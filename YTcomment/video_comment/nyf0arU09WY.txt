This girl I have been seeing is actually named Claire lmao
How about if you've been with your children's mother for 12 years?And you've been trying for the last year and a 1/2 to win her back.And you keep sabotaging it by stupid comments.And now she's talking to somebody else.. i just know things could be different.But sometimes I'm arrogant and say stupid stuff.And I know we could be a happy family again.Your help will be greatly appreciated
hey are you still responding… i am in need of a some help
Hi my wife was sexually abused when she was young so she is not wanting sex with me I am not pushing for that she just slowly went off and I was to ignorant to think we have had arguments and now she wants to leave it is difficult for us to move there’s no where to go for acomadation so we are still living in the same house is
Zero contact.....ok.....we have a child together, so how does thar work.....??!!
I know this is older but she’s such a cute one 🙃
Ilovethis girl❤😊
I'm watching this on 2024
Question..what 3 texts will get me Kate Spring?
I broke up with ex my girlfriend of 2.5 years and I didn't text her until 4 months after I told her I miss her and she blocked ain't that some shit.
So what should I do if I reestablish good text conversations with my ex, but she still declines the in person meet up? Back to no contact ?
Can text number one be like, hey Claire what is the name of that Italian restaurant in a certain area that we spoke about taking a friend there can you recall the name?
Hey if it was a long distance relationship how can I do the favour text? Could just do something that she is extremely knowledgeable about and get her insight on it?
What if she broke up with you then said dont wanna hear from you or anything you have to say and will not ever come back. Also told me i made her walk away. Should i still reach out eventually
With my luck, my ex girlfriend would be watching the same video and have a good laugh when I use these tactics
Can I win her back after hurting her repeatedly and she tells me that she doesn’t trust me anymore?
Helpful,but does,not really cover,when you also have kids,but aimed at young guns,helpful nonetheless
Hey, Kate! Thank you so much for all the useful information you provide. Is there any way I could have a private conversation with you? I’d gladly pay for it! I need some help and guidance. Thank you
Hey Kate, I am in a very new break up! It did not end horribly but we are currently not speaking and no response to my messages. We have talked about our future before our break up . I believe we do have a future and I believe she thinks that too. Thank you for your video. Any other advice on how to get her to respond or remind her of the love we had and the good times?
Hey Kate, I did what i shouldn’t have and tried to talk to her after, I’m gonna wait a little over a month to message her but do you have any advice for messing up that part? Anything I could do to reverse the effect a little or do I just wait?
🥺
Cute😊
Great video, I was in a beautiful marriage before my now ex wife left me,i still love her and most times i cant stop thinking about her, i am doing my very best to get rid of the thought of her, but i just cant, i love her so much, i dont know why i am bring this here for, i cant stop thinking about her.
did this, turns out she already has a new guy
Im gonna try this
Hi Kate; quick question - how would these apply if your ex is seeing someone? I’m guessing we should wait until shes single again?
Hi Kate idk if you can see this but plz reply if you can but I broke up with a girl a couple months ago and miss her I keep thinking of her so plz let me know you see this
Hi Kate , does rule of absence help me getting my gf even after she continue to chat with me as a friend 😔
i just called my ex gf claire!!! 🤣
what to do if she reaches out before that month is up?
We just broke up but I’m watching this in case if I still want her after months of being gone. We broke up bc of going to separate colleges. I’ve been with her for a year. Hopefully she and I will comeback some time in the future
So lets hope these tips work out 👍
I watched this video. And it made me think…I have a goal now to not contact her. That’s the goal. I deleted instagram and others. I’m goin to try to do this. But the thing is that. In 1-2 Months? Maybe i doesn’t want her anymore? It’s a win win situation. If I still feel like she’s the one? I’ll try but if she doesn’t want? It’s easy to accept? And u helped me finding a goal!! Thank u so much!
Thank you your a lifesaver bc she broke up with me today
This is really very good as compare to other
3 text is way too simple and is not  going to work with my ex. Good solid advice as a start though.
Your ex boyfriend watching your video to get you back :😏
Hey i broke up wit my girlfriend but she wants to stay connected wit me and just want a physical relationship and no strings attached.....what you suggest i should do because i really want her back......and mam please do mention that when to text her the second message of asking other things..... Plus what if she texts/calls in between the one month of time just to check on me, in what way i should attend her ? awaiting for your reply 😀  @kate Spring
But what if my ex Texts me? Am I supposed to text her back
Smart girl and advice not poisoned by PC culture
Great tips. Thank you. I really want her back
Well after i saw u , I reconsidered my opinion of getting her back 😅
How do you do the “No Contact Rule” when you have 3 children together that you have to pick up each weekend?
I almost texted her, I just got to the half way point of the no contact rule
Hey Kate. So my girlfriend just broke up with me yesterday and I've been freaking out every minute since that happened. I really think these tips will work. So thank you so much! If we work something out. I will try to remember to come back to this comment section and let you know. Again THANK YOU!!❤
Hi Kate , it's been the first time I have watched your video. And I was really inspired by the same. I could fathom out what all should be done after a broken relationship. I broke-up with my girlfriend 3 weeks back and that has nearly devastated me . I tried accepting all my mistakes but nothing could be a panacea and all she wanted was to keep out a distance from me. I tried talking to her through friends but nothing altered her firm decision and what she said was that the entire relationship has been a suffocation for her but it was not she thinks alot. I just wanna know whether her mind changes sans my presence. She hindered every possible ways of contacting her but could that help changing her impression about me ?
hi Kate, there's a way to measure how much to space out messages? thanks
Great advise  Kate
Are you single??☺️😊🥰
Nice and right on point
💯💚🔥
Well I have a question I called my ex a Bitch and she got mad and told me to never talk to her ever in life do you think these texts will work after a month
Hi everyone I'm going thru a divorce right now. How do I get my ex back
The lady broke up with me after one month of starting our relationship. Even though she cared alot for me she was just too scared to get hurt again . Her stupid ex came back into her life when everything was working out.And that reminded her of all the hurts she's had . We are still friends but she's slowly pulling away from me. And I can't move on because of all the memories we've had. I still want her but i don't know what to do to get her back
👍
Me and my girlfriend day for 2 years and no she left me and I love her so much what I must do to win back her heart please
Is this really possible ?
The girl that I’m watching this video for is also named Claire. Wow
Should like I block her or no?
My ex broke up because she was not yet ready for relationship whereas I always asked her out for a date but she eventually ignored me. Now it's been 3 weeks since I started no contact and it's her birthday the next week, is it a good opportunity to get her back?
what if she texts me?
This video deserves an award
My girlfriend of a year and a half just broke up with me. I’m crushed. I really hope this works because she helped me to be happier than ever before. On day 8 now
What if my ex got new bf within a month..?
This is 100% right ive been doing this for years and it always works
I’ll give it the 1 month treatment and then tell her how my test went and say that it reminded me of our face time calls and how hard she always would work on her assignments then say that I hope you have been well
I wanna do this but I’m afraid she’ll find someone else after being absent for a month
What if you tried to do the no contact but she messages you.
What if your ex texts u first in the 4 weeks??
I was fool for cheating on my x thank you for the video it has got me back with her God bless you 🙏❤️
is 6 months enough space?
Thank you
Helped me very much thanks kate
What happens when kids are involved? My oldest doesn’t want me to be her dad anymore, so my ex has chosen the kids to focus on over our relationship however she can’t live her life ruled by our kids
Should you unfriend her on social media ?
Thank you
🔥
You have amazing eyes...
Thanks it really help 🤩👍🏾
Well I hope this works
I need to talk about my relationship personally
Hey Kate, are you using these three texts in one conversation? Like one text after another or is this over a series of different conversations ?  If it's in one conversation I don't think that's wise asking her out on the first text interaction after no contact, you have to build up to that.
What if her birthday is coming up in a few days and just broke up? Text her saying happy birthday and that’s it, or not text her at all? Reason broke up is cause she said quarantine and she feels like we aren’t dating because we can’t go anywhere or adventure and she’s bored  just being locked in at home
I know this is a late comment but I’ve waited 5 months you think it’s time?
thanks for the tips kate. i hope she will text me later 😂
Can i ask her bestfriend if she still loves me or just misses me?
Just wondering is it ok to send ex girlfriend flowers after the 30 day no contact?
what if its been a 3 years is enough of a break lol
I made a freaking mistake breaking up
What does it mean when your ex whats to still hug u and kiss u but just wants to be friends
Haven't spoken to her in nearly three years but found out she's single and focusing on her career.
This is sooo weird. My ex’s name is Claire.
Kate, i need your advice on something. Me and my ex broke up but we still live in the same house with each of our kids. And we talk and see each other daily.
Caught my 9 year old brother watching this😂
Valentine’s Day is in two weeks should I text her just saying if you wanna hang if you don’t have plans if you do it’s all good just hate for you to be alone on valentines?or is it too soon I know you said thirty days but I feel like It wouldn’t be right not to at least text her on that day .....thoughts?
my ex cheated on me.. she is dating a new guy now.. but i still love her n want her back...please suggest me what do i do
I did no contact for a month, within that time she responded to my insta story and I just liked the message. She then unfollowed me a week later on Instagram and Twitter, but not Snapchat. I sent her the memory text but all she did was “love” the iMessage. I’ve since gone no contact, I don’t know what my next move should be?
Now i want Kate back.......lol
what do you do if they text you during no contact
Hi Kate, I got dumped by my ex a few months ago and I already did an unintentional no contact period (was kinda mad at her), I want to know what to say without looking desperate?
How can I make someone feel ready for a relationship? And that it's not lots to take on. I need to reassure her of that.
What if she keeps contacting me?
There’s no clear cut way to get anyone back. If a person wants you back and you don’t mess it up you can get the person back. If they don’t want you, then nothing you can do will win them over. Nice video! Love the graphic editions but this isn’t the blueprint because nothing is guaranteed.
What would your advice be for getting back an ex long distance? Thanks
Hope mah girlfriend will come back 🥺🥺
WOW! YOU LOOK AMAZING 👍😁
beautiful coach
I seriously have crush on you ,although I found u for the first time 😂
What if shes dateing someone
Hey Kate, how do I go about the rule of absent when I have a 1 1/2 year old son with her? Every time I text her I ask her about my son and when I can see him. She usually says he’s good and I can see him later that day but has been cancelling out on me when I want to see him. 😔
I can't leave without her she is angry with me and she always fight with for simple reason 😞
What to do if she keep calling me every night ?( we are on a break)
I don't believe in no contact. I texted my ex everyday.  It took almost 2 weeks and things are  so much better. She tells me she loves me 5 or 6 times a day. I believe if you want to lose her for good go with no contact. I mean it just didn't make no sense to me but everyone is different
Me and my girlfriend broke up but I did the braking up for the reason being she said she doesn't love me anymore and i have been missing her alot and i want her back but she said she hates me so what must I do
Thank u soo muh sis....for two years I tried soo mny ways but nothing worked out. But urs video hev  relaxed me n hev given me a positive way of moving ahead. Hope it works out
When we go on  no contact .... Will she get into relationships with someone else??
Thank you. Your advise is fantastic. Thank you for taking up time to help out those in dire need of good advice.
Hey please i need ur help or advice. My girlfriend dump me over a week ago and the next day we hang out and she says the last month ive been distant and show her no attention and i really love her and want tonchange i didnt think she would leave me. Well she said i have to show her i will change and be consistent before she decides well two days ago five days later she gets mean and not answering me and then says i cant do this ur pushing to much on me and later says we can be friends but thats it. I havent text her in two days what do i do i want her back? Please help me
What if y’all dated for 1 year and 8 months and 2 years already passed and haven’t done any contact ?
I just don't necessarily believe in the no contact rule, especially if she's expecting a guy to change his ways and be that person she always wanted him to be.  If you don't contact her for a month it just gives you and her more time to move on and also drags on the feeling of hope.  You definitely shouldn't smother her with texts and affection but I feel its ok to initiate the conversation once in a while showing her the ways you are changing, that you still care, and that you're committed to bettering yourself and the relationship.  Then you need to stay true to your word ALWAYS, never back track or revert to your old self, actually be that person she has expected of you that you can slowly but surely make your way back to her good graces.
Great video Kate what about our own social accounts? Should we still post photos to Instagram and snapchat stories or stop for the 1 months period?
Kate: i just met my ex yesterday after long time no See. Asked for meeting to get closure.  Thanked her for meeting me today and i responded that seeing her it made it easier for me. We then said our goodbyes but now, three hours later, she wants to know why the meeting made it easier for me. (She is seeing a new guy btw)  What do I do???
I'm already blocked 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hi  Thanks for supporting people How should I contact with you personally I have problem please
What if u have texted her after break up and you said few mean things, can it work!?
What if she has a rebound, does the no contact rule apply? Or does any of this still apply?
I love a girl ba she loves someone who doesnt get time for her...what should i do
My X and I broke up....and have figth many times....but now were friends and we're ok...we texting each other...at it was just all sticker she reply to me...but we're having a conversation,,how is that is this an indication that she love...she was the one who broke up with me
My now recent ex is talking with her old ex again and he pretty much just used her for sex and left her. Now she is also talking to me but claims she just wants to "mess" around like a fwb thing and says she isn't ready to date again yet but she says she misses me and loves me. I tried the whole not messaging her idea even on social media but its hard when we literally just broken up. Any ideas?
I have a question my ex dropped a boy to go out with me then dumped me to go out with the same boy it's been like 2 years and I just realised how much I miss her please help me
I deleted all of our photos, but I found a video of her playing with my dog, could I send this after a while and say I was going through my gallery and this made me think of you
Hey Kate my question is I asked my ex girlfriend if she would give me another chance and she kept telling me that she wouldn't be happy if we got back together I need help I don't know what to do! I want to be with her so bad
@Kate Spring can we date☺☺☺
What if she said she wants to be just friends tho?
Hello My girlfriend don't want to see me again Because I hurt her I say her sorry so many times But she still hate me But I don't want to lose her She told me I'm her worst boyfriend Now I don't know what can I do Please help me She is very honest and kind She blocked my no. Everywhere
The break up wasnt a bad one. I made her laugh shortly after. Did no contact for a week then got a message asking how i was. I was short and up beat but I ended it there because I didn't want to start over this no contact. Her response was good she said that's great! have fun! My question Kate is. Did she take it as a rude response to her reaching out or see it as a good response?
What about a snapchat streak? Should I keep it up or break it!
Fuck my ex what’s Kate’s number
Would these methods still apply if me and my ex haven’t talked for a year. My ex and I recently started chatting over text. I thought I saw her in a new car and i texted her asking if it was her that I saw in that car long story short sense I asked that question me and her have been talking sense then. She seems to take an interest in what’s going on in my life and she responds pretty quick but idk if those are signs that she’s still interested.   Can someone please respond she still means a lot to me
What if she is dating someone else?
What if your ex just broke up with you and still wants to be best friends and she still texts you everyday, how am I supposed to make her miss me then?
okay , so was successful sending the good memory text, had a good short conversation, what’s next? how long do i wait to text her again?
She said to me that she likes someone else and I just broke down crying, my friends said what's wrong to me and I just cried for 3 hours, how do I talk to her when I'm hurting while talking..?
What if you're on a break where you are trying to stay friends and she texts you first?
I came through this channel. Really I need to contact you
What if you have a child together and can't avoid speaking?
i know she miss me cause her friends say that but i don’t know what to do.. and she’s so hot and gorgeous i miss her:/
Don't text, dont call her.. if she likes you she will contact you. Took me one month with zero contact. In that time I learned to move forward and got 3 different ladies that have dated and still want me. As much a I hurt and still do today she called me crying. I'm with her now and i dont know how things will turn out. I have refused to let her get me into bed and yes, she has tried to. She can either fight for me now or lose me. P.s I'm 45 and I was her for only 3 months  You!! Are worth more than they think so believe in yourself and always be positive
What if she's married?
What if after breaking up with me she asked if we could still be friends or meet ahead in time for coffee and I declined? Didn't really wanna sound like a friendzoned fool by saying "oh yes let's be friends"... Would it still work?
What if I've never had a girlfriend
I hope u can help me Damn it's really sucks it happened to me too she dumped me cuz of her parents🥺 we were on LDR she dumped me like 2 days ago and I cried every night and her dad told her that she can date when she is 18 and then I told her I'm willing to wait for her but she keeps pushing me away she said if she doesn't move on now it will be hard for her I'm super dead from inside now i really love her and I don't want her be with a other guy I really want to get with her again.
hi Kate get well soon you look great,
Hi I made a lot of mistakes while with my ex. Mistakes I regret doing and could take back if I could. She is the only girl I want to be with and the only girl I will ever love but my actions shows otherwise. She is done with me but I still love her deeply what do I do 😭
What if you're the one that broke up with her?¿
what if its only been 1 day since you haven't spoken to her and tommorrow's her birthday?? );
Tried no contact and 3 days later she texted me a picture of her wearing my shirt even though she said were done talking.. what do i do ?!?
Hey what do I do if she accuses you of liking another girl
so what do i do if they text me before 30 days up! ignore them!? or what
Hey Kate , my problem was totally different 😶 . Look the matter is my girl left me just became she blindly had trust on her bestie and her bestie made her brainwash,  since this things are happened last 2 years ago but still i want her because she is the one whom i had loved actually she is my First love and i can't get over. I really don't know  why myself don't want to leave or just let stop thinking about her may be because we had a lot of good memories together but i really don't know how to get her back through i have tried my best😔 Please help me💌
My ex broke up with me saying there are things I need to work on. I asked if we could be together in the future she said yes, but not in the near future. I asked her how would she know I've improved if we're not in contact? She said we shouldn't talk until Sept and we can catch up then. Should I wait until September (it's mid July now, she broke up with me early July)? Or start in mid August?
okayyy soo like i’m fucked cause i started texting her a lot after the break up and now she hates me and i’m blocked:(
My fiance just a month before our wedding asked me to move out saying it felt like the wedding had not been a priority for us and that it scared her and we needed space to figure out where our priorities lie. A week later she decides we are done and has yet to give me a reason as to why. She has blocked me on all social media to the point of deleting her Facebook and I'm sure she has blocked my number. The whole relationship was perfect up until this point. I know for a fact there is nobody else. But I am still at a loss on how to break down the walls and get her to talk besides just showing up at the house one day when she doesn't have the kids and try to talk to her. What should I do?
What if she left u for somebody else
Is 5 months long of an absence?
I broke up and blocked my ex’s # over a misunderstanding and it really hurt her. She pleaded and begged that I wouldn’t break up with her and I was pretty cold. I realize now that I should have talked it through and am curious how to get her back . We both def loved each other . She’s pretty mad right now and thinks I don’t really care
How do I do this for a long distance relationship?
U r so.. beautiful dear
Does this still work? just curios
You should make a video about how to get over a break up. That would help a lot 🙂 also maybe how to end things on a good note
You look perfect in the dress 👗 in this video
Kate we love you!!!
What if you have a streak with her on sc
my ex find me back !!!!
Should I try this?
one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen ❤🤩
How do you do no contact when you have a child together together and are still living together because of your lease?
Kate you're super hot
My ex dumped me because I questioned her twice about a guy who was her cousin, how do I win her back
Kate,  My long distance girlfriend has just had her mum die of cancer. We were in contact before the death although it was less because she was always so busy helping her. She always said she loved and missed me when we did speak/text. After asking her if she would like to talk following her mum's death she told me she needs to think about what to do in life now and that includes our relationship. Now I don't want to keep being first to send a message but she's not sending any. I've been sending a supportive message once a week for two weeks now and receiving short responses. Have you got any advice or tips on what I can do from here? I don't want to loose her.
Does this have a chance to work if she broke up with me? After 2 years of dating🤧
Hi beautiful
i really needed this video. thank you! </3
Thank you kate spring. This was a big help in my situation and my feelings I just wish there was more like you and  I hope I'm not saying this wrong but I guess the word would be rationalized like you do... awesome  job
I want to ask some personal questions
you look 🔥
Hey Kate, question for you! for the last few months this girl and i where really hitting things off talk regularly, hangout and would see each other at work (we are co-workers) things were amazing no fighting or anything and recently she got super quiet and I gave it a few days without talking to her because I understood her personal problems so gave her some space. once I messaged her after that period she said she isn't ready for a relationship because she has family problems to attend to and I don't know how to react to this. ofcourse im giving her space but what else can do I? I don't wanna be come absent from her life or make things awkward at work what should I do?
What if she’s dating someone already
My ex fell in love with my best friend whilst dating me  I feel sick thinking of the two of them making out  What do i do?
Wow. Kate, you really are Gorgeous
Crazy that this shit would lowkey work... wish I would've seen this a couple months ago. I butchered the no contact rule 😭
But she blocked me😔
Not trying get my ex back just saying you're beautiful just reminding you ;)
Are you Brad Browning's ex and now you have a mutual business and try to get each other back but you can't because you're both too good at this ?
I tried one month. She texted me wishing me good luck with the fast. I answered her lightly. No I am halfway through another month of absence. I really don't know what to say when I do contact her. I can't think of something good to ask her about following the examples. Can I just send her a simple text saying that I miss her and I'm sad over how things went?
What about if she onely send me pictures and she onely wan me on bed what should I do she call me everyday
Thank you Kate! Another great video!! You look amazing as usual 😊❤
I need your email
What can I text you in order to get you ?
what if within this one month periods they get along with someone else?
Fuck her I want you lol
Need your expertise!
What if me and her are on speaking terms now. I did the no contact rule buh I only did it for a week and not a month because I didn’t know about the no contact rule so I screwed that up. Buh me and her are on speaking terms and she says she wants to meet up with me and she even picked a few places for me and her to go. We did a little bit of flirting buh it wasn’t anything serious. Buh am I on a good track? We text daily buh it’s normally lighthearted small talk.
Oh shit, i just realized my ex did the 3 things to get me back.  She must have seen this video, lol.
Hi! What if she doesn't care anymore, and she doesn't trust you anymore, but she misses you and she still chatting you??
What ex? Hi Kate, your beautiful! Will you marry me?💍💐
what if we have a snapchat streak and were trying to keep it
Nooo, the girl I lost two days ago is called Clare. Why
What if we have a snapchat streak going and i’m trying to have no communication at all for the month ?
What if she's already texted you saying she misses you, and you accidentally said how much you miss her and although you know you can't be together at that moment you hope that it could work out in the future? Did I fuck it up?
What if you cheated once she took u back then caught u flirting  when going thru ur phone n took u back and then caught you doing it again... 🤔 but this time u really stopped drinking
Now... What to do if she texts you back in less than 30 days???
What if they use the month of no contact to be a hoe?
I want to do no contact but she is in my class so what do I do just ignore her?
Me and my girlfriend taught bcoz she misunderstands me bcoz I changed some truths to lies bcoz of her actually but she mis understand me as I said the lies first and after said the truth...but what I said to her first are truths and after I turned them into blows bcoz of her but now she cuts all communication channels except text message channel and call...
Hi Kate My Ex and I  were together a year and live together 6months. She has decided that she needs space and is moving out. She still msgs me and comes over crying that she misses  and loves me - but moving out is the best thing for her to do for her life. She doesn't want to but thinks she needs to. The move is happening but she still msges me. I feel that she is moving forward in her life without me. She isn't gonna be far from me. Should I start just ignoring her why would she keep messaging me and want to see me if she's moving out
What should i do if she text me first or calling me?
We kind of had our closure a month ago but next week is her birthday and she told me that she wants me there to feel good. I dont even know if I should text her happy birthday or what to say
Hey Kate! During no contact she contacted me! Then after some back and forth I told her we'll talk soon since I'm busy doing something. Then she blocked me again. Now what? :(
I love u Kate
I was going out with her every weekend and texting her very day for 1.5 months. She says she likes me, but she doesn't feel emotional connection. My mistake is that I have never expressed my love to her until it really broke up. There are many things I want to talk to her.
The funny thing is that my Xs name is kate
Much love from China ❤️❤️❤️ what's your Instagram?
I forgot my girlfren wen i was watchjng u😘😘😘
Thx
your so beautiful ,how to make you my girlfrd .so cute
So far so good, been doing this tactic for 3 days now and she already misses me. She says that she wants to put all of this behind us and hopefully still think about us getting back together. But it’s signs I feel like where she is very doubtful of letting it happen. I feel as me doing this absence rule she responded to me today saying “I’m still thinking you know, trying to confirm myself. Thank you for checking on me I feel a lot better. I’ve been learning how to be comfortable with myself... by myself” but she says she still loves me. I feel as if I continue to do this 30 period she may just lose interest
What if she calls before a month?
What if my ex is still text me back she said she needs  a break i have sub to your channel
We want to be more assertive but can’t that he smothering? Like if I say, “ hey let’s go to the movies on Friday” or is it only needy if she is busy and I keep trying to hang out? Or should I be fine if I keep my attempts to hang out spread apart by a few days or weeks..?   Btw, she’s my ex and starting to date a new guy.
Hey Kate! We follow each other on instagram, should i blocked or what should i do? Just leave it there and just dont like her pictures?  Taking the absence time by now ..

Is no contact going to work if I go to college with them and have classes with them, I have tried it for a few days so far and just ignored them completely and not replied if they spoke in person?? Is that the right thing to do
So what do I do if she messages me before the month of no contact is over
Love friends! My ex and I watch the whole series together almost twice
Hey Kate my name is john I also got a problem with my Ex girlfriend is been now three months and I Don't what to do last week Saturday I meet her in the bus and i just greet her and ask her where she going
Can I keep a Snapchat streak..? And what if for the first week I was super clingy and apologizing and I think she already has another guy in mind? Still hope?
Its been since September.  She lives in Cuba and in Miami..she is close to my family and now with a guy namef Miguel.. Said he's bellísimo and that realky triggered me i haven't slept good in days .. It's been 3 days now since i haven't texted her in fb.. I fought to be with her and so much drama and offers me to be just friends.. It hurts me and i tried and it didn't work out for me it's a huge disrespect to me..   How do i get her back? She jealous type and doesn't really give much affection but i knew she liked me.. Do i just dance with some girl when i go back to Cuba? Would that catch her to come over to me weather she pulls my ear ? (I just imagine she will do that but i don't think so)
We work together so how do I stop seing her ?
Its been two years, and she tells me loves some other guy, but she still contacts me
I got blocked on snapchat but i still still have her number,GOOD Thing snap is not the only thing in the world
I just recently got out of a relationship where she wanted time to herself and find true happiness. We were a little toxic for the last 5 months of our relationship, but i still love and want her to be a part of my life. I see us getting out of the toxicity but she does not. What do i do? I am extremely devastated:(
I subscribed, thank you.. Going through some tough times right now, 2 weeks out of a breakup.
kate spring will it work?
Realistically speaking if the first one (1st text) works then how do you space out the three texts?
If she follows me on social media, do I block her if I were to follow the rules of absence? In order for her to not see my activities.
Ok. So I tried to follow the no contact rule.. FAILED! We still kept contact. Sometimes we argued..I'd ask her out, she'd ask me out...I did go to therapy for my own benefit. Anyways long story short. She's really sweet to me again and wants to see me. When we are together she laughs at everything I say and even make jokes...I asked her what her goal was and she said that she wants to work on our relationship. That she thinks we can do it. I know we can do it but I'm like "ttthpt"..I don't know what to do now. It's been six months and I feel awesome! We were married for 6 years and have a daughter...anyways I don't know if this stuff really works but you should definitely not initiate contact. And don't be needy. Be a strong independent man and put yourself together damn it!
Kate, I am confused about the 2nd text..  Please help me with that..
Kate thats a very sweet message considering I was the one who dumped her a year ago, this literally killed her. I dumped her as there was a possibility I would have to move out of EU and she would not have come along.   She met a guy soon after we broke up and has been with him ever since. When I finally got a job in Dec-18 I contacted her, 3 weeks ago I apologized (but not needy) informing her that I would like to have her back. Probably it was too quick and fast to absorb. She blew me away in short mentioning that she is happy with someone else. I responded saying "I'm cool and would be there for her if she needed anything", rather needy I would say as it was in a week moment.   I am now employing the rule of no contact / absence. I think that your commentary would have no effect on the present situation as I would be coming across as more desparate subsequent to the 30 days no contact rule!
love u keep it up
What should I do if we were long distance (shes in Miami Im in Boston), it's been a month of no contact, I didn't show any weakness/feminine response when she ended things but merely stopped answering her (she reached out several times afterward via snap and text, probably just for validation as I think she still likes me), we just started snapchatting again lightly, and my friends and I booked a trip to Miami in a few weeks.  How Should I go about rekindling things while I'm there?  Miami was my friends' ideas (I wanted to go to Cabo); but they say that I should snap or facetime her when we get to the hotel or are on the beach and surprise her, which I think is a good idea, but I want to make sure that I say the right things to get her to see me while I'm there and try to re-spark things.
This is really hard😖😖 if this really works... I owe u😊 I really want her back.😣
Hi, Kate! Agreed .
My girlfriend dumped me after I told her i was starting to get feelings for her, she tells me she wants to be with me but doesn't want to get hurt. We were together for only 2 months. It feels like a test, so I'm going to play her at her own game and follow the tips in this vid. Wish me luck boys... 😎
My case is a hopeless and an ultra-rare one tbh.. Both of us don't wanna breakup but we are forced to.. It is personal tbh and I can't say it publicly.. Kate I really need your help because I seriously can't "move on".. Kate and anyone who is a dating expert, I politely ask you to dm on my insta @ahmed_afify03 Thanks
Me and my ex broke up 3 months ago. After 50 days of no contact i reached out to her and things went really well. She showed dozens of signs she wanted to get back together. She texts me every day all day and we hook up all the time. I recently made the mistake of getting jealous and confessing my love for her. She didn't reject me but she didn't take me back either. She basically said she's confused, likes the way things are, and doesn't want anything to change right now. Should I keep going with the flow now that I showed her my hand or go back into no contact and start again?
Please let me how much time frame should have to be their after 1st text ?
Your beautiful
What if I contacted right after the breakup.
Any ideas on what to do if she doesn't reply to the first message? Sent a similar one to i was doing blah blah reminded me of blah blah hope you're doing well. I've waited 6 weeks. Messaged her on WhatsApp and still unread (not been blocked). At this point I'm not even that fussed about getting back with her I just want to sit down and talk about why we broke up.
Kate, after the break up, upto almost 3 months i did everything that u should not do and now i am on no contact for 2 weeks. what should i do now?
I broke up with her after a bad argument and i thought it was just going to go over our heads and get back together the next day but it was serious this time.... she felt hurt,  and she told me she needed some and only time will tell if we’re meant to be.   She blocked me off her twitter but after a day again she unblocked me for some reason.   She keeps giving me mixed messages.   One she says she wants to move on and it be best for us to not date cus we are toxic. But then she says she misses me and although she says she doesn’t want me, it doesn’t necessarily mean she doesn’t. “ if you want me you’ll fight for me”. ....... I don’t know what to think anymore. I mest up by stalking her and getting jealous that she liked some guy’s picture after our 5th day being broken up.  And I felt like I pushed her back even more.... I don’t know what to do :(
I did the first step and I remind her and in the end of msg I wrote how you have been?  She answered : I'm fine.  And I send: good to hear that.  But she didn't talk about what I remind her and she didn't ask how I am !! 😐  What I must to do ?
What if it is 4months ago? Ahahah
plz talk about ldr kate...ldr really hard 😥
I'm still block since Thanksgiving and almost 3 months now I'm thinking about moving forward and I'm dating someone else now
Hi Kate    What do I do if my ex and I have a kid together?  How do I handle the one month no contact?  I have him every other weekend
Would it work if she is a full time mom and teacher? She left me because i lost my job and my apartment. I was a superintendent
What if your ex girlfriend tells u to move on but still likes your instagram picture?
What if I made her real mad
Hi Kate I was wondering when your ex leaves you with "I hope we can still talk from time to time" is that a good sign to take into account or is it better to move on? Also I survived the first 48 hours of the no contact rule
We already broken up about 1.5 months ago,  within this time I tried to convince her that how much I love her but everytime I want to talk to her like delightful conversation, she always talk to me like in a rudely manner. Due to which we had a lot of fight between these day. Now please help me to get her back...
Well i begged and pleaded for 2weeks now...what do i do? No contact?
You're a great instructor,the tone of your voice,how you appeal to the sense are amazing...In fact,these lessons of life are useful for other sort of friendships as well...As for me,I am lucky to have had enough experience to understand the fact that no one of the opposite sex can make us a 'whole'...The moment we understand that,and truly feel it,and get that mentality into our perspective,we will have learned to never hold onto anything as well...
Hey Kate.. What to do when ex wants to become friends after breakup..?  Can I get her back being as a friend.. Plz help me
Hey...my girlfriend told we need to take some time apart so that she can figure out her feelings.  She says she needs space and told me the spark is gone. .  What should I do to make things work out again.  I really love her so much and I'd do anything to get her back. We broke up yesterday and I went to talk to her about it. I told her to take all the time in the world.  What shud i be texting her?
IT WORKED
3 years since our breakup, and I still miss her so much. She hasn’t blocked me from instagram but she’s blocked me from everything else. We started talking again 2 months ago but then we fought and went back to our old ways. I miss her so much.
Thank you for the advice! I just messaged my ex with my genuine thoughts.  You gave me a courage to message her!  I don’t think she will reply me, but I don’t regret. Thank you!!
I just talked to a girl and I connected with her we talked for 4to5 days then I gave her that leave of absence, her birthday is coming how should I wish her ? Please help
I would suggest 7 days everyone's relationship is different especially if you guys where's together every day I broke no contact after 5 days in I got a response I'm trying not to push it too far
Instead of 30 days can it be 3 days? I can’t wait that long
OMG you is so beautiful💯💯💯💯💯😘👰🙏
Kate.. She breakup with me just because of some shit reasons now.. She says i dont like you and i want breakup how i convince her...😰😭
Remember guys your value becomes higher when youre less available. No contact is powerful.
Hey I have a question should I wait for her to message me or should I message her
Plz make video in Hindi language or Hindi texts below
After break up I made many messages on her phone What should I do ?
What if my ex and I talk everyday? And if I block her she'll make a new account to text me we call a lot (not my choice but I cant help but picking it up) we flirt on call and we always talk about us being together but shes got a guy now and we still do it talk about that stuff like she tells me she loves me she says all of this when we're on call and I cant move on because I neex her in my life like me and hr act like we are together but we're not
What if she works next to me and still wants to be friends?
But what if she finds another boyfriend during that month of absence?
Thank you
Great advice thanks
It been almost 3 years since me and my ex talked but for some reason i feel well talk eventually..shes had friend message me.. during the relationship i would say i had the upper hand like she really really loved me and i didnt show her the attention she deserved but towards the end i did but felt it was to late by then.. out of no were she jus left my house one day said everything was fine and got home texted me and said i cant do this anymore and that was it she was with someone but now they broke up..ive messaged her alot during the time but idk im jus confused it like when she was around i didnt care as much but now that im older i feel she was the one
What if she says no to the meet up?
I'm on no contact for a little over a month, disregarding a few views of the snapshot story. I saw a couple days ago she posted a picture with another dude (arms wrapped around him). It felt like a punch to the gut when I saw it.  Not sure where I should go from here.  I told her after the breakup we should maybe grab a coffee or something when we get back from the holidays, and she responded partially agreeing. I'm not sure where to go from here.  I am constantly viewing her Instagram / Twitter/ FB to see what she's been up too. I need to stop that, but its hard. Someone, please advise.
Hi Kate, how can you apply the rule of absence when we have a kid together
Kate's a pimp though. Reading her comments you can tell she knows how to charm a boy and even a man. It takes a great, and I mean a great man like myself for Kate to submit and get dominated.
She's not that attractive
How do i get a girl back that I have a 1 year old with? I have to be in contact with her
Uhm and what if my ex pretty much opens all of my insta and snap stories as soon as possible?
Omg! Kate!!!  I was crying because I wanted my ex back, but now I just want to  watch more of your videos. You are gorgeous!
why you so cute
Bt i luv u
I am not an expert or anything but i think that if your girlfriend - boyfriend broke up with you even if you do no contact for a month it's not the right move to text them for whatever reason , because u put them in a dominant position and you don't want that... For a relationship to work both have to be equal if she - he dumped you for whatever reason they have to try to get you back in their life not you. Yes you can give them a chance if you really  want them back but they have to work for this.
Hi there  I had a fight n arguments with my girlfriend 7 days ago ... Since  then she is not picking up my phone and nor she is reading my msgs... She never blocked me ...n she never said I going to leave u ...  I m not able to understand what she's up to... I miss her every day ...

I don't have friend circle no friends at all only her n we r been dating for past 8+ years and we have been meeting every day ... now  i don't want to lose her ... plz help plz
The love of my life left me today I love her so much and I really need her back
Hi Kate, my girlfriend cooled off with me, I asked her why she said she's stressed with work, family and suffocated with our relationship, constant fighting and the screenshot i sent her of someone bashing her and she believed i has something to do with it even I don't, I told her I'll wait then she said no don't wait if you want to wait it's your discretion, and then she said I know you miss everything about us don't worry i'll give it i'm okay,  i9t made me confuse, because when she said i shouldn't wait it sounds like she's not coming back anymore, right now it's a week since she took a break from me, I sent her messages it's only being seen by her no reply, she allowed me to call once only for 5 mins however she sounds really not interested to answer my questions, right now I'm no longer messaging her, I guess my question is should I let her go? Should I still wait for her? I have a feeling that she's dating someone else already, this is the 2nd time we broke up the last break up she said she did not see anyone but right now I have a doubt that she's seeing someone new, I don't know what to do, I hope you can advise me. Thank you
Hey Kate! Seen your video and i loved every bit of it. My scenario is little bit different from everyone actually. How can i mail you personally everything ?
Hi ! I’ve just broken up this week and I saw this video. I really wanna win her back. I’m not sure if she’s having another guy. I heard that she’s stressed these days. Should I give her some time and do what u mentioned in the videos after a month ? Or are there anything else I can do right now ? I feel desperate and I’m afraid she’d meet another during that 1 month time. Thank you
I'm definitely moving to the west coast of Canada :-)
Kate you look absolutely amazing! :)
Hey,  in my case my girl friend didn't forget her ex (first love) and she fell into love me after few months, she couldn't forget him and she's still stalking him.  She asked me some time,  but i expressed how i felt.  Now she's asking some gap between our relation. Can you plz help me how can my girl friend forget her ex completely. Eagerly waiting for your video🙂
How do I get my ex back if she has me blocked on everything and she moved to another state . She claims that I hurt her Because of all the arguing and not listening to her about certain things she expressed to me. I love her and I want to fix things and be happy with her again. Please help
This is good info. It's working. Holy crap.
Hi Kate. My girl broke up with me today. She needs more time spent with herself and family. I didn't like that at times as we would only hang out once a week sometimes. She told me I was too controlling and I regret the things I said. I asked to call her tomorrow before I saw this video. Do you recommend calling her? And if so what do I say
what should you do if you texted "hey" and never received a response back..this was before i watched this video ofc.
What if it's been nearly a year we've been on and off and she seems to hate me and ignore everything I say?
Lovve you again
What if your ex is dating ur best friend now
Tnk u for the information
Hey Kate, I was dating this girl for about 6 weeks and everything was great up until she had some issues with her job and had to leave it. She seemed caught up in what was going on in her life and slowly faded away, ultimately ghosting me. I understood, moved on and we had zero contact over the next 2 months. Then I noticed that she suddenly started watching all of my SC stories, a lot of times being one of the first people to do so. I heard she got a new job, so maybe things are better for her. Do you think it's worth reaching out to her? If so, any advice on how to approach her?
The gurl im trying to get back is also named claire
What to do if your ex had a boyfriend and they just broke up but you want to get back to your ex?

Who else didint even last a week with your gf but want her back
What should I text her after the first meeting? I went through the 30 days no contact, then replied to her messages and as we met, I obviously noticed she is still very attracted to me and sad about the breakup. I don't want to rush things. So what should I text her now?
My ex responded positively to The Reminder Text but she took 24 hours to reply...what does this mean ? PLEASE HELP !!  P.S. I replied to her 4 hours afterwards but still haven’t heard back from her yet (this was earlier today)
It’s my ex’s birthday next week. It hasn’t been 30 days, but should I tell her happy birthday? How should I go about this?
hi Kate Spring, i am new on your channel, i went on a no contact after , kinda begging and pleading, for a month, during this month she tried to add me from a fake account but i did not add her, after a month today i just send , "hi can you tell me the name of that restaurant where we used to go for buffet, i need to book it to go there with a friend" she does replied in a minute the name of the restaurant and in the same message she said dont send any message.. " she always say this i dont know what is wrong with her, we had an intense relation of about 2 years.
It's been 3 weeks of our break up!  He deleted my contact.. It's an long distance relationship!
Kate, you're hot.  Are you single??
Omfg the girl im trying to get back is named Claire
Do u hav any ideas to help me I just broke up and she lost the spark
Can the rule of absence work in a few weeks
Hey me and my ex was in long distance relationship for month but she told me that she doesn't feel anything now and that she wants to be only friend. My friend told me that she is still into me. I asked her why she wants to brake up,she said that ill find somebody else who is better then her. Can u please tell me what should i do? Cuz i really love her...
Love you
Omg this is helping
A month is a long damn time
What do you do when after the no contact rule, you text her sometime okayish and she sends back a negative response
What do I do if I’ve been contacting her ever since our break up and I sorta had a melt down the second day and called her saying I missed her and now I’ve just been sorta bothering her but not annoying her please help me
So, my ex-girlfriend broke up with me in January. 5 months later she finally texted me and did that every month after. Last week, we've texted for a week and I told her to stop texting me. I didn't tell her why but it was because she drinks too much. I feel like I screwed up because I really do want her back.
Why am I watching this, I’ve never had a girlfriend in the first place 😂
Hey Kate , my ex texted me about a month ago telling me she was going through old things in her room and just wanted to see how I was doing (I figured she was going through old memories). At first I thought it might be she just misses but then I started to think bout it more and thought maybe she just genuinely wants to know how I’m doing. What do you think? I texted her back and kept it short , the whole “I’ve been good I hope the same on your end god bless”.
My ex broke up with me because she’s not comfortable with romanticism and feels uncomfortable when we’d kiss or hold hands   We was a long distance relationship and we only meet once for a week when she discovered that she is uncomfortable with romanticism.  Rk she just wants to be friends and she still text me almost everyday(I’m 18 shes 17)  Do you think this could still have a good chance of working?
Wow ur so hot
Nice video
How does the rule of absence work whenever you still have a class in college with her ?
DAMN Kate
This has actually worked. I got her back. We're in regular contact now. Thanks so much Kate. Ill be sure to recommend you. xx
What if were in a long distance relationship do I still follow the same steps
I've been with my ex for 10 months, first 5 months were the best until I lost my job and we started arguing every week. We would break up and get back together on a weekly basis. Until one day we ended completely I tried to get back with her but now she is very angry at me only remembers fighting all the bad things we said to each other. But she contacts me every 2 or 3 days to either tell me I'm going out with other woman or just to argue. I pleaded with her to try to work things out since she's contacting me but 3 times already she has said she'll think it over and she doesn't seem to make up her mind but it never fails her text after 3 days. What should I do?
You're so gorgeous!
Hey Kate what should I do to get my ex back. We barely got to know each other for a week and we jumped into the relationship way too quick. Yesterday we mutually split however ik she still has something in her heart for me. What should I do cause she’s one of the good ones and I can’t let go of that
Hey Kate, my ex girlfriend and I broke up after 3 months because she said she wasn’t ready to be in a relationship. Tried being friends for 2 weeks after but it didn’t work out and told her to cut off communication for a while. It’s been over a month, so should I try and reach out to her again? She was a bit confusing because she told me she was still attracted to me and had feelings, but didn’t want the exclusive relationship status.
Awesome trick  👏 😎
Hey u look gorgeous
Well, I sent all of the avoid texts to my ex repeatedly, now she is not even replying to anything! Is there any turn back from here? Or did I loose my love of life forever?
I remind her of the old times n I made her cried I cried to is that good?
hi kate, there is this girl that i really like. Really like. I am not sure if she likes me or not. there are hints that i notice about her that tells me that she likes me and there are hints that tell me she doesnt like me. CAN YOU HELP ME!!!!!
She blocked me in May... I was stupid and I tried my other accounts to talk with her. As a result, She blocked me on every account. And best thing is, that I see her every single day. Before breakup, we were happy and saying hi any time we met. Now? I meet her and she is ignoring me. I think that I lost this fight...  Is here any possible way to feel better? Thank you Kate.
What’s the reason for recommending a month? Should this be time spent away from social media as well? Her reason for the breakup was her being the only one in a relationship out of her friends, her not thinking she can support a relationship right now and needs to focus on herself, and school/social life hard to maintain while in a relationship. We dated for a little under two years. Thanks for any advice in advance. I love how you keep up to date on comments from previous videos you’ve made. It’s awesome!
Hey thanks for these new tips! My GF broke up with me today and it hurts. We are still friends but I want to be hers now because I’m afraid she’s gonna find someone new. What do I do?!?
if she message or text us in that period..what should we reply?
she doesn't wanna even meet me face to face to settle breakup properly, will this video help too?
what do you think it means if the girl I was dating is with her ex-boyfriend who has broke up with her four times in about 4 months before she was with me and is with him again for the 5th time but we laugh and have a great time working together she still enjoy spending time with me outside of work and keeps poking and joking with me making physical contact as well as putting her hair in my face. Also when I hugged her she hug me back tighter than she has in past weeks?  Am I seeing the signals correctly does she want to be with me again even though she still with her boyfriend?
if we are doing the no contact rule , what is they she texts me and says ‘hey ‘ do I just resd it and don’t reply ?
Actually we were in relationship for 2 years and she broke up with me coz I was not behaving her as a bf rather than I was behaving with her as friend also I was having insecurity and lack of confidence due to some major problem occurred in my life,I lost all confident and I became insure..so she lost interest in me and said we should not talk to each other you are not worth for me stay away from me...what should I do, I really took our relationship granted, didn't care for her, didn't gave her much attention, it's been 2 week we had breakup , please help me to get her back
I thought I will not fall in love with any girl after break up....but saw you and I realise I was wrong ;-)
After 3 weeks of not talking to her in person or not looking and never seening her messages online, that's the time she wants to talk. She like says I'm sorry if I really hurt you and stuff. What should I do?
Would this work in my instance? My girl has had A LOT going on in her life(trying to manage 2 jobs as a single divorced mother of a young boy, who's father is slowly fading from his fatherly duties and not helping her as much anymore, trying to get her living situation in order and having her father having just had serious heart surgery and having to help him), she told me she feels we are going too fast for what she has going on in her life and she needs to get everything in order before letting me into her life and taking things slow with me when that time happens(hopefully it does) And she said she needs time right now by herself for awhile to take care of these things.. She's also the type that closes out the world when stressed out and depressed, she hardly speaks anymore because of her life around her spinning out of control..... I don't know what to do but i can't stop caring and trying to reach out to her....
I started missing her just in a week😔🤧
So me and my GF broke up 4 days ago, we didn’t talk much for the first 2 days, and she was very upset with me. Today we talked off and on and talked quite a bit  tonight, we talked about school, and prom, and she says she still loves me, just hates me for what I did, and it will be hard for her to get over it, does this sound like we’re on track to getting back together? I apologized for my mistake, and it seems we’re doing good, just want some other people’s opinions. We’ve  been dating for about 2 years!
Does the rule of absence apply to 3 month relationships too?
Tytytytytyyyyyy
Is 6 months of no contact too late?
I accidentally said something  in the wrong way and she took it the wrong way :( I miss and love her so much she is the only person who actually understands me and likes me and doesn’t hate me, I’m sad
This girl is not my ex. But she has feelings but I was blinded by my own troubles. Now I have feelings and I like her now but she says she doesn’t like me like that. But when we hang out she’s next to me a lot and hugs me and stuff and I don’t know if she has feelings again. I like her a lot but I don’t know if she feels the same way. :(
This is Perfect, thanks I'm going to try this,
My beautiful ex is away for six months training in the army sooooo i guess the giving her time part is down packed 😂😂😭
Kate Spring Please help me out if/when you can. I wasnt myself for a while. I was under a lot and really loved her. But I didnt show it the way I was suppose to. I was real mean to her and I was so stupid I didnt realize what I was doing until it was too late. I want to show her just how much I really care and how I should've loved her from the beginning. We talked on the phone the other day and she said I cant beg her to to be my girlfriend. I knew this but I couldn't think. But she also said "show me that you deserve a second chance" I dunno if she really meant that because shes ignored me since the call and I'm refraining from texting her. My sis made plans for us to talk this weekend and I dont know how to show her that I deserve a second chance.
Does it work?
I asked her 1 moth later and she said yes thx (:
Can you do the month of no communication at anytime after the break up?
Hey Kate, great advice and technique for text messaging. Can these examples apply to a girl that I was dating for 4 months? ...Background info: Things have been rocky for 4 months, we really like each other’s company but she wanted to end it because I wasn’t being a challenge for her, gave my love and attention to easy, and lack of romance. We agreed to take a break after we had a fight; haven’t had communication for a week. However, this coming Friday we both are supposed to be at the same concert with the original plan in mind that we were going together, no one else of our friends have tickets to go. Even tho you advised 1 month of taking a break, should I reach out to her as the new me or should I wait for her to reach out? .....Note: I have done the steps of reflection, self-improvement and staying busy for my self. I do feel ready.
After our breakup,we use to messaging  regularly.but she says she don't want to be relationship with me. just want to be friend. but i want her back
I had 1 year relationship n that was going very well n we were soo happy with our relationship. But i don't how her feelings faded towards me. And after 1 year she broke up n we are not talking to each other. She blocked me on social but she unblocked me now from every where but we are not talking to each other. She said when i asked that '"Are you happy with this breakup, its easy for you?"  She said no.  Help me what should i do?
Hi, Kate thanks for your suggestions but I'm in fear of her if I didn't text her she will forget me like that. To be Frank I'm in very deeply love with her, I did some mistakes and agreed those mistakes but she can't believe me...we r good since 6 months but now she is thinking past n she is ignoring me but she is also love me lot, she is very angry girl whenever she is angry she won't here me... she is possessive about me n I'm also, if I told that she wl angry without her I'm not Nthg like that I'm in love with her plz suggest me...
Screw my ex are you available?
What if the ex is living in another place because of college , is it possible ?
I breaked up with my girlfriend that same day i regret it i went to begging she didnt want me back she said she didnt wanna date anyone for a long time what do i do?
Will writing her love letters work??
Hey Kate, I've been looking all over for ways to get your ex back when you have a child together and so far I have yet to find legit source material.  I broke up with her in February and things have been hot and cold ever since. I got a new place and noticed she started coming around a bit in a friendly way. Shes very secretive about her personal life right now and shes being alot more friendly but about a month and half ago she purposely facetimed a guy when I came to drop off our daughter and i'm not sure if she did that to make me mad or if shes seriously moved on. I also noticed she was saying a bunch of negative stuff about me on twitter. "Subtweeting" of course and idk if shes confused about her desicion to move on or if she wants me to come back or what. We have broken up in a similar fashion years ago before our daughter when she got with someone new and left him for me. In total we have been off and on for almost 13 years but things just got rough once our daughter was born.  All I know is  ive had 5 months to my self, and that I love her and I miss her and want my family back. I hate only seeing my daughter on the weekends and a few days out the week. She will be two in October. What should I do? I try no contact but its hard because I feel like communication with my daughter is key in this stage of her life.
Me and my girlfriend recently broke up. We unfollowed each other instagram and I unfriended on Facebook. I'm trying the waiting period where I don't contact her. But every day I notice she keeps watching my instagram story even tho she doesn't follow me. Does this mean anything?
Hey Kate. I started a relationship two years ago with my best friend, but she broke up with me because of mistakes I made in the past. I brought my stress of school out on her, I got jealous when she talked/was with other guys, and I got mad at her for reasons I can't even explain. She says she still loves me, and there is a chance we could be together again in the future, and it is what I really want. What should I do? She said she was thinking about breaking up six weeks ago, and I sent her texts,  pictures, and funny videos for the past five weeks, thinking it would help. She broke up with me two days ago. Should I still try no contact? Thanks!
iknow what i have done wrong and I asked a lot if she could give me another chance but what should I do to still get a chance even though she says I know what you want but that is then still 100 times said so it is enough I do not feel like to say the same every day
Whats something else I can use besides a memory or could I use a movie that we watched one night
Well what if my ex wants some time to know me better and she begs me to keep talking to her even though we broke up?(i know that she still loves me and all of that but everything in our relationship hapenned so quick that we had very little time to know each other. I also know that she had no problem with me but she had with herself and only)what should i do?
What's the best way to deal with your ex's over protective close friends they're giving me grief and all and I'm thinking of ways I can start talking to my ex again but they always some how find out we r talking and step in any tips?
Thanks you for teaching me how to do it bc I love some one the most and she special for me and I love her alot

Sigh....
Lmao we started talking like 3 weeks ago but fell off about 3 days ago and I wanna get her back. She just got out of a 10 month relationship and she says she just wants to enjoy life right now and she doesn’t want to be tied down. On everything I just want to give her my love I don’t know what to do...
I don't want my EX back....his uncle is more dangerous then LA gangstas...😂 but I still love her...
Hi Kate, is there any way to speak with you via email? I have a few questions about my situation and I could really use some insight as talking to my friends etc has not really worked for me.
Can this work if you’ve already used it with her before? My relationship with the girl I love was ended mutually about 1 week ago and I already regret it so much. We’ve been dating for 2 years and got back together once already. It seems I’m never able to appreciate her enough until it’s over. I feel so dumb for letting her go. Can this work again??
Will you marry me?
What if she has new boyfirend after the breakup?
But like 2 months ago me and my girl was dating then I broke up with her in early April to go with this other girl cause I had more feelings for the other girl then my girl then the girl broke up with me then I went back to my girl me and my girl been dating for 2 months now she found out a couple days ago that I left her for the other girl so my girl broke up with me last Sunday I’m telling her that I love her and I made a mistake and I should of told her sooner I really want her back 🤧 what do I do ?
i love you kate
I verbally abused my ex after I caught her lying to me on over a 2 year period. I can't be without her but her family tells her to stop talking to me. Am I doomed?
What if she is in another place? I did no contact for two months. She texted me telling me that she finally read an apology letter i sent her for the mistakes from my side. Had two or three texting chat. Now how should i keep it up?
Hi kate, my ex and I broke up because she’s not happy with me anymore tho I always make her happy. You think I can still win her back? She fell out of love

What if she Think that i am a fuck boy. We had several Dates and sex every time. But the last time after hanging out at a lake and taking her home we just cuddled and kissed. I was okay with that but things was getting in one direction. She stopped because she wanted to do things slowly. Later on she wrote me that she thinks that im more into her body than her as a person. Since then she havent answered my texts for two days. Today she replied with "im sorry" im confused because there was no negative thing between us
Crap i should have came to you first...can you help me its been a year since we broke up
Hey Kate, I'm Tristan! I could really use your help. I've moved on from my Ex after we broke up over a month ago and she originally wanted to be friends and I agreed cause I didn't wanna lose her. I begged and pleaded at first but I finally accepted wanting to be her friend and now she's trying to tell me she doesn't wanna be friends. I'm super confused on what to do to show her that I can be a good friend to have. I really still want her in some capacity even if it means we're friends.
Hi Kate,I just broke up wt my ex 3 months ago,well open to say right after break up I'd been sending lot of begging texts even i cried while i was talking on the phone but she said tht she nvr love anymore and she said she hates me but I'm just started the no contact period 2 weeks ago, is there any chance I cn get her back if I put myself busy wt some things and continue no contact period?
Do you think that i can get my ex back after cheating on?
Hey Kate, hope you doing well. But me and my ex & a friend of mine had a dinner together and it went great. I’m just wondering if should I text her after the dinner? And what to say?
Can i date u instead
Kate, I waited 30 days to text my ex gf. I text her yesterday with a fond memory and her reply was really good, but I didn't respond because she didn't ask a question or anything. How long do I wait to text her again?
Hi Kate my girlfriend broke up with me about eight days ago I started the no contact rule for three days.

Hey Kate I just broke up with my ex like 2 days ago.. In 2 weeks we will be in the same consert with the same group of people can I fast forward the whole method and use that as a part of the get her back method?
Hello :), im in 9th grade and my girlfriend broke up with me a week ago.  We dated for 6 months.She said that we argued too much. I was feeling a little insecure for probably the last month of our relationship  because she was always talking to other people instead of me (they were girls not guys). I have started doing no contact and i am having a tough time. She pretends i dont exist anymore and seems to be enjoying her friends. What should I do in this situation?
Man my girl just broke up with me and She fine asl so I think this will work do tall think  this will work cause I love her💖💯
How does the No Contact rule work when you have a child?
Hi Kate I’m on the no contact phase but before this I kind have got super emotional and definitely looked desperate and had met up with her witch started off good then turned to a disaster do you think that the no contact can still work after screwing that up in the beginning
What can I do to get a girlfriend I like someone but I don't know how to say it to her, do I have to right a letter saying if you want to be my girlfriend or do I have to say it in words to her??
What if me and my ex still live together? And we talk every day, we just broke up 2 days ago, and im kinda at a lost.
Hi  does no contact mean not posting anything on social media as well, After she stopped talking to me I was constantly posting on Instagram and Snapchat how I am enjoying my life. Recently she unfollowed me on both the platforms. Meanwhile I didnt contact her anyways. Kindly help me.
Is there a way I️ can call to talk about the situation I️m in and how to get out of I️t? I️ really want my love back she’s the best girl I’ve ever been with
In 30 days she has probably moved in with another guy.
What if your not straight
Hey Kate...i had been away from my ex upto 8 months now and sometimes i tried to call her nd text her but nothing gone right. And i am really crazy for her so please tell me what to do now...should i text her or wait for good time.
My girlfriend and me breakup . I am now working in Africa and she is in India. She said never ever text me and blocked .. what to do ?
If she left you because her brother deny her to talk with you and also told her to matain distance and find someone else when you will out of town for studies? Plz dm!
Hi love the video. But my ex and I have kids together. So a month of no contact will be almost impossible because I do need to be there for our kids and we constantly have to stay in touch. I did how ever have a similar experience a couple days ago with her over texting. I do feel like we connected a bit and I seemed to have at least made her smile or giggle. What would you recommend in my case? 😕
Should i add my ex on snapchat its been 3 months since the break up butwe had interaction before didn't went well
So for the rule that you can't talk for a month. let's say you go to School with you ex and normally sat with her and your friends. What then?
what if you haven't talked to your ex in a month. and all of a sudden she changes her facebook profile picture, to a picture, that i took of her with my band t shirt on?? what the heck is she doing with that as her profile pic??!
cute girl

Hi, my ex-girlfriend is really sad right now. It is mostly my fault. It is 3days that I broke up with her. I an trying to text her because I still really love her. I decided to broke up because I was getting mad at her too much for not texting me. I broke up and I regret my self a lot. I was trying to get her back but that was too late. Her heart is broken and she hates me and she think it is annoying to answer my text. She doesn't even want to text me and date me anymore. What can I seriously do to get her back when she is not answering....? Please tell me the way!
Hi Kate, I followed your steps but no response... Any ideas? 30 days no contact, called and left a simple non attention seeking or needy voice mail and a text asking about location of a yoga class we went to. Within the 30 days I've done a lot of self improvement and am in control of my emotions and mentally on a mother level but I can't stop thinking about her and wanting her in my life. Please help.
ya I want my girl back
I contacted my ex after 2 months of no contact period reminding her of our awesome lunch we had some months back n asked did u remember name of tha resto..she replied the name but didn’t process for further conversation...what should be my next step?help me plz
@ Kate Spring.....Great video, I have been in no contact with my ex for 2 months now after she stopped responding to my text messages. We left off on good terms after arguing about the break up. She lives in another state and met someone there and now is in a relationship with him  for the last 7 months. I was thinking of breaking NC but I don't know if that is a good idea.... Should I wait for her to contact me?
I really need your help. This stuff isn’t really helping me. Me and my ex haven’t been together for 5 months now but we still kept in touch and talked almost everyday. We got into it about something but now we haven’t spoken in two weeks. I want to call her so bad what do I do?
She is in another relationship... And even she don't  want to listen my name....
Hey kate plz help me
So I definitely broke the NC rule in the first 2 weeks after she broke up with me, even sending a "dirty" text to her after she met up with me to take the keys to her apartment which she gave me a copy of. Her reason for the breakup was "mental issues", which I saw none of during our relationship. Since then, I wished her a happy bday, then she wished me a happy bday 3 days later (our bdays are close), and after 3 weeks, I sent her a text saying that my brother's cat reminded me of her cat (her cat is a cat I got her as a gift)... I really miss her, but I'm back on another 2 weeks now of NC... When should I send my next text?
What if the ex lives in a different country ?
I want to write to my ex GF tomorrow which is a bit more than four months after we broke up and since we had contact for the last time. Tomorrow will also be two days after my birthday (where she didn't send me wishes). Should I wait another week in order to make the situation less stresful for her? So that she doesn't feel a pressure or guilt because of my birthday being only two days ago and she not sending wishes.
Great video ! Getting girl advice from a girl is gold
I need help
So I'm friends with my ex, and we been talking but sending a text like I hope we can talk more or talk on the phone  weekend sometime , I get no response and she read it. Just honestly don't know what to do.
My ex broke up with me a week ago today. We met up yesterday to talk and she told me she loved me and missed me but she was unhappy on how things were between us, it sucks but I understand some of the reasons are my fault I could have been a better boyfriend, but I am afraid if I don’t try and contact her she will forget about me and move on, we’ve been dating for a year and a half and I just don’t wanna lose her:(. Advice?
She blocked and i want her back..tgere was no mistake of mine in breakup.His Ex Bf came back she left me
Hey Kate, how can you win your ex back when it's long distance? My ex girlfriend is in Denver studying medicine & I'm in San Francisco building my career. We parted ways due to the stressors of long distance. I'd move there in a heartbeat but it's it's quite difficult to rebuild attraction given thar we're in separate States. Really appreciate your advice here.
How do I do this if I have to see her/talk to her bc of our kid?
Kate how do you handle the no contact for 30 days when you have kids together
I need help
Xbox?
Did someone succed with this? Please i wanna know.

Hey so would this be a good reminder text. I’m trying to get my ex back and I know she loves Mickey Mouse. I bought a really nice Mickey Mouse painting and I was going to send her a picture of it and told her I was thinking about her
Hey Kate, I might be a little too late to watch this video. I kinda already broke that first rule. I didn’t talk to my ex till after a week. But because she texted me. And every time we would text it would be because she wanted to. Except for other times when it was me. But now it’s been almost two months since she broke up with me, but she has also blocked me on everything. What do I do?
Hi Kate, first of all good video Well let me share something and need help, my gf brokeup with me  7months ago, after a rltn of 6years. But now sometimes she text or call me when she get fed up from problems of her life , she share her problem but not briefly, she shares when she seriously get ill, she is still single, no frnds now she has, she feels that she is going mad these days cause nothing special is happening in her life (she brokeup with me, coz she felt that tym also that nothing special is happening in our life, not a successful life).   But u know i always and still love her, but i dont show, but i hardly controlling my love for her, still show concern to her, but now i m confuse what she is doing with me, she don't showing if she again want me, may be she dont want, but den y she talk to me!   Plz suggest, i get hurt when i find her in problems, but get hurt more when i find she wants me or using me for her problems or loneliness.
I broke up with her 5 years ago and she still won't get back with me I SPENT OVER £70 ON HER!!!!!!!!!
Is texting better than in person?
Hey Kate. I really need advice now. I'm done with my 21 days no contact. Have reached out to my ex 4 times since then. She replied the first 2 times and since then she's been ignoring me. She did reply to my tweet a day ago. I texted 4th time an hour after taking a pause of another 7 days. She's online but no reply. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  PS: Absolutely no mistakes like begging and pleading done since breakup. No fight happened during breakup too. It was peaceful. Please help :(
When I click the link to "read more" at the bottom of the transcript, I am being taken to the Ex-factor website of  a Brad Brown. What's up with that?
Hello Kate! Please help me I really need help. My girlfriend and I loved each other a lot we thought we were meant for each other until I fucked it up multiple times. She recently got sick and got annoyed with small things I think it was cause she was sick and we had a fight and she broke up with me. She said she was scared if this kept going it’s gonna affect her health and she wanted to move on. But after week or two before I left the house we were living together in she cried to me and she said she’ll always give me another chance. Here’s the thing right after we broke up she was on tinder. Now don’t get me wrong she was a sick child and due to that she didn’t have a lot of friend so I thought she was looking somebody to talk to. She was chatting with this guy who she said was gay. Then she was talking with him like 12-14 hours a day every second. She said he was just a friend. Then I moved out of her house she hanged out with the guy and he spend nights in her house and we then hanged out in Valentine’s Day and we had a real good time but she was constant texting her. And now they are in relationship, I met her 2 days ago cause I really missed her she said she really fucking like this guy and maybe love him, she also said she’s always gonna give me a chance and she doesn’t know what’s gonna happen in future but I am scared because they really click together and she said she’ll always care for me. !!
Hi Kate, I did the no contract then texted her. She ended up coming over, it was fun light and like our relationship was months ago.  She told me she missed me. We laughed, made out and left on a good note. I'm just worried about how to make the next step... How often should I text her? How long until I invite her over or out again? I'm doing lots of my own things and she knows it and I plan on continuing that. Just worried about how to get to the next step. Thanks Kate
I have a question, i want to show my girl how much i love her,  we are in highschool and have been dating again for about 2 months. Is it complete overkill to buy her a pair of ear rings for valentines day?
How should I aproch her after the month
Awesome adviser you are on dating and relationship! Thumbs up!!👍👍(you look great too)😉
what about if she love me but she's afraid of trusting me?
Hi Kate, I've been texting my ex since we broke up 7 months ago, and yessss she told me I was pushy and intense,  yesterday she send me a text telling me goodbye forever and she blocked me from every social media and phone, The thing is she never broke up with me in person and I just wanted that, see her again, because I've been working on myself going to the gym, new clothes, my question is, what can I do? how can I show her I've changed if I don't have her on any social media or phone? It is too late to make the no contact rule? I would really love a coment about this
Does that apply on a 2nd break up when I have already used it successfully during the first?
What happens is she says someone might take me away from her but doesn't want to talk anymore
The problem I have with the "no contact" rule is my wife and I have an 8yr old that we both have to interact and discuss issues with school work etc.. Also time spent with my son includes seeing my ex as well.. any thoughts..?
What if the relationship is long distance? Like you've moved to a different state after the break up ? Buy you did the 30 days method
Hi Kate. How does this work when you have a child together please? :s
my girlfriend called me after no conctact period now she is asking me costliest gift
Hey kate my ex just wants to be friends now wants nothing to do with me otherwise but i still love her very much and miss her how can i get her back how can i show her that i still love her so much
my girlfriend just broke up with because "we arent connecting anymore" what should i do?
What if she contacted me first and I contacted her back but now no reply?
What if I accidentally looked at her story on instagram from doing all that hard work of avoiding her??
Very very hard to do the no contact...how can I do this?
but what if she started dating someone else during this time.. ??
Great video. Thow my case has no solution....
Question.lets say she left without saying a thing, I begged her to talk to me to atleast tell me why. No answer no reply.i need answers to know if she found someone else or plainly doesn't love me anymore. Should I contact her???? help!
What to do if she texts you BEFORE the one month is over?
What if she text you before 30 days?
Kate: strong eye contact, touch.. Me: touch 😏 Kate: when appropriate Me: ahhh...
I just ended a relationship with girl and a couple days ago, couple days later she moves on with another guy, 2 weeks later she contacts me saying she wants me to work on her car,  is she trying to get back with me? I do regret letting her go and i want to get back with her any advice?

She misses me and I miss her
Well Shit. I Sayd To My Ex Wery Bad Things Now Idk What To Do😥
Sounds good .. But to be honest I don't know what I want ( my ex back or not ) My heads in the shed ☹️
after 1 month of absolutely no contact, you might not even want her back!!
What if i texted my ex girl of 8 months and said "Hi,name i miss you we should talk"(in text)
Hi kate, I am in trouble, my girlfriend is very cold with me nowdays, i asked her to take a break, its been 3 months we did not text, but i wished her birthday or our anniversary, but response was very cold, one i called her she did not pick the call and did not reply my text. What should i do.
Hey. I fucked up NC two times the first month since she left me and then she asked for space to heal. Im now in week three of NC and still no sign of her. She doesnt watch my stories but she hasnt made her instagram private and we are still friends on facebook. She had a complex operation last week but I still didnt contact her. I really wish she will message me on the holidays now, but Im losing hope. Do I still have a chance? We were together 9 months and I really love her.
Great but in real life not possible
I will just cry..
Can you help me get my girlfriend back please! It's only been 3 days but I miss her so much and I told her this and she practically just dismissed it. Ik messaging her that was probably wasn't a good idea but I sent it anyways. Please help!!!
Hey, my ex and I had a long history of getting back together, but soon or later we again break up in couple of months, its been 10days or so then we stopped talking to each other, and I have been thinking about her. Well her exams are going on. I want to send a motivational text to her regarding exams. It's would be okay. If yes can you tell me which text would be great to send. Thanks 👍
if she ask you not to text her ever...then? after no contact..should i text her?
So me and my ex met prior to me leaving for work for a long period. I was going to be away for 2-3mo. While she was there we talked and even gave me a hug, held hands a little and then parted ways. So I am thinking we are on good ground but now it seems as if she is giving me the cold shoulder so I am going to implement the no contact phase for 30 days. Per your advice I hope this works and can at least get us back to talking again.
I kept in contact with my ex for about a month and a half. Can i still apply no contact? Do i still have a chance?
Hey Kate, I have a Question. How long should you build rapport with your ex before you send them the favor text?
Hi, my ex girlfriend broke up with me a few weeks ago and we've been text  a lot since then. We were together for almost 10 years live together for most of those years, and now we live a hour and a half away from each other in a different state and I feel like no contact will just.... I'm real skeptical on the no contact. Any suggestions
I feel like she will find someone else if I do the no contact thing
What if it's been a year
How do I establish no contact if we still live together? Legally married 2 kids

Hi! I love your videos!  what if my ex wife already has a boy friend since she broke up with me?
I hate to say it,  but sometimes when it's over,  it's over you should accept that and move forward.  I spent close to 2500$ on books and relationship counseling.   I finally realized it just isn't going to happen.  And that's okay,  the sun rose today and it'll rise tomorrow.
hey kate, i never officially dated this girl, but we liked eachother but she claimed the two year age difference between us. personally i don’t think that two years is that huge. she claims that she will want to try new thing (hint hint) but my ass is only 13!!!! what do i do
Kate my ex is moving on with another guy should i forget about her and move on
If she messages me in the no contact period, do I reply? Do I leave it on read?
Hi kate, I broke up with my ex 3 years ago but we only stayed together for 3 months, and I was only 16 at the time so we never really did anything fun or memorable. So I cant think of any first text. How would you go about this?
Would it it be too long if you had no contact with her in over a year?
can you help get my girlfriend back
It's been 3 years, I don't know what to say haha
We broke up a week ago.  We dated for 3 years and she broke up with me a week after she was talking about moving in and getting engaged.  It came out of nowhere.  I’ve tried not texting her, but she’ll text me sometimes.  I’ll respond to her but eventually she stops responding.  What should I do
Shit I done no contact wrong! I always watched her stories 🤦🏽‍♂️ frick
Are these text OK to send if she has got a new man?
It's been a month and no contact period is over but the problem is I am blocked from all the social platform . What should I do now;!!!

hello, we have been together for 1,5 year and broke up about 2 weeks ago, but we spent so mutch time together after the brake up, mostly because of me feeling sad alone or she wanted to eat together. I done a lot of mistakes: i was needy, i kissed her and even worse things. We talked so mutch these days and she told me that she feels apathetic to me for at least 3 months and been with me just because didin't wanted to hurt me. But the day i understood how i love her and our relationship is something so special that i never had before she met her ex and now they are dating. I want to do anything i can, no matter how hard it will be to get her back, because i remember how happy she was when she had feelings for me, i want to make her happy again, but dont know how to bring the feelings back. Today I sent her the message asking her to give me some time for recovery. Help me pls, for the last month I cant eat or sleep. sorry for the mistakes, my writing is really bad.
Well fuck. I already texted her with mean texts... 🤦‍♂️
i broke up with my ex and now i regret it she wont take me back after many attemps :(
kate thanks for read my message it's OK to send a bouquet of flower after no contact rule
Hi Kate great video thanks Kate what if I take her a bok of follower after 2month of no contact is the good for me
My ex and I were together for 1.5 years. We were best friends before we started dating. Towards the end of the relationship she decided she was going to move back to her home town. She promised she wouldn't break up with me. But a couple days after she left she broke up with me, and 4 days after that she told me she's with someone new. She still contacts me and flirts with me, I'm not sure how to respond to that. I miss her a ton, and I really want to win back her heart. But I'm not sure where to go about this, please help?
The Rule of Absence is a real thing.  I was with a girl for over a year and a half.   We had a horrible break up, but the chemistry was right or something.    The break up was so bad the absence lasted almost 2 years, but now we are working to get back together.
I had avoided my ex for almost 2 years when she cried and begged to be with me. Now all of a sudden  20 days back she committed to a guy who has left his gf for her and has been asking my gf to marry him for over 2 years. Now I am realizing how much I love her. Can I get her back? Believe me I am apologetic and changed man.
A text with a statement that brings back a fond memory,  that still has a open ended question works the best IMO.
Does it mean something if my ex watches every single snap chat story of mine? Idk if shes just genuinely interested in what im up to. Or if she might miss me...🤷🏼‍♂️
Hey Kate, me and my gf broke up weeks ago and today marked the day of the completion for my NC period. Im gon a used the text examples and text her. During the NC period, she did wished me a happy birthday, despite the fact she blocked my friends in her instagram and went private afterwards. What was even more astounding was we never followed each other's social media platforms during our relationship cause we were so connected thru text messages and late night calls. What causes the break up was i didnt put alot of effort in the r/s but i do love her and its pretty clear why she chose to break up. Well wish me luck!
Does this work on you?
My ex fiancé is the mother of my child, I couldn't do the no contact rule. We text somewhat. What should I do?
hey kate, I've been doing the no contact rule. so by the 25th of the month it will be about 1.5 months. I was thinking of reaching out to her since that day its a holiday and telling her about the song that we both loved and how it reminded me of her. my breakup was pretty bad I was acting out for 2 weeks with pleading aND beggingm but after that I did no contact and during my 2nd week of no contact she texted me to wish me on a holiday although she said she doesn't want to be contacted and ignored my messages before. I igored that message. so is my idea of reaching out like that good?
Hey kate, i contacted my ex again after 1.5 months of no contact telling her about a restaurant which she would really like. I didn't rushed but she kinda seemed annoyed. Is it common or not? And what should i do?
and what if she has blacklisted you everywhere
hi Katie my ex girlfriend blocked me. we broke up last April and we tend to be friends, but when we argue she will block me on the messenger. I think she will never ever care about me anymore because of what happen. please help me.
She says she is dating someone. Should I text her every day or text her good morning and good night? ( she goes out on dates with me too)
Hey! I want your advice! She broke up with me after 10 months because I started caring too much, turns out she only said that because she was messing around with another guy at college and felt guilty. They are together right now but they live across the country, so it won't work out. I have started no contact for about two weeks, but I do want her back eventually. Should I text her the reminder text in a couple weeks or wait til they break up and she tries to come back? Thank you for the help
Good information Kate....  it's going to help me in my relationship
I watch these videos and I sincerely thank you for offering us hope. My ex recently left me because I had a problem drinking. I drank because of our situation. I couldn't take her anywhere. I couldn't help with the bills or put food in the refrigerator. I felt absolutely WORTHLESS. I accepted all her faults but she claims she couldn't understand why I felt the way I did. I didn't even have a decent pair of underclothes to put on. Life is very unkind.
Dear Kate, I really need advise. I'm sending these messages  with fun memories we shared, but she is keep reading my messages and not replying, I'm still blocked on snapchat and whatsapp the only way I can text her is via Facebook Messenger, she is in a relationship right now for 3 weeks, I'm spacing out my texts, but what should I do? she doesn't reply.
Kate, she messaged me asking for me to drop her stuff round, but seems to want to carry on the convosation over text (not being blunt) it's been 3/4 weeks of no contact what shall I do? I'm taking a while to reply (hour or so) and staying happy and positive hinting that I'm busy when she's asking when can I drop round. She wants me to drop when she is in rather than just give to her parents....
hi Kate, me and a girl were briefly in a relationship. We had known each other for over a year nline but only in the same place for two months. We struggled to make it work but I believe it was because I had a lot of other life pressures that did not allow our relationship to be the best it could have been. I only did no contact for about a week but we've hung out since and she seems to be receptive. I feel I've learnt a lot and don't panic about seeing her. Do you think I just go with the flow and continue communicating with her or just go silent again? My goal at the moment is just to work on the "friendship" side of our relationship as I think that was missing before. One of my mistakes was focusing too much on the sex I think.
Hey kate, I appreciate your work,  So my girlfriend broke up with me a year and a half back and now we havent been in touch since, but I know she loved me, and situations got heated up and she broke up,  So how can I text her back?  I reaallly wannt her back Hoping to see a reply soon!  Thanks :)
Dear Kate, Brad Browning sended me here, and these tips are really usefull but will it still work even the breakup was 10 months ago? I can only contact her via Facebook message because she blocked me on snapchat and whatsapp, and I did the no contact for 2 months
I proposed my friend who already know that I like her. I talked with every day.. Someday upto 4am...Last night I proposed her,but she said that if you don't want to ruin our friendship don't say it again...What to do now?
hey Kate I don't talk to my gf for last 1 month but we talk hardly 3-4 time only in no contact time period but she also fight with me last Friday  She said " U use my feeling u don't trust me I give u many chance don't think about i come again relationship with u i never want to be with u in relsnshp again "    That's my mistake I don't trust her many time I fight her for this.i have many times brekup with her but I beg her to save the relationship every time she come but this time I will not beg her I want her back ... like she was in the binning of the relationship
Great video! I subscribed! Maybe come check out my channel and if you like it sub 😊
what if you have a child together? kinda hard to not communicate or avoid with no contact rule...
Hi, well me and my girl broke up yesterday.....and today just begged her.....well i admit it was all my fault i was too possesive, did not trust her enough and sometimes dis-respect her.....she is a bit stubborn and note that we broke up before because of my possesiveness and now again.....what can be done please help!!
Be careful with this, I've tried this method to the tee on my ex and it didn't work. She seemed to be even more distant than before. I think this method only works on normal girls
What if she does not allow me to be silent for a month, contacts me, lets me try some text like this and just does not respond and is quiet for another fortnight or so even though she asked for an advice or so? Thank you for your answer.
Kate my gf has cheated on me and leaves me because she started loving another guy and she didn't loves me anymore and she break up with me what I have to do to get her back to love me ?
what kind of msgs should i send her after 7 monthes of no contact  at all she just saw me one time and she started the conversation  but i was not ready so i ended the conversation  as fast as possible  and i just walked  away.
so my ex hates me and has said to some of my friends that she just wants me to disappear. We have 2 classes together at university. its been 3 months after the breakup and we had a couple fights around month 2 when we were returning processions. do you think that when i first text her i should apologize for things i said following the breakup? she seems really mad and should i extend the no contact period?
