I've used apple or white grape juice with a squeeze of lemon juice; both are delicious! 😊
OMG! So young and handsome! 😄
The best mix in my opinion is equal parts of vacherin, gruyere and appenzeller. Greetings from Switzerland 😊
If I don't wanna use wine what can I add instead
I hope they raised a good amount, this is an ongoing need.
“What’s wrong with you?” “To much wine” Story of my life 😂
Watching people communally dip stuff pre-covid feels so weird.
When my kids were little we fondued at least once a month. Loved it.
Get rid of the music please
Emmenthal bland? Cheap? 🤔Righteo. Things must be very different in the UK
Your all double dipping
Big question do you double dip
A lot of people have gotten rich "raising awareness" for Flint, Michigan's water problem.
The phrase "raising awareness" is a general phrase used by charities that don't do actual ground work.
It's great to support CharityWater, but I learned when I lived in Geneva that you don't drink water with cheese fondue. This is because the oil in the cheese reacts with the water to form a bolus in your stomach; a cheese baby. It makes for an unpleasant evening, and an uncomfortable sleep.   To avoid this, drink plenty of wine with dinner. And finish the meal with an eau de vie (aqua vitae). I like framboise for this, but any strong spirit will do.   Also: for a truly authentic Genevan experience, switch the dipping bread fully for boiled baby potatoes. Even better, add a side of mountain-dried meat. (My fondue guy swears that horse is ideal.) Garnish with some extra sides of pickled gherkins and cocktail onions as respite from the barrage of fat and alcohol.
Am I the only one bothered by their lack of fondue etiquette? You don't dip and eat off of the same fork, that has everyone double dipping in the fondue. You spike your food and dip with one fork and either transfer it to another regular fork or slide it off onto a plate to eat.
Bring this series back!
Obv. fake accents.
Could you make this fougasse using a sourdough starter?
"It's no too cheesy" Can't be too lemony either eh Barry?
How is drinking water gonna help people who don’t have water
Please please add a convert on your site for us that use cups/ounces. Love your recipes but they are a pain to convert
If I don't have Emmental cheese, can I use another??
Dipping anything else than bread into a fondue is not right
I thought Mike didn't like cheese.
Forgotten how much I love Big Night In videos <3
Nice pine cone Jamie.
fondue is one of my favorites i have a big 10 people fondue pot wich i use for cheese and chocolate fondue's
God Jesus save and bless you all amen amen amem
oh please bring back big night in :(
No kirsch?!
How dare you to dump anything else than bread into fondue?  the swiss are watching, and judging
That is sooo not the real swiss style fondue! I’m crying 😭
Cant watch this.... 😜🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭
Is it bad that I just had a 'oooooo his just 5 years older than me' moment when Mike mention 1986?😝
Have u ever had the meat fondue ? With a bunch of difference sauces my parent did
But where is James?
I say use gruyere and Vacherin Fribourgeois cheese, half half
Is there such a thing as a vegan cheese fondue? I am obsessed with cheese but want healthier options.
should the celery, carrot or broccoli cooked before?
Hey great video, im glad you guys brought up how much we take clean water for granted
But doesn’t the alcohol get cooked out?
If you want to go traditionally Swiss, use Vacherin Fribourgeois instead of Emmental and add half a shotglass of Kirsch; we call that a "moitié-moitié" (half and half). If you want to go full punch-in-your-face cheesy, use 3:4 Emmental & aged Appenzell and switch the white wine and Kirsch for dry cider and "Träsch" (Schnaps made from apple and pear pomace). Plain bread, potatoes, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes etc. are fine to dip, but overly flavored breads, extremely crumbly nibbles, marinated pickles etc. are a no-go. Fondue is a very social meal, you shouldn't dip stuff that sheds spices, herbs, seeds etc. or - even worse - leaks flavored oils or brines into the fondue. You shouldn't use bread that is too dense, either. You want a bread with a good gluten structure, so the melted cheese can penetrate the crumb nicely. Pro tip: Real cheese lovers go for the crust at the bottom of the caquelon at the end of the meal. Also a classic: If you haven't got enough fondue, leave a small amount of fondue in the pot, add a few eggs and stir until you have very moist, very cheesy scrambled eggs.
I love it, when you do 4 cl „Kirschwasser“ , Cherryschnaps, to it in the End
I love your faces. Thank you for being so kick ass
you also need pieces of pear, apple or pineapple, ham or swiss dried meat, gurkins and marinated garlic to dip. and do the mixture with Appenzeller and Gruyere.. and last but not least, Kirsch!
I can't sleep so I'm watching Sorted. I just laughed out loud so hard with the "as my Ben" slip. 😜 They're so adorable!💖💖 Loved the mini tantrum! 😂😂😂
You guys aren't practicing proper fondue etiquette. You aren't suppose to put your dipping forks in your mouth. You're supposed to use your dinner fork to slide it onto your plate and then use your dinner fork to eat what you dipped. By sticking the dipping fork into your mouth and then into the pot you are contaminating  the fondue pot with your bacteria.
Wtf. I am offended. Please come to switzerland and I will make a real Fondue for you guys
close but not normal swiss stype. put away the lemon  break is up to the taste of the people eating it we usually go for white... we do not put anything else in but break and an egg at the end but I heared that others do this now too here in switzerland :)  good video...liked it!
Has anyone else noticed that they always choose the picture that is the least flattering for Ben (aka hes pulling a funny face or looking the other way) at the end of every/most videos I find it so funny
Jamie looks so skinny in this
As an American trying to make the Fougasse, how many cups is 500 g of bread flour?
Could you use lemonade as a delicious substitute?
Why must you be shippers people? They are good friends and enjoy working with each other. Another great night in video! Love it. Very surprised Mike enjoyed the fondue lol. My husband would have opted out. Hahaha. 😅
A tip to dont drip or wait until it stops you would actually roll your fork so  it doent drip
You would rub your fondue pot with some garlic then cut it up  and also put it in it
acutally to a fondue swiss style you either drink hot tea or coffee with cherry or williams schnaps
This show would be so much better without the smug little shit with the glasses
I watch this video way more than I should. There's just something about this video that makes me want to watch it as often as I do!
How cute... the two people who made the dish are the derpy ones in the end picture 😂😂😂
One thing needs pointing out... You DO NOT put the fondue fork in your mouth! Remove your dipped bits to a plate, then eat with your silverware. You can get a really nasty burn on your mouth if you use the fondue fork with the hot oil fondue but double dipping in cheese or chocolate is disgusting. Cheese or chocolate is not hot enough to disinfect the fork. It is designed for dipping, not eating.
A part foutre la merde dans le monde les Américains ont vraiment beaucoup à apprendre !
I'm sorry the cause is very honorable but pleas NEVER drink water with fondue ou raclette or any meal that is basically just melted cheese. It is very bad for digestion, you will feel very bloated the next day and it kind of ruin the experience. I would recomend wine, more specifically rosé but red wine is totally fine too, tea or coke because the caffeine in it is good for that kind of food.
Swiss fondue never use lemon. That’s a nononononono
You can use apple or grape juice, as long as it’s not too sweet... or non-alcoholic wine, which is mostly unsweetened grape juice...
At 7:12 -7:13 we find out that Ben is Mike's father. The secret is out
At 3:55, Ben admits his secret!!!!
today's my birthday and what I did for my birthday dinner was make beer cheese fondue and turned out really good! I made a lot and I shared some with my parents of course.
2 glasses, 500ml of wine? Just how large are your wine glasses?
its interesting that ben doesn't know the difference between lime and lemon... everytime
I have a strange question: does the achohol get cooked off of the wine?
I definitely have to make that onion bread, should be delicious!
I'm only half Swiss but using vegetable stock and lemon as an alternative to the wine and kirsch made me cringe... that's not fondue that's just cheese soup... and adding lemon juice is disgusting... also them just drinking water probably had them constipated for an entire week... like please stop...
Whoever decorated the room/table is creative and genius!!
you idiots...That is Not Fondue...!
DONT USE EMMENTAL, USE JARLSBERG. AHHHHH
a non alcoholic cheesefondue can also be made by sour apple juice. so apple juice witout extra sucher or sweetner added.
well when you bake wine or anything with alcohol in it the flavor of the drink stays but the alcohol goes away.
I am missing the Kirsch 🤔
That makes Mike 31 this year :]
#BIKE
Half of my family is Swiss, and this looks amazing! (Almost) like the fondue my grandma makes, because she, like lots of people in Switzerland, buys her fondue cheese in a bag from the supermarket, mixed up already. In terms of stuff to dip, what she recommends is actually pineapple, because the acids make it easier to digest all the cheese and bread.
i love you guys i subbed you are all so funny and cute
ผมติดตามไห้แววนา
My family makes it with just gruyere and it's delicious
"Add a little pinch of sugar" *adds a whole tablespoon* -Ben
How do these guys only have 1.7 mil subs????
* adds a heaping spoonful * "just add a PINCH of sugar..." Loool
It was my understanding that for the bread, you needed two consecutive lines in the middle? (GBBO does not lie)
CUTE GUYS LOVE YOUR SHOW ARE YOU ALL GAY
The fougass was in the wrong shape I can't remember exactly but it's name has something to do with nature so it's supposed 2 look like a leaf 🍃
I love fondue! I love eating it with olive bread potatoes and olives (I love olives with a passion I blame the Greek in me)
"eat your sprouts" napkins give pretty decent advice, who knew ...
Now with this recipe, I'm curious to know if the texture of the bread would change if you had spritzed the bread with water and baked it with a shallow pan of water on the bottom of the oven much like you would with french bread. Would it taste the same? Different? Would it change it for the good or the bad?
Would a dry, sharp white grape juice work?
Bake off did that bread
Best fondue I've ever had: smoked gouda and cheddar with hard apple cider and hennessy. Holy. Fucking. Shit.
can we please talk about the eat yer sprouts napkins? they're hilarious😂
Haha I lived in France for a year and Gruyere is pretty much the most basic cheese available and is considered almost completely tasteless XD
3:48 SO FREAKING ADORABLE!!! Damn it Ben!! Stop it!!
the candle holders are the same as the cups they used for the masala chai for tea three ways. tricky sorted, trying to trick us with the ol' candle/teacup switcheroo
Can you do it with Milk
Oi, cold water and fondue is just a stomach ache in the making
Four guys and a pot fondue seems awful gay to me.
The only cheese I like is mozzarella cheese so can you use that?
You guys are the epitome of cuteness :)
Can you use alcohol free white wine?
ummm is anyone else gonna comment on the adorable face Ben made when he had too much wine?!?! SO CUTE!
the background music that played while they were preparing the bread reminded me of the sims
How do you store quails egg?
Fondue For Two! Fondue For Two! That's some hot dish! Fondue For Two!
traditionally you dip in bread, not veggies, but I imagine, that veggies must be tasty too ;)
Make a chocolate fondue it would be nice...
hi can i replace wine with vinegar or rice vinegar ?
Can you make a meal which is halal and Muslim friendly!!!
!!!$$$
ya!!!!!
omg Mike is not 30.....
Can you dip bacon in that cheese
Question for people who know about this sort of thing: I've recently found masked with an abundance of both white wine and camembert cheese. Can I use Camembert for this kind of thing? Or is this sacrilege? Please advise!
Poor Barry 😂
Would white vinegar do the whine's job??? Cause its acidey liquid i guss!!!! And ceep up the good work you guys make the youtube a better place to spend time in...!
Bought a charity: water bracelet such a good cause!
Every year we do the three fondue types for New Years Eve with the kids.  They have so much fun.
you stole the recipe from Allrecipes channel... :(
i like all your recipes!!!!
Now I know what Italiens feel when you cut spaghetti ... :P
copy of julias recipe
Cmon we all know Mike doesn't like cheese
Why isn't Captain America here? He is about to go against Ironman so make him happy and invite him over next time
I'm gonna do this and have a fondue night!!
'Clumping together'  bens was so cute 😍😘😘
As a swiss national with a sri lankan dad, he's brougth fondue to another level adding chopped chili pepers, quartered cherry tomtatoes ( not too many or the fondue gets all soggy and gross) and green peppercons. Cheesy, spicey, yeah just good =)
For variants try adding "1 Stamperl Kirschwasser oder Himbergeist", which is basicly one shot of cherry or raspberry brandy. Also you can go more cracy on the cheese selection, i have at least 3 types of cheese in there. I'd prefer this without lemonjuice in the cheese, but a white whine to drink.
Gruyère and Vacherin Fribougeois is a traditional 50/50 combo and it is one of my favorites but the important thing is to use cheese that YOU like ! It's one of the best meals to have with your mates.
For the wine again, Would non alcoholic wine work? I would like to create this for my family (Very large portions) but some of my relatives are much younger and would enjoy this party food. Otherwise I guess I can try the variant of Vegetable stock and lemon juice.
Every time Barry say this bread is banging....I always think of two bread banging
The chocolate special video is amazing, but.. what abput cheese special video? that would be amazing :O
I noticed that Barry had a pinecone on his fondue stick at the end xD
easier way to peel quailegg is to soak those in vinegar for 20 minutes or so. it will soften up the shell and u wont break the egg so easily cuz its so fragile egg when its softboiled..
I only use wine and gruyere cheese for the fondue but this recipe looks awesome
Ben's "too much wine" face is SO ADORBS!!
"Have a stab and have a dip" Sounds like the recipe for a murder. You need to dump the person you've stabbed in a pool
What we do in Switzerland for an alcohol free fondue (ie. for kids), is using apple juice instead of white wine!
could you please make vegeterian lasagne? p.s. you're all awesome
normaly you put good bread in the cheese, i know what i'm talking about, i'm swiss :)
I just love you guys!
I need this. So bad
water shouldn't be drunk with fondue as it expands the cheese in the stomach - swiss say fizzy drinks is the best drink as it doesn't affect the cheese is the stomach xxx
omg ! yes!
You're a wizard, Barry! 4:27
Please teach us how to make sourdough!
where is the kirsch!?!? No good fondue is without kirsch!
how do you spell the bread name......!
The only thing warmer than that Fondue is the love between the crew...
the cheese fondue i make is just a block of american cheese, pimentos, flour, packet of dry onion, milk and butter blend it up. very simple but so yummy
So, do you two....fondue?  #AncientCaptainAmericaReference #BehindTheTimes hahaha
"so do you two..fondue?"   xD idk how many people got that reference
here's one of my favourite recipe EVER!!!
I think there should be a drinking game where the player(s) have to take a shot every time Ben says "It's the epitome of-" :D
Have one problem to kids eat this??
Am I the only person here who is a child using my dads account?
I'm Swiss and I have to say that this is a really fancy and probably also delicious recipe, however we really don't do that many things for fondue, like we use super basic bread and nothing else for dunking it in the cheese and also, we always use wine since the alcohol evaporates during the cooking process, so it's really much simpler than you did it ;) just garlic, white wine, corn starch, kirsch, and of course cheese :) the bread you made looked really good though!
It's really great the guys talked about water charity, but drinking cold water while eating cheese means the cheese will harden very quickly in your stomach, and you'll get stomachache, so if you ever get a chance at fondue, it's highly recommanded to drink something hot.
The traditional blend is half gruyère, half vacherin. And the classic drink to go with Fondue is black tea. Just sayin' ;)
I *REALLY* WISH I WAS THE FAT GUY IN EVERY EPISODE COS HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING AND THE FOOD LOOKS FUCKING TASTY!!!!!!
i am going to make this for xmas small party with my friends!!!!
When Mike got irritated & said "I'm not donating to anything."😂 he is only 10 years older than me.😏
I live in Switzerland and have never seen a Swiss person make fondue like that! (but love you guys :) ) Add the cornflour to the wine and let it thicken and you need more garlic and nutmeg. Also sometimes Kirche although optional. Also only dip bread in the fondue so it doesn't mess up the cheese! <3
There's the Christmas sweater missing from next week's ep!!! Why are you messing with the order of things, Barry?
My parents did the same with my brother who was also born in 1986. It's okay, Mike. Guess it was a trend that year.
mmmm yummy ^_^ nice recipe. Thank you guys
If i use beer, what kind of beers do you recommend? Dark beers, light beers, does it depend on what you like, is it dependent on cheese pairings?
lel
Thank you!  Charity: Water has been one of my favorite charities for well over a decade.  Even the smallest donation can help improve our world.  Clean water means less costs for health and more opportunities for education for kids.  Better education means an improved village, better opportunities for employment, and more wells to keep the cycle going!
Jamie, regardless of how good the fondue may be, pinecones are not for eating.
Is there an alternative for alcohol?
hello dad I'm ben
I just have to point out Ben's amazing smolder at 3:56. You're welcome :D
Just saw an Ad for sorted food on this vid o.O I have never been so confused until I realised aha
the face ben makes when he says too much wine makes me want to squish it (his face, not the wine)
Whoa that's so cool. At frat at my school does a charity ball with charity : water. :)
Now i want some cheese.
Personally, I prefer moitié-moitié, which is gruyère and vacherin. Also, what would a Swiss stylr fondue be without the Kirsch? 😏
Is this alcoholic c
The look on Ben's face when he said "Too much wine" to me read "I need more wine"
Has Ben still been cooking with one hand in his pockets at all times
I like type of episodes, where they are longer because there are two items in the recipe. The shorter ones just end too quickly.
Traditionally you'd use pain paysan (white bread but with a really tough crust), potatoes and pretty much nothing else to dip, but I have to say I like this version better.
I'm swiss and I do my fondue very differently and I don't like emmentaler and gruyere together, my favorite mix is gruyere and Vacherin :)
This looks tasty. But who has the Patience to peel quails eggs
i'm swiss and... only bread please! It's not raclette.
Why was Jamie holding a pinecone at the ending screen?
i'm so hungry now
A classic dipping food item here in Switzerland is pickles! YEA! Pickles! It is awesome! In Valais they use horse meat, but im not a huge fan though
Ben's face in the photo...
What do you do with the leftover fondue? Do you mix in mashed potatoes and make it into croquettes? ohh! Do a "What to do with leftovers!" episode! With the holiday season, there is going to be soo much of food leftover. Ohh! a leftover microwave dinner episode so that we could just make a bunch of new stuff with the leftovers and then portion them out, freeze them and have them on days when you just don't want to cook! Happy holidays to you 12! Ben you are amazing and I've learnt so much for you these past few years! Cheerios xoxo
So... Do you guys... Do you fondue?
Am I the only human in the world that doesn't like cheese?
This recipe is killing me... I have recently been diagnosed at Lactose Intolerant and yet I love dairy food and food with dairy ie. Fondue. Can you come up with some recipes (in particular deserts) that have no dairy and yet taste amazing
has anyone noticed that Even has looked the same for 5 years
I love Barry in his little christmas jumper, just saying.
You guys should have made a Project for Awesome video for Charity Water. You would have reached a much larger audience that way.
did barry get a baby or fall in love? he does look more mature in the recent videos comparing to the old ones (and I like it!)
when ever I watch your video and if my 3 year old boy heard any one of you voice he come running to watch it and waited to say sorted with you all...... loudly :)
You can also use apple cider instead of wine... yummy <3
petition to start calling all dads ben!!! oh tyrone should be the only one allowed to call ben ben and everyone else should call him dad... yeah :D
watching these videos and laughing so hard i cry because its stupid o'clock in the morning and i can't sleep is definitely not the worst idea I've had!
i love the incorporation of water (the charity) into this video!!
Y'all are awesome! I am an old lady and could just scoop y'all up and adopt you as my grandsons! I love your joy and creativity! I have added several Sorted recipes to my cookbook!
Ben's definitive "too much wine" response was hilarious!
Ben, the bread you used seemed interesting. is there a difference in the flour europe uses ; compared to the U.S. for slighty gluten sensitive individuals?
I approve of the CharityWater! Might I suggest that you get yourself involved with Project for Awesome next year? It'll get your charity more exposure and well known, it's a wonderful campaign and I encourage you all to donate. DFTBA
Might this be Sorted's Project for Awesome video?
Cheese. The only thing I'd marry besides a single Ryan Reynolds.
HEY GUYS IS THERE ANY REPLACE FOR ALCOHOL IN COOKING. BECAUSE I'M ALERGIC IN CONSUMINGALCOHOL
When we do Fondue at my house we always add a bit of Kirsch Schnaps into the melted cheese before serving it.   Another great "Fondue" version is japanese Fondue that is made with broth. You use little baskets to cook vegetables and meat in the broth. Delicious. Plus, you have a very rich broth as left over.
I'm loving the recipe and the charity thought but just to get the most out of it you should thoroughly coat your things to dippy-dip by stirring them instead of just dunking them.. As a Swiss I could only recommend this :) but other than that you did great! :)
oh no.. i opened my mouth wide when watched this video >.<
Yeah I made that mistake when I had fondue... got really thirsty from all the salty food, drank a crap load of cold beverage and ended up with A LOT of pain after as the cheese solidified in my gut.
love you guys! but you should really come to switzerland now to have it proper style ! ;)
Why is sortedfood.com always down? Everytime I try to open the page, it just never loads, and its been like that for months :(
So lovely to hear that you guys have teamed up with a charity
'my ben' no, mike. *claws come out* MY ben.  (but at the same time #ebberstone til death so my feelings are very conflicted rn)
OHMYGOD BENS FACE WHEN HE SAID 'TOO MUCH WINE' IS THE CUTEST THING IVE SEEN IN MY EXISTENCE
Why does it look like he has a pine cone on his skewer in the last frame?
Better get my Christmas jumper ready for next week's video XD
Cheese fondue is really good with fruit and even twinkles....don't judge me.
More cheese more cheese!! I love when Ben says this <3 And his face when he says quail eggs wrong, so cute <3
what a nice idea, definatly going to do this with friends
I thought it was traditional to have cherry schnapps in fondue.
I was told you have to drink wine while eating fondue or else you'd get really bad indigestion!
Can I use water instead of wine? I want to increase awareness for the less fortunate.
Here in Sweden you can buy something called "food wine" thats basically non alcoholic (usually 0.something) its not a sweet wine, wouldn't that be a good thing to use instead of wine with alcohol in it or stock?
can you do a gluten free recipe thank you and keep up with the good work
Did jamie have a pine cone on the end of his skewer at the end??
I'm swiss and I approve of this recipe! :D  I recommend drinking hot tea while eating fondue, it helps digest the heavy cheese.
+SORTED Food HEY GUYS! I have a challenge for you, make a pavlova with any twist that ben can come up with and make it without using a mixer or any kind!
Looks great! next time try chunks of pickle with the fondue :3
For a minute, I thought that this video was going to be for the P4A that's going on now.
Did you even dip the bread in the fondue? Which is the traditional way to eat Swiss fondue...
I've noticed that for a few "big night in" videos now that every time a group question is asked, up to 3 of the guys answer the question. i would have liked to know what jamie would have donated to raise awareness.
Could one use apple juice, instead of vegetable stock, sticking with the fruity theme? Seems to me like it would work.
ben's face at 3:56 freakin' kiiilllllssss meeeee.
Great Vid!
usaly with my family we perposly nock what's ever on the fork off and everybody goes for it in a fork fight it's fun and crazy
Ben, please make your sweatshirt drawstrings longer. It is bothering the heck out of me
XD Mike if ever I've heard a Freudian slip, 'my Ben' has to be the best. I'm not the only one who desperately wants Ben & Mike to be a couple am I? Or have I crossed into the dark side of the Sorted fandom?...
At the end, WHY DOES JAIME HAVE A PINECONE ON THE STICK?!?! hahahaha
In 1986 my parents gave my brother the same name as my dad. The toll company likes to put charges onto my bros account when dads credit card expires. They worked for the same company and my bro got all dads pay for a while. They got to swap plane tickets once. It all balances out.
FINALLY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A FONDUE RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!
Seriously though the guys need too cook a full course meal for Ben again. Except really go all out this time
Mike is 29. I'm 18. It only makes sense.
I always wanted to try fondue, but I live in a hot country. :(
Every bit of that is wrong... EVERY BIT.
You guys should make Challah!
Oh men no! Swiss fondue is way more basic! Crispy baguette and no other dippers, cheese is a mixture of gruyère and fribourg's vacherin with a glass of white Wine and a dash of nutmeg. If you want to get fancy you change the taste of the cheese by adding truffle oil, tomato sauce or sliced mushrooms. Never dip with other stuff than crispy bread. And never drink cold water but always hot tea because the cold temperature of water can agglomerate the cheese and create a tough ball of it in your stomach, therefore it makes it almost impossible to digest!  All of this, from a Swiss viewer, with love you guys ❤️😘
mmmmm
everything taste better with cheese, please try something Colombian like empanadas vallunas or arepa de huevo or so
Fondue for four!
okay im REALLY drunk rn but i love sorted and ben is really really cute is he straight i know that is really irrelevent but ive always wondered anyway hes realy good looking and talented
HOLY SHIT, #BIKE IS REAL. #ShipBike #Ebberstone 😂
In the outro shot when everyone has food on their fondue fork except Jamie, it reminded me of the scene in Ice Age where Sid the Sloth ate a pinecone to avoid getting killed by rhinos. Coincidence? I think not...
I just can't stop watching this... came back from tumblr..😍😍😍
You also need Kirsch!
Can we dip cooked meat into cheese fondue? Maybe some grilled chicken or lamb. Is that unusual to do?
You boys... great friendship goals!
Can i mix the caramelised onions & rosemary into the dry flour I mean before it becomes a dough?
Guys, I LOVE that this series is weekly. So many big meal ideas to choose from! Keep it up! ☺
Isn't that bread recipe the same as focaccia?
one thing I would like to see is a good Stew or Chowder.  in the winter these are some of my favorite foods but finding a good Easy one that is just a bit different is hard.  I live in Arizona State USA.  cheap meat is even harder to find
Hey! You said that you used emmental and gruyere in your cheese fondue but I wonder what other combination of cheese could i use or if the combination doesnt really matter. Fondue is not really a thing here in my country but I'd like to try this for christmas. :D
Chocolate fondue with fruit and/or marshmallows (Y) Is that still fondue, or just like a stationary chocolate fountain?
Could you use like grapefruit juice or something? Because that definitely had the acidity and it's not very sweet at all..?
I'm allergic to corn flour, with what other thing can i substitute it?
best fondue is with gruyere and vacherin. thats the real deal. hint from switzerland :) or you can do an appenzeller one. neeeeevvveeeer use emmentaler! it has zero flavour! and we do use cornflour to stabilize. aaaaand whts great is to add a shot of cherry liquor (kirsch) for flavour.
Because my dad does not eat cheese we  used to do oil fondues when I was little. (70's child here) Loved it. Meatballs and breaded mushrooms were my favourite!
You should add Vacherin  to the fondue! I feel like it gives it that authentic fondue flavour.. And you need to add a whole lot more garlic and Kirsch in it :P the garlic bits are the best part :O
my last names is quayle
Thanks for answering my question!! :))
Drunk Ben couldn't say Quail Egg? Merry Christmas everyone!
If you've got roast potatoes, why would you have any other sort of potato?
That looks very good!
Delicious!! Might try this with friends next week!
Awesome that you are supporting Charity Water! I will donate for my fam too. Also love fondue, can't wait to try this! "Too much wine" hehe.
It's awesome to see you guys team up with C:W! My favorite charity! : )
Vietnam or Thai style hot pot will be a perfect big night in :) you guys should do that
I'm Swiss and we sometimes put applejuice in the fondue, instead of wine, if you don't want any alcohol in there ;)
"My Ben" aaaaaWWWWWWWW OKAY
Posted the same day as the 2015 Project for Awesome.   Great Charity to support.
Can I just like hire you guys as my personal chefs???
I went to a fondue restaurant for my mom's birthday earlier this year. It was the greatest experience of my life. They have a stove burner in the center of the table and made the fondue right in front of you. I've literally never been happier than I was when I was sitting at that table.
That bread looked really really good.
Bless you guys for teaming up with Charity Water. I personally know what it's like to live without access to naturally clean water, so really, thank you for helping these people.
Hang on hang on. An advert for Charity water then recommend people to run their water for 1 minute. really?
OMG Barry! Don't leave Ben hanging like that :(
You are adding the onions before or after the dough has proven? Nice video ! Big night in - Makes every Friday , better! ❤️
For those who may feel it'll be a hard dish to digest, you can add half a tea spoon of sodium bicarbonate. You won't feel the difference when you eat it but it makes digesting it much easier on your stomach.
Can we PLEASE talk about ADORABEN on 3:55??? <3 <3  Love my little quichey.
What could I use for an alternative to wine because we cant drink it in our house
BEN WHERE IS YOUR CHEFS JACKET you're like naked I'm terrified
When Ben said "boiled quail eggs" i covered my baby quails ears... :(
Please turn the background music down a tad
Just to add something to the "why use alcohol" question, there's certain flavour and aroma compounds that can't dissolve into water or fat, but do dissolve into alcohol.
I WANT THIS
why do you have plates?
Nice recipie bit in the east of switzerland we make our fondue quite different. The beld of cheese is up to the individual but in the east emmental is rare... My family uses a mix of appenzeller and vachrain. We do not only use the wine but also kirsch to cook the fondue. In the east most people also only dipp bread... but thats also optional :)
Hahahahha 😂😂😂 mike gets me every single time!! 😂😂😂
that was a nice chat... but now every time i see ben and barry .... all i can think of is the "HONEY" moment XD
Ben's face in the end picture... mid-speech maybe? XD
"...and called me by the exact same name as my Ben" Wait! Ben = Dad? *gasp* Is Mike's middle name Tyrone?!?!
not drinking alcohol with food but using it in food aren't same?
you guys even answered our question about Mike's middle name! im so happy today <3
ahhhh drooling! i love fondue
Fancy nachos and chips
Do a wham bar recipe
this cheese fondue video is cheesy indeed! "my ben" ❤
Is there a good substitute for the alcohol for those of us who can't cook with alcohol?
Could have been a P4A-video ^_^ Just sayin'.
Is Jamie going to dip a pine cone in the fondue? (End picture)
We all have that one person don't we in this case it's Jamie. All this lovely food to dip in the fondu and he picks a tomato...😒😂
Ben I'm disapointed in you. Basic thing when eating fondue is to swirl around the cheese with what ever you are dipping into it. it keeps the cheese moving so the burner underneath wont burn the cheese at the bottom of the pot. And you shouldn't straight away eat from the stick you are using for dipping to keep other people's saliva out from the whole pot. Step it up will you
Aw cute 'Bike' 😘
A squeeze of a yellow lime!
As a French I'm quite a fan of fondue. Since you must keep it warm (often with a flame )in the end ,you're left with a brown/golden chese at the bottom. Then you must crack an egg in it ,let it cook a bit.....and it's heaven ^^
oh Lord, the pinecone at the end! I'm laughing so hard!
LOL the pinecone at the end
when we eat fondue at home, we aren't allowed to put our dipping fork in our mouths. So we have a fork to dip and a fork to eat. (I don't know if this is traditional or just for hygienic reasons)
I can almost taste this maybe if I lick the screen I could taste it xx
So Ben is Mike's father?
Tasty pine cone, Jamie?
What I'd LOVE to know is how the hell they manage stay fit after all the cholesterol inducing foods Ben cooks for 'em!
It's like you guys knew I was craving fondue!! Thanks for this, guys!
*Waiting for the "Fondue for Two" references....* MAN!
The Swiss would never drink cold water with fondue... it is said to make the cheese re-solidify. Wine or tea only!
I just wasted 7 minutes of my life watching guys melt cheese
It's nice to see u guys team up with Charity Water
A pot of melting cheese and savoury rosemary bread = BLISS
"..the same name as my Ben" awww your Ben ^^ great slip of the tongue!
Always have to love fondue, in the colder months especially.
It's 2.19am and now I'm hungry. Bad choice to watch Sorted before bed. Excuse me while I head to the fridge...
it really is the return of Mike's knitted jumpers
K every swiss person is gonna be pissed bc you don't dip any other shit than bread in fondue geez

You should have called it fundue
Earlyyyyyy!
Need to make this for my college christmas party for sure!!!
Fondue pinecones?
"as my Ben" the BenxMike community on tumblr are going to have a field day!
I think it's great that you've teamed up with Charity water because there are so many people all over the world who don't have access to clean safe water, it's a basic human right!  Also, Note to self: Don't watch Fondue Recipe Videos whilst on a diet 😲😂
yummmyyy
It may just be the context, but Ben very well may be the only person in the world who can say "stab" in a completely inconspicuous way.
😍😍😍🇬🇧
This probably isn't the recipe for me. I hate cheese...  Meat fondue tho 👌
I'm in school currently craving fondue
that looks SO GOOD
holy im early wow
