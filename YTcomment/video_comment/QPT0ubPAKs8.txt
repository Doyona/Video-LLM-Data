Hello Gerry.  If you do not have existing pipework going to the fireplace, and the hot water cylinder is on the other side of the house, can you bring the pipes from the cylinder through the attic, and route them down the chimney chamber?  Or is this not possible?  There would be a radiator in the same room?
Is it difficult to remove the fire place and reattach?
Tread the same as sprinkler pipes
Have you made the elbow behind the plate fixed non moving to avoid it moving or expanding backward causing spillage??

What stops it boiling off the water?
My boiler stove was connected to the radiators in a section of the house and also the water supply.  A plumber came out whilst away and I am not sure what he has done.  The log burner (charnwood country 14b) fires up the radiators assisted by a pump but no longer heats up the water.  I am ok with this if it is safe to use.  Is it safe or do I need to do something?
Sooooo apparently our all knowing Environmental Protection Agency does not allow stoves like this to be sold in the good old USA😡 🤪 not clean enough for our government🤔🤪🇺🇸 HOPE YOUR EYE IS OK BUDDY.....
