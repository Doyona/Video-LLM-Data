I really love your pad Thai recipe.its amazing ❤❤thx .
She seems like she knows what she's doing.
Awesome
I followed and it came out tasty!
Ive been to thailand and this is authentic you can taste the fish sauce which is good however here in america the taste is very generic and accustomed to american palate which is too sweet for me.
😊🦐😊😊😊
no, no, no
You made it much simpler than others.
Again another successful recipe! Just made this and it’s soooo good!❤❤ thank you!
Good  delicious  one
I’m try to make this. It was really good but the noodles     was wet and stick together.
Very tasty recipe, Thank you so much ❤
after reading comments i think im gonna try this one🙏😊
Very aesthetic ❤❤❤❤
you look like song hye kyo
Can I have a full name of the black sauce Tamico..?
What can I use as a substitute for fish sauce in this recipe (along with the measurements)?
Looks really delicious mmmmmmm
god i love her! super beautiful, great recipes, great personality!  dude is truly lucky.
I'm giving it a try tonight - looks delicious!
Oh my gosh!  Looks so good.  Plating too. Thank you 🙏
I cannot find and or don't have tamarind  in my town. I live in Alaska what can I do to substitute the tamarind?
Let's digging.....!!🤩💋
Looks so delicious! Thank you for the video. 😊

Thank you for the great recipe!!! You're so cute, too❤
Excellent PadThai❤
When it comes in serving, what is the size for serving? Please reply, I want to use it.. hehe
OMG just made it and it feels like I'm in Thailand again! The smell and the taste were exactly the same as I used to have in Thailand, im so happy!!! Thank u so much ❤❤❤❤
ใช่แล้วค่ะผัดไทยที่แท้จริงต้องทำแบบนี้ ขอบคุณที่ช่วยเผยแพร่อาหารของเรา
I was able to find everything but the radishes and also could not find the substitute. Should I just leave out or is there something else I can do??
accurate and super good recipe! I"ve been sending these videos to my sister who wants to learn wok cooking! thank you!!!!
Thank you so much for this recipe ❤ you explained really very well...love this recipe and thank you
This is the way.
Love your accent ! I'm Malaysian and will try this recipe, thanks 😊
혹시 부모님들 성이 최랑 장이신가요? 이름이 최장선경일것 같네요 ㅎㅎ
She looked ugly while eating...
Wow Perfect ❤️
you are so beautiful!
Great job!!!  You are terrific! I prefer Thai tamarind and I add a bit of peanut butter to the sauce. Have you ever done that?
I am not thais , I am a little bit Chinese, a bit Cambodian, a bit Vietnamese and Canadian. But I know which channels is good pad Thai and which is not 👍
I've cooked Pad Thai following your recipe since last 2 years and it's really yummy. Thank you for sharing 🥰👍
Wow what an amazing cook!! You have soo much skill and very knowledgeable
谢谢你的分享
must try
If ur join with us we make money 💰 in teaching of cooking course...& coming generations of young people
The original Pad Thai never have chicken.
Awesome recipes👌🙏👍
Looks great 👍
i like the way you cook pad tai,looks very yummy.i want to cook this way very easy..
i have some dried radish but its not sweet can i use that? or is there any procedure of radish to make it sweet? thank you so much ❤️
Looks great. I love making Phad Thai. The pickled diakon radish is a must have. Ketchup is a no no. Omg. That's always the first question I ask a Thai restaurant. If they use ketchup, I'm outta there.
I'm Thai. Sriraja sauce is a dipping sauce in Thai foods, but not used in the Thai cooking. However I appreciate her when she put Sriraja sauce and said "It is optional".  I can say that she is one of a few non-Thais who can cook Pad Thai very well.
Real Thai  recipe.
Thanku for the lovely recipe
Had Thai bad for first time tasted like miracle whip and ketchup. I liked the green curry
Yum!
Huh.   No cilantro.
This is way more authentic pad thai than Rachel Ray version. Btw, come here bcoz of Uncle Roger video. 😅😂
no soya sauce?
Thank you!
This is real Pad Thai recipe!!!
I'm from Egypt and I'm making a book about authentic food recipes. If I removed the bean sprouts from pat thai and replaced the chives with green onions and used the noodles you made but cut thinner, would it be an authentic pad thai recipe?
Are bean sprouts an optional addition?
Am straving,hmmm,,it is amazing recipe,,,ilove your channel.thank you
Can i use fresh Rice noodles ?
And that is a very Lucky Man!!!
Careful dear, the way you stuff a clump of noodles into your mouth scares me. I fear, you'll choke.
I have been making a crummy version of Phad Thai for 20 years. Catsup,. Need to shop for ingredients
phóng uế
I literally kept my local thai shop in business in winter as I ordered pad thai daily, now I have no money and have to make it myself :)  This recipe looks delicious, will have to try.
I am a Thai admiring your way of making PhadThai.
Lose the tofu thing, it has no taste and has just been made popular from some fake fad type thing for idiots to fall for . It's like rubber or something,umm,umm.
Making this tomorrow, thank you Seonkyoung!
The shrimp and chicken is RAW u didnt cook it properly 😭😭😭😭
Looks so good
Autentic Pad Thai. Recommend >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti9p5rvNET8
Nice and easy recipe, i love pad thai as well
👍👍
I went so well till the egg and then my noodles started burning before the eggs were halfway done. I just started mixing and continuing. Still tastes good 😊
Your pad Thai looks the real pad thai. As a Thai, I can see the best pad thai ever (prepared by a foreigner.)
*NUDERS*
She is so beautiful
I don't know if this is my favorite noodle recipe or if your Soy Wasabi Spaghetti recipe is. You are the best!
Lovely recipe! Don’t forget kids, sack off your non stick pan/wok after about a year of good usage.
She looks like Lee Hyori!
looks amazing. I love pad thai from local Chinese restaurants l
This man has taken an asian woman from our community
Most pad thai recipes on YouTube use far too much sugar, so kudos to you for going easy on the sugar.
Hmmmm... I wanna try it in my kitchen❤️❤️
I'm trying it tonight for dinner for the first time. Lord, help me!!
no dried shrimp???
https://youtube.com/shorts/mvBs2WYpNJY?feature=share
Superb 👌👌
Shes so sweet 💖 love how she says “noodles”
I love how you say noodles :)
Thank you for this amazing recipe! I made only a few changes but only because I'm vegan. Instead of chicken, shrimp and tofu I did mixed vegetables and I used a vegan fish sauce replacement.  Still tasted wonderful!! Thanks again for all the time you put in to sharing this with us.
Almost perfect!! Only a small pice of banana flower is missed.
I’m kinda bad at cooking but I tried this for the first time and it was really delicious ! Don’t forget to put the rice sticks in a big bawl of water during (at least) 2 hours If they are not fresh
I want to know if I could make this In a slow cooker/ crockpot.  I've seen instant pot recipes but I don't have one of those
thank u from philippines 😊
Can someone tell me the pad Thai noodle that are very chewy, the first time I ate at Hollywood restaurant the noodle are different I don’t want the Vietnamese banh pho?
I think I have a crush on this lady
Si tamari and tamarind sauce the same
This is marvelous. Thank you.
Nice and easy  to cook thanks beautiful .😎👍
Wow, your wok technique is perfect.
very good
Great I was having Green papaya curry with shrimp now I want pad Thai😂🤣😂 I love everything you do, I Love how you don’t have crazy music through your talking!!! I love how you post your recipe, how real you are in the kitchen with plating as well and I love pretty much every dish you’ve ever cooked and shared! I love you and you’re just adorable💝🌈💝
👍
The music and sound effects are also how I feel eating good Pad Thai 😍
사랑해요 ~~~
wanna know this recipe now i get it
thanks
omg 😳
She is so adorable I can't wait to try this recipe!
Well done…thanks
Do you have written recipe?
I’m sure it’s tasty but almost everything is preserved - just imagine the amount of chemicals in the ingredients. Plus the chicken needs to be well cooked.
I love it godbless
I found the fresh noodles at Walmart surprisingly
Very nice. The way/steps you make Pad Thai is pretty authentic as well!  And you said Pad Thai correctly as well!
I like ur recipes.
Awesome thanks 😊
can you send me this recipe pls?
This is amazing, my family loved it, thank you for sharing
I have the biggest crush on this woman. I would risk it ALL for her
What can I substitute for the tofu? TIA☺
Is it okay to replace the Tamarind concentrate for regular Tamarind paste? Haven't had any luck finding the concentrate in my groceries
I tried this with my fam so I had To quadruple the recipie. Not sure if the fish sauce ratio cant be multiplied or maybe we just are not used to authentic taste, but fish sauce taste was too strong for us
Food is look yummy 😋  Thank you for your video
hello my Pretty Mrs. You nailed!!! I'm 1/2 thai and 1/2 guam... it looks sooo delicious😋🥳🤩
Simply Amazing!
No frech vegetabel en ingrédients
This was amazing! I wish there was a LOVE button instead of just like! We are putting this on our dinner rotation list! Soooooo yummy!!!!!!! My favorite! You are an amazing cook! Thanks for sharing!
This looks fabulous!
Do you have a husband? Lol
Very Cool...!!!
omg... looks yummy.. i like thai food also even i'm filipino.. we love to go to night market when are in bangkok and get this as dinner... yummy. thank you for the recipe.
Her voice and excitement is really what did it for me! Can’t wait to try this!
What's the substitute for fish sauce ?
Thanks for making it look super easy. Will try it tonight. Cheers..
Just made this! It’s amazing 👌🏽
This looks. Good
I'm Thai, and I would say after watching many foreigners making Pad Thai, this is the real and authentic one !
The way she says noodles is so cute
She's cute. Nice presentation. Practice saying noodle in two words: new dull. Still, very nice and very helpful. I'm making a version of this, today! Always nice to see someone present this in a video first. I often take baby back ribs and save a few that are super long-braised and browned and then heat those up with the shrimp- I find cooking raw pork not to be very tender or flavorful. That's my tip. Oh, I have read recipes calling for one to three eggs- this is a nice balance with two.
I veganized the recipe by using fried tofu for the protein, vegan fish sauce from the Asian market in place of fish sauce, and JUST egg in place of eggs :) Everyone, even my "carnivore" friends, LOVED it!! Thank you for the recipe!! :D
대체 이 한국여자가 아니 경상도 여자가 뭘 만드는거냐! 결혼한서양남자가 태국에서 좀 살았었나봐. 팟타이 맛있어보이네. 헉…댓글쓰다보니 남편 나옴. 그냥 추측으로 쓴건데 역시네..
I love how Asian cuisines always come with loads of fresh sides and sauces, great food!!
Hallo
Can fish sauce be substituted with something else?
Oh my heavens above.That looks good enough too EAT!😁😊
after watching this, i decided to buy outside lol, too complicated
you call that easy?
you call that easy?
you call that easy?
I watch your clip over and over whenever I make Pad Thai. Thank you for sharing your recipes
Can i skip the radish?
I love thai kitchen so much, i hope to try it in Thailand someday
👍
Oh well you're amazing it's very easy and it's very delicious thank you for show us how to make in The amazing food it's so good thank you God bless you and keep showing us you culinarians delicious food
3:53 Black guy: oh yeah?
That looks like AMAZING Pad Thai! Thank you for sharing your recipe.
I'm definitely making this today thank you
The taste of authentic PadThai we eat should lead by the sweet and sour then salty and spicy btw this recipe and cooking method is real PadThai, good job
Bravo u explain well clearly the procedure
How many servings does this give?
I'm realizing that making Asian foods just isn't possible for someone living in a relatively small town. You simply can't get so many ingredients.
Thanks for the recipe. I’ll try it. Btw you’re beautiful!
You are so cute!
I love the way you make pad Thai simple and 😋
late to the party here but man....the host is amazing and the food looks incredible
looks good!
Can someone post the possible substitute ingredients like the tamarind and dried radish...
The shrimp shape is terrible
Uff delicious 😋😋😋 tnks.👏👏👏👏
So.complicated
Beautiful food beautiful young lady 👍👍👍

덕분에 잘 배워갑니다. 감사합니다. Thankyou for your Video. I have got to know by your teaching.
I made this recipe and it was better than any Pad Thai I can get at a restaurant in my hometown! None of them balance out sweet, salty, sour, and spicy like this recipe does!
Why use ounce? 😢 who uses ounce?
are the peanuts toasted?
Thank you!  Ive watched several and tried to cook a few of them and yours is the best!  And the little tips you mention really helps about the noodles and the other ingredients!  Yum yum yum!
Looks delicious. Thanks for sharing
I just made this today and I am blown away! I absolutely love this recipe and will definitely make it again. I think I'll try your drunken noodle recipe in a few days 😋 New subscriber!! Love from nyc 🧡
Not authentic
I can't find that dry fruit you chopped and the two thick paste sauces 😔 I want to make this so bad.
Seonkyoung- good recipe. Thanks
Super yummy i will try it tom
Making this tonight for dinner.  This is what happened when they only share the recipe!. HAHA
I can listen to her say nooders all day long. I told my wife I have a crush on her.
looks amazing thank you SEONKYOUNG!
looks very delicious.! Can you post more recipes for a couple (Korean wife and American husband who only likes American foods). He does not like Korean food and I do not enjoy American food much. I have been stressed out for more than 7 years with this issues
90 per cent of Thais will approve this recipe. This is how we traditionally cook it. The others have been adapted to foreigners' palate.
amazing!
I’m Thai, she is understand in pad Thai ingredients well ,correct correct It’s real taste
I like it !!!!
Your the best cook ever
잘봤습니다 맛있는 레시피 감사합니다
Awesome.....thank you for sharing
nooders... very nice.   delicious.  made some tonight.   kapunkap.
You are so beautiful.
I’m Thai and I also approve this 🇹🇭👍🏼 yumm
You didnt finish cooking the chicken, so its still raw (it doesnt get cooked in 1min at the end)? 🤨
My mouth is on fire watching that pile of Thai chilis disappear from the plate!
0:06 Can someone help me find this ingredient
This is look really good!!!
Cool!
Is there an alternative to a tamarind concentrate?
😋😋😋😋♥️♥️♥️
It looks so good!
I can't believe it, I judged accurately. I noticed this Asian lady was acting differently I had a hunge she is probably in a relationship with American/Canadian, then he shows up at the end
Nice nose contour job
I am starving now
this lady makes cooking a much easier task for me 🖤
Like Your Video.,💚👍🏽
Best Pad Thai so far!!
it not Pad Thai
Thank you for this recipe I was looking for one and I had the idea it was super hard to prepare it  I love Pad Thai
I like how you give substitute ingredients 🙏
Can I use thai dried relish instead of Thai sweet relish
This is a great recipe! Thank you very much (:
How to say "noodles" in Thai: "nooder"
Bean sprouts , I’ve heard is bad for you?
So delicious , love it 😍
Hi, I hope you can notice me hehe. What if I cant find any preserved radish or danmooji? What can I use to substitute it? I really want to try your recipe, I hope you can see this. Thankyou!
Looks delicious! For me some more sugar would be needed tho :P
This was delicious 😍 I'm not getting takeout again.
That flip is masterful
Wowww amazing 👏 yummy Pad Thai noodles 🍜 I wanna try to cook this recipe thanks for sharing stay connected 💖  advanced happy new year ahead .
고마워요 선경씨! I will try it. Thank you!
Thank you! I loved everything about this recipe and the way it was presented!

감사합니다 ㅠㅠㅠ 오늘 재료사러갑니당
Nagugutom ako.
Excessive ads, disliked.
I made this yesterday. It is delicious. Thank you, Seonkyoung!
Can we have the recipe for sweet crunch rice noodles pad tie please
I  love with your chanel so much 😍
I’d love to make it but no raddish here so it’s difficult to get the authentic flavor.  Any other substitute
toofoo
Love it, 👍💕
Rice noodles, Half onion, 2oz garlic chives, radish, shrimp, chicken, roasted peanuts, egg,   Sauce: fish sauce, brown sugar, sriracha, hoisin, wasabi mustard,  Add 1/4 water after boiling noodles
Oh so no garlic or cilantro hmmm
Every time I cook pad Thai I watch ur video thank you !!!
I love how this recipe turned out in my kitchen. Yey...
Nice content please do check. Mine too🙏
I have always been curious about pad thai and this video just sold me completely! Now I HAVE to try it!
How come my noodles were too sticky?
This looks like the ones I buy compared to all the other videos I have seen that looks like a mess.
I think you are truly awesome but must you emphasize the oriental accent.....I am Canadian Chinese an I find it's offensive and degrading so please stop
White Spaghetti
I am vegetarian but I love to cook this dish. What i can use instead of fish sauce?  please help.
I like this method
This is one of my favorite   thai food , super yummy!!!
I’m sad I can’t find the Thai sriracha anywhere 😭
Out of all the required ingredients ... I currently have water.
I'm wondering who taught her to cook the dish. It is amazing that she did it right in every aspect. Many Thais could not do it.
This looks really good, but where is the basil?
I would love to be Mr Longest
This is probably the best recipe that I've seen and I can't wait to try it out. Thanks for sharing!
I just tune in to your chanel for the first time and I love all your recepies  and great explenation on everything you prepare step buy step!❤
😉😍😄

masdfsdfhnsd dg
You look so cute here!
I just followed this recipe tonight and it was delicious! Way better than the restaurants! I didn’t have tamarind paste, so I just used tamarind block and soaked in water and lime juice.
Im pinay but i will try to cook for the very first time the pad thai and i chose your recipe. Thank you for sharing your recipe btw.
This recipe is so real. I really like the presentation. Thank you for sharing. I will certainly cook this tomorrow. Thumbs up for you. 👍👍👍 I believe many viewers like me will agree
Made0
Looks amazing! I can't wait to try this recipe. I have made Pad Thai many ways, this looks like it should be better than restaurant quality!
Looks like I’ll just order take out
I have a question on tamarind concentrate!  I've had Pad Thai several times in different places and never tasted tamarind concentrate before.   I got the same brand of tamarind concentrate that she's using but the smell was too strong as I cooked.. I put 1tsp as the instruction shows.   Please help me!!
I am so hungry!
I miss Chiang Mai.
What about the dried shrimp?
Beautiful! Here in Portugal, preserved radish is not a thing. Any ideas for a substitute?
Wow this looks scrumptious😊 Can you post all the ingredients please i really want to make this. TIA
wonderful recipe
I am Cambodian chef
Very good video, thank you very much sister
You cook to very well.... I watch to often your cook u- tube  You cook is good cook than the  others
We found that baking tofu in the oven, after it's been pressed and then soaked in oil and soy sauce, then coated in a little corn starch, is a great way to get a nice crispy tofu.
Thank you.
i love it one of my favorite Food
I want her to be the mother of my kids
Wow delicious can't wait to cook this .
can I use tamarind paste instead of tamarind concentrate

It looks so delicious .. I’ll try this soon  thank you for the recipe

Thanks so much for shared, I love your cooking show, love love love very much.
wow im ur no. 1 follower i love your cooking so much.
정말로 맛있겠네용~It looks really delicious. Yummy~~~!!!
I notice that eating too many foods with fish sauce makes the body stink, so with my thai dishes I have been subbing with tamari instead.
THANKS FOR SHARING... YUM....EEEEE
The best pad thai you'll ever have is on the streets of Bangkok. No fancy restaurants just a man and his wok.
ขอแสดงความยินดีอย่างสุดซึ้งสำหรับการสมัครสมาชิกเพิ่มเติม !!!
Na du bist ja ne hübsche Köchin! Schmeckt bestimmt lecker!!
Just made this for my family! It turned out amazing! I accidentally mixed up the order of things but the final result was great!
Love the plate you using, if you don't mind me asking where'd you get it from?
Patay
Pad Thai is one of the special dishes in Thailand...love to eat it with big prawns😍... i make Myanmar dishes and recipes too, if interested...go check out. You might want to try out something new😉 easy to cook!
stirred that sauce so effortlessly
Tested this recipe but the noodles appeared to be a littler dry. Cooked with a previously frozen noodles Fresh Rice Stick Noodle. Any ideas of how to add make them juicy?
Thanks for the teaching, now I can eat good meal😊😊😊
I love Phad Thai very much.Its so delicious 😋😊
Oh yea!
Rice neuters
Yummy 😋
I’m in Japan. I’m wondering if I can cook pad Thai with Worcestershire sauce instead of tamarind paste? Amazon said they will take 2 weeks to ship but I can’t wait to try this recipe!!! Also the picked radish is not common here either so I might use takuan (picked daikon)... I wish I could get asian groceries easily here even though I’m in Asia 🤣
Ughh of course he’s...
All I can do is pad Thai! 😫
0:24 - "..surprisingly super easy to make." ...but why when I tried to do the same, it came out completely different? I'm just so bad at this xD
I bought all the ingredients except for 2 of them because I don’t have access 🥴 to them rn hope it all turns out good
Now you know why that white guy married her. He gets to eat foods like this everyday instead of Spaghettios or cold cereals.
wonderful💕
Chives??? Shouldn’t you use scallions instead of chives...
hi, what is the best oil to use for pad thai??
Best recipe I've seen in a year or more
Made this using your recipe its amazing and excellent thank you for sharing
I really really really want to try thissssssss. I would love to search for this food when I'm able to travel to Thailand (hopefully next year).
Love this recipe ! My favorite
One question if I don’t have the sweet radish it will be the same or is necessary the radish ?
Actually, im going to try your pad Thai recipe this evening for our dinner. My hubby is always love pad Thai. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
She is annoying esp when she eats and dances.  Irritating   She puts alot of food in her mouth!!!! Eewwww. Not lady like!  Like you havent eaten in a week!!
Superb 😋
youre adorable
U the best cooking thai food
Ooh,  thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  🥰
I made this last night and it's a fantastic recipe!  I don't have a wok and used a straight walled stainless pan.  Needed to add a bit more water because it evaporated off to quickly to cook the noodles.  I've struggled to get Pad Thai right before, and this worked like a charm!  I'm very excited to play with the ratios of the sauce ingredients to see how that changes things.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!
My most favorite food. I will try this recipe too
It looks so yummy 👍🏻
Does anyone here thinks 3 tablespoons of fish sauce is too salty? It is for me. This is the second time I cooked this and I added more palm sugar but it is still salty. Maybe next time I will try just 1 tablespoon of fish sauce.
I love phad thai
I’m hungry 😋
The video going great was great until the white hairy thing appeared on camera.
Basically you add everything you find in your fridge
I've been visting Thailand for nearly 30 years and the food has changed over that time to more suit the Western pallet. After making this version of Pad Thai, it was like the scene from the movie "Ratatouille" where the food critic was whisked back into his chilhood memories. This is how I remember Pad Thai being on my first visit to Thailand. This video is now in my permanent library. I've been able to source all the ingredients from the local Vietnamese store here in Chesterfield UK all except the sweet radish but that was never part of my original experience.
너무 맛나보여요. 침이 꼴깍
The Best Pad Thai Tutorial I've ever seen! 😀
love when she says “asiaannn at hoomeee” 😍😍🥰❤️❤️
Pan is Tfal... It’s not ratchel ray listed on description box
Yum!!!!!!
I had Pad Thai for the first time during my trip to Thailand, but it was so delicious that I ate every day during my trip to Thailand.😄👍💙💙
Is there any way  I can substitute tamarind sauce with something else?
I guess I will just go to Red Thai in Hollywood FL too much work for me
Thanku for the written recipe
Hi what is the alternative ingredient for raddish aside from the korean ingredient? Thanks!
Hi! This one is my fave thai food   https://youtu.be/13h9VYNeSRs
MARRY ME!!!
Oh my god I think I'm in love with her.
성경롱기스트 의미가 궁금해요! 영상 잘봤어요!!💓
Tries to find ingredients in grocery stores...  "guess I'll take out"
한국분이신가요?
No garlic in this dish?
look so yummy I will cook it I like the way you eat
3:28 is it “three” tbsp or “two” tbsp
I tried to make Pad Thai a couple of years,  following another recipe, didn't come out well and gave up on making it. I came across this recipe a few a weeks ago!!! And ohh man!!! Its the best recipe!! Easy to follow...the taste is 🔥!! Love it!! I make this recipe at least 2x a week!!! Thanks a million🤤
This is for real! The best ever!
How I miss Pad-Thai~  If it’s not because the covid-19, I’ll be running to my fav PadThai store like rn.
May I know the size if your wok pls? Love your recipes u are so beautiful n talented
Made this  tonight and it was the best I’ve ever made.  The technique helped me cook everything perfectly.   I used premade sauce and left out the radish, added some fish sauce and lots of water to get the noodles properly cooked and able to separate.  Added cilantro as a garnish.  So good, thank you for the instructional video
You are so gracious and sweet to watch, it’s a pleasure watching your videos 😊
I must try this recipe few days later, need to buy fish sauce and tamarind sauce. To be honest, thats looks awesome, Thank you for your recipe!
OMG She's so beautiful, dam wish I saw her on the street.
I've watched this video for about 10 times and finally got the courage to try it for I was craving for it for weeks. thank you so much for this recipe. wish I could send you the picture and the video of my version. love it!
This was my first time cooking with fish sauce. When I added it to the noodles I was sure it was going to be a disaster. But it turned out great, at least as good as I get at average Thai restaurants. Thank you!
good job
I can’t wait to make this!!!
kemah molek mek
Thấy ngon va đi 🤝🤝🤝
Thanks
She is just a ray of sunshine!
Ur makeup so pretty ur skin glows please do makeup tutorial
Habla muy rápido 😖
I am Thai and she can do Padthai Noodle!
Still so yummy!! 😊😋🤤❤🖒❤🖒
You're so adorable! You're beauty and charisma are so distracting! You've made my favorite dish yummy! Thanks to you I just learned to scramble eggs with chopsticks.  Boy! It does make a difference!🤩
THIS IS NOT PAD THAI AT ALL, PAD THAI NEED TO BE SWEET, SOUR, AND SALTY YOU DONKEY!
🙏♥️
You left out how do you cook the flat noodles?
if I don't have both the ingredients (sweet radish and danmooji) then what can I add instead? help me !!!!!
팟타이 어떻게 만드는지 궁금했는데 알려주셔서 감사합니다. 레시피도 그렇지만 좋은 에너지를 받아가는것 같아 기분이 좋네요. ^^
Rice nooders! Love the lesson!
What would I add if I use pad thai paste that has the spices already in it?
You are so adorable! Can’t wait to make this for the family tomorrow!!!
You have the best personality ever!!!  I wish you were my best friend 🖤
Went to Ranch 99 market and could not find fresh or dried Rice Nooders anywhere...
I made this and it’s very easy. My family is so impressed that it turned out so very good.
I can only get tamarind chutney ..can I use that instead of tamarind paste?
Thank You..you are sooo cute..this seems really original..my cuz is married to a Korean we are filipino..hes always had good eats at home ..
This guy won in the lottery. Congrats!
I bought all the ingredients today and I am making my first Pad Thai tomorrow :)
Can one use tamarind paste instead of concentrate?
Omg you are a life savor plus you are adorable
Sweeet 😍
Where can i get the complete Pad Thai recipe as in the ingredients and measurements. Please
I can watch all her videos before, during, and after Rona Quarantine 2020
The some  ingredients missing...i.e. Banana fruits...
Are you Thai? Doesn't look like one...
Thanks for this Seonkyoung! I have been looking for a good pad thai recipe for a long time and I am so glad I found this in your channel.
Hello. I noticed you did not seasoned the chicken and shrimp? Do you need to?
Love your elephants shirt! You’re so cute!

you know it is authentic because of the way she pronounces noodles
Stumbled upon this and host is delightful!
Well I WAS gonna ask if you’d marry me so that I could cook Cajun/Creole food for you and you could cook Thai food for me and then I saw your wedding ring 😕 heartbroken 😭 Oh well, I’ll still give you a thumbs up and say thank you for sharing, I love Thai food so much, and a good Pad Thai recipe is at the top of my list to learn. ขอขอบคุณ
Hi i like your way of cooking it, this is almost like how my grand mum and i do.  Khob khun krub ;)
I love pad thai 😋
Hope you can visit me too.😊
So yummy. I will make that too in my youtube account.
Enjoyed the background music, too!! Well done video!! Your teaching was very good, too!!

선경님 팟타이 레시피 진짜 맛있네요 ^^
Watching this video while eating instant ramen.....I feel cheated!
I'm a Filipina but I love Thai cookings..I like the blend of sweet sour of tamarind taste..I learned the taste when I was in Singapore..I can cook some of the recipes but some ingredients are hard to find here sometimes in Palau..🤗
This is a beautiful recipe!!!!!!!!! I'm making this tonight!!! Thank you so much for this video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wonderful! I'll make some tomorrow.
Thank you so much for this delicious recipe, and for your ongoing efforts to provide us with inspiring and excellent recipes that we can prepare at home. Also like yours and Jacobs funny and entertaining ways!!! Go team!!!
I’m a Filipina but I love so much the food of Thai ...I love Thailand !!!!! The massage ,the food and the people are so friendly and helpful also ...
you're a beautiful sweet lady. love your recipe. looks delicious..i'm gonna try it today. thanks for sharing.
You are so charming! You present this kinda “complicated”  recipe in simple and easy to understand step by step procedure and voila the end product is simply appetizing!!! The way your hubby (is he) reacts to that yummy Pad Thai diah tells it all!
Seonkyoung, thank you for demonstrating  an easy, but delicious way to make Pad Thai at home.
I don't have tamarind paste so I squeezed in water, and the result my pad thai tastes good but the color is pale.... I had to put thick soy sauce or Indonesian kecap manis to get brown color
So adorable and I love the details in the video❤️❤️
Dam i gotta look down the isle for some quality "noodrs" lol jk
wow fast! was the vr efpgies cookid .
누나 피쉬소스는 굳이 꼭 안 넣어도 되는 거지용?

I tried this recipe long time ago. It was delicious. I am cooking this today again. Can't wait to eat it!
Your accent is so cute!!! 😍
626 Thumbs down? They probably don't know good food when they see good food!
You cook very well Seonkyoung Longest I am really enjoying your videos amazing! Thank you for sharing ❤️
Are you you Korean ??  Just guessing by how you pronounce things that's cute ^^
Me & my girlfriend went to Thailand Bangkok & Krabi for 2 weeks. Our biggest regret is not spending more time there but Pad Thai & Mango sticky rice were our favourite dishes. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I bought that tamarin paste last week it really does make it come together. I always coat mine in peanuts & chilli flakes. What a dish!
She is pretty
I like watching you eat it, I can see you enjoy it and I am certain it is so tasty.
yummy pad thai
This recipe is amazing!!!!!! Love it.. I've made this and my husband think I ordered take out from thai restaurant lol..
Noodrs lol
I know Absolutely Nothing about Thai Food OR Ingredient’s!! What is the Best Tamarind Concentrate to purchase? Can you get it at the Asian Market?? What about Fish Sauce? Or Hoisin Sauce?? Or even Soy Sauce??😮😨😳🙏🙏🙏
Is it real pad Thai? It has so less oil.
Can't wait to try!
Hy gay it cooking with pooo(gas pasing
I am really enjoying learning how to cook without pounds of meat to create a dish. I was like,”3 oz meat? 3 oz shrimp!??” Learning how to let meat be a co-star, not the focus. Thanks:)
Yeah, Thai is one of those countries where the west screws up the food and somehow still thinks it tastes good. The positive is that when they visit Thailand, they get a huge surprise of what they were missing haha. Great recipe! Thanks for showing these people what real Thai food is!
yummy yummy😘😘😘😘
She had at me at noodles :3
Wow love this video Seonkyong ❤️😘
I can't find preserved turnips anywhere. Is there any other sort of substitute I could use? Is it necessary to make pad thai?
Her accent is hot haha
lol.. when she said DAAAFFFENEDLY i wheezed
I.like you
Probably the best pad thai on YouTube
Wonderful.... I love pad thai... am new friend from Italy.... like for you....
Could you BE more adorable??
What is a Newter?
You are extremely sweet and I love the way you talk! It's so cute! I just love your recipe! 😘😘😘 Lots of love for you dear!
Ive never seen pad thai with tofu before
nooders
Hey fellow cooks.  So I'm following this recipe directly but the tamarind I have is nothing like as thick... It's actually runny (TRS brand, tall thin blue bottle, red cap,400g) Since I'm not yet able to figure out what the sauce should taste like uncooked could you possibly tell me how much of the runny tamarind makes up the concentrated paste she uses?
Delicius and you're  very very very beautiful girl
Loved it. My toddler is addicted to the music at the end that goes laa laa la la. Can you pls tell me the name of that track?
you using teflon crap frypan.  Thats' awful. you not really a true chef tho
I made it and it came out awesome!! Thank you, looking to tweak it to make a keto version.
Beautiful
Just made this recipe. It was extremely delicious. Only thing I'd change is adding in more sugar. I'm assuming that's only the case with me not being able to find any preserved sweet radish. Loved it nonetheless.    P.S. if anyone knows of an alternative to the sweet radish (besides adding more sugar) please let me know
Seonkyoung Longest, I LOVE YOU ! This food is amazing and I should know as I have been fed by BOTH past Royal Thai Family Chefs. They used to spoil me in Reno Nevada, at the Siamese Hut Thai Restaurant, which is now closed, Pad Thai, Stuffed Chicken Wings , Mi Krop & Satay, and all of it drowned in the famous Thai Peanut Sauce. You are amazing, tell your Husband I am jealous, he is a VERY VERY VERY Lucky man ! I almost married a Thai & a Japanese, but ended up with a Filipino. I live in Cebu Philippines, and Your Thai cooking Recipes has saved me as all thai restaurants here are Horrible, My wife LOVES your food too. Thank you so much for sharing the Secrets to amazing Thai cooking! Blessings, Regards Marcello & Maricar~
Can you Add Coconut Oil?
👍👌🏽❤️🤤🤤
The sauce is not the best recipe, not even close. The best Pad Thai needs the best sauce you can make prior to cooking and store in the frigidaire  for future use .
Where do you buy your pan and what brand  is this??
_nooders_
Nooders
Noobles and prawns are my favourite,  I love this dish 💋💋
This was the worst pad Thai recipe I’ve never tried
I love it....from Pak
I think she has a Korean father and a Thai mother. I wonder if I'm right.
I am a Pad Thai fanatic and this recipe is awesome! I lived in Australia for 14 years and had the most amazing Thai, Malay, Indonesian food that I dearly miss. It took me a few tries to find all the ingredients in my area, but it was so worth it! Thank you Seonkyoung, fantastic job!
She hot love nooders
Why aren't you in the Masterchef yet??? 🙈
Can’t wait to make this, all your recipes are amazing. Dad made me the designated chef of the family now thanks to you 😂
Ver y good  ,from Madrid...
I’m thai but I hate thai food all I do is eat American foods McDonald’s Burger King pizza 🍕 and Italian foods ... ever since I came to USA 🇺🇸 and got my citizenship I never look bac at my thai foods .. I don’t even know what it taste like ... I still eats American foods ...
Amazing I love pad Thai food I will definitely make for dinner 🥘
Hi Seonkyoung Longest - Just tried the recipe tonight! It was awesome! Thank you. K
Killer Pat Thai!!! 🥰🥰🥰
SIMPLEMENTE    DELICIOSO!!!
Thanks for sharing. I made it with tofu and vegetables and it turned out great.
Did she say “hydroway”? Instead of hydrate?
I like it ❤❤❤❤
Love ur cooking style
uhmm i'm hungryyyyyyyyy😁
Is that chicken even cooked?
OMG 😋
Yummy , yummy !!! 🤗🤗🤗🤗
I love Thai food and Thai people in general .. I am a big fan of AHAN CHE (vegetarian) Thai food which brings out the real flavours of Thai ingredients. Thanks for showing the recipe
Love you so much! Thank You for your wonderful recipe and wonderful charm.
I like this Seoun Younk Longest better than the one right now!!!! She became too overrated when talking or too extra. She should watch this video vs the newer videos (last couple 5 videos) hard to watch without thinking, she’s too much! And it is not cooky , just overrated!
Can you make a Chinese spicy black bean alternative with chickpeas? Soy beans are originally uses so chickpeas should be great. Love the spiciness.
i'm drooling right now!
on what planet was that palm real palm suger?
Hi there, I used fresh Thai noodles, but it is so dry and hard not soft.
Asia at hoooooooome 😭🤣 love it
Ur hair 😍😍😍 u re so pretty

Perfect Pad Thai! The best one I’ve seen so far
Can’t wait to make this 🤤🤤🤤

It looks good and super easy to follow!
Thank you! I've been wanting to learn how to make this dish at home! Looks great!
Wow. Your gorgeous 😍
I LOVE your accent! Can you tell me some replacement for the radish?
Are you supposed to add cilantro? I've seen it done in restaurants
Very good and the fish sauce doesn't taste nearly as much and as bad as it smells. This dish brings back memories from Thailand
I love you. <3
What oil would you recommend?
Looks so tra-DISH. Almost as if I can smell and taste it. Cheers to you!
I just tried this recipe and the only thing to say is WOW - THIS IS AMAZING!  Made enough to have left-over for tomorrow.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!  Thank you.
Looks Soooooo delish😍😍😍
อย่าใส่ถั่วลิสงบด ลงผัดพร้อมผัดไทยครับ เพราะคนแพ้ถั่วหรือไม่ชอบอาจทานไม่ได้  ที่ไทย...เขาไม่ผัดร่วมกัน ควรแยกให้เติมเองตามใจชอบ
You go girl. Thank you so much!
Amazing recipe ! Tastes awesome
I tried this one from our malaysian friend before, and i miss it so much, thank god i found it, thai food are really amazingly delicious
OMG I love you and your recipes and videos Sooooo much. I found you on Utube about two weeks ago and have been watching at least 3-4 hours a day since! Although I have a disability I can still cook so this means a lot to me. Thank you for teaching me how to do great Asian food!
I'm half Thai and I love the colour of the noodles in your recipe. I always aim for that consistency. I can't find a restaurant in Leeds that uses authentic ingredients! I'm very impressed with your cooking.
Your recipe looks delicious and your presentation is excellent. Your accent is super cute too. =
What a pretty girl and the food looks so nice!
I just made a keto version. Thanks for the recipe!
Wow she is gaining lot of weight.
That lucky guy!
What kind fish sauce do you use?
ughhh pad thai is my favourite food ever this looks so GOOD...
looks soooooo good !
Thank you for this recipe. My family loves it more than our favorite Thai restaurant!  How long do the tamarind concentrate and palm sugar last in the fridge?
😋😋
Awwww your outfit was so cute tho
It's yammyyy..but what about salt and pepper?
Hi! I tried this recipe and it is absolutely DELICIOUS. I’ve been buying pad thai from restaurants before I decided to make them myself. I’m glad I found your recipe, it’s even better than the ones I buy from the restaurant. I’ve also made it for other people, and they tell me that it’s absolutely delicious.   On a side note, since I couldn’t find some of the ingredients you have here in the Philippines, these are the changes I made:  -Spring onion instead of chives -Skipped the preserve raddish (it’s still good!) -White sugar instead of palm sugar, and also added one tbsp on top of two -Cayenne pepper to spice it up -Since I used dried rice noodles, I soaked it in boiling water for around 3-5mins -Calamansi instead of lemon  The tamarind concentrate was the hardest to find, but I found it online regardless.  I rate this recipe 10/10. Thank you!
Wowww your makeup is really nice! Natural but stands out! 😆
Nice video , I love pad Thai I’m going to make this and send it to you when I do lol , thank you
I swear she sounds Korean
I like the way she does flipping when she stir fries. She is great at that!
can i remove the palm sugar or any other kinds of sugar for the sauce or will it be too salty then ?
That looks so good. I'm from Peru and love Thai food since I live in California 😍 I'll try to make it!!
JUST MADE THE RECIPE IT WAS AMAZING   I did not add shrimp or sweet potato it still came out amazing !
OMG....it looks soooo good. I will try.
Looks pretty good.  The recipe I've been using for years (from a pretty well-known Thai Youtube chef) includes dried shrimp, and the ratios for the sauce are quite a bit different (more tamarind, less fish sauce), but otherwise, it's spot on.
You know your food is good if the thai lady has a strong accent
Sounds yummy
I miss thai food 😩😔 like ur video from philippines...👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🇵🇭
Thank god this exists on Youtube.
She's fine!!
I'm definitely trying to do it at home. The first time i ate pad thai i fell in love with the flavor. So delicious!
Thank you  you explained things well.💕💕💕
Tried the recipe, very impressive. Here are some personal advice. 1. 4oz of noddle is not enough! It was so delicious and the noddle were gone after three bites, lol. 2. I used tamarind paste instead of concentrate, and I totally prefer tamarind paste. 3. You need to soak dried rice noddle in hot water, preferably boiling water, till it's totally soft, otherwise it may remain too chewy. 4. You can totally modify proportion of sauces to meet your personally flavor, for example, I reduced the sugar. 5. Pressed tofu is the best! Probably for non-Asians it is not a big deal, but for us, we take tofu seriously : P
Everything is great about this recipe except the prep for the noodles. DO NOT just soak the noodles in warm water. That will not soften the noodles enough. Instead, boil the noodles like pasta for soft tender noodles. Your'e welcome! :)
No noodle at home so Im going to make somtam instead😝
I love her ingredients list so authentic
How about the coconut sugar?and what is in korean?the radish you use?
Pad Thai is my favorite food 🍲 I really want to learn how to make real Thai food
I love Asian food deliciuos

I preferred  Mr. Tan recipes much more. That’s a real authentic Pad Thai I grew up with! This one is better than nothing, nothing much. Btw, I think she just copied the Thai chef. She’s Korean!.
Thank you for sharing. Yummy! 👍👍👍
Lol why am I watching this at 3am? I’m not mad about it though

بالعربية من فظلك
I need this in my life. 😁
Pad Thai is my favorite dish ever!
Yup... the real deal...nice video! You can play with the branding labels and quality level of individual ingredients that suit your taste and pocketbook.The use of fish-sauce and tamarind is growing in the USA. The video looked like the noodles were cooked perfectly.
Yummy..... What brand is your wok?
Someone call the police, this woman has stolen Janet Jackson's nose!
Can you be able to make this without peanuts cause I’m allergic to peanuts
This is the best Pad Thai ever! I make it all the time now, and everyone loves when I prepare this dish. This recipe tastes better than what you get at restaurants. Seonkyoung, thank you for sharing your recipes with the world☺
It looks delicious I wanna try👍🏻😀
I am pretty much a vegan so I make this.
Bean sprouts are great.
I love Pad Thai. Omg. This is awesome.
Mmmmmmmmmm delicious and so easy to make.  My first pad Thai
Omg!!!!! That's my lunch tomorrow..
Authentic Thai we don't put red onion.
Yeah that was sooo good... Pad Thai is also my favorite..
Thank you for using real padthai sauce. It looks really good. It gets on my nerve every-time people say they use peanut butter😏
I would love to try to make this Pad Thai but where do I find the recipe???
Better then gordon ramsay
Chujowe to gowno
Chujowy ten ramen
I would recomemded  to to tamaried in the package and soaked in the water for 30 mins made the sauce so much better. Good Luck & Looks delicious anyway.
I ask my Asian girlfriend to say, "Oodles of Noodles", all the time. Trust me it is the funniest thing ever, and it will make you so in love with Asian women it's ridiculous!!  Lol
I need a wife like you
Awesome, thanks!
How do you get the noodles to not stick when cooking?
Great video thanks Seonkyoung!
You are to cute..🤗
🤤
Pad Thai. Is the best ! You have to go to Thailand to truly enjoy it. Kind of like how Chinese food in America isn't genuine Chinese.
U soooo cute, marry me😍
I could eat Pad Thai every day and never get tired of it.
is this real
Too cute!
Aditionary crunch?
Très dommage qu’il n’y ait pas de traduction en français, vraiment dommage.  Zenete depuis le Pacifique sud
Pad Thai, it s created in Gen. Por/priminister who wanted to decrease power of Chineses citizen in Thailand; then, dark soya sauce is not add. Thais know it! Be aware ! I love other dishes which you show,  not this one.
I was Just watching to see her mouth full.
I love nooders
Thanks so very much! This is one of my favorite dishes 😃
Any substitute for tamarind?
This is the best phad thai video
Will you marry me and feed me???
I just made this recipe for dinner.   It was very good.  Everyone enjoyed it.   I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for sharing!!!
Yum I can’t wait to make this
Wow really nice! And great video, will try this definitely!👍
태국에서 사온 팟타이 소스가 있는데 어떡해 사용하면 좋을까요?
I just did it and am eating it while typing. It is really good but at the asian store I went they gave me preserved turnip instead of radish. Do you know if I'm actually far from your recipe in term of taste?? Its actually pretty good and I tasted the preserved turnip before adding it and I kind of really like its taste.
Aight.
I'm from a small town in Brasil, I'm afraid I won't be able to find the tamarind, even on online stores... I know it won't be the same without it, but is there any thing that I can use to substitute it? To at least get the same consistency or amount of sauce?
Just made this, it was so tasty. Thank you for the video :D
Wow I made it today and it was delicious! THANKS!
im so excited to try this, it looks delicious and you give such an easy recipe
Where do i get these type of Nooders?
I’ve seen recipes where people add ginger to provide the sour to the pad thai, is that correct or this is the original recipe ?
Wow very nice.
I made Pad Thai last night. I do a simple recipe. Chicken, scrambled eggs, green onions, shreaded green cabbage and carrots. I season it with turmeric, onion power, and salt. I also add orange juice and soy sauce, along with Pad Thai sauce. I then add cooked rice noodles in my wok. It's a lovely delicious and simple recipe. I then garnish with peanuts. Yum.
How do I get the recipe and print it?? I love this.
This looks amazing. Most authentic I’ve seen!
I made this and I’m literally shook. Better than my favorite Thai restaurant.
Hi Seonkyoung, I have access to Million's of TV Viewers in the USA, your content is great, would you like to reach them?
Nice 😃
Loved when you said  “For people who like extra Spicey  ME!” Delicious 😋
She is right on, great food. She is so cute.
You are so sweet! New subbie ♥️
Looks great, I gotta try it! Thanks Seonkyoung
I can never properly mix the ingredients, it’s so hard! But I love this dish so I really want to make it again
I already try it n the taste is good!..coz i dont have black tumarik..i change with sweet sauce,chicken broth n sesame oil in the end..
What brand of tamarind paste and palm sugar do you buy? The ones at my asian grocery stores have tamarind concentrate that is more liquid and light in color. Also the palm sugar is usually hard and solid not sticky like yours. Do you do something to the palm sugar first?! Thanks to anyone with info!
You’re so adorable!
Been making my Pad Thai this way..ty ty😘😘😘
👍 😘
What is that awful smell in pad thai in restaurants? I reheated one and there was a stinky smell. It was not going bad...maybe some additive or the fish sauce.
I have questions.. I have looked for tamarind pasteand preserved radish at h mart and ranch 99. Where in the store will I find these two ingredients. What section, aisle? Thank you.
My girlfriend introduced me to this dish and now I'm going to cook it for her, thank you for the easy and delicious recipe
I need to make this!
You're soooo pretty!  Awesome video
Why is your name Longest? Which part of you is the longest?
Wow that looks incredible!!
Nuders
I am so in love with you 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Thank you, I will try this this weekend!!
Thanks
I heard bean sprouts are not good for you?
Noodiies
Love your videos!!!
Original Pad Thai should has tiny dried shrimp.
팟타이 소스만들기 영상을 찾다가 들어와봤어요!  멋지십니다.
This was such an awesome recipe!! Thanks!
Thank your recipe, Seonkyoung Longest. Today I cooked follow your recipe and the pad thai is amazingly delish! Highly recommend this for all you guys :)))
O. K. มันน่าทานมากเลยค่ะ
Excellent!  Thank you!
Cant help but to smile at the end of every video. 😄
What can I use instead of presereved thai sweet radish? Thanks
*Who's here after Ariana Grande's IMAGINE*
I can say that this recipe in the clip is quite correct. But the way she season pad Thai’s  sauce is not that right one. Too less tamarind sauce. She also put too much pickled radish and neglect adding some dried shrimps into that Pad Thai. The main concept of Pad Thai is every ingredients can delivery a balance flavor as well as a balance texture in one spoon. The flavor have to be a little bit sweet (palm sugar) and sour (from tamarind sauce) not too much salty since dried shrimps will do its  job in this dish not fish sauce. Anyway this is not bad for Korean making Pad Thai.  Thank you for loving Thai food. Btw...I am Thai.
No real pad Thai you gotta make the tamarind sauce from scratch. If you don’t do that then you can’t call it authentic!
... super thick and super dark. Which is i love. *smirk* uhh, ok
Just made this and it did not turn out like yours at all lol!  no matter how much I try, my dish will never look (and probably taste) as good as yours!
Small bites madam
Me and my wife are Pakistani and we really like Thai food. My wife introduced me to pad Thai at a restaurant in the US, and I have been a fan ever since. I have since moved out from the US and now across the border. we were looking for a great pad Thai recipe that would be restaurant grade. Today my wife tried this recipe at home,and we were blown away as to how good it is. It is as good l, if not better than most of the restaurants we've tried in North America. Many thanks for putting this up and I would highly recommend people watching this to try this recipe if they want restaurant grade pad Thai at home.
Forget the recepie can I just pleasseeeee marry her 😍😍😍😍
Thank you looks very good!
Amazing.
Dang I'm so hungry now.
“Order me pad Thai”
It’s really cute that your hubby joins you at the end to feast on the yumminess of what you have prepared.
Wow!!  This is the best recipe I’ve found so far for Pad Thai.  You’re an artist .  Thank you!
와... 팟타이소스랑 면만사고 걱정이 많았는데 재료 설명감사해요. 냉장고에서 대체재료 찾아서 할 수 있을 것 같아요. 감사합니다:)
Our family lived in Chiangmai for 15 years and found the best pad thai in all of Thailand. This recipe is as real as it gets. You rock Seonkyoung. Yummy yummy.
Thanks you for sharing
น่ากินมากๆ..
Lived there for 12 years and this is the best youtube recipe I have seen and the presentation is great
Pls anyone answer me. The tamarined concentrate is necessary?
I love Thai food as of recently. Your food looks really good. I will be doing some shopping at the Asian Market so I can start making your dishes.
I did ur recipe Seonkyoung!!!! And I love it 🥰. I can finally make a Pad Thai...thank u
Well done.. Very nice job
Omg... This looks so goooddddddd
Wow. That looks delicious. Love from India
발음이 한국인같다
too much talking..
She's saying a whole bunch of nothing. Get to it lady!!!
Uhmmm... I'm wondering for 4 portions which ingredients should I increase for the sauce? Or it is enough?
She is so beautiful! Can't wait to try this recipe
That looks great! Will try this one indeed.  Thanks for sharing and you are so pretty!
I'm a beginner in cooking, the rice noodles are they were boiled before ?
we cannot find here the dry radish, any substitution plz
That looks so yummy
Can I skip the radish or substitute with anything else? I can’t find it here and I desperately want to know how to make pad Thai at home!
Fantastic!  The two best things in this video for me are,  one,  the combination of cooking some of the essential ingredients and again, including them again as fresh for serving. And two, showing how to properly eat and combine it with the chopsticks.
I don't knownwhy but I thought the sauce would be, like, difficult or contain a lot of different ingredients. This is SO SIMPLE!! Definitely going to try making it, I just need to stop by the Asian grocery store first...
Very good explanation good job 👏
Awesome 💕
https://youtu.be/t04aiTUf80I

I like pad Thai, my local restaurants don’t make it food though. I wonder if it’s fine to omit the shrimp, as it gives me a mild allergic reaction in my throat, and I also hate the taste of shrimp.
I like your down pad thai
This looks fantastic
Learn English languge for chef-kok
This is real Pad Thai, guarantee  by me >_< i’m Thai
Looks so yummy🖤
Prepare my rice “Nooders”
I will try this today.thank you for sharing this recipe. ❤
好棒
You have a sister that cook too? Asking for a friend
You can't go wrong with Pad Thai  ;-)
It’s look amazing. I’m going to try it today.
is Tamicon (Indian) Tamarind Concentrate better than Tamarind (Thai) Paste ?
Wow! That looks amazing, thank you for the recipe!
can we use tamarind powder for tamarind paste? although i'm just not sure how sour it should be.
I went to Thailand when i was a kid to visit my Dad. It I was the first time i had Pad Thai and now its pretty much my favorite food.I need to learn how to cook it to support my habit. lol  This will be the first time I am going to try and cook it myself. Thanks to our hostess I learned to make fried rice and its the only recipe I have used since. Cant thank you enough!! Best cooking vids!
So delicious looking
The color of my pad thai is so pale, probably because i use regular sugar?
Wow, bravo !! High level compared To other recipes on youtube. Merci pour la recette 👍 Je vais essayer de trouver les tiges d ail, sinon je remplacerai par des spring onions.
Nooders
So deliciously
วัตถุดิบหลักๆถือว่าผ่าน ขาดแค่กุ้งแห้งเท่านั้น น้ำมะขามเปียกเคี่ยวข้นเลยสีเข้มไปนิด และปกติไม่ใส่ซอสศรีราชาไทยแต่ช่วยเพิ่มสีได้ ส่วนที่เพิ่มไก่ก็แล้วแต่คนชอบ
like the recipe, just would add some lime juice into the pan and some abrasion from the lime skin
Looks like pailins recipe
Mmmm Yummy & Delicious - the Pad Thai's not bad too.
Love it
thanks for video..I love your voice!
You had me at nooders.
Noodur
God damn you talk too much.
Thanks for the recipe, Seonkyoung 👍
Love it 😍😘
I really like this dish, being American, it took me a lot of research to discover the real secret ingredient is tamarind paste, really balances, fish sauce and red curry paste. Only a million different recipes.
you're lovely and beautiful plus your simple recipe makes this one a "killer pad thai video".
291 idiots disliked this video!!!☹️😒🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽
So goodddddd~ your pad Thai is like Thai do!!!
Your pad thai looks more authentic and looks better than a pad thai in a Thai restaurant i’m working in Birmingham tbh!
neuters...
좋은 영상 감사합니다
So this is basically the same video from Hot Thai Kitchen, but with a different host?
Look very good😀
I haven’t came across a pad Thai I like but this looks good. I’m gonna try this recipe.
Thank you for the video, very explicative! Which kind of oil do you use? palm, coconut or others? any suggestion?
I made this last week and am making it again tonight. So simple and delicious! Thanks for your great recipes, nooder queen.
Omg, I’ve finally found the best pad Thai recipe. Thank you 🙏!!!
Ooh
great video!!!
would the palm sugar be found in Korean markets?
I made this yesterday and it was so yummy! I added too much noodles so there wasn’t enough sauce, BUT it still was yummy and I’m excited to try again with the said noodle amount ❤️
Actually not bad, Im Thai, despite the American name.  I add Oyster sauce and Maggi for extra flavor.  But this is not bad pad Thai  "noodeerrr"
Just tried, Amazing pad Thai! love your recipe! Keep going!
Sorry, wrong from beginning to the end. What you are cooking is not authentic Pad Thai, just an imitation one!
Thank you Seonkyoung your name sounds like Korean but what you did is the Real PadThai.You make Thai people like me mouth watering.
You are so pretty! I got all the ingredients and I’m trying it tonight. However my palm sugar cane in a block form and I saw yours was softened? I guess I’ll figure it out! Thank you for this awesome video!
I'm so hungry. Why did u do that to me.
I would think you should cook the chicken a little longer before you add the shrimp!!!
Tasty! 😎
From Thailand: approved. :-)
Just discover pat tai  at the weekly farmer market. Love it.
I really like your top!
This looks soo yummy!
❤💚💜 nudle...lol you just to cute!!!
Do you know that the original Pad Thai has dried shrimp in it? As a Thai growing up eating pat thai once in a while would say Pad Thai without dried shrimp is really lacking. It maybe delicious, but still lacking.
very good
Pad Thai noodles is a other one of my favorite dish. I go to restaurants to eat it.Watching you make it was easy..no more restaurants.I'll make it myself.Thank you chef Seonkyoung ,awsome video!!
I tried this recipe and it turned out very good. You really need a wok though.
Very Nice Videos.   Thank you.   I’ve been watching a bunch of em.  Gonna try out your recipies.   You are fun to watch.

Wow you’re a real cook!
I've had so many failed attempts at pad thai--- tried yours tonight and WOW. Thank you so so so much ❤️💖
Is pad thai supposed to smell 'bad'? I've had it and sometimes it just smells of peanuts and spices and other times it smells (not to offend) like a kennel/wet dog. lol I know it's probably the fermented sauce but is that smell normal? can it be cooked off?
Hello I really loved pad thai but its very hard for me to find tamarind paste can you tell me how to make tamarind paste from the scratch please thank you
Eat PHOnomenal.  Stay hungry my friends!
She got a white man ? Lol
What lucky man put a ring on her finger? 👌🏼
What the hell kind of shallots is she using where HALF of one is 2oz, lol
Its 2018 and by far you have to most accurate padthai recipe among non- thai chef youtubers. No offense!! Love you
I don’t have and can’t find any tamarind concentrate. Is there a substitute that I can use?
I'm Thai and I love this recipe. It's authentic! looks good and you can't find Pad Thai like this at any Thai restaurant in USA.
Wow  It's look good  and seem to be best Pad Thai that made by foreigner.
this looks good
yummy this dish looks fresh ,healthy& so delicious..I'm going to try and cook it now..Thank you..

Can you show me how to make Vietnamese rice roll ?
Awesome  recipe   seonkyoung longest
So delicious I will make it for lunch thanks for sharing the recipe.
That's Lao Khua Mee, ( fried noodles ), original. Lol.
Baddie
I made this tonight and it was incredible! I will never eat takeout again now that I know how easy it is to make Asian food. Not to mention it tastes so much better! You're the best Seonkyong!
*OMG!!! THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE BEGINS TOMORROW!!!* ......... Okay, I feel better now. Nice video.
Try this sauce Seonkyoung for pad Thai!  -tamarind sauce w/real tamarind pulp. You can melt the tamarind pulp in hot water. -fish sauce -sugar/Palm sugar -soy sauce  -paprika powder  -chili powder Adjust the taste and if you want a little more sour tamarind soup powder!
I just can't find that damn preserved radish and tamarind consentrate!!  Uuhh so annoying lol
Thanks to you I've become a chef in my own kitchen hehehehe!! Mama always said a woman should know now to man her kitchen. Lol but my moms teaching was a dab of this and a shake of that. I could never catch on and my sauce was always off hahahahah
I'm Thai and your recipe and cooking very close to  mine even Paula Deen used tamarind juice ( that is for drinking not to cook Paula!), I'll keep watching your video.  I'll make mine someday :)
love your shirt
Do you know of any alternatives to fish sauce?
This is my go - to recipe when I want some pad thai. It really is killer pad thai.
Could not find preserved radish. Can i use pickled raddish instead. Thanks
I love this. Ive made it for the second time now and it always tyrn out delish. Thanks for the recipe. (Just finished making one now) X
Where did you get your plate from??
You explain and went into details(step by step) perfectly! 😊 Love it I will try   to make Pad Thai today for a very first time
U didn't add salt at all...😨
I love it very much..thank you
omfg how did you stir all that food without spilling im so jealous!!
My pad thai came out great but they looked a bit pale. What should I do to get that brown colour?
Tried this. Turned out very authentic. The husband loved it. Though I added some vinegar and lime juice to the sauce as well and didn't have radishes and I started off with some garlic. Turned out absolutely epic. Thank you !
What do you use to give it that red color ?
i didnt have the tamarind but it was delicioussss
Well Done Dear :-)
i am going to thailand in July, pattaya city (second road) area..i am going to try the best pad thai in pattaya ever again.Ohhhhh :-)
nooders
nooder!! lmao!
Seonkyoung, this is the second time I have made Pad Thai using your recipe.  It is absolutely the best.  My son says it is "beautiful".  I added yellow and orange bell peppers to the red ones for additional color but it is still excellent.  Thanks so much I love your channel.  Wahidah
Her tofu is not sounds right lol
when I was in Thailand they had a sauce on the side with chilies in it and also oneI believe with fish sauce, sugar, and maybe vinegar? Also dried chilies and another container with sugar. What is your guess for the two sauces? Anyone
What's the substitute for preserved sweet radish if I cannot find it in the store?
You're so cute!
this girl good for sleep every night
I love it 🍲
damn I am hungry watching this...
You're awesome :-)

mmmmmm yes i woke up needing pad thai today, looking forward to making it.
I love pad Thai!!!
Hi Mrs Longest, you've gained my subscription! I wonder where do you live? Where I live has Num Dae Mun a korean store in Smyrna, Georgia the suburb of Atlanta, which sells every thing- Mexican through Asian stuff. Your recipes are very inviting! Keep doing what you are doing!
The pad thai noodles sitting at my fridge made me watch this video this eventing...I ended up watching restaurant express videos till the last episode.  Enjoyed the intoxicating personality+ all the recipes which I will cherish over the coming years.
the sauce recipe I just used calls for soy sauce, peanut butter and Asian chili paste which wasn't bad at all. how could the recipes be so different?? I'll have to try this version
I got the munchies and doubt I could or be able to cook this. 😎
Omg i cant wait to try it out！
sounds heavenly can't wait to try it thank you!
Makes my mouth sooo watery ... i cant find the tamarin thing and the radish !!! Any other supplement please
so delicious  recipe
i've been looking everywhere for a good recipe of pad thai. I found your video and decided to give it a try today. I cooked for my friends and it was an instant hit! i'm so happy i found your channel. it was my first time making pad thai and it was literally the best pad thai i've ever had. Keep up the great work! i cant wait to try out your other recipes !
I've been saying siracha all wrong
The best❤️
Made pad thai last night but I want to make it again now :PPP
I just love it! 😀❤ yummm!
What if I don't have tamarind??? Can I substitute that with anything else ?
you make me hungry 😢😢😢 can't sleep tonight
Wow I'm Thai and this dish looks pretty good
It was way too salty for me, should I reduce the amount of fish sauce?
HELLO! Can I use tamarind stock instead of concentrate? I hope you reply. A big fan from PH here! :)
she makes it look so easy
wow.... look so good. it looks better then my Pad thai😂 and I am even A THAI😂
I am Thai and your Pad Thai Recipe is very good, similar to the original recipe. You understand this recipe wisely. I will follow your channel for sure.
thank you
awesome ! I love noodles :)
She makes it look so easy😭
I wanna taste your rice... อร่อย...😋
don't forget spring onions and basil
@Seonkyoung Longest. Thank you for showing me how to make this!! I appreciate the light hearted attitude and presentation of your videos!!! Excellent work! I hope for your success on Youtube in the future!

Good job. This is the very real pad Thai.
<<Black girl and use to making soul food but love to try new things. You make it so fun, easy, and realistic to make Asian dishes...Thankiesssss
She looks yummy as that pad thai!
I'm absorbing all this information like a sponge, but these videos are also making me hungry for this stuff lol Not really good when you're broke at 2 : 30am lol
yay!!! wee!!! =)
I tried and taste very good!
I am such a Pad Thai fiend. I love the flavor, but it HAS to have tamarind. You can taste the difference if it doesnt. Thid looks so so yummy. I gotta make my own tamarind paste but I can't wait to do it at home.
This is the best padthai made by a foreigner that ive seen so far. wow.
Hi there! Any replacement for the radish? 😄
Pad Thai is always bland & no spice. There is so much better Thai food out there.
Thank you for sharing REAL pad thai. Anyway if you can add some dried shrimp, it is more delicious.
I'm Thai and I cook. I approve of this recipe. This is the most legit recipe that foreigner does.
I love her!!
정말 맛있어 보여요!
발음이 귀여우세요^^
I absolutely love you! I love how you teach us to cook these delicious recipes. I have search for true pad Thai and this is the first that sounds like my husband's favorite. Thank you!!! 😘💋🌸😃🌸
😋 I ❤️❤️❤️Pad Thai. The best one I had was the one in Phuket. I've been to a lot of Thai Restaurant here in the 🇺🇸 but nothing can compare and you are cute too. I introduced this dish to my kids and they ❤️it too and ask me "Mom, why can't you make one for us?" and I told 'em, "it seems complicated to make that." Until I saw this video of yours. 👍🏼
congratulations to your husband on a amazing wife he has ,gorgeous on the outside and inside and she can cook ,what more does a good man needs

I've watched so many recipes on Pad Thai, and this is definitely my favorite!
Thank you Ms.  I will try this Thai Noodle  Can u please share how to cook Thai Spicy Soup (Not Tom Yum) with Fried Chicken and Pork Neck Salad that I tried in Bangkok. These are my super favorites :) :)
Im thai ,this recipe is really good and correct !!! I saw many pad thai recipe on youtube but This one is real traditional pad thai . Trust me 👍🏻
This is authentic Pad Thai. I'm Thai and I confirm this.
hi lovely Seon. made ur recipe phad thai...not once but twice YUM! how can we make it look darker...my tamarind concentrate not as dark as urs.
3:43 when did you make this dish ? that tamarind has expired on march 2016 and you upload it on april 2016. just a reminder
I'm Thai, and I'm here to insist this recipe is real! Yeah! Try it everyone. You can't miss this recipe.
I made this one.. without the radish and it still  delicious... my husband love it and keeps requesting this food.. thank you for sharing...
Oh my gosh! Definitely going to try with my hubs this weekend!! Thank you for the very easy directions!!!
I'm Thai and this looks amazing!! I've heard what is going on with your house and I wanna sayy fighting!!
That looks delicious! I'll be sure to give it a try.
looks so good
I love this. I'm gonna try this.
You are adorable and I love your recipes.  Thank you!
I hard difficulty making out what she said.. but any how.. I am Thai.. and pad Thai is not supposed to be dark like that. It's supposed to have a pale'ish color...
We made your Pad Thai tonight!  It was delicious!!  Your recipes always come our great for me.  Thank you for sharing them with us!!  Hugs and kisses from your fan...  :)
I believe this is very authentic recipe.  The only thing I would do different is cook the already cooked meat with the noodles so the meet is not bland.  and I add dried small shrimps.  but looks delicious
Going try this at the weekend looks so nice
Hey, thank you for lovely recipe. I made it at home and it was almost perfect. May be use slightly less palm sugar and add bit of garlic. Thank you again for sharing a great recipe.
Love your recipes, they're easy to do, unfortunately its hard to find some authentic asian ingredients here in Dubai...nonetheless i watch and try to cook some of your dishes. Love your channel!
Great video! I would love to see a recipe for another restaurant/take away classic - Singapore Noodles. I don't think I've seen you do that recipe before, and would love your take!
You are so beautiful! I love your eyes and hands. Very very gorgeous. Your husband is so lucky. Thank you, the recipes are delicious. I love your kimchi.

Great videos! This pad thai looks amazing!
Looks fantastic!
Great Video and ill give your recipe a go as its different to mine, but as a side note i noticed that you do the same as me and you were mainly "tossing the Noodles" to preserve the noodle instead of "folding" like most westerners would do and end up breaking the noodles into tiny bits.
Oh my gosh, you cook like a pro. Your ingredients for Pad Thai and the way you cook it is very very spot on...just like we cook in Thailand. Great job! I'm just subscribe to your channel yesterday and I am glad I did!
I enjoy doing  video recipes myself to inspire others, but I also enjoy watching others as well, thanks for sharing!
My mouth is watering right now. Glad we have an Asian market down the street. I know they will have the ingredients I need. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. Pad Thai is my favorite!

Hi Seonkyoung! Love love channel!!! Please keep the videos coming!!!  Btw, what kitchen knife do you use? Maybe you should make a video for "must have" kitchen tools ?
Will you marry me? :o
NO
This looks so delicious and easy...will be making this for the kids tomorrow.
Thanks so much for the recipe!  What wok do you use?  :)
I can't wait to try this!
I like your Pad Thai recipe. One question though, do you just eyeball the amount of Tamarind and then adjust to taste? I learned by trial and error. Gonna try your version this weekend with some friends.
Is there any substitute for fish sauce?
I made a vegan version of this recipe (no meat no egg, vegan fish sauce instead, but everything else the same) and it turned out really good!! Except I found that 2TBSP sugar was too sweet for my taste so I would recommend using 1.5 TBSP, tasting, then add more if u want it sweeter. It was pretty easy to make!
I think this might be the most wonderful YouTube channel I've ever discovered. :)
if i cant find the tamarind concentrate, what can i substitue of that?
You are so cute! And the food looks delicious ^^
that looooks amazing! drooling at night..
Awesome! Thank you for these easy pad thai recipe! So good and so easy!

I like your videos. You make it fun and easy!!!!I'm hungry now and there's not a good Pad Thai place here in NO. There's a great one on Sacramento and Kearny in SF but that is soooo far away from here! I just have to make your recipe!!!!!!!!
Wow. Thai is REAL Padthai. Im Thai I can say. Ingredient and method is right!
i wonder if she still works at the restaurant in Las vegas
What kind of wok do you use? I am going to buy one soon and I'd like one that is non-stick like yours! It looks like a good size.

This is a right way of cooking Pad Thai like Thais! I give u thumbs-up.
Hi Seonkyoung! You forgot one important step to making a great Pad Thai. You have to char the noodles to give off the authentic aroma and taste. But well done!
Merci pour votre recette.👍
wow you got right ingredients !!!  nice cooking :)
Awesome wok skill
Collaborate with Maangchi you both are amazing at cooking Asian and Korean foods
Oh thx! ...i enjoy the great food.
i am Thai , and i guarantee Seonkyoung's Pad Thai is really awesome !!
Yay I'm so glad I found your channel. I will make this tomorrow!
great look's yummy thanks.
You are truly a wonderful cook! As I've always struggled with making Pad Thai, thank you for posting this recipe. 😍
terrible. yoghurt is a importance ingredient too. thanks I try it. because it's easy. all asian languages are under sound normal, can not sell;-)
I love the way you eat and I love your recipes so much! They always turn out amazing!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!!
Yummmyyy..^_^
Hi where did you get your dinner plates? I've  been looking for them ever scene i went to a dinner party at a neighbor's house but I can't find them, I love the way they are shaped. Thanks
It looks really similar to kwetiau. The differences are we only use sweet soy sauce, fried shallot, garlic, green onions, chives, meat & egg. You should try it! it's really good. there are other variations like kwetiau in soup & thick sauce.
recipes,  not reservations lol.......spell check not working hahaha
love this!! you are always on point with your reservation recipes,  my family and I love pad thai
love love love this stuff..
Pon subtítulos!!! por favor
Hi Seonkyoung and Jacob..I found your channel about 5 hours ago, and I'm probably your newest subscriber. I just finished a viewing marathon of your videos and found them to be so great, entertaining and addictive. I especially love your travel food vlogs. Are you going to be traveling to Korea again? I hope so, Korea looks fantastic! Keep up your great work.  I'll continue watching more videos tomorrows as its late now and have to work tomorrow.. PS. My wife and I want to say that you and Jacob look like your meant for each other, you make a great couple..! Cheers. Sam

Any Life in Cali coming soon ?? I prefer food vlog😂😂
The palm sugar I have is in solid form. I had a hard time getting it to mix with my sauce. Any ideas on how to get it to mix in better?

I'm so glad you used tamarind. I get so mad when I see people post pad thai recipes without tamarind. Then they feel justified when I bring it up.
