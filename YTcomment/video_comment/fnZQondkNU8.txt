Great video!  In Hawaii, datemaki costs over $14, so decided to make it for the upcoming oshogatsu.  Couldn't find hanpen here so I was going to use surimi from Chinatown, but finally found it at Nijiya Market at Ala Moana Center.  They just moved into a new location so you should do a video there on your next visit of Hawaii.  Thanks!!!
Does anyone know the music at 3:03? Please let me know. I have been searching for it for a long time now. I REALLY love it a lot 💖
What a coincidence, my name is Satoshi too. Can you use fishcake too, you know the pink and white roll? I have plenty of that at my market. Thank you.
Doesn't really mention if it's necessary... anyone know if this will work in a silicon pan without the parchment paper?
Is it okay if I put the plastic wrap part on the sushi mat before rolling? So I don't have to wash the sushi mat.. Hahaha
Is there a vegetarian version of this? I really want to make this, but without seafood. I heard you can make this with tofu?
Is there a vegetarian alternative to the hanten?
I love this presentation!
昨日この動画を探して見直したばっかりなんですよ😃今日のライブ配信は実家でおせち作ってるので（この伊達巻も作ります👍）参加できそうにないんですが後から見ます✨良いお年をお迎えください🎍
Nope nope nope, sweet omelets were like the only thing I didn't like in Japan. I mean to each his own, just not for me lol
Satoshi: Hey everyone I'm Satoshi   Shinichi: And I'm Satoshi -laughs-   Satoshi: -glares at him" LOL   By the way what is hanpen?
there's 2 satoshis lols😂😂
Thanks Guys. I allways wondered how to make this. This inspires me to try it out myself. And Satoshi, i hope you are well after your viral infection.
Satoshi's face at the beginning was priceless (I apologize if I spelt your name incorrectly)
Don't you guys eat soba on New Year's Eve? Or is this only in the anime shows?
Red and green kanten.  Always look forward to that at New Years
This is a off the wall question but are you Satoshi a couple?  Just curious, no need to answer if you don't want to.
Why do you need sugar and honey?? Why not just one or the other?
two satoshis jajajajajajajja
I am now! I think I'll head over to Chinatown and see if they carry hanpen or just buy fresh shrimp.
Does it taste similar to the sweet tamagoyaki in bentos ?
what is hanpen???
you guys! so sweet! no other words. big thumbs up!!! if you are in germany sometime, visit Münster in north rhine-westphalia. it is also callled "the capital of bicycles" in Germany. i bet you would enjoy it. and if you should, pm me. it would be  a pleasure, for me to show you around and eat the hell out of it. ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Dc4akN10sI
Hey Mr. Wong, I recently saw that your clothing ad got placed on my video and it increased my revenue a bit. Wether it was intentional or YouTube's algorithms, I decided to seek you out and thank you. ^_^ if you want I can start throwing in ads to your shop.
SO CLOSE TO 100,000! Can we make it there? We can do this people
Hi Satoshi and Shinichi! You should talk about the significance of datemaki. Many of the Osechi items have meanings other than just being something to eat. In the case of datemaki, it is rolled. The roll represents a rolled up scroll. Datemaki symbolizes scholarly pursuits.
Beautiful !
I don't know if you guys are gonna see this but it was cool seeing you guys in little Tokyo I wish I could have gotten a picture with you guys
Can you use silken tofu instead of hanpen?
could you guys please make a video with all your bloopers? you guys are so much fun 😊
*Tasty View.  Pleasant Evening.*
honestly waiting  for a fight to happen between you guys ✌
Looks really good!! I have eaten before, but never realized there was fish inside interesting!
I simply loved everything about this video!!
what is hanpen?
omg! I wish it was New Years now! so glad you showed this recipe. It's one of my favorite! we always have that at new years... next to all the varieties of kamaboko. I never knew it was also made from fish. My absolute favorite, tho, is Ozoni. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the crispy mochi and all the japanese vegetables... ok, maybe not so much konnyaku! Can't wait to see more of your New Years recipes!
JAPANESE DISHES🍶🍨🍮🍳🍲🍱🍣🍤🍖🍘🍡🍢🍥🍛🍚🍙🍜😮
what if i don't have hapen to make datemaki?
Sinichi!!!!! What does the orange shirt say pls!!!!! ?
Oishiiii!!!! I love New Years dish!!!!!!! I lovvvvvvvvve sweet black beans!!!!!!
Wow..so pretty and delicious
Here in California osechi is very expensive. You have removed much of the mystery of this one item. Mucho thanks 😉
Is it possible to use kamaboko instead of hanpen?
That's the prettiest datemaki I've ever seen! Thanks for another great recipe!  Yes, I'm such a big fan of osechi ryori. I've recently realized how much effort my mom puts into it, and I want to learn how to make the traditional dishes. My favorite is my mom's sunomono with renkon, yamaimo, ginger, and carrots. It's crunchy, refreshing, sweet, and tart. I always get nostalgic whenever she makes it.   Have a great weekend, Satoshi and Satoshi!
I am really curious to know what standing the roll up vertically at the end contributes to this dish.
oh! always wondered how to make this! it looks so tasty! when you say just use white fish, should we blend it for a bit before adding everything or just toss it in with everything in chunks? ty for the great video!
Can i use fish cake instead?
The production quality of this video is very good.
Hahahaha... The opening is so funny....  I really really love eggs dishes. Thanks for sharing~ <3
I am not confident that I will receive a reply, however, I need to ask a question which I hope someone can help me find an answer to. I do not eat meat...including seafood of any type. What can I use as a alternative... instead of fish? Tofu? Maybe? Two of my sons are vegetarian as well...their choice, I did not force vegetarianism on them. It would be strange to watch my other three sons eat this...with fish. Any help/advice would be gratefully received...
What an interesting dish! I'd love to know the traditional New Years dishes and try to make some for my family for the New Year
New York から見ています。英語と料理の勉強を同時に出来るのでTabiEatsさんの動画大好きです！おせち、買いたいけど高い($400~$500)…自分で作るには難しい…😭と思っていたら、素敵な動画でわかりやすく説明されていたので、やってみようかな！と思いました。次の動画も楽しみに待ってます。
YAYYY I've been looking forward to this recipe since your Facebook preview picture! This is such an interesting dish and so uniquely Japanese, really hope I'll get to taste it one day!!😍 Also sooo happy for you my friends, so close to 100k!!👏🏻👏🏻
love your videos awesome video take care
The production was stunning!  Absolutely stunning. Can you give the name of the music? I enjoyed that a lot. I can only imagine the taste of the  Datemaki. The combinations of ingredients are unusual in our neighborhood, that is for sure. I would love to try it!  (Don't worry Shinichi, I forget who I am on occasion also. But then, I'm a lot older than you!) As always guys, a wonderful time spent with you two!
the mix up in the beginning and satoshis reaction lol
Is this similar to tomagoyaki? I love making that!
Love this!!!!! Omg
Live the back ground music!!!!!! As well as the video
Looks wonderful!!!
Great video guys! I just ran into you in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. :) Cheers!
Just a quick question, What is Hanpen actually? i have never heard of it and i know that you said that this one was made with fish, but it definitely looks intriguing. Thanks for a great video!
this it have a reason it have to stand?    bye the way I really love your videos 😊 best wishes from Germany 😊
Nice Music !
Name of the first song, please??
I am Satoshi too!  Hahaha.  This is a dish I will definitely make this week.  I read online that hanpen is a type of surimi made of white fish, so besides white fish or shrimp, could it also be made with imitation crab surimi?
Hahahaha you guys are so cute 😍
Looks so delicious!
What is Mirin?
looks like a really delicious dish..   I wish I good make it, looks very easy..  but the problem is we don't have hanpen in our country  or rather never heard of it before so probably we don't have it..  anyway it looks like tofu but probably not..  what is hanpen by the way???
I have never had any Japanese new year food. Would love to though, and even though it has fish I would try this cause it looks delicious. Arigatou Gozaimasu😱😋🙇
Guys, I just marvel at your great videography! It's arrestingly beautiful! Very well done! And of course the datemaki looks irresistible! Great job!
I like this! But I had never thought I cook it  myself.
I would like to see something colorful! The new years video you did last year was so nice. I want shinichi to secretly film satoshi making the osechi...don't tell him I said this
hanpen is not sold at my country is there a way i can make it my self?
It looks so delicious...........
it looks really beautiful!!! supa nice recipe,gonna try that soon(-_^)
Yes!  I am a fan of New Year's dishes!  My favorite New Year's dish is ozoni.  Thanks for this video. It looks delicious.  I haven't had this before, but I want to try it.  Have a great weekend!  :-)
I love it! I am a fan of this now that I've seen it made. You both make food in such a graceful way. Beautiful and thank you.
beautiful!
You mentioned the price for the supermarket variety, yet didn't mention how much, even if it's a rough estimate, this costs to make. I assume it's a lot cheaper, but I just wanna see how much cheaper. Thank you.
100K subs by Christmas? Wishing you guys the best! :D
No waaaaayyyy!!!!  Guys!!!  I am SO excited to try this recipe!!  Thank you for doing this!  Datemaki is one of my favorites as well, but like you'd mentioned.....it's so expensive!  Now.....if I can just get my hands on some hanpen.  I'm going to go to Tokyo Central/Marukai and see if they have it.  If I can't, you mentioned white fish.  Would it be possible to use Surimi?
It looks like I want it so bad... T-T
the opening was so funny. the best was satoshi s Impression
意外と簡単そうかも！ 大好きでいつも消費が早いから来年は作っちゃおうかな(● ˃̶͈̀ロ˂̶͈́)੭ꠥ⁾⁾
that looks delicious my friends
the opening was funny. hahaha... i laughed out loud. thx guys for making my day. ❤ from malaysia.
hello everybody this is satoshi...i am satoshi 😂😂😂
I love the cooking videos :D
栗金団も作ってほしいです！
You guys are so awesome : ) For 3 years now I want to visit Japan when I turn 19 because I want to see the people, architecture, food and culture. For me everything seems perfect there and both of you prove me right : ) So friendly, interesting and entertaining <3
Yum!!!!
(never too early to say) happy new year!  i'm a new subscriber living in japan and your cooking videos have really inspired me to try cooking new dishes! thank you for the lovely videos!
Premium grade ahi tuna is my favorite Japanese New Year tradition.  I lived in Hawaii for 15 years and just love ahi poke'.  But, the price of ahi goes crazy at New Year's.
lmao how exactly does one forget their own name?
Loving the cooking vids :D
