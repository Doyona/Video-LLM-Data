Well, using a drywall anchor is probably a very elementary thing but no-one ever explains it and I have been completely intimidated from doing so many things because I didn't know how it was done, and am so grateful for your video explaining it in such basic and clear terms! I actually feel kind of relieved, I can definitely go places after this.
Thank you for helping all of us be more independent!
Thank you for this video.
Thank you. My apartment walls are made of horsehair plaster, so doing anything to the walls is a huge pain.
That’s what the internet was made for
Hello, What if I'm using plastic anchors and they keep breaking because I can't get them all the way in? Using these have been frustrating to install but giving them another try.    Do I need to purchase a shorter anchor or a metal one instead of the ones that come with the screws? I'm trying to install a curtain rod bracket.
Thank you so much for this video. I had no idea how to use these. Never understood it.
This is a terrible angle
Good video. Only thing I would add is what size drill bit are you using to make the hole for the drywall anchor
This is my favorite video on YouTube
Thank you for this straightforward easy to understand video. Though in the comments, I’m not sure  why there so many references to men.  Last I checked…. Nails, hammers, drillbits, tools have no idea what gender is installing them.🤔
I'm a 33 year old mom... I had a drug addict, alcoholic mother, and just left a controlling relationship. I'm learning how to be an adult. Thank you!
The screws supplied with the hanger are too short and too slim to work,thanks Temu. 84 year old standing on a chair trying to rehang a  rod, the hanger that came with it from Walmart was too flimsy to hold the rod and  the medium weight curtain.These companys cheap out all the time
This video is ten years old and it is helping me now. Thank you for not taking this video down. It was simple and made the process less intimidating.
No dad (ever), no brothers, no spouse or BD. Turning 69 next month, and thanks to your video, I now have new curtain rods and beautiful 96" long curtains in my LR. THANKS SO MUCH!! And thanks to YouTube as well. Last month I successfully tore out my hideous kitchen floor and laid down a new one.
Thank you!!!
Pro tip: IF you hit too hard with the hammer your going to bend the plastic dry wall anchor, and it will become useless. I push them in with my thumbs, if they don't push in easy, then make a tad bigger hole.
ISn't it cute when women do a man's DIY at home :)
This was helpful and I appreciate it, but I was specifically looking for info on what size drill bit to choose.
Wow, a 10 year old video has elaborated so well on how to install a curtain anchor. Many thanks ❤❤
Thank you this helped me very much!
Thank you! I recommend leveling your bracket next time so you can be certain you've got the second screw in the right place. Your video was very helpful.
Very informative! Thanks.
I needed this tutorial 2yrs ago but I suppose I used the wrong keywords at the time. Found you by asking “how to use the plastic on Sheetrock” vs how to hang curtains.  Best demo around… thank you!
What diameter has to be drilled? Is it same as the front side of the anchor?
Ahh thank you.. I notice nice old door mouldings and higher ceilings. Used to be the norm. Now apparently we have less sky?
Thank you so much for explaining how to install the drywall screws. I bought rods and these screws came with it but I didn't know what to do with them. But I'll have to get a drill now.😊
I came looking to i.d. the correct drill bit size and this doesn't cover that; will look elsewhere..
This helped a lot, thanks!
Why need dry wall plug??? screw it will.holld
Thank you for making this short video to explain this.  Every time I ask my husband to just teach me "how" he takes it and does it or says not to touch anything until he gets home.  This was so easy to understand,  I never knew I was supposed to Hammer those plastic things in, I've always tried to screw them in together somehow and give up. Thank you
Finally! Someone who actually explains the drywall anchor 😂😊
I went through FIVE other videos that weren’t helpful until I came across yours. Thank you so much! I’m off to do my project with more confidence now.
Your video lacks confidence, you hesitate on basic terminology like “screw” and you admit you’re not good at using a drill then back it up by drilling at a 45 degree downward angle. What a HORRIBLE video.
I drilled it in before I watched⚰️
I only wanted to know what size drill bit to use. That info was never shared. Good video otherwise.
Thank you!! Seeing a woman like me do it is also giving me the confidence to try myself!
This was excellent with simple detailed instructions. Thank you!
Grateful for this. Kinda forgot how to do these little things
I don’t have a drill!
Majority of the anchors i attempt to install seem to smash and bend so easily when i hammer them in. Even being gentle. I've always only used anchors that come with the particular project. Wondering if there are higher quality anchors that wouldn't smash so easily
thanks so muchhhhh
Great video simple and showed us step by step thank you
This video was exactly what I was looking for! Had wanted to see what happens when the screw goes into the anchor to make sure I was following the instructions correctly.
This was awesome...so informative...tk u 🪷
Thank you so much this was very helpful
I was hoping you showed the drill but you used. That seems a little important.. I guess I will wing it and I will probably be alright. Thanks
You're awesome!!! Thanks girl!
Why so high 3 inches then four
How do you know what size drill bit to use?
Can anyone help me? My anchor won’t go all the way into the wall and I’ve gotten the smallest size.
Ty!😊
Best video I have seen on how to use the anchor thank you
Or if I wasn’t using a level I’d put the top one in first and then straighten the bottom - I can see your mount is not aligned
I’d be using a vertical and horizontal level
how do you decide the size of drill bit?
I wish I would’ve seen this video b4 putting holes in my wall 😫🤦🏾‍♀️
Very helpful.  Thank you.
Thank you so much for this, it helped me today❤️💫
My sink always bends. She hammered it in like it was nothing
Best tutorial on how to put up curtains rods by far thank you
😊😊😊thanks
Do these black Screws damage the screwdriver tips?
Thank you for this video. I'm putting up curtains and the instructions says to use anchors for drywall. I didn't know what that was. This video is so helpful.
You must be a woman
Perfect tutorial-- thank you! Now I feel like I can do it all by myself :).
I've generally hated relying on wall anchors and opt for finding the studs, but a recent project necessitated that I use them. This made it easier.
I don’t care about what you are putting up just show me how to install the anchor . THATS WHAT I WANT . Waste of time
I have a packet of dry wall anchors and screws. No numbers available. She needs to explain how to determine the size of drill bit by size of anchor.
Clear & Concise 👍🏾
Starts 2:14
God damn why are my anchor such shit. They won't go in the damn wall
too bad can't see where the drill is drilling because of the camera angle.
These don't work at all, the screw can't even be screwed in using a drill
Exactly what I was looking for thanks
Omg ... thank you! #Grrlpower.
Marvelous
My nephew pulled the curtain so the rod came too.  My house previous owner didn't use anchor for drywall so I'm now watching your video to get an idea.  Thanks
failed.put a massive hole in the wall and the hardware fell through. My mom yelled at me. 6/10
Great job i am going to do this right now for a closet rod. Will carry a lot of weight.
You hammered that anchor in without it bending and breaking. Every time I do it the plastic anchor bends and then becomes completely useless. Any easier way to get them in without bending and breaking it?
Why is listening to female explain this easier to understand then my dad and boyfriend lolol
Well, I've been waiting two weeks for my husband to find enough "time" to hang my new craft room bulletin board, so decided to find a YouTube on how to do it myself.  This is just the ticket!
Thank You!
You should probably get familiar with the tools and technologies first...
Thanks
I didn't know how to use the hollow wall anchors and always avoided them until today! Thank you so much for such a clear step by step presentation!  I had already used nails and my shelf was falling immediately.  I just used a phillips head screwdriver and carefully twisted it back and forth in the nail holes and made perfect holes for the wall anchors. It took about 10 minutes and I was done and so happy!  Thank you again
I am a very lucky man who is the father of a beautiful young lady Who I pray is going to be as independent and handy as you are and we'll making her own YouTube diy
Wonderful to have a lady handy with tools versus a men  Thank you so much We women really need this advantage 🙏👍
THANK YOU!
This was very helpful to me! Thank you so much! I must admit though I am not sure if I  have a combination drill and screw drill. I have used the screw parts for building furniture.  I am guessing the smaller pointy ones are drills? Sorry if this is a dumb question . Do you use the smallest one?
Great video beautiful hands and thanks for making it easy.
How big of a drill bit?
Can you use a hammer?
Hi what is call the little you put before you did the bracket you said it gonna get the drill go more far in plz and thanks
This video is 1.5x better at 1.5x speed.
Thanks for this video, it is so simple but many are intimidated by this. You made it and showed how it easy it is.
You are the first person who explained this step by step!  Thank you!  I followed other videos but they never were so detailed.  Because of that I have messed up and have to fix the wall.  NOW I can get this done and hang up my new towel rack!
Thank you!!!!  Been doing all kinds of projects all my life, never used these. Thank you.
Thank you so much! This was very helpful!
Thank you so much, sis!
This is one of those things that most people assume others to already know and typically no one teaches. Thank you so much for teaching me how to do this properly!! 😇
Thank you so much! I try to be independent and a DIYer when I can, but I didn’t have parents to show me how to do little things like this. Drywall anchors have always been intimidating and confusing! Thank you for being so patient and concise in your explanation, I just hung a gallery wall of art and a bunch of shelves! Thank you thank you!
I know it’s 8 years later but…..this was a very good video! Well done!
I tried this and the anchor just goes deeper with the screw. I used a hammer to push them in too at first.
Oh my gosh thank you! I get these in every package with something that has screws and I’ve always wondered what the heck they were for 😂 now I understand how people hang things in drywall. Mystery solved.
Is the plastic supposed to be drilled in the wall?
Thank you for the examples.  It really helped me today with putting up my toilet paper holder.  I've called maintenance to do it several times, Del-Rey Village Apartments maintenance is horrible and half-ass does things, and it kept falling out.  Now I will anchor it myself.  Thank you.
Thank you for the video!! I just moved in to my place and I been kinda scared to hang anything and I didn't wanna ask anyone so this was just so helpful!
what drill bit a size do you use for different size anchors. what is the length or how deep should you go in. the anchor looks bigger than the screw so how will anchor fit into hole.
This is a super helpful demonstration, thank you!
I’ve been watching so many of these videos and a girl explained it better than most guys! Thank you!
Thank you so much!
epic
Thank you ❤️
This helped tremendously as this was my first time! Short and to the point! Many thanks!
Thank you for this video. As a suggestion for the next, put the camera in an angle that the drill or hammer won’t cover what you are doing, this could be helpful as well
The drywall anchor just bends when you hammer it.
Thanx so much for this video.  Was intimidated by the process but you did a fine job of explaining!  Thanx so much!!
Is there a certain drill bit or screw driver that should be used so the screw doesn’t break apart where you screw it in?
How do you know what size drill bit to use?
Thanks! My teen daughter and I watched this together today and now she's in her room with wall anchors and a drill putting up her own wall art!  :)  Nice that the first video that popped up was a woman showing us how to do this.
Very helpful!
Too much talk.
Praise the Lord we don't get pap smears like this bit
Fat
Thank you! It’s very frustrating always depending on a man to do things for me, so I figured I could just learn how to do it myself!
So how do I do this without a drill
Still watching. but thanking you in advance... your video and demo is perfect for me.
Thanks for this!
Thank you for posting!!
Thank you. I’ve always been intimidated by this. I appreciate your step by step.
I appreciate this video, but I'm wondering how do you know how much bigger or small the bit that you're using in correlation to the size of the anchor. How do you decide?
I’m using the same anchor as you in the video but mine keeps bending when I try to gently hammer it into the wall. Any solutions?
Thank you
Thankyou! Exactly what I needed to know.
Thank you for the concise instructions.
Thank you!!! All the other videos I looked at before this one had the person's hands covering what they were actually doing. 😂
I should’ve watched this video before i drilled a bunch of hole in my wall 😹😹
Thank you! My husband is a carpenter and won’t put up my curtain rod bracket. He’s away, so I’m doing it while he’s gone.  There ya go.
You didn't say anything about what size drill bit to use.
omgg thx so much i went from knowing nothing about drills and now i know a little bit
I'm late to the party, but ty so much I was able to put up curtains for my mom. She always says "we need husbands" when we have projects like this. I dont need a husband to put in a drywall screw lol. Thanks to this video and the helpful comments I did it myself, thank you👏🏽!
Girl thankyou
This is extremely helpful.  The studs never seem to be in spots that will work for where I want my shelves and I never fully understood how these worked.
You introduced the drywall anchor but didn't actually use it. I don't get it???????
Thanks girl. I watched so many men’s videos and they were all useless. They missed the point and failed to explain how these work. ❤️
I really wish my previous homeowner used this guide...
Pro tip:   Use a Molly, if you haven’t got a stud. These plastic anchors are worthless if you are expecting to support more than feather weight.
I can now hang my coat hooks without waiting for my husband to do it. 👏🏻
Just exactly what I'm looking for as a women trying to install some new furniture in home. Thanx a lot. Xoxo
Very helpful 😊 thank you
Use cardboard to make a template for hanging curtains it works so well.
Thank you so much for explaining and showing so clearly how it is done.
I already know how to use them, but I want to make sure I don’t screw up.
Not a great information or how-to video. B+ for effort, though.
Wish I saw this before I pounded 4 huge gaping holes in my wall cause I couldn't figure it out and didn't realize a hammer was a big no no for drywall 🤦🏿‍♀️ didn't even know I had drywall 😅
What size drill bit is most common??
Helping my sister get her new practice together. This is going to come in handy. THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!!
Honestly one of the best help videos I’ve seen. No filler no nothing you just explained it simple and well, I thank you for your helpfulness.
nice hands on my c
I did exactly this but my screw did not go all the way in for some reason 😐 now the screw head is damaged because I used the wrong bit and I can't remove it😣
That drill sounds like its gonna explode at any point
Almost broke my wall. But I did it 😭
Thank you! Short, sweet and spot on!
Adorable
👏
Thank you. Very helpful in my current project. 🌸
Thanks girl ✊🏽
Come on man.. you didn't mention the relative size of drill bit used in relation to anchor, and drywall hole... that's the important part..
young girl in my own first apartment with no dad or brothers. this was so helpful. thank u
Thank you so much!!
Thank you for your instructions. Just mounted a key-holder. Thank you again!
THANK U
What size drill bit do you use to drill the hole for the plastic thing to go into?
Size of drill bit?
Thank you so much
Here is a video which explains how to determine the right drill bit to use for your dry wall anchor when the screw size is not specified in the installation hardware packet:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29Eq96c1dOc
I just put up my curtain rods following your tutorial, and oh my goodness, it worked so amazing!! Thank you so much!!
Thank you! Just bought a curtain rod that came with these anchors for the first time, and my "instruction" paper doesn't tell me what to do with them or how to even use them. This was very helpful 🙂
Thank you for making this video it helped me a lot ❤️
What size drill bit
Thanks to this excellent video, I easily installed my new shower curtain with drywall anchors.
thank you
Thank you
Jesus christ.... why is this video 4 min long. Just a complete waste
Thank you for sharing. I never understood what the drywall thing was for and literally no idea how to use it. Also thanks for keeping your videos simple bc that's exactly what I needed. Now I can use the anchor's I have correctly without damaging my walls. :)
Thank you so much!
Thank you for your clear, concise, show as you go instructions. Some of us are new DIYers and appreciate simplicity 👍🏼
Thank you for sharing
I watched your video and I thought I knew what I was doing and I did but I'm trying to hang a curtain rod in a mobile home and the anchors aren't working. They're not separating inside the wall like their supposed to  so I can't get my curtain rod up. Thank you for the video to verify I knew what I was doing.
I didn’t know you pounded the little sleeves in. Thank you!
Thanku for this. It seems so simple but ive never actually known how to do it.
Since my husband passed away, I was scared to take on jobs in my home that I just watched him do.  This video was a life saver for me! I am so pleased you had shown us.
My dad never got the chance to teach me this, I’m very grateful to learn it from you :)
How do you pick the size of the drill bit? Seems like a major point to just skip over.
I just tried that and the anchor  folded and broke.
😊
7 years later ...still helpful, 1st home, 1st project and you made it a little easier , GOD bless you
Thank you
I'm confused, where does the white cover go?? What's the point of it...
Thank you I always thought these things were completely worthless, turns out Drywall Anchors really do work if you just watch a tutorial and follow it.
Thanks 🙏
AUGUST 16th, 2021...
Which drill bit am I using for mine?
WHAT IF I DONT HAVE DRILL
Sweet and simple. Thanks.
Way to much info and lacking critical steps.
Thank you! I finally stopped asking my dad for help hanging things but drywall anchors were still intimidating!
Good video never knew how to use these things thanks!
Okay…so the anchors were metal not plastic, right? Thanks
Did I miss something? Lol. Did she not use the anchor for the screw? I have difficulty so when I use hammer for the plastic anchor and then put screw in anchor the anchor doesn’t get flush against wall. Any help? Thanks in advance!
I will try to do it with Woodprix plans.
Thank you and good job! I had to look for a woman to show me!! Lol all the other channels had no information, but instead how to put the rod together lol thank you girlfriend.
How do you decide which size drill bit to use?
This is a great video, but I tried to put up curtains using the wall anchors and the correct drill bit and when I put the anchors in it didn't go in all the way and the more I hammered, the more it would squish and i would have to pull it out and try again. UGH.
Hello, I am quite new to this. For this did you find a stud in the dry wall first and drill on that or you went without it? Thanks :)
thank you for this video!  us women arent good at stuff like this.  we are better at entertaining men (what we are designed to do).  thanks again.
Thank you so much for this video
Thank you
Thank you.  This has been quite helpful.
Minute and 20 seconds already have a full understanding. Great video
Bro I thought Daft Punk was playing in the beginning
You need to get to the point faster.
Thank you! So helpful.
heck that was catchy
Great video, thanks for the info an demonstration!
I measured the right distance apart, eyeballing the distance from the floor/ceiling. My drill bit was too short and I drilled a nice bigger hole on wall.  The other one the metal screw went too deep. Couldn't unscrew it out, so pushed it in farther and put another plastic piece in and screwed in the metal screw.  Hung my picture but it was slightly crooked.  O well.  Will do better next time.
Omggg this video just helped me put up my curtains and I’m so excited lol I literally felt so dumb cuz I couldn’t figure out how to use the wall anchors
Thank you 😊
Thank you :) I had no idea what to do with the plastic thing and I tried to just put the screws into the wall out of impatience and ignorance.
THANKS
Is the drill bit the same size as the screw or the anchor? It doesn't the anchor add to the mm size?
Thank you so much for making this video! I have watched so many videos this morning trying to figure out how to hang my curtain anchors. This is by far the most informative video.
Sweet..thanks handy girl
Is there a way to do this without a drill 😕😕
Thanks for the refresher. I was looking for the drill bit size to use.  FYI- when you want to take the anchors out. I learned an easy trick. Remove the screw ⅔ of the wall out and then pull it out with the hammer claw. The wings come back together and don’t make a huge hole.  I used to hammer them into the wall and speckle over them-lol.  This is much easier.  Try it!  I was amazed!
Adding this to a playlist called videos that changed my life. Ty mam
This was super helpful! Thank you so much :)
My mom keeps getting mad whenever i ask her for help with these, ive had floating shelfs on my floor for 3 months waiting to help her with this. But im doing it myself, im tired of these shelves floating around
I have some floating shelves i wanna install but i have Sheetrock in my bathroom. Would i still need these?
My issue is when I pound the drywall anchor in, it starts to bend...
Thank you for this video! I’ve always been intimidated by anchors and simply skipped them most of the time. Today I conquered my fear and installed a magnetic knife bar!
the most helpful info thx first time doin it for my Curio Cabinet to be secured on the wall in case it gets over packed inside
So, to sum up; once you've measured and marked your holes, insert the anchor, tap it in, then screw in the screw.
Thanks for demonstrating how the anchor actually works—very helpful and now I understand why they’re important! Now off to install my floating vanity...
Thank you. I was destroying my walls.
how do you know how wide the drill whole should be
Very helpful, thanks!
Great video! Thanks :))
I’m a builder and I was looking for a vid on tiling and came across this by accident but initially let it play with a chauvanistic rye smile but as I watched I thought fair play to all the house wives having a go at home good on you guys this video is so well explained to the absolute beginner and probably helps loads of people.    Well done
thanks
I need to know what size of drill bit to pick
Thanks👍👍👍
Do you guys know why my drill won't go as deep into the wall as the screw is. Like the hole is always to shallow and when I hammer it, it breaks.
The only reason I watched this was to find out what size drill bit to use with the anchor!
🤗 Thank you for creating a YouTube video on how to install a drywall anchor. I think your video is 🐯 GREAT! Also,  I think I will be successful with my efforts at installing my drywall anchors. 🤗 Once again, THANK YOU! 🤗  Paz et Amor, "PASTORJOEY4U!"
Wait! What did you use at the end?? I have been struggling trying to tighten with the drill but cannot fit underneath the bracket. Please help!
THANK YOU!
I did mine and thank you for this video. It may not be perfect but it will do fine. https://youtu.be/20I_YN084RE
Thank you! For years I’ve never been able to figure out why my curtain rods wouldn’t attached securely into the wall.
Thanks for the tips! I usually use Command Strips to hang my pictures. But a canvas fell in the bathroom for the 4th time today (over a period of years), so I am going to go the drywall anchor route now!
You don’t need an anchor if you drill into the stud correct?
Thank you so much for the video! Very helpful to me. I've never done that. It looked  scary to me  the idea of installing an anchor. I appreciate your video so much, now i feel confident about it. By the way, i am looking for something similar to the yellow wall organizer the you have in the room. do you know the name of it and where to find one? Thank you again
0:00 Buy it. Use it. Break it. Fix it. Trash it. Change it. Mail. Upgrade it.
1.1k dislikes... Like, I don't understand why??? This video explained exactly what I needed 100% 🤔🤔🤔
What if it’s not going in? I followed all of the instructions exactly
Niiice! Love this video. Such a helpful video!
This was exactly what I needed for my project to be sure I was doing it right. Thank you!
Thank you 💗 nice learning from a woman as well, thanks again.
Thanks I much appreciate the information. :)
How do you know which size of drill bit to use?
How do you know how big a hole to drill for the anchor,?
This was very helpful!
Well shoot i just tried drilling the plastic part in first.....bad idea
uh, you left out a VERY important question, that being what size drill bit do you use??? By comparison to the drywall anchor... That is what I really needed to know.
What size drill bit is that
Ur anchor is crooked use a level next time
Nice video! But do you stop turning the screw once you feel it tighten up? I have 2 sports ball holder brackets i put on my wall and i had to redo mine because when i kept turning the screw it would just keep turning even with the anchor in it. Im guessing your not supposed to turn it like you normally would with a stud in the wall?
Here after I got home from work and found my microwave on the kitchen floor😁.
What I hate about these drywall anchors is that instructions never tell you what size drill bit to use. They just expect you to eyeball it, which of course always leads to multiple attempts. Like, is the anchor about one size up from the screw it holds? Two? Three? What size is the screw even?
What if I don't have a drill???
I made it to three seconds.
Its so funny watching women work on stuff. You notice things they do alike. They're so cute
did not help, what  is  on the end of the drill? I need to know  this basic information to start. Is it a specific size I need to know about???? does  a bit or  tip match up with the screw?  does it match up with the dry wall anchor?  does the dry wall anchor need to match with the screw????????
Very nice and simple explanation!   Thank you for this!!
Hey , what's the size of the drill bit ? 2mm ?
Thanks for the info i first thought this was a cooking video.
Thanks
That helped a whole lot, thank you
Awesome thank you
Here in 2020 saying thank you! Single mom that tries to diy everything and I've been intimidated to do certain projects as other commenters have stated because I had no clue how to use the anchor screws. Tfs!
What size Drill Bit did you use?
Can I accomplish this without an electric drill?
Thank you so much
Thank you so much! Your video helped me tremendously.
I had no idea that it would be so simple!   I bought a cute. "girly" drill and bit set ("girly ", because it's pink and pretty😋)  and I was too damned scared to use it.  I just made my husband do the work.  This video makes me want to try it myself!😁 Maybe....lol
Thank you very much short & simple video
💖💖💖 Thanks so much!💖💖💖  This video was short, easy, and to the point. Dudes talk to much lol. There's another video on the exact same thing that's 16 mins cause the dude sits there and mansplains more than just showing how to do it.
I liked your video minus the fucking trump ad I couldnt skip
Thank you!!! You helped us, and our curtain rod is installed :)
This was such a great help, and I so appreciate you taking the time to make The video tutorial– thanks!
Wow she’s amazing 😂😂😂😭😭
How far into the wall are you supposed to drill for the anchor?
Four anchors later, four different sized drill bits, pliers to pull stuck anchor, small piece chipped drywall, drywall dust everywhere, and  hammer - the hook is finally in the wall!! Think I'll use heavy duty adhesive hook next time.
It's IMPOSSIBLE. The drywall anchor CRUSHES when you try and hammer it in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thanks you (:
Do not buy those plugs made in CHINA or its associates,  they use auto disintegrate plastic to make the plugs, when time come, the plugs disintegrate and the matter being supported collapse. This may be causing fatal accident !!!
Love the vid thanks
Thank you!!!!
Excellent
Best instructive video out there, thank you!
Very informative great video, i use to have to wait for my dad to do this stuff but i think i can do it myself now thank you and keep up the videos!
THANK YOU U  SAVE ME TIME 👍👍😁😁😁🤝🏼HELLO FROM LONG BEACH. CA
What size drill bit?!
Thanks for the video but small bit of advice: please don't pitch for "like/subscribe/support this video" in the starting of the video and waste time. Almost everyone knows how that works and it is usually best to ask for "likes" in the end so that people can do what they need to do. Moving on to next video without disliking.
Thank you so much!
Thank You.
Thank you for making this video! Really appreciate it.
Checking in from 2020. This is currently #1 video on youtube search for drywall / sheet rock installation/mounting
THANK YOU!!!! Ive been so intimidated by this, now I feel ready thanks to you!
Thank you for sharing. I was doing it wrong all along..lol
thank you! This was very helpful !
Oh ok..I thought so, but I was using the wrong screws, and as it being my first time.. I didn't know that some of them are bigger so the drill holes must be a little bit bigger..thanks vid put it in prepective
Great! But I don't have a drill bit🤔
Thx alot I have hung up anything in my room since I moved here I'm February because I couldn't figure out to drill it in correctly with out messing up my walls 🤦🏾‍♀️😂
I wish I watched this before I installed my curtains 😂
Cute
Thank you! Clear instructions, and demonstration of installing of a drywall anchor.
Hey thanks!
This was beyond helpful. I’m putting up curtains for the first time and the directions weren’t wall anchor beginner friendly lol thank you!
Video starts at 3:20 (unless you need to know how to drill a hole)
I put mine in but they all come out about 3 mm, but I can’t take them out further than that. Is that still safe?
Very informative and helpful-thanks so much! 🙋🏾‍♂️
Thank you! Very helpful.
Plastic Dry wall anchors are completely ass.
Oh my gosh THANK YOU! My husband and I were debating on how the anchor goes.  He was right... Ugh.   Lol ;)
Thank you !
Do you just guess at the size of the drill bit?
Hi I'm confused did u split the drywall anchors before you put them in the wall... I'm here in 2020!

thank you
Well thank you. I finally hung up my first shelf today and all though it took about 6 tries with figuring out the right size drill bit for the anchor i did it. I also didnt know it had to go all the in.
100 holes in the wall later I find this video🤦🏻‍♀️
Thanks for the tutorial!
Thank you for this video!! Also where did you get your curtains?? Haha
Thank you, it helped me! Independent women of the 21st century need these types of videos!
Firstly, this at least showed me how a drywall anchor is installed. Secondly, for your own sake you NEED to be making sure you are 90 degrees and straight to what you're drilling in or you WILL drill at an angle affecting the balance of what you're installing. You really should be using a level to take out the guess work and then the second screw would have been even. Thank you for the video :)
Thank you 🙏🏽 Thank you 🙏🏽
Great job.
awesome video.  I previously tried to use drywall anchors without making a pilot hole and the wire shelf ended up collapsing. Thank you!!!
I love that a women is showing it queen
Damn drywall anchor
Nope. Definitely still broke the wall anchor inside the wall 🙃

Thank you!!! Finally figure it out after 3 years!
What will I do if the hole that I made was a bit larger than the plastic anchor.?do I need to put in white cement inside? Thanks
All my plastic anchors broke trying to hammer it 😑
what size drill bit was used for the anchor? The instructions i have say to use a 1/8" drill bit but that is too small.
Thank you we were intimidated by hanging the shelves in our kitchen, home old and studs aren't correct. Is there one you recommend for heavy weights? I want to do solid wood shelves which are heavy and I want to display sundry items in mason jars again glass heavy jars. I want to be sure once I put them up they can hold the most weight as possible.
Do you need to know whats behind the drywall? Like wires or pipe?
Thank you for making this so simple and easy to understand!
Hell no
Thank you! I like your no-nonsense style & also allowing for the fact that we might not be super handy. So helpful.
Very helpful video and youtuber! 😍  What kind of drill is that?
I enjoyed it
Thank you
Thank you so much!! Now I feel confident to start that project that's been sitting around for months! <3
Just put my curtains up with the help of this video! Thank you!
I loved this video and she made it so much easier than many of rhe men that have videos - simple step by step instructions without a lot of talking about too many things at once. Cheers
I have never had to do my own maintenance before, so this was a literal godsend to my spoiled ass. Thank you!
Thank you SO MUCH for this!! I have been searching for videos on how to install drywall anchors, and I found a bunch of guys just talking about it without actually doing anything to *show* how it's done. Now I know what to do, and I can confidently move forward with my hanging projects. Again, thank you!   Have you ever changed a light fixture? I need help learning how to do that, too.
Very helpful! Thank you!
thanks
Watching this in 2020, very helpful Thanks!!
was wonder what that plastic thing was for thanks
Thank you for sharing! Even though I felt fairly comfortable about doing it on my own, your video helped me feel more way more confident!
Details please.  You do not mention the size of the drill bit to use.  Typical and frustrating—the one detail you want to know doesn’t get mentioned. Thank you.
You Should have mentioned what size drill bit to make the hole for what sized  anchor you were using since it’s usually the DETAILS people wonder about
Thank you, simple,  clear, through😊
Well done ASMR
It wasn’t straight after all that lol
Best video! It was the first video I opened and it was perfectly explained! Thank you! Do more
Thank you so much! I LOVE seeing women do all the things that men usually do. Thank you again. Girl power!
Stick to making sandwiches doll. The blind leading the blind....Normal gender roles have played an important role in society since the dawn of man. Only in recent times have people began to buck the system and question what has worked since day one. Get back in the kitchen sweetheart...lol.  kidding, not kidding....
Bought some new floating shelves and this helped out a lot! Thanks!!!
Nice....
I used a bit that was too big (wide) for the anchor, and so the anchors never attached solidly to the drywall.  What size drill bit should I use, in relation to the size of the anchor?  That is, should I measure the anchor near its middle to figure the width of the correct-sized bit, or should I measure the width of the anchor at its narrowest point; or at its widest point?  Is there some other system that will enable me to find the right sized bit for a given anchor?  Thank you.
How do I know which size drill bit to use?  Do I just estimate the size compared to the anchor?
Lots of people commenting that it's a girl doing a video and how awesome that is.  I really didn't think about that issue at all....I think that's a positive for me....(I already know women are awesome? and I already know they can do anything?)
Thank you!  :)
Thanks!!!
After boring 3 holes in my walls to hang a drapery rod, I gave up and found this video. Thank you!
The point about starting the hole before beginning with the drill bit was helpful to me. The measuring should have been obvious (I've got two holes to make on a horizontal line. The hammer. Obvious, unless you've never done it or seen it done. Perfect for a beginner. Thanks.
So the first one went well and the screw is tight but the others don’t tighten they just spin. What did I do wrong?
Thank you for this!!
Helped me mount a dyson to the wall. 👍🏼
Thank you for your clear instructions! First time installing drywall anchors and I feel confident now to do it!
Its a long time pending task in my house and this video helped me do it correctly fixing my curtain rod. Thank you 😊
i'm trying to put up floating shelves but i think im using the wrong bit. it's stopping dead not even an inch into the wall, which i was told is sheet rock. maybe my drill is too weak :/
So helpful , great video !
nothing about size of anchor and drill bit and screw?
What size drill did you use for the original hole??
use a level to make sure the bracket isnt at an angle
yikes
Instructions unclear anchor stuck behind wall.
What size drill bit
This was just what I needed to know, thanks!

Tysm I was able to hang my mirror in my room
Thank you for this video. I’m trying to hang up a ledge and I didn’t know why in the package they give me those drywall nails. Very informative and you go slow.
How do you know what size drill bit to use???
This was very informative, I realize now why the way I used to do it was so difficult. Thank you
Quick and informative!
she never says how big of a bit to use for the hole she drills before she puts the screw in, did i miss it?
Thank you so much for this very helpful video! 👍🤗
Thanks for this!
*Thanks!*
TY so much!!!
Very Helpful! Thanks so much.
Looks crooked.
watch it make it like it and support us 💀
Thank-You! I never understood what the plastic pieces were for. I also never realized I could use the drill to screw the screws in, Thanks!
Still having problems
Very clear instructions. Thank you
Thanks ✊🏿Woman Power😎!
Yes! I love women teaching me stuff!! A woman on YouTube is how I learned how to change a tire! This was helpful. Thanks! YouTube is great.
When you drilled into the wall, were you drilling with the screw at the tip of the drill? This point was not clarified. Also, what did you put into the wall before putting the screws in? Unclear video for a clueless person like me.
Thank you for this video!! I got a ruler personalized for my daughter.  And I've had it for 2 years and never put it up. Now I can. Yay thank you so much!!
thank you i will try this this week :)
Thank you. I was able to put up my new bathroom cabinet with the help of your video. #newhomeowner
Thank you for this video!! You saved us from destroying more walls 🙂. Thank you!
do i need to use a drill
Well, using a drywall anchor is probably a very elementary thing but no-one ever explains it and I have been completely intimidated from doing so many things because I didn't know how it was done, and am so grateful for your video explaining it in such basic and clear terms! I actually feel kind of relieved, I can definitely go places after this.
I don't have a drill 😭😭
For those who wonder what drill size you need for your screw size here it is: Screw #6-8 x 1" requires drill size 3/16" Screw #8-10 x 1-3/16" requires drill size 7/32" Screw #10-12 x 1-9/16" requires drill size 5/16"  *Screws are usually categorized by numbers or sizes as seen above and your drill size can be seen engraved on it, and of course the bigger the screw the heavier the load it will support.
Thanks for the tips
Hi thank you so much this video was a great help with hanging up a shower rod on drywall ...hugs
Use an awe instead of a screw and drill. This way you can control the hole size and use a level when making your holes
quick  dumb question  i  did  it step by step was able to get one  drywall anchor in the wall no problem  but when i  try to  continue  to  hammer another one in  it was like  it  tore  it  apart  i kept  tryn  needless to say  i went threw  six of em before  giving up  where did i go wrong? do  i need to get  different ones? was using  the ones   that came with  the curtain  i bought  at the dollar store
Very helpful thank u
For the first five seconds of this video I thought I was listening to the Busta Rhymes song touch it
Thank you for this video
Super clear and helpful!!!  Thank you :-)
Did u switch up your bits?
Thank you.. Very helpful
You got skills!!!!!!
What’s the fucking point if you HAVE A DRILL
What size drill bit?
She is using hair dryer as a drill machine 😂😂
Thanks for sharing. I’m now less intimidated after seeing you (a woman) do this.
Kewl

I love it! Thx so much! I love the details and the additional pictures! Keep it up.
Thank you so much for this video! Just put up some small shelves and didn’t know how to use drywall anchors until I searched this 💕
Thanks for the video's. I'm really learn a lot from its.
See my issue is with 75lb drywall anchors u either end up drillibg to big a hole or you strip the anchor because the whole is to tight
Thank you!
I have a really hard time getting the anchor inside the wall!! And it seems like it shouldn't be too hard looking at this video.   Any tips? I managed to get a third of it in the wall, but the rest just won't go in! I used a 3mm drill bit to drill the hole, and I am trying to push in an anchor that fits a 3mm screw. It just seems like the anchor is too big for it!
Do you have a suggestion when you overdrill (over size) a drywall hole for a small plastic anchor? I usually switch to a larger plastic sleeve, but I can't always do that because of larger screws don't look right on the fixture.
Very clear & simple - but hold the drill straighter!
Thank you!  You made it easy!
Thank you.
Best best best explanation . Simple and straight to the point, thanks.
Excellent tutorial. Thanks for the guidance! :)
Very informative. Thank you!
I think you're a pretty lady.
Thankyou!!
Awesome video
Laaaaame
in my dream .I ran out of gas.
Thanks for the video.
**OCD TRIGGER** *IT'S NOT STRAIGHT*
Most helpful simple instructional video on here thank you
Is it me ,or does that bracket look offset,should av used a spirit level first.this video wasn't that helpful to me.but anyway,at least she tried? Nice person though.
You could also get an extension for your drill so you don’t have to use a screwdriver
Why is she doing a man's job, and not cooking or raising babies?
Can I tell you how wonderful it was to look this up and find another woman giving a simple lovely confident explanation? THANK YOU!!! <3
I literally fucking turned this video off because of that chipper like it, make it blah blah blah, 3 seconds thumbs down
You didnt even use the plastic anchor. Weird
What size is the drill bit in relation to the anchor?
question, because the drywall is not that thick and the anchors will usually be longer then the thickness of the drywall. WHen you insert the plastic anchor, sometimes the screw pushes in the anchor too far in before screwing and I loose the anchor
Not much help to me. The video didn't explain how to determine what size drill bit is needed to properly secure the anchor.
im love it 💪
Your video was the first to show up in my search and helped a lot. Thank you!
Well bless you heart!   I am so glad I clicked on your "how to"  I did on someone else's a while ago & thought well I don't get it &  figured this won't happen today!   Thank You!!!!
Thank you 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
well done,maybe script what to say before doing future vids...other than that great job 👌
She sounds like Sandra Bullock
When demonstrating how to use tools, the person doing the demonstration should stop SHAKING the item they are talking about. They need to keep in mind that the viewer is trying to SEE what they are doing or holding. Shaking the object does not help.
Small world; I have those same Ikea curtains.
I can never get them to work correct. Either the hole is too big and the plastic anchor doesn't stay in, or the hole is small and I hammer the anchor in and half way it always bends and distorts
Thanks so much for this. Very helpful!
way to go in telling us what size drill bit to use
Thank you so much for this video! I'm trying to learn more about construction and as a woman I think it's very important to know. Thanks again and you go girl!☺️
loooool
How do you determine what bit size to use to drill the hole?
Thank you this helped alot
It's crooked. Should have had your husband help. (Just kidding lol)
Wir hätten heiraten sollen
Thank you. I couldn't have done this without your help. :)
Thank you so much, it was very informative.
Throw out those cheap drywall anchors included in product mounting kits. If you can't hit a stud, then you must use proper drywall anchors: hollow wall anchors, zip toggles, toggle bolts (butterfly anchors), etc. Even proper plastic drywall screw anchors work well if you don't exceed the weight limits (or use more anchors).
thank you very much
i dont have a drill can still hammer it in or no?
when I screwed the screw in, it pushed the anchor and it fell down behind the sheetrock
Just the tutorial I was looking for. Thank you!
I have these green drywall anchors that don't have a wider base. How do I prevent it from being pushed all the way back through the wall as I screw in my screw? This has happened to me in the past. I'm guessing I have to just not drill too large of a pilot hole and don't push too hard as I screw it?
Had never had to use these guys before. Thanks for the video. Helped me be sure of what I was doing.
What about leveling it out?
Thank you so much. It was very helpful and easy to understand.
Great Video!  I have always wanted to get better at doing that!
SO informative and easy to follow. Thanks so much beautiful lady!!!!
thank you!! very helpful
Please explain what size drill bit you use for anchor.  Also you don’t use a level to keep your bracket straight??  All done by “just looking?”  Very confusing...I’ll try another video..
I thought you did an awesome job with this.  TFS!
🙌🏾🙌🏾Thank you
what size drill bit are you using?
Soooooo helpful
Super helpful thanks! Good tip on the notch as well.
thank you!
Thank you dear! You are the one who helped me hang my curtains!
I have literally been struggling with this dang curtain rod for over 3 months. It was put up only because of this video! Thanks so much!!!
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much
Honestly I was so happy to see the number one video for how to use a drywall anchor was a woman so you go girl
I watched this vid without sound ,  it's to much talk and i like to get down to buisness right away, still really helpful though. thanks
this helped me so much and im so glad they made these things. but you are an annoying bitch. throughout the entire video i wanted to beat the shit out of you. listen up you little bitch, don't mess with me . DONT MESS WITH ME!
Hi, a couple of things, you should tell your audience that you have checked for studs and any other things behind where you want your fixings regardless of its location (good practice), also, after your your first screw you should have used a level to make sure a vertical alignment and finally, not all anchors should be hammered into the drywall.
Should the anchor already be split when you put it in the wall??
What number drill bit do I use?  The biggest one?
This was the only video I could find that actually helped. Thank you!
Useful video but you didn't mention anything about checking the level of the bracket (vertically) using a level.  The horizontal side of the bracket should be checked for its level too.
Thank you this was helpful.
Thanks so much!! Very helpful and easier then I thought.
Was going to help my mom put in rods, noticed she needed anchors and had no clue how to get them in the wall haha. Thank you ! This really helped 😁
Very helpful.  Thank-you!
No bad, but you need some professional tools.
not to difficult when we watch your demo - thanks
