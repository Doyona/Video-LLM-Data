Best video so far can you help Us on how and where to buy the ink refill please❤
Everything I needed to know in one shot thank you
The best explanation and examples for beginners of Copic markers I have watched on YT. Kudos and many thanks!! 🤗 I especially loved how you don’t sound like a game show host when talking to your audience. I can’t even tell you how many videos I have to pass up because the Youtuber sounds like a game show host. You were perfect in every way 😊
Thank you for this!
Very helpful to understand what the markers are capable of, and how to use them in a clear message. Thanks
That's really fantastic.  The end result looks very professional!!!  Great markers!
$2 each?! Girl where?
Thank you for sharing.  The information is helpful
Thank you soooo much for making this video!!! I've been strugling so hard with copics and now I have a good result 😊
My biggest problem is knowing where to put shading
Excellent!
Great vid, thanks for uploading!
Ive honested always loved copic markers the comors make art so beutiful and lively and 3d! But ive been to intemidated to try them and i sketch alot.   I feel alot better sbout trying them now after this, thank you!
I have Copic markers that have not been used very much if not at all for the last ten years. How can I rejuvenate these so I can start using them again. Thanks
Thank you for making this video. It helped
I just paid $53 for your book. I’m looking forward to it. It makes me feel good when I support caring and kind artists. Cheers from Tasmania, Australia 🇦🇺
You said the first number is the saturation of that color.  But another video said the second number denotes saturation.  Which is right?
Great introduction. Thank you 😊
Ik this is kinda old but I got a marker set that looks exactly like copic they have up to 3 numbers and comes with a colourless blender but they are called graphic markers i tried the techniques you showed and they worked so im a bit confused
Do you have online classes? You are the first colorist who explains and demonstrates these techniques in a manner that I “get”. Thank you.
This saved me so much stress. I've been looking for the right markers color the shade of cake and I can't seem to find the right ones.
THANK YOU!! I’m not an artist and struggle with beautiful comic coloring!
Thank u so much u helped me a LOT. I am starting  doodling so I needed copic markers. I I also needed knowledge about them before buying em. So thanks very much.
I like you.
Thank you soooooo much, that was such a good demonstration of how to use copic pens. Please put up more videos 👏

Love this video … she made it so simple to understand and follow for us beginners, thank you so much for sharing.
Finally  my parents accepted to get me copics
This was a fabulous help to me, as a beginner! I just had no idea how to start! I'm still afraid to try, but I'm going to! And I'm going to look for your book as well! Thanks so much!
Where have you ever seen a copic for $2.
I have a lot of Coptic markers I’m so afraid to use them That I might mess up my art project
I just bought an 80 pieces comic marker from amazon this really helped thank you!
This is honestly been the best and fastest teaching of Brush marker techniques and I THANK YOU FOR IT!!
After seeing this video, I just realized how coloring has its own techniques and how it effects the drawing you're coloring. I knew that but not to this extent. Btw, thnx for the tips!
Thanks for sharing, it helps a lot!
This helped me soooo much
Me having the square shaped comic markers watching this like: 👁👄👁💥 I’m screwed
So very nicely done, KaTe!
Thank you, this was very helpful! I think I'm finally mature enough to get copics :) I also never got them cos each one costed 7 DOLLARS and that is waaaaay to expensive for us. This Christmas I got literally a whole pack of around 50 (?) For 20 bucks. (I just saved myself around 300$ I'm so happy)
Thanks because now I know how to use them!!!!
This video is so helpful!

Thank you so so much. I bought a set of about a dozen various colours, but when I tried using them, I ended up with lots of splotchy/uneven surfaces and no blending really worked. With your explanations, I'm going to tackle the next drawing I make. Your way of showing and explaining things is both soothing and easy to understand.
Thank you so much
