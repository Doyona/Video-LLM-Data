It really is fascinating how the candy is made from the banana and i love the candy made from that banana its so good! i should make this for my ROTTEN grandkids like and ham
Oh, so these candies are actually the scam - no taste except for the sugar one, plus artificial ones? What a waste of hopes and saliva 😔
Hello from the future. No, we still have bananas.
Sometimes I like to come back to this video to remind myself why I want to get into candy/food making. Bringing joy to people, having fun doing it, (and you get to try a sweet treat every now and then).
Honestly I've always eaten bananas from the flower side (? Idk, the brown part not stem) solely bc I'm not strong enough/ idk how to open it from the stem part (honestly how do you do that??) Anyways, it doesn't matter that much to me anyways bc I don't particularly like bananas, but cool fact!
Banana and Lemon.  2 flavors I cannot get enough of.  The Grape Drops are a backup to the others, Super Yummy!.  Hope all is well Greg.   The folks at Hercules Candies sends their love.  Thanks for the fast orders, to "fix" my tooth.    I knew there was reason why we needed New Guinea.  Birthplace of Bananas!
The days before the batch roller!  This was the first video of yours I watched, probably 4-5 years ago. I've watched them all since and ordered plenty of your candy!  I'd order more but oof, shipping to the UK isn't easy these days.
I’ve had this flavor candy from you guys. I kind of wanted it to be the artificial flavor lol.   Just curious, the natural flavor that you guys use, is that based on the gros michel or the cavendish?
Another great banana story, one of the best episodes of the old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons was called "Banana Formula." In this episode, it was revealed that Bullwinkle could remember everything he ever ate. The main plot was Boris and Natasha stole a formula for a silent explosive, and they wrote it on a banana to hide it from Rocky and Bullwinkle, but Bullwinkle accidentally ate it. And believe me, the storyline is as crazy as it sounds.
Apparently this a complete misconception. They just use one of the banana flavor chemicals, not all of them.
Omg just got my banana candy in the mail it’s the BEST flavor EVER!!!!! In it way it is reminiscent of cotton candy flavor🤔 but definitely 100% banana. Perfect for a banana lover like myself
The banana is pronounced "row michelle".  It's French.  Gross Michael is funny as hell though
Not too worried about bananas dying off.  There's a doomsday seed vault in Norway, and I'm sure they have banana seeds
I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this! I'm not a huge fan of the normal artificial banana flavor but this flavor started from that and developed into a really sweet savory light banana-y flavor! Good job on this one
what does the candy taste like when it's still soft and goo like
I got the variety pack and the banana was the sleeper hit. Now I need a whole pack.
So...why do they still culture only one type of banana? It seems like they didn't learn from the mistakes made the first time.
5:31 "great a-peel" huh 😂😂😂
Bananas are legitimately one of my least favorite foods full stop, but this video almost makes me feel like I need to learn to like them, because they might be gone some day
Cool
Haha, i love these videos and it’s great to hear your stories along side them. I do have a bit of a nitpick for you however. The “Gros Micheal” is actually a French name and therefore would be pronounced more like “Grow Michelle”. Sorry, my French brain just needed to get that out. 😋💛
Why didn't you use your lovely machine to make the rods? Also, how do you know how thick each layer of candy needs to be?? 🤔 Your videos have opened up a whole new universe to me!
It's Gros Michel,  not Gross Michael,  and artificial banana flavor wins in my book any day over Cavendish mush taste
These and the watermelon are addictive.
Welp I better start saving up now so when I go to this place later in life I can buy as much as I possibly can, I dont care if it’s a lot of candy I’m eating it
❤️
I’ve tried at least a dozen of your flavors, and this is by far my favorite.  The flavor reminds me of candy necklaces from when I was a kid.  I wonder if they used the same flavoring.
I'm glad you touched on the dangers of monocultures but the part about how banana flavored candy is based on the gros michel is just a myth.  Weird Explorer has a good video on the different types of bananas.
Can't believe this channel is so popular. I not only live in Tally, but I've been to Lofty several times. So wild, but you guys deserve the attention.
I'm going to walk the dog, make dinner, pack the bong, and queue up a Lofty Pursuits playlist.
this is the best way to make candy , confirmed , sure there is no mass producing but it's easier to run
The Gross Michael.
I literally just wanna make candy for a living now
Road trip!
That artificial banana flavour is one of my favorite flavors
I'd heard the story about the problems of banana monoculture both past and present, but this is the first video I ever heard that actually talked about the modern banana in a more positive way.
The modern world is an interesting place.  Bananas became seedless because a polyploid emerged that had an odd number of chromosomes.  Due to this misnumbering, it wasn't sexually viable so it produced no seeds.  So the only way to reproduce it was to clone it.  And that gave us the seedless bananas we know and love.  But in the here and now, if something were to happen to our seedless culivars, we could go back to the seeded bananas and artificially induce it to become polyploid... et voila, a new cultivar of seedless banana.  But, this new seedless would obviously be replacing the Cavendish just like the Cavendish replaced its predecessor.  So the flavor of bananas would change again, and then - your candy version of Cavendish banana would become a flavor of the past just like its predecessor banana flavoring.  That's just fascinating to think about.  Flavors lost to time... preserved in candy.
Yo your banana candy is amazing
I had some of these. FAN-TASTIC. Y'all haven't lived till you've had these.
how is the actual molten candy at the beginning made??
This episode is definitely my go-to to introduce people to this channel, that way I can hopefully one day take a road trip with some people
Ordered some of this candy a few weeks ago. Can't wait to get it. Shipping times are long though so hopefully by Christmas 🤣🍌
The way he keeps seamlessly switching from instructions on making his candy back to banana facts is too much for my brain to keep up with I love it
The way he keeps seamlessly switching from instructions on making his candy back to banana facts is too much for my brain to keep up with I love it
Im rewatching these(and crying) but  Imagen  One day  Your kid  Your grandkids  Are gonna come up to you and ask what a banana is
How does he cut then so fast
Last time I checked monkeys just eat the banana whole
It’s like they say, never trust a skinny chef.
You are a professional!
HOW DID HE DO THAT!!!! Amazing!!
Why does everyone ask about artificial banana specifically? No artificial flavor tastes like what it's supposed to
Dude, I love your videos.  I get to learn stuff and watch someone who is a master at their craft!  Bravo sir
What you're doing wrong is not peeling the banana from the wrong end. It's peeling the banana, period. Just eat the whole thing. Most of the nutrition's in the peel, anyways.
But I like the artificial flavor! I can't tell you how many times I crave a banana milkshake with those artificial flavors. Don't get me wrong, a fresh banana blended into a vanilla milkshake is great, but I absolutely love milkshakes made with banana-flavored ice cream that uses that artificial banana flavorings. Impossible to find those ice creams in stores though...
I have never been a huge candy person, but this is amazing work. You are an artist! Next time I'm in Fl Ill stop by and try some of these beauties! For now Ill subscribe.
I think my favorite part of watching your videos is when you take the candy rides and break them into the little pieces.
They'll need to develop another commercial variety. I've been reading about it recently.
Whynot make the all in the video because how mach the contiti of material.shogr water making sistim
What is the recipe ?
Who's singing and playing in the background?
Some pretty cleaver uses of geometry
It's pronounced grow mishel
Nooo. Not the banana split. My favorite dessert
5:32 I see what you did there!!! Puns are punderful!
This video made me want to try your candy, a Gross Michael, and learn how Gross stopped meaning large and started to mean disgusting.
I don't like bananas. I've never tried a gros michael though
I dont like banana split.....i simply dislike the taste of raw banana....idk why.....but if the same banana is used to make fries, cake or anything, i love them so much.....i find it kinda weird about it...i'm pretty sure i dislike the raw banana not because of the taste since the cooked banana still taste like banana....not sure why...maybe the texture
9:30 lol he is like Im so sick of people holding their hands out forever, I am going to get to you and drop it on the counter and act like I didn't know hahaha.
Me from Tallahassee entertained by the people who stumbled across the channel
Wow i loove Bananas so much, thx guys :D
Ohh that's so interesting 🙂 but is that type of candy still around and what store do y'all ship them at? Like any store or
I like bananas, but I don't like banana-flavored foods, such as candy or ice cream. I do like banana cream pie and banana bread, provided they don't have flavoring added. I would like to try your banana candy, though. Do you sell sampler packs of some of your candies?
I love watching your videos!
Bro really blessing us with banana knowledge
What’s the PD for poopy disputes? lol
Do you want a banana? Peel it down and go "mmmmm mmmm mmm
Gros Michel is French it's pronounced "Grow Michelle"
Banyanyas :3
If you look at yourself in the mirror than look at a banana you may see the resemblance.  🍌
Bananas have seeds..
Wild bananas looks suspiciously like inga pods. 🤔
I like how these videos aren’t just about the candy, they’re always filled with fun and new information related to the candy being made! I keep learning new things all the time thanks to these videos!
Lol i packfruit part time, honestly cant stand the smell of bananas anymore 🤣😂😅
Makes sense... I still don’t like banana flavored things. Maybe I’ll have to try your banana flavor.
Rhe banana candy is the best ive had by far! Love it will be ordering more as soon as these are gone had to had them taken away wouldnof ate entire bag n 1 sitting lol
why do i want to order this candy so bad omg
i wonder what he means by the banana having complexities and overtones. he doesnt explain....
Lofty pursuits is now one of my favorite channels. It pleases my inner child with all the candy, and pleases my outer adult self with peaceful music, awesome narration and knowledge i never knew i needed
This video sure did make me crave a nice banana.
BANANNA
9:32 the candy didn’t get into the child’s hand, lol
In Britain the sweets taste like banana
Fun fact bananas are the first fruit meme
Most fruit flavours don’t taste like the real thing like strawberry cherry grape etc
i hate bananas
A man talks about banana history whilst making banana candy
You don't just get to see how candy is made, but you also have a lesson
We have collected lots of seedless banana seeds. There is a rare chance that seedless strains will grow a seed or two and they are filtered out when making processed banana products and the seeds are sold to growers.
I really like your history explorations in this video... But I am fairly disappointed that you did not talk about one of the most important things when it comes to bananas in our society. I'm obviously talking about the banana republics and how dangerous, for example, the Chiquita company really is.
take a shot every time he says banana
when i see this im like. "why the heck are they using an anvil to cut candy on. why not just the edge of a counter
The artificial banana flavoring is the best
💜
I like the voiceovers delivery. =)
I wish I was the number 1 banana worldwide
Keven from the office
Banana
just him cutting the candy 8:20
I like the video, just hate the way you pronounce gros michel xD
Glad to see the bananas still exist
thankyou for the banana lecture. Very epic
1:58 W H A T
Why can't they get the earthy flavor of banana right? Everything I've ever tried tastes like green apple without citric acid.
I live in Germany and this video convinced me to go all the way across the Atlantic to get some candy from this shop
Some day I want to be able to have my own candy cooling table...
Just got some of these today in the mail! Delicious and also the artwork looks even better in person :) Hope I can stop by the physical shop some day.
2020?
I'm honestly so happy I watched this video 'cause now I want to meet these people and try their candies.
My variety pack just came in today and I love this banana candy!
As someone who has gros michel tree they taste better then our current bananas
9:31 Fail.
I know this video is 2-3 years old, but I'm wondering if that "banana sickness" is still around. I worked in a grocery store as an essential worker for a couple months during the beginning of COVID 19 and most of the banana batches we got in from produce looked pretty bad.  Granted they were speckled brown or pretty ripe, but our customers and most grocery shoppers expect perfect yellow bananas so it was just weird to see batch after batch not meet that standard. Maybe it was part of that "sickness"?
I have gucci banana
I like bananas because they have no bones
Chiquita CO is responsible for one of the biggest massacres in my home country Colombia. They killed (and pretty much errased from history) a whole town of 3kplus people... look it up: masacre de las bananeras
fuck im supposed to be sleeping right now
You'd think that, hmm, maybe we should stop with the f**king monocultures
I put bananas on top of my rice and beans. It tastes good. Odd, but good
I already liked bananas before, and you went ahead and made this video which just kept getting more interesting each second, I didn't know you could talk about bananas for 10 minutes and make me interested and attached to the story! Congratulations, your place has made it into my bucket list. I have to eat breakfast there!
2 years later and this is what I’m recommend (honestly not disappointed)
subscribed
i had no idea you guys existed, but now i want nothing more than to eat candy
that man is chopping those candies like its second nature
*drops candy* *cuts to outro immediately*
Couldn't help but chuckle a bit at that line about looking back on history then immediately following up with a book by Chiquita and fond memories of it. Chiquita was formed from the United Fruit Company which dated back to 1899, and oh lordy, those guys were like the real life equivalent of Weyland Yutani or Umbrella Corp back in the 1900s, just absolute pure evil, I'm talking massacring striking plantation workers with machineguns kinda evil, and even up to recent times have been involved in some seriously shady stuff.
Banana doesn’t feel like a word to me anymore
I got to order more of this candy. It was great. Love yalls videos and yall do great work.
this guy is dope
If bananas are gone then the future is not worth living
Wow, this guy is really intelligent. He loves what he does.
5:35 I see what you did there…
This man narrating truly loves his work - I think that is so cool . I never realized bananas had such a complicated history but I gotta say- it's very interesting . Thank You YT algorithm
2:00 now this i can relate to
idk why i watched this all the way through but my take away was i have been peeling bananas wrong all my life and that even a monkey knows better
*watching this with the banana candy in my mouth bc the taste is immaculate 👁👄👁*
Totally pro narrator in this one. Hat off to you mr.
how many times did he banana
Next we will have brown or green bananas
Woah he can cut fast
I used to make tableside bananas Foster at a Swiss restaurant in Park City.
That looks like a non-Newtonian fluid when you are pulling it off the table.
Why is it that all the best stuff manufactured in the U.S. was made prior to WWII or even earlier?
Wonder how many times he said banana in this video 🤔
Subscribed
Do you deliver to ontario ?
This is one of the best videos I’ve seen all year , so wholesome and I love bananas 😍
It's incredible how much you can learn about bananas in 10 minutes
dont really care, im just quarantined
WOAH GUSTEAU!
When he said lEtS taLk aBoUt ThE HiStOrY oF bAnaNaS.   I felt that.
Like the Gros Michael, Cavendish will continue to exist even if the fungus does its worst. It just won't be commercially viable as a mass produced product. People already have developed viable alternatives to Cavendish, so the coming bananapocalypse will be much like the one that came before where bananas suddenly become rare and expensive for a few years, then are replaced by something that is yellow and curved like a banana but looks slightly different and tastes significantly different.   It's likely that the reintroduction will be a little smarter as well, with something akin to "heirloom tomatoes" as companies take advantage of the temporary rarity to establish a higher price point and market bananas as premium products with a number of patented varieties. We will inevitably see a mass farmed banana emerge that will be somewhat less expensive, albeit more expensive than Cavendish today, that will fill the same role as hothouse tomatoes for the "I just want a banana" majority of consumers, but I suspect it will be branded cultivation due to the money different groups have put into designing them.   ("Heirloom tomatoes" are just tomatoes that haven't been selectively bred to be vividly red...which happened to be the same gene that reduced the flavor. They have to have a fancy sounding name or consumers just see them as ugly tomatoes without tasting them.)

~I like bananas because they have no bones~
This was wholesome
Why did I even watch this video...      I hate bannanas..
For some reason I was distracted by the guy watching you in the background
Every once in a while I watch this video
this video is so well made. all the info on bananas! I hope everyone is ok
Pls come to Midvale utah
Just tried this candy! It is Awesome! Really nice natural flavor, not artificial at all! Love it!
i bought it
You sir are a charismatic personality
Am I the only one who can fall asleep to this mans voice
oh this is so nice
I found this channel on a whim and now i love it for some reason.
Okay but nobody is gonna talk about the banana with massive seeds?
yeah i major in banana history
Great voiceover. Really loved all the information provided.
Corona virus brought me here and I was not let down. I just learned that not only is the world ending, but we are also losing bananas. Great.
Bananatacular!
I was today years old when I learned that bananas had seeds
The name game - ahs “LANA LANA BANANA
what kind of genius are you ? :D great video !
me: what do watch today  youtube: ya like *B A N A N A L E S S O N S*
this video made me eat more bananas and just appreciate them more
This was the most calm video I could find
i want to try a older banana flavor because i love banana candy
This is bananas!
OK I'm totally gonna spend 6$ on a bag of candy now uwu
I worship the nana
Bananas dude
I’ve never been so enticed and fascinated by bananas.! 🍌
what is the song at the beginning?
I like to eat bananas because they dont have no bones
Ware is this place
Me: *picturing the banana taped on a wall*
I could do without the Bob Dylan cover in the background. Lol
That candy cutting asmr tho
am i the only one who loves the flavour of artificial banana??
i went to lofty pursuits for the first time and i had fun watching them make candies! I would love to go back with my family and get some icecream too
i promise myself that one thay i will try these. watching this video make my mouth become water
i can listen to banananananana facts all day
At 5:58 it looks like a corn dog!
I know it's just chemistry and a master of his craft at work, but damn if it doesn't look like magic how he pulls and molds that candy into different shapes, sizes and colors.
I have no idea what he’s talking about. If there’s any artificial candy flavour that tastes like the real thing it’s banana. Cherry, watermelon, grape, apple are wayyyyyy more unlike their parent flavour.
i bet this guy really liked the duct tape banana. super interesting vid btw!
this is how many times he said banana    👇
Bananas are herbs ?!
"gross micheal" sounds a lot less appetizing than "grow me shell"
chances are you didnt search the video
Iso game - do a shot every time he says banana
I don't even like candy or sweet stuff, bananas are alright though, but this video was fascinating.
Wow I really liked this I wasn't sure I would when I clicked it but it was nice to see how hard candy is made and get a little knowledge on bananas
All I care about is the banana facts
ummmmmm. cavendish........ gros michel Love these vids BTW
All this banana talk   Uni corn droppings   Phallic shapes Is this video about candy or something entirely ???
My arms are sore.
i aint using no damn knife to open a banana
I now know how to peel a banana the right way.
That dropping of the candy off the boys hand, deliberate? Funny way to end the video!
First mousetraps, then shrimp aquariums, and now banana candy. Oh YouTube, you know EXACTLY what I need at 4AM.
It’s 2 am and I’m watching a guy make candy I really don’t understand where my life is going
banana banana banana banana banana banana banana banana banana....
lllllllBREAKINGlllllllNEWSlllllll   Bananas have become a new underground currency and their value has multiplied by over 9000 !!!
old vid, but you look like a old school candy maker. also. 0_0
2 years later, covid-19 is here. We still have bananas
The is also a superstition among sailors about it being bad luck to have bananas on board a ship. This is probably due to bananas giving of ethylene gas as they ripen, at worst in an non-ventilated hold of a ship it can build up and explode if ignited. It can also cause eye, nose, throat irritation & skin rashes.
Am I the only one who thinks he says "fountain" strange?  ....."fout'n"......

Hey what's you guys' business address? I may be in Tallahassee whenever this whole virus thing blows over.
This video has definitely has me subscribed and I want to visit as well!!! Love the info given in the vid.
I like bananas because they have no bones
Covid19: humans are dying  Youtube2020: hey, bananas might die too
this is peaceful in its own way
I see a lot of comments from 1 year ago... I guess this is the second wave of this being Suggest to everyone
It’s a real life weenie hut jr
I gave a friend a banana once.  He thanked me a _whole bunch._  😉
DAMN BRO HES A LEVEL 99 BLACKSMITH 8:19
Yes thank you~! I've been telling people bananas are closer to a flower than a fruit! Most people think I'm retarded.
He is the Bob Ross of candies
I never thought I'd be thoroughly entertained by a confectioner talking about banana history.
I need to go to Tallahassee now.
People made fun of how I open bananas but now they know they're actually just stupid
Chiquita banana was originally a company that abused work rights and had control over an ENTIRE COUNTRY
Okay youtube Quarantine banana candy.
Truly enjoyed this video!
Ok YouTube, I'll watch this.
Take a shot every time he says banana
Wait... is April gonna be the month that.. BANANAS GO EXTINCT?!?!
bananas are still here yesssss
If I somehow end up down in your area for whatever reason I will try this candy!
now that i think about it a lot of fruit flavored candy doesn't taste like the actual fruit like watermelon strawberry raspberry and a bunch of others
2:50 when the gyms closed and your triceps are getting flabby
whys this in my recomended. a gudt from above? absolute gem
this candy is the most accurate to a real banana, its very good and worth every dollar, just be patient while waiting for it to deliver im sure there busy
Don't worry, GMOs will save the banana....also chocolate btw (cocoa bean has the same same fate). Will probably also bring back the Gros Michel.
These candies look great, too bad hard candy is disgusting.
I thought for sure Coffee or cacoa would've been more popular crops than bananas.
Tbh it's the best to see people that love doing their job doing their job
take a sip everytime he says banana
Day 20 of quarantine: mmmmm qandi
9:30 poor kid dropped his candy
This video exceeded my expectations 11/10
BANANAS ARE GOING EXTINCT?!?!?!?! *rushes to buy seeds, a greenhouse and heater*
big mouth bitch
I love banana culture
This gave me a new appreciation for bananas.
1:20 thanks lotus boob; ruined everything that looks even remotely similar.
and then i am over here allergic to bananas :(
I came here out of curiosity and i left happy
9:30 That kid: "All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces......"
i dont even like hard candy, but when i vacation in america, i have to visit your place, i bet all your food tastes great
Another round of Youtube suggesting this? Not complaining in the least, but just not too much similar to what I watch normally (Again, not complaining. I like diversity in my daily watching... Especially in this quarantine time)
the fact that this is handcrafted but with an image of a banana in every candy piece is really a show of human enginuity.
i still dont get how it has that perfectly defined banana inside of it, like you put that big blob of darker candy in it with a kind of banana shape, but it doesnt seem as defined and with the exterior lines mildly darker as well as the line that crosses the banana in half, how does that apear
8:28 fast workers on the plant
I wish you guys were hiring. Moving to Tallahassee soon.
I knew about the pealing bananas thing.
9:31 poor kid, his candy fell from his hands
I can somehow smell this video
no idea why i got recommended this video but i subbed, and its actually really interesting
Oooo, I actually knew about peeling bananas that way but had forgotten about it... I didn't know it kept the fibres on the peel though! I just thought it was easier to peel; you can just pinch it at the flower end and the skin will split.
You sir, are the single greatest youtuber. You made me love what you do and I learned heaps. Good job YT algorithm
One word for this video... Bannana
1:51 me in the back if i worked there
Good video. You should take time to fix your microphone's background noise though. For somebody who is into quality videos, it's kind of annoying.
Fine greg ill go to your store
Youtube recomendations 2020 anybody!?
All these years I've thought Florida was a crazy place for all of the wrong reasons!
This was fascinating! Great narration!
This man sounds like he has a story for everything, and it's great
Why am I here
Looks like some dank dab
When all this mess is over, ill go there, promise.
This video made me buy candy... I got sucked into buying some. Can't wait to try it!
Can I get a banana count
I miss tallahassee 😭😭😭
that was pretty calming and neat, thank you.
9:30
9:30 Why he let cuz candy drop like that...
Lol the kid that dropped his candy on the counter
2am and I'm really invested in this man's candy and banana knowledge
the yoshikage kira of bananas
I love this style of candy!
Cute and amazing :)
I didn't think they Square tube stock and modern nuts in the 1800's
Cool banana facts !
I clicked on the link to their website, and the first thing I see is Corona Candy.
Ok YouTube I will watch a video that was made 3 years ago at midnight
No hating, but he completely forgot about the sugar cane crops.
i click cause a week ago watch the same candy type but on japanese store didnt usa has the same kinds of stores
I've learned more things about bananas in this video than my 4 years in University.
the way he cuts the candy at the end is so mesmerizing
I have never heard of this business in my life until just now but I hope you and your business are very successful. I love your passion and I am determined to visit this place before I die.
Candy 🤤
I didn't know I wanted this Youtube, but I submit
This is my childhood dream. Every day on my way home from school I'd stand mesmerised staring into my local sweet shop window at the workers pulling sugar over those hooks. It's always been a dream of mine to be able to do that myself.
...applaud???
I've never learned so much about bananas
I call the "flower end" the "bananus."
damn, got caught in the youtube again....  though this video is the most interresting random video i've seen in years ^_^   really fascinating and educational.
Umm I have no child hood I think I've never had a banana split
i wonder what hes singing
I’m oddly compelled to go to Tallahassee just for some banana candy. You know, after Coronavirus. And I don’t even like bananas.
Sam O'Nella's video on banana republics lowkey ruined Chiquita banana for me.
more likely than the banana going extinct is variation... there are a lot of horticulturists that are working on new banana strains using everything from gene splicing to quasi-primitivism.  I'm excited for the day when we can go to the grocery store and have a choice between five or ten or more different bananas, like we do now for apples.
I still dont understand what makes people think that peeling from the stem is right. It just doesnt seem natural
Came for the candy making, stayed for the banana history lesson.
Same with grape flavoring, doesn't taste like grape... but it sure taste like purple.
high af learning about bananas... awesome
I can't explain why, but this is one of the most delightful and wholesome things I've seen in a long time. Bravo!
I want to come
Very cool and informative video.
I only came here to see if whether or not you have your banana history one point or not. True facts coming from this man, he knows his naners!
Well, the Banana Video strikes again. Also TL:DL of the banana flavoring thing is Same fruit Different breed.
I'm from fl I need to stop buy cause that looks yummy
6:01 did he just cut it with the handle?
This vid was bananaz
Bought some candy from the online store, great way to pull people into the store! Can't wait '😁
i didnt search this and neither did you
an anvil in a lollie store
This guy is bananian fanatic and his religion is banana(in minion's voice)
Is nobody going to mention how the maker of this candy was breathing on it the entire time? ....
Bananas are one of my favorite fruits!  🍌 thanks for the video!
I LIKE BANANAS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO BONES
If I ever get the chance to come to the US I'm coming here to try everything
This is the 3rd time being recommended this video after watching it the past 2 times over the course of probably a year.     It is a good video though, c'mon.
be honest. you didnt search for this did you
I dont know why this is in my recommendation but Im not complaining
8:42 you can see the people at the counter staring at the candy. I’d be staring too. Such methodical cutting.
No man should love bananas as much as this man this man is the only Exception
“The yellow wrap is what gives our banana candy it’s great a-PEEL.”
...
Glass candy! Y'know? Those videos there they take glass out of a big oven and they keep twirling it around? Its like that but candy! I wanna play with it!
The Top Banana, you might say.
Bro, this guy is so wholesome, i love it already lol
i have no clue why this is in my recommended but its great
Bananas aren't dying. They're just all at risk of dying very quickly because they're clones. But, then again, once a parasite mutates, could it price itself out of a market? eyyyyyy
Peter Griffin
Man good thing I've been peeling bananas from the brown tipped end
who is watching this in quarantine?
Bananas.
day 5 of quarantine: *BANANA CANDY*
I like bananas, because they have no bones!
5:50 looks like he's rolling a big joint
9:31 was perfectly cut, Watch the boy on the left lmao
psychotic observation with bananas
Dont know why I was recommended this but I’m all for it
i lovethisguy
Satisfying and educational
Man, this place seems rad! I wanna visit this place now haha! Really interesting vid
I´m in love with the story telling and voice, makes me feel like I am at a nice uncles house that always has fun facts and candy..
YouTube: Hey want to watch a guy banana candy Me: um i don't kno- YouTube: Its playing :) (I didn't know i needed this)
Banana candy tastes like bananas. Don't be so pretentious.
Are these maggots inside the banana candy?
i've never heard anyone speak so fondly about bananas before.
This voiceover takes me right back to tour busses in New York City and Washington DC! Just with better sound quality :)
9:32
9:30, that kid held out his hand so long just to drop it when he finally got one...
Too bad you didn't dip into the dark stain of US foreign policy: banana republics
Google listening to me again... I bought 2 bunches of bananas and they could hear me eating one though the MIC!  But ill have to try the other way of peeling the banana like you said next time for sure.
why would you use a plastic spoon on something thats boiling hot...? you're getting plastic in all of the candy and its terrible for you lol
9:31 the candy falls from the kids arms
Let's get a big F in the chat for my boy at 9:31
"Your peeling the banana from the wrong end *Uses Knife*"
This guy is awesome I don’t even know him. you my internet friend have gained a subscriber
Rollin Banana backwoods
The story of why banana flavored candy doesn't taste like the bananas we eat today is purely anecdotal.  Anyone who's ever had a Gros Michel banana knows this. Banana is simply a difficult flavor to accurately replicate artificially. The same is true with artificial grape flavorings. Candy makers like to tell this story to try and explain away the question, but the truth is that banana flavor is hard to recreate.
man we really needa take care of the bananas of the world or we're toast...
Just bought some banana candy and cherry candy :)
what's up with the banana doom crap? there are many surviving kinds of bananas. why do you people always do this?
8:54 Dayum he fast..
I've been telling people for years that you're supposed to peel a banana from the bottom and they all just look at me like I'm nuts
If they could reference you in a fallout game.
Cool video Mr man. Wholesome.
5:34 great a - peel
Made 10,000 pieces. Handed out one tiny one lol.
the bananas we all eat these days are bred and cultivated, they will never go extinct dont worry partna
Thought the thumbnail was a maggot but the candy did look good
Your arms must be jacked doin that candy pulling everyday
I like the banana flavor found in candies. If that resembles the bananas my grandparents would have had, I want that banana.
This was actually very interesting and he has actual knowledge on it
the strands are fibres and they are good for our diet. recommended not to eat a banana that way.
The adult all like "wait what i get candy too?"
Very cool video 🍌🤏
i learned more about bananas today than in my whole lifetime
Why did I see this video say banana and then begin laughing like a maniac?
3 years later and i still hate bananas
This was very relaxing
I wanna taste that candy rolling hook
Banana's are half of my identity.
looks like an ad in rick and morty
9:31 poor kiddo
R u greg?
I bet that hook ain’t sanitized.. but IM FROM AND LIVE IN TALLAHASSEE FLORIDA
we adopted our cat from Talahassee Florida about 11 years ago.
Id dab this
I don't think they 'bred the seeds out,' as all they had to do was wait for a mutation to happen. In the case of bananas this is known as a Triploid, in other words 3 sets of chromosomes due to a fault during Meiotic division. As Triploids are sterile, the seeds don't form properly. This off course is why they need to cultivate offshoots.   Unfortunately, water melons are annuals, so there is no way to breed from the seedless triploid version!
Ughhhh i wish you guys were in the Panhandle!
It’s been a while
"it would be a much sadder place without banana splits" i never had a banana split.
this video is just a man making banana candy and talking about bananas i like this video this is going in my yes playlist
*I'm allergic to bananas*
8:00's where i realized what inspired goregrind. He'd probably be really good at blast beats
Peter Griffin?
Tbh when I’m bored I go to ur store and steal candy
You're a very interesting guy.
Excellent video! Thank you so much for sharing this.
monoculture banana good news everybody. if the current blite does become a bigger than normal problem we have other types and cross breeds. yes that's right banana companies do have diverse growths and can and do cross cut / splice into the current crops to strengthen them.   More importantly if we get stuck with a regrow situation there will only be a few years of drout before the new plants get spliced with mature cuttings. (one of the big problems with cultivating them is how long it takes the plant to fruit for the first time) splicing cuts that down alot.   in fact you may have already eaten the new strain and not even notest it. They tried hard to keep the taste and such the same.
the kid at the very end wanted one so bad you made him wait then dropped it on the counter crushing his banana dreams
A man with true passion for his work is very refreshing.
I was listening to a lot of bob dylan lately and this popped up in my recommended and I really didn't understand why.   blowin' in the wind is playing in the background. youtube is kinda creepy
Whys it lookin like a maggot
One of my favorite things about the south
Are you able to take a bite of the gooey candy while its still soft or would it be too hot?
The word banana makes me laugh now
5:31 I see what you did there

Me: This doesn't look too hard   Me at 8:09: This man is a GOD
Love your commentary instead of quietness of some other videos of this! It feels so legit and family-like! Love you already!
Jesus I didn't expect him to cut the candy so friggin fast
This title makes no sense
I wish someone loved me as much as this guy loves bananas..
why he talkin like the banana is the last hope for humanity
Right, I now have about 999,000 facts about Bananas. Thanks youtube!
great video, who is that bob dylan cover by?
Bro i was legit thinking about this video but forgot the channel name and i get this in my reccomended
the threads of the banana are the healthiest part btw dont remove it all just most
When he showed the banana in the candy, "Are you kidding me?!" were the first words to mind.
I absolutely love the artificial banana flavor. Especially since I'm allergic to bananas
I'd really love it if he would make an 8 hour video of a bunch of candy making videos put together to help me sleep at night. Watching this is soo relaxing
Don’t worry. We will still have bananas even if the Cavendish falls by the wayside, just like we still have bananas after the failure of the Gros Michel monoculture. After all, there are plenty of other types of banana and most bananas are eaten close to where they are grown (and are more likely to be strains other than the export oriented Cavendish), so it probably won’t entail food shortages either.
I tought that was a piece of bologna inside a cucumber
Well its history class and i like it
This guy is bananas 🍌
One of my first memories when I lived in Ecuador some 40 years ago - a bunch of 8 bananas cost a penny.  And I ate bananas in so many different ways - fried, boiled, cooked with meat, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Love this video I still re-watch it over and over and I dont get bored of it. It reminds me when my dad used to take me to his jelly factory, its not the same but it still nostalgic. never delete this video thank you.
Candy is my favorite reason to live
everyone’s journey starts here
eating a bag of these rn while watching this :3
Ive been watching this video alot and never ever got tired of this Thank you can I order this on amazon?
I was basically forced to watch this by its persistence in my recommendations
"𝕎𝕙𝕪 𝕕𝕠𝕖𝕤 𝕓𝕒𝕟𝕒𝕟𝕒 𝕔𝕒𝕟𝕕𝕪 𝕥𝕪𝕡𝕚𝕔𝕒𝕝𝕝𝕪 𝕟𝕠𝕥 𝕥𝕒𝕤𝕥𝕖 𝕝𝕚𝕜𝕖 𝕓𝕒𝕟𝕒𝕟𝕒𝕤?"  𝘽𝙚𝙘𝙖𝙪𝙨𝙚 𝙞𝙩'𝙨 𝘾𝘼𝙉𝘿𝙔, 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙞𝙙𝙞𝙤𝙩. 𝙄𝙛 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙬𝙖𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙩𝙤 𝙩𝙖𝙨𝙩𝙚 𝙖 𝙗𝙖𝙣𝙖𝙣𝙖, 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙚𝙖𝙩 𝙖 𝙗𝙖𝙣𝙖𝙣𝙖.
I have to say that the Chiquita company sounds pretty great. Who wouldn't want to do business with a company responsible for thousands of deaths and for funding paramilitary death squads?
Thank you, YouTube, for recommending me a banana video.
5:35 A-peel
This is the only reason I'm traveling to Florida
amazing channel along with excellent information regarding food and some botanical/agronomist information. It was a pleasure to watch it!   And I've never seen in Brazil a candy like that! Really caught my attention!
I've never heard banana so many times before, he's very enthusiastic about it
Actual banana flavour is disgusting but I love the artificial banana
Not the video i searched, but boy am I glad I watched.
The only thing that really taste like banana is ..., MARIE BRIZARD NUMBER 12 BANANA LIQUOR SINCE 1755
You know ive heard a lot of terrible things of floridians. I have learned much since starting to watch your videos today, but my favorite lesson is the reminder that not all is what it seems. I am truly touched to see good men finding simple joy in their profession.
I ordered some of the peach and black currant hard candy a couple of years ago. It actually gets better with age. Aged it by accident. Really good stuff.
9:30 lol the kid loses his candy
the banana looks like a worm
I ORDERED SOME BANANA CANDY! IT'S MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!
If you’re reading this then you probably are watching at 3 am and never ever wondered why banana candy doesn’t taste like bananas
I keep thinking of "Monoculture" by "Soft Cell"
How do you cut so fast?
9:31 is just a cinematical masterpiece
9:32 The kid dropped the candy-
imagine beeing one of those kids watching him cut the "candy sticks" they must've been mind blown :D
I have an intolerance to Artificial flavoring so video’s like this make me sad
Now thats bananas
My husbamd amd I were jist talking today about whether that odd "banana" flavor is supposed to taste like the pre-Cavendish. I just knew Greg would have a video about this!
This guys got a freaking anvil
Mr Beast: Ok 20 Million Banana Trees
Lol forget the hard candy I wanna eat that stuff at 1:15

So I wasted my hard earned money on NOT banana flavored candy

9:30 RIP boys candy!
Dropped the kids candy at 9:31 😂

Bananas
This place is so good I live here
I like bananas because they have no bones
Man, I don’t know how this got on my feed but I do appreciate it. Reminds me when I would go to Michigan to visit my dad’s family. How home town feeling and retro it was.
Dang why didn’t I learn of this place back when I used to frequent Tallahassee lol
6:55 dude just blew my mind... I been eating bananas all wrong all this time lol
yes indeed an entire sate in australia lost 99% of its banana plantations in just 1 1/2 year! the fungus is called panama disease tropical race 4
good video but please do some research about pronunciation.   it's "gro michelle"  and "ka-venn-dish"
that looks super hard
really nobody saw the scissor throw at 6:00 flat? :O
i do not know why this was recommended to me. ive never seen this channel before. but i do not have a problem with it. thanks youtube.
"Gross Michael" It's pronounced "Grow Michelle"
love this mans energy
What did you do today? I learned how i should peel a banana!!
7:45 this is where it gets weird.
Loves bananas so much, he can't pronounce the names properly,.. lol
I used to watch these all the time! Rewatching this I know why because it’s so relaxinggg...
How does uk stick's of rock have words inside them from tip to tip? I loved these sweets as a kid, when family goes to brit sea side the kids beg BRING ME BACK SOME STICKS OF ROCK. Its poor quality now days tho soft crap. They should be rock hard tooth busters.
wow those are some chopping skills
It's a gros michel. Pronounced "gross michelle"
09:30 watch this moment when kid drops his candy out of his hands
omg it was amazing
So weird, he mentions I-10 in Florida.  I live pretty close to I-10, in CA.
This vuyis very into bananas
Came to watch banana candy, left with knowledge of bana anatomy
I enjoyed this video
"gross michael" lol isn't it pronounced "grow michelle?" either way it's funny to hear it called gross michael, like obv we aren't going to use flavoring of that nasty taste, haha.
9:32 he didn't catch the candy !!  lmaoo
9:30 idk why but seeing the kid droping the candy at the end made me laugh so hard
Watched again for a minute straight trying to figure out what the guy was singing under the narrator, until the pause when I heard Rockin’ Robbin... I was hopelessly hoping for it to have been Bananarama...
Public Displays of Confection? Even if I ended up hating this candy and/or video, you get a like just for the name right off the bat 👌
I live in Tallahassee these guys put factory made candy to shame. So MUCH flavor!
I love banana, love banana candy... I got order some now. Check out their website as they have a bunch of candy that looks great.
That kid at the end dropping the candy had me laughing
Never learned so much about bananas in one sitting
'our yellow wrap is what gives our banana candy its great a-peel"
"Doesn't taste like artificial banana" -- immediately bought a bag
I mean it tastes ENOUGH like a banana to where you could tell its banana, but is still different from a real banana
God damn you YouTube for trapping me down a rabbit hole of candy videos with your "recommendations".
9:32
Hello, I would like to apply for the position of Flavor Tester please.
I keep coming back to this mesmerizing video. I don’t know what it is but I really want some of that candy 🍭 i appreciate this mans dedication to bananas
wholesome banana man
wait how do you make  a banana
All I eat at home is beans and that looks so good
The more of your videos to watch, the more I want to make the 6 hour drive just to see this shop. Can I meet the guy making the video??
Grow Me Shell
this video was way more amazing than i was ever anticipating
*banana philosophy*
9:31 kid drops candy lol
You want me to watch a banana video, youtube? I'll watch the banana video with the nice narrator.
Did anyone else notice the kid that dropped the candy 😂
Seriously... who hit the dislike button? I just wanna talk. What could you possibly dislike about this???
Sends *cutting* part to ex:
If you like banana's, you may consider visiting the Canary Islands. They have a tremendous variety of bananas. Tenerife is my favorite island.
Realy DELICIUS!!!
I absolutely hate bananas.
i learned a lot about bananas i just dont now how did i got here
9:09  LoL, did that kid in the background say "Thats how fast I chomp down on M&Ms"  Kid is legend
How'd you get George Clooney to narrate??
watching them do this in person and getting to eat it is even better
Its not Gros Michael, its "Gros Michel" pronounced as the female name Michelle...
You said both banana varieties wrong   Also the banana peeling technique is a scam
The narrator is a fusion version of Gordon Ramsay and Deadpool
This is a good video!
Do you use natural food colour or is it a chemical dye
lol i dont understand how this video has dislikes :()
I keep thinking it's a big piece of wax
<3
Best recommendation ever!! Banana facts!!
The banana issue is actually extremely present right now.
I just want to eat all that. ugh looks DELICIOUS💕
You said Banana 178 times
9:24 - 9:33  Poor kid
well now I know bananas can be poked and be split into three
Larry seems to be a bad employee.
For a second I liked the video but now I am a bit disappointed that I cannot see anywhere  bananas being mentioned as being the 3th largest crop in the world:(
I love how you guys at lofty pursuits take candy off the hook after pulling I watch some videos that they pull and theres candy left on the hook it's a waste
At 9:32 the kid doped his candy
This is the channel I didnt know I needed
How about "mystery flavor" sushi roll candy?
Why don't they teach this at schools?!
i think he likes bananas, can't be too sure though.
*Lofty going to cut the hard candy rods* Lofty: The fastest hand in the west
If all your videos are as charming and informative as this one I will probably spend quite a lot of time watching this channel in the near future.
9:32 anyone see the kid drop it 😂😂
9:07 it sounded like the kid said " that's how fast I chomp down on your nips" but I'm pretty sure he said nibs
I cant wait till our next michigan trip so I can stop by and finally taste some of your treats!
Bananas are good for muscle growth. It has a chemical that helps muscle grow
Who else thought this is one of those this is what the FDA allows in your food videos
Why am I watching this at 2:24 AM on a school night??
Bananas for bananas   Ahh how blessed wwe are
Perfect opportunity to use the song I like bananas wasted smh
One way to save banana is GMO
Wow
Here I come to say something good about something disappearing-   Bananas bring fruit flies- Yes- It is true-
I love the videos and I learned so much new things about bananas and candy making and how kind you are <3
I learned how to properly peal bananas from this video. This channel is awesome.
I have a banana tree in my yard on the Oregon coast. It is only about 6 feet tall right now, so it will be several years before it produces any fruit. lol
Did you know that bananas are radioactive but don't worry their not harmful
9:31 poor kid hahahh
i think bananas won't die because there is a global seed vault in svalbard
I still get the strands from flower end.
I could watch you chop that candy all day! You make all of that look too easy but I know it's not.
Gros Michel are pronounced Grow Michelle. Not Gross Michael.
Bananas were almost decimated because everyone farmed 1 single strain And nobody learned a damn thing
*_m i l d  b a n a n a_*
This is the most satisfying and entertaining thing I've ever seen. I could watch this for hours
This really made me want to get up and eat a banana while I still can
Is it bad that i haven't tasted a banana split yet? 😅
Why am I here? Idk why but I love it!
a documentary on bananas 🤭
I got this and the Forbidden Fruit  2, both are delicious!
I would love to see a tour of the store
is it crazy that I have never had a banana split?
Thank you for existing.
YouTube loves this candy dude
i came here for candy, i stayed for banana facts.
lol everyone opens them wrong... but draws them correctly in the cartoons lol
9:31 the kid dropped the banana candy 😂 But that's ok, I'm sure he still got to eat one
Before I even want to watch,  banana candy tastes different than normal bananas. Their was species of banana that this flavor is from that went extinct.
Cutting that candy with those shears looks like the most pleasant experience.
This candy is amazing, and kinda tangy once you get to the middle.  Its a different banana flavor for sure, but it's great and makes your mouth water for more!
I want to make a soda shop now.
... gross michael?
9:32 that kid didn't get any
YouTube told me to watch this video, and now I’ve watched over a dozen candy making videos from a candy shop on the other side of the country. Maybe it’s getting late...
The banana splitting into threes could be the Fibonacci sequence. You start with 0 and 1, then add the last number with the current number (0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55...). 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8, so on and so forth. Most plants follow this pattern in one way or another: flower petals, leaves, and seed patterns (count the number of spirals in each direction on a sunflower and it will follow the pattern) all have numbers that follow it. More info here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html  Anyways, love your videos and would love to visit someday!
Ok, so my soul is getting satisfied and I’m learning history! What more could you want?!?
youve been blessed by the algorithm, ive had this in recommended videos for MONTHS now, but you absolutely deserve it. Very fun, wholesome and entertaining
Just bought the banana candy... So worth the wait. I need to take it easy because I don't have much of it. It does taste like a banana and I love it. It's my favorite flavor of Taffy but banana hard candy blows that Taffy out of the saltwater! (That was a stretch but pun intended) Please keep making the banana flavor. There really is nothing that comes close to it.
I just found this channel and I like it but I wish the reveal was longer haha even if there's not much to reveal, add someone describing the flavor to us lol
I like to eat eat eat apples and bananas
!! I love that artificial banana flavour, I wonder if I would like gross Michael
I feel like im being told a story by my grandpa
This was really entertaining and wholesome.
Can you make a playlist of music? Your music taste is great
i love this video
Looks good, you clearly put a lot of work into making candy, but I just can’t stand bananas. How about a citrous hard candy video?
Okay. I've watched the video a month ago, today my candy arrived all the way to Germany from Lofty Pursuit in Florida <3 I love it <3
i love what you do
Very underrated channel. Amazing Content keep doing what your doing. C: (I love bananas) xddd
Mmmmmmm imma order some
why did i watch this help
Just got my banana and pickle candy in the mail today. Thanks youtube.
Really interesting. Bananas are dying the dangers of monoculture. This problem also facing the big cats in Africa as generic diversity is not naturally occurring as once was due to limited habitats. But getting back to bananas. You might be interested to know a little country right at the bottom of the world is looking at the viability of commercially growing bananas. We are developing cultivars that will do well here. Here's hoping. I loved pulled sweets especially the designs inside flowers fruits etc   But it's sugar and I do have a sweet tooth but really have to control my addiction.
When he said " a peeling" I got chu
the way you cut the banana candies. So satisfying and fast ;D
Ok, so I’m thinking, “oh yeah banana candy cool,” then I hear this... “LET’S TALK ABOUT BANANA HISTORY.”  I have mixed emotions now.. I’m not mad.
I recommend the ham and cheese sandwich there it is THE BEST
I'm sssoooooo hungry from this
GOOD JOB
bananas are gross but i love runts
So in sweden we have a place called gränna. Gränna is the swedish kingdom of candy. For us swedes det är i småland
Chicken or chicken
5:25 looks like a hotdog
5:35 Was that a pun?      apPEEL?
9:32 at 0.5 speed 😂😂😂
My order just came!!! Oh my is it good!
I love the clasical music in the backround. It really pulls you back to the 90's if its wrong secousse Me!
I want to come to your store so much but i live in sweden
hmm, I didn't notice the first time but if the banana is our 4th source of food i'm pretty much sure the most produced banana is not the one we eat in europe and probably the US. many culture consume banana as their many source of calories and they are more likely to use the cooking banana (plantain) which doesn't have much taste un less cooked.
between these videos and all the jiggly cake videos that keep showing up in my recommendeds i can't tell if youtube is saying i should cut back or increase my sugar intake.     oh well, no bother waxing philosophic, might as well just subscribe
Anyone els loving the fact that they have Rockin Robin playing!Love that song
9:32 that kid wanted that candy so bad and it fell down...
I wanna try these so bad
Say candy one more time
This guy would be the perfect grandad
Here’s a drinking game: take a shot every time he says banana
I used to be a productive member of society but now I spend all my free time watching candy videos and planning road trips to Tallahassee. 100% worth it.
Very informative video, confirmed what I already thought! I believe Vsauce mentioned this, but I might be mistaken.
sometimes i find very over ripe banana can almost taste like the banana candy, bananas are also a berry right?
The thumbnail looks like you cut into a vegetable and there was a worm inside.
Love the history you always give! Most people have no idea that most of the fruits and vegetables that we eat didn't start off the way they are now, like carrots they used to be either whitish yellow or purple before they cross bred them. Agriculture is the oldest profession.
'Cuz you eatin' earwax.
5:28 looks like a hot dog
This embodies the old saying, "Do what you love and you'll never be disappointed"
When ur 2 hrs away and suddenly nEED ur banana candy
Sometimes, youtube does a good. This is one of those times (Also I hate myself now for never realizing I've been eating bananas wrong)
so you guys peel bananas from the stem? i always did the flower end
Hah i was doing it right
So much sugar. As an adult, I look for any reason to prevent spending money. Eating this candy would make my dentist rich.
RIP the kid at 9:32 who dropped his banana candy
Superb video. Thank you.
Lmao the last kid couldn’t hold it
why has he made me so scared for bananas         _I don't even like bananas_
Found this by complete random accident. It was very insightful and surprisingly relaxing and I soon found myself stuck in a state of nostalgia of my own childhood and how candy played a huge role in my life as a youngster. I also admire the way you cut up the pieces of candy, all by hand, no machines; that's true love and dedication for what you do for a living. If I'm ever in Tallahassee I'll come make a visit.
Watched it. Not mad. Good job Youtube.
When you are cutting the candy, is it in real time?
You sound so passionate about what you do
Very interesting! I learned a lot today...
Is that a candy anvil     That’s perfect
Am I the only one who got a banana because of this video?
I could watch your slicing the banana candy into bits on repeat
I mostly just want to bite every point you cut with scissors
1:46 reminds me of Charlie and the chocolate factory when the gum guy was stretchin the gum
"The proper way to peel a banana is to do it from the flowering end"     Mario Kart had it right all along.
I don’t know why but I thought in the thumbnail of this video there was a tiny worm in the candy.
8:01 satisfaction in 3.2..
i’m watching this in 2019 and the music is kinda similar 🧐🧐
i dont know what this is but i definently LOVE this thank you for making this (i may actually go to the store)
This is cool and educational. I love candy and I use bananas as a facial treatment and eat them. If I pass through y'all area I'll be there. Also that's the best cutting I've ever seen woww.
Welcome back to why is this in my recommended?
9:31 he didn't get it :(
Why did Youtube bring me here? Is this tangentially related to Rick & Morty?
OK ARE YOU HAPPY NOW YOUTUBE
Me:hey this is a pretty relaxing video White girls:AsMr 0mG
you guys are bananas about bananas
that taffy pull clip was satisfying
I’d love to work here when I’m older, but I’m from the uk.
Why was I recommended this
the kid in the end with a white striped shirt didnt get candy
Very informative video! I never knew that there are more than 3 types of banana. Where are you guys located? Looks like a good place to snake at.
This is so informative. I love it.
My rabbits are hearing him say banana and they're staring at me..
9:19 Left most kid likes the candy a lot.
I want to eat a Big Mike bananna
Just got my banana candy, and it really is delicious and different. You did a marvelous job of capturing the flavor of the modern banana. I had to re-watch the video while eating the candy :-) highly recommended experience.
5:39 largest herb = doesnt have a woody stem? but why do bananas I eat have woody stems?
If they like bananas, they'll love me
I should be doing homework right now but instead I'm learning about bananas
I like bananas too
The candy tastes like banana to me. Probably because it's because I hate bananas.
I got the same fan at home :)
i clicked one video of bananas now everything that is recommended to me are videos about bananas
Man, it's gonna drive me crazy that I can't just walk on over into Florida to try some of this. I would hate to have to order it because I'ld wanna chill with the crew too. I love it when a place has it's own history to it, even if it's about food.
Youtube recommended this to me. Honeatly this is interesting but overlaying your voice like that over Tons of sounds is very ear annoying.
well i immediately ordered a bag of these, so i guess this is a damn good ad
Donkey Kong wants to know your location
dude thats crazy ive been here a thousand times and i live in tally.  i cant believe it has this many views
I live really close to this place and I love coming here
K but can we talk about how great a voice this guy has?
9:31 kids drops the candy
why do you choose the chop anvil method for the cutting process instead of a slam down thing?
Nanners, I’m sure the yeetga-clan would love it 🍌
I'm coming down there just because of a youtube recommendation
well didn't expect to learn this much about bananas but hell if i care it was NEAT
My GOD! I'd PAY to be the one to cut the sugary mass with those scissors! Looks like a great sensation!   Can I purchase your products via Amazon? I've never seen them in Swedish stores!
9:30 lol kid is so excited for a piece then he drops it lmaoo
I just have to ask, have you ever had the "Oh god no" moment when you poured out the candy mix and either had too much or something was wrong with the metal bars holding it in and molten hot sugar proceeded to pour all over the floor?
Youtube recommended this to me. I didn't ask for it, but now I know more about banana flavoring. Thanks youtube.
Your arm muscles must be HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE
This is what the internet was made for, for people who have true passion.
I’ve never learned so much about bananas ever before than in this video
9:32 sad rick and morty music plays in backround
Okay Youtube, I'll watch it! ):÷(
Lemme just grab a banana real quick
Uses anvil for banana candy   "Conan.  Do you know the 'riddle' of banana candy?"
lol at 9:30
I don't think I like bananas
Love these, was very much worth an order
I wish I could still eat bananas
I would love to see this store in a fallout game
i didnt think i could be so ignorant with bananas. this video fixed that!
That trilaterally symmetrical part is really interesting! Never would have known that.
I learned 1 thing while watching this video is that bananas used to taste better
_Gros michel_ is not pronounced like "gross Michael" lmao
I’m from Australia and flew all the way there to try the candy I promise it taste like the best candy I’ve ever had
Lol all these people never knew how to eat w banana the Greeks knew
Banana flavored candies are my favorites
He's like the Tim Gunn of candy.
I blame freelee
I just had to sub for some strange reason!
Can you ship to Japan?  I'm on a amarican ship though,  idk if that makes any difference on if it's considered a different country or not
the candy in the this thumbnail looks like a cucumber with a slug in it.
As soon as he started chopping the candy, I heard absolutely nothing because I was too distracted by the actual chopping.
This video has inspired me to always peel the banana short-end first.
“Let’s talk about the history of bananas!”  Me: (While reclining on a red plush chaise lounge) I’m listening...
Why in the world would you deliberately press the dislike button
You consistently mispronounce both Cavendish and Gros Michel.
Do you guys think those children are hypnotized by all that candy or the guy's chopping speed?
Thought provoking and wholesome, I came for the candy but stayed for the great commentary!
This is satisfying af 🍌
I've heard the word 'banana' so many times that I don't think it's a real word anymore
Thanks for the appealing video!
AND there's an online website? Shut up and take my money!
Hahah, that kid was really eager to get some candy, he got it but... 9:30
9:31 Mission failed  Well get them next time
As someone who doesn't even like bananas the way the candy is formed is satisfying
Well this was just delightful
POOR KID AT THE END LMAO
i could totally binge these
BIG QUESTION!!!  When he cuts the candy, arent there like still quiet pointy or sharp edges? Isnt that kinda dangerous?
8:03 satisfying 😍
i love banana candy   but i hate bananas
This man sure is passionate about his bananas
The yellow rap is what gives your banana candy such great a peal ?? Haha ! Am I the only one who caught that I think it was unintentional but punny nonetheless
Because bananas used to taste different better perhaps instead of this homogenized banana we now have
I’ve had really ripe bananas that taste like the artificial bananas
FINE YouTube I'll click the damn video about banana candy not tasting like bananas. Happy?!
I'm supposed to be making an essay for English, but whatever
HOW IS THIS BIG IN MY TOWN HAHAHA
If anyone finds the facts about bananas interesting I would highly recommend a documentary called "Fruit Hunters" or the book it's based on. You will come out with more fruit facts than you know what to do with.
The way this man talks is extremely charismatic lol, I watched the whole thing 0% bored
Loved to see how hand made candy is done. Looks tasty and thanks for the information about the candy. Would like to taste it some day, especially knowing it's not the "old" flavor and hand made :D
Idk why this was in my recommendations but that is for the banana tips
Best commercial ever.
currently suffering from depression and while in the middle of one my break downs i spotted this video and it surprisingly made me feel better. thank you bananas, very cool.
9:30 YOU DROPPED THE KIDS CANDY
This is nearly as relaxing to watch as that video of the guy melting down range lead and spooning the dirt out
sugary sugar
what's the name of the song in 9:15?
Look at the kid at 9:30
Ill give ya a banana
Thank you
when i watch your videos my teeth root start rumbling
Strange. YouTube recommended a video that isn't cringe or clickbait.
Ｃ　Ｏ　Ｍ　Ｆ　Ｙ
The narrator is so nice and really loves his job. This just warmed my heart.
Very educational and informative!
Hello reccomendation squad.
Now I want a banana
Some times youtube algorithm actually does something right. This video was interesting, I am in your website now looking to buy some banana candy, I hope you guys do send to Sweden
I learned I've been peeling bananas wrong for 30 years.  Loved it.
Same old story, I have no idea why I`m here, but hey great video, I would love to try those candy someday
I love these old fashioned candy makers and soda fountains and really wish there was more shops like this.
9:31 - 9:33   lol..
I live on the tampa bay so its a bit of a drive but maybe i should visit this place if im ever up in Tallahassee.
pronounced  "Grow Michele", these look awesome
Gros Michel is pronounced Groh Michelle not gross Michael.  Also, there are dozens of varieties of bananas, the one you get in North America is one with the best shelf life. If the Cavendish dies out due to disease a new hybrid will be created, which will make me happy because the Cavendish is the miller lite of bananas.  The candy making part was pretty cool though.
YouTube recommendations did a good  +1 sub
Take a shot each time he says banana.
This man has given me a reason to go to Tallahassee.
take a shot every time he says banana
9:30 that’s a oh no moment
Banana pi orbital at 4:30  (chemistry joke)
I’m moving to Tallahassee, I’m there all the time... I’ve been here😂
banana candy is the worst
At first time i thought that is a maggot shape
Man this is such a smart way to make a "how its made" food video.  Undoubtable you will always have long stretches of footage that take much less time to explain.  The way you transitioned between what you were doing and additional info, back to what you were doing, was so seamless and pleasing.  Often I start videos like this but x out halfway in.  This was too engaging for me to quit, and I didn't even feel dirty afterwards like I normally do from idle clicking.  Just a nourishing, well-made video I suppose.
Hi
Watching the candy get cut into bite-size pieces was very satisfying, and thank you for teaching me the correct way to peel a banana, I'm dying to try it.
Came for the banana hard candy, stayed for the interesting history lesson about how bananas are at risk of going extinct due to monoculture
CAN YOU STOP RECOMMENDING ME THIS NOW!???! THERE I WATCHED IT NOW LEAVE ME ALONE
Nanners
Ive watched this once a year ago and this is still interesting to re watch for some reason.
Not gonna lie this is pretty interesting.
He said the yellow outer part was the most a'peal'ing part of their candy lol
8:30 damn he quick
Don't know why this was recommended to me but I'm really glad I watched it.
This has been in my recommend for a week now...ARE YOU HAPPY NOW, YOUTUBE?!
SAM-e
Did you get your script from The Sci Show?
Aww i lived in tally for 5 years and i didn't know you were there! I plan on moving back, and I'll be sure to come there all the time!
I found the Narrator's voice so pleasant I watched the entire video.
Bananas have a great "a-peel".  Ha, see what you did there.  *Cue Laugh Track* This is what I get for watching punny videos.  👍👍
That was really interesting and informative. Kind of surprise me to hear you say we may not have bananas in the future. Also it's interesting to learn about how fruit/veggies have evolved and how what we eat today is different. Very cool video. I really would love to visit your shop some day.
I thought that was a worm in the banana
no comments? :O
5:43 it looks like a hot dog
Because banana
a well earned like
So anyone else from Tallahassee?
Best recommendation ever?
I have not seen one of these candies since I was a kid in the 1970's christmas candy's 💝💝💝💝😊
In in Jacksonville. I can’t wait to come & see one day.
Looks good....
I can confirm we do have bananas in the future
I wish I loved anything as much as this man loves bananas.
No idea why this was reccomended to me but I still watched. Never knew there were different species of bananas lol I thought it had just changed it's flavour over time because of selective breeding. I'll never taste those banana shaped gummies the same way again haha   *_+ Banana Points_*
I had no idea about that banana peeling tip. I've always hated those banana strands, but now I know how to avoid them. Love the candy making by the way.
If I’m ever by Florida I’ll definitely go here the ice cream and candy looks so good
Yeetus Memetus Bananas are Neatus.
9:32 windows XP stopped working
First I was watching a Russian music video from 1979 now this. Why
"..and letting us know if they liked it or not. They liked it." *Candy awkwardly falls out of the kids hand when he gives it to him.*
Ok so i live in florida i might drive to Tallahassee to try this out
Oh, exactly 10 minutes. What are the odds. /sarcasm
Gross Michael? No. it's Gros Michel and since it's French it's pronounced like Grow Michelle
Banana-flavored Runts are the worst candy. Gros Michel bananas are wonderful, however. Still not gonna eat banana candy. >:(
I like the artificial banana candy flavor. I'll eat a banana when I want natural banana flavor
Damn I want some they look so frikin delishius hhhhhhhhhhhh
9:31 Kid had his hand out for so long, only for the the sweet treat to fall right out of his banana-candy-less hands.
YouTube has been listening to my conversations again.  Very satisfying watch anyway!
The biggest question isn’t Why was this recommended to me by YouTube?, it’s why did I sit all the through the 10 minute video YouTube recommended about candy that I’ve never thought about watching???
I wonder if hes ever rolled to far causing the candy to fall on the floor
9:31 rip Candy
I could watch this video a million times Especially 8:01
What's that song in the background?
1:10 looks like honey
Lol that poor kid dropped his piece!
Its "grow meeshell"
from cute chihuahua to hand made 🍬
How is the flavoring extracted?  Is the banana squeezed?  Do you...  make banana cry?
I hate banana.
Gros Michael is pronounced more like Groe Mickel
honestly don't understand youtube's recommendation system but ok
"But it is a banana story, and I'm gonna stick with it." Bless you, banana man, where ever you are.
at 9:31 when the candy falls out of that kids hand i felt his pain
This video talks about so much more than just the candy and I love it I am subscribing This is fantastic
I got this video randomly recommended. I come here to find an interesting video about the history of bananas with a guy making candy in the background. Subbed.
Why did this video get so many dislikes? I dont like banana but the candy making process is cool and the guy is nice and informative!
Crazy thing, I was just eating a banana, and YouTube recommended me this. I think I'm being watched...
From the side, the sweets look like banana coins from DK64.
did I just end up watching a 10 minute video about banana candy
Okay okay, I took the YouTube recommendation to watch this video. I'm fascinated and going to share it everywhere now!  So much banana info!! And, what a fantastic ad for his candy shoppe! I was road tripping through Florida last month, and I'm truly saddened I didn't know about this place before setting off on the trip.
interesting...
My mouth is watering!
9:31 mission failed
yo this dudes one of those god level fast workers 8:10
9:32 Fail
9:32 they cut it out cause he dropped it
sweet place to visit next time~
You may want to start pronouncing Gros Michael the correct way (Grow Michelle) so people don't misunderstand any connotations that the American pronunciation has.
I swear this video is like "can you cast obsidian" 2.0
I  know it's hot and all, but I want this poured down my mouth
this man looks like the kindest man in the whole world and I would buy treats from him
Dude I would travel through multiple states just to meet this man w all these banana facts and enjoy some candy and ice cream while listening to him go on and on enthusiasticly about literally any subject bc I love the passion. There isn't a single thing I dislike about this video. The music is even on point! He even mentioned the Velvet Underground for corn's sake
"Gross Michael?" That's a french name, it's pronounced like "grow Michelle."
Wtf That's crazy how the get the banana imagine in there
I thought that banana in the candy was a maggot 😂
Its a beautiful channel. Its soothing and informative and makes me want to order a lot of their candy!
The youtube banana twilight zone got me too. But it was a great video and well put together. I also learned the "proper" way to open a banana.
It's because the "Banana"they use is an older relative of the normal Cavendish banana.
YUMMMMMMMM
9:31 dropped it 😂😂
It looks like a worm lol
I used to love bananas as a child but now I don't. Could it be they changed flavor? Love artificial banana flavor though! Banana laffy taffy is the best.
Do American's realize the word herb has an h in it? Why do they all say erb lol
I keep watching this channel and now I really wanna go to the shop but I live on the other side of the country :(
I don't understand why this was reccomended so much... but i'm not complaining.
Thank you for explaining to me why I have always hated banana flavoured sweets (candies). Yes the flavour is too strong, sort of bitter, nothing like a fresh banana. I love fresh bananas so I always assumed it was just because it was an artificial flavouring that I found it so foul. I'm sure your candy is delicious though! Best wishes from the UK. X
This guy is bananas about bananas!
10 minutes of glory
WHY AM I WATCHING A GUY MAKE BANANA CANDY WHEN I SHOULD BE WRITING MY FINALS
This video is absolutely bananas.
BEEEYYNN
how many times did he say banana?
This is the most wholesome video I've seen in a long time. Wow.
I always liked these 'loyal' customers that bring their kids to their favorite candy shop
You just gained a like for teaching me the history of bananas
Wholesome.
wish someone loved me like this guy loves bananas
Bad bot
STOP RECCOMENDING THIS TO ME YOUTUBE
This was an intellectual and emotional journey
You happy Youtube? I finally watched it.
Yes, I am also here from Youtube recommendations, Just like everyone else in the comments.
Man loves his bannanas
Good lord that man can chop
This is very neat id love to get some of this candy/visit this place
Bananas are bilaterally symmetrical, despite being segmented into 3 parts.  This has to be the case as it has a bend shape rather than being cylindrical like a cucumber.
"It would be a much sadder place if the world did not have banana splits" :'(
and yet, Juicy Fruit Gum does taste kinda like bananas
If I ever visit the USA, I want to go to this place! Taste their naturally-flavoured banana candy, and other candy too, if I can! I really didn't know banana fans were a thing, but this is really just so charming. This was an awesome video.
A huge Advertising/Tutorial/Political statement video is something I never knew would be so enjoyable.
Listening to the part of the banana song I got reminded of Homer and got sad :(
fascinating!
You have a relaxing voice
This is the most informative advertisement I have seen in a long time.
:)
Why does banana candy?
Thanks for the neat video, Greg!
9:31 "....They liked it" *Candy hits the floor*
This is Bananas.
Gros Michel is pronounced  "grow me shell"
5:32 , someone please tell me this was meant to be a pun! 🤣
That poor kid at the end there who just dropped the candy out of his arm.
I wish I was as passionate about anything as this guy is about bananas
So, I was listening to GhostMane and somehow I came here
Well, that was interesting. Nice anekdotes, good filming, charismatic narrator and really cool craftmanship! I did not expect candy making to be such a filigrane art. the way you handle the candy with such an ease remembers me of glass blowers. It always looks so easy, but i couldnt even do the tapering down part...
Why is this in my recommendation! I can't eat sugar!!! But damn it, I WANT THAT CANDY NOW!
I thought there was worms in them
I don't get, and I hate that I don't get why I am watching this, but I like it
Thanks for the banana vid youtube?
Same thing with all fruit flavored things though.
*White vans have entered the chat*
I was in Tallahasse last summer but apparently my friend didn't know you guys were here! ..  shame I missed out on visiting your place :O ..   Greets from The Netherlands
this looks like such a lovely candy cafe! Wish I could go there
Bananas are the new bees?!?!?!
I eat banana with these leftover strands._
Youtube recommended me a random video, and I quite enjoyed it. I was interested in something I never cared about, but now will.
I've always had a fascination with old fashioned candy. I wanted to be a candy maker at one point.  Although I hate bananas I would eat one of these just cause it's so awesome. And it's given me an appreciation for "banana flavoured" sweets.
I don't know why I was recommended this, but I thoroughly enjoyed this and feel like I actually learned something today. Thanks y'all!
i don't even eat much candy but i love watching it be made like this and i love the enthusiastic facts given with the video while we get to watch the process!
It's 1AM and I have to study for an exam...
Hmmm i likeeee bananasssss💋🙈🙈
This was very pleasant
I didn't even know I needed this thank you
"it would be a much sadder place if the world did not have banana splits" FACTS
That was simply beautiful :D The story, the technique, the work ethic, the narration. If i am ever visiting the States and more specifically Florida, i will definitely be stopping by this place!
You've taken your viewers back to a simpler time!  Thank you!
The way you say the soft ‘i’ sound (in cavendish, symmetry) is nice
Artificial banana flavour tastes like banana skin to me. Have to say never heard of this candy here in the uk
I'm glad this was in my recommendations
Just got mine in the mail today and honestly I’m addicted can’t stop eating them and the same goes for my girlfriend with the crystal roses
TL;DW: Banana candy flavoring is derived from a species of banana that has since gone extinct, said species having a distinct flavor from the usual domesticated banana. The only way to experience the flavor of this lost species of banana is through the leftover formula for the candy flavor, and imitations, which is probably why most candymakers refuse to move on to a more "accurate" flavor.  As for grape candy, you got me there- I have no goddamn clue why it tastes different.
oddlysatisfying
What
Thanks youtube i guess......
Your passion about bananas makes me happy. Your content is sweet so I’ll be looking forward seeing more of your god stuff :)
Subbed.
Thank you so much! I bought these for my boyfriend as a valentines day gift and he LOVED them and he (funny enough) bought me the ROSE ones! We bond over these videos and thank you for making us happy with your incredible candy
Poor boy 9:31
Alright, I'm convinced by this one video. If I end up in Tallahassee at any point in my life, I'll buy some candy.
I want banana
Anyone look at the Recipe Book and think of Cheryl by Yung Gravy?
*Man, hearing you talk about history while you make your products is such an amazing concept, just loved it!*
bananas are trilaterally symmetric since it's a monocot. monocots have ovaries in multiples of three which gives it that shape when split
Fine youtube, I’LL WATCH THE DAMN VID OKAY?!!
how did i get here....why would I want to watch a video about making can..........can't ......look away.......
I honestly miss bananas. ;-; Some of the medication I take make my body unable to process potassium, so bananas make me feel really sick when I eat them.
Who peels a banana from the stem?
he is the smartest candy maker in the world... that was like a thesis on bananas
Wow, how interesting! I'm glad I stumbled across your video. I almost didn't watch because I thought I already knew how candy was made....but now, dude, I'm a subscriber! tfs
Why can't ads just be like this. You learn something, and they get to appeel to the audience. Win/win.
Well Thats Bananas! 🍌 😂😂🔥👌
Fine, YouTube.... I'll *watch* the damn video!!   Here.  Y'happy now !?!?!?
Dunno why I am watching this but its awesome
This video is *bananas*
Alright, I've watched it. Back off YouTube
Song name? It makes me happy and idk why
I learn more from a video about bananas and candy then I do at school
The narrator's voice is so relaxing and calming but not in a asmr way
I've never had bananas before..
I really want a banana now
Top Banana!
Soo bananas are clones
Even though I knew a bit about the artificial flavoring, banana diseases, how to peal a banana, and also regardless of my distaste for bananas I REALLY enjoyed this video. If I ever have the chance to go visit, I will. Great work! I am glad I got recommended this for whatever bazaar reason.
Things like this that I find on my recommended list and these comments sections make me complete and the reason why I love YouTube so darn much
This has been the most wholesome video I’ve ever watched.  I feel at ease. Also I loooove the ‘fake’ banana flavor personally !! I always get my friends’ banana Laffy taffy! But It’s s cool to know where the heck it came from
Yes, YouTube kept putting it in my "Recommended for you". And, I didn't know why and kept avoiding it. I gave in tonight. And YouTube was right! It was interesting, entertaining,  educational, and I like it and Subscribed. I wonder what is next?!?!...
0:54 Those are some epic scissors!
I've lived in Florida all my life and never knew about this place. Next time I go to Tallahassee I'll be sure to stop by!
I just received my order and the banana candy is amazing!
Does this guy like bananas?
Gros Michael Bananas, potatoes in Ireland, and now the current banana. When will we EVER learn not to monoculture????
Very satisfying to watch. Great facts too!
take a shot of banana liqueur every time he says 'banana'
heartbreak at 9:31
Bananas are still here now
I feel like I've been lied to. like there was this big banana catastrophe that I was never told about. I just wanted to watch some guy make candy, but instead, I'm being told bananas might go extinct? what?
tbh I'd listen to audio books or other narration by this guy
they're like yellow recorders
Alright YouTube, you win.😒
There's always money in the banana candy stand.
As a kid I always noticed that "banana-flavored" food tastes nothing like bananas, and now I know why! Thanks.
I came here at random from my usual art vids. Honestly i dont like artificial banana but bananas are life. Loved the additional facts too. Sometimes YouTube detours turn out quite nicely
I'm allergic to bananas :/
burning hot candy sheet... I think ill use the melty white plastic spoon....lmfao
I learned more than I thought about bananas
**starts preparing for the bananapocalypse**
If you’re gonna talk about the history of bananas you really oughta mention the intense economic imperialism that was associated with Chiquita and United Fruit. Banana Republics we’re not good things and I still don’t understand that store being named that.
Yessss velvet underground
banana vsauce
Jesus this video has been in my recommended like 10 times
Dang it you got a sale. Watching them made now I have to try some and happy to support a small candy making business.
boom im ordering this
It's awesome when someone knows every little fact about the product they work with
Why am I watching this at 4am?
This man is super smart and educational. Thank you sir!
When he started chopping the candy, like, how the f...
Damn this guy is bananas for bananas
Unicorn droppings?
I'm betting genetic modification will save bananas this time around.
Jesus Christ did I just watch a man stretching taffy on a coat rack for 2 minutes?
I don't know how I got here, but this video is AMAZING!
Who is this magic man
Where did you try the Gros Michelle banana? Ive always wanted to find one and try it.
America loves bananas... hell they had a whole war over them
I knew about peeling the banana at the other end so those gross strings don't get in the way. I feel like a banana genius
Youtube: *Has ran out of videos to recommend me*  Youtube:
That feel when your artificial banana tastes more like banana than most current bananas.
Amazing!
lovely! if i am ever in the states i am definitely going to visit!
*"but it is a banana story, and im gonna stick with it."*
Who else thought it was a maggot
You can play drinking game in this video everytime he says "Banana". Trust me, you'll be drunk before the half of this video.    Finish the video and you'll be a minion.
Thank you for this great, great video! Amazing way of infotaining! :)
I love how the guy working there is just as mesmerized by turning the candy white as we are.
I haven't eaten any kind of candy for about 5 years now. (unless you count chocolate) Now I want to try these so bad.
Bananas are monocots (I think), thus the trilateral symmetry.
I’ve never met this guy but I like him already
Now this is how you do advatising
Not sure how I ended up here, but the narrator sounds like John Malkovich.
Its great aPEAL
Oh yeah yeah Banana yeah yeah
I don't know about you guys, but I think I have a hunch on why youtube recommended me this video. my kind of video
bet you like banana splits to much
I've worked in a large candy factory where everything was automated. Well not everything.  They had the original steam tables for sugar work as shown in this video. We made the rock candy with the name of the beachside resort written through the stick of candy. (Brighton, Blackpool, etc) All of this was all built up by hand similar to what's shown in the video, but 10 times more complicated. The standing joke was that the guys on the steam tables could to do your portrait through a stick of candy.
I watched this to the end. I don't even like bananas. Now I wish I did.
corn, wheat, then potatoes idk about bananas unless you are talking about all fruit.
They make candy like this in Poland with tiny shapes of fruit and I was always curious how they did it! This is awesome.
Thank you YouTube. Finlay you recommended something interesting
Beyn's next vacation should be there XD
Great video! Interesting stuff, and I love your conversational narrative style 😄
I don't know why YouTube recommended this video, but I'm off to watch more from this channel.
This video is so wholesome
This was... surprisingly captivating? watching this man tell me facts and make old time candy just felt... right?  I have no reason to ever be near Tallahassee, but I want to go to this soda fountain. I also kind of want to quit my job and make candy.
THIS IS      B A N A N A S
5:26 it looks like a hot dog.
The name, gros michel is actually French, it's not pronounced "gross Michael", It's pronounced 'grow Michelle'.   Just a fun fact. The candies look delicious I'd love to try some myself!
I actually watched it wtf
i would not want to try that because, the middle looks like there's a gross bug inside of it. ;-;
i dont eat candy.... im here for the banana facts
The gross Michael and the kavendash.  Geezis Chris.
I'm trying my best to get my brother to visit you all.
What % of my DV of sugar do you think is in that molten slab of sugar....?
I can't stand banana flavoured lollies. I wonder if I'd feel differently about the natural flavoured lollies these guys make. I don't really like the banana species common in western countries. Last year I tried a tiny species in Thailand. They were so much nicer in my opinion.
Bananas are the best classic fruit.
the sugar drying and being peeled up and cut is the most satisfying thing I have ever seen in my entire life.
death dealer
What the?!?  Good youtube recommendations?
Thanks youtube. Thanks for giving me bananas.
WOW MY MIND IS BLOWN!!! I ALWAYS THOUGHT ARTIFICIAL BANANA TASTED THAT WAY BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIVES I HAD NO CLUE WE USED TO EAT BANANAS THAT TASTED THAT STRONG!
The "artificial" flavor was isolated from the gros michel. It is chemically identical.
That takes a lot of strength
take a shot each time he says "banana"
Alright YouTube algorithm, are ya happy?
09:31 ℍ𝕖 𝕡𝕦𝕥 𝕚𝕥 𝕚𝕟 𝕪𝕠𝕦𝕣 𝕙𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝕤𝕥𝕚𝕝𝕝 𝕕𝕣𝕠𝕡𝕡𝕖𝕕 𝕚𝕥!👌👌👌
"That's how fast I chomp down on M&M's." ... same kid
2019 and we still have bananas
I tend to avoid sugar in everything, but I really appreciate the craft and passion behind this.
Im thankful this showed up in my recommended
Is that Rocco from Mega64?
Banana candy doesn't taste like bananas because ITS ALL ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS AND THEY JUST SLAP A FLAVOR LABEL ON THERE.
This is so cool!!
The Banana Dan candy you made for my husband tasted delicious. He loved it and still talks about the design and the taste. Love your videos and your candy!
This was a great video, I learned a lot and enjoyed the candy making process
I want to vist your store so bad
Why is YouTube repeating the recommendation for this video after a year again? I remember watching this last year and clearly the ones watching then too were clueless as to why was this recommended?
I don't know how I ended up here but I'm glad I did.
I have always wanted to try a gros michel so bad.  I think you've convinced me to visit you and to finally acquire one, somehow.
The small bannanas in the middle kinda look like maggots
I never expected to sub to a... candy making channel?
*I   l o v e   b a n a n a s*
There's nothing quite as wholesome as owning a vintage candy shop.
i want these to replace my teeth
What's the music?
I have 0 inclination to visit Florida, but if I’m ever there, I’ll stop by bc this is a sweet video (pun intended)
I thought that was a fruit fly larvae in the thumbnail
huh? banana disease?
Take a shot every time he says "banana"
9:32 nice catch dumbass...     thatwasajokeforthoseshittybulliesatskoolinmovies
I’m allergic to bananas
Not sure why Youtube recommended it, not sure why I watched it, but 10/10.
you are my new hero. where can I buy this candy?
Tbh. Most candy flavours taste nothing like the actual fruit. Grape for example
Bolloccks
This is a very interesting video!! The bananas are so cute lol
No more bananas? That's how I get my potassium and prevent Charlie horses.🍌🍌🍌🍌🐴🐴🐴
Idk why tf I’m watching this. I absolutely hate bananas but I’m actually really enjoying this. Keep it up my guy. YouTube recommends the weirdest things 🤔
thought those were larvae
As if you guys had a cover of out of my head by fastball playing. This video was amazing in everyway lol
its 11:20 pm and i have a geo test tomorrow but this is so incredibly interesting
Definitely a random video recommendation. Love bananas and love banana flavored candy. Btw he chopped those candy strips wicked fast lol I thought the footage was sped up for a sec then realized he just had some serious skill. Very informational video thanks man 🙌
Absolutely the best video I never wanted to watch.
I don’t even want to come visit to buy anything, I just want to hear you talk for hours 😂😂😂 you’re probably the most entertaining person I’ve ever listened to
Okay but you explaining how peeling bananas in the black end is the right way and how bananas split evenly into three sections just kind of scared me like everything I thought to be true is a lie at this point...
Those stinking threads are a big reason I stopped liking bananas, oddly enough. XD
9:32 woopsie
Youtube's algorithm can be very strange. It sent me here after watching a vid about training Alpacas.
So cool!
Very informative
I SUSPECT it's because some varieties of bananas went extinct?
huh i never had your food or candy but now i really wanna
Dabs 🤘🤘
#SaveTheBanana
Thank you very cool
Bananas were cultivated in "Papa" New Guinea?
It's videos like this that makes me love this age of internet communication and the sharing of information. You just blew my mind, solving a mystery i've pondered since childhood.    And Greg, you sure did a fine job doing it, only thing i think could have been better is the sound quality, but otherwise it was amazing, i believe this is not only because of your way with words and your crisp, capturing persona,  but yeah, mostly it is.  Keep up the good work, and thank you/H.S from the proud country of vikings and social democracy, in other words, the country of Sweden.
I love this man. He’s so happy
Mmmmm banana facts
You freaking rock!!! Thank you for preserving these traditions and histories and for presenting them in an interesting and engaging ways!!
It looked like a maggot at first glance
the last kid that got candy immediatly dropped his peice.
Thanks YouTube. I did not come here to watch this, but now I'm leaving with some straight up facts! That I will never use in my life time.
americans....
I’ve been watching these videos since last year and I just realized it’s “Public Displays of Confection” like “Public Displays of Affection.”  I’m terminally stupid.
Unicorn droppings??? LOL!! Who could resist trying that?!
I like how you say ''Gross Michael'' when it's actually ''Gros Michel'', french for big Michel (a french surname) and pronounced grow meechell.
i have a weird feeling, that this guy likes bananas?
After watching, I just had to eat one of the bananas I had in the fruitbowl opposite the screen...
i literally did not listen to a word he said, i just watched the candy making process
I hate bananas
Damn, this dude is really passionate about candy.
6:40 mind blown
THE KID AT THE END DROPPED HIS CANDY HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I wish to one day find someone who loves me as much as this man loves bananas.
this video drove me bananas~
The wrap certainly does give it appeal
I do like artificial banana flavor, I agree it tastes artificial, and not like banana, but I still like it
Wow, you guys at Lofty Pursuits are making incredible videos! I really enjoyed this one, even though, tbh, ive never tried a banana candy. Lots of awesome facts, great candy making, and the narration is on point!!
Wow a job I’d actually look forward to going to
Yeah, I will get mad if the wrapper claimed to banana candy but taste nothing like it. I really mad about banana. Most of all I love banana juice!
9:31 the candy fell xD
One can only wonder what a Cavendish flavoured banana candy would taste like (though it’s already mentioned by the candy manufacturers in reference to their banana candies, compared to most banana candies and their classic Big Mike flavour.)
Narraration by Ethan Van Sciver.
This should not be fascinating.   It shouldnt make me care about candy production.  But it does.
Huh, turns out I've been peeling bananas right all my life :)
not sure how i got here but i enjoyed myself.  i thought you speed up the shot of you breaking the rods....sooo fast
This store looks AMAZING! If ever I'm in Tallahassee, I'll be sure to stop by.
For the love of all that is sane it isn’t “Gross Michael” it’s pronounced “grow michelle”. Gros Michel... it’s also not cavendOsh but Cavendish. Named after the Duke of Devonshire’s familial name.   I will never understand why people don’t take 2 minutes to look up the phonetic pronunciation of things they intend to speak on. It takes so little effort not to sound completely ridiculous in an “informative video”
TBH at a glance I thought the banana was a maggot
bananas
Oh.
Take a shot, every time he says bananas.
the stupid music is driving me nuts!  annoying as hell!  stopped at 1:16. i’ll look up the banana thing somewhere else. . .  🍌
I don't even like cavendishes. I don't find their flavour that complex. It goes: - green = best - yellow = meh - brown = bleh, too soft, too sweetish  But raw bananas are still gross. Cooked bananas are pretty good though. Fried are okay. Grilled are best. Cooking them with meat actually works quite well.
thats a lot of gel
Education!!!!
What a brilliant and wholesome video. Definitely subscribed!
Excellent surprise with all the info/education on bananas.  I always peeled them the right way, and thought other people did too, but noticed they peeled it from the stem end and told me wrongly that they were right
Hur dur idk y utoob recommend me da videeo but i wotch it anyweeey :3
Say “groz michelle”
Gros Michel
Take a drink every time he says banana.
Just subbed after a recommendation...  YouTube knows me so well... 🍬
Guess he's going bananas.
I literally don’t even live in Florida why am I here
8:14 dude is a machine lol
For 45 years I've peeled a banana wrong.  SMH..  I actually learned something today!  Thank you!
SimplyNailogical needs to make this for Beynnnnnn!
too sad that they use synthetic food colorings or id buy alot
5:32 I see what you did there
I live near Orlando, so Tallahassee is a long ways away from where I am, but I'll keep you guys in mind if I ever find myself up north.
That was such a great video to watch. Thanks.
Will you marry me? Or clone yourself?
Anybody else notice the boy at the right at 9:30 he had his hand out for so long then the guy accidently dropped it 😆
Very interesting!  And what a lot of work!  My arms and back hurt! lol
bob dylan
I’m not sure why this popped into my recommended but thanks YouTube 👌🏻
Okay this is Epic
It makes me really sad that you didn't talk once about the horrible human rights violations and worker exploitation of the banana companies.
This is next-level content
I would love to receive the excess products of this confectionery. 😆
9:30 ha ha no candy for the last kid.
How many times did he say banana
That's some sweet art right there, literally! ;)
Man I really wanna eat this candy now
once consumed, the potassium in bananas attracts mosquitos...    don't eat bananas in the woods
Try not to get satisfied
Well, now I know about the clockman AND banana candy. Thanks, YouTube.
Idc about the facts I’m never peeling it that way lol
Mentioning the Chiquita Banana Books recipes for banana dishes with meat that no one would eat today, that's because today's Cavendish banana is bred to be super sweet and sold in an advanced ripened stage. Earlier varieties, and everyone knows even Cavendishes when they're green, are starchy and vegetable tasting, and actually does pair well with meat and vegetables. In fact, in the Caribbean, Central America, Polynesia, Southeast Asia, Africa, green bananas have long been cooked in meat dishes and grilled, roasted and fried and treaded more like an avocado or a potato. Similar plants, like the plaintain, actually are made into fried snacks, similar to potato chips and flavored with things like salt and garlic and black pepper. Anyone who's eaten in a Cuban sandwich shop knows plaintain chips and roasted plaintain and green bananas are delicious, and are quite avocado like.
Banana candy does taste like bananas. It just doesn't taste like eating a fresh bananas because the flavour is not as concentrated. If you have ever tasted something like banana bread batter or something else with concentrated natural banana flavour you will find it tastes a lot like the flavour of banana candy.
There i watched it are you happy now?
Would you say that bananas taste like a cross between a banana and a banana? Or is it more like a banana?
Bananas taste bad
Is this the same company that made the Tide Pod candy?
*expecting a fun video about banana candy* "BANANAS ARE DYING"
Even thought I don't like bananas and live about 1000 miles from Talahassee, I really enjoyed this video. So many fun historical facts and anecdotes that we hardly ever think of now. My current hometown has an old-time soda fountain too, but only on a seasonal basis. It's been operating like that for 85 years now. I wonder how many banana splits they've served up during that time?
But what about the original bananas with seeds? They won't go extinct yet.
That's a lot of work to make hard banana candy. 🍌🍌🍌
I'm too poor to buy candy.
I’m not a fan of bananas, but you made me feel like I should appreciate them more while they’re here.
Bananas are my favorite fruit. Fun facts Lofty Pursuits! :)Jen
This is cool. I think I'll stay around to watch more
I actually learned some things about bananas from this, thank you.
Well. There goes 10 minutes of my life. But I have to admit, i enjoyed it.
WHY DID YOUTUBE RECOMMEND THIS? NOT COMPLAINING THOUGH CUS THIS WAS PRETTY COOL AND INTERESTING
6:30 - 6:32 what sorcery is this
I stopped my Physics homework to watch this lol
Why is this always in my recommended list in every video
The yellow wrap gives the banana candy it's great....a peel. ;D
This is so satisfying to watch.
ugh, fine youtube ill watch it,
Not sure why I got recommended this but I watched the whole thing and I have to say, I enjoyed learning all about bananas.
This was really informing and interesting!
Forget going to the gym to work out! Go make a batch of candy of any type and you will get a work out! Make some divinity or pralines or even whisk up some mousse like Julia Child does and have the most fun work out ever! (Or order this candy out of Tallahassee and then go to the gym I guess :)   )
The YouTube algorithm is a fickle mistress, but she brought me here today
If my wife ever craves a banana split I will tear down hear panties and quickly make one for her to swallow delightfully
I have bananaphobia
Thanks for the extra trivia
Thumbs down for dumb title.
Why is no one talking about how fast and easy he could chop someone’s fingers up?!
This was incredibly pleasant to watch.
Surprisingly educational.
I wish everybody made candy like this. Old ways are the best. Nowadays you got them only putting a little sugar in it and then a bunch of crappy splenda because heaven forbid people practice self control.
I'm allergic to bananas why am I watching this ?
5:26 looks like a hotdog lol
"The seven foot fiberglass 'bannana'..." ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Oh snap. Oh crackle. Oh pop! I need this old school banana candy in my life. And now! Incredible video.
I thought the notification pic was a maggot at first glance! Sorry
i learned a bunch of useless banana info from this
Next time I see some sweets like that, I buy them
There is always money in the banana stand!
There are over 1000 types of bananas.  I don't think the world will be without bananas.  Cavandish will probably go away, but not all bananas.
literally just ate a banana and youtube recommends this
Surprisingly interesting to watch !
How do you keep ants from crawling all over the place?
RING RING     BANANA PLAGUE!
THIS place would be the only reason to visit Florida.  (Love your voice ❤)
Does it taste like banana? Should i make them myself?
Banana the most disgusting flavor ever to be imitated.   I love cherry flavored candy which tastes nothing like an actual cherry.
Those are some pretty cool bananas..     AHHHHHHHHHHAHAHH
so harry styles was right 6:50
how am i from tallahassee and haven't heard of this place!?  have to go when i go back for a visit
685 BANANA HATERS
I’d love own a business like this that has an old historic way of doing things. Amazing and a gem.
Now I want a banana.
Here on my country there are a lot of types of bananas
9:32 RIP to the kid on the left XD
What's the name of the tune playing at the beginning of the video?
I cannot believe I just learned so much info from a candy shop.
PEEL
Where are you located
Thanks for these banana facts my dude
Won't lie, I thought the banana candy in the thumbnail had a maggot in it
I say banana 100,000 times in one video
This made me want to hug a banana
Bananas are crap. Discuss
I don’t know how or why this showed up in my recommendations but I’m absolutely fascinated 👀 I wonder if there’s something similar going on with grape flavoring, because I’ve always thought that grape candy doesn’t taste anything like actual grapes. Incidentally, banana and grape are always my two favorite flavors and I would *loooove* to try this “realistic” banana candy!
:^) oh yes one dude who also knows about the Bananaz
Alright, I've never had these and I'm allergic to bananas and far from the US but youtube recommended me a video about making banana candy and well, I stayed and watched anyway.
I'm confused is this for animals? cuz I like the candy
i love you banana man
There’s always money in the banana stand
I’ve always wondered about that!
why is this narrator so charismatic it's bizarre
That picture of a banana on your candy looks like a worm. From the video picture I thought it was a worm  and got click baited into this video. So what is the source of your banana flavoring? All fake?  I am fine with those threads, any that stick to the banana are fine to eat for me. So I'll keep peeling them by breaking the stem, much easier/no need for a knife. I also eat apples fully, core included , but not stem or seeds that I work out. And I'll eat the peels of organic oranges too, I find it helps with appetite and seems to make me feel better if I am not eating a balanced diet.  I scrape out and eat as much white rind of a watermelon as I can too. So "wrong" is a relative concept. Sure, you waste food your way, I''ll continue eating it more fully my way.  As far as the 3 split, I knew of that. I find it's easier to gently squeeze on the sides in the right spots (like multiple different spots) rather than pushing in from the end. If you look at the inside edge of the three way split you can see little black balls that I bet are immature seeds as a throwback from when it reproduced via seeds.
the fact that you do this by hand and don't atleast have rollers to roll that giant thing out.  REALLY annoys me
This is extraordinarily good content thank you very much!
glad i know how to peel that nana now
I like how you tell us facts while ur making it
Ok YouTube, I'll watch the banana video.
My mother always peeled from the flower and so I started too. I always wondered why lol.
this is so wholesome
This is amazing.
Woo
You can breed bananas??
can i order candy from you guys
Dont you make retro candy not vintage candy?
For some reason I thought that the “banana” design was a worm.
Bananas are grown in many different countries so I don't think they're going anywhere.
I desperately want to taste some hard candy when it's still goopy,  but I also want to be able to taste things for the rest of my life. :(
Saw the thumbnail, looked like a grub in the candy...
What? What is this channel. I don't even know what a banana split is. Why is it so wholesome and more importantly, why did I enjoy this
take a shot ever time he says banana or bananas and you'll get liver failure
The candy man can cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good.
Best product advertisement ever. This was awesome!
I like your vedios - but the upbeat folk version of "blowing in the wind" was a distraction, unrelated and even inappropriate.  Perhaps something that's just instrumental.  I'd enjoy it more (personally) if song lyrics weren't competing with your talk.
How did i end up here
Bananas are cheap af
You make candy... I forge midevil weapons... same thing.
The video has 666 dislikes.
I will never look at my banana the same way again
this video was dope allthough i was no where close looking to watch a candy vid haha
Umm does that unicorn dropping come warm because, yes
Damn that man pulling that candy is a beast, he must have biceps like superman
Tastetester? Where do I send my application?
Thanks YouTube.
Thank you YouTube suggestions....I now need to travel to Florida just to visit a soda fountain.  No sarcasm, I'm thrilled.
Many years ago i used to enjoy eating  Banana ice lollies but sadly for some reason they are no longer made here in England.
HI. I like the Nerds sour flavors, too. It's so powerful.
Your videos are amazing, your a person of my own heart who loves to learn. Oh and I just order the banana and forbidden fruit, so excited!
I've been peeling bananas correctly, I just never knew why you should peel it that way. Also is the banana on the inside on purpose or just a coincidence lol.
thanks for the banana lecture ! I enjoyed this, i play this game and in this game me and my wife and friends have made a guild / clan named "Golden banana peel squad"  - we are the best in the game ofcourse !
How interesting!
The next time I travel home to Jackson county, I’m definitely stopping by!
loooool 9:30
i would love to eat the banana that was prevalent before they were taken out the banana that the artificial flavors based off of because i love that scent and flavor
"I've always thought the yellow wrap is what gave our candy it's great ap-peel" 😂
Me, allergic to bananas.  “We may not have bananas in the future.”  Me: good.
Banana Candy that tastes like banana? I need it x.x
This guy knows so much about bananas
This to me would be a labor of love.
Pretty
I love it
the guy narrating it is so sweet he gives a bob ross vibe
The *G r o S s  M i C h e A L*
I personally enjoy artificial banana flavour
after watching this i feel like I'm gonna eat more bananas now
not sure how i ended up here, but this was informative as heck!
Very interesting...thanks for sharing! And the rock looked awesome!
Weve ben doing it so wrong
I love the history during the videos
I never heard of these and yes i hate artificial banana flavor so much if it taste like banana bread u know its real banana flavor thats what i like .
OMG with your "A-Peel" pun!
😮
I hate banana candies but DAMN the craftsmanship of this thing esp when the banana image in the center was shown!
I love tokyo banana cake and i would love to try your banana candy cos all of these other banana candy taste funky... :/
Where do you find the coupon codes?
This video made me want a banana
Yum BPA laden candy from a boiling plastic spoon used to stirr the color in.🤢🤮
I didn;t know this about the banana flavoring, but i shouldnt be surprised since its the same deal as grapes. Modern grapes don't taste a thing like purple grape flavored candy, which are based off an older grape that used to be super common in stores. It's the old Concord grape
If I'm ever in Florida, I'll be sure to check out the place.
Don't know how I got here, but I watched every minute of it.
I am a big fan of your voice and knowledge of biological symmetry c:
I am allergic to bananas :(
I don’t know how the hell I got here but I’m glad I stayed :)
Still a better love story than twilight
Every time I see people making candy, i always wish i could try it just as it is cooling off from that hot gooey phase.....just seems like hot  gooey (but not boiling! im not stupid lol) would be amazing!
This guy is the Bob Ross of candy. I really enjoyed this video :D
Nowadays I am wondering more and more on Youtube: How did I end up here?
This dude is so smart
How do you get the little banana picture on the candy?
BEEEENN
Can you please hire me as flavor taster? 😁😋
I knew I was right about peeling bannannas from the "bottom" I always do it that way, and the stem then works as a sort of handle for it
So wonderful. A dear family friend is the son of the late Irving Conn, one of the composers of 'Yes, We Have No Bananas'.
i love this channel SO MUUCHH
Art comes in many forms.
Who else was blown away that literally no candy stuck to that hook
I can smell this video 😳
Talking about history and Chiquita Brand, do you know what Banana Massacre is?
Why waste time making the worst flavor of candy??
Perfect!  Candy making, a bit of history, stories...  Perfect!
6:55. Those "strands" are called "phloem", and they care the nutrients to the banana while it grows.
are there no machines for candy pulling or it is better to pull by hand
I love how your videos are so informative in various different ways along with showing how to make the candy! :)
Gros Michelle  not Michael
"If you're ever driving by Tallahassee, we're about five minutes away from I-10. Please come and visit."  I dunno what about your voice made that invitation so genuine but I want to go.
I love the effort you put into your videos.
Who ever even thought of peeling banana from stem end? Seriously :-D That's the weirdest idea I heard today.
Pretty sure its pronounced Gro  Meeshel, but still an awesome video
Only thing I didn’t like is that he used a plastic spoon to stir the hot sugar... not good to get plastic hot like that cuz the chemicals can leach out & even affect the flavor :(
It's great "a-PEEL" 😂😂😂
Technically, humans can be considered a monoculture too. (Explains why the Great Influenza Pandemic took out so many people, too.)  Whoa, that was a little depressing for a comment on a very pretty candy.
Amazing pitch, I want candy now
I still don't understand how they make it look like a banana inside. Magic ))
Love the culture and character this channel and this gentleman shows. adds numerous dimensions to my appreciation for candy and classic artisan craft
Loved this video, i really hope that other variations of bananas can get exported and become popular because they are a very delicious fruit, i have had red bananas before, they are actually sweeter than regular bananas so i'm surprised they haven't become popular, i've had 2 variants of red bananas a regular 6-7 inch size and the mini bananas that are about 4 inches.
So youtube recommends a 10 minute video about how to make banana candy while at the same time listening to banana philosophy.  Can't say I'm mad.
This makes me miss Tally
Great music choice, Dylan's music really lives on.
This is a valuable lesson about the danger of monoculture, and why bananna flavoured candy seldom tastes like a fresh bananna. Incidentally, I always peel my banannas from the tip rather than from the stem end and you can indeed put banannas in meat dishes (especially chicken curry).
I want this candy!
Definitely want to stop by!  Love the process
Lofty! Lofty! Lofty!!
Gros Michel Not Gross Michael.
I hate bananas. But this was still fun to watch
Watermelon and grape don’t taste very much like their real fruit 🍉 counterparts either.
I feel like I'm an expert on bananas now
9:20 I KNOW THAT KID
i love banana sweets.... therefore ive liked and subscribed 😃
This is art.
Rockin Robin, nice choice of background music..
Don't remember seeing willy wonka opening a channel
This video was absolutely fascinating and a blast to watch.
Excellent video, interesting and educational voiceover.
*9:08** (boy in the background) "thats as fas as i chomp down on your nips" ?????? WUHT?!?!?!!?!? lmfao. also, amazing video! love stuff like this! definitely gunna check out your site!*
2:10 I want a banana sized candy bar from the white fold, wrapped in beeswax paper as the peel. Disgusting to suck on a lolly for days, but worth it. I love chocolate bananas, with that strange strong scented jelly inside... So unrealistic, yet so intense 😝
I live near a banana plantation but I only eat  banana sometimes...     6:02
Not gonna watch it but let me guess is it because the candy flavoring tastes more like a Cavendish banana that went extinct a long while ago?
You know, you should tell stories the way that Garrison Keilor did. Just tell stories about history and all sorts of facts and upload them.
Len kagamine
9:29 "letting us know if they liked it or not. They liked it."  *kid drops candy* haha
I got some rhubarb and custard boiled sweets in London. Yummy.
*_Take a shot every time he says sugar and banana and candy_*
Recommendations at it again...
4th largest cultivated crop in the world? Um, that would be potatoes.
I hate most all artificial flavors and I love that yall use natural ones! How great would it be if all candy had real fruit flavors?! Yum!
Get your dab ready,im heating it up bro.
9:32
Tom Scott is one of my favourite channels - why would YouTube recommend candy to me? - (10 minutes later:) Tom Scott needs to see this! Brilliant!
Thank you, another neat video. I've always liked the taste of Chiquita bananas over the others I don't like what they're producing nowadays so I don't eat many bananas. But what do you expect with the GMO of monsanto's.
I kind of spaced out at 8:30 but I heard something about bananas and culture. Listen to Louis Prima "Please no squeeza da banana." Because of you squeeza the banana, the banana she go flat!
That was so damn cool. :D  Loved the actual art of the candy making *and* the history and banana trivia. :D
New drinking game, take a shot everytime he says banana
I like the banana candy flavor so much better than an actual banana  Really, I hate bananas
I know the old fashioned banana song.... My grandmother taught it to me whenI was a child.
surely they make an automatic guillotine to chop those rods up..
"Gros Michel" is actually pronounced "GROW MICHELLE" :P I know doesnt look like it right?
i love how simultaneously woke about monocultures and sweet this video is at the same time
I want a banana now
Very cool what you do!
Who would have thought an anvil would be used in candy making (while cutting)?
This was one of the stranger recommendations but I really enjoyed it! I'm Ashkenazi and I recently found out I'm also a descendant of the plantagenets Henry I etc as my husband is also, I was looking for recipes for British cooking LOL this was hysterical I loved it I will definitely be ordering some of the candy!🤣💖
The yellow wrap gives the candy it's appeal...  I see what you did there.
Here’s a fun idea      *take a shot every time he says candy/candy’s*
"We might not have bananas in the future!" *tyler joseph and josh dun clapping*
pleasing candy making, educating facts, good quality video and audio, clear calm voice, I live in Mexico so I probably will never eat your candy, but I really enjoy watching your videos, thanks!!!
I'm allergic to bananas 😢
GREAT A PEEL AHAHAHAHAHYAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *snort*
I need this in my life.
I was hoping he would be british so I could hear BAWWNAWWWNAWWW
for the same reason blue raspberry tastes nothing like raspberry....
What a cute video 😊
5:01 Doesn't that count plantains all all sorts of cultivars?
Interesting, so this type of hard candy is made in the same way you would make polymer clay canes. Cool.
Nut
it's 2019 and we still have bananas ! Thank God!!
9:30 the kid actually managed to drop his banana.
LOVE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS THE CANDY MAKING (I LOVE BANANAS) GOING TO ORDER SOME WHERE YOU SAID IT WAS "TRUE" BANANA TASTING
IF YOU SAY BANANA WITH ANY OTHER VOWELS IT BECOMES STRANGELY FUNNY LOOK  Benene Binini Bonono Bununu  Well I might as well do y too  Bynyny   YOUR WELCOME
This was a rad video. I love old fashioned soda shoppes, keep up the good work! :)
It was actually called the *"GROS MICHEL"* not "Gross Michael".....  It's pronounced *"GRO MEE-SHELL"*  And it's *"Caven-DISH"* ...not "Caven-DOSH"
You know if everyone peels a banana the same way, it's you who is doing it the wrong way. As it is not the accepted means of use. Get with it.
very educational. thank you
Monoculture is bad, mkay.   And is a problem with pretty much all crops these days.
K N O W L E D G E
Do you guys deliver to england? I SOOOO badly want some of Your sweets
Banana is my favorite flavor....not many places make it
I gotta ask but what song where you singing wile using the hook?
interesting, I just ate a banana and this is shown to me....hmmmm
OMG I've been peeling banana wrongly in my entire life
The guy in the background 2:40 is just staring at the camera
2:46 thatguy just looking in the back haha
I love everything about bananas except a banana by itself. I'll eat anything banana flavored, bananas with peanut butter, banana in ice cream. Buuuut alone, I don't like the after taste.
2:13 the dude on the left is just admiring the making the candy.
The banana flavor syrup, which is like the sticky mess left from rotten banananas is super strong, a cup makes ten gallons of vanilla pudding into banana pudding. I had to add my 2 cents
I know the story of the banana you don't need to tell me it again
damn he bout shatter the glass when he throwed the sisers  i know i cant spell but i try
If I had a penny for every time you said “banana” I would be a billionaire.
Is that not called rock because it is in england
Sorry bro, i aint eating a banana bananus end first.
I last saw these 50 years ago.....
Enjoyed the video and the story
the gros michel thing is an urban legend. also it's pronounced like 'me-shell' not 'michael'
I think it’s pretty neat that things used from over 100 years ago are still used to make candy
*_5:54_**_  Unicorn Droppings!!_*
now i crave sugar
Wonderful and informative. Thanks.
even the employees stop to watch Greg work his magic! mesmerizing
No idea how I got here .... but after seeing this whole video, I'm still asking myself "Why not just use a real banana?"   No candy will come even close to real bananas.
I the delving into history. Kind of skipped the whole thing about the US warring with Panama for bananas (well.. trade but DEFINITELY for bananas).  It's a bit less lighthearted for a candy video but if you're interested in the history it seems like an interesting part about the US's banana story to leave out.  Overall though, great candy video. I don't even like sweets that much but I've been really sucked into these hard candy videos lately.
If I ever head to Florida, y'all are on my stop list! Loved this!
i like how the kid at the end drops the candy.
i love candy
yeah it was a banana fungus that wiped out the original banana flavor...
i live no where near Florida; but can i come work for you lol.
i can now die happy knowing why banana candy taste weird
So I dont like banana at all, but for some reason I just spent 10 minutes watching banana related items being made and learning the history of bananas....
Plastic spoon!  Gross.
The voice is relaxing   Also this video made me go eat a banana
9:31 slip  lol
Monocultures suck amirite. There probably won’t be chocolate in a couple of decades because theobroma cacao (*the* chocolate plant) is threatened by an incurable pathogen.
Looks like pickled peppers
my arms would be on fire working on that hook.
There is something just "good" about old-fashioned candy...its a feeling you don't get when you buy a bag of commercial industrial candy from the super market.  One of my most favorite things to do as a kdi was buy licorice pipes (which were put in a brown lunch bag by the cashier)...still one of my favorite candies...but increasingly hard to find the real deal.
Im loveing your guys content. Plz keep including history and info about the stuff your making. Absolutley facinating to watch and listen!
Amazing candy making. Nice video and commentary. Thanks! Will buy some to try, never had a banana favoured candy before.
Looks delicious. 😋 🍌  Where can I buy this banana candy?
Just a quick note on peeling, the flower end pinches apart- all you need to doissqueeze it between thumband forefinger <with perhaps a bit ef rolling motion> and it will split approximately in half, with that little black thready chunk in the larger of the halves <usually>- no need to slice off the end with a knife.
Please don't add food coloring
Omg, I could listen to you tell stories all day! Subbed and also, candy looks delicious
now this ill buy
People use the word “decimate” incorrectly. To decimate is to destroy 1/10 of something, not to completely destroy it. So you cannot “completely decimate” something.
Rocking robin 🎵
But did the book teach you self defence against a 🍌?
*my ex completely decimated the banana industry*
:O nannnnnnnners
so i clicked a video about banana candys,but i didnt expect to learn so much about bananas and why the heck does youtube recommend this video to me?
Isoamyl acetate is the normal flavoring used. It is just cheap to only use this. While the 'older' Gros Michel has a higher concentration of isoamyl acetate than the modern Cavendish, it isnt purely like that and tastes significantly different than banana candy. They simply do it as a cost saving measure, nothing more
You are a wonderful narrator. Thank you
I've never been a fan of banana-flavored snack, but greatly bananas themselves. I've always wondered why they don't taste the same and now, while still not quite liking it, I have a greater appreciation for the artificial flavoring. I'd also love to visit sometime; I only live about six hours away.
Hmmmm, banoffee candy?  idk if I spelled it right
Man, I don’t know how many years it’s been since I’ve eaten a banana
Real reason, original banana that was used is gone, that type of banana was wiped out, the banana of today is gmo
How did I find this video
I really want a banana now
5:15 no ‘split’!        I’ll go now.
Bananas.
This video is not* some low-hanging fruit*, behind its peel* the video packed with brain food*. 10/10 this was a bunch* of fun to watch.  That first banana joke wasn't a reach* was it?
look up the banana republics, it will really show you the history of America
Okay I actually laughed when the kid popped off with "I know how fast. Its as fast as I chomp down on m&ms"
No idea why this was recommended to me but now I wanna eat candies. i have none here and it's 4AM. What a cruel world. Also this candy store is on the other side of the world as well. It's a tough life.
A good idea is to do gluten free things for like cake in the dessert
Nooo poor boy in the end
i just got my package today. this is my new favorite candy. definitely worth the wait and money.
he said banana like three million times
The bana is not a herb, get your facts rights. A banana is a fruit, more precisely a berry. I don't know why people think banana is a herb, it's a fruit, not a herb.
super interesting stuff! keep it up my good fellow <3
You explained it perfectly! When bananas were first introduced in England people rushed to try them and ate them with the skin on because no one had eaten one before they didn't know how!
I guess that's why I prefer artificial banana.
Lmfao Bob Dylan
Drink game take a drink every time he says banana
9:31 Im dying... xDDDD
that  moment when hes casually  talking about bananas and cutting a thousand pieces of candy a minute
your natural flavors are made in a lab btw. the old banana flavor is just an isolated compound that's an ester
Well thats 10 minutes of my life ill never get back.
YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON ASIDE FROM MY LATE GRANDFATHER I HAVE EVER HEARD REFERENCE "YES WE HAVE NO BANNAS" , EVER!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE MEMORY!! (he used to sing it frequently, but I didn't think it was really a song, other than one he made up bc I had never heard it uttered anywhere else) thank you again!
how and why did I end up watching this?
He has banana 65 times
Not exactly sure why this video was in my suggestion box, but I happen to love candy and I am now going to spend the next few hours on this channel.
youtube needs more content like this. its just so fucking wholesome.
I've never even had a banana split
NO MORE BANANAS!?
Can I work for you guys in the future?
Banana candy sucks.
This reminds me of PBS because of the education but also it makes me think of Bob Ross I am sick and low on O2 so ignore me if u like but yeah I like this video and all ur candy vids they make me happy
Ur so amazing and very talented
wheat aint healthy.
Honestly so glad this was reccomended now I’m binge watching the whole channel! Keep up the great work man
This is so cooooool :D
Bananas with Maple almond butter, yum. Banana candy, YUM! 🍌🍬🍌
I just pinched the end of the banana instead of cutting it.
me and my dad never peeled bananas from the stem
SEVEN F O O T FIVE FIBERGLASS  B. A. N. A. N. A.
This dude is the tightest fool, a true badass King of sweets. Salute
This is awesome!!  And I love all the history of the bananas!!!  Yumm
@9:30 hahaahhaha dropped!!
Bananas are also considered berries
9:30 that kids candy fell out of his hand
dude I love how fast you chop the candy banana rods
i remember how america made Banana Republics in latin america and brutalized and enslaved workers in those countries
this is BEYNNNNSSSS fav candy
i still don’t get the image part :(
I don't know why I clicked this, but I am glad I did. This was very interesting and educational! Also, you have a fantastic storyteller voice. I could listen to you talk all day!
Were you singing while pulling the white part?
What is that song at 9:00
Banana's are the devil
Banana.
The potato of all fruits gets more praise than in deserves. Every yellow piece of candy that I put in my mouth should be lemon, and when it isn't, it immediately ruins my mood.
Can the candy be shipped?
This guy sounds and looks like the most sweet hearted person, just wanna give him a big hug
I want to eat your candy when it's still gooey
I have never tasted a banana split D:  Looks tasty tho
haha, tumblr already taught me about this today before you
I learn, get entertained.. Gosh.. I love these videos.~ And, you guys make candy and taffy, AND Ice Cream!!? Ahh I want to visit you more!!!
The moment you know that you subscribe although you´re only 1 minute in the video...
Look so satisfying
Yum
I’ve just learned so many things about bananas...
Usually wrapped in rice paper right?
iv never eaten a banana split :V
Umm.. what the hell youtube
My cat loves those stingy things on bananas 🍌
i like your style!
isnt that too sharp? the edge of broken candies
Pulling the candy over and around the hook is mesmerizingly cool, even though I'm not a fan of sweets. Craftsmanship is always nice to watch!
lol "we did have a problem with this batch, our taste tester was out so we had to ask for volunteers."  I don't think the customers thought that was a problem at all
5:31 ITS GREAT APPEAL. A PEAL.... AAAAA PEEEEEAAAAAAAALLLLLLL
Great video! Thanks for the tip on peeling a banana!!
I had no idea bananas were so important
Great! Looks so good. Would love to have some sugar free ones.
Ba- nanana Ba-banananananana let's power up! Banana is truly an icon at this point uwu
Do you mean a Cavendish banana?
how did i end upp here?
Well done! Thank You.
Great video, very interesting!
We're the expert at Bananas since we invented them.
My favorite candy place.
9:31 well
Is this anywhere else in Florida?
I wanna go there one day.
I love how you teach us about candy and the making of it and how you also teach us about life and things we don't think about. And your funny. IN ALL YOUR VIDEOS ARE AMAZING
Well it seems you had a recommendation storm a year ago. You may be due for another because I have no clue what I watched that made youtube think I wanted to see this. But I watched the whole thing.
9:30 lol very satisfying video, can i have a candy too?
the reason modern artificial banana flavor doesn't taste like bananas is because the flavor was originally made to taste like a gros michel cultivar, whereas nowadays we all eat cavendish bananas which taste different
Who is doing that cover of the Fastball song? Or did Fastball do the cover... ?
Excellent publicity. Very charming! I've never tried this candy, but I would happily try if the opportunity presents itself!
you really made me want some naners
Music is too loud
8:02 - This is clearly your first time doing this! ^_^ How satisfying to watch!
grow mee-shell and caven-dish, not gross michael or caven-dosh
Now I wanna eat a banana
Very interesting! As a graphic artist I often get jobs for candy like this with images or letters in it. I have NO idea how they do it. I wonder if it's something like this? (usually always peppermint or strawberry). I had some funny little bananas in Bali a few years ago that tasted almost exactly like those banana lollies.
Love bananas, but hate banana-candy. I would love to try the real deal :)
SO impressed how fast you cut that candy
the guy watching him at 2:22 ... mesmerized
Can i buy you candy online?
Love these videos!
I just moved to Tallahassee! Would love to visit sometime.
He really likes bananas ....hmmmm..he must secretly be a Yiga clan member
Weird and cool.
I have NO idea why this came up in my notifications to watch??? Well, first of all, I loved this whole thing, the process, the filming, the skill, the whole thing. Second, you sir are one talented individual, you make it look so easy. I know that I would end up with a burnt, disgusting blob of inedible something and 3rd degree burns up to my elbows. Hats off to you. Third, I can't believe the level of trivia you seem to poses on the subject. What's that all about? Brilliant! Lastly, I now REALLY want to try some of you delicious looking candy. Sadly, I live in the UK so I can't pop along & just buy some; I'm so disappointed.  So ya, this was just Fantastic !
Everyone who's into bananas needs to start growing and refining them into different types of bananas so that our sweet yellow buddies stop being at risk
No idea why but I do enjoy watching this
I saw how it was done. But I still have no clue how the hell you pulled that off. GG my good sir.
i mean i LOVE bananas, but this guy loves bananas even more :D makes me happy to be honest
The obnoxious background music is not not helpful.
Had to pause and eat a banana. :)
I've never liked hard candy. I've never even *seen* a soda shop like this.  And yet for some reason, this video made me nostalgic for a time I've never seen, happy for a life I've never lived, and sad for the loss of things I've never had.  This is a crazy world we live in. Who knows what the next generation will have. Who knows what they'll lose. It's all part of being human.
This is where I realized that camilla cabello song was a sample!
you can avoid the satan anus bit to
i dont know how i got here but i've never appreciated bananas more
9:30 kids candy falls out of his hand
its so good
Who did the Fastball cover at the end?
Is this video about banana's?
this is the best video ever
I had no reason to watch this video but I stayed because you are quite a good story teller. keep it up with the videos.
Your really fast with that chopper thing fair play lol
This guy is going bananas over bananas
GIVE ME THE BANANA!
Watching that last boy drop his piece of candy, then it moves to the next clip...I'll never know if he got candy or not.
Is it just me or that "banana" looks more like a worm?
I learned a lot more than just candy making in this video! Thanks
Oh god Banana + Beef is the only food I litteraly can not eat. Its such a wierd flavour
I dont even eat candy.  But this is a lovely video
I strongly disagree about the banana peeling technique, but I did love the video.
wait, how did he get that banana picture in there ?!
i used to peel bananas right way as you say but there was some cases when peoples get poisoned from tip of bananas because there was poison from spider/scorpions/snakes whatever :D
It's 3:46 AM and I have no clue how I got here, but this video is surprisingly soothing!
Odd soundtrack choice for a video I have no idea why it was recommended.
Here in the homeground of bananas, we can easily obtain a lot of different types of banana without much difficulty (though the Cavendish is, of course, the most common still). It's actually rather fun to eat different types of banana and taste their different flavours, though apparently I have a condition to do with certain bananas so I can't eat too many of them. :(  We love deep-frying bananas coated in a batter, called many names (goreng pisang here). If you get your hands on much sweeter varieties of banana, this is actually a surprisingly simple yet delicious way to make a cooked banana.
he doesn't know what he started with the whole "eating bananas wrong thing" lol
Genius candy maker, seems humble and is a artist, plus historian!!! Where are his million views???
I feel like wearing a banana right about now
this is so wholesome
i clicked for the candy and i left with every fact about bananas known to man
Hey Gross Michael, grow me a shell!
Awesome video. I'm experimenting myself with candy making at the moment. And just learned a lot by watching this. Thank you very much.
bananas or plantains are the 10th largest cultivated crop in the world my friend not AT ALL the fourth.
Youtube has been giving me some good recommendations lately.  I feel way calmer after watching this, thanks! : )
What if all advertisements were like this?
Now i wanna eat a banana...
just came from a video critiquing the fact of how over the years advertisements have shifted from just saying what the product is to being entertaining and relatable. the very next video I watch is basically one long advertisement saying to buy their candy while showing you how to make it and the history of bananas. huh very effective brainwashing.
this is amazing
The symmetry you speak of is not based on even or odd. It is based on the Fibonacci numbers like 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,etc.
its like youtube knows im high
I'm fine with the hairs on bananas.
i was thinking for the entire time that youtube was down that this chould have been the last youtube video i watched..  at least it whould have ended on a high note...
So is this about bananas ?
I want a banana now
Love this place! (also please bring back the Pomegranate Peach flavor please)
It's not "Gross Michael", it's "Gros Michel", the weird spelling should be a giant clue that the name isn't English. It's pronounced "grO MEE-shell" In English the name is "Fat Michael". It's really jarring to hear someone call it the wrong name, especially someone who purports the know something about bananas.  It's not "cavendash" either. It's Cavendish, and that one is English so you've got no excuse for butchering that one.
i still don't understand how the banana shape came out.
9:31 mad world
legend has it he is still hookin that candy
no idea why this was recommended but i want some
Subscribed, liked and whitelisted on my adblocker :D!
Fascinating. I've always wondered this about fruit flavored candies. Banana, grape, cherry; I can taste a cherry candy and say "oh, that's cherry!" But I've never tasted an actual cherry that was anything like the candy taste. Same with grape.  Well I know the story behind Banana now; I wonder if the others are similar.
This is cool.  Banana Runtz are good.
Hello? i am from Russia? It is very sweet video, i want to do same candy. Can you send me recipe basics and using additives/ My english so bad but with translater i can understand more. Thanks
Because it’s America... in the UK artificial flavourings are basically non existent in things marketed to children...
godbless you sir
Enough banana facts to last you a life time.
"I've tried a Gross Michael" My girl and I almost died laughing but kudos on being progressive.  BTW its Gros Michel (think Grow me'shell) not Gross Michael. Its french, just google how to pronounce, there are many sites that show an example. Also Cavendish is pronounced kav'en'dish. Love your vids.
The "gross micheal"  is french and should be pronounced 'grow michelle'
Ray comfort would flounder if he saw this video.
Bananas will not die out. They might become slightly more expensive, but they will never die out. Thank CRISPR and Monsanto for that
It was recommended for me as well for some reason, I subscribed and will order banana candy.
now i want some banana candy!
I went to Lofty pursuits with my cousin a few years back when she was at Uni. It's a great little shop!
The Chiquita Banana Co.? Was that around the time they were involved in that massacre in the southern American country? Still, that aside, interesting video. I've seen hard candy being made before, it's still something interesting to see.
Deeelightful! :D
9:06 That melody, Lyric, Rhythm and notatation sound AWFULLY familiar to something on the radio.
I will buy, just cause of sheer nostalgia.
A true Americana story here. Bless you guys!
I've always peeled bananas that way! the trick is to pop the flower end off with your thumbnail, it usually stays attached to one of the sides of the peel but you just peel it back with it
I really like this video and all the info contained, with one exception. Gros Michel is pronounced "Grow MeShell". It saddened me to hear gross Michael haha
I bookmarked your site, seems like some fun Christmas candy to order
I've always wondered why artificial flavored banana tastes nothing like banana. Thanks for the video and the history lesson.
wait, people actually peel bananas from the stem? I'm Asian and i never see people do that.
I loved your video
This was an appeeling video.
I'd love to visit your shop but I have a fear of Florida Man. Has he ever visited your establishment?
This is AWESOME!  Such respect for this craft. I love this
I just bought fu%ken 25$ worth. I'm going to enjoy this. And maybe share with my co-workers. Update they where hit with Hurricane Michael
cool. Sometimes youtube's algorithm ..Kinda gets it right? well this is way better them some as% blogging. I know about this little fact, but I want to taste this now!!!
That was mesmerising, and I'm not sure how I ended up here, but I sure am glad I did. You earned a new subscriber!
In a future video, could you explain why they are called "soda jerks" ?
But candy TASTES SO GOOD
Great video!  Thank you! Banana candy has always been one of my favorites!
banana Laughy Taffy and Runts are my favorite
Made me eat a banana
Artificial banana flavorings do taste like banana, but it is only one part of the banana flavor.  Current export bananas have less of this flavor than older bananas did, but artificially flavored banana items do not taste exactly like old bananas either.  You can get the gros michel cultivar if you want to actually taste them or even grow yourself in some climates.
I love how you say that we don't look over our own history enough but then you mention the Chiquita company without mentioning the exploitation and murders that occurred in Latin American countries cause by Americans protecting corporate interests.
Darned industrial revolution.  Because of it, countless of generations of old fuddy duddies get to obsess over ornate victorian rock candies.
He is so pure....
gross michael? its pronounced grow michelle
Youtube Recommends video... I end up buying $20 worth of candy... We see you google...
Boy this guy really likes bananas
I like banana stories because they are so appealing 8D
9:31 he dropped the candy 😂
I’ve been peeling bananas wrong all my life........ wtf
You seem like you would be the best dad ever.
You're truly doing God's work.
This drove me bananas
XD just watching this, i kinda want a whole stick XD
I thought that was a maggot
At first i thought that it was some parasite found in a food looking at the thumbnail
The cut right after that kid dropped his candy at the end, comedic success.
9:31 how this could happened to meeee
9:31 boy drops his piece of candy and you can hear it and see it.
mind blown.... peel banna in reversie
Thanks for the banana lesson.
I went here on a field trip a while back I think. They gave us samples of the taffy. It’s nice to see more on how it’s made.
So beautiful!
I have no idea how I stumbled on this video but I really enjoyed this!  I don't really have an interest in making candy or anything.  But this was so interesting I was sucked in before I knew what hit me!  LOL!  I'm a new subscriber now.
Your channel makes me so so happy
I know this is pointless... its not pronounced Gross Michael... Its pronounced like "Grow Michelle". Gross Michael sounds really funny though
So the current bananas are better tasting than the Gros Michel?
9:32 rip candy boi
Screw this. Too much work for some candy
"the yellow wrap is what gives out banana candy its great aPPEAL"  I see what you did there
VERY FAST banana rod cutting at incredible hihg speed
9:25 lol fail poor kid
This is cool! Loved the facts
I've never learned about bananas as much as I did from this video
Do you deliver to sweden?
Drink every time he says banana
I wonder where I can get a Michael Gross (Family Ties), I mean Gross Michael, banana.
I now know how to properly peel a banana.  Glad I clicked on this video :) this guy knows his bananas...  b. a. n. a. n. a. s. ;)
I've always wanted to make a banana flavored coffee creamer. So I tried but wasn't successful
I learn a lot about bananas, thank you sir :)
The banana flavoring being based off an extinct type of banana is a myth. The artificial flavoring is a byproduct of Isoamyl acetate, merely it tastes similar to the flavor of the Gros Michel.
I love this
Banana's are disgusting
those last candies could be called banana mouth shredders
Very neat!
I just love this part 9:31
Oh I'm subbing to this right now!
I thought I new everything there is to know about bananas, I was wrong about that. I’m hooked on your channel, love your work 😀
I BET YOU LIKE BANANAS
Wow! I’m learning so much!!
Love your enthusiasm/knowledge!
Those look so good. I love banana candy. I'd love to try those.
Bananas are berries not candy.
Banana history and future always fascinated me for some reason. I'm glad you touched upon some of it here. I've gotten to try new genus of bananas they are further breeding and considering for future use should the current ones get desomated
This man really likes bananas
Has anybody tried these?! I'm guessing they don't taste like banana runts then huh?! I'm almost wanting to buy them to see how a real banana candy is supposed to taste like lol?!
Oh you're so punny!
The kid's candy fell 😂 9:32
What an informative episode! I don't​ normally buy candy and I'm on the other side of the world to come and visit how you make this, however, this video was very informative and I enjoyed watching you make the candy whilst placing some history in your video about bananas! Awesome!
Actual quality content  😆
Why am I watching this at 12:30PM on a school night?   My life is a mess
9:30 :(
lofty pursuits is so good! I remember going to a birthday party here :))
this is amazing. I don't even know how I got here but I'm glad I did.
That's BANANAS!
Ben gotta see this
So folding it that way creates a banana shape in the candy???
.....and I improved on my banana bread, just two days ago, by tossing my fruit into the microwave for 5 minutes....(sliced peeled pieces)...super idea...REALLY added sweetness !!!!
i really admire your historicism <3
My grandma always peeled my banana that way
The uploader of this youtube channel is just 😬😠😡   HOW COULD YOU ?? 😢😭   I am a sweet addicted guy. And your channel just gives me a million reasons to cuss you again and again... after seeing all those mouth watering sweet Candies.. 😍  I swear...I am.dying here... Sometimes I wish If I had money to travel.. I will fly..break into your candy store and eat all those marvellous candies..😍😋😋..  I really wanna eat these 😭😭😭
ive actually never had a banana split before
I've heard before that you're supposed to peel bananas the other way, but whenever I've tried it never works any better.  All the little strands still stay with the banana.
WHAT SONG IS PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND AT THE END? Sounds like 'Out of My Mind' by Fastball but old timey
That was very interesting! like watching an old "How is it made?" film but with commentary! How nice!
Thanks from Corpus Christ, Tx.  Peace, love and joy to you, my friend.
I live in Kissimmee, so I might come by sometime
Thank you for these opportunities to learn about candy crafting.
I like how he drop The candy  when handing it to The last kid lmfao
Darn Larry always sick     Dont worry Larry I am always sick to I am jest kidding :3
Very cool
Why does the kid dropping the candy at 9:31 make me laugh? The timing? The unintentional sound on the video when the candy hits the counter? The fact that he's awkwardly holding his palm sort of vertical while being handed something? I secretly enjoy when kids get hurt and/or disappointed? All of the above?
Wish i could come work for you
Thank you so much for sharing this process and lovely information about bananas with me.
No idea how this came to exist in my feed, but so happy it did! I've been obsessed with banana everything lately. This video was impossible to look away from, and very educational and your voice is very calming. Like Bob The Painter. (RIP Bob Ross)
9:31 haha SYKE!
I love bananas but live in San Francisco Bay area, just ordered this plus variety pack. Yum. I can't wait. I remember eating banana ice cream growing up. Yummm
30$ shipping to Europe? :( Only PayPal? Sorry, I would love to buy but not when you only offer PayPal and shipping is 30$ :3
You are a cook, artist, intellectual, all wrapped into one. It's like watching "How it's made" but with history. thank you so much.
5:33  apPEEL
do you make aniseed humbugs?
Can someone tell me the song at around 8:30?
The “Gros Michel” is pronounced GRO MEE-SHEL. It’s a French word. I cringed every time he said gross michael. Sounds like a disgusting banana...
That's why banana candy tastes so strange.
What is the song playing in the background pls? At the beginning, 1/3 of the awesome video plays it...
Gosh that must cause some serious arthritis
I live in Miami Florida, I might really want to go to Tallahassee just for this vintage everything shop.
Go to Sam O Nella academy for some great banana republics but not the clothes a extremely big banana industry that started wars
Now I want a banana
"I always thought the yellow wrap is gives our banana candy its great A *PEEL*"  got a chuckle out of me
Well...... this amused me
I'm not sure why this appeared in my recommended videos either, but this was a neat watch.
Just found this channel and subscribed. Very informative, thank you for making this video.
Lol the kid dropped his candy
I always thought a lot of banana flavored candies have a really weird taste, like rubber almost. I'm also slightly disturbed by the fact that I know what rubber tastes like, but don't remember HOW I learned that.
Lol all the peeps who are like "Idk why YouTube recommended this to me", that was my first thought too. But it turns out that while this may not have been the video I asked for, it WAS the video I needed. I am now subscribed to this channel and putting this place on the itinerary for the trip to Tallahassee I'm planning for next year.
Olá Onde eu posso comprar dessas luvas que você usa no minuto 1:50?
Gros Michel....harsher flavor, my ass--that's what a banana SHOULD taste like. The Cavendish is a pale imitation.
Take a shot for every time he says banana
FSU baby go Noles!
this brings bad memories of my grandparents whom also bought ribboned candy, hard candy of all flavors. awesome! God Bless
Fascinating video. Very very nice. 10/10
Oh how I wish I had this job!!!!!!
monoculturing is a freaking insidious practice and, if you don't believe me, read up on the Irish potato famine. any time you only have one variety of a staple item, you're eventually going to run into trouble when nature catches up and produces the appropriate blight to bring it down. this is why the world needs more heirloom and specialized varieties of the species we already love and depend on. the extinction of the Cavendish won't cause anyone any lasting harm (potatoes have more potassium anyway and there are plenty of other fruits out there -- even if I will miss the hell out of my banana bread), but it's a clear and immediate illustration of what happens when we inbreed a food item so much that one fungal infection can destroy 90% of its representatives on the entire planet.  also, those candies look delicious and I'm feeling seriously inspired to make taffy or something the next day it's under 90 degrees in Ohio
The reason I dont like Bananas is I had a nightmare about me eating bananas but here's the catch  I was eating just the peels ;-;
*The More You Know*
Very interesting. Thank you
thats actually a myth
You must gain some serious muscle by pulling the sugar. I wonder how tough it really is to work with. Your job looks like a lot of fun!
This video is a treat! Thank you for sharing!
..... it looked like a corn dog at first
Being from the islands we’ve been eating patties made of bananas and meat.
I've heard to do the flower end first before but never heard the reason! Fantastic!
Wow, that design technique is incredible!
I'm peeling it right
Ohhhh wowwww that was awesome!! I enjoyed that thoroughly, i need this candy now!!
Oh noooooo 🙀🙊🙉 no the extinction of Banaynays
That’s a workout,he should be buff💪🏼 as a stallion
I love anything banana!! Had to find a good nana candy🍌🍌🍌
Bananecdotes...
9:31 greg drops it *kid dies inside*
Gross Michael?  Gros Michel. Grow. Me. Shell.
*sweets also i dont like bananas
I thought it was a worm
Poor kid (to the left) at the end.  He's waiting for his candy, and it drops from his hand when he finally gets it...😧
Am I the only one that noticed the last kid dropped his candy?
How to me, all fruit flavoured candies tastes exactly the same, and not at all like what they're supposed to...
These videos are really relaxing
erb or herb
fun fact: I used to work at a smoothie place and we would get these HUGE boxes of fresh bananas and I would always fight to take food shipments in on banana day because.. the SMELL when you opened a box FULL of bananas smells exactly like banana candy. so I no longer knock banana candy TOO hard abt the taste:)
In my country there is like 4 or more banana breeds some are green, pink, red and yellow. People make a lot of dishes with them
Bananas killed my family so I do not recommend them
5:54 _Come to our store, you can eat _*_unicorn droppings_*_ !!!!_ LOL
Wow, what interesting banana knowledge!!
I live in Tallahassee... this is creepy
Whoever did the voice over, I love it. I also love all the history and info tidbits.
I love this channel
9:30 the kid dropped the candy
You should check out the Chinese banana ice cream pop.  It's a banana shaped and flavored ice cream surrounded in a yellow edible gelatin, which resembles the peel.
My father (who in this right is Looney) hates bananas he refuses to eat them and gets sick from the smell of them.
Sorry, I don't like anything banana flavored except bananas
Ok wierd.  I was watching a cell phone teardown video, and somehow this video came up as a recommended.  I actually watched this video and found it interesting.    Youtube is wierd . . . . or am I the one that's wierd??
I love the smell off it and the taste... 🍬yummy..banana coke/banana ice cream etc....
9:31 Crushed dreams.
My guy dropping banana facts.
Honestly, I hate banana flavoured anything. I like the fruit but the artificial flavouring makes me feel ill, so idk why I'm watching this
5:30 BOOOO! 😂😂😂
I tried to place an order but it wouldn't let me put in a credit card. I also tried calling to place the order but it never put me through to where I could leave a message. I guess I won't be ordering since there's so many issues with the ordering process. If you would like to sell me some candy please feel free to contact me.
this guy makes me feel better about being a person with a bunch of unrelated interests. this is a great video, it's oozing passion and i love how peaceful and happy this guy is alternating between talking about bananas, history, candy making, and musing about the future. i can't wait to visit and i'm so glad he's sharing these videos
Its not pronounced Gross Michael haha.
Take a shot every time he says banana
What are you basing the claim that the gross Michele aren’t extinct on? They’re  literally impossible to find anywhere...
how old is this candy technique as a whole?
labor intensive
I wonder if he likes bannanas
Try cooking a banana in some oil and eating it. You'll understand why artificial banana flavor tastes the way it does.
Happy to know this video exist
He's so passionate about bananas
I love this channel. Great story telling
Go to Ecuador and you’ll see a bunch of little shops doing this outside
I hope I can go to FL one of these days to visit these guys! Looks like a great place!!  <3
The history of the banana is tied in with imperialism as well ... but, of course, that wouldn't have been appropriate to discuss on a channel like this, yes?   In any case, I do enjoy bananas and banana-flavored treats.
I am going bananas for your banana expertise!
This type of candy is common in the UK, it's called 'rock' and sold at seaside holiday resorts.
9:29 this kid missed
So simply banana candies taste like banana, but type that isn't available worldwide to buy today?
Gros Michel is pronounced: GROW mee-SHELL. But Gross Michael is pretty cool name too. jk gross
We are better experts on bananas we grow them
Just as a heads up, it's pronounced "grow Michelle" not "gross Michael", that's just how it looks from spelling!
Came to watch candy be made and now I'm worried about the future of the banana. Didn't expect that.
9:32 : for the damaged coda plays in the kid's mind
I love the story telling in this one!
9:30 psyche!
You can't talk about bananas in America without talking about the banana wars...
banana, banana, banana. Am I watching a Minions movie or a candy video?
now this is the randomly recommended content i didn't sign up for but will accept
Oh my god! This Video is so strangely comforting!
Fascinating about the banana!
9:30 Anyone catch that? 😂
looks like a giant slab of wax
I am sure they threads wont happen if your banana is actually ripe
You're a badass.
I once left a very ripe banana in a hot car and when I got to it, it tasted very much like banana Laffy Taffy.
this is an amazing, well done video. i hate bananas. but i learned a lot
Bananas are yummy. I make a nail oil that smells like banana split and a more mixed banana flavor. 🍧🍌🍍🍌💖😁
WOW I learnt so much about bananas :o
the MRS here... wow bunches of info i didnt know!!!!!  and the one banana thing i miss the most is banana yogurt (which the good stuff tastes like banana baby food mmmmm..) i wish they made that more..  love your video and the info!!! <3
Huh people peel with the stem? Well i grew up with the other side lol
This is fascinating (and mouthwatering) stuff.
they don't ship to argentina. i'm heartbroken
9:32 r.i.p that kids candy
Fascinating.. Never would have thought this could be an enlightening and interesting video but I was wrong. Glad I watched it. Love your passion. Keep doing what you're doing.. Keeping the best of the past alive and contributing to ensuring bananas don't become a memory.
1:09 i just have the urge to pick up that slice and just  eat i t like a slice of pizza .. head back mouth open lol
Wow you learn something new everyday. Never even heard of gros michel bananas before. However many times I've heard why banana candy didn't taste anything like bananas. Now I did hear something about corruption and the Chiquita banana company once.
im allergic to bananas :(
Yellow food coloring is so bad
Drink a shot every time he says banana
Everytime I watch these videos I order the candy :D
the thing that you should peel bananas from the bottom up is wrong. It's a myth.
"It taught me some cool things about bananas, and how you should deal with them." Wow.
The part where the candy was being cut was so satisfying
damn this dude knows his bananas. Kinda want one now. I wonder if scientists can make bananas grow on plants that arent banana trees.
Dose anyone else want to shake their hand When he cuts it like yoyr citing it to
First time I've seen your vid. Not only was it satisfying and looked tasty, I learned some cool facts. I love candy, little known trivia, and ....... certain plants.
Damn now I want a banana
This is so calming AND educational in different ways! Sadly I live far so away from your shop that I may never try your candy so maybe I'll try making some for my own. For science!
I could listen to you talk all day! Such a great video
Great *apeel*
This is the 9th doctor's favourite video
why can't every history lesson be set to candy-making?  It's much more fun!
Greg, I love your use of a Bakers Bench Scraper, and the speed you wield it at! As a Chef & Baker, I can see how talented you are at this! If I ever get to Talahassee I'll come pay you a visit, not sure I'll get Candy, I try to limit my sugar intake, but Coffe would be nice!
why am I binging this? its addictive
Great presentation of yourself and your product.
Neat
banana banana banana banana banana banananabanababananababanaana
why the hell i'm craving bananas all of a sudden...  great vid tho, some serious skill showed and very informative narration about that fruit. thumbs up.
Anyone else see the piece of candy fall out the kids hand at the end?
I can't believe I watched the whole thing.  It was mesmerizing and the man commentating was so relaxing to listen to. He should do radio.
i don't even like bananas but this video is awsome
he sounds like kevin from the office with slightly more enthusiasm lol
BANANA!
Just got mine in the mail and they are delicious
I love the way the person narrated it, felt soothing. Good to see the workers so relaxed. I'd love to visit someday.
Banana candy and sweet flavoring is my favorite.
You have earned my subscribe
hmmm interesting, i thought people just peel it like that to use the stem as the "handle", but now that i know it makes the strings come off with the husk... i'm sold... that will be my technique from now til the end of time.
It looks very a-peel-ing
god its so crazy that amber+air = white and white+amber=opaque yellow but nowhere inbetween adding air does it seem to become more opaque yellow
This is an amazing video. The information about bananas was very informative. Also I really thought that the banana wouldn't turn out as well as it did. I'm banana's over this video!! Thank you.
weird ive always peeled banans from the flower end, opens easier.
I did wonder when I saw some children start to appear on screen when you started to cut the sweet if you would give them a free sample. I watched to see if anyone said thank you and from what was included it didn't look like it. Let it be known if I was there and you gave me a free piece to sample you would have had my gratitude and thanks.
Im soo blitzed, thank you youtube for guiding my soul here.
seeing him cut that candy is just--ooh  oOOoh
this video says banana so much that i literally skipped halfway through the word banana and the part i skipped to perfectly finished the rest of the word ba-nana
I'm sorry but you look a bit like aguste gusteau from ratatoullie
I never wanted to learn about bananas until I watched this
I wish I lived in America I'd love to come to your shop
If i what in the world your talking about. Bananas are awful.
5:34 "great aPEEL"
can we talk about how fast he chops those rods 0.o  now that is a impressive
this video made me v happy
Just ordered some of these, can't wait lol.
I was NOT expecting to learn the info about bananas, LOVE IT
Is that a cover of Fastball- Out of My Head at the end of the video? Love the vintage sound of it, could someone tell me where to find it? Thanks!
I have never had a banana split
omg i love you
The flavor is because bananas contain isoamyl acetate. all breeds to. But because Cavendish bananas have a more complex flavor, they dont taste as much like pure isoamyl acetate. There isnt really a "reason" they made them taste like Gros Michael bananas. It was just kind of a side effect of the main compound used to create the flavor. History is fun!!
I love this.  8:02 is the most satisfying thing in the world.
Is the song "blowing in the wind" playing in the background?at the end it plays Fastball "out of my head. "
Can you make a pumpkin candy please
I love your videos and I want to have your job
Mom told me to find something educational...so here I am☺️
Ur voice is so calming
You're a regular candy warhol.
a year later and we still got bananas,yesssss
Just received my order for these. Absolutely great.
Another Banana Life Hak Wrap a Piece of Cling Film around the Stem of the Banna Bunch to make it last longer
9:31 that sad moment when you drop your candy
what song is in the beginning??
The more you know.
Yummy looking bananas
Bananas for some reason has something in it that makes you happy, it’s strange I know🍌
For some reason it's entertaining to hear him pronounce banana
Is it me or does anyone want to squish the candy in ur hand
do y'all eat your bananas with or without the tree?
Banana knowledge level *+100*
"We love bananas. " ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Yes, I agree that your candies are very a-peel-ing!
I live in Grand Ridge in Jackson County about 50 miles from Tallahassee I will be stopping.by to see y’all soon!!!
450th dislike jesssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that little mans candy hit the table and I lost it
I wanna be Larry....
_why are bananas so interesting and unique?_
Gocompareee
The bananas look like worms in the candy
This is such an incredible video, watching the candy be made while being inundated with new information.
Your videos are great 👍  very entertaining
What are these sweets called
I like the knowledge that you give us in each video about candy
Hey I have a question what if you try and make the candy bite size like how you row the big thing don't do that just make it bite size what will happen?
Just found your channel.and it's awesome. I like how it's more than just making candy, but you give a history on the candy and what went into making it and the flavors.
What does this have to do with the price of bananas
I... Don't.... Like..... Bananas.....
The way you cut the candy is so satisfying.
Hello! Did you know that you made 41 moves with that candy.. it means 2 exponent. 41 it means that you created more than 2Trillion candy layers over there in less then 2 minutes! :) congrats !
Eating the peach image candies I ordered a few days ago.  😊
I've got
I hate bananas. When ever I eat one something bad happens. I can live with out bananas.
Yummy
Am I a banana expert now???
i dont like banana candy. its just a disgusting flavor       well atleast in belgium.
I want bananas now.
Here's another fact. Bananas are slightly radioactive because of the potassium. Because of this, a unit of measurement for radiation was created called the banana equivalent dose.
I also want to start a plant of candy like this . Please help me how to do so
Very informative. Thank you.
Do your arms get tired after stretching the candy all day
A REALLY want to try a unicorn dropping from your store
Did your banana research lead you to the Colombian banana massacre?
Those are some damn fine cutting skills
dear sir I want join with you I am hand made & machine made candi maker
mmm
This is awesome! Thank you for existing
I love this because one time in 6th grade I was at my friend's house and it was probably 3:00 am in the morning. She for some reason started calling me Banana She still does. I love it.
How much times does he say banana in this video?
You know what would be good? If you shipped the rods of candy instead of the pieces but they cost more
That one kid at 9:31 made me laugh so hard when he dropped it
Now I’m going to start eating bananas before they go extinct
Yay my friends always say I open bananas wrong but they are wrong
I fell like you guys could make huge $$$ selling large logs of candy like peppermint sticks but every flavor candy you make. 1 inch by 10 inch dowels
We could just switch to more natural ones.
You should sell the rods of candy I reckon you would get lots of buys
Public Confection eh hue hue hue
Another great video greg!
Peal a banana peel? What sound does it make?
I wouldn't be super concerned with the future of the banana, we can use tissue culture techniques to grow plants in completely sterile conditions these days and can use genetic engineering to give disease resistance to mono-cultures.  I think papayas are an example of this, several years ago a disease was threatening hawaii's papaya industry, so we made some that were immune. There are also genetically modified cultivars of cassava that are immune to a disease that is currently (or recently) causing crop failure in africa.
We get it everyone. You're not sure why this was suggested to you. No one knows. It's an algorithm. It's guessing.
Does anyone else just love 😍 the candy cut part
hey can i get the address because im going on an road trip soon and i want to see if i can stop by
Candy Anvil!!
wow I actually didn't in know that about bananas!
very serene thanks mate
The perfection is the imperfection .
Plz well unicorn drops online
Pretty poppin
Why is it so hard to make the color white into candy?        Cause actual work gos into it
Why do people dislike this
Try making image candy DROPS
Even the banana syrup not taste like banana
a verry a'pealing' video
Greg, are you the founder of Lofty Pursuits?
Wow, you are pronouncing the banana incorrectly. Its not Gross Michael... Its Gros Michel. Think french African accent.
Some bananas growing on Hawaii taste just like the artificial banana flavor. Seriously...
You're in Florida! I need to GO to that store!
all your vids are top notch. new sub 👍
Not to be an ass, but it's pronouced "Grow Michelle"
Looks like a bacteria on a food
I’d really like to taste these, they look super cool, but... I’m allergic to bananas :(  I wish there was a version with the artificial flavor. I know it doesn’t taste as natural, but I’d still love it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Every video bring a smile to my face, I learn something new and get to watch a master at work! I'm only 15 and live in California so the chance of me visiting the shop are slim. But you can count on me buying some banana and black curtan candies
Who else only watches this because it’s satisfying
I dont know why I'm getting candy making videos, but I like it
2018 the banana still survives.
"Gives it a great a-peel" ...banana pun
I love the children watching you cut the candy through the glass and licking their lips. They look like they can’t wait to eat it.
A banana is a type of berry
When you cut it that was so satisfying
I'm not complaining but I have been watching nothing but anime clips for weeks and this pops up in my recommend. But that looks like some good candy.
Not hating, but that kid in the last frame didn't receive his piece
Its cuuute
If this was a competition to see how many times you could say banana in  10 minutes you won. :) I love me some bananas!
Just got a lesson on bananas while watching the creation of candy
I learned to peel a banana properly on a candy video. Didn't expect that.
You are a busy guy running a toy store, soda fountain, ice cream parlor, wholesale, and YouTube channel.    Good for you
Nice but your pronouncing the banana wrong. It’s pronounced like “grow me-shell” . Not “gross Michael”. Also it’s “cav-in-dish” not “Dosh”.
It's not that banana-flavored candy doesn't taste like bananas, it's that BANANAS DON'T TASTE LIKE BANANAS
I don't even know why I am here, but I loved this video
You've got such a relaxing way of talking. You're like the Bob Ross of Candy Making.
When he cuts the candy, it's so satisfying.
SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT THERE WAS A BANANA APOCALYPSE AND NOBODY TALKED ABOUT IT????
i have never watched your channel ever but it recommended it to me so i subscribed to you. im happy i found this channel.
you are making me hungry!!
We are reaching levels of comfy that frankly are obsncene
This is my personal favorite candy you guys have and my cousin who has autism really likes the "I Love You" candy
I live in upstate NY. Do you guys ship candy?EDIT: commented before watching entire video. I'll  have to order some candy.
These videos are so incredibly soothing to watch. I don't remember how I found this channel, but I'm so glad that I did.
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-nana Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-nana Banana-ah-ah  Potato-na-ah-ah Banana-ah-ah
We very much will have bananas in the future there are millions of types there's just one type that's used more than the rest. Please don't spread misinformation,
please make more sour candy.
Every time he says banana the video gets 1% faster
Great artists
damn... nice commercial :D I'm not even annoyed and stayed till the end
You're amazing
What am i doing here at 5 in the morning. IM NOT EVEN AMERICAN, IM AS FAR AWAY AS SOMEONE CAN GET. IM FROM GERMANY
Gros Michel, it's pronounced "grow me-shell". Gross Michael, LOL. They're supposed to actually be delicious.
im 9yrs old again, i miss the old days when strangers would hand out candy...  and whats happened to puppies? no one ever asks anymore!
Actually bought some of this. Banging. Definitely taste the old school banana flavor
Your a chopping master!
THIS IS THE BOB ROSS OF CANDY
That kid that dropped his candy at the end xd
Is steel better than marble when it comes to cooling candy?
i watched this while eating banana flavored laffy taffy
I’m allergic to bananas... still really cool though
No bananas????!!!! Stop this ride I want to get OFF!!!!
Youtube gold.
If I ever come down to florida again i'm making sure I come by to Lofty Pursuits, and hopefully see you guys make candy, this is so interesting
9:31 i've played over and over again. I can't stop laughing
Oh my goodness gracious me  Your banana candy has such appeal!
Banana flavoring is still that of the Gross Michel banana, no longer used, not recently abandoned, but many, many decades ago.  I have no idea why...
How do I get a job there? I want a job making candy.
I'm curious about how they make their banana flavouring.
I'd love to just take a bite out of the warm, slightly soft log
vcs são um casal ?
They will have gmo bananas before no bananas.
So yours tastes like bananas now? I like the taste of the old one, like laffy taffy.
I wish I had known about this place when I was in Florida visiting relatives. Maybe if I ever drag them out there again now that they've moved, we can pop by and see this place- even if you're not making candy that day, I'm sure it'd be worth looking around :)
This video showed up in my recommended a month or so ago out of the blue. For a laugh I decided to watch the video and I was amazed by the craftsmanship and genuineness of the gentleman making the candy. And it worked because I ordered a bag of these banana candies which I am currently very much enjoying as I type this comment. Thank you.
I really want a banana now
Say how many times did he say banana?
! � was gong to a crust, driving from georgia to miami florida, we passed your store and ! � was like “CAN ! � GO THERE” we passed it and ! � ended up crying
Sell me one of those rods
Isn't sugar the most produced crop?
I like the banana history mixed in with the candy making footage.
Hi lofty Pursuits, the gros michel banana is not pronounced "gross michael". it is in fact pronounced as "grow michelle". Just thought i would let you know
"gro michelle" Every time I hear "gross Michael" I die a little inside.
A world without bananas is a world I don’t wanna be in
“The center is still a blistering hot swimming pool”
There's a banana song I heard as a kid, it was from the early 1920s I heard on a old record which I think was 78 speed but anyway, all that I remember of the song was one line "Bananas ain't got no bones". You talking about bananas made me think of the song.
Lol did anyone see the boys candy fall when the guy gave it to him? 9:31
The kid dropped his candy....lol
As always, your videos are very entertaining and full of your research and knowledge!  THANK YOU!  🥖🥖 🍧 🍌🍌
If you think about it you just listened to a guy tell the history of a banana and review bananas for 10 minutes
I think he liked bananas
I have a gros Michel banana tree in my backyard, they are really good for making banana bread!
Wait, I’m really confused why I’m watching this..?
All I could think about through this whole video was that video where Tyler filled josh’s dressing room with bananas
Anyone else notice he dropped the candy when he handed it to the last kid?LMAO
I like bananas, but I think artificial banana flavor is horrible. I can't really describe this all that well, but it also gives me a strange, cold? feeling in my mouth when I eat it.
Can we get a round of applause for bananas?
Take a shot every time he says banana
My grandma has a banana tree
I really appreciate how soothing your voice is and how informative the videos are. Keep up the great work, I just found you yesterday, but I am an instant fan.
I feel happy seeing your channel grow, especially since I was here long ago, about 2 years I think, back then you weren't getting this amount of views, and I can see that you changed the logo, not sure when, haven't been watching in a while. Anyway, I just wanted to say that your videos tend to soothe me, it's not really about the candy making for me, although I used to like it ALOT, I have started liking you instead, thanks for the educational, relaxing, candy making videos. They make me feel comforted.                             Sincerely,                     a (2 year?) subcriber.
Me: “Man your candy taster is out sick and not getting paid for tasting your candy and now you ask me to do it for free it’s hard to say yes but I guess I’ll take the sacrifice of tasting candy for free ugh” said no one ever 😂😂
I wanted candy, but all i got was the death of the banana
banana~ (｡>﹏<｡)
I love candy
Excellent work
i would love that banana unicorn drop i adore the candy banana flavouring
if you bake bananas they taste like the candy i think
It’s cool seeing how this channel has changed how they make candy slightly. It hasn’t changed too much but they’ve perfected it.
Thank you for such great videos, i always enjoy watching them :)
Oh my god banana banana banana
I can't have bananas I'm allergic, but I still remember that they tasted really good.
No it's bad that we won't have banana bread!!!
Your job must be so satisfying. Kneading nearly putty and those cuts.
Need new videos
luckly for us we allready have a replacment for the cavindish ready to go!
I grew up in Wilmington, Ohio, one of many places that claims to be the originator of Banana Splits. I would love to hear you talk of the history of banana splits.   I’m an instant fan of your videos since discovering them a week ago. Thank you!
This channel isn't helping with my diet
Why exactly was I recommended this, doesn't matter, it's cool
Greg needs to do ASMR
Why am i watching a video about artificial banana flavor ???
I love your videos, I just discovered your channel the other day and it's so relaxing to watch. The banana facts are really interesting, thanks!
have you ever made dragon's beard
I love watching this while I do homework. Weird but it helps me concentrate haha
I LOVE bananas. I make homemade banana cookies using a little banana extract and real bananas. Also very often make banana bread and muffins. Also rarely make banana cake.
The story of the grosse Michael is one of my favorites and It’s always great to hear another telling of it! These videos are great, could use a little editing but overall very fun!
I've been binge watching y'all's videos and I'm obsessed!!!
The website has some good prices.
♥️ your channel!!!
Came for the show, stayed for stories about bananas
This flavor of banana is from the original banana that became exict...
I've just ordered myself a bag of these because I've always loved actual bananas but absolutely hated the taste of banana sweets, so I'm intrigued as to what banana sweets with actual modern banana flavouring tastes like, can't wait for them to arrive!
I really want a banana right now
How did you shrink a banana down that much and fit it inside there?
Who else loves watching him make candy ? It's like an addiction to me 🤣🤣🤣😭 he also explains the history of this candy and facts, I just really appreciate this ✊🏼🙌🏼
Why doesn’t this channel have 1 mil subs
Omg, I recently started watching these videos while i animate, draw, paint, etc, and they help so much when i need to concentrate!!!
I love the end when he cuts the candy it’s sooo satisfying      I never thought I’d say satisfying
Hi do you think or was made  passion fruit candies?
Ben needs to see this 💿
I want to visit your store so badly! It looks so wonderful there, there's handmade candy, a LOT of ice creams, sundaes, AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, THE BIG BANANA! It's too bad that I live all the way in Arizona. The literal other side of the US
Eating this candy while watching the video
Why am i watching thus ive got braces and can't eat lollies
the amount of times he says banana....
It looks like slime!!!
Take a shot very tome he says banana
When did your store open?
frozen bananas taste like 'artificial' banana
I find it fasinating how the image in the candy gets smaller as it gets stretched but is still perfect. These look good. I always liked banana Popsicles .
I just received some of these candies in a bag of mixed image creations from Lofty Pursuits and my goodness they were outstanding. Loved them. Definitely gonna need some more soon!
Thank you YouTube for guiding me to this channel. You love me, you really love me!
I live down in Sanford FL I love watching your videos they are very relaxing. I hope we can come up and see you when we take vacation next week
I like your videos but I have a question. When you cut the candy howcome you dont cut them into perfect cylinders instead of having them jagged?
Actually, the song 'Yes, we have no bananas' was about the banana plague that virtually wiped out the Gross Michael. I'm surprised the narrator didn't seem to know this. Interesting video tho'.
This was my first video that I watched
There is a vault in Finland that keeps a storage of all "food" plants from around the world. so there is always a backup for if it becomes natually extinct.
Anybody count how many times he hooked that strip of candy?
This series is addictive and sweet as the candy itself.
There are tons of banana species! I can name like 10 varieties I can easily find here in Brazil. And most of the candied banana I have ever had tastes like bananas, usually made with the fruit.... the one that looks like fig candy.
I love your videos, but I can't stand hard candy. I'm a salt water taffy kinda guy.
Look for this video on Youtube: "42 Seconds of a Candy Maker Saying Banana *BANANA SUPERCUT*" A fan told Greg during a live Q&A that she made this video and he watched it and found it really funny :)
I tried this today and it was wonderful! I personally love banana-flavoured things.
right over 10 minutes to get more ad revenue going huh?
Well, our banana candies taste like bananas.
This candy store is amazing. Last time I went, I bought one of their unicorn droppings and my god it's a hell of a bargain.
Can you make the delivery to Romania too?
This man just seems like such a nice guy. It makes me happy.
Wait!? I thought eveyone peeled bananas from the flower end. WTF??? I would see cartoons and video game characters peelings there bananas from the flower end.
I just received 2 small bags of these. They look just like the video and they are delicious. Shipping took a while, but they let me know they were backed up and sent me updates (including about the storm).  Once I finish these I'll be ordering more.
this was weirdly interisting
do you ship to other countries
omg he said "apeel" instead of apeal
Dude what a freaking cool video
This was..entertaining
7:45 blew my mind
I'VE WATCHED THIS VIDEO, ARE YOU HAPPY NOW YOUTUBE?
*peel a banana
I absolutely love the commentary and history and so does my four month old! Thank you guys!
i donno about this one i first thought it was a mealworm
I got way more education  out of this that I ever expected. Pretty darn cool
Okay, bud. I like your videos, but this one got me subbed. Do you have a Patreon account?
So interesting for so many reasons!  Watching you make the candy is hypnotic as always.  But the banana facts really stole the show for me this time.  I knew about the monoculture problem but did not realize it was related to that artificial banana flavour mystery.  Why on earth can't people cultivate different varieties?  I think it would be awesome to be able to go to the store and buy different kinds of bananas the way you can with oranges and apples.  I'm sure there are reasons but I'd love to know more about them.  And the banana peeling thing...my jaw dropped.  How did we not know that?
I this channel so much
Tallahassee is only like 3-4 hours, but I'm too lazy to drive. 😩😩😩
I love this channel. I don't know why I like it so much, since I don't like history, but this guy makes learning SO MUCH better! I guess I like it because he's nice and it's relaxing to watch the candy being made.  He's so talented! Love ya man!
I live in Florida but I dont live in Tallahassee but I plan to go to FSU
I never liked bananas :P
I'm hooked on you guys lately. Hopefully soon I can visit your shop. That would be awesome! Keep up the good work and positive energy you bring to everyone! 🍭 🍬🍨🍡
Damn, did not think I would learn this much about bananas today.  Have a whole new respect for them
I'm going to Florida for thanksgiving and I am definitely making a stop in Tallahassee for you.
This channel and history is so amazing ive learnt more from you in a day then ive done in many days at school
With diseases affecting bananas and many other crops that is one of the reasons I'm in support of GM food as long as it's fully tested first.
How much does this usually cost
I love these videos, since it's so satisfying.
its pronounced gro (long O sound) meeshel not gross micheal.
SAVE THE BANANAS
Because banana is a terrible flavor for candy
I think I learned more about bananas in 10 minutes here, than I learned about bananas in the last 30 something years.
I like these videos
I always enjoy the history commentary on these videos.
If I ever go to Florida I'll be sure to check u out
These diagrams that you do on some videos are very useful. Would've been great if you'd done them on the TARDIS video.
I love this
So happy to find your company.
Rip banana
Oh, man. I absolutely love that artificial banana flavor.
In the thumbnail it looks so squishy. I was decieved
Before bananas die out make a lot of your natural flavor and store it
This is amazing!! Whered you learn to do this!?
say, y isnt the Unicorn droppings sold online? won't a pack of "a little bit of everything" the best wat to find out which one u like most instead of ordering them one by one, not knowing whether u'll enjoy them or not?
The banana looks like a maggot
When I first learned about gross michael's, I randomly speculated THAT was the flavor I was tasting in banana flavored candy.   It wasn't until I saw this video that I realized one of my wild speculations turned out to be true d:
i hope they're safe during the hurricane
Honestly this guy is amazing just he sounds so nice, is this just me?
the fact that i learn something new with every video of your i watch makes me so happy!
I'm quite surprised that americans peeled bananas wrong... I thought everyone pealed them from the top, it just seemed logical to me.
You're eating bananas wrong. You are supposed to eat them with the shell.
I am so glad to see one video on youtube about how we use to eat a different type of banana without hearing people in the vid spout myths about humans eating the Fat Michael banana out of existence. Cudos to you, sir.
to much history
Just got these in the mail along with a heart lolly, absolutely worth it <3
I wish I could find my passion like you you look so happy when your working with the candy
Take a shot every time he says banana 🍌
Too bad I'm allergic 🙁
I hate all flavors of banana. But I get why people like them
That's crazy a banana shape comes out of that!
Just received the banana candy in the mail today and I absolutely love it!! Tastes just like a nice ripe banana :)
Eu moro no Brasil e nunca fui a outro país, mas deu vontade de sair daqui só pra comer um doce desses...

Svalbard will save our Bananas
I wanna try one of those candies!
it's pronounced grow me-shell
Wheres the videso
Hey, good luck and be safe during the upcoming storm.
You should make an easy one that is an egg and all you have to do is put yellow in the middle and white on the outside and then role it and cut it.
Is there anywhere that I can buy this
I don't know why... but I watch these videos so much, especially yours. For some reason they are just so soothing and relaxing to watch and see how something I enjoy so much is made...
Banana isn't a word anymore
Warning, he says banana a lot.
Yo yo so I'm from England and bloody love bananas, going to orlando soon, how long does it take to drive to Tallahassee from Orlando? Cheers 😂
these candies look so  APEALLING
Excuse my language BUT HOW THE HELL DID YOU MAKE 100k SUBS IN A WEEK CONGRATS U MIGHT BE THE FASTEST GROWIBG YOUTUBER I HAVE EVER SEEN DOBT FORGET ME WHEN YOU HIT 1,000,000
Have you ever made the candy that has that fizzy stuff in the middle? If so, I would LOVE seeing how that's made! 😃👍🏻  Your videos are awesome, thank you! ❤️
It has been my dream for the longest time to eat the candy while it's still soft
I want some :(
b a n a n a
I've seen some candy companies use white coloring to make it white instead of pulling, why do you use the pulling method?
I subbed and turned on the bell icon and liked
Id stop in if I had a place to park my truck lol
I found this while I was eatting a banana
what if you were to eat the candy while it was still hot, what would it taste like?
Do they ship candy to different states?
When you guys add the food coloring and have to boil off the water why dont you guys use alcohol based coloring as it has a lower boiling point
Nintendo switch hard candy?
You should do some sour candy
I straight up thought he meant he was going to eat like an old ass candy
we do have plantains
I got addicted to your channel after two VIEDOSSSSS!!!
Are you by any chance planning to  be making candy this coming Wednesday? i have some friends coming from florida, i live in alabama, we may pop in for a visit
I had banana milk once and I was very surprised it didn't taste artificial. it tasted just like a real banana, if a little unripened
do you own the shop?
how much do you get when you buy one bag of candy?
hope you still does this candys in a few years
when im moving from my home in some years i will buy this candys they look tasty
Do you ship to Denmark?
he said bannana 259 times
its like i just watched a documentary and got a hard on
I went and got a banana split after this
How long would shipping be to South Florida?
That's cool but for some reason my favorite is the watermelon one
I am now the the video
I might need to fly out to Florida this looks so gooooooooooood
Why not try making malted milk candies? I'm not sure why but my family currently can't get enough of that nostalgic flavour!
This is so relaxing...
Do you have a link to that Fastball cover song at the end?
My family is going to Destin, FL next year, and my mom and I decided that we would spend a day in Tallahassee, so we might come see you!
Satisfying
hey humans can dygest corn so why do we eat it
The food coloring looks like red food coloring
What version is "outta my head" playing in the background? that is awesome.
Have you guys ever tryed coconut flavoring If thats sutch a thing
My God does anyone else think Greg should write a candy making and candy facts book...😋🍌🍌🍦🍫🍬🍭
I'm obsessed with seeing him cut the candy 😆
Keep em comin!
I hate banana .
Have you ever made international flag candy for example america or canada
nah, artificial banana actually /does/ taste like a modern banana- however youll usually only taste it in a squished, over ripe banana.
I love this channel!!
Ive been watching your vids for a while now, and i must say, they are amazing! Good luck in the future! :) I'll be sticking around from now. Even at mill subs :)
Who else literally only came to watch him cut it at the end
5:33 I always thought the yellow wrap gave our banana candy it's aPEEL heheheh
Challenge time: Have a drink of Beer, everytime he says *Banana.*
I always new that
Does any of you're candy have gelatine, alcoholic substances or meat products??
Do Rick and Morty candy! A good design for the candy would be the portal gun's portal, what Rick uses!
Your voice reminds of of John Goodman and I love it
This is such a wholesome video.
Hello from France ! Nice work, I will order some of your candies on your website, need to taste them :D
i love these
Huh, nice to see YouTube unsubscribed me to you guys. Was wondering why you weren't uploading, you were it's just I never saw it in my sub box.
It's pronounced like "grow michelle" not gross michael lol.
Great video! I was wondering if you could do a separate video on the Merry go Round or Skyscraper ice cream dish, since not much comes up when I try to search for the history of them.
You should sell the full hard candy rods! I would buy a whole bag!
I just subbed and I think you should do an eclipse candy
How many times did they say banana in this video?
You should make a candy that looks like a SUSHI ROLL  🍣🍢🍜🍚🍙🍱🍘
Oh man I live kinda close to this  And it was recommended to me Is this fate or coincidence
Ive been wanting to ask is the cant Halal, i know its mainly sugar and such but you use flavorings and ive been wanting to know if they are Halal as ive accudebtly spent £20+ on candy that ended up being mostly haram/not okay for me to eat, ive really been wanting to order some but i cant do it until i know.
WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE ICEBURG SLIME
Not too far in the future when a new disease pops up for a crop, it will be likely that the crop would get genetically modified so that it is resistant. The technique CRISPR makes it very easy and cheap! All it needs is some time to get developed as it is still relatively new technology.
This is so wholesome
nothings better then handmade candy
I feel like I can here him singing in the background at the end
HEY!can you show bus how you make your sundaes?that'll be a cool video to watch!
Cool. I live near pensicola. So one day I might stop by
How's it's made
its nice to just watch these videos and sit back and relax. its so nice to watch em yet i may not care for sweets at the time. i just like them. the stretching of the candy to make it white is pretty satisfying too and its just nice to see these types of videos every now and again :)
The yellow wrap is what gives our banana candy it's great A-PEEL!  ahahaha Love it
Just discovered this channel... I love candy and I love your vids... It's very interesting watching you make, and describe your work... Love it and +sub
This would be a real challenge, but could you make doge or pepe candies?
Here I need to advocate GMOs. The hawaiian Papaya had a similar threat, the ringspot virus. Genetic engineering gave it permanent immunity and saved it - with no tradeoffs.  Now, the panama disease is a fungal disease, and a pretty bad one, with no viable fungicide to combat it. Though a fungus and not a virus, the immunity (not only resistance, which gives the pathogen the chance to adapt!) can be implemented in the banana.
can you make exo candy
This guy is so pure...
i love you guys. I went to CCA for culinary school, pastry and baking. i love making candy. i have a problem with humidity if i make candy on a rainy day here in Ca. how do you deal with the humidity and sugar in Florida?
I have a game you can play, drink every time he says banana. Enjoy!
Please tell me someone counted how many times he said bannana????
Your videos are just like what you make! I can't watch it every day, and I cant just watch one, but when I do start I get a new appreciation for the content you produce and enjoy every second of your content!
Do u ship to the uk?
This mans voice is so soothing
So there is over 200 species of bananas actually. There is all kinds of colors too Green ones Red ones even. the thing is about the banana we know and love its hard for the American people who all as a culture and together decide what is mainstream to sell in stores to accept new kinds of fruit. Even when the banana was first introduced it was hard for everyone to like them. They had to start selling the banana's at an incredibly low price, lower then the apple which was dominating sells during the time. And the thing is it worked it, when they started selling them so low it actually beat the apple in the market. It was kind of a Hell Mary for the sellers if they were ever going to make it in America. So the thing is about the Panama disease is that it constantly changes and is incredibly infectious. if you even step in infected soil then step in uninfected soil it ruins the whole crop. Also you can never plant that species of banana ever again in that spot. The banana is actually very fascinating even if its not my favorite fruit lol
Why do i find this so interesting...
i just gotten this video recommended to me and i must say great video well edite nice voice over like able character about a topic that isnt really interesting but interesting enough to be kept busy while you do repetitive things in the proces
"Yes! We have no bananas"?!?!?!  I LOVE THAT SONG
i would hate to touch that boiling hot candy
"I've always thought that the yellow wrap is what gives our banana candy it's great a-peel"
I think it will be nice to eat it before he cuts it. It will be an epic experience :p
I luuuve nannas!     Oh, my pancreas is hiding now.
U r amazing my mom loves vid like this a lot and me to
Mispronouncing Cavendish when you said it correctly 30 seconds before. Cute and gross.
I A M L E A R N I N G W H I L E W A T C H I N G C A N D Y B E M A D E  Y U M
The chopping of the candy was rare art
You guys should make a sour grape candy. Mmm my favorite
this is the most wholesome youtube channel
I like the old banana flavor very much! It's often my favorite flavor in candies.
i really had a hard time enjoying this with the background music, something without lyrics might be better with the amount of speaking in the video..
try making caramel
MMM... OHHH yES11!111
Have you ever thought of making your candy on a livestream?
I want some banana candy :(
I don't know why this was recommended to me, but I enjoyed this video.
Does your site ship to Canada? It was gonna let me go through with payment but I don't know the rules of shipping organic matter and it doesn't say anything that I can find about it on their website.
I've heard a lot of people say that the story about the flavor being based off of Gros Michel was just a myth, and that both Cavendish and Gros Michel have the same main chemical that provides their flavor, and the banana flavoring is just based off of that chemical and nothing else. It's not that it was specifically designed to be the Gros Michel, just that it happens to taste a little closer to it.
Hey there! Love your videos, so I was wondering if you could ever do image candy with it being an image of Elma from miss kobayashi's dragon maid. This came from the end of the opening song where when they cut up the (eraser?) with Elma's face on it and it kinda looks like when you guys cut up the candy.
I learned many things about banana
How did I get here???
Is it just me or does the older 50's music set the mood? I just heard it playing rockin' robin in the background and thought it was cool.
Every time u hear banana take a shot
RIP candy that fell out of the boys hand
no bananas, no bees. :<
it's 3a.m. and I start my senior in 4 hours. I need help
watching this videos to go to sleep easier :)
Im eating a banana while watching this video
Greg do a candy give away and well you are at it u should send me some of that black currant candy because me and my dad found this pepsi call black currant cola and we love it so i was wondering how your candys tasted in comparison to the soda
There are like 50 different flavors of this the banana is good but the pomegranate is the best
Why has this been in my recommended for weeks now?
Thanks for the fun informative video. Now I know how to properly open bananas!
I HATE artificial banana flavor!! I love bananas but artificial banana makes me want to throw up
This channel is amazing. I think it would be cool to see a dragon fruit, passion fruit, and guava flavor hard candy. I don't think I've ever seen candies in those flavors.
This guy is so interesting and cool lol Xd
Mmmm hard candy :)
Hi Great video thanks for the load of information. I hate bananas.
Wait          There was a LITERAL Banana PLAGUE?
This video was very satisfying. Especially that part where the dude chopped the candy into pieces.
I have no idea how google knew to recommend this but I am glad they did! Love the channel!
I laughed at the very end when he hands a kid who has his hand out a candy and he immediately drops it lmao
wait, aren't rosemary and thyme herbs with a woody stem?
What do you think about the idea of making a video showing us how to make a small batch using household items so the ones who want to experience the making of hard candy can do so
very fascinating! i was surprised to see no machines used to pull and cut the candy, makes me wish i lived near by you guys
Don't know how I got here, but I love this video.
I love hard candy, but I especially love it when it has a gooey center to look forward to. Like those raspberry candies and strawberry candies. Love the gooey centers!
Fascinating! Loved it!
I have no idea how this ended up in my feed, but I'm glad it did lol
Many you're awesome my dude. I can really feel your enjoyment of your work. I can feel how you love your work. Also the process is awesome to see.
You should make some poop 💩 emoji candy 🍭                              Please don't                    Jk
PEEL FROM THE BANANUS!
0:54 - 1:22 omg why do i find that candy getting lifted and cut sooo satisfying ._. I wish i could come and watch u make candy but im too far away... :(
BUT! Now I will be making a road trip just to see you guys.
I have been watching you for years. I could kick myself. I drove through Tallahassee a few times this year and forgot to stop!!!!!
This guy is bananas
"Complexities and overtones" are you kidding me? Bananas are incredibly bland.The modern ones that is.
Do a mango flavor or something
I eat bananas EVERY DAY and it was great to get so much info about them in this video. Great job.
You think bananas are a monoculture? You come over to India, you'll be proven wrong.
so relaxed rn
This video is try not to get satisfied IMPOSSIBLE
Not mad that this was in my suggestions
... *buys plane tickets*
This is much better.
I don't know why youtube recommended this channel to me, but I'm glad it did.
you should make a pikachu face in a piece of candy..that would be so cool
How many times did he say bananas?😐
this video was oddly satisfying
Hey lofty pursuits what is the name of this song? There's 2 remakes I can identify the chorus is in I would like to have this 1950s version. Seems to be the original can anyone help? It's the ending song,  it says can't get you out of my head, can't get you out of my mind
If u have an instagram ... does that mean... BANANAS HAVE FISH LIPS????
Him: bananas might not exist later Me: NOOO!!!!!!
I love the song We Have No Bananas! My favorite version is The Pied Piper's one... I wish people would appreciate more that kind of music more
do your employees have dental coverage? They better, working in a candy shop and whatnot.
That cutting near the end is so cool to watch.
Can you try coconut ☺
One of the stupidest things You tube does is put ads at the end of videos.  I can skip the whole thing that way.
This is art!
It's sold here in Scotland in the rods and it's called "rock"
I love this
I love the Gros Michel flavor of banana candy so much more than I do the flavor of the Cavendish bananas we eat today. They're just so bland and disappointing. The Cavendish is generally considered markedly inferior to its predecessor and it's not hard to see why, honestly. You can really only find them in limited quantities now, mostly where the blight never reached. I'm really disappointed that I missed out on getting to have them as the generic banana. :(
It throws me for a loop when I hear people mention highways like I-10 cuz I think they're here in San Antonio and I'm so used to all highways just looping around only my town lol so to think that same road goes all the way to the other side of The Gulf is just bananas haha
Is this candy vegan?
Fun drinking game - Take a shot everytime "banana" is said
who else wants to eat it while its soft
1:47 - looks like a great upper body workout
How the dafuq did I get here I was watching how to strip a ak for first day of school
when he was cutting super fast at the end i was too distracted by that to pay attention to what he was saying xD
Every time you say "Gros Michel" i die a little inside
You guys are the coolest
I only clicked on this video because it wouldn't stop showing up in my recommended videos, hoping it would go away if I finally watched it...
Woah 200k nice
Take a shot every time he says "banana" or "bananas".
You should make strawberry rhubarb custard candy. It's my grandmothers favorite
Wow, a very entertaining and informative video!
I know I already commented, but will you make a special video when you reach a million subscribers? I think you're gonna get there pretty soon!
[insert this video title here] but every banana is replaced with a random video from this channel but every candy it gets faster but every time his head shows up onscreen it resumes the original video
I would come to buy some candies but i live reeeeeeeeaaaaaaly far away, in the meaditeranian see
Gross Michael as in "grow me-SHELL", its French, don't use the English pronunciation
Why was this recommended to me I don't even like banana
All these years i have been pelling bananas the right way
If you reply to this comment I will spoil game of thrones
Idk how I got here , but I'm here...
Why don't we have this in the UK
I love that you use an anvil for cutting!
Do you make candy from other countries, if so could you make colters candy.
I am watching the video and and eating the same candy
Not exactly what i expected, but cool.
that sounds like the best shop/store ever
I wanna go all the way to where you're based which is far for me because I'm Irish just to see you make the candy
banana laughy taffy taste exactly like real nanners. fact.
No idea how I ended up here, but damn  I am glad I did ! lol Good movie.
So... what was the answer to the main question again? I got a lot of info in this video but it seemed like he kind of trailed of from ever directly and explicitly answering why they don't use normal banana flavor in candy very often... He mentions most bananas being one strain and, due to this, alludes to them being at danger for disappearing in the future... but that's the future. Why do most not use real banana even NOW, in the present, when we still have tons of bananas?
ads are gettin smarter
Bananas are the nastiest thing on earth, it proves there is no god.
I'm sure that this advertisement will push sales! Love how non-manufactured and home made the process is!
Wow I have a certain fascination with Bananas and I have found a new source thanks  I wish I could visit your  shop Please  can you mention your e mail catalog
Why tf is this in my recommended?
i want some candy now
I thought the banana shape in the candy was a bug larva
This guy is good at talking. But in a good way.
Uuugh I'm so hungry now...
Am I the only one that hasn't had a banana split before? I'm 17
6:44  Oh my gosh.  Thank you for explaining the WHY of peeling a banana from the correct end. 7:13  Haha.  That was funny.
Ok YouTube, I watched it, can you leave me alone now?
Get out of my recommendations!
nice candy. what does it taste like??
The candies look so nice, but if i buy some it will need weeks to ship them to germany :D
That poor kid who dropped the candy as soon as he got it. XD
BANANA W A R
This candy is really pretty btw. Nice job!
I really want to make candy now!
good storytelling about something I'd normally not care about
Victorian Banana Candy or why does banana candy typically not taste like bananas? but everytime they say banana it speeds up
I miss the Gros Michel, and I've never even tasted it!
i live really close to the store like 35 mins from talahassee
hahahahahaahha "NATURAL FLAVORS" IN USA???? HHAAHAHAHAAAH
10/10 healthy
I'm fine with the "artificial" flavorings.  Banana candy tastes a hell of a lot better than bananas.
Reminds me of clear slime when he used the hook
I love those, but you hardly find any where I live. At least I now know what they're called. Still baffled how the image came out so bananalike
The candy cutting is so satisfying
I love bananas but I get sick if I eat them 😞
I peel the banana from the middle, I score one of the inverse  grooves, and pull open.
You would get very sticky teeth if you try to eat it soft
Would've loved the candy if it was soft.
Let's play a game, take a shot every time he says banna
I can't stand the smell or taste of bananas! But this was fascinating to watch and listen to :)
This channel is so relaxing.
Do these guys make any soft lollies?
I want to poke the candy like fluffy slime! No? Nobody else? Oh... Well then ill just go..
Oh don't remind me of possible banana extinction. Oh, and genetic engineering may design a banana that is resilient to fungal diseases.
this. is. so. SATISFYING!
Can you ship your candies to Canada?
Id like to order 20 metric tonnes xD
Hey fellas I was wondering what happens when you do make a mistake or distorted the image of the candy?
the last step of making the candy was mesmerizing😍😍😍 that's some serious skill
Have you tried eating some of the candy before it's hard but cold enough to eat
looks so good
Bananas need genetic diversity. The problem is the banana growers and sellers don't want to have completely inconsistent bananas. I would argue they should just get over it.
I live in Tallahassee but it's been years since I've been to Lofty Pursuits. Definitely need to stop by sometime and see if I can get lucky and catch you making candy.   Sadly I can no longer eat ice cream, because dairy doesn't like me, but it was Soo good.
Banana, banana, banana :) Somebody gotta show this to Nanners :P
That bit where he flipped the candy to make it white was hypnotic.
poison
That's not how those banana names are pronounced and you grossly misrepresented flavoring.
velvet underground
This reminds me of Fallout4 for some reason. I hope a nuclear fallout doesn't wipe out the banana monoculture.
Feels out for that poor candyless kid
I'm ready glad I find your channel. Your voice reminds me of mark hamils and your knowledge is strange and beautiful. Keep up the complexities
I feel proud that I knew modern bananas are clones, and to peel them from the bottom. I didn't know they used to have huge seeds though, that's pretty crazy. And watching candy being made like this is so entertaining, I'm glad this randomly popped up in my suggestions or whatever.
Rice, Corn and Wheat are the top most cultivated foods?   I honestly thought Potatoes would be up there too!
In Latvia they make lots off these candys and lots off flavours and they sell them in every store there business is doing reely good and they make a good gift
This video was randomly suggested by YouTube to me, not sure why but very interesting anyway. A couple of points... Yes I'm sure lots of people have said but it's a French name pronounced "grow Michelle". Here in the UK, we call this kind of candy "rock" and it's usually sold at  seaside resorts with the name of the place in the middle, where you have used a banana image, and normally minty in taste.
Okay Youtube. I watched it. Now stop recommending it.
I'm gonna buy the candies.
How do you make a natural flavor taste realistic? Doesn't the quality of the flavor decay during production?
I'm expecting pumpkin candies for Halloween.
It's not called 'Hard Candy' it's called rock
Send this to Yoshiko
why do u not sell unicorn droppings
Why am I watching a video all about bananas when I actually hate bananas?
I want to go to you guys but I can't leave Texas
a banana is a circular hexagon
This guy is so interesting
I thought the banana was a worm in the thumbnail so I clicked
Wow
the kid at the end who dropped the candy -lol, eager boy
If wild varieties still exist, then it's theoretically possible to breed a few varieties of that. Maybe make it not a monoculture anymore, with all the crazy cloning. That way if one variety gets hit by a disease, you've got a backup.
It's great to see someone who is that passionate about his trade and bananas.... But how did I end up here?
Hi Mr. Greg! today was a holiday called Play Lax Day, a holiday us lacrosse players celebrate as an excuse to drop everything and fool around all day with lacrosse sticks. So in honor of this, could you make a lacrosse stick image candy? I know its probably a challenge, but that's good right?
Have you tried making a life size light saber out of candy cause that would be spectacular.
as weird as it sounds, i actually love artificial banana flavor, it's one of the very few artificial flavors i really like lol
I have that same anvil
I've seen candy videos where people use white food coloring instead of pulling. Is there a difference in flavor between these two techniques, and why would a person do one or the other?
Aww, I love this kind of hard candy, the little tube-shaped ones with the picture.  I always look for them at Christmas and can almost never find them nearby...
It's not pronounced 'gross Michael' it's pronounced 'grow Michelle'
Hey, do you by chance make gummy candy?
Hey lofty pursuits I live in the keys and next time I drive up to the mainland I'll stop by
yeesh, droppin hard truth about bananas during a fun video... makes me sad
Never had a banana split before, only saw people eat it on tv...
wow I wanna go here some day *o*
STOP RECOMMENDING IT TO ME YOUTUBE. I WATCHED OK? THERE. NOW STOP IT.
It's always cool to watch you making the candy. I bet the manufacturer of that anvil never thought it would be used for this though. ;-)
You know, being a candy maker teaches you alot of things other than just candy. This video got you a new subscriber.
You guys should do a live video
Why is this in my recomended?
I don't know why this was in my recommended but I'm glad it was.
I want to go to that store/restaurant  but its too far! Someday... someday
What is the video where you talk about the candy making table?
"it was a spectacular banana by all accounts"... the narrator is a treasure <3
i thought that was a worm
I don't know what it is, but there is something about watching someone make this stuff that's oddly satisfying. I remember watching people making fudge when I was young, and just being fascinated by the process. I'm an adult, and I'm still fascinated by fudge making, and in this case, hard candy making. It's just neat in a way that I can't really describe.  In regards to your comment about peeling bananas wrong, I was shocked to hear about that too. Monkeys apparently peel them from the bottom, or the "flower-end" as you call it, so I tried it one day and it worked a treat. You don't even need a knife like shown in this video: just pinch the black part and it will separate, then just take the pieces and peel them off. Works amazing, and so much better than peeling from the stem side.  (Gah! I just watched further in the video and you mentioned it the monkey thing. Oh well, a little redundancy never hurt anyone never hurt anyone.)
This is fantastic. thanks for sharing.
I might stop in some time if I am in the area! This is really cool guys!
you look like i expect a candy maker to look like
WOOOOOW. PAPUA NEW GUINEA FOR THE WIN!
I've always peeled my bananas from the bottom and my friends call it weird
get. out. of. my. recommended.
y'all the coolest, love these videos
y is it so relaxing
i really loved the video it was great but the videos edditing style and format could some work but it was great love ya
I'm guessing this has something to do with bananas.
Then buy organic banans, it helps both the enivornment and the poor people who agricult it.
I never thought to learn the history of the banana, but here i am.
That looks fun to make but I'd probably burn myself
Go bananas b a n a n n a!
wow 4am watching a random business make banana flavored candy LOL
Why did I watch this whole video...
I have no idea how I ended here, but I regret nothing.
Just threw a piece at that kid on the end eh? heheheh
that was a banana? i thought it was some kinda worm D:
Why am I so engaged in a video of a guy putting things on a hook and talking about bananas
Bananas.......
They said banana so many times that it doesn't sound right anymore.
I learned so much from this video! So cool
Good job on the dialogue.
Banana
What do banana split taste like? I've never had one. Please dun bully meh 😂
Bananas are disgusting
Idk why I watched this but I'm glad I did
anyone else think they should set up a camera focused on their tables and just stream their candy making constantly?
This is very strangely entertaining
I don't even like bananas but I like watching this
I want to own a candy shop. So I a open one
I love banans
....I just watched a man in a candy shop rant about bananas while making candy for ten minutes... Why was it so enjoyable?
Hello lofty pursuits! Big fan of the channel, and plan to visit Tallahassee in the future! I have a question/suggestion though, have you ever made an image of a rainbow or clover in your hard candy? I think it'd be a good theme for St.Patricks Day (Even though it's a long way away)
mfw i go from serb jna music to this.
Really interesting, good job!
How does this channel have so many subscribers? Don't get me wrong I love lofty Pursuits, I'm a Tallahassee native, I'm confused though
He should make a candy play button!
At the beginning all I heard was Tallanasty Florida. I feel nasty now.
Wtf am I waching??
FINE I WATCHED IT
people peel a banana from the stem end? what the hell
thx YouTube
How lovely to see something so crafty and light hearted, after visiting the dark side of dank and other creepy goop internet is known for on youtube.
I mean you can just genetically modify our current bananas so that they can't die off due to the disease.
Not to be "that guy", but the old banana variety was "Gros Michel". You yanks would pronounce it "Grow Michelle".   And now back to your regularly programmed banana.
You should make salty liquorice hard candy, like salmiakki.
im gonna do homework...*an hour later* ooooo bananass
thanks for the vid! very informational and a nice change for me on youtube!
Mexican candy is somewhat authentic in flavor. They have this banana flavored gum (not sure of the brand name) but it tastes just like a real banana.
Well, video recommendations is broken again.
its Because its old its from 1500s
Bananas are clones of each other.  Wonder how we could get away from that...
Pretty sure this is what we call 'rock' in England. You get it in sticks, i.e 'a stick of rock' and the image runs through the entire thing. Its usually just sugar, no flavour. Although I've never had handmade stuff, its all cheap nasty carnival-prize-level of quality.  excellent commentary btw
wooow great candy.. pure sugar.. disgusting
Do you ship 'em to other countries? I really wanna buy some of them tho.
Knew my banana knowledge was seriously lacking.
What do you mean by "rice", "corn" and "wheat"? Isn't wheat classified as a "corn" crop? Look it up. Google it.
Im surprised the plastic spoons dont melt/ warp in such hot sugar
I'm allergic to bananas
I just spent 10 minutes of my life listening to a guy talking about bananas over some hypnotizingly satisfying clips of someone making banana candy.
I don't like bananas. But now I want a banana 🍌
Never before have I been so educated about a fruit.
I want hard candy now
Drinking game Take a shot every time he says banana
Gros Michel is pronounced "Gro Mishel"
This kept getting recommended to me despite me never ever watching candy related videos.
I did not expect THAT method of cutting them into pieces!
How to get diabetes
Will you speak at my funeral?
was eating a banana while watching this ;)
Why don't you guys ship to Brazil? I'm craving these candy so bad now and I can't buy them.
You should make a giant banana, just don't make small rolls, sell one big banana.
Brilliant!!
awwww now i really regret the times I left the bananas to spoil on the kitchen counter. I'm not gonna let that happen again... well, I'll try my best by reminding myself of this.
What an excellent combination of advertisement, how-it's-made and education. Really enjoyed that, great video!
so many useless bannan facts srsly
I've heard those strands on the bananas contain a lot of good bacteria though
Literally an amazing video. I know more than I did before and I know exactly where to get some. Marketing genius.
Genius move putting your store show on YouTube like this.  I just made an order for your candies myself.  I can't wait to find out if it's as good as it looks.
Ok finally i am going to watch the video OK GET IT OFF MY RECCOMENDED LIST!!!!
why cant this video just act like a banana and split out of my recommended videos.
That was one of the most interesting videos about bananas that I have ever watched
Once i found a seed in a banana, when i said this in my classroom,everybody thought i was crazy
This is cool.
Idk why each time you stretch the amber candy on the hook I'm scared that you'll impale your wrist in the hook
Unicorn droppings?...how something so gross can actually taste well
This is so amazing next time I get paid in buying some of this stuff it's so cool
Why, oh why, did I get here after a Jim Sterling video.
Damn he cuts the pieces fast...
Drinking game: Take a shot every time he says banana
Who ate a banana after this video😂😂🤤
(h3h3 coughing)
What a great craft and history! Good luck with your delicious goods!
The thumbnail looked like a small fruit with a worm in it
What a lovely video :-)
banana fibers are more healty
I found this really, really interesting... this is really cool.
take a shot everytime he says banana
Man I miss Tally
"hard"
Fascinating video! Thank you for sharing this process.
I watched it youtube, CAN YOU STOP RECOMMENDING IT ALREADY?!
Why isnt there a too stop the disease?
I wonder what old extinct fruits would taste like..
I've been peeling bannanas that ways for years
I'm not quite sure why YouTube recommended me a 10 minute video about a candy I've never had...
Like this video, I just am starting a crusade to correct people who say "decimated", to be 'decimated' means to lose 1/10th of your population or army or whatever, so being decimated may have been bad for morale on the battlefield, but it isnt that bad when losing the total number of whatever you're talking about.
Non clickbait video that actually has substance. Rare af.
cayndee
I was wondering, could you please make rock candy like you can get at British beaches? That would be amazing!
TL:DW The banana essence they still make, is based on the banana strain that died a long time ago. The bananas we eat today are different strand. There's still a risk that a disease will do the same to the current banana.
I can only imagine Tyler and Josh from Twenty Øne Pilots reacting to your views on bananas because they hate them 😂
These bananas... Somebody post banana... Banana banana banana!
5:25 the candy looks like a hotdog
I've never wanted to pop by Florida so badly in my life.
9:30 poor kid
Fascinating video
if bananas die out soon then i'm in trouble. it's the only thing i can eat with 100% certainty that i wont get nauseous and vomit.
Lmaoa
I've never learnt so much about bananas
You guys are in Florida! Too bad Tallahassee is too far away...
The Chiquita rolls you described sounds like the Puerto Rican food Pasteles, which is mashed green banana steamed with shredded pork. It's a pretty popular food here in Hawaii as well, I highly recommend you try it someday it's really delicious!
Why was this in my recommended?
that moment when you realized you've been peeling bananas wrong your whole life...
#savethebanana
Dog it's like 4 in the morning why am I here
Always glad to see someone spreading the awareness of the threats to bananas! Now if only you can explain to me the distinct unacceptable lack of banana ice cream I seem to find all over the place!
And that's why I always tell everyone that every banana you have ever eaten was genetically identical
Hahahaha, I the same exact anvil for forging my knives!
How to fuck do you move your hand that fast when cutting the candy?
There is just something oddly satisfying to this
I like cheese
Do you only sell the pieces, never the whole stick of rock?
I really enjoy how your candy videos are not only making the candy and talking about your shop but you fill them with tons of facts and stories based on the design being made. Thank you for that.
I have a candy question, WTF is Blue Raspberry? and why is it so much more common than blueberry? I know there are some blueberry flavored candies but they are not nearly as common as blue raspberry . Is there even a real blue raspberry fruit?
Who the hell peels a banana from the stem
I would have every type of diabetes if I had that job...
YASSS FLORIDA if I have time I would love to come up there
5:17 "The world would be a much sadder place if the world did not have banana splits" Truer words were never spoken.
Klonopin?
gros michel not gros michael
If you want to know why modern banana candies don't taste like bananas we know today it's bc the artificial flavoring for candies is so old that it was based off of a different kind of banana that no longer exists today.
Ya but ciquitta had slave workers for years sssoooo ya
I don't know why I watch these videos but I do and I Will keep watching them
I never knew anvils were used to make candy.
This is genius marketing!
i enjoyed the history of it all   ;)
So why don't artical cherry, strawberry, watermelon, lime, and apple flavors taste like their natural counterparts.
My arms are aching just watching you pull and pull and pull and pull that candy. I think it would drive me bonkers if I had to do that all the time.
I watched your damn video YouTube. Stop putting in my reccomended
If you want a seedless banana you are going to have to accept that it must be cloned. Potatoes are the same way - every russet potato you have ever eaten is genetically identical.  I'm sure the search is on for a replacement for the Cavendish, but it's likely that we may see a few decades where the only bananas commonly available are GMO. This doesn't bother me as there is no reason to believe it is unsafe, but I can see other people just not eating bananas at all (which I think is silly).
I love the guy who has to put his glasses on to taste the candy.
Shit...that's my dream job. Making candy.
This is so relaxing....
I went to order some candy, I was so excited. Until I saw it would cost me $45 to ship to the UK :( I was sad. Maybe one day I'll have the money to order some
You should make taste like a banana foster Sunday
This man surely adores his job!
This video in a nutshell: banana banana banana banana banana banana 🍌 banana 🍌 banana
Official candy of Kagamine Len™
I've never learned that much about candy before
I'm not a big fan of bananas but I loved being in this world for 10 minutes!
This reminds me of Victorian glass makers, who would melt together bundles of colored glass rods and then twist them or embed them in clear glass -- making all sorts of wild designs.
this is my all time favorite channel
a lot off banana xd
I just ordered a couple bags. I'm pretty stoked to get it in and try some.
thanks for making the cutting of the candy longer! love that step!
You've got a lovely speaking voice and the intonation of a raconteur.  I'm sure you pass on a little passion for bananas to all your audiences.
ha!! i were peeling my banana right! take that kindergarten! i am not an idiot!
"we may not have bananas in the future" but it's my favorite fruit!
It's pronounced grow me shell, not gross michel... it's french
"why they use flavors that don't taste like banana's? so as we cut the sugar-" ADHD at it's finest... he got distracted before answering his rhetorical question...
I actually like the artificial taste of banana.
You guys are awesome. I watch a video about banana candy and get a lesson in plant biology and the dangers of monoculture farming.
I heard about this possible extinction of bananas myself, and although I have not looked into it myself, I was also informed that in order to combat this, bananas were being grown in India where the climate is much like it's native habitat. That way if this disease does hit, there would still be a stock of bananas safe from the disease.
i like this its relaxing and infomitive
Is it sad that I have NEVER eaten a Banana split?
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!! This one was super interesting to listen to and watch. Please keep making them <3
We will always have bananas' most likely, as in this world, we have genetic modification, and artificial bullshit.
I don't even like bananas, how the hell did I end up here? xD  But I love candy. So I Subscribe at once!
Try watch this if you hate banana's
I'm actually allergic to bananas. I hate my life
How... How the hell did I get here...?
i want to eat it so badly
I understand that shooting and editing a video is a lot of work and effort, but I think a lot of the viewers would love it if you put the name of the song that's playing in the background on the screen or in the description. Love the videos by the way, the passion behind the content shows.
I learned more from this video than most of my history classes
GMOs will save us
This is so informative and the candy making process is a beautiful thing to watch
Don't know how I ended up here but facts about bananas have never felt more intriguing
Oh someone PLEASE tweet this to Tyler Joseph or Josh Dun 😂
This video is bananas     I'll go die in a hole now bye
@Lofty Pursuits thank you guys so much for inspiring me to make my own hard candy!
I always wondered about these types of candies. Are you supposed to bite down on them or just suckle on them until they are gone?
I don't know why this was in my suggested videos but I'm glad it was.
ARE YOU SATISFIED YOUTUBE? I WATCHED IT!
I'm not particularly fond of bananas, real or fake, but these candies look amazing. I might have to drop by this winter when I have the holidays off.
I'm the kid who dropped the candy before it even landed in his hand x3
Y'all should start a monthly subscription box with a variety of candy
Guys look its a bananvil
are you singing while pulling the candy on the hook.?
i just discovered this channel and im having the time of my life xD
How many times does he say candy?
This doesn't stop being in my recommendations, OK, I'LL SEE IT YOUTUBE, JUST STAPH.
Alrighty, what do you want to name the video? Name it either victorian banana candy or why does banana candy not taste like bananas. -video uploads- I meant name it one of the two...
When u looked at the thumbnail I thought it was a work
why does it look like a maggot? That's no banana to me.,.
Imagine... a world without bananas
I don't know why I was recommended this, but I love it.
anything to get over 10 minutes
A- PEEL GREAT A-PEEL
This is so ooo gooooood
The candies look fairly sharp, they don't hurt kids to eat do they?
Im so glad this was on my recommended
What a wonderful video! I get to watch delicious candy being made (the speed with which he slices those candy pieces really astounded me) AND learn interesting history and facts about bananas!
OK YOUTUBE, ILL WATCH IT
It looks like a worm not a bannana
1891 that's so old wow
such a soothing voice
Oh my gosh this looks so good! I really hope to visit your store one day when I visit America, I'd take the 20 hour drive!
I have a question about the foods/candies you sell: do you guys take care to not cross contaminate with allergens? Most specifically peanuts and tree nuts which can be pretty severe allergies. Just curious! Thanks :) Watching oh guys making candy is so cool by the way!! And all the history is fascinating too ^^
Can you eat the liquid candy? I know it's really hot but is it possible?
"merry go round and...and skyscrapers" what did he say in the middle?
🍌 This video is so satisfying!
Must be a fun job making candy.
How did you lot have a camera to film the creation of the table in 1891?
amazing and in so many ways informative video! this particular method reminds me of the japanese kintaro-candy ^^  subscribed! :)
I just watched a 10 minute video about bananas
from the thumbnail i thought there was somekind of worm in it.
do you guys ship to Europe? I would relly like some banana candy
i had bo clue what you were saying about bananas but i want to eat it
That's a lot of work to put a little banana figure in the candy vs just making yellow banana flavored candy.  At least someone is still an artist.
I like
Not that fond of bananas, but that doesn't matter. This is awesome.
Thanks i learned alot of about bananas
how we make kitkat???
I have to laugh at the end - "We had a problem - our taste-tester was out, so we asked some volunteers if they wanted to try it - they liked it."
I PEEL BANANAS RIGHT! WOOH!
I have always peeled bananas from the flower end. Why would you do it another way? I get a nice handle to hold. I could even peel it one-handed with my teeth if I needed to - and without getting any banana meat on my fingers.
this is lovely
What do you do with scrap bits of candy you cut of during production?
There are Gros Michel bananas in a few tropical places around the world, like the Philippines and Indonesia. I've always wanted to try one because I LOVE that artificial and chemical banana flavor.
I just watched the whole thing. What's gone wrong in my life? Something's gone horribly wrong in my life.    Oh God.
banana republics
These candy making videos are so satisfying
take a shot everytime he says banana lol
i love the unacorin dropins
My mom worked at Chiquita
Anyone know the song the background?
Looks great from the UK... we often have sticks of rock that are long... sometimes these long "stick of rock" as we call them can have writing going through them saying things like the place you purchased it from, like a Beach... where they are most commonly sold. Hope you have come across this type.
Who else died when he missed the kids hand with the candy?😂
I wish I had a bigger reason to visit Tallahassee so I could come to this shop! I'd probably just sit and watch you make candy from beginning to end and then buy a bunch, so it'd be fun :D
made me laugh out loud scaring my cats at the "appeal" joke. i will definitely visit you guys!
Lol my primitive brainthought the thumbnail was a maggot at first
"Public Displays of Confection".. nice :-)
I like this. This is nice.
you shut find some information about that banana companies like chikita they did some nasty stuff in the past
You should take the scraps of different candy batches and mix them together, sell them as "Amalgams"
Was he talking about bananas? I was not paying attention.
Interesting Video, I orderer a bag of this candy. I never liked the artificial flavor of bananas and this looks greats. thanks
Him cutting the candy was really cool
this was a cool video
Do you guys think this video was BANANAS?
bananas are fascinating
Gross Michael!? XD  It's pronounced grow michelle :P
It was kind of mesmerizing when you started cutting the candy.
9:31 OMEGALUL
5:30 Oh god that pun...
lol whats a grose michel? ;)
Why is this recommended for me?
And I like the soft 😥 but it is still good when it is hard
If I eat the soft my mouth will burn
*BANIANIAAA !*
When I first saw the thumbnail, I thought it was a maggot. xD
How long does it take to make one batch? It would be cool to make candy the old fashioned way. What did your candy look like when you've started making candy? 😁😁😁
IS this the same stuff as blackpool rock?
I've been concerned about the cavendish going away for a few years now.  Hope it pulls through, it's my daughters favourite fruit.
I always peel bananas from the end because I can't peel it from the top, it's to hard
am i the only one who thought the thumbnail was a piece of candy with a worm in it?
Very interesting. I've always hated banana flavor candy.
U bananas for bananas 😂
when i eat candies like this they sometimes make my mouth bleed cuz of the sharp edges. anyone else has this problem?
Love this more historical and informational direction these videos have start taking.
this is pretty cool
is that a tiny anvil?     I like the tiny anvil
...says the place that's always OUT of bananas whenever I try to order a banana split! :-/
I wonder if this is the same taste of banana medicine I used to take in the 80's. I loved that artificial banana flavor and I never understood why it tasted so different.
U really like bananas don't u
If you think I'm gonna sit and watch a 10:06 min long video about bananas and candy you're damn right 🔥🍌
I wish I was a banana
everytime he say Banana, you take a drink
I really, really, really like this video.
Wow I totally went to Tallahassee recently. Sucks I didn't know about you guys.
I've learned more about bananas from a 10 minutes video than school and college combined.
Okay I watched it, happy youtube?
I came here for banana candy but now im here for banana history
I can watch this guy churn candy on a hook all day.
Groh Mee-shel
Your candy maker must have sore muscles at the end of the day!
I absolutely LOVE these videos! Thank you for sharing your very interesting process and the history that you provide in them as well.  Long live Lofty Pursuits!
The yellow definitely gives this banana candy a-PEAL! Here he he            I make bad puns I know.
I suggest looking up the history of banana plantations in Guatemala. Also you forgot to mention the term banana republic! Otherwise it was a nicely made video!
awesome! incredibly informative and high quality content
I absolutely hate the flavour of bananas, but thank you for an interesting video anyway. It was nice to get a mini history lesson while watching some hard candy making.
I want some 🍌 candy now
This is the first time I have ever heard anything about the banana industry
I love that I got to watch the candy be made and learn something :D So awesome!
And why do you call them "unicorn droppings"?
fun fact banana emit isotope potassium-40 a safe radiation
And im gonna buy your banana candies when my family get s paid.
This is so pure
i don't like bananas
Your voice is so nice to listen to, you should do podcasts or something
My teeth hurt. Cool video though.
For my Bday I want to ride down to Tallahassee and meet you and the lofty pursuits crew
This vid is pretty cool 10/10 would recommend
*intense candy cutting*
that cover of the fastball song tho
this video came up in every recommended video list on every video I watched and it wasn't even good
I learned a lot about bananas that I didn't know I wanted to know😆
So am I the only one who wants to eat some banana rn?
You had me at "Public Displays of Confection".  I bend the knee to you, King of Puns.
Bananas are definitely my favorite fruit, so it would suck to not be able to eat them in the future :^(
TIL: i've been peeling bananas wrong my whole life.
Casually flips between talking about their product and facts  Then slips in some advertisement A couple puns in there too  Actually was a really good video and didnt find the advertisement at all annoying
As I was watching this and seeing the kids watching I was hoping you would give them freebies, good on you for that it's always nice to see small gestures and even the dad got which was a bonus.
Please make more ones without it sped up. Its very interesting to know a bit of history of things in one candy making video.
This was in my recommended for so long....are you happy youtube?
I don't      Like.      Bananas.    Lol
How tf did I end up here
Sell the banana robs as banana  candy sticks instead of bite sized peices
Might have to save up and make a trip to see you guys sometime ,!
Hey I live in ft laurderdale but I'll ask mom to stop by we're moving to Georgia soon
we can tell you like bananas.
I don't want to loose my bananas  D:
Greg is my senpai
Looks like a fun job
8:00 clink. clink clinkclinkclinkclinkclinkclinkclinkclinkclinkclinkclinkclink
so stimmy
i like this content. good history. good visual asmr
Love the old music in the background. Especially Rockin Robin 10/10
This was so interesting!
This is so satisfying to watch.
How many times did he say banana?
I like banana laughy taffy
Personally... I'm not a big fan of bananas
woah, you cut that fast
this video is bananas
I could listen to this guy all day, this is so cool!
you know, maybe they banana growing companies should just ditch the whole mono-culture model, these days there are tons of different veraties of apples, peaches, tomatoes, what have you in stores rather than just one or two like their used to be, why not add bananas to this change in mentality?
THAT'S why I like banana milkshake, but not actual bananas! I've always thought bananas were tasteless.   I knew about the Gros Michel (which you could at least make an effort to pronounce with a French accent) but that never struck me that "banana" flavouring was just out-dated.
that kid dropping the candy right as the footage cuts out tho
I accidentally clicked this and I just thought it was an ad
8:08 is so satisfying
Couldn't find anything on the site about this, do you do any sugar-free/diabetic-friendly candy?
Nice video, didn't know about the old banana being the artificial flavor. I kinda wanna try one now, I tend to prefer the candy flavor to real... I have one slightly unrelated question. Who did the cover of the last song?
You have such a soothing voice I just had to subscribe. Wonderful informational video and lovely to watch.
Do you ship to Hawaii?
It has now been nearly 3 week since I bought candy from these guys, Either they decided to wait until the winter to ship my candy, or I'm just never going to get it. So ... Yeah.
Wait pulling from the non stem end is The right way? When my mom gave me my first ever banana that's how I peeled it from then on
watching you cut that candy is so satisfying
i wanted to eats the candy trought the screen ... bad thing im all the way in czech republic
iv watched a few of your videos and you always when it is used add your citric acid to the amber candy why is that
noob kid on the left lol , droped candy
God... I wish we had more stores like yours all across America. Its an important part of our culture that i think people miss.
It's herb not erb
Excellent Video Thank You.
One of my best memories is of my brother and I watching the local candy maker make candy. This was 50 some years ago in Long Beach. We would watch him from start to finish through the big glass window and when he was done he would bring each of us a little paper bag full of still warm candy. If I remember right the man's name was Mr. Parks or something like that. Well my brother has since past but I still think about him and I at the candy store.
I'd love to visit your place! Someday ...
I just learned something?
Fortunately there are some other varieties of banana - like the Apple Banana.  I suppose we'd be out of bananas for a while, but it wouldn't be the END OF ALL BANANAS if the Cavendish gets taken down.
I can't really hear the guy talking, just hypnotized by the candy making
I just bought the candy
i think it looks like a pokeball
I come here because you guys are the only place in tally with sprechers root beer.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate this style of restaurant.  Im happy you are doing good. :)
Droppin the poor kids piece at 9:31
what an informative video, think you guys also did the black currant candy video? its great when you enjoy yourself watching a video and also learn random facts
I ALWAYS peel bananas from the bottom, it's just easier
Gros Michel pronounced "Grow Mi-shell"
I want to work in a candy shop now
If there's a reason I go to Florida, it's because of Lofty Pursuits
How did you get to taste an actual gros michael banana???
Huh, I've never thought that bananas can be this fascinating
the real question is why don't bananas taste like banana candies anymore?
This was more relaxing than I thought.
The "gross michael"... lol, its the gros michel, french.
I thought the same about any strawberry candy; that it never seems to taste like biting into a fresh strawberry.
THANK YOU FOR THE HISTORY OF BANANAS
It is actually prodounced "Grow mish-el" and "kah-vend-ish"
8:02 is that sped up? if not you deserve a thumbs up
There are things the romans ate that are practically extinct too...so it could definitely happen
Stop calling me gross >:(
watching the guy chop the candy was soooooo satisfying.
I have learned so many things about bananas today. What can I do with this information? Someone please tell me!
gros-michel is pronounced "Grow-Mish-elle" not "Gross Michael." It's french
That kid at the end's face when he drops the candy, lol.
These videos are so damn relaxing.... If I ever come to Florida, I'll definitely stop on by. :)
Plátano
LET ME TELL YOU BUDDY... The bananas wrapped in ham with hollandaise sauce that you alluded to in this video? It's strangely delicious. It's almost like a creamier sweet potato, and while the flavor doesn't mesh with ham flawlessly it certainly is unique and worth trying.  On that note my wife hates it so... not saying you're going to love it.
Bananas with meat? That doesn't sound that strange. I've eaten a Filipino barbecue sauce, it contained banana; peppers; brown sugar; onion; garlic; and smoked tomatoes. It was really good.
This video just randomly showed up on my recommendations, and I'm not even mad. Totally eye pleasing and very informative. Subscribed.
Suicidal drink game: Take a shot every time he says "bananas".
In England this type is usually sold in long sticks (usually about 6 inches) and is called  'rock'. The city of Blackpool is famous for its 'Blackpool rock' and is a massive business where you can find many things written into the stick like you have the banana there
This guy gives a real nice vibe off i like em
great video , so much information, I loved it!
I wish you did sell the unicorn droppings online - i am in canada and we don't get to travel there. :(
This is such a well-made video
I wanna visit you guys someday on one of my trips to Florida!
That is a professional chopper right there!
how did i get to this video i hate bananas 😂😂 it was cool seeing how the candy was made tho
Gros Michel. -Grow me shell. Not gross Micheal.
can you do a video on how you guys make the molten candy and kinda teach everyone what you guys do to make this stuff, its actually really neat to see the finished products like the rose bud candy you guys did, you don't have to do this but it would be cool if you did
I like this guy
Such interesting banana info, foam bananas are yummy 😋
As a brasilian i find it funny when people talk about bananas, i once was talking to a Canadian friend and he was talking about how only there were 3 types of bananas, while i had literally 4 types just inside my house. xD
I live in Latrobe, PA, where the banana split was invented :^)
Watching you cut that candy is so satisfying  😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
i actually like the old banana flavored candy, which is weird because i dont like bananas.
Industry mono culture is killing biological diversity and putting everyone at risk
thats a very cool art :)
Looks like tiny shrimp in it tbh
Mmmmmm.... BANANA🤤 Do you ever sell the product in whole sticks before cutting it?
What is the texture like? It looks to be similar to Rock (UK, not US Rock Candy) (sometimes called Brighton Rock). Looks to be made the same also, Im guessing anyway.
Take a shot every time he says candy. Good luck.
I'm sure we'll still have bananas in the future XD The main kind of banana went out of style, and a new one took its place. It'll likely happen again.
5:30 I almost missed that joke. lol
I thought that was a maggot on the candy....
These are the best videos on YouTube
Uploaded on the day I bought my first batch, still waiting for it to arrive. :)
aho girl is the master of bananas
Are all your candies sweat or are some sour as well? If you don't make sour candies is there a reason? I would love to eat some sour candy. If you decide to make some I would order some sour candy.
gros michel is pronounced like "Grow Mi shell" not like "Gross Micheal"
I hope they post on my birthday :D (august 17th) it always lightens the mood when videos are posted in my birthday.
The yellow gives it a peel? BOOOOOOO!!!
when i was younger i wanted to own my own candy shop, later on I had to make a business plan in an entrepreneurship class. Turns out I wouldn't make a very good business man.
At 9:30 the kid drops the banana candy. Thank for the history lesson!
Doesn't lint from the gloves get in the candy?
8:19 Woah! So prefect!
There is no right way to peel a banana 🤥
I just ordered a bunch of candy and now there's one more I want to try.
It's 12 AM, and I now want to visit Tallahassee.
Him:And why it doesn't taste like bananas....I already added the banana flavoring  Me:......wait
Wouldn't an aluminium table be more able to disperse heat, and be cleaner
I suddenly want some hard candy.
this is a lot more interesting then i thought it would be
It's too bad Ray Comfort didn't know all these banana facts before making his infamous video.
Watching you cut that candy was very oddly satisfying. Keep up the great work!
Have you ever thought of making Damascus candy? ie candy that looks like Damascus steel.  There are some really fantastic Damascus steel makers on You Tube; one of my favourites is Alec Steele's channel 😊👍
How much do the unicorn droppings cost?
Im allergic to bannanas
This video is totally bananas
9:31 Poor kid thought he was gonna get some candy, but then gravity interfered and Little Boy went without. What a tragedy.
I really like the diagrams showing the cross section of the candy. Makes it easier to visualize.
....I never ever thought I'd come to learn so much about bananas.... thank you? I guess. But anyway, the video was nice like always👌🏽🍌
The banana looks like a tequila worm. New candy flavor? 💛
I've always peeled bananas upside down just cuz it never smushed the banana
It was so satisfying when he was cutting the candy in pieces 😨
I thought the little banana in the center of the candy was a worm hah
I'm pretty sure the banana industry(what a strange phrase) has contingencies for such a monoculture die-off by now. We might just end up having another slightly un-banana-tasting banana in the future.
I thought i was a worm in the thumbnail
I've never had an actual banana split
Do you have dreams about making candy
just watching this video gave me type 3 diabeetus... Still a great video !  edit: damn was I dat rude back then?
If monkeys do it, how can it be wrong? I'm laughing so hard, cause they throw their poop at people too, and that's very wrong. 😂😬 love your vids!
Victorian banana candy but every time he says banana the video gets faster
The dark filling looks like a grub or maggot.
"I'm not sure if that story is true or not, but it is a banana story, so I'm gonna stick with it." -HA! Also liked the appealing joke. Well done!
I once had a banana that tasted the same as the soft banana candy! It was amaaazing haha.
my life is a lie bananas are herbs strawberries aren't berries and they're related to roses cashews are seeds
Humans are the ultimate creator of disease. We are overpopulated and killing everything.
I like the artifical banana flavor. That's pretty cool, I'll have to try that banana.
🌟 *-STONED-* 💓 Great Video
This legend of the Gros Michel being the true inspiration of artificial banana flavor is nonsense. When artificial flavors were being developed, they needed names that people would recognize. This is the reason why practically none of the fruit flavors taste like the real thing. Does artificial grape taste like real grape? What about apple or watermelon?  There are hundreds of varieties of some fruits, and just as many extinct or rare varieties. This doesn't mean that any of the artificial flavors are based on something lost to history. They were just given marketable names after they were developed.
I thought it was a worm in the middle of the candy
Do you use LorAnn for you banana? If not, who do you use? Looking for a REAL banana instead of the candy/medicine ones.
Thanks for the history as you make the candy, I think I actaully like the history more than the candy making, but the combination is fantastic!
Who's the one singing?
I feel I'm the only one who thinks banana sweets do taste like bananas.
I'm off to work in 6 minutes, and here I am getting lectured about the history of bananas and candy.
Did the book teach you how to defend yourself against an assailant armed with a banana?
The way he said they liked it at the end was funny
Did anyone count how many times he sayed "banana" !!!!
WHAT!! IS THAT SONG IN THE BACKGROUND AT THE END!? AT AROUND 9:10 !!!???? WHO DID THAT COVER I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND IT FOR MONTHS.
I'm still dying at the candy that fell out of the kids hand at the end
I HAVE THE MACHINE TO DO THAT MORE FAST !!!
Wow, i wanna banana candies
"It would be a much sadder place if the world did not have banana splits."  Truer words have never been spoken.
"Who's a better expert at bananas" ... my girlfriend ;)
2:14 did u add those images to block out that guy lol
The next banana I consume I'll peel it that way. No one likes the strands.
It's pronounced gro Mishele
You guys should sell uncut rods of candy.
Your explanation for the flavoring isn't right. The answer is much simpler: The flavor of real bananas is made up of thousands of different compounds, something that is very expensive to mimic closely. Artificial banana flavor is a single compound: isoamyl acetate. And that's extremely cheap to make. Since its "close enough", and better flavors disproportionally more expensive, the cheap stuff is basically the norm. Gros Michel just happens to be higher in isoamyl acetate than the cavendish.
Am I the only one who thought that the song in the background at 9:07 sounded like the song "bad things" sung by Camila Cabello??
How the hell did I even get here?
9:31 my favorite part of the video when the kids doesn't get his candy.
I love these videos Just so nice to just chill and watch them
I just ate that candy!
Next time I come to Florida I am definitely checking these banana candies out!
Sugarcane is the most planted crop in the world IIRC
So it tastes like non banana ?
I don't even like bananas, why am I watching this
i wouldnt cut it like that but that's me
Or how I learned to stop worrying and love the rock
100% has a banana fetish
Is anyone else bothered that the banana isn't in the middle
6:00  Expert scissor throwing
Anyone else here develop a banana allergy? :(
Great eye candy and great info. Luv it
SAVE THE BANANA PLEASE
Zen
So there was a banana apocalypse that I was unaware of until today. Alrighty then.
I thought it was pronounced "Grow Michelle (grois Michel) and cavenDISH"
The banana looks like a slug or parasite
The part where he's slicing it is so satisfying to watch
Honestly when I watch these videos it makes me crave both candy and the food they're making the candy out of. Luckily for me, I have a few ripe bananas laying around. Tasty.
i am glad you talked about the general history of the gros michel, it's rather interesting and a warning for reckless imbreeding
I learned alot about bananas from this! The only one i knew was the banana candy tasting like Gros michel.   Also that rock candy looks SO GOOD
Does anybody else care how a banana is peeled
Who wants to do an arm wrestling contest with this guy I certainly don't All that candy gave him muscles
wow didn't expect that much knowledge coming from a candy making video. nice one, lads
If I ever go to America, I'm going to do a pilgrimage to your store. And I'll pay you money if you'll let me watch you, or work the cashier for free or something.
I like that this video gives you an insight of the world's food production problems on top of explaining their ways of making their candy.
the cutting speed damn
the wholesome side of youtube
I have Gros Michel banana plant in my backyard. I bought it from amazon.
I really liked this! thank you for teaching us :)
People peel bananas by the stems?
Visiting your store and watching you make candy and of course eating is one of the things in my bucket list
Just saw another reason why I should visit the states again ^^
we should genetically modify bananas to have seeds?
a moment of silence for the kid's candy piece that fell at 9:30
Why do "Circus Peanuts" taste like bananas ?
Is this also why grape candy doesn't taste like grapes?
Love watching your videos and the history my neice and I learn while watching
I always wondered why banana flavor seems to taste nothing like a real banana (to me, at least.) Now I know. Thanks for the education, as always! :D
It looks like a little maggot in a candy
very beautiful bananas! 😍😉
Do you sell those rods full?
Subs at 8:55
I was in Tallahassee last month and wasn't able to visit, hopefully I can visit someday!
question, have you ever hit your rist on the hook? id realy like to know
Because we only have the cavashan banana not the other due to diseases
I used to make this candy in Orlando. We made the banana but it wasn't that popular. Alligator Poo was the most popular candy and the cashew brittle would be sold out before we even got it off the table.
Lol even the staff is infatuated with the candy pulling; he can't stop staring.
I don't think it's very nice trying to scare children into thinking bananas will disappear  🍌
Love this Greg!!
I love the mini history lessons! Always blows my mind!
you know when your pulling the candy on that hook thing is it hard for you to stretch the candy out on that hook like is it sore for your arms and hands?
And now I want a banana
This is oddly satisfying =D
Is this about the grow michelle banana taste instead of an cavendish?
I found this by random and enjoyed myself
I always love to see the process of how things are made. In particular candy because most of the equipment and techniques are completely unchanged from such a long time ago.
The trilateral symmetry of the banana is actually due to chromosomal triploidy; the banana plant has three sets of every chromosome, whereas in nature it would generally have just two, like us. This is also what renders bananas infertile, and prevents their seeds from developing. In nature, a triploid banana plant would be sterile, a genetic dead end, but human intervention seized what would have been a fatal genetic error and turned it into a huge advantage. Now there are many times more triploid bananas than there are diploid.
Watching hard candy making is so soothing and relaxing for me... I don't know why...
Hay, I live in Florida!
Have you ever had anyone jist want the big log as a whole? Lol
I was wondering what you did with the ends! You should show a video with some of the unicorn droppings lol
americans pronouncing french words will always bother me especially when their pronouciation is correct for their dialect so I'm technically wrong but I will always pronounce Illinois as ill-len-wah and not ill-len-oish
"Public displays of confection"? You win.
I have never tasted one of those candy's before but that looks so good.
I came across your channel as a recommendation on my side bar. So glad I watched..I've seen several now. I love all the history you give us and your integrity to your art and the old ways. Yes, art, because you, sir, are a true artist and craftsman and your dedication is wonderful in this day and age of "Give it to me now, I don't want to wait". I live in Maine and due to health problems I could never make such a long trip to see you work in person, but I wish you continued success always. You are fantastic..thank you for sharing with us all!
I'm going bananas !!
Why don't you use a mechain to roll out the candy
What made you decide to go from being an artist to a candy maker?
Great history lesson! I'm going to use it for my bio class tomorrow - I'm teaching them about mitosis vs meiosis and the importance of variation/why it's bad to be a clone!
lmao i always loved artificial banana flavoring
nice video , did you also knew that bandannas have the highest natural radiation from all the fruits !  it's because a banana contains potassium. ( you body needs this to grow , ! so there not dangerous )
Love watching these videos. Wish i could come and visit but I live in Australia :(
Even though they get a bad rap, this is why I like scientests messing with food (my brain farted on the term). If they did not mess with the banana DNA, we would have no bananas. I know there was a Banana War but I don't know enough about it to make a detailed comment.
I get so happy when I see these videos 💛💛
The kid at 9:31 dropped the piece of candy
I've been wondering, why don't you all create a patreon to help expand the business?
did the world learn nothing from the monocoltures after the great potato famine literally the exact same thing happened
#SAVETHEBANANAS
Whenever I peel it from the "correct" end, the stringy things still stay on the banana :/
For some reason I'm allergic to most fruits and vegetables (including bananas), when I eat them, I feel an annoying itching on my tongue. The only  fruits that don't make me feel that are apples, pears, oranges, grapefruits, avocados and all kinds of corn (except for yellow sweet corn)
Your videos make me so unimaginably happy
I love learning new things while watching people make candy
Most don't care to know, but the strands have a lot of nutrients. Same with the white strands in oranges.
How fast can you separate pieces from pieces it's so mesmerizing.
Love bananas but hate banana flavored things! I always thought I was weird but noe I know why :)
Nice Job including the facts about banana flavour! Not alot of people know that!
I don't eat bananas as they are as I used to, likely because that are just too... bland. I had local bananas, gros michel, and cavendish. I prefer wrapped fried bananas coated in brown sugar, though...
I come for the candy, but I stay for the history lesson.
I just made a 1am Tardis candy impulse purchase. I have no regrets.
Please please tell me who's doing the covers? I so curious.
awh... i love this background music so much. its so... quaint. and perfect for banana education.
I want him as my grandpa mine just brings home women this guy tells stories and makes candy and has a cool hat
Save the bananas!! :(
Looks delicious! My candy order should arrive soon and I can't wait! I have a question for you. Why do you pull by hand instead of with a machine? Thank you for making such great candies and videos!
The 'appeal' pun actually made me clap aloud. Well done, sir.
I've never had a banana split..
I have been patiently awaiting  the arrival of your videos.. I just love watching you fold roll and cut the candy..  It is so relaxing so thank you and keep them coming!!
You uploaded on my birthday lol 🤣I hate Bananas but i like some of the artificial flavors lol
I learn like 10 (non-candy) new things every time I watch your videos :D love it
this is making me want to go to florida more and more,
I love watching these candy videos, it's actually my dream to make candy
You are just so sweet!
Super interesting banana history!
I just watched Greg violate a banana.
We visited exactly one week ago on my birthday and also on our way home to North Georgia. I got a variety pack and I must say that banana and peach were my favorite ones! I definitely reccommend it! Loved stopping by!
I can't stand 90% of artificial banana flavored things.. So this was really fun to learn the reason why! Love your videos!
I think this is the prettiest candy I've seen of y'alls so far <3 I love all the yellow!
I also feel like we don't look into our own history enough. Which is why I have to correct you here. The Gros Michel is not likely to be that actual inspiration for the artificial banana flavour in candy, but rather a guess made in hindsight that isn't verifiable, but still makes the rounds as a popular misconception, probably persisting because people who seem to be speaking from authority might pass the misinformation on to large audiences. It's highly unlikely that the first people to bottle banana essence (which, in 1853, predates the popularity of the Gros Michel by a number of decades anyway) were trying to mimic a specific cultivar, especially because it was usually a single compound, isoamyl acetate, a chemical byproduct of alcohol distillation that is actually found in bananas. The fact that it tastes more like Cavendish than Gros Michel is more likely to be happenstance than anything.
I've been peeling it from the flower end for years and people think I'm nuts. I keep trying to tell them it's the correct way.
Love your videos! Also, your voice calms down my cat :) Greetings from Venezuela!
i looooooove ur vids!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great info on bananas! My in laws and hubby love bananas. They eat one to two a day. Bananas  don't  last long in this  house. Lol
We ordered candy a bit ago. My favorite was the blueberry. I didn't get much. My ten year old ate most of it.
awesome video.  We can't get people to believe in climate change, so i'm not sure we will get them to worry about bananas going extinct :).Cheers from PEI Canada, Bryan
Grape flavor is the same. Very fake taste doesn't actually taste like grapes
Love this channel so informative
I like the illustrations you added during the modeling of the bananas. It really helps to visualize what each step contributes to the shape of the candy. Something like this would be cool to see throughout the video. Maybe an idea for future candy making projects! Thanks for the awesome video, the candies look great!
I was just researching this the other day. How topical.
Make candy with the stone mask from Jojo's Bizzare Adventure that will be fun e.e
The kid at the end dropped his piece. Lol
I would like your videos without the background music I miss hearing you speak while making the candy
You know, it really is a shame I'm allergic to bananas
I really liked this. I can tell you did your research! The diagrams were nice too. ❤️
I love these videos
How punny!Great aPEAL
Something similar is happening to the Cavendish. I have ice cream bananas and I'm getting manzano or apple banana.
I'm buying some candy soon. I'm all the way in Australia so I have to wait awhile for the cheaper shipping option haha. I'm coming to America and I hope I can detour and come in store.
pronounced 'grow' not 'gross' .  Great vid though
Awesome!
I love ur voice! its nice to hear u explain the history and interesting fact about each flavor like this banana video or the lilac one. keep narrorating. I just want to keep listening to interesting fact. also if u could leave a list of the music list playing in the background. I love the music as well. Thank you!
Watching this while eating a banana. 🍌 🙂
For some reason your videos never fail to bring a smile to my face.Thank you.
I love ur vids wish there was more
I love this chanel the videos are relaxing and i get to learn new things
Please go back to the jazz music.
You sure do know a lot about bananas!
the cool thing about this channel is you get to watch candy be made, and you get to learn some interesting facts/history in every episode. i wish you were located near me!
I really love your videos, because i think it's so interesting  to see how you make the candy. And i  love how you also tell some facts and  talk about the topic a little more. That shows that you are very  passionat about what u do:)
Maybe make the banana larger next time.  It looks a bit like a worm
love your vids
Do yaou make soft candy?
I love your stories and facts, they make watching these videos even more fun!
I feel like I need to go enjoy a banana split. I don't eat bananas as often as use to! Thanks for sharing some neat history Greg 🙂
This video was bananas
to bad i cant buy scraps left over from candy designs i would love to buy a mystery bag of left over candy flavors  in drops or rods i know your candy is the best Greg and u some times have left over candy this i just a suggestion to sell left over candy u got
Trilaterally symmetrical or radially symmetrical?
"Gross Michael"  It was a French name, Gros Michel. As such, it's pronounced "grow Michelle".
I just got my wisdom teeth out and this is more soothing than Vicodin
You can just pinch the flowering ends and then pull apart - without using the knife.
Ive noticed in the most recent videos your hook has changed and it no longer sticks?  Is this one seasoned or different somehow, other hten its older?
I thought the thumbnail was an apple or grape with a maggot in it. I'm sorry.
I've been peeling bananas wrong? My whole life is a lie.
noooOOOO! NOT THE BANANAAAAAS!
I have a question. I know you make hard candy (I love going to see it made), But have you ever considered making gummy candy?
I always thought he sounded like eric werinhemniger
In Brazil we have at least fifty different kinds of banana, so relax we are not gonna run out of them! All banana splits are saved
This made me crave hananas
I really want to make the 2.5 hr drive to tally just to watch you make candy. If I called, would you be able to tell me when you're planning on making candy? So I could take a little trip?
Did I click on this video to learn how to make banana image candy? No. Did I click on this video to listen to this man's silky smooth voice talking about the history of bananas? Maybe...
Your videos are getting better and better. I liked the 'what's going on shape-wise while it's melting' info in the upper right hand. Also, the history lesson is welcome. This channel is severely under appreciated!
I love bananas!
This is so satisfying, I wish I could see it in person I was scrolling through the website but you guys don't ship to Brazil 😭
That's adorable!!!!!!!
And I just bought some candies from you, I should've waited to get the banana candy
What a great video, IMHO one of your best! As usual loved the candy creating and this time with bonus banana facts, what could be better. TIL the right way to peel a banana. Thanks and keep up the good work.
I won't want to live in a world without bananas.
Waaallkaa walka
How about some cool image candy with strawberry-basil flavour? I love this combination but have never seen candy, let alone image candy with it.
Why don't you ware hair nets because what if a piece of hair falls in the candy
Greg you have so many stories and interesting facts. Have you ever thought about making a podcast? I find you voice relaxing and I would love to her more of your stories
Each like is a prayer for the piece of candy that fell out of the boy's hand at the end.
I love this channel
Every time he says banana take a drink
I've always wondered about the unusual taste for banana flavored candies. It's kinda cool that, in reality, it DOES in fact taste like a banana. XD
In ordered banana candy and others and I can't wait for it!!
I live in canton GA I have a gold chance of coming there soon!
I come for the candy and stay for the history lesson
I'm going to eat some of this candy but I'm not ordering it I want to visit
5:35 *groan*
Wonderful watching you work! And thanks so much for all the historical and botanical knowledge about bananas.
You can surely bamboozle someone by making banana candy taste like peppermint or fireball
my great grandfather worked for Chiquita and was the guy who figured out you could ship Bananas when they were green it caused the price of them to drop and as a result, my grandmother had a bodyguard till she was 21 (alot of rich ppl were super mad at him)
must be nice to stretch your image with your hands lol I'm a glass blower so we work on the end of a rod.
Has anyone ever critiqued a piece of candy? Or do they just gobble it down?
I have always wondered why banana flavoured items don't taste like bananas, and now I know. Thank you!
lol there is only one dislike
Great Video and Lesson         8)
I love these videos
Rockin Robbin. Good choice of song
I always love your videos. I was wondering do you sell sticks of rock like we have in the UK?
Such high production value for making candy! And good ice cream to boot! I love it! Keep up the amazing work Lofty
History in candy form! I love it!! 😃😍
I love these.
This looks like an amazing place to work
Dang, that was actually very interesting too!
video is satisfying
Thank you for including the sound on the final step of cutting the pieces at the end. I've always been curious to hear what that sounds like. Gotta get me a bag of your currant candy!
I'm glad that you use natural flavors. Unfortunately, I am allergic to banana, so I will not be eating this particular candy. Still looks yummy.
I love banana fritters.. but made from musa paradisica - a variety popular in tropics. It's sweeter and more yellow, and gives a nice gooey texture (like caramel) when you make fritters with them. All this banana talk reminds me of the minions.. wonder if you can make minion candy (without getting into trouble with Pixar of course). It would need many layers of different colored candy I guess.
I wonder if in the process of rolling the candy, the entire roll of candy ever fell off the table? Would suck
Now before i watch this vid i already know that banana flavored candy does taste like bananas but a certain variety that dont exsist no more its called the gros michel banana its extinct.
Ok Greg, I hate banana candy.  It makes me gag.  It tastes so fake and chemical to me.  If you are sure yours are different I will have to try it.  I love real bananas.
i learnt abt the extinction of our previous generation of banana extinction in ap enviro, its crazy tht our parents grew up eating a whole different kind of banana
I got some of these in my image candy mix.  I haaaaate real bananas but these were good!  They were kinda like Runts banana candy, but a more intense and interesting flavor.
I liked the little diagram lol
u best
A blistering hot swimming pool XD
am i the only one who want to eat the candy when its still soft?    holy hell, what did i do to deserve all these likes lol
Just out of curiosity, but can you give me a range for how much it would cost to have custom candy made? I understand that there may be factors that impact the final cost, but a range of price would be nice. Thanks
Thanks for another video Greg, as well as the diagrams on the side to show us what it looks like as it forms!
I think I've watched your videos at least 3 times each. I adore the passion you can hear in your voice when you talk.
BAD PUN ALERT!
I'm definitely buying some of this candy next month! I live in the UK, I wish I was able to come see you guys
Lofty is one of the most well known best candu maker. Can this comment get 1k likes
Thinking would you be able to make emoji candies like a party favour Yellow: lemon  Black: Blackcurrant ( I know there purple) Red: strawberry
I feel like you haven't posted in ages... might just be that I've been craving your videos more lately!
I love these videos. So interesting and informative!
Thought it was bacon
im kinda early yey ! i hope to buy some of your products, you should make candy floss flavored candy!
I wonder if they ever look at that initial cut end, decide it's not good enough and then scrap the lot. I doubt it happens to Greg. But I can see it with new employees
This episode is ... bananas! :D
I wish I could come to Tallahassee, but I live in Indiana, the most boring state ever. That being said, I am checking out your website. I haven't had candy in such a long time.
I wish I lived in the states, I'd buy out all your unicorn droppings!! Ahaha
Yes new vid I love all of them
Great video as always! These informative vids are so soothing to watch!
Did the poor kid at 9:31 get another piece?
this makes me sad to live in denmark cause i cant come and see it in person Dx
mm.. it looks so yummy! I love these videos so much <3
I've never heard gros michel pronounced that way. I've always heard it pronounced 'groh mee-SHELL.' Sorry, couldn't resist. ;)
Is/Was it easy to learn how cut the hard rods on that anvil thing?
"I always thought the yellow wrap was what gave our banana candy it's apPEEL" Please tell me you said that on purpose.
🍌 Like if you like bananas 🍌
Love your voice! Nice and sweet, and very informative
Great video....I don't like bananas but I like banana candy
Hi, do you ship to Sydney Australia??
don't forget all the slavery!!! lots and lots of slavery....humans suck
"gives it its great appeal" *badum-tss*
I highly recommend buying some PD banana candy.  I shared a package with my co-workers and we love it.
Hello! I find these videos entertaining and educational, so that's why I'm subscribing 😁
Re: peeling backwards: I've never had a problem with banana stings, so peeling from the stem still makes more sense because it provides a convenient handle. I honestly don't see what the big deal is with the strings.
I'd totally buy this if you put it online! Love your channel and I love watching you grow!
Keep it up and are you still planning on doing fudge
early squad where you at?
Love ur videos
So scary to learn that bananas can go extinct. Now I have to eat as many as I can haha. However I love artificial banana flavour. Great video! Hope I can order some soon
I love watching your videos and they're so educational! I'm not too fond of banana candy, maybe this is why, that I prefer the Cavendish flavour over the Grosse Michael-style artificial flavour? Why don't we have different types of bananas saved in seed banks like we do apples, pears and other fruits?
I love this channel
I wish i could come see u work ur magic in person!! I live in regina saskatchewan .. So i doubt itll ever happen hahahaha im gonna check out ur wedsite..  U should make a maple flavored canadian flag candy hahahaha ill buy it!!!
Apeel..... heheheheheheheheheheheh
I like the visuals you included to indicate the shapes you were making
Love this channel
Thankyou so much for posting a new video!!! I have been dying for more from you guys you do an amazing job!
Nice to have you back lofty
Notification Squad! Love your videos!
yoyoyoyoyoyoyo
Great video!! I really liked the diagram in the top right-hand corner. I feel like it really helped with understanding the building of the candy. The pun in there was pretty appealing too.
This was really interesting! I'd heard somewhere about why the flavour was like that but I'd forgotten, and the symmetry is wild they're such odd plants
