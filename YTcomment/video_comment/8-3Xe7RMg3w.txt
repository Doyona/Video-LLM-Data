One question, Whats the Exactly name of that candy? Or the name most popular?
How Can i get your number
Hi Could you tell us please what is the temprature of your table where you twist or roll the batch.?
Can you do a red panda please 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Literally how do you expect me to make this at home?
Lot of respect for candy making. 🍬  wow now with every sweet I will have respect.
i always come back to this channel to watch the same hard candy vids 😭
I just got one of those candy's
Guys, what kind of table do you have? Is it heated? What material?
Very clever.
What is orange sheet called?
store closed
كم إستعملت من السكر ؟؟؟!!
i takeded the pear...  the Panda is native to Japan! but yes now watched over by China who has the resource and finances to be able, they Pandas will be able to eat something else than bamboo, it's crazy times, but just give it some more time  (unfortunately me is still stuck in 'this looney story' of attacks in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza, and much worse stuff really not even wars, ya, me knows me have no leeway with time like lucky snuggly Pandas)  (do they accept Great Pyrenees doggys in Indonesia? maybe but surely not me, what about?....)  so ya, got some dogs, maybe next sheep? goats.. this story is getting kinda Abrahamic?! Russians converted to Christianity?? anyways me think the Russians, the Saudis, the Yemenis, and some others, including the Americans! can salvage this creepy childrens' story for a little while at least.... dates and figs are yummy
❤
"How to make," or "how we make."  There's a big difference.
这些化合物的组成是什么？油、染料……？ ？ ？谁知道 ？
Cancer causing colours😢
That's amazing! But I wish they would have kept the black color, black instead of pulling it out and making it gray.
What amazes me the most is how they know how long to make the design so it looks right after stretching.
🐼🍬✨💝👏👏👏
Who else has watched this video 7 years ago liked it, then found it again randomly
I love your work❤❤
My favorite animal❤
Guys I remember that

I Want 3.89 Million Likes🥺
Imagine all the arm hairs and scabs that find their way into that candy as he’s pulling it.
NOT wearing a MASK!!
add a gallon of white ✔
It’s cool how the image doesn’t get distorted when the stretch it
Q gracinha,quanta criatividade e talento! Parabéns.
可愛いです🐼✨ とても楽しく見させていただきました🥰
I agree, you are an artisan-artist.... I Can Say : a master-artisan-artist !
Heads Out
Sugar candy 🍭 has been an integral part of every cultural since ages...across the world 🌎❤from India

Nice pandas cookies

Wow
Where is this?
Unos genios!!! Saludos de argentina!!!!
I love watching rock candy being made...the little pictures are so cute, and the sheen that the candy gets from the taffy pull is amazing.
Can you share me material
i remember watching this video  around five years ago
its 1 at night and im starving
Lately I've been realizing that I'd want a nice trade as a job, so that then I'd have some home time to dedicate to other of my passions. I've been watching these candy making videos a lot for the past two weeks and it's something I'd really like to try. It is honest and dedicated work with a nice and cute touch of creativity as I like. I just wouldn't know where to start with this, even if at home, or how expensive all of the ingredients could be 🤔🙃
Boa tarde, tá tudo muito lindo mas vcs só se esqueceram de nós passar os ingredientes. como faremos essa bala? Ñ nos passou a receita ok!
https://youtu.be/C31xyvhB-1s
What's your website
too much acid come on with it
I like to watch these at 2x speed
good fucking job holy shit humans are tuff
Parabéns
super work😋👍
Vegan candy awesome
Finally I now know how to get the details to be the same when it’s small! 17:14
PANDA
Finnaly i really see how thsy doing it but still seems dificult for me
They nailed the Panda image. Impressive work
Este trabajo no es para débiles. Excelente forma de trabajar el azúcar congratulaciones.
Love it !
Cool idea
SO COOL and looks real yummy☺️😋
Many thanks for sharing these tutorial video 🙏
Badly hello 👋 hello hello hi hello hello hello hello
How are u not tempted to eat that
where can i buy those? My Daughter would realy love to get some and i would be happy as well.^^
I can't imagine the trial and error and sugar used to make this look right.  The employess probably had a lot of misshappen pandas to take home.
This is great at 2x speed
The only flavours that the candy has are the malic acid and sugar? Nothing more? So they allways taste the same?
At least put on a mask when you are talking while handling the candy.
It’s funny that rock candy was invented in Britain but is now being made worldwide.
I wonder how much spit they managed to work into the sugar. Why they don’t wear a mask 😷🤢
its so similar to glass making but instead of melting grains of sand it is grains of sugar!
A little color goes a long way. Less is more.
the candy dimension
I hope there is a free step by step course for me to do it my own business here in Philippines.
Finally, one that isn't in Korean lol Also are you from France ? Because the words on your apron are in french
Such a great candy video. I love it so much.
Conozco alguien que si se la comería a esa paleta gigante soy Juana 😝🧏
WOW
o doce e gostoso mais o dificil e em tender o que ele diz
Oh! So this is how cancer looks like. I always wandered.. disgusting food.. if you can even call it food
I keep going oohhhhhh aaaahhhhhhhh
I didn't even realize the video was 19 minutes long, It was so relaxing and entertaining to watch. Good One!
Am I the only one who actually search for this video? I always wondered how they make so tiny details in such a small candy. Now I know it started gigantic and is just made smaller 😅
That's pretty cool!
HOW THE HECK CAN YOU DO THAT AT HOME? ARE THEY KIDDING!
Woah
The shrinking part at the end was amazing!
I love you so much my  friends  😘
Wait what acid?
wonder what itll look like if u cut it when its a big roll…
*unchained melody plays*
Y’all get a great workout doing that! I want to do that sooo bad!!!! So amazing to me!
I watched this on mute with Hitman Blood Money's soundtrack "Apocalypse" in another tab. It was F-ing epic!
the OG hard candy video
I know its hot and all but the candy looks way tastier while its gooey
أيام على رمضان...ف اشتركي الآن قبل فوااااااااااات الأواااااان الآاااااااااااااان https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HohqtA2C1aI

Very tasty!!! 🤤🤤🤤

Candy
Must take a long time to master this process, they do it so well.  Amazon, car hop trays.
How is it that they make that REALLY big candy panda so small!!👍
heavy-duty candy making videos are my favorite
all the people here are probably confused af to why there is Interface merch recomended here.
In the beginning of the video, I wondered why they would share their techniques to the general public. After watching, I realized it was to discourage anyone else in trying to become a competitor. 😅
If you died or the world ended today, are you certain that you would go to Heaven? "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16 KJV  We are all sinners who deserve to spend eternity in Hell. "For all have sinned,  and come short of the glory of God;" Romans 3:23 KJV "For the wages of sin is death*[this means both physical death (Romans 5:12 KJV) and the death of one's soul (Revelation 21:8 KJV)]*; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Romans 6:23 KJV. "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." Romans 10:9 KJV Salvation is eternal, and through faith; God does not take back the gift of salvation after you receive it. "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one." -John 10:27-30 KJB. Ephesians 2:8-9 KJB says, "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."     Si vous mouriez ou si le monde prenait fin aujourd'hui, êtes-vous certain que vous iriez au paradis ? "Car Dieu a tant aimé le monde qu'il a donné son Fils unique, afin que quiconque croit en lui ne périsse pas, mais qu'il ait la vie éternelle." Jean 3:16 LSG Nous sommes tous des pécheurs qui méritons de passer l'éternité en enfer. « Car tous ont péché et sont privés de la gloire de Dieu » ; Romains 3:23 LSG "Car le salaire du péché, c'est la mort * [cela signifie à la fois la mort physique (Romains 5: 12 LSG) et la mort de son âme (Apocalypse 21: 8 LSG)] *; mais le don de Dieu est éternel la vie par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur." Romains 6:23 KJV. "Que si tu confesses de ta bouche le Seigneur Jésus, et que tu croies dans ton cœur que Dieu l'a ressuscité des morts, tu seras sauvé." Romains 10:9 LSG Le salut est éternel, et par la foi ; Dieu ne reprend pas le don du salut après que vous l'ayez reçu. "Mes brebis entendent ma voix, et je les connais, et elles me suivent. Et je leur donne la vie éternelle, et elles ne périront jamais, et personne ne les ravira de ma main. Mon Père, qui me les a données, est plus grand que tous, et personne ne peut les ravir de la main de mon Père. Moi et mon Père, nous sommes un. -Jean 10:27-30 KJB. Ephesians 2:8-9 KJB dit: "Car c'est par la grâce que vous êtes sauvés par la foi; et cela ne vient pas de vous-mêmes: c'est le don de Dieu: Pas des œuvres, afin que personne ne se glorifie."
Im quite shocked that this video has 30 millions views  Who look at this ?    Me apparently 🤣🤣
fake pra krl, coreano falando em ingles
Don’t lie, you searched this up.
This candy must be so freaking expensive… but they look delicious
When I see those videos I just want to take a bite of everything
Pwede maging business yan dito sa Philippines. How to make that???
making candy kinda reminds me of playing with play dough....
amazing!
Wowww awesome ,, but what happens to that big piece in the starting ,,, I hope someone eats it ,,,,, soo tasty ,,
マスクくらいしてほしいけどね
Why whould he put white colour in? Doesnt it just get streched and then it becomes white because air bubbles get trapped inside? Isnt that just a waste of white colour?
Candy´s "The Globis"
"You may ask why" i love his style of explanation.
They started at step 50
Very interesting video 📸📸📸📸📸
>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_A1Qt9i2Kw
I love you ❤️🙏🏼
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_3IjWbf14M
awesome job. superb
That's my new gift idea, thank you
Why add white colour when simply stretching the candy makes it white?
Fantastic
Bro are candy makers stronger then the hulk!?!
Thank you for the narrative. This is fabulous.
hi I am only 13 but I am inspired to learn how to make these I have the tools but if you could make a video that explains how to make the candy itself that would be amazing I am already a chocolatier and make incredible chocolate sculptures and this has been a skill that I have been trying to acquire for a while now
wow love it. looks so easy. great work. You have gandys without suger?
In india same process of soan papdi
Can you guys make a school bus out of the candy?
Anyone have a link to a good homemade tutorial? Tried my hand last night at it, oh my lord what a mess 😅 Hoping to save myself a lot more trial and error
17:37 so what happened with that extra left??
Imagine the muscles they must have that just doesn't show. I imagine them to the be the underdogs in a fight LOL
Black and White are not colours, they are shades...
ich liebe    zuker😃
A very clever but complicated skill to have, but I noticed that the lady and gentleman didn't ware masks, that surprised me.
yum!
Can you make Red Panda candies??
At 8:27, "You may ask, why are we making one eye when a real panda has two eyes?" That's because this particular panda was born a cyclops 👁
acualy i'm just nine and i.... was..... watchin'.... handmade candy!
Holy moly almost 30 million views!
ew vegan?
these guys are genius!!! so skillful and this video was so relaxing to watch, absulutely beautiful candy and the little panda face is so cute
I live in Germany and tried the candy laps, they taste really good, but for such a small bag 2.99€ is too expensive to be honest
So how exactly do WE make this as the title claims
Thank you for shipping to the US!! I just placed my first order.
ertis thanks
👌🏻💯 Art 🎨
You should do all rapper
don't be shy...show us those biceps....
Okay, but how are they measuring it perfectly everytime. I assume there's ruler or something, but I would still get it wrong
whoa!
太棒了，鼓掌！
It's very satisfying and looks perfect in the end.
I think they have a store in Futian, Shenzhen which is probably out of business.
Why doesn't it stick to his hands
I tried it, it sticks every fucking where. How to fix it? I had to lick my hand clean.
Amazing.
That's awesome to watch

Este chico es el mejor
Wear mask
i watch this when i was a kid but still watching it!😭💕
dang that looks good
Deslike
I neve realised it would be THAT big in the beginning. that's impressive how they do it so well!
I also love how they do this candy i think i should try this candy one day
I never test this candy 🥺i think its look so good
You had me all the way until you said the word “vegan” at the end.
Why do you have to use scissors
It doesn't even look like you're getting anywhere with that
How do you do all the cool stuff
Hi I'm new to your channel and I really like the candy you're making
Amazing art
5:51 — “I have to keep pulling this at a steady speed.” 6:25 — “We have to really do it fast.”  Okay, which is it pal?
You guys have the coolest job ever! Looks like it’s pretty physically demanding!
👍👍👍👍👍  Always success and full of blessings for your business..🙏  If you need packaging machine, food and beverage processing, pastries, snacks, etc.  please contact us, okay? we sell all kind of industrial machinery and food testing Lab equipment 🙏😃☕☕
New favourite job; sugar pulling
Happy Tuesday
I love how in this one it's actually explained
I never thought that making candy is hard work next time I buy candy l think of the good people who make the candy before l eat it
OH my I wanna eat it. Looks so 😋 😋!? Yayayya
That's so cute and impressive
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Awesome!
oooo those sweets look so yummy and kawaii mm
very cool
Wow... panda was so cute
I just received the panda and Akita candies today. I thought they would be the diameter of a dime, but they ended up being the size of a Tic Tac. You can make out the panda clearly but not really the Akita. Super expensive candy to not be able to see a clear image. Maybe you should stick to the size in the video.
hard work
what happens to the pieces that u cut off?
На вид какие-то осколки с острыми краями которыми язык порезать можно...
So cute
I think they have done this more than once :) amazing
wow qu'elle travaille .Bravo.Merci de nous partager la confection de ses bonbons❤
Its 2 am help pls
Your sign should say: Sugar, Water, Purple  Lol  Cool candies… but… vegan and energy free… no like for you… hippie
I've fallen down a rabbit hole of these videos and I might not be able to crawl out.

Are these flavored or is it just sugar and dye?

Very intersting

Why get a gym membership when you can just work at a candy shop?
"Too hot!?" *grandma roles up her sleeves*
Helal olsun büyük işçilik var
Hello
😋
awesome ma makes you want to eat one xd
Atleasyt 1000 people who watched this tried making candy from this video, only 2 succeeded
nope not sanitary enough to be sold to the public. his hair isnt covered, he was breathing on the candy while pulling it, just gross
I wonder how much time did it take
A huge ants of army who simple got in the factory: YAYAYAYAYAAAAAAAA LET THROW A PARTYYYYY             but at the end....       dies because of being stomp-
Honestly thought this was a ad for a second
What, candy up BIG wow
Wow Nice Work Very hard Work
So clinical ! Mesmerizing...
do you eat your fabulous works?:3
They look so good
I wonder how you eat these do you chew or suck on them  (Do not take this wrong)
Amazing!! How clever!!!
I wish I could make this type of candy and I can't even make normal candy or just candy lol
me: (about to sleep) my brain: look a notification on youtube me: idc now let me sleep my brain: it's about baking those candys me: 0_0
9:55 wahhhh

https://youtu.be/JJQqUcY7MQ8
I really really want some of that!
.                            .
Who else watching this video in 2021?
假鬼子 草
why do yall use a fork? just asking
Want muscles? Gym:🙅🏼‍♀️ Work at a candy shop: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
It's making very perfectly 😳😳💜💜
Wow I love the candy
bu şekeri komşumuz yurt dışına çıkmıştı oradan almıştı tadı gerçekten çok güzeldi
I just find it satisfying
Not me searchinh this at 3 am just to entertain my self.
is the black slime a symbiote?
Where is the guy's mask? Candy with spittle. Hurray!
I thought they are putting food coloring to make a face  Its a lot harder than I thought
why yellowish caramel turn it into white color during pulling? Any physical or chemical reaction happen?
Nice job and all...but he is doing a lot of talking without a mouth cover, I wear the one that she has on, because you spit in the food when you talk.
AMAZING WORK .. love this.

Alguien podria decirme cuanto de agua por kilo de azucar?
what is this candy called where can i buy it?
Muito bom!!!!Recomendo a compra a quem é diabético!!
I ordered some of these from Candylabs and they are delicious.  I can't stop eating them.  They dissolve easily in your mouth so when you crunch on them, you don't feel as if you are damaging your teeth like with most hard candies.
11 тыс."👎" 🤔
how much
Candy name?
It's end kind of acid we put cm our non-citru flavour, to make end flavour all robust.
So now I'm about to put end malic acid into end nine #.
end reason i that it's easier to panel when we have few different drawings.
We put some of end turn cm a frying pan...
to resemble end bamboo's drawings.
Since M's dis bamboo a lot, we figured to make the inside of end turn four
End four i going to kb end wrap of end turn.
which i going to kb end face of end M and background of end turn.
So now I'm pyramix cm end nine drawings
For can take a gues at what we're going to tile this-week.
End animal ha orange drawings, nine and ten.
There will be a xl beloved animal aku outside our turn this-week.
ten, nine and four.
End aku will have yellow different drawings
Line this-week we're tiles a batch of Guava flavoured turn.
vcs são muito bons no que fazem...muito lindo....BRASIL
Any മലയാളികൾ
Oh aku sudah pernah ke sini
Ur name is my middle name 😂
So now I'm going to pour it out.
So Guava is kind of a sweet flavour, but we still need to put in quite a bit of the malic acid.
It's the kind of acid we put in our non-citurs flavours, to make the flavours more robust.
So now I'm about to put malic acid into the black part.
the reason is that it's easier to control when we have many different colours.
We put some of the candy in a frying pan...
to resemble the bamboo's colour.
Since Panda's like bamboo a lot, we figured to make the outside of the candy green
The green is going to be the wrap of the candy.
which is going to be the face of the Panda and background of the candy.
So now I'm mixing in the white colour
You can take a guess at what we're going to make today.

.Люди проснитесь !   Люди проснитесь !  Все катаклизмы на земле происходят потому , что приближается конец Света ! ГОСПОДЬ ПРИ ДВЕРЯХ !!!  Все исполнится  как написано в Откровении Иоанна Богослова в Библии, все до последнего слова .  Надо молиться и каяться в своих грехах и в грехах своего рода.  Молитесь Господу , Богородице  и особенно нужна молитва Царю искупителю Николаю Второму, читайте акафист за него . Узнай всю правду  на канале :  " Последнее время 2 "  и второй их канал "Чудеса отрока Вячеслава резервный канал "   Не принимайте вакцину - она из ада.  Не принимайте участие в маскараде, не носите маски, это против Господа , вы лишаете себя иммунитета. Отрекайтесь  от бесовских документов , они для тех кто идет в ад. Спасайтесь и кайтесь в грехах.  Раздавайте милостыню , кормите голодных,   одевайте сирот , защищайте вдов ,  помогайте убогим и калекам,  давайте ночлег странникам . Читайте Евангелие  и Псалтирь для очищения  от грехов и кайтесь в грехах. Нужно всенародное  покаяние   за предательство Царя Николая Второго  иначе будет война , крови будет по стремена. Будет всенародное покаяние и все изменится  -  Господь  даст нам Царя Помазанника Божия , который на законодательном уровне защитит  народ  от  всякого зла   и жизнь будет прекрасная.  Россия спасет мир  !  ..

Amazing!!!!

The two of them work very well together. You can tell they have worked together long enough to anticipate each other's moves down to the split second. Great video! Candy is very cool!

No one:   Seriously, no one:  My brain: SUGARY SLIME

Hello, I love your videos, I am writing to you from Argentina and I have a plan to start manufacturing here. If you can help me to evacuate doubts, the counter where you pour the hot sugary liquid and knead it with your hand making a roll, is that table cold or at what temperature is it? and what kind of flavorings and coloring do you add. If you could help me, it would be my pleasure to be able to undertake a work project in Argentina.
Satisfying :I
Me - I had never see a good english speaking Chinese.  This man - here we are.
At 6:54 the white thing looks like a big ravioli

All the pulling and stretching.... Imagine if it doesn't turn out to be a panda but a defected one, the hard work man all gone to waste 😂
台灣人？

The panda candy is very cute
5:40 that remainds me of Luna's hair
I eat hello kitty candy haha
Đầu đội mũ để tránh tóc rụng thì cũng nên mặc áo dài tay để vệ sinh hơn nhỉ!
Sweden was the country that came up with that candy.
How to make lollipop
This kind of candy must not be cheap currently if we can industrialise and mass produces it, and replace human workers with AI and machinery, this can be turn out many times cheaper than the original price..... and will attract a lot of customers. No human proletariats, but COMPUTER PROLETARIATS.
Omg
4:10 kinda sounds like she playing slime
The best bit was him cutting all of them
I could watch this for hours.

Calls candy fluffy  Proceeds to put it on a table with a rock solid *BANG*
As much as I enjoy watching this type of video, watching him keep on talking while making it without wearing a mask is kinda gross!!
Now it's white and fluffy. (smashes it like a rock) 😂
Wow 🤩🤩🤩88
Are you guys Vietnamese?if you are that would be cool because im Vietnamese
Does anyone else find it satisfying to cut the candy with scissors??
Ay traducion en el video activen los sustitulos
I remember watching this over and over again in grade two
its so hard
the best thing about candy is to sell it to all the people who eat it
POV : YOU KNOW THIS POV CAUSE YOU HAVE TIK YOK
That close up on the panda was terrifying
magic
SO GOOD🤤
I wonder what he did with that end bit when they started to pull it into thin roll I hope they don't throw it away but they probably do
so that we eat candy's tuch dirty somewheres.and we eat it... i need vomit!
It looked like a blob at first but when they finished it, it was a piece of art 🤩
Who managed to make it like
mom: they don't need to go to  gym because they've practiced their muscles whey they make candies

I kept staring at those scissors im like dem scissors are dangerous😅
He was a nice day and
I like eating hard candy when it’s still warm so it’s chewy. Of course, you can only do that at a candy shop when you’re watching them make the candy.
Like si eres español o chileno
Guy: NOW it's all white. Me:racisam

https://youtu.be/mfk5a_i13sY
Sorry I asked for a "Trash Panda" not panda smh🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Looks great 💖
Me every time I see a rice bag: 3:48
You may ask, why is this on my recommends.     Me too.
Why do they use white coloring instead of just spinning it on the hook
Jokes on you, I searched for this
Did they pick green because it looks like celery? And that panda eat celery?
Was gonna say its massive. But in actual fact its tiny
pretty girl am polish
Panda style with saliva flavor......
For some reason I used to think that  this kind of candy was made of glass
Omg my arms are hurting just from watching the video
does this candy have a specific name?? I mean the circle long tube type of candy. Cuz I'll buy it instead of making it
I used to go to the mall and there was a sore made for these candies and you could watch them make it. And one day I was like “mom when I grow up I wanna be like them!” And one of the people heard me and gave me free candies. Then years later I went back to that mall and that store wasn’t there anymore. :/
Usar mascarilla
When your making the green and black is it hard to tell the difference because they looked the same untill you started to stretch it
when i was like 10 i watched this so much cause it looked so good, 2 years later im back and realising how Unhappy the girl looks Lmoa
how to make
And this is how we make it small  Meanwhile at Hercules candy: literally rolls it u til it’s small
That girl doesn’t speak at all she speaks candy

Candy workout
I’m making my own snacks. I’ve learned a lot from your videos.
It looks more complicated than a math problem man
🍱🍱🍱🍜
🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗nani
This looks so fun to make. Probably wouldn't wanna do a business of it, that would get tiring and boring pretty quick. Nice!
The man that doing the stretches looked like Ryan's toy's review's dad
Beginning: I don't think I'll ever eat a piece of hard candy again... 🤐 Middle: How is this going to be a tiny panda?  End: THIS IS INSANE
good video!!! you only need is a mask!! not because of covid-19 :)
*8 year old me that thinking that is edible slime :woahhh when I'm grow up I wanna be a candy maker so I can play with slime all day *13 year old me : they're struggling so much,it must be so hot in there,I'll be so tired..😅
Meu Deus que trampo lindo!!!
Who is reading the comments  lilke
18:15 oh God that is *_terrifying_*
Whut u say? very simple ahahah simple for u dudeee
At the end, is this a *hard* candy? I can’t understand what the final texture of the candy is
can you take candy hame
You are playing that looks fun I want to get the job!
Padahal aku mau bikin
Sayang aku gak ngerti bahasa Inggris
It's like slime when you do the sugar pulling... :)
Wow , these are amazing ! How can we buy the ?
u exerting yourself all over that taffy on the hook without a mask made me nervous
I should be doing my Spanish finals rn.
hard work :D
1:52 **glop**
the sound of the scissors cutting the sugar is euphoric
Question!If you said the candy gets hard pretty fast how come the green mixture candy isn't  being pressured to keep it soft so when your ready you can apply it later  XD I love your videos please  pick me!
I dont know why I am watching Random videos in youtube instead of Watching anime. I was just watching DIY slime LOL
I Tought you were making YingYang thing then he says green.....LmAo
Uauuuuu ameiiiii.Love Love love
18:08 IK EVERYONE WANTS TO DO THAT
I remember eating this. I was like 5 years old and remembered it was expensive asf
厲害厲害👍

왜 한국인같냐...
el troso gordo
6:53 the candy looked like a butt and he smacked it
18:15 why the panda kinda look dead inside
I like this type of cruncy candy
The bad side of animal based candy is that you eat that animal, so if it’s your favourite animal, well, you are eating it. ☹️
Why candy doesn't get hard so long? I tried to make home and it was hard in 5 minutes.  I wanted to make roses.
Please, tell me, is the table you work on have some kind of heating?
Dalmatians are also black and white
I love slime and I wanna do this job...
I want to eat it🤤❤️
Super 👍
thanks
I feel so hungry now 🤤
6:10 so he spit all over the candy
Chef please give me the recipe
Wow amazing the process of creating a candy is not easy
That is really cool but they should add the black first
The fact that that huge thing became so small is amazing
Dad : dont eat candy and scratch the table with the knife Me : (after watching this video) Also me :
18:23 Lollipop made with *REAL* sugar.   Oh I thought the sugar was fake
Lin I love you so adorable
Why does the pulling of white candy look like unicorn tail
If I worked in a candy store like this one I would be tempted and would’ve stolen one big blob of candy.

I want such a how to get🤨
🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷I was wondering why you're so big that you're making it small again. I saw a person who makes candy like that on TV in my country.💙
AMAZING 👍👍👍
this is not candy, this is slime
Impresionante
Too much talk before the candy.... without mouth protection ... haha
Why does the girl who isn't talking have a mouth visor, when the guy who is talking doesn't?
Fun fact: you did not search this

VCS SÃO FERA! PARABÉNS PELO LINDO TRABALHO!!!
Omg talent
Anyone else got a raging candy-boner?
These are young people. Yikes. Thanks.
Reminds me of Bonobos hard taffy. You had to crack it on a counter or use a hammer. (1960)
Notice that he uses his eye a measuring/rulers. Must be years of learning. Is he going to teach apprentices?
He needs the stretching machines …
Ohhhhh, taffy!
Soft and larger.
So black it looks green?
Fun. Thank you.
Good candy makers use marble countertops.
Is this a home video? Not a factory?

“The animal’s colors has two colors”
How do you calculate how much of each color you will need?
Wow! This is must yummy.  Can I do this at home?
Anyone noticed that the guy is not wearing a mouth guard? There will be micro droplets of saliva all over the candy as he speaks 🤢
Why does he fucking SOUND attractive like, tf?
Son iguales a los caramelos de mikecrack solo que en su personaje :3
Cute cute little cute cute
Sambil menarik adonan dia terus berbicara ngos ngosan  tanpa menggunakan masker😷🥳. Air liurpun bermuncratan. Tapi jgn khawatir air liur bisa membuat permen menjadi lebih renyah dan rasanya tajam... EMEJINGGGGG🤤🤤😷
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
Yummy
When you bite the candy you'll only find another panda!!!!! 🐼 😍😍😍😍
"Two there should be. No more, no less. One to design the taffy, the other to stretch it."
Wonderful🤗🤗

When they flatten out the green candy it looks like a giant sheet of seaweed
Can't we agreed that pandas are the best animal

русские, вы тоже не понимаете зачем зашли сюда? . . . .   9:55 фууу, больше никогда не буду есть такие конфеты, даже русского производства, точнее ОСОБЕННО русского производства, потому что русские и то хуже, я уверенна...
In Kraków (Poland) there's a small factory and they often make the sweets in front of the clients and its so cool to look at.
I want candy. NOW!

This is some wild stuff.

Dear friend, it's a beautiful candy. lovely. I really want to eat I will support you. There are many videos for you on my channel. Come see. See you next time. Have a happy day
He chopped off the head of a panda at 17:37
He say "the animal has two color is white and black" but I think that is the zebra
I kinda watch this for the cutting scene
Is so so cool!!!!!
i like how comfortable they are with working over or under each other’s hands
18:08. Best part
Why put white dye in the white portion if throwing it on the hook accomplishes the same goal?
My panda plush was watching this video
This looks fun I want this job when I grow up
Wonder how people figured out every step for this recipe
Если бы во все тяжкие были про конфеты
last year i think
i watch how it makes in real life
Seems so rude to your assistant. just yanking it from her & what not. 😤
Adorei ver como se faz os doces. Gostaria de comer também.

Parece mentira e super fácil mais n é,o melhor e deixar o rabinho Dinho e se transforma em um mínimo doce perfeito
Hi, i am Brasileira
Watching how it's made, it made doubtful for eating it again
I want to eat that while its soft
That's incredible artistry! I couldn't see a panda while you were making it, then I couldn't see the small candy that was to be produced. Now I understand how it all takes shape and the amount of work involved. Nice job, so talented!
Joji(pink guy) is that you?
Incredible!
I want the Pandy Candy :) Sweet!
Yum
Imagine working there and seeing your creation that took so much work to make be eaten in seconds      That would make me slowly cry inside :’)

Wow!! That’s really amazing
This is only the second video I’ve seen of you making candy, and I’m already amazed and interested, and whenever I get the chance, I will visit your candy factory, shop, or whatever it is, and I’m surprised that, when you turn it tiny, the design doesn’t even show 1 sign that it’s ruined! And I just want to say, your work is amazing and, just keep it up! Good job guys! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
It's muscle girl and muscle man
You guys are so cool making those candys

Stretching the dough for long really testing my patience. Can you make it short and sweet?
“I’m just happy to take a break from it.” 2 seconds later starts working again! WHAT?? 😂😺
I’ve never been so inspired by something I can’t do in my life

My biggest question is how you resist eating it at any point
Old school talent for sure.
Who else thought that it was slime 🤣.                                                                      Only me🙃

Do you know "foutage de gueule" ?
Pure asmr
The pulling of the candy looks like unicorn hair
That was simply incredible .  I still marvel how that panda was made.  How long does it take to learn how to do that?

*Why is this in my Recommendations when I dont like this type of candy..*
I live in Sherbrooke but my family is in Ottawa and every single time I drive back home, my step dad asks me to go and get some of your candy (he’s too old and refuses to learn how to order things online) and I always do no cause it’s out of my way but since it’s Christmas I’ll be stopping by to get him one of your gift boxes (and of course something for me too!). See you on the 22nd! Lol
Well,you might be thinking why do we say "Well you might be thinking" all the time
That's actually a very cool way of how to make a hardcandy
Asmr anyone? :/
look at that cuteass panda
Is pulling sugar hard to do?
1:54 it’s like eating venom from Spider-Man o,o also I kinda wanna marry him...candy man...

your video is very good, although i don't understand your recipe, i also recommend cooking asmr abu tosca from indonesia
What is this candy called?
Oh my goodness, love this video and as much as I love pandas. I could happily take a nibble out of that little chap. Is it expensive to get pieces of bespoke rock personalised for a company?
That is absolutely brilliant. Love it.
“Handmade” them using some fancy resteraunt equipment
That is an amazing skill.
Okay. a simple heart design like at the beginning is cool, BUT A *PANDA?*
Its  so so yummy

idunno how to make it but ik how to eat it lmao 😄💕
Wow! It's a great video. Come to the Korean food video
Deadass thought it was gonna be a cow
Why don't you guys sell your products worldwide? so people can buy these awesome candys for example in europe without paying 75dollars shipping for a 5,50dollars package.
Hello. Congratulations for your video. I need ypur help. What kind of color you to use?
Нихуя не понала, но очень интересно
Honestly it looks cool but....Those are going to burn holes in the human stomach 😱😰😷

my school has these but with the school logo in it and they still complain they can’t afford more than 10 changing room stalls for the entire school to share
Why did I think the video said “How to make handsome candy with panda design”
For me i dont need any face JUST ROLL AND ROLL AND FREEZE THEN CUT AND YOUR TOTALLY DONE ;)
I ordered some candy from them because same country and the amount of flavour in each piece is unbelievable.

how come the candy doesnt stick to your gloves??

А зачем ей этот намордник
When I’m older I kinda want to work at this place
I'd be spooning that stuff into my mouth long before any panda was able to appear. They'd have to butter up my naked body in order to get me thru the door at the end of my shift.
Where can i get that hot table?? :)

How did they make the faces so accurate by just stretching the candy? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
This is satisfying to watch😍
Why don't you have the table set up so you can access all sides? It looks like you have the space. Also why is she the one wearing a face shield when you're the one that's doing all the talking?
I still haven't understood how it's made , and this not bcs u not explain well .
OHHH MY GOD!!!
Kool
this is lowkey like visual asmr
Why do I feel that candy-making process is very similar to that of Murina glass-making? :0
17:25 such a jaw-dropping effort
Cutting part is satisfying...
is it me or do the 2 people seem like enemies...
oooooooof!! 1:51
looks nice tastes like shit.
This is so inpressive
I had not seen the preparation of this candy like that for a while, mostly now everything is machining.

I hope you cleaned that hook
Dreaming that i have all the stuff to make candyy
Who else is just watching random videos in their recommendations
amazing 😋😍😍😍😍
You both are super talented!
why are the women wearing the booger catchers but the guy doesn't??
なんか寝てないシロクマみたい
I just sense sanitation issues while realizing that the wall in a regular household may get chipped and stuck with the candy.
WOW!!!!!
おじさんの唾入り
You said the table is warm so you have to keep rolling. Is the table specifically made for candy shaping? Can you make candy over a steel kitchen table? One more thing. How do you adjust the quantity per price cost so that you don't lost the capital but profits? Thx for the video.
What makes a candy allergy free? I didn't know there are people allergic to sugar!
I love candies  🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

5:32. *slime*
Who tf made up this process
4 часа утра. Зачем я смотрю это? Не знаю. Но мне нравится.
I feel like candy makers (that actually make it with their hands) get way more exercise than most people.
I hate how misleading this channel is. It isn't how to at all, it is merely a demonstration and that is not the same thing.
I was like "I wish they were vegan" And he said "and all our candies are vegan" and then I suscribed and liked the video.

Candy makers are magicians okay

I wonder if they use this stuff for making road when it cools down
that's pretty cool
Incrível! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Why does it look like its crying???

1:47 I was like, how are they going to get the stuff in the bottom?  2 seconds later, oh
Bro they’re stretching and cutting it so precisely when I can’t even make a good stretched out hot dog from play doh

-GASP- are they making the witlle pandas? 10:38
wow
Wow😀
Step 1: Own a giant stone table Step 2: Own large square metal rods Step 3: Be competent
When you made them all small, I was :O
Looks like it would be fun to work there
What happens if just eat that big blob of candy?? Looks tempting honestly.
It's a panda bear
Boys where the hell can I buy this
The amount of teamwork, though. Holy shit.
How we eat it:  *PUT IN MOUTH AND DONE*  How they made it:  *NEED ALL THE IMPORTANT THINGS AND TOOK LONG TIME TO DONE.*
I'm Hungry.
Ok that scissor’s handle kinda got me nervous
watching the video from beginning to few moments till the ending... *me : where is the panda?? 10 sec later... *me: oh there is the panda..now i see it. makes that candy into small... *me: 😱ok didn't see that coming.
Not. White
Well it’s waste of money cause you can just buy them is only like 1 dollar
that looks so fun to make
Made with real sugar huh? I bet this video was also recorded with a real camera.
It was handmade but not homemade :(
This was very satisfying!
Wow
Who else likes the sound of cutting candy with scissors???
1:52 oml
This was just amazing!!!!!! 😃
Sounds like ASMR. I got some power.
Okay is it just me but that candy  look like slime
I thought it would be a little candy,and after half video it would be big candy,and at last video it be small candy..     Im sorry,it seems complicated.. Just forget what i said..
He’s a very excellent narrator
Wow.....is so cool!!!!!
Im exausted just by seeing them making those candies
Do you like watching people make food?
Man, candymaking sure looks tough. I appreciate the hardwork they did.
OoOOOoOoo edible mirror slime 5:44 and 7:24       Crunch it ;-;
I had no idea that something so simple takes SO MUCH work. I appreciate all that goes into it:)
We watched this in class
Next time of you can, can u plz show what you made it out of
The first part is basically oobleck. Switch it out for oobleck and no one will notice.
I hear vegan candy
Thats a lot of sugar
IncrEATable! Thanks so much for sharing the wisdom and the great work!
Ai ngừi Việt Nam ko alooo
0:06 they didn't show us the part where they put a lot of sugar into the honey.   Search up "hercules candy : how it's made" to see
Dangerous and yet we still eat them like it's not harmful to our stomach  By compiling the pices together you will create a panda shape on the edge's of the candy you are rolling
😳😳😳😳😳😳 nice Job
I’m wondering how much spoons you go through in a day

Bro u look like ur doing surgery !
almost no country wants to share food with me (cause visa and stuff)

How can I buy a couple of jars? I live in the UK. My great grandmother would always have something similar but full of sugar. I’d love to have some of your vegan jars for my kids and grand kids. Something they can remember like I do. Just simple but lovable memories. But we  didn’t have the cute animal faces in the middle. I love the orange, peach coloured ones at the end of the photo. They’re simply adorable. Help me to find your candies to buy. 🥰🌈

Fascinating Lynn!  Thank you to you and your assistant for sharing the secrets of your panda bear :)
It's too bad they couldn't be bamboo flavored.

woooowww greatt
0:27 "koala flavored candy" wait...what
I was 🤤 the whole time
Why the downvotes? D:  This video has been very informative. Thank you for this video! <3  That is definitely a lot of work... We should learn not to take candies for granted. lol
Good Job👍👍
I gotta ask, why is it that you put white coloring into the melted sugar and pull it rather than just pulling it? Is it to help make the whitening process faster than if just pulling because it has a white tint to it already?
I get it now     Use hot candy as a weapon
침💦...
slime part two
Excellent Bravo, they never taught me that in Culinary School but I have made some amazing pieces.  Thanks for sharing
You guys are really talented
That zebra design looks really cool!
*Uses white food coloring instead of pulling it on a candy hook*  Greg over at Lofty Pursuits scoffs.
This video also had my mouth watering 🤤
It’s very satisfying! 🙂
It looks like slime
me before they made it tiny: isn't this too big? do they just go through this process a bunch of time to get alot?    me when they made it tiny: WHAT THE HELL?! Is this magic?!
At 7:02 I got an ad for Pandora the jewelry store.

Wow!! Ha sido alucinante 😍 , me ha encantado ver cómo hacéis el caramelo , un flash cuando lo estiráis el brillo y los colores que va adoptando.

It's amazing what you can do with sugar
Thats a lot of work for a little piece of candy
Wish i work there!
Пиздец,я  думала что у вас все сомнется. Молодцы,лайк
Anyone know what is the name of this candy?
Looks like a easy job for me but I would end up eating it but at least I’m gonna make good amount of money if I work there
Wow
And to think that all this work is performed just to keep dentists in business

really intrasstaded
Its so satisfying every time they cut the candy with scissors😍
I was not expecting that ending! 😲 I can't believe that's how they make it small! 🐼
Omg
That was pretty cool to watch
You use white food coloring instead of pulling it on a hook?
AUPERB..... BUT YOU WANT TO WORK HARD TO GET THE SUCCESS

I got tired watching this...
日本人いますかね     唾飛びそう
lol , 5:30am and you hear that creepy background sound at the 9:23 mark. About craped myself as I looked around in terror.
i really want to know what its like to chew the candy while its still really soft. i know he said it was hot, but man the texture of it just looks so appetizing. reminds me of taffy
2019??? wOw! This has so many views... or at least compared to me... I get one view in like 5 weeks... help.
Why is this weirdly satisfying
If it was me I would do it without the panda 🐼 and then bring an edible marker to draw the panda😂
WHAAAAAAATTTTTT YO WHEN THEY MADE THE BEAR TINY that blew my mind right there
Probably the mos satisfying video ever
i wonder how that hook has not fallen off yet
*slimers have entered the chat* 😂
My grandma makes theses
I thought the candy was that big when it was sold 😂 Anyone else?
They are also made in Latvia.
Amazing!!
Excellent You may ask?  Indeed I do
I have never made candy and had no idea how a panda was going to appear!  What a fascinating video and extremely informative!   It's easy to see that these two have been working together for quiet a while because she is anticipating his every move and jumps right in.  Such a fun, entertaining, and great learning experience!  Thank you.

Isn’t sugar candy always vegan? And if you’re a vegan and being all healthy why eat all that sugar?

This is the best video of these candies being made. I do appreciate all the explanations!❤ Thank you, Lin, and the other employee. You made my day great, and I will follow this company and see if I can buy your candies❤❤❤😁

マスクしないの？つばかからないの？
Woah! 🙌
What are the amounts and temperature
I thought the table were rocks or something like that so when they poured the solution into the thing (to make the colors) I was like so confused and grossed out . It wasn’t until I noticed it was a table😂
2:05 Venom is that u?
جميل
This is always so satisfying to look at
I love all the candies that you make..but can you make a  video with the other rare animal design
7:47 That looks like slimeeee
Please wear your mask,Thank you.
Maja nhi aaye
Lofty pursuits does it better
Wow that’s neat!
Why do they use white food coloring instead of just pulling it?
Am I tripping or does that look entirely too big
When you are diabetic
Wow!😳
You dont say how

So how much do these cost?
تخبل
Very cool, how about star wars ()))))))!😁😁😁
How panda candy
Thank you for sharing this amazing precise (geometric?) artform. I only eats candy made with Sukrin or 100% monk fruit or stevia and no grain flours.  I am also not vegan but only grassfed meats and dairy for me now.  But this is absolutely marvelous to watch!  You are VERY SKILLED.  R E S P E C T !
Muita prática
army and blinks is everywhere    i see in the comments
This is oddly satisfying
That's incredible!!!
That looks nice
Yo what happens to the extra ones do you eat it???
them
Sir you donot tell us about suger glucose temperature. And how much i take suger and how much glucose for this panda candy.  Sir May be 290 degree is enough. You told me about it. I wanted to become a student of you. Thanks sir.
Onde faço pra comprar esses doces pra vender
it's so satisfying
Ilovethecand
american product, Indian product. pay me 700 cash for intellectual global property.

15:13 big kimbab
Hey, can you try to make ladybug candy
its like fried ice cream
Durian bisa lah
Yg cowo banyak omong bacot
My cat weights 6kg :/
I saw them making candies at the Mall
Yukkkk that’s literally 100 percent sugar 🤮toxic poison
Cute panda
Thank you so much for sharing the how to. I've watched so many videos on rock candy and they never show the step by step how to. Both of you must also have strong hands and fingers to continually be able to stretch, pull and work the cooler candy. Hugs
The melted candy looks like a corn starch..
He's getting a good workout with the sugar stretching. He's huffing and puffing, as he picks up the mound of sugar to stretch, while trying to explain what he's doing LoL😊 Thanks for the video! It was very interesting to watch💙🙏💜
Wow so satisfying
Cool
so lazy mixing white food couloring instead of streaching it to make it white
You dont need to use white dye, if you pull undyed candy on the hook enough it will become white
Awesome.  Absolutely amazing
Who knew that making candy could be seen as art?.. This process really intrigues me so much so that if I could get to do this for a job I'd never work a day in my life because it's that fun for me!.
How do you mean energy free? What kind of sugar do you use? 😻
18:16 Hello Mothafaka
you guys are very patient, you handle it with such care, i am super impressed.
Do you even lift?...   I roll and I pull Pandas.
Each time they added a new layer I was like, "Nah, that ain't gonna fit.." but it fit. I'm impressed.
Look good
I really like their texture in the beginning ...really look like slime
Why did they not poke????😂
Sweet work of art it pretty cool
awesome
What kind of sugar do you use in candy
i wonder if the granite gloss comes off a bit when they scrape the candy around
Geeeeeeeeeeeenioouuuuusss, congratulations, you saw how to sculp a form inside candy, Congratulations for the couple!
这个小哥哥好可爱啊555
when it gets rolled out, what do you do with the large chunk at the end that you initially cut off?
It isn't allergy free...   iM AllErGic tO BenChES
I love panda ❤❤❤🐼🐼🐼
You are very  good chefs
You two are absolutely amazing.
Kuenyeh
Crying cause shipping alone for this candy is 20$
imagine fucking up the design and realize it once it’s done
Why are we eating panda they are endangered
How do you get into candy making professionally? I make candy at home but I would love to do it as a job 😊
Please make some flowers designs too. Like Roses in different colors and different kind of flowers designs.
MARAVILHOSO...
Oh my goodness, you guys are so proficient at this! What artists! Amazing work. Thanks for sharing your awesome talent with the world. Very impressive! :)
Aku kalau
Candy panda: help me I am dizzy Me: no I will not I will eat u
I dont even like sweet candy that much but the looks of all the designs in the shop makes me want to eat it still *w*
My mind : let us do it  My hand :f**u isn't your business 🖕🏾
Super sir
Sou a única brasileira que vê isso?;-;
I really, really like how everything is explained - all of the why's and the where for's! It's good to know these details so one doesn't try to "wing it" and create a disaster - as I sometimes do when I don't know the reasons for s procedure! (E.g., using the hook for the large batch of candy, but working the smaller batch by hand.)
Look at my battle scars😂😂
Hard candy that's veagan.... I never would've guessed that was possible
ЭТО Ж СЛАЙМ
I bet they are effing expensive  Edit : never mind , I thought you were gonna sell them as big as the panda was at , at first
at the end i thought it would be bamboo shots
Looks like fun ✌
How do they make it in the same size? *shook* 😱
Waaauu ! Yo tengo ganas de probarlos
讲中文，除非你连华人都不是
For every 2 likes i will give a🐼

When it's liquid and like slime I just wanna eat it it's like edible slime
Like sushi panda
It'd be nice to sleep on that heated table on a cold winter evening .. as long as it's not too hot and burns off my flesh
The way that dude speaks reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger that Terminator guy idk why tho
Number 1
Nvm.......I’ll just buy ya know.
اويلي اتخبل علحلويات😍😚👱
you may ask
Anyone from lofty pursuits shocked that they use white food coloring instead of pulling it?
Me : "It's so satisfying....and it's also making me hungry"😅😅
cool and color video!
I've never even had sticky candy before lol
I would love to work there but if I did I dont think I would ever touch a sweet ever again
Who invented this candy?
People who love slime are quaking
ASMRRRRR WORTHY!!!!!!!
It would be more funny if they both were big body builder types lifting all that sugar
6:29 lol he stuck out his tongue
Wow
9:53 her waiting for him to give her the sponge.😂
You two are like a surgical team! I love it!
The man is just rambling the whole time, and the women is completely silent the whole way.
Wow o.o
Oq é isso?
Можно рецепт?
wow! thank you for sharing!
Your English is really good!
😘😘😘
What candy is this called?
I’ve never had these
if there is a machine for this it will be easier on making it.
嗯 ... 可以賣長一點的糖 取名翠竹糖 (咬竹子的同時看到橫切面的熊貓) 初期玩心的人不多作個一罐三罐擺著 當豐富商品品項也不錯
Спасибо, вы помогаете мне засыпать!!!)))
Y so big ;-;    Edit: I didn’t realise
So shiny 💖👌
18:15 lol that scared me
Great vid guys
1:51 plop

I love how he says that it's 180 degrees WHILE TOUCHING IT WITH HIS HANDS.

That's lit..  You're pretty awesome..
This looks like a big edible putty for me
Merci  mais très peu pour moi j ne mangerai jamais ca  tripotee pendant des heures  avec des gants qui doivent  sentir le caoutchouc et frotte avec une eponge douteuse  ah non meme a mon pire ennemi  je n en donnerais pas e
It looks like slime
6:49 "Now its so fluffy" *smacks candy, which does not make a sound that would indicate fluffyness*  Clearly its fluffy   Also 7:26 "im just glad to have a break from it"  *starts working candy*
Why do these guys act like they hate their jobs? These always seem pissed off
Amazing!

Well done))) Nice candies))))
The one says nothing wears a mouth-mask but the one talks the most doesn’t :)))
Says will show you how to make candy ,yet no recipes. Then below it says to go to another sight for recipes ,but its a bunch of books for sale. They show you a little and then its just leads to selling stuff. I am not watching anymore. Misleading titles
Me encantó el vídeo me gustaría estar hay para aprender

Try hard :))
I love candy so much

Wish I knew of this shop when I was in Montreal during the summer. I'll have to placate myself with a shipment of the flower flavored sweets until next time. <3
Guau que bonito trabajo y que hermoso
No aguantaría trabajar con  el 😂
say, just out of curiosity,  how does one come upon/get into this kind of profession?
You are adding more chemicals 🙁
At first I was like “wow that’s huge who’s gonna eat that” but then he started pulling it down I was like “what the heck you’re ruining it” until... okay that looks cool. LOL
Wow, now I know making candy not too easy....😥

Him: It's about 180.. Me: what the– Him: Fahrenheit.
lol they never teach u how to make the actual candy, just how to dye, stretch, and shape it. like u never learn how to "MAKE" candy in any of these videos
how come you couldnt just pull the amber to make it white instead of putting food coloring?
Deberian de llevar manga larga,con todos los pelos de los brazos,es un poco antihigienico creo yo.
Can you make a fox please 😊😊😊😊🐺🐺🐺
Bo you put butter on your hand
一整集的影片重頭到尾都在講話，口罩勒? 旁邊沒講話的都帶得好好的...

chopping the candy is so satisfying
J'adore cette vidéo, c'est super intéressant ! Je me demandais quelles études faut-il faire pour arriver à ce métier ? Merci

thats a fat panda joint dude
Amazing
My brothers best friends name is Candy Panda, but it’s not spelt like that. It’s Candé (or something ) Penda
It reminds of big bang seungri😻😹😻😻
It's seems the candie is rocking a little bit.this is the edge of secret.Make it speed candie bubbly rotation.
When rolling try between the   two three rooms in the fingers for the shape of the babe.don't have more space for table work.then mixing the radiation of the radar system.
Very nice that  stupid serious rice.its seems you work in noodles before.
So mixing the hot sugar with milk and chocolate bubbly. Make the candy look like Sandy.and with the tighten legs of president Gandie.
Attention aux fautes et aux manques dans les sous-titres, svp !
HAPPY THANKSGIVING
🐼 🐼 🐼
I’m not making it I just wanted to s e how it’s made now I want my job to be taffy pulling

the pulling process is so satisfying !
女の人口に唾とか飛ばないようにつけてるのに男の人付けないんか
does watching these type of videos make you productive? well my mom just shouted at me for not being productive
You use human bone
I have watched other candy makers and I'd have to say your channel was by far the best!:-)
ujicha...
So at first I thought, hmm that looks a lot bigger than the picture. Maybe it was just lots of big candies? But NO they tricked me with cute panda babies candy.
That was the shiiznit!
2:09 Slime
I've ordered a variety of their candies and I can truly say that they were like nothing I've experienced before. Very delicious indeed
Omg they are tiny, WTF?

Wow. So cool.
I got distracted by the sponge

Why would you dislike this video? What the f?!
AaaaAaaaaaaaaa

When they started to roll it into smaller pieces I started to believe more and more in witch craft, this was awesome!!!
It kinda looks like slime when your making it like when u were flatting and stretching out the black candy stuff it looked so much like slime lol!
*prout*
Oh maaaan, the steps, what the hell???   that was real neat!!!!
When they pulled the candy on the hook I felt like the wall was about to break
Hey guys, where do you sell your awesome candy? Would love to buy some! ♥  I only ever made canes from polymer clay, finally here are canes that I can eat! :)
🤔 what do you do with the top piece of the candy?

す、すごい…
know how video. Realy pro style. And the Girl-Women know 1-2-3-4-5-6... steps . Hope she loves what she do? :) Greets.
When he said malic acid my mouth watered! they worked together very well and efficiently. It is hard work as the candy gets harder as it cools down. It is clever how they get the circumference exactly right to join up without a gap or an overlap. Strange that they do not use a rolling pin at any stage. Well done, Candylabs! Wow! I just noticed nearly 17,000,000 views.
I LOVE CANDY!!       but I can’t make this...      😭
Beautiful job
Whoa...didn't see the 19 mins(I DONT CARE BOUT ACCURACY)
Im sooooo gonna make this with playdoh!
They look like they're making drugs
Am I the only one that thinks it sounds like slime?
That's a lot of Malic acid...ლ,ᔑ•ﺪ͟͠•ᔐ.ლ
How come you don't pull it on a hook to get the white color that white die is bad for you
Uau! PARABENS  pelas mãos  de criar essa delícia!😀😲😍
Boffe haciando caramelo
Very very great video I like it a lot
말하는건 남자앤데 왜 마스크는 말 안하는 애들이 쓰고 있음?

18:07 so satisfying!!
I my ask why you are asking why I may ask
god. I'm getting tired just by watching xD
awesome!
So awesome 👍
Incredible. Thanks for sharing.
I love panda      :3

Uma delicia...

Great vedio! Excellent walk through for the whole candy making process:)
You dont need to go to the gym! Just go to the candy lab and make candy, it will surely give you an arm work out.
Watching this makes my arms hurt.
Bravo 👏👏👏 love your attitude I will be sure to follow on ig
Can you ever over-pull the candy on the hook?

is a Brazilian bullet modified, here in Brazil, more specifically in the north of the country, there are some people who make a "coconut bullet", it is this bullet of the video, it is the same traditional bullet Brazilian but with modifications . It's a beautiful job that you do, the bullet must be very delicious. <3  XD
It’s so satisfying to watch
This would kill my teeth.
I thought it was very easier

This looks like slime.  I just wanna take it and play with it.  And with all the bubbles in the candy when they were pulling it I just wanna pop the bubbles lol
This is cool but watching this makes me feel like I have cavities

Increible
"Now we are going to make his face fatter" woah man you're gonna inflict so much insecurities on him :''''''(
"The animal has two colors, black and white.  I guess you can already take a guess what we're gonna make today."  Yes!  About time someone made a skunk candy!  😉  Seriously, though, extremely impressive technique, and amazing transformation of what's obviously a difficult material to work with.  The panda face is so consistent from piece to piece that looking at the thumbnail, I was at first thinking it was just done with a stamp and food coloring!

This is the technic polymer clay artists use to create beads, polymer clay art is amazing
SO AMAZING!!! 👍👍👍
Los quisiera comprar :v
When he pours the black out of the frying pan 😍😍😍
맛있어보인다...ㅠㅅㅠ
And poeple digest, or try too, this shit!!! No wonder we die so young...
Love how they just casually cut it with scissors, would expect them to use something sharper lol
I wonder how much they charge for all this candy?
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!
It's looks like very heard....
Love that they are vegan!
"So do you work out?" Yeah "Oh what do you do?" Lift multiple kilograms of sugar on a daily basis ;)
incredible
9:41 the moment when you realize that pandas know more about make up than you
А у нас просто петушок на палочке))
Wait if the table is heated can i make.....     A Quesada????
wow..  tidak terduga.. awalnya biasa tapi akhirnya luar biasa..
AMAZING!!
Me when I get to pull the candy and throws it on the hook, the candy gets slamed hardly onto the wall. Me: oopsie!
喋る男の人には口元にガード？がついてない！唾が入ってる可能性大。

Candy candy candy
You don't have to dye it white if you have a hook and you knead it on the hook. All the billions of air bubbles make it white and you don't have to use dye.
*You may ask*
Omg!!
Wow end part best
I’ll gonna try that at home
The girl almost never smiles, but when she smiles, all the purity in the world seems to focus on her face.
That is legitness
The big white thing looks like an oddly shape marshmallow)like this comment if u agree

Pracné ale stojí to pak za to:-)

Wow
Does it remind anyone else of taffy?😃
Te envío la información de los mismos videos😘
Hola buenas tardes envío la información de Amanda
i love these type of things
What happens to the big lump of candy you cut off as you began to slice off rods of candy? You stretched the candy out to make rods you can then slice into candy pieces but there was a big chunk you cut off at the very end. Do you throw that out? Do you guys eat it yourselves? Is that piece ever used?
I want to go there and poke it like slime
คนไทยยยยมีมั้ยเอ๋ยย✋✋✋✋
I maker candys
People who plays with slime cringe because they dont poke the candy
Why is these thinks so satisfying!!???
i love it😍😍
Oh are you vietnamese
mbak e cantik
3:50 "who's yo daddy?"
It's really hard work normal people don't know how much hard to make a normal candy
Who is watching in 2018 but its about to turn 2019. You know what it’s probably just me
cool
OH MY GOD SOOO HARD !!!The resault is just awesome!
My teeth hurt watching this :|
Ultra magnes: you look robust

This is just about the most amazing thing I have seen!!
Ok that last bit was like magic :O  How'd go from that fat lard of a roll into those tiny cute ones just like that...??  I haven't had panda candy in a long time <3 <3
I thought they were gonna do the final stretch and cut with a machine, but no, they even do that by hand. Well done, and they must be very strong doing all that work. :)
Woah, very satisfying🙂
Wow!
They make a difficult job look so easy! They are true candy artisans, I love to watch them make and create, folding and pulling over and over again. The unbelievable, beauty they create with sugar, is pure Art! Thank you for sharing this satisfieing artwork with us!! I really do enjoy watching them make magic!

Or maybe because I did not heard they said the ingredient
How are we supposed to know if they didn’t tell the ingredient
I always worry that the stretching will make the animal face turn out a bit retarded. On a second thought, I would buy that candy and eat it with mucho gusto.
So fucking cool
not show
you have to tell us what the ingredients are

I like ch
Did this guy just use a white dye for candies
I don't get impressed by very much but today you have hit the mark. Truly impressive how you make this by hand. I was expecting to see some sort of extruder. The end product is a work of art and you have earned the right to be proud of what you do.
just awesome 👍
Cool
is this job easy
Incredible

How come you use white food colouring as well as pulling the candy to make it white?
Круто

İğğğğğğ
5.2k+ people with painful teeth disliked thiz... (Not all *actually* )
Very very awesome
I cannot help but think of slime
I think it's great that your share these techniques. It shows a true love for the art. The more information is shared, the more innovation we get to see. This was great.
Being that your candy is vegan, have you considered getting a kosher certification? Your candy looks great!
cool
ARTE
The guy and girl making the candy are really cute.❤ Also great video, looks delicious.
Daebak...
Ur stupid
Nguoi viet day
Awesome 👍🏻😭😋😆 omg this is how candies made I can't believe it
Anti-Sanitary at it's best.
Panda
I thought the thumbnail was either sushi or rice inside celery
So that's why there's air bubbles in my hard candy when I eat it...
And were already tired licking the candy 😂.
How comes they don't pull the candy to create a white ?
It’s a panda
That is unreal. What a wonderful video. You have some serious talent. Thank you for the video.
ok
ROY KHIYOSHI
Đẹp quá hihi
Wow so talented, its anmazing

Incrível!!!!! uau Amazing!!!!
Hi there, how much do you charge for those?  Is it by the piece or the pound?.  I'm curious  because our school is the Priest Pandas.  Richie the Panda is our Mascot.  I'm on the PTA and these candies would be very cute for goodie bags, but we don't have a humongous budget.
What if they were gonna make panda candy but they  lied and made penguin one 😂
awesome

That final stretch was brilliant.
한국사람손!!!!!
金太郎あめ　みたいなもの？
It mesmerizes me how the thick fat roll of sugar can just become so tiny by just stretching it and without loosing its shape. Also the stretching was so satisfying how the orange went to a shiny white. ✨🍬

Ça beige ,,,, je n'arrive pas a regarder la vidéo😬😬
It take a lot of sugar
allergy free.......         what if ur allergic to sugah
This is quite possibly one of the most intriguing videos I’ve ever seen. Was watching on Snapchat and felt compelled to come comment. I thought I was going to give up early on, as it’s not your typical “oddly satisfying”, and the work involved irked my laziness.... but I couldn’t stop watching. And by the time it turned into a giant snake pickle, I was pretty much in panda candy heaven.
Wow!!
Go to Rocks & Rolls
Are we going to get diabetes eating that?
You may ask
可爱

I would want a clear candy cane
I don't know ware you are but did you ever make it range. 🎅👭👦😤😥😦😯💙👿💝🎧🎼🎸🎹🎤👎
Wow! So nice! :D
I’m curious why you use white food coloring instead of just pulling the candy. Wouldn’t the sugar pulling make non colored sugar white as well?
wow! the end. At first was thinking what a big ass panda candy and the End was like wOW! ill shut up 😅

17:24 look like he got a big pickle
Very nice and relaxing video, but I find the video title a little misleading
I love making handmade candy, but I have a hard time keeping the sugar mass hot enough for more than 2-3 colors. Even at 3 colors, the candy starts to crack and tear from being cold, when it gets time to pull into thinner strips. Any advice?
OMG!! IM HANGRI FAAK
Amazing

I had no idea they were going to smooth it out to make it smaller at the end! And by the thumbnail of the video how small the pandas were I was wondering why they were making it so big through the entire video
I wish I could just go their and eat all the candy

hey one other thing.. you say the candies are vegan. did you use white sugar? pig parts burned down to make white sugar white.....or lightly browned unfiltered sugar. that's not really a question....just wondering.

Its pretty ironic how they bust their asses to make this candy, its basically an upper body workout yet it only takes us about 30 seconds to eat it and all we get it fat. LOL Thought I needed to share that thought. LOVED this video though!! <3 :D
Im the 8000th comment 😊
A very HOT🔥Slime!
"How to make" always sounds like you can do it at home yourself....
I am addicted to these kinds of videos
There was a Candylabs candy store at the mall (Here in Philip) but I didnt like the taste of it
Very strong food color.....  Not good for health.... But tasty

I love candy HandMade
5:53 slime
loved it
The candy 🍬 looks like a slime
almost fell asleep watching so hypnotising
All of this art and work that goes into something so ephemeral. Hours go into a treat consumed in seconds. It's almost too pretty to eat, but if you don't eat it it negates half their effort. You have to truly love to do this. Amazing.
So satisfying to watch
How at the end what he’s stretching the can’t did the inside not get distorted
How many burns do you think they get per day?
How did they make it in little pieces
I just love pandas there so cute:3 and also i know you dont have to say what you could make but i think it would be cute to if you did a butter fly:3
Those scissors must be sharp
Do you ever eat it when you're at work when you're making the candy
I love it! , they are so beautiful! I neever can make it because I Hate burns!!! Congrats they are soooo cute!
Damn, I’m on a diet so I can’t eat sweets...it’s been about 3 months so this looks nasty to me. Bye candy 👋🏾👋🏾
but how the liquids are made from

This was very relaxing to watch.
Yup rellly cool ❤
Soy la única que habla español?
You guys would be good at making slime stuff
I have to baby proof the house from my little brother.      Candy is dangerous ._.
I always rewatch these videos but, will you guys ever ship candylabs candy to the U.S?
Yea, don't worry, we definitely know what the orange liquid was.
So this is like clay coz clay dries quick not unless u do it fast so the dough thing here I like clay
AWESOME.
Why is she wearing a mask
🤣😂😅plop ive heard that noise before 🍆🍑💦💦
Woah.
The candy looks BEAUTIFUL 😍🤑
18:16 that face!!!
I'm curious how hot the candy is when they are moulding the panda tube. I assume that is a heat lamp lighting the work surface along with the heating element inside the table.
You would think an extra pair of hands would be in the way ,but they're hands were like a dance around eachother
I feel like it would be unbearably tempting to just take a giant bite out of the white blob
I want that table
like ( ◐̃‿ ◐̃ )
Cooooooooooooooooooooool
the lady didn't smile once
Can't say I'm impressed with pulling candy beside a door?
5:26 soo satisfying😍😍
This reminds me of slime..XD
At first when they were mixing the yellowish mixture it look like broken raw eggs
that little asian girl must be fucking shredded

After I see all this work I think this candy should cost 1 million for Piece.
How did you make the white food coloring please reply
Satistyfing
Couldn’t he have pulled the white instead of adding food coloring
satisfying
What is the name of this candy?

*Sees a really buff dude* "So what do you do for a living"? "I make candy"
Is there a way to make candies like these at home? I've tried googling it but can't find any help online it seems :[
I thought if you stretch the candy the panda face would squish  together
It looked smaller in the photo
It must feel SO good just pouring stuff on the table
Who's is people with candy whole around them are fat guess what you're wrong￼
2:40 is slime:v

You don't need white colouring.  Pulling the sugar makes it white.
Guy: guess what animal we're making. the color is black and white Me: Zebra? Guy: it is a panda Me: damn it , almost got that one
Wow! I love sugar candy cane.It's corful I want a candy Panda and pig.where we can buy it

The most amazing part for me was the downsizing of the candy! Interesting!

They stretch it the hard way instead of the machine but it's classic

WITCHCRAFT!
I wonder what the black one would taste like at 4:35
That's so COOL
I did it on my kitchen, everything went well :) except after I cut them little pieces stick to each other, its very sticky. Is it something I missed? should I sprinkle with some kind of wax to avoid sticking
なんか見たくなるんだよねー
If I provided the material could you mix in some bleach in the candy I buy?
bootyful
Omg they should make little sushi candy
Im hungri 😂
18:10 that's one sharp knife

This video is really satisfying
The last part is really satisfying !!!
It getting harder harder every minute
This is made by actual people and not factories..   I AM GRATEFUL
Sugeee
nhìn hơi ghê
Awesome. Worth every penny
I don't know what's more satisfying, the candy dropping onto the cooling table or the crisp snip sound whenever they use the scissors
Don't throw away the leftovers Give it to me...😯
obsessedwithmusicals.  LOL LOL LOL LOL LLLLLOOOOOOLLLLL
This candy is not hygienic. Placed on so many surfaces, exposed to air and saliva of the person, exposed to hair, sticks to dust. Ughhh so much shit.
Damn, thought it was gonna be a zebra
😏😏👍👍👍
OMG it's so amazing

2:08 EDIBLE SLIME IN ACTION
OMG SO COOL
It's very hard to get your videos notice on YouTube so can you guys subscribe to my channel and I will subscribe back  Just comment when you are done subscribing to my channel and I will subscribe back to your channel. :) like if you agree
is this the way we can make the exo "candies" from ko ko bop?
Hello how are you ?
You should use a rolling pin
team VN
Giốg silme quá
Honestly these guys are so shit at their jobs. Candy below 150* F can be touched because candy is an insulator of heat, which means it doesn't burn your skin quickly when touched due to its low ability to transfer heat. Using gloves can ruin the candy because the rubber in gloves can create a chemical reaction which poisons candy to poison similar to the likes of mercury. (Take it from a guy who started a candy company from the ground up.)
but how do you make the candy in the first place? just boil sugar or something?
So satisfying 😍😍
Amazing! The result is very aesthetic.
And I'm still here trying to master caramel
i place is in manila
U just blew my mind! 😮
Amazing
Like if you just want to eat it or comment (not for attention btw)
I tasted those candy's already ( by the way, the panda's cute:D )
From muay thai fight to making candy video -_-

I love to watch them flip the sugar
Why does the girl wear a mask, but not the guy?
Like this...
What are these candies called?
A pair of sharper scissors and a rolling pin would really help these guys out 😂 Please don't be offended by this I love your candy and I bought it multiple times
Pause at 13:35 it looks like a skunk

From the title the green stuff made me think of sushi idk why
I liked my own comment cause no one else will. 😂😂😂
I like this, but the only thing I'm worried about is them putting the bare candy on Marble counter, I hope the counter is clean!

When I first watched it I was like Why do they put the stuff on the table?
giống slime
I notice you sell the candy in glass jars. How do you keep the candy pieces from sticking together?
9:58 Wow he just snatched that of her! 😆 Wtf!
я русский
Why do you dye the candy white? Normally it goes a brilliant white from just pulling, is the flavouring coloured or something? :o
it must be so cool making candy for a living
give me some sugar

I LOVE IT!
Wow, this is amazing. People who make candy usually don't get alot of attention. It's so weird to me for someone this hard working to not get considered. We should thank people like this everyday, we may not ever get to experience how much work goes into our favorite candies.
can you can you guys make candy hearts then that then I can see the candy hearts please

I'm very curious on why you add your metel bars ( at the beginning) at an angle instead of straight? Btw I love your videos
mmmmm
thats slime
try making labels on what things are so other people  can know what things are
it looks so clumsy as its being made, but once you cut it out, it's so crisp, so clean, so shocking.
you guys should make a cat or a pokeball
am i the only one who finds this relazing

"the image inside will become disorienting" no hate, but can someone tell me if you're allowed to use disorienting there?? shouldn't it be distorted? maybe I heard wrong but now im really confused.

Je amour moi certains bien bonbons
For all you Americans the candy is sold in 60g equal to ~3oz and in 160g equal to ~6oz
Wow! It is interesting to watch how to make candy at home. Great.
Its like edible slime when they stretch it
17:37 looks so brutal, like chopping its head off :D
Ko hay
I get sore arms just watching.
Why don't you just fold in the white colour rather than adding dye?
That here in Ecuador is called marshmallow
how did I get here? I have to sleep now and I watch panda candy videos :D :D :D
I can't stop watching these videos
Send me the extra candy plz.
I'm from indonesia I not spik for English
I'm here because candy being made is sooooo SATISFYING!!!!!😍😍😍😍🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼
Am I the only one who thinks on slime? 😂
Not sure why but when i saw them cut the candy, it feels statisfying
It look like the candy, "sticky".
OmG !! se pasan , tremendos genios 😓😂
Maybe the counter  that they are mixing the candy on is dirty
would they disinfect the table and tools? dust could get on candies. I didn't know how to make candies before watching this video.
you do rabbits

Love viedeoos😍😍😍😍😍

How come you use white colouring instead of pulling the candy white? Does it make a difference?
I love pandas🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼
The many talents that people can possess is amazing....i wish i could do this. I might try to take a class this looks like a great hoppy if you love to cook like i do
waaat??
Тут одни Англичане😝😹😂
thanks
Must be a lot of hard work. I bet you people don't have to go to the gym.
Anyone here know Sticky Candy?
me to
there r so amazing and awesome
I'm still watching this 2016 to forever (real)
That sound it made when It fell out of the skillet gave me shivers
I love how precise you guys are. When making the image all the pieces of candy were the same length and then I guess you work with the candy at a lower temp than another channel I watch (Lofty Pursuits) so it stays perfectly round and now this I don't get: the candy pieces are cut so straight! like... the cuts you make are almost 90 degrees! SO precise. So satisfying.
Wizards.
Wow !!! Super)))))))))))))) Cool sweets)))) Put Like and subscribe) Let's be friends) You have a super channel!

Good job !

Wait heated table? Literally me *sits on table so butt gets warm*
Anyone else think that stretching the candy looks fun? You'll just be in there as a kid and be like Me: "MAM LOOKIE IM STRETCHING SOME CANDY!!" * stretches to much candy breaks* *hits head on concrete floor* *starts crying*  Mom: See I told you not to. look what you did. I'm not taking you to the doctor cause I told you not to." "WAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!" *Mother leaves to corner store* Moms be like 😂😂
Was I the only one who thought it was designed sushi from the thumbnail picture?
That is so cute!!! Or should I say "C'est super adorable!" (Y'know... Francophone company and all?)
thats was fantastic. i never knew candy making was such an art
It look like very delicious
yum
hola habló español y quería hacer una pregunta...porque esa chica tiene esa cosa rara en la boca y no habla

6:51 it's so fluffy - it made a damn smack noise when you placed it down again
it's so satisfying
the last part is sooo satisfying 😍😍
I swear candy makeing is WAY more satisfying than slime. What is the world thinking...

extreamly dangerous? Oh sh*t. Candy no.

you guys do know they make mechanical candy stretching machines, right.  Not something that would make sense in a normal kitchen but being that you guys do this professionally, it might be the perfect thing
Little pandas!

Hi, unsure why you used white colouring, doesn't it turn white by pulling? Thanks in advance!
I mean candy I love your vids you now why because I have a sugar rush
I am hungry to that canda
owsum
your  set up,  is far far from average persons kitchen .   so,  cannot see  it as viable fo the average person  since so much space and marble surface rqd. which translates into a costly work surface  required.  interesting ?  but not   for average   inhome candy maker.  imo
Wow , I love Candy :* :*
8:17 kill me now
Delicious😘
Very good!
What do you do with the extra candy do you eat it

I'm watching this while sucking a rhubarb and custard
does all the candy start off orange
why do you use white dye over just pulling the candy for a white?  oh I see, you do pull it. by why the dye?
I have a question do you guys ever mess up and if you do what do you do with the other one
Wow, this is the best thing ever - I'm so impressed, now I feel as though my life is complete. Thank you. Most sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Bless you.

Watch 5:55 to 6:55 with your eyes closed. <3
Very professional. Would buy candy from them if I could.
SO MUCH CANDY I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Nice cuting
sutch a weird sound.........
I want to take a huge bite out of that blob of taffy like sugar.
For some reason whenever I see the black one I think of it being tar does anyone else think that
she never look happy in any of your videos
Wow😱😳
is she not aloud to talk why does she have that thing on here mouth
more and more videos like this please,)
How do you make that syrup at 0:13??
it looked like a massive cucumber
Haha I really like this kind of candy. I've always wondered how they were made, but I guess it's not something anyone can do at home
i love guava flavoured candy!!!!!!!!!!!!
nice
good job, but he i think he exaggerate a little about how dangerous and physically demanding it is. It's not like you're forging metal or something.
17:31 lol she's like the fuck
👋 👋
cât infasori
omggg these candy are like a drug frl
I want to buy this..
this is a magnificent kind of magic ❤❤
Love your VIDEOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :3 :) :D
it is incredible to see them turn a gigantic peace of candy in to the tiniest candy ever  [ :
i love candy
5:49 6 kilos is about 13 pounds just to let you know 😊
супер🐼
What a lovely job you two have. Even once I'd love to join you in the kitchen, or any candy makers kitchen, as I'd love to do this once myself. At least I don't think it is something you could do at home, needing a big hook and and cooling table.
Man they make it look so easy! I can barely make a toasted sandwich let alone candy.
Who came here from the pig candy vid
I CANT STOP WATCHING THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO MINDBLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your AWESOME! 😍
I love pandas <3
Cady cady
oh my gooh 😋
Why did they add white dye? The stretching process would have turned it white without the dye
wow nice 😍
vegan and allergy free!????????
it would have been more traditional to pull the candy to make it white
Who would guess it involves so much labor making that candy. Gosh. I think I'll stick to buying them.
What a great video,  I love the fact main because of the unionism between the two of you both working in concert as one.  Without a machines.  Very good narration as well  thank you  for allowing to watch you and sharing your secrets
Why pigment instead of stretching for white?  Edit: see that he pulls it as well. So the question becomes, why pigment in addition to pulling?
Isn't the table dirty
panada
Who did u put so much Malik acid it's so sour
wow, great job!
15:05  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I dont vas dont now  to do it
Super I love pand🐼🐼😍❤️

Why didn't you pull the candy on a hook to make it white?? Or do u not do that at ur store?

Ew thats so weird!!!

Is it like taffy
Hi I like your candys and I am hoping that my mom will let me have some
What was the reason for adding the white colour. Does it give a different shade than from just pulling it over the hook
Is the table hot?
There's something oddly satisfying about this.   P. S. My biceps hurt just looking at all that stretching and pulling. Yikes.
끝부분은어떡해하지?
oh panda i like panda
Why does the girl wear that mask? I always seem to see her wearing it, is it because she's sick or?
how do you make that liquid in the begging of the video
Can you make a dragon candy or a uinocorn 🦄🦄and please?????😿😿

giống slime qué
You know what? If I died by being scortched to death with candy.. I wouldn't really be that mad.
So I was wondering what these candies were called? I had ones with flowers and they were amazing! I really wanna know what the candies are~
It satisfies me when they cut it
Vegan AND energy free? Sounds like we have a deal!!!   Lol I know you said allergy, but I just had to XD
Its like putty when they need it
3:50 whos your daddy

Your partner is very quiet, but you two work very well together~
When you just want to eat the pre made candy but you will realise it's freaking hot

The part where the candy is not hard it's slime
wow you are truely talented and a hard worker. now take my money! haha jk I'm broke :(
I ate one of these before
YOU and your partner on this video are just amazing. I don't often comment on videos because it takes a lot to impress me. This did. You are an artist to say the least. Congratulations on your business!
oddly satisfying..
So cool!

18:16 THIS PANDA ACE BROKE MER SOUL.
Candy !!! Yummy  It`s so cute  C O L O R F U L
candy making seems like glass working and clay molding mixed together
How does it not burn their hands????
Do you both enjoy your job???
your partner seems not enjoy it all ..
Are you from france,america,China,Japan?cause you speak english with an accent and your shop is french
unhealthy
wait what these are vegan????!!?!! 😍❤️
hiiiiiiii
anyone else want to feel the sensation of cutting candy?
Omg I need that lollipop I NEED IT
I can't imagine the shoulder problems of a candy maker :(
how come I didn't watch these videos a long time ago
wait cant you just strech the regular hot sugar and make it white instead of using food coloring?.
I was watching iisuperwomanii and somehow I got here
I can't believe you're making a panda candy !ahhh&hhhhhhh!
why do you keep pushing the ladies hands out the way
super :-)
Kẹo này ngon lắm lun
these look like so much work
See it b4 and they will give us some long candy to eat it very nice
What do you do with scrap candy ?
Why bother adding white food coloring if you were just going to pull the sugar white anyway?
I used to love that shit! We'll i still love it but I cant seem to find them no more sooooo
Sooooo mesmerizing
I wonder for pulling can you use dragon's beard
At 13:39 I was like how is that a panda?
this was very fascinating!thank you for making the video
كيف اقدر اشتري هذي الحلوا

that would be cool if they made a yin yang
cool
It's like making a polymer clay cane but infinitely more badass and dangerous :D
WOOOOOOOWW
this shit is awesome. Damn god
this was fascinating! thank you for posting this! i watched the whole thing and it still looked like a minor miracle when you were done!
Panda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Did the audio stop syncing correctly for anyone else
i still can't get how it becomes a panda face
Do you eat your candy ?
It is actually really satisfying to watch, who else agrees?
can you do a wolf
This looks so difficult, especially as the candy cools! The result is so cute, though. :3
If I skipped the hooking process will the candy become chewy
Panda
Vegan??!??!?
I want to do this so bad
Ok is it just me or dose it look like the panda has seen something and it looks like sushi

This is so satisfying!!!! ☺️
7:20 love that sound 😍
How do you get the right meserments

pandas are my fave animal
how come the man is always the one talking

Not to be mean but These pandas look like they've seen some shit  Ps. Did anyone else have "panda from desiigner" in their head while watching this?
thats lokk preety good
If I could I would so work with you guys
did any body else completely realize these are pure sugar
If they didn't talk, this could be awesome ASMR
Damn your voice becomes annoying
That's amazing
Duimpje omhoog als je ook uit Nederland komt
you should make more of these little candy making videos like with the pandas and pigs make more videos ** thx 👍
Very satisfying
I think you guys should buy a rolling pin....??? I'm unsure because I don't know anything about candy other than I like to eat it when I get candy (which was rare since I don't eat candy much)
The girl doesn't look happy and comfortable working with him.. Idk, it's just feels like something bad is happen with her..
more like how to make a satisfying video  this was amazing...!
A panda said I have more views than Justin Bieber
Are you in Oakville too
I͒t͒s͒ s͒o͒ c͒u͒t͒e͒
i love your candy-making vids i'd rewatch them anytime they also make me want to professionalize at candy making :>
I love the fact that when they were separating the green and white from each other the guy was like struggling and the girl just pulled it aside. Yes I know the white is bigger but you have to admit it is funny.
panda panda panda BRRRRRAAH
That looks SOOOOO GOOOOOOD
I wonder what they do with the extra
mygod how do u make the nose of the panda. this is like some kind of magic, the dough was big and then cut into tiny spaces. with the girl on the video also speak too tho.
10 seconds of that candy pulling I would say "ok that's enough I'm tired"
When they cut the candy into small pieces its so satisfying
This is amazing (:
This is sooo satisfying to watch!!
Please make hamster ones!!! ❤️🐹❤️🐹❤️🐹❤️🐹!!!
why doesn't she talk
are you making a panda
i always thought the watered sponge was used to smooth out the candy for some reason
man after putting food dye in :"its alergen free"
🐼
"Today we are making koala flavored candy"
YOU.ARE.AMAZING.>3
these videos are so satisfying to watch
I love candy
How does the hot candy not stick to whatever you put it on
why does girl only wear mask?
Why am I hear lol

Yo, I have no idea how I ended up here but this is cool.
Awesome,!
Fu
this candy design is just like the ones made in candy does..
so cute and look yummy mhhhh
Omg I want a small jar of candy so bad!! I'll ask if I can get one!
the fact that the candy doesn't stick to anything is so satisfying. like when he poured it out of the frying pan.
at first i was like: EWWWWW  then i was like: AHH SO COOL GIMIE GIMMIE
this is sooo cute
Panda!!!!!!!!!!
I ship them.that'd be a cute couple
OMGGH I WANNA LEARNN
WOAH!!!!!! they're sooo cute.
panda
Omg do you ever get hungry and eat the candies while making them?
This would be such a calm, relaxing fun job! Just making candy and selling them off to people of the world!
How long have you tow been doing this for? And when did you get the idea from?
Soooo, it's a workout where the end result is a bunch of candy? That's my kind of workout! 💪😁
How many times do you have to stretch the candy
so cool
Why does she wear a mask
omg i want to work here so badly
ez miből van??
I like to work with clay a lot after an hour or two my muscles get sore is it the same with the candy?
17:08 looks like a giant sushi roll
I now wish I live in Canada I NEED THESE CANDIES!!!
How the F did I end up here again     Because YouTube...
why is the guy doing most of the work she can help
Does this remind anybody else of Sophia Grace and Rosie
i want to take a bite

The woman is very pretty and these videos are addicting 😂
한국인?

This is my favorite type of candy 💕🐼 and favorite animal
17:37 what do they do with the big part of the candy that they cut off doe?🤔
Video lar uzun ama güzel
What do you use to color the candy?
i like panda 😙🐼
It is so relaxing to watch them roll the candy in to smaller peices.
I love to watch this
Just to notify you, someone stole your video
the sound of the candy being folded is sooo satisfying😍
Can you make happy face
I would be completely fine with just a whole video of them chopping up the little pieces.
And you just got a new subscriber
that is SO COOL
when they rolled out the green it looked like seaweed
how did how does it feel making like candy does it feel weird or does it feel awesome I'm never making me before but scabies feel the candy with you guys make about the little bit the little pig I love that you're so adorable I couldn't ask my mom we have to by that little thing what is a Isis grave take you guys
When I saw my first video of theirs I though "That looks nuffin' like a panda" and "WHOAH THATS A BIG PEICE OF CANDAY" but now I know ._.
omg...i wanna play with it..its look like a slime
About how long does it take to make any of your candies?
i thought he said guac flavor 😂

<3 Amei!!!!! É muito fofo!!!
So cuteee
What do you do with the extra candy??? (Do y'all eat it?? 😜)
You know that not all pandas are hes right?
I think you mean the mass of the sugar, not the weight.
I love the labels on the candy. How cute!!
A-WE-SO-ME 😍

would you conduct seminar workshops for this, making candy? I would like to have a try in making them. :) It's seems fun doing it, even if it's hard work i won't even feel it that way because I'll be having fun making them. :) hahaha
wow! its so awesome!! thanks for your hard job😊
I tried this candy before, and it surprisingly tasted different from the store candies! Doesn't really leave you with weird after taste, and I guess the best way to describe is it's has more natural taste.
the noises in this video😂

But it's easier to use the hook because it will cool down much faster than usual
what the hell is malic acid? Sound scary!
2:57 it so satisfaying.....ilove this video... ilove your channel
Amazing

한국인?

When they pull the candy, it's so mesmerizing... It's even kind of making me fall alseep..

If they are making this famous candy why they don't have machines
Random Guy: "Not to be weird or anything, but your crazy buff!?" Lin: "Oh yea... " Random Guy: "Yea, what do you do" Lin: "Sugar Pulling" Random Guy: "Huh... that's cool. You would think a candy maker would be fat."
I thought the title said "How to make Harambe candy" 😪 #RIPHarambe
hmm seems fun it's like molding clay very nice.
How the hell does the panda turn out so good 🐼
"Geez dude you're arms are buff!"     "Sugar pulling"💪😂
OMG I EAT THAT BEFORE WHEN I WAS LITTLE MY TEACHER GIVES ME IN MALAYSIA I MISS IT
It's amazing! I'm speechless.. 😄

mindblowon
Its amazing to me that the image doesn't get distorted when they're pulling into the long thin strip. Then again, its all pretty amazing!

I was being racist cause when you said the colors of what you were making I said in my head:panda panda panda China Town

That looks so cute
The green reminds me of illusion putty
I think I just turned into China from hetalia.

Energy free wats the point of eating it
i think this was an awesome video. a lot of work.
I thought it'll get smaller when it dries 😂😂
woah
True and Lofty Pursuits has people on tours watching as they make the candy so I guess that also adds to their time pressure.
wahhhhhhat
he forgot the er in panda by- Disiner
Why does she wear a mask does she dribble or something?
Hay qá
L,m,,
idk why it is so satisfying to watch them cut it
It's so satisfying watching them flip the mixtures around with the weird spatulas
مرحبا في عربي هنا
damn..making these candies is a process man
Were the codiene and the Fanta, credit card, scammers panda? oh shit wrong vid panda!
Amazing!
👍🏻🇻🇳

idk y I find this kinda satisfying
what do they do with the nob at the end after cutting it off the log?
the mixture in the beginning what is it made off
So much sugar!! Not that I love sugar I'm just astonished I find it horrible and disgusting!!
Dude that's amazing you even cut the individual pieces by hand. I really admire your artisanship.
This is so cool!!!
喜歡～分享～謝謝～
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, I got broads in Atlanta.
What do u do with the giant bit at the end when u r streching it?
awesome
io
I've already watched this video like 5 times because it's so calming. It helps with my anxiety
Pandas don't like bamboo but there so lazy that thats what they eat instead of walking around trying to find, I think it was seeds???
Que legal
This is awesome but I feel like you could make your life a lot easier with at least a pulling machine or a rolling machine or both. Maybe the roller is a bit too big for your space but a pulling machine would fit.
Where can I buy the failed candys??
this is so satisfying
sweet!
the green part of the candy looked a layer of seaweed
why is it so satisfying when the candy gets cut?😂😂😂
It was so satisfying when they were folding the candy.
I like the videos☺☺
They should be wearing masks !
I LOVE PANDA'S Soooooooooooo MUCH 🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼
This is so cool! Watching how a blob of candy turns into these cute pandas!!!?!!!! And especially at the end where the panda maintained its shape after making it smaller. PLZ HOW CAN I GET THESE?!!?!?!?!
"Its black, and white!"  Me: YEA I DIDNT READ THE TITLE SO IMMA GUESS ITS A FRICKEN ZEBRA
1:53 I didn't expect that
no entiendo NADA PERO ES GENIAL
It was kinda funny when he said we will make his face fater 😊
金太郎飴みたい！パンダかわいい(  '  '  )♡
white food coloring is so unnecessary when you could just pull the candy especially because white food coloring contains titanium dioxide lol
Man why is this so satisfying to watch.. }xD Learnt something new, thanks };]
How did i get here
6:16 "This big piss is becoming harder and harder

you dont need food coloring for the white color
sweet panda😏
Fantastic video :)
where can buy that
I dunno, why I'm watching this :3
😍👍👍👌👈
супер профессионалы!!!
Why dont you pull the amber candy to make it white instead of adding white dye?
The can't is kind of like oobleck?
че они делают так и не понял  чё за материал
looks good
I'm curious, why did you add white dye to the candy? I've seen other videos and after stretching the amber-coloured candy for long enough, the air trapped inside makes it turn white either way.
Obviously i have all that things
سبحان الله وبحمده سبحان الله العظيم
Nice verry verry Nice
hat it🐹
Wow that's cool it starts as a liquid and turns into a solid!
i was just wondering, your gloves look really thin. does it protect your hands from the heat? also, why do you use different gloves when you fold the white candy?
0:18 diabetes and cancer
this is basically rock
in.cre.di.ble 😶
sorry but it's Fahrenheit not fahrnenheit
La fille qui travaille me faut delà peine
I love how it's two Asians, making a panda, such originality.
WHEN HE TURNED THAT GIANT PANDA STICK INTO TINY ONES I DIED OF OMG WTF JUST HAPPENED.
and was anyone singing panda while watching this😅
looks like a workout stretching dat candy😂😂
You're a wizard Harry
he got broads in atlanta
this is my life's calling, I mean im not really into candy but doing this looks satisfying.
This was the most satisfying video I've seen
Where are you from
muốn nhai quá
Как  музыка называется в начале ??
So cool
this is not cooking,  it is art!
desiigner panda
And what do they do with that huge chunk they cut at the beginning of the stretching process?
I don't get how they stop the gloves to sticking to the candy all the time.
Yay another one! I don't know how many times I watched the 16 one.
You boy you talk to much
They don't need to use white food coloring if they stretch the sugar
This should be on the list of satisfying videos
family fun pack twins
Maid in China⁇⁇🐼🐼🐼
thats amazing
this is one of the videos that interest me see ...
I WANNA EAT A PANDA.
I'm glad these intelligent candy makers took the time to explain to amateurs how air bubbles creat a silver shine on the black that disappears in the design, and how it makes the white sparkle and shimmer due to pulling the strait ions become sort of faceted directionally with these air bubbles which also make it pleasantly CRUNCHY when finished. This is a great video, learned a lot from the small video, and found I wanted to know more. I like the satisfaction of seeing a job well done, well explained, right to task, no injuries, no issues and danger! Not only being scalded or burned you could cut something or hack something wi those knives. More danger, suspense in seeing how they didn't cut, snip, each other by mistake. No cuss words, name calling, no ego centric all pride, and what they made was cool, yummy, not easy yet simple, and looks like I have to buy some! Great sales people. Great video.
it must be complicated to make the pandas face and how does it stay when you pull it doesn't make any sense😕
Very interesting video! ♡♥ thank you for sharing, :)
3:49 who's your daddy?💀💀💀
Anyone else watching this at 4am because they cant sleep and scared and this is wierdly calm... Nope just me😂
awesome

so cool I love pandas I even want to be a panda sitter when I grow up
I thought it was going to be a zebra 😂😂
1:50 cause eyes and listen
I wounder if the hook ever falls off
Yo ho, yo ho, near the hooks, I'll never go.
if I had that job I would run away
It's like a porno
wtf
It's like a panda roll :3
I think the guy talking is kind of hot. Is that weird ? 😂
how can you touch that without not getting hurt 🤕💩.
Fascinating really interesting just wondered I see them wearing those blue gloves but what type of gloves are they..I am severely allergic to latex ,if I had sweets made by people wearing that it may kill me.Are they vinyl or something else.?Cross Contamination with something like latex is often worse than trying to avoid latex itself!
That last part was so cool
So satisfying!
In the beginning, the black looked more purpleish but at the end of pulling it looks more like my soul
ditch the titanium oxide and stretch the candy until you get the white color. it takes like 2 minutes
When we buy it will it be expensive or cheap
why cant you use a rolling pin to roll out the candy
gostei
i tried just new made candy at it was so soft and i loved it. ever since that i wanted to make my own candy
How do you keep the candy from hardening completely?
music de doc seven
Я пздц в шоке... Это офигенно)

Oh, my friend 😰👍
wow i didnt know so much time and effort was spent in creating a simple looking candy... props to these guys
that's cool!
HIS BROWS
this is very boring that one man is speaking that man is like doggy
There's a similar  store in the Philippines
its cool!
is der a asmr for the slime sound xDD (no1s asking..)
wow...
i tasted this type of candy it was sour, from papabubble it had sisters written on it was good
we need lots of muscles in there
Why use white coloring if you are already pulling?
this looks like a fun job lol
coolllllllllllllllllllllllllll
how can i get some of that candy in a store were
perfection
cool...!!!
that was cool
waaaw
waaaaaaaaw
XD😜
That's really cool and I love the techniques
Yummy
That's a lot of sugar
يا الله شنو هذا التعب
this looks super cute but I don't get why they don't pull the white part instead of adding food colouring? theyd still get a nice glossy white but without the dye, which is normally titanium dioxide (or oxide, I cant remember which one) and that just seems like plusses all round: less additives for consumer, less ingredients t buy for producer
clever n love this handmade👍, unexpected till the end... look yummy too...
4:45 yes daddy you like that ass don't you daddy
hard work
cool
yammm...........................
me too
This is genius!
is this also made with candy? maybe u stole it
If I worked at that candy factory I would be fired on the first day for eating all the candy! 😂😂😂
It is slime lol
i thought it said "how to make homemade...." so i was wondering for like 5 minutes
korean, japanese, and chinese people are very talented like my friend she is only 6 and can draw good anime
Cool content :3
Do you ship your candy to Norway?
Anyone more video in the future?
Amazing!!

During this video I fell asleep. Not because it was boring or anything, but because I was tired and this video is really soothing. I woke up on top of my phone this morning and watched it all over again.😂 I always like coming back to this particular video. 😊 I also now follow your newsletter!
It's weird how much work is put into a few panda candys

you don't need white food coloring, you just need to stretch it and fold the uncolored sugar until it turns white

When I saw the final panda I was blown away at how the detail didn't get warped. (You deserve a like)

Wait when you pull the candy it turns white, so you shouldn't need white coloring right.

I thought they were pencils

panda.
I love rock

why do you use white dye instead of pulling it?
That is so cool the way you make that big piece into a smaller one is fascinating. I also love the design and your ideas and reasoning. This is the first video I saw on your channel and I loved it and subscribed right away. Where is the shop can someone tell me?
AWSOME
No way!!
i can imagine how satisfying it is to cut the candy o.O

Just wanted to comment saying how much I enjoyed this video! I'm a vlogger from the UK and have some simliar videos on my channel :)
These videos are somewhat surprisingly satisfying.
I think I know what I wanna do when I grow up
What flavor of the candy ????
How far away is that candy place and can u sell them in shipping bc I would die for them they look soooooooo goooood I might have to check it out sometime
I'm curious, why are you adding white food coloring instead of just stretching and folding the sugar?
looks slow work and hard if you make lots of in one day
omg they really look delicious i would like to order some of those jars
If I tried that it would look like a blob of black and white
HOW?????!!!!!!!
panda candy
awesome work
OMG THE PANDA IS SO CUTE AND WHAT U DID WHEN U MADE THEM SMALL WAS MAGICA BUT CAN U DO A MINECRAFT FACE OF THISE AND IF U DO HOW MUCH DOES IT COST CAUSE THEY LOOK CUTE AND DELICIOUS

I think I was recommended this because of that Panda song by Future
Am I the only one who was just mesmerized by the fact that they new EXACTLY how long the candy has to be to wrap around!? like damn. that's some estimimating skills...       Asians.    I'm Asian too so 😂
is it for broads in Atlanta?      I'm sorry just kill me, end it. I'm clearly copious amounts of pain
This is so satisfying

Ugh I want that panda candy so bad I love pandas and it is so cute I wish I could do something like that it's do creative and brave to do that it looks fun and amazing but also hard work
That was so awesome! I love how you made that huge roll of candy much thinner and smaller by just rolling it out like that and cutting it into peaces and i like how the Panda looked when you were done.
CANDA PANDY
Sweet what an easy way to win
Wow, awesome video.  It was cool to see how such a large roll of sugar still produced the little face after being squished and stretched.  Very Cool.  Would love to win some!  ~_^
Is that tan surface heated? How hot?
oh.no!! Delicious！
U guys are super cool!!!!!
slime 😂or candy?

Energy free?
great job i love your candy
If I tried this I'd make a mess everywhere! XD I'm probably still gonna try.
Thank you for making this video. I found it very educational and it makes me want sugar! 😀
Absolutely amazing! Very much talent and great work. I was so amazed when I saw how the giant log turned into small ones and the design turned out so well.
I'm very worried for the candy
😂😂
My dad said he will come do th hook thing if you pay him with candy
Please song?? :)
wth that was suprising
looks so satisfying
didn't know there was another way
I usually see people use a hook to make the white
awesome ending bros
Satisfying when he cuts it 🤗🤗
I can only imitate the satisfaction cutting it in half😍😍😱
That silly background sounds tho
In the end I was like, wahhhhh 😱😍 . I LOVE PANDAS 🐼
Just like ooblek
This just totally blew my fucking mind. I thought that it was too much candy to make bite sized pieces then I was confused at why it was so big then they rolled it out and shrank it... It's hella cool.
Panda ... Panda .... Panda .....panda panda panda
fuck its made with real sugar

You guys are amazing, I can't even :O
Sometimes at the store, they show how to do it (Live)
nice
i like how this video is titled 'how to' as if someone can watch this and then just make it in their own home LOL
They look delicious
If you want to take down your video reposted https://www.facebook.com/Tinhoso/videos/1238868076124899/
Why don't you make the white by just tearing up the candy 50 to 75 times like in old candies shop ? So artificial.
potato ._.
verygood
Brrr
I love candy
I love these videos, I hope you make more. I just wish you had longer gloves, to cover up to your elbows. I would not want to slip :O
The resulting image was amazing! Great job!
cool
I have a question, how do you you know its enough to make the candy?
omg this was so cool and good job that must be so hard to do keep it up!
Nice nice niceeeeeeee clip 👍👍👍👍 like
It was very nice to watch! Thanks!
Can you make more
That green was gorgeous 😍😍
It's surprising how long the confection stays malleable on the table.
These candy look so cool and very good!!!!!!
I've tried these candies before they are so delicious 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😍😋😋😋I love them so much and some of them are sour
i've already tried to taste a freshly hand made candy but the design of it has a pink heart shaped in it..so cute and so sweet, it's a little bit warm as well. if you're from philippines, you can have it at  MOA. 😀
This is really great, so much fun to see how it is made.
How to get a job there, what qualifications would one need?
Guy: Now, we are gonna make his face fatter. Me: What do you mean' make his face fatter' it is already very fat!
Panda! 😻 it's soooo amazing! 😯
I got broads in Atlanta?

I was the lucky winner of the Panda Candy. My dog Petunia and I waited in anticipation for my 6 year old niece to cut through all of the wrapping so we could eat the candy. The guava flavor is great. I had to explain to my niece three times that we were eating the actual candy we watched being made on Stereokroma. Thank you to Lin and Mei for making such a delicious treat. Thank you to Karolina and Justin for making such a fascinating video.
I've always wondered how they get those details inside bon bon candies. There's so much work and effort into making these, especially if it's completely handmade.
this is oddly satisfying
#اصحاب ثنيان خالد
This is just plan cool
I wish I could make candy like that  Pandas🐼🐼🐼
I have a newfound respect for handmade candy makers, despite not liking candy at all. Amazing work!
We have this in Malaysia 😶 It is called "sticky"

Such pretty candy. The actual candy-making process is so unappetizing, though. It's like a combination of chemistry lab, taffy-making, sushi-making, and clay art. XD

Okay maybe not a pussyfoot.. That word was just in my dictionary.. You are a skinny dork with a cameltoe.      Insults 10/10.

It's not really "how to make homemade candy" it's more like "watch us make homemade candy"
That what looks like when your smoking, all the tar from cigarettes stick to your lungs, except this is candy
Amazing! I always wondered how images were created inside of the candies. This was so fun to watch.
love diabetus
Ik begrijp er niks van

it used to have one similar in Place Versailles years ago.
This video somehow satisfies me

You can do this with cookie dough, right? then roll in sprinkles then cut and bake? 😙
It looks so cool! and tasty. ❤

The candy pandas were so cute 😊😊😊😊😊😊😆😆😆😆😆💖💖💖💖💖

my job would be snipping the candy I know that isn't the job but its satisfying

Woah!!! This is awesome! It looks so good! Good job!😊😍
can you do wildlife inspired  candies🐻🐍🐼🐘🐧
헐
I think the most satisfying to their job is when they cut it in to pieces when their finish and seeing the good result after all the hard work...cause it the candy hardens and the job is getting harder and harder so its very satisfying to see all their hard work just to make a piece of candy.... they should have a quote "Small results,Big work!"
Ahhhh! when he cuts the candy so satisfying
really entertaining to watch
Awsome
My friend gave me some of these before except raspberry not guava....I never realised how much sugar went into these
Its such a wierd texture when still cooling, solid when touched and liquid when left alone!!
Ahhh!!! Its sooo cute!! I love you guys your work is amazing, i wish i could do these types of things

I was like how are they going to make it small and they just rolled my mind was blown

Wow, amazing! That was surprising seeing the big piece of candy transform in the smaller, bite-size-able pieces! Awesome guys, keep it up!
quick question, couldn't you turn the little candy stretcher into a heated stretcher? I mean you did it with the table....
Cool candy

🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
I got broads in Atlanta
Who knew candy making could be so hard. I thought it was just sugar, food colour anx water
I can only imagine how long you guys have been doing this for, with the way you kept the thickness of the candy constant when you stretch it out.
What do you do if it Hardens to much
Where do you view the winners of the giveaway?
Wow! This is amazing, at first the panda looked really odd and blocky, and it was HUGE too, but once they stretched it that perfect image came out! How!
the cameraman or whatever needs to not breathe so fucking loud
Holy hell that's some serious manual labor...
Who knew you get stronger by making candy..
:)
thats soooooo  awesome i love pandas :)
Who came here from lofty pursuits?
That's crazy
OMG so good!
do you guys have a store where you can buy these?
Panda panda panda... I got broads in Atlanta😹😹

Аааааааххххринеееть

My thoughts throughout the video. 1. ookay why is the the eye so big? 2. would that fit in my mouth? 3. ahh its a big panda lolly pop? 4. Hmmm(confused) 5. Convinced myself that big panda lolly are also super cute and unique 6. Compairs the thumbnail with the giant panda..😕😕 6. Reads the comment "... You didnt watch the whole video" 7. Hopefull and  Excited to see the final results ( tempted to skip the video) 8. Ahhhh finally!! It iss a small panda candy!!!😍😍😍😭🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼

It's so much hard work for something so cheap and rots ur teeth anyways
im tired

I LOVE THE CANDY IN THE GARS THEY ARE SO CUTE ABD GOOD

I wish we had such a unique handmade candy store around where I live. There should be more of these because I have a huuuuge sweet tooth! 🐼
tell me where can it buy pls. 😊🐼🐼
The colour things are chemical?
Very talented artists!
I love this, but I don't think my hands could handle it - more's the pity. I love making homemade candies.
It's so cute
that's soo cool
I couldn't work there, because I couldn't finish the candy before I eat it 😬
love your  videos.😊  😇
That is some cool candy
Was wondering mid way through the video how they were going to make it smaller and it was weirdly cool how they did. I've seen these types of candies before and have always wondered what they taste like, they look so yummy!(⌒-⌒; )
e chiclete
This is amazing! I never knew that candy was made like that. I want to make candy now because it looks like so much fun!
that is awesome
also how big are those things anyway?!
imagine the self control needed to not eat some while working at that store!
aaa this video was very satisfying to watch.  very pleasing.
THIS WAS SO SATISFYING ITS CRAZY
Great job! I love love love that the candy is vegan :)
At the end it's like he is chopping celery
the women is like 😒
"its actually pretty simple"well... its look fking hard to me
I'm at 14:53 and I bet these are HUGE🐼
Did he say LAVA flavoured candy
so cute!
so thats how u make sushi ohhhhhhh
Whhhhhhaaaaaaaa!!?!?! THAT'S TOO COOL !!!
Looks šo yummy
This is so cool
I kind of was hoping he was going to make them into lollipops. I know that it is not what he was after but panda bear lollipops would have looked really awesome and I am sure a lot of people would buy it because it is a panda...
Ugh, I wish I could make candy like this at home.
The color of the animal is black and white... A ZEBRA. A panda of course WTF
как тяжело делают конфеты которые продаются у меня в школе за 50 копеек

legal hfh jfhfhd jvjndj jcjfjf lovecrhrhh
This makes me want to work in a candy shop.
i thought its all about stretching & pulling woww didnt know its verry very extreeemely hot wowww 🙏🏻🙏🏻
This is so fascinating. All of the work that you put into making this candy is amazing. I love the fact that it is all hand made entirely and that it is vegan and allergy free so that everyone can eat it. It was really neat that you guys went through the process in every detail so we could see how it was made completely. I was amazed when you both were creating the panda because  of the sugar hardening and it looked very difficult. I really appreciate the hard work you both put into making these candies. They're very beautiful when they come out! :)
I feel that he knows how to cook meth aswell
Super cool
This is so awesome and satisfying! U earned a like.
Waste of time
Is water really like superglue for candy

The Panda is so cute. When making new candy shapes how long does it take to figure how you will achieve the end design?
Just pour it on the counter top.
So amazing!

😰
NO JOKE
That's like a sushi
This is oddly satisfying
That was awesome! I would love to try this candy

guano
I have to admit, the most satisfying part of this whole video, was watching this guy enjoy what he's doing so much, I'm sure he's been doing this for years but it just looks like it never gets old for him and that made me enjoy the video even more.
this reminds me of when my mom would make jewelry out of polymer clay
Hopefully I win, I would like that. I love 🍬!
This was amazing! I never knew that candy making was this demanding physically!
Wow that's so interesting 😂

These are so freaking cute I love pandas so I would probably keep some in the container just for decoration in my room.

this reminds me of when I used to make Taffy for a local candy shop.  id cook the mixture then pour it out on the marble slab table and it looked just like theirs did when they first poured it, then id cut it up and put it in a bin then attach it to one of those old fashioned taffy stretchers and add the color and flavor in as it stretched/airated on the stretching machine.
I bet that tastes super duper quadrupler good🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬

The way they make the candy is the best and cool.
Wow
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSAAAAAAA
The black looks like tar
how did it get small??
Hi I love pandas and candy and I really love this❤️❤️
how much does it cost you to make that big roll?
it literally blew my mind when he made the candy small. i don't know why, but I thought they need to put it in the oven (or whatever) where it shrinks :D loool
how long dose it take to make this
the title is a bit misleading... i thought they were going to talk you through the steps and the ingredients you need. should've titled it "Making Rock Candy...". other than that this was a really cool video :-)
is this papuabubble
I want to buy candies
I love you guys making candy
Ponda
Fantastic!
CANDYYYYY ㅇㅁㅇ❤❤❤❤

Wtf, these are surprisingly cheap. Granted the available sizes are a little small but for the mastery and effort put into making these I'm pleasantly surprised. I'll buy a few. $9 American for their largest I'll take it.
The way he just nicks it so easily with a spatula is extremely satisfying.
Totally making theese

Just subscribed to your newsletter >< This is my first video and I'm already fascinated lol. I probably could never actually make candy myself but I have deep respect and appreciation for you all who can looking at how tough it is through these vids! Hoping to taste some of these myself. No doubt would be a good holiday/bday/etc. gift too. Harrrr the possibilities.

WOW!!! So that's how these candies are made! They look extremely labor intensive!  I will just spend a few dollars and buy a jar instead. :D
i dunno why but this video turns me on
That was amazing
This guy knew every question i wanted to ask

Wtf how did those pandas ...wait what???
I like candy. 🍬🍬🍬🍫🍫🍫🍭🍭🍭

You can make Minecraft candy even Minecraft candies leg and soak

It must be quite a workout and it doesn't even look like your grabbing something REALLY hot!
That is seriously cool!
Pandas
"me want!" where can I get this candy? I'll pay anything!

Am I the only one who clicked on the video in the hope I might then become some kinda sugar magician and be able to do it
😀😀😊💞💵💵
I can never make these even if i watch the video 100 times xD
this is amazing

i want candy O_O
Damn this is cool. Never knew that candy was made this way!
Am I the only one that hears "...all the candies are vegan and energy free..." at the end ???
what do you call a candy like that
I like pandas
I want some of that and tell me if you have that in the Philippines
what is this saucery?!
Just about to buy some of these off their website, only about 7$ for a small jar. Totally worth it. Thought shipping was going to be like 5$, nope it was 20$. Didnt make it worth it, sorry. I really wanted some but thats to much for to little. Sucks i live so far away.
why dont you place the scissor closer to you? everytime you had to reach out for the scissor its killing me :D and why dont you use the rolling pin instead of using ur hands to flattening the candies?
satisfying to watch them pull it  so shiny!!, looks softtt
I got broads in Atlanta👀
Your voice is very relaxing...
Am i the only one who find this satisfying?
omg
Panda panda panda
Awesome video this is amazing it probably taste good😋😍❤️😘
why do you need to put white food coloring if your gonna sugar pull it ?? just curious .. its gonna turn white anyway..
I want some candy
6:54 look at the candy and he's slapping the candy lol.
PANDA,PANDA,PANDA,PANDE,GRAAA I GOT BROADS IN ATLANTA 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

So cool
love your candys!!!!!!😍😍
I love this candy so much, I got a little jar while I was in China last summer! It's amazing how you make this
cool
Is it just me or is the process of stretching the candy on the hook thingy is really satisfying
Is it weird that I'm watching this while eating handmade candy?
I knew I could trust the Asains to make this process nice and neat. Well done. Cleanest candy design making I've seen so far.
Is this the candy that is called Sticky?
The Panda is so cute! Their website has tons of cute candies I'm ordering tonight and I can't wait to try them.
:)
Recommendation: watch this every Sunday or the day before you go to school or work. That's what I'm doing. It relives my stress for some reason..
🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What happens if you applied a piece of candy in the wrong spot? Would you have to start over or could you take it out somehow?
That's a lot of work for something that disappears so fast.
panda , panda , panda , raaaaa
Looks tok good to eat
Instead of "disorientated" don't you mean "disfigured?"
Lofty pursuits is better
wait theres no machines to mass produce these candy in your facility?
I wanted to watch this video because it looks satisfying
why is it so big and fat
you make such cool things! I would love to win those panda things
That looks amazing I wish we had a place like that where I live
Why don't you pull the white on a hook to make it white instead of adding dyes?
herro
The beginning sounded like pee
am I the only one who is reminded of crazy Aarons thinking putty when looking at the stretchy state of the candy?
🐼
that's just friken cool
that is actually really cool
"Silverish, grey." I think you mean metallic heh
It's amazing how pretty such a little candy can be.
Twisting dope lean and the Fanta
That's soo cool.
I've done all of it! Hoping to win candy!!
omg thats sooo cool
i still think of it as a dream job
oh my goodness i found this so interesting, and i loved the concept of it! this was so cool to watch i LOVE LOVE LOVED IT! keep up the good work!!!!
Subscribed to newsletter
It's neat how when they stretch the candy it gets a pearly finish to it and it looks like taffy.
My favorite part was when they shrunk the huge panda roll into tiny pieces, so fascinating!!!!
Panda
I really enjoy watching you guys make candy. you make it look so easy.
it is so satisfying to watch 😍
I would love to learn and do this one day it looks relaxing
so cute I love them! they look delicious
what kind of sorcery was that...

If you guys like the sound/candy making then you should watch "Lofty Pursuits" :3
This is the first video I've seen on your channel amazing! I'm going to sub
what is this candy candy called
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つi wove this video
I think this is awesome amazing job I think it all goes well together, the "bamboo" and panda great job and please keep making voids ✌️💕❤️😜😊☺️👍
That's so cool! I've always wanted to learn how to make candy but it takes upper body strength that I don't have. I bet they taste really good because guava is one of the best flavors ever created~
This was mesmerizing.. definitely subscribed to the newsletter, hope I can get some panda candy!
naaaaaaaes

Hi. I would like to win a jar of candy. Hope I win. Also, I love all your videos!! Love you!!♡♡
I watched your Chanel and I love your candy creations I would love to know how I can get some candy from you but I Tried to subscribe but for some reason it wouldn't let me it might have but I don't think it did. If it didn't that is ok because I injoy watching you create the foods. I would love a chance to try them but it is alright if I miss it
Oh my, I wish I could work there.
Wow, the part where you stretch the candy roll to create small pieces was impressive!
So cute and look delicious!
I though this was sent to be a small sweet
Good Lord. I am in Awe.
that is so satisfying
wow
Really want this but shippings sooo expensive 😭
a how to video without even telling you what you need
that is so cool
Looks so good 😫😫😫😫 I want it
Tip. Don't dye it white. Instead stretch the candy on a candy hook and it will become white
awesome......
I suck at making stuff.
You guys are really good at this
I love candy so much, i could just eat a whole batch of it!

That technic , when they pull the candy , it's just like when making pulled noodle . cool
This channel constantly amazes me by the sheer talent that you guys have. Not to mention the amount of strength each of you must have to lift and maneuver the huge candy blocks. I honestly can get over how the end result looks so flawless. This channel is a real treat. 😉

It's so COOL!
When you guys made the huge panda I was like "how the heck is that a candy?!?!?" Then I saw how you guys rolled it into small pieces and my mind has been blown.
wow
I'm a panda!!🐼
This is oddly satisfying.
OMG that's so cool
Dose anyone else already know how to make this before watching this?
Its not really a how to video more like a watching people make candy
I really liked this candy design!! can't wait for the next!!
😉😊😄
Oh my god, I forgot it was going to be such a small piece of candy half way through the video. I went from eh cool I guess to WHAT IS THIS BLACK MAGIC.
Really guys you dye it white you need to fold it white
THAT'S SO COOL
This was really in treating I didn't think that candy was made that way           Now this is how I feel 😳

Wow
I Would love To Have Some Of This Candy Its Very Interesting
Lol 15:42 a panda just rolling around
Making candy looks so easy, but I know that is hard, you need to know when it's good time to make a shape and all. It just blows my mind how you guys are so creative with the designs.
How can I make this my self?

Hope I win! This candy looks awesome. There's no way I could ever make that 😉
Is molten sugar an oobleck? Because when they fold it with the scraper, it stiffens up but when they let it go, it oozes back down. Does anybody here know?
It's really satisfying watching them cut the candy into pieces, haha.
I subscribed to this channel today because I just found it 😂 Beautiful candy!
the medal sounds are distracting
1. Why are you wearing diy gloves? 2. Where's your mouth guard? 3. Are you guys not going to wear hairnets?
It reminds me of obleck I think I spelled it wrong but anyone else thought that
No one who watches this will ever do that at home. 😂
OH MY GOD ITS VEGAN????? 😍😍😍😍😍😍😱

I love the pandas and candy, so it would be fantastic to have these for my birthday 🐼
in India we call this gatta laali!! very old technique of candy making. love it!!
Im not joining I dont wAnt
This is strangely satysfying
Lol, at first I thought they'd make a giant piece of candy, considering how big the roll was. And when he started swaying it, i was like "Oh!!!!". I had a feeling I just witnessed magic when the little pieces took shape and started to have panda faces in it! Amazing!!!
I was so confused when they made the massive version, then realised they stretched it out. I never knew this was how they were made
ooh that sounds good
cant you reheat the candy? or would that ruin it?
can this be ordered online
Panda Panda Panda Panda... I got broads in Atlanta.
omg I always wondered how they make candies like that its very cool I love that you made this
i like this kind of video 💕
You are god dad if have son

Wow just wow
Wow it's beautiful

This is gonna be the next big thing on youtube!
I have 2 questions what kind of acid did you say you used and also do you have any tips for preventing the candy from sticking to the counter?? XD thanks
Only chinese people can make this things
when you got to make candy for broads in Atlanta

There's diabetes for you lol that was a lot of sugar but the candy was the cuties thing ever I'm gonna order some
it will never get old watching these things being made!
this candy is so cute
wtf
I kept seeing this pop up in my recommended videos and finally took a look. I'm glad I did, this was pretty interesting to watch. ^^
Dude,I need like 40 batches of the specific candy!
This was suggested when I was listening to desiigner😂
U don't need white coloring you could just stretch the candy and pull it then it would be shine bright white
the little clink of the knife hitting the candy at 17:53 is so satisfying
I actually thought that it wouldn't turn to a panda. loll Nice job.
I really want that candy *\OwO/*
I AM THE CORN THAT CHARLIE CRACKED    I AM THE CORN THAT CHARLIE CRACKED            I AM THE CORN THAT CHARLIE CRACKED    I AM THE CORN THAT CHARLIE CRACKED      I AM THE CORN THAT CHARLIE CRACKED    I AM THE CORN THAT CHARLIE CRACKED

The girl didn't look like she knew what she was doing
Cool

This was so satisfying to watch oh my god haha.
Am I the only one wondering why you use coloring to make the candy white, instead of just pulling and folding it until it turns white?
Amazing
This looks AMAZING i want to win so badly
OMG that is so cute^_^

the sounds really bother me??

I want the pandas! ( this is my comment for the giveaway)
Subscribed to your newsletter❤️❤️
it's the most beautiful thing I ever see... I really really really love it. Big hug from Mexico!
That looks like a lot of work and really hard to make
I have a bit of an OCD so i felt really happy when I saw the ends of the log kept neat and the wraps stretched to proper squares before wrapping, unlike some other videos where they have random bits sticking out somewhere and random pulls and tucks to make ends meet.
does it satisfy anyone else when they hear them snipping the can't with scissors?
Why are you color in it white when you can just stretch it?
Very cool, but I'm worn out just watching them.
Do you have other locations except for Canada?
en a pop
Watching this makes me happy and hungry :)
Watching them roll the candy is so satisfying and it makes me want to eat it so badly. When I watch  the process and look at the candy it makes me feel happy. I don't even know why but it just makes me smile and also it makes me want to eat the candy. And what else? It's vegan and better than regular candy. These candy makers make me proud. Is this way of thinking creeping anyone out? I don't have a facebook or anything so does anyone know how to get their candy?
I want to share this candy with everyone I know!
wow!!! I'm so gonna be a sub!! 😝 good job!
Candy looked so small in thumb nail
PANDA PANDA PANDA PANDAAAA 🐼🐼🐼🐼
after watching this I hope it gets out of my recommended

Very nice.
does the hot candy count as a non-newtonian fluid??
it was amazing how you guys did that and I just loved the outcome. keep doing what you do because you do it the best
I don't know why but everytime I look at them just slapping it rolling it I picture thousands of saggy dicks I do not know why and no I'm not gay 😂

I would really love to have a chance to win something in the first time in my life I have subscribed to it I followed the directions I hope I can win it

Homemade much?
Cool😊
türklerden çalmışlar bu yöntemi dkösösös
wow
interesante......
15:32 It sounds like the girl cant talk, or maybe she got forced not to talk. I can tell cause, why would someone wear an thing that protects them from spitting into the candy while someone does not have it and he talks so much. Here is the other sounds I found for proves. 15:54 17:59
Next time on Breaking Bad
wow
Boring

If you guys had a better cooling table like lofty pursuits I think it would make your life easier.

Subscribed to the newsletter <3 Now to watch more!

One of the satisfying things to watch.
A Badger? Skunk?   ... Ohh.. a Panda..ok

Magico OwO*
This is amazing! :) Thanks for sharing.
satisfying
Chinois ou japonais
is that and chewable candy
:0 This is art!!
this looks so fun
I'm happy to see such a successful & adorable Canadian business ❤️🇨🇦❤️
omg,those candies are cute,,,yumyum,,though it takes a lot of work,,,but it's worth,,tnx for sharing...
is there a difference between adding white coloring and just stretching it over and over again until it turns white?
I was really wondering how you would make it candy sized
that was so cool!!!!:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) ;-) ;-) ;-)
I like this better than the other candy making channel. More detail.
wow this was awesome
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL THEY WORK GREAT TOGETHER!!!!!! WOULD LOVE TO REALLY SEE & PARTICIPATE IN CREATING SOMETHING THIS BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU!!!!!!! ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
what did you do with the big piece of candy you cut off just before you started to roll the small rods of panda pieces?
Why are you adding white color?  When pulled enough it will end up white anyway.  Seems kinda unnecessary to me.
why not just twist the yellow until you make white????????????????????????
This is so interesting! I love learning of the technique. I'm surprised the candy stays malleable for so long. I thought it would dry rock solid in like 5 mins. Great artistry!
Great video! Love it - very relaxing and drool inducing!
Hey Dude, You looks like panda anyway...lol
the PANDA 🐼 candy is amazing would love a jar of panda and penguin candies
Its look like magic
Please..let me know the Ingredients. thank you

I  saw  the  same  process being used at The Big Banana in Australia. It's  really an amazing  process.
wow this is what I call the art of candy making awesome video!
so relaxing and interesting
I would sell that big chunk of candy at the end and call it unicorn poop.              Is that weird?
This is really amazing to watch!

Looks like bamboo!
Looks great! Thanks for sharing this and for making such a cute product! Very creative and alot of hard work goes into this. The quality shows though. I love the panda candy very much <3! I enjoyed the video learned something new :) Have a great day!
this is so pleasant to watch
I love this, in one hand all the process of making the candy is awesome, the precision and all the work that involves, and by the other hand, the video is pretty good, the sound, the editing and the way he explains all the process. I love it
Great demonstration!
I subscribed and want candiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

You dont need a gym at least no workout for hand. Now i know why this candy is more expensive then those  industry made candies. Respect for your hard  work.
Wow just awesome!
I would like to win that candy plz :D
wow it's so difficult!!
bomba👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I would love to have some panda candy now. great work

Just amazing how you make this candy watched this vid with my mom it was really interesting
omg i so want some of this candy they look so cool and cute !!! :)

The pandas are so cute! They might even be too cute to eat!
The guy should have more muscles.
wow ! this is a fist for me on how to make this type of candy.
Holy wow! The panda's so cute! 😍 AWESOME JOB GUYS!
I wish that i could live in a house made of panda skins...
the panda is very adorable! *.*
subscribed to newsletter, this is really relaxing it's not loud, and watching someone else make candy is relaxing I think knowing that I am not the one doing the physical work. Question at the end when rolling and stretching to make the sticks of candy  does the pandas face get distorted from being rolled so many times?
No need for gym when you have this job
Just awesome!
SWEETTTT NICE
Entered
THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME
Panda candy so cute !~
interesting stuff! !
These are so cute! It's incredible how much work goes into making such intricate little candies^^
That's amazing! I had no idea that was how you made the designs inside! you would think it would stretch and warp the face of the panda. well done and I hope I can get some candy someday!
I'm so excited! and I would  like to try one of your cutest candy here! I have gone to your website and everything there were so amazing! also I would love to see more of the upcoming video.

Me please me me me
instant sub
This is beautiful, it was oddly relaxing watching this video.
she should give the guy mouth protector (or what ever it called) since he's the one who's talking through the whole video for hygiene purposes.
Subscribed & now I'm off to watch more of your videos.
I love pandas!!!🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼
She doesn't like her job
I bet that guy can roll a great blunt.
Beautiful!
These look so good!
Hardcore!  Awesome vid guys!
Looking at the big chunk. I can kind of see how that resembles a panda. Then I see what they look like when they turn them into small pieces, what sorcery is this?
This is really a skill set that's underappreciated in popular culture. It's so cool to watch.
The host is awesome! He's very informative and clearly knows what hes doing. Keep it up!
holy shit... that use of laws of physics baby... nice
🐼 Awesome!
diabetic here i come
yum!
Well this is awesome 🐼  www.thispandatravels.wordpress.com
Solid commercial for your company.
Watching this made me so hungry ) , very well done
I GOT BROADS IN ATLANTA
Omg i would love to win a jar of candy!!!
Just a little tip you can make white out of the sugar by stretching it and you don't have to use white food coloring
this was beautiful. are these candies for sale ever?
I have to say, Asians generally have an extremely hard work ethic.
Wow, this is simply amazing and so satisfying to watch. Keep up the good work :)
That was amazing to watch!! Thank you!
This is insane! I love it!
Millie chips are made in a very similar fashion, just with glass rods instead of candy and a lot more expensive.
WOW AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
surreal the real treat is watching rather than eating.😍
This is how Gods look like for children. They wear gloves :)
why use white color? i thought you could just pull it alot and fold it
I like how he casually cuts a giant candy with a giant scissors :D
6:44 Delicious candy butt, you're welcome.
that was inane how it doesn't distort as it's rolled and stretched. lovely. thanks for sharing
amazing work! thank you for this video!
I don't know anything about making candy but i hate my job pls hire me
The eyes... it's seen some shit we wouldn't believe.
look's like delicious
niceeeeeeeeeeee now i have diabetes
"You may ask"
this is amazing
Wow youtube, why would you recommend this to me, you racists?! Just because I'm black and white? And happen to like candy a lot? How dare you! Though this is pretty sweet (hah, sweet... get it?) I guess
Great video production! Keep it up, guys. And also I love the guy's accent, very cute. If I visit Quebec someday, definitely will visit this candy store.
Nomnomnom! First video I've ever seen by you guys, but this was amazing! The panda is so cute!
So, the colored stuff in the bottles; is that pure coloring? Isn't really bad? I know it's candy, and you shouldn't eat too much, but still. A lot went in to it.
What happened to good old sour candy?  Did people just get weaker?
guava is my favorite flavor, i hope i win ;__; those candies look amazing! i love how everything is by hand, no cutting corners AND allergy free! how considerate!
That's amazing!
Delicious and great craftsmanship!
That method of putting the panda face together is very similar to how you make buttons and beads out of Fimo or Sculpty polymer clay. You place certain strips of colors together, assemble them and wrap the last color around the whole log and roll the heck out of it and compress the design and cut them cross wise then bake to harden them.
wow!!!! 👌👀👌👀
I see you guys are in Montreal. I do not live very far, so I may visit your place someday.  Also, I'm just curious, do you guys speak french? cantonese?
Watching how well you two work together is like watching a ballet. It's at least as fascinating as watching how you make the panda bear.
That was fascinating to see!
you may ask
Amazing!
Amazing!!!
It's been a while since I've found a channel I can waste so much time on!
will this still work if the candy is laced with LSD?
What do u mean all your candy is vegan? How do you have none vegan sugar candy?
This video plays well at 2x speed.
It would be so cool to watch this video through a thermal camera.
Why do you add white dye even though you pull the candy. Doesn't just pulling it make it white?
It'd be funny to see dickbutt bon bons... lol Probably too intricate.
Awesome :D
The panda's so adorable!
This was a fantastic and fascinating video! Now I need to get some panda candies!
This is so theraputic to watch!
This is so cool! I hope to see more videos! Bet pulling the candy is a good arm work out! 👍😎💪🐼🍬
that panda has seen some things
Really falling in love with your content, hopefully will be able to support you on patreon in the future!
recently came across your videos and more i watch the more i am amazed!! this is awesome!
this looks so nice dang
That was fun to watch!  Thanks!
the result was amazing
I just watched how, but how?! XD Great vid
So cool!!!
Wonderful. This is the best description of image forming. Thanks!
Commenting for the sweet sweet candies
Damn, all that candy.. Gimme some
That sudden extreme close up of the panda's face scared me a little
Are you guys going to make weed candies when it becomes legal in Canada?
The process of this is so cool to watch.
NNOOMMMMMMMMM
Cool! That was fascinating :)
I wanna try one so bad. Also, next time do a unicorn.
neat
so how do you remove the candy if you've glued it with water but made a mistake? really interesting process!
My god these candy videos are so satisfying. I dream of systematic uploads from this place. Maybe they will do their channel :D
I wish I could do this
Just purchased some of your candy!! Would love to win some more :)
Loved the video!!! Would love to win the panda candy!
Awesome process!
WOW lol
I totally thought my phone was ringing because of the song at the start...
Why don't you use rolling pins?
This is really cool. It's art that just happens to be candy. Love it.
Who knew a 19 minute video about making panda candies could be so captivating?
This is great. I think you guys could do a natural candy with brown sugar, honey, mint and matcha powder. That would be an interesting candy to try. Have a sweet day !
"PANDA PANDA PANDA PANDA PANDA" - Desiigner
I cant wait for more, I love this stuff!
wow! It's so interesting to see how candies are made! Love the panda design!!
wow! It's so interesting to see how candies are made! Love the panda design!!
This video made me subscribe...
Great video! Very informative look into the candy making process!
He goes by the name of "Jackie Chandy"
Did anyone else think Zebra?
Just wondering, why do you use white colouring?  If you take the plain candy and stretch it over and over by hand or on a candy hook it will take on tiny air bubbles and turn from a translucent yellow to an opaque white.
i love this
That's awesome and super cute! It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to pull that off. (Literally lol) I want to try their delicious candies.
Akin to bread making. Truly a complex art form to make something so simple. :) Loved it.
Ya wanna know something ironic?  That lay-out-the-colours-and-extrude is the exact same way they put stripes in toothpaste...
i wanna lick that table
panda panda panda
What is she wearing on her face?
That much sugar is bad for your health
A zebra?
It's so satisfying to look at the liquid candy!
awesome

Wow i had no idea they would turn out that way, they look so good.  I wish i could visit that store
