You don't want to use landscape fabric you want to use geotextile fabric. Landscape fabric would never hold up
"err.. that's why it's green", that's the only time I hear Roger being caught off guard
Wish I had a mini excavator. Digging in maryland soil is liken to mining
Is Landscape Fabric the same as non woven geo textile fabric ?
Haven't seen anything on this but hypothetically for yard drainage. Instead of running pipe all the way to an outlet or bank how about A dry well with 1 pipe that runs to the bank to drain the well when water is actively draining into it from the additional perforated pipe that run into the dry well to drain yard?  Would this concept work?  Trying to avoid buying 100s of feet of pipe
Another great how to for the younger generation first time homeowners, RIP Roger!

RIP Roger.  About to do this project this weekend.
Can you do something like this to keep your creek from flooding your yard?
Very cool 😎
Do towns want a permit for this type of work
I forgot to knock out the small holes. Is that why I have a black sludge in the bottom?
3:33 "so this exposed to the surface "   "not under ground by eight inches like you told me at the start"  You guys think in circles. (lid should be brown?)
Definitely should have wrapped the drywell itself. And, as a plumber I'm always draining into the top cover hole not the side of the drywell wall. Use a 4-in TY and continue the pop-up emitter upward so that its flush with the finished grade
You need a drag line to go behind your lawn tractor 🚜🤣 would save you alot of digging
This could work for the toilet or washing machine also the kitchen and bathroom sinks.
How much stone did you use?
Would this freeze and still be okay? We were told to dig 5 feet deep so it wouldn’t freeze
Nice you covered the end result with adds.
"..grab the rubber hammah.. take it.. and tap this puppy down in place."  This guy is definitely from New England. Boston maybe? 3:07
Neighbors ever poke their heads over the fence for pointers?
All of that stone they are using has "fines" in it already, that will clog things up eventually. Any good drainage system that has water moving through stone needs washed - rounded stone, with no fines and more area between the stones for water movement and but it costs more so contractors skimp and will already have your money when things go south.
what happens when it rains hard or long? a) dry well is filled to the brim b) it starts to seep back into the house' foundation/basement c) redo everything but this time pipe it to a proper storm drain d) install a sump pump inside that well and pump the water into neighbor's lawn...
I miss Roger
Lol they put it right beside someone else's house
7 years after installation then what?
Mahk should do home improvement videos. “This Old Townie”
Rubba Hamma!
I never seen nor understand this video ever!!!
Cities need to man up and provide storm water drainage
why are the holes facing up??
That pop-up isn't going to do anything.  The inlet is lower that the pop-up so water would just back up into the pipe.
That was not 8 inches from grade
Works great if your yard drains the right way.
it's better to put pipe first and then the rocks on top right?
Lots of pipe goin' in 6 inches...LOL
big f#cking job just to get rid of wadda !
Just playing this out in my head:  if the plastic barrel/bucket/dry well sump fills up to the point where the pop up emitter has to open to provide relief, isn't the 4" PVC pipe already completely underwater and therefore the pipe is backing up before it gets said relief?  (the top of the 4" pipe is a few inches below the emitter... i'm thinking  an outlet pipe on the side for overflow would be better IF it can be sent to the surface.. anyone have experience with this system??
I do not recommend installing the perforated pipe on the feed line to the drywell. If roots get into it, the whole system is useless.  Instead feed the drywell with solid pipe, and then come out of the tank with a second or even third pipe that is perforated.
For this project, can anyone guess how much stone was used? 1/2 ton? 1 ton?
I assume the drywall shouldn't hold water very long if installed properly as shown? Should the drywell be deeper to avoid the possibility of freezing or is that overkill? TIA! I'm looking to tackle this project this weekend so any advice is greatly appreciated.
But but.... WHY??
When it comes to outdoor drainage, is it better to use pvc pipe or corrugated pipe?
if you are going to run water away from your house make sure it's directed to your neighbors yard so you can have water wars
u ever put a drain like that by my fence gate, I’ll spray foam your Fukn downspouts closed
Would this be okay in Ohio? like it was freezing all last week then now it’s 55 and rainy?
what about weather or something else causing the pipe to be pushed up to the surface? or freezing during winter?
Is it me or did they just send that water to his neighbors yard?
Hahahahaha yes away from his house and into his neighbors!
Is the lid covered in landscape fabric before back filling?  Where can you buy them black dry wells
uh that's why it's green.. 🤨🙄
Do you put fabric on the bottom of the hole?
Why?  Heavy rain and you have a flooded yard.  I know every part of the country have its moments when there is 3 days of rain.  Connect the down spout to a French drain and get it to the curb for the storm drains to take over
Maga
Very good video lads
why would you put it right in front of the fence gate
How much roof can one of these handle?
umm thats why its green
What about how he said wrap it waap it.
And what happens when the system backs up
How much stone do you need for this project?
😩😢😢😢😢 a question pls  I bought house with no driveways,  now the driveway done all the water down into backyard  ( yes it lower  then the  house or else I flooding every week ) behind it block with the humb so water got no where to go  ,,,, can I put alot of fine  stones & dirt mixed & leveling it hight up as a level of the house  ,because now it very low that how water stay there took 4 day to dry out  sometimes not dry out yet then rain  again 😡💔 I suffered house no man around sorry of  my English so poor  Thanks for your to answering me 💜
I wanna see ya go deepa
He did not put the pipe hole deep enough and at 3:27 Rodger Roasted him
They only hooked up one downspout for that big dry well?
Those holes are a waste of time. roots will just get in it and clog it all up
If you are in the neighborhood of East Windsor CT  we are at 17 Cricket Road
Hi Roger this is Mike from CT we have a high water table where we live Janeski came out to install a freeze guard and piping to a drain runoff at the end now we have water running into our yard and neighbor s yard I was thinking about installing a storm drain at the end of the runoff to catch the water & redirect the flow of water toards the woods and river behind our house  and install a drywall what's your take on this
I've installed dry Wells and usually I try and make sure that the water table is below the foundation of any nearby house do not have water being on a table seeping into any foundation
"Gonna run that waata across your yaaad"
What kind of landscape fabric do you recommend? Would plain old weed blocker fabric work?
Fuk all that...Cant you just run the pipe into the street or neighbors or down a hill
I have multiple wells and there are blocked off by the previous owner. Going to use a jetter to see if i can unclogged them. My hope is slim due to the two big massive trees in the front yard.
2:30 => what she said
Now grab the RUBBA HAMMA.
"what's next?" uhhh, your engineer, plans and permits...
I've always loved THIS OLD HOUSE
3:27 Yup, you sure think of everything.. how do you replace it when it inevitably gets chopped to shreds by the lawn mower.
Loads of dumb responses here by people who have trouble reaching their own shoelaces.
LMAO .. 6' next to the neighbors house! Great neighbor. 👎
Still unsure what wadda is just confused a little
but why did they place the dry well in-front of a auto gate?
Good video but I would put the holes towards the bottom. If they are at the top, the water must fill up inside the pipe before it filters out. Holes point down brah - water percolates quicker mmkay?
instead of wasting the rain water why not put in an underground water tank and automatic irrigation system to irrigate the garden with it and use the water also for flashing the toilet and doing the laundry?
Looks too deep from here. Ground water may puddle around the pop-up and rain water from the lawn will end up filling the well. There should be a slight slope *away* from the well...
Stop bitching and keep digging!😂
I drank a shot of JD every time he said "waada" and I'm smashed.

would've liked to see this simulated with a hose or how it actually works in a rain storm.
Hmmm, it would be a lot easier to just run the pipe to the edge of the neighbor's yard.
So got a question my question is is this a good product for a cold climate in other words a warm cold warm cold climate will it withstand a Minnesota winter without cracking or breaking would appreciate a response back thank you
Will the stones enter the holes on the dry well?
i don't put water into my dry well so its 100% dry all year round. (PROTIP)
Fill with gasoline, the perfect booby trap
did you just drain the water right in front of your gate? There are going to be puddles, aren't they?
No clean out?
I think the popup valve is to deep once they level the lawn ?
Let's put it right in front of the gate so we can run it over.
The garbage from the roof (particles of shingles, small debris from the trees, etc) will come into the drain pipe and into the dry well. They will be accumulated there and finally will clog it. If a dry well is under the ground, how to clean it?
Dry well are useless.  All they do is fill up with water and then it percolates out the top and then you're back where you started with a flooded yard.
Lol it's just a basic septic system leach field
in winter its solid ice all cracked n broken..frozen solid..back up beside foundation... 10.000$ foundation repair... crapppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
you could use infiltrator chambers as an alternative.
After all of this, you didn't place the dry well correctly.  8" is supposed to be from the top of the dry well to the top of the release cover.   You put the top of the well RIGHT at grade?
Those spades without a top handle would be useless with our tough clay soil here in England.
That pop-up valve (at 3:20) is not going to pop up when its under 5 feet of snow.
I had water coming into my basement due to an overflowing gutter. The previous homeowner installed a PVC drain but just ran it directly into the soil. Dead end. I followed these instructions to do the same job. Worked great. Great drainage.
is that NDS well
bo
Just did it in my backyard, awesome works great guy's helped alot.
Just what I was looking for. Thanks a lot.
you boys need a sharp shooter ,lot faster.Well done on the fabric with pipe.
My local supplier is telling me that anything stronger than 4 inch corrugated pipe is overkill.  I'm not so sure.  What type of PVD pipe did you use?  How much per foot?
that's a lot of hard work, looks exhausting...
that's great job honestly
