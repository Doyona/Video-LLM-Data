Didn't Michael Jackson sleep with kids? Kind of "Bad" taste if you ask me. Couldn't you find a different record sleeve?
How bout a sleeve for a triple gate fold lp ie; Elton john “goodbye Yellow Brick Road”
Nice gatefold sleeve but there's still a chance the record may slip out from the side. Can it be stored inside the 13"x13" sleeve (or anything bigger)?
Just received these in the mail and to be honest they are manufactured poorly. The measurement of these are very bad. Many of the new gatefold albums are using a thicker cardboard stock and these are not fitting properly.  Also, if your a jazz collector and your purchasing some of the tone poet albums from Bluenote and trying yo use this.... forget it. Very disappointed.
These look good in the video. I just ordered 50.
With these sleeves, can you store the vinyl outside of the album cover?
Do you make gatefold sleeves for 45 rpm jackets?
3:14 I'm glad I'm not the only one who pushes sleeves into their polybags using their stomach.  These bags are awesome, just have to find the money to buy 300 of them and the time to swap bags on 300 gatefolds, haha.
Anyone in the U.K. bought the archive gatefolds? What did you think and how much import tax did you get hit for?
Those Mylar ones look absolutely amazing!
I love to try out the armour if you have free samples
Do you have triple gatefold sleeves. I have several albums that are the triple gatefold albums.
That's pretty clever, I'll be considering some of the Archival Armor.
Love em!  How much?
can you demo the mylar 4mm sleeves. Thanks
Need that product here in Chile, cheers
