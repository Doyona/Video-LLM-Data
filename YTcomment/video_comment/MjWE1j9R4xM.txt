Love and Respect for your leadership.
With those temps, I'll never want to go there... good looking cabin, great job, but y'all can have Canada... Lol! 🖖🏿😎👍🏿
Does anyone know if the 10 ×10 size is OK to build without a permit in Newbrunwick,  canada. Also can you build more then one structure?
I really like this. Will watch your other videos, hope to find some tutorials.
❤❤❤
Cool little cabin
What a great way to teach your children ❤
Hello Charles 🤗
I have always loved simple ❤I love you’re cabin
How much does it cost to put a bathroom in a shed?
If you get caught building this in a place that requires permits for ANY sort of building you're gonna get busted.  It's a structure it requires a permit.  Period.
It doesn't have to last a century, only the time which you would wish to use it and live in it.  The bark on the logs is lovely.  Nice job!
Crows most definitely remember faces
Man not for nothing,, you did a awesome job . you have a great heart my friend God Bless
Man "simplicity brings freedom" kinda hit me, did you have to buy the land for this?
I think it is great idea. The fact that you donated this cabin to the youth group of the church that owns the property was not only the right thing to do, it shows the content of your character. I commend you for building this cabin and it is my belief that any one of the friends you made during this build will use the example you set to continue the work you've inspired to build other cabins in that area for similar use. ❤❤
What a purposeful way to use one's life. Would you like to visit Germany and talk to the youth in our Church? We are a small church in the north of Black Forest and I just know the importance of mentoring the youth. "...Your word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my path..." (Psalms 119:105) Blessings from The German Black Forest... ❤🙏
Do you have another video building it ? Like step by step or something !
God bless you, sir. Stay the narrow way with Jesus. He too often withdrew to lonely places to be with the Father. It's good for the soul.
Looks great and functional you're living the dream keep it up man
Hellfire….a person couldn’t drive a damned fence post without a permit in this country of the US
Thanks to your resin door, I have just had the honour of witnessing 8 years of content, I sincerely thank you for sharing your journey with us. I am moved by your dedication and commitment, and by your artistry, and compassion. I am genuinely moved knowing you, and people like you, are in this world. Your grace through your struggles is inspiring.
Charles is a real friend
I think tax is ok. Just one tax, 10 percent of wage. But no other kind taxes, tax for food, for things, for land, for house, etc.
How much land/trees do you need to be able to harvest it sustainably to make sth like this and your bigger cabin?
"Simple offers freedom." These are wise words my friend.
Cracks in the  front door mother nature has the  simple solution .Mud!
I would love to have a piece of property that no one can tell you what to do!! We bought 5 acres in rural town but wow...the county permits and blah blah blah...you never own it,!! They're always telling you.....BS!!
donated to the church so the priests had a place to bring the little boys on a pelgrimage
charles was more saying: ''hello. Do you have food?'' lol.
Charles the crow definitely knew who you were. In fact He knew way more about you than you knew of him. They are very intelligent and pay close attention to detail. Great story
If I had a cabin like that I would never leave
"simple offers freedom"  Quite profound really
Oh I love you're cabin!
I watched your tribute to your dad.  He is still there with you watching over from above.  God bless you
10 x10 but how high can i go? also 10x10 what about steps? awning? will that be legal? or not legal
I hate crows, they kill other birds for no reason. But yes they are very smart and remember and recognize faces, if it was the same crow, he likely did remember you.
I am very sorry to hear about your dad's passing. I have been watching you and your dad build the cabin from the beginning. Remember the good and know he is still with you. God bless and again sorry to hear about your dad. I never had a dad and don't know what it's like to have someone to work and to teach you life.  Remember he is still there.
I love your cabin! What a fun and rewarding project! Charles is awesome and so is your heart!
What music is playing at the end of the video? I like it!
You did what? You donated it? Omg...unbelievable.
Cool cabin but my favorite part of the video is your story. I love that you work as a youth pastor. You had the kids help on your cabin. Then you donated you cool cabin to the church for the youth and others to enjoy. Your a good man the world needs more men like you....
You are wonderful asset that was given to us.  I have watched your videos on this cabin and the new one you recently build.  Truly a gift from our great lord.  Bless you and your family. 🏚❤️
The  people who talk crap and put down what others do, 99% of those don't have one a fourth as good or more than likely, nothing at all. They are called keyboard junkies.
mmmmmmmm, you’re a hot pastor. pity you’re married.....
How long did it take to build this? Great work!
Crows are highly intelligent and studies have shown they can indeed recognize and remember individual human faces. I have no doubt he recognized you.
What did you wear to stay warm?
💝😍😎👍
Congradulations I am proud of you son please do not let the world let u down or billie u for a person that needs a home out of the cold even god would say you did perfect and that is why he gave you the strength to finish the job and you did all on your own.have a happy holidays.stay safe and try to at least have some snacks laying around and water in case you get hungry lol.other than that enjoy your home.
Why didn’t you strip the bark from the logs?
I absolutely loved your story...and it's now 2021, when was the last time you checked on it ...
if i need tips all i do is look at the comments very helpful community
trudging through the snow with skinny jeans on and snow shoes is the most Canadian thing i’ve ever seen
Amazing! Forget what people think
You legend. You seriously solved homelessness?????
Good job people!
Crows never forget people
Absolutely enjoyed 💜so nice you donated it and let the kids help! New sub
This  in  good  area  and the  log  cabin  is  great  in  style!!!
Awesome job! I love it! Im thinking about building a cabin all by myself so this is very inspiring!
That was an amazing build especially for the first time.
How do you bear proof a cabin?
Sad to say in May of 2021, this log cabin would cost $10,000 at the current lumber prices at retail stores. I'm sure soon, they will make anyone logging or cutting down trees illegal due to the cost.
You should slant the ladder so it gives easier access to the loft. As to logging and log cabins, I feel their day is done, with all the problems forest firers have caused and all. The trees have to be given a chance to recover and not uses as timber for at least a generation.
felt like a documentary and was educational, thanks for the content
some of these off grid builds look fun. this one look like this  guy loves toruturing himself
much respect
Love it!
Only $500 huh hell I'll pay three thousand cash
Whats good love the idea
slop somr engine oil on it & it'll last alot longer
I love it..
2022
This long cabin is really beautiful and organized well for living in it even full time along with the cute crows who are really intelligent except for being near roads so yes Charles, Your Crow does know you!I have crows show up daily as I feed cats & crows in downtown area of little Nova Scotia town where I live, I would not trade this lifestyle though harsh long winters & blowing wind near this ocean town with about 9-10 weeks of summer!
I built a log cabin in Maine for 650 dollars back in 1972 over 40years before paper company decided to price it out of my range (lease)good  for you.I had squirrel steal an entire donut one morning, ermine stealing the necks of partridge,lots moose  ,  bear deer .26×28,with half loft,always in my heart
In these days off strife and struggling, simple sounds really good. I am really thinking about studying and learning how to live off the land in Northern Ontario Canada 🇨🇦.  Tired of the race and of course the "virus " that never seems to go away. If the Abarigional people who did it for hundreds of years, then as long as it is done right, anyone can do it. God Bless You All.
I bet Jesus is proud of you.
Alaska?
Add 40 years - the perfect man for me! Loved this video.
This is so frigging cool.
-50 below damn....how far north is this?
SO HUMBLING thank you for sharing!
Very nice
Man you cut so many trees and just left?! You need to learn from Russian man who uses only fallen trees and yet build fantastic cabin.
Don't worry I'm sure 7 11 or a walmart will be your next door neighbor.
Seems pretty simple to make, like stacking legos. I didn't really want to do the labor to make a cabin myself but with the ridiculous costs of small cabins it would definitely be worth it
Absolutely love it!
I love the Story of Charles great Video thank you for making
I like your vibe, my friend.  Chill, self-assured, comfortable with your person.  It's inspiring to see someone this confident in their path.
Awe! Don't you bog your mind with what others say... humans have to have something to nit pick and shoot down.. forget them.. I like the cabin! It's amazing!  Nice job! Don't you love when the local wildlife stop and say hello!  😍👍💜🤗 Bless you youngin! In Yahushua!
Of course he remembers you. Time only exists to humans.
great job, if you had the time you could have taken apart some old building that needed to be taken down for boards etc, a good money saver as well, my bro & i did this for a camp, a garage that someone didnt want, got for free, had it down in 7 hrs, used a power say to cut the walls in one full piece, saved us a tonne of cash, cheers
How could you move away and leave this... ????
This was awesome. What a great cabin. And butifull area. Just butful. GODS PROUD OF YOU.
I have always been jealous of the Canadians for that they have wood. Growing up in Northern Greenland and being a pro meat hunter there for 5 years, I could never find enough wood for a cabin. Had to use soil and stones. And Snow in winter of cause!. However, you get used to sleeping outside with the dogs too.
I no longer watch TV because of videos like this.
dig the guitar riff in the end : )
It's 10x20 buy 10ft high is the limit you don't need a permit in my area
Dope cabin. Love your economic choices.
Gaps means you're going to freeze. Not a criticism, a fact.
Great stuff.
I bet they loved that donation!
Fix the door it will be worth it
Wonderful project for a youth group, you can spread the skills and knowledge to another generation and they can pass it on again
simple??? hows a 58yr old single woman going to hoist those logs😳
I wonder if a lynx could kill a human if it tried to, that's a really nice log cabin also, looks pretty spacious actually. Thank you very much for showing us this. Sincerely Lorenzo gig harbor Washington.
Where is that located? Lands high in price
What a wonderful cabin! I lived in a 16x24 ft cabin for years. Heated with wood. Finally built another tiny home next to it and had a water well drilled so that both homes could have toilets and running water. A previously-homeless but very hard-working lady now lives in my tiny cabin next door. I'm getting old, and she does all the outside work, and is a Godsend. I had a stalker for 3 years, so there is a 6-ft-high chainlink fence around both homes. Now that the stalker died, the fence serves as a great dog park for my dog as well as my next-door-neighbor's dog.
*Your cabin is an absolute dollhouse, tarp roof, gapped door and all! It's quaint, cozy and serving it's purpose! WELL DONE*  ▶️▶️▶️▶️ I feed EVERYTHING: ants, squirrels, strays of all sorts.. that being said.. I posted a very short clip of myself communicating with a blind duck. I quack and he quacks and I continue quacking until he finds me in the park. I bring him treats like corn, crackers, breads, corn flakes...he loves it. I was told to "educate" myself , "youre harming the duck"!  Here's what I know to be wrong when feeding ducks bread or crackers... They fill too easily and there's little to no nutritional value.  They don't explode, get sickly or show signs of bowel upset. *it's the same as when we indulge ourselves with a nice treat like a cookie or ice cream cone* I feel that blinky , blind ducky, isn't training for the olympics so he'll be ok!  That being said- EVERYONE on youtube (especially) are filled with KNOW IT ALL info, there's ALWAYS going to be someone on here (and in life), that want to point out issues or flaws-, naysayers and killjoys!  I wonder what their log cabin looks like?
where abouts in northern canada
Crow was probably waiting for you to come back, evidently he knew you were here.
PERFECT I love it! when can I move in? hehe!
you should get some cat food for your Lynx neighbors in those hard times.
How do i legitimately buy land for good deal in the USA? Preferably out in the woods but not super far from grocery stores etc
Is that just moss and mud that is in between the logs?
I dit the same with a log (Good old man power), didnt think about it... Now my back hurts since 3 Years now and dont get better :-( i cant even lift a small stone when its on the ground :-( I hope nothing like this will ever happen to u
Just Beautiful 👌
Ah 2014, one hell of a Winter
Is the overhang counted with the feet or is it part of the roof?
This has got to be somewhere in Canada
Project not pro ject.
Do you have the plans for this cabin? If so, would you post/sell them? Young guy here looking to build his own!
Bitching great job
Ummm pasta...
I don’t see any fault with your cabin..I’ve seen far worse, all of which have perfectly served their purpose..2 quid tine of brown waterproof silicon would fix the draughty from the door..but it would take away some of the rustic appeal..beautiful work..awesome cabin 👍🙏🏻
Global warming!
I wish this one was true in Ontario
You have an amazing skills to build a house.  I enjoyed watching.
Why you have to put the windows so high in the house? Now your house looks ugly from inside.
Nice cabin
2.9K people still like to  take mortgages)))
I would have loved seeing a fire in the wood stove.
charles is a Chinese goverment spy
Much better than the native American plywood or tin shacks that government approves for tax free indigenous folks.
Good job 👍🏽
Simple offers freedom....hell yeah brother I like that
Wow amaxing offgrid
im a 5th generation carpenter, you did very well building that, cheers!
you could of at least explained whats in the title in the first 10 damn minutes ....ya know 500bucks and permit free and no i couldn't watch until the end because it was dreadfully boring so sorry ....it is YouTube ...get to the damn point lol ...just kidding ....but really would love to know ?
Love it! 12/31/2029
You could live in that if you want
Looks good.
Looks like freedom
Sweet cabin!
Great job ,with the complaints about the door gaps and tarp roof,Sounds like my wife watched this video lol.those people are ignorant morons, who probably couldn't even build the front door,on that cabin.Videos like this give me hope that one day ,I can ditch my fourteen hour work days,ditch my wife and kids,grab my hound Dog and hit the woods.lol
No entiendo lo que quiere decir. Que no permiten permiso? O que no hace falta permiso? Y su precio es de 500 € más o menos?? Por favor póngase en comunicación conmigo. Si es así. Gracias 🙏🏻
No doubt all the naysayers will be out crying foul. Kudos for making the cabin and the video, not many people actually get round to project delivery.
Can anyone explain why he did not skin the trees?
Where in Canada are you?  I’d love to do the same in Ontario.  Great work !
You guys did an amazing job.  God bless you and keep making beautiful things! 🙏🇺🇸❤💪
Good job and awesome mtns  . I built a man home in the Colorado Rockies it wasn't so simple kinda wish I had gone the more simple route because it turned out with being a single dad taking me very long from stopping it many times. God bless and happy trails.    :)
I think that's wonderful teaching kids those kinds of skills.  The public schools fall short they should be taught fixing simple plumbing, electrical fixtures.
How could you see the lynx's footprints over your prints unless you went back?
There's alot of thumbs down, but I don't see how. I absolutely love it.
Maybe someone already asked this and I missed it. How far off did you built the outhouse and was it also made from logs? My husband and father-in-law build a log cabin but the outhouse was regular lumber store wood so it did not hold up over the years like the cabin.
Props brother. Great job.
Cud you buipd me one I'd pay double
I wish i could be there to help u🙂🙂
In Australia, you would have paid $500 for the tarp.
Charlie was only waiting for this moment to arise
Дом будет очень холодный, щели огромные
Happy for you, but not in America. Cost much more...
Very nice sir
Anyone know the song ? Playing at the end of the video ?
Thank you for showing the snowy cold world which I probably never can visit in my life.  From a Japanese lady in down under
So cute!!
Bugs?
Makes me wonder if I could build a giant house with a 10' x 10' base(s), but bigger upper floor(s)...without a permit.  I don't NEED to do that, but it'd be fun to mess with my local municipal overlords.
Praises to Yah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth! Who gave His Son, Yahoshua ‘Yah is Salvation’ Messiah to sweat blood and be brutally murdered on a stake and be resurrected on the third day for the sins of all of humanity! The proper spelling of ‘Hallelujah’ is HalleluYah, which means ‘praise to Yah’! Yah is a jealous Êl, so jealous that He doesn’t even want the names of deities/idols/mighty ones to come to our lips! Praises to Yah for your skills! I pray that Yah blesses the world with wisdom, knowledge, understanding, strength, compassion, humility, love, patience, and endurance to do what is right in Yah’s eyes, in the Mighty Name of Yahoshua ‘Yah is Salvation’ Messiah, Amen! HalleluYah!
Excellent work mate! Hope the kids love it. 👍
I admire your work ethic and way of life good job bro
In northeastern Ontario we are only allowed to build any building structure but has to be torn down after 28 days on Crown land .
Very good👍
Freedom would be living there, year round. Chopping wood. Harvesting the wildlife to eat. Nice idea , but not freedom by any means. Making great friends , enjoying the moment fantastic, but does not tell the riggers of surviving like this. But still 2 thumbs up for teaching youth self confidence, in enjoying nature. You can never go wrong doing that.
muy buena !!!
I'm a very new subscriber. How many cabins have you built?
Beautiful!!!
Endccp.com Falundafa.org 999999999999
Lucky you, it's beautiful! The cabin, the scenery, everything!
The older I get, the more I prefer a simple life.
😘
I am stoned. I have a 2 acre parcel on the Mississippi Gulf. Flooded in Katrina. I could use a small footage, no permit cabin there too, I bet.
Very nice.
This dude be reading it like it’s a middle school presentation
Beyndim çok
👍👍👍❤❤❤
Is the land yours too?
Outstanding!
This has always been a dream of mine. Sadly I am in a wheelchair now, but even so, I believe I can do all things through Christ......Stunning location. I have never been to Canada-always wanted to. I 'm a huge fan of Catch The Fire Toronto. I would love this. Living off the land. I am one of few people who gets excited at the first flakes of snow. I am the child who never grew up especially when it snows!
Exciting! I love it! I Would live in it💖✨
God bless you in your journey!
Nice job. It looks wonderful.
Nice job.
No permit required  Aka- out on public land well off the beaten path.
pretty nice for the cost, one thing though............... you should carry not so much because of bears but because of people.
WHERE
Great cabin! Great work!
Good job looks great 👍
How is it possible that someone Owns everything! It’s my land I’ve had hands for 18 years and your telling me i can’t use them to build a structure for me and my family that’s over 100sf without paying to use them. I’m honestly sick about it
Charles reminds me, l looked after a pair, throughout the Winter, for 7 years, until l moved. The original one would call me, from a lamp post, his mate which came after the first year, was more cautious, but we all got along.
That looks like fun to do. All I need is a vehicle with a safe enough heated sleeping space after being parked, a chainsaw and a pair of snow shoes then to do the same if I can learn ahead of time to adjust being alone without a land line and a computer and a cell phone all of the time because lifting weights has far more to do with using your brain than the sum total of your muscle tissues.
That voiceover is so cringe
Damn nice job on your building skills and video sharing ! Thanks Brada! I agree with the other fella down below /.... what’s up with the others grinding down a mans peaceful way of sharing his well accomplished project ?! I give ya a thumbs up and a fair warning...... I’m stealing some of your MOJO and getting my dairy air up to the back part of my 20 acres and building one similar for an air BNB ! Thanks bro !!
The log cabin is so beautiful I would  love a cabin like that !
Nice job and what a great education for those lads.
Liked Your Video very much..! All the Best to You 👍

Good Enough Is Good Enough !
God bless you ALL!! Jesus is 👑 AMEN
This video would be so much cooler if it wasn’t coming from an actual robot. Like come on dude, put some emotion in your voice. 😂
Great video thanks again
Would the styrofoam insulation work with asphalt tiles in place of metal?
How does this cabin look today????
Thank you for saying “manpower”. In this politically correct world, that’s refreshing to hear.
Hard back breaking work, eat well and take care.
Simple offers freedom. True dat!
For as long as you don't have to pay for taxes or any other governmental requirement is good like the good old days. It's hard life then but its freedom & it worth lot more than anything.
Amazing cabin very well done
It's a great video.calming your narration is very calming
I have a question where is the toilet ?
Don't like your sponsor pro j  Biden
Totally absurd to ask permission in a free country to live free ! But ask your city,  and they will direct you to your atm !
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.
Good stuff !! Just subbed 👍🏼👍🏼
This is what young white guys do.  I think it's a much better life choice than B L M protesters of looting burning and killing in good centers / Cities they don't have the skills to rebuild them.   Sad.
My great grandfather rescued a baby crow he named Horace and kept it until he died. It was like an inside/outside cat. He had a cage with no gate and left it beside the open kitchen window. Horace would leave for months at a time but would always come back to winter. That is still the smartest bird I’ve ever known. I swear he mourned pops’ death. When he came back and couldn’t find pops my grandfather left the window open and seed in the cage but he just flew around to every windowsill looking for pops for a few days and then he flew off and didn’t come back. I often wonder if he ever swoops down into some other old folks’ open kitchen windows looking for a scratch and a sunflower seed.
It’s like brooks and jake
Round windows man, it makes it instantly nicer to look at.
I wanna know where this is
Have you finally made the front door(aka table) draftproof? If yes what did you use?
Great channel
I dont care what anyone says , you built awesome cabin by yourself.
Nice job.
All of these videos brought me to a conclusion to build my own darn house in one of the Alaskan/Canadian forest. I think I'll make an A-frame cabin a little further North. These videos are so inspirational that anyone can beat their dreams into live events!
Charles made me hit the like button
Thumbs down for cutting down those trees!
I love it you did a great job that’s amazing for 500 bucks cheapest fun you’ll ever have
Love the design as for the bears always keep your 44 snub nose handy for close encounters! Take care.
this man really out here playin minecraft on us
I admire everything about you that it took to invest all the time and energy to build this little cabin. I'm also watching you build the bigger one. Totally love it.  Are there more episodes after you build the first dormer? I can't find it.
It's adorable. I love it.
2.7K people are stupid and like their money being stolen
😀👍

雪国の玄関は２重ドアーがいいですよ　外気が入りこまない‼️
My little lesbain brain said yes
Love the narration style.  Sounds a lot like Marty Stouffer’s “Wild America” back in the day on the old tube. Makes the video a lot more interesting 👍🏼
This is cute. Great job!
Very nice cabin.   And very nice thing to do for the young people.
May God bless you for your work as a youth pastor!
That’s a great little cabin. I love it. You did a great job.👍🏼
I bet they did
This is a real cool cabin i like all of what you have been doing in all of the videos i have seen so far nice workman ship and so fourth
Those links are click baiting shit. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Even care what your mama thinks?
Mr. Bear will tear those designer jeans off your hide doesnt want your tea cups son!
Wow nice work Pastor!😊 I'm so happy I came across your channel. May God richly bless you all the time brother!😊
those snowshoes show me why i like x country skis better than shoes--personal preference :)
I think it's cool that you donated the cabin to the church. I'm guessing you could go back there anytime you want to?
The part with your crow reminds me of the story of Prophet Elijah, a crow visited him too everyday, he lived high up in the mountains and the crow brought him bread to eat
Im glad to see that our Father is bringing more of His children back to simplicity, nature and out of the pattern of this world - Babylonian Matrix. This is a beautiful and well made cabin, I hope to build it one day if the Father permits it and I can buy some land by the forest. However for now, Im thinking of a yurt. May Jah bless you and mold you to be His faithful servant for His glory.
Donated to the church? Uhmm, it’s on church property!
Aaah So nice and peaceful looking and also it's too cute that you found a friend in Charles ✌🏽💙
It’s like a real life Lincoln log house
Nice. i lived in a cabin similar size for 8 years. life was good n smple. now i have 2 houses n buncha krap i dont want or need. evryday i dream to return to that life, that is when i was happy.
I love this so much!! I have a dream of building my own cottage and living off the land. Farming and gardening and such... free of fluorescent lights and 9-5s. I'm still in high school though so I can only plan. Thank you for this video and I love the cottage!
Log buildings are chosen by people who wish to live in harmony with nature, who respect nature and wish to live their life to the fullest https://www.filwud.com/en/
Hi Matt.... If you have been following the story about he's log cabin , he actually tells us that it is he's grandfather's land. That's why it could be the reason he doesn't pay rent , & or anything else you mentioned in your comment Matt. Cheer's , have a good day.
I wish i stuck in this hut with my girlfriend
Wow all those thumbs down by couch potatoes who more than likely couldn’t build a dog house lol I think this young man is just awesome
Dont be lazy, take the bark off. Youll have a cabin full of all kinds of insects for at least 2-5 years if you leave that in.
Aye can you build me one?
God bless you for doing that
It looks great  I wish I had one so bad
This man be doing Minecraft tutorials in real life.
Damn, if you had a very good supply of food and fuel and could hunt and fish this would be a great place to lay low for this terrible Coronavirus depression we are just entering. Just need a good partner and some first aid and medical supply too
You are outstanding!!!  I love being out in the wild...  Do you get to live there at all???  Simple is always best and wow you spent so little on this wonderful get away!!!  Have fun
Camera? You better have some guns up in there.
Did u purchase this land or did u homestead this? Surly u pay taxes and or insurance? Or is it considered “off grid”? I love it sir. What a gr8 job. Wish was younger! I could have done this...not now...to old! Love it, I really do!
Great project, especially that it involves youth, they need to get out there and actually be involved physically with a concrete project.  It help young adults build confidence in themselves (pun intended), realise the world is not just about consumerism, online presence, and popularity.
I'd like to ask family and friends to build one on my property.
Nice how ide do it.your way.
Nice simple cabin....well done....its a great experience.....being from northern ontario this is like being home!
How can you build such a thing for 500 dollars?
Build me one please.  I'll pay you 3 grand and the cost of all materials lol
When one is quiet , silence speaks .
Me and my friend are building a house in the woods we’re trying to figure out a way to do it bc we don’t have money
2:46 these lines are beautiful
I like it I think it’s perfect just the way it is and as long as you’re happy with the way it turned out who cares what other people think. We can’t make everyone happy no matter how hard we try it just won’t happen. There is always someone who isn’t happy with anything which is really sad. Because we all deserve to be happy and loved.
Good job on the cabin nice word
You need a dog companion
WHY WOULD YOU CABIN OUT THERE DO YOU JUST NOT FEEL THE COLD OR SOMETHING
I love that you turned a coffee table into a door. That is so awesome!
who dislikes this stuff? Like seriously why?
That’s way rad!
It's perfect.
Ke buen video
500$ didn't include you labor charge!
I guess the past 5 years has enabled you to weld bigger logs and navigate narrow boards to build your latest project, huh?
Guys, he said $500. That's Canadian so about $92.50 USD
Alaska??
Nice job!
who dislikes this video?????
Good day A . Went camping last week end . Wood stove ,LP lights , only 14* out side last Saturday . Put 29 miles on my grizzle went thru some fire wood and beer . Had a great time with friends . Cold out houses suck but if that’s the only draw back I’ll take it.
These are a lot of fun to watch.  Some nights when my mind is racing with the days worries and I can't sleep, I imagine myself in the bush building a simple cabin, and somehow it relaxes me and I drift off...
DOPEEEEEEE
A crow from the UK just passing by...great project, well executed and within budget. 👍
10' x 10' is ridiculous. Okay for one night, we have such cabins on walking trails for tourists in Tasmania where it is beautiful and snows. You can have a fire, must keep it clean  ( and leave it as such) then move on. It's free overnight accommodation for hikers. But no-one would live in such a small place.
The bird is a RAVEN.
This man has so much wisdoms to offer on top of practical abilities.  GOD IS ALSO HIDE HIMSELF IN SIMPLICITY.  MOSES IS ONE MAN INVASION OF EGYPE AND BROUGHT OUT 2 MILLIONS FOR GOD! SIMPLICITY MINDED IS EASIER FOR GOD TO DEAL WITH RATHER THAN HIGHLY EDUCATED (TOO MUCH BELLS AND WISELS)
I really don't understand all the dislikes on these types of videos... Why? Because one man used a small amount of wood?
Gee, I thought this was a video about building a log cabin... Turns out it's just a recap of the wildlife living near your log cabin...
My favorite video.I love simple 👍
If you can find an old billboard it works better than a tarp and should be free.
Doors fine! Ruffs fine! Foundations fine! All together perfect!
I hope you get to the cabin, start a nice fire, do some wood work with an ax and a hand saw...just small chores, nothing too big. If you have a dog that would be cool, but anykind of pet will do...even a fish although, mostly people like dogs! Also, cook a nice meal, how about steak and potatoes! I can't wait to get my cabin in the wood and do small jobs while it is snowing...I'll recored everything, post it on youtube and I'll be famous! Just like you.
You can make it unsafe as you want, because the land is yours too on paper when the contract over within a few years.
In Vancouver I saw a crow with a large nut, flying back and forth dropping it on the road to crack it open.  Suspiciously intelligent crows hanging around.
I keep expecting Kevin Costner to ride up on his horse. Tu Tani Tanka O Wachee. Get your solar panels finished and your good to go.
Awesome job
There is a pattern that the Food and Drug Administration is not really looking at. Tom Mower biologists since the 70s billionaire in the 80s is a wear for his family's concerned. The corner of the iceberg is toxic in our personal care and home care products, garbage in garbage out. Family-owned company, Toxicfreeamericasisel.net
AWESOME!
I like the cabin but I would like to ask a question when you were showing pictures of the cabin there was a white( what looked like an old propane tank) hanging by the stove pipe. May I ask was that converted for making hot water?
I would love a home like this....
It's a great build
👻👍, crows are so cool.🇺🇸
They say that crows can remember u for up to 3 years.  I bet Charles did know u😊
Where do you plug in your computer...? 🧐
Fantastic....cabin young man..Kudos to you and your values
all from real trees..does that means they have some kind of bugs in the tree?
Such complex blueprints! Ha ha ha! Kudos to you. Yes, too bad you didn't debark the timbers but hey! You can do that over time, right? 😁😁😁 And no wonder you were able to build it mostly by yourself. With all those energy drinks, you would have made a squirrel look slow! Ha ha ha! Great job!
Nice!
It’s great
Please share the following information at your next youth meeting. Serial Killer Overlords: Darkest Secret Revealed https://www.bitchute.com/video/49qlIKYTyUOi/
Nice work, man....!!!  I am planning to bild one for my self. Thanks and all the best !
find fault?     meh!   life’s too short to be picky.  live it to its fullest!!   great job!!
nice cabin.... :)
where did you build this cabin???
In your excellent video, you mentioned some viewers made critical  remarks about the build. It's been my experience such people often have a great deal to say, but subsequently one discovers that they have never attempted building a cabin themselves. It's a well known fact that it is so much easier to tear down than it is to build.  In my view the cabbin: turned out really well; it was a pleasure to have tour, and you can definitely be proud of your achievement. Thanks for sharing your ideas and skills. Best wishes to you. :)
It looks front heavy
Hey mate, you seem to have a hang up on what people think is correct and what's not... don't be, you have done a fantastic job with very limited resources.dont be paying heed to the negative crap that some people throw at you... keep up the good fight.... I'm a little envious.... fair play Pall
Awesome job and you are so amazing. Thanks so much for sharing this with me 💖 from texas
.... there's cheap bullets for the bear problem.
Act of 1871 and the two jurisdictions
I just came to see a 500$ cabin build, but here I go- DUDE, you’re a freaking PASTOR!!!! A TEACHER!!!! Why are you teaching these kids to work on Sabbath? Saturday is Sabbath, nothing has changed with the Commandments, the church has. The 4th Commandment. The only one prefaced, “Remember.” (To keep the Sabbath holy, on it you shall do NO work)
"Simple offers Freedom." " love that.
i HOPE NOTHING FRISKY HAPPENS IN THAT CABIN...
I like it... Just get a snow machine out there u wood be set ... Good job 👍 spot on
That is so cool that story about the crow Charles.
I love your log cabin and so does my son. He is 17 and he said he would love to have a log cabin like yours. Job well done.👍🏻
Simply putting down and building on top of a plastic Tarp would save you years of potential Rot having someting between your bottom logs and earth they sit on. Also could've put a laquer on bottom logs or burning them to seal off before building...
почему не ошкурил лес сгниет быстро
this video just made me colder than i already am.
12:04 BRO SLENDER MAN IS IN YOUR CABIN!!!! lol
All that matters is what it is to you.  It's sweet!
Oh God he's Abit dullllllll
Pro-ject
You should put your cabin up on AirBnB. I’ll bet you get some takers.
what happens with charles?
"Complicated offers bells and whistles... Simple offers freedom..."
Nice video!
I like it you could have used a tire foundation I thought you could legal do 10 by 13. Crows are smart they will even tell other crows witch human helped them you should have made it 15 feet tall with a basement it be like a mini mansion
"Watch out where them huskies go don't you eat that yellow snow" 9:50 -Frank Zappa
I have been drowning for couple of years and I exactly give my left hand to live a palace like this...perfect job my friend...hope to be free one day...
Awesome!!!😊
You should be PROUD to have created that wonderful cabin..  ANYONE, who put thumps down, just have issues and a sad LIFE ...Great job!
Children's Youth Group cabin stays are invaluable;  they will remember this fondly all their lives.
I love simple. Great build!!
Looks like Alberta Canada in August
I hope by now that you have brought in a 5 gallon bucket full of seeds for Charles... So you can give him a few handfuls when he makes his daily visits... thanks for great video and God bless!
Why...did 2.5K people have a problem with this video? That's more proof of my long standing theory: People are just dicks.
I'm so READY.  Kids all grown, it's just me and  my beautiful Creator. I do believe any thing can be fixed if given the tools to do the job. Any body up for for adventure with no rules.
That crowe ❤️
I would love to have a cabin like that about hunting is hunting pretty good there
Did you have to buy that property or can anyone find property and build it
Very nice and cozy hut you made dude. Love to spend holidays in such accommodations. 👍 Best wishes from RK Telangba Creations, India 175133
You know it's funny you talk about the crow name Charles when I built Custom Homes in Texas we had a blue jay show up one day when we started a new home and he would stand up on top of the walls and just talk at us all day long and then he started coming down on the floor when we would eat lunch and we started to throw him a crumb of food here a crumb of food there the next thing you know he was right down there with us every time it break hanging out like one of the fellas he stayed with us all through that house and through the next one till the weather changed and then he was gone one day we really missed him after that in the old expression goes you never know where there's an angel or who is an angel ,so be careful how you treat them. God bless you and your family near and far
Marie Reyes
I JUST LOVE THIS CABIN, I’M PRAYING FOR ONE, I WANT ONE SO BAD. ONE DAY I’ll HAVE ONE
I love your cabin! It’s beautiful.
I want to stay there if only for a week or two and will help work on it plus will be glad to pay. Please contact me.
Of ALL THE COMMENTS I READ.... Not One single one mentioned what the name of the song was at 11:15... Wtf???? That's annoying!!!!! I always thought it was a fair copyright usage law to post that??
He stole the crow part from Shashank Redemption
You built a beautiful cabin
F  libtards
"...even if he is an old crow."  lol
Not bad......good for you, if you want to live like a roach, freezing your ass off.
Right on
-20 and he opens a window.......... He is actually a Raven. And in Norse mythology they are the messengers of Odin
I love seeing man commune with nature, animals and the wilderness. I am the same way, the solitude, the relationship with the outdoors and the self sufficiency. I love it.
Fuck the nitpickers. Great cabin.
Absolutely damn nice work on that build...ignore the critics.
Nice work.
I have a home in heaven. Life is short.  Death is real.   NeedGod.com
Thanks for sharing your work, and the story. It's perfect in every way my friend.  For those that understand, no explanation is necessary. For those that do not, none will suffice.
It's perfect! Thanks for sharing this.
i see more than 500 $$$$$$$.just in the precut seasoned wood and the couch and its on private LAND how much money did that cost..Your church owns the land go figure..and your a pastor...WTF..you live in a bubble of church money just cause you speak so called gods word..THIS is a FUCKING JOKE.....
I'm making one soon wont be as nice but itll keep me warm in these rough winters got no choice..
I would love to have a place like this... can you help?
LOVE THE PURE CLEAN TRUTH.GOD GIVES WHAT WE NEED,THE MORE THINGS WE ADD TO OUR LIVES THE MORE THATS IN THE WAY.IVE GOT FOUR OR FIVE TIMES MORE THAN I NEED.STORY,PUT A COIN IN A MILK JUG,THE MONKEY WILL GRAB IT AND BECAUSE IT WILL NOT LET GO OF IT,THE BOTTLE IS STUCK.REV.WATTS
All i can say is you did a good job on building a log cabin.other negative comments for finding faults is simply a “jealousy”keep up da good works and if made you happy just continue 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Very nice!
B Free my Friend. Enjoy ur Life 2 the Max; We only have 1. God Bless u n, B SAFE.
7:35 Are the Ketchup chips included in the $500
Now thats amazing. Teaching thee young skills as well. Bravo, and God Bless You.
I know this is really old but goodness those last few pictures were crazy.  That's one heck of a snow load having that poly underneath it all on that pitch.  Must've been glued
Id definately give up internet to live there!! Nice cabin, hard work and a strong mind pays off.
Can I buy it? I wanna live there.
WILL MISS YOU PROFESSIONALISM
THAT'S GOOD NO PERMIT JUST BUY YOUR LAND,I TO WANT TO GET A PIECE LOVE ADVENTURE.
Praise the Lord
Five million views for an investment of $500 on the cabin.  That's 100 views per cent or 10,000 per dollar.  Impressive.
What kind of trees do you use?
how can i hire someone to make me one of these?
U have to take off the bark of the logs. It traps water underneath and the logs will rott
Aahh perfect!! But do you have to pay for the land!!?  And what about sewer supplies??
Nice job. Simple but cool. His narration kinda reminds me of those old tv nature programs i remember watching as a kid. Very folksy.
If youre not on your land youre on somebody else's so no, nothing is this "simple" when it comes to a permit at least..
Which state/ country u able to
Wya for those rules on 10 by10ft
This is amazing
That was some hard work to build.  That's a great accomplishment and an awesome way to enjoy life!
Awesome
Reminds me of Dick Proenekke - Alone in the Wilderness
Despite how incredibly awesome I think this place is, having watched your most recent series, your skills have improved - or perhaps it's just more of a dedication to a more permanent structure. Anyway, appreciate all you do!
like the video alot until those setup camera you clearly placed and went back to walk for lol keep it real bro its much better...
Let the negativity fall wayside, you’ve built yourself something to cherish there, bud
Yo Charles is the real champ
So beautiful.
I also built a smaller cabin. My opinion about disposing of the door and loft window is very near yours.😂
Ain't nothing better than having a place to call home without taking any loans.
You're kinda like Dick Proenneke. Both are amazing. Thank you.
Very nice 👍
😄⛄🎄🎒
Love this, and your thoughts on everything 2💜💙..& Charles the crow💞
I believe you & my dad would have been friends. He always wanted to be in a cabin in the woods. He used to have property in Colorado & was building a beautiful one.
Yo! Dude you are an inspiration to lots of people so F*#K the nay sayers your generation needs more MEN like you! Keep making videos & ill keep watching!
Dont run your plywood vertically, there is more strength horizontally because of the wood grain
Crows are among the smartest birds in the world. And studies have shown that they can remember human faces for up to 5 years. So you would not be stretching the truth to say that it remembers you. In fact. You're probably right that it does remember you.
@70+  enjoyed this vid young fella, nice work & any naysayers are prob armchair critics 🇨🇦 hunter/ gather
It's awesome thanks for sharing
Good on you Brother!! And “GIDDAY!!” from Australia {Down Under}...& 2019!! 🙋🏼‍♀️🙌🏽✝️🔥🕊🥰👍🏽🐸🦋🦎🐊🦈🦘🐃🐪🤠
This free YouTube channel produces far better and more "watchable" enjoyable content than most cable networks I pay money for every month.. 👍👌✌
Excellent job!⚡️🌟🌟🌟👍🏻🌟🌟🌟⚡️
Good job man I think it's amazing I would love that literally
How did you learn to build that cabin? I would love to see how it was done. It looks beautiful.
Your voice is awesome. I also like the crow story. 😢
Doesn't matter where,when, why, or what for there will ALWAYS be the haters they have nothing better to do but troll the internet looking for victims to prey upon with there nasty comments and so forth, in the end it's you that you must please and you only so get your shit together and lets go on a bushcraft ride together, tomorrow !!!!!!!!!
Where in Canada are you Algonquin park area ?i
Man you should read audiobooks! Such a warm voice :)
Truly amazing
Where did you buy the logs, btw.
What a lovely story about the cabin and the crow, Charles. I hope you see him again. That is amazing that you made that for $500.
Sig Sauer says simple is good ...sig
I live in Upstate New York and it would be ridiculous to expect that you could walk in there and expect to have fun and relax and enjoy your time with the snow shoes and not wear snow pants / Gators you're going to end up so bro what are you thinking come on now your professional nice job at the shelter / cabin / / Bug out location it looks fantastic I love it but you going to die of hypothermia
Blessings to you pastor......being a youth pastor is quite a calling. The world needs more God loving servants such as yourself
"simple offers freedom"  well said
Lynx and Bears 😣Dangerous place to live
$500 How Sway!🤯
I just want to say that for the amount of money spent, you have a beautiful cabin. It's the right size and I think the door is perfect
You could put some plywood over the door and that should keep out the draft.
Crows do recognize what they've /who've they've seen before and they do hold a grudge and most certainly will attack an aggressor. Great job and place brother. God bless.
I think it’s cool.....
Like the cabin in the woods, not the 0-
Do you have to own the land to build one it out there? Never mind you answered it lol
are u ever going to fin the other cabin ,u put up one log last week none this week lol
Hey haven‘t you Stayed for the Night?
I know this is an old video, but for current (2019) watchers....there may be no regulations a 10x10 or less structure...THIS one in the video would be considered larger when taking the loft into consideration...if it were just a porch ceiling or even unfinished loft then it wouldn't matter, but the fact that it is used as sleeping quarters means you have to use the correct ceiling (now floor) joists, and the area of that would be included in the square footage, while the length and width would be added to the buildings outer dimensions...all that said this WOULD need to follow any regs/specs or building codes, BUT with this cabin being so remote and probably doesn't even have an official address, then I'm sure he has never had any problem with inspectors or anyone of the sort...
Absolutely enjoy watching your videos, plus that cabin looks awesome.
How old are you, if you don’t mind me asking? You are a talented builder and great outdoorsman! Great job!
You really made an artful video.
I love it, I could live there year round. Just my dog n I
Nice work!
Great design. I love it.
I’m to lazy to set up my camera record myself walking away only to have to walk back for my camera 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
The crow was most likely seeing if you had any food scraps, being the only human out there, they are smart enough. you should have fed him some
2.3k people are some whiney ass liberals. Too scared to acually blister their hands for the walls that keep them warm.
😍I love this little cabin! It’s so awesome!  We have forty acres in Kentucky lots of timber, I’m hoping we build a cabin on our land from our own timber.
what is the name of that music , that is playing at 11:28
Great build
i built a similar cabin in NY  my dad had 100 arkers i had eleric  service  rain&snow for water  collected in 55 gal plastic drums free from work solal panels stored to 24 D8 battries from work (free good cores) 12v lighting.wood htr 1 cord lasts all winter   great deer hunting  in nov  a couple years back me& the miss  spent oct- mar there   on a grand in my wallet
Haters gonna Hate.
Keep up the good work brother, this world needs more like you.
Anyone else wanna know how he got the couches up there?
Love that build.. Great job..
Awesome !!!! ps if you get itchy you can always take some jacks ; move out some earth  and put in a stone footing ..of course that is probably old knowledge already deliberated ..great job
amen. that's awesome
Your door is shit mate
3:54 Does the 10 ft by 10 ft cover the base alone, or does it include the "footprint" of the roof?   6:47 What's the yellow gunk underneath your shoes?
you  can seal the door
dude, it's awesome............
“Pro-ject
Great experience and very cool. Thanks for sharing.
Inspirational young man, god bless from Australia 🇦🇺👍🏻
You have done just fine  love the videos and most of it is very useful. Keep it up plz
Hi I am a city person and may I ask a silly question? Where is the toilet?
Charles is a Raven not a crow.
No permit? Your church owns your cabin
Why all the thumbs down what it wrong with people? Been building long enough to say great job young man.
. Top & too small... .
Great job man !
Great looking construction on that cabin. But that door..... man. If I didn't know better i would claim someone else built it for you.
No permit? Why do you need “permission” to do anything on your own property? People need to STOP ASKING FOR PERMISSION TO DO ANYTHING ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY!
"Proh-ject." LOL
100 sq ft?  No offense, but my bathroom is twice that size.
I love this video. Want to do the same thing someday. It's sad you have to jerk proof your video by stating you have gaps in the door and used a tarp etc. Etc. As I too have a channel and people get so rude and nasty about the goofiest stuff. Great cabin and great narration! Well done! Enjoy!
You had me until the "youth pastor" comment.
Do you need to own the land for this type of stuff?
Does it have a bathroom and wifi?
Subscribed the moment after you said you were a youth pastor; whilst I muttered "you're a boss." God bless Outsider
Tuyệt vời
This is really impressive I wish to do something like this in the near future at low cost. I don’t see any flaws in the code of houses as long as it works it works
Your design works for me too Sir!
So many silly fruitgages living in citys giving thumps down. You little mothers "special child" do you know that you are killing many times more trees and wild animals by living in there then this man living in nature?
Who else found this video in there recommended ?
Hey how you doing buddy I follow you and you too a lot I'm a big supporter of keep on doing the great job I would like to ask you a question about a piece of property in Maine I have never built a cabin I want to build a cabin for the first time is going to be 10x10 nothing big I've been asking this question those cabins for me to live in it off grid I live in Miami Florida I don't have time to go back and forth you recommend me drying my logs for year for two years or just built the cabin how it is and let the logs slowly dry out
Shed. Not cabin
So you don't live there ???    Is  it  just a project ??
Amazing!!! and I love the all the little "flaws" they make your cabin youniqute and perfect. I wish I could build something so beautiful
a crow can be good company out there alone
You’re cool man. This is a great vid. Don’t worry about the haters.
Thanks for sharing God Bless All
Very nice build. But - 50? No thanks. I live in florida. I'm freezing at 70 degrees... I am working on getting a log home, just a little bigger, maybe in Tennessee
The peace and quite is absolutely Priceless!!!
Looks good to me!
Love your cabin.
Nice basement bedroom bro just need a hot chick !!😂
You’ll have to watch using them words “man-power” ... the liberals will find you and burn you at stake! 🤣😬
Dude your dad is so proud
So, where is the bathroom? Did i miss it in this video?
I really hope the Pastor of the Church you gifted the cabin to has enough appreciation to tarp and put steel roofing and ceiling joices on it! Would hate to see a heavy dump of snow rip the tarp because it won't slide.
Simple offers freedom 👍🏻!
Are uou going to fix up the inside & show us a beautiful tiny home
I was even expecting a lynx in the description below.
Super cool video dude I like it a lot
For 500 bucks you knocked it out of the park. Nicely done. Take care of your body and your back , don't kill yourself.✝️
wow
The world has suffered enough from religion. Couldn't stand another word after you said youth pastor.
I assume you have to buy the land right??
Pretty work
We have some beautiful wilderness up there. Great cabin!
Five to ten years?! Ours lasted two...
What? No global warming!
Your cabin rocks, well done Sir!
I want 1
Charles was my favorite.... He would call and I would call back
Awesome man
I thought he was going to show how he built it.  Disappointing.
"Simple offers freedom" is a grandiose way of saying "doing this simply allowed me more freedom". Not everything has to be romanticized.
Great Show,I have the want and 100% able in Knowledge and great health and strength,All From My Lord.
ugh ...youth pastor >.<
Some people have great talents! I wish I had talent like this 😭
How u use the bathroom out there
i maybe be a few years late but the people who point out every flaw are people who couldn't make it themselves and are just being twats *not all people who point out flaws but you get what i mean*
"simple offer's freedom". Those words are oh so true!😀
Lmao no permit required cause he had permission to build on private property? Well no fuckin shit
Nice ☺️☺️ I like so much
I just can't believe you're out im the wilderness without a shotgun or a rifle... well, I guess even the animals are friendly in Canada, eh?
Is this in NWO?
Lots of justification in this video..... no reason to justify anything
I find simple is the best way to live. I like technology don't get me wrong but there is something comforting about living simple and it's satisfying. Well to me it is anyways 🖒
well that one dude UFC'd a mountain lion im sure u can deal with a lynx 1v1 ya?
m
Hey The Outsider love your work man. So the land you built this on is private land and by that you mean its some random guys land or is it just random bush owned by the goverment? I wanna do something like this too.
2:53 factzzzzzz 💯!!! If only everyone thought 💭 like this!!!🤷🏼‍♀️🤗🤗🤗
This is awesome..I think it's an awesome project for a youth group..we need more good men and women in this world like you to do things like this with kids..they learned skills that could one day save their lives..God bless you
A "Youth Pastor " taking kids to a cabin deep in the woods sounds creepy AF!
Life sized Lincoln Logs
You r a good builder be proud of yourself ☝
That's is amazing
love your accent!    😬
yea what state can u do that
Awesome cabin well done
What area of Canada is this?
What a nice little cabin, it has a unique interesting design👍
Wood stove? no big deal. Let's in fresh air in the heating season wory not bout the door. my house is smaller. And a old wood pecker and his charming wife set on the front stoop, and wach the sun set. They like peanuts. Me a slice of Mellon. 73 om de kv4li
Haha that crow is like Sup, you got that rent bruh? Too cute!
Good job👍 as long as it works for you 👍 great work.
Cheers to you and charles.great video!!!🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
I know it wasn't in california
Very cool! 👌🏼👌🏼🌱🌳🌲🌿 PS: I like the crow...😂
That's awesome man, who cares what other people may complain about. As long as you're happy with it and it keeps you warm and out of the cold (which is the main thing), you made a cool cabin for $500, which is awesome in itself, than more power to you man.
Aww, reminds of a set of childhood toys. The Logs, does anyone remember these?   We were able build cabins and small log communities. Nice that you've brought this to life!  Job well done!
His manner of speaking reminds me of Marty Stouffer (Wild America).
i just clicked this to see it be built not for a monologue of your life and a crow and a church
Brilliant
What a waste of a great cabin
Going out at -20 C with bare head and not getting sick (presumably) - I wish I could do that.
Love Peace And Happiness!!👍👍👍👍✌🤩🤩🤩🤩
I absolutely love it!!
Good job now l need one 👋
Me and my son's saved a baby raven he would always visit every day usually, even after I was gone two years I came back to fix a neighbour's roof he came to visit. His name was Caw.
Wow,  Everyone is jealous  of you, It's  beautiful, Great Job. I think you are amazing  for building your cabin.  I thank you for sharing this Log Cabin it's  wonderful. Blessings from  my home to yours.  Kentucky USA.
The cabin is really pretty. I really admire his courage and workmanship but I am a city person and no way I would stay in the wilderness I got my fair share when I was young and decided that it was enough for a lifetime. I need neighbors (people) around however annoying they are
I am pretty upset about how many Youtubers have to deal with negative shit bags in the comments complaining about certain things.
Crows and Ravens are incredibly intelligent. It's likely that Charles did recognize you.
You built an amazing cabin , I like it . Looks great . Keep your strong attitude,  you will go far in life , most people are critical jeolous miserable souls , nevermind their opinions.  The world needs a heck of a lot more men like you . God bless you and God speed patriot!         🍃🌹
Good for u 🙏🙏🙂 same here btw love Jesus
Im jealous. Warm as hell but jealous. Awesome deal beother.
Good Job! Only one thing, you couldn't take supplies because of remoteness of the place, but you manage to bring 2 large couches!?
I thought he'd show how and where the squirrels were coming in.
This little cabin is so beautiful! I could live there, all year, for the rest of my life. I would especially love the winters! That place looks so beautiful in the snow!!
and my husband does not know how to change a light bulb! huh!
NO TO CODE? Big freaking deal. You paid for it. You are the only using it. If it fails or succeeds it's all on you. I personally think the negative comments break down into two camps: 1) People who are jealous they haven't built anything like this for themselves, and 2) People who have skill and hate seeing good work go to waste but not going all out to building it to the absolute best a project can be. This second group is well meaning but don't realize they are shitting on another man's joy he wanted to share with the world. We have dad's like that in the world. They want the best but kind of screw up the deliver and the kid feels dejected. It's your cabin. It's safe. It bring you joy. That's all that matters. Good work dude!
Major mistake, you have to take the bark off the logs otherwise they will rot. Then you have to seal them up with coating.
What kind of idiot donates a unsafe cabin to the youth
Where is this at? Im in Halifax n.s. grew up in cape Breton originally from Ontario, that's where this looks like
I think your cabin is awedome.  $500, you cant beat it.  Very impressed, thanks for sharing.
I love it 🥰
Ok me and my wife are going to build a log cabin i was wondering how many logs did it take to build it?
This is awesome
A friend of mine lived in an old cabin for a while that was built a long time ago by researchers of the area. You could see through the walls in some places but it worked just fine! Had electricity, plumbing, and even it's own sewage line! In a populated city area, permits are needed to ensure that your house won't fall onto your neighbor's house or be unsafe for occupants. (for example, saw a show where this guy started building an attachment onto his home with no permit and NO architect. Caused damage to his neighbor's house as they were attached and now the neighbor has huge cracks going through his walls) Out in the middle of nowhere or on a large piece of private property, however, you should be able to do what you want, especially if you plan on personally occupying it. People building their own houses or what not tend to put more care into it.
The Lord must've helped design your cabin plans : )
The only thing different I’d recommend is that I’d build it in my woods.  Great work.
That's just darn manly!
It's brilliant I love it 👌👌👌👌👌
i think your cabin is amazing! you should be proud. i would be!!!!!
North cabin in Canada where.  We are on manitoulin
Great job! My hubby and I want to build a cabin! You really done a great job on this!
Quick question, how do you find yourself in that big Forest
You can build an entire hose in parts of alaska without a permit
Not only did your excellent cabin stand up well, your crow neighbour remembers you.
If I could get Amazon to deliver me a Gallon of Milk, a loaf of bread, a bottle of whiskey and some cigarettes once a week I'd be set for life there.
The bear won't give a shit and will pass bye just like at my place.
My friend I say this. Any thing a man does and puts his heart and soul into it. I say is a real fine job indeed. The problem in the world of today is, people like to point an ugly finger and judge. But the fact is, they never can take a look at them selves at all. You have done a real fine job indeed. May Father God* keep blessing you, in Christ Jesus* name. AMEN
I will have a home like that. It's perfectly sized! 🌸 Namaste
Looks like an awesome little cabin I could live there
If you land is private, LAW, not Legal, but LAW says...You can build whatever the hell you like. Everyone has been tricked into thinking Private is ruled by Public Policy. If you just consent to it, sure they will Rule over You, thats what they wish for...Lemmings who wish for no rights.
I've watch many log cabin videos. this one has a honesty and simplicity that is really cool.well done
I think its perfect tbh
If the build suits your needs, then it it as perfect as needed. Kudos!
In this complicated world, simple offers freedom. Best phrase ever.
You're a nature person. I can't be five seconds in a temperature anything bellow 20F degree!!!
Anyone giving this hard working, smart, well balanced man a thumbs down is nothing but jealous. He is amazing, his skills are awesome, and crows like him, wink. But seriously, humans are so lazy anymore, I am glad to see someone actually making use of their life. GOOD job, cabin dude!
Awesome!
That Crow was Awesome 🐦
Great Job. I bet it was Nice to get away from City life for a Year. I would Love to build a Log Cabin and stay their a few Month's out of the Year.
U should Install Some Solar Panels, For some extra energy to power Other Things.
You said it’s been 4 or 5 seasons since you have been back to the cabin then you said you spotted links last in this area?
Not a criticism, but genuinely curious... Is it a problem that there is still bark on the logs? Will it shed in time or that particular species holds onto to its bark?
this SUCKS YOU DIDN'T SHOW HOW TO BUILD IT JUST B.S. PHOTO THAT  GO TO FAST
crows have a high intelligence, they are one of the few birds that will use tools to get at food!
Badass! Very cool spot to hangout. Great job. I'm definitely not blessed in building things but I sure do try. I hope to get pretty decent.
u couldn't of shown the interior could you
Charles if you didn't know was the building inspector ; )  Seeing how it was 10 by 10 he couldn't say anything. But liked what he saw and kept coming back.
so you say you saw a lynx last year...but haven't been there for 4 seasons........ confused.
Good job man!  I think that all kids should have the opportunity to lend a hand in a construction project such as this.  It's a great way to fill in the blanks on how to complete maybe less than certain parts, like the roof for instance.  I wish I had paid more attention myself as a kid when my dad built our cabin.
Great work mate. Sensational video. Subscribed.
That's pretty cool you did all of that by yourself. I wonder what you could build for $5000.
“complicated offers bells and whistles...simple offers freedom” well said my friend...💯💯💯💯
I live in northern Canada ,build ANYTHING on crown land,they will burn that sucker DOWN!!!!!!!!
I love it...the cantalevered loft is genius...we have a 10x10 on our property with bunks counter table and bathroom...we have running water when we run get it lol👍...camper toilet to homemade septic ,just add water
Great story , awesome build
Can you please make  update of this cabin thanks
Its sad the government can tell you how to build your house
All that work, and no footings? Your bottom logs will begin rotting when the ground thaws. Why didn't you use logs for your roof and loft to stay authentic? Not impressed.
Please help me find,a way to have a home like this
This is a good home for anyone I would be proud to have it Love it!!!!
$500.00 my ass!
I just seen this. Tugs at my heart. I hope you are doing well my friend.
This video is truely beautiful. A time capsule for your friends and family to enjoy long after you and the cabin have moved on. The structure may not last a century, but the memories will last forever. Hopefully you insipre many to do something like this.
There is no way that cost only $500 to build. This video is misleading. That said, it looks good but it ain't $500 to build. It's atleast $1000 not including the wood stove.
Soo how do you get supplies way out there? And what are your plans for it?  Great job anyway ... love it. Amazing! Wish I could do that.
if you try to do this in Italy you can't for the state. It is amazing but you cannot apply in some nations like Italy for example
This is amazing! Man I love it. Great job and much respect!
Love it! Living amongst Nature!
Thanks for making me believe there is still good people in this world.
I so wanna build an adobe house now
It can be a hostel. You can earn rent for that little house. People want to pay you for that experience
Beautiful area!!!!!!!!  Amazing job man.  Wonderful.
Maybe in a hundred years someone will stumble upon your cabin and wonder who built it and why, just like that cabin you found in your other video.
Nice story!  I wondered how you could just leave it but now that I know it's church property, well  it's nice to know it gets use and won't just fall into disrepair.  It's such a cozy looking place to spend weekends or vacation time!  Good job!
It's gorgeous. Keep doing YOU! 💙
Wow love that cabin.....
It is really funny; I had a pet bird and called him Charley.  Charley seems to be a very popular name for pets.
My thumb up for Charles and your feeling of the outside.
I'm jealous.
Nice work!
Very Nice ,' God Bless You Brother .
How much would it cost me for you to help me build one ? Love a tiny home we have 2 acres of land that we bought it's not a half a mile to the river. I'm reenlisting to the military soon but would like to have a home since I'm going reserve if anyone reads this thanks for you help and search
Beautiful video , I like that its not rushed
I'd smoke weed in there
Awesome job
Make sure you record the property through the church as private property, so the county does not start up on you. It should be clear it is a 501c
Wow , What a great build. Its great to see that little Gems like this  survive outside the British  Empire.  For all of their hundreds of millions of dollars spent on computer systems to control and track humanity in the name of making us safe (yeah right) ,  little things like this that are significant slip right by.
As an outsider, can i do the same? Bild  a cabin of tha size without permit?
Youth pastor 😁👍👍 AMAZING!
‘Invention’ is like everything new, ‘Innovation’ comes around and works out any shortcomings from its genesis, however this is also the start of a habit that slowly makes the original idea into a perpetual profiteering scheme that leads to mans inability to tell whether or not ‘innovation’ is still necessary. Some say stopping would be wise, others say continue until someone catches on, those wanting an end will be few because nothing is to gain by doing so, those who continue profit enough so the good hearted few who restrained their lust by ethical decency cannot possibly counter the injustice of an overbuilt industry of the initial conception. Perfection cannot exist in or of mans creation, he plunders and ruins everything he touches, and by the time he has realized his greed will destroy his children, his children’s children, and his children’s children’s children, even they are too busy to listen to his wisdom, too busy making the same mistakes he has made.  This is an example of everything; the Government inclusive. Tell NO ONE.
Thanks for taking th time to post it. I think it is awesome
great job nice little getaway
Those are some impressive old world skills there. I’m glad that you were able to teach them to helpful neighbors and the youth. Build on friend.
Great cabin ... love the area ...
Omg I need a house like this unfortunately it's illigal here. But so cool
Respect!!!
$500. Amazing
Only thing I'd add would be a corrugated metal roof. That snow will eventually make its way on your head if you don't reinforce the roof. Even with the tarp cover, the sun or a bear will tear it up.
Honestly, I think Charlie the Crow comes around because he's trying to collect your rent.  This is Crow territory, son.
I wish I was in your youth group
I like the music 😊
Good job on the cabin
Please put a couple Logs as columns on the front so it doesn't look like that top will fall off! So top heavy, it looks like it just fall forward...Love it though...l really do!
It's a beauty
What a lovely little cabin!! Wonderful job mate, it looks so cozy!
I don’t know a lot about cabins but this one looks awesome.  What a great place to get away from society.
It's perfect
Talks like the dude off dances with wolves
great stuff ! thanks for sharing !
Really enjoyed your video answer Congratulations on Creating An Awsome Cabin 😎...subbed 😉
LOOKS AWESOME! Great work! --Robert (Portland, OR)
Why don't you try filling in the gaps in your door with rope? It would do the job and I think it would look good with the wood. Any way, cool little cabin. Congrats.
Read “no permit required”, had to see if this was true.
Awesome dude your the man
I love it
Awesome design man!, i hope to build something like that some day!
What part of Canada is this
ik blijf het 1 mooi Huisje vinden zo verscholen in het bos
Simple and beautiful!
Wow that is awesome 😍😍😍😍😍
What's the music after your narration?
What is the difference in temperature outside and inside cabin?
What's the permit situation on a treehouse . Permits are a con job . Great job on the cabin . I'm sure the children from your church will take good care of it . God bless .
He built a log house without peeling the skin. The wooden thickness is a little too thin, and the ladder that goes up the second floor seems uncomfortable. Anyway, I envy your passion.  I wish you happiness.
Only one thing wrong,mist not mine!
This looks fucking awesome
Can't tax self-sufficiency I tell you what. When I save up enough money and learn the lay of the land, I will build my own cabin with minimal modernism. Its our inner nomadic ancestral past that speaks to us to venture and live off the land. Great video. Very motivating.
Awesome
1:40 Some day, I want to have a view like that myself. One day I'll get off my ass and into the wilds..
OwO what a sexual house
How do u take showers?
Nice Cabin.👍😎👍
I love it!  It looks like a post card.
Teach us
If I had a way I would move I to that little cabin and live forever.i dont need much to survive.
Mr outsider I love it
I'm jelly of the land
Bro, I’m impressed. Not sure everyone understands what it takes to pack in what you’ve already packed in, yet alone build what you have. Great job, really nice.
Aha. Free land.  It's amazing to me how everyone else in the world seems to have ready access to free land upon which to build or do other zany things. I guess I just don't know the right people or something.
I want one to LIVE in!
i will do much better than that and use varnish on the wood so it never rots ;) im gonna make cat so so happy forever fully cured and safe and happy far from frequencies and baby boomer mkultra bs shes no idea what ive been up to havnt spoken to her in 5 months im planning her future then ill let her decide if im worthy or not to be her man x
" simple offers freedom"⭐️✔️✌🏾️
Beautiful, Cosy little Home from Home! Brilliant, Love It.
So when you line the logs on top of each other to build the walls what stops them falling over is the stakes behind it?
I'd definitely put in a stronger door so you don't get bear shit everywhere.
so beautiful, i admire ur work of art. thanks for sharing <3
You're a cool guy with admirable motives. It's a beautiful thing!
7:26  I recognize that notification sound
Great job. ild reall be interested in what the instrumental mucic is called at the end if the video.
it looks soo freaking great!!!! i love it!!!!
Great job man I wish I have something like this👍
Lol @ 'permits'
What’s the name of the exit song???
"Complicated gets you bells and whistles, but simple, simple gets you freedom"
I love it. A dream for me. To have a place all your own and get away from everything. How can find hate in this?? This IS the American dream
Fun Crow Fact: Crows observe everything and have the ability to memorize and recognize people's individual faces. Studies have proven that they can remember a face for the minimum of two years, so yes, Charles did recognize you.
back int the day houses were built by communities for free, everyone pitched in to build everyone a house. the boys would help to so they could learn the tricks. i wish this was still a thing
It's incredible that we have so many homeless people knowing that we have these kind of resources. it's so unfortunate that Society cannot Unite and build little towns like this to help the thousands of homeless in this country all it takes is four walls and a roof to keep someone out of the cold
Great Cabin, exactly what Im looking to build!
Love your little cabij. I truly hope to get a small piece of land and live off the grid in ky very own littlebabin. We're  eben lookingbat poniesband a small wagon fornsjort trips to the storenif needed. Get bscvk to the simple waynof life.
Great video and such an incredible way to make memories with your teens. They must have been very happy to have you as their pastor.
Why do you put your camera down, walk off, then go back just to pick it up?
I met some crazy woman that built a cabin like this in the trails somewhere, She and her husband were hunters but a bear killed him. there is absolutely no difference in indoor and outdoor temperature in those things. you need a furnace and alot of chopped wood to keep it burning 24/7. you can use plastic and insulation to stop the walls and roof from leaking
Beautiful!
Would not a plastic vapor barrier have kept in heat and wind out?
🏚🏠🌨🌪🎄🔥☃🌲🌴🌳🌵☕🍳☕😙😚👌👍👏👏💕💕💕
....yahhh....late April because Global Warming is a figment of the liberal's imagination and always has been....
I hate the government, we are not free. You have to pay for water, fishing hunting license, permits. Not long ago the earth was free!
I’m surprised that the door wasn’t built tighter to keep out the cold, hopefully that is the only place it’s creeping in from!
Cabin in 10x10 , on privately owned land,  that is why permit is not required
How would you double the size with an extra 500?
People like this is what makes the world great good job man looks nice 👍🏻
Not being critical, but you did such an AWESOME job on the cabin , why didn't you make the door a little more weather proof (critter proof) ?  You can bet that your couch is winter hang-out for all the local  mice population.
I love how you built it it’s beautiful!!!! Wish I could do the same simple is best
Nice video.  I agree on the tarp thing it's cheaper and more practical for a roof.   I developed a leak in my roof this winter.  Didn't want to fix it till next spring, so I put a heavy duty tarp from the ridgeline down the edge and it stopped all leaks.  As long as the tarp is taut and doesn't flap in the wind - it's as good as any roofing material.
How do you make these kinds of cabins bear and 'visitor' proof? It seems like if there is food there, there's no way creatures with such amazing senses of smell won't be tempted.   Also side note, curious how do log cabins do in earthquakes?
Dude talking bout how cold it is and hes just walkin around with jeans and light jacket lol
They are jealous man! Cuz it takes nerve and talent plus a little hillbilly ingenuity to do what you have done. Nice build, good times.
so you indoctrinate young children into gullible stupidity
Great job!  Now I'm going to get back to playing "The Long Dark"!
I would really love to do something like this.   Thanks for very much for sharing.     Where I grew up. I made dens and tree houses in the woods behind my parents house.  Then the bulldozers moved in and they built a housing estate.   Just as I was getting big enough to make something on this scale.    I'm in my 40's now. But I would still love to get hold of some woodland and build something similar to your Cabin.    It's obviously taken a massive amount of effort and great vision to build a cabin in such a remote location.   Very inspirational. 🙏
Charles was probably looking for some food. . id so trade my life right now to live in something like this.  Id like to build one one day.
At 3:10  you could probably hear a plane circling overhead. That was me looking to deliver that large pepperoni.  Sorry. You really need to mark your house better.   Jus' Sayin'.
Bush lol
Very cool
Global warming! If it wasn't for us humans you could be trekking through waist deep snow in August.
https://bit.ly/2TKmzK3?-gaaardennnstorageshedsss 6599
if you decide to save it just dig under it and  raise it with  hydraulic jacks. they dont have a lot of travel but they go far enough to  block it up in small steps.  get it up. rock it up or mix up some footings onsite. that way the sills wont rot
the broken axe was a stroke of genius. very cool.
So the links has one dog hand and one human hand?  I've never been to Canada.
I think this is amazing!
This is very cool I love it
Cool brother God bless you and your disciples.  All in Jesus name
Bruh I feel this cold shit, the north be harsh man. I could be near May at a track meet n it’ll snow
The crow part was my favorite.  im a beatboxer who specializes in animal sounds.  I wrote a book called "Two Sounds at Once"  in which this technique of beatboxing to communicate with crows.   "Bioboxics"  "bio"  is the prefix "boxics" is beatboxing aspects of making animal sounds.  My YouTube channel is "Two Sounds at Once" and I have animal sound tutorials you can share with your youth group or try if you want. Cool video.  Thank you for demonstrating the beauty of simplicity.  God bless you!
If you do something that satisfys you, thats all that matters, looks great.
This is amazing
Charles.     Charles expected life span is no different than yours, 70 or 80 years.  Charles, according to research, does indeed recognize you after a year or even two or three.   Of even more import,, if Charles,, or Charlie,, raise a brood of chicks, they can teach the chicks what you look like.  U of W researchers have shown that parents can teach chicks to recognize and avoid the 'bad' man.  Feed Charles whenever you can,, a bit of bread or meat depending upon what Charles likes.  A similar partnership in central Montana had a crow warning me of rattlesnakes.  The crow would spot one,, give a specific warning call, and I would know where to be cautious or avoid.  I gladly included that bird in my morning and even meals.   Smarter than many of my friends.
That's awesome
Love the design !
wonderful small house. Must be great to build something like that by your own. btw: crows/ ravens recognize peoples faces very well. Even if you wear a hat, or would cover your face they would know you as a well known person by the way you walk.
Land cost? Plumbing?appliances? Windows?
Why not clear caulk in door gaps, or even paintable caulk painted brown?
In Alaska a raven flying over head is bad luck
is there a height limit? Can you build it to be 100 ft tall or something?
It's a bit strange to me that the walls, when made like this, serve as sufficient insulation.
Main man Charles.
Very cool
Awesome build, pay no mind to the negative comments for they are born of a jealous heart. Rock on bro.
Wow...beautiful!
This video was well done and edited brillently. To allow young ones to learn building skills is an amazing gift you gave them. I only wish I could have been apart and helped with this project. Sorry if this is rather forward and your married, however you are an extremely good looking man. It's just a compliment and have a blessed upcoming year. PeAcE 😇
Nice ! A project not done in vain.
Man i love your cabin!! Don’t care what anyone says there jealous they cant do it themself !
You shouldn't have explained yourself, you already lost to the hater's pressure. This is some great stuff that you did alone and is definetely a successful moment in your life! Good on you !
I like the CCM bag! 0:54
If you added the pertinent facts to your title, "Canadian bush"...  views would be way down. (The description is void of this critical information, too)  Ergo, "Clickbait".
Where do you poop?
But not in Michigan
What fun!
If I may ask, how easy is it to *find* this cabin, especially in the winter?  Did you mark the trail or entrance in some way?
THIS GUYS BANGING KIDS IN THAT CABIN FOR SURE
So cool
Northern Ontario?
Stop lifting with your back man
Love the simplistic . Be proud of what you have achieved.... We need more people in this world like you... Bless you.. Love from Ireland...
"The bottom rows dont show any sign of rot" *proceeds to show 6 corner logs with pre rot* should last 25 years!
I hope Charles is still around feed him and he will bring shiny gifts. Crows do this
Amazing great job man. I’d love to do something like this one day
I would live there. That scenery is beautiful and the cabin is humble.
It's hard to do this here in the States.  You need some real estate regardless.
So in other words it has to be out in the middle of nowhere where, where one will likely struggle through harsh weather and bareness to survive, to avoid permit laws. And of course you don't live there, which means this is just an aesthetic hobby, and it wasn't even feasible to try. Pointless...
outdoorsman with jeans? what!?
He's cute too
Awesome" I love it" can you build me one? I would definitely be interested" super nice you have some skills I love it
The cabin looks great but the back ground is beautiful
How many logsdid your cabin take?
Great log cabin. This is my dream home in England but just one month to go before contruction starts. Is there any tips you could give like hjow you insulated it etc.
bodes well on you to have a crow friend.
so for the cost of making 2 iphones, you built a cabin. nice, thats some ACTUAL value there!
Charles is hilarious!  What a good friend 😄😍
If you wanted to put footings in you could always dig them and and pour them and use a jack to lift up the cabin in order to shim it...but like you said for the next 25 years its good
2:02 His eyes were bigger than his stomach? Lol.
Woah im 3 years late oops
U.S GOVERNMENT WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
I could make a better cabin, a minecraft dirt cabin.
Cool
You said, "Simple offers Freedom", right on! Well done & keep up the good work.
Crows are extremely smart they can remember faces for up to 5 years!!!
This is so tranquil and I absolutely love it
This is inspiring and a all round a win win project. So how come 1.8K thumbs down?
참 멋지다~~
Hey! Charles definitely recognized you! Crows are extremely intelligent and one of the most well known examples of their intelligence is building relationships with specific humans and returning to the homes of humans they like.
i love this cabin!   thanks for giving me ideas!!
I’m planning to build something a bit bigger and on foundation. I’m probably going to solar power it . Totally off grid and it won’t ever go on grid either.
Sooo your saying I can just move to Canada, build a log cabin mansion and just live off what I grow and hunt and not deal with all the bullshit that comes with "society" ?
Lowe’s or Home Depot have will call lumber and sometimes scratch and dent metal roofing ! Love the cabin not a fan of the tarp roof but like you said it’s cheap !
The only thing that caught my attention is that the rafters aren't done correctly so they aren't supporting weight safely. Might not be a problem with such a small place but with enough wet snow your roof runs the risk of collapse. Easy to do next time - just notched them so the ends are actually supported on the long over head log. Adds just a couple minutes per 2 x 6 with no extra cost and strength goes up a ton
Wish I lived where it snows and build me a nice cozy log cabin and live out my days living off the land. With just me an the wife. Unfortunately the wife does not like the cold and that kind of life style.☹️☹️☹️.....great build man btw
Great job inspiring video fantastic work and keep it up buddy forget the comments that are negative because you did a great job and if you ever feel that the bottom remember the world is upside down
Crows are some of the smartest birds alive. They remember and recognize faces. There is  video on YouTube of a crow dropping stones into a bottle to raise the water to drink from it. So I guarantee he remembers you.
We should be protecting trees not cutting them down, smh
You narrate this video like Kevin Kostner in Dances with Wolves. Especially your expalining your relationship with the crow. Nicely done.
Very Cool cabin....
You could make another same house just beside this one ..and make a hall between them ...which could become a extra spacious big house ....
Who doesn't love a log cabin I think they are some of the best homes to live in !
Heaven on earth 👌
How can people hate this?
Will Lynx attack people? Much smaller than a mnt lion/puma.
Great job 👍 perfect lil cabin for one or two people
The voice over is made by Mortgage Freeman
It looks like those cabins in the winter biome, Fortnite Season 7
We had crows that would land on the beach every day.  Loved it.  They can recognize and remember humans for years. The cat was probably just using your foot prints to walk in, and not stalking you.  Cats are pretty smart. Shame you had to move.
If I got lost in the woods, I'd "break into" your home  until I was able to use debris to make an SOS on the ground. :D
Why is it that 90% of these big bushcraft youtubers are Canadian? I guess they have a lot more undeveloped wilderness than a lot of the US, but still. Kinda crazy.
God bless! I'm a youth worship leader.
awesome job, and a little clear caulk would fix the door gaps and keep the cool look. love it hope to see more. keep up the good work.
Très très belle maisonnette ,très courageu de ta part de l'avoir construite. merci d'avoir partagé ton expérience MAIS , il y a trop de trous à la porte et à la fenêtre , donc l'isolation n'est pas encore fini en 2014 ;et en 2018?
Simple offers freedom! Love that
Nicely filmed, great story and narration   At first I was thinking this really needed a bed of music, but as I got a few minutes into it, I realized the silence and pauses were just perfect.  Thanks for sharing your experience.   ...a city dweller.
I dig it. Hate snow but your cabin looks very cozy
I'm so amazed by the simple ingenuity👍🏾.
SENTENCE CORRECTION FOR BELOW, YEP, THAT'S MY BOY
YOU ARE THE SON THAT EVERY DAD ON THIS EARTH WOULD BE SO PROUD TO SAY TO EVERYONE HE MET, YEP, THAT'S BOY, GOD BLESS YOU. MICK FROM UK
So awesome
Great 👍🏻 job... God Speed
nice little shed, not cabin, woodwork has terriple, maybe him first time made anythink at wood, ewery wall and door can see out ,uh. have you newer hear plank joint need add little plank on top not see ewery joint out. haha. but good make and learn how made next time better, and cheap, good have own land, i no has can buy all my life land because cost 100 000 € little land my country. i dream all my 55 year life buy land but no can, if have land can build tiny house and live cheap, no need pay rent.
https://bit.ly/2TKmzK3?-shed-plansss-8x12
wtf?!..... APRIL AINT SPRING, ITS AUTUMN!!!....wait i forgot i live in the southern hemisphere.... haha.....
it's a nice cabin but just a little too small for me. I wish I could have something like this to get away from people.  I like the loft and the ladder out of the way against the wall.   How is it insulated between the logs? Just curious as I don't know much about construction.
Has Al Gore told you we have global warming?  Why aren't you warm?
,
Anyone too picky on how you did the cabin probably shouldn't of clicked on the video. Nice job man.
No permission? Wait for the lawsuit.
I want to go there right now...
Amazing cabin! praise God!
What do you do for protection against wild animals like bears and lynx
You lost me at “youth pastor.” Stop brainwashing children.
A guy I knew was looking into permits, in Alberta at least, and he said they're not needed on private land for private buildings, only for buildings that are open to the public (so I guess a church with a youth group might need a permit.) I hate a bare face and uncovered head in -20, I always wear a balaclava and a toque; you've got some warm blood. The end music sounds really good at 2x (I find it's rare that music sounds good at 2x, it has to be really smooth to not sound jolty when sped up.)
yup I built a cabin outta toilet paper  I had to carry the rolls there myself.. uphill both ways!! in a snowstorm!! with no shoes..!! Seriously though, what fun.. Complicated is for the city.. simple is for the country.. Built to code? (city people).. Very nice place.. I like the loft idea. stay up high because warm air rises.. wish I had thought of that in my youth when I was spending most of my free time in the woods.. it's to bad you had to leave.. But in life we always have to move on... eventually.. it is the end of 2018 But thanks for that share...!
I think it's pretty freaking cool and haters are always going to hate there's always somebody who needs to let you know they're the smartest one in the room and they know more than you. But who cares you do you.
looks great and  perfect must be beautiful out there
Yeah F the haters your cabin rocks!! Nice job bud!!!!
I've been a carpenter for 29 years and Buddy....you done a Great JOB.Thats something you can hang your Hat on.
Looks like a perfect place for a hermit to pray to God all day and all night !... I wish i can also do that... more then anything...
Did you live in this cabin?
This is so awesome I hope I can do something like this someday
..................................*
I have decided, I think I love this guy.
Nice ! Good offering to the church of God
More haters on here than on a political channel! I am guessing there are a lot of people who viewed this who fancy themselves New England craftsmen. Yet fail utterly when it comes to critical self analysis and realizing that they might be great carpenters yet they lack courage to do something like this. Babylonian slaves.
You should have narrated the movie Dances with Wolves. Excellent video.
Wow what happened to global warming?  By the way, God Bless you!
The door opens to the wrong side, so we'll need you to make a new cabin. Ok tyvm ttyl
Can somebody do this in California mountains?
Charles remembers you like it was yesterday. They memorize significant faces.
I wish I had a spot to build a cabin on
the doors too thin/why not a real door?  u say nothing inside cabin if a bear gets in?  everything will be torn to shreds...protect what u built...don't be soo naive. not finding fault just making what u got better...
I love the way you said that "simple, simple offers freedom"
lynx, thems good eatin :)
Beautiful
Ok so it's not Trump Towers but you've built that little place with you're own two hands from nothing  using a lot of basic tools and with no elaborate workshop ,so you have earned the right to be justly proud of it . There  are very few people who wouldn't love a little place like that ,myself included .
Great one horse cabin. Bet the stove was fun! Sledding it in... Nice job, and a memory for a lifetime!
a few Scotsmen needed to help you lift those logs , love your videos

Nice video
Beautiful! I love it 😍
DO not say no permit required or they will try everything they can to make you get a permit on it than tax you for it. carefull there.
Should have insulated your roof line
Ravens are cool birds.
Cool!
This is is tight
Excellent thoughts and just a thought on the bottom. It's small enough to be lifted easily. I think it's creativily designed
Why did you leave the place??????????
*1.9K people like mortgages! ;-)*
Neat!
loving watching all your videos here in Cardiff, South Wales
Maybe the pine nuts were intended to cover the rent.
Fail. Direct costs of $500. Stolen trees and 2000 hours of work
You're lucky you ain't in Ohio. The zombies would have turned that into an abandominium.
Awsome build
I like it....!!
Fuck government permits and taxes
Very good cabin and very cost friendly. You have done an amazing job, indeed.
Awsome man its perfect, just idea the door you can use flex seal should cover the cracks . Doors awsome def keep it
Awesome!!!!! The finished log cabin looks great....
Great job be safe !!
چه طبیعتی !خدای من
Badass party shack
Sounds like the pets are having it rough, not the lynx.
That is beautiful great job
He built a real life 1 x 1
Great job! Its perfect!
Bugs will eat holes in your logs... at least here they did to my log cabin in the South with no bark left on them, cut on on a sawmill, as bugs were already in the trees.   I'd stain them with creosote or diesal/turpentine and motor oil or something.   I would not put any wood on the ground, it's an immediate vector for termites.   Here they will get into your wood no matter where you set it within months, as soon as it rains .  You can't leave any wood on the ground.  Always put your wood up off the ground with stone between it and the ground, and maybe a piece of tin between the wood and the stone (to prevent moisture).  The higher you build off the ground, the better, at least a foot and a half to 2 feet, so you can crawl under it, slide things under it, and for the main reason... in case of flooding and puddles... even if your not in a valley or gully, you hit a week or month when it just won't quit raining... you don't want your cabin floor on the same level as the ground.  Also, over time, the ground will rise as it accumulates vegetation rubbish and debris, and stuff blows up against the walls and gets stuck there.  So yeah, I think you kind of screwed up big time building on the ground, and I would learn from it and not do it again.   Make four pillars of stone on the corner, and have your floor up in the air.   The air circulation will prevent rot and termites and help against ants.  If it were me, I'd jack it up with two of those heavy duty lift car jacks that auto shops use, and place concrete blocks under all the corners.  For covering the door on the inside, use a blanket, then a blue tarp like a sandwich.  Whichever order works best.  I covered my door for years like that and still do.
I'm all up in my warm covers and I think I'm in that cold as cabin so relaxing
Very beautiful cabin very well done great job
WHAT!!!    Minus  40deg's    seriously?
Did you drop your keys at the end of the intro?
Дверь вся светится фронтон тоже, потолка нет, сруб из неокоренной древесины рублен в обратную чашу без пазов, да че же у них там за климат такой что позволяет выжить при таком распиздяйстве?
Was the land yours?
"i'm a youth pastor and i was taking kids deep into the woods to "build a cabin" " and this video went from cool to creepy and concerning in one sentence flat
awesome cabin. I would live in it for sure.
Can you build an out house ? Without permits or anything legal , I mean  ?
Cool cabin done for dirt cheap! Congrats!
Really nice of you to share this video with us, if you’re ever in Massachusetts or near by and u decide to build another one contact me I’m looking for any excuse to leave the city. The log cabin looks great 👍🏼 man. Gd job
Be proud you have that talent, & if the cabin was located in Canada I would gladly help you out daily, just for the chance to experience natural peace. You do have a paradise. Never allow government to bully or prevent you from pursuing goals. In Saskatchewan we all experience a bully attitude, that has resulted in massive tax increases for cottage owners & simple people living off grid. Just recently property taxes in rural areas increased 150%, many will find it impossible to pay thousands in yearly property taxes. Very nice video that does offer hope, beautiful cozy cabin., best always, Kip
Fuck authority, do as you please on your property.
Nice job
WOW, you and your Dad sure are a hardy bunch for the 2000s.  I'm from Northern Ontario very near Iroquois Falls. I grew up there in the 50s & 60s. I've had to do a lot of what I've seen you doing in your videos except building a log cabin/house itself. We built a regular house in 1960 up there and just off a gravel road 3 miles from a small town called Porquis Jct, not way the hell out in the BUSH a million miles from everyone. Sheesh... I thought I had it bad back then but I had no choice, you choose to do this. lol  If I may ask though, what part of Northern Canada are you doing this, just a more general idea than Northern Canada if you don't mind? Northern Canada covers lot of territory so I was just wondering if you were anywhere near my old stomping grounds. Anyway watching you and your Dad for that last day or two brought back a whole lot of childhood memories and reminded me why I left Northern Ontario as soon as I was old enough to recognize and find "civilization". (i.e. running water that comes from a tap and a flush toilet). lol, I never was near as hardy as you guys are. BTW... WELL DONE. Despite my shivering memories, I really enjoyed watching you work and freeze your asses off. I Look forward to more vids on the log cabin build. Cheers ;)
Nice job McCandless!!!
Nice cabin......good job. God bless !
Would love to do this, but am having trouble aquiring land....any advice??
What's the name of the music playing in the video?
I still love this little cabin!. One day I'll have one. LOL  Glad to see its still standing and in great condition!.
Oh and to add to my previous comment.  If your worried about rot you can always lift cabin and add said footings.
I think your cabin has character!  Don't change a thing. I too am a builder and I take pleasure in my creations!
How in the world did you get couches out there? And how did you get them inside? Did you build the house around the couches? Lol
Return when is snowing? Lol really.  I would have waited till summer.
This is habitable yes. This is more than I could do yes. But.... Seriously the huge gaps in the front door? Indicator that this was youtube project and nothing more. Not one night was spent in it ever.
What happened to the upper part of your jeans? Acid wash?
you are brilliant sir! this is awesome and inspiring... would love to do this
This is BEAUTIFUL! Great job!! Nice, little place, PERFECT REALLY! I especially LOVE the landscape in the snow!!!
Thanks for showing us  your beautiful home!! May our CREATOR bless you for labor of love.
"...simple offers freedom." Well said my friend. One of the great truths of life. So sad many come to it late.
Congratulations! God bless you abundantly. I think you build more than a cabin, you  build a dream and this is priceless.
👍👍👍you rock outsider👍👍👍
I can show u how to generate all the electricity u want very cheap no solar no wind very simple email me tommybrenes@hotmail.com
why did you wait a year to go back hell i would be up there way more often
You explain yourself too much just be you no need for so many excuses
I like this video and this guy. Good job and thank you for being you.
Dick Proenneke...
i simply like the instrumental music at the tail end. can someone tell me the composer please
Awesome. But i am amazed that 'the government" would care if you have a permit or not way out there in the Canadian bush. I can understand the concern for making sure people don't cause forest fires, or cause pollution in the pristine wilderness out there, but whether or not you build your shelter according to their building codes? and i Agree , "simple is good" ! Nice job. try nailing some door stops applied to your door jamb to block air openings. also you could tack weather stripping to inside of door stops to really tighten it up. and a nice 'katie-bar' or two would help deter a bear, and maybe shutters inside windows if you are really concerned about bears. Good luck and God bless, hope you guys have lots of fun out there.
I think you did a great job.
ya know whats bullshit.  needing permits to build things on property that you own. as if the government didnt hold enough power over us as it is. its like a soviet union, next we cant travel.
ITS AN EXPENSIVE HAY TARP
Love it ...Well spent 500$s
At time stamp 9:31 on lower left you have a tree with a beaver working on it, might want to keep an eye on him I would hate for him to start on your cabin also,lol
Wow awesome, you have a great cabin!!!💞☀
Reminds me of the area where I live , North Pole ,Alaska .Skinny Spruce, Paper Birch...
Wow you can't say things like that !!!! That it is cold and snowing in April??? What's wrong with you??? It doesn't fit in the Global warming thing !!!! You have to say that it's hot  and everything is dead !!!! Cool it man !!!!       Ha ha ha
I think it's great in those people that say those mean and ugly things are just people that are jealous and haven't never Bill anything or done anything in their life worthwhile anyways and just watch videos all day commenting on people's achievements that they disapprove of so don't listen to me great hang out and if I was out there I'd come hang out with you and good job
Why is a permit required just because it's bigger than 10 x 10 feet?  It's your own land? The government would never even know that cabin was there.
You enjoy your freedom and space my friend. And wipe your arse on the "feel good - let me tell you how to live your life - while I sponge on others lot." More "humans" should have the balls to do this. And tell the REAL parasites on this planet to go and get stuffed. You have my respect.
I know this video is old, but just in case, I was wondering how in the hell did you get couches up there lol wow!  Awesome cabin though to do this by yourself is nothing short of incredible!!👍🏻
It is a beautiful little hut in a really  spectecular spot. To have that for just 500$ ...  Great work, man. YOU ROCK! Edit: "Charles" ... is really cool XD
Who cares man it's fucking bitch and I would love to have one myself you're a lucky man who cares what's wrong with it it's fucking nice everyone u built is nice
I see someone plays minecraft
hate miles fuck u , really nice video and greetings from the desert Saudi arabia
Even it is now 2018: God providing beauty outdoors, and to think He desires to "share". Even giving you, and the group -  "Charlie"🙋 James 1:17
What's up with the Hobbit sized bedrooms??? Everybody does not like to be cramped up in them tiny bedrooms. I see it is better to make your own because many people are charging 37,000 to buy their bs!!!
I just thought I'd view this small miracle tonight. I live in spokane wa and thinking about a little piece of land, could you suggest on the spokane side? Thanks, yours bradley
It's so relaxing to watch..
Charles! 😂 <3
Orr
Hats? Burrrrr! Kaw kaw nice music 2 stepping tunes LOL  doe c doe so fun to watch you busy boys in the woods.
Thankyou guys for showing US how beautiful it can be working together side by side! Nicely done gentlemen!
Cute as a bugs ear your cabin give Charles a kawkaw kaw  from Kansas
So cool.
Why did u move away
What state do you live in and what location? It sounds weird asking this but I love places cold and snowy
My goal is to be someone like you someday!
Wish I could do something like that where I live. My local government would expect to spend $10,000 or more on permits and even then they can still say no. Even if you dot all your eyes and follow the regulations to a T.
Wearing designer jeans snow shoeing. Interesting
That log kicked your ass 😂. Props though, I know the shitty feeling of working in cold weather when something as simple as drinking water is almost impossible
nice cabin awsome work if i was you i would never sell it
My hubby could make this in a heartbeat!  We’re from Canada too of course! 👌👌👌 Great job my friend!! 👏👏👏
That 10×10 is all I'll show to the inspector but under the ground you could build quite a spread. I think that would be a good idea for people who like to get around all that gov b.s.
"lots of snooo."
Nice man. You can always Denmark inside to out or vice versa. You really inspire me I'll have to send you a update on mine.
This video make me wanna live in Canada and build cabin. Love from Indonesia :)
Top-notch, man... some really nice touches.. and a good video to boot. Puts me in mind of a shed/cabin I built- I should say finished off in the Michigan hardwoods.. My Dad started it in the late 1960's for use as a tool shed. After he passed in 1976, I came onto the property and with a lotta help from a carpenter friend we finished it off with a new roof, window and 2 glass doors, and an elevated floor.. I insulated it and built a full-size bed frame in one corner and installed a wood stove in another.. Ran a drop-cord powerline from the main house where other family members lived.. had lights, radio, stereo and color TV! Since I was then working at a lumber place I had access to a LOT of scrap wood to burn, mostly pine ends and bits from 2X4, 2X8 and such. Very comfortable and I entertained a few girl friends too..
.....WTF!!!? Who the hell (in Gov't), arbitrarily decided that no "cabin" cold exceed 100 sq. feet in area?!!! I'd say F#CK THEM!!!!....
FYI: I find it odd, (and foolish), to be anywhere in the remote winter woods, while wearing cotton clothing!... IMHO: Once the initial structure is completed, One could easily keep building additional "add- on" structures, separately standing, nearby, connected only by short walkways, with shaded/semi protected walls, thus allowing many "separate rooms" for any number of needed uses (bedrooms, bathrooms/showers/saunas, kitchens, pantry, work shop areas, material storage rooms, etc Great video, anyway!!!
This video is so relaxing, lol. This house is awesome! And can I say, this Crow bit made me tear up. So cute that you made a crow friend and he enjoyed coming to hangout.
I REALLY LIKE THE CABIN. I'D LOVE TO SPEND TIME THERE. YOU'RE A GREAT VALUABLE  ROLE MODEL FOR THE KIDS IN THE YOUTH GROUP.
Odin likes you!
Nice👍
Be careful. Bears have been known to hunt people.
You're awesome!!! I just stumbled across your channel by accident,iv subbed and am loving the videos!! Thank you so much!!! God bless 😊!!
WOW! Love it!!!
This is awesome. I want to build a similar one in the states
I think the design of the cabin is quite good for its intended purpose.  Nice job and great video.
Love the cabin would you consider coating the out side wall in clay/mud during the summer to make it a little more thermal resistant?
I want to see how this cabin is doing in 2018
I understand what is meant by the description. But if you exclude the value of the resources you put in just because you didn't buy them from a company in your cost calculations then you can build a skyscraper for 0 dollars.
that coffee table though.. 06:28
Nice!
very nice work! i am impressed! i used to build homes! good job!
you walk fast and make funny noise, too!
Nice job your lucky here you have to pull permit for wiping ur arse.  Once a week they gather to make new codes.
That’s cool man.
Quite easily one of the top 3 cabin videos for me. Great job!
Fantastic buddy, best way to keep it simple. I like it, these other flashy things cost 10times more and cut you off from nature. 😊
this guy must be canadian lol.. "pro-ject"
What are Canadian laws about building cabins  ? I'm in Alberta . Plenty of crown land out here . Can I build cabin without permit ?
Your commentary is AWFUL!! Why explain your decisions to the viewers?? Also the whole bird story👎
…11For no one can lay a foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, 13his workmanship will be evident, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will prove the quality of each man’s work.…  -1 Corinthians 3  Prepare your work outside And make it ready for yourself in the field; Afterwards, then, build your house.  -◄ Proverbs 24:27 ►  The Lord said:  My child; Satan goes disguised as an angel of light to deceive many, and together with the Rebel9 he will confer great honours on those who will acknowledge him, by giving them wide authority and by farming out the land at a price;   http://www.tlig.org/en/messages/710/
Good job brother
What part of Canada is this?also how did you lug all your things plus, lumber?😀
You donated it but it's still in your property?!?!
Type in: Forgotten Roman Law.  enjoy
wow, seriously beautiful (: amazing craftsmanship, thanks for sharing
You said you haven't been there 4 season's yet last year you where there without a camera...??
Very, very cool and inspirational.  ThNks for sharing.  Hope you enjoy your cabin for many years.
Why would you build and then leave it for four years, I'm homeless and would love to live there
Do you miss it?
Don't tell him but it's definitely not the same crow lol
How did you do it without permits? We are in alberta and they want thousands of dollars in permits.
Starts showing the inside at 6:00
Nice job. Please send me an e mail at parsonsbradley73@gmail.com thanks from: bradley parsons from washington state usa
I’m so excited to read such positive feedback for your cabin home video. Thanks for sharing this with all of us. I enjoyed this so much.
I just CAAAANNNT TAKE THE CUTENESS OF THIS VIDEO!!!!! Your respect for nature  animals is just adorbs😥😥😥👏👏🙌🙌😻😻😻
Interesting very nice job on a cabin my recommend you insulate the top of it would probably better for you then also that Crow is actually maybe a raven cuz crows are family-based birds he would be with more than one bird and a raven are actually solo so you might look at that more clearly but by the way nice job.
you should be proud.
I’d never fault something so beautiful! Great job : )
Interesting that other people have this kind of interaction with crows. Love the cabin.
Man look so cool
I love that: "Simple is more! mentality :)
this structure is just perfect for sauna
11:08
Good One!
LOVE it
i think all the Americans who refuse to work and live for free should watch all of your video's  ever day all day
it's really pretty...love it
but how do they have a lan party tgere?
crows are pretty smart actually.
I swear this has been on a tv show
BRAVO. RESPECT.
The crow definitely recognized you
Do you rent out the cabin or does the church group?  cool cabin!
Where in Canada? I have lived in Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia.
"No permit required OUTSIDE HUNGARY" u mean...
I could live in that...
i know a guy that saws straight threw tree logs without a chain saw!
Cool.
I wish I lived in Canada
God Bless you within the coming year. j
wow that's nice I love log cabens ^^
I had a raven male and female pair come visit me on my front end loader where I worked in a rock quarry everyday on the dot at noon for lunch I'd throw them a couple chunks of crust  or pieces of meat from my sandwich, and they finally got to the point where they land on the railing of my loader when they come visit me.
Good job bro!
Great cabin, great little project.... Very Sad you did not take the time to build your house on the rock... or in this case a proper foundation. None of the rest of it will matter as much as the foundation.... oh well, to late....
**No permit required huh? How did you manage that Buddy?? Location?? Or How inquiring minds would like to know. Good Job Buddy**
Beautifull!
Great job, Pastor! Thank you for being a true witness for Christ the Lord!
beautiful sceanery and location. Gppd job....dont understsand the video however.
"always good seeing an old friend ...even if he is an old crow" love it haha
Have door reversed to keep bears out
No permit required that might depend on where you live. This country has turned full-blown Nazi you need permits to take a shit. Thank you liberals for needing a permit for every damn thing you need or want to do in your own yard.
what happens to the logs when u dont dry them? And I see u also did not remove the bark. Can u explain why? Gr8 cabin! Looking to build somtehing like that myself
Wonderful! 💞🌹
Love it!  Beautiful cabin and Charles is cool!! Absolutely awesome!!
I think it's awesome , great job enjoy the quiet and nature you earned it.
Beautiful country, beautiful cabin, beautiful video. Thanks for sharing, brother!
That's awesome man glad you found a friend ow and crows bring you gifts wen they begin to recognise you anything shiny so keep your eyes out for that
Where is this land? I own a high desert homestead but a summer getaway from our hot summers.
Imagine a small village of these. Build one every couple years, slowly build a small camp ground man retreat for yourself and some buddies. That's my dream
can i come be your apprentice or companion
Am i the only one who noticed hes wearing jeans in the snow?
just asking: what chainsaw you used in building your cabin and its hp?
Nice one, I wonder what it would look like inside in the dark with that lamp on, I bet it would feel really cozy. Just one question, how  warm is it inside without any heating and have you made a place for a fire place or something like that?
fuck the church/es part though (:
Very cool.What a way to relax.
at least in the winter you have an ample beer fridge lol
You did a great job on it and the view you have is priceless.
I agree Will Terry. I believe who cares what others think? If the situation makes you happy and works for you that's all that matters. Great job it looks great.
THAT'S AWESOME BRO, GREAT WORK.
Very very neat and beautiful.  No stove?  I loved everything about this cabin.
I LOVE your attotude!  It is perfect in its imperfections!  Perfection is ober rated,  and unattainable.  Love the front door!
Great video . Looks good man ,   Just remember the 1's that are trying to drag us down are beneath us .  Have a good 1
Very cool video!!! I love it
Wow. Good job man. Really well done!
I didn’t catch where this was at?
Wears the bathroom
Great video.
Love it!
IT IS NOT MINUS 20... HES IN A SWEATSHIRT AND PANTS
You sound like Kevin Costner
Awesome project. Just need some weather stripping for the door and some felt for your roof. ;)
👍Everything I see this video, I love it. 💞
That’s really cool, I think it looks amazing , I’d love to make one myself :)
Another job well done!
Absolutely love it!
can you buy the land it's on for $500 bucks?
you should add music when you were leaving the cabin
I've watched this video several times.
Well, it was a good run. You had me until when you said you were in a cult. cya
Breathtaking views 🦅
Dude, this is really cool!  The fact that people still want to build little cabins like this in the bush well into the 21st century is wonderful.  I thought cool people like you died out back in the 70s.  You inspire me, sir!
Simplicity is the best.  Live free and enjoy whatever we do. Depend less on money and (wasteful) stuff they push you to buy or spend on.  Congrats on the accomplishment on the log house, looking great!
Global Warming
Badass video man I wanna do this one day
6:19 fuckin' squirrels!!!!!!!!
Awesome cabin dude and you had so much fun building it and staying in such beautiful country would be my dream, Enjoy!
tf you have to get a permit to build on your own land?
AMAZING!
no sasquatch came by yet ...
Let me give you some advised take a paint brush and paint your log's Whit used motor oil that will protect them for a Long time
I just saw Dick Pernekke run out the back
Why not build in warmer months?
Could I live there please I'll take care of it
Nice log cabin.  Very attractive.  I do take issue with the roof support on the front.  Seems kind of obvious. The support columns should have been run to the ground rather than back to the house.  Safety first.  Otherwise, well done.
Very hard worker and simplicity is the best character.  I love your strong good value and you won't back down for what you think is best and working for you.  Hi, to Dad also.
how did you chose your location and what you wanted? not to mention where you bought the tools? i just graduated and got a 9-5 and so overwhelmed i am thinking of retiring around 50 and living like this build my own cabin no government owing no corruption good old school living off the land i am really considering doing this because society is disgusting nowadays
How's whaching in 2017
Simplicity at it's best. Love the cabin. :)
I love it!!
I like it.
I am exhausted just watching!
Man you built a dream world for yourself! Get your dog, get your gear and your whisky and live there forever! Congrats brother!
I DIDNT SEE NO GAPS
DO YOU RENT IT OUT FOR FREE, WHEN YOU MOVE OUT, AND LEAVE WHEN YOU COME BACK. CALL 909-461-5737, MANUEL & MARIE
Today all politicians work for the system Not the People!. Their agenda to get control of the people, By taking away your rights!, Outlawing or get a permit { Here is a few things } Having a garden, Keeping seeds to use next spring , Storing water, Building a home or shed, Then give you part time jobs - low wages,  Go beg for food stamps to survive,  High $$$ health care, For you weed smokers Selling you your weed that has a strong smell so your car an home smells like it So the Law will smell it, Get you for more of your money or take away your freedom, Tax you when you get paid then tax you when you spend it. One day you will say dang He's right when it hits you in the face!  It's easier to lie to the People than it is to tell the People they been lied to.
You haven't been therein four years but yet you followed by a lynx last year
That is simple and beautiful! Beautiful woods it's surrounded by also. I don't know where you are, but parts of Pocahontas County W.V look like that. Great cabin and great simple video.
Votre phrase "Simple offers freedom" est presque une bombe - énergisante! Je ne sais pas si elle vient vraiment de vous, mais elle est puissante. Merci!
Stunningly beautiful log cabin!! I love the photography and your narration. Thanks for making the videos : )
What state is this
Good for you!!!. Wish someone could build me one
And you thought you owned your land. The govt set you straight on that, didn't they! I'd love to walk around with someone who live 200 years ago so they could see exactly how "free" we are today. He'd see how you need a permit or license for EVERYTHING and then laugh at us for how "free" we thought we were.
Primitive technology wanna be
OK great , by ..
Simply wonderful!
Thanks for sharing!
What a wonderful story Pastor.
How did you transport the furniture to your cabin.? Great Job🍄
You're awesome!!
Looks great to me.  Nice place to retreat from the outside world.  Add a few solar panels and you could have some electricity to charge your devices etc.
i really like it .  my grandparents lived in one similar with four children .  i never saw it because was raised in Europe but i always dreamed about it .
chainsaw! good ol' hand power lol
Governments everywhere are trying to make homelessness illegal, and then they also want to prevent them from building simple homes.
Can you make one for me near-by?
If you had built it 12x12 who would know? It looks great.
I love it!!! Great job bro!
nice  i want to build my own tiny house and i'm 13  this has been the most helpful one
I love it!
This is honestly a beautiful little video! Not only does it show your hard work and effort to make such a beautiful little cabin but during the time you were working you found peace in nature and even got to connect with a little crow named Charles! think that’s honestly beautiful ..  and on top of that you donated The cabin. What a great outcome!!
oh god i love this cabin!!! so cute and cozy.
How did you transport all the furniture  for your your cabin>
What did the inside look like???
it's beautiful..i love it..
It’s awesome! I don’t understand how you can have 1000 dislikes? What’s wrong with people! I could live there 💕
I love this..maybe one day i can find a way to get land and build my own for me and my 2 kids. My brothers are in alaska i want to visit. This is awesome. Thank u for the video God bless
Well done.. Kinda makes me wanna build one.
"-20c temperatures" *walks in jeans and no hat*
surprised the estate of Charles Kuralt  hasn't complained to youtube...
Beautiful, just beautiful.  Good job!
10:43 I thought this one was your Cabin?
Wow! Now that's getting back to our roots- Good job man, that's awesome! This really makes me think of Minecraft.
nice work mate
"simple offers freedom" ................perfectly spoken.
i saw that roll up the rim you canuck!
Ew, Canada
What I wanna no is how the frick did u hike there with a couch
Must’ve been a bitch walking back to grab that camera
I love how you captured that sunlight filtering through the snow!
That's my dad
just amazing, good  for you , like watching videos of people creating/building their own homes.
well I like your cabin
Awsome job. Those door gaps can be easily remedied with som stick on dor gap seal.
I can imagine being there alone at night reading London's Call of the wild. Thanks for uploading this.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HOME
God is not re......
Nice video
Sorry but that roof hangover just doesn't fit the house ........ and maybe get s better roof in general
nice job!
Poor man's Dick Prenike
I keep wondering, almost all these small log cabins have a front "porch" or "overhang" in the front, with the loft area often used for a sleeping area. Wouldn't it make more sense if you are going to make the roof, loft and gable that long, just make the  footprint of the cabin the same size and have that "porch" area enclosed for more living space, with minimal extra effort and materials? Seems like the "sleeping loft" area would be warmer that way also....maybe I am missing something?
Is this near Letterkenny?
Bears also hibernate so not really a problem in the winter.
Can this be anywhere in America
Awesome cabin. Great job.
I've always wanted to do exactly this. build a small cabin, far away from people, to just go and do my own thing.
Really the best true story i have heard in a long time.Lots of positive very cool parts it.Thanks for sharing.
I built one on my own property and the Sheriff told me I had to have a mailing address for emergencies  is that's true?
how tall is the top of your roof?
ur accent screams Canada. lol. Am I right?
i think its pretty dope n did a hell of a job considering he had only a $500 budget. That's bad ass, I'll take two!!!
You are a disciple of Chirst my good man and one great carpenter. Cheers to the cozy cabin in the Canadian forest! Love the song that went along with the slideshow BTW.
Beautiful project.
nice..does it have a washroom that you can take a dump?
-20! Bullshit. That temperature windows are complete frozen, breathing is visible and snow sounds different under the feet
Okay if i come sleep over there?^^
If I could find somewhere to live free in a cabin I would leave Uk , but people follow :(
Good for you man!!!! Great story, great cabin, amazing soul you have, journey on!
Shout out to my boy Charles.
i can't believe all the down-votes... may i speak for them?  this is what i have to say on all the down-voting's behalf:  we are dumbasses.  we are douchetards and will likely be the first ones to perish and become food for wild lynxes to chew up and drag our greasy guts to their young kits...  there, i said it.  now let me speak for myself:  epic awesomeness right there!  thumbs way up!
Great job
But love the cabin so much i going to have my own
Dude yo voice is really slow u pause and pause too many commas!
Wha
Ok
7:47 lemme smash
global warming
Crows are smart af, it's kinda creepy how smart they are.
happy to hear he loves his church
This is the coolest thing I’ve seen in a while. Good work.
Plot twist: the Crow is a female and Hates its name
I love this!! What an awesome cabin
7:47 Odin is watching and gives you his blessing. You will reach Valhalla.
Beautiful
Why didnt he need a permit?
How much would it cost to get some internet set in that tiny cabin
Very cool
Why would you build something if you're not going to live in it?  I don't understand.  It's a cool place though.   Way to go.
Charles ❤
pity about the rodents...im sure it smells like piss in there cos of them
Great build be proudLuck Mcbain.
Ahh, there's something very spiritual about nature. Loved your photos! What music at the end?
well you know what they shaw in the PNW: april showers bring april snow.
Did I miss you saying where----generally speaking----the cabin is located?  Big snow in April makes me wonder.
great video inspiring
Very relaxing vid. Excellent cabin!
this is more of a vlog than an explanation for how he did it just fyi he mostly just rambles on a bunch of Christian bullshit chruvh stuff
are you autistic?
Beautiful cabin and video. God bless, thanks.
Crows are clever things and inquisitive
We have carpenter bees where I live
Amazing arquitect. Looks simple
I hope one day i will have the privelege of building something like this for myself. I do commend you for donating it to the church. God bless you
I knew I had seen your videos before and it was cause of the cabin 😊😊😊
Charles was my favorite part of this video. Good job on the cabin too.
Alright , wild America . get to the freaking meat and potatoes already .
Just to let ya know crows can live any where from 7-15 years.
Preacher built a sugar shack.
It's technology great. Seems like you're  really living off the grid....lol
Great vid, narration and service to youth
cool geeza ❤
God has indeed blessed you,"He who life's filled with gratitude to God has lived a full life"…carry on.
No link for next video. :(
I for one really like your cabin. That being said.... it's your cabin ... who cares what others think! More power to you.... good luck to you!!!!
ahh, so many warm feelings after watching your video, that's the right way to make new friends indeed, God bless you and your friends and best luck from me :-)
All of the global warming must have forgotten this place!
In my shitty country even that cabin would need a building permit.
7:26  Mom: CLOSE THE DAMN WINDOW YOU'RE LETTING ALL THE COLD IN
Great video and cabin!
Anyone else get "Dances with Wolves" vibes when he was talking about the crow? :)
Charles won me over for sure ♡♡♡
I need to buy a little piece of land somewhere in the North just for shits and giggles
Awesome job you did there , bro ! Respect!!!!
Charles..awww... we raised pet crows when I was a kid. We sure loved our pets crows. My Dad gave them a little beer sometimes. lots of fun.
Can't see the harm in building a log cabin..it's only wood stacked up in a pile really,not harming no  one ,as it could easily be demolished. In the UK,you can't pass wind without getting planning permission first.
Bleak but beautiful...
Beautiful, man, just beautiful!!!

One can never own true title... only color of title... why?  Because the so called 'money' that is in use can never pay anything off as it is a debt instrument.  All of our dollars are just adding more debt.  Homes aren't normally bought with gold or silver but rather with debt.  How can one ever buy anything with debt?  All you are doing is zeroing out the balance of debt when making a full purchase, but you can never own something that you never paid for.  We rent the so called money from those that control the Federal Reserve.  America has not had its own money in a long long time.  Just collector commemorative coin is produced from the Treasury for actual American money and to make matters worse America is incorporated and Canada is incorporated under that corporation.  You probably know the corporation better by the name 'District of Columbia', but it has taken all of the names you are used to using... United States of America, etc... bottom line, the corporation owns all and is the largest corporation in the world.  AND Yes, it totally sucks because they feed off of your energy of your life.  Vampires that united against you and I and call us 'Enemies of the State'.  One can make up all the reasons one wants in support of why taxes do good and pays for the services we use, etc... but the truth is we were never supposed to pay any tax at all - Ever!   Why?  Because originally ALL of the services were to be paid from import fees and through the Peoples bank where anyone that needed a loan would pay the loan and interest to the bank of the People which would support all government and even down to the city services needed for a civilized society.  Instead, the bulk of the monies get paid to the foreign federal reserve corp. which then distributes those monies back to basically its owners.
this is so cool, please keep posting vids!
That is so cool!  Well done and great to donate to your ministry.
Ok how did you get that bed and dresser up there ?  It's cute.
It's beautiful hard and slow to drive in but beautiful to look at ,It's so nice and quiet and clean air. You have an amazing story telling voice you should do stories for children .
Where is your sidearm?
the frozen sap is cool
but can he play minecraft
LOVE THIS VIDEO!  Freedom indeed!  So serene and beautiful up there. I grew up in Wisconsin and now live in California where it doesn't snow.  I miss the solitude of the snow covered wilderness at times.  The cabin looks great and the fact that you made it available to the youth group is even better!  Well done!
Freedom
I thought u r d only builder. Good thing you have companies.  Great work. I remembered my father in you coz he built a tiny nipa hut (Philippines) without spending anything. He just got the materials from the woods and all.
Your front door is almost see-thru , and isn't even close to being rodent-proof...I bet your couch is a mouse hotel  (with NO vacancies).    Not being a hater, just making an observation
$$$$$
id like to smoke weed on that cabin .. 😊😊😊
Dude you a so freaking bliliant
is it me or is that one log kicking his ass..u need help buddy. and now your acting like thats the same crow
Not very self critical
Nice log cabin, you did a good job with it! Great idea donating it to the church too.👍 I don't really know how I found this video. Anyway I must say something about Charles when I saw him I knew I should share this. It may sound odd, doesn't make it untrue and though. Charles was  monitoring you, witches often used animal's to monitor people, why you're being monitored I don't know. Be watchful and prayerful ask the Holy Spirit he will tell you. Pay attention if you keep seeing the same animal following you, watching you then that's what is going on. I know it sounds strange but,  Pray then you will know!  God bless you!☺
I just love this, what a great attitude and the simplicity.
FREEDOM.
Good job.thank's
How long did this take to finish? Could you have done it alone ?
Those teens gonna use it for sex
What ever happened to Charlie?
Most of us do not suffer from mental illness.  For the truly smart, foreclosure properties are the best buy.  Otherwise, you better be packing a rife, bowie knife, and eat bears for breakfast.
Looks lonely as hell. I don't know. I'm not really a people person, but... I guess it's a good getaway. Live there permanently and I'll call you crazy. Don't care what anyone says about me either.
If someone starts criticizing you, just say “works for me”
Gay
really nice story, good job!
Yeah I dont believe you spent 500 on all he wood
You live in Canada? That's so cool I do to. I wish you Good luck on your future ventures and voyages
You're like a real dude, man
Whose land did you build that on?
That was awesome, Brother. I fail to understand people who don't appreciate simple things in life which uplifts your spirits
what province or territory is this. minus 40 or 50 in April is that with wind chill factor. that does look cold for April. I'm in fort mac Alberta and even us now have almost full thaw by April. when I was a kid in the 80s we only had thaw in Mau June July and August but not anymore. it's about 6 months of wi tier six of non winter I guess you could say...lol. I'm guessing you must be north of 60th parallel.
impressive cabin
I really think anyone who disliked this is just simply jealous. Great job man your living the dream.
im loving the bush project its the. american dream id say u can work from home these days and so why dont the banks let loos a little live off the land i say .fuk the city.
we dont care about Charles
There's something absolutely plain about this and that's what makes this such a gem. Amazing job.
40 BELOW?  Holy crap!!  I get pissed when it hits 40 in the mountains of central Arizona and head to the Caribbean for 3 months every year.  Id rather get re-circumcised than live somewhere that is that cold!!
Always wondered how the Unabomber got his idea.
Looks like $500 well spent on this project to me, great place to be.
what area of canada is that?
Are there really 20 thousand people looking to build a cabin? I thought there were more lazy people than that this generation. Then again they might all be from my mom's generation.
What state are you in ? Not state of mind, but Minnesota or ? Just curious...
Awwwww SAweeet :) Shared with my four adult kids :)
I'd like to do something like this, getting those youth out in the woods with me sounds like a great time, especially if we did over nighters. I think I'll become a child moleste.... I'm mean youth pasture.
Why don't you just make some rough shake shingles? It's time consuming, but you can have a free roof that will last you a lifetime, and look good.
Thats a nice door
inTexas if your not in the city limits you dont have to have permits for building
Greatly done
cool music
Man id love to live there. You did a great job
It's lovely, thank you! I'm building my off-grid home with earth-bags this fall. I like you're idea but man, did you freeze??
nice job
You are awesome. Love it. Thank you for sharing this. Praise the Lord for your hard work.
Well done!
What should I ask for to get the round logs for the main structure of the cabin? I want to go with a similar aesthetic to your masterpice but I don't now what to ask for/where to go.  Love your videos!
I'd like to know more about Charles
death is the ending of the known(":
You have a beautiful monastic retreat !
Now I just need friends and I'm set...   ;_;
I like your cabin. Great for a get away. I hope you have many years there.
that's so cool if love to do this one day
Dandy project. When it comes time to replace your plastic tarp you might consider using E.P. D. M. synthetic rubber.  You can get it for free  (used) from commercial roofing contractors when they replace it with new material. It would just go into a landfill anyway. It can be attached with screws and plates easily. Even though it is used it will last for many years. cheers!
Think about what you could do with a couple hundred workers.    When we have no money, it's funny how we lose the ability to organize, but I think there is a way.
Why do canadians say prowject instead of project anyway great video good inspiration
That is so kool! If I was a Dude I would have built one like that! Perfect! 😎👍
you just had to bring god into it
30
COOL VIDEO, THANKS
I love it and agree simple is better
Very nice looking tiny home.
cool story man! and what a great little cabin you built!
it makes me miss Alaska so much!
this is so cool
I love your humor. You make me laugh quite hard. Your cabin is very nice, and is something I get inspired by. :) Good luck to Charles and you!
build another one?/ you had the best location what were you thinking donating it...???
should have kept it ...
Global warming ej
Coolest Man! That cabin is CHOICE! That has always been my dream! Thanks for sharing! Maybe I can be there one day!
that turned out nice you want to sell your cabin on land contract or rent to own
Such gorgeous scenery!
You could actually still put footers under the corners easilyand make it last a lot longer
your cabin look amazing good job man
How did you get all the lumber to the cabin location? Same question for the couches?!
no insulation? must be pretty cold
FYI.  That 10' by 10' is measured to the horizontal projection of the roof.  So that means that large overhang in front should be included in that measurement.  Nice Cabin, though.
Chinking would have preserved this cabin for ages to come.

nice
This is truly beautiful and i would definitely spend a year or more there
real nice!
Who cares about people who make it their profession to find faults in anything.  This is the population that doesn't think or evolve humanity or even contribute to society.  They exist only to remind you how thankful we have a temporary lifespan.
How awesome! You did a great job.
This reminds me of the opening scenes of an episode of supernatural. Seriously though...it's beautiful, but I would feel a certain anxiety from the isolation.
Omg ,will you make me one if I give you $ FOR  it ? I'm a widow but I want to live in the n e
I wish I could do something like this in Florida, the everglades would be such a cool spot to build a little house or cabin.
why didn't u use an ax?
how could a thousand people dislike this??   I love crows!!
I love this,  great job! you did awesome
why are so many Americans living like true Canadiens?
How are you supposed to replace the bottom row of logs when they begin to rot? Take the entire thing apart?
Everytime I'm on the street, I go 7:52
It sucks! It's terrible! No, it's awesome. Just kidding. There are always naysayers.
have you done a update to this cabin like how its looking since you made this  video?
What did the church do with it and why don't you live in it?great job btw!!
how
Like a lil Grizzly Adams theme?
song at the end?
I was thinkin wow, how remote... Until I saw the full size couch.
nice cabin!! simple is better sometimes!
yes, you don't need a permit , because you in the mountain
ther's no food.  You are the food man.
Simple offers freedom. And no matter what season your in its always winter over there bro
Kids in your church's youth group now got a place to smoke up
I love that you first built a box, then cut the doors and windows.  Much easier than trying to measure and cut logs and then assemble.
Did You Homested? Did You Save Your Money? Or Did You Use Mommy And Daddies Hard Earned Money? It's  One Of The Three! Whoops! There Is A Fourth, Steal It? (The LAND!) Not The So Called $500.00 You Supposedly Used Of Your Own* Money? To Build.....?
How Much Money For The Land?
I loved this.
I really like you from what I see here. :D
How did you pack-in the furniture and cut lumber
Oh wait we do pay rent
After listening I realized the Link isn't missing
I Love It! thanks! God bless
I love charles
youre style building house is like lego its too different where i lived
I would definitely NOT have a big fluffy couch in this cabin.  I would prefer something like slabs of rubber on a wood (box for storage) base.  Also, the mattress for sleeping would have to be rubber or some type of material that bugs and dust and mites and mice could not possibly burrow into, but I would still get the benefit on not sleeping on a completely hard surface, just have a little bit of "give" -- Is there such a thing as a "Sailer's Bed"???.  milka The-Best-IS=BE/Coming -- BringItOn
Nice video, nice cabin. One thought: don't keep aiming the camera at the sun.
Cute little cabin.  I enjoyed your story.   I'd love to have one in the woods like that in the summer to get away once in awhile.  A little solitude.👍🏻🤗
This is so seriously cool!!! Ive watched this time and time again. Love it!
where is this at?
I absolutely adore your cabin and Charles.  that's soo cool. animals are amazing. you did a fabulous job! be very proud of the hard work you put into 5his beautiful creation!
I want to go to go to exile as a Catholic too
LOVE THE VIDEO , THANK YOU
Somebody's Been Watching Dick Prenikey  sorry think I misspelled his lastname
Question: Why is it white people like living out in the middle of nowhere? I'll wait.....
You did it and never used it now that's a waste
how u brought the sofa there?)
this is so cool you sure us your talents that God gave you 👍👌🤗🐣🐰🐇that collection about Charles the old crow friend 😎👏👏
Looks good
Well there's my dad my retirement home
nothing sexier than a handy man ;) marry me! <3
great video, really inspiring actually.
ron swanson would be proud
I bet your dumbass didn't even let those logs dry out
Good Job👍
beautiful work.. can you build me one here in Utah?  How much wound it cost? I'm day dreaming..lol
Great video, man. Very inspirational!! I hope you have fun and find more happiness !!
Call
A quarter century is not a long time for the amount of work you put into this. Why didn't you do it to where it would last for the century?
Aww Charles definitely remembered you.
just awesome!
Can you say...monotone?
I think this is absolutely beautiful. Even the scene with the crow was heart warming. I plan to build a nice little cabin in the woods nearby. I hope it all works out
Thank you for sharing this attitude of enlightenment!
youth group pastor deep in the woods with a group of youth. all in cabin together. whistling hymns
this is so nice i would love to live here just give me a Sako 375h&h and a ruger alaskan 454 casull!
-20 but wearing jeans, genius!
Nice, looks pretty cosy.
10 feet by 10 feet? That's plenty of space! Especially since you could build a seperate building if you really needed one.
adorable
I really enjoy watching your videos. I find them to be very inspiring. thank you for taking so much time to document your adventures and sharing with all of us.
In the UK you have to get planning permission to live in a trailer or motor home if you intend to spend more than 30 days per year living there. Needless to say this is of course nearly impossible, and GOOD LUCK trying to build a simple cabin on land you "own".   Fuck this country.
I'd like a cabin like yours. $500. Okay. 👍
I love it it's perfect it's really all you need in life.I love living the simple life.Very nice video
nice job. good mind set.
outstanding !
Nice cabin...Needs a Jacuzzi...
Just a thought but if you made the door pull to the outside vs. push to the inside wouldnt that help to make it bearproof?  Assuming strength of the wood was solid enough, it seems that would make it difficult for any wildlife without an opposable thumbs to break in.
Really nice video, very calming. Good job with the house :)
this is one of my dreams to accomplish when i grow up. Not to mention that your a youth pastor! my passion is to work with kids when i grow up too! @OutsideFun1
How DARE you abandon Charles?! After you left, he visited every day thinking "surely today will be the day he comes back," only to be heartbroken once again. And even after all that torment, upon your return, he was still there for you.
Nice Cabin :-)  I almost froze to death just watching 😅
Someone will always bitch and moan,nothing better to do.
gorgeous and simple!
Simple is awsome and you did a great job , Thanks for sharing...May you enjoy all the time you spend there and may nature accept you in their territory and as you respect them may they respect you..Im sure they like the idea also...cause your not hurting or killing them or ruining their land..OH you know what i mean ...Thank you for sharing..
How come there's no permit for it but you need a permit for others? And assuming you had to purchase land? How much is that ?
what the hell's this guy talking about,building a cabin and not needing a permit?? anywhere in Ontario and Quebec,a permit is needed,not only to build,but there are yearly taxes to pay,which in turn gives you a permit that MUST be tagged onto the cabin facade.no tag = forest authorities burn down cabin. but once tagged/licensed,each cabin is located on an MNR (ministry of natural resources,ontario) map. same in Québec. simple: our land is the feds land and they regulate it. guess who i work for?
Please, please do not make permit requirements about Liberals.  I am a liberal and there was a time when I had 10 acres that I put some dwellings and buildings on without permits.  Discrimination is needed, yes.  Otherwise someone could move in next door to you and put in a car dump, a toxin producing business, or anything else they desired.   If you are wise, you can do some things without permits if you do not offend your neighbors.  (They most likely are doing the same thing.)   We were called in to the county once by an evicted tenant (who got evicted for doing some unpleasant things).  We got a letter from the county but just waited it out and nothing happened.   It isn't about getting money for the permits.  It is more about preventing enormous problems.  Look at Mexico and India.  They have slums that expand right next door to nice homes.  That is why we have permit requirements.
I'd love to do this. Too bad I don't own any land in the Canadian wilderness... or anywhere. :(
hey Dude you could always jack the whole cabin up with a 4 tonne truck jack later on and get it off the ground and dig some footings . good vid , more young bloke should do this
Very interesting. Nice that you donated it back for the kids to use.
50 below? He's bareheaded...
nice cabin well done.
My solution for this stupid 10'x10'  structure RULE:  Right nextdoor, build another 10x10...behind that, build another 10x10.  You could build a "set it up each visit" connection betw them all or just step outside and go into next "room".  Ha !
Amen, Matt de Oliveira (comment below) !  I recently learned about Slab City, Arizona.  Americans are starving for freedom.  The rules-n-regs in this country have gotten outta hand.  In rural America, there should be no "Oh, you can't do that on your property" nonsense.  Love your cabin.  Hey, when you have a few bucks, buy that Orange Termite B Gone stuff by the gallon and pour it over the lower logs near ground !  It might stop infestation.  And, it might turn off certain animals of the wild.  That was scary....that linx following you and if not for her footprints in the snow....you would have never known. Geez, dude !
This is amazing!!!! Id love to get in contact with you. Many questions
Good job.  I built a couple of small log cabins when I was a kid and know how hard the work is.  Very good for the church youths as well.  Kids need a lot more hands on these days or they will be lost.
To tell you the truth - there's several very profound reasons why this structure would be much better, more peaceful and more private then four modern man-made walls.
I would have loved to see you build it without any power tools
You are a habitual liar get a grip fs
good job
Why don't you caulk the gaps in the door?
Umm why you had builded this if you had moves right away?
Is dis low key for like just Detroit too maybe? No permit like that. We got dem woods on Belle Isle like that....
fuck living in a damn freezer
Very nice! Thank you for sharing.
Where are you located sir?
Did you have anyone help you build your cabin...
you are reakly great . i loved it
You did a superior job building the cabin thanks for showing it.
I keep seeing this video up and the vid is good - but every time I see the title of the video it gets me pissed off.  In my country, and most of them, you can't just run around building structures anywhere you please  !!!    It's sort of like all these stupid people who toss up videos about how proud they are that they built their own house and how they're not a "slave to the man!"  Blah, Blah, never once mentioning that they got the land for free, or its family land, etc.   Without legally owned land - yer screwed !!
Always the top attic is misery! just like a grave for a live person in an isolated forest! Do you have parents to visit them, Look after them??  What did the Bible said about parents? I'm sure you have no clue!!
I love this house~!!!
Awesome
Where is it located? It looks like Alaska, I live there.
It's a shame that you need to defend to certain people what you've done here, I think it's solid for what you need and the location is beautiful
How warm is it in the winter? How cold in the summer? How do you prevent termites and carpenter ants?
I liked this. Your narrative is a lot like the late and wonderful Grizzly Adams I used to watch as a young boy. The pacing, transitions and styling were reminiscent of his. Were you influenced by him at all growing up? I was. His ways taught each of us who would pay attention, a deeper, more meaningful purpose about life and why we live it, the true inner joy about connecting to nature and the purpose of paying every living creature respect.
What church are you with? I need to be reborn, in my own cabin of course. ...And for the children.
Well done my friend. Thanks for sharing, and may God bless you.
Terrific project Rock on.
No food No bears
it's not in Chicago that's the point off grid means you do whatever the fuck you want
When I was litte we use to have a log cabin very similar to this that my grandfather built when he use to go hunting. They would make an event out of it and for for 2-4 weeks once a year. They used this .. I really don't know what to call it but they made these two wood pillars on the inside and outside of the door. They had several of these 4x8's and when they where in it they placed the wood in between the door and and pillar. When they where way they would place them on the outside of the door and the pillars there. Completely blocked off the door and they never had anything more then a few rodents get in it until a about 10 years back when they abandoned it after the roof caved in over winter. They ended up just putting a old 5th wheel styled trailer there instead.

You need to take the bark off, insects will live under it and destroy the wood and moister will be trapped underneath and wood will rot much faster..
Wow wow I love it
So Beautiful there!  You did such a good job on all....  The Filming is Nice Too!  I keep thinking, "Where's his girlfriend/wife?"  lol We Need More Young Men Like YOU! Thanks for sharing ~ Peace!
this is great!!
show
this is so cool ❤
It looks great! I remember watching the original video where you built it. I always wanted to live out in the country. Deep in the north, where it snows a lot! Is this Canada, or the U.S.? Very soon I will need a permanent dwelling. But the real problems of working , money and food cross my mind. Not to mention electricity. Or at least WiFi. Can you make some suggestions? My current poverty is frightening. Thank for posting. Greetings from Vienna.
i love to have one too 613 340 5582
Well done. I wish I could have such an amazing oportunity. Enjoy it!
I would love to have that on my hunting property
I would believe its late April because in the video description it says posted on May 2nd
Awesome cabin,but who would know anyways about it if you didnt put it on here and you could of built it as big as you want.
I fed crows in the backyard they come to nest every year them, their children, and grandchildren. Crows are smart they recognize people that feed them, and actually tell other crows. Crows and ravens are two of the smartest birds on the planet.
Where in Canada is it? like what territory, and what notable lake or town is nearby?
thumbs up big time
stop asking the governments for permission to anything people. wake up stop being slaves.
Like so many things in life,no matter what others may say in the end it really only matters to you,and that you are happy with the end result,or with what you are doing...
Finally a good intro from somebody...
what A pile of shit lies ,you must be A CNN CRISIS ACTOR........
It looks very nice. I too would like to have a nice little get away like this. Maybe slightly bigger.
There won't be bears there if you're only there in winter! They're hibernating...
What about spiders? Find any webs when you returned?
Thanks for showing us your friend Charles. Crows are amazing birds
Good photos and diagram!!!!
just great man. good job. love it!
3:31 ive been playing too much resident evil: 7. i was expecting jack to pop out the window
You sold me on this until the Church came into it.
2 years ...? ugh whose got that long to find a home ?
Awesome! I'm also a youth pastor and I eventually want to build a cabin to live in for a while to just spend time with God learning and creating. Great stuff!
Cuz it's awesome!!
You spent most of your time justifying your decisions.. like have some confidence bro
you did a great job! thanks for sharing :) say hello to charles!
i just want a place where squirrels can live with me and bird friends drop by
Very nice. I look forward to one day living a simpler life away from all that goes on. Enjoy
Great job,  OutsideFun1. I loved your video...God bless. What was the chinking you used between the logs?
Minus 20 in jeans and with nothing on your head
Great job bet it made you feel really good after you finished it n it was still there a yr. later. Very Cool Preacher Man 👍🏻🙏🏻
Freedom isn't free.  You haveta work for it.  Much respect to your plan of freedom.
Hey,  I will pay you $550.00 to build one of those in my back yard.
Is it $500.00 without having to purchase the tools to build it?
Great work man!!!
The best video on YouTube.
I'm not trying to put you down but you could have just guitar card that door it's a lot of gaps. but I understand and like you said it used to be a coffee table
Wifi?
Absolutely beautiful!!! That is my dream home, I plan on doing the same thing in the woods here, with some help from the hasbeen, lol. I truly believe it will last longer than you think! Great job!!!
Pastor that is some fine work you did.  I like the stories of the lynx and the crow,   gives it a human touch.
To make a bear proof door you make it so it opens  out.
Crows dont kno shit
Very cool great job
There must be a huge sense of autonomy there in that little cabin.
Love this video. Thank you for sharing it with us all. It makes me yearn for the great outdoors. I grew up in Northern Maine, but have lived in Southwest Florida for the last 18-19 years. My blood's thinned so much that 60 degrees is now  cause for the use of a sweatshirt.....lol.
Do you use drone for eating pizza
beautiful place.
Thank you, just a joy to watch.
Who walks in jeans in waste deep snow? Idiot!
Getting permission to build  on a piece of dirt out in the boondocks is a joke and should be banned.
I'd live in it year round..Good job.
Very cool
Nice cabin buddy. Hope you get to enjoy it for many years to come
boy howdy, you can sure nuff get a mess of solitude and a bushel or two of privacy there
I'm surprised you didn't find a subscriber squatting
its so cool
Can I nominate you for some Nobel Prize somewhere?
awesome cabin, no way no how it only cost $500 though.
This is amazing. I love this stuff. This inspires me to one day build a log cabin or little house to hangout in.
the scenery looks like a video game
that's a real nice cabin buddy
Waist deep snow, minus 25° weather...but you look some nice in those jeans lol.
Voice sounds like the YouTuber Mr. Nightmare.
God bless. Hope the kids and church enjoy this little cabin once in awhile. I'm assuming this is in BC?
shoulda atleast put Allen blocks for bit of foundation.. give ya another decade of least trouble :)
this cabin has only ONE flaw and it's MAJOR..    It's not in my backyard!!!  :0)
Awesome 👏
LOL, isn't that nice of me, I donated this little cabin that nobody would feel like even walking out to, to my youth group. hahaha
so you're really just a squatter on somebody else's land... Free Labor from kids... SO when are you going to chain  some poor unsuspecting woman up in the cabin & keep her there.... we'll wait for the next video to see if it happens have fun I like your cabin
He meant $500 for materials only.
look their is more then 500 dollars worth of wood the land cost you more then that for anybody to get their hands on that wood
I absolutely adore crows...
looks like heaven
charles be like "get off my land you damn squatter!"
Just spray some of that "Flex Seal" you see on TV to cover those slight gaps in your door.
As a civil engineer I could throw any number of criticisms at this project, but you've heard them all already. So, I just want to say; I think it's really awesome that you managed to build this thing for so little! I'm inspired. You've given me loads of ideas. I'd like to build my own, except, I don't have any land :(  I think the 10x10 foot or less limitation applies to sheds. No need to get a permit for a shed. To the people asking why people need permits - it's for the safety of the occupants more or less. I've seen all kinds of dangerous shit people have done and gotten in trouble for; permits are ultimately very much necessary.
i liked the story about charles :-)
Great job on your log cabin bro.  Please ignore any negative comments!    The good Lord has blessed you with many talents.   The cabin was amazing, but the story you told kept me wanting to know more!   Great job!
u couldn't spend the 100 bucks and shingle the roof? instead of a tarp
Great work! I would move there with a dog any day
I've seen this vid already, but its worth a rewatch
Charles is the real MVP.
Great job always wanted to live like that .Thanks for all imformation.It was great.
cabin log star date 252 niner these are voyages of the star ship enterprise
Very nice.  I envy you.  Small home, BIG freedom.
Loved the Video, Loved the Cabin, Thanks for sharing.  I always wanted to build a Log Cabin.
I wonder.if we can do.this in.U.S.A maybe.montana or Alaska does anyone.know?
He's clearly reading a script lmao
Awesome cabin and good on you for donating it to your local youth group and church take care and Godbless!
AWESOME video, very well made ❤
That story with the crow made me smile
if you dont want to spend money on stain u can use old motor oil to protect the logs but u should put something on or the rain will rot those logs out
Dick Proenneke
Cool
cool
It looks terrific, as well as the location, Is there Any toilet in there?, or When nature calls to use the toilet. .. You simply go outside?   I just can't imagine myself taking a crap with that weather and watching if any Lynx is ready to attack.
Amazing
that's awesome!! Great Job!!
That's AMAZING! I'd never wanna leave!
you must see more stars there than anyone! very cool
Great job and very informative.  And Oh My, so different from Kalifornia where I live.  All those wonderful straight uniform pine logs!  But the COLD!   As my mother told me, there is a beauty to the North Country and a certain "Freedom", but then, there's a "price" for everything, eh?  (Unfortunately  reading some of the comments is very very depressing.  Another good reason to live way out in the woods - if only to get away from the masses of stupid, lazy and downright crazy people...)
oh my god Charles
Nicely done!
no permit required. its because you aren't in the USA where the like to be a huge pain in the ass.
great video,,, nice project for everybody to learn from
Great idea. Thank you for the video and the inspiration. :)
What, no fireplace? I thought that's the whole reason for being in a log cabin to sit in front of the wood fireplace and roast your nuts.
Love how you made friends with a crow! Birds are so cool, I find!
Feel like I'm watching animal planet
Crows are some of the only birds that will remember specific details like someone's face so Charles probably did recognized you
Charles will always remember you, trust you and tell his kids about you too so they teach their offspring that you can be trusted, go visit anytime you want. I bet they squack at others who go near the cabin when your not there trying to protect it for ya man :-) Cool Job too
looks nice man i dig. wont repel the zombies tho so in the end its useless
Looks a lot like Alaska. Log cabins are fairly common there too, since they can be made from the trees that are cleared from the middle of the property. No lynx there though; just lots of angry, stressed moose and a few bears. :D
all these stories of creatures in the woods and this dudes in the middle of nowhere!
just skip the first 10 minutes unless you like Story from Mr. Rogers in the Woods
very nice
Crows are incredible birds.  Smarter than most dogs (and probably a lot of people), and amazingly adaptable to extreme environments at both ends of the spectrum.  Crows definitely weren't the bird that whoever came up with "birdbrain" was thinking of.
Birds name their kids. I wonder what Charles named you to tell his family and friends.
Awesome stuff!  Not trying to be a smartass, serious question:  is it technically "bush" country when there are still trees, even if only pine?
Hm. So you don't live there a few days even? So it was only a learning project and next time you will build one you can live in? If I got you correctly.
I think a cabin is cool because u  just need some alone time from everyone and everything need time to think and ain't nothing better than go to beautiful nature it's self
that's really cool
It's so scripted I don't like it
I think it's very awsum pard great work
the narration is good and all but i really just thought id be watching a video of someone building a cabin
it's Amazing! Well done!
what did you use for filling in between logs spray foam? I would like to know that looks great.
Well done sir!
great. video to watch h8gh
Awesome stuff!
good job
you were pretty brave to go solo. one accident could be really bad.
what a nice cabin indeed.
great video, you can. build a. good size cabin for under $2000 easy, I did it
not sure why I'm looking at a video about building a house in the wilderness that seems it's been made by PBS or BBC at 3:18 in the morning on a Friday but shit. that guitar playing style is smooth
I LIKE IT
Nice quote at 2:40, Marty Stouffer.
very cool! love it!
Hey! Charles was glad to see you
good job man...you can always add or fix up little things as you need or want to.God Bless
You did not build this. Why lie?
Lift with your legs bredren!! You'll be able to live in that cabin way way longer
The crow named Charles was telling all the other animals nearby that some dude is building a cabin in their home.
awesome!
inspirational. I pray that you find happiness
great place to hide when your a youth pastor
great job on the cabin !!! plus old Crow is better than an old buzzard any day !!!!!😕😕😕😕
Very cool and also a challemge to complete. Diligent worl sir
do you think this is possible with only hand tools?
Help me to build one for me
Great job
HELP! I need a Log Cabin for my son and I. I would be beyond happy to pay 500 !
Well this is an achievement that will last your lifetime. This is living life!
Late April? That much snow? Global warming?
The cabin is beautiful. I appreciate your efforts.
Dude, you are one strong guy!!!
Great video great log cabin but I would have done it differently I would have built it in the good weather because working in the winter is probably not that much fun.👍
lovely place!
That was an easy sub. Thank you for your share. Well edited videos
looks amazing!
I love it
spray copper sulfate (a pretreat solution) solution on the bottom logs and let it soak in the ground.   this will stop termites and fungal rot.  it is cheap. read the safety instr.
Love simple but dang squirrels. Good job!
If in California anything over 100'sq needs permit unless it's mobile
"Simple offers freedom". I'll remember this.
Wow I'm surprised you built it in the snow!
What is the (propane?) tank that's mounted up near the chimney exit?
lay heavy boards with nails point up in front of doors and windows to deter bears... they feel the points poke their feet and don't try to go further
thanks for the nice video
Loved this video, interesting to watch.
Really cool! Very nicely done!!
What a blessing for the church, and being a carpenter myself, I am guessing a joy to build.
+1 for global warming. The word must not have reached your neck of the woods. What a beautiful spot, despite the cold. Nice accomplishment with the cabin.
show the in sibe
this dude spent a day or two too long in the woods
I love this cabin. I agree simple is best. love the animals. I also agree that someone will always have something negative. I think that every thing you did was wonderful. giving it to the church and letting youth learn how. you are a wonderful man.
just wondering what kinda money was spent during build very impressed
Just awesome!
I want to live there whit muy dog and 3 cats. Happy life!
I saw the thumbnail and "$500" and thought it must be click bait, but no, it's legit. 👍  That's an awesome little place to have tucked away to "hang your hat" whenever you want. Of course to a squatter it only costs $0 and I wouldn't be surprised if it was occupied when you showed up to it after being gone a year.
Where did you get logs that were so straight though?
Did you carry those two couches through the bush all by yourself?  That's some man power alright
Very interesting.  You are very skilled.
it loks so lonely :/
Cool
Nice - but what do you do when you get there …. it would get a little boring ?
When you gotta worry about permits and code folks then you're living in the wrong part of the country. Doesn't matter wether its  Canada, Russia, China or the US.  That's the problem with big governments,this world and cities. To much control on the little folks.  I'm doubtful that no one fool of an inspector is going to go up there to check his cabin. if they do then they have more rocks and their head then they have balls their pants.
Me likes.  Off grid.
Love the story about Charles. Thanks for including it. Crows are super smart and curious. I bet he misses you.
I think everything about this cabin and the backstory is great! Good job man, I really appreciate this video!
Nice build! Good Job!
Flat out fucking liar.
Religion is lies
Growing up in Australia and watching calamity Jane and other westerns I dreamt of living in a log cabin . Now I'm older and realise with my health issues that wouldn't be possible so I live vicariously through you guys , thanks xoxoxox
I can`t begin to tell you how beautiful & majestic this scenery is!!! God is such a wonderful artist & creator!!! I would stay in that cabin all winter! Being with nature is such a wonderful blessing!God bless you, teach the youth well! Jesus saves!
This thing must be wicked cold. No insulation on the upper part? Yeesh
amazing
Congratulations on your project! That's very cool that you donated it. We need more people like you in the world. Also I love that you made a friend in Charles. We have a similar raven friend that visits us. He regularly trades bits of shiny things for our strawberries. Birds are smarter than a lot of people think!
youth group pastor is the last person i would allow my child out in the forest with. nice cabin, shitty career choice, we will always assume....
This is AWESOME! I wish I was there, and I hate cold.
Great & creative! Congrats!
Wow
sadly if it has a roof you need a permit for it out near me.
That loft and gear storage is badass man. Great job
Great Job!!  Love it
I think it would cost way more than$500.  Food and gas and tools...etc.
Wow, 2 million views!!!!!
Ive been living in a cabin made out of wooden doors for about 5 months. I have to relocate it because the landlord of the property wants clean up the field and sell it.Im in the middle of an olive grove. Its very nice and quiet. I love my home.I hope to move the doors one at a time somewhere nearby. no man is willing to assist me. oh boy. its alo of work but shure can do it! :))) Local farmers seem nice.
LAME
you did a great job no complaints here
What is the story with the Propane tank mounted up on the wall next to your stove pipe?
I think your cabin is absolutely beautiful. No excuses necessary. Freedom and independence are attainable!
Love this simplicity of this , it is a wonderful get away place
Hey man nice video! What is the name of that coat you have on in this video? It looks super nice!
good little cabin!
cool!
boys will be boys
0:34 - 0:45 looks like it could be a deleted scene from Evil Dead 2.
Can you explain to me how this build works, let me be specific you own the property that you built this on and if so you own it? Or is this like a cabin on public land that you built and claim?
they likes natural taxes in the nature 🌺🌷🐞💖
Crows can recognize faces and remember them.
BH.       POLICE.            SUNSET.
I love your home ! Gratuliere dir von Austria.

Charles is a raven not a common crow. Even the early pioneers were knowledgeable enough to make simple stone footings to set their logs on and support the structure off the soil, preventing rot and insect damage. As for the roofing, wooden shake shingles are easy to make and in this instance would probably out last the logs as built. Not impressed, however, I don't have to live it it!
I could never stand in the woods for more then 5 minutes. How the fuck do you lift heavy ass logs in knee deep snow by yourself!
Where is the cabin?What state?
very cool video and I really enjoyed how you broke down each step or areas of the construction.
great job!!!! how long do you estimate it took you to build?
awesomeness.
His narration reminds me of Marty Stouffer and Wild America.
Great job. I'm surprised the wind doesn't rip apart the tarp.
Oh man, it seemed cool until he announced that he helps to brainwash children into believing fairy tales...
this is what being American means
Very cool. Love the remoteness and homey-feel to the cabin.
simple is good.
you have inspired me to build a survival shelter for the desert, hopefully I will do it and post it up.
This is awesome man, I'd love to get out an do this. Very nice job, God bless! Cheers from Poland!
Solid month of -40 sounds like Northern Ontario.....
Awesome!
When do you plan on painting or staining the bare wood of the cabin?
perfect for a hunting cabin.
Great video. I don't think I'll ever get used to the way Canadians pronounce their O's.
anyone see that bird? I was super cute
Mate, that's an absolute beauty. Congrats on completing such a project.
omg i love Charles
your amazing man, and hey if a bear does come inside shoot it and eat bear?
it's a beautiful place man.
great narrating, thumbs up, good job bud
VERY NICE OF YOU KID
How long would this take?
I think it's just wonderful! !!  great job. it's my dream to over out in the woods and live the simple life.  hunt my own food. no technology to bug you.  I wish you many years of happiness in your little cabin.
If you dont need a permit for a 10x10 then im gonna build multiple cabins and place them just inches apart.
Sir, job well done
Sounds like you should have named the bird, Wilson.
You sir are a good human. I wish I were.
AMAZING WORK BROTHER!!! ......  BUT WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT SONG AT THE END?
Charles!!! Loll great video!!!!
no fault, great work, you only need to be satisfied to be happy
Hey Mo! How come we ain't eva seen any girls hang around here?
This is how I want to retire.
How much would a permit have cost for a 20x20 cabin? just curious.
great work.
I think it's awesome! perfect :)
Lovely. Do u think it will hold up to earthquakes?
I am envious of your cabin Sir. The serenity and beauty of the place is what I have longed for for decades. You have something that most people can only dream of. Me being one of those.  I thank you for your vision,desire and ability to build this and show the rest of us. Maybe some day I will have something close to this.
Ok,so you left it alone for 4 seasons; now what are you gonna do with it? I'm lost.
good job
Christ would be proud my brother , did you u use near by trees for the logs
God bless you Yong man. .......👌🌷👍👋🏡🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
I'm going earth-sheltered.
That's a great little cabin,placed so you can enjoy nature.I could use one of those.....Cheers!
wow amazing job what a realman great job.
There is a quality to keeping things simple.
I just love that you as a youth pastor were able to share this project with your youth group and other people, teaching them wonderful skills that they can use later, too.  And the music was especially uplifting and fun.  Then to donate it to the church who owned the land was a great idea.  Hopefully, there will be folks who will take care of it on into the future.  What a story.  I really enjoyed your video.
Hopefully my last comment will be taken as  constructive criticism.
Sorry I have to give this a thumbs down. What did we learn. Very little. I watch video without without the sound. Is all you see in the video, is maybe how to lift a log. Otherwise we see a nice view an a picture of the log cabin.
Very cool!
great job. wish I could buy some land like that and build me a cabin.
Man this is my dream. Snow, own some land in the middle of no where build my own little cabin and get away. Just curious what did you pay for your land. How much land as well.
man this is my dream.
Great video! I love that little loft.
I'm thinking that old trapper's cabins weren't much bigger than this.
You blow your back out and the cabin will cost a lot more than 500.00..
You made it happen! Nice work man!  and that guys face on 15:25 ^_^
That doesn't look simple to me you must have some skills to construct that roof. I will most likely never own land but I will definitely want to this someday.And that coffee table must of been humongous, the cracks in the door ain't nothing some pine resin and ash couldn't fix.
I love being out in nature. I think this is just awesome! Very cool little cabin. Thanks for sharing.
Any plans available?
What an awesome project. You did an amazing job. May God bless you.
You should check out the movie Happy people your video reminds me a little bit of it.
Love this place. Love this video.
I like what you've done, and think it's just all beautiful :)
real nice
Looks awesome!
it is beautiful.
"Complicated offers bells and whistles. Simple offers freedom !" <- love that
build me one.  I love it
I love this!!! we built one in the woods in NJ..not as nice as your though..good 4 u!
yeah do something about the door
come build me one
Cooooooooool!    I love it!
i dont know if you know how smart crows and ravens are, but they can certainly remember people. crows are as smart as, if not smarter than chimps in some ways. they can and do make tools and use tools, and studies have shown they can communicate very complex things to other members of their flock, like specific humans that are a threat. the members of the flock will continue to relay this information to other crows, to the point where even after the crow who originally encountered the threat has died, his family and 'friends' will continue to remember and tell other crows about the threat. another fun fact is they can learn to speak human words in the same way as parrots, but crows will usually only choose one or a few people to speak to, where parrots will speak to anyone and anything thats near by, or to themselves just for fun.  Im 100% certain that this crow or raven remembered you, especially since you would vocalize to him. he likely remembers your time together as fondly as you do, i doubt theres much entertainment for him up there.
Nice, someday I want a few of these :))). Can you just build a few 12X10' or as many as you want on the same lot? Also, DO NOT let anyone talk bad about your work. If they don't like it, they don't have to come in. If they are inside, and they said they don't like it, show them the Door... If they don't like the Door, throw them out the window. LMAO.  I have been living in the City all my life and I hate it and I hate City People as well. They don't know how to Respect other People and live Peacefully . I wished I have one of these to go to when I am down and camp out now and then. It will be soooo nice and quiet and most importantly peaceful :)). I wished you the BEST and live Life to the fullest. DO NOT let anyone in your Life who tries to get you down, NOT even your own Mother. As long you are Happy, People should be Happy for you including your Mother :D.
I'm glad this works for you.  But I'd love to know where you found a nylon tarp that last 5 to 10 years under direct sunlight
Good job and well done, you  a kind person. The raven has a very good memory and will recognize you for as long as it lives especially if you squak back and forth with it and feed it, they are know to be the smartest birds in the bird family and avian scientist's say that all black birds are in this group of "smartest birds" including the common blackbird that you find in grocery parking lots.
If you want to preserve the bottom logs or the entire log cabin you can make a fairly effective wood preservative using free used deep fry oil from a local restaurant. Take the deep fry oil and filter it through a crude screen just to remove particle of food then add 1/2 cup of powdered copper sulfate to each gallon of oil, blend real good until it is dissolved which may take some time and possibly some heating. Generously brush this oil into the ends of every log and on all outside surfaces paying particular attention to the lower outside areas, make sure to put a good 3 soakings worth and you will see how well it repels and prevents insects from entering the wood. This treatment should be done in the summer time on extremely hot days to allow good saturation. Done over at least once every 3 years can keep logs rot and insect free for decades!.
Correction, 12'x 10' or any footprint 120 square feet and under needs no permits in the state of California.
fuck off
Cool looking little place
can you build more than one cabin identical to this, and still not need a permit? great video btw
BEAUTIFUL!! The door is absolutely gorgeous!!!although ventilating isn't conducive to warm it's very handsome!
😍
Nice! I liked Charles, too
wonderful! you are very talented and creative, and clearly hardworking. Good for you!
Awesome work Dude !
Its fantastic!!
How warm is it? In the roof area I mean. If I built one I'd insulate it.
You did a great job!
Did you have a spike of views after the election?
I believe you Sir are a Good Man.That Crow was pretty cool also.
things that is so great I think that's cool also that your pastor in you donated the cabin to the youth I was wondering if you had any more property or little houses cabins for sale if so please contact me and send me an email thank you so much for your time I enjoyed your video God bless
Loved your cabin!!!😊🌺☮️
THEY FOUND THAT CROWS ARE THE CLOSET TO US AS FAR AS FAMILY AND INTELLIGENCE IN THESE VERY SMALL BRAINED BIRDS IT WAS A STUDY DONE THAT I WATCHED. IT WAS VERY INTERESTING! THIS WAS VERY SWEET TINY CABIN! LIKE IT! : )
Canadians are bloody awesome.
i have $614 in my bank account right now!!!!
The crow definitely recognized you.  They remember people.
EXCELLENT!! SIMPLE=FREEDOM!!
love this cabin... simply and beautiful...... peaceful... calm.... free..
Sadly it's too cold to stay in for at least six months of the year. I don't see a fire place in there at all.  But it would be a cute little place to stay in during a time of the year where you can comfortably stay out all day and just sleep in there.
Where in Canada is this?
good job!
There is no food only when u are not at home but if u are there you would make a bears delicious snack.
Beautiful country.  Awesome cabin!  Enjoyed the video.
this is a tranquil and quiet spot you got. Awesome work bro.
beautiful, here in NB, they tear them down. 50+yrs!
I've never seen snow in real life and I've lived in America my whole life.
Why didn't you cut the logs to length first? Rather than cut out a door (and windows?) afterwards.
why dont u use some wood puddy to fill in the gaps?
Wow! That's the kind of off the grid that I'd love to have. Love it! Where exactly is this in Canada? Blessings.
That place is fucking awesome
you'd be surprised. I read somewhere that Crows remember your face for 3 to 5 years.
Nice!
baloney that was made for $500. what a load of crap. nice job but you aren't fooling all of us
I  am  impressed.
well done!  Very fine job!
I like that philosophy of simple
Beautiful country!! NICE !
No food for the bear? Dont worry he likes white meat
Awesomeness! Simple and free(:
My family and I want to build one. We have never. Holy before and are looking for land now. Any advice?
Good stuff
why u need a permit to build u own place to live? now i understand the people that said you all are a bunch of slaves.
Very nice video sir,I enjoyed watching thanks for sharing.
A perfect place to write a novel...  lol, for a few days anyway. It's awesome nonetheless.
Nice! We  Hope to build a little getaway some day similar to what you did. Thanks for the video! Right now we are developing a small homestead/farm. The houses (two of them) will be conventional. But then we will get a saw mill and we are going to build our barn out of rough cut lumber from trees out of our forest. Gonna be a blast. You can check it out here on YouTube if interested. We will be filming for years to come.
Awesome..great Job
Does anyone else find it absurd to ask for permission to build your own house? What about having to pay rent to live in your own home?
Beautiful!!
That looks so cozy. Thanks for the video.
i'm guessing large numbers of people will start living in homes like this in the coming decade.  The current economy just isn't supporting current lifestyles.  A home like this would be far more acceptable to many than being homeless.  problem is, as more people start doing it, the wealthy will have to crack down on it because they will be losing their source of income.  Bad times are ahead.
this would be a perfect bug out cabin. I always wondered if this could be done If I bought property in the mountains. Safely snuggled away.
The narration reminds me of Dances with Wolves
Thanks for your video.  Please check out my original songs, He Wasn't Just A Dog, Go'n Downtown and Evergreen (We Remain).  Thanks for listening and thanks for your video.
This is very nice. Since you only spent $500, how much did  you buy the land for?
Great cabin, I've got a property also in northern Canada, but maybe not as for north as your property.
you can put a 100 trailers  or bigger sheds on a property as long as they are NOT  ATTACHED to the ground permanently hahaha you can build a 1000 10x 10 permanent sheds or 1 million x 1mlliion barn
you can build an unpermitted barn of any size on private property without permits ahahahha no running water or no toilets inside  qualifies..  you can build an additional 10x 10  quote living quarters with running water and toilet..  or  even just a big outhouse of  any size with running water and toilet ahahah...   theres a 1000 ways around rural codes legally
(*L.*) Thanks, Good job !
what's the  music name of last part  ? please
I personally think the simple it's not only freedom ,it's it being closer to God
Where in Canada? Would love to rent it out for a season.
You did an awesome job.:)
Cute.
that story about the crow was cute lol
Lovr it.
great job..excellent & well done..
Church? Might as well burnt it, bring some friends and girls, drink and have fun without the god particle above you
You're in the north so it's cold obviously, and this slows decay. It prohibits a lot of fungi and insects and what not from eating the logs as well.
im homeless can i have it ?
Super video!
that is so awesome I would love to have lived there
$500? sold
Coffee table door.... that's awesome!
I think it is cool as heck!
wait were is global warming...????
Excellent job on building the cabin.
cant build on crown land..this must be private property
maybe should bark the logs cuz of bugs,,but still a neat build...jda
kool kabin man...what's the propane tank above the wood stove for ????  just curious ' cause i like innovative ideas....jda
Is there a way to grow food there during the warm season?
great video
Could you not canterlever another room at the back of the cabin on the second floor? wouldn't be that much more and would add another bedroom.
Beautiful!    this is 15 mins well spent!    Thanks so much!
do you have a video that show exactly how do you build this cabin if I want to learn from it .. you have done an amazing work keep it going
It's been proven that crows recognize faces, so he knew it was you. Funny how you're a pastor who makes friends with a crow. If you disagree please tell me why.
Get a better door for Pete's sake
freedom
How much land? cost for land?
Awesome gd 4 you , Job well done.
No permission needed. Thats what I like about the US, you can just build it. Here in Germany you need lots of papers before even thinking about it. On the other hand, constructions are safer and 15 times less people die per 100.000 inh than in the US from construction failure
alots people envy and admire people like you  total freedom
I think you did an amazing job of it. I love that little table.
A Trick to tarp roofing, is to put two tarps on it, that way, even if the outermost one really degrades hard due to sun and weather, it will still protect the one underneath for a loong time. Thus when it becomes time to change the outermost one, use the old bottom one as the new top one, and put a fresh one underneath. You'll still be replacing them, but at a slower rate, only downside is a bit more expense up front for the first two tarps. And if you get really fancy, put some insulation underneath the bottom tarp as well. flamingo lasts nice if it's protected from UV rays, which the tarps would do.
really cool.  I would be tempted to remove the bark and lacker the logs.  in California bugs would get into the bark and destroy the logs after a few years.  it would definitely not last 25 years.  maybe it is different there.  it is certainly a lot more work to peel the logs.  I still think it is really cool.
How did you get the sofas up there? Trucked them as in the roof lumber? Love the idea that you built this as simple as positive. Everything does not need to last 100 years, nor is it meant to.
Wonderful! Thanks for posting. You have inspired many "dreams come true!"
screw the naysayers,you built it,enjoy it,I think its a very beautiful build
Great cabin excellent work...
AWESOME!
Probably my fav log cabin video!
you say youth group so are you LDS ?
This looks nien
that crow reminds me of that movie The Omen lol... love the cabin by the way.. would love to have one built here in my homeland New Zealand 😊
real nice I lived in a log cabin when I was young they are warm in winter and cool in summer..
I'd be scared to go in the top portion where it juts out and has pretty much no support. Even when he was filming you could see it shake and I was holding my breath
Hey you can dig a footer around the perimeter of your cabin and put rocks in. I have seem some older cabins that the owners have done that.
Great video! Thanks for sharing! :-)
Where in Canada?
y do they need debarking? y isnt overhang included n10x10?
Great job, sir. Very creative. For those posting the negative comments, they are generally from people that have never done this in a the same environment. I admire you skills and determination. Thanks for sharing your experiences and ideas.
What province is this, yukon?
Just shit in the woods?
Thats awesome. I love it.
Have you ever found anyone to have used your cabin in an emergency? Like a person who got lost and stumbled upon it?
well done! God bless you all sir!
No scribing? looks like a hasty construction.
Nice...are there lots of mosquitoes?
very great !!
Super job, and you are absolutely correct - simplicity is freedom. I'm envious!
Nice retreat.  Thank  you.
just play minecraft lol xD
Charles for President
Good Stuff keep it up. You will save lives someday not even knowing it.
Beautiful
:) nice cabin. Gret video and funny crow story :) They are sharp birds.
Cool cabin. Horrible video editing. The awkward silences are so distracting. I'm definitely a fan of the cabin though.
Great Job! Yes Simple is Better!!
It almost sounds like you're not reading. :D
Gotta bring your 30-30 out in that bush, and keep a lookout for grizz.
AW CHARLES
tiny houses
you tube
great video man..,how long did it take to build the cabin?
nice cabin!  love it
you going to live there?
G'day I think you did a good job of the little cabin, especially in temperatures that I have never experienced here in Tasmania and it gets cold here. It is a beautiful place well done mate regards John Tasmania Australia
I love it man !! looks amazing
very nice DIY-perfect getaway
I feel a hint of Dick Prenicke in the narration lol
What a story, I feel quite sad! I love this Log cabin, and I would love to stay in one, it's so cosy! You must be so proud of the work that your hands have produced. Your brother through Christ Jesus.
Amazing
Good job I love your cabin I will like to have a cabin some day soon ... Peace
Its beautiful Man good for you. Eat the snow and herbs that are wild your all set till spring or so.
Charles!!! best story ever \o/ :3
amazing! you did an excellent job building the cabin :)
Really a great video. You're an inspiration to me and others. Keep up the great work and GOD Bless...
"Simple offers freedom"  <- yes
What insulation you used in between the logs? Moss or industrial insulation? Does the cabin stands just on the ground or you put some board on it? The floor is made of what?
I lost my shit at "did I mention it used to be a coffee table?". I love your cabin, and I hope to own a piece of land that I can live off one day.
I'd hotbox the shit out of that. Bear or no bear.
the only place in the usa where there is no zoning laws that I know of is in the City of Houston, Tx.   there maybe others , but I would check it out first, before someone comes aknockin on ur door !
very nice....please get a steel door...the bear breaking in will find you as the food.....
Nice interesting story, obviously narated by a good fellow, Well done, and hope the lads get a lot of fun out of it.
I like that and agree.  Simplicity is freedom.
What a terrific place.  Good job!
Very nice!!  A wonderful project...and how very nice to donate to the church Youth Group!!
I was under the impression that the cabin was in the middle of nowhere. I changed my mind when I saw you arriving in jeans.
-20 -no hat?
Crows are Higly intelligent animals, There is a good chance he recognized you since crows are very good at pattern recognition.
Ha, just loved this.
I sure remember when I built my rough lumber cabin in Santa Rita NM,, No permit back in early 80s .. everything was antique inside ,, even Ice box.. 1920 block ice.
Simple offers freedom :)
be blessed!
Crows are in fact among the smartest birds, and research has shown that they are not only able to recognize humans, but also to remember our attitudes towards them. I don't know how good their memory is, after all a year is a lot of time, but it is not unreasonable to believe that Charles recognized you.
I absolutely love the simplicity of the cabin and also the location.. awesome job.
Should last a lifetime(depending on your lifestyle).
I love your cabin.  Some questions sprang to mind while watching:(1)  Why not hang a bird-feeder for your friend Charles to help him through the unusually harsh spring?  (2)  Why not rent out your log cabin for weekends to raise some funds for your church?  It would make an ideal retreat house for people needing to escape from the world for a few days or a week?  I think men especially would love a week in this.  (3)  How far must you walk through the woods to get to the cabin and are you not afraid of bears while getting there?  Congratulations of a wonderful achievement and greetings from Ireland.
Crows are actually pretty smart
Good for you, good video.
This looks like a nice cabin.  FYI a rubberized trucking tarp would be very durable and easy to patch. They can be custom sized, found used and patched. They hold up to the wind very well and outlast the poly tarps by years.
nice work
Little windmill or solar panel and you're set! :D
Wonderful little cabin!!!  Perfect!!
Commend you on your project to completion.
Dick panicky
if u r sincere i apollogise
if u r sincere i apollogise
Really good man! Blessings brother in Jesus!
No wifi...
Crows are very smart birds, he probably did recognize you.
are all you off the gridders religious .what a disaster unsubscribing
nice tiny house !
Change the door from boards only to board and batten: nail battens over the gaps. Better insulation, and stronger as well.
Yes I would
This is absolutely amazing and beautiful I hope I can gave something like that one day.. You inspire me
Great Video and great job on Cabin! Thanks for sharing.
Are you Seventh Day Adventist? @outsidefun1
Nice cabin. And some people just like to complain/criticize, especially common on youtube.
You can just built there without owning the land? 0.o
Based on the stats if you monetized this video you made more from the video than you spent on this cabin lol
how do u deal with Toilet duties and items?  Do u dig a deep hole in the ground in several spots and then do ur duty into them?
really lovely history of cabin in the deep forest  much pride watching this video  congratulations well done  obs* never see snow in my life I from deep south of America
I'd die and go to heaven if I could live solo in a cabin in the woods.
Donating it to a church pfft, ur an idiot
Suddenly I like listen to Pearl jam. +1like
Wish you nothing but success in everything you build. xx
That place looks so pretty
Just one thing about the logs is if you don't peel the bark of logs it is an invitation to boring insects especially carpenter ants. The logs will eventually become punky. I find it is not so much rot that is the issue it is the friggin insects.
I appreciate your hard work, but the cabin will not more than 5 yrs, if that. But for $500, who cares, have fun it, but please make sure always keep a loaded weapon in the cabin; simply for your own protection and others! Be Safe!
-20-40 deg and No Hat. Its not possible without a bout of frostbite.  Is your Head and Ears Immune to the col?
what part of Canada northern bc?
12:15 Robert De Niro on the right side.
You sir ROCK!
So when it's 40 below it must be, what, a whole 40-50 degrees warmer in the cabin? :-p
that charles story is so good !
I personally would have to seal the cracks with something, like camper shell foam tape. otherwise I love the idea of it. it'd be great if I had a lot of land. I'd build that and then drive my 4x4 up to it and spend the weekend in it.
Great Job...heard some vehicles, how far off the road?
Awesome!👍👍👍
Where is this?
some really cool stuff you said about how simplicity entails freedom, I totally agree.
What's the name of the song?
Absolutely wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.
This is awesome..great job
This is how I really want to be able to live someday!
i've been thinking of moving back up north, how does that all work with only $500? where can you build without needing a permit? and do you have to pay for the land it's built on? also, where is this land at? and how much-if you have to pay for the land-does it cost? also are you allowed to have more then just one 10x10 place in the same area?
I like it . good.
I pray to stay in one of these precious dwellings for at least a week before I die.Its so simple all my life I've dreamt of living simple like this. You  could rent it to people and make money for your youth group. God Bless You it's really beautiful to see .
big deal. you have a fort in the woods that no one else would want to visit for any significant length of time. bravo.
good for y'all as long as y'all not fucking those lil boys
Fantastic. Screw the naysayers. There will always be complainers.
location looks so serene. i didn't notice a rifle on your shoulder or a handgun on your hip and you had a lynx stalking  you? what about other wildlife? are you just going to yell at them and hope they don't have you for dinner? bearproof your doors and windows. they may not find much but they damn sure will tear it up and piss and shit all over
"Simple offers freedom." Wise words to live by.
Pit it up on airbnb :p
Cool man . Nice work on the cabin . Reminds me of that awsome documentary *alone in the wilderness *
ya know what I think know it awesome brother,and the fact some people may have picked up a few skills for later on in life is very cool,Bless you
nice l like it.
Church pastor = fantasy merchant.
Coton can absorb 7 times its weight in water. What are you doing wearing jeans in knee deep snow?
You look like my cousin.
Well done. I appreciate your sense of mission and spirit.
Thumbs up !!
if you know you didnt mention that the door was a coffee table before you turned it into a door, why don't you just say it used to be a coffee table and spare us having to listen to the "did I mention" part
lovely jobbly. Best part donating it back to the church which will encourgae kids to coem out and hopefully get into doing similar things.
Gayest thing ever
Beautifully simple. Simply beautiful
you should push rope between the door slits like they do with old wooden boats
This guy is beast how does he make it I would quit in like 3 mins
God bless you man! keep the fire of God burning in the youth. We need it now more than ever. And awesome to see simplicity. It's beautiful
What a wonderful thing you did. Congrats!
What province are you in?
Simple offers freedom
Really awesome.
Its amazing that your roof lasted as long as it has with cold extremes like you have, where did you get it? What did you use to nail or fasten it on?
I like Charles
no clue to who is  the back ground artist that starts at  11:17 , But loved it and wish you  had listed it in the description . Great video , loved the beauty that was all around your cabin . God paints a better picture than we can ever dream of and it's ours for free to look at live in and enjoy . To you a great job on building the cabin . I live in a small home i built myself . it's not as small as yours and its not a log home but its only 14 by 32 . compare to the homes around me , mine is smaller than most peoples storage shed . I added a screened in porch , built my own porch swing and have slept in the swing a couple times . I know compare to what you have built in this video my home seems large , but my utilities are very cheap and i am looking into changing over to solar soon . I must say when people ask me what is my favorite part of the build . I say that God blessed me to be free and have the skill to build a tiny home mortgage free . It's not a cabin in the woods , but not a huge mansion either . It's home to me and has everything i need . Thanks for the video and again great music in the background .
Who owns the property?   Being able to freely cut trees for those free logs certainly helps the budget, right?   You kind of left that out.    $30ish per log, you have roughly $1,500 worth of logs there I would guess.   Making that a $2,000 cabin.     Still reasonable, but also still 4x your claim.
whats the song??
Nice job!
Your cabin, Pasto,r is very nice .I pray Our Lord will bless me with a tiny home of my, a dream home,  own. That was nice you built it and gave it to your youth group.Praise God
Does anyone else feel bad that he abandoned the crow
i wish they didn't have the manpower to do any inspections, even the tax assessor.  You own x amount of land, you owe x amount of tax...simple division....cost of government divided by number of acres in jurisdiction.  no valuation.  no inspectors.  no building permits.  no tax increase/penalty for improving.
Hi there I am jp from Miami Florida this story was a nice and very heart felt  I dream of having a cabin in tennesse that is my prayer to God I love nature and love animals I hope my prayers are heard and I can move to Tennessee when I retired thanks for your warm cabin story and nice video God bless jp....
Awesome! Great Job!
crows protect you from harm
You sir, are a very lucky man. Building your own cabin alone, by hand, very few, if any of us on here, can say that today. Great work and God bless!
how cool is that place!
Itle do piglet, itle do.
Nice...God bless! :-)
I like witchcraft
That's a job that would be fun if you had help  but cool   Be fun to get a girl up and smoke pot   N chill out. Put hay  around it. Get a C 02 detector
What province is this in?
Simplicity is always the best to approach things. Enjoyed your Video.
Good job....nice price
So you are a christian! Peace of the Lord be with you brother. The Lord guard you and keep you till the day of redemption.
Yes, there WILL always be some who find fault... but you did it man! And It looks good.
During the 1980s I built a 16 feet wide by 30 feet long log cabin with a sleeping loft.    I peeled the logs which makes for a nicer looking home.   It took me only five months to finish the cabin after waiting one year for the logs to dry after cutting them.     My log cabin looks more like a showcase home compared to the small cabin this man built.     It was warm in the winter and cool in the summer due to the natural insulating properties of logs.     My cabin had electricity and running water even though it was built in a remote area at the extreme end of the power lines.  Nearest neighbor was 1/4 mile away.    The cost to build my cabin was around $1,000 dollars as I owned the land the logs were cut on.    My only real expense was the lumber in the roof and floor which I  hired a man to saw into boards from a few big pine trees on the property.   Keep in mind this was in the mid 1980s when things were a lot less costly than they are today.    I brought up a family in that cabin and it was the happiest time of my life.     I planted huge gardens and the wife canned everything for the winter.   We raised two or three hogs every year and done a lot of fishing to round out our diet.    I would gladly live those days over in a heart beat if I could turn back the pages of time.     Never give up your dreams people, they do come true and I am living proof of that.   You will be surprised what a dream and a lot of hard work can do.
Nice music.What is it ?
Well done sir!  May God Bless you.
real nice cabin, inspired me to build. thanks
I wanna visit one day
that is awesome. should have been a little rebellious and made it 20x20 ft instead. but damn its cool
What province is this? Thank you.
Where is this ?
We have around 200hectares of ex forestry in the middle of nowhere in Scotland and I don't need permits or all the money the comment below suggested.  Last winter during storms we lost thousands of sitka spruce (we are gradually replanting with indigenous broadleaved trees) so I am building a cabin, we have a JCB which my sister had to buy to haul the felled trees off the road and since then we have got a sawmill (we already had the chainsaws for her wood burning stove) and a cement mixer. Two horses (which may or may not decide to help haul logs (spoilt brats! But part of the family! ) so even in Britain where you cant buy a big garden shed for less than around six grand (GB pounds) I think I will be able to pull off the log cabin (slightly larger than this one) for not much more than fuel for the generator and chainsaws, feed for the horses (oh fuel for JCB for leveling ground for foundation. ) the rest of the expenses will involve the solar/wind hybrid sytem a wood burning stove with hotplates,  oven and back boiler (all of which I have looked up on EBAY and wont cost more than £500 all told including a voltage controller 2x12 v deep cycle batteries and an inverter. I think cynical people who refuse to believe that 'where there's a will, there's a way' are destined to remain as slaves to mortgages and utility bills,  while people who are willing to take a risk and think outside the box are the truly free and lucky ones). BTW I love your log cabin (mine is only going to be marginally bigger to accommodate the shower/composting toilet and a sleeping loft at each end for my son to use as well as my one. Oh and yes I believe the snow at the end of April. ..I'm Scottish and have seen snow and giant hailstones in June!
Well done. Too bad you gave it to a church.
Interesting, many of us dream about getting away from it all and living simply in a cabin surrounded by mother nature. Good video!
I swear, I might just buy a piece of land and build one of these and live in it until I'm 23 (3 years) and invest and save all the money I make while I work. It sure would be an experience..
Wish millions more had this young man's attitude. When the 'money dies', most are going to be done for. If I were 50 years younger ...   :]
love it, nice job
This is a really neat cabin I really like it man. Don't listen to the dumbass haters it's a neat little hunting or just a big out chill cabin
That's more than 10x10.
Just for the future: You can flame the ends of your logs black. A thin coal layer protects against fungus and insects. For better isolation you can mix mud with hay and simply smear it in the gaps. It will dry and preserve the wood.
That's amazing brother! I live south of Denver Colorado and I would love to build a cabin like that!
a single crow calling while perched high in a tree means that they're signaling their flock of danger. that must mean you're the danger, i assume, and  if your 'charles' didn't call of your danger to the others....well, sad to say, then the flock would fly in and kill your 'charles'. that's just what crows do. crows just act like the 'mafia' in the bird world. i'd say 'charles' was a good, loyal bird for his flock
great job, its awesome
Great purpose and what a fun structure to build. Is expand and advance a delegatory possibility?
Charles is letting the bears know where you are to be honest, that's what they do, but nice cabin!
very nice.need more like u for the youth.
So epic... I've lived in the city most of my life, but I am really drawn to stuff like this... pretty sweet.
Great fun, nice to have a place like that cabin.
Crows are incredibly intelligent and he most definitely recognized you.  Lots of interesting studies have been done on them.
Should've brought some food for the lynx
Beautiful man. God bless you brother. :)
Great video and cabin brother, Canada needs more real men like you! I'm sure the youth group loved helping you and great experience as well.
That is a very nice cabin
use Dr. Shrink for your roof! It is perfect!
They will rot, give it time.
Wife and I are talking about getting some land so we can build a cabin on it. We both want to make it as simple as possible. I think you hit the nail on the head!! It looks cozy and nice size, though I think we will go a little bigger but never the less good work!
Very nice !
where abouts is this? I live in prince george and would love to do this
I think it's pretty cool you know I enjoyed your story thanks.   I know from experience if you had to go live there you would be building all kind a little inventions and you would find out you could survive and actually be pretty happy just with God in your life. I know I am, And I wish the whole world could be
You sound like Ron Swanson.
It's perfect
A nice cozy cabin!
What country?
Thank you for posting this wonderful video!  My husband and I live in rural Washington State and love doing these projects in our spare time.  And what a wonderful experience for your youth group!  There's just something about living in the woods, growing your own food and building your own shelters that brings us each closer to our spirituality.  I hope that your youth group learned from this experience and has since gone on to share what they've learned with others.  May God continue to bless you in all of your future endeavors!
So nice :)  Thanx for sharing your video.
What an awesome video.  Makes me want to build one myself.
Wow Great! I want to move to Canada and live in a cabin in the woods.
looks more like -2  don't exaggerate
simple offer freedom
I love your video. The cabin is beautiful.
I think it's perfect.  Thanks for letting us see.
Nice. Your a good storyteller. I like how you talked about the Crow.
Very useful thank you!
What is the tune at the end of the video.  I am digging it. if anyone knows please let me know.  great video and even a better meaning/purpose behind the cabin.   beautifully done.
too bad I wouldn't be able to build one of these in the US.
great job. but please don't wear jeans in the snow LOL not very smart
hey great video! just one question though, what is the song at the end of the vid? it sounds so familiar but I cant figure it out!
hey great video! just one question though, what is the song at the end of the vid? it sounds so familiar but I cant figure it out!
hey great video! just one question though, what is the song at the end of the vid? it sounds so familiar but I cant figure it out!
people used to raise up to a dozen kids in houses just this size.  Now we have bigger houses and fewer children!  Great vid.
Awesome! God bless you!
I'm ready to live off the grid!:
that's awesome, I like how you were able to do it without and building permits and how you made simple spell freedom that's so true. God is good!
I keep thinking of the very first day that Charles came and you weren't there!  But I always worry myself to bits over stuff like that with animals that you can't actually explain things like that to them.  But I wish always that I could.
Wish we could do this in NB I don't think we can, Irving would come and say we have to take it down because the wood wasn't bought from them....
Could someone tell me the song, artist, and album being played at the end of the video?
If he is worried about the bottom logs rotting, why can he not just pour quick crete around them, and every yr or so repaint the quick creted area with a sealant to keep the water out?
at 9:48 that's a great shot the snow flakes look golden
its awesome
What a great job and I loved your video.  Simple is better!  What is the title/artist of the song at the end of the video?
What an amazing and fun project to share with your youth group. Simple, well thought out, another great idea from God and his creation.💡
NICE...!!! NICE...!!
well done , always wanted to build a cabin like this .
Instead of criticism all I will say is you did a good job, looks like a nice place to visit. Think I'd like to try doing something similar. How's the hunting and fishing around there?
we're is this at
That's a gorgeous door!
I love the brid that is really amazing
Does anyone know if i wanted to build one of these small ones in Arizona is it legal?
To live here, you must have a good rifle or gun and lots of ammo with it I guess????????????????
great job Brew..
Thanks OutsideFun1 for posting this great project. Sorry that so many people attacked you for the comment on being a youth pastor, but keep the faith Brother. And I hope you get to enjoy the cabin and the memories of building it.
AWESOME
It's a beautiful cabin! Praise Him from whom all blessings flow.... Love & Light to you and yours!
How did you keep from getting lost?
Very awesome my friend, God bless you :-)
Nice job, take care
Love to see young folks doing this.  I've been a builder for over fifty years and just have a couple comments.   I hope they are taken as constructive.  First thing that caught my eye was the treated 6x6 s used for gussets on the loft.  I am sure these are just temporary as I nice porch with columns on the corners made of the same logs are in your future plans.   And then having built my own log structure for a shop many years ago and having made a few mistakes the glaring problem I see is the notching.   The way this was done is what is called the Lincoln Log way.   Like the ones we use to play with.   The problem with this is they are water catchers.   Water will catch on the upward facing notch and will seep in between the notches and sit there rotting out the corners prematurely.   There are two ways to avoid sitting water in there when building.   One is the dove tail notch and the other is the fitted Swedish notch.   Only the bottom of the upper log is notched doing it the Swedish way.  Regardless I still love the idea, the work involved and especially the location.   Nothing better then the silence of the woods and a star filled night.
where exactly did you find out the laws for the land and such before you started building???
Ahh, now that's my kind of video. Nice job. Solitude and nature, or experienced with others. Great way to get to know the world around you. Thanks for the video.
Nice job and great idea.
inside?????
This is a really nice cabin.  I am a trapper of which I am looking for ideas for small log cabins as a in between or just in case mid point cabins from the main one.  Very, nicely done.
If this is your 1st? I would give it a A++.
ice damn roofing tar paper is good for roofing cover .
Sure it's simple.... Simply getto as fuck
Keyword here is PRIVATELY OWNED LAND. try going and building this anywhere else and you will come back a year later to it being burnt to the ground.
Very nice, I would like to build something like your cabin. I am sure Charles knew it was you.
Would Lynx attack an adult?
Some time ago I saw the video where you built this cabin. Seeing it now is really nice.
Wow. Your voice. And those long quiet shots. So calm. :)
why do people wear cotton pants in the snow? that s*** is just so retarded. put some damn wool on
It's a cool little cabin
"simple offers freedom" ...well put.
Good Job!!! yep no permit required when getting a permit if you can't afford a bigger home just ask what is the permitted dimensions to build a cabin... ;)
bad ass
"simple offers freedom" subbed! =)
Very well done - what is the song in the background...
next project an outhouse haha
Wow this is awesome nice to see young ppl doing such positive things I wish I could do something like this as well keep up the good work
The cabin height seems higher than 10ft
Sure looks larger than 10x10 allowed size. What am I missing as to size and the front overhead on 2nd floor ? Looks like a really cozy and fun project... BEST LUCK FOR A HOMEIE HOME :)
Cheers! Great Job. Some people want huge houses in big cities , folks like us want tiny houses far far away from those type of people.  i live in ketchikan, alaska. I would like to duplicate your efforts and would love to speak with you about the efforts leading up to your initial build. Thanks!!
Thinks it's great..
Really enjoyed the video and your time and effort in sharing !
This is incorrect.  In almost all jurisdictions in the United states, if you build any permanent structure you intend to live in, you need a permit.  In many states sheds and small storage building under 200 sf (some allow up to 400 sf) do not need permits.  But that is for unheated simple storage sheds.  If you are going to occupy it and live in, it needs a permit for health and safety reasons.  making it small does not relieve you from having to get a permit or complying with building codes, you will be fined if you are caught in most jurisdictions.  Alaska may be the only exception.
Can you go a little more in depth on the legalities of this subject? I've looked into building a cabin myself using resources from the land and living a secluded lifestyle, but seem to run into minor legal issues with each idea. Where in Alaska is this, what are the property taxes (if any), what are the typical building codes (if you were to build a cabin that exceeds the 10'x10' ft cabin you have) and where could one find more information on this for independent research? Thanks for the video and time. Very inspiring stuff!
Wouldn't a  yurt or dome be easier? Round, more space!
Why would a church need a cabin in the middle of the forest for it's youth group?
Great video! Great project!!! Thanks for sharing and God bless you
This is awesome!! This little Cabin is probably hella fun! Great Vid!
Of course Charles recognized you. Crows have some of the best face recognition abilities in the animal kingdom. As well as long long memories. They are also thieves at heart so try not to turn your back for too long on him. Be careful with any open flame as well because they love fire and are known for starting bush fires and burning down barns and homes.  And awesome cabin.
why the hell would anyone want to live in such a climate?
No hat in minus 20 degrees? Cool little cabin though. By the way , I recognize that crow and its name is Carla, Charlie moved to Florida to get out of the cold.
My best regards to Charles when you meet him again...
Fantastic Job OutsideFun ! You forgot to mention the HUGE amount of Self Satisfaction you must have gained from this project !  Very well done !
I love it man! Great video.
Nice keep the faith
Great job with the cabin. Liked the video, narration a little too sing-songy imo, but would watch again.
now how do you connect it to pipes and to the grid?
Where's your hat?  don't feed the kittty!   Wheres the stove burrrrrr!
" Simple offers freedom. " I like that.
Cool video. Nice cabin too!   I've been considering building some sorta simple 'cabin' myself...but rather than logs like yours, doing it as I guess what you'd call "traditional construction" (ie: using standard lumber).  For for legal purposes it could simply be called "a shed" (as no building permit is required in the area where it'd be in for sheds under a certain size(I don't remember the numbers right now))  Construction really wouldn't be that hard...Only part I really wouldn't know how to do would be a wood-burning stove for heat.
It is a bad idea to make a blanket statement like "no permit needed" since codes vary by state and county.  Where I live, if you build it and it is either 72" above grade, or is more than 50 square feet or is more than 12 feet long on it's longest side it needs a permit.  If you build it without a permit, then when code enforcement does it's annual inspection of your property and discover it, you will get a court order in the mail telling you to remove the structure at your expense and to have it done within ten days.  The maximum dimensions for non permitted structures varies greatly throughout the country.  Where I lived before, I built an 8' x 12' by 7 foot tall green house and had to tear it down even though it was not attached to the ground.  Also in my state, if you decide to put the item on wheels, if it weighs over half a ton it requires a trailer registration, must have a way to hook it up to a vehicle and must have tax stickers and external lights.
Nice Video.
Excellent video, I love the place :)
I'm so happy this came up on my video feed, thanks for posting!
I like your cabin man. looks good. I hope to find the energy to build one by the end of next summer. It will be a bit different though.
Hope you build one for people who needs sturdy homes specially in our country who has always been hit with super typhoons . The Phillipines
Amazing love you shown.  Sharing it is wonderfully outstanding.  I hope you build more of this nice log cabin.
"Simple offers freedom"
As a homesteader I found your video quite good. Quite entertaining. Quite instructive.  Thanks for posting. By the way, which snow shoes do you think are best?
i like your story about Charles, its nice that you made a freind.
I think I could have done better, then again I would have to try first.  It would also have taken me longer.  I think the design looks safe and that it will last a long time.  I am surprised the tarp lasts that long.  I wouldn't expect it to last longer than 2 season's.    What did you live in while building it?  A Quincy?, I could not imagine living in a tent in those conditions.
I like it...Nice
I noticed some cracks in your door. Must be more careful as you are loosing heat and contributing to global warming since you need to burn more wood....obviously I'm kidding. Nice job.
where is your woodstove for warmth???
simple does offer freedom...I agree...I live off grid too
you are an amazing person   and that is an amazing cabin for the price
fantastic video it was like a lovely novel
1:58 ! Lynx ? Looks like Wolf tracks .
The cool thing about this project is that it seems very easy to build upon later if people want to improve it.  If someone really wanted to put a roof on there instead of just the tarp, the framework is already there for it. If someone wanted to do a nicer front "porch" area, it'd be easy to run some 4x4s down from the over hand, make a floor, etc.  This came out really nice, especially for under $500.
how did you get the Furniture there? did you carry it? if so, how far away is the cabin from a road?
Nice cabin but you don't respect your eyes. Safety glasses duh.
its fine, but it would be good to put some posts straight down under the front 2 corners and build a small poarch under there too, it wouldnt take many trees, but it would look really good. beautiful countryside, thanks for sharing :)
I definitely give it more up than down but I have a good deal of experience with using tarps to seal off rooves. They rarely last more than two years. In most cases, I have had to replace them annually. If this is the roofing you want, get the heavy tarps that  flatbed trucks use to cover their cargoes. Those are far more likely the last the 5-10 years you're talking about and they will be far better in heavy winds than what I am seeing on your cabin here (that last statement is contingent on me seeing it well on my small netbook screen).
crows can remember faces
1:10 Global warming ya know.
I think it was a great video and the fact you took time out of your day to build something that helped other's build themselves up is commendable. People are going always have something negative to say about other's dedication, sacrifice and hard work. those people who down play this only envy your self sacrifice. Thanks for sharing
Totally on board until you started blathering on about your job, indoctrinating young people into your world of invisible friends with magical powers.  This is not 2000 BC, we have different clothes, jobs, technical devices and we know about the Cosmos.  A parochial deity, who directly interfaces with you, seems incredibly unlikely.
it's kind of a cool thought living in the wild you against nature. but also a Scary thought of droping a log on you leg and not being able to walk and freezing to death.
If this was in the U.S. the communist Obummer administration would be out there with a tape measure . . . 10'x10' . . . oh really?
Great cabin, love it
A very nice looking log cabin that you built Log cabins are my fave..
Great work and I must say I am jealous for the best quality of life anyone can ask for. Great bug out spot to boot.
ok so you build a cabin then leave only so you can come back 4 years later WTF is wrong with that wasting resources ..Seems to be what all humans do nowadays..
Love it, awesome!
1 word for ya. AWESOME!
P.lants
Good job great project for the youth group, God Bless.
just wondering which is better. outside looking in or inside looking out?
I personally love what you did there and I love your personality and opinion on everything that you did there and I have a couple family trade secrets that if you want  you me and maybe my son  can go up and do a natural foundation on your cabin and it'll stay there for quite a few hundreds of years. we can just use the natural materials there
very nice video.  Good going.
Very nice. Looks like a good spot to spend a peaceful weekend.
looks fantastic....!!! nice job
Very "Dick Proenneke".  Nicely done.
So so amazing man.   It's easy for the weak to make critical comments, that being said, its light years more difficult to put in the time, effort, expertise and hours upon hours of burning muscles to complete this admirable feat.  Plus, its something that you will hold high not just in the public eye, but in your retrospective eye for the rest of your life.  Enjoy that reward, and congratulations on your completion , and thank you for the following quote that I, along with others I'm sure, will take with me.  "There will always be people who find fault in a simple design, but all I know, is that it works for me."  That just might be one of the secrets to life.  Great job.
This video is Canadian as fuck.
Did You say snow in April??? Wow ! Where or what state are you in? I love the snow!!!  By the way Great Cabin! ;-)   Hoping to hear from you soon for the location..
Its amazing sir !! I am busy with a project to make people more aware of life. Can you build one for me ? Not really for me alone but I want to share it with people, So they will learn how to respect and understand, nature and life. Thanku for this amazing video.
Hey I would really like you to reply to this. I live in Australia and breed reptiles. When I am 16 I hope to build a cabin like this. I know you probably don't know much in this field but do you think that this cabin is trustworthy enough to house reptiles in tanks. What I mean by this is, does it have any chance of falling down or endangering the reptiles inside it. The reptiles will be in tanks and the temperature will not be a problem as I live in Australia  Thanks, Cameron
Soon even the idiots will no longer believe in Global Warming...
Great tiny cabin in the woods. Looks like it survived the 4 seasons.
it looks amazing, don't let other peoples opinions change your mind
You are what is good about the world. Simple and functional
"...simple offers freedom..." thank you for my message from GOD. :)
Late April?!?!
charles the crow is among the most intelligent of bird species . crows can live for years and most likely remembered   you . crows can distinguish friends from foes .   you can learn more about them from the pbs documentary " a murder of crows " .  crows and ravens are my totem !
Can't find any fault in this, and I'm an anal retentive general contractor, who picks apart everything. Awesome cabin. Wished I could do this.
wow! very cool bud!!! wished I could have helped you!
I love that little cabin and Charles too!  great job!
That's pretty awesome!
This is Impossible with today's Nanny State that  everyone keeps Voting for....
cool...   but, one helper would make it go 4 times faster..  I do this for a living..  2 helpers is even better
What a nice cabin! It looks like a wonderful retreat and I imagine its planning and building were a refreshing return to the basics of life. I enjoyed the finished video as well. Your filming and editing skills are quite good. Is there a story behind the broken axe hanging on the outside wall?
cool video
what a neat project..........it could be a yearly summer camp project and you could build a community of small cabins. for the church.
Very Cool, Bro love the cabin
Great cabin. I can only dream of such things !
All that work. It seems a shame not to build a proper foundation that would help preserve it.
nice cabin nice country nice story
Hell you did a great job,
You sir... deserve many likes, great to hear such good happening in the world :).
That might have been Carl Jr. LOL
With increasingly warming weather, those poor cats should have a little easier time of it in winter. In the LONG RUN that is.
You build what you can with what you have and that's just fine! I think it's a fine cabin! A man could ask no more than to shelter from the elements in such a fine cabin.
\m/ amazing bro !!!!
Great job!! Something to be proud of!!!
It's AWESOME :-) I know a guy called Charles Raven
awesome
Awesome build..but jus for future reference for those that plan to do this..de-bark the logs first! They will not last long if you dont..wood eating beetles..moisture will get in the bark and rot the logs
You're hot, and I totally want my own small house in the woods. Thanks for this.
That is soooooo cool
I'm city boy/ like near by and I like a log home to be at best 20x20 ... glad for you but cold weather isn't for me..
Very nice!
Late April? Damn, global warming is real.
wot a lovely vid very nice.
"Great little" place to be !!!  Subbed :-)
I live in NYC, Id love to have a little getaway like this but Id have to have firepower on me at all times. It looks like they have bears and wolves out there. But damn, its beautiful.
OK, cool now ..... is it on YOUR land or are you squatting - is it a legal build or not !?!
Nice work!
Hi.  You are right about Charles recognizing you.  Crows are highly intelligent birds and have amazing memories.  I have no doubt that Charles recognized you.
Nice job. Most people would bring some piece of shit broken RV and live like pigs around the property.
Your little bush home is very sweet! We own a trapline in Northern BC and live there for several months of the winter and spring. It is pretty remote, but we like it that way. Just for information's sake...we rescued a very old trapper's cabin last fall, where the logs had not been peeled and it stood right on the ground. We had to replace the roof, as the old poles were done in, but the wall logs were in amazingly good shape and only needed a couple of replacements. We treated the logs to help preserve them longer and also used a heavy duty tarp as a roof. My husband will use it as a line cabin this winter. It's very tiny, but will be cozy and warm for him after a long day on the trail. Best of luck in your future log building endeavours and many blessings!
I think your cabin is nearly perfect!  It's just big enough to get in out of the weather and store just a few things to make your time out in nature perfect.  Yet it's small enough that it won't take half a lifetime to maintain.  Loved your video, everything just registered with me.  It wasn't until nearly the end, when you stated you're a youth pastor that it all came together for me.  It seems true christians just seem to enjoy much of what the Lord had to provide.  THANKS for the video; it really made my whole BETTER.
Great job mate, can't imagine what - 40 would feel like coming from Australia. The log home is great.
Whats the song sounds? thanks
You would need several building permits and more money and permits for cutting down the trees here in Trinity County, California.   If you want freedom to do what you want on your own property do not move to California.
you can also make a cordwood cabin...using firewood laid on it's side using concrete or cob...which is clay mixed with sand as a binder between the pieces of firewood...
why didn't you make the bottom half bigger...it can be 8 feet by 15 feet....or10 feet by12 feet...
He must not value his time very highly, if he considers the cost to be only $500.
I like your cabin very much. $500.00 is nothing when you compare it to the cost of housing in Southern Ontario. I pay $500.00 per month for a room.  Yes one room, and share a bathroom.   The cost of housing in North America is insane.  Half of my income is spent so I can live indoors, because the alternative is unthinkable.  I hope you find more time to enjoy your cabin.
weird animals
makes me wanna play minecraft..
what's the weather like in June?
Simplicity is always best.  God bless you.  I enjoyed your video.
Where's the fireplace to heat the cabin? It seems one would freeze to death in there.
WOW
hoah
one question . am i right in thinking that a metal roof would save the cabin from a forest fire ?
hey brother . fantastic work and video !  i can feel your heart . thanks .  mike
wow a great job i wish i had money to do this your lucky i have to many bills good luck
sweet cabin man
Wikid cabin and amazing camera great picture and good cam work keep it up man
damn, you're the ******* Man! good stuff, keep it up. i love survival and natural medicine etc. ill check you out soon.
That's awesome bro
How do you insulate the cracks between the logs?
Finally, some religious people doing the right thing and teaching the young useful stuff.
Very beautiful love it congratulations, always wanted have a friend like this that I can help just to learn how to build capinet like this ,,
god bless man great video and great build on the cabin
Very nice video.
Sweet, If I didn't live right in the city I'd build a below ground home with parking on top for the bikes scooters & skateboards.  Wonderful job & project, thanks for sharing
I once had a Raven befriend me. Part of the crow family and very intelligent. I named him Rufus. This brought back some great memories.
"Simple offers freedom"
I want one...
Do you have any ants?  We have tons of carpenter ants that have forced us to treat logs.  In a few months, they took out several logs we had found and stacked on some other logs to use later.  Sure worked fast on it.  Thoughts?
do you have any plans to send letters ranting against technology? any people to get even with? sorry, couldn't resist.
i love it! congratulation!
But, but, but... What about global warming?
Although I generally don't agree with religion or religious affiliations, I'm glad church allowed people to be exposed to this kind of thing. It's always inspiring to see people build things by hand.
Why so many thumbs down haters on this?
where's the shitter?
what a genius idea, I have always want to be an architect, and I've always wanted to build my own home but I wandered how to do it without all those crazy permits and a log cabin has never crossed my mind. that seems like a great activity to do with your youth group, I wish I could've  had the same experience when I went to church. also I think I might know Charles or some of his family, no matter where I go I see crows, which I find kinda creepy because I grew up in las vegas where it is rare to find any bird other then a pigeon, but now I live in michigan on the border of sarnia Canada so it my be possible that him or his family have flown here before.
Nice place to go off the grid.
Would like to build one with my grandkids if a few years when they are a little older. Building a barn right now and let them help a little. They think it's fun.
Like your cabin. How long did the tarp roof really last?
Crows love cookie crumbs and chocolate pieces
dude this is an awesome video. I was really thinking about subscribing to your channel but when you said that your youth pastor I was immediately like, YEA.. Im subscribing ;p
I have one quick question and it is how long did the full construction take? Because i dream that when i am older (maybe 25-30) i can build one of my own and have it as a kind of holiday home where i could bring my children at christmas. I really liked your video and good luck in making a new one :)
What a great idea to build something wonderful and share it with others!
Thank you for sharing your story on this. Very cool! I especially like that you share about Charles...very sweet :)
Do you plan on living in the cabin full time eventually?
lovely.
beautiful place to disconnect from the city and problems, and just being in contact with nature. also with the reward of the work made by yourself
Cherish the cabin!
what did you use for between the logs? insulation?
bears wont show up in the winter ,,, they are sleeping
would love to know the name of the music and author. great cabin:)
i think its cool...
Wow that global warming is really something.
Donated it to the church - Code for - the churches new pedophile camp .  *
did you just chop down nearby trees for the logs?
That cabin is fantastic, how is it heated? like is it a potbelly stove or something?
Good job! You've created a home (and a home where you can live freely).
It's soooo nice to see young people doing things in the outdoors. My hat's off to ya.
Beautiful and inspiring.  :)
I could take about a weeks vacation out there...
Why is debarking important? Curious!
Impressive. I am envious Sir.
Well done
Well done. I like the editing, music selection and the fact that your a "youth minister". My oldest is in ministry. Unfortunately, were astranged from one another at the moment. I would love to see him. Please keep us in your prayers. God bless. Jeremiah 29:11
Wonderful shelter from the elements. Well done! Old Fart approved!
how is it possible to build it and not have to deal with having permits to build on that property?unless if you own the property i guess i can see not required to have a permit...but doing this on public land i would assume a permit is needed.... i could be wrong i am from merica... a country that taxes everything you own
you are so smart, love this video
The photos at the end are super cool... Loads of good memories I guess, right? Cool video!
Beautiful cabin
wow $500 ....... ya can build 100% metal one for under $1,500  yea its $1000 more but its metal ^ <^
That bird is a raven, not a crow. :-)
Really enjoyed the vid. Thanks for the trouble.
grate job
Nice!
no way this is great wish you could help me
So you are taking credit for something god built? You obviously did fuck all but watch god build this shit.    I was praying to god that you would give this place to him because it was obvious from the first second of the video that you would burn in the christian, muslim, catholic, and hindu hells all at the same time if you did not admit gods control over you while he built this (and your lazy meat sack watched sucking his energy like a leech)   You did the right thing and gave god the credit.    What have you done to help your church here? You did fuck all. God built this cabin. Do you think your church needs more body slaves to build log coffins in the mountains? No, your god needs babies. Now go get it done! Be fruitful!
I am sure the youth group helped with the endless chinking.  For one person, that would take forever.
i could soooooo live in that cabin comfortably. just not in the snow....
love this cabin and ur resons for doing it. It is superb work because its an original! you are teaching the youth of tomorrow that ur hands really are the best gift He gives you for working with!
trenching down past the topsoil layer (roughly 1-2 ft) and laying in large rock all the way up to the surface with smaller gradeed rock as filler would also improve your footing considerably.  That said, it's a lot more labor intensive and the rock may be hard to naturally find.
how did u get the lumber and furniture back to your building location?
Really enjoyed your video follow up...I like that you don't let other people opinion of your build overcome you. I always wanted to build my own log house, On a bigger scale though and It's still in the bucket list, we will see if it ever happens. In any case thanks for sharing your video! In which province is it?
I love it!!! Thank you!!
The cabin in my opinion is cute, efficient and pretty darn awesome , flaws included. $500 building cost is pretty impressive and bringing the community together at times during the build process and donating it as soon as you finished made it priceless in the memories and values it holds.
Cool!
a baby crow fell out of a tree in my back yard and i had him as a loyal pet for 26 years... his name was herman
that door is beautiful!! The finish and color!! is kinda less than solid??
Greetings from Russia, really enjoyed your video.. Peace!
Excellent video and narration, this reminds me of Dick Proenneke's film.
Must be near PA, SK somewhere!
I have watched you're videos many times! I think they are amazing I would love to live in a place like this! I am 20 years old and it is my dream and goal in life to live somewhere like this. How much money does it require to take the first step? I own no land but I have been searching all I can find is very expensive. If you can offer any advice it would be much appreciated. Have a nice day buddy!
awesome project, i wished i lived somewhere amazing like that to build one on. Giving to the church was a good idea as long as the keep it up lol. God bless!
The story of Charles brought a tear to my eye. Its sad that you might not see each other again.
"Simple offers freedom." Indeed!😊
waisted alot of good trees by not debating and building off the ground. :(
Great video, beautiful little cabin.  Reminds me of Richard Proenneke.
great project. ..great story
Was enjoying until heard "I was a youth pasture".  As soon as someone says they believe in a magic man that lives in the sky, I cease to respect their opinions on anything...  Too bad..
beautiful! all u need to do is install a nice wood stove !
its a beautiful place and a lovely cabin.its the simple thing in life that counts more.
Great video - Nice job and a wonderful country you live in.
It's cool and it looks great !!
Im lost for words in the simple beauty of this home. Its also built in such a gorgeous setting. I seemed to have found peace while watching this video
awesome
That crow did recognize you. Crows are one of the few birds that are able to identify individual human faces. You may want to think twice about feeding him. They will rob you blind, food or any object that takes their fancy will disappear. Ravens are even more interesting. They actually do things just for fun. I have watched videos of there repeatedly sliding down a snow covered hill while they are upside down.   I digress. Great job on the cabin. I really like the overhang and loft. It actually makes the cabin livable.
nicely done...bravo
I like where you say, " I DONATED IT TO THE YOUTH GROUP" ...good for you.....and good job on a great cabin...looks sturdy.
Thank-You so much for this video.
Very true, you taught the young ones some very invaluable skills with this project. I would like to do something similar. How long did it take to find the logs and prepare them? How long did it take you to complete the project, how much help did you have? I want to get the young ones together in my group and build 4 or 5 cabins.
that's a nice big slice of freedom. good man!
as i can se you dont drink getting up the letter it would take me a week to get up there  i like the cabin first floor only thanks
So, the secret to building a $500 cabin is having access to free lumber, free land, and free child slave-labor. That's my kind of project, lol.
living the dream, frickin awesome!!!
wow very cool!!!!!
NICE JOB MAN!! Dont worry about the people trying to point out your flaws! Truth is, 95% of them probably couldn't build one on their own if they tried! Everyone who's ever built anything has learned from their experiences and know what to do, and what not to do next time. No one is perfect! NO ONE!! KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO, AND DONT WORRY ABOUT WHAT OTHERS THINK! Nice cabin.
GREAT JOB ON CABIN
The only thing I don't like about it is, its not mine. I like the cabin.
"Simple offers Freedom" - Amen!  Great Job!
Most of states you may need a permit. Oh well, I'm sure he said "Northern Canadian wilderness"...
Personally, I would LOVE to live it in, it looks like my dream cabin in my dream spot, wow, PERFECT!
It look`s great
Good job. I enjoyed your video.  I suspect that you will live an interesting life. God bless you.
Thank you, GREAT cabin !!!
Awesome
That looks like mineral insulation between the logs. Mineral insulation is _NEVER_ to be exposed as it will easily find its way to lungs. It must be sealed away. If it is mineral insulation please do not let kids stay in there until it is replaced with something that will not damage lungs or sealed away.
If you built it to donate it, I don't understand why you didn't take the time to get the logs off the dirt and peeled. Isn't it going to be someone else's problem once it starts to deteriorate?
Wonderful
Very Cool Project! & Excellent Video, thank you for sharing!
Great cabin!!  I have a small farm in Lower SE US and hunt a lot.  Do you have plans available for this 10x10.  Here we have mostly pine, oak, gum and poplar.   what do you recommend and is curing needed for  the trees to dry out?  Thanks so much, God bless you and  your family!   Gene S
Ok, So am I the only one scared by the revelation that Lynx have apparently grown human hands and have taken too stalking us in the forest? :O
Thank you for sharing; Its great to just 'go & do' (with a conscientious common sense approach) instead of just sitting back and Dreaming/Waiting for opportunities that may or may not arise! Far too often people don't even take a dump without first getting things signed in Triplicate and Blessed by the Pope. Who are these frigging 'Authorities' anyway? they're certainly not the kinda folk we elected to manage things back in the day. They are all slaves to the Profit Mad Corporations anyway. Well done. You are just as important as the CO of the logging company wanting to increase his Revenue. I have no doubt that you respect the land. p.s. I'm sure you are 'above board' (as they say) & did enough research - too many Party Poopers making comments here. I take my hat off to you Sir.
I might have missed it, are you in the US or Canada? If US, I take it your in Alaska? Thanks. Great job by the way!!!!
Thats awesome! Love it! Good experience for those kids too. Now you just need to keep further generations of those kids busy building more cabins. Get enough and you will have a camp. :)
Great cabin. You're blessed.
Awesome! Way to fuck the NWO! We need to all stop paying the banks.
its a good looking cabin! God bless
I think this cabin is awesome as it's all a few people would need. Great job please work on your next update soon! Mary
Looks like a fine little casita to escape to ....good job...thanks for sharing...
That's a beautiful little cabin!
I thought I was the only one who "caw"s back at crows!!! Ha, I guess not! Beautiful cabin...you're very skilled.
good job brother! looks like a dream home to me minus the 40-50 degree negative weather!
Wow. I really like the cabin and am super jealous. I am still a minor and my family never did this kind of thing. When I get older I would like like more like you do.
Glad to hear that you and Charles nare still friends !! ;-)
NIce little cabin, sir! I keep thinking of doing something like that here... we have a few hundred acres and a little cabin like that would make a great retreat!
why do so many people not even consider this is something they can do?
Sir, I did quite enjoy your video.  The story about the crow was a very nice touch.
Beautiful location, great camera talent and formatting and most importantly an aesthetically pleasing and rather simple cabin. Great video :)
"No permit required"  -- DEPENDING ON WHERE IT'S BUILT. Most of the US, you'll need a permit.
Is there alot of mosquitoes during the summer?
That is sweet!
Could easily raise the cabin and put it on small cinder blocks in the future, next project maybe?
Sorry if it was part of the Video but i have to ask: Is this Canada?
Beautifull vid. Thank you for sharing... you are a hard working man. But gosh dragging all those darn heavy logs. Be carefull not to hurt your back doing all that work by hand... Good luck, you build a nice one!
Thanks for sharing!
That is a beautiful home my friend, well done! As a Northman at heart myself, I hope to eventually settle down and make a cabin for myself and family. Thank you for the tips and advice your videos have offered. : )
Contact me I have questions......
why would a permit even be required i mean who the heck cares its in middle-of-nowheresville somewhere in the northern Canadian wilderness why would any of the government folks even care?
GET A JOB,like the rest of us......
OutsideFun1  Cool video, and even cooler cabin. Definitely earned a sub. I've always wanted to build and live in a simple cabin, at least for some time. Enjoy nature and what it has to offer. But being 19, having no job (at least for now, actively searching!) and living in the valley of California, I'm not sure where I'd even begin to start on such a project, what experience or tools I'll even need. Any guidance you can offer on such a thing would be very much appreciated.  Again, well done on the video and cabin. :)
You know nothing John Snow !
Awesome. What a great job.
I enjoyed Watching your video great job!
Beautiful
"Simple offers freedom"... love it !! :D   +1 subscriber.
This is simple and beautiful. Thanks for sharing, and excellent job.
awesome dude
Now thats old school building. Looks good and great work.
I love the cabin. Wish I had one.
Cool :)
What state is that in and is it warm in winter
Perfect! Great video, thank you!
superb ! warts and all :)
Neet cabin....
Makes video about self-made log cabin, wears skinny jeans through powdered snow with no hat on an alleged -4 degree day. Tell the truth or dress up young man!
What did you use for caulk?...Just the store bought stuff and how did you waterproof the roof?
I do believe that Charles did in fact recognize you http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/science/26crow.html?_r=0
simple offers freedom   yes indeed.  I love everything about this vid! congrats and thanks
Awesome video, you definitely have your act together and your priorities in order!  I wish you all the best!!
nice job, but those gigantic boards on the front facing upper floor must have been expensive.
Do you have time to build me one?
Good job!
Rot... the bane of the remote log cabin.  One can build a great little cabin, but it's destined to return to the soil from whence it came.  Without maintenance, the same is true of any all wood house.
I must see Canada one day my dad split up with my mother for six years went to Canada became a citzen working the Hudsons bay and St Lawrence Seaway area. When the got back together again my mother didn't want tp go to Canada so I always wondered about the life that may have been.
~~~~~~love this cabin & love the area....so peaceful and closer to GOD.....I love alaska in FEB as well....its magical.....I bet your cabin is even better in summer w/all the wildlife.....your spirit is wonderful.....building something so special and sharing with others....a true free spirit!!! Bless you!!!
You are a talented craftsman! Great job and in a beautiful location!
wow...this would be my dream home.
love the crow story! :)
Loved this. (Now I'm a new subscriber.) "Simplicity, simplicity. I say let your affairs be as two or three. . ." I'll call that a paraphrase since I quoted it from memory (Henry David Thoreau). By the way, my son is a youth pastor--or was, till they couldn't afford him. Now he works in the meat department. These days life is so full of stress. I'm glad I'm retired but I need to leave California and go back to Alaska. (There is more water in Ketchikan.)
Congratulation man ,you did very good job , yours cabin it's just perfect i love it. All people who like outdoor activity its dream about .I wish to have one like yours too , but land its very expensive where i live {British Columbia } if i find little chipper its way to far, maybe one day ? I wish for you to enjoy lots of good time with yours wife & friends in this beautiful cabin.
I can't help but be reminded of the old educational videos we used to watch in school as a kid. The narration is so similar. I hate to say monotone, and in most cases it would be boring, but there's just something about this video that makes me smile. Good luck to you in your life ventures.
what an inspiration. Good for you. This is a fantastic video. Where in Canada is this. I'm in a little town called Harrow Ontario (almost as south as you can be in Canada.)
Love it.
Dig that little cabin! Beautiful and peaceful setting, too. Nice work.
Nice cabin! I like how you coexist with nature instead of trying to alienate yourself from it, which I see all too often with modern cabin dwellers.
Crowmance. You said hello every day then suddenly you're gone, he must have been shattered and comes back every day for you. I might cry, seriously.
I'm worried about your spine
Love the cabin...great simple design...! Im wondering since you said you werent there for over three seasons why? Have you ever thought about leaving it all and just living off the grid here??
great job!
K.I.S.S. KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID. GEEAT JOB.
Sweet
everybody wants to sound like Richard Proenneke, i like the video
What an inspiration  to see what simplicity  can offer,to mean as you said its freedom! and very well done video . Greetings  from Germany!
Shoutout to Charles
Very peaceful nice work.
Thanks for the inspiration !!!!
That's nice!
I like your design, and the loft makes it bear safe I would think, unless he can climb a ladder!
It feels good when you build things with your hands. the cabin looks great,
Whats the name of the song at the end?
The cabin is fanstastic, but you have shouldn't do such a big logs alone, you could damage your backbone. The cabin is really beautifull, only you have should find some better solution for the ladder.
Pretty cool ay.
I've never asked for a permit from the government for building anything.  It's like when people buy a gun and ask where to register it.  Enthusiastic slave mentality is crazy shit.
what province are you in man? great video!
It's very cool. Simple is good. It makes me think of days gone by. Enjoyable project at least.
Sick cabin. I wish I knew how to build something like that but I'm 17 and have lived in the city all my life so I don't know a whole lot about construction and handy work.
Nice work! I can see myself living full time in a place like that.  Away from the hustle and bustle.. would be nice actually. Lol
Very good job and a way of making lodge in forest, I'm carpenter but I still need  basic help because it is very dangerous to work alone in forest  with tools and heavy wooden lumber..any way I've made something but less attractive for my hunting company..Thanks for sharing and take care, god blessed you!
Amazing
very cool, cool cabin and story, also like the old crow
_great job. I stayed in something similar in the Altai Mountains, in Siberia. (I do campus ministry over there)
The church and youth group are very lucky to have you. Well done.
Thanks for sharing. It reminds me of how I felt as a 3rd grader reading, My Side of the Mountain. I will build one my self some day.
God Bless You.
"Complicated offers bells and whistles, but simple, simple offers freedom." no truer words have been spoken.
I've done this before in The States. However, survivalism has kinda passed away as bureaucratic regulators now demand permits and codes, so they can set higher taxes. They even want expensive roads built to my property so they can come and inspect everything for even more taxes. I'll just walk everywhere & use my National Parks Pass. I can go anywhere I choose, stay a few days, then travel elsewhere. Those city people will never follow, nor find me. I won't even use camp grounds that charge money. I'll just camp in the bush away from money-mongers.
I love it!  Rustic and simple, yet so inviting.  And such a beautiful place!
You said 10x10 is a maximum legal size for building without permit in Ontario, but in your website http://www.offgridworld.com/500-off-grid-cabin-how-to-build-a-cabin-without-a-permit/, you wrote 20x20 is ok. So which one is right?
Hey man I don't want to nit pick because it seems like you have addressed everything in the video but the gaps in the door shouldn't be some blanket remedy you should actually make your house warm. I got to say though it must be nice to just sit there and relax or listen to guitar it is something that the many people are in need of though they are just not aware of it.
Looks like 10x14 with the 2nd floor loft. Did you break the law, pastor? Just because it was more convenient? Then lie about it in your video? Hmm? Sincerely, Charlie the Crow
Great log cabin you built there ;)
lol, no permit! it aint from my country then!
nice work
This is so cool, I would love to do this one day, but try to use as much of nature as possible and even less money but all in all $500 is really good, awesome man!!
Good job! Must feel great to have a place like that to go. Hope this inspires more to do the same. It's what we should all be doing. Take care in tour next venture
"Simple offers freedom.  Comlicated offers bells and whistles."  :)
are you wearing jeans? you're nuts
Feel great when I watched your video. You're amazing :-)
Get the youth group to help build one or two more mini cabins close to this one, then they would have a small summer camp.
looks great
That's an awesome back woods cabin! You did a great job!
How did you manage to get two sofas to your cabin?
my brother you did a great job...i will be trying this out....///thank you for the video
"I don't have any regrets at all..."  Awesome!  It's a rare man that can say that about something he built...  Great job!  Keep chasing simplicity!
you live in a beautiful country. In my country, you even must ask permit for the smallest garden-barn
Nice little story
I enjoyed this video, very neat little cabin. I know for a fact if I was lost in the bush and came across this.... I wouldn't care how many cracks there were or that the door wasn't bear proof... its a heck of a lot better than having to sleep in a tent or under a tree for survival!
Great place for the kids to get high and drunk on weekends
Several years ago they passed a rule that one could not build a new outhouse in most counties in Colorado. If one was already there, it could stay. It was amazing the number of people scrounging abandoned farms and ranches in eastern Colorado looking for outhouses they could steal and move to their cabin site.
Lame
Awesome, thanks for the quick answer :D and you did well, its a nice cabin and looks like its a very cozy place to nest down in for awhile.
building codes...what a joke, none of there damn business what someone does on there own land....biggest problem today, to much government intrusion....    cabin looks awesome, simple is so much better....the gaps/ imperfections do nothing but add character and charm as well as a personal touch....enjoy it!!!
when you say 10x 10 do u mean just the log part or does the overhang not included with the measurement?
i would really love to be able to build a cabin one day its a dream of mine my only problem is you still have to buy land!
You sir, are a good person. As I watch your video, I am reminded of Dick Proeneke. (sp). I have seen his videos at least 100 times. I am a wilderness junkie myself. I have land and have built a cabin on it, but it is a modern cabin of sorts. I would like to build a log cabin and think this year I will go out and harvest some logs. Anyway, I enjoyed your video. Keep up the good work and I hope other draw inspiration from your video like I have. Cheers from a friend in Canada.
love this!!...life is so much simpler and valued when youre in control of your own time and effort!!!!
nice job I can do it myself, im glad to see some people understand sometimes simple is the best. Nice job man..
The closest thing to this I will ever get is playing the game "the long dark" :)
I like how simple this cabin looks, and easy to build. Well done, one of  my favorites!
Amazing how long did it take to build how many hours
Did the G men want to include the sleeping loft over the porch as square footage in the building? BTW, you did a great job on the cabin. I built a somewhat larger house on land in Black Forest, Colorado.
It's sad that you have to spend the first part of the video explaining your choices to keep the haters at bay. There are so many jealous people out there who just want to poke holes in something that's getting a lot of attention when they're not. Rock on with your tiny cabin! You have the views that prove you did a hell of a lot right!
Absolutely beautiful!!!!Heat and shelter in the wilderness!!!!Simply put, perfect!!!!Very nice! Bring a girl next time.
I just purchased some land (5 acres) out in the country. Anyway, I will be buying a barn house shed, add porch, solar and little things for my getaway and for kiddo. I wish I had the time, talent  and patient to do something like that. Do you have a composting toilet? Looks great to me, anyway
I love the new America, less is more , big company may not make the money they use too if people keep living like this, BUT they brought it on them self's. and I believe the less you have in your way as far as thing's, the closer to the LORD you will stay , a win win in my book
Nice cabin, sure.  But how about that incredible land!  It must have cost you 100's of thousands.
Great cabin...nice "get away" for fun!  Do you get snow in July up there?
Its amazing - a local farmer donated a cabin to a youth organisation in our area - some of our fondest memories were weekends spent there in the snow - log fires - dubious cooking and breaking into song - we think its great that you let the young  enjoy your cabin
Amazing! I can come over from Australia and build myself a log cabin anywhere in Canada, no permit required!  Cool!
excellent video!
I bet the Northern Lights are great to see
I used to love forests, until they ruined my life... I got late stage lyme disease and it attacked my heart, my eyes, my brain...
Nice can I come see it
Simply awesome my friend. And the best is to share with others!!!
GOD BLESS YOU! TIS PPL LIKE YOU THAT KEEPS THE WORLD FROM BEING A TOTAL CESS POOL! PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MAL-CONTENTS.
INCREDIBLY AWESOME! VERY GOOD JOB!
this is great!
Neat cabin.  You built it on the cheap, and that allows for upgrades as time goes on.  You already have the roof sheeted, the church might find someone to donate the few squares of shingles to put the roof up proper.  As you said though, if the plastic tarps last for a few years at a spell, why fix it.
Who the hell hit the thumbs down? He made all the obvious reasons that people would use as the common criticisms clear at the beginning of the vid. Did a good job for what it was intended for and he donated it to his church whos land it is and were cool enough to let him build it in the first place. Good job my northern brethren eh. I guess you just cannot please some people. I am only leaving this comment to balance out the negative comments. Again good work bud
FUCK THAT LOL
Looks Great!! Very nice Job!!
I works for me as well!  I loved it!  I only wish I had the property to do it. :-)!! Did I hear mountain lions...?
peel the bark off the logs next time
You are a pleasant person. I like your narration and your confidence.  Please continue to post.....
Well done.
nice place
10X10 without a permit ay? they can be so generous in a free country when you're on your own land. can you build another near by? how close?
Brother, you are one noble human being. Stories like this give me hope for humanity. For 3 years now I have been saying that I'm leaving the lower 48 and moving off the grid into either AK or Canada, and building my own cabin. Is acreage cheap? Anyways, God bless and say hello to freedom for me, for one day I will be able to tell her myself.
Did you use all power tools, or did you use some old school tools such as a draw knife? I want to build my own cabin someday but I want to challenge myself to a build only using hand tools for all the major cuts. Also, I would love to keep the bark on. I wonder if there is something that can be brushed on to make the bark last longer?
No permit required?  i wonder which state you live in?
That looks like a little piece of paradise
If you are happy with it that's all that matters
Love it, great job!!
is it cold inside?
it looks amazing! well done!
We dont all have land available to do these things
A lot of these codes are nothing but a rip off. People started building in this country with no codes. Great cabin you did a good job.
I don't think that dirt floors and logs touching the ground will affect that cabin as much as people think. It all depends on the weather and how high the humidity is year round. I can tell you this. You use bodark wood it will last 200 years! That stuff is bullet proof!
great job! You have nailed it, keeping it as minimal as possible. Water, do you have a source for water? I could hide out there for the summer months, maybe even fall. great video. Thanks for sharing.
Wonderful pioneer spirit. Great project and decent job at construction. I would love to give the 'thumbs up' but cannot. I teach Biology to Christian teens and consider youth pastors my nemesis. I consider what you do to youngsters abusive. It hurts me to see them deal with their frustrations daily when I teach them the truth about Nature and its processes.
This video rocks... thanks for sharing... I think you did a great job... except where's the sauna and the steam room for those cold winter nights? JK bout that and I am sure all those who began to nit pick your construction methods would be the most grateful should they be caught in the area when a winter storm comes up.  Nice way to share the gospel to the relative strangers who assisted you building the cabin.
Built a small cabin myself after your first video. I built the majority of mine during the winter. I had to bring the lumber in on a sled with a 4wheeler. Cabin looks great.
this vidio should go go virol.....tis is te age of te fuken computers and on an on.....but when shit hits te fan ......wat u gonna do....money wont buy tis place....gold wont either....friends an family stick togeather...protect each other dont lie embellesh 2 each other ...b honest....there have and are great AMERICANS tat raised familys in cabins like tis throughout the history of this great land ....o by te way im one of tem ....GOD BLESS THE GREAT USA  i do not claim to b a great AMERICIAN but i was raised by them
i am very impressed....if things went bazzurk in the sitty....u will always survive
Whats the name of the song/music playing 10 minutes into the video?
I'd break my neck going down that ladder the 3 times a night I need to piss. :(
сразу видно руки из опы растут! не окорённое бревно короед сожрёт!
Other than the good video, you have also done a good narration. Congratulations.
This looks incredible, I was telling my step mom about this and she said I would love something like this because I'm a loner and she's exactly right. The narrative was especially entertaining. Great job!
We're about in America is that ? And I'm from England it the coldest we get in winter is -1 and that's only at night
Wonderful cabin, you are powerful, you got all my respect. Great video editing too. In what part of NA is that if it is not too much personal? Enjoy your cabin in the wild wood.
This video was nice but easily could have been trimmed by 10 minutes. I had to FF through most of the downtime of nothingness to get to the meat of the video.
your going to have to replace your tarp every year.
Nice cabin and video. Good work.
one can soak the bottom logs in creosote oil that will keep the bottom logs from rotting. or if u have flat rocks u can use them as a foundation to put your bottom roll of logs on. Plus the oil will keep them from rotting. Just and Idea
you so hard cord ! i like your cabin.
Whats the song at the end?
Just Wonderful
nice work, simple IS freedom!
You are AMAZING and so is your cabin. I swore I would never ever live with anyone again, I now have an exception!!  :)  JK. I am sending much LOVE and LIGHT your way♥♥
Beautiful!
I like the care and attention that went into making this video.
I enjoyed the original video, nice to see a return to this really great project.
Just to put it out there; Crows can remember 100+ human faces and even teach their children to recognize them. Also, they use tools which is pretty fuckin cool, too!
i really enjoy the way you narrate. well done my friend :)
You mentioned gathering on Saturday or after school, are you Seventh-Day Adventist?
Inspiring. Great work.
what type of trees did you use?  do you have wood eating insect problems?  anything you would have done differently?  it is a cool cabin.  I love it!
In the end, what did you use for flooring...I guess I missed that part
What is the name of tune at the end?
I do not like green eggs and ham.
That would be illegal in Michigan. Even if you own the land. You need a permit for everything. Even a fence.
Where can you build without needing to get a permit? I eagerly await a reply.
great job
clicked to watch the cabin be built but was distracted by your great ass.
did you ever spend the night in it?..Looks cozy..
Love It!
Where there is a will there is a way! Thanks be to our ancestors who built with their own hands, laid roads, built houses. If they had been afraid of 'what may happen to them in the process', we wouldnt be where we are today! Its time, people stopped sitting around watching tv and do some hard work with their hands!
If you see Charles again, remind him that he owes me $200...
Thanks for this story. These videos always inspire me to keep on saving my money in order to build my own small cabin/tiny house in the future. Subscribed!
Wow....what if you broke your leg out there. The lynx would eat you!
crows are very good in recognizing faces. There was a video I saw about it on Nat geo or discovery.
Greetings from Polish, Mielec (Europe), pastor Darek. :)
It awesome!  Is ur cabin warm egh? Cuz I see door and upstairs above the window can draft throu...... U own the land?
#Pennsylvania : Until the Property Tax Independence Act is passed/enacted, this may soon be my home as I can hardly afford the property taxes anymore!! #Poconos
http://www.nwf.org/news-and-magazines/national-wildlife/birds/archives/2013/crows-recognizing-faces.aspx  Maybe he did recognize you
very cool
loved the video OutsideFun1 cool build and it really is true even if its a crow a friends a friend !
How about the need for toilet paper and toothpicks...not to mention fresh milk or Oreos?
Very nice cabin
you 23 people who gave a thumbs down suck
very cozy
can't be late april! global warming man!!! ya didnt get the memo?
Awesome job man. Love it. Its always been a dream of mine to be able to do this and use it like a month or so out of the year and just be by myself. A few things tho: A) You did all this work, and donated it? Youre a better man than I, my friend! B) You say it only cost $500 to build, but how many hours did it take you? Why not put a value on time involved? Unless its just a labor of love.
How can you "donate" something you don't even own... lol
Simple Offers Freedom
Pretty nice! Thanks for the share.
Great job...love this..
12:06 Slenderman!
WoW! That's  one unique cabin!  I love the loft.     I wonder how difficult it was to heat?   Nice video.   Tell charly I said Hi the next time you visit....;)
Scratching my head, why did you do this in the winter?
Nice job!  Nothing like hearing the wind and wildlife.
Nice job!  God bless.
Well done!
Good!  "Crow" is a familiar spirit and is a trickster but can be very beneficial.  As Crow Spirit if you need to know something or something got lost and you would like it back.  When it appears, thank Crow and be kind to any member of the crow family.  Greetings from France via North America, long ago.
Like number 666....not the antichrist! !! What kind of wood is that?? Thanks in advance. Love the project.
No need permit 'cause church gave permission. Nice cabin!
Good idea, but USA door just stupid, its should open to out. not in. so it will easy seal. and safe to bear.....
You should have stripped the bark off so the wood cures faster. The bark will cause it to rot!
This was a very cool video
Nice job, you know youtubers very well,its sad u have to explain yourself to a bunch of critics that can't find good in anything
Very very nice.  Well done and inspiring.  Thanks.
This is about the coolest of the small cabins I've seen on you tube etc. and to top it off is built in a frugal manner.
Loved the video.
is it on crown land?
Beautiful work thanks for sharing your video, Gob Bless your soul for sacrificing your time for the youths of today, would you mind sharing as well the music you played for this video.
Lovely video man! Very good work and very inspiring to watch :)
Theoretically, how would one deal with waste if you were to live there? Would a composting toilet work in that climate? Or would you need to use a septic tank, in which case itd have to be emptied by a truck which would need a road..
What do you eat or how do you get food when you are staying in the cabin? Cheers
that's cool bro.
you have done a fantastic job. I wish I was able to build something like this.
Well done.  I especially liked your cinematography 9 to t10 min into the video with the snow falling.
Were the logs harvested on site?
What part of Canada?  Canada's a big country.  Don't tell me you're afraid of telling us where.
Amazing!
Perfect. A perfect video I thank you God Bless
Very nice job.i hope to get started on my family cabin this spring im jest working on getting a chunk of land that i like away from city life cuz my kids and i dont care for the city at all and the farther back north we can get the better but if i dont get the land by spring i all ready have a back up chunk of land to build on jest not as far north as we want.any how my cabin design is close to yours i will have a loft on both ends for bedrooms and another building up on ten foot post for storing for and stuff and all so my water tank so we can have running water with out a pump running all the time.we will be totally off grid solar and wind power maybe water power if i get the land i want. Good video be nice to see some more vids if you start another cabin. Im not shur if you heard of a chainsaw mill but thay are handy and cheap and are very good for cabin building because you can make your own lumber. Good luck on your next cabin.
awesome videos. I love it. Thanks
I LOVE THESE TINY HOUSES!
Wow, that is awesome!!!
You said...in the end it works for me. Isn't that what truly counts?
I am always impressed with the knowledge that people have to do these things.  Eventually I would like to live in my own place away from the noise of neighbors in a where I don't have to pay a mortgage or electricity!!  I love it.  It looks wonderful inside and out!!
I wish you well, I love this video - it was so enchanting to watch...God Bless
thankyou so much for sharing this ,its lovely :) and now i will make my own [or will try ] x
It looks really cute and cozy. I can imagine the beautiful colors of the trees and flowers during the warmer seasons.
Nice work! :) Looks good
I subscribed when you did your Quinzee video and told the story about you and your Dad.  Your an inspiration my friend. God Bless Peace
Hi, nice job! There were many of you, why did not you build a big log house?
haha the narrative part sounded like alone in the wilderness
this was made by a church group. nice try tho
This is cool!
Charles : ]
thats pretty awesome, I'm not nearly as north as you are, but still north nonetheless. If I really wanted to, could 1500 - 2000 make a more permanent/durable  and 'comfortable' setting? If I was to build one, i'd maybe want it a little bigger, say 20 by 20 feet or so. Plus, what would you do for a bathroom/shower? If I was to make one i'd like something of the sort. And something to cook with or store food?
FIX thin planks horizontally across the door to close the gaps.
Nice work! May God protect you always!
Do you own the land, or you just built it in the middle of nowhere?  You should have rented it out.  Looks like a very cool place, but cold in the winter.  Nice video.
Very nice. thanks for sharing.
Great Video my friend. My Daughter and I are about to do the same next year. Good to see you are a Christian and not scared to share his faith. My God richly bless you.
How do you know his name is not Edgar?
you should build another one w/ the youth group
nice job and it makes you happy so great job
Sweet video! You must be very self-sufficient and resourceful to build such a cabin! Congrats on a job well done! Take THAT, Mr, Bear! :-)
Not to worry about all the cracks. Simply cover the interior with styrofoam insulation panels. Just a knife and some resins/tape.  A small barrel wood burning stove should be enough once its insulated.
I want to build a log cabin one of these days, and this video has inspired me to do so, and I think it's cool that your a youth pastor
Great video but I'm sorry Charles didn't have a mate... it's anomalous to see one raven surviving on it's own...
Holy dude you are skilled.. When you picked up those full size logs by yourself i felt over exerted just watching. Hahah nice job bud.
That's really cool.
I felt the emotion, I saw the first video
Great job
That is so awesome!!
Nice work mate, as long as you like it who cares what anyone else thinks
Amazing video. I would love to build a small cabin like this. Reminds me Dick Proenneke's Alone in Wilderness.
I love it. Think I could rent it next summer?
Pretty impressive.
I love your videos. I think I watch them once a week! Very calming in my concrete jungle.
Like I said before awesome cabin:-)
Good job, i wish i could do that in mexico, buts its just too risky to stay on the woods
Nice editing!  Like Dick P. I bet it's a right pain to re-walk the same shot to get that 'look'!
This is amazing! It looks freezing though. You northern folk sure are hardy.
what state do you live in
disregard females, aquire log cabin.
Excellent video!  Thanks for sharing.  Love the cabin exactly the way you chose to build it.
Nice that it is still around and in good standing.  I forgot, what was the propane bottle for above the stove?
Gr8 job !
wow, time mark at 6:34 with the light coming straight down and the cuts on the logs by the top of the door looks like a cross, too cool.
Nice update will be good to watch the next cabin being built.
nice vid, keep the good work up :)
What did you use to put in between the logs?
nice video.
Thank you for such an amazing video.  Reminds me of Dick Proenneke's film- Alone in the Wilderness.  Had a very nice mellow vibe to it.  Thanks again, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thumbs up!
