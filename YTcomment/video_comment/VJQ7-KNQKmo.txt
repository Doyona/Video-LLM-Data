There's very much deformation of the wax ring by the toilet. It didn't have good contact.
i mean that uneven floor
“make this toilet sit flush”
They mentioned using putty to close the gap after shimming - to make it look better. What kind of putty would be best? It would need to be something that would set or dry because if it was tacky then dirt / debris / pet hair stick would to it.  It would also need to hold up to cleaning products used for mopping the floor and cleaning the toilet.
Floor should have be fixed first.   You guys put a bandaid on an issue that could have been fixed just as easy.  Take of molding, pull floor pieces.  Shim under floor.  Put toilet back and level.  Put molding on and hit it nail gun.  That gap is gonna be an eyesore.  Everyone entering the bathroom will see it and wonder what is going on.  Good plumbing work, but the floor should have been addressed first.
Waterproof Self Adhesive Caulk tape, can make that gap pretty. Please don't use ANYTHING pourous like plaster of paris because when or if any moisture from mopping, a failure in the seal or bathroom mishap occurs you are dealing with a sloppy moldy mess.  Another option could be backer rod and caulking.  In any case, code expects this gap to be sealed. Many folks will leave a small opening at the back to act as an alert if there is a failure with the seal before extensive damage can occur with a wood(not slab floor.
I love this old house. We are the first-time homeowners of a 130+ year-old house, and this has saved us.
Love this Old House
One word - shim.
👏👏👏👏👏👏💪💪💪💪👍👍👍👍👍
Hey, Rich, you took my advice & put some gloves on ... ata boy. (I wanna be on one of your shows)...  Also, when I do have to use shims, & it's rare, I use a little dab of clear silicone, so they won't move or slide around or 'drop out' over time. If they do move, your back to sq one. Then it's time to pull up the floor & figure that out. I would have actually tried to address the floor issue 1st. Great job tho Rich. You da man!!
Self leveler doest cost that much last I checked. That 90s bathroom needs a remodel anyways
Those shims look terrible....
Made a nice home for  roaches and mice to live under your toilet.  Gap is totally unacceptable!!!!  Caulk it baby or your not getting paid for the service call.
The homeowner is now a Pre-Apprentice; grabbing the Plumber's tools and guiding him when installing the toilet.
Thanks a billy. Real help. Solid
A wobbly toilet is a pretty crappy situation.
@6:40 - "The beauty here is that if this puppy leaks, you will be the first to know."
That gap would be a major major eye sore.   Seal it but leave gap in the back.
That’s a huge gap!  Your bead is going to be 1” high.
Giant gap, cant imagine caulking that
Good video and quick solution for the problem at hand.  I laughed though when he said a $1000 to fix the floor. $1000 in 2024 would even get you close to taking out the vanity, floor and subfloor.  Then you would need to repair the joists, install new subfloor, floor, vanity and then toilet.
Real men don’t use gloves
The lack of cursing makes you realize this is fake
that foam seal should  be failing right about now if it hasn't yet
Sit 'flush'😂
I wouldn't have utilized plastic shims. Instead, I would have used plaster... Mix up a batch of plaster and quickly set your tolit on top of it... Once the plaster hardened, the tolit would remain forever level... The plaster could have been cleaned up nicely around the gaps, making for a nice look all around the tolit base.....
That would drive me crazy seeing that gap around the toilet
1/2 in that  floor  need  to be fix.
You guys are kidding me right that’s not how you do it😅
Do it the right way, replace that section of the floor.
Wouldn't this be a temp fix until fix the floor???
That gab is Insane
Just me but it looks like you put a Band Aid on a broken Bone The Floor
wrong. Caulking is code for many states.
Thanks for showing us how NOT to install a toilet !
Thank you very much for the very helpful tutorial. I am surprised the fix is far more simpler than I thought it would be.
At 0:28, I thought Richard was actually "picking" out something to help him with the repairs, Haha!
Thank you! I think this is exactly what we need to know; 6 people, 1 sliding toilet, (the silicone between the tile floor and the toilet has turned slimy and useless in five years since we installed it) This leads me to believe I don’t need to put silicone between the floor and the toilet, but I can put it around the base if I choose, correct?
Gross he drained the toilet with a sponge and placed it on the counter. This plumber is fired if he works like an inconsiderate pig like that.
Salty AF I can't fix my toilet until I renovate the rest of the bathroom bc someone thought it'd be dope if the counter went over top the back of the toilet. Can't even get the toilet out 🫠
WOW!! Absolutely fabulous video! This is a saved to home projects video! Thank you so much!❤️🙌🏻☕️
My flange is too tall.  Rather than use those ugly spacers, tomorrow I'm going to turn my toilet upside down, trace out the base on cement board, cut it out then lay it down and reinstall the toilet.
in the top 10 youtube channels of all time--love this show and no unneeded drama!
I suggest fixing the floor first then do the toilet.  Now he'll hsve huge gaps on the sides....
I have the same problem, but my BR has a new level tiled floor, either I need a thinner wax ring or this is just common when the flange sits higher than the floor.
Just after 1:30, watch how the floor itself moves when the toilet is rocked. I wonder if the subfloor plywood is rotted, allowing way more movement than you should see. I never liked hardwood flooring in bathrooms or kitchens. Repair of subflooring is too complicated.
Great job!
They actually make a powder you pour into the tpilet snd it makes ot solidify and you dont have to sponge out the nasty water like that.
the shims instantly shift and cause wobble again
After replacing my wax ring my toilet still leaks at the bottom front of the bowl. What you recommend to do next.  Apparently the leak started after putting those blue tablets inside the tank.  What should I do next to stop the leak at the bottom front of the bowl?
Sit the toilet on a bed of plaster of paris and the shims to level. Then a nice bead of caulk around the base - Looks good and solves the problem. Works every time!
Excellent video
Do your best caulk the rest
My guy just toilet sponge the counter?
Never seen such an elevated toilet wtf?
not a permanant fix, call norm
THATS A SEXY WAX RING
eeeek
Nice work.
He sucked the water out of the toilet with the sponge and then put the sponge on the counter 🤮
Looks horrible.. looks like a small bathroom.. just fix the floorboards
Caulk please. Provide some stability to those shims and cover up those gaping holes
How does someone have floorboards in the bathroom with quarter inch gaps?!?! Completely unsealed!
Thank you! I happened to have some rubber shims, those will have to do
Caulking on a gap that big?
Looks like crap and the guy is a moron for crushing that washer.
Garbage video. Don’t do this. Fix the problem
Haha toilet sits flush
This is great 👍.  .!!  Thank you gentlemen..
That looks like dogshit.
"No purchase on the top of this China" That's frickin rich.
Good video! I'd like to add that I really wish they would only use stainless steel for the toilet flange screws or bolts! Every time I've had to lift or replace a toilet the bolts have been rusted. I usually have to cut them because they are so corroded the nuts won't turn.
I used a wet / dry vac to remove the bit of water left in the bowl
I would've ended up making multiple trips to Ace to get those parts.
This is the first TOH video I've seen where the project was incomplete.. ...seriously Richard?...you actually gonna walk away from that so called install??
🤮 Sorry but that was disgusting.  He took the sponge directly from the toilet (0:55) and put it on the bathroom counter.  They said this toilet has been wobbly for a few weeks and you can see how rusty the bolts were. That toilet has been used.  That is really disgusting.
The house I was looking into buying has a loose toilet, hopefully it isn't a weak floor.
horrible looking fix.  Come on, this is a cop out. who is going to clean under the toilet now...
Oh yeah, I can see a 70-year-old woman living alone doing THAT.
Nice. Helped me fix the problem in 20 minutes.
You didn't display the shims the plastic shims
I am allays worries about breaking the toilet when tightening these bolts. Does anyone know if there is torque setting recommended for the bolts
Lazy. Fix the Rotted floor first, or skip the video.  Expected a professional job
professional shim job lol
shimmed the lid so it's level, left the toilet tight to the floor
I like to use a toiletmaster lift jack to move toilets because I have a bad back and it makes it much easier. I added locking wheels to mine.  I used the toiletmaster bolts that have caps that thread on but they have popped off and they allow the toilet to pivot on the flange (so I can't recommend them). I will have to look for those lock washers. Those would have come in handy when we were trying to install my friend's toilet and the bolts kept tipping. I would NEVER use those foam gaskets. They delaminate and then the foam inside gets saturated and its disgusting. I do use a silicone "better than wax" seal though. I haven't had any problems with it thus far. I have used those shims but because my floor is not stable (it was a replacement piece that wasn't tacked in well so it doesn't have enough support-- and its OSB so it is not as strong as plywood) the toilet still rocks a bit. I did not realize the shims stacked like that though. That will come in handy. They sell extra all toilet bolt caps if you don't want to cut or break away the long bolts.
Against the CHY NA!
The shims will move eventually. Use rubber gasket with silicone to attach to base of toilet.
He doesn't know how to talk just like they sawer up top shouldn't it be saw up top not sawer
ONE THING to make the job a little easier:  Remove the toilet lid before lifting it. Removing that top heavy weight makes it a  bit easier to manage that way.
I would fix the floor
good stufffff,, again,,
Thank you …. For your instructions….
I saw an episode where they drew a template or a pattern around some wood in an episode like this one does anybody remember it?
This is great! Big help!!
Thank you for saying caulking around the toilet is cosmetic.
Yo babies. I'm laying here naked in my warm bed and watching Richard fix a toilet 🚽. Love it.! ❤️
30$ hour to boss me!
Is he paying him to boss him?
That rusted not must be cut off.
Should have at least cleaned the toilet and area around it before TOH showed up. Jeez
A very good demonstration on how to get rid of a wobbly toilet on a solid floor, but in this case the floor must be repaired first. If you watch the video, when you wobble the toilet the floor moves with the toilet. Repair the floor and give the toilet a solid base, then use shims if you need them.
Come on guys! Can't you see that it's sitting that high because the foam ring won't compress the way that wax will. This is the first This Old House video that I've seen that is way off the mark. And I'm very disappointed that Richard used that foam ring that increased the height, therefore increasing the wobble requiring all of those shims.
Words you never want to hear from a plumber. I don't think I've ever seen a floor this far out.
That thing was an inch off. No way in hell that thing didn't leak
I'm not sure this is the way I would have done this.  It's a fix, but not the right fix.  Personally, I would have created a template under the toilet using wood to fill the void underneath.
Will the toilet smell with that big lopsided situation going on? Does that tilt affect the seal?
Well first off why wear gloves if after you use your sponge to soak up all that nasty toilet water and then sit the sponge on the sink then with still same gloves on going to pick up your level. I lost all confidence in the video and stopped here. Have a wonderful day.
The inside of the old sewer pipe was so rough I don't see how the expanded rubber seal could seal well enough to keep sewer gas from seeping past it.
That was soo wrong and sad. Horrible information
Thanks for the tips
I'm wondering what happened to the floor . Looks like it''s moving quite a bit.
YEAH  BUT ALL THIS IS A LITTLE BULLSHIT YOU CANT DO IT IN THAT QUICK OF TIME. YES SOME THINGS BUT IT NEVER GOES THAT SMOOTHLY NOT EVEN OUT OF BREATHE
1:32 looks like the whole floor board moves (looks like maybe there is no subflloor)  - with some luck find appropriate joist underneath and nail floorboard to joist and hopefully the floor won't move anymore
Nice repair, but the gap is ridiculous, should be finished out.
1:20 - Close the Lid before sticking your face into it!…GROSS!!!
Your a hack Richard. Use a real wax, not that trash
How would you fix a wobbly basement toilet that uses 4 bolts to anchor it, where the bolts go into the concrete floor. The idiot that installed the toilet used tree branches to take up the space in the bolt holes and the branches have rotted? This was done by a “Professional Plumber” who replaced the toilet in 2006 while my parents owned the house.
Anyone ever come home after working all weekend to find the toilet leaking at the handle???!! Something to fix since we’re under quarantine now 🤨🤨😷
The fact that the floor isn't properly mounted to the subfloor, isn't level, and isn't stable, I'm sure didn't help :P
I thought that was Jean-Claude Van Damme
Shouldn’t have reinstalled that toilet until the flooring was fixed.. Yes it works and is level but it looks horrendous
Now I know what to do to fix my wobbly toilet..thank you!! I hide the shims with toilet rug!
Idk man that gap is preeeeety big
I have a wobbly toilet and I hope my neighbor does not mind.
that is not the right way to repair the toilet to the floor. it is only a temporary fix. within about 1:34 minute you can see the whole floor move. you need to get a real plumber to remove the toilet and the floor boards because i bet there is some rotting floor joist. and yes they should have sent Tommy instead. to me this is not the standard of Ask This Old House should stride to.
How dose the sani green seal hold up Compared to a wax ring
Its making me cringe watching him reach into the toilet.
This is not good enough. This is B.S. repair .
I’d pull the flr. tile and lvl that flr., that looks shoddy as hell !!
This is really poorly done. Richard should be ashamed of this. One issue that wasn't addressed at all is how much flex the floor boards have 1:30. As far as sealing the toilet base goes, I'm a big fan. I know this case is pretty extreme but it can and should be done. A lot of plumbers say they don't like doing it but that's because they don't like having to break the seal for maintenance. The reality is piss from missing the bowl and water from the toilet sweating in humid weather get under the toilet and that's just unacceptable in 2021. Now what about those shims? They are the worst. They're so hard you can't trim them off and like this video shows they stick out. The best shim is a plastic carpentry shim. They don't rot and they cut easy so you can put a silicone seal between the floor and toilet. Again, this was a hack job.
So am I the only one that noticed the plumber stuck a sponge into a toilet bowl. Then sat it on the vanity? 🤢🤮
0:54 surely there was a better spot to put the sponge down then on the counter xD
I love this guys ,good memories, excellent video,thanks for sharing
He put that toilet water soaked sponge on the sink counter 🤮
I had those toilets at my school, they always clogged, but they have been replaced since.
If this bhutt is a hobblin don’t come a wobblin
4:33 - "I don't think I've ever seen a floor this far out". The program is called This Old House, no? Come to my home built in 1895 and I'll show you some floors with peaks and valleys.
Good job! But, did you need to shield around the toilet?
A temporary fix, because you didn't fix the reason the floor is sagging. So it's going to continue to sag...
I will be adding blocking under a toilet flange to fix my wobbly toilet.  The original builders cut the hole in the sub-floor so big 4/6 flange screws weren't even completely surrounded by wood.
He needed Tommy there for the floor.💪
Great job, but the gap would burst my head. Maybe some dark brown silicone, but still annoying. As you explained a few other options but more money.  Cheers
I would have thought using that thickness of shims it would not have sealed fully.
Battle
I'd call this "fix" half-assed, but that'd be too generous!
Glad to see him finally wearing rubber surgical gloves. It always made me cringe watching him touching sewage and dirty toilets.
I wood Love a this old House tshirt.. My address is 1635 sunset ..wauckegan ill.60087...please thankyou.have a great day guys.....my name is Howard glatt....
This old house is a great show i learner alot thanks tom richard kevin ..yu guys are great id. Live r o meet yu fellas....
Howard glatt from chicago i love yur show. I leadernd a lot fro yu guys .thanks
Looks terrible tho 🤣😂 I’d almost prefer the wobble
Hey Rich use a small wet dry vac to get the water out of the toilet instead of a sponge or a rag
I think the floor should have at least been looked at from below before starting that job.  This one's a hack.
Ugliest repair ever!
That sani seal has a lot of terrible reviews on Amazon
Note to homeowner... clean the vanity countertop.  He set the sponge he used to soak the toilet water on it! Haha!!!!
That toilets not going anywhere.
I'm wearing gloves for a reason.
You just know he want's to say gosh darn it.
Welcome to my Saturday afternoon.
I do not like this fix. Not professional. They might as well to fix the flange.
Ahhhhhh! He puts the sponge on the counter.
I guess he is just a heavy shi ter of a man
you can also have a rocking toilet problem if the closet flange sticks up too high.  my flange is one that goes down into the drain pipe and grabs on from the inside.  because previous owners took out the original floor it left enough cast iron pipe sticking up so that the flange was 3/4" above the floor and no matter how hard you tightened the bolts the toiled base would not contact the floor and be stable.  I shimmed around the base but eventually the shims all migrated under the base and lost contact.  So bought a 1/2"x2'x4' piece of white pvc board and cut out the exact shape of the toilet base with an 8" circle cut out to fit over the flange.  I put a few screws into the pvc to keep it from shifting and bolted the toilet back on top of it.  Now all edges of the toilet are supported and it doesnt rock.  TIP----  When you bolt down the toilet use heavier flange bolts and stainless steel nuts, and several rubber washers with stainless steel fender washers on top of the rubber.  this spreads out the force and cushions the washers from applying concentrated force to the base which can easily crack it.  if you dont go too big on the washers all will be hidden under the decorative closet bolt caps
I have never seen one that far out either . Half inch in that short of area is crazy
Who would leave there toilet with that being the fix??!!
Don't let the 47% of Americans who are OBESE sit on your toilet.
Lift with ur arms and ur lower back.. take ur legs completely out of the equation .. always amazing work!
Those shims look terrible, I could not live with that
Wow, i saw this 2018 sorry to say this but that seal waxless toilet gasket in 2021. Get the wax not waxless.  Yall have bless day 😄
What about bugs coming up because the toilet has gaps underneath now?
that fix looks like crap. no pun intended. not professional at all
Oh gee.. and now it looks like absolute garbage. You can't caulk that. Seriously???? You have to flush cut those shims and the caulking would have massive gap. Gotta do it right and fix the floor.
why not tighten down to floor then shim the low side? Like installing a door
Nothing like a po po sponge on the counter ....
Homeowner says just changed was seal, dude like this how’s you remove toilet. Like duh
I'm on camera right now,wanna run down to my truck and get my tools while I deal with your s#$@
Homeowner replaced the wax seal and didn't notice his crap bolts lol
These comment sections never fail to make my day.
Did you see how the horn was folding back up towards the toilet? That would make me eliminate that option completely from my plumbing arsenal. That is screaming for leaks.
mank this is exactly what I am looking for! thank you!
Wow, temporary fix at best
We’re not gonna discuss why the floor is 3/4” A foot out of level? This one is crazy.
The way toilets are mounted is inherently a bad design.
Shim thats not shim thats a dam platform
Am I the only one that noticed he used a sponge in the toilet and then stuck it on the counter? 🤦‍♂️  It was moved at the next shot.
Anyone have pros and cons about the green gasket he used
Has anybody ever looked for a high spot on the floor or toilet base?  Maybe a little sanding or grinding of the high spot would create a flush surface.  In my case, I'm hoping one of the floor tiles has a little high spot that I can grind down.  I'd rather not use shims because I think they might slide back out over time.
There's no purchase on the top of THIS china, guys
Are we just gonna ignore the fact he put the poo sponge on the guy’s countertop?
That’s the kind of shitty fix that an unlicensed guy would do. I think the owner better call Mike Holmes.
OK let's test this out jim, stay right here
Guy just lays the sponge he used to soak up water out of the bowl on the sink counter.
Hi,Please refer to our site for repairs of bathtub & shower cabin https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://rominashopping.com/%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B9%25D9%2585%25DB%258C%25D8%25B1-%25D8%25AA%25D9%2588%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25AA-%25D9%2581%25D8%25B1%25D9%2586%25DA%25AF%25DB%258C88042174%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B9%25D9%2585%25DB%258C%25D8%25B1-%25D9%2588%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2587%25D9%2586%25DA%25AF-%25D8%25AF%25DB%258C%25D9%2588%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B1/&ved=2ahUKEwiAtKDnmqTtAhXDmFwKHStMAbU4FBAWMAd6BAgDEAE&usg=AOvVaw1JsKJyryrXFCxUOJC1KH4Q
Toilet water sponge laid on  the vanity. Yuck!
Why not just level the floor?
Ok,got it shimmied a couple inches off the floor,you got it,right?
A true professional always gets the homeowner to go grab his tools from the truck.
Just call roto rooter they will get it fix
Anyone grossed out he put the toilet sponge on the counter
ya know shimming that floor is really not solving the problem. a carpenter should haven been called to fix the floor support which is probably rotted or broken underneath. those shims wont help when the toilet falls thru the floor
Splendidly to see Woodglut have new plans which helped me save some money and energy for this construction.
What if there is no cap to protect it from male urine ?
That is a huge gap! That sucks.
I have done very similar with Woodglut designs.
Toilet shorter on right than left? No worries just wear a regular shoe on one foot and a flip flop on the other. Problem solved.
Was that sink counter top sterilized after that bowl sponge was laid on it?
Buy a u shaped toilet rug
I'm going to anonymously send this video to a few ppl who's toilets are wobbly 🤗😎 starting with my mother in law
I wish every time I pull the toilet off a floor it look like when he did never the case totally staged
... So if a car has sagging suspension problem on one side... Just install a bigger diameter tire. :(
Iv'e always used nickels for shims. You can get them 5 for a quarter.
I remember setting toilets on a bed of plaster of Paris to compensate for any floor distortions. A bed of plaster evenly distributes the load around the toilet rather than just at two points (level wedges) you can easily trim off any squeeze out that may occur
Cmon Richard.... Why didn't you set the toilet I structolite !!! Like any old school NY plumber has been setting toilets for 80 years !!!!
He only wear gloves on a guy’s toilet.
That’s terrible plumbing.
Looks terrible, at least run a nice bead of clear silicone on huge gap.
guys, this was a rush job.  customer will not be satisfied for very long.  replace the rotten floor.  bad job guys.
This is the first time im seeing him wear gloves lol
Thank you so much. You are awesome!
I've done this work endless times and only watched to see if I could get a new angle on it, but nope. Same ol same ol. This is a temp repair only. At least he somewhat admitted at the end it was only to get the toilet functional, but that's not long term at all. He should have been clear from the beginning. The cause of the sagging floor has to be addressed and repaired or this problem isn't going away.
appliance.academy
1:23 Eric O has entered the chat: THERES YOUR PROBLEM LADY!
Thanks for the clear, easy to understand video.
I would have cleaned that toilet within an inch of its life before I even thought about getting the water out of it like he did.
How many watching this while using the toilet?
I don't see how a *sloping* floor would make the toilet wobble. Unless the plane of the floor was actually *curved* i.e. not flat. My toilet is rocking also but I am very reluctant to try this.
That's awful !!!
I’ve seen real plumbers fill that gap with plaster of Paris. That would spread the load out evenly across the entire bottom of the toilet. But that would be too much like work and yes it’s a messy job.
Thanks, I will imitation!
That floor joist is broken.
Very informative, ty for posting this video
What about plaster of paris? That would've been hard as a rock for general stability purpose.
Looks like crap with the shims showing.
Horrible tu reparación. From Chile
Holy crap he’s wearing gloves
Omg he put the sponge on the counter top
The filthy sponge out on the bench... gross
I would look into the problem, not trying to patch it, sloppy job
Needs more shims
I have to this at my house!
First rule plumbers don’t put their hands near their face, he picks his nose and goes at it😂
01: 48 Your arm is inside the toilet ew
Wow this is a master plumber
Finally I fix my toilet 🚽 no more rocking
Shims that high are a huge cosmetic issue and more than that, things can roll under there or breed under there.  I'd call that a temporary fix until the floor issues are resolved.
Functionally that seems to work okay, but it sure looks bad with those shims so exposed.
This video is just a quick fix for the toilet wobble. To do it right you need to pull up the sub floor and replace it and make it level. Through those dam shims away.
Wood floors are dirty in a bathroom.  Change the for to tile.
why doesnt Mr. T  use  a different cutting tool for the bolts, like a multi tool or a reciprocating saw?
Would have used Plater of Paris
Wife will NOT be happy...
This is a bad fix. They should have fixed the floor first before putting the toilet back.
His Aunt Ethel will have to use the toilet in the other bathroom until she gets her gastric bypass.
Richard, u just put the toilet sponge on the counter . . .
Fixed the symptom Not the cause. 🙈
wait, so Rich does own gloves?  Didn't need him for the 100 year old toilet fix lol
Is it possible for a toilet to be manufactured incorrectly?  I replaced a toilet in my house, the old toilet was level without shims, the floor is level, the flange is level, but the new toilet wobbles.  I had to add a shim on one side to make it level
What a hack job. You seriously just shimmed a toilet with plastic shims? Looks like a quick fix with out diagnosing the real problem. Maybe you guys should add a plumber to the show....
Lol!   Between the floor and the sponge on the counter... Better to just buy a new house!
Gosh everybody....give em a break!
"Sister the joist"?   Does that mean attaching additional 2 X 6's or 2 X 8's along side the joists, only a little higher,  so as to level out the sub-floor support?
Wow, I did almost the exact same thing, except I put adhesive under, over and between those wedges, then filled the gap with construction adhesive then calk.
At least there wasn't a turd in the toilet.
I agree with many of these comments that is just simply way too much shimming..... What's the toilet being that off it is absolutely time to fix the floor.
I bet Richard has Smaht Pahk :-)
6:50 Tony Soprano, "The Plumber". That's code for ' my job's done here'
1st) remove water from the toilet bowl with a sponge and then put it on the vanity top?  WOW... No Bacteria transfer here... 2nd) the Floor is so bad, the Sub-floor is giving way... THAT is why it dropped 1/2" or more... 3rd) Out of the 6 pieces shown at the end, the 2 pieces missing had nothing to do with how solid the toilet was being held down & in place... 4th) That foam ring will dissolve with any caustic chemicals tossed down the toilet for cleaning or torn with any snakes... Been there - Seen It, Went back to Wax Rings... Safer, Reliable, Longer Lasting, Proven track record...
super helpful! Thanks
There are times when you have to take your losses and set fire to the house and walk away. When the insurance adjuster shows up, tell him the plumber was smoking on the sh*tter and burned the whole place down! 👍🚬👍👌
I just installed myself a toilet. My father (very handy) told me to put plaster of Paris under the toilet. I didn't do it. Like every kid that doesn't listen. This guy definitely could have benefited from it. I wonder what people have to say about it, in general.
Ok fine you can’t leave the commode crooked looking I agree.  BUT there’s no way you should leave a commode shimmed like this. This cure is worse than the disease. Fix the floor or set the commode flat and come back and FIX THE FLOOR. $1000 to fix that floor is beyond ridiculous. $500-$650 tops. Personally I would not have set that commode on that floor. That floor has to be soft and using that commode could actually be dangerous.
Holy crap Batman he needs a new house
I thought I’ve shimmed some toilets. Boy was I wrong. I feel sorry for the poor bastard that’s gotta caulk that.  No self respecting plumber would leave a toilet like that. Shame on u.
Come on guys!! That gap was huge! There is no fix to that ugly mess!
I'm guessing a set of ratchet wrenches would be to fast and you would have to charge less
Wow that was the horrible job how about just going into the cellar jacking up the area on the side and shimming underneath link between the subfloor and the joists how about that that's horrible I would have been laughed out of the house
I often find on foundations with crawl spaces or basements that a plumber has cut a floor joist to get the 4 inch drainpipe up through a floor then sisters a 2x6 or 2x8 on the opposite side of the floor joist . Over time the patched joist starts to loosen in the gap and flex at the point it was cut allowing the floor to sink. If the sistered joist isnt sitting on a stem wall on both sides or at the least doesnt extend the length of the floor on both sides of the toilet and isnt secured with 3/8ths carriage bolts ,washers and nuts the length of the board the floor will flex under the toilet over time.
Nooooooooooo.
Jesus christ atleast at some plaster to give it some sort of base to make up for that floor..
This was very interesting to watch because when my late father and I installed a toilet in my bathroom many years ago. The floor was so uneven that we had to build  a wooden base for the toilet to sit on and it has worked out great ever since.
Mickey mouse. Better to build up a platform imo.
USE A SILICONE GASKET NOT WAX!
WILL YOU GO OVER THE "CAULKING THE TOILET TO THE FLOOR DISEASE"  PRETTY PLEASE? I'm sick of people doing this and they can't pay attention to when the toilet starts leaking
Always use a contractor bag on the floor to pull the toilet up and set it down onto so you don't get any water all over the floor or wax all over the flooring
NO WAY!!!!!!!!!........I've set 1,000's of toilets....do not set a toilet bowl like this!!!!!  1. if the closet ring is tight to the floor and wont pull up...continue to step 2. otherwise it has to be fastened down first...brass screws if you have some (code). 2. put a metal (supplied) washer and nut on bolts and fasten them tight to the ring on each side, toss that plastic washer thing..useless. 3. use 1 or 2 wax rings stacked up 4. set toilet bowl in place but don't push it down quite all the way. 5. add shims where needed to level toilet,  so it doesn't rock at all!... before tightening to bolts. ( i use vinyl flooring cut into little squares) like keeping a table from wobbling, pretend the toilet has ....four little legs.... the highest part of the floor under the bowl shouldn't need any shims. Tuck the shims slightly under the bowl so they don't show after caulk. 6. put a washer on each bolt and gently tighten nuts..... but not too tight....over tightening will not keep it from wobbling. 7.  caulk around toilet....any questions?
As Richard said at the end of the video it was a quick fix so they would have a toilet available quickly.     Personally I sure didn't like the large spacing on right side.
If I installed a  commode like that I would never have REPEAT customers.
I think I am guilty of putting my bolt cover base in upside down.
I think he did what he could to get it working for the short term, but I can not see the shim staying put for too long with the floor moving like that .
My goodness what a poop job literally, that toilet was 1/2” in the air bc that flange u used was too thick, seriously? Bob would smack you!
Not an expert at all but this looks like sh*t (no pun intended)
Good fix but needed to fix that gap
Nice one, helped our family out for sure. Thank you
I checked the google street view and that house is now a ground zero. The owner fell through all the way down to the basement with this toilet and the whole house collapsed and was sucked into that hole. I think the problem was he had that wooden floor instead of the tiles. Wood is not for bathrooms, toilets and kitchens, especially in an old houses.
That bathroom looks 100% like my grandmas. Paint and everything
Set it in grout.... easy peasy
Yo my man just told the home owner to go get his tools outta his truck. 😎
They sent the wrong man, they should have sent Tom Silver to level that floor!!
The way he installed that toilet I would have kicked this foo out of my house.🤦‍♂️
Amateur band aid vs professional band aid... somebody needs to fix the part of the house that failed underneath the toilet causing the floor issues..
I was taught to bed it in plaster if the floor is that uneven
1:56 when you take your cat to the vet
Yeah, the business, back in now.
@this old house would the hard ware store have the pieces  the home owner didn't have ?
This old house plumbing guy finally uses rubber gloves. 🎉🎈
the owner of the house should clean the toilet first
Should of had Tommy fix the floor.
these comments from DIYers and international viewers and contractors LMAO
A novice knows how to shim a toilet. An expert knows when.
just a warning.......don't eat while watching how to on toilet repair
that was a great tip...but he should've put the shims sideways running the side of the bowl...(following the edge) so you can put calking and the shims don't stick out...lol
Richard is thinking "I should have been a gardener so I wouldn't have my face in a toilet"
Don't ever use what he used for a seal. It absorbs moisture, will start to mold and stink within a few months. Always use wax, in this case using two wax seals would have worked great. Never buy the wax seals with the rubber fixture in the middle. That causes the flushed water to splash up and soak your floor. Just plain old wax and double up if needed when your flange is set too low or, in this case, when your flooring is totally out of level.
Shoulda called Steve Lav.
The sponge toilet seal is too big. it distorts all leveled floors. Just leave a wax ring and the wax stays set sealed. Plus beeswax is antigermacidal.
Being a plumber, watching this makes me cringe. This guy doesn’t have a clue.
Lol man oh man use some bolt cutters! We all know no one want to Cut it that way.
ive used calk around a moving toilet to provide a solid level base.  let it dry for 24 hours to harden up and it still works after 15 years...mine was no where near that severe.
The flange was too high
Those shims would drives me crazy, it looks awful.
Caulking around the bottom is not suggested, but if you really want to, don't caulk the back area so leaking water can escape and be visible.
For a Mansfield Vanquish toilet, installing the flange on top of the finished floor is too high.   The toilet will wobble/rock on the flange, even if it's screwed down.   If the manual says that "the top of flange should be level with the finished floor" there is a good chance that is correct.
I feel like the floor being that off leveled is a bigger issue than the toilet being wobbly....
I tapped on the video not even reading the title thinking it’s said, *how to make a gloryhole*
The wax seal is still better than that rubber foam seal crap.  That thing is less messy and much more convenient but after few years it starts leaking. Changed many customer because of that.
Love how he just calls out the owner like who’s the idiot who put this closet bolt in. Lmao
I prefer double washer and nut toilet bolts. One set of washer and nut against toilet flange, other set to secure toilet. Next time someone pulls that toilet, there is a good chance that the bolts will just spin thanks to that "lock washer". Probably should of, at least, tried to caulk/hide those shims.

Some people have found that these plastic donuts get water-logged and leak, or just leak because they don't keep a tight seal after installation.  Could you and your crew do a follow-up on the toilet you worked on in this video, before the homeowner calls you, and show your viewers  whether or not these seals will last for years, as is advertised?
The lock washers are crap. I like ro use a metal washer and nut to secure the scrrew
THE GROUT! PUT THE GROUT!
Raises toilet 2 stories and calls it good 😂👍
did he not change glove after touching the inside of a toilet bowl, EEEWWWWW!!!!
Or lay it in a bed of grout and fix it properly
As a temporary fix ok. But if you don't have time to do it right then you don't have time to do it over. I would suggest floating the floor out. Then a nice tile job.
So, he shims the toilet but does nothing about the gap at the bottom??????  Oh right, " it's just a cosmetic issue..." 😳 😂
Just address the cause of the problem.  Find out why that out of level condition exists.  When you correct that, a thousand other problems will be solved.
Would the wax seal, if it was wax, be level with the floor not the toilet and have the potential to allow water to leak off to the side when the toilet it adjusted to have a straight angle?
As a plumber that toilet will leak those shims are a joke
Never use those to seal the toilet to the floor always use the wax
The closet flange is NOT properly secured to the floor. You can’t stabilize the toilet if you can’t stabilize the closet flange   which holds the toilet.   The “all-weather screws” are screwed on to the flooring plank   instead of the underlayment or floor joist or anything substantial   because as you can see it’s moving at 1:30.    You don’t know what you’re doing   and you should stop giving bad instructions.
Shoulda just sent Phil Swift over there with a few cans of Flex Seal dogg... maybe some tape
When he put that sponge on the counter....
TOILET SPONGE on COUNTER ewwwwwwwwww
That looks like schit. Hack work.
GLOVES!!!!! Any idea how much piss is on that angle stop?
I'm glad he has gloves on.
This work can be more complicated than it appears.    A number of possible issues are not discussed.  That ring will only compress so much.  If the flange is to high or the toilet doesn't have enough height above the flange it won't sit firmly on the floor.  Shims may help but not always.  Video makes it appear to be an easy task.  If not done right, you could also get methane and/or sulfer dioxide in your house.  Both dangerous and at least one is deadly.
Time 4:50 -- levelled the toilet by use of shims.  BUT that does NOT stabilise the wonky floor.  It will and can still wobble.  That floor need the attention of a builder.  The structure underneath has probably rotted.
Read several reviews on the Home Depot site that this green donut delaminates and leaks.  BBW
Don't seal the toilet to the floor. If sealed, you won't be able to see a gasket leak - the water will ruin the floor structure under the toilet.
after doing major repair in my home  to 50 y/o toilet drain hold down ring/ lead skirt etc i  temp placed 3 wooden spacers at equal space .before tightening hold down bolts on new style low gpm toilet. reason is i filled space between toilet and tile with RTV to give extra structural support to prevent wobble. i sat to compress wax ring, checked for level and snugged the hold down bolts.  this was at least 10 years ago and there have been no leaks or wobble since.
the home owner used a screw driver he used Shems...
Okay never do this lol. Putting a shim or two under the toilet is one thing but if your floor is THAT bad then you need to bite the bullet and get your floor fixed. Putting THAT many shims is gonna make your floor even worse.
There is a mistake here, he should have put shim on the two side of near the bolt
Just put paris plaster  As long as it's not leaking or is spwing septic odors who cares if the toilet is not level. Unless you want to make it a project that's fine $$$
Hand me one of those cookies. Thanks.
Micky mouse would be so proud
If you wiggle it... the whole floor moves. Maybe that's the problem lol.
Don’t install wood floors in your bathroom
Customer says toilet is rocking and has replaced the wax ring himself attempting to fix it but clearly did not work, so how could a bolt be the culprit when the floor the toilet sits on is sitting on that saggy of a floor? If the bolt was the culprit he wouldn’t have went to the extent of shimming the toilet that high lol rip to that toilet
nice gigantic crack in the toilet you just glossed over
Toilet 3 inches off the ground?.Looks Good he says ...........😂😂😂😂It must be a joke it  can't be real.Leave the screwdriver in looks better like that or order 3 cases of caulking.But actually  he can use all this space underneath the toilet as a storage .LOL
Life long fan but this quality of work shocks me. This is not the quality repair we expect from these guys. The floor issue should have been addressed. At the very least they should have acknowledged how to do the job right.
What a jerry rig!  I can almost guarantee you that the (china - as he says) - ( its actually porcelain) will crack at the base where the screws come up through - or it will crack at one of his shims - the screws are designed to just keep the toilet from moving - the toilet should be sitting firmly on all of the base to be secure!   How about finding the reason that the floor is buckling in the first place, repair the floor, and do it right the first time?  I would be embarrassed to buy and wear any of your This Old House merchandise!
He should of double bolted the closet bolts to instead that little plastic crap then use a real wax ring I would use real wood shims break it off in there
Now we got flexible 1/4 round for that gap.
What if the flange is trashed and the floor is trashed?  Not that I have that going on in my bathroom 😉
1:31 *Floor Flexes like Godzilla is trying to punch through from the bottom*... "I think the bolt is your culprit"
The video thumbnail looked like a fleshlight
Yaaaaaaa Richard! I've been using that Sani Seal green foam wax ring alternative for 4 years now. Glad to see you finally adopted it also. I love it because we can re-use that green foam, sometimes we have to move the toilet a few times during construction to get things done, but put it back same day so people can use it. With wax rings you have to scrape up the mess and put a new one down each time you replace the toilet.
He got some gloves!!!
At least he's started wearing gloves,saw one sponging the toilet, removing the wax ring, no gloves. Living dangerously LoL.
You should have finished the work the right way to seal the gap.
the floor was loose .
I tried this product with listing floor, and LOVE IT!
I didn't care for the shims but he is right I is a much larger repair, but I would of felt more comfortable seeing a shim around the bolt area as well
Looks to me like the real problem is that floor. Shimming the toilet is just a band-aid fix, and one that might crack the toilet.
@0:51 drains toilet with sponge then puts sponge on counter....ew
I had to fix this a few years back at a rental... @4:18, those plastic shims didn't work as the gaps were too much. The toilet was extremely wobbly... Several plumbers tried to fix it and charged big bucks, but eventually, I had to create an custom SINGLE large SHIM/off-set to match the entire shape of the base, as the floor was so non-leveled on all ends, but that fixed/leveled it, and it never wobbled since then... Nice video...
Plumbers charge quite a bit per hour because they work around, poop, pee, food waste, rot, nasty smells, germs of all kinds. The high charge gives them some credibility and status. A "B" license, or General Contractor is the best choice. By the way, that homeowner needed his floor leveled, either by re-framing or jacking and a beam and footings below. More investigation was needed, hence the need for a General Contractor.
Hard time to sleep tonight> seen the shimsssss!
they should of showed the guy using it pissing while sitting down !!!
Thank you how Do you fix floor toilet which may be blocked thank you
For TOH, this looks pretty bad.  A gap more than 1/2 inch?  Fix the damn floor, then reinstall the toilet.  Have to give a thumbs down on this one for Richard T.
wood flooring for a bathroom or kitchen is a no no
Se ve feo, pero resolvió el problema.
The foam gasket is garbage.
Leaves a 3/4 inch gap between the toilet and the floor.
Great video.  Apply tile grout in the gap and it will never rock and yet easy to remove when replacing the bowl.  Caulk will provide a seal but little support for the bowl; especially on an uneven floor.
$1000 to lift up a few boards and reseat  a toliet... You must be a sparky 😂
You should bolt your Johnny bolts to the closet collar. Those plastic holders are crap.
Horrible!  Not even close.
I'd be appreciative of the fix but with OCD,  that gap underneath would drive me batty.
Why didn’t you cut the damaged floor out & replace? It’s obviously damaged and going to sink more - my own floor looked & moved the same. And sinking that much may even be putting stress on the drain pipe underneath. That’s only going to be pvc and you really don’t want the shit-carrying pipe cracked or broken under your toilet!  We ended up cutting out the water-damaged floor section & cutting a much bigger piece of 1/2 inch plywood. For there, I’d go from the cabinet to the wall & all the way back to the back wall, ending the board just in front of the toilet - since the hole is towards the back. Stain to match the existing floor, & treat with water proofer/resistor. Cut a new floor flange hole, reattach floor flange & pipe to new board, and then reinstall toilet.  This may make the toilet set up a 1/2 inch higher, but it took care of the sagging floor & anymore sinking from the water damage. And actually, as you age, if you had a low toilet to begin with, you appreciate that extra 1/2 inch in height that your toilet now sets ;)  An added benefit, is if the toilet leaks again to damage the plywood, you only have to replace the plywood piece you put down & not a whole huge section of expensive wooden floor.
Those foam seal rings are a no-no with level or raised flanges. Notice the toilet doesn't sit down on the floor? Should of used the tried and true wax WITHOUT the middle black rubber funnel ring.
is it just me, or does that homeowner sound an awfull like the TOH electrician?
He was talking into the toilet
When I set a toilet, i trace the outline of the toilet base on the floor. I remove the toilet and mix a batch of plaater if Paris and place it within the lines in rhe floor. Then I set the toilet onto the closet flag ams rock the toilet until its leve amd wait for the plaster to harden. This makes a nice solid base for the toilet on any floor even if is not level. Those shims wont give the toilet good even support
The biggest issues i find from all my clients' toilet repairs are the toilet flanges being loose. He never checked how sturdy the toilet flange is... just because there are screws in the flange doesn't mean that it isn't wiggling. The guy just created a ticking time bomb, even with leveled floors, if the toilet flange moves... its only a matter of time before the seal is pinch through. the uneven floors just made it worst.
LOL Don't ever do the sponge trick. That's only to avoid lil dripping, just keep some shop rags and dont tip the toilet over.
It's not tested until someone drops a duece through it. Any other experts would have to concur or just laugh like hell 😂🤣
Clorox is needed for this counter.
It looks nice? Lol
PL adhesive. Did that 12 years ago and still no wobble 😂
Let's mickey mouse it
ну и халтура, два раза сядет и все соскочит
USE WAX
Wood floors in a bathroom? Wtf.
Flip the closet bolt nut over.  It will act like a tire lug nut and keep the washer centered
I thought that was was poop
With just shims, but no mortar bed to spread the stresses, the base and bowl may now crack. No toilet maker would approve of this kludge, porcelain toilets are still PORCELAIN and uneven stress cracks them.
Dam. how high can I use the shims???
Richard made a mistake in calling the mounting nut a 1/2" nut  when the actual size if the nut is 5/16.  When he uses the wrong terms John Q, Public has a difficult time at the hardware store buying the correct size fastener.  In YouTube there are  many examples of people calling the outside diameter of a nut or bolt head the actual size.
lol...that floor is in bad shape. Better wear a safety harness when using it...😅
does it have to be level? I would've just gone with an unleveled toilet that it actually sits on the darn floor vs jacking it up an inch so that my poop can float evenly. The problem was that he was missing hardware and using a wax ring on a floor that has a lot of movement on it. I would've just gone with that foam ring and proper hardware.
I don't envy anyone doing a 'mind over fecal matter' job. you have my utmost respect.
I hate how they never let the homeowners do the work so they can learn. Some of us are hands on and not book readers
Just about every decent set of bolts comes with two sets of nuts one to lock the bolt to the flange and the other too Bolt the toilet. What he did there by using the plastic washers will create a nightmare down the road for the next person to take the toilet off when they try to turn the nut and the whole Bolt spins instead. I am a service plumber myself and if I saw the floor that bad I would have told the customer that I wouldn't do the job until the floor was fixed. That looks like total crap and would never fly with my boss if he saw me do the job that way.
Whoa  whoa  that's cold water shut off.. Mercy.
Temporary fix gotta fix the issue with the floor eventually, it could be serious.
Should have grouted that toilet to the floor.
Your the man!!! GREAT VIDEO 💪 JUST WHAT I NEEDED. ..THANK YOU
I'm no expert on this matter but those shims can break in the future and that job looks like crap. Look at 6:43. That is terrible. I blame the home owner for not ripping out the wood, leveling the floor and putting in proper bathroom floor tiles. Wood will warp, bend and absorb water. Bathrooms should not be carpeted or have wood floors.
Wouldnt it be funny if the owners turned to that guy and said what about the sub floor old man!  😂
Rumor has it after he left the owner used the toilet water went all over the floor 😂
They should have had Tommy come in to fix the floor!
cheap bastards you could fixed the floor thats the real issue
Horrible job it looks like 2”gap from here a real customer would have complained right away
TOH buy a $3 baster to suck water out of bowl instead of using sponge!
I’d fire my technician if they shimmed a toilet that radical.... that will never last that Bowl will be broken before he can get back to his shop
i would never have wood floors in a bathroom
I have a wobbly toilet but its not the type that uses a wax floor seal. It flushed out back through the wall. I have a tiled floor but what's happened is from constant mopping of the floors some water has made its way under the pan and down through the screw holes and rotted the sub floor so the screws don't bite into anything anymore.  What can I do about this WITHOUT lifting up all the tiles?
Omg did no one see that doobie under the toilet haha!!
Shoulda called Tom.  He would have had that floor leveled using only a hammer and his trusty hand plane.
This must be a joke. Do not do this to fix a wobbly toilet.
as many have noticed there should be a shim where the closet bolt is. similar to when machining a part the first thing you're taught is to put your parallel under where your clamping on the table! Richard is not a bad plumber. i am a little dissapointed about this. the mortar on the shrine is loosening. lol. also leaving that large gap under the toilet will allow water and urine a place to seep down to the lower ceiling. it will also give insects a crawl space...
Lol should tell the owner to tile their bathroom lol nasty see stains under the toilet wood plus toilet is fowl lol
I like how he said the customer to get his tools
I disagree with the statement it is only cosmetic with caulking. Yes, it is cosmetic and also secures shims from moving and it gives support in all the voids. where the china is not touching the floor. I am a professional handyman and have fixed many toilets that were shimed and in time the shims moved and the toiled started to rock again. caulking stops any movements by my experience.
what a terrible install
People in comments are always "experts". I guarantee they told the homeowner the floor needed fixing and had other problems. But the owner said no. And just wanted a quick fix for the toilet.
Replaced the wax seal did ya? Hmmm
man this was a terrible job should at least fixed it right
This seems so half assed to me
patch
Toilet spong on the counter... Ick!!!!
I tried these rings and the appear to be made of foam rubber. In my mind they are junk. They suck up the flush water and start leaking when they become saturated.
Is it me or are the expert guys like riddled with some hidden knowledge.
anyone see the floor flex at 1 minute 30 seconds.  How about fixing the floor instead of putting a band-aid on it
Thats not going to last how pathetic.
"Yeah I changed the wax ring" ... "hmm wow look at this. some idiot ran the nut and mangled this washer. I think thats our culprit" ...
Take those lock washers and Kobe them to the nearest trash can. Use a washer and nut to hold the closet bolts tight to the collar. Then another washer and nut for the toilet. In other words you're double nutting the toilet. Then you can take that green gasket and throw that away too. They're nothing but  a headache. Like everyone else said, this is a job for Silva.
Did anyone else see the whole floor moving when he was moving stool back and forth?
I liked your efforts much. But I don't like this type of toilets
Nice urine, homeowner.  Didn't bother to clean for poor Richard?
Take a look how many video is on YT for fixing US toilet or wax rings and how many video you find European style toilet. No need to wonder that US toilet connection to pipe is ridiculous designed.
Should have filled the gap with plaster of paris. Not only does it fill the gap but also take the pressure point off the shims and distribute equal force on the floor
I love this TV show: but that's not a very professional job .
Betting game: which will shatter first, the shimmed toilet, or the sagging floor?
Good for Rich. He finally discovered that gloves exist.
Plumber here, if I did a job like that for a customer, they would never call me back, can't say I wouldn't blame them.  TOH is getting sloppy!
Horrible job
whenever i install a toilet - im the first one to take a dump
How do you know the floor doesn't need to be replaced since you didn't look at the subfloor? What if the subfloor is rotten?
there's clearly give on the floor. i would have preferred to watch a video on the repair of the floor AND the toilet.
Puts dirty sponge on countertop
I've never seen a bathroom with wood floors.
Ugh. That's terrible. They should've called the carpenter in to fix the floorboard, then bring back the plumber. 2 for 1 segment.
backer rod n white silicone.. easy..
That toilet WILL start wobbling again in about 3 to 4 weeks. That floor needs some massive support because as long as that is not fixed no toilet will ever stay still. At 1:33 you can clearly see the whole floor flexing when he wiggles the toilet. Also, the foam gasket should be a rubber version. If a plumber comes in-house and leaves this as his pride work he could go back to work and fix it the correct way. Shimming a toilet - HEAD SLAP. O and because you lift the toilet that far off the ground on 1 side the seal will not seal. Sewer stench incomming.
They think we wouldn’t notice that the floor was lifting up
I don’t ever use shims. It’s just a bandaid. Fix the floor in this case. In most all other cases of a toilet that wobbles, the flange is too high.
Would have been a really good idea to figure out why the floor was so far out. There could be rot underneath. I don't see why just in that area that a pad couldn't be built from new lumber and stained to match. He did mention it, just don't understand why it wasn't done.
Those foam rings are a big issue now.. if you use any cleaner for the toilet or bleach it will dissolve the foam ring and cause a VERY smelly issue over time..  It doesnt happen overnight but people who remove their toilets a year later due to a musty smell find a ruined subfloor..
the 'two marks on a stick' trick will only work if your container has vertical sides. otherwise, you get more of the second ingredient.
my guess is that a plumber butchered the joists in order to run his pipes. now another plumber tries to fix his mistakes. would probably be better to open the ceiling below and jack the floor up to sister on some new joists. should have sent Tommy!
This was a mess
Lipstick on a pig.
dont hire your neighbor
How about fixing the dam floor first. Do it right or don't do it at all.
At last, Richards wearing gloves. I would of placed the level on the bowl or seat itself, not the tank lid...That large gap is unsanitary, needs addressing ASAP
So much crap is going to get lodged under that gap.  A full surround shim would likely help with this.
They should have sent Tommy there first..
Your floor is hoopajooped, call a GC. :)
4:44 Holy Cow time to fix the foundation on that house!
If he was working for a plumbing company he was supposed to upsell and sold a complete new bathroom.  It should be gutted and fixed properly. Upsell, upsell, upsell. Also should have just filled gap with plaster of paris to make it look better. No customer would accept you leaving it looking that way.
I'm just a little concerned that the floor sagging wasn't fixed which is the main reason the toilet is tipping over. Also, no shim near the flange bolt means this toilet will crack and break off at the bolt area. TOH used to be a great way to learn how to fix this properly not mickey mouse them and walk away. Sad.
Just my opinion
Put plaster of Paris under the toilet will give you the height and a clean look
If you shim a toilet like that it can create pressure points and crack. Don't do it
Why didn't they put plaster Paris on the toilet an old plumbus trick
Wouldn’t anyone be worried why it happened to the floor?
Fifteenth Comment
drains toilet with sponge then puts sponge on counter....ew
This was a job for Tommy.
What do you do if there's a large poo in the toilet?
I think TOH has a toilet obsession. 30% of their videos is about it.
Why do i wear gloves I can never figure it out.
Clean around your toilet dirtbag
