HELP please 🙏🏾  Hi Taste Pink. I’m trying to get this style for vacation in a few weeks but my stylist is struggling to find the Janet kinky twist hair you used.  Can you suggest another brand that will achieve that same nice puffy  look?    Thanks

Absolutely beautiful style..I can't wait to do mine now 👍👍❤
Hey there 😁👋🏽 how long can you keep this in without it getting tangled? I'm concerned about the rubber bands bursting up my hair 😭
Still rock Withcha in 2020.
Is it heavy?
If I do this cute style I wanna add some railroad tracks design too it make it jazzy 🙂😉

You look like thanie newton
Absolutely Beautiful ♥️ if I had 5 thumbs they'd all be up! Thanks for sharing
I'm doing this on me and my girls hair❤️❤️❤️
This is so beautiful.
Beautiful! Never seen this brand of hair in my area.
Yes!!! Easy peasy I've GOT to try this style.
I just did this exact style and I am loving it! The rubberband method made it so much easier! Thank you so much for the idea and tutorial!!
I love this!!😍😍
U look like Kelis in 1st vid sooo pretty i love this style ya make up ya face lol u just gone head then my sista ❤
😍
It's not just that you show how to make the style, but you give ideas on what ways to wear it so people can see for themselves how versatile the hairstyle is.  Thank you, you're a professional!
Gorgeous! <3
Cute gorgeous af!!!! I loveeeee these styles I will be doing this tonight😂😍💓
Hot Damn girl... and that eye makeup at the end!!!! FIRE!!!
I was wondering if anyone can tell me, if when doing this style do you have twist tightly?
This is so great! Thank you for putting all of the information in the description box! I saved this to my Hair playlist! :)
I tried this out but I braided the root. Today I’m going to redo them and I’m gonna try to the crochet method because twist from the root makes a difference in the look. No matter how many times I watched this video and how simple it should be I am not getting the split and band the way you did it 😩🤦🏾‍♀️
How long did this style last and what was your nighttime routine?
What length was this hair?
I love this style! I'm doing this next week can't wait..you make it look so easy...tfs!
How many packs of hair did you use?
Is there a high chance of breakage where the rubberbands are?  How long do you suggest this style should be left in? How hard was it to remove?  I love this style so much and you look amazing. I want to try this but as you can tell I have a lot of questions. LOL
Just finished mines. I just struggle with parting. Your parts looks way better than mines. I used to Cuban Kinky hair.  Thanks for the inspiration. Great job!
This is amazing and I want to give it a try. You're ending was so dope! Thank you for this!
OMG, you are the first stylist that I have seen who applies the rubber band like that. Thanks for sharing!
Love it
How can I stop my hair from unravelling after I get done twisting it???
This is beautiful! Gonna try this. Thank you!!!
Thank you
Absolutely gorgeous... U & ur twists!!!!
That is beautiful
How Did You End Up Parting The Top Of Your Head I Was Following You Untill The Top
Girl, I'm late but I'm here LOL💕 I'm a lazy person when it comes to my hair and this is perfect for me❤❤ great job thanks for sharing
LIFE!!!!!!!!♥️♥️😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the easiest video ive seen. I was needing something easy to do to my hair before I gave birth. This was a game changer! Thank you!
So gorgeous 🏆🍯👸🏽😫😫😫🔥🔥
YES YES YAAAS...LOVE THIS LOVE THIS LUUUUUUV THIS GIRL!!!! Def gonna try it!!!!
Thinking of doing this over my locs
I AM 2 YEARS NATURAL. I'M 59 YRS BEAUTIFUL. DAUGHTER, YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME SOMETHING NEW, FRESH & OH SO FABULOUS!!! I'M ROCKING THE UP-DO TO CHURCH SUNDAY. THANK YOU, SO MUCH! I CAN DO MY DAUGHTERS HAIR AS WELL!💖💖💖👑👑💖💖💖

Hello, Beautiful! How long does this style last?
This a great protective style for us natural queens !👸🏾😍
I'm doing this!  I love your videos!
OMG I LUFF IT SOOOO MUCHHHH
Girrrrrrrrlll you got me thinking I do my own hair lol!!! I love this look!!
Crazy great! My daughter's off to Greece soon and I want to make sure the   Her twists will last even if she swims. Rubber bands!! Yeah!, thanks a million.
Very nice 👍🏼
Sooooo pretty 💯love and light sis 💜💙
I will be trying this. I love the way u put the hair and the rubber band it. Thanx for sharing 🥰🥰🥰
Thank you for this!! I did this style after seeing this. Wore it today 8/9/19 and already got compliments. What do u wear on your head to sleep with these braids?
yOUR MAKEUP THOUGH....lOVEEEEEE!!!
You did a great job, I especially liked the hair up.  Your make up is giving me life also.  Beautiful!
So pretty ☺️😍
I wanna try this. I might be able to hamdle it. I know you make the styles look easy. Beautiful looks. I do like updo's.
How did you ensure you rubber band didn’t slide when you started twisting? Mines keep sliding from the roots when I twist.
I’m definitely trying all styles 🙏👏🏼😎💕💕💕
This shit is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Excellent Video!  I will try this style out today!  Thanks for making this video so easy for me.  You have help save me money for not going to the salon and paying someone $100 for this style and plus it wasn't including the hair.  My questions to you is how do you get your parts so neat?  Do you use a mirror to see the back of your head?  Thanks in advance!
Pretty
So lovely dear👍
Wow
Very BEAUTIFUL!!
What was your nightcare routine?
Sooo cute
I have a short cut but love to watch tuts!! This was dope and provides less tension on the hair!! Great job!!
Doing this for PRIDE CHICAGO!
Great Video!  Made it easy for me to start doing my own twists!
😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sis what is that gold on your hand im loving it, and I want it. If possible
Yaaas, I'm late but I've got so many natural hairstyle ideas for the remaining year. This may be my 25th birthday hairstyle!
Beautiful Queen!
That frontal pony tail tho❤❤❤
Can’t see your parts 🙄
Edge up would help a lil
I love it girl. Your tutorial was on point. It really helped me. I tried this and it came out pretty good. My only problem is that my own hair tried to escape from the other hair. Like it kept sticking out if my braid. Still trying to get that part down. ❤️💓
Yes! I'm doing protective styling for All of 2019 mainly crochet, wigs, braids. I plan to try this style.❤
Absolutely beautiful!!!
Oh my gosh so easy and beautiful ❤️
Ummmm.....makeup tutorial please??? ❤
Does anyone know how many packs she used ?
I love it I'm doing my hair like this today 😍
yes yes! this is my signature hairstle but you took it to another level. love being a black woman and all the amazing things our hair can do!. spring/summer 2019 here i come :)
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Definitely LOVED the last style 😍 Attempting this tmrw✌️
I love your videos and the way you break down each step and.product used.  Thank you
I love it.  My favorite styles are one & two. I've learned so much on how to nurture mt natural hair. I look forward to your videos.
👑🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely beautiful.
Love the style about how many twists is this?
Oh my goodness. You have just made my year or century... This is by far the easiest way I've seen anyone do twist braids in their hair. I wish I could send you something just for this video.😮 I'm in shock and I love this. Great job. I have several packs of afro kinky braids, but it's so thick and my hair is also very thick that it's hard sometimes to get the twist flowing and by the time I apply 2 I take it out.
That updo was everything
Style 2 an 3 are the ones I'll definitely try especially 3 I love big hair an pony tails thanks doll
Omg i am going to do this style tonight using your method. Thanks girl. I didn’t know what to do with my hair anymore. Some how i ended up catching lice and i cut all my hair off 🤦🏽‍♀️ i have enough to be able to do this style so i want to say thanks for helping me get off the couch and stop moping
Sis, this is the content that I subscribed for! I absolutely love her videos! This was so simple and easy to follow I definitely have to do this style. I'm trying all of this.
Tnx 💛my daughter just did these for me
How long does this take to do ?
Omggggggg I love this hair style
Am doing this today thank u girl
oh ok...so we just gon' start looking like goddesses now...
I'm gonna try all.. Look is so lit!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍
Loved this tutorial. I be needin some protective styles for my natural hair.
This is exactly what I was looking for. Not too small and easy to spruce up after gym sessions. Plan to use some leftover spring twists to see the effect first but will make them just as chunky
So different n cute!
Absolutely all
I just love this style.
I'm definitely gonna try this yesss I absolutely love it
You are awesome girl!!!😍🙌🏾
Love the Hawk .. Did the rubber band method due to twa and crochet hair under the rubber band and love it. Gonna rock that Hawk ❣️
GIRL YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, YOU JUST HELPED A OLD LADY OUT..I'M LOVING THAT STYLE AND I'M GOING TO BE WEARING IT😉.. SUBSCRIBER FOR LIFE ..YOU KEEP DOING YOUR THING GIRL..smooches😘
Thank you for making a video sponsoring that hair brand
Yo, with makeup on, you remind me of Angela Simmons, Rev Run’s daughter. I think y’all even have similar voices.   Cute, exotic, African tribal hairstyles. I’m copying them! 👍
I would wear this style year around
I love your videos 😊very Nice!!
Love the tutorial and your voice so soothing.
Chile this is beautiful, ur beautiful. I love this style. Im a college student so being able to do this myself is a great help
Thanks! Was getting sick of braids!
Okay, this style is really beautiful and definitely beginner friendly, but I found myself having to retwist the ends really, really frequently. Any suggestions for ways to avoid that?
Hi this is beautiful. Is this heavy?
❤️
I bet you fine as hell.....im just saying
Thank you! This tutorial gives me confidence to try it.
Beautiful... how long did you leave them in using this method?
I love love love this style ooookay hunty

Thanks again for this hairstyle. i did it for my birthday which is coming up ( 30th sep). i attempted it without the rubberband also.
Loved the style, but that makeup was beautiful.
cute!!! I am going to do this.
Love the side pony & mohawk..going to get some hair now!!!! Thanks Diva!!##
love love love! thank you
Damn you took the hairstyle look to a whole new level with the makeup!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is my first video of yours I'm watching and I'm subbing immediately 💛
Is there any reason that you secure the rubber band after the Marley hair is in place instead of making the ponytail and using the crochet hook to pull the Marley hair through? Does it create more tension on the natural hair or something?
Good job. I love it
I watched your video and received so many compliments on this look. 😍😍😍
Hey I 😍😍😍😍😍 this video. I'm doing my hair there exactly same way, but a little smaller. I like all of them but I would rock the 1st one, then the 3nd one, and lastly the 2nd one. Thank u for the ideas.
love the mohawk
Girrrrl....
Great tutorial... 🤔See i  had  a similar  type of technique ..because i suck at twisting 😂😂.. . plaiting down the section a little then crochet the hair thur then twist 😉

Slayyyed.....How on earth did this get ANY thumbs down? Lol people crazy.
How many packs of hair ?
Love the video, so professional!
I absolutely loved this video, beautiful! Well done. Your commentary was so engaging.
OMG too GOREGOUS! THANK YOU FOR THIS TUTORIAL.
Thank you for uploading! This video was very in-depth and informative! These are exactly what I am going for!
Girl you look absolutely stunning! I am attempting this style now. Thanks for the tutorial  and pray for me lol
You Good✔I ❤this you are SO PRETTY.. afro kinky twist hair ..  question about the rubber bands? do they break the hair...   you did a gr8 job... I'm in ❤ w/ your style⚢
Just finished my hair doing your methods and I must say.... IT CAME OUT BEAUTIFUL 😍😍 😍😍 😍 THANK YOU FOR THE VIDEO!!! Definitely beginner friendly 😁  PS: I'm 38 weeks pregnant today and I needed to do this before giving birth to my daughter 😊
Wow! This was so pretty! I love all the styles. I use the same rubber band method. But you just taught me how to part my hair at an angle and then place the extensions. I was parting either vertical or horizontal 🤗 I look forward to trying chunky twists and giving these styles a try. Thanks for sharing!
Beautiful You❤. You remind me of Angela Simmons
I love it and that updo if life ❤️❤️❤️❤️
💜💜💜
Number 3😍😍😍
I have never seen it done this way, and it's a great way and the rubber band is not directly on the roots. Love it triple likes for you
How do you feel about this style in a office setting? With less sisters in office than most? Love you and all you do and share with us, dear heart 🌻❤️
Thank you for this tutorial. When my daughter asked me if I wanted some Havana twists I said yes and immediately saw myself rocking the mess out of that Mohawk look. While I liked them all I'm going to go with the Mohawk.
Did you use all 5 packs?
wow, thats so cute
so cute!😍
I finally decided to do this style. Oh, I love the end results! I used a different Noir type of hair but the end results are priceless. I will never pay someone to do this style again.
I like the last style i will try this on my trip next week
can you give me a tutorial on your make up !! I was so focused on looking at the perfect details of your shadow blend and how it compliments your defined wings and highlight so perfectly oh my gosh i’m in love with it!
Tried these twists. Absolutely love them. Very easy. Turned out great for my first attempt at twists. Thanks a bunch 👍🏾
😻😻😻😻 lord
**runs screaming too the hair store**
Thanks so much for this tutorial! This is awesome!=)♡♡♡
You just saved my hairs life thank you for this tutorial
I have a question, how would that beginning method work with doing box braids???
Has anyone tried this? How secure is it? I'm going on a trip and I'd like to avoid a malfunction lol
I cant get my hair to blend with them..  Mine turned out terrible.. Any suggestions... my hair keeps unraveling out of the twist!!
Gawtttdamn,transformed!!
Omgaaaah,i’ve never seen her w/o the makeup&hair done. I just look @ the thumbnail&the finished look. Wowwwwwww
🤔
Very pretty and easy! Thanks girl!❤️
Love this!!!!!!! Thanks girl..
Very pretty! I like them all
This is spot on. I am a beginner and can barely do hair but this was so simple and easy to follow. I watched this video yesterday and did the hair style the next day. It doesn't take long at all. I did this style since I am going camping and didn't want to bother with my hair.   Thanks for the easy yet stylish and beautiful tutorial!!!🤩🤩
I know this is a hair tutorial but we can’t just pass up on this makeup look tho! Stunning

Great tutorial.
I’m tryna figure out why this tutorial has 231 dislikes 🤔 I love this, you’re definitely underrated!
Amazing! I have hope now that I can do it
Oh my I've been in love with these forever. Came across your tutorial and have done them twice since then. Thank you and they are so easy to do.
Love this one! Getting ready to try it in a few days. Come on through with the makeup tutorial though!!! Please and thank you.
Now that’s something I can comprehend thank you
Wowwww... I did do the Havana twist using the invisible method for the first tym ever but looking at your method with the rubber band, it looks super easy so I'm def going to try it on my daughters hair. Tnx love
I am definitely a beginner and I am trying to learn new wage to secure the hair in so I won't keep having slip outs. And this looks so good on you. Makeup is also gorg!
Thank you. This is exactly what I was looking for. Never seen it done this way before where you split your hair and put the kinky hair in the middle with the rubber band. 👍🏾👍🏾
I'M getting my life with these styles yeees😊😊
Oh I’m trying this. She’s giving me all types of life right now 😍😍🔥
OMG GIRL, YOU DID THAT!!! Absolutely beautiful! Attempting this look... make up and all lol Thanks for sharing!!! 💕💕💕
How many twists is this?
Love it
do you think this same rubber band technique would work for jumbo braids?
how long did you have these in... they look beautiful
I love it! The makeup & hair ribbons really made that pop! I'm doing this today!
At nineteen seconds I liked it
I truly love you and I will be in the house doing this hair style asap. I love all the creative hair styles you've done. Thank you.
How long did it take you I want to try this!
Absolutely loved this video!! And thanks for all the details!!!!! I'm going to try this before I go to work haha
Gorgeous, Dahling! You and this tutorial!
I have super soft hair and it’s butt length. I do my Marley twists myself bc they tend to slip after just a couple days and that’s not worth the money. Someone suggested using rubber bands but I was worried about breakage. Your method seams soooooo much safer! I cant wait to try it.
Girrrrl....luuv this!! I will definitely try this.
How many packs of hair ?
YAASSS boo... I love love it... You are amazing.... You give my hair dos life...
THANKS I'M GOING TO TRY IT... YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL 🌹

Flawless💜💜💜💜
Even though the hair is being twisted the wrong direction it’s a detailed tutorial
Since my taper cut is growing out, my edges are still short. I originally thought of using the rubber band method and crocheting the marley hair through. I never thought to do this! Thank you so much.
Yup. Doing it.
Omg! I love this tutorial! It's beautiful! I am definitely trying this look. BEAUTIFUL, SIMPLE AND SEAMLESSLY ELEGANT 💋
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I tried it and I achieve it !!!I got so many compliments ppl keep asking if that's my real hair lol and some ask me why I moved it when I took it out lol
Hi!!! I'm completely obsessed with this look!!! I'm actually about to start it and realized I only have 4 packs!!! Should I go get another.. Or should I be ok?
You just saved my life. Thanks cant wait to try.
Is there anyway the rubber bands can be avoided?? I just know they cause hella breakage 😩
I love this style!!!! I wii be trying this! 👍👍
I'm dying to know how long this protective lasted?
wow.. im so glad that i clicked this video. im going to do my daughter hair like this.... its so cute
Love love love this tutorial. Thank you I will try it tomorrow ☺❤
Your updo's r it Giiiiiiirllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!! K:D
Where can I  buy the lulu's hair and scalp astringent. Love this video.
Best tutorialEVER!!!
Wow!
Where'd you get the earrings though??????
YASSSS! Love this look! And he fact it seems sooo easy!
I did this style last night on my head.  It was difficult for me at first because I couldn't hide the rubber band. However after I got into the rhythm of it,  it was pretty simple. I also used The same hair accessories.  The rubber bands hurt my head though.  I have naturally fine hair,  so I had to double the rubber band,  so sleeping really sucked...lol. but it'll be fine once it loosens.  My go-to style will definitely be the high pony. Overall,  I love this style.  Thank you for sharing.
Amazing!
Trying this tomorrow. I need prayer lol
I just love the way u style your hair  Will  see if this  hair can be purchased in my country.
@tastePink I'm so in love & inspired to start doing my own hair again! Thank you!!!
LOVE this tutorial!! Thank you for sharing!! Will be trying this but with super bold colors! Wish me luck!
You look like African Princess 👑
Can you do a take down video please.....I low key don't trust that the elastic band won't break my hair.
How is it with working out?
Im going to try this and I have never done a protective style on myself with extensions.

I'm so glad I found this video! I did a google search and saw this thumbnail picture  and looked for a stylist to do this, but they are charging so much so I googled the picture again to get a better look because I'm just going to do the style myself but thank God this time I also found the video!
How many packs of hair did you use????
I just love everything about this video! Beautiful styles and very pretty girl! 👏🏽
Oh man this style waa such a big hit. I've had it in for about 3 weeks now and it so beginner friendly and such an easy style to manage. I love it so much I'm doing it again this weekend 😉😍. Thanks for such a great tutorial
This is the best video for this style on YouTube! I've watched a few but yours is the best. Thank you. I'll be trying this tomorrow.
Love the style! Quick question: how do you take these down without your hair breaking? Since rubber band is being used
You killed this sis makeup and all
How long do they last?
Omg I loved this !!!!! I’m going to try it I’ll tag you on IG lol
Love it 😍
Its really the make up look thats s-alayinngg
Thank you so much for posting this tutorial. I just did this with my hair a few days ago and it is so nice. Thank you for the styles as well,  I love this ❤️.
Omg!! Oh my goddess! 😜 this is so easy to do nd beautiful..my boyfriend been wanting me to get this style long ago..now imah surprise him nd do it..thanks for your tutorial...any makeup tutorials? Lashes? Im a subscriber💖👑✊💜🔥
I love how you styled your hair, very pretty!
Look for the House of Bubble Gum, its time to Close Up...Nicki Minaj finally left NYC...
Hair is gorgeous!! But what eyeshadow is that?
I can’t find this Hair at any local beauty supply stores
I had to subscribe after seeing this vid 🙌🏼😍
love it
you know..i'm DYING to try this style, but I must say, i'm a little nervous of rubber bands.  I mean...won't the bands break off your hair? What if i'm sleeping and moving my head in bed?  Will it cause the bands to pull my hair out?  I'm too nervous.
yess
I just love this hairstyle. I tried it last night and I'm loving it!!! I'm going to be rocking this simple yet fleeky style for awhile!!! Thanks love Pink. BTW the Mohawk and updo are my favorite styles. Xoxo
Omg!! I'm going to try this. Love the up do!
Thank you for this video. I just did my hair like that of course it's not that perfect lol for a short vacation. I get a lot of compliments thanks to you ♡♡♡
I tried this style and it did not turn out at all
Lol 1 month later I'm finally heading out to buy the product. Ty again
Yessss thanks so much for the rubber band tip!
That one
I would love to have my hair done for the winter
Hi there. Had a question. I have pretty short Afro so will I be able to do this style???
To get my natural hair to match the texture I blow dried my hair on low cool and did the stretch method.... If I'd blown it out all the way my hair would be too straight
I. CAN'T. WAIT. TO. TRY. THIS! I could never get the original method for marley twists so the rubbers would make it soooo much easier. Thanks for this :)
ooooooooooo perfect.
I love the last 2
Im trying it today will let you know
This will be my fall look🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁thank you so so much for this video😙😙😙😙😙😙😙im so excited now to do it...I hope it turns out great like yours😇😇😇😇
I am doing this style while watching this Tutorial step by step. Thank you so much for this!
Invisible roots method made easy, THANK YOU 🙌🏾
Lv it!!! Hi sweetie I don't know if u answered this question...I went through the comment and didn't see if anyone asked u...but how many packs of kinky hair did u use? Thanks so kindly
Yes finally a method that solves all of my problems in one. Thank you!
Newbe !  Loving what I see and Yes to what everybody has said on here, Loving this style and the stylist Much ! Girl you know I am  going to Rock ( oops! do they still say that? ) this style,  lol  Anyway I am going to my nearest  hair store ASAP ! Now question how  many packs of hair for this style, because I notice you use 6 strains for each ponytail?  Please do get back ...anybody?
Hi, love what you did here and you are beautiful! how many braids do you have in your hair? Thanks.
How many packs of hair did you use for this whole style and where can we find the gold thread? :)
I'm not often wowed by tutorials but this rubber band technique just gave me the courage to do this style without wording if it'll slip out! Thank you'
...this might be a dumb question but do the rubber bands make your hair break? I've been told that you shouldn't put rubber bands in hair because it breaks it break more?
OHMYGOODNESS!!!!! I LOVE THIS VIDEO. YOU ARE TRULY A BLESSING TO PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH SHORT NATURAL HAIR.  YOU MADE THIS STYLE SO EASY FOR SHORT HAIRED WOMEN SUCH AS MYSELF.
This is my first time seeing with the rubber band method and I love it! Def going to try !!!
Tried it and I Loooooooove it!
I love ur hair and the music!
all 3 gorgeous
Can you tell us where you got the gold thread?
that is sooooo beautiful on you
I think I want these.:^)
The Mohawk
I am so trying this this weekend. The rubber bands...#genius
GORGEOUS😍😍
did you use less than 6 pieces of Marley hair on the ones in the middle of your head? It doesn't look like 6.
love it  i will e trying as my back to school style
that looks really cute 👌
Thank you so much! My birthday is coming up and I didn't know what to do to my hair! I love you rn! ❤❤❤❤😭😭😭
I tried this style with different color hair. It does not look as good. So I'm going to put brown rinse in my hair and use the brown ombre hair I have with maybe blonde since by hair is blonde on the front. Also I will use smaller party's because my hair is a little thicker. I am OCD about hair parting and my hair didn't last down as smooth near the root when I used the rubber bands. It was quick and I love that.
thank you 😭😭😭😭 lord knows i was struggling with those tiny braids
How many twists/sections did you have?
You did that
Wow!  I can't part my hair that good but the rubber band method seems so simple.  I thought the Havana twists were so hard to learn,  but u broke that right on down & I'm on it now. Yess Honey!  Nice job! 😘
I love being black!!!!! Thank you so much for this!
Simply beautiful💗.  Oh! Where did you purchase the gold thread?
I watch this video more than once, making sure I ace this method on my hair. It's look so easy and fast,  I'm glad that I pulled up on your channel for a easy hairstyle. Can't wait to try it!!
Yass honey yasss! Im doing my hair like this today
Number three was my fav. Sexy look
Cool!
Trying these tonight! Pray for me lol. My parting skills need a blessing.  Lol.  Does my hair have to be dry to do this?
AWESOME VIDEO!!!! I WILL BE TRYING THIS SOON!!!!!
Hi liked the tutorial but not the styles of wearing the twist.   I think  this hair style does suit you.
Hi beautiful, I did this a couple weeks ago and it was very pretty. I had to take it out because I did the rubber bands to tight even though i tried to make them loose. any suggestions on making sure the rubber bands don't get to tight
How many twist did you put in each row?
Gorgeous !
I tried this style and it was so easy to install and so gorgeous! Thank you for the great tutorial. You gained a new subie!
Where did you get the thread is beautiful
I tried this style.  Couldn't figure out how to keep my hair from coming out of the twist.
Nice it came out really nice  and also your hair is growing  xo Daisy

How long did this style last for you?
Luv your tutorials
Awesome thanks.
just tried this style , it came out so pretty. I even got a couple compliments...thanks for sharing your ideas..
How long did you keep this style? I know folks are trying to get more content on here, tjerefore people don't really keep styles in that long. I assume it would still look grrat without a touch up after 2 weeks but 3 may be pushing it. It looks great! I had no idea wjat style I was going to do for my bday...now I do!
Great video! Did the rubber bands pull out your hair when you came to remove them?
Attempted this look....ima need practice. Came out nothing like the video
I love it
This hairstyle is to die for
Thanks for the video you make it much simpler even as a normal braid
I think I'm gonna do this style over and over for a year! It's freaking bomb! Budget friendly ✅ Easy to do ✅ can last 4-6weeks ✅ scalp accessible ✅ new mom friendly✅ protective style ✅ slayage ✅ GREAT VID! Thanks for the details!
Omg I will never do regular twist any more I love your rubber band method!!! :-)
yes! a style I can do with confidence lol.    My fall/winter 🤗  Thank you
Girl! You are beautiful! I love this style on you. I'm trying this out for vacation but I'm wondering how I can rock my head wraps with this style. I have a few head warps and matching kimonos. I'm going to try it anyways.. i love this look! Mexico ain't ready!...lol
GIRL I AM SHOOK.
How did you get 20? How many on each row? 2,3, then 4 right? That's 9 so you have 11 left for the top and that's not even 😕. (Sorry I'm a tad bit OCD)
Looks like african boho style 😍😍💟💟
Omg....💘
Love it back to school hairstyle for me 💞💞

Can't wait to try it out i live for the styles you represented
Love watching your videos.  Sound like that good friend who always had your back and keeps it real...
I think I am officially in love with you! First, I found this tutorial online while I was at work. I've been having problems with my speakers so I wasn't able to hear it only watch it. That alone was enough for me I was in love with the style and the ease! So, I told myself as soon as I leave work I am going to go and get some hair. When I got in my car I said let me listen again so I can actually hear it this time. so I pulled it up on my phone and the very first thing that struck me was the soundtrack being by Masego! And then, senorita on top of that! My favorite song! if I thought that in itself wasn't enough for you to be my most favorite person in the world, I subscribed to your page and found out that you two are a weight loss person! I went from 268 to 155. All natural no surgery. So I know your struggle. you are awesome
Love this look!  Can I have these songs though?! Lol
I'm trying this this weekend so finna wear my hair like this for my video shoot 😎
how many rows are on the back section?
This is going to be my next style! I love all the looks and your tutorial was on point, Thanx! New Subbie
Omg I'm in love, I just subscribed! I wish I saw this before I cut my fro off. Now I'll just wait for it to grow back so I can try this goddess look. This is the kind of hair channel I needed in my life 😍
Super Super Cute, can't wait to do my hair. I like the Mohawk

Looooove these. I just need them to be longer.
This omg
How many pack of hair did u use?
this is pretty but idk if i have the patience for trying this
So cute!!!!!! Fast and easy. And every style is my favorite.
I love💚💚💚💚💚 the simplicity of this style I'm doing this today!! just beautiful⚘
I tried to do this to my hair last night and it was not as simple as I thought it would be. My hair is a tad thicker, and getting my nape to look taught and neat was a struggle. It just looked like a poofy mess. I got two twists in before I decided that this would have to wait for a day when I have more time.
Soooo gorgeous!!! This look is absolutely beautiful on you!!!! I love love love it
I love this look! Really want to try but I'm mixed what type of hair would you recommend I've never added additional hair to mine before let alone have ever taken the time to do my natural hair...
Taste girl you did it again all is my favorite

Oh my goodness. this style is BEAUTIFUL.... I freakin love it, and i love you for sharing sweetie.
Could you just put the rubber band in your hair first then crochet the Janet in between  to do the twist?

Can't wait to try this style!
Ingenious!
Did this style last night.... I love it. Had difficulties at first getting the rubber band close to the scalp. By my 3rd twist I was a pro. I normally do the invisible root method.... love this so much more. Very cute outcome.
GURL .. I WILL BE TRYING  THIS..... THANK YOU
Why am I so worried about rubber bands breaking my hair?
I loved all of the styles!
thank you for adding the styles in the end. I  hate stationary hair.
I loved this look on Instagram!

Yass queen...this look is right up my alley. U look so regal. 3 snaps in a circle for this👑
Absolutely stunning!
Not only I live for watching you create beautiful styles 😍. I love the music it all just keeps me watching lol.  What song is this?

Just found my next protective style except I'm going to use kanekalon hair because that's what I have on hand.  I must say you have a baby face, but as soon as you put on makeup it's like sasha fierce....go ahead girl!!!
💜Black Girl Majic💜
luv THIS
how many bags of hair to use?
very nice video very pretty. Rubber bands don't they pull your hair out little by little? Is it better to use the someone plastic rubber bands that they have out now?
where'd you get the hair accessories & what are they called ?
love it
Stunning video. Thanks for sharing. I loved your twists and the hold thread is a nice touch👍
I would wear all Of them love the hair styles
Absolutely love!
Came for the slay and slay I did receive! Gorgeous!!!!!
I literally just watch this video like five times. seriously. I am going to do this style. I am not sure when but it will be real soon. I CANNOT WAIT! your make up is just A1. amazing and I know I am so weird but your voice is relaxing. lol
I am soooo in love with this hairstyle!!!
I just put in some braids a week ago and I'm already - Ready to take it down and do something different. I'm def. going to try this love bug. thank you so SO SO SO MUCH. I WILL DEF. DP THIS HAIR STYLE.
I am totally doing this hair style this year. thank you so much love.
love the rubber band technique! I've never seen it before and i think it is a great method to use. However, I am interested to know what happens if the rubber band snaps? Will the hair still hold up? I like wearing my protective styles for an extended time so I often wash my twists. I just imagine after a few washes, the rubberbands will wear out.
I love it but where I work it won't fit under my hair net for sure
Beautiful
I wanna do this... I will do it.... Thank you.
I love it! is it heavy?
THIS LOOKS GOOD ON YOU  YOU MAKE IT LOOK VERY SIMPLE THANKS FOR EXPLAINING VERY WELL I REALLY LOVE THIS SOOOO MUCH I'M GOING TO TRY THIS! !!!!
You always got the jams on deck!! 👌
quick question: whenever you did the split with the rubber bands, how did you get the split in your hair to be no longer visible?
Girl this hair is everything! I'm a rock this out the remainder of the summer.
I will be trying this. Simple and easy.
Had to click on this because you look absolutely stunning!!!!😍😍 The way you styled you hair to the makeup.. Just amazing!!
Yasss come thru😍😍😍love them all
Girl I loooooove it
Yes this style just have me life. Can't wait to try this. I just took out my faux locs and needed a new hair idea. Thank!!
I want to try this with regular kanekalon hair. I have a ton in my closet. I'm wondering if I can get the same effect? 🤔
So beautiful.  How long did this take you to do?
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! 😍
Loved the  ponytail!
This is so cute. I think this is my vacation  birthday hair style. I also am very confident i can pull this off myself without asking one my sisters to help me.  Thanx for the idea
This is BOMB QU33N!! I love that it beginner friendly!! I will try this on me then I will teach my daughters
You are the best you tuber ever. This style is so beautiful , Royal and sheek just like you..
Loovvvveeeee it!
Beautifully designed and decorated. Well done. Love the makeup too. How many packs of hair did you use?
I am going to try this asap. Great video. I was always told rubber bands break your hair off. Was anyone else under that impression? I know if it were true for you, you wouldn't be doing it. I wonder if it's only true for relaxed hair. I'm natural now so I may not have anything to worry about.
I lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve this. I'm so doing this this weekend
Awesome explanation! So articulately spoken and informative! - Now I have to go look for Gold thread!!!
I love the mohawk but they all look lovely.
Been watching ur channel for years now and I swear you be seriously slaying hair. Keep it coming boo!
I LOVE this method!! Will definitely be trying this on my sister. she has WAY too much hair, lol, so we usually just put it away. She will LOVE this. The first style was my favorite!

I loved this video. Slaying is the standard here. I loved the mohawk. I must say that the Janet Noir is my favourite marley hair I've used so far. The twists weren't too heavy were they?
