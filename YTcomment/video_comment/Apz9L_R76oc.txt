Yes, I know the drill isn't the greatest. Watch 3:41. Cheers
Use a hex shanked one, it doesn't slip as easily.
poor worker
It's not painful if you use a good working tool.  Why make a video like this?
If the drill keeps stalling like that let it build rpm with no pressure or even not touching the metal then slowly apply pressure
thanks, jobs a goodin
Hi! Is this cone drill only suitable for soft metals like in the video? Ty
Πέταξε την μαλακία που έχεις για δραπανοκατσάβιδο
Terrible demo
Get a better drill for christ sake!
What is that? A battery powered drilldo! Get something with some nut.
You know those oddly satisfying videos? This is not one of them... ^^
Exactly why I only been using a plug-in Drill all my life....
You should use a cutting oil with that bit. A new drill too.
Not the best piece of tutelage.
Not helpful at all. Stop improvising and go pro ...
Never meant to be used for that sort of material
Careful, that drills power can break you wrist.
These kind of drill bits are basically non existant in main land Europe.. I've never saw one in a hardware store.
Hey Mate,  ur step drill isn’t powerful enough
After drilling did you treat the new hole with any kind of paint or rust protection products?
need more powerful drill...
British people are so polite garcias. For the video very informotivo
RIP Drill
Hey lads. Lay a rag soaked with lube over the step drill  and get drilling ..keep it lubed👍
Same bit with spiral one. For this kind of job use drill machines with variable speed or cordless drills with high torque.
looks like you need a new cordless drill
nicely done dino!!! I like zane use a bit of soap to help with the friction. Cheers man!
I'm banned by Mrs BrewBear from using drills......maybe on a hangout I can tell you about it one day! HHB Dino👍🍻
Those jandals and socks - what a legend! Thanks Dino, good wee video mate :)
Great job Dino, this kind of tuition is great for all types of applications, as one of your commenters put I prefer a hole saw too but it's the end result that matters,  Cheers mate, thanks for sharing, 🍻😀👍,
Cant beat power tools and brewing.  love the safety gear chap. much akin to the Scottish attitude might I say. cheers
Handy tool got to get me a set for the kegs. Cheers
Glad to see you got it all squared away with no leaks, Dino. Have you considered using themal grease for a more accurate temperature reading? "Kiwi safety boots!" Lmao! I got quite a chuckle out of that. Cheers! 🍻
Nice one mate hope there's no leaks cheers
hah this reminds me of myself drilling, I also have a cheap drill.. only difference is I swear a lot while using it.. nice vid, cheers
I feel like I should state that a bi metal hole saw is going to be much better for this type of job in most cases. Step drills are made for thin sheet metal and will be very difficult to use for anything thicker than this. So investing in a set of hole saws and some cutting oil is a must if doing anything thicker.   Cheers.
Well done mate, I was surprised there was no swearing given the drill you had, but you got there in the end!  Was that step drill bit specifically for stainless steel?
Nice one bud I'd be scared to drill in case I bugger it up and end up with a 2ft hole.
Great video Dino. I use a bit of dishwash detergent as lube/cutting oil and it works well. Mind you I use a shitty old rusty power drill but it does the job. Glade to see you got it setup. I wanted a themowell but had it in my head it has to be in the middle but it doesn't so I think I will copy you. Cheers!
