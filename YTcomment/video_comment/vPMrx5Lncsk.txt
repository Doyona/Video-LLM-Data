I have an idea but its a little crazy. So I dont have a hose or a connection where I live, but I have a yard and a lawn chair. Do you think itll work if I take the tree outside and let the rain water clean it off? Im due for a soaker tomorrow and I'm really thinking about trying this and spraying it right before it starts to rain and let it sit out for about an hour or until clean.  Is it possible?😅 I have a 7ft tall artificial ficus tree that has baby powder all over it from baby. I need it cleaned desperately. I can go out and buy a hose, but it would have to be a very long hose about 75-100 feet for to fit from my kitchen sink to my back door and outside. I dont have much space to store the hose afterwards. Please let me know what you think about this crazy idea. Thanks
She doesn’t even say what she is spraying on it!! How’s that help?
I am going to have hanging artificial plants indoors.  And won't be able to bring them down to clean them. Any suggestions.
Thanks for this tip.  I have a faux olive tree that goes to the ceiling and very dusty.  Next to removing the branches, soaking them in the bathtub and hot gluing them back on, your idea makes more sense and a whole lot easier.  Be blessed. 😊
Why an outside plant need cleaning?
Why not just wash it in running water only. Other videos show it and the results are the same.
Will you be making more videos? I'm loving your book and the videos, but all of the videos are at least 4 years old. I would like to see more please.
Thank you so much!  Your video was extremely helpful!
Great video but boy I wish you would have not Sprayed the bottle as you were talking very difficult to hear you and annoying as all heck
Where did you get the tall Palm tree from?
Man, this worked perfectly! I had a tall silk ficus in my office and without warning or covering things up the building re-roofed it to the studs. There was debris everywhere and I thought that plant was ruined it was so filthy. Only a couple minutes and it looks good as new using this method!
Hello there, great video! I have 4 silk ficus trees in my house, what other solution can I use to clean the silk leaves? I live in Mexico and the product you are using does not exist here. I hope you will answere my question. Gracias from Mexico
I used to hang my blinds outside like she does to clean them.  Sure miss this trick since living in an apartment.
My expensive silk ficus tree must be dry dusted because the color runs if wet.  I use a dust whisk then I vacuum the carpet. Also a small stool to get at the top.  It's realistic but the leaves are not shiny.  I would love to brush paint them with something clear to get the leaves shiny and easier to brush the dust off.  Any ideas about a non water base clear finish I can put on them?  Thanks
Put the POT in a garbage bag and tie it tight!  DUH !
Great video !  Have been trying to clean this 6 foot tree for years, thank you.
I put the base /basket in a plastic trash bag and ty it up so water won’t damage it also I do the trunk of the “tree” too ! Works but still be careful not get water on the bag opening,some water could get in ! Thanks for sharing your wonderful advice . Will hit the subscribe button ! 👍🦋🌈👵🏻🐶😺
