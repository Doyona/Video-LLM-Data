I’m a plopp person, center is just too sugary for me
Whoever came up with the name "Plopp" for a candy bar is a bamf!
You should try putting your chocolate bar in the fridge! It makes it snappier, more chocolatey, and I love the sound of cold chocolate when you snap it and it hits the other chocolate!
Americans is Brainwashed with suger....Tragic
Does a Daim bar cost only a dime?
Daim cake is one of the most delicious cakes I've ever eaten. We usually get that one with my friend when we celebrate our birthdays. Thank you Sweden for these tasty candies. ❤️ ~A chocoholic from Finland 😘
Daim bars are the best, second only to Toblerone 🤩
Det enda problemet med alla dessa underhållande filmklipp är att man blir så godissugen. Har precis attackerat godishyllan och gjort ett stort hål i förrådet. Bland annat försvann det en påse Kryptoniter, mums :-). Thanks for all your stuff. It's great! It's funny to see and hear your reactions. I like to buy food and candy on ebay, from different countries, and seeing you try the same things from your perspective is really interesting. Keep up the good work!
Center is usally  round
Bubblig means bubbly
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie...
aww i miss this kind of videos from u emmy!!
& right before you said what you do with what’s left of what you try, I was just thinking 🤔 hmmm wonder what happens to the stuff she doesn’t finish lol love your content!
I think that chocolate bar would be closer to a symphony bar here in the states because it has toffee in it
So it’s the Swedish version of a heath bar
who's winston?
OMG someone actually prounaced daim correctly! :D
i am center
I love your hair <3
Chocolate and licorice just doesn't sound good at all. I'm American,  but my mother is from Malmo, Sweden. We were raised eating salmiak, double salt licorice and all kinds of Swedish licorice. I remember when she would come home from trips to Sweden and she would have a small duffle full of bags and bags of licorice! Yummmm!
I love Extra Strong Original, but I hate the salmiak-version. When I want salmiak-flavour, I go for Lakrisal (Trying to remember if you've tried that in one of your videos)
In the beginning Center was a roll and plopp was a bar - like the Marabou-bars, but smaller. Now there are Plopp-rolls and Center-bars of that description as well as those bars you tried.

Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie. :)))))
I am from Sweden!
I like plopp better because of the rhyme on the wrapper. "När du börjar äta plopp kan du aldrig sätta stopp!" it translates roughly to "When you start eating plopp you can never stop!". Kinda like "When you go black you never go back." :D
You can usually find Daim and many other types of Swedish candy on Amazon.com. Will be a bit pricey, of course. My American hubby's favorite is Kex Chocolate by Cloetta. He orders them, claiming it's for me, then eats most of them. LOL
Licorice>any food you make ;P Trololo
I really love these videos and to hear you trying to pronounce the Swedish names of candies and IKEA food. A tip is to use Google Translate when you're uncertain and click the little speaker icon. I noticed in the comments to your "eats Sweden 3" that there were some borderline nationalistic comments about where Dumle and Fazer comes from. The fact is that Dumle was made by Swedish company Mazetti that was bought by Finnish Fazer Group in 1975. Also, Nordic candy companies have bought each other, merged and split up in all manners of formations since ... forever, and they have created new candies and took the candies of the other company when they split up. So what company created what candy and so on is quite hard to determine.
does she have a husband
Aren't you gonna introduce Mr Koala in the background? :) I found myself starring at him the entire video😂💜
Sweden has the best chocolate! I guess I'm biased as I used to live in Sweden!  Great video!
im neither plopp or center
I'm from Sweden and even I didn't know we hade daimed flavored coffe... Hahahah
The queen was in the parlour,Eating bread and honey.
Clicked on this just because I love Sweden and I'm learning swedish (and yes I'm a Pewdiepie fan xD LOL)
Sweeden! Can you believe that? Sweeden!!!   Nothing happened there, it's incredible.
I hear a static sound :( fix it emmy please
four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie🍰😊
I prefer Plopp over Center! They're both good, though.  My mom likes Center better.
I loooovvveee Daim! :)
The second one I can find In a small sweet shop in the city centre, I buy them all the time and I put them on ice cream, cakes or I just eat them haha I live in the U.K. FYI
ploop
I Love daim
Emmy is wonderful.
don't they sell daim chocolate in regular shops in the US?
salmiak the stronger the better, a taste you really dont understand heh
Salmiak, gods gift to man. Love it. :D
Plopp and Djungelvrål! Always!
I'm going to Alaska this Summer for salmon fishing, maybe I can send some Alaskan specialties!
I've just been watching video after video. I don't really care about the food, I just like watching her eat and laugh and be super cute! It's kind of mesmerizing, but also relaxing and soothing.
I hate licorice
I love the center bar
she's adorable!
It makes me angry that you bite chocolate 😅😂😂😂😂
Sweetens chocolate called Marabou and has a M as Logo. They neighbor country Norway chocolate is called Freija and has a Marabou bird as Logo. 😂
Daim always cuts my tung 😛It tastes so good you can't stop. Daim Ice makes me feel sick . I love Daim anyway.
I actually don't like Daim that much.. I don't really like toffee that much
four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie!
Lol, I love your pronunciation. You're pronouncing it like "Maribo", as if you're saying "Haribo" Japanese style. ;P
Please do more swedish candy
The daim cookies makes a great combination with a cup of coffee; and voilá! You have a nice fika just for you! :D  And you have the cutest laugh and smile, Emmy! Always makes me smile :)
Yaaay i am from sweden
be careful with that center bar! it's more addicting than cocaine... (not really) but i did genuinely have a good three months, were i was not able to go through the day without eating at least one.. i once ate seventeen in one day :) greetings from denmark!
Who's Winston?
do you make any sweets from other places Halloween candy?
No, there is not much discussion about plupp vs center, we are an accepting culture. That said: people who prefer plupp should be eutanized.
Daim bar is sort of like a skor bar. While a center bar is sort of like a caramilk bar. Or for americans caramello.
There Is More Other Daim Products
I would love to send you some swedish stuff. How do I do that? I know exactly what I would send. :D
plopp! also try the chocolate bar with black liquorice in it it's in a league of its own if you like black liquorice EDIT: saw the end of the video now.. don't try it ^^
I like center better.
we eat about all of those in Finland
This is how I get fat 😭😭
i am swedish and i like  more plopp
we have those marabou xl cookies in finland
You know there's actually Daim Almondy cake 400g you can buy this in ikea and there superyummy 😄😄😄😄😄
It's caramel inside of the marabou bubblig :D yumyum
Oh my gosh. Does anybody else have of fear of a bunch of tiny holes, especially in food? When she showed that one bar with bubbles I was literally cringing.
Plopp ! Lol
In Denmark we bake 'Daim-cookies' for Christmas - it is amazing. Just a regular vanilla cookie dough that you add chopped Daim to. Easy and good!
the swedish chocos are the most disgusting stomach turning ever... dont try daim especially i tried it spit it out and left me a horrible aftertaste... none r worth trying i swear to god  but the asian girl is super
That's a lot of chocolate.
Emmy I challenge you to eating Carolina reaper pepper challenge
have you ever tried kex? its another swedish candy, but it's kinda like a kit kats. they're really good? :p
this how you get... fat that was funny😂
daim is norwegian...
center! I hate plopp it is a huge difference when you grow up with it :)
Plop
Kik Me @ Niinnaaa331 I Wanna Start A Chanel & Do Videos & Also Swaps & Give Always Please Please Please Contact Me To Help Me With Some Courage To Make One Thank You ☺💖
CENTER IS THE BEST!! 🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪
im swedish and you are pronouncing it wrong its pronounced like DAME and you done say the I. :)
CENTER
I'm not religious, so I take no part in the Plopp vs. Center schism. One day, we will awake from our outdated beliefs, and realize that it was all just chocolate, and the difference was merely in our heads. :)
FINALLY someone who tests marabou chocolate!!!!
center!
Center❤️ these Swedish taste tests are so fun to watch, cause I'm from Sweden :))
The air bubbles made me feel very uncomfortable I can't look at holes without getting really weird not pleasing feeling XD
I’m definitely a Center gal! ;) xx
90% of sweden would say CENTER
i like center bar more because it has more chocolate. Love your swedish videos <33
Only me that feel special When she eat Swedish candy Cause i'm Swedish
I like the Center bar much better!😍 I'm Swedish!
Dumle should have been included
center!
#teamCENTER!
You need to try Lakrisal if you haven't already ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
What editor do you use I love it
daim bars are available everywhere in the uk. would be cool if they were in the us too :)
Plopp <3
Plopp all the way
Plopp ❤️❤️❤️😍
Plopp before Center - any time.. :)
When you eat marabou bubblig you have to take a big bite to understand the greatness.
MARABOU WITH AIRBUBBLES IS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD!!!
I love the bubbly chocolate! For me it tastes so much better (you should eat it in whole pieces for a better experience). :) I have no sense of smell though so texture is really important!
the bubble chocolate bar sent chills up my spine.. so many holes e__e
Not a caramel person i dont like plopp and center so much, but i agree that center are a litte bit better.
I love your eyes
You know, you can turn a Marabou chocolate bar upside down and pretend it was made in the Willy Wonka factory...
im a ceneter fan i buying all the time
just so u know the marabou premium is not swedish. i repeat its not swedish.  marabou is swedish but the chokolate isnt swedish at all. not even made here.  and yes im swedish
Lol "sigh..... What a disaster....."
Emmy why did you pour all of the powder lol 🙈
We want to see "Emmy eats Surströmming" :D
plopp
Center buries plopp in the dust, åtta dar i veckan.
Center all the way
Center
What is it that you say before tasting something? :)
Mmm swedes eat only chocolate
im a center person
to bad you didn't get the limited edition daim also
Center person🙋🏼
omg, im sorry but when she eats something she makes those really annoying faces and noises like stop plz 😩😩😩
Am I odd that I let chocolate melt in my mouth? Rather than chew it? Or rather I did. I haven't eaten candy for almost two months now.
Maybe the coffee mixing thingie at the end was a joke BUT if it wasn't, I have a solution! :D  I drink hot cocoa almost every day (my favorite recipe is 3 heaping tsps milk powder, 1 tsp cocoa, 2 tsp sugar and a tiny pinch of salt and of course milk!) and the best thing to do is add just a little bit of the milk to the powder and mix it to form a paste first!  Then add enough milk to make it homogeneous and then mix in the rest of the milk :D  It always works perfectly :3
When Can you make  Popin' Cookin❤️
my brother brought me Cadbury diary milk Daim form the UK and it was so good!!! yuummm never had daim before
kids likes plopp more and adults like center more😂
Plopp =) and I love the one with the cactus flavor =)
I am swedish, I prefer center over plopp.
I love salmiakki 😍😍😍😍
Emmy could you do a video on mochi ice cream please???  Xoxoxo
Center!! ^-^
I'm a center person. It's interesting  that you find the licorice "artificial" since it's a root! 😀🌱
Alla svenskar som kollar på detta heeej!!!/ Every swedish people that is watching this video helloooo!!!!
I love both Plopp and Center! I can't decide!!
They sell Milka Daim in Germany :)
center!!
Center are so much better than Plopp :D
What do u do with all your opened leftovers?
You should also try marabou oreo
Plooooopp
i love ploop :) We have daim ice cream too with vanilla ,chocolate, pear and strawberry  :D
SKITTLES! but my little one didn't want to walk so much this year.  There wasn't a lot going on in our little corner of the neighborhood and i think she got discouraged.  anyways, the point of all that was to say so i'm not really raiding it because she doesn't have much.
CONGRATS ON 500,000 SUBSCRIBERS EMMY!🎈🎉 I love you and keep up the AMAZING work!
Haha, I enjoyed the elevator music during the intermission :D
Center!
❤️winston lol!
I hate Daim bars and I'm English
in my experience, the center bar has more of a salty caramel than the plopp :) Neither is my favorite kind of candybar, but if i had to choose between them, I'd go for the center :)
You should rename it to "tasting Scandinavia" as us Scandinavian countries do share a lot - if not all, of these products.
I like the center bar the most :D
I am a plopp swede hahah
Center ofc!
Center IS better! =) <3
I am Plopp all the way. You can also buy Center from pick-and-mix and they have a way more runny inside then. I do not enjoy that.
goodness Emmy! I've missed you so much! I haven't come to check out your channel since you had 250,000 subscribers! I'm so happy for you! almost at half a million! I miss your old lower quality videos, although good for you that you have all this gorgeous equipment! how are the babies? do you still have 2 babies or 3 maybe?
Love the Daim Bar!! It's so good!  Awesome video!
You're such a trooper with the salmiakk
I love your description of the taste experience
Emmy, I love your videos and have been watching them for some time now. Love your sunny personality and your reviews. Even the things you don't like you try to review fairly, which is nice. Great vids! :)
Hi emmy. Please do review of eaten "Surstömming" . It's a traditional swedish dish . It's Baltic Herring that has fermented for months. And it's though to be among the smelliest food in the world. I hope u read this 😉
You should try marabou Premium with raspberry or mint etc.
Pls do more eating video!! 😍
Why is she almost wispering? It's weird
why do u never reply to my posts emmy. i wanted to send you stuff.
+emmymadeinjapan  I just now discovered that salmiakki is actually made with ammonium chloride instead of sodium chloride (salt). Could it be the reason of your strong reaction at it? Never ever eaten, so Idk how it could be.
All that looks so good! Lol :)
and everywhere in the UK an ind Europe
Awesome!
Its funny cause. Im from sweden and love eating swedish candy. The same time you eat it so i also can react
I love Marabou milk chocolate and Centers are my secret weakness! Can you humans imagine that! Coz... I.... am... from... Finland!! BTW I hate you Swedish around icehockey world championship games!!.. But otherwise you are ok! :) :D :D :D
Stop eating please!!!!! More cook! I Miss your kitchen :(
Yay im happy :D
Ahh, the slippery slope!  It's starts with dark chocolate infused with that stuff, and ends on a plane to Copenhagen!
center❤
What a blessing beeing you! Enjoying ALL THAT chocolates! ️Jajaja. LOVE your vídeos. Cheers from Mexicali, México.
center är bästa av dom enligt mig men plopp är popuärast center is best akording to me but in sweden is plopp most popular
i love candy from marabou!! marabou is a Swedish chokolate factory  <3 :D i live in sweden!
Even after all these years I still laugh when Emmy eats liquorice!
I love your voice :O
to me center and plopp is the same.. but for some reason i always go for center haha..
Aw he forgot to send you Daim with Mint flavor ;)  I love Marabou Premium, especially with mint or coffee flavor. Salty licorice... No...
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie :p
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie :p
CENTER
Her voice is so soothing!! She should do an ASMR video, I would dieeee
I'd prefer Plopp! I guess that the flavour of Plopp is a bit more "childish" than Center. All kids like it more (includes me) however it's a constant debate between us Swedes :D
Center every day 👍🏻
i've never seen those "extra strong" here in sweden :o
Någon som är från Sverige här?  Iallafall hej på er från Täby, Stockholm
where's the LAKRITZ?
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie☺️
mjölk
I can't stand those tablet mints ... my bampa always kept a few around and would give me them all the time but I never liked the texture!
Plopp>Center . Btw, you made me crave daim chocolate now, this is mean...I'm a swede but I have moved to the other side of the world and that adorable stuff doesn't exist here. And I would kill for some licorice too!! Really, I shouldn't have watched this video ... :(
I prefer the Center one. I think the difference between Center and Plopp is that one of them they cooked the toffee a bit longer than the other.
I like the less sickly sweet taste and slightly less smooth consistency of the caramel in center over plopp
There actually is a Daimbar with mint chocolate... it's amazing! And i agree with you, licorice is horrible!
Hahah she was like "ah there's two now you can share it with a buddy". And I'm here like 'I aint sharing nothing thats my food '
How do I send you a package?
We have daim Ice cream 😃 it's so good! Vanilla Ice cream with bits of daim mixed in!
center person ;)
Plopp person of course cx
i love licorice
i love maribou chocolates. i think that they are the best quality chocolates i've ever tried and i live in switzerland:)...
So you rather get your friends fat then yourself?
Plopp ls the best
I think Center taste like higher quality than Plopp. Here in Norway we only have Center and not Plopp, but then again we have Smil which is better than both of them so I always buy Smil. Then when I'm in Sweden I buy Plopp just because we don't have it here :)
Shouldn't have seen this in bed b4 sleeping😂anyone else having an extreme chocolate craving rn loool😂?
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.
Is there some sweets that you've eaten from Sweden that you really hated, except liquorice?
Marabou was invented in Norway, not Sweden.
I strongly believe that you would like raspberry/licorice sculls. Gummy candy.mProbably available at IKEA.
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie! Nice one Emmy: you do keep persevering with the Salmiaki don't you? Fun fact: when Daim launched in the UK, they called it 'Dime' for years, only changing to the standard spelling in 2005. In the mid 1990s they had a TV commercial featuring the comedian Harry Enfield playing an outrageously stupid character trying to get a Dime bar. It entered popular culture, and for a while, shouting "Dime Bar! Diiiiime Baaaar!" in a moronic voice was a thing: kind of like parodying the way people speak s.l.o.w.e.r and s.i.m.p.l.e.r to a non-English speaker, as if they're stupid rather than foreign.
Emmy eats România part 2 ?
Center!!!
So in the US daimbars aren't in every other supermarket/grocery store? Because in Holland they are!
I'm sorry Emmy, but I love the faces you make when you don't like what you're tasting XD But you're still so kind and fair to things you think are gross!
I am a Plopp person! :D
Is a Daim the equivalent of a Heath in the U.S.?
I like plopp more
I wonder if the Plopp pattern is ripples in water, considering that "plopp" is an onomatopoeia of something hitting water, not too dissimilar to "splash" in English.
I'm Norwegian and we have all this in Norway too c:
Center all the way! I don't really like plopp, it's too sweet in the wrong way.
plopp person
Plopp❤️❤️
Plopp jag gillar plopp (swedish😋) plopp i like plopp
Plopp was so good!.... untill I ate to many :P

I am a Plopp person, I don't like center o.o
I'm from sweden and center is the best hands down 🙌🏼
I'm vegan now and don't eat plopp or center, but when I was younger I always had plopp. I have no idea why, since I actually liked center better.
center wins
I'm a plopp person! 😉
The little pebbles candy was a dime bag... Haha with pronunciation that's pretty funny
Center :)
Dammm 496k lol
Where is Emmy eats India???
Daim-kryss is the best!
I liked the 70'-80's 2-piece iteration of Plopp, which had way thinner chocolate and more oozy goo inside.
WHO IS WINSTON!?
I am a CENTER person !!! Sweden here 😂🍃
In Ireland you can get Dairy Milk bars with pieces of Daim. So good!
Whoever dislikes Emmy has no soul             (\(*(-)*)/) penguin: penguin approves!
I prefer centre over plopp ;P
It's a bit embarrassing that is is the eighth video. It proves how much candy we actually eat in Sweden. :')
Munching some snacks while watching your videos is a really great combination Emmy! Hahaha. :)
I LOVE YOUR "TASTING SWEDISH TREATS". KEEP UPP THE GOOD WORK.  Love, Simon from Sweden
I'm Swedish and definately a Center person haha! I love licorice too, unlike you! I like watching your reactions though, haha. Also, four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie ;D
IM FR.O.M. SWEDEN, YOU CAN ASK ME SOMETHING IF YOU WANT😉
This video was great! I always get so excited when I see that you're about to taste Sweden! Oh and I am 100% a center fan. They have almost like a rollo look when you buy them in loose weight! 💕
I love your liquorice face :D
Plopp FTW!!!!
Center! i hate plopp in that form, plopp is better as a whole chocolate bar!
Center!!
Loooove this!!! It's so fun watching. U taste sweden ^^
Daim chocolate is dangerously addictive. If I eat some I'll never stop and keep craving it. That's why I didn't buy it for years.
Daim bars are the best! Sofie is Swedish and tried for years to get me to like liquorice but it's not happening!
Diabetes never looked cooler
this my faforite food emma
this my faforite food emma
Damn Son :o i Love these Cookies :D
Center! :D
Plopp Always 🍫
The only time I've tasted Daim was in a Milka chocolate bar. So good~
Many people said licorice candy is popular because of the love for salty foods. Sweden, and the rest of the Nordic region, had to rely on salted meats and fish to last through the long winters. That love of salt did not dissipate when licorice was introduced at the apoteket as a medicinal product in the 1800s pcake STHLM. “Swedes and licorice have similar personalities: it takes time to become friends and break down a Swede’s barrier. In the same way, it takes time to learn and love the taste of licorice.”
daim(day-m
When I was younger, I remember smashed up Daim bars being sprinkled all over the cream on a Christmas trifle. Unusual, but more interesting than Hundreds and Thousands or Cadbury's Flake.
I love Center more than Plopp, but nothing beats Plopp-salmiak! :)
four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie!
four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie!
Center bar is amazing 😀😊
Emmy, did you know the chemical used to get that salmiak flavour is ammonium sulfide? I love it!
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.. :P
Center is sosoooo much better than plopp, the amount of times I've argued with my friends which one's better is ridiculous
I also like Center better than Plopp 😊
Daim bars are English get it right
I'm a chocoholic but I'm also super particular when it comes to what I like. I cannot stand chocolate that snaps when you bite into it. I like my teeth to sink into chocolate..a soft creamy texture is always a sign of high quality chocolate ;) My favoutite brands are Milka and Galaxy and I always leave it somewhere warm before I eat ig :D
What a great package! I love that you are still game to try the licorice! =}
"Plopp" is the thing😍
In the UK you can get Pocky called Mikado and they do a Daim flavour as do Cadbury
U said it taste like aspertame....I swear I thought u were going to say it tastes like ass! LMAO!
Four and twenty blackbirds baked into a pie:)
Something was humming in this video.
I'm Swedish and i like booth but center is my favourite👌🏽💜
And im a center ALL THE WAY! Center is popular since i was like 4 Plopp just got popular like last year haha
Marabou is the most popular bar in Sweden so They wanted to contact daim who also is popular! The marabou has LOTs of flavour But Also flavours with japp, plopp, daim and stuff who is other chocolatebars
looks sooooo good
Im center all the way 🙌  #swedish
Huh....I've always dreaded trying super dark chocolate. Idk I love dark chocolate but I'm not sure shoot trying higher percentages...
your voice is so nice
Daim is soo gooood *-*
four and twenty black birds baked in a pie <3
I swear people send you licorice on purpose because they know you hate it. HAHa! And because I you strongly dislike it, I feel for you every time you have to taste it. But what a lovely taste test to "have" to do, overall!! 🤗
When is the next Emmy eats Finland?
My daughter and I have watched you for over a year now, and I have to say, we just love to watch your videos, we go to our World Market the next day and try to find what amazing treats have been sent to you lol. Thnk you for being someone so wonderful to watch every week!
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie. (Or you could use the sour cream apple pie recipe I emailed to you last year. :P) The Daim bar sounds wonderful, I need to get one the next time I go to Ikea, for sure.
Skor bar (had to look u the spelling, I was going to type score) must be a Northern thing. I've never heard of it!
I didn't  care very much for the Daim bar I found the bar at World Market
Will you make another Emmy Eats the Philippines video soon? :3
The Marabou Daim looked delicious.
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie... complete with salmiak topping
i laughed so hard at the very end with the messy cup of coffee!!!
I've been raiding my boys Halloween candy.  What's your favorite?
Emmy! Can you taste test gooseberries?
all most 500 k sub's go Emmy :)
I love daim! I had it in Iceland
Emmy has such beautiful teeth :)
It is so funny to see your reaction to licroice lol sorry Emmy
Ha ha I love that "playing" noise! That's what it sounds like when my boys play inside!
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie. Which can't possibly taste very good. You will never like salmiak. I don't think there's any way I'll try that stuff because it sounds very icky.
I wish i has enough money to be able to buy and send you all the different marabou milk chocolate flavours. I've been wanting you to do a comparison video on them for a while. Anyways, great video as always and I can just hope that someone who isn't a 17 year old without a job comes around and does it for me :P
I love PLOPP!!!! :D
Woah... I never realized Plopp and Center were pretty much the same thing.
I am a plopp person {I am from sweden so yeah} I want to send you some more  sweets from sweden but I don't know how and what you want to get from me! Please tell me I want to send you more of our goodies ❣ Love ya❣
Awesome! Four and twenty blackbirds!
tehrs so manny difrent premium chokolate bars that i think youd love
oooh!! i eat the strong one every weekend i looooove it<3 mint tablets<3<3
Waitwaitwaitwaitwaitaminute....!Who's Winston?
This is your best video ever, obviously. ;)  And you are right, Center *is* the correct answer in the eternal battle between Center and Plopp. I'll glare menacingly at anyone that says otherwise. o.O  Sorry about the licorice, it's mandatory and out of my hands. Can't mess with tradition.
These always make me so hungry... :P And makes me crave licorice!
I think your scandinavian viewers enjoy torturing you by sending you salty licorice in every package :D They just know how much you love it! And the fact that you keep trying it even thought you freaking hate it, just encourage them.
+emmy made in japan. hii I suggest u to do some indian video also :-D
I'd love to send you some 100% dark chocolate from Guatemala when I go there. It tastes almost like espresso and even has a slight tobacco flavor. I've never tasted tobacco, but it seemed like it had the taste of the smell of tobacco. Very interesting. I'm sure you'd love it. It's very, VERY brittle, so I'm not sure how it would stay together through shipping.
I love your video! They make me so happy :3
Is it bad that I love watching Emmy taste licorice?? Sorry Emmy!!!!
I love how you choose to stay open minded about the licorice people constantly send you. Even though you know you hate it, you choose to think your opinion could change.
Plopp, for sure! 🙋
is it bad that I cringe every time she says those Japanese words?
Emmy, you know what.. I think you can consider filming a HOW TO TAKE CARE OF MY TEETH video! You have perfect teeth. Can't stop looking at them when you talk. Haha
+emmymadeinjapan do you like books? If so, have you read To Kill A Mockingbird? I finished it this year in 6th grade.
The last clip! XD Hahaha, Emmy what's going on here??
plopp!! 😊😊
lol I was gonna say it looked like a skor bar XD
Center shuld be eaten in round packs, like a stick with 20 round oned in top of each other
Skors bar....drooool
you should try more japanese candy assembly :)
Plopp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The cookies remind me of the French brand Granola (by LU) cookies with Daim. Probably almost identical.
Number 14!
I think I might have to try a bar, Skor & Heath bars are my absolute favorite!
My friend moved to Sweden in 2th grade and I was so made btw I live in the us so now I know what candy she eats
Awesome video
love these videos!
