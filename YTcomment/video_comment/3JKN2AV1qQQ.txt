Glad he left it in the skillet! Everybody I see wanna use all those dishes! I'm the one who gotta wash them! LOL
Congrats
Perfect, best demo of CP I have seen yet.  Thank you
Made it tonight!  🏆 thanks!
Finally someone that use enough capers which is what makes the dish.
👍🇪🇬😋
Should have made a roux with butter and flour before dropping the wine and stock. Way better alternative than to sprinkle flour in like that!!!!
Hi Buddy, this comes from Malta GC in the Mediterranean.... South of Scilly 😀 the Italian side of my mother's family ran from Garebaldi.  Would love to buy your cook book, so long as it doesn't come from the States.     In fact just preparing the roast potatoes, sweet and regular.  My mouth is watering, and you are  currently on my TV screen. Claire P H
Do you have substitute for garlic because I’m allergic to garlic and I’m also pregnant I would like make it
I like the old man's recipe better leave the chicken in the sauce about 10 min buddy leaves it for 1 minute
No, you put the capers in before the wine, to cook off some of the brininess! I've done it this way in the past, and sautéing the capers before is FAR BETTER!! You can still use the wine to deglaze the pan, but capers first!
Super 💕😘💕😘😘❤️🤩
Just great
Chef...your recipes never fail. I hope you did recover from your accident. We all miss you and your great show! Looking forward to see you back soon.🎖🏆🙏
I’m in the kitchen
hey chef thanks for explaining that butter and oil thing, honestly i always wondered why we add butter when theres already oil.... salud
The idea that adding butter to oil will to prevent it (the butter) from burning is absurd.
Him eating this chicken piccata infront of me is tough to take, good video.
Hey Buddy! Firstly we love your show cake boss! We went by your place in Vegas when we visited grabbed some pastries and had some dinner across the way as well! I wanted to thank you for putting this recipe for chicken piccata on YouTube! It is one of my favorite Italian dishes and we have made this using your video at least half a dozen times or more. It took us a few times to get it right… But I got a tell ya  each and every time it comes out “mm mmm good!” Lol! Thank you for the recipe and the how to!!!
3:29 "fuego fuego". Spanish words. Italian recipe. We are not Mexicans in italy.
I made this tonight, it came out perfect and everybody loved it!!! Thanks Buddy!
You make delicious foods.
Superb.
Isn’t Buddy the cake dude?
Sehr gut, Buddy👍 Habe ich nachgekocht, und es war SUPER 😋 LG Hans Suter, Steinen, Swizzerland 🙋🏻‍♂️
Hallo Buddy, ich bin ein Fan von dir 👍😋
I hope it tastes better than it looks because that looks like the rubber chicken you get on airlines.
Your recipe looks more appetizing than Giada's...definitely doing yours...
This recipe is BANGIN!!
That looks amazing!
miss you
That’s the same way I do it, only thing is different is I use a little lemon zest.
Hey Buddy, don’t kill me.......but can you make this KETO friendly by using almond flower? I’ve cooked this once and is it wonderful! Thank you!
Delicioso
Great recipe  But work on your broken Napolitano 😂
Great cooking and baking
WHERE is this recipe written down? WHERE is the "info" section Buddy talks about to find it? THANK YOU!
I am a massive fan of the reverb and chill background music, whoever made those two decisions is a boss lol
I take my chicken out while still a bit pink, then let it finish in the sauce.  I do cook the sauce on high to thicken it, but I let it cool down to low before putting the chicken in.  I think putting the chicken in the boiling sauce makes it firm up.  When I put the chicken in I cover it and keep the burner on very low.  This way the chicken comes up to temp while steaming.  If done right the chicken is ultra moist.  If Buddy put that last chunk of butter in the sauce at the very end, the sauce would have a more velvet texture.  Sometimes I add a bit of Dijon to the sauce.  It goes really well with the capers and lemon.
So why didn’t he dip chicken in milk before flour ???
Nice production w the music food et al.   🖖🦊☮️
Superb! Five cloves of garlic, tons of parsley, tons of capers. Buddy V. Does everything with his heart. God bless him and his family.
Delicious 😋
Good😋😋😋
I just made this and for my first attempt it came out great so tasty and flavorful
I add lemon slices as well, gives a nice presentation to the Dish:-))))
That is the BEST Garlic Press!! its pricy, I purchased mine for $40.00 a few years ago! I Love Garlic!!!  Soo easy to clean, its a Must have tool in the Kitchen!
Please level that stovetop !
Printed the recipe...Where. Is. The. Garlic?!
I’ve watched a lot chicken piccata recipes on YouTube...Your’s is the best one!  I’ll be making this soon but,  I’ll more than likely add more garlic and wine along with the stock. Thanks..
That looks FABULOUS!!!!!!
Buddy,  I have wanted to make chicken piccata for some time now.  I made it tonight following your recipe.  It was so good! I put too much lemon juice in it but other than that it was a close replica to Cheesecake Factory's version.  Many thanks!
I’ve watched a few of these and so far buddy has the only appetizing sauce that doesn’t look like water.
Very good 😋 but is not really Italian recipe...I m from Milan and for me should be Better watching the fried wings cicken recipe...I love It ...crispy and crispy...
I ❤ your food look sooo yummy😋 SUBSCRIBED - Hongkong 3/8/2020
Love Buddy!!
Mmmmmm,delicioso!!!
I made this and it came out sooooo good! I didn’t have enough parsley but it was still delicious! Will be making this recipe again. Thank you so much for sharing!
You deserve it,I'll see you with Bobby!
Love you Buddy da boss!
Add the butter to the sauce to make it silky and rich! Oh yeah.
Fuego, fuego... love when Buddy speak spanish 😍
Garlic?  This must be an American variation.
You didn’t add the cheese.
no clue what deglaze means
I’ve had blueberry cheesecake from Carlos bakery in Manhattan. It was fantastic, best cheesecake I’ve ever had
Cooking this tonight! I know everyone's gonna love it! (Just subscribed to your channel too!)
Whaaaat? 4-5 times to get this right (4:42)? He didn’t even get a nice brown crispiness on the chicken. Best to not put the chicken back in the pan. Keep the sauce separate and just spoon on top. See Ina Garten’s  recipe.
Just tried it. Simple and delicious!
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
What he cooks in the video does not match this recipe. The recipe is missing the garlic and he uses more wine than listen. ??
Amazing thank you
I wanna see more of budy cooking
Looks great
I did it😄yummy and thanks for the tips on butter👍
03-22-2020:  You're killing me, Buddy!  This looks so yummy, I'm salivating.
Y u m
No color no flavor
Absolutely Fantastic
Sorry but not cooking the chicken until it is brown on both sides is a major fail always.
Al massimo un medio lavapiatti in italia
PICCATA FOR MY BUNGHOLE!!!! ARE YOU THREATENING ME?!?!?!?!
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....nuff said!
That chicken piccata was delicious looking for sure.. it made my mouth water! However not much crusty outside..  it looked like the flour didn't form a crust on the cutlets. But it sure made me want some.
Wow must be so delicious
Way to go Buddy thanks !!!!
Why am I watching this at 1:30 in the morning and hungry?? I know what I'm making tomorrow..... 😂
Never sprinkle flour into a sauce like that. Just grab your tongs, pick up one of your cooked cutlets and coat one side in flour, and move it around in the sauce. It'll thicken the sauce and you'll avoid flour dumplings in the sauce. Keeps it smooth.
When did you add the capers
Do you have to use capers
What a nice person Carlos is. The chicken recipe looks 😋😋😋😋
i want to see more of Lisa her energy is great and same with her recipes!
Your recipe above does not have garlic. When do you put the garlic in?
No Shallots?  What a shame.
Making it tonight!  TY
What is capres
I have a Fresh King Salmon Roast caught out of the Columbia River in Pasco, WA.  I am making your perfect Lemon Sauce to bake the Salmon in.... Praying I make this Perfect like you did! I will let you know!
Good taste
I’m gunna try this out man I’ll let you know how it went
First-time viewer and I'm glad I found this.  This really looks delicious.  You appear to know how to cook!!
My favorite dish .. took me a few times to master it as well. But oh so yummy
Looks delish, gonna try it tomorrow, thanks for sharing.
Delicious!!! Thanks a lot!!
First of all, I do think this is delicious and that is beside the point I wanna make. This is NOT Piccata. I have no idea where the US has the idea that this is Piccata. The sauce you use belongs to a City in France called Grenoble and is mainly used for fish, Sole to be precise. Piccata is originally a Veal dish, but okay, you call it Chicken Piccata, so that counts as legit. Next is the prep. Till the flour your good. Missing the absolute key ingredient is a sin. You mix eggs with Parmigiano to a thick paste . The floured Chicken goes into that mix and then into your Butter/Oil mix. Fry it indeed to golden brown. Now the sauce. The Milanese sauce is always something with tomato and meat or sausage thingy. Try this: Fully cooked cow thong cut into Julienne, Salami Milano cut into Julienne and half onion rings. Fry in Olive Oil, add some diced canned tomatoes, some tomato puree, fresh chopped basil, salt and pepper. Simmer for a minute or two. Serve the Piccata with Risotto and the sauce.
really simple to follow thanks
Much better with chicken thighs.
This looks delicious
looks like cake piccata!
How you make chicken brest in thin shape
5 cloves 😆 omg lol thats like me.. when I watch these cooking shows and they use one clove of garlic i roll my eyes so hard
Great easy video to make this easy Chicken Piccata. Looks delish, can't wait to try it.
Maybe he should get better lighting.
Looks simple enough..... im gonna try this tonight.
Looks delicious ..yummy
It really looks so good but you try the one from napoli's in Hoboken??
Subscribed :) will try this out tonight.
When will you people from USA grow up and learn to hold a fork correctly, and after that learn to keep holding the fork in the same hand and cut with the other hand?
👍
yum! It was delicious
He’s like Emeril Lagasse but toned down
chicken piccata ( the original Italian recipe) has no capers and no parsley.
Buonissima thanks for the recipe ciao
Ma-done! Excellent simple dish
I feel in love with he really season his flour. None of that pinch of this or pinch of that.
That is the best chicken piccata recipe I have ever seen perfection

Cicken Piccara. L'aglio non ci va'. Il pepe e sale si mette alla fine e non con la farina cialtrone. Non sei ne italiano e ne sai cucinare e non rovinare le ricette italiane. Torna a fare le torte . Chicken piccara. Ma che cazzo dici.? Aglio.? Ma va a gangala.
E vaiii di aglio 👎👎👎
I love this so much and I love you so much buddy!! I literally have a crown with my favorite people on it and you're the main part! I've been a fan since season one of cake boss :'))
