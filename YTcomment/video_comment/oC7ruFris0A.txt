The tricks are still working or not, can anyone ensure me please?
Has anyone tried this and does this actually work? backlink outreach is tricky....
Add the Feauture Sam !
Its awsome but i think that mention alerts could have DR option  because weak domains wouldnt litter our results
Does anybody know how the "minus" operator (-ahrefs) might work for a brand name with multiple words?  -do you even blog, or would it be -"do you even blog"  ?
This features alone compensate the cost of the tool, PERIOD!
i am not able to find this feature
Thank-you for your video. I am a customer of yours. I have set up the Aherfs alert for related keywords. Do you have any solid advice about to sift through the results? For instance, I get several results from news sites but I guess it is no point contacting them for a link. (I work for a dentist) Best Andrea
we sure do want to see that feature
love your guy's sense of humor. "recruit the hype man". ROFL
All about geting backlink by sent email to the owner?

Yes, would like to see the feature web mention is linked or not. Thanks, Sam!
