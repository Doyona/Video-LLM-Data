another thing about paper - wood pulp paper is more affordable, but cotton paper is ideal. heavyweight paper is better than lightweight paper. 300lb cotton paper is the top tier but you’ll break the bank
Awesome advice....❤
Watching this 6 years later, I love your content so much!!!!!!!! you were an inspiration to me as a kid!!
Me who doesn’t care which paper I use and uses printer paper
Thank you i learn much
I like yourart style its so cute
I do wish you had a video like this but for gouache paints 😩
4:00 unf
omg watching you destroy the paper in the dramatization made me physically cringe! hahaha
between waiting for it to dry, and not understanding paint to water ratio, having bad brushes, and working far too big, it is very hard for me to understand how to use water colors. Even a single paint stroke in and my cold 140 paper is flaking. I see others paint and my paints and paper do no behave anywhere near the same.  I just bought tubes instead of half pans hoping this will fix things, but now seeing low low quality my brushes are, it makes since how I was never able to get a uniform or fine stroke.  The more I try the further from any satisfying result I've seemed to have.
How much water should use to paint? Because I always found that I use too much water or rather too much layers and the paper became too wet and starts breaking? I dont know how to describe it but it just um, yeh how do I prevent that
1:54 cant believe i actually blew on my screen thinking that hair was real….
How can I show colour bright in my painting?
What water colors do you use
Thank you so much
Fashion
Her: you should use a good quality paper Me who always used the printer paper all my life: 👁👄👁
Love it
I bought some water colors a while ago to try and get into them, but they've been sitting on my table abandoned for months cause I get frustrated so easily with my lack of ability (I'm a beginner but also a perfectionist, a perfect storm), but seeing your art style, so simplistic and sweet, is inspiring. I don't have to be watercolor Leonardo DeVinci to make a piece of art I'm proud of
when she made a hole on the paper, it hurted me, I felt that
3:50 you should make satisfying videos like this
I love water colour but I'm always scared to go darker , my pieces are very like but I'm getting better at it
Hi I know it's 2021 but my teacher added this video to our assignment can you please list out all the tips in just one list?
What is your paper using watercolor(・∀・)
me who cant be focused for 5 mins and saying im going to do water color seeing the last tip ;-;
Cool tips thank you
bruh my color is only 3 dollars
Thanks
if you mix too much you can come back to it later right? (I do this and i keep it on a little ceramic plate thing-y)
You need to make a video like:I tried to paint with makeup brushes
Her drawings remind me of the show “Hilda” on Netflix... no one else, just me?? Okie
Don't store your brushes upright. Gravity will splay your bristles even if they are bone dry, and it's virtually impossible to know whether or not the entire ferrule is dry unless you leave them to sit for days. Store them flat, or upside down in a brush rack. You can DIY a brush rack.. google. Always use a brush cleaner/conditioner to reshape the bristles and protect them when they are dry, and never leave them sitting in water. Masters solid brush cleaner/conditioner is wonderful, you can keep it right next to your rinse water and clean your brush immediately after use.
Great, informative video!
8: CHANGE UR DANG WATER EVERY TIME U CHANGE COLORS

The place you made the hole and the color you used may have been planned. I just feel like it was but also wasn’t an accident

My friends used to paint on printer paper. They made masterpieces. I still don’t know how.
Should I line first or paint?
For some reason it looks like some of the characters look self conscious of something
I can feel the pa in of having to make all these mistakes on purpose.
I just use 120 gsm paper and works fine 🤷🏻‍♀️
For paper i use a copy and its working fine for me
Thank you
How come when you paint the water stays in the lines,when I paint the water/paint goes out the lines

Even her holes are perfect 😭
That dramatization hurts me a lot
oof that hurts
THE PAPER RUBBING FOR TIP #6 HURT TO WATCH.
honestly, I really like seeing the strokes in my water color drawings :,)
The first tip about the hard lines you get if your paint gets dry is sooo hard because when I paint I try to do it fast and make sure that it is wet but one second later it is already dry!!!! 😤😤
How to avoid strokes  Very interesting
3:57 *That hurts, physically and mentally*
I felt phisical pain when you started overworking that piece like OW
A pack of watetcolor paper (12 inside) is already $7.55 USD at BLICK art store. I wish there was a pack of 30 😔

Thank you for this video. I'm attending an Illustration course and my teacher wants us to use Watercolor (ecoline) and India Ink  but doesn't teach much about the materials themselves and how to use them. Just saved this video because it's very straightforward and instructional. Thanks again!
I think dry gradient looks better
Thanks for the tips ☺

3:54 AHHHHH NOOO KASEY WHYYYYYY?
I was always told by my art teacher to always leave the brushes up (even if they’re wet) no wonder the hair has been falling out
So basically it's like decreasing the opacity on a digital paintbrush

Why dont I freeze the water colour paper in my freezer
Thank you Kasey! Yesterday while looking for a new set of erasers, I stumbled upon a good brand of watercolor paints that were on sale due to only 1 missing. They were like $7, but I got them for $2.50! It wasn't a main color (like primaries) so I gladly took them! I will be sure to remember and use these tips since I have never used watercolors. (Except for the cheap one just to good off with and not really try) Thank you again!
I am paper
4:02 you know your on your period when...
2:28 is this an American thing because we don't have ice cream like that in britain   Yh that was random...
you are a beginner for me.
Is wallpaper alright for watercolour? I've used it before and it's not terrible, bends the paper a see bit, but I could've prevented that if I held it down with tape. Also, when I went over it tons and tons and really heavily, it never started to rip up on the wallpaper, so I assume it's alright..? Yes, I just casually use wallpaper for art. Its quite a decent thickness and I have a lot spare from when my room was decorated. Might as well use it if it's white, right?
I use only water color paper and it STILL WARPS and im like WHAT DID I DO TO YOU I'm not even using a ton of water !!
What brush do you use?
My teacher showed this to my class for a water color project :3
Wait, I have seen the girl character somewhere. But where?
super helpful! thanks!
I can die while doing this and u can't hwhwhw
3:48 the *p a i n* noooooo
What pens should I use to outline a drawing before painting? My biros bleed and my copic multiliner does too
3:56  someone got her period
This will also help 👌👍
Great tips ...thankz
Thanks for the tips I’m using watercolour a lot👍🏻🙃
I should probably learn how to draw first...
4:15 this is why my art class has hair dryers
what liner is the best to use? sometimes the liner i use works perfectly and sometime the watercolour will completely cover it or it will make the pen bleed. I always wait at least thirty minutes for my pen to dry and it never works the same twice (i use the onyx waterproof pen) i used to be really good at watercolour. now when I use the exact same techniques they dont work at all. its extremely frustrating.
The thing about cheap watercolours, can you please rry out the pretty excellent or meilan watercolour 36 half pans set? They are only 20 dollars and al the reviews only said good things about them
I just recently decided to buy some water colors because I love the way they look and all the color possibilities you get with them. These tips are very helpful since I haven’t touched water colors since middle school lol
Great tips! Thank you!
0:08 on which paper is that bear with the anchors drawn?
Thank you for this. The tips helped me out a lot.
I didn’t follow them all exactly but I don’t think my painting turned out half bad! I found that there isn’t as much of a limit mixing colors with tube paints as opposed to pan colors
All of the mistakes just make my soul hurt lol
3:33 is it because of the watercolors she is using? Or is it the coldpress paper? It looks so highly pigmented and smooth, I’m amazed
For some odd reason my koi water brush won’t unscrew please help!
I watched this video before a water color assignment  Every one made most these mistakes and I only made 2 of these mistakes     . . . thanks!
4:02 through 4:05 is a period lol

I ordered mix media paper on Amazon so, lucky me!
I always over mix just because I use a nice traveling set and I only use like 3 to 5 colors at most so I just save it for next time, lol

In school we had printer paper and it always ruined our drawings and paintings

Do u know how to stop paint from drying too fast in the palette
Tip 6 was soooooo unsatisfying
4:00 perfect placement of that demonstration. Thank you.
I don't know how to watercolor although I m in class 8. Doing watercolor is very tough for me. Even I don't know that where to use water while doing watercolor. Plz help me by uploading a video on "step by step watercolor for beginners"
My problem is that ill always make a lot of mixed paint for a really big area to draw. But ill always run out. The only thing to do is add more water...  but thats lighter
It actully makes a good efect whit the border
If people are mixing not enough of there colors, what i do is: I make a painting, then (using nice watercolors and a ceramic palette) I just let them dry in the palette and use the remaining mixed color for practice, small tests, or other paintings if i have enough. no waste.
This video really helped! Thanks Kasey!!!!
I thought it was called an a ombré
Okay, I love your videos and your content. (this is not a rant for anyone hoping to get one.) but there's one thing I don't get. The broken Lineart. I love the way it looks, don't get me wrong, but... what is the technique you use?
I really like your videos they are fun and I learn from them
*3:42* FBI, Open up!
4:00 is it just me, or does that just look like the worst period ever.     Hurts even more to look at cause I'm on my period...
watching you destroy that paper really destroyed me too
EVERYTHING YOU DRAW IS SO CUTE?!! HOW!?!!!
3:42-4:00 is traumatizing
Thanks for sharing!!! I learned so much
3:44  when I am on my period
When i make a gradient and add more water it adds a blotch of too much paint. Is that because of the paper?
I reallyyyy wanna try watercolor but im too shy to ask my parents lmao
thank you so much
What a wonderful video! Great for anyone starting out painting watercolors!!! Many thanks!
What brand of paper does she use?
Paper is hairy
Pain is only waisted if it is not used
I've been following your advice and advice in general for watercolors and...  it did not work. my colors were muddy or not pigmented enough, somehow it looked veryyyy dry on paper.. until i bought good quality brushes (i used to buy sets of 10 brushes for 1$ lol) and now watercolor has never been so fun??
HOW DO U CREATE SKIN TONES WITH WATERCOLORS PLEASE TELL MEEEEEEEE

*sorting out art stuff* *clicks this video* *opens one of the art boxes* *sees a TON of water colour and paints*  “Well this is just perfect! 😂”
YOUR ARE STYLE IS SO CUTE!!!!!!!!
What kind of brushes do you use?
Those try not to be satisfied challenges are nothing compared to your videos.
Thanks for the tips!
Beginner tip: dont leave ur brushes in water cups. It warps the bristles and disolves the glue, which is why brushes fall apart.
3:50 that hurt me so much 😰
Hry kasey! I didnt know you advertised for Ohuhu before!
Need more tips? Here are 10 more: https://youtu.be/fYuDo1jnLwQ
I'm sure somebody had asked you this but what about stuff like mixed media paper? Personally, I use mixed media with watercolors and I get pretty good results.  My other question is how you feel about watercolor pencils, crayons and water based brush pens that pick up pigment when you add water? I use watercolor pencils, my most favorite are flesh tones because finding a good skin colored art supply is hard and paint mixing recipes are hard (I know you can't spell paint without pain).
Although I've dabbled for over 40 years, my favorite watercolor project was one I did many years ago: a 12x12 hand-bound book I made for some friends where I depicted them and their adopted toddler son in a dozen different cartoon-y scenes (bath time, camping, pool party, spaghetti dinner, et cetera) as a gift for them when the adoption was finalized. Kind of like "Oh the places you'll go together". It was well-received, and they first kept it on display in their house before eventually unbinding it and framing the individual pages to hang in their family room. I was very proud of that piece. It cemented my reputation among my circle of friends as "the artistic one".  The son is about to graduate high school, and he sent me a note asking if I would mind him 'reproducing my art,' because he wants to blow up one of the images into a larger version and frame it for his parents. I was touched, not to mention impressed that he understands artist's rights! But I did ask him to please send me a recent picture of his family so I can make a new watercolor for them as well. That's how I came to be looking at your videos. I want the new one to be the best quality, and your tips will help. Thanks!
The Kasey in the gradient tip looks kinda high or in a trance
Thanks you for your amazing tips 😍  In fact, i'm trying to learn how to use watercolors and your advice is really very useful 😢I hope you continue to make great videos  (sorry i spreak very bad english)
My art teacher showed my class this
The last time I tried watercolour it all ran off of the canvas.
When you're on your period 4:00
*DRAMATIZATION*
OK I clicked back on this from your new 10 tips video, I did give it a thumbs up but no comment. I have learned that this is not YouTube algorithm friendly, I E not leaving a comment with a thumbs up! So here’s another comment. Q. Would you rather sell a piece of art or a Patreon Subscription, even if it is just a $5 Sub? You do get more from your Patreon’s correct? Just curious. . .
How do you come up with so many amazing ideas for your artwork. I'm not to creative
This was soooo helpful thank yooouuuu!!
what if you don't have enough money for tubes and can only get the trays?
I just got a watercolor set for Christmas, and it’s a completely new medium for me. This video has been really helpful and I’m looking forward to getting started on some paintings of my own! 😁

Well I'm not a beginner, but I could use some help, thanks!
Hi Kasey,Im sure this will never be seen but I have a question! I do water colors a lot and to draw the line art im usually stuck between a regular ink pen and a Sharpie,When I use the ink pen and color my painting the ink rises from where it was left and the end result of my painting is black! Are micron pens a better option? And are they water proof? Please let me know!^^
😩😩😩
Is artist loft watercolors good
This is SO helpful. Thank you!
Yeeeees I FINALY going this vid
Maybe it isn’t the techniques but my drawing skills in general lol
I’m just wondering what pens and pencils are best for watercoloring, I hate how some pens bleed into the water color and pencils that effect the color of the watercolor by the lead mixing into it.
How do you get your paper not to warp?
Wow thanks I really needed some help with water coloring 😆
When you Put a rip into the paper in the girls skirt for some reason to me it looked like the girl was having her period and the hole being her...(coughs) umm...you know
Just got water colors for Christmas and this was very useful!!!!
The 7th is the only rule of that I keep breaking and regret it
I honestly love your work so much! I used to despise watercolors, well I more despised working with them, seeing them in paintings and other works looked nice but they just weren’t for me. I came across your channel about a year ago tho and I absolutely loved your work(still do) and your work eventually got me into watercolors! I actually enjoy them more than marker even! Watercolors have a much better variety especially when swatching. I just recently made a character with only two green watercolors because of swatching while with markers I’d have to buy a ton of greens! I still might use markers but your work has really inspired me to tryout something I haven’t used in a long time and never planned to use for personal work! Now I’m absolutely in love with them, thank you!
Thank u sooo much!
Cold press has a rly cool and nostalgic vibe bcuz of its texture.
2:16 how does her paper towel look so dry??! When I use it, it’s looks like I poured my whole cup on the towel
I just got a beginning art kit..any tips?
Hi Kasey! Do you stretch your watercolor paper? I work with 140 lbs  paper and  still buckles.Suggestions?
Ughh thank u so much!!! I apply too much pressure and leave my paintbrushes up went drying  Will fix!!
My struggle with watercolor is  1. I can’t make stright line 2. Everytime im doing watercolor it keeps out of the line(?) it makes it so messy and i dont like it ( that’s my biggest struggle) 3. Im inpatient so water keep flowing everywhere:(
How do I use a cheap Brush?
Thanks this helped me a lot :3
Why does that girl have a hole on her crotch?????
I was once using blue water color on this sad image and it spreaded to the eye and it just looks like the character cried
OWL 🦉 NOOOOOOOO
You inspired me to get try water colours so I'm getting them for xmas ♡^♡
what water color do you use
О боже,вы испортили рисунок,ради того,чтобы показать нам,что станет с бумагой,если много тереть по одному месту кисточкой :)
Your own character reminds me of _Chara_ from  _Undertale_
Wow, thank you soo much😘 It Will help me a lot❤️
I use blower during the drying part to speed things up and its effective
Good tips, thanks!
With the over mixing thing I typically just let it dry on my little plastic palette and when I come back it’s good as new (idk about the tube paints though, so far I’ve only really used the ones in the pans)
I acually have a water color project for school so this will help alot
I was so uncomfortable watching you painting that skirt. seeing it fall apart piece by piece made me cringe so bad
Will these tips still be useful to watercolor brush pens or pencils,I use those instead
FUCKING PAPER MURDERS AAAAAAA
Quick question, Are all the tips in the video same for watercolour pencils? I use them instead and I just wanted to know so if u come across this comment plz answer my question 🥺👌
Why you put hole in daring it hurt meh! 😨😭
The fact that you use red paint while overworking the paper was..   *ahem*   Not so nice
Watercolor isn’t as hard as it seems once you find an easy way to paint and I just use normal paper and it’s easy and it doesn’t really do anything bad to it so I just do it
omg that dramatization lol I can't
Why did you make a hole in the girl with the red skirt’s penis?????? You could have done it somewhere else.... (JUST SAYIN’!) btw cool kinda
3:44 when u destroy her coochie
What brand of paint do you use it's all most x-mas for my and I've been painting with water color for a bit and I'm still trying to stock up so I want to get the good stuff
l really love your watercolor video which inspired me to try it! this vid was really helpful so thank you for making it.
I’m taking a painting class rn and we are focusing on water color, this and your other videos are really helping me make good artwork because our teacher hasn’t explained anything.
Hey kasey! Great video and very helpful! I just have 1 question. When I use watercolor, I usually sketch on the watercolor paper, then I outline it with an ink pen. But when I use watercolor, the watercolor mixes with the ink and makes a gross dark color! How do I prevent this?
I only use printer paper..... IM CHEAP AF BOOOII!! if you know any cheap brands of paper plz tell me! I'd wouldn't mind some water colour paper that's cheap ; )
the best watercolor related video I ever seen

You can buy water clout pencils
I’ve been watching you for so long and I actually got into watercolor because of you. I just want to say Thank you for inspiring me to try and experiment with new art supplies
I really could use your help on knowing how to do better on everything about art and i really want to become a good artist
No offence but on your videos why is your boyfriend so weird 😕😖
Going into town today and this video has inspired me to buy some watercolours, I already do acrylic but I was too scared to do watercolour haha
It is a relly heplfull and didactic video
I dry my brushes by *slapping the devil out of it*
Hi, do you have any recommendations for what watercolors should I use?
Can I use u create paper for water color
superduper
Definitely informative for a beginner like me, thanks for the awesome vid!
This really help me alot. Thanks for the tips! 🙏
3:58 I'm dying
if your too impatient on watercolor, don't try oil paint!! it takes even longer to dry.
Im a begginer, so thanks for the tips
Givve this comment a like if you think your art style reflects your personality
I actually lime the dry gradient more than the wet gradient. who else thought the same?
Can u make the biggest drawing on the biggest paper pls😔😔
My teacher showed this video during my art class.
3:42 NO STOP NOW. LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE THREW UP MOMS SPAGHETTI,U DIDN'T HAVE TO RUIN A DRAWING! COULD HAVE JUST DONE DAT ON SOME BLANK PAPER EW NOOO UGG NOO.
Kasey, when doing lineart do you use a regular pen, a marker, or something else?
So helpful!!! Thx!!!!!
Anyone else prefer the dry gradient over the wet one?
watching this as I'm painting with watercolors on printer paper
What about sketchbooks? Would that work for water color?
Do you add water on the paper first or do the wet on dry technique? O':
Awww thanks! I needed this for my school!
3:20 what is that brush u using
Me and my art skills doing team work:       Does the exact opposite of everything in the video.
Wow! Amazing! You are talented
4:00 That picture of the Owl girl in glasses with the bloody hole in her vagina is pure nightmare fuel.
can i use oslo paper or white card stock?
THAT POOR PIECE OF PAPER KASEY STOP ITS HURTING ME
Around about 03:50 physically hurt me... /Shudders. XD
WHY DO YOU SOUND SO MUCH LIKE AILEEN FROM REGULAR SHOW?!?!?!?😱😱 btw first time here love you already😊❤❤ keep up the good work!!!😊
Rip paper boi ???-???  Kasey ain't have to do all that
3:57 Had me dead
WHY DOES THAT CHARACTER HAVE A BIG NOSE ;—; ;—; ;—; ;—;
Thank you! <3 You're the best!
It looks like for owlina started her period.
This really helped me😃
Do you erase the sketch after coloring it? How do you erase your sketch after coloring it?
I love doing dry gradients because it avoids waste of paint lmao
How do you keep the paint inside the lines? XD
It took you 1 min. to explain me how to avoid those strokes....what our teachers NEVER told us...thy
Thank you so much ;u;
The showcasing of the overworking was painful to watch
I thought this was a sponsor or an ad for clorox
I just turned 13 and for my birthday, my dad got me a set of watercolors: the tube kind. Is that what you use? Also, I think I'm doing okay at watercolor because I've been watching your videos to see how you do it
I use oslo paper
What brand/type of pen do you use? I use whatever pen i have and even if i let it dry for a long time it still manages to bleed
This helped me soooo much
o
Kasey golden if u have enough time can u plz draw my oc i love ur art style so much!!!😍
Where can u find watercolour brushes and paint? I don't have those materials...and I really want to watercolor
What kind of water color do you use, mine is really light, with my water color pencils.
What marker/ pen/pencil do you use in those drawings. so you can get it wet without the ink bleeding? (also loooove your style and helpful video :D )
Fun fact : Put your brushes with the brush part up. If you don't, it will make the brush deformed (while drying) and it will be harder to use it. This also may include for the big ones, but this tip or fact is a bit more targeted to the small ones.
That was sooooooo helpful thanks a lot 😊😋😙
So i have a question, how do you avoid the water wrinkles when using water color?
3:52 this is making me suffer  Did it hurt making this part, kasey?
that poor bird girl's vajayjay
4:01 Periods.
What watercolors do you use?🤗❤
I am starting off with watercolor and I really recommend the Karutake Gansai Tambi pallette coz, boi, they are good! Just sayib, they are amazing for beginners like me! ❤🖌
Does anyone know a good (cheapish) brand of water colors for a beginner? I was using crayola but I was having trouble getting good colors out of it
The overworking could be used for bullet holes if you do it on the wrong side of the paper. That’d be neat.
HOW DO YOU GET SUCH AMAZING IDEAS!??😲😍
Along with these tips, one tip I would like to give is using mixed media. For example, adding colour pencils to a finished piece adds so much to it, or using white acrylic paint or ink for highlights. It really helps bring the painting to life.
I really really like kasey videos good job kasey ! ❤️❤️❤️😊
jesus christ the demonstration of rubbing the paper too much was painful XD
I started to learn water coloring and this video really helped😁😁   (I wasnt even know there was different kind of papers😂😂)
How do you keep your fine line so clear like the paint doesn't make the fine line look all merky
I've tired water colors a few times in the past and came out with TERRIBLE results, but i think i'm finally getting the hang of it. Whenever i mix too much color, i just leave it to dry and then use it the next time, and so far that's worked pretty well.
Dry looks better
Finally! I really needed that, thanks.
I watch and try and watch and try and I like watercolor but somehow it doesn't really work. Okay I have just really really really cheap watercolor supplies but I'm too stingy with my money when it comes to just experimenting.
Omg thanks for the tips it helped me so much
Can me crazy but I prefer dry gradients. Yeah, they’re hard to do but it’s so... *PIGMENTED*
3:43 OH NO WHYYYYYY
3:48   u  n  s  a  t  i  s  f  y  i  n  g
Keep painting
Do you have any tips for making smooth lineart? I've been drawing for YEARS so I'm no beginner, but my lineart is always shaky and uneven. I have a really shaky hand especially when my anxiety kicks in, and sometimes my lineart ruins the whole piece. I'm a perfectionist so a lot of the time I throw away my drawings because I'm frustrated that the lineart is so crappy.
super helpful
4:00 oh my
I am currently thinking about getting water colors so this is useful
I'm kinda afraid to ask if the owl girl was going through her period because the dramatization is real😅
Can you use charcoal paper for watercolor
3:48 the longer she rubbed the paper the more I cringed and felt bad for that drawing
4:01 . . Hardcore period
where do you get the watercolor brush pens? like what aisle?
If you want a certain color to be paler/lighter do u add more water to it? And if you want the color to be darker and stuff do u use less water?
4:00 when your period comes out of no where
What watercolour do you use??
I cried when you keeps on rubbing that paper huuuuuuuu
I just bought a mix-media sketchbook thing, 190 lbs. I had no idea what it meant but i like the texture and how thick it is. I do go a lot by texture and thickness, i have a scetchbook that has really weak and flimsy paper that i bought purly for the cover, love that gritty texture, good for pencil drawings but nothing else so i dont really use it..
tbh the overworked paper looks like it would be a great effect for gorey things, you know?
If you don't have water color paper you can glue multiple printer papers together and use that :)
3:49  poor girl bled through the paper during shark week
There's a way to get rid of that border. Wait for all of it to dry then the next day, paint over the border with water and blend the two together.
I was watching other tips and I thought "nah ill go to my watercolor mother for these tips"
The rubbing part made me have OCD so fastXD
3:59 when you start your period
I’m going to try all your advice 😁😁💕💕
Love your art style
The best part of watercolor is that you don't actually waste paint though, I've never worried about over mixing because i knew i could just pick it back up with water.
Does anyone know what to do to fix warping when using watercolors?
i loved this video you're very smart 💗💗
3:58 periods
I need a bigger variation of watercolor or a bigger watercolor pallet
Now I dont doubt the fact that i bought a new sketchbook (120g/m² paper) YAY.  LUVS YA KASEY GOLDSSS❤❤❤🐾
A good tip is you are impatient like me when it comes to watercolor drying is to use a blow dryer but hold it far away so the water doesn’t drip or smear.  It works well for me and I hope it works for you!
In my country they don't have watercolor paper so what to use ._.
Thank you fir these tips! I definitely learned some new things
I just recently started drawing digitally, and taking it seriously. I've been having a lot of fun with it. However, seeing your videos has been motivating me to give watercolor a go.  I love your work! Thank you for sharing <3
I can't buy watercolor paper...
oh that almost hurt to see you overly dramatic rubbinf that paper. Very good tips!
What fineliner do you use when you are working with watercolours? 😊
You should do a art supplies tour
Idk where to get water color paper
HOW DO U STAY INSIDE THE LINES IM SO BAF AT STAYING INSIDE THE LINES
Thank You, this helped a lot!❤️🙂  Edit: I’m getting my first set of watercolors tomorrow!!! (So Excited)
Tip number 6 is a big mood when I'm on my period. Red liquid driving a hole straight through my body 😂
Im only able to afford those Artist Loft Tube watercolor paints, and im having trouble figuring out how to make a decent skin color Without it looking too yellow or red and not mess up the line art. Any ideas? 😓
I got everything but i did what you said about the strokes (thats the only thing i need improvement on) and it didnt really work for me so i thought it was i added to little water so i added more and it didnt work and i kept trying and it didn work as well as i expected so i rate this vid 9/10   Jk i love this vid but im serous about the water color
Watch vexx and learn how to draw
4:01  Is she on her period? 😂
Did anyone else have to look away during the DRAMATIZATION
3:41-4:05 was extremely difficult to watch
you helped me a whole lot with the strokes
Could I use normal paints and add a little water to them in a little container when I paint
(If your a boy don't read this XD) 3:50 - 4:03 when your on your period...
Thank you! This really helped me!
I was like is that cold press paper and my art teacher is like how do u know and I was like.....Kasey Golden.
Thanks Kasey!
PLEASE HELP I use a .005 micron pen for my inking and allow it to dry completely but it still bleeds everywere!
Ugh THANK YOU! Why are other water color tips too complicated?! You made ut very simple.
I literally brought everything I needed to watercolor...except I forgot the watercolor😓
Thank you so much! I'm new at watercolor and this helped A LOT!!!
Omg I tried painting for the first time for like 8 years and it turned out kind of like I expected because I didn’t have right paper but I thought that it didn’t matter so much but now I see it matters and I’m so glad, I can paint! 😂
4:01 gave me physical shivers this is NOT okay Kasey no i do not approve, i do not care for your zombie-tastic ideas now i NEVER WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.
4:01 OMG i have period!!😱
Did 4:01 remind anyone of a period
here's a suggestion: after you wash your brush try putting vasline on the brush to keep it smooth and strong and leave it in till when you will use it again and before you dip your brush into the paint lightly wet it. i really reccomend it because i do it too and it helps with keeping my brushes good
3:45 How I feel when I think I’m bleeding through my pad...
oK SO WE HAVE LITERALLY THE SAME PEN HOLDER
my teacher was talking about watercolour and showed us some videos on how to watercolour she showed us yours and some of my friends were so happy to see this video in such a long time
so the watercolour paper I got recently is 280gsm (hot press maybe?) and it just sucks up all the watercolour as soon as I apply it. I mean it was cheap but is there aNy way I can stop it drying so quickly?
The hole on that piece oml haha
Your art is so cool 😍😍
Am I the only one who found that when Kasey continuously rubbed the brush on the paper to the point where it was coming off, was hilarious?
Da hot press paper gives it like a...digital art look. Btw, do u have a webtoon comic ◇^◇?  Ur lil character makes it seem so hehe
Very helpful!
I’m just starting on doing watercolor, glad I found your channel! Thank you for this useful tips! :)
" paper does fall apart" my emo ass: */THE FEAR OF FALLING APART/*
Around 3:52 I had a hard time breathing - liek,I don't even know it's probably because it's a cute piece and then *S U D D E N L Y*
3:55 This hurts me *so much*
"If you have brisels falling out of your brush it could be how you store them, you have to make sure there dry, if you leave them in water it could loosen the glue that holds the brisels and cause them to fall out."   Me: *Slowly turns head towards art desk and sees brushes in water which is where they've been for 2 nights*  Me: well F***  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 True Story!
i have no life
i have no friends
0:54 that could be useful if you have an oc with a stripe if they're an alien or another creature of some sort
so cool!
"Have patience" oh.. okay, I guess watercolors aren't for me. Jk but amazing video.
I love your channel because beside your undeniable skills, your commentary is just hilarious XD so entertaining to watch
I cringed when she drilled a hole through her drawing... I was like "Okay I get it, don't over work it ... you can stop now ... what are y- STOP! Jeez Kasey"
I'm just watching videos about things I don't have and probably won't get, water you doing
Cool
Is anyone gonna comment on how she was aggressively rubbing her brush against that character’s crotch? No? Just me?
Thx so much for the advice
what marker do you use for the base/structure (idk) of your drawing because most of the markers i use bleeds or smudges when i apply watercolours over it
When your art class only supplies sketch paper and cheap watercolors.Then they make you do full on pictures with details on that cheap paper. Only like 7 people have watercolors since we have so little funding. :,)
*I **-fuckin'-** love this*
What type of pen do you use for the outline
those moments when you thought you are a great artist until......
Can you use paper from a sketch book?
you know... I started to  make a style from your style! I really love the angled characters because it gives more expression that you can add rather than bubbled realism drawings. Im thinking in between an angled type of clothing and bubbly body or vise versa
And then i thought i was a good drawer
I looks like the green ball has an I patch
4:01 damn thats one hell of a period
Thank you for these tips, I definietely need to practice them ^_^
Your drawing style is very soft (if that makes any sense) I actually like it alot!
Paper falls apart, like me
thank lord.  i am in elementary school and heading to junior high. im signing up for 2d art class and i want to know how to use watercolors before i learn how to use watercolors so i look cool >:3 thx for dat .3.
These tips are amazing!!! thank youuuu
You:makes hole in drawing Me:it feels like you made a hole through my heart
Brush quality. I have the top tear brushis I  Have HOURSE HAIR brushis
Why is your paper so heavy
what water colors do you use?
Talk about acrylic paint
Very helpful tips. Thank you
😐 😟 😓 😨 😲 😭  *(@**3:56**) Like nails on a chalkboard, only to my eyes. Lol*
I like how you made your character sweating for hot press and shivering for cold press :]
Do I put water on the paper first or the brush
I forgot his name but if you take away the panda caribou things limbs then...   IT'S A POTATO
I love your style
This was really helpful! Thank you
What fineliner do you use with your paintings?
WARNING read if you are mature       4:00 PeRioD !!!
If you work fast enough you can actually rewet the watercolor but if you do this be careful and make sure there is the right amount of color
Dry looks better
Thx for the tip
First Tip: *Strokes and How to Avoid Them*
hey Kasey! I love your videos, you inspired me to start using watercolours! Keep up the good work! But i have a question, i have watercolour paper, but the paper still buckles, is that normal?
Please talk about stretching paper 🙏🏻
Real good!
Whats 140 LB? I am german and just know 300 gsm
Hey guys, remember when kasey had no ears?
I use that rough cheap sketchbook paper
Hi Casey,  This is my first viewing of one of your videos and I enjoyed it very much and subscribed.  I'm a real beginner at this, though I paint in oils all the time.  You answered many questions here and I'll be watching your other videos.  Can you tell me how to prevent the blooming (blotching?) that happens.  I'm quite unsure of how much water to use.  I've mainly done dry painting to avoid this, but I really do like the blending that happens wet on wet.  Thanks for any reply.
These r sum some helpful tips 👌
That painting you rubbed a hole into was so good I was so shocked when you ruined it 😢 (Lovely vid tho! These are tips I really needed because I've been struggling with some of these problems and you explain it very well)
The part where you overworked the paper was amusing to me,   It looked like period blood 😂
4:00 how you feel on your period XD
Plz tell meh the best and cheapest watercolours you use pleaze
What kind of color is use in skin? (sry for my english)
*W E T*
3:42 period be like
I needed to regenerate my healt because I just watched bts cracks and I’m wheezing. Thank you.
Thx Kasey Golden!
You can use a hair dryer to speed up the dry time
Do 7 Drawing tips ;-; pls
I love your videos so much, I really like your style and the way that you work makes me want to practice drawings even more cwc, thanks :3  P.s. the place where you dig the hole in the skirt at 4:00 is very, very awkward. It even "bleeds" on the other side LMAO
whats the QOR watercolours that u listed in ur materials
Thanks love your drawing n' styles ....
I perfered cold press
ه
This is probably the video i have watched the most like continuously
You like a koala
*DRAMATIZATION*
please.... what is the tip number five ?  i don't understand  (because is english)
Thank you very much for this video
3:55 😭
It looks  like  a  panda mixed with a moose
i wish inking drawings was easy ;-;
3:49 😫😫💔
We were working with watercolors in a tray in 6th grade. There was a girl that i was friends with and now she was in my art class. There was drama between us. Thats when i am cleaning up and applying water to my ehite paint, to clean it from the pastel blue i had used for my sky. I turn over to her to put my paint back in the front and what do i see? SHES SLAMMING HER PAPER AGAINST THE PAINT TO CLEAN IT WTFFF im just staring at her like tf r u doing, when she asks 2 girls at her table to get her paper towels. She takes her paper off the paint to use the paper towelsmy god it was a mess, she ended up getting me and my art teacher staring at her, when i sat down, and my art teacher says, "Next time, dont waste the paper like that, go clean your desk the bell is gonna ring "
I recently moved to watercolor so this helped me a lot 😊
Hi , just wanted to know which pen do use for inking .
4:01 me when I’m on my period
2:16 *BRUSLES*
How do you paint in the liness😭
I use cold press I like it better
I use the same brushes but for some reason the wood on some of them broke off... :/
I wish I saw this video before school today. I was on art class, and the project I was working on required me to use water colors. I haven’t really used them before, except messing around with the cheap ones that aren’t very good when I was little. I managed to literally mess up everything you said in the video, except overworking the paper. Luckily it isn’t a big deal as I used it minimally and it is the opposite of the main part. Thanks anyways, and I really hope this will help me get into watercolors!
3:50 Nooooooooooo!!!!!!! Don't ruin the skirt!!!!😢
omg, thank you so much  this helped me with my art contest   recently.. ty <3 3
3:43. AAAHHH NOOOOOOOO     Great vid btw :3
Ty !! ;3
I was literally just wondering if there was a video for this
i really needed this as a beginner,, thanks!!
OK. I checked the QOR watercolors on amazon. 78$ CAD for 12. frickin. colors. Maybe I'm just cheap, but HECK NO I won't buy this until I get a job lmao I like buying clothes better :-P
I just found this Channel And I'm in love
whenever i add water, it get's really out of control and is just a huge blob of water, i just want my paintings to be really light and soft but i can't do it with the giant blob of water, help?
People: Where is my Pencil? Me: WHERE IS MY HB2 PENCIL?!
Finally a unhelpful youtube artist that doesn't  do anime
Happy new year everybodyyyy
The first one looks like A eyepad
Wow im glad i watched this video this helped me learn a bit!
I’ve the vid! But what pen/liner do you use for your work?
How do u know when there is enough water and not enough
Ummmmm,what if I use art block paper??? Is it acceptable???
I just like every type of drawing style there is, I like sketching, paint, coloring, water color,  I love it all but the one I use the most would probably have to be digital art.
yes  boiiii
Thank you! I just used my watercolors for the first time and these are excellent tips :)
Now that's what I call a terrible period 4:00
This is very helpful thank you. The tips are some what obvious but this is kind of a reminder
This really helped me thanks!
My art teacher says that printer paper is waterpaper.        I regret taking that class...
I just discovered you. Your art style is amazing! Thank you for those tips :)
3:58 why there
TIME TO GO TO THE STORE!  place one: darn, they only have printer paper Place two:oppp it's closed Place three (Michael's): WHY DIDNT I GO HERE BEFORE
What size micron pens do you use?
The owl girl looks like Neiress(can’t spell) th cute from camp csmp
0:49 how to make an eyepatch
Thank you for the tips!
I use every thing you use cause I seeeeeeee         Not creepy at all! :D
what kind of brush do you use (what brand)
I just got water colors and everytime i use them on my multi-media paper, it curls up and makes little paper bits, so thanks for the tip!
I don't know if it's the watercolors I use, but whenever I try to do a wet gradient the colors just mix into each other at the slightest contact. It won't even be super wet and they just mix themselves without any effort.
You just look like frisk in undertale XD
this is very helpful!! thank you so much!
Aw man I need to do an assignment but I really wanna do some watercolour now
Thank you so so much! I've been wanting to get into watercolor and I had no luck until now! These tips really helped. Thanks a billion!
Anyone know what type of paint she uses?
4:00 ..... you did not...
4:05 I love that drawing more than I care to admit
For the first one just use a refillable water brush which is like the best invention EVER!!
Am I the only one who felt the pain when she rubbed the paper toooo hard😬😂
i laughed too hard when you over dramatically rubbed a hole into the paper-
We watched this in my art class! It was helpful.
Thank you!
3:59 period :)
What brand of pens do you use to outline your pieces? All of the pens I've tried smudge when I add the watercolor.
holding people back hehe shawn mendes
What brand of watercolors do you use?
Could you  try watercolour pencils pls
my biggest issues with watercolor are the paint bleeding outside of where i want it, and the watercolors bleeding with the liner.
but then my teacher is stupid enough to say "Oh ItS wAtEr CoLeR! iT Is SuPpOsEd To Be StReAkY"
4:00 omg my eyes r dying
Thanks.
Do you use pans or tubes?
Where do you usually get the water colour paper? Is it sold in stationary shops or artsy shops? I'm wondering.
My sketches are good and all and colouring in with markers and pens is quiet easy for me but when it comes to watercolours and acrylics i fail so bad im sure a 5 year old can do better than me but i really like watercolours so i guess im just gonna have to keep on trying ^_^
You have no idea how helpful this is! (Well maybe you do, that was the point of the video) But I am pretty garbage at painting and watercolor is the easiest for me to use, but I am extremely uneducated! I've been seeing so many beautiful watercolor drawings, like yours, on Instagram and have been wanting to try for a while! So thanks for the helpful tips!
4:58 getting ur period unexpectedly like
The dry gradient looked better though +~+
can anybody tell me how to NOT smudge the ink? everytime i water colour, the inking smudges like crazy, and bleeds into the paint, and makes it look really  bad. id appreciate  some help!
*I still can't draw*
I kinda liked the dry gradient better lol
This is really good advice! I really wanted a way to color my drawings. I honestly always thought of water colors as unprofessional, but you have convinced me otherwise.
at 3:58 it looks like tamtoe sauce
I almost had an aneurism while you rubbed the paper raw 😂
Thank you! I really wanted to start learning water colours so this was helpful!
I have used watercolours for years, and I came to see if there was anything I'd missed from being self taught. I didn't find anything new but I found brilliant video to teach newbies. Great as always Kasey! 😄
Thank goodness i subbed to ya cause right now i have watercolors
How bout tick normal paper??
I just asked my mother to get me watercolors! I’m going to get them soon and I’m glad I happened to come across this video!  Also, I don’t know what type of paper I have, but it looks similar to the cold press paper you showed in the video, so I’m just hoping that my sketchbook paper will be able to handle watercolors
Pro tip: with watercolors if you let your mixed paint DRY in the pallet you can reuse it, so you're not wasting paint.
4:00 on what place you made that hole? (lenny face)
Like your table
i like cold press + hot press paper best
Will you also do a video talking about your supplies you use and that you like
Thanks Kasey! This was a big help with my coloring and I LOVE the water colors that you use! I just bought them and they work great!
They help a lot
Will you do more of these
Thanks for the amazing video! These are incredibly useful tips, I've been trying to get into watercolours since they were never something I was good at.  P.s. tfw you fuck up the hand orientation feels bad (I'm talking about the drawing on the hot press paper, the right hand (our left) is a left hand... but it's on the right arm... ye)
Your so good at drawing
I have the Michaels Artist lofts water color markers and i say i would like to move on to more better brands
Thank you!
3:46 I think you´re good now  3:52 Okay..  3:57 O k a y  3:58 *A L R I G H T*  4:00 cries
thanks a lot!
I have a question :c someone knows what materials she use to make the line art? Sometimes I use markers or pens and turns in to a mess :/
Hi
3:43 Rip Owlina
My paper is only 90 lb. Shiat.
what is a good pen to use to outline the drawing first before water colouring?
Love it art style
that border looks so artistic? wow
Overbrushing.. that's totally me.😑😑 i must need more patience in my life.
Thank u so match for these tips this really helped me inprive
*4:00** It looks like she had her period! XD*
Im pretty bad at watercolours, I don't know why its just that my drawings become really textured,and it always turns out really messy. I just love this type of videos that help whit that. Thank u❤
omo i'm one of those people that get frustrated and ruin the brush
4:00 woah girl haven't you done enough
Can you do a face reveal?
My....ocd.........it..it...was mad
Kasey collab with Kesh please :))      (Kesh needs friends you know :P )
Is Sketchbook and watercolor paper different?
Great tips!  Thank you!
Thanks!! Helped a lot!! :)
Personally, When I paint, I use cardstock. 😀 It works great.
oh shit i could not look at the paper being destroyed by pressing too hard ><
i bought watercolor paper butt it still crumbles
Cool
Watercolours are cool but they're a hassale because they take too long. I usually use gouache watercolours or markers because they dry fast
Wow you grew from 1k to 111k really quick! When I first started watching your videos I was frustrated that you didn't have more subscribers because you definitely deserved to. This video is really helpful however (dumb question alert) I always struggle to mix paint. whenever I try to introduce new colours they just get absorbed into my brush and then when I clean the brush to get a different colour... so much paint is wasted. this makes it really hard to mix big quantities of paint. I would really appreciate if you could help out answering this
I use XL watercolor paper. And I use koi watercolors
Honey, the overworking of the paper was not an exaggeration
4:01 is how I feel on my period
Do you know what else you can use as support for painting watercolor? *Passe-partout material!*  It has great consistency, so hard that rarely warp, but so soft at the surface that works with watercolor. Even if you think it will be so expensive to buy, you can ask for *leftover material* in the marquetry shop (frame shop). Result of cutting frames, they abound too small squares that are no longer useful for cut again, but are perfectly okey to paint small watercolor illustrations..! You will get a finished artwork ready to give or hang. *Source: My father as marquetry worker* Wish you luck!
This is very useful I love it!😍
That dramatization hurts
I also personally prefer cold press as well
What about water color pencils
This is really helpful! I'm going to use watercolor to learn a new medium during a project for my art class, and I'll definitely do my best to keep these tips in mind!
What waterproof pen did you use???
I was so distressed by tip 6 that was overworking the paper overkill oh gosh 😭 but these tips are very helpful!!
Wet is better
Everyone is awesome here!!!
When she was rubbing her wet brush on the paper and constantly making it worse I felt so uncomfortable and angry 😂
I'm jealous... I am an artist but I can't get any ideas for the drawing I'm going to do... Also the color scheme bothers me a lot since I don't color my drawings often
Do u need to add water to the water colors
I've tried watercolours a few times, and the product usually turns to an average. Mostly because I use cheap watercolours like Crayola, BUT, Hey! I'm using the things I have because I'm poor af :")
why did i watch this knowing im never going to use watercolor  TvT
What type of pen do you use?
How are you painting​ with watercolor? I have watercolor pencils, so...
I adore your Channel Icon person.  Reminds me of Windwaker.
Yo in bad side for tip 1 is so good for like sewn together parts like for zombies and other things *0*
I use water color pencils and i don't know about anyone else who uses water color pencils but it hard to do dark colors because the colors always show up very light. :(
That overworking demonstration really drained me ;A; ahh that poor drawing was pretty
I want to do watercolor properly so badly now, I only have these watercolor markers :c
You are sooooooo talented! I learned a loooot of things from this video! Thanks! 😃😄😁😍😋🤗
Your tip videos (and all your videos) are so clear and concise! Thanks for all your help :)
@4:00 hahahahahaha you know what I mean...
Id say that hotpress actually dries faster, the little dips in the texture of the coldpress allows for the paint to dry slower around the edges, its more difficult to get a flat wash on hotpress than cold. The time you have to work on coldpress is longer as well :) great video!
is there a HOT PRESS watercolor paper???
You make me waaaaaaaaay to happy
I've used watercolors for several years already but I stopped using them for a while because the colors were always bleeding out, there were always visible strokes and such, but now that I've watched this video, I kinda want to use em again. Thanks a lot for these tips!
Yay thank you for the tips this really helped me with my watercolor skills
Wow your tips are amazing! I just subscribed!
I'm so thankful for this video! Thank you so much!
What do you use for lining your work? And you line it before you start painting? : o  I'm trying to figure out what'd be the best way to go about doing this-- lining before or after I get the watercolors down.
That poor girl with the shirt looks like she got shot in the jungle region..
Lowkey thought that border was like an eyepatch
Thx 4 da tips
Do you use watercolor pencils or paints?
What paper do I use
I love paints! Both watercolor and acrylic.however, the watercolors I use are so wet to the point where I can't control my paints. How to avoid that?
Oh god... watching you scrub a hole all the way through the paper was so painful!! Drives the lesson home, but yikes
3:52  Okay, u right, but how satisfying does that look?
2:16 B R U S S L E S
Will cardstock work?
Why don't you erase your pencil lines after your done inking?
I have watched this 7 times since I'm getting watercolours and I must remember
What are qor watercolors? plese! Am i stupid
! English is not my first language !    How you make that anatomy ? I notice that lines but i can't really get it 😅 how you know where start ? - sorry if you can't understand what i mean haha.. 😂😂
Learnt so much in 5 minutes, Thank you!
as soon as i saw your style of drawing, immediately fell in love with it! it's just so angular, and cool, just reminds me of "danger and eggs" ( a show i like a lot) subscribed!
Is there much difference from water colour pencils and water colour brushes?
Thanks for the great ideas, especially storing my brushes :) That was the one and very important that I did not even think about until now :) really helpful :)
Questions:  1.) Do you prefer coloring+illustrating men or women?  2.) Do you prefer coloring+illustrating Humanoids or Animals?  3.) When did you develop your style of art?  4.) Do you have siblings?  5.) What is your favorite color?  6.) Who was or is your largest supporter of your art (besides us, subscribers)  7.) Not a question, but I find your art amazing, and cute. Also I love your voice.  ----Some random 12 year old----
you were digging through that paper :0
I'm thinking of using water color
When she rubbed a hole through that awesome piece of art work I wanted to jump off a cliff lmfao it was so pretty I'm so sad
Great video with amazing tipps! I didn´t do watercolor in a while again. . even if I wanted to! Okay I did a bit more then normally, but its such a love hate relationship between us :D like I LOVE how it looks etc, but it drives me crazy how much I have to fight with it sometimes :D
i think the strokes/borders are called "hard edges" :-)
OMG I SUGGESTED THIS HHHHHHHHH
If you're impatient with waiting for paint dry just get a heatgun ^-^ makes life a little easier
How do you fill in the colors so perfectly? I use a small brush but the paint still comes out of the outline.
Thank you for the tips! Watercolor look like so much fun but I'm quite hesitant when it comes to coloring since I don't want to ruin my pieces ;__;  That's why I moved to drawing digitally...it's easier to go back on mistakes~  But I'll try watercolor, it looks really nice and smooth.
Just found your channel, your watercolors are insane! Have you ever done a coffee challenge? would be awesome to see
Out of all of the videos about, "Tips about watercolor!" Yours is the most simple, but the most effective. You genuinely make sense compared to other videos and you give cut-and-dry tips that anyone could use! I genuinely didn't know the difference between cold-press and hot-press (other than texture) until after this video and I've been using watercolor for the past 3 years. Thank you!
3:47 rubbing that part 😂😂😂😂
This video is super helpful! Thank you. ☺
OMG KASEY! YOU'RE CHANNEL IS GROWING SO MUCH! YOU ARE ALMOST AT 100K SUBSCRIBERS! IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU! YOU TOTALLY DESERVE THIS!
I love your art so much! You inspire me so much! You are my idol💕💕
When you were talking about not wearing down your paper I was screaming at my laptop for you to stop... seeing it wear down is so depressing :(
OH im the last one
Watching you punch through that paper made me hurt... i was internally screaming 'PLEASE STOP OMG'
Woah that was actually pretty helpful ❤️
Lol you got so much subscribers so quickly, last time I saw you, you only had like 30k subs and that wasn't even a month ago
Legend says that Kasey Golden will, heart, reply, and pin your comment . Once every 300 years
If you are reading this I hope you have a wonderful day. Pass this on to make someone else's day. Have a cookie 🍪🍪🍪
Incredible!
I've tried wAter colors once, HAhA, And and i didn't work out well At All!!  mY colors bled into eAch other And it wAs just Awful.  It kind of mAde me A little scAred of wAtercolors for A while.  But recentLy I've been wAnting to trY out new things, including wAtercolor, so this video reAllY helps!!  ThAnk You!!  ^^  ((Oh Also I love Your stYle it's super cute And Your Art is gr8 m8))
I started cringing a bit when you were painting the red skirt too hard. Great video though!
thank you!!! i was thinking of buying watercolours recently and this should be super helpful!
Haha, this is perfect timing because i just started my watercolor journey today with my brand new mixed media sketchbook! Thanks for the tips!
What brushes do you use? They always seem to be angled
Can you do someting like this for lines (with a fineliner or other kind of pen) because my lines are not good
Do you use watercolors that r in a tube or a pre made palette thing
Ah no, the poor drawing!
I have a challenge for you! Draw something about Brazil! Buuut you can't Google it! I'm Brazilian and I really like to see it! Bye
oh my lord thank you so much! just yesterday i got my first batch of water colours because i saw how you did it so i got my own!
I was just about to get my watercolors out before I saw this!!
This video was uploaded at the right time! I am just getting used to watercolors :)Thanks for your helpful advice!
I love watercolors sooo muchhh  I have just those knd of capsule cheap watercolors but it works for me (for now)
I notice me watching your videos nevertheless if I'm really interested or not 😅(by no means I mean this offensive! in this case I'm just no newbe to watercolors XD). It's because I really like how you create them. I think your speech is great, structured and your voice is relaxing to listen to. Also your style is very lovely. It's so relaxing watching your videos and I can highly recommend this one also to not-total-beginners in watercolor. Keep those great videos up! ☺️
I did your drawing challenge❤please check it out
4:01 What it feels like being on your period.
O ME GAWD UR GROWING SOOOOO FAST IM SOOOOO PROUD UR AWESOMMEEEE
Your DRAMATIZATION cracked me up.  Loads of good tips in this video, though!
.
Niceee now I can finally use watercolours properly :D
What about if my watercolor paper warps whenever I try to erase it?
My question was not answered.🤔🤔🤔     How come when I ink then add the watercolor this makes the ink outline bleed. And when you do it your lines are perfectly CLEAN. What?!?! How?! Do u even... 😑😑😑
Whenever I watercolour, my line art in always bleeds into the watercolour and makes it go brown :(. How can I avoid this? Is it just the pen I'm using?
My heart is aching when you rub the brush so hard the paper's breaking 😂
I've started watching your videos yesterday and I can definitely say that this is one of the few channels that are hard not to subscribe to.
This was so helpful! Thanks so much
I just got watercolors cause i wanted to try to pick it up again and this is so helpful ❤️
I saw this just after doing my first watercolour that I actually liked!!! It's definitely given me a lot of insight on how to continue watercolour and improve it a lot too :) Thanks
4:00 ME WHEN IM ON MY PERIOD 😂 sorry this is so weird but i think it's hilarious
89K oH WOW
can you do a real time water color.... i know that sounds a bit LONG but i would love to see it.
4:00 a good representation of a period 😂
Do you use promarkers?
Hello Kasey, I was wondering, for one of your videos could you explain how you created your original characters and  I've been to nearly every end of YouTube and I have found some good videos explaining how to make an oc you are very talented in the way you explain things so I would like to see how you would explain this subject. Creating an oc (for me) is extremely hard because 1) I still am trying to find my style and 2) I have no idea where to start or what to look for in my oc. Thank you for is amazing video, I just started to get back into watercolour thanks to you -Tyler M
Does anyone know other youtube channels that have content similar to this? I love watching her doing line art and watercolour
Hey Kasey! May I ask, is watercolour just paint but mixed with water? I use watercolour pencils and it doesn't give off the visual appeal that your art does! ^^
kasey to 100k wooooooooo
i only have normal paper dang it i just won't put too much water
I was hoping you'd also go into the pens you use. Do you only used the micron pens? What other pens are good for watercolor, are there some pens (and watercolors) to absolutely avoid when starting out?
Yes! I've been trying way too hard.. I'm cringing at myself.. :/
seeing u scrub into the paper w the brush made me cry
I would really like to see some of the pallet mixing in a video.
what watercolours do you use? they seem like really good ones.
Lmao. The character on the over worked paper seems to notice the hole in her skirt..
Please Do A Video On Shadowing Please X3
Can you make a video on color mixtures?  Such as colors or pigments that you use for various skin tones and how you shade them! This video was really helpful as I am soon going to begin using watercolors and I hope you can make a little series out of this.
oh shit she had a period all the way through the paper!
**grabs my water colors** we meet again old friends...     LETS MAKE SOME FRIGGIN ART!!!
The fact that you kept rubbing after the paper already kept coming off 😩😩😭😂 one of my pet peeves
Love your style.  It's simple and I find it cute. I love that you do watercolor illustrations, searching watercolor is actually how I found you. I've been binging on your videos.
Thanks for making this! I absolutely suck at watercolor lol. This was really helpful :D . Great video as always <3
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
I felt so much pain watching you tear a whole thru that paper! It felt so...wrong!!
T H A N K   Y O U  for this!!!
Thx I want to learn water color
Brustles? You mean bristles?
I've just begun using watercolour and the whole time i watch and rewatch your videos, i was looking through your channel yesterday for a tutorial or tips, what timing! Also lve your art and your style, keep working because all your subscribers love you! ❤️
If you want a challenge can you do a cheap water colour video?please?
You know that Find Waldo booklet, where you spend hours finding things, and also those I spy books, you should draw a bunch of ant pictures, and make it a find Waldo, I spy booklet
Perfect timing! i just got watercolors so this is just great :D thank you!
How do you get inside such small lines? It's hard for me to do it--
I know this has nothing to do with the video, but how about for the 50th drawing prompt (#50) you could draw all of your favorite types of ants. Like Black crazy ants, fire ants (red ants/tropical/solenopsis) ants, yellow crazy ants, jungle ants (ants with long mandibles, they're called jaw breakers on ants Canada), and a bunch of other ants that you like design wise. Since you're kinda into ants right now I think it would make sense for #50 or #40...or #12,000 you could draw EVERY ANY TO EVER EXIST. Lol no you'll stop #500 right? So maybe you could do that favorite 10 ants plus all the other 490, as like a finale.
T H A N K  Y O U
If you can’t afford watercolor paper, you can use gesso on lower weight papers. It is only a slight fix since you can’t layer too much or else lift up the gesso.
It kind I looks like owlina  (I'm sorry if I butchered her name) is having a really bad period
I SWEAR SHE HAD 80K YESTERDAY.
can you draw a hedgehog pls lol
Hi
I'm early pin this comment for good vibes be basic!!!!!!
87k.... How did this happen? Back at 7k and u were so small 🐢
Watercolour paper is like a person. It comes off as strong and are better than some other papers but it's not invincible. It falls apart too. <3 Loved the video Kasey.
I recently just found your channel and I love it! I do art as well and when I'm not motivated I go to look at other peoples art, and I landed here! Keep it it up! I love your art style!
i definitely want to try this tips next time i use watercolors <3 your use of them inspires me so much!!
You are one of my biggest inspirations ever!!! You might think your art is simple but it defiantly shows way more talent!   Also these tips are goals! Cause I've been needing them💙
YESS I JUST GOT MY WATER COLOUR SENT
Thanks for these tips kasey! I love the things you draw, whether it's the creatures or people :)
You should give tips for shading!! Pleaseeee
HELPED ME!!!!!!!!
8. erase sketch lines before painting if you don't want them there you can't erase them after
(Hmmm, I wonder what type of watercolors you use...)   (P.s. Great artwork btw)  Edit: oh wait nvm I just found out)
Henlo
Thank you so much!!! This was so useful!!!!
I love your style. It inspires me to improve my art. I'd love to see Over the Garden Wall fan art
THX A BUNCH THIS VIDEO REALLY HELPED ME OUT I AM A BEGINNER IN WATER COLOR I WISH I CAN BE LIKE U ONE DAY YOUR SOO GOOD AT WATER COLOR I LIKE DRAWING AND PANITING IBAM JUST A 10 YEAR OLD GIRL THAT JUST DOES GAMING VIDEOS!
i want to start drawing but i dont know where to start can u please make a video about that?
Wow you gained subs fast          Congratulations
I use mix media paper but it still bends?
am i the only one who finds her painting so satisfying 😍
Thank you, I was planning on getting watercolors soon so this will help me
wow, i definitely did not know about the brush thing! nice video :D
Maybe silly question but would like a clothesline type of thing work as well for drying the brushes? (bristles pointed downwards)  I have some cute little clothes pegs with ladybugs on em that I maybe could finally put to good use like this xd
That paper scrubbing was so satisfying to watch.
Are you doing a 100 k special next week😁
You have no clue how much I needed this video. I've been trying for years to master watercolors and I could never do it until now. Thanks!
Here's my number one tip for coloring: don't unless your framing it, posting it, or selling it
Is this a reuplode? I mean I know it is you in the video but im 100% sure I saw at least the part around 3:45 before... O-o
Great tips coupled with great art! This is a very enjoyable video to watch, thank you for taking the time to make it. :D
This came so in handy. I just bought my first set of watercolor paint and had absolutely no idea how they worked. Thank you, you saved a lot of illustrations.
Thank you for this video!! These tips are really helpful!
I can't believe you just made this, I was looking for videos to watch while using water colors for the first time  :o
face reveal?
im really happy to see this, it is really helpful! im trying to get more into watercolors since i got a set of watercolors, i had the problem with style like im sure that my art style is pretty much animuu ugh im trying to get a mire cartoony one, yours with varios other artist are now part of my inspiration in art style thank you for existing q o q <3
Its like you knew I just bought a water color set       CONSPIRACY THEORY
YAYAYAYA
I learned so much from this thanks!
How it feels when you're on your period lol 4:01
Best advice is to not use art loft
I was filming a video a couple of days ago and i litteraly kept making the mistake of not waiting long enough causing the colours to blead into each other :(
AAAAAAA YEET
Thank you! I plan to get into watercolours soon
The paper is rawww
Great Video Dude! :3
Hi!!!
Congrats on 85k you really inspire me to make my own videos ! Also this was incredible love ya x
I needed this video.
What kind of pen should i use for lineart? Because the ones I'm using right now, bleed into the paper a little
I wonder how you must've felt while destroying the owl lady as an example 😅😂
You are the reason I started watercolor
Oh wow, okay. I was watching your videos today and thought that it'd be cool to try using watercolors again but didn't know any tips and tricks about it...and then you upload this life saver! Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with us,  I think this is what I needed to try it out again. :)
уσυя νι∂єσѕ αяє αмαzιиg! ωє иєє∂ тσ gєт υ тσ 1 мιℓℓισи ѕυвѕ¢яιвєяѕ!!!
This was sooo helful because im a beginner artist and im trying new mediums so yeah i was trying watercolor but i was not really getting it ya know...so ..thanks 😃
I've been watching you since 17k so only a week, wtf!! How are you growing so fast! Whatever, congrats!!!!
Wow. You posted this the day after I looked up a bunch of tutorials on water coloring for beginners. Out of all the videos, this one was the most useful one!   Also, just a quick question: Are you going to be participating in this year's Inktober?
Water colors are for me the worst ;-;  Im sorry -n- But still good video ❤
Can you make a part 2 of prompt 30 but not a prompt just a painting video? I liked it so much ! And you enjoyed it too! Why not than 🌟🐱
Great tips Kasey! It's actually better to hang your brushes to dry upside down before you store them upright. If you're working on a piece where you're switching brushes, it's better to rinse the brush and set it on its side (like you mentioned) before you come back to it. I don't have a proper drying rack for me paintbrushes so I just use a hair elastic on the towel bar in the bathroom. 👍 Works wonderfully. 😊 Also, congrats on your fast growing following! You've gained thousands so quickly this past week! Love your videos and characters. They're so whimsical and fun. x
Thank youu!!! ♥️
03:41 Oh jeez. Oh god. Ow. Owwww...This made me feel physical pain.
My literal savior
I have watched so many watercolor tutorials that I shoud be a real pro in it       I'm not
rip owlina
I was JUST thinking: "Hm, maybe I should try something with watercolours?", and you made this video THANK YOU, it's at the right time!💜💜💜
Hi kasey I just started watching your vids you are sooo amazing .You are an inspiration to me .You inspired me to get off my phone and start water colour painting .It is soooo relaxing,fun and I feel you can never make a mistake it always works out as the best part of the painting.i love you and if you actually read this I hope you can carry on making funny,inspiring,entertaining and fun vids xoxo your number one fan (Alissa)
What I have been waiting for! Thank you so much ❤
VERY THANK
do avideo on your style! it is so awesome
This is perfect timing! I just got started watercoloring and these were so helpful! TYSM for uploading this, I have been wanting to become an artist and i absolutely love making art you are definitely one of my inspirations and someone who got me into using water colours and you helps me so much with my art block just by watching your videos! It dosent seem like it but you have done a lot for me and i appreciate it :)
Casey I sketch really hard on my paper and it's really ugly when I colour over It....do you have any advise on how to stop this?   Thank u😙
The amount of times Ive tried to get into water colors is endless...but im really inspired by the way you use it. with that said, gotta discipline myself to get into it. gonna start chipping away at it. Love your vids btw :)
Kasey !
*Have you ever used ink & have some tips? I want to have the best Inktober Ever. I would really appreciate the advice*
That hole in the paper made me feel sad :c
I really like the flat clean look watercolors give but it definitely seems to have a huge learning curve.   Btw Did Owlette's ovaries explode?! 😲
*Have toy ever used ink & have some tips? I want to have the best Inktober Ever. I would really appreciate the advice*
Mmmm that hot press finish is so nice. Im starting to think we are quite opposite on a lot of creative stances, heh.   The overworking of the paper, though... that's just grotesque.
I needed this! Thank you!!
Thank you for making this video... it really helped me.. ❤👍👍🐻
Spacy Kasey never ever lazy.
I can't draw with watercolor is only i can't D:<
i have been binge watching your videos for past few days and you inspire me to do watercolor so much but its quite intimidating so this video is really handy 🤗
I use Canson Mixed Media paper, and when i use my watercolors on it, it curls up at the corners, what did i do wrong?
.... I guess the time has finally come....  I must try using Watercolours
Really useful! You always inspire me to draw and I even started watercolors because your art inspires me so much💕❤️
Thank you so much! I was just about to watercolour for the fist time and then BOOM! perfect timing!
You da best :D i love how you draw i hope you never cange your self and how you draw. Ps can you draw a Waffle that would be awsome and If you do thanks :3
aaa ive been wanting to get into watercolor for awhile now, but i was worried that i'd screw it up.  This video was very helpful!
Poor Owlet looks like someone shot her in her skirt D:
Thank you this helped me a lot
It hurt me watching her make a hole in one of her drawings.
OH MAHGERD I NEEDED THIS THANK YOU SO MUCH
aaa i really wanted to practice more with water color so thank you for this video !! :D
!!!Thanks for another great video!! This one helped me the most
Great video
These videos are so high quality. Why aren't you more popular?
Wow this is such a coincidence! I only JUST started watching you the other day and thought about maybe trying watercolor myself! I'm more of a marker and digital artist. But I was thinking on how I could get to the same kind of quality as you! Thanks!!
Ahh I was just drawing and this pops up. Thanks!
Omg thank you so much! I always got frustrated when it came to watercolours :D
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
Thank you!!! I really needed tips
