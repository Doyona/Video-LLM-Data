You should have stained the edges before assembly
great job looks great
So I know this has been a couple of years since you built this but I have a question or 2: 1) How did you attach the table to the legs? 2) How did you attach the center support beam to the members on the leg supports?
Does it work?
The table looks killer but can you answer me how did you secure table top to the base I didn’t see that in your video.
Dang. You could park a car on that table
Nice job mate
That is a super beefy base. Definitely doing something like that for my build.
Stain is for cheaters. If you don't like the color of the wood choose a different wood species.
The end product is perfect
I am going to build a table like this. I like the simple legs but I think I would have put the pressure treated wood through a thickness planer to get rid of most of the green. I have two planks for the top of my table, they are 2 1/2 inches  thick, 13 1/2 inches  wide and 19 feet long.  Cutting the planks in half will give me  a dining table a bit over 9 feet long. Good work on your table Naftali Rosenthal, Thanks
Nice.
Please tell us the table full length  and breadth in detail
WoW ! Nice idea ! I tried https://www.amazon.com/bluekeyworld Cable Clips and it helped  my organization
Can you make a cut list for your table base
It's good to see the woodprix has new Instructions to save my money and energy to build it.
I know you can get solutions for that on woodprix.
Any reason why you didn't wedge the cross bars on the end so they would be flush with the legs rather than trimming them with a circle saw? I plan on modifying your design for a desk top that's going to have a cabinet on top.
the bolts are super ugly why not dowels? other than that it looks pretty decent and beefy!
What is the width of the legs and the 4x6’ you used for the horizontal members?
This is an awesome table. Thanks for sharing this.
Probably shouldn't have used a pressure treated 6x6.  This is only for outdoor use.  Nasty chemicals.
I'm gonna make this out of walnut. Do you have plans?
What did you use to attach the legs to the table top?
How did you attach table top to base of the table, and what are the dimensions?
Were you following a set of plans? If so can you please share them? I need measurements and a walk through with details. Thanks.
Nice beefy table! Simple build and the box stores want 3k for that! Excellent job 👍
I hate how he keeps sucking air between his teeth after every sentence
👍
Nice
Wow I'm so impressed my husband know how to make things from scratch but too lazy to do so LOL
I need to buy that table or make one and sell it to me🙏
Surprise surprise, you did it on the cheap.
Good work 👍
Great table! You did an awesome job man! I am actually about to go to home depot and grab some wood for more of my projects! Now i have another awesome idea in mind!
Hey Naftali, I love this table you made. And I’m planning on making it. I have a few questions. 1-How did you join the cross center beam? 2-what size did you cut the legs? 3-how did you attach the top? Looking forward to your reply.  Thank you  Adam
this is a gorgeous table awesome job
Jewish?
How did you attach the top. I seen the boards sitting on the legs and I seen the top but how did you attach them without going through the top? Or is that what you did?
Sweet, the video was super helpful. I was looking at trying to find how to make a dining room table for my fiancé and I since i'm sure you're aware that one's that look like this go for ten times the price it costs to make them yourself. I appreciate you taking the time to make this video, as well as posting where you got materials, how much they cost, and what you used.
You imagine stubbing your toe on that breast.
Beautiful table without all the expensive tools great job.
Love this build - if you don’t mind, would be great to know the top and bottom dimensions. Thank you!
may i know how you joint between table top and leg?

Great effort pal,the table looks great ,we would retail this in our shop for about £800!
A perfect instructional video; simple, direct, basic tools and clear directions.  Very well done, sir.  Well done indeed.
It was cool to watch you get this done without all of the major equipment that most are using. Thanks for posting. Beautiful table.
Excellent work. Thanks for sharing. Going make this next month.  Any ideas for chairs or benches to go with it?
Great table, looks amazing  Do you screw the top part from the bottom ?
Great Job.  This is what I want!
My future gaming table, perfect, simple, strong and big.
Nice.  Sensed your nervousness with presenting your work.  Be proud.  You did a great job, and inspired me.  Thank you.
That is awesome looking!!  I am going to attempt to make one....Love the color!!!
If you enjoy woodworking plans, you will love woodprix. Get inspired by all the endless possibilities of furniture plans and other wood projects to build, for both indoors and outdoors.
Great job dude!! Table looks killer I'll try and report back..simple and easy directions..
It's suck
Wood Prix is nice for that.
I made it about three weeks ago. On woodprix website I learned a lot about it. Check it mates.
Would like to build the same without the bolts.
Hi fellows. I think you need to take some time and take a fast tour on woodprix website to learn how to make it.
Tools used: 1. Circle Saw  2. LOL
You should try moving the mic away from your mouth. Oh and possibly get checked out for that abnormal breathing problem. After every sentence you're sucking spit or in-haling very strangely. Decent job on the table, but I have just one question. How does one transport this to their dining room without a forklift?
How did you inset the bottom cross beam into the leg supports?
Hey  Can you please give me the high size of the legs only? Thank you
How did u attach the legs to the top of the table please because am making one. Thank u
I really like the way a came out great job! I feel inspired to do the same thing
working with a tree has become much simpler with Stodoys plans.
U have no clue what u are talking about when it comes to staining or varnishing.  But nice table.
really nice !!! מעולה!
Except for the constant weird breathing sounds.. this is a great table video!  Awesome job!
A few questions. Why do you need  6- 2x4x8? And how did you attach the top to the bottom.
Love it.  Minimal tools, best build I've seen.
Only time, will tell you if its a good build. Its pretty decent looking although I have experience, coupled with reservations about what's going to happen with the design. Nonetheless, be proud to build it, stain it and finish it on your own. It is gratifying to start with raw products and build something to be proud of, kudos for your efforts!
👍👍
nice stuff
OK this is some fantastic stuff. Now we gotta get you a quality camera and someone to film for you so you can go in to depth about how everything is done such as the top, how it's attached, etc. Great job with the table. You could be a YouTube genius with a little help on the film side.
Amateur good job
Very well done! Simple yet awesome job!!
How big did u make it
Awesome Table man !!!  Lovely color pick too, unique, diff than most !!  Also love the fact you got it done without a garage full of Very expensive Electric tools.  Don't have to be 100% perfect plain and square.  Has more character if it ain't if you ask me.  Supposed to be a Farmers type table not an Engineers table.  Great work Naftali !!!!
Very nice design. Im gonna use the same base as you have. Thanks!
if you dont mind me asking what do you have on your head? Is that a cap?
💗 the table and color
I just want to thank you for your woodwork arranges (search on google)  *magicwoodplan*com*
After searching online for the perfect Farm Table ideas I have happened upon yours.......And this is what I'm going with! I love how beefy it looks and the simplicity in the design. VERY NICE JOB!
Great table! Would you mind sharing the exact dimension or plan you used? Going to try and recreate it :)
god on you young man done well with little  tools regards Robert
Love it Thanks for the Tutorial!
Love What you did with the legs I'm going to make one just like it I think
How did you mount the top down to the legs?
Has many information in this woodworking book “pepe amazing plan” (Google it). There are some designs in the book but it is primarily explaining the whole process of how you can do different things and what tools to utilize to achieve them. In other words, I`m satisfied using this book, particularly in the procedure of understading about woodworking.
I just finished it...and I went off of this video Thanks dude!
Omg dude... this is freaking awesome... I was going to go to Babcock and buy a nice table, but I think I'll just build one instead...
IMPRESIONANTE. Muy bonita Felicidades. Saludos desde Barcelona Catalonia
Exquisite work! Love the colour, what polyurethane did you use?
Great job, it is beautiful.
Is the table top just sitting on the legs?
106.50 is your total.
I found this woodworking book more out of interest than utility, “pepe amazing plan” (Google it), and I happen to be impressed. It never disappointed me in my wish to have more information about the art of woodworking. I found several topics such as wood types and designing your workshop.
You did a great job. I will be building my own future dining room table and yours is definitely an inspiration for it.
Why are you dribbling mate
This video inspired me to make my wife a table out of wood that I foraged out of a dumpster. After plaining(my father in laws portable plainer), sand staining and polyurethane(5 coats sanding between coats) it turn out pretty good for an air conditioning guys work. I am definitely not a carpenter!She loves it! Thanks for posting this it was super helpful. I hope you don't mind but the table I made is very similar to yours. Wish I could post the pic of it. Thanks again!
Guys please do not do what this man did, that is using treated lumber for a project that is going to be inside your home. Second never cut into treated lumber without wearing both eye, skin and breathing protection. The reason being, treated lumber has many dangerous and poisonous chemicals which are used in the treating process and you surly do not want your family breathing in those fumes. No, neither staining nor painting the finished project will keep the fumes away from you, your wife and children. It will continue to expel fumes for years and years and years inside your home. Inasmuch, as the chemicals are  why treated lumber does not rot easily.  I love to see young people get into woodworking, however, a person who does so, should at least have an understanding of what is involved. You would not jump into a pool without knowing that there is sufficient water in the pool and you should not jump into woodworking without proper instructions from proficient woodworkers.  BTW  As to not using power tools, there are dozens of professional woodworkers who use only vintage hand tools and no power tools at all on the internet. Woodworkers who have posted  great videos on YouTube demonstrating how to build furniture etc. the old fashion way, find those, they will help you do it right and safe way. A few that I think you will like are Peter Sellers, Roy Underhill, Stumpy Nubs, Mr. Chickadee, just google their name and the word "videos added to the title search and it will get you to them.
what type of adhesive? wood glue, liquid nails or spray?
How did you join the bottom? I didn't see any hardware. was that where you used the adhesive?
Thank you so much Naftali, I want to make a table of my own. Now I have an idea of what materials and supplies I should buy but more importantly how to make it. I am more excited cause this will be my first table I will build, thanks again.
Thank you so much Naftali, I want to make a table of my own. Now I have an idea of what materials and supplies I should buy but more importantly how to make it. I am more excited cause this will be my first table I will build, thanks again.
nice job...i like specially the bottom part...legs and so on...
Wow i love those green seats,where did u get them from?
Couldn't make it through the whole video, Holmes. I'm sure it was great, but the weird teeth inhaling noise rubbed me the wrong way.
what kind of wood is it? the beams legs..
hey budy  use a brush for stain it is much easier  cleaner and faster
where do I buy the wood in these dimensions? great video man. I am totally gonna make this and send you a pic.
היי שלום מקווה שקורא עברית אהבתי מאוד שולחן עדיין לא החלטתי איך לבנות מה שרציתי בעצם להבין ראאיתי המון סירטונים ורציתי לדעת בדיוק את הצעדים וסוגי השכבות מתי לשים הכוונה צבע ווקס לכה פוליאתרן לא הבנתי כל הסוגים רציתי לדעת שלבים מדוייקים ואיזה חומר
Great job. I have make furniture for years. I like the base. It has a really hefty, enduring look that will be useable for years and years, should you ever need or choose to replace the top.
Nice work Naftali! I will be making a very similar table based on this video! Thanks for the vid!
Dude, thank u - this is awesome
AWESOME WORK!!!!!
this look like outdoor chill table not dining ..but cool
this gorgeous, I just wish you would have filmed the process while you were doing it.  You did a really, really good job! I hope to make one like this some day!
Awesome
The bottom beam that runs the length of the table, is it slotted into the cross bars? Also I love the strength and sturdiness of the table.
Amazing job, sir.
Very compliments!!! good job, I'm building a table too...
I need dimensions! Using the powers of inferrance I'm guessing the base is 6' x 3' x 2.5' ? Also, how did you attach the top to the base? Beautiful table, I'm trying to replicate the build!
beautiful... I will definitely steal some tricks out of this one
Can you put your measurements up? Very interested
Pressure treated legs? Not that smart of a choice. I would work on perhaps investing in a tripod and less heavy breathing also. Jeez
Shalom, Naftali. Great job. You have inspired me start build a dining table for our new house. Cheers, my friend.
Great build. I think I may build a similar base but out of steel. I can only hope it turns our as nice.
Awesome job! Would you mind sharing the measurements of your cuts? The distance between the legs specifically.Thanks
nice
how did you attach the top to the base? you didn't mention that part
gorgeous table. great job. I wanna make one now.
What are the measurements of your base? (width between two end legs, length of the center post connecting end legs, and then the height of the posts connecting the legs?)
nice table for shabat.
nice table great job.
Pressure treated?  really?
Is the table top removable? And if so how did you mount it? Also did you have to run the 2x12 through a jointer so they went together pretty good? Nice build turned out really nice.
An excellent table mazal tov
Awesome man- how has the warping been on the construction-grade lumber after 2+ years?
so overall your table came out to approximately 8ft, right?  Could I go with 2"x12"x10' without having to add more legs?  Your table looks immensely sturdy so it shouldn't need more legs but not sure
I love this video.  Will this table fit 10 chairs comfortably?
for the bottom brace what are the lengths of middle piece across and two that are side to side in the legs
Do you have your plans by chance? or lengths and everything you used written out?
how did you attach the legs to the top of the table?
Hello, Member of the Tribe, you done a wonderful job.  Permit me to suggestions:  1.  Take a spay bottle with a narrow, elongated tip , put a tarp on the floor and squirt stain between the top boards.  I made that mistake, i.e., leaving them unstained before I assembled everything. 2.  Surprised you used exposed bolts for the bracers on the leg.  You could have screwed them in from the other side (with glue on the joint)and they wouldn't have been visible.  Nit picking.  Sorry, but that's the way my mind often works.  See something, say something.
The table looks great and all with just a circular saw?  Impressive.  I hope to build something similar this winter when I have more time. Thanks for posting.
Great table. Could you tell me how you made the top so seamless as well as how you attached the base to the table top?  Excellent table. Additionally,  could you tell me the overall tabletop length?
Nice table. How did you secure the table top to the base?
Great job
great job
Hi! Thanks for this awesome video- the table looks amazing! Can you tell me 1) How did you move the table into your house? 2) How did you attach the top of the table to the rest of it/the bottom? Thanks in advance!
how did you attach the table top to the base?
great job! watching you do this.. reminded me of my youth and your 'can do' attitude is awesome.
My mistake. His name is Woody Hyezmar and he was about to sell his plans, but now he's making them available to download, I don't know for how long.
Hey Naftali,  Very nice job. I was wondering to build the same table, but here everything is calculated in cm. :) I can see that you wrote every stuff in inch, its not problem, but how about the length of them? I guess the legs were made from the 6x6x10(?), but not sure how long wood, I would have to cut for the legs as I think 10in is not the length of the legs. PLease let me know, if I am wrong. thx!
The word is that Hyezmar (google him) is going to change his mind and sell his plans, but as of today they're still available to download, you’re welcome :D
I absolutely love that table. I am going to attempt to make one. How did you attach the table top to the base that you built? Please let me know. Also, did you use another notch for the long cross bar?
parabens esse projeto ficou muito bom
can show measurements
How is the beam that goes the length of the table attached? Was there another notch cut out?
I heard he's going to sell it online soon, so you might want to get Hyezmar's Woodworking Bible. Even though it's not 100% complete it has some solid plans.
you are jewish? :)
Nice table, it inspired me to attempt this build using your general design. I am not yet completed my table project but I have the base completed with the  top being glued - looking good so far. I've drawn out all the dimensions to try and mimic your table but I found my "I" beam is slightly longer (at least it looks longer, oh well). I also used 6" lag bolts instead of 8" bolts through the table. Maybe ill make a video response when its done... This is my first carpentry project so it is taking me a lot longer.   Great work on your table.
I made this and I came out good
Great table, looks awesome! I'm trying to build my own - but I would need it to be a little wider. Would it be possible to add another 2x8 - what would I need to do extra to support it? I need a table at least 36 inches wide but if I can get it to 40inches that would be optimal.  Any input would greatly appreciated.  Also if you have any suggestions for making would benches?
Great job.  It looks really sturdy.  I may build one just like it and us an epoxy coating for a table on my deck.  Thanks for posting this video.
This looks sweet! I really like the style and simplicity of it all. It just goes to show that you don't need a shop full of tools to create something this awesome.
Thank you for this video. I've watched this about 10 times. What type of wood did you use?
looking to build one myself soon. how was that too fastened to the bottom though? or is it just sitting there.
Just a suggestion titebond III wood glue and a couple clamps would have saved the bolt heads being seen, because they'd not have been there lol. BUT man it looked good. other than that it was pretty clean.   Follow a guy on here The Samurai Carpenter. He's got a -lot- of tools but just do a bit of research to determine what the old ways of doing what the power tools do now are. and you'll be able to do quite a bit with not very much in way of tooling.
could you show more detail on how the table top was fastened to the legs?  screw placement I love this table and want to duplicate it!
Love it!
Nice
great job !!!!
Awesome! and inspiring. Ignore the jerkoff comments - they are the dudes beating their puds wishing they had a male chromosome.
Beat it with a ball peen hammer using the ball side all over the wood after you put it together - with a propane torch scorch the wood slightly burning it is ok fine - steel wool the scorched wood- then poly it let it dry and set then sand with steel wool between each additional  coat  you have made a old looking new table
would all pressure treated wood be suitable for an outdoor table?
How did you attach the top to the legs? and also how far in are the legs from the edge? I was thinking of putting the legs on the actual corners buy I like this as you can have more chairs
It's really great to see how much you can do with minimal tools. But wood moves. It needs room to expand and contract as the humidity changes throughout the year. I don't see how the frame around the table and the supports secured underneath are going to allow the wood to move without it cracking.
That pressure treated wood can warp really bad, so it wouldn't be my first choice at all if I had access to anything else given the amount of work your putting into the table.  Maybe that doesn't matter once its all braced up though.
AWESOME!!!!!
Can you tell me, how heavy is this table?  Is it easy to move into the house?
Great job
Thank you for the video, that is exactly what I needed, simple but effective. Did you put lacquer on top of the stain?
saliva must be oozing because in every sentence he would suck it back in... but other than that great job
This is really cool and I'd love to try this.
Beautiful. Nice work
could you post the blue prints for this table,,,,pretty awesome and I would love to build one for myself...
table look good the only thing pressure treated lumber material is not ready to painting  or stain until the wood dry for 6 month after 6 month pass you can apply anything you want,  and is to danger have this wood inside the house because chemical exposed  from PTL can make you really  sick
Haha. The most basic tools and the results are a freaking fantastic job. Well done.
Nice job man! I was looking for how to build a work table for my shed but this is a nice piece you done for indoor furniture.
Great job!! This is how we need to be. If we become more pro active with our own skills we can supply our own needs..
Great job!
Nice. How do you call the two things you painted it with? They are both called the same thing?
nice work
So I have a question...The legs. I see how you cut the wedge to connect the legs with the 4x6 across the width of the table. Did you do the same with the 4x6 that went across the length? Couldn't really tell from the video. Also on the items list you have 6 1x3x8 and 3 1x4x8. That wasn't listed when you had all the wood piled up. What did you use those for?   Are there bench plans?   Thank you! Great job!
great design!  Thanks so much.  How did you fasten the top to the base uprights?I'm building 4 for a small Muskoka restaurant that my daughter and her partner are opening - deck tables.  Scaling to square for 4 people.  Love the simplicity and final look.  Great video.  Nice dog!  My brother has one the same.
How did you build the cross beam?
What is the length of the cross members in between the legs and the one that runs length wise
Love this video ! Enjoyed watching it !
You wa$ted $70.50, Pallet wood is free, : )
Wow!!! I love it its super nice!! Im definitely telling my husband to built me one
thanks for the video i was not happy with the legs of the table i built and your ideas for yours helped me with mine. Nice job on your table its beautiful.
I loved the video it was made simple which is great for a girl like me because I don't I have a zillion different wood working tools.👍👍👍
Check out this  oak wood end table on eBay: http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view&id=131744434644&alt=web
shouldn't be using PT for indoor stuff but looks nice
Great table! - Great work. How did you move it into the house?
I LIKE IT IT'S COOL :)
YOU HAVE FREE PLANS FOR THAT TABLE :)
Thanks man!!  I am making a 4x6 table and found your video.  Very helpful.  Great work!
please write table's dimensions. Thanks
just found your video very nice work!!
How easy does it clean up? I have a 2.5 year old, and sometimes food gets left on it, can it be scrubbed and cleaned without getting scratched, and water marks left on it?
great job. I was hoping to have a good laugh watching you all lifting it into place.lol
My question is , how did you put the table inside?
did you use the same stain on the legs as the tabletop?
I loved it, I'm prone to diy projects. No longer spending thousands of $ on something I might like. 'if I can't find it, build it' Thanks sooooo much for sharing this. ♡♡
great job  could we get some more detail as to how the base was constructed  dimensions ?  thanks
Doesnt pressure treated lumber have cyanide or some toxic crap in it?
Good Job !!!
Hey Naftali, Wonderful work, beautiful table, a quick question: how did you attach the frame of the table to the upper part? you don't show the table from underneath and I wonder how you make sure the thick log legs attach securely to the table surface? Thanks Gur from Israel
is it around 300 lbs?
awesome job
Buddy...  with the most basic tools and your common sense techniques (which most of us do not have)  you did a DAMN GOOD JOB, a piece of ART, which rivals professional carpenters workmanship, utilizing expensive tools.  All I have to say is that you are a genius !!!
I have enjoyed watching this very much, it looks really good with the colour you have used.  Harry in the U.K
thanks buddy great job
Did you glue the 2X12's together? Or use the wood underneath for bracing?
good work but that heavy breath is bothering
buen trabajo
If you want to make your own wood tool yourself just look for woodprix website. There is all you need to make it :)
this is exactly what YouTube needs. a video of someone creating something out of wood without the $30k workshop you see everyone having with their planers and sanders and jointers and saws. well done chap.
you've done a top job building this table with minimal tools. like many others though i think using pressure treated is a no no unless for outdoor use. just too risky indoors. hope you sealed the legs to reduce the risk. otherwise a great job and a great table.
Great job on this!  I'm thinking of doing it, but I am worried about fitting the table into the house without breaking it, the walls, or my back!    Is there a way to but it together/finish it in two parts?  I was thinking of making the base, and then making the top, and screwing everything together once I was inside the house.  My hope was to find some sort of trick so that when I needed tot make it apart, I could do that without significant damage/wear on the holes...your thoughts?
Gorgeous! I'm tempted, of course its scary u obviously know ur way around it and I don't. Ive been looking for a dining set on the market and nothing is appealing to me, they look so weak besides my chairs are beautiful and I  want to keep them. This table is fantastic! Thanks for the vid.
how long is it?
deletant
3:52 wood movement! D:
The comments about the pressure treated wood are correct. These comments are just informative. In most every project mistakes are made which are lessons learned to be applied in the future. A good workman learns from their mistakes and doesn't take it personal. Keep at it. Good Work!
Well done dude!!!
I love how you do this with such minimal equipment. Definitely a piece of art. Your wife must be very happy.   On another note, this table would cost maybe $1200 at Nebraska furniture mart.
YOU MAKE FUNNY NOISES....
table is nice perfect, but I saw one moment which costed you so much time :D whan you cutted connections in wood  2.03. You need just to cut twice in beginning and in the end not billion times between . You think how to get off what big piece of wood out? easy . You need 1 hammer + 1 chisel or if you have flat screwdriver also works :) .One simple hit and it split off what big piece of junk  :) . You can hit multiple times in easy with no strength  in different line locations to be more perfect :)
or messurement on the base with /length
what's the distance between each leg from side to side?
This is a note about the little trolls that seem to be more and more ubiquitous these days: Ignore their comments.  Their negativity just reflects poorly on themselves.  NONE are able to do what you do.  If they could, they would do something productive and share it on YouTube and subject themselves to other trolls.
Great looking table, especially since you were limited to using a circular saw to make all your cuts.  Thank you for sharing your building of this fine piece.
Angles might not seem so hard if u used a Miter saw or a speed square. And a router could of saved you hours on the build. All and all i thought the table looked nice but you really over worked yourself. There is a correct tool for every job.
Great job, thank you!
Any idea how much total this ended up weighing? (sorry if I missed that somewhere). Thanks bud!
how long did you cut the 4X6 length middle support?
mounts
is the top screwed on or is it just on top without attachments or mounta
Wonderful! Thank you!
pretty cool. Nice Job!!
yikes,u r butcher and no carpenter...
If you don't mind telling me what color was the top red??
I like the legs. But I would criticize the top. I think I would have done a breadboard top.
dude wear a glove, im pretty sure that coating is very bad to your skin.
I would NEVER use "treated" lumber for anything indoors.  At first I thought you were making a nice outdoor table with the treated 6x6.
Really good, thanks!
Fucking cool table
So you went from cutting the legs for the table to the bar. What happened in between? You skipped that step.
Great table. how did you fasten the table top to base.
Chisel woud make breaking those splines away
how do you attach the top to the base
lol  circle saw he says.
thank you ... Learned a lot..
Mean As!
awesome
nice table! i want to build one!
great job and thank you for taking the time to post it.
Outstanding video and great looking table.
Nice and beefy, solid looking table. dimensions? I am going to build something similar
Great Project! looks amazing!
Awesome job !!
need more measurement what's the leg size, the support board between the leg, length of the top.
is their any way we can get the de mention size of all your cuts
Don't use pressure treated wood indoors and whenever you cut pressure treated wood always use a mask. The chemicals inside the wood aren't anything you want in your body.
what a great job....i was a little concerned until you stained it.......( i know nothing about making furniture) ...after the stain i was amazed........what a beautiful table!!  Now if you could build me a tiny one and a tiny house  :)
Nice table! That turned out way better than I thought it would.
Questions: 1) What is the length of the leg supports using the 6x4x12 beams? 2) what is the length of the cross beam running the length of the table?
How did you attach the top?!!!!???!!!
Nice Job!
super simple great look. want to make mine a bit bigger
bit over engineered or was that just the look you were going for?
Nice inexpensive build. how wonky is it after the green treat dried?
First off - Thanks for taking the time to document this project and for the cut list.  I am about to start this with a couple twists of my own.  Was wondering if you documented or video'd the table top process at all..?
The table looks great! I like how just the top is shiny so it contrasts with the bottom. Makes the shine pop. Under 200$, awesome!!
Great work and quite impressive as well.
Naftali. Hey awesome job on the table. Inspired me to try one for myself. You think you could help me with a few questions? Any help would be appreciated.  1. Length of crossembers that secure to legs? 2. Length of foot rest? 3. L W of table top?   Thanks brotha. Nice job. Keep building
looks verry good
Its beautiful!
I have two questions, first of all how did you Attack top to base and more importantly... Is the 4x6 that runs from end to end attached to the rails or just sitting on them?
awesome table dude
Thats beautiful. I'm going to attempt to follow your blueprint next week. Wish me luck!
Clever. Thank you for sharing your information. I do a lot of creative improvements on my little farm. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjWwzxoKf0j7uSkO9BjmG8A/videos  Jerry of Pine Meadows Hobby Farm
Cool table and nice job. But do all that nice work and not have the side rail go all the way across. Next time pay the extra 10 bucks and it will really give it a finished look...
Hey great lookin table! But I have a question, why so much sanding if your going to beat it up?
Great job on the table!! don't worry bout people hating on you using pressure treated, obviously they didn't here the part about that's the only type you could get. How did you secure the top to the base??
you must have asthma!!
כל הכבוד ממש יפה
i would like to make this table but not sure the exact materials to use and the exact measurements you ust to make the cutouts. is it possible to send me a list. me and my wife loved the table. it will be perfect for our new home we are purchasing. thanks
you goto a typical store these days and that kinda table would cost people like 2200$ , i'll go the route you did!!! lol
Dang breathing problems
Nice table...good job! Only negative I would say is that you shouldn't use pressure treated lumber indoors for this sort of application.  While its not a huge deal pressure treated lumber is pressure treated for outdoor use or some parts of home construction which may be exposed to moisture such as sill plates etc. Why bring more chems into the home that are unnecessary. As a suggestion you might have tried laminating a few 2x6's together. Again not bashing your work, just making a suggestion.;)
How many chairs can you fit on the table.
Love the table I would have painted the bolts black but that's just me but over all you just gave some great ideas thanks much
or if there is a site I can get the drawing on how to ??? id apppreiate
how did u fasten the top to the base and is there a schematic with dimensions????
Thank you so much for sharing this! Very helpful.  I'm ready to make this! :)  Did you make benches?  Do you also have an instructional video for that?
Is that Nick Jonas!!!....sweet table man
Pressure treated wood has a lot of toxic chemicals in it; it's really not a good idea to build indoor furniture using that stuff.
This is a beautiful table, will attempt to make!!
Looks great pleas tell us what color stain and table cut list, but at least the color of the stain you used. thank you.
Excellent Job !!!
Great job bro!
What colour stain did he use???
Just curious as to why you didn't use carriage bolts on the legs instead of regular bolts.  Bolt heads showing kind of takes away from the effort in my opinion.  Otherwise, I think you did a fantastic job.
disable comments so all the trolls like pimp concretecoma what a dip shit can not post great job thanks.
I liked the style of table very good Thanks
Way to go man !! Great job !!  Will start building one like this soon, hope will succeed like you did..  Gary
Congratulations For the tools you use You do a Great Job...Question: Can you tell me the Legs (Height) Dimensions....Thanks
Excellent video, and a great job!  Man I've seen these tables costing up to a couple thousand in furniture stores!
I love his accent!!  <3 so sexy!!  the tible is also very nice! ;)
***** Awesome Video! How did you attach the 2x12's to the 2x4's without showing anything through the top? (Or is it just tough to see?)
woah looks expensive nice job
whats with the constant teeth sucking?
Congratulations this is a good  looking  table  I hope you  don't mind if I  make 1 like  yours  But I really like it  Thank you
if you do it again, use a table saw to clean up the rounded edges on the 2x12's and they will be square.  laminate those and clamp and you can't hardly tell there is a seam unless you really look..,.looks good as is though...nice job
I really appreciate you sharing how you built this table. I found your video because I was looking for a simple DIY I could do with a circular saw as my major tool and after seeing this I don't need to search any further. The only addition I would make is to include an ice tray as my table is for outdoor use. Great job!
Nice work.
How long is the bottom cross beam? And how long is the support between the legs?
Thats awesome, thank you so much for sharing this video.
that table is tough, looks nice. i think you can use that table for 100 years
That is a beautiful table. Well done!
Awesome table, friend! Thanks for taking the time to share it. Be well.
Very nice! Remember safety regarding the treated wood.  SemperFi
Good job! Have you made the top movable or it's fixed?
Great build!  the mitres not fitting...well thats just charactor! how many people do you need to sit?  and do you want to make sure they don't steal your table when they leave the dinner party!!!  Well done!!
Did you have a guide or something? A book?
Beautiful Table ! Such patience! :)
Really Nice-
nice work
Pressure treated lumber is for out door use one of the chemicals in it cyanide!
First, it is a great build and I love it, but the comments are right. You shouldn't have treated lumber inside. Keep building!
Super!
how did you get the long beam connected to the rest legs did you wedge it between the little 4x6's
I think you did a great job!  Looks really nice!
We are on the process of makong this table, beautiful Table , in our case we will do 4 chairs and 1 bench, thank you
Beautiful result: thank you.
Great Job. Forget these Unemployed, Overweight, Gastric Bypass, non talented Pill Poppers. They don't own a Screwdriver. Do your thing. Awesome Job !!!
did u sand it
Here are the problems with your process: 1. You're using what looks like a pine 6x6. I'm saying this because I've noticed that pine sometimes has a greenish tinge to it. This doesn't work out well plain or with a light stain. If you intended to do what you did by staining it dark then there's no problem. It's not very versatile otherwise. 2. You haven't recessed the bolts completely. I personally wouldn't have used bolts. Basic screws or even nails would've been better. For greater aesthetic appeal it's not a noticeable reduction in strength for purely functional purposes. 3. Your stain application is all wrong. When dealing with softwoods in particular, ALWAYS condition your wood. I even go a step further and use a pore filler. If you don't condition, your stain will come out blotchy or too dark. 4. Avoid red stains when working with woods like pine. Red stain works on hardwoods that can take a good polish and have a deep grain. Pine has, in my experience, never taken a good polish. Only if you use chemical sealing and finishing compounds have I ever seen pine shine and it doesn't look too good. Artificial. When woring with pine, stick to light and dark brown shades. This can make it look like oak which just has a warmer feel.
Poor choice of wood.
Nice lesson! Thank you!
Hey man, great build. That a really nice table. My brother and I are planning on trying this soon. I have heard though that using construction lumber for furniture isn't recommended because it can warp and become wobbly. Did this happen in your case? If not, I'm definitely using this method. Way cheaper!
You have some Mad Skills.  Beautiful Work!
Hey man great table, my favorite by far on here. question how long and wide is your bottom frame? Also, how long and wide is the top of the actual table? thanks man!!
Nice but you need a forklift just to move the dang thing. I like that you didn't use gloves to stain it. I bet your hands were red for a week. Still a nice table though.
awesome build!!! I wanna do it! my only question is How did you get the four legs for the bottom level so they dont wobble when all four are joined together??
Great video, man. Need new furniture but may try a little DIY and get this knot my dining room. Thanks!!
Shalom Friend!
wow beautiful table! I'll try to build one too and see how it goes. :) Thanks a lot for the video!! Can you say approximately how heavy the table is or does it depend on the wood you use?
love the table I think I will use your design to build my own. However I will be using round pegs instead of bolts. Again great table and design .
Great table I plan on making one for our house . I was wondering what you used to seat on, did you get chairs are make a bench . I plan on buying two chairs for the end and making two benches .
Nice work - I made a dining table from reclaimed pallets. Take a look at my step by step guide - http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-ModernRustic-6-Person-Dining-Tabledesk-and-Cha/
Awesome job!  That baby should last awhile.
It looks like a table that Joseph, Jesus' cuckold father (cause God was his real folk), did to me a couple o' years ago. I had shown him a trick or 2 about controlling people through reading and he was like " Geez!" and i said " I know! dude" i think i still have it in my moldy shack.... i think     But it's a cool table.... just not healthy as the green preservative stuff is not legal in Canadian homes (carcinogen) but the basics are neat.
what kind of wood you used for the table :? for the 2x12
hey, how many hours approx would you say it took you to complete this?
Is the top attached to the legs or does it just sit on the frame like a trestle table, so that you move the legs and top separate.  If it just sits on the frame do you notice much movement? I also notice you called out screws in your description but those look like bolts / nuts holding the legs together    You did an amazing job with just a circular saw & a pruning saw.    I want to make one 10ft long and a little narrower 32in.   Thank you for a great video.
what were the dimensions?
Hello,  Thank you for this build, this is precisely what I want to do. I have a question, the piece that joins the legs, how did you cut them at that angle? Please let me know and thank you for your time.
How did you attach the top to the legs
Sounds like he is sucking spit back in his mouth the whole dang video.
Great video. Like the table a lot. You do nice work.  One traditional way to remove all the wood slices from the notch after you cut with the circular saw is to take a hammer and smash out the wood slices from one side to the other (perpendicular to your cuts) then use a chisel to clean up the bottom of the notch.
It is a great table no doubt but I only concern about the pressure treated beam you used in terms of the chemicals inside it when you use it for dining purpose.
Thanks so much for responding back! That will be  our next project!
Good job! How many chairs can you put at your table? I need to make one for 8 chairs.
Do you have plans for this table?
Nice work! :)
What are the dimensions for the table?
I think if you sunk those bolts in the legs some and spray painted them black, it would look better. Did you use kiln dried 2x12's for the top?
Beautiful table, you should be proud of yourself!
Furniture is so expensive these days and were about to move into a rental.  Do you mind posting the dimensions of the table and a list of materials (sizes) needed.  I would really love to build this for my family.  Thanks!!
pruning saw?
This is my favorite table out of all of YouTube! I'm going to try this.  I was wondering if you ever thought about using a halving joints for joining the four legs to the two cross pieces at the bottom of the table? (notching out BOTH pieces of wood rather than one..(see link) Maybe too much of a pain with treated wood?   http://www.tbc.school.nz/elearning/localsites/www.technologystudent.com/joints/crsh1.htm
hanks you, your  table cost less than most  the other video's to make. It looks good and strong . ,What store sell the stain and tools to use ?
You are killing me with, "Circle Saw". lol. Nice build nonetheless.
Hey love the table. I was wondering how long did you make the beam at the bottom.  And what was the size of the siding. Please and thank you.
What a great table.  How did you secure the top to the base or are you just letting it sit on top?
Table looks great! I'm going to try to replicate for my college apartment! Also how did you do the foot rest in the middle? Is it just sitting on top of the other boards or is it bolted in? Thanks!
Great table. Did you stain the pressure treated immediately after you put the table together or did you wait for the pressure treated wood to dry before staining?
Hey man jus wondering if u could explain how u finished the top but.. How dij u attach it to the top with the legs Thanks awsome work though
I really like how the table turned out. I have been considering building a table myself, and I think I like this style a lot. My wife and I are wanting to remodel with the farm house theme and I think a nice table like this would be a great way to start.
Look good I am looking to build one similar to you but I think I will use pocket hole technique  for screwing everything
