Can u make the Thai dessert that has the pandan pudding underneath with coconut cream on it? I like that dessert
Thank you! I have been wondering what to do with the longans. We live on a longan farm, so every summer we are buried in them.  Unlike North America, sugar is palm unless specified, rice is sticky, unless you say Khao Suai.  I am thinking I could cheat this a little by reworking the Khao Niew sitting in the cooler bucket. Super easy.   BTW, if you like thicker coconut milk, stir in s little instant coconut milk powder. Also good for thickening curries, where you want the coconut but not the water.
Justa saw on the package... milagkit... in filipino its malagkit..☺
Mam in india there is no pandan leaves what to do any subsitute for pandan leaves

Beautiful girl. This dessert could be consumed cold?

Pai, is Longan the same as Lai Chi?
Love from india

To all Indians Watching this...Pandan leaves are called Kewra Patta all over India...Kewra water/ kewra jal is popular for it's use in Biriyani, it is what gives Biriyani a sweet, fresh, heady smell.

A MUST TRY RECIPE!
Looks so delicious😁😋
Thank you for making it so easy for me to understand since I don't cook much. :)
My pandan plant is finally able to be harvested! 😏 perfect timing
It says on the label of the rice "Milagkit". In the Philippines, we call it "Malagkit" meaning Sticky.
I love your videos ♡♡
Hiya Pai, this looks so good, i have got all the ingredients so must make to test ... then soon neighbors will want more and more like with all your recipes!
I love this Chanel thanks for teach me make good food
Thanks for the last minute advice! Coconut milk spoils so easily! You're absolutely right! Cheers!
Is a Thai longen the same thing as a chinese litchee?
Can I cook the rice in a little coconut milk too?  This looks really good.
Yum!  Another good rice to use is carnaroli.  It's not the same, but still really good -- after all, risotto is basically savory rice pudding.
Omg, so yummy...I shouldn't have watched it on an empty stomach..now all I can think of is this.
Please make king mango
ดูแล้วคิดถึงบ้านเลยครับพี่ TT
Pai can I make this ahead of time or does this have to be served immediately?
Pailin your'e so cute
This always make my day so much better~ I cannot wait to try one of your recipes for the first time. I'm nervous. But I'm sure it'll be amazing, just like you! < 3 Thanks so much.
My friend has a longan tree which bears ridiculously good logans with tiny seeds and super thick flesh. Now I'm thinking of sneaking into her house to steal some longans and make this dessert.
Mmmm! !! Be one of the most classic and delicious desserts of thai gastronomy
Have you tried/made a traditional western rice pudding made with milk/cream and short grain rice? How does it compare? I would be tempted to finish cooking the rice with coconut milk to try and get it more creamy like a western rice pudding. Would that be a mistake?
omg 2 hours ago! love this dish!
i love you so much it was so cute when u said "shrek-y"
Is longan Lychee fruit
Hi! I just subbed yesterday and   I love your channel so much! You are supper amazing!!! 😆
Thank you for sharing your recipes and cooking with us, I’ve tried several  and loved it! I would love it if you would do on on khanom krok. I would love to be able to make this Street food at home.
And that looks wonderful. Rice pudding was a childhood comfort food. This looks like a great dessert.
I'm sorry but what is a ward dessert?
เมนูเรียกเบาหวาน แต่มันอร่อยมากค่าาา อิอิ
Pailin, I was wondering if you could do a video on how to make a southern Thai bamboo shoot curry? I recently had it in Phuket at the vegetarian festival, and I'd be really interested in seeing how it is made. Love your videos!
Very comforting dessert. As a thai food lover.. I will try tomorrow!
That Dessert dish originated in Spain. Then it was taken to South America with the Spaniards. Then the asians and Indians applied it to their diet. It's in the history books. I will send you the historical facts. It is a dish that was catered to the geographical environment. That is why every culture makes the Dessert a tiny bit different.
thumb's up
Looks nice :)
perfect... can i put lychee??
This looks delicious! I’m definitely trying this out.
Thank you, Pailin.
ใช้กะทิสดคั้นหรือใช้กะทิกล่อง
