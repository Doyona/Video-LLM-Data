Thanks sweetie us British ladies don't need no man 😂 💅
Never coil cable it creates a fire hazard.
Hi, what did you do with the yellow and green earth wire? As my fitting has an earth wire which I'm not sure what to do with as the ikea one only has options for the other two wires. I can't quite see on your video what you have done with your earth wire
It’s stupid the light fixture doesn’t come with the hook you need to be able to install the light ,
Thank you so much, can I ask did you have to get the metal hook somewhere else?
Thanks for video. If soft plasterboard, Put a small pawl plug in for the screw, otherwise it’s a right faff
Thank you so much for this video I just got one & didn't know how to install it
Bullshit
This video isn't going to work with everyone in the UK. Not everyone has a joist or has knowledge of using masonry drills to fit the hook. You're better off loosening the screws on the ceiling fitting slightly (aka ceiling rose) and running long zip cables behind the back of it, making sure to keep the zip ties on the inside side of the screws and then tightening the screws back up to ceiling so the ties become flush to the ceiling. Finally you can now run the zip cables through the light clip to hold the light up.
merci bien
I don’t understand why it come without the hook !!!
When u take off the original light is there just the three wires or is there more
Debbie you are a fucking hero mate!
Thanks a lot for this!
Awesome !!!

Thank you ! Your video just saved a marriage lol cx
Thanks for sharing your experience on it Deb, gonna give it a crack tomorrow, good video!
I didn't make it.  I connected the cables exactly as you did but the light doesn't come on .. What am I doing wrong?
I don't get it! That screw thingy is far too short so I can't hook it and screw it in at the same time. 😩
What to do when I have no hook?
Thank you for such informative video, I helped so much <3
Thank you!!
Perfect, thanks as I was scratching my head a little!
Ppc
Finally! Thank you! Best instruction on youtube!! Got all I need now.
Thank you, so simple and useful.
Excellent! Great instructions thank you 🙏🏾
Thank you sooo much I have just successfully installed an IKEA light 👍🏾
Is this the smaller £5 one you used? cheers stu
So straight forward and easy to understand your amazing!! 😀
Amazing so much detail in your video, everything I need to know to put my light fitting 👆. Thanks again!
Which size hook did you end up using as the video shows 2 different sizes
Ma’am you didn’t helped me much if you did not showed me how is at the right time
Cheers, this helped a hell of a lot 👍
thanks for this. this is like a gazillion times better than the b&w instruction insert. p.s. the melody does come with the wire and bulb holder right? thanks
I done the same light works fine, just light switch wont turn it off! (hall light so both switches won't turn it off).
I’ve been so intimidated to do this job, as myself and my fiancé have just moved into our first house. We bought a few new pendant lights for the house from Ikea and there are no decent videos on how to fit them - then I find yours! I’m gonna give it a go this weekend 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Lol, I just turned my light on, sparks and smoke everywhere 😂😂😂
I meant to start off with thank you
So I just needed to know how to put the thing that screws on on. In my instructions it didnt describe that process but I did recieve a plate with the hook on it. I am in the USA so maybe that's why there is minor differences.
Thanks! Was halfway into installing a similar lamp and couldn't get the wires into the switch. Didn't realize that I had to push before I put the wires in rather than after... stupid of me but your video saved the day!
What size hook?
Wow at first i was a bit intimidated about doing this myself but you made it look so easy!
Debstar, I love your content. Will you do a blind playthrough of ‘Dark Souls 3’? I think that would be marvellous!
Very helpfull :D
Hi, can I contact you privately? If yes tell me how please. Thanks
