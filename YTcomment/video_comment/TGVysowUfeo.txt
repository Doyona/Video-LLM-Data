I love this ❤
Super🎉❤
I love the Quran.
looks a tad cramped, but better : )
Miss Ikea Home tour. We need more
Looks great .I'm keeping my no seating area I don't want people thinking they should come visit me
Fantastic job with getting more seating.
I’m just seeing this. The space turned out beautiful. I would like a update to catch up since having a baby
What a gorgeous couple wish you were our neighbours ❤🎉
Beautiful couple. May God continue to bless them
Why is their surname  so funny?
Soooooo, they just got new furniture?  This is lame.
it looks blah
Okay but they are the cutest couple
I watched this video in anticipation of seeing the happy dance.
The three footstool idea is great!!. ❤️
anyone know the name of that coffee table
That was awesome. Wasnt expecting such a change. Stools under the tv shelving unit a great idea. And the sofa bed.   Though I'm yet to find a truly comfortable sofa bed that doesn't feel thin and sag after medium term usage!

Sweeetest couple!
That was nice. My living room is next.

Lovely people, amazing makeover but I was hoping for the happy dance....
Its crazy what Americans consider “small”
Great..a room full of Dark Cheap Looking Expensive Furniture
Loved The Walkers and the IKEA Lady
Ten film uswiadomil mi, ze ikea zarowno u nas jak i w usraelu jest dla biednych ludzi.
I like it!
Wow awesome setup!! ;)
Wow. Where do I get a 3.5k home makeover for free!!!
Lovely couple wish them well as they become a family but gutted we  didnt see the happy dance lol best wishes
Love the idea of stools under the TV cabinet!
How do u apply for this
They are so bright:) very nice family
The website you put for where to find these products does not work
Fabulous!
Great video
Varför är IKEA så populärt i USA
Is there IKEA home make over team in India guys? Please let me know
I love these people
Incredible IKEA! Can you have that too here in the Philippines soon?
Could you list the names of the products? The link doesn’t work anymore.
Such a cute couple, and the space turned out 100%.
adorable couple.
Very cool but those sharp corners with a baby? Lots of protective padding will be needed . I would have gone with storage ottomans for toy storage
I love the couple ..... So energetic and loving
What is the bed model number , please ?
I love it
Greaaaaat😊
All it took was different pieces of furniture not knocking out a wall!  So simple if you know what pieces to use.  Turn on some music and those lights and dance!
Very functional decor.
Where was my happy dance i was promised
Such a happy couple  God bless this family.
Ikea cheap tacky junk
Please come to my place ! 😀
Help me

Great sleeper sofa!
I seriously CAN NOT wait til Ikea opens up here in San Antonio TX ! The sign just went up yesterday & it just makes so freaking excited for spring.  I'm waiting to buy all my future form Ikea so I really just can't wait 😂 🙌
Super and bewtiful couple. Bless this couple and  their baby!
From the look of a crappy motel with hourly rates to the uninspiring "ambiance" of a junior suite at a Best Western... Neat!
Love this show my whole house is small my living room is 18by14 what can I do to it
What a nice couple!
Love it
,
Furniture is all y'all did, looks about the same and I'm sure they could've added a sleeper and ottomans themselves.
What a Nice couple their energy was so great
Wow good job
Where is the Happy dance?!?!😢
He didn’t do the dance......
Whats the price of this convertable sofa?
Beautiful!  And what a cute couple.

The couch is very cool!
What! I have that chair and the ottoman, same color too! They are very comfortable and fit perfectly in my bedroom.
Love this!!❤❤

Why do people wear shoes in their house? Are the floors dirty that they dont want to take off their shoes?
Dude look like c-lo's brother...lol
I did a good job. It give me some ideas
💓❤💓
Ni
It came out nice
Lovley couple 😊
Am I the only one who is anoyed by the dab or whatever its called? Why oh why.
Wow! So nice
Good solution. Scale of furniture is  a very important thing.
The walkers r so happy ,love it. 🐙
Nice upgrade on the living room. Looks cool and comfy
Elizabeth you're hot!
Omg how cute are they
Great energy!
Why would anyone buy a house with such a tiny livingroom?  Cute couple.
Wow, i love it.. nice ikea.
So beautiful and modern looking wow truly a job well done
Cool! And wow : Tiffany is one of the most gorgeous women ever!!
I find thay sofa bed not comfortable. Because underneath the cushion there is nothing. Jusy storage. So there is no support for your body weight. Does anyone else feel the same way ?
Love the happy dance! Congratulations
This was an awesome make over! I wonder why so many dislikes......😒
So nice and good people helping for re organize..
What was the size of that living area? Looks just like ours. What were the items you brought in, too? Thanks! Hope to hear from the Ikea guys.
we wuz scandinavians n sheeit
Omg! They're *Walkers* !!!! Run!!!!
How did they get the lights behind the tv?!
It's pretty but now all u really have is extra uncomfortable seating- ever try to sit on a foot stool? I probably would've opted for the Frieheten sofa- sleeper w/ chaise & put an ottoman/ coffee table with it
I loved that couple!!!
Wow! Such an improvement on their tiny apartment! Congrats beautiful couple!! 👍💯👍
wow. great couple.. thanks IKEA!
its the sims 4 city living rug
What lovely people! The room looked great and they were obviously delighted 😀
Looks like a hotel room.
What is the sofa called??
beautiful
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ROOM FOR SUCH A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE!!!!

Omg this family is so cute I love them 😂
Am I the only British person who is watching this

How sweet!
Oh my gosh!! The ottomans under the entertainment center is an amazing idea!!
Finely . This z i can call change .after watching a number of   vedio .Lots of love from India .
Makeover starts at 1:17 :)
I wish this would happen to me we just moved from being homeless I have no money for anything we have broke recliners no couch no tables no nothing ugggggg
Love everything about this: The design crew; The living room;  The young family.   The living room is definitely more interesting because it has secreted storage.  Love all the new integrated seating.   Almost would have preferred an L-shaped sofa for comfort though.   And more color,   maybe.
That Denon will cook inside!
OMG my heart
nice
"you guys" "you guys" "you guys"
Wow !!!  Looks amazing !!!!
I like this couple. What they did with their living room was very cool. The result is very nice and sleek. Hope they enjoy it.
That's not a small living room...  it's that's small then my living room is tiny
Great couple!!!!
I like it!
I have a small living room. You guys did an amazing job. Thanks for the video and ideas.
I would like to have a living room makeover. How can i apply for that? Thanks
Please come to my trailer next
Damn I need to head to ikea
I hope one day. IKEA will come to Vietnam
Can some one please help me with the exact layout of this Besta entertainment center, I want the exact layout , pleeease
no ikea india?
Ayeeee detroit!!!!
I love the idea of the three footstools under the TV
I need help with my very small apartment
Funny, I thought you would do a chaise and chair with a n ottoman or two.  But, I do love the pull-out, particularly with storage (that will be great for baby as s/he grows!) Now I need to see a chaise implemented.  Am thinking of trading in my leather futon-sofa for a chaise & chair with ottoman and want to see it work, first. I need a space that works well for customers, and home, too!. Why?  I work out of my home!  My spot works, or my clients say so, but it gets full fast...
I totally wanna live around neighbors like the Walkers! 😁👏 A great couple!
What is the cost for living room dinning room makeover. About. Oh yes and furniture put together.
no price
looks like that but it's not like that. It's all about ikea's quality concern
Does anyone know how this works? We have a small house and would love to have Ikea remodel our living room, but we're from Texas and all IKEA's here are far. Can I still enter?
I'm in Detroit to come to my house and help LOL
I love the couple ... seems very friendly.
What happened to the happy dance???
really guys....  incredible wrk.!!!  loved it
Am I the only one who was waiting for his happy dance ? ... yeah oh ok
How much does it cost for a bedroom makeover??
Awe I love this !
yahhh i like to chang my room
What a delightful couple! I was so waiting for his happy dance! Great video wonderful ideas to maximize any space!! :)
I live in Michigan!!
i love ikea even when i was a kid.. i have played with the house furniture making it as if it as if it was ikea... because it was available in europe at that time.. huhu😁😂
What happened to the happy dance?!
Looks nice, but that sofa doesn't look like it will hold up....as in cheap.
What's the name of the living room table?
Bingewatching these make overs
Hello, I was wondering if you can sign me up for it.?
I love ikea!!!
Before Remodeling Ill Move To A Diffrent City First

I seriously have to get you all to fix My space
What is that couch?
I have two areas in my kitchen that need help. It's good space for storage/organization.  Need help! What is the unit under the mirror.
The new space is beautiful, but I would really like to see more detail about what went where in the redecorating. For example, where did all the books and other things go that were previously stored in the bookcase next to the sofa? I would have a much better sense of the "upgrade" to the space. Also, the BESTA system looks great but is there a functional aspect to it that allows for ventilation for electronics? More detail would be great.
Nice!!!
Awesome, IKEA did a great job! Congratulations
what a lovely fun couple, love the room Ikea !
cute couple, congrats!
Love love love this ❤️
having electronics enclosed in a non ventilated hideaway is a terrible idea, its especially bad for Audio receivers.
VERY NICE!👏👏
very nice. modern and chic
