I still use this 11 years later
Making your marinara now, on the stove top. Very good! Thank you.
I take fresh Italian tomatoes, with Italian basil, and Italian red pepper flakes, a pinch of Italian salt, and then I stir it all up with my Italian hand.
All the Pomi tomatoes I look at are NOT processed with plum tomatoes. A tablespoon of peperoncino is a "little spicy"?
The best in the world? And you use pre-made  tomato sauce 😂. The best “in the world”, is everything you make from scratch sir.
Hint, don't try and talk when hammering or running any kind of kitchen machinery!
sorry but I think it is far away from being the best marinara sauce, it may be good but not the best, you didn't use San Marzano tomatoes which are the best also use a wine that it is not use for marinara, chianti, san giovesi or even pinot grigio would have been much better, it is my personal opinion.
I grew up in a family where you never "ate" out of your cooking. Sure, you taste your food you cooked, but sticking the whole spoon in your mouth than putting it back into the dish is just gross. As Simon Cowell would say, "It's a no for me."
You have a very nice voice, reminds me of Ron Pearlman!
I figured the worlds best sauce would use fresh tomatoes but boxed tomatoes are cool I guess lol
No salt no pepper?
Where’s the seafood?
Amazing recipe. Navy cook here just writing down a bunch of recipes for the crew and I. We really enjoyed this one and used it to make many more recipes.  Keep it up chef and thank you from all of us on the uss Oklahoma city. 🙏
do Italians use those cuisinart appliances?  or do they chop with a knife?
You got a kangan machine!
I will try this recipe! Simple 😁 Thankyou! -from Philippines
The best Italian sauce I’ve ever had was at Joes Italian Restaurant in Brooklyn. The chef wouldn’t share the family recipe but I wonder if the Marsala wine is what makes the difference? I’m going to try your recipe!! I hope it’s just as good.
Can you use a different red wine if you have it?
PARMALAT SUCKS!  4 months from retirement... (Parmalat USA) goes belly up!  Cooked their books like ENRON did!  I will NEVER support a product from them.
No salt?
Naaa
Basil while it's cooking is great if you like basil. Add more at the end if needed. I've seen northern italians use butter, onions. You know what? Who's eating it? Are you selling it?  Then make it the way your family likes it!! SMH! Enjoy, have a glass of wine!
Wow! You simmer it for 1 and 1/2 hours?! That sounds like a lot! Does it not reduce too much an become crazy-thick after so long??
Wow! That looked so easy! I'll have to try it out with my family!
Marsala wine is too expensive . Could you suggest any other wine instead of the marsala wine? Thank you
Why ya breathing like that homie?
buy a wooden spoon that noise is atrocious
Here’s a tip from an amateur: don’t use a metal utensil to stir in a metal pan or pot. It scratches the container and ruins it. Plastic is better, wooden is best.
You’re not good at this
Bone ape tit. Or as the eskimo's say it: Buon appetito!
you can use in on anything... even makes your car shine. :)
Coock the uniun and put in a litle whiine
You like making music with your food processor as well? ;)
World's best accourding to who? ;) Yourself? :D
QUIZANARD.....sounds like a retarsed fart🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
First off, never put onions and herbs together in a food processor. Additionally, never, ever put basil in the food processor. Third, never use the food processor on onions as it will create an uneven job and release a bitterness that is not present in a properly sliced or diced onion. Both of these items should be chopped by hand.  I didn’t even bother watching it after that catastrophe.
I like Prego bitch!
Grape , Roma’s are great . Spice as u like , never tried Marsala wine yet , but Ur pomi hint was great.👍tried it , ur right .
The husband is from Italy.  All his aunts make their sauce different.  No one way is right.
You're in subscription collector, not a "bold chef". Don't waste viewers precious time.
As chef you should know you never use metal on metal.. that is a big no no .. unless you like eating metal shavings
Guy is a moron
No salt... Can I add salt to mine? Or would it spoil the  flavor?
When I order anything takeout, that marinara sausce it's nasty. They need to watch your recipe!
He sounds drunk
Wonderful recipe! I dont care if you drag a backhoe, a cross that pan. All that matter's is, that good....lol
Hi sir i am reyansh, I always loved your videos especially this one, i have a request pls, can u share all ingredients used to make it, thanks in advance
ok you can cook your pasta like you prefer it. but please don't call it italian marinara sauce... the authentic marinara is with oregano not with basil... ond pleeease if you use basil for tomato sauce then at the end!
Lol why are you bending over
BORING AND SLOW VID, but recepie kinda cool
He taste the sauce and then puts the spoon back in the bowl!!!! How gross.
I actually bought and drank Marsala wine in Marsala in Sicily, and it is the strongest wine i ever had. It is excellent for cooking as well.
amateur cook
I made some with fresh tomatoes and white wine.
I just watched the marinara sauce recipe on Easycooking and then came to your channel for the same and you mentioned Easycooking chef liking canned tomatoes...I am spooked.. Guess the world is even smaller on YouTube..
is that an italian stove?
I’m sorry but this was not “making marinara sauce”. All you did was heat already made sauce with spices.....If you want to make marinara you get fresh whole, plum, or peeled tomatoes. You can either crush them by hand, puree them, or dice and boil them. Add 1sup red wine, 1 cup sugar, chopped parsely, whole basil, onions if you like, I use a whole red pepper. I don’t eat peppers but I love the flavor so I take the whole pepper out when I’m done cooking. You bring your chopped garlic, olive oil, butter,  and a shot glass of either brandy or a fine liquor to bring out the flavor of the fresh 🍅’s. You said in the beginning was right, marinara is all about fresh tomatoes, but then you dumped in tomato sauce from a box. If possible you get your tomato’s that day, if at all possible from a local farm or farmers market. And I’ve found the Amish have the freshest organic tomato’s. Your 🍅’s don’t have to be “Italian”, just as fresh as possible. Having a tomato grow in Italy makes it no better than growing in your back yard. If not making a meat sauce I try and still at least use some type of pork flavor ie. bacon grease or fry up some pancetta or prosciutto and let the fat separate. The fresher all ingredients and the better quality.....organic/non gmo....will make the best sauce/gravy.....Tomatoes from a jar/can/box could get you slapped in my family.....if your using canned or jarred “tomato sauce” then it’s their sauce not yours. All your doing is adding ingredients. Getting your tomato’s the right consistency is what makes a tomato sauce authentic and “yours”.
sweet Marsala wine?
Trust me, I've made my homemade sauce for yrs. Not one complaint. Have a friend from Naples that loved it. No, not Naples FL, lol.
I, personally, would heat olive oil in a pot. Add garlic, then add onion and let it sweat careful to not burn the garlic. Then I would add crushed tomatoes, dried spices; oregano, basil and parsley. Let it cook on low for about 45 minutes and then add FRESH oregano and Basil. NEVER use fresh in the beginning stages of your sauce. Finally, towards the end, I'll add a pinch of salt and pepper. Secret ingredient...sugar. it cuts the acidity of the tomatoes.
This is the biggest joke. I'm not even going to start to educate you on how a real marinara sauce is made in Italy. Why? Anybody who calls himself a chef and uses an electric range and not fire is not worth teaching anything to
No fresh garden tomato = INSTANT FAIL..... go to McDonald's
A note preperation of sause starts from 2:20 better to skip
The guy said Eye-talian. Nobody ever came or lived in a place called Eye-taly. If he doesn't even know how to say it, how can he cook it. Cooking well is all about the details. He is a total fail.
Food is food even if you overemphasize your Italian ingredients.
San marzano....
How's about a video actually showing how make sauce. Not how to use Wal-Mart to ghetto make sauce
I like to keep my dollars local and not outsource my food ingredients so I will continue to buy and use local homegrown ingredients. Tired of you soothsaying to people to buy Italian!   Buy USA people! Local is even better or homegrown where you can control the quality of soil!   Traitors these people!
You need to use a Wooden Spoon to make it Italian to stur the Sauce etc.
I love & use the Pomi Box Tomatoes all of the time they are just as good or better than the San Canned tomatoes from Italy etc. & Plus they are way less expensive etc.
"If that ain't Italian, I would grow some hair" lmao
Glen you rock!
He pronounces it "Quesi-nard" ... >_< lol
What is the name of the tomato puree on your video and do I have to special order it or is that available in local markets?  THANK YOU
Chef, see a chiropractor about that neck.   I have been making marinara for 20 years and always let the wine /onions and garlic boil off before adding the tomatoes and basil.  I am going to try your method here and see if it adds a better taste dimension. Thank you for the video.
This is not the Italian way of making marinara! Never use a blender!!😡You chop all your veg, pour in a CAN of tomatoes into an olive oiled pan. I can hear the Italian mafia "talking", lol!
no its not
If you have normal tomatos do you have to boil and then mash them please answer
gross no salt
that sauce will taste like nothing but basil. you only need a few leaves at the very end when you take it off the heat
"marinara" if I'm not mistaken suggests some sort of "marine"  component  thus.anchovies.  if you need to placate the veg heads, serve them tomato sauce. but calling it marinara sauce does not make sense. oh yeah  always add fresh basil just before serving.
amatuer
Wine is not available in pakistan what should i do??
To all the people who are writing negative comments about his sauce… I would like to know if any of you have actually made this sauce? How do you know this is a terrible recipe if you've never tried it? Just because you make the sauce in a different way does not mean that his sauce is not delicious as well! In order to critique someone else's recipe you must try it first otherwise it's just an assumption.... and even then what might be considered delicious to one person might be disgusting to another.
/ack
First, let me introduce myself I am Julie Oakes, So I have a question,  the tomato sauce you used is not readily available where I am, what would be your second pick?   Answer when you can.  Thank you
when I saw you use the tomatoes packed in a box as ingredient I stopped the video. the real sauce most use fresh and real tomatoes without extra preservatives .
This is my kind of sauce.  I'm not a fan of chunky sauces, gotta be rich and smooth.
Why is this sauce called marinara?
Stop the camera and in the edit cut yourself out for a more fluid video.  Great recipe.
what a rip off
we not in Italy👈we don't have Italian tomato😉🙄
Never trust a man with an electric stove.
maybe he went bald because he's a bad chef
yo that bowl is about to fall off the friggin table
I like to fry the onions with garlic first.
What kind of tomatos are italian?
Let's see what chef Ramsay has to say about this.
the taco bell of italian sauce
Chef card pulled.
ok...here we go...Depending on Qty,,,but let me give you the basics, for a true, sweet, Marinara SAuce... Organic Carrot, One Onion Quartered, Fresh Plum Tomatoes, skins off (St Marzano), Tomato Puree...Olive oi, Rough Chopped Garlicl and Basil. Cold Pan...Olive Oil to cover base...Garlic and Basil(basil un chopped, as it comes) turn heat onto LOW and let simmer to LIFE....add Onion and Carrot, to start heating process,,,after 10 minutes, put Tomato's in...simmer for maybe 2 hours...stir in between...let rest for say...45 minutes. sieve out all the carrot, onion, basil and stuff...now you should have a lovely Tomato Sauce...this is better the next day, after leaving in the fridge...but you'll find, you cant wait, as this sauce...is ADDICTIVE...make at your own risk...you may never eat another sauce. This is a well kept recipe, from very special Moma's over time...enjoy, because food is enjoyable and should be enjoyed and honoured. my gift, to people who love tom sauce :)
Did this stunod just say "eye-talian"?
Here's a clue for all you critical & hateful commenters; if you like your marinara sauce chunky...make it chunky. If you like it spicy, make it spicy...but stop being so rude! My parents made their's very much like this and it was authentic and handed down from their parents from Italy & Sicily...it was exactly this consistency and everyone loved it and wanted their recipe...so... Don't like this recipe...simple...move on and STFU! Sheezzz!
Interesting...I was just thinking of using Marsala wine in my spaghetti sauce instead of white...nice touch of sweetness.
Chef what does the Marsala wine do? Thank you for the recipe.
Throw in some sardines bitch..
Bald Chefs never leave hair in your food . Always a plus in my book
I made this tonite and it is the best sauce i've ever made. I used it for a chicken pasta bake.  Who would have thought just a simple pesto sauce is all you need. I'm a subscriber.
Would you show how to make marinara sauce with fresh tomatoes...???  instead tomatoes out of a can or a cartoon.....
This looks very good.
Sorry, bad sound, bad pronunciation Italian, and What happened to "fresh tomatoes"???  Using a blender is a deal killer for me, so I quit the video at that point.  Nothing personal.
Working at an Italian restaurant i have to make the marinara sauce and never would i make it this way. I leave the basil until after the cooking. the onions i cook first with oil then put in the mic of chopped up  carrots, celery, garlic and anchovies. Marinara sauce needs anchovies. I let it cook for about 5 hours and customers love it so much.
Glen, you double-dipped your spoon, bro.
fight me IRL.
I love me some good marinara sauce. :)
get to the doctor mate was expecting you to pass out with the weezing. that said I'm going to go searching for those tomatoes now. love from Scotland:)
How long will this last in the refrigerator if stored?
I am a Greek and I want to ask you.if  i  can replace the marsala wine..with a Greek vine..If you know of course.Thnx!
I like your marble utensil holder!
fresh tomatoes! your the man!
Nice!
the reason I wrote is because you used Marsala in your sauce. So I now you are either an Italian chef or know one.
QweezahNard? Does Walmart carry those? Just joking. I use hunts crushed tomatos and Cento tomato paste for my daily driver marinara. But use Pomi (60%) and Cento D.O.P. San Marzano (40%) for seafood dishes that call for tomato sauce. Thats the combo knockout punches we dealt in a very successful busy azz hotel.
you've got me sold but the comments have me on the fence
he didn't bother to crush the red pepper flakes, just sprinkled 'em straight on in, guess it doesn't matter
Mare in italian means "sea/ocean" - Marinara therefore means "ocean-style sauce". We have Marinara in Italy. Its usually some kind of tomato sauce with mostly either shrimp or sardines in it. I LOVE the tomato sauce recipe, convinced it tastes great....but where is the fish? btw pls don't blend basil - the more u chop it, the more flavour it looses - rip it with ur fingers.
this recipe ain't healthy because of the wine i added apple vinegar it's much healthier .
You just got two boxes of tomato sauce, what the hell?
1,5 hour! Thats a bit long man. Does the taste increase after 15 minutes or are you just dehydrating it?
You're going to break your chopper.
No measurements, very confusing.
Why is everything Italian?
can i use italian seasoning in marinara sauce?
Hey Chef I don't know how this sauce taste, but I have to point out dude that every good chef knows to have a number of CLEAN spoons when tasting...I can't believe you double dipped...
The sound of that metal spoon sux bad dude
Thank you for your recipe! Since i cannot find this sauce, what other regular brand would you suggest me to buy? Thanks you chef!
I stopped watching when I saw the colour of the 'extra' virgin olive oil, even tough I should have stopped when I saw the blender.
The recipe looks great, I just wish that the ingredients and measurements used would be on the description box. Because for someone who doesn't cook often measurements are important.
looks good
Have you been drinking alchohol?
can I use fresh tomatoes in marinara sauce

can I use fresh tomatoes in marinara sauce
thanks Chef
Had to come back for leaving a review, honestly it was delicious even though I didn't add the exact amount needed👌 Thanks again👍🏻
You know you guys on the east coast do things differently than us Diego's due in the Midwest, all you need is Stanislaus products not some junk in a milk container. Really it looks kind of gross , Alta Cucina  is the best product out there to make real marinara are 6/1 by Escalon I am in the food industry both Wholesale and retail and I am just putting my two sense in. By the way is that a mainland Italy recipe are Sicilian.
Chef, I'm really concerned that you sound so out of breath.  I have my own health concerns.  Love your recipe!
What the hell did I just see.  Did not cook the garlic, did not cook the onion.  Food processor basil?  What is this nonsense?  Garbage cookery.
I used the same tomatoes, but had a lot of water coming out of the sauce, what did I do wrong?
Thats about as Italian as Macdonalds Bald Chef. I suggest you go to Italy or read ITALIAN cookery books such as the SILVER SPOON. Not American books that think they are italian
Nice
My favorite part of this video is the sd501
If you have a space for a garden, you have got to grow Fresh San Marzano Tomatoes, I was paying up to $5-$6 per 28oz can of imported San Marzano. Now I grow only 3 plants per season, and not only do I yield enough for 5-6 meals during the short summer, but I am able to quick freeze them right after harvesting, make sauce and canned tomatoes. I have enough Sauce, Stewed Toms and crushed that last me well through into the upcoming season. and it only costs the price of the Non GMO variety seed packet, plus your time. You will not be sorry. A tip for those who have any questions, San Marzano Tomatoes like an ashy, volcanic type of soil. This mimics the growing conditions from the old country. I have used organic soil, and added the ash and sulfur products to get close. These plants grow towards the sun, and they keep producing throughout the season, unlike most other variety's that all ripen about the same time. If you don't have the space for a garden, no problem. I have used and still do a 5 gallon pot or bigger, same soil conditions, and 8+ hours of sun. I have gotten approx. 2/3 the same production, as I get from the garden plants. So it well worth it!
You are boss, bald chef! Tried this for the first time and my family devoured it! It was sooo good. I ate spaghetti and meatballs at an eatery in the Northeast and this sauce took me back to that place. I plan to make a huge batch next time. Thank you for sharing your gift with the rest of us....
that oil, does not have olives lol, probably it's the counterfeit one (a bit of olive oil with sunflower seed oil), that's way to clear, way to clear to be even a olive oil!
This looks really delicious  but any way to make it slightly thicker without added corn starch or arrow root?
does the kind/type of tomato make a difference? You mentioned Plum but would others work just as well?
What can I use to substitute the wine? Do I just leave it out completely or is there anything I can use to replace it?
this man looks like gold burg
No oregano that's weird for Italian sauce.
i'm from italy and never would i think that "marinara" is just a pomodoro sauce. lol :/
Just made this Glen. Yep you were right best ever!!!!
Looks great---I will make this week-end----Thank you for sharing
Ok, Rogaine is an option. Hair club for men. Just saying, you are on the right page but in a different language. One of a thousand Italians from New York maybe......not Italy. It's nice to know you're confident in the "best in the world" Marinara, but let's start off with some language, like "marinara" is nothing more than lingo where as the true name would be Sugo Pomodoro. We're not sailors so let us Americans get off that kick of calling all red sauce a "marinara." Then we'll take a big step away from tomato sauce and try some real tomatoes like whole DOP tomatoes AKA "San Marzano's" never, ever buy and use a purée. Not that I'm an Italian chef or anything ;) I'm just saying, don't do it. The only comparable tomato in the U.S. Is the Alta Cucina but that product is generally only offered to wholesale to restaurants. That's only a debate on the ingredients, talking technique would take some time but worth your attention. Then after you make these major improvements, change the title of the video from "best in the world, to a good Sugo Pomodoro." After all, we are Italian and we can be proud without having to manipulate potential viewers with obviously inadequate information
This looks really delicious. I've added this recipe to my list. I do have a question though. Some brands of marinara sauce seem to be very acidic and need some sugar to offset it. Is this due to the type of tomatoes used or is it just a 'preference' in taste?
My moms secret was she used 3 or 4 different kinds of fresh tomatoes, coarse ground peppercorns and sea salt.
looks good Chef Pelon ( bald chef)
I love the recipe, thanks a lot for sharing.
Looks pretty tasty! I would've done it just a bit different tho!
All Italian cooks would always use a Wooden spoon to stur their sauce.? Never a metal spoon.?Something about the wood.? Give it a better tasting sauce.?
San Marzano's only. Also, putting a spoon from your mouth to the bowl is like growing your own germ culture.  Extremely bad habit even if you do not share your fridge contents.
i dont like marsala wine in my marinara sauce  dont taste right
Can you use Salt n Pepper instead on basil?
I stopped watching when you started dragging that metal spoon through the sauce. Need to get your self a nice wooden spoon.
eye talian ?
Just made this Recipe today with spaghetti it was Delicious the only thing I had to substitute was the Tomatoes where I live they don't carry the Plum tomatoes you have or Plum tomatoes of another brand I used the Hunts diced tomatoes All Natural but if you recommend another alternative I would love to try it for next time Ilive in a small town not very many options such as NY etc I have in Albertsons and Winco grocery stores where I am from
A tip: add the fresh basil in the last few minutes of cooking.
Thanks man, your video had a good pace to it, made the deliciousness really come through my screen!  Trying to make chicken parmesan tonight
Nice. Am I the only person to use fish sauce ( to replace salt) in my Marinara?
Hey thanks!
its It talian !
eye Talian
Amen! I love u brother and stay on it....I'm with you all the way....
an old italian lady said that if a sauce doesnt have tomato puree, its not sauce. Need the tomato puree to thicken the sauce and give it body . i agree
If you ever wanted to cook great Italian marinara sauce I got the recipe to make the best
What's the difference between marinara and pomodoro sauces?
Why not by plum tomatoes then? Roast or scald them? Weakness
Hi Chef,  What would you recommend more? Pesto sauce or the fresh basil for this? Thanks!

Bald chef?

he put back the spoon into the bowl  !!  LOL!!  but it looks delicious....thanks..
Hi, Chef! Tried one of your recipes recently, loved it. I'm curious: My marinara sauce recipe is almost identical to yours (minus the crushed red peppers and the Marsala [which both turned out well on the last one!] and I use crushed, peeled Italian tomatoes. Your thoughts on the difference between using the crushed tomatoes vs. the sauce?
I'm going to have to try this.  I notice your Kangen machine, it's great for cooking:)
Marinara cooks fast, i.e., in less then 30 minutes and is generally chunky. Also, you always saute your garlic and onions in the olive oil before adding any tomato product. A Sunday sauce is a slow cooked product, usually taking anywhere from an hour and half up to two and a half ours (depending on who's doing the cooking). How do I know? I'm a freaking Italian.
Great sauce I will give this a try. And forget the haters )
Any other wines tried or is it just Marsala wine like for cooking
I can't wait to try it. I loved your beef stew.
When it comes to great Italian Marinara Sauce you got to ask what makes the best sauce? The way my Mother makes it , the way you like it, is it spicy , chunky or sweet. Well  This is what the Bald Chef Likes it a Spicy Sauce with Garlic, Basil, and Italian Plum Tomatoes.
that is the worst   marinara  sauce i never    see in my lifeeeee !!!!!.......
looks like shit to me
I kind of like chunky marinara though...
Thanks for giving my rendition of my Best Italian Marinara Sauce recipe a try. Looks like you doctored it up a bit but that's what cooking is all about.
I have used this Italian Marinara Sauce recipe for years and my friends call it good red! The San Marzano Tomatoes really kick this pasta sauce up a notch! Thanks for checking my recipe out.
I've never seen the San Marzano Tomatoes here in Michigan.  I'm going to have to search.  They sound like perfection!
This is terrific, I just made it and the family just finished eating.  I used about 2 dozen fresh roma tomatoes from the garden and a large can of store bought sauce instead of the type you had.  Added just a touch of brown sugar too.  And of course, topped with grated parmesaan.   Molto delizioso!
Thanks Chef! This may not be the sauce that some people like. But to me and any one's who has had my Italian recipes agrees this is the best recipe for Italian Marinara Sauce.
great recipe glen thanks for sharing...
Well there is no fight here many great Italian cook and chefs believe  Oregano is a must have spice in any great Marinara Sauce. And you may be right. But for me I don't think  Oregano and Basil mix well. Chose one or the other and I always go with Basil as be the best herb to complement tomato. To each his own, thanks for your comment and keep on cooking!
No oregano in an Italian Marinara sauce??? Blasphemy!
Thanks for you comment on my best Italian Marinara Sauce recipe. This recipe has what it it takes to be the best Italian Marinara Sauce : Imported tomatoes like San﻿ Marzano, Garlic, Basil, Olive Oil, and a tease of dried  Italian hot pepper flakes. cook up a pot of this sauce and you will see why it's the best!
Sounds so good natural light cooker her and yoe SAN MARZANO ARE THE BEST
The truth will set you free these  San Marzano Tomatoes would be the best tomatoes to make a great Italian Marinara Sauce recipe. The next time I cook up a batch of my Sunday Gravy I will absolutely give this brand a try! You can't get more Italian than these. No salesman here just the facts, love comments like this!
before you imagine that I am selling something, research it yourself, San Marzano tomatoes are a type of tomato grown in Italy, very carefully regulated by the Italian government and considered by most professionals to be the best tomato in the world.
Manuel I may not be to sharp, but try to tell me in a simple sentence what you are saying about this  Italian Marinara Sauce.
tomato frehs were??????
This Italian Marinara sauce recipe has yum written all over it! The sauce is easy to cook and tastes great on all kinds of pasta. Thanks for your comment!
I love this Italian Marinara sauce it's got a lot going for it! The main thin is making good Sunday gravy is using a good quality Italian plum tomato imported from Italy, garlic, and basil.  If you start with this 3 basic items in you tomato sauce you can't go to wrong. I love this recipe and yes it was mighty tasty! Thanks again for your comments and great support.
Salt? all that needs in some fried cheese to drag through it!!!
Every Italian thinks they have their Sunday gravy or marinara sauce.  The truth is people all have don't have the same taste buds and what one sauce my hit the spot. for one guest but next guest may find it to be Chef Boyardee's best. When people taste marinara sauce they are looking for 4 factors sweetness or spiciness, chunky or smooth sauce. My Marinara sauce tends to be spicier than most other Italian tomato sauces.
I always used﻿ Italian plum tomatoes in my Sunday Gravy. Then Richard Blaine at Mr EZ Cooking turned me on to the Pomi boxed plum tomato Italian sauce. It's better than my old brand and it is easy to use. I found it in a local shopping store, I don't think Safeway has it. But next to fresh plum tomatos it makes a great Marinara sauce.
Marinara Italian  Sauce made with Pomi does not need much salt but if you want some salt, not to good for me, add some salt it would kick this pasta sauce up !
Looks good! No salt added? I would have thought it would need some
