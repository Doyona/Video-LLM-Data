Thank you for making this so simple!
This video was perfect, this was the first fan Ive ever installed and I was able to do it without issue. Thank you for taking the time to make this video
That fan is beautiful!
I’m installing five of these in my house. The instruction manual says to remove the rubber stopper before attaching the fan blades or testing the motor. I can’t find a rubber stopper anywhere. Am I missing something?
Bigggg help
I’m getting a scraping sound as the fan turns. I’ve tightened all bolts. Any ideas?
I install it but when i turn on fan my fan is shacking during work how to stop shaking it?
Any help after install? Fan was working great for about a week and now make very loud humming and whooping sound. It I hold the light kit part with my hand it stops the noise.
Just done ✔  thanks

New subscriber! From my ceiling there’s only a white black and blue  cable hanging.. the blue cable has a sticky note that says for light??
I have an extra green wire from the ceiling. Any ideas ? Or just leave it with a nut wire
Installed this fan and the grey wire is not connected to anything and the fan doesn’t spin but can hear the motor! Know where this only grey wire connects to?
Does it come with a remote control?
He really used the motor housing as a hat lmao😂
