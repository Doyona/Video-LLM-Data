Great video Thanks
Need a plastic liner or the wood is going to rot
Since you have the rails running along the sides, wouldn't you gain in planter depth if, instead of putting the bracers across, you put the fence board directly onto the rails, perpendicular to how you have them? That is, the fence boards take  the place of the bracers. It looks like the unsupported length of the fence board would actually be less running rail-to-rail than across the bracers.
Awesome thanks for sharing🥰
My adventure with the tree began with projects from Woodbex.
Doesn't the wood rot?
Thank you!... after watching 7 videos, this is the best...
Brilliant ✨.. Watching from Sudan
Iama try on a small scale for indoors
Just done this - thankyou buddy your help was invaluable as I worked my way through it. From Yorkshire, UK
I built one last year and it turned out great!!!! I plan on building 2 more this year. By no means am I a skilled craftsman, but these instructions were easy to follow and the finish product turned out great. I am even going a little crazy this year and looking to try to add an elevated back for a glass panel to cover and create a little greenhouse out it.
Stodoys has very good and accurate plans.
Try the best carpenters and woodworkers plans. Stodoys.
I started with Woodglut plans.
I bought Woodglut once and now I have lifetime access to thousands of woodworking projects.
Hi fellows. I think you need to take some time and take a fast tour on Woodglut website.
Quick easy access to many projects with Stodoys plans.
Just did my first ever project, kinda followed your build, but changed dimensions up a bit.  Turned out super sturdy and i am amazed I managed to do it, thanks to you :)  Got the bug now.  Thanks
Beautiful ...love this 😊
Just made one ......not a carpenter at all and didn’t have any power tools ....so all cut by hand  .....but once you’ve cut the pieces .....easy to put together ......quite happy with .......great clip
Hi, will the wood not rot?
Εύγε νέε μου...!!! BRAVO...!!!
simple and elegant! Thank!
Just finished building this! It’s my first time ever building anything, so it turned out kinda bad, but I’m pretty proud of it nonetheless.
You are awesome!! Indeed!! Thanks a million
Thanks for keeping it simple
great video - you make it look easy.  One question: what brand is the support you use in addition to the Black & Decker work table?  I'm really interested in getting one like yours...
Alternatively, screw the ends flush to the legs first so the front boards cover the ugly end grain.
Can you , guys , recommend easy to use , not heavy saw for a female with not much experience .. I am sorry , someone advised to go to amazon, but I don't know even wbat to look for.  I want to start working with wood Making simple boxes for plants and such.  Thank.you so much
To the original video owner: what kind of saw do you use, can you post the brand and model, please? How heavy is it ?
Does anyone know the amount of materials and the sizes to make this? Gonna make one for my  mother for Mother’s Day / her birthday
Just made this! Gunna build another this weekend now that I know what I’m doing better. Thanks for the ideas!
what is that thing called thats to the side of your workbench that keeps the wood supported while you cut it?
ok believe I found it this is a 3ftx1ft box. got it. Off to make my boxes. Thanks for the simple plan.
Thank you for the video. I was just in the need for herb boxes. I found all the material saved from scrap pile. The only thing missed is the length of the end boards (3ft long x ? wide).  Would ya mind sending that my way? I know I should be able to figure it out. I 'll re-watch to see if I can.
I'd like to know the Fence board dimensions. They look about  6" high I guess? and not sure how thick. I can see that if you do a 3 x 1 planter like this, but your fence boards or decking boards are different widths or heights, even by half inch, you'll end up needing to cut down your base boards more to fit, which will get fiddly. In the video example, the planter at 3x1 is exactly the right width for two fence boards with no cutting (other than around the legs), so knowing which size fence boards to buy is important.
where do you buy the clamps from?
Man, this looks so easy...I want to try, but I don't have any tools, and no car to get lumber home. Bleh.
Yeah, Adam, if you could just build a few for me, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks. 🤣
Yes, something my novice skills can handle. Thank you!  Prior YT videos had me defeated, they may as well have been Step.1 Be a Carpenter Step.2 Have an unattainable array of tools, unless you’re carpenter.  Appreciate your unassuming simplicity for the average person to follow, cheers!
What kind of screws do you use? I saw 1 5/8” length but not sure “what kind”. Construction? Deck? Tried matching the color but can’t determine...
Sure you don’t want to throw in some hurricane straps and some TJIs just to make sure those Herbs and flowers can withstand wind sheer and snow load?
Thanks! I built one of these today, this was the easiest guide I could find, cheers!
i just made 3 today.
עבודה מצויינת 👏👏👏❤️
What are the dimensions of the fence board you are using?
Obviously there is no set number, but what price range would you figure this project costs for the wood part only? Thanks for the great video!
What are the dimensions of the fence board
He didn't take the plants off the plastic container. 😂
Crap box
How far apart should the screws be?
Is very simple Bu i Love it I made it smaller  😛 thanx
This guy looks like a douche but thanks for the video
These came out really well. Thank you!
Good video but you should show more (and better) angles of the box. Was a bit hard to follow in the middle
Good job thaks so much
Like that!
would be better to cover end grain with longer sides, would look more profesional
Add hinges and a top and you have a toy box or storage bench
That's raw wood. Wouldn't it rot since nothing separates it from the soil? Also, wouldn't the water sweep through the gaps between each plank of wood?
Don't think your insurance company would insure that box, bro...you need to line it with plastic sheeting so it lasts longer than a year. But then this is really about what you're selling and not about what you're building.
I made it by myself. I used woodprix scripts for that.
What about the spacing in between the wooden planks? Will the water not leach out?
Awsome video! Quick question would the water damage the wood overtime?
the wood is water resistent or not?
thanks. made one in a couple hours for a neighbor. She was very happy.
Excellent job …. thank you .
Did you wear that tool belt just for that hammer?
eye protection shouldn't involve sunglasses that basically dim your vision of the tools and wood you're working with, but you look cool !
Thank you, I was worried about the quality of my workmanship, now I feel much better and my design a bit easier as I need no bottom as they will stay put.
Hi folks. I have a question. I see he did not use anything before putting a soil. On some videos,I see some ppl stich the plastic inside the box,other stich the fabric. Plus drilling the holes. Which you would suggest,plastic,fabric,or none? Big thanks!
I like growing erbs
Great build mate! Keep creative! 🔧👌🔨
Kapa update
Love it, love it, love it!!! Thanks for the video 😊
Nice planter and the video helps a lot ! 😀
Thanks bro.  Just finished making one for my lady.  She really loves it.
Adam. You legend mate. I told the old ball and chain that I was gonna landscape the garden at the weekend. Cor blimey she was chuffed when she saw this. Creme de la creme. Top banana you're a top lad. Great bants. Ever in the UK, I'll take ya out for a cheeky nandos boyo!
It's funny how he says to wear ppe but he isn't wearing ear protection
I made one today, but after putting the 2 rails in between the legs on both side I just use 11 inch slats along the Tao. Left some area between each one. I’ll put garden fabric on top.
just what i'm searching for... you make my day
🙋🏻‍♂️🌹
Thanks for this video. This is the simplest and strongest planter box I've seen. As a novice this is something I think I can build
Wouldn't it have been jist as fine to use some mulch on the bottom and then soil?
Nice job!
I like that idea you the man
So, I've been curious. I'm no DIY expert or wood expert, but is there no additional protection needed for the wood to stop it from rotting or molding?
Other than 2x2, we don't have any dimensions??
What type of wood are your fence boards  And your 2”x2” ? Do you have a list of all the materials you using & the equipment we need to put the planter box together?
What type of wood are your fence boards  And your 2”x2” ? Do you have a list of all the materials you using & the equipment we need to put the planter box together?
Thank you, I think I will build 3 of these!
i really dont have speakers for my computer rn does he include how much everything would be.. im only suggesting putting side clips of supplies an such for next video pretty please with words xD
Thanks for the plan layout! I just had someone a fence recently and hope to upcycle the old pickets and 4x4 poles. As a novice, I don't have all the necessary tools here (no bench, no vises), but I'll see if I can make by with a borrowed reciprocating saw, a tape measure, and some nails.
THANK YOU SO MUCH .!! TY TY TY!!
Nice video! Check out my planter box tutorial! https://youtu.be/XVxD0S1EfFI
You are the best 👍🏻
Bragh, Thank you so much for this video! Planting rows of white sage for spring & summer! Fannkks. <3
these do not seem to be deep enough,I think they need more soil ?
The only mistake: Deck oil on it and a few layers, if not...in a year time it is dead...pity.
I just made this, an exact replica. Thanks for the walkthrough!
Hi fellows. I think you need to take some time and take a fast tour on stodoys
You might want to line the inside of the box with some plastic. It'll keep the wood from getting moldy
Your are so sexcy
It does the job, but you really need to learn doing it better or learn to doing they it should be! 👎👎👎👎
Safety first 💪
Good job, but just wanted to make a comment on this. You should have added a plastic sheet between the soil and the wood. The water from the soil will destroy all your hard work in just few years of time   Anyways good work mate
This does not work if you use true 6 inch wide boards.  The boards that lay in the bottom will not fit because together they will be 12 inches across and you have less space than that inside.  So either cut your end boards a little longer than 12 inches, or you will have to rip the edges off your bottom boards.
beautiful
Thank you for sharing your knowledge and am now proceeding to build my box....I also have to agree with comment regarding nothing in tool belt etc, guess you should watch video again, he did have a hammer on belt, I thought that was a tool? Was when I went to school....Great video, nice easy instructions and step by step guide..keep it up..cheers
Nice 🙆
good job! I also like how you emphasized safety. :)
Finally, a great plan for novice DIYer, thank you!!
Now I wonder why people spend $70 for a planter when you can easily build it for $10? I will try it! :)
That looks awesome I would like to build  3 of them 4  legged post vertical, and your a little hottie.
The wood will get bad from the water
What they don't tell you is that thid box is going to fade and rot in as time goes by. They'll look hideous. Try composite.
waaaay overcomplicated
Solid base, no liner?  If you can afford a really expensive hardwood you may get 5 years out of it otherwise 18 months at best.  You do realise not everyone lives in dry sunny places yes?
"Let me show you how it's done "     1st  make sure you have $1000 worth of power tools......OH  they edited that bit out......
That's not cedar, that's pressure treated.  Also you should not use pressure treated to plant vegetable plants.  Also, the way you are set up to cut your boards, you are looking at a possible bind with your circular saw.  You shouldn't be cutting between two supports.
Hi check theses builds out https://youtu.be/1tvKSSCpxLo
How can he see with Stevie wonder glasses on?
Did he just place the whole plant (pot and all) in the soil and cover it up! lol
Tried Stodoys instructions?
Thanks for this simple how to. I think I'm going to make 2 of them half the size that you made lol. I suck at using power tools so I'm just gonna give the measurements to the guy at the home improvement store and have him cut them lol.  Tip for viewers: If you don't have a power saw you can write the measurements down and take them to your local home improvement store and they'll cut the wood for you (if you buy the wood from them they might even do it for free!).
I have made four already... Everyone loves it... Thanks man... Gonna make some more... :)
I was going to ask if your Canadian because you sound like an NHL player then I saw your T-shirt
That looks really cool👌 I just made plant tubs with 5mm steel. I welded it together and after I applied vinegar. It started to rust after. Looks also very beautifull.👌
Do we need waterproof paint for it?
Adam this is a very good demonstration, however, it would be great to know all of your measurements and all of the tools need to duplicate this project
Built this and turned out great. Lumber used:  6 x 4' 1x4 cedar boards 2 x 8' - 2x2 cedar  brown deck screws varathane satin to protect the wood  Instead laying the 2 - 3' deck boards on the bottom, I cut them the other way in 12" sections. This gives an extra 1.5" of soil depth in the planter
nice easy and efficient. i would still opt for anti-rot chemicals and put a foil barrier between the wood and soil, to prevent leakage of chemicals into the soil.
The best thing I've found on the net was plans from stodoys.
Built this and worked/looked great!  I made the long edges 4 ft instead of 3 ft and worked just as well.  Thanks!
great vid can i get measurments and what materials i need
plant box technicality motive ,zyra
i like how he glossed over the hard parts :)
+Cottage Life DIY Thanks for sharing, makes it very easy to make with this video! One should consider using un-treated lumber due to the harsh chemicals. Perhaps Cedar or Redwood could be a good choice? Cheers
Do We Need Any Treatment To Protect Wood From Inside  ? ( I Believe You Did It With A Treated Wood )
why not use a liner?
thanks for sharing your great techniques' nice one :)
Cool video! Should you not put the soil in a plastic container? Will the wood not rot, being in contact with soil and water? Please advise.
Do you need to varnish the wood to protect it from rotting ?
keeping it nice and simple thanks
Great to see that WoodPriX has new instructions to save my money and energy to build it.
Why don’t you put some type of plastic in there to protect the wood?
Is there easy way to make one? I don't have all that tools :(
hi nice work. what kind of wood you are using?
Sorry without
No good with a plastic liner, school boy error
I made it with woodprix handbooks !
He over complicated the shit outta this project.... You can make this same thing in like 5 steps flat...
If you want you can learn from woodprix scripts how to make it yourself.
Wat about ear protecktion? aww shet.
I made it too very easy. just used WoodPrix plans and instructions.
I'm sure the best instruction is on WoodPrix website.
I think you need to take some time and go to woodprix website to learn how to make it.
I love this wood working book “pepe amazing plan” (Google it). Some of the topics reviewed in the book include woodworking methods, description on the growth cycles of trees, and various lumber characteristics which craftsmen favor. I also gave my father another copy.
So do it yourself , go to woodprix page and learn how .
Very nice ♥ :) I'm inspired to make one myself. Just need experience ;)
Do you think the 2x2"s could be made longer and used to make these planters double stacked?
This is why im afraid of posting videos of myself or my family because there is people who can be so hurtful. I wish my husband did projects like this. Awesome job! I want one for a fairy garden for my daughters play house.
Ok this is definitely the sexy side of gardening!
I made it by myself. I used woodprix scripts for that.
Cut 4 fence boards to 3 feet <-- 3 feet x what? How high?
Adam, what was your build time for this planter box. Just curious how many I can roll out in a day 😀
Great video, gonna get to it in my own garden. I'm hoping to make a longer one , aiming at 2m.
I just built a planter using these instructions but I used wood from free pallets, apart from the legs and horizontal supports at the bottom. Super cheap. I had to watch the video as I went along but it looks great!
Hey there . Very nice and easy to do. I like your working station. Could you tell me what is the name of that stand with a roll on it, the one you are using to lay the wood on it when you cut it . It looks that it helps a lot . Thank's
What are the measurements for the wood?
Should we be coating it with polyacrylic to keep the wood from water damage?
yeah. . looks so easy. love your tools tho. thanks
If you want you can learn from woodprix woodworking plans how to make it yourself.
if you want to learn how to make it yourself, just go to woodprix website. There you'll find your answers :)
I bought excellent handbook from woodprix website. Just google woodprix and start your journey to the better life
I can make it myself. Just got instructions from woodprix website and I'm ready for do it :D
I think mine looks better ;) I used woodprix instructions and I built it with no problem.
can you use a hand saw I don't have an electric saw
so that's what DB Sweeney is doing now after the Cutting Edge
I am pretty sure you can find good solutions on woodprix webpage :)
no water proofing of the board? the moist will eat up the wooden board.
You could use hardware cloth stapled to the bottom instead of using all of that extra wood. Then line that with landscape fabric.
Do  you need a water protection for  the wood?
Gosh this looks super easy and super cute to make it even myself. I got all those tools so why not. New project on my list! Thanks for the video 😊 another thing, why must people always scrutinize every video and pin point unnecessary things? So what if he wanted to wear an empty tool belt? It gives essence to the video. And yes, he didn't wear all the protective safety gear, he's just saying for YOU to wear it. Learn how to just be thankful for someone taking their time to do this.
can i plant two types of vegetables in my planter box as long as i seperate them to each side of the box?
"It could be loose, it could be snug."  Well that depends on how well you measure and cut :).  Oh,.... and for PPE, you're missing hearing protection and a dust mask.
Gertrude was right all along, I downloaded Woody Hyezmar’s woodworking plans, and boy do I have a great plan to build one of these!
Excellent, going to make some a planter box at the weekend 😀👏👌🏻
is that nick swardson...?
I wish the video told me exactly how much material I need. I looked at the plan on the website given, but it doesn't tell me exactly. I can deduce it from the video, but I'd rather not.
I like this plan
just do it yourself , go to woodprix page and turn your idea to reality.
Good job!
will the wood long lasting since it is not coated with paint?
love it
Make a flouting club house
You know the difference between us Brits and you Americans its the way we say "herbs" you say "erbs" and we say "herbs" because there's a fucking 'H' in it
I feel like you'll save yourself a whole bunch of time and money by just buying one from the store
Life Pro Tip: Did you know that you can actually put tools in your tool belt and not just wear it to look cool?
how many people watching actually live where bell-air direct insurance is available? seems like  pointless commercial to throw in
What's up
cant brojects make there own yt channel pliz
Can we get blueprints for the parts?
Nice and simple! Cool!
Whats up with all us construction  videos using super long screw-bits?
First one saying Thank You!

For those using this for herbs keep in mind what pants your putting together. A quick Google will give you tons of information. But an example is mint is a vine and will tend to choke out other plants around it. Rosemary is extremely potent and sometimes will cause other herbs to smell and take on its flavor.
