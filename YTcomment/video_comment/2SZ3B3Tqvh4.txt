I got rid of all the junk foods already and was looking for a proper diet plan.
What are the foods i should be eating regularly is it mostly vegetables?
Hey how can I lose weight and get abs what should I eat if I want to get abs
Nothing I didn't already know, but it sure is great for motivation!
* creatine does in fact reduce testicle size and lowers libido , first hand experience steak is a better choice.
The lady hands delicately grazing his washboard abs in black and white got me bro.  💀💀💀 I feel like I got transported into an Abercrombie photoshoot
making you big as hell
Rampage For Abs
1:50 "I used to eat enemies, I talked about this before, every morning, for breakfast!"  2:07 I don't eat any of their CRAP!"  Really liking this channel though, watch it every day!!! Thanks for all the great info!
2024
Is almond milk alr?
I went from overweight to anorexic and now i wanna achieve being in shape.
What should I eat if I want to lose weight and get abs and tone up and eat healthier anymore 😡😟it makes me made
How long will I’ll be able to come back after a 4 day cruise
Jeff literally said "let's talk like man"
Truely the only advice someone needs to achieve a six pack
wow last advice 100 points, bad food makes you happy but your body in a mirror too
good mine too I don’t support it either anymore and have a sixpack too
donats for breakfast is bad , healthy first then maybe sweet as a dessert
watching this while eating snickers
I’m 15 , I’ve heard supplements aren’t good for me, is it true ?
I got step 2 down pat
okay I'm trying to cut the crap as you say, Vegan hamburger is that good for you? energy drinks (no sugar/low cal and then cheese is any cheese healthy
Lol....why they bleep out the F word? Jeff has said it before and without bleeping it out  and rightfully so. YouTube being a hater. Jeff speaks the truth and is a blessing to the fitness industry!!❤
hellll yeah!!!!! This is exactly what i need to hear I really appreciate it
Jeff, how can I cut the crap when I get amazing sweets for Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, my birthday, and lots of other holidays?
I don’t agree with eating more often to stabilize blood sugar. Eating three meals a day I always felt tired in the afternoon, went to intermittent fasting and have more energy
Cool
I just don’t drink alcohol. That way I don’t have to worry if it’s “excess” or not 😉
I made the decision a while ago to cut right down on sugar and have been taking a daily meal replacement shake rhyming with fuel. Since then I no longer crave the sweet snacks and instead my energy comes from good carbs and fruit and vegetables. Big game changer. I drink green tea, even a teaspoon on cider apple vinegar in my pints of water whilst aiming to reach a daily target of 10k steps. The post gym cravings for crap have now gone and instead after my whey drink I reach for peanut butter on whole meal toast. I think once you adopt that mind set from the results you notice, it becomes habitual.
Great video
I only heard 30% of what he said, I was too distracted by his biceps
POV: Your tryna keep a healthy diet… at Christmas time
Thanks for the pep talk Jeff. I really appreciate your no-bullsh*t attitude.  Little changes are achievable. I screen-shot your "body fat %" picture for women on your website. Keeping it simple. Working on setting up new goals for 2023. 💥💪🏼
i am combining the wisdom of this vid with the wisdom of squeezing my core, it has been like what, a week? and I already feel the Schwarzenegger coming out.
He is very JACKED!!!!!
Im 47kg My Height Is 1.69Meter  Aged 20 How to Gain Muscle
This man is a goat
I've copied what you've advised went from no of reps to an a 2 b style with lowered weight but quality first I can't believe it unbelievable thankyou it changing my life thankyou 👍👍👍👍
I was at 6’2” 240 lbs eating all kinds of crap every day until my doctor told me my cholesterol is sky high and if I didn’t get it down by my next visit I would have to go on medication for it and probably never come off. I was 42 years old. I decided to cut the crab and took a long hard look at myself in the mirror I was the birth of my new son I knew I had to make some changes I wanted to be there for him when he was older. I’m currently at 195 lbs. I feel better than I ever did before and watching this video has really inspired me to do the next step which is to go back and reevaluate what I’m eating because although I’ve lost tons of fat lower my cholesterol by over 50 freaking points increased my good cholesterol I still don’t have the best abs and I have lost a lot of muscle. I have to say this video really spoke to me and I really appreciate you coming out and saying exactly what people need to hear because it’s the freaking truth. Thank you for making this video I’m gonna go reevaluate my meals. I have been eating those to go packs for oatmeal and I’m gonna be switching that now I drink a lot of crystal light instead of water so I think I’m gonna just make sure to drink more water and then I’m going to eat more of the chicken that I’ve been eating because I have been eating really good prepared chicken no salt in any of my foods. I think I’m gonna rewatch this video every time I start to lose sight. Man I just wanna say thanks, really felt like you spoke about exactly what I’ve been going through.
Thank you, gold advice. Much appreciated! 😊
is it ok if i eat beard ?
Beneficial tips 👍👍
How to measure the percentage of body fat?
We ALL know what "the crap" is.....
First-time watching all this is quite interesting especially when you were talking about the oats and I have a question for you do you think fresh orange 🧃 fresh juice in general it’s good for you or is it doing more harm than good?
GOOD EXPLAINING
Is it safe to eat raw eggs while working out and can they really help you burn fat.
Algo comment.  Step 2 is actually the hardest one for me!
Bro I’m not working out anymore, there too much complicated things to worry about :(
The point he made about also being happy feeling and looking good with your family was the motivation I needed. That shit hit like a Ted talk
Wether it's excess alcohol *stops video* *gives up on 6 pack* *cries*
is ribs and steak okay?
no Alcohol Shhht … I cant Do It Im Recking my Gains
NO PORK!!
Thank you king 💪👑
Fuck. I'm eating chips again
Thanks for this video. Dropping straight knowledge.  I just started seeing my abs recently. Thank for confirming my routine
Repent and turn to Christ
Well i count macros, it didn't work without It. I always used to overeat or undereat.
Most of the dieting channels should be deleted and replaced with this video XD p.s. I love it how the retention graph peaks around F*CK THE MACROS lol
How can i eat regulary If i work shift and different hours Every day?:) is there some tips for us?:)   And one more thing. Why doesnt the stores stop selling crap food?
You’re what I needed. Thank you 💪🏾

God is real and God is love. We are created to love God, trust God, and glorify God no matter what. We can't truly love God unless we trust Him and if you can't find God it's because you are not looking for Him. God knows our hearts and will allow anyone to be deceived who wishes to be. What we call life is just a test an illusion to see who loves God and how much. Anyone who truly loves God will keep God first, keep His 10 commandments, love their neighbors as themselves and do their best not to sin. We all sin and have fallen short of the glory of God. This is why God sent His only begotten son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins so that all those who believe in Him and do their best to live a life that is pleasing to God will not perish but have everlasting life. Heaven and hell exist and the things we say and do in this lifetime will testify for us or against us and determine where we spend eternity. I was born in a Christian home and went looking for The Truth because I could see lies and deception in religion and wanted to know why there are so many different beliefs and religions. God gives us choices but wants us to choose Him. God allowed satan and his demons to test my faith with a demonic attack while He taught me a lesson about patience, holding my peace, and trusting Him no matter what. The Bible is true and this world is a lie. Spiritual warfare is going on right now and demons are fallen angels that work thru all people tempting us to sin and trying to win souls because it hurts God. God has given me spiritual discernment wich is the ability to detect these spirits. God wants me to help wake up the walking dead. The walking dead are people who don't know God are what He expects from us. God wants us to love Him above everyone and everything. He also wants us to love everyone else like we love ourselves, to study His Word, and pray daily. Always remember our enemies are demons not the people they work thru. If we can't forgive others God won't forgive us on judgement day. God is love and love is the fulfillment of Gods law. This world rejects God because it is ruled by satan but God is always in control. God expects everyone who knows the truth to tell everyone who has been deceived. The only way to be saved from our sins is by repenting and excepting God 's only begotten son Jesus Christ because He paid the price for all sin when He died on the cross and rose again. Freedom is free and Jesus is the key. God is love and love is the fufillment of Gods law+++  https://youtu.be/Uge-RG5LHy0  https://youtu.be/0mcFY6OEBOM
If I where Jeff i would never wear a shirt eaither.. ever
HI
Jeff : explaining the point  Me : 😋😛🥱🥴🤬playing with stickers  😂LOL
So how does one do this if you don’t eat carbs or sugar? 🤔 I don’t snack between meals so I don’t spike my insulin
"If you have to question whether it's excess, it's probably excess" 😂 2:10
me just hating sauce persanly t and it has alot of calories is like cut the sauce 🎉 done
so I guess those statues of Greek muscular men from thousands of years ago used supplements and never simply ate clean food
Yeah I’m out, I can’t, I don’t have enough dedication to lose certain foods, and it’s not fast food, it’s like bread, and pasta
I got serious about working out about 6-7 months ago, I definitely got stronger but didn't really start seeing results until I started cutting the hundreds of carbs that I was consuming every day... abs really are made in the kitchen, and sadly you can't outexercise a horrible diet.
Love my chicken ‘ salmon
I’am so glad. Found you’re channel Jeff.  I need a lot help with my eating plus 🏋️‍♀️ out .I’ve been trying for years for my abs. Not looking to good Jeff. I used to be 220.now I’m 167. I usually eat 3 to 4 eggs everyday with oatmeal . Love my oatmeal
Real talk 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I just got a personal trainer. I'm just now starting to eat clean for the first time in my life at 46. 5'9', 183 with 24% body fat. we'll see how it goes!
Yessss... for my "wife" and "kids" 😉
You can work out until you pass out every day. You won't lose weight ,and see change, until you change your nutrition. I'd say it's 70% of the battle. If not more. Jeff is a great source of info, and disciplined. That's the key to look like he does.
Hello Jeff, honest, and straight forward vídeo, no Bull, I follow your videos for a long Time, this is a eye opening vídeo, Thank You, God Bless You, from Portugal.
Ate just Cajun turkey, almonds, and cantaloupe for a month and a half. It started out great but by the end the turkey tasted like cardboard 😂😂
How did I know that link would take to a website selling a bunch of shit instead of an actual diet plan? I must be psychic.
Finally, a guy who knows what he is talking about and is more interested in helping people he does not know and may never even meet than feeding his own ego or making a few bucks at other's expense. Thanks, Jeff!
"F*ck The Macros! "- Jeff Cavaliere
Wow! In this video you toched a lot of things that are exactly me and why I still can not change. If I could, somehow, I would watch this every morning as a motivation...Thank you!
Should I have creatine I’m 13
Wtf!!!! this idiot Did Not mention a single thing about what you should eat to get a six pack. very disappointed
Doing this can teach you a life lesson discipline  something that’s very important even if you an athlete
I’ve started to cut brownies out of my diet so I think that’s a start
“It’s like throwing a deck chair off the titanic.” Haha you are my fucking favorite dude
Jeff...NEVER apologize for the "rant"!! Your delivery ALWAYS feels honest and sincere! Thank you so much for the videos (you too Jesse) r/Tim
I going to subscribe to his program for 2022.
Someone get this poor man a shirt its cold
❤ to the point
Throwing a deck chair off the titanic lmao
Intermittent eating
WOW 😍💪
2021😂😂😂
I was hoping this would be a meal plan....ah, well.
I've come to a lot of the same conclusions myself, but the two things I'm hung up on: coffee and nuts.  Coffee or tea seems it could have some role in "good" nutrition, but it messes with your blood sugar levels ... esp coffee.  And nuts have nice plant-based proteins and some nutrients - but oh so many calories!  What say you?
Good tips bro awesome
I been eating oats every day strictly oats no sugar I add cinnamon and a little milk, I drink a gallon a day it’s dinner and lunch that kill me
thanks Jeff, im already a healthy eater. I eat very little junk, with a mostly Veggy diet, occasional fish. I think I need the supplements and the exercise now. I have been exercising for a couple months now, with results. Thanks only to your youtube channel. is there any supplements you suggest? or ingredients you suggest?
Diet, herbs, exercise and Weight Loss. What are your valuable concerns in this regard?
Ima be honest.I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO CUT OUT.Our foods are processed and have added stuff into it to make it sweet and addictive.Want a normal chicken? WE ALSO PROCESSED THAT AND GAVE IT MORE JUICY ADDITIVES.
Legend :)
Mommy rewarded you with a chocolate sundae 😂
This man helps more then google
Yea he does. I bet he slaps Jesse in the head every day and does it will love. Thanks for the videos
I already do all u said where tf is my 6 pack
We are all guilty of allowing LATER to become NEVER. Long term planning is a sure sign of higher intelligence. A healthy body is literally a heslthy mind....💪💪
Im few months from 17 years old 5'8" ish 122lbs. I have a EXPENSIVE scale that shows me everything, It says 5% body fat 56% muscle mass, 70% water weight and 7.0lbs of bone mass. I DONT eat any sugar, fried food and very rare fast food I am not awkwardly skinny but am not skinny fat, however, dont see any abs. Arms are noticable when i flex, i have been working out for over 1 year now 4 days min. a week consistantly. Any suggestions??
https://youtu.be/NhhxDP-fYUE
Drink water. Stop sugar. Eat low carbs and eat LEAN PROTEIN like boiled eggs and skim milk
Excellent stuff
why?
consistency, commitment and dedication are the keys here and honestly everywhere!
Your face like ashish nehra ( Indian Cricketer ) 😂
Yes store bought juice is full of sugar. That’s why I always juice fresh fruits when I want juice.
Thank you!
Really didn't get much from this as regards to what food we should be eating - is it more protein, less fat, more carbs, less carbs - what?
He made me drink some water while watching this. Thanks for the moti
So question . I have a big booty right not abs I want abs but I don’t want to loose my big booty . So I eat more carbs to keep the booty if I do this will I loose my booty ? I really want a six pack . Will I have to make a decision lol 😂
Really good video, would love to know if his plans help women x
You are doing great work Jeff. I'm far from having a six pack...more like a 2 pack..if the lighting is good. LoL. But thanks for the inspiration.😁
I’m 47 and have a six pack. I have only drank water for 2 years now. Absolutely zero sugar goes into my body. And sugar is in ALL processed food. I practice intermittent fasting everyday. Make sure you soak your steel cut oats overnight. (Warm water/ 1tbls apple cider vinegar) if your prefer some sweetness, add green apple/banana/raisins/cinnamon. No sugar!!! I break my fast everyday with 3 cups of oats. I would say super strict diet is more effective at creating a six pack. Having a strong will power is very important inner muscle to work out. Remember guys, the mental game is just as important as the body game.
He are ding dongs😂😂😂 sorry sorry😬😐…. And this is all I get out of this video🤦🏼
I get bloated really quick so eating frequently is going to cover up my abs 24/7
Sound advice Jeff. Thank you!
Bruh I seen this vid on tiktok and I done the workout for 1 month now. And you can start to see my pack. But I heard somewhere that you don't get 6packs in the gym. You get them in the kitchen. So here I am.
That's why Arnie says 'PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN'
I hope everyone in the comment section  is about to - CUT THE CRAP 💪🏻!! let’s get it 💯
Biggest problem for me is money. Supplements are expensive here. For someone who lives in Iraq, it's expensive to get oats, milk, bananas, and chicken everyday. I do train at home with equipment and I try to eat what I can. Like if I eat with family, I can't force them to cook the chicken a certain way. It can be a struggle.
Plzz make veg diet plan
I love my weight I just really want a six pack 😂
Thanks buddy
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
He is the doctor of fitness
This guy... 🙌👏
Fast food and monsters. Damn he makes me feel bad lol
Here’s some time stamps if anyone needs them 👍   1:03 Step 1: Cut the Crap 2:38 Step 2: Eat more Often 4:22 Step 3  Eat less of the less obvious stuff 7:08 Step 4: Eat more of the good food 8:39 Step 5: Supplement for Consistency
He is awesome 🤩 knows his stuff I want to be trained by him his name is Jeff, just look at him that’s amazing. I know there is ding dong but is there ring ding!
What about zero sugar juices? 🤔
That Christian Bale photo... what the hell?
Okay Jeff, I have a question.  - I went through a low fat phase and dropped 30lbs in 3 months. From what I've read, low (but healthy) fat intake, is the way to shred AND get muscle mass. I've also read that moderate intake of good fats and and lower carb intake will shred the body. If I am going for muscle mass gain, maybe adding 10 or 15 extra lbs, but look shredded, what should my nutrition look like?
Thank you. I'll keep you posted 😅
I actually need personal training from you
Looking back at this 3 years from now i just released that jeff actually motivated me on getting my abs. Still watch you to this day keep up the good work💪🏼
മലയാളീസ് 👋😅
“It’s like throwing a deck chair off the titanic” - one of your best ones yet Jeff 🤣
I just do what John Cena does: If it breathes or if it's green, you eat it.
Practice what you preach.         The proof is preaching what he practices.      Good for you sir !
Ok, here is the truth about six-pack abs.   Almost nobody can maintain them.   It's a temporary state. The reason for this is because all animals in nature, including humans have a body fat percentage set point.  Normally, for young men it's supposed to be between 12-18 percent, and women 15-21 percent, give or take. This is natural and normal.   We all have body fat set points because our body is hard-wired for survival, and our bodies need to know when we are getting too low in body fat so it can put metabolic pressure on you to get back to the set point. To get a good six pack, you usually have to go below 10 percent body fat, which is below the set point.   Bodybuilders do this all of the time before competitions.   They go on calorie counting diets, get down to 5-6 percent body fat for the competition, then gain all the weight back after they perform. This is why I say calorie counting is a great way to lose weight...temporarily. The body just simply does not want to be 5 percent body fat.   Your body will kick in emergency measures to increase your hunger, fat storage metabolism and reduce your energy in a effort to save your life because it senses a famine.    Six pack abs are not sustainable, sorry to say.  It's too low a body fat percentage for your body to maintain.   Just blame evolution and your body's natural instinct to survive for this...
Children should ingest less than 25g of sugar per day, so juice and desserts are even worse for them I guess :(
I need to be sciney
It wasn’t chocolate cake jeff, it was carrot cake that was tempting
Fasting or OMAD for me. Eating often depends on your own body it's not for me.
I cant give up the beer
im eating pizza drinking coke wondering why i dont have a six pack lol
My archenemies butter, bread and cheese did not approve of this video.
U know your back is big when u can see it front the front. Jeeez
I'm  46 years old and I been listening to Jeff advise and I never imagined I could look the way I do at my age .  I have a six-pack now for the first time in my life. I look super lean with a V-SHAPE body but I followed everything he said. And avoid injury's from his coaching. techniques..Jeff I Love you Brother God bless you.
Great.... I am literally from Sri Lanka and yeah it is in a different part of the word. I am pretty sure I am not the one and only Sri Lankan who follows you.  Thanks so much for the tips...
You don’t have a six pack 😂
Can type 2 diabetic with 20% fat achieve 10% fat
Last line was awesome
Sir speak in hindi please
The thing is that you talk much but say nothing
This video was 5 years ago, but still very very helpful until now. 👏
Off topic but question. I’ve been in keto for 2 months solid , broke out of keto for a few days then took me 3-4 days to get back into keto. Then last night I caved and had 2 sausage biscuits, 2 hash browns , and sausage burrito from McDonald’s. I’ve been checking my urine using test strips and noticed I’m still in keto. So how long will it take that McDonald’s splurge to kick me out of keto or did I somehow get lucky and manage to stay in with that much carb intake
i ate worse than you
Hi. This video is so instructional! I have been trying to research for a vid that educates everything in this video! 👨‍⚕️Your tip reminds me of the vids of this informative Dr. Ethan! Doctor's demonstrations are useful and I really learned a lot for finals. He is an insightful med student in the UK and he talks about diabetes!  I suggest you see his channel out and give the health enthusiast a like! ➡️ #DrEthanHealth
Christian Bale hahaha
Great video
i am 12 years old lil girl..and i want abs..and be strong..no more kidnapper😌✌️
My biggest realisation i had getting lean was to dont do any radical changes, becuse its to hard and i quit half way through. Insted i start making small changes one by one, 2.5 years later i dropped 30kg and actually gained alot of muscles as well and best of all i have the six pack and my dream body i always wanted.
"If you have to question whether it's excess, it's probably excess." That's worth a frame.
I wish I could give 10000 likes each for "Cut the crap", and "Fuck the macros".
I wish I could give 10000 likes each for "Cut the crap" and "Fuck the macros".
Where’s the sum up guy?
This guy is good.. thanks for the info, very helpful 🙏 QUESTION!!!! WHATS WITH THE RED DOT ON HIS  Forehead between the eyebrows? Must have some Indian in you brah!
Rant time
Just don’t make excuses. Stop trying to make yourself feel better. Be honest and get rid of the ego. Is what I learned
I have spent months studying the top guide for building 6 packs easily and discovered an awesome website at Toms Magic Shortcut (look it up on google)
he is like the hardcore dad which makes you cry, but one you appreciate and miss after he passed away
I've gone from being a sick 48kg mentally unwell person that had a severe addiction to meth only 6 months ago to 108kg, healthy with a extremely noticeable muscle definition, after #1 going to rehab and #2 really following and studying the suggestions on these videos. Thanks heaps for the great content.
What do I eat more often
Sitting here watching wishing I had a six pack while eating two packets of snacks and a winder hoping my blue berries will even it out 🤣
I really like your videos! thank you very much for that! I am a personal trainer myself and your videos help me a lot! Ihave one question, could you please suggest a good nutrition course that you think that would be good? thanks in advance.
Nice
i love this! no bs! ty
I have a question: Does this include friuts
Is wholewheat bread ok to eat for losing weight?
11:08 : Motivation Level - 99999999.99%
in 3 months with running 2 miles everyday while also lifting weights along with a diet i went from 218 pounds to 183 at 6'5. now i'm trying to figure out how to get those abs to pop and lose that last bit of body fat
Ugh I really want abs I wanna do it I just need to know exactly what I need to do
Is there specific amount you need to eat though? That’s what is really confusing to me..
Can u pls pls reply me... I hav questiona...
1. Cut the crap 2. Eat more often (look at food as fuel) 3. Eat less of the less obvious unhealthy stuff
But what specific food should I eat in meal preps? I do eggs spinach and a little ham in the morning, then I have almonds and a fruit for the second meal, what should I do for the third and fourth meals?
I love how realistic you are
I need the specifics. What ARE the good foods, what IS the good stuff?
"cut the crap" *instructions unclear cut too much crap*
Love your honesty.   Im trying to cut sugar but its been a struggle.
I wonder if jeff can grow a beard.
You really preaching no lies told Im listening
Why don't you say what the "good foods" are?! You just say eat more of the good stuff, well of course that makes sense. What I need to know is what kinds of food to eat..
FUCK THE MACROS!!
I can do regular oatmeal but I really like brown sugar.
Good bye Crap see u in the next life
are we just gonna not talk about how Jeff might just be the best trainer on planet earth?  no?
Great video "Diet Plan for 6 Pack Abs (STEP BY STEP!) could you give your opinion about my article for Diet Program http://www.ronahouse.com/2020/11/what-is-appropriate-diet-program-for.html
Hes just speaking fax and whrn u make these changes ypu'll def look back and be disgusted
The truth about alcohol. 2:10
Thanku
I don’t eat often throughout the day but my appetite is pretty weak, I just try and eat enough nutrition to support my workout
Ok
This is not true
Swole father, Who lifts in heaven, Vascular be thine veins, Thy gains come, Thy sets be done, Overhead as it is on chest. Give us this day our daily macros, And forgive our cheat days,  As we forgive those who curl in the squat rack. Lead us not into half reps, But deliever us from CrossFit. For thine is the Bro, the PR, the natty forever,  Wheymen
I lost 25kg with plan from website *Agoge Diet*. They have amazing team that helped me to get my six pack :D
I would like to have a chat with this guy about exercise and nutrition. 💪🏽 I love when I find other people knowledgeable and experienced on the subject that have good ideas to share.
I just wanna give Jeff a big hug :,)
OMG IM SO RELIEVED he mentioned screwing macros! It’s exhausting counting and counting. Just eat well, good portions, eat regularly, cut the crap 😩❤️
Can’t even imagine this man eating junk! 😩 looks and sounds like he’s known the science of anatomy since birth - and I mean not even in an arrogant way - modestly!
When he said stop drinking juice and soda like a kid I remembered I’m a kid
Good realistic advice that you so much
5:05 Thanks for telling us not to eat Fried chicken, Jeff
Is eating ass consider as crap?
A
5 diet plans 5 million views 5 years ago  who else noticed that😂
Jeff never disappoints.  Who writes his material? Funny and informative.  Good stuff.
Eat clen,tren hard,anavar give up.
It would be awesome if there was an Athlean-X summer bootcamp
Does this mean I have to cook without butter?
"if you have to question wether it's excess, it's probably excess"   Words to live by
warer 😂 6:27
As im eating ice cream
When he said “CUT THE CRAP” that hurt
Vid in conclusion: Eat a ton of the good healthy foods and you’re not a child anymore
I eat fries and rice a lot , Is that the reason I can't get a 6 pack ? I work out 3 times a week  and I weigh around 64 kg
I am a teen girl and i would like to build some muscles, could this diet work for girls too? or do we usually have different diets because of biological reasons? Curious to know!
Saw this on recommended thx YouTube
Jeff acts like the just do it guy from the meme
Don't know how many Athlean vids I've seen, but Holy crap Jeff actually dropped an F 💣! Lol
Shit im in school and we only get one big break to go get something  to eat but problem is that its all crap should i eat nothing or try to eat the healthiest thing i can find(prob won't  be that healthy)
I've been following this channel for months and trying to integrate these key principles in my life. The ones I did, like cutting the crap and seeking the correct form of the exercises, have really done a lot for me. I used to hear "eat big get big" too often, and never have done it. With guidance of Jeff Cavaliere and some others thru yt, I have gotten bigger and better. Everyone around me has noticed this and I am not eating big to get big. Fuck the sugars and dumb fat, start drinking water more often
too much talking !!!
If i eat a large chipotle quasadilla once per week can i still get abs
sir please make a videos with hindi subtitels plz
It's amazing how truths can be said in a lot of different ways to impact people in a specific way. "Looking in the mirror and likeing what you see WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY" but the difference here is that it applies for a lifetime. It's a trade. You either get happy eating what you want and like but NEVER get the body you also want and like; or you quit the junk food that you like and in return (with discipline and CONSISTENCY, as he always says) you get the body you like and want. The question is: which one makes you happier? If you never try, you'll never know. Believe it or not this video was a course changing for many people, myself included.
If I do both Macros and your steps is that good?
I eat and drink quite healthy but I have troubles with cravings. It is when I have these cravings that I start eating too much and sometimes even crap like candy and cookies. The advice on eating small portions during the day is probably my mistake. Thanks for that advice. I will implement it starting tomorrow.
Great video Jeff,
About the eating more part, I showed my sister a picture of a super ripped guy and she said "he must eat one grape a day" and I've never face palmed so hard in my life.
Damn them popeye chicken tenders!!!!
I love this man so much
11:52 LMAO hsaadw.WDq
True words👍👍👍
Could you tell how we can make sure that our kidneys aren’t damaged while we are trying to build a body with the help for a protein rich Diet ? Thanks 🙏
Who the hell has cupcakes for lunch?
Honestly, this guy is better than a lotta youtubers out there.
Me high 🍃 while watching this.....👻
love this guy
What if i drink like only whiskey/brandy  2-3x a week?  But i train 6days a week except on Sundays will it get in the way when i focus on my abs workout?
Awesome tips from 5 years ago. Thank you! As you said, the best reward, the thing you need to be happy, is looking yourself at the mirror, or feeling you have enough energy TRUE!
I found this>>  *Go.Secured.Kim*  100% natural weight loss pill that supports good and natural body function… I can say this is all time best weight loss pill I ever get. No side effect & I’m getting my desire result. Love this.                 samu naka yanzu ASAP
Jeff: 5 simple steps  1: cut the crap  Me: jumped to the comment section and left having no idea for the other 4.
My mom still gives me chocolate sundaes :(
Ten Year Old Me watching this: Hehe.. I'm Gonna Look So Cool.
lol, lists a load of american foods... never heard of any of them but they sound like sex toys - ring dings? :p
I just cant believe this is all for free
What about cheap foods? Peanut butter jelly?
its youtube not able to buy a shirt for this guy?
Hi
This guy's a legend
good advice  ty for sharing
If I do this so that I no longer look "portly", my wife's favorite descriptor of my gut, I will be happy. Trouble is, we always  have food around, including crap, cuz we have beautiful grandkids.
* Talks about cutting the crap and not lying to yourself while standing in front of a fake brick wall. * I'm just kidding! This is a great, no-crap video. I'm a subscriber. Keep making them like this!
I know eating a lot stops you from storing fat but don’t you need to lose the fat before you can eat lots and maintain your six pack?
I can see my body fat decreasing day by day, i eat a slight deficit of calories totaling 2150, 25yo 177cm 66.5 kg. I am skinny fat and i started working out 3 weeks ago. The crazy thing is that i cam see improvements in my muscle, i basically had no pecs, now i can play with flexing them. Due to corona i can't go to the gym but i built my own in my workshop, i workout every other day and if i feel really sore i take another day off. Steady cardio in the form of swimming with friends 2-3 times a week. I find it kinda hard to structure my workout, but i made a journal and follow previous workouts.  I feel a lot better about myself since i started this. Thank you sir.
Too bad my depression is effecting my appetite
he is right
wow good abbs bro
Jokes on you I took a dump and used my sharpest pair of scissors to cut it and I’m still fat
No cheat days got it , but I didn’t know creatine is in steak? People used to say in middle school, I was just creatine all water , and I used to be like that’s retarded fuck you mother fuckers they gave me a bad opinion of creatine now you’re telling me I need it in my diet . I did not know it was in steak and you can’t eat steak a lot or you get heart disease
Wasted rn so excuse the potential spelling mistakes but this guy literally makes me excited for the next gym days. I can't stress how much you have helped me. I am literally watching your videos as I fall asleep after a night out. i love you
Cut the crap... ight bro I’ma go ahead and head out
Ring Dings
6.08 i thought when he said "same thing with juice" he ment jews xdxd
i am 13 and i am willing to make this change
"Get rid of that crap, you know what it is."       Black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow
F#*k the macros 😂😂🔥✊🏾
I'm 5'6 and I was 190 pounds a month ago. I'm now 179 pounds because of your guidance. 11 pounds in 1 month. At the end of the day it's up to the individual to change. I appreciate everything you do and I will always support your work.
Last 6 months i stayed away from sugar as much as i could(half tblspoon in coffee)except fruits, eating 2 eggs in the morning, working out every day like lifting weights, eating as much as protein, and still don't have a single abs to show, still have some love handles...
he has never had a hostess cupcake. he just said that to make me feel better 🤣
He is absolutely right about diet. I am down to 10 percent body fat now and I can tell you (being natural) I can’t even have a cheat meal once a week anymore. If I truly want to keep shredding I’m gonna need to have a desert once a month basically lol. Props to Jeff as I think he is natural. And it’s tough!!
"Deck chair off the Titanic?!"😂 Never heard that one. I've only heard "putting lipstick on a pig," "poopy-flavored lollipop," "big screen with no cable (old school)," "Ferrari with no engine," "big tits on a fat chick."...Well, I guess I've heard a few. Anymore, youtube family?
Best vid ever
Your videos are really fantastic!
Eating less frequently is better. Your blood sugar levels become normal, and you're body enters Ketosis, and later autophagy.
Steak is a superfood. It is outdated information that it is bad for the heart. Refined carbs and processed oils are terrible for the body. Grass fed or pastured steak is incredibly nourishing and can be eaten every day. I know this is an old video so just sharing what I’ve been taught. Don’t be afraid of red meat! 🥩
These are damn good videos. Tons of respect my dude! Please keep it up!
When you "cut the crap", how did you deal with cravings?
His biceps is touching his chest 😮 dammmnnnn
My sippy cup has flavored seltzer water in it..😂🤪
Thanks Jeff. The way I like it no BS! talk. Respect that. Thank you as always.
All this depends on metabolism and how often you work out.
Ive lost 60 pounds, but now i wanna define my body so here i am.
Is this still effective in 2020? Our body might updated
watching this drinking a pepsi
legit, step 1 made me cack myself laughing. we love you so much mate.
There’s no way this guy isn’t flex his abs or pulling in his stomach. if there’s anyone that sees this that has a six pack: do you guys flex your abs or pull in your fat or is it just straight abs
Great video!!! Thank you :)
Your body is beast mode bro. Congrats! Thanks for helping the rest of us........also......fkn tacobell commercial before a 6 pack video. That's temptation lol.
Then there are guys like me. Who has far from a perfect diet. Who has a 8 pack more or less since age 13 no matter what. Stopped lifting a while back, still have an 8 pack. Diet is okay at best, thats pushing it. Just blessed with low bodyfat and have a very easy time to drop weight.
Thanks for your information
“&#@%” the macros guys.
This man is trying to help change lives and people are just making fun of him , I mean like why ,he is just helping!!! Trust me You should never view the comments section
This man is giving a lot of real information for free !  That’s great karma for him !  Blessings bro
When Ross starts working out..💪
If I stand in the bathroom 45 degrees to the door close the door acute angle (small ,for stupid folk)of say 37.67895643289 degrees (roughly)get somebody to switch the bathroom light on or off 60 bpm (this is essential) I can actually see something developing ,yaay
Man Jeff’s physique has only improved over the last four years
The comments are more interesting than his talking, 😂
Ok So I am going to try the plan
I’m eating ice cream anyone else
only dumb people disliked this video
2015: Jesse's first job as intern erasing & writing the whiteboard below the camera.  Way to go J!
I work on my abs every day and still I see no results. The thing is that I don't know what I am doing wrong or what I am eating that is wrong
How do you feel about lemon water (even from concentrate)? I'm cutting out fruit juice but I get bored of ONLY water and tea (black). I have concentrated lemon juice with no added sugar, etc., but I'm wondering if that is still just acting as a "replacement."
wow this is when Jeff didn't have his god-like appearance
Fuck with this dude man he really help ‼️💯
Please stop eating chickens Jeff. Stop eating death(corpses of animals). Start eating living nutrients (plants).
Go vegan asap, I got a 8 pack and extremely low body fat and now im shredded
Can I still have butter?????????
How accurate are the health star ratings? Because I’ve been trying to just stay above 3/3.5
Bro you haven’t told us what to eat. I want my view back 😤😤
By the time I finished this video I had an 8 pack and a contract with CK for a permanent role as male model  But in all seriousness, thanks for the advice. Gonna stack it with your other nutrition videos and fix my body
This right there is just all you have to do but lets be honest, 95% of people wont keep on this diet for long. What you saying right there is meant for pro body builders and 95%+ people here are just normal folks. In fact, when a normal folk thinks he/she gotta do all this just to have 6packs abs, he/she just give it all up instantly and sometimes even quit working out. You CAN eat whatever you want but do this knowing its not that good for your body, but do it, eat whatever you want. We are humans, not robots , we have desires. If you wanna compete at mr Olympia, follow this dude. If you wanna be a normal human with sicks packs still being able to do some of what you desire, discipline yourself.
Oh its Oatmeal, sounded like Opium. Lol.
What is macros?
As he brought up the first point "cut the crap" I'm laying on my bed with a bar of chocolate... Great start
11:09 this last point is just facts
Im going to do this for 60 days and the train right
He looks like a ripped Ross from friends😂💀
In one of his videos he says he been clean eating for 30years i can smell a bit of bullshit. Still respect him for his knowledge tho
Chicken is the worst protein out there.  Full of synthetic antibiotics that kill your good bacteria.  Boot it completely.
I recommend poverty as best diet
Wow you went from pure sugar to healthy muscle man
F$@# MACROS!
What about homemade juice?
Where's the Timestamp guy
ok my new diet is gonna consist of oatmeal, granola bars  chicken breasts, rice, turkey slices  and lots of water and milk     lmk what i should add or scratch
Anyone have any brand recommendations on slow cooked oats?
If u grow a beard ull look more awesome
I keep trying to convince myself that I don't need to eat more often, but Jeff has finally worn me down! Setting my timer to make sure I eat every 3 hours minimum
This is exactly what we all needed to hear. Thank you for making this video.
Thanks, dude! It is finally sinking in.
I'm really good at following diets until I roll my joint at 11Pm.. then all hell breaks loose.
Really distracting.  Just can't concentrate on what he is saying.  Just watching that crooked mouth and nose.  I wonder if that nose gets in the way of eating.  Ya call it the nose obstructive diet plan!
Look at his face, those ears and shape of the head.  He had to get something right about the way he looks.  Date night should be a bag over his head and his little brothers t-shirt.
sir its amazing to c ur videos n very inspiring n motivating at the same time...but can u plz prepare a diet or meal chart for all of us here...like meal 1 meal 2 etc etc...it will be so helpful.lukn forward to u sir.
Yo, when he said “you can find happiness in front of the mirror instead of the chocolate cake” I felt that.
I heard some guy lost 12kg in just one month by following diet plan from *Next Level Diet*, so I tried that too. Although I didn't lose that much, I could say this thing really works and it's definitely worth trying
I've heard this so many times, BUT, it is so much more MEANINGFUL and INSPIRATIONAL coming from someone who PRACTICES exactly what they preach and CAN actually do it! I also LOVE how he approaches this from a LIFE STYLE change and how to look good for your ENTIRE LIFE ... or what's left of it. When they bury me, I want to be buried shirtless so they can see my 6 pack abs (ok, not totally shirtless since I'm a female - but you get the point - wouldn't want to gross anyone out LOL).
Respected sir please convert video in hindi
this guy is awesome
"F*ck your macros!" Jeff the Tough-Ass...that's the next shirt
Macros,macros,macros 🤮
Get muscles like me, I got 7kg of lean muscle mass in two months only. I visited website called NextLevelDiet, they provided me with 30 days diet meal plan and training plan. Their tips helped me to gain muscles as well.
Gold advice as always!! Something which has also helped me is becoming pescatarian.
Mate all i had to do was eat and now i have a 6 flab, healthy diet who?
Fuck the macros! lol
I love it when he rants 😁🤛
I love my fizzy juice!! I can’t believe he asking me to give it up 😩
This video is 4 yrs old, I wish I started watching and working out with his first video... Lol
I'm 15 is removing crap still a big issue out of the five steps? Or should I focus on other things.
Can any1 please share the summary of what he want to say? I mean main pointers.
Can you eat them like at least once a week?
I mean.....he's abs are not that visible
Summer bodies are made in winter. I am making mine, what about you? You can create training and meal plan yourself, or you can save your time and visit *Next Level Diet*. You chose
Fu k the macros🤣🤣🤣🤣
People always suggest intermittent fasting...I dunno if this works long term but when I tried it I would always look bloated as hell after eating but it was probably because I was over indulging.
I have abs but cuz of corona there going a way and I haven’t been playing basketball to maintain my body I started eating worse on this corona vacation smh
Loving your training videos. Thank you Jeff.
You know what it is!🤣
Whats macros
I actually eating a chocolate cake then when he said chocolate cake damn I feel so guilty I start working out lol
If you ask me, it's really hard to gain muscle and lose weight at the same time, but website called NextLevelDiet is great for that. They also calculate your BMI and calorie intake for FREE and provide you with diet meal plan and training plan.
What about tea?
awesome  words
I only drink water and eat healthier and lost almost 30lbs
Did he say donuts?
I cut all crap out and started a fairly healthy diet without been boring. -meal 1 Yellow fish  -meal 2 chicken breast  -meal 3 chicken breast  -meal 4 chicken breast -meal 5 small healthy tea  -meal 6 omelette  Before starting the day i have 1 large scoop of MDMA to help with pre workout and burn fat. I have heroin before bed because it helps with the sleep..like I said it's fairly healthy.
Bro hw about peanut butter,  can we take as diet in order to make six packs
Totally agree...
Nice one!!!!
ding dongs, ring dings haha
Step 6: Start today, don't make the mistake to say: "Oh yeah nice idea, i'll do it tomorrow. Because then you will always say tomorrow. Say Today.
Fuck the Macro's!!!!
Why the hell would you show us that picture of Christian Bale? That's nightmare fuel, man!
On the subject of the difference between chicken and fried chicken, I was VERY upset when KFC discontinued their grilled chicken.
"Forget about my supplements". The most honest fitness master
I dont eat junk food, i dont drink, i eat  right, i drink enough water, i dont drik or eat sugar, i only eat clean carbs, i even look after how much fruit i eat (cause of fructose), i workout and i dont have hormonal problems. So i really dont get why im stucked in 14% fat
great video
4:43 sounds like he says I started eating opium more often lol
YOU ARE AMAZING 🤩 Thank you 😊 I needed this message!!
You talk to much
I dont kny but for some reason my belly is really big I look like am pregnant..I dont know what I will to have abs.and the rest of my body have nice shape but only my belly is the problem..I will start to eat just salad for a month let's se the different.and abs 3 times  a day.  What do you think would be good idea?
Yo I really struggle with leaving beer, my diet is on point during the week, but on the weekend I usually have 4,5,6 beers with the boys. 😪😪
Thanks for this video Jeff. Great advice as always💪
This is fantastic. Bravo.
Just what I needed to hear. Thanks Coach 💪🏿
F the Macros 👏😂🇹🇹 love this guy and the work he does
This isnt a diet plan, he's just telling us to eat better damn it
Do you have any pictures of yourself in the days when you didn't eat healthy?  I would love to see that.  It would motivate everyone to see how you looked before.  Also how hard was it for you to cut the crap?  Thanks for another great video.
I couldn't tell if you said that we SHOULD forget about the end goal or SHOULD NOT forget the end goal. Do I focus on the abs I want or something else?
What if you have a fast metabolism and have to take medicine which one of its negatives is loss of appetite and weight loss
Is it healthy for someone as young as 15 to take supplements? Also they are expensive so I can’t necessarily get them.
I signed the 30 day challenge but idont know the diet if it really works plz. Suggest me little one My gut is little over with size
1. Cut the crap 2. Eat more often 3. Review your diet again 4. Eat the good stuff lots of water 5. Supplement and discipline 6. Motivation is key: rewards are getting in shape, feel good about yourself, respect from others, etc.
2 chicken breasts 26g protein each, 1.5g fat each.  Protein shake 2 scoops ~60g protein 3g fat total  Ab circuits exercise, lots of water, creatine
I eat 3000 calories of good food a day (chicken, salad, pasta, rice, etc) and I'm still underweight.
Real talk right there! There’s no short cuts. You need to do the work and eat the right food! Cheat day is only cheating yourself!
Yes man jeff you are 💪👍
*The only thing i eat is the god dam rice*
Jeff: cut the crap. cut your diet  Asian: *eeu tink dat low oaf mi?*
This kind of plan is best suited to those who are already/still fairly insulin sensitive; less insulin sensitive individuals are better off cutting back the carbs at least until metabolic health is restored.
My diet consists of: -Peanut Butter -Whole Grain Bread -Milk -Water -Kashi Go Crunch Cereal -Fruit (mostly banana) -Protein bar -Over Hard Eggs -Scrammbled Eggs (no butter, just eggs) -Omelette (no butter, just eggs) -Black Beans -Turkey/Chicken Breast (from deli) -Potatoes  Fast Food -Subway 9 Grain Wheat Footlong -Rotisserie Style Chicken -Lettuce -Tomato -Sweet Onion Sauce  -Chipotle -Brown Rice -Pinto Beans -Steak -Tomato Salsa  Is that a good diet, what can i improve?
I'm a 16 year old girl and live in a Hispanic household. My mother cooks with a bunch of cheese, oil and butter. A lot of sweets coming in the house also ordering  a bunch of take out. I want to get abs because I want to have it. I have cut out eating junk food but they would just constantly  make me feel horrible  and say im starving myself. I legit was done doing a core workout  and yoga then while I was done they brought whataburger home. Help what should  I do.
Thanks for another great video Jeff. What might you amend to step 2 regarding older people (55+) since our metabolism is slower? I do well at sensing what might body needs and how much. But I'm wondering how your recommendations relate to or need to be adapted to us older people? God bless.
what if you are vegetarian?
Do you know what?? You talked, talked talked and then talked some more... But in the end you said nothing... Like all those macro videos you are so angry with... And obviously you end up selling your miraculous program... Wich works i have no doubt like so many others work... Bottom line is... Do you want to see your abs??? Caloric deficit plus ab workout....
I know I drink excessively.  It is what I struggle with most.  I plateau because I feel like there is never a look I will achieve that will be good enough to attract someone else, even though I love exercise and martial arts.  I am really meditating on why I am so deep in my own darkness, and I appreciate honest coaches like this who tell it like it is.
what about skinny teens? teens can't really do diets cause they're growing and stuff like that.
speaking facts jeff
Its still shock me just how a lot of people do not know about Custokebon Secrets (just search it on google) despite the fact that lots of people lost lots of weight using it. Thanks to my buddy who told me about it. I've lost a ton of fat.
Ahah ring dings ding dongs wtf these some funny sounding foods
If you ask me, it's really hard to gain muscle and lose weight at the same time, but website called NextLevelDiet is great for that. They also calculate your BMI and calorie intake for FREE and provide you with diet meal plan and training plan.
I am staring to get obsessed by this channel because everything he says works for me. Godspeed brother.
Thanks
Is drinking milk bad for abs or diet?
I GOT 2KG OF LEAN MUSCLE MASS IN ONE MONTH!!! I simply visited website called NextLevelDiet and they provided me with diet plan, training plan along with amazing fitness and nutrition tips. Believe me, it's just amazing!!!
I've cut out bread, sugar in my tea and cut down on the chocolate. I've also started eating more protein. Eggs and red meat. The results are getting there. Lost three inches around my belly in four months. Eight months to go before Abbmageddon!! Big arms, big chest, flat stomach means more birds!! Good luck. xx
The raw truth! Its the only way to deliver the truth
I wish after a minute he’d put a shirt on
I just realised If he isn’t so buff  His LONG neck would show
I love your attitude...I’m a new subscriber and I love your no BS tell it like it is with science to back it up keep the videos coming!!
I love you Jeff, you’ve honestly changed my life. Thank you for all you do
Thank you Jeff. You are amazing.
4.6million views... I wonder how many of them have six packs 😅
Just give me a straightforward answer for once holy fuck
Jeff and Christian Bale in the same video: best video of time
But why Jeff kinda look like Christian Bale
You are such a tool
I want to change myself but i can't  I am loser
Guys can eating excess healthy food slow down the process of gaining abs. I’m worried that eating too much can prevent me from getting abs.
I get headaches when I take creatine is that normal?
anybody ever had luck with carb cycling? im doing it rn and it sucks
Why am I watching this? I have abs 😂
The way he complimented water made me smile. Got no idea why.
Awesome, real truth, thank you!
YouTube recommended me this........ I think it is trying to teach me a lesson
It's still surprise me just how many people have no idea about Custokebon Secrets despite the fact that a lot of people  using it. Thanks to my pal who told me about this. I have lost tons of weight.
Did you know sugar is apparently way more addictive than cocaine
People say it's fine to eat junk when your young but I'm 15 am I wasting being able to eat junk by not eating it
Every word he said is true!!!
Cool , no juice at all! 😘
I know this vid is from 2015, but is eating often still better than IF? All the marvel Celebs, latest of which was Kumail Nanjiani did IF get 6 pack abs. Please advise.
Bahaha “whether it’s excess alcohol...*rolls eyes* it’s probably excess”
Hey guys i also have 2 videos on how to get a 6 pack. I found it quite effective in my fitness journey and feel it can be applicable to anyone who wants to get them. Check these out @natethegreat 🔥that’s my channel
Umm well I watched this whole video & still don’t know what specific foods I should eat & what I shouldn’t eat
my journey is going to be hard as I am a very bad eater tho I almost like no vegetables and it annoys me! well I stopped eating candies and potato chips completely but that's seemingly not even close enough :/
What about Pepsi max
as much as Iove Jeff I think he is describing a  "Bulking diet" instead of a "Cuttting diet.
I grabbed an apple and some Oreos! Trying to compromise with my fat self!
,, n-m-n’s😂😂😂😂
I almost cried. Very motivating. I really needed that !
I know my biggest problem is carbs...I eat too many carbs. I need to actually start implementing Jeffs 9 o clock and 9:20 guidelines
Damn peanut butter, taste so good.
You're an absolute legend mate, God bless you
Ok I was with you till you brought up the creatine crap
I was looking for an abs routine, instead i got scolded.   No regrets it's kinda motivating tho
I have to cut down on 🍺 🤨
Wish I could meal prep like I need to to eat more throughout the day😔 military life is rough
I was debating if I wanted the 6pack or the   12pack.
hi everyone ,if anyone else wants to uncover abdomen exercises try Mighty Shortcut Folio (should be on google have a look ) ? Ive heard some pretty good things about it and my friend got excellent success with it.
But what is good food? If I where to eat smaller meals every 2-3 hours. What should I eat?? Examples
Hahaha "FUCK THE MACROS!"
I am an indan and i dont know what to eat. Here rice is 2 times a day with dal currys and fried fish.sometime once 2 weeks chicken with rice.. Break fast and dinner is chapathi . dosha. Which is either wheat or rice thing..what shoud be an indian diet plan for six pack? Please help.
I can't give up my Gardettos and red wine!
This guy is so authentic, I love it.
Very tough to eat right/ avoid bad stuff.  Similar to Dave Ramsey financial stuff,  Eat like no one else now so you can look like no one else.   At the office and ads on TV, there are so many bad food and drink temptations.
Did you mean I still get abs even if I eat a lot of rice everyday. No man you're joking aren't u?
Good video . Much kudos no bullshit .
No sugar, low carb, high fat, mod protein.   Eating more often triggers insulin and therefore fat is NOT BURNED.    Intermittent Fasting + KETO is the real answer to shedding body fat and getting a six pack.     A person sitting watching TV is burning more fat while in Ketosys than someone on a treadmill after a meal.    Weight loss in hormonal. Eating often?  - A swing and a miss.    Used to believe that myself.    Now AARP and dropped 80 lbs in two years - mostly due to NOT eating often.    See Dr Chung, Dr Berg channels.
One thing I love about Jeff is he is always speaking the truth, keep on keeping on man, you do so much for so many people. You have inspired me to get my self into shape and not over complicate something that can be simple as far as what I eat. Your awesome man.
What about fasting ?!
These are good tips for general american diet.  In most parts of the world people don't really eat fried jammed stuff or drink sugar pumped sodas.
I got my abs by starving myself 😅
Eating more Bacon, doughnuts & chocolate cakes will get you SIXPACK
Some pussies needed to hear “F your macros!”   All calories are not created equal.   250cals of cupcakes isn’t the same as 250cals of avocado.
Your the Gordan Ramsey of working out...
Can i have another...thank you sinsay
Great video!
"Excess alcohol". To me there is no such thing haha.
I just jumped back onto ketosis to get my abs back. I lost 27lbs in 6 weeks mid last year and felt amazing
What do you think about Kombucha
AWWWWW    Group hug Jeff.  We love you
This video is definitely fantastic! It helps me remember of the time when my wife used Custokebon Secrets to get rid of 16 pounds and enjoy being healthy again! Most of us wish to lose fat, however we also require to stay nutritious, and that's what Custokebon Secrets gifted.
This is the vid that will make me a consistent viewer. The dick root is disturbing though.
This depends on your body type. I eat whatever I want and I got my 6-pack from only doing sit ups. Everyone is different.
Why eat more often? What about those who do Intermittent fasting, or on Keto/low carb?  Some of those guys have 6 packs.
What if I eat healthy and follow your routines but still nothing happens ?
Jeff is the best in the country. Great motivational speaker and great coach. Wouldn't recommend anyone else besides this guy. I havent even met him and i feel like i have just by his videos 😭
Christian Bale is a hell of an actor
is butter bad?
Ol tough ass over here 😂
Legs
Jeff always delivering.
Literally got stuck on the"excess alcohol" comment and never heard  the rest of it.
I’d rather have the Homer Simpson look!
Step 1  steroids
How do you feel about the science backing intermittent fasting?
Fuck Macros
Is eating ass a good replacement for the all the greasy fried chicken tenders i’ve been eating?
Jeff I have a question for you, I’m a pretty big fan, god knows how many videos I have watched since I started watching your videos a little over 5 years ago, what is your opinion regarding fasting?
So are Quaker’s oats bad?
1:03  I'm Dead 🤣🤣🤣
I said damn it at step 1
wait, what does he eat in place of oatmeal?
11:17 say something form teens who dont have families.....
Don't wank
Physique = LifeStyle = Nutrition
This man is freaking jacked
I'm only a kid, but ill manage
This guy is great! Simple strategy!
Also, the idea i have is that cheat days activate mTOR
Jeff, I’m trying to get there, but others are saying that eating spikes insulin, so instead of 6 small meals, we should aim for two to one meal per day. That said, my BMI and bodyfat% is high enough that I could miss a few meals. Which is better?  6/day or OMAD?
will creatine help in bodyweight training?
Thanks man. I workout everyday and I do feel stronger but I still look fat. I need too get my food in too shape first it's hard. My workouts is consistent but my eating needs too change fast
3:56-4:02 who else didn't understand

Great video man!! Love the no bs advice.
When I’m trying to cut. Why is it so hard to eat the food. 6’1 250lbs but it’s so hard for me to get the right nutrients for my weight because you have to eat a lot of lean food to reach your macros. And I get full quickly so when I try to finish my food I almost get sick and start to gag sometimes. Where am I going wrong?
Six pack coming soon ......
Youtube literally put a dunkin doughnut ad in this video😂😂😂
You don't have abs yet , so shut up
Jeff, do you have a picture of yourself when you used to eat donuts for breakfast?
Initially you were useful .. now you are not more than a guru giving insane gyan without any proper information.. all bullshit ... i was looking for a chart of diet and i didnt get that ... unsubscribing you ...
I eat lots of eggs that's where i get my protein
Fuck the macros that’s what I’ve been saying
Brother a suggestion. Plz do shorter video. Keep it under 3 minutes try it and see the views
Wow I wish you were my personal trainer, very clever indeed!
Can you do a video on the healthiest way to cook chicken and other common "healthy" foods?
Shirtless Jeff is easy on the eye.
Jeff thanks for your hard work and your Videos, cannot get your supplements in the 🇬🇧 are optimum nutrition and SIS good alternatives and if so what do you recommend? Hope you are well, Kevin
Jeff is currently one of our leaders over here in America.
Why won't we get a ab machine that will probably help
Get a air cooker that will help with chicken or just bake your chicken
2 pack guy telling us how to have 6 pack lol
Can
I can't eat healthy I eat school food
Why is the left pec messed up in the thumbnail
Hey im 12 and i train 5-6 times a week and This all dieting things a bit hard for me
#cutthecrap.. love it❤️.
Stop using those naughty words you little rascal. My abs are bigger than yours LOL
You can tell he ate a lot of Dunkin Donuts from the way he sounds
Do you even lift bro
ahahaah he looks like David Schwimmer
You're making me hungry, Donuts yum yum
That F bomb gave me a six pack :O
10:47 This is the most important part. If you remember anything from the video, remember this.
im nine i like water more than soda
I am a girl
Um you can get abs using workouts and a calorie defect , I have them and can eat what ever I want
Jeffs macro person impersonation was funny assf
This guy really knows his shit
100,000 of the views are 13 -15 year old wanting to impress their crush.
I’m skinny eating chips and want abs ... welp I guess it’s time to take this seriously
Talking too much , cut the crap cut the crap.   at least bloody tell what type of food is crap.
who's watching this while eating pizza?

You always say that if it’s not something you like, it won’t last full term. I think the key here regarding nutrition is to change what you like. Obviously people are fat and overweight because they are eating the foods they like... the challenge is to get people who want to be healthier and look better to eating foods that are healthier, foods they may not like in the beginning but may grow to like...  it all boils down to this, if we want to be healthier and look better, it’s not really about eating what we like or what we want. We must change our cravings for bad foods (greasy, sugary, processed foods)...   I’ve been struggling with this idea you mentioned and have come to the conclusion above: I can’t eat the foods I enjoy if I want to lose weight and be healthier. I love carrot cake, pizza, chocolate... but eating those foods throw me off. What should I do?  P.S I appreciate you talking about nutrition because that’s a rarity with fitness channels. I’ve subscribed to you.
I didn’t understand the last step
Jeff it's too bad you havd to see all these stupid comments all the time. Love the detailed science based info and techniques. You obviously have a passion for this and it shows in every video. You're proof is in your appearance. So glad I have foung your videos and have benefitted greatly. Thank you and keep being a Rockstar!
I had to put up subtitles because I missheard oatmeal for opium...
What kind of oatmeal??
Fuck macros!😂😂😂
Thrush .....from sugary diet and antibiotics got me here and I’m 3 weeks in and I keep changing and improving. Loved this vid!
So, no being a fatass one week out of the year on vacation?
I’ve made a total change for the better thanks to Jeff. Gains, athleticism and the drive is insane. Keep inspiring people.
Jeff I have an extremely shredded physique, but I think I might have an eating disorder. I’m 14 years old 61 inches tall and I weigh 106 lbs. I am a wrestler so I burn a lot of calories a day( I train 2 times a day). However, my obsession on how my food is cooked and the weight of my food has negatively impacted my family and social life. I struggle to eat enough healthy carbs because I only allow myself to eat protein and veggies when I can’t cook.This has caused a lack of recovery and energy in the gym. Please tell me what you would do In my situation?
I can watch this video1000 times!
You had me until you threatened my sippy cup
Hey Jeff, how do you feel about the idea that you shouldn’t eat breakfast because your body is still burning off food from the night before?
Fuck macros, Jeff is the realest
What’s the obsession with abs? Shoulders, chest, biceps and ass are far more important to women.
yeah im that dad that follows my daughter through the tubes and one of the even fewer that can fit!
Problem with most store bought juice, it usually has more sugar than a pop.
He looks like Leonel messi
How does meal frequency correlate with fat loss or any health benefits
What if you have something like just one puddin cup a month? That's just a example.
He forgot step #6, facepulls.
do you know what is as healthy as water and even more delicious??     AYRAN!
So it's really boils down to nutrition
Literally The Best Fitness Coach In The World and Literally The Best ❤
I love this channel. Lots of great infor. Thanks
Best man ever
how bad is diet coke?
I’m waiting for him to make a video of (why giving birth through vagina is wrong) 😁 for women only
I’m glad you added some seasoning to those egg whites👍🏼I would’ve added a tablespoon of xtra sharp cheddar
Is crank considered a good pre-workout or fat burner😂good ole biker crank!
The REALIST!!!   Thanks Jeff!!!!
"If you have to question whether it's excess alcohol, it's probably excess." True for many other things too!
i mean i got abs but they show a but me and my brother have a good nutrition but i want them to show our v cuts and love your vids athlean x 💪
I really need to know that, what happens when you do cardio every day except weekends and do abs like 2 times a day. (i tried searching on google). Will it help lose belly fat? thanks
Am I the only one who gets extremely bored listening to Jeff?
Yo what if you have diabetes type one and you need to use juice to increase your blood sugar
The crappiest thing I eat is milk.
Sorry bro! Your abs are not that great for me to follow your advices. I want real 6 packs abs. You don’t look the part! You need more definition in your abs.
what about Crystal light......
this guy is like a young rocky
Can women do this too.
now that he said it, I noticed that his body has improved a lot over the years.
My lunch is air
fucks you
Sometimes, my mommy still gives me a chocolate sunday. 🤗
eating more frequently hmmm. Thats ancient advice . This video is from 2015 , i hope Jeff has changed his advice now . (Insulin  resistance)
Jeff is the god father of fitness, he tells the truth and does not sell bull
First time I ever heard of the Titanic deck chair as an analogy. Well played good sir
Jeff shirtபோடுப்பா சும்மா ஒடம்பக் காட்டாத...
I have to drink my coffee, too.
I live on a farm where we raise half or most of our food and we make apple cider with no add sugar or anything just found apples, is that ok.
Awesome videos! Thank you for posting these!
I did that years ago.  I am a fifty three year old woman who inspire of eating good and working out has gained thirty pounds.  I no longer see my abs.  Most over your advice works for guys and younger women, but women like me are struggling to get this shit off our bodies.  What is your advice for us?
6:40 Hitler be like:
As a glutenfree vegan I really have a hard time implementing those recomandations, its hard to know what to eat.
I'm keeping my cheat day I don't give a hoot
Thank you Jeff
😂😂fuck da macros😂😂
So cut the crap ok, what the fuck do I eat, what kind of food and how much of it?I m not sarcastic.
Excellent advice as usual
No mercy. Ugh. I eat too much sugar, I know. Environment is so important too for support ! Great video! Maybe I’ll try harder this time ~
11:53 fuck the macros lmao
I thought you too intermittent fast like 18 hours a day
Watching this while eating pizza rolls rn🤦🏾‍♂️
Fk Macros. Lol.
Quiero un ejercicio abdomen medio  lo otro no me sirve si me funciona tu video abdominales bajo  y vientre
If you don't know what it is? if you don't I'd shock😁 we know but must of us are in denial😕
When to take your protein? Should the real question be how fast can your body absorb protein ? If you are taking more then your body can absorb per hour isn’t it literally going down the toilet ? Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us sir  I am 61 years old and after following your work out advise I almost have that six pack. Again, thank you.
"We want to stabalize our blood sugar by eating frequently"  Get your facts straight Jeff
Don´t eat chickens or any other animals - it´s unhealthy and will make you sick in the long run. Eat tofu or tempeh instead. You don´t have to drink a ton of water - you can eat your water by consuming a lot of fruit. Fruit is superior human food.
Do protein bars count as crap ???
Didn't he look like Mike Hussey ???
I eat so much crap but I still have a ripped six pack and i barely work on my abs  How is this possible? l
Love the rants. Super motivating and great info.
I eat alot but ig I've been eating the good food den the bad
https://www.nirogdarpan.in/diet-fitness/want-flat-abs-your-protein-supplements-guide/
Chemically  engineered supplements  are toxic and cancerous to the human body. Period.
Meh. IMO this is good advice for beginners and people who burn a lot of calories working out every day... but tracking your calories/macros is crucial if you want to get in great shape with a less active lifestyle. For the average Joe with a deskjob who just wants to hit the gym a few times a week and get jacked, tracking your calories and macros is everything.   If an athlete needs 150 grams of protein to nourish their muscles and eats 4000 calories/day at maintenance, you don’t even have to think about protein because you’ll naturally get enough just by eating a healthy variety of clean food.   If you’re an average Joe, you can still get those 150 grams if protein, but you’ll need to track your macros/calories if eating over 2,400 calories/day makes you fat.  Also, athletes can just realize they’re getting fat and cut back on their junkier food when they want to lose weight. They have such a huge window between the macros they need and the calories that they burn/day that they can get away with an intuitive approach. The average guy doesn’t have such a big window, so when they start cutting back on calories, it’s more important to be calculated because it’s easy to dip too low and start sapping away your muscle.  Personally, just eating healthy and working out got me in year round decent shape. When I started dialing in my diet, it was a game changer.
What about TV diners
Awesome job Jeff thank you
hey there, i have a question and it might be a "stupid" one: i know French fries are actually a food of the "crap" category, but i wanted to know, if you'd call it "more of the less obvious" if its made by a fat-free-fryer or could one say "nah, it's okay"?   thanx
2015 Jeff clearly doesn't know that eating often spikes insulin and slows fat loss for the vast majority of people. #IntermittentFasting
Everyone has cheats  days    Lol
Anyone else notice how much he sounds like David Schwimmer?
Thanks for the honesty, but if dont count your macros aren't you prone to overeating ?
My cheat meal is chipotle 👌
I'm eating a donut watching this video
Weetabix just dropped high protein weetbix, those are good I guess
The Channel that’s our real friend. Not a buddy! Thanks for your videos!
wow I needed to hear this so bad bro💪💪💪💪💪
Jeff, thanks for the tips!
8:15 also takes a little while for your gut flora to get used to a new diet, so they're not as effective in helping you digest and absorb for a few days, and they won't be giving you the happy biochemical signals until they've adapted.
Watching this made me hungry...
Is it just me or did he just say a lot of nothing.
*Hostess.exe has stopped working*
Where my 2019 people
Fxxk the macros!!!😂😂
F*** the MACROS F*** em
Excess alcohol...if you have to question if its excess, its excess. 😂
Try going pescatarian guys, ive gotten down to 9% body fat going vegan. Pescatarian is close just add fish.
Im 12 and suddenly lost weight("growing") so yeah and i hopefully might get mussel now, ive played soccer and me my friends and our coach take the game and practice seriously so my legs are ok but my upper body i want to work on so hopefully this works but i have to work on portion sizes and diet
Man I hate water
Make full day diet plane video...
Solve the biggest problem, make vegetables taste good
Okay I feel like he works his biceps everyday there just really big to his other body parts like they're just really distracting
Thanks Jeff for everything you teach us humans.
What if you only eat one snack a day? Like you eat healthy but also have a muffin or a cupcake?
Jeff Cavaliere, the first man on Earth to reach 0% body fat
Ughhh I just bought Dave’s bread! I know I know now I have to throw it out!
Is cereal a garbage food because I keep looking it up and I get both saying that it's sugary and bad for you but others say cereal is good because it has many nutrients and other things.
Great Video, really true
Love you jeff
Thomas delour + Athlene-x = me getting a six pack in a year!    Thank you Jeff for making this information free and available!
I don’t want to hear this!!!
Where is the nutrition plan no one cares what ur saying
your so good !
Hydrate homie
Jeff's not so ripped here
I like the rants
At 1.26 I thought Jeff Is going to beat me..
Trying to get into eating right, right when Im about to go on vacation and have delicious crap foods shoved in my face. Im smart!
i just got motivated betwen "i practice what i preach" and "f*** the macros" and the last chocolate line was epic. love it!
A KFC AD shows up before this video. Wtf!
aight guys doing a shit load of reps ain't gonna get you a six pack it depends on how you diet and the way you eat .
Alcohol for me. Love a night out
I've went from 200 lbs to currently being at 186 lbs I still eat some of my favorite foods like pizza and maybe McDonald's once a month but I've been drinking at least 6 bottles of water a day and I rarely if ever have cake or ice cream really anymore last time I did was on my birthday
I just came for the comments.
Was just on a really bad fitness channel about this started to look at other videos saw ATHLEAN X imediatly changed to it
I've recently started using those zero cal water sweeteners. Probably not the best for ya, but literally every one of my diets have failed because of sugar cravings. One week in and feel pretty good.
I'm tryna get off that thor endgame bod
Jeff is the man!
🤤 *stared Jeff's Abs*
He needs to do a video on how to develop shoulders.
What are the best things to snack on? Are nuts, berries, carrots, and celery alright? Also beef Jerky?
Feel motivated
Do u need to cut all like fast food out of your diet or is it ok if you have it once a week or something?
Great tips
fuck the macros!
This guy actually just seems really kind, and honest.
Well that might work for you, but unfortunately i eat healthy and was only able to achieve a six pack or "abs" on a low calorie diet counting macros. For the most part i have to work super hard to get my bf down..  otherwise, i sore my fat in mid section. I agree with you for the most part, but i dont think everyone can get a six pack without extremes atleast the initial shedding of weight.
Sugar .... how to give up ??
reading my mind
reading my mind
This is good stuff!!!!!!!!!!!! It got me thinking... there is a lot of mirroring with the discipline of our spiritual lives, that you can see in working out, having a healthy diet, and making lost lasting changes that you begin to enjoy. amen
Who else is watching this while eating Reese
What should I eat on a rest day?
really appreciate your sincere approach to sharing what you have learned.  sometimes its tough to sift through all the fitness scams out there.  happy to have found your channel!
Why do girls like abs so much??
hi love the channel, I had a question about staying on a diet. I find my self able to stick to a diet for a couple of weeks but if I get too tempted at an event like a wedding or parties. I get derailed from my diet and it takes a long time to get back on the diet. what do you recommend to do at events where people expect you to eat with them out of tradition? my problem is when I see the tempting food in my face I have a hard time to say no, I got a food addiction that takes a lot of effort to control.
What are the macros tho?
I eat steak every day.
Great advice.  I appreciate you sharing with us not only your experience.  But also your no b.s. approach to a better life.  Taking care of our body, also takes care of how we take care of others.
Son
What
Jeff : Cut the crap  Me : Literally eating ice cream
Are eggs good or no
Yep.... I'm gonna go home and get rid of all my junk food now...
Should I shift to weed from alcohol? Would that help? I am actually asking this seriously
Thanks alot! I am almost there! Is there anything against when u have "eating attacks"? How to prevent them?
I love this guy
Reale st guy on the Internet! Thank you for all your help. I have been a slob for 4 years after a tendon tear in my tricep. I got lazy and complacent. It was easier for me to go from 110 lbs to 195 lbs muscle, than it has been for me to go from 200 lbs fat to 190-195 lbs fit.
My goal is to achieve 12% body fat
Should you eat foods that your mum makes
I thought eating more often jacks with your insulin?  Isn't this why Intermittent fasting works?
I feel better feeding after workout.. do i sti have take citruline malate before wk out?
ive been eating nothing but healthy whole foods, high protein, working out 5 days per week for 30-45 mins per day, drinking nothing but water for the past 4-5 weeks. Im finding it easy but also frustrating that im yet to see any results. I know 4-5 weeks isnt long at all though. I’m at 70kgs right now, lost 2kgs over the 4 weeks. Im just worried that i wont see any physical changes even after a couple more months.
I've got told to eat more and then I've been told to eat less idk wich one
cut the crap=fax
I love your videos mainly because you have the PT training side of it so you stress best form but in this vid i think it would be great to tell people more details like certain fruits like bananas cherries grapes have the highest sugars while strawberries blackberries raspberries have lowest glycemic or sugars also Tell them have balanced meals like pressure cooked sweet potatoes jasmine rice grillled chicken breast as opposed to bad fried or oil or buttered varieties etc. these dietary things really make he xtra difference in attaining some serious beach abs baby!
When i was a kid i was skinny and fit because i was always outside biking and things, now i am 30 years old unhealthy, have chest pains often, trouble breathing, i weigh about 210 lb's (fat not muscle). last week i decided i'm going to do exactly what you said, i'm going to cut the crap. For once i stopped telling myself "today's the day i'm going to go for a jog" and i actually just said the hell with it and i did it. i Thought i was going to throw up when i was done but i did it, and from here forward i'm going to do my absolute best to be healthier, build up some muscle and lose some belly fat! Wish me luck everyone. I hope these videos will help me through this process!
11:52
"If you have to question whether it's excess, It's probably excess" Made me giggle
The only one thing I don't like about Jeff is that he's an advocate of creatine. I don't believe creatine is healthy.
Dumb question but should butter be avoided at all costs? I particularly like it with chicken breast to make it less bland
Got the top 2 abs down but no sign of bottom and I might just have 4 abs but I am stuck at this point because I am cutting but the thing is not much actually nothing has changed in last 3 weeks .. what should I do?
This guy doesn't know what he's talking about. If you want a 6 pack just buy it at 7/11.
Watched and loved this a long time ago.   But as people are approaching me asking "what are you doing", I revisited it, and appreciate it even more.  Jeff, your information is like a fine wine:  Only gets better as the listener becomes better educated..  thank you.
I love this video. I watch it like once a month to keep my ass on track.
Holy shiet Jeff looks different back here to now.
In regards to drinking more water, does it mean having to get rid of milk since it's sugar> Natural sugar (lactose) but sugar nonetheless. I'm sorry but cutting sugar completely is impossible. Our bodies run on glucose, our brain runs on glucose in addition to fat.
11:52
I have a question to ask all of you. I get how you should cut out crap like pizza cake etc but I am confused at what do you do at parties where you didn’t have time to bring your own food and all they have is junk food? Do you eat it on occasion or no? Please help
Back in the day when Jeff said the word diet.
My cheat code is HOME_COOKED_MEAL Vietnamese food that involves a lot of veggies are REALLY good for the health nuts.
Love this Brother from another Mother always being Real and Honest, Much Respect..Semper Fi✊
“Get rid of the sippy cup guys ...”. Now that’s funny!
The 1.7k thumbs down are because you insinuated their habits were child-like LOL. How dare you? GREAT INFO - KEEP IT UP!!!
Just starting at the gym so I appreciate this video man❤️
Wish this was called "nutrition plan..."
Ugh I just love to eat....
What about IF? Aka dont eat often
You are right. I needed this. I need to revisit. I am seeing the packs but there is still a veil to break down. I want to take it to the next level. As a massage therapist, it is not easy to eat more often but when I do eat, this is where you are right. I should have an arsenal.of the right stuff. We have lots of water but the employee Dining Room only has very few to offer. I have to bring it. Thanks.
So true and truthful I love this guy
I love my juice though.
You have different body then all of us so why did you make this video?
So you said eat through out the day, but most of the time I'm not all that hungry.
What's a good diet to build muscle and get abs?
Nice !!
i wanna hug youuu jefff,,, please be my boyfriend
Its like throwing a deck chair off the titanic 😂😭😭
Love your videos, been watching them more and more lately. The results speak for themselves as you are a living demonstration of what positive dedication will give you. Im trying to eat better n be healthier overall, your videos have inspired me to continue on with that goal. Keep up the good work.
Hey FAT GAL ABBS,,again i drink at least  GAL OF water a day,,limon s,& vinager with the mother, & I've just started to add pink salt ,,,I've never been a salt user till now that in been workin out,,,  no soda  ,no coffee ,,, ,,, DO i need MORE WATER INTAK  ,dailey ??,,,,,,,,,as allways thanks for the inspiration,,,,,& motivation,,,,
Who else already had abs but watches anyways
I don't get it, I don't eat crap. Junk food never crosses my lips the only liquid that I drink is water and coffee I have never liked sugar, I work out for 30 to 60 Minutes everyday weightlifting and Cardio consistently my body still doesn't look great been doing that for two years. My sleep is great and I have a low-stress job. Any other advice?
Love the videos
Thats all I drink is water flat out
If you have to think if it's excess, it is excess 😂😂
... did you say “n-m-n’s”  😳
No disrespect but how are you going to make a video on how to get a six pack when you don’t have one
Thank you for this.  It's what I needed to hear. <3
It's like throwing a deck chair off the Titanic! Jeff ~
shoutout to christian bale in machinist. Great film
Is otk to train your abs everyday or should i do every secod day?
@Athlean-X I eat 3 meals a day and two protein shakes with a hand full of kale blended. Should I be eating two extra meals instead of the shakes?
Can you elaborate on eating more often? 3 meals a day aren't enough? 3rd meal is probably a 20 Cal meal
Eating toast with peanut butter and jelly while watching this vid
Aloha Jeff! Any advise for a vegetarian, I just stop drinking beer, but I still drink Grey Goose 2 shots a day cardio is easy but my stomach is still fat
amazing advice, gj!
Simple way to get ABS.. Face a breakup 💔 in life.. You'll get lean when depressed and ABS will appear automatically.
I wanna hear Jeff and Joe Rogan debate intermittent Fasting
man when you said cut the crap then went into the thing about the chicken tenders it really clicked. Like common dude you're looking at that fast food menu and you know there is grilled chicken versus chicken tenders and that's if your forced to eat on the go. I've been bullshitting myself
how does eating more frequently keep you blood sugar steady?
Supplements are expensive asf but
Milk is a great way to get protein. I get in 12g protein per glass (about 4dl milk in a glass for me). Right now Im about to have a protein shake with chocolate whey 100, 4dl milk and some cinnamon. This shit tastes great. It's something id be drinking even if i didnt care about my macros.
11:51 "F*** the macros, guys". - Jeff Cavaliere 2015.
Super solid video
Damn good stuff
"Keyboard Scientists" alright, i'm officially dead hahah
Jeff Keep doing RANTS!!! This is my favorite vid - kicks my ass(brain) everytime. DO MORE!!!  Thank YOU!!!
I just ate a large order of fries, how are you
Bro the no bullshit videos have helped more than anything.THANKS
Love your advise but your quote "like throwing a deck chair off the Titanic" so true
I have been in the lifestyle of weight training and eating well since my early 20 and I was as ignorant and dormant to the truth about my food and how often you eat you need to educate yourself in term of finding out wht is health food and animal eating has no health in it for human, eating every 3 hours is a myth an very unhealthy  Do open your mind cus you have a lot of power with the right info at hand to share please I'm not knockin you the (the truth about your food)you'll find so much info and great professionals to guide you
1:42  Jeff : I was the absolute worst eater on the planet.  Me : Nigguuuh its people out here weighing six hunnuh an fiddy pounds 😁🤣
Bla bla bla bla you read like a parot  write a full exemple 6 meals plan daily diet idiot!!!
Can honey Bunches of oats help you
You talk too much than tips
I love your videos thank you so much ! You have helped me to transform my life !
What about arizona green tea is that ok?????!
1:55 Migos' inspiration for Rain Drop, Drop Top
I have a question I am 14 and I have some abs but not as much arms I am skinny I wanna bulk up but will the abs go away? Or should I eat less?
Jeff telling the truth as always. Thanks for your videos!
Lmao 11:50 love it!
Amen Jeff! U're a great Guy!!!
But but but but... you don't have even abs
that machinist reference got me off guard lol
So what i eat more often???
What about intermittent fasting. Is it advised to eat frequently than fast.
People still be like "I guess I gotta buy his supplements, maybe then I'll have a 6 pack."
This guy is manipulating people to his benefit with lies about him eating unhealthy or being overweight 1. He doesn’t show prove or pictures 2. He doesn’t not have any stretch marks, but at the same time his info helps those who have been in those situations.
10:56 real talk, felt like he was talking to me .
Jeff eating ring ding's and snowball's for lunch...LOL
F*#K the Macros! My favorite part
I have a six pack but ive always had trouble with that last layer of fat on the lower abs. Ive gotten rid of it before but i was doing so much insane HIIT cardio i was started dreading gym sessions.
Great advice.....so true
Great advice.....so true
Literally a terrible video. No diet plan whatsoever
EVERY...FUCKING...VIDEO...dude is a legend I swear...Any piece of advice that comes out of his mouth I take seriously because Jeff knows his shit so lets pay attention.
I learned in intro to nutrition that supplements aren't as good as the real stuff and really don't make a good substitute
My personal meal plan: Breakfast, 2 eggs w a touch of olive oil w green pepper and a touch of cheese and a piece of bread/toast and a cup of milk or black coffee: a little over 300 cal, 20g ish of protein. Lunch: 2 Chicken breasts w broccoli and cauliflower: about 350 cal, 60 ish grams on protein. Afternoon protein shake: 120 cal 24g protein. Dinner white beans and mixed veggies: 260 cal, 20g protein. (Or switch that with lunch don't matter)
I started eating posted portion sizes on things that seem healthy and I've already noticed my neck slimming down, can't wait to see where this takes me.
Aye jeff quick question and please answer.   Are beans good for muscle growth?
This is by far the hardest part of getting a 6 pack
a perfect example of a no bullshit Italian American
2:12 I think i drink too much water. Is there such a thing as too much of it?
Great! nutrition is the key
Thanks Jeff!!!
Is ferrero rocher good for 6 packs?
ripped cavemen didn't eat every 3 hours.  Love ya Jeff but your wrong about the frequency of eating...ll
Sab moh maya h jo aya h wo jyega hi..Six pack wack sab bekar h
"F*ck the macros!" love it lol
i eat intermittent fasting 20-4 and i have the best abs in my life. i feel great, full of energy all the time.
Yoo Jeff how good is ACV
Only Jeff has biceps bigger than triceps? Wow
There is NO NUTRITIONAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SLOW-COOKED AND QUICK OATMEAL.  Good grief.  It's just cut up smaller.  Just don't buy the flavored or sugary packs.  Eating more often is moronic.  It's truly moronic advice for people who already overeat and already snack constantly--that is, 90% of America.  The less often you eat, within reason (meaning at least 2 meals), the LESS OFTEN your get hungry, as long as you're eating on a schedule.  You don't know anything about circadian hunger entrainment.  It's real and it's an incredibly effective tool for food management for people who overeat.
I need to ask a serious question...I'm a subscriber and watch you all the time. I'm a 55 year old female 115 lbs trying to gain a lot of muscle. With that being said...everyone tells me I NEED to start creatine. Now that scares me because I've been told horrible things about it AND it makes you lose hair! I decided to ask you about it. I really need advice. Thanks
This guy has been 100% help on my journey. Needed to hear this one. ✊🏼
just eat less  but without sugar and the other process stuff  and eat a LOT of veggies, in between meal just eat fruits if you are hungry . If you do this , you will notice the difference in two weeks ( assuming your workout and cardio routine is consistent)
Youre biceps broo
Ooooh Jeff you said diet!!!
Another great video 🙏🏼 very much appreciated 💪🏽😎🇦🇺
lmao I’d be willing to bet the people that dislike this video are the same people that talk about fat acceptance and believe plus size models are pretty.
thanks bro is pasta good for healthy gym foods etc
I am totally motivated now!
"F*** the Makros" Thanks for saying that. :D  I had a hard time to figure out the Makros and it didn't made sense to me, because I wanted to change my eating-habits and train for a better healthier way of living.
Legend has it Jeff was on the Titanic.
The Doritos ad i seen before this vid started isn't helping
Thank you Jeff keep making a difference
"FUCK the macros guys. If I hear macros one more time I'm going to puke." LMAOO. I cackled, that was hella unexpected. But word, Jeff spits straight facts.
Is nutella good for abs routine workout? allowed?
Someone plz tell me how to eat carbs for a 6 pack ,lot of opinions on it ,I m confused
I dont know how he can say "forget the macros" because eating a diet that consists of 20% protein 40% fat and 40% carbs isn't gonna get you abs i'm sorry
ok someone please show me how to eat 2300 calories a day without eating food loaded with carbs and fat because i can eat healthy but i only make it to about 1300 on a good day and feel hungry 24/7 (which also makes me lose muscle).
You do care😌😌😌
I just go5 a little bit of fat on my lower chest
What should i eat for morning? Evening? Night?
inspirational asf
“Fuck the macros” awesome
F*ck the macros guys. Get your shyte together lol
Sir i am from UTTAR PRADESH.I want to build my bicep and loose my belly fat at sametime.what should i eat.
Eat more often or do intermittent fasting?
Question: From what I can tell, the so-called 'shred' or 'fat burning' supplements (which I never use) are all just high doses of caffeine. I don't know the science behind caffeine's role in fat burning but in my case I don't drink coffee or tea etc. I only drink water, ever.  So it is my understanding that Caffeine raises your heart rate - which to me is artificial. That can't be good for your heart, in my uninformed opinion. So is there a non-caffeine (aka guarana) supplement that does the same or a better job?  Am I correct about the Caffeine???  In the end, for me, cardio is the best way to lose fat along with a good diet and all that this video mentions.
common sense solutions. good video.
Whe tee is your six pack
good tips .. start to write down all what you eat ... and you will be surprise !! all you can eat bad stuff ... after you cut the crap !!
I did not understand a single thing this super cut dude said :(
Dude u seem cool, but u always tell us what not to eat.. tell us WHAT TO EAT!!..now u cut the crap so I can subscribe plz..
Jeff, you said you’d be shocked if we didn’t know what the bad stuff we have to cut out. I’m ready to shock you. I already cut the crap out of what I eat. I eat often, and drink a cup of black coffee in the morning, and water the rest of the day. You forgot to mention that sometimes, genetically some just weren’t meant to have abs
Here in 2019
Needed to hear that! Thank you!
It’s so crazy it just might work!
what are your opinions of canned veggies? mainly low salt canned veggies.
my crap is Skittles and Coke.. Skittles and Coke are straight up Evil, and they work together.
Got it Jeff!
your workout made me fat and i have a 8 pack a i losed it
I ate so good for like 2 weeks and I had a late night and got fast food, I felt so bad after eating that shit
6 pack abs?hah no ill pass on that i have 8 pack abs 😎😎😎
Pffff talking too much without real informations ..
is natural juice good or not ?
I have a question. So I've cut the crap, I eat good, I eat often, I work a very physically demanding job, and exercise at least twice a day, at least 45min weights in the morning, and at least 45 min no weights in the evening. But I have a biological problem. It's called none alcohol fatty liver disease. Basically fat builds on my liver rather then being dispersed across the body. So my question for Jeff and any one reading this, is do you have any real advice for someone like myself?
Imagine him without traps. He has a long ass neck lol
Your a legend
is eating sugars in plain yogurt and fruit just as bad as table sugar. When people say to cut sugar does that mean you should cut natural sugar out?
Did you really just bleep yourself....lmao
Did you try to grow a..... MUSTACHE!!??? 😮😮😮😮
What if I'm already have a habit of IF everyday, like skipping breakfast then eat at noon then dinner at 7? Would that be bad? Because as I observed, I can only eat so little during my eating period so I actually prevent surplus calories. However, mr love handle is so clingy. Huhhhh....
Is this for all Ages?
Jeff, what would you recommend for people who travel a lot for work and aren’t able to either meal prep or whose schedule gets in the way of being able to as often as they should? Thanks, love the videos!
These do not work on people who are abuse of supplements, and Over Steroids, these is for only people who train not just hard but smart and only for the "NATURAL PEOPLE" just like Athlean.
He keeps it real keep it simple do what you know where you lack at and be honest with yo self 👌🏽💯🇵🇸
Am I tripping or this dude has a long neck?
Jeff you are great! I know this is an older video, but it's a good one! I just want you to know, you were my first channel that I subscribed to years ago... I did it because of your honesty and professionalism! Just a little support.... Greetings from Slovenia!
Stabilizing your blood sugar by eating more frequently ? I thought eating often is what causes spikes in your blood sugar levels.
Cmon, you were in the womb with abs I bet. Lol
Any good brands of instant oatmeal? I live life on the road and dont have the luxury of a stove.
but domino is delicious, and they offer coupon.  (evil laugh)
Hi Jeff, great video. Just looking for a little clarification. From some of your previous videos you've said we need to be in a caloric deficit to lose fat and weight. Here,  for step 5 you say give your muscles the calories and food they need to grow. Would you recommend being in a caloric deficit until abs start to show then ramping up the caloric intake to help build muscles?
Everytime you eat, you Insulin spikes.  Eating more often is not the way. IF and Keto works much better.
FUCK MACROS
Very informative video.i'm also a bodybuilder,competitor and a fitness coach. I was 230lbs,now i'm 170lbs. Well said brother.Keep it up brother! Thumbs up! God bless! 💪👊👍
I’m a kid and when my mom packs my lunch she packs a bag of chips and I replace it with a bag of carrots but she gets mad at me 😂
Not easy if your fam constantly buys disgusting shit such as Belgium waffles with chocolate sauce and cadburys chocolate box staring right at you all over the house, but I'm pushing through it.
Dude you make none sense WTF .
I'm a female. Thank you for your tough love and advice
Such obvious stuff yet so sad how many people think chicken strips or orange juice are healthy choices.
Excess alcohol.. If you have to question if it's excess, it probably is. Hahaha loved it. Alcoholics burrnn
Thanks 🙏🏽 a lot, going to change my shit
Man I had a 12-pack but I drink it before I came to the comment section!
6. Fuck The Macros! 😂 Jeff you legend!
Is Friday night drinks with the boys every week, but not drinking any other time considered too much?????
Love the tough love! Thank you! While I feel I'm pretty healthy, I've always been trying to fight for abs and it doesn't help when coworkers bring donuts to the office or their kids Halloween candy or that everyone is going out for happy hour.
You should be more precise and detailed about the foods you should consume and the type of training you should do in the gym. E.g I-How to cut the carbs and increase the protein intake....
I’ve tried useing the abb shuffle on my phone but it doesn’t seem to work so well any tips on that ??
i believe you have 0% body fat
I ate Vegetables while watching this
God bless you man
"If you have to question its excess, its probably excess" hahaha fuck you man I ain't got no problem with alcohol, I got it all figured out. I drink, I sleep, i pee.... IN THAT ORDER! Boom see figured out. Btw I'm just kidding. But just bout the fuck you. Not the rest.
Hi there. You mentioned in the 5 simple steps to stay lean all round that every 17 weeks you should do a weeks juicing? What would that protocol entail in regards to what should be in the juices, how many a day and what times?  Many thanks
Flavored bubbly water.  Game changer
I'm gonna have to watch the video twice, didn't listen to anything he said the first time because of that body
👍💪🙏🇺🇸 Straight ! I want my six.
Drinking game: every time Jeff says "drink more water" chug 1L of water
I have type 1 diabetes
Here’s the overall lesson stop eating Macdonald’s and get your lazy ass up and run and work out 💪
Jeff, i am a man of 40 years old and I swear is in the supermarket where I have my big battle of cutting the crap. My cravings are always at the evening after dinner and is for crunchy stuff. I good friend of mind suggest me rise cookies with peanuts butter, which is ok. But many time i ended eating 3 or 4 with a banana in the top. Anyway I think I am on 25% of fat but they fat is hard to go away at my age. But like you say consistent and cut the crap. I do the rest of eating healthy, and every 3-4 hours, drink only water.  Need to cut the crap... 💪💪💪
"..ding dongs..ring dings.." 💀☠😂🤣😆😂🤣😆
Yeah but what should my macros be?
11:52 that was funny asf 😂😂
Savage mate just Savage...
You're the best of the best, Jeff 👌🏼
You are not at all "off topic"(you mentioned in the end). This was so right Jeff. We needed this. I needed this....atleast. good job.
Fuck the macros!
“If i hear that one more time I’m going to puke” LMFAO IM DEAD TRU THAT JEF TRU THAT
Juice + Breakfast pan cakes = bad results.
I didn't get abs after this video. WTF
This video is so real I started getting teary-eyed close to the end. Subscribed!
Ok goodbye Nutella. 😭😭😭😭
but oatmeal is my favoriteeeeeeee
You said one thing and i automatically subbed. Thanks for being real (:
He's speaking nothing but facts
I don't eat fastfood, cakes, don't drink soda. But I still have a fat layer on my abdomenal. I am thinking to cut eating fruits.
♡♥great info, great view♡♥
I wanted to listen to this but all I wanted to do during this video was rip off that wallpaper to the left and align it at the correct height with the other bricks. Please tell me someone else noticed
I'm quite surprised to hear him say "Excess alcohol" instead of just alcohol period...
Fuck the macros guys!..hahahahahaha
jeff is a superhuman
This shit got me motivated 🔥
Are quick oats ok ??
so where is the diet plan???
Please suggest  a good brand of oats.
Man i just love you
Dang, I needed this...I had a piece of cake because I worked out twice today.  Wish I would have watched this first.  Good reminders.
As an non American i completely lost my shit at around 1:40. Didn’t even know I still had that in me. Dunkin Donuts for breakfast, Ring Dings, Ding Dongs ...  In don’t even know what that is, but if it’s half as bad as ist sounds...
I am so sore. No pain no gain
Facts.
What about drinking kombucha
"if you have to question if it's excess, it's probably excess" this made my day
I’m Type 1 Diabetic so blood sugar is my problem. I’m not exactly good at controlling myself around food and ended up the hospital twice in April and May I think it was, at the beginning of this year. Once was not too long after posting a sundae and some pizza on snapchat saying “let’s get it.” I may have underestimated the amount of insulin I needed to inject.
Yea fuck macros!
generic boi
No more orange juice?
This guy really cares
Man, sometimes i feel like jeff gets so mad that after a video he goes behind the camera and is just like 'f*ckn macros piece of no good sh*t why the hell are people believing this bullsh*t' xD
I drew my six pack on my stomach.
Actually really helpful. Thx.mate
F**K Macros lol
If I buy your program on your website do you give examples of food to eat and recipes?
what about celery juice
One month away from 2 years alcohol, meat, dairy, soda, candy and fast food free. The hardest thing I binge on are raisins and goji berries. #Thestruggleisreal
He right
Do protein bars count as “crap” foods?
Because of this I've started eating steel cut oatmeal,  with 2 teaspoons of pure maple syrup (I'm Canadian)  and I find I do have more energy than the garbage I used to eat. I'm 51 and when I was 21 I was working out all the time but not eating properly so I was toned but my muscles wouldn't grow because of poor nutrition.  Lets see if I can make changes I need to make
This is like telling me in order to pass a test I need to study.
Can I like get an app on what to eat every day
Too much talking instead of telling the right information what to eat , what should not eat
Can you achieve anything close to a six pack if you've had a double mesh abdominal hernia? Arm and leg workout is fine. I use a back brace reversed in order to keep my stomach from ballooning out while working my arms, legs, chest and back. Nobody out here has any real information or tips on this matter. Can you help?
Here is my diet (or part of it) that has helped me look better (I do HIIT training and other cardio as well as strength/weight training, but the diet really helped the most):  morning:  eggs, oatmeal (slow cooked, no additives), water (I drink "sparkling" water to help me drink more as I like it more than tap); morning snack:  usually a banana, sometimes a whole grain type muffin, yogurt;   lunch (this is the difficult one because it involves more planning with work, etc):  sandwich (ham/turkey and cheese), banana or other fruit;  (workout is usually after lunch); mid-afternoon i have a protein shake (whey protein with different fruits and juice), sometimes oatmeal, sometimes a peanut butter sandwich (I try to minimize my bread intake though);  dinner: usually baked fish or chicken (if I have left overs, I eat them for lunch) with rice and veggies (varies), sometimes I have baked lean pork chops (rice/veggies as well).  I never eat in the lat evening before bed.  And I'm drinking water all day long.  I never drink sodas (completely cut them out about two years ago).  I try to keep my diet lean for lean muscle growth.  I don't load up on carbs anymore...even for long trail runs (but I do make sure I have food with me).  The areas I'm still working on:  making sure I get enough veggies.  That's the hardest one for me.  So currently what I do is I will eat an entire bell pepper as a snack (I love those).  I need to work on incorporating more greens during the day...but other than that I think I'm doing really well.   Also I eat tuna fish often...straight out of the can.  Lastly:  I don't drink or do any drugs. The other issue I am working on is making sure I'm eating enough...I've had issues in the past with eating enough in the morning.  Because my workout schedule is pretty consistent now (HIIT twice a week, afternoon workouts that involve strength/weight training/abs, etc), I've gotten better about eating more often.  Still working on refining that stuff though.
Who wants to see Jeff on a suite??????
Best get your shit together video
Very knowledgeable young man when it comes to fitness
Just eat healthy, and go outside ( I say as I lay in bed
Preach brother Jeff! I swear by all that he said because I too have seen the results and difference by following this advice. Even before watching this here today, I knew my diet was shit and I made drastic changes with it even before joining the gym. That was the first thing and it helped me feel good about the next step, which was putting the work in at the gym. I've lost over 30 lbs and over 10% body fat in just over 3 months and I'm feeling quite motivated to continue this as a true lifestyle change. At 50 years old, I knew my health needed a makeover and all of what Jeff has stated here has definitely worked for me. I always appreciate Jeff's straight up honesty and knowledge! Thanks for always sharing such important information!
Thank you so much
Is there any use of abs like biseps can help you lift weight leg muscles in running but abs???
The part he does not tell you is that as you age your metabolism slows down so much that just looking at crap food will make you fat.
I want to I really do but I have extreme gynecomastia which doesn't work with abs.
Is subway bad for you?
Appreciate ur sincerity ! Kindly just share the diet we need to eat to grow muscules in general yet in a balanced way, having all required neutritions!
Fuck Jeff, you’re making me want abs lol.
How do you eat often and maintain a 40 min gap before drinking water and loads of water
What about like calories and grams of fat you need to eat every day. You gotta explain it bruh
Lol he forgot to mention sleep
Cut out all oils and refined foods! Whole foods only!
Will you lose body fat even without fasting empying your glycogen storages first? I have read that your body doesnt necessarily use the fat storages until the muscles and the liver run out of glycogen. Is this as polar as this or will fat loss occur even if your glycogen doesnt run out. Also if the glycogen storages run out in about an our of medium intensity excersize, if i have understood correctly, does that mean that excersize sessions under 1 hour are good for nothing but preventing the generation of new fat tissue for a preiod of time as the glycogen storages arent as filled anymore
Its funny how air heads candy was an ad on this video
I’m fucking 12 and I got a six pack over night actually hit me up for pics if you think it’s fake
I cut sugar and increased my adderal intake. Worked like a charm.
"We tend to drink things in place of what we know we should be drinking..."  That hit home.
Is sugar free cordial okay? You know, you use a little bit of the stuff with water and it turns the water fruit flavoured. It has no sugar but i think it has sweeteners.
Make a video on face fats pleaseeee
I eat a sandwich, 2 candy bars, one beef jerky, and a Gatorade for lunch at work, and then eat some leftover dinner at home, and drink like 8 bottles of water daily. That's all I really eat. I eat fast food like once a month.   I weigh about 200lbs at age 28, and I lift free weights like 3x a week. All my fat is on my love handles, back and thighs.
I love this video. That last little pep talk was great. Thanks for the video. ♥️
I eat steak everyday ):
Preach to that. I’m gonna take this information and use it to the best of my ability.
Well I mostly do what he talks about since years (while although, I must agree, having up to 3 cheat meals per week), I endeavour to gain weight, especially muscle ofc but also fat, since, anyway, when I was skinny my abs were just barely noticeable, however today I'm "normal' but change is way too long, I'm getting bored whereas several friends of mine have abs and muscular bodies, not too fat nor too skinny by eating junk food and drinking Coca-Cola and alcohol a lot and smoking too... I think genetics play a pretty large role...
Does eating frozen totinos pizza count
Thank you!!!!
Hey. Plz suggest me right way to make my abs... Also how to shut my cravings.. 😶
Jeff, you know those were Jessie’s hands with press on nails at the start of the video.
but i can't afford the supplements too so what do i do ?
Cut crap, eat more often, cut less obvious crap, eat even more, eat supplements
The problem with eating more often is that it has a different effect in different body types. You tell an overweight person to eat 5-6 times a day it has the opposite effect. It may be good advise for a thin person but not for a fat person even if they make better choices.
Cut the bullishit. Eat more often. Chicken, Oat meal, water. Eat more of good foods for muscle growth.
Thx
What's a macro
I can at least smoke right?
Chuitya gando.
Am I the only one that thought that he was actually discussing a meal plan?
Bro you re talkin too much . Why don't you show me some food thats ok to eat and and not recomended.😥
Jeff, what do you think about INTERMITENT FASTING? Thanks for the videos!!
I have one weakness . . . . . Pizza
Even sauces like sour cream and chive and hummus there like 30 to 40 grams fat per 100g there a 200g tub I get throw 100g of each plus with all the other food I eat with fat in so what about the sauces
Thank you sir 🙏  Your Dope af 💯 🔥
68k view!!! Goddammmmm! And me to the list
Not the dad we deserve,but the dad we need <3
What about milk? Is milk better than water?
I needed this video today. I’ve been going pretty strong with a decent diet, consistent workouts, abs daily... and then last week I caved and ate not one, not two, but three pints of vegan Ben and Jerry’s last week. Thank you for hitting me over the head and reminding me that the momentary pleasure of the ice cream deletes the hours of sweat and hard work I put in earlier that day/week and sways me from my goal.
This guy looks like a buff version of Gilligan from gilligans island
Omg I was falling to sleep until the end, he said F#%@ the macros! I suddenly awoke lol..
Oatmeal sounded like opium and I was shocked till I realized that. The juice tip is true...get over the Tropicana man !
Do u know how to get a six pack for girls or does it work the same
How do you guys feel about calorie counting? I think I'm okay at eating healthy, I don't eat candy (outside of nuts and 70-80% dark chocolate And only in small amounts (less than 300 kcal)), and have a decently varied diet. I used to be fat, and am quite scared of gaining weight, even when training. Because of that I've been thinking of starting calorie counting again, so i can get a feel for how I'm gaining weight and whether or not I'm gaining muscle or fat.
So glad found this channel,  so easy to listen to and gets to the point with key facts rather than boring us with usual bullshit top marks again mate:)
Well I know what to cut out but I don't know what to put in... water?
What about 2 cups of almond milk a day unsweetened
No other way to put it, Jeff Cavaliere IS the real deal! Much respect for what you do and the help you give.
Your neck is very tl
What about milk with protein powder?
What about lipofin jeff? Eating more often prevents burning fat they say
Jeff youre a fucken legend I'm a 20 year old electrician from australia and I'm pretty athletic already but I'm gonna get shredded for you you mad dog
Need some help how much protein I my weight is 146 5’8 to build decent muscle but not like a bodybuilder
I love this guy!!!
Jeff what’s your thoughts on fasting
ur christian bale stunt double
Is green tea healthy enough to drink like 3 times a week or not? help me out please
love the honesty
Need to finish up my cut almost done then 6 pack training it is
thanks man
After breakfast I just eat salmon and vegetables and pasta
This video got 6 times the usual down-votes... I wonder why... lol. Thanks Jeff. You are the best!
“Fuck the macros!” 😀
Eat more often vs intermittent fasting
Good advice
You’re very straight forward. The videos are really helping me. Thank you!
I'm a foodie but altogether a fitness freak..... Its hard for me to maintain my fat % between 10 to 15.  But then also my abs are not clearly visible. Even when my fat % is below 15
Love you bro
F*** the macros! LOL
I’ve been working out for a month and a bit... it’s really hard to keep a consistent diet but this guy really has just motivated me!
Thanks man appreciate it working on the meal plan now free of sugtamd fast food feeling healthy and well
Fantastic video!
hi hotty  thansk for the tip ♡
how much is excess alcohol? how about 2-4 drinks per week? and by drinks i don't mean cocktails, i mean for example a glass of whiskey on rocks
What you want to say in this video is that you do not have to make a caloric deficit? That is, do you have to eat to increase muscle mass?. THANKS SO MUCH!
What the hell are macros?
No step on how to get abs nothing on what exactly I should eat nothing on how to work out this information for the most part was useless
does weed and cigarettes affect diet
"F*** THE MACROS!"
If you have to question if it's excess, then it's excess...facts!!!
*Fu*ck* the macros.. HAHAHAHAHAHA 😂
Soon as you get abs can you stop doing the abs work out as long as you continue eating healthy?
This is the real help thanks for the information
You said the excess alcohol how beers would be ok?
"fuck macros" indeed
Lost 50 pounds in 4 month just watching you. Thank you so much
I feel like I'll never have a six pack. I'm 15 ~125 5’9 and I'm around 14-15% body fat and I'm so close. i can move a tiny bit of fat away and see my abs but not just standing. I eat zero bad foods, only drink water and i have plateaued so severely. Does anybody have experience with plateauing and how to overcome it.
Why did I get a alcohol ad on this video?
What about intermittent fasting? OMAD? Keto Diet?
So if I dont do Intermittent Fasting and eat normal cutting all the junk out, what should i eat for breakfast before working out to lose belly fat while putting on muscle? And what to eat after n how often?
The man knows what he's talking about.
This got me motivated.
I love this guy. No bullshit, no beating around the bush. Just straight hard facts
i took 5 steps out of my chair.. didnt work....
It's near the end of the day so I'll have to start this plan tomorrow. I'm drinking water though currently, so I feel that I'm off to a good start lol. Already replaced the sugary drinks with tea/orange juice/water, and I'm a good milk drinker. I even cut out the one spoon of sugar from my tea. Better get back to eating porridge 🤔. I'm also looking to get more muscle and that 6 pack so I assume I need more protein/carbs?
Dang it! Tell me what to eat.
OK
Alright let's go, step one this is easy, " cut the crap ".. wellp I tried.. peace out
If you watching this it's too late. Lol. Na keep going.
Can you make a video on people with a big rib cage?
Try oatmeal w/ground organic turkey cooked w/some herbs and spices and some chopped mushrooms and a little salt and pepper, it's really good!
One thing I've noticed, is when you really do cut out all of the "crap" you eat and start eating lean meats and drinking water and milk, you stop craving them damn twinkies and snowballs. Like literally, it's like "should I grab a hostess or a cup of fruit?" and the cup of fruit sounds way damn better
Why does everyone want abs these days just train your core eat low fat eat more cals do some cardio and do a sport that your into. And drink bear water so you can digest your food it aint that hard i just watch athlean for any home workouts when my gym memeberships ends
As a 14 year old boy how do I achieve this because my mom prepares all of our meals and it is not always the healthiest
People be like “idk man. Sounds like a pyramid scheme” 😂
Thanks a million man, this is also just the first video I’ve watched of yours, and I can already tell that you know what your saying
Thanks bro your the man
Why does he have a skeleton for?😂
I want a sixpack to impress my myself. & to look sexy in the mirror & more confidence when taking my shirt of
Is a detour bar ok for a supplement. My body doesn't agree with whey protein shakes. Or is this considered me putting crap into my body?
While well on my way nutritionally, this vid provides much needed inspiration to keep it up and go even further. Ongoing self-evaluation of one's nutrition is essential. Lots of crap out there, be vigilant!
Starting it today. Thanks Jeff
Thankyou, thoose are the only words that come out of my mouth towards you. Thankyou
1. What is your body fat percentage ? 2. At what body fat percentage does someone start to see their 6 pack? 14%? 12%? 10%?
All he said was actually true. I ran track and field. Played  football. A lot of water will see results and cutting out all the crap will help tremendously. Especially as you get older.
I'm looking through the comments and it says drink water, which is good but should I start drinking water after workouts, or protein drink Plz respond
Lol, those that disliked the truth.
Jeff your the real deal!! this video changed my out look on getting healthy! Your channel will be the only motivation for me from now on... God Bless Jeff!! Thanks For Keeping it honest and simple..
Watching this as I eat delivery pizza lol
As ive said before Geoff, your vids are excellent but you still have a lot to learn about Nutrition. The between the line stuff info that has no 'agenda based promo.....
Ohh noo snowballs why,I love snowballs
Realized that after I cut all the junk I was like taking in 1000 cals a day max bec I was stuffed
What about hotdogs?
Just do sit ups everyday and u can eat what u want 🤣
Excellent insight!
I've had six pack abs since 6 without diet or any hard exercise is it genetics? Im not skinny btw :/
I just joined the athleanx family lol started my 22 day abb workout. Watching this just to see if I'm doing anything wrong I combine intermittent fasting with eating more often. Seem to reduce weight fast
I honestly can’t do my own workout or diet I feel like I need someone to tell me what to eat and what plan to follow on a workout probably gonna sign up for Athlean X
Guys... Cut the crap!!!!
If you question it's accessive, it's accessive. Oooooeeepppss. Ok.
Eating more often? But you get more insulin spikes meaning  you have a larger window that you cannot burn fat during the day. Intermittent fasting for the win
Thank you for bleeping out the bad language!  :)
Basically "Eat good food and don't eat bad food". Thanks
What to eat to gain muscle is so confusing with all these different opinions. The only FACT we know is water good🤔 until another scientist comes and says water ain’t good
Where is the list of food ?
like seriously, 1200 + people disliked this video 🧐. like why. keep up with the good work jeff
If you don’t take food as fuel  You are a fool 🌝🌚
Coffe??
What do you think about carbonated water?
Otis Spunkmeyer cookies...... Omg
Jeff I was wondering is it possible to burn fat and still grow taller if your a teenager   please I'm sure there is many people out there who would like to know and probably should know me being one of them
i was on keto diet for 2 months, I lost 8 kg, and 10 cm of waist size. since then I got back to my regular diet. I eat healthy. but I don't avoid craps all the time ! I mean I enjoy eating ice cream, chocolates and these sort of things every now and then, "not juice or soft drink though! that's my red line"! But apparently my genetic helps me get away with that easily! and My abs have been visible since I lost that 8 kg. which is 2 years by now! see what works for your body the best. I used to do heavy and intense endurance full body workouts for years, and that built my abs, then I got rid of body fat and made those abs revealing, although I don't do  that much ab workout really! I kind of hate it, haha ! finally, I have to say I agree with Jeff! keep your body fat level low by eating healthy (cardios are the least effective way to get rid of body fat, it's good for overall health and better blood circulation for sure, But not for fat loss. weight lifting works better in that matter I believe) , and workout to build muscle. and if you think you're a kind of person that gain fat even by drinking a glass of water, then that's probably hormonal problem. I recommend some sort of other diets, like keto, which I know Jeff is agains :D. well do your own research on it ;)
These are some great tips. I really need to watch this video to get that reminder of what I need to do on a regular.
What about pedialyte Jeff? I work outdoors and I sweat a lot. What do u recommend for electrolyte replacement?
“Fuck the macros” amen!
So if I'm a teen, do I just eat healthy foods, every 2 hours and cut soda, juice fast food and all the junk food in general? I am a triathlonist and I have been training for 1 year, and my abs are not quite there yet, though I do eat a lot of junk food cause I get hungry from my trainings
thee videos are purely the best and on point. i love them. Keep them up.
So inspiring...
What if I drink whiskey and h2o?
What is your weekly meal plan?
My name is jeff.
The day before my 19th birthday I promised no more more fast food, junk food, and pork. I’ve wanted a six pack for years and this time I’m gonna stay committed 🤘🏾
You’re very motivational and you serve quality content. Much respect man :)
don't go for a diet go for a lifestyle
I thought athlean x and gravity training zone were the same channel for a long time
rip my chocolate digestive biscuits.
ya I need need to just fix my bloated fucking stomach... I swear I must be allergic to somthing but I dont know what.
I would love to diet but we can’t afford to buy a lot of different foods
"It's like throwing a deck chair off the Titanic!" Lol. I love this phrase.
Just switch to Diet Coke and you’re good.
Water doesnt taste good. I want a healthy drink that tastes good.
Honestly I hate junk food so I'm good lol.
Fuck the macros!!!!!
How do you feel about intermittent fasting? Is it worth it ?
Can you give me a calendar that tells me what to eat everyday?
i thought you are gonna give us list of items to eat , everyone knows eating crap doesnt results into abs
Thanks Jeff! Your every video is better and better! Keep on the great work. Fingers crossed to get your YouTube channel to 10 million subscribers man.
Just eat less than 20g carbs, 0 sugar. Priority foods: 1.Protein 2.fat 3.fiber 4.carb less than 20g per day
So today I’m eating Hamburgers and hotdogs for dinner as a farewell because after today they’re gone
I have been eating like this. I mean quite often from an year. I now have a "Family pack abs".
Hey Jeff, ive been controlling my diet, ruling out sugar and working out abs intense. My core ab muscles have built up and most fat layers have been gone. But im stuck with this stubborn last layer of fat that just won't go. It's been 5 weeks. Any idea?
Sir can a person workout with carpel tunnel ?
this guy should cut the crap first. He won't give us any vital information, he just talks around the topic
This is why I love this guy! F*cking blunt!
I bought some steel cut oats as part of a plan to eat healthier.  The cooking of the oats in the morning is ridiculous and has prevented me from continuing it.  Are quick oats really a terrible alternative as there is no chance of me spending 40 minutes every morning to make breakfast.
Crap I should have watched this video before wolfing down an entire 10 inch pizza at one go ...
But what about beer!!
Oml while Jeff was telling me to cut the crap i literally started chomping on my oreos so loudly thinking "if my fatass can't hear you i won't realize that i really should cut the crap" 😂😭👋🍪
You are 100% right brother
I want to do this for me my self and I not to impress no boby but me.god willing
keyboard scientist .....
Step 1. Join wrestling= ez abs
I love this guy!! Education it the key... To know and not to do is not to know!! Thanks Jeff
Thanks
So I can’t eat this much. I know most people can’t. Drink water all day. Plain Oat meal and bananas. Or just a plain bagel and coffee. Bcaa before workout. Then after workout protein shake. Then later quinoa and broccoli which lasts me two days. Then protein shake. Again small amounts you don’t need 32oz of water and protein shake just have 8oz of water/protein as a meal replacement. Again I only really had two meals... and if you are drinking vodka soda. Maybe a splash of cranberry on top. No cheat days. No excessive sugar.
I don’t know 🤷🏽‍♀️ <3
you are a fucking god send legend mate.
I’d love to see before and after pictures of Jeff
six packs with six cars can impresse a woman
any amount of alcohol is excess it should not be drank by humans it has no nutritional or health benefit yet it destroys your liver and health not mentioning how alcohol can impair your decision making
you suck
Yes, this question is for Raymond- what is YOUR diet plan?
Tell me how to make body please
Hey Jeff, I hear what you're saying about the juice... But what if you ARE the Juice? What if you're basically juice with ice in your veins. I have that problem. Every time I do a crossover and then dunk, they all just say "Hes got the juice!" It sucks because I really know I need to get rid of the juice if I'm ever going to get fit. Help please.
honestly, substitute ALL drinks (sugary, alcohol, tea/coffee) for ONLY water, (including milk) make water the only liquid you consume, your brain, mind, gut, intestines/liver, eyes, skin, muscles, will thank you
straight and to the point. eat crap,look crap, eat good, look great
Please someone reply is it good to eat meat for six pack pr dont eat any meat even chicken
I had a toned 8 pack went on vacation and ate unhealthy once and now they're gone
i like u man ur honest and  good presentation u actually have a point  and it's right in to core of the problem most ppl have
Thanks Jeff. Good advice
Just recently made the conscious decision to live a healthier life. Not sure I will ever see my abs but I have completely changed my diet. I'm almost on a low carb paleo type diet. Lots of fresh fruit and veggies for snacks, good lean proteins(good thing my chickens are laying big time). I have inadvertently removed all processed foods and sugars from my diet. the beauty of it is that I have cut the crap (well aside from the sixer of brew on my days off)and I love what I am eating. I feel better and lost about ten pounds with light workouts( prepping for the gym) and following this diet. I just recently discovered your channel I like that you're an "old guy" like me as well as the fact that youre not just some muscle head but also a physical therapist.  Youre a great coach and Im taking your advice to heart. I'm now hitting the gym almost daily and working on different zones every day. I feel great!! THANKS FOR THE HELP
kam bola kr be tu sidha point pr aake diet bata 😐
I love fitness, fittinthis junk food in my belly
You nailed it man
One of the most useful channels... Keep it up... 💪🏼
Damn, Jeff went hard at 11:51. Thanks (hard-ass) uncle Jeff!
I eat way too much fruit, dried fruit, fruit in yogurt, fruit in oatmeal, plain fruit. And a deep love for halo top ice cream but I eat it only once a week 🤣
Thanks. Great video.  ☺️
"Having Trouble STICKING with the Paleo Diet? What is the Paleo diet? What are the basics? Briefly, the paleo diet refers to feeding according to the ancient habits of nutrition. The first time that this form of diet is considered as a diet program is the gastroenterologist Dr. It's based on work by Walter L. Voegtlin. In his book The Stone Age Diet, published in 1975, Voegtlin emphasized the importance of "returning to the body" in human nutrition, and today it has also laid the foundations of the paleo diet. The basic principles of this diet, which has been developed by many scientists over the years, are as follows:  Fresh fruits and oil seeds are among the most consumed foods of the Paleo diet Fresh fruits and oil seeds are among the most consumed foods of the Paleo diet Since agriculture had not yet occurred in the Palaeolithic period, people were fed only with wild plant roots that they had acquired through the flesh of the animals they had hunted and gathered. Because of this, baked goods such as sugar and dairy products can not be consumed within the paleo diet. However, there is no restriction on the consumption of vegetables and fruits. Moreover, in the paleo diet, which is as simple and primitive as possible, nothing that is not obtained by natural means is consumed. So if you are going on a paleo diet, you have to get the processed foods out of your life. At the same time, the Paleo diet believes that it is necessary to feed "raw" as much as possible. How is the Paleo diet done? If you are planning to start a Paleo diet, you must first know that this diet is not a classic program to continue until you say goodbye to a detox or overweight. It is useful to learn some rules when starting this one, which should be made a way of life in order to attain a healthy and durable body just as stone-devout people have:  https://bit.ly/2GJRqDT
I was 16 pounds and lost that in 3 months I drank water and I was on the protein works
4:25 best honest advice/tip you will ever get
This video is too long , just say important things
Tha alcohol is what gets me. Beer in particular. Lately been drinking strictly vodka water but I drink 3 times a week on average so.
You and alpha M are all I need in life
I need his body
About the part with skipping juice and drinking more water. What about milk? I drink alot of milk and I've always thought that was good for excersise.
2:28 😂
Another great tip and I will check out the website to get more nutrition info. Thanks
Almost 5mil🔥
Y am i taking info of someone who doesnt rly have strong abs.
FUCK MACROS!! Wait... what are marcos?
So if I cut out the junk food and bad food it doesn’t matter what I eat? Please help I’m confused
Who the heck unlike that video 😐
I don’t have a wife.        I’m so blessed!
I m skinny and 41kg which kind of eating i can for six packs
Hello my age is 45 years Is it possible to get six pack abs?
Can I get abs from banging fat rails of coke?
Diet Plan for 6 Pack Abs (STEP BY STEP!)Then  Get 6 pack abs year round by following this diet planhttp://athleanx.com/x/diet-plan-for-a...  Click and what? Store... No diet plan. Another troll/spam :(
11:51 FUC* THE MACROS GUYS.
I have bee hives, so my guilty pleasure is honey.  I can limit it to 30g a day, but it's all in a single serving.  My pre-workout consists of a full serving of nonfat Greek yogurt 237g mixed with the 30g of honey.  That and a serving of C4 and I'm good for 30-45 min high intensity workout.  I just don't want to give that up.  High protein, no fat, great energy, except although natural, the sugar content.
😂😂sometimes his videos are so funny with how frustrated he gets "if I hear macro one more f*king time" haha
“U KNOW WHAT COMES WITH A RANT? ...THE TRUTH”  -Jeff Cavaliere -
I have a ridiculous amount of food allergies... sometimes I have no idea what I CAN eat that isn't going to kill me... I am really not sure what I can eat that will go well with a diet plan... even various vegetables can cause a allergic reaction. Nightshades are the biggy: potatoes, peppers, paprika, tapioca, tomatoes but also eggs, too much red meat, some types of lentils... this is just the start of the list. I get depressed when it is time to eat because I am not sure if even things I generally know are safe will cause a problem in some combination. If I don't strictly follow this I pay, and pay dearly: I get gout so bad I black out from the pain and it doesn't go away for weeks. I've come to feel I cannot trust any food completely.
fuck the macros
I’ve currently lost 77lbs in 5 month and it wasn’t to impress anyone but myself and you have hit the nail in the head mate, this video is 100% but not necessarily for the six pack but for overweight people like I was 37% bodyfat I am now 11.7% and do not have abs but your info is 100% on the money to help get in shape
Thank you!! awesome video.
i hate too much talking just get to the fucking point😡😤🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿
He said cut the crap right as i was shoving Mac in cheese into my mouth
I like his attitude. I really love to cook and recently my church did a 21 day fast. I lost some weight and I felt good. All I did was cut sweets and bread. Oh and I haven't drank any soda in 4 months
Jeff head aches by starting to train and eat properly how do you handle that. Also 6 ft 255 have a good 50 to lose and I am very sore the first week going for massage . How should the bad soreness last before you get in the groove . 1 mo 2 mo ?
11:52 about fucking time someone said it! We don't need Macros to have a great body composition, we need the proper healthy nutrition in proper portions!
rule one  DONT FUCKING SAY TMO I WILL EAT AS MUCH AS I WANT THEN THE NEXT DAY I WILL START MY DIET AND WORKOUT  CAUSE THAT SHIT AINT GONA WORK I BEEN SAYING THAT SHIT FOR 3 YEARS BEFORE I STARTED MY COMMITMENT
How do I eat well and convince my girlfriend to when she always wants to eat the “healthier” options at fast food places?
I don't like creatine :/
I'm trying to use excersize to motivate me to start eating healthier as well. Onec I see a difference in how strong i am with the push ups and weight lifting I do, I will start running and cutting dairy and proccesed food out of my diet
Yes hello, we're hired attorneys writing on behalf of Dunkin Donuts. We're going to sew you for talking bad about our products. You should be hearing from us in the male about the court hearing date. Over and out.
How many of u actually look at his face instead of some other place when hes talking 😂
Many thanks Jeff.
Won't you get more fats if you eat more often because excess energy from food will be stored as fats
Is meat and rice good? The meat has some sort of sauce on it tho
my best tutor!
Thank you master you are the best
Speaking Truth brother
Don't worry about all of this advice. Just eat a bag of sugar-free gummy bears to cleanse your body.     NO, DON'T DO THAT. Seriously, just Google people's reactions to that crap.
I was eating cheese cake while watching this.
Damn! That's some kickass advice! I really appreciate it Jeff!
"If you have to question whether it's excess, it's probably excess" lmao
What about beer?
going on a donut run, anyone want something?
Great
11:53 gets me by surprise and still cracks me up lol that's why I love this dude. He's the most real and down to earth youtuber I've seen.
I eat fast food for dinner at lunch all the time and iam still thin but I want abs
This is so opposite to the Intermittent fasting and Ketogenic diet - So confused now.
I just study these videos and do what applies to me not everything these people say is set in stone for everyone and you should probably know yourself and how you should take care of yourself to get your own best results
Been on your 22 day ab challenge/workout. I'm on my 6th day and, I admit I skipped a day. However, I have already knocked today's 7 min ab drill. Good stuff so far. Keep the honest info coming!
This guy...no bullshit, tells it like it is...yeah this guy, I like this guy.
Can you have a six pack with a 2500 calorie diet?

Please make more videos on meal prep. I am an audio learner as well as visual. Thank you Jeff for all you do for us. As a Marine Veteran that has memory loss this would be very helpful. Currently on the XERO plan and doing the readiness afterwords.

Hi. Jeff. I am 27 years old and a Vegan. I take medication for BP. I got that a couple of years ago due to stress, anxiety and palpitation(my heart is absolutely fine, normal and in good condition).   Now I am perfectly normal. I do cardio in gym. My doctor suggested me not to do:  1.lift weights,   2.push ups and chinups.  Please suggest me exercise on how can I develop muscles and a good physique without doing the 2 things I mentioned above. I want to stay healthy man.  I appreciate all the information you are passing to the world.   I will be happy if you could provide me with a detailed workout plan.  Look forward to your early response.  Thanks and regards Adi  Respect from India.

Great video! in Jeff we T R U S T
Intermittent Fasting??? What say ye??

Love these videos, man. Deep stuff!! Don’t know how else to say it. But truly great, great advice!! Wish I had this 20 years ago.
Only water, okay  *pours a bowl of cereal and adds water*

What are macros? As in Microsoft word macro?
In most cases, he is right, although he forgot one very important thing: for a healthy body, great abs, big muscles, etc, etc, you must cook using raw ingredients. If you don't cook using as un-proccessed as possible ingredients, no way to achieve those goals. Cooking has three advantages: (1) you control what you are eating, so you can eat healthy (no hidden sugar, no hidden salt, no margarine or other trans-fats, etc), (2) you save a lot of money (yes, buying raw ingredients its way of cheaper than buying processed food), (3) the food can be very tasty, because you can use THE real, natural super-flavors: vegetables (like tomatoes, chillis or onions), spices (black pepper, nutmeg, ginger, garlic, etc) or herbs (thyme, rosemary, basil, coriander, etc). By the way, even your own made burgers or pizza can be a far cry from what you can buy. For burgers, i mince the meat, i make my buns (i prepare the dough from flour and yeast), I use quality cheese, tomatoes, onions, avocados, lettuce or spinach,maybe an egg, and for the sauce, i usually prepare a Gorgonzola one. Of course, with no french fries on the side. After I have learned to prepare my own burgers, I feel I am going to  puke when I feel the smells from major fast-food chains.
Love all your videos man. Admire so much dedication and consistency. Great job and thanks. I'm 5'11" and weight only 160. My frame is lean but you can see the potential for me to be 20 lbs heavier with mostly muscle.  How can I up my weight without going too crazy on weight supplements. Thanks and keep pumping.
can't believe he's 42, 5'10 and 170lbs...I'm same height and 175 , but so not even close to how ripped Jeff is
When in doubt, drink water
great video for over all health
While training like once in a while or few times a week coffee

How many macros should we eat? Jk😂
i honestly don't know what the crap is in my diet what i eat regularly is as follows, 2 fried eggs with some toast, then for lunch either pasta hot-dogs or a home cooked burger, then for supper it's usally rice with peas chicken and soy sauce
How good are bananas???
Orange juice? I love orange juice it makes me feel good

heres the summary....clean nutritious foods....watch the fat oils and processed foods....soo chicken lean proteins REAL CARBS!! potatoes rice pasta grains oatmeal...minimize fats and dont drink your calories..AND VEGGIES AND FRUITS AND WATER...I DO THIS IM FUCKIN 50 YEARS OLD U DONT NEED TO COUNT OR MEASURE SHIT...it automatically puts you where u need to be. simple YOURE FUCKIN WELCOME ROCCO NYC
I have a question for you guys I went from cereal to steel cut oats for oatmeal will that help at all ?
I'm pretty new to this game. I'm a skinny guy trying to put on more muscle, been hitting the gym with a trainer for about 5 months now. Arms , shoulders, legs and top part of my chest are bigger and more defined. However my tummy seems to remain soft and has gotten bigger then it's ever been. Which I find odd and confusing. I drink loads of water all day, and two cups of coffee and two protein shakes. Eat pretty healthy, 90% cook my own food. No candy, cakes or shit like that, no alcohol. A ready made pizza once a week. I'm confused as to what's going on! Is it pasta? I often make a big load of pasta veg and chicken to keep in the fridge for a week, for easy access meal. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Cheers
Do you own a shirt!? if yes please throw them away,you dont need them ;)
Jeff please help us out by making a video on vegetarian foods with protein and whether soy is good for male on the grounds of estrogen levels.. i feel like i am stuck and the muscle growth has stopped after a while ..
Eat MOAR chicken,  veggies,  and sweet potatoes And no Twinkies Ding Dongs or fucking ho-hos
The more you eat the more your insulin is raised... that's not a good thing.
would just water boiled noodles with a tiny bit of salt and butter count as crap?
Lol I'm building my body to cosplay JoJos bizarre adventure, I'm very motivated
One of my favorite AthleanX videos. Cut the crap. I just threw out half of a village inn pecan pie..but get rid of my sippy cup too? Damn!
I'd like to know more about the insulin you speak about and how it affects weight loss and also the creatine helps?
Love it!
How often should I be working my abs to see results? Should I be working them every day, or taking breaks like normal workouts looking for gains?
(Hey Jeff this video is to old for you to see this but if someone could reply it would be great) so is drinking flavord water same as drinking normal water or similar cuz I used to be a soda junkie (about 6 days ago) I drank water like once a month(no joke) I just don't like the empty taste of normal water so is it the same
Tips for a Type 1 diabetic?
A six pack of beer once a week isn't going to kill my diet, will it? Honestly thats all I drink now. One night a week, six pack.
Would dieting be okay for a 16 year old?
Can anyone tell me, what could i eat at nights?, right now i eat bread and coffee
Okay so i started working out 4 months ago and was doing only half an hour or maybe an hour workingout and the result was obvious but in a very slowly way  I have a problem with my diet i eat alot of chocolate and sugar sweets even though i stopped eating bread which really improved my health and its the only thing i havnt regret about doing it  So the thing is i need advise from you guys how to make my 6 packs grow faster because i recently kinda doubled working out by cutting break to only 30 sec Besides i need a healthy food program plan please But i love chocolate like i eat it sometimes on daily basis

Hey I know you can't read every comment but I hope you find this you I just want to say thank you I was a fat kid I high school and half way through my senior year I wanted to make a change but I didn't know anything and was to broke to hire a trainer you video and help allowed me to lose over 45 pounds and gain that much muscle all in about 10 months I and no where close to my goals yet and I have had ups and downs with my diet but I am a different person now and it all because of you ! Keep doing what you are doing your changing lives and I hope I have the opportunity to meet you one day
I wanna get fit but school lunch might fuck me up
Can I still eat pizza once a week. The pizza is homemade with actually ingredients not store bought.
wait so are cheat days bad?
Eating more often is kinda hard coz im a fulltime student 😢. #youngdumbandbroke
2:15 LMAO again 11:52 LMAO truth
Great stuff Greg, Keep it coming!!
lol I eat oats raw with milk, is that the healthiest option?
I've done this and at 76 I'm getting stacked.  In addition to working out at the gym every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
So I got what I should be dieting down but to I integrate it I to my exercise as far a sequence goes? Eating before my workout or after, should I be working out between meals that kind of thing.
deck chair off the Titanic LMAO!!
does dominos pizza count as crap if I am thin?
Do you ever have a "cheat meal" or nothing at all?  Love the video!!
Does this apply to females as well?
If I got abs, I’ll never wear shirt again
“If you have to question whether it’s excess, it’s probably excess.” -Jefferson Cavaliere (2015)
eating frequently works against burning fat for a six pack. but intermittent fasting isnt for everybody and if eating frequently makes you eat healthier then def go for it
Am I allowed to eat bacon 🥓
So ....what about the macro...😎😎😎😎
Amen!
Here's an idea...Broke  up with my ex gf, damn best cook ever, and easily could have been a model, but found she was cheating on me. Let's just say, she gave more rides than Greyhound :(_ _ _ Anyway, result? I got fat. Fast forward. Hooked up with my 2nd gf , real ugly(but at least I know she'll be mine and won't cheat on me, you gotta be crazy or desperate to hookup with her ) and the worse cook you'll ever meet.Her cooking is so bad, I pray after I eat. Result? Damn abs starting to show. Problem solved!
This dude is is a savage, "if your sitting there at 30-40% body fat, forget about the supplements at this point, forget about my supplements, I tell you that honestly all the time. It won't matter, at that point it won't matter... its like throwing a deck chair off the titanic." " Fuck the macros, if I have to hear that one more time I'm going to puke." Lol 😂
I eat to much pizza
See the thing is I eat the prepared oatmeal its still good if you eat it for a six pack yes a little bit of sugar but thing is you need a little suger in you're diet.
Thank God. Someone who pronounces often correctly.

What are macros
My mother forces me to eat un-nutritional and unhealthy food as it is "conserving our culture"  when in reality if that culture is slowly killing me I don't friken care!
What for diabetic
I just rock plain oats with a banana
Mommy not gonnna give me a chocolate Sunday dammmm
To myself when I rewatch this video in the future yet again:  How to EAT for ABS:   - Cut the &%$@ food - junk food, fast food, unnecesarily sweet things like cakes, sweets and so on.     - Also kill the cheat days.   - Eat more often. It stabilises the blood sugar. You'll even feel better because of it. Plus overeating gets easier to avoid.   - Eat the healthy versions of the right foods (eat chicken, not chick-mac-nuggets). The pre-made foods usually have put excess salt or sugar in them which @$%#'s up your healthy life style.     - Water is love, water is life (for your muscles). So why drink other stuff.   - Eat even more of the healthy stuff. Your muscles will need it in order to evolve more.   - Use supplements in order to keep up the gains and make it easier to stay on your eating path.     - Even makes it easier to keep the nutritions up when you're travelling and finding the right foods gets hard.     - You can also avoid eating bad parts of some foods just to get the good parts (such as eating steak every day, getting too much saturated fat, just so you can get the creatine in the meat).    - Macros are not the solution. Just these guidelines are.
lol @ christian bale in the machinist
Thank you so much for this video and the other one about the truth about not being able to lose weight.  I had to look myself in the mirror and man up.  Since I've made more consistent meal changes and beverage changes along with supplements and the Fitness Pal app, I've been able to drop inches around my waist and close to 30 lbs in 2&1/2 months with little to no exercise.  I actually enjoy eating now vs dreading and fearing it and being guilted about my choices.  All about finding something that will work long term, not short term.  Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!!!
Love this video! Hey Jeff curious but what's your opinion on protein snacks like cookies the oatmega cookies or like Lenny and larrys or just protein bars and such? I'm curious because I just started working for a supplement place and am really trying to improve my protein and vitamin/mineral habits, and those cookies are so damn good!
I eat 3 meals and I have abs
I just want some recipies, dont know if i spelled that correctly but haha, for less calories and stuff
What about whole grain bread? I eat a piece of Pepperidge Farms' 15 grain bread (toasted) with peanut butter every morning Monday through Friday for breakfast at work and keep hearing conflicting things about whole wheat bread. Thanks!
I got a long horn steak house ad before this
Beautiful vidioe
Thanks
Jeff ate ding dongs
diet has always been my big hold back, look big an buff with a tee on ,just dont ask me to take it off........  gotta get the diet down !!! this is my inspiration, Thanks Jeff!!!!!!!!!!!!
How is this a good step by step diet plan? All he's doing is repeating himself of what NOT to eat.
Not even orange juice??? 🤔
yo jeff the genetic of people can make it harder or easier but those that have a rly big impact ?
Im confused I just tufned 14. I was going to the gym for a year and I went from 72kg to 57kg  I think i was doing something wrong with nutrition. Can you tell me what and how often should i eat bcuz i need to loose weight im 170cm and now im up to 61kg. Should I take any supliments? I take fish oil and mypotein multivitamins and i stopped taking myprotein isolate idk why. Any tips please!
Jeff bought his last shirt in 1996
what about lean cuisine?  or like a tiny bowl of pasta with red sauce?
Every time I go shopping for groceries I always end up walking by sweets on the way to the stuff I usually get. I always look at which ones I'd prefer. But then I start thinking, "Well I Love sugar cookies, but there are like 16 in that box and I certainly don't need 16. Maybe like, just 1 to 3 and only 1 per day at that." So I second guess myself. Like, I find logical ways of saying my body doesn't need that many cookies and I'm not paying like 6 bucks for them just to end up trying to give most of them away. So then I find an alternative. I look at the sweet cake that is sliced up like bread. There are only like 8 slices. But then I'm thinking, "Well those looking good, and there are certainly not 16 of them. But I am not really a big fan of just eating cakey type stuff."  So after all of that, I eventually end up not buying any of it. I just end up forcing myself to look at sweets I used to Love eating all of the time and then find the logic in why I don't need it. Then after looking at how delicious they are only to ignore them and go home and eat like the veggie chips are something, I don't really miss a beat. Once you start aiming to eat healthier, and you get used to it, you eventually come to like eating that food as much as you used to like eating the junk food. Sometimes I find myself at my parent's house and I silently complain that there aren't any of the things I usually eat there. They still have eggs so I am usually satisfied with that. But it's just what happens when you adapt your body to a healthier life style. Once maybe every 3 months I'll eat fast food but you'd be surprised how sick you can feel after you eat it being used to eating non-greasy foods and such.
What a great speech! I've been watching and listening to Cavalière for a couple of weeks and it is amazing how credible and solid information he gives for free in all his videos. After some videos I decided to stop being a party shark to finally achieve the shape I search for years and never reached it. Thanks a lot for the words!
Your the best Jeff! Ty
Great plan started working out during the summer for freshmen year high school, finally abs are starting to show all I eat know is chicken in my salads at lunch time, basically for breakfast bananas peanut butter and milk in shake in the morning, and for dinner some avocado and eggs but most of the time just eggs.
I love how Jeffs body language consists of flexing his pecs when he makes important points
You're probably the realist nutrition and fitness youtuber I've seen. You cut out all the bs and state the real facts which actually helped me get my diet right
Thank you for motivating me. Its the kick in the ass I need to hear.
Deck chair off the Titanic! Haha! Jeff, you are entertaining.  Great video. A rant worth watching.
I'm a girl and Im working on getting a six pack not only guys can get six packs
Can't imagine Jeff without abs tbh
This didn't describe what to eat at all. Just what not to eat
I really like the way this guy presents.  He speaks with honesty and integrity, and inspires you without making you feel shit about yourself.
Well done.
Short summary: 1. Cut crap out of diet 2. Eat more often 3. Substitute more with choice foods, substitute drinks with more water 4. Eat more of good foods 5. Remain consistent
This video is probably the best I've seen saying exactly how it works, keep going man your vids are the best
Im in college... Alcohol is life!!!
so intermittent fasting doesnt work on abs?
fuck the macros 😂
True I  Am  diabetics  My sugary good
Beautifully said... thnx
Good video. Following these five steps, and already seeing drastic improvements. Not just in looks but everyday feeling good and health.
Ryan hachet must be skinny asf
And if you really want some good protein have a jack link jurkey only 10g of protein...... EDIT: per package
Definitely helped me out...I've been making changes here and there but I realize I need to make some SERIOUS moves if I wanna get myself in order. Thanks, Jeff!
Why have a six pack when you can have the whole keg
You said F macros.. but people who count macros are also ripped and buff af.. so who do i believe.?
Hey Jeff,  what about drinking fresh juice without sugar Or  What about natural sugarcane juice ?
On the thumbnail jeffs pecs were uneven
Ding dongs for lunch...hmm..
901 jealous bitches wishing they had his abs
Lol the pic of the guy is hilarious
Please be my trainer 😭I trust you lol amazing 🙌🏼I'm not fat but my abs need this 💟
@athlean-x is it ok to have blended frozen bananas or strawberries as an ice cream substitute at night? I don't add anything else to it.. for some reason I just can't get past the longing for something cold and creamy at night. Also, are cashews okay to eat daily? I have a lot of weight to lose but have a gluten allergy, so I'm very limited ..
i am 16 years old and i am skinny and i have a week training but should i do diet?? i dont want to lower my weight
are you allowed 1 treat day a week ?
Of course only drinking water is best, but I notice a lot of people in Germany do something interesting. It might also be common elsewhere, but they fill half their cup with juice and then fill the rest with water.
I have just seen this now but I have been working out for almost 7 weeks now. I have lost 11 pounds and have slowly develop muscles at the chest and upper limb area. but still covered in fat. I started from 213lbs then now I'm at 212lbs. I did follow step 1 and about the water step but not in the max. I have replace my meals from Rice into whole wheat. probably I ate more than 3000 calories a day and I drop it to 1500 calories a day by just eating whole wheat. but sometimes probably twice or thrice a week I eat rice or consume high sugar foods.   I will follow this diet plan more strictly. I want to be the best that I can be
Loved it.  Needed to hear it.  Thank you.
Is he Italian?
Honestly, hes right. Its SUUUUPER HARD to get rippes by JUST eating right cause it cost a lot of money (ironically unhealthy food is super cheap) ive bern eating well for years and working out hard and my six pack isnt nowhere near hes suplements are a natural way to give ur body the extra help it will need (xept herbalife that shit bounces u back in no time if u ever stop taking it)
Flavor enhancers for water have helped me a lot.
Looking at his arms make my arms hurt...
It's easy. If you buy something and you don't know what the ingredients are, don't eat it, especially if you can't even pronounce it.
The man speaks the truth.
is eating spicy food good or bad
im a fucking genius.
can using supplements be like steroids I really need to know this answer so please someone with the answer enlighten me
I lost it when I heard the filter 😂 F**k the macros ✊️✊️✊️
Hey, so I am a camp counselor who works on camp sites with kids all year round, which means I'm very sporty and always active, however I'm "skinny fat" and I workout, I've built muscle but I can't control my diet or monitor carbs because of always eating Camp food and not knowing what's in it. How can I lose my extra flab on my tummy and have low body fat ?
What about fasting? I only eat 2-3 meals a day. I break my fast with a good meal, pre workout "snack"/"meal",  post workout biggest meal. Good or not?
I'm on it
Lost 20 lbs in 5 months by small caloric defecit in my diet.
Realest shit ever
I lost 70 pounds in 5 months by only exercising,  drinking a lot of water, and eating healthy! It's hard but at the end is worth it
pls add subtitles

ahh shit my sandwich is over here
get rid of your sippy cups
People don't like to listen to people who have the truth because it hurts them.
sir after abs workout what we should eat and drink
Jeff, I appreciate your delivery- if our clients won't do the little things, they won't do the big things.  Yes, we KNOW our bad habits and need to take care of that instead of looking a magical fix. Thanks for making a stand and reminding all of us what we need to hear.
Fucking love your videos, no bullshit, just the plain and simple hard truth. You're awesome man!!
am 1.73m and 64 kg and my body still contain a lot of fat !!
I love you man I can actually rely on you
Nearly had a heart attack when he showed the first board and thought it meant cut the carb
Love your videos Jeff!!!!! Do see a speech coach at some point, it 'll up your youtube game like you wouldn't imagine. You need to breath man, release all that tension in your throat.
Well what about fasting. I eat at 12-2 pm and then at 8 and thats it
And on top of that..........say no to GMO's!
Started at May 28, 2017 85.8 KG It's July 8th, 2017 and i'm down to 77.4 KG I was a KFC addict and shit before that... But as I started my change, I chose some of my favorite dishes (Grilled chicken breast with garlic sauce and some rice, Ground beef with some sweet potatoes) and I kept eating the same shit I loved as long as it was healthy until now. The results are great. And all changes that I did was only what was mentioned in this video. I never had knowledge/tips and tricks about a proper nutrition before watching this video, so like Jeff said, don't get confused by the simplicity of this. This video is the juice.
I've been around many fitness channels and this one is straight forward and full of value
Bro who else is 13-15😂😂
I am sorry to say this, I would so much like to learn from his knowledge, but he just talks too much and it takes too long for him to get to the point. I would be able to learn more from a little more concrete tips, instead of ' replace the less obvious stuff that is not so good for you with stuff that is good for you'. I just can't get myself interested to hear the whole video cause its just so boring.
fuck the macros
My nigga you look like Brandon McCarthy
Thanks Jeff for being truthful. Ignore the negative comments from the haters of the truth.
how big are jeffs arms?
should i be full when im done eating ? even if im eating healthy
Drinking too much water gave me RLS 😑
Truth. Speak it brah!
if someone noticed jeff repeated 3 points in a different manner lol :D
"If you have to question if its excess then its probably excess"...lol welp,  l gotta let that tequila and even the lovely michelob light beer alone if l wanna see real fatloss cuz l should be farther along than what l am.
He got my attention when he says "No Macros" here.
what if i wake up at 7:30 go to the gym. and of course warm up and work on for example  chest. for muscle. and go back at 6:30 and do cardio and a little bit of abs. does that work??? or should i switch it up
Just eat chicken and vegetables guys.
let me save all of you 13 minutes. Eat clean and healthy. great fucking diet advice.
how about squash? it's mostly water i just drink it every other time i fill my water bottle for a different taste.
Awesome channel.
Getting my eating in order is killing me
So glad you say fuck macros! I hate all that macro counting bullshit!
First step: *mission failed, we'll get em next time*
I want to buy106$ but I don't wanna pay the shipping!!!! The shipping is more than half the price to Australia
Possibly the best video I've seen yet. No nonsense great advice!!
my friend eats nothing but chocolate and weights like 120 pounds i freaking hate people with a fast matabolizm
this is really difficult because i cant make my own food
"FCK THE MACROS GUYS!!!" 😂😂😂 fckn SAVAGE
I give myself too many excuses, I always think I'm fine I'll work it of tomorrow (the crap) but it's proven me wrong I'm not seeing results I'm going to cut the crap I've had enough thank you needed this boost 😻
jeff has made so many gains. look at this vs. his most recent. oml
What is your opinion in fasting?
why is this guy saying the same thing over and over
So do you share your meal plan?
I miss junk food.
are fat burning pills ok to take.
Cheat days not good?
fun fact drinking juice make you more thirsty.
I gotta stop ordering 2 number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7,  2 number 45s - one with cheese, and a large soda everyday then.
Muscle Building foods : Bananas + Apple milk shake in low fat milk.  Spinach .  Brocoli.  Different types of lentils.  Chicken.    Red meat as beef .  Low fat yogurt.  Sweet Potatoes.  oatmeal.  Egg Whites.  Beans.  Brown Rice.
yes man yes
Wish I could afford this right now, I think you sound honest enough...already purchased this vshred thing...and not even sure if it's worth it...
the sound good
"like throwing a deck chair off the titanic" "haha
This guy is amazing. Truly a role model for young men like myself
Is 1-2 beers a day going to severely or even moderately impact by ability to generate results? I eat very healthy, can't stand junk food, but I just love beer so much (I'm sort of a connoisseur).
great motivation here... only 2 weeks into throwing exercise back into my life.  literally needed.  thanks
Greg from Kinobody would not agree with this..
I have a six pack, it's just in the cooler.
of course I find this after I eat about 1000 calories worth of pizza
Who is watching while eating candy?
my problem is I'm a very fussy eater so what would what should I do
great video, thanks
funny Eat more often lol we now know Intermittent fasting is the way to go lol
Thank you very very very much for all of your good advices!!! You are an inspiration!!!
Fuck the macros 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Savage
Want six pack in less than a year ? Go raw vegan it not only gets you a six pack... but educates you about life eat greens to stay leans 🥒🍆🥕🍎🍎🍠🌶
I like how he keeps a skelton in the background to make him look more proffessional! jaja good tips tho i love the first one
through this entire video I was saying please let us be able to eat ramen
What kind of healthy foods do you guys recommend? I wanna start to eat healthy any tips will work.
Holup, aren't I supposed to eat a lot more since I'm *extremely* skinny as in *ectomorph* skinny? I don't feel like I should be cutting out foods, can someone help out?
eat frequently but eat what? what kind of food?
We grow up with your advices in Musclemag magazine ! thanks a lot !
thanks
Using this abs guide “suza great plan” (Google it) helped me get 6 pack abs. Having 6-pack abs is a lot easier if you`re in good physical shape and you make use of some of the guide’s special techniques. Which will provide you nice look and from that look you might get some self confidence. Apart from this there`s no relation between six-pack abs and your over-all mental and physical well being.
You've Got Some Of The Best Traps I've Ever Seen!
I really try to give him a chance and they are so informative but i cant just listen to a guy just talking to me for 13 minutes. Doesnt hold my attention. He needs to do a voice over of him demonstrating, working out, showing information, etc. I know not all feel this way but just a helpful critique that would help his videos.
is this going to ruin my muscle gains?
Know this was posted awhile ago but had a hydration question. I put my amino acids in my water to promote myself drinking more water throughout the day. thought? they are flavored but 0 sugar.
This guy is great but his problem is his theory is more then his practical..
So you keep saying that we shouldn't eat junk food and  there's healthy replacements, but if i need 2,500 calories a day and i do only, maybe i don't know some junk food all day that's 2000 calories. I would lose weight, but does it screw something else, if i just don't surpass those calories does that mean i can eat what i want as soon as i don't pas the 2,500? Asking cause you clearly disagree.  Love your videos!
I legit feel like your arm muscles are gonna explode
PLEASE:  FRUIT SUGAR VS SUGAR VIDEO
very useful, as always, but a little more because rant.
i used to think that just cutting calories would get me abs, never worked once
GREAT advice! Jeff RULES!!!!!
aye y'all is syrup good to use???
What about tea? Can you drink tea in your diet?
Can you replace a meal with say a protein bar or protein shake. I only ask cause I do not have the option of getting 5 meals a day
Instructions weren't clear....I put the steroids in my anus.
Athlean x AKA the TRUTH 🙌🙌🙌🙌
TFW you realise the bricks are just wallpaper.
thanks bro i needed to hear that it stung a little but i needed it. ive put on about 30 pounds of muscle but ive also put on too much fat. ive got love handles and a bit of a gut and its depressing
What if I make my own juice with fresh fruits is that ok?
Hey! Can I do weight training in the morning and do your 22 day ab workout in the evening or night? I am on heavy gaining. I have already gained 10 pounds in 4 weeks. Most of it is muscle with minimum belly fat. But now I would like work on my abs. Please suggest.
haha fuck the macros I love this guy he spits truth
best bodybuilding channel ever
nutrition supplements are costly,isn't is any other way to replace them with anything?
This should be mainstreamed on TV, period.
Ciao signori
It states nothing about diet plan MEALS just the basics saying you should eat clean af n stay eating clean af soooooo
The only sugar i take is the one i put in my tea, should i eliminate it? are there natural sugars i should take instead? like in fruits or anything?
Is eating nuts good or bad for abs? cuz i know it's protein but its also a lot of fat if i look at the label...
Hey, keep this up man, something I really needed to hear
with all the crazy Health diets out here is there a book that you would recommend on foods and how to cook and what to eat
Good stuff!!
Sweet potato, whole wheat foods, fish, and spinach and non-processed veg work wanders :)
so. you dont endorse flexible dieting ?
I'm new to this whole body building stuff. What does he mean by "fuck the macro's"? What exactly is the macros?
What's the truth on beef jerkey, good or bad?
That fourth phase was so true I could hug ya jeff lol
B:oatmeal, Greek yogurt, protein bar. L: oven baked chicken and lots of veggies. pre/during workour:protein 2 servings over an hour and half. after work out:1 serving protein. dinner: salad and something tasty with good protein.  before bed. cottage cheese. once a week I go in on a meal of my choice. I always drink water, at least a gallon a day. I started working out 7 weeks ago after a couple months off. I was down to a 135lb bench struggling. hit 225 with pause on chest and a raise with no assistance on De racking the bar or during the motions. stay dedicated! listen to this guy. be smart, stay away from extra sugar. The end.
I just had my ass kicked! Bye bye chocolate and beer - till the weekend, I can have a beer at the weekend right? Please?
You hit the nail on the head!! Thank you
.... I was wondering ABOUT me AND sweating, is it good for you to sweat??
0:01 seconds in the video and I'm already  fucked
if you have to question if it's excess, it's probably excess.   That's one of the best advice I've heard. For me it's sweets :/
Good rant!
Spot on! This is exactly how I finally got,the abs I've been searching for for,years, literally JUST LIKE JEFF SAYS. THIS EXACT PROCESS.
I've been following my macros for awhile (a kitogenic diet) and using myfitnesspal to track my calories. And I also do intermittent fasting. But I have my diet is set to two meals a day. I'll change it to three as you suggested (while still following my diet). Maybe the abs will come out then.
Very good sound advice. Thanks man
Alcohol- if you have to question whether it's excess, it's probably excess.
Ramadan is a good occasion for the intermittent'ish fasting diet and even to cut the last crappy food i'm still eating then back to a more frequent calorie intakes with good nutritient and just enough cals to support muscle growth. Or so i hope wish me luck with the consistency thing 😆
Cool abs
Hi Guys, i was a very skinny kid when i was younger and malnourished. now im 36, and weight 169lbs, yet i can only lift about 38kg/s (84lbs) max (3 sets of 8). in bench press with proper technique. 12.5kgs (27.5lbs) 3 sets of 8 in dumbell shoulder press, i only barbell curl 16.5kg's (37lbs) in 3 sets of 12, and bar pulldown curls for triceps at 18.5kg's (41lbs) in 3 sets of 10-12.  im one of th weakest people i've ever known for my size/weight. i have long skinny arms, badly designed and weak shoulders (i can't do straight arm dumbell lifts out to the side for my shoulders as it feels like my rotatot cuffs are breaking/ytearing, even with VERY low weight, i can't put alot of pressure on my rotatot cuffs at all, feels like they're damaged previously( I've been avoiding things that put alot of press on the shoulder joint as i don't wanna hurt them again like i did last time).  IM LITERALLY the weakest human being on earth for my size and weight. Should i be lifting heavier than what i am? I've previously got to gym and was eating decent for a year a couple of years ago and my weights did go up, but i never got above like 48kgs (106lbs) on my barbell bench.  my BIGGEST problem is, i think i have some problm with my back, as from the side, my shoulder and upper back area are as thin as a guy with 30lbs less weight than me, but then my chest cavity (ribcage) is very big i'd say compared to is. so from the side, my chest looks quite big, but then my delts and back from the side are tiny ion comparison. and my neck is very thin and short, and i notice unlike most other people, that even when i push my shoulders down as far as they can go, i can't get my collalr bone / clavicals t line up straight, and standing normally, there's quite a V there in their shape. meaning with a short neck, and and my shoulders closer to my head (fairly broad shoulder also) my collar bones in a V shapoe to eachother, it lookds very thin, boring, unsightly etc to have literally no shoulders definition. i can see even after a few weeks of training again, my triceps which have always been the biggest and straongest looking part of my arm, are getting bigger again, but my shoulder just isn't developing again. I've been doing firemens carries with my shoulders held up towards my ears with 20kg (45lb) dumbells, i've been doing shoulder shrugs with same, i've been doing cable face pulls with the tricep pulldown rope /double ended ball rope thing, like liftring the pivot up to my head height, and leaning back slightly and pulling the ropes to my nose with flaired elbows and i can feel it working my delts. ietc, but they just don't seem to be progressing at all. any tips?   And other tips of what you've read here also would be appreciated. ty
how do you get more vascular?
bad food is bad . good food is good . more water less drinks . got it 😎🔥👍
should i try to get my protiens high?
The simple honest truth right here.
Throw my food I bought ok that was 7 monthes a go I on ly got a 9 pack
JEFF! I'd really appreciate it if you answered me back.   My daily life is difficult for a diet. At least to me. I'll explain why.  I'm handicapped, I live at home with mom and dad and at 23 years old, I sadly don't have a job. As such, I really have no choice about what food we eat, even though I've brought it up multiple times. They are not supportive of a cleaner diet and always give me excuses as to why they don't buy fresh veggies or leaner meats. A lot of our veggies we eat are canned, and I have no idea as to if these are any different.  Moreover, we don't have the '3 meals a day' schedule. It's if and when we have food in the house to make a meal, such as red meats mainly, and whenever someone feels like cooking. Most of the time, it's just random crap in cans lying around or absolute junk bought to fill in the huge space of time before dinner, where its basically 'eat what you can', such as ramen products or processed meats like bologna. For example, tonight we had a huge cookout. Burgers, brats, and smoked grillers. Throughout the day up until that point, there was nothing of substance to eat multiple times.  There are usually eggs to eat in the house, which we either scramble or fry in butter, and breakfast almost always consists of eggs in some form. Could I have eaten eggs multiple times? Or just popped the top on a can of corn or some sweet potatoes and ate them by themselves? I honestly don't know, if I can somehow make the most of what I've got till I find a job, I'm willing.  Would love to lose weight and get healthy. I've been a subscriber of yours for a while and know you speak the truth. Keep killing it man.
My cousin introduced me into the weight loss plan called “sowo hope site” (Google it). Inside almost no time, I decreased 12 pounds. This diet works for everybody. Google it to learn more.
FUCK THE MACROS GUYS
If you eat six small meals throughout the day instead of three big ones it boosts your metabolism.
question i have about drinking water, i stoped drinking milk, soda, juice and all other stuff then water, but i drink like 1/2-1 liter of water a day. How can i get more water in to my system? Like i know i should drink more water but is there any rutin i should add in to my life? please someone?
the thing "eat more frequently", like for breafast i have oatmeal with an orange and some sesame seeds and it keeps my blood sugar stabilized during the first 5 hours a day and im not hungry either, like should i eat something inbetween my breakfast and lunch? and i usely just have like a fruit inbetween lunch and dinner. so my question is, should i eat more inbetween my meals?
Going to the pool or creek and WILL NOT take off your t-shirt to go swim with them because you hate how you belly looks.
Or you can take clebeutral with Xenical and T3 and you will get it in no time.
truth
Great tips! Thanks a lot man
If you want to get 6 pack abs then you should try this abs guide “suza great plan” (Google it). Simply speaking, if you want to look wonderful (and I am sure, feel great also!) get this book. I have only begun to implement the wisdom within and yes, there is some work involved.
I'm fit but I still can't get that cut look on my lower abs. The rest of my body is toned. it might be IBS causing this... any tips? Thx!
how long you have to work out when you have one day how many Sex and how long does it take to get your system
I used this abs guide “suza great plan” (Google it) and achieved a 6-pack abs. Men envy my toned abs as I exercise at a fitness center. According to my coach, this guide works well more both genders. Give it a shot to have the result that I have achieved.

Too bad half of you won't change
QUESTION !!  Where I can find NATURAL supplements to Recruit, Rebuild and Recover ?! NEED YOUR ADVICE  I understand totally about supplements, actually I didn't take supplement and I will not. I will go on world tour and I don't want to keep with me supplements. I can't have a lot of things in my bag. Thank you so much 🙏🏻
Amazing toe like always 👌🏻
MAN, YOU ARE THE BEST!!! Love how you ended the rant with "F#CK THE MACROS!...." BRILLIANT! Finally someone real!

Jeff, do you have any success stories of diabetic clients on your meal plans and training? If so can you post some?
What about water with sf crystal light added to it? Is that a substitute for water also?
Is Naked juice OK to drink?
Supplements are expensive.
So do you not count macros?
Yes, FUCK the macros!
I just embarked upon the best diet known to man.. high fat low carb it's got monster results I do it with intermittent fasting, I now steam 💨 🚂 train in the morning when my growth hormone is @2000% increase then start eating all day than stop @ 🕗
Your the best dude!!!!!
Wait wait wait... no fit tea ? No bs supplements ? Haha.   Great channel! The better on YouTube! No bs ! Only real dry facts that really works !   Like it
Question: will dieting for a six pack affect the growth of your other muscle groups?
F**K the macros!    lmao
Everytime i work my abs my back hurts. I know i need to strengthen my back, but even so it doesnt seem to matter. Its been like this about 2 out  of the 4 years ive been lifting.
OMG even after all this time, he always gets me with the "F*@ck the macros! LOLOOOOOOO     so true do

i'm too lazy to cook anything more complex than soup and Im too poor to pay someone else for my grilled chicken, that's the stuff I need to change. mostly the kitchen aversion :(
I acquired 6-pack following this abs guide “suza great plan” (Google it). Men envy my toned abs as I exercise at the gym. According to my trainer, this guide is effective more both genders. If you want the result like me, try it yourself.
what about V-8 Juice?
"if you have to question if it's excess alcohol then it's probably excess"
I'm sat here eating junk food within large in-frequent meals and getting leaner by the day 👍 it's just calories in, calories out folks. But don't forget your micronutrients for general health
always keeping it real...
what about drinking milk is that a good thing to be drinking or not
Overal this abs guidel “suza great plan” (Google it) is a superb guide and a must have for anybody who wants Six pack abs.

Nice this is so true , thanks for your honesty I appreciate it ... I need to stop the bs. If I ever gonna change my fat belly.. Thanks

how can i eat healthy on a budget also only have georgeforman grill and micorave please reply jim from California

Thanks Jeff
"FUCK the macros!" My favorite thing you've ever said!
for me this is what is working great so far, 5 kg in 1 month gone  - really working my ass off in gym 6 days a week, with progressiveness in strength and technique - following his channel whenever i am in doubt !! - sleeping 8 hours !
Damn got grilled!!!!
10:45 " its like throwing a deck chair off the titanic" that's a Jeff classic!
for me it's hard, because i want to eat mote healthier but everyone in my house buys nothing but junk. and i get extremely tempted and don't know What to do.
I'm heavily inspired by the knowledge you provide sir.. Thank you 😊
This was fantastic...thanks for the truth!
"you did something good, mummy gave you a chocolate sundae". funniest think iv'e heard all week.
Just opened a bag of chips , (not kidding) while watching this video... lol
Gotta love the discipline and reality he demonstrates in his videos. As well as the humor, "F*ck the macros!", "it's like throwing a deck chair off the titanic", "if you have to think about if it's excess, it's probably excess". Great vids, Great knowledge, no BS, he has my subscription!
anyone around to help with managing my diet, i have a chaotic working schedule. :D TY
Sooo... I guess Dq is out of the question 😒
You're making it seem like you can't eat any fast food or sugary snacks at all. If you have a six pack or are trying to get one, a six piece nugget from mcdonalds or a bowl of ice cream isn't gonna destroy your progress. Now I'm not saying go and eat that stuff all the time, but it won't destroy you're abs if you only have it occasionally.
I know what what it is that I'm eating that's keeping me fat and flabby. Thanks for this gut check Jeff. I'm going to cut the crap out and start working out in the morning before work and at lunch for 10 or 15 minutes. I'm done with unhealthy living.
all I eat is salad and chicken nigga 24/7
can i have honey nut cheerios for breakfast still
your god damn right bro, thank you

How about carbs protien and fat intake? Sould carbs be low as possible?

Is bread bad
snowballs?
Personally I found phase 3 to be the most important. To iteratively go over your eating habits and make slight improvements as you go. That way it's already a habit, but with a slight tweak. Like coffee with 2 sugars, but once a week you just reduce it by 20% until eventually you don't have sugar.  2 years later, I now eat like Jeff and don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.
legit
what are some healthier ways to prepare chicken? i usually bake boneless skinless chicken breasts.  how much salt should I use? should I use any seasonings at all? what SHOULDN'T i season my chicken breast with?

You have really funny expressions when I hit pause while you're talking. You are very informative, love your stuff, butt in so tired it's hilarious. Try it yourself.
Jeff cavalier is the only real fitness badass on YouTube.  Period.
how can an american talk so much sense
My main issue is that I'm never sure if I should be eating for gaining muscle or cutting fat (although as I wrote that I'm realizing they aren't exclusive). I'm 5'6 and  around 135 and I workout or do something physical everyday. I have some belly fat that I'm trying to get rid of. But I'm also trying to gain weight. Should I just be eating more of the healthy stuff? I mostly stay away from carbs except for beans, but maybe I should add oatmeal. I also waver between drinking whole milk or not.
chuck Norris has his own diet plan for six packs
Starting........  NOW

I was a little fat in the stomach not much but since I'm doing it I see 3/6 abs almost 4 !! lower abs are a pain in the ass to get tho !!

Thank you Jeff! I'm 18yrs old and you motivate me to keep trying. And find different routes to take so I can reach my goals. Every little detail you say helps!
Love it. It's like free therapy. You remind me that the only thing holding me back,  is myself.
Coming from a diabetic. This is perfect👌👌👌👌
What would Jeff do! The man!
bro thank you
Fuck yeah man. Your realness is highly motivational
Thanks  Jeff,  Valuable  tips and instructions on how to get 6-pack abs!
damnnnnn no frie chicken no soda? fuck six pak...
I would be able to focus on the words better if you were wearing a shirt
What are good foods to buy if you can't afford to buy the expensive healthy food that you can eat daily? Especially since I am under 18 and my parents buy the food
man...fuck those macros.
When he said "fuck the macros" I lost it 😂😂😂 he's amazing though
You don't tell us shit
This is sound advice, it shouldn't be a 'diet' just a lifestyle and small gradual changes will get you there. Although he covered it with the 'crap' you shouldnt be eating he didn't actually mention alcohol. When it comes to abs, alcohol is not your friend.
You should make a snapchat account showing quick workout videos and meals
hello sir... I am from India and many Indian follow you. will you make some videos in Hindi or with hindi titles.
hi Thanks for these. I just wondered. stay away from juice etc! but is Coconut water OK to drink 500-1000 ml per day in humid climates.?
Is it good to drink gatorade after a workout, I drink water throughout the entire day. Is once or twice a week good or should it be less frequent?
what about green tea
What scissors should I buy for step one?
Love this guy. No nonsense, no bullshit. just straight facts and truths.
i think i looked at his face only three time in the video. No homo but you got a gud body.
i was watching this as i was pigging on pizza and fries. i promise this is the last crap i eat for the rest of the month.
Eat more frequently - how does this compare to intermittent fasting ?  Can you eat more frequently within a 8 hour window ?
"Fuck the macros". I want to get this on a t-shirt. Or maybe a sleeveless top...
What do I eat? Morning dinner??
Legend!!
man,one of the rare channel that doesn't waste second to tell how much he will save everyone but instead he simply start it  PREACH!
This dude gives out million dollar advice for free. Aka diet plans? Love it
Is taking in supplements that you can't get of by eating food natural? like taking creatine? cause you can't get it from eating enough meat.
Far better than a chocolate cake LOOL #RealTalk
Love this guys, ''No bullshit", attitude.
What's best to eat before the workout ?
Good video
This guy is a no thrills straight to the point type person. I like it..years of experience, research, and hard work that he's sharing to better all of us and I damn sure appreciate it man. About to get in the best shape of my life by following your program.
Any suggestions for supplements for a junior in highschool? (I weigh about 140 and am pretty muscular (like get compliments occasionally), also I work out on 3 day on 1 day off schedule)
Thanks Jeff, i have a cruise in April and have been wanting abs for it. I work out religiously, and my dad has been telling me you get abs from what you eat and doing ab exercises daily. I eat pretty healthy but could change somethings (like school lunch prob should get salads, which i have before). The step about eating more often is very helpful (so that eat smaller meals), thanks.(pretty fit rn like i get compliments that im muscular). Also im most likely gonna go get some supplements like creatine. Any suggestions? Thanks wish me luck 😁 (just letting you know: i can flex abs to show "six pack" rn but i want one where dont have to flex).
So.... No more candy? 😭
Hey! Can you please do a follow up video with examples of food from each category? Much appreciated
Is beer good??
Jeff Cavaliere's 3 step guide to get abs.  Step 1: Take off your shirt  Step 2: Throw your shirt  away along with all your other shirts in the closet  Step 3: Burn down the shirt store down the street.   Success: Now you have abs!   Love your videos, they are keeping me alive after breaking up with my ex after 4 years. Advice to anyone after a break up. Use your depression and loss in appetite as a benefit to diet and workout. It works wonders!
Great video!   Great info,  Thank you for always having a straight forward no BS approach.   Would love to hear your thoughts on carbs!
Last time I tried dieting I almost became hypoglycemic. How do I watch my foods but also take in enough sugars?
CUT OUT SODA!! That shit is horrible for you. I know it tastes really good,but if you cut nothing else out,make sure you cut that crap out.
1. Cut the crap 2.Eat more often 3. Eat less of the less obvious foods by swapping in the good 4. Eat more of the good stuff 5.Supplement for consistency  You're welcome.
fuck the macros man!,,, lol
Another positive thing that Jeff doesn't mention is that your sense of taste gets re-sensitized to real food, meaning you'll actually enjoy things that aren't reese cups and glazed donuts.  And if you have a cheat once in a while, and actually eat one of those, it'll basically make you blow your load.
Jeff, just want to say i love your videos. And i would like to ask you, which is better, amino acid tablet or creatine? Im a bit newbie at this stuff.
F**k macros! Hallelujah, finally someone I trust said it.
i can't eat Sunday's or most junk food as I'm allergic to dairy, I just have problems with what I should eat... I like steal cut quick oats myself, Irish oats I think...
i look forward to the rant videos don't apologize Jeff
Step 2 contradicts Intermittent Fasting - Thomas Delaur, Hodgetwins you name it
This guy is the real deal. He has no angle, not trying to throw crap at us, just being honest about fitness. I love it.
This guy is one of the most authentic trainers i've ever come across. Cheers to him!
I eat a good amount of fruit daily. Do I need to cut it out?
11:09 - 11:33 Jeff breaks down happiness beautifully. so true when you start seeing results after hard work.. I try to think about this every time there's sweets sitting in front of me
Look fockers... when he says eat more often he knows that if u binge eat food in one sitting, your body doesnt know whether or not you're gonna get more food so it turns the access calories into fat to store for later, if you eat often there is no extra calories to store as fat, thus your body uses the few calories it got and no calories are stored as fat
Fuck the macros  FUCKING DYING
0:50-0:55 his right bicep
is 20 percent sugars a lot  I need guidance on sugars percentage. I dont know anything
What is your opinion on diet/aspartame sweetened drinks?

im eating pizza whilst watching this
Is chipotle good enough? I don't know if a chicken burrito counts as crap
I have personally been dropping weight like never before, applying the weight loss plan “lyly amazing guide” (Google it). It’s been the most efficient plan I’ve ever implemented. Merely Google "lyly amazing guide" and read all the information.
I eat once a day and keto have an 8 pack, step 2 is relative to your diet

How do you think guys like Flex Wheeler who have kidney problems should approach their diets and workouts, particularly since high amounts of protein is not allowed for kidney transplant patients?
If you have to question excess , it's probably excess lol
Solid diet plan while giving us the flexibility to use our brains and work with our own bodies. Because we know ourselves and our bodies better than we think we do. Thanks.
Hey very informative video, thank you for enlightening us. I do have some questions regarding cardio. I am working with high intensity, namely weight training. But I completely eliminated cardio. I am making gains, by working 5 to 6 days a week. But bellyfat is a BIG problem for me. I have a 42" wait. I would like to go down to a 34", but I am afraid if I do cardio, I will lose any gains that I have made. I really would like (like everybody else, it would seem), to get abs six pack. I am confused about how much cardio should I do, and you correctly pointed 90% of my problem it seems is nutrition. What time should I stop eating, before I go to sleep? Can you or someone help? Thanks
what about coffee
exactly what im doing , i got a body building show coming up , good tips and i want to become a personal trainer , whats the best way to get certified or the best route , any advise ?
BROCCOLI!!! CARROTS!!!!! POTATOES!!!!! GAAAAAAAAAAA
Awesome video Jeff I recently broke 4 ribs and gained 15 lbs of fucking jelly. Well on my way to recovery but I still can't exercise that well without a lot of pain. Thanks for the pep talk. Gonna bust it out when I need a boost.
am 15. so does this all go for my age to or just older
Love his genuine content! Keeping it real!
Confused because he has the most click bait titles yet actually provides good information 😂
I loss 145 lb just watching ,listening and doing what he is telling us to do thanks Jeff
I am 15 and i weight 122 pounds, i do 200 - 250 pushups a day and i cant get a bigger chest, what am i doing wrong can anyone help ?
1 year after the Machinist Christian Bale looked fantastic as the Dark Knight in Batman begins.
That was very helpful thanks but is it alright to have cheat days
FUCK THE MACROS! lmao YES!
A ripped body requires 1,500 sodium diet...My sodium diet was easily OVER 9000!!!JP😜But seriously it was well over 2,500 Which is the average limit to how much you Should eat per day...My everyday sodium diet involved: Grits-330 Canned Corn-320 Canned greens beans-320 White rice-310 Hot sauce-200 noodles-810 White bread-250 Mac and Cheese-970 I haven't even added meat nor soda on this list yet and already I'm at a whopping 3,510 grams of sodium in 1 day...VERY BAD😱24,570 grams of sodium a week when it really should be at least 10,500 per week(Which is healthy as hell)...
What if I'm not thinking about the macros! How do I know I'm not getting enough protein to build muscle, or enough carbs to fuel the workouts. I'm often confused when you say not to worry about portion size or macro, but then we still have to be coming in at a caloric deficit how are we supposed to know for in a caloric deficit if we're not aware of our calories?
I keep getting migranes whenever I don't eat any sugar.  I've been working out a while but got stuck in a bulking phrase and I just hate the migranes whenever I cut out the sugar😭😭
Jeff is not the trainer we wanted.. He's the trainer we needed
People are mislead about diet. Humans are naturally designed to be vegan. You will perform better if you go vegan. Ask Frank Medrano, Nimai Delgado, John Venus and many other vegan body builders. If you are in doubt just look at nature, nature doesn't lie. A gorilla is vegan and are extremely powerful. All predatory animals typically are successful killing the young, old or sick vegan preys. We've been tricked to breastfeed from a cow as adults. Humans are the only species that washes, freezes, cooks and seasons flesh. Plants are loaded with protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals and little to no fat.
Fuck the macros!
"Cut excess alcohol. If you have to question whether it's excess, it's probably excess." lmao he killed me
I am a beginner and I don't know what "crap" is it that your talking about? Secondly, how should I make my diet plan? Thirdly, what is good food?
I think the more calories you start to burn (the more often you start doing sports, running or training), you could still be able to reach the 6 packs, for sure all bad food should be avoided, but not at all cost. Will see if this would work after some time :)
"Fuck the macros" right on brother.
I starting train myself like may 2016 and train like a dog every day..Cardio based.Lost 5kg and starting to see my adonis muscles..In september 2016 when i checked  myself i starting to be mad cause never saw fucking abs...And Findout jeff on youtube after september i starting to do what he said stop eating junk food,his abs workouts etc..Now i have 12%body fat and i can see my abs like monster!I love when he said "fuck the macros!" thats all true..Fuck it!Do what he said and starting to care about yourself!!Trust me every morning when i look myself on mirror my day allways starting awesome!
"It's like throwing a deck chair off the Titanic" - Brutally honest, I love it.
This is not too this posting but I wanna know how do you know when too do different exercises that work out the same muscle's there are many ways too do the same thing how do you do the rotating of the exercises..
I'm  just not sure when and what to eat and what not to eat
"*beep* macros" This is why I subscribed.
It has been about a month since I've changed my diet like Jeff described, but, not to be gross, is a side effect of the change to have mass amounts of gas? At first, it was funny but now it is just annoying. Has anyone else experienced this and will it go away? This is an honest question.
I eat as clean as possible  I lift weights 3 times a week  I train jiujitsu 5 days a week  Judo 2 times a week  Must Thai 2 times a week  And I still can't get abs! What in the world am I doing wrong
Im always eat peanut is that bad for build sixpack because im doing elliot hulse diet im cut off all gluten drink only water and eliminate all starchy carbo
F*ck the macros baby! Cut the crap!
Jeff whats your  daily breakfast, lunch, and dinner ?  And how often can we afford to give ourselves a "cheat" day?
is curry healthy ?
Thank you for this! You are inspiring!
Golden info there
Here are some things you shouldn't consume if you want to be ripped. Added sugar, dairy bread, cold cuts red meat. Cutting sugar was the hardest but most important
I drink 4l of water a day. About 100g of protein a day. Whole foods, proteins, and vegetables. Go to the gym and workout intensely 4-6 days per week. But I can't not drink alcohol.
4:40 I thought he said "I started to eat opium more often". I was like "WHAT THE FUCK!"
Why is he always topless
I drink at least 6 ltrs  of water max is 8 ltrs thnx mate
try committing to drinking a gallon of water a day for a week, and no other beverages, just for a week and see how good you feel!
Jeff yelling at me to "cut the crap" drove me into a deep, dark depression and caused me to binge eat McDonald's and oreo cookies.
Thank you for the tips!
just eat like 90% clean and allow yourself a bit of the worse stuff.
Jeff is my dad 😂😂
If you have to question if its excess, its probably excess lol
I really did not trust on any "web expert&famous"  especialist on healthy habits and all the way related. But this guy is accurate on all the stuff he talks about. With logical arguments. Besides that, he is phisical therapist. He has background and is a mostly "all natural" in the way he teach   a strongly trusworthy guy. Thank you Jeff.

What time of day should you take creatine and how much for a woman around 120lbs, age 25, kickboxer. Not looking to "look like a dude" but carve out things more.

Is not eating breakfast a bad thing ? Cause I never do
i cut beer for pure vodka... super healthy
My new trainer!!!
He's really motivational :D
I'm 156 pounds and about 5'10 and everyone is surprised by my weight because I am just slim like I have no fat and I am also surprised how I weigh 156 when I'm slim and slightly toned can someone explain this cause I have no idea
So is there like an actual meal plan to get abs and gain muscle? Like day to day stuff you are supposed to be eating? Just wondering
I don't know man, I've heard people that only use "juice" and make massive gains :3
Is munching on dill-pickle sunflower seeds healthy?
I am a really fussy eater that doest eat meat of any dairy, I like mostly all fruits and veg but my dinner is mostly carbs every day. does anyone know what I can do
10:45 "...its like throwing a deck chair off the Titanic...."
love your stuff Jeff! You are seriously my professional idol!
almost daily after eating at mcdonalds i walk 5 steps hope i get 6 packs soon
i love this video and I like how real you are about everything. Definitely subscribing.
Very Helpful!
Sounds good. Now what do I eat...??
How often should we eat? I've had 8 pack abs for a good while and I'm not satisfied at all, I want to shred more. I use to eat strictly tuna,chicken, and bananas,that's it. I made good gains but I wasn't sure if I should cut the bananas and put in rice or something. Whatever I have to do please help!
Great, honest advice, man. I'm currently doing intermittent fasting. I have my breakfast before 7 am and then I fast from 7 am to 6 pm. Then I have a small meal and hit the gym around 9 pm and have my final meal after the gym. It works out for me because I have a job in marketing and have a ton of work to do so I skip lunch everyday to get more work done. Hoping for that promotion real soon!
I'm sorry but that "eat more often" is just bs... it doesn't matter when you eat.. its WHAT you eat! if you control the portion then it won't matter if you eat lower amounts more often in the day or less often and bigger amounts....  just eat the right stuff and it won't affect you in any negative way.
how do you guys feel about milk ?
my proportions are soo fucked tho. My legs are long, got a fat ass, and my torso really short. it's so hard for me to show my abs it's frustrating.
One word. Cut the crap
Can u do ab workouts on a bed?
hi, i was thinking for a bit and wondering, what would happen if i completely cut out the carbs in my diet plan? for the moment it looks like following: for bulk: 187 protein, 80 fat, 356 carbs. and for cut: 187 protein, 64 fat, 250 carbs.
Well presented.
Solid video, thank you! No bs, appreciated!
Good job. This man knows what he's on about.
Is a lot of yogurt good?
What about drinking milk? Is drinking milk bad?
like throwing a deck chair off a titanic ;)
Man, juice and cool aid makes me gain fat fast!!! Had to get rid of the Cipie cup lol
what if you don't have a lot of money and are on a budget
I Love your honestly and the simple way you give the info. nowadays there's a tons of  misinformation that only contradict itself and confuses everyone. thank you so much for the way you do your videos, it really helps and inspire me to do better, eat better and train harder
Those comments about oatmeal packets and juice made this video entirely worthwhile. Those small differentiations are what's going to make the difference.
awesome video, very helpful
I want abs just to look at myself in the mirror
how tall is he
If only you guys could just listen to this man and spread the truth of becoming a real human being that can survive in life... But the problem is, you can survive in this world without health, you can eat shit fake food and play games and twiddle ur fucking thumbs without ever working a job or become a real woman or man that can walk through life with strength and agility then manuever around all these problems people get stuck on mentally from being weak, fat, or just all around helpess because they have never trained they're body and found out that we are 1 of the most insane animals on this earth that can jump, lift, think, eat... survive....
Man, Jeff...I needed that.  You just b*&ch-slapped the man-wuss-child out of me.  Winter may be coming, but so is CHANGE!
Fuck the macros
Just got a pro version of your app.
do you continuously flex your abs?
Genuine guy.
is 75 grams of protein a day enough to build muscle?
what are macros?
vegen diet
gluten free diet
i hate it when i get trippled crit on a thursday, the meta is broken.
Great video, thank you!! What do you think of the ketogenic diet?
Boom
great video
What would you recommend for energy in the mornings? I don't like coffee and it's the only reason I drink Mountain Dew. I'll try any reasonable replacement until I naturally have energy from food.
i started this a month ago and dropped 23lbs of body fat already
I count my macros and I eat plenty of good carbs veggies and fats and protein and when I go out on the weekiends I eyeball or give myself a little treat and fit it into my macros occasionally here and there a slice of cake on the weekend won't destroy your physique but a slice of cake everyday will !
much needed scolding
pls help me my weight is stuck at 55 i want abs its stuck from past 5 months pls help
Man I eat way too much sugar :/ I still have great abs, but they would be better if I stop eating pizza and candy
im a girl who actually only have a little belly fat on my stomach, what i have to eat correctly? and i have never get a answer of if i should eat youghurt or not ?
i have 5 to 6 glasses of 2% milk a week my goal is to go from 20-25% body fat to 9% should i stop drinking milk?
UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I HATE EATING HEALTHY
Should I start doing a diet plan if I'm 14 years old?
Jeff I have a question if I have been trying to eat right and still try to get the gym even though I Lil ones and work how can I stick to a workout plan?

F#"%! the macros lol =)
Should I drink milk?
#Garrett Moldrem Mad respect for Jeff. @roy renaldy
You are amazing man! keep it up !
My friends liked to determine me much thinner. I were able to lose 21 pounds using the diet I discovered here https://t.co/zjzoZYAvVd
Basically all u need to do is caloric deficit, progressive weight lifting, and decent protien.
thx for the tips, I'm starting to train
See at the beginning I knew what foods are good for me and what foods are bad for me, but I always thought to myself that I eat pretty healthy. I just wanted to make sure what is _actually_ good for me and what isn't.
Are chillinuts unhealthy?
throwing the deck chair off the titanic line really got me looool
I'm really confused should you go on a caloric deficit or "eat more" caloric surplus? because you supported caloric deficit in some other videos
I can't believe you used to eat that!!! How the fuck did you change and get where you are today!!!!!!!?? Unbelievable ! So awesome man love these videos!!!!
I binge on junk a lot. I will begin this plan tomorrow. Wish me luck and support. :) (Monika, 22, Hungarian, female)
JEEF thank you so so much for this video
Thanks, great video! Very encouraging. "Cut the crap". Well said, I needed to hear that. Although I run and hit the gym daily, I haven't seen as many gains as I should've by now because I still eat pretty much whatever I want. I can honestly say that since I've cut out alcohol and soft drinks,  I have lost 15 pounds in about 2 months. I'm sure once I "Cut the crap" out of my diet even more, I will see more gains and become more lean. Thanks again!!!
TRUTH! Thank you for this video. It is filling in the correct metabolic/physiological facts and confirming my workout research.
Lol best diet I know of and I love it. Drink a gallon of water, only eat whole foods.
Awesome video love the tips !
I love the way he says "Fuck the Macros"
Thank you for the help. Everything you said was true!
I'm 1.90 and weigh 71 kg, My problem is that I don't gain weight that I can turn in to muscles no matter how hard I try... I feel like I'm doing something wrong, Is there maybe a list on the internet on what And when I should eat to get more body fat?
Someone answer this question please i've been skipping my diet for a long time now and now its just common for me to not eat it , should i start eating it again?
i can attest to simply cutting the crap for weight loss. as soon as i did i lost a ton of fat instantly when i first started working out when i was 13
A good fast weight loss diet can keep your health and even make the body burn a lot of fat quickly. I'll show you what I did to lose weight quickly. I went on a weight loss program that is very complete and foolproof. I lost my belly and 22 pounds. I found the diet here https://t.co/thX7NnDC35
Hey ;) Have u seen that new book about weight loss in 3 weeks? https://t.co/OGqCEwajdPThat tutorial includes also getting perfect 6-pack ABS
hii #ATHLEAN-X when should i take protein before workout or after
Ding Dongs, Ring Dings - I don't even know what that is :D
Great advice! Keep up the good work
1:36 Batman
hey jeff from athlean-x, can you make a diet plan for the people who work the night shift? or make a video about when you should eat if you work 3rd shift. it would be greatly appreciated. I find it very hard to follow a diet plan with my work schedule. thank you.
I can't afford to eat right or as often as I should. :( yes, I did cut the crap. but its just so expensive anymore. with bills being so high. its just hard. because I know what I have to do but budget won't let me.
I'm trying to help my parents lose weight and I'm watching these videos so they can help me, thanks
He yelled at me 😨😔 (jk) but good video 👍
are nutty buttys too terrible? haha
How the hell can anybody give this a thumbs down? It's information.....
can you make a video one vegetarian diet. Do you think it is possible to maintain a diet plan by being strictly vegetarian. (No EGGS. Dairy is ok)
Bravo! Love this so much!!!
Mad respect for Jeff.
Great video Jeff as always. I have alot of body fat to lose especially in the abs region. I hate it but i'm "owning" it so to speak and am in the process of getting rid of it by implementing or at least doing my best to implement healthier eating and regular gym.
Are trick or treat candies ok?
love this dude videos
very direct and informative
what about skim milk
Am not eating any more crap (crisps /biscuit / sweets and chocolate until my birthday that 8months away
I did 100 sit ups at the gym and then ate a bag of sour patch kids. Then exploded.
I used to be fat, I lost weight,ate healthy,increase intake of healthy food, put on muscle, and I went from 240-190 ,190-182, and now 182-205. I throughout the process I've had this lil Flab right at the bottom of my "4 pack" and I feel the 6th pack in there, but I just can't get rid of it. it's weird too, it fluctuates in size..not by a whole lot, just a lil less when I wake up, and a lil more at the end of the day. I do ab workouts i try to follow what you guys say. is there anyway to get rid of the 'flab' or is it just something I'd have to surgically remove?
One does not simply give ups Maccas and KFC
Holy Sh*t he used diet in the title shouldn't it be nutrition
what about coffee
6 abs = Pace
Steak every single day? How to get heart disease 101
but.... what about the macros?.....
Fuck the macros XD
"it's like throwing a deck chair off the titanic"! 😂
A first time on ur channel u talk sense my friend...I carry a belly and there has to be a six pack there somewhere this is what I want to see...can you help me friend
Thanks a lot. I truly mean this. I'm a freshman college student who gained a bunch of weight in the first couple weeks. I used to be a track athlete but after my Sr. Year it all stopped. I had the body but even then I wasn't eating properly. That's because I always had track to burn that fat. Now all I have is the gym. I'm not getting the intense workouts anymore but I know I want my body back. This just motivated me. And with this, I can stay fit 24/7 365. Keep up the great work please. I watch a lot of your videos. You reach people. You reached me💯
il drink water in my sippy cup. what you gonna do bout it
Great refreshing video with no BS. Thanks.
This guy actually gives good advice - and I'm normally a sceptic
Ok I wil start if from Tomorrow
I want to get bigger, but i dont know how to. You have so many videos and i dont understand which one i have to do First.
You speak the truth and easy to understand, no wonder you're at 2m+ subs keep it up the best tips muscle building YouTube channel out
you are the man!
thanks a ton man :)
So simple... so GREAT!!!! Thanks Jeff...
Ranting is awesome as we all dooo know what we need to do... it is sobering and like kids we need to be told told and told again ... eventually it gets in... include the gals in the rant though Jeff ... the Moms want to look great next to their man and have the energy for work play kids etc... Thanks Jeff :) you are most inspirational
awesome thanks Jeff... words of absolute wisdom!!
Get rid of your sippy cup! The one liners just keep on coming
If you question your excess, it's probably excess! Bwahahahahaha
i can't stop eating corn fleaks 💔💔 but i train my abs everyday for 30 minutes
I connected junk food to the times when i was a child singing along to all the yummy for your tummy commercials and now that i know that the junk food companies needed to market the kids mind to associate food with pleasure and as a reward.. I took the child out of me and put in the adult that knows junk food kills and that is nothing to celebrate over..that is how i stay away from junk.processed food and sugar..I actually hate sugar now..
Is drinking ALL WATER bad or should I have mostly water and some milk and juice here and there
Eat more often? I call bullsh*t on that one. Ever heard of intermittent fasting?! I've never felt healthier, stronger or looked leaner since ditching the eating every 3 hours philosophy. I'm actually shocked you advocate the eating often bro-science.
2015: You have to get rid of cheat days. 2016: Cheat days are great.  I know context is missing, but is not missing by me. =P
Jeff is in a different class , thank you for your honesty concerning a healthy lifestyle,  keep doing what you doing !!!
well said!!
I managed to shed 40lbs using this Dr Oz diet I found on Google: https://plus.google.com/106375328030244180874/posts/8rhToBBBeMb
i think u showed watch watch ur abs they r soo skinny
get rid of your sippy cup 😂💀
To this day I still haven't gotten up after getting crit by his macros comment
Im drinking alot alot alot of juices/milk  is that considered crap?
Pix or it didn't happen
does this mean I can't eat quest bars?
What bout vegetarians?!
I'm diabetic, so I'm screwed on the "stable" blood sugar portion.
I gave this video a thumbs up as soon as I heard f*** the macros 👍
Achievement makes me happy :) No chocolate sundae, or soda, or chocolate cake is better than achievement.
em why he don't have  any pack
his biceps are big!! This is my goal!! TY for all your advice!
so the marcos dont matter
This is bullshit the only thing you need to worry about is a caloric deficit I can eat ice cream and pizza everyday and get ripped abs.
it's probably excess.
Love this :)
Didn't learn a damn thing here.
Great channel bro
Sir what's your comment on milk? Like 500ml of milk a day ?
Can I eat vegetable sticks
what about sugar and soduim ? how much should we take?
Thank you!
water is the key
well is it cool if you dont eat a cheatmeal everyday and its once in a while 🤔
probably the hardest part in getting ripped tbh 💯 lmao
Great video!! best part was: "F*&* the Macros." Keep up the good work
when making oatmeal/porridge, do you use milk or water?
Jeff, what are the best supplements to eat, drink, or take in those times of need when your getting hungry? I usually can cover my mornings well and pick my meals but once I get to school I am forced to grab the not so best choice at times because of time constraint to get to my next class and the actual food selection. I completely understand and know this method works as I used to play professional baseball. When I did it though I was not in this situation with school. I am trying out this "complete cookie" but I'm not buying it because when I did do this method I had more fiber in my diet keeping me full a little longer and cleaning out my system daily. Please send me some suggestions and some key factors to pay attention to. Love the videos as well. Pelvic position, abs to correct that, etc. Like I said as a x athlete I know about all this deep information which is great that you are giving to the public for FREE.
this guy is the best.  he deserves 2 million plus subscribers, more than any fitness channel I have seen.  excellent.
can I has 1 slice of pizza in the mornings? like 3 days a week?  I go to the gym 3 times a week for 30-45 min
great Jeff exactly what I needed to hear 👍
Loved it!
I haven't been this inspired since tony from p90x
Can you make a playlist of losing weight and turning into a muscle man
Yeh cause every guy here is thinking about looking good when he goes out with his 'Wife' lmfao.
I really enjoy your videos. I started hitting the gym, and progress was good, but you've helped me improve from "bro lifting" to something much more effective. So thank you
2:13 Damn it...
So glad I came across Jeff smh this guy the truth!
You look great! awesome info, you definitely get out what you put in.
It might be a rant but it was great.
i work at dunkin donuts....😢😢😢
This handy instruction was fantastic! I also searched for “loli special plan” on Google and within just one week I had lost 9.5 pounds. You should check it asap
When he said he was the worst eater but then you realize you eat worse than him.
Fuck the macros thumb up lol  Things with macros is that you cannot accurately calculate your calories consumed during the day.   Therefore you cannot accurately calculate how much you need to "hit" everyday.    And you cannot accurately calculate macros, either.   Do you measure your food and species and those stuff in a lab? No.  Don't tell me 600kcal that you find on myfitnesspal is really what you ate  And you'd gone insane by looking at those number in the end you still way off your "macros" which is really ironic   Intuitive eating simply works better.  I think you get your macros closer to the goal than measuring and calculating everything.
I think novice lifters and bodybuilder do not understand this video I've been gone through SO MUCH and SO MANY years of training.  Tried all types of things know pretty much all knowledge about this industry.   Right now I see the real exprience point and credits behind this video   But unfortunately novice might trust Jeff but they wouldn't fully understand until they go through mistakes and come back then realize how true it is
I cant eat much. We dont have any food here.
FUCK THE MACROS!!!! Lol
I wasn’t familiar with the “loli special plan” (Google it) till a good partner applied it to lose plenty of extra unwanted fat. It is surely something you should try.
As a final point, a diet manual that was easy and quick to read. The “loli special plan” (search Google) is the very first diet that I can not wait to get started on. I have loosen 11 pounds in a week.
that one subscribe click to this channel changed my life. Blessed be that one second it took me xD
I'm confused  I am a female   If I am eating like 3 Oreo biscuits but it fits my macros is it considered a cheat meal or not   And my weight has been the same for the last three weeks but I see that I have lost fat and gained muscle when am I going to lose more weight   I eat 1300 to 1400 calories a day  And workout with t25 5 times a week
Thanks for the straight talk it makes sense thank you again and keep it up. Market yourself as 'abs straightalk' and you ratings will go way up.
Thank you sir this really helped!
Ok so that is my case now. I am 16 1/2 years old and I started going to the gym 3 months ago. I did see improvements. But now I am at 17-18% body fat and it just does not want to go down. I can see kind of some lines of my sixpack, but only if I flex. And even then it doesnt look like a nice sixpack. (Obviously). My nutrition is kind of weird. I stopped drinking coke and started drinking water (4 bottles each day) I also started eating healthier (no Nutella, no chocolate, no sweets) , however here is the problem. I still live with my mom and dad. I told my mom to buy chicken breast, brown rice, oatmeal and all of that. But she can't cook something SPECIFICALLY for me. In our family we eat a lot of normal white rice and meat (kebab). Also spaghetti. They are full of carbs and I can't say to my mom "stop cooking that! I dont eat it" u know? What should I do? Maybe start  cooking for myself? idk...
@athlean-x if I could like this video a thousand times, I'd do it
do you have a cheat day?
He reminds me of my high school gym teacher lol
What's the verdict on protein bars like OneBar? Are they good to have as a meal between meals?
this video has motivated me so much! thank you.
How do I make my head lose weight?
Why would your heart not like eating steak? Steak is very healthy!
Great video!! Love the advice and it's all true to the point that we need to do in order to reach our goal
when cutting u still have to take cretain?
Do macros help get bigger balls? .. Mmmmmm fuck the macros lmao
I'm 13 and starting now
ok so if someone sees this and can help please reply: I'm 13 and skinny like a twig, I want a six pack to help me in my sports cuz I'm good at basketball and I can go almost a day or two without eating but the thing is I binge eat at night. i stay up until 4 am sometimes and just eat and eat (I don't really gain weight). is there anything I can do to stop this?
I started following it helped me a lot to cut my external oblique portion fat and also my upper abs got clear, still working on lower abs portion. Thankyou :)
you mean nutrition plan, not diet plan
I'm going to start this right now
This is probably the best training tips channel on YouTube. You're awesome!
im a picky eater though
That guy is the best, I respect him so much!
supercool plan n motivation..lov ya
"F*'ck the macro's!" yeah Jeff. lmao
can i drink coffee if i want to be healty
should I give up this liquid diet. It sucks
Yeah erm, no. I have cheat days and my muscle development is still where I want it to be. Restricting yourself from eating foods you like is the quickest way to failure. It's about moderation and self control, just like any thing in life, which is supposed to be enjoyed for that matter. With that being said, donuts for lunch, definite Nono...
11:52 FUCK MACROS hahaha
so what carbs can you actually eat as so many diff trainers and articles say diff things any help would be appriciated
god damn the roast is strong
whats funny is this tool doesnt even have a 6 pack
I'm 16 and have a six pack
I have a cup and a half of OJ (not from concentrate, extra pulp) in my smoothie every morning. Should I cut it out and replace it with water?
is cheese bad if so how bad
30-40% body fat, it doesn't matter anymore.. lol
💘💕
gatorades are good 4 u
You just got a new sub
If you want to get a six pack can you eat greek yogurt and honey mustard, and if not what are some healthier things
Thank you, these steps helped me a lot with my diet.
i got fat flabs on the tummy area. i have muscles underneath and i know this coz i exercise. and i feel it too. but  this fat flab won't come off.  so i guess it's diet. i eat rice everyday. asian that way
Could u replace soda with sugar free lemonade
HMMMMM I have a very big question here!!! Im too skinny! Im more than 1.75 meters height and like 55 kg give or take!  So... I saw another video... and said that if you're skinny you should eat whatever you want to gain  weight so as to make muscles... well my most wanted muscle group is a 6pack... do i have to really watch my diet as well? like no potato chips no energy drinks or coca cola and stuff??? PLEASE ANSWER ME im so bothered with whats wrong or right for my situation!
MWell my problem is : I'm 175 cm and 65 kg .. And I'm working-out to get my abs and lately I already have my abs but I've a little belly Fats which prevent the abs to show up or appear so I started to make a diet and running every day but unfortunately I just lost weight and I became so skinny and face looks so tired and got dark circle around my eyes without losing my belly fats  And my abs still didn't appear 😞😞😞  ..... I don't know now what should I do I look so sick because of the diet but without any result on my abs

I have a tip if when you lift weights and you push your arms up to it but your backagainst a wall
"Fuck the Macros!" This guy is deep real in helping. Highly Appreciated it!
"Fuck the Macros." This guy is deep real in helping. Thankyou bro. Higly appreciated it.
I've been working out and eating right, I do suffer from belly fat but, will eating more and maintaining a work out routine really get me there?
Priceless... Thanks !
Great stuff man.
f the macros!!!! lol...i love this guy!
My problem is I can eat healthy, but love my two IPA's every night. :(
*If you have to question if it was excess its probably excess*  right when i started questioning hell of a timing got you a sub and a like if that means anything :p
I kicked the sugary drinks from my diet its not hard at all. The down side is I go to the gym once or twice a week. So I hav a flat stomach, but not lean muscle.
Thank you for the help!

I'm 14 I'm chubby but I wanna be like my cousin he's been lean all his life and he has a beautiful GF and I wanna be like him better if I can
you're really good man...!!
😂😂😂
😂😂😂
ive been with this channel 4 a few years and all i haft to say is ... i thought jeff was stupid when i first started  i thought he didnt even know what he was talking about but then i realized i was staying the same size because  i was eating sundaes like he said. but i was burning it off. well i decided to listen to what he says i saw results within the first 2 months. ive been with this channel for 5 years and ima tell u straight up your first work out is gonna burn but just because u worked out for 1 hour  dont think u deserve a rest day nope u get up and workout again because youre gonna get more results .listen to jeff because i look just like him now .
but useful
omg tis vid is so funny tho haha
but supplements r expensive tho
very vague advice
that guy just made me the day  at the end saying fuck the macros like seriously fuck them theyre so stressful i just need to eat more often and good...
I'm a skinny 13 year old I have a gut i way about 80 pounds and I get made fun of and I want to work out i think it would be best for me and others will see me in a whole different way 😕 this inspired me to start working out I can't even do 2 push-ups without getting tired and can't to any chin ups so I'm starting to work out but don't know the type of thing I should be eating daily please help.
cut the crap eat more good stuff often for fuel yesss love it
Honestly I can't survive without Diet Coke lol is that something I need to cut?
I personally saw big difference after I firstly cut the crap and then eating correctly at night. (fruits/salad with something else for the protein). I didn't do small meals I ate a lot at breakfast and at noon when I got back home from work. It worked for me. But remember your metabolism needs FUEL in order to work so you need the calories, just pick the good ones at the right time during your day.
jeff should run for president
The "fuck the macros" comment crit me for 5000 damage
I have a busy schedule with architecture in field, I get hungry lot a time after college, so should I eat outside stuff,@athleanx, please tell what should I follow n how
Geezo youŕe easily/aspirationally approachable. Hey Jeff, is milk as bad as 100% fruit juices ? Ie really drank fruit/high fructose cornsyrup blends. But is milk as bad as fruit juices ? And is mixing a 0 cal. powder stick into water ? I just soooo don like just plain water Ieff.  Thanks for your response, and the encouraging VIDs.
Do you offer vegan nutrition? Btw Great Videos!!!
Inspiring. Thanks for uploading this
Cheers Boss
fuck macros! hahaha
my problem is i eat too many carbs... i have lowered it to under 50 grams.  up my cardio , let see if anything happens... i am around 18 percent  body fat.
Hey guys what did he say about whole grain... at  5:47
Do you recommend taking protein shakes? @athlean x?
Great job breaking it down into simple practical ways.
wat if u look like fat albert
Damn it taking about dunkin donuts and all those crappy foods got me hungry
I'm really impressed with the knowledge this guy exhibits. There are so many other YouTube trainers who cannot explain exercises with this amount of scientific backing. Glad I found this channel!
Should I stop eating rice! I'm indian, it's my staple food 😇
I have a 7 pack
I used to be a 5-6 small meals guy. But I've actually been seeing the best fat loss results of my life doing intermittent fasting. This is where you do a 16hr fast (during sleep and 8hrs after waking) and then take in your calories during the final 8hrs over 2-3 meals. This leads to more satisfying meals and it's easier to calorie track IMO.
Tysm for ur tips ( Jeff cause ur tips i've lost 38 kg).  Tyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
You always had your abs...
I am so sick of other sites talking about macro's all the time.A lot of truth in this video.Thanks Jeff.
so I guess Kool-aid isn't really okay to drink even though it's like 90% water.
too much taking
Awesome video it was really helpful And i liked the way you said " fuck the macros"
Can anyone just tell me the points of this video im too lazy to watch until the end lol
thankyou.
im 5'7''  160lbs (i should be around 10% bf) - my upper abs are pretty ripped, but i have a small amount of fat on my lower abs and also my hips that i cant get rid of. im currently doing a intermittent fasting 16/8 but im still not loosing weight. my daily intake is about 1800kcal on workout days and 1500 on days off.  im afraid to go any lower on my kalories, because sometimes i feel really exhausted during the day and im often pretty hungry. i also tried a low carb and even no carb diet for a couple of weeks but i felt tired even more. i feel like im in a deficit since forever but my weight is just staying the same. my training sessions are still pretty intense, but i get a feeling of getting weaker. what do you suggest to do?
22 and at the beginning of my own journey to good health and physique. Really love this content. +1 sub
I love you.lol. you're great. thank you for keeping it real
How about if I'm fasting?
real shit broo
i know what crap i eat i am going to change i want to look good i have muscles bu i have to much fat thanks for your video
Love the honesty!!
One question I'm a sophmore in highschool and there stuff like hamburger and popcorn chicken and sunflower curnels  and I drink water, juice, and chocolate milk is this a okay diet for getting abb's
how do you prepare all these meals if you don't have much time? what constitutes as a meal?
LOL FUCK the MACROS!
I tried the whole 5-6 healthy small meals a day, eating even though I wasn't hungry and I actually gained weight and felt sluggish. I went back to eating 2-3 healthy meals and started losing weight and seeing more tone in my body. Different strokes, I guess.
Thanks man👍👍👍 I really needed to hear that!!!!!! I've just started to get myself in shape😁😁 sometime you need a good kick arse😉😉😉 So thanks you and I'll keep on watching😁👍😁👍
"Fuck the macros!". Jeff is great.
I really wish I could eat more, I have belly fat but I'm really skinny and we don't have much food, but I have plenty of water. Probably won't help.
Most guys want six packs to impress women. Most of the time that's not enough motivation
this is not so specific..
Thanks bro! I needed this✊🏾💯
this guy is aweome... speaking striaght truth
I love beer, I can't help it.
The comment about being a dad with energy to play with your kids got me good. That is one thing that I need for my daughter. Thank you for this video. This will give me that drive that I need.
you had to talk about chocolate cake at the end of the video, smh. as i was making gains and shi too
thanks for the honesty with your previous diet. Makes my 6 pack goal more attainable, knowing you made it from what you started with.
cut 80% of the food I eat, ahaha =D however, you can always burn more than you eat.
with number two, eating more frequently also increases the thermic effect, the body will burn more calories if its got to digest food more often
He speaks truth fellas
Jeff's a f*ckin' G. Best channel on here. All science and no bullshit
Haha f@ck the macros 😂😂😭👌
"FUCK THE MACROS!!!" Best line, EVER!!  Eat well, work hard, get results.
I have stretch marks on 40% of my body does it disturbs girls cuz my abs are already showing and I'm 14 with that many stretch marks I hate my life
what if you can't live without chocolate 😂
A
Dis motivation for me :)
I gotta give it to you man. You look like you practice what you preach so I listen to you plus I  like the fact you mentioned the truth about the supplementation. What works and what is a scan,not so much on this video but in general on your other ones. Cheers man keep up the good job.
best piece of advice, I enjoy the way you don't talk for 15 mins and tell me what I could have if I buy your DVD, keen to start working on a set of abs I'll be proud of
jeff cavaliere your awesome dude i look up to you welldone bro :-)
what's the best coffee to drink to keep a healthy diet? right now im drinking coffee with almond milk and honey or sugar cane syrup. but i drink about 2 cups a day. is this a right choice?
Thank you for the rant. Subscribed because of it.
so basically I can't eat any sweets for the rest of my life?
Jeff is a straight savage. had me laughing my ass off at fuck the macros!
ive found some really good stuff in your other videos so ithought this would work for me. Is there any other way that doesnt require eating 12 times a day?
you dont what foods???
u r the best jeff do not get determined by the simplicity of this plan !!! but F the Macros !!! was the best hahahaha lol!
congrats man, im 42 have Crohns disease. i have a tough time with vitamin absorption.  i have swollen gut but my legs are good and arms are not bad. the inflammation is terrible on my tummy region. any advice you all can provide would be great. I also have fatigue problems from the disease. look forward to any tips on inflammation. thanks God Bless.
This is one of the best if not the best video I've seen concerning this topic.  Thumps up this man speaks the truth !!!
I watched this while eating a bag of doritos.  I have no idea what "the crap" in my life is.
jeff is the fuckin truth man
No way! Another meal plan that i have to pay for when i can just google it for free?!?!?!
Fuck the macros!
so no more pizza? :(
fuck water,regardless of what people will say its tasteless and disgusting, ima stick with tea
dis works I tried it
I have a simple rule: If it has a TV commercial, I don't eat it.
I'm down 61.3 lbs down since Feb 2015. Gooing to the gym 4 times a week. Prep my meals Evert sunday for the week. But my abs are no where near from showing. I am 6ft tall and weigh 191.8. Thank you for the vids. Motivation helps the most.
FUCK THE MACROS!
Yawwwwnnnnnn
Just enjoy abs whilst you're young when your metabolism is a rocket
macros
Jeff, how do you feel about tea???
As a person that has always liked Oatmeal I found as I got older I began to hate the porragy texture. I switched to steel cut oats. much better. this is a tip to anyone that hates the normal texture and wants something different with their oats.
I too lazy to get away from Panda Express, lol
i started changing my diet to low carb 60-80g (no grains, added sugar,  good fats, 80-100g protein) 2 months ago i had  211lbs now i'm at   176lbs (6"2 height) .. i started lifting 1 month ago.. and i feel great  .. but the problem right now for me is.. first of all i look so skinny  now, really way  too skinny.. but bodyfast is still too high so i dont  have any 6pack showing yet, the overall muscles are not enough either..  whats the best way for me to lose the rest of my bodyfat and build more  muscles?
I am doing exactly this and its working. This guy tells it like it is, subscribed. IF might work for some people and thats great. I myself used to do it all the time. However trying this method here, I'm actually finally managing to gain muscle and get rid of the last bit of fat I have, can currently see a 4 pack.
hahahahahahahahaha @ "fu*k the macros"! OH MY GOSH that was the funniest thing i heard...TY Jeff for being so straight forward! if i could tumb up more than once, id hit that like button 100 times just for that comment Alone....hahahahaha
lmao - "Fuck the macros"
I'm appalled by the fact that someone with a background like his didn't cover THE most important step...Guys, you can eat all the healthiest food available every single day...but if you're eating more than you're supposed to, you'll not get anywhere...YOU NEED A CALORIC DEFICIT FOR A 6 PACK.
CUT THE CRAP BITCHES YES !
da fk is often?
F@$! The macros guys👌😊
Ok I'm a teen my mom cooks home made dinner I could name some like pork chops green beans and sometimes potatoes can I still get abs yes I'm a teen to be exact 14 years old
Personally i would like to know the specific supplements you are talking about, i know creatine being one of them. Any others, being specific to help get cut?
I love you Jeff, but I have never felt more stable, energy wise, since i have this last year, when i started intermittent fasting. I never have sugar highs or sugar lows anymore... I am constantly at a steady level, plus, the other health benefits are really noticeable. Such as clearer skin, improved focus and memory etc. I also helped my mum slowly come off her meds and beat her type 2 diabetes after so many years of doctors not being able to do shit for her. It is much easier to increase your water intake too when doing IF. I am slightly curious, why a guy, who i consider generally the most knowledgeable fitness guy on youtube, seems to either be against IF , or just hasn't researched IF in detail?
Thanks very helpful
What you are saying about other techniques to get and keep a sixpack ie counting macros or Intermittent fasting, is bull - there is more than 1 way to skin a cat..  EVERYONE is different - it doesnt mean that these other techniques do not work or you cannot stay consistent with them. The whole point is to find out what works for you and what you can fit into your lifestyle. I can way easily to intermittent fasting that eat 6 meals a day - PS, been doing it for about a year and a half and it has become a lifestyle that i can consistently do. That is all.
core is life
this guy's awesome
am eating alot of fruit and drinking alot of water and protain and healthly dinners and healthly snacks is this a good way to diet and train am starting of training is this a good way to go to lose belly fat and build abit of muscle
Plus i already have abs
Lol im watching and i am like 12 years old but not fat but i am building muscles
hi ,,does eating 2 cups of rice every meal makes your fat tummy more bigger??
Now thats food for thought. ( excuse the pun)
I eat porridge in the morning and nuts is that good
so hard not to eat chocalate
I am 48 years old now, but at 45 years old I had reached a 52" waist and weighed in at 297 lbs. I made many of the changes that you are talking about in this video and I am now a 28" - 30" waist at 176 lbs. I now drink a lot of water and it has made a huge change.
That's exactly why I sub to this guy's Chanel & watch him on a daily although I'm no rookie @ fitness he keeps it a 💯 every time
Can you make a video that shows  how to live healthy on a budget? I've started to improve my diet, but my wallet has been emptying along with it.
Great advise
Ok, so now i've gotten my situation to a point where i can afford enough food to make gains. I have been eating something like this Breakfast: a bowl of Oatmeal and tea + some 1% milk in the oatmeal Lunch: Whatever they are serving at school (In finland it's usually healthy but often lacking in protein) Dinner: 1 Chicken breast (With some salt and pepper so i can swallow it), Rice about 1.5 dl of brown rice, and 1/3 plate of peas, corn, paprika, etc.  I also have a protein shake after my workouts and drink about 1.5L of water during workouts and 1 otherwise during the day. Problem is i have no idea how much i should eat. Im aware it is somewhere in the 2500-2900 calorie range. But i don't know how much i need to eat to achieve that. Also im pretty sure that i need more protein in my diet which i guess i can gain to some degree by adding a couple eggs to breakfast. Anyone have any pointers? Edit: I only eat 3 meals a day because of time limitations, but i could eat 4 a day + a snack at some point if i really stretched it.
awesome message jeff
I love the no BS approach. Preach brother. Tell it how it is my man.
I have never commented on a youtube video before, but you made me.  This is absolutely the best fitness channel on youtube and it goes for everyone regardless of their goals, current position etc! Loads of respect for you Jeff.
Hi Jeff just wondering if u did or have done a video on whey sensitivity and other sources of protein powder. For the longest time I didn't know what was wrong with me and thought that this is just the way my body is..... but I did a food sensitivity test and my whey numbers were off the chart. Just wondering if anyone else has problems with whey and if u come across this much?
I need tips on a meal plan.  I got a very busy schedule. I get up at 2am for job #1. I get off at 10:30 go straight to the gym and get there about 11. work out and go to Job #2. get off at 7:30. get home around 8 and in bed between 9:30 and 10. I need something that I can take with me for a whole day and doesn't take much prep time. PLEASE HELP!!!!
What about fresh juices like fresh orange juice?
What are your thoughts on bread???
My new mantra for myself: cut the crap. Crap food. Crap tv. Crap websurfing time-wasters. Simple, but effective. Cut the crap.
Damn good video man! Love your passion
Does intermittent fasting come into play with this?  I have been trying it for the last 3-4 months with really good results. Thoughts?
That is the only diet that has worked for me, to eat more frequently
I disagree with him about the oatmeal. I still eat plain oatmeal out f the packet and I have abs
Long neck ass
Jeff  What's best after a workout, eating a meal with good protein or a protein drink?  Also for protein drinks, do you grow more muscle faster over time if you have 2 cups of a protein drink after workouts compared if you only had one cup of a protein drink? I don't want to feel like I am putting too many calories back in me when I already burned off 300 - however many calories from my workout. so what would you recommend?
good shit
Love the videos man I just have one quick question. Now is it bad to allow one cheat day like every once and a great while? Like once every 2-3 months?
Could you make a video on carb cycling please?
Does he shave his chest?
What if you drink milk a lot?
Can someone write the type of healthy food he mentioned?   I didnt really understand because he talks so fast.
hey, i wanted to start eating healthy and naturally I started doing all the things and tips you have said without doing any research, sort of started stage by stage.. Great tips :)
this guy make it look so simple
Jeff, you mentioned about using slow cooked oats. I use Quakers quick cook oats. What is the difference in nutrients and which is better and why. Please explain when you have time or anyone with knowledge please answer.
"It's like throwing a deck chair off the Titanic." XD It's true, but I thought it was funny because I wasn't expecting it. That analogy is a great fit. That really gave me the right perspective on supplementation and how being all in at all times is so important.
LOL! @ 11:50. This guy is the real deal. You can tell he's had to work with some hard core, big money mofos.
it's the secret for and thanks Jeff
nice video man. you help me out
I have a question that I can't seem to find a real answer for. I have type 2 diabetes and have to take insulin shots. This effects how many carbs I can eat in a single meal and throughout the day. So how does that effect muscle growth and what is the best way to tackle it? Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you .
sir is a raw cacao make you fat?
Thanks, your advices helped me a lot.
I like you, man.  You"re a very smart, educated individual, and I appreciate your videos
i just do 3 to 4 days cycles, 19 hours fasting , 6 hour eating window  eat every 2 hours I'm lucky if I'm eating at my caloric maintenance, so I'm at a caloric deficit, drink at least 4 litres of water through out the day, then on the fifth day  chill out and recover, to trick the body ready for the next 4 day fasting cycle.  and the weight just falls off.
how do you find your day percentage?
so no more milk??? we snap, don't we need out calcium
I drink plenty of water. When I get tired of water I use a little Chrystal Light
Chicken and veggies.....with more protein and eating 5-6 times a day is what I do.  Boiled eggs in the frig to snack on too.
Thank you now I have a 6 pack :D
i've got a six pack in the fridge.
I'm not looking for quite an athletic physique but i want to be as lean as i can while still putting my all into my daily life. I already am taking part in meal prep and eating healthier, but i am starting pretty much blank on the healthy foods department. I wasn't really raised to eat healthy so i was wondering what were some good foods to eat for smaller meals throughout the day that could add some variety?
La Croix is your friend if you're not a fan of plain water
you sir deserve a cookie :D
anyone eating junk food while watching this too?
Great video~
+ATHLEAN-X You are a WONDERFUL!! THANK you 👏!!
healthy? what's this healthy you speak of?
My problem is that Im so busy throughout the day, that I usually only eat ONE meal per day. This video makes me remember the fact that eating properly is extremely important.
Ha Ha f**& Macros...😂 Great stuff! I'm glad I ran across  this channel. I'm preparing for my DPT as well and a healthier more meaningful Life.
This guy is correct ...but just some insight on someone who wants to drop massive amounts of fat look into the KETO diet ...fats aren't as bad as you think Cut the carbs Cut the sugars...
My gosh man, looking at you is very inspiring.I've been wanting to get nice muscles too but as we all know just wanting something isn't enough; You actually have to work for it.I've had times that I did a little bit and then always stopped after a while, for reasons I don't even know.There are no gyms as far as I know where I live (an island) but there's always things to do to get muscles. Maybe not the most effective ways but anything that could be done is better than nothing.I just happened to come across your videos just now and I have to say you are making me feel ready to try again.Thank you for sharing you experiences and tips. I'm going to be watching more of your videos and work towards a much better physique.
Fuck the macro had me laughing
Thanks man I need to hear this  I am ready now
😂Buahahahahaha lmao listen thanks for keeping it real !! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
I really want to mix up my foods but I keep turning to the oatmeal in the morning end I would like a variety when I go for like a list I know what diet health food store and you know I have about $200 monthly to spend so a list of foods that would Inoh and energy to work out end one more question the stem RX pads not the fake ones the tens the real ones that actually really you could feel it really working muscles and your skiing your sore it was it it was for 9999 a 500 pound machine of those okay once in a while or how how many times a week thanks for everything Patrick
Wonder why 276 people gave a thumbs down? This guy is so smart.I have had 2 knee surgeries year apart from each other 3-4 years ago and just listening to this guy and his tips he gives and the in depth human science behind it has made them that much stronger!
All these people talking and commenting "oh it's proven that" no please just shut the fuck up. If you had it all figured out and had a nice six pack you wouldn't be watching a video on how to get a six pack. Now just sit back, relax, and watch the master..
but señor... I like chocolate sundaes :(
I want a f@ck the macros shirt!!
The only thing is what type of food should I eat in between meals
i haven't eat fast food for two weeks i only drink water and milk i thank you so much you gave me inspiration to do it now i don't want evey fast food or unhealthy food :)
Very good video. Thanks for the tips.
im 15...should my diet be any different from that mentioned in this video?...I ask because at skl im pretty sure i burn calories walking all over and soccer at lunch.
So I have a healthy diet I eat often how often should I supplement ?
i don't understand the chicken thighs and skin are bad but what's wrong with chicken tenders aren't they a part of the breast?? well i eat both full and tenders but sometime when i shop i only find the tenders so i get them anyway!?
Like throwing a deck chair off the titanic.  I like it. HAHA
"It's like throwing a deck chair off the titanic." and "F@#$ the macros" best parts of the video.
"Keyboard scientist" XD
Fucking love this guy's demeanor on everything here and definetly a subscriber.
love this guy.  Is about selling all the time.  He is here to teach.  Thanks
U provided a good outline but no nutritional info
It has been proven that eating every 2-3 hours does not raise metabolism. Also it has been proven that IF works to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time.
Love it! F*ck the macros! Haha
I love listening to Jeff. So mesmerizing.
I NEED insaine  abs
THANKS THOUGH.
I NEED THAT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND.
show us your meal plans - dont need this speil on this and that
"F*ck the macros!" Thank you for speaking some truth!
http://www.trimtuf.com/#_l_as this tea really works you should try it
Just watched this again and still love this video!  Flippen awesome. You've pretty much blown most super complicated weight-loss programs out of the water by giving us a FREE 13 min video that gets us results. No tricks no BS, just raw truth.
Very inspiring!  Thank you.
where is the diet plan?this is simple info, everyone knows this.
this seems legit
"Keyboard Scientist" lmao.
Athleanx, you should talk about how important sleep is.
5 words: i dont have that money
"F*¢€ THE MACROS!" Ha ha ha
Hello  I came up on your videos about month ago . If only I had your wisdom 40 years ago. As Mr Spock would say (Logical flawlessly logicalI )I wouldnt be hurting now. Finally someone that telling the f**king truth I just turn 60 3 month ago. I users look like u ,up to the age 44. But then ,Two rotator cuff surgery at 40,Then keen surgery at 57 . I weight 250 lb. All because of doing everything the wrong way .i  need to get back to 200 or 210 or lower. but you got so many diets. So which one . I got the the pot belly and bad posture . That my hard area. so like u said, I started buy cutting the crap. Step one.i been to your site .but I need little guide for over all workout.
Although eating more often gives you more consistent glucose levels, would doing this create any insulin resistance in the long term due to constant insulin surges (even if you eat slower digesting carbs)?
This is all about motivation. I guess that all advices are obvious and still it's hard to motivate myself to follow them. Should I put a picture of a 6 pack abs at my work place?)
Best fuckin fitness channel out here, great breakdown
Thanks. I needed to hear this. The first to go is the crap.  Got it.  Keep it coming.
I enjoy your channel , sometime I think you talk alot .but you make me want to get up & train , so I am a big fan & keep up the work .
I hear people telling me that they don't know what healthy foods are so I found a way to make it easy to understand. I don't tell them to eat spinach and Kale due to high levels of vitamins and minerals or anything like that. I tell them to eat foods that comes in it's natural form such as anything earth grown or animal protein. The more altered the food is from it's natural state the less healthy it is. Also eat a variety of food to acquire different vitamins and minerals. Last but not least enjoying your healthy foods is more important than eating the healthiest foods imaginable because you will stick to a diet easier. Keep it simple and keep it natural and that's all their is to it.
11:00 through 11:35 was from the heart. Good video, it got me motivated.
The most important Point is missed. Its the deficit of calories. You can eat healthy as fuck, but if you dont minimize the calorieintake you will stay the same!!
Thanks man!
hey guys I started the diet today. am I starting right? I ate salary,lettuce,water and ceral. is that a good start. please tell me if I'm doing good
is one figure percentage of fat non healthy ?
Ive been studying this for a long time simple carbs, complex carbs, lean protein, sat fat and poly sat fat etc but what should my plate look like? and how many meals to keep a body fat percent under 6-8? Ex: 50% protein 35% complex carbs 15% startchy carbs i really dont know wth is right please help!!!!
What are macros?
This makes sense ... no BS
Thank you.
came across your channel by accident and glad i did. Very informative and great tips. Subbed!
Realest youtube channel I've seen so far . Good fucking shit dude keep it up
You tell it like it is. Appreciate it. God stuff
does tea affect the diet ? (no sugar)
Getting abs = Losing fat = Caloric deficit. Having a six pack has nothing to do with food quality, nutrition timing nor meal frequency. This is great advice anyway if you wanna be healthier or have healthier eating habits, but it's not gonna get you a six pack by itself.
drink protein shake before bed,  preferably casein over whey.  As far as supplements go they are fine,  as long as you know how to use them properly.  Just because someone doesn't know how to use a chef knife does not mean they are useless
FML, he looks good!
has anybody noticed he has a really long neck
I wish I could thumbs up this twice. This video is amazing.
Step 4 costs so much money though.
It is the truth, eating every two to three hours cuts your portions. I have been forcing myself to eat more often to keep my metabolism up, and half the time I am forcing myself to eat because I am not hungry.
Is he wearing a six pack jacket?
Anyone that got a six pack in one month ?
fuck chris jones then that guy is always counting his calories lol!!!!!!!
Simply amazing!! Love the straight talk. Honest and heart felt.
Whole grain slow cooked oats eh? Care to elaborate on that? Google image yields "Quaker Steel Cut Oats," Which I'm not sure that is what you mean. Do you mean to cook oatmeal in a crock pot for 5 hours to "slow cook" them?
Boom, nailed it!
I'm a freshman in high school and I'm looking to make that change to be more dynamic in my sports and to look more overall fit. u talked about eating more often. is it anything pretty good tht I can eat during a class session, that would be fueling my body correctly?
I'm 14 so i dont really have that much of a choice of what I can eat apart from lunch
Dude I love your channel. You're educated, eloquent, and very charismatic. Keep up the good work, I'll post my improvement thanks to you in a few month. Greatly appreciated! I also had a question about gyno, I heard there are creams to help get rid of it, what do you know about that?
so well explained. and motivating. few of these tips are exactly what i needed to know. thank you
That's right, fuck makros! Finaly some truth!
Whats your view on taking meal replacements like Lean Body to swap in for meals. I do a full time job during the day and I go to grad school at night, and so its challenging at times to eat every 2 hours.
this channel is better than six pack shortcut
this is seriously the best fitness channel on youtube.
thank u coach for keeping the bullshit to a minimum.
dude I drink milk instead of water (I m 14 years old and I have a clear four pack and v lines but I want to get a six-pack)  should I drink water or milk ?
So then it's a good thing I go to the all you can eat buffets.  I tend to mix it up by eating the junk food, then the fruits and vegetables, and then the deserts.  And that's usually after I finished working out.  So, basically I've been doing the healthy stuff the right way the whole time.  Here I was struggling to eat only nutrient foods. Go me!  Thanks Athlean-x, you made me feel better and more correct about myself.
love your coaching!  í am on the path of getting ABS. Sticking through it
hey how much time does it take to become a physical therapist?
my nigga
💪
What about fruit? I eat LOTS of fruit, but not a lot of juice. I drink mostly sugar free, 0 calorie green tea.  I'm not allowed to eat at work, but do anyway so whatever food I bring has to be easy to conceal, not messy, and easy to clean up.
My plan is to get rid of my junk food give all the junk food to my sister then tell her to work out lmao
not only do you have to cut the crap out of your diet, but also include real food into your diet. did not hear too much about vegetables and fruits. you need potassium, magnesium, as well as, all of the B vitamins. and don't forget vitamin D or C. that also include niacin, riboflavin, and iron..... which brings us to this point. what is this diet, you will also have to include vegetables, fruits, nuts, berries, and drink plenty of water. or you'll ruin your kidneys while plugging your ass
Hey Jeff,   Great channel and great video. As a fitness model and YouTuber myself i always strive to give people the best information keeping in mind that 99 percent of people aren't going to be hardcore fitness buffs.  So for example, instead of telling people to flat out eliminate junk food i think its important to teach people other strategies, such as using this junk food as a post workout insulin spike, and then after time eliminating it from their diet.  Also doing things like consuming apple cider vinegar and matcha green tea around junk food can help to block the insulin release and keep slim, even when eating junk food. Great video tho, your the man!
I like theses video's, I do think it is funny that he didn't wear a shirt.  👕
These are all so true, love all your videos!
broo, have you anything to do with STACK.com? cuz your filosophy is the same and i have readed the same in that online magazine. PD: you have a new fan. keep the hard work
did he tell us to stop drinking juice? cause i still drink banana and avocado juice
this video was a great help for me
I kept getting distracted by his body while he was talking
Well said sir.
I'm Trying my best with this but I find it hard as I don't cook the meals my mum does because I'm only 13 but I do manage to workout everyday at school and the gym so no matter how much I look into nutrition my mum doesn't listen to what I ask her to make and she starts to think I'm ill when I don't eat sugar
every one I'm in my 40s an in the best shape of my life 6pack an all just do what you have to if you really want it
"Like throwing a deck chair off the Titanic" - I don't know why but that made me laugh.
Eating every 2-3 hours sucks in my opinion. Prefer IF and skip all that meal prep. JMO
girlfriend moved out, lost 53lbs in 6 months. did literally nothing except cook for m'self.
Fuck yes, tell it how it is! Keep it up.
I'd like this video more than once if I could.  Great advice on nutrition.
I am starting to attempt to try and get fit and I just finished from a workout , thanks for the video its helping me a lot
I already did everything he speaks of lol.
All I got from this is that I want fried chicken RIGHT NOW! Damn
anyone here swallow raw eggs ?
I am enjoying the whole time agreeing to what he said until i heard a BEEP sound and i completely forgotten everything heard and just saw a Man in Abs in front of me
Dam, he giving game.  Some of best but simple education on reducing body fat I've heard.
I love this guy. He tells it like it is and doesnt let you get away with anything. Plus I love the machinist
Really good video. One that I felt the need to send to a few of my personal training clients. Keep the good info coming.
great video I know you say eat frequently small meals but how small should they be or how big and should your meal be small and still leave you hungry or big enough to leave u satisfied
URGHHHHHH JUST STICK A FINGER IN MY ASS
ABS are great, but say good buy to enjoying food lol I miss food. Ice cream or ABS, ice cream or ABS Ggrrrrrrrr
Thanks, now I need to throw out all the food that I just bought.
I know it's for men, but thx great vid.
I love the absolute no bullshit from this guy, there's no secrets to this and we likely knew a lot of these things already, but he's great for just saying the facts.
Athlean I have a question. When you say eat more often could I eat more apples or what?????
@Alan R I know the struggle. My mom just puts oil on everything.
Keyboard scientists lmaaaaaao! I swear this guy is the best end of story.
You're a bad ass jeff
F*** the macros, guys! Love this guy...
you are super bro...love your videos...thanks a million for wonderful advices..!!
Hey Jeff,why doesnt your website accept payment in rupees(indian currency)?
I get gout when i take creatine!!! What else can i do?
Love this guy!
wtf are macros??!!
what about milk Jeff? non-fat milk are ok ? will it help in building muscle?
u r just telling eat nutritional foods I want to know what is the food I need to eat for breakfast lunch and dinner to get abs
Great video.  I eat pretty clean throughout the week but on the weekends for a snack while watching a movie/relaxing I've been making it a habit of eating some frozen/oven baked chicken mcnuggets or mozzarella sticks (only 4 but w/ veggies and hot sauce/mustard for dip) w/ some wine.  Gonna start cutting this crap out and not make it habitual.  Thanks for the vid
good video and even better wake up call straight to the point,  just what I needed thanks
This is Gospel
I'm only 16 can I drink juice?
now that was inspiring...
Jeff is that guy that tells you stuff that you don't want to hear, but deep down, you KNOW he's right.  (i.e. you want to keep eating that donut thinking you can "burn it off", but you know deep down you can't get away with that and have the body you want)  I started doing basically what he said in early August, and have dropped from 203# at 5' 7", to 181#, while having built a little muscle back since my last "bulk".  My calories are too low for now to build the rest back, but once I get the body fat down to acceptable levels I'll slowly add healthy food so that I gain it back, without gaining tons of fat back.  (I anticipate I'll probably gain a little fat here and there until I dial my diet in, but it'll be nothing like my previous "dirty" bulks, and I'll take off whatever new fat I do gain because I'm done eating junk!)
Preach...everything you said (which I already follow anyways) is golden.  Hopefully people will take your advice.
the "Fuck the macros" made me subscribe haha Wasn't expecting it.
Love the no bullshit approach. Thanks or sharing man! I find this very helpful. Doing great stuff now.
what do you eat in non-training days
What about juice? can I drink juice?
Right between the eyes! Bullseye! Thank you for the enlightenment.
Fuck the macros!!!!!!!! .......my life just change
Motivational
Yala kol 5ara
Food need to be burnt too people who don't workout don't need that much food i think.
This is the most none BS channel on Youtube...
damn!  how do you edit on this thing??
I really do not know what excess alcohol means man.   I go out every friday with friends, and get shit faced. Is that excess?
Amen
You look like silent mike
just realised he dont drink coffee and eat salad
I love Jeff's advice and all the value he is giving. I've done many of his paid programs and they kick ass! The only thing, for me which I kinda disagree with him is tracking calories in and out. Jeff talks how you don't need to track your calories and you get a six pack. I didn't track my calories ( I was eating really clean food) and I couldn't get my six pack truly rocking. Now I've been tracking my calorie intake and I've noticed that I ate too much. Now I've been "calorie deficit" while still getting enough protein and I'm FINALLY getting my abs to show better than ever. Jeff talks about consistency and I think that tracking your calories is maybe the best thing you can do to keep that consistency. Now I can enjoy my cheat meals every now and then without guilt because I can track that shhit and still not go too much overboard with calories. Before I would do my cheat meals on top of all the other food I would eat that day and of course I would gain fat. For me tracking calories seems to be making a HUGE difference and I recommend to try it if you are not getting the results you want and you haven't really tried it. Peace!
Totally true i get hurt with this video but its Damn! True!!
Which is better for abs, hot and spicy or original recipe kfc??
I drink muscle milk but after two weeks I notice that my teeth begin to move and twist, what can I do to avoid this or what protein is better and won't cause this? Anyone????
what he said? i dint have abs?  everyone has abs... sir
bro , I got a lot of respect for you.  I am NPC bodybuilding competitor at the amature level. I know excatly what you mean.  Peopel keep talking about Macros . How about just have the mirror as a judge.  people sometimes wanna lie to themselves and believe the lies.  Thanks brother for caring for humanity .
Good talk.  :)
My nigga
Love your straight forward approach!!!!
But I'm 16, and I don't have any income so I have to eat food my mom makes at home, and the free stuff I get at school. How should I go about this?
nice work mate rings true keep it up brother,
Extremely  enjoyed your breakdown on  the simplicity of living  a healthier  life . Thanks Jeff!
Toooooooo many pop ups! PLEASE STOP IT!
he reminds me of cristian bale
parents idea of health food; broccoli drowned in cheddar cheese sauce, might as well have fucking Kraft Dinner
Great video as always. Found this page a couple weeks ago. I'm a personal trainer and have started to implement some of these philosophies. Thank you for the excellent work.
Hi Jeff, great advice.... following your channel has allowed me to start taking of my health, workout and nutrition wise. Cheers.
no cheat days?..😭😭😭😭😭😭
your workouts are so hard you killed that guy on your right.
You can substitute good fats, like coconut oil, fish oils, organic grass fed butter for sugar to train your body to burn fat faster.  The sugary foods push our buttons for food addiction, we are almost all born addicted to sugar, salt and fat.  Fruit juice without the pulp fiber to even out absorption is almost as dangerous as soda pop.  You have to have the fiber if you're going to drink the juice or you will get sugar spikes which eventually burns your system out of insulin production and you get diabetes.   A simple rule of thumb is to eat only what exists in nature, no candy, no breads, no processed meats etc.  If you eat shit you're going to end up looking like shit.
great straight to the point video
Why is his trousers pulled down and not around his waist? lmao
mah dawg, amen.
Finally!!! The truth is being told. Listen to this guys, it really is this simple. Stop complicating it. Thanks Jeff.
u make a lot of sense my friend...keep up the good work... :) god bless... yake take care...
Tough love is the best love.
Basically. If you eat shit you will look like shit. Eat Good Natural food, and you will look good.
move out then...ecusese
I stopped eating a lot of that stuff and still can't drop these last 10lbs. The struggle is real.
A-M-E-N !
I don't like protein powder I feel like for many years before it people have been just fine. I don't like many people having it as a necessity in their diet  recommendation.
Sir, Thank you for putting this video up and being very up front and straight!  This really lit a fire under my ass to make the changes I needed too.  I've been following this to the best of my knowledge and ability.  I'm going to continue to watch your videos and visit your website.  I'm at 198lbs down from 235lbs.  And that is only with in three weeks.  I also cut everything out except one coffee a day and the rest water.  Thank you again and please continue with the videos.  God Bless.
Lol @ 11:51
yeah take that vegans and their "healthy" diet
I don't understand, are you trying to say chicken tenders are unhealthy? or Is it not as healthy as the breast.
Constantly looking at those elbows, he Doest extend his arm.. Will the skin on his biceps tear if he'd stretch out his arm?
i love this guy!!
what about gatorade instead of water?
IIFYM
Thanks man , helps a lot!  ✔
hi,I am from turkey.happy to follow your videos.
what are your thoughts on carb cycling?
Could you recommend a LACTOSE FREE protein supplement, i have significant intolerance to it (not allergy)
Jeff your freakin awesome!
he cant tell us how to get a six pack because he doesn't even have one
I eat pizZa rolls for a living, is that bad?
can i still eat cereal
Ah man, RANT ON. If they can't hear your passion well...You are the man. Thanks for your info. Can you also speak to estrogenic compounds in some foods? I'd love to hear your take on that. That is a TRUE hidden culprit of aiding in the production of cortisol.
thanks man. but to be honest it took me some time to find this out. i wish i would off sean this video before. now, its always good to find someone like you to explain this things in a simple way. and also made me think and recap that what im doing is correct.
I find that I have a lot of trouble following these steps, not because I have no willpower or cannot control my eating habits and simply relapse after every small amount of improvement that I make but, I am 15 and live with my family who do not eat well at all. The meals my mum cooks are healthy and balanced but portion sizes are simply too large. My family constantly complain how they want to be thinner and I tell them never to use the word diet and that a complete lifestyle change is in order. They also prohibit me from using any type of supplements as they think they are like drugs and if I tried to explain otherwise they would get seriously pissed off and not talk to me for days. I just want to eat the way I feel is correct but that just doesn't seem to be possible in my current situation, any advice?
Very honest and I really appreciate that.  Pushing good advice and encouragement instead of supplements etc.  Hits the nail on the head so many times.  Step one is the hardest part but the one that no one wants to give up.  Thank you for honest truth.
You ARE a tough arse!!!
Yeah! F*ck the macros.
This has become my favorite channel on YouTube
Damn! No sugar=(
Hi I drink roughly 3 to 4 ltrs of water a day, is that enough?
thank you brother i get started to your plan and im sure it will help me :)
I'm somewhere between Step 3 and 4  I'm on a low calorie deficit right now to lose the weight and gut.
i found this pill that allows me to eat pizza 3 days per week and also u can have some drinks during weekends.
Eat more often? Does this also count when you're trying to lose fat and  are going for abs at the same time?
What about coffee? I drink 4-6 (8-12 oz) cups per week. Always black and always freshly ground.
Thanks Jeff. No one else puts out such consistent, high quality training and nutrition advice as you.
This is by far the best video for getting abs on YouTube.
Where's my macros?
good shit bro
Thanks man. Thank you for the simplicity of learning how to get a lean six pack, and not talking about all of that keeping you macros crap! I love to go work out every morning. and eat my healthy meals along with a little something that I like.
As always LOVE THE VIDEOS....but don't "BEEP" shit out. Let us have it!!!!!!!!!!! That's what some of us need...FUCK THE MACROS or whatever it is that you need for us to know. Your videos are awesome because YOU KEEP IT REAL!!!! Don't change that...
Thanks man! This is actually the toughest part for me. I actually train a lot in a boxing gym, and I want to progress but my weight makes me wind off very quickly when I do the cardio stuff or when I spar. I'm tryin to get "all muscle" but it's tough, I have a long history of eating crap and rewarding myself, but I'm getting better. I made a list while listening to this video, and I'm gonna try to stick to it. Thanks again, love your videos!
Those were some honest and wise words. You're the truth man. I appreciate you.
Preach Brother!  Thumbs up.  Cut the bull if you really want something you'll stop at nothing.
dat abs, so jealous .
That's is the truth! I was what they called a skinny fat person, and ever since I changed my bad eating habits and replaced my big meals with eating more frequently and proportionately, I have noticed that my belly fat has gone down significantly.  Keep in mind I was packing a great amount of greens on my plate as well.  Thank you for these amazing videos!
Show us some before pictures.
This guy is brutally honest, he knows that you know the answer to your weight loss issues and struggles.  He tells you to skip the bullshit and simply gives you answers. Subbed.
Jeff, how about a video on neck strength?
Yea and Don't by meat from "Factory Farms" besides the cruelty to animals, its very bad for You! you are consuming all of that unhealthy crap that the animal is being force fed. If the animals  are being given something to make them fatter, you bet your ass its gonna make you fatter too.
great presentation mate. thanks
thank U for poasting THIS!!!
ATHLEAN-X™ I'll get back to you when I get the body I want. Thanks for speaking the truth.
Every single one of your videos are helpful.
Thumbs up for the tough love, it's spot on. :)
Yes! Macros are essential to fitness and training, but I think his message is not to worry about Macros if you don't even have a good diet first. Good diet first, then focus on Macros later. Eventually with a good diet and eating more of the good food like he mentioned, you will get your Macros.
11:05 Nice one!
what about a beer alcohol free?
Okay so question for anyone who is actually in great shape and knows from experience: I do all the things in this video as I am currently cutting weight after bulking up. I reduced my calories I track macros as I find it helpful I eat mainly chicken veggies brown rice brown pasta I get fats from olive oil and peanut butter I've gone from 91kg to 87 kg in a month and a half but now I've hit a stand still. I weight train 3 or more times a week but at the moment have not added cardio. So my question is do I reduce my calories further or add cardio. I'm on about 2200 cals a day and wondering when dose reducing become too much I reduced from 2500 to 2200 as suggested by Www.iifym.com. any solid info would be really helpful
With all due respect to your ideas and philosophy, I believe the information you are giving out works. However, for those of you who cannot sustain such a strict diet all the time, I suggest you check out the channel Kinobody. They promote flexible dieting and workout plans that allow you to spend minimal time in the gym and be able to eat what you like, and still build a great physique.
Real talk! Awesome dude. people that don't know shit about fitness need to watch this video  over and over!
This guy knows his shit, he's not sidestepping anything or trying to sell u some bullshit miracle pill. This is what WORKS.
One of the most realest fitness guy out there! Thanks!
i eat a good amount of fruit all days , is that a prob ?? ( i also eat vegetables and other healthy stuff)
More upper chest video pleeeeeeaaaasee
Love all your videos Jeff. I just started implementing your food plan and purged all the crap off my daily routine. Ive already noticed energy difference. Can you please do a thorough video about nutrition though? I want to understand why you say to mix carbs with protein and if any sugar for your body is good at all. Thanks Jeff.
I don't like this guys body
Dear Jeff, I would like to thank you for this very useful video, I felt a different man after I finished watching it. Great advices, and already started working on it.
why didnt i meet you 6 years ago! Jeff provides the path im taking to make my lifestyle change! thank you!
Two words: paleo diet.
Very good video Jeff!
Exactly jeff is 100% right Its all about consistency and cutting the crap out
Hey Jeff I just wanted to know what's your opinion on protein supplements or creatine hurting your kidneys in the long run? I am 20 years old going on 21 in a few months and at a recent doctors visit he told me to lay off those supplements, although I am healthy as could be. Of course I don't soley rely on the supplements and get my proper intake through food, I probably drink 2 protein shakes (25g) max throughout the day. I just wanted to know your opinion on it or if you had any personal experiences.
I've always wondered how the hell Christian Bale went from his physique in "The Machinist" to (whichever) "Batman". Muscle memory? Makes sense. Personal trainers? Sure. Working out for hours on end? Of course. Paying to have all of his meals prepared for him. Yeah. Steroids? Who knows?
Thanks Jeff...  Great help as always
like throwing a deck chair off the titanic lmao. classic
You're a legend bro,
Calories are calories... If you eat chips that has 1000 calories or eat 10 bananas which add up to 1000 calories, it's the same. The only difference is the nutrients which you can actually get from shakes.
Great video
Don't forget 1a: exogenous testosterone.
Disagree with the "Eat more often" poster. Sure, eating more often might be beneficial as part of an active lifestyle, but a diet is inherently a restriction in some way. Some people function better on many small meals on a diet, while many need their big meals. These big meals then prevent you from eating often if you want to hit a certain calorie goal.  I'd say, hit your calories and/or macros however you please. Some individuality needs to be promoted on a diet.
"F*** the macros!!"  -  you should really consider making a shirt like that.  I would buy it, best line ever lol
Good video.  Regards,
That came out wrong about macros I don't understand the process of it completely that's all not that I disagree with fn the macros ha haaa
Once again thank you for the knowledge and motivation wooooo!!! F%$k the macros..... I'm still trying to figure out exactly what the f*?k that's all about. You are abs.....olutley right about knowing what it is to cut out. I'm working on it more and more. I found that by eating more often and training hard I was making progress. Then when I ate less I was really making progress. Then I started just eating whatever because I convinced myself I'll burn it off. Then my energy left the building and I started slacking a bit on cardio I was doing and missing workouts. Then a few pounds came on on weigh in day. Then back to less food more workouts. Now I have been trying intermittent fasting. I don't know if it's for me. I like to eat so I've mixed it up a bit. Trying the best of both. Do the fasting thing and only trying to eat dinner and a little fruit smoothie or some hard boiled eggs big ass salad type things and lots n lots of water. Then 3 days later I'll eat every couple hours through some carbs in there and I seem to have kind of plateaued with weight loss. I used to do an hour of cardio after weights hard and it worked for me but now I'm doing intervals for 10-15 min mostly 10 after weights and I'm not sure it's enough. My heart rate gets in the 170s which it never does during long cardio. I'm stuck just trying this and that and back to this then back to that but this video made me realize I know what works the most and that its me and my thinking that has gotten in the way of the huge results I was attaining. I know what to do and I know what works for me so I'm back on track just from watching this rant and commenting. I answered my own questions.  Thanks Jeff
Awesome Post Jeff and love the honesty.  We need more people like yourself in the industry pushing realistic and TRUE nutrition.  Forget worrying about caloric intake and whether today you had 50g more protein or whatever, but eating in a relatable and realistic way with real foods.  There is so much variability in the caloric counting method which make it an inaccurate diet choice anyway.   Keep up the awesome work Jeff
everything in moderation its okay to have a little debbie snack cake every once in a while
I like to drink hot chocolate every night while Im reading,should I stop drink it?? :(
One question: Does mean cut the crap, that i cant go out drinking sometimes? Im very slim by default (weight 60kg at 183cm height before i started with any sport) and while i would like abs, no drinking at all does not seem worth it. I want to take that nice new body out for some partys too ^^.  Also creatin: Love that shit. Started taking it just 2 months after starting to go to a Gym and within 1-2 weeks i felt that i somehow had more power for more sets. :D
Hahaha! "F--- the macros"
This guy always gives the best advice on fitness
No more Häagen-Dazs vanilla swiss almond on Fridays then :( Been a Battle trying to morph my four pack to a six pack
I disagree about the juice. Fresh made juices - concentrating on veggies, are the best things you can "eat."
Do steroids help to get 6 pack?
I love you<3:$:-*@-}--
I  love you
we luv you jeff
"eat more often" is the most difficult for me because i feel food when im trying to do ab exercises for a whole 1.25 hours after eating a medium and large sized meal, and i only have an 8 hour window to eat meals on my fasting diet
First video I've seen of this dude... He tells it straight, no bullshit and didn't sugar coat it. Instant subscribe.
dem biceps tho...
soo.... is it bad to have one cheat meal every Saturday? like a 70% dark chocolate brownie?
fuck the macros guy, honestly if i have to hear that one more time, i am gonna puke.                                                                                        -professor Athlean-X
Great video and advice Jeff! I'm working on building my discipline to cut the crap. Not in it for the abs, but the discipline.
Gracias Senor I like it....
This guy is the man, one of the few people who really seem to convey the 'truth' (even though he advertises, but that's totally understandable)...keep up the good work dude!
Nice one (Y)
Lol whoa!!! "F*ck the macros!!". But I just bought this food scale lol.
Hahaha FUCK MACROS HAHAHA
Hey Jeff just a quick one am a freestyle kickboxing I want to strip the fat and tone muscle but I want to be the weight that I am any tips  ( want to be the  weight that I am as am at top of the food chain as a fighter )
Na food has always been a fuel, money on the other hand... thats a reward :)
Can you make a video about the negative impacts of alcohol on building your body?
Jeff is the greatest, I've been with you for all these years! Always great! Ps: one of the only fitness channels I watch nowadays! Keep it up man
Mmm lasagna
Proper advice.. Thanks!
"F*** the macros!" made me laugh my ass off! XD anyways, ya mentioned oats and crap, I wonder why no one mentions buckwheat, ever! It has like 57% RDA Magnesium per 100g! That's a shitload of Magnesium! The Russian Army feed the soldiers a lot of buckwheat, and they're pretty fit, I personally think buckwheat is like an extremely important forgotten food that no one thinks about...
Great video Thanks! The nly problem I am really struggling with is the water drinking... I tend to drink about 500 - 750ml when training and after, but rest of the day find it very difficult and sometimes water makes me nauseous. Anyone else have this problem?
I am 213 in weight an and 5'10 in height I'm trying to lose  40  or 30 pounds for boxing with in two months what can I do ??  .help
Jeff , I love the dedication you have for the people that follow you. I thanked you before and I thank you again and I will keep thanking you! preciate it always. Oh , and I'm just starting my second week with Ultimate Arms! What a killer workout. I...I...can't even type anymore! Peace!
You should do a video using you workouts and diet plans with me and document it so the followers can see how they work on some that isn't in the best shape.  Seeing is believing.
Can fruit make you fat? If so how much is too much that's like 60 percent of my diet and im not as lean as I thought I would be and im about 9 months working out.
I understand Jeff does these videos to support his brand, but he's as real as it gets with his videos. Tries to be honest and tells it like it is.
where is a good place to find out how much I should me eating?
could you eat cream of wheat to intead of oatmeal? because I dont like the texture of oatmeal for some reason.
Notice how he doesn't mention anything about bulking and cutting. I'm hoping that it will be possible to gain muscle while being in a caloric deficit to achieve a leaner physique
Very helpful video! So far I've already done the first 3 steps, and it's gotten me in much better shape than I originally was in, but I didn't know what to do from there. Glad I saw this, now time to implement steps 4 and 5 :D
Jeff please make a video on the correct ratios between antagonistic muscle groups, thanks!
Jeff, as always loved the video. Very inspiring and exciting!
Hi Jeff, what do you think of the Paleo Diet?
Just so people are aware, IIFYM wasn't invented/stated  to encourage unhealthy eating habits. It was coined on the bodybuilding dot come forums by a guy named Erik Stevens because people would constantly ask, can I eat cereal, can I eat pinapple, can I eat whole eggs etc... Erik got really tired of telling people that if they can fit a food into their caloric budget than it was fine, so it became easier to write IIFYM. If someone is shoving endless donughts into their face while yelling IIFYM, they aren't representing eating via tracking macros, they're representing being a dumbass
consistent excellent content Jeff, been a big fan for a long time and you've helped me so much. Sincerely, thank you
I'm 15 and already following these 5 guidelines and I don't see abs yet? I eat, 100% whole grain cereal, 100% whole wheat bread, grass-fed milk, tuna, salmon, cod, cocao, grilled chicken, kale, broccoli, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, bananas, apples, grapefruit, green tea, and a ton of other healthy stuff and eat it throughout the day. I drink plenty of water, and I supplement with Creatine, Vitamin D and CoQ10, and protein drink.  My abs show if I flex them, but if I don't, my stomach is round. Is it because I have too little ab muscle, or I have too much fat covering it up (I'm relatively skinny -- 115 pounds)?
As I'm watching this my wife just threw a cake in the oven! Aw man!! Temptation!
Jeff, what is your keys to getting rid of the final few %'s of body fat? I'm down to 15.5 % body fat, but I'd like to get to 10%, then go back to building muscle again. I just can't lose any more weight, I'm already going to the gym 5x a week and doing HIIT, too.
funny you mentioned Christian Bale, cause you two actually look alike
ATHLEAN-X™  What supplements do you recommend, whey maybe?
Excellent as always Jeff, I'm telling you, you are the only guy in youtube I would by my supplements from
Thank you so much, Jeff. Your videos are helping me so much.
Hello,  the picture he showed got me thinking: for the past 3-4 weeks i have been training my abs and i see some results but i just realized my goal. i am 17years old i am a skinny guy. i want to grow muscle but i dont have the time to go to the gym . does anyone know about a full plan for home exercises in order to build muscle with diet and everything? (no equipment)
Damn, this was inspirational.
I have a problem with eating alot of fruits can this be effecting my lack of physique due to the high sugars or are those sugars ok cause they come with nutrients
One thing I never understood is wouldn't fried chicken pretty much have about the same amount of protein as any other chicken. Say I buy drumstick from Walmart and fry it is that bad? I always thought that chicken is chicken, and same would apply to any other meats.
Oh boy the fact that you have to explain the obvious (don't eat processed food) but then end with you should supplement (by definition processed / engineered) is just a sad statement about the state of eating disorders... Anyhow - Anybody who does not fully understand the food science and practices it right (steps 1-4) should not even think about supplementing. Somebody who does understand 1-4 already would know how to supplement.
i appreciate the hard work you do Jeff .... i  followed  what you recommended to eat in previous videos ... i was amazed by the results ...and for that i encourage people to drop the junk food and  go for the healthier kind of food ... thanks Jeff for all your efforts and keep up the good work ...
I totally followed the same change with my diet. It was progressive. Now I can't go back. Impossible.
Good video but all this is Captain Obvious stuff.  I already know all this in the vid but I struggle with how much I should eat. As is how many calories. It is possible to eat crap free and clean and still get fat because you eat too much you know. That's the key piece of info I was looking for.
Jeff what do you think about fruit?  Like what fruits should I eat and how many servings a day?
What about eating organic food? Does that help with muscle building and getting a 6 pack?
I can only speak for myself, but I highly doubt, if you're doing it right, you will actually miss the junk food...and I mean the JUNK (Mickey D's) you grab purely for its convenience. Sure there are a couple guilty pleasures I refuse to live without from time to time, but a lot of the crap I cut out of my diet I can't go back to and it has nothing to do with making my abs show. Being healthy was the sole motivator at first, but now most of it is just low quality, horrible tasting (very salty) "food", neither pleasurable or satiable, so there's just no point. The health benefits of avoiding that crap are just icing on the cake now. I guess the moral of the story is commitment.
Thanks man. Very straight forward and well said. It helps to hear!
Jeff what are your thoughts on cycling creatine? I'd also like to hear your opinion on pre-workouts.
Greatest tip you will ever hear in your life: listen to your body.   If you're hungry, eat, coz your body is demanding energy.  If you're not hungry, then don't fucking eat.   Eat healthy, listen to your body, and try to get 1,6-1,8G protein per kg of your body weight and you'll be an athlete within month.  And for the ones who want to lose weight, just cut the shit out and you'll drop at least 5-20 kilos within 1-2 months without even training. Goodluck guys
Legit
Hi guys  I just wanted to share my story about how used to eat junk food almost every day for a long time. I was 180 pounds and i was barely 14. I'm still 14 but I stopped eating all that junk food and started eating healthy all because of the vid Jeff made about "why I'm not going to get a six pack" that vid got me really motivated to stop eating all that shit and start to eat healthier. I also started to get really active for example I started to play football, swim, and sometimes I played basketball and I also started to go to the gym since it's summer where I live. I'm 160 now, I  lost 20 pounds in 1 month and it's all thanks to you Jeff I know I'm still overweight but it's better then being 180 pounds and I just wanted to say that your vids are the reasons why I got so motivated to work out and eat healthy.
Jeff can you make a video going more in depth about burning fat and building muscle at the same time.
Hey Jeff can you do a video on Whey protien vs. Whey protein isolate ?
awesome video jeff
He is So right with not drinking the Juice and noticing its sugar content. watch "FED UP' on Netflix or amazon. it will back up everything this guy is saying.
Pizza are ok.
Hmm If I were to cut out or reduce all the dairy from my diet that should be the extra calories , fat , & sugar that is holding me back.
Is he natty
So.... if i workout, hard.... i do all those steps.... i do really im a bro... i hit macros... with the clean foods.... still..... i know cals in vrs cals out.... but how can i bulk.... without putting so much fat, im just scared of the bulk lol i was a fat kid and thats why 5 years ago i change my eating style.... but i wanna pack some muscle.... still.... i fear dem carbbbs!
Do u eat at night?
You're the man Jeff! of all the people on YT...you're the best hands down IMO. Keep it up, you're helping me to better myself every day. Cheers.
Like these type of videos. Very informative and encouraging. Keep 'em coming Jeff, thanks.
Is a pb and j on wheat bread bad??? Other than that I eat clean. Anyone wanna answer please??
A great message that is not really just for getting great abs, but just simply great advice overall for good eating habits and knowing your priorities.
this is a perfect outline, that allows a person to learn from here.
Gotta love this man's honesty.
You don't need to worry about what you eat.  As long as its in moderation and you do weighted squats and deadlifts every 2nd day.
Cut garbage carbs(cereals,pasta,breads,etc) you got a good chance of leaning out. Eat plants and some meats, exercise and sleep!
I have 24.5% body fat do I need to cut more or do I just build my abs at this point?
13 minutes of truth
is macros just a synomym for meal-planning and counting calories? the internet is full of "how to calculate your macros", but what are macros?!
I cannot wait to need supplements. Thanks Jeff.
Is it worth it to buy the Athlean x program if  U are fat  Can only do 2 pressups Age : 16  ?
I have to say that this TOOO is necessary. Some call it a rant I call it RIGHT ON!!! Take your SHILAJIT, it's gonna be nasty, AND it's good for your body,........ just like truth, funny how that works out too. Thank you for this supplement as well. Just the umph I needed to keep going. KEEP ON RANTING.
I cheat immediately after my leg workout once a week is it okay or should I stop it?
Excellent Jeff, for me I have been following a healthy meal plan for over 2.5 years, I have got abs all year round, I lost the body fat quite quickly from about 20% to under 10% in a few months, however to go 10% to say 6% that has been very difficult, would love to see a video about loosing that extra few percent, not sure what the best approach is
Good vid
How do you feel about cheat days Jeff?
Wish more fitness youtubers would cut that macro shit out too. Hard work and consistency is way more important than macros. i don't count macros but i eat clean and frequently. Lost over 50 Pound in 6 months, and i feel strong energetic and healthy.Started at 293 lbs. now I'm at 239 lbs as of today. ... all hard work and eating clean...fuck macros. If you like your burgers and fries then put in the work and burn it off. Keep it up Jeff and thanks for telling the truth.
wow he said fuck the macros
Awsome 👍👍
Thanks Jeff, great information. I've been struggling with being consistent and this  is a great 5 step plan.
J do u have any thing for height and do hard workout depress height pls answer me i am 17 and only 5.7
Great role model. Great tips
i want to get abs, been eating correctly for 1 month now but i simply hate the gym every time i go in there i feel discouraged because of the other body builders, you need this, stop cardio lift more exedra. o well nothing ventured nothing gained
Can you tell me or make a video on your options on using the Valsalva Maneuver during heavy lifts.
F#@k the macros! Right said Jeff!!!
im so confused
Jeff is the man...
As much as I agree with a lot of what he said. I don't understand why he's against macros, I've been counting macros for sometime and have seen results. Sure healthy foods are better for our organs and all that but in terms of fat loss and muscle building macros work. And sometimes they are good because you can fit some cheats in and that helps you keep your sanity. Now there is no way you can make your macro goals with all junk thats impossible so it'll still be a good enough healthy diet. And having some cheats is good, for sanity, and living you know we only get one life, I ain't eating boiled chicken for the rest of my life fuck that.
Great video! :)
Heya,  My breakfast is 60g oats (biological) cooked in water (no milk at all), 1 tbs honey and usually a banana. Think thats decent?
This is the best nutrition advice ever.Not just for abs but just for health in general.Thanks,Jeff.
Jeff, Great video, huge fan. I'm basically already doing everything in your video an currently at about 11.1% body fat trying to get under 10%, the difference is basically less than 2lbs when you do the math but after having already lost 165lbs in the last 2hrs, I think my body is fighting to hold on to every last lbs of fat harder than ever.   Right now I eat a lot of fruit, mainly strawberries and blueberries, with every meal. I've seen differing opinions on fruit online, one saying to avoid the fructose and one saying basically that if your worried about fruit having an effect on your body fat percentage then you've gone of the deep end and need to focus more on health rather then your body fat percentage because fruit is good for you.   I know, moderation is key but it's difficult with fruit because while my stomach is not hungry, my brain thinks I'm dangerously low on body fat and it seems like I store fat so easily these days, diet overall is in check, basically the Mediterranean diet and I have a resting heart rate of about 44 or 43 beats per minute and do about an hour of cardio nearly everyday to make sure I burn off what my body seems so desperate to store.   Any thoughts pointers tips are appreciated, Btw I lift 4 days a week for about 45 minutes each session and carry around a resistance band to hit mainly shoulders and back (posture correction, tip from one of your videos) almost every day several times a day.   Thanks,   Jesse
Thanks Jeff. Great info, as always!
Thank you for cutting through the bullshit and giving it to us straight. This is the reason I subscribed to your channel. This kind of honest, just doesn't exist anymore. Thanks again Jeff!
Ok imma eat a pizza now!
hey guys quick question: should I take my protein powder with milk or water?
But Jeff what about the macr...  Oh, there he goes puking..... o__O
One of the best Videos I have ever seen about nutrition! Great job, Jeff. Thank you...
Great video
I guess the most important thing is mindset, whether or not you wanna change your lifestyle to reach your goal of the six pack abs.  Being able to control what you eat is easy but to maintain it and change it to your lifestyle is a different story.
ATHLEAN-X™ , could you please make a video about other foods you could cook once a week, like the chicken and tomatoes? Thanks.
Just watched your video on making the changes on food, and your dead right, eat right and drink loads of water and cut out alcohol it's working for me
ATHLEAN-X™ , can you publish videos on other foods that you could prepare on a weekly basis? Like the chicken and tomatoes. Thanks.
You're the best.
LOL Amen bro, Fuck Macros! I will be 41 in 3 weeks and thanks to Jeff's diet above, his work out plans like Athlean X and NXT as well as his videos I have the best abs of my life.  I keep it simple, I do ALL of the above and IT WORKS.  I DO have a cheat meal each week, and in that meal I have wine/ale/spirits and maybe a small dessert so I'm not perfect. But Jeff knows his shit, i mean just look at him.  It's not rocket surgery, keep it simple, stick with it, you will get the results Jeff's talking about ;)
Are pancakes ok? I love me some pancakes with my eggs in the morning.
This video was great! Jeff really knows his stuff
What's your take on the military diet ?
Regarding step one.. After considering my diet, the only thing I question is my breakfast choice. I eat cereal for breakfast (Kashi Go Lean - Original). Would you consider this a bad thing to throw out?
Thanks Jeff. I was about to skip gym today but it seems i did not have any excuse.
Excellent advice.
We dont need macros we re freaks
"Fuck the macros"-Jeff  Fighting off Bro-science since 2009
Are the V8 fusion juices good for you? Also I can't afford the gym since I am 16 but was wondering if I can still see results without it?
Jeff,  What foods are best on the go?  I drive truck every day and it's very difficult to eat healthy all the time.  Any ideas?  I know supplementation can only take you so far.
"You had a chocolate sundae cause you got to work on time"  damn funny stuff.
Yes, I am an Athlean X customer. But this is yet another FREE video with absolutely PRICELESS advice delivered with sincerity and depth.  I did not take this as a rant Jeff.  I took this as a simple wake up call to follow.  I'm now a month over 55 years of age and am struggling through the Ultimate Arms program.  My soreness is at the highest level perhaps ever.  But maybe this video will help me through it because fueling these workouts may be the missing link for me.  Thank you for helping me make positive life changes.  Sam Jackson
What the hell are these macros?
Thank you for the constant motivation and education, Jeff!
I'm not sure about the fruit juice... Yeah, it has some sugar in it, but it's healthy and has vitamins. Some juices are pretty bad, but the "fresh" juice i think it's fine. (of course nothing replaces water)
Another fine video Jeff, you're keeping fitness fanatics informed on the little things and those add up!
Awesome video, Jeff. Keep up the great work!!!
What about people That already have this down packed and eat clean day in day out. You always talk about the beginners.    Jeff there are such things as plateaus for fat Loss,  do u incorporate a carb up day to spike your metabolic rates,  but no not shit carbs like starchy,  complex,  ect.....
Can you do a video on how to maintain a diet while fasting in Ramadan?
Awesome stuff jeff, you are my favorite person on youtube because you are very informative and truly cute through the bull shit. Im in the BEST shape ive ever been in just by having you as a mentor. NOW the one thing I find myself doing and know its a very bad thing is I dont drink enough water thoughout the day, more so when im working out. I know I need my water, I just sometimes dont feel thirsty, I could be sweating my ass off working out but I never get to that point of where I feel like im going to pass out do to over worked system. Could you make a video of what im actually doing to myself (inside) by not drinking water and expending all my fluids.
I got rid of the 163 pound but now I have a lot of loose skin do you have any suggestions for that
What happens when you are doing all these things but still have unwanted fat hiding your abs. I find tracking macros helpful and that when I don't I tend to overeat or undereat.
Best channel and spokesperson on YouTube for real talk fitness. Need more for his and less of the fitness fluff rampant on YouTube.
JEFF YOU'RE WRONG EVERYONE DOES HAVE ABS, THEY'RE JUST USALLY COVERED BY FAT. I know bad joke you most likely know this but simplify it for other folks. Note i haven't watched the whole video yet. Fun fact long ago i weighed 88kilos i just cut soda and candy and sugar generally out of my diet, after that i lost 20 kilo in 6 months. 1 year 26 kilos totally after that i trained 10 kilo of muscle upon that, i haven't actually trained that much or been consistant with training but i just don't need to be that musclular i like my body. I don't know why i am writing this.
Yet another great video. Thank you sensei. You are close to milion subscribers. You deserve it! Best coach on intermet
So soooo true... thx!
Jeff I travel internationally as well as throughout North America - I take my blender and supplements with me whenever I can. How about a segment on what you pack for a five day trip away from your home based!
FUCK THE MACROS!!!
It's my 18th birthday on Sunday and I plan to  go out for a meal. I kind of want to eat a crap tonne there as I've been keeping up a strict consistent diet plan for the last three or four months but I'm not sure if I should. Would that be cool do you think or should I keep it clean
A great way to start is replacing artificial foods with more natural products.
Nice one Jeff we know what the right thing to do is just do it. Thanks coach.
thats some tough true love right there. great vid jeff!
Jeff man you're so right...I trained but ate a lot of crap thinking it wont matter because I did so much cardio but that wasn't working I had abs but I wasn't lean as i wanted to be ...then I started to throw out fast food,chocolate,soda and started eating clean like chicken,rice,salad,tuna and eggs results were crazy.And you're right about the supplementation because I got abs but lost a little muscle in the process so I took supplements and now I'm in the best form I've ever been and you're also correct about the macros...just make sure you're eating the healthy food, working out and doing cardio consistent you're going to have great results I found this myself on my own through trial and error but Im glad we share the same opinion.Thumbs up for this video!
Haha f*** the macros I like it
Great video, Jeff. the only reason I'm still working out for the past 1 year is because when I look in the mirror, I'm not satisfied, and I'll keep working my ass off until I'm satisfied(but won't stop there, though). I have a question: I know my protein intake isn't good enough for me to grow muscles or lose fat(can't afford supplements as they cost $100 for 5lbs. here in India and eating chicken or any other meat for 3 times, too, costs a lot for me), so what should I do to look the best I can? My focus is to lose the extra fat and  build muscle. I have still not not lost the extra fat even after a year of improving my diet and weight training. What can I do?
tea is better than water :()
Best way to make oatmeal ?
do you have any before pics? :P
Hey I an vegetarian and can only eat up to eggs and my protein intake is very less am 19 year old wt 89 kg and doing gym for the last one and a half month and started my diet yesterday, so do I have a chance to get abs and how long will I take and yes I do eat in an interval of 2 to 3 hrs.
Do you have any suggestions for a second and fourth meal (between breakfast and lunch, then lunch and dinner). Also how can you develop the upper chest with body weight exercises?
I love the macros part.
@ATHLEAN-X  OJ is good to have if its 100% natural, and with pulp is even better. Also i find having two cups of Green Tea is great to help keep the metabolism going to burn more fat
Jeff, does chewing gum helps you to give good speech ?  Cause I have noticed that you had one in your mouth
Amen lol
Common sense and discipline - Two dying traits. Must be all that fluoride in the water!
He say that you should only drink water, I only drinl milk, only time I drink water is in my training, i do this to hit my protein intake for the day,is it bad to onlydrink milk? Is it better to only drink water
Cardio, strength training and diet..only way u can have what u want with abs been 3 weeks this Sunday and working great
This is also overcomplicating it, the thingthat makes you lose weight is if you are in a caloric deficit, so just eat less than you normaly do
I watch alot but damn your neck is long af
You are truly an inspiring person Jeff. You are definitely one of the best if not THE best fitness guy here on YouTube. I just bought your ultimate arms program and am 3 days in and can say that it's truly challenging my body in ways I never have and I've been training for about 4 years.. We appreciate everything you do and keep it up!
fuck the macros!!!!! LOL tooo funny
"F*ck the macros." -- finally someone besides me said that! I too am sick of these so called bodybuilder vloggers who think you can eat whatever crap you want so long as you meet your macros. There's more to it than meeting your macros!
You still get muscular from eating unhealthy and working out but you won't be as big without eating healthy so after your diet got strictly healthy about how long did you start seeing improvement ?
I stopped taking creatine because I couldn't sleep. My body couldn't shut down. Has anybody else had this experience?
ATHLEAN-X™ Next do a video on your workout schedule... I NEED TO KNOW! What days do you rest (if any). How long is an ideal workout day etc.
people still haven't grasp the concept that abs are made in the kitchen yet?? I thought by now with all the ab videos that are out there, people would know that a good diet is necessary for getting abs
11:50 Shit just got serious
I love the no bullshit guide!
Good speech brother. I can see you're passionate about your viewers truly changing their lives. I need to step up my game.
Awesome video ! The truth as it is, gentlemen :-)
Great video. Now a few meal prepare videos would be great. :)
Hey y'all, I've been scrawny my whole life and i'm trying to bulk and everything but I'm noticing my stomach is gaining a lil bit of size. I've been a newbie to working out (since Jan.1) and I wanted know what is the best way to bulk. I eat eggs and all that stuff but I would like for my abs to show too if that's possible lol. What foods do y'all recommend?
@jeff or anyone else: I'm eating egg whites with a fruit smoothy in the morning, a light lunch of a small turkey or chicken sandwich or healthy cereal, then for dinner rice with some form of meat or broccoli. How does this sound?
Tell it, Jeff!
F*ck the macros!  I'm getting that on a t-shirt - superb!
have you tried low carb paleo diet?
Excellent tips
"It's like throwing a deck chair off the titanic" haha
Yeah, another Abs video. We didn't get one of those in a LOOOONG time.
"Fuck the macros!" Made me cheer out loud.
Dear jeff what u said was great. I think you need to do another video to teach people how to approach their training if they wanna utilize all what u had said and start seeing the real results !
All your stuff is gold.
Did this when I started my diet 63 pounds down and I'm happier that I ever was
Thanks Coach Cavaliere.
I'm glad you made this rantish vid. It's better to look at it simply. I gained 30 lbs in the last 9 months and had to not work abs for about 7 of those months because of an injury. Since I kept a decent diet I still have lost my abs now that I can work on better defining them. Just had to keep it simple.
Preach!!!!!!!
Glad I watched the whole thing. Lol. "FU** THE MACROS!!"
Athlean, you look like the same US border agent who detained me at the border and sent me back to Canada. Do you have a brother working for the US border services in Buffalo?lolz
Timbahwolffff is laughing right now lol
Any pictures of what u looked like b4 the Spartan physique Jeff?
Weight loss is very easy. If you want a diet that is simple and not over the top but still includes good tasting food, just think: Meat + vegetables = good  Tuna with vegetables(carrots, broccoli, cauliflowers, green beans, spinach, cucumbers, onions, peppers, zucchini, just whatever you like) Other seafood with vegetables(shrimp, trout, salmon, etc) Grilled chicken with vegetables Steak with vegetables Turkey with vegetables Pulled pork with vegetables Bacon or sausage and eggs  Take those options, mix and match each day so you don't get burnt out like most people do who try to eat chicken and broccoli for every meal, and add in a protein shake in between meals to keep you going. Stick to those kinds of meals(WITHOUT any rice or potatoes) drink only water, plain black coffee,  plain tea, and you WILL lose weight.
jeff how do i avoid overtraining if i lift but also train MMA/Muay Thai/Basketball? how do i continue do build muscle and burn fat? thank you
Great video!
Do a video on IIFYM
Jeff can you make a video about veganism
I follow iifym if it fits your mouth
Where does he say fuck macros
Good rant. Give up the juice. Right. But, I'm telling you that it is not so much the sugar that is the problem as it is another ingredient that is in everything from juice, to ice cream, to sodas even bread. It is so pervasive in food that it is one of the most overlooked ingredients that can cause major fat gain. I'm talking about corn syrup. AKA corn syrup sweetener. You see, while the liver can deal with sugar and turn it into energy fairly quickly (sugar rush) corn syrup is the bigger enemy to losing fat. Why? Because the liver cannot turn that into energizing sucrose near as fast as it can sugar. And what isn't turned into energy is turned into fat. So not only is the liver trying to deal with 50+ grams sugar in a single can of soda or a glass of juice there is that innocent sounding corn syrup that's added in there as well. Thankfully people are becoming more informed on this fat gainer and companies like Coke and Pepsi are again selling products with just sugar. Although it's still a good idea to avoid those sugar laden products like the plague, and give that liver a break from all the overtime it puts in trying to process that stuff. I know you may not agree with me, but I started taking a one day fast only this week. No food, only water with lemon (organic) and organic Stevia to sweeten it with. So at least one day a week the liver gets a chance to rest, detox and "reboot" as it were so that it can tackle the work load with a lot more efficiency. Which means, for one thing, better sugar processing as well as doing a more efficient job of getting toxins out of the blood. Which means more efficient fat burning and more efficient muscle growth. Another thing I have done is to stop buying that Wal-mart crap and have gone back to your ATHLEAN-RX supplements. That Six Star Wal-mart stuff only helps to gain fat and the cheap made protein...well, you've already done a rant on that one. Hehehe. I tried that Arnold Schwarzenegger pre-workout and it was the absolute worst. It didn't give me more energy or more pumps but actually stole energy from my workouts and made me feel weak and short of breath. I stopped using it and when I got my ATHLEAN-RX order I chucked that stuff in the trash. You don't really get a deal with that Wal-mart stuff anyway. It had to be replaced every two weeks or so. The ATHLEAN-RX protein comes packed all the way to the lid and actually lasts a whole month! Good, clean protein means your body can use it more efficiently and without all the unnecessary fillers and added stuff that the body can't use anyway. Now that's a bargain I can live with! Last month my body fat analysis was at 23.1% and am having it analysed again next week. Can't wait to see how it turns out because I can already see the results in the mirror or when I'm sitting and look down at what used to be a big gut, but now there is wrinkles and a flap of skin hanging over my belt due to the fat shrinkage. I hope that gets tightened and toned up eventually though. LOL. Okay, that's my rant and I will give an update on how my body fat analysis turned out. Later  Okay, here's the update results of today's BFA. 22.2% Yay!
Great informative vid as always Jeff.  Any chance we can get a dunkin donuts era Jeff photo?  Just curious as to what it looks like kinda hard to picture ha
I'm glad that you pointed out the bad side of juice. Most people assume that it's good for you because of the whole "eat fresh fruits and vegetables!!" craze... but what people fail to realize is that juice is nothing but flavored sugar water. I've read that with some brands of juice, 1 cup of apple juice = 8 apples. You mine as well be drinking a can of Pepsi in place of juice. The same goes for milk, the milk ad campaign is brilliant at convincing people that it's healthy and good for you, but if you look at the ingredients, the most prevalent one is yet again.... sugar. Drink water, black coffee with no additives, and tea with no additives and you will be much better off.
Haha FUCK THE MACROS!
"F#@k the macros." Well said 👏🏽😌
is gatorade an improvement from "juice"?
He just went over the last six months of my life. 4 days ago i started to eat a lot more, due to eating 4000+ cal and still was loosing weight and missing out on some gains muscle. Don't even count my macros anymore.
ATHLEAN-X™ what do you think of v8? is it good for you or not?
You should do a vid comparing the 2 diet mindset clean eating and if it fits your macros and show which one you think is best and what benefits/negatives you have?
Another good video.   Keep them coming.
Brilliant Jeff.
I have spent my entire adult life being physically active and focused on eating healthy. The IF eating structure just plain works for me and I do eat clean. I actually really enjoy the daily fasting, my workouts don't suffer at all and I think their are other benefits other than the calorie control. The eating small meals all day just drove me insane. At 42 I am in the best shape of my life and I will not look anymore into any other ways to eat.
Could you do a transformation video of yourself
<---Soda-less since 2007. It all started from a break-up.
great video keep it up !!!
F**K THE MACROS, HAHA
Step one is the most difficult one for me. Not because I buy a lot of junk food but because I live in a Hispanic household in which my mother make food that consist a lot of oil. Whenever I tell her to start cooking healthy she doesn't take me seriously and just chuckles. But since I'm working this summer I'm going to be buying my own food with my own money. Hopefully this time I can actually stick with it and see the result.
The question isn't how to fill my calories, it's how to do so while feeling full! I could seriously eat 100 scoops of peanut butter before being slightly full, whereas a couple handfuls of cashews fills me up pretty good.  It's weird, because things like oatmeal have never really filled me up. Maybe my ghrelin/leptin levels are messed up.
I have been trying to fine tune my diet for a while now and let me tell you, this works. I have increased the weight I can lift AND gotten lean. Thanks for another sick video!
dude your content is so good. Thank you. Im surprised vegan gains hasnt attacked this channel and yes FUCK THE MACROS
I love this guy! LOL. FUCK THE MACROS!
ATHLEAN-X™  Hi Jeff. I just purchased AX1 last night and looking forward to using it. I have a question in regards to food. After working out, I usually go to Chipotle for a post-workout meal (burrito bowl - plain white rice, black beans, pico de Gallo, medium salsa and guac), I wanted to know if what I get is good to lose fat or if I need to change it in any way or if Chipotle is not the best choice? Thanks.
do a video on inner thigh workout for mass that you can do at home
Great video, thanks.
ATHLEANX where we not only train like an athlete but talk like one too fuck the macros :D
Love it ..
Getting excess alcohol out of my diet... not possible! I work out to look good while drinking pretty much so that's not gunna work.
There's nothing wrong with counting macros. It helps you make sure you are hitting the calorie limit you have set and making sure you are getting enough of each macro, which is what your body needs.  Plus keeping track of macros makes it easier to have a cheat meal without it destroying you. Flexible dieting is a great thing and works.  So saying "Fuck the macros" is not good advice. It's kind of stupid really. It may not be required, but for some of us it helps and makes things a lot easier.
What about some sloppy joes? That's not considered crap, is it?  It literally looks like shit, but it's so fucking good!!  Breakfast of champions, right?
Please can you do a video on teen that work out and if weight lifting stunts growth.I really need to know
That's was deep Jeff, I worship you now
Why would Jeff make a diet plan video for free when he charges for this service as PT? Some points are true but he doesn't explain them well intentionally and this is because it's free! You DON'T have to eat clean as long as you hit your caloric intake for the day. Just eat low fat food and hit your protein intake. Simple! Oh and carbs are GOOD. There isn't a number of meals you must eat, do whatever work for you. If you're serious about it, you should consider weighing your food. It will help you tremendously to work out the calories (track them using apps like myfitnesspal, obviously) but you're going to have to be consistent. Also, use a excel spreadsheet  to track your diet and to see what works and the trends (line graphs help). Jeff doesn't explain how to 'eat more' and this misleading information may lead to people putting on a lot of weight instead! The techniques is called Reverse Dieting where a person increases their daily caloric intake in small increments of 100-150 a week AFTER their cut to reach a NEW maintenance (obviously, its going to be less). This is done to raise your metabolism back up with minimal fat storage. Your cut should be a 10-30% deficit. The more you're in a deficit, the more strength and muscle you will lose. While cutting, you shouldn't go below your BMR, this means you shouldn't do a 30% deficit if your not very overweight. Cut back on volume and do low reps, heavy weight to maintain strength. Hope this helps everyone who reads this (if you've got this far lol)
great video
Haha ironic I see the "I love french fries ad" while trying to watch this :P
This was real helpful. Thank you!
DO A TEEN WORKOUT PLAN!!!
Great video.  Very straightforward.
Man I commented on one of Jeffs videos on how important diet is to get and maintain 6 pack abs and everyone went crazy on me, because the video was about an exercise.. Diet is way more important than sit ups!!
This was extremely disappointing. How about a discussion on how quickly to cut calories?  The title of the video is a Diet Plan - funny how there isn't even a discussion on how to configure and tweak a diet as you progress in your development.
Great video.
Fuck the macros! FUCK!! THE!!! MICROS!!!
Lol absolutely love the rant videos. You should do more of em. Also please speak about shin splints.
Jeff C's No-Bro Approach! "Fuck the MACROS!!"

"Fuck a macros"...classic
So, if you have too much body fat you shouldn't use supplements?
this is the only way to get abs... you're my favorite guy on YouTube...

All good advice. It's not the macros why you're failing, it's the twinkies and coke.
