My friend just gave me this pressure washer, clean both my cars today, if I put the turbo nozzle, is it strong enough to clean my house/garage siding?
Can you use Krud Kutter in soap dispenser
Thanks for the video
Have you had a problem with trigger handle connector stripping? I had to buy a new trigger handle but it doesn't connect to the hose attached to the machine.  Have any advice.  Ryobi is useless
is there any reason you can't put bleach in the soap container?
I pulled one of these out of my neighbors trash because it wouldn’t power up and it ended up being the GFCI plug. I went on Amazon and replaced the plug and now it works perfectly! I love using mine to clean the car as well as getting rid of debris out of the gutters
This just a water hose
Thank you so much for your help
My Guy,!!! Started Assembly before discovering the INSTRUCTIONS, lol. Thinking about getting one of these... How do u like it so far? Thanks, 👍🏾👊🏾✌🏾🇳🇬🇺🇸
Bought this for myself in April of 2019, used it about 10 times to wash my car. By January of 2020 the handle started to leak, couldn't wash my car without getting my shorts soaked. Ryobi says they have a 3 year warranty...bullshit. They will not honor thier warranty, they told me to buy a new wand. I'll never buy another product from them. Save yourself the headache and frustration,  don't buy from Ryobi!!!
Only problem is you were to explain how well does it work with nozzles. Could have shown how the soap nozzle works. We didn't need to see you clean your whole trailer.
Fucking thank you
Where to connect our water hose, you didn’t mention that
Aloha, great video!  Is the soap nozzle just to apply the soap?  Also which nozzle is good for the house, no sidings, and which one for car?  Thanks!
Thank you for the video. I just picked one up. I was looking for a pressure washer at Home Depot and saw this one. Before I purchased it I watched a few videos right there in the store and yours was the best.
Has it lasted these past 4 years?
Nice review and tutorial. So how well did it hold up?
hello, you can explain the amount of soap that can be put in the container of the pressure machine
good video
Just got mine and needed help. Thank u
Can you downstream with this?
SOLD.  im about to go to HD and  buy one now !!
What is the number of the blue one?
Great while it lasted. Only lasted about 50 hours over 11 months
Great video, like the fact you showed the assembly even though I'm sure it was a piece of cake. Great job. Also, nice yard, seems nice and peaceful over there.
Have you used it to trim grass around a metal fence? Is it strong enough to cut grass?
*Well built product, easy to set up and use.>>>**t.co/8V6sKyOf5o**  Did a great job on removing grime from pavers and retaining walls. Would highly recommend*
Nice review but its seems like not enough pressure tho
How is it holding up after 2 years? Any broken parts or quality complaints?
Great Review, I appreciate it! How long does the battery last and how long does it take to charge up the battery? Thanks!
Have the same one. Always acts like it's sucking air. Any advice?
Can you put car soap into the soap part of the machine? Have you washed your car with this or is it to strong for car paint?
Lonnie, very nice video.  It gave me a very good idea of how one of these work.  Question: ¿is this pressure washer too powerful for washing a car?  ¿Will it damage the paint?  Any comments & concerns are very much welcomed.  Thank you for making and posting this instructive video.  td.
By the time the 3 min hit , I already washed my car and dryed it using the green works that already has wheels attached.
Shouldn't you bleed the air before turning on?
Excellent instructions !!! You saved me, I can't understand those directions in the box :0)
