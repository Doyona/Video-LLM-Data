Thank you. 👌💕
Hi Geoff , I remember my mum making malt loaf when I was young, I’m 64 now so almost 60 years ago.  I distinctly remember that it had ‘all bran’ in the recipe. It was also darker too.  I think you could achieve the darker shade with a bit of gravy browning though.  Very good vlog.  Thank you xx
Ex Baker? So am I. Worked with an atmosphere of flour dust for 30 years. Result: COPD sufferer. Sounds like Geoff might have the same problem?
What is the best temperature for baking it
Hi Geoff, Is this loaf the same as the Veda that was sold in Ireland? I loved it,  it was not a sticky loaf and did not have sultanas in it. I remember when sliced as kids we would squeeze the sides of the centre of bread and make a shape resembling a lady the centre being her waist and the rounded shape of the top of the bread was her head, then the bottom formed the skirt. It was so playable and did not crumble.  The reason for all this information is to see if you may be able to re-create this loaf.  I live up the gulf of the Eyre peninsula on the fringe of the desert in South Australia. I would certainly like once more to taste this bread, too old to go back to Ireland.
Made this yet again today. Substituted the mixed fruit for dates and walnuts, it's even better.
Made this today and I'm so very grateful...its absolutely stunning thanks Geoff :)
Would this work without the fruit?
I just made this, it's the closest to Soreen I've managed to get. Best recipe yet.
Can't wait to try this one. My husband loves Soreen.
Would anyone be able to convert this to Imperial measurements. I don't have a clue about metric. Thanks
Great video love and it a thumbs up and bells on
Hi Geoff, where do I buy malt extract?  Where would it be in a supermarket?
Can molasses be substituted for the black treacle?
Hello Geoff from Australia 🇦🇺 my mother thanks you very much. It tastes Devine! X
Gorgeous Geoff some butter on a slice and a cup of tea very nice recipe Thankyou 😊
I haven't heard of this recipe. Interesting....thanks for sharing 😊
Thanks for the interesting video.    You can stick with this recipe for a long, long time.   Keep the oven hot and keep loafing.
That looks so delicious! Thank you for sharing this wonderful old-fashioned recipe.
