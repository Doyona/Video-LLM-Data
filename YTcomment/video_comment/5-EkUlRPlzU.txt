The green seasoning link is not working this year 😢
CAME OUT SO GOOD IM HERE FOR THE LORD KNOWS HOW MANY TIMES
Still watching 2025
I love the other recipe but I didn’t enjoy the coconut flavor in this one.
Port wine ,or sherry is better.
Came out great easy to follow, I would like to know how to thicken the sauce a little after the oxtail are cooked.
Oxtail is a labor of love 💗
Oh gosh Uncle Chris I want some of that delicious oxtail
I'm going to try some of these recipes 😋
Love it
Hands down tbe best cooking channel on youtube
This is truly my favorite recipe for oxtails.
"If it goes black shut everything thing down and start over".😂😂😂😂😂😂
You are wonderful  thank you for the food I'm new on your youtube thank you
Is according to how old the animal was. I love this guy.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💖
I’ve been following this recipe for over 4 years and no one can top it lol thank you for still having this here! You’re much appreciated 🤎
Looks delicious Chris will love to give this a try can you please let me know on what the paste is and what seasonings you mix together to make the paste and how to make it cannot wait to try this but that's the thing I'm waiting on many thanks
Yummy! Mouth is watering. Thank you for the recipe
5 years later and this recipe still slaps !! Never fail with this one
I just realised how irish tribidadians sound…
hollo iam very happy
I made this for my girlfriend after dating for a few months. She’s with me 5 years later and I still think this is why.
I don’t like peeling the ginger and all that Jazz 🤣🤣🤣
Try using a pressure cooker. Takes 1/3 the time. The flavors stays in the pressure cooker. Try it man.
Y’all should also know that covering a boiling pot with a lid will slowly evaporate the liquid but will tenderize the meat.. removing the lid on a boiling pot will evaporate the juice much quicker but does nothing for tenderizing the meat..
Back in the early 80's, oxtail and chicken wings were cheap, seriously cheap.  I lived on those things while in college.  Then people figured out they were really good and the prices went way up...
Never seen oxtail with coconut milk,but will definitely try it. Looks great.
“I want that Caribbean sunshine” love it!
You forgot to include ginger in the list of ingredients.
Can I do this without the green paste or would I be missing out??!
This is my favorite way to make oxtails thank you for this recipe!!!!
Man I always burn the sugar
Nice recipe

I have to use a pressure cooker, I’m impatient
Is this really got? I see the Scotch Bonnet pepper listed. Is there an alternative if those aren't in our area? Also How hot does it make the dish?
I’m making this recipe as I am typing this post. I can’t take it too hot so I will take the Scott bonnet out after 1 hour. I can’t wait to eat. I made white rice and cabbage the African way, you know with the grated ginger and garlic and multi colored peppers. Thank you Chef for sharing your recipes. My apartment smells like a Jamaican, Carribean, African restaurant. My Hat is off to all of us awesome cooks. God bless you and the rest of us too❤️❤️❤️❤️

I’m try this next week
I made this for dinner today & omg it was sooo good! I can't wait to see if it tastes even better the next day :-)  Thanks for sharing
Why use ketchup? I've seen so many people use it, but I think the flavor gets lost once cooked.
Greetings from Cape Town, South Africa. I'm making your dish right now. Half way through and it's looking great. Thanks
What is in the green seasoning. Where can i get it :)
Yum!!!! I can not wait to try this
Tell us the seasons in the green pack. In USA and dont know what you use
Tried this recipe out yesterday and it was amazing 😋😋😋😋😋
Good eating.
Wow. Gotta’ do this.
THANK YOU  SO MUCH  Just  made your recipe  for my love's birthday dinner and it turned out GREAT
A one know where I can get a pot like that in NYC?
I made this with oxtails and it was amazing also added carrots . I’m now 19 days vegan and will be recreating this dish tonight can’t wait 😊
Hi do you have a recipe for the Caribbean green seasoning? Do you think the pressure cooker gives it a different taste?  How would you describe the coconut milk taste and why do you use it?
Love your cooking. Just made this recipe except I grilled the oxtails. Happy Birthday 🎂
3 years later I still follow this recipe.
Your food gives me the shivers
Made my day many thanks from U.K.
New to this channel and I'm loving it 🙌🏾😋
can i use boxed coconut milk ?
Not too sure about that coconut milk, otherwise great recipe!
dam my mom on vacation and im here
Love Oxtails. Never put Coconut milk in it. Will try the Coconut milk in.
1:07 pauuuuuuuuuse
We Jamaicans season totally different 😂🇯🇲 where is the butter beans?🤔😂
I tried making oxtail and it has a bitter taste. I added sugar thinking it would help and it looks so light in color. I was told not to use any more browning because it would make it more bitter. what should I do?
My kine of chef clean an kno how to cook.
New York I never cooked Caribbean food I am pilipino n my family went crazy now my kids always request this dish keep cooking I been watching your show for many years Thanks
Waay bio ketchup in stew beef not beef schew  all you is reel boss  in dee konna wit all you proppa English hahahaha bahahahaha
The brown sugar part is always tricky for me, but it’s worth it even if you have to start over 😭
Aww man @9:12, I do not want to think about how old my animal was before I eat it.
Second time making this (after the first was such a hit)! Thanks for the recipe, Chris. Keep em' coming!
Oh yeah my brother over the recipe  thank you much love peace god bless!
Just made this and it’s soooo goooood, I can’t even believe it 😩😩
oxtail is the best meat I like it
I subscribed beacuse you said i dont peel ginger... i dont peel it either. good cooking sir
This is off the topic and I know the video is old but I love thast hat!! Now, about the video. I'm just getting into tasting oxtails & needed a genuine recipe, so I landed here. Do-able  recipe. Trying this week👍...TY
Man... you da best.  Where can I get one of these pots!😋😋😘😘😘
Website doesn't work uuugghh😩
We have OXTAILcut in fullsegments, sadly this site wont let me post a picture, but where iam this is considered GOD's foof!
I wanna make this time I only have dark brown sugar. Would it turn out bad if I use dark brown sugar?
You helped me so much in the kitchen 😂
I'm doing this for Christmas
Ok. I'm doing this for my next mukbang video. This looks really good. ❤
Outstanding!!! Chris that looks amazing. And the way you explained it . to wasn't that difficult. Just patience is the key to a good stew.
Please make sure that it not kangaroo tail and its oxtails🤔
That's a well-used, seasoned pot!!! 😋😍
Going to try this recipe for the first time today. Wish me luck...
Me belly touchin me back 🔥
Am Kenyan living in Paris trying this tonight. I concurr
Great idea that I'm going to try it using beef shank meat. Love that drumbeat at the end of the video. Thank you!!
I wash with salt, soak in vinegar for 30 minutes, I boil the blood out for about 15 minutes...then I rinse with cold water...then I marinate for 24 hrs with thyme, worsterser, soy sauce, garlic, onion powder, teaspoon all spice, pepper, dab of ketchup, paprika, adobo all purpose seasoning, and browning.....then I fill pot with beef broth, I then sear the meat in olive oil...place oxtails in beef broth...cook veggies in the same pan as oxtails....then add veggies to the pot...add adobo, fresh time and coconut milk.
Light and Grace to you and your family
Could we add turkey necks to this?
Sorry homie those are not real Jamaican Oxtails, they are more of a Trinidadian style.
From the beginning, making the fresh green seasoning, to the very end, my kitchen and house smelled wonderful all day long. I added some potato and sweet potato toward the end to stretch out the recipe for later in the week. Served tonight with rice and peas. Delicious, friend! Thank you for the recipe. That brown sugar technique is a hand-shaking, stressful thing the first time, but thank you for showing it to us!
A master at work
I'm definitely going to try this recipe once it starts getting colder, unless I win that pressure cooker 🤣 but for now it's too hot in Texas to cook oxtails on stove top.
some people say they know they can't believe, I just made some oxtail carribean recipe. It's the one man Chris, and the essey Olbi, latino and carribean gangstah. the tasties of the tastiest of carribean cousine, couldn't find coconut milk so i added cream.
it's not how my mum makes it but I was sitting here watching and I am salivating :-) I think the coconut milk was a nice touch. Big up.
Can I throw this all together and put it in the crockpot low and slow?
Nice...exactly how I would do it. You got to add Pigeon Peas!! OxTail is a wonderful  meat but unfortunately the grocers know it!! It's affordable for two people after that just buy Ribeye steaks for your guests. One of my favorite winter time comfort food...Trini in northern PA..Thank God for Amazon!!
Making this right now 😊 Excited! W/ butter beans and collards and white rice
Old  middle class white boy introduced to Oxtails by me sweet wonderful black woman neighbor! Love her and her cooking!
HA HA HA  Great video and Marvelous recipe Thank you,...
Had me until the coconut milk. I think this one particular ingredient that will be a huge hit or miss with people. If you make this recipe, id recommend trying it with and without it
Oh my not the way Jamaicans do it.  Interesting Ketchup, coconut milk & burn sugar? 😁✌✌✌✌❤❤❤❤
Looks delicious chris! Im gonna give this a try tomorrow
In the next time please use the wooden spoon .. because the sound was annoying ... as well as to maintain the amount you use
"Scrape off any extra fat"?????
My south african wife just made this for the first time  Ok ok wooow amazing taste
What oxtails are season very well but when I add the browning sauce it has a bitter taste. I make it without the Browning Sauce but I would like to try it again
The best 10min 30sec spent!  Subscribed and will be making this!
Listen to this man guys... when handling raw pepper WEAR gloves.  My God I got pepper burn on my fingers and that lasted for about a WEEK.
This here. Oh my gawd!! This was my first time and it came out so delicious 😋. Very flavorful. I used all ingredients. Made my fresh green seasoning ( went online and got the recipe ) and I freezes the rest. I am so proud of myself for achieving this flavorful and tasty dish. Thank you!!
Oxtail needs to be dissected and not cut into pieces.   A butcher should know how to do it
I will post my pic after it is done cooking. I can't wait!!
Accent is fake
If want to use pressure cooker how long set it for?
Lord have mercy
Brother you are the best. These are delicious.
Great
This was by far the best oxtail recipe I have  ever made! Thank you!!!
So easy to follow and it comes out great every time ...thank you for this great recipe got so tired of spending $14 for 3 pieces at restaurants
Chris, I want to make ox tails and black beans in the crock pot, can you help me?
I tried this recipe and it was the best oxtaillll everrrrr... so yummy and full of A M A Z I N G flavours 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
man this recipe is too damned complicated
Omg! This looks amazing! I got to try this! 😋Tfs! 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
what type of pot is that? im looking for one!
Imma try this tonight.
Man, this looks amazing.
ox it up
Looks good although u not showing labels of some of spices u using.
Oh my goodness 😮🤤😫♥️
Look, fam, brother, this was amazing. At the end I stirred my pot and the meat fell off. There were bones I didn't even know had meat on them... you weren't lying about the smoke on the sugar needing a vent  either. but You could definitely taste the effect, so delicious. Thank you, definitely going to do again. This weekend was amazing.
Got me some this morning ( on sale at halal market), they're marinating..😋
Chris I send thanks and love from Upper Darby PA,
🇹🇹
Can this be done without oxtails?Can this be a meatfrre dish
Can you use a replacement for the scotch bonnet peppers?
Made it today and it came out so good!!  I cooked it in the pressure cooker for 30min and simmered it for another hour with the coconut milk.  Then add butter beans 15 min before serving... Definitely a keeper!!!
I don’t care of about the price, I just get mine OxTail from VYBES kitchen and grill on Gunhill Road and Burke Avenue in the Bronx 🤷🏻‍♂️ and call it a day. Loving that curry chicken chicken , jerk chicken, and oxtail #WINNING! 💪🏼😎 YES SIR...
So when will I add the butter bean??
I'm glad I chose this recipe to cook oxtail for the first time. It was so delicious!! I still hate the price of the oxtail tho 😩
I really really like that cocounut milk addition. Hmmmm
My favorite recipe on this channel and your website. It is truly perfection.   Oxtail are very expensive, they're a special occasion treat for me.  So, I use beef or pork neckbones instead. I've been wondering  what are popular ways Carribean folks prepare beef or pork neckbones?
Last time I used this recipe perfection was produced. But this time I used the whole ginger I hope I get the same results
The best! I was afraid of burning the sugar but I got it the first time. Severed it fufu perfect! Thank you
3 hrs???🤭🤭🤔
I been watching ox tail video's for two nights.  Your recipe and cooking process wins the prize.  This is the one I am going to make.
Definitely not the best I've come across but it can pass. lol
Jamaican are known as Benjamin in the Bible. Subscribe to iuic.
My daughter is allergic to dairy and coconut. What can i use in place of the coconut milk?
Caribbeanpot the best oxtail recipe, it was delicious....
AMAZING FOOD !!! AMAZING RECIPE!!!   AMAZING VOICE!!!.......   !(1.) What is the name of the pot and lid that he's using !(2.) How much does it cost please?
I'm going to make this for sure..yummy..
this looks delicious. Saved video, will make this one day! Thanks for sharing and love how to explain your food. Great video!
#CarribeanSunshine. That is all.
Chris, Chris, Chris, you can cook your ass off!!! I have been cooking ox tails for years. However, I never used these spices with them. Never would have added them until I saw your video.  I made this dish today and it absolutely rocked!!! I did not use the coconut milk so it was like the recipe on your website. DELICIOUS, DELIGHTFUL & SCRUMPTIOUS!!!!!  You have won a new fan!!!
Chris I love your recipes! You're going to turn me into a great future wife! Supporting from the UK🇬🇧
You said ginger but I do t see it in the recipe I'm glad I watched the video ur The best
Where can I buy Caribbean pot vol1 that ships to the uk?  🇬🇧 Thanks
Gees dude, it's called a pressure cooker. It's used for peas and meats( oxtail, goat etc). 20 mins in cooker and then finish up cooking in pot. Unless u r not an ardent cook and don't want to invest in a pressure cooker then 1 hr or more for cooking red peas and 2 to 3 hours cooking tough meats. Not really worth it when oxtail and goat meat r mucho expensive.
can u add some red wine to the pot or in the marinade process?
Pamela from detroit Michigan USA Again your food looks good
Your food looks so good
Very different from Jamaican oxtail but it looks good! Going to try it!
I love ur accent💗
I was able to get grass fed oxtail for 5.99/lb! Making this on Friday. Is it okay if they aren’t cut? I bought it frozen and it is still in whole medallions.
Mmmmm!  I love a man that loves to cook.
Followed this recipe today and the results were outstanding! Can't thank you enough
Jeez us that looks fantastic!
My god, that looks ridiculously good
My, my, my! I've got to try this gluten free. There's no way this won't turn out to be the bomb.
my husband grew up in the Bronx and his Jamaican neighbors fed him a lot..... When I found this and made it for him he said it tasted just like what he remembered. So thank you for sharing. I have been making this 2-3 times a month now.
We like washing our meat here in America too🤔
My Lord, you're a gift from God.
I have made them several times, but I just tried this I completely forgot to let the first liquid to boil out but still turned out very tasty my mouth was watering just when. I was seasoning I used beef soup bones because that is what I had so it didn't take as long to cook. Thanks yummy
Awesome
Looks amazing.
Sounds like a great recipe, really just different in terms of seasonings from how Ayisiens make it but with the same technique... one thing about the sugar, though melting it is important it doesn't have to  happen separate from the braise ...I usually add sugar to my marinated meat to allow the maillard reaction to happen at the meat surface while braising.   You end up with the same browning but it's stuck to the meat by default rather than picked up from the pot after melting the sugar over heat. That Maillard reaction is a major element to complex taste molecules that transform the taste of the final product to what we in the Caribbean just love. Great recipe thanks for the share!
Making this tomorrow
Were can I get a big dutch pot like that from? 😫
Just buy browning
Yes Chris loving this recipe. Send a big shot out for my Beautiful WIFE Margaret Hendrickson, She an amazing cook. On your next Video!
It’s look yummy . I’m Montagnards North Carolina.
That looks amazing! What are some good sides that go with that?
U did that Sir God bless u.
Awesome oxtail,I made this today after searching for a good recipe,flavours Delicious,love it 👍
Chicken and dumplings in Caribbean style. Please.
245 jamaican haters..lol keep going Chris! That gravy need to be more heavy though.i want it to sit on the rice not wet it up.
Looks good, Can I use beef stew instead? I had oxtail before don't like that after taste.
delicious yamy
I am not a red meat lover with Oxtail and boerewors being the exception. I tried this and it was banging even though the sugar crystallised once i put the marinated oxtail. Am sure with a few more attempts i should ace it. Thank you
Chris that vegetable paste come from us Haitians(epis) and Hispanics call it sofrito give us props man. Jamaicans don't normally do it.
i just can´t handle the accent
This is a great video I like the way you give clear detail instructions. I love oxtails😀. Great job!!
Thanks, Chris
Great job on the tails
Today is my third time cooking from this recipe. It gets better each time with practice. It’s summer so they’re on sale. Thanks so much!!!!!
I'm so glad you made a video for this, I have been making this for many years. I like the coconut milk idea, I will definitely try this next time!
Very nice
Love ya food mate 👌🏻
I always love a good coconut milk sub, but not for this recipe. I was a lil hurt that I did it. I spent $20 on my ox tail.
Thank you for sharing this recipe. I've made it with coco bread and it was beyond amazing. I didn't have the green seasoning so I put our own creation roasted garlic and pepper habanero spice and it killed it. I'm keeping this for next time. Keep it up!!
nice
Mayyyyy your accent 👌👌👌
I love that pot
Where can I get a large pot like that
Does the gravy actually taste like milk or coconut? I hate both but really wanna use the recipe
Thanks for sharing this recipe,adding the coconut milk  is a nice touch.

U sound Trini.  Thanks for sharing.
Good one mmmmm it look nice. mzansi for sure
Can u make veggie oxtails please
Love all your recipes Chris!!! Keep doing your thing so I can do mine 😁 Thank you for all the fabulous food!!! My oxtail came out Amazing,Thank You Bunches!!!
I tried this way and it works, I recommend this way too
Yummy
When did Oxtails get so expensive?
looks good.. i just don't like the accent.
My daughter is allergic to tomatoes... Will it be okay if I don't add any?
Used this recipe and just had a taste before I serve it tonight. OUTSTANDING. Thanks man.
Well done.....I could actually taste and smell it!
I see all this comments about oxtail being expensive. Guys where do u live?? In my country (Netherlands) and many more in Europe Oxtail is one of the least expensive cuts. Im curious
The longer and slower you cook oxtail the better....my family love it but it can be expensive at times....just find a good halah butcher....in uk about £15 for a whole tail...
I am from Jamaica and our oxtails looks nothing like that. The cut of the meat looks more like mutton than oxtails. Different look but i rather our Jamaican style
Looks good 💞❤️
Finally tried this recipe and my hubby loved it. It has an incredible taste.  Am from Ghanaian background and we love our peppers, so I added a little more of the pepper for spicy. Love your channel.
I just want to say I love your cooking!!!!❤️❤️❤️And I’m still making the fish balls there a hit with my family,,, And all the other stuff tooo Thanks yummmmm
I don't remember what ingredients my father used to make ox tail but it was good. I'm going to use your recipe. It looks so yummy ☺
I made it for Thanksgiving 2017 and it was absolutely amazing!  I had to add more seasoning toward the end in order to bring the flavor up, but it was absolutely amazing.   Thank you!
I am in Mexico and just bought some oxtail (cola de res or rabo de toro) and it was huge with a ton of meat.  Some of the disks were like 4 inches in diameter.  Cost me about 10 buck US and had to be at least 4 pounds.  It was frozen when he cut it.
Never made this ,  but now I am .  Sooooo hungry
Ummm... The real mf deal! This yankee knows. Thank You! ♡
I did not use all of the ingredients but it did come out perfectly. Thanks for the great recipe.
Im Italian. We do oxtails very differently  but I wanted to try Jamaican style. OMG. Such incredible flavors married together.
Your style of cooking is exceptional!!! Love it
thank u again I wish I could be a magician and reached inside that pot and eat all hat stew thank u again
this batty man need to stop thieving other people recipe..
As soon as i see a recipe that uses ketchup, i lose all interest!
Can I use a pressure cooker to cook oxtails?
something tells me that this man isn't from Jamaica. yah Mon...
Chris  where  did  u get Mr. Dutchie from ? (Pot) I bought  some for my daughter  but i don't think they are any good. Everything  sticks no matter the  temp.  And  after a year  of use they  don't  look nothing  like ur Dutch  Pot, LOL
This recipe was on fire! Saving it for later <3
Chris, I  haven't been able to find your cook book. Can I buy it on Amazon.com?  Also, I have been watching your videos for some time. You should offer a travel vacation combo. The first 2 days would consist of you taking people around a key location to nice restaurants. The last day would consist of you cooking a meal for those people. I would be the first to sign up:)Thank you for giving the gift of carib cook to Yankees like myself... Peace.
Love you recipes, do you have one for a slow cooker
He can lose that fake accent. However his recipes are bomb 👍
I'm Mexican, and my boyfriend is from Jamaica; and since we started dating about a year ago, he always said that he was going to cook oxtail for me. We live en Egypt so it was hard to gather all the ingredients, but I did. I'm a good cook, and since he works too much, I decided to cook it myself. I tried your recipe .....OH MY GOSH! it was so good that he invited his friends over ...they emptied the pot and said it was one of the best they've had. Thanks for the recipe, I loved it too. Actually tonight is the second time I'll make it :)
This is a oxtail I will have to make soon bought some Dominican style yesterday and was great too.
I love your recipes and videos Chris!! Keep up the great work!! I have my oxtail marinating now, going to let them marinate overnight and then make these bad boys for a nice Sunday meal with some rice and peas.
When I make this for my husband. He inhales me.
That brown sugar was what I've been missing..
Is green seasoning like sofrito??
Another good cheap cut of Beef is Shin of Beef and cook it in a very similar way in a slow cooker, Like most cheap cuts cook it low and long and it tastes great? Oxtail I remember as a boy after being to the abattoir with my parents (I am part of a big family) and buying a quarter of a Cow and we would pick up Oxtails (We know they were Beef not Ox) and we would all help butcher the meat, Meanwhile the Range would be on and the Oxtails cooking to make Oxtail Soup, That and a Door Step of Fresh Bread and your meal was made
I just searched for this video to hear him say Mr. Oxtail.
I like this recipe... still what exactly does the Coconut milk do for the taste of the meat??? if you don't mind me asking.  I love coconut milk an never used it with oxtails.
Battybwoi Chris
OMG you Jamaican people nobody i say it again nobody can make oxtail like you guy
The ginger is missing from the ingredients list.
Thanks for the recipe, I wish I could add a picture to show you the beautiful, deliciousness that I've create...  Thanks Again ☺
I use the pressure cooker,  it cuts down on time,  but not flavour!
Whats in the carribean green seasoning
You for Caribbean, Cooking with Carolyn for African American, All Nigerian Recipes for West African and Bryant Terry's Afro Vegan for the rest!  I'm all set!  Thanks!
100% would recommend this recipe, super tasty meal 👌
great cooking man
i love oxtail.
I just put them in my crockpot with onions and peppers, throw a little ginger and curry. Good to go.😍
Oxtail soup. The best.😍
8:06 i thot they tell you to toss the marinade liquid... that it is NOT to be used??
I'll be making this tasty dish this week!
that looks soooo good! damn!
Wow, Wow and Woweth. I definitely going to cook that for dinner tomorrow,  yes siree! Subscribed.
YouTube needs  LOVE IT! button.
Neeeegro! I just made this tonight and as of now I will not be visiting another Jamaican restaurant again. This was awesome. Only changes I did was I had some jamaican oxtails seasoning I brought a year ago which was added. Also I used 2 Tablespoons of Browning and last I cut one habanero into slices and floated 2 more. Did it with the coconut milk. Was scared about the milk but it was freaking awesome! Gr8 recipe!
Yeah rice. You are not eating oxtails if you don't have any rice lol. You can put it on a shelf.
it's good to make oxtails and let it sit overnight so you can scoop off the harden fat that forms on the top so that grease doesn't keep coming back up in your throat. That is if you have patience to wait. It also tastes better the next day just separate the vegetables so it doesn't get sour.
do you have any recipe for preserved mango plum etc?
Good food but too expensive😣
Oxtails doesn't cook with Ketchum or tomatoes never an the stupid idea some cooking it with carrots never no salt either
I make your recipes all the time and is currently making these oxtails. The smell in my kitchen is litttt! 💛👌
looks awesome ...can i have them with beans bro....
Please do some Bahamian food! Conch fritters, conch salad, crack conch and lobster, crab and rice, guava duff
thats different but doesn't top Jamaican style
Lost your recipe for your Tinned Mackerel Dish  Dutty gal  and cant find it in your Videos Any chance you can re post it please
oxtails are so expensive here in Idaho... I usually only make em in a soup between all my sister's pitching in lol. ...
Never tried coconut milk in my oxtail yet.  Have to try that
O my goodness that looks good.
Use neck of lamb as an alternative too.
I followed this video and OMG!!!!!!! AMAZING!!!
Eh Slim! What's the name of the chune in your outro? The tassa one... Dah chune deh maddddd!
Dis is not how Jamaican cook oxtail.We dnt put sugar in our food etc. We season it and let it cook by stewing it down.Then we add the tip of ketch and bean later.
If I were to make this recipe and I am! When I decide to reduce it can I half the water with more coconut milk. Like instead of 1 cup of water can I use a half cup of water and another half cup of coconut milk? And I keep hearing that oxtail is expensive I think here in NC I can find them either 4 to a pack or 8 for under $10. is that suppose to be on the high side?
Honestly man you know your stuff in the kitchen. That dish was amazing A++++
your accent is so 🐣CUTE! LOL
Thank you so much! I made this on Sunday and the coconut milk added the best flavour. You had my 6 year old picky eater asking for more gravy on her rice.
It ain't nothing like a man who knows how to cook keep it that looks good btw
Ok. I looked through all of the Caribbean pot videos and also the website and I can't find the receptor for the Caribbean green seasoning. Can someone give me this recipe?
How is he speaking so differently from his previous vids. I know he is trini but it sounds forced...compared to his past vids.
ate oxtail while watching this...I give you props for making your own browning. OG
I looked on your site under recipes for Caribbean Green spice and could not find it. Would you post the recipe here? Thank you.
Looks great! No scotch bonnet here :( Do you think I could replace it with some dried powdered chillis (I've got lots of these, ghost chilli etc) in the marinade, or should I just add the chilli after I start simmering?
Thanks for the video. I am making some good South African style oxtail tomorrow for Sunday lunch. I will be slow cooking mine throughout the night, I want them to fall off' the bone... Mmmmmm
"that Caribbean sunshine" love it!
Dangerously Delicious .......  Vibez it up Chris
You can used browning to get your colour
I am Jamaican and oxtail is my favourite
Oxtail is more delicious curried than stewed
Chris you are a beast....I bought your cookbook years ago.....it was in my escalade when it got stolen.....when they found the car....all my valuble steareo and a few credit cards were still in it.....the only thing stolen was your cookbook  lol.   One day i want you to design me a menu for a possible Caribbean lounge.
I never thought of adding coconut milk.
What's the name brand/size of your pot? I need to buy one of those!
You recipes give me life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful CLEAN cooking my friend...just how I like it👍💓👏💞. I will yam your food anytime...keep up the great work👍
This is my first time making Oxtail. I used all the same seasonings, except for the Caribbean green seasoning. The stew has nice color and the meat is falling off the bone however the taste of the stew isn't there and doesent taste like other oxtail I have tried. Is the green seasoning that important where it can have a huge effect on the final outcome?
OMG!!!! Subscribed 😍😍😍
looks good! mann
Yummy Chris!! I made this and it was beyond delicious:)
Looks great!
The green Caribbean spices you used looks like Jamaica Jerk Sauce.  Is it?
coconut milk can be omitted correct, loving your channel. i'm new
It is exspensive in Ca. Also
All I see is a pot of bones, where's the meat?
Hello! Your recipe is really good! I am going to do it again soon but I have one question: do you parboil your meat? My intent is to reduce the grease as I had to remove much of it when it was done--but I do not know if parboiling would defeat the marinade. Thanks! Happy cooking!
ok that looking great
forget to wash your hands after handling those peppers, then go to the restroom, you will never forget to wash your hands again
Thanks for your reply.
man. Had oxtail all my life but Tried your method and ingredients.  Awesome!!
Oh my! How do I get invited to your table!  Thanks to you, this U.S. girl can make a succulent pot of cow heel stew. Now this!! I'm told I make the best oxtail stew, but watching this, my recipe pales in comparison. Trying this recipe this week!
I made your oxtail recipe yesterday Chris an boy it tasted wicked! I let the meat marinate for 2 days.
Hell yeah! thats my shit! tastes so good make me bust a nut!
Chris can I use a crockpot?
can you use beef instead of oxtails
This looks delicious!
yum
who the hell put ginger in oxtail ? definitely not a real Jamaican!
its miss christine pig
Yummy 😋
Wow! Can't wait to make this. Looks so delicious! Yum, yum.
What herbs go into the green seasoning as you just have it down in the description as green paste.
Most delicious and tender cut of Beef you can get. Oxtail is stunning!!
Proper!
The cutting meat into 1 inch squares is a great tip.. I failed at a pork neck-bones one time but I will try again with smaller pieces... I will try both and let you know how they turn out..btw i like how you respect the spices without trying to over-power the meat. keep it up
it looks so yummy.....I want to try to make them for a holiday treat..........hope to see more recipes!
wow weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I need this in my belly right now.
Chris you always have my family eating goooood! Thank you
Nice one Chris
My first time making this dish. thanks for your knowledge!
Yum! Chris Thanks might make it for Thanksgiving
Chris you should mention that the water should be hot when adding to the pot when it's been cooking for a while.  If the water is cold then the meat will toughen up and take way longer to cook.  Just a trick my mama taught me (Lucian style)
I NEED this pot!!!
That moment you start cooking oxtail at 10 pm... Don't do it
I  have tried a few of your dishes already. So delish, going to do the oxtails as an added plate for Thanksgiving....
I just made this and the sugar burned like 2 times. in the end it turned out great.
3 whole hours?! Wow lol
I love this recipe. When I make it I also add butter beans and eat it with either some white rice or some rice and peas mmmmmm. Love watching you cook and making some of your food for my family

One of my favourite meats is Mr Oxtail. Living in Canada, one has to get to the "butchers" to get the best selection. Buying from the supermarkets just don't do it for me.
I am soooo upset i put the coconut milk in! Not tasty at all, $60 worth of oxtails in the trash
I'm cooking this now I can't stay out the pot that gravy  is everything thank you this will be the only way I make oxtail for  now on
jamaican-me fool with that ketchup 💩
Damn Damn Damn that look so good!!!  lol
What is his ethnicity?
Nice CLEAN food...mmmm..just how we black people always do it ;)
no sah but look good
HOW LONG COOK IN CROCK POT
we like washing are meat in America also
I like the recipe,  minus the Ketchup. I thought that was a Jamaican thing (due to British/European influence)  to stick ketchup on everything. Yuk!  It's the Americas, the motherland of tomatoes,  smash a regular tomato. We don't buy ketchup where I'm from. That's like buying hot sauce. People  visiting  LatAm/Caribbean  complain about not being able to find hot sauce brands in stores.  LOL!!!! You're in the motherland of hot peppers,  PICK some and make your own. We make it,  not buy it.   But elsewhere,  OK. You gotta buy it.  Good recipe!
I'm loving recipes thanks
😍 oh my! I'm so going to try this. tfs
New Subbie here!!!
ugghh that looks so good
How long and at what setting would you cook this recipe in a pressure cooker?
OMG delicious !
Man dat a well seasoned Dutchie Pot!
can I cook this in a crockpot?
Nice recipe. Oxtail too damn expensive here in New York. I only make it when I know I don't have company coming over. Want the whole pot all to myself lol
Today I am trying this recipe, marinade was very nice (I added little bit more onion, tomato and extra garlic because I am a bit greedy :) ) At the moment I added coconut milk and the rest of marinade. I tasted it and it was lovely :D Can wait the next 2-3 hours to pass ;)
What Is in the green mixture, is it sofrito or something else.
how about a video on curry boneless chicken breast? just a thought
it's a pleasure watching you.
Chris, your recipes are insane! love em. btw, you have the most beautiful and the whitest teeth I've ever seen a man... big up!
need to do a Grenadian oildown
Where is the video for the green seasoning
just add boc choy and peanut butter and you have kare kare.
make it short ,too much talk
why is this Trinidadian cooking jamaica food and they don't like us jamaican

Stew Oxtail
Chris, I always rave about you. Your recipes and videos are excellent and I love how you personalize it
Im excited about trying this! I think I would still go with the slow cooker on that last boil though.
agree with you 100% jopam3
Never tried it with coconut milk, but this sure looks inviting to the palate!!!
Another great recipe. Vibez it up Chris.
My goodness... i luvv me some oxtail. This looks so gooddd. Gonna make this recipe this week.
Using dis one for outreach project.  Yuh could really spread God's love wit dis one.
hey chris what about doing some tripe from cleaning to table
I can't wait to try this! Never thought to use coconut milk with oxtails so I'm excited :) Your original oxtail recipe is AMAZING... don't downplay it!!
All I have to say is wow looks amazing keep up the good work.
If I wanted to use my crockpot. at which point would I put it on the crockpot?
Lol warning uno-looks goood😍
i had oxtail today from faye king. ...so tasty. I am going to try and perfect it myself
Oh gorm this look so yummy good.
*drooling*
How do I make the "drooling" emoji?
WOW... never made oxtail before and followed the recipe and talk about just a dish fit for a fine dining restaurant.  After braising, I used my pressure cooker (cooked for 45-50min) and yea... meat was falling off the bone!  I couldn't ask for a better experience for my 1st GO at oxtails.  Next go, I'll add some butter beans and potato. Looking forward to the next recipe.
I've been meaning to make some Oxtail, I'll try this next weekend and let you know how it turned out
thx Chris for this recipe!!
With pidgeon peas and rice please. Can't wait to make this.
Omgosh yes! If I can't easily find ox tails here in Cali, I'll use stew beef.
ketchup I know you trini 😄
😳😳😳 ohhhh snapppp I'm about to learn how to cook oxtails!!!!!!
Beautiful
yuh dun know. i will try this one. Loving these videos! awesomeness. blessings from Greenz. Alana
u truly r a trini
soo good😍😍😍😍
Sooooo good over some nice rice and a slice of avocado on the side with some fried plantains and a cold lager. we in business Chris. Try oxtail with Okra some day if you haven't already, its delicious. Like in a Oxtail and Okra stew with some nice heat like this.
I really loved your other oxtail recipe Chris, it was so tasty.  I added butter beans along with the carrot and potato after a few tries.  This is obviously a different take which I will try also.  But wouldn't say your first effort poor.  I wouldn't put it down at all in any way. Please say your original recipe is also top quality my man.
Great cooking Chris really delicious looking   and inviting love it .
I've been watching you for years !!!! You have no clue how much you have been an added help to my kitchen ... I loooooovvvveeeeeee you !! Keep it up
chris question can i use my crock pot for this stewed ox tail.
That looks so good! tried one of your last ox tail recipe and that was delicious too!
We are making this TODAY. My husband has been jockin me for some stewed oxtail. Thanks
I've never tried stew Ox tail yet but will one day
Hello: Love your videos! Would like to know what type of pot you are using? Thanks from Los Angeles, CA.
I have to try this! Thanks for sharing the recipe :)
Chris my brother you killed it. yesssssss
I was indifferent about this recipe until you added the coconut milk. Now I HAVE to make this!
Lawd hammercy
Nice video my Brother. Way to mek ur own browning, learned something new. You did forget Garlic, no dish should go without garlic. Question: why regular salt over the many complete seasoning available?
Chris do you have recepies for the seasonings ?? this looks so bomb !! I wish I had you as a personal chef at home !!
Bones are flavor. Furthermore, why on earth would you add lime pre-cooking? I love your channel, and I have understood every recipe up until this, but you have lost your mind on this one Chris. Throwing away BONES! You have lost your mind.   No sane person throws away uncooked bones.  Children are starving in Syria Chris, and you go throwing bones away.
You bring so much soul to your kitchen, Chris.
that is burnt  sre you sure it didmt go in too lste
Delicious dish!
cut the man a check Heinz. good free advertising lol
Oh gosh coconut milk in stewed oxtail 😮😷
Homerun!!!
