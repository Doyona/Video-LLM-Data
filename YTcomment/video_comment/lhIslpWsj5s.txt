Honestly, the knife doesn't seem too sharp.
thats some crappy cutting skills. be honest
Zwilling "passion" cookware!  I'm very familiar with Zwilling products ;)
coool
Well done, that looks sweet
This is so cool! Luv your channel!!
O cara e loco
I don't know how it's called but it's when your legs tie whit thick rope and then you just fall down.
I just can't stop watching your videos, your ideas are just amazing and you are such a good chief! Keep on making great stuff dude! :)
I would love to try sushi but I don't eat any sort of sea animal
Using a wakizashi as a sushi knife? Nice :D
Assisting at the birth of my children.
So, are you not allowed to use artificial coloring in sushi rice? because that's what I assumed he used at first when he showed the pink rice, but then I was surprised when he said he used raspberries. (Please don't be harsh with me, I don't know anything about sushi)
Maybe its looking good but i couldnt serve it in my local. U should pay some more attention in cuting it right and maybe even use the bamboo mat because ur rolls aren't straight
Something I consider the most exciting thing was while I was rabbit hunting Northwest of the village where I live I was followed by a Kodiak brown bear. The full story is more interesting, but I think too long for a post here. Less you want.
I love sushi...
I have the best name for it, the alter ego roll
weet jij waar je goeie nori vellen in Nederland kan kopen?
I tried this at home but I did it differently, I had a thin bar of white, the a coloured bar (I didn't do two colours but you could if you split the bar vertically) which was twice the thickness,and I alternated and ended with a thin coloured bar, I made sure to know where the bars ended, I cut in the middle of the large bars and it turned out good (But way worse than yours because I'm new to this).
What happens if I use food colouring
I recently bought a large piece of sushi grade salmon.  It is too much for me to eat within just 24 hours so if I were to cut it before defrosting would the undefrosted part still stay fresh?
Could you not just make a Maki roll with salmon and then color one side with the raspberries or wasabi?
When I was a sophomore in high school, the marching band I was in played at Fiesta Bowl in front of thousands of people and was fifth in the nation.
The first time I went to a roller coaster park was very fun
wow...great looking sushi...can you post the link on different ways to roll your sushi ?? plz thank you
that knife is like sword
My most exciting story was jumping off a high dive! I was scared at first but then once I saw littler kids jumping off I thought (will...if they can do it then so can I !) I went up there and went to the edge of the Bord. Then my cousin said (don't look down!)And of cors I looked down! Then I heard my grandma say (come on Lorali!)And then it felt like someone pushed me off! Quickly I remembered that when I saw rand jump off he agent really stiff and and straight and did exactly what rand did then splash! I swam up and went to the leader. And that was it! Iv bean jumping off it ever since! Its really fun!
I could actually make them with Two-Face's colours and make comic book themed sushi! :D Maybe you could come up with some comic characters if you have time or feel like trying it out :)
I use to hate sushi but now I'm obsessed with it! This makes me want sushi! :) Your videos very good! Definitely subscribed!
What nori do you use? Please answer.
If I were a girl, I would marry you and eat all of your sushi. I guess I would be a slight gold digger.
You can actually get these on Amazon (I checked) and the one you like is $329.99 so whatever that is in Euros.
I'm sitting here eating a massive plate of sushi, and then realized you hadn't posted any sushi videos latly. Planning an early retirement from that poached egg video?!?! Do a seaweed salad video!
The most exciting time of my life was when I was a barrel racer for the Houston Rodeo in Texas. My horse was fast and sweet, his name was bullet. Although I didn't own this horse he and I instantly bonded and became friends. I trusted him and he trusted me. When we rode we were one. We won a few together. The biggest purse he and I won was 3,000. My heart pounding, his hooves bounding, the sound of the crowds cheering. My sponser may have owned him but, his heart belonged to me. I love your shows. Please don't stop. Hope you enjoyed my story.
1st is having  a baby sis in 2007
Thank you for all your great videos.  I've been watching for a while now and I made the teriyaki sushi roll, regular veggie rolls, battleships and the Full Moon roll this weekend.  Lets just say my wife and kids LOVED them!   I've only started to get out of my basic California roll phase (like 2 years now) and your videos gave me the courage to try new recipes.  I can't find all the ingredients locally (like grilled eel or sushi grade fish) so the adventures are a bit limited.    You inspire me to do more in the kitchen and, to be honest, I do this for my family, not just for me so the best reward I can get are complements and smiles.   I think the worst part of the sushi experience for me is the plating, I have absolutely no artistic sense, just good at execution.   Did you ever have that type of problem?  Great food, not so great presentation?  As for your question, the best experiences I had was being there when my girls were born.  :)
Am I the only one that was being driven crazy by the pink spot on the cutting board?
Today i ate bannana sushi *_*Awesome  Sry my english :D
Most exciting experience was going to Cuba my first vacation sadly the I got heatstroke on the day of swimming with dolphins and was sick the rest of the trip
Hey man I love your videos. You're very talented. I love sushi and now that I have stumbled upon your videos I think I will try and make some myself. Keep up the good work!
An extremely sharp knife that doesn't cut straight. Or maybe it was just you. 9:35 you can clearly see.  It's a cool innovation, but it just seems like a waste of food and time. Sorry. :/
Where do you get your nori and does it have to be sushi rice, or can it be just cooked rice
My most exciting experience would be playing on stage. The guitar was a big part of my life for a long time. I remember setting 2 goals: 1. I wanted to be in a band that played gigs & 2. When I played I wanted people to stop and listen to what I was doing. I was fortunate enough to have done both.
Your knives are just beautiful especially the one in the Cucumber wave garnish tutorial
I need these videos so i can mouthwater
why havent you posted a video in three weeks
your really cool even if you don't want to do it your still worth it your that awesome
100k congrats man
while the FDA has guidelines for the consumption of raw fish, it's stated nowhere that it is "sushi grade". "Sushi grade" is a marketing term and can be placed by anyone on anything. Don't sell the hype, but present the facts. Just because it says "sushi grade" doesn't make it safer, or less potentially harmful.
Davy Devaux , Really enjoy your videos. May be in Spain on visit...however, we are Jewish...so I can only use Kosher ingredients...do you have experience with Kosher? Thank you, Miriam
Make more videos. lol  I've seen them all 10 times.
I have watched most of your videos about making sushi, they're all Great! When I first saw the picture from this video, I was like "eh? it's normal sushi how come he made it today after all his amazing ones?" ( I only saw one side u know :P) But still I clicked to watch and wow, it's amazing sushi that I've ever seen! It was my silly at first, all ur sushi are extremly special <333 U're the best! (sorry if i made any mistakes coz my English isn't really good)
Do u make unagie sushie
I love your videos your a pro
Hey, wat als ik dit zou serveren voor gasten? Hoeveel stuks zou ik per persoon geven, in het algemeen voor sushi.. En is dit een hoofdgerecht of voorgerecht? Alvast bedankt ;)
I should have known you're Belgian!
Please make a video for ramen(which isn't the pork one) please
Thanks :)
are you going to start uploading more regularly? just curious because you kind of upload whenever
Thank you for all of these videos that you take the time to make. You have inspired me and my wife to try many of these techniques. All I can say is our dinner plates are much more attractive! Hahaha. Great job. Thanks again.
How creative! Looks good!
Hi. I dont actually prefer raw food in my sushi. Other than tempura prawn or crab stick. Do you have any other dish that i can use in mu sushi? Thank you. You make a really cool video. Keep it going.
My nutricionist told me to stop seeing ur videos...lol....
Excuse me, I love the knife in this video..... where I can buy it??? It's Miyabi..... but what's the name/series???? Thanks
When I was scuba diving in Maui this past December I was able to hear the Humpback Whales singing and that was incredible....a more intense and heart pounding experience was getting to ski first tracks with 80cm of untouched powder during a ski trip to Whistler!!!
i like to watch your videos because i can learn more about how to make, i am a sushi chef every day i try to improve my skills thanks for having this channel in youtube
Nice
very clever my most exciting experience was flying small plane solo for the first time.
My most exciting experience was probably when I went cliff diving in the Persian gulf. My uncle had his own beach side villa that he built there so we would go jumping everyday! Dangerous, but fun :)
You're channel is awesome!  Love it ♡♡♡ Keep up the great work!
First off thank you I really like you and your vids - I following after your videos and I really liked all of them. I'm making sushi and I'm taking your ideas and tips and it getting better. I wanna ask if you can upload more videos about new and special sushi.  and how can I improve my sushi rice cause I know that it's not the best.
looks awesome. but i think you should change the thumbnail. because i didnt really get how the sushi was special until i watched the video :)
1)The birth of my daughter 2) Graduating from paramedic school 3) The first time I had really great sushi. No really
Riding Bizarro (SFNE)
My first roller coaster ride. It was the Tennessee tornado at dolly wood. I went on with my dad and it felt like I was flying.
Your gonna hit 100,000 subs soon. I love your work.
your awesome
mine is going on diamond back at kings island nothing special
My most fun expriencing in my life is i got GTR Racing car
I want to ask: Why is the salmon that you cutted bigger than the holes but it still fits and the sushi sliced comes out nicely ?
I went to a festival called warped tour and moshed I'm never moshing again how ever I will be going back to warped next year
You were using a different knife this time. Why is that? The cuts in this video were a bit jagged.
After watching this video.I think spreading the different types of seasoned rice on the same piece of nori my have better formed rolls.I do think this is a very colorful and beautiful looking roll.I just never have that much time for one roll. For me its like 20 rolls 25 minutes thats including toppings, sauce, and design. Another great video with  beautiful sushi.Cheers
One of my most exciting experiences would be in Hatchet Bay, Eleuthera  Bahamas.While  spear fishing a Black tip reef shark came right up at me after I a missed shot at a Hog fish out towards the sand.As I was surfacing I noticed the shark cruising towards me and in a split second popped up and actually hit my mask with his nose.This caused me to have salt water rush in my face and thousands of air bubbles as I reached the surface.The shark since his nose hit the tempered glass just took off and left me with a small tooth mark scrap below my elbow. Happened on the Caribbean side of the island in about 20 feet from land in 20 feet water.I called it a day after that and we took the boat back to the Hatchet Bay.I spent the rest of the next couple days surfing Surfers Beach on the Atlantic Ocean side of the Island.Definitely in my top five most exciting. Cheers.
I hate to be picky but it drives me nuts every time you pronounce the 'L' in salmon D:
You should start a restourant i would go there everyday
intro framing needed a little more headroom like the ending. The rest is really very good. Comments on comments: thin ice at best, appreciate what you get and move on. IMHO.
i have a question chef devaux... is sushi supposed to taste really fishy?
first time i see a katana used for cooking XD and by the way AWESOME!
Do you work/own a restaurant? And where do you live?
I read somewhere that you can powder uncooked aubergine skins to create a nice purple-brownish color. Not sure it would add much flavor, though.
For me, it would have to be either when I climbed Pico Duarte (tallest mountain in the caribbean)
Wow. .. Maestro, you're a genius! Thank you for share your experience with us!  Gianni
Love your vids! Where are you from :)?
Really nice video and recipe. My most exciting experience has to be climbing an 80+ meter tall construction crane in the middle of the night and having to squeeze through a tiny gap above the drop to get past a locked trap door. And like your sky diving there are points where you fear for your life but then getting to the top and being able to see for miles the vibes become really mellow and you kind of circum to a unique meditative state. It was a really incredible experience.
Most exciting experience. For me was giving birth to my son all natural! It was a big deal for me because I'm such a chicken when it comes to pain! I was able to do it again! And will be going through the same excitement next February!
You can do this for a baby gender reveal!!!!!
For me the most amazing experience is sitting in a team car from a cycling team that rides 100km on a mountain. And the car in front of you isn't strong enough to drive further in the middle of the mountain and you realize there's a valley after you. but finally he goes further and you so happy that nothing happens with you or someone else. Sorry for my english i'm not  really good in it. But you are really cool and you make awesome things i learn a lot of you.
Try use different fish such as hamachi.  Plz
Une idée colorée ! :) A coloured idea ! :)
Amazing Recipe! Thx for your videos they are very helpfull
this was really cool . i am yr fan . the way u present yr stuff is really great . thx
is that a new knife? it looks like a mini katana :D
Is the salmon cooked?
How does he not have over 50k subbies
Which Miyabi series is your knife ?? It's pretty intresting. How would you compare it to 5000 MCD ?? Is it better steel wise or worse ??
My most exciting experience was scuba diving with my dad and just passing over nurse sharks and seeing all the different species and natural structures. Chef a question on your knives, in your older videos I saw you use a global yanagiba and what looked like a mercer blade. Unfortunately I am financially unable to purchase the miyabi blades. What is your personal opinion for the global and mercer as starting sashimi knives?
I saw a shark on a cruise that jumped out of the water!
My greatest experience was at a restaurant where I live, and the sushi chef let me make my own sushi. I love the four seasons roll you made a video on so I made that one. It tasted amazing, and I love the simplicity of the roll because it shows how something so simply can be so unique. I love sushi, I love your videos, and I also have two questions for you. 1. What happened to your right hand? 2. Is that a new knife you are using cause it looks really cool!(?) Loved the video, and I think skydiving would be fun, but I think I would hesitate at the plane door! Can't wait for the next sushi video!  -coolhandluke
Most exciting!, well can't say it coz it's too personal and want to keep it to myself. Cool sushi idea. You have serious sushi architect skills. But not for me to make it, don't like too much hassle preparing my food. But brilliant 👍
That looks so good! Awesome!
I want your kitchen
That is way too much work.
my most exciting experience was my first wrestling match after 6 months of hard training which was awesome as my grandfather was a wrestler. To carry on a family tradition.
knife skills need work most of those cuts were visually wonky and wouldn't it be simpler to just put the rice on one sheet in lines
Great job! You really have a lot of creativity and talent in your recipes, although I really reccomend you to do a jappanese plate with a beautifully cooked omelete inside. You are almost reaching 100,000 subscribers too so I really feel happy for you.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Unique and creative.
What is the green thing at 2:20?
Besides swimming with an alligator I did not know was right next to me, it would be snorkeling and finding a curious, but massive electric eel swimming beneath me! I looked down and saw him and my heart began to pound! I tried to remain calm so he wouldn't smell my fear and he went about his business and left me alone! I was so scared, but glad I was able to stay in control of my body so he would leave me alone. (They can smell fear and use it to detect prey)
I enjoy watching these before i go to sleep, not saying you're boring, i find it so calming and interesting... downside is i'm now hungry!
you should re-do some old video's :D if you want to offcourse :P
I see you are using different knives?
