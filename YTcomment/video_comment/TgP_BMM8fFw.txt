Save yourself some time and place tie dollar on the string first then tape the dollars ends.

Thank you for this video. Now I can make one for my niece's graduation :-)
Loved it
how much would someone charge for this
Thank you for this! I just made my first lei this past weekend and it came out great! For a first time though it took me 3 hours to get it perfect. Lol I hope to make more in the future.
Is there a way for me to get the written instructions?  I don't need it until next year.  Thanks.
i noticed you glued the colored paper, did you also glue the money ?
I want to do this for my daughter promotion.do you think I have to use less paper in money so it doesn't come out big?
Looks simple lots off folding
How many pink paper did you used?
Do You Have To Be Hawaiian To Give/Receive These
that's really cool i like it
it took me 6.5 hours from start to finish btw...but yeas after folding it did take about 1.5hours.
Soooooo cute!💗💕🎀
