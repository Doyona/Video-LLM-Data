2022
Tried this today, my second attempt. First time forgot to add vanilla. Thanks for saving my dessert! The first recipe I used had sour cream, and I'm out. This one did the truck! Thanks again!
Hi, I tried few times, still the cake when cut open, the upper part seemed fine, but the bottom part looked uncooked. I guess the problem is the egg/sugar/ butter did not mix well (separated in between)to have an overall good texture? As advised, I already when added in sugar and the egg to the butter, only little by little, then beat well with a hand held electric mixer (for how long this is need?). Where I went wrong? What is the required techniques? Please kindly advise. Appreciate your kind help. Thank you.
Great Teacher and Baker. Thank you for your delish recipes! 🥰💞

Hi mam...can I use all purpose flour instead of cake flour
I just want to know is it best to sift flour before making any cake even if it don't call for sifting thanks and would you sift then measure are sift after measuring thank
👌
I wish I cared about baking 15 years ago. There was this client of a place I worked at, an older church going lady, that would always make this delicious cake. I thought it was pound cake, but I cannot find a recipe that tastes like hers. I do not think she is alive now, but she would make it for everyone she knew and pass them out around the holidays. It was in a bunt pan (the plain, non ridged kind) and the outer layer was a hard crust, not like a pie crust, but not burned or just brown, seemed like it must of had a high sugar content for it to form that type of crust, and the inside was not a crumb...it was similar in texture to a Sarah Lee frozen pound cake...dense but not heavy. I could eat the whole thing. Any idea of what kind of cake this could have been? It really tasted like a Sarah Lee pound cake, but better because it was fresh and because the crust was hard ( it did NOT have the same crust as Sarah Lee). Also, my coworker makes these delicious Amish Potatoe Rolls, and I want to share them with you because of how much you have shared with everyone. I will list it below. They are to die for. One of those recipes that you never ever need to find another one to replace.
Hi, you said to cooked the recipe for about 55 to 65 minutes. Can you please tell me exactly for how long yours was cooked.
i tried it yesterday, it turned out so delicious but there was an issue, with that 55 min temp the top of cake got a bit burnt, that was too much temp for my cake
did u forget to tell the temperature of oven?
What is the brand of the stand mixer you are using?
Made it today and it was perfect, thank you so much 🤗
Great video!  Can i put cocoa powder in my batter
Beautiful lady , nice cake

Hi Stephanie I hope you keeping well, I bake this cake today it's amazing and taste so so good ,thankyou very much  and keep safe x
Dear madam, Hi am Dr. Pratap upadhya. I work and stay in pondicherry, India.  This mail is about how much me and my family love and appreciate your baking recipes. I only recently took up baking as a hobby and within few days I came across your channel in youtube. Many of the recipes given there came out really well especially muffins, cinnamoms and pound cakes. My family especially my daughter loves the taste and delicacy of the recipes given.  Thank you and keep posting more
Can i use evaporated milk or fresh milk instead of  whole milk?
Hmmm opening an oven to check a cake and the risk of the cake falling is eminent, right?
We juste made this recipe and it was great, soft, and delicious 👌
5 years later and this is still my go-to pound cake recipe. Thank you, Stephanie!
I call end piece😄
Made the recipe...flavor was great. However cake was dry. I did use all purpose flour instead of cake flour. I saw online if you subtract 2 tablespoons of flour and replace with cornstarch this is a substitute. Is this the cake was dry? Or is there something else I should do?
Can I use All-Purpose Flour?
hey.....the amount of sugar i added was too less and it turned out to be bitter too.....any ideas to fix it pleeaassee?!
Will all purpose flour come out the same ?
I have already made this loaf .it was a hit, I am going to double the ingredients and make a 2 layered vanilla cake. Believe me, its gonna be yummy
Baked the cake. Delicious 😋 Thank you
I baked it but with all purpose flour. Couldn’t get cake flour. The taste was great but I wasn’t too comfortable with the texture. It was a bit too thick for me. I think I will try it again. I  guess I didn’t beat my bater enough to incorporate air into it.
I have used this recipe 100s of times. It comes out perfect every single time. Thank you!!!
Hi Stephanie today I try to bake this cake for some reasons it rise in the oven then collapsed also was a bit wet in the bottom ,I’m not sure where I went wrong ,however it was beautiful in taste ,thank you very much for sharing your knowledge and keep well.

Ingredients please?
I baked this cake, it was so good. It was super thick and tasty
I baked your pound cake recipe three times.  The first two time didn't turned out well because I cut down on the sugar and butter.  The third time was better with more sugar and butter.  We cannot eat to much sugar and butter.  What can I use to substitute the sugar and butter so that the cake comes out like yours? I would like to use one third of sugar and butter if possible.
8 years ago 🙊🙆‍♀️😂😂😂😂😂
You are the best ❤️. I got confidence to bake first time in my life. Thanks a lot. God bless.
Hi,what was the weight of the baked cake approximately???

When you say butter do you really mean butter or you mean margarine? From the video it looks like you are using margarine not butter.
I some how made cookies instead
Tried this cake.  It was simply Superb 👌👌 Thanks so much Steffanie.  You're undoubtedly simply the Best.  God Bless you.
Tried the recipe yesterday, turned out to be amazing. It was my first try at baking a pound cake. It’s super yummm. Thanks for the recipe 🤗
I made this and it was so nice
Tried it and it turned out nicely.  Simple and quick fix for butter cake :)
You sound Canadian.
This is the first recipe I tried from your channel and it’s the best pound cake 🍰 recipe. Not too heavy. Just perfect!! Good job 👏 Thank you.
Made this recipe tonight! Approved by my husband and 4yo boy! This will definitely become a stable in my household! Thank you!!!!
I did this cake, followed to the T...it was so good.  Thank you!
What butter do you recommend?
Now I have a recipe to finally use my loaf pan :)
Hi Steffi.... Made the cake just now....ditto the way u showed... It rose git a crack down the centre but not as porous as urs ....wht could be the problem
Hello, I've been trying to bake a perfect pound cake for a long time. And i followed some recipes and none of them were perfect, either too fudgy, strong egg smell or too oily. I followed your recipe today and i got the perfect pound cake and I'm so happy. Thanks a lot, your recipes are great. 😊😁
Am trying the recipe out now. Only thing I had an issue with was incorporating the butter into the dry ingredients. I do not have a stand mixer so this was a bit of a pain. I think next time I will cream the sugar and butter then add that to the remaining dry ingredients. Another experiment will be using browned butter
"Classic Version"...proceeds to make a non-classic pound cake. Whatever....SMFH
I want to make this 🍰
Thanks
just out here looking for drake instrumental
I had to come and write this comment. I have been using this recipe for around 4 years now. Its absolutely delicious,  i adapt it for chocolate cake sometimes. I bake it for my children's birthday and I have used it for a few friends children's birthdays and people always love how great it tastes so I had to come back and give kudos to whom it is due. Thanks ma'am.  PS: I don't understand why there are so many dislikes 😳
Please write the ingredients.

Hello ms. Joy  I tried this recipe with coconut oil,  it was good. My son and I likes your recipe because you say everything with masure. Thank you
Honest and no beating about the bush.  Thank you.  The latest fad is to telecast programs but the recipes are bungled on purpose so in other words it is a waste of time.
Hello ms. Joy  I made this cake , it was perfect recipe thank you,  but I have a question,  it is possible to use coconut oil ? Thank you

My family loved the taste but said it was a little dry. Anyone know v why?  I used real butter, sifted all purpose flour twice and all other ingredients suggested. Baked 55 min in bread pan. It came out darker than Stephanies
We love it ❤️😋
Made the cake it was delicious, I'm  going to make it again !!
oven temp of 180 degrees C for approx 55 min - do you recomend conventional or fan forced?
I only have AP flour, which allows more gluten content. Anything I should do differently?

Love u so much & ur cooking style
Thank you Stephanie
I watch several baking channels.  Joy of Baking is my favorite because it is the most detailed.  In later videos, measurements of all ingredients are provided in grams (including eggs), which makes scaling easier.  As a baker, I really prefer percentages, as well, to improve scaling.
I love following your recipes but here lately whenever I make pound cake it comes out with the texture of corn bread and not dense and fluffy like yours.  Can you help
Can you use oil instead of butter?

I am dying for that mixer.
I like the look of it's texture and the comments are encouraging so I'm gonna try this tomorrow hopefully.
How many Celsius degrees please
Do we have to follow same steps to get that exact cake texture? Can we do the common butter sugar creaming then eggs then the dry ingredients?
Hi could you please type in the recipes for a quick look at it while following your recipe? Thanks
I like the way you give measurements in cups tbsp and metric it's really helpful thank you.

i tried this recipe today but it didnt turn out to be as good as expected. i followed the recipe as shown in the video. i think the measurements for flour are incorrect as 1 1/2 cups of flour should be 180gms as per the conversions guide on the website. also the cake remained little moist from inside despite of baking it for the time mentioned in the recipe. please guide if i have done anything wrong or not followed the recipe in the right way.

Hi. I have tried your recipe thrice now and my whole family like it. Thank you for sharing and teaching this recipe. I am looking forward to trying your other recipes. 😘 😘 😘
Hello, I have tried this but why at the bottom the cake looks like it's not cooked, but top is fine. What I did wrong? Is it overly mixed or less?
I love love this recipe. I used a bundt pan and it was done in 40 minutes. Thank you for this recipe
I just made this cake. It was a bit on the dry side. It was not as creamy and a bit on the sweet side however it was edible and had flavor. Thank you

Hi, I love love love your recipe, so yummy and moist and it comes out perfect every time I make it. I wanted to try making a coconut pound cake, how much coconut would you suggest I add and also do I have to substitute some of the flour?
i love your tutorials..you get straight to the point and you give exact measurements..thank you so much!
OMG ive done this like 5 times already and always comes out good . I made some today again and realized I used the wrong measuring cup for the 1 1/2 cups of flour . So I put less flour then it should have and now I cant do anything about it cuz it's in the oven 😭😭
I was very intrigued  with this cake method. I like the idea of less amount ingredients  than traditional  pound cake.  My cake is finally cool and is so delicious  remaind me my 89 years  old aunt pound cake. This recipe is a keeper  😃
Joy of Baking.. I have noticed that many questions about using all purpose flour instead of cake flour are being asked.  Could you please tell us if you can use the AP Flour instead?  For those of us who do not live on the mainland and find C Flour to be either not accessible or expensive.
Can I use this pound cake as a base to make a fondant cake? Thanks
I just made this delicious pound cake and it's off the hook!! I've tried many pound cake recipes on Youtube that turnout to be nothing more than a tasteless heavy paper weight.  What I love most about this pound cake recipe is that it's not heavy and dry Joyofbaking you are a winner in my book. Thanks you, Thank you Thank you!!
I've been looking for a much lighter version of the pound cake which as you stated is way too heavy for me. Thank you so much for taking the time to post and share.
Hi, I wish to seek your advice as to why my cake is not fluffy? Is it because I used Canola oil instead of butter? or is it because I used Air fryer instead of the oven?
I didnt have cake flour so I made it using normal all purpose flour and all other ingredients were the same.....it came out fantastic and delicious (i had used a handheld phillips blender).....got over the same day...thanks for providing a detailed and proper recipe with the correct measurements.
Can I add coco or chocolate to this recipe to make it as a marble pound cake? If yes, than now much of coco or chocolate measurement do I required..
Sugar??
Aisha Shoeb and Setha Lin's question, yes you can. Many a times recipes would ask for cake flour and I would use what I have, regular flour and my cakes come out just as good. Measure out the amount the recipe ask for, sift it twice, this makes it lighter. After sifting do not compact your flour into your measuring cup, just scoop or fill in desired amount, you may have flour left over from this :D
I had to watch your video 5 times before I baked mine, and it came out so nice and fluffy. Thanks for your thorough explanation. I don't need anyone to bake my son's b'day cake. I just need to double the measurements.
I'D LIKE SOME POUND CAKE!

Hello Stephanie! I have made this cake of yours atleast a couple of times and my dad absolutely loves this particular cake. But I don't think its working well as I find the cake extremely greasy at the end! Is the amount mentioned in the recipe a bit more? My cake is soo greasy that i can even make the mentioned butter quantity to half.. Can I do this? Don't want to ruin the cake and my efforts though. Please guide me. Thank you!
This video is very helpful thank you. :-)
What's the temperature?
Are you sure the cake gets a crack normally? Because usually people in other videos cut out the crack themselves.

Hello Stephanie. Thank you very much for the fantastic recipe and video. Mother's Day is just around the corner and so I thought I would bake my Mom a pound cake cause that's her favorite.  I followed your recipe and just finished baking an hour ago. The result was wonderful and yummy. Definitely a winner in my book. Cheers.
This was a really helpful video. I've decided to use this for my exam in cooking class!

HELP!  I've made this recipe a few times now but having a couple of problems.  It tastes good except: 1)  it doesn't rise much and turns out very small. 2)  it turns out very oily. I tried doubling the ingredients but the texture was tough. Thanks.
I love watching your videos, you make everything look so easy....Thanks Stephanie!
Hi ms stephanie! I have a question.. Can i use a regular flour instead of cake flour?

I'm loving this recipe. I bake some cup cakes and they were yum yum mmmmmmm delicious.
Yum
This recipe was easy to follow. I only had powered sugar used that and also added almond extract. It turned out great.  I wish there was a way to post picture here. Thank you. Your videos are the best!
Just thought I'd let you know I baked this last night but just tried it now and it is wonderful. I've made others but they were always too dense for me but this one is perfect for my tastes. I followed it exactly with exception to adding 1 tbs of fresh orange zest and 2 tbs of caraway since I eat this with black tea and it pairs better that way. Thanks chef!

Hi Stephanie,  Beautiful as always!  I have 3 questions. 1. Can I bake this in a normal 8x8 square cake pan, as I do not have a loaf pan at home? 2. Do you have any idea of how many cups of cake batter this recipe yields? 3. what difference does this method make compared to the creaming method  ( I.e to cream the butter and sugar first, then the eggs, then the flour) ?   Thanks and love all your recipes!
Is the paper necessary

hey, isnt everything supposed to be a POUND?
Your baking looks so good and delicious, can't wait to try your cakes
why do pound cakes have a crack through the top..you didnt explain why
It is in te oven right now!
You are doing a good job.  Instructions are easy to follow.
Hi Stephenie. I love all of your recipes. Yesterday I tried making your pound cake recipe. I did each step exactly as you did. I baked it in 45 mins. The temperature of the oven was 180C. But, unfortunately, I wasn't successful. My finished pound cake didn't have the same texture as your pound cake. Half of cake had moist crumb as your texture. But, the other half was  tough, and had light grey color. I don't know why. Can you help?
Hi Stephanie. I love watching your baking videos. full of tips and the recipe is good. I've tried some of your cookies and cupcakes recipes :) will try this one today :) Thanks for sharing! :) ﻿
I have found that using a nonstick spray with flour in it or buttering the pan and dusting it with flour makes the cake much easier to remove.  I have not had one to stick and don't have to risk messing up the sides trying to free it from the pan with a spatula. :)
It's an awesome recipe! I tried it this afternoon, all's well except that the part nearer to the base is not fully cooked. What can be the reason?
it looks delicious <3
hi stephanie, can you make a playlist of no electric mixer recipes? I would love to try them all..
does it taste yum
how can i make it more moist? its kind of hard to swallow. still tasty, though.
Thanks a million I love baking but I'm hoping you could throw some light on the range in regards to the temperature if it is a conventional oven or a gas oven.
Can I mix by hand because I don't have a mixer I tried to get one but times are rough and I sold mine months ago
Looks delicious! Could you please tell me how to incorporate strawberries or raspberries? Many thanks x

Hi Stephanie, I love ur recipes...u demonstrate them so well. I tried making pound cake. At around 40 min baking time, the toothpick came out completely clean..so I stopped baking it further.

what temperature should I set the oven for baking this??? (sorry... I am a novice :-) )
I have used Kenwood mixers my whole life with the exception of 6 months when I had a KitchenAid. I didn't like it so I went back to Kenwood. Now that may just be what I'm used to.
Can I ask your reasoning behind buying the Kenwood mixer vs KitchenAid? The Kenwood mixer you have seems good, but everyone raves on about the KitchenAid.
Love this!
Yes you can. Normally if you are using a hand mixer, as opposed to a stand mixer, you will have to﻿ beat it a little longer. I would beat it until it looks like what I showed in the video.
What if you don not have kitchen aid? hand mixer can do?
lol me and my mom tried making this and lets just say it didn't turn out so good :( the cake did not grow and it turned hard when it cooled.
bottom burning problem.... I bought the free standing oven thermometer to check the calibration, I used a baking sheet also. and the bottom burned anyway. =( at 40 min. I think its becouse my loaf is a silicone loaf. whats your theory???
Nice
how can know the butter is gud or bad quality? can u suggest a gud brand ?sometimes i have mistake abt it
Hi. Could I use some honey instead of vanilla flavor?
Hi. Where do you place the cake in the oven?(bottom, middle or top?)
Hi Stephanie, I love your videos. Have tried quite a few receipts too. They came very well. My husband loves the pound cake and my daughter brownies. Thank you. My question is I'm planning to bake a pound cake and want to decorate it with simple chocolate frosting. Please advise if I can go ahead.
It sounds like an oven problem if it's burning on the bottom. You could try buying a free standing oven thermometer to double check your oven's calibration. You could also try putting your cake pan on a baking sheet to insulate your pan.
Hi steph! I just made this, the flavor and texture were marvelous! although the bottom kind of burn (it did, it was black!) i cut that out. And ñami. I checked it and took it out at 50min :s
Just FYI - I doubled the recipe and got 7 cups of batter.
I'm sorry, but I really don't know.
I use a Kenwood Titanium Chef KM010.
Hi I am a huge fan of ur videos..n u as well.Which model of kenwood food mixer you use?i wanna buy one? Thnku.
Can you tell me how many cups of cake batter this recipe yields? I need 6 and 1/2 cups for the 3-D train pan I'm using.
I'd like some pound cake.
I use different brands. Normally I use Plugra, Kerrygold, and Land o Lakes.
Thank you for the great cake recipe. What is the name of the unsalted butter you are using?
Wow Ur a nice Teacher how to bake a cake
Did you ever have a kitchen aid . I have one and I love it and how would I measure the eggs to be a pund could I do 2 cups do eggs
id like some pound cake!
That would be my guess. I would probably buy a free standing oven thermometer to double check your oven's calibration. Or it could have something to do with the mixing of the batter.
Hi. I followed exactly according to your recipe and instruction. Nevertheless the inside of my cake turned out to be dense and moist. Could you tell me what are the possible reasons for this to happen. Did I over or under mixed or is my oven temperature too low?
Hi. I followed exactly according to your recipe and instruction.  Nevertheless the inside of my cake turned out to be dense and moist especially at the bottom. May I know what could e the possible reasons for that? Did I over or under mixed or the temperature of my oven is too low?
Hi
can i use self-raising flour?
Wow,just made it now. I love the way it melts in my mouth. Nice job stephanie
I thought the granulated sugar has to be grinded to a finest texture, but here the sugar is mixed with flour and blended for  a little time, won't it affect the texture of the cake. Thanks.
can i add fruits to this reciepe?
you can make you own cake flour at home by replacing 1/8 of your all purpose flour with corn starch and sift the mix three to four times
please tell me how to create a light glaze for the top!!
OMG I made this and it's amazing!
You could use an equal﻿ amount of all purpose flour. However,﻿ cake flour is a low gluten flour which gives the cake it's soft and tender crumb.
Normally about four to five day.
How long does it roughly keep for?
In the US cake flour is in the same area of a grocery store as the cake mixes. It's not with the flour.
Pls....where can I get cake flour?
If you used a different flour than cake flour yes 1 and 1/2 cups is not 150 grams. For example for all purpose flour 1 1/2 cups is 195 grams. Cake flour weighs less than all purpose or other types of flour for the same volume. If you weigh cake flour 1 1/2 cups should be close to 150 grams.
hi , thanqx for sharing the recipes,  I tried ur lots of recipes, really good  I have a question, when I measure sifted flour by 1 and 1/2 cups, but its not 150 g I mean 1 and 1/2 cup is not equal to 150g canu tell why?
I'm so sorry, but your putting me to sleep....
You could use an equal amount of all purpose flour. However,﻿ cake flour is a low gluten flour which gives the cake it's soft and tender crumb.
can i just use plain flour stephanie?
The crust can be a little crispy the first day but normally softens when stored a day. If the cake was hard inside then it may be over baked, over mixed, or too much flour.
Hi joy.. i tried it twice  but my cake was hard :( do you suggest me to use yeast?
No that wouldn't work.
Hello,What kind of tins you use? look like aluminum?
I tested it 15 mins before doneness then added the foil tent..baked for a total of 49 mins turned out fabulous , I can tell with vanilla ice cream with my family it is already gone..and that is what it all about ...Love from the kitchen , thanks again.
Thanks , I made this today , my fam loved it!!!! followed directions to the tee!!!
You could use an equal amount of all purpose flour. However, cake flour is a low gluten flour which gives the cake it's soft and tender crumb.
Does it have to be cake flour? Because I don't have cake flour all I have is bread flour and all purpose flour what do I do?
I used this butter to make cupcakes and the came out fantastic!(it makes about 15 cupcakes), I love their buttery flavor!!
The measurements are 150 grams flour, 150 grams sugar, 185 grams butter.
Hii mom joy, u means 150 gr cake flour, 150 sugar n 300 gr butter.
It sounds like it may have been over baked. Next time I would test for doneness about five minutes before the stated baking time.
Thank you for sharing! I tried this at home with my kids today. We used a hand mixer and we had to use the step of the foil with butter. Though my kids liked it, the final product was not moist at all...actually, it was rather dry. Any thoughts as to how to improve this? Thanks a million in advance.
Pound cakes do tend to have a crack down the center of the cake.
I'd like some pound cake!
It turned out really good!!!!! thanks!
hello I am making this cake  but I only have one cup all purpose flour and its not available in the mart now can I use 1 cup cake flour instead please reply ASAP! thanks
You should've said "The better the butter, the better the batter!" at 3:49 lol
Yes, you could use this recipe to make cupcakes.
Just finished making this cake. It's in the oven at the moment! Batter was very thick and stuck to the top of my hand mixer, I suggest to add the whole egg batter as it will be too thick to mix. Worked better and I just mixed it longer til it became like Stephanie's texture! Hope it tastes as good as it smells.
The brands I normally use are Plugra, Kerrygold, and Land o Lakes.
The cake came out good, nice and easy. This was my first pound cake and everyone loved it. What brand of butter did you use?
hi ! sorry to say that but i followed all instructions and the pound cake didn't look beautiful like yours ! but i love all ur videos thanks for making them.
Would anybody like some A POUND CAKE?!?!
just leave it out, does not affect the cake
Looks delicious!
Hi I love your videos. I have a problem, I cant find where the vanilla extract nowhere. What csn I use as a placement?  Please reply as quick as possible. Thankyou.
recipe
Ihave make this respy it was delisues .do it with out thinking. thnks for you for this resepy
The color comes from the ingredients (mainly the color of the butter). If your finished cake is raw inside it needs to be baked a little longer. I find it best to use the toothpick test (insert it into the center of the cake and it should come out clean).
hi love the video.. how its gets beautiful yellow color from inside? and how it will be moist? because every time I make it its white and more of a bread kind or some time stays raw from inside
Yes, you could use an equal amount of all purpose flour.
I'm sorry, but I've never baked in a microwave oven, so I really don't know what the problem may be.
is it okay  to use all purpose flour ?
Hi there,i loved this video, i'm a beginner in baking,i wanted to try something simple and thought would use this recipe, i do not have the conventional oven but have a microwave convection oven, i baked this cake on convection mode for 65mins on 180 degree, but it was a disaster , though i got a brown exterior the interior was uncooked and gooey, this happened previously when i baked an range shiffon cake can you plz help me and let me know the ideal temp to use on convection mode?
Very nice indeed. If I decide to make a real Pound cake ,only the flour,eggs, butter,and sugar should be 453grams please.?  J Mercieca Malta
OMG that cake looks so delicious!  Thank you for the very easy to understand instructions.
Miss can I ask is delicatessen paper and wax paper the same?Please reply.Thanks.
Looks delicious! Can't wait to try with fresh berries!
i made this cake today ,,,,it was awesome,,,,very soft,,,,i used salted butter and added no salt,,obviously,,,,thnx dear for the recepie
Cake Boss makes his pound cake in a flat pan. Can I do that? PLEASE REPLY!!!!
hi, Can you explain to me why does the process of beating last so long? because I think if the flour mixture contained baking powder, the beating would not take that long
Thank you for the video. Now I don't have to spend so much on Sarah Lee pound cake.
Exactly! Irrelevant and cutesy to the point of being offensive and then I start thinking, what's WITH these guys, they seem to be far too excited and out of control. But then again, thankfully, we have so many others who are not only marvelous chefs, but very professional as well like Stephanie, and many of them with a relaxed and genuine sense of humour as opposed to something that is totally  exhibitionist..
can u replace the buter with shortening or oil ?
@JoyofBaking1 I made the pound cake using your advice again, because the first time it came out salty, and it turned out delicious! Thank you!
I use a Kenwood Titanium Chef KM010.
Yes, I would also call it a butter cake.
Is this actually a butter cake? as i seen the ingredients are just same as butter cake. Thanks in advance for your reply.
pounding cake :D
If you use self rising flour, I would leave out the baking powder and salt.
For vegitarian option can we skip eggs? or what we can use instand of eggs?
Yes, you could use an equal amount of all purpose flour.
Can I use all purpose flour instead of cake flour?
Won't mixing the batter for that long create bread-like structure due to the gluten?
If I don't have cake flour could I use unbleached all purpose flour? Or could I use a combination of all purpose flour and corn starch?
I use a Kenwood Titanium Chef KM010. Not sure exactly how much it costs now as I bought mine on ebay quite a few years ago.
I am an aspiring baker and want to invest in a nice mixer like yours. How much did your mixer cost?
Normally if you are using a hand mixer, as opposed to a stand mixer, you will have to beat it a little longer. I would beat it until it looks like what I showed in the video.
I have an electric hand mixer, I beat the batter for about 2 mins, it seems pretty wet than your video.  After its baked, the cake didn't rise...was it because I under beaten the batter?  Should I continue to beat it until like the form in your video? Thank you!
thanks very much for all your recepies and your explanations you give !!!!Iam from Greece and i love your videos!!!
Can I replace wheat flour with almond flour?
came from ijustine thumbs up
It is a lower gluten flour that gives cakes a soft and tender crumb.
Whats the difference between cake flour and all purpose flour? I saw the ingredients in cake flour which has wheat flour like all purpose.
Yes.
can you make cake pops with the pound cake??plese answer*
i love you!!!!!!! u r the best <3 God bless you!
Your very welcome. Wonderful to hear it turned out so well. Congratulations.
The mixer is a Kenwood Titanium Chef KM010. The one we have in the video is a Delonghi that was rebranded, but they no longer sell it that way. In the US and Canada they are available on Amazon. You can check Kenwood's website for the rest of the world.
@JoyofBaking1
Ok thank you
Yes that will be fine. If you check out our substitutions page there are proportions listed for the substitution if you don't already know them.
I don't have cake flour but can i make my own cake flour With all purpose flour and corn starch
I notice you do not use non stick bake ware. Is there a reason for this?
For that many people you would need more than one, I would think.
yes
The Kenwood Titanium Chef was sold for awhile in North America with a Delonghi name plate, but it really is a Kenwood and that is the only way to get it today. If you google Kenwood Titanium Chef you will see it is exactly the same as the one we use. Our food processor is a Cuisinart.
It's a DELONGHI !!!.. I'm still tryna figure out what kind of Food Processor.
Maybe the batter wasn't mixed enough or the oven temperature was too low. You could buy a free standing oven thermometer to double check your oven's calibration.
The inside seems to be kinda wet on the bottom but I only put 3 tablespoons of milk in it. What did I did wrong?
I made this cake the other day. It was easy to make, came out perfectly and tasted Amazing! Everyone loved it :) Thanks so much. Can't wait to try another one of your recipes
Thanks a lot!
They are probably burning because of the setting of the oven has the top heating element on. Only the bottom can be on or the cake will burn. Changing temperature or time won't help. You MUST bake with only the bottom on regardless of what the setting on your oven says. All times and temperatures are what is stated in the recipe.
i also make so delicious cake
It would say cake flour. In the US cake flour is typically in the same section as cake mixes, not flour. It is in a box that looks like a cake mix.
Oh ok ty so if I was to look for it in the store would it say cake four or wheat flour? I don't remember ever seeing cake flour, but I have seen wheat flour.
Although you can use an equal amount of plain flour for cake flour, they are not the same. Cake flour is a soft wheat flour with a lower gluten content. It makes baked goods have a soft and tender crumb.
Is cake flour the same as regular flour? All I have is all purpose flour is that ok to use for this recipe?
It sounds like something with your oven. I would talk to the manufacturer of your oven. This is not something we could help you with.
waoww it was  nice cake i wanted to try this cake but i have got a problem i don,t know what is the problem with my oven it burns the bottom and does get brown from the top can u help me out with this huge problem :(
Yes, I would think it wasn't mixed enough so there wasn't enough structure.
POUNDCAKE SOME LIKE I'D!

I used the substitution for cake flour tath u hav mentioned on ur site... it turned out to b really light and soft...! :) every1 loved it...! :) but by the tym it cooled to room temp. it had shrunk to half the size it had risen to... what wud you say the reason for tath cud b...? perhaps not mixing the batter long enough...?

i love your recipe thanks
Gracias i love your recipe thanks
You may want to buy an oven thermometer to measure the actual temperature and compensate for that. Many ovens are off a lot from the setting and yours may be running too hot.
Stephanie: thanks for your work. I have made several, and they are always great! :)
Mine came up perfect. Great recipe. A+++
Ok..Thanks for the reply:)
I've only ever baked this cake in a loaf pan. You could use a round cake pan and bake it at the same temperature. As I've never baked it this way, I can't give a baking time.
If we don't have a loaf pan then can we use a normal cake pan.. If yes,which size?
Omg, thank you so much...that's why my time is always a little longer than the recipe. mystery solved. :)
Looks tender in the photo:) I like to try recipes if the detail of the photo shows the crumb of the cake. This looks like a sure bet, so I  will definitely try this one! I want the pig the is on the counter:)
Like Miss Paula Deen, I love the fearless use of butter, so my only quibble is the meager amount used in this recipe! She barely used a stick and a half, whereas to get one loaf I've been known to use two and a half or even three on occasion in order to achieve that sublime buttery flavor. Still her cake looks AMAZE-KINS!!! Thanks for the wonderful video and please keep them coming.
Darn straight, in fact it's a bare minimum amount. Anything less would just taste blah. The original pound cake recipe calls for an actual pound of each ingredient (hence the name) so technically she needs to double the butter she has,increase the eggs to 9 and lose the baking powder. Yup. It will rise without the baking powder and get a heavenly texture. I like old school cooking but I just eat less of something I've loaded up with butter. Call it balance :-) (I'm 5'8" and 140 lbs btw)
Love,love,love your videos. All the recipes I've tried come out perfectly delicious. Your amazing! Thanks again:-)
Happy New Year!! Thank you for this recipe, it was easy to make and really light and moist!  I make a pound cake using another recipe for Christmas dinner, although it had great flavor, it was very dense and dry.  This is my new go to recipe!  Thanks again!
Thanks so much. I've been looking for a good pound cake recipe. All of your videos are great. Everything is so detailed and it all looks so delicious!
I just tried this recipe, it turned out great! a bit crunchy on the outside but moist inside, I think it's perfect, thank you! =)
WOULD ANYBODY LIKE SOME POUNDCAKE!!?
I just found your videos and I love them! Subscribed!
You could use the same weight amount of all purpose flour.
sucesso
IDE LIKE SOME POOON'D CAKE.
see dropped the paper on the floor ....lol
Yes, pound cakes are quite thick in texture.
Great idea. That is what I did with the Lemon Poppy Seed Bread and it's delicious.
Could I make a lemon glaze with lemon juice and sugar and pour it over the top and let it sink in, or will the cake get too moist from that?
I love the fact that you don't only type the history of what you're doing and you also give a brief history on your videos! thank you so much.
A glass pan conducts heat a little differently, so the baking time might be a little longer.

Youtube is for everyone. Learn Spanish if you're going to try to read it.
Actually, English as a second language is supposed to be one of the most difficult languages to learn. Too many grammatical exceptions and incidentals and what not.
Learn english, it is easy!
