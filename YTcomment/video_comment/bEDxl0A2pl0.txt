"Thank You" Sir.for a great example.
(8:40) I think he's enjoying that a little too much 😆
Great instructional video! I had a chance to go ahead and replace the cartridge but I'm still having issues with dripping. What can it possibly be? Did I insert the cartridge incorrectly? Hot is Hot cold is cold... everything looks correct the pressure is good and I'm able to turn it on and off, but it's still drips!
Nice clear pictures and narration.  I had to refer back a few times in the process of replacing a 40 year old Moen 1225.  Did not need the special puller tool, just the provided white plastic fitting which enabled to twist the cartridge free, then pulled out with vice grips.  The first time I installed the Moen 1225 cartridge, I did added silicone plumber putty to the rubber seals;   the housing looked pretty clean.   However, water leaked through to the tub spout pretty badly.  Removed the new cartridge, cleaned out the housing with vinegar soaked rag (then rinse with water, then swab out with dry rag).  More importantly I used copious amount of silicone plumbers grease on all the plastic bits, including on the little O ring at the end of the inside shaft.
How do you know which model number cartridge you need? My faucets are from 2003
An awesome video!!! You get to see how is done.
Thank you for this video! It helped me replace the cartridge myself
Thank you very much 😊
14 years later this is still a fantastic video! Thank you.
Thanks for the video. 2025
I used the Danco puller (about 20 bucks) . Same design but a little less robust; however, it did the job exactly as he shows. Yes , you do need to put the provided grease on the two rubber parts and the Oring. ONA makes more heavy duty puller, different design ( some Chinese knock offs- given the comments on those, I would get a stronger screw at a hardware store. And a company called Lakeview makes a super-mega puller but it is $175. No Chinese knock offs for that yet. If you have hard water and the cartridge has been in there “forever”, having the heavier duty pullers would be advisable.
If you would’ve opened up the faucet in the sink, no water would’ve come out of that He’s having too much fun with that hole. 😂😂
Great !
I appreciate this video. As a woman knowing both of plumbing, this helped me fix a leak. Thank you!
Loved the video!  Made the job much easier!
Man, that was a great video Sir!  Tackling this issue later today and your information has been invaluable!  Thank you for posting!
without replacement part number the video is pointless........
Thank you for your professionalism and extra tips.
Thanks for help lots !👍👍👍
Never trust a plumber with a white shirt on..they will for sure make simple work seem very complicated.. I guess they need to feel important. Here is a hug dude, we will take it from here. Here is the remote, watch Dr. Phil is coming on TV.
Thank you very much its help me a lots !!!🥰😍🤩❤❤❤
Could there be a chance that water can get in around the collar and go behind the wall?
Vccg
Great video.  I had a hard time putting the pin back in, couldn't get it lined up with the slots on the bottom.  What finally worked was to push the pin legs in towards the wall with a small flat-head screwdriver, one at a time, while pushing down from the top.  Also had trouble getting the cartridge inserted all the way.  What worked for that was to position a cartridge puller as if to extract the new cartridge (without attaching it to the cartridge with the bolt that comes with it and without attaching its handle) and then whacking on it with a rubber mallet as gently as possible while still applying sufficient force.  The cartridge puller I used was a cheap "Everbilt Cartridge Puller for Moen 1200, 1222 and 1225 Series Tub/Shower Cartridges" from Home Depot.  It's a bit flimsy, so not sure how well it  work if it was needed for an actual extraction.  But worked fine for my purposes.
I doubt anyone will see this before I need the info in the morning but I'll give it the old college try. My Moen started leaking so I need to replace the cartridge. I am going to buy the puller and, of course, the cartridge but . . . .how do I know which cartridge I need? I figure I have to buy the puller first, pull the cartridge, then go buy the proper cartridge. Well, life is never simple. My roommate who does these repairs had eye surgery today AND I live in the sticks AND I have to do the repair AND I am female. If the way to do it is drive to town buy the puller come back out to the sticks and pull the cartridge and drive back to town to get the right one I will (the drive is just under an hour one way) but if I don't have to that would be helpful. I guess I am hoping there is a magical way to tell which cartridge I am going to need. The house isn't new and I am going to guess the set up is at least 15 years old. I purchased the house 9 years ago. Thanking anyone who has info in advance. Also there is no way to turn just the water to the shower off and the water leaking is warm (pretty good sized leak too not a slow drip) so I am heating water to run down the drain and my propane is burning away. It's never simple. 🙄
I was able to fix mine with the guidance of this video. Thank you!
Recently replaced a 1225 moen shower cartridge. And to my surprise it didn't work to mix the water properly. The water was hit or very hot! Removed the cartridge and shower head. Then flushed those openings, they cleared out some build up of gunk. The gunk clogged up the cold side and caused the problem. Flush before you install the new cartridge.
Followed the instructions and I was able to installed the cartridge. Shower works very well now and no water leaks.

I absolutely appreciate the web link you provided with tips, diy, info & book. It's a very resourceful guide & nkw bookmarked in my favorites home DIY tab. Thanks a million.
always a good idea to cover the shower drain so as to not lose the allen screw or the metal clip in the drain.
I have the same exact one, but the handle fell off due to metal fatigue and the stem broke off..   I can't get that plastic cartridge out because there is nothing to really grab.  I tried pliers but it's stuck in there really good.  any ideas.. Should i drill holes or something through it and use screws?
Man, the sexual jokes you could make from this video 😅
Those cartridge Pullers are 12 dollars, I purchased mine at a specialty plumbing shop
Well done job 👏
I can't get the 2 long screws to go in the cover plate
How do you change a double
Always a good idea to cover the drain hole in case you drop the Allen screw...
Excellent video Thank you!
What do you do when just the core comes out?
Y did that in my shower and know it whork good thank you for the help andim not  a plumber
That is good advice because some of them they going to charge you plenty of money not only because they are educated is all about money thank you for the video
How do I adjust hot and cold ? If my water is too hot how do I adjust it ?
I'm puzzled by why these handles stick out so much from the wall plate.   Or how to make it not look like that.   Is it the length of the metal sleeve causing it?
Wd 40 and needle nose vise grips your best friend.Some kits will give you a tool, doesn't always work if stuck in.Spray with wd40 ,Line up vide grips with plastic tabs on cartridge, twist to break seal and pull out.
Great video ,just what I needed. Saved me a bunch of money doing it myself.
Thank you! This was very helpful ❤
I'm having to replace this valve every 6-8 months.  Any ideas on what could be causing this?  Both replacements & the new one came with clear grease.  Could this be a problem?
Nice video!
huge help thanks so much
Great detailed repair work, thanks for sharing.👍
Very informative.  Wish me luck
Video but do you have to turn the water off somewhere in the house? I tried to pull mine out and water started to gush pretty heavily unlike when you pulled yours out I don’t see any valves or anything at the tub to turn the water off.
thank you.
I know this is many years ago but I have an other than Moen  Home Depot shower handle that broke and it's been difficult to repair.
Used this video to replace the cartridge but now the water pressure from the shower sucks. The shower in my guest bathroom is fine so I’m not sure what I did wrong. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
Just wanted to replace the plate cover of the handle, and the handle, and then when the opening water flow- leak thru the handle... So, will have to change the cartridge now I guess lol
Thank you much for your video, very very helpful
Yes I will try again because I failed once and I ordered another one. Yes I can do it
Very helpful and clear, thank you! My bonnet collar was stuck and I didn't want to pry too hard and couldn't find one in polished brass to replace it if I had to cut it to get it off.  I put aluminum foil in the hole under the valve and had it drape over the tile so liquid would not go behind the tile. I alternated liberally applying CLR and WD40 for about 4 hours... the bonnet collar finally broke free. I know plumbers can't wait that long, but DIYers may want to give that a try.
I'm stick it Delta, never go with this one it seen like they designed for home owners nightmare 😢
I had the problem at the end and I turned it 180 but that didn't work. If I put the handle on upside down then it works.
Wow! The shower tub valves seem way less "scary" to address now. We(my spouse and I) have a home with plumbing components that are now between 22 and 27 years old... each of the faucets have begun to leak (drip) through the 4 years we've been here. Addressing the sinks had felt very straightforward (easy).  Thank you for making and sharing this video!
The brass rod on our tub valve snapped in the full on position. This video helped me identify the problem and replace it in about an hour. Thank you!
Great video, ordered my parts after watching and will be taking care of this most annoying issue later this week.  Thanks for the great video.
This video just saved me $400 in plumber's fees. Protect this man at all costs.
Great DIY video! Total cost for moen cartridge, extra moen pin, plumber's grease and a knock off puller at Home Depot $66.45! The guy at Home Depot looked at me like I was crazy when he realized that I was fixing it myself. (Yes, I know I'm a women and I am going to fix it, lol) End result, It works great, I saved a lot of money and all due to your terrific DIY video! Thank you!
Good video. Good explanations.   Speaks to my project totally
This is crap. Title should read, “How to swap a Moen insert”. He said how repair the valve. That’s what I’m looking for. I have one that hasn’t been used a dozen times but started to leak. I installed a new one but it was $60 and the old one still LOOKS brand new, but it’d be nice if someone showed how to fix the valve not just replace it.
13 years later after posting and I still found this to be the best video on replacing a Moen 1222 cartridge. Very informative with step by step instructions. I did have to remove the escutcheon to access the cartridge pin, but other than that, your video gave me the confidence to tackle the replacement without hiring a plumber. Well done. BTW, call Moen to get a replacement cartridge at no charge (providing you can wait for shipping). No proof of purchase required.
definitely helpful.  Also on install go straight in as he says--but let me emphasize--do not shimmy or twist even a millimeter--I shredded a cartridge that way.
Took me a lil under an hour, I had the puller, and took a guess on what cartridge to buy, I forgot to pull out the clip at first and crunched the cartridge trying to pull it out, but after that no more drips....Thanks.
Thanks so much!
My setup is different I don’t have that long metal pice. What do I do now?
Ok question, I installed a brand new  Moen valve on my shed, but I ran only cold water to the left side and disabled the other side, No water is coming out from the top, what happened??
Thank you for that puller tip!
Just call a major plumbing company for the cost of insert replacement.
A moen valve housing is grounds for removal
I just went through Moen hell to change their valve from hell, you don't want to go there. Just look at the you tube videos.
Thank you
Mine is really stuck ! I replaced the other one in the other bathroom and heating it with a hair dryer first helped loosen it up. Not sure what to do with this 2nd Valve. Suggestions?
Thank you for your tutorial.
This video saved me! Even with puller tool the valve just fought me. It literally came out in pieces. your instruction gave me the confidence to keep going. The number on the existing valve has been replaced with another number but a quick search of the internet confirmed the replacement number. Thanks for taking the time to do this. There is one question ...there was a cheaper Danco replacement for the Moen valve at Lowes but I just bought the Moen one in the hope it will last longer. do you know if there is a difference in quality between the two? Thanks in advance.
Thank you, thank you, this video saved us a plumber and a lot of unnecessary $$ spent….YEAAAA
hope you bought the pipe dinner.
What size Allen Wrench do I buy?
These plastic moen shower cartridge and valves are a conspiracy of over complicated designed obsolescence nightmare to keep plumers pockets fat.
Thank you sir.  I was able to complete the job with your video.
It’s 2024 and this video is still relevant! You saved me from calling the plumber. Thank you!!!!
Yup.  $15 tool and $50 cartridge.  The instruction was perfect,  thanks!
Greetings, excellent, repairs the shower quickly and easily, thank you very much💯💯💯💯💯👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Where’s the lubricant?
great job, do you have to shut water off?
Great video.  Thank you.  Clear, concise instruction.
You forgot the 'Faucet Grease' (Sold at the 'Orange'  Home Improvement store).  BEFORE re-inserting the cartridge, make sure you apply Faucet Grease to the rubber parts on the cartridge and the O-ring(s). If you don't, the cartridge will tend to stick inside the brass housing (where the cartridge goes into the valve assembly). and over time will be harder to turn the handle to regulate the water flow, and wear down the rubber parts on the cartridge.  I know, I had that problem, so APPLY THE FAUCET GREASE, just don't put grease in the holes on the cartridge.
Thanks for the video.. money saver..
Thank you so much for the video I was able to fix my bathroom thank a lot 🔥🔥🙌🏼
Thank you for the step by step installation after 13 years. . I just replaced my 20 years old shower faucet. It was very challenging taking down the old cartridge and putting the clip back in but I made it by viewing your video several times . Great video and my learning experience!❤
Great help, thanks.  Saved me $700 on a Sunday.  Where do I send the check?
thank you for saving me hundreds of dollars. god bless
I just found the valve and tool on Amazon for $28!!
Mine was stuck in the rough valve. I used the extractor tool but it ended up breaking the cartridge. I called two plumbers and they never responded so I ended up chipping it out with a hammer and a 1/4” chisel. I was as careful as I could be to not gouge the brass and fortunately I did not. Once I got past the two rubber side pieces of the 1222 I was able to pull the remaining part out with a needle nose pliers. Cleaned it up with a toothbrush and some CLR then flushed it out really good with water. The first 1222 that I reinstalled was faulty - maybe my fault, not sure - I did twist it slightly in both directions as I was installing it - maybe that ruined the O ring. The second one I installed I did not twist at all - just pushed it in pulses and it slowly went in. I used the extractor tool to help push it in the last 3/8” or so. No leaks. Works nice and smooth now. And don’t hesitate to call Moen for a free replacement - they’ll ask you some basic questions and want a photo and they’ll send you one for free 5-7 business day shipping though (unless you pay extra). So glad I didn’t pay $350 for a plumber - chipping it out was relatively easy - only took 10 mins or so.
A lot of good help here. Mine took a lot longer but got it done.  Rubber gasket on cold side of original came off and jammed the whole thing trying to get it out. Perserverance and Ramonasplumber video got it out finally. Similar problem going back in-didn't want to seat far enough for clip. Greased it up helped and knocked it in the last 3mm with a punch. Good detail he stated-push it with the body not the stem. Otherwise not flush on back side.   Stupid rubber gasket on the hot of the new one wanted to come out too. Last one was there for 20 years, hopefully this will too and I won't be the guy fixing the next time.. Idiots who built the place did not make access easy. I'd wear mechanics gloves next time to avoid the blood. LOL.
Just saved me a 2 or $300 plumbing bill. (Not that I have anything against plumbers!)
the plastic behind my handle broke and the problem is i don't even know what model it is so dunno if i bought the right parts. don't wanna pop it out without the right parts on hand. especially since the tub doesn't even have it's own shutoff.
2/15/24: Sir,  (I hope ur still around, been this is NOW, after COVID), I would like to thank you, now, still for this video. Because you gave some great info, and tips about this MOEN valve, that no other has mention. On, my Moen valve similar to this one here, it, only turns on the HOT water. And the handle will not go any further ccw from the down OFF position it was in. So I think I will try to ROTATE,  the Stem, 180 degrees, and see if that will help. I thank you again. (I survive covid too, for now 68 and counting).
Can't hear a word with volume at max
I know nothing about plumbing!  You explained how it works and how to fix in a very easy-to-follow manner - thanks!
Hi, Thank you for making this video and explaining everything in detail. My old cartridge is upside down where the “HC” part is on the bottom and hot water comes out first. Would rotating the brass stem 180 degrees fix the issue or do I need to pull out the cartridge and rotate it so the “HC” part is on top?
I was about replace my valve tomorrow and decided to take it apart tonight.  The stop limiter you described was my whole problem.  Thank you so much for talking about because mine was set to a weird position with my handle turning both directions.
you didnt apply the lube/grease on the new valve
Can you fix my shower!!  The handle came off on its own, we are in Orlando Florida
You forgot to mention the lube that comes with the OEM cartridge but other than that good video.
Brass is only a few $ More than plastic Atm... Any reason not to upgrade to brass beside cost?
wow you make it look look so easy, my pipes are 10 year olds so going to try on the weekend, got shutoff values so worst case i shower in the kitchen sink til a plumber fixes it....thanks
HOW to turn off the water? I am having this problem RIGHT NOW and you never mention HOW to turn off the water. Help Please.
And he did it all with a long sleeved white shirt!!
I have to agree with so many of the comments in that it takes a special talent to now only know a trade, but be able to explain it so that it can understood by someone not in the profession being taught.   From your video, I was able to complete the repair with no issue. I did find the valve at a little cal Ace Hardware for $53. I thankfully did not need any additional tools to remove the old valve.   Thanks for taking the time to teach.
THANKS MR CLEAN!!
I LOVE HOW YOU EXPLAINED PROPERLY INTO FRIENDLY DIY. THANK YOU!
Great instructions.  Bravo.👍👏👏🎖
What a great teacher! Thanks man
This is the second time in 6 years that I needed to replace the Moen cartridge. Unfortunately I managed to strip the Allen screw. I wonder if I can just drill it out and sacrafice the surrounding parts. I was planning to install the much more expensive brass cartridge.
What repair kit do I need or video for slide forward to turn on side to side for hot /cold to stop leaking or replace parts needed. Thanks.
Thanks.  This was exactly what I have as well as the exact problem getting it out.  What would I do without you?
First plumber wearing a  non casual shirt…ok.
Really appreciated. Explained like eating chocolate .
Thank you
😁👋thank you very much sir , excellent video,very helpful thank you for sharing and your time u explain very clearly 😅appreciate,God blessed you 👍👏👏👏👏👏Bravo, u save us some money $😅😁
This is the best video on this topic on YouTube.
Excellent video ... Appreciate you so much!
How do you know which cartridge to buy if you don’t take it out first
Agree with others,  this is definately one of the best video for all DIYers. Thank you.
Don't you have to dry the whole and lube the new cartridge before inserting?
Thank you so much my first plumbing DIY  and my second DIY ever. Thank you for mentioning all the tips and the possible problems. The only video that addressed what to do if u installed the cartridge right but the still there is a problem a simple 180 degree turn and voilà . Thank u
excellent video definitely gives me the confidence to do this project . mine is a moen also but w regular knob handle  so a Philips screwdriver should remove knob no Allen key . il see next week .. awesome video
Great instructions, my kids broke mine, and it was easy to follow this instruction and replace. I found tools from my toolbox that did that job, so I know save a couple hundred bucks. Thank you
Thank you for including the info relating to "if the position is opposite of desired......"
Thank you.
Nice demo
This tutorial saved me so much money! Thank you!
This little goodie ☺️
I got a free cartridge. Guy at the hardware store said moen warranties parts so everyone paying for cartridges are getting ripped off
Thanks for the video. Question: how to find out which model to buy a new cartridge ?
This was very informational. I have a broken diverter valve I know now thank you.
😂😂 pause it @ 8:15, then 8:41
Thank you this is great much appreciated
Thank you so much
I love this guy
I have been trying to figure out why my hot water is coming out first after replacing the shower knob...thank you for explaining what I need to do to ensure cold water comes out first!!
This was really an awesome posting, you took great time and explaining everything. I appreciate it, and it looks like everyone else here does as well!
This is the same model that I have, does anybody know the model number so I can match replacement parts for it? I'd appreciate it!
One question. Towards the end when you say if the water is not cold when you turn it on, to take the brass stem and turn 180°.    It was OFF. You rotated 180° and it still stayed OFF.   How was this possible? The main water lines were still ON yet no water came out when you rotated 180°.  How? When I say OFF I mean no water is coming out of the faucet.
This is exactly what I was looking for. Perfectly detailed and thorough instructions. And they were all spot on. Thank you!
Don't use any aftermarket you will be going back. If it is hard to out put screw in stem. Use a 2x4 and claw hammer as a puller. Just go slow
Just watched this video at 7 pm July 24, 2023. VERY HELPFUL! Thank you so much!
Do you have to shit the water off at your house to do this?
How do I know what cartridge I need to buy for my Moen faucet? Are there different model numbers?
I was wondering if that screw would fly off the driver. Good video though and amusingly presented.
Home Hardware in ontario Canada gave me the cartridge free because they told us moen faucets were a lifetime warranty. I bought the puller for $45+tax at the same store.
Thanks to your video I was able to switch out the core and replace it with a new one …  First time I had ever attempted to do it . Thanks again! SUCCESS!!
You didn't lubricate the two rubber pieces on the sides of the valve. The valve should have come with a small packet of silicone, and it's important to put a liberal quantity on those gaskets.
4:25  Collar just slides right out?? how about a 30-year old valve with well-water deposits. I think I'll have to break it  off and buy a new one. These video are excellent for newly--installed plumbing.
What’s the size of that Allen key?
Thanks great videos 👍👍👍
Thanks for the help! I managed to pull the cartridge with a pair of pliers so I needed to buy the part which was $40 at my local hardware store. I have a question though. Why does the faucet make a really loud noise when I'm turning it to hot water? It's so loud that the tub shakes. But it goes completely quiet once I change it to the shower head
7.5 M views. So many people have plumbing problems.
I knew you were a real plumber at 8:40
Thank you so much
My boi
Do I have to shut the water off?
Help! I thought I had the exact handle, but the little handle doesn’t have a screw to take it off! Only the two big screws. It’s stuck like it still has a screw in it, but I have stared at this thing for thirty minutes and there aren’t any more screws!
U know nothing
Can You Do It ?  YES You Can And I Can Help.
Thanks!!!! I just changed mine by following your video!!!!! Just an update 53.98 for the Moen Cartridge at home depot.
Why no grease?
If u break the top and bottom tabs off the cartridge little tool that comes with the cartridge that can spin 360 and pull out with your channel locks my puller is still in the package I am a plumber 44yrs as of now.
thank you
MY STEM IS BROKEN AND NOW ITS FLUSH ... HOW DO I TAKE IT OUT WITH NO STEM?
How do you know which Moen cartridge is the right one for the job?  I see there are many different cartridges available for a Moen shower/tub valve.
It must be nice using new parts for your video.  I have replaced mine twice so far and both times it's been a struggle. Used the removal took which had no effect on loosing or removal and just stripped out the plastic cartridge. Took close to 4 1/2  hours of carefully trying to pry and pull until it finally broke in half. Then I got a drill out and carefully drilled into the plastic body and used needle nose pliers to break up the cartridge and remove it in pieces. Then cleaned up the housing before before lubricant and reinstalling.
Excellent tutorial. However.....Take your old cartridge with you when you go to get a new one. I did not and found out Moen has at least 6 different sizes.
Thank you for the help!  I didn't think I could do this myself till I watched your video.
Thank you for the video. Saved us a plumber service call.  And no more leak. We were dripping 3 5 gallon buckets a day.
Do you teach sir in person?
Isn't there lube or grease that comes with the cartridge to apply before reinstalling?
Thank you soo much for this video sir! U da Man!
Very clear
This should be way easier to do 5:12
Thank you. You were a HUGE help. I did it!!! 😊
Thank You ‼️
What’s the name of this cartridge? I can’t seem to find it.
Excellent!
You saved me a call to the plumber sir thank you!!! Great video!!!
I got quoted for $380. Which is I find so crazy. YouTube saved me money. Only spent $58.00 in the year 2023 with my 9 yr old. Fixed it in 28 mins done, water is running again.
Thanks
Wow thanks
That was very thorough and quite good…thx!
How many puller stiles are in the market
Great video.
I got my finger stuck in that hole and it’s because there was a burr inside I had to rip my finger to get it back out so I wouldn’t suggest putting your finger in that hole. I would just hit it with a brass brush about the same size as the hole.
OK sir.  (The history) The plumber came in because we were having an issue with the  Faucet head (no leak) and when they came in they pulled out the old cartridge and destroyed it in the process. So they had to get a new one (fyi old cartridge was hc on the bottom). they came back and put a new 1 on the right side up guess what it's leaking.  A drip about every 30 seconds. They came back and took it out,  putting it back in so it should be fine again,  right side up. I said I think it needs to go in the other way. They said if we have a problem still with the dripping they'll come back and they'll do it the other way.  They did have to come back cause it was still dripping. They did it the other way still dripping. Went and got a new cartridge still dripping. And what they told me to call back in a week. It dripped all week. They came back and changed The moen cartridge again. This would be cartridge number 3 (the original and the 2nd new one).  Remember the 1st one was not dripping.  They said there was nothing they could do and they left. I called another plumber he changed the cartridge... still leaking and refused to come back.   I then after a week went and turned it upside down...still leaking.  Called moen they sent me a new cartridge because they can't think of any other reason why it would be leaking.  I'm concerned cause I don't think this will resolve it so I'm asking you if you have any idea before I go do this process if there is anything else I should be checking for. 3 plumbers and moen and no one has had an answer for me 3 yrs now. You are the 1st 1 to say if the cartridge is in upside down put it back in upside down. So I ask you do you have any ideas?
Thank you
Great video.  We had no idea what to do when our tub just wouldnt turn off.  We turned it off at the street, followed your directions, and got it fixed in about an hour with 2 trips to Home Depot: one for the puller, one for the new device.  Thank you so much!
Awesome 👍
You saved my life thanks Sr👌🏽👌🏽
Moen gives you all the parts for free. Can you just call them or you can go through the website and I’ll help you troubleshoot and figure out which parts you need and send them for free
Fantastic Video!
“Hey question for you,  can we use two fingers in the hole?”
its the two old rubber got to watch out. They rotated sometimes(debris). And fall into valve hole(hot/cold)🧐 🧐 Thank You!!! 👍👍👍👍
Yes!! Watched your video last night, and replaced the cartridge this morning. This video was very helpful. Thank you!!!!
What size key?
best thing i ever bght!!!!
what should i do if that brass thing broke, and i dont have anything to pull? mine broke to the inside of the cartrige.. please help
(cartridge)
Pull port
I ran into every possible problem he stated. Cartridge wouldn't come out.  Then it broke while pulling it out.  Then water temperature was opposite.   This video made the process easy. And got over those obstacles easily.  Definitely wouldn't have been able to complete this project without this video.   Thank you so much
One thing I noticed, from watching other videos so far, is he didn't put on plumber's grease. Might be important. But otherwise a very informative video. Thanks.
Will replacing this cartridge resolve any bypass issues I am having? When I run a hot water faucet on my first floor the water comes out hot but takes a long time. Even if it was just run only about 5 - 10 minutes later it comes out warm for about 10 seconds then turns cold again for about 30 seconds before it gets hot again. Based on some other videos it appears I might have a by pass issue with my first floor shower valve. I am installing some isolation valves tomorrow to verify this, but just wondering if I will need to replace the entire fixture if the tests do show this valve is the culprit.
I have a problem with my shower valve. I doesnt fully open the pipes until its turned all the way. Which means the only way to get full water pressure is when its scorching hot. Anyone know how to fix this?
Very useful video I fixed the problem thank you so much!!
Thanks for the video.
Well should have ...the job cost me 493 $
Oh it's OK. I'm calling a plumber for sure 😆
Super helpful. Very thankful for this
Very imformative video! This was a great video presentation. Very easy to hear and great camera angles.
My house was built in 2004. My leaky faucet looks just like this. But how do you know the correct cartrdige before you pull it all apart. Mine is same just different handle
THANKS! REALLY HELPED 👍🏽👍🏽
Me am professional!
8:40 very satisfying...
HELLO.THERE ARE OTHER CART'S BESIDES moen
My right ear enjoyed this video
Thank you. You made a job that seemed intimidating pretty straight forward. I replaced one cartridge and flipped another that was installed incorrectly when our house was built. Now it goes from cold to hot like it is supposed to.
Very good explanation. Thanks Sir. For that video
Thank you so much. We weren’t sure how to stop the leak and your video was so helpful. We kept going back and watching certain parts again until we got everything right. Shower is working correctly and the leak stopped! Yay!! Thanks so much!!
I can't get the handle off. The Allen wrench goes in, but it n won't turn.
Sir, if you have any contact with the MOEN ENGINEERING design office of single handle hot/cold shower valves: suggest to them to have stainless steel barrel/s and surfaces were the valve required sliding or rotating parts.  Choosing “brass” in part of the valve is the real factor for a rapid degradation/leaking water at the mixing shower valve/shower head due to the elastomers membranes in the valve failing to seal.  Cause of water dripping: With a yearly repeated rotation and sliding of the shower valve handle ”silicon elastomers, sealing membrane/ O-rings” on a rough/corroded  brass surfaces  the sealing  is compromise and the valve/tap start to leak.  The brass barrel/s surface/s and ports become corroded due to water pressure flow and chemical oxidization: therefore the silicon/neoprene/etc. membrane/ O-rings no longer perform the sealing 100% and the tap and the shower head begin to drip. It will be a waste of time and money, to “pretend” of refurbishing a leaking shower valve, if a visual inspection of the surfaces of the barrel and ports are not smooth or have corroded surfaces. As it is for most cases of household plumbing and applications, the choice of metal alloys, elastomers and plastic parts (Valve sheet of Engineering Specifications and Warranties. ) are the real life warranty of the product/s we buy.  ( Or, in time, be prepare to have a little plastic bucket to collect the drip.)  Conclusion: It is up to the customer to choose for the house taps/valves with operating surfaces and moving parts made with materials, metal alloy, plastic, elastomers, involved in the operation of the valves that are , immune to degradation from pressure and chemical corrosion.  Buying product manufactured with stainless steel and ceramic, were needed it, is at long term good investment and money saving …when it comes to Plumbing. As the saying goes: Right the first time all the time.  (Present technologies of manufacturing Valve for household needs offer a variety of superb engineering, with components that indeed last a life time.) Respectfully and Greetings… Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year of Peace and Prosperity to you and to all.  Paul Candiago (candiago.p@bmts.com)
Great video, thank you.  Very informative. I was able to complete the change within a few minutes after getting the parts.
Thanks for the video, I was really helpful. I would like to know what size Allen wrench you used to remove the handle?
Before inserting the new  valve lube up all o rings and rubber parts on the valve. ( they give you a small packet of lube in with the new valve )  Will make it easier to remove next time. Thanks for the video.  Posted 12/11/2022
what if the bolt to take your handle off is completely stripped =s
Thankyou
Perfect... worked like a charm. Thanks!
what if that brass stem on the cartridge broke off? That's what I'm dealing with and I can't seem to find a way to pull the old cartridge out. Tool or no tool. There's nothing for the screw to go into....
that was awesome!  thanks.
When I watch the video in the full screen! The sound volume is much lower! Hard to hear that! Can you fix that? Thank you!
8:45😂😂😂 looks like 🫣🫢
Great video, helped a lot but I'd like to describe an experience that I had doing this. I called Moen for the free replacement for my Positemp valve. It came promptly and I finally got the nerve to do it. I spent almost an hour getting the old one out. It was about 14 years old and with the help of this and other videos, a heat gun and some WD40, it finally released. I put the new one in, properly aligned, got everything back together and when I turned the water back on, something was wrong. Turning the valve counter clockwise, I'd get cold, then off, then hot. Holy crap! What did I do? None of the vids that I watched covered this. The cartridges looked exactly the same. I called Moen and explained my situation and they promptly sent another. When I compared the newest cartridge with the other "new" cartridge, they looked the same but numbers at the back near the O-ring were different. I can only surmise that I got the wrong cartridge the first time. The second replacement went smoothly, but not without  a little bit of anxiety. Hopefully, this will help anyone who might find themselves in the same situation.
Thanks for the help. Since 58 year old lady DIY the valve and all is great thanks to the excellent instructions and tips!
great video, sadly after i changed the cartridge, i now have a  very small drip when the tap is off.
Also, you didn't show adding silicon lubricant to the control valve and to the valve body prior to putting the new control valve in place. Did you use the silicone or simply forget to video the application? The application?
Great video Thank you!!  How can you drive determine the make of the valve!?? Is it on the escutcheon?? If not, is it on the cartridge??  Also, what is the best soccer for a valve puller??
The phucks with the low volume
Thanks a bunch that video made me feel confident enough to take on the project myself I otherwise would have wasted money on a plumber great job and thanks again
Great information,  but very idealistic.  If you have hard water and it hasn't been replaced in 20 years,  it will probably break when using the puller. When this happened to me,  I drilled out the core. I drilled, pulled with needle nose pliers, used a flat head screw driver to break up plastic.  1.5 hours later being careful not to damage the valve, I got all old parts out.
I live in Canada  where many Moen faucet parts, including cartridges, have a lifetime warranty. I've taken 25 year old cartridges to Home Depot and asked for the FREE lifetime warranty replacement, and have been given them.  It seems you do have to ask for this FREE replacement as it is not voluntarily mentioned to you at the store. I'm not sure if Moen has discontinued this lifetime warranty as my Moen faucets are from the early 1980's.
very straightforward,helpful video 👍
Thank you for the video
if you dont turn the water off when changing the cartridges (but you turned off the water at the valve at the tub), will water still possibly start exploding out?
Thank you for being so amazing!!! My faucet in my master bathroom was running and wouldn't stop! With your help and your video, I was able to fix my faucet! Thanks for saving me hundreds of dollars!
Thank you so much for creating this repair video. Your very precise instructions enabled me to repair my shower valve with the right knowledge and tools needed to perform this correctly. Thank you!!!
I would not advise this unless you have dedicated shutoff valves for your shower.  Especially with the older metal Moen cartridges the inner core may separate leaving the outer part of the cartridge stuck in the valve body.  The reason is the core removal took just pulls on the center core.  Removal at that point generally is beyond what a plumber would attempt, and they will recommend replacing the valve which usually means demolition of part of the wall for access..  Other videos will show you advanced techniques to address that without replacing the valve body.  Meanwhile, with dedicated shutoffs to the shower you will still have water supply in the residence.
Thank you for your service, your video was very informative and helpful.
I Replaced My Cartridge And It Still Leaks From The Tub Faucet . Help ?
I have changed three time cartages ,,But shower no stop drippings .it my question
Thank you so much for this video. It seems this is the exactly the same one as in my bathroom. I plan to repair my leaking shower faucet. Can I ask which specific model code for this faucet? I found the screw was missing, but I don’t know where to get a replacement.
Cheaper and less tools needed to just replace whole faucet
Wow u just saved me money
ThNk you for making this video. I have made 3 trips to Ace hardware, and cussed a lot but I have completed the mission
so we did all that and the thing still drips. now what
the video was great, thank you for taking the time saved me time and energy.
Thank you so much! Fixed my son's shower without any problems. Can't thank you enough.
2nd person down stole the words right out my mouth... out of all the video.  This one did it.. thanks 1000...
Before you install the new cartridge put a little bit of plumbers grease on all the rubber areas
Help my handle stuck after removing the Allen screw now what
Xlnt! 🤙🏼🍻 diy video
I did it; I'm the hero of the house and the weekend no less! At first, I was going to give up, because, you are right, a plumber can be cheaper after I mess it up. But since it happened on Saturday morning, it would mean Tuesday with no shower. Thanks to you, I accomplished the job and saved about $200.00.  Thank you for your great video.
What if there stem is snapped at the base?
Great video.  I never did this before but you have all the necessary info.  I did end up needing the puller too.  You also have good close up shots.  Thanks
The first time I had this Moen valve fail in the on position, I called a plumber. He charged me $700+, and over the course of 3 visits... cut a hole in the wall behind the bathroom (another $500 to repair), to attempt to de-weld and replace the entire valve.   I begged him to please just try replacing the cartridge moments before his plan to break through the tile inside the shower for another go at de-welding the valve from the inside.  He told me that 90% of the time, replacing the cartridge alone doesn't work, hence his attempt to destroy my house.  Ultimately, he ended up replacing the cartridge, after nearly lighting the house on fire trying to de-weld the old valve out completely.   The second time this happened in the other bathroom, I followed this video and replaced the valve by myself from the front.  It worked. It cost me the cartridge and the valve puller, so like $55 + $27, and 30 minutes.  Really appreciate the time you spent making these videos.  We don't all grow up with handy dads, so it's great to have access to someone else's.
Props to Home Depot for actually carrying the tool..
Great video…got cartridge changed with no issues, thank you.
why did you not remove the cover  plate? not a plumber?
Thank you very much.  Very clear instruction for dummies
I am able to find diagnostic for my fault in Shower mixer. This video help me to find damage part and how to replace it.  Great 😊
Moen will send you free replacement cartridges.   It’ll take a week, but their products have a lifetime warranty so no need to buy one unless it’s gushing water.
What the name part that you replaced it?
Could not have changed this stem without watching your video.  Thank you
Any ideas if the screw for the alley wrench is stripped, it's so small u cant proceed without taking the handle off.?
Thank you !!! Live saver 🙌
It's been clear and helpful. Thanks
excellent video very helpful👍🏾👍🏾
Thank you so much! I live in a rural area, and we had to shut off all our water since this tub valve got stuck on! Soonest a plumber could come out here was in 3 weeks. Picked up the part at the local hardware store, and followed your instructions. All is well again. One thought, I didn't have a core puller, and mine was stuck pretty good. So I pulled it out just a bit, then sprayed WD-40 all around the inside. Then pushed and pulled the core a couple times, and it popped right out. Hope that piece of advice can help someone else out there. Also, my core kit came with some grease for the rubber gaskets to ease installation (looks like some Vaseline is all). I cleaned mine out using just some vinegar (which I let sit for a half hour) and a simple green kitchen scrubbing pad.
Mine doesn’t have the screw under the fossit, any ideas how to remove it? Thanks.

If the brass stem that the handle screws to broke off on my currently installed cartridge,the tool will be useless to buy since the tool rod threads into the brass stem,correct and if this is the case,can the cartridge still be removed with channel locks because you pulled on the stem with channel locks before then having to use the tool instead and since my stem is broken off inside that white plastic piece,that white piece is gonna be the only thing I can get ahold of with channel locks for an attempt at pulling it out. The thought of paying $100+ for the entire valve assembly plus going through the trouble of desoldering the pipes from the old one then sweating the fittings of the new valve to the pipes is really depressing. The faucet would continue dripping regardless of which position the handle was in when off,but when I rotated the handle past 360°,the valve stem broke off with the handle and now water squirts out from inside of that white plastic piece and runs down onto the floor.
Why didn't you put any KY on the shaft when you put it back in even some vasoline
Very helpful 👌👏👏👏
Saved me a ton of money sir!  Thanks much.
Yep, this is how you do it. I've had to replace one of my carts due to debris getting in the line. At that point I had the lightweight puller (probably from Home Depot) and it barely got the cart free. Those are too flimsy if your cart has been in a long time. Since then I found one of the really good heavy pullers at a garage sale for a few dollars. I always grease the new cart to put it in. I also oil the setscrew when reinstalling it as well.
That cartridge puller thing is not 100$
Thank you my friend! Our shower handle broke today I watched your video and it just needed a cartridge replacement! It now works perfectly! Thank you so much!!!
If you are repairing an older Moen shower valve - this is the video to watch.  Especially the last few minutes when he describes how to test the hot/cold water.  Moen part number 1222 was the right cartridge for my repair.  Get the puller - it is worth the 15$ at HD.
I know you made this a long time ago but you helped me so much with this video.  I brought all the tools and followed your instructions exactly and my daughter's shower is now fixed. Thank you!
Thanks. Excellent video
Thanks! This really help!
Any advice for the sound like hammering or something similar on the shower valve ?? Thank you.
Outstanding video! Just changed out my cartridge and it was a piece of cake after watching this!
My handle is really hard to turn off and leaks.  Is this a cartridge problem?
Good video!  Does the Keystop play a role in the water pressue!?!  Ours is not pushing water with enough pressure ,specially when I have to move it to the MIDDLE to avoid getting burned!  What is the remdey?
I have the valve puller but how do I identify which valve model to replace??   Home Depot has only the valve Model #1222. Thanks!
Worked like a charm! Thank you so much!! Very helpful.
Help! My shower is dripping worse than before! How can I fix it?
Thats all wrong buddy
To clarify if you have the hot coming on first you need to flip the whole stem, the plastic part that says HC on it 180 degrees, this requires removing the clip.  I did turn the water back off, just in case.  The stem is now 38 for generic or 45 for moen and the tool is under 20.  Plumber wont walk in you door for under a hundred, plus parts.  Great video
Thank You this helped me!
Thank you.  Was able to replace my own following thei video
Too much talking ...
For the algorithm 🤓🥳💪👏🤙🤔😎
No audio after the ads.
Why is the handle so far away from the base?   Is it supposed to be like that
Well..what happens when it s
Where can I find the model number? or do I bring the cartridge to Home Depot and ask them to assist me  in getting the correct cartridge?  I am just afraid that they might be out of stock or  force to go to a specialized store selling faucets and parts?
You forgot to tell us to cover the drain valve to keep from losing small parts from the valve that might fall in there. Otherwise, it’s an excellent video.
This is the same model on my shower, but the issue I'm having is that the "off" position of the handle is no longer in the proper position (six o'clock).   I have removed the handle and reset it to the correct position, and it will turn on once just fine... But when I try to turn it off again the handle feels like it "jumps" the stopper somehow and then the only way to turn the water off is by turning the handle counterclockwise to the nine o'clock position.   Is there something stripped in the mechanism that isn't catching properly?
What is the part number u used? Was it the Moen #1222(?)
Excellent video!  Instructions were perfect
Thank you so much for sharing this video instruction, 🙏🏽😁💖it helped us change our shower cartridge and everything is working perfectly again! as long as we followed what you said to a T we were able to make it work!  You are wonderful
Poor video, didnt help at all. No product codes or what he was working on from the start. Be warned this isnt a video for a moen posi handle.
Thanks for the Video! I got it done, no leaks. So one thing that wasn't covered is if you have to turn the water off to your whole house, let the water company do it, especially if the valve seems stuck, because if you break it, you pay them $400-$700. I had them come out and they said it was a good idea because 'it's about to go'. They had to use a small sledge hammer to loosen it. It's a pain to have them come out twice, but shouldn't be a charge because it's considered as an emergency repair if you are fixing a leak in your house.
This was a good vid. My hot water comes out first on one of my showers. No idea if it's a moen positemp though.
Thanks for the video!
Thank you.  You added the missing details that I needed to complete the job.
omg he was right! I can do it! And I did! 😃
Very good video that walks you thru repairing a Moen faucet. Step by step. Thank You
Thanks
Thanks, that is a great video.  Very helpful and closeup.
Replaced my 1222 Moen cartridge because I had a continual drip from the shower head.  After replacement, I still have the same drip. Any idea or suggestion as to what else may be causing the drip?
Excellent
Thank you!!!
Like bob the  builder can we fix? yes we can.
7/64 Allen key for hande use blaster or equivalent to loosen. Screw has a shallow head ,easy to strip.
Thank you for the knowledge, I got mine done today due to shower head leaking thanks to your video.  Cartridge was 55 bucks and tool was 16. The only issue I ran into which was why I think it was in need of replacing was the rubber seals on the left and right side seem to be torn apart which caused the cartridge to get stuck half way out. I just twisted and turned while applying quite a bit of force which slowly but surely popped the value out. I had to remove the pieces of rubber seal which were left behind. The valve went back into place a lot easier than it came out. Took about 10 minutes tops.
Great video.  What a "DIY-how to" video should be.   Thanks for sharing.
Thank you! Your video saved me grief, money, and time!!!! Did the repair myself and I feel.like I accomplished something!
What normal person has all this stuff
He forgot to grease the o-rings...
I JUST REPLACED A 1225 MOEN VALVE AND IT WORKS FINE BUT THE VALVE WILL TURN ALL THE WY AROUND OVER AND OVER DOESN'T STOP, WHAT WOULD CAUSE THIS?
Thanks for sharing. On a side note - you forgot to wear a tie - important part in plumbing :)
I did this! Sadly I had another bath that had the same problem last fall. Plumber charged me $240. I repaired my second one for only the price of a new cartridge $40. THANK YOU!
THANK YOU, Sir!!! Excellent video!!!   Don W., OH
Thank you! 👍🏿👍🏿
Thanks for posting👍🏼.
The center screw is hard to come out. Any suggestions
Thank you so much for this video ❤️
Great video,  very clear . However,  had trouble taking off the handle after taking off the allen screw ....any idea , should i bang it off ....ive taken it out 10yrs ago... Started to drip after 10yrs ... But today i decided to fix it. But handle didn't want to come ....
Nice work but what if the Allen bolt in the handle won’t budge? First time I’ve seen a plumber in a clean white shirt! Thanks
What size allen do I need for the handle screw?
Freaking hate that you have to replace the valve to do a freaking cosmetic update. Moen -> Pfister. SMH, cooperate greed at its finest.
(manual puller)
Thanks Sir 👍!
ave a handle with a screw hole in the middle on the front of the handle, not the top or bottom, that I cant get it off. I can't find any tool to go in the hole and latch onto anything. How would you suggest I get it off?
If the cartridge is stuck, could one have a helper turn on the water to the house while you stand ready with a big bucket or towel for the cartridge to explosively shoot out and spray water everywhere? Just have the helper ready to quickly shut the water back off. I ended up fixing what I suspect is the original 1966 Moen standard cartridge (my house was built in 1966). The cartridge is free if you call Moen customer service (plus free shipping). You can buy the clear plastic handle for $19 and the escutcheon for $25, both on Amazon. The Moen cartridge comes pre-greased and after replacement, I could then turn the handle with my pinky finger. I live in the SF Bay area so a cartridge replacement would cost a few hundred dollars. Many years ago the go-to pluming company with the really great Yelp review charged ~$500 to clear a normal clog in the drain line to our kitchen by using the foot operated drain auger which every plumbing company uses. I define a normal kitchen clog as a grease clog and using 50 feet or less of cable to reach the clog if entering under the sink. I still consider this to be a fair price in the pre-Covid days in the SF Bay area, however prices for the skilled trades have gone up substantially since then which is why DIY skills are such an important skill now.
This helped me on every level. Thank you!
Thank you so much I now fix the shower for my family at home withought paying a plumber cost 1000 last time my son broke the handle this is easier and cheaper thank you so much God bless you
does a new fixture you are replacing come with the cartridge and everything you need to replace it if I just go buy the some one I already have?
Thank you for the great instructions. The cartridge was tough to pull out. Not as easy as the video made it seem. Thanks!
Just do the work holy shit it's a shower head. U will never need a puller. This guys a roofer
Yep and it's free glad man
U don't need any of that shit🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
8:50 is what we came here for. You’re welcome.
Perfect! Thank you for the straight-forward guidance. Could not have done it without you!!
Thank you so much!
Baldy is kinda cute, i might have to call him for my plumbing lol
Well made video and great visuals! I know very little about plumbing and was able to fix our shower valve. The hardest part was reattching the freaking handle with the tiny wrench!
Oh please, 100 for that, 75 for this, plus labor plus who knows what! I'm not replacing engine in my car! I know you need to make money but don't rip off people
what  a  great video , you are indeed a lifesaver thank you so much
I have a moen three handle shower faucet.   I can’t get the wall tube off!! Any ideas?
Good to know.  Thank You!
My friend had me look ar his men shower valve because he's not getting any or very little water coming from head
Guess it’s my turn to fix our shower! If I can do a timing chain on a car this should be a walk in the park …should be knock on wood!!!
My temperature limiter stop is metal on an old moen shower control is stuck . Any ideas on best way to remove it. I had to drill out the Allen screw to get the handle off . Installed in 1995.
Moen valves=trash. Great video but hopefully ppl stop buying and if you have the cash for a remodel ditch them.
Watch from 8:39 to skip to the main part. Your house needs a bit of love just like everything else
Thanks for this video, we saved paying plumber $120 by looking at this video. Just purchased cartridge and puller from Home Depot and followed the steps on this video.
Thanks, Amigo!
Excellent video. I was able to successfully change the cartridge in very little time. I did not require the core remover. Thank you very much.
Camera doesn’t shoe enough details when pointed to exact areas that needs to take apart or to unscrew things But thank you for sharing
Hello all, I have a moentrol single handle shower valve. When I pull it, it creates a noise which you can hear in the video on the link below. The video is just 5 seconds. Then it goes away. If I push it to stop the water flow and pull it back, it won't create a noise second time. It happens once after no use. The shower is in the second floor, there are other faucets in the second floor but there is no noise when I turn them on. Can anyone tell me what might be the problem and how to solve it? Thanks   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7jq07VNul4
This is an excellent video
How the heck did people survive without youtube? I never would have been confident enough to try this on my own.
Very in depth video, the plumber doesn't run through areas when fixing the faucet; he does a really thorough explanation of how to fix the faucet.
thanks teacher
You need to set the limits 120° and no hotter . My is at 100° .
Thanks, No Audio ?
Your video helped me fix my tub valve. Thank youuu so so much! It was easyyyy.
Works great, looks great.
great video with straight forward instructions.  Do you have any suggestion on loosening the setscrew holding that holds the handle on.  Mine appears to be seized!
what do you do if the screw for the handle is stuck and covered with water residue?
Info on how to determine which cartridge you will need  would be helpful. So that you can have it on hand. Good Video.
I have a problem with my shower making a whistling noise: why is that?  I should say,  its used for visitors.
The tool to pull out the valve is only $15. Lol!
Many thanks sir. 👍🏾
I think it'll just be cheaper to fly you out here to California and not take any risks. Are you available Monday?
Thx. This is one of the first (if not the first) DIY plumbing jobs that i have done on our home. Was a success and has helped to make me feel capable of handling other things that may come up.
Video was very helpful. However my facet only turns to the 9 o’clock position for hot water. The limitor is in the straight up position. How do I get it to function properly?
Thank you very much!
Wow, awesome video and was able to help me fix my shower. All of our plumbers are backed up for weeks and this was a lifesaver.
Very professional done.  How much for a job like this.  Install and Parts.  Thanks
What a GREAT video!  Perfectly explained for a new guy rebuild a handle! ❤️🏆
I screwed up my plumbing because of your half assed tutorial.
This video is terrible.  It is an absolutely awful tutorial.
THANK YOU. YOUR VIDEO HELPED SAVE ME MONEY AND DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO FIX.
screw size & type??
Did exactly what you said and it worked.. had to use two pliers one loosening the valve and the other pulling the stem.. it slowly came out. Thank you for your great and wise explanation.. Went to my local home hardware and they gave me the part.. Moen has great lifetime warranty.
Do you always do plumbing in dress clothesm
Your an ANIMAL   MR FIX!
This video just helped me replaced the cartridge after more than a decade!!!!
Thank you 🙏 it’s helpful for me 👍🏻👍🏻
These things just suck . They always provide a bit too hot or bit too cold..they stink. I would never put them in MY house. Hot on the left, cold on the right. The old fashioned way.
Ok
Thanks this helped me out a lot tonight.
I have watched it years ago, today I watch again, It's great video Mr. Ramonasplumber,   Thanks so much
Thank you.
Thanks for the video. Successful changed my shower cartridge.
The Book of Revelation predicted videos such as this when it spoke of the explosion of information across the world. I'm in Pasadena fixing my shower because my landlord is a p.o.s. but regardless I fixed it because of this video. God bless you sir. Thank you
Yeah but his watch band is out ? Now what?
100% you did a good job thanks you  I  salute you
👍…great help!!!
good job!
Almost 11 years later and your video is still helping people.  This worked perfectly for me.  Thanks for representing Ramona so well.  Whenever I do need a plumber to come out I know who to call.
Woohoo! Thank you very much!! Successful replacement!
Where is your grease that should be placed on the new cartage ? Comes with a grease pack.. forgot it eh?
I have a  valve exactly like the one that you Working on .On my case there is no hot water coming out  pls give me your feedback and we’re do you buy the tools thank you .
You are for real thank you so much it worked like a charm. You saved me a lot of money so I will like and subscribe. Time to watch football LOL
NOW…I don’t know where Ramonasplumber is located, maybe BORA BORA but up town here the cartrage puller was 16.00 at the local hardware. The cartrage itself was $32.00.
Part number would help greatly
Huge help! Thank you!!!
Thank you for this video! I’m going to try to fix mine following your instructions & will let you know how it turns out. 😊
I appreciate your video. I called a plumber because the Youtube algorithm did not show me this video when I specifically searched for this. Keep it up, and Hey Youtube, get your act together.
It's one thing to be a plumber or another tradesperson, it's an entirely another thing to be able to clearly and succinctly explain how to properly do something.  Very well done!
Great training video.
Thank you very much for the step by step process.. great advice on the puller.. I ended up buying a Danco Core puller for Moen cartridges for $18.98 US at Home depot and it worked perfectly.. Thanks again for the great video.
Thank you.  and God Bless you
Excellent video, really helped
This guys amazing...plumbing wizard
What's the allen wrench size used to unscrew the handle set screw?  Thanks for your video.
I have done this exact replacement twice in the last year for 2 different showers in my house. It’s simple to do if you watch this video and follow the instructions inside the valve box. The puller isn’t $100. I bought one at Home Depot for this exact Moen valve for $14. The Moen valve cost $48. All I needed as far as tools was an Allen wrench, flat head screw driver, Phillips screw driver, puller tool , channel lock pliers and I used needle nosed pliers to pull the pin/clip out. A screw driver would also pop it out. Do yourself a favor and do it yourself. Even if you have to buy every one of the tools I used brand new the cost of the new tools, valve and puller is still cheaper than a plumber it’s an easy fix but make sure you follow all the directions especially don’t forget to put the pin/clip back in to hold the valve in place or when to turn the water back on that valve will come flying out very fast. Put the clip in and slide that metal bracket over the top and your good.
Puller for $100? Lol then that's a huge price mark up.. I just got 1 for $25, in 2021 lol
Thanks to you I was able to replace a cartridge myself.
My landlord tried to tiggten it but loose again
$100 for a Moen extractor tool? What planet are you on? Amazon has them for under $15. This is a max 30 minute job. Don’t pay a plumber $200 for this.
this looks like a terrible design.
👍🙏
What would make the hand valve hard to turn off and on, thank you.
Thank you! Your video made it easy to understand. My shower faucet is fixed for $45 in 20 minutes. Your video is accurate 100% 11 years later!
Before starting place piece of duster over the drainage pipe to protect yourself from missing small parts as screws or bolts...
the cartridge was $20.
how do i know what cartridge to buy and where to buy it. thanks
YOU SIR ARE THE BEST!!! I was about to buy which I could not find a new cartridge & do the whole NEW install. & just @ the end of your video you hit the Bullseye!! My problem was, the person that installed my new shower reversed the process, where it should be cold was hot & UP was OFF. :)
A corporate lawyer comes home from work and sees a plumbers van in his driveway...he thinks, oh f**k I hope it's just an affair
Thank you for posting! Looking at this just proved my faucet was assembled incorrectly!
Thank you for sharing.  My handyman had replaced the faucet but the water is still dripping from the shower head.  Would you please advise what will be the problem?  Thanks
Great video Ramon! Thanks .... I'm going to replace my cartridge next weekend ....
8:40...the wife must be an extremely happy woman...
This kind of faucet is garbage. It costs a fortune to replace and it starts leaking again in 2 to 3 years. Pure scam.
thank you very moch
Very good video. Did you forget to replace the collar?
I watched and you have done a phenomenal job on this video.  I cannot turn water on. Plastic handle turns loosely goosey, doesn't turn anything on. A very very slow drip out of spout. This occurred 8 hours after shower noticing a very very small drip. Going to take Plastic  handle off and see if handle plastic inside  broke and not gripping.. ..then not cartridge.  Otherwise if cartridge..... I'm afraid cartridge won't come out with just plyers because high lime well water and that fixture has been in for 28 years.
Plumber with a long sleeve dress shirt on?????? !!!!!!!!!!
What happens sometimes is the center of the valve comes out leaving the body inside.  Then you get a 1/2" bolt and washers thread the bolt into the valve body using it as a puller
Good video. Thank you for sharing
Thank you Sir.  I appreciate the detailed instructions/demonstration.  They are great!!! I have replaced my guest bathroom Moen 1222 cartridge, now twice, but still having pressure issues with my water from the faucet and shower.  All pieces aligned as you suggested in your video!  Did apply a new double head shower product, but it's the same one as my master bathroom shower.  Full pressure in that bathub/shower. The guest bathroom is actually closer to the garage/hot water heater, so don't think that could be the issue.  The Moen  tub/shower turn knob also does not present with any resistance as my master bathroom does.  In fact it the guest bathroom turns with ease after neighbor installed the first new Moen 1222 Cartridge replacement.   I also bought a new Moen tub/shower turn knob as the Lowe's associate said it must be stripped.  However, I took all pieces with me to the store and the piece did not look stripped to me.  I would greatly appreciate your professional advice/suggestions as I am spending many hours on this project; however, I feel it's probably something minor I am overlooking.  In appreciation!! Thank you!
Great advice, saved me a lot of headache, thanks
The easiest way to repair moen valves is to replace them with a different brand
Thanks.
Thank you So Much Its Really helped
No sound?
So much value in the first 1:30 alone!
I did the same thing. I had only hot water. When I rotate the cartridge 180 I get only cold water. Any idea?
No wet knees!!! 🙅🏾‍♀️
Is the best video. Shows the reality like how to treat the valve a little bit stuck. Thanks !! I love how you do this job with your nice shirt and you don’t even break a sweat. 😃. I followed all of the steps and changed mine. My installation wasn’t exactly the same but this helped me a lot!!!
That screw on the middle breaks, what’s the other way to do it
Yeah. Cold to hot is the way it would work if the plumbers had put the water heater in the middle of the house . . . as they should have.
Thanks Ramon. Cost me only $41. 12:00 really help me to turn stem to 180 Deg.
I am trying to change my cartridge but it's recessed behind the shower panel...how do I get to the pin. Can I email you a picture?
Thank you so much for this video. My handle wouldn't shut off the water. Had to turn off the water to the whole house on a Saturday hours before guest arrived for my daughters b-day. Followed these steps plus 2 trips to home depot and FIXED it myself with your help. THANK YOU! 👍👍
No.one hear anything u say
someone slammed the valve off by hitting it now it does not work what should i do
Thanks! Ours broke Saturday afternoon….was able to replace with your help!
Moen is a piece of garbage. The directions are totally in adequate. The sketches are sketchy and that's being kind. I'd be glad to show a picture. Their install instructions are not available online because there's such poor quality no one would buy them if they saw the instructions. Never buy a Moen.
Clear and well explained.  Thank You.
Thanks for this video. Too complicated for me so I’ll call a plumber.
Newbie question: How do you know which model replacement cartridge you need?
I have one that wasn't leaking, then it was swapped and now it does leak and hot water doesn't turn on, do you think it was put in wrong/upside down, or the limiters are the problem?
Thank you 🙏
I replaced everything but have a question.   I have the cold water on the right and hot water on the left and the shut off point is in the middle.   However, the water does not completely shut off at that point??  I rechecked the placement twice and that's the only way this valve goes back in.   I notice you said to rotate the valve 180 degrees to change it?   I'm flabbergasted on how to fix this darn thing.   Again, it only shuts off at the middle of hot and cold but leaks.   Have you heard about this issue before?
Moen....engineered by dumb dumbs
Thanks for the tips, this really helped me fix my broken valve.  I couldn't get my old valve out even with the puller.  I ended up trying to turn it with a pipe wrench to see if I could get it loose that way.  The plastic casing ended up coming apart--great quality product.  I was able to use needlenose pliers to pull out the rest of the valve bit by bit.  Luckily, I was able to get every bit of the old valve out of there and the pliers didn't cause any damage that I could see.  The new one went in no problem, now it's working perfectly.
Note to people who do not know.  Moen cartridges are under warranty.  You can get them replaced free of charge. Depending on your location I suppose in where to get it, but here in Toronto Canada, I just walked into Home Depot, talked to employee in plumbing section, got my free cartridge and walked out.  Just make sure you know which model number you need before going.  I suggest taking yours apart and checking before going to get it.
Very good video. Thank you very much.
How do I turn the water off
Great job on teaching SIR Thanks Thumbs up high!
Great video, keep up the good work!!
Can I do it you ask? After watching this video I'll gladly call a plumber!
Thank you so much.
I remembered a video I watched a year ago about what to do when the core pulls out of old cartridge using a 12mm tap and bolt to extract old body of cartridge a life saving tip!
Great video and guide. Thanks so much.
, m
I replaced it with a new one and i still don't have much water coming out
Greg Chick - Excellent video! My house guests will appreciate their hot showers. It seems like my DIY repairs on our 50-year old plumbing never go smoothly (everything is stuck, things break, etc.). Your video prepared me for those moments, highlighted all the most important details and...IT WORKED! I’m grateful for your excellent work. Thank you!
Thank you thank you!
good job teacher
Thank you for the content. Followed directions and replaced a 26 year old broken valve cartridge in under 30 minutes. The longest wait was for Moen to UPS the parts since they are warranted and are replaced at no cost to the original owner.
My valve clip is behind hot and cold Basel
I wanted to thank you so much  for such a good and easy to understand video on how to successfully remove this 1222 Moen cartridge, it was a success for me. Much appreciated.
may i ask whats best way for release to let water out of moen to turn off valve an release doesnt stay in up position ? what can i use clean this .so when water turns off  switch automaticall releases ?
what about the lubricant?
Why does the cartridge fail?  Design flaw?  Planned obsolescence?  Can they be fixed instead of replaced?
I called a plumber and he didn't have sheet.  He had to leave for an hour and get the parts. Cost me time and money. DIY is best .  My plumber never wears a collared white dress shirt.  Is that a 1225 or 1222 b cartridge? I
Shouldn't you lube the new valve before you install it?
I think there are TWO shut-off valves behind the round cover plate at 3 and 9 o'clock position or on the incoming water lines - turn 90 degrees, no need to find the main valve elsewhere.
Haha my wife and I loved this video, it damn near saved our marriage
Thanks bro ..
Would this possibly fix a leak in the wall that travels down a floor?
Thank you for this video. You made it easy to do this repair
amazing, its like sitting in a class and learning it from a professional.  Thank you.  My faucet handle is loose, I am going to try tightning that central screw and hope for the best.  If that doesn't workout I am using your video to change the whole assembly.  :)
Even in 2021this video is still relevant. I was able to change out my shower valve with minimal hiccups as this was my 1st time doing anything like this.Thanks for the detailed steps and thorough tips.
Great job! fantastic talented instructor.  Would you ever put a bit of  "marine grease" on the valve so its not so hard to get off next time?
Why on a moen water valve make high pitch sound when in off position in shower
Very good and well presented  video without a bunch of extraneous useless babble.  My plastic cartridge had seized and I bought the HD brass replacement. My experience was just like the video! Except for the old cartridge slides out after it breaks loose. My cartridge broke loose ( with the puller tool) and then  came out a full inch! Then while rocking and pulling to get it out it snapped. The metal in the plastic cartridge ends at the end of the stem. The rest is plastic with thin metal sleeves.  I installed the new brass cartridge easy peasey.    If you have to replace the cartridge, spend a couple extra bucks and get the HD. You won't regret it. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00556LB6G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  Again, well done. Thank you.
Oldie but goodie. Great information! Thank you
How can you identify which mix valve type is it or are they all generic?
Where did you buy that puller?
Thanks
Thank you!
Man, thank you so much! Very informative and it helped me get the job done! I appreciate this video!
Found this video after I figured out how to remove the stripped hex screw. Moen def needs to change those! I also used needle nose pliers to loosen the cartridge prior to pulling it out. This video got me the rest of the way through.
Good job. I learned something new.
What happens if you don’t put that clip back on?
Thank you so much!
@ramonasplumber is there a way to find out what model cartridge you need before taking out the old cartridge? I've seen 1222 and 1122B cartridges
How would you know what model cartridge you need before taking out the cartridge? Or do you need to  remove the old cartridge in order to know?
Thanks a ton. Very concise.
Thank you!  This showed me conceptually how to do it!  Of course, mine was completely broken and stuck but this helped me to get it done.
“How to best repair a Moen faucet: Hack it out with a sawsall and replace with it with a better brand.”
Great video      Saved me from calling a plumber. THANKS
Awesome video... So I guess the Moen only has one style of this type of valve...mine is little leak and has a Humm while water is flowing ..
👍👍
A very clear and informative video. Well done ramonasplumber! "Yes, You Can" sounds like Obama is on his campaign trail again. I guess not too many plumbers will like you as their friends! Thanks once again.
I can remove the hex screw from my shower handle, but the handle is stuck. What should I do to remove the handle? Please advice. Thank you!
I did all of this, and cold to blend to hot works. But I have a small drip. what would cause that?
With water to my home on, my shower is the only place we no longer have flow. There are no leaks in the wall. What could our problem be? Our valve cartridge looks exactly like this one in the video. I am leery to pull out the cartridge though.
I just found your video today. It is very easy to watch and understand. Thank you for making videos for DIY moms like myself. I am saving hundreds doing these simple repairs by myself.
Our shower valve was stuck and we didn't have the tool, but by accident found a way to get it out without any effort. We had taken off the shower head and put an end cap on it since it was leaking some water and turned the main water valve back on to do laundry. In just a few minutes the stuck shower valve was pushed out by the water pressure (the retaining clip was removed). Just have some one ready to turn off the water supply when it comes out.
This was so very helpful!! I got to the part to pull it out and got stuck and frustrated! This helped me keep from pulling hair.
I have a leak at the handle area that leaks at the back of the faucet when its on. it looks like the leak is dripping and working it's way back behind the wall. Is the cartridge the culprit and needs to be replaced?
I figured out most of it on my own but referred to YouTube to make sure. Figured it out for my 84 year old mother’s shower temperature that the handyman couldn’t figure out!
His prices for the supplies are what a plumber could charge you if you bought the tools off them. The tools are about 1/4 of the cost of what he's saying they are and the supplies. The puller was $10 and the cartridge was $19 not a difficult job. Definitely do not call him if his tools cost him that much he will overcharge you.
This is the best video, very well explained
How many days will I be willing to go without a shower?
I have one like this . Is there any lube to use on the pull handle inside ?it’s a little tight pulling it on
Nice video, BUT these parts are NOT that expensive, The puller on ebay is only $10 or $19 for the best one. The cartridge is FREE from Moen. - So basically under $20 and a little time - You can do this.
Thanks for talking about the tools and parts, too.
Of all the DIY repair video dudes we’ve used over the years, you are one of the best.  Thanks for your help.  Don’t know what we’d do without people like you who are willing to take the time to share your knowledges and experience to make our lives easier.  From Cindy and Dave in Terrace, BC, Canada.... THANKS 😘💕
Thanks, this will be very helpful when I fix  mine.
So it seems like I need a new cartridge since mine just spins and spins or maybe a cartridge and a new handle.
Excellent explanation.  My son and I were trying to fix his shower valve but didn't know what to do.  This explains everything.  I hope that one of the big box stores has the correct replacement.  Kind regards, Al
Love this.  So clear!  Thanks Ramon!  You are so clear and detailed.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Bless you.
Thanks for sharing your wisdom sir!! DOES ANYONE knw if a bad Cartridge  can cause water pressure problems?? Water coming out from shower head while I’m filling up tub!!! HELP😬😬
How do tell you moen is a specific brand, model, part number? Is there a specific website to order these oem parts? Thank you
Baby one of the best DIY videos I have ever seen. Detail and no watching unnecessary information. Thank you
Talk and doing at the same time better.
You forgot to greese the new cartridge....oops!
Very helpful. Got my core for $46. Thank you.
you may be an ass....
Hold on hold on. My handle won’t come off even with the screw already out. What do I do? 😳
Thanks for the help - worked perfectly.  I was afraid I would have to go through the wall to replace the entire valve, this was a great help.
This guy sounds like a dick in his intro
I can do it thank you for sharing your knowledge
Very helpful
I'm watching this because the kids bedroom shower broke and the water can't be turned off-- had to shut the main cold & hot off -- because the builders "Atlantic Builders" from Fredericksburg, VA did not install shut offs for the tub - killing my entie water supply to my house is the only way. Cheap bastards! ...I already have a plumber on he way to deal with it.  I've already replaced 2 Moen sick filters in my bathroom -- and the tub today was filling up with a full stream of water forcing me into this... I'm watching this video as the plumber shows up! .... Still good though -- since MY shower could do the same thing!  Thanks for posting!
This was very informative and just what I needed to fix a dripping one I had installed five years ago.
He’s looks like doctor performing a surgery lol with white shirt an sterilization room an tools lol good job
what is the size of allenwrench? thanks
Thank you very much!!!
best video to replace cartridge i have seen thanks I had to replace three ..you saved and helped me tremendous time and $$ thank you greatly !!! for helping the little guy    me..:)
Very well done.  Excellent How-To video.  Many thanks!
Hi,Please refer to our site for repairs of shower http://www.Van-jacuzii-cabindosh.com
LOL at 8:25.
Don't forget to put a towel down over the drain, or you can spend another 1/2 hour trying to retrieve a screw. And what is the deal with that tub surround
Thank you this was very helpful
Thanks you save me  375$ 😄
Single mom of two .. needed to figure this out with the help of this video I was successful!!   Thanks so much 🙏
Very nice. Thank You Sir. -- I have the EUROMIX SuperGrif model. -- My tub drips and my shower in a different bathroom just dribbles very lightly. -- Both have the same type cartridge/valve.
Thanks to Ramonasplumber for this helpful video.....saved the day today....although the cartridge did not come out easy...took a lot of force and pulling to break it and get it out....but that's not the video's fault.  Great stuff, well done video.
https://www.ebay.com/itm/303789683964
great job
We used this video as a step by step. Cartridge cost $48 and the remover thingy cost about $15. Took about 2 hours/ most of the time it took because we had trouble getting the pin in and out. For $65 easy repair.
Tho
Still valuable information 10 years later....  thanks so very much!
In my experience, the best way to replace a Moen part is to fully replace it with ANY OTHER FIXTURE. My Brother is a Moen sales representative, and he gifted me kitchen sink, 2 bathroom sink, and a tub/shower fixture. These replaced the Delta fixtures and the American Standard fixture that have been in place for at least 14 years. They were all working perfectly. I appeased my wife, installed the fixtures, and have replaced the cartridges  in all of the fixtures after only 4 months of use.  I have since removed the tub/shower diverter, and 1 of the 2 bathroom sink faucets. The other 2 units will be replaced in the very near future .
No, wrong.  This is a cartridge replacement,  not valve replacement.  Duh.
The doctor plumber
Spoken like a true plumber. Cartridge puller is $15 on Amazon not $50 to $100. Moen 1225 cartridge is $19 on Amazon not $100.
thanks for the video you save me a lot of money. I WAS ABOUT TO CALL A PLUMBER,  THE GUY WHO REMODELED THE BATHROOM INSTALL THE HANDLE WRONG .WATCHING THE VIDEO UI REALIZED THE OFF POSITION WAS AT THE 6 O'CLOCK, OUR WAS AT THE 12 O'CLOCK. GREAT VIDEO.THANKS FROM CHICAGO.
I’m going to try this out, Thank you so much!
My intent is to be clear and effective, as if by succeeding it is like succeeding doing a service call.  If I do my task, I get paid and I sleep nights.  I am such an idealist, sorry but I do care and am very glad to help, we both won!
Awesome video, I just saved myself at least 2 to five hundred dollars on calling a plummer. Thanks for the video.

Very clear, thank you.
This was a huge help. No plumber needed. A+
Good video was able to fix it myself. 👌👍👍
Thanks great video! Made it pretty easy, thanks again.....
Thank you for helping me through this.
8:42 w.a.p.
extremely helpful. The puller is the key. I have been trying to replace my moen cartridge a few times...... I have not been able to pull it out with the plastic gadget....
8:39 was pretty hot...
What the name of that part to take out the thing
By replacing it with a DELTA
Good info. How do you know what cartridge I have, before starting the work? Thanks.
Hi,Please refer to our site for repairs of shower http://www.monicashopping.com
Excellent video. Thank you! A+
Great Video!
many videos never go over the (hot and cold) adjustments and how you need to put things back a certain way overwise the rotation and temperature don't match, the first time I did this following another video everything was backwards and I was pretty confused myself, figured it out on my own, but its not necessarily clear that moving that center stem around will  change so much.
Thanks I wondered about that clip................Cheers, Jim
Thank you for your knowledge and time putting this together. It helped me a lot!!
Can the cartridge rotate with the clip in? I put a new handle on ours because the old one cracked inside and I think I may have moved the cartridge when I turned it hard to the left...because it has always operated in a counter clockwise direction. Now the water only comes on by turning it to the right and it gets hot right way and then colder as you turn it. It only shuts off when you turn it back counter clockwise. Do you think I can move that cartridge back into position by turning it?
So I just successfully replaced the cartridge,  and my problem persists... Rotating to hot drops the pressure by 50%. I can't take a high pressure, hot shower
Hi,Please refer to our site for repairs of shower http://www.Van-jacuzii-cabindosh.com
Thanks for the video, I did on my own.
Well done instructor plumber
What kind of the screwdriver that I can use to take the handle off
Thanks, was able to replace the cartridge with ease after watching this! Thanks. The new cartridge makes a lot of noise.. did i do something wrong??  No issue with hot cold water flow. Just a noise like a motor is running.. any way to fix this?
Unbelievable the sound only is on the left track!
I couldn’t watch long, only got through the first minute. I just bought a puller for 15 bucks, and the valve is like 25. This stuff doesn’t cost hundreds of dollars.
Glad this helped everyone else, as for me, not so lucky as I will have to rip out the entire tile and backer-board and replace the whole fixture and either go broke or learn how to solder copper. Why? I damaged the soft brass fixture because the cartridge broke apart while trying to pull it out.   Before breaking it apart I tried first drilling and  tapping trying to be careful.  But in the end, no such luck because the plastic had to be broken apart piece by piece.  After that I surveyed the damage and sure and enough that brass is soft and it gouged in multiple areas leaving a leak path.  Unfortunately, now I have a permanent drip which warrants demolishing the entire shower wall.  Hope others have better luck but this is 2020.   This was only 6 years old Moen.  Bummer.
Extremely helpful. Saved me at least $200. Nice and easy
Of course, it looks like my pipe is slightly too short coming out of the wall, so pulling the pin out of the stem isn't working out so well. The pin needs to come straight up, but the curvature of the chrome Moen backplate is preventing me from getting it even half way up. Ughhhhh!
It took me a hell of a lot longer but I got it done the same night the problem occurred so I’m forever grateful.
Hello, great video. how do I know what cartridgeI need?
Thank you for the plumbing knowledge.  The video repair is easy and clear to understand.  Thank you.
Thank you
Thank you for your great instructions!  I fixed it myself. So proud.😀
Thank you very much. Great video. I have several of these valves in my building..  Hired a "plumber" to repair one about a month ago.  Total disaster, water went from off to hot to off to cold.  I called the owner of the plumbing company and promptly was able to send a competent plumber.  This time I did it myself in less than an hour and it works perfectly.  I did need the puller and was prepared for that.
Thanks for sharing your expertise.  I did it and it saved me the cost of a plumber.
Very helpful video, I had to replace mine and I follow of the steps that you provided in the video and I’m all set good and successfully replaced it without damaging or broke it. Thank you 🙏
Thank You
Whats the name of the tool you used to pulled out the valve? Can I buy it in Home Depot? Is it one size?
Yea but on my Ramona's plumber .com site home page, i'm in sandals..
My shower in one part of the house didnt have hot water/very little pressure. This video helped me troubleshoot my shower valve. Turns out there was a huge mineral deposit clogging the hot water outlet for this one shower. Cleared it and now its flowing great. Thanks for the video!
What if my handle doesn’t want to come off
Thankyou ,you make it easy to understand and very good at recording exactly what to do!!!
This helped me tremendously!
I know this video is from a long time ago so I’m not sure if anyone will see this but I’ve recently had an issue with the shower handle making noise, mine is just like the one in this video, when I turn it on it makes this high pitched whinning or whistling type sound (that’s the best I know how to describe it) so I don’t see anything leaking from the handle part but if anyone can tell me what is wrong with it and what I can do to fix it I’d greatly appreciate it. Thanks and God Bless
This video was very helpful but where can I buy the Posi puller
Thank you so much for this video! I'm a total hack and was able to do this with no complications!!
I appreciate how thorough you presented this.
Thank you for this video. I watched your video for 30 mins and got the cartridge and did it in less than 20mins. 👍🏿
Outsanding vidio when I went to Lowes I purchased the $14.00 puller with the cartridge. Definitely needed the puller. Thanks made it only a 15 minute job after watching your vidio.
Puller cost like 20 bucks
Helped. Thank you
Maybe he just needed a Mulligan
Thanks for taking the time to make this video. That said, I think you may be scaring do-it-yourselfers a bit too much when you mention that the puller tool costs about $100.  In fact, you can buy the Moen tool (not aftermarket) for anywhere from about $15 to $25 if needed.
Great Video!!!!
Wow you are a life saver. I can not thank you enough for this video. You saved me so much money. I was able to get a puller from Lowe’s for $15 and a new cartridge for $50. I’m so thankful for this video and your great instructions!
8:40 Good teaching.
Can you do a video with a shower panel installation to an existing shower? I have this same moen shower but the panel has the hot and cold separate and mt current shower has the hot and cold together. Any advice on how to separate it?
Excellent presentation. And thank you for keeping the music brief.
Thank you sir I appreciate your video I can do it I just need to buy the parts thank you so much
Too much he may have??? Yack yack yack!!👎👎👎👎👎
Thank you for the information very helpful 👍
cannot get the retainer clip back on
followed your instruction i saved myself $160 thanks a lot !
Thanks.  Very helpful.  Thankfully did not have to use the big extractor to get the old cartridge.  I did have to take the main cover off to get at the clip but this is 2020 and I guess the design has changed.
First off I think there should be a separate like button linked to a persons account that when pressed automatically sends a case of beer to you. I went to my in-laws A couple days ago thinking I was going to fix a leaking sink faucet, bit of a communication mixup, but found it was this instead. Never done one before and this video was a huge help. Living in Canada I expected to pay more for the puller and OEM cartridge but got both for $120 Canadian. The puller is quite different than yours but worked as advertised. Went back today and was done in 15 minutes. My mother-in-law was puzzled and obviously didn’t think I was done. Her English isn’t very good so it took awhile to find out that her son had fixed the same thing in the upstairs bathroom but he had taken part of the tile off and replaced the whole thing. I asked my wife later if he even knew about the cartridge but turns out he didn’t. Hopefully he’ll take the time in the future to check things out before making costly, needless repairs.   I should add that watched a couple other videos were the cartridge was much more difficult to pull out and solutions for those issues so that helped a lot to give me confidence to try it instead of calling a plumber.
8:41 thru 8:53 I did this last night😉
Wooow you really saved my life,with all this pandemic situation it’s hard to expend a  big amount of money on things you can actually do by yourself,I found your video last night and I removed the cartridge following your instructions and today I went to buy a new one,now it’s done I’m ready for a shower and go to work.so happy I did it by myself,my wallet thanks you Mr. good job,good video,well explained. I’m texting you from Montreal Ca. Have a great day!!
You don’t need a special puller  tool to pull the cartridge out, you can rock it back and forth with needle nose pliers but still a great video 👍👍
Man I wish i didnt fast forward your video... i might have figured out how to shut off the water would have been VERY helpful 1ST... I accidently broke the rusty pipe behind the wall cuz i cranked it too hard. I then went into crisis mode scrambling to find how to turn it off... after tripping over and breaking some of the kids furniture and toys I made a few phone calls some deductive reasoning I found out that the water shuts off Outside of the house so full blast water and near 30 minutes later a lot of drywall ruined and my basement totally  flooded I got the water shut off... Yay.    I would like to give a special thanks to the jerkstore who decided that you need a special tool to properly remove the thing it cost me a small fortune to have everything repaired. I regret to admit that I also am seeing a shrink to process the traumatic experience since it has left me broke, I got fired from my job for spacing out and not making quota. The same day I walked into my house to finding my wife cheating on me with the contractor we hired to fix the whole job..  what has made it Really hard is reliving the moment where my wife called me a little bitch because I just stood there while the guy cleaned her pipes. ..  . I dont know I just couldnt help it he didnt even slow down he actually sped up and the irony or everything sinking in just made me freeze up.    So a few months later everything now different in my life i now sleep in the basement because my wife and Rob the contractor cant handle the black mold thats brewing behind the walls down here. Im not sure if you can learn something from my story if you do then i feel better because I dont try to do anything on my own anymore. My psych Doctor is working with me slowly baby stepping me back to normal... I guess the good news is Im pretty sure things couldnt get much worse but hey somebody has to make people laugh hopefully I did that okay...  Alright guys good luck with fixing your leaky showers... btw Luck is Not A Factor.
This helped immensely.  Home depot had both the valve and the puller tool.  It takes about 30 minutes to complete this job.  Hardest part for me was step 1 - removing the handle.  The little grub screw was tight due to corrosion.  WD40 to the rescue!
Thank you!
I'd like to start out by saying I'm glad your video was the first suggestion for my search. I watched your video and it saved me god knows how much money hiring a plumber as it wasn't something I'm familiar with whatsoever. All of a sudden my bathroom turned into a sauna from all the hot water flowing through the damaged cartridge. I watched your video, ran to the plumbing supply store and purchased my cartridge, didn't work at first as it still flowed through just like my old one did. I stopped watched your video again and went back to it and was successful! Thank you sir!
Thanks!  You saved me $345.  That's what the plumber I called quoted me to change the cartridge.  I was lucky I had a new one from Moen when I called last time to have them give me a new one for the kitchen sink faucet.  They sent me one for the shower, too.
The cartridge removal tool doesnt cost $100, It cost less than $15 ay home depot
Thanks for the video! I was able to take care of the repair myself!
Thank you, I just fix it.
Gracias por el entendimiento y ya pude remplazar el mío. Pude ajustar mi temperatura del agua, ya que los los desperdician el agua caliente.
Ty much
thank you worked perfect
I cant unscrew the faucet because it's completely because it just keeps turning Stripped screw Any tips
i have showers that or back to back when one shower is in use there a leak in the other shower  where  would the fix on this leak?
Great tutorial, but these Moen cartridges are POS.  When car parts last longer than plumbing parts...
What size allen wrench? I tried metric and us but both sets were either too big or too small.
!!!Iwant to see you in old catridge cua,cua ,cua🤔,cuaaasaasaa👎👎👎!!!😂😂😂😂
Great directions.  The one hiccup that came up was that after I removed the handle and screw, instead of the plastic white and black handle adapter, mine was metal and it didn't want to come off.   I was trying to pull it off and it wouldn't budge.   I then tried WD40 and the back end of a screwdriver and tapped in in different directions.  Then it finally came off. Thanks for the video.
I watched this once, knew what I needed, bought the new cartridge and the puller to have just in case. I ended up needing it. It took me 5-10 minutes in total to complete. Had I not watched, it would have taken me longer to make this repair. My house is 120 years old so any time I can do repairs myself I am thankful!
Thank you so much for doing such a great tutorial!!!
The only thing I don't agree with is not using lubricant on the valve internals. The cartridge probably has some but putting some inside is always a good move.  Overkill, probably, but I think in the long run it will enable the new cartridge last longer.   I have re-lubricated my old cartridge twice and it is still going long after it should have failed.  You MUST use lubricant suitable for potable water systems or you risk contaminating your water system.
Take me hooooooome.... Country roooooooooads
Remember to cover the drain when working on the showerbody
The gentleman is not an average homeowner, it is obvious that he is very knowledgeable of plumbing, maybe a master plumber. This is not a job for an average homeowner, call a plumber for a repair like this. Kudos to the old man !!
Am I the only one thats having trouble taking the cartridge out with the puller... It just does not want to come out.
The puller tool is NOT $100 lol... Nonsense
Great video . I have no experience with plumbing Watched video and was actually able to replace cartridge and fix shower myself. Not going to say I didn't have a few mishaps but the video was invaluable. Thanks
If my handle seemed to be sliding changing the off location would this fix help?  I noticed my faucet was leaking so went to turn it on then off again and felt the whole handle mechanism slide which seemed to move the whole alignment of the handle. Now when I want to shut off the faucet it needs to face right instead of straight down.
faucet dripped so I watched your video on removing it.. after checking it for debris I put it back in.  Now the handle was facing up when off.. Your video helped iron out my WTF moment.  Thanks..    still dripped so I'm picking up a new one.
Greg, what would be the cause of a 1222b brand new replacement giving me low pressure on a tub?  The install went fine but pressure is way lower than w the old cartridge. A ny thoughts?
Nice. Thanks!
1222
Great video Sir!
good video
Anyone know the model number of the Moen shower valve or cartridge used in the video?
Thank you for this video!  I really help especially the part showing how to effectively use the tool.
Thanks for the great video, super helpful and it saved my landlord a butt load of money.👍 Thanks to Moen for making it easy to identify which cartridge I needed.
Thanks I did it perfectly with your video
Thanks......We can do it
Very good video! I followed every step of the way. It was a little bit hard to come out but it finally came out. It took me a little while because I didn’t tighten the cartridge puller all the way. I went back and look at the video and tighten the puller and it started coming out. Excellent video, and thank you for the step by step process.
Good job 👍
100 bucks for the extractor??? I just paid 13 for it.
This video guide was a tremendous help in providing the understanding needed to perform this repair. I used my new found knowledge to repair shower valves in two of our bathrooms. Much appreciated!!!
Thank you saved money by doing it myself!!
how do I tell which cartridge is in my shower? I don't have an owners manual and don't have access to that information,,,it does look like the one in the video though so if you could tell me which one that is would be helpful...thanks for the video,, once I find out which one I have, after seeing this I can do this myself...signed a single older lady who has to be handy... :) thanks again
I did this but now the water pressure is too strong. How do you reduce the water pressure?
Are they all the same size
You were right. I could do it!  (I did need the puller but they have gone WAY down in price since you bought your $100 one. $14.50 now 👍😁)
Thank you so much! I followed your video and it was a cinch to fix! After a quick stop at Lowe's, $50 for both the shower handle and the cartridge, and 15 or so minutes labor, and PRESTO! Done deal!  Much appreciated my friend!!!
Explain how change 2 peiece handle for replac seal
Thank you for this video I was having trouble with hot and cold so after learning that I dont need the limiter I took it off now I have a good mix of water mahalo sir from Hawaii.
Is a thermal mixer still better than installing a manual version? https://youtu.be/b2y3mTDhI3c
Nice job,thanks sir
Great video, thank you.
He looks like a doctor.
Thank you, we saved $250!
Thanks
This video was saviour for us today. I was able to follow the instructions and fully replace the cartridge myself. The most difficult part for me was to put the clip back. It didn't had much space to put it in so easily as shown in this video. Took me over an hour to execute these instructions, but overall it was successful project. Thank you Sir.
Thank you!  This is was so helpful and saved me tons on a plumber.  Took a little longer then expected but got it done.
Why the hell does the plumber have to be a man as you keep refering to the plumber as "he".  Jackass.
How Do you know which cartridge you need
Thank you:: People like you are truly angels looking out for people like this::
Thank you very much for posting this video, i couldn't pull out my stubborn cartridge and planning to call plumber but after watching this I did it myself and in the end  tip of turning knob about 180 degree was useful too. One question does it help to use WD 40 or CLR on the stuck cartridge. Thanks again.
Is there only 1 size for all? Sorry i dont know nothing about this.
First you say...smoking is injurious to health... and then you said still you can smoke...   🤔.., hope you get what i m trying to say  Anyway.... thanks for later part of your video
What size Allen key did you use to remove the handle?
Great video. Spent 50 bucks for the cartridge,  20 bucks for the puller. Fought like hell to get the old one out but got it done. Another 30 minutes to put it back together cause I put the handle backwards....lol. Saved money on a plumber. Thanks for the tips.
Get a decent pair of channel locks
Good info, but please quit talking so so much!  This video could’ve been cut in half.
Great video. I feel very relieved that I might be able to do this job myself.
First off, Thank you! I am the least handy man in the WORLD! However I manage to replace the cartridge and Stop the leak by following step by step... Thank you very much again!
Thank you so much. Ive been telling my Landlords that ive been having problems with my shower valve since 2014 and the damn thing finally gave out today 2/23/2020 and my Landlords only like to be reached by email so here we are 6 hours later with Zero replies. I searched on google how to replace the shower valve and your video popped up. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge. Because of your How To video, i was able to replace the cartridge my self and it was the  MOEN part# 1222 that was needed. Part was only about $50.00s plus $15.00 for the removal tool which i bought. I repaired it and now my kids can take a shower. Thank you very much, i am very grateful!
This was so helpful it worked exactly like he says. I will watch more of his videos since I'm doing my fixer-upper.
Thanks for you help
Great video. I was able to do it without puller by twisting the old cartridge 45 degrees back and forth while pulling out. I was very generous with the lubricant with the new cartridge.
Thaaaaaank you!!!!!
Worked for me.. thanks !!
great video. thank you fine sir
This is fantastic. Thank you very much for sharing this.
Great video. Instructions were easy to follow and the language was easy to understand. I've never seen a plumber wearing white. He could easily be a doctor of plumbing?
Nice! U da best 👍🏼
Very well done!!! How the heck could anyone thumb down this video. It was flawlessly and to the point
So I’m assuming I’m not the only one .
do you turn the water off at the street ??
my left ear loved this tutorial
8:00 She must've liked that, ya made her squirt, bud!
How did u guys watch this video with no sounds
Thanks a lot. I need to replace one of my Moens. I think I can do it.
STEP 1: TURN YOUR WATER MAIN OFF!!!! This guy’s video is fantastic- first rate. BUT it is easy to skip over the talking portion at the beginning of his video. I did this and failed to understand how serious a mista it would be to pull your valve/cartridge out without first turning your home’s water completely off. The situation quickly turned into a nightmare when my spouse and I realized we’d never discovered where our water main is! Even in our inspection report from a year ago, there was no determination of its location. I had to call the emergency line of my utility company to get guidance and turn off the water main. Finally, with the water off, I was able to replace the valve and then test the water. All good now thanks to this vid 👍🏼
What do you do when the Allen screw is stripped?
This video was so helpful! If anyone is looking for the right answers, it’s in this video right here! 🙌🏼
Allen wrench size?
All I can say is thank you, thank you for your video. I just did my walk in shower and it fixed the problem. You are a great teacher and you save me a lots of money. God bless you.
this man has his shit together!
8:35 😁😌👏👏 Good job !!  That's called experience !!
Great advice and amazing quality of work with the video and with the pipes. I saved $310+ today. The cartridge is free at Home Depot and it takes a few minutes to get the job done. I will sure look for your advice for my next project!
Thank you for show us how to do. I will contact Moen service part department to get free parts
Good video but he didn't put plumbers putty on the new cartridge, very important.
I learned a lot from you. Thank you so much. God bless us always.
No pants were worn in the making of this video.
Thanks
we cant ear you
Thanks for all your knowledge 👍
Thank you now have a shower again.
*I've installed 90-degree faucets and shower trim in two bathrooms in two separate houses now. In addition to this collection striking a great balance of style, solid construction==>**allmy.tips/MoenTshower?rR< **   and surprisingly low prices; Moen customer service is top notch and then some. 800 number staff is really knowledgeable. I was replacing an older Moen trim kit so able to use the existing valve in the shower wall. Note this is available in two valve trims, depending on your wall valve. Amazon clearly marks one as Moentrol and the other as Positemp, so don't make the same mistake I did and overlook that!*
Thank you for your video! It saved my fiance and I ~$500 from the quote we were given earlier today. I spent $64 for the moen puller and the replacement cartridge.
Good job! Now I'm ready to tackle it!
that was perfect thanks saved me a bunch of money and brain damage! thanks!!
Thank you for a very clear video.  My shower is working great now
Helarios my valve also broke in Christmas break lol thanks to this video it didnt turn into a problem thank you it was a quick fix.
Back in the day I worked at an apartment complex that had 200 apartments thus 200 tub/showers which was equipped with Moen magnum cartridges. I worked there 21 years and wish I had a dollar for every cartridge I replaced (without a puller! Not sure if was available back in 1970). Excellent video!
Im watching this because my shower valve had to break today, on Christmas day 😤🤣😎😎🤙🔥🔥🔥
Only thing I would have done different is using plumbers grease!
Whats up with the audio??? I thought it was my phone,could  not hear nada.
Wouldn’t be better if you use the white grease that comes with the cartridge before install . ? Great video
Purchased the Moen Core Puller at Home Depot for $14.00. I could not have removed the cartridge without it. it took two of us one on each side of the valve. The old one was in place for about 25 years. It was very difficult to remove but with out this tool it would have been impossible to remove the old cartridge. Thank you so much for this video it was very helpful.
For certain Moen products prior to 2010, there is no Allen key removal. You need to use a small pry tool to remove the small cap to remove the screw.
Ive done this and no water still came out the shower... i did this step exact... even made sure water was coming from the two slots inside the valve... what is happening?
Excellent video, thank you so much sir 👍👍👍. I will also add that before taking any of the screws out, be sure to close/plug your drain so you don’t accidentally loose your screws down the drain in case they drop/fall.
Fact check.. the tool he says is “in the neighborhood of $100” is $15 at Home Depot.  The cartridge he says is $75 to $100 is under $50 at Home Depot.  Both could be found cheaper elsewhere.  This took 5 minutes and with the tool is was very easy.  Forget all his warnings and watch another less threatening video.  Aside from the needless warnings that may lead you to hire a plumber, everything else is good.
When my Moen shower quit, I turned on the water until I got to the reduced flow, let it run for a few minutes, went a little more, let it run, finally  all the way and let it run,  This warmed up the old cartridge enough so that it started flowing like new after I shut it on and off a few times.
Moen; buy it for looks, repair it, repeat...
A DIY vid can't get any better than this. Best dressed instructor too.
Not clear what caused the leak, was anything replaced??
Thanks! I made it until 1 min mark before I determined to go ahead and hire a plumber.
Where do you purchase your supplies. You quote 100.00 for a oem cartridge wrong 30.00 you guote 100.00 for cartridge puller wrong 40.00. Who are you?
Professional this beep
I have a fiberglass tub/shower/full, and can get to the back of the valve . . . How do you keep the escutcheon plate from sliding left and right within the diameter of the hole?
your video was really helpful, I fix a lot of my problems around the home. this video showed just what I wanted to know. Thank you.
My shower valve is hard to turn   How do I find out what brand it is?  There is no manual and no brand stamp on the chrome plate. And it’s only 3 years old.
Thanks Mr. Clean!
I got all the way to the point where the insides were not coming out and I did NOT want to start breaking shit, so this video was an incredible help! Thanks for posting this.
Its too long talking 😂😂😂😂its better to cal plumber
Here is my advice: IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE PULLER, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR !
Most people don't realize that if you call the makers of all the different faucets, they will send you free replacement parts. Don't buy the parts!
thanks
This video provided all the relevant information needed to replace a Moen shower cartridge.  The only thing I didn't recall being mentioned is using the capsule of silicone jell provided to make insertion of the new cartridge easier.  The old cartridge definitely didn't want to come out, so I did buy a cartridge puller for <$15 at Ace, as well as a replacement cartridge for $40.  So $55 vs hundreds of dollars for a plumber to do it.
I got my cartridge puller at Ace for less than $15.  It pulled it right out just as easily as the $100 one would have.
Great video. Extremely useful. Thanks
Great that looks easy , I will fix mine now thank you
I watched a bunch of videos and this ended up being the one I needed to fix my faucet. My cartridge was so stuck I’m glad I spent a little extra for the puller!
Excellent video! Appreciate you covering various scenarios, very thorough, articulate and helpful. Thank you very much!
I cannot get that screw out before the cartridge ..starting to strip  a bit..any suggestions on what I could do?
Thank you for your time!! Save me a lot of money
my replacement cartridge, from Moen, included a packet of silicon grease to be applied to the cartridge before installing it.   Makes a world of difference.
Thank you, great video.  Followed it step by step and saved myself from having to call a plumber.
Well I guess I have to call the plumber. My son broke that valve right off . Omg
He can and she can too......
thank you a whole lot sir, you just saved me a bunch of $ and being waterless until Monday. Of course one of our showers faucet broke at 4pm on a Saturday....imagine that ....
Thank you, just changed mine out with much success, I was shocked to discover a new cartridge cost $50!!!
This Video is VERY VERY Helpful.....I fixed my leak in my shower....by Just following his Clear  speaking step how to  change the Cartridge.....Thank you Sir
I can fix and if I can't fix I will fix it so that nobody can fix it.
Thanks dude. Saved my butt
You, sir, have made my day! I was able to successfully replace the valve in my shower/tub. Once I got the old one out, it was a cakewalk! Thank you so much for your informative video! Much, much appreciated!
What would happen if you fail to put the little clip back after installing new cartridge?
This video rocks!!!!  Great job, saved me the hassle of my warranty company contacting a plumber.  Was able to hit Lowes for the part right before they closed, less than an hour later, all changed and working again.
Thanks you so much. With the run to Menards it took me less than an hour till my shower was working again!!!!
So what if that metal sleeve doesn’t slide right off? We took off the faceplate to figure out why the metal tube sleeve wouldn’t come off and there’s not a big hole in the tub liked you’d expect the hole has a plastic flat piece inside holding everything in the wall.
Thank you sir for this video I just changed my cartridge today which is from Moen with  a Moen factory puller and now I'm satisfied thanks once again
Awesome! $ saver = life saver!
Whoever installed my shower handle stripped the socket for the allen wrench. I've tried everything to unscrew the handle and no luck. Now I have to call a plumber to replace the cartridge.
It took me longer to watch the video than it did to change the core.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!
got no sound
Thanks for sharing. I wish I would've seen your video before calling the plumber. It would've saved me $289.
And where can i get that particular magnum cartridge puller?
Thank you sir you are a gem.   Single mom was able to do it and save a little cash (found puller and valve at home depot)
This video has much more detail than the Moen produced video. Thank you!!
I beg to differ on the escutcheon. Some valves have a water shut off screw on them so that you don't have to shut the water off.
Thank you so much for your video. I was able to change the cartridge myself.
Brilliant vid , perfect and thorough just what I needed to see , you are a star ⭐️
you talk too much dude.  seriously this video would have been more than less half the time.
just did replaced my cartridge this morning thanks for insight
And I did. Huge life saver. I was looking at a plumber doing it for $300+. Bought the replacement part at Lowe’s for $40. Did it all myself thank you for your help!
For those who used the method and ripped out only the inside of the cartridge only, don’t panic like I did!!! Get a chisel and a hammer and just chisel the hard plastic cartridge carefully into pieces to take out.  Here’s a YouTube video gave me the confidence to finish it https://youtu.be/2MP85xBftwI
I'd say that's some good cartridge work. She's squirting all over the place! (7:56) My wife and I are gonna try out your steel wool suggestion.
Awesome video! You saved me at least $200.00!   Although I have to admit,  putting that clip back in place was a pain in the ass lol.  Im just happy it works and I saved some money.  Thank you.
Greg, I replaced my cartridge today , yet the water flow is to light. What did I do wrong?
Thank you for putting out a great service for DIY folks. Your clear step-by-step instructions helped me replace my leaky cartridge in a short amount of time
Excellent video!!!!!!
Instructions are so easy to follow.  Works perfectly now, thanks for your help!
The question I have is how do I know which cartridge to buy and therefore the corresponding puller (posi-temp vs. non-posi-temp)?
Great video but my issue seems a little more difficult because I was turning on the shower and then the handle broke so how can I repair it?
Duh. Figured it out.
I replaced the stem exactly as shown, put the handle back on in the down position, turned on water and hot water came out. Turned handle to 12 o’clock and turned off. Turned handle a little more and cold water came out. ???
Used this video to the letter. Even bought the style of tool from home depot. Easier than I thought it would be.
video doesn't play. I just see 3 minutes of commercials.
Great video thank-you!
This saved me so much money, took me like maybe 45 minutes total as long as you have correct valve kit and puller.
Thanks for the help.  It worked like a charm.  Those cartridges are not cheap.
I want to learn how to stop a water leak in the faucet.  My super did not do a good job.  It only  stopped leaking for a few weeks.
Good to see that your DIY Instruction Video is still helpin' folks like me out nine years later since published.  Thanks for delivering the goods GC!!
Oh my goodness! Who designed this thing?!? 5 hrs later...by George, I think  we got  it!!! My head hurts. Gonna take a long hot shower to de-stress!
My shower handle doesn't have a screw and I can't get it off.
I did it, thanks!!
Excellent video! I found with the Moen 1222 that the rubber had split and was preventing the cartridge from coming out, even with the puller. After twisting and yanking hard, it was still stuck. Finally, I put a hair dryer on it for 10 minutes to expand the metal casing and it barely came out! I was told at the hardware store that that Moen cartridge was recalled and I got the replacement one for free.
I just did it. Thanks for your video
Great video, thanks. Just a note, for the allen wrench you need a 7/64 size allen wrench, which is not included in every set of allen wrenches (especially ones that come with inexpensive home toolboxes and similar setups.) I was able to get a puller - which I ended up needing - for about $15 at home depot when I was buying the Moen OEM valve.
I just watched this after I completed the repair myself... not that difficult to do on your own.  However, considering the thousands of likes for this video, Moen should be ashamed of designing and manufacturing a super common part installed by thousands of contractors, that fails with a year or two if installation.  Won’t be buying Moen again.
excellent video thank you
@9:28 what function does This clip serve?
so professional, even wearing white shirt on the job., many thanks.
Nice one
Should the new valve turn without the knob being on
It's best video. Thank you very much. You save us a big time.  But after I replace cartridge(due to handle is getting hard to rotate), restore everything, I turn on my shower, it doesn't have much water coming out .why? What do I do now?
*Didnt you have to use silicone grease on the new cartridge before putting it in?*
Thank you so much for the video! I just replaced my shower/tub valve.  The only problem I had was getting the cartridge out, the puller tool did not work (although I had a generic brand which you said would not work). However, the square plastic holder did help to loosen it. Only other challenge I had was getting that pin back in. After several attempts and some prayer it went into place. Praise God! After the water came back on I discovered the handle was on backwards, but that was a simple fix.
I have a question I noticed water dripping from the shower pipe coming out of the wall when I replaced my shower head after a few days I had the shower head off and it was leaking is this effected by a faulty shower knob because that is slightly leaking as well
Saved a lot of money with this video. Perfect tutorial, clear instructions, thank you very much!
What do we do if the inner stem broke from the cartridge? Is there any other way then???
Saved my butt for sure. Thank you!!!!
@ramonasplumber thanks for the video!  The plumber wanted $1000. I paid $22 for the cartridge and $16 for the puller, both at Home Depot.   I did this today and it was pretty quick & simple; 3 Philip screws, a puller, and two trips to Home Depot. First trip was for the puller, second was to take the old cartridge for comparison and get the correct replacement.
Thanks for detailed video. The stupid warranty company were running us up and down until we watched this video and we fixed it.
Too much BLAH BLAH BLAH. CHOP CHOP and get to the replacement
Good video.
I had difficulty getting a replacement Posi-Temp 1222 to fit all the way into the assembly (I was replacing an old 96909 cartridge). It would get stuck about 1/4" from being all the way in. As it turned out it just took more force to get it in. Use the white plastic key to wiggle the cartridge until it slips in.   This video helped clarify that the handle is supposed to face in the down position at 6 o'clock. It had previously been installed wrong (at the 12 O'clock position). Thank you for this video.
Had a plumber come by starts with R and to diagnose was $250.00 initial cost then labor and parts. I send them away and this video and others help me fix the ISSUE asap.
Thank you sir...I had the exact same Moen and all it cost me was a grand total $54.63  $46.49 for the cartridge and $3.98 for the waterproof silicone grease plus tax. I did pay $18.39 for a Posi Temp puller but I didn't need it I was able to use my pliers to pull out the cartridge so I'll take it back and get a refund but my tub faucet is working perfectly thanks to your tutorial. You are an excellent instructor. :)
Grease that shit homie
why was it replaced ?
THANK YOU   FANTASTIC
Hi, i already fix everything but the knob keeps falling it doesn't stay on the position i want. Note: it is already tighten but for some reason it keeps falling, what can i do?. Thanks in advance !!!
I did it! Saved me from paying a plumber to do it. Thanks so much for this excellent video.
Where do you turn off the water before starting to work on it? I can't find it anywhere in the bathroom or behind the shower.
moen is crap
This was super helpful today. Was able to follow the his directions and avert the charge for an emergency plumbers visit!
thanks man.
@8:40 damn mami
Woohoo! Hot water has returned to the tub! Thanks!
Woohoo! Hot water has returned to the tub! Thanks!
Omg thank you for this video we were dreading the worse watched this and it was a quick fix
Hmmmm....  I guess I would invest in a "puller" if I were to do several faucet valve repairs.  But since this is the first time in 30 years that I've needed my faucet valve repair, it would not be cost effective for me to invest in a "puller".  Looks like I need to call a plumber for this job.
Puller is like $20 max at any big box store. OEM products are available as well. This is easily done by the homeowner. Otherwise good video.
Thank you. I recently (2 days ago) changed two of my bathroom faucet cartridges... thanks to YouTube, the Internet and some helpful soul to created the video.
Very good instructor!  Very professional! Thank you!!!
a tip. mine would not turn anymore. i had noticed it was getting harder. i pulled it and gave the cartridge a good shot of liquid wrench. till it turned easily. this was just a temporary fix till i got my new cartridge from moen. saved me showering in the basement.
Can’t think you enough for posting this almost 9 years ago!  I used it to fix our shower and had zero problems as a result. Thank you!
BEST vid so far. I can tell you are not doing it for the very first time :) Thank you sir
Awesome! Very  thorough and right on point. Thank you!
This was by far the most complete and most helpful video I've seen. I needed the special T handle puller tool, and I missed the step where I could have used the special plastic tool to seat the valve body, which would have saved me a few minutes, but I got it done. I really did have to use steel wool, scotch brite and fine sandpaper inside the valve housing to get some calcium buildup out. I also found that using the Moen supplied grease helped seat the valve easily. This video was so much more informative than most, thank you for sharing. I saved quite a bit of money today.
Thanks for this video. I saved money by doing this myself. Really straight forward
my dad is fixing ours
I just finished this repair. Thank you sir for your  expertise.
Great video. Followed it close to a good install but screwed up when trying to put the new cartridge in which was tight and tapping in the stem valve itself which appears to have broken the valve. Sigh. Try again tomorrow. Hopefully somebody sees this and learns from my mistake.
This is the best video I've found! Thank you so much for making this.
Just fixed one just now. 46$ for the cartridge st Home Depot. Thanks!!!
My bathtub and shower  is a Moen  1200,   They Sold me the wrong one which was a 1225 - B   you have to have a Moen Stam puller. And you have to have a tap and die set and bold To pull the Cylinder out. You can find all this on YouTube.
Thank you.
Good one, though I’d have put the collar/cover back on.
OMG! This Guy saved us a fortune!!! Thank you Mr. GENUIS!!! HEAVEN SENT🙏
Worked Great for me!
Plug the tub just in case some parts fall down there
Thumbs up ramonasplumber!  Great video.  I actually used this video twice, about 2 years apart, and both times it was the perfect explanation to fixing my leaking shower/faucet.  Thanks for sharing the information and saving me money from hiring a plumber.
If you were to reverse the cartridge, C on top & H on bottom. Will the water be hot first and then cold?
Instructions not clear enough, got dick stuck in ceiling fan
A puller mmmmm
I cannot free up the  supply lines, any suggestions?
This helped me very much! thank you for posting
Thanks. On my way to HD now.
Very helpful!!!
Great video
Thank you.. gracias a usted me ahorre una buena feria! 👌🏽👏🏽
Thank you sir, daddy saves the day!
Thank you sooo much I bought all the tools needed at Home Depot and fix it within the 15 minutes of this video. I am sooo proud of myself.
one of the few tutorial videos online that walks the viewer through everything required in a very practical and thorough manner without a bunch of fluff. I agree with the others about the audio quality, but when you're stuck with a shower gushing out hot water, audio quality matters very little. Thank you for the comprehensive guide.
At 7:59 ladies how bout that action 🤣😜
My husband was out of town and I was home with 4 kids and had a shower that would not shut off.   I turned the water off and watched your video on how to repair a Moen.  Yep..no plumber needed here!!!  Thank you for your help!!
Why am I replacing these every 5 years?  I even had a pressure valve installed on the main to keep the water pressure low.  😱
Great job
People like you must live forever!
More problems with the  this brand  , save your money .
Thank you for the very detailed video! I picked up the cartridge and puller at Lowes. My cartridge was a BEAR to get out. Lots of gunk in the valve body.
Thank you!
THANK YOU! Exactly what I needed. I was about to call a plumber because nothing was looking obvious after taking off everything with a screw. I didn't know there was a replaceable cartridge. Thanks to you, now I know and know what to do about it.   Probably what should have clued me in it was failing was my handle didn't move all that easy. Then this morning it wouldn't turn off. Good thing I know where the main water shutoff is for the house. Replaced the cartridge thanks to the video and it operates like a dream. I can turn it the handle with a finger where the old one required some torque. Thanks again!
Thank you. Very informative and your video solved my problem
Quick question everyone,  how can I find out the model number of my valve? We bought the house 4 years ago, it is a  Moen brand, that's all. Thanks for your input!
Just replaced my cartridge...thank you for the detailed info !!!
Just used this video to fix our shower. Thank you so much!
Very nice video.  Where do you get the Moen cartridge?  How do you know the model #?  Mine looks older.Home Depot doesn’t have the Moen parts, just a substitute.
Thank you for your video, it has helped me.
Hi, can you tell me what number is that cartridge because I have the same moen
Thank you so much my friend,I took a good look at your vedeo the other day,because my neighbor had a problem with her Moen tub faucet.She called a repair guy and he did not fix the problem.I took a look at the faucet and it was a Moen single valve type  so I did all the things you suggested in your vedeo and pop goes the missile!! I fix her problem thank you you have made me a heroes in my building and now I have fix a couple of faucets made some money and new friends:)you the best keep those vedeo s commuting:) Victor from New Jersey
Thank you for this great Video, it help a lot to replacemant the water leak.
Just FYI Moen guaranteed for life just call and get the parts shipped! No hassle
Please put an old large towel folded over in the tub or on the shower floor. If you drop a part, you can chip or break the tub or shower floor. I pulled my Cartridge out by threading a same thread size as the handle screw, machine threaded Eye hook into the Cartridge.
Thanks for the up really helped me fix our problem!!
8:40 she’s a squrter!
This video was a huge, huge help. Thank you!
Thank you so much for this video- easy peezy
One of the best training videos or help videos.
This guy flat out does not know what he is talking about when he says you can't get the cartridge out with the standard puller!!! 100% PERCENT WRONG, YES YOU CAN!
A puller is a hundred dollars. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You Sir, are one of the best - if not THE best - instructors I've ever seen on here. Great job.
You the man!!
Great video. I would have used silicone grease to lubricate rubber bushings. Makes for smoother operation.
It’s cold out side my cold water runs in the tub with the knob turned off
What a great video!
Just did this myself it’s the help of your video, thanks!!
I can tell my Moen does not really go to warm right. I dump about 8mins of water or 6gals before I get the right temp.  Maybe it is filer time
Thanks man! Replaced my cartridge this morning using your steps
Thanks for saving me a little money.
You have a talent for instruction!
Thank youy. Worked for me
If the handle feels loose it can be due to the phillips screw being loose.
I put it now I don’t have hot water :|
If i can turn off the water to my shower with a shut off valve in my bathroom I don't have to shut off the main water do i?  Just double checking.
EXCELLENT DETAILED INFO. THANK YOU
Another great video. Thank you very much!
That is a well done job!  and thank you for a well explained job!
What’s your view on the Moen (OEM) solid brass cartridge ($50-$65 on Amazon) vs the nylon one ($25-$39 on Amazon)?    I have a son with autism who is very hard on fixtures and have gone through 6 cartridges in 4 years   ...about to do #7.  :-(
Fantastic video. Thank you!
The video is good.  The audio needs to be re-recorded.  The only audio track working in Canada is from the base speaker.
10/10 made this fix so easy! Didnt even need a plumber. Fixed it in like 30min or less.
My sister has a new moen faucet that the handle is to heavy and rotates to the full hot when trying to use it . I looked at it and didn't see any way of fixing the problem ?
Great video! Very helpful!! Thank you for posting it.
Thank you so much for this video. My shower faucet wouldn't shut off the water. I was freaking out and didnt know what to do. After watching your video; I went to Home depot to get the MOEN Cartridge replacement.... It was hard at first to remove from the tube due to a broken piece. Your video not only allowed me to fix the shower but also save me hundreds of dollars from hiring a plumber. Thank you Sir...not all heroes wear capes.
I can't get mine to come out
Thanks very much, this video help me a lot
No volume?  Can't hear him?
We regret to report this nice chap has now gone missing....but the local plumbers union is sponsoring a benefit at his old neighborhood Bar & Grill, the Dripping Spigot. All are Welcome!
You're the man! Thanks!
I HOPE YOU CAN HELP PLEASE! I cannot pull the cartridge because the faucet handle actually broke at the brass part that sticks out that the puller goes on to. So there is nothing sticking out of the rest of the cartridge to grab. How can I get the rest of the cartridge out? I really would like to do this DIY. THANK YOU!
muy bueno gracias
About how much would this cost to have it done professional?
Excellent advice and instruction.  The miracle of youtube.
Anyone know what size alan wrench to use or if there is a standard size for moen?  I feel like I have every size, but none of them are working.
Thanks for a very intuitive video
I agree that this was well done. Why? 1- it didn't contain useless crap 2- the video was extremely clear 3- it was easy to follow both from the dialog and video  My only concern is what might happen when I try to do this tomorrow 😨
Thank you so much very helpful
The hardest part is getting that set screw unscrewed.
Genius!. Thanks brother!.
Worked great. Thanks for the quick info!
Don't push on the brass stem, then he hits it with the channel locks, what happened to the lube dude ?
I will say even with that puller it's not fun when the cartridge breaks off halfway in the valve
My favourite part was where you lost, or almost lost, the handle set screw down the drain. First thing? Stopper the tub drain.
Mixers seem to often clog up with calcium.  I fixed mine by dismantling and greasing with silicon a while back, still good.  Not sure of the make but here’s the fix video for interest:  https://youtu.be/k8Aiem2kOgI
Thank you so much for the instructions. Worked perfectly.
how do you know that the problem is the valve? in fact, i'm not sure he ever identified the problem he was seeking to fix. put another way, could the leaky faucet (which I am guessing was the problem) have other causes?
Thanks so much for this.  My only issue was getting the handle to work correctly for the water temp (turn off) because I didn't remember how it was set it up. My total time invested was about 30 min. Took me longer to get the parts.
I would flush the system with the cartridge out.  You don’t want debris damaging the new cartridge.
great video! wish more DIY videos were like this one, nice job man. thanks
What would you do if it was dripping
I’m very glad I came across this video! Time and money saver for sure. Thanks for make this easy-to-follow, how-to-video.
I have one that when I turn it on the water barely comes out of the faucet, and when I engage the shower it takes a minute or three before water starts coming out. And it makes groaning noises. Is all that likely in the valve?
Is it really important to apply lubricant to new cartridge oval on both sides before installing it? I see lubricant inside cartridge oval, but Moen gives a small amount of lubricant in a plastic sachet. If I don't apply lubricant from the sachet, will the lifetime of the cartridge be shortened?
Hello, trouble with my repair. Handle is at 6oclock when I reassemble. I turn water supply on and water is coming out of spout when handle is in “off” position. Then at the 12oclock position water is off, then back on at 9oclock as I turn handle counterclockwise. I followed all directions as per the instruction pamphlet. Please anyone, HELP
I have this exact faucet. I just replaced the cartridge. But and the metal is now off. Turn it to the left it gets cold. Turn it to the right it gets hot. When I try to turn the stem, it turns the water back on.
I wish it worked as easy as it appears in this video.  I got the pulling tool, but the old cartridge is suck good; it wouldn't budge even with the pulling tool.  I actually damaged the pulling tool attempting to remove the stuck cartridge.  I quit because I was afraid I would damage the cartridge housing or the pipes by all the pulling.
Great video. Every Home owner should watch
Very helpful, but am I the only one that couldnt stop noticing that his watch band was unbuckled? Great video though!! Thanks!!
These things are junk
One thing he didn’t tell or show you was you need to use some plumbers silicone grease on the seals and “o”ring before you install the new cartridge. Hopefully you have the kind of valve that have the stop valves, 2 little 1/4 turn valves, one for the hot side and one for the cold side, that use a straight-slot screwdriver on it so you won’t need to shut the water off to the whole house. You will know that if and when you remove the trim plate.
I have cold water slowly leaking from the shower head when it is turned off and am looking to fix it. Would this part be the cause? I am too much of a rookie to know otherwise.
Good and this dude knows what he’s doing you can tell because he’s using a white shirt and it’s clean after the job
Thank you for this video. I have replaced the cartridge in the past without knowing what I was doing...and it took a while. I am about to repeat the job and your video is very helpful. When I saw “Ramona” I thought you were in another state, but you are actually here :)) I am in San Diego. I will pass the word around about your business. 👍
Hey, this was a great video.  Had to get the puller tool from Home Depot but it worked like a dream.  Went back and forth to HD twice.  First for puller.  Then back with the bad cartridge.  And Yes, HD did switch out old for new for free!  Thanks for the video and thanks for the commenters mentioning HD replacing for free!  Money saved!
I replaced my valve and now when it’s in the off position it leaks
Thanks man I just fixed my one
What size Allen wrench
Don't usually comment but wanted to thank you for this video. It was everything I needed and the fix cost me far less than it would if I had called a plumber! Thanks again
My problem is water is leaking from the area near the Allan key, is that still cartridge issue?
Thanks so much for the video. I was able to do it myself using the video.
Wait....I got it!!!!!  Great video 💪🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥
I did all that and still have a trickle of water....what did I do wrong?
I can save you more money on this. Go to Lowes and get the posi temp rebuild kit for the valve. I devised a way that works just like this 100 dollar puller. The trick is to keep the valve body stationary. I paid 13 bucks & change for the rebuild kit.
Thanks for a clear, useful video. You rock!
THANK YOU
Best video I have watched, now I am off to replace my leaky and stuck 1222B cartridge with confidence.
I have the moen plastic knobs and every few month they break,I feel it  not turning freely but the knobs cant stand any force and break easily""any ideas what to do??
Thank you! I was pretty bummed when I turned on and it was hot where it should have been cold. Helped me with the easy fix of flipping the cartridge and the notch. Back on track!
Is there any way to replace that metal clip? Mine fell and I can't find it
I know this is an old video but I wanted to say THANK YOU!!!!! You saved me money by not having to call a plumber.I'm subscribing to your channel for future repairs.
Thanks for the video, but--jeeze--I sure wish you hadn't repeatedly only referred to plumbers as "he." News flash: there are women plumbers out there.
Thank You!!!!!!! I was able to do this before work! saved lots of money
Thanks for the great step by step on the Moen cartridge video. I went to Home Depot purchased  a cartridge $47 a bit pricey, need my shower, and a puller $15. Watched the video several times. Be very careful with the copper clip. That step was a bit difficult. Proper alignment is critical. It took me a while, but saved some $$$. Thanks again
$100.OO FOR A CARTige puller I dont think so
Meon heat limiters suck!! Whom ever installed ours didn’t know what this guy knows! So I’m doing it myself Thank God for videos
these valves are garbage who was the dumbass that thought ''hey let's replace a metal rod connecting the valve with a plastic one'' then you need a fucking puller to get it off cause god forbid you just thread it like a normal human being these are trash damn the days of making every fucking thing from shit plastic and damn the fool who invented plastic. with my old valve all I had to do was tighten a small screw in the back from time to time with these shitty hunks of garbage you can't replace anything except the entire fucking valve here just let me yank $40 out of my ass for that guess I wont be having anything to eat for the next week....i'l give you a thumbs up because you explained this very well I just can't believe how cheaply things are made these days.......
Thank you very much for this extremely helpful video.  It was great that you took the time to explain where things could potentially go wrong during the replacement process.  I followed your steps to replace two cartridges that were not working properly.  One had stopped providing hot water, and the other could no longer control the water temperature very well.  Both were likely malfunctioning due to a combination of age and the hard water in my area.  Thanks again for such an informative video, it saved me from having to call a plumber.
Gratitude to this video (and the guys at Home Depot).  I had to buy a Moen Cartridge Puller, but that extra expense + cost of cartridge saved me a bundle in plumber fees. Thank You!
WOW!, Thank You Sir, I'm A Dumb Butt When It Comes To Plumbing, You Saved Me Mucho Bucks Buddy...
Perfect. Exactly what I needed. Thank you.
Great video thanks!
8 : 40 fucken funniest video Hahah but I agree whit his job very excellent work
Brüh you fingered that really well you have a WhatsApp?
I had the absolute hardest time getting that old valve out.  I mean hurt my back, drew blood, bruised my leg.  I didn't have or know about the metal tool. Ultimately I had to call my 15 year old home to tug it out.  The rubber valves were sealed to the pipe.  The replacement part for my shower was $50 #winning
Thank you for this demo!  It helped me fix my shower faucet that wouldn't turn off!  I didn't need the puller (which I did see at the hardware store for $20) so the only cost since I had the rest of the tools was the cartridge itself, which cost $40.  This video saved me the cost of a plumber and having to go without water until I could get one over to fix it (since I had to turn all my water off to my condo).
I did it! Thanks for your help! 🤗
Thanks, I watched the video yesterday and was able to replace mine today !  Everything went smoothly thanks to you !
Get a delta. You'll be grateful in the long run.
So just slide it in no turning the cartridge?? @ ramonasplumber
What tool did you use to remove the handle? How could you leave that out of your demonstration?
Thank you for this.  Mine was stuck due to a disintegrated washer, but patience and knowing what I was facing due to your video really helped.
Good job!
Followed this to the T and it worked out great! I appreciate the video. Saved me a couple hundred bucks.
Very useful, but in my situation the inner bronze stem is the one that broke. It's also stuck, so how can I pull it out? Will the fixture still work? Please someone help with info.
how to remove a shower valve moen
Why hot water stop running? Debris? O ring wear?
Thanks. If the home warranty company does the 'it's not covered by your policy' dance, I will, to quote Thanos, "Fine, I'll do it myself!"
Very well done video.  I appreciate your attention to detail and that you spoke clearly.  Now I am going to fix my Moen.
Thanks a lot, this video was very detailed and help me save a lot of money.  With your instructions it problem was solved.
I did it ,all by myself, tank you, for real tank you !!!!!!!! On less than 20 minutes I’m so happy
Great DIY video! Total cost for moen cartridge, extra moen pin, plumber's grease and a knock off puller at Home Depot $66.45! The guy at Home Depot looked at me like I was crazy when he realized that I was fixing it myself. (Yes, I know I'm a women and I am going to fix it, lol) End result, It works great, I saved a lot of money and all due to your terrific DIY video! Thank you!😊
What allen wrench y'all use
May have or may not need or may not ????? How much will it cost by the time you may or may not tell me the fucking price
great video! thanks for your help!
Informative and helpful,you is da man!
Wow this video is amazing. It helps a lot when the piece your trying to fix looks identical to the one in the video! It was a $46 piece plus a $12 tool that I didn’t use because I bought the wrong one. I was just informed by my wife however, that the moen parts are lifetime warranty so gonna call tomorrow morning to check.
TheJournalCEO - it's only widescreen on my PHONE (cell) not laptop.  weird.  GREAT VIDEO THANKS!!!!
Shower ace hardward stop
8:39 is when the action happens. You're welcome
I just finish changing the moen valve. Thanks for the help.
Is it possible for me to change a 1225 cartridge to a 1222 without changing the brass valve? I want to update the fixture but it’s on the old 1225 pull out & turn type handle
Thank you, I started the job before I watched your video and realized when the shower started leaking even worse than before, that I was over my head. I made an appointment for plumber to come out next morning, but the I decided to Google. I found this video and ran to the hardware store at 9 PM.  Bought the cartridge, and came home and replaced it. Done in about 10 minutes. And no more leaky shower head. Thank you.
Sorry, Gerg ... the intro music is good at half volume, but I can barely  hear you at all with the volume on my computer all the way up and my speakers all the way up. Looks like a good video though.
Thx u were a great help !!! Got it done
Great information! Instal was quick and easy
My apartment maintenance guy turned the limiter because I said the water would only get as hot as luke warm and I was tired of taking cold showers. A few days later I have no water from the shower at all .. and in the off it is just always dripping slowly. Turn it on or off no shower .. just always the drip. What happened? Did something break when he turned the limiter??
Very helpful, thank you for taking the time.
2:00 before he stops talking about what a professional "might have"...
No sound
Thank you so much for this video.  I was able to replace my leaking valve and stop all that dripping.  I was not able to see the H and the C to put the new valve in the right way, I had a 50/50 chance, of course it was wrong.  I had to correct it, and replaced the faceplate too. Although it took me a long time, and two trips to the local blue store to complete it, I now know more of how things in my house work.  I think it’s important to be able to fix the things I can without calling/waiting/paying someone else. Thanks and have a great day.
This helped me with a 2yr old problem just happened to look this up thanks this was probably one of the most helpful YouTube videos yet
Likd and sub
Thank you so much. I fixed mine after watching this video
Thus guy takes too long and talks too much. I don't need a video to try to scare me into hiring a plumber. I'm watching a video to do it myself. Can we simplify please?
That puller is also made by Danco & is at Home Depot for $12.00
What do I do when the hex screw gets stripped
Your video helped me immensely!  I had these exact Moen faucets and both broke near the same time in two bathtubs in my house.  The handle just spun but didn’t turn off the water.  I spent $105 on tools (hex key, puller) and replacement valve parts, and probably saved a ton doing it myself.  I will say that our old handles always had this rubbery feel when turning the water on and off ever since we bought the house (even the inspector commented on it).  Also, I had to almost pull my arm off to get the old valves out.  That’s because the rubber gaskets had gotten wedged inside.  The new parts turn WAY easier!  So I think at some point, the previous owner had overturned both handles causing the rubbery feeling and that led to the eventual break.  Anyway, all good now!  Thanks a bunch!
I bought an aftermarket cartridge from Home Depot and it still leaks slowly from the knob. Any suggestions?
Perfect video, perfect instructions! Well done, sir! Now I just hope I don't need that big puller!
my issue with the same moen valve is noise when it is turned just slightly in the cold area i've been told replacing the cartridge will rid of the hum is this true?thanks for your video
Thankyou so much sir it really help me god bless you
Hello, will it be OK to spray old cartridge with WD40 before pulling, so it will be easier to pull?
Hello Ramona's Plumber. This video was so helpful to me.  You are clear and concise. You are a wonderful instructor! Thank you!
You saved the day. Puller made a world of difference and glad I grabbed it on the front end.
Help me out today. Thank you
Thanks!!!! Huge help today!
Great video,  just follow this video and you'll be fine. Picked up the puller for 12.97 (danco for the 1222) and the cartridge for 39.00 at Home Depot.
Thanks for the video.  Good tutorial.  I subscribed.
Wow - huge thanks - looks like exactly what  I need. Yay!
MOEN IS THE LOWEST OF QUALITY FOR ANY KITCHEN OR BATH!
I tried and failed
Thanks for saving me $200 the day before Thanksgiving. The part was $44 and used a ChannelLock to turn the plastic piece and to pull the part out.
100% perfect this is excellent vid,..the only thing I would add is lubing the cartridge (silicon grease is included in the package)..Even when the receiver is clean (as recommended here) the lube will ensure no stress on the cartridge.
Fantastic video!  Took me less than 30 min to remove old cartridge and install new one and assemble new handle.  You can buy the parts cheaper on amazon but needed the shower so I spent a little more at Home Depot.
Thank you for this.  It was a huge help, a $40 part from Home Depot and a few minutes and my busted shower is working again.
Thank you so much! My husband and I used this video to help us fix our shower. Paid $42 for the cartridge and $12 for the puller @ Home Depot. The ability to do it ourselves: Priceless!
Thanks just fixed my shower tonight. Helpful video. Real simple too.
boi u look like a potato
this was an awesome video - the extra detail he gave helped me solve a problem I was having.  Excellent Video.
Greg Chick made an excellent presentation on how to remove and replace a MOEN shower faucet cartridge. It was very helpful to me particularly as I had to use a cartridge puller  to remove the old one. Greg suggested such a tool might cost upwards of $100. The good news is that Home Depot has one for about $13.00CAD which worked just fine for me. Thanks for your help Greg. Jim in Ottawa, Canada
Great video! Very helpful.
So before we must turn off the main valve?
How much dawn water is in there... after the old cartridge is removed ??  Before inserting new cartridge, don't you want to grease the oval rubber pads on the new cartridge and/or the opening where the cartridge is inserted?  I mean..  when you purchase cartridge, it does come with a small pouch of grease. Also, if you turn on your supply water absolutely last, you can install handle facing up, and allowing you to work like a "gentleman". Otherwise, excellent presentation!
N6
U make it sooo EZ.  Thank you.
Thanks to you I did it . I thought it will be complicated to replace it since I have never done it before but I was able with your video to do it.
I have the exact shower assembly you have. What is part number of the cartridge?
Don't forget the plumbers lube
my left ear likes this video
How the hell do I remove the plug if the brass rod is broken?
8:45 lol
8:39 lmao
Great video.  Followed the process and it worked great!  Moen faucets carry a lifetime warranty.  If you call, they will send you the cartridge for free.  Mine was indeed so stuck that I couldn't get it out with the little plastic thing he shows using to twist it loose so I needed a cartridge puller (like the $100 one in the video) but thankfully Lowes carries the 'Danco Core Puller for Moen' Item#86712 for $12.99 and it worked just like the one in the video.  I will say though, this is a cheap aluminum version but what the heck it worked fine.
Great instructions ! Thank You !
Thank you kind sir. God used you on tonight to help me replace my cartridge.  It was so critical because my water would not turn off.
your full of shit with that opening dude it takes twenty minutes and 50 bucks to fix most shower leaks
You saved my butt! Thanks!!!
thanks this much grief. A one-time-use puller is around $15 for us non-plumbers BTW
thank u sir, i was so stressed out before i saw this video, awesome
I fell asleep what did i miss?
Thank you for making and posting this video.  Yes, I can do it too.
first, i have done many of these in a motels for years. the instructor did not grease the valve or the valve body before installation, use plumbers grease or the one in the kit, thus it sticking hard all over again. also that shoulder pin is of the older models. it's copper or brass and very soft so be careful you don't bend it.it has to seat all the way down to prevent the valve from blowing part way out by water pressure
I took the trim off while trying to remove the old cartridge. Some water splashed behind the fiberglass shower wall, while the majority fell into the drain. Am ok or should I be worried?
Thanks a bunch Ramon! So glad that I found this video. I woke up to a shower faucet that would not turn off. Went to turn my water off from the hot water heater and began work, thanks to your video and the valve wasn't that expensive either. Awesomeness!
This guy is the Mr Rogers of plumbers
Thanks for this!
Thank you so much! your step by step very professionally presented video directions were incredible and very helpful in calming me down, allowing me to repair a busted valve. A 3:30 AM emergency was mitigated without the need to have a plumber come out. Your video, a quick trip to Home Depot, and we are as good as new. The directions were awesome and on point.   Thank you again
You rock! I absolutely hate plumbing but the video made this repair a piece of cake. Took longer to turn the well off and back on than it took to do the repair.
thank you thank you thank you so mach from East Africa good men really helps allot
Thank you for this instructional video. Replacing the cartridge was easier to do than I thought it was going to be and it saved me the hassle (and money) to call a plumber.
Ramon, thanks for the help.
very good video
Great video, saved me time and money!
Thanks for the video. My water shutoff was in my garage. two Insulated pipe with a yellow lever. I was able to use a locking grip pliers to pull it out. Bought a replacement at Lowe's for $39.99 (1222 model). I took the old one with me.
Excellent explanation. V much appreciated. Thank you!
I like that's
The most long winded explanation of a simple job!  Good lord......
Best vid of this type, straight forward easy enough for a 5yr old, Thanks Dude (without this the job was turning into a nightmare..with ALL water off in the house off, again thanks)
thanks, I was ready to call a plumber today, and looked this up instead.  Very easy to do, and the best part is Home depot gave me the cartridge for free.  A ten minute job, done and working like new.  You saved me a couple of hundred dollars!
This is NOT a valve replacement video, this is a CARTRIDGE replacement video.  SMH
what size allen wrench is needed
you are wrong you have to turn hot and cold water off if you go 180 deree and you have to pull cartridge out to do it. or you will ware the water going into tup. fool
There is no sound.
Hello, how can I replace an old delta shower and replace with a newer version?
I replaced the cartridge and the leak remains only very small
Thanks very helpful video 👍🏼🙂
a confident plummet wears a white shirt
My left ear knows plumbing better than right one. Thanks!
if my shower head is leaking after I replaced what should I fix?
thanks for posting this how to video.
Thank you. This video did save me some money.
thanks for the great video. I have a moen system with push down diverter and  lately water started coming out of both faucet and sprout at the same time. I replaced the diverter pin 1198 and the filter. still the same problem but now when I push the diverter the water gets to the shower, but still very little water from the sprout. Do you know what the problem is? I appreciate any suggestion.
Great video. The tips were very helpful. Thank you!
I replace about 8 of these per year. on the 1225, which is mostly plastic but at the end of it, there is a bit of brass. sometimes, it looks like it's scratched or nicked, even after only 6 months or so. why is this and is there a way to fix it? I'm worried after another 6 months it'll leak again
Yeah, but did you take it out to dinner first?
The faucet on my tub was getting harder and harder to turn and then it gave out completely causing the water to gush out uncontrollably.  I immediately shut the main water supply off.  I then found your video.  Thank you so much for taking the time to show us how to solve this problem.  You are a life saver!  God bless you!  Problem solved for $40 from home depot.  The cartridge came right out.  No need for a big puller!  Thanks again!!!!!!!
Thank you. Great video!
what time of hex key did he used? regular hex or ball end hex key?
undo your screws man gzzzzzzz come on now!!!!
Awesome vid! This happened to me during a blizzard recently. You helped me ALOT and saved me and my wife alotta money THANK U!
Thanks. I had a shower where the water wouldn't turn off no matter what we did. We replaced the cartridge (thankfully I didn't need a puller) and replacing the cartridge as shown in this video resolved the problem. Saved me from having to hire a plumber and only spent a total of about $40, instead of $200. Thanks again.
thanks you saved me $1200
Thanks! Just fixed my shower!
Hey, I changed it myself! I'm a girl and thought I couldn't do it, but your step by step video really helped! Thank you!!!!
Thank you!! This video was very helpful!
duh! First step, put the stopper in the drain so you dont drop any screws
did you shutdown your water from running to your whole house?
If I replaced this part and my faucet still drips is there another issue or was this not installed correctly? Thanks
Thank you. Great Video.  HomeDepot SKUs that I used for my project: Store SO SKU #1000897582 - Posi-Temp Pressure Balanced Shower Cartridge - $39.00Store SKU #404050 - Cartridge Puller for MOEN - $12.97
When I nut in my girl I pull out like 7:43
Fingering the water hole...
Great info thank you
Great video. My water would not turn off in my shower with the shower handle. I replaced the cartridge and I was able to turn off the water. The puller was $12.95 at Home depot & the cartridge was $39.99.
Thank you
Thanks. Went to Lowes, got the cartridge, greased it up and had it back together and showering in 10 minutes including putting handle upside down the first time :) Saved me a most likely $150+ Sunday plumber call and I look handier than I am to the wife :)
Yours was the best video.  We got it done.  Thanks.
thanks a lot helped me a lot
If a plumber comes, he *****or SHE***** will have the items you need...thanks for the clear and helpful video all the same!
Do you have a video of replacing the whole thing? Our is shot, need to replace handle, etc...
thank you
You could have easily broken that loose with the plastic nut they gave you.  Moreover, Moen has a lifetime warranty so in many cases just call the company and they will mail you a new cartridge.
LOL @ 4:18
We are able to fix this with your help! Thanks!
Thank you sir, everything worked like you instructed. I really appreciate you making this video.
Awesome!!! Thank you! you saved me big time!!!!
my wife took a bath and when she wanted to turn off the water the handle just kept turning without stopping and water did not turn off. so i had to turn off the main water.  I don't think its the cartiridge. what could be the problem!  help! you have a vid on what to do when handle does not turn the water off?
How do I know which cartridge I need? What I have look almost exactly as the one in the video but there are a few to choose from at Home Depot. Thanks!
very useful video.
Thanks so much. I was able to actually unclog my existing valve. Not having a puller made things much more interesting, but showing where that stupid release clip is allowed me to complete the job. On mine, when you put it to HOT, it would just dribble / drip. It hadn't been used in quite some time, and calcium built up stopping the hot flow. I may still get a proper puller and a new valve, but I can at least take a nice bath. My mom had been in a cast for a number of weeks, and the shower/tub had not been used since. I am staying with her for a while, and she wasn't even aware of the problem til I went to take a shower.
thanks! This saved me this morning!
THANK YOU! You saved me a bundle of money. Just fixed mine last night.
What size is the Allen wrench?  7/64?
Very clear and concise advise from Ramonasplumber. Thank you...
Was very helpful easy to do after watching your video !! took about 15 minutes start to finish . Saved me big bucks Thanks again !!!
that was very helpful thank you
informational but definitely selling to use a plumber. There's a video on how to make your own puller for like 12$ and the rest isn't rocket science...
Thank You very much for your video. Worked wonderfully.
Great video! Helped me fix my issue. One thing I would add is that given there are a bunch of different types of Moen Cartridges, I would recommend that people take a picture of the one currently in so they can show local home improvement store employees to get guidance on which one to get. I went to home depot and was able to show picture and they knew which one I needed from the pic.   Thank you for the video! Much appreciated.
Great help much appreciated ! Stef
Great video!  I followed your steps and replaced the cartridge in 10 minutes.  Thank you!!!
Great video, very helpful, shower fixed. Thanks!
I will try it
My handle won't turn the water flow off. Is this a cartridge problem or something else?
thank u so much honestly how much do u charge to fix  it  from a plumber
Great video its obviously still been seen in 2016. Thanks
Did you take it out to dinner first?
how can i replace a single handle presure balanced shower to a horizontal hanging shower panel787-392-w?
Nice video.  However, if I may offer a constructive criticism for future videos:  This video is more than three times longer than it needs to be.  Next time, write a script, refine and memorize it.  This video could easily be under 5 minutes.  Thank you.
Very good step by step instructions sir. Good job!
its shower porn
What do I do if the screw to take the shower handle is wallowed out? Is there any way I can take it out?
What was the kind of puller you had ??????
Moen cartridges are lifetime warranty !!!   call them up. they will ship you one for FREE !!!!!!!
Thanks.... this was very easy to do.
having a hard time with the pulling out at 7:00.Any advice?
This was a HUGE help. Thank you very much.
Thank you. That was very helpful.
really appreciate for video,  i have did fix mine few years ago. one of my friend came with BROKEN MEON left half inside i m going to try in couple hrs to pull out either drill a whole inside meon or try to Extract it out b/c its half inside never seeen this before that copper piece broke like that ........seem impossible
This was very helpful. Saved me a lot of headaches and a plumber bill. Thank you, sir!
Thanks so much for this. I found out the reason my hot water wouldn't come on was because that interior thing which limits how much you can turn it was set to the lowest setting by accident. Many thanks!
Great video.  I got the Moen cartridge and puller tool replacement kit for $19.00 on Amazon.
Videos
Fantastic so informative
excellent tutorial. I'm not a handyman type but thanks to your best video I got the job done!
May not be cheaper the first time, but the second time it will be. Or when the neighbor's or your children's needs repair. However, I cannot find a Moen cartridge puller for anywhere near $100 US. Most of them are under half that amount, including all steel versions.
The puller is $12.95 at Home depot,   the cartridge is $39.99
i bought a cartridge for 25 dollars and watched a youtube video.....viola....all it took was time....about an hour which includes going to the hardware store
Well done and I learned a GREAT DEAL.
My problem is the copper valve stem broke, so do I have to replace that t valve?
Thanks for the walk through, Greg. It made changing out my valve stem a piece of cake.
This guy saved me a lot of money. It is literally as easy as it looks in the video. Thanks, guy.
Thank you so much!
After replacing I still get leaks but only when cold water is on. Note that my faucet is single handle and when turn to hot shower don't leak but when warm and cold it does. Any ideas?
Sir, thank you very much for posting this. Not only did I learn something about my bathtub faucet setup, but you saved me a ton of money fixing a stuck cartridge!
poor audio
Silicone grease on cartridge prior to re-assembly?
Thank you very much.   This saved me at least $250 for a plumber.  The valve assembly was stuck. I'm very handy with equipment and repairs and it took me 2 hours to get the valve out without damaging the major plumbing.
Thank you so much.  Got mine replaced.  Very informative.
Very instructive.  Saved my bacon.  Have no idea why some had trouble hearing this.  Well done.
very very good, Thanks, saved me money!
...Quidquid praecipies, esto brevis
Very helpful...managed it ok after watching this...lots of effort to remove the old one though!
useless video this man talks too much
Excellent. Thank you so much.
Thank you for the video it was a huge help! Would like to also thank Moen on the life time warrant for all parts. Paid the $20 for overnight, arrived the next day, I can now turn my water back on too the house. The core puller for Moen made my job, less stressful, since it my first shower I had to fix on my house.
Hi, I tried to replace my cartridge and it's a Moen.  I could not find one that fits???  How could this be??  It's a lot thinner than the one you used.  Are there any cartridges that are obsolete??
Mine is very stuck where it is super hard to pull even with the puller on it. Millimeter by millimeter is progress... Any advice on this one? 😓😂
Great video, very helpful, thanks so much!!
thank you for the video.
the knock-off puller costs only $12 and worth every penny, the trick it getting the right value or you are running out to get the correct  one
Second time I have to fixed the shower valve.  One was 4 years ago and one is today.  This video is a nice reminder what to do and not to do.  Thank you very much Ramonas Plumber!!!
Thanks a million, your advise help me fix my moen shower. As a new home buyer, I love and respect my home a little more. You've  saved me, time and money.
I can't hear anything.Any advice on what to do so that I can hear?
Thanks for the video, it helped me replace my valve.  It would have been helpful if you would have provided the moen valve number, yours looks like mine which was  Moen 1222.
Excellent demonstration, very thorough.  Well shot. You made it easy for me.  Thanks!
excellent, I was able to make the repair with your assistance!
Two questions - does the house water need to be turned off, what if it still leaks?
could not hear shit
AWESOME!!! The Mr. and I followed these instructions and saved money and it is fixed!!
Thank you for this video! You've made it so easy for me to replace the Moen shower cartridge in my bath tub.
Thank you, it was a piece of cake! No puller tool needed. :)
My posi-temp cartridge valve copper stem broke off. Removed the retainer clip. The cartridge puller was only useful in turning the cartridge. There was no tool that I could think of to pull the cartridge out. TIP: turned the water back on and the cartridge was blown out of the pipe. Voila!
My Moen posi-temp cartridge was leaking around the stem.   I called a plumber and he replaced the cartridge.  All seemed good though it seemed to operate almost too easily.  The shower could be turned on with little pressure from one finger.  I have another Moen shower  posi-temp that doesn't operate that easily.  The shower worked for a couple of weeks then it wouldn't totally shut off.  Water drip slowly but constantly from the shower head.  I called the plumber back and he left me a message.  He said the valve body was not good and needed to be replaced.  This would require cutting thru the exterior wall (concrete and stucco) and replacing the valve body.  Estimate 4 hours work plus materials.  How likely is it that the valve body would go bad on a 9 year old house?  Does this sound right to you?
That's a $10 puller. Get one at Home Depot then return it when you're done. Boom.
What?  WHAT?  He sounds like the famous Swedish Chief for some reason!
tool 15.00, oem handle 15.00, collard 7.00, buttom 10.00, cartridge 35.00, why in the world are you ripping people off on the prices. so to replace one for a customer I charge 30.00, cust. purchase the cartridge, done in and out 20 min.
I'm going to try this weekend. I'm thinking try to remove it first, then see what is needed, mine is 25 y.o.
Thank you so much for this video. My handle was not turning on the water. I watched your video and after spending only 40$ for the cartridge my issue was resolved. Thanks again great info.
How do I know which valve I need?  1222 / 1225 / 1200???
where did you purchase the puller? (or any alternatives)?
Excellent Tutorial... thanks!
We just bought a condo that was built in 1980's, one of the single shower control has a slight leak, there is no markings on the knob (pullout and turn type) and no markings on the cover plate. I did take a pic of it if that would help. I'd like to replace parts, but not sure of the make or model. Appreciate your thoughts, let me know where to send pic,  Ken
Great video.  I see that the handle in your case has the dreaded "out too far" issue.  Many people have complained about this and its very annoying that Moen's rough-in instructions lead you to do it this way.  For anyone who does their own rough in, know that its not your fault if your handle sticks out way too far -- its Moen's installation instructions.  If you know this before you do the rough in, you can push it back in the wall a little bit to minimize the issue.
Thank tou, I did it all step by step. The only thing is now the water is dripping and you didn't address the situation at the end. What do I need to do if it's dripping? Thank you
Thank you so much for the video.
Excellent video and instructions; thank you so much for making the time to share. We will try to replace the cartridge ourselves to save money.
excellent video. thanks for the help!
Thank you so much for your instructional video.  After researching what could be done to repair my long time leaking shower faucet, I had the confidence to attempt this repair myself.  I also spoke with a couple of colleagues for added advice.  One colleague supported me, the other said I should call a professional before I made the problem worse. I listened to him for a couple of minutes but ultimately it motivated me to fix this leak myself.  SUCCESS.  I was able to accomplish everything you showed in your video, I am so proud of myself and I'm sure I saved at least $200.00.  Thank you for giving me the confidence to do a home repair, I know other women can do this too!
Perfect, detailed video! thank you, this was of great help!
Thanks for that video , today I save money in my house. thank you so much
I just wanted to say thank you for this video! Our moen shower valve wasn't closing properly and I went and bought a new cartridge and handle and followed the instructions on this video! I was scared at first since I had no prior plumbing experience, but you made it easy to understand! Thanks and thumbs up!
Your vid saved me some money!! Thanks my shower works like new again!!
Thanks for the extremely helpful information. I know its probably second hand to a plumber, but very helpful to me.
how do you know which cartridge you need?
7:45 let the Fingering begin and all that juicy wetness!! How many times he gonna finger that thing!
That faucet climaxed! like a porno. He shoulda Tongued it, after fingering it!
I just performed this task with the Danco version of the cartridge purchased from Lowe's.  Extracting the failing cartridge (18 years) was difficult even with the extractor, but I got the job done.  My only mishap was related to the rectangular gaskets; they just sit in grooves on the sides of the cartridge; when I tried to insert the new cartridge one of the gaskets popped off and fell into the space between the tub and the wall -- gone because of no access to that area.  I got replacements in a parts kit (again, Danco, from Lowe's).  Hold on to the gaskets as you slide the cartridge into the pipe!
Thanks so much for this handy video.  I was done in 15 minutes!!!
Great explanation!!
ok, nice video.... I'll give it a shot now....
Good job, good explanation, but as you disclaimed up front... I think I'm calling a professional to wrestle with this... what amazes me is your video has 1.3-million views; metrics show 56 views _per hour_. Cheap Moen big-box valves... that many people shouldn't be having that many problems, me thinks.
this dude just saved me $250.  Thanks Ramon.
very good video.  one tip for identify your cartridge being 1222 or 1225 if your has "HC" tab, it is 1222, positemp type
This video was great, completed the process in about ten minutes.  Puller only cost about 15.00 on amazon.
I think you enjoyed investigating that pipe for debris a little too much.
Awesome!  Thanks to you, I did it!!!  Thanks for the detailed video.  I'm not sure if you mentioned it in the beginning of your tutorial, but Moen offers free parts for life if you are the original home owners.  I built my house 20 years ago and am still getting free parts from them.  Moen sent me the cartridge, white plastic cartridge remover, and new plastic knob.  1-800-321-6636.  People can save even more money.
I want my owen bathroom !!!
Thanks for this video - saved the husband alot of time and frusteration.
thank you for video and encouragement.  i installed new seat, stem. in turned the stem in by hand. i then tighten the nut by hand, then tighten the packing nut to turn the stem in a bit tighter.but i had to tighten a bit more because water would drip downward off stem behind the tile stem. so i tightened it slowly until the drip stopped. but then it made the handle that turns off water uncomfortably tight, not as  easy as with the old stems. i am stuck. tighten the nut so no drip, but a little bit more then the handle is uncomfortably tight.  Help? I did put on teflon tape before install
Outstanding job! I followed this and was able to replace my values no problem.  Thank you very much for the great video.
Thx for the video .. Any ideas on how to fix this please https://youtu.be/fiP3JJgMaHA
My left ear enjoyed this.
Did you catch the prices of the replacement parts?  This is one reason why you NEVER buy Moen.  I have Moen infested throughout my house.  Like Moen says, "Buy it for looks, regret it for life."
it'd be great if i could hear it! all levels maxed, still could barely make out what hes saying
Thank you so much, really helped me understand the amount of work involved and the potential part costs.
Help! I need your help. My faucet looks very very similar to this but I'm not sure if it's a Moen (bought the house with it) it's developed a leak and I want to fix it.  Mine you PULL to turn on water and PUSH to turn it off. Left/right controls temperature.  How do I know which cartridge and cartridge puller I need without disassembling the whole thing? And if it comes down to that, I assume there's a model number on the cartridge?
This is a truly poor design. I'm sorry I ever installed these into my new house. I have 4 in all and as standard home maintenance replaced all the valves at 8 years. This is an unnecessary, complex, proprietary part. It wastes water as well because it's either on or off. If you want a slow flow of warm or hot water? Sorry, it gives you FULL blast whether you like it or not... A waste of water.
Thanks for sharing this video; I just followed this and saved me time and money!! Keep the good work up!
I have the tear shaped moen shower handle. I'm attempting to change it because it stopped turning my water off. Now, the center screw after popping off the center piece appears to be stripped as it will not come out. Any suggestions? or should I just call the professional now?
I have taken the set screw out of the curved shower handle, but the handle won't come off. I can't use a puller because of the curved handle. Any suggestions?
Super video! Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge.
Are we doing this with the water to the house turned off? I never heard that part.
Hey, thanks a lot. With a trip to the hardware store and a couple swear words I was able to skip paying a plumber to do something anyone could do with a little guidance. Again, thank you very much.
Thanks for posting. A huge help for this incredibly inept handyman (pointing at me).
Thanks for this time-saving and money saving video. You are an excellent explainer, and the video was well-shot and well-edited.
My faucet broke, the handle keeps turning but the water wont turn off. I had to turn off the main water. Will replacing the cartridge fix the problem like they did in this video? Does the cartridge work as a valve?
Thank you!  I just clocked myself at 1hr 45min to complete the job, including the trip to HD for the cartridge.  Woo hoo!!  So much better than waiting for a professional plumber!
Thx .. looks like you need several tools and experience.
Thanks a Million, I was able to pick up the cartridge at Home Depot for $39.00. I didn't need the puller I was able to pull it with pliers. The guy at Home Depot told me to call Moen and they would send me a new one free of charge. I didn't do that yet, I'm just happy I found this video and my shower is working again
This should be about 3 min max! Way to much chatting...
You gave me the confidence to tackle this job myself - THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
thanks, i got the puller for 12 bucks at home depot, then returned it.   it was a handy tool that places should simply rent for a few dollars  thanks for the vid
I subscribed also - I'm a lady plumber in training, and you demonstrate and explain things very clearly!!! Thank you, and God bless!!!
thank you for the video, it saved me time and money
Where do they sell the white plumbing dress shirts?
I just replaced with a new cartridge and it is still leaking. Any ideal what could be the issue.
This cartridge came out really hard.  The rubber pieces got caught in the hot and cold ports to the valve body.  I managed to pull it out, but had to dig the rubber out of the ports and pull it out with needle nose pliers.
Thank you sir! You are a very good teacher and you explain things very well.
it was well explain thank you
Great video with simple step by step instructions. Very well taught too.
You are a plumbing God!!!!!!! Thank You
how do you adjust the stem to make the hot water limit greater?
Thanks you. Very easy fix. FYI everyone reading, Canadian Tire, Rona, Kent & Home Depot provide part number 1222B at no cost as a warranty replacement. All you have to do is ask them.
Great demo!
This demonstration helped very much to at least know the types of value I may need or what the problem may be in case I have to call a plumber.
8:40 is my favorite part of the video....you know what you are doing
My house was just rebuilt five years ago. I can not find shut offs for my shower. Looked behind the wall where the shower is, and followed the lines from the basement up through the floor. Not sure what to do. I really don't want to empty my hot water tank.
Spot on directions...thank you.
Glad I watched this. Wish I hadn't started this project at 10pm when it's too late to buy what i need. Thanks for the help buddy.
great video, you good at making it clear and understandable.  subscribed!
Audio is terrible.
Great video with clear and understandable instructions. Thank you.
great video and that is one really nice shirt. Very professional look.
thank you very much for this video. after watching this, i was able to replace my valve. good job.
Thank you for the great Video.
do you need plumbers grease??? so the next time it will come out easier! been my experience! good video!!
The water won't turn off on mine even in the off position. I assume I have to change the cartridge like shown here. I attempted to unscrew the handle just to look at the inside, but the allen key doesn't seem to fit. Is there a standard size? Also any tips on how to unscrew it if it is stuck? It looks very circular inside and not hex pattern anymore.
Was able to correct the issues I was having with ease after watching this video.
Big help. My hot and cold were reversed by my plumber on install. Your video said to rotate the inner stem 180 deg. but that would leave the water on all the time. I had to rotate the H/C 180 deg. to get hot and cold on the right side. Thanks again
I think he needs a brain
Thanks for the video.  Mine was further in the wall which made it a little more difficult but I was patient and from your video I knew what to do.  I am female and live alone and it felt good to save about $150.  Moen is great they guarantee their products for life.  Got my 1222B cartridge from them free shipping too.
you are fantastic! bless you! you helped us with this video! you speAK SO clear!
Anyone who have repaired faucets in the past will find this project very easy.  Home Depot gave me a free replacement module.
Thank you, very helpful.
Great instructional video.  So many builders in southern California used this Moen "Monticello" series faucet.  The escutcheon trim and handle replacements are available on-line from a certain big name hardware store (initials are HD).  I've replaced them many times in our residential remodeling business.
Before you buy a new cartridge, call Moen to see if they will send you a free one.  If you are the original owner of your faucet, they will!  The cartridges all have a life time warranty.
I have an idea, how about instead of touting the need for a plumber, you just do what your video claims.
I used the Closed Captioning function to get the jist of the video.
Thank you very helpful  make me save money for Plummer service repair
Thanks for the video friend. Really helped in my time of need.
Very concise and instructive. I like the thorough explanation. Thanks,
Very helpful, thanks for the tip on the puller.  Good video but the sound needs work.  I only got the left channel and it sounds tinny (like you recorded it in the bathroom or something).
Wow!  Great video!  I owe you a drink kind sir!
Kinda of useless video when there's no audio - maybe need to upload again ???
IF YOU HAVE STICKS & TWIGS IN YOUR WATER SUPPLY .................... HOUSTON WE HAVE A PROBLEM !
7:58 shit just got real.
Is it possible to change different styles of cartridges to change how the water is turned on and off. Hot and cold. I have a Mixet style faucet handle. It has a on off section where I can turn, and next to that there's a hot and cold where I can turn. I wanted to be just simple like a moen u showed.  Is it possible to just change the cartribe and everything in the front like the knobs, etc. or do I need to do some replumming
What is the purpose of the cartridge? I noticed my Moen handle is getting tighter/stiffer to turn lately, I was hoping to take it apart and lube it but maybe I just need a new cartridge? My Moen kit was put in about 8 years ago.
This video saved me big bucks  - thanks! My son helped with the puller, other than that it was easy enough to follow your great directions.
Thanks for the video. Spent 15 trying to get the cartridge out before I found this video.
Thanks for the video. Spent 15 trying to get the cartridge out before I found this video.
Thanks you very much for step by step explanation.
Great video. Thank you. I followed each step and successfully changed the valve. And I pretty much always mess up. Biggest problem was getting the old valve out- ultimately had to use a crowbar to get leverage.
Thank you! Very helpful! FYI if anyone else has the problem I did: I turned the knob this morning and it broke off with the stem inside the handle and started spraying everywhere! Turned off the water and the stem had broken off about 1/4" inside the cartridge so I could not use a puller because there was nothing to attach it to. So I used a 5/32 inch masonry drill bit and drilled a hole deep into the broken stem within the cartridge. Then I screwed a gold screw in the hole, sprayed the cartridge with WD40 and used pliers to pull on the screw. It took some serious pulling but the cartridge slowly came out!
Hello ramonasplumber... I have a Moen, how do i know what model number is the cartridge that I need to buy.. and just to confirm i need to turn of the water from the main valve outside the house correct?
Thank you! Very well presented for DIY'ers.
WOW! Great explanation and right on the money.
very, very professional indeed. Thanks.
really nice explanation. my problem though si: what can be done when your brass stem that protrudes out is broken?  I am thinking of drilling and pulling it out like that.  what is your thought?
Excellent video. Having no hot water issue. But so far, my biggest issue is getting the allen screw out. And I have allen wrenches.
Thanks for your excellent video. I have one of these in the shower and another in a bathtub/shower. In the latter case, it is push/pull for water off/on--temperature control is the same as video. Is the push/pull water flow a different valve from the one in the video? Replacement procedure the same?
What he said!
One of the best how to videos I've seen
Great video. You saved my life. I had to take out the plate because the cartridge didn't come out far enough. But it was a simple extra step. Thanks!
thanks
Thank you very much.  This video helped a lot.
Do I need the lube the cartridge with the oil packet that comes with the Moen 1222 cartridge prior to inserting the cartridge?
I just finished replaveing mine but I have a leak ..why ?
What did I do wrong? Replaced it correctly, runs fine, but now the HOT and COLD are reversed?  Used to be left was hot and right was cold.  Can someone give me a tip?  Thanks
You are the MAN !! went to Home Depot, got the puller and the Moen 1222 for $56.45 inc tax and it took about 10 Min to fix. Thank you for your help.
On mine you pull the inner stem out, then you turn clockwise or counterclockwise for hot or cold, but it won't go back in on mine to shut off. Do you think I need to pull my skin out and have it replaced. On mind when you push it back in feels kind of rubbery even with water off
Forgot the puller.... that thing is tight! you will definitely need one...
Oh yes   I didn't buy a puller
Hi  I just replaced my moen cartridge  was easy peasy   although I was worried in the beginning about the warning regarding that it could become more involved   I do have a question   I still have a slight drip after the new cartridge is in   the valve is a push in to stop water flow pull out to start   I've been in this house for 15 years
$40 in parts and tools (including the puller) and I got it done.  Thanks for the video!  The puller is a must for this job!
Good instructions!   Bill Jones
Just also wanted to say thanks. Very helpful and was spot on! Great Video. Also...Yes, get the puller...lol makes it a breeze. got one at HomeDepot for only 13$
Very helpful ,thanks...
The Delta system is a lot easier to install than the Moen as I can see here.
just repaired my shower!  symptom was no hot water.  $39.95 for replacement cartridge at Lowes.  sweet 8)
good pix.
A tenant of mine notified me that the shower faucet lever was getting stuck. I began searching for videos that could teach me what may be the cause of the problem. I saw this video and found it to be VERY helpful. Im pleased to say that I was able to repair that lever by myself! It was due to a jammed cartridge. I took the exact same steps from this video and completed the repair. Thanks Ramonasplumber!!
Very helpful, thanks.  Nicely done.
I hope this video ...helps me.... I don't know what I'm doing
Thank you so much for posting this video and sharing your expertise.  The whole project took less than an hour.  Zero cost vs. ???$$$$$ if I had to call a plumber.
Thanks so much for sharing!  Saved me a ton of money and I learned something.  Excellent explanation!
It is easier for Ramonasplumber to demonstrate this, using what is probably a brand-spanking new demo valve, than is for you, dear viewer, to actually accomplish same.  If you have hard water, as I do, this valve is doomed to fail and it won't take long for that to happen.  It is unlikely that you will be able to remove the cartridge without a puller.  I couldn't budge mine.  You can get a cheap puller at Home Depot for about $13.  It will work, but probably only once, because the tangs that fit around the valve will bend and on 2nd use, likely shear off.  But it's better than paying a fortune for a pro-grade puller.  You must use extreme force to get the valve out because the rubber gaskets on either side of the cartridge will bind inside the valve body.  These came out in pieces when I finally managed to rip the cartridge out.  The inside of the valve body must be cleaned to remove any lime build-up or other detritus.  I used a small wire brush followed by fine steel wool.  When you install the new cartridge, even after applying liberal quantities of the oil that comes with it you may still not be able to seat the cartridge all the way into the valve.  To solve this, I took a  13/16th 1/2in drive socket, placed the cheap plastic tool that comes with the cartridge over the valve stem. followed it with the socket and gently clubbed it with a rubber mallet to get it seated.  Be warned that you had best get the cartridge positioned correctly the first time for hot vs. cold rotation.  Because if you don't, you will find that you cannot simply pull the cartridge out slightly and rotate it 180 degrees - oh, no.  Instead, you have to withdraw the cartridge as much halfway because those pesky rubber gaskets will again bind and prevent you from rotating it.  Good luck in your endeavors and next time buy something else, as I most certainly will.
Ben,  no offense taken,  yea sometimes they say "we don't have any" or what ever.  Back in 94' they did a grab n go thing at the counter,  but now it's metered out.
Those cartridges are guaranteed for life. Just contact Moen and they will send you out one free of charge and postage paid. I'm sure these plumbers collect the money for the cartridges from you and get them free from Moen. That wouldn't be called double dippin would it?
how to fix a moen shower valve thats not allowing the hot water to come on all the time/???
I thought Moen was guaranteed for life? Why do you have to pay for a replacement cartridge? Can't you get them for free as long as you exchange your defective one?
Really helpful. The puller was only $12 at Lowes. The first time I turned it on, it went cold, off then hot. Took it apart and made sure the top was lined up right and it worked great the second time. Thanks!
This would be much better if you focused in MUCH closer and didn't use this crazy widescreen view.
My only problem is that hot is coming out first.  Do I have to take the pin out or can I just turn the stem 180 degrees?
I bought a removal tool from Lowes ($15), removed the cartridge and took it to the local pluming store, got a new one ($45). Went home and replaced in just a few minutes. Thanks for the step by step video. Even thought I bought the removal tool I still saved a lot of money. Thing is the faucet is barely 2 years old.
Thanks for the video. I am having a problem with hot pressure only. Did all the steps you outlined and changed out the cartridge. It had some crud on it.  Even after putting a new cartridge, the water pressure hasnt gotten any better. Any suggestions? If I remove the limiter.. should i remove both the white pieces or just the small one? Thanks for your help.
What do you do if the allen screw is stripped and corroded?
This was very helpful. Thank you!
The exposed plastic part of the cartridge that's in the pipe.  It's the part that has the H and C.
Scraping of what?
I don't know.  Didn't buy it, but I believe is was $16 bucks... or I'm hoping.  I think we should have used a cloth to avoid the scrapping.
What puller did you buy?  the ONA puller is about $80.  it does everything,  and well.  The Pasco is famous for pulling out the inner stem and then you need to use the button on the end to get the rest.  Professional plumbers have many yrs. training and thousands of dollars of tools .  This is why plumbers need to charge over $100 to come to work.   Plumbing can be tough.   Water caused corrosion.  Water can be treated to stop this,  but treatment systems cost mony...
Finally done.  The puller actually made it worst.  First the puller tore apart some plastic which just made it twirl.  Then my dad manage the rip out the metal part of the cartridge leaving the rubber and outer plastic cylinder still inside the pipe.  He took a break, and I went crazy at the remanding cartridge parts. Since I couldn't pull it out, I tore the thing into pieces and it worked.  New one slide in nicely.  Thanks for the replies.  Wasn't professional, but that cartridge had it coming.
Yes,  a puller is made and sold to remove the cartridge,  get one or call a plumber that has one.  Hot a good idea to turn off hot water at tank because the cold will push thru the single handle cartridges and make noise as it damages them.
Thanks.  It worked, but now a new problem occurred.  It looks like I'm going to need a part to pull the cartridge out.  Tried to pull it out with a wrench, but couldn't get to it.  I think I need some sort of cartridge puller.  Anyways, is it safe to constantly turning off the hot water valve from the heating water tank?  I leave a hot water faucet on and then open the valve.  I've noticed that, if I didn't, it would make a strange grumbling sound.
You mean the escutoen trim plate?   no problem,  two screws.
Nice vid. But, as usual, mine is going to be a bit different where I have to remove that entire back to do this.

Wow - one of the most useful videos I've ever watched on YouTube. You just saved me about $225 to have a pro do this - THANK YOU!!!
China made parts have low grade plastics and materials.   Not thermal stable...
I did the same thing. The original brand is Moen. I bought what Homedepot carried (not Moen), three times, every time it starts to leak after one week. Finally I saw Moen at Lowes, and bought one. It solved the problem instantly. So I guess you need to buy the exactly same brand as what you currently have.
Save water,  save money and pay a pro. when needed.   DIY is a good thing for just this,  glad to be of help.   Tell a friend,  I like the viewage... and or tips on the home page pay-pal tip jar!
Excellent video,very thorough, informative and clear. Thank you. Both of my moen showers had this issue.
Tool prices vary on which tools you get and where you get them.  The ONA tool is $75.  and if you ever need that heavy a tool it is worth it,  but not likely unless your a pro.
Great video.  Gives us novices a place to start and see what's all involved.  It helped me know what all the tools I'll need.  Also, I would have the heavy duty puller on hand....I know my luck!   Thanks again.
I just wanted to take a minute to thank you for this video because I don't think I would have been able to fix our shower without it.   The parts and the tools were less expensive than you mentioned so I was able to fix the shower for about $50 which included tools I can use in the future.
Thank you for watching,  tell a friend and let me know if you need any plumbing ideas or advice.
The handle limiter plate,  see it in parts explosion.   The piece goes onto the stem and the handle goes on after.   It is the handle adapter.
I have flushed many valve bodies too.   I look into the cartridge hole and feel with my finger. The only issues I has seen are when a piece is left in and is at end of hole not allowing the cartridge to go in all the way.  The clip wont go in in that case so you know the cart needs pulling again.
Hi, I have replaced moen cartridges many times with no issue. recently I replaced a 1225 cartridge and when I removed the cart, it left behind a small amount of the rubber 'diaphram'.  the cart was stuck in pretty tight and I used a puller so it got riped up and small debri was left bechind.  to fix I pulled it out and briefly turned on the water with the cart out to clear the debri.  try this and it just may work for you.
I have replaced the cartridge two times and it still leaks. I am using BrassCraft made in US. Since you have so much experience, you are saying that it is normal for "knock off" brands to leak brand new? (Not just the one's made in China?) If so, let me know and I will try once more with a Moen cartridge. Only a few bucks more at home improvement store, just wasn't in stock when I bought the replacement.
You will need a new handle and the post it attaches to will come with the ball,  so it matters not.   Look at the video,   the handle attaches to the ball stem.
I drilled the allen key nut but I am afraid I might go too far and damage thread or will I be replacing that part as well?
Hardware store!  The handle screw is just that,  drill it out, then unscrew dome nut like in video..
so I dont have to change whole facet ?? just the guts? where can I buy the guts ? I have a delta facet
Drill it out.  Call a pro.  or break off the handle and replace all parts of the valve body.
Nice vid but how can I get handle off if allen key was stripped? Its a delta facet .
thanks for the introductory comments about the plumber ! I'd rather hire him for this project.
Use a diverter tub spout.
I've installed a similar moen bathtub faucet. When I turn the handle water comes out from the faucet and shower head... How do I troubleshoot that?
Thank you for the easy to follow instructions, My brother fixed and I adjusted the water temperature :)   Thanks again saved money.
Hi, having hard time removing handle because set screw allen wrench hole is stripped out. I have been trying to drill it out so I can get it loose. Not sure how far I must go. Is the set screw seated into the black plastic end piece or the brass shaft. I am a do it your self grandma and x-plumbers wife, trying to help another grandma. LOL Thank you for your time.
Yea, one needs to know quite a few things to get around different plumbing repairs.
Thanks again, it was a philips head screw under the cap that is nearly invisibile!
This was awesome! I had a leaky shower and I followed the instructions. Worked like it said it would. You can also use a vice grip to pull the old cartridge out, just pull it gently and it will come out. Great video.
Thanks a lot for posting this. Had some serious issues with my shower and your video helped a lot. Apparently my main issue was the restraining clip(or whatever it's called.) That thing was loose and about 80% of the water was coming out the handle, highly irritating. Due to you mentioning how important that is, I found it and fixed in no time.
If you live In condo, be sure to have them turn the water off first,,,
It is an Allen screw 3/16 size and on the side,  or in center under a button dot.
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS!  My Moen Shower/Tub valve just quit last night, so here we go! I can't find the "screw" on the plastic lever to take it off, however. (nervous laughter).
Most homeowners could be better informed on how to stop leaks.  Thanks for watching and conserve water.
Thank you. I'm not handy man, but your video helpful for people like me.
my problem is very serious. the ring that connects the collar to the valve has broken off inside it. i have gotten the puller, but because the screw broke off inside it, there is no room for it to grip. i cannot get the valve out. please help?  also. the valve construct is BEHIND the wall, i can get at it, but not from the sides. any help would be beneficial
I agree,  OEM stuff is generally better the risk and reward in plumbing repairs is weighted on risk not reward.   As a pro. I have no choice but to have the best.
Yes.
Is this the most probable remedy if I am getting cold water to the shower but not hot water? Thanks for your help.  Woo
Remove the clip and rotate the whole cartridge,  then set the brass stem.
I would use the Pasco T handle one, it is cheap and effective.  I own 5 different pullers they all have different attributes.   If you have a positemp valve you need the puller for positemp.   If the valve only turns it is the posh temp.  If it pulls and turns it is the older style and the Pasco brand T shaped  puller is cheapest and works.   Be careful,  if you break the stem in the cartridge you will have to have some more skill to finish.   A professional Plumber could be a safe choice.
Can you PM me and send me links to exactly what you would recommend? I fished around the 'Net, but was not sure exactly what you would recommend. (Thanks!)
A puller can be had for under $20 and cartridge under $50,  so under $70 will do it.
I see everything i need is a bit pricey, and i do rent here. It's not broken so the cost would be on me. I'll think about doing it myself and also calling a plumber and getting it done professionally. Thanks for the reply and the vid too! We all appreciate it!!!
No your DIY job cost you a new valve body.  Using a puller helps prevent the stem from breaking off and making a small job into a big one.  Professional Plumbers are best because they have the pullers and torches to replace the valve.
That is the reason, yes. be careful,  you will need a puller
Nice video, I work in an apartment complex. We have moen showers and faucetts. Your video is perfect for me. Thanks.  But I have a question. We had few service request about shower noise. When they need to use the hot water in the shower , that noise is too loud  One of the guys fixed closing a little bit the hot water pressure. But the people complained the next day about the low hot water pressure. What do you think about this noisy problems in the shower. What I need to replace or adjust?
My shower handle is a bit hard to turn - perhaps too stiff would be a better way to put it, always has been (my neighbor has the same handle/same problem). I've been through 4 or 5 different plastic knobs that broke because of this, so i finally found a metal replacement, but it gets loose real quick (you know why, a bit hard to turn). My question is would a new cartridge solve this? w/b and thanks!!!
ramonasplumber,  I believe this would have worked perfectly if the corrosion would not have locked my valve body in the sleeve.  After 2hours of struggle, I ended up taking out the valve one small piece at a time.  Once it was out, I easily installed the new valve.  However, in doing so, I now have a new problem.  There is a huge leak around the valve.  It's almost as if the sleeve expanded or bent open during the exchange.  My question is, can I fix this by using a larger O-ring to seal?
Moen has them.
u know that screw that keeps the plate in what size is it because i tried looking for it on the internet
A new cartridge is what you need unless your pressure is over 80 psi, then you also need a pressure regulator as well.  Do regulator first.  See my video on pressure regulators.
Hi, thank you for producing this video, your generous knowledge is much appreciated. I have an moen shower fixture that has an older style  handle, before I buy parts and everything, how can I identify it needs the same valve mentioned here? By the way this for a constantly dripping faucet, please let me know if I'm headed in the right direction. If not a general nudge in the right way would be appreciated. Thank you!
Even a baby can do it.
Thank you so much for having this video available.  We were having an issue where the water would shut off before the hot water would turn on.  Ran to our local hardware store, brought the laptop into the bathroom and changed out the cartridge fairly quickly.  Thanks again!
Thanks for your comments!   tip jar on diy plumbing advice. com home page....
This guy rocks, he saved me bookoo bucks.  The part number shown in the video is the Moen 1222 (Lowes 39.00 usd), and I bought the puller at Ace Hardware (16.00 usd).
All he needs is his jacket and tie then he'll be in his cubicles shower office
OEM  is right, you are One MixDJ, absolutely, I agree with your, thanks for the back up, China just can not make a moen cart.  I tell everyone this, and hope they listen to US, pun intended.
Greg, second time around and this video again came in handy. And may I suggest to all to please try your best to get the actual Moen cartridge instead of Danco. I originally used a Danco the first time around (scroll down), and it failed that quick. I got the Meon at Lowes for $40. Say NO to Danco! :)
Anywhere from $125,  to $350,  you ask, why the spread?  variables are plenty.   I suggest reading my blog at my other site called why do you not get a plumber when you hire one.  I say this because the blog is about just your question.   Are they insured, are the parts domestic OEM, are other tasks done as policy that are part of a better service, do you really need a new cartridge, or is the chief complaint you called about and are wanting a price on just a symptom of another problem ?
How much can I expect a plumber here in Miami fl charge to do this job? Thanks in advance
Bingo that is the fix!
Faucets have hot water and yes when the handle goes fully to the hot direction flow goes to near zero with only a trickle of cold coming out.  So if I remove the cartridge and take to home depot, will they give me a new cartridge free (lifetime guarentee?).
Does the bathroom have hot water to other fixtures?   Does the flow decrease when you turn the handle fully counter clockwise?   Do you wait long enough?   Yes a new cartridge corrects hot water not flowing...
Thanks for your video.  Very helpful.  My shower valve does not bring hot water ever.  I took off the handle and the limiter is straight up at the 12 o-clock spot.  Also tried rotating the stem 180.  at no time does this ever bring hot water.  I just bought the house and the inspector missed this tub....Do you think a new cartridge will do the trick?
What was the manufacturer of the part, I know it was for Moen, but was it made in China for a company called Danco? I have found the knock off 1/2 price $10 parts are not good, they leak.  The posh temp knock off parts are $25 and they are no good either.  If you buy the Moen 1225 cartridge you bought the real thing.       If you buy a pressure gauge for $11 you can test pressure to know if it is 80 or less.  If over 80 psi you need to reduce it.  Call a plumber.
I don't know how to know the pressure or if i used an oem part? It's leaking after put back together when the water is turned off, its leaking a quick drip.
Why did you do what? and did you use an OEM part and what is your pressure, and what is leaking?
I did this, thanks for helping! Now my faucet leaks, please help!
Very educational video. I like to consider myself a do-it-yourselfer, but plumbing is the one thing I've never really fooled with, so I was clueless. After searching high and low for a puller (which I most certainly needed), the whole repair took just a few minutes. Thanks for helping me fix my dripping shower head!
As in Possessive, singular.  For you scrabble heads..
Ramona's only, Ramona-only, Ramona's plumber.  You figure it out!  :)
One needs to view my videos before trying to repair.   The cart needs drilling out then use a puller to remove the outer half of the body.  Or call a pro.
Ramona's Plumber has been working on our plumbing for years.  He's a fascinating and brilliant individual and an artist and craftsman.  I am proud to know him.  Congrats on the success of these videos, RP!
Your cartridge is jammed.  Replace it, that is why people watch this video.  read the way many comments below from dozens of people with same situation.,  I have responded in detail  many times.
my shower look exactly the same. my issue is I don't have any leak. first I didn't have any water coming when I turn the Handel to the Hot side. I did open it by following the steps in your Video then the water came out but it still cold what would be the issue in your opinion? thx.
Your welcome, tell a friend, and save water as well as respect water...
Thanks, I try very hard to do my best at everything I do.
Yep. 9/64th. tks!
I think all of them are same and not metric, dont know the size, but if I remember it is a 64th. fraction
i use to be  plumbing supervisor ,and i can see you are a very good teacher ! good video !
It's definitely an awesome tutorial! Quick question though, is there a standard size for the Allen wrench? I have a bad set and it seems to be one of the one's I don't have. Thanks for all your help!
Thanks for your comments,  don't forget a tip jar is on the diy plumbing advice site ! and tell a friend on Face book or tweet me..
Hey, I agree, I say the tools can cost up to a hundred, but that is for all 4 of them.  Then there  is the Ona Puller that is about $90., just for it, but the Hardware store one has gotten real cheap, (China).
Do not dick around. Buy the cartridge puller tool. It's only 13 bucks. The job was a cinch. Thanks for the video.
Back @ ya.
Thank you for your help,God bless you...
Go to hardware store and get a Moen Puller, they stock them.
Can you give some info as to what the puller you used was? Im having the same issue where the white plastic cap seems like it will snap? Thanks!
I meant very much!!!
Thanks for the video it was Betty available I managed to do it myself and I save some money thanks again.
Thanks a bunch, very informative.
part when You fingering the pipe was the best.
Water pressure over 80 psi will cause it to leak, you need to check the pressure and lower it if it is too high, buy a gauge and test it.
Tell a friend where I am for them to learn,  face book?
What is your water pressure?
Two screws came with the new handle!
This video was extremely helpful!!! Thank you very much for sharing this information with the 'average' homeowner (like me)! You saved me a bundle by giving me the information necessary to understanding the cause of the plumbing problem, as well as the info on how I can fix it myself. THANK YOU!!! Have a great day! :)
I think that should be noted .. And since we are in the shower, also suggest not dropping the soap.
Next step after turning off water is to stuff a rag in the drain opening.
Dam, a new screw comes with a new handle, Or go to store use the stem they have to size a new screw, but it must be brass or stainless steel.
Dropped the knob screw down the drain.
Well, did the video help you fix your leak?  then back at you, good work.
BRAVO GOOD JOB.
Prices have come down, as China has become dominant,  my tools were bought back long time ago......  ACE Hardware often stocks them as well as OEM parts...
Thanks,  be it posted 7/64ths.
One thing DIY people will ask is "the size of the allen (hex) key". For Moen screw 94770, the hex size is 7/64 SAE.
Plumber's grease is NOT recommended. Use pure silicone containing minimal or no petroleum carrier or silicone-based grease (Moen part number 99915). Do not use plumber's grade faucet grease, silicon sprays or any lubricant that contain petroleum. Petroleum based lubricants may react with rubber seals and actually cause the faucet to become even more difficult to operate, ie. harder to turn.
Followed your advice and the slow hot water problem was fixed in my shower, thanks for the great tutorial.
Read down the comments below there is a dozen of the issue..  break it out!
There is a large white plastic ring inside the shower that I can not remove to get the clip out. So, help! How do I get the clip out?
Pardon my clarifying ,  you mean breaking the stem off from the cartridge? and extract the remaining part out of the valve body?   or the valve body of of the pipe connected to the valve.   ?   Read past comments and replies there are many on this issue.     BTW, I buy US made anything I can even when it can cost double, I consider it a responsibility and an obsession.
so if you break the valve off, is there an easy way to get it out of the pipe?
I should have mentioned that I had done that.   I use silicone NSF 51 approved
That's a lot of water draining out. U sure you turned the main off?
You forgot to apply plumber's grease on the cartridge before installing--please correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks
have you a rotated stem?  try removing the handle and rotating 180 deg.
Now it won't be called a "Moan"  spread the word on FBook more people need education..
Beauty. Thanks a ton. Moen has never been explained easier.
Brag and say you read the instructions!  she will love it.  Share me with your Face Book friends if you do that social webbing...
Thanks!  Just the info I needed.  Just have to show the wife what I did, or just keep this all a little secret, lol.
Do you have a posi temp valve?
Could you please tell me what is going on with my shower faucet. When I turn the handle all the way to hot the water will shut off. I don't understand what is happening and how to fix this problem. Any suggestion would be much appreciated. Thanks!!
I replaced the valve and it worked fine for a few weeks.  Out of the blue, I turned the shower on and the water pressure increased dramaticly.  Now it blows through the hot water twice as fast.  The pressure increase is only at the tub faucet.  How can I adjust that to lower pressure?  Did I do something wrong installing it?
Put some styrofoam in between valve and wall.
I always use silicone grease on threads that might bind.  I never seen a cart jam on a puller ....  you tell me what worked...
Ramonasplumber. This was awesome.  Only paid 50 bucks (for parts) to fix my shower. Thanks so much.  BTW: How to I remove the old cartridge from the pull?  The old cartridge is on there real nice and I can't remove it? Thanks!
The cartridge should pull out so smoothly and easy, the valve body should not move.  New cart.   As for poorly installed valve bodies,  remove the round plate with two screws below handle and stuff styrofoam in the space between wall and valve.   replace trim plate with sealant behind it at outer edge for a water tite seal.     A new Magnum 1225 by Moen, for Moen  OEM !  will do wonders.
When I pull the Moen shower handle towards me it pulls out from the shower wall about 1/2 inch. Is there a way to secure it from moving?
Very nice instructional piece. The puller at my local Home Depot was $15 and the part was $40. Also I had the added complication that the shaft had been broken. This complicates it greatly. I glued it back on and it held sufficiently to use the puller. Eased it out enough to get a pair of vice grips on it. Thank you Raymonasplumber!
Thanks for being a great student, post me on your Face book if you do face book stuff.  Others can enjoy and I get the pleasure of thanks!
Break away the plastic that is in way of the clip.
Jacuzzi cleaning can be done with 1/2 gal bleach  30 min.  jets on.  open windows because the bleach out gasses and can burn the hell out of eyes...Then drain all water out.
Thank you very much for super quick response, I broke plastic tile guard and will finish the job now. I'll check your channel out later and see if you have tips on how to clean out a jacuzzi, my next project.
The plastic thing was supposed to be removed before the trim plate was installed.  the plastic tile guard is not needed anymore yes break it away so you can remove the clip.   some unskilled "plumber" left it there...
Your tips on this video thoroughly explain the importance of each action. I was very confident I could do this after seeing video. However I am stuck on the removal of thin key pin. I cannot access it because home mfg put some circular ¼ thick plastic thing surrounding the valve. I cannot lift the key because this thing is behind the shower wall and has a larger diameter than opening in the shower wall to access the valve. Do I break this circular plastic component, if so with what? Thanks
That pin is necessary to keep the house from flooding...
What is the water pressure?  tell me more, how old is house do you have solar water heating do you have well water
The dripping is coming from the shower head now.  The reason he replaced the cartridge is because it had broken off at the base of the stem of the cartridge.
My husband purchased the OEM Moen cartridge and replaced it according to your instructions.  However, the dripping is incredible after.  Do you have any suggestions?  We don't have the funds to hire a plumber at the moment.  Thank you very much in advance!
If the valve has it's own shut offs you can use them.  If the valve has no shut offs it is necessary to turn off the whole house to replace the cart.   Shower valves can have their own stops, but it costs more and most jobs are too cheap to buy valves with stops built in...
Very informative video, thanks.  Just have a question, is it possible for me to change the cartridge without turning off the water supply from the main switch.  We're having a hard time going down in the basement to turn off the water supply because of my wife's sickness.  It will help me a great deal if I don't have to go downstairs to turn off the main switch when i change the cartridge.  Looking forward to hear from you soon.  Thanks you so much.
I really have had bad experience with China mfgrs. on  repair parts that require tolerance, thermal properties, or UV resistance and anything that needs quality that cant bee seen till the pressure or heat is on.  I find it sad that stores stock this stuff.  look in Wall Mart most all toys, pet stuff and such is China, US made stuff is as rare as can be now and we sent all our money away ...  I am not speaking about politics, just common sense and leaks.
Thanks for the response. 60 lbs pressure at inlet to home (city water). The valve was made in China. Guess I will purchase a OEM valve and try again.
Do you have high water pressure?  did you buy a Moen by Moen OEM part or a for Moen by Danco or some China made crap?
Watched your video and changed out the valve on my shower (shower head only). I changed it since there was a small drip from the shower head. However the shower head continues to have a small drip. I used the valve from Ace. Any advise on what to try next? Thanks
Thank you, we care and are setting new standards in the Plumbing business.  Face Book like if you do Face Book
Great, tip jar exists on my DIY Plumbing Advice >com site... pay pal....  we love your comments too,  thanks for watching..
Rip ir out of the way with a small saw..
I have the same problem. Just tried to replace the cartridge, but the thin wall adapter used with fiberglas tub surround prevents me from pulling the clip.
Tip jar on diy plumbing advice .com is paypal visa etc.....  we live on tips, and thank you like you comments like have posted.  Thanks for watching and your comment.  Win...Winnn    Greg
Great video!  However, I ran into a problem. How am I supposed to remove the clip when it's encased in a white plastic housing?  I have a picture but I guess I can't post on here...
Rotate the cartridge, pull the clip.   the center stem is also rotatable...
I had this same problem with my previous house which I hired a plumber to fix and $319.00 later, it was fixed.As soon as my guest bath in my current house only had hot water, I knew right away it was the same problem. Bought the removal tool $12.00 and cartridge $42.00 and with the help of your video, my guest bath is ready for my family to stay for Thanksgiving. Oh and we corrected the problem with the water temps being backwards! Your a life saver!! Happy Holidays.
Is that pronounced with a silent J ?
Thyhyyyhhjj
Well my my Plumber friends won't like that, but that is what this is about, If you feel you can do a good job, then it is your best interest to do for your self.  The risk is having the center of the cart. pull out...  then the tool will pull that out.
thanks!  I was going to get a plumber until I saw your video and replaced  it myself. you saved me some money.
There are situations where $500. would be a good price. for a factory Magnum 1225 installed.  Parts labor tax and the other issues.
Regionally it varies,  Travel and wage costs vary as does cost of living. NY City where it could require parking permits and a distance to travel to get tools into a building .. $300. would be a good price in a city.  If it is a building where water shut off notice is needed 24 or 72 hrs in advance that could cost extra.   in a low cost area and the "Plumber" is a trainee is training for his first 4 yrs. w/o hassles and other issues required to deliver a safe job, $150 would be a very good deal
In my house I am the handy man and do everything possible. I liked your video. How much a plumber would charge?
4:21 That is exactly how our shower knob looks right now. Even with the heat limiter off we still get no hot water. After seeing this video i'm gonna try to see if there's any debris behind all of it. I hope all goes well, thanks again Greg!
With out viewers, it is only the dream I had in 97', thanks for watching....subscribe, more are videos are coming, subscriptions free, and no one sees our mailing list but the webmaster Bill.  We just want to get feed back on what to make videos on and what we can do better.   Greg
Thank you for an awesome video
Water mains get debris in them from breakages is pipes.  These pieces get into plumbing fixtures everyday.   No, I o not drink the tap water, I have a point of use treatment RO at my kitchen sink...  It is not the sticks and debris I am concerned about, it is the Pharmaceuticals and other stuff neither nature nor water treatment plants remove.    Look into hormones and things in water causing medical conditions in people nationwide.
Check for "sticks and twigs"? Hope you're not drinking the water if it has this problem.
No sound?  worked for me a min ago, You Tube seems stable there....  call me if you need help on plumbing, I have a voice!  760-788-2889
This is one situation where DIY is bad thing, in hindsight.  I must warn you it gets tough from here.  Call a pro.    Your cartridge needs extracting with skill and some tools. The body of the valve can be damaged when doing this causing the need for whole thing to be replaced.
Compared to tile done to the lowered standards of today? no.    Compared to tile done correctly on a real base and a mopped pan and the way tile was done 50 yrs. ago, yes, this is cheaper.  I am not sure one can find real quality tile anymore anyway. I am sure one can pay more for it.  Tile has grout, grout needs sealing, people do not do that.  Cultured marble is smooth, clean and easy to clean.  As with anything it needs correct installation, but easier to find a good install.
thanks alot for the reply is that cheaper than tiles
That is not tile it is cultured marble. Fake marble, made in a mould, in a factory custom to fit the enclosure for the builder.  Only seams are vertical in corners and at the base where the floor/pan is one piece as well moulded with a lip to receive the side panels of cultured marble.  it is about 1/2" thick.      Greg.
anybody know what type of tiles is on the tub sorround
Great, thanks for the post. I did say some pullers are around $100.  but I recommend the eBay suggestion as well.
Cartridges (genuine Moen) and pullers are available on eBay for about $20 each.
Weekly go in and turn the valve on and run in mixed position and alternate hot/cold  on & off to cause balance spool to actuate and exercise.  This also puts water seal in p trap to replace evaporated water in trap to prevent sewer gas from venting into room as well.
We will be doing this to a shower that had the hot water stop working.  We have hard water don't use this shower often.  What would you recommend so it doesn't do this again?  Should we make a point to use it and how often would you recommend?  thanks so much for the videos!
Use a sharp Awl tool to get clip out.  any of the pullers will work  I would use the Pasco brand L shaped one because it is cheap and easy.  Also has ability to retrieve body of cart if stem separates and pulls out of cart.
My cartridge clip is old and has a smaller tab and no hole.  It's also a little recessed behind the face of tile.  Which tool do you suggest I use?
Good question, I try not to put too much info. in video, but the H/C on top is used when the pipes attached to valve body is Hot on left and Cold on right...  Moen allows to pipe the valve backwords and just rotate the cart. to compensate.   If yours is reversed, you might have another valve back to back and it is easier to pipe them "wrong" on one side.    Thank you for the understanding on my pricing, I dont want to say low then have the price higher ....that is worse.
Silicone it is ans sorry for not mentioning it, yes great stuff use it...
There is a little pack of what looks like silicone. Is that to seal something or is it oil product to lube the rubber gasket when you stick it back together. Did not see you use any. Thanks, Albert
I need to be easy to understand, Plumbing can be scary.  Problems can get worse if not dealt with correctly.  But done right, many Plumbing repairs are ok for a homeowner who feels compelled and willing to think ahead.      Thank you for watching, tell friends subscribe, share, make the world a better place one Drop at a time....    Greg
Thanks now I can fix mine...Looked at several videos. Yours is easiest to understand...
Great, tell friends,  I do have a tip-jar on my diy site for assistance in putting more videos out to the public for free!  let's make the world a better place one drip at a time..    Greg
Thanks for this video, you saved me a ton of money fixing my shower.  All it took was some knowledge and $50 in parts.
Check your in and out nipples on the water heater.  Die electric unions corrode up choking the flow to the hot side,  If no where else has this issue, pull the trim plate and se if the valve body has built in stops and screen, if so clean and check.. Not fixed yet, get a new cartridge OEM only and pull existing one, when cartridge is out of valve body turn on water to flush out debris.  Re install new cartridge and wa, la, your fixed.
Good vid Excellent photography. I'm hoping my local guy will lend me puller if needed. Handle at 6 oclock when off, no binds or anything, and cold water seems to have same pressure as always. But when I go past 12 oclock into hot, the pressure reduces dramatically. We've had slab movement in the past, but i'm hoping it's a valve or debris. This seemed to happen suddenly, not over a period of time, which leaves me to believe it's not slab movement. Any feedback would be appreciated.
Yes new OEM Cartridge and flush out Valve body.
Stuck spool, debris in the Cartridge inside the valve.  Use only For Moen, by Moen.
Eric,  great that is what it is all about.  Unless you need a Plumber for something, then that is what that is all about.   Glad I could help.
I don't know if anyone else had this problem. If the homes' main water valve was fully open, absolutely no water would flow out. It took a while of trouble shooting to realize the problem. Called Moen and talked to personnel at the DIY stores, and no one could tell me why the brand new valve would not not work. Other than that, replacing the old valve was relatively easy.
Thank you for uploading the video. I had one shower that had only hot water so the showers were scalding at times. I had another shower that constantly dripped. I went to Home Depot and Lowes. At both stores the Moen OEM replacement cartidge was $39.95. Lowes doesn't carry the removal tool in store anymore but I found it at Home Depot for $12.95. I had both showers fixed in under an hour. Thanks again for the video.
Thanks, yea I try to respond properly to people who misunderstand my message (world peace by example and sharing).
Great video.  Ignore the haters.  You showed me how to do this myself and I thank you.
I had a friend replace my cartridge and now the handle is upside down. How can I get it in the right position? Please help. Thank you
The Tool is a better way, I do not advise "cheating"  if you are already not calling a Professional Plumber you are lucky to get by with buying a tool.  Stores sell them as low as $25 dollars.   I have paid $90 for an "Ona Tool" special design for when someone pulls out the center of a cartridge.   Ona Tool is a rescue tool.  I have rescued too many, that is why I recommend not cheating.
Great video thank you for posting. Q: Live in an apartment building & there is not a main turn off in apt. The whole building water needs to be turned off. I heard that there are sometimes adjustment valves behind the shower faucet plate that you can use to turn off the water instead of turning off the main. I haven't found any videos that covers this specifically but was wondering how you can tell if there's valves? and are the valves screws or another type of adjuster? thank you for your time.
I will ask my web partner to post a correction that you can get China made stuff cheaper.  OEM Parts by moen for moen Posi temp cartridge is $75. retail if you can find it at a mega store that is selling us down the river.  As far as "Plumbers go, they have to deal with "Consumers that are focused on the cheapest thing at the price of losing American pride.  Take a picture of that cheap stuff you claim to get and show me the USA made stamp.  I guess you are not concerned about Jobs here.
If you want the full set of USA made pullers not made in China, and different ones it costs more.   Stop for a min. and think,  I am not your enemy,  give me a break, I am trying to help on my own nickel.
I am sorry you are correct about the prices, they were that high yrs. ago.   I am not blowing anything anywhere, all this is free.  I sell nothing.  I spend hrs. every day helping the public that will never meet or be hired from.  I need to adjust that amount but it costs time and money to do there videos and re doing is maintenance...  What could I possible gain by lying about the price, I do tell everyone to DIY, I am not paid by anyone to be outdated on my prices. I priced the more expensive.
glad We could help.
Thx this video helped my Plummer had the hot/cold I had to put it upside down so it works right thx again D.
Maybe you could make a video of that too in the future! It would have helped me big time! ....Jeannie  ;-)
okay, thank you very much for your quick reply. I really appreciate it. :)
Call a pro who know how to do that.  look at some of my other comments and people who have had that problem.  It is tough.  I don't suggest even some Plumbers have the skills to extract that.  I have done many, but not easy to convey how on text.
I wanted to ask you...my moen handle just broke off when I tried to turn the shower on.  And now, I can see that the valve stem broke off with the handle! :(  Since there is no more stem that I can pull on to take the cartridge out, what can I do?
Yes Grohe makes a great valve that the flow is adjusted with one handle and temp is another and the temp is thermostatic.  Thermostatic valves have temperatures on the nob.    The temp is controlled by a fast reacting coil in the valve body.  These valves are not home ctr. priced China made crap.  They cost more.  Roman Tub fillers have 3/4" ports and can flow 10 gal. per min.   Real Brass and Stainless steel parts!
Yes, that's the one that the copper re-pipe guys installed in my shower, and I'm not happy with the inability to adjust the flow rate.  Is there a code-compliant model that does allow you to adjust the flow rate?  Thanks.
If you are referring to the PosiTemp Moen, that is a double valve  having pressure balance feature that is required by now code.
Seems like a complicated, tricky, and pitfall-laden process for a valve that doesn't even allow you to adjust the flow rate.  The Delta unit featured in your other video seems all-around better.  Would you agree?  Thanks.
Life is good,  if you are ever in need of more see my DIY site again also a tip jar exists
Excellebt, went to Lowes and got the part. Took about 5 minutes. I found that if you spay some penetrating oil, like wd 40 around the valve and then rock it using the tol with the replacement part it comes loose faster.
What you mean to say is the brass body around the Cartridge has stuck into the valve body and the stem from in the cartridge came out...   They make a tool for that extraction.   One is called an Ona Tool  $100,  the other is a Pasco tool $20.   Skill is needed to use them.  You might need a Plumber Professional....
I've had a problem occur. The brass casing around the valve has separated from the valve, so that the valve stem has come out, but the brass casing has remained in the copper pipe. It seems locked by hard water deposits. I've tried everything I can think of to extricate it, but to no avail. Any ideas?
The cap can be tough, a sharp knife...
Just did it using the cartoon that came with the stem.  The hardest part was getting the damn handle-cap off!!
Love your name too.
Depends on what valve you have,  sounds like an older one.   I need manufacture and age.  photo?  and send?
Tell your friends or look at my other viders to save future troubles.  I have pro active stuff too..
With my compliments!
You are the very reason I do these videos.  Thanks for watching and your replies.  An E book is being written on DIY Plumbing and this thread may go in it.       Greg.
I never regret having attempted the repair myself....well almost never. Mine as well do you homework and try. Don't get me wrong, I'm just smart enough to know when to call in bigger guns. I also got a great father in law who is a tremendous teacher and help. We both watched and appreciated this vid for insight...right after we broke off that nub. Thanks and cheers!
I have done the drill method my self..  Kinda scary Plumbing task uh.  Congratulations on your success .  Do you regret having attempted the repair yourself?
Thanks for replying, the tip, and the video itself! It was very helpful. We finally got it using a drill Once the old cartridge started to turn a bit after the bit got into it, it came out. Thanks again very good vid.
Did the whole center pull out?  If so no big deal, get a pasco tool and do the rest with it...
DAMN'T I broke my old sleeve threaded end to pull on.
Any plastic around the brass valve body has writing on it that says Tile guard it is to be removed.  If it is holding  fiberglass in place and the valve firm that is still needed to do so.  but cut away the plastic and replace the clip that holds the cart in...
Tell a friend, I am looking for lots of takers, on my free web support.
I think it is discontinued as of couple yrs. ago.  Find one used on craigs list.
Where can I buy big posi-temp pull tool? I brought one from Low's and it does not work.
A puller is best, but all is well that ends well.  You risked breaking off the stem in the wall and then you would have had to pay extra to a Professional....   Congratulations, on your skill, I realize it was no easy task to pull off with success.
i did it i fixed my own shit that damn cartridge was stuck though hammer and a pair of vice grips and i got it thanks
Moen Temptrol uses a Magnum Cartridge and a separate Stainless Steel Balancing Spool.  your Spool is stuck.  Probably either debris, or not been used for a while.  This spool is behind the 7" round trim plate and has a slot for a screwdriver a round cap size of a quarter and a slot across it .  remove and replace or free it up in a cup of vinegar .
have you heard of a valve called "temptrol"?  Know of this defective valve? It provides NO cold water.
Thanks, yes Plumbing repairs is a tricky task.  I rightfully warn DIY'ers.  Some might think I minimize the seriousness of these repairs suggesting anyone try this...as you know this is not for everyone except skilled and lucky.  I have been both on the same job.
Greg, you're the man & you seem like a heck of a nice guy. Great video & well-explained. I was in a difficult situation because the brass stem from the cartridge was broken off. So Moen plastic removal tool wouldn't work nor would a puller. Tried to pull it but the stem only came out w/ outer shell still in the valve. Had to break/drill it out & I don't recommend this but I got lucky & valve doesn't leak even though I scored it a bit with the drill bit & a flat head. But the video still helped!
I am glad you are aware enough to know to do this.  Some Plumbers think that I do these videos to cheat them or to under value a pro.  You are proof I am not a trader to the trades!  Some might think it involves just this or that, as you see it is involved and very specific to avoid a flood or water damage.  Thank you very much for your viewing and judgement.  Greg Chick,  "Can you do it?, sometimes not, and I can help you know in advance"...
I think I'll call a plumber...:)
I'm good, thanks!
Thanks for the reply, what are your other Plumbing needs?  any?
I've never done anything like this before and it was pretty straightforward for me.  Thanks for the video!
@spitvace I have full support for your position.  My comments show that I give you no argument.  I even agree.  Viewer beware, your plumbing is extremely important, Contractors such as Spitvace are not very sympathetic.  So pay attention or pay the plumber.....
@ramonasplumber Yup.  And, you can run across the highway with your eyes closed - perhaps even a few times but sooner or later...  Not knocking your video - it's quite good actually.    But as a plumbing contractor and licensed master plumber, I stand by by assessment of this procedure.  It's simply advice.  Do with it what you will.  If I have to leave my home and family on Saturday night due to a self induced emergency that didn't have to happen, none of us are going to like it.
@spitvace If you look at how many people who have had very happy experience with my video, you can see some ca.  I do have several warnings all over my site suggesting a pro is sometimes the best call.   My hope is to decrease errors from what failures I too have seen.   The Delta valve twist off warning is another.  I actually had one guy call me even after I warned him about the twisting of the valve body.  I sent him to another Plumber so I would not make money on this error.
@ramonasplumber As a plumber, numerous times I've had to bail people out of failed PosiTemp and Moentrol cartridge replacements. While at first glance, cartridge replacement would appear to be a simple task but things can and do go wrong - and not just for people that aren't "handy".  There are some plumbing tasks around the house that are well suited to the do-it-yourselfer and home handyman - this is not one of them.  I have never charged a customer for a Moen cartridge.
@spitvace    Everyone Please pay attention to Spits advice,  He is very right, and you will be in a very compromised place with a Professional Plumber that will not be as understanding as me.  I would guess if you were to ruin the valve body and it need replacing you will be in the hole $600 at min.  unless you are on a holiday at night and no local nice guy is around I have known of well over $1500.     Seriously.....Greg Chick
Do this yourself and make a mistake - you won't be putting your water back on...
@ramonasplumber Good price.   Have you checked your Water Pressure?  I think you have trouble brewing.   You need a Pressure gauge and test at a hosebib with no water running for an hr. and also know what is incoming water pressure to the Regulator
@fotobymike    Ferguson Wholesale Plumbing Supply has the OEM 1222 for $49.00   are you sure you bought OEM?  that is cheapest I ever heard of.

Thanks!  You just saved me a call to the plumber.
@flagface4 Few will DIY, fewer will learn first.  As a Plbr. I have seen what those who will DIY can do to make something bad, even worse!  I hope to tell them do it right or call a pro.   If I can get the fantasy out of peoples minds that Plumbing is easy I will be happy.  Sometimes it is, but one needs to be aware of the pit falls.  "Oh I had no idea" is a common response I get from DIY'ers that screwed it up.  Now it costs a lot more!  you know the twisted off Delta valve trick!
@romonasplumber As a plumber in florida I can and will say good job. You made this simple for a home owner. And you can save home owners some money! I work for myself and when I get calls for this I wonder why they haven't looked for this on Youtube. Good work!

@threegoofs You are so current, yes @25 to 50 max.  I should change the text.  The serious "Ona Puller"  is about $100, but it is a commercial product.
Awesome video.  Great stuff.    Dont worry about he length - better too long than too short.  Note, though.. cartridge pullers dont cost $100.  That alone would scare me off of doing this at all.

@queeniejo100 There are different models of Moen Valves.  The Trim comes in too many versions for me to say, but which screw is the problem?  you must have a lever handle posi temp valve.  go on line to Moen.com and you will be able to identify your unit.   I always like the simple clear plastic knob.  one screw in center and that is phillips. most Moen is made in China now so could be metric.
@l31007     Thank you,  I am getting better with my presentations.  Saying too much makes my videos too long,  saying too little causes possible grief....  We are thinking of adding text notes of some possible glitches,  would you have read them?
Wonderful tutorial. Excellent job of explaining everything. I love how you mention problems that we might run into and how to address them. Nice video work too. Thanks so much for this!

Flip will work
@ramonasplumber Thank you for the reply.  I bought the house about 4 months ago and it has been that way since moving in.  I am currently doing a remodel of the bathroom and the only thing that I am not changing is the shower/tub, but I want to fix things.  I would rather the faucet be a Delta because I love their MultiChoice valve that is so easy to work with, but that would be extensive work cutting out the wall from the adjacent room.  I will try to flip the Moen valve and go from there.
@JCMelton22  How long has it been like that?  Yes that would do that, rotate the cartrige not just the stem.
continued... My valve is apparently an older version since it does not have the H and C markings.  However, could having this valve in up side down with all other things set correctly be my problem with still getting hot water when first turning on the handle?  Would flipping the valve resolve this problem?
Great video!!  I have one of these Moen Posi-temp shower/tub faucets. However, my faucet does turn on hot first and progresses to cold as your turn the handle counter-clockwise. I have tried to rotate the center stem 180 degrees as stated, but water keeps running and it does not correct the problem.  I noticed you said that the valve could be place in up side down depending on the plumbing connections. My plumbing is does have hot coming in on the left and cold on the right. My valve is apparen
@Skipigeon    A good deal is timeless, anytime,      Greg
Thank you for posting this.  We needed the savings this time of year.
@alexd509    Thank you,  I look to do just that!,  easy and helpful.   Greg
to ramonasplumber   thank-you for uploading such a helpful video, it is greatly appreciated and nice to see someone willing to help others with their plumbing issues.i'm currently having issues and i found this video educating and easy to follow.  :-)
@lillymust10 Is it a Moen?  is it original with the house,  Have you removed the handle?  can you take a picture and send?
Hi i have a single-handle tub that is leaking however the handle turn all the way up to the rigth or left, on the right side at the top says hot and on the right side at the bottom says cold and on the middle of te bottom says off but if i keep turning the hadle  to the left after the off sing it keeps turning until get on the middle of the bottom and that's when stop to turn but ither way the water came out and when i set the handle on the off sing is a small leak. Can you help me ??? Tks
@Aprillei1979 Yes the Positemp cart. has a part in it that gets stuck in one position and the cold or the hot are blocked out.  If you pull the cart and free up the inner stainless steel piston your good to go, but might as well buy a new one and have an extra if you can free up the old one.
My faucet only runs HOT, no cold.  Its exactly like the one in your video.  What do I need to do?  Will replacing the cartridge fix my problem?  Thanks!
Thanks for the post on the tool cost and location,  good luck all you DIY'ers.   Greg Chick
@ramonasplumber : Hi Greg, should the water be shut off to rotate the cart post? I have the same exact problem and trying to figure out whether to turn the post with pliers as shown or remove and reinstall the cartridge (upside down). Thanks!
Dude, I put it in upside down dang it!!! But thanks so much for this video!!! It helped tremendously!!!
I followed the instructions in the video.  Everything works great, no leaks until I turn the water on and then back off.  Then the faucet leaks like crazy and I have to bust the pliers out to get it to turn all the way off.   Suggestions?
@wfpalmer 0:06 is where I lose the sound.
@Chris9017 Sound checks OK on my computer. Was it at a particular point that you lost the sound? (Video guy for Ramona's Plumber)
Hey no sound, what's up with that?
Great, you can always go to my tip jar on my diyplumbingadvice. site and help support my free advice!     Plumber Greg,  and Webmaster Bill.
This was great..i got the cartridge for $35 at my local big box and the specialty tool was only $15 (plastic version but it didn't work) but i didn't need it. This video saved me $100!
This video helped me get the job done.  Thanks!  Shopping at Home Depot, my cost was $22.00 for a new cartridge, $12.97 for the puller, and $2.36 for plumbers grease.
Thanks SO MUCH!!! :)
@rhodesmk    Remove handle and rotate the cart post.
Fabulous video!  I would have royally bit it without the tips you had here -- saved me a boatload of plumbing bills...!
Thanks for this informative video. Keep up the good work. We as a home owner that only know so much really appreciate it. Helps me a lot to tackle this project.  Thanks.
Before changing the cartridge, mine worked like yours (all the way right is off, all the way left is hot, in between is cooler to cold as you go right). After putting a MOEN 1222 in, suddenly off is straight up, right is hot, left is cold, and I get no mix to get warm. What did I do wrong?  Thanks!
Excellent Video!!!!!!!!! I had a problem with not having hot water for the shower. My local home improvement store recommended replacing the cartridge. I found your video and your instructions were outstanding. I took your advice and bought the posi-temp puller. I'm glad I did because the cartridge was very difficult to remove without it. I finished the job and now I have hot and cold water running in my shower. Thanks for saving me the expensive cost of using a plumber.
I need to only replace the Escutcheon.  It looks exactly like the one on the video.  The screw holes are located on the 2 & 7 O'clock position.  What I need is the model number for the Moen Escutcheon.  Could you advise as to the model number.  I would really appreciate it.  Thanks and great video on the removal and replacement of the valve.
Thanks a lot for this, just did it myself.
@tony10376 They're thieves everywhere!
@bigb1232002    Great, way to go.
Great video.  I went to Home Depot to find a replacement cartridge but only found complete sets.  While still in the store, I pulled the Moen phone # off the box, gave a description of my issue/shower hardware and within 3 min had completed the order for a FREE replacement cartridge.  With the help of this  video and the new cartridge, I expect the installation to be straightforward.  Jennifer at Moen customer service was great and they made me a big fan.
I bought the puller tool at Lowe's for $14.95. The cartridge is $19.95 for the OEM at Lowes. This, including tool,., gasoline to and from Lowe's, cartridge, and silicone grease was under $40. The one time I had a plumber do the work it was a $75 trip fee, $50 for the cartridge, and $45 labor. No way I will ever pay a plumber to do ANY work...the ones in Austin, TX are thieves.

I have no plumbing experience, I followed his instructions....did a little research on the Moen web site (I had no clue which cartridge to use) and 30 minutes later, I was done.  ensure you purchase the puller, it was a life saver!!! Great video!!! Thanx!!!
@19nowayjose81    DIY is better with some tools and a video, watch them all and be proactive
Moen will send you free parts.....you do not need to purchase them.   They are awesome
