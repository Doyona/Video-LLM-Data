Love this bathroom! I could live in it for the rest of my life lol!
love how she mixes old and new, so lovely
... seamless flooring❤❤❤
Very nice🥰  Love the continuous flooring❤
The bathroom is just as beautiful as the designer herself!♥️ Absolutely love the vibe she went for... Just stunning!👌 Family friendly, easy and enjoyable. Not the kind that you'll be scared to step into so you don't ruin anything😉
Does house and home have any problem with colours and patterns?
That shower with no lip is great for aging. Good resale feature
Good Grief, this bath is AUHmazing.  I Love that it’s NOT overdone, everything correlates so perfectly!!!
Thanks for sharing
Love the BRASS
Hate the brass fixtures.
don't like it overall and it's gonna be flooded.

LOVE the vibe of this bathroom - gorgeous!!
No toilet? 😱
This bathroom is gorgeous! I love how the shower seems to float in space. Good job!
Where is the toilet?🚽
Is brass back in style? I am seeing it everywhere! I just got rid of my brass knobs and was planning to get rid of the brass trim around my shower door because it looked dated.
SO SO pretty, except I think there's a little too much brass...
I really enjoyed this video. That was an amaizing bathroom. Gorgeous, just gorgeous!
Absolutely stunning, I would love to have that in my house!
