Beautiful soul, came back here today to make this blanket again 6 years later ❤

When I started to learn crochet I found your page. I made this blanket for my baby. I've made this blanket also as baby shower gifts. You also helped me learn how to make some cool sewing peojects.   I came back to this video to refresh my memory on how to make it as i am making it for a friends baby girl and learned that you had passed away. So incredibly tragic. You have touched so many lives and will continue to do so thru your page. I hope you are resting in peace ❤

She taught me so much, I really miss her. I’m making another blanket ( have made about 7) I just loved her tutorials ad listening to her instructions.

Thank you sweet angel 😇
I’m starting this blanket today, with Angel Melanie helping me.    Bless you forever 🙏🏽❤️‍🩹
This was my first blanket for my son who was born into heaven at 19 weeks. Thank you for sharing your gift. I hope Uilleam has found you in heaven.
She got this 70 yo grandma into crocheting.   Fly high dear angel.
For anyone doing this one..make your chains very loose -the result is better
Miss you Mel. This was the video that helped me yesrs ago🧶
I have watched your videos many times and made about 6 of these blankets in all sizes and colors, but I can’t believe you are gone 😢.
Miss your wonderfulness in the world. Love that you're still blessing us with your creativity even after you're gone.
Rest Well Mel❤ Forever Missed❤
How long do you do your baby blanket how long is it

I continue to share this video with friends wanting to learn the art of Crocheting! Melanie inspired so many! I will help to keep her memory ALIVE!
Ty... I'm not done, but I love it so much, already
Missing this kind gentle spirit.  Making this for a baby shower for the second or third time.  Its easy and makes a beautiful gift. Rest in heavenly peace Melanie.
Love your tutorials & patterns .... you are so missed ! R.I.P.
I’m so sad I didn’t know about your videos until after you left us😢
8:56 8:57
Sad beautiful story.   I have been having trouble with another pattern. Is it sturdy though?   She seems like a beautiful lady
As a crochet content creator myself I remember how you inspired me to start my own channel. Just watching this video makes me realize again what a great teacher you were.
I had no idea. How did I miss the sad news last year! This video is the reason I was finally successful at crocheting for the third time. Thank you for all you did Melanie. May you rest in peace. 😢
I’ll never stop watching your tutorials. Your legacy will live on and on.
It's not a V stitch. It's a diagonal double.
This is a beautiful blanket. I’ll make it for my niece who’s going to be born in January of next year.❤
Hi you what i can crochet very well only thing i dont have pattern so am picking up well ok
😢i did know you went to sleep just put you on so could refresh my mind ❤❤
Thank you Melanie for teaching me how to crochet this baby blanket for my baby 5 yrs ago...I never thought I'd come back to it again to discover that you've gone to Heaven. Your crochet lessons were a big part of my healing through my cancer journey. I thank you from the bottom of my heart 🤍 I will thank you personally when I see you in Heaven 🤍
I have used this tutorial and have crocheted so many baby blankets for my small group ladies and coworkers for their baby showers , thank you for your legacy Melanie 🙏🏼
Thank you Melanie. God bless to your kids and you're in a better place
Sorry to hear of her passing. Continue to rest in peace 🙏🙏🙏
God I miss her so much 😢 😭 ❤
We all miss you♥️♥️♥️  Rest In Peace… Melanie!♥️
This will be the second time I’m making Melanie’s blanket. I made her beanie 4 times last week as it’s very cold now, down under 🇦🇺. I keep coming back to these tutorials just to hear her beautiful voice 😢💖💖💖
Can i use #5 chunky yarn and a 5 hook
what a lovely wowan , it touched me changed me watching her story xx
I have a question this blanket looks really big but when I do the chain 42 it’s now that big as the finished blanket 2:22
I just now read the comments below, I am so very, very sorry to learn of her passing. My deepest and sincerest condolences to the family. Thank you for the wonderful tutorial! This is what I wrote before. I'll keep it here to show the family how very much I appreciate her wonderful talents! .... It is rare to find a presenter who teaches in just the right speed and has a pleasant and happy voice!  Your video taught me how to make my first real blanket - everything else until now was a yarny mess! Thank you!
😢😢
It's still so hard to believe our beautiful crochet mentor is an angel now. Rest in peace and rise in glory 🙏🙏🙏
Thank you you make it so esy to follow to learn
Great design! Great style!! I miss you Melanie!!!
Oh sweet Melanie your videos taught me how to crochet a long time ago . I came back to make a baby blank for my new great nephew and will use your tutorial . I will cherish your videos . May you rest in peace with no more sickness sweet lady 😭❤️
What is the about box I don't see it. I really want to make this blanket.
This is the tutorial I used to make my first and only, baby her very own blanket 7 yrs ago. Her blanket is even more special now. Rest in peace Melanie ❤️💔
I made this for so many baby gifts. So sorry so sorry and  💔 broken. Blessing and strength to family..
Did she pass away. When?  So sorry 😔
Very  very  nice
Thank you beautiful person.
How big will this be when it is done? It won't be too big for a 3to 4month old baby will it? I was just wondering because I had planned to make one for a car seat or one for a stroller.  Can you please let me know? I love your tutorials and your bubbly personality!!
Using this tutorial again for at least the 10th or so time. Melanie is such a blessing for so many of us.  She certainly is missed.
Thanks for make the tutorials for begeners You make my life easier
This is the first video I watched of yours, Melanie. You made it so easy to learn. And you gave me so much knowledge to help me control my anxiety with it, while making beautiful things. You will be so missed. I’m sure you’re up there making cute hats for the angels. 💜🙏🏼
RIH
This tutorial was what got me started on crocheting.  I will be forever grateful for finding this project.  You enabled me to make baby blankets for my grandchildren, friends and many others!  The crochet world misses you so very much.  May you rest in peace.  And my hope for your beautiful family is that you watch over them and guide them with your love.
Love this 💘
I miss you Melanie! 🙏
Oh sweet Melanie, you are so missed.. and my favorite influencer! Lol..just ordered that hook. Loved you so much
How many rows did y’all end up making yours? I love the pattern by the way!
This is the video that made me fall in love with crochet and actually pick up a hook. Melanie had such a gift for not only teaching people how to do all of her beautiful crafts, but she also made everything so fun and doable.  Her upbeat personality and encouragement shone through the screen and made even a complete beginner feel like they could accomplish anything. I'm completely gutted to find out she has passed away. Sending all my love to her beautiful family and loved ones <3
I learned to crochet using trhis tutorial Thank you so much. May your memory be eternal, and rest peacefully and reassure you"ll be missed and remembered by many. I hope you are creating beautiful blankets in heaven.
You are sooo missed 🥲 So thoughtful so kind so smart so Beautiful . A Beautiful Angel now to watch over your family 🥰🙏🏼Rest in Peace Melanie 💕
I really want to try this! Thank you that you did these videos and I'm so sorry for your family's loss. 😢
Every time Melanie pops up on my page I just cannot believe she has left us ,looking at her listening to her vibrancy and then her final health stages it is just awful ..RIP Melanie
Aww I didn’t know she taught me how to crochet
My heart is broken. I love to crochet. My mom taught me so very much, but Melanie helped me go further. RIP.
She does about 8 rows if anyone wants to know at the beginning
Still teaching me to crochet. Thank you
Are the later comments saying Melanie passed away? If so, when did it happen?
I've been watching her videos for a long time now, she is the sweetest young lady ever, I can't keep from tears rolling down my face every now and then.... Melanie thanks for all your hard work may you rest in peace.. God Bless
💗
Just saw your face as I was scrolling and it made me smile. Rest easy lovely lady xx
R.I.P 🌹🌹🌹
Can I use Lion brand hometown super bulky yarn for this project
💔still can’t believe she’s gone.
Thinking about Melanie as I’m crocheting this beautiful blanket that she taught me years ago. Continued prayers for Melanie’s lovely family🙏💕
Miss your smile. RIP..  Not forgotten.
We all miss her
I MISS YOU. ☹️ 😢 😔 😭
Were the boarder  of the blankets
Oh my gosh, I just came back to find this pattern (I used it to learn from) and am so shocked. Rest in peace
Rewatching this before I make a blanket for my two (!!) Nephews, Mt friend, and my very own (first) child. I'm so thankful for your videos. Wherever you are, I hope you're no longer suffering and that your loved finds comfort in knowing how many lives you are still touching.
Thank you for keeping her memory and videos. She was the an amazing lady!
Rest In Peace 🙏 Love you forever 🌷🌸🌺
Not for beginners and far to fast
Just saw this pattern being used in a crochet group and I wanted to check it out.  What a wonderful surprise to find it is your pattern.  Your sweetness and talent live on!  Blessings:)  We miss you.
Love this.  Melanie was such a beautiful soul. ❤
I'm getting started on this blanket today for one of my unborn nieces and I have to say I'm so so so grateful for the years of work Melanie put into her channel! I dabbled in her videos before but I got the itch a month ago to pick up crochet again. I was heartbroken to see she had recently passed away and have been praying for her family. I watched one of her washcloth videos and made about 5 washcloths just from that. I used her baby bootie video to make 3 pairs of baby/kid slipper socks and because of learning from her tips and helpful techniques I am finally finishing a baby blanket I started over 10 years ago. Thank you, Melanie, for sharing your love of creating and teaching. May your memory be eternal with God. ❤
Could I use a thinner yarn for this pattern like a number 4 yarn
Thank you for teaching me how to crochet ❤ rest in peace beautiful angel
what is the size of this baby blanket??
Queen 💞
Thank you Melanie for all your tutorials,   May you rest in peace beautiful brave girl xxx
Thank you so much this has really helped a lot.
Wow almost 6 million views. Condolences to Melanie’s family.  She was sweet lady.
Rest in peace, Beautiful.❤
All your projects are well explained and you are inspirational. Rest in Peace Melanie❤️
I just found her too. I will watch every video of this young lady. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I am so saddened to hear about Melanie passing.
This was the first blanket I made with Melanie . I loved how it came out . The little girl I made it for still loves it. I’m going to miss her for a long time . She was such a beautiful person and teacher. To her family , please allow me to express my deepest condolences at this time. Your in my thoughts and prayers.
I made this one!!  Thanks Mel 🤓
I can't believe that such a young and full of life person is no longer in this world 😢 rest in peace Melanie and thank you very much for everything 💔😢
Melanie taught me how to crochet this blanket for my first grandchild. I've my a few of these! ... I shall make another one tonight. God bless you. She makes me happy. I'm grateful to have attended the service. Thank you for inviting her subscribers. I'm still in tears. She's beautiful. May God hold you close.
R.I.P beautiful angel! My condolences to her family. 🙏
I was making this blanket and a quilt for my baby, who is due in less than 2 weeks, when I found out about Melanie's recent passing. It's so heartbreaking and my thoughts go out to her husband, children,  and family. I have followed these tutorials when making blankets for my sister when she was pregnant. It's thanks to Melanie that I started quilting and learned how to crochet, and so she has brought my life more peace, tranquility and happiness.  I'm sure she's touched so many lives in similar ways.
She's rest in peace 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
rip :( loved you sm
I made this blanket for my king size bed and I love it! Thank you Melanie. I will miss you. May you rest in peace 🙏♥️
This crochet design looks so amazing my friend. TFS. Stay connected 😊

This video was helpful for me as a beginner long time back, your name came in mind today and i found out that Melanie is no more, SHOCKED. I want give my condolences to the family and pray for lot of strength to all of them. May her soul rest in peace.
How is this for beginners, its so confusing

Your videos helped me get back into crocheting after a years long break. This was the first baby blanket I ever made. I always reference your videos for baby blankets. Thank you for all the wonderful patterns. Rest easy 💜
Your crochet videos are wonderful, and I have made several of your patterns. So very sorry to hear of your passing. May God bless your family and Melanie you are going to be greatly missed!
I loved making this blanket. Thank you for sharing your love of crafting with the world. I wish your family peace and comfort in their loss.
I made this for my rainbow baby. Thank you. May you rest in peace ❤️
You will be missed Melanie. RIP...
RIP🙏💔
This tutorial started my crochet life. This was my first throw. I will call it my Melanie throw from now on. Thank you for all you've shared and taught us, may u rest in peace.
May you rest in peace Melanie - your tutorials revived my passion for crochet. I have made this blanket so many times. You will be missed
This was the first blanket i made by her so sad to hear she passed away may her gentle soul rest in peace
In loving memory, you will always be in my heart. Lorna Hazelwood

Making this right now, it's turning out brilliant, thank you. Welcome to heaven, I am glad you found peace. May God comfort your family.
Rest In Peace, Melanie.
It's hard to tell where was it start in the other ones begin how to make it easier to tell the difference
Thanks for the video! Just finished my blanket. Very first crochet project. Your video was very easy to follow.
Mine doesn’t look like yours.  Not sure why.   I think i did it right.  But anyway.  Eventually I will try again.  Mine is for my first grand baby due April 10, 2022. So i may not Make it as big as your.  Not sure. Lol.
Good video so much love crochet
So confusing...How is this for beginners? Lol
Thank you!! Thank you!!
I entered my baby afghan in the Kay County Oklahoma Fair  using this pattern and received a 3rd place ribbon!
I would like to make a larger baby blanket. What formula should I use? How many foundation chains???
i have made this blanket multiple times for myself, family and friends. it’s so easy to follow and looks amazing
Can I use regular yarn??
You're the best!  I just made this and it's beautiful.
I love how you teach!  You make things sound so easy!
I got lost.... I'm gonna watch this whole video first since I'm already watching it. Then I'm going to find how to do the two main stitches and when I have the yarn and needle I'll be back to this video. Thank you for sharing! I have never crochet before. Like ever. And I want a blanket like this for my daughter so bad but they are expensive to buy.
Hi Melanie!0, thank you so much for sharing these beautiful videos.  I.am new to crochet and whenever I complete my foundation chain stitch the back sides  tend to *puff out.  I hope you understand what I'm describing🤣 Can you tell me how I can correct this problem? 🤔  Thank you again and have a wonderful weekend ~ take care! xoxo 💝🌷
Can someone please tell me what measures are supposed to fit a 1-2 year old I'm going to try crocheting tomorrow and i want to attempt this blanket for my baby cousin as my first serious project  but i don't really understand crochet measurements 😅
So glad I stumbled into this pattern.  I''m with Fiaoa, think I'll make this for myself to cuddle up in this winter.  Many Thanks for a great pattern and video.
You are beautiful girl
Really love the pattern; I used it to donate blankets to a hospital :). An important tip for those trying it out is to make the first 42 chains in the beginning LOOSE so it can stretch when you start the blanket because that part was really tight compared to the blanket and it wasn’t looking good.
Love this pattern!! Going to try this for my next blanket pattern 😊 Thank you for sharing!
This video has helped so much!!  So beginner friendly. Gonna get more yarn later to finish lol.
Perfect tutorial, thank you! I’ve got a baby shower to go to in 2 weeks 😊
???
Crochê fio de malha ou grosso   mas nome ??
So excited to make this blanket!  I’d like to add a accent color border. Can you suggest how best to do it?
I JUST made this blanket, the steps were so easy to follow. LOVE IT! I love your videos.
I'm having a problem on the ends. Is she going into the front or back loop of top chain?
If I want to go wider how many chains should I make
I just finished this blanket. So pretty and easy.
you are the best teacher.  thanks!!!
This was great , I learned quick
Thank you for sharing this amazing easy project. I just made this baby blanket for my coworker's babyshower.
I’m having a problem when I make this that the side I start with is smaller than the other side (it is not a perfect square/rectangle where all/two sides are even). Anyone else have that issue? Any fixes or tips to fix it?
Can I sell the things I make using this pattern?
I absolutely love this pattern. It is easy and quick. I have made so many of these that I’ve given away over the years. Thank you.

I didn't have any of the thick yarn so I took and put three colors together and working with the same hook size and it is working up great. Thanks so much.
It's a pattern that the title says is for beginners... SLOW DOWN and show the chains and where you enter a bit better! Other than having to pause and rewind to see the movement better, was an easy pattern.
Hi Melanie! I'm making 2 of these for upcoming babies! What is the total number of rows for this exact blanket? Thanks
If you used a smaller yarn? Heart yarn and a 5 inch How many should I do?
I have made these blankets as gifts for my family and they love them ! Thank you for showing me how to crochet this beautiful blanket.
Thank you, sweet girl. This looks simple enough for me. I appreciate  this pattern!
I'VE  MADE 5 OF THIS BLANKET.  YELLOW, BABY GREEN ,(PINK,BLUE,WHITE,),( BLUE,GREEN,WHITE ) SEAFORM ALL BABY .
Wow!  This is awesome!!  Thank you so much!!!
Hi if I want to do it larger for an adult how many chains should I have?
Hi. How many rows do you suggest?
I recreated this blanket for my goddaughter and I love the final result.
Just wanted to reach out and tell you how much I appreciate this video. I made it for my niece when she was born over 3 years ago and right now I'm making it for my cousins daughter. This was the first blanket I've ever made to completion! When I have my own kids, I'll make one for them and I kind of want to make one for my own bed (maybe I could do a rainbow!) Anyways, thanks.
Nope,mine looked nothing like yours. Yikes!
I am a beginner at crocheting (started practicing October of this year) and thanks to your videos you have made the experience so great!  I’m currently using this tutorial to crochet a multi coloured blanket for myself using a 4mm crochet hook with Cygnet DK yarn (I may be here for some time 😂) and in between crocheting my blanket I have created one for our dog Milo using a 15mm hook and some super chunky yarn which I was able to finish within 2 hours.  I’m absolutely in love with crocheting and I will use the same pattern to create a scarves for my family members this Christmas. I appreciate the time you take to create these tutorials. Peace, blessings & good health to you. Thank you Melanie 🙂
How many rows did you do please
Does anyone know how many balls and how many to chain for an Afghan?
Oh my goodness I can’t tell you how many of these blankets I have made
thank you
Thanks
I made a giant gray one for myself. 😜
Hello! I know this an older video. Is there a written pattern for this?
I been working on this blanket since Saturday night and am almost done with it..thank you for your lovely video..BTW am a begginer and it was easy
I really like this and using a bigger needle. Going to buy one in the morning.
The only tutorial video I understood and followed along. Thank you so much for sharing this ❤
This is my go to pattern for baby blanket.  Really easy to follow, and I love it.  The only think I changed for my self was instead of dc I did hdc. I think it just looked a little more like tiny tulips. Thank you so much
You're going away to fast. This is supposed to be for a beginner?? You're acting as if though you're doing a refreshers course for someone who's experienced.
I have a suggestion, it would be helpful if you went a little slower  and maybe if you lay out the project on a flat surface like a table or something so that we can see better. Otherwise , great video.
I love this easy baby blanket pattern.  It just goes so fast and is so easy! I made it once as a baby blanket, then again 4x the size for my mom for Christmas last year, then my daughter (who is 8) wanted one and now I'm about to make several more for Christmas. Thanks so much for the tutorial!
Can I chain 42 + 42 to make blanket larger
Hi, how many stitches would I need to make this a little bigger? I don’t think I heard you say the variations of stitches for this pattern.
It would have been very useful for a description of how to cast off a little disappointing that you didn’t. Thankfully found a more thorough video and completed so wasn’t as frustrated.
Mine keeps flaring out as Im going.
THANK YOU
You are going way to fast for beginners..please slow down
What is the name of this beautiful pattern????
Melainie it went at fan out.It got bigger at the end why?
You. Make really easy
I thought you were supposed to chain 1 after your first double crochet. Then double crochet in that same stitch to get the v stitch.  All I see you doing is just double crochet twice instead of chaining 1 not that I have a problem with it or anything but I thought that you were supposed to chain 1 after your first double crochet for the v stitch.
I started with a sample size on this and a few rows in I already think I might just make this a scarf! This is the first time I didnt have to use stitch markers on a project, thank you!
Do you ever get like a curve when you crochet
I love this pattern! If I wanted to make a smaller version, could I start with a chain of 34? Or what would be a good starting number? And would I need to change anything else after that?
Would it work as well with a thicker yarn??
Crocheting a massive blanket is probably the only healthy impulse decision I've made during quarantine... now I just need to order the yarn and a hook and all will be cool!!
I plan to use regular 3 oz. Yarn & a K hook. How many single chochets for my chain?
I am making my granddaughter  A baby blanket and I 'm going to Use this pattern . Thank you
Definitely not for beginners. Second row made me wanna die.
I am ready to make one. I love this
Have you or do you think you could stripe this
Can you use this pattern for any type of yarn? Like can I use smaller yarn and still get the same finished product?
Hello from Ireland 😁Omg I love this video . i attempted crochet for the first time during lockdown here in April /May after 2 months of  trying and failing I gave up .  I decided to try again when I  came across your video only yesterday  and  my god it was so easy to follow and it all fell into place for me. I now have half a blanket completed In 2 days😁. Thank you thank you I am so happy I never thought I would get it 😁i wonder have you a basic video to do a border at the end of the blanket that I could  follow please x
Wow , that’s some thick yarn!
Hi ,I'm Algie new subscriber I enjoy watching you're video also wants to do the baby blanket for my incoming baby this year thanks for sharing videos ,I learned a lot of how to make blanket.
Im using Red Heart Super Saver is that ok for this pattern? I love the tutorial ❤😁
Can a border be added to this?
Excellent !  Love the pattern and the color.  It looks really soft.
thank yuou, so fast fo me a beginner....
So sad mine did not come out as pretty. My crochet skills are still too loose. But loved this!! Definitely going to keep trying!
Melanie! Thank you so much. I'm a beginner and slower learner. You taught me how to crochet. Yay!
As a beginner I feel I should let you know this was difficult to follow with how fast you’re going
Hi Melanie so happy I came across your video. Going to try an make it for my grandchild thank you
If you want to make it bigger how do you add more change in the beginning? Is it so many multiples and add so many ? Pretty blanket and color 💛
Made around 25 of these so far... and keep coming back cause I never write it down. Great video thanks👍
I changed it to 90 bc it was still to small of a blanket
I did 80 will that make a difference in the patter
I’m using red heart super saver yarn that’s all I could find in my area do to the covid19 pls help
Hi I’m a beginner, my new granddaughter is coming in 3 weeks so I need simple but pretty this is pretty, but 42 chains only is to small of a blanket can I increase the chains to another 42 pls??
Melanie, I love this blanket and your video! Great job! I have made a few of these baby blankets. How would I modify to make an adult throw? (Chain number, length, number of balls of yarn) Thanks for your help.
I love this easy blanket, ...you do a FANTASTIC job explaining everything, but forgive me, is perhaps your mic a little too good?....the sound of your swallowing got to me and I had to stop watching,....sorry...but I would want someone to tell me...
B
Made this using your tutorial and it turned out great! I can't wait to gift it my my friend having a baby girl this summer.
*Me using lots of diffrent tutorials, adding them together, and making a sweet strapples shirt*
Thank you for this pattern.  I have made numerous baby, child and adult blankets over the years.  I now finish them off with a nice border. 👌🏻. 😊
Nice it looks lovely colour
so sweet thanks for the video! makes quarantine more do able
This was my first crochet project ever - I made it into a queen size Afghan.  Thanks for the clear instructions - and for getting me started with such a fun, easy project.
I love you me and told me that you
thankyou for this it was so clear and easy to follow i love the blanket :)
Would love to add a border. Has anyone done that?
This is so nice and when you said this of beginner friendly you where right
If I wanna make a blanket about half the size should I do 21 instead of 42?
Can you lease go slower when you crochet?
Is there a way to print this pattern?
Watched the first minute of this and had to find another video to make a slip knot 😁
Help! I'm a bit confused... when counting stitches... a double crochet is counted as a stitch? So after a double crochet, the next stich is counted as stitch #2?? Not sure what's going on... but my edges are jacked!! #UGH
My little holes are bigger than yours.. should I be making this blanket tighter? I feel like when I do, it’s too tight.
You can use a 4ply and smaller hook to make this too
I am going to corchet one..it is so beautiful and the instructions were so easy. I love your tutorials.
I’m working on this Blanket right now and it’s so easy to do. I’m not a beginner and I enjoyed crocheting with you I will share a picture when it’s done. Thank you for sharing this project with us.
I really like this video I can't wait to start it but I'm afraid to do it bc the baby might get there hands stuck in it but will it be okay if the loops are big ?
I started by using a thinner wool and a smaller needle, but this is my first attempt at crochet! Thank you for your help x
I'm crochet blanket right now
I just finished this blanket last night for my great nephew. This is one of the easiest, yet beautiful patterns I've used so far. I'm still kind of new at this and very critical of my own work however, I'm impressed with my results. I absolutely love it. I used the Bernat baby blanket stripes in Sunshine. Your instructions made this project fun and easy and I was done in just a few hours. I will be using this pattern often. Thanks
Thank you so much for this video! It helped me complete my very first blanket for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it so much! You are a saint!
Can you use this pattern to do a king size blanket
I hate you.
Thank you so much for this video! This is my go to baby blanket, I'll make a crib size and then a stroller size fr the "baby".
Love this pattern and have made baby blankets and a large blanket for myself. I am struggling with how many chains to make to make a throw for a teenager. Has anyone made one? How large did you make it? Thank you for your help!!
Not every one will the same yarn. So , remember to tell how many rows. About 32  , if I counted right. Karen.
Started this blanket and I’m loving it so far :) got really soft wool and I said to myself would just love to keep this myself lol so soft but making it for someone I know who just had a baby girl 👧
This is not beginner friendly. I dont know how to start and you already had the slip knot tied then sped through the 42...whatever any of that means.
Help me you are going to fast for me. My hands are full of Arthur he bought. And I can't find pause. I am trying.
She is so good at giving instructions, I made 2 of them for my great grandchildren!
If I want to make thbaby afghan a little larger, how many chain stitches would I need to do to make it come out right (insted of the 42 on the pattern)?
Hi IAM new to this
Very nice
it so cute
Looks very simple not to many crazy stitches love it will be making this for my new grandson. Ty
The Bernat baby blanket yard instructions reads 8 mm crochet. What’s the difference between the 11.5 mm you suggested and the 8 mm size crochet? Thank you.
First try: My blanket turned into a triangle. lol it kept getting shorter and shorter. I am not giving up though. I will make this blanket lol. Thanks for the tutorial!
Your whining voice puts me off!
I bought that exact hook and NEVER thought I would have a need for it since I usually make amigurumi.
You go way to fast):
Thank you for this video! Just finished making my first ever blanket. It's a baby blanket for my niece. She is expected to arrive any day now. My brother's and his wife's first child! I'm so excited to gift this to them ♡ Next I want to make your ripple blanket. But first I have a few sewing projects to do!
Very helpful for me
I just found out that I'm going to be a 1st time NANA!! ❤❤❤❤ I am so overjoyed!! I really want to make something special for my grandbaby that they can keep forever, something with a special meaning that was made and given to them with love!! I don't have the faintest idea as to how to make a little newborn blanket, nor even how to begin!! BUT I am going to keep watching this video step by step until I get the newborn blanket MADE!!! ❤❤❤❤
this was a bit to fast for a beginner u didnt even show how to do the slip knot or how to start the chains. people's main issues are the double crochet and u flew thru it lol
hi Melanie, love this blanket I have already made 2 and working on third.  So thanks.  Quick question how about if I want to make this into adult throw.  Would I just chain like 84?  thanks...linda
I've finished the whole blanket but I can't figure out what size needle is used to weave that ends in
Too fast..could not distinguish what was the top chain in the turn.
Okay I did 42 changes and it only measure 23?  What's wrong? Please help
Love this
C

Nice👌👌👌👌👌👌
Where is about box ?
Had little notice I was going to meet my first grandson. This was perfect! Did I mention I had never tried to crochet before? Thanks!
Exactly what I was looking for!  Thank you!
I just put 42 stiches on and it looks so small.  Do I need to end with a even number if I want to make it bigger?
Very nice Work l love this
Ive done this on redheart yarn this yarn though makes me want it 😍
Could not find the about box
Its nice but too fast
This is a TERRIBLE video for beginners. So awful
Love this plan on starting my baby blanket this week
I keep getting confused as to which chain is the top chain, right before you do the last double crochet in the row. Are there any tips to help with this? Can I use stitch markers? Also are there any helpful tips on keeping the tension the same when you crochet? I'm new to crochet. I think the pattern is pretty easy. I just have some small hangups that I need help with.
I love crochet
How wide is this blanket it is 42 stitches, correct?  Is that big enough for a newborn baby blanket?
As a grandma-to-be, I am returning to crocheting after nearly 50 years!  I followed the directions but with thick yarn of merino wool (my daughter won't accept synthetics!!). However, the final width is only 20 inches even though I chained 42.  Did I do something wrong?  I'm afraid I have to tear it all apart and redo.  Please help!
just a small question.. is there any proper way to wash this kind of crochet blanket? I’m afraid to ruin them
This will be perfect for some baby yarn I have in my stash. I have yarn enough for at least two. I want to start now but it’s almost midnight. Dang.
.
Hi Melanie, How would you edge this, it’s great, love it. Gillian
I love crochet
Thank you so much get me started on crocheting again
Looks pretty simple! I don't normally crochet blankets with holes in them but my sister requested blankets like these for my 2 year old nieces. They have one now and love blankets that have gaps in them.
This got me into Crocheting. I will be forever grateful for this tutorial ❤️
I'm having trouble with the 3rd row, something just doesn't seem right. When I get to the end it don't look like on the video?
Love your tutorials!
Please let no question be a dumb question lmao. But after the first row is your goal to do 42 after that initial row, or is it just go into the v's and counting doesn't actually matter? Newby
I just can’t with the swallow sounds....👎🏻😷
Thanks Melanie for the clear instructions. Hope to do this blanket for my grandson.
How many chains did you do to crochet your baby blanket?
What size Crochet Hook is that?
2 balls of how much each? How many total oz. does this pattern call for?
I love this would you double it for a blanket or throw for grown ups x
I'm so happy I came across your videos! Even though I am a "beginner" I love how you get right to the point and flow with simple instructions. I've noticed with channels (and with no offense to their method at all) I get lost or distracted with the over-explaining. You create beautiful work, thanks for sharing it with us!
quantos novelos?
Poderia colocar a quantidade de tranças e pontos em português   Obrigada
Thank you so much Melanie! This is going to be the perfect stitch for my baby blanket that I’ve been looking for! Easy, lots of texture, and super soft!! Your tutorials are very good and helpful for me so an extra thank you! :)
You're going way too fast at the beginning
Will be doing one for myself after doing one for the baby 😂😂
How much DK (using 2 strands) of yarn do I need to get to follow this pattern for a light weight blanket in this stitch? I can't use a bulky yarn for the blankets purpose and Weather for my Grandbaby.?
Thank you, Melanie :) This is lovely. ♡ Have a blessed & splendid week. Xx
Do you think that a border would look good on this as a baby blanket? I’m thinking of how, maybe three double crochet like the granny Stich in every large space around the edge? Just trying to add a little extra to the baby blanket, done in baby blue, thinking a white edging??? Any ideas
I'm a beginner and I had to practice the single crochet for 2 days. I'm still practicing my tension. When I put the yarn in between the 2 loops, it starts getting tight. To all the beginners it does take time!!! You might get frustrated at first but don't give up. Once you start to get the hang of it. It starts to become very therapeutic!!!
You went wayyy to fast :(
Way to fast for beginners..
Made this blanket and it came beautiful!  Tried the shell stitch and can't seem to get it correctly 😮Thank You for all your videos👍👍
B
love the video your my queen xxxx sub to my youtube channel only my mom and brother has subbed
This pattern makes a lovely blanket!  I made one in seafoam green for my friend.  I expanded the pattern to make it an adult blanket and it is gorgeous!  She loves it!  Thank you for sharing!  I uploaded a picture to your facebook page!
This is really good! This helped me a lot because I am a slight beginner and all the other videos that I watched made me totally confused. Thank You so much for posting this!
After 3 attempts at other blankets on here,this was the only one I managed to do with straight edges! Thank you x
Love your video
This is an old video, but after watching it I've been having  trouble getting straight edges, I find it difficult to know which hole to actually go in when ending the row
Wish it was done slower... was really keen to learn but its just going too fast and im lost by 4min mark... video title is misleading :(
Should it have a boarder
LOVE this pattern!  I have a lightweight 3 yarn I want to make it in.... I always hear "make it your own", etc.  my baby blanket will be about 30 x 35  or 40 x 40, not sure yet.  Should I just go with it, measure out the chain and then just Go For it??
Where can I find the crochet baby blanket called easy breezy  tutorial, I don't know the ladies name it is pink and white self striping lion brand yarn.
I love your video but the swallowing in this video is driving me mad 😂 And I keep rewinding it to see what you did 😣😣
How is this for beginners you've not explained anything not even equipment.. ridiculous
Slower on the very end !!! Confused right at the end
Stopping by to show some luv. Stay connected
I've never used this yarn before.. is there any reason it would be harder to use than regular yarn?
If you use a smaller hook, does it use up more yarn?
I've started this blanket..and yes, it is easy for me. However, I am noticing that the beginning of the blanket(the first row) is turing outward(instead of laying straight). I started it over 3 times...and even went loser everytime. It is plenty lose enough..but, it is still puckering in the opposite direction. Any advice? Should my first row be a single crochet row..to allow for a good strong foundation??
I am definitely making this for myself, I’ll just triple the length 😂
Thank you
I just made this. It’s lovely. However are the spaces between the stitches too open? Like, would a baby get their hand tangled up in it?
Thanks for this video so helpful
I'm making my grandbaby a blanket, it's coming out great.
I made one of these about 4 years ago while I was pregnant im not super great at crochet but this video was so easy my blanket came out a little uneven but that was on me. I'm going to start making blankets and this is the video im useing!!!
I feel like you talk too fast.  You kept swallowing a lot which was very distracting.
Love love love this - but for myself 😁
Definitely not for beginners.
My friends mom just had a baby I’m trying to make something for him
Great tutorial!
Hi Melanie. Thank you for your tutorial. This is very easy... HOWEVER, I really pray you can help me. I'm actualky so sad. In the first row of making the fans, my blanket began to "bow". I had gotten up to three rows of the fans, but it bothered me so bad, that I took it all apart and started over. I tried very hard to make the fans tighter thinking that would help, but no. It didn't.  Help....?
Do you have to swallow right  into the mic
I’m bored and I got a big ball of yarn for my birthday so imma use that lmaooo
you went way to fast
2018?  Like if yes👍
You re a great teacher 👍👍👍👍👍
Wow, how ugly can a blanket get?  Please, people, stop using this horrible chunky yarn stuff.  The finished result looks horrific.  There are plenty of small projects for beginners to get experience.  Don't commit to a blanket until you are ready.  And when you are ready, do something that will actually look nice that you can be proud of.
Lmao BEGINNER!?!?
This blanket im making is going to be great with old style Christmas candy colors and soft velvet yarn for my youngest daughter.
Good video! One quick question. Why instead of going into the space of the chain you go into the middle of the chain? then after that you go into the space for the rest of the rows? Any reason for this?
way too fast for a beginner 😳
do you give lesons
If I wanted to make an adult couch throw size, how many stitches would I begin in my chain.
Thats gorgeous, going to try this as I need something without too much thought.
Can you use L/11-8.00MM? Will it still work? I Love you’re blanket, it’s beautiful and I want to do it.
Making one for my baby cousin 🙃
Hi, love your video so far😊 how long does it take u to make this blanket? Ive been making plastic canvas pieces for years n I've recently wanted to learn to crochet. It looks like fun!
Wow this didn't help me at all
The first blanket I completed! Took me 3 days “work and kids in between” it’s beautiful!!!
This is awesome and perfect for my skill level!!! Do you have any tutorials for a shrug or chunky/loose cardigan?
love this pattern you were great showing me how to create this blanket .... tks
I just Subscribed; you were mentioned in Crocht CJ's very first Podcast. Niiiiiiiiiiiice Blanket
It is very beautiful 🌹
You go WAY to fast for a beginner. Please make another beginners video and slow down.
Too fast
Is it necessary  to block the blanket after finishing?
My eyes got tangled lol
I just watched a guy trying to learn to do this on Facebook so I can here to learn something because it actually looks fun. I think I can do this! I need to buy all the stuff but I'm gonna try. I'll make a blanket for my nephew. Lol
Hello I’ve heard from you from Bella Coco
I agree, will crochet one for myself x
This is so helpful. I have made a few scarfs but the blanket seems very similar. I am making one of these baby blankets but I am trying out a smaller yarn and smaller hook. so i did the math and i did 4X as many chains to start off with. i think this will take me a long time but im excited! will send pictures when i am done
Hi. This tutorial video has really helped me into making one. Thanks so much for sharing and making it look so easy. I would love to share the photo of how my blanket has turned out, but i see that photo attachment is not available here. Anyhow. Gracias :)
Too fast for beginners
Ohh
ohhh
Way to fast!
Ew the sound of you swallowing
My blanket came up short 😔 so I have to buy another ball of yarn. I used the big ball of yarn
What the heck...you’re going way too fast for beginner. You need to slow down bec it is hard to follow. I’m learning now so it’s overwhelming
GODBLESS...YOUR GOING TOO FAST...HHHRRRR...HMMM...LOOK IVE BEEN TRYING T O LEARN CROSHAY FOR YYYEEEAAARRRAASSS...N EVERY VIDEO T H E PERSON DOESNT GO SLOW...RRRRRR..SO ANOIYING...NOW I GOTTA FIND SOMEBODY BETTER THAN YOU WHOLL GO DAM SLOW...R EA L Y. SLOW...THANKS ANYWHO...VERY NICE VIDEO...B Y E
Love that comment screw the baby! Made me laugh..
you are going to fast not helpful at all ! definitely not subscribing to ur channel
I consider myself a beginner and it' s not too fast for me. ~ Jen
Love this stitch!  I have a newbie type question though, I assume I can make a baby blanket with a thinner yarn, example #4, using this same stitch?  My guess is I would need more yarn.  I've used Bernat yarn before and it does go fast, but want to see how it comes out with a thinner baby yarn.  Opinions please......
Someone should count how many times she says “crochet”
What do you mean you are going slow
This is exactly what I was looking for! I’m just learning and want to make a baby blanket for my new granddaughter. Being off grid, crocheting will be another way to self sufficient. Thank you for this video!
Hey Melanie, sometimes you go out of frame in your videos. I just wanted to let you know for future reference
The video and instructions are very clear and understandable.  This has been really helpful. For me these are the patterns I like,  this one grows really quickly.  Thank you
Thanks for this tutorial, I am going to try it, I am expecting, will make it for my baby! I needed/wanted a very simple baby blanket pattern like this, steering away from the basic beanie project I usually do. I could already crotch but still feel like a beginner in terms of trying new things.
What I love about your videos is I can watch beforehand and then watch and follow along, pausing and going back as necessary.
This was a very well produced video. Excellent camera placement and precise instructions with very little interference. I did have to slow the speed down to 75% at the beginning and on the end pieces. But now I feel like a real crocheter!!I have subscribed and am looking forward to learning more. Well Done!!
love this pattern, I keep reffering back to it for 2 years!
made two of these...and now making one for my husband...#notonlyababyblanket  lol
why is my blanket circling up wards the futher I get?
Hello! Thank you so much for this easy video and wonderful pattern! I have made a bunch of baby blankets and a few couple throws from your kind tutelage. Your videos are so easy and helpful.   I might have missed this, so I apologize:  QUESTION: Is there a border you would recommend to go along with pattern? I’ve always made this without a border but recently I would like to see if I can add an additional color around the edges.   This is the first time I have ever commented on a video. I can’t figure out how to add pictures of all the blankets I have made just from your video.   I can’t thank you enough. Bless!
Liked your vid Maybe you like our vid. Biggest Crocheted Blanket of the World https://youtu.be/3AMvBrZDipM
Did anyone try it with tbe striped pattern yarn? If so do you have pics? Would like to see it please.
This doesn’t look like it is for a beginner.
I've just started this and it's so easy. Sadly the wool was $20 a ball here in Australia 😱
WHY does easy baby blanket look like a collar? I chained 42 flipped but iamm definitely doing something wrong 😟 plz help
Can you pls tell me can I use 7.0 mm hook to make this blanket or do I need to buy another hook . Pls let me know
Love this tutorial SO much! I've made 2 baby blankets from it and they both turned out amazing!! My only complaint is that I wish you elaborated more on how to finish the blanket because I had a little trouble with that part.
I THINK IT'S SO FUNNY THAT ALL THESE KIDS COMMENT ON YOUR EASY INSTRUCTION - YET ADULTS CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT. Anyway, i made this blanket for my first grand baby. Your tutorial was so easy to follow, and it turned out beautiful! Thank you!
I don't like this video this is supposed to be for beginners or people who know how to do this 😑🙄😤😩😠
My name before i got married was Glynis Ham, its the first time i,ve ever seen another Ham other then family. I love your video,s you make it so easy to follow. thanks
i used the exact yarn and ONE ball of yarn was half that size..
Where is the about box?
Thank you for this great pattern. Can't wait to start!
I did the 42 links and followed yours thoroughly but my blanket looks a lot smaller
does it have to be a chunky yarn or can it be the thin one ?
I love that yarn!  Good video.  Thank you
I think it is very easy and simple and I am 8!!!!!!!!! Ahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahah;-)
Hey Melanie I love it!!!!!!!!!♥;-)
I want to add a border to my finished blanket, which one would u suggest?
I used this pattern for an adult sized blanket for my boyfriend haha! We both go to different universities, so when he's away in the fall, he'll have a handmade blanket from me to sleep with. Thanks for the tutorial!! :)
Very handy thanks
Very nice idea 💕🌷 I hope you visit my channel and see new crochet
Just finished this baby blanket and i sm going totry one with a smaller hook
I love the way you teach! I'd say you are the best I have seen on youtube. Great job!
I like watching it but I can’t deal with the drinking or gulping annoying a loy
How many chains if I want a larger blanket
I love this blanket! I made one for my daughter as my first ever crochet project, and have made 3 more since in different colours! Thanks for a great video! (:
How many rows should we do for this pattern?
Way way too fast... I don’t know how many times I had to pause and look at other videos to do the double stitch. Not a beginners video at all.
Love this!! Thank you so much 😊
What is considered a great length and size for a baby blanket?!? I never was sure of that. In that case to get the required size, how main chains should I do?!? I know it is in the multitude of 6, but in regarding a decent size for a baby. A new born baby or couple weeks after. Someone in the comments below stated 60 would be sufficient. I’m sure anything higher would be to BIG correct?!!
No matter what I do, my edges keep becoming uneven. I’m doing everything that you’re telling me to do in this video. So I don’t understand what’s going on
New Subbie here! Very nice!
i love this project thank you so much! I will be having my channel up soon and review and send a link to you so we can keep this great momentum going! I wanted to ask people have been wanting to buy these blankets from me and i wanted to see how you would price it out. I know the balls go up and down in price from 7.99-9.99 and don't take too long to make but just curious what you would price them out as Thank you again for the video have a great day!
Will try this
Way too fast
Hii!  I love your videos, but I found myself frustrated. I'm a very new crochet- Er most the videos I see are way to fast. I find myself spending more time looking for a video I can follow. I just want to finally finish something. Very slow,step by step,blanket or socks whatever. I know how to chain,single and double crochet,but I get discouraged because its gone so fast and I have to pause to keep up.
You are so good in explaining . Great job
Nice
Too fast
Hey! I realize you did this video several years ago but I'm hoping you can help me out. If I did this blanket in the Bernat blanket yarn, would I still use the hook you have listed for the Bernat baby blanket yarn? Thanks! ❤
😍😍
I dont see a "about" anywhere, what's the measurements that this makes ?
You talk way too fast - I’m a beginner and I have no idea what you’re doing
i like it so much i will make myself one to keep me warm in the winter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PLEASE LIKE
you go too fast
Can you do another video but really slow - as a beginner I couldn't follow it
WAYYY TO FAST
Thank you love the way you teach I have been trying for years and just kept giving up but on one video you said keep trying don't give up even if you work on your project for a few minutes a day so that's what I did and now I love it so I wanted to thank you I never leave comments like this but I did want to thank you if not for you I will not be making anything
Anyone else's keep twisting? I've redone it like 7x.. It keeps twisting on me.
My baby cousins next birthday present!
Do you do requests for tutorials? I’ve just gotten started crocheting and found a pattern but I’m a visual learner. The yarn is Baby Bee sweet delight pomp (5 skeins & I chose Pattycake print). Called Pink Squares baby afghan. Size G-4mm hook. I can’t read & follow the pattern but if I could watch it done, I can learn. Lmk if you would be interested in trying it! Thanks & love your videos!!! -Michelle
STOP SWALLOWING!!!!!!!!!!
You moved to fast. You didn't show how to slip knot. The blanket is beautiful though.
I really love how clear you are describing what to do next and you make it look really easy.  I have made this blanket but I am having a problem with the weaved in ends of the yarn.  After using the blanket a few times, the ends that are weaved into the blanket, come out and it takes away from how the blanket looks.  Do you have any suggestions on how I can secure the ends better.  Thank you so much, Sandy
I love your video
Hi Melanie. I'm 9 years old and I love to crochet and knit. I made this blanket for my ballet teacher's baby. Now I'd like to make it as a throw for my teacher at outdoor school. How many stitches should I put on the hook for a throw? Thank you. This is my mom's account.
Way to fast
Thank you! I was not understanding written directions, video was so easy! I plan on switching colors!
31x35 WHAT?
Thank you for the tutorial! Made my very 1st baby blanket and it turned out beautiful! Thank you!
I can't make it
Can you make me one Melanie
HOW DO YOU EVEN MAKE A SLIP KNOT
Why my blanket came out curvy.
HELP!! I've been working on this project for a week (I'm making it for my 11YO so it's much bigger) and I just found a spot where I MISSED a DOUBLE CROCHET! I've watched a few other tutorials on how to add a stitch but the videos are poor quality and they aren't clear in their instructions! PLEASE make a video on how to add a double crochet without frogging or surgery!! 😩😩😩
Love that yarn. Looks so soft.
When making the blanket, Im 6 rows in. I chained and followed the pattern. Pattern size I read should be 31 X 35. My blanket is only 23 inches long? Why and how do I make it longer. This seems too small.
I love your video fast and  easy to follow Work it out to get stared I'll watch your other videos Thank you God bless
Would bernat  Pipskweek yarn look right as a border. I was going to use vanilla bernat baby blanket yarn and pipskweek yarn in vanilla with your patterns/tutorials! Thank you for all the tutorials! Almost everything I know about crocheting I learned from doing your projects💕
I want to make this a little bit bigger say 6 more inches on length and width(she’s a long baby lol)...will I need another ball of yarn or should two suffice?? I hate to make it smaller but I need to stay within a budget hmmm. Please let me know what you think. I was going to buy the yarn tonight online to pick up in store tomorrow. Thanks Melanie I’m a huge fan!!! I have followed your tutorials for about 6 years now and made almost all of your crochet projects!!! You’re the best girlfriend!💕
This is not good for beginners
Hi there, loved your tutorial. I made a baby blanket as a gift 😊 wish I could post a pic!
I'm just learning to crochet and so far this is my favorite blanket I've done. Thank you for posting your videos. You have made it very easy for me to learn.
I enjoyed this video .I will certainly be trying   to make this blanket ..Quite easy Thanks.
When I do this blanket my row after you do 42 don't look like yours. Its not as tall as yours and the double crochet stitchs at not as profound as your you don't see the holes like yours
HEY MELONIE! WHAT WOULD KEEP MY EDGES TIGHT & FOLDING?
Hello, I've made so many of these blankets! Thank you so much! I e used smaller hooks and mine still don't come out like your blue one...yours doesn't look chunky..I know you said you used a j hook. But the everything else is the same as this one? Thank you for any help! I just love the look of the blue one!💙😘
I just learned how to crochet thanks to you! My mom tried teaching me, but I couldn't seem to get the hang of it. I googled it and your vid popped up. I watched the video a few times and had to take my blanket apart about 2-3 times, but with enough practice (and this vid) I was finally able to accomplish it! Thank you so much :)
Thank you so much for making it simply.
Type of woolen name plz and asli needel
MELONIE YOU ARE SUCH A GREAT TEACHER. I'M A VISUAL LEARNER SINCE MY STROKE! Tyou...AGAIN & GOD BLESS YOU.. 😊
So after u chain 3 on the end and u turn the work around are u doing 1 in the first hole or are u making it a double? I went wrong somewhere and need to know how to not make the same mistake next time
Tyou.. SO MUCH FOR SHOWING THIS STITCH. I HAVE BEEN ON HERE ALL DAY TRYING TO FOLLOW THIS PATTERN & YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE THAT EXPLAINED IT SO WELL. Tyou...Tyou.. 😊
plz help me i cant do it  i want to make one for my cat and make it into a cat bed   :C
How long is this...
Hi Melanie, I started my chain a little too tight but didn't notice this until I was done and the blanket doesn't lay square. Can I block this blanket by spraying with water and pinning it or should I rip out and start all over?
Hello melanie! I love this blanket sooo much! I got the same brand of yarn but in a different color. However, I only have a 10 mm hook. In order to do this pattern, should I use the 10 mm hook or I have to use the 11.5 mm hook? Thanks so much!
She goes too fast to teach beginners!!
This was so helpful and easy. Baby yarn is so fun to work with. Sadly I’ve ran out of yarn and need more to finish the blankets.
If I want to make this into a adult knee type blanket using a super chunky wool how many stitches do I use and can I still follow this pattern, I am using a 12 crochet hook.  Many thanks for your amazing patterns.
Nice
Hi Melanie, I love your tutorials but this one is so easy! I made a huge blanket in the adult colors of cranberry, green and ivory and hopefully I can show you the finished project. I've also done two baby blankets in the pink, yellow, aqua of the baby bernat blanket yarn. They are loved!
I wonder if we are related!   😊.  I loved this video, will be making one for sure!
just found this video!! started mine but it's really tight is that ok?
looks good but way too fast for "beginners".
sooo you really didn't show how to make the slip knot?
What do you mean by slip stitch when you get to the end?
I am brand-spanking new to crochet and was about to give up until this video! Seriously, I joked with my sister "I am a professional adult yet apparently too stupid to learn crochet!" My problems were the edges. Every attempt at a scarf or blanket etc. was a big FAIL due to irregular borders. THiS Video and THIS Brick PATTERN made it very obvious where my stitches belong, and my edges look fine for the first time ever!!!  Will i still be challenged with others? Maybe, but you helped me find success and encouragement. Thank you, Melanie!!  I did have to pause over and over, but that's OKAY. I also Just found that i can slow the playback speed & you still sound quite normal at 0.75!   Thanks again!
I’m making this blanket, and it will be my first one crocheting. Thank you so much you explain every step so clear and in easy way
Not beginner friendly
Thanks for the great video! 37 weeks pregnant and keeping my hands busy until my baby girl arrives. Just after some clarification on the PDF instructions - length of hat is clear (top to bottom) but with crown size (when to stop increasing), does this mean for a premmie, you would only single crochet in each loop for 0.75 inches? (Similarly, for a newborn - single crochet 1.25 inches?) I think using a 4.5mm hook has sent me off in the wrong direction :l
In your next video can you stop swallowing in the mic. Thank you I like the videos! 😊👍🏼
How many of the chain would you do for an adult blanket
I'm making this for myself.And I ain't sharing.
Not for beginners..to fast
I think with a beginner crochet person the chunkier yarn is a great way to go
Thank you Melanie, it's so easy and such a great tutorial x
I have trouble with tension
Hello!  Beautiful blanket, how could I incorporate another color? I'm a beginner and still learning. Please and thank you :)
Very easy to understand and pleasant voice to listen to thank you for sharing 😊 Happy crocheting!
Has anyone else had issues with their blanket curving and bunching a lot?  I took mine out like four or five times due to this issue.  I finally had to vary the pattern, which seems to be working
I’m making a blanket closely based on this pattern and this video just helped me to understand what I’m reading in the pattern!
This is too fast for me ... 😖
Very nice and thanks
This is one of the first full projects that I have ever done. I love your videos. I did this blanket but on a smaller scale than a baby blanket. I made one for my cat. Well now I have 3 cats and they fight over the one I made, so here I am sitting down to make another one hoping they will quit fighting so much. I am making this one a little longer to fit across the end of the bed better.
Is it 42 stitches including the slip knot?
Thank you so much. This was very helpful. My nephew is going to have a new blanket for Christmas
I CANNOT BEGIN TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS HOW HAPPY I AM THAT I FOUND YOUR SITE,  MELANIE!!  I AM 65 YRS. OLD,  AND I LEARNED TO CROCHET YEARS AGO FROM MY MOTHER IN LAW AND GRANDMOTHER IN LAW.  I TAUGHT MY DAUGHTER A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE SHE HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN LEARNING.  SHE CRICHETS SI MUCH  BETTER THAN I DO, AND HAS EVEN OPENED A SHOP ON ETSY.  MY KNOWLEGE HAD BEGUN TO FALTER AND SHE ACTUALLY BECAME THE TEACHER AND I TH E PUPIL. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY PROJECTS I HAD STARTED AND HAD GOTTEN SO FRUSTRATED AND STOPPED.  I WAS JUST CASUALLY LOOKING THROUGH EASY CROCHET PATTERNS ONE DAY AND FOUND YOU !!  YUR ARE THE REASON THAT I HAVE NEW HOPE.  YOUR VIDEO WAS WELL DONE,  AND THE WAY YOU SPOKE,  TOOK THE TIME TO EXPLAIN EACH STEP,  SHOWING YOUR WORK ON EACH ROW ANND SHOWING HOW TO CHAIN , TURN,  AND BEGIN A NEW ROW WAS SO SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND !!  I AM HAVING SUCH A MARVELOUS TIME NOW AND ACTUALLY CROCHETING AGAIN!!  YIPPEE!!  THANK YOU EVER SOO MUCH,  MELANIE,  AND HANG IN THERE AND TEACH  US SOME MORE!!!  <3
What is the size of the baby blanket?
As always you provide the easiest tutorials to follow. I can whip through this baby blanket in a couple of hours. I'm going to use your border video to finish off. Keep the tutorials coming!
Beautiful and you made is easy to understand. Thank you!
but i learned something which is making the end straight and i wanna ask how do i change the color i want to change the color of the crochading
thats a fucked up crochading 😂😂😂
Whoa you've lost me! Way too quick for me :(
Just finished my blanket! I didn't do it baby size, I made it bigger..... for me😁. Super easy. Thanks for the turorial.
Dear Melani,  Thank you so much for your clear and simple tutorial. I did 4 blankets till now but still experiencing the same problem, at the end of the blanket, the foundation chain forms a curve, not a straight line which ruins the whole blanket. Could you please tell me how to fix this point?
Melanie, Can you explain when you end a row you do the yarn over you go,through 1 loop then yarn over 2 loops then yarn over 2 loops, but after you chain 3 and turn you do a double crochet but and you only go through 2 loops then 2 loops not the single loop when you end a row. Any help you can give me would be appreciated. Watched your video 5 times and  I am a little confused? Thank you Nancy
I made this in one weekend as I was watching TV... a little difficult to get started but once you do, you just fly through it!!! Now, my grown man wants one this size just for his legs cause it is to soft and light weight!  I don't know how to attach a picture or I would. Thank you very much for making this fun and easy!
It's so pretty 😍 but so hard to learn 😭

Thank you for your reply.  Do you have a link to your video on how to block ?
Thank you!
How many chains
Good morning.  I made this blanket with the Bernet yarn , my problem is the blanket when finished had stretched out of size and was very uneven.  Any suggestions on what I did wrong?   Faithful follower!!
This is going way too fast
Does anyone else just get so confused. I really want to make a blanket but I can't get it right
Love this video ... decided to make this my first project and I just quadrupled the stitch amount and made it my size for me and then put my last name on it ! It’s absolutely gorgeou
how is this beginner? wayyyy to fast!
Thanks for sharing and I'll be starting my blanket soon!  I'm so excited!!!!
i loved this stitch and out come that I made 1 baby blanket, then I did 3 toddler and 4 adult afghans, every one loved them, thank you so much, I had so much fun as a beginner, with an ending result that looks complicated..lol...thanks again
Thanks Melanie for another great tutorial!! This is my second blanket with you! I tried watching another video to learn the v-stitch and ended up tearing the thing apart  THREE TIMES before I gave up on it and switched back to your videos and it all came out perfect! Not making a baby-blanket but a grown-up blanket with this pattern.
Beautiful
This formula is very very easy to follow..I got my yarn on sale from joann and will do two of these with different color..Thank you Melanie for the tips and what is the right way to wash it when it get soiled>I wonder.. However it took longer than two evenings for me since i have to pull the stiches at the end of the row so it will come out as a vstich evenly..For those beginners expect longer time in doing so since i time myself and had to take it out and redo for the sake of evenness..  You can buy yarn on line from joann and get a good deal six dollars and ninetynine cents and i would use two and a half skein and follow finishing with the border from Melanie other video..Loved it and very easy to follow for begiinners..  Lots of color to choose from and joann has it but michael does not have the big ball.. Good luck to everyone who wanted to start the project.. I have a couple expecting a baby and so I have chosen the color VANILLA and will use the press on letter to engrave the name once the blanket is done for a gift..

How many foundation chain would I need for  blanket 31 x 36 using  baby sport yarn Bernard thank you for helping me
Love it! Love your videos too!
My blanket is long but not wide what am I doing wrong?
How much yarn do I need? 300 g or 600 g? Kind regards! 🌼
thanks
i love it and made one for my new born sister and she is sleeping soundly
If i chain   I love this blanket ! I made 3 already . I am a beginner . Please tell me what size this blanket will be if I chain 72. I want to make one that will be more for a couch blanket rather than a baby blanket. Thank you for your videos. You make it easy.
Not sure how to switch to my account but this is my hubbies.   And I am getting so confused on how to do the double stitch. I'm trying to make a baby blanket for my 3rd baby boy before he gets here in December. 😊 can anyone help or slow things down a bit. Please and thank you.
Can I crochet this using a 10mm hook? Would that change how much yarn I use for this size blanket?
I have vowed to learn something new every year.  I ran across this video and a couple of hours of frustration I saw how this came together.  I have now made four of these blankets and used one with the granny squares.  I love your videos, you go slow enough to follow and pause. If it is possible I have seen a couple of videos on YouTube that is a granny pattern with clusters of three.  Then in some of the videos have a border put on. Would you please make a video for this.  I learn so well with your videos.  Please....Please....Please.....
happy to announce I just released a video on how to put a border on this blanket! Happy Stitching! https://youtu.be/1Sk_oUJNZsc
For all beginners, I am also a beginner and this video was very confusing and hard to follow, I found other vids, I found "a single stitch" method easier to do. Just FYI
honestly, i've been crocheting since i was about 3 years old and i did it with my older sister so we used to go everywhere with a roll of  yarn and a needle for each of us and would just start making things. it was fun
If I accidentally made the base oo tight should I start all over or is there a way to loosen it up... Will the blanket look right if I just continued with a loose stitch form there on out?
My mom's friend learned how to make blankets just by watching your video! She made one for my mom and it's so pretty and soft! I'm thinking of making one now I can't even express how happy I am I'm using the blanket rn
I think this would be cute in all white with a fun pastel variegated border!  I'm making one for a friend in royal blue, charcoal grey and cream.  The yarn is so soft! Great pattern.
Why does mine seem like its getting wider? I followed the directions to a T. Maybe I did the chain to tight??
Just made my 1st blanket from the tutorial . It's great.
Where is the about box????
Gracias. Está preciosa...me encantó.. bendïciones
I love how simple this is. I think I may try this as my first big project. I liked your pace.
I made it! My first ever gift crochet. It's actually a pretty throw. Thank you so much for such great instruction!
Love this project. I am in the middle of a C2C Afghan for a niece but this is definitely my next project. The yarn seems so gorgeous and snugly.  Thank you x
I am doing something wrong it is not flat...
Both of my sisters and my niece are all having little girls all due in December! I'm making them baby blankets to match their nurseries. This is so simple and cute. Now I know I can get them and the pompom rugs to match done in time. Thank you for the video!
You are soo fast for beginners
Beginner? Really? Where's the steps?
I am a beginner and found this pattern and video easy to follow.  I made 3 of the blankets for my triplet grand babies first Christmas last year and they turned out great!
Great blanket I've got a new grandson coming soon and this will be perfect!
I am totally a beginner. I love your videos and you actually make me believe I can do it. I have a few questions. When you are doing the 42 chains are you including the slip knot as #1 or the first chain after you make the slip knot? I think it's after but I don't want to start off wrong.  Also when you are doing the last crochet in the row and go into the last crochet instead of the whole, you do 3 single crochets, turn and do a double crochet into the hole. But it looks like you gather the yarn and do a single crochet then grab two then two. But when you do the double crochet into the hole you don't do the single crochet. Is that correct? It just seems like you put an extra step in after you do the turn. Am I correct? I hope you can understand what I'm trying to say.
you should redo it and do it slower !!
How do you make it not so tight when you start ingot the hang of the stitch but my blanket curved so I had to start over. Help!!!
I'm making this for my cousin Alison aka Ali who is pregnet and already has 1 kid her name is Sophie and she's 4 and her new baby sister is gonna be named Emma
Made this twice for a baby with some fluffy wool I'm so happy my first ever blankets thank you. Great directions
can you make a ring
love it! can anyone tell me if this blanket is comfortable?
Hi Melanie, thank you for this beautiful blanket for beginners like me.  I did this blanket this morning with one skein of 3.5oz yarn just to try it out.  Following your instructions exactly, it came out good but the width of the blanket only measured 16" wide.  I'm not sure why.  Aren't baby blankets supposed to be like 36" (minimum) x 40" long?  What do you think I did wrong and yours looks so much tighter than mine.  Thank you for any advice you can give me.  I even bought the same color, I love the color.
I love this can't wait to try this looks do able in a day
Is there a pattern for a border that would go well with this blanket?
hi.. I have 300g of bulky yarn and needle 8mm.. I want to make a baby blanket. What size would you recommend for the blanket? How many stitches should my foundation chain have?
I am a complete beginner and made this blanket and it is beautiful.  My only concern is if the holes are too large for a new born.  If I use the same yarn, but a smaller hook, will the holes be smaller?
Just finished this blanket and added a cute border! Thanks for your great tutorials!
I know I'll probably the only one but this was so hard to follow 😭😭😭
This turned out great I made my godson one for the baby shower present. I'm so happy thank you so easy and straight forward x
you are going way too fast...
how can you put an edging in a different color on this blanket<
very good
All I'm getting from this is that I suck at Crochet
This video said easy I'm a begginer and it is hard. u lie
TOOOOOOOO FAST WHEN YOU START MAKING THE SECOND LAYER!!!!!
every blanket i have tried to make has decreased or gotten bigger.  so any advise from anyone would be wonderful.. ty
doesnt always work to pull it out from the bottom
Does anyone know how many chains I can do to make it bigger but not too big? Just like about 7 inches or so... plz reply I need to know!!
My hook is 5.0mm
I really enjoyed this video - it was one first ones that I watched (a while back) and it got me back into crochet.
obviously she isn't a good teacher she doesn't really show us or explain it she talks about random stuff and confuses me even more
I learned to crochet when I was like 5 i would make chains and when I was maybe 8 I learned to make scarves for me and my friends  now I'm 12 and wanted to make blanket for my family members  ( but yah know not baby blankets full size) duh 😆 I think crocheting is a wonderful past time I love it!
Thank you Melanie for teaching me all this stuff I made a hat for a baby and I learned it from you,and also your like the only person I watch who teaches me crochet
you are really great at this
A lady on Pinterest has published this blanket 2015 easy cozy blanket
You go way too fast for a beginner
Where is the "about box" ?  I am missing it. LOL
Thanks Melanie I finished my first blanket found the video easy to follow, although I must say my edges could be a bit better, crochet another this time in pink will take more care with the edges
that was soon hard you go to fast and just go slower
how many total rows did you do? thank you fro ur video
beginners I dont think know how to double crochet
Hi. Do you know if I can buy this yarn outside US?
thank you so much for this..Today was my first day crocheting and This is super easy..I really appreciate it..Cant wait to make my nephew his blanket!! How many base chain for an adult size blanket also?
wheres the about box??  I looked below don't know what I'm looking for I guess. I loved your blanket, and I think this might be the one I try to make.
Just so everyone knows, if you have never crocheted before this is not simple.
To make a new born baby blanket do you think just one ball of yarn would be enough?
Making it for my niece and nephew for Christmas.
Also this is impossible
I got that same yarn at Walmart for 2.50
I don't have a 11.50 mm hook would you recommend a 10 mm or a 12 mm for this pattern? I am expecting my first baby and would really like to do one of these blankets.
thank you so much for this tutorial!   I made this for one of my closest friend's first born son. I can't wait to mail it to her!!
HI WHAT SIZE WOOL DO I NEED BECAUSE IAM A BEGINNER AND WHAT SIZE CROCHET HOOK DO I NEED BECAUSE IAM DOING ONE FOR MY FRIEND AND MYSELF FROM MRS ADEBIMPE ADEFUNKE METCALFE
Question at the 6 minute mark: I see the double crochet through the big hole, but I can't tell if you are going through that SAME big hole again with another double crochet, or if you are skipping the v stitch and double crocheting at the next big hole?
what a great tutorial thank you. Can you use a smaller scale (thinner yarn) to do this project. we live in the south and do not need a thick blanket
I just finished the blanket with the help of your video, I am a beginner yet I was able to do  it pretty easily. Thanks alot for the video.I am getting ready to do another one with the purple stripes you did.
I had WAAY too much trouble with this one. How disappointing, as I was so excited about this project.
want is pattern i can find
So I'm confused. You say two big balls of yarn. But I'm the blog you put: Make sure you get the big ball of yarn, its 300g, 10.5 oz, 258 yards, 234 m. So my question is do I get two balls of yarn at 258 yards. Or will one 258 ball of yarn do.
I just finished this blanket, my first real project that I have gotten thru in years.    I feel great and love it!
Great video!! Thanks, Melanie!!
Do you have to use the chunky yarn?
Crochet baby  cardigans
My crochet hook says p/q 15.0 mm the other hook is a 12.0 mm which would give me the same look as your blanket?
gonna start one tonight but with super bulky yarn and a little smaller hook hope it turns out good :D
I am currently making a baby blanket and when I was doing my foundation chain, it got all bumpy. Is there a way to fix that? +Melanie Ham
One where is the about box?  I have a question I did the pattern (sc,2dc) across to last 3 chains, sc  in last ch: what is3-st groups?
About box?  WHAT about box?  :-(
Not for a beginner. Talk way too fast.
Great tutorial.. easy to follow..
i cant find the intructions on how much wook measurements etc where are thry?
Your swallowing is super annoying
Great video. Thank you for posting. Also thank you for getting right to the video. Too many other youtubers start their video and are talking about their nail polish color, they didn't make a car payment, the weather, their boyfriend broke up with them etc.
Thank you so much for posting this video, I have had the opportunity to bless many who I know and don't know with these blankets. I don't sell them, I've been taught we are blessed to be a blessing and this is another way I can do that. Have a Wonderful Day😊 I'm working on one now.
hi there.  how much yarn is used to make baby blanket of this size? the design is simply easy and elegant.  please reply.  😇
Thank you mel. bless you
How long should the baby blanket should be? I'm using Caron one pound. Needle h. Should they be a border?
rubbish melon
I decided to try this and am a beginner so was wondering why it curls aa I crochet?   Doesnt stay straight like yours
OMG, cute blanket but I feel like I need some "speed" to keep up.  TOO FAST!   I have the chain down like second nature, but I fall apart when the doubles start and I have to start all over.....  UGH
How do you do that.Make a nother video that goes really slow.
I will definitely try this
I'm not trying to sound dumb lol. But if I make it bigger do I add 6 chains after your 42 chains that you did here?
I love this pattern. I have never crocheted before so I bought a cheap ball of wool and a hook and gave it a go. I found it very easy to follow.  It took me a few attempts to get it right but got it in the end.   I have now bought the proper wool and hook and will be doubling the size.  Hoping to make a white chunky blanket to go on the foot of my 13 yr old daughter's bed.  She can't wait for me to start it!
thank you for this simple pattern,, it was easy to follow.  it gave me a lot of confidence. im working on my second blanket. the problem ive had with both blankets, is that the original chain stitch row pulls shorter than the rest of the rows. the other rows line up perfectly. what am i doing wrong that this keeps happening? i followed your video to the letter. and i counted the chains and kept track with markers.the only thing i did differently was i started  49 chains instead.
Hello what will change if I use a 9mm hook?
I may be totally missing it, but I don't see an "about" box
Hi Melanie......just a question the blanket that you show it doesn't have the width that much. I've exact ice exactly followed the way you doing it. It's come out very beautiful but it's just the width it's not what you showing I've put 42 as put by you. Pls let me know.
Hi Melanie......just a question the blanket that you show it doesn't have the width that much.
love  it, thanks,  using  this  pattern  for  my  project, and  will post  picture
I made this it was really easy
I'm almost finished with my blanket. I have used 4 skeins of BERNAT BABY BLANKET yarn (size 6 super bulky) in the color PITTER PATTER!  I LOVE IT! TYSM! (P.S. each skein was Approx 65 m) :) and using a size N/15-10mm hook.
do you have to double crochet. can you just do normal crochet?
Is that 31 X 35 inches or centimetres for the final  blanket size?
That's awesome, Melanie- I can't wait to try it!
I would like to make this blanket wider.  You started with a chain of 42, I'm an beginner and not sure if there is a secret to the length of chain you start with. Could I start with 52 or say 62?
I'm not a beginner, have done several granny atghans etc. but my eyes and  hands are now very different. Time crept up on me :(
You say an evening or two but that doesn't include time for pulling out your hair and the gnashing of teeth. That first row nearly drove me mad.. I made mine with 54 instead of 42 stitches.and by the time I got to the last 20 sts I was nearly in tears. Continuing on though and hoping to have it done before my grandchild arrives.I used Bernat Baby Blanket and a 11.5 hook.
So behind!  I've made this before and it turned out beautifully!  New computer & I wanted to print the instructions, yarn info, etc.  However, the blanket is not that difficult.  But dang if I can find the ABOUT tab to print that out!!  Is it just me?  Please tell me it's patently simple.  I don't want to be a dumbo - I just want the instructions!!  Thanks!!
is there a way to add a border?
How do you make a slip knot?
i am haveing a baby coming soon so iam making this for him or her
I can't seem to keep my sides straight, and I can't figure out why :(
🙂ur the best God bless you
THIS MADE NO SENSE I AM SO MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where you Live
I'm not a novice but am far from professional. This really is a simple pattern. Love your video!
Very beautiful blanket but not st all for beginners like me!!!!🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈 getting lost at every step!!!!pls go slow u r way to fast my dear, how to understand while doing Croatia myself?
I'll be starting this project tonight! Thank you for making it easy to understand.
Hi Melanie great tutorial, thank you. Tell me please if a P hook is really 11,5mm? I found two conversion sites where it says 16mm. I wouldn`t like the blanket to be too thick. Thank you if you can help here! Bests, Kasia
This is most definitely a crochet blanket project for beginners! I'm not sure why someone would say "beginner" shouldn't be in the description! It's very simple, repetitive stitching... which is absolutely perfect  for beginners! I wish I found this video a couple years ago when I was learning to crochet! Crocheting can be confusing at first for anyone... no matter the stitch! You just have to be patient and don't give up! I remember watching the same video about 30 times before I understand what I was seeing! I probably would have given up if I wasn't  crocheting my first grandchild a baby blanket! I stuck with it... and now I'm really good at it! I recommend learning all the different stitches and abbreviations for the stitches and you'll be able to read and follow a pattern! My aunt suggested I do that when I told her I was learning... great advice!!
Trickiest part for me was making sure my chain didn't twist around during first row.
where is the "about" button she is talking about???? 😢😢😢
thank you so much!!! I found it very easy to make. I love it!
Melanie is there an easy way to identify the top turning chain if I put a marker on the chain three nearest the hook would that help. thanks.
I made this blanket, with your supreme instructions, for my new grandson coming in April.  Since I'm a beginner it didn't come out as perfect as yours, but it came out pretty good for my third project.  Thanks for such an easy to follow video, and thanks for taking the time to help us beginners.
Love this blanket! my mom taught me to crochet as a child. since her passing, I was reviewing my basic stitches and found Melanie.  I subscribed reviewed, & practiced each one and attempted this blanket! I highly recommend beginners who find this too fast and not enough instructional information,  check out her other videos. I have learned a lot!
Thanks so much for this tutorial. I am a beginner and I had a good result following along. Parts were a bit tricky but I was able to figure it out. I had to rip out and redo a few times as for some reason I was uneven at the sides. Also, I shortened the length because the blanket was for my newborn grandson and I didn't want to make it that big. I wish I could figure out how to upload a picture so you could see, I'm not sure if that's even possible but anyway, thanks sharing. I love the new blanket.
thanks so much for this video but you need to move the mic away from your throat. I don't know if you know this but you swallow alot and it's very loud and gross sounding.
go sex
I'm  British what is the conversion to British standards, for the hook?
How do I get written directions for this blanket?
I enjoyed the howto video it is easy to follow and great for a beginner
beautiful  blanket,  thank u,  ur a great teacher,  God bless
I just tried this blanket. I am truly a beginner and found your rate of speech and movement to be too fast to follow.
my foundation chain is curly what i did wrong?
how many chains would u do if u want to make it for an adult person
hi melanie love your video's I'm a self taught crocheter I'm on my 5th blanket only started crochet 9 months ago would love to see more about boarders as the blanket I've done look like there is something missing.
Has anyone put a border on this blanket?  I have completed it, but it looks "unfinished" and would think that might help.  If you have, can you tell me how you did it and how it looked?
There is no about box under your tutorial
Hi Melanie. what am I doing wrong if my blanket is looking kind of scallop-y. I have been counting very carefully. And have started over several times and still getting the scallop effect. -Amanda.
This blanket was so easy to make,thankyou!
it was super easy to follow some people may just be slower learners then others
this went wayyyyy to fast!
to complicate for a beginner
Ok so this isn't as easy as it says or looks....she goes extremely too fast as well as not showing possible troubleshooting problems....there's not nearly enough information, do's, don't, etc. and please no bashing on me I'm not stupid....
I guess I should learn how to do a slip knot first..... :)
My sister has struggled to have a baby for years. She's now 17 weeks pregnant. I'm making her baby a blanket using your guide. I know this seems like a ramble, but it means a lot to have an easy to follow guide for my first project...especially one that's so meaningful to me. THANK YOU!
I am looking for a crochet pillow shell
I don't see the "about" box you always mention is below the video??
ok so my question is ....If I want to make the holes in the blanket smaller do I use a smaller needle?
loved this video! first time ever attempting to crochet and ive completed 2 baby blankets and 1 full size blanket with this technique! super simple and easy enough to pause and/or back the video up to stay on track. thanks!!
I'm brand new to crocheting (taught myself less than a week ago) and found this project extremely easy, fun and a great way to get the muscle memory of crocheting down. I finished my blanket in just a few hours. Wish I could share a picture of it here! Great tutorial!
How could you put a border on this blanket
This was an amazing tutorial! I was on the verge of giving up on teaching myself how to crochet & then i cam across this video. It came out great. Thank you so much!!! This was my very first project & your instructions were very clear.
The loud swallowing was irritating to listen to. Maybe try not to do that when you are doing your voiceover.
I just made my baby this blanket today! It was my first ever crochet project, so I'd definitely consider myself a newbie, I just paused and replayed if I needed extra help. Your pace of speaking didn't bother me. My baby blanket is awesome and I love it. I will say that 42 stitches made a really small blanket. I'm sure my 4 month old will outgrow it within a couple of months. Next time I'll follow this patterns and add extra stitches. Other than that, I LOVE it!! Thanks!
I am self teaching myself right now, as well. Is there a way you can slow this down? The transitions especially are kickin my butt. Thanks!
About how much would you charge for something like this. I trying to learn new things for my online store
too fast and confusing. good try though.
this is way too fast for a beginner!!
Very easy to follow. I just stopped the video when needed and went back a few times. One question, how loose is to loose & how tight is too tight? I have a tendency to do stitches too tight. Thanks for sharing this. I look forward to many more projects!! 😄
can you please talk slower
Can u do stripes with this method
Are you able to use the same stick for a regular size blanket for adults?
Does it really take 2 balls of yarn?
I really like this one....it's a lot easier than the Tunisian stitch
I am halfway through my first baby blanket first ever crochet project and it looks great! For people having trouble watch the video multiple times and you'll pick it up. And it takes practice. I did some practice rows before I started the "real" blanket. Doing this gives you permission to make mistakes.
Do youhave a baby blanket pattern for muli-color yarn.  I haven't been successful in following the mfg. directions for a lace border blanket.  Thanks
This is so so easy.I made my first baby blanket for my baby sister and now I'm doing one for my cousin.I didn't use videos to help,I actually messed with the yarn until I figured it out and then I watched this to see if I did it right and sure enough you did it the same way.I love crocheting
What are the measurements? I f you chain 42 first row how many inches should it be?
I absolutely love all your videos and I've made several of these blankets but it sounds like you're eating while you're talking or something... it's very distracting...
this is the worst beginner vid ever
why does the chain have to be in multiples of six?
I don't see the about box.
I tried it! It came out slightly wonky (I messed up a bit), but looks nice for someone who has never crocheted a blanket before. Thanks!! Love this video!
Pls how can I get the set of your kind of hooks and yarns?
your videos are the best
this is my first time making a blanket I would like to send u a pic on Facebook but I can't find u on there
Where are the instructions
Could you double the initial chain stitches to make this more adult-sized?
cute the twitter that you have will not let me in i followed you in instagram and google+
Thanks
i love that you did very much
Okay, so I'm a little confused. Do you continue to do a double crochet twice in each hole and then only one double crochet in the beginning and end of the line? It's kinda hard to see
pro 🖒
I'm making a blanket for my 2 year old cousin
Moving way too fast for a beginner video.
so cute
Suppose to be for beginners. Definitely not
I'm on my fourth chain! I've never done this before. Hope I can keep up this momentum. =)
does the slipknot count as one on the foundation chain? or is it slipknot then the first chain after that = chain 1?
Such a good teacher ..mine turned out just like yours ...well almost lol  Eileen
thank god ..I saw your tutorial ..I was having a hard time... thank you so much ..Eileen
easy. ??? I got lost after the 42.
Do u really need 2 balls of yarn because she finished with one ball
I love what you did
will a 12mm hook suffice?
i think that to girls
I'm a beginner and just finished my first blanket. Came out great! can't wait to see my niece all wrapped up and warm.
I'm  teaching myself to crochet and your videos have made it so much easier.
I'm sorry but you suck at explaining for beginners. but you do beautiful work and I'm sure for the experts it's a lot easier. p.s experts are not the ones that are looking at your videos. so maybe you should slow it down some of your going to do tutorials
Thank you so much. I have made three blankets for my family. You're Amazing
this did not work!
about to start my own project and I'm hoping i can follow your instructions you make this all look so easy!!!
thank you
If it is a beginners blanket please go a bit slower please
beautiful thank you will do this 😄
Loved your video easy to understand !
Can you do one that's a little slower. Like slow your hands down I get lost easily. And yes I am a male crocheting.
I love this video and pretty much all of your videos! I was just wondering I double crocheted in the last chain on both ends will that totally mess up my blanket or am I ok to just keep going? Also I did 150 foundation chains because I wanted to make a blanket big enough for myself is there some point I should stop making rows or can I go on till I think it's big enough for me? Thank you again you have helped me immensely with learning to crochet and sew keep up the good work! ❤️
THIS IS LAME
making this blanket for my grandson for Xmas..ty for the video 😃
if I use a 10 mm hook will it be good?
omg seriously all i could hear was her swallowing her spit every two seconds
I made 3 of these for baby sister, and my 2 baby cousins! Thank you so much! they turned out perfect!
What about a border? Could I just do a single crochet around the entire blanket? Has anyone done this?
Nothing works
Can I do this left handed
I have been given fuzzy, fluffy, stringy yarn?? It's hard to crochet with? What can I make with it? Patti
I so tried I did not get this. She doesn't do a good job of explaining.
Hi whot yarn ar u using
This is a wonderful pattern. I have made tons of them. They are very easy to do. I put a trim on it of another color and make baby hats with loom kniting. w the other color for the brim. They are really cute. Thanks Linda
Melanie, just finishing making this but looked after and edges do not all look great is there a easy edging I can do on the edges to neaten it up please
she reminds me of ijustine
Way to fast for beginners video!
Pretty annoying. Obviously you are great at this but this is not a "Beginners" video
i believe i made a mistake.  i used 60 chains. i wasn't able to skip one at the end. not sure what happened.
my anut is having  a boy!
Melanie. I have a question about the yarn. I think I bought the wrong one because mine looks thicker than yours. Did you use just Bernat Baby yarn or the Bernat Baby Blanket yarn? I bought the Bernat Baby Blanket yarn and it's really thick lol I've been using the same crochet hook 'P' as you suggested.
This is a beginners blanket. The easiest one out there. So go back and watch the tutorials that show the basic stitches and practice, practice, practice. Quit blaming someone else for your not being successful in making this blanket. This sweet young lady took the time out of her busy schedule to make this video for us. Show some appreciation. She has done an excellent job!
Hi, Melanie!  You have done an excellent video. People that can't do a basic stitch need to go to the tutorials that show how to do that. I would never attempt to crochet a blanket without first learning the basic stitches. I'm tired of these videos that think they have to reinvent the wheel each time. Too much time is wasted on how to make a slip knot or a single crochet. You complainers need to learn the basics ( there are many good tutorials out there) and then you can join the rest of us in making this beautiful blanket. Stop being so critical of others. Take on some responsibility!
The yarn looks like a large intestine.
I am having so much fun with this and almost ready to send a picture! Only thing my ends look messy, not all neat like my foundation chain? So my question is at the end of my row do I loop into the last chain of the three single chains? I know to so one single double crochet just don't know if I am looping into the right loop??? Please help!
How long duz dis  take??
I've not crochet sense I was really young, but I saw your video and picked up my yarn! It's day two and I'm about halfway through my blanket. Super fun and super easy! I've just been doing it as the baby sleeps or sitting in front of the tv. Thank you!
how in the world do you do that!!!
Super easy I made two for my two new nieces. The mommies loved them!!!
I can't wait to get some warm fuzzy yard and crochet a new grand baby blanket! Thank you for helping us with your video!
I would like to make this afghan but I would like to make with a smaller needle and smaller yarn. Is that possible? And what would the measurement's be? Please help!
Melanie can you possibly answer how to do a double crochet border, because I added tulip stitches every 15th row m spacing is slightly different but I do not understand when following this pattern's instruction where to go with the do in the border, in the chain spaces or in an actual stitch or both....can you please help me with this?
Can you/anyone give me some tips on making my Crocheting and knitting channel?
I made a newborn pouch using this Stitch and it came out amazing. wish I could post pictures to share with everybody this was an extremely easy project!! thank you for sharing your videos with us
I love it. first time crocheting. my blanket is looking beautiful. although I'm using smaller yard and hook. at first I just did as many chains as I wanted and had an extra when I got to the end. I improvised and it still looks good. I plan on making a bunch of these and experimenting with different yarn.
im using bernat baby softee yarn and 4mm hook. how many stitch should be my foundation chain? i got 2 lilac and 1 white
Hey Melanie, I would like to make this blanket but a larger size. Can you make it any size you want? I'm a beginner to crocheting.
My blanket turned out great. First time making a blanket at all! 😀 Thanks for the easy tutorial
Please help!!!!!! How do you add a border to this blanket?!?!?!
I think I'll stick to sewing:D
I'm lost
do you finish the edges? If so how? Thank you I have made almost 2 in less than a week.....
That was excellent, Melanie...well done!  You have a very pleasant voice and manner and great explaining! A super easy project that goes quickly and looks super!

I wanna create a business out of my crocets creations
I wanna create a business out of my crocets
uhhhh *head spinning like cartoon head before puking* this was sooo fast and confusing... i am a Beginner.. so this video is Not for beginners
i cant find a crochet hook in 11,5 so i have 10 or 12...which one should i take and wht difference does it make??? love this blanket!!! subscribed in an instand :D
Youre going wayy to fast for a begginner
I made this baby blanket, it was easy
Any tips on washing and drying the blanket? Thanks!
Thank you, Melanie, for your videos!  This blanket is easy to crochet, and very pretty.  I've already made two of them, as gifts...
why did I have to find your video? now you have me up and getting dressed for a trip to Walmart in the middle of the night lol.  I absolutely love the blanket you made and being that I am a beginner I completely understood the steps to making the blanket.  I picked a neutral color because once I'm done with the blanket I'm going to pack it in a diaper bag with some goodies for a baby and donate the entire diaper bag along with a box of diapers.  I live by a facility that house teen moms and their baby so I instantly knew what I was going to do with the blanket as soon as I begin watching your video.  Thank you Melanie
Beginner should not be included in the title name.....
Am I doing something wrong? One of my ends looks like its decreasing while the other end is lining up nicely. I'm following you every single step and haven't missed anything
How many chains does the adult size blanket have?
Hi Melanie I wanna make a big blanket in this same tutorial so how many stitches am I going to need?
Why did you use that hole instead of the big hole to start with? Thank  you
With this yarn (which I am also using) 42 chain is a little short, I suggest anywhere from 60-80
can you help us by the yarn we do not have a fat yarn and we want one
Beautiful, I'm not sure I see the about box though.
Melanie, love your tutorial videos! You are an excellent teacher and videographer. Thank you for sharing your tips and patterns. You make everything so accessible, from written instructions to links to materials on Amazon. Awesome stuff!  I simply loved this pattern. It was so easy, and came out looking fantastic. My friend's little baby boy will love it!  If it's something others are interested in, too, I would love a tutorial vid from you on how to make a simple women's poncho/shawl. It's one of my very favorite fall looks.  Thanks again! Love your work.
I want to add a backing to this project, any ideas on how i would go about that?
thank you annisa
I made this blanket and I wanted to add a border. how do I do that? do you have a video showing how?
When we're "skipping a stitch", is the stitch we're skipping connected to the last double stitch? The video sped up at 3:06 right when you were skipping it. I'm just having trouble knowing exactly which stitch to skip...any tips?
I feel like I am one of the only kids that crochet :)
Question  if you wanted to make it a twin size would you double the chain stitch to 82
i made 45 foundation chain,i m using himalayan dolphin baby yarn.iam having problem in finding yarn in this country.most of the online stores are not shipping to this country,option available are chsrging huge shipping charge.how do i get good quality yarns?
hi melanie,i think i having same problem as andrea
melanie I am adding.every 11 rows (because I am doing 66 rows) a tulip stitch. wondering if you think I need to add after this V stitch a row of single crochet and then my green the stage for the stem and then the tulip puff style Stitch or if I can successfully convert from my regular color that I'm using the speech to the next row being green I'm just wondering if I need to waste the time on a single crochet which is how a lot of people are showing the Tulip Stitch done.
Sorry, but how do you transition into another ball of yarn?
this is hard
mutiple of six I am not sure what that means can you explain a little more. I am self teaching myself and have caught on to single, double a stich and slip a stich so far. and I have picked up what you have shown on this video. just don't understan multiple of six.
can you use other yarns for this project to make lap blankets? thanks looks quite easy.
Hi Melanie! Im getting ready to make this but I want to make it bigger. I only have 4 skeins of Bernat chunky yarn. It's 220 yards each. I want to make it for my dad so it's gotta be bigger just like a throw size. Definitely bigger than a ba baby blanket. How many chains can you recommend if I only have 4 balls of skein? (I can purchase more if it will come out better) but I don't know how many chains to start with? Can I just do however long I want like 50 or 55 chains or does it have to be an even or odd amount of chains? Thank you so much for your videos I am watching all of them and I love it!
so i only have a j hook also, could i keep loose stitches ir do i need to go buy a new hook? (reallllly cant go buy one right now so id have to wait)
Beautiful blanket. I crochet blankets. I can't wait to try this pattern
Good evening, I just finished crocheting the baby blanket that you had on YouTube I would like to know how can I do a border
Bella Coco told me Aboutaleb you ...😘
my blanket is curving, like its not even :(
I really want to do this pattern, but the biggest crochet hook I have is a J hook. Is that fine?
so I started out with the 42 chain but it's not big enough for a baby blanket
Hello....  I have an issue!  I thought I had finally gotten this blanket pattern down pat when I have not discovered three quarters through that I had missed a stitch so a quarter of my blanket is 24 and half is now 23...  Can I somehow fix this without having to rip it out AGAIN!!
I cannot see the drop down box with the info????
How can you make sure your ends stay even?
This went way too fast for me. I've never crocheted before and I wasn't shown how to do a slip knot and nothing was simple. The instructor spoke as if I would know the lingo and I was totally lost on knowing what a chain was, etc. Cute blanket and would love to learn but this was not for someone who has never crocheted before.
like how many chain for blankets peach
Just wanted to tell you I have my blanket going on and your instructions are perfect and easy to follow!!
Has anyone doubled or tripled the length and how did it turn out?
can i make this blanket bigger for a toddler or adult and what is the number of chains do i need to start with
BlizsaoimsaBAt2.00Alfmstrik
If i want to increase the size for an adult size blanket, should I increase my foundation chain by a specific number, or any number? I know you used 42 foundation chains, Im not sure that I would use 84 or not.
i love this video
my sister is having a baby in december! i MUST DO THIS FOR HER!
This pattern is so true to its title. i am considering making an adult version of this. Bernat has adult versions of this same yarn. love it.
I did a lot of ripping out the first couple of days as I kept adding a stitch somewhere and my blanket would get wider. Like anything else, patience and perseverance is key when learning something new. Really, really, really check your foundation chain after you have completed it to make sure it is exactly right because if that is not correct, it will throw everything off and count your stitches carefully. As for people who say this video is too fast, that is what the pause and rewind buttons are for.   I finally got it right and added a single crocheted white border around it. I'm really excited to be able to give this as a gift at the baby shower for my first grandchild next month. It was also good practice for me. After practicing a few other stitches with some dishtowels, I ventured on to making a pair of booties to go along with the blanket and am going to begin making another blanket next week for a friend whose baby is due soon.  Thanks, Melanie!
You didnt help at all too fast
I made the blanket and it's not wide enough ! Is there a way to add width ?
I love this I learned to crochet and knit a year ago when I was 9 I am making a blanket right now:))
Please help.  why is my blanket starting to create a wave patterns.  I'm on my third row & it's not hanging straight.  what have I done wrong?
I am a beginner. I started this blanket and decided to do stripes since I'm short on the same color yarn. If I wanted to add on to the side with the foundation chain but have the v stitches go the same direction as the rest of the blanket rather than the opposite direction that will happen if I use the same stitch and tie on like I'm switching yarns?
I wish I could put this in slow motion so I could do this 😩
Love the blanket, but she goes WAY too fast for a beginner and not enough instructions on # of chain if you want to make the blanket smaller or larger than 42, cause it's not adding up if I make it smaller :-(
Hi Melanie! Just a question lol I'm curious, why did you do a double crochet twice in the same loop, does it change the look of the blanket compared to just doing it once and going to the very next chain rather than skipping a loop?
How would you switch colors?
Would this work to make a king size blanket and if so do you know how many foundation chains I would do?
I'm a beginner and I would like to learn and that if you can make me a video showing me how to make a blanket but that's our version because I'm just starting
Love the baby blancket .i have orded the wool soon I get It will start it  thanks
I made this blanket starting with a chain of 42. I like the length but not the width. I was hoping I could add on to the width but I am not sure how to with a finished product. If anyone could help me that would be great... I tried my best but the V stitch would be going the wrong direction and I don't think that would look normal. Please help!
how many chains do I need if I want to make a larger size blanket? and about how many ball of yarns do I need?
two DC next to each other is Not a V stitch so anyone actually making a V stitch will end up with a different blanket then yours and their stitch count will be wrong.  I was wondering why my D in Law was going nuts trying to make this.
I love this tutorial. I love the look but I thought I'd try to do the whole blanket double crocheting just in the small space next to the post instead of in the large save between v stitches. it turned out pretty good though I did make my chain to tight so it's a little uneven when folded. thank you for my first v stitch and baby blanket tutorial :) ♡
hi can do this pattern with a different size wool and hook?
i thought this was a great beginners tutorial. ive never crochet before and my blanket turned out pretty good. the only disappointment was the end. she really doesnt go into detail on how to end your crochet. She breezed over it.  for a first timer like me i had to go watch other videos to learn.
please make this video not fast please made like this video  and if you made like this video who is not so much fast after making that video Please send me in comments that video name!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is my request
Help, please!   In the video you mention you will be alternating the double-crochets to go inbetween the V stitch from previous row, but the video does not show you doing that.  Then I looked at the written instructions and it says the 2dc are put between the V stitches.  I'm confused.    Thanks for your help.                                                                     Bernat Baby Blanket YarnWRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS:Slip knot and chain 42  4th chain from hook place 2 dc  skip a chain, 2 dc and continue along foundation chain  Once you reach the end, 1 dc in the last chain  Ch 3 and turn1dc in first chain, skip 1 ch, 2 dc and repeat (the 2 dc should be in between the “v” stitches front the first row)in the top chain on the end, place 1 dc. ch 3 and turn

you need to slow down i have no idea what you did in the first part
Why at the end of one row you double crochet in the last stitch and the end of the next row you double crochet in the last open spot??  Please explain.
I'm don't sure if I'm am doing it right course it doesn't look like your one and I'm very upset about. I wont to make one for my baby and my sister in law baby :( :( :(
awesome video I have made tons of baby blankets for showers
I thought it was suppose to be easy
I have a question. For a blanket, do you have to double crochet in those open spots or could you just do them in the chain?
why instead of going into the open spot at beginning you go into a chain? then after that you go into open spot...confused. I went through first ball of yarn crocheting firat chain then open spot for rest of rows...
you go so fast that its hard for beginners to follow. please redo the video.
I love this.
thank you :-):-)
She talks way too fast to follow!
My daughter is trying to do this blanket and gets upset because at the beginning it is always curled up and wonky.  She thinks the blanket will then be like this.  What is she doing wrong?
I just started crocheting and after searching for someone easy to follow .... YAY I found you! Thank you so much for your easy instructions.
Can I add an accent color for a border on the edges of the blanket.?? How will I do that?
I want to make this same blanket but adult size; any thoughts on how many chains? Thanks
I am on my 5th row and I have noticed that my blanket is straight but then it starts to curve. I don't know what I should do. Any suggestions?
good day. Could you please tell me how thick the yarn is???? and how do you choose the hook?? thank you.)))))
This is for anyone who can help. I have been minorly crocheting for about a year or two, and only ever learned the simple chain and regular crochet, but even with that it never turns out. My ends never stay the same length, which, I know now, is because I didn't count and I kept getting smaller amounts of stitches. but how come when I do my first chain, I have to go down a size or two with my hook in order to even get it to fit in between the stitches? I've tried using less tension but then it just looks loose and aweful. what am I doing wrong?
My first blanket! I love your tutorials--great videography, great instruction and explanation. Thank you so much!
Thank u Melanie for this tutorial!!! Want to make one for our first great grandson.
Thank you for the tutorial. I wanted to make my cousin a baby blanket for her first baby, but I haven't crochet in a very long time. Watching your video helped a lot.
I'll*
This looks like the perfect thing I can make for my nephew! I'l probably use blue or green though. :) xo -Chloe

im so lost I'm new at this i need help
How many chains do I have to make for a baby blanket using another kind or yarn, if I'm going to use a 4.0mm hook... pleaseeee helpppp asap!!
It is so complicated!!
How do you buy the pattern books ?
I made a mistake and my yarn won't let me unravel the knot. I accidently made increases a few rows down. any suggestions?  😊
How big would I have to make this blanket to make it a twin size? How much yarn?
Love this blanket!! I will continue to use it in the future!! Thanks Melanie
I'm starting to crotchet and I'm making a blanket and this helped alot.
I would like to know can you use this way to make a afghan because this is so easy to do for a begginer
This is the very first thing I'm making after learning to crochet 2 days ago. I love it! I'm Making my own baby blanket for my baby that's yet to be conceived ;) soon hopefully! Thank you!?  ONE QUESTION THO I can't seem to find the right strand in the middle of the ball of yarn and end up using from the outside ;( HELP!
slow down
I made this blanket but did a starting chain of 60. 2 full packs of yard made a blanket 32" X 42". it's the perfect crib size. And so simple to make. it literally took me about 3 hours from start to finish. and that's being a novice.
if I wanted to make a blanket for myself how many stitches would that be to be exact
Help Mel I have questions!!
Melanie, absolutely love your crochet tutorials. Just started during the winter crocheting, wanted to let u know how much you've helped me learn. This video and a couple of your other ones are my go-tos every time I have a project. I've made several baby blankets and I love how quick and easy this one is. I usually finish it in a day or 2. Keep the crochet tutorials coming. Looking forward to the next one😊👍
Pensa tu tejer con las Mano
WOW!!! I did this project....and it turned out great. I don't have bulky yarn that worked with me and i didn't have a P hook. I used smaller yarn and it worked perfectly with just one piece without two. I am a youngster doing this so it looked very complicated but it wasn't. I am so happy it was easier than it looked.
B.T.W I'm one of your  fans
I absolutely love that you showed where to properly pull the yarn from. No videos I have watched so far have added that useful piece of information. I assumed that was the proper way but my yarn kept getting tangled, perhaps it was an isolated situation. Thanks again, I can't wait to make this
Can you use it for a ten year old? 'cause I am.
I couldn't watch this movie because your throat noises annoyed me. Would have been a great pattern though
coucou
If I wanted to add more length, what r the multiple number of chains that I need ??
wow good
I' m looking for a bulky round rug crochet pattern , want to make for grandsons room
Melanie, I followed your VERY easy tutorial and tried for the first time this baby blanket. I didn't have bulky yarn in the house so I doubled my yarn and think it turned out pretty goodWish I could post the pic
its cool this is awsome
I wanted to start his blanket but didn't have bulky yarn in the house, so I used two pieces of yarn together and got kind of the same look.  I think it came really great.
What just happened? I'm already lost on the chain.  No captions telling what to do.  Guess deaf people can't learn from this :(
i need helpp, ive been practicing over and over and for some odd reason it starts off regular size and then as the rows add up so does the width and it doesnt look normal at all. i am a beginner but trying to make this look professional
YIKES! I have had such fun with this project and it looks great! HOWEVER, I am creating too much length (e.g., when I add the second skein, I will have a 17" x 62" blanket instead of one that is more balanced.) How did I do this? After one skein, I have 31" long and 17" wide. Apparently, I'm crocheting on the wrong side!
I made this one and LOVE IT thank you, thank you, thank you.    I did start with the P (11.5) hook then after the 1st row changed it to a smaller one and it worked out perfect.
sorry turned out great
Hi Mel I completed two of these blankets they turns out great thank you :)
I bought My Yarn For Only 3 Dollars at Walmart!
I can't find the about box.  My about box is just about youtube
Thank you! This was easy and great for a beginner. It was only my third project (second successful) and it was done in a few days. I added a border to it using treble stitches and now I have "boxes" framing this blanket. Perfect!
300 grams total for the baby blanket or 600 grams? In the description, you state 300g but didn't specify if that's the total amount needed.
I also make the double stich on the foundation chain but its not attached to it its like its a whole other side
I have a question! every time I try to do the second step of the double cross stitch when I try to pull through the first loop it gets to tight to pull through, what am I doing wrong???
l need crocheting for dummies. :( that looks HARD
I found out that my fingers started to hurt lol XD
i went to your fb wall but it would not let me post a picture. Loved your video very easy to follow.... Do you recommend a certain trim or no trim at all?
Do you have to use a big hook like that???
this is a beautiful blanket and cant wait to try it and will be for my first grand baby due july 2016! yay
thanks...i am expecting a  baby girl, and u helped me out...
I CANT DO IT XD XD
how do they do scarf anyway
I'm making six of the blankets right now. Thanks
can I do this with a k hook?
Melanie, years ago someone showed me a blanket they made using a big hook, but they used 3 colors of yarn at the same time.  Is was fluffy and soft.  Do you have any videos using multiple colors of yarn at the same time?
Hey Melanie, I've made 4 of these blankets for my grandkids.  Loved making them.  But I never get the 31" in width.  I chain 42, but still fall short about 7 inches!  What am I doing wrong?
Melanie is it possible to put a boarder around this blanket?
I'm a beginner and the last chain is hard to understand. which loop is it exactly?
I use the same yarn as you
Melanie,do you have a video of how to do the chevron stitch?
never crocheted in my life & have no idea what's going on.  slip knot? double crotchets? not even understanding the first loop. where do i get this info?
Great video. Thank you for the details. This is a project that is easy to complete. So many blankets can take a lot of time but this one I can make in many colors ahead of time. Nice!
i made one before cool
how many rows is this blanket
Can't wait to see my baby cousin shell love it thank you👍👍
hello. I am an 80 yr old great granny and a very inexperienced crotcheter so thank you for such a simple blanket and very good tutorial.  i am hooked. yay!!!!
My very first crochet project for your beginner baby blanket went great easy to follow along, Thank-You. Now I am excited to follow along on some other ones.!! Thank you so much for making it so easy. Great blanket. Thanks, Kathy

super easy ; ] .............................how many hours took you to make it
I'd e plani batteria be cause when you took the yarn it was complicated to see which one you took
Hi,  I did the 42 chain stitch but mine measured only 27 inches instead of 31 inches. Not sure if I am making my stitches too small. Also, I didn't use both large 300 g balls and my height was more than 35 inches. Can you please help,me with this? Thank you  Nancy
I need to make this for my 16 year old about how many scains of yarn do you think I would need
Thank you for your post I enjoyed it and learned (relearned) how to do it again.  I did not have right size needle so used my fingers and it actually turned out great I wanted a loose feel to it and turned out great!!
how many rows u do
can you add a border to this blanket
bern  I love the blanket but its not wild enough don't know what to do help??
can you use a lightweight yarn....3 weight?
Not for beginners more like intermediate I guess it depends on what you classify as a beginner.
2 skeins of the big yarn to make one blanket?
OMG Love it i learned alot thanks.
I knit so I'm about to start this it should come naturally to me I been knitting since I was in 3rd grade
good pattern for beginners. Thanks.Maria
Beautifulllll. Thanks :) ♡ ♡ ♡
What kind of math should I do to turn this into an adult size throw.
Hi,I've had quick look through comments and can't see how many balls for a baby blanket,even tho I did say I may do a bigger one.Then I will know how much more I will need.Thanks Tracy.
Oh plz bear in mind,mine is a growling bear LoL I think.Anyway bear in mind I have only got a size ten hook and I want it to cum down side of bed alittle,u know what I mean not just fit the top only.plz help it's my first crochet project and am itching to get started..

Hi,I am wondering how long to do my starting chain for a double size bed spread plz.Only a beginner but it doesn't look to hard,bit I haven't tryed it yet and I will have to give up if it proves to difficult. But I thort id go for it anyway. Thanks Tracy.
I'm going to do this blanket in boucle yarn. Love it!
Hi Melanie, I love this baby blanket and would like to make one for my baby.  However I"m new to crocheting and am a little confused as to the size of the hook. I see that the recommended size was a 6mm hook and you used a size 11.5mm hook? Am really confused as to which size hook I should use / is best for this project. Much love from Melbourne :)
Pity  Amazon  doesnt ship this yarn to Australia!  I'd  love to  make this  blanket.
Hi! I have tried with the same yarn& 9mm hook and it looked good but did not getthe "bump" line she does. Then went and bought same yarn 11mm hook to try again but it seems all loose and funny. Am I not knitting tight enough? How do I get those bumps? Thanks!! :)
So pretty, I love the color.
I used one of your  patterns with Boucle yarn and it's turning out beautiful. I've had this yarn in my stash for several years, wasn't sure what to do with it since I was a beginner back then. I used the hdc on my project. You really inspired me. Love your videos.
Thus here be bold. I deliberate, like, literally, be I getting a shetland cattle yonder p't'noon, I be liberating ye wool, unto my crocheting 'til the Lord God above taketh my arms away to yonder doomsday.
I loved this project and think it would be great for my granddaughters to do.  Please let me know if you have other suggestions for them.
You said easy
i started croching at age of 10 i been crocheting for a year and now im 11 on my 11 birthday i asked for yarn and i got it
what do these phrases mean
Question: how many rows do I do
I've been traveling around the Internet (10 videos) with no luck of how to crochet a simple baby blanket for my next door neighbor's baby shower! They all went to fast and you couldn't see their hands. Until finally, I came across this video! It was super simple, easy, and straight forward. I can't wait until this is finished! Thank you so much! :)
I have issues when I crochet, I use the needle the yarn says to use, however after a few rows the chain and the first couple of rows do not match up, should I use a bigger needle when I chain and the first row then change over to the needle the yarn says to use!.
Made this blanket yesterday for a friend expecting a 1st grandchild, so easy once I got started and I have not crocheted since high school!! Thank you so much, have subscribed to your channel and will be making more.
Great video. I love all the information you give in the video and the about section. And I like how you show how much a ball of yarn makes, that was every helpful. Thank you for the video. :)
Thank you so much for the super easy tutorial. This was my first attempt at making something other then granny squares. Made this blanket for my grandson and it only took me 3 days and 6 balls.
i have been crocheting for 3 years now (8-11) and i can make finger-less groves, scarves, blankets, dish clothes, shawls, and I am starting to learn to make a sweater.  I also weave, knit, and sew.
Hi, I am going to use this tutorial to crochet a blanket for my friends their first baby. As I am in the uk, what size hook as we don't have 11.5mm - size00. Please advise 😍😍😍
I live in Australia could you plz tell me where I can buy this wool Barnat wool because I have gone every where or can you plz send me a email address so I can get it sent to me thankyou Elaine
I am crocheting a baby blanket for my brother I'm 8
I am wanting to use a lighter weight yarn, will that work? I have a light pink, white, and gray...what size crochet hook do you recommend for a lightweight baby yarn?
Hi Melanie,  I am making this blanket for a co-worker who just had a baby.  I used a size N crochet hook 10.0, Bernat Baby blanket yarn (6) and added 6 more stitches for a total of 48.   I thought the added stitches would make my blanket wider, but I have ended up with approx a 24 inch wide blanket.  It is not wide enough for wrapping a baby and I was thinking of adding a wide border or combination of borders to help with my miscalculations on width.  Since I am a beginner... how can I do this?? Or is there another "simple way" to correct my error??  Frustrated and hoping I don't have to pull out an entire project!!
Ahh you're going so fast!
what material are you using in this video is it yarn or wool?
hi melanie!  great video! very clear with instructions! so I started making this blanket too I'll send pictures when I finish! should I add a border to mine with a different color and if so how do I do that
How many balls do I need to make a blanket this size?
It is the big ones like u used
I got an extra ball of yarn will I have enough to put a border on the blanket?
would be nice to get answers to questions thanks
Thanks for making this video. Pattern was super easy. Even made a Queen sized blanket with this pattern. Thanks again for sharing!
hi I made one using this patter. my question is if I chain 66 do I still skip the 1st four chains?
thanks love it and i love baby blanket yarn it so soft when using this yarn you can crochet a quicker blanket than using smaller yarn
this is too fast for a beginner. it is very difficult to keep track when almost every person that makes a video starts to make a stitch and then backs out and goes very fast. wayyy too fast. too much talking.
I have made two blankets using this pattern. It is fabulous and works up so quickly. My husband asked me to make a baby blanket for the wife of one of his co-workers. I needed something in a big hurry as she was having the baby in about a week. After searching on-line for quick-to-make crochet baby blankets, I came across this pattern. This is how I discovered all the videos and patterns you have to offer Melanie. So glad I did! Keep up the great work! Thanks!
Amazing tutorial. Super easy to follow. Finished it in a total of about 10 hours. Mine turned out to be 80 x 60 cm using a 7.5mm hook. I started with a 72 long foundation chain. Thank you very much :)
I scrolled through looking for an answer to my question, but since it looks like you don't answer people very often, I'll just ask and cross my fingers lol! How would you put a border around it? Also, I'd like to make a lap blanket, so how many chains would you suggest for the starting chain? Thanks
Thank.you so much for this tutorial! Its super easy! I'm loving it; I'm making two: one for my sister and one for my cousin's wife (she's expecting her 2nd child). ^_^
Like your name! lol
can this be done with something other than thick yarn?
where is the "about box" ??? does anyone know where this is
how long does it take to make something like this ?
Hi! I'm on the 4th row of my blanket and its curving around from the first row of cast ons. Do u know why this is happening? All I can figure is the first cast on row was too tight? & thanks for the video!!
will 2 balls of yarn just make enough for a baby blanket? I wanna make one for my friend and I'm afraid it won't be big enough
I made this blanket with the same type of yarn but I used the 100g  (small ball of yarn) and it worked out really cute. loved the tutorial! <3
Where is the about box don't see it I want to copy the instructions for this .Please send it to me.
If I want to add another color how would I do that? I've never done this but I'm about to try!! :)
having trouble finding the written pattern - can't find the about section that is supossed to have the written pattern to print
I liked your tutorial but I only double crocheted once in each spot instead of two in each spot. Should I take it all out or just continue?
I'm in the process of Maken one but I got the same yarn but my blankwtbisnt as big any idea why ?
Great tutorial.  Im going to try it.  :)
Thanks, it was the best way for me to learn!
How do I add a border in another color?
I would like to add a boarder to the blanket and maybe some flowers.  how would you make a boarder and how would you attach flowers to this style of blanket?  Thanks.  Debi
its so anyoing when you are swallowing needs!!
Can you use this same yarn to. Rocket a flower? If so, how would I do that?
plz do better next time
how to do a slip knot
How long did it take to make the whole baby blanket
Melanie,  I am having a hard time understanding how you end the blanket? You said to do a slip stitch, but just one or all the way across the top? Also I don't know if I did something wrong but my blanket is about 30 x 40 and I am half way through the second ball of yarn. I feel like the size is good so I want to stop, but again I am confused at how you finish it? Please help. Thanks!
fantastic thank you . I didn't have a chunky yarn so I used 2 strands of DK .I LOVE IT 💜
So beautiful! This is going in m y favorites file and i am going to buy the yarn and hook today haha  thanks so much for your knowledge, xoxo
I see you turned both ways. Does it matter which way you turn?
My best friend just got a baby sister so I am gonna make this for her. It should be fun!
I have to say thank you for this tutorial.  I never understood how to do this stitch before watching this, now it is like I have been doing it for years.  Thank you so much.
So easy, I made this for my little brother and he carries it everywhere! He named it Tinki and he takes it EVERYWHERE. We went to the doctors office and he brought it with him. He loved this!
I used a "P" hook and extended the initial chain to 60 stitches. I hope it works out. The stitches are smoothed together so you can see the brick look. My son likes the material so I am excited to get this done. I can't wait... so buying a bigger hook can wait until the next project!
Hello, I am making this blanket right now and am wondering if it is normal for the material to be curling? I have just done one row so far, but when it is laid down onto a table the material makes a "rainbow" shape. Thanks!
I love this pattern! I've been making blankets for all the new babies in my family and this is my favorite pattern!
Slow down.  This is suppose to be a beginner blanket.
Thank you so much for this awesome tutorial!
How many chains should I have if using "L" hook? I'm due in June and would lime to have several blankets of newborn size done.
I'm having a problem. I'm on the double crochet across the chain stitch, and my stitches look GREAT from the front, but when I flip over to the back there seems to be a lot of loose loops that stick out and look strange. Any suggestions on how to fix these? I'm using a 9.00mm hook (which is the recommended size for the large yarn I'm using).
I love this pattern! I am just starting out. My first project was a scarf. I was a little nervous about starting this blanket but I finished in 3 days! Just in time for a friend's baby shower. Everyone loved it and asked me to make more! I am looking forward to making more of these and experimenting with different sizes. Thanks for sharing!! 💗
hi Melanie,  im currently using this tutorial/pattern to start a baby blanket as a gift for one of my friends and its really goong great, its fun and easy and really has a beauitful look. i was wondering if u had an suggestion on if i want to add a border to blanket. i too have used chunky yarn, same size hook u have, but all the videos im coming across for a border are more for a medium yarn and i think that will not work. please advise on what you think I should do. thanks so much and will definetly aend u pics when its complete!
I'm using your pattern right now, but I'm using a hook size n.9 what hook are you using? I want my gaps to be bigger... would it need more yarn with bigger gaps? will hook size also my gaps bigger?
I tried so hard to focus on the last bit of each row and it still came out all wonky!
Just curious to know about how many inches of width an extra 6 chain set would add?
I'm a lefty, so do I just work in the opposite direction and have it turn out the same?
I made one of these for my niece and she loves it. What would be the best way to wash this?
I was really confused
I have a size S/19mm crochet hook and I was wondering if it would work for this project? You also have a Chevron blanket tutorial where you use the P hook and I love it but this is the biggest hook I have all the others are J and below. P.S. I love love love your tutorials thank you for sharing your talent with us :)
Will Bernet Blanket work with a 10 hook?
I just watched this video and noticed you used a crochet hook to weave the yarn at the end.  In your newer video with the chevron blanket you recommended to use a yarn needle.  Any reason for the change? Also,  in the newer video you don't knot the yarn anymore,  but rather weave in the ends when changing colors. I'm rather curious about these things :) PS I use the crochet hook to weave the yarn ends :)
this is my first attempt to crochet.... kinda not going well lol not sure where I'm going wrong.
What happened to the stitching if you use a smaller hook?
Hi Melanie - how many would you chain for a king size bed :)
hello i was thinking to buy a blanket for my 24 month boy... after watching your video... i decided to diy my own.... thank you very much.
love this
I've been crocheting for 15 years and this project is so simple and fun. I'm making one for my 10 month old son.
I've been crocheting for 15 years  9yrs old-24 years old and this project is so simple and fun. I'm making one for my 10 month old son. he loves blankets and I'm always thinking of new ways to make his blankets.

SLOW DOWN I CAN'T FOLLOW
slow down
can you go slower
I would love you to do a video making booties and a hat to match this blanket
I don't see an about and I really want this pattern. TY stropescents@gmail.com
its been some years since I crotched I almost forgot a little but your video instantly helped me. It feels good to crochet again because its something to occupy me. Thank You. -Bella
Thank you so so much for this video! I am a beginner and my blanket came out AWESOME! The only thing I am having trouble with is ending the blanket... can you show how to do that and what the correct way to weave in extra strands? Thanks so much!
Did anyone else get grossed out with her swallowing her spit really loud and obnoxiously
I hear people talking about locking your projects.  Is this something that should be done with this blanket.  Also, what's the best way to laundry the blanket.
You go way to fast for a beginner.
Hi Melanie, I am a beginer to crochet and I am going to start on this blanket! Can I make this with 2 of the 10.5 oz Bernats balls? I don't mind if it is a little smaller...
Very helpful! 😍
do I need to use bulky yarn for this?
Hi Melanie, thanks for all your videos! I'm a brand new crocheted and find your videos very easy to follow! I am making this baby blanket with a finer yarn and I want to know if there is a way to attach crochet flowers to an already made blanket without one side showing where you weave them in? Thanks again!
This was my first blanket ever! Thank you so much!
I must be doing something wrong once I get too the third chain it starts curving am I doing it too tight? First timer here!
Halfway done and I'm so in love with it.
Working this blanket now. Word to the wise for anyone who reads these comments. I am by no means a beginner although I have never worked with this yarn before. I worked the foundation chain and first row a few times and pulled it out to get the feel of how to control my tension and working this yarn in general. Can't wait to get this done for my grand baby who is scheduled to arrive in a few months. Thanks, Melanie! Another great project! Expanding my knowledge and experience!! You're awesome!!
Thank you so much for your help I will try that.  I tried to download the written instruction but it won't open not sure if there is another page I can get them from
how many chains do you need to fit a crib?
I really liked your vids!! Inspect my channel if you want! :)
Three of my friends are having babies this spring and I decided I would learn how to crochet just so I could make these for them ... and I just finished the first one!! Thank you for the video, it was easy to follow and crochet is in my genes so I finished this in a few hours. I didn't read the about section and quickly realized I had two of the small balls of yarn so I used 4 of the smaller ones instead of two ... it turned out smaller than yours but will be perfect for a baby. Making the second one this week, and this time I got the right yarn. Again, thanks!!! :)
I tried to print the instructions, but the link seems to be broken.  Help!  I'd love to be able to print them out.  Thank you!
Wonderful video!  It may be helpful for new crocheters to check each row to make sure you have 2 dc in each space except for the beginning and the end.  I found out I only had one in some spaces down several rows  It only takes a few seconds to check.  Thank you so much for the video!
This blanket is perfect! All my friends and family are having babies in the next year. I was able to complete this project in a day! Looks like every body will get a blanket!!!
its a hook you use for a rainbow loom
How long did this take because I want to make it before i go to science camp. It is in a month February
is it ok if we use a rainbow hook
I'm a brand new crocheter and I am loving this pattern! Thanks for the easy to follow instructional video.
Like the way you show your work and do step by step. Thank you looking forward to more videos.
Mine it a little tighter so it is not as wide as your.  Do you think that is ok?
this looks so cozzy i want to make into a scarf
Melanie thank you so much for your video, I am 58 yrs old and have never crocheted a day in my life. But I decided to make my grandson that is due in 2 weeks a blanket. After watching your video it is so easy and I am having a ball. I couldn't find an 11 needle so I got an 10 and it seems to be working good. I will surely post a pic when I am finished. Hopefully before he arrives so my daughter can bring him home in it. She will be shocked she never knew her mom had so much talent. LOL Thank you again for your help.
A project for instant gratification. The TC is too large. I've promised myself I would do this for my wonderful Husband who unexpectedly died at the age of 59 this past Nov. 16, 2015 as he was the Master Carpenter who finished all his projects & I was the forever Procrastinator. This has been my Bereavement Therapy & I'm sincerely Grateful! Although it'll take me much longer, I look forward to enclosing a picture of the finished project. Thank you so much! THIS I can handle! If only all of life were so simple & sweet!  ☺
Melanie,  I found the cutest Blanket on my favorite subscription "All Free Crochet" under Afghans. The original post was a variation to your Baby Blanket & since I'm a total Beginner and have not yet completed a project I went with your instructions only using a smaller hook. I'm using a size K hook, which is supposed to be a 6.50 metric. The big difference is I'm using 3 different colors. One is Blacklight, one is Bight Mix & the last main color is Pretty N Pink, all by Red Heart. The Pink is The Super Saver Skein which is huge & a great value for your money. I loved these colors because the Pink really makes all the other colors 'Pop' & stand out so nice!      I don't know if there is a trick yet to adding the colors together so they don't 'step' on each other, but I don't think you get around that unless you can start a the end of a row where you add a chain stitch.      I think this is an excellent pattern because having tried a SC it takes way too long & is very tedious if your wanting a form of instant gratification. And TC is way too big a stitch for a solid blanket I think. This will still take me awhile since I'm making a standard Blanket/Afghan and using a 6.50 hook! I love the way the stitches look on a completed project so I can't wait to enclose a picture when I'm done! Say a prayer & wish me luck! I look forward to this as this is my much needed Bereavement Therapy for my Wonderful Husband who just died unexpectedly Nov. 16, 2015. I've yet to come to grips with it but one of my Promises to him is to finally finish things I start. In his namesake as I was always the procrastinator & he wasn't! He loved to see me relax and see or make Jewelry, & he loved to help me lay out my Quilt Blocks in my designs! Always the Master Carpenter he could put anything together. Thanks for such a pleasant & beautiful project! -       Suzi. ☺
why does my blanket keep getting longer the further on I go?
You did an excellent job of teaching and showing exactly how to produce a lovely baby blanket...thanks so much.  Love the project and your instruction was clear, concise and easy to follow.  Gratefully in New Mexico!
do we get it in India?
loved the blanket .... what type of yarn are you using?
The largest hook I had available was a 7mm, but it still turned out very nicely. :) And i used Bernat Blanket Yarn. It's just too bad I can't post a picture on here.
This is a little harb👅
Does the slip knot count as 1 chain?
i can't use that much yarn. I would appreciate a blanket that uses less yarn. You do a good job describing the details in the video, though! I watched it for fun. It was a great video!
I attempted to teach myself how to crochet about a year ago using books and online videos and just could not get the hang of it. I turned to loom knitting for a while and enjoyed that. When I decided to revisit crocheting last week I came across this video and thought "I can do that". I watched your video on single and double crochet and practiced for a couple of days until I got comfortable with those stitches. I went out and got the supplies for this project and I immediately fell in love with this yarn and doubled the supplies and started with an initial chain of 60 to make a blanket anyone in the family can use in 2 days! I already picked up some more of this yarn to try a different pattern and have found a new obsession. Thank you for your fantastic videos, keep them coming for all of us beginners to follow along.
Hi there, I was just wondering if you have any suggestions of a border I could put on this blanket?  I am very much a beginner!!
you go way too fast i cant get it
this was really easy i caught on after the first. row. the only thing different i did was made my first chain alot longer
If I use thinner yarn should I make it wider (the foundation chain). Thanks!
i love that blanket
Hello Melanie, why does your 41 chain look so long ? I'm doing it also but mine looks so short, so I increased the number. Am I doing something wrong ?
Thank you Melanie for such an awesome video made simple good English without distracting accessories on you as you record. I made my first one    and love it! Kim
Sorry but I can't seem to find the about.
Just about to finish my first blanket for my new cousin who is due in March!! :) This is a great tutorial, thanks!!
I'm making a big blanket for my grandma for Christmas. first time ever so I hope it turns out I'm just using more stitches and following your instructions. so far this has made it easier to follow :)
Hi. Is there any way you can show more video of you crocheting the blanket? I am apparently super slow at this thing, lol. Thanks so much!! I am really excited to make this before our baby comes in a few days ;)
Hi Melanie    I am a beginner and I can't find how to get the instruction  for this project  I found the about tab but it don't bring up the instruction to print it out . Can you help me    Margaret    myjoy86@zoominternet.net
does it have to be a double stitch? i wanted to do a single stitched one
Sorry, forgot to tap the thumbs up icon and I find your tutorials are easy to follow  for I haven't being crocheting for 30 years and practically forgotten everything.
Would like to know the measurements of this blanket if there are 600 chains. Thank you
Ok,listen I got the same Bernat baby blanket yarn expect in blue for only $3.47 And yours was on sale for $7.49 Talk about pricey
mantitasdebebe
Dear Melanie,  Just wanted to say that I successfully made your crochet blanket! At first the uneven chains drove me nuts but after figuring it out slowly and playbacking your vid over and over again it worked! So happy! Thank you and I've also used your other tutorials for quilting and sewing. One question though, is it safe to DC on another chain before chain stitching and turning to avoid wavy ends and avoiding the rows becoming smaller? Other than that, Thanks sooo much!
it is to hard!
I have this frustrating problem with yarn, every time I start a project I pull the yarn from the middle (inside) of the ball. Then suddenly another end will come out and it keeps getting tangled with the strand that is already being pulled out. What is the proper way (if there is) to unwind a ball of yarn?
how do you weave in the ends of this blanket?
i still cant get it down
This is my go to for baby blankets. I have bought countless balls of the Bernat baby yarn to work these up. Great video!
I'm trying to crochet for theorist time and I can't even seem to get the knot or chain going I need help!! 😩😩
nice my mom nos how to make that were making it today
Thank you so much for making this video; I had no idea what I was doing but you are a great teacher, easy to follow and understand, and my blanket is coming along beautifully!
I new it cool
Hi Melanie! I completely understand what to do but, no matter how many times I try and redo it my stitches won't get any looser. What do I do?
Hello Melanie! I want to thank you so much for your tutorial. I've been trying to teach myself how to crochet through youtube videos  and I haven't been able to make anything. Until I watched this and suddenly everything became clear to me! I made a scarf for me with this exact stitch and also a baby blanket for my newborn niece, which you can see on my instagram here:  https://www.instagram.com/p/-l3yJ2QTaT/?taken-by=hugsandsofties  Thank you sooo much!  Lots of love from Greece! <3 Kiki
Love your videos!!!!!💙💙 question can I make this for a adult?😊 I really appreciate all your tutorials I learn so much from you💙
I love this video. it's very easy. thank u somuch
I love this video and I  am making blanket for my baby
Facil, y hermoso.☆.Beautiful and easy . TKU.
I got the same exact yarn at walmart for 3.97 a piece...
Super easy to follow, I've only been having issues with it's getting a lost stitch between my "v" stiches. I've tried make it a bit tighter to see if that helps and it still doesn't help, . Melanie any suggestions what may help. Is this even something to worry about?
I love the video. helpful. only I didn't like was I could hear every time you swallow and a lot of mouth sounds. annoying :p lol maybe not have the mic so close to your mouth.
That looks easy I'm going to try
this looks so freaking hard 😦
Where is the about button? I dont see it
Hello there  Would it be Ok if I buy  the 3.5 Oz and just connect all of them together ?  Thank you.
i hope i can learn to do that
Hi Melanie! Does it matter how many I chain to make the blanket larger? Thank you!
Well,I've signed up for another class and have been enjoying my knitting/crocheting class for a year now.I've come a long way in crocheting and just finished a big blanket in double crochet.Single crochet just doesn't work for me.I made my 2 daughters long d c scarves last week.
can you meke me one
after not crocheting for 10 years, I found this pattern difficult for me, but love the bulky yarn.   Could you offer a more simpler pattern for a baby blanket for same yarn?   I am practicing chaining, as I chain way too tightly also, thanks much
I love this video and all of hers she's the best teacher the I cant stand to watch the others that go to fast or to slow or over talk. thanks Melanie you've help me learn so much!!!!!! I taught myself the chain stich from a book and had only made thing using that one stich . your teaching method is right on time easy to follow easy to pause and catch up. the next thing I want to learn is and old fashion Victorian looking baby blanket and the old fashion granny squares. I've found other sites with other instructors out there for these but none by you  may I'm just missing them tell where they are and I'll be using them tonight !!! I'm so excited to finally be learning more from someone I am the ultimate beginner. I need you Melanie thanks for being there.
Ok, so to make a blanket thats for a full size mattress, how many stiches do i need for my foundation chain?
This blanket is definitely find for beginners! I just started crocheting, and have made at least 8 of these for Christmas presents! I've used multiple kinds of yarn (mostly bulky kinds, just not all the super soft super bulky used in the video) and they work up wonderfully!!
I just love, love, love your tutorials! I am a beginner who has been afraid of trying once again to learn the stitches necessary to make beautiful projects to bless others with, but I decided to check out your video and was so amazed and comforted by how easy it was to follow along with you and how at easy you made me feel. I greatly look forward to checking out your other videos once I get more yarn. Bless you!
mine is turning out pretty alright! its my first actual project and im so addicted to this!
please help
mine keeps ruffling what do I do?
love ur videos soooooo helpful as i am beginner i was wondering if you could recommend the best yarn size to edge the outter side of the blanket? thanks in advance
HI MY NAME IS BERNETTE ARTIS the movie was very easy my question is can I use a different kind of yarn to make this and needle.
You didn't really show what you did to finish the blanket
I just started this tonight. Thank you so much for this easy tutorial!!!!! :)  I will post a picture when I get it done. :)
it was a little advanced for me (beginner). Maybe I need a baby beginner video (lol). I don't know how my grandmom did this. She showed me as a kid, but i forgot. I will have to watch your video a few times. It looks easy, once i get those few steps down. I don't even know what a double stitch is. I love the apricot color yarn you used. Do you sell your blankets? They sound like great gifts we can make for holidays too. Thx

For some reason i dont feel like 42 will be long enough? I purchased the same type of  yarn you used just in a different color... But 42 across doesnt seem as long as yours. I have ripped my work out several times. I started last night and ripped it out 3 times before i gave up and went to bed. Help?
you didn't show how to make the slip knot. I want to start tonight
where else can I buy they yarn at
yarn too thick and bukie
helpt me thanks
crochet  baby patterns please. x
Just wondering what I am doing wrong -- my blanket is buckling (it's not flat like yours)
V helpful, and thanks for showing.
This was so helpful!
just finished this.   it's my first completed project.    I started a bedspread before this but wanted to finish a project.  this was so simple i did it in one day!     the chain was apparently  too tight because it is tighter than elsewhere.     I'm starting a second one more hopefully my chain is loose enough
I want to make a multicoloured blanket, would I just have to stop after a few rows and tie on another colour? I'm kind of new to crocheting, done one thing before this
I want to make one for adult, where can I buy the yarn, supplies and everything? And how many yarn balls should I buy? Thank you.

Loved this tutorial and my blanket turned out great! I would love it you made another tutorial for a blanket maybe a bigger one other than the block one you have!
were do i find the about box?
a video i think i can actually follow...thank you!!😊 my second grandbaby is due less than a month away, 'i think i can'!!❤❤❤
just finished this blanket for my baby girl. this was my first project. the blanket came out really good for my first attempt. thanks for the video
so cool how you can do it in 9 minutes
Is there a boarder pattern for this blanket? I would like to do one with a different color...
I like how we can see your feet in some of the shots. :p
its too fast i cant follow the first step.... i thought this was for beginners
I am a ten year old girl you have got me into making blankets hats scarves everything and I have made my own blanket of this same brand and everything it's so nice and soft so comfortable
Very confusing
I wish you would go a little slower for beginners. I literally just got my yarn tonight and can't follow this at all :(
You are so good explained it's very easy to understand love it thank you so much.
in order for mine to be 31 I had to chain 60 and the final size ended as 31×32. I followed everything exactly and bought the same supplies
Hi, is yarn OK for the blanket? Thanks
So, if after about 4 rows it looks more like a U than a straight line, so I assume that I made my foundation chain too tight? Thanks so much!
Great video do we have to use large hooks and where do u find them
i have a 10mm hook what should i do??
it's looks confusing
I have made two of these blankets and I love them however, the sides look sloppy, any suggestions? would love to maybe add a border...
just loved your tutorial very informative and easy I'm not new to  crocheting but needed a refresher course
Just love your things. Wish I could work faster on these afgans, they are so beautiful.  I love learning new.patterns.
I am not seeing the "about" tab mentioned in the video.
Melanie, Hi! My daughter and I are doing this beautiful project, but ours looks tight at the end, (or begining) and it looks like its growing wide instead of straight....can you help us? We are doing 2 of them, do you want a pic? Hope you can help us!
Totally lost me two minutes in.
I would give u a trillion 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
I'm having issues with crocheting on the last chain, I don't know what the "last chain" is and my blanket keeps getting wider.
I will try to make this blanket, I am not good in crochet but this project look easy and fast to do, and like Linda I will donated them to a Senor living Center on x-mas
that's not for beginers idk how to make a knot
screw the baby part I am making one of these for myself!!!!
another question- can the chain ever be loose or tight but not too tight?
i got the smaller ball so how many chains should i do??
this is too quick for a beginner
I'm. making this blanket but I've increased the chains to 240 as making it for me and my husband. really enjoying it. thanks for a clear video.
You dont show us how to do the foundation slow either that or my little sis and i didnt see
Enjoy your videos.  you do a good job. I had to have messed up somewhere bc my blanket got larger as I went on.  My starting row was smaller than the ending row...help...
Seems really soft that i like:). Can i make it for adults? Should I make it for more than 42 (at the beginning)?   Very clear video!
Do you have any suggestions for border on this blanket
Question. Loving making s blanket. But it is bunching up. What did I do wrong?
I started the blanket but wanted to let people know walmart had the exact same brand yarn for $2.97 regular price.
Hey Melanie ,  I just started crocheting, i'm using your video as a guide to make my baby girl on the way a blanket. So i started the blanket and i believe i'm on my 5th row if not 4th. One of my sides isn't straight  and i would like to start over, i realized what i was doing wrong. do you suggest undoing it all or just starting over with new ball of yarn ?
this might have already been asked, but when you start the next row and do a single crochet, are you using that small opening or can you use the larger one also??
This video sucks u actually have to show us how to make a slip knot and how to chain!!
so if you chain 72 your still doing the steps exactly the same as the video?
I'm having problems doing a double crochet
I'm having problems doing a double crochet
Hi Melanie, I just made this blanket and it was great. I would really like to make another baby blanket in but maybe with a softer not as think yarn. I also want an easy similar to this stick but without a boarder. I don't think I'm ready to try that. any recommendations?
I'm going on a 4 day trip to Pali for school
The hook I used is G/6 4.25MM
How do I add on
My blanket came out so small
You are amazing but for me it is so hard
So you make the foundation chain as long as you want the blanket to be and then just keep adding rows until its as wide as you want it to be?
Hi Melanie I'm a beginner at crochet and have done the first line of double crochet for this blanket twice now following the instructions but I still keep getting 3 chains left on the end instead of 2. Any suggestions? Thanks
Well found it should have looked at your about box right silly me
Hi Melanie I am having difficulty getting the crocheting hook can get 10 or 12 but not11.5
Melaine, I need your help..I have made this afghan and am dying to show if off to you!  I do not have Instagram and for the life of me can not figure out how to send you a picture!I 'liked' your FB page..but still can not get a picture to you!  I want you to see how tight and beautiful it came out!!  Go to my FB page plus I PM you!  <3
Thank you for sharing this, it is so easy and awesome!
What kind of edging would you suggest finishing the double crochet baby blanket ?
Just finished mine!! I absolutely love it!! First grand baby is almost a month old. Thank you for your easy to follow instructions!!
Hi Melanie! Loved the video and did exactly as you told but now my blanket is curling after the 4th row, similar to when you use fan stitches. Is this normal? Should I continue or start over? Since my yarn is not as thick as yours, I'm using a 4 mm needle. Please advise and thank you.
Thank you so much for this baby afghan it was very easy to follow and do ! I am half way through it ! When i finish i will post it so you can see it !!! Again thank you ! Its not only easy to follow but i love the way that it looks to !!!  Ty sandy
Wow that is a big hook and bulky yarn
Hi Melanie love this blanket, I  am on my seventh  now, thank you x x
If i wanted to make the blanket bigger for a teenager instead of baby could I just double the amount or chain stitches and length ?
Hi I only have a 10.0mm hook could I use that or should I buy the same hook you used thank you :)
Hello!! I hope you can get back to me.  No one has ever written back to me when i have questions!! Please get back to me ASAP if possible.  I want to make this blanket very very soon.   My friend is having a baby.  The gender of the baby is a surprise. I was going to just make an all pale grey blanket but I'm now thinking, I could do pale grey and white stripes.  Do you think stripes would work with this pattern?? Also since this whole blanket only takes 2 balls of yarn, would buying 1 ball of pale grey yarn and 1 ball of white yarn be enough?  Please Please get back to me....  Thank you ahead of time
Hello. How would you add a border?
How many grams in each ball of wool and how thick is it thanks
is it okay if we did more than 42? will it affect making the blanket? I've never tried this before so it my be a dumb question😅
Hi. Do you know how many starting chains you would need for a blanket big enough for an adult and how much yarn I would need?  Thank you so much!!!
Thank you for posting this video, i'm a first time crocheter and this video made it really simple for me to understand how to make the blanket :)
I thought this blanket was very easy for my first project but apparently I have done something wrong.  Your pattern says that it should be 31by 37 approx.  I am only half way through my second ball and I am already at 37 inches.  My blanket is only 25 inches wide.  Well I am proud of it for my first project but still wondering what I did wrong.
looks so fluffy!!!
Hi, I was wondering if you know where I can find the color your using . I'm looking for a solid pink and I can't find none anywhere online.
Thanks for this! This is my very first crochet project and even though watching you ( you're fast!) was slightly difficult at first, a few pauses and rewinds and I was able to do it. I'm halfway done! I'm curious though, I'd love to do a slightly smaller blanket with only 1 ball of yarn. For a newborn baby. Is that possible? If so, how many chains would be on the first thread?
I am using the same thread but a 9 mm  needle. how many stitches should I use for this blanket? I know that the stitches will be tighter, but I don't want it to be smaller.  thank you so much. I have learned what I do know from your videos. you are very easy to follow.
Thank you , thank you.....Your tutorial taught me to crochet......
i think they are getting longer.  at the end before u chain 3 and turn it i was doing 2 double crochet and not 1
+Melanie Ham The link you provided with the written instructions is not working....?
unable to obtain written instructions as it states the site is temp unavailable.  Can you please assist.?  Thank you Donna
i have started this baby blanket. the first time i have crochet besides simple ruffle scarfs.  at the end i did 2 double and not 1. do i need to continue this pattern i have already finished 6 rows like this and the only corner that is off is the very first 1.  help!!
I've made three of these blankets, two baby's and an adult lap blanket.  I *love* this pattern and the yarn.  It works up fast, your instructions were perfect and the results a great hit with the recipients.
Hi i am a new YouTube my channel is all about fashion and beauty please check my channel and subscribe thanks a lot
How would you do a chevron or ripple afghan using Bernat Blanket yarn??? I'm sure there are some adjustments needed when using such bulky yarn. I've made such afghans using reg 4 ply worsted yarn. If you have time please let me know the adjustments in the stitches. Thanks.
Thank you that inspired me
You are going way too fast for a beginners tutorial
Hi Melanie, Thanks for this video. I bought 12 skeins of red heart yarn in light raspberry to make my mom a blanket. However, last week she was diagnosed with stage 4 small cell lung cancer. I am beside myself with sadness and need to get this project done in a hurry now as I don't know how much time we have together.
Great thanks a mil. I have a grand son coming in 3-4wks I needed a quick bankie. I appreciate how simple u made. I'm not a newbie but I'm open to learning new things. Sincerely; Miss Cindy
will this pattern work with a much smaller yarn? mine says to use 4mm crochet hook. my ball is also only 4 oz I bought two of these. thanks ☺
where did u buy the yarn?
Made one for my friends little princess and she loved it! Thanks so much for your help!! :)
Hello! I'm working on this and mine is looking like it has larger holes than yours? Any suggestions?
I want to make it God an adult how many stitches do we cast on
I would like to know the color you used here! Thanks :)
i tried this, and i failed. but then i used this technique to create a circular baby blanket!! im doing it right now and its going really well!!
Would chunky baby yarn work?
Instead of 2 dc I only did one. Is that ok?
how long is the blanket please ?
Hi Melanie , thanks for sharing ..I love this blanket will try it for my grand child who is on the way
How would I go about incorporating other colours into it??
Can you use other yarn and crotchet hooks
Can we make this longer length? I love the pattern though.
you're going way too fast!!!
Hi Melanie, thanks so much for the blanket pattern, I have 7 new babies to make blankets for!!!  Easy to follow!!
So how do I make an adult blanket
My blanket keeps getting tighter and tighter.  :(.  Any tips?
M
Wonderful I love this blanket is also easy to machine washed and fast to dry Love the material. Thank you so much
Hello! I'm a beginner at crocheting.  I love this video and it's super helpful. Down the road, if I wanted to make a bigger blanket, would I just double (for example) my chain?
OMG I'm having so much fun learning thanks!!
I'm a beginner and I'm just starting to make this blanket, you explain and show how to do this from start to finish so well. Thank you! I can't wait to see how mine comes out.
Love love love this pattern! I quadrupled the size and made a giant blanket. My first blanket ever! It was super simple and easy to get the hang of. For sure going to make another one!
granny blanket baby

Hi Melanie,I would like to know where I can buy the 300gr of the baby peach yarn.I was able to buy the 100gr,but would rather have the 300gr,hoping to hear from you on this question.Thanks Christiane from Quebec,Canada
I just found your videos. so happy I did! I am now currently making a baby blanket for my nephew :) thanks to you!
I learn all of my new stitches from you.  So much easier than trying to read a pattern. I am working on my third baby blanket like this. Thank you Melanie! :)
hi! I just finished my blanket and want to add a border. how would you recommend doing it? I wish I could add a picture to show you how beautiful it is 😍😍
I drew inspiration from this video and some of the comments. Regrettably I didn't have a P hook so I used the biggest I had, Which was an H 5.00 mm. Obviously the blanket will have to be larger since the chains are so much smaller.. I chained 312 (it's an adult blanket and I'm really small lol) and completed the same V stitch in the video, but now I'm adding colors instead of just one. Thanks for posting the video!! :)
I wasn't exactly sure how to continue with the next roll I was lost after u said u tie a knot there was no video after that showing how u continued please please help or if u have a video showing this would be awsome too
I am expecting my 2nd grandchild in January and this looks perfect to do.  The easier the better :-)
Can I use an 'N' hook instead of a 'P' hook???
Can u make a crochet phone case made out loom bands please
Looking for the about tab????
When you say you used 2 balls, did you use 100gm yarn or 300gm?
I was 1/2 way through when I pulled it apart to start over.  Somewhere I was getting bigger on one end.  I think I might have gotten looser and added a stitch but I am getting better and I think this time I will do much better.  I also think in the beginning I was doing one double crochet in the first hole instead of 2.  Not sure but I am going to start again.
:(
mine is going down not side ways
It was until after 10 sec when I finished the rope section I knew I was fucked because now I've made a total knot trying to remember these counting session.I wanna do this and god help me grandma but the only thing I can make right now it quilts.
Weird question, how do you wash these blankets? or just yarn items in general. I don't want to ruin the softness of the blanket.
how can u do two color
What kind of adjustments would you make to use this pattern for an adult sized blanket? Love this tutorial! Making a baby blanket from it as we speak ;)
Hard can't do it sorry
Does anyone know what yarn I could use thats chunky like this? I'm from the UK, I can get the bernat blanket yarn but they don't have the colours id like for a baby blanket  (grey for a girl doesn't seem to great) also everything that's chunky seems so expensive and you'll always need more than one ball of yarn, I've only ever found 100g as the largest here. THANKS IN ADVANCE!
I am new to this please say how to get patterns--dont see the link
Know what I am going to explode in 5 4 3 2 1 🍕aaaaaaaaaa
where is the about tab
Would an N hook work for this project?
I'm crocheting this right now.  It's coming along beautifully.  Luxuriously soft and oh so fast and easy. Thank you so much for teaching me this!
How many chains should there be in the foundation chains if I want to make an adult sized, not to big and not to small??
Can a size Q hook work with this? or would P be better? Thanks 😊
easy beginner i don't think so beginners dont go 90mph
OMG!!! How quick will this grow with that wool & hook. Looks so easy to follow too because its so big!
Love this!
Thanks for the pattern . It worked out great. I used Red Heart Super Saver Jumbo yarn and chained 112.
I've started a different crochet stitch, but I'm using the same yarn brand (BERNAT BABY Blanket).
Amazing tutorial! I doubled the yarn and I'm making it bigger for myself!
I'm trying to make this blanket. On about row 4 and I'm noticing that my chain row looks tight (smaller) than the rest of the blanket. What did I do wrong?
Hi my name is michele, i am a 26 yesr old mother of three and i have just recently lost my husband in April. I am now a single mother of three kids and felt like I had to find something to help keep me sane and buzy. I have always wanted to learn crocheting but thought it was to hard. Thanks to you and your easy to follow videos I have taught myself or you have taught me shall I say.  I did buy a so called beginners crocheting book but that was so confusing and hard to do. I then look on YouTube and found your videos. The way you explain things and show your work step by step is wonderful. I am still learning how to read patterns which is very difficult for me. Do you have and videos or good tips for reading patterns. One of the first videos i saw was your beginer tips video and i loved it, it really helped me. The way you talk about not worrying if your blanket or project is perfect that the beauty of it is its hand made. It's not going to be perfect. You also talked about not undoing your work all the time or you could get frustrated because your not completing any projects, and that's so me. I am so glade I saw that video because I am a perfectionist and want everything to be perfect so I would keep undoing stuff and would not finish a project. Because of that video I think alot differently and am able to finish my projects. I can only do this on my spare time as I do have three young kids 1,5 and 7. So I have to do it when my 1 year old baby girl is sleeping or content playing in her playpen. I just wanted to write a little post thanking you for your time in showing and posting these free videos for us to create really cool easy projects. This has really helped me in my greaving process of losing my husband of 11 years. I have found something that makes me feel good about myself being able to make special things for my family that I create/make from scratch and keeps me busy in a good way and happy when I do it. My mother and kids are so proud of me for every project I finish and work on. I just wish I had more hours in a day so I could do this more often it is so soothing and meditating for me.  I absolutely love crocheting.  Thank you again very much. I know you put alot of time and energy into these alsome free videos you make for all of us.. sorry my post is so long.
What color of Bernat Yarn is this exactly because it's beautiful?!!
Hi Melanie, I love the way you teach. Thank you!
Hi Melanie o would like to thank you for your easy tutorial on this blanket I have never made a crochet blanket before but now I'm hooked awesome
thank you Melanie    You are very easy to follow. I have been a crocher for years but find it so difficult to follow written instructions. Now grandma, I enjoy creating things for my grandkids
hi Melanie this looks really easy to make i will be buying some yarn today and starting tonight thanks for the fantastic tutorial
I ordered some yarn and a larger hook. I am beyond excited to do this project this weekend! It'll be my first blanket :)
This is my fist time ever crocheting and Im so lost,  Idont know if its just me, but I feel this video is super fast paced, I'll try to watch it over a few times and hopefully I'll get it. Thank you for posting this video!
Can you make a normal blanket for yourself with this pattern. If so, how
Hi Melanie! I am 12 years old and I wanted to make a blanket for my little baby cousin and this was such an easy tutorial to follow! My blanket looks great! Thanks so much!
that is super sempel thankyou  for the vidio
How many chains could you do if you wanted it to be a little bit longer?
I love your video, but I believe you did not take in to consideration that beginners would not be able to go as fast on doubling. I wish you would have slowed down.
How many rows should we have at the end ??
I'm a beginner and this was so easy with your video and written instructions. I can't thank you enough. I'm almost done with my 2nd blanket.  The part I think is the best is how easy it is to get the sides straight with this pattern and that it works with a wide variety of blanket sizes and different yarns.
im an experienced crocheter so it only took me about 3 hours but this is one of the easiest patterns for a blanket. i love it
That's not easy! That's a lie
How do you end this blanket off
If I wanted to switch colors or put a border around the blanket, how would i do that?
I can't crochet Any tips?
This is my first project, very well instructional video, thank you so much
Recently made this baby blanket and gave it as a gift for a family member that just had a second baby girl. No baby shower this time around but I wanted her to have something special. She loved it!! Now if I wanted to make this blanket out of the same type of yarn but a larger size to use as an adult size throw do I just chain more than 42? As long as it's a multiple of 2 will it still work out?
Can I do this exact pattern for a bigger sized blanket/throw? Would I just need to chain more than 42?
I saw this video and made this my first project. It was so easy I made 8 blankets in one month. I donated them to a Senior Living Center!
Hi Melanie, can you please make a video on how to do a border on those adorable baby blankets, please ?
What if you wanted to use the same yarn, but a smaller hook?
I'm a total beginner. I have the chain stitch (the stuff at the beginning... again, my crochet language isn't too fancy yet), single, and double crochet stitches down pat so I think I can do this. I'll try to make one for each of my teachers' babies that are due in the fall! :)
Melanie just wanted to thank you for your easy crochet videos , just made this exact baby blanket following your  instruction and pausing the video, it came out beautifully, I made it in the yellow color Bernat has , my friend who is having a baby boy loved it. Thanks, and keep making those videos.
Hey, nice video, very helpful. I was just wondering.. my edges aren't straight when i'm doing this, is there something i'm doing wrong? Could it be tension? It started off small and it's getting bigger.. Thanks alot x
I love your easy design and Verbs Blanket yarn.  I chose one for a boy in desert colors.  Turning is always a challenge so the knit stitch markers helped me with it. I have not frogged even once!
Hi
I would like to make this with red heart sport yarn with a "I" hook, but the 31 x 35, how many single crochets in my chain to start?
if i wanted to make this into a bigger blanket what should my beginning row be ?
Hi Melanie, I absolutely love Tutorial. You have the sweetest, kindest voice, & explain things so well. I am an Intermediate crocheter, So this is so easy for me. I love how quick it is to make a throw. Now I do have a question. I have been have problems tying in the ends. I use a sewing needle & go all around then knot it. I don't like the way I'm doing it. But you said to use a crochet hook. How would it stay then , wash after wash? Thank you, Terry Hall
I love this pattern and i am making a blanket, this as my inspiration! Thank you!😀
Hi Melanie, thanks or a great pattern, we don't have the same yarns over here and the one I have  is not so thick, its working up beautifully but I have lage gaps all around, can you suggest an easy edging that can be used on any edge please. Many thanks Rose New Zealand
Dragon
Can you make a tutorial on how to make gratin scales
OMG! This was so perfect, my sister is having a baby real soon and I wanted to make her something special with thought. This blanket was just the right thing. Thank you so much for this, plus with me having nothing else to do, I got this done in about 4 hours.
She made it look hard
This sucks
You should make a hammok
Where do you get your yarn
Melanie  I do not have about box where can I find the directions?  Thanks I love your videos.
thank you great job i love it 😄.
Can you do a tutorial about how to crochet a hammock I am making a hammock
I have a d d sync rum so I get distracted very easily so crochet helps me focuse and it is starting to where off you help a lot!!!!thankyou
I am caleb
Hi Melanie I am a crocheter my self and I am a boy I learn so much from you I am 11
This may sound really dumb but I am a beginner at crocheting.  So what happens when you run out of yarn? Do you use another yarn ball and how do you attach it? Help please I really want to make a blanket but I'm scared I won't finish it!!
Why are my sides cue in? Everything looks exactly how it's supposed to except for the sides, I'm doing exactly what she says please help!!! Thank you http://i61.tinypic.com/2m3prn7.jpg
This was the absolutely easiest pattern!  The first blanket I've actually finished because I didn't get frustrated or confused halfway through! Thanks!
Melanie- I did 42 stitches however my blanket seems very narrow. Is there a way to make it wider once completed?  Thanks, Erin
What multiples is this blanket done in..too make a bigger blanket?
I bought just one big ball of this. Will that be enough to make a baby blanket doing the 42 chain across as you did in the video?
I think you are horrible,kidding,i never heard of you but i will look you up.NOT
lovely
I couldn't even do this. You caught me off guard even with the beginning
I love this idea! Just a question, can you use any thickness of yarn and still get the "soft blanket" effect,  or just stick with the soft bulky yarn? Thanks in advance!
This is beautiful!  Any suggestions for using this pattern but making an afghan big enough for adults?  How many across, rows, etc?  Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! :-)
thank you so much for posting this baby blanket, i learned to crochet,
I do not have this kind of yarn, I have the red heart worsted 4 yarn so how many chains would I need in order to make this blanket.
Why don't you crochet the whole thing ? TIP: for beginners try not to use time lapse so much😓 Don't be a hater see ya later😎
Thank you.  This is really coming along nicely.
I'm new to crocheting.Could you single crochet that blanket instead of double crochet?
This does not help at
or me its nice to think its the hook lol
ok new and  I can even do the lop  ugh  it bugs me  I  think its the  hook idk
I love mine
What size are he balls of bernat baby blanket wool used in the simple blanket 42 stitches 11.5 mm crotchet hook as they come in 100g or 300g. The 300g is over £26 in the uk
Hi I love your video and your instructions are very clear but I have a concern. I just finished my first ball of yarn but I'm worried that my blanket looks much more narrow than yours. It looks long and perfect but not too wide. Did I mess up?
Hi I live innsydney Australia and this is one of the first things I made , I taught myself to crochet last yr and here I am 12 months later only now I'm confidant. Thank you xoxo
im measuring the length of the 42 stiches across and it measures out to 24 inches not 31 like your, why?
i am going to try
how do you add more yarn
I am 1 & 1/4 skeins into my first project.  I am using this pattern with and "I" hook and medium worsted weight yarn called "Blacklight."  It is coming along wonderfully.  I don't know how to post a picture of it or I would include one showing my progress so far.     I used a base of 120 chain stitches and  have 15 rows so far.  It will probably take about 6 skeins for this to be an adult throw/blanket.
Can you count to like 60 and make it bigger
how long does this project usually take?
Thanks so much for this video!!!  I've made two of these for baby gifts now and I'm still a beginner with crochet!  This video makes this so easy and the yarn is so plush that it works up quickly.  I completed each one in about two weeks of crocheting most evenings for at least an hour.  Love, love, love your video tutorials and your blog!!!
I absolutely LOVE this. Going to make them for my 3 grandbabies. Love your channel.
Can you double the foundation row to get a longer blanket?
I'm new to crocheting and I'm having a problem with this blanket. Why is my foundation chain tighter and smaller than the rest of my blanket???
Thank you for sharing this ! It is actually beginner friendly :) I'm on my way to making my first baby blanket, yay!! :)
This yarn and needle was very difficult for me to work with.
I don't see where the "about" button is at !!!
Would this blanket work with a fabric backing sewn or is it too bulky?! Thanks! Love your videos!!
Tried this as my first project and love it. Thank you so much.
I did it
I'm back here again! I made one of these for my baby girl when I was on maternity leave and we use the blanket everyday. I not only use it as a blanket but Also to help shield her in stroller from the sun but love that it still lets in some fresh air on hotter days :) back her to make one for baby boy that my sis is expecting in July! :)
if I use the regular thin yarn to make the blanket (the same used to make the newborn hats) do I still chain 42?
I love this!!! I've made 4 blankets just like yours. My last two blankets I used lions brand homespun yarn in the mimosa color with a M hook and turned out perfect. Do you recommend a border for this since it is a smaller yarn? If so, what kind??? Thanks for sharing. I love you videos...
Would you mind slowing down and giving more precise instructions
I feel like my blanket starts rippling like a wavy skirt or something!  I've unraveled it twice now due to this! Always on the third row it gets wavy! Does it normally do that??
I finished the blanket!!!! There are a couple "W" stitches instead of being "V" stitches but they aren't that noticeable!!!  LOL  I can't share a picture of the blanket here but I will try to post it on your FB page!!!  Thank you so much for your video tutorial!!!!  <3
If I want to make this blanket  "bigger" how many single crochets do I chain ?
looks so soft with that thread
Absolutely brilliant. Thank you , I will try to make it for my new baby .
Hi Melanie,  I'm on my second blanket with this pattern and love it! I am having one problem though: I have used the same materials and followed every step that you did, but my double crochets seem a lot less thick than yours do. My rows alternate, but there are much bigger holes than in your blanket in the video. Do you have any suggestions for preventing this? Should I wash it and hope the yarn puffs up a bit? I plan to start a third one shortly, so any advice would be great!  Thanks so much for your channel.
I am onmy 3rd try with this blanket ... I ripped out the first 2 tries!!! :(  I plug along and the rows alternate and then all of a sudden they stop alternating and are blocks in a row!!!  I don't know how this happens but if it happens on this try, it's staying that way!!!  I've crochet 3 queen size blankets and 3 baby blankets, mostly ripple stitch, and this easy beginner crochet baby blanket is throwing me for a loop!!! lol  The double crochets are not the problem, somehow I'm messing up and they stop alternating!!!!  Wish me luck!!!!
Whats the math on this so I can customize for smaller gauge yarn? Thank You!!
An you make a very very easy baby blanket video with baby blanket yarn
I DONT GET IT
Loved the blanket, I made one already in white and now I'm making another one. Thank you, Cassandra
I can't even get past the 3 step
Hi Melanie, I have made this blanket many times for showers, however, I was wondering how long I should make this great blanket for my mom who is  in a nursing home for on her lap? Should I chain 62 instead of 42?
How do u make wildly and 42 sticks aren't very big so how do we make it wilder all do you do it in sqards...!  PlZ get bk to me  I have done 11 rows how many more to do ! Caza
I followed all of your instructions, but the holes in the blanket between the V stitches seem much larger than those in your video. I'm using the same hook size and everything.  I was just wondering if the holes seem smaller in the video than they actually and it's not something I'm doing wrong. Thanks :)
You can go to Walmart and get the exact brand color and everything elsefor about $3.37 it's a lot cheaper and made by the same company
Could I switch colors?
Melanie, I have a question.  My blanket looks a little more NARROW than yours after I finished my first ball of yarn.  16 x 33.  I know that I started with a 42 slip stick base.  I was wondering for my next ball of yarn if I could start and go down the LONG side vs. the short side. so my blanket ends in more of  a square.  Or should I just take it all out and begin again.
I dont get anything in this video i dont know what a double crochet is i dont know what a slip knot is and this is not beginner friendly !!!!!!
Great video !!!  Thanks so much
how do you do the edging for this blanket. I made 25" x 25" small yarn
is the 258 yds for 1 ball or the whole thing cuz I have 3 small balls of yarn
Can you put a trim around this blanket? How do you think that would look? Or what about doing multiple colors? I wanted to make a grey and navy blanket ... so what do you think would be better? Grey blanket with navy trim, or grey and navy alternating "stripes"? Or neither haha .. This will be my first blanket :)
ז
Hey Melanie, can you make a tutorial for a crocheted pillow case?
So love this video, its with the same yarn as im using. When i get to the second row, it starts to wave and become curly. Can you tell me why? I feel im doing everything your doing but obviously not since yours is straight down and mine isnt LOL. HELP!!!!
How would I adapt this pattern if I was using 8mm crochet hook.
It's really difficult because you give kinda bad instructions, sorry
Ok so I am new but I wanted to give this try and your video made it very easy. I have run into a problem though, I didn't know you used two 300 balls so I got three 100 balls figuring I would have extra. So can you tell me how many stiches to start with, instead of the 42 you did. Does it have to be like an even number or like a set of something like 4 or 6? I hate to have to pull it all out but I know I gotta do it cause I just don't have enough yarn
Can we use more chains than 42
I made a dozen of these and gave them all to my friends and family  Thanks for this .  Never thought I would be making blankets but here I am  How about loom knitting. The ones I find are toooo confusing  You are a good teacher  Thanks Carol
I have tried and tried to Crochet and always seem to mess it up. But I do think I can do this! A must try for the weekend! Thank you for uploading this - I know it was almost a year ago, but I am so glad I found it! :)
I have made this blanket two times, each just as simple and easy.  People love it!  Thank you!
What do you do if you have done more than 42 stitches
I could NOT find a 11.5 mm so got a 10. Starring tonight :)
Sos
I cant find the about box
But good
I carnt find the about box
Do You have any suggestions for a border? I made a baby blanket and I would like to add a border to dress it up a little. Everything I try seems to bulky because the yarn is so thick. Thank you so much, Leni
That blanket is so easy to make thank you. It was taking me ages to do my hard way thank you so much.
this was so easy to make and I have been through like 20 videos and yours was the easiest thanks so much.
I cannot seem to find the about box
I just started crocheting this year and I am 13, I made many hats, a scarf, and I am in the process of making another blanket, and I sometimes get lost when watching a tutorial but you made it very easy for me to follow.
About how long did it take you to make this blanket?
I am having trouble at the end of the row. It doesn't seem straight. I put it thru the top stitch and chain 3 and turn but when I look at it seems not straight. What am I doing wrong and have a cheap P hook seems hard to work with.
Nice :-)
I like this pattern!!!! Using 4ply wool and a 6mm hook.....Looking pretty good so far, possibly will work as a nice summer baby throw :)
I had a hard time using the P hook as it did not move easy. I bought a package with two and can't tell which one is the P hook and which one is the Q hook  by Boye one is long and one is shorter. Why is it that using a larger hook seems so hard.
Just finished my blanket and absolutely love it! Thanks for all the great tutorials Melanie!
This is a super easy blanket to make. I have been crocheting for years and it was easy to follow the video. However, for someone that has not been crocheting for a long period of time I feel like it would be to fast for them. You are very thorough but I would suggest to slow down for the beginner. Very good video though.
thank you so much for showing its hard with one hand to find stuff too do this is easy for me i am makeing one right now thank you
I love this
I do not see the about more information.
I have the same size yarn but my biggest needle is 8mm I am new at this so how would I measure the chain? Longer or shorter?
Thank you for making this video .it was so easy to follow.Instead  bulky yarn I used 2 strands of thinner yarn.♥
thank you for sharing this great video. i crochet my first single and double stitch. I went a little wrong at the start when you stitch three then turn i turned it too soon but soon figured it out. thank you.
I just love your videos. I was just wondering if I used two strands of yarn at the same time and a size 10 hook would this pattern still work? Thanks again
How long should this take you? I have been working on it for over a month and it is taking me FOREVER!
never crochet a day in my life. tomorrow i'm going to give this ago and will update when i have finished this project. I am going to make a dolls blanket for my little girl as a tester so i can have a little practice before i crochet some throws. thank you for sharing these great videos
Where I find the about?
It's so easy but the 2nd time I made it -it was easier than the first time. The only question I got is how do you keep your edges so straight
Is there anyway  to fix my terrible  tension issue?
Im 12 i love 2 so things with yarn and i started to a blanket a while ago and i cant remember how to do the edges its so confusing but FUN B-)B-)B-)B-)B-)
Melanie I love your videos and they are easy to follow. I actually just finished my first baby blanket. So easy and fun thank you! But I was wondering if maybe you can make a video on how to make a baby blanket with fabric on one side of the crochet blanket. I see them every where but I can't find a good video that actually teaches you how to make them. Thanks!
how do I get a copy of this pattern?
I started  to  make both kids there own blanket got a month into it,and gave up. But i really  wanted them to have a blankey i made so i looked up how tos, thank goodness  you  put these  videos up cuz i seen yur video an i went out baught the stuff an i am in the  process of making my sons blanket. I have messed up but my son said its perfect an dont fix it. THANK YOU SO MUCH!
This blanket was sooooooo easy......, I love your videos
Hi Melanie I can't believe how simple and fun this project is.  I guess at 56 I can stll learn something new. lol tks
thank you now I made a blanket for my grandbaby
I AM 11 YEARS OLD I MADE THIS FOR MY LITTLE SISTERS BIRTHDAY PRESENT THANK YOU SHE LOVED IT AND EVERYBODY SAID CAN YOU MAKE ME 1 CAN YOU MAKE ME ONE AND ALL I SAID WAS I GOT IT FROM AN AMAZING YOUTUBE VIDEO THANK YOU VERY MUTCH MY SSTER LOVES HER BLANKET
Help, I didn't understand how you end.  Can you help me with that?
This is my first blanket to crochet and you say the final blanket is 31 x 35.  When you chain 42 at the beginning, should the length of that chain be 31 inches?
Thank you Melanie!  I just finished the afghan I made for my sister. This was so easy.  I can wait to try some other projects.  I'm llooking forward to learning to crochet from some of your other videos.  With Blessings, Joy
You did not show how to finish the blanket, for a beginner I don't know and I don't want to leave a lose end.
Hey! I love this blanket! I've made it twice. Im a super beginner and i find your tutorials the easiest to follow and best quality.  Can you please show me how to add a border to this blanket?  I would really appreciate it!!!
Can you please do a video on how you set up your camera because I want to make crochet videos and i have the perfect desk for it but i don't know the best way to set up my camera and be able to work with out troubles.
I just bought this same blanket in blue but the sales associate didn't tell me I need a 11 hook and I bought a pack of crochet hooks from 3-6.5. Would the 6.5 work for this project?
Thank you so much for this tutorial! I didn't pay enough attention about what you said  how to make edges nice straight in the beginning. Im more the half way through already. do u have any idea how can I fix it? thanks
Can you put a border around this blanket and if so what kind?
Nice channel! Very nice! I subscribed, if you could please subscribe to my crochet channel too, thanks!
I assume my 6.5mm hook would be too small for this? Would I just counteract this by chaining more and doing more rows? I want the same look but fear the smaller hook may make it too tight - would I be right? (Sorry I'm fairly new to crocheting).

Hi Melanie! Just wondering why you went into the stitch when turning over the first time (2nd row), then went into the larger holes when turning over every other time? just want to make sure I do this right! thank you for this beautiful blanket tutorial! p.s. you used Baby Peach color right? I got the same b/c it's different then pink for baby girl, but looks somewhat orangy in real life! ha! thank you again!  💗
Hi I'm nine and this tutorials is easy to understand and it is fun to make
This was my first crochet project, and it was very easy and fun.  I am trying to attach a photo per your request; although, I am having difficulties doing that.  Maybe you should post a video for us to learn that as well. lol. signed computer challenged.
I love working on this blanket. If I wanted to make this blanket for my 13 yr old 5'9 daughter, how many balls of yarn would I need when doing a foundation chain of either 60 or 72?
super new to this, I am just getting to understand what the lingo is, So what If I wanted to make a REALLY big blanket I was going to chain around 150 what number of chains would work???
I have started this blanket over.  Instead of crocheting 42 for the chain I did 52.  It looks much better and it wider.  Can I make this blanket as long as I want.  Also what kind of border can I put on it.
Hi Melanie, I have a question, can I make a cream border on this blanket? I am using the same yarn in Blue and would like to create a border in white or cream. Is that possible?
i am so confused...maybe i'm just dumb haha
Beautiful blanket. Nice tutorial.
Thank you for an easy, beautiful afghan. What kind of border would you suggest?
Looking for an oven mitt tutorial ... I thought in crochet with t shirt yarn. Do u v any idea?
Hi ive done this twice now I keep slanting on one side only so counted holes and there getting less as its getting longer dnt know wat im doing wrong plz help x
Would it look good if I used red heart yarn with a 10 mm hook?
omg this was just so horrible idk what the hell she was saying 100% of the time I can't im so mad haha
this was so hard I literally cried in frustration I thought this was for beginners but this is like for advanced people I quit I'll just pay someone to make me the blanket
I am making this baby blanket and I was just wondering....it doesn't seem to be very wide.  Is this ok for a new born baby up to about 6 months.  I am going to be a great grandma for the 2nd time in September.  I have never made this stitch before and it was very easy to follow your video.  I just love it!
Hi. I just finishes this blanket and my measurement are only 27x35. It doesn't seem wide enough. Is there some way I can make it wider?
n  you help me i am using a 10 mm hook/N hook it does not look right im not using the same yarn as you but it does not look right
You look beautiful and your blanket is beautiful also.
Love it going to make one this weekend
Could I use the same stuff except with the adult blanket yarn from the same brand, to create a large one to lay on a couch or something? Would 4 large balls of yarn work for that if I doubled the measurements?
Hi Melanie, that is an awesome video !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i immediately worked on one for my lil girl, i donno how can i download it to show u. I m starting another one for my 2nd daughter and i followed ur advise on using the multiples of 6 (48) but i ended up short in one stitch :( what shall i do??
I was wondering, how much could you do for the regular size yarn like not the jumbo one. Or is the one you are using the regular? I'm so confused about those I hope you help me out on this!
So I used Bernat Baby Blanket Super Bulky (6) 100g (is this the problem?) and when I finished the entire ball of yarn, it definitely was not that big. Am I doing it too tight maybe?
Super Easy, love it.  My kids and their friend all want one... Great tutorial, well done.
I could only find the 100g 3.5oz skeins... would 3 of those be equivalent to what you made or did you use two 300g skeins (600g total)?? Thanks
ses  un  beau  point
I made this for my grandson. He absolutely loves it. Thank you for the easy instructions!
Love this blanket and going to start one today.  How can we print the directions out to give friends?  I can't seem to find anything.
My blanket didn't come out like urs what am I doing wrong ? How do I post a photo?  My squares are bigger  I used the same yarn as u and the same crochet size hook
Im ten and I started to crochet when I was 8 years old. This orject was very easy and super quick!  Please do more tutorials like this!
Hi  I want to make a baby blanket how many yarns should I use ?
save and help me !!!!!
hello my name is Daysha !! I love watching ur videos.!! I think I messed up somewhere my blanket is turning what am .I doing wrong and how can I fix it without starting over  please please b
I can not find the big balls any where!  The color I want is sold on all the online retailers.   Can I just use the smaller skeins and buy more of them?
Thank you very much. Your video was very easy to follow, even for beginners like myself
Hi, what can I do if I running out of yarn while I am working on a project?  Can not find the same brand yarn. pls comments.
I think I did something wrong.. when I pull the blabket, it is turning a little.  Maybe I am making one more stitch? Do you know I can correct it from here on so I don't have to redo the whole thing?
Sorry but this is dumb
How do you skip loops but not make the blanket uneven
I was given a big ball of yarn. Super bulky 6, and 10.5 oz in weight. This will be enough for the blanket or will i need more.
You keep talking about checking the "about" box for more info on the yarn and project. I am not seeing this box at all.
Awesome,  love it , I m gonna make it defiantly .. I never did this kind a work but your videos are very appealing . Very easy n biggner friendly.
I wanted to ask, I want to make this since it is very simple, but I am not a fan of "thick" blankets. I prefer either comforters or thin blankets. I was wondering if it would mess up the design at all if I try to crochet it with thin thread? If so I understand, thank you!!!
I really enjoyed watching your tutorial. It was my first time using the Bernat yarn, but I enjoyed it way more. I would like to know how to attach a fabric to the underside of the bkanket.
Thank you for making this video! I am 12 and I just started crocheting. My mom is going to have a baby and I am going to make this blanket for my new sibling! Thanks so much!
High I want to make this for my sisters birthday. She is 65 and gets cold. I am going to use Red heart super saver yarn and a 6.5 hook will that work? I just started crocheting this looks easy enough I hope LOL. What do you think. Can't wait to get some more tutorials.
Can you do this project with a thinner yarn? I had already purchased Bernat Pipsqueak with intentions of making a blanket for my nephew. The ball is 100g/ 3.5 oz and I'm using a 5.5 m needle.
Stop swallowing into the mic
I am VERY new at this whole crocheting thing so this might be a silly question; Is it possible to make this blanket with thinner yarn and a smaller crocheting hook? I know I will have to crochet a much longer foundation chain to make it big enough to be a blanket, but I am not sure whether or not this technique will work in a smaller scale:)
I made 2 small crochet curtains (obviously with the same number of rows), however one of them came longer than the other. Can someone explain to me what I could have done wrongly?
At the ends, are you putting that 1 DC in the back loop only of that top stitch or back and front loops?
Do you have any tutorials for large blankets? I would like to make something for my queen size bed.
What a wonderful introduction to crocheting for someone who is a novice!  Your video was extremely user friendly!  Please let me know how to finish the blanket and secure the wool so it can be washed.
I love this pattern and Bernat Blanket Yarn. Since Oct 2014 I've made 6 afghans!!! It goes so fast. I get a lot of compliments. Thanks for posting. Last night I started my 7th one. Love, love, love. Hope Bernat comes out with more colors.
I want to make mine more toddler sized. Would 2 balls of the Bernat baby blanket yarn be enough?
I am very excited to use this pattern to make a christening blanket for my soon to be goddaughter :)
Just finished mine.. Love..
If I do two or more levels it shrinks PLZ help me plz
Thank you so much  I found the little arrow with the information. I'm new to YouTube and is learning how to navigate the site. Thanks again
This tutorial was very easy but I'm having a problem finding the box with the information. You said it's right below can anyone tell me what it is near.
I love how you inspire so many young people to start crocheting it's amazing
Video was too fast! Couldnt accually see what you were doing:(
How long did this take
Instructions
when you start the second role you go a little fast and i get lost and it never seems to look right after a few roles and i need your help to get this right.
Love ur videos
Can you hi a bit slower next time
Just finished this baby blanket for a gift. Very easy instructions to follow. It is only my second crochet project.
TO MAKE A BLANKET FOR A NEW BABY GIRL HOW MANY  BRADES SHOULD I MAKE BECAUSE 42 IT LOOKS VERY SMALL. I THINK 100 SHOULD BE ENOUGH. PLEASE CAN YOU ANSWER ME BACK. THANK YOU
What you did around 2:03 is a complete mystery to me! I've watched at least a dozen times and I can't tell if you did a stitch or if the yarn slipped off your hook?
hi im making this blanket and I was wanting to find out how I would adjust the blanket to make a lap blanket I chained 42 stitches how many more stitches would I need to add the 42 stitches are to small I need to add more how many more would I add to make this blanket right please right back asap
this is awesome! what colour did you use for this blanket?
http://instagram.com/p/yiDYPlOWOF Here's the picture of the blanket I just finished.
Hi- Bought some Bernat yarn on sale and have not known what to make with it until I came across your tutorial. Thanks whipped up quickly.
So I hadn't crocheted in years and made one for my pregnant cousin. Super easy and fun... the first few rows were hard but this is my new favorite past time. Thanks so much!
I can not find the printed instructions for this blanket
Can u post a pic of how big the blanket is like infront of u so we can see visually how big it is
Pregnant sister wants some crochet baby ballet slippers can't find any good patterns that we like any suggestions?
I LOVE YOU AND YOUR VIDEOS!;):) hope you reply!:P
So I messed up and have been doing two DC's at the end of each row instead of one. I'm about a third of the way done. Is this going to cause a big problem? I really don't want to pull all of that out and start over. :)
I can't see how many yards of yarn are in a spool.  I could only find 86 yards a spool.  Do I still use 2?
Great tutorial! I was able to make my dog a cozy blanket in about three hours!!! Thank you!
Love this! Been working on it today and It's beautiful :) Thank you!
When I first tried this I had only been crocheting for 2weeks and I'm 11 so it looked like a dreadlock  and I think 42 was not enough so I made it 200 and now it looks better thank you for this tutorial it really helped! :-)
Will a K needle be okay for this project because that's what the skein calls for and that's what I bought. I have others but they aren't cushioned and I have arthritis. If not I will wait and buy the right size later.
Wonderful demonstration tutorial. Loved it and I am definitely going to use what I just learned from your tutorial. Thank you so very much for taking the time to share your talent and knowledge with us. Sincerely Tina Lynn B
I love the blanket. It looks beautiful.
Thanks for sharing this simple  pattern . I had to be about  10  when I last  did this with  my Grandmother  and Auntie .This refreshed my memory especially how to  keep the ends straight  and  turning  to make the next row   ♥
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!! I'm 26 yrs old. I worked at Michael's arts and crafts for 6 yrs and learned how to knit. But when I tried to learn how to crochet it was very difficult. But this video help. I'm making a blanket for my newborn niece right now!
Hi, Melanie! I'm working on my 2nd blanket following your tutorial. The first baby blanket ended up quite beautiful though I did have some trouble with the edges/sides.  Now, I'm trying to make a blanket for myself, I've made a 120 stiches foundation chain and I'm having trouble with the edges/sides, they seem to increase and instead being a rectangle the blanket looks like a parallelogram. Qustion: Should each row have the same amount of double stiches as the previous one? Can you tell me what is it that I'm doing wrong? Thanks a lot!!!!
thank you and  God bless you
Hi, I am new to crochet and thought I would try this as my first project.  Could I use a 15mm hook? Many thanks Sam
I can't find the measurements
Hi I loved your crochet blanket Hope to make one soon too thanks
Hi there love you videos  they are very helpful. My Grandmother showed me how to crochet when I was little but got out of it. Now with your help I'm doing it in remembrance of her. I couldn't find any yarn in 10.5 Oz. So i got 8 Oz. How long should I make the base to start with.
Where did you purchase that measuring device?
I made this blanket and would Like to know is there any way I can make it wider?? I'm new at this..lol
I luv ur blanket
Love this video it is very begginer friendly very easy and using this thick yarn was such a good idea love it now all my friends want one;-)
what a beautiful baby blanket!! Did you say how many rows?
Hi I had a request I am a beginner and want to learn how to make a simple triangle poncho but can't find any video to make one and I love how you explain it :) would be very grateful if u can make A video
Do you think doing this in two colors would look good?
Need a simple  pattern for a headband..love your patterns. twinsc110@comcast.net.
This has been a perfect project for me. I have nerve damage in my neck so the bigger hooks and yarn is much easier for me and less painful. I could only find the small skeins 86 yds and 3.5 oz so I have 5 of them and different colors. Really hope it turns out decent for my newborn in June :-)
Just love your patterns. You explain the instruction perfectly. I'm 81 with low vision and am able to crochet along with you.
I have done several of your projects all are great.  But I can't seem to get the dc right.  Any suggestions?  I have had to redo my blanket 10 times and it looks nothing like yours.
If I wanted the blanket to be wider, how much would I need to chain?
Visit! ljiljalila.blogspot.com﻿
To make it an adult blanket how many chains would you have to make and how many balls of yarn would you need?
Hey Melanie would you suggest this is where I should start if im a beginner at this?  or would you suggest I did something else?
I loved this video I am 11 and have made projects that were harder to follow thank you for creating this video and I loved your infinity scarf video
What a great and easy pattern!  I will not only make blankets with this pattern but I will also use it to make scarfs and try to make a shawl. Thanks for posting it.
Did the whole 1st row and there were no holes to go into? Could i have gone too tight? or what is happening?
I don't know why, but I'm not understanding how to add a second ball of yarn. When I tie the two ends together, I don't understand how I'm supposed to continue.
Love the idea so simple I got it, But I got puzzled I chain 42 I grabbed measure tape it measure 24 inches? What am I doing wrong? Is possible I use the N-10mm hook??? Need help asap

I love these videos!! My Gram taught me when I was very little  and I hasnt done it in soo long until just last year. You are so amazing for refresher thing. Question though . I have a 7 year old left hander . I am right handed how do I teach him. he is really interested  thanks soo much for all of your help!!!
I want to make this for my 7 year old! And maybe one for me....
Super excited to try this! Thanks for the simple instructions.
Hi my name is susan . Love your videos .I am making the begginningers blanket .I having poles with the other side of the blanket it keeps curling up .how can I stop that from happening . Please let me know thank u . A big fan .
Love it
Do you have any other ways of doing a baby blanket that is tighter together but not to hard??
this was a great video and was easy to follow. i will continue to use this pattern for all blankets using this thicker yarn. i also used this yarn to make a nice thick winter scarf. I just chained 15 and then double crocheted back and forth to the length i wanted. thanks again!
Can you use thinner yarn for this blanket?
This really is the best crochet blanket ever !  Its soooo easy and the video was great keep up the awesome job!
What am I doing wrong?  On the first row, mine keeps curling up.  I have tried it several times now.  Will it straighten out after a few more rows??
😱Not easy at all. And too fast !
thanks a lot for this video.........i was able to learn and ended up up a throw pillow cover lol.......
Hi happy new year to you, I have a question although tried a blanket and Im a like 2 week in beginner, I've made 3 infinity scarves but they all came out twisted, would you explain why?
I started to crochet when I was 7 in 1st grade and have been crocheting since since!I am 9 right now!!
I dont understand  what u mean by" make sure your foundation chain is in multiples of 6 (60,66,72,etc)"
I wish it was slower I had to stop and start it a million times I have never crochet before I gave up for now will try again later
If I use a smaller yarn will I need to use more then two balls of yarn? Or would it be the same ?
I love the baby blanket pattern. I have just made my first crochet baby blanket I use Bernet Blanket Yarn it is so so soft and it was easy following your video. Thanks for all you do.
Can I made a baby hat with the same yarn? If so what size needle would you recommend
I have question why does my crochet blanket curve on the sides
Can you try to make a c2c baby blanket
Hi, Thank you so much for this, it was so enjoyable. I felt like a real pro (which I'm not). I only started it on the day my sister was due to have her first baby! But you saved the day with this speedy design and now it's ready and waiting for her late arrival :-)Thanks again, Caroline
Thus was a great step by step instruction
Sorry it is outoccorecting and I'm trying to fix it
People think croche is fol old people and not fon or useful but it is
SO every time i make a new line it keeps getting longer and longer is there a way i can just add to the shorter lines without unraveling the whole blanket?
Love it. Making the blanket now. Great instructions.
I LOVE this blanket! This is my very first project and I'm almost done! Love this yarn! I'd like to add a border, maybe scalloped. Is it possible to do with this blanket and could you provide instructions. Also, would it be beginner friendly? Thank you again for this awesome blanket!
I just finished my first project! Thanks for your easy to follow tutorial. I am working on an adult sized throw now, using these instructions.
I see that the finished blanket measures are 31 x 35. Is that size big enough for a 6 year old? How would you modify the pattern to make it bigger? I'm working on it now and it doesn't seem wide enough.
I am 10 I started crocheting for a few days and I luv this project it was SUPER easy
Plse do corner to corner blanket
I just don't understand other people I caught on to your so quick how do u do a single and a triple plse show me
I love this video. I made it not as a baby blanket, but for me!!!!!
awesome video  thanks for posting it  i will be looking for more of your tutorials
Well +naila garrett that's exactly what I did for your info. And why are you even replying to my comments for 1 I don't know you and 2 why are you even replying to my comment it wasn't for you to respond to so naila I'm asking nicely for you to not respond to my comments again.
Horrible!! I'm a 10 year old girl and this is my first time trying. I couldn't even get passed the first part where you do the chain. You said you would go slow but instead obviously you were going to fast for a child llike me
I love this! I am just starting to learn. Got some tools for christmas! looking forward to making this for my best friends first child! :) Thank you so much for this video. You made it look easy to follow.
Thanks! I am a new crocheter...thanks for the tutorial
This could be really offensive, but I don't mean it to be.  I just wanted to suggest that when recording your videos you really watch the smacking and mouth noises.  A pretty large portion of the population suffers from Misophonia, including me.  I'd love to learn to crochet using this video because you show the stitches very well, and you explain it so well, and you have such pretty hands, but the mouth smacking causes such irritation and I have no control over it.  I turned the volume almost all the way down to see if I could still hear your words but not the smacking and it didn't work.  I realize this is a weird issue and it's MY issue, not yours, but I'm not alone.  Just wanted you to know.  :)
If I wanted to make this using Light yarn how many stitches should I have in my foundation chain?
I like the tutorial but I find my stitches are not looking like yours. I can't seem to correctly count to see what stitch goes where. This is a beginners tutorial so I was disappointed to see that it wasn't explained which stitch we go through, the top or bottom. And or what the difference is.
I might be doing like one extra step or taking extra yarn somewhere because im using the exact same yarn as she is jusy different color :(
Thank you for an amazing video. You explained it superbly and i loved it... Thank you!!
I. LOVED. IT. Thank you so much for this tutorial, this helped very much. As I have only started crocheting 2 days ago and all I've made is a single crochet heat cloth, and a double crochet scarf that I finished a couple of hours ago! I ran out of yarn and now I know what to make after I get more yarn!  I subscribed, x Thanks for the help!
Hello! I first want to say i love ur videos but i am a beginner ar chrochet and i have one question.  In your video you say shpw your blanket when you have used one skeen of ball. I have everything you have done but my blanket is way smaller using just o e ball of yarn. Why is that, im using two pks od yarn and i get half of what you get just using one... please help ,  And thank you for sharing.
or u can add me at june june
I learned how to crochet thanks to this tutorial!!!
hi, may I have your facebook account ? tq
Do you like using plastic hooks? Which type is your favorite?
I just watched your video.  It's amazing how easy crocheting the blanket was.  I did a practice one because I only have regular yarn.  My practice blanket turned out extremely nice.  I am so impressed.  Now, I am confident that I can do the blanket I want for my first grandchild whose due on Christmas.  It really doesn't take long at all.  I expect after I get the materials, I'll be done in a day.  I also used a K needle.  I can't wait to get started!  It took less than an hour to complete 12 rows. Thank you.
This is not beginner friendly =(
I love all your videos and hope you can do a video on a crochet poncho
WOULD it be able to be a ice pack rap
I loved this video!
mell this is just a great video your instruction works well.
thanks I'M A beginner and that's really easy
Am sorry but this is not easy or for beginners. U didn't even show how to do a slip knot or the first pattern is supposed to go 😒
this is beautiful. im making my husband a red white and blue blanket. changing colors when one color is getting close to running out. i love the stitch. it is turning out real nice. thank you for posting this video.so pleased how this is turning out. thank you
¡me encanta! es hermosa! gracias! :)
I love this I'm ten and I'm making this for my kg doll and I love it I made a little bigger
You go too fast !
Hi i love watching your videos on the crocheting projects. And im actually thinking on making this blanket for my husbands coworker who just found out shes pregnant. But he gave me an idea for the colors since we dont know what shes having yet im making it neutral colors which he suggested green, yellow, and white. But is it easy to switch between two colors to give a striped look to the blanket and then put the last color around the edge as a border? Can this pattern have a border? Also what type of pattern would work for a border for this blanket? Im still learning to crochet certain things but i know the basics and can follow patterns pretty well ive been crocheting for almost two years now. So any suggestions you can give will help. Thank you.
I have to say this video was great for learning to make a blanket. I've wanted to learn for in the future when I have kids or if I want to make something for someone. I would recommend though to slow down the video for beginners like myself because i was having a bit of a hard time following the double crochet with this bigger yarn.
Thank you so much for the wonderful pattern!!
You're right...two days and I finished a beautiful Bernat -burgundy, olive green, and off white lap blanket for my goddaughter!  Thank you for such a quick and easy pattern-can't wait to make another. xo~
This is my first crochet project and so far going great!! Thank you
I have a niece and a close friend both due with boys in March 2015.  I'm making this blanket for both of them.  It's my first ever crocheted blanket.  So easy and fun to make. Thank you for the easy pattern and instructions.
Omg you are so great! Good video, helped me to make my first blanket! :) Thanks so much and you are so pretty, please upload more!:D
I love this! Just found out my friend is having a baby in a month so this is a perfect baby shower present! :)
My blanket isnt right, i started small at first, then it got bigger near the end
The ball of yarn suggest a 6.5mm or k hook will that work
I am having trouble understanding the first few stitches.  I keep going back and reviewing, but I still do not understand.
At the beginning when you did 35, if you were to do  big king size blanket how many would you do && how many yarns do you need?
Great video! If I were to make an adult sized blanket what should my foundation chain be?
love the blanket, i'm trying it right now thank you,by the way do you have a tutotial for baby booties
Hi Melanie. Can you suggest a border for this blanket? I've just finished mine, but I think it would be nice to finish with a nice border. Thank you for your video!
I was wondering if I wanted to make an adult size blanket with this same pattern, what would you recommend for size? How many chains should I do and how many balls of yarn should I use? I'm new to crocheting and haven't really figured out how to make my own patterns that work. Thank you :)
Oh may god thank you so much I just made a beautiful blanket I did my foundation chain a hundred and twenty six stitches and it came out the perfect size with five balls of 355 yards of yarn .... ur amazing
where is the about box?
Hey Melanie. Your stitches look bigger than mine and I have the same yarn and same crotchet hook? Not sure what I'm doing either as this is my first crotchet preject. I'll be waiting to hear from you thanks. :)
I heard that Bernat Baby is 100% polyester. Is this safe to use for a baby born in spring because my dad had said that polyester is plastic. But this is the perfect material for this project
Newbie question, sorry, but after you go to start the row after the first bit of chains, you say to skip four chains then do a double crochet. I get that, but after you do the double crochet, do you skip another four? Or only one chain? This has had me lost haha
can i use a small hook and yarn
Great video and your instructions were so clear they inspired me to take on my first crochet project! I made this in about 3 days and it turned out so well:) Thank you so much!
Thanks for the tutorial. I really appreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedule to show us how to crochet a baby blanket.
Cuz I want like a sleeping sack for my 3 mo baby... Or buttons???
Thanks for all your help!!  I am on Blanket #3
Made this and LOVE IT!!!  Thanks for the pattern and awesome tutorial!
So as im doing my blanket I notice one side of my blanket is on a slant. Do I need to restart? If so what did I do wrong, I've followed the steps and it's not quite working... Thanks!
Yay I just finished this blanket as my first ever crochet project! I had to rip it apart about 5 times at first until I caught on, but in the end it turned out so cute
Thanks for the video, i am in the end of the project, but do not know how to do the slip stitch / knots to secure the last stitch. is doing the slip stitch and weaving the same thing?
Love your video! I'm a super beginner at crocheting, but I have a baby niece that's due in March and want to give her something that she will hopefully keep for forever instead of just buying something. Is the bulky thread easy for a beginner for me or should I just go practice your beginner scarf tutorial?
I made on this but now I have a question, can a zipper be added to this blanket??? Love ur tutorials...
So hard at first then I got the hang of it
My yarn is really thin I'm trying to find really thick yarn but I can't find any
do you have a video of slip stitching or can direct me to a video that will help?
Thank you so much for all your videos... I have done 3 of your patterns that I couldn't have done without your help.  Thank you!!  Keep posting please:)
I will make this for my nephew
If I use a smaller hook will the holes be less open or would you suggest a different style stitch for a 4 mo baby ? Love your easy info as always . Happy Thanksgiving ! Ps I tied knots too when switching yarn over. Hugs
I'm only 8 years old can you make a other vedio a litel slower please I would be really happy :-)
thanks so easy to follow!!! What edging would you recommend?
Can I use a 6.5 mm hook? The baby blanket yarn says its used with 6.5 mm hooks what will change if i use a 6.5mm hook?
I haven't crocheted in over 30 years.  Expecting first grandbaby, I had to try this blanket.  I finished it in less than 3 days. Very easy.  Thank you so much for the tuturiol!!
I can't wait to try this out!
You go so fast I can't get it down :(
I made my first blanket!!! it fits my queen size bed lol, but I actually made it for a Christmas gift! Thanks so much :) How can I upload the pics to show you?
I love your videos!!! They help me so much, being a new crocheter thanks soo much!!
this video was so awesome, I made my first baby blanket
I'll try to make that for my sister
I am doing this project and it's my first one. I've done the foundation chain with 66 to have approx 35" may I kindly ask you how many rows approximately you've done to get 31". with one ball of yarn 100gr bulky 5 I only ended up with 4.5".
Hi, Thank you for this video... it taught me how to crochet. I do have a question... if I am using the same number of chains, why does my price come out smaller??
Can i use a 6mm needle instead of 11.50 mm??
Can I just say that when you are just beginning and learning, where to put what, using this extra large yarn and extra large crochet hook makes it so much easier to learn
Thanks for the very detailed instructions. I made one and it looks so beautiful. I used Bernat pitter patter yarn.
I made this for my new niece and I'm so happy with it!! I've never crocheted before and I found this super easy:) thank you so much for this tutorial I learned a lot!!
Love it and you
I need help, please! I don't quite understand how to end the blanket. How do you make a slip knot and weave the extra piece in without it unraveling? Is it sturdy that way? I'm a super beginner, just saying. Thank you!
I started the first 2 rows but got totally loss on the third row . Do u have a different video that shows this in more detail. I a, unable to see exactly where r u putting the needle thru.. Thanks a lot. This is my first time n would love to make this for my baby girl
i love how you speed up the process and how i can hear your voice clearly
what is a turning chain
So cool! I love crocheting! Can you show a blanket with patterns?
Great Video !!! I recently subscribed and you make all your projects so easy to follow. Thanks I'm starting the blanket in a medium yarn but I will follow your instructions to make sure the foundation chain is in multiple of 6. Again thanks.
Hi, I started the blanket and it's turning out more long and narrow versus square. Is that how it's suppose to look?  I just finished one ball of yarn and it's roughly 18 by 30, and once I add the second ball of yarn, I'm guessing it will be 18 x 60.  Kind of like a table runner instead of square blanket.
Such an easy blanket to make!  Thank you so much for taking a project that was intimidating and making it super fun and easy!  My best friend is going to love this!
I am having a hard time holding my work, and feeding the yarn, any tips or a video?
If I wanted to switch the yarn color for each row how should I go about that?
Well, this was my first crocheting project.  The stitches were easy and I finished, but apparently I did something wrong each time I turned it because its not a rectangle….its more like a trapezoid!  lol  I guess I try again.
Where is the written pattern? Not seeing it
What are the washing instruction for this? I'm planning to make these as Christmas gifts.
I am on my fourth row and my blanket will not lay flat! It's curling up. Will it eventually lay flat or did I make the first chain too tight?
Thank you so much, you are an good teacher. I watched your vid about a week ago an it inspired me to want to try, my Mom use to chrochet but I never learned from her, but after this vid I believe I can do it, I just bought the yarn and hook and I am so excited to be learning something knew. wish me luck :)
Hi how much balls of yarn do I need if I want to make a adult size blanket?
Okay so I love the way this pattern came out butttttt... I have a different kind of yarn and it's light 3. I'm not sure but the yarn is really skinny. I was just wondering if I can still use the same pattern with this type of yarn.
Do you have a video, or can you make one, on how to make a border around a blanket like that?
I'm a newbie to crochet and just finished my blanket :) and it's so cute thanks for the easy to follow video !
I am definitely going to try this but for an adult blanket :)
So when u are finished with the whole thing and length and width u want it at the end u just tie it in knot so it don't come lose right
I'm pregnant with my first child and I found your video to be the simplest to follow. Thank you. I hope my little baby will love it
Can we make it smaller? I didn't get the big balls of yarn
You are awesome. I am coming back to crocheting after 18 years. I defiantly will be subscribing. Thank you.
Thank you for this, I just took my first class and now your video and I'm halfway done with the. Lankey
I wanted to make a full size blanket. I've only really done a single stitch so I'm super excited to try this! How many chains do you think I would need for like a full blanket and how many balls or yarn? I'm not sure how to measure all of this out.
Don't you need to add 3 to the end of the foundation chain?
Hey, I'm almost done with my blanket but noticed that in the 3rd row i made a mistake and did 3 double crochets instead of 2. Is there a way to fix this instead of redoing the whole blanket? :-(
So easy to follow! I am doing one right now with a thinner yarn, and it is turning out very well.
I made two of these for my cousins baby. She loved them!
Thanks so much! I am working on it(:
You go too fast.
This is such a nice stitch. I can't wait to try this with a scarf. I just made a scarf, made it too big, it's kinda like a baby blanket. Just started following you on IG.
I'm new at this & your video helps a lot! Thanks for the great tutorial:)
I must be the only person that cannot do this. No matter how many times I try to, I get 4 mins in compare yours to mine realise how much I've gone wrong and take it apart again.
Am devika from india. U doing a good job I too tried it's came out awesome, thank u, ur fb id
I subscribed because I like your videos. I am going to get this yarn right now and get busy with this blanket.
So I slipped stitched the ends, but what do you mean by tie off your ends then weave it? I can't seem to figure it out... lol
for a adult blanket how many stitches do you uesd
I started making one in yellow it looks nice.
I love this tutorial. I made a blanket on Saturday, although it doesn't look as nice as yours.
How long that takes you to make the blanket.
I'm in process of making a baby blanket like this will it be uneven??
go slower next time but i love ittttttttttttttttttttt.
Hi I made this took me about 5 hours on and off...it came out beautiful and I had extra yarn that I made tassels on top and bottom...But one thing top part is soft and top is stiffer and it's longer on one side?Besides that this is a wonderful tutorial and this is my first crochet♡Thank you
I would like to try to made this..  I do not see the about tab you mention to get the directions ..  can you advise?
Beautiful!
When I crochet the strands are either too loose or too tight. Also my V's in the V stitch don't have a definite V shape. Lol. Should I be doing something different with the baby yarn
I did it and it was fun. Luv it thnks
I'm fairly new at crocheting and I'm using Bernat baby blanket. I'm having a really hard time with my blanket. I am following your instructions but my blanket does not look like yours. Lol I've started over 5 times please help....
Seems really easy enough to do, will try!
i want to make this , but there is no about box's .......please help I need the directions
i have been trying this for HOURS and cannot understand it. im having trouble figuring out which stitches to use as far as the 3rd and 4th. plz help
How do I start a blanket off with 1/9-5.50mm needle
Thank you! I just finished my baby blanket. You rock!
can i use this yarn to make a scarf as well ?
How can you do it.
Help I got to my last row on this baby blanket and realized my beginning stitches had come undone.  Can it be fixed or do I have to start over?
Me encanto el color y el material y se ve muy bonita es súper fácil y rápida mil gracias x compartir q dios te bendiga
Mine keeps bunching up while I'm doing the double crochet! Help please, I'm making this for my niece who should be here any day now so I need to hurry lol
I am a beginner and have had problems following videos but this one is great I have done it with not so thick yarn just to practice and actually make something, so thank you very much! This is great!!
Thank you for this. Its so quick and easy. I wanted to ask is it ok for me to sell the blankets I make using this?
Hi Emily.....where do I find the pattern for this very pretty afghan.  I went to 'About' at the bottom of this page, selected it.  The selection brought me to the page that describes how to create a youtube video.  Sorry..... a little confused about where I can locate the pattern for this blanket.  Can you help? or provide me with the pattern or link to the website with the pattern. Thank you.
Hey there I need some help, so I have been working on this blanket and it's been going fine and I love it so much but I noticed that although I made a lot of chains (in multiples of 6) and my blanket is now ending up smaller (in with) I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong if anyone could please help me I would really appreciate it thank you :)
Can you help me?!? My sides are allllll over the place! I am following the video that your suppose to put 1 double crocht in the 3rd chain.
Could you please tell me where I can find the written out instructions for this?  Thank you.... it's beautiful!!!
Just some feedback. I like how simple this is, but you need to slow down on your videos. You go fast for beginners and you don't show us where to put the hook in which stitch. I tried to do this but it got crooked because I couldn't tell what hole to put what in and by the second chain you changed what hole to put your hook into. So next video please go slow and try not to make sounds with you swallowing during the video it was hard to watch the video without being bothered by that. Thanks!
I reyes but i could never get it im never knitting again😢
I am on my fifth one of these.  This is my favorite style to crochet, and my favorite yarn, it works up so quickly!
i love everything u make =D
Really pretty! Don't understand the thumbs down??? Great project in a pinch. Love it!
You were doing everything too fast. Bad video
Probably the worst 'beginner' video I've seen. You're doing everything way too fast and you're not explaining anything that would help a beginner. Steps were hard to follow even with pausing. Did not help me at all. Blanket looks nice though.
There is no about box.  When I clicked on link for written instructions it jumped to previously written comments
I'm a beginner and I love this blanket and video. I just have one question. My blanket was going so good but then towards the middle it began to narrow. Why would this happen and how can I correct it so it's the same width across? Thanks!!!
Hi Mel that was another beautiful video thank you so much :D I hope you don't mind a little bit of spam but I was just on pinterest and found these baby food feeders and thought I'd like to share them with you all :) http://www.pinterest.com/BrightSparkEnt/kidsme-nursery-and-baby-products-feeders-brushes-a/
I made one for my little cousin Jay
can you suggest a border for this blanket?  I don't like the way the first row looks.
can I make this blanket with the giant blue crochet hook? I believe the size is 15.75mm  if anyone has used that size pl let me know, thanks
I made this baby blanket using the same color as your tutorial!  LOVE IT!!!  going to make more!  What i love is that it is soooo easy and goes so fast.  Giving it away at a Baby Shower this weekend!  Thank you!
your blanket is beautiful I am just trying to learn crochet I find my holes are bigger then your I am using the baby blanket super bulky and 11.5 hook can you tell me what I am doing wrong I really want to learn trying very hard thank you
I made this blanket and the  pattern called for 2 skains of yarn. At the end of 2  skains i found i needed more.  So you should change the amount to 3 skains. Also,  I don't like the way my cast on row  turned out.  Could you suggest a fitting border for this baby blanker?  I love this blanket.   I made mine out of the same yarn but mine is the varagated pink, yellow, baby blue and white.  It is so soft i am going to make 1 for me same day.
Lovely blanket nice to take a try
I love this, thank you for sharing. I have one question, do you need bulky yarn for this project or can you use any type of yarn? Please answer :) I love this project very much :D Again thank you for sharing this!!
wow, this is new for me and I am totally subscribing to your youtube!  but question if I were to make one at least 6-7 ft, how long do you think it'll take me?
I got so excited when you first showed the blanket made from a very soft Chunky yarn; then was so deflated when you gave the skein's label in closeup -- made in China.  Good grief, is there <<nothing>> made for sale in the US that isn't made in China?  sigh.  Still looking, trying to stand strong in my one=person boycott of supporting USA products as much as possible.  Also, it's become very difficult to locate natural fiber yarn & sewing fabric [cannot use any synthetics due to extreme chemical sensitivities] that is affordable, when having to purchase enough to make an entire garment, not just a little hat or scarf or accessory item.
Thanks for the video
i found it really easy i like your way
I have wanted to learn to crochet for a long time…you make it look so easy.  I am going to Joann's today to get yarn to make this.  I will post a pic when I am done.
Can't wait to do this one! TFS 💜😄👍
Why did you do that in Florida
How you finish the blanket? The last "round"... Its my frist project
If u have thin yarn how long redo u have to make the chain
when i look at some of the tatorials i was having a rough time but this help alot😁🌼
I want to learn sooo bad
I am so bummed, I am making this blanket, but the sides are all wavy and not straight... Any suggestions on how to prevent that?
I can get that exact same yarn at Wal-Mart for only 3.99
hoping u answer soon, plz tell me how to attach hood to this blanket......I made a blanket according to your instructions and it turned out very beautiful and was really quick.......but i wanted to attach a hood to it, if possible...........plz help
I love this blanket! I made one for my cousin who just had her baby 2 months ago and then I am currently making one for my 5mo old and now all my friends are asking me to make one for their future babies!! Good thing this is so easy to make!!!
How did u change colors??
i don't know how to crochet but you are awesome and the blanket is so cute, i want it!!
I am just starting out crocheting, and after watching your video, I think I could make this blanket :) I am looking to make a bigger blanket though, I wanted a wider, longer one..more for an adult. Do you know how many stitch/chain I would need for a larger blanket? Thank you :)
Awesome simple and easy to follow video, thanks! We don't have any big skeins available here so I'm using many small ones! Question on washing this blanket, what's the best method for washing/drying?
hi i was wondering if you can make a video of adding a  border around this blanket. Thank You
I see its under " show more " got it thank you .
I love this , but I don't see an " about box ? "
I just completed the entire project. Everything turned out great. I can honestly churn out 3-4 of these in a day for myself and gifts! On to baby booties and the 20 minute newborn crochet beanie video next.
I was so sad I made this blanket and it was so cute and cozy and then I laid it out on the floor and realized halfway up my rows started to decrease :( so I had to take it apart.
Thank you for this tutorial!! I made this with Bernat Blanket Yarn in Sailors Delight (Baby's room is Winnie the Pooh!) http://www.pinterest.com/pin/30399366210432354/
Thanks for the tutorial!  I will be making one this weekend!
I've been trying to keep up with you but it is almost impossible
wow this was a great video i hope that i can get a video of making hearts but not using a needle or a magic circle
You are a life saver! I bought this yarn as I loved the look and feel of it to make a blanket for my first grand baby due in December, I tried both the knit and crochet patterns on the label but could not get it right. Then found your video by chance and voila I am halfway thru my blanket.  THANKS!
Great blanket
@iheartstitching hey im ruby that looks so awesome canot waot to try it! Right at thw begining did u just tie a knot to The p hook?
I don't have a P hook but I have a Q, will that work just as well with this yarn and pattern?
Thanks for you help
I love this!! Do you have instructions for an adult one and how much yarn you would need?
Love the blanket. Going to start one today
can this be made with softer yarn and can you show me what it would look like. email cleger1@gt.rr.com. thanks
Great video. I made my first blanket!
I have just finished making this blanket-my first ever crochet project. Thank you so much for making this video so clear and simple to understand! I couldn't get the Bernat yarn in the UK so used James C Brett Flutterby yarn instead. I'm hooked on crocheting now! :-)
Hi dere, this is a beautiful blanket u have made. i wanted to make smthing like dis for my sister's baby.......but m a total total beginner, although i have made a blanket but plz tell me how to end it nd how to make a beautiful border for it.........m really confused
I'm sorry of you said answered this but I need to know what the difference is between 100g and 300g? I like my supplies to be exact but they didn't have a 300g yarn at my store so I bought 3 100g of the baby yarn. Will it make a difference :/ or will it not come out as thick as yours look. ?
i saw this video you made and got the yarn, finished it in almost a weekend - very easy, very soft.  i'd post a pic for you but i don't know how to do that on here.   thanks for sharing and doing a great tutorial.  :o)
thank you so much I cant wait to give it to my baby any day now
Can u use thin wool

Great Tutorial! I'm going to try to make this today! Thank you for making it so beginner friendly :)
Thank you for helping me learn to crochet , I've watched lots of videos and your style off teaching was very clear to understand !!!!
i am a new beginner at crocheting!! i ABSOLUTELY LOVE it!!! i am trying to crochet this blanket for my 1st grandbaby! :) i do have some questions...when i am at the end of my yarn,  how do i start in with more yarn? My blanket is curly when it is suppose to be straight. How do it get it straight across? thank you so much!
I love this pattern! i used it with a different kind of yarn and it was really small! But i am going to  get this yarn and try again!
When I was young, my grandma tought me how to crochet and I remember mine would always curve and form hats lol. Anyway I don't know what nade me think of crochet but here I am watching your outstanding video which helps me remember more.
What kind of edging can be put around this blanket to give it more finished look?
Super cute, i have a question. I have a blanket that is 63 x 78 inches and i would like to crochet that same amount. Can i still do this pattern and how many chains and rows do i need to do ?

I've been trying to figure out how to crochet an edging in single crochet around the sides but can't get it to come out even. Any suggestions?
Love this!!  Just finished one . . . used three skeins of this same type of yarn and used an L size hook.  Fabulous!!  Thanks for the easy instructions!!
I am a beginner and cant wait to make this blanket! Just one question! Would this blanket look good with the yarn that has three colors on it. Just curious
Hi, another Australian here! I am wanting to try this blanket but unsure of the yarn and hook size to use. Here we use ply as the size with worsted weight equating to 10-12 ply yarn, would this be suitable or would you need a larger size? Also what hook size? Thanks!
This is actually coming out good for a beginner like me. Thanks for the easy follow along. After completed, does it hold up to being washed regularly?
Luv, luv, luv it. I have RA an this is very joint friendly!!!
Thanks so much:) I'm only 11 and I made this for my little cousin
Hi. Melanie   Trying to get you on FB not having any luck on that. :( can you send me your FB link so I can request you or like your page. Or You can try to get me on FB Jeanette Rios Rivera or Jeanette's BOWtiques   Love your blanket I'm crocheting one right now.  Thanks  Jeanette :)
TOOK 4EVER THO
Very easy ,thankyou ! It maybe just me , but the sound of u swallowing really is quite loud , sort of , was waiting for u to do it next !
best blanket and video eva! HOLAAAAAA
Thanks so much this was an easy blanket to make. It took me a couple of tries but I got it. I used size N needle and four balls of 100g/ 3.5oz yarn   http://instagram.com/p/sRTMsGK70n/
I am a true beginner and am not familiar with the crocheting lingo.  What is a slip stitch and how do I make one when I finish the blanket?  I want to make sure it is secured when finish and doesn't unravel.  Thanks!
Love this easy blanket, its so fast too!
I am going to start working on this blanket tonight I have a coworker who is pregnant and she will enjoy this. Thanks for the video. =)
this is great I am a beginner and also left handed this seems pretty simple but want to get familiar with other stiches before I attempt this ..... is there any videos you can recommend for left handed beginners
Hi I wanted to try this but what would be the equivalent of a size P/11.5 crochet hook as can't find this in the UK?  Thanks x
awesome
This pattern is super easy! I have never crocheted anything in my life and after 1 hour of watching videos of basic stitches I was able to make this in 2 nights. I used a smaller yarn and more foundation chains to make it longer since it was a smaller yarn but it came out really nice. EASY!
Thank you. I am making this blanket right now. Very easy to follow.
Love this
I want to make this for a twin size bed, how many balls of yarn should I buy?
I'm having a winter baby and I was just wondering if a slightly smaller hook would work so the spaces are smaller? It gets pretty cold up here in central Canada lol
My name is melany too this blanket is sups cute
Hi have you ever done this in a thinner yarn and smaller hook? If so do you have a picture of what it should look like? What's the name of this pattern?
I plan on making this for my niece. What are the measurements when its done? X" by X"?
I will be making one of these for my new great-niece that was born last week. Can't wait to get to the store and buy me some yarn!
I think I must be doing something wrong - I only got about 7 rows out of one ball of yarn, so much smaller than yours... What am I doing wrong?  :(
TFS!  Love this easy pattern and looks great!  I have a friend who just had a baby girl and even though I just made her a mini photo album, I am going to go and get some of this pretty wool and make her this blanket.  Again, thank you!
Will 7oz 198g 364yds red heart super saver work?
Hi, Its my first time trying to do this... its for my 1st baby, what do you think would be a decent size for a newborn baby? will the 42 foundation chain, 2 balls of yarn be enough because I don't want it to be to small!!
I am a newbie to crochet. I was just doing single crotchet because I was afraid to do anything else but you made this so easy to follow and I can't believe I'm actually doing this.... Loving my blanket THANK YOU!!!
Can yarn size 5 and hook size 10mm work the same for this project as I cdnt find yarn size 6 in chenille and hook size 11.5mm isnt available here.
Love your videos
Just started mine, can't wait to share the finished product with you!!
I was looking for something cool ! Thanks a lot . . .
My crochet hook is 4.5 is that ok
You went so fast in the beginning :(
I was wondering  if you could add a border around this type of blanket, just wondering .... I finished this blanket and it's so pretty but I would like to add to it.
Hi!  I've tried this blanket a number of times and one edge is always uneven.  I'm confident I'm following the instructions, but I'm wondering if I'm not getting the right number of v's into my foundation row, and that's affecting the following rows.  Assuming the foundation row is 42, what is the right number of v's for the first row?  I feel like I need to be counting as I'm a beginner.  Thanks so much!  I love the yarn, love the pattern, and am hoping I can get it right on the next try!
I made one of these and somehow I feel like I didn't do it right it was quick and easy but I used 4 rolls of yarn to get it a good size for my niece otherwise it was we too small for even a newborn thanks for the video it helped tramendously
I have already made 2 of these, one baby and one adult throw size.  I can't tell you how much I love working with this yarn, and this style.  Thanks!
Id like to make your baby blanket but here in Australia we have differant sizing (Aust/UK). In your comments you said 11.5 mm or P hook, I tried to find the convertion on line and some say 10mm, can you tell me what I should be looking for.
Very nice blanket...so quick and easy! Thank you!
Hi  I have been trying to crochet this blanket but when I reach row three I can't identify the 'v' stitch u refer to. When on row 3, do I crochet 3 single chains, skip first chain and then 2 dc in the hole/gap between the lower row's dc?   Hoping you can help. Looking forward to crocheting this baby blanket :)  Thnx
If you make this bigger would you start your dc in the fourth chain
I gave you a shout out. Thanks again for the awesome tutorial! http://youtu.be/mLF0MSUgjzA
Can you use a different yarn and hook size?
I am about to attempt this as my first crocheting experience! I am in Australia and we can't get the Bernat blanket yarn here. Can you suggest an alternative?
Just finished this in just over a day.  It's my new favorite pattern.  I must be a tight crocheter  as I had to chain 54 to make it 31" x 36".
Smh you went to fast for a beginner ma'am!
Smh you went to fast for a beginner ma'am!
How much does yarn cost (I'm new)
Hi, this Hannah I am 10 years old and love to crochet. This looks like a simple thing to work on. Thank you for new work!
I think I will try this! I'll send my pic once I'm done!
You can respond me in three years if you want to 😳🙀😞
Hi where can I buy this wool from plz
I've been working on this blanket, but I think I am doing something wrong.  The bottom is wider then the top.  Is it because I messed up somewhere? Or could it be because my stitches have gotten tighter?
I followed your pattern for a larger blanket and it turned out beautifully! Thanks for making this video.
I just finished making this blanket but I made a mistake on the ends.  I didn't chain up two at the end of each row and just discovered the mistake while watching another of your videos.  Just the same I love it and now my daughter wants one for herself because this one is for my grandson who is 23 months old and LOVES blankets!  Would post a picture but have been having difficulty doing it.
Very helpful!  When I'm done I'll send a photo
Cool
I made this and love it! Great first project and it only took me two evenings!
Made this in a few hours. It looks great.
Made this in a few hours. It looks great.
How do you do a slip knot
What do u mean multiples of 6.... Iam a beginner.
Hi, I love your crochet videos. I'm trying to find a cute pattern for a tote bag. Can't find one I like. Could you make a video for that. thank you
Baby blanket looks really beautiful````!!! I will try to make one. Thanks for the information, great video and good easy instructions~~~!
I can't find where you said to look for measurements. Can't find your website for the written pattern either. Would you please email me. Lmlovland@hotmail.com
Thank you. Most tutorials go so fast and miss stitches.  This one was perfect for beginners!
I just wanted to say thank you I have been looking for an easy tutorial to learn how to crochet, and almost all of them say easy yet aren't but yours totally is and it was very helpful when you said pause when you thought a beginner and you left enough space so so done could pause just thank you so much :)
Is there a stitch that looks like you knitted it but you actually crocheted it?
This is too hard for me and I'm only 11 and I failed at doing the slip not... I suck at every thing
not nas easy as thought fun but mnedium like causer im a starter / begginner  but its beatiful and i got it
I can use a k/101/2-6.50mm the differences will be that it would be tighter right.
So I had a question. I got two 86 yrds similar to the one you used but in a different color.  & I have k/101/2-6.50mm whould that be good?
Where is the "about box"??
This is grate thank you
Can you knitt because I like knitting more than crochet
Hi, I am actually making this right now....just a small question. So, do we need one or two balls of yarn if it's 258 yds per balls? Thanks :)
I've been Looking for a project with this crazy soft yarn. Thanks for sharing.
Wow! This is so great and very easy for me since I just started crocheting a few days ago. Thanks!!!!
I hope you can help me, I chain 42 chains, then in the 4th chain from the hook i place 2 dc and i complete the row. However i ended up doing dc then I only have 1 chain missing which it could be my skip chain but I dont have any other chain available. What i am doing wrong. I had done everything again from the start 3 times and I AM ENDING in the same position.
Is there a way I can change the measurements to fit me??
Do you have any more videos for this type of yarn?
I can't do it    I CANT DO ANYTHING:(
Hi I am a beginner and started making your blanket. I really am excited but my blanket is not as wide as it should be. I am on my second roll and I really do not have time to pull it all out and start over. I have realized my stitches are too tight. Any advice.
Sorry I couldn't follow >u< It is a beautiful design for a blanket though :)
Do you recommend aluminum or plastic or acrylic hook. Which one are you using please ?
Thank you SOOOOOOOO much for this easy to follow tutorial . I am making this blanket for my granddaughter who is due at the end of November , first of December . I was so thrilled when I was able to understand and follow your video . Keep up the great work !
So now my blanket is starting to curl. ;(
if I use double knit yarn what size crochet hook would I use and how many chains for a pram blanket
My blanket keeps getting smaller with each row. It's turning into what looks like the bottoms half of a triangle. What am I doing wrong?
I'm 9 and I have been making this blanket. It has been very simple! Thanks for sharing this video!
This is a beautiful blanket!! I am going to try to make one. Thank you so much for the simple instructions!!
Hi I would like to make this  with regular yarn can I use a size  N hook also how many foundation chains should I make
Hello! I just made this for my little sister and she's a pretty messy baby, so i was wondering, how can this be washed?
I have tried to click on about, to get the complete details,  but nothing happens. Where can I get the details ? Thank you so much.
you can get it cheaper at walmart for like 3 dollars, the bernat yarn
Looks Great! I have never worked with that yarn before but I will be trying it out now. It looks like a good size - what were the finished measurements? I read through everything but did not see them anywhere. Sorry if I missed them! Thank you - your videos are SUPER!!
I really love doing this baby blanket thank you for the great instructions and now I am much more confident in my crocheting. You made this very easy for me to follow. I am working on my 3rd blanket
thx you helped me alot im a super beginner and i havent tryed it yet but you make it seem fun and not to hard :)
Can't wait to make this! Thanks for the tutorial!
Very nice. I just learning the single step stich. Hope one day I can do things.
What am I doing wrong I have the right hook.It doesn't look right real big holes.Help me
Hey thanks so much! This is the best baby blanket video I've ever seen!! Awesome pattern! And one more thing, I love that you show lots of times how to do the stitch so if we have a brain fart! Thanks!
made in less than a day in super chunky Lion brand Homestead USA  did three rows of sc around edge increasing to round out corners, used three balls of yarn and with edge it is 60-60 beautiful!!! thank you my nephew will love it after I add a few appliqued birds and wild animals for him to play and learn, just a few not overdue it! I will post pic when all done
If I can't find the Bernat Baby Blanket Yarn or the color I want in that brand, can I use any other soft, chunky yarn?  If so, what exactly would I be looking for to meet the requirements?
Ok, I am nearly done with this, I just went out and got the hook , i was way over thinking it, Any ideas for borders? Have you tried any where you have added one ?
Thanks so much for this tutorial for a baby blanket. I needed a pattern that was quick without a lot of counting. I will let you know how it turns out. Thanks again!
Hey Melanie!!!  Curious. If I wanted to make this into an adult cuddle blanky, do you think i should double this or triple it?
Have you seen the crochet blankets with a fabric backing?  Do you think that would look alright with this blanket?  How would you attach the fabric?
Can this be done for a throw blanket for an adult? And what size is good for a throw? Thank You:)
the biggest hook i have on hand is a H or 8.500MM  withouts going to the store, should I change the patterns at all ?
It's very nice to watch n getting the inspiration to do all. I hope to do Thanks
I just made this blanket and love it. I have coworkers asking me to make them one :). they buy the yarn and I will make it for them. I used premier yarns parfait flavors and its really a cute soft baby blanket. I loved following your video as i was making this blanket. :)
You were great on giving instructions on this baby blanket. Im a beginner, and it was easy. I made a boys and now getting ready to crochet one for a girl.
I did one row and then got lost :/
I don't know hoe to make a slip knot cus I, new or whatever it's called 😂
Great Blanket !!! Congratulations !!
I made this blanket for a baby shower gift it was easy to follow.  I now have to make bigger blankets for my granddaughters because they fell in love with how soft they are.  Thank You I love your tutorials they are so easy to follow
If u wanted it to a size  twin how manny u think to chain
My cousin just had a baby boy (his name is Messick(and he's dead cute :)). I'm seeing him for the first in a few weeks and I was wondering if I should make him something. I wasn't sure what to make, but this looks like the perfect thing! Your videos are great and really easy to follow.
my name a Melanie too XDD
Hi melanie. So happy I found u ... I started this project.  Am very excited fr it.   But as I keep adding up rows its becoming curved and and smaller  :( ..help!   don't know wat I am doing wrong..  I started with a smaller hook  and regular yarn coz I wanted to try sample.
Awesome
OMG you are amazing.  I've been trying to master the double stitch for decades and this video made it look so simple.  Thank you thank you thank you.  I have subscribed and I will definitely send you a picture of the blanket I complete for my first born granddaughter.  You are truly the bomb.com
Thanks! This really helped my sis learn how.
I love your videos! I'm teaching myself to crochet, and am a visual learner, which is why I rely on videos. So many crochet videos are unclear and go way too fast. You really are a great teacher. Thank you so much!
This is such a cute blanket! Super easy! I did the stitching a little tighter, though, but I still love it! I've made one with 42 across, and I was curious if there was a way I could add to the finished one to make it wider? It's a perfect baby blanket but I wanted to make it bigger for me :-)
Thank you, very simple & fun, when I finish i'll post a pic. I want to make an adult size blanket, & I plan on showing my daughter this video to learn how, again Thank You:)
Started crocheting yesterday, and your one of the easiest people to follow that I've found on here! Thanks :)
Hi, so I am trying to do that blanket but I am using a different yarn measure and a different hook measure. Do I still stitch only 42 stitches or what should I do ? My yarn is 5mm and my hook is 6.5 mm k. Have a nice day and thank you for your videos
Thank you so much. My blanket came out beautiful. I made it with 92 chains . My kids fight for it every day. Do u have another video using the same yarn a hook. Maybe a different pattern.
cute easy love it thank you for sharing
Oh, how long, and wide was your blanket? I actually used two 10.5 ounces of the yarn. Btw, the second one I am doing I did not do 42, I am doing 54 chains. I read someone that it needs to be multiples of 6.
Just wanted to thank you for this pattern; I made a beautiful baby blanket, and on my second one. The first one I used the baby blanket yarn (bernat), but a N hook, not a P. The second one I started and am using a P hook. I am excited as it didn't take long at all (a few evenings of my time)
Hi Melanie, I have a problem with my crocheting, as I make more rows the whole thing seems to curve and not lay out straight. What am I doing wrong?
if you were using thinner yarn would you have to make the foundation chain longer
didnt work out for me
You are too fast... Cant get the stiches
I can do this!!! Lol
I just got started and I'm having a problem with my chains.  Some are small and some are large.  My tension is way off.
HI, Melanie!! I'm just beginning to crochet and I think I'll give this blanket a try!  I just have one question: Is it possible to add an edge to this blanket? If so, which edge would be easy for starters like me? I've never done any of this stuff before :)
Just bought all the stuff to make this blanket! excited.. can i use a 12mm hook its the only one I have
Πωςνα μπλεξω παιδικο μπολερο
What was the finished width and length of the baby blanket? You said one roll was about 17 inches by 31 inches.  So was the finished blanket 34" x  62". What is the most popular size for a regular baby blanket for a gift?
I love this video; but the base chain stich you recommended was too short, so I  made mine a big bigger, for a baby boy, I used different colored yarn, mixed blue, white and grey light color, I love the easy pattern though.
Hi,  I am a beginner and just teaching myself but I am wondering if it is possible to do this blanket in a stripe pattern.. Looooove this blanket
how big is the blanket when finished?
I am enjoying this project for my grandson very much. Thank you! Any ideas for an fun edging I could add that would compliment the style of the blanket?
I'm almost done with this blanket. I'm very new to crochet so this will be my first finished blanket. Do you have any videos on how you actually end it? Thank you!
Hey Melanie,  TYSM for posting this easy baby blanket. I am a novice in crocheting but i wanted the challenge & just completed one. I wanted to post it on your FB page but I couldn't for some reason. It definitely was a fun project and I believe that my nephew will enjoy his 1st softie blankie.  Keep up the good work. God bless!
I modified this design and used smaller yarn to make a scarf; it turned out great! I love your channel!
I am having a hard time finding this yarn, I went to walmart maybe that's why but when I do a related search online I can't seem to find the colors and "feel" of this yarn
What the hek I cant keep up I can not do it its for my dog he is the size of a baby
when i do the double crochet on this blanket i end up with a curve or wave to it and it is not staight like yours is in the video how do i fix this
Hi, love your videos. Keep it up!  I'm going to order the same yarn you posted online however how many do I need to purchase to make the blanket? Thanks
Thank you for the replies to my comment.  I was finally able to get some in JoAnn's, but they didn't have that many colors to pick from.
I can actually see the boxes through yours, but mine, I can hardly see my boxes, and I'm following it the exact same way, I wonder why is that?
how many balls of yarn would i need to make a blanket for a two and a half year old.
I love your cool blanket
I am a beginner but I am almost finished with my blanket and I was hoping to add a border just to give it a more finished feel, either in the same or a different color.  Could you point me in the direction of a border that would be appropriate for this pattern?
Can i use a 4.25mm hook? How would it look
hi i am wanting to make this in to a twin size do you know how much yarn i might need?
This is the best video I have found for a blanket pattern.. so simple!  I have been sharing your videos to a group that make items for premature babies in Victoria, Australia.. thank you so much 😄
Great esdy tutorial, Thx! Subscribed Ur channel <3
hi do you knit things too?
Thank you for the pattern, I love quick and easy patterns. the one I favor most is the never ending granny pattern. the only down fall with this there is not row cut off.  For a baby blanket  how many rows would be best?
i like ur video thanks for sharing it
You got a new subscriber ☺️👍
Can i use a smaller hook?
I have started working on this project a little every night and so far i am loving it! Is there a way to fix the edging? I noticed as i am going that I seem to be losing stitches (even though I thought I was putting the double crochet in the right stitch) But it seems to lean diagonal a bit, and i'm not sure how to fit it! help please!
Just finished my blanket :) not sure how to post my pic of it though?
i'm doing it! I am actually doing it right!
i am using thin yarn and a N-9.00MM hook.
I'm smiling and when i smile i'm happy and nervous and i'm really nervous because i tried to do a project like this an hour ago it turned into a skull. it's weird how my screw ups turn into cool stuff
Going to give it a try for my first granddaughter...I love the way you show every step.  I pause, pause, pause like you suggested...
Hi  I followed your link to the amazon site and the wool is currently unavailable, plus I don't think it is available I'm the uk.  Are you able to suggest an alternative?  I'm a complete beginner to crocheting so have not got much idea when it comes to wool types etc.  thanks.
So is it for babies, or made out of babies..?
You are so easy to listen to and learn from.  Do you have easy pattern for baby booties or hats to give to cancer patients.  Your channel is the best.  Thank you.  I am so going to try this.  My daughters friend is having a baby at the end of July.  I really wanted to make something since I never have.  This blanket will be perfect.  I have a disability with my left hand but I think I'll be able to do.  Wish me luck.
Thank you for this video...
hi im beginning your blanket I was wanting to find out how many chains you did for the blanket that u showed in the beginning of the video I have the same yarn and ive chained 42 but it looks small to me I hope im doing everything right me back thanks
Hi, I'm 60 and had a stroke a year ago so I'm pretty slow at crocheting but am determined to make a pretty baby blanket for my new grandson due July 24! I need easy instructions as well & your tutorial is perfect for me. (Great job!) BUT...I already have the regular yarn that I want to use, not the thick kind. Can you please tell me how many chains I should use for a normal baby blanket size?  Thanks!!
I'm making this right now it's looking great :)
This is my first crochet project ever and im hooked. Your instructions are great and easy to follow.  Im off to go get more yarn because i did get the smaller size ball. My baby is due in December 2014 and i cant wait to wrap him/her in this blanket. Thank you!
Will it be same for any 6 yarn?
I'm 12 and know how to crochet good but, your video helped me a lot. I looked at all kinds of videos that other people had made and could not figure out how to make that kind of blanket thank you so so much.
What brand and color lipstick are you wearing in this video? Pretty :)
I love this pattern, it's so easy! Thank you for the great and easy tutorial :)
thank you
great video thanks
I am really interested in crocheting and love this baby blanket! I'm just wondering if using a bigger crochet hook is easier to learn with as it allows the stitches to be bigger? I have been using a much smaller crochet hook to begin and sometimes i manage to make my stitches so tight that i have troubles fitting the hook through to the next stitch! If this size hook would be easier please let me know because I would love to get into crocheting more, you are very inspiring! Thanks! :)
Hello.. i am from India . I am very interesting in crochet . But here we are not getting all numbers crochet hooks. Could you help me? And your crochet works are very pretty.
is it possible to change colors easily?
Lovely blanket. will try out a larger version. Just not sure if I can get a similar yarn & crochet needle here in India.
Cool; can't wait to make this for my baby boy cousin, is due next month!!!
If I use a regular sized yarn should I double the amount in the original chain?
Would that blanket crochet work on a thinner yarn or would bulky work better?
I just discovered your You Tube videos, when I found this baby blanket, and I love it.  I have been looking for a quick baby gift, and this is perfect!  However, I am having a hard time finding the yarn.  After going to one Michael's store, two A.C. Moore stores, and two JoAnn's, I still don't have any yarn.  First of all, I got confused because I realized that there are two different sizes of yarn - a smaller one, and a much larger one.  I had to come home to watch the video again, to see if you showed the one you used, and it appears to be the much larger one.  Secondly, it seems that all the stores have had Bernat yarn on sale, and their supplies were pretty depleted.  I have one more store that I can try, and hopefully I will come home with some yarn today!  I have subscribed to your channel, and I look forward to watching your other videos.
About how long does it take to make this?
Hey there!  I am working on this and so far it's going great.  However, I only got through about 5 rows before I ran out of yarn.  So though I have the same type and color, it must be a smaller ball of yarn than what you have.  Which is fine, but that means I will have to buy a few more balls probably to get through this project.  So what I need to know is how many rows total should I have so that I know when it is complete?    Sorry if this is a dumb question.  This is my first real crochet project!
Just starting to crochet after 35 years.  Am going to try and make this afghan for my daughter at college.  Can this afghan be made bigger?
i did 42 stitches to start but mine doesnt look as long as yours. should i have added more?
I just started crocheting and this was awesome! I have just a few supplies so I really want to go shopping and get more stuff for this and other projects!!! Loved the video!
Would I still be able to do this same way of making the blanket with a thinner type of yarn. I don't have any that size available in my location.
I'm attempting to make this baby blanket with a different type of yarn than what you used. The blanket is for my newest granddaughter and I had my daughter and son-in-law pick out the yarn(s) and colors they'd like... well they picked out a very pretty yarn that has almost a boucle type texture. Your pattern was the easiest one I found for this yarn as it's very textured and difficult to see the single stiches. My question is about changing colors to add stripes to the blanket. I know what I would TRY but if you could explain it I would appreciate knowing if I'm doing it properly lol. Thank you! I love your tutorials!! I haven't tried alot of patterns and I learn easier by watching not reading patterns and you teach very well, very clear. :D
We are using the exact same yarn, just a different color, you said do 42 chains. Why is yours so wide but mine is narrow?
i had love the way you teach for beginners ... i had just learn how to do crochet tutorials ...i had seen u the best...thnk u
trying so hard to make this never crocheted anything finally got some done but the whole blanket is starting to curve ... so frustrating!
Thank you so much.  I am a beginner and I have watched tons of videos and almost lost hope of learning... But your video was so easy to follow and I am in the process of making my baby blanket and it looks great! Thanks again for such a great tutorial
If im just using regular yarn do i have to do 42 chains at the beginning still? Or about how many?
I love your tutorials they are so easy to follow! It's funny because I was waiting for you to do a baby blanket. Thanks!
Is there something that shows the measurements that this blanket is SUPPOSED to be? I say supposed to be, because I am on my fourth ball of yarn, and while it looks great, it is not nearly the size I think it's supposed to be. HELP! Lol
Love all your crochet art and crafts video they are the best. Your the best too. I have question is it okay to wash the blanket before giving it to a love one? Im making baby blankets for two baby showers and since babies have sensitive skin I was wondering if is okay to that.
Can't wait to make this, thank you!
If I want to make an adult size, how many stitches are in the base chain
Love your videos ,thanks for creating them.Hope you many more god bless your family.:);)
Thank you Melanie!
You are my FAVORITE youtuber. I am an advanced sewist like you but I always learn so much! I saw this blanket and fell in love so I went to Joanns and bought all of my supplies for this blanket! :)
Omg.  Your swoon quilt is beautiful!   Do you have a video or a blogpost about what fabrics you used?   😍
Thank you Melanie for all your videos. I'm working my way through them from over here in the UK! You are such a good teacher and I love all your projects. My family and I are visiting California on holiday in August and I'm hoping to get to some good craft stores!! Xxx
