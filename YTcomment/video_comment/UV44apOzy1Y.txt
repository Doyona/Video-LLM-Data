This is One of the Best Vanilla Ice Cream Recipes I've ever seen Great Job Stephanie
❤❤❤❤
Who 😂comes back here is year😊❤
💝💝💝 loved your recipe
I am a Boomer and I am going to try this manually at first to see if I really need a machine. I recently saw a visit on YouTube to an artisan ice cream maker in Germany. It looked as though they transferred three semi-frozen flavors, one on top of the other, into a silicon loaf pan and then placed that into a super cold freezer. I am dreaming of a super-beany vanilla in between chocolate and hazelnut. Thanks Stephanie!
if i am in hurry can we make the mixture without turning it into a custard? Can I just make the mixture then put it in my machine? Thank you
I love your recipes! Thank you for sharing so many with us❤
Great job!
UHMAZING RECIPE!!!!!!!!  I bought an ice cream machine and this was the first flavour I made and one it is soooooo good!!!  I just had one question. Can I reduce the sugar to 100 grams? I want to make it less sweet.
Please please please make mango and butterscotch ice creams. ❤❤
Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I made this vanilla ice cream and it turned out delicious.    Better than the store-bought ice creams.  It is creamy, soft, the right sweetness.  I used the still freeze method. My family loved it.
I knew you were great the second I heard you talking about vanilla!!!  I make my own paste extracts sugars.    You gave such accurate explanation about them and said not to buy the sad dried ones😂  I was making ice cream with eggs for the first time and was terrified of making the eggs scrambled.
So I know I have asked, but I don't remember which recipe I had asked on. But which brand of ice cream maker do you have? I am determined to get the same one as you especially because I love how quiet it is? If you don't mind, may I please have the brand information and how ever many cups it can hold etc?
And the best part: never asked for likes, subscription or share...although she deserves them of course.
I freeze the Bowl I'm going to place the ice cream in for the freezer.  Speeds up the freezing process.
Thank you ❤️ for the recipe
I made this today. Came out so good. It's a little too rich for me though. May reduce the egg yolks from 5 to 4.
YOU ARE SUCH A DELIGHT TO WATCH AND LEARN FROM ..YOU ARE SO EAAAAY ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU EXPLAIN AND I GET MORE CONFIDENT.THANK YOU💕🌈
Bu aralar yaptığım için bu tarz videolar karşıma çıkıyor. İzlerken altyazı ile konuşmayı anlamak istedim Türkçe yok, açıklamada malzemelere bakar yaparım dedim, yazılmamış. Yorumlarda herkes çok iyi öğrettiğinizi,bu işi bildiğinizi yazmışlar ama konuşma çok olduğu halde ingilizce bilmeyenler sizi hiç anlamıyorlar. Lütfen artık tüm dünyanın sizleri izlediğinin farkına varın ve çevirileri aktifleştirin. Bu kadar zor olmamalı bu😞Çoğunu ve dikkat edilmesi gereken şeyleri anlamasamda denemek istiyorum, teşekkür ederim.
Can I use double heavy cream instead of half and half?
I would like to start a business using this  method. Do you think it would be profitable.?
You put it in for 4 minutes is that how much I should put it in for
Wait how long did you put the cream in the microwave for
Is vanilla and banana essence
Is there an alternate for the ice cream machine ?
It’s amazing they you respond to every comment!
If I don’t am ice cream machine , can y just get into the fridge , the chilled custard ?
Hello there!! Is it ok to sweeten with stevia or another sweetener other than sugar ? Thanks
This channel has been around for a long time. It's been a go to of mine for quite some time.  Recipes are always easy to follow and without a doubt, the best you'll ever make. Still love this channel.  🙂
I can't wait to try your ice cream recipe. What brand of ice cream maker do you have?
Thanks for sharing.......
I have mentioned this in another video she has done. Regardless, for those of you who have not seen it, here it goes again. I went to culinary school back in the day when the internet, let alone YouTube existed. We were taught so many things that are now available on YouTube. Obviously because of my culinary background I can tell when a recipe makes sense or not, as there are so many ( self acclaimed ) chefs out there making videos. This lady right here knows what she is doing. Pay attention to her recipes and how she weighs ingredients, she gives them to you in the imperial and US system.
Nice video. Im always on the lookout for a great vanilla. Im into salt n straw at the moment because I like the eggless bases..it seems to help the vanilla flavour come through.        How important would you say the eggs are?
Oh no
Can I use this with cookies
Useful during quarantine 🥰❤️
I tried this and it was a big success and I used the "still freeze" method since I don't have an ice cream machine. Only change I did was reduce the sugar to 125g, but my family and I agreed the sugar could be even lower, maybe 115g would be ideal.
5 eggs...
I love it, Nice!
What brand of ice cream machine did you use?
i made this and it turned out GREAT !  just a question, may i reduce the sugar slightly ? its quite sweet. perhaps to 115-120g?
Everyting was going great until she used microwave to heat up the milk :(
Any Crystal or ice??
You are so organised in the kitchen everything's ready
I just love watching her videos she explain everything to the t love yo your videos
I love to bake and cook and im only 13. Last month I went to colima to visit my grandma and I tried homemade vanila ice cream and know that I been  wanting to make some myself hopefully I make some this week this video is going to be  helpful.
OMG!!!!!! THANK YOU THIS WAS SOOOO DELICIOUS 🤤
Hello,  Cream is as a whipping cream ?
When you are in quarntine😂
🙏✅thank
Pls what is the name of your ice machine
How many servings u made ? If we serve 2 scoops per person ???
How many servings u made ? If we serve 2 scoops per person ???
Thanks for all of your great videos, always to the point and easy to follow. I especially like the fact that you always use a spatula or spoon to get all of the ingredients from the bowl not wasting one drop. Food is a blessing not to be wasted.
Thank you for this excellent video! I really appreciate that you gave the amounts in metric too!
Stephanie, thank you very much,. I have made it already for 2nd time, it is delicious. I would be grateful if you add some more healthy options for ice cream like yogurt, ricotta, etc.
I think this would be much easier to make using an electric hand mixer lol.
Finally someone who made proper icecream from scratch, I knew when I clicked on your video you would offer what I was after. Thanks very much :)
Can i use full cream milk
Plz show eggless
Perfect
Can v use non diary  whipping cream for half and half
Thanks for showing us how to make Ice Cream 😁🎊 Looks Good 😊
If I want to add rum to this, at which point do I add it?
I’m on the Paradox Diet, and we cannot use Cow’s Milk, can I substitute Coconut Milk instead?
Wow, I made a double batch of this wonderful vanilla custard and added  2 1/4 cups of peach puree.  The peaches were fresh from the fruit stands of North Carolina!  They are so tasty but I had to put some aside and try it.   It is amazing peach custard.   I thought about cooking the peaches down a bit first or substitute some 1/2&1/2 with cream, but it turned out great.  All said, the final volume was a little over 2 qts.
The inside of your microwave oven is crazy clean! You must not have any kids in your home.
Just to let you know that I’ve already made your recipe 2 times in a row. It’s sooooo good. It’s my favorite now! Thanks again Steph for sharing this delicious recipe 🙏😋
I wanna to ask about the ice cream machine nd the link of buying it
Thank you so much joy i like your channel
I ordered an ice cream machine & it will arrive Sunday! Anything Stephanie makes is delicious! My Mom & Grandma always made their ice cream this way but  I did not have the recipe. Now I do! Can't wait!
Its easy, delicious, and everybody can buy these ingredients. I also like how precise you are with the measurement and instructions they are very helpful
Omg I watched this when I started to cook I was 8 at that time. Now I’m 14 and a huge respect for Stephane ❤️
Made this over the past weekend and it was the best ice cream ever. Alot better than the recipe that came with my ice cream machine.  I had to kind of guess on the curd temperature because my thermometer broke and I couldn't tell how coated the back of my wooden spoon was. I had a hard time seeing the line that you draw with your finger but it came out perfect.  I ordered a new thermometer for next time. I'll have to triple the recipe as well, it was gone in one night lol. Looking forward to making more.
Nice :)
hi Ms. Stephanie May I ask is it half milk and half whipping cream?  thanks
Can i replace the cream with carnation milk? Condensed?
Much thanks and love from India... have enjoyed making recipes watching you, your cakes are just awesome.  Tried the ice cream, came out well except the fact that there was a slight aftertaste of egg, and once i took out the ice cream from the ice cream maker and put it in a plastic tub to keep in the freezer for the night but noticed little crystallisation. Please help  Ps. Followed your recipe to the T from ingredients, its quantity to the temperatures suggested.
Can I use heavy whipping cream instead of half and half?
That's how I start my homemade banana pudding. 😳
Can I use heavy cream and milk?
Hello Stephanie....u said equal amount of whole milk and (light)cream? Is   whipping cream with around 30-35 percent fat ok to use?
Can i use a whipping cream instead of the half and half? Am confused
wow yummy.
Wonderful I love ❤️ it
Just finished this recipe. Its in the freezer freezing right now. Can't wait to eat it. It taste so good. YUM 🤤🍦
Once again ...You Are Simply THE BEST  AT TEACHING 🤗
Can I freeze it or do I have to put it into a machine?
Before being in quarantine I never cared to learn how to make ice cream or bake but here I am making all kinds of fun things 😆  my mix is currently chilling, I’m excited to eat it!!
Subscribed!! ❤️
😍👌👍
Wow the fact that she told us what to do if we dont have an ice cream machin is just so holsum and amazing
I think ice cream was the epitome of food technology...so good
Thank you so much
We had this wonderful vanilla custard for dessert tonight.  Whereas the chocolate custard knocks your socks off and makes you yell, "oh my!", this vanilla custard is polite, refined, calm and creamy.  You can enjoy every bite just as much but without making a scene.   It is very good.  We all loved it.  I found an eggless cookie dough recipe and added it in at my daughter's request.   Thank you.  Chocolate brownie cookies are on deck! One interesting thing. I used my hand mixer on high speed for the chocolate ice and it worked well to avoid egg clumps.  With the vanilla custard, it did foam up a bit.  I scooped some off and the rest settled in the fridge.  I'll just put the mixer on a medium setting next time.
When you don’t have only 4 ingredients
I love you videos❤❤
I heard you should never put milk  in  a microwave (do to how fast the milk  heats up I heard it can cause Cancer ) I wouldn't do it  ( stay safe and heat it up the old fashioned way )
B
We watch you taste it alone , how can we taste it with you.
First, I need an ice cream maker & some of the ingredients. Home made taste so much better and don't have preservative in it.
EGG YOLKS IN ICECREAM 😫😣😳😤😠😶😮😲
I’ve had better results when I earlier extract the beans and cooked them with the yolks. This way I get a head start in the flavor adding process ;-)
I can’t go out to buy ice cream cuz of the corona..so that’s why I’m here making my OWN.
So to summarize, eggs, sugar, vanilla, custard,  half n half milk, all whisked in and heated gently to the required temp, and all put in ice cream maker which was left overnight in the freezer. 20 minutes later creamy ice-cream. I am sorry I was fast forwarding through the explanations, so if I missed something here, do let me know. Oh, if you add pulped mango with it all, it will turn out divine!
You called it ice cream and then you called it custard and then you call it ice cream and then you called it custard. Do you realize how confusing that is?
thats one big thermometer🤣🤣  but good recipe though even in 2020
Can I use this formula for ice cream rolls?
As always great presentation thank you for sharing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Throat pain  later try ok
So we bound to put eggs in it .
I like to see she make things
Can i use powder whip cream with the same method
May the custard be made in advance and stored in frig?  If so, how long may it be kept before using?
too    start
sorry      for   laught
wow  hahahahahheheheheh
wow
Lots of fun to make.
Name sake u are great can bama or jago cream be used? Just want to know about the milk mixture
Looks great! You recommend light cream. Most recipes use heavy cream?
Does anyone know how much this makes?
What type of thermometer are you using ?
Thank you so much
Such a helpful video!  And your kind, gentle personality comes shining through.  Thank you!
this amazing
Young Lady: You are simply amazing. My only question Is (or any anyone who can help me) How do you INCREASE... for a 6 quart ole style freezer? Please, Thank you kindly!
What kind of cream
Good morning joy, please can you tell me the name of your ice cream machine or put the link down the video so we all can benefit from it and God bless you.
Love your recipes! So detailed and well explained.
Please any alternative to cream...I stay in Nigeria and I don't think we have cream 😁🤔
Please any alternative to cream...I stay in Nigeria and I don't think we have cream 😁🤔
Can I use milk instead of cream plss ans
Your recipes are so yummy. However one question keeps coming up in my mind when I watch your videos. How do you manage to remain so slim despite being a fabulous cook?
nice one
good demonstration stephanie love your work
Loved the ice cream
Lovely recipe.
Oh it's nice
This Vanilla Ice Cream recipe looks so tasty Stephanie.
What if you dont have a iceceam machine

Yuuuuum

your a very good teacher or tutor
is it possible to use a blender for the egg yolks ??
how about cherry ice cream,banana ice cream,chocolate ice cream??
that looks good and taste good
Its really amazing, am going to try mine and  see how it works
She is a special woman
Hi Stephanie. After bringing the custard to room temperature, I let it chill and the custard has a thick layer of oil on top of it. Please help.
you seem really enjoy cooking, mam. cheers from Indonesia
You really love what you do. You are always very clear. U just make everything easy. Nice work ma.
Yummy 🤤  🍨
How long did you put the half and half in the microwave?
I love the comment about her kids eating it before it gets cold:  when Stephanie laughs, it makes me smile.
so nice i love it Thanks for sharing❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
veryrichwithstrawberrysyrup
I like your style
Can you please let me how to spell it
a great and easy recipe as always, just made it even though summer is already becoz somebody was craving vanilla ice cream at home =^.^= thank you
alikedwithpinneapple.topping
Made this tonight. It was amazing. It fit the icecream maker well. Just enough to feed 4 people, or 5 if you have it with a side dessert like we did tonight. We had it with a slice of banana bread. But we all wanted more icecream.
I never knew vanilla ice cream has raw egg. 😟
Hi  Can I use whipping cream instead  of fresh Cream?
my siblings demolished this! I love it!
thank you for showing the details. i don't have a ice cream machine and now i know how to make this
Hi! Can I pour this into my ice cream cake while I'm making it? Right? Because this way the fresh ice cream will freeze once rather than freezing it and then struggle to  form a nice shapely cake?
Hi Stephanie. Got a problem. I want to make home made ice cream cakes. But If I make this ice cream why would I want to freeze it when it's much easier to use the soft ice cream for the assembly of the cake layers.
What is the model of the ice cream machine?
i like how you explain in detail especially for those who don't have ice cream maker on how to managed like stirring it occasionally.
I’m gonna tell you guys about this recipe when i’m done making it. See you in a day or two!
And.aloved.withvainillacake.mc.cain

All purpose cream and condensed milk will do
Alike.vanillaicecream.withchocolatepoundcake.or.withbimboscookies.or.caramelsyrup.butmyfavorite.iswithlemonlayercake
Used to watch her vids when I was 10 and wanted to be a baker. Just rediscovered them 7 years later as a hungry stoner.
Store ice cream loaded with junk
Yummy yummy..🤔
Wonderful video! Finally I know why my mixture splits every time I heat it. In my recipe it is only: heat it until covers the spoon, don't bring to boil. So I was heating it until 95 celcius. I like this woman very much, she explains very well and she is so natural. Lovely!
No no dont ask .
Happy
Stephanie, what if I don't have the ice cream machine?
I made your Vanilla Ice Cream recipe yesterday and today. Sooooo good ! I can't wait to try the chocolate recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Thank you so much for this detailed recipe. I for the longest while I've only managed to find two step two ingredient variants and that's not what I wanted to try. I wanted to make something flavorful and I'm really looking forward to your recipe in the following days. I'm definitely saving this for later so I can always come back to it. <3
- Can I add whipped cream to the custard instead of adding the cream directly? - Can I use Corn starch to thicken the cutard?
Good morn.n from South Africa 🌸 your ice cream looks sinfully delicious...lol you explain the process as. a science teacher would to a class good going
(Possibly) Canadian pronunciation of "house" (11:18), "about" (11:40) and "out" (11:47).
I like it   you are a great chef
Thank you Stephanie - You are Everywoman!  In other words - all woman to all people. X

Thank you for posting this!! It's so clear and I really like how you explain the why behind what you're doing. I'm heading to the kitchen now! I see homemade ice cream in my future!
Kudos.. I've seen many recipes for homemade ice cream, yours is the 1st one whom I've seen ad the necessary bit of salt, flavour enhancer. I grew up making homemade ice cream, sitting on the machine while men cranked, as a toddler and older. Now I have electric 4 and 6 at machines, and make it myself! I'm 61.
Give me recipe
can we add vanilla powder than adding vanilla extract
Thanks Mam...
Hi Joy, I love your videos. Could you please upload a video on making ice cream without an ice cream maker. Thank you.
This is a stupid question, but cooking the egg like this, does it "cancel" the danger of salmonella? I am really scared when it comes to eggs
You Mahboubi Mohammed from Egypt
ok great job.. but, may someone explain to me the reason behind cooking the mixture at the beginning ? since ur afraid that it may cook ur eggs, then why u have to almost boil it 1st ? is that so the ingredients melt and mix with each other or to extract more flavour ?
so I can't use pure milk
Where did you buy the pot?
the cream can replace with whipping cream?
can i add liquid stevia sweetener instead of white sugar?
Ice cream cake
Excellent!

i hate eating uncook eggs.. can i possible make ice cream w/o egg yolks...?
Can I use whip cream an alternative for heavy whipping cream?
Can I make custard in a blender?
The main thing is not to eat it right out of the machine :) If i don't add sugar to egg yolks (i am going to use stevia based sweetener), will the texture be okay?

Eww why do we need egg
I just can't wait to try this at home! Thank you so much for continuing to share your recipes with us. More power! :D
Here in Indonesia,  cream is expensive. But it's not just cream that's expensive, cream cheese, whole wheat flour, and even butter is expensive.
Which icecream maker did you use? xx
Awesome recipe, thank you!! I just made it and it's cooling down. I can't wait to freeze it up so i can eat it!!!! 😄
how many eggs would I need to use if I were to make half of the recipe? thanks :)

Thank you mam for explaining clearly n in detail.
can I use heavy cream instead of half and half
Ice cream.  🙌🏼
I absolutely love everything that you make and your tutorials are fantastic.  I can't wait to make this custard.
Hi Stephanie! You have good kids, cause in my case, my son does not like this type of ice cream (I did the same vanilla and strawberry both with egg yolk custard and heavy cream). Store bought ice cream is the only one "good" to eat...I have a similar ice-cream maker, but I haven't used it years, as I was the only one eating the ice cream I made...but one day I'll do it for myself.
would u mind telling me how to make coconut ice cream?

Hi, is it possible to make this without an ice cream maker?
It's delish!  Thanks for the recipe!!!
Hi Stephanie! Can you please tell me that what can I a dd instead of egg
Where can I get an ice cream maker?
I'm going to experiment with half sugar and half Karo light syrup. I've heard the Karo makes the ice cream creamier. I just hope it sweetens about the same. Thanks for making this with half & half. I didn't have any heavy cream on hand and I wondered if I could substitute.
Hi I made this today. But it didn't work out as shows in the you tube. I have tried your cakes but they came well. You are doing a great job. I think I over cooked. Custard was cream not a liquid like your one. I don't have a thermometer. Tx Mihiri
Nice
🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥
Can i do it whit out a ice cream matin
Is it possible to make this low carb by using artificial sweetener?
Can i use sour cream and milk
Before making any recipes, I tend to go to a hand full of my favourite channels and see what they have. I've noticed certain people use greater amounts of cream vs milk, or vise versa, meanwhile you use an equal amount. My question to you is, what would the difference in conclusion be if you were to use more of one than the other vs an equal amount or half and half?
i may save some eggs to make this i like to use half n half  whole milk cost lot more here
0:30. Also. Good to know exactly what goes into it without all those E substances.
I like the video and I like vanilla bean so good choice!👍👍
Yum yum yum
i like vanilla ice cream
Where do,I get vinla bean
Hi, nice vid :) will definitely try this once I get an ice cream machine. A small tip for you which saves time and effort: try adding the vanilla been (split in half) a few minutes before you take the custard off the heat. This way you won't have to mess around with removing the seeds (they should come off the skin) and custard will also gain more flavor. The bean skin will not fall apart, so you should be able to easily remove it later on. ;)
Hi Stephanie i would like to know which brand is the candy thermometer you use? thanks, i love your videos :)
Please answer we are making some thing in school and have to bye the ingredients
If we want to add crushed cookie instead of vinlla bean can we do that

Thank you, I made it once,  it was great! I am planning to make another batch,  and am wondering if I can use whole eggs? If so how many?

I like the soft serve, too! Looks delicious!
Hi Mrs Jaworski, I watch your videos and I find it calming, sitting for exam soon. I am particularly amused by you at 2.25. For someone who demonstrates so seriously, that's really really funny. :-)

Hi Stephanie, thank you for your wonderful tutorials, I really enjoy them and learn a lot from you...I have a question, to make the chocolate ice cream do I use this same recipe or use different quantities of ingredients?.....I will appreciate very much your help... Thank you very much and have a great day! Ciao
oh that looks amazing i have to try it soon it's pretty worm here in Greece and a nice,cool vanilla ice cream is all i need!thank you once again for a great recipe!xoxoxo
can I replace the half and half & sugar with sweetened condensed milk?
Could I use heavy cream to make the ice cream?
I'm not sure if this question is already asked. Is it okay if we add in the vanilla earlier on?

I make that Ice Cream
Now I want to eat icecream so bad♡
I make it straight after watching this video! It tasted so nice and now I'm waiting for it to set in the freezer!
Wow I can't believe how easy it is to make ice cream at home.
Can you make a ice cream video without the ice cream maker?
you should get the cuisinart ice 30 it freezes it to a lot harder form
How far in advance are the these videos filmed?
There's also another way where you put the custard into a Ziploc bag and freeze it and then put it over rock salt mixed with ice. Just keep shaking the two together and it forms ice cream! I don't remember the exact recipe cause it was a couple of years ago when I was in my Biology class. That was hands down, one of the most fun days there.
Very nice!
Homemade ice cream is always fantastic. Thanks Stephanie for this easy tutorial.
OK thanks I will be making this. Great video!
Can you start making vlogs
First comment! Anyways thanks this looks Delicious can't wait to make it
