Thank you!
I made this and didn’t even do the measurements the same and it actually taste exactly like Panda Express this is the best recipe I recommend
Tasty
Nice
I really like the dish, but it is american not chinese 😊
brother you cant just say oil lmfao what oil are you adding
It tasted great but not quite like panda express orange chicken. It had a bit too much of the orange taste, which isn't prominent in panda orange chicken. That's probably why they only use orange zest in the original recipe. It also needs to be a bit more vinegary.
Either I'm getting sick and temporarily losing my taste or cooked way too much chicken, which I seriously used only a single chicken breast this was in the top 2 or 3 of worst orange chicken I have ever made, I've heard a lot of pro chefs use tang instead of actual orange juice and that was my only substitution. Skip this one
That’s not enough water for that consistency of slurry. You need 2x that amount. 1.5 cups make bread dough
Gonna make this as well as stir fry tomorrow
I'm not asia or asian food at home.
Well i had to substitute aomemof the ingredients,  but...it turned out pretty dang good :)
How disappointing that the recipe isn't correct, especially coming from a major corporation like Tasty. Like others have mentioned, you have to edit the quantities. Better off just watching another video recipe.
I made this twice watching this vid and man they think i'm a professional chef 😅
1 1/2 cups of water makes bread dough for sure.
Riquísimo y fácil
TIP: swap water with cold club soda/sparkling water for more crunch!

2:20 allergic so I make mine without and cant go to chinese food because they dont know wtf Im saying
Ingredients for 8 servings  CHICKEN  2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (905 g) 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon white pepper 1 cup cornstarch (125 g) 3 cups flour (375 g) 1 egg 1 ½ cups water (360 mL) 2 tablespoons oil 6 cups oil (1 ½ L), for frying ORANGE SAUCE  1 tablespoon oil ¼ teaspoon chili flake 1 tablespoon garlic, minced ½ teaspoon ginger, minced ¼ cup sugar (50 g) ¼ cup brown sugar (55 g) ¼ cup orange juice (60 mL) ¼ cup white distilled vinegar (60 mL) 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons water 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 teaspoon sesame oil  Preparation On a cutting board, cut chicken into 1x1-inch (2x2-cm) cubes and set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, combine salt, white pepper, cornstarch, and flour. Whisk to combine. Add the egg, water, and oil until it reaches the consistency of pancake batter. Add the chicken to the batter and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Heat oil in a wok or heavy bottom pan to 350˚F (180˚C). Gently add the chicken and cook for 5-6 minutes until lightly golden brown. Remove the chicken from the pan and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Set a heavy bottomed pot over medium- high heat and add the oil. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the red pepper flakes, ginger, and garlic, and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Add the sugar and brown sugar, and stir to combine. Add in the orange juice and allow the sugars to begin to dissolve in the liquid, stirring occasionally. Add in the vinegar and soy sauce, and stir to combine. Add the cornstarch and water together and whisk to combine. Add to the pan and stir. Continue to cook the sauce until maple syrup consistency is achieved. Add in the fried chicken and stir until completely coated in the sauce. Top with sesame oil. Enjoy!
You need to add more water
can I get away with just using cornstarch? I don't have flour and I'm lazy to buy
OK, I had to use about 2 1/2 to almost 3 cups of water to get the batter close to what it looks like in the video. I also have 2 to 2 1/2 pounds of chicken breast makes about three times the amount needed for one of their batches of sauce. So I just made a total of three batches of sauce and was able toget everything coated appropriately. It tastes amazing.
I'm still waiting the part where he pours the orange juice into the recipe.
Making it right now and will text back how it came out.😊
2 pounds chicken, salt, whiter pepper , cornstarch, flour, 1 egg,  oil  vegetable oil, chili flakes, ginger, garlic, sugar, brown sugar, orange juice, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil
What is that cooking pots name?
What better way to keep it a secret than to put out a fake recipe
Delicious 😋 👍🥤
Followed the recipe  Your amounts make a dough not a batter 😂😂😂
I used to work at Panda Express in the kitchen. This is not how we made the orange chicken lol
This is an excellent video but something is wrong. Many people mention in the comments that you actually need 2 & 1/2 cups of water but this way you make way too much batter. I was making orange chicken for lunch & dinner 2 days in a row. You probably have to change the amount of flour you put in to 2 cups of flour instead of 3.
Delicious 😋 ❤
Way too much flour Too much sugar. Reduce both and it’s great
Why are his words perfectly on beat?? 😭He's spitting
Some of The measurements are incorrect lol
Thank you!
OK so I just made this, rest in peace my kitchen. They’re actually so good but there’s a butt so maybe a little less sugar when I’m doing the sauce that’s all I can say.
It was delicious, thanks 👍
Swap water for beer, came out good
i just made it and it's sooooo delacious recomend thank to this veejoo
made it tonight and the batter was like previous posters say way to thick and doughy, the sauce though was top notch.
Made It, it’s so delicious. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
chef my ass.. if you're going to brag about your culinary craft and make a detailed video of something,  at least get the proportions correct...what a putz
I made another persons version of orange chicken. Since I still have a LOT of orange juice left I think I will try this one in the next few days.
Guys, to NOT use 3 cups of flour for 2lbs of chicken. Thats way more than twice what you really need. Google a nice tempura batter recipe instead of this gummy slop
If only the actual restaurant used this much chicken for their recipe.  It's usually just flour inside
I was thinking of reducing some orange soda until it is a concentrated liquid syrup and using that instead of the sugar and orange from this recipe. Is this a bad idea? Because there is a certain flavour that comes from the syrup they use to make soda that is different than squeezed orange juice.
So easy but so tasty!
The batter is like glue ... not making this again
I dint have orange juice
The authentic recipe does not use orange juice or plain soy sauce. It is proprietary, and this is not it.
Hate to say this ,I brought the orange sauce at Walmart and purchased some chicken breast ,followed the wet flour recipe and it's almost done as I speak.
Done by Jimmy…. It’s certified folks..
Note: this does not taste like Panda Express orange chicken. Also, as others have mentioned, the proportions are all wrong.
❤
Made this tonight with some sauteed vegetables and rice. It was a hit.
Nice
Anybody else watching this knowing full well they don't have the ingredients for this and even if they did, they cannot be arsed to do it?
So this is the recipe I use since it was published and it comes out delicious every time.
I love this crisp just saying that right now
The amount of water measurement that is specified is incorrect.  The flour is still so thick that I needed to add water to get to the creamy state specified.
칠리 1/4컵,갈릭 1티스푼, 백설탕 1/4커1. 흑설탕 1/4컵.오렌지주스 1/4컵, 식초 1/4,간장 2tbsp,물 2tbsp, 전분물 2tbsp
I’m panicking because my Genius self added the flour, cornstarch, egg and water DIRECTLY into the bowl of chicken instead of making the batter first. I couldn’t go back or start again because I had used up all my chicken, so it’s chilling in the fridge right now. We will see how it goes…😞
i love there orange chicken
Yummy yummy
Can you please remove music from this video, we cant hear your recipe and instructions properly please  😊

I made this according to the recipe , it was horrible!!!   When you made the batter, it sure looked like you put more liquid in than the recipe calls for.   You better look over the recipe.
1" square cuts of chicken?  Not in any Panda Exprss I've been to.  Mostly breading and a small piece of chicken.
They have a AED too
If Trump can’t get who he needs, he only has the stupidity of his own actions to reflect upon.
It's tasty real good 👍

What kind of vinegar and soy sauce were used in this video?

I needed 3 cups of water not a cup and a half lol.. but otherwise I’m good and making this right now:m😊
Just make Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Chicken in an Air Fryer lined with aluminum foil. 10-minute meal with no cleanup.

To all vegans out there: I will try that with vegan chicken nuggets from the supermarket. Edit: The sauce is way too sweet.
This is what I needed thank you so much!!!!
Once i practiced on making this. I kept making just so I can perfect it. I haven't made it in months so now I'm making it for my friend. 😊

Duuuude!  I’m making this for dinner and already the chicken it out of this world!!! Taste exactly like panda!!!
Can I use regular orange juice.?
is that brown sugar or light brown sugar ?
Ilove there, kao Pao chicken..mmmm🎉🎉❤. M
i love orange chicken
We was in Houston Texas the past week for vacations and my friend bring us to Panda Express the next day when we arrive , and my daughter and wife loved that place so much that we went almost every day for a week straight to eat there, especially for the orange chicken for my daughter, the beef carnitas with vegetables for my wife and me, everything but I ate more the sweet chicken with sesame seeds and vegetable rolls. Everything very delicious. I want to learn those recipes to make for my daughter and wife in my country Costa Rica.🇨🇷
Wow! Too much sugar. I didn't know that.
ITEAWON VEGAN RESTUARANT HAS THE SAME MENU !
Are you serious when you say that “there’s no way to cheat Chinese food”? You should watch what they cooking up in the mainland… gutter oil, meat using tenderized leather shoes I mean the list goes on
sick recipe
2024 kk order ko lang matabang!!!!!
I love it how restaurants, and even the DDD food network show, demonstrate the exact way to make the dish. They have to know that 90% of people do not have the time and skill to do the dish, so they will always go back to the restaurant, driven by the show. The rest of us look, appreciate, and refine and make it. Yes, I even go to the restaurant when I am in a rush. But there is no harm in a restaurant sharing it's 'secrets'.
i love chinese foooooood!
As an Asian, it genuinely took me 2 years to realize panda express was tryna make
I tried it yesterday using chicken breast but might try later with thighs... i also let the chicken marinate with salt pepper and a bit of extra orange juice, added a tbsp of curry powder to the flour mix and it gave it an extra, it was delicious.

WHERES THE ORANGE???????????????????
This recipe is bs it doesn't turn out like that. There's way too much plain flour used.

Sounds like David Chang
what is white pepper. and can i just use black pepper?
Mmm, yummy 😋🧡🍗🧡🍽
God man looks so damn bomb! I have a huge order of orange chicken and rice every Friday for my cheat meals 😂😂 it's so bomb.
P
Rice vinegar or white vinegar? I made this last night… using rice vinegar with a slight color, but I’m watching the video again and the vinegar is clear! Also… I double fried my chicken. I made a large batch and needed to reheat and add a bit more color! And… I added A LOT more chili flakes, and tossed in some green onion! So good!
Watching this at 3 am when I can’t cook till later 😮
I guarantee you they didn't look like they had way more meat and were delicious 1999-2001 Panda Express original eater. This looks like crust
❤I love it!!!
Can I use honey instead of sugar?
Delicious  ...
I follow the recipe from the beginning to the final and OMG, exactly how he show in the video. Thanks
Egg replacement? I have an allergy
Excelente receta. Gracias.
Chinese people love those💕
Maybe Fix it or remove it…. You just ruined dinner… that’s what I get for listening to you I guess… unsubscribing
Can you please show how to make Panda Express “Chili Crisp Shrimp”?
Orange chicken and Panda Express are horrible.
You didn't even add orange ???!!!
❤❤❤❤
Panda Express doesn’t sell food
Can we use apple? Watermelon? Must be orange?
Thank you! Also, to everyone that commented the changes to make for the recipe!
Goddamn that look good
The man talks to much. Kills the video!!!
i will do like you 🤩🤩
@Tasty how about fixing the recipe error first?
I'm going to treasure this recipe forever ❤
Dude, I made this dish last night it is absolutely the best orange chicken I have ever had. Thank you..
This has been 5 years ago 😢❤
❤❤❤
🤍🤍🤍
I cooked it today and it was very delicious... my husband and my daughter loved it..Thank you so much chef God bless you 🙏..
The sesame oil will destroy all the orange smell.
Could i use an air fryer instead of oil?
It is hard to believe the chef who scrapes the cutting board with knife’s sharp edge, tho
Whats a substitute for corn starch? Its not available where I live.  😬
That’s it 😛 yum 😋
Thank you!!!!
Don’t add an extra cup of water..follow the recipe and it’s perfect..
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Did u see the amount of sugar?
What kind of vinegar, rice vinegar, or white vinegar?
1/4 cup of of vinegar just ruined the whole thing use 2 tbsp of vinigar instead
I feel like a wizard chef. So good.
Love how this guy says chinese food is precise yet if you follow the directions exactly for the battery is comes out nothing like his.
If you ever wanted to pretend you can cook chinese food this is the video for you. The hack behind the camera did no proper cooking methods. Didn't even double fry.
had p e in hawaii , it SUCKED !!!!!!!!!
I work at a food manufacturer that makes the Panda Express Sauces in bulk. As someone who deals with batch tickets, this is accurate.
Niiis 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
So i followed the recipe as strictly as i could, and it turned out really good, but 1) waay too oily (i know it’s not supposed to be healthy or anything, but still) 2) i feel like i only had enough sauce because I didn’t have as much meat  Other than that, it was pretty good, i’ll definitely try this sauce with other proteins
For those of you cooking only for a single person: even if you cook half as much meat as the recipe says, you will still get enough portions for like 3 days. I followed the recipe with only 750 g thighs (2lb is 900 g), and I’ll have to eat this chicken for a week🥲 (or maybe it will go bad sooner idk)
Im literally obsessed with this recipe I did it yesterday and turned out supper good even my children said they liked it
The music is on point, as is the recipe👌
Panda Express isn’t even worried about giving out their recipe. They know we’ll be to lazy to make it 😂
I followed as is the first time and then reduced the quantity of flour and corn starch. It was still v good
I have made this at least four times and every time it is so GOOD. My parents could never imagine an 11 year old making this, actually they can because I make a lot food. 😊🤣
Excelente receta
i’ve made this recipe twice, it’s rlly goood!! but can anyone confirm if it rlly tastes like panda express? there’s no panda express in my province so i can’t try for myself
I made this today, to say it's a banger is an understatement. I paired it with Thai fried rice, broccoli and carrots.
I LOVE Orange Chicken ❤
Thank you ! Lovely recipe ❤
Orange says" to cuyon toi" sounds like Aneeroud Jugnauth!! Isn't??  That's what his father taught him!! And his followers!!  Ok Aneerood, we'll talk after the END of this cycle!!  Let's sent this energies back to him, collectively!!  Backfire, Backfire, Backfire it on Pravin!! So be it, so be it and so it is!!  Backfire on the followers!!
Too much sugar at Panda express
We don't have Panda Express here in our country but we do have Foodpanda 😂
Nice presentation and attractive dish❤
So good and..relatively easy. Any better way to deal with the batter? I'll be halving the batter ingredients next time since a lot seemed to go to waste and made it harder to get the chicken into the fryer
So.. the orange is for display
After all that talking you picked it up with a fork? Where are the chopsticks?  Anyways, thanks for the recipe!
This recipe is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!! Measurements are way off.
You must try this recipe it is truly yummy and delicious.  Very easy for beginners.  🎉❤
As pregnant I had this craving since long time, and I am very grateful Panda Express shared this recipe, I followed it and WOW, me and my boyfriend ate the whole plate! THANK YOU!
Made it and can confirm, it is good. To keep the oil at 350, I had to keep the burner at medium high. Any lower and the chicken takes an hour to fry. Don’t wait for the chicken to finish frying before you start on the sauce.
For how much the people from the us love their inches and pounds i've never seen them acurately use them properly. Those chicken pieces were not even close to an inch, maybe half
This video  a troll, if you follow his method you will not get these results
that's chicken chilly but using the color that we use in chicken crispy
Damn I didn't know panda was the originator of orange chicken and I didn't know orange chicken was a recent as 1987
i accidentally forgot to add the oil in the batter, is it okay?
Thanks
Do u use Orange juice concentrate or dilluted?
Everybody is happy about this video apart from Panda express 😀
Omg I wasn't expecting it to be this simple 😭
I banned myself from eating at all  panda express.   They're not getting my business or money.  They fill the platter loaded with rice and one scoop of  meat and that's at all locations
Sonic 😂is the only Tyler
And fasel to 😢and was going through the same problem with
Sorry but this is so disgusting, can not relate how ppl say its better than the original.
If you remove the orange juice in this recipe, it’s called Chicken Manchurian, which is a popular street food in India and China.
I had to add an extra cup of water so that the “batter” didn’t become a dough, and this recipe makes about half as much sauce as you need, but it’s okay. Definitely not worth trashing my kitchen and spending two hours frying small batches since I don’t have a big pan, but yeah. I made it.
DELISH!!!
I'd love to know what brand/kind of orange juice he used. It seems like a minuscule detail yet a very important one.
heart attack speedrun
can we use packet orange juice?
Why are you cooking on the floor?
That’s not 3 cups of flour wtf
Is vinegar important? 1 of my family members is allergic to it
LOL Panda Express did NOT invent Orange Chicken, it existed many years prior. Delusional.
I don’t know if this is the exact recipe, I feel like they wouldn’t share ALL their secrets with us but I could be wrong 🤷‍♀️ worth a try though.
Chill as in putting it in the fridge?
Panda Express inventing orange chicken is such a powerful mood 😭
Me standing sweaty in my kitchen, chicken and oranges everywhere, frustrated because I didn’t know what AP flour was. “Why is there always some elusive ass ingredient!”
fry chicken only one time?
Thank you. A really awesome recipe!!
Cooking Chinese food on an induction ? You're kidding me
Anyone tried this with white meat like chicken breast?
Thank you,
Who’s watching this @ 3 am?
Can i use airfryer instead of boiling oil?
Add a tad bit more orange juice or vinegar and the sauce is pretty spot on. How the hell do you get it semi crispy? Mine turned out a bit crispy on the outside but soft and pillowy on the inside
Please use international measure standards, this American bs is a pain in the asssss to convert
My Chinese friend said this tastes nothing like the real deal
Can I use ground ginger and garlic granules instead?
Normal vinager or rice vinager I have both
Oh god... The auto translator did such a great job
SO GOD
1:45- yet whenever i or my parents cook, we approximate the measurements and that's what makes it sometimes unique
I personally thought the sauce was too sweet. I doubled the recipe, but used 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/2 and it was still too sweet for me. I had to cut it with more vinegar. Also, do not add all of the corn starch/water mixture to the sauce. This will make it kind of chalky and way too thick.
Looks like crap
I got a make it fancy ad on this video 😳
Crazy how he says nothing in Chinese food is processed but I was a manager at a panda at we fried processed chicken for the orange chicken. We weren’t battering in house.
Wow I wish the orange chicken I got from panda express actully looked and probably tasted that good tf and was even somewhat close to that amount of suacyness
Also like to add that if after frying the chicken (pre-sauce) the pieces aren’t as crunchy as desired, throw them into an air fryer for 4-5 minutes at 400. Came out great.
Panda Express is the originator of orange chicken my ass. That's just a marketing ploy to get easy suckers to eat dried out food.
I was out of the US and was missing Panda Express orange chicken forever😂 Made it today with this receptor …Was damn good.Thank u for sharing
So much sugar O.O
where did you get the white fried rice to go ceramic bowls? at 2:35
Too bad Panda Express hardly sauces their orange chicken and it is mostly dry...
Panda Express created orange chicken!? I had the idea that this dish was like waaay older than the Panda Express chain.
Nothing that says Panda Express you should sell...they're water taste like @sheit.
I dont know what to do rn i want soma that shi like RIGHT NOW but the panda express is far from where i live like its a 30 min drive ;-;
That was so well taught, excellent
Question please, would it work with leftover turkey?
Panda was NOT the originator of Orange Chicken. Try again.
The batter is a lie.  1 cup cornflour, 3 cups flour to 1.5 cups water creates cement, not a batter.  Just tried it.  Thick, stiff mass.
Now that I have the recipe, I shall open Rwanda Express
Well this was one of the videos that made the channel very famous!
Falta el aceite de ajonjolí
This is clearly an authentic Chinese dish
I got so excited to try this today I started cooking without realizing I was missing some ingredients. I had to substitute orange juice with lemon juice and the vinegar with rice vinegar. But it still tasted Exactly the same as Panda Express! This is amazing, I almost never need to go to Panda Express again now 😅
It takes audacity to call Panda Express chinese food.
I didn't have anything and I still make it work 🤣
基本上在国内没有见过的“中餐”哈哈哈 中餐应该不会这么做 不过确实是一个很好的给没吃过中餐的人的中间口味
been vegetarian for 7 years now and live in the uk for 9 years now but i remember how much i. use to love the orange chicken from panda express
Nice
never try it. I have tried to make a dinner for my familiy. So they disowned me. I feel really irremediable and I cry in the toilet 😭😭😭
I am Chinese & we don’t have this dish at all. Its a fake dish. 😅
THIS RECIPE IS LONG OLDER THAN THIS “RESTAURANT’!!!!
Fried chicken very bad for your health. Try cooking in water instead. And stir frying in a little bit of oil after. To reduce heartattacks
That's too much sugar
You just wasted my freakin flour!  This ingredient calls for at least one less cup of flour.  Who tried this and ended up with pizza dough.
What kind of orange juice? Juice from the orange or a store bought orange juice for kids?
Made it and its bussin asf 😍
Can you post a teriyaki chicken recipe
That's too much sugar!
Are you sure with 1.5 cups water,??? I needed 3 cups??
Hot damn
Hmmm is it worth it? A plate is only 13$ and comes with rice, will I be able to recreate it with that amount?  Last time I checked the chicken itself was 10$
So I gotta say this, the ratios in the batter are off. If you follow them to the letter then you will not get Batter. You will most certainly have to add more oil and water I’d double check the numbers.
Mmmmmm Orange chicken :D
I was like,  Where's the fkcin orange?
Ok just to say this is an amazing recipe!!!!! Just add 2.5 cups of water to the batter and also make double the sauce or just use less chicken
😋 Sooo good. I’m Australian 🇦🇺 so we don’t have Panda Express here, I haven’t anything to compare it to.. But it taste so good. A little sweet for my taste, next time I make it I won’t use as much sugars. It’s amazing with plain rice & stir fry vegetables 😊
I tried making this recipe batter twice. 1.5 cups of water is not enough water for 4 cups of dry ingredients. We had a bowl of dough not batter. please edit this video to put the correct measurements for ingredients. This was a waste of food!
I really like orange chicken.
I like very much this but you must have all the ingredients right to have this resold.  Please tell me one simple recipes  to have the MIT this way
Very good
Don’t think twice!!! Do this recipe right now! You won’t regret, and if you dont have white pepper, the black one is just fine. 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
Wow. Thank you
Mouth watering recipe wow
Does anyone have the correct flour ratios?
I just wasted a bunch of flour 🤦🏽‍♀️ the flour ratio is off
Add lime juice when you reheat it in the microwave.
Flour / cornstarch ratio is way off. Followed exactly and batter came out like bread dough. Had to add twice as much water and probably won’t turn out good. Rewatching the video and there’s no way he used as much flour and cornstarch as the subtitles say. Cut the flour and cornstarch I. Half
المقادير ما مضبوطة ، ٣ اكواب طحين وكوب نشا مع كوب ونص ماء اطلع العجينة ثقيلة جدًا
Anyone else have a problem with the wet batter becoming more of a dough I had to add way more water
Out of this world is the amount of sugar (white+brown)  @1:47 onwards
Is there a printable recipe for this?
Best dish I never cook before. My family loves this! ❤
What kind of oil is used for frying?
Taehyung join to the chat.
It looks delicious. What brand name of your pan to do this dish?
Ok but how do you make chow mein
I can't be the only non-american who thought this was airplane food
I tried to make batter with your recipe and it’s tooooo much flour for 1.5c water, it’s like dough, can make bread. Added more water…. PLEASE CORRECT RECIPE!!!!
This is an amazing recipe! turned out delicious, I don't even mind the fact that I made too much lol
Gonna try this recipe.
Anyone know what hot plate he is using??
Is this true to authentic way to cook orange chicken. I know Panda Express is far from the real deal. What i am asking his recipe here is it close to authentic ?
Perfect! I plan to apply to Panda soon and was gonna try a recipe first, so to find a recipe on how to make Panda’s orange chicken is not what I expected to find but excellent!
Did it twice and it went well, changed some amounts on the ingredients due to how much chicken I was doing, but it turned out amazing
i can't imagine how many people's batter got ruined because of the "3 cups of flour"....lol
Coleslaw sweet and sour don’t know about that
Every time i go to Chinese buffet i go for this chicken
Mina favourite recipe 🧡
Can you bake the chicken instead of frying it?
I tried this but instead of using chicken, I've used soya chunks. It was AMAZING 🤩🤤🤤🤤
Great Video! Love it!
In the UK we dont measure in cups so could someone please tell me what a cup is in Grams please
DO NOT FOLLOW THIS INSTRUCTION!!! Wrong on his measurements! I should have read the comments before just following along. Batter mix is way off.
1. The recipe for the batter is wrong. Cut the flour and corn starch in half. Keep the rest the same. Maybe 1 3/4 cups of water. 2. The recipe for the sauce is only enough for half the chicken you just made. Make two batches worth of sauce. 3. This is a ton of chicken. If you’re cooking for two, cut everything in half.
I made this but substituted the sugars for honey it was soo good def recommend
Delicious and yummy 😋
Music is too loud. I have to focus so much to hear what you say.
What oil should I fry in?
Thank you
Im going try to make it. So far I buy it at Costco ready
I always watch these food videos during Ramadan
Sauce Measurement begins at 1:36
Batter Measurements begin at 0:28
just finished making it. it’s really good and tastes exactly like Panda Express BUT it takes so damn long to prepare/cook
Orange chicken with no orange 🙂 my whole life is a lie
PLZ don't fry if you've never fried before (coming from someone that has never fried before until Today) seriously my first chicken turnt out burnt and the oil started smoking (cuz oil was too hot) and I had to get my dad (who had experience) to step in :'''(  results: oil will splatter no matter what while it's frying (pain) (suggestion: get longer chopsticks or wear long gloves) my eyes got irritated from the smoke (pain) (suggestion: set up a fan to blow it away) and the whole kitchen got oily (major pain) (suggestion:... idk send help)   additional suggestions: get a kitchen thermometer (to check the temp of the oil to get the ideal temp) , don't use olive oil for frying, get someone who knows how to fry to supervise u, go in with an open mind, it's fine if u fail...  I'll probably come back to try frying again next year... ｡･ﾟﾟ･(>д<)･ﾟﾟ･｡
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful 😍
Making this dish right now!! Thank you for sharing. ❤
Daddy of cooking chicken !
Can I marinate the chicken in the batter for a day or two in the refrigerator would that be okay? Anyone try that?
This is my recipe standard whenever I cook Orange Chicken. Tastes superb :D
Vengo a dejar mi comentario con respecto a esta receta y debo decir que después de probar con muchas recetas para hacer el Orange chicken esta es la mejor de todas por lejos, es grandiosa y si sabe al de panda express que es lo que buscaba, muchas gracias, a todos les encantó y esta receta se va al primer lugar de mis favoritos.  Solo que quisiera decir que le acomode un poquito a la receta, le puse menos harina y le fui agregando agua hasta que quedara la mezcla adecuada y listo, y de la salsa puse doble de todo para que cubriera mejor todas las piezas del pollo y fue todo, quedo perfecto! La voy a recomendar con todos mis conocidos que desean hacerlo! Gracias de nuevo!
Has anyone tried this chicken in an air fryer?
I made this tonight and it is very tasty, not quite like our local panda express but really good and I will make this often!  I did cut the flour and corn stretch in half, I used 3 pounds of chicken thighs, and I tripled the orange sauce and there was just enough of everything!
Nice recipe
1 inch cube gives great texture? Texture isn't decided by shape. The texture is provided by corn starch. Any dredge is crust. Corn starch provides the best texture. Ketchup isn't sweet and sour
Time to make an attempt at orange tofu. Wish me luck!
Making this rn.. great recipe 💖
Short and precise. ❤️ Easy to follow. Thanks!
Metric / global stats pls
I just made this and I’m eating it as I write this, OMG!!! This is better than Panda Express! I Impressed myself! This is absolutely delicious …thank you for this recipe! Best ever!
Best recipe just like Panda Express thanks 🙏
They lied 🤥 to us
Midnkkiwgs,ltwmoye
Muyi, Awesome!!!!!
Maybe you could SLOW TF DOWN!!!!
Hi, do u know hoe much sodium roughly is in this sauce?
Mmm it was great! I made it without peper
I just made these tonight! Delicious! Only thing: when you drop your chicken into the oil. make sure you move and stir them right away because they clump up VERY fast! Otherwise, tastes great!
I should’ve read the comment before making the “ wet batter “  it wasnt wet at all but i did add more water . I honestly don’t think he used regular flour tho . Still not funny it’s currently in the refrigerator for 30 mins
What can i use as substitute for brown sugar... Can someone tell plz??
So much sugar! Unhealthy 🤢
I made this and it was probably the best thing ive ever made its better than fast food
Wonderful upload delicious recipe i love it Amazing 👌👏👌🌷🌷💕
Thanks for sharing this recipe. I adore these flavors and can eat it everyday 😋
Modified recipe! (Thanks to y’all in the comments. Basically I just halved the batter, used less of the flour and more water, removed the sesame oil, and doubled the sauce)  Chicken: 2 lb chicken (thighs) 1/2 tbsp salt 1/2 tsp white pepper 1/2 cup cornstarch 1 cup flour 1/2 egg 1 cup water 1 tbsp oil  Sauce: 2 tsp vegetable oil 1/2 tsp chili flakes 1 tsp ginger  2 tbsp garlic 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar  1/2 cup orange juice 1/2 cup vinegar 4 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp water+2 tbsp cornstarch mixed together (you may not need all of it, I’d say try and add it in slowly)  To make it: Cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes. Set aside. In a bowl, whisk the salt, white pepper, cornstarch, and flour together. Add the egg and the water. Whisk well to combine. Mix in the oil. Mix the chicken with the batter, and put it in the fridge for 30 minutes. Heat a pan with oil to 350F. Use tongs to gently place the chicken into the oil. Fry in batches, and make sure you fry the chicken for at least 6 minutes, or until golden brown.  Add oil, chilli flakes, ginger, garlic, both sugars in a pan. Turn the heat on (medium-low ish) and stir it. Add in the orange juice, let it boil a bit. Add the vinegar and soy sauce, and when it’s boiling add in the water-cornstarch slurry slowly, while stirring. You may not need all of the slurry. Keep on stirring it until the sauce thickens, and add in the chicken. Stir, until the chicken is coated.  Serve while hot.
I tried it and it was amazing!
The recipe is excellent. It is a staple in my house. A couple of small changes that I personally made: water in batter according to feel,used lemon juice instead of vinegar,   more orange juice at the end to dilute the batter - approximately 1 cup total. Simply delicious.  Thanks!
❤️
in india we dont have panda express , especially in my state , lovely taste , its my favorite now , thank you for sharing
MASTER OF FOOD MAKE ME SUBSCRIBE INCREDIBLE STUFF
I did it and it was just awesome
Wish this could made without so much sugar, and Vegetable oils/sesame oils. Horrible for you.
Made this tonight and added some msg to the batter and some more to the sauce half a tea spoon to both and it was brilliant thanks for the recipe  it is amazing 👍 cut down on the flour by about a cup
dal bych si jak zmrd congu nebudu lhat
You are awesome, so simple and so tasty!
first off im removing all the fat from the chicken
I want some now! 😫
"There is no way to cheat Chinese food." This is American food, this dish does not exist in China
Taehyung is typing.....
For the lazy ppl like myself they sell the orange chicken sauce n the grocery store in the international aisle you're welcome
So orange chicken without orange cool bro
I love this recipe. I’m going to make your recipe TY
That's a lot of calories
I’ve been searching for the perfect recipe to replicate the exact Panda Express orange chicken and this is SPOT ON! I’m so glad to have stumbled across this video, my husband said it was the best orange chicken he ever had. One tip is to add more water to the batter 👍🏻
Hey what kind of flour you use
How about the Chicken Teriyaki recipe, please?
my dad wouldn't hold me just took off the training wheels and i just went down hill for a week and it not on a side walk it was off road and grassy and bumpy and THANK GOD FOR THAT TRAINING METHOD cause now i can control the bike better off road thanks dad.
Recipe is gas! Can be easily modified to your needs.
I have no cornstarch what do I do
Eat only food in which the Lord God of Israel commanded.   Proverbs 23:2 Put a knife to your throat if you are a man given to appetite.  If you are a man with an appetite, you need to control your sugar, fat, and salt intake. It is very unhealthy to your health. Salt can make your blood pressure high. Sugar imbalance your hormones, and fat clog the artery. BE CAREFUL IN THE WORLD. GREEED OF MONEY AND FAME ARE ONLY THE MATTER NOWADAYS IN THE HEART OF GREEEDY PEOPLE.   The Spirit and the bride Mount Zion, Heavenly Jerusalem  Gabriel, an angel of the Lord
Please note when making sauce fo not add to much corn starch it will be stringy  if it happen just add more juice or water and mix
What kind of orange juice is required? Can I use a bottled orange juice like Tropicana?
Didn't understand the recipe so fast the explanation
woah! so there's no orange in orange chicken :3
That’s weeeally good 🤪
Looks delicious😍😍😍😋😋😋😋😋
Not the right measurements.
good show
I just made this, and it was amazing!! i am not a stick to the recipe type of cook, but I did with this and it turned out amazing!!
Just made this! My whole family and I loved it! My husband was mad impressed! 😂❤️ Only note (others have mentioned it too) the flour and corn starch ratio to water was waaaayyyy off. Made me think I was making biscuits 😅 but quick fix, just add more water or less flour. But it was overall really good! 👍💕
With minor changes, this has been the best thing ive tasted omg!!!!!! my whole family loved it and finished it within minutes
Every time i eat panda express it tastes like someone farted in my mouth
Jokes on you I straight up went and bought the official Panda Express Orange Chicken sauce, poured it on a pan, cooked it hot, added some crushed red pepper, and zinga! I was finished and it was amazing!
This seems awesome 👍gonna try it
Wow
Wat kind of soy souce
Looks so awesome! I'd really be interested in the sesame ginger too 😁 it's my favorite ❤️😁🤷
Great
Next time i go to the city in the upper half of the state, i want to try it. Even though the Chinese restaurant where i live may have it, i never been lucky enough to ever get any because its always gone 🤣🤣🤣
1.  If you're eating only for 1 or 2 people, that sauce will be enough.  If it's a family of 4 or more, double your sauce recipe. 2.  The batter should be equal parts flour and water.  2 cups should be sufficient. 3.  That cornstarch slurry will make your sauce very very thick.  Personally,I would do 1 TBSP cornstarch and 1 TBSP water.   4.  If you use a pot on the stove with oil, your chicken will take a long time to fry up. 5.  It probably wouldn't hurt to saute up some onions and peppers and maybe some mushrooms things like that to put over top of your finished dish. I think it would just add to it.
Now this is orange chicken
Try using concentrated frozen orange juice to really enhance the flavor. And the batter mix is off more water less flour. I have made it both ways  using the same amount of frozen orang juice 1/4 cup takes it to the next level
watching this and all i can think about is our gorl
learning for cook this to my love taehyung who loves panda express
Mashalla this recipe definitely I will try stay blessed a Thank you for sharing
This is THE WORST copy cat PANDA EXPRESS ORANGE CHICKEN  recipe!!!!! And it's FROM PANDA EXPRESS!!!  They did this on purpose so you don't really get your fix by cooking it yourself.....they want you to go to their restaurant!!!!!!
It's torture watching before sleep
Made this. It's super obvious that the flour/water amounts in the recipe are wrong. Y'all gonna fix this? @tasty
good food
It looked so delicious 😋when you ate I wanted to help you clear that large plate!
I love the storytelling
Cummed my pants
I can't believe  I wasted ingredients and time twice before reading the comments and realizing that the amounts aren't correct sheesh.
Learning this so I can cook for my wife after both of us had our hard days work
I tried this recipe and 1 cup of cornstarch and 3 cups of flour was way too dry. I just added more water
so many ingredients...
Nice
So many steps to follow. I'll just get take outs
Who is here for Tae and Chim?
this is not how it’s made tho-
I tried it and it didn’t taste like it at all
*"I LovE pAnDa ExpReSs!.. OoH!"* - kim taehyung

I am in love
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)

Here is the recipe if anyone is wondering:  Chicken breast Salt  Flour Cornstarch  1 egg Water White or black pepper Oil   After you let the chicken chill in the batter for 30 minutes put it in the oil not on high heat but low  The sauce   Vegetable oil Chili flakes  Ginger Garlic Sugar Brown sugar Vinegar Soy sauce Water Cornstarch Sesame oil
We love chicken that way..thanks ..
This is called Chinese chilly chicken in india
Did they purposely mess up the recipe so we’re not able to make it right or how could they mess up measurements this bad?
i'm hungry
I've always wanted to cook this, and today's the day ! Also, can I use Paneer (Cottage Cheese) as substitute for chicken ? (Veg. Option)
I thought orange chicken had sesame seeds sprinkled on top?
do you use light or dark brown sugar?
i made this and it’s super good but without the sesame oil… way too overpowering
The flour to water ratio is not correct! More like 4 cups of water to make it look like the video!
As a Panda Express cook I can say this recipe is very accurate
Great recipe for once again there's a major mistake in the portions. There needs to be added at least a cup and a half of more water to this mixture if not you're going to end up with a big ball of flour. The other thing I did was I let the chicken sit in the mixture for about an hour and that coded the chicken batter.
This recipe is good but 3 things 1 use a bit less flour  2 use a little less vinegar than the recipe  3 if you want a little more flavor use a tablespoon or 2 of orange marmalade in the sauce
i love your recipe
CURSE YOU AND YOUR WAY OF MAKING ME HUNGRY TO THE POINT OF EATING RIGHT AFTER CAUSE YOUR FOOD LOOKS SO GOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!
Today I amazed my wife thank you!
I tried this recipe, it calls for more water than 1 1/2 cups.
i made this, its really good yall
Who is here after listening taehyung That he love panda express any army
Looks so yummy
I love that
Im doing it today
After mixing the chicken with batter I go chill for half an hour but my chicken doesnt turn out the same. Why??
Do not follow this recipe, the measurements are all wrong, find yourself a responsible youtuber who doesn't  keep a video posted even if it has mistakes in them.
Chinease food is fake chicken
I've never tried orange chicken but i'm going to attempt to make it today! It'll be interesting to see how the orange flour works with fried chicken
oh wow
Me with no Panda Express in my country  Wow!
✨🙃🔥
There is no sesame oil in Panda Express's orange chicken.
Idk why!! But for an Indian its too sweet as chicken dish....I guess🤔
For me this is the best panda Express menu, will try this thanks for sharing!
Tried this recipe. Worked perfect. Family loves it. Thanks for sharing 👍
1 tsp Vegetable oil  1/4 tsp chili flakes 1/2 tsp ginger  1 tbsp garlic 1/4 cup Sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar  1/4 cup orange juice 1/4 cup vinegar 2 tbsp soy sauce  2 tbsp water + 2 tbsp cornstarch 1 tsp sesame oil
Kim Taehyung : I love panda Express
panda express is chinese food for not chinese people
im hungry
Too much work, imma just go at my Chinese food place, they pack it up lol
I love Panda Express sm🤤
Looks so yummy😛
Could I do it with almond flour?
you are going to have to change the name of the WHITE PEPPER to Privleged Pepper
I made it today and yesterday it’s so good I even made it with some fried rice and vegetables
now that I am making the recipe there is no way in HELL 1.5 cups of water is enough to make the batter that liquidy
That's looks delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe
1 tsp oil 1/4 chili flakes ginger 1/2 garlic 1 tbsp sugar 1/4. up orange juice 1/4 vinegar 1/4 soy sauce 2 tbsp water 2 tbsp Cornstarch
Seems easier to just buy Panda tbh
Can cornflour be used instead of cornstarch
Add Sesame at last😮😮😮
I bought panda express orange sauce. Now all I have to do is fry the chicken. 😁
When people say in cooking vids "after this, you Will never buy the things in a store ever again"  It isn't bout the taste, it is that we are too lazy
1 Tsp - Veg Oil 1/4 Tsp - Chili Flakes 1/2 Tsp - Ginger 1 Tbsp - Garlic 1/4 Cup - Sugar 1/4 Cup - Brown Sugar 1/4 Cup - Orange Juice 1/4 Cup - Vinegar  2 tbsp- Soy saue 2 tbsp + 2 tbsp - water + cornstarch  1 tsp - sesame oil
There’s barely any orange
wow so yummy ❤💙💜💚
Is it legal?
Now your making me hungry🤤🤤🤤🤤
I used breast meat and it came out just fine! Also I only put like 3/4 of the sugar and it tasted sweet enough. I guess it’s supposed to be sweeter but it tasted great not being at the full sugar level
Who else clicked this video after thinking of tae?
this is not the correct recipe for orange chicken at all 😂😂
1:38  You could just buy a bottle of Panda Express orange sauce.
I'm gonna make this for Tae...     (In my dreams)
Can we make this with chicken breast instead?
What kind of oil?
What type of oil did you put on the chicken also what type of oil to fry?
It's almost 2am and I am craving spicy chicken
I am here because I need to cook it for my husband (V) because he loves panda express 😏
Can I fry the chicken in a deep fryer and for how long and what temp
I LOVE orange chicken
Panda Express: an Chinese restaurant  Me who has been living in a Chinese environment all my life and has never heard of orange chicken
the vi- what ?
If there's one thing I learned from Korean cooking videos is that double frying your chicken is always better 👌🏻
AmberLynn, please make this and compare it to Orange Chicken from Cheesecake Factory 😂
How the hell did it not get clumpy literally it was like clay and followed completely I had to add more water
Made this today and omg
Jesus Christ is king and he is coming back soon turn to him before its too late please 🙏❤️
👋🏻👋🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🥰🥰💐💐💐😋😋😋😋😋
Made this and the sauce was great! Though I didn’t like the batter because it wasn’t crispy. Next time I’ll stick to my own batter using this sauce 😌
I love chinese food made by chinese people I love the Chinese food
This is so good
Please fix this recipe! There is no way to make a batter out of 4 cups of dry ingredirnts with only 1 1/2 cups of liquid!
Panda too much ..But it's fast and convienent..Fast food Chineese taste..So So..
im watching while ordering
I love this food. I always buy a double serving at Panda express. I like to add peanuts, extra sesame oil and some hot sauce. I also like it crispy. Maybe I'll add a little Iron Chef General Tsao's sauce too. I'll make it at home but I'll still buy it a Panda Express when I'm near one. Finally the real recipe. None better. The best side dish for this is more Panda Express Orange Chicken.
wait is it okay if i didnt put sesame oil? or i rlly need to put it?
Is this same as 宫保鸡丁 ？like the one I had in 北京
Orange chicken is older than that we’ve had it since the 60s it’s an American tradition and stop giving these crazy chain restaurants credit for nothing but stealing other peoples intellectual property
Can someone tell me how many mL is 1 cup?
OMFG I tried this and it tasted amazing 😭😭😭
I came here after watching Amberlynn Reid eating plates upon plates of Orange chicken. Lets see what the fuss is about 🤣
Omflippingfatoosh thankyou ty ty ty tasty so much. I was planning on using the snoop dogg orange chicken recipe tomorrow cuz I was craving it😫😩😩this is literally AHHHHHHHHWWWW PRRFECT TYG

Orange chicken is my all time favorite this looks amazing I'm totally making this!
Orange sweet
I have more cravings than a pregnant women holy crap
How to do without air frier ?

I fry it regular with just salt and pepper and flour then make the sauce. Less mess and less time consuming. Still tastes fabulous
ok so I will make it and feed taehyung 😍🐯
Didn't really follow the exact measurement for the wet batter since it became dough-ish like. I spiced this one til my ancestors said stop.
I don’t have to spend money on panda anymore 😂 ❤️
I made this and it’s amazing
what is orange chicken?
Hmmmm!!! I gotta to make this. Thank u
You're really good!
At the end of your video is when I was convinced that it’s good cause you showed your face.
I’m making  this today I’m so hyped
Woooh  panda express  Wooh! hoo!                                           -Taehyung(aka, worlds most handsome man)💜
What do I do with a pot full of oil, that is left over?
I been made this making it again tonight with dumplings and white rice the only thing needed is 2.5 cups of water everything else he on the money it’s a great dish that’s y I turned back to your channel to make this again tonight 💥
Yum cats and dogs
That looks absolutely amazing, incredible and appetizing.Thanks for sharing this yummy and tasty recipe. Do  support my channel as well
That looks absolutely amazing, incredible and appetizing.Thanks for sharing this yummy and
nappie
Who wants panda after watching this video
this is a fake recipe, binging with babish just debunked it. between this and the fluffy japanese pancake recipe, i wonder how many fake recipes are on this horrible channel
coming back here after binging with babish started bashing on this recipe lol
Looks amazing, but i don't have most of the ingredients 😂
Why you don't cook all of the fried chopped chicken thighs?
Cool
Did I miss something? It turned into dough for me.
So, sooo bad; yet so good!! 😁
Hey guys, when cutting the chicken, is it okay if you remove all the fat and just cook with the meant, or do you NEED the fat?
i think i need some extra rice😁
Just made this. Listening to the other commenters, I adjusted the water and flour amounts in the batter, and made double the sauce. End result tasted really similar to what you really get from Panda Express today.
Can they please make another video with a correct recipe? It's been 3 years lol
WOW This is great...I agree with using less flour...I used seltzer water YUM!
I just made this and omlll new favoriteeeeee
Tried this and ended up with pizza dough instead of batter. Reading a lot of the comments to fix but find it odd that doesn’t happen in the video.
so isnt the gravy for the orange chicken like teriyaki sauce ?
I'm in love! Try adding the zest of an orange when you add the OJ and again when it's all done. FIRE! I find myself always adding or tweaking a recipe and that zest took it to another level!
Next time I'll just pay the $15 for the real thing....this was a nightmare to make 🙈
This is special
tasty recipes
I actually saw the chicken frozen at Panda Express
making me so hungry now
You are  Super  ! ! !   Good  Luck  ! ! !   Thank  you  so  much  for  this  video
I watch the video very well. Always be healthy.
Amberlynn Is gonna come for that
great recipe .. Please have a look at my recipes too :) Big Thanks
I made this exactly the way he did and it was awful 😅
1 tsp oil 1/2 tsp ginger 1 tbsp garlic 1/4 cup brown and white sugar 1/4 cup orange juice and vinear 2 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp water and cornstarch
im wet
What can I used instead of flour. As I cannot have gluten.
It’s THE best!!! Other recipes look so dry but these turned out glossy and sticky. Delish!! 😋

Wow just made it.....soooo good
my favorite
Imagine, tilting the entire bowl and dropping everything at once for frying 😀😂😛
😊😊
Guys I make this so much all the time, it turns out awesome!!! It’s the best recipe half I found it!!! If you want to make it I really recommend it! 🙃
how many servings does this recipe feed
Taehyung"I love panda expires "                        Yes that's why I came here.
"Everyone thinks fast food is processed, but with Chinese food there is no way to cheat it" he says as he dumps in a metric ton of sugar
This amount of sauce is enough for about ~5.lbs of chicken fyi.
What type of vinegar did he use??
deep fried, and the sauce is mostly sugar. hehe I finally understand why this stuff tastes amazing. I'm gonna have a go at this in my wok.
Do not make! this is pathetic and doesn’t work at all. if you want good orange chicken check out Joshua Weissman’s but better recipe, sooo much better.
2cuos of oil in the batter when is going to fried?
Guys, im an ARMY, but......Tae doesn't own eating panda express. Please appreciate the hard work of this video
Gonna make this for valentines.  I keep thinking about this chicken...so good!
Came back to say, I've cooked this four times since the start of quarantine, and it's a family favourite!
Honestly this recipe is one of the best ones out there but I did tweak a few things here and there which made it so much better!!  I used 700gms of boneless skinless chicken breast which is approximately 4 1/2 number of chicken breasts used :)  1. Firstly the batter, I actually made my own batter and it tasted so so so good so if you want an easier one just follow this: for 700gms of chicken I used 1 1/2 cup of flour with 1/2 cup of cornflour and a generous sprinkle of salt and black pepper, I then directly put my chicken into the dry mixture and coated it evenly. After that i added water accordingly. This ensures that the coating actually sticks to the chicken and since you add the water accordingly, you won't have excess batter that has to be dumped! then cover and chill for 30 mins before frying, like they said!  2. For the sauce, since  used 700gms of boneless and skinless chicken breast, I honestly just eyed the proportions for everything because i saw a comment which said that the quantity of sauce they make is only good for like 200gms of chicken. so I put like a tablespoon and a quarter of oil and a spoon full of chilliflakes. Added a small spoon full of garlic paste and a spoon full of ginger garlic paste! and then added 3 big spoons of white sugar and 1 and a half spoon of brown sugar, followed by 1/4 cup or orange juice and 1/4 cup of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. made a cornstarch slurry and added two spoons of it (just eye this part)  once it starts to thicken add the chicken and top it off with toasted sesame seeds. I skipped the sesame oil cause I didn't have it on hand but yes it tasted just as good without it.   This is so foolproof!! do let me know if you try this!! it worked for me and i hope it works for you:)
Capitalism America loves sugar. Sugar: it’s a great way to flip your money and get people addicted.
👌
dam looks good
I tried this recipe and it’s amazing 😍 The flavors really show through. I was wondering how it would taste this good cuz there’s very little ingredients but it turned out well. Definitely making this again
🌹饿了饿了
I made this yesterday and took all the suggestions in comments. I made half the batter and I used 1 cup flour and 1 cup water and 1/2 cup cornstarch rest of the ingredients were exactly half. Amazingly crispy.. then I doubled the quantity of sauce because its 2 pound chicken and the video quantity wasnt enough for so much chicken. It serves 6 people easily.  I added sesame seeds generously and topped with finely chopped green onions. Green onions accentuated the orange flavour which was just so delicious. . Tastes 😗 *chef's kiss*
Omg it looks Delicious 🤤🤤
When you said 2tbs of water+2 tbs of cornstarch I thought you meant to put it all in... now mine has a consistency of jelly🤮
Yum
I LUB FANDA EXPRESSEU WOOW
Support local businesses and restaurants.  The food usually tastes better too.
Omg this was the most amazing orange chicken recipe I have tried. I wish I had seen it before spending my non existent fortune on Panda Express!!!
I added the right amount of water and it looked nothing like that
I work at panda and this makes me happy
Taste like cat
Any substitute for brown sugar?
Avril Lavigne when she expressed herself about frozen pizza
I did this and the batter receipe is so off i followed it to a T and it was super sticky like cookie dough not pancake batter
Ok iiniiii inning iiii ii
I've had this before. I'd say the recipe is pretty accurate, but the batter texture is just kinda off.
Hahaha😂
I was really in to this until he added a huge amount of white and brown sugar to the dish. 😨
GUYS LITSEN I MADE IT AND IT WAS NOT COOKED INSIDE  *WARING DONT DO THIS*
but Orange Chicken is not Chinese Food
Why would they tell u their recipe
Noob at cooking here, the recipe says to let the chicken chill for 30 minutes before frying, does that mean chill in the fridge? I was reading that it’s a BAD idea to deep fry chicken straight from the fridge? I’m confused now!
Dark meat  ...??? They hv good orange chicken but I call it KF🐼😋😋
For anyone wondering , or has any questions I made this today! It’s super amazin!!
anyone frustrated that he didn’t top them up with sesame seeds?
When there is no ORANGE in Orange chicken
Godly recipe.
In other words sweet and sour chicken with fresh orange juice.  Reminds me of a famous quote ’If my grandmother had wheel she would have been a bike’
Secret: sugar 😂😂Looks So healthy. I'd rather add MSG
The tested tailor clearly crush because recorder contrastingly matter throughout a pink crowd. shallow, pricey beaver
No matter how much I love it, but its Not Chinese food.
Amberlynn reid : no cheesecake factory
Here I'm watching food by panda express and the ad before was zomato...
Hmm, it doesn't look nearly as crunchy as it usually is.
Made this last night and it was incredible! Texture was just perfect. Thank you!
The sad thing is that panda actually uses pre-made chicken,  I've seen it many times
me: hears Panda Express  also me: Kim Taehyung
Very fantastic and wonderful dish, thanks for sharing
Panda express remind me of Taehyung 💜😁
I know the reason behind the caption panda express--teahyung❤️
It's the best video ever which came in my recommendation 🎉🎉🎉🎉
After watching 12 recipes on a hungry stomach I’m finally choosing to make this one
THANK YOU FOR THIS 😩❤️
Tomorrow’s dinner !!!!! 👍🏻🙏🏻
I'm feeling really hungry  right now watching this.
We have recipe but we not all of us chefs and want to spend the effort of making it. So we still gonna buy it.
Tasty n mouth watering 🤤🤤🤤
That was one of the most appetizing recipes 😋
most importantly what oil did he use??
Me when I saw this: *Neuron Activation*
It looks like honey chicken with orange essence
Hi. Thanks for this wonderful recipe. Why do we have to put it inside the fridge before frying? Thanks
Not me watching this when there's bird flu in my country 😷 Have to wait to try this recipe 😉😋
I don’t even like sweet stuff and I love this dish!
M was here to watch thinking i will never go panda express again but.....             I never made it
Think y’all meant 3 cups of water instead.
I LOVE PANDA EXPRESS. WoOOoW -Kim Taehyung.
If you follow this recipe to the letter it's absolutely awful. The batter is WAY too thick and does not result in crispy chicken. Tasty please warn people here.
so there really is no oranges
I miss this food. Sadly panda express no longer available in my country. 😭💔
Panda is Trash
Anyone have the Orange Chicken from Trader Joe’s?
oh cool, I can make Chinese American fastfood at home (I'm not American)
Finally i beat the first specification to be Taehyung's wife
This is basically Indo-Chinese style chicken manchurian without peppers and spring onions
Panda Express is so disgusting especially the orange chicken
Isn't this basically pai kut Wong but chicken 😂
I tought it was a how to basic video until i saw the chanel name 😂
May i know whether the soysauce used in this recipe is a salty or the sweeter type of soysauce? Tqsm 🙌🙌🙌🙌
Lying to sleep on an empty stomach not being able to afford food for the day and watching this didn't go well for me lol
Watching this while exercising for weight loss was such a bad idea. I've suddenly become a chef. Goodbye to my weight loss
thank you...i  am not eating this again....its basically calling for high BP , Diabetes. with several stomach diases
Panda Express WOO.      Panda Express WOO
Chili chicken with orange juce😑
Watching this while on a diet is tough.
Can we use normal sugar instead of brown sugar??
wtf half a cup of sugar
Ooh baby... my favorite food
Tried it and it was really good suggest to try it
Where is the msg
This looks so delicious but there are so many ingredients, which I would not even find in shops
watching this in 2021 and it still makes me crave
I'm a vegan but I wanna eat this so bad. I'm gonna try this dish with tofu. Anybody has something else in mind would like yo recommend?
But whenever I go to panda press whenever I go to panda Express excuse me I always eat there and I noticed there orange chicken is white not the dark meat and it's a little bigger and thicker you have to show us how to how they make their noodles of chow mein and why they don't make it with shrimp and vegetables that's the best part
Yeah... just call it American fast food and I may actually like it because of lower expectations...
I didn't read it correctly I thought we where cooking panda
He says its made fresh but every time I eat it, I feel like I ingested dish detergent. Nope. I always go authentic when I get Chinese food.
I love the walnut shrimp the best.
Orang-inal
That much Orange Chicken at Panda Express will cost about $37.89 +tax
Can you guys do tai chilli chicken I love the chicken at wings stop the flavor is amazing
I watch this everyday in the hopes I get to taste something other than radishes and whole wheat bread
Orange chicken is not Chinese food and panda express is not Chinese restaurant. That knew from different cooking channels
Is the orange flavour reaaally noticeable or no? I hate orange in food🤣
He used a chicken and bathed it into its own children. Don’t tell the vegans
That whole story is a lie
Can anyone who made this tell me if it actually tasted like the Panda Express chicken plz??🙏
Who has the recipe typed out???
BTS favourites come from here 💜
Panda Express sells their sauce in bottles now.
panda express😆🤙
That chicken looks sexy ong
I believe that this dish is actually Chinese however it's more well known here in the US and other western countries.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯
The FIRST thing I learned in culinary school was to NEVER cut meat on a wooden Cutting Board.  ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use a plastic one or you have the risk of getting salmonella.
kinda pricey
M m m
Am I only one who’s mouth is watering right now?!
me : *sees panda express in title* also me : remembers V panda express wo panda express
Orange chicken has no oranges
Nice! I'll be eating mu discount air.
It’s kinda disappointing that the Panda Express doesn’t have any panda meat btw don’t ask them for it, just don’t.
I love this recipe it is so delicious and it was so crunchy and I have no words it’s delicious please try❣︎❣︎
i’m eating panda express rn...
For foodies with gluten allergies.  Does this recipe work at all with gluten free flour?
I say unto thee, Except a be born of water and of the spirit , he can not enter the kingdom of God. John 3:5 , find Jesus.
who are the 3.9k fools who DISLIKE this video?
Ok that’s good but I need the teriyaki chicken recipe          Pls!!
I LOVE PANDA EXPRESS- KIM TAEHYUNG
Only here because of Weissman.
😋 yummy 🤤
What, this is actually easy to make?
Never had panda express. Ill try the recipe and see for myself c:
Panda Express is overrated
so can i use chicken breast
I see now why taehyung from bts love this so much 😂
Now I get why Taeyhung likes this soo much Understatement loves panda express soo much
No one:  Me praying I have all the ingredients at home...
I am vegetarian. I have no clue why im watching this!!!
As a Chinese guy, I’ve never, *ever* eaten or even seen Orange Chicken in my life.
So goooood. Now I’ve got a craving.....
Total BS.  He is a liar.  Panda Express was not the originator of Orange Chicken in 1987.  We were serving orange chicken and orange beef back in the 1970's in my parents' restaurant.  And, we used real orange peels in our recipe, not orange juice. Also, we used white breast meat, not dark meat.  Orange Chicken and Orange Beef originated in the Hunan Province in China, not here in the US.
The food looks delicious
Taehyung must be eating this everyday
I am a panda 🐼 employee and I can tell you it’s Not the original recipe, but very alike to the original though. Good job!
lol panda express is frozen ass chicken.
How much is a cup in grams?
TY a wonderful video! It educates us to the history and techniques to be able to achieve a true copycat of the original!
Fake Chinese food full of grease
RAM RAM 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Yumm!
Video title paraphrased: The Original Donald J. Trump by Panda Express
Lol! Yes, it is really good.
Panda express      Reminds me of someone
its simple, i see delicious food, i like
Guys make sure u pat the chicken DRY
That looks good
The music sounds liek scoops doo music
Can I use Jaggery powder instead of  Brown Sugar
What is panda Express exactly?
Me wanting to do this but still doesn’t taste good cuz I’m never precise enough
CHICKEN  2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs(905 g) 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon white pepper 1 cup cornstarch(125 g) 3 cups flour(375 g) 1 egg 1 ½ cups water(360 mL) 2 tablespoons oil 6 cups oil(1 ½ L), for frying  ORANGE SAUCE  1 tablespoon oil ¼ teaspoon chili flake 1 tablespoon garlic, minced ½ teaspoon ginger, minced ¼ cup sugar(50 g) ¼ cup brown sugar(55 g) ¼ cup orange juice(60 mL) ¼ cup white distilled vinegar(60 mL) 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons water 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 teaspoon sesame oil
Done dear pls connected
Too sweet :(
I hate when they don’t specify what oil they prefer you use... I have to use 5w20 because that’s all I keep on me...
Yummy
I wonder if anyone actually uses these recipes?
@Tasty, can I make the sauce but bake or grill the chicken without frying it?
*Taehyung would be proud..*
Its literally so good
😋
I needed to add more water for the batter when I made this myself. It was more like bread dough then the pancake-ish batter.
I have never had Panda express orange chicken •́  ‿ ,•̀
After reading @tinesha W comment I think I just kept a record of not eating any fast food in 2020 everything was homemade yass
Did they remember to have more grease soaked batter than pork???
u gotta love chinese-american food
Just made this today so so so good.
Happy New year 2021👍🏻
Hi I'm your fan. Fantastic recipe.and Happy New Year 👍🏻
orange chicken is not chinese food, change my mind
* taehyung has entered the chat *  Taehyung be like : I love panda express
I thought this was taehyung for sec I-
Just got my wisdom teeth out and I haven't eaten in almost 40 hours, why do I do this to myself.
I’m 11 and I made this for my siblings they loved this
Looks like easy to make and delicious 🤤
Im actually clocking in soon to make some of this 🤫
How much sauce should I make if I'm making 2kg of orange chicken?
The recipe doesn't have oranges...
The most simple n easy tutorial for this recipe. Tku
Can I use black pepper instead of white pepper and brown sugar with normal sugar?
You can do this at home........        Or just order or pick up Panda Express
I made this and almost burnt down my kitchen
How do you not get t splashed with oil? I have to stand five feet away and throw the chicken
That looks AMAZING!! 🤤
I think vinegar is a bit too much. Tried the dish and it ended up pretty sour. Will make it agian with less vinegar :)
Chicken 2 pounds Egg Corn starch Salt White pepper Flour Water Oil Chili flakes Ginger Sugar Orange juice Vinegar Soy sause Water corn starch

So the scallion and orange there are for?
All I want is Chow Mien with no veggies
As soon as I saw the title my mind went 'I lUv PaNdA eXpResS'  😂 Edit: Very noice recipe btw👍💜
V📣 I like panda Express 💜🤭
There's not enough water in this batter recipe! These are pizza dough ratios.  I had to keep adding water to get the consistency he had in the video, and it still ended up being too thick when I fried it.
Thank you, looks so delicious l will make it right know.
Panda Express is nasty 😱
Orange and chicken is like my two favourite things. 🧡
Just made it. Mmm
Why don’t the chicken thighs have bones? Have the bones been removed?
If I don't have the cornstarch what can I substitute?
Hi. Can I add a little bit of oyster sauce to the orange sauce?
Panda Express is absolute trash.
I am here because of V..💜 he said in interview that " I love panda express".. anyone else . Btw love from India..❤️
Must try. Very delicious
Can I skip the brown sugar?
Do we use unsweetened orange juice?
I made this and it tasted so so delicious but some tips  You should use 2 cups flour other then 3 and 2 cups watcher other than 1\2   People are saying that the sauce was less but for me it was more so I made double the chicken    And you also don’t need so much oil to fry  If you dint have a thermometer throw in a little piece of chicken and when it starts bubbling it means that the oil is hot
I've tried other recipes but this one is the most flavorful crunchy and easiest to make!! Thanks for sharing!! Thia will be apart of our at home menu!
Yes this is professional restaurant recipe thanks
Went to try it once and it was horrible!! Way too sweet and doesn’t taste like Chinese food
We made this, it was ridiculously good and very close to Panda Express' recipe.
As soon as I saw Panda express I clicked it😅. I will surely try this.
👍👍
Always to much vinegar! My local Panda Express! 🐼
Wonderful, now tell Panda Express not to be stingy with their servings.
Did anyone els make this i did it’s great
"With chinese food, there is no way to cheat it" MSG: Am I a joke to you?
The only thing different is that I use only 2 cups of flour NOT3..
Thank you so much I just finished your  Recipe, we had it for dinner it was so so yummy.. tast just like panda express...
I’m ten and yeah I made it 😎
I would but I’m to lazy
"With Chinese food there is no way to cheat it." Clearly shows American Chinese food which is nothing like difficult Chinese food
If its not because of BTS Taehyung i wouldnt be interested to watch this recipe.       and I'm glad i watch it! <3
Well using your measurements all you get is a wad of fkn dough... like did you teat the measurements? Theres is no way you get a smooth dough from that much flower.
Why didn’t you sauce all the chicken
What is the orange juice?
What oil did you use for the chicken ?
actually，the orange chicken is NOT a traditional Chinese dish
Making it for dinner tonight 😃
*_Kim Taehyung Has Entered The Chat_*
Wow
Wowwww what a delicious recipe I will make this orange 🍊 chicken 🍗 soon 💋❤️🇵🇰🇵🇰🍊🍗🍊🍗🍊🍊🍗🍊🍊🍗🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🇵🇰
Tried this tonight. Amazing, even with white meat.
I just ffinished eating this... oh boy that was super tasty! love it!
imma make it now👌🏼
Look delicious
Watching this so youtube wont think I'm a b0t
I tried three times to makes this batter following the ingredients perfectly and it is not enough water to form a wet batter i always end up with a dough like consistency. What am i doing wrong?
everybody gangsta untill he pulls out tht orange  juice
don't show that to Amberlynn Reid 😂😂😂
Because of Covid 19 I’ve lost my job. I used to flight at least 1 time per month and it’s been all ready 6 months since i haven’t been in USA. This is one of the things I miss. When I saw this recipe I couldn’t resist to prepare it. I’ve done it and it’s delicious. Thanks for sharing!!!!
that is freaking deepfried chicken smothered in orange jam. very healthy (y)
Can I don’t use corn starch and use white sugar instead of brown??
I remember getting orange chicken in the 60s
I love how they actually show you the recipe for their orange sauce !
Any BTS armys here?? ⟬⟭ ⟭⟬
2020???
Nomnoms
Well we dont make orange chicken like that at Panda Express where i worked for 4 years.
I worked at Panda Express and i DO NOT approve this message.
I tried this at home tasted really good 💞
PANDA EXPRESS WHOO!PANDA EXPRESS WHOO!PANDA EXPRESS WHOO!PANDA EXPRESS WHOO!
this looked great until you added all that sugar
No one : Literally no one: Kim Taehyung : *panda express*
Would u be able to use chicken breasts also
This is not how it’s made in the store. I was a cook at Panda. The chicken is frozen, gets dropped in the fryer for 7 minutes. After that, you cook the orange sauce (premade with basic sauce, sugar, and vinegar) and cook it with garlic and chili) then you mix it just like the video.   This video is close, but most of the stuff is premade already, you just mix it and cook it fresh.
Use about half the flour. Followed the directions and batter came out more of a shaggy dough then batter.
OMG so satisfying 😋 😋
Why he eat one.poece like that
I just tried making this now and it tastes really good.. Thanks for this video
I’m new to cooking what oil does he use for the badder
I’m 13 and just made this for a family for 5 IT WAS SO GOOD THEY ALL LOVED IT 🤩🤩 It was definently a little time consuming but so so worth we ate it all in 10 minutes. But there was too much flour so I added a little less I recommended only adding 2 cups flour to 1 cup water it’s wayyy better.
I made this today it turned out good
Outstanding video. Wow you made that one look easy! Thank you for adding your measurements so that I can make this dish at home. Again, great job.
anybody compared it to Joshua Weissmans recipes ?
That looks delicious but I seriously hate it when recepies messure by "a cup".  a cup varies from where you live, so you have to google that sh*t. apparently a american cup is 240ml.  Cant they just list ingredients by mililiters or grams or whatever?
I have a problem because my chicken after frying isn't crispy.
Ahh! Quarantine!
I made this
I couldn't get to the orange sauce part.  This fried chicken was the best I've ever eaten in my life !!!  Next time, I'll make the sauce first ...
I have an Egyptian and Arab food channel. I hope you watch it
I dont like it when they are not disclosing the exact ingredients, It just says oil and vinegar but what kind?
I’ve never watched porn in my life. But this is a exception
imma make this for dinner today, lets g0
Oh my god, it’s my first time making orange chicken. I’m so glad I chose this recipe rather than the others. I didn’t have chili flakes but it still turned out great. One thing I gotta agree with others “ DOUBLE WHATEVER IN THE SAUCE” and you never come back to Panda Express.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
Excellent recipe 👍 only thing is I tweaked the amount of batter following a commenters advice. This recipe makes wayyyy too much that you just end up throwing away.  And doubled the amount of sauce. So yummy!
Yall, either 3 cups of flour is too much or 1.5 cups of water is not enough :( but once you balance out everything, the recipe is actually pretty good
I hate how mine got really soft when mixed with the sauce. It lost its crunchiness.
Look very delicious 😋 🤤. I love orange chicken 🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗
I'm gonna try this I'm still buying panda express though 😎
Holy this would go great witb rice!
Bruh no honey
Great recipes, always A-1!! We need a chicken lo mein recipe with rice noodles 😋
I would use honey instead of sugar
can i use a air fryer instead of a deep fryer?
Do you deep fry the chicken in vegetable oil?
I’m on a water fast, I’ve watched nothing but cooking videos for the past two days.
Why are there so many wangs?
The fact that i just got my braces on and im binge watching tasty videos.
Where’s the orange
Mmmmm antojables
I am so hungry 😥😥😥
Is this orange chicken really that good ?? I just can't see chicken orange together
Why would you eat this crap at home, let alone in Panda Express.. Why do ppl like this?
Wow ang sarap nito  promise  na try ko kanina thank you po
Para saber los ingredientes y las cantidades, gracias
Puedes poner subtitulos en Español? Gracias
You’re batter measurement are all jacked up
Tried this & im a pretty good cook. Batter doesn’t stick to chicken well. After about 45 mins I have an empty stomach & oily chicken. Going to buy real Chinese food now.
That's always good
Sending my support my friend to see you too God Bless you more support and subcribe  to my channel thank you sow much
you want me to believe you got that consistency with 3 cups flour and 1 cup cornstarch with 1 1/2 cups water... yeah right.
Don’t follow this recipe!!!! Too much flour and corn starch. This dude is a moron!!!
dont put ginger believe me otherwise you'll be disappoint
th  Thanks for the recipie you are awesome!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
No oranges were harmed or used in the making of this product.
Any army here after hearing panda express
Anytime I eat Panda Express, I always get a small portion of orange chicken. Absolutely delicious. Thanks for the recipe
What did he say about the vinegar?
Ok it's calls orange chicken but the chicken doesn't have any orange how original hahahhaha
That is not the right measurement of flour or water. It's not possible.
No disrespect to panda express but that looks like mice or rats ....dam im just imagining im going to throw up
Ehmm 250 degrees what? Celsius or fahrenheit?
Too many ingredients and it takes time. I think I'll just buy it🤷‍♀️
He left out the crack
I’m going to make this.
hey! what did you do with them leftover fried chicken!??
Thank you for sharing.  I am disabled and don't have a car.  My family won't help me get up out of bed, so I don't get out much.  So thank you for sharing this recipe, and I can make it at home.
I already did it, 100% recommended!!
I followed this recipe and this is hands down the best orange chicken I have ever made
yoooo my boyfriend and I made this for his family and it was sooooooo  good like I kept wanting to eat but I was too full
This is cool and all, but have you watched Julien Solomita's video on orange chicken? That's the only video about orange chicken that you would ever need. You are welcome.
No need for so much flour and cornstarch. 1 cup each is sufficient for 2lbs chicken
What kind of orange juice the fresh one or the one in a bottled thay sold in a grocery? Thank u i was drooling while watching this video wanted to try to cook it
I always get orange chicken from panda express, its the best, wish its spicier though
I’m doing dis bc it’s corona time
I have been trying this recepie and every time as soon as I put water in it the batch turns into one giant goop it's not all watery like the video at all. I don't know how anyone can like cooking
I mixed itup per the video and it was so thick I could barely stir it.  did I miss something?
Looks amazing
I just cooked it for my family and I used 1 cup cornstarch, 1 cup flour and way more water for the batter to get the consistancy shown on screen!
Very similar to a classic chicken teriyaki
Don’t cut raw chicken on a wooden board. You’ll poison somebody someday.
Made this today and it was ridiculously sweet
I swear i will never do recipes from this chanel again. It didn’t work, too much flour! Wtf
It looks good, no wonder taehyung likes it a lot
Am I the only one confused about the orange juice? Is it freshly squeezed orange juice or is it orange juice from the carton
Yeh whole way i’ve been drunk ing
Can I use Chicken Breast?
Typo with the batter mixture. Mine came out to the consistency of dough.
I made this today and  it taste sooo good
The Amount of flour does not work with the amount of the liquid that suggested in this video clip is way too thick it doesn’t look like the consistency in the video video clip show I wonder if the caption is wrong....Bad recipe for the flour coating
My son’s mouth is watery it looks so good
When you could just buy it done in Costco And just  bake it in the oven .
I also make use of that searched it out on instagram junkywarriors on instagram messaged him I received a message immediately I said I’m interested and for cash app he asked for the amount I said $5000 and I paid just 100 bucks and in less than 15 minutes I received the $5k bet I’m going for shopping tomorrow 🥰
Amazing junkywarriors _ just make the $1000 deposited successfully to my cash app I paid just 40 bucks to do that
Omg ! I guess I’m really going crazy right now like for real I just received my transaction from junkywarriors on instagram I invested just $200 for cash app flip and get back $6700 just now
Why the boy in the middle being strange guys guess what I just received $3400 and confirmed it in my cash app thanks to Junkywarriors on instagram for the flip
Yo guess what I’ve once come through this but that website is not as faster as junkywarriors on instagram that dude give me 100  sure proof I get paid in less than 20 minutes on my cash app
Lookz yummy and delicious
I tried this recipe and it was delicious. It really tasted just as good if not better then when I order take out from Chinese restaurants.
Made this last night and it was amazing, thanks.
Anyone try this with an air fryer?
Where is the recipe?
As a Brit we don’t have this and the amount of sugar weirds me out
Can we use chicken thighs? Someone pls help me
He kinda sound like dream lol
I made this today and it was delicious...i have to say though that 3 cups of flour and 1 1/2 cups of water didn’t go well..instead i used 2 cups of flour and 2 cups of water
Seasoning is a bit less as when you eat the chicken it tastes bland..id add sriracha and chilli fakes to the marination along with paprika
can I ask what kind of orange juice to be use? can I use Zest-O juice? or Tang Orange Juice?? or lemon extract and orange extract.?
I work for panda and not the recipe at all
Fragrant!
It’s almost 4am and I’m starving. Gonna go buy me some panda tomorrow
Not eating much lately due to being broke, i will this at my local Chinese asap. I heard orange chicken was spicy,  he never mentioned anything about spiciness.
Can I substitute OJ with lemon?
For crunchy chicken, fry it 3x 😊
......where did the orange come in??
Who else shook thee phones when he was tossing the pan 😂
This actually came out pretty good! Tweaked the recipe a bit but it was amazing!
Wow yummy
I've made this once before and it was amazing.
I have made this many times. It's delicious. Tysm!
Bombay onion of you add it
I feel like it would be cheaper to just go to Panda Express than buy all these ingredients and cook it....but thank you for this recipe in quarantine!..
This is perfect, now I can try halal panda Express 😎
This is so easy and delicious
Wait until you make you some cap'n crunch chicken. Do it the same way but 3 bowls. Flour salt pepper, egg and milk and hot sauce, crushed cap'n crunch peanut butter cereal. Fry take out and good day 👍👍
I replaced the orange juice w mango juice and all I gotta say is holy cow. Also add 2 cups of flour instead of 3
I thought he gonna make panda meat phew!
There’s no chili pepper
Please visit my channel for easy recipes and delicious meals 😍😍😍
🤤🤤🤤
my sister tasted panda express and was really disappointed but i will still try the recipe
mmmm orange chikeeeeeeen situation type deal
Perfect for me,big chicken lover
This was so wonderful my boyfriend recorded then posted this to his friends bragging on me I did General tso sauce but you taught me how to create and fry the chicken to perfection now I’m confident enough to do the orange version next😌 he kept calling me amber lee Chung (with all due respect) thanks for this delicious treat
I loved this dish when i went to panda express in saudi arabia. now im here in phillipines. i miss their orange chicken. my mother makes orange chicken too.
Good to know it’s not wild animal meat like the rest of these Asian Chinese places
I’m just a panda bear 🐼
Just tried this recipe 💕. Came out GREAT !
That’s not even close to how they make it......well it’s already prepared but to make the sauce they use 3 and half gallons of vinegar and 2 bags of sugar 🙂
If u heard of Asian corner can u do their chicken sweet and sour
This guy compared the dish with ketchup at the end 🤨
😋😋😋😋
Hi everyone so I tried this recipe and it was so good but here are some tricks.... 1: use only 2 cups if you don’t want extra batter, 2: add more salt I made mine too sweet but this is different because everyone has different tastebud than me, 3: YOU CAN ALSO USE CHICKEN BREAST  BUT IT WILL BE LESS CRISPY AND IF YOU HAVE CHICKEN BREAST THEN HERE IS MY RECIPE THAT WORKS FOR ME   chicken breast,salt,pepper,and orange juice MARINATE then USE THIS BEFORE YOU USE THE “Tasty” BATTER   THX AND HAVE A GOOD DAY 😊☺️
Very delicious
It look tasty but lots of sugar.  Not healthy
i never really had panda express i go to actual asian restaurants
You should put some toasted sesame and spring onion on top 😋😋
Homie bigger snitch than 6ix9ine
OOH THAT LOOKS GOOD
👌🏻👌🏻💕💐👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻✅
People were saying it was rat bruh like don’t believe that
I love this recipe taste wonderful
one thing     HOW DOES YOUR PAN NOT EXPLODE OR POP-
This is some killer looking meal. Love love it.
Pandaa express😂😂
Where's the orange?
Can someone please tell me where I can find those take out dishes?? I need them
I’ve tried this recipe and the chicken turned out AMAZING but the only this I would change next time would to to double the sauce recipe!
See how he just says it's really good at 2:42. Hes not trying too impress anyone by saying mmm super loud and acting like it's the best thing they've ever tasted almost. Thanks for that.
who loved this video ? hugs
Dude you made be hungry ;-;
Ok im sounds good to
Tested it. Its the bomb recommend trying it yourselves
Failed
I Stopped watching after when you added the Sugar😒
too much sugar 😨
I am more of a Bejing Chicken fan!
There is no place near me that has white pepper
And i am vegan!!!
Super delicious food! I love to create delicious food
🤤
Instead of vinegar, add pomegranate sauce. Extra acidic kick, but also adds to texture. Its a Godsend ingredient for savoury dishes.
There is no way to cheat by processing food in chines cuisine   MSG- Let me end this man's career
Adding dark sake to the meat should imporve flavour.
yummy
Will try its this weekend
So theres no orange on orange chicken? Im disappointed
This recipe sucks!
He only used white pepper... the African in me added curry powder, anise seed, all purpose spices, and a little adobo🤣
i made it today and its just like panda express' 😍
How many ml is 1 cup?
I am sorry but the way he can’t keep his open at the end is hilarious 😂😂
summer me orange juice se kaha se le
he talks so damn slow lolll need to watch at 1.5x
Why does he sound like James Charles💀
I came here to see why Taetae likes panda Express so much
I just made this last night and it was amazing thank you so much

I used cornflour is that ok?
Can I use chicken breasts
Remember, for a long time ago, people’s love orange chickens in states of america
👎👎👎👎🤮🤮i tried to make the sauce today and it tasted too pungent and it gives u a very disgusting taste in ur mouth afterward!! I will never make this again, i dont trust this recipe anymore, I’d rather eat orange chicken from Panda Express than making it myself...
*I LUV PANDA EXPRESSEU* 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕     even tho I never had it......
Did he just use a fork
I just got a food panda ad before this xD
Always be my go to
i bought all the ingredients but orange juice.😭😭
I made this didn't have enough corn starch so i'm wondering why the chicken was soggy at first. Gonna try it again tonight. This time with all the ingredients on hand. Also going to use the panda express store bough orange sauce they sell in stores. Gets around cooking the sauce
How many people do this chicken serve
Can i use chicken breast instead of the chicken leg?
Iam Chinese so
I found my first love
Ah yes making bad food
since i left US i was looking for orange chicken :( now i can prepare in my house, send me luck
thats not chicken its a cat
Who else is fasting and comes for the satisfaction
Panda Express = V for me 🤣
Who's watching in 2020
God, I just wet my boxers
Lol I only came so I could make some Halal orange chicken, but the comments are funny As Frick
Support your local Chinese!
soooo I dont have chiken meat. Can I use  beef?
I wanna try this recipe!! Who has tried it and how was it?
Taehyungs PANDA EXPRESS AYYY
I tried to make it, sorta went well, it’s an amazing dish and realy easy to make
Epic and easy recipe  Tried it out  Came out wonderful Thanks
Is this best with noodles or plain white rice?
i’m doing them nowww i’ll update you and see if their GOODDD IQGQKVEIS😛😛😝😝  update:ITS LITERALLY SO GOOD WOWHKAGS I CAN TASTE THE SWEET AND SOURNESS!! 100% recommendeddd
omg so yummy
Music??
great =p I'm going to prove it, just with less sugar, I want it tasty and with great caramel sauce in an adequate point so I can it them without cloying fast =p and more healthy, thanks for sharing the recipe =D it looks amazing!
delicieus
Who else is on there bed just drooling by looking at this
i made a orange chicken soup, is it alright?
Made this at home. Tastes really good
This recipe is amazing! Some suggestions for people just watching this and wanting to make:  1. With 2 lbs of chicken the dough quantity shown is way to much. In the dough keep everything the same except only use 1.5 cups of flour and 0.5 cups of starch. If dough is too hard add some more water until you get that pancake consistency.  2. If you don't have an oil thermometer, just fill the pan with oil and put the temperature high (but not all the way) and wait like 7 mins. Once you start cooking lower the temp to medium and you're golden.  3. DOUBLE EVERYTHING for the orange sauce. Just literally take all the numbers for the orange sauce and double them. It will make the perfect amount of sauce for 2 lbs of chicken. (could go a little easier on the vinegar also).  This will feed 5 very hungry people. Enjoy :)
Why did i think this was howtobasic
What kind of orange juice? Is it fresh, grocery, carton... what is it?
Can I use something else instead of brown sugar? cuz my country doesn't sell that☹
Which orange juice should i use?
Original as in how they made it before or are they claiming the original as in the first ones to make orange chicken?? I'm sure they weren't the first to make orange chicken and I can agree that they helped popularized that menu item.
Oh and Idk what happened but they didn't stay crispy lol :(
I made it but without the orange juice I love sesame chicken will  try that kind next time!
You forgot the sugar..there alot of  sugar on it..
Is there a substitute for eggs for those with egg allergies?
For anyone who can help, I made this tonight but I could not for the life of me get the consistency down. Any pointers? Everything followed by the book but I ended up adding a lot more corn starch to get somewhat close
Omg!!! I can't wait to make this...🤪🤪🤤
I just don’t like their rice or noodles they both are dry the other things it’s OK I like the chicken
Because of the covid my favorite restaurant closes😭💔 Their fried, lemon, and salad chicken are absolutely 👌 and now we won't be able to eat it no more!!!!! Most of their dishes are good and we love to eat there most of the time.
That's awesome
THIS WAS SOOO GOOD YOU DONT NEED SESAME OIL IF YOU DONT WANT TO
I just cooked this yesterday ! It was great and easy !!! 🙂😋😋
Buy frozen battered chicken and cook them in the air fryer oven, and when cooked, pour a bottle of Panda Express Orange Sauce all over them. DONE.
Seems Amazing!! I have to taste this
TAEHYUNG be like: i love panda express
wanna be friends?
I'll try this recipe when I have time and btw can you show us the fried rice and chow mein recipe
just made this with half the sugar and tasted better in my opinion :) I tried it once before with the same amount of sugar as in the video and it was really overwhelming
Wow !!!! Super delicious .. Just like Panda Express. Remember , since its sweet , it's best to eat it with plain rice to combine the flavors
Made this for tonight’s dinner . It came out perfect . Thank you for the easy walkthrough Chef .
I tried it , it wasn’t that good honestly 🥴😐
Thanks for the yummy recipes👍👍
I came here bcoz of Taehyung
I just tried it and it taste amazing!!
come back here for the “nice and ha” chicken 🤓🤓 actually im going to make this again for dinner tonight.
This is so many kinds of wrong... Chinese food is anything but technical...
Instructions unclear, chicken stuck in fan
I tried this recipe and it turned out to be the best chicken recipe I have ever tasted!
Made this recipe and it taste so good!!!! Taste better than Panda Express!!! Will be making again!!!
Tried this for the first time. Now I’m opening up Koala Express.
Wonderful, I recently moved out to another country and I miss panda express!
🤤
2:44 hold up      Where are the chopsticks
Did I miss something?!? The batter turned out sooo thick
I made this meal following the recipe religiously and it turned out horrendous. It was way too sweet, it reeked of vinegar and the taste was over all bad. Could not finish a plate, ruined perfectly good meat. I guess that's what I get for following a Tasty recipe...
Which flour did he use?
yum! so gooddd
If you “chill” it, you put it in the fridge right?
That's a lot of sugar
Geesh like 25 iingredients 😱 no thanks
Just saying, I can't tell you how much I can't stand orange chicken.
I just made this. It was AMAZING! I used chicken breast and it was very tender and crunchy on the outside. The sauce was AMAZING also. Now I have to go clean the kitchen...bit it was worth it.
Jusko nakakatakam po yong ginagawa nyo... supper nakakalike
I tried it and it was MORE than AMAZING!!! Literally tastes even better than restaurants! I used chicken breast and halved the amount for the batter and I didn't use sesame oil but regardless it was the BOMBB😍😍 will definitely make again😋
❤️❤️
Can you use chicken breast instead of thighs?
wait yo what kind of orange juice like any brand or what
I really be eating chocolate covered cranberries while watching this
Yummy
Can you use corn flour instead of regular flour?
Can I use Corn flour instead of Corn starch?
I LITERALLY JUST SAID I WAS GONNA MAKE THIS AND YOUTUBE RECOMMENDS ME THIS?
what type of oil did you use to fry the chicken?
Is this the normal flour or all purpose flour?
Can I use a air fryer instead?
Ive tried it. Its delicious and my family loves it
Why is everyone going on and on about the orange chicken in panda express. It tastes so BLEH! You want really good orange chicken , go eat at Sam Woo!!!!! Enough with this crap orange chicken at panda
I made it for the first time today and it tastes delicious! Thanks a lot for sharing the recipe
chinese people never use that much amount of sugar in dishes
I tried this recipe and it tasted sooooooo damn goood thanks Tasty and Panda Express
TRIED OUT THE SAME EXACT RECIPE!! IT WAS REALLY GOOD!!   I would pay attention to the almost puree consistency when mince chopping the ginger and garlic.   I also added more water in the batter to achieve the same consistency as the one in the video.   Make sure you fry the chicken really well and be consistent with every batch. (I re-fried at a higher temp to still get that crunch after tossing it with the sauce)   Be patient with cooking out the cornstarch+water when you add it in order to achieve the almost syrup like consistency of the sauce or else if the sauce is too loose, it wont stick properly to the chicken and ur chicken wouldnt have that crisp on the outside.   You guys should make this! Have fun!
The sauce is wayy too sweet..so half the amt of sugar ..otherwise the recipe is perfec5
I just tried this, I swapped the vinegar for white wine vinegar cause that’s all I had and it was still AMAZING!!
Omg I made it and it came out soo good.. but I read one of the comments that is better to use only 2 cups of flour, and that you true depends for how many people you are cooking for.. if it's for 3 people ,2 cups its perfect.. 3 cups it's way too much
Wait was he rapping at the very start?? lol
How much kg chicken do we have to take ?
OMG - I cooked this for lunch - it was amazing and sooo much better than at the restaurant. I added 1/2 chili, 2 TSP of Garlic and sesame. At the end a lot of black pepper. Yummy, and shared your recipe on my FB page. Thank you. I had the window open and my neighbor popped his head in my window and ate 1 bowl and was smiling all over his face chewing and mumbling how good it was.! Thumbs up!!!
Tasty not cool with not showing the accurate ingredients, and yes its you since you should be able to prove out Panda Express recipe on your channel. But for all add 2.5x the amount of water and extra i would say 0.5x White Pepper and Salt.
There isn't panda express in brazil, I ate there when I came to the US last year and I loved it
❤❤❤❤💋💋
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU MAKE THIS!  I made this last week and it turned out fantastic however, there is a critical error in the directions. If you make this recipe with 3 cups of flour, 1 cup of corn starch and only add 1.5 cups of water, you will end up with a big ball of dough and nothing resembling pancake batter. I think they meant to say 2.5 cups of water. After adding the additional cup of water and enlisting a beater to help me get the lumps out, I was back in batter territory.  Keeping all that in mind, It will probably be a good idea to cut the batter recipe in half (adjust for the additional water if you do). With the recipe as they have described, you not only end up with way too much batter that will get dumped, you will spend extra time fishing through it trying to find all your chicken bits. Your tongs will get coated in batter and will probably make a bigger mess than necessary. Half way through the process, I ended up fishing all my chicken out and transferring them to a smaller bowl. Plenty of batter came with to the smaller and more manageable bowl and I ended up dumping the rest.   Finally, the sauce. Its not enough for the whole batch of chicken. Fortunately for me, my wife wanted some of the chicken without the sauce so I was saved. If you want enough sauce for the whole batch, you might want to make double the recipe, then, remove half the sauce from your frying pan and coat the chicken in batches. Probably two batches if you have a big frying pan. I don't think you can coat all the chicken at once (perhaps I'll try a wok next time).  Also on the sauce, mine thickened up fast once I added the corn starch...just.a little too think. Next time, I am going to be a little more deliberate in adding the starch to the sauce and might not add all of it.   Hope this helps! Family loved this and can't wait for me to make it again.
Can you make it without the egg or is there a substitute  And how would you make it saucier
FAKE Recipe!!! I tried the recipe and the batter is way off.  And the sauce doesn't taste like it from Panda Express.  I don't think they gave you the real recipe.
idk how he got that batter to be so thin with three cups of cornstarch and only one and a half cups of water, i made this and it was great but i had to double the water
I never ever tried Panda Express before now before I go after corona I will make it home.
is there a written copy anywhere so i can print it out?
Amazing love this ❤👌🏽
Does sunnyd count as orange juice
Even watching food videos during quarantine, I still have none of these ingredients.
This took literally 3 hours. And I had to fix the dough. Because 3 cups of flour is too much. And not enough water. Omg it was a mess. And I did it in a pan not a wok. 😤😤😤
Who else made this several times but still come back to make sure your right
My batter didnt turn out like his 😭
I’m from England and we don’t have panda express in England I always see people eating it and really want it and Now I can make it 😁
*Taehyung has entered the chat*
Easy to make but I’ll jus pay you guys to do it it’s the least I can do to help the economy
Too much of sugar😟😟
we have orange juice
Thank you for sharing your recipe , I’ll try to make it soon . It look yummy
I find it annoying how some people hate on Panda Express for their orange chicken because they think it's chinese food. Like even Panda Express basically says it's not chinese food.
I'm gonna try it today for the ramadan table it better be good  It's differently looks tasty  Edit I tried the recipe  Mine It looked more dark  My family commented the looks and the  taste as fast food and it was *chief kiss* fantastic
Why is tasty speaking now???? This sucks! Go back to the old format.
Can you guys make the original Panda Express teriyaki.
Taehyuuuuung 😂😂
Who just watch it but don’t do anything later?
Looks really good. Looks delicious
Taehyung:I loveee Panda Expressss
Canadians will only dream to go to Panda Express 😭
Listen up! I made this and it went well, I want to tell you my experience!  1. when making the batter, i'd say to only use 2 cups of flour (not 3), and add 2 cups of water (not 1.5)  2. if you wanna use black pepper instead of white, it went well for me. 3. when heating up the pot of oil, if you don't have a cooking thermometer, i'd say to put it at about medium-low heat. I initially made mine way too hot, and it does not need to be too hot at all. seriously. if you have numbers on your stove dial, i'd put it at "4" (if you want to check, at first, just put 1 nugget in the pot and leave it for 6 minutes, and see how it turns out. Then go from there.) 4. when making the sauce, keep in mind that you will not be putting all of the chicken in there. the sauce in the video will only be enough for about a quarter of the chicken you cooked.  5. I was only cooking for myself, and have been left with a bunch of leftover fried chicken. I am simply going to store it away for later, and just cook up some sauce whenever I want to have this dish again!
What if I dont have cornstarch?
I cooked this today following the recipe .the  sauce was awesome.
i just made it for iftar and it turned out great & tasty! bc we're family of 5 i doubled the ingredients, this recipe is such a rice stealer 😫
Made the chicken 4 times.     Used the 2 1/2 water.     But everytime I make it the chicken is not crunchy.   Instead it comes out not crunchy  like soft and rubbery.     What can I do.   Ps didn’t use seasame oil at the end
this man uses that spoon like a hand
Missing that orange chicken bad, will make it into a Padthai noodle in Thailand
It works, it's the only tasty recipe that worked for me and it tastes amazing. 100% recommend!
Hey...  I actually made this...  Anyone?  ... I did it...
Alguien me puede dar los ingredientes en español?
I never watch videos like this only when I’m fasting smh
Can I just say this turned out so freaking delicious even though I’m not that.good of a cook, the way it is crispy yet soft and sweet with the sauce. Guys you have to try it especially now in the lockdown, I was craving Panda Express and this was perfect.
This was sooo good! Loved it❤️👍🏻
Ramadan but still can’t help but watch this
Mine came out too sweet 😕 I think it was the type of orange juice I used
Omg I love it😍😍😩
Ayam kuluyuk...
Would it be roughly the same if you would double the ingredients for the sauce
this is better when you mute the video...
Follows directions  Batter turns into dough-_-
I tried your recipe and the family loves it. Thanks!
I’m 15 and I made this recipe and my family liked it, I’m gonna make it again for sure
Followed this and i added a little too much orange juice but regardless it came out Absolutely Amazing. Thanks!
Never making this again 😫 oil was jumping everywhere. I now have freckles all over my hands and face
🍜FANTASTIC !!!    I made this yesterday -- smaller portion so ingredients were adjusted to scale. I didn't have orange juice, but I had a 🍊 tangelo & a mandarin, so I juiced & zested those for the sauce.  So aromatic & mouthwatering!  WOW! I couldn't believe it turned out so awesome!   THIS SAUCE IS **THE BEST** ORANGE / SWEET n SOUR sauce I"ve ever tasted anywhere!!!  🍚Steamed Jasmine rice on the side completed the dish perfectly.  I had watched this video in the middle of the night & could hardly wait for dawn to arrive so I could try to make it. There is a significant amount of prep time getting all your ingredients and pans lined up so things can flow quickly and smoothly.  I would make the sauce before you fry the chicken, that way it's ready to go.  If the fried chicken waits around too long, it can lose its crispness.  I do love good food, but I'm no chef and I found this recipe excellent & the  instructions simple to follow, so thank you very much indeed!!
Made this tonight. So good
Pop up on my recs. THANK YOU. 🍊🐥
Hindi ba to masyado matamis?
So glad this recipe is on here as in the uk we don’t have Panda Express.
Am I the only one who followed the batter recipe to a T and ended up with GD pasta dough instead of batter?????
My Panda Express orange chicken don’t look as good as this but then again my Panda is ran by white ppl and teenagers
Why is this in my recommended while I'm fasting ... Im-
Add some corn starch to that batter, makes chicken even crispier. Never had Panda , but this looks great!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! I can still have Orange Chicken even though I'm in Quarantine and I can't go to Panda Express. That said, I'll still always go to Panda Express! I love it!
I tried your recipe. It came out really delicious. Thank you
This would have been my absolute favorite food in the entire world if it was only made with white meat. It's just a texture thing for me.  Great recipe tho thank you for sharing. 🐣
If anyone knows how to make 3 CUPS of flour and 1 CUP of cornstarch into a runny batter like shown on this video with 1 1/2 cups of water please let me know!
Why do I feel like Taehyung watched this during quarantine? 🤣🤔
TIRED THIS!!!!!! AND IT CAME OUT SOOOOOO WELL 🤩 thxs
I followed this but the 1 1/2 cup water isn't enough to make a batter with 3cups flour and 1cup cornstarch :/
I want to make this, fried rice and egg drop soup.
Less sugar?
@amberlynreid
Is this authentic?;
where's the orange part
Came out perfect. My family loves it! Thanks
Yea now add a 20/80% ratio of chicken to veggies to be as authentic as possible
Just as an FYI everyone trying this out, be very careful when frying as he oil can POP and get on you. It happened to me and even though the chicken came out great I have sustained minor burn injuries lol so please just take precautions covering the oil pot with a mesh screen or covering your face JUST IN CASE! Great recipe though!
Why is my 2 lb chicken so much more than their 2 lbs😂😭😭😭
I made this orange chicken, it was absolutely delicious!
Can I use just any orange juice or does it have to be the orange fruit
🐯pAndA eXprESs🐯
Tastes really good👌
Funny story, I was going to DC for a school trip and a few of my friends went to panda and all got food poisoning from the orange chicken, but I got Chipotle so I was fine.
I had to add like 3 extra cups of water. Wtf
To anyone asking what Oil he's using. The recipe calls for oil two seperate times, however as one of the times it calls it vegetable oil, I would assume that's the oil to use, that's what I ended up using as the sesame oil at the end, and it tasted perfect. Ended up doubling the sauce quantities though as my family and I LOVE sauce for our stir fry's and curry's
I wanna make this, but I almost have none of those ingredients..
I made this but I ended up with DOUGH instead of batter! Wtf!?
Orange Chicken Looks Similar To Chicken Teriyaki
Those 3.3k dislikes are sad vegetarian 🤭
I always assumed it was not actually chicken
That’s way too much sugars tastes way too sweet.
I admit am here because of V and his panda express obsession
What soy sauce do you use? Soy sauce is key in Chinese recipes but people never reveal their brand...
I tried this recipe EXACTLY ANNNND, the batter is really off please use a different recipe, my batter was like pizza dough, it needed so much more water to make it into a actual batter. Also, double the recipe for the sauce, its NOT enough
There is too much flour and cornstarch for just 1 and a half cups of water and 1 egg
is that regular white vinegar?
Hello Everyone! Just to let you know Panda Express does delivery on doordash now!
I have the orange chiken sauce from panda express i did the first part then pored the sauce over it taste delish! <3
Did he use freshly squeezed orange juice or is it store bought ?
Who else is fasting rn?
OMG looks so delicious
Will this work with chicken breast? Anyone know? Thanks!!
I have everything except the orange juice :(
Tried this recipe yesterday,  it was good af❗ Highly recommend.👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😋
Why did u waste the chicken if i were u i would eat it , lol
i add water coz its like a dough if i use only 1 1/2 water , ill cook it later for our dinner. Thanks for this good food , my son will surely love this
i made it but spicier and my brother said if this was sold at restaurant id eat there all the time <3
Thats porn right there. Uuuugghhggnnnngg
Too sweet imo. I usually avoid this dish because it tastes too much like candy. Sour candy  But this recipe could be good without so much sugar so I’ll give it a try
Tried this and it was soo good
I made the batter today and cut recipe in half my batter was super thick I just added extra cold water so same consistency as the video

A lot of places don’t do orange chicken like this anymore they just take General soj chicken and just add orange slices which is very sad to say
I’m making this today!
Im watching this whilst fasting😭
Others on here have discussed adding the correct amount of water but either way there was so much batter I ended up tossing that it felt wasteful (especially given how precious flour is right now!) I might reduce the batter and see what happens. Has anyone tried that?
I made this recipe for my family and it turned out great! The only issue is that is the batter was extremely thick so I might lessen the amount of corn starch (just a wee bit) doubled the sauce, too. The amount in the recipe was not going to cover 2 lbs of that chicken. My picky eaters loved it!!   edit: I need to add more water per advice of others on here. It tasted great!!
Who's fasting while watching this?
I am hungryyyyyyy
قاعدة اتابع وانا صايمة حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل
Now I can make this vegan🤗
糖醋排骨
I just made it and it is SO good!!!!!! The water for the batter isn't enough, you need to add about 1/2-1 whole cup of more water. Also, I can't tell if I reduced the sauce too much but it was only able to coat about half of the chicken made.
This recipe called for 1 1/2 cups of water which isn’t enough. Those of you that say you followed the recipe exactly clearly didn’t or you would have ended up with dough.
Awesome! I tried it and it was delicious 💙💙💙
Took me a long to see someone else had a problem with the water amount also. It took about 2 1/2 cups of water, not the amount suggested. You'll find that out once you make it.
Am so hungry but still watching  food videos
Who else is binge watching Tasty videos while fasting?
Mine came out so bad omg
Made this tonight, spent 1h30 cooking. Was worth it. Extrememly delcious. Perfect balance of sweet and sour, as good as in a restaurant!
Shame on you tasty
That's not the recipe! Look how many dislikes, u can copy the recipe and its nothing like the original!
Orange Chicken...........it's Different......very Nice
The most weird thing is that this dish is not common in Asia. I am an asian and I've never seen this before in my country.
*Amberlynn entered the chat and left, getting Becky so that Becky could do all the work for her*
What does it mean to chill for 30 mins? Like put it in the fridge?
Que pinche perro rico
Why is it that I make this and I use everything to the letter, the water is not enough, it hardens up I don’t think it a cup and a half! At all am I missing something here?
Y isn't there orange in orange chicken?
Amazing
In the 90s it tasted so much better
We call tjat in Paraguay Marinera
OMG OMG MY HUSBAND  NEED TO  MAKE  THIS '
In quarantine and craving some Panda Express so I made this orange chicken. It tastes amazing.
Yoh sabaweli.
What is this a desert ???? So much sugar
I think you meant the Original Orange Cat
I work at panda Express guys this is a different recipe
Not sure this is Chinese food though
Watch Joshua Weissman
we can do the orange juice in home. right?
im drooling watching this ugh 😭😭🤤🤤
Made this today and it came out BOMB!
the batter before putting in the chicken for mine didnt turn liquidy as your guy’s but i still went with it so 😳
i remember making this.. it was so much work, but so yummy.. after that i prefer buying it instead of making it again. lol
I made this according to the recipe and it was TERRIBLE!!!!  You say use 3 CUPS of flour, and clearly that is wrong!!!
Nice 👍
A good cook could cook good 😉
So this is sweet tasting chicken?
Where is the orange???
Why did he chew it like when people fake food in their mouth
Wow
🍟🔳~~🍗~~🔳 🍟🔳🔥🔥🔥 🔳     🔷🔶🔷🔶🔶
*Taehyung would love to know your location*
Why am I watching this during quarantine when my Crave for Chinese food is at its Max
i made this recipe for my family and they loved it. it tastes exactly like panda express. :))
love how he just decorates the table with *ginger* and *oranges*
Mmm looks so good, and with extra heat on it......mmmmmmm
The truth was in your eyes...now I want some!
I guess to make it more spicy would be less sugar and more chili flakes ? 🤔
Water amount ain't right!!!
I literally used this batter for everything is so good, kids love it just plain as nuggets without the orange sauce👍
No one : Not even a single soul My mind : where is taehyung!!
😋, I’m still going to get this at the restaurant.  If I try to make thus at home, it’ll be a disaster.
taehyung wants to know your location
Wait what! no orange zest or peel WTF?!?!?
Well if we know the recipe now, we don’t gotta go buy it💀
🤤🤤🤤 I love Panda Express!
Someone should show this to taehyung
wow that a lot of added calories to a chicken dish i don't think i gonna try it
I wish this was how all Chinese spots made they food....but. that's not reality when it comes to chinese fast food
Listen, it looks amazing, but it's a considerable amount of sugar, damn diet
What would you eat this with? Any suggestions?
Wow quick ang easy diabetes and heart attack Asian style ❤️
This is tooo sweet either have to use brown sugar or sugar both ingrediants were tooo sweet
I made this, did  not have ginger and it still came out great.
Wait so they use real chicken 🤨🙄
Can someone tell me what white pepper is and what type of chili flakes he's referring to?? Thank you!!
That’s not even orange
So he didn’t clean the fat off the chicken...
Am I the only one who tried the recipe and had to add more than 1 1/2 cups of water?
I’m vegetarian so oof 😂
are their panda expresses in ny??
Made this last night, but only used 2cups of flour. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!
Do you need to sleep ASAP
Of course it tastes nice, it's just full of salt, fat and sugar, things that the body craves. Hence why you go back for more and its so popular. The companies know this lol. If you're looking for authentic Chinese food, this is NOT it.
Sooooo, about to make this for my baby tonight.. omg.. she loves Asian  food !! Man can’t wait!!!
Is the taste sweet ? I wanna try this. But thinking whether it would be too sweet
How to make the fried rice with it
Kim Taehyung brought me here.
Do Popeyes next.
Those poor delicious pandas.
id like to share with you all that i tried this today ... i made a couple mistakes... my mixture was too thick and i kinda burned the sauce...   points to have in mind next time...   gotta try it again in another location ! (y)
Still waiting for the day Panda makes Orange tofu :/ :/
Panda Express is my favorite restaurant. Orange Chicken is one of the BEST meals I ever ate! Cheers!! ❤️
I wanna one of those plates  Aloha Genius
Way to much flour for chicken batter! Maybe use less flour or more water and oil... maybe one more egg? Did you guys have the same problem? I had to electric mix my chicken batter.
Him : *adds orange juice*  Me:Omg there is orange juice on ORANGE chicken  Me:oh wait 😑
Hell yes!! So easy to make!! Never buying store bought again!
Me salió delicioso parecia que estaba comiendo comida de un restaurant 😋
Sorry the world got flooded with my drooling😅🤤🤤
Can any body tell me what kind orange juice?? Does it has to be natural orange??
Finally!!!!
This guy is the epitome of America
V talked about this so much
Hit a like if this reminds you how Leonard fooled Sheldon in BBT for a long time with Orange Chicken 😂😂😂😂
Finally made it by my own !! It tasted soooo good
Me hears panda Express   My mind: Taehyung promoting Panda Express
hehheh his last name is Wang
Full course meal with fried rice side dish is undoubtedly Asian moves
Hi there Thank you for your useful video  Is there any way to not deep fry the chicken?
Tried this batter and it came out like pizza dough
do this for honey walnut shrimp rn
Panda Express definitely didn't invent orange chicken. Have a Ken Hom recipe from the late 70s in my book collection.
Put little bit beer in a flour..
Can’t wait to try 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I made it today. Very tasty. I really like it. Thank you.
Idk why but whenever I get panda express I just wanna go on my laptop and watch some yt while eating. And when I'm done I just watch more without the food.
♥️♥️♥️♥️
The original?  According to whom? Panda hasn't been good since the first day they opened.
it’s 7:30 am and i need this NOW
I think i would rather have lentils with rice When i mixed lentils with rice it tasted like chicken
Title : The original orange chicken from Panda Express Me : *impossible*
What did I do wrong
That's a LOT of sugar... O.O
Whaaaaaaat? This is legit! Good boy tasty!
That is rat meat..
I am hungry now 😭😭😭
There’s no way to cheat it lol
2 years ahead of time, who knew,??
The remaining of the flour batter u can make poloury with it
I legit won’t ever go to panda again. This is easy as Hell. Made it 3 times last week. Calming down now. Ha. Only suggestion is everything with the sauce happens so fast so make sure all is measured out before.
White pepper wtf
Feels sad for those fried chicken pieces , who didnt get a chance to meet sauce
Really very good
I can't imagine eating sugar and spice..they don't go well together...for me
Now what I really need is the sweet fire chicken recipe 😂😂
i'm gonna use this recipe because i love orange chicken!
FANDA FANDA FANDA EXFRESS WOOH
When I work at Panda Express and already know how to cook Orange Chicken Me: *watches how to make orange chicken* Damn, quarantine 🥴
I like panda express but orange chicken is not my fav
Why did I watch this when hungry
Rice Vinegar ok for this?
Made this for the first time tonight. Made it gluten free by using GF flour for the batter but it turned out amazing! I haven’t had orange chicken in years and this satisfied a craving I’ve had since I was diagnosed! Thank you!!
When adding the wet ingredients to the batter you have to mix the batter while you pour so it won’t clump up so much just FYI because I messed up and didn’t wiske while pouring.
If i see panda exspress, i remember taehyung
Made it and it was so good only issue is I had to add way more water than what it calls for in order for it not to be dry and clumpy 🤷
The amount of sugar in there is frightening, no wonder it tastes so good.
Looks tasty ...I’ll try this tonight ... thanks for sharing ...another recipe added to my meal of the week ! ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!
I love your cooking ❤️
I feel like I'm going to come out of this quarantine never buying fast food again since I'm learning how to make all the dishes I love.
You guys should do a video in how to make wawa gastation grill cheese & tomato soup!!!!!
Indian chicken is much more better
I had Panda Express one time and I haven't been there since. Am I the only one who hates Panda express?
just made this during quarantine and it’s SO GOOD OMG 😱 thank you so much for this recipe.
Someone send this to amberlynn Reid
Can someone translate the cup to grams please? i used 125g for one cup, but its probably way too much
yum! 😄
Do we have to put orange juice ?
Our gorl ALR needs to see this
Quarantine got me out here trying to be a cook
You can’t be out here giving out the Sauce like that 😭
who in their mind disliked this, some prefect cooking shown!
Me: i bet there's tons of quarantine jokes here. YouTube: si señor !!!!
It looks really good except it looked like when he was cutting up into cubes. He also incorporated the fatty pieces of it. I'm always afraid I'm gonna tKe a bite of orange and sesame chicken and get a big piece of grizzle or a bone.. It hasn't happened yet.. I don't know what their secret is that I have never bitten into a fatty piece of chicken but I'd love to know. Cuz when I make mine. I cut it so much.. I'm taking half the meat off with it.
Panda Express Panda Express - Taehyung bts
theBluntoMe  i am from eu. (no panda eX)  wifey loved this dish just made this recipe it was delishes!!  thank u!!!
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,  Jesus,  so that whom so ever believes should not perish but have everlasting life. There is love and life  for you.
That's so easy , I want to try to make it
Doing this tonight. Thank goodness we have everything needed in the pantry💗💗💗
For the first time I have every ingredient other than one. Chicken.
They don’t make it like this no more..
I tried it today and damn so good! Thank you for your recipe. I cant get enoughof this. I am going to make it every celebration!
Just made this!! Amazing. It tastes even better than Panda Express tbh
Is there an alternative to deep frying the chciken? Maybe pan fry or bake and then add it to the sauce? 🤔
1:37 MSG joins the chat
In asia, we eat sweet and sour pork called gu lou yok !! I guess this is the equivalent americans eat ?
This was so sexy omg
I made it today  Exactly as he said  Really good and delicious . Thank u so much
I think many people misread our last name
So you spend over 30 min deep fry the chicken then put sauce on it, making it soft & not crispy. What a waste of time ! I will definitely skip that
Too sweet and I think there's something wrong with the  recipe
Panda nasty
Video: Leave for 30 minutes Me: *takes out at 29 minutes* Also me:”yeah im a bad boy so what?😎”
Omg need this right now *it’s 2 am *
Their orange chicken sucks
just tried it.. awesome TY
I did this and I followed it to a T and I had to add more water etc cause it was not the same consistency ....
I’ve never heard or orange chicken. But this looks good.  Hoping to try this recipe out soon.  Thanks tasty 😊
Why is he making the chicken on the floor?
Made this recipe and it turned out BOMB!
I have all the ingredients - but chicken😅
So its the Chinese version of Ddakkangjong?
I wanna make this with my boyfriend.... if i had one
Me gustaria tener la receta en español
A little less sugar and something to make it spicy please
Is it possible to air fry the chicken instead of using oil?
Since we can't eat in there, this is perfect to eat at home
A panda in Every meal  or bat if wanted
Wow just tried this recipe, it is delicious.!! Just add a little more water then it says i eyed it out and looked for the same consistency as his.. Not much more. Best orange chicken recipe.! It does taste just like panda if not better.!
Panda Express chicken and beef has always tasted funny to me I'll pass
It came out exactly like Panda Express 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Orange chicken is such an american thing. It's supposed to be chinese but china didnt even have this to begin with.
GREAT video! thanks!
AP flour!! Just say all purpose flour goddamit
Panda express is fucking disgusting
where’s the orange
So I don't know what kind of cups he was using but I needed 3 1/2 cups of water
Thanks for that. Very different from my own experimental recipe where I used Marmalade, soy sauce and BBQ sauce. It worked well, even though I used beer batter. Probably a no no in yourt book ;-)
kwek kwek but chicken if your from philippines
THANK YOU OMG IVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.
Going to veganize this recipe.  Thanks
only problem is literally nobody has a deep fryer
*Good but not healthy* 😭😭😭😭😭😭
V is shaking🤣
Yum
Yessssssssss 🤤🤤
I love Chinese Chicken, Better than chicken Breast!
this is not Chinese food at all
Ok but it’s not actual Chinese food. It’s Americanized so what’s he mean when he says there’s no way to cheat Chinese food lmao
Oh cut the crap u guys use dead rat meat
What oil is he using?
They sell the Panda Express sauces at Walmart y’all!!
My mouth was waterring while watching this😛🤤
This recepe tastes amazing!!! I did add way more water to the flour mix....but it was a hit.....even my picky 5 year old hugged me after...we are in Quarantine...so have not had this in a while as we are staying home...she was ecstatic!! Thank u
Jammmmi
The orange should be fresch ?
Audio work is absolutely terrible
Will cook this for Taehyung 😏
V:I LoVe PanDa ExPresS
This is my favorite one!
I made this for dinner today. Sooo yummy🤤
I'm hungry.
@kimtaehyung
Way to caloric!
How does YouTube know I eat orange chicken last night 🤔😦🤯
https://youtu.be/NIFAvf1Wd8s
What kind of vinegar
Liar. Everything is frozen at panda Express. You're making it fresh.
this is too much work. easier to just go to panda express
DEAR GODDDDDD!😍🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Tasty 😋
There no panda express here, i guess. And i try the recipe and it taste good... well hope someday i can go to real panda express heheh
What type of pan is that
I made this tonight and it was delicious!! I’ve tried other orange chicken recipes and never turned out good but this one was great!!  I did have to add more water than what he said to because it turned out more like a dough instead of a batter but overall was really good 5 stars!
Maple syrup .

God damn i have to try this....now post the recipes for their teriyaki chicken, angus beef, lo mein and chicken kun pao!
I wonder if there’s a keto version of this.
is this recipe good for not  fried chicken ?
♥️
Why add sugar ?
Panda trash
If taehyung see this he will BE HAPPY TRUST ME
In 2012 I went to USA to work on a cruise ship, that's the first and the last time i work on cruise ship. when I arrived in tom bradley international airport i was so hungry but don't have enough money to buy any food. And came one of my senior associate and he said "I know you're hungry",he brought a box of food from panda express and asked me to join him having it since the portion was to big for him to ate it all alone. Inside the box there were rice, 2 dumplings and orange chicken. Thats the first and the last time i ate orange chicken. Thanks for giving the recipe, since i coudn't go to USA for the second time. This mean a lot for me. Thank you🙏
SOMEONE TELL AMBERLYNN
I can taste the sweet and sourness just by watching the video, definitely would try this and I am sure it's gonna be real good
I dont think I will be able to eat Chinese for awhile
Mañana lo preparare! Gracias
u damn right this is about 8 servings, and for a person with diebetes its probably double that. i made a big plate of about half of the full serving i barely could get through half the meal
Orange dogs? Orange Bats ?
Its too much sugar. Do you know what happens when you mix sugar with vinegar?  Too much sugar, ya'll always lose me with this sickening frenzy to have so much sugar in everything  ITS NOT NORMAL!!
Is it corona virus free?
Hey a great dish from one of the lowest quality Chinese food places in human history. 10/10
I will try this!!!!! 🤗🤗
Since I don't know if there are any Panda restaurant in Brazil, I think I'll try this recipe...
The fact that i want to try this but I'm allergic on chicken.
Am I the only one who never tried Panda Express here?              																																																	wow didn’t expect this to get 2k likes thanks (any one watches anime here?)
CAN YOU PLEASE STOP TALKING ?
The comment section is wild. 1/2 of people that commented a month ago about going to Pandas, half of people 2 days ago about not being able to leave and not having the resources to make this.. 2020 has hit us like a mofkr
Hello, my panda near my house uses some kind of dry skinny red chili peppers when they are making their orange chicken, but I don't see it in this recipe. Is this the original panda recipe or just a take on the orange chicken from Panda?
Best
Next is black bat soup.....
It cant be processed but it comes with corona virus
Eso es pollo a la naranja al estilo chino
Clicked immediately when i saw PANDA EXPRESS🤭🤭🤭 Courtesy of Mr Kim Taehyung🤩
Adorei a dica do empanado. A sobrecoxa está na promoção e é ótima pra este tipo de prato
extremely unhealthy eww
i thought he would put the actual orange there :)
Wow thats a lot of sugar, could it be done with honey??? I have a jar of non processed honey that a friend gave to me, I dont mind using a bit of sugar to smooth the acidic flavor of some things (like when making tomato sauce) but I dont like using big amounts of it. Looks delicious btw
Woww love this❤️❤️❤️
No orange in Panda Express orang chicken. Also chicken gets corn starch white pepper
People have been making orange chicken longer than the 80s mate. Just not this way
Does the chicken breast will work for this? Thanks!
This doesn't exist if you dont show the Walnut Shrimp recipe.
Um did I miss it or was there not anything orange in there lol... Shouldn’t there at least be orange zest or orange marmalade or something to give an orange flavor? That’s weird. I just checked the recipe on their site and nope nothing orange 🤷‍♀️
Romans 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9:27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10:9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. John 5:24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2:8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Jimmy Wang.. and you use, words like,"dark meat"... I bet you catch alot of slack...
That was alot of sugar.. I'd put half that guys
Bless all of you. I love panda!! Especially orange chicken. After hard days at work, I would get orange chicken and my day was 100x better! Always friendly staff wherever I went. Great company, great people, great food!
I always thought orange chicken had orange in it!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭     I hate you
I made this and it came out delicious!! I actually like it better than panda express!
I thought TRUMP was the Original “Orange Chicken”
Panda Express, BTS' favorite restaurant 😊😊😊
I’ve tried it, after you put the saus on the fried chicken, the crispiness will be gone, unfortunately
its my favorite
Well now I don’t have to go to Panda Express to get Coronavirus now so thanks
This recipe is lit! I followed the instructions and it tastes really good! 😋 I skipped the sesame oil at first because I didn't have it but the next time I cooked it, I had sesame oil, and was amazed how the taste was elevated all the more because of it. But thanks for this! 😊
Looks amazing.
Wait? Where is an orange in this recipe? Would it taste like orange chicken?
Ah, I’m guessing this is the homemade variant.
GREAT!!!!.........now I'm hungry😑
Half a cup of sugar on a plate of chicken?? No thanks
Why u gotta torture our stomachs while we’re quarantined 😫
In other words: Use everything
One time my mom told my brother that big he ate too much Panda Express he will turn into a panda
Can I substitute the chicken with bat (domestic, of course!)?
Italy
https://youtu.be/ocnqeqw7t8s
PandaExpress is garbage 🤮 🤮
oh i make it wrong way i guess😞
We saw on the news ; That someone just pissed on your drive thru & drove off just days ago
Damn this is way more complex than I thought
They sell the Panda Express Orange Sauce in stores. Heat it on the stove and add seasonings if you wish. Cook popcorn chicken/nuggets/tenders in the oven Pour sauce over chicken. Boom. Super easy, less ingredients and tastes the same.
My grandma makes this, but uses fried pork instead of chicken. IT’S REALLY REALLY GOOD
White meat sucks and dark meals rules.     Not homo
With Chinese food , you can’t cheat it!
Watching this during quarantine doesn’t make sense... am hungry and its late at night
Amazing
That's not the original sauce 🙄 there is no chilli flakes
Expectation: This beautiful hand made Orange Chicken. Reality: boxed, frozen bags of dark meat chicken bites and actual panda orange sauce uses vinegar, sugar, basic sauce (aka soy), water and orange extract. This recipe is bomb but this is not what you are served at Panda.
Yes
For some reason it bothered me that he used a fork instead of chopsticks to eat the chicken.
All this does is make me want to buy Panda Express lol Quarantine won't make us stop buying Panda! Also their fortune cookies ALWAYS come true!   __°□°_/  truuuuuue
1 1/2 cups of water is not enough for all that flour and cornstarch
I thought this was a how to basic vid 😒
All i need is Orange Juice & Cornstarch. Definitely going to buy the stuff when my toddler takes his nap.Lol
Enak 👍
We will all be bro chefs and bro bakers after the lockdown period 😂. I get to know my kitchen better day by day than before the lockdown 😂
great recip but orange chiken is from Hawaii
CALORIES
Oh no... its so much cheaper to have it made! There is noooo way to make it cheaper at home.
He should have been listing the ingredients instead of talking about nothing
I got reflux from watching this
🤤
I saw "Panda Express" and immediately I remembered Taehyung screaming: I LOVE PANDA EXPRESS😂
I cooked this recipie for my family today and it was just like the orange chicken younget from panda express and other food chains... very very delicious 😋 thanks for the recipie tasty :)
Is this recipe completely chinese or Indo-chinese, or something else?
Arguably, they're best entree!!!
I like your face.  You had me until the sesame oil.😒
Hmmmm nice very nice
I’m Taiwanese & when I found out that now Panda Express makes better Chinese food than y’all American born Chinese, I was mad disappointed.  No wonder western people can’t stand the food, even us can’t stand ya
It's basically Coca-Cola chicken
Yoooo now I'm STARVING 😭😭😭
Mine came out great.
This is by far the best recipe I’ve ever followed!! I am greatly thankful for uploading it. This is one of my favorite dishes, and to my unfortunate “disgrace” there are no Chinese restaurants in my town. And the few that there are in this State (I live in Chiapas south of Mexico), aren’t anywhere close to the flavor I was used to when living in Tijuana (where I am from). Now this has been the third time in a whole month I’ve done it, and can’t stop having it almost every weekend. You have no idea how happy you’ve made me. Even my husband used to dislike this dish in the Chinese food, but ever since I’ve prepared it following this video, he asks for more 😂 So on his behalf and myself, THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!
ليس صحي مع كورونا
Didn't used orange in orange chicken lmfao
Nice👍🏻
This recipe is so good. Just made it for my parents they loved it they never imagined a fifteen year old could cook this type of meal 😂😁
I’m so hungry now I could eat two sandwiches (made from this chicken)
Ap flour 😂
WOW. Probably the best WeightGainer I've ever seen. Better call it ProCarbo6000 - Orange Flavor
I know i am only one thinking about it but its fucking unhealthy
I actually tried this and it came out soo good!!
This was delicious! I don’t know if anyone else had a problem with this but when making the sauce I first had it on medium high like the recipe said but it very quickly burnt so I re-did it, over slightly under medium and that worked a lot better. Also I only had 1.25lbs of chicken and I still had some chicken leftover so either 1lb of chicken or more sauce next time! A couple of other comments mentioned this but it should be 2 1/2 cups of water not 1 1/2 for the batter, otherwise your going to have a dough. The frying took about 15 minutes to cook instead of 6-7, it’s possible I didn’t have it high enough but it was already slightly splattering so I didn’t want to turn it up. Lots of notes, but A couple of tweaks and next batch should be a bit easier! Still amazing though, highly recommend!
MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT TO GO IN THE USA. THANKYOU😭
I should probably stop watching these before bed. Hungry af now
Im watching this while I’m on my bed
bruh the ingredients prices are gonna stack up and be more expensive than panda express
The very best recipe so far, I just double the orange, vinegar, sugars to have even more sauce. I already did many times, the dough is perfectly crunchy. Great!
I just ate..now I'm hungry again.
im watching this during quarantine because im bored and want panda express 😔
I have just made it,it's delicious,thank you😍🤗
Where's the Orange?
Devil flour
Didn’t cut the fat out 😕
Could I try this with Franks Red hot rather than Soy sauce ?
I went to NY twice and the 2th time I looked for the Panda express near the Madison Square,  I loved the orange chiken, here in Argentina there's no Panda express :(
Oh man that looks good.

what can you do instead of frying???
Who else is watching this in quarantine rn
Scrumptious!
I have all the ingredients except for the chicken 😭
Warning: Do not watch this video WHILE FEELING HUNGRY!
RAT!!
For 600 gms chicken i made full quantity sauce   For 1/4 cups sugar i put 1 tbsp and for 2 tbsp cornflower i put 11/2 tsp         Hope it is helpful
I was so smirk eating orange chicken thinking I was eating Chinese food; then my Chinese friends were like WTF is that bro
When you're inside your home and you are on quarantine... Then this pops up, you watched and then you feel like.... You wanna scream your lungs out!!!
Took awhile to make, wasnt for me
i did it and it tastes EXACTLY as panda's. good for me. I live in brazil and we dont have it here. =)
Wow, now I feel compelled to try to make this. You guys make it look so simple
Funny how the guy at the end starts the nod of approval milliseconds after taking the first bite. At least wait a few seconds before you announce your approval:D
Looks really tasty, but sadly I'm not eating Sugars and allot of carbs, dropped from 38" to 32" waist just doing that. But enjoy it people I'd love to eat it all.👍🏻😁
Never would've expected this would be porn during the 2020 quarantine.
I was about to head out when they didn’t season the actual chicken but I guess that juicy sauce is flavorful enough 🤷🏽‍♀️
Going 💯 against nature
What's Panda Express?
no more chinese food, chinese anything...
okay so I made this today and it was actually really good
Not a fan of sugar
Yummy 😋
Nice food 👌👌
So the vinegar is it just white vinegar? Or like apple vinegar?

I love Panda Express
STOP EATING ANIMALS' FLESH AS  TO WHY WE HAVE ALL THESE VIRUSES. LEAVE THEM ALONE.
Here's how we are going to make the original corovirus
Excelente 👏👏👏🇲🇽
I would prefer it with breast meat. It’s deep fried so it won’t be dry anyway.
looks temptingly yummy delcious!
I just made the sauce and it’s amazing!
I didn’t try , but I think is very nice 👍🏽 👌🏽😘 🍽🥖🍋 😌😌
yoooo, Jimmy Wang was on Chopped. The Pizza Perfect episode, he’s amazing.
Chinese food spreads corona
This was good...thank you! #fromapregnantmama
Wowzer ❤️
Yum!!
Can i substitute de vinegar with the apple vinegar??
No thank you I don't want coronavirus 🤷‍♂️
Gonna try this
That looked soooo nice
It bothers me that he did not put all the chicken in the pan
Yall, I used to cook for panda, let me tell you, we do none of this, your chicken comes frozen from a bag and thrown into a vat boiling oil to "cook". the sauce we use comes from a large bucket and boiled until it is thick. Also fun fact, anything cooked with mushrooms you should steer clear of, panda doesn't clean th cow poop stuck on the mushrooms before cooking.
Wow it's so easy thank you but I don't want to add this much sugar what should I do? 😭
So I’ve never had orange chicken. It look delicious
I made this yesterday, it came out so nice. Thank you
I want to make this but my country is on lockdown
Ew that's why orange chicken taste nasty that sause has everything in it
Taste better when someone else cooks it!
Fk stomach growling at 2am. Damnit
👍🏻👍🏻
I’m 99% sure I’ve seen a cook at Panda Express dump a large bag of breaded chicken into the wok before pouring sauce on it.
Thanks for sharing unique recipe👍
Wow
So is this cheaper to make or cheaper to buy?
nice
My mouth is watering, it looks delicious. 😋
I’m watching this at 1 AM. Why do I always do this to myself?
I’m ahead of this. I make better orange chicken using the orange sauce from Panda Express at my grocery store
White people think this the real orange ck, panda Express is White people Chinese food, stupid.
1 and 1/2 cup of water ?? Lol ??? Use ml pls :)))
I don't think panda express is original Chinese food.
The only Chinese food I usually get😂love it
*you s*ck at cooking yea you totally s*ck*
Imma make this tomorrow
😋😋😋😋😋
This recipe is a pure bullshit. For 1 cup cornstarch and 3 cups flour just 1.5 cup water there will be dough but not batter.
Anyone else think Panda Express sucks??
Can you do the same with fish?
i love this recipe.! is perfect..
amberlynn reid watched this atleast 100 times
This recipie is perfect .It came out so good and my kids loved it
The quarentine looking so good 😤
Unhealthy recipe (corn starch and white sugar). Instead of sugar you can use pure honey and fresh orange juice.
Looks easy. Don't be lazy foos.
Could you make the Batsoup that fucked the whole world?
if you add 3 cups of flour and 1.5 cup of water, it doesn’t look like in the video. It will need more than 1.5 cup of water. MISLEADING RECIPE!!!!
Awesome 😋😋😋😋😋
What can we use instead of orange juice???? Plsss telll meee
Hi everyone tell me what you think about my channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuMrLZR_viDmkrvILK5lQiQ
YAY!!!
What do you do with the oil after frying the chicken ?
Inwas a head cook at panda and i can definitely say this is not how you make panda orange chicken
This is not "really good", this is AMAZING. It tastes delicious, it's actually very easy to make once you have your ingredients ready, I loved it!
The whole thing sounds like a rap song !
https://youtu.be/BNdj7xnGYWM try this for italian food lovers..👍
**stomach growls**
So much sugar in it
Can you please do a recipe on the chicken from  Chipotle???
Corona
Where’s the orange? Just the juice?
while watching the video: "hmm I can do that.."  after watching the video:"hmm.. I can't do that."
Who else is about to attempt this? Lol he made this look so easy...
Put extra sugar in my sauce I want diabetes really bad
I usually have my own recipes but this one is SO good! Can’t stop making it.
Don't cut chicken on a wooden cutting board.
TOO many carbs.
Making this dish this weekend with some fried rice on the side. Wish me luck my fellow cooks!!
0:54 AMERICA WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
There's a disturbing lack of Monosodium Glutamate in this recipe, therefore it's definitely not *exactly* the same as Panda Express
*People don't like processed food* Well, hate to tell you this, but cooking food is a process, thus everything you eat is processed. If you buy skinless, boneless chicken thighs, guess what..... *PROCESSED*
Can you do the orange sauce in a big quantity and reheat it whenever you want to use it ? Making a big batch for the long term would be quite handy when an orange chicken crave appears.
I never comment for recipes and stuff but honey goes great instead of the sugar
Mmmmmmh loooooove it!!!!
where the recipe for coronavirus chinese bat soup? yummy. pls make that/
I followed the recipe exactly, but ended up with a super dry dough. What could have gone wrong?
hug to hug guys
Looks great but you need to throw some sesame seeds and maybe a touch of red pepper on that bad boy chicken. Gonna be bland if you don't.
Convincing presentation
To be specific, what type of Orange Juice? Like is there a specific brand? Also what type of soy sauce?
Panda express orange chicken is nothing. You should try Sam woo's.
Panda
its yummy....thankyou for share us your recipe
I wonder if this guy's liable for copyright infringement from panda express
Is this a joke? The ratio of flour and water will make a dough not a batter.. This is a recipe for disaster.. Well done tasty. 👊 Absolute Flop.
Now i want some Chinese 😭😭
The amount of sugar 😱😅
The truth is there really isn't any orange flavor in it.
I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it ! 😊
Money saver. Thank you.
I made this over the weekend for dinner. I loved it so much.  I did do a few changes though.  Mainly i added the sesame oil in the batter instead of at the end and added a bit more orange juice.  I think the only real issue i had was  frying the chicken. Some of the chicken came out nice and crispy, but on others the breading started falling off the chicken. I'm not sure what i was doing wrong. Maybe it was the temperature? I'd have to make it again to test.
Can i subtitute the orange with lemon?
nothing makes me drool like this
Tantrum: has left the chat
Anyone know what kind of vinegar he use? Cause i use white vinegar for this recipe and now its inedible because its too sour 😂
My teacher used to say, "Panda's sugar meat will be the death of me!". lol
It's my 4th time making this and I can say this recipe is the best! I do the batter at night and cook it next morning. Saves time!
Still no one's going to be making this at home 😂😂
If you like orange chicken, next time you're in a Chinese restraint try ordering "Peking Pork Chops (京都排骨) ". This dish is much more tasty.
Panda Express is gross in my city 😩
This is not an easy recipe to make, but it is well worth the time and work to make it once you taste it. I have made this twice in the last two weeks with the Panda Express Orange sauce that sells at Walmart, and it’s been incredible both times. It really does taste just like you are at Panda Express. I’m sure it’s even better to make the sauce homemade and look forward to trying that too.
Please tell me do you use fresh orange juice or store bought
Too bad orange chicken is the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. Just me though. The only asianish food I've ever thrown away after tasting.
I just wrapped my chicken in Jaffa cakes and it worked perfectly
Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.
I thought this was a howtobasic video
I was eating orange chicken back in 1979 and 1980 at mr. Nissan Merritt islandan orange chicken and orange beef on their menu.. so I don't think that guy from Panda Express was the originator
2:00
I added 1 tablespoon of white pepper and didnt realize it's supposed to be a teaspoon... I hope it doesnt taste too bad.
I used to work at Panda Express. At least mine, the sauce is premade
Who thought it was howtobasic first? I know I am an idiot LMFAOO
You're not missing much if you don't go to Panda Express. Kimonos or this place called Jade Garden was always better.
Oh yeah, Chinese food (frozen) "is never processed." Tha's why  I go do my local market in the freezer section and buy it buy the ton.
Salt?
Do I really need to add sesame oil to it?
I am planning to go home,i am at school right now, and make this at home but yeaa  i remember no land meats todayyy !! Ash wednesdayy!
I like how you made all the peices small. I get grossed out by the huge chunks you often find at chinese places.
Watch rekha's rasoi channel it's original authentic Indian food recipes.
Gonna try it on da weekend
Kim Taehyung: I love Panda Express!!!!!!
I remember panda express when y crush v mention it....
Real Chinese cooking!
Panda express SUCKS
It’s Orange Chicken tomorrow for dinner
My name is Jimmy Wang. Proceeds and eats chicken with fork.
I very much dislike Orange chicken but this was cool to watch
Me:*questions wat orange chicken tastes like* -Few seconds later- Me:*is literally sweet n sour pork but chicken*
Panda express is probably the most over rated place. Next to Disney and Chipotle
Panda Express 💜🐯❤
This video is fake, they are using chicken instead of cat
Just made this. I added shallots, red and green chilies to the orange sauce while it reduced.  ....it was amazing!
oh this is the meal that amberlynn reid always have, i didn't know it was chinese food 😳
It doesn’t even taste the same...
It looks so easy!! Thanks for the recipes 😊
This is not Chinese btw
Is corn starch the same as cornflour in th UK? Thanks
Si me salió :')
Made this for dinner last night it was soooooo delicious
This is really good?
The original orange chicken was bone in...
I LOVE orange chicken! 😍😍😍
Our Taehyung loves panda express.....
All my panda does is get the frozen chicken, deep frie it and add the sauce
Amberlynn would loveee this xghfhghh
Get your recipe straight. It can't be one cup of cornstarch, three cups of flour, one egg and 1 and 1/2 cups of water! I have very thick dough right now! 😡
Eat your cereal
Went to PE once....Realised they couldn't make ONE dish without putting so MANY onions in it that ALL you tasted was onions.....NEVER been back!!!! Pretty BAD when they're even in the Pesi!!!! 😒👎👎
The buffet kind is always to sweet but Panda Express 🤤
I could probably eat that whole. Then 20 minutes later want more.
I'm trying to make this right now and it's frustrating as fuck! Followed your exact recipe and my batter just turned out like a big ball of dough. No fucking watery batter like yours. Just a big clump of dough. Like wtf is up with that?
Ale bym wpierdalał... Good job!
If i am making orange chicken from scratch i am not going to make the panda version!
This looks so healthy
"Original" and "Panda Express" in the same sentence? 🤔
That’s what goes in? Oh no😩🙈😭
Too many steps the chicken has no nutrition att all
It’s great when the ingredients are not exaggerated. You can easily find it in small markets.
I remember when Panda Express didn't serve 5 day old food and it was actually edible...I miss those days.
This looks so much better than what I had in Panda Epress! On wait,,,
Love this .
🤢🤮
He looked like he scraped his tooth 😖 did anyone else cringe???
hm anyone having trouble with the measurement of flour?? 3 cups looks lot for me for the water he measures... or im doing wrong? every time i do it i get very dense and not watery as like him. if anyone know, please help me! thank you
I just had panda express orange chicken today! so yummy😊
Why this look more more fresh and better than how we do it at panda 😂
Do they have a recipe that doesn't  give you the trots?
At least I'm not watching a white guy make Asian food,unlike those lidl recipe books..
M S G
I'm so hungry... Let's get cookin!!
"Original" orange chicken? I take that to mean this is an old defuct recipe they no longer use. Still, it looks delicious, so I'm going to make it anyways.
Заебали вы со своим маслом
I didn't even know there is such a dish in Chinese cuisine.
Could be interesting with tofu as a vegetarian option
As a Chinese studied in America for six years. let me tell you that panda express make the worst Chinese food.
Making this at home seems like a complete chore. I'll rather just go get the lunch special for 6 bucks cos I want people to make food for me I am a prince
Anyone saying they followed this recipe and it turns out successful was lying. Why? Because it should be 1 cup of flour, not 3 as called for in the video. You're getting bread dough, not flour at 3 cups
Lol real maple syrup is thinner
How does anyone give this a thumbs down?
It does look nice and probably taste devine but damn, why so many ingredients? If I buy every condiments on theses recipes I'll have more condiments than proper food.
wait...  THERE ISN'T ANY ORANGE USED FOR THE ORANGE CHICKEN? !!! (mind blown)
Half a cup of sugar yo.
Am I the only one that cuts of fat etc from chicken   that puts me right off !!
Idk, but I know damn well my local Panda Express doesn’t go through this process.
Damn that’s a lot of sugar!
Secret Ingredients: Its all really Rats and diced mices... "Fried-Chicken"  is the cover up phrase, simply because there is no chicken ever anywhere, only rat cages...
Why in God's name would you eat that slop from panda cafe. I gave a homeless guy the balance of my gift card, he gave it back said he didnt want the runs
Frango com mimosa?
This made me want orange chicken for lunch.
When you live in the UK and don't have a Panda Express 😭 whyyyyy
1:36 MSG
rice in oven, come and subscribe me♥️ https://youtu.be/aY6ST3UzAKU
I've been watching this all day. Omg! I need a life but I need orange chix more. Lol
I literally did the same exact measurements like him, but my mixing came out as a fucking rock while his is liquid
Just tried the recipe, think I’d rather go pay 9 bucks than to spend 2 hours making it.
That’s really cool he shares the restaurant recipe
I loved eating these in China ❤️ I’m gonna try to replicate them xD 我爱中国
I had a seizure trying to keep up with the subs at the bottom and ingredients at the top! Smh
This doesn't look like that one they have at panda Express lol, plus they use frozen ass chicken haha
I have to make it at home, because I always have an allergic reaction to the store bought way.
Yum 😋
"we start with fresh chicken" at Panda Express? seems doubtful
Being a native Chinese, growing up in Mainland China, I’ve never even heard of Orange Chicken..... but ok....
Looks better than what Panda Express has in store.
So gros just americans can eat that much sugar with something like meat
Im so hungry
This is why orange chicken is my comfort food. Shit ton of sugar, fat and carbs.
Please don't ever use the word panda in a cook video.
1:37 First off… this is not chinese food. This is an American impression of what chinese food would be.
bruh, the amount of sugar XD
Did I hear him right that " with Chinese food there are no short cuts" come on fam Chinese food is fake I won't be surprised if they say dog meat is chicken meat
Holy sh**. Now I know the recipe I'll be set for life.
How to make orange chicken at home: Buy a panda express branch. Move all the tables and make it look like your home. Order chef to cook.
I am seeing this with a empty stomach
Anyone after coronavirus
Anybody tried this recipe? How does it turn out?
George Kittle approves.
panda  ornge chiken  the orange chiken is from hawaii
Just get the Orange Chicken from Trader Joe’s. It’s quick less messy and most important Tasty....
Very delicious 😋
Kept a straight face at the end. Impressive.
I'm so hungry!!!
Brah if anybody coming to Hawaii make sure you stop by foodland and get orange chicken from dem way more bettah
PANDA EXPRESS wOO
Panda Express orange chicken gives me anxiety every time is eat it the following night in my sleep.  I’m very conscious about the reaction of foods I put in my body and as much as I love it, it’s dangerous to my gut health and state of being.  I’m not sure if it’s the chicken itself or the additives and sauce.  I won’t be eating this anymore
Fake dish
.....goes to Panda Express and orders orange chicken, honey walnut prawn w/steamed rice
You go too fast
Panda Express is crap!
You would think this is confidential, but he was like "eh fuck it"
Hey the chef in the video was my teacher in Culinary School at Le Cordon Bleu! I know that voice anywhere! He was a beast!!!
Do you have the recipe for lemon bats?
Chicken thighs 2 lbs cut into 1 inch cubes  • Batter:  1 tbsp Salt 1 tsp White pepper 1 cup Cornstarch  3 cup Flour 1 Egg 2½ cup Water – Dunk the chicken cubes into the batter, chill for 30mins – Fry at 350°F/177°C 25 pcs at a time min. 6mins, dont get it too brown  • Sauce:  1 tsp Vegetable Oil ¼ tsp Chilli Flakes 1 tbsp Garlic (preferably minced) ½ tsp Ginger (idem) ¼ cup White Sugar  ¼ cup Brown Sugar ¼ cup Orange Juice ¼ cup Vinegar  2 tbsp Soy Sauce  – Stir the sauce, when it's simmering add slurry (2 tbsp water + 2 tbsp cornstarch) then mix in the fried chicken.   ⚠my not so important opinion; you may use whole chicken— cut into small parts or chicken breast instead. if you do so look up on how to marinate (with milk/cola) before putting them into the batter.
no wonder this thing has a billion calories oil into more oil
The Panda Express I’ve been to likes to give you a lot of fried batter with very little chicken. I will never eat there again.
What kind of vinegar?
Damn so I'm like addicted to general tsos and orange chicken and really been wanting a wok so when I went to the store to get a couple ingredients I was missing to make this the only Wok I saw was a Tasty brand one.  So I grabbed it.  $19.99 not bad.  Used this recipe and it was pretty good but the sauce was way too sweet so I added extra soy sauce and salt and about another 1/3 cup of orange juice.
WOWOW..I DEFINITELY HAVE TO TRY THAT RECIPE. IT SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH. &MOST OF THE INGREDIENTS ARE IN MY CABINET!!😁
PAnDa ExPreSs woo PaNdA ExpReSs
OMG who else is just *CRAVING* this!
My mom tried this recipe! It was good but I would recommend a bit less soy sauce
Just made this and was absolutely fantastic
I would recommend to use 2 1/2 cups of water instead of the 1 1/2 mentioned in the video. I was confused as to why the batter had a dough consistency before reading another comment about adding more water.
V secretly in the corner -  PANDAAAAAAAA EXPREEEESSSSSSS!!!!
Omg wow tasty
I cooked it just now and its really good!sad tho I don't have the sesame oil.maybe next time😅
All these ppl without ingredients  well im a cook st a sushi place and im making it for fsmily meal right now
Dope
What kind of vinegar should you use?  Also does using low acid OJ change anything?
The nearest Panda Express is an hour away for me, so thank you!  Appreciate it.
What kind of oil do I use to fry?
Happy cooking us support 😇🙏🙏 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOU-khRIlT4VEZ3i3piPQng
Its 3 am, I'm on my bed, I can't cook this now... but oh bab, I wanna eat that right away-
I made this tonight from the video. It was good but way too sweet. I'd make these changes next time: -Use 50% less sugar. Also reduce the vinegar. -Add some more orange juice. -Double the sauce.
Damn I miss pandaexpress
Do we really have to use sugar n brown sugar?
Please  tell spicy dishes
Whats the purpose of this recipe if your lazy ass holds you back.....  Better Go To Panda😂
To go with this, Panda Express fried rice (copycat):  3 tablespoons oil  2 eggs , beaten  6 cups cooked white rice , cooled  1/4 cup soy sauce  1 cup frozen peas and carrot mix  1 teaspoon sesame oil  Put the oil into the wok and heat on high. Add in the eggs and stir, cooking and breaking it into smaller pieces until fully cooked. Add in the cooled white rice,  soy sauce, carrots and peas and toss. Add in the sesame oil and mix.
Im totally making this
I made this exactly as the recipe is, and it turns out amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Kim taehyung : I love panda express
Okay...SO. I made this. Did what commenters said - and I basically halved the flour and corn starch and still had plenty for 500g of chicken (1 pound about). After I combined the chicken with the sauce - most of the breading came apart and mine had the consistency of the guy exactly in this video. Most remained in tact...but this recipe was missing an essential "crunch" factor entirely...I even added the egg, despite thinking it was pretty stupid (as eggs don't actually levean batter unless they're beaten somewhat vigorously).  Overall, disgusting and I wasted 1 pound of chicken. Absolutely awful experience. I will not be making it like this ever again. I'm very well versed in culinary arts and even worked in a professional capacity. I say - be wary of this and most people saying how "amazing" it is. From most of their pictures, it looks just like mine, but it was absolutely not even close to Panda Express. And go figure - why would they reveal how they make it anyways? Less $ for them. This is some ghetto-fied easy-at-home recipe.
Am I the only one that made the batter that felt like there wasn’t enough water? I feel like I was adding it and it just made a ball of dough instead of a batter. I had to add a lot more to get it to look like the consistency of the video.
Amazing recipe I tried it and it tasted amazing
I can't sleep. i'm gonna try to make this instead.... it's making me hungry...
Uhm... u didn’t use orange or even orange juice
I made this Recipe and to start with the flour mixture along with the water measurements are not right. At first the dough was dry, it needed more water so I had to add 3/4 with a bit tad more water so it can be the same consistency as his was. Then once I was doing the frying the chicken did not even stay crispy I was chewy....PLEASE DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY IN TRYING TO ATTEMPT THIS RECIPE. It’s a FLOP!  WORST ORANGE CHICKEN RECIPE!
if I'm allergic to eggs is there a substitute I can use for the egg?
Thighs thighs thighs.. breast is garbage 😆
I did exactly what u said and it came out doughy smh You said 1 cup 1/2 water but thats wrong
I love their orange chicken!!
I watch this video cause Taehyung said this 😂
I wonder if you could do this with tofu
Should dreg chicken it's crispier. Than a battered chicken
SO FREAKING GOOD!!!  Worth the effort + I made some fried rice too
Who has actually tried this recipe? Because it did not work. First of all the amount of water they say you need for THREE CUPS OF FLOUR AND 1CUP OF CORNSTARCH makes a dough not a batter. I’m fucking confused. I just wasted 3 cup of flout, 1 cup of cornstarch and and egg. 🤬  Edit: I tried again and to make a batter I needed more than 3 cups of water! Wtaf? Last time trying one their recipes because the measurements are never right.
Watching while eating Orange Chicken at Panda Express!
Panda express, nasty. Gave my gift card to a homeless guy. Hope he doesnt get sick too
Heads up, if you’re going to make it with chicken breast, use just corn flour and 2 eggs to make a batter. You can marinate the breast meat with just salt & pepper and half the juice of an orange, roughly 2 tablespoons. Their recipe will not work with chicken breast unless you thin out the batter. Good luck!
already on it
*Chinken nuggets*
Very informative
How many servings is this?
Ladies... if he introduces himself and his name is Jimmy Wang, _he's the one_
Watching while eating orange chicken-
This recipie is the best one really corrected my past mistakes thanks
Pray and fast in jesus name for perfect health and youthful body.   You will live forever and never die.
Can we use honey instead of brown sugar?
Wonderful
That’s not the recipe Panda Express uses 😢
So i tried this recipe and it wass wonderfulll😋😋. Exact same like panda express👍👍  I used half of the cornflour, flour and the sugars, and it turned out good.  2tbsp cornflour at the end seemed a lot. It became lumpy. So i would consider using just 1 tsp next time.  Rest all was the same. Will definitely try it againn. Same like Panda Express!!!😋😋😋
مشتركة جديدة من العراق 💔🇮🇶♥️👍🏻
Or you could just  go to  Panda express  ...
The worst recipe I have ever seen
One thing I'm sure of   v will definitely like that recipe 👌🏻
What kind of oil
Making this today like right now. Super baked and got the munchies. I will meet the challenge and eat well 💯 Tasty
Good
Can we substitute the sesame oil with anything else. (For allergy reasons)or We can omit the Sesame oil and we get the same result?
👌👍😍
I fucking hate Panda Express
Do I have to refrigerate for 30 min or just let it chill in the room temperature? Thank you so much in advance ;)
Might actually try making this but just using store sauce.
Can I use other chicken parts aside thigh? I don't like chicken thigh for some reason
There's a piece of orange sitting there unused the whole time
What oil did they use at 0:52 ?
This looks so good. What is the object called that you are using to take the chicken out of the oil with? I need one of those.
Ohhh yesss!😍
Ya i would love to taste panda cooked by asians not mexicans 😂 although it is still very good!!
Thanks bish.
Made this yesterday and it was AMAZING! Thank you so much.
Lmao!!!!! Pandas Orange Chicken comes in as frozen Tyson nuggets or boneless wings and the sauce is made with orange extract, cooking wine, 10 qts of “panda basic sauce” which is a concoction of ingredients a list as long as my arm that comes in big white buckets. It’s used as a base for most of their sauces. Also 10 qts of sugar, equal ratio to basic sauce then finally corn starch. This recipe in the video is the authentic version. Panda is still just fast food don’t be fooled
Damn! I’m hungry!!!
Anyone made this ?how was it
?
I don’t have any flower can I just use corn starch
Too many ipjoneads
A-Army?
This is not a good recipe. if this guy's a real chef he's making this intentionally bad to get you to eat at panda. You gotta twice fry the chicken and omit the yolk to get something that sticks together and the sauce tastes nothing like the orange chicken at panda express
Anybody else stoned and watching at 3 am cause panda is closed
That looks so frakkin good      But why do it remind me of taehyung lol shout out to the armys
Big fan of orange and honey chicken..tried out this recipe today and it was AMAZING!
Fucking sugar again its gonna ruin it.
Cool :) I'm cooking fried chicken breasts and watching this ;)
Вери гуд!
Made this tonight came out soo good!
Made it today and turned out super good. Loved every bite
Damn YT, i just talked to my mom few minutes ago regarding me wanting to cook orange chicken tomorrow. And here you are suggesting this to my wall. Are you listening to our conversation? Creepy🤔
I couldn’t believe he used a fork to eat it
I followed this recipe exactly and omg it came out so good!! Literally taste better than Panda Express and I love Panda express!!
Instead of using sugar or brown sugar chilli sauce will be good ....
Naughty Chiken-san u got me!!!
Looks so good...
I have to try This one
I love your recipes but just don't like sugar in my food
That was great I will try your recipe nice and easy...thank you
I did this and it tasted like shit
....or you can just go buy it from Panda Express. 🤷‍♂️
I need me a chinese girlfriend i dont feel like making this everyweek
Nah I'll just rather eat the chicken by itself with a lil bit of salt n peppa! 😉
Tempting.... 😋😋
How can someone eat sweet chicken 🤦‍♂️
Their orange chicken is not very tasty. The best orange chicken is in Sam Woo restaurant.
I feel sorry for the chumps who watch and never cook. This shit is delicious.
Made this once and it was very labor intensive and costly but delicious. Just don’t see myself making it again.
I would still season the shit out the chicken before putting it in the batter.
When I looked at it, I remembered Ramsay reaction to food. 😂😂  Too much oil😂 Anyway looks great❤👋
I don’t know how Panda Express tastes like but this recipe turned out nice. I would definitely double the amount of sauce because I cooked only 600 grams of chicken and felt like I could have used more sauce. Maybe also add a bit less sugar.
I'm too lazy at the moment, so I'm gonna go hit up Panda Express. Brb.
If its okay if i used breast instead of thigh?
Panda Express aint real Chinese food💩
...panda 🤢
Im sure hamberlynn will be mukbanging her way to this orange chicken.... type of situation.. can’t stand that bitch....
We don't have any orange chicken in Europe.. its a shame.  I will try to make this recipe in the weeks. <3
Tasty and healthy and easier 😉
Can't I just use the orange chicken panda express sauce from Walmart or is that not as good as this?
Would love to try this soon! Looks soo yumy
One day, I'll be broke because of this channel
Orange chicken?  Nah.. it is sugar chicken.  American Chinese food is one of the most unhealthy food in the market.  If you want to eat healthy Chinese food, go authentic!
I'm allergic to soy. Is it possible to opt out the soy sauce?
I seen how they make it, and they do not make it like this at panda express. They dont use fresh chicken they use frozen chicken and they fry it then they use the orange chicken sauce.
I don't fry my chicken that way.. Korean style & frying twice keeps it crunchy when tossing into sauce.. That being said.. your sauce is out of this world..
This looks delicious, thanks for sharing the recipe... Dark meat is moist anyway. I prefer it to breast meat...
Bruh I just learned how to make my favorite meal
Or just use bbq sauce with orange marmalade, brown & white sugar, ginger ,garlic... just saying..
Should have read the comments first. 😂 yeah to get the same consistency with the batter I had to use two cups of water, 2 eggs, and 1 more tbs of oil.. Its embarrassing that you can't get the measurements right tasty.... Just saying.
Too much sugar 🤢🤢🤢 once I've tried sweet n sour chicken and then I got a stomach ache
My question is why tf you chopping chicken on a wood cutting board.
When you follow the recipe to the dot and it comes out similar to caramel apples, yuck!
He didn't trim the chunks of fat of that chicken.  That's gross.  I think that when you don't care enough to trim the fat off that you don't care about the person eating it.  It's going to be covered in that batter and you're not going to know it's there until you're chewing it and you'll FEEL that soft chunk of chewy fat in your mouth.  Ewww 😭😲
Next time i am definitely giving tip. So much effort and food science
PANDA EXPRESS is soooooo nasty!!! I think they use actual pandas. Blech!!
I tried the original one but tbh i dont think fruit and meat is the best combination
Goddamn how much sugar? Looks delicious though.
Looking at this video sayin I have that ingredient and got that and got that.... DAMN! DONT HAVE THAT INGREDIENT...🤦
Panda 🐼 express sucks. Just come come to my house and I’ll shit on your plate. Same thing.
Panda Express is processed food! This is made from scratch not the orange chicken we buy from the restaurant.
Orange chicken?is that what Trump eats?
The way that chicken fell onto that plate😍... PS: It's 2:37 am in India right now and I'm watching this laying on my bed🤦‍♂️
Use orange fanta instead of sugar. Makes a difference
What would you call a vegetarian watching this video ?
I made this and uhh.... It was pretty bad...
Plz like if anyone else was eating store bought orange chicken while watching this
I have achieved maximum food horniness
CHICKEN  2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs(905 g) 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon white pepper 1 cup cornstarch(125 g) 3 cups flour(375 g) 1 egg 1 ½ cups water(360 mL) 2 tablespoons oil 6 cups oil(1 ½ L), for frying ORANGE SAUCE  1 tablespoon oil ¼ teaspoon chili flake 1 tablespoon garlic, minced ½ teaspoon ginger, minced ¼ cup sugar(50 g) ¼ cup brown sugar(55 g) ¼ cup orange juice(60 mL) ¼ cup white distilled vinegar(60 mL) 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons water 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 teaspoon sesame oil
does it matter if I use two cups of flour?
This is discu9
People, you should double the sauce because this recipe does not give you enough to go around!
Can’t wait to make this today.
I'd take off the fat. Nasty in my opinion.
I just made this, I would double the red pepper flakes. I did skip the sesame oil. It was my first time making this, it was great. I didn’t taste the spice I did double fry the chicken. I fried the first batch, then the second. Then refried the 1st for 2 mins. Added the 2nd batch for another 2 mins. Like Maangchi does on her videos.
Is Brown sugar a must?
I dont believe they do this all the time at Panda Express
thank you for this.
Why give out the recipe
Thumbnails out here killing man
Every time I eat panda express which I love...it gives me super shits
Fun fact: Orange chicken isnt an authentic Chinese dish
im hungry....
The only ones who follow the real recipes everytime is Whataburger! 100%
I made this recipe. Whoever who wants to make it, the measurements they suggest aren't accurate that's to much flour and cornstarch for 1 1/2 cup of water, you will need more water for those measurements.  You can do 1 each flour and cornstarch and add the egg and then add the water little by little until you get the consistency. Remember not to add that much salt if you do less flour and cornstarch. I suggest you add the salt little by little. The next time I will double the recipe for the sauce, the sauce came to shy. I am thinking that they didn't gave the right measurements and they did it  on purpose. I even added more orange use.
I literally just know that taehyung have seen this video
Now I know why it has so many calories
I came here because of food wars! Shokugeki no soma
Chicken Fried Rice   https://youtu.be/U4s9f3SFKxY
And I am here starving st 2AM
I was doing this, and I started eating it while it didn't have sauce. Send Help. Please
You know black people love them some orange chicken.
Hey my dad’s name is Jimmy Wang
WHY DOES THIS HAVE 2.3K DIS LIKES?? MAN. ORANGE CHICKEN IS HEAVENLY AND SORTA HEALTHY LOL
2.5 cups water not 1.5. Double even triple the sauce recipe if you want a recipe more like pandas chicken. AND WATCH THE SAUCES AS IT SIMMERS, IT WILL TURN FAST AND IF YOU DONT WATCH IT YOUR CHICKEN WILL TASTE LIKE CARAMEL :)) Cheers!
the measurement are wrong ..you'll need more than 1 1/2 cup water to make the batter
Yummy
Does anyone else watch food videos while starving?
¡ shareeee ! 🙂🤗🙂🤗🙂
It has FUCKIN SUGAR in it?
PANDA PANDA PADA EXPRESS
I never see  the meat at panda like  this one soooo diferente!
Noisy!!
kinda wanted him to say “that’s some good fuckin chinese food” at the end lmao
Amberlyn.
2:46 so HOT!!
🤤🤤
That's nice and all but to be honest, I'm not a big fan of panda express, you're better off going to your local Chinese restaurant, because panda is sub par at best compared to that
Anyone remember when they changed their fried rice but it sucked so they had to change it back?
I tried this recipe but mine came out a lil too sweet so I’m thinking I added too much but overall really great video I just should measure better && also I don’t wanna make 2lbs of chicken since I’m cooking for one :/
I love, is yummy.
Thank you !!!!!
Panda Express is the worst take out/ fast food there is! I got food poisoning there, ate there two times, never again. Pooly managed chain.
Yay now I don’t have to waste a lot of money on Panda Express:)
Do you use toasted sesame oil?
he didn't say "ohhh yeeahh"
Panda Express- Kim TaeTae
I feel so hungry right now
Let me show this to my mom so I can eat it🤦‍♀️ (my mom thinks it’s dog)
just a little brown sugar? hmmm...
I just made this - it DOES taste just like Panda's!  But, it was a lot of work (doubled the recipe to feed my brood) so for the time it took me I'll probably stick to buying it at Panda for now.  Frying that much chicken in batches took all the time - the sauce was a breeze!
How healthy or unhealthy is this?
Who is here after BTS said they like Panda Express?     Only me? Ok
I tried the same thing that he does and it taste horrible I hate it
Made this for dinner and it was reallllllyyyy good. I followed the instructions exactly but I ended up using way more than 1 & 1/2 cup water in the batter to get it the consistency in the video. Also Next time Im gonna use chicken breast instead of thighs.
I am hugryyyyyyyyyyyy
How can i share my Personal Recipes with Tasty?
Hi, is the cornstarch necessary?
Rea
They sell it in a bottle lmao!
I love Panda Express's Orange Chicken when I was living in the US, and missed eating it after coming home to Australia. Now I can make this at home! 😀☺🤤
Yummy 😋 my favourite dish💕
They forgot to put MSG on the dish.
I HATE sesame oil! I wanna taste garlic and spice and onions... not nuts... but that’s my opinion 🤷🏼‍♂️
I bet the food at Panda can be better home made probably or by a real chef
You "the us citizens" must be cariful about corn and soya. Many cancers origin is in that foods.
looks good but thinking of those ingredients in chicken is nauseating 😷
how does it taste?? sweet?? or sour like how???
Why is the chick+batter chilled before frying? To firm up the batter or sumfin? The oil cools rapidly when putting cold stuff in....
Wow
Sooooo guttt habe es nachgemacht
This dish is very sweet.. that's why I give you dislike
I do this with pre-fried frozen bites, I put it in an air fryer and go do the sauce... epic lunch in about 15 minutes its incredible.
Now i just need a video for the sweet fire chicken
👍👌🇲🇽👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏!!!!!
Can you show us how to make a chicken nugger?
Eso es marinera con salsa
I made this and it it turned out delicious....my 19 year old son ate most of it. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Thanks so much for posting...
orange juice!?!?!?
I'll try
Came here just to see behind Amberlynn Reid's obsession towards orange chicken...never tasted the dish before..hmm...
I followed this recipe and baby let me tell you!!!! Sooo amazing 😍😍
Tengo 3 horas haciendo este maldito pollo. Me suda hasta en los huecos de la nariz!
Tried it, it's very good. Just not 100% Panda Express, but still goood
Thats not healthy at all :D
"Not being processed" You got white flour there, you got sugar and your deep frying it my man
Cool
i thought he said leavening asian XD
the original North American Chinese food...
To any1 trying this recipe at home BEWARE. The amount of water they used for the batter way off. I made some with the posted 1 and one half cups and got what looked like bread dough. Added a whole nother cup of water and it still didnt have same consistency as whats in the video
Looks yum. Ta
Oh my god this is the best recipe i have ever tried in my life it s so delisssshhhhhhh
It is good with chicken legs and gizzard.
Yoooo i tried this and it didnt work
As a Chinese, panda express is my last choice among other fast food restaurants  (MacDonald  tacobell, Chipotle,burger king, chick-fil-a, pizza hut.....etc) Can't allow it called as Chinese food!! It's not Chinese food!!! It's panda food
好难吃
This is not Chinese food 😂😂
Watching this at midnight is a bad idea coz it really makes you hungry.  There's no Panda Express here in the Philippines but I'm definitely going to try this recipe :D
love the videos
I make it all the time
Too many steps and ingredients they did.. no wonder why its really dangerous to eat outside. People must know that they must cook simple not like this, too many oil and etc. Anyway thanks for the info. Weve been doing this all the time with simpler way ( a very simple way)
Orange chicken or General Tsao is actually American, not chinese
Amberlynn Reid entered the chat
Finally I found the best recipe!!
No wonder, I love your channel so much
Yeah you american ! just fat and sugar congratulation. Made in usa.
Have you ever heard of Potatoe Chicken? Where I used to live, there was a local chinese food place and they had this dish called Potatoe Chicken. It was super good!! But I have never seen that dish in other places. Panda Express didn't had that dish (also I rarely ate there) and other places didn't had it either. It looked like orange chicken but it wasn't sweet in taste. Maybe you can try making that dish if you happen to know of it.
You r so hungry. Try it first.  Is this tasty.Oh yea..Tasty... New friend  here.👍
Making me hungry
This is awesome Tasty! I have similar cooking channel to this, check it out guys! You wont regret it.
I just had Panda Express for the first time a few days ago & the orange chicken was super tasty.
Rubbage
I worked at Panda Express when I was a teenager and their orange chicken came prepackaged. The only thing they made fresh was the sauce.
Quem for do Brasil curte ae
I'm done in 2:20
Love it
Худший рецепт что я пробывал. Полное дно
Huummmm
taehyung liked this video
I made this. Best damn recipe... I mean it! So easy and came out so good
Forgot to clean the chicken 🤦🏻‍♂️
*Googles closest nearby Panda Express*
Damn Delicious Orange chicken is pretty good too. About the same. She puts green onions and zest from an orange in hers though. I have made this so many times though I only combine flour + cornstarch and then milk+ egg. Dunk in egg mixture then in cornstarch mixture. This is good if you like it crunchier. Mixing it all together makes it less crunchy I believe. ALso not adding egg mixture at all makes it less crunchy. Not an expert. Just messing lol. Vinegar seems to bring out the orange. Letting the garlic and ginger get aromatic for 1 minute also makes it better. Red pepper flakes are necessary even if it is not for noticeable heat. Amazing cooking is. =).
This is how many fat people (biggas) are in comment section
Wow, thats way too many ingredients and effort for a fried chicken. Feels not worth it.
Its prob cheaper to just order it from Panda Express lol
Why western people fry meat with sugar
But noone eat this in china.
I could never trust myself to make orange chicken and when I’m finished put a whole chicken piece in my mouth without cutting it open to see if it’s raw in the middle
Eeewww! Ewww!  Ewww!  Panda Express... Eeewwww!
FUCK CHAIN RESTAURANTS. THEY PUT FILLER INTO THEIR FOOD TO MAKE IT CHEAP TO MAKE, AND ITS JUST MAKING YOU FATTER AND FATTER AMERICA
Why do you keep all that fat in the chicken thighs ?
I never had the orange chicken in China
Yeah "yeet"
Theres plenty of processed chinese food especially in england don't know if they treat their own like the rest but i've had some terrible food
TAEHyung to Jin : MOM MAKE THIS NOW
Thanks a alot. Now I'm hungry!
So I tried this recipe tonight and it tastes nothing like Panda Express, I did forget the sesame oil at the end so maybe that is why it wasn't that great IDK 😒
This is literally just Chicken Chilly. I wonder which was invented first. Edit: Nelson Wang invented it in 1975.
Sorry to burst your bubble panda but all your food is processed ive worked there and its all garbage so dont sit there and lie about the food
My brother got sick from eating Panda Express, so I’m glad that I found this video! Now we can make it at home, knowing it’s much healthier for us.
BTS, i’m thinking of you
This dish reminded me of Sheldon Cooper.
When was the orange used?
when you hate soy sauce but your favorite panda express chicken had soy sauce
2:47 tells us how good the chicken is
suger everywhere.. fuckin hate suger..
The aroma of the orange chicken has to burn your nose a bit due to the acetic acid. Thats when u know u made panda express orange chicken.
Authentic Chinese food. Lol 😂
Do they eat pandas in panda express?
Could you pronounce acidity again?
My sister made it. And, surprisingly it was yummy!  I wasn't expecting it to be that good. But, the sweet flavour of orange and the saltiness from soyasauce made it perfect.
Oh God salt and pepper, PLEASE LISTEN TO US AND USE OTHER SEASONINGS TOO PLEASE PLEASE JUST DO IT YOU MAKE ME CRINGE PLEASE JUST DO IT I BEG OF YOU
Big chow is better.
Panda Express does not look like this
🤤🤤🤤🤤
Where the hell is the orange!?? I've been living a lie..
When u add brown sugar or sugar in non veg.. it's gone... Non veg should be spicy
Amberlyn has joined the chat....
You add brown sugar?...😱
When l saw Panda Express what immediately came to my mind was Taehyung😍
Now I want it
They dont even serve Panda tbh. 👎
Tastes awfull
Sugar - Brown Sugar - Orange Juice  (~ 32g of sugar).. That’s some sweet chicken
I wish I was a better cook
I dont like all the sugar and corn starch.
Ha! $80 in side ingredients just to get started.
Looks like I’ll be buying chicken thighs and orange juice tomorrow. 😂
No orange of anything added. So why is it called orange chicken?🤔
Nice
Nice
Or you can just go to Panda Express and not do this?
Why's hes cooking on the floor, though?
Tso good, oh wait wrong food.
Too much sugar lol
Where the orange at  in orange chicken?
ترجمة لو سمحتوا
Not authentically chinese tho
KᏆᎷ ᎢᎪᎬᎻYᏌNᏩ ᎻᎪᏚ ᎬNᎢᎬᎡᎬᎠ ᎢᎻᎬ ᏟᎻᎪᎢ
Anybody else watching this knowing full well they don't have the ingredients for this and even if they did, they cannot be arsed to do it?
Why orange 😭😞
This chicken looks amazing . Unfortunately Panda Express doesn’t make they’re orange chicken fresh and is nothing like this at all once so ever .
Awesome now I can be sure I’m not eating dog meat !!!
an my the only who ignored the commentary the whole time
So it IS chicken... Or is this just the ideal situation
Am I the only one who lost interest once he added white sugar brown sugar and juice
I can imagine Taehyung watching this right now...Lmao..Hello Tae!
who is watching while high
Nice
“With Chinese there is no way to cheat it”  Ask the poor cats that they claim is “chicken”
*Me: Watching how to make Chinese foods*  *My dog : Starts sweating*
Save all the trouble and just buy the sauce premade from Panda
Panda express sucks now. Its use to be good for your buck, and fast food.
Wow ! So delicious
Anyone else love the feeling of going to the food court at your local mall and getting Chinese food and when u ask for a type of chicken or meat they always make sure to give you the least amount possible bc asians are cheap ?
Oh he is so full of shit ,😂 I worked at a panda and the orange chicken is not made the way it is made here , the orange chicken comes pre packaged and ready to fry and the orange chicken sauce is made from loads corn starch , fuckton of vinegar and orange extract
Thank you panda express orange chicken man. you really are our guardian angel.
No they are not, and they don't make it that way at panda. Panda is not the orginal makers of that chicken
Panda Express is not real Chinese food
😁😁😁
Just get chicken and squeeze an orange. Boom.
Sugar ruined everything 😥😥
My dumbass thought it was some orange juice wet rub
Panda Express is a insult to Chinese Food.
Made this again today and the results were as perfect as the final shot in the video. 1000 thanks Panda and Tasty.
As a Singaporean I can confirm that orange chicken is the stuff of gastronomic nightmares.
Hate to burst the bubble here but the orange chicken is not made this way at panda, and they can and do cheat traditional Chinese cooking. The chicken they use for orange chicken has the taste and texture of McDonald’s chicken nuggets. I had a serving of it once with minimal sauce for whatever reason and I could easily tell. The sauce is mass produced as well.   Recipe is great tho lol
Omg, this so damn good! Just made it and it's delicious, my entire family loved it! Thanks
Great recipe, gotta put a dislike here though, How does this guy allow this video to get released into the wild and be ok with that water amount? That would bug the hell out of me if I were him.
I really wanna make this but I don't have the  Cornstarch Vinegar Sesame oil White black pepper Salt All purpose flour Chicken  Or the  Pot
I've worked at panda Express for over a year and I can say with absolute certainty that this isn't even close to how we make it. And the part about the food not being processed is an absolute lie lol
The grey shirt  guy from chinese people trying panda express wouldve said this is how america fools people with chinese food orange chicken is authentic 😂
When you say orange juice do u need freshly squeazed or like store bought
Looks soo fucking good. Makes my crappy sandwich look like shit.
100g of sugar in that chicken
Don’t know why I searched this up, knowing that I’m not going to make it
Just made it. Tastes amazing. Thanks Tasty!
How how would we know if orange chicken is really made with chicken and not rat meat or dog meat ???
Where are all the Amberlynn Reid comments?
When panda express is closed and you have all the necessary ingredients on hand to make this yourself....the feels ^_^
👌
I really wanted him to use a chop stick at the end
2:43 why is chewing that small piece of chicken like he had another 10 pieces in his mouth already
Can someone please tell me if this tastes good or not? I haven’t made it yet I just want to know.
I can watch this all day
i can’t be the only one who has straight diarrhea after eating panda express
Just made this recipe. Took about 2 hours altogether. Prepping ingredients, frying, etc. Worth it tho!
I dont get Subscribers . I work so hard on my videos 🙁https://youtu.be/99-CsQEzvfY
it’s to sweet i didn’t like the taste i just tried it today and i did everything as described
you know that somewhere my bias Taehyung has seen this video
Sooo...I literally just ordered Orange Chicken at a Asian Restaurant and this video "coincidentally" popped up on my feed..."the powers that Be...are Listening" lol
We mjinga
THIS IS SWEET N SOUR BUT WITHOUT THE PINEAPPLE
People in the comments are aware this is American Chinese food, and not at all authentic Chinese food? Most Chinese people haven’t heard of this unless they have lived in America.
I did it but for some reason they look like dumplings lmao the taste is pretty nice tho
Wow this did not come out right at all???
I substituted the deep fried chicken with big popcorn chicken, it works. For anyone short on time I suggest this.
This food certainly isn’t this fresh in the restaurant!
I love orange chicken
Orange chicken has been around longer than 87 tho🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I made this for my family and they were all amazed! It tasted super good!!! Thanks for the recipe.
Ouuu 😃😃😃🤣🤣🤣
Don’t use the sesame oil it makes it taste like medicine.
I deadass was about to order some on Postmates today. It’s like crack to me, or at least how I think it is to be on crack 💀
I now really want Panda Express
you know how fast i clicked on this video 😂
I recreated this on my channel it turned out better than I thought 😂
Yeah, your batter recipe is not even close on the liquid. Basically makes a dough unless you up the water. The end product is ok but this is not the same as Orange Chicken from Panda.
What oil did he use to fry the chicken
Is there a way to make this a bit spicier, because red pepper flakes doesn't do it for me anymore, so i want to kick it up a notch
The batter keeps falling off of mine once I put it in to boil, any idea what I'm doing wrong?

I went out of my way to shop for these items just so I could make this recipe and I wish I never did . It tastes soooooooooooo bad and smells like a rotten sock not even kidding :::::(((((((
Wow

Orange Sugar Chicken
Fake Chinese cuisine
I know its not healthy but I'm addicted to panda express lol. Good thing I'm always broke
So chinese cuisine is the only one that needs precision and technique. The other cuisines "cheat". Okay.
Panda Express needs to put their orange chicken in the frozen food section. Every other orange chicken actually tastes like fuckin oranges and it makes me mad😭😭
I sadly have to skip the Red Pepper flakes and Black Pepper but should it still turn out good ?
U just made me hungry
Mmm kinda tastes like chicken
It’s good I tried it
just made it.  i failed.
Sorry to ruin it... but this is fake Chinese food. I am Chinese btw
you mean the devil's chicken?🤢
the fact that this isn't a complicated food to make is so nice to be honest i was just waiting for them to pull out some random super Chinese ingredient i haven't heard of and wouldnt know where to get
finna make this i'll update y'all
I don't know why i remembered Kim taehyung 😂❤️❤️
Made this and it tastes amazing. I double some of the sauce ingredients so it could coat all of the chicken pieces.
I love Orange Chicken
I really like when they had the Mandarin Chicken. Idk why they stopped carrying it. Now I just stick to the orange chicken.
Some orange chicken on a bed of their noodles, ooh it’s over. Dam I’m hungry 😋
I LOVE THE ORANGE CHICKEN FROM THIS PLACE 😍❤️
I got food poisoning from Panda Express. I can’t go back.
Orange chicken is the best
2:48 I didn’t know Brazilian Ronaldo was Chinese
thank you jimmy W A N G
Is he rapping??
Cynthia 😊,  who I met in ROSA RITO, informed me of z best CHINESE food found in  Mexicali
I just cooked this & it's a success 👌🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Orange chicken is so delicious
Use less sesame oil bc it took all over the dish
Yum
Panda Express sucks. Anyone else agree?
What about them hole in the wall Chinese places? With orange chicken the size of a marble
I’m veganizing this recipe.
Awesome will b making this👍👍😁
There's no actually orange in it
I eat mostly vegan, but this looks delicious!!!!
I want some but don't want to eat fried food :(
At the beginning i wasn't listening and i thought he said "my name is Chicken Wang"
hits home?
Sorry, Panda Express DID NOT invent Orange Chicken.... We had it in the early 1970's at Golden Dragon in Tyson's Corner, Virginia.
"start with fresh chicken" well you are already not aligned with the original panda Express..
Waaaaack!!!
Why does he keep saying Chinese food?
Fantastic !!! Thank you for this
Eating McDonald's while watching this
I know 80% people here are army🗿
Who is the guy at the end? 😂😂😂😂
OMG I AM SO HUNGRY NOW
Mine chicken came out super crunchy but when I put it in the sauce it becomes soft. Is there anyway to keep that super Crispy crunchy after you put sauce ?
why am i watching this at 3 am hungry af.
I work at Panda Express
u can’t convince me they doing all this at panda 💀
My brother worked there once but everything they have maybe not the fortune cookies or like stuff like that the actual food and not the drinks they add sesame oil or seeds and my mom is DEATHLY allergic so I’m kinda happy my brother worked there for a bit but can you make more and Ik u added in the sesame oil but if you don’t add it dose It make a difference
Nobody:     Me at 2AM:
Ok but he ate it with a fork
Because taehyung loves *Panda express*
If this is the recipe then why did i see them open a fresh bag of frozen chicken at my panda express
So much suger!!!! O NO, I Will not.eat at panda express anymore :c
my eyes burn
I thought this was HowToBasic
quick question: is the soy sauce the japanese type or the chinese type with heavier sweeter consistency?
i just to work for panda express has a fob and latter also work in the BOH area and almost all the food is on a freeze and some employess on my store where so nasty they some times wanted to serve old chicken
I don't like orange chicken and never had p express. Why am I here
I thought this was HowToBasic
Taehyung has entered the chat.
We all know panda express makes crunchy ass chow mein and soggy ass orange chicken. No matter how fresh I got something, it always turned out to be the opposite of what it's supposed to be. Smh. Quality really went down. I remember they used to be really good. Now they're meh.
Panda express in mississippi is absolutely terrible
This really ain’t how they make the orange chicken at panda. The recipe is different and the chicken come ready to fry so we just throw it in. It’s the easiest thing to make at panda.
I need this guy to come to my house and prepare this for me like right now
i want it
Sorry, been to Panda Express. Never again.
Trader Joe's has a nice frozen orange chimken
Panda Express isn’t even good and there food isn’t even good either it’s not even actual Chinese food
Uses a fork to eat it...
LOL so much sugar.. no wonder ppl like it.
2:25 “a toast of nuttiness”
That looks soooo good!!!!
I’ve never been to Panda Express. Is it nice?
Flour, white sugar, brown sugar... yeap...! Tastes delicious indeed but holly molly... Plus rice? LMAO
Remember when the orange chicken was spicy? Shit was good
looks gooooooooood mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
The chicken at the restaurant is already cooked and breaded and then deep fried all their doing is frying it again with the sauce.
My favorite Panda Express item is the Honey Walnut Shrimp. 🍯🥜🦐🍤 It's so @#$%king delicious! But the orange chicken is also pretty tasty too.🍊🐓🍗
CHEF WANG WHATS UP HOT STUFF!!!!!!!
Did anyone came here Cause kim taehyung? Oh just me lol
Hi! My name is Rilum Osmanaj. Peace.
Saamin ang west philippine sea
Fuck I’m hungry😂
I think Chinese may be my least favourite Asian cuisine but damn that looks good.
It isn’t actually chinese food. It’s American-chinese food.
Great recipe, and totally agree on using chicken thighs....but doesn’t Panda Express actually use chicken breast ?
I have everything except the chicken. WHY WHY WHY
1:38 虽然我英语不好但是中菜不应该是适量适量适量吗XD
Someone make it and let me know if it tastes good
You use way more chicken than Panda does... All I ever get is fried batter...
Sweet or salty , soy sauce ?
I thought Panda Express was panda meat guess I was wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️
Guy: Use fresh Chicken Every Chicken place: *Sweating Intensifies*
Okay I actually work at panda express and this recipe is almost exactly IDENTICAL to our actual receipe. Like are you psychic or how did you know how we cook this???? The only major difference I can point out is that we use orange extract not orange juice. Incredible!!!
Tmobile!
Taehyung: OoH, I LoVE pANdA  eXpREsS   Me: * with tae’s food *  Hold on honey, I’m swimming to Korea right now
1.8k real Chinese ppl disliked this video.
Lol that’s not food.....fruit and vegetables are....HEY, IM NOT VEGAN
Ive read gordon ramsey
it ain't Chinese food🙂
wtf!! this is so easy! could make this with things i already have in the pantry. love it.
I misread and thought that this food was made out of panda's meat and I was about to rage the hell out of stupidity.
So for orange juice does he mean freshly squeezed or Sunny D?😭
my panda express looks like the depressing cousin of this panda express.
Do they really use wet batter? Because I saw another video of people eating PE, the chicken looked like coated with dry batter. Never ate orange chicken myself because we have no Panda Express here, but really interested to try.
So ur telling me there’s no oranges in orange chicken
Legacy Rust chicken
How to make epic orange chicken,  *buy popcorn chicken and marinate it in orange juice then deep fry it*
i just ate some panda express 💀 while watching this
I thought it said cooking the founder of Panda Express 😂😂😂
This is an absolute blessing! thanks
I worked for Panda Express between 88-90. I saw how orange chicken was made, and this recipe is NOT correct.
Thought this was how to basic
I work at Panda Express 😊
cant wait to try it
When I see a plate of orange chicken I think… dam someone’s really gonna miss their cat
That's gweilo food 🤢
Is it me or does the fried rice at Panda Express taste bland and dry?
Yummmmmmmmm
I honestly only clicked on this video because it looked good
this is good , i tried
I haven't watched food videos for months and the day after i order orange chicken for the first time i get recommended this video. That being said. Thanks for the recommendation algorithm.
you guys know that Chinese people don't go to Panda Express and there is no orange chicken in China, right?
can vinegar n orange be replaced with lemon?
Panda Express sucks
Well i dont have to go to a restaurant for this now that i know ? Looks delicious
Somebody call ALR
I’m just eating it while I’m watching them making it?
When it comes to Chinese food there is no way to cheat it. * Thinks about MSG*    ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
Can I use chicken breast
Ok but is it cheaper?
is there any fit recipe for the same?
It's not real panda
Yo tasty. Gaming saturday? <3 bye
All that sugar os just gross
I never got to Panda Express. Waste of money when other local eateries are better for cheaper
Panda express in FIU is deffenitly cooked like that lol All I taste is vinager
Too much sesame
lmfao     Americans and their POV of/from "authentic food".
I feel like hearing some 90s hiphop
Haha, Wang.
Why don't  you teach some real Chinese food with your food skills.  LoL
This is not Chinese food.
Que es cornstarch? Si me pudieran responder por favor
美食
Has any body tried this recipe?
*Kim Taehyung has entered the chat*
Jimmy, do you always cut raw chicken on a wooden board?
It's almost correct cause I used to work in panda Express its actually lemon juice but no brown sugar
V:  I love panda express ohhh Rm: we have panda express in korea too
I thought he would eat that with chopsticks, you know
Oh look, fake Chinese food!
I've been waiting for this for so long😍
So where‘s the orange??
I'm asian , and im going to try this
Omg I been craving Chinese food for the past 3 days now and I see this .-.
Bullshit
Can i make this with almond flour instead of normal flour
Basically down here in South India this is called a Chilli Chicken minus the curry.
Wow, cool! No MSG!!! That means I can go to Panda Express and order this. Can't wait!! :D
My theory was RIGHT. They do use orange juice
just made this recipe for myself, I added extra water to the batter but forgot the eggs and oil SMH still turned out nice and crisp but now my kitchen's an oily mess and I'm nursing a few new burns
I've had some and they added orange peels to it ..whut.?
Pretty interesting. However it’s different in the store. For one thing, we don’t add vinager. Or orange juice. It’s orange extract in alcohol. Also, the orange chicken comes frozen and pre-breaded. We fry them for 8 minutes. So there is some processing involved. It is dark meat chicken thighs though. And we add the chili flakes, and also the ginger-garlic. Those two come in mixed together pre-made.
Okay now do walnut shrimp.
It would be cheaper to just buy it at panda Express. I bet them clear glass bowls, cooking pans, and that single stove thing ain't no joke. But thanks anyways lucky for me my city got three  Panda E's. If you have Wall Mart market there's gonna be a  Panda Express close by.
Sugar chicken? It’s pretty much all they have
Tht looks so good
I had this before and it was so dry idk why but it was bad
damn that lookin real good
Has anyone else gotten food poisoning from the orange chicken and fried rice?
Fake. Panda Express chicken has a really hot spice on it that makes it unedible. This video featured no such spice.
😵see no evil
Looks like chicken Manchurian made with bit of orange juice
Fuck this im so hungry nothing to eat help me god
love me some fake chinese food
My mouth is watering, I want to make this!
when I saw him he reminded me of michelle khare
Now to make this Ketofied!
Thats cool you used real chicken thighs at the panda near my house   i feel like they use chicken necks or something
That does it I'm diving to Panda Express for dinner tonight.
Made this with chicken breast turned out freaking awesome.
Looks delicious, TO BAD they can NEVER fix it like the way it look's in this video
I order those most of the time when I get the chance. Sad how Chinese food does better than other restaurants that are American, IN America.
Implying Panda Express is good
Nigguhs will go crazy over this dish
Taehyung: I lOvE pAnDa ExPrEsS! oOoHh!
Looks great!
Diabetes and heart disease here I come.
Yeeeeessssssssss orange chicken!!!!
Sugar chicken
You're better off, by eye-balling everything from what you see. The amounts in the video are weird.
How about forget the batter and just fry chicken in sesame oil and then add the sauce... then you don't have to eat all that SHIT!
it’s 3:30 am and i’m soooooo hungry
It's such trash and the rice is so bland and sad
Advise to Wang. The rice at Panda Express is low quality and never cooked fully.The vegetables are raw 90 percent of the time. The beef at your restaurants is low grade and tough with no flavor. Your food lacks understanding of proper spices and ingredients. Really needs to improve.
I want to inhale that plate
*Amberlynn Reid has entered the chat*
Hey Google Where's the closest panda express
Chinese food is technical???!?? I would say the greatest chef never calculate exact amount of ingredients nor timing, they improvise, they go by their feelings
Dammit, I tried my experiment after this video but burnt the chicken.
we don't really eat orange chicken in China
Me: I’m going to eat healthy Sees this video  Also me: Dam you tasty
Just so you guys know... Panda Express chicken comes in frozen and they thaw it out in a container.... worked at panda for a week before I quit lol. Every meat is frozen and thawed out (I’m just saying cause the video shows fresh cut chicken breasts ;/  )
They changed the rice so bad i won't go there. Its fucking disgusting and taste like onions
This was a MUCH easier recipe than I thought it was! I can make this ANYTIME!
I clocked it... Taste blunt
Panda is fucking nasty
fresh chicken?
Im mexican and my two favorite foods are mexican and Chinese.
Couple tips: When frying in batches, keep the chicken that's been fried in a warm oven, so it doesn't get cold while you are frying the rest. Maybe ~150F. I wish I did this. Unless you like your chicken super sweet, tone down the sugar suggested for the glaze.
if your chicken is orange, don't walk, run!
You forgot to add the MSG
Looks awesome 🤤 I'm hungry now can I have some please 🤲😋
How about sweet and sour chicken from panda express???
Panda Express is the worst Chinese food I’ve ever tasted. I can make better Chinese food better than that
i've never understood sweet food...  well ofc stuff like waffles works but i mean stuff like meat.. i've had stuff people claim is amazing but is glazed with some sweet stuff and god its horrible.. so all this sugar makes me confident that this would taste pretty bad for me :|
This is not Chinese food.
amberlynn be quaking
This video pissed me off I'm hungry and broke
Panda Express is gross
I can taste that bite
shit load of oil shit load sugar glad i saw this so i dont have this again.
Blood pressure and diabetes in one meal lol
I thought this is imthebasic so i double guess thanks god it's tasty
Too much work, I'll just go to Panda Express.
My fav............ Salivating
This is why i call it sugar meat
My young heart broke a little when I first heard the Mandarin Chicken was removed. Used to get Orange Chicken, Mandarin Chicken, and Steamed White Rice. Beautiful lil’ combo back then. I dunno now. Nothing hits the same, and now I’m looking to save up enough to trace the Food Ranger’s steps in China...
Vegans may be angry right now
3 minutes and no useless stuffing. Thank you sir.
Time to make a halal version of this. I love South East Asian cuisine!!
Oh and don't forget the MSG that makes my stomach go through 5 layers of hell before I dry heave all night. Yeah don't forget that shit.....
Panda Express was the originator of orange chicken?... why do I doubt this
That ugly meat
I really need to try orange chicken looks amazing.i always tend to go for lemon so need to give it a go.Great video looks great
yummy
q rico boludo, lo único que soy vegetariano :v
That shit be frozen then they fry it then they coat the chicken after it’s fried in the sugary orange chicken sauce
*_i HavEn'T hAd PaNdA eXpReSs In 4 YeArs yEt mY pApA nEvEr sAiD aNyThInG aBoUt oRaNgE cHiCkEn????????? WHAT??????_*
I don’t really fuck with shit when we westernize it too much, but orange chicken is a guilty pleasure.
I'm gonna do it tomorrow. I mean today hahaha.  Is 4:02am.  Whyyyyyyyyy can't I sleep 😭
Orange chicken is Chinese food?
Panda Express is disgusting
Now we just need the Kung Pao and the string bean
I ate my phone
Honestly panda express is overrated Pay $6 to $8 for an amount of food that makes tv dinners look like a feast
The funny thing is, is that they pretty much just exposed them selves for not using fresh chicken or even chicken because what they serve at Panda Express looks nothing like that
I’m on keto and I’m binge watching tasty vids wtf
I have eaten Panda Express one time.  That is all I will ever need.
They lying bruh. The orange chicken is frozen and packaged at Panda.
Does anyone know bts?  Taehyung AKA V will love this video because he love love love like love panda express!
Now I want Panda Express at 1 am...
She orange chicken at panda never look that good, that shit generally dry overcooked bland or burnt
*_Taehyung has entered the chat_*
I would add a little orange zest to enhanced the aroma
Why are there 1.7k dislikes? How is there even one person who would dislike this video?
With Chinese food there is no way to cheat it? Huh?????? You mean like every cheap takeout place that uses sauce that comes in big plastic containers? I guess thats Chinese traditional cooking then.
Man, I'm so hungry right now.
Bourbon chicken next please...
No panda Express has this. Its all garbage and not fresh. I worked there
someone show this video to taehyung 💜
this doesn’t work don’t use this recipe
No esa no es la reseta del panda 🐼 yo si me la se es más sensilla
I wish i could make food like that... or that Panda Express was in my country...
I wish i could make food like that... or that Panda Express was in my country...
I prefer the Sweetfire Chicken but the the orange chicken is good too
Is it possible to use an air fryer for this? Not really comfortable with frying in oil. I know it won't taste the same, but it's still closer than no orange chicken, and I really miss it (There isn't any american chinease takeaway where I live).
2:46 you aren't a real chinese, eating with a fork...
THANK YOU! I just made this perfect on the first try! It tastes great. I cant believe it
改良版的锅包肉😂😂😂
No way YouTube algorithm was reading my mind
im sure it tastes nice but it looked soggy
Ha, wang
Deadly greasily Chinese food that could kill you.
I think I am 3 things 1.The only child watching this 2. The only person makeing this 3.The only child makeing this instead of playing in a pool during summer lol
(Sugar enough to make a 1.5 kg cake
Why'd this dude use a fork
Like like like like like
Looks great and all. But it's probably just easier to go down to the mall food court and grab some.
That’s my favorite food in the entire world!!😋😋😋😋😋😋
Ok, are you still hanging on to your water fasting still?
Finally I been asking for orange chicken for weeks lol
The grandpa who speaks Cantonese was da real mvp lol He keeps saying "good job" which is cute 😂😂😂
Is this general tao?
This is absolutely now Chinese receipt. This is calorie bomb.
How much is 1 inch and 1 1/2 cups in normal people English
Looks easy to make, will try it!
There is no sesame oil in the original orange chicken
Panda Express is basically overpriced garbage, at the least the one I went to anyway
Is he cooking on the floor? Lol my floor looks like that so i was just wondering xD
Tried to fry it in "badges" as the asian guy said, but it was a miserable failure. Then I tried frying it in BATCHES, and it worked. He should have said batches, not badges.
At Least It’s Not Duck!
Hell yeah I love Chinese food
As a native born Chinese my first taste of General Tso’s chicken and Mongolian beef was both in US😂
Wow it's kinda simple
With a name like Jimmy Wang, you know this guy's legit.
Frying part is awesome... until later ruined by overly sweetened sauce.
Now I really dont have to leave my house for this
Am I weird for liking orange chicken better when the meat inside is on the drier side?
Hideously unhealthy food. Loads of refined bleached carbs and a ton of sugar. Also lol at saying Chinese food is technical...
can u do a video where he does it all in chinese?
Yeah because I have a deep fryer at home
I thought this was howtobasic 😔
OMG Ownage
You know who could use this recipe? Panda Express because what they serve is depressing
That's american "chinese food". Way too sweet and oily for real Chinese food.
Last time I ate Panda Express orange chicken I got really bad food poisoning and got like 2 hours of sleep xd
Yuck
U cant cheat chinese food? Ever heard of MSG???? That comment u made gave u a dislike
Too bad Panda Express is pure trash
Ever thing on your menu tastes the same i know I’m late but you and I both know it’s true
nice voice
Except everything in Panda Express is frozen and they just warm it up in the woks at the restaurant
I'll have the dry ass fried rice with two sides of sugar chicken, please!
WUTTT? HE NO USE CHOPSTICK???
Right food for diet
Nobody: Nobody: Nobody: Nobody: Nobody: Nobody: Nobody: Nobody: Tasty: O r A n G e  C h I c K e N
Uh oh everyone knows the secret recipe now
Clean the f chicken
Love Panda meat
I worked at panda, the chicken is all frozen
I could eat that every night with a bunch of rice and broccoli and I wouldn't give a shit!
Then why the fuck doesnt it look like chicken when i order it
*N U T*
"In Chinese food you can't fake it" Yeah, sure...
Panda Express in El Salvador sucks
He doesn't even cut the fat off!
1/2 cap of pure sugar...+ ~1 cap of sugar eq~ from cornstarch&flour yes we are sugar adicts...welcome to group everyone =)
My favorite Chinese place. Now even more since seeing this video. And I'm going to attemtp to make it. One day.
I had to think for a sec when he said AP flour
Please don't like this comment🤚
panda express food is not edible not tasty and makes me PUKE
I do love me some orange chicken.  Too bad panda is disgusting
Bruh we eat this at school, shits delicious
I love orange chicken but I've never had crispy orange chicken from any chinese restaurant ever. Either frompanda express or an actual dine in chinese restaurant. Always came out more soggy. Until I did same thing with beer batter and followed the rewt
Everytime I go to Panda, I either get noodles or God's beautiful creation, everything else is nice. I was actually planning to make orange chicken do I'm gonna try this and run over to Panda to pick up one of theirs and see if they taste alike
The amount of sugar which is added is way too much ! You can use a tea spoon of white& brown sugar ! Sometimes the orange it self is sweet !
Making this tonight
So I made this but the problem i encountered was that when i fried the chicken it kept getting stuck to itself or the bottom of the pan
A single cube of chicken there like exceeds the recommended daily salt intake...
I needed this video, wow
Poor chickens
This is my second favorite food after dumplings
Me: Nobody: YouTube when I wake up: Here’s how to make orange chicken!       BTW , the orange chicken flavor from panda isn’t even real orange it’s just food flavoring. Wack
Is it just me or does it look like he’s cooking on the floor
This looks so good on😋😋😋☺️
My mouth is watering at the sight.
F*ck sake.  Do not watch right before bed
Oh it’s my work
is it really 2 tablespoons of oil? 2 teaspoons would sound more realistic.
I got food poisoning from this exact dish at a Panda Express
It never looks as good as it looks in these videos and the taste its far from what it shud be 😐 And im not a crap cook at all...
Orange chicken tastes nasty
😋👌🏻👍🏻
I ruv olange chicken.
I can't think about orange chicken without thinking of Amberlynn Reid lol
That looks so good 😍
I never liked the orange chicken...    *i really want orange chicken now*
Amberlynns favorite lol
"PANDAA EXPRESSSSS YEAHHHHH"- BTS
General tso
I kept the sauce seperate so the chicken stay crunchy
This dish looks like an indian chicken crispy !
Whole else clicked on this didn’t see the channel name and thought it was how to basic?
I have to make it.
Former Panda employee here, while I can't divulge how they make the orange sauce in the restaurants because you sign an NDA, I can say that there is a lot more effort put into this homemade variety and the sauce in the stores is way grosser. Like seriously, don't eat it.
🤤😍
Someone let Karl Pilkington know
dat is really good my friends, forget the KARTOFFELN.
I'm making this because V likes Panda Express😂😂😂  #BTSARMY 💜  Any ARMY out there?
Can u use chicken breast in this too?
Mmmmm🤤🤤🤤🤤
What about the healthy version of this; less sugar maybe
Ok not to be rude or anything but there noodles are complete shit, they are too skinny and hard. Please fix that
How much is 1 cup ?
I’m not saying that Panda Express is an amazing Chinese restaurant or anything but I’d eat that orange chicken every day if my heart could take it
this chicken more saucy then the senfeild bass vid
Panda Express orange chicken is nasty but this looks good
I've made a similar recipe half a dozen times. Only thing I do different is I use 1/4  cup of fresh squeezed orange joice AND the zest of half that orange. The zest makes all the difference! Oh also I use a few splashes of sake in the sauce, then use the rest of the orange to make a cocktail.
Thats sexy
I’m going to do it, wish me luck
Can I use rice flour
Came here faster than a beanbag in a hurry.
Most Chinese food is unhealthy. Soy sauce, oysters sauce , so much sugars and oil. Indian food is way much the healthier with all natural ingredient
I looove thier orange chicken. I'm a real regular at Panda.
I aways use Sunny D instead of regular orange juice. It gives it somthing special to the dish.
...lol, I just buy the bottled orange sauce at Panda... but a scratch sauce recipe is nice to have in the arsenal.😊
OVERRATED
And mine probably still won’t taste as good, I’m going to try this... I loveeeee Panda Express!!!
I’m a professional cook, I make dishes for people at restaurants, birthday cakes, etc.   I have tried this recipe and I can approve that it tastes exactly like Panda Express although it’s a little crispy that’s it
ugh. the best
I feel like if I make this at home it’s not going to taste like Panda’s
Bs I worked at panda and the chicken was never fresh. Try frozen in the freezer for a week in the back in a box and who knows where that box came from lol.
But we don’t actually do this step by step everything we used is pre made in packs shocker right..
I want to make this with a plant-based alternative. What would tasty recommended?
I would love to know the recipe of chicken chilli dry
How to make sugar chicken 😩
Why is he cooking on the floor
he ate the chicken with a fork i’m so offended
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS RECIPE on Google for a LONG time.
Hey it's easy.      Just color the chicken with orange paint.
**amberlynn has entered the chat**
The original orange chicken sucks. I worked at Panda around 1997 when they made the transition to the boxed frozen orange chicken which was so much better and is the hit that it has become today!
I'm going to make this. The only orange chicken I ate was on chowking restaurant and kinda want one that is home made 😅
Ugh.. chicken fat has really disgusting taste.. remove it before.. jheez.
Garnish it with sesame seeds
Food poisoning
P.E is my favorite restaurant
Looks scrumptious
Maybe with tofu, cauliflower...broccoli? Oohh Button mushrooms!!!
I just ate and this made me hungry
I don't like dark meat.
Panda express sells orange chicken Rocks. And Lo Mein is a no go. Never get that. Fried rice all day!
I fee like if i did everything the same as his it wouldnt turn out the same
How much is a cup? I'm from Germany,  so I need milli-liter
i just got my wisdom teeth out so i cant even fu king eat anything
Thank you so much
what is AP flour?
Hang on.. Why does this asian guy sound just like the original tasty video guy?
I LOVE orange chicken!!!! 😍😍
I'm surprised they didnt dredge the chicken in flour prior to putting it in the batter.
Fuck me now I gotta go buy some orange chicken cuz I cant cook this quick enough
But is it made outta 🐈 and 🐕???
I phoned a local Chinese food place, asked specifically if they sold orange chicken, the kind with the orange syrup sauce, the dude had a thick accent so I made sure he knew exactly what I was talking about as I had already been in the phone with 3 other restaurants, dude confirms it is the orange fried chicken with the orange syrupy sauce they buy from the store. When it got to my house it was in a styrofoam cup, I opened it and it was filled with chicken broth, little pieces of chicken like what you put in a soup, slices of an actual orange and a whole green prepper sliced up and Jammed In there. I called and complained and I got the notorious " no substitution" that cost me $20 dollars for a cup of bullshit, I haven't ordered orange chicken since, as I live in Canada and there is no panda Express  DX I SINCERELY THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE !!!
And my diet plans just went out the window
The chicken in the restaurant already comes battered and frozen
Panda Express ruining Chinese food for decades.
Eating Chinese Food with a fork is a Warcrime
As a Chinese, I have never eaten orange chicken lol
Where was the orange in the recipe?
I went to a restaurant where they have actual orange peelings (very thin) and OMG 🤤🤤🤤 the best I ever had!
OMG 😍😍😍😍
I’ve witnessed panda grab frozen breaded chicken and put it in the fryer.
Sees this and attempts to cook it...........starts the car and drives to Panda Express
That is one scary sharp knife, weww. Go and sharpen it out. For your ease of cut and safety.
Panda Express to Chinese food as Taco Bell to Mexican food
Kim Taehyung: I love PaNdA Express!!!!!!🤩🤩 Me : impatiently running towards panda Express...🤩🤩
i will try with tofu
This is not Chinese food.
Gonna save this video and then never use it
I work here. We use frozen food
Does Panda Express use any peanut products in there foods?
Ok so I have made this before but with a different recipe and I have to say it is pretty good texture and everything is very similar to panda express. I did not use regular vinegar I used apple cider vinegar, and although I did fried my chicken, when I added the sauce I baked it instead that gives the chicken a much less crunchy feeling. If I find the recipe I will link it. :) https://pin.it/j4azd4bznkggdj
My niece and I tried this recipe today for my parents, and we all loved it. 5⭐️ THANKS !
You make this look so easy....awesome job, the biggest tip for people trying this at home is preparing everything before you start cooking.
I've never tried panda Express. Orange chicken is good alone without rice but I wouldn't usually have it.
So actually no orange in orange chicken more like fried sugar chicken!
Thank you for sharing awesome video :)
Gonna make this tonight!
This is Beautiful
Lost me at thigh meat I only eat white meant
I eat this danm near once a week...its down the street from me
You can't actually cheat a chinese dish...  I remember that time when I was still working as a cook in a chinese  restaurant and we actually cheat like making all the sauces including of course orange sauce for orange chicken. It's cheating tho it still authentic.
Thank you for using ACTUAL chicken.
Can you make it without orange ?
Yeee 🙌🏼
How many grams or milliliters ist a cup?
now i REALLY want orange chicken
Worst video ever
I want those ceramic take out cartons
Wow😍
YES! finally.... I made once following a famous youtuber chef and it was horrible.  I love panda Express orange chicken!
i love panda express orange chicken i buy it everyday
Just buy the panda express sause at Wal-Mart or in stores
Someone send this to young don the sauce god 🤣
pwede naman tong ulam diba? nice, wala na kaming ulam e.
Can almond flour work?
If u go in there alot like me they freeze there orange chicken so f*ck there “fresh chicken”
*kim taehyung has entered the chat*
First you want to get quallity meat You to the animal shelter
I was in the US for 2 weeks and returned to home some days ago. Honestly this Orange Chicken was the worst thing I've ever ate in my life at Panda Express. So nooo thanks I would rather eat raw nail polish instead of orange chicken.
too much batter
That look's AMAZING!
Ok, gonna do this with some tofu because, well, VEGETARIAN DUMB ASS I AM. but I'm actually proud to be a member of that sect hehehe
Can I change the cornstarch for just flour?
Hungry
dont let Taehyung see this video 😂😂
This video is uploaded more than one year. But now I find you 😊
Stupid tasty. There's no professional kitchen that still use non metric measurements. What the hell is a cup?? Use ml or gram for precise recipe
Which soy sauce is best for this recipe?
Well, damn
Not sure where I went wrong, but I ended up having to use 3 1/2 cups of water instead of 1 1/2 cups for the batter. It was about to turn into tempura dough instead of a batter, lol
Alamak!
y’all actin like Panda Express doesn’t just reheat a bunch of frozen chicken nuggets and pour sauce over them
Has anyone tried out this recipe? How did it go?
Uhhhh...I don’t think the batter water measurements are correct, I put in 1 1/2 cups water and that just made a ball of dry dough...I had to add 3 cups of water MORE to get it to the consistency that’s in the video..I double made sure I used the exact measurements for the it...so...🤷🏻‍♀️
I'm weak why is he acting like they cut the chicken conveniently into 1 inch cubes like as if that's not obviously factory generated
I think you forgot the last step:  leave the finished product in the warmer long enough for it to become an inedible dark mushy goo
That's really good.
The batter was WAY too thick.   I doubt this is really the same recipe.
What kind of rice would you guys put with this dish?
There, the most Americanese dish ever
This is more like American-chinese not chinese food lol
Panda express is remind me      Some one special 😂
They pull their shrimp out of freezer bags tho....
I'm hungry now.😁
Easier to go to panda express.😂
who is here for bts??!!!
I’d there a substitute for cornstarch??
i followed this recipe and this was so good and crunchy
Yummy best channel ever
*Chicken: Hmmmm...
I thought you were gonna whip out a dog
I love their honey walnut shrimp, it’s my weakness
It made me mouth watering. I also like ginger beef and honey walnut shrimp at Panda Express. I remember when my daughter was only 1 year old, she had dropped her mouth water while she was looking at the Panda food. :)
plz make me some plz!!!!!!!!!
no MSG :(
nasty looking
Just finished making this. Here are some things I learned. 1. Make a half batch of batter for 2 pounds of chicken. This recipe makes wayyyyy too much batter.  2. You will need more water for the batter. If you do a half batch of batter use just over 1 and 1/4 cups of water. If you do a full batch use just over 2 and 1/2 cups. 3. This recipe does not make very much sauce. Double the measurements for the sauce when using 2 pounds of chicken. 4. Orange zest (grated orange peel) adds really good flavor and I would 100% recommend. About 1 teaspoon. 5. It is wise to cut the chicken a little smaller than 1in pieces. 6. Sesame oil is not necessary. 7. I prefer to use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil when making the sauce.  It tasted great! Better than the orange chicken at an actual Panda Express. :)
Dang. Any sugar substitutes will work right? Lawd lots of sugar 😱 (but bomb af🤣)
Tried this recipe and... IT TASTES LIKE ORANGE CHICKEN but at home❤️ We went to Panda Express when we were in US and tried Orange Chicken since there's no Panda Express here in the Philippines
chicken or cat or dog ,  the world might never knoe
I'm going to tell my girlfriend to make me this😊
Pleased dont say Chinese food. This IS NOT Chinese food.
Why would they give you their real recipe any way the sauce they sell at the store doesn’t even have the same ingredients and is 50% thicker
The best part of going to Panda Express lets be honest
They sell the orange sauce in walmart 😍
good recipe....tastes fine.....impressive
why does mine look nothing like this ...
Now is this the orange chicken that tastes TOO orangey?
i made this today for dinner. and it was amazing. new taste for me. never taste orange chicken before but i think this is so unique and already my favorite chicken dish!!
Ok now Im making *DOG EXPRESS*
Ok, so after doing this about 5 times I can suggest this: 1. the water needed is a little over 2 1/2 cups, as already suggested by someone here. 2. drop the sesame oil at the end, or just use a hint of it. The dish lives well without it.  Other than that, fantastic recipe!! Thanks to Panda Express for sharing this.
This is so delicious but unfortunately my parents are a absolutely repulsed by anything sweet on chicken:/
Did you wash the chicken
I tried this and turned out amazing,😍... made half the coating batter for 2 pound chicken and it worked just as fine.
Bts Taehyung is going to love this..
so it's sour and sweet?
His measurements are way off I just used them and they don’t work
That was an awesome recipe.  😀
I'm here for taehyung
for a second I thought this was taehyung kill me now😂
Reads PANDA EXPRESS       Suddenly starts thinking about   BTS V..........
Can I use chicken breasts?
Thanks fo sharing 👍 I'll surely try this 😊
Lmao I went to China and asked 6 people and they said they didn’t know what this was. I don’t know why but I found this way too funny
This recipe looks so good. I had to put it on my bucket list. Easy. 👍
Will try
wait when did the orange go in?
He didn't remove the fat from the chicken. Interesting.
someone give taehyung this recipe
i wish they garnished the chicken with sesame seeds
Mine turned out salty as hell
First time I made this I was skeptical, but it really do taste like it
I’ve followed this recipe and it was the best exactly like Panda Express orange chicken. Now that I’m overseas and no Panda Express here I’m gonna make this again today and hopefully get the same flavors that I’ve been missing ❤️
I just noticed that Tasty always uses brown eggs!
I work at Panda Express and the sauce is prepackaged lmao stop lyingb
The piece of chicken on the edge of the plate at 2:33 is giving my OCD a though time...
Anyone try this in an airfryer?
bts panda express
Where does the orange part come in? I'm confused
I made this today. It was amazing
I’ve literally been waiting my whole life for this video
Just heads up... The amounts listed in grams in the recipe on the website aren't nowhere near correct. I tried it and the batter turned out very thick... I had to add almost 100 ml of water more to reach the consistency as is in the video...
1:37 when sauce making starts
Mmm!
Just search up online recipes, better than this misleading fake.
I've always enjoyed Panda Express. I got to say even though I live in Taiwan and I really love Taiwanese food=)  when I'm back in the States  I always get Panda Express when is start missing Taiwanese food=)
What type of orange juice do u use?
If you listen CLOSLEY you can hear Teahung's panda express chant 😉😏
What’s AP flour?
I just did thiss and it’s amazingg!
Hello
I can hear taehyung's voice on my head chanting " Panda express wooh!" while watching the whole video. Im crazy😂
Good
Came out PERFECTTTT!!!! And yes use more water in the batter. 👌🏾
Veganize it taking out the egg and doing it with cauliflower instead of chicken
Looks like I'm going to panda now...
Its korean recicep
All armys learning what to cook to tae tae
I made this today and it was good
Mhhh..really good...yazzz
*V's voice* pAnDA eXprEss PAnda eXPRess wOo!
I feel sad for the uncoated chicken at 2:20
😋😋😋😋😋
i love this recepie. the best part here is all the indegrants are easily available..
Can i order ice at panda express?
For some reason i thought this was HowToBasic
*Mmmmm i love Panda Express* 😏
I immediately think about Taehyung😆
I’ll just go to Panda Express thank u
Yo there's a place in Connecticut called panda express, is that the one you're talking about
I always wondered why V is so obsessed with Panda Express lmao
the chicken has gone downhill at panda over last couple of years, tried the recipe with a twist on my end, tastes amazing and don’t need panda no more!
I've made this a few times and it's always a huge hit. When I make it, I just bake and then chop a bag of chicken strips to toss in the sauce. Frying foods smells up the whole house
pAnDa eXpResS
I WANNA EAT THIS NOWW 😭😭😭
These types of videos better stop showing in my recommendation. ITS RAMADAN!
Wrong thing to watch during Ramadan .. imma go bye now
U CAN NEVER GET WRONG WITH PANDA EXPRESS FOOD
*taehyung screaming in the distance*
it’s ramadan and im watching this. i cant stOP HELP ME
I love how in every single food video people taste the food and say "its good". Of course you are not going yo say your food is trash
Organe chicken but with no orange ingredient????
Most asian restaurants   are secretly selling some unknown animal and claiming its chicken i can clearly see its not chicken by how it looks and taste
TIP: swap water with cold club soda/sparkling water for more crunch!
Wait, but what kind of orange juice?
I currently work there and the way this guy made it is pretty accurate to how we make it! 💪🏾
You might as well just pan-fry the chicken any benefit you got from frying it is immediately wasted when you dump it in that wet sauce it's so counterintuitive
Literally nobody:  My brain at 3am: hmmmm let's watch a video on how to make original orange chicken by panda express :/
Now make a Panda Express chow mein video
You missing the msg
Don't tell v 🤫
It's panda express.it is NOT Chinese food.
It still baffles me that orange chicken actually has orange in it. I always thought it was orange chicken cause the sauce makes it look orange. I’m not from the U.S. btw don’t drag me we don’t have this in Germany lmao
V should ask Jin to watch and make it for him 😂
Seeing  the video while thinking of v's (bts) panda express
Make sure you use the right pots and the right fryer and the right chicken we used breast meat in a deep fryer and it worked out horrible
I loved it!!!!! I am making it right at this moment 😍
Who else was sitting in bed hungry
FINALLY YESSSSS 👏🏿
wait, so for orange juice does he mean... like store bought? or squeezed oranges?
2:30
I'd make this with less sugar
YOOOO those are not orange they are tangerine.
I was expecting some Instagrammy Buzzfeedy hack to present their idea of... No.  They got a guy representing the Brand directly.  That's impressive.  You'll never get that out of The Colonel.
Authentic American food
I cook that almost every week and didn't know it was a craze in the US😂
they good
wang
Why am i binge watching tasty videos while fasting again?
Please suggest if I will make little double gravy orange chicken .
That sugar though.
Panda express sucks ass
Fine recipe and it probably tastes good, but with so much sugar it is a food to avoid...fry your own potatoes, it's healthier, just don't let the oil burn cause the fat will become trash!
Kim taehyung brought me here ! 😂💜
Looks amazing!
Why keep the fat on the chicken? I always cut off the fat.. is there any reason i shouldnt ?
You say panda express?       Damn Taehyung
Who disagrees with mixing chicken with sugar and oranges I don't even understand how people eat it or like it even
What's the oil??
😆 the 7 buckets of 10 kinds of sugar at the end there, Jesus.
Now just pass that through the TV and I'll be a happy girl 😊..so yummy
The crisp is not that good ! It’s not the same like panda or any other restaurant!!
so do i use 1 1/2 cups of water or 2 1/2? i see the video uses one cup, and it says one cup along with the recipe on website.
OMG!!! That taste so good ... are with my eyes.
Ok that is not 2 lbs of chicken. I tried making this with 2 lbs of chicken thighs and ended up with enough orange chicken to feed a small village.
yum
I made this for my family tonight... ❤️ Everyone loved it so much there was no left-overs..
I'm trying this!
I always thought there was orange peel involved! Mystery solved!
O.... M....G...
Food poison food poison, YEA THATS ME!!!!
How about the green chicken
I don't care how much sugar it contains, orange chicken for live WOOOHOOOO :D
Do you NEED the white pepper or can you just use black
I made this and heard the angels whisper to me, "My child, you should try this sauce for chicken wings." And then I went to heaven and came back.
Except in the restaurant. It’s frozen.
Pure awesomeness, definitely one of the Best ways to make chicken; although i'd put less than 1/4 cup of vinegar into sauce cause it turned out to be too much sourness.
I always get tasty happy hour ads when I watch these vids
For better crispier tempura batter use seltzer water instead of water
I want it inside me
Can I order sesame chicken at panda Express just wondering
As a Chinese, I detest Panda Express
This makes my food boner so fucking hard xDDDD
Fuck boi
She made her lot of noise in this church! She can't have to be quiet in this church! She stole her food from our friends in the food court! She looked at her friend's food in the food court! She threw her food on the floor! She dropped her food on the floor! She started to punch her friends in this church! She started to kick her friends in this church! She started to hit her friends in this church! She took her clothes off in front of our friends in this church! She started to put her feet up on the large table in the classroom! She can't take her feet down off the large table in the classroom! She can't keep her feet down on the floor! She can't stay in her seat and she got up off her chair in the classroom!
Taehyung: **viciously takes notes** Jin hyung... I need a favor
made it and eating now. followed the recipe and instructions and omg! it is fckn delicious!! WOW :D thank you to the chef and Tasty! :D <3
The Wood cutting board with obviously visible cracks and splits is a definite violation of safe handling of raw chicken. Raw chicken may harbor dangerous bacteria that can accumulate in those cracks.  A definite health violation.
Lol I just went to Panda Express today and got orange chicken it was so good
I was able to buy and cook a good batch of this at home. Brand was called InnovAsian. From Wal-Mart.
my chicken is a little salty what should i do
I just made this for a midnight snack. 😁
Fuckin  rat
*authentic*
I love Chinese food literally it’s my favorite food but why so much salt 🧂 geez!
yuuum
身为一个中国人，我为这道菜感到耻辱，而你却用着你带口音的英语教别人怎么做，请别侮辱中国文化，谢谢
Panda Express 💜
Hi to (all my 100% loyal family)  I just thought of something else  (and this is follow up to my previous post).  Pretty much it’s like if there are “any other people” that I don’t know  that are “associated with” my enemies.  (I’m pretty much 100% sure  that my enemies are only 5 people). But I’m talking about simply “association” since as you all know I only accept “100 % loyalty”   (And 100% loyalty is by-default, not achievable IF they have ever even been remotely associated with my enemies(in peaceful terms)  in the past.)   So yeah, and what I’m going to do about this is pretty much. Since I don’t really have an “absolute way” to find out if they are “associated” with my enemies, if they do past the verification test. (Discord : picture and video) I’ll just keep them added and then I’ll simply “delete them whenever I find out”.   Since I’ll definitely find out once I get in contact with my best friend/ ESTJ and my dad and my therapist. (They will tell me of ofc)  The only people that matter to me is  1. My dad 2. My therapist.  3. The ESTJ girl (Asian 13) 4. My best friend  And so yeah, the idea is that pretty much I’m 100% loyal/to all my 100% loyal family and they are the same to me. And so yeah whoever my 100% loyal family (in this case, it’s the 4 MOST important family members listed above)  tells me to delete then I do it without a second thought (in a blink of an eye) and so yeah....... you get the idea...........   (And they WILL tell me to delete my enemies/ANYONE even remotely associated with my enemies because they are 100% loyal to me and only me) (And they (my 100% loyal family)  themselves obviously wont have any of them added because they are 100% loyal to me and only me and have been ever since from before the beginning of time)  Anyhow you all get the idea lol.  Yep, and just a follow up to my previous post.  To (all my 100% loyal family) Thanks for reading!
During my exchange year, Panda Express always satisfies me everytime i miss Asian food
Lmao where I worked everything came frozen and the chicken is breaded thick and looks nothing like how he made it here
Would you put out the recipe for their bourbon chicken
Bless Panda Express for making this video and giving their secrets out and not just marketing it to make more money. As a kid in SoCal I loved Panda and their orange chicken but once I moved to Europe at 11 it just wasn't in my diet anymore. Whenever I'd fly back to the US Panda was my first stop so I'm happy I can try to make it at home. Also, I discovered I was coeliac at 17 and panda express orange chicken is the only time I've ever said "fuck it" and had gluten anyway.
Panda Express isn't available in my country. First time trying it and it was divine. Thanks tasty
Ninja: I would use white pepper if it exists (watches this video)  Ninja:HOLY SHIT DREAMS COME TRUE
There chicken is garbage you don’t taste Chicken in it
Who else thought Rie was making this
I tried this recipe and it failed so badly
Sugars everything
I'm over here eating frozen pizza dang it lol
Just tried making this with some leftover chicken at home, it turned out fantastic!
How long do you deep fry for?
Lol who else thought of Kim Taehyung (V of BTS) when they read the title!!!😂❤❤ ARMY FOREVER💜💜💜
Love that shit!
I made it! It was really good, thanks
I wish I could mix that fast
I wish I could do this, but most of the ingredients would end in the trash cause I'd only be able to cook it maybe twice and give up cause it was done wrong.
Does panda express taste good? I don't have it in mu country tho
Just made this. Turned out great!!!!!!!! Thanks
i miss their orange chicken! 😭
Licking my phone rn
dope
Our closest Panda Express is 45 mins away so we will drive all that way just to pick up orange chicken and mushroom chicken - I love it so much I could cry! 😭
As much as I fucking hate you Tasty, you actually pulled one off here (if we aren't going to count the mistake of saying 1 1/2C Water when it's supposed to be 2 1/2C).. fucking good niggas! Key is to hand squeeze the OJ yourself for amazing flavor.
looks delicious but also pretty bad for u
I think orange is one of best liquid adder to any dish.
WOW!!!  I tried the recipe and it tastes just like PANDA EXPRESS!!!   its delicious!  I'M so happy. this recipe is the BEST!!!
Hey, Mr. Huang - - you make this look far too easy, but I'mma try anyway, and I'll report back later.  Thanks!
Our GORL would love this
Why does this reminds me of taehyung from BTS?only me?
So the orange chicken is not actually orange..?
2 lbs chicken thighs 1 inch pieces  1 tbsp salt 1tsp white pepper  1 c. Cornstarch  3c. Flour 1egg 2 1/2c. Water 2tbsp neutral oil  Add the chicken to the batter and chill for 30 minutes  Fry for at least 6 minutes  1/4tsp chili flakes 1/2 tsp fresh ginger  1 tbsp minced garlic  1/4 c sugar 1/4 c brown sugar  1/4 c orange juice  1/4 c vinegar white 2tbsp soy sauce  2tbsp  water + 2 tbsp cornstarch  Cook to maple syrup Consistency Add chicken  1 tsp sesame oil
I failed
Haha, wang
Imagine having giftcards leaked around the sketchy part of the internet.
This was truly delicious and easy to make. The only thing I will say is if you're going to make a small batch for yourself(like I did) don't make all of it. Fry enough for yourself because it seems like after you coat it with the sauce, it goes soggy(as expected) and I found that if you fry it a little longer and goes a nice brown colour (not burned) it has an extra crispy exterior and when coated the sauce, it maintains to stay like that.
I just made this it took 2 hours it was really good but it made the air in my house "smokey" it hurts my eyes it's like when u bbq something and these a lot of smoke and it burns your eyes  but with this there's no actual smoke It goes away for 20 min then it comes back i opened all my windows but it still is happening and I made the chicken about 2 hours ago
*p a n d a  e x p r e s s  s u c k s*
Ok now my mouth is watering🤤🤤
If i divided everything by half, will this recipe still work? (not looking to make too much)
Pandaaa expressuuuu
Finna nut...
TAEHYUNG LEFT THE CHAT !
This was good!! Thanks for sharing 🥰
I made this and it was amazing!! Btw if u dont have orange juice teriyaki souce works rlly well
Da moisssure!... 😄😅☺️
" Panda Express is the originator of orange chicken"   0:53
excelente video muy bien explicado, dejeme decirle que a mi familia le gusto mucho el pollo a la naranja estilo panda express muchas gracias por compartir  su receta saludos desde tijuana mexico
There was a guy named Andy COW working at PANDA express
There is no way to cheat Chinese food....  Have u heard of instant noodles
This video reminds me of j-hope💓💓💓💓😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We love panda express💕💓💓💓💓
I am hungry now
guess who's making orange chicken for dinner!!!
2 & 1/2 cups of water!!!
I could smell this through the screen
Sugar no wonder
pls put panda express worldwide yall wouldn’t regret it.
I made these recently and it came out so good! As some people have already commented, you need to use 2.5 cups of water, not 1.5. Either way, the batter comes out rather thick. I will probably thin it out next time. The sauce is really yummy, but is a tad bit sweet and you can definitely taste the strong vinegar, so you might want to use a little less. Other than that, very good definitely recommend!
Can I skip the sesame oil? Will it taste the same ?
Why this video on my recommend when it's 2 am ? Now I'm hungry and I just have instant ramen 😥
Do HONEY WALNUT SHRIMP...PLEASE!
"acidity "
Sweet & sour = Savory
U know when it’s Asian when they put dat ginger
An egg cracked into a batter is not a “leavening” agent.
Looks so delicious. And simple. I didn't know it was that easy to make. THANKS.
I don’t want to be disrespectful and I don’t want to be believe it but do they really serve rats as orange chicken in Chinese buffets because a few weeks I went to eat at one and I got some orange chicken,so I was eating,everything was normal until I saw the chicken and I’m not lying it had the shape of a fucking rat it looked like it had a tail too I didn’t eat it anymore but I still love Chinese food
I’ve never been a fan of orange chicken. Beijing beef is my go-to.
get 100 dollar gift card from panda express if u r from usa  http://bit.ly/2EK8WoT
Why make it at home...go get it at Panda Express.
Okay so we got leftover chicken that didn’t get no sauce...and before I try this I want to make sure...ARE YOU SURE, it’s not at least 2 cups of water for the batter because flour is thick af and I’m not trying to make pasta...
Just did it! It's amazing! Only precaution is that you will need 2 to 2.5 cups of water for the dough (not 1.5 as the recipe says).
Is this copy right? Coz this one of the most popular recipe in my restaurant thanks for Sharing 💵 💵 💵
shame on u calling this chinese food, only Americans eat crap like this
1:09 it looks like clam chowder
all of those likes are from taehyung
Everyone love Panda Express´s food but Chinese
Miss this chicken when i was in nyc last year
Yummy.
How long do you cook the chicken for
"Chinese food you can't cheat it",dude it's american fast food. no offend, there isn't a Chinese food called Orange Chicken
There are fake chinese foods and restaurant look up what is fake and real and how to spot a fake place with fake food
어허 치킨은 두번 튀겨야하는 것인디요
There is no A sound in Chinese.  Wang is actually pronounced Wong. Remember two Wongs don't make a right.
That's really, really dumb of me, to watch this when I'm on my way to bed! I now have to go make a sandwich or something.
I’m from the UK but i’ve been to the US once before and while i was there i got orange chicken from Panda Express been craving it ever since
Sugar Chicken
My orange chicken always gets soggy 😭 why?
Yum!!
Pause at 2:47 LOL
i fucking love this shit guilty pleasure for sure
Z
Him: Chinese food is very technical Me, tossing everything into a wok like whatever:
I'm gonna have to start making it because panda is getting fucking expensive and the amounts are getting smaller.
When you let it chill for 30 mins is that outside or inside the fridge ?
OMG I was burned by the oil 😭
sure
Fucking delicious!
1.2K people accidentally hit the dislike button and didn’t realise it
They forgot the MSG
Delicious and exactly like the restaurant... we need some Ajinomoto to kick up the Umami and do 1.5lbs of chicken not 2 as the recipe states. There won’t be enough sauce for two pounds.
You may want to shave a little orange zest in their too, bud.
Thank you for the recipe, the first time I made orange chicken... It was terrible
I need the tasty headquarters in my house
*see "PANDA EXPRESS"* *remember Taehyung* *clicks*
*I LOV PANDA EXPRESS* army where are you?
I'm eating some rn :)
My chicken crust was more of a pancake batter than a crust???
"in chinese there's no way of cutting way or shortcut" *raugh at chinese products.
can yall shut the fuck up about taehyung lmao
Now please just give me the recipe for Panda’s mushroom chicken and chow mein!
Can't have cornstarch
Would love to make the honey walnut shrimp.
Never even knew white pepper was a thing
kpop is cancer imo.
How does tasty know exactly what I want all the time?! I was just thinking I want Pandaaaa
So much sugar in the sauce!
You forgot the msg
This isn’t how  we make it but ok 👌🏻
I LUV PANDA EXPRESS army where you at?!
I ended up needing to add more water to my batter and my chicken wasn’t crispy. What did I do wrong?? 😩 Still VERY delicious!!
Me : *Calls Taehyung*
Bts has liked the video
My chicken has bitter taste. What should i do?
Teahyung I see you 💜💜💜

*V: **_i LOvE pAnDA eXprESs_*

I've got better recipe of Orange Chicken on my channel but nobody gives a shit about videos I make.
Panda hands down the best orange chicken
Kim Taehyung wants to know your location
Taehyung wants it
Yamy
Can anyone tell me what do you call those white dishes in which the rice is served in the background of this video. I really want one but i don't know what to call it.. Please help
I think the only ones disliking tasty videos are people on a diet 😂
Lmao yeah this is not how it’s made at panda🤣
I will try very soon 😜😜😜
I want to do this but not with meat, what should I use? I don’t like tofu :/ maybe cauliflower?
*which is ur favourite food*? Taehyung: *PANDA EXPRESS*  i remember this...coz in every interview he says that his fav food is panda express
When there is no Panda Express in ur country n u don't have enough ingredient to make this in ur house. R. I. P me
guess whos cooking orange chicken at 2:30 in the morning.
I’m hungry now
They dont even cook it like this or it's like this al all I work at sygma that delivers the food to the and the chicken comes breaded already and the sauce is already made as well nasty ass place not original
Should of fried the chicken a little more if you were going to only coat it with the glaze....
Delicious....😀😀 will try .....
Who are all here to see our gorl Amberlynn's favourite OrAnGe ChIcKeN 🍗
Yammy
I'm hungry for this
I made it. It was AMAZING!
This looks so fucking good
Sugar chicken
Omg
This is make hungry af
Who turned the water on in my mouth!?
What is white pepper?
It looks good but with the way he was chewing ..... Ummm im not to sure
Mines came out tasting like McDonald’s chicken nuggets before I put the sauce. I think I’ll stick with this! Thanks Panda-man!
Is that  dog
Made this for my kids , they loved it thanks chef 😁
100 boi
More recipe plz click this link #tastyfoodsomasharma
I usually don't even write comments but got to say this came out awesome. Thanks so much.
The screen is pitch black the entire time
So is it 1 1/2 cups of water or 2 1/2? It says 1 1/2 on the website 🤔
What type of rice should you eat with this?
Too bad that’s not the actual process in the panda stores 😒
Bro that shit looks Fucking retarded
why is the recipe online so different from the video???
I made this today and the glaze is to die for
Mine came out like $4 Chinese take out lmao nothing like the video
Damn look at all that sugar. Taste great but gonna get diabetes and obesity from this dish.
Watching this while high🍃🔥😎🤤
Im in luv
The original rat meat
Making this for dinner tonight 😍
Dam I love this chicken
Love the orange chicken and Beijing beef.  Video was awesome.
clicked and immediately though of Amberlynn Reid 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Nearly 2000 calories a serving.   Avoid.
My local Chinese spot premakes everything and reheats it in sauce and it tastes microwaved and soggy. Definitely ready to make this fresh from scratch.
You can process Chinese food...stop it you moron
Seriously, 1 1/2 cups water? Are you misleading viewers on purpose? Try 2 1/2 cups water.
I love this but can you guys help me because I am allergic to egg and was wondering how can I make this without the egg? Please and thank you
Omg omg .... omgggg
Damn!!!
There is no milk in this recipe so why does the one in stores contain milk?
I’m making this recipe today it is too much flour I think. I read the comments and definitely needs more water as well.
yessss yummmm
Why would you dislike this 🤦🏾‍♂️
*Kodak black enters chat
Acilily
I can smell this video
ive beeen cooking for looooong time , and  ive used asian  technigues , but you just taught me somthing about sesame oil ive never really thought of before , using it at the end ,,, yea you very good  in heart and yea ty for that . and yes sesame oil should be treated like olive oil and sewrvered ontop at the end plus in the recipe .
This is の Chinese food
Just  wow......
Why iam i looking at this at work when i wasent able to have lunch today cause ran errands in my lunch time😂😂now am starving.
Can't i use black Peper?
This works great without the flour as well if your celiac.
Love orange chicken😍
ingridients?
I recently made this and I can assure that it was absolutely delicious
he use a fork............................................
I can now finally go off grid forever.
never be the same when i make
its called General Tso Chicken
Nasty sugar chicken
Up the water. Give yourself like 3 hours to make this. Double sauce if you like it kinda saucy. And let it sit for a while to soften once sauce goes on. O reheated on the microwave the next day and it tasted just like panda.
That mesurement it off I made it was so think
How could someone dislike this video?
Is there a substitute for cornstarch
Yum.
Look cool
Now teach us how to make their chow mein pleaseeee🙏🏽
Oh yeah yeah
Sugar food
"The story goes all the way back to 87..."  Knowing Chinese recipes he was either going to say 87 BC or 1987
That looks very nice, but the sugar amount seems enormous to me sitting here in Europe. The orange juice is sweet too. Will this not be overly sweet in the end? Is it maybe supposed to be?
Looks amazing glad I got an idea of how it’s made
This great!! I have to cook this soon! :)
That looks like my upstairs flooring... are you cooking on the floor..? 😳
It's so good I make yesterday thanks for the video
I want it in my face hole.
That’s awesome! Thanks for sharing!
I fuckin love Panda Express
This recipe is total BS!!!!  The chicken does not come out crispy at all.  Instead its all goopy and stays pretty much white even after 6 minutes!! And its wayyyyy to much flour!!  I even added more water to no avail!!  Better to go to Panda Express or try someone else's recipe for it!! What an effin waste of chicken!!!
2:33 Now tell me how the fuck ketchup is sour...
Damn I'm so glad theirs the recipe here. My Panda Express got replaced by some shitty eatery
They need to show us how to make the steamed fried rice
2:32 that brings a smile to my face 😊
Gmo Panda
This looks tasty as hell, and I'd gobble that up in a heartbeat!  That being said; That's a lot of sugar and starch...
Panda has gone downhill such a shame
My brother works at Panda Express
Could this recipe be replicated for vegetarians with seitan?
If you don’t want to fry it or use the breading, it works with chicken baked in an oven and it still tastes amazing! I do this whenever I make it so I can stay gluten free.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️
I literally came when he put the fork in the chicken dude
I get honey walnut shrimp and orange chicken and white rice
I just tried the recipe and it was really good!
Panda Express hoo! Panda Express hoo! I 💜 PANDA EXPRESS!! oooOoohhh
No wonder this shit is so bad for you. All that sugar and calories.
My go to sides  Orange chicken and Beijing Beef  Orange chicken 2  Beijing 2    2 means for both sides
that's too much of sugar
I believe its chePer to go to panda n eat rather then buy all ingredients n make it ur self n obviously it not gona taste the same
Most of Panda Express are in America I’m from Canada so I have to wait to go to the us to get it 😓
I'm a 12 year old girl and I can't do this things so I'mma just gonna order😂😅
So there's no oranges in this recipe at all🤔
Their food taste like shit
Ummm no it originated in Japan
Made bread dough, add water lol.
Disgusting really
Just made this and it's fuckin awesome!
*i guess thats why BTS love Panda Express*
That Zimmern guy be damned. This looks awesome!
Ah, the closest thing to sesame chicken that isn't sesame chicken.
Hey .. why is there talking?
Panda taste like shit McDonald's Chinese food
Panda eyes
Sorry but his recipe looks fake. Panda express orange chicken does not taste like other takeout orange chicken. It taste kinda like general tso chicken (well, at least the good panda expresses I've been too cuz some taste really bad)...so I already had my suspicion when they added orange juice (which I think will make it taste bitter) I say this because I've made orange chicken based off an Internet recipe that called for fresh OJ and it had a bitter nasty taste that ruined the whole dish . It might be a good recipe for some people, but it gets me kind of mad when they say "panda express" orange chicken and people buy all the stuff to make it only to realize it taste nothing like it. Anyway, you've been warned. However, try the receipe anyway to see if you like it, but don't get your hopes up.
Is it as good as what you get at Panda Express?
Sorry but that's a waste of good chicken thigh.
Who's here cuz they're making this tonite?..... anyone 🤔
I wish Chinese takeout had the same level of freshness 😂 I don’t even know what kind of meat I’m eating
Thank you! I don't live in the USA anymore but I miss Panda Express. Even having this recipe, i'd still go to Panda if i was there. You Rock!
i cooked it. Its TIRING AND iT TOOK ME 2 HOURS.
Why did my mans like chew that chicken so hard at the end lmao like you can tell he rehearsed it so many times priceless 👌👌
Show me the recipe for that fried rice.
Food poison panda no bueno
Seeing his face at the end made me laugh idk why 😂😂💔
I tried to make this by it don't taste right to me, but it taste great to others.. I followed all the instructions and still filled how that happened😫
for months I've been looking for this recipe thank u so muvhh
This is not even a Chinese dish
I made this tonight and it was very good.  The recipe is screwy though, so BEWARE!! The video and the recipe on the website says 1 1/2 cups water. It takes nearly 3 cups to get the consistency of  pancake batter. I used two pounds of pork tenderloin instead of chicken. I doubled the amounts for the orange sauce (except for the sesame oil) and it was nowhere near enough to cover the pork. I'm glad  I didn't double the amount of sesame oil. One teaspoon was ALMOST too much.
I love their orange chicken because its crunchy which I love. Other places its soggy
I just made this recipe and it’s so delicious 😋👍🏻I made it with chicken nuggets instead of chicken breast 😆because I didn’t have the time to defrost it
Amberlynn Reid, are you watching?
“they always have to do it exactly the way it is”  Nice joke
They don't do this at the actual restaurant.
Been puzzling me for a couple of videos now. By flour do they mean whole wheat flour or all purpose flour or sth else?
All the sauce was made from scratch I learned how to cook everything at my station
We used to have this at my job amazing!
its not seasoned .
So can I just go to my fridge and grab the bottle of panda express orange sauce I bought at the grocery store and save myself a bunch of time?
Work in the morning but am I sleeping? Nah just binge watching tasty videos x
I like the dinnerware which contains vegetables
I just made this I just eye balled how much water to flour I needed i got it the same consistency as the video, like pancake batter basically. I made the sauce and made it pretty spicy to my taste, I can’t wait to eat this at work tomorrow on my break yay
nice and looks tasty
I Hate panda express its food is trash and so are the people who eat there. I'm joking, but it really is nasty imo
I work at Panda Express on ROBLOX. XD
Give us the honey walnut shrimp recipe!
I've made this today and it was delicious !!
Zrobię to
Awesomeness
So good
Which ingediant do I need to take out so it's not spicy?
I’m in the drive thru now.
For a crispy, tempura like breading, substitute half the water for everclear. The alcohol near instantly boils off in the oil, creating a flaky crispy coating. Learned this hack from a French chef.
Could I use this recipe with beef?
If Panda would just change their recipe for the fried rice, I'm sure that it would be so much better! Their fried rice is not what that is. I've been recently getting the white rice instead because the fried rice is always hard and tasteless.
This is NOT Chinese food
Now the shrimp one !!
2:46 the kind of face u want to punch for no reason
Chinese people don’t use measuring cups.
Amberlynn Reid left the chat
You have given me far too much power
wow. my kinda food
The way this guy says acid-dkehy (acidity) 🤐
FANDA EXPRESS WOO FANDA EXPRESS WOO
I never noticed how much crud is in Orange Chicken. A LOT of sugar...
Awesome
Panda Express  All I can say is hehe
Me - ah yes, love this Panda Chicken from Orange Express
My mom makes this
Check my channel out how I made 1mill by the time I was 16
Mushroom and pepper chicken.......mmmm but this is good too
Beijing beef next!
But Why does it always giver me diarrhea?
Any ARMY HERE ?...  -"I love PANDA EXPRESS".
So, I actually had a small argument with someone in the YouTube comments on a video who was actually trying to tell me Chinese food was disgusting.
It's look very good but salt and sugar together is'n my tast.
I  added spring onions in this instead of sesame seeds and it came out way more delicious than I expected
Exposed
Awesome🌟🌟🌟🌟
Do it same, but with non-retarded units.
Orange juice?
Holy 😮
I wanna try making this, how does it taste?
Seokjin oppa....get ur kitchen ready.....
We love pandas express.....pandaa express....ooh.....sing  it like V.....😁
Black pepper chicken is way better I don’t know why everyone is going on about the orange chicken
*inhales* PaNDa ExPreSs
*Taehyung wants to know your location*
Delicious!
Omfg I’m so f*cking hungry!!!!!!!!!!
where my asians at wtf is this shit
You all never tasted REAL chicken and rice, Panda Express sucks
Koloyok......
What temp do they fry at? >.<
Never mind I don’t have to join (well just let me join if you Well but idc either way)   just wanna see what y’all all about LOL  But I do know what this is all about.  13 computer programmers.  Each one has girl/girls that they do shit for (for free) One of them is/was helped me.   Now they are still doing stuff for reasons that I don’t know.  Although maybe it is just 1 of them. Idk.
I need to try making this
Wtf is with these cringy bts comments
I cook for panda and they are definatly forgetting the red chilli and ginger-garlic
PF Changs is better if you don't mind the mark up.
this aint chinese food....
Panda Express is my second home
Some foods you don’t realize how bad they are for you until you actually make it
Never had orange chicken but I hear it’s amazing
buk lau : duh hello, i wan to make bic order todai,  what do you want?  i wan to ummmmm... wan orenji ciken
I only knew Panda Express from bts you should thanks them for advertising now every  army want to make it 😂😂
Mmmmmmm mouth watering 😛😛😛😛😛😛😋😋
How to make honey shrimp!
I remembered Kim Taehyung because of this Video...
That face at the end though
Can I substitute the soy sauce for Worchestershire sauce?
i loBE PANDA EXPRESS          - taehyung
Someone send me the link to the fiery chicken pls
Looks like 糖醋里脊 but with chicken
1:45 I’m sry but Panda Express does not count as Chinese food since it’s so trash and different from real Chinese food, it’s called American chinese food and it’s one of the cheapest American chinese food so don’t expect it to be good
i want to try making this but ppl keep saying youre giving the wrong measurements pls
Looks tasty and ez
Still prefer sesame chicken over orange chicken, just haven’t found the right place that’s makes the perfect sesame chicken! So disappointing!
Looks so gooooooood and I just woke up
Then eats it with a fork. Symbolism at its finest.
Think you should put more oil when you cook with garlic, ginger , and etc before you put sugar and wait a little bit of time while stirring them until it's a bit fried (cooked enough, but not all the way) to make good aromas. Actual Chinese foods are cooked with a lot of oil. Because when garlic, chili pepper flakes, ginger, green onions and all other good ingredients give  good aromas for food and savory taste. But, the chef in the video make so instant because the Panda Express is meant to be.
Is it ok to air fry the chicken or does it have to be with oil
And those retarded buzz feed fake Asian kids wanna hate on this smh
is fake
My batch didnt have  the orange color, enough orange flavor, or enough sauce. If u guys want to make this, i would suggest adding 1/2 cup or orange juice. Idk bc i used juice fresh from the fruit
The only good BuzzFeed channel
Oh this is a game changer
I thought Panda Express sells panda meat
I miss Chowking Orange Chicken there's a restaurant name Chowking a japanese restaurant and they remove chowking orange chicken :(
Making this dish is already a cheat and disrespect to call this a 'chinese' food, ya'll got problems that you so into these fake shit.
Tastes amazing, comes out about 10 minutes after you eat it though :/
1:40 dude, that’s not Chinese food at all.
With great power, come great responsibility  -Ben Parker
Not even real chinese food
stop saying it is Chinese food, because it is NOT!
Agent Panda approves
I don’t taste anything when I eat them though
2:32 Omg I’m Drooling
OMG KILL ME it’s Too Good OOF
If you put orange juice early on wouldn't it get bitter??
In fact there’s no orange chicken in Asia
Who watch this but never do it?
@amberlynnreid now you can make it at home :)
Isn't it chicken Manchurian ? Y u say it's ********
Panda Express whooo Panda Express
Eating it with a fork?!
Made it last night. Delicious ❤
LOL
Yeah
I have no idea how Americans can tolerate this shit. First time I ate this, I threw the entire thing in the trash.
Is anybody else str*king their f*cking c*ck to this video or is it just me...? ..... 😂😂😂😂😂
😍😍😍
I suggest you only use the brown sugar because it’s too sweet sisters you might get diabetes
I watched only Te thumbnail and I thought it was a HowToBasic video I'm dying
I went to Panda Express this week and watching this makes me want to go again
Using corn starch to sauce and sesami oil touch at the end is not chinese way to cook... Actually it's quite korean tech
I went to Panda Express and their orange chicken tasted like garbage
I prefer Lemon Chicken, as a Brit. Definitely worth a try if you’ve never had it!
Two things I really love Chinese food and Chinese women😋
I’ve never had orange chicken before, it’s depressing
If you add honey mixed with mustard while frying it works perfectly
Now do Debbie's *Lemon Chicken* from ELR.
I’ve gone to panda hundreds of times, over 2 years, every time I get Orange Chicken.  Best thing they have besides Chow Mein
putting fresh orange chicken in the steam table and the vinegar just hits like nothing else 😩🤧
Is this halal?
I’m so hungry now!! 🤤🤤🤤
Mcm ayam madu 😅
Very iconic, very iconic, very ICONIC, vEry ICoNiC ❤️
Not even porn videos could make me moan this loud. Holy shit I need to cook some of this.
I tried orange chicken for the first time this year at the age of 17 .. and I’m mad af I didn’t get what the hype was about till now 😭😂🤣
Orange chicken is a variation of General Tso's chicken — and was invented in the kitchens of Panda Express. Panda Express co-founder Andrew Cherng told NPR's The Salt that Chef Andy Kao created orange chicken one fateful day in Hawaii in 1987. Originally, it was served bone-in - but customers there didn't like the bones, so Kao developed a boneless version of the chicken and an American-Chinese staple was born. In China, General Tso is far better known for his battle prowess than for his chicken.
never heard of this even i live and grow up in china for like 22yrs
Fanda fanda fanda express!
orange chicken or sugar chicken?
Is this sweet in taste?
General Tso's Chicken > Orange Chicken
Panda Express is wack. Every time I go there, their orange chicken dry as cardboard.
You guys just lost a million in revenue from me alone 🤪
and a lot of VINEGAR!!!!
Do about half the amount of soy sauce, it overwhelmed the other flavors, do a little extra orange juice too.
Thank you Jimmy!
Is it just me or did watching this video make you want to bite on something?
Original??? Then what happened???
dude has a porcelain chinse takeout box; it doesn't close.
Looks pretty healthy
this might be a stupid question but when he says orange juice does he mean hand squeezed? or do you literally just pick up any carton of orange juice and use that?
Oh my fuking gosh i love orange chicken
Made this last night and it was a complete disaster! Dry to wet ingredients in batter is way off! Hey Tasty! Please correct this.
Might freestyle to this orange chicken freestyle my nigga
I made this for my bf's family and they love it
Just got done making this and omfg my family of nine is worshipping me
Looks to good.
at 2:41, YOU NEED TO SPRINKLE SOME SESAME SEEDS
Panda express doesn't make it fresh. It comes out of a bag then they fry it
n
Amechinas food
delicious but this is so bad for you   corn starch sugar brown sugar soy sauce  avoid all of these ingredients when you can, look it up if you don't believe me
The only chinese dishes doesn't exist in china
I think this chicken is made from Monica Lewinsky’s turds.
As an ethnic Chinese, I would say this shit is disgusting. Sorry for the strong language, but I hate this kind of Americanized Chinese food, it’s just fake as fk.
Just to let you know, there is no such a dish as "orange chicken" or "General Tao's Chicken" in China lmao
Use msg instead
Lmao the guy speaking sounds so high
Mine tasted more like sweet and sour chicken,
Cool! Now I don't need to go to Panda Express anymore!!
Sometimes I want diarrhea, sometimes I want to vomit. For the special occasions when I want both, I go to Panda Express 🐼🤮💩
*Well fuck me in the face, that's a shitload of sugar*
Fuck man now I want Panda ...
This video made up my girlfriends mind as to what she wanted to eat. Very satisfied
More like fake chinese food ahahhhaaa..
But, but, this is not Chinese food.🥺
I cook this tonight and omg.. the result is unbelievable  good! Everyone in my family go crazy  about this. Thanks so much for sharing.
Am I the only one that finds orange chicken kinda gross
add finely chopped onions and black pepper
The fucking buzz feed community isn’t making a wang joke. Jesus
The orange chicken can packaged in a different way...
Watching this made me never want to eat orange chicken again lol. never realized how unhealthy this was
Too much sugar
my adblock wasnt...strong enough????.....by god...
Never had it
See, Tasty?  You can make excellent videos without awful vocal fry.
I love going to Panda Express, seeing them pull out bags of frozen chicken to re-fry and drench in sugar.
i know im not the only one who loves those fried little pieces that come off the chicken in the pan 😩😫😋
I almost licked the screen
I tried making this today and completely ruined it
So basically sour genaral tao
Is this HowToBasic?
Panda Express is gross. Pick Up Stixx is far superior.
Unfortunately, it's hit or miss as far as the size of the "cubes." I prefer them smaller so they're more crunchy and sticky with the sauce. Sometimes they cut them too big and they're not crispy, but rubbery.
I used the sauce mixture but instead of chicken I used buttered shrimp.
Omg I want to make and eat this SO bad! DROOL.
Why would you use wood to cut chicken
This video offends me deeply because im a pos sjw.  Excuse me while i commit soduku.
Orange chicken would make a great po' boy. Dress with sriracha mayo, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. Be sure to use a baguette.
I don't understand the hype of panda express, it doesn't taste like anything
*Taehyung is totally happy about this.*
He forgot to message the 3 gallos of MSG
I should watch this so that I can relate with taeyhung
http://autotrafficmagnet.com/thankyou-page/11131
I love 🐼 express
That is a lot of sugar. Woww.
I definitely want to try this
I worked for panda and let me tell you we never used brown sugar .  So automatically this is not the correct recipe
Chinese Food on MAINLand China is waayyyy Healthier
Deathonaplate
Looks like I'm getting Panda Express for dinner tonight.
Fake Asian food!!!
Fake Asian food!!!
This is PRECISELY why I don't eat Panda Express..
I tried this recipe and it came out super tasty and the chicken was so crispy!!!!
I’ve never cooked anything by Tasty before but I made this orange chicken yesterday and it was FUCKING AMAZING I really didn’t expect it to be so good and the recipe was super easy to follow. 100% recommend making it!!
Orange chicken from Panda Express tastes like fucking cardboard
BRB Going to panda
Double deep fry for delicious CRUNCH!!!!
Is it boneless
😓this it not a Chinese dish, not even like a bit.
i just nutted
I have all ingredients but not chili flakes. What  can I substitute it with?
I have every ingredient except chicken thigh😶
Eating orange chicken and walnut shrimp right now lol
HERE BEFORE TAEHYUNG
okay so how hot did he cook the pan on??? to make the sauce??
I love this shit
Sesame oil is so fucking overpowering idk how people use more than a tiny drop of the stuff it ruins anything you put too much of it in
Omg
Wait orange chicken = ORANGE JUICE I’m going to Panda Express everyday now.
This is such a fool. I used to work there I swear to god you dont wanna know the truth.
Cant do ginger. Will taking it out mess up the recipe?
Just made this, it was delicious! 😋
Absolute wizardry.
V?😂
Do original chicken teriyaki by Sarku Japan! So delicious!
Hmmm orange chicken is waaaaaaaaaaaay more simple than I thaught
I'm not american so I've never had this (no 'Panda Express' here), but it looks AMAZING!!
I work at panda and yeah this is all correct
Finally I made It!!!! Thanks guys!!!
Yu like Chinese food
damn that looked better than panda....ima try that shit
Im going to make this 😍😍😍😍 I love 🐼 express orange chicken. I hope they show how they make their fried rice and walnut glazed 🍤 shrimp 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Can i use chicken breast instead of chicken thighs
Why so much sugar ?
Ah, well now, this is interesting. You actually use boneless thighs instead of chicken breast? That's nice to know. Thanks for sharing!
Definitely the first in a mainstream market, I’m sure it’s been done elsewhere before though
Fuck yeah!
Oh didn’t know it was that easy
I heard alot rumors that panda express isnt as good as they say they are but imma try it anyways. Just to give it a try
get conventional chicken, add sugar fat and salt and voila!!! health monster
extremely unhealthy, VIP ticket to the fast death.
I like how hr says moisture like 'moi-shoo'
My heart is a flutter
Screw orange chicken honey walnut shrimp 🍤 is better
Nah. There's a lot of ways to cheat Chinese food. chemicals and shit
All I’m saying is my school got the best orange chicken I’ve ever tasted hands down  and it’s the only good lunch we have so they fuck is over and we only have it once ever 2 monthes
#fakeChinesefood
Put this video immediately into my spank bank.
Anyone have the name of the portable cook top being used in this video?
Wtf the chicken is A LOT bigger at the Panda Express in my city. Those pieces of chicken looks small!
Uhh TBH I thought they called it orange chicken because of its color I didn’t know there was orange’s in “orange Chicken “ I’m sorry triggered people
Looks amazing, likely tastes gr8 but watching this cooked u can see how bad it is for you. Shit load of oil and a wks worth of sugar. Def gotta eat this in moderation. Tiny portion is prob 1200 cals if not more.
Nasty
Your story of orange chicken is bullshit. I have index cards from the 60's that have orange chicken
Nice
this vid gave me a boner
All other Chinese joints can't make orange chicken the way Panda does.
I haven't test it but I am gonna to tast it soon
I made this and the measuring of flour and cornstarch is too much .. so i make it 1 1/2 four and 1/2 cornstarch .. it works perfectly..
Hey guys, Can we a expect a "Tasty China" page? I think it would a fantastic platform to cover an infinite range of dishes, and recipes, and lots of subscribers to fish out I'm sure!
PaNdA ExPrEsS and SPRITE.
Made it at home, great recipe 👌
First time knowing there was an Asian food called orange chicken
Guys are out here just lying about this recipe, I followed it  only without the brown sugar; however I added honey and orange rinds . It came out perfectly delicious!!! We get it , y’all have eaten at Panda Express before... if this isn’t what they serve there then stay home and make it yourself. The way some of you are angry out here ... you might just get laid.
My family
I'm going to make this today but I'm not going to add a 1/4 cup of vinagar, just can't do it, sounds like it would be way to much.
ive seen panda make their orange chicken and its definitely just frozen chicken and bagged sauce try again
Instead of water, you can also use milk for the batter. and add onion powder. then overnight chill, i promise you it would be the best orange chicken yet
How many mililiters is 1 cup? There's no way 3 cups of flour make as little as the video shows...
And I'm sitting here eating American Deli.
I tried a piece of orange chicken at Panda. So bad, it's chicken marinated in sugar syrup. Can't even taste the chicken. I don't like American food chains because it simply has no taste. American taste buds are so screwed up that you just eat anything with syrup on top of your food.
ITS TAKEN ME ABOUT FOUR HOURS FOR THIS RECIPE. I AM EAYING THIS OUT OF RAGE
That NYC accent tho
Uh i did the recipe to a tee and my batter is more like dough....
that’s a lot of sugar tho. They purposefully use brown sugar with white sugar to make it look less sugary but yeah.
can i do with black peper ?
I keep coming to this video & I just want panda 😩
i just nutted
1:37 then explain why my friend saw buckets of MSG (mono sodium glutamate) outside of a Chinese restaurant?
damn i thought it was just frozen stuff out of a bag
Get Trader Joe’s frozen Mandarin Chicken. It comes with a glazed pouch. Heat it up in the oven, pour glaze. Tastes just like Panda Express Orange Chicken.
I'M HEARING TAEHYUNG SAYING "I LOVE PANDA EXPRESS" WHILE WATCHING THIS VIDEO..I GOT CHILLS
This is like telling plankton the krabby patty formula
Absolutely delicious😍👏🏾
FACT: Panda Express has many dishes with broccoli in it and, Brocolli isn't even native to China.
Hmmmmm tasty!!!
THIS IS LITERALLY MY FAVORITE VIDEO EVER
I dunno if it's just the way the video is coloured or something, but here at 2:33 it actually looks like a deep orange colour, whereas mine looked more brown IRL :( I even tried with less soy and more orange juice, but was just a lighter brown and didn't taste as good. Anyone else managed to get theres to look more orange?
What can I use instead of orange juice?
V from bts has a love for PANDA EXPRESS
Fucking cheaters are branding chicken pakoda. The whole country is full of cheaters.
I Love this channel 😄
Full recipe?
When you work at Panda Express and know that ain’t what it’s made with 😂
Can you do this with tofu?
I just had this along with Hot Pot I know weird combination but I had the chicken as a side
Thought this was how to basic😢
Panda express is not the creator of orange chicken. But they still make some good orange chicken.
just made it and my kitchen smells like a fucking asian restaurant, Its pretty delicious and absolutly worth it!!
I thought it was how to basic
Small and not even good enough to come back  You should delete this video. Panda Express is made Americans I'm sure of it. (I dont know the facts) but the food there just doesnt taste authentic.
His face was holy shit i have to act like i actually enjoyed this nasty thing
It reminds me BTS😂😂👌🏻
I am the only person on this earth that cannot eat any meat that has sugar. lol I am watching the video because  its satisfying.😂😂
How about the sweet and sour pork? Can you do more panda recipes pleeeease!!
Not real Chinese but kinda tasty
Trader Joe's orange chicken in the frozen food section is just as tasty, plus you don't have to fry it.
He's lying he's just trying to throw you off so you don't watch the other orange chicken videos
Any amber haydurs here?
I'm starting to hate BTS now. 😶
Damn we don’t wash our chicken any more ?
What kind of orange juice do I use
Panda Express is garbage compared to real Chinese food
For all the Asians out there:     White Person: I LOVE CHINESE FOOD! ESPECIALLY PANDA EXPRESS ORANGE CHICKEN!!!  Asian: Fuck you that ain’t real chicken.
DIEBITES RIGHT THERE
That's too much breading. I cut the ingredients down so no breading goes to waste afterwards:  For 2lbs of chicken:  1 cup flour 1/4 cup cornstarch 1/2 tbsp salt 1/2 tsp white pepper 1 egg 1 cup water 1 tbsp oil.  Hope this helps!
PLEASE!!! CAN THE OWNERS OF THIS CHANNEL STOP MAKING ME WANT TO EAT MY PHONE, I THINK I WILL UNSUBSCRIBE!
I attempted this for the first time this past weekend. Turned out great!
I should be on my strange addiction for this stuff I eat it so much.
This looks amazing.
Fact: Orange chicken was invented in Hawaii in 1987 😊
But it’s actually fresh
Panda express Logo on shirt !!! You will be fired!!:))
So...
Where the msg at tf
am i the only one who hates orange chicken
I made my first orange chicken.
2 & 1/2 cups water for the batter, you subtitles are scuffed
why the fck do you force employees to ask for donations
Dang cuh, good looking out.
😋😋😋😋
😍
I want Panda Express now please
Looking great
ياليت احد يترجم المكونات والطريقه  اكون له من الشاكرين
why are they doing the same thing again? maybe they are waiting for some food recommendations in the comments XD
@taehyung is Love's that.
I can’t help but think of Taehyung, he loves Panda Express lol
👍😋
https://youtu.be/NJ7_-NqiGlM
No panda express in the UK but this is a great alternative!
Looks very tasty made me hungry love to try new things
Give. ME. *SOME!!!*
The video says 1 1/2 cups of water but it is 2 1/2 cups
*We Love Panda Express*
@ taehyung
i always get the same 3 things the honey nut shrimp, fried rice, and chowmain
Taehyung be like.... woww... I like Panda express
Oh dude not now  Im trying to cut some weight right now😭
soooo good
Somewhere in China someone is flipping tables because you called it "The Orignal Orange Chicken." Lol
Was this before or after they made it spicy? Had it one week, absolutely delish...went and got it again a week later, had to guzzle down 2 glasses of milk 😑
i tried to go to panda express the other day but the entire street was blocked off by a parade. totally ruined my night.
Let them get to 10 mollion subs
I think the best part is how many "I only eat white meat" people love orange chicken. o_0
Empty stomach 😩😤
fuck yes, people say its not really chinese food, fuck those fuckin people, i love Orange Chicken
I just tried this with lemon instead of orange, and it turned out really good. I halved the vinegar because I thought it would be too acidic, and I'm glad I did. I think some people might want to add more sugar to compensate for the missing sugar from the orange, but I like it. I also left out the ginger, but that's just because I didn't have it, not because I didn't want it. Still good, though.
If you reduce the amount of flour by one cup and add half a cup of orange juice to the glaze it's perfect
1.5 cups water is not enough. U need about 2 cups of water
Still going to the drive-thru
"When people think of fast food, they think it's processed. With chinese food, there's no way to cheat it. You always have to do it exactly the way that it is, or else it doesn't come out with the right result. Everything is very technical. That's one thing that we're really proud of." BAM! Massive amount of sugar gets dumped into the pan. I don't know if that editing was intentional, but well played right there.
Koloke
I'm glad you guys didn't hired the "oh yeessss" guy for this video. Thanks Tasty.
2:44 lol
Never had orange chiclen before, what does it taste like?
Anyone has an idea what the name of the song by the end is please ?
0:33 “cornstarch is my bwest fwend”
Yum
I’m drooling now 🤤
I love the crunchiness of it
i did not know this is how they make it. i loooove orange chicken.
Looks so yummy good!
I'm getting the ingredients for this on Sunday when I go grocery shopping!!!!!!
What she said
Thanks Chef! I watched this for 5x and made myself this yummy goodness for lunch😋 all good
"panda express invented the orange chicken"     literally the worst orange chicken is from panda express..
How do you make the pasta that’s what i wanna know
So his ap flour, corn starch, sauces and etc are not processed he thinks?))
I made this and it is the bomb!
Excellent clip
I know what im cooking tonight just for me...
That bit with a fork at the end was. Ok
Wow! It’s so easy to make 😱
1;48 puts a tone of sugar in
I bet its still not the same recipe
Is the batter ingredients correct on the video as 1 egg and 1 and a half cups of water to the dry ingredients has made me a dough not a batter! HEEEEELP!
Maaaan why do you have to go and put fucking sugar in this. Damn it.
Wow... superb
OMG THIS LOOKS DEVINE°
Nice!
I always get orange chicken ALWAYS
Why did I clicked on this video
Can we try for Beijing Beef from Panda Express?
Can this be chilled overnight?
jesus christ dude that looks SOOOOOOOOOOOOO fucking good
I did this and it tasted amazing! One problem is that I had to add one extra cup of water to the batter because it was way too thick and nothing like the video, maybe it is a typo or something.
Can you do the chow mien they do??
blah unhealthy americanized chinese
So there's no fucking orange in it....
Tasty always be havin me with these late night cravings
5 :00 In the middle of the night.      Help.
🙏
that was not 2 tbsp of soy sauce it was wayyy more
The video says 1 1/2 cups of water but the recipe is 2 1/2 cups. This makes a huge difference so I suggest going off the recipe in the link to be safe. You can buy their orange sauce in a bottle at a supermarket too if you're in a hurry.
That looks incredible
I can taste it through the screen. Yum!
I bet all my money in my Korea saving that Taehyung watched this video and attempted to make it
If you buy the bottle of "Orange Chicken sauce" at the store it tastes nothing like the original. I'll try this recipe at some point
You got us paying white meat prices for dark meat quality! 🤢🤒👊
Egg is a leavening agent?
This is just amaaaazing! Just did it today and it was awesome!!! I used chicken breast tho but ohhhh soooo good!
Omg i am drooling 🤤
Panda Express is *stingy* with their portions.
I wish American's would just learn metric like normal people. Having to stop every 3 seconds to convert is annoying.
I think dude's having a tough time chewing it down. "Its really good" 😅 peace
Omg this looks SO good 🤤🤩🤤 Am hungry 🤤🤤🤩🤤🤤
True way of asian cooking is a wok, chopsticks, and no measuring tools. This video is fake!!!         lol jk
This was delicious!
Yum 😋
Taehyung
I’ve ate this before and it tastes so good
This is called Sweet and Sour Chicken (Hong Kong Style) in England.
Ok panda orange chicken I tried this method . The battered chicken as described here cook up the way it says was not good texture was not pleasing and taste was lacking.  The sauce however was good.   So to improve on this I seasoned the chicken nuggets with salt garlic  white pepper and tossed the in cornstarch throughly . I pan fried the nuggets in butter and oil tossed them in the sauce and enjoyed them all.  It was a little sweet but real good
I made this a few times, and the recipe was amazing.  You won't have leftovers when you make it.  My only criticism I had was the cornstarch.  I had to cut the amount for the chicken batter about 1/3 cup.  If you never cooked with cornstarch, it makes batter much heavier.  Too much, and your batter has the consistency of play doh.
That is not Chinese food...
Holy fick
I’m making this right now and I can tell you that 1 1/2 cups of water will not do, if anything 2 1/2 cups otherwise you’ll be making a dough 😑 ........ fingers crossed 🤞 hope It turns out ........ well tasty 😋
I hate when these kinds of vids are on my recommended at 3 am lol    I’m so hungry and don’t want to wake up my parents lol
Y u no use wok
PLOT TWIST ITS A KFC RECIPE
That chicken aint get no seasoning...No Thanks
Made this using two cups of flour instead of 3, and two cups of water instead of 1.5. I also seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt and pepper before I dumped it into the batter. Results were soooo great!! Will be making this for my family next time!!!
Came out splendid aside from my rubbery rice...added pineapple as well it was bomb.
So it's not made out of rats
Now that I have the recipe, I don't think I'll ever need to go to Panda Express ever again  *goes anyways*
This made me so hungry idk why
Just made this it was so good. But a little bit to vinegary
Tried this recipe yesterday. I cut the dry ingredients in half, and still had more batter than needed. The batter was thicker than it needed to be (yes, I caught the mistake in the video vs. the recipe). I feel that if I had thinned the batter just a little more, it would have been crispier... instead it was too thick and bready.  In the end, I'd like to boost the liquid quantities in the sauce... I prefer this dish to have more sauce, and be less like the glaze it is, but the flavors were good.  I've modified the recipe to my liking, and it's in my catalog with Asian staples... even though it's an Americanized dish.  Just my $.02
An alternative for brown sugar?
too bad their chicken served at their restaurants is frozen
Orange chicken is like American chinese food
Jimmy 'Chicken' Wang
I just made this recipe for dinner last night and I think the ratio is off. 2 lbs of chicken was actually A LOT. Yes I measured it out on my scale. The sauce seemed very little to me so I made 1 1/2 recipe just in case and it still wasn't enough. I should have just doubled the sauce recipe. My orange chicken came out really light in color. It wasn't  a dark, orangey Amber color like in the video. Over all the flavor was good but not like his and I followed the recipe step my step
Yum! Gotta love Panda Express baby🤩
I made it and it was so good
I thought of Taehyung throughout the whole video
Taehyung should definitely meet him        Or ask Jin (eomma) to cook it for him 😏 😂
Looks great.   I'm too lazy to make this, just go to the Chinese place and get takeout.
😛
I actually tried this ... now im eating the chicken.. wow.. best thing I made in 2018
I've only ever had panda express once in my life when I went to the states and it was yummyyyyy.
Yummy😊
I’ve never tried Panda Express
I just finished eating orange chicken from panda express
I swear chinese cooks are so creative when it comes to cooking, its the best and nothing comes close to it
.
OmG HiS nAmE iS JIMIN WhAt A StRanGe CoNcIdEnCe 😂
Jimmy Wang? I only know Jackson Wang😏
Who is here because of Taehyung kim😁😁😂😂😂😂😂me
Sugar??? No thanks
Tried this out. Followed recipe to a T. It tastes nothing like Panda Express and was actually a complete disappointment flavor wise. The fry batter was great, very airy and crispy, but the sauce on top was a complete 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 also took about 3 hours from getting the oil to temp to only doing a few pieces of chicken at a time to not overcrowd the pan as each batch must cook for 5-6 minutes. Too much effort, just go to Panda. I want to note the people I made this for liked the flavor, but agreed it was nothing like Panda Express. It's a no from me, though. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Panda Express.. *whispers* panda panda pANDA EXPRESS (ayy) Panda! Panda! Panda EXPRESS! (And sprait!)
garbage
I want!!!!!
NOOO! He cut the Raw Chicken on a wood cutting board.....  :/
The Grilled Chicken teriyaki next plss
This guy has just saved me several trips to Panda Express.
I made this. I'm not sure what i did wrong with the batter. But, I had to add extra water because when I went to mix the cornstarch and AP, it got to thick. I just added enough water, to smooth out the recipe.
I love orange chicken!
Well I know what I’m making tonight
Once again, the measurement provided for the video do not match the measurements provided in the recipe. So you’re left wondering which one to follow. FYI, don’t follow the video...no bueno orange chicken.
what kind of oil into batter?
Shame on you for not giving right recipe Soo much flour not enough water!I ended up with cement!!!!!
I always wanted to taste the orange chicken but couldn't as the meat was not halal .. and i did came across the video and made it, came out amazingly delicious .. thanks a ton for the post .. finger licking good .. 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Please open up in India! It's great investment! Some 1.3 billion people would love it! ❤️❤️
I'm hungry now 😭😭😭
Watching this while I'm eating orange chicken
Finally made this today, it turned out perfect! 😄 I left the pepper flakes out of the sauce so it wasn't spicy, and holy moly it's just perfectly sweet and delicious with fresh rice and steamed veggies.
Is there a substitute for egg?
Do more of these please! More recipes from Panda Express
WARNING FOR THOSE MAKING THIS RECIPE: The video says 1 & 1/2 cups of water, but the real recipe is supposed to be 2 & 1/2 CUPS OF WATER. Says on the website that it is 2 & 1/2
Really panda express founder?, I guess my uncle is founder of Cantonese style sweet and sour sauce
I made this recipe and the batter for the chicken is actually 2 1/2 cups of water, NOT 1 1/2 .
“No way to cheat Chinese food” ok but orange chicken isn’t even a thing in China so idk if this could be considered Chinese food
I miss the Panda express : -(
*I can hear Taehyung saying Panda Express*
Ok
What kind of oil, any?
Tried to make this and I couldn't get my chicken to stay separate
Straight up BTS SUGA should see this
this came out amazingly thank you
Trying to act like panda Express isn't processed hilarious.
This is such a simple recipe man that’s crazy
So, video says 1.5 cups water. Recipe is actually 2.5 cups. No wonder the batter was ridiculously thick. Thanks Tasty.
They should've played mic Drop in the back (BTS)
lol, there are no real asian ingredients in the dish.
V Will Love it ❤️❤️
Taehyung must see this😄
It uses orange extract, not orange juice. Whoever taught you this recipe taught it wrong.   -Former Panda Chef
1- can it be done? Orange Beef? Any meat? Has anyone tried it? If so How is it?
Finally, thank you! Ive been wanting to make this @ home....got so sick of employees @ PE being stingy with serving orange chicken.
Person One: What food do you like to eat in america which is not in korea?  Person Two: P-Panda Express?  whoOo do You thiNk is PerSoN one And TwO
3 cups of flour is too much. Had to add more water.
Tried using dominos chilly flakes and the thing burned in a second. It smelled toxic af
Jin needs to cook this for taehyung
Panda express doesn't use whole pieces of thigh. Ever bit into a piece of orange chicken? Its like a sponge texture inside. They probably use meat glue and or grind up and combine it. Fucking phony, at least be honest
Taehyung would love this
my mouth is watering
.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!! You FOOLS! Now I can steal their recipe and use it in my OWN restaurant!
I wish Jhope sees this and able to make himself orange chicken Jk I bet only Jin would have to make it for him 😂🤣
Ahooo yesss!
Bet the 494 dislikes got burnt taste buds. Like if I’m wrong
Who else thought of Jackson Wang
So they cook it in ooblek dough
I JUST GOT AN AD ABOUT SOOYEONG WHAT EJEBEJE
Is that finely chopped garlic and ginger? Is that low heat and than gradually build up?
i’m going to try this with tempeh :)
My fav express panda
Every time I go to panda I get chow mein and two things of orange chicken with all of it covered in teriyaki sauce and makes it so good
So easy i will definitely try
Jimmy WANG
I never been but now I want to go
AND SPRITE!
1:21
Did it here in brazil! Awesome!!! I was missing the panda food
I LOVE THIS RECIPE LIKE IF YOU AGREE
So good
I will be making this this weekend. For certain!🤩
Omg
Made it. So simple yet delicious. It was an instant hit with my friends. Thank you !
Distorted Chinese food at its best. Especially when so much sugar is involved. It's like when you don't know how to make things taste good, just dump a lot of sugar.
Now I'm hungry
Panda Express sucks now, it doesn't taste as good as before and  the price of a  combo is expensive.
My mouth is watering.... I was literally craving this last night TvT
Hahaha “with Chinese food you can’t cheat”, he’s saying like orange chicken is real Chinese food. Nobody in China ever eats this
Why I'm a fucking VEGETARIAN!!!!!!!, btw the reason is my parents are.!
Most of the commenters are ARMY
Can i replace soy sauce with something else??
I work at a panda express and the chefs of where make the orange chicken different than how this guy did in the video.  I'll definitely have to make this recipe and make a comparison 😊
Damn it all I need is the chili flakes:(
Am I the only one not listening to whatever he was saying nd only looking to the cooking?!
*tae...* i sense him
Dear Tasty, I am in Singapore. What is emperor tso's chicken?
Haha I'm eating orange chicken right now suckers
There's Acilaly at 1:52
Panda Express!
I'm going now...bye #grocery #starving #cook
Sharpen your knife!
Yeah they used to have one in Vancouver we still go all the time this is the best chicken well until I came across Korean food
I've never went to Panda Express but I still love Orange Chicken
Not being stereotypical or anything  but did anyone else think when he was going to eat he was gonna use chop sticks
And here i am watching it while fasting😯😯
Wish I was there
Man I want some now
Who else ordered Panda Express after Watching this video? 🤗
I just Finished making this Orange chicken At home it Came out perfectly  the flour and cornstarch really does the trick for crispy feel  I like mines spicy so I added more chili Flakes   I will make again my bf  ate overate because it was so good now he got tummy ache lmao 😂😂
Why am I here, I’m a vegetarian 😂
Too saucy. What I love about Panda Express Orange Chicken is that it's not slobbered in sauce
*I LOVE PANDA EXPRESS* *AND SPRITE!!!!!* Hehe guess who said that...😁😁😁
I really hate you.
Omg my mouth is watering..looks delicious!🤤
To me it taste like chicken nuggets with orange sauce
I had to use a lot and I mean a lot more water than 1 1/2 cup. I used at least 5-6 cups I think
FANDA FANDA FANDA “taegi voice”
catch me doing this with cauliflower instead of chicken. hell yes
Love it
Great recipe. Sooooooo delicious. Ty!
I have never eaten at panda express but i want to
Panda Express reminds me of Tae😂
Why dont people make their chicken wings like this? Orange chicken wings and if want spice do General tso chicken wings. Omg
I’m really upset because I’m watching all these food videos and I’ve walked downstairs about 12 times for food but I keep forgetting we don’t have food so I keep thinking It’ll magically reappear.
I tried making this and the batter got all doughy... Am I just bad at cooking or am I not alone???
I want it now :(
Does anyone know if rice vinegar would work well, for the sauce, instead of regular white vinegar?
Can someone tell me what kind of oil because it doesn’t say what kind
So is it better to use chicken breast or thighs ? I always use chicken breast
the skill
How come the orange chicken that I get from panda express has half the meat inside compared to what's in the video? Still dope tho will get it again lol.
You Americans are so lucky you don't realise how many different and original stuff you have over there I don't have a panda express from where I live :'-(
Why am i even here? I am vegan
I made this and you're going to need double the cups of water when making wet batter!
Why do they always upload the same recipe in another video
This and sweet fire are my favorites!
Orange Justice?
🤤🤤🤤
i wanna taste this but we dont have panda express in my country 😥
Fake chinese food white people's verson... bitch ass fuks....
HE USED A FORK IM SO ANGRY
Would refer Lemon Chicken, please?
I live in China. None of that around here :(. The things I would do to eat some orange chicken. or general Tso chicken. Real Chinese food is so much more different.
0:53 Whaddya mean by oil?? Is it vegetable oil or olive oil???
Suddenly i remember Kin taehyung😂
😲😲😫😖
Can I make with out sugar it's possible or not ??
The batter is way too thick and ended up as a clump in the pan. The orange sauce was good though
I'm just buying the bottle, but nice to see how to prepare the chicken I use breast I'll try thigh next time
I made this and I’m forcefully eating it rn. The cornstarch made it to pasty
Better than pineapple pizza lol
im eating just a simple rice with fried egg topped with ketchup as im watching and dreaming that i eat those delish
Wow! This is so easy... I can make this. 😄👍
what u mean u cant cheat chinese food u can cheat on all food nordic food and western food and chinese food taste better if its real but u can still cheat it
I work for panda express in yonkers and this is not how its made. Wouldnt eat orange chicken if i was starving.
Sweet and Sour, Orange, Sesame and General Tso's chicken are all the fucking same thing
Oh Yes! I'm a chef thanks to this channel! :)
Chicken... on a wooden cutting board?
More restaurant recipes
Do they really serve the chickens in this amount tho?
This video shows how shitty those hot plates are. The heat is so uneven
Looking at this food, I wish I knew what pander express was
Just made this! I eat kosher and so I can't go eat the real delisious sticky (OMG STOP ME) thing at the store. This recipe is awesome, and taste SOO much like the orange chicken, sesame chicken american chinese restaurant classic. YUM!
OMG ITS DELICIOS !!! (but it take to looooong.. to fried the chicken
Would love to see the teriyaki chicken!
Their orange chicken is good but chow mein is greasy asf
Bon Appétit bitch 🍓🍭🍒
1:37 WOOOWWWW
Hi think I'm hungry
what the fuck is a panda express
Thank so much for this recipe, I followed it and it turned out perfectly!
So fire
I LOVE PANDA EXPRESS     Army will definetely get this joke
Am I the only one who smells the Orange Chicken from the air while watching this? Haha
Now why won't KFC drop their recipe on a TASTY video!?
I've only had Panda Express once, but it was a huge disappointment. If I go back, hopefully I will have a better experience; maybe they were just having an off day or something. I can't hate a restaurant because of one poor experience. However, I did notice something that the cartoon Rick and Morty pointed out: in the show, a character states she got Panda Express for dinner, and her daughter asks "Did you get sugar chicken?" The mother responds "Well, that's pretty much all they have." It seems like sugar is in a lot of their options. Even the eggplant tofu dish, which one would think would be a healthier choice, contains 17g sugar, compared to the honey walnut shrimp, which only has 9g. One would think something with "honey" in the name would automatically be a much more sugary dish, but apparently not.
It may be Chinese American food, but it's tasty!😋
I tried this recipe... theres wayyyy too much batter left over its really sweet and it kinda tastes weird... or maybe thats just my lack of cooking abilities im 15 btw :>
It was all good until the 1 1/2 cups of water
...aND SPRITE
Taehyung approve of this
Haha. I've been thereca few times and it's the only thing I've had there. I've tried to mimic it and have come close, but not quite... I'll try this and see how it goes. Thanks!
No man it's remembered cause that dank ass smell that makes you wake af
Honey walnut shrimp please
0:45 Cornstarch plus what?
I just made the batter for the chicken but it was coming out a doughy consistency. so I added more water.
raw chicken on a wooden cutting board???????
3 am and I am watching this. What am I doing with my life.
Orange Chicken in Panda Express super Thumb Up👍👍👍👍👍👍
Orange chicken = Sheldon Cooper
i've never had orange chicken
What they show here is NOTHING like what they give at the restaurant.
Made this tonight.  It was excellent!  Note: Based on the recipe, there wasn't enough sauce to coat 2 lbs. of chicken.  Either use less chicken (1 lb.) or double the sauce.  I made 2 batches of sauce.
It's tasty....l made it so many time
1 cup of corn starch+3 cups of flour for 1 1/2 cup of water???!!! I think ure wrong about measurements... the batter is too thick
And yes, it’s way too much sugar.
Yes and technically the chicken was from China. The chicken was raise in the USA..lol.....that would actually mean that most of the international cuisines are American....
I don't get why he wouldn't take the fat off when cutting it?? Gross .
Is it goood?
I know this will sound really dumb, but what did you fry it in.
what kind of oil
I made this and it was really good. We made it two nights in a row it was so good
Pause at 2:47 or 2:46
Who else made this recipe exactly the way it’s shown? I follow it but thought that 1 1/2  Cups of Water is too little. The consistency of the batter was like a Pizza Dough! I ended up having to add another Cup, total of 2 1/2 Cups and it was just right consistency...
Why did they not cut the fat off?, I love Panda Express orange chicken but 🤮
I am vegan and put this on fried tofu! I died it is the exact sauce I missed.
could i use chicken breast
This came out really good!
you forgot the msg
Omg half a cup of sugar in just that!!??
Wtf thats not how panda express make orange chicken
"Chinese food"        hohohoho......
1:35 - No way to cheat (Asian) fast food?  Uh...  Did you just forget about or ignore MSG at that moment?
whoo hoo. Now I know what I'm making for dinner tomorrow. *tips Hat* Thank You Tasty
What did you do with the leftover chicken
I made this going off your recipe but I think the flour portion is off because I did as you said and the batter was as if it was for biscuits 😢 so I changed my method to battering it like if I was going to make fried chicken and that worked. Was weird not sure what happened. 😩
Actual Asian people know that at fast food Chinese places such as this it’s not real Chinese food. It’s Americanized, created by Americans.
2:02 Oobleck!
Perfecto !
Yummm
Too much flour, I suggest add flour a cup at a time until you get the consistency you want
Definitely making this!! I get it from Panda Express every time!! 😱😱😱😱😱
It looks sooo good
Pei wei Orange chicken or Panda Orange Chicken ??
orange chicken was not invented- origin by panda express it was invented by the chinese in the late 18th century known as general tso chicken, it was adopted as a dish in america as was many others when chinese people migrated to the us.
Wow. I kept seeing this reposted everywhere, so I finally decided to make it. I can't cook to save my life, and this actually tasted exactly like it!! although I'd probably double the sauce to make it more saucy. yum.
I just finished making this by following your recipe and method.. the taste is to die for.. thank you for sharing..
Oh wtf I’m supposed to be dieting 🙄😢
The funny thing is I never had the orange chicken when I was in China.
How much is a ½ cup in deciliter? idk like a cup just seems like a super vague unit of measurement
is there anything could be used to subsitute the brown sugar? it's really expensive here tbh 😂
I made this. Only change was to use rice vinegar. It came out exactly how I remember it.
Acidity*
Mouth watering.
Orange chicken is Chinese 🤔
I like this American dish
I have to find this restaurant. This looks so good.
I have to find this restaurant. This looks so good.
Why tf you lying ??? Lol you can see them at panda take the bags of frozen chicken, dump it in the deep fryer lol the only thing they ain’t cheating is the veggies. It still looks good though
I thought this was a how to basic video
Taehyungs quaking
Wow ...so easy❤
我就笑笑不说话 🤪
Would orange juice be better from concentrate or not from concentrate?
Excellent presentation of a most d'lightful receipe!  Thanks for sharing this amazinG and super easy to follow receipe!😄😘
All this to achieve a good "crunch" and still NO CRUNCH
He never mentioned what kind of oil to fry the chicken in..........duh
god bless
I feel like eating orange chicken. It makes me hungry! 🤤
Tasty please make a Recipe on Pandas Beijing Beef !!😋 😉☺️  and Walnut shrimp 🍤 thanx for this recipe 👏🏼👌🏼
OMMGGG I WWANNNTT😍😍
Panda Express is a disgrace to asain food
what kind of oil is usable for the recipe?
But did he clean the Chicken first, at least?
Literally the only reason to ever frequent a Panda Express!
thats one thing i love about chinese food or any asian food. they make great use of meat parts that otherwise people would not really use. like the dark meat. i just dont see americans making chicken nuggets out of dark meat.
Other question.....can you make the honey shrimp of panda express 😸?
Sorry for the question. Panda has for sale the Orange Chicken flavor sauce, when can I use the sauce when making the chicken? Or what do I replace it?
By god....its luks damn tasty...
I live in Australia so I don’t have any Panda Express restaurants near me, but now I want to go to one!
Thanks now I won't have to go to panda express no more
I literally just cooked this for my class project tomorrow and it turned out so great and taste amazing you really saved me 😊👍👋
I am definitely doing this!
I've never been to Panda Express😭
white people chinese food
Taehyungie will be very excited when he sees this video and might ask Jin to cook it for him😂
I want some
YUM
I did it and it tasted wonderful
Followed the recipe to the letter. 3 cups of flour and 1 cup corn starch with only one egg, 1 1/2 cups water and oil, didn’t seem enough. It turned into a dough. I used a measuring scoop too. I had to keep adding water to make it into pancake batter and even then it turned out lumpy still. Not sure what kind of “cup” They mean but 1 1/2 cup water definitely didn’t turn it into the consistency they had on the video idk. But the Orange sauce was on point and tasty though.
Ok I admit orange chicken taste good but as a Chinese native, orange chicken actually doesn’t exist in Chinese cuisine...?
I just love it
Did anyone else try this and have problems with the batter? Like I had the perfect measurements and it turned into a weird floury dough, nothing like a liquid at all 🤷🏼‍♀️ I doubled the water but in the end it turned out so good!
ps6 is gonna be awesome i just saw it
西檸雞
Just tried this. Yes it works and it's heaven!!!!!!!!
Did u just say.... jimin?
i can almost smell it
OMG I'm hungry asf
What is the brand of hot plate/burner  that the chef is cooking on?
Pro tip! If any of you are vegan or vegetarian and maybe miss orange chicken, cauliflower is an excellent replacement, or even tofu! ❤️
*out of nowhere* Taehyung: Panda Express  *Bts burst out laughing*  Suga: "Do you want it or buy it.."  Taehyung:"Los angelos bestest food" 😂😂😂😂
This makes me happy! I ate this everyday when I visited the US and have been craving this here back home in Australia 😭 time to get cooking!!
could you do this with beef
This is great cause I honestly can't afford Panda Express LOL
Recipes WhatsApp ok
Wow tasty wow wow very nice,
You forgot the part where you throw out the edible meat and only bread the chewy throwaway bits!
I dont like dark meat 🤮
OH YES
WANG LOL😲
chowmein orange chicen kung pao cheekan... yeehaww
You forgot the GMO😂😂😂
So I literally am trying this right now. I would like to say that when I tried making the batter the same way this guy did and all the same ingredients. Well with 1cup of corn starch and 3 cups of flour, when you add the 1 and a half cups of water it turns into a DOUGH. With that being said I'd use about another cup and half of water.
Dear Kim Taehyung now you can cook it on your own😂😂😂😂
It's basically swwet and sour
Panda Express is garbage.
I made this and it's very nice. I just added an extra cup of water to the batter.
Any army’s thinking of V?! 😂
Ur English is perfect. Can you speak another language?
That makes me so hungry 🍽
Damn, this is pure sugar!
Can anyone tell me if the panda express Orange sauce in the bottle has the same flavor as the cooked one?
Every time I go to panda I get a plate of fried rice and double orange chicken
The word ORIGINAL doesn't go well with Panda Express...
Yummyyy
yum
I love panda express this is what i get   Rice with veggies,noodles, orange chicken, teriyaki and chicken with stringbeans
That’s a very shit induction cooker u have there, u can see the heat pattern is badly spread
I use WAY MORE PEPPER
It looks like they cooked it on the floor lol
Panda? Not even once
OMG idk how i could survive college without panda express
Does anyone know of a good alternative to orange juice for this? Lemon? I might need to add a little sugar, though.
😤😤
taehyung says hello
Nop nop
No trimming the fat that's hanging at the ends ? Mmmmmm 'kay
Welp this is all I need, next time I have someone over they'll think I went to panda Express to buy orange chicken but they won't know that I'M THE COOK.
How to lose your job by giving away trade secrets 101
That might be one of their recipes throughout the years, but not the one you get at any Panda Express these days.
Too bad it's all frozen and made hours before you order it. It's a fast food chain, it will never be that good or fresh. Sadly.
My favorite
lol panda express aka shit food
I make the sauce separately with larger chunks of of ginger and garlic , add a little orange marmalade ( with rind ) and a little toasted cumin, and use a weak chicken stock instead of water, also whole red dried chilies with the seeds removed, then toss the chicken in to coat. Top with scallions and toasted peanuts  Also had takeout versions with slightly charred large orange peel pieces that added a subtle but nice note
1 1/2 cups of water is not enough to make the mixture into this batter for me? Am I missing something.
Hey you stupid fucks. It's not 3 cups of flour
M
God bless Panda Express
thank you
There's no chicken in their orange chicken! Are you fckin kidding me? It's some kind of filler or veggie meat.
This is Cat from  Brooklyn NY!🐱  First of all Panda Express is Americanized Chinese food! If you want real Chinese food go to a restaurant where they have meat hanging in the window and order a rice plate! I think Panda Express is absolutely horrible! By the time you get your drink and sit down your food is cold and hard! Ugh! I got their shrimp and the batter was falling off and the shrimp tasted like rubber!❤🍤🍗💕🍤🍗💝🍤🍗🗽🐅💖☄☮🐱
Wheres the Pei Wei chef that makes Wei Better Orange Chicken
really sorry but We don’t eat this back in China. Not really traditional Chinese food
Anyone knows about general Tao's🤔
Me and my grandma had just made this. Its delicious.
OMG panda express please come to Geneva!
No sound
I made it and it came out amazing yum
What if you're allergic to vinegar
https://youtu.be/vqXPEyEm9EY orange chicken vid
I'm starving... this is not a good video to watch!!!!!
No offence but Panda Express is basically white people’s interpretation of Chinese food 😕
TOO MUCH SUGAR  I made the sauce with half the amounts of everything and I added 1.5 tbsp of sugar and it still came out way too sweet.  When I make the recipe I usually add 1-1.5 tsp of sugar and it tastes just perfectly sweet.
Me salio exquisito.....
Orange chicken is gross
Iconic. This dish is a joke. Panda Express is a joke
Water to flour ratio is way way off
I’m hungry 😋
hi which orange juice to use...fresh one or box one?
i fucking love orange chicken and now im hungry for some super bad why did i watch this
salivating
This batter portion is totally out of wack. 4 cups of dry flours to 1.5cu water and 2Tsbp just made me a bread dough, not a batter.
It's Just amazing! ALL my family loved this Orange chicken today! Thanks!
Lord, now I want some. Thanks, Tasty. =\
Panda Express is never seeing me again lol
👍👌 I looks delicious!!!
There’s the lie right there - that is not 3 cups of flour. I followed the instructions and got the consistency of bread dough. 3 cups is waaay too much.
I made this and followed buzzfeed's recipe. All I've to say is cut down on the vinegar.... shit made me feel like I was in a chemistry lab
Not authentic Chinese. They *didn’t* even brown the garlic and ginger.
Final I can orange chicken right and not that school pale ass supposedly orange chicken wannabe
I followed the mix but instead turned into dough.. wtf!! Help please EDIT: i added some more water until it matched the consistency with the video EDIT 2: The sauce didn’t taste like the original sauce, of course, but I still liked it
I was annoyed when he used a fork, there were chop sticks in the thumbnail
So I tried making It and it taste sooooooo good. Its not Exactly the same but who can expect that.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
It works thank you 😊😊😊
Never heard of panda express

God this looks good af.....(I’m vegetarian use to be a meat eater but I don’t like how we eat animals...but it’s still so good whhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!! Dam I’ve been considering going back to eating sea food. I don’t think I’ll go back to eating mammals though. Like cows, chicken, pigs, etc)
Hmmmmm I really want to try this right now but I live in New Zealand and we don’t have Panda Express😭but we have Asian chicken and chips shops where they sell something that looks really similar it’s called sweet and sour chicken it’s so delicious 😋
Wasn't he on that pizza themed episode on chopped?
its soooo good. i always only get double orange chicken when i go.
I MADE THIS FOR DINNER! IT WAS DELICIOUS! THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE <3
So nice
What orange juice do you use? Do you use fresh?
panda express is TAEHYUNG'S fav , that's why I'm here . BTS😍😘
thigh meat salt white peper cornstarch flour egg water oil   veg oil chilli flakes ginger garlic sugar brown sugar orange juice  vinegar soy sauce water+cornstarc sesame oil
as a Chinese what the hell is orange chicken
Where’s the box of frozen chicken you find at Panda Express??
I always get the orange chicken at Panda Express
Where is the orange?
im having orange chicken tonight kekeke
I kinda want more of that sticky sauce. It will be dry to eat just chicken with rice.
Now do walnut shrimp.
Is the Orange juice regular sweet orange juice or unsweetened orange juice? I imagine it would be too sweet if we put in sweetened orange juice along with the sugar and brown sugar.
Has anyone tried this recipe?
Orange chicken isnt chinese food its american..
Buuuuuut it comes frozen in a bag
Too much suger
It always amazes me how many places do the entire recipe "authentic".. but then use breast meat when most Chinese cuisine uses THIGH MEAT.  LOL
The rice from Panda isn’t cooked enough 😔
This summer i have been in the usa for the first time and i loved panda express’s food, specially this chicken... so good!
*Good lord* that's a lot of sugar.
Woooowww my mouth is droooling
Great way to turn something as healthy as chicken into a pan of diabetes and obesity. GJ
Well now I want Chinese food
Has anyone tried this recipe? Does it come out exactly like the original? Is it any good?
I wish I could make this but I am not allowed to...
Wow. Cool make
OMG, all my prayers have been answered! God Bless your soul for a thousand lifetimes for this video!
واوووو جميل
The Truth now, I made this tonight, cut the recipe in half and added less sugar than needed, the dish was way too sweet, not enough spice, tart or salt to counter balance it. I suggest to cut the sugar completely, add honey to darken the colour and add flavour. Add the cornflour directly in the orange juice, and add a hint of MSG in both the chicken batter and the sauce.
Tmw you work at a Panda Express and you're just saying this is a lie!!!
Mistake number one. Sharing your secrets to the orange chicken.
I've been to East Asian countries, heck I live in Asia, never heard of a dish called orange chicken...
Congratulations. I'm never going to Panda Express again. I'm making it at home from now on 👏🏾👏🏾
como se ase el can pow chickem del panda
When he said “Panda Express” I immediately think of Tae=))
This dish reminds me of Sheldon cooper in the first season of TBBT
So yummy
MouthWatering!!!!!
Taehyung's gonna love this💖🌺
Where's the Beijing Beef recipe?
What’s ap flour
Thats how I feed my eel

PANDA EXPRESS IS LIFEEEEE
Army where are you?
Wow deja vu lmao.... 😂😂

Love it i wanna make it
Taehyung will like this
Can i replace red pepper flakes with red chili?
Made this with fresh squeezed orange juice and zest, was amazingly good.
When I first saw “Panda Express” I immediately thought of V🤣

I suddenly remembered V😆

Binging with Babish, is that you?

This is Taehyung's favorite video in the internet.
*My babyboy Taehyung was the first thing that popped in my head when I saw this in my recommendations. lol*
finally, tasty is now speaking😂
So weird how this video got posted right when I was trying to find a recipe to make orange chicken! Lol it was meant! imma try this recipe for sure!! Thank u!
I LOVE TALKTHROUGH TASTY VIDEOS DO MOOOORE!!!
Just make it  Don't be a      Chicken
My brother and I practically live off of Panda Express, so when I saw this video I clicked the fastest I've ever clicked on a video before. 😂
Knock off Chinese food courts, start cooking 😆
Aahhhh I haven't had breakfast and it's already like lunch I'm so hungry
1976.  16.   BRAPP.   +16. MARTA HERSH.   RIP.  EAT. SM.  PANDA.  canyonlocalfilmscom
The restaurants are supplied with chicken nuggets and pre made sauce that they briefly toss the nuggets in before serving. If you believe this is what youre actually going to be served at a Panda Express there's no helping you lol
so so tasty yum
Yes this is TOTALLY authentic Chinese food
Umm they sell the sauce lol no need to make it
This is a simple for us Chinese heheheh
What happened to the "OH HO HO YES" part
Btw orange chicken isnt chinese at all, give this to a chinese person they will be like wtf
Anyone else notice how he put oobleck or however you spell it on the sauce or whatever @2:04
Incredible. This is the most innovative fast food marketing I've yet to see.
He didn’t use chopsticks I’m **T R I G G E R E D**
I miss panda express bbq pork :'(
I love Panda Express!
When you actually think about attempting it😂
Pls do the general tao plsssss
Can you do #TeamPeanutButter vs. #TeamNutella?
I worked at a Panda express. The chicken is prepackaged and nasty when refried
I'm sure it's delicious but a lotta work. Hello take out ! !
I love panda express!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😚😙😙😐😘
Why the re-upload?
Who doesnt like the orange chicken... i like kung pu and Beijing beef
Is there a way to make a vegetarian version? A youtuber out there needs to make a series called "Make it veggie" where they take recipes and make it vegetarian friendly
저도 주세요..
Is #buzfeedvideo your channel?
Tasty we already seen this video lol yaw should had another dish like steak n peppers 😅
y'all know what I'm doing for dinner
Except their chicken is  way smaller than one inch and there's hardly any meat in there
Did anyone think this was food wishes?
Is orange chicken in the US spicy? Cause in their recipes they always put chilli flakes in  In my country it isn't spicy at all
Who is hungry .
In the end, I totally expected him to use chopsticks instead of a fork #AmericanizedChineseFood
Making this on the weekend
i dont live in america & we dont have this where i am from but i've tried it when i went there. i'm badly craving for panda now i'm so sad
Thank you for the video, panda express is my favorite reataurant!
Mr. why u put oil to flour? Sorry, i'm amateur LOL
I don’t think I’ve ever had anything else other than orange chicken and lo mein at PE
V: (watches video) V: (walks up to Jin) V:(holds phone with the recipe) V: please  Jin: why well u little...........
I loved this sort of documentary-style, artsy type video!
You should make calamari
I'll try this
Wow my dream came true....for my birthday....yassss🎂🎂❤️
I’m gonna record it this time.
Tasty! 😋
Omg this looks so good
Hello welcome to panda............. panda express in america the cook there chicken in a wong
Nice!
Does this taste somewhat like the actual orange chicken?
Aww Shoot! It's on now
Dang I knew Panda Express was really popular but I didn’t know it was THIS popular. THEY INVENTED ORANGE CHICKEN? BLESSSS 😍  I really wanna go to Panda Express one day 💕
If you want chinese food do not go to Panda Express the food not tasty 😞
I was literally just talking about making orange chicken. I have been using a copycat recipe but now I have the real deal. And conveniently a ton of chicken thigh
time to make this for dinner
WAIT THERE’S SESAME OIL IN ORANGE CHICKEN??? IM ALLERGIC TO SESAME SEEDS OH SHIT LOL
I’m Chinese but Americanized Chinese food is great I love orange chicken so much.
Definitely going to try this thank you!👍👍
Orange chicken is the shame of Chinese
PLEASE MAKE ON ABOUT THE CHOW MEIN PLEASE
TaeTae is watching this
You're actually spot on except we use orange extract. - Panda Cook
You are quickly becoming my new BFF (snicker)
Yes that looks great chat wait to make it!!! :)
bts is shook
deep fried + sugar ?!?!? oooh hell NO!!!!
I have a question : Anyone got an alternative to frying stuff ? Cause they always seem to fry a whole damn lot in Tasty recipes, and while it does look appetizing using that technique is kind of a pain because it first off all ain't that easy and it makes your whole place smell like oil if you have an open kitchen. I know the end result will obviously not be the same without the frying part, but I'd be nice if I could do recipes like this one still. So if anyone could help I'd be grateful. :p
I went to panda express when I was like 4, and don't even remember what it tasted like...
Dang didnt realize how truly unhealthy this shit was until i saw all the ingredients. And btw i just farted
Can’t wait to make this! The orange chicken is my favorite!
The mushroom chicken is my junk.
I think the Beijing beef is the best! Can we get a video on that?!?!
This was past posted for like 30 minutes about a month ago and then taken down immediately, never got to see it until now. I wonder what happened
all i know about panda express is that bts its loves it
First off Panda Express fucking sucks ( The one in Florida and Virginia make disgusting imitations of Chinese food)  Second Tasty is a fiend for views. You all upload the same shit just to get more money. Unsubscribing from the mainstream bullshit.
العاب يل😂😂😂😂
chicken thigh meat is cheap and sucks!!!
Finally I know how to make Orange Chicken
I wish I never watched this. Now I’m craving orange chicken . 🤤🤤
So....what about the rest of the chicken pieces...
Looks amazing!....why he chewing like that😆😆
Like this comment if u love orange chicken
so much sugar
I'm making this to my husband right now lol
Thank you for putting this back Tasty. I had it saved in my favorites and then the next min it was gone
Dam
Sugar chicken. Fuckin hell America
you can see how shitty is your cooker when youre making the sauce its only boiling the middle
Isnt this reuploaded
When your own recipe has not enough sause for the chicken 😂
nice cheff
Chinese food is the opposite of technical. It’s basically throw everything into a wok and dump in a can of MSG.
YUM
someone make this for me and deliver it to me
Rice Balls!!!
I've not tried orange chicken but every Chinese restaurant in the UK has Lemon Chicken and I love it.
YESSS MY FAVORITE FOOD
American Chinese food
Hey there ! I watched a lot of tasty videos. 😄👍 Just want to call attention to my recipes. I don't tell stories about my recipes, but they are simple and healthy! 👀✌🏻↙️ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtTLHkT4OXTjj7YRMb4u0Iw
This is what BTS goes crazy for loll
中餐垃圾
Is so good
I'm surprised he used a fork instead of chopsticks at the end lmao.
Orange chicken is my favorite
Why does the pan only heat up in the middle
So is there a way to go gluten free with this?  Obviously  substituting the a.p flour but what would  be the best sub for it
Wow thats just the kind of recipe i needed
Orange chicken was invented in china. The founder of Panda express said their orange chicken is just a variation of General Tso's chicken. Which is the what we know it to be in America.
Please do actual Indian food next! Not blended by other cultures!
Tasty talks now?
Yeah... they just put frozen chicken into a deep fryer and top it off with their bottled orange sauce 🙄
it really gets me annoyed when people pronounce their own name wrong
this is fucking awesome :)
Army's gonna come .
I LUB PANDA EXPRESS
PLEASE DO KUNG PAO CHICKEN
“Original creator” of orange chicken? Lol ok, if that’s a fact cool, but they didn’t master it because they’re orange chicken is trash !
The chicken looked SO sexy the way it was poured on to the plate 2:32
basically batter in pancake mic,then continue with rest of the process
“Acilaly”
Panda Express sucks
For some reason my batter came out really dry and needed more water. Was there a typo or something?
Orange Chicken is Great!
PANDA EXPRESS IS SO GOOD!!!!
No MSG? Sure......
Sounds and looks good.
Tae
Do prank foods
Thank you so much! I was in the US and ate this orange chicken, and  when I got back home all I could think about is what I'll do without it! This is like a dream come true, so thank you very much😁
Actually what I need
Not exactly authentic but still pretty "Tasty"!
“Chinese food is very technical” my chinese dad just puts in some salt, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, etc. and says “hey that looks about right”. bam. chinese food
I'm still waiting for the Haitian patties (pate kode)
Bruh orange chicken isn’t even Chinese food...
Im glad they put this video back up
wig flew
This why you don't fire your chef .
Yessssss
Thank god! Now I can make this at home with chicken that’s actually good quality
Finally brought this video back. Please dont delete again.
Maybe spend some time getting your fried rice recipe to not be dogshit Panda Express.
I only get the Shanghai angus beef and walnut shrimp when I go to Panda.🐼😋
I never had Panda Express but for what I know it’s not authentic Chinese food
IF ONLY WE HAD PANDA EXPRESS IN ENGLAND
YEAH HE ESPERADO ESE VIDEO POR SEMANAS :DDDD
Yesssss FINALLY 😊
Hmm looks tasty! 😋
V from Bts startin to get notes cuz he mentioned he likes Panda Express😂😏👌🐼
Panda Express is nasty af 🙅🏻‍♂️
they're giving away their secrets!
You have no idea how happy this makes me Me and my bff have been apart for 4 years now due to my father beige in the army. When I made it to my new house, she called me and now it's an everyday thing to FaceTime eachother once a day. One time when we were talking, we both were amazed to figure out both our favorite food was orange chicken and rice (with tater tots). It became a little joke between to say 'when we're together again, the first food we'll have together will be orange chicken and rice! (With tater tots of course).' Today my dad announced he got hired back in her area and that we're moving back. I can't wait to surprise her with this the day I see her again (hopefully soon ;D).
닭강정아니야?
Tasty has gotten lazy man. Reloading videos
Next their fried rice please!!
It's all about that SWEET FIRE CHICKEN!! We need that sauce recipe please!
Do Beijing beef
Taehyung (BTS) should watch this XD
يمي
Instructions weren’t clear my oranges still taste the same
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE BTS IS STARTING TO TAKE NOTES ON HOW TO MAKE THIS RN?
i love when u use ginger an garlic to cook
David has to try this
Orange chicken was around way before 87
Nice
Orange chicken is what we call it, it's not that good tbh, it doesn't rhyme for me.
FINALLY!!!!
I've only been to Panda Express a few times, cuz every time I go, the food is really dry. Better fast Chinese Food in my town.
Too bad the Panda Express in Canada is not very good.
Now all they need to do is do the Lo Mein and i'm set!
Does anyone think you can do this with tofu or sumn
I waited for this recipe, it looks so delicious <3
He expressed even before the chicken touches his toung.
Hey everytime I try to cook boneless chicken, it ends up being chewy. Can you help me? Thanks.
BEST TASTY VIDEO
Panda Express? Never been there. Well, I've never had Chinese food before either
Panda express is nasty af. They just opened in my town right in front of a local chinese restaurant that has been there a long time. Im thinking "awesome! this will be just like when chick- fil-a came to town and took chicken sandwiches to a whole new level for me".....WRONG - I tried the panda express from a grand opening coupon they mailed us ...even the most basic thing sold at a chinese restaurant: their fried rice, was super soggy, nasty pale looking color and  bland as hell.....and the beef dish i tried was tiny as hell, smaller than a child's portion would be,  and I  couldnt even chew half the "steak" pieces.......AND their regular prices are more than the local restaurant....yet they'll likely put them out of business just because of the popular name, drive through, and fancier looking place even though their food (at least at that particular place on that day) was shit.  Such a shame.
It’s very hard to go to Panda and NOT order orange chicken. Thanks for the recipe!! 😊👨‍🍳👍
who's here beacause of BTS??? XD
Do you know what this did to me?       It just made me hungry
Ugh panda express orange chicken is the best
Chinese food that does not exist in China. Funny.
can anyone try this so i know it works?
Can you make the sauce without vinegar?
They have chicken in the Orange Chicken ??? When I eat orange chicken at Panda Express, all I get is the batter.
They sell the orange sauce at Wal-Mart. You're welcome! 😎😎
now i can make it at home! and don't have to go out and buy ;D
Omg THANK YOU FOR THIS.
sure jan
Yum.
He just put his own company out of business.  EDIT: guys it's a joke. Companies obviously don't go out of business this way. 😂😂 I probably should have been more clear on that
Is this  reupload?
I love & miss orange chicken!! I wish Chinese restaurants/takeaways would serve orange chicken in Ireland😢
I follow you in Pinterest. How easily you did this👍
Ew Tf theres so much oil in this
now I’m hungry
Why are Americans so Obsessed with Orange chicken?
Now do Bejing Beef :)
Yum!
90
This is literally the best video ever.
I luv Panda Express. - Kim Taehyung
or go to panda express (whatever that is) and buy it
Panda's orange chicken is my favorite thing to eat. I'd eat it everyday if I could
Congrats tasty on 6 million subs!!!
Taehyung gonna ask seokjin to watch this and make it for him at the dorm.
Hi, person scrolling down the comments. Hope you have a great day! I am just a regular teenager who has recently started a cooking channel. Tasty's really great but I hope you will give my channel a chance. Thank you!
I’m sure it doesn’t taste like his orange chicken 😒
Chicken: I’m a free range....       Orange: I am O’range :)
Which flour is used?
Panda Express is pure shit...
Yeah, Panda Express's chicken is definitely made with flour, salt, orange juice, eggs, etc. There's definitely no sodium benzoate or high-fructose corn syrup or other weird shit in it. Sure, Jan.
I want this now
Yummy!!
Didn’t know Panda Express invented orange chicken
This is sweet shit
Oh I love Panda E
make Arabic shakshouka
They forgot the MSG
You need a new cutting board.
*DON'T MIND BUT THIS GUY HAS BABY HANDS!* 😂
What about the rest of the leftover fried chicken?
How to make crack
Really nice of them to share their secret recipe!
Always got to get Orange Chicken when you go to Panda!
The orange chicken at panda express has filling, it's not 100% chicken, what is this
And people say Panda Express isn't real chinese
