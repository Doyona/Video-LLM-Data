Love your  hummingbird  cake. I will try and let you know  how  well  I do. Thank you
Just made this for the first time and it’s a hit!!  Come back. We miss you 😢
Love it ty❤
omggggg im g Going to try this recipe wish me luck I just have a question what size is the baking circle that you used is it 8 inch? 😊
Gotta make this cake for Mother's Day 2023!
You put salt in it right ? Cause that adds a kick
This is the best way I’ve seen this done. I messed up two times watching others who did it differently. You put all wet together then sifted dry into it and saved the big chunky stuff for last. Plus you drained the pineapple. My first cake was so wet it fell through. My second was so dry we through it out. But yours worked first time.
I'm thinking of turning this into a carrot cake 😬

Mmmm your recipe looks delish!  I’d love to make this recipe but when I go to your website and click on the recipe it keeps redirecting me to the blueberry lemon pound cake 🤷🏻‍♀️
my fave cake
This cake was so delicious! Thanks for the amazing recipe! 👏☺🖤
Been making this for my mom’s birthday every year for the past 3 years. She now refuses to have any other cake on her special day 😂
I am diabetic, can I replace the sugar with applesauce?
I made this cake and my family LOVES it 🥰‼️ Thanks
Nice work Carolyn... Instructions were so easy to follow and understand ... It's been years since I've had Hummingbird Cake... I so look forward to making this amazing recipe 😎 - Warren

Thank you so much for sharing it
Hi! I have just made your sour cream-blueberry cake (which was absolutely amazing) and I am realizing that the baking time and temperature was very different from this one. I wonder what determines the baking time and temperature. I was going to try to turn that cake into muffins. Do I need higher temperature and shorter time when I reduce the size? Thank you for the videos!!!
Wow!! Delicious cake thank you for your recipe it really looks good and delicious😋😋😋😋🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼😋🍰
Im making this tomoro, kinda nervous that my family wojt like the pineapple and bannana combo, wish me luck!

Hello Carolyn I’m making this cake for tomorrow. Will it taste the same if I bake it today and refrigerate it? Or should I do it all the same day?

I made this cake for Easter 2017.  It was everything Ms. Carolyn promised.  WONDERFUL!!!
Hi Carolyn, If I am using three 10 inch cake pans is it safe to say that I should double your recipe?
I'm so glad I found you I love your style
Hello, I was wondering if this cake would work with some raisin and dates?

Ms. Carolyn this cake looks awesome! my family don't like nuts but I do, sooooo I gust I'll have to make it and take it to church. maybe I trying to loss weight pray for me lol.
Looks Great :)
I have always wondered what Hummingbird cake was, leave it to good ole Carolyn to educate me!
When you used the fork to pick up a piece of cake my mouth was open - I forgot where I was.
Hunty, this looks deelish!  I don't normally do layer cakes, 'cause for me they are a plain pain. But for this this I might have to make an exception.  LOL  I wonder though, if I could just dump it in a tube or bundt and squeeze out the frosting drizzle style, the way you did in that red velvet cake?
Yum!! Looks Devine!!!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😽😽💕💕

Does this taste like banana bread with pineapple??
YES Please!!  looks so good!!  Perfect in time for mother's day.  I can make my mom a beautiful hummingbird cake.  Thank you for posting!
Can this be made in a 9 by13 inch pan like a sheet cake or is it better as a layered cake? It looks awesome!
Yummy!
I initially thought this was a carrot cake at first from the thumbnail. Can you do a carrot cake, please 😊thank you for sharing this recipes.
Hi Carolyn, Should I use overripe bananas for this recipe?  I'm going to make it for my mom for Mother's Day.
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Looks so good but what if I don't want to add nuts? do I add extra banana or will that make it too moist like the pineapple would? I didn't see any substitutions on the written recipe? just wondering and thank you for you wonderful videos, making me break my diet as always! lol.
This looks fantastic...cant wait to try. Will this recipe make nice cupcakes? have you tried it in cupcakes? Thanks!
I only bake sheet cakes - how would I adjust the cooking time? Thanks.
Oh help me somebody that cake looks so good, I bet it gets more tasty everyday!
Right along with the Moscato pound cake!
GIRL!!!   You know i love you!!!  I'm already getting my Thanksgiving menu in order and THIS WILL be apart of the menu!
