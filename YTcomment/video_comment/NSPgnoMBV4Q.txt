Nice
They look amazing…
This makes the best EB! I highly recommend this method. Delicious!!!!
Girl, you can't leave that black pepper just sittin there, lonesome.  Also, my goodness she's beautiful.  She's princess pretty.
Both the vortex method of poaching eggs and straining off the outer albumen (the thin part of the egg white) are aiming for the same goal: to make the eggs more presentable and recognizable as cooked eggs on the plate by either eliminating the thin egg white via straining or wrapping the thin egg white tightly around the thick egg white via the vortex method so the appearance of the poached eggs is much more uniform. Therefore, if one chooses to use the straining method to remove the thin egg white there is no real point in also using the vortex method.
Amazing but little known fact: There is a technique for cooking foods in water at a temperature just below simmering temperatures, and it is called, wait for it..., wait for it..... (drumroll please...) poaching! WHEEEEEEE!!!!!!
Strainer mesh too large. Lol. Much easier professional large accommodating method 😂
Dont make me watch a 3:15 Tshirt commercial. You just go my first thumbs down ever. Skipped.
Molly was fired because of her white skin.  Truth.
you could have made the hollandaise properly and saved it for later... and those eggs are more like raw yolk then poached eggs... mayb this is a new recipe all together but not eggs beni sry
Still surprised by the number of people that do not know how to make this using a microwave and a hand mixer.  Takes 3 mins and its perfect.  See the NOLA cookbook Tout de Suite a la Microwave.  Been doing this for decades, its spot on perfect.
🙏✝️👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Brad and molly? 🤭
If ya don't like lemon go with vinegar.
I miss these old days.
That girl is mad pretty.
You could pass for Dakota Johnson’s sister.
Molly is probably my favorite chef to watch.
Most of America -  eating a cup of noodles Brad - no to an Eggs Benedict by a professional chef. ok
Wow!
Unsalted butter?
You can tell how many of these cooks actually have worked in a professional restaurant.
I like to use scissors to fine slice my ham so it's always good no matter what kind of ham I use. Also, I think an immersion blender is better than a mixer because it's easier to clean.  Great video!
Salmon bennedict
so awesome, thank you
Very great video, thank you a lot!
My favorite is smoked salmon instead of the ham.
She's firm!  I like her
Thanks will definitely try.
She didn’t stir it after adding salt and cayenne. Why?
Is there a spice that can be used rather than cayenne? For some reason I never have cayenne in the house when I need it 😂
Wet hollandaise
Definitely brunch-able
Thank you for the egg poaching technique! It saves me so much time!
I love Molly. That. I've said it!
Quick question - was the melted butter warm when you added to egg yolks and lemon juice?
👏👏👏👏👏
This was totally badass
Everything but the deli-meat ham 🤢
This video is so Molly and I’m here for it
For a moment I thought she was going to use the microwave to hear the eggs back up
This chick is among the more annoying Youtubers.
Thank you! 🌞
Looked this up as I'm making these tomorrow, sounds like some great tips....Gracias
Amateur HR
Tried this and it was an epic fail because if your blender isn’t narrow towards the bottom, the yolks won’t blend right and the sauce will be ruined, we had a large blender and didn’t realize it, but also putting all the eggs together in a bowl before poaching broke the egg whites or something so even though we gently poured them into the simmering water it would turn into white egg soup. This seems easy but I think there’s more skill and knowledge involved here.
molly is the cutest chick ever
Ok now the blender is a life saver other than using the whisk
Not cooking the egg yoks was a deal breaker for me
We've come this far with the butter sauce, we're not gonna hold back now.  I know that feeling.
Brad is such a party pooper...he's a bit rude to his co-worker in many videos.
Molly you are the best....
The dishes are too fatty... I wish they could cook something healthy once in a while🤣
Dummy said, “not really..... “
Save yourself the trouble and put your hollandaise in a thermos.....it stays  "warm" for 3-5 minutes in a glass bowl, 3-5 hours in a thermos
My hollandaise didn’t turn out and my heart is broken
Sauce isn't cooked.  Blah
I love the casualness of this video! Them eating the eggs benedict afterwards!! Love it.
I honestly wished you would have fried the ham a bit. Pound of bacon all cross hatched and cut into portions mmmmm
She came off as quite bitter sour and tart at the beginning. I understood that dude was speaking too loud but it’s like -*- OK teacher “Molly whatever”—— the flip channel this is {?!?} OK teacher Molly you’re teaching we get it we must all obey !! CMON.. STFU!   You’re an embryo so I don’t know if you should even be handling a flame
I want to marry her...she knows how to really cook.  :)
The impossible weapon unfortunatly comb because pest conventionally note circa a energetic periodical. highfalutin, efficient picture
Thank you for sharing your method of making hollandaise. Now I don’t have to go out and buy a stand-up blender.
Molly, smoked salmon is awesome as well
Molly 👍💋
Brad hates women
I've always made my hollandaise sauce this way. Except I use hot butter to cook and have warm sauce
i came here for micheal afton content and found this-       i mad i want my eggs benedict
This channel is finished
she's a beauty
We are literally cooking Micheal Afton
I don't get why there are so many haters on this post, this is my go to instructional for eggs bene.
I miss the old crew
Molly is soooo professional and soooo pretty and sooo nice. I love her!
If you have an old fashion electric stove with coils, then you don't need a double boiler to cook hollandaise or chocolate. The settings on these stove stop electric ranges can produce heat much lower than can be found on a gas oven. All you really need is a good heavy bottom sauce pan and the lowest heat setting and you're good to go.
Brad – what a charmer. Wouldn't fly in 2020, lucky for him!
Hollandes without vinegar!!!😳 Is they even legal???
first: put the eggs in an ice bath second: reheat the eggs for 1 min me: uhuh got it
Prosciutto instead of "Canadian bacon" makes Eggs Benedict like an order of magnitude more delicious. And unless you are making Eggs Woodhouse, you don't even need to break out the snazzy good stuff. Because of all of the flavors involved in this dish, the cheaper domestic prosciutto works perfectly fine.....Man I wish I had some prosciutto right now...maybe some crackers...a few cornichon pickles.....damnit, I'm going into charcuterie withdrawal!!! Please, someone, send help!...and mortadella!!
Love Canadian bacon.  Being a Canadian.   Delish bacon
Playback speed is a great addition.  Hollindaise eggs are NOT cooked or tempered? Wow!
No clarified butter???
Eggs Benedict...  assemble!
I was going to try this until I saw that once it sat off to the side for awhile it seemed to loose its thickness.
Also, I require Canadian bacon for true EB experience
Still seems complicated  and out of my skill set: i leave benny to restaurants
There is something very pleasant about Molly.
Actually it is raw egg
Let’s see her on a restaurant line, she would get destroyed.
If you have no access to blander, the easiest way to make hollandaise sauce is just simmer butter with a dash of saffron and add it to egg yolk little by little while you are whisking it. No blender, no double boiler, voila. I find duck egg way better than chicken egg.
This girl has some mean streak on her
Fun fact: The ratio of butter to egg for hollendaise varies wildly between recipes, even on this website.  • On the most conservative side, Andrew Rea of Binging with Babish used 1 stick of butter for 4 eggs, so 0.25 or 1/4 • Moving up, Joshua Weissman used 1.5 sticks of butter for 4 eggs, so 0.375. • Molly here uses 2.25 sticks of butter for 3 eggs, so 0.75 or 3/4 of a stick of butter per egg • J. Kenji Lopez-Alt takes the most extreme path with 1 stick of butter per egg  Personally, I think the sweet spot is half a stick/quarter cup of butter per egg. No one asked, but my personal recipe is two egg yolks, two teaspoons of dijon, two teaspoons of lemon juice, two teaspoons of water, and a quarter teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Edit: oh yeah, and about an 8th if a teaspoon of salt obviously.  It's really kinda hard to screw up hollendaise imho
America's Test Kitchen's recipe is better and easier, especially for a large batch. No blender needed.
She’s was so rude to Brad. But I like the blender idea lol
I just made a video on eggs Benedict 3 ways. It’s secretly a lot better than this hehe. But still, great video!
What if you hate runny eggs can you just leave it in longer so the yolk cooks all the way through or will the whites get rubbery?
Hmmm she's rude I'm out I've seen better VIDEOS
Molly looks old enough to be running for class president at her high school.
I don’t like how he said to brad pipe down
Does the melted butter still need to be hot when you pour it in?
Brad, what a tool.
Molly made it look so easy. Gonna try her method after I screwed it up on Mother’s Day. Thanks Molly
Mustangs: Really heavy breathing*
We are filming "so" i lost i little respect for brad
Mollys glowing
Made this for me mum today. MAssive hit.
So I arrived in this comment section 2 years late as everyone still believed that Brad is an asshat Like....how? Dude is like what I expected a gentle giant looked and behaved
I can teach you how to make paratha and kheema and masala omelette, which is the best breakfast in my city Hyd.
I use oil instead of butter, I reckon that's THE easiest way
Do the yolks in the hollandaise suace not need to be cooked? Salmonella?
Stressing me out that she doesn't have her hair tied back.
Professor de gastronomia me manda assistir este video pra aprender, e eeu acado me apaixonando
The sauce never thickens for me, why could this be?
What kind of ham was that? It looked delicious and high quality.
Test kitchen apron - 150$   Wut.
How hot is this girl?
You have the best recipe and you're also  the fastest !!♡!!
Blender Hollandaise looks good, but tastes terrible. Period. If my chef catches me making that sauce in a blender, I'll for sure get fired on the spot... lol
Just made this it was delicious! Made it for one but still great!!!
molly had rbf this whole video
Love the instruction by have a hard time with the 'hipster' presentation...
“Vortex isn’t necessary” **Carla stares with menacing eyes**
I’d eat that.         😏
Most annoying voice of all time.  Oh and you destroyed that hollandaise with too much salt.  Cayenne goes in the sauce not on the egg. Otherwise a mediocre video.
Never knew it was possible to be aggressive” with eggs....
She must have a very happy husband
I have no idea whom this chick is, but she strikes me as the Gottfried Leibniz of cooking.
When molly still loves using the word "yield". Drink everytime she says it
What does she mean "vortex"? Sous vide?
For a crowd of one
Molly and Carla are my favorite Chefs on this channel.❤️❤️❤️
So...no white wine?
Molly is fast becoming a favorite...
Molly, you are so lovely!
Okay but why do I need a hair tutorial for Molly’s curls here 😭
536 people actually tried this recipe and were very disappointed
I don’t mind spending rest of my life with her
Traditionally, Eggs Benedict is also made with an English crumpet, not an English Muffin.
❤️Love Molly ❤️
Very rude
Wasting egg whites is a lazy technique.
It’s interesting how different everyone in test kitchen look now compared to a couple years ago...
Does anyone know the amounts to use to scale down this hollandaise sauce to a one person recipe (1 or 2 eggs benny)
I just made this for the first time today after watching this video. Turned out great! Maybe a little less lemon juice next time though.
FYI ... putting the sauce into a thermos keeps it perfectly warm until you serve it.
Brad didn't want them cause he's got beef with Ben
Awesome, a beautiful lady knows her way in the kitchen, and make it perfect with Molly.
F*k'n Molly Baz! You Rock!
Jan 2020 ... geeeeez Molly is there anything you can't dooooo????? Yuuuuuummm AND how good is that ice cold bath???
When did she add lemon juice to the sauce ?
Outstanding!
Brad didn't want any because he was told to shut up haha
who has guests for breakfast
I need to make this. Looks delicious!
I can tell she's a fan of Kenji Lopez Alt
I wanna marry Molly
I would put my eggs in her Benedict
I LOVE Eggs Benedict, but have been afraid to make them until now. Thank you, Molly, for a wonderfully presented and informative presentation.
Trump 2020
I will probably never make eggs Benedict for a crowd but Molly is a delight
That comfort level with a poached egg
I want that whole platter RN
Molly is really good in handling her anxiety. I literally watch her videos before my interview, it serves as a validation for me that it's actually possible to calm down your nerves. So satisfying to see how easy she makes it look like. Her breathing gets a lil weird though at times, almost like she's gasping, but obviously I am being a jerk now cause regardless she does a great job
Her skills at cooking is up there with how pretty she is.....
Awww when Molly was a baby!
Milky I’m totally stealing oh jeez Louisiana by the way
« I believe in a gentle poach » now that’s a religion I can get behind.
Yes! gentle poaching crewwwdem
I think you could definitely do that without the ice bath/reheating of the eggs. Just do the muffins first, then the hollandaise, then the eggs, quickly warm the ham and then you're done!?
Nobody: Molly: We're going to add a good amount of salt to that
So no need to cook the yolks?
Also you can poach in shell using a sude vide :)
That is not hollandaise
Molly and Claire are the baes of the kitchen
This cook is terrible! Please bring in Ray Charles. ``Canadian bacon'' wtf.  Canadians call ``bacon'' bacon and ``ham'' ham. Next thing you know she gonna call burgers ``liberty sandwiches'' and French fries ``potato chips''
Rewatching this now, I like Molly more.
The fresher the egg, the less loose white you have, which is what you're straining out. As an egg gets older the loose white gets bigger.
Brad wanted EGGS VINNY not benny
How do you keep the sauce warm by the stove? ?
MollY
molly's husky sick voice 😍
Why does it look like her mouth is moving weirdly when she's talking?
So this is her first debut video for BA kitchen series?
"That little bit of lemon makes all the difference."   That little bit of lemon is crucial to hollandaise... Not only is it the proper way, but it helps make the raw egg safer the same way it does in ceviche...
I never had eggs Benedicts
I CAN FINALLY BE THE QUEEN OF BRUNCH!!!
What’s the difference between hollandaise and mayo?
Molly please marry me
I'm just gonna say it...this eggs Benedict is for cucks....way to much drama
Cooking not drama.
no one wants to taste Molly's food lol
So the sauce is raw?
People in the BA test kitchen didn’t even appreciate! Those looked soooo good!!!
Thank you!
Molly is so pretty 😍
Can I do that in my stand mixer?  I don't have a Vitamix.
"Brad? We're filming." "So?"
i might be missing something but why is reheating the eggs for 1 minute easier than cooking them for 2 or 3 ?
My mom taught me the blender trick. So great
Heresey! Ham? Blender? This woman needs to go back to school. This is the kind of food you get in a restaurant. We’re better than that.
the title made me think she was gonna make them in front of a live studio audience lmao
I can’t believe moz shortens everything but lousiannaaaa haahha cute.
Mmmm I love long strands of hair in my breaky.
Geez Louisiana??? Never heard of that
I'd say egg bennies are the most overated item in brunch menu.
Mmmm yummy
I don’t think brad was being a jerk i just think he didn’t want any everyone there is probably offered tons of food everyday so he just said no
Very easy. A piece of cake. Their name is also easy ;)
If you add white vinegar to your poaching water it will help the egg whites coagulate around the egg yolk helping it from over cooking and not looking like a hockey puck.  Also always season your poaching water with some salt.  It just makes sense.
She looks sooo   British
was this molly's first video or something? the peanut gallery of the comments section seems to imply that.  - also, used to cook brunch, eggs benny and poached eggs was super popular, wish i had this trick up my sleeve back then, would have made the hectic rush much easier if i had a bowl of cold soft poached eggs waiting to be ordered. damn!
Not trying to put too much of a dark slant on things but if this lady was to disembowel a rabid Chernobyl crossbreed I would no doubt be as transfixed and enchanted by her adorable manner, in working through such a gruesome process, as I have been with every one of her other video offerings. Also,  thanks for the wisdom re Benny eggs
might be the only decent looking person they got in that kitchen
Jeez brad
Mine were too watery what I do wrong lol
Jeez Louisiana.
Any tips on subbing the butter for somebody who’s lactose intolerant?
Is she the sister of Yale guy from the Try Guys? Because she has the same mouth and nose.
Love the recipes Molly! Thank you, very easy to understand directions.
How about SousVide the eggs it will be easier to have them warm all the time.
Molly reminds me of my mom!  Love you!
Is she from Louisiana?
Is it wrong that I'm totally in love with Molly? Sigh...sorry.
my Hollandaise recipe is, 8 yolks, 1 lbs butter (clarified) with a 1/4 tsp cream of tartar as a stabilizer. the cream of tartar will allow the sauce to hold for hours in a warmer.
HOPE YOU'RE NOT CURSING ON THIS VIDEO.
"I'm going to keep eating, but you can prob. stop filiming me eating." funny
Someone's been watch Jacques Pepin
I would like to toast her muffin!
What are you making there.....ohh sad
I get the vibe the rest of the test kitchen don't really like her. The way she yelled at Brad, the way Brad said no to tasting her food and then Carla walking off barely saying anything other than nodding and a little"mhmm". it was quite awkward to watch Carlas reaction to the food
Aren’t you suppose to beat the eggs over a “Bain Marie” to kill the stuff in the eggs?
Pro tip:  Sous vide your eggs.  You're welcome.
Didn’t Molly crack 6 eggs in the beginning of the video? and she ends up with 10 eggs.
Your cooking channel rocks! Love the cast of characters.
Hi, geniuine question here. How are the yolks cooked in the bernaise if we're not using a double boiler? or that doesn't matter?
The eggs are not fresh
why does molly always whine about other people
Her: You don’t have to make it in the traditional way.  Gordon Ramsay: YES YOU DO ITS Better!
Molly is super addicted to Salt.
"He's from Louisiana".  That's no excuse!  :-)
Yeah the vortex didn't work for me either. Gently place the egg down, push the whites into each, then leave it alone.
Go Molly 👍😋
Molly ❤️🔥😍😍😍😍
Dis my salt lady❤
Everybody talks about how hard this dish is, but it's actually a joke.  You end up dirtying a lot of dishes and using a lot of eggs though.
Molly lowkey @ Carla and her vortex method is a mood
I'm going to re-heat all 12 eggs, oops I made only 6 :P
Do you know what they call Canadien Bacon in Canada?  Bacon.
She reminds me of Dakota Johnson
Those are not poached eggs, they are supose to look like an actual egg, you shouldn't see the egg yolk
I think I’m in love with Molly and it’s not just because she could feed my belly!!!
I think I found my future
Yoooo. What the salt and pepper at?
God DAMN Molly is just too cute - and very informative  :D
Molly is the kind of wife every man, rich or poor, dream to have. The GOAT, the definition, the ultimate bae
On egg poaching:  Carla: *No need to add vinegar.. definitely vortex*  Molly: *Stop being aggressive to your eggs with the vortex method*   Me: 😐🤯😫
as an Englishman it's so weird to hear muffins described as "English muffins" :D
If she were a little less silly this video would be better.
Too much lemon flavor for me.
Totally lol @ Brad
i thought this said molly makes eggs benedict for a coward and tbh that made me feel like i could follow the instructions so i clicked
Thank you Molly! I just made this for my mom for Mother's Day and she LOVED it <3
Brad suddenly wanted to do a Southwest Airlines commercial "Want to get away"
Raw hollandaise sauce over cooked eggs
My God. I can now make hollandaise
Hands down, molly is my favorite!!
Once again, a shot of Andy's butt is in the video. ...
smells like salmonella
Molly is becoming my favourite
i didn’t know we can blenddddd ooh thanks!!! 👩🏻‍🍳
The eggs multiplied...
This is an impressive preparation. I've always had so much trouble scaling this dish. Even for two people this feels like 5 times harder than making it for one in my experience
Brad's cut off. Sorry, Brad. ;)
This was the most helpful video I can actually implement. I love making eggs Benedict for my friends. But I hate that once I've completely one, it gets cold waiting for the other and so on and so forth. Hahah
Everyone on this Chanel is so funny and down to earth and they are so thorough when explaining the cooking process which I love.
Her husband is one lucky dude
Where is her apron from?
Nice. But one correction: eggs benedict is NOT made with bacon.
Eh, not sure if this is my favorite BA employee to see
That’s what she said !! Toast your muffins ahaha
Don't be mad at Mr. Wourder
Molly is such a breath of fresh air. Sucks that she's prolly a Lib. This is the the type of woman I need minus the Lib.
Wow, this looks so good !! I recently made my version of Eggs Benedict with Turkey Bacon, feel free to check it out and would love to know what you guys think, thanks.
Made the sauce today and it turned out AMAZING!!
That Hollandaise looked like mayonaise☹️
The poaching strategy is interesting.   We make about 3 dozen eggs Benedict for an annual get together and it is always 'slowed down' by the poaching. They sure did look perfect!
damn you must be annoying to work with lol
Hair net?
0:37 5:22 👍
How long will last freshness after putting the cooked egg into ice water?
Great
every time she sez "Who's got time for that?" I do a shot...
My mom makes the best blender hollandaise with a lemony profile. So yummy!
I no way is this eggs benedict , btw the egg look horrible but I guess it for a crowd so who cares about presentation
"It's now getting T H I C C"
I'm sure the recipe is great, but I can't stand listening to Millennial speak.  Not every sentence ends in a question mark, people!
She only liked it cuz she’s hungover lol kidding
Why would you eat raw hollandaise?
The things I would eat off of Molly.
5:20 when Brad Leone is asked if you would like to try the eggs Benny his answer is "not really".  Why the animosity? is he jealous of Molly.  maybe it's because she told him to pipe down while they were recording her and he didn't like being left out of her video. Again, all signs point to jealousy.
Beautiful recipe! Thanks!
Love the simple method of making hollandaise sauce.  Last time I tried to make it was using a Julia Child recipe and that was murderously complicated.
Brad said, "F that, I'm loud, no Benny for me, Lady..."
Will the ice bath make the yolks hard?
Awwww Brad's being a little baby 😪😪😪😪😪
Followed your recipie & tips this morning and it turned out amazing!! ... such a good tip to warm the blender! Thanks!
I love this girl but she salts my heart to death
Thanks for this. Big help.
my favorite actor benedict hollandaise
She's so sassy in this video. XD
hellooooo Molly 😍
Can I keep the Hollandaise in the fridge or freezer to use for later? How long can I store it in the fridge?
Nice job by Molly, but the shot of Carla shoving half an english muffin and egg in her mouth at 5:35 is the perfect finisher.
I want to marry her.
Hearth attack on a plate.....        I love it
When making a hollandise sauce how much do you put butter on?
DAMN THATS ALOT OF BUTTER
Neat
Yeah sure, she does a great job and all that but I've got a better version -  Instead of English muffin use plain white bread Instead of poached egg use a scrambled egg Instead of hollandaise use a combination of Miracle Whip/Mustard.  It sorta looks like hollandaise Instead of Canadian bacon use equal parts fried Spam/bologna - this will really get your guests talking.   Serve these up and pay close attention to who likes them.  See, those people who like them qualify for free birth control forever and ever.....
Loud as brad fermenting all loud
0:35 5:20 He (Brat) is so jealous of her, he can't hide is animosity  The video is excellent and I'm going to do it, thank you.
The hollandaise sauce doesnt have to be in a particular temperature so the eggs ro be safe for eating???
molly is so pretty, your eyes are telling me everthing ,i could cook tonight!
My name is molly!
I wanna strip moly’s clothes off
She is the beautiest
4:14 what are thooooose
eggs benedict is literally the easiest food to make! i suggest throwing some fresh dill in there, yum!!
She has her own style. Nice.
I do not like Molly
Andy's a distraction
Molly is amazing.
Damn she is pretty those eyes lol
I wish I liked eggs.
Carla comin through with the hangover lookin flawless
How BA killed Sunday brunch.
Thank you for showing that poaching eggs can be easy. I will forever question instructional videos telling viewers to swirl the water.
I heard people put vinegar in the simmering water. Why?
Yeah, Brad. Pipe down, you inconsiderate lout!
Made this today and didn't get murdered by my family! 🔪🙅🏼‍♂️ You are my inspiration Molly
Claire: *shoves half an eggs Benedict in mouth*
Not verry good recipe.... dont try
Molly is so sweet and cute 😍
Holyy all this time i thought it was holiday sauce. Not after I saw that HOLLANDAISE
Its says the video was posted *January 23rd 2018* SHE'S A TIME TRAVELER 🙀
Don't tell to be quit, invite that sexy man over!!! Just saying!!!! Brad I 😍
Too buttery
I loveeee this channel
I'd have cooked the ham in a pan or something. Crisp it up, and get it a little brown or something. Just plain ham like that seems rather anticlimactic.
OMG, BLESS U! 😀
Vocal fry...why oh why? Australian question intonation too! Good grief.
I learned so much about eggs benedict from this video, i will be able to feed my dad for one million years. He will become as large as the sun and my duty will become that of Altas when dinnertime comes. You have destined my fate to be this, I hope you're happy.
Blender hollandaise? I'll be damned, eggs benedict are now within my grasp. I'm gonna try with prosciutto!
This is great!
No yelling at Brad, he's God's gift to humanity.
This is NOT a Molly recipe! Everything part of the dish wasn't aggressively salted lol
Eggs Benedict for Benedict Cumberatch 👌
Two easy ways to clarify butter:  1)  melt the butter and refrigerate for an hour, then scrape the solidified fats off the top;  2)  strain melted butter through a coffee filter which is formed into a cone into a coffee cup. The butter drains into the cup, and the solids are filtered out.
Just wanna say this method of poaching eggs is super easy and also worked really well for me! Thanks Molly!
Is there no vinegar in the water?
Why does molly hate brad lmao
I love how half the comments here hate brad/love molly, and vice versa. I mean, it did seem rude not to taste her eggs benedict, but then again there is a nice way to tell someone to quiet down, and being passive aggressive isn’t it.
molly =cum
Simple! I love this series. Go Molly!
I wonder, can I use burger?
Not enough allicin for Brad.
Am I the only one who hates runny egg yolks?
I will butter Ur muffin Well , I will go first - then Chet from “ Weird Science “ will go second -  after he’s done bring Catatonic in a closet ...
I love Molly
Love that she stood up to Brad
no vortex? this lady is a pretty liar
Subtle shade thrown at Tasty’s Vortex method
5:00 - "Be generous [with the hollandaise], it's kind of what we're here for."  The moment Molly won me over!
It’s so hilarious to me that Molly uses so many abbreviations in her speech but instead of just saying “jeez Louise” she pulls out a “jeez Louisiana.”
I wish she gave a shoutout to Heston Blumenthal and Kenji Lopez-Alt for these technique! Borderline plagiarism lol
WE NEED MORE MOLLY
Her vibe always feels like she’s forced to do the video
Molly is one sexy salty nun
finggies AND bennie? i'm sold
How much is two sticks of butter ?
Geez Louisiana is the cutest thing I've ever heard. Molly is everyone's dream BAE
Omlet is just boneless eggs Benedict
Biggest mistake at restaurants besides a non runny yolk, is a sauce without enough lemon.
Lol Brad
What’s up with Molly and uncooked eggs but at the same time I live
damn she cute
Were those muffins sliced with a fork?
Im in love
Why do they all talk like that?
excellent hollandaise idea - can't wait to try
Annoying.
This chick is the girl you take to meet ya mama and mawmaw...
Molly is bae
A to aggressive way to cook an egg? Snowflake, stand-up....
This doesn't look like something Gordon Ramsey would approve of
"We're filming." "So?" "PIPE DOWN!" "Oh, ok"
Thumbs up... the sauce out of the blender... great!
Poor Molly, I don't think she's very liked in the test kitchen.  Brad saying "Not really" was kinda rude to do to her while on camera.  I'm sure they have a friction relationship.  But I don't think Andy cares much for her either.
id eat her poo but the vortex method is vital for a perfectly shaped poached egg, you can see how some egg yolks are off center, disaster!
Like Molly personality she's a cutie and her dishes are so easy to follow 👍😊
Lol, How time has I heard "Brad's so loud!" in these videos... the sexy manbeast he is!
Molly's a hottie
Drammmaaaaaa
Okay... beautiful chef, excellent recipe.... but the audio doesn’t sync up with the video :/
OOoohhh......Caaaaaaarrrlaaa! Food war. She just did the vortex....Oh.. Oh yeah...It's ON! Hey, Vin! Get the popcorn! Who's better than me, eh, Vinnie?
My God she’s beautiful. Also I’m making this. Not gonna lie, the double boiler kept me from attempting this fella. Blender makes me happy.
I love Molly’s videos!
The goddamned uptalk....
I know Brad, Molly is super nice and I watch all her videos, but she ain't no Claire. :(...... Lol
1000
Yeah, I am number 1,000!  I have watched three Molly videos, I am now motivated to go out and buy your magazine in the store and maybe subscribe.  You are so good on video clear voice straight to the point techniques, some commentators noted the wedding ring, that's very cool to wear that during your videos, I'm going to try to watch every bon appetit video on YouTube.  I think you for bringing a little joy into my life.
I use bacon on my eggs benedict. Because there just isn't enough fat on them with butter basted english muffins and butter sauce.
brilliant!
Yami Brilliant Lol
Wow! She's good
Is Molly the only one in the kitchen with the balls to call out Brad?
Carla’s my favorite lol
Do these awesome peeps work at this place full time? Or are they chefs in other kitchens? Or maybe they are my accountants....
Lol no vortex?! Molly putting Carla on blast! 😆
I love you more than this comment can describe
Shorty said jeez Louisiana issa wife y'all
I want her to narrate my life!
I don't even like eggs I'm just watching this for Molly
Great recipe, great video, and she's really cool!
replace the ham with salmon 1000x better!
Idk what wrong with me but every time I see Carla I get annoyed. She’s like that girl in high school who bullied everyone because she thought she was better than them but really no one even cared she was bullying them because no one liked her.
The inflection on the end of her sentences is pretty unbearable.
You are awesome!  You made it so simple. Thank you!!!!
Yeah! Pipe down Brad!!
shes so cute
Thanks Brad
"We're  just gonna slaughter these guys" <3 Yeah, hollandaise is such a cholesterol and fat bomb! Eggs benedict are a super bomb. But they are delicious. Definitely not something for everyday's breakfast though.
What's with gourmet chefs and runny yolks, jesus.
Thanks, Molly, for the great quote:  "Be Generous, It's Kinda What We're Here For"!    5:03/5:47
Molly is funny and cute but can’t figure out whether she can cook or not!
I wanna cry I wanna eat this so bad
I love the look of the Eggs Benedict you cooked and have to try making some myself at home.
I clicked cause of Molly
I love watching Molly's videos she's such a nice and relaxing presence. I think the right word would be lovely.
Watching Molly cooking makes me feel warm on the inside.
Whoa, hearing Vinny telling Brad to be quiet was like seeing the Honeymooners.  Now I know it's "Bam, zoom, straight to the Moon" with Vinny. We're here to support you Brad.   We're also here to support you Vinny, we've seen how Claire treats you.
Nice trick with the egg in the strainer.
Mollys cute, hi from UK
How much of this hair gets in the food? Shouldnt she be wearing a chefs hat if she works in a kitchen?
Anyone else think it was really hot the way she cracked those eggs?
I'm just here to stare into Molly's deep blue eyes while I breathe heavily...
I followed this today and my eggs benie was sooo good like 😍😍👌👌👌
I wanna work there! You get to eat delicious food every single day 😂😜
lol there was no merit to her not wanting to use the vortex other than impatience and her personal opinion... So take that with a grain of sand. Her entire way of cooking and preparing eggs benedict just screams lazy cook!
Can you guys PLUULEASE stop making Hollandaise with lemon juice. That is not Hollandaise. Hollandaise is made with vinegar reduced with shallots, tarragon and peppercorns (bayleaf if you like), and then strained.
I like how confident she was in the video. Poaching eggs is little intimidating, and she made 6....dumped them in a large pot of water just like that. Brava, Molly!  Thanks for the tips.
Teach me Molly...
Nah Canadian bacon is the way
I was the 666,000th view. Should I be scared?
I would love for Molly to crack my eggs 🥚
well thats fine.. sometimes brad do that also lol 😂😂😂
shes hot af
I have a feeling her and Brad don't like each other much.
ehhhh prolly more mayonnaise than hollandais
My boyfriend made eggs Benedict following this recepie and OMFG...I could have that for breakfast every single day of my life.
Wait did I miss something? Was the sauce made with raw eggs yolks and then just blended with other stuff and just served that way? Raw? But still great video I’m just stupid and probably missed something 😂😂❤️
Step 1: Watch J. Kenji López-Alt Videos. Step 2: Create Eggs Benedict video as your own. Step 3: Profit
oof was that a call out of carla's poaching method or xD
I know How to do Eggs Benedict but the instructor is So watchable!  Sweet demeanor
I need a hot cook in my kitchen too! Haha Seriously Molly, you rock!
She casually drops the eggs in water. When I do that they don't end up perfect and poached.
I got sick by Molly’s egg:)😭😭😭
I will fight any one of you to the death for Molly. She is amazing. "Jeez Louisiana" cmon.. so cute. I always say "Jeezus Louisuz"
What's up with not trying the Bennies Brad?
Brad only likes the pastry chefs with the gray streak of hair.
Woah, I thought hollandaise sauce was like mayo and mustard? We use that with our eggs and call it hollandaise sauce lol. I can’t imagine what melted butter and some egg yolks with lemon juice blended would taste like. Hmm... interesting.
Really seems like she doesn't wanna do this lol
I want Brad tho
salavating:'(
Over cooked eggs
Carla really just said she had one glass of wine, gurl
Cara Delevigne please
Molly is too beautiful.
Of course somebody put a ring on Molly’s finger.
Poor brad😂 I freaking love him sm
Met Nederlandse mayo is alles goed :P  maar dan wel de echte mayo he!
Awww Molly 🤩
I don't get it...why not prep and toast the English muffins first (6 mins), then make the hollandaise ("30 seconds") and poach the eggs last (2-3 mins) so they don't have to be reheated?
This is a two man job if you want to serve the eggs hot
Who's your favourite BA host? Claire! No wait Molly! No I mean Brad! No wait I mean Carla. Damn it.  This is harder than choosing a favourite movie.
DON'T SCOLD BRAD HE'S PERFECT
I can't eat raw eggs
hey eggs benedict cucumber is my favorite actor
I don't trust real hollandaise, the raw eggs freak me out.
Hi Molly, nice on the eggs benny. I use smoked ham instead of Canadian bacon - nice change.
Why the hell does she have such a cute personality
Carla cameo makes my day. Thanks for this Molly. I have such a hard time poaching eggs
Carla cameo makes my day. Thanks for this Molly. I have such a hard time poaching eggs
Carla cameo makes my day. Thanks for this Molly. I have such a hard time poaching eggs
Molly is my new hero. Blender Hollandaise? Where has this been all my life?
I feel like these would be stone cold before you get them to the table. I always cook them to order when I have guests over.
she’s so prettyyy
WA NLNG UNTA KA GAHIMONG EGGS BENEDICT KUNG DILI PAREHA TANAN IMO GIHIMO ATAY MAN DIAY KA DIAY BULOI, SGE PAJUG INGUN NGA "DI KO GANAHAN MANGGD TSS DI NECESARY" YAWA HIKOG OY
She made a whole batch like a boss.. I can't even poach one egg!
I love Molly! She’s so sweet!
Beef between Molly and Brad?
Refusing eggs benedict should be a crime, Brad.
Solid gold.  Love the prepping eggs tips (strainer, gentle boil, ice bath) and no messing about sauce method.  My favourite brekky just got better.  Cheers!
where do you get your aprons?? They are so cute
I love all of their contradicting poaching methods and the subtle egg related roasting
I would love to hang out in the BA test kitchen!!! Never thought of this as an option for crowd sized Eggs Benedict, smart and easy. good job!
Brad : “so?” I DIED AHAHAGA
no personality
Leave poor brad alone. He didn’t mean to.
Keep your day job
why is there this weird debate of who was rude to who between Brad and Molly, the start was a typical interaction in the BA kitchen you see all the time in the videos when they chat. as for when Brad didn't want an egg, did it really seem malicious? the way he said it and acted looked to me like he was either really not hungry at the time or busy with what he was doing at the pc and didn't want to leave it to taste the dish.
Where do you keep the eggs if you're cooking them the night before?
MORE MOLLY
The BA kitchen looks like a really cool place to work
Its rare that we get to see her smile, she's gorgeous
Brad, the jerk of the crew......every job has one.
Brad is butt hurt! Lol 😝 hey brad want a eggs  Benny ?! No 😒😕not really lol ! Molly more for you and me ! Love you to brad ! Don't want you to get butt hurt again 😂
Molly and Carla you two are absolute bosses.
Bon Appetit is really into the binary gender work romance roles in this video series.
Insta-like for a benedict build.
brad is slowly making me more mad with every video that he makes an appearance in...
MY FAVORITE
Molly is officially my favourite, brad is overrated!
Isn't she technically making a mayonnaise there, not a Hollandaise?
But Carla said we should vortex =(
Who’s gonna make this?
Gordon Ramsey would tear u apart
Molly doesn't seem to have the joy of cooking. She cooks as if she were paid to, this video is lifeless and lacks enthusiasm. Brad may be loud but he joy for food is undeniable.
She s fun.Who's she?
Tried this recipe and came out great!! Always wanted to make eggs benedict but always seemed so complicated
The hangover lady devoured the whole thing
Canadian bacon is ham isn't it?
I only came for Brad
Brad is jealous 😹🤣
I love Molly
I love that you captured that bit of sass at the end, hahaha. Great chef and great straightforward no-frills presentation of the recipe.
LOVE YOU MOLLY...    FROM INDONESIA
She could be dakota johnsons sister
In the restaurant that hollandaise is a b%tch to keep warm without splitting. I always do double boiler with lemon juice and white wine, then emulsifying it with butter. Trouble free hollandaise.
girl have my baby, or the other way around, why not both, lets both overpopulate the planet
you asked a question about why i don't call myself even thou my paper work says " Chef" which was removed and used world Class cook.  Cause Chef in dictionary means two things to cut one's self, or it also means in European country fluff flour. mainly here it's used as  "chef" means to cut one's self could be why there accidents in Restaurants."
that actually served with jelly but interesting enough that looks good. People often make up there own way to make egg benedict, so that this different but still is egg benedict, which is interesting, as Egg's benedict in European Country is interesting bread round no white of egg and just yellow part of egg, with a quick pinch of salt on egg not ham, and often served with jam or jelly.  it's hard to mess it up some serve with bacon thin sliced which is good. Far as the one thing girl told asked you to ask me how i get Jelly inside english muffin can't tell you even she knows.  Ya i almost forgot it was canadian ham Vapor cooked in streamer, and then broiled a little and then served on muffin garlic butter in pan not on toast, "pan fried"  with mozerilla, and lightly cook tomatoe no seeds under cheese but cooked lightly in broiler make sure only cooking with door closed for about 10 seconds just to "reference of words sweat meet and not so much tomatoe as then put together after toast enlgish muffin in toaster for "2" setting  as when put together it was broiled for 20 seconds or less. as english muffin was half cooked to finish in broiler. if you add egg get cookie cutter round that has height and then weight its so doesn't get all over place under cookie cutter,   Noted seeds removed from tomatoe lightly salt idoized salt one sized Was what i had other person make for you.  World class cook. "Twes"
The poaching water needed some white vinegar to keep the eggs intact better.  Trust me I’m an eggspert
I feel like.. I reeeally want to work in a place like this
Brad said not really hahaha that’s what she gets for being rude to him when she told him to pipe down he’s such a smart nice guy
molly = best girl
You flipped my heart
“How to make eggs Benedict the millennial way”
I want to eat eggs off of Molly’s snatch
They're good bennies Bront.
Hi is she single thanks
Did I miss something or are the yolks in the sauce supposed to be in cooked
Hi Bon Appétit - what happens to the food thats made that staff doesn’t want to eat? Curious how you avoid food waste.
I would eat anything that molly  cooks
Does anyone there even like Fred?
I would much rather have that platter of eggs Benedict than a birthday cake.
Molly😍
molly is cute
I need a Molly in my life.
I love this girl
This is the most attractive woman to ever exist.
she's so delightfully lovely :)
do people honestly like runny eggs?? it's really gross to me, i feel like it's still raw, and not used to that texture. can i leave my eggs for longer, at least for a more creamy yolk??
effect needle divide progress corridor diagnose adjustment drive material off exception increasing fat now
She’s so cute!
It's official, I'm in love!
"... [I]t's now getting thick."  Right you are.
"Typically the recipe uses Canadian bacon, but i prefer sliced ham." psh, you can't fool me, i've seen iCarly, Spencer said its the same thing.
What in the hell do you people think bacon is up here, bacon is bacon.
*cough  Peameal bacon
i can totally see brad making similar videos with his own twist to them and make it look like a battle of chefs. welcome to office drama btw.
hollandaise probably contains salmonella, raw egg yolk...
It’s so nice to not have to do the vortex method lol this video was great
Louise from Bob's Burgers all grown up?
NO ONE PUTS BRAD {baby] IN THE CORNER!!
I'll take 10
The sauce is getting T H I C C
I tried to make her hollandaise sauce and it tasted horrible
For me, benny has been what I have wanted to make for SO LONG. It has always scared me because the sauce is tricky.  I hear people talking about it breaking and such, but this looks WAY easier! I will have to give it a shot one day.
You hurt Brad so badly he didn't even want eggs bennadict
Can't blame Brad for not being interested in eating those eggs, or being on her segment. Please, just focus on your actually talented personalities, like Claire, Carla and Brad? Between Molly's vocal foxing and Paris-Hilton tone, and Andy's hyper aggressive doucheiness, I'm just about done with BA's subscription.
Can we get Molly to do more videos
Brad's boisterous voice is a gift!!!
It's funny in Canada we don't call it Canadian bacon, it's called 'back bacon' as it comes from the loin.  It can also be called pea meal bacon if it rolled in cornmeal that was once ground yellow peas as a preservative.  It is cured not smoked so it's more ham like and nearly trimmed of most fat.
omg she's a young carla. Literally sounds just like her, too!
Step aside, Brad. Molly's my new favourite. I feel like I'm in the kitchen with my cool sister where she's teaching me to make breakfast for the family on the first day of summer vacation.
This woman knows how to handle her eggs like a Benedict.
G E N T L Y
Brad, thats rude dude
Who refuses a bite of Eggs Benedict?!? =)
"Jeez Louisiana"  ded
So?
Those look delicious! And Molly is so pretty!
T H I C C
Does Brad not like Molly? Or is he just a little upset because of the way she informed him that he was being too loud at that moment?
Annoying city white girl voice...check..."likeeee ooohg my gawwddd"
Anyone knows her Instagram?
Vortex egg lady was probably giving her some wicked side eye.
She doesn't like brad....
"Don't believe in a vortex" omg is Molly shading Carla
she looks like the sister from the guy from buzzfed if he has a sister
Great job, Molly!  Eggs Benedict is one of my favorite breakfasts.  Great Hollandaise lesson.  It really bothered me that Brad couldn't be bothered to even taste it.  He now falls into my "a**hole" category and will always get a thumbs down from me.  He was probably pissed because he was asked to "keep it down" while you were filming.  Thanks for your great tips!
Carla is quaking
*Carla drops an "Eggs 4 Ways" video* *Calls for the vortex method* But...but...but...
*visits Bon Appetit*  "I'm trying to find molly"
so hollandaise has raw egg yolks in it? doesn't seem safe to eat
Brad was probably mad she yelled at him. Poor Molly had to eat all those eggs by herself :(
Id sauce her eggs
what suck about this dish is washing all those bowls after
Yeah we want her more, maybe with a slightly more erotic top.
why is she so sad?
Ends most of her sentences in a question mark...sounds like a conceited know it all witch than a presenter who enjoys what shes doing. Has lots to brush up. Till then im skippin her clips.
WHAT IS THIS ADORABLE CREATURE AND WHERE DO I GET ONE
Wtf I freak out over making 2 eggs Benedicts and shes making a whole party platter. I'm impressed
i've watched BRAD and CLAIRE and CARLA for a long time now. MOLLY got me to sub! +1   p/s I LOVE YOU CLAIRE. THE MOST.
Molly is hair goals and eggs Bennie goals!
This was so relaxing
TV Magic! Make 12 eggs out of 6!
Geez Louisiana
Stfu, Brad....
Cant stand her
Those aprons look like maternity clothes.
She's really great at this, hope she makes more videos
im definitely trying this at my next family reunion
"Not really"? Are you kidding me Brad? I would eat eggs Benny at the drop of a hat.
I just had a adorable overdose...
There's something suspicious about the poaching when you never get to focus on the eggs til they are being plated
Nope, not liking her. I bet Brad doesn't like her either
Molly is the hottest pepper in the BA kitchen (Sorry Brad)
Hipster central. 😆Nice, easy, anyone can-do tips. Right on!
Molly seems like a great addition to the BA kitchen, love her! :)
I love women who are cute and can cook 😍
👍👍👍👍
Hollandaise in a blender, never would have thought about it but sounds sooooo much easier.
All this talk about brad and molly...just give em some time .she is new to the food scene and needs to adjust is all.
Is she from the valley?
does eggs benedict traditionally get seasoned with salt?
Carla and Brad are my favorite but this was really cool and informative and to the point. But in a nice way inviting way lol
I really liked having her, her “but this is how I do it” way of cooking is just fantastic! More pleath
Must fine more of her
why not just poach the eggs once the guests arrive? It's only 3 minutes.
You leave Brad alone!
Great video - Thanks Molly.
we need Molly and Brad cooking together :D
i'm not sure eggs are supposed to bounce
Leave Brad the hell alone.
why is this so easy wtf
Leave brad alone
I want to marry her and listen to her talking about eggs benedict and hollandaise sauce every night for the rest of my life
Bacon. Always. Bacon.
Greatest breakfast vid on youtube?
That ring's makin' me sad.
Alright, Molly <3
Brad is such a brad.
More videos with Molly! She is awesome!
She's cute and a great chef!
Add in a touch of white vinegar
Molly, I'm old school on hollandaise which cooks the yolks, your's is really considered a mayo. Nice shortcut though. If u cook yolks using Dbl boiler method & incorporate ur method, perfect hollandaise!
I ship brad and Molly
where;'s claire at
i want to know what Brad is doing
hate benedict but click for the girl
Who else thought she was making Eggs Benedict with a crowd watching?
Is it safe to have raw egg in the hollandaise sauce?
Need more of these cooking for crowd theme videos...
More people ate half-sour’s gourmet gushers than these eggs bennys. and I think that that is a crime. Eff you brad!!! Why has it come to this!!!
Move over Brad, there's a new Brad in town
Ya got me girl, my husband and I love eggs Benedict and you made it look nice and easy!
OMG WHERES BRAD?!?! jk she seems really cool
Pure quality
That looks egg-celent! :3
Geez Louisinana! I'm officially a Molly fan.
Her voice and the way she talks totally reminds me of Kristen Schaal. "Geeze Louisiana."    I dig it.
Holy beautifulness
She cant talk to brad that way
Wow she is so lovely
i see a rivalry brewing, let the games begin!
she was in the Kids eat stuff vid?
make texture with texture slices, texture sauce within texture time. luv you molly
in love with Molly <3 More Molly <3 More Brad  More Bon Appetit !MORE!
Hangover from one glass of wine? Yee gads. Love her though :D
Sorry if I missed it, but is vinegar necessary for when you poach the eggs? I've had such mixed results and, yeah, the vinegar helps the eggs setup better but I have to be so careful to keep from adding too much vinegar (which ruins the taste of the eggs).
1 of the big t.v cooks say's to add some vinger to the boiling water  so it make it  hold better
She is gorgeous.
I love Molly and everyone I've seen on here. I think it was just a misunderstanding bc Brad was like "?. Oh!"  And they're both professionals so, I bet they're fine. And damn I love all the food and how everyone's so creative with what they cook! ♡
All right, Chef John from Food Wishes
T H I C C sauce.
Vocal fry...grrr
More Molly
Dammit Brad, don't be rude!
Is it some kind of requirement for everyone who works at Bon Appetit to be so beautiful and kind? I'm in love with her
Dang, that's a lot of butter.
Carla at the end :) :)
Please get her a dialogue coach.
I'll eat what ever she cooks
Isn't simmering water just below simmering called poaching water?  Shouldn't you want to poach anything in poaching water?
GOD DAMN BRAD
thumbs down just because she's mean to Brad
I really dislike her tone
I cant be the only one wishing for a tension filled battle series in which both Brad and Molly try to outdo eachother by cooking "gently" or fermenting everything. In the epic season they finally profess their love for eachother and they live happily ever after!
what or why is there so much tension between her and Brad hmmmmm.....?
tried out this recipe for a party and it was a hit! thanks so much c:
why does she talks like this? you know where everything has a question mark at the end of it? with an upward inflection? at the end of every sentence?
Is Brad contractually obligated to cameo in every BA video? (not that I'm complaining)
she's a gentle soul
I had a corned beef hash egg benedict from an Irish themed place in Cape Cod.  It was amazing
Easily one of the best channels I'm subscribed to. Quality content.
Awesome channel! Subbed!!!
Bae
This changes things. Thanks! What? Not a peep from Vinnie?
Brad and Molly sitten in a tree. K. I. S. S. I. N. G. First comes love. Then comes marriage. Then comes baby* in the baby carriage, Sucking his thumb, Wetting his pants, Doing the hula ...
That is more like buttered mayonnaise
Hey BA, any chance you could consider your international audience in your measurements for recipes? We don't use US cups or have sticks of butter the same size, weights would be handy and easier to convert!
MOLLY IS RAD, CAN WE PLEASE HAVE MORE VIDEOS FROM HER
Marry me?
What's water? She must mean wourder.
If you really have to crank 'em out, I get really good results poaching my eggs in the oven using a muffin tin.
Yo, that pinch of cayenne tho? My girl Molly went to the Chef John school for cooking! But seriously, I’m jealous of her egg dropping technique there; that was super scary/impressive.
Brad ain't about dat life
Thanks for all the tips :) !
What's with this dassy lost brad?
Does bae have any other videos? Does bae have her own show yet?
Will you marry me?
MOLLY I CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE THIS FOR MOTHER'S DAY! my mom is a huge eggs benedict fan and I bet she'd love an eggs benedict party. also, ignore the sexist jerks in the comments!
Molly is a really gentle host, which is a nice balance from the all over the place Brad. Lol
use a croissant instead of an English muffin... youre welcome
You should remake this video. Without Brad or any allusions to him. He is so disrespectful, she is filming calls him out, and he responds like a jerk. I expect more from Bon Appetite.
I came for the Eggs Benedict and now I'm in love with Molly. Dang!
geez louisiana
Im not sure what I like more Molly or the recipe
LOL how does brad end up making a feature in every video
Molly is gorgeous
"We've come this far with the butter sauce, why hold back now"... I love it, also my favourite breakfast.
I like my poached eggs like a nice round ball shape.
Can you please show more videos that involve this much butter. Thank you.
Is it just me or was that a reallllly awkward ending?
Aww, look at Molly’s face when Brad says he doesn’t want to try one. A brief wince of pain. Quit being a jerk, Brad.
I like molly, but i already subscribed a long time ago. Another sub if there's one.
Really? Ceramic plates?? But there's no plates like foam for the Hollandaise!
Ah nostalgia. Those heady college days. 20 years ago. Goddammit, now I feel old.
pinch of cayenne?? that's Chef John's move!! shout out foodwishes lol
I am so relieved I dont have to whisk the hollandaise anymore this is so much easier and also makes making the sauce and eggs benny at home a lot more accessible imo . sometimes bon appetite does a great job demystifying some dishes n provding alternate n more accessible techniques n i am SO HERE FOR IT !!!!
I'm sure there are some proper french chefs that might take issue with this method.
My audio was super slowed but the video was normal, super weird haha
A stick blender is better for smaller amounts of hollandaise.
woder and louisiana sounds like a good match..
i hope brad is her husband
her voice is fine??? it sounds normal i'm not sure why yall are saying her voice is bad
genius!!!
Takes 1 glass of wine, the day after, I've got a hangover so that makes it ok to stuff my face with eggs Benedict
Seems like a fun place to work haha
did home girl just claim that SHE believes it is best to poach just under a simmer???  Not like that has been classic french technique since before escoffier *eyeroll*.  THAT BEING SAID still a good video for people that dont know whats up haha
I apologize I came for the eye candy, the food is nice too..
wayy too much work for this fancy shmancy stuff
The idea of this video (a way to make most things in advance) is really clever and something that I've been wanting to learn for some time. The recipe seems good, the instructions clear and the presenter very likable. But I must say, that uptalk was HARD. All in all, great video.
I like her appoach to eggs benedict
Need more Molly in my life.
thanks mollyyyyyyyy
where is molly's apron from? dying to know!!!
How dare you yell at Brad... Lol
How does BA feel about sous vide eggs vs poaching a batch?
damn it Brad lol. Get you some benedick
Everytime she says "yield" take a shot.
If Gordon Ramsey says do the vortex method you do the vortex method
why is everything she say a question
Reheat the eggs for a total cook time of 3-4 min. Or wait and do the eggs when the ham is cooking and no need to reheat...
She learnt the technique from Woodhouse!!
Mmmmm looks really good, my mouth is watering. I have to make this!  and shut up Brad! 😁
More brad and vinny instead please :D
Say yield again.  I dare you
This and munchies are the best YouTube channels period
Cool vid idea, how to make stuff in big serving batches
I thought she did really well. A realistic recipe, thanks.
She kinda has the cuteness of the girl that plays supergirl.
ok...wait... never... ever.... tell brad to keep it down! if anything invite him over! brad is bae!
No broccoli?
Who the fuck uses Canadian bacon?
wahh, that hollandaise sauce looks so easy
At least she’s not Andy
IM ON THAT MOLLY
This looks to be a great method - defo worth a try! Thanks Molly!!!
Yawn. There are a thousand million videos on how to make eggs benedict.
*sigh* ...Brad? - eat the fuckin eggs. <3
lol Brad !
tfw u watch too much food wishes and cayenne everything
Since when was one person a crowd? 🤷‍♀️
Braaaaaaaaaad
Love this girl
I used a nice thick slice of sourdough bread
Something about her is way too much attractive
pinch of cayenne. chef john was here!
I see lot of Chef Johns inspiration in this recipe :D
Why does she speak and act like a twelve year old child?  Every other word ends with a lilt, like she's asking a question?
i love how she says "thick"
Love this!!! And i love this girl, she has a lot of really cool tips and hacks!!
HI BRAD IN THE BACKGROUND
Very hot, this girl. Recipe is good too
close your eyes and she turns into Dakota Johnson
You could do a video on the Californian Inflection.
I took a cooking class once and this is blasphemy!
molly u cute :3
I do not like here, just incredibly annoying
Bit*ch thats not hollandaise! It is butter mayo. And dont talk whats traditional and whats not if you dont even know.
I've never seen a professional poach without vinegar in the water.  I'm surprised her eggs had such a nice shape.
Carla trying to make peace between Molly and Brad... Cute, but futile.
Very relaxing. Hope I dream of the egg bennies 2nite. XD
A pretty girl who's not afraid to put Brad in his place?  I think I'm in love
I wonder how much they paid Brad to just sit in the background of every wide shot in this video
I wonder what Brad was talking about. And doing on the computer. Brad is the best.
Molly marry me please
Background brad yay
Bring back claire!
*Good lord I'd drag my balls through a mile of broken glass to listen to her fart through a walkie talkie.*
She's rude af, Brad ftw.
The people have spoken: we like Molly.   ~RandMan14, on behalf of the people
My biggest problem with this video is the way Brad is spoken to in the beginning.
WHERE IS FUPA CHEF (Brad)!
I really liked Molly as a host! And who doesn't love eggs benedict??
catering 101
Other than that Amish fucking apron....decent vid that wasn't Brad.
i came for the high quality comments
Really excellent. Keep Molly. The tips were great steps well organized. The only criticism would be sometimes she didn't look at the camera but off into space. Not a really bad thing, just a note.
How do you prevent the batch of eggs just cooking into one giant clump of poached eggs? (Since you said that a vortex wouldn't work when you cook in batches)
CUTEEEE
More Molly videos
I love Brad, but Molly is a great addition to the Test Kitchen how-tos
DUDE LET'S SHOW BRAD FOR MORE VIEWS LMAO
my boy Brad being a jerk!
Brad in the back grou..shhhhhhhhh!!!!!!
👌🏼
Great vid! I hope it wasnt becuse Molly is an absolute 10/10. No.. that wasnt it. Awesome vid! :D
If you  don't have a Vitamix, you make the Hollandaise with an immersion blender too. It's even easier because you can just dump everything in a tall cup and blitz it.
I thought Claire was a natural beauty till Molly came along
How do I work for Bon Appétit?
I was all down until you didn't prefer Canadian Bacon lol jk jk excellent video
*gentle* *gentle* _geeeeeennnnnttlllllleeeee_
There is no way she is single.
Those are some sexy freaking genetics. How much?
‘Yield’ 🤦🏾‍♀️
There is a reason why you make hollandaise sauce to sell. That stuff is bacterial breeding ground, especially held at room temp.
Tell Brad to simmer down! LOL
Brad’s probably telling vinny how much he loves him
Get ur exotic butters
Delicious!!!
Now I hate Brad... SO RUDEEE, Now you are just somebody I used to know
All that work to get tender eggs then you put it in an ice bath which makes them tough
Worst technique I have ever seen.
Straining the eggs just like Heston! Great techinque.
Only Molly I acknowledge is Yeh
Sounds so NERVOUSSS
she seems like the most annoying sassy person to work with
Idk about you guys but I know I'm #TeamGentlePoach
Benedict was a traitor!!!!
Blender hollandaise! I love Molly.
She's so lovely
As someone from the UK, I have only had 'English Muffins' at McDonalds, we really don't eat them. At least not in my area of the South.
Somewhat getting the vibe of rivalry between brad and molly, or i watch too many romcoms, idk man
"Cayenne" _Food wishes??_
Molly is bae. Egg Bae. MORE MOLLY.
Brad is always at the computer  ...BRAD GET BACK TO WORK!
yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup
Oh my god who is this adorable human being?! I wanna see more of this Molly.
put white vinegar in the water to cook poached eggs so the eggs can get nice and round
You all wish you had a Molly
#NotMyMolley #MolleyMoker #ZAGAT
that is not a proper hollandaise....
Brad has turned into such a diva since he’s become popular.  Gosh.  Also, great vid.  I’ve had the eggs benny maybe twice in my life.  That’s how special it is.  I’ve been building up the kajones to make it myself.
What speed should we blend at?
Guy in the background cooking wearing a full suit. Gotta let you know he's in charge.
I hit like every time I see Brad or they mention him. Molly is good too though.
Wow..
Shout out to Vinny
BACKGROUND BRAD
I like her clogs
Lose the vocal fry
i like this girl
BRADDDDDD
Still looking pretty wild in that pot there.
I just came here for Molly.
Great video. Never would have thought Eggs Benny were so easy to make at home. Nor did I expect to develop a crush on Molly. She seems so sweet and has the most adorable voice! More Molly showing us how to cook stuff we wouldn't expect to be able to pull off at home, please!
Naaaah... video would be better with Brad
Who hits "thumbs down" on Eggs Benedict?  <laugh>  WTF people?
Ayy, why you gonna come after brad like that ?
Wow, you can tell that Molly and Brad do not get along. So feisty, both sides.
I like Molly! She just needs to loosen up a bit. She didn't have as much hospitality as the other cooks but that comes with time. I see her personality a bit & I like it!
thats not a sauce hollandaise, its just butter mixed with egg yolks and lemon juice . Its missing  the vinegar reduction.
Top Favorites: Brad & Molly
You just dont tell brad to quiet down or he'll not eat your petty food.
Molly don’t tell Brad to shut up he is our God
Hi Carla!!! Never ever turn down Eggs Benedict.
That took so long to make but very mouth-watering in the end...now I feel so hungry I could probably eat all those in one serving.
I made eggs benedict once, and the hollandaise just tasted of lemon and egg yolk, it was awful
Oh my goodness thank you for the straining tip! Those loose wild whites drive me mad when I poach!
Benedict makes molly and eggs for a croud
So much upspeak
She wants to take a more gentle A-POACH when cooking eggs!
I thought Brad was being sarcastic when he rejected the benny. WHO SAYS NO TO EGGS BENNY?!?!
Molly is the most beautiful woman on Gods decreasingly less green earth
gentle lil orbs
It will be a glorious day when all these hosts don’t need to keep calling out Brad in every video. I understand lots of people like him. He’s cool. But these other hosts are cool too. They just need to leave him out. Or how will they ever be better?
Looked as if Molly and Brad had a thing and it ended badly, her fault, and now Brad is staying CLEAR. I like the trick with getting rid of the extra stringy whites by straining it, but that's not hollandaise.
*still doesnt know if eating raw yolks is dangerous or not*
It's such a shame that Molly came up with a useful recipe and explained it super clearly just to have the comments section overtaken by horny losers.
Brad was kind of a douche in this episode. Brad should take a second to remove his ego from other coworkers videos. Very clever way to make some eggs b.
Nice recipe but this hollandaise look like a buttery mayonaise too me, the real one star with a sabayon...
she’s smart and hot asf lmao
2:18 does she mean wouder?
Credit to Heston Blumenthal for the straining the eggs trick...
Brad ain't been getting any nookie from the wifey lately, don't hold it against him.
When brad speaks, you listen. How dare you interrupt him!!!!
Love her. Love this video. Brad lol.
...When you don't notice the valley accent and realize it's because you have a valley accent and can't tell. 😂😐
shes hot, but claire still #1.
YUM, yes please!  Oh and the eggs benedict looks delicious too! ;-)
Cayenne in hollandaise? What is this, Foodwishes.com?  j/k
When Molly smiles it takes me miles From where I feel unsure When Molly smiles I realise   *She's no ordinary girl* *Mmmmmmmmm* *No ordinary girl* *Oohhhhh*
Molly is sexy asf not gonna lie
She's a cute, I'm shipping her and Brad
Everyone's talking about her accent and here I am, English not being my mother tongue, and I'm already proud that I can tell she's American. I literally can't hear the difference between any English accents.
Molly didn't ferment the eggs which is why Brad wanted no part of that.
Dream woman. holy shit
How dare you interrupt Brad's rehearsal for Its Alive lol
Dang Brad, being a jerk a bit.
You're gonna lose some fans talkin' smack to Brad like that!
woe, who's Brad and who does he think he is? chill down yo
A real women. Noice.
woah shes cute
this is an exact rip of an old chefsteps video
Congrats to Molly for the promotion, hopefully we'll see more of her. A buddy comedy with Brad maybe?
A PINCH OF CAYENNE! Where is the Chef John cameo???!?"?!?!?
Molly: You are super cute!
id marry her just for her eggs
She was so mean to Brad wtf
Where do I find a woman like this? I'd propose on the spot.
Jeez Louisiana
bRAd iN tHe bacKGrouND
Love it! Great presentation and an extremely useful topic. Awesome job, thank you!
Nice Recipe
She bute
I love Carla haha
ya'll rude she just blew my whole world away and made eggs benedict easier than ever WHAT thank you???? im gonna go make some i need to cook these eggs anyway
Anybody else find this video delightful...  Except when she yelled at Brad and then you had murder in your heart?  😂
Everyone's hating on her voice lol. I thought she was sweet and relaxing! Great content! Definitely learned something
this is so extra i love it
is it just me or does she look like dakota johnson
Did Brad like them though?  make more vegan recipes please! Those on your website are delicious!!!
VIDEO NEEDS A YIELD COUNTER
Hollandaise and all the other sauces containing eggs are done over the stove in order to pasteurize the eggs themselves..
Isn't this just a tiny bit a Food Lab rip off?
I would like to toast your muffins if you know what I mean...just kidding im sorry
Brad probably handled tha sass later on in his office
whos the baddie
Molly! at long last
ins't canadian bacon just ham?
Dang her husband is lucky. If she wasn’t married, I would’ve wifed her up real quick
This is great! Very streamlined!
Saying no to eggs Benedict... Brad, how could you!
Yum! I'm gonna cook this!
I want her to cook me breakfast
"geez Louisiana" Alright, I'm sold.
Looks very good.. Well done.. My only critique is the constant raising inflections when speaking. Sorry.. just annoys the hell outta me.
😍
That valley-girl accent. Ugh.
Love this presentation, love the girl. :) Hi from Sweden.
gentle
Just like salt, a little Brad should be added to everything.
Molly is bae 😍 and should make more vids!
Love her method and energy but is anyone else getting put off by the "valley girl" accent? I'm just not used to hearing it so it detracts a bit from my enjoyment of the vid sorry
This video is basically a copy of kenji lopezs video when he is with Google
see this is the kinda shit I like. "Traditionally we'd do X but today we're gonna do Y"
If you are doing so many alterations on the original recipe, shouldn't you call it something else.
jeeze look at that ring+
You wish you had a Molly
So did Brad not want one? :(
Great, relaxing video. Nice contrast to have from the usual Brad, and solid content too.
Soooo, she basically made mayo with butter. Man I'm getting old.
Is that Brad in the background
I absolutely love the hollandaise sauce ingredients individually, yet the final product makes me gag. :(
Love eggs benedict, Molly made eggs benedict for breakfast, perfect!
Dammit Brad!! XD
So adorable. My god. Great cooking too
I wonder what eggs Benedict taste like I always want to order them and than never do
**swoon**
Molly please stop talking in valleys and hills , it's annoying.
yields.
Fuck Brad
Very nom nom! Eggs ben'o is good too
Molly seems like a great addition to the test kitchen videos. Clever prep-work!
God damn Americans and their cayene pepper... no just no There is no cayene in this dish at all........also a tip parma ham is amazing with it.
If you're telling Brad to be quite, you don't get it! Brad's army is here, lady!
Brad got salty
How dare you tell brad to be quiet. we shall burn you on a post for your treason
Wait is safe to eat the raw eggs in the hollandaise sauce?
Vinegar in the poaching water makes all the difference.
Annoying af
More Brad 😩
Looks goood, might have a craic at this
Brad dissed you eggs because you bitched him out earlier. Brad should have back handed you and said, THIS IS MY HOUSE!!
lol, Brad xD
Molly "Gently" Makes Eggs Benedict for a Crowd
I liked this vid! The end was funny af too.
Benedicts cool water bath? Isnt that some actor?
Who is Benedict?
Brad doesn’t eat eggs Ben?
It'S BrAd iN ThE BaCkGrOuNd!!1!
Didn't Half-Sour show us how to poach multiple poached eggs exactly the same way?
Who says no to Eggs Benedict?! I don’t think I can trust Brad anymore.
Eggs are evil. Many people don’t know this but, Trump isn’t building a wall to keep out the Illegals, he is building it to keep out the eggs!
Hi Brad.
hey, Brad!
You can put the hollandaise in a foam canister in warm water to keep it set and make it easily dispensable.
Common Brad, just taste the fricking eggbennies!
I'm totally going to try this.  Thanks
This channel is way better than Tasty
she's cute af
Molly looks fine 😍
Probably the first time I've seen a YouTube video from ba below 100 views
Ok.... WHERE'S CHRIS MOROCCO? Why are the harissa chicken thighs gone? I mean... good job on the new cute girl and trying to get Brad on her video and everything but I'm not sold by far.  Also, 1 minute reheating eggs was too much for many of those
She's hot af
Eggs Benedict are easier to make with a sous vide, just toss the eggs with the shell still on into the sous vide and then your hollandaise in a plastic bag and also toss that in the sous vide. Poaching eggs with the shells still on also makes them retain their egg shape.
She sounds like she's out of the cast of Mean Girls, not that it's a bad thing.
Molly = Eggs Bae 😍
❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹❤️❤️❤️❤️
a second of brad in a bon appetit video is better than most whole videos in youtube
First     To say: Meow Meow
