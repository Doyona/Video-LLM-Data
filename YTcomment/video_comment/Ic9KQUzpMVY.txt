What natural cleaners do you use around your home?
OMG I've been housekeeping for years and I never knew the power of waiting
Make your job easier their are two pins on top of the hinges push them & remove the door to save your back Great Vidio❤❤ thanks for the Lemon Juice hack
I have my bake to bake for mum's birthday. Do I have to use wire wool. I don't want to scratch the surface.
i would not put the metal scrubber to work here. i dont like scratching everything (personal preference) hence why i came to youtube looking for solution. Also baking soda is based and vinegar is acidic. Meaning they WILL neutralize each other. Most common solution ive found so far is baking soda and water paste, let it work a bit, then clean off the soda paste and finish with vinegar in a spray bottle and lastly damp towel. Also use sponge instead of metal one. Basically same ingredients, different recepie. Wont permanently scratch your oven and should work just as well.
If you push the element up it will usually stay up. Put racks in bathtub with hot water and 1-2 cups of sudsy ammonia to soak for a few hours. That stainless steel scrubbie then cleans it perfectly and easily if they soaked long enough. I used to soak overnight with the fan on. But now just a few hours.
I tried this and it works wonderfully!  Don’t feel bad about your oven being dirty it shows how great this works! Thank you for sharing 😊
Do you have trick for cleaning the glass door, between the glass and the gauge?
2:15 for the formula
Excellent 👌
Video starts at 2:00. You’re welcome
Thank you! Maybe a weird question, but does the steel wool not cause scratches? I’ve always been told not to use scratchy stuff to do oven glass cause it would crack.
Is distilled vinegar same as white vinegar ?🤔
Thank you so much!😊
Thank you saved me some money
Watched this video and followed your instructions- it’s been sitting for about 45 minutes. I think I’ll give it a few hours because it’s early I’m the day. And I’ll scrub it clean and let you know how it’s worked for me
Another note for everyone. I personally place alumimun foil on the bottom after I clean the oven which saves me time when I clean.
Loved this video and so happy not to use expensive cleaners!
How about under the top inside where is accumulated most the grass? Can I spray it as well ? Thanks!
1:12
Take care and thank you for your videos
What if it is a steam clean oven
What do you suggest for cleaning the cloth-like trim inside the oven door?
what are you using on the glass window?  Steel wool?
Thank you  I haven’t cleaned mine in 13 years because I’m burnt the elements so many times and it’s costly but I’m going to try again because you showed how ez it is …. Thank you so much
Amaze balls...I'll bet the lemon smells good too.
THANK YOU, I JUST GOING TO USE YOUR SECRET,  TENANTS JUST LEAVE MY PLACE .....
I would have thought that steel scrubber would scratch but guess not. I love those steel scrubbers! Thanks for showing us!
Which ingredients were used
Thank you, so much. It was time to clean my long overdue put-off oven cleaning and I used your method. It cleaned up great. No more expensive oven cleaners with nasty chemicals. I just love it.
Did you unplug the oven?
Thank you
Love your written comments. Thank you for being realistic. I have watched a bunch of oven cleaning videos and I am going with your method. 👍
Gonna try this one. Thanks
Wow that looked so easy. How do you keep the mix from leaving a powder film look
Yes! Ain't nobody got time to wait 12 hours lol
I’m sorry but I never saw you use the vinegar.  When do we have to add that in ?   You said  to save for later.
That’s crazy. Looks brand new. ✨  My hubby always hints The oven needs to be cleaned the oven the oven. I never and hate cleaning it. This motivated me. I want to surprise him lol 😂
I'll try this yaaay thank you so much!!!!
That's pretty cool can't wait to try this thank you for sharing new subscriber😍
That's pretty cool can't wait to try this thank you for sharing new subscriber😍
Thank you! I am going to try this now.
Worked like a charm. I used the self clean cycle which does a fantastic job, but it never gets the edges or window. This concoction did the trick and saved a lot of scrubbing. Thanks for the video. 👍
Thank you wow  great job
Pumice stone will take everything off.
It's the transparency and the convincingly way you promote natural cleaning for me!🙋👍
Did you know that you could take OFF the door for the oven😳 to make it easy for you to get in there & clean 😊👍🏾
Well, I  already like the little dance in the  beginning.
Omg lol my oven!
Heavy Duty aluminum foil the bottom under the element, it will make your cleaning much easier. Thank you for that recipe. :D
This video came to my rescue! Thank you for showing us how to clean our oven with healthy products love it!!! Feel more confident now!!
Wow! I thought the only way to really get this oven clean was using commercial oven cleaners. I didn't think the natural route would work for an oven. This is great! Thank you!
Very helpful. Thank you!
wow thank you for this helpful tutorial! I have been searching for one that wouldn't take me longer than an hour as it will probably need to get used tonight for dinner and I can't be sitting around for twelve hours so I'm happy I came across this. Def. subscribing!
Do you have any tips for cleaning an oven door and glass cover that opens out instead of down?
Vinegar and Dawn for entire bathrooms x2 And just about everything!
By far the BEST OVEN CLEANING VIDEO 😁 (I'm OCD a little lol)
Great job! Thanks for posting
Wonderful!!!! ThNk you so very much!!! I was in awe!!!!!
After that intro I had no choice but to subscribe.
How much vinegar?
I'm doing it this weekend, promise😄💖
You need to take the door off and split it to get inside
O don’t worry looks like mine🤣🤣🤣🤣and yes definitely I’m gonna try// thank you so much 👍👍👍👌👌👌👏👏👏
Add aluminum foil to the bottom can keep it clean longer then it's only spot treating.
nice info http://flyurlo.com/oAoXLrdi
Thanks for your video. It was really helpful. Great tip!
Thanks for showing us that we don't need to let it sit for an entire 12 hours 😅
Just wanted to let you know that I used your instructions (minus the lemon bcuz I didn't have any) the night before Thanksgiving bcuz the oven was so dirty it would smoke and I knew what was gonna happen when I cooked for T-giving.  Anyway, I made the paste but had to use straight water mixed with baking soda, then let it sit for 20 mins as I was in a rush, then I poured the white vinegar (no spray bottle either tho that would have worked best, less clean up), and let that sit for 15 mins.  Because I didn't have a spray bottle I had to pour the vinegar on, which meant I couldn't close the door otherwise it would have drained on the floor.  Hence, I didn't want to let the oven door open that long so I shortened up the vinegar soak time.  Anyway, I used a little scrubber like yours and most of that junk came right off.  Even without the lemon and letting mine sit for less time, I was quite happy with the result.  Though there are a few tiny spots here and there, it worked like a charm, and I didn't have to scrub that hard or for very long.  Worked great on the window, too.  Really glad I found your post, it saved the day for us.
Amazing I’m gonna try that too/ my oven is gross too so thank you so so much in advance//
Good job, Ms Kreative!!!
Wow. I make a natural counter and floor cleaner with vinegar. I put orange peel cloves cinnamon lavender or whatever herbs or spices I want in a mason jar and cover with vinegar. Store in pantry for two or three weeks giving it a shake every couple days. Makes a pleasant smelling all purpose cleaner.
Great solution!  I wonder if before you do that you were to warm the oven first, like put it at 250 degrees, then shut it off, and when cooled some, do your procedure. You might need to scrub less.

Thanks for making a very helpful (& entertaining) DIY Vid!! My oven is a "self-cleaning" oven but it never does a thorough job & they say never to use chemical cleaner in a self-cleaning oven, but I'm sure your mixture will work wonders! Thanks again!
Thank you for showing me how to clean my oven. I’m afraid to use the self-cleaner because the oven gets so hot I’m afraid it will start a fire.
Scrub pad scratches doesn't it
if i remember correctly the bottom element can be lifted up and it stays till you put it down
Dang, I need to do this!!
Good job thanks! I absolutely hate my oven cleaner !! its dangerous.
I will need to try this my oven is long overdue to be clean 😳😳
I will definitely use the ingredients you've listed. I always hated cleaning my oven because of the harmful chemicals. I will be moving next month and need this oven to be spotless. Thanks!
I'm definitely going to try this. We have a self cleaning mode on our oven but since I've never cleaned the oven (I keep putting it off since I don't know how to do it yet) it's a hazard to use the self cleaning mode. Trying a steam bath to get some of the gunk off but with a year's worth of gunk in there I don't have high hopes XD thank-you for this great cleaning method really hoping it works for me ^.^
Does the scrubber scratch the glass? If not what type of scrubber is it?
I just use a hand held steamer - it cleans and sanitizes with out any chemicals or gross smells ( A lot of people can't stand the smell of vinegar) it takes less time and less elbow grease! Been doing mine that way for 10 years I raised birds and still have my pet Parrot and I can't use chemicals or an auto cleaner on the oven.... works like a charm I use it on everything - from the oven, to stove top, sinks, faucets, counter tops, fridge, freezer, toilet, tubs and showers, my kitchen table  I bought mine at Aldi's grocery store for $20 they're sold just about every where even online I've even seen them for $10 to 15 bucks. doesn't need to be anything fancy either :)   I do have a question though why is it everyone who makes these videos always starts with putting the "cleaner" on the door, knowing they have to actually get into the stove to put it on there, then you wear half (or more) of what you put on the door lol why not do the door last :)
Well detailed. Does the aluminum ball thing scratch the glass door?
My bottom doesn't get dirty because I cover my oven racks with foil.  I usually put one of the racks on the last groove near the bottom of the oven floor and it collects all the crap.  However the sides and door is always dirty so this helps a lot.
She never lists the ingredients but must be baking soda, vinegar and ???. What click bait this dumbo is.
the steel wool didn't scratch the glass ? awesome
This natural oven cleaner looks looks so good, it did it job perfect something to try and make at home. Thanks for sharing this idea, sending Monthly love.
This is brilliant, I definitely need to try this!! We use all natural cleaners mostly DIY in our home too!  I've posted a few videos of the ones I make but this one is new so thank you, I love it!
Great job ! I use alot of Mrs Myers products ! I use the self cleaning option on my oven. But I'm just lazy like that. Loved your video
Natural cleaners are so much better. THAT WORKED ANAZINGLY! Good thing now you don’t have to hide that dirty little secret.
Wow, I didn't even know there was such a thing as Natural Oven Cleaner, I'm so glad it's not something I have to worry about yet but thanks so much for sharing.
This is awesome ! Tfs ! I wish I knew this before lol new subscriber ❤️
My oven is a hot mess too!  I hate cleaning it because of the fumes, but I'll definitely try this.
I need to do this asap!
Looks like it's coming up pretty easily now!
I have never seen it with lemon juice, just vinegar! Thanks for sharing!
This is great info. i had no idea about it. I definitely give this a try. Thanks for sharing.
This looks like something I’d really love to try...to pass on to someone else to do. Lol. That before and after was dramatic though. I know it had to be very satisfying to get it done. Nice job. (-Mommy Seed, Nikki)
Wow! That worked so well! Gotta try it!!
That did look a lot better at the end.  I wonder if a self-cleaning oven would be even easier.  Did you really get all that done with just one scrubber?
My oven is SO BAD it’s embarrassing 😂 I’ll have to try it.
Your oven...amazing. My oven was a hot mess from the holiday. I just cleaned mine 2 weeks ago. Great video. Thank you for sharing.
I must try this. I have used an ammonia formula and it sucked! (For me anyway) Yeah, it did the job and looked fantastic BUT for a few days the house totally STUNK. Not fun. This one looks really good though. Thanks for sharing xo Monthly
I have been looking for something like this for ages! Awesome video ❤️
Do you think lining the bottom of the oven with heavy duty aluminum foil will help keep it from getting so cruddy over time?
