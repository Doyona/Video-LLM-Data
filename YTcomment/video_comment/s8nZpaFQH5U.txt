I am going to get the stuff, can't wait
I’m obsessed as well and have made it for breakfast and dinner too. I feel amazing after drinking it. Perfect pre workout smoothie.
Could I use frozen spinach since i can't seem to find fresh during this quarintine ?>!? And if so about how much ?
Are you still having the Fab 4 Smoothies? If so, I'm wondering what protein powder you prefer?
Thank you for the recipe I made it! Held me over for so long and tasted great with sun warrior raw protein powder (French vanilla), I added barley grass juice powder as well :) I may get some mint leaves and add those for a variation... loved the refreshingness of the 🍋! Thank you 🙏
How are you liking the smoothies still? Are you still drinking them? I’m starting my first one today!! Listening to her book now :)
I just found your channel. Thanks for this recipe and the link to the stainless steel straw. I used to be intimidated with chlorophyll in powder or liquid form but I'll give it a try next time.
Love this! I'm excited to get started.
This was so informational loved it!!!!!!
