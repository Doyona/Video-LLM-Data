I like the look of that sauce
Sorry but what the White sauce called in 2:03 ?
I would put this on ice-cream in a heartbeat!
"Cherry Sauce" is inspired by the recent trip to Michigan. It is perfect for poultry, pork, fish and even ice cream.   If you are interested in the recipe, here is the link to my website: http://www.youcancookgourmet.com/recipesPages/sauce/cherrySauce.htm  I would love to know what you think. Thank you! Joyce
