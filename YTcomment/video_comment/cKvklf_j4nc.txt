honey most of your links gives back errors? =(
Hi how many inches you chose between each button?
Thank you
As long as you like it that's ok, but if you pay a professional and it looks like the one you just did,  will you pay that person and be happy the way it looks? To be honest that look CHEAP and AWFUL. learn the craft and then teach others how to do it the right way and learn how to use a drill. Thanks!!
What kind of staple gun was used and what inch staple
I love it <3 does any fabric goes with tufted headboard??
Came out BOMB 💕💕💕
This is pretty i wish i could just pay someone to do mine for me. What did you use as a bedrails? My bedroom set is black
How do you attach it to the bed?
Giiiirl this is gorgeous!
Is the fabric grey or a tan color because the link you provided say taupe ?
Awesome headboard. I only  wish that you added a video on how to apply the brackets. I didn't know that you can purchase them.

I love it.  my one question.  I'm having a hard time with measurements.  what should be my measurements when going to home depot to purchase the plywood?  I want it to be the same width and height as yours.  sorry for such a dumb question. that's the problem I'm running into right now

I absolutely love your video!   I've watched it practically 10 times!  Your video is the only one that I have come across that explains how you did the diamonds.  Simple and inexpensive (no cost.....I  have plenty at  home)!   Use a  DVD case!  I plan to make this headboard  while I have downtime during Christmas holidays.  Wish me luck!
Did you connect your bed rails to it or just let it lean against the wall ?
Love love it
It looks beautiful where did you buy your diamonds buttons and also where did you purchase the fabric and basically everything you need and more or less how much did everything cost if you don't mind me asking because me and my husband are planning on making one very soon would really appreciate it if you let me know ASAP as possible thanks and love your videos
How did you put the legs on? Just nailed it! The nails won't poke through the headboard?
new sub.. loved it !!
Great job, thanks for posting! :-)
New subscriber
Very, very beautiful!!!
Where did you get the foam?
Nice work
You did a great job.
Very nice, definitely going to make mine! How is the headboard able to stay upright against the wall without tilting or anything like that
It came out beautiful!!!
Hello there, wow I'm so glad we found this video. Very useful. May I know how you can be reached for a very important inquiry? Thanks
great job! what kind of staple pattern did you use to keep the buttons down?
gorgeous
I love it!! How long did it take?
Hello what we're the sizes for the wood . I love how big the wood is . Please advise 😘❤️
Hi love your way of doing it thank you for uploading. I have a few question why did you put 2 fabrics is there any difference? Do you think i can glue the foam to the board with hot glue?
Beautiful!  Thank you for sharing.
Beautiful
How did you do the measurements for the buttons
Is this for a queen size? & if so what size is your wooden board? Loved this DIYS , new subbie!!
I actually have a couple questions =) I currently have a MALM ikea bed frame this it it for reference. ( http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S69009475/)  and I want to change it. I saw in some DIY that I can add height to it with adding some extra wood on top and then covering it up.  I know that Ikea wood is cheap to do you think i can drill holes in it to do the buttons ? and what kind of fabric did you use?  how much  fabric do you recommend for a queen size bed? Thanks in advance.
What measurement plywood did u use??? And is it a queen size bed
This is beautiful..
So gonna do this love it!
loving your headboard, you did such an amazing job 😊. what is the measurements (L/W)  for your headboard?
You did a great job but do to attach the rail to the head board or is the bed just pushed up against it?
Looks nice, what size is your head board. My bed is a king size and I want to extend the head board a little longer so that it looks over sized.
Such a great video! I love these diy ideas because some of these head boards are too expensive lol ! Just got a new subbie here! Would love if you checked my channel out! I just started this youtube life and would love tips and advice. XOXO -Cindy :)
Hi CARESS , I plan on doing this headboard but I wanted to ask you for the specific name or color you used for your velvet fabric? I LOVE THAT COLOR! I want it mine exactly like yours... Thanks for posting this video!
{angela ratlin} hope you see this I do not know why it would not let me reply to your comment! But this is the frame I have Walmart #: 007135903 just copy and paste this to your search engine. I wrapped fabric around the two legs that you see in the video and just post it against the wall so my mattress and frame is holding it in place it is not going anywhere lol hope this helps, Thanks for watching♡♡♡♡   http://www.walmart.com/ip/Spa-Sensations-Steel-Smart-Base-Bed-Frame-Black-Multiple-Sizes/15739163?action=product_interest&action_type=title&item_id=15739163&placement_id=irs-106-m2&strategy=PWVAV&visitor_id&category=&client_guid=58a92b0e-bf63-4a91-989c-d6ded8e813bd&customer_id_enc&config_id=106&parent_item_id=41974839&parent_anchor_item_id=41974839&guid=b0815278-1d20-4037-aaab-47018ef3aecd&bucket_id=irsbucketdefault&beacon_version=1.0.1&findingMethod=p13n
Omg! I love this! But you lost me when you started putting the buttons on! So you put strings on the buttons  right! Then put it in the hole! This so cool
i wanted to know if you have a metal bed frame and of so how did you attach the headboard to the metal frame? I am  in love with this headboard OMG ! thanks for this great tutorial
OMG What a savings, my husband and I could do that. If he would lol
So beautiful! I love it! 👍🏻 👍🏻👍🏻😀

Beautiful color choice.  What size bed was the headboard made for?
What size bed does the headboard fit?  Also, what are the dimensions of your plywood, batting and fabric?  Thanks and side note...you did a Wonderful JOB!
i am from India. and I loved it soo much. I'm making one. ☺
Love it 😍
Great tutorial! What size did you use? and where did you get your bed rails and everything else to hold up your bed?

Hello Cynthia henry  sorry about that was trying to reply to your message and accidentally deleted it smh but here is the updated link to the buttons  hope you see this :)  https://www.amazon.com/Headboard-Upholstery-Crystal-Buttons-Diameter/dp/B012V1MZUI/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1467992606&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=dimond+buttton
Best tufted headboard tutorialever! Helped me a lot. Can you please tell me what was the total cost?
Hey! Your headboard looks amazing! I am about to start on mine pretty soon and your video has been very helpful! I was just wondering what size your bed is? Mine is a king and I'm afraid the fabric HL has available won't be long enough once I start tufting.
omg yesss new subbie love it!
U kn I will😁. Ima do it July or Aug when we move,so excited!!!
Just added to the todo list!!! So pretty❤❤
Nice work/Lookng forward to see more of your great ideas👍Super!
That turned out good. I will have to do this DIY this summer.
Just found your channel and I love it! Can't wait to see more of your work!
