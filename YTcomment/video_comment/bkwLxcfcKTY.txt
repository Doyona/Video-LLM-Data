Why do you do syrup with the sugar instead of adding the sugar straight away?
They are beautiful and peachy and they look so good like any other Macaron 😋🍑
Thanks dude! I am so bring these for Thanksgiving!! My fam thanks u for the awesome recipe! Happy holidays to u!
Hi Nick, can you please let me know where to buy the peach essence? Or the brand. Thank you
This looks so tasty!

How do I swap almond flour for flour?
Help please!!! I have oil based food colour, can I use it for macarons???
Thank you very much for the video!  Beautiful !!! Can you give me the link to where you bought your peach essence?
My fave fruit 🍑🍑🍑
I have seen the recipe on his website and it says it makes enough for 30...does anyone know if that means 30 shells or 30 complete macaron sandwiched cookies?
This may be a strange question, but how come you have to put a syrup into the meringue when you make macarons?
This is the first time I tried this macarons method, any body know why my macarons skin is all wrinkled after baked? I did left the shell dried to touch , and the feet has developed during baking. it’s just having wrinkled skin :(
This is a nice recipe but can you also make this without using the Italian method? Will it make a difference? I am not really into the hot syrup stuff. lol
You should do peppermint macarons
Matcha 🍵 macarons
Matcha 🍵 macarons
Matcha 🍵 macarons
Delicious!
Your next question can be about your recipes..,like when is the macaron perfectly done? Or like how many recipes of mine have you baked?
Love these alot! So cuteeee!! Keep up the amazing work!!!!
please do grinch cupcakes or maroons!
You should ask what did everyone what to be when they where younger!? I generally wanted to be a MERMAID! with lots of GLITTER!
Hi Nick, I have a question  I'm a beginner on this and I saw few videos how to make macarons and I saw you doing the syrup with the sugar granulated and mixed with the meringue and I saw other persons mixing the granulated sugar straight  with the meringue what form is better or correct or both are?
Do you think a hollow macaron is bad (or not correct)? Somebody said that macaron shouldn't be like that. But my macarons are always hollow and they are still taste good and pretty.
Gingerbread macaroons 😍
😍😍😍😍
I love to ask people this question: Sea anemone or Venus flytrap?
I love to ask people this question: Sea anemone or Venus flytrap?
Hey! You should ask ~ What is your favorite themed treat? Or What is your fave flavor of sweet!. Im from the USA and I have been subscribed to you for 2 months now. Love You Much!
Hahaaa the last comment was hilarious :D!!  Mmm questions... What is the funniest/weirdest thing you have ever done? Who would you like to marry? haha looove those peach macarons they look adorable!!! 😀😀😀😻😻😻💜💜💜
He sounds like James Charles with an accent
Nick these look soooo adorable, i love peaches and these look sooo sweet!!! send some over to London please ) x
Oh my, these look so yummy, love the colours and the fruitiness! 😊
NOOO! These ingredients are way too expensive 😂✋️😏
I have got to try this! I'm over basic macarons lol
"No, these ingredients are too expensive to show you guys how to ruin a macaron recipe" 😂😂😂
TRENDING
Those look... "tasty"
Ahhh thanks for reading my comment, I’m screaming!! My name is username is Kimizuru 💗 I like the idea of using jelly in the middle of the macarons 🍑
These look gorgeous, Nick! I’d love to see you make a “Reese’s” flavour! With maybe a salted element to it to balance out those sweet and nuttiness of the original flavors :)
Wow...
Yummy 😋
Can't even pronounce Macarons right...
You are the best♥♥♥♥♥♥
will there be a video about the melbourne baking class ?! it looked like so much fun
QUESTION:  how many striped shirts do you have? bc i think its kinda rubbing on me bc half of my closet now is full of striped shirts
what is everyones favorite dessert?
You should ask:                             What is your worst baking failure?
Can you please make Sonic the Hedgehog cupcakes?
wow amazing
🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑
your question should be what is your favourite macaron and why
You should've pipe them into the shape of a peach. Still great though
Omg Nick 😲👏👐💯😍😙🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑!! Amazing. So much luv from ur lil Ga 🍑. Q- If you could live anywhere besides AU, where would it be and why. 💚💚💚💚💚
Your question should be: what is the craziest thing that happened on Christmas? (Since it's holiday season)
Does leaving the whipped egg whites alone for about an hour cause it to deflate faster? Mine deflated too fast before I even finished mixing it through so mine was too thin n didn't rise
Would using organic food coloring change the outcome of the macarons?
TRENDING!!!
...makeup is expensive & plenty of youtubers go on to show what you shouldn't do &/or how to fix.
No, not authentic at all. Why are you trying to adulterate a beautiful art form?
So innovative!
It’s 2017 I’m sure people can google and find macaron mixture that has been over mixed
You should make an orange cupcake with orange cotton candy on it
I don’t have any question ideas you can ask but I’m wondering, what do you do with all of the leftover food you make?  P.S. I don’t know if you’ve said it before but I’m curious lol😊
Christmas themed macarons
why not use cheaper ingredients then so people can see what might happen.
Man this is guy is so weird...
You should include like a sped up video of recipe at the end of the  video :)
That's so creative
HOW DO YOU TAKE SUCH AMAZING PICTURES OF YOUR TREATS OMG
Ask what our favourite food is
What do you do when it's raining and you can't see anything because fog is coming in from the north, and you can't hear your mother calling you for dinner because you're on top of a hill twenty miles east because you had to look for some magical berries that only grow in high and dry places, and you need the berries for your sciatica because it's getting out of hand, but you fall down the hill as you start heading home because the hill is slippery, and all of the berries are gone because the old witch lady from down the road stole them for a potion that she's making to turn everyone into frogs so she can take over the tri-state area?
You should get exotic foods/candy from the world and make a series off of it!
He aint that good lookin but.. ..godamn it looks amazing af
Nick you are always amazing
Hey everyone!  Hope everyone is having a good day! :)
HALLELUJAH THANK YOU FOR FINALLY DOING SOMETHING PEACH!
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO FOREVER! YAY 😍😍😍☺️❤️❤️🍑🍑🍑
Thank you for showing me something I will never make or want to make guy who’s channel just found out about.
Im happy this was on trending 😁 subbed
I saw the last comment and was about to reply! so funny!
Hi Nick - how do you change the colors on your work tables and tile behind you?  I have noticed that you have had at least two different colors for each of them.  Thanks!
If you could perect any task/talent in the world, (ex. Piano, baking, sewing) what would you want to achieve?
These are so cute! This is the first time I've seen anyone make macarons like this. I'm going to try to make them! Thank you 😄
Another fantastic recipe!  Thanks, Nick !
If u find 1 million dollars what would u do? Or what is ur favorite type dessert?
Can you ship some of those to the states? Philadelphia to be exact?!?
Nick you can ask about the most funniest thing that ever happened while cooking.
"If you could relate yourself to a kitchen utensil, what would you be and why?"
U really out did yourself who agreesj
What is your favorite dessert and why?
No 2018 calendars??
Spumoni macarons would be cool. Cherry, pistachio, and chocolate. Or that would be good as a freak shake cupcake. :)
wait... how did you achieve the gradient on the macrons?
You look like sam smith
These just look so yummy!
Idea: if you can mix any two of your cupcake and macaroon recipes what would it be (it cannot be the highway unicorn)
The master of macaroons
this totally should be on trending totally justified
Oohh peaches. How about peaches and cream. Havent recalled seeing you do that yet
nick, can u do watermelon macaroons?
please do more vegan recipes :(
The amount of times you say pop though
1. United States 🇺🇸 2. Fall/Autumn 🍂 3. The clothes, shoes, food and weather
These are so pretty
what is our favourite recipe of yours?
You should ask what everyone’s favorite flavor is for each season.
Hey nick ♡ I really want to make some of your macaroons but I'm worried about the syrup ... Could you please give us some tips how to clean the syrup of or isn't it needed ? Love from Germany ♡
i love the colours!
Yum! What about a bourbon peach cupcake? Or chai peach cupcake!?
Do cherry cherry boom boom Macaroons
What 90s series that didn’t make it out of the 90s or 00s (TV, video game franchise, ...anime...) would you like to see rebooted is one question! ❤️ Ofc I stole it from an OutsdiseXbox livestream so, before anyone clocks me...... 👀
Neither your video or the recipe says how much is in each portion of egg whites. Recipe states "110g liquefied egg whites (see below)" however, there is nothing "below" and no specification given in the written steps. Just "portion". Can you please clarify? :)
These are cute!
Hi❤️ I'm from israel❤️❤️❤️
You should ask what everyone's favorite animals are and if they had to only pet one of them for the rest of their life what animal would it be
In your next video you should ask us what to ask you in your next video again xD
Question idea: What was your funniest/worst holiday baking story?  I tried making macarons but never got anything to turn out like yours. The recipe I used was very different from your recipe though. I may have to try again because I'd love to try to do one of your recipes. They look wonderful!
They're pretty hollow though...
How about asking what everyone's favorite holiday dessert is and making a macaroon out of the most popular one.
Favorite holiday treat😋
I think a good question would be favorite comfort food in the country you live in.
This is kind of cute tbh... I'd like to taste them
You should make a mango key lime pie? 🤤
Can you make blueberry flavored macarons?
You should ask "what flavor macarons next?" and challenge yourself to create a hybrid version of the two voted most popular! ;)
This is so beaitiful ❤
Do u eat all the macaroons after each video ?
Can you make starfruit macrons please
Isn't 180°C too hot? :o even when i bake them at 160°C for 10 minutes they get brownish, i dont know if something is wrong with my oven or something.
Your question will be .. Can I know why you are following and watching The Scran Line?  For me .. You are the King of desserts, Cupcakes, cookies, Cakes and macarons ...etc You have your own wonderful style of making and photographing desserts feeling satisfaction, we never get bored! In Fact we need more of your creativity, You are the best 👍😘 All love and respect from Saudi Arabia..Xoxo❤🌹

Nick maybe take some mixture from the good batch and mess that up.. So we can see You need not run the whole batch!! :P
name a place, object and one of nick's cupcakes,   now make a story......     :D
say the first thing that comes into your mind. or what is the first thing that comes into your mind?
I love your videos 😘 I made macarons before and yeah ingredients are expensive.
Do anyone ever make his stuff?
This looks like the makeup palate
Love your shirt Nick
Talking of simpsons... Why don't you ask the question "What was your favourite childhood cartoon and why?" It would be lovely to share some nostalgia 😊
How do you prevent crystallisation when making the sugar syrup??!!❤
People's fave colors .. People don't ask that anymore
Chicken nugget macarons
Looks awesome!
It is not a question but you could ask your followers  1. What is their favorite taste 2. What is their least favorite taste and 3. Combine them to a cake or any other sweet treat
They’re so bootyful
Hey Nick! I have a question for you.  What is your favourite shirt to wear? The stripy one or the other stripy one? 😂 💕
You’re question should be, why tho? 🤔
Random Question: Do you sell your cupcakes/macarons after baking? In South Africa Almond Flour and Eggs are extremely expensive, so it costs a pretty penny to experiment with baking. BUT i must say, i used your macaron technique and it worked out first time :) so i'm really grateful for all your macaron videos. Much appreciated.
What’s your favorite weird flavor combo?
how many macroon shells does this batch make? :)
Make matcha macaroons
Your question should be if you could have any super power, what would it be?         Mine would be to be able to eat whatever I want without any consequences. ;u;
What’s the biggest fear you have as a baker? And why?  Why does almond flour have to be so expensive?!?! 😩  Also can you make different Macarons? Like with coconut flour for those who are allergic to nuts. And other nut flours? Like cashew or pistachio flour?
The way the jelly fit in was so SaTiSfyInG?
Question: Do you like to bake? How come? What do you bake?
I'm terrible at making questions but maybe: What is the best anecdote that you can not forget? Silly or not
You should do matcha macaroons.👍
What is your favorite Tv show?
Cutest macaroons I've laid my eyes on!!😍😍
Yum😋😋 You make the best desserts ever 😁💜
These are GORGEOUS HUN
If you were to be a macaron, what kind would you be and why?😁
What is your craziest fear for the next question maybe?
Pepper mint swirl macarons for christmas
The technic used to do meringue can be used to do Macarons too? Sorry If it's a repeat question - ( watch and re-watch all of your macarons videos and hopefully one day I'll get to do it... I live in Haiti and let me tell you other than the eggs everything else cost so much that I could feed my family of 6 for a week so there's my hesitation 😂)
can you make a cannoli cake/cupcake ? please :)
I love peach 🍑🍑🍑
Beautiful!
looks sooooo delicious 😋❤️
Well you don’t need to Ruin it accidentally just show us some failed footage of you making them.
Your videos are the ultimatum of satisfaction! Love every one of them! Hello from India🙋
