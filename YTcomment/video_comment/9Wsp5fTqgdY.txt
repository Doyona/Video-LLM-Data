Using skill and tools within means of reach to make what others would apply specific tools to have, this helps in cost cutting for bigger results.
Watching that table saw part stresses me out. Shakey “slasher flick” double speed camera shot, no push sticks or safetys. Oof.
Woow👌🏻 your work is inspirational and helpful 😊
Woodglut is full of amazing tips. It helped me a lot.

You know, I've been looking for hours for someone who does this. Fantastic video. I've got 10 doors in my house with glass in that I want to replace with wood.
Good job...!
Nice video. Love your work. What do you think about these plans? https://870hans-cd953.gr8.com/
muy buen video saludos cordiales
Nice job and very clever. Thanks for sharing👍
I love to build cabinets, but I have built a FREE  online ordering + designing  system where you can buy all your custom cabinets, closets, and cabinet components, all you would do is assemble at home or the shop. (Any wood species, profiles, textured melamine's, boxes and more)
Good
J'aime bien merci
Great video thanks

Hi, love watching your channel, I'm big on DIY, currently I'm building a tiny house. You guys should come check us out!
Awesome, thanks for sharing
it colds blood looking how close of saw you work o.O
Please updet video in Hindi
good job iam finishing carpenter from india sir iam apply your company
Like a Casket.
Woooo , this guy is not afraid to accidentally cut his FINGERS , there should be firstly the safeguards in place MAN before you touch the table saw or any tools .... DANGER ....
It really hard work, what i suggest is that we can buy the beautiful one.
I always love do it yourself videos!

good
I like your channel alot
Do yourself a big favor and buy yourself a shaper. It will make you work a lot easier and quicker.It's also more accurate.

I am a carpenter looking for a job is it to help
Υour hands are too close to the machine. Be carefull! Anyway, very nice work and nice technique!
You are first man who used gloves for gluing. Very clear job!
thanks
what glue are you using?
spindle speed?
good job borther
Thanks
wow i am really glad i saw this i am from Trinidad and raised panel cutters are expensive so thanks you saved me a lot of money and frustration plus i can adjust the angles to my liking ....oh the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB8FmXwmnns&list=PLEV2BLOX8A5NmmCXNYksUiS2W0Zg2YjNP&index=4 was beautyfully done
Good videos
i love your doors :-)
This is too painful to watch.  OMG   If you plan on making doors invest in a set of door making bits.
what kind of angle is on the wood base you place the panel thank you is really nice....
good
👍🏻great
I like your channel alot. Subscribed \m/
iDoStuff can I ask whats angle is there at this jig base? Im working on my own jig based on your video. Thanks
outstanding job !
Sangat jenius(simpel job
my bad..i watched your video and commented without even reading the other posts...i was glad to see others with the same observations. I'm not a hater my friend..i'm just a guy that thinks if your going to post a how to video for the whole world to see..either you or the guy posting it..somebody needs to pass the pipe. it would be different if you were showing how to fluff a pillow..maybe you should consider that.
first of all i want to say that your an idiot.. second that your extremely lucky with your cavalier attitude with the proximity of your fingers to high powered cutting blades. it's not so much you that i worry about..you obviously have experience..thus no fear..and as such i wonder how many people that watch your videos try to replicate your video and slip up not being as experienced with fingertips so close to high speed cutting blades. you might be a rockstar when it comes to cutting wood..but you suck at being a responsible instructor ..one last thing..i've lived long enough to see even seasoned vets have a bad day from life's distractions...one we call lefty...the other affectionately ...lucky be responsible an post safety first.
whats the diff between the usual wood glue and the polyurethane wood glue?
The 'top-down' filming style coupled with the high speed made this impossible to watch.  A shame as I enjoyed your other ones.
Why not just use biscuits to join the wood?
@  3:30 Your tape messed up? Do you mean you messed up using the tape?
I thought the panels were supposed to sit in a rebate inside the frame of the door traditional, rather than just putting beading on to hold the panels
Hands *way* too close to spinning cutters for me. No guards. No riving knives (table saw)  No push sticks, No featherboards ? . Don't try that at home kids.
great detail.
Dat great, but is this very essy
you make things look easy my friend Great job
me gusta ver todos los videos acerca de trabajos con madera y  las técnicas que usan, muy originales...
Great job. Excellent pre-planning and very innovative thinking skills. If you aren't a carpenter, then you have excellent hand skills for a beginner. I found it quite interesting doing what you did with what you had. Excellent.
rất kỹ thuật
hay
why  done it with the cnc router machine ,and can change the bit tool for different effect
If you have a router table, I'm sure you have a table saw. So, Why not just cut them quick on the table saw?
it colds blood looking how close of saw you work o.O
good, good
Thanks
Goegraphically fairly close (especially compared to USA distances) but very different.  It'll be Derbyshire you are picking up on, specifically NE Derbyshire, even though most round here think I talk a bit posh.  We are just over the Pennies from Manchester and close to Sheffield, Yorkshire but the accents are quite different.
Hi Graeme, The link in the description take you to iDoStuff home page. click on "Making a front door, a step by step, how to guide" Then  "Part 6",  It's not a full set of plans but it explains / shows it more detail so you should be a able to knock a jig together that does the same thing but for the angle and size that you need. Cheers
Nice work with the router, do you have plans for the jig as it is some thing that I would like to try build. I make some of my raised panel doors with the table saw and I have a set of router bits for raised panel doors but what you have done with a straight router bit is really cool.
Nice work. Is that a Manchester accent? Just a curious Yank.
Good products
muy amable muchas gracias mañana voy hacer y despues te cuento
Gracias Juan, Google Fresas traduce como un tipo de fruta de verano :). La fresa que he usado es una recta de 20 mm
Fresas=bits
El ángulo puede ser cualquiera para adaptarse a su diseño. Estos fueron unos 10 grados. Usted está resticted por el diseño de la cuchilla. Sentimos la traducción no funciona en su segunda pregunta "fresas"? Gracias por su atención, espero que esto ayude.
esta buenisimo me podrias pasar los angulos que le diste a la inclinacion de la plantilla? y que fresas ocupas? desde ya muchas gracias
Thank TheBrik2, it's good to be able to ideas.
Simple but effective and. Thank for posting. Given me more ideas!
Fantastic joint, I wish I seen this when I glued boards together for a table... no need for a biscuit jointer
thank you
comprate una tupi que te puedes morir para hacer una puerta
That would be interesting to see.  Does it give you single chamfer?
QUE BIEN
Good idea, I could put together a galley on the iDostuff site
Yw!
Ah that's clearer, if you can explain what you think makes it awful it might add a bit more to the discusion.
Awful!
Not quite sure if that means its "good". I'm not well up youth speak.
What a ballsed up way of doing woodwork!
vuenos
Thanks for the comment. Yes there are bits available, and it would be simpler to use one. The downside of bought bits is you are restricted to the profiles they manufacture and for one off jobs the cost is prohibitive.  Using this technique allows you to design the profile for the job and not the other way round and it's basically free.  Cheers
Thank you very much for your vid. I just wanted to say that there is a router bit that does that shape all in one pass. No need to jig (even though your jig is cool). Would help you get quite a few doors done much faster. Thanks again
I only had these two pannel to do at the time so it never crossed my mind. With a bit of thought I could come up with a clever adjustable jig although the simplest way would be to fit packers under the back to change the angle.
thats a lot of work but great jig. how do you cope with different thickness panels etc which will alter angle. does it mean making new jig everytime?
Thanks Shaggyone, you beat me to it. He's now banned and the comment deleted.  I'll not delete any real criticism, its adds to our collective knowledge. But abuse like his is worthless.
Nice router jig.
Hey jaywc3333, how in the hell did you wind up here? Did you get lost searching for festool videos?  It just goes to show, any wanker with a keyboard can post comments... bad comment Jay,  bad comment.
not bad
Have a look at the iDoStuff site (link in the video description - the page you need is the last step of "Making a front door, a step by step, how to guide") It should explain it all. If not give me another shout and I'll try and explain.
Hay, that looks like my bridgewood sliding router table.  Well done.
Cool .. :)
Thanks Wingman. The other advantage of the technique is that your not stuck with profiles of the dedicated bits.  If the design calls for steeper angle or longer profile it can be done. Cheers
Wow. All this to avoid buying a raised panel bit set? Good tutorial. Most would assume though that anyone into woodworking has a shaper and the bits for jobs like this. No harm in showing us how it's done without thought. Good job!
Sell the camera and buy the bit!
nice   work i  admire
@dmioefk yep most of the interior pro guys hiding the best wood working plans from the public. and a friend of mine working with Top Class furnitures said these designs are the main models for attractive wooden furnitures and wooden crafts. get the best one here  ==> bit.ly/LH3ldO?=uvbczb
I do custom work. It's ALL new for me. Some people are impatient. And wonder why I haven't started yet. Little do they know, I have hours in it already.  Thanks
That's certainly true, especially when it's something new for you. I spend a good while thinking is the best, easiest, way of achieving the results I'm after with the resources I have.  This process gives me a vision of the result then it's just a case of carrying out the steps I've imagined.    Sometimes when the results aren't critical its fun to dive and see what happens just for a a bit variety eg. Two Wheel Tractor but thats a totally different kind of project
good points. But you missed one. I find that the longer you think about a project, the better, and easier it becomes.  Build it on paper, a computer, and or in your head many times. Then when the actual build comes, it's gravy train~! IMHO of course :-P Nice job on the demo & project by the way.
You are right. The panels could have fitted in a groove. The design could be adapted to do that. However because I was using the big mouldings, that do the job, I choose to cut out that step and simplify the job. Cheers.
I like the trend of thought in this, & here in America 3-4 years ago this is very true, but I've noticed something with folding doors, they used to be made out of solid pine, then that press board stuff, now they make it out of cardboard for $47-$80. (Because the corporation know they'll stick ya for it) For cardboard!!!! Not including the cheap hardware at about $8... Now I like wood, in fact I also like things made right too, & by your reasoning, it will equal out to a "Real" door.
WEEEE careful--watch those fingers on the table saw!!!   Nice way to knock out some doors. Still a lot of work, doors always are, but worth it with nice wood.
@bzarmy, It's likely that you'll get marks for how well you can plan the job, drawings are to pass the course not make the door.  It's a skill you might need in the future and comes in handy for more complex jobs: to workout materials, to present a design, to workout how to make it, to explain how it should be made (others might be making parts of it).  In a commercial situation you could need these kind of skills to take a step up from the shop floor. Get as many skills as you can. Good luck.
@odmcarp, Thanks. You're right it's a low cost DIY solution, it takes longer than using standard bits. To get the size I wanted would have needed custom cutters on a spindle moulder, out of the question for me with such small quanities. It's a alternative technique that gets the job done proving you don't always to spend to get results. I hadn't really thought about it being safer, but guess you right, less can go pear shaped with a smaller cutter in the hands of the less experienced. Cheers.
I like doors.
@blzbub1 , You're quite right it would be easier to just buy a door. I always look at this kind of thing as a balance between time and money. If I can put the time in I don't need the money. Using £250 as a start, I would have to earn around £360 before tax. Buying an imported door at £250 minus  VAT, distributor, shipping etc. might only be worth £100. I'm not sure where I'm going with this but It's a thought anyway.
While it's nice to have the traditional skills, the World is now a different place and it's impossible to compete commercially with the far eastern door factories, where they churn out a raised panel door in minutes. I guess you would have paid about 50 quid for the timber, plus the best part of 2 days work for machining and assembly and if you value your time at around 100 quid a day, it makes that an expensive door. Sad that bespoke joinery is going down the tubes like so many other industries
wow, I applaud your creativity in finding a way to make the flat bit work so well!  A creative jig that worked perfectly.
@TrojanWarrior74 Cheers, and thanks for the question. It's questions that give me the chance to explain where I'm coming from. I know I take a bit different approach from many and it's not always clear in the video why I done things a particular way.
I find my tape often messes up as well. You just can't trust em :-)
@TrojanWarrior74, If I was making a lot of these panels, if I could find one with the profile and depth I wanted, if I could justify the cost then I would buy a raised panel bit.  But as none of the above applies I can get the results I'm after with the tools and equipment I've got.   The only real alternative would be a spindle moulder with custom tooling, but instead of just dreaming I can actually get on and make what I want. Spending money doesn't have to be the only option.
Awesome work! If you were near me in the US I would hire you to make my new doors for our home.
@HoundmanV, All the best for your replacement door project and It's good to hear you are getting back in to some woodworking. Making a door can sound a bit daunting but when you tackle it one step at a time, there's nothing difficult about it.  Have you seen the full details on link in the description It'll be good to hear how you get on.
@lapispinoza  , DOH... never mind the technique will come in handy if you ever want to do a "non standard" profile.
@Phishboy26 ,Thanks for commenting, but I think you missed the point. This shows how you can make raised panels without buying expensive bits and to cut profiles to your own specifications.  I try to be specific in each video, concentrating on a particular process. If you want details about initial preparation of  the timber, have a look here on the idostuff.co.uk website or click the link the video description- Cheers
@mrbudoy123  Hopefully I can put your at rest. the mouldings are 24mm (1 inch ) thick.  I don't know if you've seen the moulding video and full details on the idostuff site. . Cheers

You need to use a panel raising bit set. You didnt even show us how you prepared the surfaces of the wood with a table saw, planer, and jointer. Cheers
Thank G19,  Sorry to get you cringing. I do use a push stick when I'm pushing close towards a blade or cutter. The camera angle sometimes makes my hands look a bit close. Cheers
good instruction but i CRINGED every single time you used your bare hands to push material through either your TS or your RT... so easy to lose a few fingertips if you get a kickback...
