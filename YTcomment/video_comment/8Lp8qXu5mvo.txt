What's your ultimate dipping sauce for French fries?
100 subs complete ✅ thank you 👍
Nice
So start lunch at noon, and eat around dinner time lol...Yeah right
Can we make fries without potato or oil?
Corn starch means corn flour???
Can you tell me how I would freeze in the fridge with a long period of time
I haven't seen this lengthy and complicated method at McDonald's. 1:25
I use my Air Fryer for the second time frying so😋😋😋💙💙💙🇺🇲🦅🇲🇺🦤
Tried it. It's delicious.😊
Very nice sir ❤❤❤❤❤
What's poppin logang
Yoo
Make Sure To boil Potato?
Tried this recipe and it turned out nice. The oil should be very hot to make it crisp. Thank you for this recipe ❤
waj
You should not soak the fries to avoid removing the starch! French advice ! ;)
This is the best food around the world. French fries is the most popular recipe. It’s not a food it a magic a wonderful a lovely recipe in the land of foods. What’s your opinion?
Secret ingredient: sprinkle of cow urine
Mine turned out to be oily and not as crispy as expected 😢. I followed everything by the video according to the time given
Rock out, dude! I've tried double fry, but not your way. I'm so excited. We have them every Friday for burger night! Mine have issues that you just solved. Gracias, and I love your music choice.
Get a photo of 3 idiots film. Photoshop it and remove Farhan's pic and put your pic in its place. No one will notice it. Hahahaa

So many people in the comments are complaining about how much work this is.  But remember.... you could make a huge batch of these and freeze the entire thing.  And just fry them again when you're ready.  It doesn't have to be this much work every single time

This is a trap, fries aren’t like KFC/McD, although a ended up using a dozen of towels.
Fucking method
What’s the point of frying if u gonna take them out and put it in the oven
All those steps are so unnecessary I don’t know why people do that. I’ve always made my fries in a single cook right after cutting them. They come out just fine.

This theory is known as : Theory of french fries directly proportional to time wasting and paper towels wasting 😀
How hot is moderately hot oil? I'm new to frying and don't know what temperature to use.
Can I store it for someday?
Yummy crispy French fries, thank you from Chefs Online youtube channel.

'Moderately hot' is the an actual temperature? Celsius or Fahrenheit 🤷‍♂️🤔🤷‍♂️
I'm an 11 year old, and I will, do it
Corn starch use karne se fasting me nahi kha sakte
One things for sure. The shops don't use these method i guess cause no would want to wait an hour if you cook in this method

Good morning sir.

W video
The way he says POTATOES 😂 I love it!  Good recipe mine came out great.
the best method for me that works is I blanch my fries are about 2 to 3 minutes enrolling boiling salted water. then I drained them toss in a bowl with just salt pepper, 1 tablespoon of corn starch and  splash of a  good neutral oil. then I place my fries on a rack over a cookie sheet and bake my fries at 475F till crispy and golden.
very nice
Then the third step....... We now fry them in baby oil
उत्कृष्ट 🇳🇵

Wow 😍
Hindi bolo yr
I made it for the first time and it was tooo good  Thank u😍
Noooo
30 seconds and 45 seconds, that's super short. I followed another recipe and the way I make fries at home is to first fry them at 150c for 5 minutes. Let them cool in the refrigerator and then fry again for about 4-5 minutes at 190c. They turn out great, but I will try your way some time as well.
great
omg thank you
It looks delicious! Dear friends, thank you for sharing 😋😘
didnt work at all
Superb 😋😋
Being honest I made french fries by cutting them in slices then putting them in cold water and pouring some corns starch and all purpose flour and then just frying it in between medium and low range.. It turned out at same like his recipe
Wonderfully taught. I loved the way you explained slowly throughout the video. I will surely try your method ❤️

Kitni english bolta ha kuch samj ne nahi aaya

Wtf, this guy takes all the girls - bro give us mere mortals a chance :(
Very yummy , quick and easy to make I always enjoy this recipe in evening with the Arjun saar from PLANET AYURVEDA
I hope these french fries turn out golden and crispy... I have them cut, and soaking in cold water, but I don't have clean kitchen towel or absorbing tissues... :/
hellow ! can any one tell me that which cetogery slect in youtube cooking video?
for how long these half fried fries can be frozen
How the fuck this simple video has 21 millions view 😂😂
I tried this recipe It was amazing and too yummy 😋😋
For how long can v store it and how?
Are hindi mai bolo kuch samjh nhi aaa rha 🤣
Looks so yummy😋 Can't wait to try this!
Why people call it an easy dish when it requires alot of difficulties
Ill just buy mine
rotten eeg u took a whole millinium to make fries....
Sir i hve made this and it is very crispy
So the final result color was edited...okay
My foolproof recipe, I peel, wash and chop to desired thickness. Then fry till cooked halfway, and then dissolve a little salt in a tablespoon of water and gently pour this in the oil. It doesn't splatter, you can do this once more if you like or just a tablespoon of water if you don't eat salt. They come out crispy no matter what potatoes I use or the thickness of the chips.
great video but im going to mcdonalds!!!!!
this is gross
U explained it so clearly that it was crystal clear to me
Thank you for sharing this video
hey, as soon as you dried the fries from the cold water, add a some cornstarch and fry them right away until crispy. I cooked my fries this way and they came out incredible
Very nice to see ,my son is keep on asking,i will try
Yeah, maybe I don't need french fries today.
Delicious
"Ah mcdonalds ah send 1 large fries...ya peri peri ...thanks"

Imma make it a little more golden brown
Bhai tohar recipe to bahute badHiya ba
wow
Jokes aside, blanching the fries and freezing them takes maybe 20 - 30 mins. Once frozen you just need to heat up oil and fry them until they are done, probably about 5 mins. It's a very very easy process
My Mom When its ready : Beta Lets Frame These Potatoes 😒
It was so good and tried at home and it was so crispy and tasty thanks for the recipe 😀😀🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😎😋😋😋😋
air fryer  nhi hai kya -_- 21 mil by talling 3 potatoes  chilli kam se kam oil free to banate
Its long process!
Beta tumhari shirt bohot achi hai
Great food
Whit a minute! So you’re telling me Crispy fully cooked French fries only take a max of a minute and a half, using this method? Ludicrous
Do we need to boil the potatoes before
Delicious 😘❤️
I made these for my husband last night and he absolutely loved them...so much so that I had to make them again tonight ! Cooking with LOVE takes work and effort, so luckily for him I don't mind either 😉
Long process and not crispy at all. Waste of your time. Do not try!
Wow I have try this this is so yummy ❤️🤤
Man I got some recipes that blow people's minds I'm going to start making my own channel if something as simple as fries gets this many views I got some recipes for you! I got recipes that I have given away to food trucks that have been very successful back on the East Coast but I currently live on the West Coast where I was born Las Vegas Nevada and I am having challenges getting the simplest quality ingredients like goodbread and simple ingredients because they just don't make stuff like they do in the New England area. Example one of the best tasting cheeses to put on it any sandwich is Cooper Sharp most of the country has no idea what it even is or have even heard of it that cheese alone will have people coming back for more like they're addicted to crack and they won't understand why your food taste so much better than everyone else's.  Love YouTube!! Check this out to make these Fries over the top use Yukon Golds give them a salt bath with sea salt grab them a little bit not much at all fry those up top them off with some truffle salt maybe a little bit of Parmesan Rosemary Bada Bing! And of course use peanut oil or any other high temp oil whatever you choose.
Nice sharing
Rip me who is scared of knifes
Nice. But sir why don't you cut or remove bad part of potato... it's not good for health.-non hygienic
Towels, paper. Now I know why I don't bother with these.
What if you don’t have potato starch or corn starch? It can’t be done ?
Nice recipe I love it
India is bad
Towel waste
I just buy frozen fries. Deep fry in oil. Season to perfection. Call it a day.
Really it is complex. First fry it and then freeze it. Then again fry it. All instead I can buy it in shop !! Nice recipe.. will try it!!
You're doing it well, nice presentation..!
😋
3hrs process i am full now
How long do you leave them in cold water?
Itne steps dikha ra h pgl
take out some ready made fries from your refrigerator and fry them when u need them lol
Cornstarch ko Hindi ma Kay bolta hai
Mr chef it’s totally wrong  Learn more
Excellent ..
Are boil to kiya hi nahi 🤔
STOP STOP.  so why would you scrape and brush the potatoes if you are going to end up peeling them..   just a waste of time.  I won't even wash.  Peel, wash and cook.
Ohmygod a gay Krishna Murty
Thank you so much, i love the way u cook
Guys its Patato's not potato ok ..... 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Hindi m banaya karo
ableton or fl fries ??
Hello Chef, I have been making french fries for some time now and it turns to be decent. This time I tried your step by step method. My observation was it didn't turn out to be great . A few inputs assuming you take it in the right spirit...the two times frying method is fine which is usually followed however putting corn starch on it can spoil it. First the starch has to be mixed at the right temp of the fries , the potato for 30 mins in freezer doesn't make a difference. Infact the first batch when you fry is ok but as you do subsequent batches the the corn starch starts to  mix with the oil making it  stick to other fries which you can taste while eating. The amount of tissue paper to he used here is too much rather use a decent steel strainer n less paper. The method I have been following is to cut the potato strips n put in the refrigerator for 4-5 hours or overnight ( in water ) strain water completely before you fry and then refry for extra crispness . And if you can please incorporate amount of starch etc to be added in your future recipes it helps because quantity could too spoil a dish. I wrote this feedback because of my experience...I still love your channel and would continue to watch. 😂
Bhai baat kam chod siddhe banane suru kara kar

So first 30 seconds, then 45 seconds? That's it? 😳😳😱😱😱 no more frying? Can't believe

I came here to learn how to make crispy French fries so that I can make tomorrow in my mini kitchen 😅 Thank you for this video and all the ideas!!❤️

Just did French Frys today in oven...😎
Isse to McCain lelo.....
Amazing Fries
go to McDonald and have them right away.....
This must be a joke
But instead of double frying, I found out (after a lot of experimenting) that boiling in salt and vinegar water makes the fries taste a lot better.

Who is watching in covid-19 lockdown

I Love French Fries At Home. I Love This.
Super
I completed my engineering twice, and my fries are still not ready
It's easy
He has actually taught you the readymade French fries sold in cold storage packets. Thank you very much.
Hell No. It doesn't come out crispy with this method.
Ok this is no disrespect to the chef that made these but please skip the freezing step. It made my fries come out with a very raw-like inside, when it should have been soft and easy to bite into. Other than that the recipe was really nice :)
Ty for telling use.i try this at home I like it thank you so much
Welp...one third into video and I'm on my way out to get McDonald fries.
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰
In belgium we would say "ne goeie frit van de frituur is de beste frit"

Very good recipe good sharing 🤝
Bhaii Urdu ni aarti apko😂😂well I understand!!!
Bruh I cut the potato's and started cutting them then dried them and asked my parents to help with the oil and I was putting the potato batons in the cold water and my parents were like we won't do that and just started frying without any of the steps after the cutting I was Soo pissed bruh -_-
This is very nice 👌 and easy too excellent
I simple recipe all u need is to cut the potatoes with the peel doesn't do anything then cut the fries in mc Donald's shape and then wash them in water after that boil them for 5 mins in vinegar and water the. Let them cool then fry them at 275 degree for 7 min then fry again at 350 for 5 mins very crispy
This recipe is amazing

I should start a cooking channel to open the blind folds in our society of fake and false ways of cooking
What is that name that he's using to refer to these french fries? It sounds like "bacons" or something like that
After 4 years also its crispiness didnt change😆😆woww

Its most easiest method to get perfect cruch in minimum time. I tried it.
So, he fried them a total of 30 secs and 45 secs?
Great job🖕🖕
After all of that just to fry a potato, they don't even look done! Sorry, but I think I'll stick to my air fryer and have them done in record time!
I sweer it's tooooooo good it is so good yeh bahar sa bhi Acha hai

What is the purpose of soaking in cold and hot water and then keeping in freezer?

Hey hi sir, hope doing good. I know your channel when I was looking for neer-dosa recipe. And sir your video helped me do to perfect dosa n brought confidence. I was practicing more than a year. Used to prepare batter twice a week n ending with bakwas dosa. But after watching your video 🥰 neer-dosa coming perfectly. Thanks for satisfying my neer-dosa craving.
I just got done macking these and I sliced my finger😂
yoh, this is time consuming!
Wonderful channel, check out the anything and everything show with Simmy and bonez vlog 7 homemade dishes yummy
This isn't it
Reason for putting them in cold water ?
Nice English
Wish I knew what moderately hot oil means.
Jab english seekh ke bhi cooking krni ho to tum smjho barbaad🥴
I made it and it has very bad taste 😡😡
Ji apki recipe bhut ghtiya h hamara  to krab ho gya 😡😡😡😡🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
You are very smart 🤓
I made it for the first time and after seeing this recipe, everyone loved it. The result was amazing👍.
How to give a nice bathe to potato 🙄 potato spa 😝
Teacher: “no eating in class”  The kids at the back:
I would like to try these, they look great, but are you saying 30 seconds to blanch and 45 seconds when cooked a 2nd time from the freezer, will cook them in the middle?  That's only 1minute and 15 seconds cooking in total, surely they need more cooking time?

Pake handuk, org India pelit bgt sm tissue
This really isn’t as long as people are making it out to be, for homemade, there’s so few steps.  I thought I could trust the comments, but they just made me worried before watching the video.
You mean “Belgian fries” ?
Not me searching this beacause ik hungry
I thought we just have to boil and fry didnt have any idea of this now may be i'm not going to make😂😂
Total time calculation- Cutting-30Min Washing-More 30mins. Drying-And more 30mins. 1st frying-Extra 30sec Again drying-(you know what must be here.) Adding cornflour-15min. Freezing-30min Again frying-30mins Seasoning-30sec And-    Time taken for shopping all the items(including kitchen toilet)-100years!  Pata chala khane wala buddha ho gya
why is he looking at the potatoes like his prize possession
Great video! I've been watching a few "home made french fry" videos, and every single video has some variation of..."cold water for 30 minutes, dry, chill, wait, double fry". And every single comment section says "liek oh mah GAWD. I dunt want to cook for an HOUR bruh...so dum. I can make cereal in like 5 minutes!11".   We used your method, and they turned out fantastic!
Hindi bol
Nice ❤️
Angrez ki aulaad
I see my family been killed here, I'm offended
I have an easier recipe. Go to McDonalds or Burger king.
I’m just going to skip steps and change a few things and hope for the best.   Peel Cut Cornstarch  Put in oven  Wish me luck
This is not crispy. Fake
What I do is just peel the potatoes and wash them and fry that's it  Sprinkle them with salt and take any dip
You can't cook a potato fry in under 2 minutes of actual cooking
Thank you sir🙏
Take off the logo of your chanel!!! I dont believe in your god. Take it off now!!!!!!
All you who make jokes for likes need to spend less time trying to be comment-cool and more time actually trying what this man teaches. GOOD fries are NOT simple. Why do you think McDonald's makes BILLIONS of dollars on their fries? It's because awesome french fries take a little time and effort. If you want to chop a potato into slices and throw in a pot of hot oil, then by all means do it. But if you want REALLY GOOD fries, stop trying to be funny and follow the man's directions. You just might learn something.
Thanks
So, u don't boil those?!😶
Hindi ny malum ky Bhai
This is the perfect receipe of french fries👌👌thank u for the receipe🙏
Yes very nice French frise i make tem
How come this video gets 18 mil views but he only has 2mil subs

This is way complicated guys !!! Just cut em fry em salt em !!!!!!! But make sure after u cut and soak in water to let them dry ! If wet they will pop oil burn u and not fry good !!!!

Good Sir
How long to keep in cold water?
I tried this; and it turned out really well 😋
guys I bought atleast 100 packs of tissues I'm broke now
Too much mess for just french fries
Don't peel them. That's the best and most nutritious part.
Accha... Saare din isi kaam mei lage rahe.. aur khaaye agle din..   Kuch kaam ni bana
I am watching this video while eating french fries... Who else..
Bull shit .. .. its better who prepared on street
thank you i try this
After keeping them in cold water after how much time should we remove them??
I think I'll just go for mashed/boiled potatoes. Quicker and environment-friendly..lol
I am starving right now at 2:47 AM
What kind of bullshit is this ?
i made this with as a side with steak and salad, its one of the best fries i actually made myself
I'm i the only one how think he is so cute 😣
Mc Donald here I come !!
Interesting, why do you want older potatoes (less moisture) but then put them im cold water?
Step 85 stand on your head while the potatoes sit in the bathtub. Step 87 read the potatoes a bed time story.  Step 96 do 7 back flips, no more no less.  Step 105 take the potatoes shopping.
You laugh at his english, he laugh at your cooking

The potato starch addition is ironic, but legit.  Great fries.  Worth the effort if you've got time.
Why are there books in your kitchen
Why should we fry the potatoes twice and freeze it in between?
Thank you for your secret tips 👍
I like his accent 😂 reminds me of Russell Peters when hes mimicking Indian accent
Omg..better I just fry a frozen fries at home
Please hindi bole 😂😂😂😂😂
The fact that I watched this video only to find out we ran out off potatoes in our home 😭😭
I m hungry asf
Why do we need to fry it for the 2nd time?
I found a shortcut, go to your local favorite grocery store and buy the bagged of frozen french fries.  Its already frozen :)
Mishallah it's got to have spices on it or it's not good...needs a bit more chilli
Those aren’t golden brown potatoes and some still look raw. They need more cooking. Crispy from the outside and fluffy in the inside.
what the actual hell is this omg
2021😝

Ap to khelnay he lag gae hai Fries k sath😂

Totle aise fries nahi banti!..
You need to boil fries with a little vinegar before you fry them.
there needs to be a crunchy test for videos like this
Okay, I decided to order French fries instead of making them at home
Good show
Wow, you seem so friendly! Will watch your videos for that alone lol
Disclaimer: It will take 2 hours, easily.

Wow its heart warming to see their products previously they served us with evergreen bollywood movies and now some quantine recipes both are entertaining.
Hindhi me bolo
can i do this without peeling potato?😂
17 million sssss view omg
It's good
You are not original chef... You don't know anything about  French price ..
For making this Firstly buy a factory of tissues
Easier method works with any potatoes......make a thin corn starch paste and season it with salt, dip your chopped potatoes in that slurry and deep fry them in medium heat. They will always come out crispy😌😌
Are Uncle itni Der me to me French fries bana ke kha bhi lu jitni Der Tak aapne agrezi me aaloo ka gyaan pel dala 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

whos wacthing during quarantine tehe xd xd xd xd xd xd
Did i miss a step...he only cooks them for about 2 minutes total? The potatoes can't be done
Fry + oven + fry again? Not worth it
Do it for one hour and eat it for 5minutes

French fries: Ingredients: 5 packets of tissue paper 3 towels If you want please take one potato Etc......
"Fry the potatoes for EXACTLY 30s on a MODERATELY hot oil". Intermitten precision, I like it...
Ye baba uthale re merko nahi is fries ko uthale
Studying albert einstein theory of relativity is more easier than frying a potato 😀
I'm sure they are super yummy but ya too complicated 🤗😋🍟
Wow amazing  so nice 🥰👌nd yummy
abe sale hindi ma batata
stop saying french fries, they are belgian
Yummy😋😋
This is that most complicated french fries I've ever seen in my life 😂 Maybe if you're single you can treat yourself like this 😶
I’m currently doing these now but I didn’t have any starch so I used baking soda😂 no idea if it does the same thing
I tried it but it turned out to too cornstarchy
I decided to buy ready made.
the first part is fine but then the last part is just nonsense
What does the cold water do?
Areeeee bhai french fries banani hai Taj mahal nahi..😂😂
I like the recipe my mom thought what all I am doing wid heated snd cold water. Her reaction on eating the most crunchiest fries LOL😋😜🤣🤣🤣
Looks so crispy. Thanks for the technique.
Those white french fries 🤮
Calls for patience
Wow, kid's favourite.supper explanation
So I was looking for fresh potatoes to french fries, I found this really a perfectionist way off cooking, perhaps this is the commercial way. One thing I notice, the amount of times he fried it was only (step 1) 40 secs?  then in (step 2) 45s to 1 minute?  That was just shocking but great video anyhow. I gues the premade frozen fries we buy in stores have undergone step 1.  All in all, the freezing part etc. The steps is definitely lengthy.
Aapne itna accha sikhaya ab hum ye banaenge thank u Bombay chef
Indins love chilly powder. I'll try this
Bhai hindi bhi bol le kabhi

Would it be possible to vacuum seal and freeze the fries after the oil blanching?

Abe chalna sikha raha hai ya daudna 😂
Oh my gosh !! I made this and it was soooo sooo soo yummmy crispy and everything...I didn’t add any spices though. I like it plain. But I had to fry more than 1 minute the second time.  This is the best french fried I have ever made. 😍 I ate it with tandoori chicken and white sauce(my own recipe).

Mouth watering recipe 👍😊👌
👌👌😍😍😍
So I didn't have flour I try eat and it taste good too like mcdolads haha
Any alternative for cornstarch
After 3 disasters finally a good movie about making French fries 👌✌ Only tip I would like to add is the freezing  after the blanching in oil is not needed, just simply cool them down in the fridge is enough and you'll have an even more tasty end result but further YES...this is the way to do it...older potatoes...wash them..dry them...blanching at medium heat...cooling and fry till golden brown crisp in hot oil 👌👌👌😍😍😍 greetings from Belgium! ✌
We all are watching it in lockdown
👍😉Thank u, thank u. Now am going to cook my potato for OUR french fries. 🥔🍻👍
Super
I tried and it failed-
Finally Wasted Potatos And Oil Successfully 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
It is so funny as eskimo baking pizza.
Wah😊
1)Pill potatoes  2)cut 3)fry 4)🔥boom🔥
Agali bar Pizza banana

This man is a chakka
delicious
only thing i would do different is have a large bowl ready when it was time to season at the end so you can season and toss the fries as you do it while in the bowl in a saute pan motion in the bowl to evenly coat all of the fries before transferring to your serving plate. Great video!
Po not pa🙏

Must the potatoes be Irish potatoes
No proves to the crispiness?
We are here since we couldn't order food due to the pandemic!!
So you're cooking this for a total of 1.5 minutes? Are you kidding me? That's not even a fraction of the amount of time potato takes to cook.
The recipe was super easy and amazing i have try it 1 day ago and everyone loved it it was my 2nd time i cooked something thankyou so much 👍🤩☺☺
hari crishna forgot to season with a pound of curry and cumin.

What if you don't have corn starch
I've never seen anyone so happy while cooking
summary: 1 - peel and cut (store in cold water as you cut and peel all potatoes) 2- pat dry 3 - fry in batches.  each portion 30 seconds 4 - pat dry 5 - sprinkle with potato starch (or corn starch) for extra crispness 6 - freeze for a minimum of 30 minutes 7 - fry 45 sec to 1 minute  8 - season
wait 30 mins ??

Sir can I use wheat flour instead of corn starch....??? Please reply soon

What freezing does is it dries out the fries, hence making them more crispier
Rajesh Koothrappali is good cooking
simple way...  potatoes cut to finger size.. boiled them with little salt about half cook... put them in freezer about 10minute  above... then ready to fry them... not using any towel at all... 😁

The French fries were not in  golden brown color
This looks too good to be true
Agr cornflour na ho tho
I love french fries
Cut your potatoes into pieces. Wash them. Sprinkle some salt according to the quantity of potatoes. Fry them for 10-15 minutes untill they are golden(Slightly brown) Take the fries out and put them into a strainer and stir the fries inside for crisp.  That's a hell of French Fries.
Nice  I am  try
i will try this recipe for ramadan tomorrow, hope it turns out tasty.
I tried this recipe several times.its tasty .but never became crispy
Why in the cold water?
Too much effort for something that gets over within 5-10 mins
Good👍

Is corn starch a d corn flour is same
I have spent Rs11000 for a fridge and at last I made FRENCH fries worth Rs50😎😎😎
When he fried it for first time, I thought we are done now.
Hi there, can we just boil to replace the oil blanching step? Boil to medium cook?
You going wrong hahaha
Shit!
Can we store this for more than 30 min in a freezer
This looks amazing!  I'm totally going to try your recipe!
What about if you donbhave corn starch and potatoes starch?
hum log bhartiye h kabhi hindi bhi bol lijiye
Anyone fasting while watching this?
Shouldn't we boil the potato fries ? Or is it also ok to just boil it and freeze it ? Please reply
Nyc
Avoid chat masala , taste great with salt pepper parsley  and kisan ketchup dose the left over to add taste.
wait so you are saying all its take is 1 min frying the potatoes ???
don’t use so many paper towels use two fabric towels and wash them
No need for boiling in water, freezing etc. Just buy the right potatoes. Cyprus potatoes are the best for frying. I’ve been cooking French fries for years. Cut potatoes, soak in water, for 2-3 hours to remove starch (he adds starch lol!). Double fry. It’s easy if you use the right potatoes. If you can’t get the right potatoes, cook something else until you can.
This man looks like a lady 😂
Potato's my name is Dillip
Pta nahi but english superb mama
Or you can just put the potatoes in hot oil and wait a few minutes for them to be done. It's not rocket science people 🤷‍♂️
What about the oil????????
Abe itni mehnat kon krta hai?!?!?!
To each his own but man... that background music.  Not at all condusive .  Otherwise, thanks.

Chef: "the next step is to put these in the freezer for thirty- "  me: "nOPE!!!!!!!, MCDONALD'S GET IN THE CAR, NOW! I DON'T CARE IF IT'S QUARANTINE! GET YOUR MASK AND GLOVES!!"
I think your a Indian
Is it need to be kept in deep freze or normal??
Who's is watching it in the quarantine
Bakwas

Good
Who is watching this just bcz they are hungry, and watch food videos on YouTube like me😅
Don’t trust him, he sounds like a scammer !!
Social distance is adviced,  but still we all gather here 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂 Who is also here to learn more cooking skills during this quarantine period??
Ditch all those YouTubers saying to just boil it and fry. It doesn't work, i tried. You have to fry, freeze and refry. Otherwise it will never  become crispy.
1% Recipe 99% *Kitchen towels*
Loved this
Who is watch ing in lock down due to covid-19 ?
How long do we need to keep it in the cold water?
If we don't have corn starch and potato starch both what should we use as a substitute.  Pls reply ☺
Bhai hindi m bolne se kya hota hai
ohhh so thats where all the tissues went,, thats why the grocery shelves were empty.... ahhh now i get it!!
Hey y’all I’m going to do an experiment to see if freezing them really does make a difference !

The hunger sets in when you see all this, add a home grilled burger and boom, you got a great meal.
Nice English
Delicious and looks yummy  but there is many way to make this in simple ways
Just cut the potatoes and fry them lol
wait..  cook for 30 second, then freeze, then cook again for 45 to 60 seconds??  There is no way the french fries are going to cook thru with a 1 min 30 seconds of cooking is there?
So yummy

Hey, Can we take all purpose flour at the place of corn starch or potato stach?
Is watching this relaxing to anyone?
You know how bored you are when you're watching this from nowhere at 3 am
it is very nice and tasty
Now that I can’t go out to get food because of quarantine, I’m learning how to make French fries 😂
What's the point in washing the skin of the potatoes if you're jus going to peel the skin off?
I tried it today but this is not getting cruncy.. It is so soft😞😞 I m disappointed
🤔🤩😱😭
super
What oil should you use???
😴
What else we can add, if we do not have potato as well as corn starch
Aise towel ko oil se ganda kaun karega..😢?
Can we replace potato starch and cornflour with rice flour

Uhh can you do a buyed french fries witch is soggy and fry it
All i like in this  video is Everything
Why I'm watching this when I'm pretty sure I learnt how to make this when I was a kid.......guess its the quarantine😟

Hi. Whats the other 2 seasonings? Chili powder, salt and?
Frying 2 times not a healthy as per ayurveda
Cooking potatoes are very easy but cooking good is better than just only cooking
Yaar i came here for a easy recipe
Well ite turned out perfect..i was thinking first its nt the process but results we're amazing..Thanks
Hmm. So many process.  Maybe that's why they are called processed foods 🤔
Rifine use krna h yaa mustard oil plz tel me
Me watches the video  Try to make like him   But me  Continues chopping them and then frying them directly... Done
Quarantine got me checking all these recipes like damn, I have never cooked in my whole entire life, but somehow I want to try this.
I tried it out and surprisingly turned out amazing. My kid loves these fries better than the mcdonalds one. I think the addition of flour at the end gave it that amazing crispiness. Thanks for this recipe.
Shit, I done it before without using towels that's why it's to delicious because I used my own shirts to make it dry 🙃
It is so easy
Hindi bolne ma sharam ati ha tuje  Phir b mana vedio like ki ha

Can I freeze them for 2-3 hours before frying?
That's tasty
Whats the purpose of starch and freezing it

So you put them in water to get rid of the starch and then add potato starch later??  🤪
These things look very simple at mobile screen, but messy while doing at home. How of u agree with me???????
Bruh all you need is a pan  olive oil, and some potatoes
Tbh if it looks good I eat it
वेरी    सूपर

Amazing this method is more nice than the others

Ye kuch zyaa nahi hogya  ...mhe laga tha French fries easy hota h
Thank you
To what degree water should be cold
I tried it and it turned out to be very amazing.  Thank you so much for the recipe
that’s nice and delicious ...👌
It works really well...I have tried...tnkyuuuu
what about salt ??
The seasonings at the end though. These are _gourmet_ fries.
Why does it take so long to make fries when you can just fry them once in like 10 mins ;-;
I like the double fry and freezing. Both are the best for crispy fries, the first fry precooks and draws moisture out then freezing draws more moisture from the fry to the outside where it is evaporated off in the second fry. Here is what I use for Mcdonalds French Fries   The way I get crispy fries similar to Mcdonalds: 1) Cut them thin and soak them first in cold water for at least an hour up to 4 hours to get the starch out, ice water is best. You can tell they are good when the water runs clear when you rinse them  2)While they are soaking the last bit bring a pot of water to a boil with some white sugar and corn syrup in it  3)After they have soaked in the ice water turn OFF the boiling sugar water and transfer your fries into that for 5 minutes to pre cook and give them that extra flavour most people are missing in their home fries.  4)After 5 minutes in the shut off water take them out and pat them dry, at this point you can freeze them for later use or cook them right away. (I always do a ten pound bag of Russets all at once and freeze the leftovers for later use then make more after those run out.) 5) To COOK them you need to do 2 SEPARATE deep fries this is essential for crispy fries at home, the ones Mcdonalds gets in the store have had all of this done to them up until that point so they only need 1 cook in store 6)2 minutes in 350-375 oil (I have a little deep fryer so I leave it on 375 to try and keep the temp up) then take them out and let them cool until they are cool to the touch, it is beneficial to pat off the oil and moisture that seeps out as this point but a lot of the time I don't for the mess and to save paper towel. 7) After they have cooled back into the same temp oil for 5-7 minutes depending how thick you cut them   Some tips for the best fries:   1)Russets are best 2)Cut them thinner than you think you need to if you like them like Mcdonalds/thin, I always used to think they will be too thin but you figure it out after a few times 3)If they are not staying crispy after you cook them that is probably because your oil is too old/dirty. NEW oil is best for crispiness and USED oil adds more flavour to your fries, the BEST fries at a Mcdonalds are not right after they change the oil but they are the crispiest. The BEST fries are about 1-2 days after its been changed depending how busy it's been, they are still crispy but have more flavor.   Good luck if you try it let me know
Is there a way to freeze the potato pieces for a long time and fry them whenever required? Something like the Mccain ones?
Pls tell hw to cook this in airfryer
I came into comments to see any comment saying how will it be ,but couldn't  find any🤨🤨
Anyone notice how he says potatoes
How hot is moderately hot?
Wtf towel smh
Fuckkk itttt
My potatoes are undercooked, what did i do wrong?
Is it only oil
Can we use maida instead of corn starch
I just cut some potatos. Then chem them fuckers in the pan
“Bodayto” I love how he says potatoes
0:00-2:15 second,u have to gave a bath to your potatoes.and then use taoul.😅.
super
Ma ki yaad a gyii
I have no patience for this, once they go in the fryer they are going on a plate next to be seasoned and eaten.
No seasonings??
waiting for apu comment 😂
Thank you Inamdar for demonstrating the correct principles for making great homemade french fries.  My own previous attempts at making them were less than fantastic, which is why I wanted to learn a better way.  When I want instant fries, I'd go to McD or Burger King, but to be truthful they don't agree with me.  There is a great site, which anyone serious about making a great fry should look up--Washington potatoes, how to make a great french fry.  This is for professionals.  Your video captures all of the essentials and is more suitable to the home cook.  I apologize for some of my countrymen whose comments show them to be stupid, lazy, and rude.  I used your method and was delighted with the results. However, it will take some minor adaptations to make them the way I want, using my fryer abd potatoes. Thanks again.
This is a stupid question but how do you fry it? like add water and olive oil together?
Man i just cut potatoes and throw them in a pan fun of hot oil
Thank you sir
Bhai hindi me hi Bata deta ...
skinny legend who?
supr
Nice trip😀😀😀
Corn starch kahan se milega ??
So imma need a paper towelss like about 1M
WTF
What if we dont have the both starch?
My french fries recipe be like : Peel potato, cut potato, fry potato, done Rajshri : u dumbass
Lakh di lanat
Definitely gonna give this a try. I've tried several other methods that just didn't work out. But this looks promising
🍟🍟🍟🍟🍟
I thought he will make French fries with tomatos
"Restaurants all over the world did not get the French fries recipe consistently correct"  Says a man from India.. 😑
are you calling the potatoes "buttons"
Thokko potato
Can I freeze for a few days after the oil blanching step? So that I can make a lot of them & fry when needed? Will it stay in good condition?
He is saying pateto
I thought he said pogeto 😂😂😂
You need a better peeler and always peel away from you to avoid peeling your skin. I highly recommend the Oxo Good Grips peeler. It only takes me a few seconds to peel a potato this way.
All I learned is how to say terti manuts
I dunno wheather he is making this food in kitchen or bathroom
aloko nahana😂
Those fries are pale and look raw man, I would leave them at least 3min more on the oil til they get a bit more brown.
Chicken leg piece
Chutiyaa salaaa
Nice sir

Beggar food your way to telling get out of my site go ooo Beggar    byeeeeerrr
Oil plus water?
Wtf. From the first 4 seconds of the video I just got a great feeling from this guy. Never seen his vids before
I would rather die of starvation than do this
Koking nahi atti ha appa
Just call McD.. Matter closed.
This video is pointless without temperatures
Too much
Ich liebe Pommes

I'm so lazy to waste time
“Perfectly Golden Brown” 😂😂😂😂
I’ve never wanted to have an Indian baby before but you changed my mind. Now it’s all I want plus French fries. I’m male.
I like when he says, "Cut the potato wertically into slices."
nice thank u ..sir
fries
This looks delicious and I'm learning how to cook so this is useful
French harvest is best. Just deep fry and they come out crispy.
Can't you just blanch the fries in boiling water instead of frying them first?
wait "Fried French fries"   ... ohhh you can bake French fries??
How many calories are in this?
Very long time
Alu vaja 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Awesome
I swear you called me yesterday and told me my computer had a virus
Very easy . Lol
Superb sir,I will try once,
Ooh very easy
How dare you use my family for FRENCH FRIES
What knife is that?
Nice resapies of French 🍟 fries  thank  you for talling resapies
Cut process in half by coating the potatoes in flour  before frying. This will also cut out the fat.
That's a load of technique
If we don't have corn starch then
Microwave me banao
Nice
In still a kid like 9 years old. Till I'm 20 I'll copy how to make a food like you

I'm actually doing this right now step by step  and can't see how he cut the potatos so well..mine look dumb as hell  I just now finished, you really have to commit to this, be sure you really want fries before starthing it took me well over an hour, maybe I'm just slow
meh that's so much work, i'll just fry them lol
It's my favorite food
"percfectly golden brown" - looks pale green. Starting with old potatoes is already a fail.
It's too easy. Thanks
2019?😂
Yummy food
Looks delicious but, way too much time and work for food that is so unhealthy for us to begin with.
*Plays western music* Me:Freshofftheboat💯
Please like my comment. O yaar yaaron mein Kya kangoosi. Kar de like yaar
They look marvellous. But when I look at the chef then I hate them

Hi
Raw salt. Aah thanks a lot
My vegetable vendor gives me a small potato and says it's a big potato

You’re noob knife is pro
Amazing sir , you explained it so seem lessly.👏

What? Why do all the recipes require me to freeze the fries? I don’t have a freezer! 😭
I like your communication skills more than the recipe you told.
I hate indian people
English se Hindi karne se Achcha Lagta
Wow
Super
Thanq
This idea is totally flop!! It sucks!
achi thi recipie
Please tell me if the water needs to be chilled and for how long the potatoes need to be kept in chilled water?
what is  "patetos"😅😅
I'm waiting for you to invite me over for some French fries! Great video thank you!
I have tried all recipes of french 🍟 on Youtube this style is fast , easy and delicious better than wasting your time try this one
I'm heading to the supermarket for potatoes right now.   :)
I’ll just go to my local gas station and buy fries
I think instead of chilli powder u should have used piri piri powder
Please add subtitle or how long did you first fry . Sorry but hard to understand
I guess I have a crispy taste.
Haha same kitchen towel😂😂
For the laaaaast time it’s Belgium fries and please don’t wash the potato because you need the starch to make them crunchy 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😤😤😤😤😤😤😤and after you wash them you add starch again???🥵.  Also bake them 2 times, 1 time for a few minutes depending the type off potato at 150 celsius and let them cool completely!! Second time at about 170 celsius also for a few minutes. Please do it like this BELGIUM FRIES!!!
Men are good chef  but women are great cooks.
Took me 45 mins to peel 7 potatoes
Waste
The way he says “towel” in 1:57 lol so adorable
wow simple and easy
Too much complicated
If I'll start its business I shall contact with refrigerator company
Yummmmy
😍😍😍👍🏻
Indians put parsley in everything
I prefer my fries with the skin on, It traps the flavour of the fries and it just gives extra crisp, Anyone else feel the same??
Super 👍👍
Call me pun jabi
Cookingshooking is better
Where did you buy that lovely shirt?
Nice simple to make 👍
McDonalds was in danger when they found out bout this.
2 liters of oil and minimum 2 hours of time for a plate of french fries.  M gona go just boil it for 20 minutes and eat it.
Love The Way He Smiles❤❤❤ Thats Damn Cute
The towel is also use to wipe body after shower
Pagal hai kya French fry khane kelia 1 ghanta wait karunga kya
I wonder how many towels McDonald's  would go through if they had used this method
Using towels a bad idea and disgusting..
Thank u
Com you use corn flour
Ye to aloo bhunjia h
Is there a way to store the frozen potatoes and boil as needed?
I tried many versions for my kid. This is the easiest one and French fries turned out to be as good as McD’s.
Great video, thank you.
Hell no I'm not wasting so many trees using paper towels just dry them and then broil if you want extra crisp
I would have already eaten them the sooner you took them too the freezer or else in the end news would report me dead due to starvation..
Worst frenchfries
Saala ye toh Bihari style ka aalu ka bhujiya Bana diya re ....
alot of tissues are used
Marinate in salt pepper paprika and olive oil covered in plastic wrap in fridge for at least two hours before cooking
Just put it in the oil !
super
I came here because its 1 30 in the midnight and im so hungry and all i see is a bunch of potatoes in my fridge
Why you do this much processing when
Too much work, but looks good
I clicked on the video looking for what to do with my potatoes, but then i saw an indian and refused to watch this.    Best decision of my life
Nice

Too much work omfg 😭
After watching the video i thought that there is an app called swiggy
Use paper towels 🧻 not your dam towel from the bathroom  That’s Nasty 🤢  But then again you’re Indian so makes sense
I want to try this. I want to cook restaurant style fries at home because you can't trust the restaurants anymore. Thanks for sharing!
Is it crispy???
Eeeeeh
My mom is saying just cut potatoes and go for fry and enjoy 😁😊😁😁😊
Friends listen me this is the right way to make french fries.
Hell naw! Fell asleep half way through the video. Had to press the back button six times just to post this.
I want to eat
Mucho pedo

What is the sense of washing them properly if you're gonna scrape the skin anyway?
😆Thank you sir...your coaching is helpfull for us...
No one: Not a single soul: This guy: *Pah-teh-toe*
It's too long method...... I can cook simple,just follow:  1st step: wash potatoes and cut these in proper size.  2nd step: mix a little quantity of Arrowroot flour ( for crunch) with cut potatoes .  3rd step: you just fry cut potatoes in oil until the potatoes have light gold colour .     Now, tasty crunchy french fry ready.
I like how he says potatoe
idonno man those fries look a little underdone  4:01 but i appreciate the effort
Your a stupid fool don't make any French fries

Did anyone saw him put salt.....just want to know because I didn't saw him😐😐😐😐😯😯😢😢😂😂😀
who cares every body has there own recipe of making chips
Hello Rajshri team, I’m a loyal follower of your channel and try almost all your recipes. They all turn out extremely perfect and delish. I look no further if I find a recipe by you guys for a particular dish I intend to make. But with this guy every single recipe hasn’t turned out as promised and expected. They are all a big blunder and very disappointing. Please stop making videos with him. He has no idea what he is doing or maybe missing on saying the key points in turn which the recipe is a flop.
Didn’t come out well even after following each step perfectly
Mrathi mdhe bolaych re baba

Not correct, you need to fry these potatos at least 3 to 4 minutes each time.
Good recipe! How about using coffee spoon to add ingredients beside direct hand?

So many how to make french fries videos don't know which one to follow. Right now i am following Cookingshooking video next time i will follow yours. your recipe looks less complicated. I hope i can get same results. I have doubt about one thing, aren't you suppose to remove starch from potato by boiling it first. And with that corn flour part aren't you suppose to make a thin batter first ? Does corn flour make the fries crispy?
I Think Instead of wasting time, I would go to the Mcdonalds on the next street
Nice
Wow, I've tried it n it was so nice, thank you

I'm home alone right now and I'm craving this shit
Imagine me waiting for more than hour to eat fries
I'm hungry so that's why I'm trying to learn how to cook my fav food
Then how about take normal potato cut them half boil them then while they are boiling take out the starch from the surface of the water they are boiling in take em out let them rest so they get little bit dry then fry them in hot oil put them on the tishu then season them with salt and spices you like  you will get super crispy fries from the outside and soft from the inside .
Urdu nahi arti
nice peeler though..🙂
Bro you didn't fried it well as it supposed to be and one more thing it's doesn't required thus kind of unnecessarily
Wow thank you so much ! It came out so well
He’s indian and gay

Burger King still makes it faster and better.
Adding coriander, chilli powder and chat masala? Really??? 😳😳
For how lone can we keep the half-fried potatoes in the freezer ?!
That’s a toilet towel not kitchen towel
Woww
Simple way to make crispy chips. Boil oil at high temperature then dip potatao chips in it for 2 minutes, after that slow your oven temperature and covered them with cover. It will take 5 minutes to boil from inside. Your frnch fries are ready with crispy golden colour.

Personally i think my favorite parts of the video is when he says potato.
Superb
I'm sorry but every time he says potato I fukin laugh, bro in goin to hell for laughing lmao 😂
No, no, and no. This recipe basically relies in artificially adding an exterior layer of starch to par-fried potatoes.  This is the same way that restaurants receive frozen potatoes to conduct final preparation for their customers.  No reason to follow such a routine for a home-prepared meal.  A much simpler and healthier alternative is to gently par-boil the same potatoes for about 5 minutes (using a large hand held basket as shown in the video) and then transferring to a 375F deep fryer.  For those of your that don't know what parboiling means: gently lower your hand cut fries into a few quarts of boiling water for about 5 minutes.  This will allow the outer-most layer of the potato to convert to starch.  Very carefully remove these potatoes from the boiling water and apply to a cold ice and water bath (prepared beforehand) to arrest the cooking process.  Once the partially cooked potatoes have achieved room temperature, gently apply them to the a deep fryer of pot of hot oil.  Remove once golden brown.  Drain on rubbish newspaper adverts.  Accept accolades of friends and relatives. Credit this comment and tell Rajshri Food to absolutely and totally fuck off.
2:26 can anyone tell me if hes frying it in just water or in the oil?

There not cooked properly!
You gotta leave them in the second fry step for 2 minuets at least
Wow it's looking very tasty and you are amazing chef kip it up
You are gay!
People mention dextrose. That is used when fries are frozen so that they will easily separate. The double frying or cooking is to reduce the moisture. The less moisture you have in the fries befre they go into the oil the less the heat of the oil will drop and the fries suck up the oil. The thicker are your fries the longer it will take to brown and thus cook. You want to get the oil up to the righttemp, rop the fries into it in amounts that do not drop the temp too much, get the empt back up, let then fry then take out and de-grease. Always wait a few minutes between fring batchs to get oil temp back up..
Forget about peeling if you wash the potatoes very well such as wetting let stand a few minutes then scrip 3 times. Then towel dry the outside, cut into whatever size you want and then with a hair dryer air dry them in a willow basket so that the air can circulate and pass through. The more dry heated air you put through them the dryer they will get on the outside and of course inner moisture will rise to the exterior. I air dry them while the oil is heating. When the fries are sort of like a cloudy white on the exterior I get the thickest one to drop into the heating oil to test the hotness of the oil. When the oil is so hot that when a fry is dropped into it and comes to a float within a few minutes then you know it is hot enough to start dropping in the thickest ones so that they have the longest to cook and do not reduce the heat too much. You want the oil to be cracking not girgling because girbling is steaming them and they are just boiling instead of frying. For one serving (which is generous) I cut 2 potatoes that are about the length of the hand of the intended. And they cook up in about 10 minutes. Put a couple screens over the top to catch oily air. When you remove from thre oil I put them on a couple layers of paper toweling and place a paper towel in each hand then run them through the pile to immediately get off surface oil. Do not throw out the used paper towels as they can be used to start fireplaces or BBQ's. The potates while air drying will not turn color but do not leave them alone without air passing over them as then they will turn grey.
are u nigga or  allah agbar
That looks amazing love it
Indisch Abubabu
Those are way under done. I usually just let them fry for 10 min or so till crisp then give em a healthy bunch of malt vinegar

That's a veddy nice video my freeend.
my mom makes the best fries and it lokes cooked! and i s so good!!
When they give you unseasoned fries so you look up the seasonings
Potato starch?
the way he says potato is amazing
thanks for your recipe
bro this is indian fries🙄
Yes my fries are readt
Dude you  are fucking cooking, take off your goddamn Watch and shit, thats disgusting !!
Best fries ever are Burger King fries especially when they are super fresh
Looks great I will give a shot.
POTETOS !
It was awesome
bruh just bite the peeled potato who has time for that
It depends on the quality of the potato
Patatoh😆 that Indian accent hahaaa
Thank you. I might have an A on cooking class.
Thank u dear I made it at home after seen your vedio really very testy thank you brother
Thanks for this video ☺️
Nice recepy I tried it.
Wow! What a charismatic and helpful fellow. And wow, the food looks amazing too!
Yummy
I always wondered how to cut them up. Thanks for the video.
This recipe didn't work for me, the fries bubbled when I put them in the second time, but the cornflour fell off and burned in the oil, making it completely black.
Talk about over complicating French fries
I doesn't work at all. Thanks.
Nah takes way too long....
It is best method to do french fries
how the hell are fries cooked in less than 2 mins?
I am not a fan of fries but found this for my son. Not I feel I want to make especially after those Bombay masala :-)!!
Very interesting, I never thought of using potato starch, or corn starch..what is the reasoning? To make more crunchy? I like the video btw
9
Perfect
I will die hungry
Nyc
This guys voice is so nice tbh one of the few food channels with a not annoying voice that I actually enjoy listening to
The French fries were not at all crispy. Horrible fries 😁😁
I bilieve most of the people are here just to see the recipe,  and to be frank see it as fast as they can and leave.  An intro speech is useless and annoying for any recipe video...  So plz
Aloo bhaji is better than French fry. I don't know why any Indian will like this .
sir y corn scratch kya h
Thank you so much
Super ideal
I luv the accent
no taste i tried
Sir boil karne k liye pani ka temperature kitna barhana parega
Yummy😍🤤
Which oil is used here ???
Absolutely brilliant! I will only use this procees from this point forward. Many thanks to you, Sir!
Not going through all that work for fries just cut and fry or go kfc
Waaaaaaaoh bro really so yummy superb
Wow bro delicious😋😋

Tasty...😋😋😋😋
It's a really unique technique n after seeing your dis recipe subscribe krna to banata hi he na bro
So tasty
Your kitchen is always neat
The way he says potato is mad funny 😂😂
But I want French fries rn tho
i love it very much u have made an amazing video keep it up
Wao nice walls..
not bad man
The potato starch is brilliant
He’s very American
Looking tasty😜
These are the best fries I've ever made, thank you! 👩‍🍳
Take a shot every time he says potato 😂😂
I think thats very delicious but why a towel its a towel it might have super little cottons
But I have a confession to make, this all takes much time and people like me with a busy routine don't make food with long due. I think it will be better if you teach us a quicker way for that. Anyways the fries seemed tasty.
Finally, someone makes fries look edible
Potato strach what dose it mean?
Nice
Sir freez karne k bad fry karne se bahut Sara oil udne lagta hai  ...
For how long do you keep the potatoes in the cold water?
So tasty mmmmm

I need chaak masala
I like this recipe because I ever taste it Now I easily able to make it Thanks Varun Inamdar
What is the meaning of 4:30cycles please explain
Can the fries be frozen over night and still be crispy and fresh if I try to fry them the day after?
Dude that's half a day spent on frying a fuckin fries plate 😐 if you're inventing a nuclear bomb it would take less time than cooking fries the way you do
❓😧😧😧6
Thanks for learning me how to make French fries
4:06 it isnt even golden brown
Damn.! It looks bomb.!
It look so yummmmmyyyyyyyy😀😀

Lovely recipe

We should boil to potatos before cutting or darectly cut
McDonald’s disliked this video
Your style is good
Very bad you have not boil the potato es

Fucking long process, i ll just dump them all in oil for 10 min and that’s it
30 minutes ke liye kahan rakhne hein chips koi hindi ya urdu me bata sakta he
I think it's not the best way
You make more than better with me
What are you frying them in? And what temperature
He was pealing towards him self that’s very dangerous
Aman mere p
Can’t believe that this video has 4M views 😁 maybe because in my country people always make fresh french fries at home... nobody buy from mcdonalds. Homemade is always better, stop eating junk food..
You do not make good donuts
🍟🍟🍟🍟🍟🍟🍟
😋
Superb taste  man
dada agli baar Hindi me boliye ga
1.5x speed + subtitles
My favorite

so yummy I try
wow yummmy
Not gonna lie, this is a lot of damn work for french fires lol
i tried... but not crpy
It is necessary to fry at first time
I had a McDonald's ad play before this!
Nice nd easy
soooooooooooooo yummy
👌👌recipes
Receipes in this video was under expert supervision, dont try it at home…
I also add cornflour before frying
Those look amazing, can't wait to try them.  Love the Indian spices, too!
yummmmm
I'm assuming for the second time fry until they float on water?
Very nice
I don't eat fries but why the hell i am still watching this.
pateytoz
Very  bat
Very much time consuming ahh
Sir hindi me b bna do video..hindi me bnaoge to.. sbse jada log apki videos ko dekhenege.. bcoz bhot se naam english me pta ni hota logo ko..so
Corn floor ki jaghe kuchh dusra use kar sakte h
French fries need to be cooked 2;30 sec in the 170 degree Celcious temperature..it not cooked properly
teaches very clearly....nice👍
aapke hatho me jadoo h kya very nice recipe
It is Soo soft.. not at all crispy even after adding corn flour to it.. not at all good
I tired it and it is very tasty indeed !!! Yummy
Nice recipes so tasty
They don't look golden because the oil is clean....the more you use oil...the darker it gets..the darker the fries...when you go to MD's and your fries are very pale...thats because they changes the oil...go again later that day and your fries will be darker
Lovely
So much effort just just the potato into strips and fry in oil until they look good
where did you learn this type of receipe because it is very nice
its an amazing recipe... guys try it.. and u can even add oregano and basil for seasoning🙆‍♀️
Yum Ossum blossom
I’ll check with my wegetable wendor. I’m sure he’ll know the best.
Patatoes  hahahaha
Tava  per seco
I'm just 13 I'm really confused about the oil so tell me which oil to use
Say in Hindi not English pls
Speak in hindi for advanced sorry 😋😍😛😹😻

So basically jusy buy some frozen bags of fries and fry it
your way of explaining is good
Wow! Didn't know making french fries involved so much of work! great video, super input👌👏  That background jive music was marvelous too🎹 🎸

Brilliant
Amazing........I thought we need to directly fry the sliced potatoes.......You showed the correct method....This method makes it very crispy
Saala aaloo bhaja banaya French fries with no cheese and mint mayo Is bullshit

Where is my french fry? Bring home the french fry. Enjoy the french fry for life. All you need is to pull your french fry close to your mouth lick the chat pata first. Feel the taste. Then eat a little from one end then wait to eat some more of it. Then eat again. Repeat  till you reach the other end of your crispy fry absolute french. Don't forget to play Garry's

My hubby likes fries alot m gonna try dis very soon...for him..😍😘

C'mon let's be realistic. Who has a freezer empty like this to sit the fries in for 30 mins? You would literally have to take all your food out the freezer in order to make these fries. Too much of a hassle.
ur my favorite chef
i almost thought this was how to basic
Good 😊
so  golden brown means pale yellow :p
Taste and cool  I love it

Bhai ye kaisi shirt pahen rakha hai???
indians always put chilli powder with their black hands in every thing
corn flour ko hindi me. kya kheta hai
Means if i have to make a bucket of fries, i have to prepare it days before :P

Too long process
His cooking looks so tasty that I ignore the fact that I have a science test tomorrow
Can we store it in freezer after 30 sec fry  and adding corn flour
Its not cook well ...
After sprinkle cornstarch, can we store fries in ziplog bags?

hi I loved ur recipe... just wanted to know whether cornflour or arrowroot power can be used instead of potato starch..
where is ruchi bharani
Instead of frying them for 30 sec. I boil them with salt in water and then dry using kitchen towel and tissue paper and thn rest is same. In ths way less oil is use.
lovely recipe
