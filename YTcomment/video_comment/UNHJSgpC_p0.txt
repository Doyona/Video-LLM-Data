Thanks for the video! However, I will say that a pizza cook in Italy told us to never cook the pizza sauce
great recipe thanks
Can you do a homemade chocolate icing
Please can you tell me spices name that you used for souce in tomatos
Matt can you freeze the pizza sauce and if so how do you do it?
Second Time making this sauce, absolutely the best sauce I’ve made really good an also save some in a jar in the freezer
I don't like to give negative comments to any cooking videos but if you are blending the whole tomatoes in the blender what is the need to break them up my hand?
Extremely helpful, I am thankful for this recipe. Thank you!
Delicious!
That sauce is $135 at my local Walmart apparently. 😮
I had all of the ingredients, except for the seeds. This turned out AMAZING!!!! It paired beautifully with my homemade dough recipe. Next time, i will blend the onion in the blender to help break it down more. Definitely keeping this recipe!
Looks good. I like to add a half-teaspoon or so of red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. But, as I understand it, it's not a great idea to blend the tomatoes in a blender - the seeds getting chopped up make a bitter taste.
Would say like a 1/2 tsp of Chipotle powder play well with these ingredients, I grew up eating Italian and  I am pretty sure i could taste it in the sauce
طريقه حلوه جدا
Damn near a minute into the video and all this dude is doing is BLATHERING on about a bunch of garbage nobody cares about.  TELL ME HOW TO MAKE THE DAMNED SAUCE!
Love this❤️❤️❤️
We tried your pizza sauce it's really good
Thank you for this amazing recipe, it's simple but effective and it's just what I need! Wish the best for your channel in the future
Hi can I add dry basil instead. How much teaspoon
Matt this was great!!  Thanks so much for sharing.  I left out the sugar and it was still amazing.
Never blend your tomatoes, as you are blending the seeds which make the sauce bitter.
Thxxxx i am definitely trying this it looks good
why squeeze the tomatoes if you are using blender anyway? seems like extra step
What seeds??? Before oregano
Wow nice recipe
Yum
How do you make pizza
Hi mate I make pizzas regularly and I’m looking for a sauce but would this be ok to freeze?
No onions and way more black pepper. Sunflower kernels pressed into the dough crust. Turkey pepperoni, substitute for pork.
You sound like youde make a great DAD! Nice video, thank you.
Hello Matt.  Can you freeze them if you can't use them all?  Also, how long would it last in the fridge?  Thank you, Mr. Taylor.
Thank you, where do we keep if we have leftover  in the Fridge or Freezer?
'homemade" bro, all your sauce came out from a can. Change the title of the video to 'how to make canned sauce'
Blender 🤦
Thank you so much you are a good guy keep it up 😘
How did you dice  your onion and mince your garlic?
how long can we store it in the fridge? thank you! God bless!
Do you wash your hands?
U have very beautiful smile bro 👍  Thats really making video entertaining
use real tomoatoes!!!!! thats a scam
Pizza sauce making tutorials are all basically like: tomato sauce, RANDOM BULLSHIT GO, oregano
Super nice cool thank you very much for sharing this video ( Bangladesh)
IS YOUR HAND CLEAN!!!!
I have a nutra-bullet
You know someone is a helpful person when they have an instructables T-shirt on.
The easy way to make pizza sauce is  put 1 1/2 tbsp of oil in a pan when the oil is hot add garlic  after sauteing the garlic put tomato pura on the pan then add salt after adding salt  stair it well then cool it down  and it's done  easy and delicious
I think your “friend” was messing with you when he had you hand crush the whole tomato...as you put them in a blender.
Matt not trying to be mean but have you look at your hair line
Hey Matt respect from Newcastle England. Followed your recipe last night-wow! What a terrific sauce. Very much appreciate your time and efforts. Eddy
Thank you so much
Thank you! I'm done with my dough, and even though I haven't really been cooking for a long time, I'm really enjoying making pizzas. I usually use ketchup, but I'll make this! Thank you!
Umm...no...you're supposed to cook your sauce. lol
That's enough for 1000 pizzas.
I am definitely going to try this. Thank you for sharing!
Lovely, thank you 🙏
Tried this and it tastes amazing!!! Thank you 😁
About to make a pizza and I don’t have anymore pizza sauce thank you Matt for this great recipe 🤗😊
How many pizzas would this amount of sauce serve
could i use tomato sauce instead?
Canned tomatoes is not homemade. You need to make it from fresh tomatoes
I will try to make this sauce...
According to Master Vito the.chef.  Real Italian pizza sauce is made up of less Ingredients. Check his YouTube videos on this. But Matt has alway steered me in the right direction.. Thanks Matt
how long is the sauce good for before it spoils ????
Can i use boiled tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes?
I tried pizza  many times  without yeast . But the thing is I am not getting the same  pizza how they offer us . Crust is either being crisp nor hard . What should I do to get pizza crust with soft pongy and crisp as we eat it outside
Really it’s yummy 😋
Made this today, so yummy sauce. Thanks for the recipe🙂
What about using crushed tomatoes 🤔🤔🤔
How to use and reuse the sauce? How do you store the sauce and then use it with no hassle and keep the hygiene or not turning the sauce bad when you let it out from the storage?
I made the sauce and its 💖AMAZING💖, but how do I store it? I made WAAAAAY too much 😂
This was a great video.. I gave you a thumbs up I subscribed and I hit the Bell.. I love the way you thoroughly explain what to do thank you so much
Love to see fennel in the mix there!
What a nice guy,now i wanna be his friend lol
I just mix in some:  2 tablespoon ketchup  Salt Pepper Sugar Olive oil Oregano
Could it be used as pasta red sauce?
Hello may I ask a few questions? FYI  I'm a kid I want to make my parents some food for these though days thats the least I can do because we can't get out or I can't get out of the house and if I can't go out none of them goes out so  1.I bought  pizza sauce already but can I mix other things like sugar and junk  2.can I not use onions? 3.can I just pour the tomato sauce on the dough? Or do I have to heat it? I'm a kid so I really don't know

I was expecting organic not tinned recipe sorry not for me. thanks
So many ingredients 🙁
I don't have : -Fennel seed -Parmesan cheese -Basil leaves ---> Can i use the dried basil leaves? i have one but how many teaspoon or tablespoon it needs to create the pizza sauce?
Thank you this was very helpful
So easy to understand and direct to the point. I made it and it came out nice. Thanks ❤❤❤👍👍👍💎💎💎👑👑👑
I suppose I'm stupid but I don't see why you need whole tomatoes as well as crushed tomatoes if you are just going to put it in a blender and grind it all up.
Good job. Just to ask, what's the difference between the first and the second tomatoes.
Looks like your making a sauce for putting over pasta.  I prefer the no cook method for pizza, I agree with your opinion on the tomatoes, but I just add a little sugar, a pinch of oregano, finely grated onion, and a pinch of salt and pepper, plus a shake of garlic powder.  This sauce will cook on the pizza, once its in the oven, and the fresh taste of the sauce will come through.
Get the microphone closer to you, color grade your video a lot warmer, and the intro hello should be a lot more energetic. You're welcome.
i love adding about a tsp or so of celery seeds as well. gives a little kick to it. mmm
That recipe is more of a maranara sauce that you would use over pasta.  I perfer the no cook pizza sauce recipes, because your not overcooking the sauce.
one thing id change is cooking with extra virgin olive oil, thats a no-no
Why would you want lumpy onions in your sauce since you ground everything else.
I just made this it was delicious 😋
What type of cheese do you use for the pizza
Tastes good but tweaked added 2 tbs of tomato purée, 2 beetroots (for colour, this makes a rich red instead of orange) left out the oregano 🌿 as that normally doesn’t go in pizza sauce left out the garlic powder not needed I added more fresh garlic. Also I didn’t pre blend I cooked it all in one pot on the hob, then stick blended tasted for salting and done, good recipe though thank you 🙏🏻
You can't find fresh tomatoes in Arizona ???? There's no grocery store ?
Has anybody made this recipe? And how good is it?
Fennel seeds ??? Hey lisyen dude you just dont know ,never ever use fennel seeds or oregano in tomato sauce .Basil is the only thing to use whether fresh or dry .Fennel seeds belong only in  italian sausage not in tomato sauce .Big error.
How to make beef lasagna?
A tablespoon of garlic powder more like a whole handful of garlic powder lol Cool vid👍
You Talk to much dude
Be careful about adding Parmesan lol. I made mine a little too rich
Hi Matt!  Do you know how long I can store this in the fridge?
why do you add oil on the dough before putting the sauce on?
Is simple thanks!🌟✌💖🍕🍷
Why the sugar? Do Italian traditional recipes include sugar in their pizza sauces. I wonder if it can taste better without the sugar. Here is why a I ask. I'm Mexican and in our traditional sauces we don't use sugar but if you go to buy any Americanized version of Mexican type sauces they always include sugar. It doesn't taste bad but the flavor of a traditional sauce is way much better. I will try your recipe with and without sugar and see which taste better to me. Thanks anyway I liked your video.
Why squeeze the tomatoes if you are going to turn the blender on anyway?
Aaaaww right!
Do you have any mozzarella recipe??
Thanks so much dude!! Great video and recipe cant wait to make this and your dough recipe shout to the friend that tought you too!!!
This was awesome, thank u so much for the recipe 😋
How much tomatoes do I need for one pizza? Lol I cant make 8 pizzas in a day
For once I actually have all the ingredients for a recipe
Awesome video! And one question.. Why use the extra garlic powder? Garlic needs at least some hours / a day to really give it's flavour right?
Homemade *uses canned tomato*
1:20 what you hear in a public bathroom
this was amazing thank you.
I knew an old Italian couple that owned and managed a restaurant in Montgomery Alabama and they gave me a tip on making their family's pizza sauce... They said to try either olive paste or if you are using a food processor you can use whole pitted olives to enhance the flavor of the sauce. If you don't use much it will just add another layer of flavor to the sauce.
Thanks
Can I use organic tomatoes?
hi matt
Hey! I'm a new subscriber, this looks so yummy! I make my own pizza dough & was looking for a delicious pizza sauce recipe, I'm going to be making this today! Thank you! 🍕☺️
mmm this is not home made :/
How do I ratio this for only 2 pizzas?
Nice sauce I've heard that extravirgin olive oil should not be used for cooking but cooking olive oil is that right?
we just bought some breads for pizza from costco yesterday and put them in the freezer. this will be perfect for a pizza night at our house this summer.
I love it ! I will try this in my channel too
Hello!!  I have a wedding rehearsal coming up next Friday and I need to make 15 (12-14 in) pizzas.  How much of your recipe will I need to make and how much shredded cheese will I need to purchase? Thank you for your video and hopefully to hear a response from you as well.
Hi! I couldn't clearly hear the type of cheese you used...
mushing the tomato isnt necessary at all. I use whole peeled and I just potatoe mashe them after they have cooked a while. I also dont use fresh anything in my sauce
Am I the only one that thinks it a bit off that we are mooshing the tomatos before we throw them in the blender? Good Recipe, don't really understand the reasoning for some of the process though.
Muchisimas gracias , por dejar los ingredientes en gramos saludos desde España  👍 y  por las rrecetas
it help my dad to cook this good pizza
Always gotta ruin it with onions!
You bought those cans of tomatoes at Fry's grocery store. 👍
