Yummo. Love peanut butter and perfect in cupcake.
I’ll be using these as a starting point for an idea of mine. Peanut butter, jelly, banana, and chocolate cupcakes. We’ll see if I can figure out a good balance while still being able to taste all of the flavors.
Just made these and it was an epic fail...lol the temp listed for F was wrong and I should have doubled checked before hand. Might try again later  on maybe
Can we use all purpose regular flour?
hello! can I substitute the butter with oil?
Is this for 12 cupcakes or 24??
What's the yield of this recipe?
yummy!!!
Hi - loving all your wonderful recipes and tutorials - thank you. Making these today for a friends birthday - is it bicarbonate of soda being used or baking powder as in the comments the wording is both? Many thanks in advance for your reply 👍
I don’t have self rising flour. Can I use AP?

Hi Jemma, can i use buttermilk instead? if yes, is the ratio stay the same as whole milk?
Is this for 24 or 12 cupcakes ?
I made these for my mums birthday and she absolutely loved them and so did I ! Thank you very much
Ms. Jemma.... Do you have a link to the recipe to make your peanut butter and icing sugar topper you used for your cupcakes?
I made the peanut butter butter cream for chocolate cupcakes and it was delicious
She's really funny.

I really like it
Jemma, I tried making these PB&J cupcakes and I just wanted to say that they are absolutely amazing! You are a genius! Thank you for sharing your recipes! x
Hi Jemma,  i hate peanut butter but i baked this for my brother and he LOVES it even i did litterly the icing was my fave lol im a massive fan from New Zealand

Jemma what is the fastest way to soften butter because i was not planning to make cupcake and the butter is straight out of the fridge. What should i do now? hope to see your reply. Thank you!
Hello from the USA. I have a quick question, instead of raisin flour, can you just use regular flour?
I love all your videos! These are by far my favorite ones!
Really love how cute quirky and fun your videos are :D
Does anyone know which piping nozzle this is?!
Can you please give this recipe in cups... I'm really planning on making itt... It looks so appetizing... :) Yummyumm yumm
You are the master of recipes. P.B. + jelly cupcakes are absolutely amazing. Thank you for this awesome recipe.
Can you write the grams in cups form plz😊
Mmmm i made these and they were delicious.. And not to over powering!! They were light fluffy and tasty .. Absolutely delicious
I'm on a diet but i decided to make these thinking i definitely wont eat any and ill just give it to my family but after they were done they looked and smelled sooo good i just couldnt stop snacking on little pieces of it and now Im sooo fat😭😭😭😭
I thought Brits didn't eat peanut butter and jelly together?
Am I the only one who grabs a spoon and just eats the peanut butter from the jar... Yes. Ok😢
Hi Jemma I tried this recipe (I believe it is your plain vanilla cupcake recipe with peanut butter), however my little cakes collapsed in the middle and bulged out on the side. I also only made half the recipe? Any advice? Thanks a mil!
you funny:D x
I really want to make these but their in grams, can anyone convert them to cups. I would highly appreciate it.
I love how you say butter cream <3
Are the recipe of the sponge and the frosting for 12 or 24 cupcakes???
For the cupcake sponge, can you switch the PB for J?
I actually love you.
how many cupcakes do all of these cupcake recipes make? :)
mistake in the ingredients on the side in about 2:34, where you were placing peanut butter in the buttercream, it is written on the side "2 tbsp whole milk".
How many cupcakes does this recipe make ?
These are actually the greatest cupcakes I've ever tasted! I made these last week and everyone went crazy
Thumbs up Jemma. Just made a lactose free batch (with vanilla soy milk en soy butter) with a dash of added vanilla in batter and frosting. Even my peanut butter skiddish little gobbled it up. A keeper!
where can i find your adorable disposable piping bags?
Your weird. I like that! 😂😘💖
In stead of using spoons to fill inthe cupcakes tines why dont you use a pipping bag and squeezing it in side? its faster and cleaner :)
I am also very confused some people use a vanilla cake and some people use peanut cake what's the best to use?
Me gustó, :') Y es mejor cuando aparece las recetas una a una en la parte de arriba en una esquinita :')) (Y)
I love your vid and you description it was very fun to read
I recently made these and they were so easy to make and just sooo delicious. My new favourite cupcake recipe!
you said 2tbs of milk instead of peanut butter
Please Jemma can you make some banana and chocolat cupcakes ?
Yum yum yum
peanut butter cupcake itself is so moist  Love xx, I change every ingredients to low fat / low cal since Im controlling my weight :) But, It turns devideee anyway
Can i halve the recipe?
CupcakeJemma I made these last weekend, and they were epic, 3 fell in my mouth on Saturday! More like Faturday! Though I used a Ninja mixer thing for my peanut butter crumbs, came out too fine from one too many blitz'z, but still bloomin' tasty! I tip my hat to you!
I seriously wonder how it tastes... is it like peanut butter cookies, but cupcake form??? I need to try it!! :)
u sick
icing suger i just powdered suger
Please make more recipes i love your videos :))
Please help me~~~ How to mix the  self-raising flour?! (How much baking powder and flour...)
The frosting look so fluffy
Why your recipes always have a lot of butter? What does it use for? Thanks for your reply :)
Me encanta cuando la cantidad y productos aparecen a un costadito (Y) Me encantó !!!!
She's so weird and awkward.... but that's why I love her videos/channel
is bicarb soda baking soda?
I'd there anything I could swap out the butter for?
I want to add nutella innstrad of peanut butter
Could you make peanut butter cups cupcakes please
I made this today and it tasted so good it should be made illegal!! Absolute indulgence!
oh my, each cupcake contains at least 32g (almost 8 teaspoon) of sugar V_V, how did u not get fat?!?
Why does it say '2 Tbsp's whole milk' when you said '120g of Peanut butter'??
to mach butter
Just wanted to thank you for this great recipe! Tried it out this weekend for my friend's 21st birthday and it was a smashing hit!! For the butter cream I added just a bit more peanut butter and a dash of vanilla extract.
What is caster sugar? And is icing sugar the same thing as powdered sugar? I live in America so I think it might be different names!
Love your recipies!
CupcakeJemma Many recipes start by creaming the butter and sugar first, then adding eggs, then dry ingredients.  In some of your recipes, you put everything together at once but obviously get great results.  Do these 2 methods make a difference in the final result?  Thanks!
Wow u are amazing ;D Besides the YUMMY recipes you are super funny!!
i divided this recipe by 4 and added more peanut butter into the mixture and it is the most tasty thing i have made, thanks for this recipe!!
I made these and so many people asked where I had bought them from because they were bakery quality! Please do a christmas fruit cake ASAP. I need to get mine going and yours always seem the best recipes!
Hi jemma. Do we sift the icing sugar after we weigh or we weigh it first den we sift?
Amazing as always!
helo gemma,can i use all purpose flour instead of self raising flour?
I made these cupcakes using half of the ingredients. They were so yummy. Thanks for the recipe! 😁😁😁
My recepi book is full of cupcakes from u
Jemma what City are u in I'm in sydney Australia
I made it .its disgusting
This recipe fantastic and so easy to do! Thank you! thank you! My kidlets loved these!  I ♡ Cupcake Jemma!
How long can the cupcakes keep?
Hi Jemma, if I needed to make only 6 or 10 cupcakes then what should be the measurements?
In order to make them chocolate peanut butter cakes, could you swap the peanut butter in the buttercream to Nutella?
This cupcake is so delicious, dangerously delicious!
Jemmaa, what makes my cupcakes so dry sometimes?
Hi Jemma! Is the temperature for a fan-forced oven? Or do I have to reduce the temperature even more? (-:
Hi from Brazil! Thanks for all these delicious recipes.
if I were her, I'd be 300 pounds
Can we use regular 2% milk instead of the whole milk??
Imagine this with nutella!!!!!!!
Hi Jemma! LOVE YOUR CAKES! Just wondering: what is that utensil you use to poke a hole? I can't find it anywhere. Muchos thanks!
what a great idea!
Yes! CRUNCHY!
I don't know about this, but I quartered the ingredients, and accidentally poured in the regular amount of milk, and made another batch, this time with the correct amount, and the one with the wrong amount raised better.  ???
thanks God i found this video :D i'm wondering what to bake with peanut butter
Just bought the book yesterday, baked these cupcakes for ftour today, and JFC ! These were amazing ! So pretty and delicious. Also, can I make them with oil instead of butter ? Or will that ruin them...
Hi jemma x I want to begin my own cupcake buisness.  Do I have to add anything extra to keep them fresher for longer x thank you . You are truely an inspiration x
Gorgeous woman and a baker damn!!!!
what's the American equivalent to bicarb of soda?
CupcakeJemma I made these yesterday and they are awesome! Everyone loved them.
Just made these. They were demolished. So tasty, thank you for the recipe :D
YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM.
Diets would be so easy if cupcakes were healthy...
DIABETES
Hi jemma, instead of wholemilk can I use buttermilk instead ? As buttermilk tend to give a moist cupcake .
Oh this looks too delicious!
Impressive!!! Subscribed!!
Have you gone to pastry school? Just curious, you seem pretty pro. :)
Is the frosting she put on the cupcakes the same one she did because it looked different?.. the frosting looked white and the one she did looked brown because of the peanut butter...
i love this so much thanks jemma!!!
CupcakeJemma love this combo, your frosting looks so soft and fluffy.
I loved the video
CupcakeJemma Im from India and its a little difficult to source self rising flour here. Looked it up on Google which says its plain flour with soda bicarb and baking soda. Could you pls tell me the exact right quantities of them to be added to the flour so that I can get the self rising flour right?   P.S - You're such a cutie :D Also! Pretty Please upload a tutorial for the perfect red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. Much love! xoxo
CupcakeJemma How long do you need to process the peanut butter and icing sugar to get the 'nuggets'? I've been processing and my end product is a creamy peanut butter. Do i need to used chunky peanut butter for this?
Did any one else notice at 2:33 she put in peanut butter but it said whole milk
Haha
Pavlova please love ur videos
i made this for work, and now somebody wants to marry me. :) so awesome. pbj <3
I love your Videos... You are so fucking cool :) All the best from Germany !
It says 3 tbsp of milk when it should say peanut butter...
Ufff okay, I guess I'm going to try this. There's nothing better than peanut butter. Okay maybe peanut butter cupcakes. By the way I've tried the ultimate chocolate brownies and it was a nutty chocolate dream. Thanks for the inspiration. =) I guess I know where to go the next time I'm in the UK. I'm going to get fat and happy at Crumbs and Doilies Cupcakes. lool
Dear everyone. There is a mistake on the temperature graphic. It should say 170*C or 340*F. Sorry if you baked these at 240*F and had crumby cakes. Forgive me! Now go and bake it right! x
My fiancé made me these for my birthday! Amazing :)
OMG!!!!!!
I love your liveliness in each video! <3
Jemma! Lovely idea with delicious results.  HOWEVER I think the Celsius temperature posted said 240. I'm thinking it should be closer to 350. Remember baking is not a crumbie job.
Make pikachu or uxie sugar cookies ^_^
What piping nozzle do you use.  I keep looking at these but not sure what size to get. :)
Seriously Jemma, your cupcakes are amazing! I'm loving the peanut butter recipes, one of the best spreads ever. Keep up the delicious cupcake baking! :)
Have you ever tried Nutella cupcakes? Would it be possible to do a recipe wit Nutella, hazelnuts, and maybe some dark chocolate somewhere? Thanks in advance!
OMG IM SO MAKINT THESE FIR MY BIRTH DAY YUUUM THANKS JAMMA 💕⭐️☝️
looks delicious
How many cupcakes does it make??
I love eating massive cupcakes like this, but if you cut the bottom of it off and stick it on the top it stops the icing from going up your nose!
Что это было?
Love Jemma's videos so much!
What's the song that's playing ??? :O
What mixer is it
I must make this cupcakes! Love your videos :)
Looks absolutely amazing! Would definitely try it out when i have the time. :)

Thank you for properly scraping the sides of the bowl before reincorporating the ingredients in the mixer. I like things done properly! :)
This would be my perfect cake if it were vegan friendly
Mmmm, don't know which is better peanut butter and jelly cupcakes or Jemma...
Jemma, you are AMAZING and I just LOVE your videos!! 😄 I have to try and make these! Looking forward to your next invention 😉

She was trying not to laugh cause it sounded so dirty.

Wow these look great!! But would the cupcakes get soggy with the jam inside? Or how long till they get soggy? Anybody? Thanks!
I 💖 Jemma!!!
Are these your own recipes? Btw i love your videos x
Must... resist... innuendo... Screw it! If you keep trying, you'll be able to fit it all in! I've noticed you've done a lot of videos with nuts, trying to tell us something? Are you saying you're used to white stuff in your face? I'M SORRY, MY MIND'S IN WEIRD PLACES TODAY Great video!
Wow mmmmmmmmmiam!
When you put the pb in for the icing, the dingy ingredient thingy said milk..#editingprobs
Does Jemma has a boyfriend? lol :D
Please don't get rid of the ding sound - I love it!!!
Yum! ^_^
i just saw you on food junkies and i went to try that cheese cake :) i love it xxxx   great videos xxx
wonderful, can you make some chocolate cupcake without coffee?
When you say the amount of peanut butter for the icing a measurement for milk comes up.
please remove or lower the anoying ding sound when the amount and ingredient appears!
that looks sooo delicious!  I'm the crunchy type, too ;)
wow, yummy! My son is a huge fan of PB&J so I will have to make it for him... I don't mind it either lol! Thank you so much!
