Thanks for sharing 💐. Where did you purchase the plastic wrap?
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Yours is the first recipe I've seen that makes thin tortillas. The others make 4 tortillas with 1 cup of flaxmeal! I will follow your directions to finally suceed.
can you try flaxseed & spinach together?

I bought a press at Target this morning for $13. It was marked $20 in the stoe but I got it for the online price. The recipe I followed didn't call for oil in the dough but next time I'll try it. You seemed to have less trouble separating the plastic from the tortilla. Thanks.
Who has such a press? No one that I know!
Question, can I make these without oil?
I gave you a thumbs up but stating at 1:39 that the flax meal is almost zero calories is just wrong, 1 cup of flax meal has 897 calories or almost 90 calories per tortilla... good recipe ...
The recipe easy and simple , good jop thanks a lot
Wonderful episode ... New subbie from Eugene, Oregon 😺.
This looks great, I have ground flax, can I use olive oil instead?
now i have to buy tortilla presser
Today that mexican store is called Amazon
I am certainly no expert; I’m here to learn. However,  I do know this. All dough made with flour,that contains gluten, must rest before cooking. That is so the gluten can develop. There is no gluten in this flour. Are you certain this flour needs to rest or maybe it is just a habit ? No offense to anyone. I am just wanting to be able to cook immediately and not wait 2-3 hours if really not necessary. Thank you to anyone who knows the answer.
How do you grind flax seeds?
Very nice recipe.. I'm on a keto diet, so this is great for me.. my question is, do these keep for a while in the fridge, or do you have to eat them the same day?
These have an awful texture, they're kind of slimy.
I already Made Thema. They are so delicious 😊 thanks 💕
You boil how much oil and what type of oil did you use?
superb , usually i made it but i don't put any oil except on a pan i took little bit of olive oil bcoz didn't get stuck
Does it taste good  too just after blending it?
Where did you get your tortilla presser?
1 cup Flaxseed flour (meal) 2 Tblspn oil Seasonings 1 tspn salt 1/2 cup water Let set for a couple hours Press small balls in Tortilla press. fry up.
poor sound can't catch so many words
You sound Jamaican. Are you?
These look delicious!!  I am definitely going to try these.  Thanks for sharing your great info with all of us, helping us to be healthier!!❤️
Hey - question! Can you freeze these? It´s just me, I don´t have a family or anything to feed, so I would make a bunch and freeze them if possible..
Maria, is your larger press also by Victoria?
respectful hint: stop using non~stick pans!!  They are EXTREMELY toxic!  Cast iron is my choice <3
10 balls..wow..!
Looks easy enough ....will certainly try them
What size is the biggest tortilla press
Yum ... gracias ... can I use olive or coconut oil instead?
Can I ask what you used the oil for as I havnt seen oil in other recipsy
Hello, nice and easy recipe worthy to try ,but do u use hot water or cold water, and thanks in advanced
looks yum!
Thanks so much.
Mine became crumbly it wouldnt stay together. How did it stick together?
Can i use olive oil or melted butter instead of the oil you used with this recipe? Thanks
I'm Pakistani. I think it's quite cool that Mexicans have flat bread, just like us! I gave you a thumbs up. Thanks for sharing your recipe!
How do I get rid of the slimy taste texture of the flaxseed. I’ve tried several recipes with flaxseed mill and I just can’t get rid of the slime texture in my mouth. Help
They look good  n round.
I'm sorry did you say annatto ? If so please be aware there is a science fact between that flower and people whom have Asperger's or autism. I just wanted to clarify because I thought that's what you might have said. Yes I replayed the video. So please if you have loved ones with those conditions please look up the condition.
👍I’m gonna try it 🤞 Thanks for showing how it’s done. 💞
This looks really great!  Two questions please, is it mandatory for the recipe to work to use this annato oil... or is it just for flavor? I mean, can I just use olive oil?  Also, does it really wrap? I've tried several types of flat bread recipes using flaxseed, and they always just break up when you try to wrap something in them.  Thank you.
Delicious!
Hi what was the name of the oil please that you used? And how do you ground up the flaxseeds?
AMAZON SELLS ALL KINDS OF TORTILLA PRESSES
I JUST ROLL THEM WITH A ROLLING PIN, ALSO USE  ORGANIC BROWN FLAX SEED. GROUND IN THE COFFEE GRINDER)..i USE 1 TSP OF  TOASTED SESAME OIL IN THE OIL AMOUNT (YUM!) AND I USE ORGANIC COCONUT OIL. (USE THE EXPELLER-PRESSED REFINED OIL IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE TASTE OF THE RAW UNREFINED OIL)
I think ill try addeding just a couple spoons of corn masa to make mine.  I have had a Bunch of flax seed for a while now and im glad to know how to cut carbs and use these up too.  Chia seeds should work also  as they GEL UP the same way. i have alot of those too
Tortilla presser?  I want it

I call it bread as I am gf so anything making wraps or sandwich = my bread🤗
Lovely bread!
