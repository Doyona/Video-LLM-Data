Finally real make up
Doubt you will ever see this comment considering the age of the video..  but What top is that?!?! It looks awesome O.o Does anyone know what that is or how to find it?
Here in 2021 lol- oh my god tiny Ripples!
I’m going to match my eyeshadow to my underwear.   I love this look SO SO MUCH!!!!  I would LOVE LOVE to see more of this type of videos here in 2020 😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😘Would be easy to do in quarantine I would think.   I love your edgy beauty looks

I wanna know what primer she used
Awe I miss chase
Lol the damn green glitter mentioned again. It's like a scavenger hunt!🤘
Finally I can relate to beauty gurus with my cakes ass face. I thought it was just me but no.
You have the same eye color as I do.
I love on how like says ‘oargne’ nor orange but oargne
Baby Ripley😍😍😍
GREEN IS BEST COLOUR
Watching this in 2019... quakeing at the sight of mikey using glitter
I love the wig. Is that one from your brand?
Omg I never realized how small Ripley was in this video!!
This colors in this could work for her “my horoscope picks my makeup” video she uploaded recently
AAAAH IM WATCHING THIS IN 2018 RIPLEY WAS SO SMALLLLLLLL😱😱😱😝😝😝
1:44    I have spotted a green glitter in the inner corner.............
I miss Chase
Can someone tell me what video has the green glitter incident in it???!!!
I just tried my 1st smokey eye...it was no where near what yours looked like....
Now I gotta match it to my underwear
Ooooo I think I might use this eye look with gold for my birthday next week!
OMG RIPLEY AS A PUPPY😍😍😍😍
MAKE YOURSELF INTO HENRY!!!
"Who's Babs?" Made me laugh too hard. Babs is what i call my nieces because i have too many.
What happened to chasee
Omg!!!!! Baby Ripley!!!!!! What a cutie!!!
glam glore keeping it real with the form of which you apply your makeup mad voice over skills better than nicki
CAN someone explain... what ever happened to her bf?
WHERES CHASE GUYSSSSS
Is that the Tokyo ghoul jacket from  ur kaneki look??
I want to see her do a mister crabs look but in a zombie form
Why not green? Do you have beef with green glitter?
Ripley was so teeny such small pupper XD she comparatively so big now
Really love how close up you got. It really helps for us unprofessionals to do our own makeup!
i actually thinks im more pale then you! ahahahha, i only use one highlighter, and that one highlighter only shows up with a dampen beauty blender soooooo.. dont know what its called, hahaha…
I am laughing so hard! Riley pooped! I am like that with my cat, she a little bit eccentric. I do love my Kiki so much! Thank you very much, I would like to see a little bit more colors: blue, soft brown, green ect. 💝🖤💖💜💋
Do an all liquid lipstick makeup look
So happy I found your channel
I think I really want to use this look for my senior prom... But gold since I'll be gold that day 👍
That black is wayyyyyy to dark for your eyebrows
Beautiful as always
Newbs probably over there like "WHAT IS WITH THE GREEN GLITTER?!"  Hehehe
That moment when you watch Mykies' latest video and realize how much you missed her glam videos, so to fix that I go on a glam tutorial binge XD
“Dark on both sides light in the middle”.  Do you mean a halo eye
you should do a mirrorless spfx challenge (idek)
Hi. What kind of dog is that?
"use anything close to your skin color" the only thing close to your skin is WHITE my friend
No one would use green glitter after the incident
Da green tho.
Ehh cakey
Is....is that a sombra jacket? Or am i hallucinating?
mikie i seen at least 4 little glitters on ur face with in 30 seconds and iT wasnt  the glitter you put on ur eyes iT was alReady there
How often do you clean your brushes? I feel like I never clear mine enough
Love your glam videos! ❤️ do you have any tips for blending for people with hooded eyes??
I need glitter
Looking forward to some Xmas glitter eye tutorials x
And I look amazing in green so 😜 lol
oooh i love this and i have these colors
I bet you do recommend avoiding green 😂😂😂
YOU SHOULD DO D.C. LEGENDS BLACK CANARY! W/ w/o the mask.
Can you use lash glue if you don't have glitter glue? They seem similar. Also! What's y'alls favorite cheap black eyeshadow? I need one
I wish I looked like you
I actually just found a speck of green glitter on my leg. I don’t even own green glitter. Mykie we have to talk.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!!!
I have watched this a hundred times but I never noticed WHERE DO I GET THAT JACKET
Rotf. I was thinking black and green. All dreams went right out the window unless i guess I'm crazy, which I'm NOT or am I??....  Loved this tutorial. Your personality is amazing.  The lipstick color is lovely!!!
Do a Kato inspired look!
This is my favourite look of yours (Glam style) and the smokey rose gold look. 😍
My best friend and I have turned the intro into our favorite inside joke
Do glam and gore supergirl!
I added you on YouNow
Okay. So I get to the end of the video where she says '... burning to see' as I'm scrolling through her uploads and scroll passed her burnt belle video. Sorcery.
Are they still together?
i wanna know how to look like a potato   wait i already do
you should do an until dawn makeup tutorial
Her beef with green glitter brings me such joy.
What was THAT HIGHLIGHTER BRUSH FROM!!!!!😍
I know this is old but i love you mykie
I'm Babs :D  Love this tutorial :)))
I don't think I've ever applied liquid lipstick and it not get on my teeth! What's up with that?!!! Love love love this look! The eyes are stunning! xx
Whenever I try a smokey eye or in general use a black shadow on the outer corners of the eye, it looks like a black eye. How do I avoid that?
Hey there just wanted to say I've become a new zombae and I love your channel and ideas so much would love to try some of them out ^.^
Kaneki Ken's jacket anyone? Serious Tokyo Ghoul vibes.
I tried this look and failed
I wish I could play and use makeup like you, Mykie, but I breakout so much with any kind. I always have a nude/naked face but when I get bored I "attempt" to practice some of your looks and styles. I normally end up messing up and going for a halloween look. :/
So beautiful I love glam and gore 👄👄
reminded me a bit of a postman butterfly before you put the glitter on. ❤
omg the green glitter joke😂
I really want her jacket thing...
This is my favorite glam video EVA!!!!
Love this omg
I would love to see a full fx look again. PLEASE
Anybody notice green glitter at the 4:00 mark
Babs Seed from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Am I the only brony here? Haha

💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶
I did a similar look with blue and not black... just all blue =D But yours looks much more beautiful and fantastic <3

Loooove it!!
HOT MAMA
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
What glitter does she refer to in all her videos ? ( ya know , the herpes )
I love your wig in this video <33
i love all of your videos !! my sister said u remind her of me! makes me feel pretty :)
I just love how the "Green" continued on. XD You're amazing!
Me crying because I've been cursed with small eyes! Can I take yours please Mykie ❤❤
My cousin calls my dad 'Uncle Babs" 😝✌🏻
The evil green glitter that is the herpes for your video
omg! It'd be so cool if you did a video like a two faced video! Like an angel on one side and a devil on the other! Or like a girly girl on one side and a grunge hip girl on the other! <3 Ily!
could you do the pink eyeshadow/eyeliner picture on your instagram please?!
For anyone who reads this; I've been desperately searching for an eyeshadow tutorial like this one but I cannot seem to find it. I thought Mykie made that tutorial but with green instead of copper. The rest is exactly the same. I remember watching that video over a year ago. Either Mykie or Laura Leth uploaded it but I could as well be confused. Does this sound familiar to anyone?
"Like blue or greeeen, if u wanted green glitter on ur face, for some reason, and ur crazy..." Lmao xD
That coral is AMAZING with your eye colour. 😍
I love your channel! You are my absolute favorite! What palate do you use for vibrant colored eye shadows??
Can u do a legend of zelda look like a dark zelda eye look x
I love your videos mann
If she has a fivehead then I have a sixhead 😐😂😭
You explain things amazingly! I did it and I have everything you have it ended up perfect!
Ur just plan old fun girl. I wanna b yo pal 😁
I know I have asked before but I cant find my comment anywhere...  What's a good eye liner to use on the lower water line? EVERY single one I've tried just wears right off in a VERY short time from blinking.
Did anyone else notice that spec of glitter at 1:30???
Why avoid green glitter? Genuinely curious 😂
Can do a video on how you do your foundation and highlights
Yes this is a very late comment but this is my favorite You-Tuber she's super inspirational! I always look forward to unique and unheard of Glam and Gore creativity!
you are sooooo beautiful
i saw glitter on the inner corner of her eye at 1:53
this wig kinda makes me think of the bride of chucky for some reason
Love this eye look so cool
definitely using this look!
i love your videos <3 not only do i like you make up looks, i also love listening to you... you seem to be so full of life and happy and loving :) keep going!
why, specifically no green glitter?
When you were putting in blush you kind of looked like Elsa from Frozen.  What kind of dog is that? It's so cute 😍
It's really cool how when I first started watching Mykie, I was just learning makeup and looks like these seemed insanely complicated to me, but now when I re-watch her older videos I'm like, "Oh, that's easy. I can do that."
THAT'S A NICE PUPPER!!!!
I love watching your super bold kinda crazy looks bc I'll never be brace enough or have enough skills to recreate it on myself. Love you Mykie 💗💗💗💗
i think you are amazing ! and i love all of your makeup 😍
What kind of dog is ripley?
Lol she really like picking on green
FARest
What song was in the background?
This look is great for Fall time or a Rock Concert!!!
i want mykie to be my best friend
What is the problem with green glitter?
I used Violet as my pop color and it was amazing
What do you have against green glitter?
i wish you did videos more often ! i love watching your tutorials
Spent and hour doing this perfectly, opened my eyes, hooded eyelids. FUUUUUUUUUUUU..
I think u should do a everyday make up video

I'm doing this look in a dark red for my high school leavers dinner :)
my nickname is babs haha

she looks so fucking hot oml
Neeed that wig! <3
You should do a verity of ways to do eyeliner.

What was that highlight you used?
You should do tutorials as Tim burton characters. As a series like your Disney princesses!!
I think your eyebrows better last year, honey, you got lowkey sperm brows
I ship it
Very beautiful
Where did you get your jacket omf???
her eyebrow bothered me the whole video
OMG THESE PEOPLE ARE AGGRAVATING ME OMG. YALL ARE GETTING KANEKI VIBES BECAUSE SHES LEGIT WEARING A KANEKI JACKET. SHE LITERALLY FACEPAINTED A KANEKI ON HER. ITS HIS JACKET. nerds
I've always wanted to see you do your own twist on Tim Burton characters! A series like your disney princesses!!
I absolutely loved it!  I have to try it but i doubt it'd turn as awesome as yours
I really have been wanting to start wearing eyeshadow...then I see this and know I can never do things like this 😢😭😭😭

This is a great look for falll.........I think I'll wear a more toned down version of it tomorrow
Advice to haters, just tag her instagram account in copious amounts of green glitter xD
I feel like the highlight added on your inner corner would've looked even more stunning in a gold tone, however amazing makeup tutorial as always. 💕💕
What is the story with the green glitter
Awww my boyfriend calls me babs hahahaha
#peachsatan
Gotta admit I was totally scared when she just went crazy with the black liner but then it got better and I chastised myself for doubting the Mykie
at 1:40 you can spot a goddamn green glitter on Mykies left eye🙄
Love this!
Your wig is gorgeous I wanna scream I live in Canada :(
Love this!!! Is that regular glitter??? and what kind of dog is that??? so cute!!!
Your videos NEVER cease to make me smile x
Great look. Love the lips
DID ANYONE ELSE PEEP THAT GREEN GLITTER SPEC???????????????
You look so beautiful........

Mykie, you are so goregeous!!!!!!! 😍
You are by far my biggest makeup inspiration and you are so beautiful and cute at the same time and I envy how you can pull of practically ANYTHING. I am a huge fan of yours. I was wondering if you could maybe do a Nux/Warboy from Mad Max inspired look but for girls. Like a WarGirl makeup look to show what girls in Mad Max on immortan Joes team would look like? Thanks so much
i am shocked from how GORGEOUS you are girl, your personality is gold too, keep doin what youre doing, youre gonna make it real big one day hunny<3

Please .YOU MUST TELL ME ! What is the highlighter ??
I LOVE UR AND CHASE'S VOICES!!!!!!!!! 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍
7:25 Fun fact, Mykie: After you apply any lipstick, stick your finger in your mouth and drag it out-- it'll keep lipstick from getting on your teeth. This might be kind of difficult to do with liquid lipstick, but it's soooo useful.
Lmao i can't stop watching the start, you and Chase are relationship GOALS <3
I want to hear the story behind the green glitter!
You've done really creepy mermaids in the past but you should do more mermaid themes. ;v; <3
For some reason this whole look reminded me of... like... the girl "normal" female version of Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul... does anyone agree?
bebis means baby in swedish! 😊
I swear I die everytime I see that dog
you look like sabrina carpenter to me idk why
I love you so much mykie!! 💕
I actually love that you still did this video with the foundation looking dry/cakes because it makes me feel a little better about when this sometimes happens to me

I wish she would do a look for blue hair/brown eyes. it's so hard to find a look that matches both colors. I'm even having a hard time with neutrals.
Im not sure u understand how much i love you
My initials are BAB which is basically Babs :o haba
+Violet Hall just because people wear lots of makeup it doesn't mean they are trying 2 hide something. Usually they are wearing it because they find it fun and they like it. Also makeup is her job and she is really lucky 2 get a job doing something that she loves 🤗
Would you mind telling me what are the best ISO and Aperture settings for when you are just using the ring light? Thank you so much! You're personality is BRILLIANT.
mykiiiie!!! you're so amazing, i love you and your make up master pieces 😍
Not the green glitter ,who ever uses it is a mad man and should watch more of her videos to understand why
i love her eyes! are those her natural ones?
This is such a cool look! Thanks for teaching mykie! :D
Do a princess jasmine mauled by her pet Raja
it would be cool if you did a voldemort tutorial. I'm going as voldemort for halloween and i have a vague idea of how i'm going to create the look but i have no experience with sfx and stuff so it would be great if you could do a tutorial
will snazaroo face glitter be suitable?
my friends nickname is babs
Queen of like everything omg
you should make a video about the basics of sfx. rules of certain products, techniques, and basic products you use .

I love this look😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
3:26 is hilarious. The herpes of makeup!

Hi! I would like to say that as a young, person your videos really inspire me to use makeup as a form of self expression, and maybe even get serious about sfx and make somewhat of a career out of it if I'm good. Also even if I don't always have easy access to some of the products I see you using in your videos (liquid latex etc) I still find watching them extremely entertaining. So umm... Thank you for being so cool and inspiring)
Omg, Mykie is so perfect😍😍

Do a makeup tutorial that looks like the devil from panic! At the disco (emperors new clothing)
Love this look, its simple but still really make a bold statement, which is what I adore seeing. But, what I'd really like to see, is a way to take something dark, like horns or stitches, something like that and have  them glamorized into a very high fashion, kind of Vogue-esque look. I think it'd take someone with your talent to really make that work <3
I want that wig !!! 😍😍😍
I have asked every one with a makup channel to do a black and red look, or at least incorporate red somewhere in the eye area. i need some inspiration, and who better to ask than you! please please please.

Mykie, I love all of your work, mostly because you're not a vapid YouTuber who always says, "Hi guys!" and stares into a mirror narcissistically while fluffing your hair....  But I need a recommendation on foundation. I'm a porcelain princess (feel free to use that term, mah dear) and I can't find a foundation that is light enough that provides even coverage while not becoming the centrepiece of someone's wedding...  Can you lend some help peeze??   Heart you, lady bug. Thanks.

It's to the point where I have to scrub my skin red raw daily and moisturise daily. Anyone have any ideas? I don't mind moisturising daily but scrubbing my face hurts like a b*tch!

i love how you give this tiny tipps everyone is wondering. because other people cut often out the hours of blending and readding color which is the big secret behind most of the eye makeups.  i also love that  this video just a way how this kind of look is working out and don't use special limited whatsoever products  <3 just some extra love from me to you!  often some of my friends or random women in the gym ask me how i am doing my eye makeups and then they are suprised that i mostly use drugstore products and a random collection of pencils.

The green glitter hates you :v
I enjoy your fx makeup tutorials
My eye shadow matches my underwear...because I'm not wearing eye shadow.
Mykie should legit do a tutorial dedicated to the green glitter. Maybe get a little avant garde-y and cover your face in it. Remember, what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger...or ya know, stays with you for 7 years. 💀✨💚
Hey Mykie, did anyone ever tell you that you can pick up glitter really well with a sticky lint roller?  Just for future use.
Mykie you should totally do a Pride Prejudice and Zombies Glam and Gore due to all the hype with the movie coming out:) For glam do like a vintage lady makeup look and then gore it up with some zombae action.  Love ya and keep up the fantastic work!

Do a tutorial on making you look like Ripley. Lol. Idk.
i know you already did a revenant look but.....I really want to know how to get lips like his in the movie, when they are all chapped bleeding and crusty looking lol. Gross maybe, but I am curious!
A deer/doe makeup? And for gore a zombie one or one that's been hit? 😅 Idk just add some blood or something :3

Could you do a spin on beauty and the beast? Like belle has been bit by the beast and now shes turning into some sort of ....werebeast?
**in a weird Russian accent cuz turtles** Mykie you should totally do a severed head gore thingy and some how make it glam-afied
DOG

Hi Mykie! I love your channel and have been following for almost two years now.

For your next look could you do Fran bow? I think it would be really cool with your skills! （＾ｖ＾）
Yasssss MYkie ! I loves it ❤️❤️❤️ you're amazing xoxo
heyy could you maybe try the twin alfa from teen wolf?
I'd, personally, love to see you do both glam and gore things on guys in your videos? I know you're the focus, but I'd love to see you create things on male faces. As far as ideas go, I think something that would be AWESOME is to do a "Universal Monsters" makeup series, but with your personal touch. I'd love to see you do Dracula, the Wolfman, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, Frankenstein's Monster, The Phantom of the Opera. That would be legit.
DO TØP BLURRYFACE MAKEUP PLEASEEEE
can you become Ripley? that would be epic!
Love love love this.  Please never stop making videos or I may cry. Also if you decide to stop, you'd better have a show. Why don't you have a show now?!
Have you ever thought of doing a glam vamp or werewolf in transition look? I'd be suppppaaarr interested in that if so :)
I'd be super jazzed to see a Freddy Krueger tutorial

Omg I love this look so much !! I have to try it !! Thanks for another awesome tutorial 💗💗
An 80's look would be amazing. Kinda like the 90's glam and grunge look you did but more like.... glam rock and Molly Ringwald... It doesn't rhyme, but wasn't the 80's all about rebellion?
beautifulllll😍❤️
AMERICAN HORROR STORRRRYYYYYY
Mykie, I don't think I ever left a comment on your channel before but I just wanted to say how much I enjoy watching your videos. It's not only the make up (a big part of it is though, you inspire me so much) but also just you. I love you as a person. You're so fun to watch and so pretty, you make me smile every time I watch something you uploaded. I could tell you what I would like to see in your next videos but I'm happy with anything as long as I can see your pretty face. I'm sorry this came out pretty long but it's hard to express myself over text.   Xxx  Your forever faithful Zombae, Emily
Imagine mykie transforming herself into ripley

The other neon zombaes !
You should do twisty the clown with and without the mask from American horror story Freakshow, or from ahs coven when cordelia stabs her eye out, or from ahs murderhouse the burnt family (larry's family), or even Sally's bed monster thing from ahs hotel or the addiction demon. Basically I think what I'm trying to say is an ahs series would be fabulous x
I'd love to see a Cupid/Valentine's day  inspired look!!  (And that totally can be made part gore, of course)
Where do you get your wigs! They are perfect! I'm wanting a grey one like that one but idk where to start lol
Girl your skin looks like mine lately.. my skin is thirsty!
Can you do a tutorial on a person who has just went through a zombie apocalypse? Like they got beat up and bitten and they just look very post-apocalyptic? I think that would look really cool. Or it could be a glam person so she had some sassy makeup on before the apocalypse and the zombies just messed her up. Love your videos!!💙🔪

Fun story: yesterday, I was at my band rehearsal for our concert and I had my binder on the stand and I took it off to put it on the floor and behind my binder was a single spec of, you guessed it GREEN GLITTER. I literally FREAKED out! the same thing happened a couple weeks back in science when one spec of green glitter was on my table. I tried to take a picture but it didn't focus and it was the middle of class. just some proof that green glitter is cursed and NEVER leaves.
green glitter #neverforget
Can you please do a basic smokey eye tutorial
Loveee these colors :D
it would be awesome if you could do a half and half or superhero special fx look (maybe a zombie batman or a zombae beast or omg a zombie Professor X)
