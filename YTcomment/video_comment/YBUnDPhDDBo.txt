Tea Tree Oil, has been a life saver for me. After I returned home from over 600 hours in the Hospital (from Covid) My scalp, ears, neck and inside of my ears itched terribly and so I treated them with straight Tea-Tree Oil and it stopped the problem cold, but I had to treat it every day for a while. I acquired lots of fungus on my toes-nails and the Tea-Tree-Oil completely eradicated it! Ang my acquired gray hair (from Covid)  turned dark again! And the Tea Tree Oil stopped the skin cancer growth!
I use a few drops of tea tree oil along with my toothpaste everytime I brush my teeth. It has helped to get rid of my periodontal disease.
Drinking game: drink when the narrator says "Tea Tree Oil" Cheers!

Can you use tea tree oil on dogs warts
Thank you for sharing this helpful video👏👏👏
I’m using tea tree for an antiviral (just got over a winter cold) but I will try the two cup water/ 2teaspoon tea tree for cleaning.   Had no idea it is used for cleaning mold either, until watching this. I can’t afford YL Thieves cleaners or pre- made natural cleaners.  I can make own though. I love the scents of various essential oils which is a bonus.
I mixed it with my shampoo and my itchy scalp stopped itching in a matter of minutes.
it goes to show that we have remedies and cures just from the environment  but pharma keeps this knowledge away from us  because they want us to consistently be sick and not fully get cured  for their own self gain of making money out of the sick its a really fucked up world we live in
I love tea tree oil in all those uses described but its already an oil and makes my hair very oily.  I dont mix it wirh any more so called carrier oils. I have never had any burns or reactions. Just a little antiseptic tiny sting that feels refreshing.But, beware you need to wash it out after you treat ailments. because it feels greasy. Use with caution and own risk. But, for me, I love the astringent tingly feeling.
Does it also help with fordyce bumps?
It works well when my penis head is red and itchy. 2-3 days alternating with coconut oil and it's gone.
Could this help with fight a throat infection you feel coming ? I was told to gargle warm water with drops of tea tree and it will kill whatever bacteria
i make home made deodorant with tea tree oil in it . Also use it for nail / foot fungus dry scalp and hair growth
A written list would be much more effective.  My brain turns off with so many spoken comments all at once.
Was recommended by my local eye hospital as I had a viral infection. It worked very well. Only use it after a proper diagnosis though.  Just 2 drops per cup of boiled water.
I’m sorry, what kind of oil is this video about? 😅

Can I use tea tree oil with my daily face cream
I didnt believe in this teat tree oil BS... Then i used some on my cuticle infection.  Cleared the infection faster than the antibiotics I got last time. like..... in 3 days I was totally healed.  I did add coconut, EEVO, and Oregano oil to the mix on day 2.  But, I feel like those were a bit of overkill.  Went back to Tea tree oil only on day 3 due to skin irritation when applying.

Bought tea tree oil and the smell reminds me of pine sol (the cleaning product), is that normal?
Tea tree oil is my very favorite oil because it truly works for all of these remedies mentioned. I’ve even killed carpenter ants with it. The brands I’ve used is DoTerra essential oil or Sundown  pharmaceutical grade 100% pure Australian oil. I use this oil in some form everyday.  It is the best. I hope you find this oil as helpful for you as I did. You will never stop using it. To your health.
Yes! So helpful!!! Thank you
Has anyone else questioned just how "natural" essential oils are? Sure they are derived from a natural source like everything else, but they have been processed into mega concentrates nature never provided. What is natural about that?
I've used a little mixed in with coconut oil for treatment on coldsores. It dries them up almost instantly and reduces heal time. Also it soothes that lame discomfort coldsores cause
