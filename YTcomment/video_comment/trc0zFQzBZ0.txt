AMAZING!!!! THANK YOUU!!
DUDE thanks a million! I was able to hang my Guinea Pig picture frame on the wall without a Stub finder! thank you!
Thx trying to hang a swinging chair in my child’s room and stud finder was being weird. Gonna try this.
😢it doesn't work for me 😭
👍😊👊
That .... works perfectly, thx!
Fabulous idea, using a magnet for finding where a WOODEN ceiling joist is. You didn't vote Trump by any chance?
It would have been nice if you could show it on the ceiling that has heavy not popcorn but textured swirls. But the magnet idea sounds great! I have purchased super heavy duty round ones to help hold my christmas wreath on the door except unfortnately the lead glass door was not magnetizable LOL.
All your DIY info should have fit in 60 seconds!
Great tip TY
You can purchase a magnet for this purpose. It's called a "Stud Buddy", but I have found rare earth magnets to be just as effective.
teeth
No math, no brains….sweet bro!! 😁
Got to mount a tv bracket in the morning for my niece, have bought some magnets so hoping this trick serves me well, I feel much more optimistic now 👍
9 years later this video still helped me. appreciate it
Brilliant!!!!
Great video very appreciated
Oh because I have a magnet just lying about
Handy tips, but you didn’t really address the woman’s question about finding ceiling joists.
a screw head can easily be over 1/2" off center of the stud, and as you move over further and further you can get an effect that's called "tolerance stack" effect, making you WAY off-base. If you have sensitive ears and hands, you can tape the wall with a mallet and hear/feel where the stud is. This CAN be done with a steel hammer, but it's high risk for damaging the wall's facing.
Brilliant. Worked perfectly. Thank you.
What if there is no light which or wall plug?
I grew up in a digital world so i purchased a stud finder. The magnet won't help my digital overanalyzing brain 😅
What if your house is OLD old & has plaster & laith walls… No drywall.
Video starts: “Use a magnet.” Demonstrates briefly. Video ends. 10 second video.
Honestly all my questions got answered I literally was just going to hang something in my bathroom to help my shampoos and all that stuff and every information you gave me was great thank you very much I'm very new at handy dandy stuff I am a woman so I am learning how to grip a heavy-duty tools so thanks 😊 your video helped me very much
I have a stipple ceiling and couldn't get a reliable reading but measurements and the finder got me close enough to use strong magnets. Thankyou for the reminder about magnets.
BRILLIANT!!! I'm so glad this video popped up on my feed!!!Thank you for the tip.
Thatnks for the input i will tey it out
Super glue 2 magnets on a string also works.
brilliant, so helpful, thank you!!!!
Great video, I will use this in the near future!
Brilliant!
Great advice and simple enough that anyone can understand and do it.  P.S.  Fix that gap between your front teeth.
I simply knock on the wall until I hear the difference in the sound produced.
I was screaming Get to The POINT He loves his voice I had to take a zanx, going insane with my son. Me disabled senior who is Helpless.I just NEW u WERE CRAZY CRAZY. I just NEW it would not work as I had dozens of holes in my cieling. But my Child tried with the magnet at first he came saying it wont work. He  suddenly said Dad DAD look the magnet stayed and Walla we had the Bean. From Crazy man U became my HERO MY HERO KISSY KISSY to YOU. AMEN. P.S;  YO.U ARE FANTASTIC.
My tv mount I bought in 2015 came with a magnet and instructions for doing this to find a stud to install it.
just curious, what in the stud is attracting the magnet and holding it in place? I thought stud was just plain wood ..
This is how the old stud finders used to work before we got the electronic finders. Anyone that has been doing this for a while knows this; nothing new here. SMH. Maybe you can ask Al Gore how to patent your invention.😂
Awesome man! Worked better than any other method I've seen.
Bravo my friend.  I used neo-dymium (rare earth) magnets when designing latching systems for sheet metal enclosures. The strength of these is incredible relative to size.
Dude! I'm hanging a 46" TV today. Thank you so much. Brilliant with the magnets!
They actually sell this product at Home Depot.  It's a stud finder for metal studs. It also uses a magnet and it's very inexpensive, like $10. For wood though nothing really beats a good electronic stud finder.
Excellent.
This worked! I had given up on hanging a plant from my ceiling. The hook kept sliding right out of the drywall. Using a magnet, I found wood . . . and success!!! Thank you!
1:53 to 1:58. for those who actually value their time  and want to skip  all bs nonsense story telling talk...  You're welcome
You’re taking to long to explain. A lot of unnecessary information. Fast forward two times fast and it’s still too slow to do the information.
I better not see a single fkn complaint in the comments bc as a single woman with TWO “stud finders”, yet hasn’t been able to find a stud for the past TWO decades…this is a God sent video!! Thank you DIY dork!!!!
Will this work on lathe and plaster wall that are about 1/2” plaster?
Guess you never heard of a magnetic stud finder or MagnaPull products that came out around 2003.....
Summary: use a really strong magnet to find screws attached to the stud
Will this earth magnet work with plaster walls to find the studs?
Brilliant!!!!
I've been using this for years, and it has never failed me. 😊
I don't think this will work in my plaster ceiling or walls... But I'll give it a shot. I have a tough time on my walls with a stud finder. Ceiling? It just don't seem to work at all
Someone should invent a device that can tell you where the studs are, with like a "beep" or a light or something...
What about brick houses?
Wow I needed this before I bought the stud finder… With 7holes later and a couple of hrs of frustration the tv is up on the wall… Thank you great info I will use it next time!!😊
They have stud finders with magnets and levels that are better than a stick….  Also, electric stud finders are pretty damn good.  lol at this video
Me needed a no brainer method 😂😂
Hello Mr Diy Dork, like you showed in the video, if you find two points on the ceiling, how do  you know these 2 points are on the same stud or on 2 studs? Thanks,
You are a legend. My dad never taught me this, so I'm just going to assume he doesn't know about this either. I was able to find the joist in my cieling using one of my vacation fridge magnets ❤ Thank you so so much!
talks too much
I'm going to give this a try before I buy a $200 stud finder. My old standby deep stud/metal stud finder doesn't work on roof joists in a modular (mobile) home. I already misplaced my simple magnet stud finder on this job!
Thanks so much
What if my magnets stick to the whole ceiling and not just a specific area? What does that mean?
Joist is in the floor, rafters are in the sealing.
Very cool idea!
Awesome!!!! So clever, thank you❣️
❤ unfortunately, I have plaster walls😮. A regular stud finder will Not find the nail. I used a rectangular magnet and EVENTUALLY found where the stuff was. Thank you so much for your video.
That's a great idea
Damn get to the point. Too much chatter
Finally!  A much easier method to find a stud in a wall!  Thanks for the tip!
Bless you!
I have a hard time separating these small magnets stuck to each other. Any ideas ?
Very informative and educational!
cant understand what mum r saying
I think you have invented the dowsing rod for stud finding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing ! 😀
Can I just add.....if you have cats, consider not leaving the magnets stuck to the wall but rather mark the spot immediately with a pencil.  Magnets seem to look remarkably like bugs or some other item that should be investigated and destroyed with extreme prejudice and they will go to extreme lengths to capture them.  At least, that was my experience. :)
Oh yeeeaaaaaah.  Thanks from sunny Harrogate UK. :-)
Thank you for this.
Does look a amazing idea. Not tried yet. As a DIY’er not a guy “on the tools” how would you know if it’s not a pipe? Or (be Frank) is that a stupid question! As in no pipe in bedroom wall etc???   The idea looks brilliant. Would you need a decent magnet too. 🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽
Great idea. Machine gunning nail holes is bad.
Nice. Thank you for taking the time to explain it.
great video. I'm looking to attach something to my ceiling studs and this information was very helpful.
It’s Also good to find the edges of the stud with a battery stud finder so that you know exactly where the middle is then the next bed thing to do is pre drill before screwing in any leg bolts to insure not splitting the wall studs or ceiling joists   I install overhead storage racks and practice these procedures   Great idea with the magnet 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍
OMG THANK YOU! Best tip I’ve seen in a very longtime! I tried it and it totally works. I used the magnet off the back of my work name tag. Thanks again
Great tips. Thank you!
Wow. This was so incredibly easy and much more accurate than any stud finder I’ve used. Thank you so much!
If you are currently reading this, no matter who you are or what you have done in your life, please be saved today, there's no more time to waste, time to waste is up and done! It's the best decision you'll make in your entire eternity; accepting CHRIST JESUS as your LORD AND SAVIOUR KING GOD MESSIAH and EVERYTHING! This is the Gospel; The LORD KING JESUS CHRIST loves you so so much that He came down from Heaven, lived the perfect life that we cannot live by ourselves, He died on a cross at Calvary for you, me, and ALL of us and ALL of our sins, and He rose again from the grave 3 days afterwards, conquering death, hell, sin, the devil, all evil, and condemnation. He's waiting for you to accept Him and come to Him with open arms in a genuine personal relationship and there's no other love ever like His since He loves you eternally and infinitely so believe in the LORD GOD KING JESUS CHRIST YESHUA HAMASHIACH, receive His HOLY SPIRIT that will dwell in you, change you, lead you, guide you, and be your absolute best friend as GOD the HOLY SPIRIT just alongside CHRIST JESUS the Son Of GOD, GOD incarnate, also finally GOD the FATHER, which those 3 together make the HOLY TRINITY the one and only true GOD. I love you but nowhere near as much as GOD. Repent by believing in the LORD GOD KING JESUS CHRIST and thou shalt be saved, and once you tell JESUS that you believe in Him and genuinely trust in Him by inviting Him into your heart, you are sealed unto the Day of Redemption and you cannot lose your salvation in CHRIST JESUS and He will help you live for Him with His HOLY SPIRIT Amen, the Rapture is the Day of Redemption also which is so extremely very soon and He does not want you or anybody to be left behind nor me nor you do. GOD bless you and KING JESUS CHRIST IS LORD GOD. ✝️👑🦁🕍💒🙌🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️‍🔥💞💯💖  John 3:16 (KJV) - 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 14:6 (KJV) - 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Romans 10:9-10 (KJV) - 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) - 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.  1 Timothy 2:5 (KJV) - 5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;  Revelation 1:7-8 (KJV) - 7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. 8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
I bought 2 differwnt stud finders. Lol I have a 3 car garage and hunging a 10ft strut rail to hung punching bags rings and a rope on my 8ft ceiling.  I think I found joist. They running parallel to garage doors and are 24" apart, however after finding center of each joist they are 1" wide🙄 I tought they were at least 2" wide??  Iam using 3" 3/8 bolts.. My house was built in 2005
Thanks! Great video👍👍😊😊
What about finding the 😊wood stud ?
4 min video for maybe 90sec of info get to the point then give extra info and wouldve been nice to get a visual example for finding the ceiling stud instead of going from exposed screws on a wall to a regular wall all in all dissatisfied
4:44 long video  "Use a magnet"
Magnets.
Wonderful!  Thanks for explaining it perfectly and demonstrating it as well.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👎👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️❤️
This is good if you are putting one nail or screw, but if you have 3 screws like on a handrail braket that has to be really strong then  you Have to know where the edges of those studs are...with that you need to use something that will show you where the side edges are...but this is good for some things for sure.
It just works. Thanks!
good video, wish you showed it on the ceiling
Doesn't work well for popcorn ceilings plus his was supposed to be for finding ceiling joists and all that was discussed was walls.
Magnet + popcorn ceiling is not working. Think I'll just take a small pin and keep poking until I hit the truss.
I have a wall in a new house where the studs are NOT 16” on center
Excellent! Ty
Game changer. Thank you!
speaker magnets are the best
I am really impressed. Thank you so much for your trick. It is really useful.
Thanks
Brilliant thanks
PLEASE HELP: ANYTHING HELPS. I will be installing some melamine cabinets soon and the wall has plywood behind it. My cabinet backing is 3/4 I would assume the sheetrock is 1/2 and plywood 3/4 or maybe half? ANY IDEA on what screws I should use for extra strength any tips help thank you! I usually use 3” screws when I install these sort of cabinets but just the thought of the plywood behind it makes me worried. I know where the studs are behind the sheetrock and plywood but still. I was just thinking of putting Atleast 4 in each section and legs for extra strength TIA!! Anything helps thanks guys!!
I like your Y-twig magnet. It remindes me of an old style water dowsing stick. I'd never thought of trying this. Great idea though.
Enjoyed your video.  Thank you for sharing.  If I were installing a bathroom fan, would I cut and hang the fan in between the place where studs were found?  Thank you in advance.
Wood studs??
Amazing, didn't know this was easy to find with your methods. You don't even need an expensive stud finder with this. You're video is really helpful!
Thanks, great tip, simple, easy, and worry free,
How would I find studs on my outside walls?  I have stucco exterior walls on my house and I need to locate the studs so I can mount a heavy hose winder on the side of the house.  Any ideas?
How about finding a stud behind a tiled plaster wall?
I never even heard or thought to do this! Thank you good idea
Thank you! Very helpful. 😍
I tip my hat to you, Sir. Brilliant! :)
Great video
I have a drawer with tons of these rare earth magnets. Some how I'll have to convince them to let go of another
Get to the POINT pls
This is the best method. It works 100% for me. Thanks to make this video for people.
But does it work on the older homes that have plaster? About 80% of the homes I work on are plaster. Thank you
What if the magnet is sticking to a power coil?  You’re putting people in danger with this advice
👍
👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾
I believe this magnets are banned in the USA because kids can swallow them. We used to play with them at work ad yes they are super strong.
This does not work for my ceiling unfortunately.  :(  I have a very powerful magnet and it works on the walls, but not the ceiling at all.
Yeah don’t just bang a nail or drill into your ceiling.. you don’t know where the wires and pipes are running.
What about older homes
Using a rare earth magnet to find the screw heads … great, simple idea.
AWESOME!!!
Throwing my stud finder in the garbage and using your method plus a chalk line to mark out long lines.
Firstly- love your NON-CONDESCENDING presentation. It is straight forward, easy to follow- reference to your use of the method is pragmatically ACME.  It was your (this)video saved me from further evasive stud "meltdowns"  (adult temper tantrum).Considerable time since video post- Not sure if my comment will be received- can't hurt to reach out- so...probably too detailed, but for this I seek your expertise:  I have a Bosch stud finder - studs, metal, and electrical.   Find it quite accurate effective. However- I am Catifying a bedroom in my home (built in late 50's). All has gone well with 2 exceptions. It is these exceptions for which i seek your expertise: #1-  in the exterior wall, something (in sheet rock perhaps layers of old paint ((lead?)) impedes the stud finder AND strong magnets, however finder will pick up electrical. The studs also vary from 15"- 20" little congruence.  I have used an outlet for reference, then drilled sm holes every ~3/4" .... 35 holes later...(my drywall finish work sucks.) Aside from going outside house to search for nail heads in the siding (not reliable either) what would you suggest? #2 Drilling into ceiling (to secure studs, posts, sink hooks and screw eyes) is abnormally labor intensive (again stud finding massive pain in arse) mostly, it is so difficult to get a bit through what ever (impervious sheet rock) with which it was constructed that i literally hold the butt of the drill atop my head, and use legs to get it into stud (overkill no?) thoughts, ideas? oops! spaced. i have another conundrum: #3 **should have stated the cat room is only half of the room** Naively attempting a budget, i used extra materials from my outdoor fence as temp wall mid-room or "room divider".  i have installed 2   6' ( floor to ceiling) PVC fence posts  secured in studs at ceiling with 6" steel  L brackets which hold floor to ceiling( lightweight) hinged door, 1/2 sized PVC planks cap ends in studs) PVC panels between. top half wall cheap PVC decorative tiles (paper light) connected with PVC tape and to 1"x3" x 11' wall to wall at ceiling.  Without creating threshold (i'm clumsy -tripping imminent )what can i do to secure the posts at floor so door will continue to function?  dissertation end.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND EXPERTISE. HOPE YOU AND THOSE FOR WHICH YOU CARE WERE SPARED FROM (all that was AND will continue to be) PAIN AND LOSS OF COVID-19 segue: (SCIENCE  = FACT. PERIOD)>>>VACCINATION SAVES lives=GET VACCINATED  (unless you have a penchant for Russian Roulette ((not so popular these days))- HELP UKRAINE!!!                                                                                       Dogs are the best thing to ever happen to Mankind.                                                                                                                                                            -D.A,Fouts  .
Cool easy …I’m gonna try it thanks
It doesn't seem like my ceiling studs have screws that point to where my magnet is :/ i've been trying all over my room
Thanks man gonna try this on the ceiling hope I don’t drop a magnet on my face lol.. appreciate the video👍
Great tip!
You could also buy a “stud buddy” from Home Depot, haven’t seen them at Lowes , but the stud buddy works amazing and already has the magnet built in and is ready to go…I think I payed  $6. Best stud finder I have ever used and it’s not even close
It doesn't work for crooked studs 😅
Great idea, but I've had a magnet stud finder for quite some time. I paid $10 I think, but mine is strong and has a place for a pencil and is also a level. Well worth the 10 bucko's. Used it last week in someone's basement. Solid, works every time!
......too much talking to get to the point.
If he hadn't explained why he had a y-shaped stick on a magnet, I would have thought he was trying for it to look like a water dowsing rod.
And you hope whoever put those nails in hit the center of the stud, and also the studs not bowed. I've seen some badly bowed studs used in building.
You also better hope that when the drywall was screwed in that the person doing it hit the center of the stud and did screw it on close to the edge. When you do your pilot hole that might be fine near the edge, but if your putting in a lag bolt for a tv mount, the bolt could kick left or right bc its not really going into the stud. I'll usually use the stud finder and then double check with the magnet just to see how close the two marks are.
Thank you so much for this
I am a contractor. I have a small magnet epoxied to a  piece of dental floss about 2 feet long. Have the magnet and Floss wrapped around a old Match book so I can keep it in my wallet. So just wave the magnet on the string around the wall and it will just snap to the nearest screw. Works fast. Also works good a retrieving tools dropped in areas too hard to reach. Can't tell how many cordless screw driver bits I have recovered after dropping them on a deck and the bits rolled threw the crack.
Awesome!!!!
Great Ideal
so, a stud finder with stronger magnet, because capitalist company try to save a penny and sell you stud magnet that are just sensible enough to be useful, but weaker...
Thank you. Do you know if that would work through carpet? (floor joists)
Back in the day 1960’s or so, my father purchased a small clear plastic box with a magnet suspended inside on a pivot.  Slide this box against the wall and when it located a nail head, it would point to the nail head.  Available at most hardware stores.
Doesnt work well on lathe and plaster, only drywall
This trick works great on smooth surfaces!   BUT ON A POPCORN'ED CEILING, NOT SO MUCH.  NOT AT ALL ACTUALLY :/
I used this method to install grab rails in my shower.  I had to use two of these magnets stacked to hold to the wall through 1/4" of tile.  But it worked!    Fortunately, I took several samples on a single stud.  Knowing that I don't always hit the stud with all of the screws, I made sure that I didn't find the one outlier that never did contact the stud.  Perfect-amundo!
I put a rare earth magnet on a piece of masking tape, fold over the tape to make a "tail". To use, pinch the tail between your thumb and forefinger and use your thumb to guide the magnet as you rub across the wall.
Thank you for sharing , I will make a couple of those.
Wow what a smart idea, thanks very much.👍
Yea... I honestly can't believe most of us never thought of this... it's actually quite clever. This is also a useful validation method to validate a stud finder. Since stud finders could actually be finding something else behind the wall this can help you validate you actually found a stud (e.g. some stud finders will find metal conduit behind the wall and you could use this to check if you have a long length of metal conduit or a stud). Pretty neat for sure!
were's the ceiling part? omg
Thank you
The top nail in baseboard is in the stud . Look close it may be puddied over but its there you'll find it . If your putting in cabinets pound a 8p finish nail in where it will be covered .
Great trick.. Too bad I already spent $12 on a stud finder!
So how do you find the studs in an old house with plaster over metal lathe?
What if there is no electric light socket from which to measure?
Smart guy You are! I've been doing construction work most of my life and never seen this trick! This just solved my problem with finding the studs in my wall project. I use to do it with the method of measuring off a wall switch or outlet but this is better cause it locates the stud directly. Thanks for sharing. Joe
Brilliant, dude!
Omg! Thanks so much!! I want to put up a shelf in my laundry room and I don’t know crap about studs, lol I will use this method, great video!!
I'm 70 and been doing DIY for over 50 years and this just about beats every other method I have seen! It is also the cheapest! so you get not one but 2 thumbs up for this! 👍👍👌😆
That is an awesome fricking idea!  Thanks!
Great idea but some of us older guys probably remember that stud finders existing before the 70's used a magnet with an indicator that swung as you passed over a screw.  So it's actually not a new idea but a very old idea rehashed.  Of course the magnets today are much stronger so the method works better.
Fantastic tip! I'll definitely use this. Studs have always been my kryptonite for DIY because I never trust the little 'studfinder' tool. They seem inconsistent to me. The magnet will work great and it's a way to error-test too. Thanks much!  Update: I just confirmed this. I had a super strong stick magnet, like the kind you'd hang tools from. Placed it on my workbench (I'm looking to install new pegboard on studs). Doesn't stand up unless there's a stud there. Of course the cabinet installers found all the studs already and yep, those locations have a strong attraction to the metal screw in the wall. It's nice to actually feel the stud because the stud finder is so awkward and temperamental.
Works great  !
ya i think they use these rare earth magnets for dovetail guides. these little guys will grab a saw like they're stealing it from you.
thats great until you get into older house where they laid a 2x4 against another one for ceilings and your line is 1.5 inches on either side, but still findable, nice
Oh my goodness!!! Best tip ever 😊  I found a bag of super strong magnets at a thrift shop for $3 and I can find every nail in the studs and leave each magnet there until I'm done 😃 I can't thank you enough!!!  And now I have good use for all those magnets 😄 (getting the magnets apart is another story... 😬)
Wow! Just WOW! Forget all the rest. One stud finder after the other. Maybe, kinda, sorta? No more. Rare earth magnet. (pulled mine out of an old computer). Bam! Done. Move on. Save time and money. Hate to admit this after 50 years of rehabbing homes, I was wasting waaaaayyyyy too  much time and money. Thank you great wise man.
Always like a no brain method,for I'm qualified.👍
Very well done sir 👍
This method is useless if you have paneling instead of drywall? How to find a stud without drywall?
Excellent tip... my old stud-finder isn't working right... happened to have rare-earth magnets... worked great.
How can you find the joists in the ceiling when there is strapping for the drywall?
Magnetic stud finders have been around for many years.     Joe
Does this work on popcorn ceilings?
What music is that? Sounds vintage.
Saying nothing
Brilliant thank you so much👍
Variable results on late and plaster. As with all stud finders
Great hack, thanks for sharing!
One problem:  You are detecting the screw, not the joist.  You can approximate it with fingertip tapping and you can drive thin nails through your drywall to be sure.  But what we need is a device that detects the actual wood joist, not metal screws.
Okay, does this work with Ceiling Heating? I Have an older house when ceiling heating was a thing lol, and want to find a ceiling joist. Will the magnet stick to the cables/heating wire (whatever they use) ?
90 seconds in and this history lesson bored me to the point of making a comment.Just give us the method please
Like it.
Thank you
Won't stick to uk studs cos they're made of wood, try again!
Have you seen this man in your dreams?
It's called stud finder magnet
Buy a big magnet in Home Depot or Lowe's comes with a handle for $10
Another easy way is to bash your forehead on the wall & you will be able to tell where the stud is.
Amazing trick!
Answer starts at 01:55.
What if I used wooden screws?
Finding screws not studs
No math and no brains, that’s the perfect method for me 😂😂😂😂
I took the cover off the outlet but how do I know which side the stud is on??? I can't see inside the wall.
Would this also work on floor studs?
thanks for the help. finding a stud on the ceiling is really HARD but if I adapt this method with A long stick things will be EASY.
Hey bro, very nice but did you know they've been selling magnetic stud finders for ages?
Don’t fall for this advertisement.  It’s a fake.  You fill out the form and you’ll get every low life insurance and their brother calling you to sell you a Medicare plan.  There’s no free money like 5hey offer.
Genius!  Watched all three of your stud finder videos!  I feel empowered and saved money--thanks!
rather that buy a magnet - if you have an old bad hard drive laying around take it apart and harvest the magnet out of it.  not quite as spot on as a little circular magnet but, it does the job nicely.
Thank you for the fantastic idea, no stud finder was working properly in my apartment but this trick worked!
Love the magnet trick! Brilliant. 😊
New knowledge to me...THANKS!!!
X-ray vision will do in a pinch.
Magnets 🤤
I agree with you Roc
I have a magnet in my tool box for just that reason. It's got a 50lb hold weight, so it snaps right to anything ferrous in the wall
Or you can grab a huge branch and bang the d/w off the wall and... TA DA  THERE ARE ALL OF THE STUDS.
Okay so I'm a dork, I've never seen or heard about this trick.  I don't own nor want to purchase a stud finder so this is perfect for me!  Thank you 😊
You could actually drive a bus 🚌 through the gap in his front teeth 🦷
At first I say to myself what is he going to show me that I can't already possibly know and then I was like hey that's a pretty good idea what a great trick I learned something after 30 something years in the business
Great tip!! Thank you!
I use a Walabot.
Thx for sharing.
You can buy a stud finder that made from magnets
I put my magnet on a string. Swing it back and forth against the wall while  moving it up the wall.
It worked straight away :) Thanks dude
Dunno how I came upon this video but now I’m grabbing a magnet.   I’ll be dammed. Who says you don’t learn something new everyday.  Works as easy as shown.  Well done
You have hands down won the award for the most simple and best piece of DIY advice I have had ever... This solved my problem immediately !!
Lol They Sale Magnetic Stud Finder!
An experienced tradesman uses state of the art 'echo location' by thumping the sheet-rock using their knuckle, like sounding a watermelon for ripeness. It's actually quite easy to do.
Good on ya mate!
Ok so if I do that on my popcorn ceiling will it work too? I need to hang a projector and screen ! Thank you!!
Thanks for the idea
I love you!❤️
Good idea! They also make a magnetic stud finding tool for 10 bucks.
wonderful!!
Thank you<3
Hahaha! Dad was mad he forgot the stud finder. but i had youtube and a magnet!! Thanks man.
What if the screw was not a screw, but rather a plumbing or electrical line?  😅
An older guy at a hardware store nearby told me a very similar trick, but I think I like your method a bit more!
boring presentation
I always carry a magnetic in my wallet, to find a stud and magnetic pans from thrift stores.
Wow, this is genius, I've been over boarding for year's and nobody I know has ever done this. I will give it a try today.
My father in law taught me to use a flashlight - hold it against the wall pointing up (or down) and slowly move it along the wall with the light beam going up or down.  You will see where the screws are almost immediately.  Works every time.
Won't work on lattice and plaster
good info
I just want to celebrate another day of using rare earth magnets
Brilliant! Thanks! I’ve been trying to be definitive about ceiling joists before I hang something heavy. Great help!
Pal....you spent more time telling me about things I don't need to know...just get on with the technique.
Talk to much get to the point I left
old stud finders had magnets. this is nothing new.
Skip to about 3:40 for the actual trick. Up to that point he is just fertilizing the air .
Thank you man!
D
he is smart !!!!
they work great on wood
30 seconds of information in 4 1/2 minutes. I want my 4 minutes refunded.
You Sir are awesome! Thank you!
Good idea.
great idea, thanks for posting!
Been there, done that
I bought a $12 battery stud finder from Home Depot. Works like a charm.
Shahdu wajah mamat ni...........
ful jacket wal xddd hello
guy sounds like he is on speed.
This is very useful thank you for making this video
Great idea, thank you!
In this old house there are meshwire ( old stuco house) The magnet is on every cm.
Super cool! :)
Brilliant
Lol just use stud finder
Suggestion:  Minimize the talk and maximize the important points and visuals.
I think you broke your little stick thing when it fell
Great idea. Thanks for sharing.
Run for president, you have my vote.  Thank you.
Nice. Was jus thinkin of doin this. Ty
Awesome video! This was new to me. 💪🏼👍🏼😊
So what if it’s wooden joist. Because u can’t screw a ceiling fan into the metal joist
I enjoyed the video and found it very informative. However the sound is bad sounds like you're in a bathroom or someplace with slight Echo.
They've been selling magnetic stud finders for years where u been
I wish people would get to the point from the get go
Wow, Just what i needed to KNOW!!!😀.  Thanks sooooo much!!!🙏🙏🙏
Omg that’s awesome and so easy! I bought two grab bars for my aging mom and haven’t installed them. Was afraid I would not hit studs properly and would feel absolutely horrible if I installed wrong and she grabbed and it pulled out of the wall and hurt herself. Now thanks to you I can install with confidence and know my mother will be safe! Thank you so very much! I’m so grateful I stumbled upon your video!
Where's your reselling videos Dork?
Instead of spending money on magnets, just buy a stud finder.
Ewww HOOKED ON PHONICS FAILED AGAIN!
I've been using that method for ever. It really works
Excellent tip!  I'm gonna use this one from now on :)
You'll never find me hanging out behind your wall no matter what tricks you use....lol.
We have the electric conduit in the walls will that affect it? Or pipes? New Subbie here excellent tip thank you 👏
First time seeing this, thank you!
great idea, thanks!
This is what my contractor showed me.
Good video. Hobby Lobby sucks though!
This is the way some of the cheap stud finders work. You just move the stud finder along the wall until it sticks.
Just browsing YouTube and BOOM!  A problem I’ve dealt with for years is now solved!  Amazing!  Thank you!
Awesome! I have some of those magnets on my fridge!  I think I'd trust this more than my stud finder.  I needed your help for the ceiling to hang a swag light,   Thank you.
You thought of this? You came up with the idea? Well, guess you created all the those devices over the last many some decades using magnets to detect nails or screws in walls. Must be a multi-millionaire by now. By the way, found another video claiming he came up with the idea, and yet another. Hope you copyrighted this ingenious invention of yours.
Word!!!  Thanks bro
Thanks for the great video! :)
yessiirrr
Wish I would have seen this before buying 2 stud finders that didn’t work
Really cool, cause I just got a new apt. Need to hang photos, draperies.Thanks
I wish I knew this 20 yrs ago
If you need to fix to just plasterboard if no studs can be found try Bullfix Plasterboard Fixings Bullfix Plasterboard Fixings
Went straight downstairs and got a strong school locker magnet off the fridge! It worked great. Thanks friend.
Thank God for people like this
Hooray!!! Thank you, Sir!!! Hee I love this. Makes me feel smarter:))
Amazon sells a $10 stud finder as well lol
The best stud finding method I’ve ever seen. Thanks for the knowledge!
"Next check out my Super Easy Getting Dry After Being Wet Trick! UPDATED! In which, I had this brilliant idea: I got these things called 'towels', which are like, SUPER absorbant, and..."  ...  Your amazeballs "trick" is a magnet.   /sigh
Thank You! Apartment i live in has studs that are irregular. Magnet is showing me that. 16" then 15 1/4 then 15...on and on. Thanks again.
Cool...thank you!
I bought a stud finder years ago that was 3 magnets that moved as you went across a nail.  The distance between nail & studs is usually 18" or 24" to line up with 4x8 sheets of dry wall.  I tried to explain to my daughter what a stud finder was.  She said she thought a stud finder was when a girl lifter up the hood on her car.
Why not just knock ✊🏽 on the wall and ceiling dude? No damage and no out of pocket cost. Cause what if you get a nail or screw that’s not in a studd?…
Doesn’t work on my walls (plaster)
Brilliant tip, thank you.
Dead serious “I made a decorative magnet so it kinda looks like a trees growing out of your fridge” 😂😂😂😂 that’s awesome
Yr a genius!! This was very helpful!!!!
This trick will stick with me. Thanks for sharing.
Try that again on a textured wall.
Video starts at 3:40 ...fuckin idiot
Great Idea,Thanks.
u have a little star on ur measuring tape usually the width of ur stud wall my friend
I just use the magnets without the dowel
Wait not actually doing the deed?
There are "magnetic stud finders" that have a magnet inside and a small compass like needle that sticks straight up when it finds a stud, it has worked better than any of my electronic stud finders in most occasions.
Answer at 3:20
wow. Genius! Good technique!
I'll keep a horse shoe small magnet in my tool pouch for now on instead of my bulky stud finder when I need it or annoying battery week signal...nice Thanks 😎👍
Nice
YES, for decades & decades 16" on center was the rule. BUT, lately more N more builders are going to 24" on center. I have a 2018 manufactured home & I found in my master  walk in closet studs are 30" on center! Is this throughout my  house? Who knows. I'll find out by & by. Magnets is how stud finders work. Good idea. I'll give it a try. The dewalt stud finder I have does not work for shit!  !
I'm going to be looking for a joist in a popcorn textured ceiling and had the rare earth magnets in mind.  Hope they're strong enough to get through the popcorn.  :)
I got a black an decker stud finder with laser for $5 and included a case on clearance at Walmart.
My teeth were worse than yours and I got Smile Direct Club...not a sponsor. It took 9 months.
The smaller diameter  of the "rare earth" magnet the better for accuracy- try using half-inch and stack them for more power. Add a piece of metal to back-end of magnet and double its strength.  Been doin this for over thirty-five years, way past Dorks Lifetime. Clients watched and I never shared publicly. Good for you Mr.DD
Great diastema!
This is the oldest trick in the world...any magnet works...
Stop filling time and get to the point...
Lol...cool...I will try this..Thanks!!.....Because  I had bought a stud finder tool....kinda trash
Great idea.  Thanks for sharing.
Really ? Idiot !
Myself, and all my future walls thank you
Awesome idea, thanks so much for sharing!!!
Oh my goodness! What an awesome idea! Thank you for sharing.
friggin bloody brilliant.  You are a legend.  cheers
this is super helpful! thank you for sharing, I never seen this trick before
I heard you can rub a couple of pieces of steel wool together,  in front of the wall where you think there may be screws in the stud ( after exposing them for a few seconds to a strong magnet .) Fine pieces of steel wool will then stick to the nail or screw heads and no need to tape anything or mark with pencil...and when you are done, just blow the fine particles of steel wool away, just as easy as blowing out a birthday candle. You're welcome! 😉
Wow! Thx
go straight to 3:00  your welcome.  Why do you tubers love to listen to themselves talk??
Bravo!!!!!!
Thanks!
How do u find a Joist in the ceiling? I want to put up a swing chair in a bedroom. Also can u drill into a stud? Thanks for the tip. Just gone round the house with a magnetic I was surprised to find it stick heheh
Do u think this is the same in UK houses?
Will this work even with a wall that's textured/ popcorned?
use your used vibration tooth brush magnet
This is amazing. Thanks so much for this information. LIFESAVER BRO
this works great if you have wallboard.  nearly impossible if you have an old house with plaster on lath.
Do studs/joists run vertically or horizontally? Can you drill into the area near to where the magnet sticks?
Ohhh that’s so cool. It’s much easier than stud finders. I could never figure those out.
ceiliing joist too with plaster and lathe?  thanks
are those magnets strong enough for plaster and lathe ?
How would it work on plaster walls
Great idea, but you have to make sure that you buy the strongest magnet and then find something to glue the magnet to.  Then, in order to find the stud, the magnet needs to find a nail.  All of this takes time and frustration.  You can buy an electronic Craftsman stud (not nail) finder for as low as 10 bucks on Amazon and I'm sure others in your local DIY store or Walmart.  Those find the stud; so much easier and worth the few bucks more.
THANKS.  I use 2 magnets holding a string and swing back and forth to find one. I have dozens of magnets, so I just leave one on the each spot.  You can find 'Rare Earth' magnets on ebay.
This trick just saved my husband and I from unnecessary work. Thank you!
Great information! Thanks for sharing.
Such a great teacher!
Super cool. Super useful. Thank you :-)
Good idea but you could have done it in 60 seconds
What if they are brass screws?
This method is nothing new. Magnetic stud finders have been around since the 1970's.....Stanley still makes them for $5.   These were forgotten once the electronic stud finders came out.  Search Amazon "Stanley 47-400 Magnetic Stud Finder"
Save me a lot of holes and time. Thanks so much!
Roc Wazere
What about button board and plaster?
Very helpful, thank you
There is a lot of talk before he shows his trick.
So great!! :-) Thanks
There such a thing called a stud finder....
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Hanging a vertical radiator soon so I’ll be trying this out. Sounds a great idea. Thanks.
I like this guy. "No math, no brains..." Perfect for me!
😃👍💯
Nice video!  Rare earth magnets are pretty amazing. I used a doughnut magnet hung by dental floss and when it finds a nail you can put a little x through the hole and as you go up and down you get a line of X's you can use to find the center.
Genius never heard of this
But that does NOT give you the center of the stud!!!! You can be on the edge and a screw will not hold well in the edges. The wood will splinter....
Clever !
What about lathe and plaster where there are nails everywhere!
I’d never seen this before—great idea!
Why Not a Stud Finder  🤔 $5
But, what do you do if you have plaster and lathe?
If you’re in a Pulte home like mine, go ahead and measure 17, 6, 19, 10, or whatever inches on center.
Popcorn ceiling makes it hard to use nearly any method of stud finding. I’m resolved to just poke holes until I find the joist. :(
I was today old when I seen this.  Future projects will be a little faster. Thanks for this.
Nice trick, wires or other metal might send misleading information though, make sure you survey a large part of the wall.
wholly molely thats cool!!! thanks!!!
Buy a $30 stud finder🤦🏻‍♂️
Great!
Why not just use a stud finder?
Drywall is fairly easy. Those old plaster walls is tougher for my stud finder. Sometimes I drill holes to be sure.  I like the magnet idea.
Wow 🤓
Neat trick better than those useless stud finders.
The magnets are called neodymium magnets. thanks to YouTube, eBay, Amazon etc, the proverbial everybody seems to have thought of it.
EVER DREAM THIS MAN?
Now if I could just find an easy way with two coat plaster walls.
my 70 year old mom told me the magnet trick a while ago lol
Wish I would have watched this before drilling twelve holes in my ceiling. Haha. Stupid stud finder from home depot is garbage btw.  Magnets it is.
That is a genius idea thank you very much and help me out tremendously
Magnetic stud finders have been around for years.
I'd be sliding that magnet around forever b4 I hit a screw I bet
Okay, so my “boyfriend” puts tape over a  very strong “push pin” type magnet to protect the paint or wallpaper from any scratching to do this. I love him.
Walmart shopping 2:10
The trick is 2 min into a 4 min video
What the hell???? Almost 5 minutes to say what could have been said in 1 minute... JHC guy, get a life.
Studs are in the walls. Joists are in your ceilings and floors. Thought you’d like to know
good
Nice teeth skippy!
It was so much fun watching MrDiyDork and to learn about all the methods he's used to find studs. Thumbs up up UP!!!
Hot glue a magnet to string, hang it like a plumb level, it will draw itself to a screw.
there is a magnetic tool that does the same job. about 1.45. put a search on google.
Well if I mudded your wall just look for the screw indentations lmao.
I already put put 4 holes on my wall before going to youtube and found this
Awesome....Thanks!
We used to use that trick to disassemble a wall to make an interior fix and then put the wall back. It made for minimal patching.
what about a plaster wall?
Uncle Buck is that you.. lol jk nice stuff man
Brilliant. Our house is an eclectic mix of it’s many owners additions. There’s nothing standard at all.  Thanks for your help.
It really worked, thanks a lot
I put my magnet on the end of an extending metal backscratcher 🤷🏻‍♀️ & the magnet just sticks to the wall when I cross a screw. Works best for the ceiling (in moi opinion)
There has been a gadget out for some time with three red arrows in a row up and down in a plastic case with magnets behind them. Simply  move the gadget around the wall and when you see one of the three magnets "stick" to a hidden screw that's where the stud is.
or you can use a stud finder...
You guys don't just look for the hump in the mud? Doesn't work on smoothwall or really heavy texture. Now brains required though.
Clever ass if i know where are the screws i basically know where that fuck is the stud. What i nned to know is how to find it to put the screws imbecil.
Ok well Believe it or not that’s an old trick let me give you a hint the magnets does not work on wood studs LOL so what’s the easiest way for that pal thanks for your videos 👍👍👍
You are a genius!
Why not just get cheap stud finder??
OMGosh-AWESOME!  I am buying a house and I need all the great ideas I can get so thank you :-)
Couple of 5 dollars magnets much cheaper than the 45 dollar stud finder that I bought and lost in 3 garage some were
Cheers from Australia 🇦🇺 loved it
Omg! 😆  Wish I knew this about 20 holes ago😒 Thnx for this  For next time
Outstanding !! Thanks for creating this easy method
Yep a magnet , find the nails already in the drywall that are in your framing. Cool to make some kind of a handle as well!
You are the man!
I've been using this method for years and it work pretty well as long as the drywall installers put the nail in the stud. But there is never a guarantee they hit the center of the stud either.
Sounds great if you have a newer house. My house was built in 1900. No Sheetrock, no nails. Not even a light switch on the wall.
Wow 7 min in he finally said how to do it
Great idea but how do you find the center of the stud?
Very helpful tip. I have a stud finder but I dont really trust it. This is a great way of reassuring and also make sure I dont drill where the nails are.
Back in the ancient times we used a stud finder. Before that, you couldn’t find them. (I’ve read some people commenting that stud finders don’t always work. Go ask someone besides your wife.)
What about for bead board walls?
danggg son im just to late for this. plenty of holes needs to be patched
I jus don't see how a maggot could help you find a stud.
Shit this video is old. I thought I just discovered that a couple months ago. 😔
Hell yea grabbed my level magnet it worked time to hang punching bag!! 👍😎
We always try to over engineer things,sometimes we overlook the easiest ways to get results,thanks
Studs in the ceiling, huh?
Been telling everybody I know about this for years.
I like it!!
I use a rare earth magnet from an old hard drive.  I drop it into a ziplock baggie and tie or tape a string to the bag.  That way it doesn't mar the wall surface.  It will also work double duty to pick up screws and nails from the ground.  No need to bend over anymore to pick them up.
I use a stud finder.. Works extremely well to find each side of a stud.
I've been using this for years. A little bird told me and as I am a cheap guy I got it.
Add a plumb Bob to the  dowel
It’s probably already mentioned in here but I attach a string with a washer at the end of the string and use that as a guide to find the nails below in line with the one you found. Easy trick. Just tape the string to the magnet.
Speaking so fast it's hard to understand half of what you're saying !
Wow, worked great.  Thank you so much for the info!!
AWESOME hack. Thank you!
How does a magnet find wood!!! It’s not a stud finder it’s a nail finder!: anyone care to explain!
Super idea👍🏾💪🏾🔥😎
My brother-in-law gave me a magnet stud finder years ago and I still use it. Great, simple product
HOW DID YOU GET RID OF THE POPCORN CEILING?!?
then how to determine it is not the egde of the stud.
A magnetic stud finder has been marketed for years, and I have one, but I like your idea better.
Buy a stud finder and k.i.s.s keep It Simple Stupid
What about wing boxes? They can go any place
Hello, love the idea. Are neodymium magnets the same as rare earth magnets? Thx
I always use magnets to find the drywall nail heads.
New knowledge to me! Thanks! I plan on hanging shelving in my garage and this will help me save a ton of time!
Nice video
How do you know its a screw or nail and NOT a water pipe?
Does this work with metal studs ? Asking for a friend
Need help. I am trying to hang shelves but every place along all my walls have electrical lines and I can’t find a stud that don’t have electrical lines. I’m using Stanley stud 150 finder.
Why go to all that trouble and expense when you can get a cheap magnetic stud finder at a home improvement store for a couple of bucks?🤷🏻‍♂️
Just go to the hardware store and buy a stud finder...
Paid almost 100 dollars for a stud finder that  gets confused by electrical wires and pipes. Ima go get me a 5 dollar magnet right now.
Did you say Earth magnets?
Joists and rafters are rarely 16" OC. Most of the time they are 24" or 19(2) OC.
Will this work for a mobile home?
Thank you so much! As this is BRILLIANT! And I think has just possibly saved a great disappointment for my daughter who we are trying to hang a chair from the ceiling for!
I dont care what techniques u use you will never find a stud in your ceiling.  Joists yes studs no
Great trick! THANKS
Very clever, thank you
Ever hear of a stud finder?
Good stuff, thank you!
How do I know what way the wood it going? Vertical of horizontal? And how wide?
Another easy trick is to use a small finish nail and hammer it in right on top of your baseboard into the drywall/plaster. You may even be able to see a nail in the baseboard. After finding the stud you can run a fine bead of caulk over the small holes and hide them completely.
OMG.  I cannot believe I didn't think of this!  Another example of how I'm dumber than I think I am.  Thank you for the cool tip!
This is a great frickin’ idea.
Just knock on the drywall. Oldest method ever...
Dude, love it. Thank you.
1 minute of content, took 4 minutes.
Great idea 😀 no math no brains 🤪
Silver magnets
They have been making magnetic stud finders for decades
My tv and wife thankyou very much!!🤭🤣
Cool, thanks much
.......... and if your studs are wood..........?
One more hole in my wall it will be invisible
I just installed a tv mount in my living room for my 65 inch tv. I couldn’t mess around by taking a chance on missing a stud for the support. I have a stud finder but it was inaccurate. I had to “explore” with a small nail and I found a stud after about 10 tries. Wish I would have seen this video first!! I’m saving it for the next time. Great job explaining!!!
Get a new microphone dude.
What a great idea
Excellent tip thank you for this video
What about older homes that don’t have drywall s
Use a magnetic spirit level, you’ll be needing it to get the mount level too. 👌🏻
And you know where the fasteners are?
I live in a very old house with original sheet rock, will this method still work?
👍thanks.
What's up with the gays?
Nice!! Thank you for showing us this Trick.
Great tip.  Thank you.
Wow... Thank you!!! I just so happened to have magnets and tried it..... AND IT WORK!
I live in Florida (hurricane country) I think I have Aluminum studs on cinder block exterior walls. Does that sound right?
That’s how a stud finder works
I just get out my Zircon Pro55, and as an added bonus, it detects live AC wires!
Or $8 @ depot n buy  The Magnetic stud finder that is made to do this.   .... NOT A NEW IDEA
i made one assumption with my builder---assume whatever he told me is bullshit
6 bucks it's called a stud buddy at Home Depot disclaimer if you have plaster walls or ceiling the magnet may or may not be strong enough to locate a fastener
Will the magnet connect to a water pipe by chance? I drilled into one thinking it was a stud last night...
Very creative and impressive ...will pass this trick on 🤙🔨
Be careful . In the beginning he says to take the electrical cover off & stick a nail in to find what side the stud is on . MAKE SURE YOUR POWER IS OFF before doing this or you could get SHOCKED .
Rather than tapping nails in a wall trying to detect a stud, leaving small nail holes all over the wall, that & often when pulling them out, a small scab of plaster can come off.  A method I use is both simple, fast and doesn’t require repairs to the small nail holes & maybe scabs of plaster too.  I put a 3mm drill bit into my drill and drill a hole just level with the top of the skirting board in to the wall, moving along until I find a stud. I then drill either side a couple of times to find the exact sides of the stud. Then it’s a simple matter of measuring 16" or 400mm, depending on how old the house is. I’d the drill a tiny hole to verify I’m on centre for the next stud, still drilling the holes just on the top edge of the skirting.  Then all I do once finished is run a very thin bead of decorators caulking all the way along the length of the skirting. No fuss, no mess, nothing visible and quick. Job done.
Great idea! Thanks!
Thanks for taking the time to do this for us!
This is called American Ingenuity.
I always use fishing magnets some older walls it still is hard.
You talk too much!😷😷
ingenious!
Just use a magnet 🧲 find the screws within seconds
You need to get rid of the first 4:05mins, on and on trying to sell
My stud finder wasn't working but this did instantly. Time to return this junk.
Thanks for sharing
It works. Thank you so much.
Why not just buy a stud-finder? https://www.amazon.com/Johnson-Project-Stud-Finder-Level/dp/B0044UOB7U/ref=sr_1_13?dchild=1&keywords=stud-finder&qid=1603790291&sr=8-13 You can buy one also at Lowe's, Home Depot, and most hardware stores.
Will this work on only plaster walls?
Seem magnet would  be best for plaster and laths boards, sucks they don’t make good enough stud finders and  you have to dance a magnet on a wall looking for a screw.
is this a joke? a stud finder is like the cheapest thing in the world.
I know you posted this video 5 years ago, but Man you save my life. I had been trying to locate studs on my ceiling for  3 days and took back to Home Depot, Lowes and Harbor Freight five stud detectors because they were all giving me a false read. I started to give up until I found your video and man that magnet trick had me locate my studs in 5 minutes.   That was really a great video and I applaud your efforts. Again thanks so much for helping someone who was getting no satisfaction with the conventional methods.
Excellent
Can you do that with plaster walls?
Thanks.
This does work, but how do you know if the screw is in the center of the stud
Guy I love you
Great trick! Works better than the cheap stud finder I bought today. if you want a very strong magnet for free, open an old full sized hard drive. That's where I have mine from. It's a part of the mechanism that moves the reading head.
Video starts at 01:55
I think this is a GREAT idea - do you know how many holes I’ve knocked in walls or ceilings, trying to find a stud!? The stud finder could be put to use or was ineffective - GREAT IDEA!
yes!!!
@1:45 My first guess was to maybe use a magnet, and then immediately you pulled out a magnet 😂
Wow, excellent!  I’m sure the stud finder industry hates you.  Ha ha.  Great job fighting that out; these stud finders are never easy or straightforward to use and costs money.  Many thanks!
talks way too fast - cannot get the name of the magnet !!!!!!
What a great idea. I already had some large rare earth magnets and it took me about 15 seconds to find a nail. I confirmed the stud was there with a Zircon HD55 stud sensor (also a very good tool). The Zircon placed the stud in the exact same spot.
Too much irrelevant info made you talk too fast on the relevant parts.
Too much preamble!! ... Thank you, though.
I needed that, now the kids refridge paintings will suffer and fall!
New to me
Too much wasted time with bull shit before he got to the point.
Or get a stud finder. End of story.
At home depo they have a stud finder it's a large magnet cost about 9. Bucks
Dude...you are brilliant.
I have owned half a dozen stud finders and have found out that a magnet is my best option.
smart method. Thanks!
Thanks man. Thats real useful to know
Logged in just to give a like, I was getting desperate but I had a magnet and boom!!, Life saved.!
get to the fuckin point
The neodymium magnets (rate earth magnets) are cheapest at Harbor Freight. You get like 8 of them for about $2.50. This idea is genius btw, thank you!
Nice how bout ceramic tile
Last comment... stud finders don’t work on lathe and plaster ceilings and walls, so this is a great idea
I’ve just spent another 4 minutes looking through all of the comments about how long-winded this video is, so I’m down 8:44, hopefully I’ll get that back in time using the method 👍🏼
Great idea, which you could have told me in ten seconds flat, but thanks 👍🏼
A perfect common sense solution.  I am pretty sure I have a stud finder somewhere in the garage that really did not work as well as this idea.  Love the magnets too.
Thank you so much! 💟 I'm just trying to put my dance pole up and im so nervous.
Before drywall screws. There were aluminum ring nails. So much for the magnet trick if you have an old house.
3:20
😱🌪
Really helpful !!!! Thanks
You talk to much get to the point
Fantastic! What a genius idea.
New to me!!
Oh my god that’s awesome I just stuck a magnet to my wall!!!! Thank you!
Very cool. I happen to have a couple hundred neodymium magnets I created for transmission pans and oil filters. About ten times bigger than the ones you showed. You literally have to pry them apart. They should work great for this. One question, do you find things other than stud nails? Do you eliminate them with following down the stuff to confirm?
It was very helpful to find the studs with this method! Thanks a lot I wouldn’t have thought about that lol
2020 single mommy of three- thank you so much♡
Never saw that! Great trick
Genius. Thanks brother. Now I can hang my picture frames.
thank you
Great trick but you took way way too long to get to the point........
Thank you!!
My walls are poured plaster. Thx for everyone who commented ao i can actually find useful info
The other trick is to use my knuckle. If you have you a stethoscope, that helps to hear the difference in sound when you knock on the wall. If knuckle hurts, use a screwdriver to knock on the wall. With all the tech we have today, still no one has ever produced an X-ray stud finder. Where's Iron Man when you need him. Even KITT could find the studs.
I've always used magnets to find studs. Now I found a device that can find studs, metal tube/bar, and wire. I'll order that one soon. The Neodymium Iron Boron magnets are the strongest. I've always used them for almost everything. However, they can be brittle.
“It takes a lot of force to take these off”  *proceeds to slide it off with ease
This is a reminder of what happen when we allow technology to take over our independence to think for ourselves.
You are one smart man. Thank you.
As a woman DIYer, I love this trick! Thank you! Oh, by the way, all of you negative men are all just blowhards who think he was talking to you!
What if you have a  havy Stucco ceiling
Hi, will this technique work through the bumpy surface of a popcorn ceiling?
Brilliant!  Thank you!  My stud finders were NOT working on a stuccoed, interior garage wall and this was simple.  Slightly ashamed that I hadn't thought of it! 🤣🤣
Just go to 3 min, this guy just talks a lot, scheech
Awesome! You're smart! You just solve my long time problem of finding the studs in my house! thank you so very much!
Unfortunately my house was built in 1912 with plaster and lathe and every pc of lathe has multiple nails in them throughout the wall
Would this work through wood?  Wondering if it would to find joist in a porch ceiling which is wood.  House is over 100 years old so not sure if they used the standard measurements of spacing things as we do today...
4mins to say that...
you talk too much... get to the damn point... time waster
Is it possible people are using too thick of drywall? Finding studs with a stud finder is a joke in this house. The ones you CAN find are somewhere between 15” and 18” on center. I’d love to kick whoever built this house in the balls 40 times over.
Oh my goodness, thank you!!! You have no idea what you've done. I've been completely stymied by seemingly roaming studs, according to two different electronic stud finders. I was just about to give up. Thank you!!
wait a minute, this isn't Fleming's left-hand rule!
Great Idea, I had just bought neo magnets too!
Thanks great trick! Subd!
I just my xmen friend magnetron over n bribe him w cold beer
Gonna try right now!! Thanks dude...
Great trick, however for those watching, you really only need to watch the last minute or so of the video because the rest is irrelevant information. Almost turned video off it took so long to get to the point of the video
Dork on!!!   Pay no attention to the naysayers!  I love this video.
Great tip, thanks!
Thank you for this great video! I will save a few bucks
Ummmm, you can by something similar at c.t. for decades ... Nothing new. Second, your method assumes the screw was installed in the center of the stud .... not always the case and making such an assumption can be a problem in the future.....
I want to mount a tall cabinet from Ikea in my Garage.I bought an earth magnet from bunnings after watching this video, I found a few vertical straight lines with magnet sticks on, and space is exactly the same between each vertical line that magnet sticks on, I thought I proved myself that I'm finding the studs 100% right and 100% confident. Now I have 3 holes on my wall... didn't find any studs....
Learn something new everyday.  Thanks for sharing.
Use a stud finder
This is amazing !!!! Totally just found this and loving using this trick !! Thank you !!!!
Great video bro! This is a great idea!
nothing new here...  he makes it sound like he just discovered it. there has been magnet stud finders on the market!
I have magnets, now I can find studs.
Incredible
Thank you thank you thank you!!!
Those of you who use Sonic toothbrushes, one they're used up, keep them. They have neodymium magnets and they work perfectly for this use. Thanks to MyDiyDork, for this brilliant idea.
Dude you like to TALK too much!!!! Everybody knows that you are smart, so just give us the information in a very short message. Geez!!! Otherwise thanks for the information.
Hey man that is the best I have seen I will try it myself thanks mate
Genius! Love this no brainers method! I'm needing to find studs behind a culture marble shower surround and didn't want to poke holes in the drywall. I will definitely give your method a try!
Talked too much and not enough demonstration!
Thank you for this tip! I was getting so frustrated with my stud finder! It would say there’s a stud, I’d drill and nothing. Used a magnet 🧲, it stuck, I drilled and BAM!! A stud! I gave my stud finder away! This will be my only method of finding studs! Again thank you!!!!
Lol this actually worked hahah nice man
New to me! Thanks!
That's great! I been working on houses for half my life and never seen or thought of the magnet trick before.  I've used a number of useless stud finders over the years that are always a hit or miss but the magnet is 100% best thing next to putting a bunch of nail holes in the wall or ceiling lol I appreciate it bro
Talk, talk, talk, talk, yak, yak, yak, GET TO THE POINT....
thanks this was helpful
Not all dry walls are screwed, often drywall are screwed around the perimeter and glued to studs and noggins. Youre better off locating the rather than looking for screw fixings. I've been in the trade for 55 years and get a 100% success rate by gently tapping the drywall with the back of my finger nails, you can her when you're close to something solid.
Good thinking bro thanks
Stud Buddy. No more need be said.
Amazing, can’t believe I never thought of that.
Awesome! Thanks!
Extra tip on a finished surface put a piece of paper between the magnet and the wall then you can slide the magnet around without scratching your surface. I tried the magnet trick only to find that New Zealand drywall is glued on not screwed,sometimes life just sucks!
Great to see a nice-looking lad with no tramp stamps, hog rings, etc.!
great idea, thank you for sharing.
Thank you!  Wish I saw this video BEFORE putting my faith in the stupid studfinder and making numerous holes in my ceiling! 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
This is a fantastic video but it could have been sixty seconds long including intro/outro. Not everyone wants to watch until 3:40 to see the actual trick. Just sayin'.
Thanks 😊
Question. I need to find studs on a ceiling. How can I know If the screw I find is on the same stud as the previous, of if it's a different stud?
This is the best way!!! Even earlier than a stud finder!!!
Thanx for the tip!!! I have a couple of huge magnets I can now use to hang a heavy chandelier! Love how you made yours decorative too, throwing a little crafting in the mix lol.
Dude....thx!
Dude....thx!
FAR TOO MUCH chatter before getting to the point.What a waste of time.
Thanks! Totally works!
Super helpful. For me it worked even better if I used a stud finder app on my phone first - which uses the gps/compass sensor to detect metal- to narrow down approximately where the screws were and then use the magnet in that area to find the exact location.
Hahaha Thanks Bro!!! Save me money buying a Stud finder!! Wooohoo all the way from Australia 😊👍
Super helpful video. Thank you!
what' wrong with stud finders?
4 minutes 44 seconds of blah blah blah.   DUDE!  this vid should be 90 seconds long!
MrDIYDork is the stud
The most foolproof and fastest way I know of to find a stud?   Have some friends over, drink a few shots, then have one of them bet you $40 that you can't punch straight through the drywall to the next room, while they record it on their phone, and in front of 17 of your other friends.    BAM!  Stud found.       That video was worth every penny.  All 4000 of them.  😂😂😆
or buy a stud finder.
Wow. How simple and yet I would've never thought to do this. Thank you !
It’s not only solves a problem I currently have have but involves magnets! 🧲 Magnets are my favorite hobby. I also really like Ghouls. Anyway, awesome video!
I enjoyed every bit of this...I gotta hang heavy stuff so...ty👍
Great tip, thanks!  :)
Thank you!
For another $5 you could buy a stud finder.
I use this method aswell but it doesn't guarantee the screws or nails are on center
you take a level and then guestimate.  hey stupid, the tools were literally created so you no longer have to fuckin guess you moron.
Get to the fucking trick already
hey great idea! I saw a video where someone used a "magnetic stud finder" but its $12 HA imma get me a $6 super magnet. woot :)
Neodymium magnet.
Put some tape over your magnet so you're not scratching the shit outa your wall.
Thank you, that’s so clever.
My 350 lbs pulling force neodymium magnet used for fishing found these studs easily! Great video!
Mrdiydork: “this works perfectly” Stainless steel screws: “hold my beer”
This video only needs to be 30 seconds long
Bro you talk wwwaaayy too much my guy🤦🏿‍♂️. Just get to the point
That's nice, but, now a days one can simply download an app for the Android or iPhone for free that will do the same thing. Time marches on....
Great idea.  Thanks
You saved me. My man!!!!
Tot locks work really good too
Slick trick. Even a girl can do that one. Lol
Brilliant! This saved me when installing a projector on my ceiling. So smart, thanks for sharing
Perfect! Thank you
Worked perfectly! Thank you I have shear walls with OSB wood backing behind the drywall so stud finder wasn't working at all. This is perfect I have my studs mapped out. So happy. I was really worried about this project.
At that point, you can just go buy a stud finder instead?
Awesome!!!
less than a minute! thanks dude
Build up way too long
What a discovery......................
Use a magnet.
If you open up a broken hard drive (the drive that is dead, doesn't spin anymore), you'll find a strongest magnum in the world inside.
HORRIBLE...and his parents didn't buy  tooth straighteners
Love the channel name. 👍
Nice video.  After buying 3 different electronic stud finders over the years I ended up with the same solution after noticing this one on Amazon:  https://amzn.to/2Q49wDs
Don't need to watch this unnecessarly long video. The answer is a strong magnet to find where the screws or nails are.
Thanks a lot worked for me in my 1950 built house
I agree who cares if it old trick I like it I have used the half inch hole method it makes a mess then u have to sparkle thanks cool trick
It's a very good and helpful video.  I don't understand why people have to criticize videos, why not just say, "nice video, thank you" it's not that hard.......
U r damn genius
Great idea!
CLEVER IDEA  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good job
That's cool way to find stud!
great idea! For the magnet, I took apart an old computer hard drive, and removed the magnet. They are almost too strong! Lol
Brilliant!  i have not seen this trick before and I needed it to hang my daughters chair from the ceiling tonight!
As a builder I should have known this trick, but I didn't. I have a half-assed magnetic stud finder but the magnet is too weak. This idea, using a much more powerful rare-earth magnet, is so simple I feel stupid. Thanks!
Gosh this is his damn video, he can make it longer or shorter is up to him. If people bitch about the length of this video then go make a video for yourself because any good video needs a narration. Imagine what movies would be like when the hero "For the Sake of time for people in a hurry" Kills the villain within few minutes of the movie and gets it done and over with.
Best tip ever. We used a magnet out of a hard drive!
I start with magnets but sometimes sheetrockers will miss the stud or hit just the edge and just keep going. So I use a Zircon to confirm the edges. If still not sure I may use a small drill bit and probe around. It's important to hit the center if I'm hanging something heavy like a tv.
Hanson makes a device that does this with magnetsWay ahead of battery stud finder
Positively Brilliant!   and so cheap..I would never thought of it.
Why not just use a “stud finder”, 10 bucks at Home Depot 🤷🏻
Is it really that good that it can find studs in the ceiling then it should be able find studs in the bedroom!!
I tried this in my parents' house and while it works in doorways, it doesn't work on the walls themselves.  Do their walls have hardly any screws?!  There's even an area in the hallway where I can see where one drywall panel ends and another begins because there's a bit of a hump.
I found the best way to find a stud, is with a mirror...😄
I am a woman I had a hard time to find a stud by not damaging walls this one is totally new for me and I'm happy to find a new way of using a magnet thank you so much for this video
Or you could just spend the money on a stud finder and skip the magnets. I love how people over complicate things
Too much unnecessary talking.
Great tip.
The more you learn about anything the less people can b.s.  you great tip.
Good idea, thank you  sir!
Get a flashlight, turn off the lights, turn on the flashlight and place flat against the wall so beam of light is shining perpendicular to the studs. You will see every stud as a mild depression. Mark your studs. Done. Takes less than 15 secs to mark one stud and a minute or two to mark off an entire wall depending on it's size..
WOW that’s brilliant!
You could also glue a line of them on a short stick like a small ruler. Might be cool. Wider.
Mr. Dork: The plural of Dork is not Dork's. There's no apostrophe unless you intend it to be possessive, as in, Dork's tools, or Dork's fixes. Otherwise, the plural of DORK is just D-O-R-K-S. No apostrophe.
The first easiest way is to peck. On the wall and listen for density. Vs hollow.   Duh..
neodymium magnets.  keep them away from kids and animals, hard drives, cassette tapes.  I had five of them...  no clue what they are stuck to now..  if i get any again I will fuse them into a socket driver or something...
Wish I would have found this before I put 6 holes in my wall
Can you post the links of the brand of this magnet? I know you mentioned Amazon & Walmart but I can’t find it.
And here i go and buy one of those 150$ fancy laser stud finders. 🙄
"Dork" in the channel name is for a reason?!
Thank you for mentioning that the box was mounted to a stud now I have a starting point you rock
My studs are 18” apart and my light switch is not next to a stud. Apparently it’s hanging in limbo.
What a top idea. Thanks for that!  Cheers 😊
Great idea .... or get a stud finder for 19.99 .... but hey I like this idea ... this video got a LIKE ... thanks
I've had the "Stud Buddy" in my tool bag for several years. You can buy them for about $10. No batteries required. Low tech. Works like a champ.
Does Paul F. Tompkins have a brother?
Thank you!!
Only works if the screw is in the right place, also does not show center.
Will it work through tiled walls?
great idea thanks for sharing
Thank you I will use this method 😁
Congratulations you just discovered the method I’ve been using for 20 years. Here is the proper magnetic stud finder...  Rowley Professional Stud Finder. # 1 Choice of Homeowners and Professionals! https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015GQ21TU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_loTLDbPB9VSAZ
Sweet trick .. thanks for the tip
Electronic stud finders are f*ing useless. Good to know other methods.
Ceiling rafters are on 22 inch cnterso
You talk to much get straight to the point nobody wants to hear what you have to say just tell us how to do it and leave
Worked for me thanks buddy
Slow down how fast you talk we will understand what you are saying
Man I love him You learn something New Everyday!💯 This is a Great #Method
Sin-ter
16 inches on sinTer
wow shit this is great method, now i dont have to buy a stud scanner, install my tv and refund it lol, neat!
OUTSTANDING!!!
I have a similar method. I have 4 magnets epoxied to a paint stick that work just a little faster!
Wow, great hack. Thanks for the video 👌🏽
you can upgrade this good idea by using a fishing type rare earth magnet and tie a plumb line to the eye on the back of the magnet shows the stud instantly.
16" on Center is that the distance between your two front teeth?
Does this work on popcorn ceiling?
Thanks for this trick!!! Love it.
I like it
That works good kinda time consuming, use your knuckle or hammer and tap, listen for hard or hollow sounds
Jeepers do you like to talk!  5 second answer and you take 5+ minutes!
How do you know if the CENTER of the stud is to the left or the right of the magnet?
Buy a stud finder. 10 bucks.
Watcha going do when the poles shift? That bad boy will be finding Australia with no problem.
Awwwwwwesome so
You didn't show how to find a stud in the ceiling! Smh.
Could this be used outside to find studs under vinyl siding?
Easier method at 1:55
great video...but mean people out there....get a life lol
All good until you try it on my plaster over chicken wire walls
This is a follow up to my last comment. This worked amazing. Faster than the unreliable devices and cheaper with magnets. You rock
If only someone would invent some type of a device that you could just wave across your wall and it would light up when it senses a stud.
I love this. The studfinder are like Russian roulette and where I live there is no consistency in framing. Gonna try this next time
Wow!!! That was a lot of words for " magnet."
Thanks dude for taking the time to share this!!
Skip to 3:18. The first 3 minutes are intro. “Use a magnet to find the drywall screws.”
I have a electronic  stud finder  that works awesome.  But it does require batteries.  Thanks for the post.
90%of the time, book is on right side of the stud. Because most electricans are right handed
You learn something really useful...it's already a good day.  5* Thanks.
Wood wall studs?  What nails?
I use this trick to find alien implants!!
Dumb.  If you have to buy something just use a studfinder.
Omg this works so well. My boyfriend and I were trying to mount our TV and we couldn't find out stud finder. This helped out so much.
Cut to the chase!
You can pound on the wall lightly with the bottom of your fist and feel where the stud is  it’s more solid there
Geez pull off the corners
The studs in my walls are easy to find. I look at the top of the wall and see where the nail heads have backed out a little bit.
Neat idea. However. Save yourself some time and money and just knock on the wall. The tone will change when you get near a stud. Been doing it for over 20 years and it's never let me down.
Just use your ear and knock.   Nothing needed
Replace 5 minutes of bla, bla, bla with:" Use a magnet to find screws"
THANK YOU!
Friggin brilliant
You can find studs by tapping on the wall/ceiling with your knuckle
Ancient technique, ridiculously long video, and unlikable presenter represent the TRIFECTA.
Cool I’ll definitely use this one.
If you have a hard drive die, rip it open and pull the rare earth magnets out of it. I have a nice collection going.
Or you can buy what is called a magnetic stud finder for $8 on amazon..... which is EXACTLY... EXACTLY....EXACTLY what this is???(sarcasm)
Sometimes you'll find the metal plate that protects water pipes from someone driving a nail into the pipes
Oh my god, a magnet. DUDE, carpenters do this every single day. There are tools you can buy for a few dollars that have a magnet with a level built into it, too. LOL  Stud finder. Just use a stud finder.
Here's a trick....use a stud finder.
ceilings don`t have "studs"
OMG! You’re a genius, thank you!
Nice!
Thanks Dork!   I love dorks!! My kids are dorks too
You are in trade and you don't own an electronic stud finder !!!???
And the stick doubles as a divining rod so you can find water in your back yard.
Will this work on exterior stucco?
Or you could just buy a stud finder.
This is so incredibly helpful. My stud finder is useless and this is the first time I’ve ever found this trick. THANK YOU.
Okay, so in theory, he could have simply used the magnets without even opening the packaging.  I keep a torpedo level with rare earth magnets in my tool pouch.  Works great on the same principle.  You just have to make sure the level doesn't scrape the wall or it will leave marks.
Wow Your wife is lucky ! Cute and so smart !  Thank you !
yeah it's new knowledge for me as I'm a maintenance worker and this will be useful 2 thumbs up my man.
Waste of time here!   Get a face mask “Bucky Beaver”...
I know not everyone has a pinpointer commonly used in metal detecting but I have used mine for finding screws in drywall and then mark them with painters tape. The wall studs define themselves fairly quickly.
You are a fucking genius!
Smart idea!
Super little trick, thanks
I've seen it done with a mini metal detector but I prefer your method.
Very good idea.
I got a better and faster way partner but for the homeowner your way is good thanks
Punch it, Ull always hit the stud
Z
Thanks mate, you made that so simple, an old bloke like me really appreciates.
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE this tip! Thank you!!
Too much chatter...
An ace idea.  I was frustrated with my Stanley stud finder as on the ceiling it was beeping due to AC everywhere, so it clearly was useless on the ceiling.   Saw this and I already had a stack of coin-battery sized magnets of this sort, and it worked like charm.  This was way more effective than the Stanley has ever been.
Genius
This video gave me the confidence to hang a wall tv mount. Thanks!
Very nice
Good idea, but way too much talking this video should have been around 2 mins I had to fast forward.
I have to give credit where its due. Well done sir! I was actively doing this while listening in my garage with some old neodymium magnets pulled from old hard drives and it worked like a charm. After find the 2nd one you should be able to deduce the 16" center method moving left or right of where your started.
No brains is accurate...DFAQ is this ?
There aren’t any studs in the ceilings. They are joists.
Genius, thank you good sir-my family now thinks I’m brilliant and have hidden Carpenter skills.. time for me to get a tool belt boys!
Watch out for boxes that are add ons. No stud required.
Buy a durn stud finder.
Wow. And again, wow. You da man ! Thank you diy dork 👍
Wait till this idiot runs into a remodel box
I never thought of using a magnet to find the stud. I typically tapped the wall or used a studfinder which isn't always accurate. 👍
This is so cool, I love this idea!!!! YAY!
Do I literally need to go to the fucking store and buy magnets to find a stud or not?
So smart!
They call it a stud finder. 10 bucks home Depot
What do you tell a woman with 2 black eyes? Nothing, because you already told her twice.....
Excellent. never thought of this
I'm in construct(house remodeling) and I must say FUCKING GENIUS!!!
I have an old school stud finder that works from a magnet on a pendulum and an arrow on the other end that points in the center when over a nail or screw.
simple and easy, thanks.!!
Lol
Let's hope the studs are level.
Jeez! you coulda told us that in one sentence but you do like to drone on and on.
Cool tip... 👍
You just saved me so much pollyfiller 😂 Thanks 👍 👍 👍
walabot
Great idea! thanks for this genius and simple astuce to find studs
I tried the "poke a nail thru it" method on my ceiling for about 20 holes ... to find the joists run parallel to the direction I was going <eyeroll>. So I bought a studfinder. I use it at least once a month, so well worth it.
What if you have a wood stud
Thank you!!
Great vid thanks
Very smart 👍
Excellent video , problem solved for free . Had an old hard drive super strong magnet inside .
Pretty cool!
WTF I'll just borrow my buddies stud finder. It seems to be cheaper and fast then calling around, surfing the web, or driving around. I'll just shoot a text and it will arrive in a day or so.
🤯
Brilliant thanks
when your out shopping for your magnets ,,, why not just buy a stud finder and be done with it
Sometimes the simplest solution is the hardest to see.
Life saver for my job tomorrow :)
Great!
Get to the method  gesh
I appreciate this guys confidence, and good tip
Get to the point, man!  My goodness.
But my walls are plaster 🙃
U just blew my mind so simple thank you
Already use the magnet trick, but just wanted to say thanks. I actually didn't think of using tape or stickers for marking the studs. Your videos are appreciated.
love it!
Ceiling stud is every two feet instead of every 16  inches in  most cases
Just find a nail in one of the baseboards, measure from there. Never fails, you can always find at least one. Your trick doesn't work in older houses with plaster walls either.
Can you believe it? I have a drywall project to do tomorrow and I thought of this exact same thing just this morning but all I had was kitchen magnets.  Was Google listening to my thoughts that I found this video? Kinna creepy....
Simple, but brilliant !
I will have to try this. The 2 electronic stud finders I have are crap. They change the studs location every time I go over it.
Gotta love everyone criticizing the length of the video... THANKS FOR TAKING YOUR TIME TO MAKE A HELPFUL VIDEO. Geez people if these guys didn’t do this you would still be wandering around like an idiot trying to figure out what to do, which would probably take longer than the 4 minutes you bitch about 🙄
Genius idea....glad I found the video.
Much appreciate you sharing this trick... People kill me, so negative, don't pay attention, so critical... Too bad they don't make a magnet strong enough to find all the screws that are loose with unpleasant people!!
Nice... Beats a $12 stud finder from home cheapo. BTW Amazon sells rare Earth magnets cheap
Can you use this method to find electric wires and metal water pipes too?
Ceiling studs? Seriously?
This is such a cool trick just saved me many holes trying to mount tv wall mount...thank u
Hard drive magnets work well also. Thanks for the tip!
I bet you didn’t need a stud finder to find that gap in yer teeth
Great idea, could have used this earlier today to find studs,
Longest... Video... Ever...
👍
Dumb ass tie a string to it ...a pendulum 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫. Then let go of the string 🤭🤔🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑.
Great tip.
My dad use to knock on the wall to find it
no brainer is right...   I learned this in high school shop class in 1966 !   da....
In the old days before all of these fancy methods and tools, we used a hammer and lightly tapped on the drywall to listen for the solid sound versus hollow sound a stud makes. Real simple!
You’re right, good simple method!
There’s a little tool called a stud buddy, 10.00 Home Depot. Once you find one find the edge of the stud then measure 3/4” over for exact center.
What about plaster walls bud
Brilliant idea, thank you for sharing ^_^
At last!!   I lost you 2 years ago, found again!!!    Thanks for still making videos.       y
Just go to your  kids toy box and find one of those powerful little magnets that on the recall list.
all the screws in my house are hand carved from wood......
What if it’s wood studs?🥴
I found the stud 0:00
Yes - helpful for the "newb" - I'm usually looking for something "new"; but this dragged me through 3 minutes & 35 seconds of talk.talk.talk.talk.talk.talk........wow.  My mom would have split his skull after 10 seconds of wasting her precious time.  I guess I need to remember next time......Talky-Talky-McDorky takes forever to make a point.    LOL Still think it's nice of him to take the time to share w/others; but my gosh man.
U have poor magnets. use n52 neodymium eBay about $10 shipped measure about 70 x 40mm x 20mm thick
Great tip
THANK YOU!!!!
You have the most useful stud finding videos. Thanks to you I found a stud. He's on my screen in your video !
Dam you can talk ..... should have been a good 30 second video only and titled “Life hacks “
How long to find a small screw with a $5 magnet on a 4x10 piece of drywall compared to buying a $10 stud finder. I'll spend the extra $5.
this is fine, but you can also buy a stud finder, I got my own at https://amzn.to/2VVXqgM
great idea thanks
After 45 years in the biz, I can locate a stud by tapping on the wall. Wall framing can be on 16”, 24”, and sometimes 19” o.c.. The latter being an old framing method for (plaster) lath. The new technology is good for locating electrical and plumbing in a wall/ceiling.
Though not every nail or screw is in the very center of every stud on every wall.
Well holy moly what a clever idea !!! Thank you for the tip 👍😃
Thank you for the video. I am said to be bright, but it still helps me to see it being done.
Got bored after 1min in. Too much talking
Thanks help me out reall good thanks man
What happens when your magnet is hitting a wire?
Thanks for the tip  👍
In a pinch you can hold a light close to the wall to create a shadow and find the "mud marks" over the nail heads which will show even with several coats of paint. Been using that for years.
For what it's worth most electricians are right-handed so the outlets will be on the right side of the studs. Not always but it's a good place to start or double check...
Thumbs up from me dude. I have a wall that has an abnormal amount of metallic laminate of some kind behind the drywall, there's no electricity and my stud finder was allays telling me there was! I procrastinated for months on this. I just watched your video and BAM I just hung up my media shelf! I wish I would of found this out earlier! Thank you!
Great Video, Thank U!
And a much cheaper and quicker way is , knock on the wall like you do at a door when you want someone to answer , you will hear a solid knock vs. a hollow knock , how about that eisnstein
Why, oh why, does it take so long for some people to get to the point. I find it very frustrating.
I have a better idea. Take one of those rare earth magnets and tie a 24" string to it. Now hold the string 15 inches from the magnet and slide the magnet back and forth over the wall. The longer the string is from the magnet, the more sensitive your new stud finder. Works like a charm...but not on ceilings.
There's no such thing as studs in a ceiling.
Uhhhhhh…. huh????
Genius... thanks. I was about to pay someone booga booga bucks to find one flipping stud!
Just take a 16 penny nail and hammer it along a horizontal length of 24" every 1/2"  (maybe more depending on who built your house) and sooner of later you will find something solid to nail to. 😏
Thanks so much helped me so much I didn't have to buy a magnet had a basic on laying around and it worked
Great tip! Thanks
Anyone else catch that he said dyi?
So, studs are as wide apart as your teeth...got it 👍🏻
Great video! Was able to locate the studs in my wall with just a fridge magnet and some patients!
Notice how you don't point out that electricians use remodel boxes that do not Mount to studs
ZIRCON L550 BEST STUDFINDER EVER MADE FINDS TRUE CENTERS AND EDGES EVERY SINGLE F TIME!
Thank you sir!  you saved this poor man 15 bucks.  Also thank you comments....hard drive magnets worked..... the magnets that come in the Phillips hue motion sensors worked well also.
This is new to me, and it's a damn good idea. Thanks
There is a tool called a Stud Finder and extremely accurate. Find stud mark with pencil.
I have done sheet rock in the past but never thought about this method. Did this and found a stud right away so I'm able to set screws for future shelves Thank you
1:55 to get to the point
Excellent
Bro thank you so much I'm planning a Christmas party and I wondered how to install a floating shelf (For a picture wall), you just saved the party with this method thank you so much!!!!!!
I'm sure all these people meant to say Thank you, Thank you :)
Like it.
Trying the magnet trick but it keeps sticking to me.
great video! these are super helpful thank you!
can you show a link for the magnet?
Cool share thanks!!
Thanks. Just what I needed.
USE A MAGNET TO DETECT THE DRYWALL SCREWS (which are screwed into the studs themselves)  Yur welcome  Also maybe use a studfinder just to detect electric wires (they usually have a detector on them). More or less accurate, but may save you some burnt brain cells.
Doesnt work the magnets keep sticking to me
Awesome, thanks
Brilliant
I have plaster walls and ceilings..any idea on finding the ceiling joists? Trying to hang a pull up bar and I want to hit at least 3 seperate joists
Great tip.  Thanks.
Your a stud. Keep up the good work. 👍🏽🤪
You are an idiot .
Good little trick
I know  this is an older video ... Be careful too because not all studs are straights, not all studs are at 16 or 24in.  Today I did two medicine cabinets and one has a stud about 3-4 inches off, another I found literally had a stud for the 3 switch so I had an area with 3 studs technically 6in apart.  Now I gotta cut one down just to fit the damn cabinet.
Hehe, "No brainer", no kidding! I feel every bit as dumb as a box of rocks right about now! It's one of those things, soo obvious, that's it's nearly impossible to see. The fact that you "did", places you in a league, all your own! You are highly intelligent! Thank you and umm, please, let's just keep this between us, lol!
Great tip - thanks~
Some levels have magnets on them,but maybe not as strong.
hey cant his work for hanging upside down tree for xmas
SPEECHLESS??? 4:44 of my life wasted.
Dude this a good video thanks for the tip
this was the technique I've been trying to use, but the stupid kids who put up my drywall put nails willy-nilly. I'll have to use the method from your other video.
I'm a dork I can find the studs now..magnetsssss!
EAn even easier thing to dfdop is tie a string on the magnet and let it sway back and forth. I'tll find it quick
Knowingly moving a door that swings open and blocks the light switches?  Clearly knows more about finding studs than general construction/electrical best practices.  Yikes.
Fantastic video!  Thanks a bunch.
God, I’m such an idiot.  Thanks for this!
👏🏻🎉👏🏻🎉👏🏻✨🌟⭐️🌟✨😃👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻🎉👏🏻🎉👏🏻
Great presentation and when you said "no brains required" I Immediately  raised my hand...thanks
great stuff
Doing it for years use magnetic ball bearings  thanks anyway
Great video but I wish you would shut the fuck up and get to the point
Wow! Thanks for this wonderful trick!! I can't wait to show my exhusband! lol He always struggled with this!
Its called a studfinder.
You might want to slow down your speaking....not clear at all.
I unsubscribe this and it keeps coming back
Great Now how do we find the magnet to find the nail to find the stud
Been there done that.  Wasting my time.    Rare earth magnets.  Boring!!!
this method is shit and you didn't even tell us until 3:20
Love it
You talk too fast...
Home Shopping .....give this verbal diarrhoea dude a job.
Did the job for me.used the magnet from my mobile phone holder in the car.loving it 👍👈
For God's sake. Get to the point!!!!!
Great ! Wished I had seen this years ago .....Even with an electronic stud finder I have struggled to find the studing . In my experience , in the UK, they are not always at 16 or 18 inches or evenly spaced
I thought it was something else besides the magnet , just buy a Good quality stud finder so you know what is behind the wall it will tell you if is electricity, water line , sewer system or the stud plus I use the magnet .
Thank you for this video!!! This is very helpful to know! Saved me from buying a stud detector. :-)
Or you can use a 10 dollar stud finder.
Genius!
Perfect
Yes, Your tip worked. Thanks for sharing.
Thank you very much this helped me hang my retractable extension cord on the ceiling
I put a rare earth magnet on a string with masking tape. I swing it back forth across a wall until its sticks. Works on lathe where most studfinders won't work. Find the nail/screw find the stud. Been done for decades.
I effin love simplicity.... thank you
glad for hat well done
This video could have been cut to 30secs
Nice trick, ty. Though you could have spared us the first 3:20 min of the video and just showed the trick right away
Awesome
Aren't stud finders $10?  But still like how this explains the concept and a strong magnet is probably much more accurate then a cheapo electronic one
Dont they make stud finders for christ sakes
Brilliant
My house was built in 1883.  The studs are anywhere from 2 1/2" - 3 1/2" thick.  They are on 20" - 24" centers.  I just tied a strong magnet (from a can opened) onto a string.  It will find the nails without marking the walls.
4:00 that thing dropped like my confidence in this idea.
Wow. That's really brilliant. Thank you for sharing that knowledge. Genius!
I appreciate the effort but if I have to go to the store to buy a magnet, why wouldn't I just buy a stud finder
So does every ceiling have wood studs besides the metal ones?
Yap yap yap
I see the code is 16 inches...is that for outer walls only or all walls. I do understand not all builders follow this suggestion,....just asking a question about whether it is for internal walls separating rooms and hallways where you don't need the strength or is this for support walls only???
Did you figure out how to do plaster n slats
Excellent!!! Thanks.
should be a 30 second video
My God you blabber on and on and on
What about sheetrock over old plaster, it wont work cause the magnet will find the lathe nail!!!!!!!
you talk too damn much!! just get to the point motor mouth
Doesn't work on 100 year old plaster walls.
Shut the hell up and get to the point!  Use a magnet to find the screws or nails... 4 seconds max.
I usually just start ripping dry wall off....
I love this idea.
Sweet!
Very nice.  Found studs in seconds on my wall.
Lifesaver
Guys, invest in one high end stud finder for the entirety of your life and you’ll be fine. Sure shelling out 60-70 for a top notch one is pricey, but it will detect metal, wood, electrical, and be accurate within a 1/16 plus show the width.   Just don’t go out to eat two or three times and you’ll have enough and it’ll last you forever.   This method could work, or just find a staple or pipe or anything magnetic and you’d be off. Just do it right
Get to the fucking point geeze
Great idea!
Idiot
Worked great for me. Any small, strong magnet will work.
They sell stud finders that all they are is a magnet you run over the wall until it sticks.  I don't think they work well at all.
Damn just show it already
This worked perfectly!  I don't own a studfinder, but happen to have tons of the little rare earth magnets hanging around.  Saved me an added expense and a trip to the store.
Damm 444 minutes to sell magnets wow,
Ceiling joist??
what if the wall is plaster?
Dude.    That's brilliant.   Thank you.
the gap between your teeth is 16" on center too
Careful you don't hit a pipe!!!
This trick was new to me and so simple its genius. Thanks man!
Wow - great tip thanks !
Just buy a stud finder....
Great tip! Thanks for sharing.
What a great idea!!!
Better yet . Buy a magnetic stud finder for under 9 bucks here   https://www.amazon.com/CH-Hanson-03040-Magnetic-Finder/dp/B000IKK0OI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1521737221&sr=8-3&keywords=magnetic+stud+finder
u can do clever things with magnets!
I have used this trick to remove entire sheets of drywall at once. Nice and clean if you have the extra time.
I no longer feel smart....thanks.  Seriously.  I learned something entirely new.  Almost feels like I should already know this.
Cut to the chase bro.
Genius
You can’t find a stud in the ceiling because the studs are in walls. Joists are in the ceiling
What’s the name of this stud magnet, we’re can I get it at, please tell me, appreciate if you can help.
You need an Audio Guy WTF?...Good Vid Tho...
Genius!!!! What did you put to cover popcorn ceiling? I hate mine!
congratulations you just reinvented the stud finder my old man had back in 1978.
Great idea man. but took you 3 minutes to get to the point.
Seriously? i need to know how to find ceiling stud to hang a plant hook. much simpler way to find studs, tape measures are marked !!!
This is great.  That was the biggest dilema.
S   L   O   W      D   O   W   N  ! ! ! !
Just get to the point!
Great idea. Glad you made this video. Simple and clever. Thanks.
16" centers HA ! not anymore that was a long time ago when they build houses to last now builders are CHEAP ! they build on 24" centers
Unreal man ! Great video !
What a nice guy
Brilliant, Honestly I'd never thought of that :-)
Cool!
Most light fixtures internal above ceilings are also attached on a rafter that can be measured 16 inches on center.
How do you know is the studs are floating or flush to the ceiling
Hmm..I thought there rafters in the ceiling..studs though. lesson learned!
$20 stud finders work great!
LOL...... a 4.44 video and he gets to the point at about 3.30, then spends the remainder with obviousness......... ! Could have done the same video in 1 minute...
WAY WAY WAY WAY TOOOOOOOOOO MUCH EXTRA TALK.
ur suppost to hang a magnet on a string and it will find itself!!!
Very clever sure makes it easier then putting little holes in the wall. thank you.😊
It's a magnet - 03:20
I will bet you any amount of money that you can not find studs in the ceiling...
awesome, i will def try this!
Magnets are a great trick for old plaster and lath walls.  Most (cheaper) stud finders will struggle with these.  Buy some small  neodymium magnets (Home Depot, etc.) for a few bucks.  Use them directly on the wall - sliding them lightly around the wall until you feel a pull.  There is a nail in that location.  (The magnet may even stick to the wall).  Scan above and below that location... if you find additional nails in a vertical line then 99% chance there is a stud there.  Move over 16 to 24 inches and scan again.  You will find a pattern of studs (hopefully) spaced at regular intervals.  Another trick, if the nails are buried deep, is to tie/tape the magnet to a string and slide it along the wall while it dangling by the string.  It will tend to "stick" to the wall in places where nails are.
This wouldn't work for someone who has plaster walls.
He had to know where the screw was or you would be pushing that magnet all day
Just a thought... Do not use magnets and buy a studfinder that also checks for AC.  What if you are using this method and you move to the right and your magnet jumps to an area. Alright you think to yourself.  You pull the magnet from the wall and go down 20 inches.  Let's see if I can find a "nail" here you say to yourself. Immediately the magnet latches on. Wow, what luck!  You reach for your nail to put up your favorite picture of granny blowing you a kiss while standing on the beach with a skimpy two piece on.  ZZzzZZZap!  Now you're a christmas tree.  Your "stud finder" didn't find nails but instead a really large wire.  Or maybe, you're flooded by water as you nail through a water line.  Don't be discouraged, I like the idea.  Just be careful my friends.    Oh and, say hi to granny for me.
cool
Great idea, stud finder out magnets in. Thanks.
You "ARE" the Stud !!!💖💕
will this work when there is carpeting on the entire wall?
Thanks for this video! Wish I had found it before my husband drilled 6 holes in the wall!
An excellent trick - thank you for taking the time to share.  I've previously been taping in a thin nail, but I am now looking for strong magnets on amazon
You could have said this in 30 seconds in full detail. Too much waffle. But thanks, I'm off to put this great tip to good use.
I legit though of this before I searched. But I had kitchen magnets
Thanks for the thoroughness of the video it helped alot
THANK YOU!!!
Super AMAZING THANKSSSSSSSS NO MORE HOLES
Thanks
Genius
If I want to find a stud, all I have to do is look in the mirror.
Thanks, I can never get a stud finder to work right and knocking on the wall gives me nothing but sore knuckles.
At a most auspicious 1:11 our cosmic brotha was about to drop the hottest mixtape of all time!!!  Thanks for the awesome info. Edit: pause it at exactly 1:11. I swear its the best mixtape of all time @mrdiydork
Thanks for this vid. Love your common sence view. Great job.
5 minutes to say use a magnet on a dowel stick.
I LOVE YOU
I'd take a set of the magnets and glue them to a paint stirring stick at say 4-6 in spacing, then u could slide it around on the drywall.
That was so simple, thanks
Omg when does the video start dude.. Yikes
....way to wordy-life is too short....
Costco sells a phenomenal, very easy to use stud finder that even has a level on it. No home should be without one.... seriously!  $20 - $30 I think
Bloody hell, so much talking. I wouldn't trust any magnetic. What if a hot or cold water pipe sitting behind the plasterboard. Than you simple punch it through.
YOUR DOOR SWINGS TO WRONG SIDE. LOL!
Alright that's really cool. How did I not think of this!
it's ridiculous how many people had something negative to state about good information. Doesn't matter who figured it out first, etc.. The info was helpful to someone!
Yay! Thanks!
How would you find studs in a stucco wall? since the stud finder goes off with any metal?
Way to much talking to 3:24 ! Then he shows you a very old trick.  (Way to much talking.)
The best way to find water pipes is to drill thru them, they will burst with water. Bingo you now no where the water pipe is.
Duh
HEHE.... hey guys (just noticed this) who else during the entire video was wondering this....  as an example if you pause on 1:45 who else was wondering...... if i throw a 10 cent coint at his mouth,  and it flew PERFECTLY VERTICAL, Perfect 90 degrees.  *would it touch the sides of his front teeth*    LMFAO.. I'm betting it wouldn't, i'm betting i could throw 2 coins glued together and i'd still be ok hehe i couldn't help and stare at the teeth for the whole video
The fork you have in your hand is actually a BB slingshot and the magnet holds the BBs on the bottom, for easy access.   Go get yourself some bands and a pouch and have some fun. -CD
Gappp
Like a charm.  Awesome dude.
The gap between joseph migliores ears is bigger!  Bully!
Will it work on textured cielings?? You know the ones that look like sandpaper?
Parents skimped on the braces?
Another great video and idea! I can use this idea tomorrow. Thanks!!
Super smarts.!
Pretty slick idea
*This is the worst garbage data consuming CRAP on YouTube*
good idea!
Summary: Use a magnet to locate the nails in the stud. Why do Americans need so many words to say so little?
MrDiyDork you're an idiot.  However, I'm a bigger idiot having wasted 4.44 mins. watching this idiotic video.  Congratulations on your 1.5+M views.  I hope you become rich.
it's trusses in the ceiling not joist unless your in the basement or second floor dumbass
I just grabbed the hard drive magnet we've had stuck to the side of the fridge for ages and yep it works great. This will be perfect for installing your wife's shoe shelves in my closet.
My house was built in the acid induced 70s there is nothing normal or straight in this house. 1970s tract home. As forest gump said it's as crooked as a politician
this guy likes to hear himself talk.  my god get to the damn point.
Or you could buy a magnetic stud finder and be done with it.
Thank you so much for the help I appreciate it
And for stainless steel screws?
Harbor freight got very powerful magnets though question is that my home was built in the 50's they used in them days lathem plaster no dry wall would this technic still work?
You talk waaaaaaayyyyyyyy too much
Thank you! This is very helpful! I always look forward to your videos!
.....dork.....!
I just drill holes until I hit one, it creates more work for the painter
so the guy puts the pliers on the magnet and shakes the pliers like it's his boyfriend's shlong...very informative
Nicely done. Got more brainy ideas I'm always interested. I mean it, no sarcasm here.
Luckily I was born on Krypton so I just use my x-ray vision. It works every time.
a little block magnet is best, ceramic, dont rust.  just slide it bacmk and forth till you hit the screw/nail.  even work on plaster. though it may not hang by itself on plaster.  $1 at harbor Freight
You spent 2:00 minutes repeating yourself.
My guy!  U are so smart thanks for the tip!
Or... You pick from the plethora of actual stud finders on amazon for under $5.
Thank you!!
I can't stop looking at the gap in his teeth!!!
I tried it with plain old fridge magnets. Got it first try. It might have been luck on my side!
Did you really tell people to probe into an electrical box with a nail? YIKES!
you're awesome.
Simple and yet very effective.  Cheers.
Gee, get to the point guy, I didn't learn the trick, couldn't stand to hear another word
No brain right 🙄👍
Thank you for making this video Keep up the excellent work.
cool trick,,,I metal detect I use my pinpointer to find the nails.works better then a stud finder.
I use my sonic stud finder. 😉
Brilliant life hack!  Old trick or not, was new for me!  Thanks for sharing!
Good job You stretched what should have been a  30 second vid out to over 4 minutes You ramble too much
look look another moron buy a cheap studfinder loser
Brilliant! Thank you.
I found a telescopic magnet works perfect for this job, like this one from Home Depot: https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/p.magnetic-pick-up-tool.1000113788.html
A magnet is a great help for finding needles in haystacks.
Love it!  Thank you!
Smart!
wondering if you could help me... trying to hang some eye bolts from my ceiling and I watched your video and went and got some magnets... I found the "joists" using your method but when I drilled the pilot hole near where the magnet connected I hit nothing but drywall in the ceiling...did this three times and never found the wood/stud...I am incredibly frustrated because the Stanley stud finder isn't working either... any tips? :(
Rub steel wool together close to the wall. The slight magnetism in the screws attracts the tiny metal pieces and you can clearly see all of your studs.
been using magnets for years to find studs.
worked like a charm thanks
wbores are good!
Not as easy as my method. Just darken the room and place a flashlight flush against and shining across the wall. You'll see every stud in the wall. It will highlight every screw. Although the screw heads have been covered and sanded and are invisible they will pop when light is cast across them. Even if the studs are warped and bent you'll be able to see exactly where they are behind th wall.
I had never heard of that trick before. That was awesome!! It saved my husband and I so much time and prevented us from poking holes everywhere in our walls. Now we can mount our TV and finish our project!
This guys is as stupid as he looks, stud finder $10, people poking holes in their walls to find a stud because a diy idiot told them to,,,priceless
genius
Too much talk not enough action
Thanks
Michael Strahan rented out his grill?
puro daldal just doit
what about wood studs???
Wait until you hit a power line . Zap your dead
The magnet i use i can find the studs across the street in my neighbors house.
cool trick, thanks
There is a little stud finder that I have had at least 30 years that has a magnet and pointer that does the same thing only easier.
Nearly 5 mins to say something that should've taken 5 seconds. :/
Ya, this is better. Stud finders are useless...
OMG!  This is going to make my life EASIER !!!  :-):-)
Thanks.
Not sure that will work on wallboard & plaster.
Very good
Works better and cheaper than any stud finder.
Been doing this for years
3:30 into it, he gets to the point.
new to me, great idea. Thanks
Cut to the chase fukin!!!!
Fuckin dork is giving away my secret. I was doing this 5 years ago.
Doesn't work with wooden studs
Um... FYI, DIY: ceilings don't have studs!  Some people can tell by the sound when they knock. But for those who aren't so good at that, why not just buy a STUD/joist FINDER?
Not a bad idea, but a Stanley Stud finder is only a few dollars and the magnet is on a pivot.  When you get close, it starts point to the screw or nail in the wall.  Also depending on the wall, you can just tap with your knuckles and hear the difference where a stud is and where there is hollow wall behind the dry wall.
I'll save you 4 minutes and 44 seconds of your life.  the trick is - magnet.
I think location and age are very important factors here. I'm in New England and we have very old houses and drywall is only on renovated or newer homes (1970s+). Everything else is old horsehair plaster walls. One thing they used to do is put up a metal grate subsurface to lay the plaster on. So between stupid stud finders and magnets and most other methods finding studs is almost impossible except by luck and guess. And a 16" on center in a 1863 house lolololololl.
In my country most studs in old houses are 400mm apart and new houses 600mm apart and made of wood...Magnets dont work
excellent. Thank you!
Totally stupid and absurd. Could hardly understand anything he said. Why is so difficult to speak slowly and clearly?
All the girls line up to find me ;D
talk much?
Thank you for sharing very useful..Keep up the good work..
A bit long winded.  You can buy a magnetic stud finder at Home Depot, I've had one for years.
Dork is the operative word here folks. Zzzzzzz Boring dork...
Get to the point
Cool
This only applies to a smooth ceiling, this didn't work for me with a textured ceiling, maybe my magnet was not strong enough...
I will try it  !
lath and plaster?
Here, just go buy a magnetic stud finder.  https://www.amazon.com/CH-Hanson-03040-Magnetic-Finder/dp/B000IKK0OI
fucking stupid. 1:30 in and all I heard was "check out this new idea".
4:44 to give us :04 of information.
You can also glue one of a small magnet to the end of a piece of string.  Then just swing it (pendulum style) about an inch from the wall. Move it up and down til u get  stick.. Also I use a stud finder and masking tape.Move laterally until lights start up.  Place a 6" piece of tape horizontally where u think stud is.  Repeat scan and mark on the tape where the lights show each side of a stud. That way you know where to hit center of stud.  You can't always trust that the drywall screws are on center.
Nice ! Thanks for sharing
now do a video on how to make and use a water level ?  the old ways always work.
been doing it for years !!! good video !!!  get a yourself a telescoping magnet, extend it and on the ceiling when your close the magnet will pull to the nail/screw, I've seen the magnet even wiggle, slightly away from the surface !!  hope that help's. take care.
great Idea..especially if your studs are made from timber 🙃
Your method does work indeed, and as a Cabinet installer I carried an old speaker magnet for years using the same technique to find studs for installing cabinets in different rooms of a house .  It was strong enough to even hold itself to metal wall studs , when metal was used instead of wood. Still have the magnet, after retiring  over ten years ago ,and worked in the trade for 50 years. Magnets are much stronger now ,but my old speaker magnet still works fine !
Knock on the wall.  You can hear the difference between where a stud is and where it's hollow.
I guess this is a good hack until you are working on a condominium that uses metal studs :))
just buy a stud finder magnet at the hardware store.
that's genius! !  thanks for this simple trick
Excellent idea - thanks.
great energy sir love the video nice idea
Cool method.. Cool tune
I'd be impressed if you found studs in your ceiling.
yep new to me ,,,and ive been in building trade for 30+ yrs,,,brill
I Think there is a thing call " STUD FINDER "  !!!!!!??????
Get to the point.
Thats why the take batteries out if all the the stud finders at home improvement stores so when i walk in they dont all start going off at once
I use old computer hard drive magnets, works a charm and they are really good at keeping my screw drivers magnetised.
You can buy a stud finder at WalMart cheaper than those magnets
well done !
You can buy a stud finder for $10 so why?
half the time any more with the cheapo construction going on these days you can usually look at a wall and find a stud where the wall is not flush or plumb or spot a drywall screw or nail because the finish work is crap. but this idea is great.
thanks for the reply....
great idea? next time can you get straight to the point?
love it ,, but 2 mins. plz;; say it right at the start
My method is easier. I punch the wall with my fist. If I break the drywall then there's no stud. If I break my hand then I found a stud.
Or the free Phone app.....
I drove to the store, bought a Stud Finder, drove home and found a stud in my wall before I realized that this guy drove to the store, bought high strength magnets and tried the same thing.
Sweet!
Neither this nor a studfinder will help finding the studs behind my plaster walls. Thank you anyway.  :~(
they make stud finders for the novices
in a wall hides the nails that hold the frame together. The magnet locates the nail, great idea. On the question of studs and joists is there a framing  build method  for direction the studs lie? North south or east and west?
until the magnet grabs a wire staple and then you still into a wire!!
cool video I sub please check out my page too and maybe sub back thanks
My stud finder keeps pointing at me!
Nice job
the only problem is the fact that the screw or nail will not always be  dead center of the stud.
Skip to 1:56 for the actual method in case you want to skip the inane drivel. Spoiler, nails are metal so just get a rare earth magnet such as a neodymium magnet and wallah, you have a nail finder which is basically the same as a stud finder.
my screws are aluminium does not work
You are on the right track.  This is the best stud finder I've ever used.  https://www.amazon.com/CH-Hanson-03040-Magnetic-Finder/dp/B000IKK0OI
Brilliant!
Studs are not in the ceiling!
just buy a stud finder ,,,,
the magnet will work, but understand modern homes have fire blocking 1/2 way up the wall. pipes and wires are drilled through them. a nail plate is applied to protect them. a nail plate is a steel plate that nail guns cannot penetrate. the plate will attract the magnet.
my husband said "hell yeah" thank you!
Another video that could've been 30 seconds and the guy likes to hear himself talk!!!
Very good.
What about floor joist? My home is about 70 years old if that helps and yes I have a basement.
I sat here for 2 minutes thinking I was gonna get some kind of trick is never knew. oops turns out that's the only way I've ever found a stud
Thanks for the tip.
http://www.acehardware.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1289967
or you can get a stud finder magnet they sell them at the hardware store
YOU'RE A GENIUS
Genious!!!
sooo ill save everyone time, its a Magnet. there.
this video could have been 30 seconds long.. great idea but it took forever for you to get to the point.
Thanks!!!
What about finding joists ?? I need to hang a rod iron pot rack in ceiling. Hope someone can help. Thanks.
This is really helpful.  Thanks.
very good video
WINNER!!! The problem with old tricks are that a lot of them don't get passed on. Thanks for the share.
Much much much to long Zzzzzz
Just plain stupid
Whats up with your teeth.
There are no studs in the ceiling lol.
you just have to measure from the corner, every 16". you dont need all that crap.
its all fun n games till some old lady screws into some live romex. that said see this: http://www.homedepot.com/p/Johnson-Stud-Finder-Plus-160/100212033?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-202563186-_-100212033-_-N
I use a magnet I pulled out of an old hard drive and it works better than most "powerful" magnets you find at the store.
What a neat idea! Thank you!
http://www.homedepot.com/p/C-H-Hanson-Magnetic-Stud-Finder-03040/202563186?cm_mmc=Shopping%7cTHD%7cG%7c0%7cG-BASE-PLA-D25T-HandTools%7c&gclid=CIXm_Lm5htMCFc9gfgodsjAC5Q&gclsrc=aw.ds  I've used these for years. Super powerful magnets. You can hardly pull the damn thing off my tool box.
tie a string to the magnet, then hold it close to the wall, then swing the magnet back and forth against the wall.  If there is a nail near by, you the magnet will stick to the nail.  Probably faster than moving a tiny magnet across a big wall.
magnetic stud finder.. $4.99 at home depot... somebody beat you to it buddy.
this video could have been 45 seconds.
Thank you.
Super idea!  Do I need N52 rare earth magnet or what's the lowest strength I can get for this? Hopefully this will work in my 87yr old building!
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR PLASTER
i have a magnet on a string .if magnet is strong enough it will swing to the screws or box conected to a stud. but not all screws are magnetic
there are no studs in a ceiling
why did you waste 2 minutes talking Bullshit?
no rambling
This thing does what he is doing has a level built into it not as cheap but still cheap enough. Embarrassed a guy with a 600$ bosch stud finder in a house with lathe and plaster walls with it. CH Hanson 03040 Stud 4 Sure Magnetic Stud Finder https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B000IKK0OI/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_jse2ybWAZMMN3
Very good, no need for a stud finder. I don`t have such a magnet on hand so I took a magnet that came  from a microwave oven, broke it to have a lighter piece, put it in a plastic bag for sensitivity: works like a charm. Thanks
Nice.   just like my stud buddy, which I love.   https://youtu.be/hSaTaYIVEI4
What a good ideal, Thanh you so much!
Excellent idea!  Thanks for your efforts to help others with your tips.Best wishes from Scotland.
Brilliant idea... know it's probably not new but great way of presenting it.
Very cool trick, thank you for the information.
Great video!
Brilliant!!!  Thanks so much!
the easiest way to find a stud if you can't find one looking for a nail pop, is to knock on the wall. the wall will sound hollow if there isn't a stud. as you lightly knock on the wall it will have a very solid feel and you will hear the difference in the knock with a stud behind it. Ive never used a stud finder in my life. so either measure of a electric box, look for a nail pop, or simply knock on the wall till you have a solid knock. shouldn't take more than 30 seconds to find one
Everyday is  school day..Ive been plastering for 30 years and never thought of that one ..cheers
That's a great idea!
Get to it less talk
haha this guy is a fuuuuuu. he is trienv to hold on to the hair as long as possible. you go champ, be you good shit. hahaha
This method generally does not work on metal studs OR even horizontal wood studs/braces. So, better than nothing, but can still screw you over.
Im learning all kind of time saving tips on drywall patching and so on today!  thanks for posting!  I love it, cant wait to show my hubby or bro i can do it faster :)
Great idea!
I don't know if that maggot idea is gonna fly.
waaaaaa... that might be easier then a stud finder
nice echo ... could'nt understand a word ....................
You've got some great videos.. new sub
Saved me $30 and a trip to the hardware store because I didn't have to buy a stud finder. Thanks!
never heard of this before.  VERY nice life hack :)
thank you very much
Wow.  4 minutes and 44 seconds to say "use a magnet to find the sheet rock screw and there's your stud.
Thank you. We will try this. It may work better than our purchased studfinder.
Great idea!
Did you listen to your own post?  Please spare us the unintelligible (english?).
same magnet on a string works real good too. swing magnet like pendulum close to wall while moving up n down, side to side,  etc, til magnet sticks to wall. the dowel is a great idea too, especially for finding them in ceiling. a good resource for those magnets are old computer hard drives. they're a bit oddly shaped but can be broken n chipped down to any rough shape.
Thank you for sharing! I struggle to find studs by tapping. (Inconsistent in my knocking.) I've been looking into buying an actual stud finding tool. Do you have a particular one that you recommend?
WOW. This was too easy, Thank you as I need to find them in my ceiling for garage storage.
not every electrical box is mounted to a stud but it's a nice trick. also using a magnet for ceiling joists will only help you find the strapping not the joist, unless the drywall is mounted right to the bottom of the joist with no strapping.
this is super
i do metal detecting and we use pin pointers to find objects works great on studs to find nails.
This is not new but the problem is when you have an old building with lath boards with boards running sideways and fire wals etc. These methods don't work very well in those situations.
Studd finder. problem solved
mounting a new smart TV. no stud finder. measurement after measurement from known stud location by visually seeing and measuring stud at wall receptacle at the bottom of the wall kept showing that that particular stud was deviated by nearly an inch vertically in the wall. i racked my brain knowing i had one good shot at this mount and a 700 dollar mistake i could not risk. you sir deserve a NOBEL PRIZE for preventing the death of husband by strangling.   sincerely, one grateful husband  p.s. rent home nightmare scenerio
Oh Man, This is great!!!!!  I'm a single lady and do lots of projects by myself. I've been trying to figure out how to install a shelf on the wall in my pantry for cans, like soups, sodas, etc. This is going to be SO much help, thank you for posting this video!
AWESOME!!!!
Thanks man!
Thanks so much for the information, you have just saved me countless, frustrating time hunting for a stud, even when using a useless stud finder.
I will stick with the Studfinder or the old knock
Nice video/idea.  I've been using 2 little magnets on a string and swing it. I then place another magnet on the spot that has the nail. (Of course I have dozens of magnets).  (5 cents each when you buy in bulk of a few 100).
The old magnetic type stud finders, a magnet in a small plastic box, used this concept. Presently I use a Pro Finder 5000+ Wall Stud Finder.
Thanks for the vid MrDiyDork.  A question occurred to me when watching; how do you know you're marking the same joist when using this method?  You could very well be marking a nearby joist.  This video assumes that you know which direction the joists run.
love it. works good thanks
Ceilings dont have studs you bozo lol they have joists or truss cords.
If you look close at a wall 90% of the time you will see an indent of a screw.
Brilliant idea, to use magnets!
Too much talking. Just get to the point.
Will not work if you have plaster and lath.
I linked your video to my blog here http://dennybailey.com/hang/nine-tools-everyone-should-own/
this will definetly help! thanx my nicca🤓
There's another thing that can help you get an idea of APPROXIMATELY where the studs are (in the absence of boxes or other visible clues) using your EARS.  No - not to hold the magnet.  Try rapping on the wall with a knuckle and listen to changes in TONE.  Between studs you have a more hollow sound, but as you approach a stud the tone tightens up to indicate the general area where you can start applying your magnet.  Now, on a typical residential 8' wall you should rap above or below the midline (4' above the floor) where there MAY be fire-blocks between the studs, possibly required by some (more anal) building code police.  Cheap, quick, non-destructive, yes; foolproof, painless, no.  Good hint, though, the magnet thing.  For the same money as what you're talking, though, there are still magnetic stud finding tools readily available - Homer sells one made by Johnson that has both magnet and spirit level.  $4
Stud in my CEILING?  I HOPE not!
Oh so simple.
You may find a gas pipe, duct work, medicine chest or other metal objects behind the gypsum board. I use a stud finder or knock.
not for nothing but spending some money for a real stud finder is worth it. it saves you an hr to look for one single nail or screw with the "method" you have for people to use.
You take too long to get to the point of your video.
thats dumb. you can just tap on the wall and find a stud its not that hard. you just listen to the noise. no stud sounds hollow, stud sound like a knock
I like my black n decker stud finder. I think I paid $20 for it 25 years ago. works every time.
I bought a Franklin pro stud finder for 40 dollars. I can find floor joists through 1" thick subfloor. best 40 I have ever spent especially when needing to hang a TV or other heavy objects.
Fantastic!!!
Not to mention, not all boxes are mounted to studs. I've seen switches mounted into cut in boxes.
Yah, ummmm what about lath and horsehair plastered walls?
you dumb fuck....'" It' will even find studs in the ceiling.."  NO IT WON'T, IMMIGRANT...STUDS ARE IN THE WALLS....VERTICAL...OTHER THINGS LIKE JOIST, BOTTOM CORDS OF TRUSSES, PURLIN, BACKING......ARE IN THE CEILING.....so, you won't find "studs " in a ceiling.... Oh, you say, it's just a matter of words, nazi...why so negative....?  Do you call a cow , a goat?  Do you say it's a pickup truck, when it's an SUV ?  Do you say, look, it's raining.....when it's snowing..?   Get my drift?    I didn't think so....you idiot.
i'm an electrician, and the way i did this, go to a computer place ( a small shop) see  if they have some old broken HDD drives,if so buy one ,take it apart and pull out the magnet and use it as your stud finder, there really strong! i used to go to Earl supply and buy them there ,because they would have even stronger mags!  very strong mags!! on finished dry wall ,rap a rag around the mag and no scratches on finished /painted wall .strong mags will work through 1 inch ++ stucco, after  awhile you get the hang of it and you'll do cleaner work and look good!!    Dano   1/25/17    strong mags rule!  it just takes a little time.
Go check out brainless studs they are so cute❤️
It really works :-)))
I use the Magnets out of my old Hard Drives. They're hard core
Handy trick. We use Neo balls. Make a chain, drift them across the wall until you find a nail. Then just take one little neo ball off and leave it there on the wall. Good stuff! 👍
about 25 years ago I bought a magnetic stud finder for a few bucks.  it was very simple, a magnetic rod with a pin in the center encased in clear plastic.  when you got close to a screw, the magnet would point to the screw. you can buy them for about 4 bucks on Amazon https://www.amazon.com/Stanley-47-400-Magnetic-Stud-Finder/dp/B0000BYD3K/ref=sr_1_3?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1485323804&sr=1-3&keywords=magnetic+stud+finder
There are no studs in ceilings
dumbass fuckin clown boy shut the fuck up
No brains required. This guy is living proof. =P
I use the MAGIC STUD FINDER plus .... It's perfect for beginners you can leave the magnets on the wall and find where the stud is from top to bottom  ....it comes with three powerful earth magnets .....at this point of time it's only available at MAGIC STUD FINDER.....as long as the builders who constructed the house were not cheap and put drywall screws down every stud you will never miss a stud ....in California I would just use the red 16 inch method ...but in Spokane Washington where I live now some of my rooms are 24 inches to each stud ...and my ceiling joist are also 24 inches apart
what about older house with plaster walls????
Lol my buddy's an electrician and just showed me this method. Great video!
I have done the same thing. it works
clever
The easiest way is just to knock on your wall. when you hit a stud it sounds solid, if it sounds hollow its not a stud. simple and free
This seems like a lot of hassle just to avoid buying a stud finder, which actually detects the edges of the stud, not just the fastener
I use this all the time as a electrician. I use Neodymium magnets though. Try to get 3/4" x 3/4" or close to it. https://www.amazon.com/AOMAG-38x19mm-Neodymium-Permanent-Magnets/dp/B01FR0BVIM/ref=sr_1_25?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1485130093&sr=1-25&keywords=neodymium+magnets+3%2F4
I was thinking that you might wrap the magnet in a handkerchief to make sure that you didn't get the wall dirty.
Thank you. Correct that. Thank You!!! What a great tip.
What ????. This is the oldest trick in the book.
Great idea man! just one thing, there are some houses where drywall has been glued, very rare. This is a great idea!
genius
Fun.
Are all drywall screws, magnetic
$5 for magnets when a decent stud finder cost that much....
This worked perfectly for me !
Just knock on the wall. If it sounds and feels hollow, you're not on a stud. If it feels solid, you're on a stud. I worked in construction for years and never had problems using that method.
A framing square has a blade & tongue, with lengths of 16" & 24" and widths of 1 1/2" & 2 1/2".  These also are the sizes of rough hewn and nominal lumber as well as typical spacing of framing.  Pro drywall guys check for sqaure, level, and plumb before install$.  With ceilings, framing members are marked at sill plates, wall board is installed with starter nails, marked with chalk-line at center and screwed firmly into place.  With walls, framing members are marked at floor and installed ceiling and again marked with chalk-line at centers.  Thank you to Mr. Joe Gibb, a drywall pro!
You know they actually sell devices called "stud finders". About $20.  Or, if your really good, like me, you just use your knuckle and tap.
Are you kidding??? Basically a stub finder. Thanks Captain Obvious.... not.
Great idea!
that is genius
BRILLIANT!
"Yeah bitch! Magnets!" -- Jesse "Captain Cook" Pinkman  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwVDDxoKBk4
Or just spend $10 for a stud finder ! A whole lot faster ! I've been in remodeling and around construction my whole life. This is not easier or faster. Bottom line.
awesome man, thanks
I use a piece of 000 fine steel wool, when looking for studs on a drywall that has been painted. Crumble the steel wool close to the wall and the screws will appear like magic and show for as long as you need. When done just blow on the screws and they are gone.Your welcome.
thanks,it really helped me.
Good job, I've been doing this for several years.
Have you heard of this new technology called a stud finder? https://www.amazon.com/Zircon-e50-FFP-Edge-Finding-Electronic-Packaging/dp/B01HTFHOEI/ref=sr_1_5?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1484682081&sr=1-5&keywords=stud+finder
What you're here for @ 3:35
i tried it and it did not work and i got one of the strongest magnets.
Stupid! buy a stud finder .
Over two minutes of waffle before you actually start saying something. Downvote.
Dang...  Thank you.  The best ideas are always the simplest.
Amazing idea, wish I had seen your video years ago as it would have saved me tons of work. Thanks
Non construction folk.  Smh. They have been selling magnetic stud finders for years.  Only idiots who push a pencil all day can't figure out where a stud is. Try using you're face to tap on the wall I here that works the best.
that's pretty sweet
They sell stud finders at Home Depot for $5-$10....
Genius!
Why does everybody take forever to get tp the fucking point!?!
skip to 1:55.
I have been using magnets to find studs for 20 years.  Dont always trust this method as there is such a thing as false screws. especially when finding a stud where drywall has been used to cover plaster walls.
a stud finder works better lol relitvly cheap to
Brilliant
Awesome! This method worked the first time I tried it. Thanks so much.
Around here (Metro Boston MA) lots of plaster walls were built with metal lath behind them that would mess up a magnetic approach.  Not everywhere but enough to be a problem. My house for example.   When stuck, what I do is go down to the to edge of the baseboard and drill a series of *tiny* holes on 1 inch spacing. The holes can easily be filled - or just leave them - no one will ever see them.
this type of stud finder has been sold and used for along time already
nice thx!!!
Yeah my dad showed me this years and years ago. It seems so obvious but it's surprising how many people don't know about this, even carpenters. I use a string on mine and I swing the magnet over the wall. It always catches a stud on the first or second swing.
Great idea brother - of course not all of the nails and screws will be made with iron but the majority more than likely will
been using a magnet stud finder fir years, works great
great idea
Genius!  You, sir, win the entire internet!
I used a magnet stud finder 20 yrs ago and they have been out for Alot longer so diy guy not to burst your bubble but contractors, like myself, are not impressed but use it as a comedy show.
dam I thought this was my idea....lol
Get a metal detector.  They have them at harborFreight for $15.  Makes a beep when near a metal fastener.  Works on ceiling or wall.  Circle each place where it beeps and draw a line to define the stud.  Also extends your reach by 12".  Easier than magnets.
Thank you, their cheaper than stud finders
Brilliant! Thank you!
good idea!
I enjoyed your video. Thank you for sharing this great idea. I will share it with my 13 yr. old son. We recently attached a tv mount to his wall and oops! made an extra hole before finding the stud with a stud finder. We will try the magnet idea when mounting his media shelving. I subscribed. You have a great personality for videos!
i have lots of magnets. taped on the wall to find ruffly wear they was and the magnet to pin pouint them. thank you for that help
great idea!! I used my stud finder a few days ago and found it not very accurate.  Do you think attaching a string and swinging the rare earth magnet like a pendulum would work?
like most videos, it's not an improvement or even as good as the standard method (studfinder) it's not quicker, it's not easier then it's pointless. Second off this video is several minutes long but the tip "use a magnet" takes two seconds to explain. it is just so absolutely typical of what waste every single day that I have here all the information that I gain takes hours to get what I could get in just a few seconds I get less information in a week than I should get everyday before I start work because everyone is so ridiculously long-winded. video this long should have a few dozen tips.
GREAT VIDEO THEY SALE A TOOL FOR $10.00 AND IS ALSO A MINI LEVEL...
Nice video, super!
from 3:21
very clever idea
come to the point buddy
But a stud finder. You can get one for 10 bucks . Duh.
my job requires me too locate studs , I just tap my fingers till it feels solid ,works for me , other then that stud finders are not expensive
Great video! This may be a dumb question... but will this also work with ceiling joists?
No substitute for a decent stud finder.  Try to use that magnet to find a fire block in the wall...
I'm Jewish, will this trick work for me?
why don't we buy stub finder?
Great Tip!! I use rare earth magnets for holding sheet music on a metal stand on windy days... just tried this and it works like a charm. Nice deductive reasoning.
Great Idea.  One can also drill a hole in the sheet rock at an angle then insert a close hanger and push it till you find a stud.  Mark the exposed hanger with white out.  Pull it out the wall and then place the white mark that's on the hanger over the hole then go to the end of the hanger and walah that's where the stud is.
Excellent. Thanks. The simplest ideas are usualy the best :)
the ceiling i just worked on was in a garage in the shape of a Pentagon.  i couldn't tell if the joists went east west, north south or north west or south east at the part i was working on. probbbbbably should have just went into the attic above it, but well, you know no one wants to deal with insulation and all that garbage....lol
you came up with that idea all on your own eh? lol
Frigging brilliant
I do handyman work for a living and I keep a rare earth magnet stuck to my Leatherman tool for this exact same reason.
I just look at where the switches and plugs are and knock on the drywall... it's easy to find them...
Never even thought to try this with wooden studs.  Great and simple idea. Thanks.
kool thanx
the eye brows are huge too! wtf? teeth look like chiclets and brows look like caterpillars.
his teeth are like a 3rd grade dance where the girls are on one side and boys in the other side.
good idea, but we have stud finders now.....
on a model house or perfect house the measurement  trick is perfect but dosnt work on 99.9 percent of houses. if one stud is 1/4 inch off they will all be off 1/4 inch. from then on carpenters need skill or speed to keep a job speed is more common unfortunately every stud could be within quarter and inch off and no one will ever notice
Typical American,over thinking and "over engineering" ,all you need to find a stud is at least one good ear and one finger.It never fails,just tapping on the wall,need I explain ?
Stud Buddy on Amazon. Batteries not included. LoL
Sorry, most rockers use glue and just enough screws or nails to hold it. At least that is how they were doing it around here.
great advice, thanks a bunch.
Has this "dork" ever heard of STUD FINDERS?? They are plentiful and cheap. Wow, where does he live?
I love your show I just subscribed that is such a genius simple idea, the best ideas are right in front of you, I think magnets and LEDs can ,save all, solve all problems. I'm going to learn new stuff by watching all your shows Merry Christmas
A lot of yapping get to the point damn!!
I have used magnets for a LONG time.  Using those stud finders you slide around the wall till they beep?  Missed a LOT of studs using that but have very high success rate with a magnet on top of a drywall screw!  Only way to go when you need to find one.
OMG are you for real ? stupid man and stupid video
or you can just buy a stud finder....
yawnnnnnnn
I seen the magnet tool 15 years ago, just looked it up at my near by HD, $3.49
Super! I am about to hang my flat screen TV.  This is really awesome! Thanks so much!
KISS,....is always the best
If you want to know which way your first floor ceiling joists run look which way your floor joists run by looking in your basement. Your ceiling joists will run the opposite way 90% of the time. I've seen some older capes run the same way but it's rare
Did you know when working on the fly that the average hammer is 16" once you find a stud use your hammer for the next one. Another tip instead of poking a bunch of holes for ceiling joists. Poke one and bend a hanger in different intervals till you hit one. The hanger trick is really useful for deep objects in walls and ceilings. Bend the hanger at the size box, or vent or whatever your doing bend in half stick in wall and spin if you don't hit anything it's safe to cut your hole. Stud finders find nails or screws but miss say a pvc pipe and finding that after you cut your hole can be a nightmare.
Buddy, I really appreciate this video – it has helped me a lot but I have a suggestion for you: you speak way too fast and the echoing obscures your words at times
awesome!
Hey dumbfuck... stop being cheap and spend 16 bucks on a stud finder.
you wouldn't need this tip to find the spaces between his teeth.
Nice idea!  Thanks for sharing.
ingenious...... thank you
Electronic stud finders work great, but if you're too cheap, or don't have time to go buy one, why bother going to the store & spending money on the magnets?  Tearing apart any old hard drive from a computer will yield one or two very strong (if not so nicely shaped) neodymium magnets for 0$.  Hack on!
Great video sometimes the best things in life are the simplest best stud finding video. Thanks
Looking at your drywall job behind you it looks like you need more drywall screws? 6 inch separation for borders 12 inch centers.
what if there is a timber stud?
Nice!
Tear apart an old computer hard drive for "free" Neodymium magnets
For me, I use my eyes to find studs everywhere. 😊
4:44 min. You could have done this video in 40 sec, You talk to much.
U don't know there's a stud there, yur assuming the drywaller found the center of the stud after a hard nite of partying-u found the screw, that's all.
Yes, definitely the best method yet.  I've been using neodymium magnets to find studs in the walls for years now.  I bought a pack of 10 small neodymium magnets at Harbor Freight for a few bucks.  I have just about given up on electronic stud finders.  most of them are junk and the repeatability for them is lousy.  The magnets get you right over the drywall fastener (screw or nail) every time.
Or, you can go to lowes or home depot and buy a magnet with a pointer that is used to find studs.  This was the method used before stud fingers. The advantage of a store bought magnet stud finder is that if pin points the nail/screw.
Magnets are the best method I have found yet.  I use a magnet with a hole in it hanging from a string but otherwise same thing.
Excellent idea! I love it!  👍🏼
thank you sir. it helped me.
Stud finders don't work well in old houses because of plaster boards register as studs.Maybe this magnet trick would work.Ill try it on my next project.Thanks.
Have you heard of CH Hanson's ? They've made these magnetic stud finders for decades. I paid six dollars for this on amazon: http://chhanson.com/layoutStud.html The magnet is so strong, it actually pulled a nailhead-sized chip of paint off the wall
Good technique, but holy crap.  This video only needed to be 60-90 seconds.
A good stud finder but the magnet works also I have had some thicker texture to where the magnet is weak picking it up.  It is good to have methods that knocking is an art to find the stud.  I see a lot of 24 inch centers.
i like that ... thanks..
Thank you!  I was worried about using our old stud finder.  This looks much more reliable!
That interior wasn't  the 5 thousand cabin shown from the outside.
This video could have been easily  edited down to 20 to 30 seconds.
3min 45 before he gets round to telling you how !
Just get up off your cheap ass and buy a stud finder instead of all that screwing around with magnets and guessing.
no magic stud finders are cheap and been around for decades
Amazing!  And you don't tear up your walls with holes from hammering a finish nail to locate a stud.   Thank you!
That's great if you have metal studs, but, my old house is 100% wood! Also, not every screw or bolt that is in a wood stud is in the wood solidly. I can't tell you the number of nails I've found in damaged drywall, attics, garages, etc, that are barely on the wood at all! So, if your magnet finds the broken nail, you might hammer a new nail into a dead space. The sonic stud finders are the best way to go, short of using the "knock-knock" method.
Use a Door  Wreath magnet (the kind women use to hang decorative  Wreaths on their exterior & interior doors say at Christmas or whenever)  Find stud Done ..This type of magnet is REALLY POWERFUL.
why not tape a string to the magnet and drag it across the wall?
my magnet sticks anywhere on my walls.....
I've used this technique for a long time. It works great on dry wall. Less than great on lath and plaster walls. This is what I use: http://www.chhanson.com/layoutStud.html
maybe we build house differently here (new zealand) but we glue the centers of the sheets and screw the edges so there would be no screws for the magnet to find on the studs on the walls..... how about you buy a stud finder and circulate it between yourself and your friends........ keeps costs down
This is genius trick to find a stud.
Although I like the rare earth magnet better, I found stud nails via a fidge magnet on a string (taped or glued.) The string provided an indication due to the sensitivity of the swing. With a rare earth magnet on a string, you could cover an large area faster.
they've been selling  magnetic stud finders for 40 years at hardware stores, it's nothing new.  I've got one 30 years old, still works, cost like $3.  they have a needle that pivots back and forth so you can get it directly on the nail head, and a v in it for marking the spot with a pencil.
Starts at 3:16
I use an old hard drive magnet attached to a piece of string. I swing the magnet back and forth and raise and lower the string and the magnet usually jumps right to the screws.
Took 3:24 to get to the meat of the matter. Verbose to say the least.
stud finders work great... and they are cheap
Cool idea
Good advice. Thank you for posting.
Great tip.  Thank you.
Good technique for drywall but probably won't work with an old lath & plaster wall since the metal lath is a sheet of ferric metal the entire surface of the wall.
if you wanna find a stud just knock on my door
Genius...
12bucks and you have this little thing called a stud finder....you get my vote for the dumbest video ever...
try buying a studfinder?  Duhhh
Totally excellent. Thank you.
I've been using this trick for years, and I actually thought of it on my own. I'm sure I didn't invent it of course.
you Frickin genius ,i have to find a couple of joists in my toilet ceiling ,I already poked holes in it to find it ,but this will work perfectly thanks man
ever hear of a stud finder?
C.H. Hanson Magnetic Stud Finder
i spent $30 on a stud finder, and cannot find the studs in a 1910 house . where the wall are plaster\lath. the finder keeps giving false readings says "here is the stud" and there is no stud
This guy is trying to reinvent the wheel. Stud finders have been around for a long time.
wow had not heard of this trick. Thanks helped me on some old 50's cement type board.
FAIL. A magnetic stud finder costs less than $2. For $10 more you can get an electronic one.
use are nuts . lightly tap thd wall or roof with a hammer the sound will change when it finds timber ive use this for years on site
I thought of this when I was wearing nappies... errr sorrrry ..,; dipers
Real cool
A neat idea, but unfortunately for me, I found AFTER moving in that the drywall was fitted by plasterers using the "quick" way: Throw a ball of plaster on the wall, wherever you like, as much as you like, then press the drywall on to it. You find 'dabs' all over the place, at random positions, various 'clearance' between the wall and drywall, and a right BITCH to run cable behind.
nice gap in your front teeth.  Consider an  adult orthodontist.
To save you time he uses a magnet.
Face for Radio!!!!!
I love it! Great idea. THANK YOU.
In case you can't seem to find anything, consider someone was using aluminium screws...
What could have taken 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
Kinda long winded to show such a quick hack. Could have been done in a 30 second video.
This is even better: https://amzn.com/B000AQSCOU  No batteries, and it finds the wood, not the screws, and will never false report pipes, wires or conduit.  You can determine the exact location of the stud down to the millimeter.  Only drawback is tiny pinholes through the paint.  Similar to your nail method, but better, and it has a magnet, just in case.
Tap the wall with your knuckle. You can hear where the stud is by the change in pitch of the taps when you are over a stud.
They make these devices called stud finders.
Good stuff. This reminded me of a really slick way to pull wire through finished wall spaces using  magnets, thanks.
this is neat   thanks
How is this a trick?  The method has been in use for eons.
Get yourself a stud finder , it even tells you if theirs cable behind the wall before you put a nail through it . No magnets required.
That is actually a GREAT idea!
Why not just use x-ray vision?
Awesome yet so simple.
ironically enough this is how most electronic studfinders work as well
or  buy a stud finder they are roughly the same price as that magnet he bought at hobby lobby.. lol considering their prices are  a joke
What about wood studs?
my ceiling has a thick popcorn texture.
Thank you so much for sharing. You just saved me a trip to the hardware store. Great tip.
fuck buds you need braces
Magnetic stud finder's. $10 on Amazon.  My 10yr old can use it.
studs will be 16 inches or 24 inches oc if not you need to move your house was built by morons
I'm an idiot for not thinking of this, gonna make my job a little easier, thanks. An electrician
Good vid. Thanks
get to the fuckin point
studs in the ceiling are called joists
If you want to save money, just tap the wall, you can hear the hollow spots between studs.  Cheap stud finders are only $3-$10.  I get the quick & dirty, but for all that trouble, unless you happen to have a magnet lying around, just buy a stud finder.  Otherwise, tap the wall near a light switch, then measure out.
1:00 - You shifted your front door to the very centre of the house? That doesn't sound very practical - how is anyone going to get in out out?
Great beats the battery stud finder tool units that are inconsistent
If you tape the magnet to a divining rod set up, you can track studs that way...The rod will bend to the nail (good for ceilings)...
A 1/4" .50 cent neodymium magnet will work fine.
I just tie a string to an Earth magnet.
I use  2 neodeum magnets with  a thread  sandwiched between them  and  dangle it....  This  way  it  snaps to  the  point and  if  the  mud is  excessive or any other reason is  just way more  sensitive and  effective......  Works awesome
Here's an idea, pick up a stud finder for 10 bucks, learn how to operate and find your studs.  Why build a stud finder when you can buy one for next to nothing.
a good electronic stud sensor uses material density to find stubs, mine has never let me down and finds each edge of the stud
Instead of putting the magnet into a stick, I would glue it to the end of a string. As you move the string along the wall, as soon as you come anywhere near a screw, the magnet will pull the string out of line.
this is so obvious i cant believe i never thought of it. thanks!
get on with it wow!!
You the man..!!! ..thanks dude
sandwich a piece of string between two magnets. dangle the magnet close to the wall and the screw will grab the magnet. lot easier than a dowel or a piece of wood.
Put the magnet on a string and let the magnet find the screws by holding the string against the wall letting the magnet pendulum until a screw attracts it.
Took you 4 min to tell us to use a "magnet" to find the nails. Should of just gown and bought a stud finder.
Tye an 18 inch string to the magnet and hang it and the magnet will find its way to the head of the screw. Try it. It works.
Maybe on the wall studs you tape a piece of string to your magnet then you go across your wall might be a lil easier just a thought.
I've been doing the same thing for a long time. I'm a industrial electrician and do some commercial work and using a torpedo level with strong magnetic works great especially on metal studs.
Nice ☺ Thanks 👍
Do you think this can accidently find water tuning as well and be mistaken as a nail? Or an electrical tube? Never tried this so I'm just wondering
4:00 is the start of the tutorial in a 4:44 video
I have been doing this for a long time.  I recommend using a small pencil mark to indicate the nail placements.  If you are particular, once you find one, then continue vertically towards both ceiling and floor, and moving slightly from side to side without deviating more than 4 inches.  Afterwards, hold a taunt plumb line or just a chalk sign near the ceiling and against the wall --or as high up as the wall space you are working on.  Move it horizontally across the located nails within one vertical line.  Eyeball the nail marks in relation to the hanging line so that locations are djstributed between the line.  Because across the wall every 4 feet, (usually) two pieces of wall board are butted up against each other at the center of the stud.  These will have nails placed alternately on either side of the center of the stud.  Likely, the center can be found fairly accurately  using a plumb line/chalk line, as was just mentioned.     Another quick method is to glue the small magnet to the end of a string or piece of yarn for if you have a magnet with a hole in it , you can tie it on.  Then hold the string against the wall, with the magnet dangling.  Set the magnet into a very slow and low arc pendulum motion.  If you are slow enough with the swing, and if the magnet is brushing against the wall, it should be attracted to the studs.
You earned a freakin' sub.
this is so dorky...
you screw the edges and glue the middle ,there should be no screws down the length of the stud.
3 minutes to explain a one minute idea.
Way to waste 3 minutes on useless garbage. Try this use a magnet to find the metal screws or metal studs
mr iy dork you are awesome!!     rock on !!!!
Awesome sauce Thanks for the tip!
A very good idea.
I have a Levitt house STUDS,first you'd have to find one straight wall.I think the carpenters were drunk when they built this house.LOL
easy to find the stud providing a decent builder has put the wall in place correctly.
They've been making magnets specifically for this purpose for a long time, I got one about 15 years ago. It's a shame this method isn't more well known, so many homeowners spending the money on a stud finder just to hang one picture. I've seen these ones they got now called studpop, they're pretty nifty the way they work - you'd have to look it up to see what I mean. The drawback is getting into older homes where the drywall was installed with aluminum nails that the magnet won't find. A lot of old school crews still like to use nails to this day, so if you get a magnet and it won't stick anywhere - that's probably why.
i believe you have good idea..   but super long intro..  :-/
I just "knock" on the wall & listen to the difference in tone,... Lower tone means hollow (no stud) & a higher pitch means a stud is behind the plaster or dry wall  ;) Never let me down :)
Why use ten words when two thousand sound better, 😆get to the point quicker mr
I must be the only person on youtube that can hear the difference when I knock on a wall it with my knuckles.
Haha been doing this forever
This idea is old as hell. We been doing this for many years
Will NOT work for lath & plaster walls!
Cool idea. I actually already knew about. Learned it from a video where a guy used powerful magnets to fish wiring inside the wall. He used one of them on a string to find where the studs were. Shaking it back and forth until it sticks is a good and fast method
I can find a stud in less than 2 seconds. That's 4:42 quicker than your video. By the time I watch your video I could have found every stud in the house and the house next door and had a coffee between houses.
Not sure how construction is elsewhere but here in Texas we have ceiling rafters on 24" and non load bearing walls on single story on 24" too  and using magnet is best way to go , no batteries to run down and as for center well in you need to u can drive small nail to find center of stud  . I use both electronic stud finder or magnet  if it's handy. good article .
Great video DIY Dork. Just found your channel and I have subscribed.  Keep up all the awesome help
great
As a retired tradesman (Sparky) all I ever used to find a stud, was to tap on the wall with my knuckle. Too easy on plasterboard...
One down fall with that method is that the screw or nail is not always dead  Center on the stud & not always 16" on center due to stud warping.
thank you Mr. you hit it on the nail.
Brilliant, as far as I remember magnet was one of my favorite toys, hobby work, tool, you name it, and still is, but I never taught about using magnet to find stud, I just learned one more useful way to use the magnet phenomena.
how about old plaster walls?
This is the best! I can't believe this isn't a more well-known trick!  I've been in construction and maintenance for 15 years and I've been banging my dang fist on walls to find studs.  I hope you get a billion likes!
That is such a smart idea I'm going to try that👍
In regards to ceilings, here in Massachusetts the builders have a useful trick of nailing furring strips - 1x2's- to the underside of the joists.  They nail these perpendicular to the joists for strength.  Once the drywall is screwed to the furring strips but before the insulation fills the bays it makes the electrician's job super easy slipping wires under the joists.  It also allows the electricians to maintain the joist's integrity by not having to drill wire egress-holes through load-bearing joists.  The net result of this, though, is that the drywall screws now run at right angles to the joists.  You may never know this until you cut a hole for a light can into the middle of what you think is an empty bay - and run right into the stud 3/4 inch above the drywall!
I am  in    A  world   Of   Shit
Does it work for plaster and lathe walls?
Kinda brings back memories of when I hung my dry-wall. I however, did not go with the 16" on center; it sounds like you might have wanted to hand your drywall horizontally and not on the vertically. I wanted to tie my drywall to more studs. Great tip btw!
Your fast and clear explanations are about the best I've seen in all YT. Narrate all the others, will you please?
This is a great Idea,  I have have tried to use modern stud finders but they don't work on my house for some reason. I think its because of my insulation it has some sort of heavy foil backing on it. My modern stud finder works fine on other newer houses. Thanks so much for the video. Has any one out there have this same problem with there new modern stud finder?
Oh wow!! This would have came in handy a few weeks ago!!
Please can you speak a little slower.  Remember you are in an empty room and what ever you say echoes and when you go too fast, it becomes very difficult to understand what you are saying.
Great idea
Good, But what if the nail just barely hit the stud. For heavy objects, I still like to use a thin nail to pinpoint the exact center.
Awesome, dude.
They've sold magnet stud finders for decades!
I use a studfinder pretty cheep and the longest part of finding  the stud is opening the package. The deep sensing type work on sheet rock and plaster.
My grandpa was a bit of carpenter, and one of the tools in his arsenal from the 60's was a bar magnet on a swivel. You run the device over a wall, and when it gets near a nail or screw, the magnet swivels to "point" at it. Works with a relatively weak magnet because the swivel takes very little force to move.
An even quicker way to find the stud is to hang that magnet from a string couple feet long and then just dangle it along the wall, it'll draw you right to it.
I hang ceiling track used to assist caregivers and family members lift disabled people in their homes. Dozens of them a year..even big X Y Gantry's. I have at my disposal three high end stud finders. Some ceilings they just do not work on. Especially if the builder used 3/8" plywood on the joist before attaching the ceiling. What I go to when that happens is my grandfathers stud finder which I use to keep as a keepsake. It is a black plastic box with a clear plastic top. Inside is a rod that has a magnet on one end. The rod rotates on a pin and when you hit a nail or a screw...you will see the rod tilt towards it. It is a simple tool and really effective. It never misses! Search Magnetic Stud Finder and you will see one.
No magnets needed!  just knock on the wall. When it sounds hallow there is no stud. When it sounds solid there is a stud. Mark spots that sound solid and measure distance between marks to find stud spacing
can you do a more in depth video on this diy hack?
would this work on 100 year old walls/ceilings?  my house was built in 1910.
Thanks, most pleasant !
what's wrong with buying a stud finder? Not that expensive.
Good tip, thanks.
I needed to locate the angled metal bracing behind a wall that was vibrating, this idea would have worked a treat.
You can knock horizontally on dry wall and find the stud too. When you knock on a stud, it's a tighter sound and you can drill holes to find the edge of the stud. Also a screw in the wall doesn't necessarily mean that a stud is present. a newbie could've been working that day and totally missed it. A screw isn't always in the middle of the stud either. With all of this comment space wasted forget the magnet, save yourself the grief and buy a stud finder. With the amount of effort put forth to purchase magnets and embed in sticks, a stud finder would've would have been more proactive. smh....
If no one has mentioned this just do a search for magnetic stud finder. They still sell them and you can probably find them at hardware stores today. Back in the day these cheap plastic devices were all we had and they worked fine.  Or use the rare earth magnet as explained here. Stanley 47-400  is an example of one.
good tip dude
You hardly thought of this. My dad was using magnets back in the 50's........but thanks for sharing. If you hang the magnet(I use hard-drive magnets) on a string you can swing it back and forth to cover more area quicker.
This isn't new, I've had a magnetic stud finder for the last 15 years or more. Simple tool, a magnet on a pivot, pivot moves, stud found.
brilliant
Brilliant idea. Thank you.
You should have started your video at 3:20. You talk far too much.
I like that concept, time consuming but it beats drilling little holes in the wall
in therory stud finders are supposed to work the same way. they use magnets right?
You came up with this?   No offense but this is used for years and years now.  Preferred over  lousy stud finders
Modern stud finders actually tell you where the edges of the studs are. I'll stick to those.
Old school but still works great.Just a side note,ceilings are generally 24" centers.If you can not find 16"in your ceiling pull 24".
useless info
Works great. Unless you have plaster walls.
Good idea!
old carpenters use the magnet attached to a string, the pendulum effect aids in finding the nail or screw head.
Now we use something called a Stud finder. Press a button, drag, beep... lolsssss
Magnets from old speakers or microwave oven magnetrons. Most gyprock is glued and not screwed. The knocking on the wall method is far better and quicker. I use it many times every day.
He finally got to the point half way through the video... but not hate to him! I love this idea!
just cut a big o hole to find the stud :)
Most likely you are not going to find ceiling joists but instead strapping which runs perpendicular to the joists. Not so good for hanging heavy objects from
Haven't you seen these? Good thinking though  https://www.walmart.com/ip/CH-Hanson-03040-Magnetic-Stud-Finder-Compact-Unit-Level-Pack-Of-6/35332761?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=335&adid=22222222227023421025&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=51811786031&wl4=pla-83215601351&wl5=9031567&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=111830463&wl11=online&wl12=35332761&wl13=&veh=sem
I've been using a mag stud finder for a while now. Love them  https://www.amazon.com/CH-Hanson-03040-Magnetic-Finder/dp/B000IKK0OI/ref=sr_1_5?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1477002940&sr=1-5&keywords=stud+finder
Wow! I've been doing this sort of work for longer than I care to admit.Tried all kind of stud finders to no reliable result. Thanks for the info. Wish I had thought of this years ago.....
What do you do when the drywall is glued on??
Excellent idea. Thank you. I have a big heavy mirror to hang. But it must go in a stud.
U know they have a mechanical stud finder that can buy that has a swinging magnet just like what you made.  I have one myself.  Its on a hinge device in center and moves side to side as you slide it and sticks to the nail head just like what you show.
the easiest way EVER: run a light across the wall/ceiling... this will expose the nails/screws. as EVERY patch job is imperfect and exposed by light.
Why don't you just buy a MAGNETIC STUD FINDER?????????????? They're only a couple bucks and work better than that.
You people ever hear of a stud finder?
some chick was looking for a stud and found me...
My studs are not evenly placed either, but I also found empty beer cans inside my walls.   I'm the only straight up even stud in my house anyway. Check out my wife's video on how she found me.
that's fucking genius, thanks
good video... just could be 10x shorter
Oh crap! Good idea.
The gap in his teeth is 16" on center.
We have a brand new house, and code is 16'' on center, but that is not how the framers put up the studs.
what a wonderful idea....so simple...thanks
people who aren't tradesmen shouldn't give advice
Awesome! Thanks for this tip!
Awesome !!
Brilliant!
thanks pugsly
Simply but effective. Thank you for sharing this.
thanks for the knowledge /video
Problem is that you might stick it to a pipe gas, water, sewer then you have a problem.
great fit, my friend has the IP on it and rockler now owns and sells it. The trick is using a strong ball mag. peace.
Thank you for sharing it's a good trick . I'll be looking out for more of your videos. Thanks again .
Longest winded bastard I ever did listen to..
props
Could I knock on the wall with my knuckles and listen for the difference in sound?
This is a great technique.. if you not concerned about getting an accurate center of the stud (which you need to do if mounting something heavy, like a TV wall-mount).  To determine dead center; use this magnet tip, then use a 4-5' piece of straight, coat hanger wire.  Tap the piece of coat hanger into the wall in a few places, either side of the magnet, to "map" the outside edges of the the stud, then find the center.  These very small holes from the coat hanger will fill in with a dab of paint.
Or! Add a string and a weight of some sort to your rig and start at the top.
When you did your board and batten ceiling, did you install over the old popcorn, or remove the popcorn before hand?
theres an even easyer way.. rent a nukular submarine aim it at the wall ya want hit the ping button.. walla
My entire house is aluminum.... Geeeez, go figure
go to harbor freight and buy a Red Devil
Thanks for the info!
awesome dude absolutely awesome
Dude. All you need is a stiff wire about 24 to 30 inches long.  Thenpunch a hole in the drywall to push the wire through the hole into the cavity until you hit a stud.
Great idea. I hadn't thought of that. Thank you for the vid. You're a Great American.
or you could be a big dumb jewface goof
Duh! y didn't I think of that...lol. thanks
I just watched my son do this with a part finder magnet from my tool box works great!
Uuuuuuuughhhh!!!!  That's such a good idea!!!
Perfect! I need to use this for  closet shelving right now.  Tanks halot!
Great idea. Thanks.
I have a stud finder.......my wife.
You could simply buy a stud finer for $10 and it works great. It will show you both edges of the stud if you desire.
Awesome......
perfect
Won't work on wire lath plaster walls, good idea otherwise
I"m going to try this!!  Matter of fact, I'm gonna knock a section of drywall out, just so I can double check it.  HUH!!  Can't wait.
cool video. keep it up!
As I was watching this video I slowly turned to my left and looked at a dozen pdf files that I have stuck to my office wall with rare earth magnets. They have plastic handles and look like a push pin. I have used a z shape coat hanger piece with a small hole in drywall, rotated until it hit a stud. Pulled out the coat hanger and set at same angle to where it hit the stud.
That is the oldest trick in the book!
Don't waste your time with this complicated method. Stud finder on ebay for $5 will allow you to do it like the pros.
Nice.  However, If you don"t have a magnet handy, and you're willing to accept one small hole in the wall:  1] start a small hole (about the size of a nail). "Drill" in at about 45dg, not straight in (i.e. But "parallel" to the floor) 2] get some stiff wire (e.g. A straightened out clothes-hanger) and run the wire in the wall until you feel the stud. You now know how far the stud is from the hole.  Mark the position of the stud. 3] if your wall is at standard 16in centers, you're basically done. 4] if not, start back at the original hole, but go make another hole at 45dg in the other direction. Repeat running in the wire.   You should now know the spacing between the studs.
This did not help me find handsome men. 3/10
Only if someone can would invent stud finders.  Take note Stanley!!
you talk too much.
Easiest method is just knocking and listening.  Nothing to buy or search for.
Or buy a magnetic stud finder. Cost about $3
Let us know how the magnet finds glue....................
if you don't have a magnet,, take a piece of wire . bend it into a shape of a( Z ) leaving the end that goes in the wall or ceiling 8" long for 16" center studs or 12" for 24" studs. after inserting  the 8 or 12 " end in the wall or ceiling turn it one way or  another and when it stops there is the stud. only one hole and no magnets. close hangers are great and you'll only need to make one for that carpenters tool box.
he spent 5 bucks on a magnet and bored out a small piece of a branch to attach the magnet to...i drove to a hardware store and bought a stud finder for 3 bucks
Just tap the wall with your finger.  You can tell where the studs are by the subtle changes in sound that it makes.
how about finding studs on outside Wall where it already has been stucco any tricks for that
Brilliant!
great idea slowdown  explaining your thoughts.
Next to get to work , he will reinvent the wheel.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stud_finder
Silly goose... This will only work on drywall hung with screws or shank nails. However... it will not work with the majority of plaster walls. Just knock on the wall... the studs make a much more solid thud noise compared to the empty space.
i just got a $10 stud finder ....
to much talking on YouTube
I better way is to use an auto mechanics magnetic bolt retriever. It telescopes in length like a car antenna and you just lightly twirl it close to the wall until you feel the magnet pull. I've been doing it for years and it works great. Same theory as this video.
Thank you. Works better then a stud finder.
I think an electronic stud finder should be in every home owners tool box.
how about buying a stud finder..........,
or by a 10 dollar stud finder while your looking for your stupid magnets dumbass.
Great idea using the magnet...  To narrow your search for ceiling joists (to help find a starting point) use a bright flashlight and shine it across the ceiling surface; holding the butt end of flashlight at one wall where the wall meets the ceiling, and shine it towards the opposite side of the room (across the ceiling). Most drywall sags between the joists because of its weight so you'll see shadows in a pattern across the ceiling where the joists are. Helps if the room is dimly lit or dark. When you see the joists, then use your magnet idea to narrow it down to the center of each joist.
This is for cheap sheetrock walls, I have the old mortar plaster over wood lathe walls.
Or.....you can buy a magnetic stud finder that has been available for years and only costs a few bucks.
gosh I feel so stupid after spending $70 on advanced stud finder ---ugh
great....... my screws came out of the studs and the sheet rock fell to the floor!!
Or you can skip everything said and buy a stud finder!
I use neobium magnets that I get off of Ebay. Use one that has a hole in the middle, put a cable tie through it and hen you move it along the wall it'll jump to the nearest screw. Also, hang one around your neck, place a handful of screws on it and you won't have to keep leaning down to pick screws up you just take one off the magnet each time.. This is ideal if you're putting up dry wall.
Stanley 47-400 Magnetic Stud Finder Amazon for under 4 dollars with free shipping  seen these over 20 years ago and yep "why didn't I think of that"
Don't talk so fast. Why do you talk so fast. Imagine an English as a second language viewer listening to your knowledge. Lol
That was awesome.
ceilings dont have studs
God, why didn't I find this video 2 weeks ago????
Tape a thread or light string to the magnet and let it swing back and forth like a pendulum on the surface of the wall as you move up and down the wall. It will stick suddenly and stop swinging when it finds a screw or nail.
Great idea for the DIY individual but on a job site where time is critical I use my handy cow magnet. More area can be covered quickly.
Let me save you some time. Magnets. You're welcome.
I use my magnetic (earth magnets) torpedo level to do the same thing, another method I use when I don't have my level with me is the flashlight dark room method. Put the flashlight against the wall with the lights off and use my trained eye to look for small circular impressions. You see when the mudder throws a lil bit of mud on the screw it shrinks ever so little, and with the flashlight it would create a shadow.
Now this easy and common sense thing idea is something that every home owner & renter is likely to encounter. FANTASTIC! Thanks for coming up with the idea before I did because who knows when that was going to be? I have 2 stud finders. They are also reliable after I confirm it but I never feel confident until I recognize the feeling of a screw actually going through wood. And I have missed the stud many times after using both stud finders having sent a screw right on the edge of the stud. I haven't even used your magnet idea but I can see that it will be sooooo much easier & faster. Ok, now where is that like button . . . . . . .
It's only 16 inch on center in the celing if there is a floor (second story house and multiple story house) above, otherwise it will be 24 inch on center.
Been doing this for many years... harvested some great rare earth magnets out of old computer harddrives, stacked them 10 high, crazy strong!  Other trades always tried to find a flaw in using this technique, but always worked a charm for me.  In modern buildings with this you can even find the steel studs themselves.  Just be aware, what else might attract the magnet: - metal pipes for gas and water  - electrical boxes - duct sheet metal
this is what an old stud finder actually was. it was a small plastic case with a magnet on a pivot
Genius!
https://www.amazon.com/CH-Hanson-03040-Magnetic-Finder/dp/B000IKK0OI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476555060&sr=8-1&keywords=magnetic+stud+finder ive been using it for years. i will never go back to an electric one
Who cares how old this trick is , not everyone has seen everything, its always new knowledge to someone.
all you need is the magnet.. that's all.
That's why there's a magnet on a torpedo level.
super clever!
you are so behind  the  times! !!!!
or you can download an app from Google play
you saved my day, sir!
EXCELLENT…..
How do you find the center? Are the screws always centered?
I never thought of that. Genius.
could have shown that in about 15 seconds instead of a 5 minute video...
Computer hard drives contain larger rare earth magnets.
Thx for the video . Would u kindly be able to help this question ? I was told I do not need anchors if I can screw into the studs https://youtu.be/wdk5M5ugiSA
awesome!
Will that rare earth magnet trick work on an exterior ceiling with stucco?
we used to do this with "cow magnets", sold in farm and feed stores, or any type of store where you can buy stuff for cows.  Cylindrical magnets about the size of a long bullet.  I guess farmers feed them to their cows to swallow, and the magnet goes through their digestive track and "grabs" any metal fragments that the cow may have eaten, and helps pass the metal through the cow easier.  Anyway, they are super strong magnets, and dirt cheap!
Clever
this is a great video, thank you. I have used all kinds of electronic stud finders over the years and they're virtually useless- you cannot beat the old-school magnet trick and this is a spectacular presentation of the technique.
best stud finder tip ever.. thank you!
DUDE you are a genius! i was having trouble finding studs until i used a telescoping magnet(for digging stuff i drop in my car motor). It worked like a charm! Now can you help me find my car keys....?
have you ever used a stud finder?
Nice guy. Appreciate the effort made on this video. Giving a thumbs up but... this video is WAAAAY too long! Minute and a half material tops. I was in a hurry and had to jump through just to get past the build up. Anyway, thank you!
Great tip, many thanks
Super !
Thank you for sharing your knowledge. In Europe drywalls are often made of gypsum board. Some people use wooden studs but professionals use special metal profiles. These are magnetic too. The gypsum board is connect to these profiles with special screws which are also magnetic. When the wall is not painted yet the screws are still visible the metal studs of course not anymore. Stronger magnets should be able to find these hidden studs as the boards are only 12.5 mm thick. The only problem is, that these "studs" are very thin and weak and nearly for sure not strong enough to hang anything on it. For that purpose wooden studs are much more appropriate but they have the disadvantage that wood works and the drywall can "crack".
finding studs? why not use stud finder?
Thanks a lot. Simple and efficient.
I am so happy to say that I was able to use just a regular kitchen magnet! You saved me so much time! Thank you!!
Your trick on finding the studs with a magnet was AWESOME!!!  Thanks so much!!!
How about get to the point instead of telling boring stories without any informational value. should be a 30 second video.
Oh my gawd - you totally rock!  I have a strong magnet for baby safety locks, tried it, and it totally worked!!!  I have two stud finders and sometimes they beep and sometimes they don't and they're inconsistent and I'm never really sure if it's the stud or not.  I just cross my fingers.
Thanks again!  :)
Ow my god brilliant idea 😀
This is brilliant Thanks!
Has anyone tried this method against a tile wall?  I'm looking to hang a grab bar in the shower and the walls are all tile.  Stud finder gives me false positives...so its either invest in a better stud finder or try something else.  The wall in the opposing room backs up to the bathroom wall, so I suppose I could find the studs there and measure it out in the bathroom, but jsut looking for some options now.  Thanks!
Mate you're a legend! Kudos! This will help me so much!
You are awesome!  I love your videos!
You're a genius. You know that, right? Thank you, again.
This is a very old trick. The first "stud finder" I ever had was a cylindrical magnet suspended in a plastic tube that would "stand at attention" when it found a drywall screw.
Fantastically simple - thank you for the trick, I have already put it to good use!
Nice! Great job young man. :)
God that is so cool. been messing around with this electronic device for hours ...saw this and the strong magnets just stick to the wall where the screws are...BRILLIANT
NO BRAINER!! not sure why i never thought of this before ! Great post!
Thanks very much. Magnets are a brilliant idea!
it works with magnets! You can take apart an old hard drive, instead of buying them, they all have a set of 2 neodymium magnets.
There's an app on iPhone that uses the magnet in your iPhone and tells you where the screws are.. Blew my mind..
Awesome, saves me from buying yet ANOTHER stud finder that may or may not work.  Brilliant
There's no apostrophe in DORKS.
THANKS so much for this!!!  It's so ingenious I can't believe I didn't think of it myself.  The only problem I find with this method is that you're relying on the fact that the wall installer actually put the screws INTO the stud to begin with! Unfortunately, seems like I had morons install my walls so the screws aren't exactly screwed into the stud....  Regardless, this was great so thank you!
The magnet trick worked. I have a RYOBI for so many years. But for some reason isn't working since we painted the house. I found an wall without the new paint and it worked. But not over the new paint.  Thanks for the trick.
You talking to much get to the point!
Just found out the stud finder is not that cheap and it's not like I'm going to hang things everyday - So, thank you so much for this easy and inexpensive way to find a stud.
Great idea! Thanks!
I came here expecting to find something new, but I've actually been using this method for over 10 years. I picked it up off an older carpenter/local handyman mentor as a teen.
Great idea, Thanks.
Been using magnets to find studs for years. Still bought a stud finder though *L* Good tip, MyDiyDork.
What happens if the magnet you used pulls the nails/screws out of the studs???  j/k - awesome tip - gonna use it tonight to find the studs in my wall so I can hang my new stair hand rail.
very intelligent! great idea, useful practical helpful! thanks!
You're a genius.
Iam about to take apart an old hard drive
Very helpful. Thank you :-)
Thank you for posting this technique. It worked like a charm!
Would ceramic magnets work for this? I haven't been able to find what I'm looking for in regards to the strength of ceramic magnets.
FYI DIY'er when dry-walling, screws are supposed to be every 8-12" in middle of sheet, and 6-8" on seams. Otherwise sheets will be inadequately fastened to studs and could create screw "pops" Due to pressures such as a closing doors, and on ceilings due to the shear weight of the sheet.

This was really helpful thank you.  We ran into an issue that maybe you could help with...there seems to be something rejecting the magnet on where a stud should be...it literally pushes the magnet away.  Is this still a stud or something else?  Of course it's the stud we'd want to use to hang the tv
Hi! I got very enthusiastic as my magnet managed to give me results my stud finder didnt. After I found one, I searched for another underneath and connected the dots. However, when drilling along that line.... Nothing. I dont hit any stud. I even tried close to the screws and am finding very little resistance or none whatsoever. Any idea what this could mean? Could the screws be holding something else than the studs? It seemed perfect and yet Im confused and discouraged again... Help?
YOU are the coolest guy on YOUTUBE!  That was pure genius.  Can I pretend I made it up??? j/k
no offense man but if your going to go buy a magnet just go buy a stud finder
Smart idea. I shall try it,  Joseph
+cpv2010 You would use the magnet to find a fastener, then find more in both directions, mark them with pieces of tape, and look for the fairly evenly spaced joist pattern. You can also add in other clues like the pitch of the ceiling (if it has one), sneak a peek in the attic, use the nail poke trick like I used in my other video, etc.
u r the best
Great method. I'll try it on my parlor ceiling for hanging a big house plant, plus I'll share this video with my kids. Thank you.
Awesome! This is why Youtube exists. Thanks MrDiyDork.
genius! thanks!
Any idea how this works on plaster/lathe walls?
Hi! Thanks for the great video. I'm trying to find a ceiling joist so I can hang something. I used magnet along a "lower" area of the ceiling, and the magnet sticks all along the dropped are. Is that the duct? Should I avoid this area? I wanted to hang something there
Worked great. Didn't have to go buy some fancy magnets though. I used a magnet off a refrigerator bag clipper. Worked great! Thanks for the tip!
Great idea! I just tried it and it worked great.  Thanks for sharing!
One minor issue to consider.  On a lot of newer construction I've found that dry wallers will actually use only a handful of screws to hang the drywall.  They will often use construction adhesive on the studs, then just tack the sheet in a couple places.  I'm not sure the logic, but I think it saves a lot of time, uses fewer screws (which take more time), which means less patching.  So don't be surprised that you don't find screws except at the edge and maybe a couple near the center of the sheet.
A nice handy method!great video!
