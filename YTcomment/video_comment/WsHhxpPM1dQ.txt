How much do you charge for a retouch please and thank you?
Very therapeutic to watch
4 years later, and I just found this video! Thank you for this!! I needed this. I’m about to try again!
How many uses can you get out of a frontal before needing to throw it away? Or for better terms, how many months can you wear it before needing to buy a new one?
We're y get the wig from
Erika, i know this is old but i would love a video explaining why the sides of my lace come up but my middle stays down.
Thank you
Sorry the whit foamy thing u sprayed is wat
Girl you just gained yourself a new subscriber because your method is the only one that worked for me!! Thank you so much for this video!!😊
How long does the wig last with this method?
That is so pretty
What’s the name of the moose love
I just can’t see where I’m going wrong 😩
Amazing 😍😍

What is the name of the mousse for the baby hair?
Why don’t you pluck your parts?
You are the BEST baby hair layer!
Thanks for sharing this great video,    I got the wonderful product from newigstyle..com last month
U the truth ladybug.....
My lace never stays down when I’m using the mouse to mold it down
Ok how do you stop the inch under a full lace?? Because I just got mine installed and my head inches so bad
I’m a small YouTuber and really want people to check out my content, please subscribe 🥺
Thanks for sharing this great video,you are so kind,I love your channel,    I received the wonderful product from newigstyle three days ago
So if my cap pulled back should I just buy a whole new one or could I reuse it?
Still watching these old videos!
Why are the lace wigs so far pulled down on the forehead ?
I’m scared to use mousse on my clients I used the hot to be gel but I see when u use the mouse it melts more I just don’t want the wig to lift
How do you stop the frontal from shedding
Very helpful! Thank you 🙌🏽😘
her voice is so calming
Damn sis you kill every video!!! Great Job Mama
Honestly you don’t get enough credit! I literally learned everything by watching you and NOT spending almost 1000 on a class thank you💕
This look so good
Oh this is a slay slay ‼️👌🏾
So nice!!!!
you went from mentioning other mousse brands in Feb of this year, to having your own brand less than 6 months later. thats what I call growth!!!!
What mouse again
Swoop and install queen hands down 😍
I love the video but I wish you showed how to clean the lace
Ok came out nice
So u would have to reapply every day since u wash ya face. U need glue.
Oh nice
Seriously...who are these people disliking this video????
is this a transparent lace?? im darkskin and im tryna get that melt !
I have been binge watching love your videos new subbie
Sometimes I understand when people dislike a video. My daughter whom I called to watch this told me she liked everything but she didn't like the baby hairs. So, those are the people who might dislike a video just because of one little thing they didn't love about it. Ijs😉
Where can I get Lace Tint from?
Yaasssss! Come thru!
For the 79 people that disliked. YOU SUCK! Slay ErikaJ as usual!!
I followed all your steps, but my lace wasn’t stuck to my sides after applying the mousse.. but it came out great for my first attempt at a frontal/wig
Please start listing the products use down below
I’m trying to understand why the got 2b went up to her forehead . Is it suppose to be like that everytime you apply a lace or just for certain clients ?
How long does it take you to install a lace... because I feel like I take too long????
My lace lifts when I use this moose
where can I find the moose 😩😩😩😩
How can we book you being that you will be back and forth between Savannah and Germany?
What wrapping foams do you use?
Which lace tint do u use ?
Ericka I’m curious how is this a retouch if you have to take the entire wig off and re install. Wouldn’t this just be a regular application? I’m a stylist so I’m curious how to add retouch for my wig services
Watching this was sooooo satisfying!!!!!! This is art
Gurllll you soooo bomb
LAIDDDDD🗣😍😍😍
To PRETTY !!!!
Love it.
This how the FUCK A wig suppose to look
What oil sheen u use
Love Love Love your work....  in your previous videos you would use makeup on the lace and the cap... so should I stop using the makeup on the lace now because you started we should only use makeup on the cap..?
What’s the name of the mousse you use?
I love it
Are you doing hand sewn and machine wigs still or only machine?
Where to buy this adore lace tint? Not on Amazon

We need new music in the back
Please what mousse is she use?
Where can i get the silk wrap that you wrap around the edges from??
I love this look 🥰  What’s the name of the lace tint used ?
Love ur work it turned out so pretty🥰 I learned a new way to do my edges🥰🥰🥰but Quick question if the lace is supposed to look natural why is the wig so far from her natural hair line?
Anybody know the makeup used to fill in part area?
Love it❤️🗣🗣🗣
Since this is a re install , why did you have to cut the baby hair again? Do u have to crest new baby hair each install?
Always slayyyyyy

Hey ! Do you have a video on doing someone’s hair with very fair skin ?
Do you have a suggestion on how to determine which lace tint is best to choose for your skin tone? I loveeeeeee your videos I've learned so much on how to make my own! You are blessed sis!!!
Do you do different braid patterns when doing a closure vs a frontal or do you just do cornrows straight back all the time ?
I love this!
How long does this last without touching up?
Do you prefer the lace tint spray as opposed to makeup or tinting the lace with fabric dye?
Can you help me. I've been using bold hold and I'm following your steps and the glue only last for only a few days. I clean my skin and the lace before I put the glue on... What do you think I'm doing wrong
Im so scared to try using mousse again cause i messed up the first time
I need to film more wigs too but my big problem is my lace is not transparent because it’s mid brown which doesn’t blend with my skin tone
I don’t understand the baby hairs, sorry.
How did you secure the back?
What’s the name of the lace tint and where can I purchase from?
I really struggle with the baby hairs😩😩
How do you feel about bronner bros tropical  foam?

Hello! I have a request☺️ You do such a phenomenal job on your p pieces!

It’s a little difficult sometimes catch the  brand names when you state them during the videos. Thanks so much! See you at the TOP!🌺💐🌺
What were the 3 mousse that you said to use that don’t lift the lace? Apogee and what?
Yes hunty slay...Greatest re-install I've seen 🙌
Are the back of these wigs secured down? Or is it just the front?? No one ever shows how the back is secured so it doesn’t flip up.
Flawless per usual 😍😍
