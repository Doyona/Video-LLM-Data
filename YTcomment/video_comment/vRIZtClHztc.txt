Cảm ơn Beth,chị làm lần đầu thành công rất là ngon, chúc sức khỏe Beth nhe
Hi Beth, hôm nay tôi làm theo công thức của Beth nhưng chỉ lấy một nửa thôi. Tất cả chia đôi để có 16 bánh. Nhưng sau khi chiên xong, bánh bị méo mó, bột mềm mà không giòn giống Beth làm. Tôi không biết mình sai ở bước nào?. Ăn cũng ok, nhưng không dám khoe với con, nó sẽ nói bánh của mẹ làm bị sao vậy 😢?
The Dough looks good but The Dough is too large size for small family.  Thank you dough! lol!
I dont have the small tub of vanilla, just the square packets. Are they the same amount? Can i just use that?
🤤🤤🤤 #SesameBalls
Hey hi chef 😊
Looks delicious 😋 give me one please 😋
不好意思很想要知道芝麻球配方裡面的材料有那些，可以回答嗎謝謝，我聽不懂英語，
Hi! Is the glutenous rice with wheatgluten? I have wheat intolerance, and wonder if it contains wheatgluten, and if it is possible to cut the glutenous rice?😊 Looks wonderful, and thank you for the detailed video
Your so articulate and awesome with regards to your recipe tutorial ❤
Parler angkajs je ne comprends rien du tout
I like 👍
The first time you make it, start in the morning it may take a couple hours . I'm making it right now 2nd time.  My family in law is Viet and they said this was very very good. Right now I'm at 1 1/2 hours and finished the dough and filling ☺️
Thanks for sharing Beth.
Beth kitchen Where can i buy the Pastry Mat like your ?
Look deliicious👍
Love this recipe. Thank you
Hello sisters
Nhờ chị Beth xinh gái hướng dẫn bí quyết khoai tây giúp khi chiên bánh , bánh không nổ đì đùng phỏng mặt mũi . Nguyện xin Thiên Chúa đời sau trả công cho chị . Quê tôi kiếp trước tại North Star . Vậy rồi đây  nếu có duyên thì gặp lại . Cảm ơn .
Wow, I grew up near a bakery where you could get these and the ones you make look just like the ones I bought and LOVED as a kid. I can't wait to try making them! 🥰❤💯
So I tried this recipe and after many years of fail attempts with other recipes, this recipe worked! My dough was a little dry, so I find wetting your hands while rolling the dough with the mung bean help. Spraying it with water as Beth did is probably helpful too, I didn't have any seseme seeds to roll it in. I also find that keeping the oil at medium heat to help the balls cook to 10-12 mins without getting too dark help the balls to expand.

Thank you Beth for your wonderful recipe.  Would you please send me the link to get the stay-in thermometer?
Hi, what can substitute cooked potato?
Hi Beth, can I use potato flakes instead of potato. Can I put the sesame balls the freezer and fry later. Thank you!!
Hi Beth, can I use potato flakes instead bake potato?
I tried this recipe and turn out super good, my family love this. Thanks so much Beth for sharing the recipe. I miss your new recipe.

Cảm ơn! ❤️ Mẹ and I are making it this weekend. I was surprised when I saw you hold it in your hand because I usually see them in a smaller size! They’re huge!
I've been trying different recipe, but this one is the best. Oil was not splashing, the Sesame ball was not broken. I used low Med heat. Thank you for the recipe.
I love this recipe. Thank you for translating it. I will make this for sure.

Excellent vid. 👍👏 You have the best instrument compared to others on how to wraps. U make it so round n perfect same size. Mine wasn’t in the fryer for 5min and it burns already. Lower the heat took it out and it deflated rite after? 😟😣😖 Not as easy as it looks. 🤭🤔
Hi Beth, I will follow you step by step, however just have one question, is it ok if I reduce the amount ingredients as I don’t want to make that many ? Thanks!
Bột nếp là bao nhiêu vậy cô
Hi chị, nếu em làm cỡ 10 cái bánh thì lượng bột thế nào? Nhà em chỉ có 2 vợ chồng nên sợ làm nhiều ăn ko hết.  And potato mình mua loại nào vậy chị?
Has anyone tried freezing the unfried balls? I only want to fry a few but wonder if it would freeze well and fry well after being frozen.
Easy to understand , let me try , thanks a lot

Thanks

I already tried this recipe it’s work out Thanks for your recipe👍
Beth, tks for the awesome recipe. I just made it today for the 2nd time. Cut down sugar to 200 g instead of 215 g. Yielded 46 balls. Taste so good. I’ve tried your other recipe, Thai’s Snack Crispy Flower Cookies too. Preparing for the next recipe - Crispy Waffle Rolls & Vietnamese Hollow Donuts.
Ok these sesame seed balls are so amazing I'm just in love with them but I could never figure out what's the inside of the ones I purchase at the Asian market, I don't know If you have any idea. When I open it, it's a smaller ball of paste,  but the taste is amazing and it looks a bit green, it doesn't stick to the sesame ball like the red bean filling I have seen on other videos.
I'm so excited to find this video! I used to get these from a small Asian market when I was a kid but could never find the type with the sweet ball in the center after I moved. Only with red bean paste or cheese. Thank you!
What is the amount of the small tube of vanilla sugar?
Omg looks too beautiful to eat! I love them sesame balls and would love to make some one day!
These are delicious! Thank you so much for this recipe, I hope to try it someday. A local market makes these and I didn't even know what they were called. How amazing! Thanks again very much!
Hi chi Beth, Thank you for sharing your recipe. I'm getting ready to try to make it this weekend. May I ask where did you get the sweetened coconut flakes from? I can only find the one in American grocery by the baking ile but it is dried and short. Thanks for your help chi. I enjoyed your Pateso and banh da lon recipe so much
Hi Beth, cho mình hỏi nếu vo bánh, để tủ lạnh qua đêm rồi sáng mai lăn mè chiên có được ko, vì nhà hay ăn tiệc buổi trưa, nếu để sáng mới làm thì mất nhiều thời gian quá. Thanks.
Very nice receipie
I tried your recipe today. It turned out very good. So much better than other places.
Love your cooking, I like watching every Your videos!
Wow! 👍🏽
looks delicious i wanted to try this recipe
Yummy....... thanks.
Chi Co lam banh tieu Khong?  Fried Sesame donuts

Chị ơi , bánh này chiên xong để đến ngày hôm sau có bi xẹp và còn giòn không vậy chị. Cám ơn chị đã chia sẻ
This is the best recipe. I miss being able to go into Chinatown to buy them. They are the only ones I know
Thank you for these very clear instructions.  Your dough looks perfect!  I'm going to try this recipe.
So easy to follow.  I love them.  thanks for the recipe and how to do it.
Beth, if I dont have coconut flakes can I skip it? And will it mess up the recipe? Thank you?

Thank you for sharing I really love it.
I have been looking for this hollow sesame balls for a long time. I tried many other but not hollow like yours. I'm going to try yours and see how it turns out. Thank you!
I will follow your recipe. I tried once and a lot of them burst. Thank you
What kind of potato did you use?
The first batch, I followed her steps exactly as shown. It took forever!!!  The second time, I did this and it turned out just as tasty, but a lot faster (about 30 minutes total). Below are a few ways to simplify this whole process.  Cook the green been in the rice cooker machine. It takes 1 minute to cut open the bag, put it in the pot, rinse it twice, add some water and press the cook button. Do this whenever you have time or even the day before and keep the green been warm in the pot until you want to use it.  Put the cooked green been (still hot) on a pan, add sugar, salt, oil (I use coconut oil), and some glutinous flour (mix about ¼ cup of water and glutinous flour together, the amount does not have to be exact, you’re trying to make the cooked green been stick together easily), mix it on medium heat, spend 3 to 5 minutes on the cook green been. If it looks like it sticks together and you can form a ball, you’re done.  For the coating, you don’t need to add the mashed potato (that will save you 10 minutes) and corn starch. I did not add it, and the oil didn’t explode as mentioned. Use corn syrup instead of sugar, it will add elastic to the dough and make it easier to work it. The water to be added onto the dough must be very warm to keep the dough warm. It took my kids (5 years old and 3 years old) and I 10 minutes to make 30 balls, and then another 10 minutes to fry all of them at 375 degree F in our deep fryer machine (in two batches). The shape of the ball does not need to be perfectly round, but it must covers all the cooked been stuffing in the middle. It will perfect itself once fried.  The trick is not to make the dough too dry. The dough does not need to rest.  In fact, it’s soft and easy to work with if the dough is still warm. If the dough is not warm, put it in the microwave for 1 minute (depend on the size of the dough) to soften it up.  For your information, I think It tastes better without the mashed potato added.
Goddamit... Can't stop eating Banh Cam... its so addictive
Hi there, can i make and freeze before frying?
I love your video very helpful thanks
One pack of glutinous rice flour equal to how many gram?
I made them yesterday and they turned out great! I went to Vietnam this summer and absolutely loved banh cam. So excited that I can now make them at home as well! Just wish it wouldn't be so time consuming... Still I'm gonna make them again soon
16oz only 453gr but in 1 bag = 500gr
Please confirm potatoes you put in!  Please
Hi Beth! Thanks for adding the english version for all your videos. Makes it alot easier... Love your cooking:))
Hi Beth, is the potato boiled or steamed? Thanks
excellent.
thank you for speaking English. so many Asians know English but few non-asians know whatever dialect you speak. HELPFUL!!
Akun bong la ah naa
its beautiful. u so good!
So this recipe makes 32pcs sesame balls my dear?
Looks yummy 😋
Sao mình làm nó không nổi 😭😭😭
so  good
Thank you i like it
Can I use rice flour only  Because in my country don't have glutinous rice flour
I love the sesame balls. I grew up on the outskirts of China town in Boston and the Sesame balls were filled with plum paste I think. Something pink. We ate till we were sick
Hi Beth, I want to know where did you buy double acting baking powder and I have been looking for over place? I only saw was only single acting baking powder. Thank you
Oh, looks so good! Can I do this glutenfree?
Thank you so much Beth for your wonderful recipe! I made it on sat and it came out perfect.  Even eating it the day after the balls were still soft. I know the crunch isn’t there but all other recipes I’ve tried in the past, the balls get very tough the next day. Will be using this recipe for now on.
Tq so much for the recipe...clear n easy ..
Thank you for the recipe..nice sesame balls..look so good..😍😘😘😘👍👍👍👍

I,   love recipe  for the sesame seed balls thank you,  very clear.
Thanks you for sharing Beth, A dream of mine to know how make the perfect crunchy sesame ball. I wonder how must filling did u scoop out with your ice-cream scoop? How big do we need to flat the dough into a disc, in term of diameter?  Thanks  Kim
Omg thank you so much for the English version. Will definitely make it and will let you know how it goes. God bless you.
