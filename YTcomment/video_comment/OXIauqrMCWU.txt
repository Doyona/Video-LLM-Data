What grade of steel wool for final cleaning? The package is hidden by the oil.
We’re do you get the scraper that match the design of windows
Thank you very much for this great video. I am removing old paint from a 100 year old windows and was wandering how critical is to clean ALL the paint. Its very hard to go between the ridges of the wood and I don't want to sand to deep. I am planning to use raw linseed oil and linseed oil paint.
Any advice or comments about using boiled linseed oil instead of raw linseed oil?
Blimey, if you can  take the sashes  out! Not worth the expense..
what about with lead paint ?
You should have gloves, eye protection, and respirator rated for lead.  You most likely have lead in those windows even though the top coat may be acrylic.
Dough?
Please guys, can we get to know the ingredients of the dough
This looked so cathartic that I want to try to work on my windows again.
Thank you this definitely the most comprehensive and helpful vid on the matter I’ve seen. — but one hang up, why does it “HAVE to be Allback Organic Raw Linseed Oil or it won’t work”?
makes complete sense to use oils and infrared what a brilliant idea
Great guide, thanks. I definitely managed to scorch the wood with the silent paint remover though. I’m not sure if it’s just what I’m working on, the side of the door I’m current working only has a thin layer of paint on it.
عمل ممتاز جداً شكراً لك على المعلومة
Excellent comprehensive video. You did a masterful job. Thank you for the detailed list prior too.
Really well explained . Thank you.
I'm usualy making custom scrapers to fit the profile... for easier scraping interior side .
Great video. Using your strategy/procedure for heating the putting, what is your incidence of cracking panes of glass. Do you prefer the tape or the cardboard? Thanks.
i searched for "windows 10 restoration" and this came up, but forgot the "pc" at the end lol😂
I seached for Windows restorastion.... Windows 10 XD
Tnx for good instructions. Used this on my parents house, 9 windows as tall as a man on the side where the sun hits hardest.
Is there a method of getting the glass out of the lower sash, where the glass is inserted into a kerf in the meeting rail? I've found that this part is very difficult and I've broken several windows trying to remove glass from the lower sash
Does this window contains lead paint ?
Very nice video. I did some repair of the steel lock of the of Historic Window from 1900. Hire is the video https://youtu.be/lJ-I7ZZsnD4
Hello, thank you for this great video. I was wondering if the same technique could be used on interior surfaces to remove varnish or polyurethane from wood. Thanks
Awesome interesting video thanks
Super sejt! Tjek mit projekt her: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFmBhUy1rnw&t=60s
Wow!  thank you.  What a great video.
Intense video. Thank You.
What if you want to stain and varnish the inside? How do you deal with the paint that stayed in the grains?
Thank you, I’m restoring my house and it will help me a lot
Did this to the inside of my basement windows. Two of the windows have a crack in them. Put tape on them for now. New windows aren’t in the budget right now. Doing the outside next.
You really did an amazing job, by far the best window restoration video I have seen.
Great video - terrible scene transition music!
Do you know of any tutorials on using similar products for old overhangs that are caked on with paint? I've been removing it with the Cobra paint remover, but it does not come off anywhere near as well as it seems to come off of your windows. It could be not using Linseed Oil, but I'm not sure if I should use that because I'm not sure if I'll be using Linseed oil paint for the repaint.
Can anyone tell me where I can find 'inorganic' linseed oil!? People using these terms should learn what they actually mean instead of just using popular buzz words.
How do you dispose of the old paint and putty?
I hate to sound all preservationist-like, but often the restoration process is more about keeping and maintaining the old and oftentimes original materials which add to the overall aesthetic of the building. It's not hard to make the argument that newer, factory-made triple-pane windows are more energy efficient. What really matters are your priorities. If you value efficiency and energy cost savings over aesthetics and period details, then go buy yourself a well-made new window. For some folks, putting on a sweater and burning a little more oil is just part of living in an old house. You don't drive an antique car for it's fuel efficiency and reliability; if that's what you want, go buy a new car. But there's something about those old cars...and old houses. Anyway, I'll just keep on trying to convince people not to throw everything in the dumpster. If you must, please call a restoration pro first and have them take 'em off your hands!
A lot of professionals and homeowners all around the world are pretty passionate about savings old wood windows. The Allback family has done an incredible job researching the benefits of wood window restoration, as well as bringing back the Traditional Purified Linseed Oil Products (paints, oils, waxes, etc.). Check out the links below for their incredible story (Hans Allback became sick from using solvents and began looking for healthier, more effective alternatives to modern products), research and case studies (they offer a lot of data on the work they have done at Palace of Versailles and other European estates/projects), and hands-on education on how to use the materials in their Allback Handbook. Earth+Flax is working to create more resources for those interested in the USA. Look out for all the videos soon to come!

GOT  THE  CHISEL............NOW  WHERE  TO  FIND  THE   WHITE  CHALK
WHERE  TO  GET  ROLLER  CHISEL  ??????????????
there's only one good solution for these old windows it's called a bonfire breakdown  and go buy some new windows you morons they'll pay for themselves they're more energy efficient and you don't have to paint them what you're doing just looks like a dumb Hobby restoring old energy-wasting windows
What is the chisel that has the guides on it? Is this a regular chisel that has been modified or the guides attached much like the ones used for stair construction.
This is one of the best and most complete videos I've seen on how to restore a window.  The only thing I do is I drop some water on the pane to cool it down as I am heating/scraping.  It saves the windows from cracking. Also, the silent paint remover will blacken the surface if left too long in one spot.
You can order the roller chisel in the tools section on the silent paint remover site. I just ordered this system and can't wait to get my dirty old windows cleaned up

Be careful of breathing lead while using this method
Do you have to remove the old putty?  If it is solidly attached on the glass, could you not just apply new putty over it?
Where did you get that roller putty remover?? It's not listed or available at any of the sites you have listed. I'm doing 23 windows and that would help so much! Thanks for the great tips! Terri S.
one of the best window restore videos, if not the best.
sanding unnecessary? are you mad?
Are these pretty standard tools? (Scraping tools you use?) I am trying to learn enough to reglaze 15 old windows on our home in Georgia.
Very informative
