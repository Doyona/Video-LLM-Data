I know this is Old, but does anyone Know if this outer lockable can be also be switch locked from inside when i'm home for the night?
I typically search on YouTube before I make a purchase. Came across your video after searching lockable storm door handles. Just wanted to say thank you. Your video made it easy to purchase and install my new handle. Your video was extremely helpful 🙏🏽👍🏽😁
So unprofessional and cute video, love it! 😁  Single mom trying to save some $  Thank you!
Can you please explain the length of the spindle?
So how was it "gunna use these to cut that to size"  I would love to see you do that on your video!
Do you like from the outside with the key are you trying to open from the inside you can write you got to go outside and open it with the key
Great video. Install was easy.   But two days the cylinder fell out the front of the lock.  Any ideas?
You made me smile with your happiness the moment your video began-thank you  :  D
THANK YOU 😊 🙏 😊.  I lost the instructions to the Wright storm door locking storm door handle. It's been a  couple of weeks, and I couldn't figure out how to do the replacement. Excellent instructions (audio & visual). You are my hero!
I have a question...I installed this as a replacement handle...but I didn't cut the spindle because I didn't think it needed to be BUT my door will not lock with the key...and I really need it to..I took it off and put it bad twice...but all I did the second time was turn the lock over so that the flat part was on the bottom... My spindle was even with the door... What did I do wrong....🤦‍♀️
Watched this specifically to see how to cut the metal part and you completely skipped over that part. I hope this is not your main source of income. Your video sucks.
Where did you get that kit? Who makes it?
Thank you so much for this, I was having trouble with those instructions that came with it!
You are hilarious. Thanks for that. Thanks for video. Subscribed!
I know this video is 6 yrs old, but THANK YOU! I’ve been searching YouTube trying to figure out why the key hole won’t stay in the push button part of the handle, but the 3:00 mark in your video was the solution - I had to rotate it with the key 🤦🏻‍♀️. WTF tho! Been searching for this solution since yesterday and had to fast forward thru 100 videos to get to the door latch installation part on all of them and yours was the only one that mentioned this. You’d think Larson would have included it in their instructions but they didn’t and I calling them was no help - they said return it to lowes for another one, but the whole door is already installed without an issue. I appreciate your time and effort uploading this video. Thank you again!
As a single mom I’ve had to learn to do things on my own. I depend on good explanations on a video. Yours was very helpful. Thank you!
Thank you, Just finished putting up my lock. Thanks for the video. 💯💫
Part about cutting down the metal 👌 I thought my metal rod was just too long 👍😂
Thank you for this video. We were able to finally figure out how to install the key-latch replacement. Good job!
Can't get the spring to push button out.. any tips
thanks you showed me why i couldnt put mines on
Do u have a link where to buy this lock ?
2021-06-30 - Never mind the comment.  There is an arrow on the metal piece you put on the outside of the door and that will tell you where to break this off. This is trial by error.  Take the last one off, see if it fits, if so done. If not take the next one off and continue the process until you are finished. It does work but you need a little patience.
Nice video but you forgot how to determine how much of the spindle to break off.  Is this trial and error?  The instructions on the unit were not very clear either.
Thank You for the video
Still a good video
Don’t need the bad humor!!!!
How about you get on with it and skip the lecture on your sweater
Ion like how u skip it
THANK YOU!!!
Gracias  me ayudó. Mucho y.  Si pude arreglarlo  thanks again. Very good  video.
I love you
The screw doesn’t fit my screen, but that’s for the visual! Following just the paper was a little unclear
I watched this video to see how you made your cut on the spindle.  You showed absolutely nothing.  Thumbs down.
Dumb ass music at the beginning.
Thanks man. For one I could not figure the lock part out but now a breeze.
WHAT makes you think you should be making these videos??  You are SO bad at this!  Your instructions are a bad as your recording! Please just go back to whatever you were doing before making these ridiculously useless videos!!
forgot  to replace Scews in your head ! Stop the POT !
installed handel but when i unlocked it with key the whole lock came out?
