Stumbled across this a week or 2 ago (I know--where have I been???).  SUPER tutorial.  Just having a little trouble catching up with the products and brushes you're  using, so writing those into a comment or something like that would help tremendously.  FABULOUS teacher!
Thank you 🙏

I like the first method (it's the only part I've watched-_-)
Thank you.  I really enjoy your videos.
Hahaha what happened at 3:30 🤣
I know nothing about concealers. This man just showed how easy it is...but I still can't and will not do this. Maybe, soon....
this is great! thank you
Wayne is a real down-to-earth person who really cares!!
I tried them all and I found the one that works for me! Thank you Wayne!

Hi, I'm from Brazil and I love your vision on makeup. I have a difficult skin and I'm never able to aplly foundation to make it flawless. I was wondering if I can sent you some pictures of my face so you can give me advice that will actually work for me. Thanks a lot!
you have to be gay lol putting makeup on. yeah you are....
I totally love all your videos. 😍😍😍
I don't care im watching this in 2018
He was a lil bit nervous..that's cute :)
Hello, this process appears to be too difficult, there's a quite simple way. Go to google and search: "Blast4beauty". Here you can find easy tips which will be very easy for you to implement.
You truly are inspiring in your work I truly just yesterday went to Bobby Brown to make an appointment to get the right shade for my under eye as it’s so dark now I realize it was the way I was placing the concealer this has  been a difficult area for me 4 so many years !! After watching your video am so inspired thank you 😊 on a side note losing your concentration happens to the best off us !! It’s the mind 😂🙈 try counting cash and then for one sec I think off dinner tonight lol thanks again ❤️
What brand is this consealer ? Love your makeup tutorials :)
I love how he barely edits ❤
YOU CAN GET EYE SURGERY ON TOP AND LOWER LIDS SIMPLE PROCEDURE CHEAP TOO
Do you know that is EXACTLY what I say EVERY time I look in the mirror and try to apply make-up !! L.O.L.
is it necessary to put eye primer before makeup?  answer please
Love Love
3.29 ??
u rub too hard! u r a guy, i like women showing best
What if you have large pores there at the very top of the cheeks - right where you're swabbing with the sponge?
Does make your eyelid sticky? I will have to try. I have a ton of concealer and I am getting lines around my eyes. So afraid it will make me look worse!
com
Can you do an updated video with foundation on pleeaasseee
Ekdum mast video
Perché non lo fate pure in italiano
Love your videos! Love you Wayne!!!
“Obviously if you’re using a powder foundation makes more sense to use a power concealer especially if you’re doing it... umm.. you know... sort of... fu****”                                           —Wayne Goss
Ok, question for you Goss. Concealer before or after foundation. (I'm using MAC studio fix liquid and MAC liquid concealer?
Whas's your favorite aplication??
Love your 4th way
Hi Wayne, thanks for such a good demo, you said the ugly word and looked ashamed, you're not used to talk like that on camera, so what you're not perfect, we're not either, all of we are humans
Love that blooper!! Your awesome!
Seems a damp qtip would wipe it off
Thanks so much for that helpful tip
never would be thought of lightly spritzing my brush with water it blended in great in your video:):)
Powder concealer ? 😃👍👍👍👍 I do use that,(powder foundation)
Love this guy and his videos!
Great video
lol love it
3:30 😂😂😂
Love Wayne ❤
Lol you're cute when you get frustrated
Man did I need this tutorial. I have never really been into makeup - just the minimum, but at age 38 I thought I should add eye concealer to my routine.  MAC girl matched me with Studio Finish concealer and Skinfinish Mineralize compact for my t zone. She suggested that I apply it with your "beauty school" method. However I like your first technique. Anyhow, I think she suggested the wrong brush. She sold me 215, and now on videos I see many using 217 or that orange hair concealer brush. Can anyone help me or suggest what brush I should be using?  Thank you.
Id  rather  see  people  being  REAL....instead of  TRYING  to  be  sooooo  perfect!!
3:35 the face you make when you accidentally fart in class
Which pallette are u using plz mention brand
What does a concealer do? I never use it
I like the first technique better
thank you
Watching this after watching your video about getting veneers... and omg I totally forgot about this intro!! Nostalgia! 😂
i know this sounds stupid but can you use concealer without foundation?
Why Don't Boys Wear Makeup 😔
Honestly I am confused, my shirt does not have a tag or anything to show the front or back of it and I don't know whether my shirt is on backwards. Felt like sharing.
Who makes this concealer?
I usually used concealer on daily makeup, and used it with my favorite brush from here ✩→ https://mobile.twitter.com/katielosss/status/862861181668564993 It was matched with the concealer and eyeshadow that I wear
What brand of concealer palette did you use here?
as always great video thanxxxx
fuck him lmao😂😂😂
Wtf? I expected A girl or something not A friggin guy!
And what was that,fucking?????Whenever I see your face,I can't control my laugh
You are the most beautiful girl in this world.
3:31. LMFAO! Great Video, BTW. Really helped me, I used the first method, but with a buffing brush, because I wanted to get that type of 'no makeup' makeup look; so I wanted it to look realistic.  Thanks Mr. Goss. Zxx
Are you supposed to put on concealer before or after using liquid foundation?
GREAT!! You are the best!!
What happen to him on 3:27 😂😂😂😂😂
Wayne! I tried the 1st technique today and it IS beautiful. I have mature skin but it still went on beautifully, Thank You!
😂
Fab thanks Wayne

Well demonstrated 😉
What for to apply the councilor on top of the foundation... To highlight?
Thank you for sharing these techniques I have very severe dark under eyes ( hereditary as well as from thyroid problems) & have never been able to cover them completely I've always thought that the triangle was how the only way yet still didn't work and left more of a shadow of darkness no matter how much I used and blended I truly appreciate all your helpful tips I can't wait to try each of these Will you please do a tutorial for dark under eyes that are sunken in with the loose aging skin with wrinkles PLEASE I've just subscribed Finally found someone to learn techniques from who is honest and explains the process while actually doing it unlike most tutorials on here Thank you
Gracias muy bueno y sencillo. 💕👍👌👏
hey wayne. I have really dark under eyes and whatever i do i cannot cover them . I use sponges and mac pro long wear.
you are the most handsome man in the world. omg !!!!!!
Thumbs up for mentioning women of colour with the colour correctors :)
You just saved my life! I found this soooo usefull! Thank you, you're truly amazing
Just great I thought you was going to apply the concealed ion the model but you was actually doing it on your self " wonderful "
I'm kind of new to makeup.  I was wondering if it is OK to only wear concealer under the eyes without any foundation on?
Those concealers can be frustrating as fck sometimes.
Hahahhaa ! Damn you Wayne Goss. I love your videos even-though im a total noob when it comes to makeup and getting around to find the perfect shade for concealer and what colours to use at which parts and how to blend it all in. Yeah, like some of us, im still kinda amused when you said ' fucken ' out of the random blue. :D
Coco H...Curious as to why u laugh, everytime u see him? I must be missing something. I see a nice man, offering good, professional advice, to all of us, trying to look our best. I love a good laugh. So, will u please share, what u find so amusing.
So helpful, thank you!
Thank you so much! Just started using concealer and this really helped me out.
Hi Goss! I absolutely love your videos and you've taught me so much in the past few months. I have a question for you about a different way of applying concealer that you didn't list.  I learned from a Brazilian makeup artist. She applies concealer before foundation and just a little bit afterwards to finalize the look. What do you think about that? I use Matchmaster foundation and Pro-Long Wear concealer, both by MAC. Thanks
Hey Wayne, that q tip way to apply concealer has literally changed my life. Thank you!
Hahahaha 3:35 😘
Does he recommend apply concelear near to lash line? I cant catch what he said about it
I love you - just because!  Ty for all the great videos - your awesome.
This is hands-down the only concealer tutorial I've seen on YT that's easy and simple. I never would've thought of using a stippling brush but that's why you're a makeup artist and I'm a pharmacy student 😉
I am new to makeup. I have some dark circles under my eye's that I want to take care of. Good to know that applying concealer is pretty simple. I suspect that will have to play with it. But it hopefully won't take long to get it right. Thanks for the video.
😉
I love all of your vid. It's very easy to understand specially a dummy like me. hehhe
3:35 😂😂😂🔫
Dear Wayne... You are so hard wih yourself... Don't be so rude to yourself, please. You deserve love and kindness, that's all. Be kind with yourself. Thank you for sharing love and passion for beauty in all its dimensions. Thank you. <3
LMAO @ blooper, that was hilarious!!
well my concealer match's my skin tone and i use it all over,should i have a lighter shade for under the eye coverage?
greattt... smarrttt...
I used the damp brush way this morning. It worked, thanks.
Thank you!
I always learn so much from your videos
Excellent presentation.  However,  I am of the opinion that the success of any make-up application is the brush -- "it's all about the brush..."  Thanks Kasey McGowan for giving us the link to the concealer collection now, does anyone have any good tips for decent brushes?  Thank you.
What brand concealers are you using.
Absolutely love your videos! I so thankful I ran across one and now I'm hooked! Btw my makeup has never looked better thanks to your tips & instructions. Thanks!
did anyone catch what brand of concealer be it's using?
corridos VIP
What happened there at around 3:35?
You forgot to edit at minute 3:30 lol
Try ice massage for under eye bags ,It gives n amazing result and preps the skin nicely for the concealer.
Anyone knows if he has snapchat? Would be fun to follow him around in snapchat.
He was awesome
Thanks,  love you always!
Most artist try the products on themselves to get a feel for a new product.
I love you
Great make up artist but demo on your own face?
When you did the first method, was that brush also sprayed with water?
Why is he wearing makeup😕
Love this tutorial! I learned so much!
Omg that was an awkward pissed off pause Hahahah. Still a great video and tips ;)
oops!
loved it
Thank you for your advices :)
He is awesome like a beauty adviser! fucking good! 😆
you look so hot... 😍
Damn you're handsome
even so you still have an amazing smile:) love your tutorials thank you for sharing love yuh!
the best makeup artist
Been a great help to a newbie like myself, cheers!
Buff
ok so..I liked that you didn't edit out the mini stumble :') you're human, and you're real, and you're showing us that. and nobody is perfect. and you've shown some bloody good courage through your tutorials and videos, so many people wouldn't and don't have the courage or confidence to do this. but thousands of people are glad you do! your videos are so helpful and informative. don't get annoyed about the stumbles, they're nothing :) they don't matter. you're ok :) love the tutorials and tips
OMG! He forgot to edit! THIS IS MY FAVORITE VIDEO SO FAR!!!
i just used my concealer with a spray of water & I have to admitt that it goes on much better ! thanks!
Wayne  you are a brilliant makeup artist. I don't think a women could do the great job you do and understand what are faces goes through like a man does. I love your video's. Connie
which is better liquid concealer or cream?
Never gets boring!! You are fantastic!!!
i would love to know what happened at 3:31 O.O im amused and scared at the same time O.o
Wayne,your the best...love your videos....Please come visit Ireland soon.
thank you for sharing your experience I really enjoy and have learn .hope everything is good I felt a little of sadness just want to let you now everything will be OK hope you the best keep up the great work.
I know now how to conceal under eye bags but how do I  conceal the rest of the areas around the eye, or just do the eye bags?
lol priceless
Does it clog pores?
Is he wearing pyjamas?  Lol.  Love his tutorials
Fucken.. Hahaha that was cute tho
Fukken..... xD Priceless Great tutorial. can you suggest a good affordable stippling brush! my sleek one is on its last legs and for now id like a cheap one to do me until i can afford a nice one for myself  I do have quite a good few gorgeous ones but i use those on my clients and though i UV oven clean them i still just dont like the thought of using those on myself! <3 thank you Goss xx
In method one could you use Giorgio Armani Master Corrector in that way?  Also would you do this method before applying your foundation?
So funny when he just froze after he said it 🙊😋
Great.. but if you wear contacts brushing your whole eye is out of the question,you have to be careful not to get concealer on contacts
So glad to have found this tutorial. I'm new to concealer and this really helps. Would be great to see you apply this technique to a woman of color for further help.
Wayne what colour concealer tone is best to cover very dark circles?
This is the most useful tutorial for aplying concealer I´ve ever seen (and the easiest, by the way). It was pretty useful. Thanks a lot for uploading it. :D
What was that????
How can I avoid eye gak/goo/boogers that makeup gives me?
The blooper was cute! LOL... He's the only concealer video I watched completely. Thought it made him seem down to earth.
Do men really where consealer
Oh God, that was funny. Watching him get flustered!! hilarious. I love you Wayne Goss!
wth
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!
OMG! Thank you for this. Excellent video for a beginner like me
lmao he instantly got upset
i am only 11
Thank you Wayne. this was a really helpful tutorial. I meant to ask you, since I am a beginner in concealer and not even an amateur in make up generally, can I use method one with liquid concealer? Or even with the second method? Thanks!
LOLOL He's human! He's fuckin' human!
The "fucken" part was surprising....I hope no one was giving you a hard time....your videos are awsome! You explain very well and your face is georgous by the way! Take care xo
YASSS ! Lmao Had to watch again and again. It did look like something was distracting him. And the way he tried to keep his composure... took a deep breath...awkward but hilarious.
Awesome video. TFS. I have a quick question. I have the KO palette from RCMA. How do you know which color(s) to use for a concealer? Without having to play with all of them because I don't see a lot of difference between some of the lighter colors. I have the skin coloring of Salma Hayek and it's been a rather frustrating experience. I bought them upon your recommendation and I LOVE them. Thank you so much. :)
Can someone tell me what is the brand of the pallette he is using? Thx!
Thanks again for the great ideas. I love stealing them from you..ha...And as always, you are adorable!
DONT like if you're watching this in 2015
Hah, LOVE the "Fucking..FUCK" part! Sexy shit! Grr!
I  found the f@ck part amazing ! You were sooooo sweet ! Really love that part !
I just find you! I am learning now at 40 something to apply makeup correctly. You have taught me a lot in 5 tutorials. I am an Afro American women that would only look at women of the same, in tutorials. Well I can't say that they have helped me better than you. You have helped me greatly! Thank you!
Hey I have just a little christian can somebody send me a link or tell me how to use concealer right as a man cuz I have talked to her circles under my eyes and I want to change it so I look more fresh thank you
Call me crazy if you want but, I repeated the video from around 3:28 a few times and he seems to be saying " f*ck him", not "f*ckin". Also he looks as if he is looking at his phone or something off to the side. Maybe he got a message during the video from someone he was angry at? Idk. Just my thoughts.  What does everyone else think?
I find this extremely useful.. Thank you!
Thank you so much for the techniques they helped alot you're one helpful guy thankyou keep making great videoss :D
What a doll and he is good!!!
gosh! tthis guy is way better than most makeup ''teacher'' girls that i have ever followed. i'm really learning from this guy!
Newer to your channel, your videos are so helpful. I just love that you didn't edit out your f bomb by the way! 💕

lol... I love this guy..
Can u tel me the name of the brand of concealer pallet
that was a really helpful video, thanks!
whats the concaler label ? thanks
Im a guy, and my under eye area isnt too noticeable, but with my foundation/ concealer on me it stands out a bit more than usual, but i like it. I think it gives that sexy tortured look.
I love that you included the blooper; it made me feel like i was connecting to your message. Great tips. thanks a lot :-)
whyyy would you do it with yourself! get a model!!
thank you so much for your teaching:)really like useing your mathods:)
I love this. It really helped me alot. Thank you
Thanks for making this video... I got some ideas how to use concealer...
I loved the fucken part!  lol.
Thank u
I would LOVE for you to do my make up!!
great vid!! always so much to learn from you :)) What happened at about 3;28 though? It was like you got possessed or something. it was weird.
Lol he forgot to edit the fucken part when he messed up. Hahah
Hi I was wondering if you could do a video to show how to use concler to cover unwanted redness like mild rosacea?
Love yew boo. Thanks again for sharing! :)
I'm also wondering what happened at 3:30 lol
Thx
great video! I'm still getting into makeup but I learnt so much in less than 10 mins, nice one :) x
THX lots i love the way you teach… ;)
hey, ive been looking into using concealer to cover my scars left from acne mainly on my cheeks, do i need to use foundation afterwards or is that not a must cause i just want to cover my scars not start wearing lots of make up and so on? anyone who can help ill be grateful.. cheers :)
I just LOVE this video, as well as all your others ones, they are so informative and you explain it so well how to do it. Thanks :D
perfect video :) the water sprey is real water?or product ?
can u pls tell me what's the spray??
Almost 2 million subbies...AWESOME!
thank you for sharing this tutorial, i didn't know there are so many different ways to apply my concealer heh
using the right toner will help you get your concealer not chalky after applying it and it will blend well into your skin looking all natural!
whats the difference between a concealer and corrector?
Not bad I've been looking for a video to show how to apply concealer the properly way. I'm still new to concealer lol your video is helpful ☺️☺️
did u just say "fuck him" on a tutorial???
Yet another outstanding video!
oh lawd he should have edited that before posting it.
loveee that u give tips for woc
does anyone know which palettes are used in the video?
He is adorablee <3 :)
Why is he doing it
Does anybody know what brush Wayne is using in method 5 please? He really is brilliant!
which brand he's using for the concealer ?
So easy and so effective. His videos are always inspiring.
I absolutely loved the damp sponge and q tip trick. Concealer has been really hard for me to blend out and this has helped me so much. I thank you so much for your videos!
I think the most important is the techinique he teaches, better to learn with a master, I don't care if he is a guy, I focus on the pro tip . When I go to Mac, my dear best seller is a guy and he many times teaches me doing it by my side.
what is the brand of the concealer he's using? i didn't catch the name..
what brand of make up is this???
can anyone tell me what happende when 3.30?
sooo useful 👌
Hey :D great video thanks :) i never used concealer before and i hardly ever use foundation (cause i don't have scars acne or other stuff..)  SO i spent more than two hours watching videos about how to apply concealer and your video is the best !because you're objective !  .. you're showing EVERY WAY possible and you don't make me feel like i need to buy X brushes or X sponges to apply it ;) thanks a lot !
😍 bloooooooopppperr loved it !!!
The #1 method has changed my life omg thank you! !!!!
Can you stop making that noise with your teeth its annoying
Love, love, looovvee!! 😊 thank you!!
your amazing..
I just have to say, LOVE your videos and your personality in them!!!!!!!!  I also LOVE how you kept the raw footage of your blooper mishap. Cracked me up!!!!!!!!! LOVE LOVE how you kept it you.
I cant Belive you make all there vídeos
What happened at 3:30... Lol?
why would a guy want to apply makeup?
Does he make it look easy or what????? Wow!
He doesn't have dark circles so its hard to see how it'll work
im sick and tired of people saying is awkward or weird seing a man showing how to apply make up , get it over !!! yes is a man, yes he does it better than many women and he is teaching us wich is amazing !
you explain better techniques than any of the other makeup youtube accounts! *subscribed*
I got linked here for your before and after teeth...I have been watching your videos for a while and i never even noticed! Now that you point it out though, i can see the difference. You were adorable before AND after but im very happy you arent in pain anymore :)
Great ideas, thank you for shearing it :)
Love you and your videos! Keep up the good work handsome!
how to make the double eyelids ...  ?? :)
He's adorable, and I love all his tutorials, I'm learning so much!  Thank you!  Is there a vid where he talks about and gives names to the products he uses so I can get them?
YOU SAVE SAVED MY LIFE I FINALLY FIND A WAY TO APPLY CONCEALER RIGHT OMG
I have really dark circles but the worst of it is my skin under my eye has so many fine lines from me being rough with my skin. When ever I use a corrector or a concealer it looks so cakey and ashy. Its frustrating.  Can someone help me?
you are adorable! thanks for the tutorial
Goss would you recommend this same methods for over 50?
Really  like  the  way you  did  the  concealer
Its funny when he stopped. And didnt wanna say another word. Its ok. I still love you, and love all your tips!
Ohgawd. That blooper. So funny and adorable :)
This is a little awkward when a guy is doing this tutorial..
NOOOO..... noone wants a Kim K look!
I have tried every stinkin concealer trick, method, color, and nothing works. Once I set it with powder they come right thru. I think I'm good and then bam there they are.
Thank you this really helped!!!
amazing! best makeup videos on youtube
Thank you for the tips
U r amazing dear...sending love from india-:))))) love u ....kisses n hugssss
Hi Goss, what if you're using a liquid foundation, do you still apply the concealer first? If you wet the sponge, won't it move/slide the foundation? I have very oily skin so in my case I moisturize then prime with MOM before applying foundation.
fuck u man ur ballshit
Just tried the stippling technique... Life is changed forever! I'm a believer!
When he said fuck I was like o_o And then I was cracking up xD
Were can I get this pallet I love it
You are seriously one of the best! Luv your work and your personality♡

Wayne, I just tried method #1! I LOVE it! I've had a hard time with my concealers creasing recently. I think it was because I was packing too much on and not blending it out. The stippling brush technique is a god send! THANK YOU!!! <3
Ahahaha when u just smiled and put a hand up and continued as if nothing happened You are the best!
Thx
I use way number 2 with my beauty blender, because I don't where foundation, just concealer
The blooper cracked me up as well. I love your videos. You really give the most useful tips. Thanks!

The one tip for the bags under the eye is number one for me. It has helped me so much. Tired mommy of two.
great tips
Can u do a make up video on some one of colour?
you are cute
Hi, I was wondering whether it is necessary to apply concealer with foundation? Also, do I need to apply on setting powder afterwards?  Is it possible/advisable to apply on concealer on a moisturised face followed by BB cream? Or would that just look weird?
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO A REVIEW ON 'IT COSMETICS BYE BYE UNDER EYE'.  PLEASE PLEASE.  WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS.  MUCH APPRECIATED
love you Goss ! thanks for all your advice
you are the best make up teacher! I am 34 and learned more from you in the last few months than any time in my life  what happened after the blooper :( you looked confused. and why did you not delete it?
I love it when he winks! I feel like he's winking at me, so I wink back! ;)
What do you think about Beautie factory brand conceiler? Is it as good as Mac?
Is your conceiler powder or cream?
What palette are you using?
I love your work!!!
I love your makeup tips. I watch them ever morning. Thanks for helping all,of us look a little better.
the first and 2nd method it is for me the easy one to do it :)
Wow, I really like your tutorials. Like someone here already asked - could you let us all know the brand of concealer you're using? :)
Ha gayyyyy
Very good
I used concealer, then...nothing look different :(
Wait what? Did he just? "Rewinds"....lololol. Too funny
I love his instructions on how to apply and I love the bloopers!! He's a normal person!! LOVE IT!!
Love 1, and 2nd method. Will try the first. I use NC42 studio fix powder on my face but for concelor I use NW35 so it does work out and the yellow corrector. Thanks again for sharing love all your tutorials. Blessings
When was the blooper?
Hi Gloss,.. I like your tutorials, buy I can't always tell what product you are using.  Can you flash the name on the screen please?.. What concealer brand did you say you are using in this video??  Also it was the same in your foundation video... couldn't really hear all the product names.  ****
The blooper was adorable :D
That annoying stage when your best friend (who’s been a loser for a long time, it should be said) gets an unbelievable girl to fall in love with him in like 2 weeks? Yeah, that basically occurred. I understand I ought to think well done, but I wish it was me. He stated he used the Cupid Love System (Search for it in Google). I wanna hide inside of a cave at this moment...
Hahahaha @3.31 you are funny. I love how humble you sound too. You sound lovable
Lmfao @ the mini meltdown, love it.
You don’t need to be young to experience acne. My brother and his kid both had cystic and severe acne. Both had been able to remedy themselves once they came across the Acne Executioner (Google it). Most people will not be as lucky as them.
Anyone know what's the difference is between a concealer and a corrector?
Hello :) It´s clear to me that you have a lot of work and you are busy but I have maybe stupid question but still I´m going to ask, to what and where I apply corector and if I apply first concealer and then corector or how is it? I can make a good make-up on my face but still I´m little bit unsure about this. If I first apply corector, then concealer, when make-up and when powder to look flawless and have a long last make-up? And thank you very much!!
try a moisturizer before you put anything on! i've seen goss do it and it absolutely helps!
The blooper made me laugh out loud. What about setting concealer. I have been trying out Banana powder and my undereye looks dry. Also, were you using the Mac blending brush at the end there ?
Your videos are all so useful....really good coaching and practical usage....Thank you....SmileKids TV
Your so talented!
You are my favorite makeup artist and the blooper was great!
I love the blooper! Gets me every time

You are by far the best beauty guru. You actually give us tips, most people who call themselves "beauty gurus" just do hauls and everyday makeup crap.
Thank you very much! Very interesting!
Lol why did u just stop in the middle
i am literally obsessed with you and that blooper moment made me love you even more! Hands down you're the best teacher/makeupartist/genius on youtube. love love love!
What's the difference of concealer or corrector?
Thankyou!! Xx
Hi amazing tutorial as per usual! I have been using the bobbi brown creamy concealer with my fingers and it looks valet and makes my eyes look dry! Any recommendations on how to apply this specific one or recommend another concealer? Also I have milia with is extremely hard to cover any recommendations for this too?
Doesn't it go in ur eyes n harm ur eyes??
I have the same question as ⏬
I have a question. If I apply a color correcter do I apply the concealer over it? or the foundation after first then the color correcter?
no one complains about the great high end makeup  brands created by men
Thanks for another great tutorial.
Do you have tourettes?
Thx this video will help, I have a problem using concealers, but now I can try one your methods.....Oh and yea.... bloopers...it happens don't worry about it the video had great content!!...
Loved the video, but wasn't quite sure what happened with the "fuck"....had to rewind a couple times to catch what happened. No worries we're all human. Can you recommend a good concealer for dark circles and bags for oily skin?  :)
Lol! Love it!
and wich tone?
I have a really awful dark circles what concealer do you recommend me?
Thanks, I really appreciate your vids on technique/application.
Wow very amazing i just got eye concelar i had no idea thanks
i think you should talk less , when you say blen it down or wtever people cn see it so you dont need to exadurate it .. :)

wait did you say fuck EM
I think I like the brush method much better
yep i agree, this is really fantastic. i can tell you one thing, it's way easier than i thought do a few surveys and boom a few $100 extra in your bank every week. if you wanna try just try now: bit.ly\16uu5JH
Good!!
I really CAN'T put a dislike on this video =)
Hahahaa powdered concealer, extreme editing fail
I'm a beginner with makeup, and I've been watching and learning a lot from your videos lately. Thanks a lot. You are amazing. :)
amazing ! i like what u do :)
Did you know that the guy who was in the latest Jason Bourne movie and played Hawkeye started out as a makeup artist? He's straight, and he says it was a great way to get into auditions.
You're amazing!
Lol! Editing fail
Amazing
Extremely helpful video!
haha, love the blooper :D
Is that a question or a statement?
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA the blooper moment :p

LOL 3:30-335!  I had to rewind a few times to see what happened there ;-)  I LOVE your videos!  You are such a talented makeup artist & you're so fun to watch!  Thank you for doing what you do =)
Wayne are you saying that it's bad that I use a highlighting pen concealer with my powder foundation? I started using makeup about a month or so ago under the advice of my niece and she said nothing about having to use a powder concealer. I've been using the maybelline dream lumi highlighting pen for my dark circles and maybelline purestay powder foundation.
Love your videos  I agree though I am Kim k-ed out. Ugh enough with her
you are so sexy... sometimes i cant focus on cosmetics u show cos i look at your face eyes bla bla. i would like to have housband who looks like u have deep calm voice like yours and act like u .. u are so macho  man with sensitive inside. kisses.
naice
Goss YOU ARE CRAZY MAN!!!!!! Love your tutorials,all of them I needed....
Hes a makeup artist genius

Hi there, have you considered ＡＣＮＥｖｅｒＡｇａｉｎ.ｃｏｍ ? Just copy and  then paste the link and go there. On there you can watch a good free video demonstrating how you can eliminate acne quickly. It made it easier for Kevin to get attractive clean skin and pores within 4-8 weeks. It may work for you as well...
Some of the greatest make up artist are men
I really learned a lot, can't wait to try these techniques! Can I know what the palette was that you were using?
sexist much? i hate evil people like you
Fuck is my ultimate favorite word! And to see you "Fuck Up"! Was hysterical ! Thanks for not editing it out! I loved it! I think all hairdressers and makeup artists use that word the most! Obviously it's the same "across the pond"!.... Too funny! You made my day! P.S.... Do you use corrector for those horrible lines on the neck? I use Graftobian,and Mud cream foundations. Love, love cream foundations ! I have the same ( skin,eye, and hair ) color as you. But, have found that those ugly lines on
That was surely strange, wayne never seen that side of you before?! Please let us kno what happened, amd why u left it in and didnt edit it out.. u looked angry as hek! Or really aggravated a 3 u wayne
lmao at the random "fuck him" where's the backstory/explanation for that lol
Really helpful,I was struggling with how to apply concealer everyday.
whatever it was, I play it during my alone time
Thankyou fr ur effort really helped me.
Did he sware?
Hey, do you know "hairator" yet? Just search on Google. On their website I found a useful and pain-free hair removal alternative which involves no shaving, waxing or other outdated methods. The truth is, that solution has been presented in Time Magazine. It made it possible for Cindy to get long lasting smooth skin. It may help you out as well...
Thank you :)
You make it look easy ^^
<3  When I'm tired and just can't get to bed my first thought is to go online and watch some videos or vlogs, weather it's on my phone or laptop: but unfortunately most are just nonsense.  Yet every time I watch your videos I just keep watching and clicking on new videos and just KEEP watching and take everything in (I even bought some of your requested makeup products) :D please DON"T stop what you're doing for us here on YouTube you're  AMAZING!  XOXO

Can I use concealer on it's own?! Without going over it with foundation?
hmmm, what concealer were used. If I could get the name please. Thanks
Whats ur favorite brushs
I have watched so many of your videos in the last week and I love them,but just realized u never show make up application on a woman..I would like to see that. But I do enjoy watching u apply on yourself as well. I just want to see a womans face before and after with your methods
Wink ;)) i love it!
Amazing tutorial! I've been using concealer forever and this STILL taught me something new! Thank you!! xo
I've watched a gazillion videos with your tutorials.  This is the first one where I was like. ..what?  So funny!  You're the best.  Love your talent and advice.  Most of all, you're so down to Earth.

This is exactly the kind of help I need to modernise my makeup look..wonderful advice,  Thankyou ..and the love /hate relationship you have with the camera ,when it acts up ,is really hilarious.  ;-)
oh.
idk guys these makeup tips didn't make him look like kim kardashian at all :/
why is a man doing it ?  Him before the video... Y O L O
You rule!
Thank you for teaching me the right way to apply and use products. I love watching you because I know that you will teach me. I like to be entertained and that you do well but because you are so passionate, I can hear it in your voice and see it in your eyes and that is what keeps my attention. I have learned so much by watching you. Thank you so much.
3:30 the comments though haha! That it was just me I stopped like..... Wtf was that lmaoo. Great tutorial anyway though!!! Love your vids
Every time i use a product with heavy consistency such as concealer, my dry patches / flaky skin shows up even more - even after I've exfoliated and moisturized! What am I doing wrong? :-(
Lovely
Love watching your vis You sir are fantastic!
u re so so so so so coool!! I loved all of ur video! Super love u. LOL Thank u so much!! :)
What type of brush is that, is it for the foundation?
kinda wished to see each individual method by itself...and not directly over each other. =\ but informative video nonetheless.
Plz the name of the pallet.i loove it.u r so helpful with that video man
you make it look so easy!
3:30 was a weird moment. It seemed like a Torettes moment or a possessed moment or something....I hope not cos I really do love you!!
Oops, is it me or was a blooper left in? Did he say "fuckin" at around 3:30? I think he got pissed off at the camera. I think he thinks it stopped. Lol, anyway, it was a helpful video.
Great video thank you it really helped you've got a new subscriber x
Brilliant, as always. Thanks Wayne x
3:30??????? I dieeeeeeeeddddd! Haha
What happened at around 3:30?! :P
you are so fantastic. I just love you!
Wayne, (hello!) I feel like when I try to conceal clusters of spots it looks cakey or obvious no matter what. Help!
Perhaps u should clarify what it was we all think u said sugar...ever so curious. ?.
You are just awesome! Thank you for sharing your knowledge!
Lol did he say fu$&#$ rewind........yes he did I don't care I still love his videos!!
Hahaha!! I was like " what? Did i hear him correctly?" Then I played it back and started cracking up!
I like make-up gurus on youtube like M. Phan or Bubz but you are the only one who taught me how to use make-up in right way!! As you said in one of your videos. These girls have much more space to do their eye-makeup and it will never look the same on non-asian person. I´ve never used blush or highlighter until I saw you, ´cause I didn´t know, how to use it on my face (shape). Thank you sooo much! Thanks to you my make-up "world" grows bigger. ;)
once again, a fantastic video - thank you!
loveddddd this video!
You're so gifted is ridiculous!!! God blessed YOU!!
3:30 ?!?  I think it was....fu&$him and a cordial wave.   Awesome
Hello there, are you familiar with "HAIRator" yet? Simply take a look at their web site on  ｈｔｔｐ://ｈａｉｒａｔｏｒ.ｃｏｍ  There I  have discovered a good and pain-free body hair removal treatment that needs no waxing or shaving. Actually, that solution has even been highlighted in Vogue. It made it possible for Cindy to enjoy long lasting smooth skin. I hope it helps you also.
Love your videos :) What do you think about the "mousse" concealers/foundations? Would love to see a vid on those! :)
So much emphasis on the "fuckin" and then SILENCE. rofl. I laughed so much. Love you, Wayne.
I just love you honey!!! But wait! Where did you get this palette! It looks amazing ^^
Kind of aggressive .... I like him, us just that I didn't see it coming
You are awesome in so glad I found you .. love you
3:30 I didn't see that coming!!!! OMG! LMFAO! I love you Wayne!
Genius!
A powder concealer is a concealer that is a powder, as opposed to a cream or liquid.
More bloopers Wayne!  I loved this.
Thanks so much help loved it :D
awesome as usual :*
Thanks advised
this is old video.  I hadn't seen before.  I'm glad you didn't take the blooper part out because we all have felt like that at one point or another. Love how straightened up after you said $%&&=_-@. . .I played it a couple of times. . .got a really good chuckle from it. . .<3
Gosh, he's so cute.
HAHA, I can hear the frustration through the expression. Great video btw. Thank you.
oh God I needed this. My concealer always settles in the line under my eye and just enhances the line making me look so tired and old :(

The first method was just amazing. Just did it!
Wayne, I freaking love you so much, you brilliant man you<3
Every time I do my concealer in the morning, like at 6 am, it fades in about 2 hours. But when I do it at noon... It stays for a loooong time. Why is that!? Can someone tell me? Wayne?
Lol !
Purrrrfect. Love the slip, you are a real human, lol
Very helpful video. Thank you so much!! <3
Omg thank you! I love you ! It would mean the world to me if you replied!
Which concealer would you recommend for over 50 skin with lines?
I always had problems getting concealer to look good on myself and clients until I started just slathering it on and blending it out like your first two methods.  I think you really need specific kinds of concealers for the spot methods to look good. I also colour-correct first and then use a lighter weight concealer with some light reflection in it.
Great tip about looking straight ahead and down to concealer dark under eyes!
I wonder if you were going to edit that little 'slip' or you just thought f--k it, I'm leaving it in? Well you did promise to be yourself, naughty boy! Wink xx
Did any one else catch the fuck it.. !! Lol
I love how you also refer to woman of colour  and  say what we can use also love love u and your videos
You sir, are a gift!
<3 thanks for this x
Method 1# Do you use that over foundation?
I just love love love your personality!!! LOL
Great video!!! Nice BRAIN FREEZE LOL
love your videos..... <3 .. what do you think about the garnier roll-on concealer? i have like a purpleor blue dark circles and it doesn't work for me .. i think because i'm not appling it in the god way.. pleaseee help me because every morning i look  realy ugly and tired...
If I could have one wish it would be for you to do my make up for my wedding. I would feel like a princess for the day x
I LOVE U
Hi, have you heard about Break Free of Acne? Just check out that internet site on  ｈｔｔｐ://ＢｒｅａｋＦｒｅｅＯｆＡｃｎｅ.ｃｏｍ  On their website you will find a great free  video showing the best way to treat acne easily. This made it easier for Isabel to get amazing clean skin within 30-60 days. Hopefully it works for you too...
If that's a blooper, they need to bloop every other of my words ;-)
LMAO the blooper hahah!
how can i wear JUST CONCEALER, NO FOUNDATION... cuz none of them cover the darkness properly :/
Thanks for the video Wayne! Now...@Sophieandcami ur a moron! People that aren't a member off the tiny brain club watch his videos because he's amazing at his craft! If u took some time to watch a few of his tutorials u would realize that! There's no trickery because he also uses thumbnails of himself. U should not criticize if u don't know what ur talking about!
You are sooooo good!! I wish you long life and continued success
You do pictures of girls for for screenshot so people will watch your videos..
i loooooooooooove it when you wink!!! :)
I officially fell in love with you at 3:32 !
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME!! i just bought mac pro longwear concealer in nw25 and it was a little to dark for me i guess i need nw20, is there any way to apply it to make it look as good as possible even thought it is a little dark for me ??? PLEASE HELP ME !!! by the way love your videos. best regards from russia :)
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
ROFL....nobody can make a "bloomper" funnier than you can, ahahahaha
your blooper was soooo funny !!!! ha ha
Youre amaze
Everybody got that fuckin part??
Try Revlon's Photo Ready Concealer its great
Try applying a moisturising eye cream after your moisturiser and then applying primer to your skin. Apply the concealer before your foundation because then the foundation and concealer can blend together, then take a loose powder and use a small setting brush to set the under eye area. pat the powder on instead of rubbing it. hope this helps! x
In the more info section it only says the concealer that he loves not the one that he is actully using in this video. so if you do happan to find out feel free to let me know! Thanks :)
Click on the show more info box (near the top, under the video)
Omg, your videos are a time vortex! I look up five minutes later and it's midnight!!
Try Men Pen Concealer:)
Can you make a video on the best powder concealers? They seem cool but I'm skeptical about how much coverage certain ones have
@KeepingupwithKatly , I used to use that concealer and it becomes very dry and cakey. I tried primers & Everything. I recently switched to a NARS concealer and its the best! I also purchased a concealer brush which also helps alot with blending the concealer and making it last. Also, As soon as i finish applying concealer, I add finishing powder right away. It lasts me all day and does not crease.
hahaaaaaaa like the blooper
fuck him?
Please please can anyone tell me the exact name of the product that is being used including the brand. Thanks in advance
lol i liked the blooper too lol
wow I love the first stippling brush method! I bought a cle de peau stick concealer after loving the way it looked at the counter but after I got home I didn't really know how to use it like the counter person did. Thank you you're amazing!!!
hahaha thnk you that was very helpfull :) x
Thanks, If you come Jamaica let me know, plz and try on me...
Thank you was having trouble with under eye concealer
i cant hide my eye bags by this technique rather they got more prominent
Lol your cool :)
Hahaha I love how you randomly said "fuck it". :-)
Lol did he say Fu*k it lol
Lol what the hell happens at 3.30!?
WTH?! Did anyone see that?!
I bought the makeup forever camouflage palette or something like that. The one that comes with the violet tone. I have no clue what that one is for. Can u make a video explaining how that particular violet tone works or what it's meant to cover? Plzzzz
Were you having a bad day when you made this video, Wayne? You seem distressed.
Love #1! Im def. Getting me one of those brushes today.
I think you should go to sephora and ask them to help you find a foundation and concealer. Ask them a million questions; how can i find my color myself, what kind of foundation formula should i be going towards, etc. Also after you've gotten a perfect color at the store, the next time you need new foundation can bring your bottle with you when you go shopping and match the colors by yourself.
you got THIN!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
Best moment of the whole video has to be at 3:30
Also I would like to match my face skin tone with my body what is very difficult, because my face is so pale but my body has darker colour. Is there anyone who knows kind of makeup or some tricks and tips? Thank you :)
I have really big problem to find makeup to match my skin tone. My skin tone is like a olive tone colour. Not like a Shrek..lol.. I am 100 percent sure that my face or my body does not have this kind of "warm" tone, but "cold"...I am not sure if you know what I mean. I can not use makeup for instance.. Bourjois healthy mix serum, because I think that this kind of makeup is quite warm or pink/yellow.. can not describe properly.
love this guy
omg when you swore i love you
I have been using the Mac concealer for my under eyes to highlight, and also around my eyebrow bone. I looks great when I first apply it, but when I go to school and look at myself it looks horrid ! I use it over my moisturizer, and foundation. My skin is flawless when I do not use it. I just apply my moisturizer and my Mac face & body foundation . I do not want to return the concealer because it looks very good at first, please help ! Tell me how to make it smoother !!! Pleasee
I have dry patches under my eyes, what's the best way to use a concealer to conceal dark eye circles when you got dry patches?
LOL.. if I have to explain what that means to you there is no point Ruqss H. Just not worth it, but I will hope one day you can understand it. Good luck. :)
HAHAHA 3:30!!!!!!!
He us using the Makeup Atelier Paris Concealer/Corrector palettes
Thanks for showing the palette for darker women! Love your work!
It took me a second to realize that he just had a oops time! But still very professional and put himself back together!
You're good!
Make a video for dark bad circles on warm skin color.
Loved the blooper. It means ur not perfect even though u kinda are!  Lol xoxo!!
WOW YOU ARE GOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!  What palete are you using Im trying to find a good one and yours looks AMAZING! KISS and keep the good work! :D
so cute as to how you know how to apply make-up :') nawwwwh :')
i'm curious as to why you didn't just re film that part and why you just stood there at 3:30
Ahh! Blooper moment I just loved it <3
What is the name of the concealer pallete please?
I have very bad dark  circle i had bougjht maybeline lumi highliting concelor but it make my dark circle grey , plz help what shuld i buy to conceal my dark dark dark circle
Which palette is this, please?
Nice video! Keep uploading videos for tutorial:)
sure is right.  i am glad to see maybelline mascara which i got previous week as a gift from them. and i can tell u , email and your address is enough to get your mascara gift. its worth a try here  --> bit.ly\Yo5ZL3
what concealer are you using in this vid..its soo informative & i love the conceler..please i appreciate if you respond.. thanks.. :D
3:25 lol I'm such a child XD great video
omgg loved the blooper momentttt <3
Oopse did he have a Freudian moment at someone?! I lurrve him xoxo
can concealer be used as a cover up of your whole face
Try the Bobbi Brown corrector. Trust me I have almost black under eye circles, they are the worst! So I feel your pain :( But honestly, use that corrector underneath your concealer and it will fade away, you don't have to apply lots of concealer over it as well, which is great. Hope this helps x
I do and primer helps...try using Smashbox Photofinish. Not sure if people know to apply primer under the eyes, but special attention there can help with creasing. I am also a big fan of the garnier rollerball concealer for undereyes.
my favorite video!
He is awesome i love him! And by the way i was surprised to hear the f word lol ;)
I have such a big issue using under eye concealer. My under eye skin is so thin and seems to sink in a bit. I also have a pretty deep crease just below my water line. The concealer never seems to get rid of the sunken look and also seems to settle very badly in my creases. I have tried several different types from the heavy cream concealers to the very liquidy ones...but nothing seems to work right for me. Anyone have the same issues?
the first male make up artist I found on youtube. its a good video though. Subscribed.
Say h2o 7 times post this on two other vids then touch water
I have to apply LOTS of concealer to cover my dark circles. v___v
@xpsdrkh yep i agree. i really got shocked when i receive my maybelline beauty kit without any dime @ my home yesterday. And, is really easy to register for your gift, just give ur email and delivery address. its worth a try here  >->  bit.ly/YMZFm7?=ctvdvv
Great info. Thank you
lol at the blooper
do you have a video on how to conceal blemishes?
I have seen many makeup artist do makeup, but never as well as his videos.  I really love that he shows such brilliant techniques that I haven't seen done by any other pakeup artist or makeup instructors!  He is fabulous and my favorite to watch!
i liked this video just because of your blooper lol
Thank you for the vid. I've never used concealer a before. Have always just used foundation but I try not to get too close around the inner corner of my eye because it seems to just  emphasize my crease/wrinkle. Will concealers do the same?
Thanks for the reply! But where do I get the pigment?
U R Mine ! I LOVe You !
Thanks! But I really should go... I'm trying to read but I keep coming back to your videos lol There are just too many videos I want to watch from you!

wow.. that was good.. he's good.. thanks for the tips! : )
I don't mean to be offensive but is he gay?
LOOOOOOL so funny swearing xD <3
3:30 ... Omg I laughed so hard
Fish oil is good for the brain! :~) And Avocado too lol....  It's okay you are human, we all have brain farts.
Lmao!!!!!!!! I love it tho!!!!!
And if im using a liquid foundation...would I use it first.... then conceal the eyes? Because he said dont conceal to the lower lash line.. if im covering bags after applying concealer to them do I blend it up towards the eye... *confused*  And is it necessary to apply liquid makeup on the eye as well as the whole face?
"i want to win makeup
Hahahahaha! Did you forget to edit the part you choked a bit or you just left in not caring? Either way, that was hilarious! Love you!
can we use beauty blender for concealer?
Lol oh man I love you... Just let it out...

1 of my favorite videos
Language! im discusted.  ha.
Im in love...sigh..
Hi Wayne!  :)  Can you make a video about how to cover red spots?  Whenever I get a pimple it leaves a red mark where it was, and it seems like they're impossible to cover on my skin!
I just burst out laughing when you cussed!
I LOVE METHOD 1!!
Wayne you are the best!!!!! Love you!!!!
that blooper was so funny he was so embarassed hahaha :) hes cool
Hello from France!!! first of all i really really like your vidéos and everythings you do!!!!  As a woman of color i was looking for the 3rd palette of makeup atelier but didn't find it!!!  can you help me? thanks!!!!
hi, can you specify what brands are you using in this video? thank you
I just adore you Wayne! Love the blooper, so funny!
what brand did you use in this tutorial?
i like it very much ..i apply cream concealar with wet spong or my finger but after a while i can c bright lines of concealar accumelating in very small wrinkles under my eyes what should i do to avoid this although it looks perfect when i first apply
D: don't get frustrated, stutters and forgetting your train of thought lets us know you're human too :)
Extremely helpful!!!   Thanks
I was being dead ass nigga just stopped outta nowhere I had to rewind it back to see what was wrong .. Still don't know why he did that I'm sleep though .. Lls
LOOOOL I can't even watch the rest of this video I'm laughing so hard! LOL
Wtf was this nigga doing at 3:30-3:37 .. Great video though ima try this out
sorry, i already posted, but have a question. as i stated before, i bought a concealer from mac, but now know i should  have bought a corrector. does mac make a corrector you would recommend? they'd said i could bring it back if the shade was wrong so now i'd like to "trade" if possible? when looking for a concealer, i had a girl in ulta recommend a peachy corrector (can't remember the brand), but when i looked at the color; i thought she was nuts!! lol..should have listened!!
this tutorial has been enormously helpful!!!...i bought a new mac concealer, but tnk i should have bought a more peachy corrector? have some major purple under the eye and didn't know there was a diff until after i bought it? tnx so much cause i had NO idea how to put any of it on correctly!
Great job on this video.  A lot of women will really appreciate it. I certainly have seen really attractive women ruin their look because they don't know how and over do it.  For most men, a woman that looks overly made up looks somewhat unattractive.  Less is more and the right technique will do wonders.  Again, awesome video.
OMFG!  Where have you been all of my life!
Ur tips are so helpful!!!!!
awesome tips !!! Love it and subscribed :)
THANK U FOR ALL THE VIDEOS!!!!!

I love you! You have the best advice
You sound young, stupid, insecure, or all three. I hope you grow up and become a better human being.
Is it really needed to apply concealer on top of the corrector?
Won't the eyeshadow smudge with it since u kinda applied it in the eyeshadow area?
Thankyou so much!!

I have 2 questions Mr. Goss:  1. What is the difference between a corrector and a concealer? 2. I have dark circles under my eyes and with to get the KK highlight. Do I apply a concealer that matches my skintone first and then add the lighter concealer; or do I just use the lighter concealer/
hmmmmmmmmmmm awesome..........
hahaha I loved the frustration moment 3:37
Did you just call him a..fat sponge?...BAHAHAH ;D
are you a girl or boy?
what video editor or movie maker do you use? please answer
I have REALLY dark circles because of a heart condition I have (it literally, legitimately, looks like someone's punched me in the face lol) but I'm SO GLAD Wayne has exposed me to this concealer palette from Makeup Atelier as well as the Mehron foundations because they are the only things that actually work for me! Very much recommend them!! This may sound silly, but I feel like these videos have seriously changed my life and how I feel about my dark circles! So honestly, thank you!!!
How do we buy the palate if we live in the US?
Great video! Awesome advice.  hahaha Brain fart at 3:32 XD (loved it)
Hi! Doesn´t your concealer crease if you apply such large amounts?? Thta´s my concern because I have tons of little lines :( thanks for the great tips. xo
Thank you so much for the helpful tips, im polynesian so my skin is tan and ive been having trouble finding the right concealer colors i should be using.:)

Everytime you swear.....I love you even more!  xxoxo
woah! amazing! Thank you for the tips:-)
.... Wayne, I learn soooo much from you and that mishap was cute, and ur still beautiful to look at ^_~
What number/shade of Makeup Atelier Paris Concealer/Corrector palettes are you using??
I thought he will makeup some one, no himself. Cool! Lovely accent!
LOL !  I soooo love you !  ha !  you are so humble & " common ".      you are truly "0ne of us! "            : )      everyone makes mistakes - but it's how we handle it - that really makes the difference.       you have a way of making us feel closer to you when you stumble & gracefully pick yourself back up and just move forward.   God bless the humble !      ; )
what concealer palette was he using??
I loved the wink ;)
Hi gurú!!! I have a question!!! I use Laura mercier camouflage on some dark spots right in the middle of my cheeks and also under my eyes, after, I set it with a translucent powder but it cracks! I feel bad because I spend all this time trying to cover those spots and I look like a 60 year old because of the cracks on my corrector...;( I just don't know what to do or what product to buy ;( maybe a different powder of concealer ? Please help me!!!?
He probably went to wash his face and returned, that is my hypothesis. so funny tho.
I haven't had time to get on youtube to watch your videos lately, but I love that I started with this one because you totally made my day with your blooper.  Love the video btw.
Great video-I especially loved the little melt down, I scream the F word while I'm filming every 5 seconds. Sometimes I even throw my brushes. ;)
LOL wtf? I don't even know what happened in the blooper part. Haha why'd you freeze up Wayne? haha so funny :D
very helpful.. can these products be order on line?
i spit out my tea laughing at the blooper but, this video was so helpful!
What happened in the middle of the video? Lol
Please - !!!  Free makeup would totally make my year!!!!  Love it !!!  Thankyouforeverythingyouarejustthebest!!!
awww..that blooper was hilarious! no worries..nooo worries. I felt that frustration..lmao..but be easy on yourself!
The blooper was sooooooooooo cute!
lmao what? especially if you are doing what?
Thank you Goss! your concealer and foundation videos are always muy informative = )  Btw I love how you call us "women of color". It sounds beautiful in your accent
I keep wishing and hoping that you'll do a very deep toned set of tutorials...like color correcting...highlighting and contourig ( extremly hard for very deep tones to figure out) and foundaton matching. I'm learning everything through trial and error and it's expensive plus your like the best instructor on YT, always so detailed.
Lol love that blooper!! Made me lol! Great tips . Thank you :)
hahahahahahahah!!! love your vids but i absolutely LOVE the blooper!!!!!!!! :)
wayne you are the master!

You are too funny, you should keep the bloopers, I loved it!

HAAAAHAHAHAHA BLOOPER!! Love it!
just magnificent. I love your work
:)
Love all your videos :)
You will regret for realizing about Acne Miracle Pro just now; it is the formula behind the spotless face of most movie stars. Do a Google Search on it to see how it works
Before or after foundation?
Very nice job.  I learned a lot
*hug*
Oh that's so smart! Thanks!
i'd love to win sigma!
LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great vid... :) n lol great pause... Haha
poker face lmao 3:36
HAHAHAHAHA the blooper! HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!
He is SHOWING how to do it for YOUR BENEFIT. Seriously people are so weird on this channel. He is a professional makeup artist and we are lucky enough that he is sharing our knowledge and tips with us and he works so hard and puts so much time into these videos. And secondly, nothing is wrong with men wearing makeup. Once in a while when my boyfriend gets a bad breakout or bad bags under his eyes when we are going somewhere I will conceal and set for him and it looks GREAT!
THE BEST BLOOPER EVER! YOU MADE MY NIGHT!
lol love the blooper lol
LOL!!! your blooper face is PRICELESS LOL !!!!❤
lmao at the blooper
Love this tutorial! I always learn so much from your tutorials! Whenever I am off, or have a chance, I tune in- Many thanks!

Love, love, love this tutorial.  I'm so glad you showed the concealer palette for dark skin. Thanks!

how else is he going to demonstrate... makeup isn't just for girls.
hahahahahahahahhahah, cursing and a little burst of attitude, priceless... love it..
Sorry to come and comment over your comment... but I like the first one too! It's the one I had never seen anyone do or teach!
Sure it does if you are interested in make up, not in someone's personal sexual orientation. Make up is what he does and this is what I came to know about.
It scared me a little when you stuffed up hahahaha
Mr potty mouth!! O_o
Does it matter?
Thanks for keeping the *bleep*. Fantastic ;) oh, and the techs were great too
Method one, blending with a stippling brush IS amazing. Thank you, you adorable wizard of cosmetic wonders! I have more (ahem) mature skin and for the last three days I've been using a brush and blending just as you demonstrated and it actually looks so much more natural and smooth under my eyes. It's a wonder and so are you! I watch every video you do.
OMG that (3:32) was funny and  cute, you are quite  fierce and volatile aren't you... :-*

Practicing, practicing!!! :/ :)
- I LOVED methods 1 & 5! They were great.
Thank you for this very instructive video.    My question is a problem re: eye bases. I've tried various combinations of: Neutrogena 3-in-1 eye cream/color base, w/ & w/o Two Faced Shadow Insurance, & w/ & w/out a dusting of Laura Mercier translucent powder, all prior to applying any shadow products (MAC paint pots, NYX pencils, pressed shadow, etc).    I still occasionally have a chalky, hard to blend base before shadow application.  Any suggestions?  Many thanks, gale.freeman@gmail.com
I asked too fast. The answer is from your videos.   Wayne, can you please do a review or comment on fine lines/wrinkles fillers? I am sure many of us would be curious about those products.  Hope that you will do....  Thank you so much!!!
Hi Wayne, are we supposed to be applying foundation under the undereye area first, followed by the corrector or leave out the foundation & apply the corrector directly onto the dark circles? Thank you
nice video... thanks ive learned a lot...
I really do like your videos, you take your job so seriously and you really do love it. It is a real  pleasure to see people who cares about what they do. You really share right staff and I think you really want people do the things in a right way and you have no hesitate to share all of your knowladge about make up. I am just so suprised...
Thanks for the tips!!
grazie!!!!!

Omg did he said " fuck it " lol not bad he made me laugh

Oh, my God, at 3:35 he looked just like one of my second graders getting upset with himself if he doesn't know an answer!!! I think you are awesome..    :D  Thanks for the lesson!!!!
What do you suggest for fine lines, i also have texture, i am having the hardest time trying to cover darkness under my eyes, i also fine that if i go light it doesnt cover if a go any more than sheer i get creasing, yes even if i use a base and even after i just a setting powder, anything to suggest?

The first way is going to be my stable!! This tutorial is soo good. Is it possible to wear concealer only makeup under/around yhe eyes without the foundation,powders etc bcus I hate having all that stuff on my face

Is the methods for applying a concealer the same for when applying a corrector?
Great tips!
When you say you can go lighter with your concealer, how many shades lighter would you recommend? I have dark circles so not sure how light I should go..
Very helpful! :)
Hy Wayne! I always learn something new from you... I must try use a damp sponge. TY :)

Wayne you have to try amazing cosmetics concealer..!!! that stuff is AMAZING. the brand stated creating this concealer they are feamous for.... It is very expensive but you dont need a corrector befor applying it so it make you save that money,... The covergae is AMAZING,, LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.
This was so helpful! Thank you!

Thank you for this, def gonna attempt the stippling effect!
Lol love that *beep* got a bit confused at first!
Lol "FUCKING" Whata Boss!!!!! XD
Love your videos and have subscribed!!  I've learned a great deal with the videos I have watched !!! Thank you and i will continue to looks at the others:)
love your tips. your so awesome. :)
THank YOU!
Thanks for always trying to include women of color in your vlogs,  a lot of make-up vlogs don't give alternatives or options for darker girls  ^____^
My Mac studio finish  concealer is a little bit dry, what do you suggest I do to keep it creamy?
LMAOOO BWAHAHHA UR BLOOPER...SO CUTE "FUCKING!!" LOL
Nah, not while your being sexist, ignorant and offensive we won't.
your so my makeup god
i said no offence i was asking and dont tell me to get a life u get a life and get ovr it
What are some good concealers or correctors for women of color?
you're really good, i love your videos, very professional!!
OMG people like you are so bloody small minded! who says that makeup is just for girls (im a girl myself btw before you probably start naming me gay etc)..... your mind is so narrow just... make it disappear completely. thankyou goodbye
I love that you kept the blooper!!! hahahaha...had to keep from laughing out loud...=D
Lolz!!!!!!! Blip still laughing!!!! Was a bit confused at first!!!! Love ur videos!!!! Hahahahahahahahha!!! Too funny!xxxx
He is a PROFESSIONAL makeup artist. It's his job. Get a life and grow up!!
Thanks for the great video. Concealer is definitely my weakest area!
Ha HA  love the blooper in between!!! I wish I could meet you. You are awesome!!!
It'll be great if u could look straight into the cam when you are filming. It gives your viewers a closer personal touch. One trick to do that is to put a picture or a toy (with eyes) right above the cam's lens, and it can help u to maintain eye contact with your viewers, so to speak. Hope it helps :)
Wat was that for?
You are a doll! :)
LMAOO @ the blooper.. love it!!
Do you already have a video on how to cover pimples with concealer? I always end up having it rub off the center and just create an annoying lighter toned circle around it. Please do a video for the pimple ridden population too lol
ahahahahahahahaha - I rewound the blooper 4 times cause I was laughing so hard.. LOVE that you left it in!! :):) ( love your videos)
awwwwwwwwwwww  you are sooo cute !!
Thank you!
You're amazing!! Videos help sooo much
you are so amazing!! love you!!
No joke!   In this vid he looks like jude law
loved that moment Fuckin..! love ya dude!
i have a very dry skin around my eyes... do i have to put something before concealer? Cuz i have a thin skin and wrinkles around eyes (i'm 24!) so when i put concealer or corector they are more visible... tnx!
Thnx was looking for this. I tend to have dry under eyes so I may try the stippling brush method or spong.
Gosh, your videos almost make me want to go back to being a makeup artist. And damn good trick with blending concealer in with the duo fiber brush. That is some brilliant shit! You have permanently altered my makeup routine. I think it should be coined the "Goss Method" for real.
I Love you and all of your videos!!! ;)
Can't he use makeup because he's a man? Well that's weird... Many guys have quite the same ''problems'' and girls, circles, acne and others. Why can't they try to hide it like girls with a little bit of makeup:)?
Your awesome
I'm always too pale for any make up I find. Where I live, there's only a few limited counters, but Sephora is coming. Hopefully they'll have something.
i couldnt stop laughing at 3:30! omg  love your videos!
I'm agree....you're really a makeup genius...
you make me wanna throw away my bachelor's degree in philosophy and start a new career as a make-up artist... you're that awesome :)
Wow just dscovered u, I think I'm addicted lol!
Goss, do you use the concealer before or after foundation and what does moisten the brush do for the process?
3:30 HILARIOUS  ur welcome love you wayne
Thanks!!!!!! I'll give it a shot :)
great video, thanks! o would love to see a video on how to cover blemishes
oh look, wayne has a video on it!! just found it but youtube wont let me paste the link. the video is called "how to: stop concealer from creasing". hehe ;)
"fucking!" made me actually laugh out loud! rules!! :)
i have those lines too! just right under my eyes. they r so annoying, concealer always cakes up in them. glad to know i'm not the only one :) wayne can you please tell us what to do with these lines?? :)
god bless you, you're awesome!
Love all your videos.  Thank you for all the great information and techniques.
i have bumps under my eyes so when i have corrector or concealer on it looks fake and is totally noticeable! what do i dooo?!
yeah i have the same issue with fine lines but no one seems to know what to do with them...as much as i like concealer its a nightmare because of the fine lines...
YAY for not editing out the blooper
:-)
I LOVE your videos. I have watched hundreds of tutorials and yours is by far the best.  You actually TEACH as opposed to showing only. For those of us who can't afford or do not have the time to go to beauty school, Thank You.
LOOOOVE U !!!!
Makeup is essentially painting instead your face is the canvas and traditional masters were mostly men. I'd like to see you do a better a job.
i like the background
Make-up is definitely not only for females. Males can use it too. So Idk what you're talking about
I would really love if you had any tips for applying a strong eyeliner to a hooded eye. I always get transfer and it looks awful :(
that was a fucking lovely blooper goss ;)
Your videos are so helpful. Thanks for taking time out to help me achieve my flawless look.
This guy... The most charming male-makeup expert ever. Period. End of story.
After your verbal slip up you looked like a guilty puppy! But the vid has helped me improve my makeup enormously.
YOU ARE AWESOME !!!
are his eyes different colour?
Love ur videos. U r amazing
greatt..................thank uuuuuuuuuuu
thankyou so much, i suffer from acne and im constantly looking for new ways to improve the appearence of my skin, this helped a lot and i cannot stop watching your videos.  thankyou so much again! leanne x

Hahahaha! That blooper scared me then made me laugh. You're so cute Wayne! Thanks for this vid. xoxo
thank you very much for this
Love your skin!
erm..shouldn't YOU be a little less judgemental? He probably applies it better than the majority of the female population. So ssh please. Thank you
so helpful! thank you :)
can you recommend which brushes i should get ... great if there is just one set I can buy ... thanks
i love u lol
um no offence at all but shouldnt u be putting that on a girl and not yourself
I have natural lines under my eyes - always had em- and concealer and foundation immediately fall right into them.  Even primer and powder are no match.  Any suggestions?  I also have dark circles but concealers always look horrible under my eyes because of these creases.
You are the best :D <3
Baha ur so cute when ur frustrated
my concealer creases, please help!
what brand of makeup was that??
hahaha you're hilarious! fuck em
i am a new subscriber and i love your videos so informative yet you are very charismatic! perfecto mate!

Your amazing. Your videos are the ones ones that auctally WORK and are not boring. Great job, keep it up .
You`re the BEST,
LMAO! I love you Goss!
*or cut out rather
I suppose he thought he would cut this part off when editing but somehow he didn't ;P
love it.....very helpful
I'v just been off and tried the first technique and it's fantastic. Love love love this thank you for all your tutorials. I literaly stumbled across your vidios while looking for make up tips lets just say i'm a tad over 50 and was begining to feel very down as a lot of the advice out there is not good. And then I found you! Your a tresure I have found my make up hero you are to make up what Gok Wan is to fashion. Love you both, thank you xx
oh and i LOVED the first technique! i´m definitely gonna try it out! :)
i LOVED this video! it´s very funny that you left that blooper! :)
Really good video! I have bags under my eyes and put the concealer on your 4 way, but no makeup bag to no more highlight. What do you recommend me? Sorry, I don't speak english.
i just love your videos, it means lot that you include  product options for darker skin tones,  it really shows that you are including all women of the rainbow :)
The "flub" is the middle appeared to be a Tourette's tic. Maybe it was the accent but it was kind of endearing. I am glad he didn't edit it out. Thank you Mr. Goss for the fabulous advice as always.
Your so talented
Ah man! I absolutely love you! And the swearing too! Haha you're such a great mua! I love learning from you... You make it much easier! I'm a mua myself and I'm still learning... Love love love you!
you always talk about pale skin and dark skin .. what about asian skin? :(
- I have a Bobbi Brown Corrector and according to the videos, you should use the corrector first on days when you need a lot of "help".
video request: how to use correctors! i have a peach one i bought but i'm having a hard time making it look natural
Hi Wayne, for some reason none of your videos seem to work on my youtbe account. I was wondering if you had some new settings on your videos that prevents some people from watching them. I would really appreciate it if you could fix the issue as I really want to watch your new videos.Thanks!
if you use a eyeshadow primer, would you still use concealer over it? or before the primer? :s
youre sooooooooooooo hottttttttttt
I learn something useful every time I watch one of your videos. Thank you!!
Great information and tips!  Keep them coming.  Looking forward to more videos!
LMFAOOOO f#cken?
OMG! you are AMAZING!!!!!! Please, keep doing videos! Now I'm going to have to clear my schedule for the next few days, so I can watch your videos, and practice :)
how do you find out what kind foundation you need? I don't know what shade I need.
@Lilybunz @gossmakeupartist I have the same problem, but when I set it, even with makeup forever translucent powder it looks dry and shows my wrinkles? I am only in my 40's and have just noticed this lately so how do I set it, without setting it it creases and disappears, help us!!!xxoo
Can you please make a video on how to prevent your concealer from creasing under your eyes? i have that problem all the time with all of the concealers i've tried! Please please with a cherry on top?:) & sprinkles too! :D
you are the beauty god!
@NancyBaabe exactly, you said it best..
Iol like how he messes up, he takes time to recover, Waves, and then keeps going ignoring the fact he messed up xD<3
I have try that method with my concealer and it works. Thats a great tip.
My first comment EVER! I was looking for some reviews on the beauty blender and came across your video. I subscribed after watching that one and I watched all your other videos since then, which was 10pm last nught. You are wonderful! I am so appreciative of all the advice and guidance you give freely. Thanks again!
You are a genius when it comes to makeup. I love your videos! ;)

hahaha brain fart.. adorable :)
I'm so happy u did this!
Best concealer application video out there! Thank you
Thank you so much! I finally know how to apply my concealer without it creasing underneath my eyes!!!
Thank you for sharing this with us! P.S. We love bloopers
Could you just explain why there are concealer palettes? What is the purpose of such? Also I prefer powder concealers, any tips on putting THOSE on? Please and thank you
Great video! I especially like method 1. :-) Which stippling brush is the one you used for method one?
can i spray some of the urban decay/skindinavia setting spray instead of water on the stippling brush?
best ever!!!!!
3:31 hahahahaha
I LOVE the stippling brush method. It brightens up the whole area!
I LOVE your videos their all so helpful :)
never thought of using a damp sponge! love the blooper too xx
Love this vid; including the bloopers.  Do u have ts? Just wondering...
Another fantastic Video, I've just started using concealer and I'm totally stuck,now I know this is here I'll be coming back to it a lot. Sorry got to mention your little "f.u.c.k up" haha I had to rewind just to make sure I heard right. Yes I laughed I'm sorry. Think you're amazing :) x
lol .... ur so funny!
Awesome. Thanks!
Awesome love your videos i have learn a lot from you
Awesome video thank u
What concealer palette are you using?
magic
Thank you!
Wayne I need some advise. Basicly I have really obvious dark under eye cirles but since I have tanned skin (south asian skin tone) I find any concealer I use just makes my circles look ashy and worse. Ive tried high end products as well as drug store but would like to try the bobbi brown corrector. What colour would you reccomend, would a pink undertone work, something like deep bisque? I swear covering them is such an ardious endevour ,I'd just like some help! :)
Amazing tips!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great tips!  I never think concealing that inner corner.
bahahahahaha omg im dieying over here!!!! "especially if your doing it uhmmm, you know sort off FUCKING!!" i can't even deal love how u let that on there my favv video good laugh while learning how to do my make up just awesome :)
Buahahahahha, f.u.c.k.i.n.g. blooper! Love it!
one thing i really find great about you is that you manage to stay very manly while applying concealer, amazing!
Request: Makeup dos and don'ts for redheads. Eyebrows being a big focus.
i think ur an amazing artist, love ur tecs. for a person trying to become a artist themselves.  and is really scared, what would u suggest for them,  what would be ur words of wisdom
@elsaluvsyah01 concealers are used to even out the skin tone. let's say u have light spots, then u apply the concealer shade that would match the real color of your skin. correctors are concealer shades used to "correct" colored pigments on the skin. let's say for acne spots which are red, you would have to use a green corrector to neutralize the redness. for bluish spots like under the eye, you would have to use an orange corrector to neutralize, and lastly for violet, use a yellow corrector
You made me laugh at 3:31! I totally know how it feels :)
@gossmakeupartist What is the difference between a corrector and a concealer? Aren't they the same thing?
ZOMG I LOVE YOU! XD im so glad i came across one of your videos!!! XD! ive been telling all my friends about your channel! XD!!!
O_o 3:30??
I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
What kind of a concealer brush is that?
hahahaaaaaa
Omg LMFAO
No, lol, I know what a stippling brush is, use one everyday, i was talking about the other end of your brush, it's jagged. Why?
added this to my favorite list because of the great tips and your unexpected f-bomb moment! thank you! :)
this is fantastic. I have had a look at your amazing eye bag video and I wonder if you could advise about a slightly embarrassing problem I have - I have a long straight horizontal scar on my right cheek and I wonder if I could use the same technique to conceal that (as the under eye bag). It is in a weird place on the apple of my cheek and the scar disappears when I smile. Thanks!
Hahah so funny when you got upset! Could you do a video on how to cover spots?? And also I've bought the mac lip primer but I've heard bad reviews I don't know what to think, cos they say that it makes your lipstick last less time!
You never cease to amaze me... love the blooper =P
God bless you Wayne!!! I have been applying my highlighter with a stippling brush like you suggested and it just rocks!!! Thank you SO much!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone know where to get Makeup Atelier Paris Concealer palettes in the US??
thanks lovely tutorial..
I subscribed just because of the random swearing and frustration.
have you cut the end off of your stippling brush?
hmmm sooo sexy when you made that blooper.
I have been watching each and every one of your videos and looove them.  However i don't hear much advice for my skin tone; (not light nor lady of color) i have olive toned skin with yellowy undertones...would i still use peachy concealers and/or correctors? HELP what should i do to conceal my dark circles????
Lol glad you didn't edit the f-bomb out ;) useful tips thanks for sharing!
OMG ! I LOVE IT ! YOUR THE BEST., AND THE DEEP BREATH AFTER CURSING ;)
wet cottonpad! that´s new!! gonna try that! thanks!
Loving the f-bomb! :D My concealer always creases! So thank you so much for your tips.
Love the deep breathing after the curse word. LOL! Youre the best, Wayne.
@Jewelryize My eyes are the same way, and believe it not, I'm currently loving Maybelline Age Rewind Concealer.  It's the one with the foam applicator on top of it.  On  me, it dries, and doesn't settle or cake in the creases under my eyes.  Every other cream/stick concealer cakes up in the creases.  This one does not do that. You may want to blend a darker one with a lighter one to get the perfect match.  I absolutely love the stuff!
Thank you. P x
For a Kim Kardashian look you use a Highlighter, or a lighter shade foundation. Concealer is to heavy!
but it still creases! what do i do so it wont crease??
Haha even if u meant to edit that out... I'm glad you didn't haha
I have a question.  Under my eye is dark and sunk in.  I also have wrinkles and I find the concealer makes the wrinkles look worse.  Do you have any tips?  Love all your videos!
I had to back track as well, wow you are human after all
will you get flawless blending if you use water to blend oil-based makeup?
it says Mac studio concealer. Do you mean studio finish or sculpt? Love the vid and the fact that you kept the bloopers :)
Genius! Amazing tips. Thanks.
I WOULD LIKE TO WIN MAKEUP! :)

This answered every question I had on the subject of concealing darkness on the face.  Thanks for your time Wayne :)

I hate the F word but you made it sound so hot lol
@sammi042002  Do a search on YT for "eyeshadow for hazel eyes" or try googling the same thing, you will find lots of suggestions.  Hope this helps :)

What would you recommend for us "young" middle aged women that have fine lines around the eyes?? Is there a way to prevent the product making the wrinkles more noticeable... I just tend to use a little concealer or corrector where the dark areas are... Hints please... Much love xx

LMAO!!! that was too funny!!! u had a moment. and totally trying the methods!!
Thats ok baby you did count to five, besides I love your videos. GOD BLESS!!!
always informative. thanks!
you always have the best videos =)
@ikoppandi unfortunately Wayne will probably never see our requests because 1000 people just had to make comments about the blooper.   couldn't just thumbs up one of the other 900 "oooooooo you made a bloooper" comments?? No, everyone had to make their own "ooooooo you made a bloooper and said a bad word!!!" comment.  (sorry, I am just  cranky about my wrinkly dark circles)
My eyes are really small and my nose is bulbous, so when i apply concealer, my eyes look more smaller and my nose stands out like thats the only thing on my face -.-
just wondering can you conceal to reduce the look of bags? if so make a vid please!
Nice1!! Checkout my uploads!! Comment, sub, rate & LIKE please!! : ) Happy 2012 & God bless u all!! : )
I LOVE U!!!! haha Ur AMAZING! =D!!
Really well done! I tend to just use my fingers or a flat concealer brush for my eyes, might give the sponge a go now. :D
Great tips! Thank you! :-)
Was I the only one that got a little scared when he got mad?
HAHAHAHAHA THE BLOOPER
Hi! I did one of your concealer makeup tricks. The Kim K. one.    I got so many compliments saying I looked "beautiful" today!  Thanks!
This helps so much....thank you
I love the blooper!! I fell out laughing. You made my day. And thanks for the video. I can't wait to try the different options!
tee hi hi:-) Had to remind cause I thought my ears were kidding me...
loved it! you're amazing!
Do you fancy maxineczka?;)
Do you set with a powder immediately following application? If so, which one and how?
Great and handy video!  love it that i now know that it's also good to spray water on a brush instead of the mac fix+ for that purpose. 👍(i don't own that product, but i've seen it from others)
Awwww cute blooper.... hehehe <3
You should write a monthly newsletter of your tutorials!
Thank you.. :-)

THank you Wayne, I would love it if you would do a tutorial on how to apply concealor to wrinkly dark undereye circles....  Some how my my concealor more ofter serves to emphasize the wrinkle AND not really cover the darkness perfectly either..... is there any hope?
damn .. you looked pretty angry right there at about 3:33/34
The blooper is my FAVOURITE part.. lol
which concealer you could recommend for dry skin around the eyes and is it possible to to use it for sensitive skin?
I love your videos! I'm so clueless when it comes to applying makeup! God knows I need all the help I can get, lol! :-)

You made me crack up so bad! You just brightened a very dull morning! xx
We are so so lucky to have you teaching us for free! I paid a fortune for a makeup course last year and I swear I learned nothing there compared to what I have learned watching you. I would love to see a video like this about using cream foundations too. Thank you Wayne :-)

This is really helpful! BIG Thanks !!
love the blooper..thumbs up to unedited beauty videos
I tried the first technique yesterday, with a brush, and it worked! And I just wanted to say that I can imagine how hard it is to tell everything you want to say. You're alone, talking to a camera, and off you go. My compliments, you make it seem so easy. But I know from experience how difficult it is. Hugs from the Netherlands xx
Thank you for those useful tips! .
So tomorrow I have a first date with an extremely handsome doctor  ( mother would be so proud ) and instead of immediately calling up my girlfriends for advice on clothes, hair , and makeup what is it I do first? COME WATCH YOUR VIDEOS !!!!! <3 <3   I know you and your videos won't steer me wrong, Wayne :)  What would I do without you?   Kisses from Hawaii dearest guru x x

Wayne!! I saw this video yesterday night... This morning I used the correcter (peach) under eyes (kinda fanned out) and blended it with the duo fibre brush ... Awesome technique!!!!! It blends out beautifully, and my under eye concealer has never looked more natural!!!  I never thought I would/could love a male make up artist, but you are truly amazing!! Love you, and thanks for the awesome/helpful videos!!
I'm from the Philippines and I really love your videos!  I really learn a lot from it! you're a GENIUS!
I really hope you answer my question: After putting on concealer, especially under the eyes, can I use any powder to set it or is there a preferred kind (mineral, sheer, matifying, loose, etc)? Is there an alternative to setting it with powder? Thank you :)
OHMYGOD THAT WAS GREAT ! WE ARE ALL HUMAN DONT WORRY THAT WAS LOVELY SEEING YOUR BLUNDER . LOVE YOUUU

Wow I loved this vid. It was very useful.  I'm tan skinned so getting concealer right is very important.  Right now I look reverse racoon-like but this will help I believe.  PS LOVED LOVED LOVED the blooper. OMG I choked on my coffee and it came out my nose when that happened.  Now everyone in this Starbucks is giving me stares.  Your vids are so real and sincere.  No airs about you - you are genuine and lovely!  I watch you everyday!
Do we have to apply eyeshadow primer before or after concealer? I noticed that in the first demo you applied the concealer to all the eye area (including the eyelid). Thank you very much for all the videos :-)
hahahaaa... the blooper.. stopped me in my tracks. lol
I love that you give tips for all skin tones...thank you again!!!!
Hi Goss, which Make up atelier concealer palette would you recommend for a Chinese girl with NC25-30 skin? Thank you x
Hi gossmakeupartist! Well, it is hard to find the right concealer. The concealer fades away after a while. I use a setting powder, but all the fine lines under the eye seem to grow to gigantic sizes! What would you recommed to do? "Makeup Forever" concealer/shadow base and Laura Mercier "Secret concealer is used and "Rimmel Stay Matte pressed powder transparent, swiping it with a concealer brush and setting the powder with another one.Could you please advise me what and how to do it?
That boomper lol Great tip, I will try that as I always do.

@macvicar123 The correctors have color in them, like orange or green or yellow. Concealers are skin colored.
What's the difference between a corrector and concealer?
You are too too cute! And informative! Bonus!
@SimpleLu09 buy a lower priced one in a darker shade and mix them together that's what I've always done, or pop a bronzer over the top?
My favorite channel I absolutely love you!!

@tshahish The Sigma P86 would be great. That's what I use for under my eyes to blend out my concealer. It's tapered so it would fit into your inner corner.
Great!!
thank you WAYNE for your experience sharing
Great video,what concealers do you recommend for dry -sensitive skin?Thanks
I have a problem concealing in my inner corner as its very deep set, what brush do you suggest I use for it, as my finger doesn't reach it well enough? thanks and I Love your videos!

hahaha so funny !!!! Love you!
Amazing video!! Thank you very much for the tips x
under-eye concealer really freaks me out... when i use it, it erases EVERYTHING around my eyes and makes my face look super-flat and my eyes look tiny... I always think, EEEK i'd rather have dark circles LOL
Lmaoooooo at the blooper ahahahahahha
i love the unedited blooper! lol shows you makes mistakes too :)

Hello, I always enjoy your videos and recon that your are a great make-up artist who is passionate in what you do! I have a request for you.

Have you tried amazing cosmetic concealer - those that you are showing look thick and I use a very light TM that would look weird with a thick concealer
Do you do concealer before or after  foundation? :| Sorry if thats a stupid question! xx
very very helpful! i have so much trouble as a woman of color not letting my concealer come across ashy
what is the best concealer?=/ kisses from germany!
That was a major blooper! lol Thank u for sharing these tips! :)
haha love the blooper! you rock! happy birthday again!
i cant find any concealer to match my skintone exactly, mine is always slightly lighter, so i put it over blemishes, and then put my foundation over to top, it seems to work for me!
Thank you! I love you! ;D
i have watched a few of your "how to" videos. you give really good tips.  very good correction for me lately :)
I love your no nonsense right to the point explanations. Thank you 2 thumbs up :)
thank you ! really usefull as usual *love you*
can never have too many tips about concealer! it's my favourite mu product- especially with a baby on the way.  great light quality in this video, btw.
@anissamr You mean "Bloomper."
lol at the blooper!!!!!! so funny!!
so so helpful
OH THANK U I NEEDED THIS!
Excellent!!!
I love, love watching your video's. You are great at explaining things and you never forget any woman of color from light to dark:-) pls, keep making videos!
thanks !
*Gasp*  Wayne used a NAUGHTY word!!!!!
like the video but i dont feel that u are the best 'model' to show how to conceal circles cause u dont have actually !
love your vids sooo usefull! have yoou got torrets? in a nice way :) x
What is the name of the lightes palette? Is it CAPC2 ?
what eye cream or moisturizer would you use to hydrate the under-eye?
LUV this video THANKS
lol loved the bloopers! Thanks for all the tips :)
I have such bags i cant cover them it seems or maybe i cant duplicate what you do :( Soetimes i take them out of my photos because im sad how it makes me look old and tired when im energetic and crazy :(
Great blooper!!
What about the veins in under eye area? Should I use a corrector or concealer for them?
@missfetisha just my view. A corrector is on that corrects the greenish or bluish tones. Therefore, for acne, you might want a green corrector to counteract the redness, and if does not have enough coverage, you might then want to get a concealor. But in all honesty, concealors alone do the job just fine but you need to be careful not to cake it on.
I was like DID HE JUST say that lol and then he awkwardly waved at us lol xD so funny!  LOVE YOU GOSS<3
Your videos have helped me a great deal. I appreciate you taking the time to make these kind of videos. Thank you!~*
Mr Goss, you missed the expletive in your edit (just before you started demonstrating method 3).
You are so handsome.
AS ALWAYS...BRILLIANT. THANK YOU. <3
How much is the corrector pallette?
wow!! the method 1 is.... AMAZING!!! did you leave me speechless! :D I LOVE YOU!!
please show something for purple dark circles
Lots of great tips. Love the blooper!
@anissamr what blooper??
@missfetisha I'm not Wayne, but I believe concealer is more to conceal/mask things such as blemishes, scars and other skin imperfections and corrector is more to even out discoloration of the skin tone, whether it's dark circles, veins or redness around nose/mouth area, etc.  That's how I use each one.
@pissa2 thank you. very helpful. so the beige corrector would be used more to cover dark circles and go under the concealer?
@belledingdong thank you!
METHOD 1 = WOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW  !!!
ooops...fk
@missfetisha i think concealer is a product whereas a corrector refers to something with "colour correcting" properties. for instance, a green based concealer would be called a corrector concealer and it would cover redness much better than a normal neutral based concealer.
@MSsilentxx U're putting too much near your lower lashes. either start from where your eyebags end and pat upwards so it fades out or use a darker colour near your eyelashes. hope this helps.
As usual, wonderful video. I will try the stippling brush method today. Thanks Wayne!
refer to Kanelalam 201o because I only speak Castilian and very little estiendo, work with the translator. thanks
In step three of the application, can you tell me to brush you are using because I think it's just what I need. If anyone knows I would appreciate the report. Thank you.
LOL sooo funny the blooper :)   Love your videos! xxx
i love how you have done so many vidoes on concealer but none of them are the same!!!awsum!!!
@missfetisha Corrector brightens, Concealer conceals. He tweeted this to someone who asked the same question on twitter x
@MSsilentxx try the trick he mentioned with method 3. mascara and a lil bit of taupe sorta colors on the lower lash line. hope this helps..
you are so right when its bad, its really bad.   used a cheap concealer, though it looked great, took a picture and every flaw that i concealed showed upon camera like the concealer illuminated it.  i must have gone way too light.   wish i would have seen this video beforehand.  love your work Wayne.   Thank you for all the vids.
is the mac full coverage foundation still available? i read somewhere it was discontinued....
the blooper was soooo funny! hihihi! thanks for the tips! xxx
I never thought to put water on my brush before apply my concealer. It's really interesting.Thanks a lot for this advice.
Hello, I just want to ask you if there is a trick for dry and wrinkles under the eyes to make it glowy , the concealer always end bad on me....Thank youuu your videos are amazing!!!
@MSsilentxx he actually mentioned it in this video, he said to put on mascara on the lower lashes and/or a pop of color on the lower lashes :)
@weareguavagirls Scottish? Eh?! If you said Welsh or you could hear a Bristol tone to his voice then yeah!
"sorta of fugin" OMG! you're awesome lol  this helped me a lot!
The blooper was sooo HILARIOUS! Loved it! xx
when i watch your videos i become HAPPY! You are amazing !!! n the blooper part just made my day :D
Would you recommend that concealer or cream foundations for very oily skins???
Love the blooper lol great tips too
Sooooo good looking !!! ;) Nice tutorial i have to try the 1st one :)
God I love your videos..LOVE them.. they are so so informative, so to the point...and frankly, just damn helpful to us mere mortals, who usually have no idea what we're doing with our make up.
too much kim kardashian
@MSsilentxx White or peach eye pencil in the waterline :)

LMMFAO I love you .... Just for the " HOLY CRAP " moment on your face and the fact that you left it in added to the fact that your makeup is great!!!!!
Hi, good video. I have a question. Can a concealer cause acne?
Our country SUX! We dont have MAC, NARS, Bobbi Brown, Makeup Atelier Paris, Make up for ever,.. and never heard for Kett brand..  Is there any other concelar (Maybelline, Borjouis, Art deco...itd.) that is good?
Thank you very much for your tips!!!
@MSsilentxx i have the EXACT same problem , and i dont even have asain eyes, but it does the same!
@DebzCM911 i totally agree. you should make a book. id buy it
Language Timothy lolol
I always have probs with applying concealer. I'll try this ways.  And i want to say that i love the endings of your vids. You thank for our time but i think its up to us viewers to thank YOU for your time and sometimes your patience i guess.
hey! i have small eyes (i'm asian) but with double eyelids and whenever i put concealer under my eyes i always notice that it makes me eyes seem even more smaller. is there a trick so this doesn't happen? thanks!
i recently got a mac concealer and this really helped. thanks
I LOVE BRITISH ACCENT
Guapo!!
What about for blemishes such as pimples etc..? Great vid but didnt like the swearing.. :/
@benicebehappy Aww thanks so much!
what if you have really dry under eyes ? i can never wear concealer because it just makes it look worse
Great video, just what i needed heh And the blooper LOL its was so funny, mostly coz it came unexpected. <3
you weren't looking into the lens this time, haha. in your other vids, it just feels more personal esp with the winks haha. btw you scared me there for a second with the "fcking" hahaha, but it's alright! :D very informative video and well-spoken as always! :)
When you got pissed and said fucking I . . . got kinda turned on, can't even lie LOL! But seriously, you do the absolute best makeup-tip videos. Long time fan here. :)
Thank you so much! Never really knew how to use concealer
As someone who suffers from dark circles your advice of corrector and concealer works every time. Thanx again Wayne!
Brilliant video! :)
@WishfulfillingJewel  Well done!!!
you look so fresh and pretty, i wanna bite you.
Wow great trick. Thank you
your blooper was so funny, u should post them more often!
thnx alot:)
Thanks so much for this video. I love your videos. Straight to the point ' so much info. Thx. I would love to see the video on how to cover dark circles. Im light skinned but have really dark circles that are hereditary & haven't been able to cover them without looking like I caked on the makeup with a putty knife. ;0) thx
I can't wait for more concealer tricks ^.^ I'm a beginner and I'm learning alot of things from you. keep up the good work guy
Thank you SO much. I recently lost 140 pounds and am off on a once in a lifetime holiday and really wanted to look my best - but all my family have dark circles under their eyes and I often have bags and have struggled to try and conceal them. I cannot wait to try these out - I really am grateful to you. Love from Tasmania x
I love everything about you, even the bloopers are adorable!!!!
You are such a huge helppp and you're charmingg x
This was so helpful ^^!!!!!!
Thank you!
Can you make a vlog on the best way to conceal under the eye for mature skin, best products and techniques if there is any. Thanks
This was SO helpful! Thank you! I'm a consealer addict, can't go outside without consealer! :P
I tried The first way that u show on the video to apply my concealer and woaw I was amazed it works really good on me, thank you very much
@SevenBesos Wow that's really odd :\ Have you talked to a makeup artist about it? I know the people at Sephora are really helpful when it comes to makeup stuff. Maybe you should just sit down, have a cup of tea with your crease lines and discuss why they're not cooperating with you lol. Sorry I couldn't help though. I hope you find a solution to your problem!
Perfect video, really struggle concealing my under-eye area. Will be having a crack at some of these. However, I have some visable blue veins around my eyes, what kind of concealer/correcter would be best for hiding these?
your videos are simply amazing!
It was really funny. thank you! :)
Pixi brand (target) has a great color corrector concealer I just found, that I love! I'll be sure to try these tips with it!
Oh I love this video - my dark circles are a NIGHTMARE! I'm buying that palette, I need it! :D Actually, what I really want is for you to come shopping with me and help me buy make up, then tell me aaaall your make up knowledge, or write a book!!!! Your tips and info are so book-worthy! Or run a course, I'd sign up! :D :D :D
In my opinion, using a lighter shade of concealer under the whole eye area makes the eye area look more puffy..I don't like that
@alinder34  Lol, me too!!
God I love ur vids u give such great advice! Love love love ur vids...
oh my god.. this is awesome.. you sre so cute even when you make a mistake.. Thanks anyway
@TheDevilsSnare No matter I have a yellow undertone?
oh I've seen right now there's the #286 too. Which brush among # 217-130-188-286 for applying concealer?
Wayne - any particular powder concealers you recommend?
@theeGLAMstarr09 sorry, I meant Bare Minerals, not Benefit!
Hi, thanks for all. I'm an italian woman, so sorry for my english!  What do you think about MAC brushes #130 or #188 for applying concealer? Does #217 have natural hairs? I always used #217 for blending shadows only. I know a new way to use it now, thank you!
@theeGLAMstarr09 I've tried both liquid and cream, but unfortunately both formulas just settle in my crease lines and it looks so terrible and cakey! Even if I just use a little. As for setting powder, I currently use Benefit's "Well-Rested" powder, but I've also tried Laura Mercier's Secret Brightening powder.
@butterflyjune71 Try using a concealer with more of a pink undertone rather than a yellow :)
Honestly many of the gurus explain that if ur darker skin tone that a peachy corrector would look great but I've never understood that someone need to have a darker skin model cuz I'm confused and would I fall into that category im an nc42
Oh, and don't thank us for our time, thank YOU for your time!!
That bloopers scared me!!! Lol
can you please do a tutorial on what make up is the best for people with glasses?? Thanks!
Is there a trick to prevent to look ashy after applying  concealer under the eyes?

BLAHAHAHA @ 3:30-3:38...U r the best Wayne. classic stuff
PLZ do a tutotial for concealing bags under the eye.
Did Wayne just- ... *rewind* ... Yes he did!! Hahaha!
The fact you're not looking into the camera, but to the side of it, is very disturbing haha
thanks but lmao! wat happened?
sooo helpful, thank you!! do you put concealer before or after foundation ?
I don't think i've ever laughed that much at the blooper. It was amazing.
I had to back up the blooper to make sure I heard u proper, then backed it up again just to laugh!!! It was so unexpected! But, i did learn something too...thank u!

Amaizing TIPS,many,simple, and clear!!!!you make makeup sound like ridding the bike!:) Keep up!!
just realize the way you wink is really cute!! :-)
what product line was the concealer?
@lisac2020 Try tabbing it with a beauty blender. It sucks of excess concealer that creases.
I find correctors always smudge off if I put them under foundation/concealer! I have horrible dark circles that I can't seem to get rid of so concealing is really my only option, any suggestions?
i luv the *wink* at the end <3
omg. lol. effin blooper.
funny blooper!! hahaha! but still great info!! :-)
lmao best blooper!!!
ive never heard you curse before hahahaha
@lisac2020  he has anothet video explaining just this and it really helped me.,, primer, concealer, blot, powder...
@lisac2020 try putting a eyeshadow primer underneath your eye and make sure its a sheer one then appy your concealer and a little bit of powder on top to set it make sure its the right concealer too try different ones and and see which one works for you! see if you get a different effect! i used to have this same problem and this is what helped me :)
HAHA blooper, too funny! Replayed 3 times and still laughing
LOL @ the blooper. I was so confused, it came out of nowhere haha. Thanks Wayne for the tips!
The blooper made this video! Thanks for your great tips, as always. Love love love....
Omg, I love your tutorials. You never go off topic and it's easy listening to you. For most gurus I skip ahead or don't watch at all LOL, but for you i watch it through the end xD
lol!  you are too cute!!!  xoxo

@lisac2020  I have the same prob even after setting it with a powder..I heard putting eye primer helps
I swear I am the only person who this happens to- People rave about the Glamaflouge (sp?) by hardcandy being the best concealer but every time I use it it settles into my fine lines... Ive searched for reviews online and can't find any ... I dont get it lol
I often use your advice to see how it works on me.  Low and behold they make a great difference.  I thank you for pesenting these techniques. Peace.
love the major blooper time!!!!!!!!!!!
LOL hahaah blooper ! your the best! xD
Which color the best conceals under-eye blue undertone? my skin is too thin and my veins show through. it looks like i have dark circles, but i have not actually. I have almost the same skin color as yours. Thank you.
So charming, and super helpful too!
@lisac2020 I have this same problem :( so frustrating!
:)

Wayne, can you do a tutorial on tips about how to make your make up and products last longer? Not just in the face, but in the pan itself. I couldn't stop wondering how those concealer palettes don't just dry out...

2 winks in one video? OH MY OH MY MUST BE MY LUCKY DAY :D
LOVE UR VIDEOS!!!! Can u do a video on blush. Rules for applying and choose right color. I am a woman of color!
@brodiekay Gossmakeupartist has a video titled "How To: Stop Concealer From Creasing!"
thanks for your videos! :)
this video is just what i needed. i have been looking up good concealers for weeks now because my eyes are dark due to not enough sleep and stuff like that and i didn't want to just throw product on and it look crazy
How can you avoid creasing with concealer under the eyes?
Good looking dude.
Awesome tip... Thank you!! :)
finally, you uploaded new video and i super like ur tips!!! btw which is better liquid concealer or cream concealer????
@SevenBesos Are you using a liquid or a cream concealer? Whenever I use a liquid concealer, it creases within a matter of hours. Cream concealers tend to stay put with setting powder so I like using them better. Try a cream-based concealer with a setting powder. Also, what setting powder do you use?
love this video!!! thank you!!!!
I liked just because of the blooper part :) It was hilarious
woah ! must try all
Thank you Wayne...hope you alright.....me sad when you sad :(
Which method reduces the appearance of creases under the eye?  Thanks
Thanks for the tutorial.  I appreciate that you gave different methods.  I don't wear make up that often but you have inspired me to try applying at least concealer. I wear glasses most of the time at work and I think it hides my imperfections. But I would like to try this and see if it causes a big difference.    Thanks again...
I have recently moved to brazil... you cannot immagine how much i am struggling with makeup in a different climate... and you cannot immagine how you make me feel good.. just love you to bits.... and, by the way, I love your round mirror and the window!!! so much more than a plain background
Oh my god hahah, I was listening to you from far away and randomly heard "fucking!" I was soo confused. XD
nice blooper hahaha WOW
HAHAHAHA, the best blooper! <3
Wayne, go with the black back round. It looks more classy. White is to plain.. also, love the tip on concelar application and which ones you use. Keep them coming, Always looking forward to an email with a new video.. much love Ivette951
luv ur personality and the look of ur face when u stumbled for words
Blooper or tourette's syndrome? Lol
Wayne, I have a HUGE ISSUE w/ concealer creasing underneath my eyes. The problem is that I have lines there, not wrinkles, but actual crease lines like an eyelid.   My under-eye area is also hollow, so I do need more concealer than normal to brighten.   I've tried MAC, Laura Mercier, Amazing Cosmetics, Bobbi Brown...IT ALL CREASES! :( Even when I set w/ powder. Also tried using UDPP underneath. Nothing helps, it looks cakey & I look like I'm 40 as opposed to 22.  Any tips? PLEASE PLEASE HELP!! x
Could someone please help me?I'm sick of using ordinary cheap drugstore makeup and really want to try MAC or NARS etc.however the nearest store that sells those brands is about 5hrs away! I'd prefer to purchase it online as well but I'm unsure of what foundation/corrector color I would need? How can I find out without having to drive the 5hrs? I'm currently using Maybelline True Fit foundation in 310 and the shade is perfect. I believe I am have neutral tone skin but also more of a yellow tone?
please make a vid on he safe way to remove waterproof mascara! *_*
Thank you!!! Always learning something new from you :) you are the best
These are great tips I am going to try and see which ones works best on me, thanks!!
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!! THAT BLOOPER!!!!!!!! Im dying right now!!!!!!!!!!!!
i like using my stippling brush for the stipping and blending it out slowly that way when it's dry and it works like magic (:
I really love your videos!! May I request you to make more for Asian women eye makeup for monolid eyes?? I would sincerely appreciate it!!!!!
great tips...I will try these methods.  Thank you.  = )
Luv
Dude, you rock. Srsly. You rock!
Thank you so very much. Your videos are so helpful!
Oops just Estée Lauder double wear concealer (not light)
Goss, I need your help! I am having a hell of a time with my concealer turning dark, shadowy, and ashy under my eyes after like 5/6 hours. I keep thinking it is my mascara but it isn't. I use double wear light but am willing to change. Why is this? What do I do? Very frustrated ;)
Great vid - loved the blooper - can you recommend a good eyecream? I find when I apply my concealer for some reason it brings out the dryness under my eyes, which is even worse when I apply loose powder to set my concealer.  I'm currently using Dermalogica Age Smart eyecream but doesn't seem to moisturise the eye area.
Hmmm... bronzer much?
Great video!
Lovely tips as always.  I have to say the blooper was my favorite part though.  Everyone of us that make videos for YouTube have that moment, usually multiple times while filming.  I can't even count how many times I've had to edit out cursing fits I've had. Haha. You should add your bloopers in more often, its getting to see a different side of you.
lol :) love method 1!!
Thanks a lot!
The light background works! No harsh lines as with the black. Did you manually set the white balance on the camera? If not, and was automatic, good for your camera. Watch every video Wayne. Went by a MAC counter yesterday and thought about you...knew exactly what I was looking at too. Thanks!
Thanks for this brilliant concealer video!  Feels like the skies just opened up!  Much appreciated! Love ya!
@asterismxx Maybe look for a shadow primer with SPF in it so you don't have to use foundation on your eyes?
I always forget the inner corner of my eye when I conceal. Thanks for the heads up!
JUST WATCHED THIS TWICE; LOVE METHOD ONE. THANKS!
I wanna meet you !!!! Come to NYC and have a gathering ... PLEASE =D
@GIGI7740 He Made A Short Video About This Creasing Before...Put Primer Underneath.! It Really Works.!
hahaha that blooper
To all you 9 peeps that dont like this... hahaha...
that's the best real blooper I've seen in a while xD I loved it :)
@GIGI7740 he has a video on that (:
I'm so glad you had a human moment there ;)
Since I started using liquid foundation, I brush it over my eyes so the color is even with the rest of my face. But this seems to make my eyeshadow crease really easily :( I do use a good eye primer first (UD, used to work before I started using liquid). I also try powdering over the eye area before eyeshadow but still no luck. Maybe it's because I moisturize my eye area, which is also something I started doing pretty recently. But my eyes need SPF too! Any tips? :(
So helpful and I love that u kept the blooper in!
thanks for another informative vid
I still love the light background!  The pulled out shot for these tutorials is excellent!  It makes it so easy to see the technique.
What luck!  I have been having serious issues with my concealer and you just solved my problems...thank you!
can u review the sigma brushes that u show please?
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this video! I didn't know about spraying my brush with water first. I'm definitely going to try it. Thank you so much, Wayne! You're such a doll! :-)
Ive never commented on each consecutive video Ive watched before. Never really commented much on YT period, but I really have grown a fondness to your methods. I love your videos and this one was great. Loved the blooper haha. and... I think you're hot!
I like the First way to apply concealer
I like the First way to apply concealer
I really like the white background, but part of me misses being able to see the old background. It felt more personal.
ahahhah fuck man i love this video.
wow i JUST got a new concealer! Perfect timing!
learn more today from you... thanks for sharing..
Love ur videos keep making them please
LOOVE IT. I feel much better about goofing up on my vids =). always a pleasure watching your videos
I assume if you've got laugh lines or wrinkles that you wouldn't bring the concealer all the way across, correct?
Lol awesome, I love it!! Thank you for not editing that out - always count on you for honesty :). Very helpful vid too, thanks again!! You're THE BEST for information-packed tutorials!
@Logansbl I have the Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage Concealer in SC-6
Do you apply concealer BEFORE or AFTER foundation, as I have heard different opinions.
Love the wink!
Best makeup artist!!
@gossmakeupartist i am really really light and i am always looking for a brightening concealer for my dark circles ( i have really dark circles too) What would you recommend?
@GIGI7740 He made a video already.. how to stop concealer from creasing
I've never heard you swear before... lol
Thank you for posting this! Its hard enough to find the RIGHT concealer but it's all for nothing if you don't know how to apply right! :D Thank you again for posting!!!
LMAO.. I love you!
I am so grateful for this video. I've noticed my dark circles are getting more noticeable and have been having a hard time figuring out the best way to apply my concealer. Now I have 5 different way to try!
@elizee73 Ty, hun :)
@elizee73 Ty, hun :)
love how you explain ! : )
How do u prevent concealers from creasing? I usually have th problem sometimes, also I love the white back ground. I remember u had asked us n I've seen the black background video u made too, n I think the white one Is the be background for u. s
@trinigal28 I can imagine that must be really damned annoying!
I am so glad to see someone who actually applies concealer to the innermost part of the eye, because that's what I do, I just never see no one else doing it. You're truly amazing!
Love your Videos You Are AMAZING...Thanks for including items to use for darker skin tones...:)
i think your dark circles were definitively gone by the end of this video haha
hahahahaha i love you
@gioetoilejoyeux peach undertones for green/purple skin :)
LOL  BAHHH!!  Love the blooper!  Ok, so I have lines under my eyes and what do I do to minimize those?  No dark circles here, just a few age lines...
what a handsome man ;)
Hhahahhaaaa best blooper ever! So glad you left that in there! xx
3:31 a bil LOL hahaah! What? Didn't wanted to focus??? LOL love you!
How do you prevent concelear from creasing???
That was so funny!  Made my day!  I think I'm putting too much moisturizer under my eyes cuz the concealer just seems to slide off...very frustrating.
i love u
My skin around the eyes is soo freaking thin that I can see green and maybe a blue spider vein. What corrector color do you recommend please? Thank you and hugz <3
that you for making this video
roflmao!!! I had to go back and watch it again. I love seeing the bloopers! That being said this is one of the things I struggle with most. In the last year or so I have developed some discoloration under my eyes (I'm 42) and it's such a struggle getting concealer just right without it settling in the fine lines and just making me look older. I am going to try this technique, fingers crossed! Thank you Wayne!!! xxxoo
Your video made my day! I love the one : How to stop concealer from creasing too.Yep, we have to admit it: they all crease >.< Thanks for the huge help! <3
can i just meet you? ;3
hahaha the blooper! xD love you wayne amazing tips! i always have trouble really blending out my concealer, it always looks caked so i'm definately trying these out :)
hahhahaLOL i love your vids! like many other viewers here, you are the only male makeup artist that i enjoy watching on youtube! :)
what stippling brush do you use?
ooh someone dropped the f-bomb! haha love it.
I was wondering if I could mix ti tecniques?!... Like 2 and 3 ( for better coverage) I have really bad undercircles and bags!!
what would u suggest for covering dark circles mac full cover foundation or mufe full cover
@gossmakeupartist loving everything about this upload! The info, the blooper and especially the white background. In my humble opinion the white background is better than the black. It makes you look brighter and more youthful where the black is more contrasty so gives a harsher appearance. Much love from Oz (Australia that is)
love the blooper!
Wow, looking so handsome here! :)  I love you, you have such great tips and your blooper cracked me up!
@R30RUM So true, I know he made a video about makeup books, i'll be sure to refer back to the video
Great video! Thanks for the super helpfull tricks.
I freakin love you. SO helpful, I have heinous dark circles and I'm only 24. Honestly they look SO bruised I hate it, but this has totally helped me. You're the best, and the blooper made me lol for real. X
whoa! funny and scary at the same time!lol
I just adore your videos. Bloopers was a nice surprise. Lol
It seems others have a concealer creasing/settling issue as well. Maybe an I depth tutorial??
Great video!!!!!!! Thanks so much!!! Can you do different techniques for gel eyeliner too???
you're looking so hot in this video! Thanks for the great tips, as usual :)
Watching you in a few seconds blooper just amaze me
Loool, too funny! I like that!
i love the way you say taupe. love your videos
Had such a crappy day....but that blooper was the highlight of my day!!! Lmao!
@shiddity he actually has a great video on it called: "HOW TO: STOP CONCEALER FROM CREASING!"
I have a deeeeep crease under both eyes and no matter what primer I use, my concealer creases! What can I do??? I need the concealer because I have darkening around my eyes, lids too, so where it creases, my "dark" skin shows through and then I wear glasses so my eyes are always on display! Help! Thx.
I'm going to have to try some of these techniques you showed here.  I'd love to see this same demo done on Mandy.  Where's Mandy???
@trinigal28 thats so true, its really unfair. Maybe start your own channel - take a stand! x
Love this back round
whatttt.... you're not perfect???! I love you even more.... I swear I have learned SO MUCH from two weeks of subscriptions to you.. than 4 yrs of everyone else...
Your so darn adorable....winking back at ya handsome! great tips...
omg, this is amazing! Your the best!
I'm interested trying the first 2 methods I want to try this method with a stick foundation. Do you agree? If yes, which stick foundation would you suggest? Thank you, Wayne!
Brilliant video. Thanks for this.
What about best concealer for wrinkles???
I love your videos and it's so nice that you ALWAYS mention products and colors that will also suit darker skin tones.
Super! Thanks for the tips! :)
Great tips thanks soooo much !!!!!
your blooper kinda scared me!:p
Im cracking up Lol !!! Love it ;)
Awesome job thanks for sharing!!! XxEugenie!
Bloopers r the best !!!! Love Love ur vídeos  n please Primers for oil Skin please!!!!!
I love when you look at the camera better when you talk,at us.Not yourself on the monitor.But you are a lot better then most of makeup gurus.Some don t even care about the camera.They stare at the mirror throughout the whole video. :)
love the blooper!
your blooper hahaha the best
ahh i love ya;))
Loved the blooper. Hilarious.
blooper was the best ahhaa
LMFAO at your blooper. It was epic.
You should make a video for dark circles!!
I love that u didnt edit ur blooper out. Lol It was so natural. Hahaha.
did you just cuss?
The plain white background looks very good! It would be lovely if you could zoom in and out when you apply make-up or show a certain method. Thanks for your amazing videos!
But you have no dark circles! If you do i must have like black holes or something -_-
You need to teach the girls at my school about makeup.
liked the blooper too like imperfections :)))
@shiddity agree!!! i am now 30+, but could not use the generally shown way of really applying concealer up to the waterline even in my early 20s for settling into fine lines.. oddly, when a MUA did it on me it seemed to not give this effect. but when i did it myself, cream, setting powder, everything seemed to accentuate the lines. now i do mostly the technique apparently taught in beauty school, mixed with method 5 :) still, i wonder what I ve been doing wrong?
I didn't know that putting concealer all the way to the bottom lashline made your eyes look smaller! Also, I notice that when I put concealer on, the fine lines under my lashline stand out? Like the concealer doesn't fill those lines in and it looks as if there are little dark discolored lines in between the one with concealer. Does that make sense? I don't know if maybe I should apply a primer to "fill in" those lines so that the concealer just glides over it...?
@shiddity he did that already i think?
Thank you! This video helped me a lot! If its your bday then Happy birthday have a great one :)
I love how you didn't edit out the blooper moment : ) love u!
love this ! thank you :)  great tips!
looooooooooool @ ur blooper!!
Can you explain why brushes shed? Like, mine are only a few months old and they shed terribly. Not like a few hairs. I mean like a ton.   You should write a book. I'd buy it in a heartbeat. (:
Yes!! Finally a brush i actually have :), and useful info too, i just always mess up on concealer -that and eyeliner :D
More bloopers! Hilarious. xD
that blooper was hilarious!!!
Happy birthday Wayne !!!!! ur video very very inspiring n haha hahaha major blooper time hahaha
the blooper kinda surprised me but it was nice to see another part of his personality.
wat happend in the middle!
In my perfect world, you would come over to my home every morning and do my makeup!  I think you're a genious.  Thanks for sharing your talent!
major blooper time hahhaaahhaa i cracked up hahahhahaa u r so funny
Beautiful skin!
This was great. Thanks
@mahaler  the question is not what happened, the question is why didn;t he cut it off...
Thank you Wayne, these tips are fantastic.. amazing to see the dark skin concealers.. so bright! How would I go about contouring a dark skin, someone with ebony skin? I'm guessing I just highlight?  Oh please do not get so angry with yourself.. the blooper was amusing..x
Is it really your birthday sexy Wayne? If so, then HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! Thanks for all the tips! Wish you all the best! :)  Your bloopers was funny! "fuckem" lol
I LOVE your blooper! It reminded me that even the great GossMakeupArtist isn't perfect, though you are close. (:
Lol @ 3:31 wonder if he forgot to edit it...?!
i've noticed male MUA gives more MU tips than females.
@shiddity Depends on the type. Try opting for a mineralized or cream concealer. Liquid tends to settle into fine lines. Hope I helped :)
This is very helpful Wayne I have horrible under eyes circle it genetic I use cream concealer peachy tone w. A dry sponge it comes out cracky looking. I'm of southeast Asian descent when I use brush it leaves streak marks. Ugh
Do u use foundation as concealer too at times?
OMG!  These are great tips.  No wonder I can still see my dark circles, I've been rubbing away my concealer.  I can't wait to try these new techniques.
This was super helpful! Thank you mate :)
happy birthday!
Lol great blooper! And great video very helpful as always!
you really need to stop using "kim kardashian" as your descriptor for everything. please just explain what you mean instead of name dropping; i'm sure she's not the only person in the world who looks the way you're talking about also.
is mandy just a friend? orrr... :D
Loved it thanks.  QUESTION... would you recommend concealer before foundation or the other way around? I value your expertise and thats why I ask. Thank u in advance
LOL, loved the video and the blooper...
Thanks for sharing! :)

Lol. Like everyone said, it's o.k. man. So what you swore, I'm sure people have heard worse. ;) great composure at least you held it together!  Xo
How to avoid concealer from settling into fine lines????
I think I saw the darkness popping out of you...
Never thought my Mac 217 could be a concealer brush. I'll try it out! And may I ask you what you think of Yves Saint Laurent Touche Éclat concealer? Thank you for this video!
Sooo helpful!!
LOOOOL the blooper ! Love you too much!
You should really write a makeup book.  I love all your tips
you are getting more and more fabulous everyday..if you ever gonna get married to someone from youtube, it has to be me, i have been watching your videos since 'sex on fire' was your background song..i deserve it :)
Concealer for face video like this please! ACNE, ACNE SCARS, DARK SPOTS, FRECKLES!
white background and sort of planned video - huge change of your recording method. I like it
ha the swearing made my day.
Happy Birthday! Great Blooper!
Haha you say step 3 twice and you sweaaar:-O did you edit it wrong?
@blackmonroe123 I'll have to check that out. thanks for the response!
wooops a daisy - did you curse? Obscene language from such a pristine man. tee hee ;)
I LOVED the blooper in the middle,you are always so professional and that was funny!  Happy Birthday,I hope all your wishes come true!
Rage moment when you swore, its okay Wayne, we get those moments :P would any of these methods enchance the look of dry under eyes?
Thank you for the idea of using a stippling brush to apply concealer. I applied the concealer all the way out today and I love the way it looks. Thank you for the ideas!! By the way I loved your blooper moment! :)
yes! tell me how to hide my bags please!
i've only just started using a damp sponge to put on foundation... and, bloody hell, how can such a small thing make such a difference!!!  i'll be using these tips far more quickly than i took with the foundation tip
@xGreydaysx silicone face primers apparently
The white background looks great! I love your videos x
Happy Birthday!!!
@LOLhahahahaa And why not?
LOL @ the blooper. loveeee
LMAO!
I love the first method you mention. My only problem with it is that I normally do my eyes first, to get rid of any fall out before I apply foundation/concealer. So, it wouldn't really work if you start with your eyes. :/
double wink is more exciting than a double rainbow
omg i love youuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
love your tips! :)
amazing! hpw is it there are a thousand likes when there are only 300 views o_O
Brilliant! :)
your f*cking Awesome!! dont worry:))...
The skin around my eyes is extremely dry do you have any tips please? <3
hahaha loved the blooper!
aahaha, that blooper :) <3
ok!
Love this!
Thank you for educating me.
how do you prevent concealer from sinking into fine lines under your eyes?
i used a wet sponge for concealer and foundation and it changed my life!!!!!!!!!!! You always have the best techniques and tutorials. I always learn something new!
Genius! Thank you so much for educating us. Kisses!
Love the blooper left in! Wayne I'm worried that if I use concealer in the first way you show us that I will get creasing or crows feet because I've taken the concealer to the outer corner of the eye.It's a double edged because I find it to be the most flattering look in every other way
@moonlighttz lol..me too for a sec he reminded me of ma bf,..he also has that frustrated look when you feel like oh oooh hes gonna explode..RUN FOR UR LIFE..lol
sort of FUCKING good video! :D
OMG I love you!
U are fuckin great ;))
@brownbarbie786 what colour is your skin?
ty =]
lol..love the blooper...LMAO
You are just amazing.  Thanks for keeping us women always looking beautiful.
♥♥♥
Thanks for educating us for free so we don't look like crazy people walking around.  I just love you
Loved the blooper. Shows how real you are. Glad you didn't take it out!!! Great tips!
AWESOME. The concealer part too. ;)
I LOL'ed at 3:30 and on LOL!
Just LOVE LOVE LOVE your videos
Ah, I see! Another great, informative video, Wayne! Thank you! I have definitely seen the 4th method used when I go to the makeup counter. Actually, they also do a thing where they make a triangle underneath (like the Kim K. concealer?) or they take the concealer down at the angle like you did, but it's really um...packed on? I've always had trouble looking for a concealer and I didn't think that maybe it's the way that it's applied is wrong! Thank you for sharing!
looool the "fucking!" part had me laughing so hard I had to pause the video!
you always say that you prefer to apply eye makeup first, and then face makeup, but wouldn't some of the concealer that you applied go over it? or do you just reapply the eye makeup?
bahahaha that blooper made my morning!
@happilyred Me too :s :s
PS. You're looking extra hot today. ;)
This background is alot betta than a stark white or jet blak 3
Happy Birthday, Mr. Goss...wonderful tips as always, thank you.
Another extremely helpful video.thx a lot:)
lol love it! Thanks for always keeping it real
have you abandoned the eve pearl salmon concealers as A Must/Favorite for your makeup kit?!? It seems like Makeup Atelier has taken the lead
I felt scared wen u looked angry then u started to breathe in deep.
@marrydruli LOL.
@marrydruli LMAO!! I laughed so hard to that!
Well Wayne, at least you are real. Too many people on YouTube are paying lip service saying wonderful things about products that suck because they got them from the PR dept. You are not one of those peole ! And a little bit of colourful language once in a while is OK!
LMFAO. "um ya know.. FUCKIN" hahahah!!! Hilarious.
My favorite part" "fuck!" hahahaha loved it!
LOL WTH???? I can't stop laughing!
I got nervous for you when it seemed like you got a little flustered. Ha! Thanks for the technique tips!
brilliant tips thanks!
lol!
hahah so sweet at 3:32
Hi Wayne - how do you feel about using the Kim K. method for older ladies with lines & crows feet? Does that method accentuate those lines? Thanks so much - Becky
Yay! Great vid! :-) xoxo
:)) thanks for the "fuckin' " tips!
NICEEEEEEE
haha blooper time was epic! Informative and to the point as usual!
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHA 3:32 HAHAHAHAH
I love your techniques, if only I could pull them off so well on myself! I always have the hardest time with concealer for some reason!
Lololololol at the swear hahha i dnt mind it wayne do ur thaaaang 3 3 3
Awesome as usually. I love the blooper. Lol
Your videos are lovely.  I find them very easy to follow.  I have dark circles so this is particularly important for me.
Great background. Love the blooper! ;)
i really like this background actually!
I love your videos, they are very interesting and helpful, but just some constructive criticism: You should do a short theme song in the beginning and use the subscribe bit at the end of the video. To me it just seems a bit awkward the way it is. :/
PLEASE HELP!! I HAVE DARK CIRCLES LIKE THEY ARE DARK BROWN. KUZ OF MY GENES. WHAT COLOR CORRECTOR SHOULD I USE??
cool background!!!
I love you!  You' re so bubbly and straight to the point. Great video.
ajajajaja i love ur blooper
thaaaaanks Kisses from Panama
Omg i would LOVE you to do my make up!
I love the stippling ideaxxx
Love your videos! Great tips!
I love it! You are great at explaining and demonstrating these methods i love all your videos! Thank you for all your time and effort:)
Great video! And funny ;)
Just the video i needed! thanks Goss!
thank you so much for sharing, I will definitely try those methods.
Your eyes look different in this video, maybe it's because of the background or lightning. Anyway, I have a huge crush on you;))) Thanks for the amazing tips!
I didn't get which way is the right one for me except for the one when I want to look like Kim Kardashian.  Great video though..
@Ridaa96 No he's not. He talk about his ring in a video maybe about 8 months ago :)
3:29 - I died, too funny.
abhahaahahah im still laughing from the f word
I <3 you
Thank uuuuuu!!!! Loved first method quick yet effective
you are a very profesional! love you!
he's married :O aww 7:19
do you think the clinique redness solutions compact or loose powder (the yellow-y one) is good for people with lots of redness?
look at the camera please
what a great great video!!!! love it :) quick question do u concealer after u put ur foundation on??or before?? ty :)
Lol fuck it!
Again THANKYOU!
Pls tell me how to avoid concealer from settling between the lines under the eye? I have tried loose powder but doesn't help.I have tried putting less concealer but that doesn't work too.Please tell me a way.I know u r a genious.This was a great video.
OMG, I've just tested the method with the wet sponge !! It worked perfectly!!! You have no idea how I'M happy. I have dark skin as well as heavy  greyish under eye circles and up until now  the concealers I have that could cover them looked really havy, artificial and enhanced my fine lines. But the wet sponge gives the perfect natural texture. :D Thank you so much for sharing this simple yet effective tip. Kisses from Brazil! ;)
Oh, new background. Me likey :)  And he video - just awesome! :) Thank you!
some people would have taken the video down right away. but who cares everybody messes up great video the stippling brush method was amazing!
hhahahahahah "fuck it"
Can you please do a vid like this for acne and blemishes?
Is any of these methods particularly good for preventing the concealer to accentuate lines under the eyes?
lol you got real mad! x
poor thing, you got so nervous at 3:32. good tutorial :)
Is He Gay???? Im NOT Trying To Be Ignorant And I Am Such A Big Fan Of Him...I Was Just Wondering For THe Longest..
This is amazing! I love that you actually tell and teach us these tips and tricks!
i love this video, thank you so much for this !! i've been having a bit of trouble with my concealer, i use mac select cover up but towards the end of the day it really dries out underneath my eyes and it does not look good. would you happen to know of a moisturising concealer i could use ?
Great video  !!!  OMG I started  cracking up so hard at 3:30 !! Your face spoke a million words lol.   Your a great one tho !!! Great video!  You should show some bloopers = )   Your so well liked !!!
These methods are very original and useful! Thanks!
3:30 *thumbs up* and your advices :)
your tips are def the most useful and innovative on youtube!! not obvious like: "1: blend with brush. 2:blend with finger" ect. do you wear makeup on a daily basis?
heheheh the way you say "taupe" & "taught"   :))
I have been putting concealer under my eye for ever and I do it to all my clients but I just recently heard you shouldn't because apparently it ages you. Can you please explain why people are saying this?
Brilliant just brilliant! Would you ever consider revealing a bit of your personal life? Family, partners, pets, house tour, day-in-the-life?  That would be awesome!
I find that everytime I use a warm concealer under my eyes to counteract the discoloration it always looks much darker than my foundation and you can tell where I've applied the concealer, my skin is so yellow that a warm colour never seems to look right, and if I use a yellow colour my undereye looks grey, what should I do :(
good white background! :-)
This was very, very helpful, I didn't know about the wet sponge/ dry sponge thing!!
Anyone else get the feeling that he probably smells really nice too? o-o"
I LOVE YOU! :)
In which EU webshop can we find this Makeup Atelier Paris Concealer/Corrector palettes?
Happy birthday  Didn't like the bloopers though :(
ITs like u read my mind sometimes. just thinking in buying some concealer for the 1st time and im a bit lost. this answered all my questions thank you :-P
Any chance you will be holding any classes??
loved this vid :) unfortunately i still haven't found the correct concealer for my skin tone but i hope that i soon will. maybe make up atelier?! :)
lmao amazing as always
I have the same problem! It sets in my fine lines under the eyes... How do I prevent that?
happy birthday :)
really like this !! i always have problem with concealing. you're being helpful ! xo
How do keep concealer from settling into under eye fine lines?
Thank you so much, this was extremely helpful considering I have genetic dark circles. xoxo
@pinkyluv310 you can try to use the mac full coverage it pretty much covers everything or   if it bothers u that much maybe u should look into a more permanent solution smth like   Radio Frequency Mole Removal its painless and no scaring x
Juste amazing !! I will try it tomorrow !
Hey Goss, I have pretty oily skin, any foundation suggestions? Something not too expensive! Also I am super pale! :(
I love  youuuuuuuuuu :))
@chocolatepockyluv Dammit! Lol.
You can mess up or say "fuck" as many times as you want but you're still gorgeous and still full of talent!! <3
im curious wayne, do you ever watch other gurus and think, "god youre doing it completely wrong!" or do you see some that are actually helpful? not that you need it because you know everything.(:

Hi, looking for a bit of advice.  I always find my concealer starts to look a bit cakey later in the day.  Looks flawless when I leave the house then dries out.  How can I stop this from happening?  Thanks and chortled at the blooper. PS -  I apply with a stippling brush already, discovered by accident when I couldn't be bothered dirtying another brush!

I loved this!!!

Goss!! Please please help me. I have a mole on my forehead that I always want to conceal, but it seems that whatever i do I can't conceal it! I just don't know what to do. Can you please make a video on how to conceal moles??
you should just keep your videos unedited, that was so funny :) though, you are on of the most informative makeup artist on youtube - I could literally become a makeup artist just from watching your videos. thank you for sharing

Great tips as always, thank you for being there. You are the best teacher I've ever had!   Oh and the swearing...god you cracked me up. I suppose you didn't mean to leave it there?
