Very 😍Cute!
Hi.. I love your work. And also I would like to know what kind of liquid glue and 2face tape are you using in this video and where can I find it? (Online or store) . God bless you.
What name brand of glue is that?
Oh! I love these! My daughter is getting married next year and we've been looking for something to make to put slices of wedding cake into that the guests could keep - this is brilliant!
Where do you find your magnets? I need some badly.

How big are these bags? Can you make them bigger?
Why is it that no one ever gives measurements? Folks wluld love to know what the finished sjze is expected to be!!
Does anyone know how to make the mechanism that pulls down from a “waterfall” and pops them all up?
Amazing!
Making these for my Breakfast at Tiffany’s loaded purse swap!
Super cute i want to try out myself. I always have to laugh at your jokes
Would you try to make a purse like that but push the side panels and increase them so instead of sticking out their folder then I just like to see what it looks like. May May you can do anything
those purses are precious
I loved your tutorial. Purse is so cute. Tfs. God bless.
Now I need a scoring board thing... didn’t even know it existed haha

What paper weight do you use on your purses?
Great video! Thanks for sharing.
💕💗💕👛
Hello, may I ask where do you usually buy those materials? like the papers and the tools. thanks!
I have spent hours watching your videos over this past weekend and I love them all. Can you tell me the size of the magnetics you have used here on this purse? Also where you purchased them from.  Perhaps you can carry these in your shop. Thanks in advance.
I BELIEVE I'M BOLD ENOUGH TO TRY THIS NOW. THANK YOU!!
Thank you so much for this tutorial, you gave excellent instructions, and now I can't stop making these little cuties. Love it, love it! Thank you again.
Are you cutting on the score lines?
Hello i speak spanish but what is the name for glue and stamp the purse is beautifull thanks
This is an excellent tutorial.  I enjoyed watching this video.  Your instructions were clear and concise.  I plan to make a paper purse today!  Thank you.
so good
what kind of glue were you using ? and how does the other one stay closed.  Thanks
Just ordered the stamp set! Like, two minutes ago. I'm going to check my mailbox now to see if it's miracled itself in there yet. Haha! Can't wait till it gets here because I love that zebra print cross, too!
what is the dimensions of the flap?
Charming!
I love this idea. I finally got my scrapbooking tools and started to work. This video inspired me.
Just beautiful. Thank you for sharing with us May May! Perfect for many things. Including giving a gift of a few cards in it!
Thanks so much for this tutorial.  I am going to use to design bags for my Granddaughter's teachers for end of year thank you gifts.
It would help to the completed item in the corner ❣️. Love you videos ❣️🌷❤️🌷
This is great !! How awesome!! Thank You
I do not get the cutting part I do not know where to cut.
I like your direction. I want to make a purse but I get lost when you cut the paper where do you cut. Would send me directions on where to cut the paper. My email is emailruthlang@gmail.com thank you.
After you score the paper then you fold down the paper where do you cut the paper is it on the 11-1/2 inch.
What brand sticky tape do you use?  I've been having problems with these projects falling apart. The next morning my basket's strips popped off. 😔 Love your videos.
Love these small purses.  TFS
ADORABLE!
Thank you for this great purse and your awesome videos! You're amazing!!!

I love this little bag. going to have to make some this weekend. TFS
Wow!Absolutely Adorable 😊
I LOVE watching your videos! You are AMAZING!
I'm so frustrated I can't get the darn measurement right it looks nothing like urs :-(
Thank you so much Maymay.  What a fabulous bag and so easy to do from one sheet paper.  Love it xx
I don't have the scoreboard. Would this work if I used a sharp point and ruler to make the indentations?
Adorable!
hi maymay, I have a ton of 12x12 paper I'd like to use up so this was perfect! Only thing is I'd like to fill them with something but the only thing I can think of is card sets to match. I've tried my hand at making cards from scratch but find my cards come out to plain, plus I'm horrible at embellishing. Do you have any other suggestions besides adding candy or cards?

Maymay, I have always wanted to make paper purses, but they always looked so difficult.  You have made it easy for me, so I am going to make some for the holidays for my friends.  Thanks a lot for sharing!!!
oh gosh so wonderful I wonder who can make me some like this one for me & my bible study group? they are just too Amazing, I'm not very crafty so I couldn't lol
Hello, I just love the bag idea they're lovely and cute. Please can you tell me the size of the piece you used in the red handle bag for the closure. Thank
Just a quick ? How would you mail this?
As a newbie to this art form I don't have all the "fancy" tools yet, I appreciate this tutorial and your thoughtfulness to show I can create such beautiful creations without all the bells and whistles!
By far my favorite crafting tutorial on YT. Using one full sheet of 12x12 and not a lot of gadgets. Simple and fun. I would be making lots of this for sure. Thanks for showing and sharing your talent! Hugs :)
I just tried to watch someone else make a purse and there were so many goofs, I had to come back and watch yours again to calm my nerves.
i've been having so much fun making these bags... i love designing different bags!   i'm gonna post pics on the facebook page this week....   they are so addicting!
OK, Maymay,  I'm just seeing these for the first time....can you tell me what you would use a paper purse for?????   Bev White
I love all your video tutorials.   Thank you so much!!!
I love this bag! I love that cross stamp. I think it would look amazing if it was embossed.
Where did you purchase the magnets for the closure of the purse?
Super Cute! I made 2 papaer purses tonight! Thank you so much for the wonderful tutorial!! xoxo
Hi Maymay, I  watched your video, and I think I will try to make these little purses. From the way you did the tutorial it looks easy. I love your work.  Thanks for sharing!

Hi Maymay,     This purse is just too stinkin cute! I love all of them. I make cards for Ronald McDonald Houses and this is just a great way to put them out for use.

you are amazing...thank you so much for the tutorial. can't wait to try and make them.
I really enjoy your tutorials, however the purse you showed had a different closure than what you showed on your video. I am looking for the dimensions on the wide closure that you corner round and covers the top. Thanks!
Thanks I'm os going to tell to make them can you make them small?
Thank you so much 😇
praises.. you made this so easy.. I have made 3 so far.. loving that stamp.. it's on my wish list!!-deb..
Love this! Thanks Maymay!
I am not crafty and was able to make this purse! Thank you!!!
OMG You made look so simple and easy to make. Thank you for the inspiration and tutorials. They both are super cute! Love ya Blessings Lady LaKreiasha❤
Hi maymay where can I find good cardstock? Love your videos and I'm considering joining the stamp club the stamps are beautiful and reasonably priced. God Bless you always!!!!😇🙏🏾
Oh Maymay, I've missed you so much!!  I've been watching YouTubes from all the things I have purchased from the UK.  They seem to have a different way of crafting.  I'm still going to the Dr every week, but I sure did need to hear somebody talk like me.  Can you believe those accents?  They think we have the accent....WHAT?????  I have some of the Anna Griffin Fantastic Flip Cards.  I'm usually very good at crafting anything, but these have me flabbergasted.  If you don't mind, I would like to send you a few and let you see if I'm doing something wrong. If you don't want them it's OK, but you're the only one I know who can give me an idea of how these should be done.  I REALLY HAVE MISSED YOU!!!
Love it! Thank you so much for sharing this tutorial! I can't wait to make one! By the way, your interactive  stamp set is awesome! I bought one for myself, and another one to share. Big hug!
Mayday: Your tutorials are always well done and easy to follow., Thanks for giving us your time
Your purses are beautiful!  I just got the cricut air after my sister made me a purse gift bag, but I can wait to try yours!  On a side note, I saw your address and my other sister lives in Clanton...what are the odds?
