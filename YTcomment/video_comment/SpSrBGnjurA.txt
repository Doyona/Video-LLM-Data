Mashallah tabarakallah 👍👍👍
Thanks for the recipe
I love this video I watched it when it was 2023 and still enjoy learning the same recipe over and over
👑 you dropped this, King. (It’s a crown if you see this on PC)
Tysm bro I’m gonna make them tomorrow in the morning for my mom’s birthday
Who’s here in 2025
I grew up on these at my Gmas. She was German Saxon and called them glentitas. A very inexpensive comforting meal!🎉❤❤
Cottage cheese with cinnamon sugar.
You are horrible in the kitchen buddy
i have been making these for ages,this recipe never fails and always tastes amazing
Awesome video! I love cream cheese as a base, fruit and cinnamon & sugar. Topped with powdered sugar!
I love crepes with cottage cheese with strawberries, bananas or some other fruit
Thanks so much for this, you managed to make even me understand it!!
Thank you very much very easy. You explained it.
thank you, im gonna try this for my kids
Omg these were super good and easy! 1st time here and my kid loved them ❤
Thank you for the clear instructions as how to make crepes. I have never done them and thought it was difficult. But boy was I wrong! I made them and they came out perfect. It’s also a delicious recipe.

👍 Excellent recipe ❤

Easy recipe
2025
Thank you for your information. I've never made crepes before but they look easy they way you showed.  One point of order however: someday in the future we will all realize why seed oils and 'cooking oil' is not healthy for the human body... how it greatly exacerbates inflammation which is the bellwether of virtually all diseases. Olive, coconut or avocado oils are much safer choices. Anyway other than that point I will def try your recipe this Sunday afternoon. Thank you for sharing it.
What are the benifits of chilling it for an hour
2025 here, just made these for breakfast and they were amazing!!!!so easy, so tasty!!
Who's here in 2025 ?
Midnight craving this after I found whip cream in the fridge!! I will update   If I make this
I tried this recipe and it was delicious 😋 I added a bit of cinnamon and it was delicious 😋
This is one of the best crepes i made tysm😊
It has been 8 years and you still comment on videos thats crazy
always make REAL whip cream
Love the vid ! Can I store the batter if I don’t use it all? Or is it better to use it all right away
Lol😂 if only strawberries and bacon could go together
Thank you for sharing the video how to make crepe. This is what I made this morning for breakfast. Very delicious.
Can't wait 2 make these!
still here in 2025! I’ve been using this recipe for YEARS now! It’s never failed me and it’s gotten an insane amount of compliments. 🎉🎉
I appreciate this recipe!! I do recommend using!!💖💖
I love crepes, but I never knew how to make them. Now I can make them. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe! 🙏😊
I wrap farmer cheese/egg/cinnamon in my crepes. They’re blintzes and they’re absolutely extraordinarily delicious! But I hate making crepes, so I watched this video to try and find some tips to make them easier and faster. Thanks Matt!
First time searching for a crepe recipe and ur video was the first one I clicked on..gonna be trying it
Thank you so much for the recipe. I tried it and got really good crepes🎉
I've been using your recipe since 2020, Matt. Thank you for making it so simple!
Nice job Matt, thank you
I’ve been making crepes for over 60 years.  Yours turned out great.  I use a crepe pan, it’s easier for me.  I use lard not butter, since lard doesn’t burn or add color to the crepe.  I occasionally use the crepes for a lunch or dinner with different fillings, such as turkey, bacon, I don’t use vanilla.  When we have them for dessert, we sprinkle sugar and lemon on them.  My mom and grandmother loved them that way.   My favorite comfort food.
You are amazing I love your setup, everything every would have no special utensils or crazy complicated ingredients
Such a great recipe! Saving it forever ❤
Thank you, just found you now your stuck with me ❤😮
My crepe game was atrocious before this video. Now they're coming out perfect every time. Thanks so much for this ❤
Got hungry for crepes💔
Peanut butter😅
Can you do these with pancake mix?
I don't know why but my mother always fries them in a little oil. She puts melted butter over them before serving them. I think it has something to do with how quickly butter can burn in the pan.
Ppl in 2025
I just found your video because I'm planning to make one for my kid's school snack tomorrow. One question thou, can I make the batter at night, and cook it tomorrow morning?
Who’s here in 2025? ❤

Nutella crepes for the win 🎉
Fake
Hi there! Im super new to cooking (i just learned how to make eggs) and wanted to ask if you recommend using a bit of oil (like you did in the video) or melt butter and use that instead. Thank you!!
we grew up calling these dutch pancakes. we just add a little cinnamon with eggs, flour & milk and use a fork or whisk to mix. going to try your recipe, thanks! favorite way to eat, sprinkle a little granulated sugar on top and roll up,a little crunch with the soft crepe.
Whos here 2025
Hey man, i've been using this recipe for 7 years now. I make them for family parties. And everyone loves them. Thank you for this recipe!

Good crepe😊
simplest and fastest recipe i have seen so far and the texture is great, turned out amazing in just a couple of minutes as i had the sudden urge to eat crepes at the middle of the night.  I ran out of vanilla extract so added 1 tbsp of thin caramel syrup i had around instead, thought i did use less sugar to make up for it, and it was delicious.
Im making these right now!
I love really thin pancakes 🤤
Question... can you use pancake mix/waffle mix as substitute to the flour?
Hi Matt Thank you for the lessons My boyfriend sent me this link so thank you for the recipe

Thank you,  looks yummy  Can't wait to try this
I found your channel years ago when I was younger and first got into cooking, and today I decided to make some crepes and wondered who would have the easiest and most understandable recipe. Of course yours worked the best, thanks Matt😌🫶🏼
the evolved form of pancakes!
I used farmhouse on Boone for the sourdough crepe recipe but followed your video on technique. Thank you! Sometimes having a visual helps so much vs looking at a paper recipe. We have a lot of food allergies in the house so I can make these now without dairy or egg. The sourdough component helps with digestion. ❤
Hello, I was wondering if instead of the mixer you could just mix it with a spoon?
From SA Joburg. Great recipe. I need a recipe for onion and livers. I only use white sugar. Can this be replaced with honey. Hope to hear from you soon
Nutella!
Lot of milk. But you make a mean crepe. Yum.
I wish I was in 2029 already.
I follow your recipe each time my kids ask for crepes. They love it. Thank you 🙏

Me when I’ve been using the same crepe recipe for Christmas for 6 years and making it 7 years today 😁
He is still responding to comment 7 years later ! legendary
I just made this ❤❤❤❤ thank you it tasts great 👍😃
Can you possibly give me a recipe if we only want to do half of that or if I only want to make 4 crepe’s?  Thank you!
could you make pancakes with the same ingredients together?
That was like a tablespoon of salt😂😂😂
I have been using this recipe for years thank you so much it’s an amazing recipe ❤
thank you so much! I was going to surprise my mother by making crepes, but one quick question... what should I set the heat for cooking it
Thank you so much Matt! needed to learn this for an exam and this video really helped!!
So.... no milk... but i had iced vinilla coffee ..😅  Needless to say It WORKS!!
How is bro still replying to comments
You lost me at canola oil.
He moans like he's taking dicks deeper and deeper
I’m so happy I found this video it made it super easy to make! I’m a disaster in the kitchen and I did it!
I have to remove the clumps after mixing the wet and dry ingredients. Straining the mixture would be wasting alot. It would better to put the flour and eggs first and then the milk
he lost me at "classic Nutella". How is Nutella a classic at this day and age.
This recipe saved my class’ french food day
2024 🎉
AHHH THESE TURNED OUT AWESOME!!! THANK YOU SOO MUUCHHHHH >,< YOU'RE A LEGENDDD!!! 😽🙏🎀

I love your videos man!
We have a coffee shop in my town that has a breakfast crepe on the menu and it's one of the best things I've eaten all year. It has a lot of options, but I picked scrambled eggs, bacon, and cheddar cheese as the contents inside the crepe. Not at ALL healthy, but it was magnificently delicious. Maybe I can attempt to recreate it in some form, now that I have some idea of how crepes are made. Thanks for the recipe.
THANK YOU SOOO MUCHHHHHHHH! I’ve been trying to find a crepes recipe for years and this one has finally done it!
I’m here after seven years to lol hope it’s good I had to use coconut extract I hope it’s good

i love to eat crepes with raspberries, sugar and lemon!
Tried to make crepe for the first time (after seeing an advertisement of "instant crepe maker" which would add another bulk to the kitchen). Not considering buying that appliance anymore. Thanks for a simple yet amazing recipe!!!

RECIPE FOR THESE CREPES (the crepe only not the filling)  *In a large bowl add:* 2 eggs 1 and 1/2 cups of milk 1 teaspoon of oil, canola oil or vegetable oil (or you can melt 1 tablespoon of butter and pour it in as a substitute) *Blend together well* 1 cup of all purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon of salt *If you want a sweet crepe also add:* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar *If you would like savory add:* Another 1/2 teaspoon of salt *Blend/Mix together* *You can chill the batter for an hour if you'd like, it is not necessary though.*  *Cooking the crepes* Put some butter in the pan Use 1/4 cup or 1/4 ladle to pour When pouring your batter tilt the pan slightly and lift it off the heat Tilt the pan when the batter is in it so it spreads evenly  Put the pan back on the heat Give it a minute to cook you want the top to be dry Take a spatula after 1 minute and flip it over Let the other side be on the pan for 10-20 seconds  Flip it over and you should see little brown blotches like freckles  Put it on a plate *Repeat until you have no more batter or you can store the batter for up to 2 days*
I make this recipe every year for mother's day and now everyone in my family says they're my "famous" crepes thanks Matt!

You saved our breakfast Matt! Thank you 😊
Where i live we call them pannekoek which translates to pancake but the community is split between crepe(English) and pannekoek(Afrikaans) And the thicker pancakes 🥞(American) we call flat jacks.😅
Can I make this crepe with whole wheat?
Looks alit like tortillas hahaha
New subscriber! This is amazing, great, well explained recipe. I also love how you respond to your comments 👏🏼

Thank you for this recipe! Do you have any other sweet ones for afternoons? Would love to make one for my mom 😊
Do you have to sift the flour first?
If I don’t have vanilla extract can I just use sugar? Thanks for your time
My fav crepe is apples and brie
I am 15 with absolutely 0 cooking experience, but i was able to make them and impress my family, thank you so much 🔥🔥
I love this recipe I started a small business to have extra income coming in and let’s just say this recipe was a banger ! 🤩
Tysm! Doing them rn! 👍

Hello Matt, thanks very much for making this video. It's the 5th time I watched your straight to the point method of making delicious crepes. My gf loves them.

Amazing video thank you 🙏 👏
I’ve been thinking about making this for my gf on Valentine’s Day and if all goes well, I will come back and give an update
Thing is i dont have a pan like yours do you know how i can make it in a nother pan
Great recipe and super simple! I was always taught to let the batter set in the fridge covered over night? Does that make a difference? I've never just made the batter and cooked it before
Wow you’re a legend for responding to all of these also I just subbed
Was just trying to figure out what new food I could make my husband in the morning for breakfast? Something that I have not cooked before. Lucky for me, I found this video. I'm thinking I might do a sweet crepe but also a savory one.   What do you recommend filling the savory crepe with?
This looks easy enough to do. I’ll definitely be doing this soon! Thank you!
Even after blending my batter still looks lumpy, what should I do?
My wife said she was craving crepes and I told her that I know how to make them… so here I am about to make crepes 😅
Why do people say put it in yhe fridge for an hour?
do i need to add butter for every creps?
These were actually so good tysm for the recipe!! I will definitely make them again
Bro be my dad please?🙏🏽
I like how it turn out on the crepe maker
Whos here in 2024

You had me till you started edging to strawberries
Hi loved the video
I’m about to make crepes with my gf, I’m gonna pretend to know what I’m doing. Thanks for the tips lol
Can you post a video on how to make tteokbokki korean rice cakes please? Please 😅
This is a gem! I’ve been looking this kind of crepe fluffy and delicate just like the crepe I ate at Alexa’s Creperie in Hotsprings, Arkansas
Perfect recipe … came out delicious
Amazing recipe, I cooked this for my mum on her birthday and she absolutely loved it. 5 out of 5 stars would try again.
I’ve never made a crepe. This video is short sweet and to the point!! With simple ingredients. Love this , thank you !!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ***followed***
Me and my mum love ur cooking! I honestly think u are better than Gordon Ramsey because ur so so kind and humble. Plus ur recipes are so so SOOO Delicious!!! Thank you for your delicious recipes kind regards - @marnassar1364😊❤
The reason i subcribed is because i saw a comment where it said you replied to a comment after all these years, and i checked and its correct! Youre a legend.
I don’t have any flour, can I use pancake mix?
wait can I still add sugar without the vanilla extract?
Just did it and it came out incredible thank you so much
My fiance loves me more thanks to you❤ Happy New Year 🎉
Thank you so much! There is a crepe stand where I live, but it is sooo expensive lol! I'll make these for my friends...
hi‼️‼️i know this is an old video but i’m still going to leave a comment: I followed your recipe to make a mille crepe cake for my mom’s birthday. I did have difficulty following instructions as i wasn’t the best around the kitchen (especially with handheld mixers!) but in the end, the cake was one that I actually enjoyed eating. my mom’s a professional pastry chef and though she did offer a lot of criticism, she said the crepe itself was good and she finished her whole slice‼️‼️ I’m going to continue perfecting my craft in crepe cakes using your recipe, and hopefully i end up something even better for her next year💕
Would non stick spray on a regular skillet work in place of the non stick skillet? Im new to all this 😅
Thank you💯🍻
So easy and delicious as your video makes it look easy it becomes an easy thank you. Happy New Year to an amazing 2024 for you and your family

Just asking, roughly how many cups of batter do your pour to make a crepe on a 25 centimetres frying pan.
2 eggs,  1 & 1/2 cup milk, 1sp oil, 1 cup flour, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar

This is so amazing and delicious! Love this recipe and it’s SO easy to make! I made it for my family and everyone loved it, next time I want to make crepes I’m gonna be using this video
I think it is pronounced “Nut tella” not “New tella”. Pretty sure it’s because the primary ingredient is Hazelnuts. Great recipe. Thank you for sharing it.
this recipe works every single time, most recipes the crepe turns thick and pancake-like but this one is perfect and i come back everytime !
Even though it’s been 6 years he still reply’s. Anyway this is the best recipe I love it
I’ve never made these, now I’m gonna try for the first time! They look so good!! Thanks for the easy tutorial lol

Loved your video! Do you think crepes would be practical for a food truck? I’m thinking sweet and savory? Should I get a special crepe pan? Do you warm the premade crepes before filling?
Here I am because I forgot how to make them a long time ago 😅
Well, I made your crepes in the blender and with the sugar and vanilla for the first time. Great! The blender made perfectly smooth batter, zero lumps!  Nutella, of course!
Thank you.
Could you still reply to my comment even though its been 6 years

Perfect recipe I'm going to make an Anabolic version
I've always wanted to try crepes and you really do make it so accessible. I also like that you have an electric stove (like me). I'd love a gas stove but it's nice to see they come out just as well. Thanks, Matt.
you should try lemon and sugar crepe
My mom loves crepes but we never get it right I hope I can make this for her to take for lunch today   I'm gonna try it now
I just know about crepes I just watched  young couple YouTube channel and It makes me  interested to know what more ingredients to make crepes and I found this channel. Thank you for sharing for sure I'll make crepes today.

Hi
What about 6 years 👋🫢
whats better guys a savory crepe or a sweet one?
Thanks to this man,and his tutorials.
But does he do it after 6 years
Hi
I have tried this recipe since I moved to a new house, I was 8 and I still come back to this video and it holds the title: GREATEST CREPE IN THE WORLD!!! (and yes, much better than hotel crepes)
I made them yesterday and I really love how so I will make more today
Nice and easy
I love how they come out
Mine were kinda thick😢
Does it matter when pouring the crepe batter if I use oil or butter, or is it just personal preference?
My go-to breakfast joint removed nutella crepes from the menu! I'm excited to try this recipe for breakfast-dinner tonight. Thank you for sharing your methods!
Can I leave the  leftover mix in the refrigerator for later use?
I woke up craving crepes, turned out amazing! Thank you
I tried the recipe it’s sooo good it’s definitely worth 5 stars🎉
Decided to make crepes for fathers day and they were delicious, thank you for the recipe
This is so good thank you
I just went to Mexico a few weeks ago and the place I stayed at had a big buffet with AMAZING crepes. Our last day there at the resort I told my mom, dad, and brother that I wanted to get a crepe at lunch because I forgot to get one at breakfast. We didn’t go to the buffet at lunch so I couldn’t get the crepe which I was really disappointed and sad because they were the best crepes I have ever had and I’m not even joking. I just got back to my house around a week ago. I kept on craving crepes since I didn’t get that one the last day. Today for breakfast when I was making eggs and remembered that I could make crepes. I looked up a recipe and this was the first one that popped up. I made these crepes and it made 7 crepes. Me, my mom, and my brother each had a crepe. I didn’t know if they were going to be good since I made them all by my self. We topped them with Nutella, peanut butter (my mom and brother had the peanut butter but I didn’t), strawberries chunks, mango chunks, and cinnamon and sugar. Let me tell you these crepes are literally AMAZING!! They are even better than the ones in Mexico!! I am definitely saving this recipe for next time I want to make crepes. I would 10/10 recommend this recipe to anyone who likes or loves crepes!! I would rate these crepes 1000000000/10! Thank you so much for this recipe, me and my family definitely enjoyed  these crepes today and I will make them for my friends soon too! Thank you!!
Will this man reply to comments now ? Anyways i gonna try this when get home from vacay
A Romeo and Juliette (Strawberry, Banana, and Nutella) is the way to go!   Sometimes, I also enjoy a simple “sugar crepe” (crepe with cane or brown sugar or cinnamon).   Aloha 😊🤙🏼👏🏼
Ty. I’m gonna do this later because I’m scared because my whole family is there.
Hi I’m a big fan
This recipe is the best!
It works… I tried it. They turned out great!
Wow this turned out SOO GOOD
Thank you so much for sharing your amazing technique. They turned out really good.
Made this while my neighbors were having a divorce…..
Not me being lazY and watching this video after.   6 years
I love it ❤❤❤
Do you have to use all purpose flour?
I just used this recipe successfully 😎 and now I'm gonna make a crepe cake for dessert. Thanks Matt!
Does he reply after 6 years?
Best crepes
I just made these for breakfast for my kids, for the first time, and they were absolutely delicious! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe it was a game changer for breakfast this morning 🙌🏼
Thank you so much for this video, and at the end for showing us how to top it off. Im going to try and make this today :)
Is the milk supposed to be cold. Just curious.
What should the flame be on low or medium
Best crepes I’ve had! No flops
Great video! My wife loves crepes and usually makes them. But I was able to surprise her this morning with some thanks to this vid! She loved them too. I did the Nutella with strawberries and top it with whip cream
My friend, always looking for a simple crepe recipe and you did a great job of making the best one. What I'm about to say is meant to help you not to criticize you. The noise in the background is infuriating. It insults the intelligence of The Listener to impose this I can only think creators believe we need to be overwhelmed with stimulus and entertained every second are we will click away. It really really detract from my concentration and annoys me. I wanted to scream by the time I had the information I came here looking for.
I like this video it’s so simple but so yummy.
I like the roll method matt, thanks for the video, my girlfriend will love this recipe!
L love your videos 😊
I love your recipe, i work in a breakfast restaurant like 12 years ago in wisconsin and i loved the recipe they have and i tried yours and is wonderful too. I did your recipe here in Mexico and my wife and kids were satisfied with your recipe. Thank you .
Just made some cause I really want to try strawberry crepe. So overall looks of the food 7/10 The execution of the taste 1/10 Very salty, highly dont recommend my cooking. I think the biggest problem I did was that I added way too much salt and butter. But Im willing to make it again! I will not lose my confidence >:D
If i can do it you can do it attitude, i love it. Those look very nice ill try to make them once im home 🙂
Just made these for breakfast today. Terrific recipe-thank you!
Nice video and thank you for providing this useful video
Whenever you mixed the batter all together with the electric mixer it was lumpy because you didn’t use a blender. When I used a blender it was nice and smooth. Good video!
I watched this video few years ago for my first time making crepes and whenever I crave for crepes, I ALWAYS come back to ur video. Absolutely on point and easy to make! And now I'm watching it again to make it. THANK YOU A LOT
i subscribes just for how awesome you are i scrolled for 5 minutes trying to find a comment you didn’t reply to and couldn’t my fingers literally hurt and the fact that there is 7 thousand comments is even more crazy and you posted this video 6 years ago and your still responding to people i do have a little question tho instead of blending the mixture can you mix with your hands with a fork maybe
Tart and Quiche
Just tried this recipe. Tasted great. Thank you so much🙏☺️
I was wanting crepe so bad , I love it
I successfully made my first ever Crepes for Mother’s Day using your video for the recipe and how to cook them.  They turned out great!  Thanks.

Thsi is seriously my fav
Wowww what a word man❤️❤️If i can do it you can do it❤️❤️🔥🔥
It’s worked perfectly once I tried.🙏🙏🙏🙏🤝🙏
THESE CRAPES ARE SOO GOOD!!👍👍
May i have the ingredients list
I’ve been using your crepe recipe for 2 years now and I love it😊🌸🌷
I've always used this recipe when making crepes❤. But I use maple syrup instead of vanilla extract, I find it more affective for sweet crepes. 😊
Its been 6 years, do you still reply to comments?
Matt I have been making these crepes 1-2 up to 3 times a week my kids loves it even me 😊❤
Does he respond after 6 years?
Dor
The best crepes I’ve ever made
These look so good making it for when i break my fast
Would lactate milk work instead of regular? This recipe is amazing
Making it now😄😄😄
How much crepes does this recipe make?
I’m going outside the box tomorrow morning , Making a Bacon and cream cheese crepe with a homemade Blueberry Jalapeño purée
His happiness is quite contagious 😂
I made my mom proud with this recipe. Thank You!
THESE WERE AWESOME!! As a starter cook I know a few recipes but I adore crepes!! I love this recipe very much!! It was fantastic!! My mom and sister loved it as well!! Saving this recipe and making it again soon!!😃😎✌️
Nutella is my favorite!! Thank you
We like to roll up a spoonful of cottage cheese in ours 😋
Lets find out if he will still reply
Great recipes
Great vid!
1/2 cups of milk  1 teaspoon of oil  2 eggs  *Blend it together* 1 cup of all purpose flour  1/4 teaspoon of salt  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  1 tablespoon of granulated sugar   Thank you
Hello Matt, I'm going to try this recipe soon but I want make sure that the salt amount is correct. I'm making a smaller serving, and in the video you mentioned 1/4 teaspoon salt. It looks like a larger measurement in the video to me, more like a 1/4 tablespoon.
Can you use almond flour and almond milk substitute for the milk and regular flour?
Currently trying to learn how to make crepes at home after I recently learned I love them. So far my attempts are god awful.👍
How long can we save the batter for?
Just made these and there so good
I cant wait to make this 😍😍😍😍
Can u use water as a substitute to milk?
does he still respond to comments after 6 years?
Top it off  with cottage cheese and sugar or cherry 🍒  or poppy seeds with sugar
The easiest recipe ever 😭 thank you🙃🙃🙃
-2 eggs -One and a half cups milk  -One teaspoon oil/ butter -One cup flour  -1/4 teaspoon salt  -1 teaspoon vanilla extract  -1 tablespoon sugar
Thank you so much for showing me how to make it came out so good had to get the right frame pan😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love the recipe very good crepes
thank you so much for this video im gonna try to make a crepe today!!
Did this guy actually respond to 6.9k comments?
Thank you so much.  I just surprise my boyfriend with a special breakfast.
This is the best recipe yet:)
How much servings does it make?
These look so delicious! I want to make this for my family for breakfast, but how much does this batch shown make? There'll be 4 adults eating and 1 toddler.  Guess I'm trying to see if this is enough to make 13 crepes😅
6,986 comments.   Do they all have a response from Matt?  Absolutely mind blowing.
🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓STRAWBERRYSSS🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓
does coconut sugar work? 🤔
1 1/2 c milk   2 eggs 1 table spoon canola oil  1 tsp vanilla extract  1 tbsp sugar  1 cup flour   (Mix wet ingredients before adding dry)
Thanks for sharing this, Matt❤️❤️
Who you got a new follower
So glad I found this! I am going to attempt to make a crepe cake today but have never made a crepe in my life. My mom is like the crepe master so hoping some of those genes dwindled down to me lol I’m pretty good at making cakes just never made a crepe cake but I’m excited to try. Thank you for showing us step by step! That is very helpful
Legend says he still replies to comments 5 years later
👍👍✌️✌️ great self service...
Very informative video, I will use this to make crepes for my mom's birthday!
Great recipe! Could i make the batter and leave it in the fridge overnight to make the next morning?
Wow, thank you!!! So easy! 😅
I’m actually here looking how to make crepes for my boys 😅
i have done them ever since i found this video my kids love it 😊
Quick & simple.  I like your recipe
Tysm was delicious
This guy is the goat of crepes
I’m so trying this today!!, after 5 year let’s see how this goes
Thanks for a well done video.  The hand mixer at the beginning-- sitting on the counter without its beaters, reminds me of my cat when she parks herself with her paws tucked underneath. Hahaha! I have recently discovered that crepes make great lasagna noodles for a small round lasagna baked in a pan or pie plate. I'm now on the lookout for a pan to make 4" mini crepes so I can make individual lasagnas in ramekins.
So basically a thin open omelet?
Thanks for sharing your recipe 😊
It's a Wonderful food for the whole family
I am thinking of using this recipe... but only have plain or self raising flour! Please help and reply!
So I looked up the recipe and there are no measurements. I had to watch the video. That’s a little sneaky
They look amazing god
Thank you
U r the best ♡
I use this recipe everytime for crepes. I just made them this morning and they're so good! 😋
Can I leave the mixture in the fridge overnight?
Thank youu for the recipe!!
I have a recipe written in French by my grandmother and she used water! I’m super skeptical so if it doesn’t turn out I will use this recipe, thank you!
Muchas gracias muy buena receta. Me quedaron exelentes
Thx sur for this good recipe
The fact that you get time to reply to each and everyone really makes you unique.... tried your recipe and so far it's the best.
Does the goat respond after 5 years?
I'm eating the crepes as I'm typing this and they are delicious! Thanks for the recipe! :)
Unlike standard pancakes like from the box, do you have to have a blender to do crepes? I'm new to cooking by myself but I really enjoy the swedish crepes at IHOP and I thought well hell maybe there's a way even a kitchen klutz me like me might be able to do 🤣
How long should you mix ingredients
🌺🌻🌷🌱🌸
Very well explained !! Thanks 🌷🌱
Is the stove temp is it on medium or on high?
This is my go-to recipe for crepes.
I loved ur video thank u. Please make more
Thank you for sharing your recipe! Guess who loved it besides my grown ups? My grandchildren  (2 and 4 years old) . We had them with Mexican caramel and my homemade blueberry marmalade … YUM!! DeLish!😊
It's been 5 years now..... let's see if he's still replying 😏
Whip cream and maple syrup is my favourite
What a legend
Good crepe recipe
I subscribed because of this video. I dig it.
Does the legend still respond?
You made these so simple and easy...yum
ive always loved making crepes and i was taught by my great grandma and i never knew that you could add salt this entire time qhen i saw that it blew my mind lmfao
Uhmm i will try this i dont know how to cook but this seems easy
Looks great! So do we need to oil in between each one..I noticed you only oiled for first one. Will the others not stick after first one on a mon stick skillet?
So simple to make and delicious !!!❤️
Does it cook on low to mid flame??
I'll try it soon IA
The whole milk 🥛 tastes better. & I think a lot of butter 🧈 would make it taste better too
Try a savoury crepe with lamb and bell peppers….. 🤤
My friend and I come back to this video still after 5 years because we can never remember the recipe 😂 it hits just right every single time
Does it work if we don't use the vanilla extract too?
Thanks
I don’t know why, but I really like the idea and use of the side camera. Something different from the usual shots on other channels. Oh and my favourite way is folding them in half and stacking them with berries and it’s juice on top.
thank you so much for this recipe it’s delicious and i have been using it for years 👍👍
Is this the same way to do an egg pancake? Hi from Detroit Michigan 🚂
I had a dream that I was eating crepes
thanks for the recipe😘
It tastes soooooooooo good omg
Wow, wow wow, you are the best! Thank God.
first time making crepes 😅 want to ask if anybody has recommendations on what type of sauce you add on the crepes at end like is it chocolate syrup or nutella? super confused srry 😅
I'm making sweet crepes with ricotta cheese and slightly crushed, slightly sweetened blueberries  topped with a small dollop of whipped cream. YUM!
Now I want crepes lmao
Cinnamon on top, or farmer's cheese mixed with sugar and lemon grind, yummy.
Thanks alot  It's v easy way  Will try soon
Can pancake mix substitute the flower ?
10/10 amazing crepes filled them with nutella and i could only just finish them both they cook extremely easily and fast i had no mess ups whatso
I hate this man
These look absolutely gorgeous Next time I make a nice breakfast for friends or family I’m going to do these
Great video, thanks, but that flip hurt
thank you so much this works, I’m surprised how easy it is
its been 5 yrs and this man still replies to comments hatsoff
I made crepes so many times and everyone loves it thank you ❤
T-swril crepe is my favor！
5:42 had me dying LMAO
Can we just get the receipt in the comments too?
Thank you for this recipe! I tried it yesterday and it was very easy to follow along.
I first discovered Nutella in the 90's at Crepes A GO-GO in the town I moved to for a bit.  WOW!  Then I moved North, we had Shari's, they do a fruit offering, I THINK powdered sugar, but they do a vanilla glaze also, after the fruit is rolled in, I think you had your choice of berries, blueberries in a sauce, or (usually) fresh strawberries, vanilla filling of some sort, they rolled them, then powder sugar and a bit more glaze.  I never thought to ask for the recipe of the vanilla stuff, I just used to order mine with extra, or you could ask for whipped cream.  I used to order these year round, so whatever fruit they had during off season was your choices... but it's always the perfect snack, not too much, not too heavy, always good with coffee!  You're quite talented with the flipping part there!  😎I'm going to have to find out if it's easier than it looks, before I say any more!  Thank you.
these are amazing!!!!!! thank you!!
Did you put the four?
Looks delicious and easy thanks chef
Thank you so much this helped me sooo much ❤
I tried this out today  It taste so good 😊
I love this tutorial
I just did your recipe and my little family loved it 🥰. Thank you so much for taking the time to show us your way. Very delicious.

I’ve never had a crepe but I woke up craving them. This seems simple enough— THANK YOUUUU🎉❤
i watched this video 4 years ago but whenever i make crepes i ALWAYS come back to this video. Literally the best recipe!!!
Tried these and they were delicious and so simple to make! I always thought crepes would be too difficult but the instructions were super clear and worked well!
Tried it today and they worked great. I did have to double the recipe to be able to feed all the kids 😊. The first two came out pretty terrible but after that they were great.
Hi Matt, is it one cup of flour because it seems to be much more ?
Matt frl the 🐐 I always use this video when making crepes
I am back again because I love crepes
I just shat my pants🥰🥰🥰🥰
Thank you for r the how-to....
Matt this is perfect for me & my family, i have never made them yet. I love crepes'......peach, apple, strawberry! thank you for this recipe.

We love this recipe! Thanks for sharing!
Short n simple to the point video ! Thank you for sharing.
Those crepes look so delicious! Thank you for sharing this video.
Omg this crepes are the best, my first time I loved it. 🤤🤤🤤Thank you very much.
Thank you for the recipe 🥰
thank you Matt
😍🙌
You're the Bob Ross of Crepe making
why didn’t you keep buttering the pan before each crepe after the first?
i have to try this
Why is it different from a regular skillet and a "crepe skillet"?
Just made the recipe. Tastes great
This was just delicious
I tried this recipe in Cairo, Egypt 🇪🇬  and it happened to be amaazzzzing. This recipe is enough for almost dozen people. I used Nutella, bananas, and roasted almonds flakes. I used also savory crepes with cheese. Thank you Matt, very informative.
Only video I use n have to watch every time I make them 😂
just made these, fucking amazing!
Gumper gang or no gang
I made these and just sifted the flour beforehand.  I used my Vita Mix blender and had no lumps.  My daughter loves them.
How many crepes can I make with this recipe?
Hello Matt, I'm Naglaa from Egypt, thank you so much, I followed your recipe and do use all the time, it is accurate and delicious... just noticed it's been 5 years ago .. knowledge is never old.  Thanks again
i feel like i can put my hand through the screen and eat the crepes-😆🍓
Does he still respond after 5yrs?
Wow😮
This is so easy thank you I loved it
The pan must matter. I tried to make crapes from box (just add water) using an electric griddle. It was a totally fail. I couldn’t get one crape to cook properly. I tried different temps and used better but no success. Maybe it was the brand of box crapes.  Maybe I need to buy a good fry pan.
The best recipe I’ve ever used!
I made this but my stove top just kept getting hotter and when I added a small amount of butter on slightly passed medium heat it turned brown so fast, I need to get a grittle.
We had a crepe machine as a kid, we always just put some butter and a little sugar on them, rolled them up and ate them down. Thank you for the video
Looking for a crepe recipe as planning to cook my own… the crepe shop near me at the high street has extortionate prices that I cannot justify. Thank you for this recipe! You explained the steps really well and you encouraged me to try myself. Looking forward to trying this recipe of yours.
That batter looks very runny ?
Did you ever see strawberries with the juice in a crape my aunt used to make something like that when I was a kid and she put fresh homemade whipped cream with some sugar in it
Tried it and they were heavenly
Awesome video. As a guy who didn't grow up cooking this was extremely easy to follow! Thank you!
HOW ARE YOU STILL REPLYINGG
😀
It’s 2 a.m and I had a feeling that I wanted to eat crepes… that’s what I’m gonna do!😁
Thank you very helpful will be watching more of your vids as a new cook I find it hard to find videos that I can follow very helpful
making this with my dad for breakfast!!! love your recipe 🫶🏻
Hi, i really like ur recipe! I make this for my family every morning!
Pancakes and kids you always throw the first one away
Do you still respond to comments even after 5 years?
I like to use miracle whip🌚

U gonna respond after five years 😅
My go-to crepes recipe 😊 love it!
Lol it's been 5 years now but I'm gonna try to make crepes
I love this recipe. it tastes like heaven.
I've always wanted to learn how to make crepes. I make pancakes all the time but really want to achieve the thinness in of a crepe. Just wondering, do you use a tool to spread the batter around the pan after putting it in, or do you just tilt it and let it form itself? I'm totally blind so wouldn't have caught that detail in the video. Thanks for the recipe! :-)
Man ... you are savior thanx
I did that today
these look so good thanks matt!!
unfortunately, you did not specify how many crepe you get from your amounts, so I had to do to twice to get the number I need.
I have been so afraid of crepe-making since the 1st time they came out so bad, but i have hope now! Thank you for your amazing explanation.
Just made them.. turned out perfect. Thank you so much. Have a great week
I absolutely love your energy! I was wondering how to cook a crepe since I’m trying to cook some using my older sister’s recipe! Thank you for the lovely tutorial!
I made one with my older sister! It turned out so fluffy and soft! Me and my sister couldnt fold it, but we still savored all of it. Thank you so much.
Thank you,I love the way you do 👍
sieve flour before adding and a little at a time to prevent lumps forming
I will subscribe! Also I just did this recipe and my mom brother liked it :D they said maybe try adding strawberry sauce and I said ok. Bye the way my dad forgot to eat his
I need a list of ingredients lol

Hello Matt! Would this recipe work with Bisquick Pancake & Baking Mix?
Just checking if he is legitly replying to the comments.. 😎😎
This helped a lot thanks
I tried this recipe. It came out well, but they ended up a bit golden. They still tasted good.
First off I love your videos!! Could you please do one on cornmeal mush? I found a recipe for it and tried it but it didn't work out at all!!!! I will be looking forward to seeing if you can do it. Thanks again and keep the great recipes coming.
I like the technique you use for spreading the crepe evenly across the pan! I was putting it all in the middle and trying to swirl it around to varying degrees of success but the way you do it just makes sense. Thank you!
I always thought crepes were made from pancake mix lmao
My favorite video always go back to it and it never fails me thank you so much
What heat?

Looks yummy😋😋, thank you Matt!
Thank you! I will be using this recipe out. Im suddenly craving for crepes all of a sudden ~

Thanks for this wonderful crêpe recipe Matt! I love it 🥰
Wow soo easy😁😁😁😀😀
I can see that those sliced banana pieces were lying patiently in that glass bowl, waiting for their moment to shine... Only to be bypassed by a second layer of strawberries.
I like the Thai traditional way witch they got many varieties of and that's a plus.  It always turns out yummy, but I want bigger bc I eat them up in a minute
How can I make the crepes for 1kg of flour??  How many egg should I put??  The milk?  Veg oil??  Etc2..  I'll really appreciate it if Can you explain it in details..
Super easy recipe and very good! Made it tonight! Thanks!

Hey hi, can you make Pastel de nata . I am looking for an easy to understand recipe like your other videos. Thanks
My favorite way to eat them is with a little butter and lots of jelly just like my mom used to make them for me.  She used to make them with just one cup of flour, one cup of milk, and one egg, but I'm going to use your recipe next time.
Hehe^_^ I just made them and they are awesomee (◕ᴗ◕✿) thank you so much for this recipe (~‾▿‾)~ it was also pretty easy to make considering, how clear you make everything. Thanks~~~(◔‿◔)

Cup? How much is a cup? I have two different cups which take very different amounts, which would affect the thickness, is what I was about to post, but then I saw the description having all of that. Thank you so much!
hello, Matt,... I was just looking for an easy to follow recepi for crepes and found it in your video... Just a question, can you save the bater for later if you're making only 3 crepes? or it has to be used all right away?...
M
Thx best recipe I made for crêpes
My bb is requesting for crepes. So im tryin out your recipe.🤩
Have been using this for a year now 🙌🏻🤗 I love it
The English way:  Sprinkle sugar over the crepe, soak sugar with lemon juice by drizzling all over.  Roll up tightly. Enjoy.  Mmmmm.
Amazing
thanks for the recipe Ima try this for dinner (Idk why I just want crepes right now lol) I can't wait to try :)
Does he stil reply in 2022????

i dont have vanilla extract, is that okay?
Delicious
This is by FAR the best and easiest recipe I have tried of crepés EVER! Since I found this video (4 months ago) I have made crepés for my family and friends a good 70 times and it never fails! Getting the technique for pouring into the pan is the difficult part, the rest is a piece of cake. I do strain it so it leaves the crepés smooth! I LOVE IT! Thank you for sharing!!
I remember making this same recipe from this video a year ago and now I’m back doing it again cause I remember it tasted so good and fluffy
I love your inthusiasm
Quick question, can we make crepes w no eggs?

I’m making these as a surprise breakfast in bed for my mom. The filling will be 1 cup frozen strawberries, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 2 tablespoons sugar, and some pectin or gelatin. Then some freshly whipped cream. Thanks for such a quick and easy recipe!😀
I appreciate this very much. I plan on making this with my mom for mother's day with strawberries and chocolate and couldn't remember how to make them😄
This was a fool-proof recipe. Thank you so much
I'm doing this for Mother's Day Thank you so much! :)

I made these today for my grand daughter, the first time I ever made crepes and they turned out great! Easy quick recipe and she loved them. She chose the Nutella and bananas.  Thank you for posting this video, you made grandma look good! 💋
5 years later Im here. Looking this video. Ty ty ty Matt. I do it for my brother and me. Place some strawberries and banana with nutela and cream cheese inside. It was delicious ❤️😋No more buying creppes outside. Going to do my own. Try to mix the egg before adding everything. That way the creppes dont taste like egg
Does he respond after 5 years?
This was soo good and tasty 😋  I love this guy
Bro saved me for my cooking competition on Friday thank you good sir

Parisian French and most French dialects don't have a rhotic "R", so no Spanish/Italian/Portugues thrilled/rhotic "R".   Instead, it has a glottal "R" like German and Dutch.
I am gonna try this tonight bc I’m fasting for Ramadan🤤🤤

Thanks man u saved me from my f&N exam. Its the following day and its 1 am here
As a teenager I seem to recall having some crepes made with cottage cheese and jam inside? Is that really a thing or was the lady who made them winging it with what was on hand from the fridge? Either way, I do recall it was tasty! It was the first crepe I ever had at that point in my life.
I made it this morning and it tasted delicious
This is definitely the most delicious crepe I've ever made! 😍

If you were to make a larger batch, would you just double the amount for each ingredient?

Thank you! My family loved these, my mom was impressed since I almost  never cook.
Thanks for this video.
This helped me out a lot, thanks! 👍
Can I use bread flour?
Thank you very simple and perfect!!
Nice that we can just use a non-stick pan. Not that I need it, but I love how the recipe in your description includes the metric conversions too!  I know my flips won't be perfect either, so thanks for not editing your first attempt and showing that it will still work out.  I subbed!

Turns out I bought all the fill in ingredients and forgot the crepes!! 🤦🏻‍♀️ Thanks for Shia ring this simple recipe.. you’re a Christmas hero! 🎅🏼
It's easy to make and simple thank you for sharing the vedio God bless you
I love this recipe. My favorite way is lots of butter, lemon juice and powdered sugar.  And what if I want to make double the amount? Do I double the salt and vanilla too?
He made it so simple. Yummy!! ☺️
make this recipe all the time now, great tutorials with no extra time wasting, keep it up bro
I learnt making crepes from Matt. There was no stopping after I made for the first time

Tip: don’t wip the egg whites to make the crepe fluffy it will just make it taste like a really greasy omelet with chocolate on top so don’t change anything

Thank you for showing how to make it I’m so excited to do it☺️😁
I love the fact that you use a non stick skillet. You truly show how the home cook can make this without having to invest in single purpose equipment.  I look forward to trying this with my 5yr old!

I’ve been really craving crepes and I was trying to see an easy simple recipe. It’s night right now but I can’t wait to try it in the morning !

Ughhh this looks soooooo good
Can you substitute the dairy milk for a plant based milk
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!
how do i make these taste good with limited ingredients
I’m a crepe lover and I stared to learn how to cook recently 🙈 I tried your recipe and it tasted very good thank you 👍🏻👏🏻
Thanks dude! I made them the other day according to your instructions and they came out perfect. I didn't have anything to put in them, but still loved them.
I was wondering how you didn't get anxious when that first crape didn't flip easly 🍃
I must try this , so tempting
An easier recipe  1 cup plain flour / all purpose flour 2 cups milk /500 ml any cow milk 3 eggs beaten without shell.🤣 Mix milk and eggs together well add to flour mix with whisk. Combine sugar and vanilla essence if you want. 80ml or a 1/3rd measure cup is perfect for a 20cm crepe. No resting required  Makes 7-8 crepes
Thank u
I need to try this!!

Hi
Cinnamon sugar is the best crepe ever!
Awesome recipe. Great ingredients combination. I changed it a bit, turned out great. Separated the egg whites and yokes. Whipped the egg whites to soft peaks and folded in just before cooking. Light, fluffy, and super delicious. Thank you for your recipe.
I’m trying to make them for the first time in
It’s cool that you showed you messing up the flip, only because I know I do that all the time 😂
Looks cool,can you actually manage to accidentally burn it? Or break the crepe a little?
Thanks for recipe we tried it it’s so good😊

Can you use almond milk?
I just love the folding of the crepe. It looks sooooooooo nice and tastes to good with all kinds of chocolates like Kinder Bueno or something when its still fresh and hot X)  We usually get them in the winter... always so amazing. Gonna try them this weekend, kinda hyped XD
My favorite savory crepe is goat cheese, ham, cheese, spinach, and I have a few more toppings  My favorite sweet one is Nutella and strawberries
Tysm I have been using this recipe for 3 years

I’ve really gotten into cooking over the summer and now I’m trying crepes. I’ve done pancakes, cookies, and soufflé pancakes
Question: can using a hand mixer in a glass bowl ever break it?
I woke up this morning and really wanted a Nutella and Strawberry Crepe for some reason even thought I had never had them. This video helped so much! 🍓🍓They were DeLiCioUs 🤤
They look like pancakes
Wow! The fact that you still reply to comments is amazing!

Lingonberry crepe with creme anglaise
I made these today and they turned out great!!
This recipe is the one I always use to make crepes
the crap was so good
I have done this so many times and I Choose this video thank you ♥️♥️♥️
great video, thanks
Can I add vanilla & butter ?
do you NEED to have that type of pan? just wondering ! :)
I'm a kid and my family wanted to make crepes, so I found this awesome video. It was practical and easy to understand, loved how you always told what the substitutes are! It was exactly what I needed thank you.
Thank you!! Can’t wait to try this :)
Can you make this with soy milk or other dairy free milk alternatives?
My favorite is banana chocolate syrup and blueberries
Thank you for using kitchen ware most of us do have in our kitchen not all that fancy stuff other chefs use. This made me confident that i could do this. Thank you!!
Will definitely try to make this one🤗
I just made them.
Thank you this is recipe we always use for crepes
can i use almond milk?
Nice and easy recipe 🌷🌷🌷
Do you need to have vegetable oil or any other oil
Turned out AMAZINGGG THA K YOUU
Quick question, is it possible to substitute butter 🧈 for Pam cooking spray??
Made these and they came out delicious!
Matt needs to be protected. I've never seem someone so wholesome. It's only been like 5 seconds and I'm already loving it
hello matt
My favorite crepes
This is actually amazing thanks so moluch
I tried this recipe and my crepes turn out wonderful thank you so much for sharing this recipe. ❤️❤️❤️❤️😊
I've been intimidated to make crepes. I love that you used a regular skillet and everyday kitchen tools. No fancy stuff. Guess what I'm going to make today after years of wanting to? Thank you.
I had no baking powder to make a pancake so I thought I'd make crepes. Thanks to Matt it was a great success. Also like the idea of a ladle-0 and tilting the pan. Plus no long intro singing or stupid jokes. Thanks Matt my Hat is off to you.
So basically like a thin pancake
Thank you!!!!
Best crepes i've ever done for my family ! thank you so much !  All the way from Portugal 🇵🇹❤
I love this !! 💕
Cant wait to try!
Great vid man your crepes are delicious🙏
I loved crepes with spinach..😊thank u for sharing..
Try eggs, cheese, nutella and meat floss! This sounds tricky but surprisingly goes well!!
Does it matter if you use large eggs
Thank you
It's been 4 years and u still reply to comments....Dude you're amazing✊🥺
Can you still use a normal pan cause...I don't have those pans. Thanks for this appreciate it!
You won’t reply to me
Made these this Mother’s Day! Super easy and was a great success! :) thank you
Omg these are amazing😋
Thanks for the video. I always wanted to make some crepes
How much does this recpie make? I’m making them for my mom to suprise her 😌
Made these for a drunk roommate at 2:30 in the morning. Thank you for sharing. They were fantastic.
Hey dude I seriously appreciate all the info you give us! For example, you give alternatives in case someone doesn’t have something specific. You also GIVE THE MEASUREMENTS. I applaud you for that bc this is the first video I’ve found that tells how much of something is needed! You seem like such a sweet guy, you now have a new subscriber!
My favorite.. 😍
I'm Gonna Try to make this in the 30 minutes I have For lunch on online school I've already done it with French toast This will be the next food I conquer in 30 minutes
tip: it is easier to flip the crepe with chopsticks.
What do you put for the heat? Like the degrees and stuff
how are  u commenting on everybodys comment
Does he really still respond?
Thanks for the video Matt! 🙂 The crepes turned out delicious. In the future I want to experiment with green tea and rose water and see what fun combinations I can come up with.
I made your crepes for my mom on Mother’s day and she absolutely loved it! She asked me to save the recipe for her. I’ll definitely be making it again for her. Thank you! :)
I made these crapes  today and they where amazing 🤩
I tried this and it was pretty good. Mines turned brown really quickly but I just put it on the temperature recommended in the video . So turned out white on one side with some specs like it’s supposed to and brownish on the other. The crepe alone tasted and smelled like egg which I didn’t like .  The thing that saved it was the chocolate and strawberries! But over all is was good.
I just wanted to thank you so much for this recipe. My mother and I used to go to this crepe place near our house when i was young and to surprise her for mothers day I made her a breakfast crepe feast! She was delighted and it made for an incredible mother’s day all thanks to you! Thank you so so much!
This was so helpful thank you! Midnight snack craving has been successfully fulfilled

Please what heat are you using? Medium heat? Like a 4? Thank you!
This is a great, easy recipe. I like to add a filling of Chantilly cream mixed with black raspberry jam and Chambord (raspberry liqueur).

Hello I'm a kinda depressed teenager who recently broke her phone and cried for hours and my phone is being fixed but it will take a kinda long time and I am currently using my little sisters phone to watch youtube vids that is my dads account and I am watching a video on how to make crepes  in 1am in the morning because I saw a crepe in the cooking manga I was reading and I'm freaking hungry in 1am in the morning but I can't find anything to eat also there are still 6 homework I how to make that will be passed in a few days....so I should start amswering them instead of watching a cooking video that I know that I might never do.... I should sleep but I'm not sleepy tbh  If you read until hear I know your probably wierd lol
After so many years  trying to do crepes, this is now my favourite crepe recipe thanks 💕💕💕

I like mine filled with banana slices and smothered in maple syrup🤗
Wow I never seen a creator respond to so many comments.
How easy, I thought it was going to be so hard. Thank you for sharing. I don’t think I would’ve ever tried them because they sound so elegant & difficult. Cool!  😎  Watching you from: Bakersfield, California. 🇺🇸❤️

Wish me luck! I’m going to try to make these right now 😅😅 thank for you an easy step by step video!

Yum! Thanks for sharing this amazing video. I'm gonna make this in a few days for my parents. It's just upsetting that berries are only available in summer, ugh can't add strawberries the whole year. :( **Edit: Can I add a bit of oil in the pan? Our pan, which was ONCE non-stick, is now a "Stick pan" 🙄 😭 **
Recipe looks awesome :)

Is it possible for you to write down the instructions I keep having to go back to the video I think it would be easier please! (:  Thank you for the recipe!
Hey can I store the batter in the fridge and eat it in the morning?

New subby here! I was looking for a new crepe recipe because I wasn't having any luck with the ones I've tried. This one is a hit! It held together well & it tastes great! I love crepes filled with sliced bananas & whipped cream & topped with a drizzle of chocolate sauce & sprinkling of powdered sugar! Thanks for this keeper recipe!
Oh my goodness these are probably the best crepes I’ve ever had thank you!!!

I have a question how many crepes does this recipe make?

This is a great recipe. I used melted butter and skim milk and they turned out well. I liked the strawberry and cool whip combo. Also, a simple way is to sprinkle just a little sugar and cinnamon and roll it up. Nice and tasty!  Thanks for sharing this recipe
Neat

Can you use a farmer cheese,what do I add to the cheese

Well my mums not at home so I thought of making this myself
Thx a lot! Ur amazing loving how u interact with ur fans using comments even today.
Can I make this with almond flour
I have a question. I made some 'asian donuts' recently and found that after they cooled they had a strange flavor to them, my assumption would be that it was because of the oil I cooked in. The oil I used was Canola. I haven't had a chance to test this theory yet by using a different oil to cook them in, but have you found any similar type of issues when using Canola?
does he still reply??
I made these with my cousin and we loved them. Ima make them now on Christmas Day 🤠
Thankyou so much your an actual legend and watch how he replies to this comment even if I’m so late

Does the pan need to heat up first or go straight into pouring

I made some today with gluten free all purpose flour that contained xanthan gum. Came out great. I pre-mixed some Nutella and peach jam to spread on them. So tasty.
yum! I've come to this recipe every time I'm making them. delicious
Definitely the best tutorial I’ve seen. Keep up the great work Matt!
Is there a reason why it gets lumpy? I’ve made them a couple times now and realized they always come out lumpy
What the crepe soft?
Do the eggs and milk have to be at room temperature?
I made this myself and I dont know what i did wrong but it ended up being a slimy crepe and im not saying the instructions were bad I'm just saying I ate slime because I made it bad

How many crepes does the recipe make?
Iam subscribe you, would you please subscribe me, thanks 🙏 I love crepes very much
I tried this and its DELICIOUS👑💖
Nice crepes. Thanks!
Watching this in the middle of the night and off to the kitchen I go! Thanks for this fuss-free recipe!
hehe made this for my mom and dad :) they enjoyed it!! what can I use instead of eggs?? My mom didn't like the smell of egg :(
is it okay to use almond milk instead of regular milk or will it not work ?
My son loved it. Thank you so much!!!!!
Lets see this reply
I LOVE YOUR CONTENT SUPER EASY TO FOLLOW 💕💕💕
New friend here stay connected 👍
Can I save the batter in the fridge to chill overnight? Thinking of making these for breakfast!
French vanilla icecream with dark chocolate and some light white truffles is my favorite crepe.
No sugar for me Matt, I use Stevia, also, I sift the flour and hand mix it, I grew up making crepes in my native Mexico and for years I made them in a blender, I was a teen back then and not worried about calorie counting or gluten. Thanks for posting the video, I just know that over blending the ingredients makes them tougher and I like mine fluffy.
Thank you for the instruction!  I'm curious though...only butter or oil the pan once?  Or reapply? Thank you!
I made a crepe batter and I added too much butter what should I do!!!
I needed a bit of therapy but this video is going to help me make crepes and that’s about as close to therapy as I’m getting today since my therapist is on vacation currently 🥰💕✨
Finally someone remembers the  2% people 🥺
Nice
I very much dislike how many mispronounce it!!! Lol. Its a French dish. Pronounce like they do. Pleasssseee lol but looks good :)
I am going to try this out, but...… the volumes on your ingredients look off somehow. Your 1/4 teaspoon of salt looks like more volume than your full teaspoon of vanilla, I know they are different ingredients that's probably it, and is your ladle really 1/4 cup, it looks closer to a cup.  It could be the cool little bowls I don't use those, anyway I will give it a shot and let you know. Thanks
Im gonna try making this then adding chocolate syrup!
Thanks for sharing your best delicious crepes 😍
Good on you I made it and delicious 👌
can't wait to try this!! thank you !
Awesome video. I just subscribed u earned it👍
I like how you put in measurements.
Amazing just loved it
You just got yourself a new subscriber! Thanks for the recipe Matt!
can you substitute almond milk for regular?
I'm 11 and I love cooking when I saw your video it was cooking crepes and they're delicious
Strawberry filled with creme cheese filling and whipped cream and powdered sugar
Crepes are my favorite now I can make them lol 😂. I’m in trouble 🤣😂
my friend is coming over at 6am and im making crepes to try my best to impress her- so thank you, matt, our savior 🙏🙏
I don’t know if this was mentioned but how many crepes does this make
Legendary video
Thank you for sharing this recipe! My son really likes it. ❤️
When I was in culinary school me and one other person was best at making crepes and Oh My  God this vids brings back good memories thanks Matt for another hit love you man
I saw this in breath of the wild and was curious on how to make it
Thanks it’s very good
yay i can make crepes now!
You make great videos! and u explain how to make things really well!!  :-)
Thx for the recipe you saved me
Can i do almond flour instead of regular all purpose flour?
Thanks for the recipe!
Why are lumps bad for the crepe?
My friend poured all the batter the house is going to burn down what should I do?
i just did them right now and they came out sooo good thanksss!
straining the finished batter? wtf? you need to sift the flour before you mix, with a good sifter, some sifters have bigger holes, smaller are better! also, if you mix something and you have lumps, a good wisking with a good wisk helps. i know a pro chef with a pro blender at his cafe, he always uses a wisk after making a batter with that machine, lumpy or not. his crepes are awesome
This was very helpful! I just made some for the first time today.
Great vid. Just subscribed u deserved it
Today we r making crepes although i think the french pronunciation is crrrrrrreps😂😂 what a legend haha
او
I tried many recipes and this one is by far the best. Its quick, simple and tastes the best. Well done Matt!

Can you please tell me number of serving
(not forcing anyone OK just letting you know)Repent of your sins turn to God He loves you Jesus died on the cross for you so you can have the gift of repentance this world  does not love you but God does He loves you more than you could ever imagine He will always be here for you when no one else wants to be here for you we are all sinners in need of a Savior  Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior and He is very real guys He  didn’t come to die first so we would perish but he came to give us a chance at the gift of everlasting life and He also came to make us have life more abundantly so take this chance and repent of your sins and repentance is rebuking your sin and turning to God and we have to remember God is eternal but people die and we cannot get attached these materialistic things because we cannot take them with us we should cling  to God and during these times of chaos we need to pray all of the time not just in these times God does not like to see us hurting because He hurts with us  He allows things to happen for a reason turn away from your sexual desires and dreams God He’s more important than that you know if you want to get to know God more  you should try to read His word more and pray before you read  His word to ask for understanding and be still and know that He is God If someone is blocking you away from God take them out of your life because if you love something you sacrifice things for it

Me and my bestie making this by self
My kids and I are trying these today and inviting our grandparents over for some crepes for breakfast!
This is an amazing crepe recipe I have made it 3 times and its always perfect but it makes about 6 crepes and I always end up putting it in the fridge. I was wondering what would the ingredients be for a scaled down recipe for 1 person to make about 2 or 3 crepes?
REEE this taste so good :") I havent had crepes in a long time thank youuu!
i wanna try this to my everyday food. thank you for sharing. i'll wait for you friend. see u!!!!!
Could I use pancake mix to make the crêpe?
Crepes are so easy and they taste so good.
This man looks so sweet 🥺❤
Thank you! Yours seems like the easiest way to make crepe!
This was an easy and delicious crepe recipe.  I made a sweet one with berries and topped with sweet cream. The other one salty with spinach, cheese and bacon.  Thank you Matt for the recipe and how to prepare it.
Omg I LOVEEEE crepes! And I didn’t know you had a vid on it, but I just watched your cooking compilation vid and saw u made crepes!! Yayyyyy! 👌👍they look amazing!! I think I’ll probably make them for breakfast tomorrow!!! 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 thanks!!! and I rlly love Nutella crepe, I don’t have Nutella tho, so I’ll probably so powered sugar, or I also love strawberries 🍓
Can you use chocolate milk?
Thanks a lot for making this video! it really helped me to understand how to make crêpes fo my French assessment and you explain it in such a simple way! You earned a sub!
Hi Matt! We love sweet crepes but we're out of vanilla extract. What difference will it make to sweet crepes if we don't use vanilla? Is it worth it to go out and get more for a better crepe? Thanks!
Thankyou for this recipe!😊

do you need to butter the pan after each crepe?

I don’t have vanilla extract, do you think I can use honey instead?
Can I use oatmilk and brown sugar?
Ima try this, this looks delecious 😋
Im so happy I have made every cookie you have filmed
Wow tysvm! My mom loved it! She even wants a second one! I am so thankful and happy! God bless! 🥰
I need to make these bc I always want crepes
Can I use pancake mix??
I went to ihop today and ate the strawberry crepes and LOVED IT. I plan to make them tomorrow by myself or assistance with my dad. He once made crepes in different flavors like banana, strawberry, chocolate, and caramel I think. Also the chocolate might have been Nutella. I will sub to you and also try to do the recipes!
My favorite is the Nutella and banana
Tysm! :)
Can we use regular sugar?
Sweet
Lemon and sugar
i mean can i use pancake mix ? lol
Thanks!  That was an easy recipe.  Usually my wife does the cooking, but I try to give her a break now and then.  The first one looked funny, but tasted great.  The rest came out perfect.  The best part was I did it without any help from my wife.  (With the exception of finding the right size measuring spoons.)
My grandpas crepes are so bomb.
you deserve more subscribers
I really love how you make your cooking videos but I am saddened of how youtube is doing your type of channels like others -dirty by digging you and being hard to find. you have so many subscribers yet I noticed the views you have been getting don't align at all to your subscription and I know how that feels; it happen to other folks as well and it's a struggle.   I really do recommend creating a bitchute account that way you can get noticed because its depressing to know that your good cooking videos are being hidden by crappy youtube. Anyway thank you so much for the tutorial, I am going to be possibly making them today :D
I keep having trouble with the flipping, do you have any tips or tricks?
awesome job this is my fav vid on youtube
This will be my first time making crepes Any advice?
I like the way he talks so nicely, i watch this video cuz of his nice talking tbh 👍 God bless you

Thank you for the recipe! I’ve been wanting to make this for such a long time but they all failed until I saw this which gave me delicious crepes!!!
so excited to make these for my family today
This was by far the best cooking video I’ve ever seen. He has such a great and fun personality that makes it so fun to watch, and I actually learned a lot from this video. Now I can make great crepes for my family. Thanks Matt! ❤️
Clickbait

First time using THIS recipe and it turned out beautiful, I’m done with using my family’s “Bosnian best pancake recipe” this is just so hard to make and not even as good as this one

Hi
Guys help! my crepes keep turning out rubbery!
Just tried it,it was amazing so soft and goes perfectly with nutella!!
Does this acctuly work guys
Update : it was amazing .... 😍😊😊😍😊😍😊😍😊😊😊 i loved it ....
Matt, can I use self raising flour?
I absolutely love this recipe ..... it's amazingggggg🙄🙄🙄 gonna try it out tonight 🙂🤗🤗🤗 hope it goes well
Question what is the second white toping you put then strawberries.need the name.Thanks nice
Soo amazing
I made this and it was amazing. Thank you.
jus so u know there are bugs in strawberries
I like to beat the eggs before adding the milk or other ingredients.  I sift the flour first - no lumps and no over beating.  And instead of bland oil, I use browned strained butter - the flavor is so much better and for sweet ones I add a about 2 tsp real vanilla extract (double his amount) but the sugar and I put salt in both sweet and savory but less in the sweet.  The little bit of salt helps bring out the flavor and sweetness.   I like mine with little crispy edges and a bit more browned.  It really tastes better than the pale ones.
Can I used almond milk instead of regular milk?
So its basically a flatter pancake
I used the exact same ingredients with another recipe and it didn’t work.. How did it work for you??! :(
Could this be done  in  a blender?
These crepes were so freaking good omg
Those eggs don't look right ...🤨
My mother is French and she always made hers with granulated sugar  and rum in the middle
5:41 That's how I am with strawberries too my man. Awesome video! Super helpful and delicious!
Made this just now - wonderful recipe, thank you! I've tried other crepe recipes before and this one was by far the best :)
Hey Matt can you please tell me what is the name of the white cream you use for the second crêpe? Is it whipped cream?
Omg this was so easy!! Thank you for the video!! 😁
If u are not from the quarantine like my comment
Every time I make crepes I come back to this recipe. It was really good. Thanks!
will it taste good if i don't have vanilla extract only use sugar?
I'm 10 years old a i'm going to try this today. Thank you for this recipe. :)
Alright...they’re pretty plain looking when he’s done explaining and then we see them full of toppings at the end!! What exactly are those toppings? Nevertheless great video 😊

I used to go to a crepe shop all the time that put ice cream, bananas, strawberries and chocolate.  It was so good!  I cant wait to try this at home!
I made these for Mother's Day, and they turned out great -- thanks so much!
Thank youuu these turned out soo well 😌
Mom liked it
Great recipe 👍🏼 thanks for sharing!
I followed the recipe exactly but mine didn't turn out as thick as yours was. MIne was incredibly soupy and when I put it on the pan, it would just bubble and then burn. And I tried it with different heats.
Hello thank you for sharing this. Im going to try this. So excited. 🤩🤩
Hi
i work at a five star restaurant in new york and for dessert when i make the crepes we dont tilt the pan
why tilt the pan????
Enjoyable video.
If cooked this twice already! It is awesome!! Thanks for the recipe!
What was that white filling you were using? I couldn't catch the name.  I use cottage cheese mashed with sugar, vanilla and cream, once folded, fry and sometimes sprinkled with caster sugar and/or cinnamon and topped with cream and garnished with strawberries or blackberries. Heaven!
You are awesome! Thank you!
going to try this
I always come to this video when I want to make Crepes 🤗❤
Now I’m no culinary expert but uhhh this isn’t really it chief
Nice 👍
What should I do if I don’t have nutella? 😔
I tried making crepes for the firs time a few days ago. It came out okay, but while the crepes were "cooking" they swell. Why is that? Did I put too much batter? I used a 1/4 cup for each crepe. And I let it chill for over an hour (because almost every recipe said to do that.)And mine weren't paper thin, but they were thin. I love crepes, so I plan to make it again (and let it chill overnight). But I'm really curious as to why it swell.
Awe this mans smile makes me smile. That’s super sweet
I’m looking for some Mother’s Day breakfast 😗
How much oil do we substitute for the eggs if we are vegan?
I'm giving it a try right now 😄🤗
can u give me more desserts to eat after fasting
Can you use almond milk instead
can we do crepes without vanila and sugar?
This is the best crepe recipe ever. It's super easy, the hardest part is just flipping it, but even that's easy. Good job Matt.
Amazing recipe definitely trying this
what if you made a crepe burrito with regular burrito ingredients
How do I avoid my batter from getting those white spots of flour? Great video 😊
How many people will it serve usually?
I whisk the batter while I add small amounts of flour. That makes it so it has no lumps.
My neice Uzi of Abu Dhabi send me this link.it is very nice
I love this
I don’t think you’ll respond but how many of them can you make with this exact recipe
Thank you so much Matt loved the recipe!!
definitely making these! thank you for this recipie:D
About try tomorrow

Thank you Matt! You are da man!
Good morning  🌞 And Thank you for this amazing recipe, easy and straight forward recipe!!My children and I loved them.
Im trying to do it but it sticks to the pan😫 even if I put oil! Could it be that my pan is too old and doesnt work? Or is too hot? Please help🙏🏻
How many does it serve?
How many crepes does this recipe make? Video didnt say.
Wow! Will make some tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe
It was amazing , I tried it
Amazing!!! So easy to follow along and I love how you ACTUALLY use household items everyone has! Keep it up👍🏼
This looks amazing!! Gonna try this now!!
I've just tried this recipe and guys its out of this world .... its very delicious and yummmyyy...... mine was a nutella/ bueno crepe...
Best crepe video made in April 2020 Matt your recipe is so quick and easy follow. I really liked that if matt can do it you can do it.  I tried this and at first the first crepe wasn't that good but when I made the second one it was perfect and I got better.  I am making these tonight for mum As she wanted a sweet desert. Can't wait to make them! 💜
where did you learn to cook crepes?
I immediately subscribed! I love crepes! thank you :0  If I can do it, You can do it! <3
Thank you Matt :) I made these for my little sisters and they loved it :)
:)
James T, we've got something in common, I too like strawberries almost as much as bacon😊
Made this for the fam! The LOVED it!!!!
Matt you f*&%#$@ rock!
How many crepes did it make?
I feel like hugging u🥺 u look so nice! Btw I make my crepes the exact same way!💙
I made these and they taste exactly like crepes you would buy at a French Cafe. Absolutely loved the recipe, thank you, it was so easy to make!
Ok matt real question are you cursed to reply to everyone who comments 😕
Great recipe, easy to follow and  came out great! Approved by my picky eater. We visited paris in March and ate lot's of crepes, kids told me they tasted as good as the ones in Paris.
Nutella and bluberries, Nutella and banana, and the dutch bacon, cheese and syrup is the best.
is it crispy though?If not how do I make it crispy?
I followed your instructions and they came out delicious!!! Thank you so much for this recipe!
When u took a bite for some reason i was drooling. Over the thought of it... And i actually drooled
Can you store the crepe and just reheat it? Would it affect the taste? I just don't think I can finish it all. Haha
This is a really good recipe. I tried it out and it was delicious
Your a great cook
Made these this morning for my kids. HUGE HIT! Thanks for the video!
Mine turned out a bit rubbery, what could cause it? I think I also pour it too thick
Can you add 1 cup of milk instead of 1 1/2 cups and if you can add 1 cup of milk do you still put two eggs or just 1 ?
Could I use brown sugar as opposed to granulated sugar? Thanks :)
Instructor : "If I can do it, you can do it"  Me : "Maybe, I hope so"  Instructor : (flips the crepes all over the place)   Me : "Yep. He really meant that" 🤔👀
love this video
i just made these and omg they were so good! they tasted just like they were from my favorite restaurant! for sure going to be making these more often
Thanks 😊
Can I cut down this recipe in half? And If I can then how many crepes would I be able to make with that half version
Thank you ❤️❤️
Hi Matt. Thanks for this simple crepe recipe. It's my go-to recipe and fool-proof! My favourite topping is lemon juice and granulated sugar. It's a little different but it's yummy 😊
My fav is butters and bananas
I loved your video, I’m making mine right at this moment...
I usually get plain crepes add butter and grape jelly powdered sugar and syrup on top
Like many others, quarantine has brought me to YouTube in search of cooking videos to help me learn to cook new things. This is one of the best I've seen for easy-to-follow instructions.  Music isn't too loud and you are easy to follow. I will be checking out your other videos!  Now on to my crepes!  P.S Do you have a favorite savory crepe? Thank-you!
Can we use ghee instead of melted butter or oil
Can we use a hand wisk? Am going to make crepes for my family tmmrw!
thank u its was easy without complcated details
I was really looking forward to seeing the banana 😔 one
Thank you Matt. Watching all the way from Kenya ❤

But thanks for taking the time to make this video! It’s definitely going to help for my audition for becoming a live-streaming host on Monday.
The first flip had me 💀
I’m definitely trying it for breakfast 🥞
Great video! Clear steps, easy to follow! I made a crepe cake with your recipe and it turned out amazing!
uhh so i literally don’t have butter to put on the pan can i use like oil instead??? i NEVER cook someone PLEASE help i’m bored and hungry
I really want to practice making Crepes because as a child my father was never really there for me. I'm now in high school and I see my history teacher as a father figure. I want to do something for him on fathers day, and he told me he has a sweet tooth so I thought, "Why not Crepes?". This video is very helpful, thank you very much. Although I don't know if I should add the vanilla and sugar. But I loved the video, you got yourself a new subscriber,  keep doing what you do and thanks very much again! :)
First time making them! Came out delicious !! Ty!!! Made Quarantine baking fantastic!
Quarantine got me making stuff
It don’t look so good
Maaaatt! My favorite cooking instructor! Fun fact, you posted this video on my birthday, holla! Thank you for your videos. My crepes just came out ugly AF, but also tasty AF bahaha. Wish I knew how to post a photo. Keep sharing your talents:)
Like if you want him to bake a GIGANTIC CREPE
Any kind of jelly or jam can be a good filling.

Cinnamon and sugar
I made them and they came amazing
I love kinder crepe
It is the worst crêpe recipe i have ever tried  If you are seeing my comment please don’t try it :)
Oooops  ..... I put the melted butter in with the cold eggs first, ummmm butter got lumpy. My bad....
Do you have a pancake recipe on your channel?
Good Job👏🏾very helpful recipez
valuable video. Simpler than I thought. I have ALL those ingredients
*strawberries*
Hi u may add some chocolates to n coconuts year or butter n slice if banana
is it ok if u use self raising flour
I tried it but I failed because I couldn’t flip it :(
I love this video
It took me a hour to like ALL your vids XD
Omg I lUV your intro HOW ID U DO THAT wait a second........ HOW DID YOU EVEN GET ALL OF THESE DELICIOUS RECIPES ;-;
Just made them this morning thanks to your video! Very easy to follow step by step and they tasted delicious! The batter taste great!
I made it and it tastes so freaking good 😋😍
I made them and they looked really good you’re recipes are soooo good
i was gonna make this bc qauratine turned me into a chef all day, but i don't have chocolate/nutella bc my sisters always finish it in 1 day :c
i swear this video was like 3 years ago and now bc of quarantine i have nothing to do so lma try to make a crepe lol :)
ily
This man still responds to comments even after 3 years. What a legend😎
Who’s here because of corona?
me and my sister in quarantine watching your awesome vids we are gonna make some crepes now thank you Matt! :)
What he said he love strawberries more than tasty bacon
LOVEDDDDD IT ❤️
Can you do churros please
作ってみます٩(   ᐛ)و
Being in quarantine is making me expand my “culinary” skills lol
I think you have to practice first before taking the video. Flipping the crepe is a skill.
ONE QUESTION: do we have to add the vanilla? Cuz I’m bouta bake it w my mommy but we don’t have vanilla 😰
I love how Matt replies to the comments lol, btw just subbed :)
😋❤
Best crepes ever my daughter is addicted
Made these and they turned out awesome!
This doesn’t work
Its 2am....I want crepes
The same basic recipe we used at IHOPs.  Just fill with warm fruit compote and top with whipped cream and vanilla icecream.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar.
It will be good ONLY if you can get the crepes as thin as possible. And also they should be crisp and moist
who is here after the lock down and crying bcuz this is easy?
Hi Matt thanks for the crepes recipe , was very easy and turned up delicious
Americans idea of crepes is Britain’s idea of a pancake 🥞
I love this ones like Lods Shouth Pancake House Its has warm lemon  and power  sugar  Squeeze the warm lemon juice all over the powdered sugar  it is the best.
I put strawberries, cream, nutella, ice cream, blueberries, and bananas. Then fold it like the first one. Yes, I put in all of that😂
Am I the only one who finds it weird how he says “new”-tella instead of Nutella
My base batter came out so salty. And I added the right amount. 🤔😩
Hey Matt could you make churros?
Yummy... Hungry tummy here 😋
Finished 150
Man... no
Can I use cane sugar?
Thank you so much!!!!!❤️
Using this recipe I made them two mornings in a row. They turned out so well that my son showed his French Teacher. Le Voilá et Merci
did these made about 7-10 crepes and the fam loved em
prestige
Made these today and it came out REALLY GOOD!!! THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!!!
I went today to get food coloring and heavy cream so I can make crepe cake. 😊
These were so good thank you! 😋
Thank you I’m ten this is so easy!😂
These turned out horrible!!!! IT all crumbled apart when you try to flip it!!!!!!!!!  Yeah and I wasted all my ingredients Too👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Looks great, gonna try it tomorrow. Thank you.
This was such a disappointing I followed the whole vedio and failed
Thank you Matt 🤤🤤👍👍
The best crepes 😍I made it many times and we love it ❤️
This is how I do pancakes lol
Thankyou so much better then in store and easy as and taste good
Lovely recipe yummy.
Lingonberry spread or plain cottage cheese
Why can't i get mine to look this nice?
Why are you sitting while blending
Warm milk will no make lumps
THANK YOU I MADE THESE WITH NUTTELA AND DAMN THESE TASTE AMAZING
Do you add a little butter each time that you pour a ladle of batter in the pan? Or only for the first one?
Way too much salt. Almost gagged eating these, skip out on the salt or only add a pinch
I love how you just go straight into the recipe, and not drag it out with a lot of unnecessary talking.
Thank you so much! This is something I've been wanting to make for a long time but never knew how you made this so easy to follow thank you :)
How many does this recipe make ?
Lol 😂 like the Simpsons reference!
It actually worked thank you!
Oh we Americans!!!😎😎😎
Great instructions
How low is the heat?
Omg I thought my crepes were ruined I didnt even see the whole video it turned out so good ..... thank u sooo much
*T H E Y   T R Y N A BE C R E P E*
Yummy
Those are more like pancakes than crepes, too thick, needs to use about half the amount of batter he's using each time.
I really live it  My little brother ran to me to ask more😂💜 My family really love it  Thank you 🙏✨
So happy , i just made them for my special one since it’s Valentines day and it’s soooo yummy 😋 thank you for sharing this awesome video with us 🌸
amazing delicious recipe thanks alot love u  #respect
Your supposed to add milk little by little.
very american adaptation
Ok I tried this and it looked nothing like that
OMG.... Best ever sweet.. Mandarin orange crepes!!! Soften cream cheese. Cook crepes and stack with wax paper...they will stick together. Warm 1 cup orange marmalade in a sauce pan then set aside to cool.  Reserve 1/4 c sauce. Add Mandarin oranges to remaining warm sauce. With electric mixer (or hand mix) add reserved (1/4 )warm marmalade to cream cheese. Layer crepe, cream cheese mixture, marmalade orange mix. Roll and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve with scramble eggs topped with scallions and crisp bacon.
using this for a cooking project, and got a 100 thx so much :))))))
I love baking/cooking, thank you for adding this weapon of mass deliciousness to my artillary of sugary weapons :D
I love the recipe and the two ways you plated it too. Thank you. Im gonna make it for my kids right now.
Can we we put butter instead of oil and can we skip vanilla extract
You are just amazing !! I can't wait to have it for breakfast !!! Thanks for sharing

"or the French translation, as I believe, is (c--rrrr-ep)!" not rlly but pretty good attempt!
I don't like strawberries with pancakes, I prefer them with jam.😁
I just made the crepes with your recipe and it turned out great! I was skeptical at first because I’ve never made crepes before but your recipe was simple enough to followed. My 12 years gave the thumbs up. Thanks for sharing your recipe!
Thanks this video now I know how to make crepe my fav is Nutella
This looks good
Excellent recipe..we have used this recipe quite a few times and our crepes always turn out to be of a very high quality. Thanks!
He did the French pronunciation kinda wrong 😳
Great recipe. However, you suck at flipping 😂👍
I HATE THE BACKROUD MUSIC AHHHH
5:44 " I love strawberries...almost as much as bacon." Me: SUBSCRIBED  You get me good sir.
The first one is always The worse one But I LOVE crepes! 🥞
How in the name of god would someone think it is pronounced "crapes" Wait...."NEWTELLA"........what?????🤣

Man, I was craving some at 12 am and wasn't able to go to a crepe place so I searched a tutorial on YouTube thinking they'd be super hard to make and guess what? I'm eating 5 of these right now thanks to your recipe. They're so good!!! Thank you so much!
My crepes were really thick what do you think I did wrong
he kinda looks like thebudday
Your video is very helpful!! Instructions are clear, exact measurements. Thank you. I am watching on Nov. 12 2019. I am going to make these crepes today 💗😀😊
Can I use olive oil?
Thanks for sharing this video. It’s very helpful and your crepes look amazing, delicious!
Awww he is so nice. Definitely makes you want to try your best!
Have you ever made rose tarts? A small pie filled with cream and fruits of your choice. And a delicate pastry rose. The fruits are, to my understanding, boiled in rose water.
Basically a thin pancake.
Nice easy recipe and good crepes thanks matt
I like him def following
So do these taste like an omelet???  Not sure if I ever had one.  They look really good!
Mmmm...I love a clean kitchen!!!!😍😍😍
I'm terrible at this, it took 5 tries for it to resemble something but they all tasted good even though I undercooked most of them
Am I the only one who are these while I was making them?
I’m so sad I can’t make this :( My mom said when I move out I can do whatever I want when I get my own house
Thank gou
Very nice and easy. Thanks
Thank you so much I make this for my family the same way you do and for myself and they love it thanks for teaching us your recipe Matt
Me: finds this video Also me: I HAVE FOUND BREAKFAST!
Mines only made 3 and a 1\2
Do you think I can make this if I don’t even know how to make pancakes
OMG tysm this helped me so much
Wow!!!! My favorite it's the strawberry with sour cream. I love it.
Yum
Do you only add the salt if you are making savory or do you add the smaller amount of salt regardless?
he is the best cooker ever
Do the milk and eggs need to be at room temp ?
Made it last night and it was great texture. Love it. Thanks!
ran out of milk, can I substitute water instead?
I love sweet crepes with fruit but also love them with chicken and favorite veggies topped with sour cream!!
I tried it and it became like mush
I would like to know how chicken with cream sauce is made. Had these at restaurant and it went out of business years ago. Can you help?
Thank you for this vid, I'm 14 and can now make crepes for breakfast!
I love the spirit when he say, "If I can do it, you can do it." Thanks for the positive vibe.
i made this crape a million times it is so amazing
Thank you
Can you use pancake mix
It’s amazing how you can teach me im only 10 yrs old and your teaching me how to cook 😄
gonna make this tomorrow inshaa Allah for my husband... 💞💞💞
Nutella
Worse cooking I have ever seen!
so hungry now!
I have been buying desert crepes , (dolce de leche, and strawberry favorite) from a little place by my house called Crepes  De Paris,  I have them delivered through postmates because it's not an easy place to get to , I order about 2-3 crepes every other day which is getting expensive, so I'm looking to see if there is a way for me to replicate what they make,  in an easy way at home.  However,  after the pancake debacle of 2013, when I tried to make pancakes and set of all the fire alarms while burning the pancakes,  my family is a bit leery of me attempting to make anything similar again,  especially since I've had a stroke and have a hard time following recipes because of my memory issues.  I am considering buying a crepe maker for myself and some ingredients to try out. So I am wondering if anyone has any ideas or advice as to the easiest and safest way to try this. I will definitely follow the links you provided as well.
What’s that white ingredients ??
Can I do it with brown sugar plz reply
Thx Matt
Thy just fall apart
did you know that his channel is mainly about cooking?
Nutella Crepes are absolutely delicious!!!
dang he’s positive and cheerful lol

Anybody else trying to make crepes while high
Matt: LOOOOOVE Strawberries. almost as much as baaaacon Me: lol
14 years old and home alone on parent teacher interviews day. Trying to keep my sanity with Nutella stuffed crepes, thank you
Yummy
Just give you a thumbs up, not because you make a great video, but because you put the recipe in here and i dont have to go other place, also i subscribe
That Looks Good
nah yall just put a thin layer of pancake mix and flip it after put sum nutella in it done
Wait so this is kinda like pancakes but like more thin??
Matt: You can strain it if there are any lumps left   Me: *too lazy to get a strainer so instead is mixing furiously to make sure there aren't any lumps*
I’m Croatian and my grandma makes the best crepes ever.  She lives far away so I can’t get the exact recipe from her but I’ve seen her make them before. I’ve yet to find someone with the same recipe as her 😥
I just came back from France and now I’m making these😂
yall doin things wrong. you fill the center with scrambled eggs and you make a burrito with the crepe. Then you throw the powdered sugar on top with 2 types of syrup, like strawberry, boysenberry, or regular, finally topped off with sprayed whip cream.
Hi Matt. It looks so easy. Good  video. I love crepes. My favorite are  crepes Zusette
Um I have a question you might not respond but when we make the sweet crepes do we need the vanilla extract or is it optional?
I like lemon juice with powdered sugar on my crepe
I've made these about 4 time and I keep thinking abt them
Its the 3rd time i tried making crepes. They turned out really amazing. ❤️❤️ The rest two attempts were a fail.😩
Just powered sugar with a little butter ... always brings me back to my child hood ❤️😻 and I roll it like a burrito 😬🤪
I have a question instead of flour can you use pancake mix?
Can i use pancake batter? Because our flour is bad at making crepes
I had to watch 4 vids before Matt gave me the measurements without the "visit www.mystupidwebsite.ugh for the measurements" Thanks matt, you get a sub for that!
Not all heroes wear crepes
Hahah, I like how you sorta failed at the first flip. Shows that it's ok for me to fail too later and just fix it and not panic
I've been looking for something new for breakfast. I love this idea!
Do I need a blender?
I think you not batter cook because I try it is not working
My crapes are as thiccc as pancakes
I am now subscribed and also thank you for teaching an easy way to make the crepes
He made them a little bit too thick. To get those perfect golden brown crepes that melt in your mouth, you want to use 5-10% less per crepe than he was using. You can layer the crepes on top of each other if you like them a little thicker.
Thanks Matt!!!
Just made these crepes with my friends . super easy and yummy
*i still use this uwu* The time i tried this without help there was too much milk xD but i fixed it! And it was delicious  I feel weird since im an animation channel randomly commenting
I love NEWTELLA
Can u make a Chocolate sponge cake
Thank you for your video! It’s really easy to follow!     I used my fingers to flip them, to me is a lot easier like that!
4:00 looks like a tortilla
Crape
basically extra milk in pancake mix
This is a great tutorial! I have some lingonberry jam that I wanted to put on some crepes! Thank you for making this so easy to follow!
Thank you for being straight forward no bs helped alot!
Can I just use pancake mix but with extra milk ?
Who else thought their phone was stuck at 3:09
I had tried two batters, cleaned the pan out an insane amount of times and for some reason my crepes were staying runny and not cooking. Thank you for your recipe and video! The crepes came out beautiful, they smell amazing and best of all, they are DELICIOUS!!! And I love sweet crepes! Anytime I make crepes I have to make sweet cream cheese! I also LOVE my crepes with bananas and strawberries. I also enjoy putting matcha powder in the crepe batter, but today I was having a nightmare trying to make it so I passed on the matcha. I’ll have to try the matcha powder in your recipe next time! We used to have an Asian crepe-ery (how do you spell that? Lol) and it was the most magical place on earth! Every time I went I would get the matcha crepe with azuki bean (sweat red bean) spread with azuki bean ice cream. It was HEAVEN! I’m still trying to find a great azuki bean ice cream and recipe for the spread.  Thanks again for your recipe.
My grandma makes me say pancakes because she's from za
*u TrYnA bE cRePe*
i had to use almond milk we didnt have any regular milk is almond milk fine
Thanks for the video! They came out sooo good 😁😁😁
2 eggs  1 and 1/2 cups milk 1 tsp oil  Blend together   1 cup all purpose flour 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp vanilla 1 tbsp granulated sugar   Mix together   If it’s lumpy then strain it  Turn heat on stove between medium and high  Put a little bit of butter in the pan  Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan (take the pan off the heat) then tilt pan all round to evenly spread the crepe   You want it to get dry on top, it will take 1-1.5 min  Take a spatula and flip it. Leave it on the other side for 10-20 seconds   You want it to look kinda like a tortilla
Thank you for the recipe! This was my first time making crepes and they were just like crepes from a crepe shop.
Followed this recipe to the T and by far the best crepes I’ve ever made. Came out actually looking like crepes and tasted so good too. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks so much.
I made these this afternoon for my family and I and they are amazing! I have tried the crepe recipe from the TASTY channel and they were lumpy and they tasted like flour. Your recipe made them super smooth and just like crepes from cafes! They taste like the crepes I’ve had in Quebec, Canada. They’re super good with jam, honey, or fruit. Thank you! I doubled the recipe and it made 16 or more crepes so perfect!
you can also lift up and edge with a spatula and then flip it with your hands its a lot easier thtas how my mom does it
What about almond milk sir?
Best crepe recipe ever!  Thanks so much Matt.
Filling of half cup grated coconut sweetened with 2 tbsp sugar
I just made these crepes with dulce de leche and they are DELICIOUS! super easy and fast!
I hope you can make mango version of this
Why do I always end up with burnt crepe
They tryna eat Crepe
بجرب يارب يصير حلو ❤️
HowToBasic did it better though!!
I tried the thin pancake thing but it just ripped so I used regular flour tortillas and it came restaurant quality
Parfait! 👍🙂
So I don’t know what to put on mine. I don’t really have anything at home
Made these for my wife this morning because it was her birthday. Not only were they easy, my wife absolutely loved them and wants more. You did it and now I can do it. Thanks Matt!
whats the serving size of this amount?
Thanks, my crepes turned out great. I would try this again. Follow intructions and you get delicious crepes!
My favourite crepe is ice cream crepe 🤤🍦
I give you 6/10 I liked that it was a tasty crepe but the crepe was gooey and I liked that the recipe was easy to follow.
Try stuffing one with cottage cheese, cinnamon and sugar... then broil it for a second with a little butter on top!
...
YES! I HAVE NUTELLA! but...I don't have anything else! o.O
I usually sift the flour into the wet ingredients, seems to help for me....
I can never flip it properly so it rips up a lot so I just cut it up and put Nutella on it
Thank you I was reading recipes and found out I have to refrigerate for an hour. I really didn’t have to. Thanks for the tip if it came out lumpy; mine kind of did. Thank you!
I thought mine was too liquidy i ended up making a pancake
"Almost as much as bacon" 😂 I love that !
Mix cream cheese cottage cheese together put inside n put your favorite fruit r pie filling on top
Your awesome!! I have watched A LOT of cooking videos/tutorials... You are so without a doubt the ABSOLUTE BEST!! I love how you simplify everything. No overcomplicating. IF YOU CAN DO IT, I CAN DO IT!! 🤡🤡😁✌️🙏💞💜👩‍🍳
Good
2 eggs 1.5 cup of milk tbsp salt tbsp oil 1cup flour
I made this, absolutely simple and delicious
Thank you so much! Promised to make my family breakfast, and this was a total lifesaver!
this made me so hungry
Why you saying nootella boy
Can you hand whisk it?
Turned out fantastic never had god pancakes like that it better then my mom's lol
Mesurements are bad
Tortilla + pancakes had a baby = crepe
I got my perfect one on the third, first two stocked to the pan
The recipe was perfect! thank you for your video! I like to just sprinkle brown sugar on mine.
Im craving for crepes and thanks for your video couz i can make my own now...
Can u save the bread part of the crepe for later use
So is this just pancake mix?
I had strawberry and nutella crèpes
Favorite filling, rhubarb. No contest.
Can u use pancake mix instead of flower
Nice guy.
I love mine with mango l 🤗🇵🇭
hands down, crepes with honey and cheese are delicious.
My grandma used to make me tuna fish stuffed crepes when I was a child.  My other favorite was a sweetened sour cream liked crepes topped with crushed strawberries and whipped cream  How about a gluten gluten free/  cassava flour crepe dairy free recipe ? Perhaps a nut milk? And use Swerve in place of white sugar.
Damn this was easy
Bravo mina morocco a aimé la recette 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
thankou for the recipe it was good
Great teacher 👌👌😊😊😊 thanks

Thanks.  I like mine with sugar
that sure looked like more than 1/4 teaspoon of salt! more like a 1/4 cup?
Yum
Sooo.. I followed the recipe to the T, made the crepes, rolled em up and cut them transversely into fettuccine sized slices and opened em up, drizzled nutella over it and IT was THEEEE BEST chocolate fettuccine ever! They were so moist and perfectly satisfied my pregnancy craving. Thank you so much 🤩
L
This was so helpful! I was wondering though, how many crapes does this batter make?
I wanna make this,now... :-)
A mixture of softened cream cheese, sour cream, and sugar is awesome rolled up with berries as well. It's like crepe cheesecake.
It's also good to put in is any Vanna cream cooked Hello pudding Andorra Cholate cooked pudding  or butterscotch or carmal pudding and or coconut cream pudding cooked Hello kind and you can also add bananas and or blueberries but not at once crepe  add pudding and banana sliced up roll it fold it and put Ice cream and pancake syrup on it
what can i substitute to milk?
Yummy... 8th looks tasty❤❤
just used ur recipe and they came out really good. thanks for easy recipe
👌👌👌
5:53       Sorry this is just a reminder for what crepes I’m making for my class tomorrow
Are you able to sub the 2% milk for coconut almond milk? Great recipe btw!
I tried many different ways to make them, but yours came out the best thank you! They turn out so good and everyone loved them
I love how he says "If I can do it, you can do it." that immediately earned yourself a sub Matt.
It looks like a tortilla
Sorry buddy no where near a proper recipe for crepes !!!
How did you make beautiful crepes.?
You make this look so easy. Can we make the batter and store it overnight?
ham and swiss with raspberry jam topped with powdered sugar
5:35 what's that?
THING I COULD USE PANCAKE COMPLETE JUST ADD WATER BATTER
Hi Matt, can u make a video on Belgium waffle. Thank you
Cooking Mama on Nintendo prepared me for this
Thank you sooo much this is the first time i do it and it's a success! I can't thank you enough
Wow...ive tried so many recipies but this one always works!!!! :)
Thank you for sharing. Looks amazing. My favorite crepe is lemon and sugar.
Crepes are literally just a flat pancake
We live the mex to rilx for how mane minute
My favorite crepe recipe is: Smear nutella all over the crepe Remember to have an in visible line in the middle of the crepe! On one line of the line, add lots of berries!  Fold like usual.🌸
I just use 1 egg, 1 cup of milk, and 1 cup of flour, and it works out pretty well
Make my recipe : strawberry banana ice cream top directions :chop up three strawberrys chop up one banana ok now put the strawberrys in a bowl or cup and then put bananas on top of strawberrys and then put ice creams of your choice on ( my favorite is vanilla)
I’m 9 and I will try to make this. I hope I get it right. Don’t worry I won’t use the oven myself.
New subie here. Thank you for this video. Your breakdown made this both simple and enjoyable. 😀
I love really thin pancakes, it's a fair compromise.
I wonder why u have nothing on your edges, you put everything on the center, your edges gonna be so dry
This is the kind of how to cook videos I hope and enjoy to see. So simple and delicious. Some channels go overboard and do some unnecessary things for the recipe or sometimes don’t go right to the recipe. I tried this, super helpful and good thank you so much! My mom also loved the crepes btw. 👍
THE CREPES ARE COMING
I just made my first crepes.came out perfect thanks for the video 💕💕☺️
Really nice vídeo, I loved the recipe. I must say my favorite filling is chestnut spread.
Thanks for the help they were delicious
Leave out the sugar altogether, if you're making dessert crepes because the added sugar will detract from the flavour balance of tang and sweetness of fruits and syrups.
Thank u!!!!! 💕
I'm Indian. I make its  different types.. my husband like it very much
can you use water instead of milk?
You are sooo great...and thanks for teaching ur skills.
This video...       50/10👌👌👌
Can you make a omelette
can i make them thinner?
Success 🙌👌
I think I did it wrong because my cat is flying with my toaster
Who else said fail when he flipped it?😂🤷‍♀️
what’s a substitution for vanilla extract?
I'm a terrible cook. I love that he takes things slow. Speaks slowly and carefully. & includes alternatives for items we might not have. I was successfully able to make these delicious crepes. I'm so happy. I am now inspired to cook more things now cause of this.
I made crepes with this recipe  It’s the best and easy to understand 😊
Can u make French toast
I got food poisoning 🤢🤮
Thank you so much, I made them and family loved them. Only thing I changed was I used one egg instead of two.
Thanks I love this vid
Thank you ! This video was so helpful
Can I refrigerate it for later use?
can i sub the flour for almond flour? its all i have
Simple recipe thank you came out greatl
Lemon and sugar
I really appreciate your efforts in helping us with your videos Your class is very soft and easy to understand. Thank you so much

I thought they were tortillas...
So what happens if I don't let it sit for an hour?
Hahaha he says nutella like newtella😁
“STRAWBERRIESSSS”
When he uses the mixer, not a spot on the table. When I use the mixer,  crime scene 🤦🏻‍♀️
this is exactly what my mom makes but calls it pancakes lol
You never said you love nutella Nutella is sad.
I made 8 lovely crepes with this recipe! Thank you!
Making this tonight. Thank you!
Do you have to butter up the pan each time you make a new crepe? Thank you for the video :)
I love this video. This was so easy to follow man. Thanks a lot man 👍
Och my best ones are with white cheese and spinach❤️
Can I make it on a pan that isn't non-stick
this shit was fire thank u for this
It's too thick and pan isn't warm enough!
Smoked salmon with cream cheese and fresh  chives or fresh dill 🤤
You look like a history teacher
hi
Thank you so much! The instructions and video helped me make them perfectly. My family LOVED them!    Looks like we won’t be buying out at Sofi’s anymore! 😋
fail😩mine just like a gum
I'm a chef of 6 years if you'll believe me, I'll be practicing this for 3 days and pretend this was part of my past life on another job. Thank you Sir for helping
Do what you did with the Nutella one with the other one, put em on top of each other, and that's the best way in my opi
Just found your channel and I already love it haha. Keep up the work Matt, I'm excited to try this out! :)
Great video, you seem like a down to earth cook
you were right!! i could do it!!!!! thanks!!! it's the best crape in my life !! TT
whenever someone says something ignorant or wrong, he replies with such sass 💀💀

He talks about strawberries like homer Simpson talks about doughnuts
Im hoping to make this for mom in the morning. :3 It will be a surprised with dusted powered sugar and maybe some nutalla on top

5:45 "ughhh stawwwwberrrriessss...🤤" hahaha reminded me of homer
Just made these , they were perfect and yummy!!
I made the mixture then put it in the pan. I accidentally put too much in but kept trying anyway. I lost hope but then it suddenly started going well so THANK YOU (the ones I buy are sooooo expensive but now I can make my own yay)
I tried to make the crepes and the tasted great!
Crêpe is pronounced Crêpe. Please get the accent on the E.
I'm originally from Montreal and crêpe suzette is popular there. Is there a difference?
I love cheddar cheese rolled into the crêpe!
Fresh fruit and plain yogurt with savory crepes ❤
Creme brulee
Ice cream 😩
So easy instructions thank you so much for taking your time to make videos and teach us how to cook various foods 👍😁
do i need to use vanilla extract? i dont have one
Liar 🤥 lair pants 👖 on fire 🔥 i did it it didn’t work
Strawberry with chocolate
I thought we are supposed to pronounce it as "creep" good thing I haven't order it at any cafe yet...
مدهش .amazing
Could I do this with one egg
I can't STOP watching your video... it's awesome!!
Happy Friday My Demo was a big hit  thanks your  video recipe GIFs
I loved your tutorial! I think cream cheese Philadelphia with snipped chives would be to die for. Ive just dribbled! Lol
I'm 11 (I'm allowed to do this) and it's easy
Thank you so much  looks yummy and so easy!! doing  a demo  tomorrow at my job and needed an easy recipe..
Yum! 😋 I like to put cream cheese w/strawberries inside
Try sprinkling sugar and adding a meat sauce!
Nutella
Strawberry crepe
Hahahah that flip 😂😂😂😂
It tasted so good we loved them ❤️
“Classic Nutella crepe”  .No self respecting French person would ever serve Nutella in a crepe.
Hello can we use vanilla powder because I only have that?
your measurement units disgust me
Hey, it's a good video
The way you say nutella triggers me 😂
Iiii LLOOOVVEEE STRAWBERRYYS
I make them into ice cream cones at my job🍦
I made this right after watching this video ! Very yummy! my mom and brother loved it
I can't do it
I’m a terrible cook so mine weren’t good it’s not your fault I just don’t know how to cook😂
Plain flour or self raising?
Woooohhhhh so yameee👌👌👌
never
It looks like a flower tortilla
Yummy
Thank so much for sharing! 😘
Mm delicious!!! Thank for sharing the recipe.
This video is pretty helpful, and very clear instructions.Thank you so much! I will try right now!
Love it with peanut butter.
WHY DID YOU TELL ME TO ADD SALT
can I use half and half or something like that to substitute the milk
I like to make it with honey and banana, strawberry and syrup or chocolate banana.
Lemon and white sugar is the best
I like crepes with bologna and pour a little syrup on top looks delicious  Thank you
Mines lemon juice and sugar thanks cause the other videos are not explaining ☀️💛
Thank you so much!
💗😍🎂
So easy! Tried it immediately after watching. The upside is I didn’t need use any electronic device. Thank you!
Loved this video very helpful I’m making mines now with bananas and Nutella
"OHhhh strawberrys"
Made this today and my whole family loved it😋
Now this is what I need! The awesome thing that Matt did was, that he used ingredients we most likely have at home whereas in other videos they used a lot of fancy tools.
Yum yum give me some
nice i did it aswell ;)
Make a pancake but with more milk
Can i make batter overnight and make it next day???
I used water instead of milk today, because I ran out of milk not to long ago, but it came out too...how do I explain this...it came out just to be liquid. do you have any ideas to help me find out what else to put in to make it less weirder next time?
Just tried this recipe. Turned out great and tasted very good.thanks.
Love it...simple and new to this thing...
I don’t recall how many times I made this recipe since my son is obsessed with Nutella crepes, he absolutely loves it, best recipe for crepes in YouTube hands down👌
There’s a caramel milk based Mexican syrup that will knock your socks off on these crepes, it’s called ..Cajeta.✌🏼😀
Next time can you make dumplings
yay. I have extended my knowledge in cooking breakfast :D
Hi! Im 10 years old! :) I wanted to watch this video so I can make it for my mother! It was so easy, my 21 year old sister came over to our house and helped me with the pan part! It tastes so delicious, and all the thanks is for you! This video is so specific, that even I could do it! My mother loves it too! Thanks a whole lot!
Thank you so much

"Strawwwberriess"  I imagine Homer Simpson just saying that
That helped so much thanks
Very helpful, thank you
Thanks , it make my life so easy 🤣
My mums shouting at me now because I wasted all the milk 😭😭
Oh wow this is the first tutorial that goes right for me and I’m just 12 thanks ❤️
I feel like I'm obligated to let u know it's not nootella... phonetically spelt it's NUHTELLA
I really like to make crepes with cream cheese with some lemon zest and vanilla and like you did, strawberries.
What was that flip...
Umm banana and strawberries yum
So I assume its much cheaper to make at home than to buy made at a crepe store right?
Great recipe. Tried it today and my family loved it.
Tommrow I make same food
Thank you for the video...I make the crepes today and top them with vanilla cream custard. They were delicious  indeed ^_^ (p/s I didn't have whisk or hand mixer since I live in hostel...I just used fork to mix everything.)
Marscropone and strawberries
Lemon and powderd sugar
I’m most scared about the flipping process 😅 might try making more pancakes before I try a crepe
Wow i will try now to make crepes very thnx sir wow so yammy
I normally use crepe as vegetable wrap... known to Filipinos as Lumpiang Sariwa... drizzled with some brown sauce and crushed peanuts
Pancakes and crepes are both made from batter. Crepes taste like vanilla whereas I taste buttermilk from pancakes. Pancakes are usually not folded. Also, they both appear golden brown after they’re cooked.
Thanks you very much
It's really works!! Thank you for the recipe:) so delicious
thank you!
Thank you
Can you use low fat milk?
Thanks, it works great for us👍👍
thanksMatt! i go now to the store for missing ingredients. ( i was planning watching and now need to freeze to get my crepe's)
this is so helpful and the best video which that go me passing my cook exam thank you so much
So helpful thank you so delicious
Thanks for the informational video. Very helpful! :)
soo i tried making pancakes and i failed really badly because it was burnt on the outside and almost raw on the inside (it was also really salty and tasted like baking soda) so i think im gonna try this with sugar and without salt. thanks for this video by the way, its really helpful. also, how many crepes can you make with that amount of batter?
I made this and I have to say it is the best crepes I’ve had in my life thanks sir
Made these in the morning... they came out delicious. I filled mine with nutella and strawberries. You were definitely correct on how the first one doesn't come out as good as the remainder lol
I am a huge fan of crepes but i can never seem to get the batter right i tried tons of recipes and the crepes always turn out to taste almost like plain flour, i can tell you its not a very pleasant taste this batter on the other hand turned out perfectly! This will be my go to recipe from now on! Thank you, Matt. :)
You can write the recipe plz
Sir, just a tip, add the flour a 1/4 of the total at a time, it helps make the number of lumps minimal and prevents excessive bubbling when making a crepe
Like mine with apricot jam
Made them today and came out great! Thanks!
Nice
Love this video good job 👍
thank u for video so great
A crepe is on the pan as I make this comment. Hope it comes out well. Thanks man!
I am sorry Matt but this is incorrect. You are doing it the wrong way. You have to gradually add in the milk and you have to sift the flour. I am sorry but you should not be making crepes. I bet you don’t even have a crepe license!
I made Banoffe crepes for my son with homemade Dulce🤗❤
I’m excited to try this and my favorite would be sweet
great direction , easy to follow
Can u use any type of flour like self raising or bread or plain?
I've had them only twice at a restaurant and they were like 10 bucks but with this tutorial I can make them for less than a dollar and I am only 12. Thank you so much person
Using 2 nonstick pans is much easier to flip crepes. Flip from one pan to the other. I do the same with pancakes.
Thank you so much, my first crèpe came out gross but the second was delicious! 😊
....Cheese Blintz......
Is it possible to make these on a griddle instead of a pan?
Every day l watch you
Ice cream is the best topping for meee 😋
Very yammmmmmmmmm🌺
Same way you would muffin batter but more diluted  down
What's the texture of these supposed to be?  Whenever I make them, they seem oddly spongy,
Matt, how is it that your recipes are simple, but others make them sound like lectures,  Thanks again , keep going 👍
Your so positive :D
What temperature do you heat the burner to?
I’m making crepes for cooking at school and if I’m going to put butter in the crepe mixture instead of oil how would I melt it without a microwave
Am not a mike person can I used water
Can’t wait to try this !
Can’t wait to try this !
Thanks Matt I wish I was  you when you were diving into it Although I would be a messy eater.
Try adding lemon zest and a little lemon juice to the batter. Also, substitute ricotta cheese and water for the milk.
It's crepes in English and French, not crapes.
I really liked this video because Matt uses home tools, whereas in other videos that I watched they used all kinds of fancy spatula things and crepe pans
i used this exact recipe in school! i also made homemade whipped cream using a half a cup of heavy whipping cream and sugar, and i added strawberries. these were perfect to make for my older sister and brother they loved them so much. thanks!
thank you so so much! i wanted to surprise my room mates with these to thank them for helping me out on campus. this was really helpful and simple👏👏
so you make food right so are ihops crepes frozen?😮
You are a down to earth person..God bless you..
Thanks man
Can you use pancake mix?
Thanks ....
This is easy I made it just now and you also give a good instructions because I can't really cook and this is very helpful!
Excellent
Now im hungry
Thank you sooooooo much! I loved this and I made some and This video was extremely helpful, I'm soooo making more tomorrow 👍👍👍
I made these today (eating them now), took a few tries at first but got them down and they are delicious. Super easy to follow as well. Thank you!!!!!
Can we do half the recipe ?
Thank you Mat!! I’ll make them tomorrow for breakfast 👍👍👍👏👏👏
Everybody!!! This is the most perfect recipe for thin crepes! For my 25 years of life I finally got the right formula. Thanks Chef!
oooooo straaaawbeeerrriiiess
Can you use self raising flour for this?
NeWteLa
I've never looked up how to make crepes before. My sister taught me how to make them when I was a kid. But the recipe is a little different than this. The way I was taught was : 3 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1 cup flour, 1/3 cup sugar. Mix together and cook in a non stick pan. I will give this recipe a shot.
This is soooo freakin helpful I always bought the crepes that are store bought but they always finish.. knowing how to do it homemade is amazing cause crepes is the best thing in the world😭❤️❤️
These came out great ! Thank you for sharing !!
We are doing crepes yummmy thx
This video was very helpful the last time I made crepes was in high school for French class with my grandma. Now that I’m an adult this was really easy to follow. Thanks a lot
It does AT ALL I MADE IT AND IS  does WOCK
I learned a lot with you, thank you
My favorite is with Dulce de leche! Yummy 😋
Try peanut butter on them
I've always thought crepes were complicated  but this video just makes it very easy to understand
Cant wait to try 😻
i enjoyed this recipe 👌
Can you actually make the batter perfect even without using a blender? We have a practical test tomorrow and I doubt the teacher will let us allow to use a blender.
I think this is the most detailed video I have ever seen. Awesome
K U R E P P U 0:17-19
My mother used to make crepes for us Japan unfortunately she passed away a year ago and she was doing Savory the feeling will be potatoes with chorizo and on the top spreaded with cheese and she would mix sour cream with tomato and then she was sprinkled all over and she will put it in the oven for a few minutes so the cheese could melt they were just delicious and I just needed to know how to make the simple crate but with your recipe you saved my life I can remember my mother's Crepes thank you so much Norma from California Los Angeles
Great video thanks for this!! Making these tomorrow morning😍
Thanks for the receipt.  Which one the pan or crepe making kit do you recommend?
I LOOOOOOOVE Lemon and Sugar on Crepes !!! 🤤
Could I use dairy free milk instead of full cream? I can't have milk and i miss crepes
Mmmm. Sour cream and my husband’s strawberry freezer jam.
Thanks a lot👏❤️🌺
We have those in Bulgaria they are called - Palachinka We eat it with jam or Feta/ goat cheese
Do u need to add the salt? In my family we skip the salt with pancakes and it taste the same
I like lemon and sugar
I am making pancake right now i love  your vids
Omg they are the best. I am 13 anni have made them
Super !!! Thanks for charging loved it
Would you add butter again after making the first crêpe or would you just leave it as it is and carry on cooking on the pan?
Can I live the mixture overnight send back ASAP
How much milk i didnt understand
I’m waiting for you to make a crepe cake 🍰🥞
In the French pronunciation the "r" should really be in the back of the throat and not on the tip of the tongue clip
I bet you cleaned your stove, before this video. Cause' it was crusty.
5:43 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I L♥️ve cinnamon sugar but I also l♥️ve Nutella and strawberries 🍓
Looks good :)
I’m 11 and I made these and they r easy and amazing thx
Can't wait to try this! I recently visited a crepe place in DC. It was soooo delish. It had chunky peanut butter, coconut, bananas and strawberries. Best sweet crepe I ever had!
Yummy

Can we add sugar two times instead of vanilla extract  Please reply
Faltu
:0 can we use almond milk?
you can put the flour through a sieve it should get rid of the lumps
Cre-pas
How many servings does this recipe make?
On crapes you are supposed to put jelly on it

Hi  Thank you matt, i just love it ❤ What a simple way to do it 🌹 Go on buddy 👍👍👍
I followed your steps but they didnt come out sweet tasting was i not supose to add salt if i added vanilla extract and suger?
Say “I like really thin pancakes”
Just wanted to say that in French, you don't roll the r, you use your throat to say "crêpe"
(me irl) Me : YUM MORE PLZ
Crepes are so hard to cook
I did it! I made crepes for the first time and it was a success! Thank you !
I Laughed at the flip ...hahahah
Awesome! Thanks
I tried to do it but i had 2 problems : when i try to flip it over in the pan it becomes small parts, And its so thick  Not like how they do it in restaurants  Can i have an answer pls
This is one of the most amazing and fast recipe to do! I finished doing this recipe in 10 minute! Amazing and keep upon the good work
Can we use olive oil
What temperature
I love this recipe 🍮
Thank you so much!! I finally learned how to make crêpes! And they are soooo good! Especially with Nutella and strawberries
I always thought the pancake problem was just me !!! 😭 I never knew why my first pancake was always ugly and the rest pretty
You got the basic recipe right, but there's two major things you did wrong. 1. You don't lift the pan up to poor. You poor straight down onto the middle of the pan and let the batter spread. 2. To flip it you use you hands. Crepes are very delicate and rip very easily.
Thank you so much! They were delicious🤤
Seriously these taste AMAZING This was my first time doing this and the recipe is sooo easy and simple THANK YOU SOOOO FREAKING MUCH 🤩🥞❤️
is it spelled „crayp“? no.Its spelled crêpe.SO STOP SAYING CRAYP!!
OR you can also use Skim Milk, that works too - This guy is clearly just food racist.
2018 anyone
Can you make a tortilla recepie please
this morning I was trying to make pancakes with a recipe on YouTube but when I put the batter on the pan it looked weird and it was really thin then in my head I thought "Holy shit did I just *accidently make a fucking crepe????*" and ate it and it tasted different than a pancake would so my grandma came in the kitchen and was "ooh you making pancakes?" and I'm just like "I don't even know anymore" she looks at the pan that has a pancake? crepe? I don't even fucking know and goes "wtf is that. it looks like a really thin ass pancake" so she took over the cooking and now I'm watching a crepe recipe and I'm watching and realizing that I accidently made a fucking *crepe*.
made it, it was great! Only had almond mix so I mixed 1 cup of almond and with  less than half a cup of heavy cream. Worked for me :P
All the other videos on youtube look so hard, you make it look so easy and simple. I hope after a few tries I'll get ok at making them, I've wanted to for awhile now. Thanks.
Sounds crazy but when you try and flip it, turn the spatula 180def to how he has it - it glides under the crêpe so far more easily, then just flip it like you did when you were younger 😂
Almost as much as bacon! Hahaha 🤣
Similar like Indian wheat sweet dosa with some extra toppings,But its looking great .
It turned out to me a completely disaster😭😭😭
They turned out so fantastic and so delicious I never thought I would be able to make them thanks so much 🙂
Making this today for Father’s Day thanks so much making Nutella strawberries 🍓 crépes
"Nut"tella
What if u don’t have vanilla extract
Best recipe by far
Its Tuesday morning (I think) I'm still drunk (I know) and making chicken teriyaki and jasmine rice crepes..... Any recipes for that?
😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
Thanks for sharing,  your recipe is sooo easy to follow. I'm going to cook this for my kids.👏👏👏
I went to a crepe restaurant a while ago. I always expected them to be just like pancakes, but I was actually wrong. They were really chewy and less greasy than pancakes. The restaurant also folded them in squares, rather than rolling them or folding to fourths, which was something I hadn't seen before.
nutella and banana
U are the best 😘  i love ur recipe easy and yummy
Can I substitute corn flour if I don't have regular flour ?
Looks so easy! Thank you hope to make these tomorrow morning! They're my husbands favorite! 😊
I LIKE MY CREPES LIKE I LIKE MY BOYS; SANDWICH STYLE!

That's how I learned to make crepes instead of ordering. Thank you so much, for real!
THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE TUTORIAL
thank you so much! this video gets straight to the point and it helps a lot!
I had fun making them but I put to much salt... it was very very salty 😖
Can u put canola oil instead
Wait, can you use pancake batter instead of all those ingredients ?
this was shown in my french class XD
You seem like such a nice person 😃 lovely recipe !!😋
I'm french and i make crepe since i'm 5 or 6 years old with my sister, to make salt crepe you must use some farine de sarrasin, it's better.
Thank You Matt. You make these so simple. You're awesome. God bless
I would eat a crepe but I don’t like 🥞
Can you show me how to make a strawberry cream cheese crepe

If i want to double it can i just double everything?
The crepes so delicious 😋
I like mine with Nutella and banana
you'd better try crispy crepe in Thailand. it's amazing.
Does it matter if you use regular flower ?
My favorite! Thank u.
I'm boring with my crepes. I just like to sprinkle some sugar and squeeze some lemon juice. So good.

Tried your recipe and 😮. I love it. Love how smooth it is but the outside is too crispy.how do I cook it so it doesn’t have that crispy thin outside crust?

Can you substitute regular milk for coconut milk? I'm lactose intolerant
Can they be stored overnight? how can we reheat them?
When I made them, they turned out really chewy, but I know I made then right.😔

After Tim and I watched your video, I said "I can do that!" so I did! I tripled the recipe to feed 6 adults and 2 toddlers. I have never received so many compliments on a dinner before so thanks, Matt!!! :) I'm sure I'll be trying more of your recipes soon!!
Thank You  - lost my little red crepe book years ago.
thank you MATT
Matt those look awesome. It looks like a nice recipe for a couple of people. But will our family I would be hours and hours at the stove and that's with all 4 burners going at the same time. lol
This is so lovely! thank you! ☺
First. But, more importantly, I really NEED to have some of these. Favorite topping: fresh whipped cream. Favorite filling: fresh strawberries in strawberry syrup.
