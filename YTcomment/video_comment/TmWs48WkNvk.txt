Yum!!! 😋😋😋👍
Cook time is 20 - 45 minutes?  That’s a pretty wide range for pressure cooking.  What am I missing?
It looks delicious but how the instant pot time?
Yahoo montain dew !
The torch is the way to go.  Good stuff.
For how long do you cook it?
I've never heard of an instant pot. Is there another term?
Hey, Mike another awesome and very professional video as usual. Please, can you tell me if it would be possible to cook a Chicken Cordon Blue in a pressure cooker?
After you make this recipe, come on back and let me know how it turned out for you. Especially after you use my secret ingredient ☺ Mike
