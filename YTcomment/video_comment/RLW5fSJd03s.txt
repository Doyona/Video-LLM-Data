Love this.  I love my Acrylic babies but I am going to try this method for my teenage. She’s in her beauty Era and this would be a great little lesson for her. Thank you for your video !
Oeeeeh niceee❤🎉
💕
Are they good for like day-to-day things like putting your hair up and stuff because I’m about to make them and I don’t wanna regret it😅
Also what kind of glue do you recommend?
Ok so no putting on the acrylic powder at all? Also what kind of clear nail polish do you recommend? I’m so excited about to try all of this
Please do a video on a fill for nails
I love this. I've been looking for something easy and not needing to spend a fortune in the salon - thanks can't wait to try this out :)
Does it work with any powder
Oh my God! I'm glad I found you❤
where do you purchase the materials???
What type of glue are you using ? hope that's not a silly question
I done went to 5+ different salons and have to beg NOT to touch my cuticles but I’m always leaving with them torn up; and not think but sometimes to most times leave out with them look bulky. I’m tired
Watching silently, what is the liquid with the cornstarch?
Aye she snapped on this set yall she on her shi+
Can I just do this using a full nail tip instead of a 3/4?Do I needto do anything different?
lmao can you use pancake mix if you have nothing else?😂
does anyone know if this works with regular polish and cornstarch or flour? i don’t have gel polish…
Does it last a lot
So easy simple and quick.
Can i use corn flour instead of corn starch?
I tried this a couple years ago and it didn't look good
What a great video. I'm at the point I want to get away from that horrible drill
Love this video. I totally agree that slender looking nails are so much better and natural looking. You make it look so easy. Thankyou. 🙂💜👌
Can you use this same method with gel polish? And a uv light?
Sorry to ask, but what was white power?
Can’t wait to try this! Will any clear polish work or the cornstarch layer?
At least put your manicure normally
This is such a great idea,  and the look great.... but I am WAY to rough on my nails and even break my chunky ass acrylics.  I can just see these snapping off all over the place! But definitely great idea for those with more delicate hands
I tried this- they looked beautiful, but started falling off after a day and a half. I'm on day 3 and have lost 5 nails already. I prepped my nails, and it looks like I used the same glue in the video as well. 😞 I would love to know how people are getting this to stay on for a week plus
I don't have to file it down before using the acrylic nails
How many days does it lasts
What is these white color things?!
Love this thanks
Great video
Wont the nail bend because it's so thin?
OMG I'm going to try this one, I really dislike acrylic on my nails, it feels too heavy and in no manner if I did it or shop it still looks bulky, but this method I will try, I just can't believe it, thanks again.
Hi! Can you please do a video on how to remove them? Or if you did can you plz link it down below
who else is reading the chat to see if this actually works!?!
When you say “last about a week” do you mean that’s how long before the tips start coming off?
Could I try this look but use gel polish instead?
Holy cow, you're amazing!!!
This is beautiful..I tried refurbishing my helmet...pls watch this https://youtu.be/pYiHmcOcIzA
I had not thought of ever using the same size nail on more then 1 finger, lol!! You made such clear sense!! I love the way you have explained and simplified this.  Thank You
Should you apply a base coat to your nails before attempting this?
So sad to see that some women can't have natural long nails and have to put on fake ones !
I'm trying this 100%
Power ya
Do you have a video how to remove this?
This is so good I got acrylics in the summer like 4 months ago and the glue only just came off a week ago.
Oh WOW 👍🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Girl........this is mind blowing. Thank u so much.
OMG WHAT DID I JUST WATCH? COMPLETE GAME CHANGER!! THANK YOU SOO MUCH YOU DESERVE A LIKE FROM EVERY GIRL WITH NAILS <3<3<3
I don't really understand, so nail polish remover is enough to remove the glue underneath the tip?
THAT'S why my fingers are super painful the next day?!?!?! WOW, I'm serious, I've always wondered!
You can see the line where the tips are? They just look bad. Idk why everyone’s hyping you up??
I got acrylic nails it wasn't a very good experience and it did hurt and the nails don't come off for a while
I did this 5 days ago and they look and feel amazing! They are so strong and look like natural nails. I am curious if they would last longer if I brushed in nail glue instead of the cornstarch and polish mixture. Polish does not want to stick to my natural nails I am always sure to there is no shine, they are clean and dehydrated but it never fails that the polish comes off around my skin line. I am wondering if a coat of nail glue would make my polish and nails  last longer.
❤️♥️🧡💛
this girl is saving me a lot of money.. THANK YOU
I wish I have cornstarch but can I use baking soda for substance?
Whats the best glue to adhere the tips
I've only gotten acrylics once and I got one of the ripped off bc a football hit it- it was hella painful-
Why cant just grow ur own nails out...
Please mention the link of nail polish shade
OMG 🙀. ?????? This is amazing
Using a smaller tip messes up the curve from side / bottom and also can make nails not last as long due to airbuble underneath nail  If you use a tip too large you can file it thin / straight without compromising on quality or shape
At this point just buy nail glue and straws and put nail polish on top
hey thanks!
Great demonstration,  I to dislike thick nails.  Brilliant
♥️♥️

Are you damaging your natural nails 😑

How long does it last tho

i had acrylic nails before they used a drill and my cuticles started bleeding like worst part ever and i could not even shower the hair gets stuck in you nails
Oh 😯 harina y barniz transparente?? 😱😱😱 lo voy a probar mañana mismo.
Can you substitute the corn starch for baby powder?
I love how you get straight to the point its easy following your videos!  :)
Constarch and normal clear polish? Sorry i couldn't hear nicely.
would flour work ?
Love these thnkyou
Last 2 days?
who got anxiety when they saw that little drop of water on the file
i tried this yesterday & it was a fail :( the clear nail polish & corn starch wouldn’t dry so i had to take it off. can someone tell me what i did wrong because i really want tot try again!
The drill doesn’t hurt my nails at all! i’m not sure why your nails hurt, maybe your salon are using it wrong? x
How long does the cornstarch and clear polish take to dry? Xx
Omg
I am a mom and I wash dishes a lot...can I wash dishes with these?
What you are doing is fantastic and a great option for some.  It was really good of you to share your technique.  I'd just like to say in support of acrylics and talented techs - I shuddered when I saw your nails - bad memories of similar damage years ago.  She tore my nails off and the damage she caused took 6 months to repair.  It was excruciating. I didn't know any better.   I thought that must be how it was done. Subsequently I have had several brilliant techs and always acrylics, and my nails have actually improved and are in the best shape they have been for years ( when I see them at fill time).  So shop around there are some acrylic magicians out there if anyone is interest
Uh i don't have ANY of this at home....
Can they be removed easily with nail remover???
can you use any glue or does it have to be nail glue?
Can you do one more please 🙏
Ooooh my God i m sooo happpy now i am your fan because i have not money for acrylic from salon. But really i like your cheapest way i lv it u always b happy stay blessed my dear
This video is perfect🙌🏼
Are they pretty strong?
Why can’t I find one where you don’t need the acrylic nails 😭
Does the nail glue have alcohol inside it?
where do you buy the nail tips from ?
Did anyone else fuck up on the corn starch part? Or just me?
where did you get your acrylics?
What Nail Glue Do You Use?
I love this video!  Fast, efficient and I love that I can use corn starch!
I've always hated thick and chunky nails. I've always preferred mine between round and oval. It looks very feminine and natural.
how to remove it
finally found someone's nail hack that actually works finally. actually i used instead of starch baby powder and it still works !
Is there any alternative for the nail tips so I can extend the nails? Can’t go shopping cause of quarantine😢
You shouldn’t do this. The nail don’t get enough strength and it can flip and you can break your nail. /A nail artist.
I need to try this
*im just mad at that lost one second of the video*
Can we change nailcolur by using remover whenever we want
Who’s here because your trying to do your nails over quarantine?😂
sis... the drill shouldnt hurt...
Ran out of nail glue any substitute?
does it have to be clear polish?
Can you use flour
this is exactly what you’re supposed to do to make them look slimmer. a lot of nail salons put an oversized tip the width of your actual finger instead of your nail bed. these are 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Game changer. Acrylics suck
When I got acrylic nails the drill did not hurt.... umm
Just curious how durable are these? It doesn’t seem like there’s much to hold up the tips?
would this work for a overlay as well
I thought it was at home
This and chunky nails are the trend! That's the point of the trend
U can also do this with fake nails just cut them into just tips x
Ik this is a it late but will these nails work on short nails, as I am a nail biter.
Here coz of this COVID 19 Lockdown shiznit 😂🤣
what is you don’t have fake nails or glue or clear nail polish
I can get real acrylics but my mom won’t let so I do homemade lmao
Sooo nice colour💅😍😍😍. Greatings from 🇩🇪.
Thx
I got acrylics once and they were so painful they weren’t even that long
So you mix clear gel with cornstarch? Thanks
I am going to try this x
Did y’all also hear her smile throughout the video? ^.^ soo cuuute go gurl!!!
It hurts allot
OMG what are the exact products you used ? ! 💞
Hi! How do you remove it??
Please Tell Me The Nail Polish no.
Where do you get the kitt
what are those white things?
This is professional so it’s fine
Y’all know its coronatime
The first time I got acrylic nails was the last time and they did come out nice but the next day my thumb hurt so bad and when they came off my nails were fucked up from the drill so now I just get my natural nails painted and I've learned long nails are not for me
What drops did she use at 00:32??
Wow. O my gosh. That was amazing.  Not what I  expected.
THEY ONLY LASTS 9 DAYS AND DYI IS BUYING NAIL TIPS?..?
I have very thin, weak, ridged nails. I want beautiful nails so bad. Do you have any suggestions for me if I try this?
Can someone tell me how to remove it
Thanks so much for sharing your tips 🤗🙏🏾
I just got.p my nails done, and done get me wrong I love them, but at first they were super long! I cut them to about the size you cut yours to.
Anyone else wanting to know what nail polishes she used
Which glue did you use?
What type of glue do you use?
The clear polish and cornstarch mix is it regular polish or gel polish? Thanks
This looks so good, I'm definitely gonna try it! Btw, I never been to a nail salon, I tried it myself from the start with the UV lamp and gels and I haven't drilled my nails at all. Maybe it was because of the primer gel I used, but they always lasted for 3-4 weeks, like salon nails. I think they drill them, so you HAVE TO come back and get your nails done...?
Gorgeous!!!😍😍😍
Here is 13 year old me watching
Thank u I just tried this yesterday and it is perfect it’s really comfortable ❤️😌
Im just wondering that would they stay same time when you dont put the flour on your nail
The first time I ever got Acrylics, it was a present for my 14th birthday. It hurt so bad, she actually cut me while filing. They fell of a day later.
I had powder nails and my nails where filled useibg the electric file and my nails where fine
I'm concerned about them cracking or breaking because no acrylic layer on the tips
am i the only one seeing the lumps?!
what you put on nails
I wonder if this would work for a fill?
dont recommend sizing the nail tip super small like she's doing; you can still see its not sized properly. Having space will cause lifting. you dont have to go too big or small.
I saw a video with baking soda and glue have you tried it?
can you use corn meal instead?
How do you take them off? Thanks so much for the tips!!!
Wait idk if I just didn’t hear it but how long do they last? And what can I use as a replacement for cornstarch?
These look lumpy.
Alternative for cornstarch?
Who is still watching this in 2019?
What a great hack!!  I’ve got to try this!!
I want to try this so badly but I don’t have nail glue and there isn’t a great alternative for nail glue.
Wow!!! I have used this so many times since watching this video! You don't know how much I love it! xxx
This is so smart !!!! ❣️ how do you remove them ?? Also do you file natural nail a bit to help it adhere ??
I love your sound 🔥😘
"so we need something fake to put on"  *sits on nail*
This is literally just gluing tips onto your nails ?¿
I just want to know if this definitely works and if they actually stay on 🤷🏻‍♀️ someone please tell me if you’ve tried it
Got acrylics once. I bite my nails so finally, I really couldn't bite them, but I also couldn't deal with how heavy and weird they felt
you're so rude about so many things. thats not nice :(
Okay I know I’m really late on this but thank you so much I’m not aloud to have acrylics from family experience so this will help
are u using UV lamp to bake the "gel"?
Why not use silk or fiberglass? You can add over the tip then file smooth. You'd never know they weren't your nails. Working in the salons,  my hands were wet constantly and i had mold issues.  So i started using silk which is smoother then fiberglass and Vwalla!. Easy to remove and reapply when needed. No fills either. Id lay a bit more after a month and file. In shops they suggest buffing  and such. I just used the dehydrator and 1st coat for acrylic applications but silk with tip tell my nails grew to length I wanted.  And only a total imbecile would buff the nails to the point you showed in the pic. Its a soft buff nothing more.
No one thinks about that we right handed people also have something called a right hand!!!!? MY LEFT HAND CAN'T DO THAT MUCH WORK BUDDY!
she smiles all the time🤧💖
What kind of powder is that
What are the clear stuff you are using
She's lying, she didn't do this as a teen, this isn't a good technique. It works at first but after a shower it starts to fall off. Look up nail career education on YouTube, she's a real technician a she tested this technique
Just got my nails done but when they're off. I Will BE TRYING THIS GURRRL, YES!!!🤗. Thank you👍
What is the clear polish at 2:16 anyone help me pls and thx😁
What if you don’t have clear polish ?
would the glue and starch work, instead of the polish??
How do you take these off at home?
I see gaps and bumps where the nails meet
Sorry maybe this is a stupid question but how do you stick the top on x
How long did the set last ?
🤯
Where can you buy these tips
Have you tried this method using color street nail polish strips? I’m trying to make my nails look better and I absolutely love wearing and selling color street, but, my nails are thin and break easy. I was happy to see this video! I was looking up how to do THIN acrylic nails at home. This is the video I chose and so happy I did because it avoids thick annoying bulky chunky and damaging acrylic. Please let me know if you’ve tried them using color street? If not, I’ll happily mail you a free set for your thoughts on this method with them.   Ps it’s 100% nail polish and really simple to use. Nothing like the vinyl jamboree nails that required heat process. Fast & easy which I love, but now I need longer nails lol
IT WORKS! I did it with flour works the same
Is there a "How to remove fake acrylic nails" video?
GIRL!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU JUST SAVED MY LIFE
Wow. You're a clever lady. Thank you for your tips. Beautiful 😍
I hate my nails I asked for medium long coffin and got short fat wide square ones ughhh
How to remove it 🙄?
You can see the dent between your natural nail and the fake one 🤷🏻‍♀️
Is cornstarch baby powder a good subsititue
How long do they last
If you already have long nails, can you just use the cornstarch and nail polish as the acrylic? The just paint it?
Uh can you use flour?
Wouldn’t the top of the nail be super flimsy though because she only hardened the middle of the nail??
How can she remove it
Is there any alternative for the cornstratch-polish?
What kind of glue did she use?
Wow
excellent! i bet the industry hates you.
I love how it says no acrylic but then she uses acrylic
The drill shouldn’t hurt. 100% of the time it’s the person doing your nails
i have a friend who's nail bed is very damaged and she doesnt like it. what do you recommend she do instead of the salon?
Did she mix water and constarch?
Where can i get fake nails or nail extensions? N wat did u mixed with cornstarch?
Hey! Loving ur channel and hacks. What glue did U use? My sister does something similar with superglue cause she is a biter n has like really short nails. I want to try acrylics but I'm not sure if they are for me.
Can I use something else for the clear polish?
i can paint them with gel right??
bro what type of glue she use?
Where do you get your tips?
I know this was posted a long time ago but I’m going to ask anyways. So when she says she is mixing cornstarch and clear polish by clear polish does she mean like a top coat or an actual clear polish??
If you wanna do your nails and u have nothing to do them with, get strips of paper that fit your nail, use nail qlue or superglue to glue it on, apply a coat of the glue and dip it in flour or cornstarch, keep doing it untill it's your desired thickness, file untill smooth, then paint them :)
In my opinion, I don’t really like clear nails. I prefer natural or white.
why would you even get your nails done when you can do this!?
Can you make a list of products used and please link me to the nails.   Also  Can you do a video on how to recreate the nail tips that have glitter IN them
Informative video.... thanks for sharing 💅💕🎀💖😊😇🤗😘☺️👌👍
Can I play piano with it on?
How do you take them off
My mom does my acrylics and she does them thin cus she thinks chunky nails look dumb
this girl has the key to LIFE. she literally has a video for everything:'))
Got nail tips, clear polish and cornstarch JUST to do this. I really really hope it works!! It will change my nail game 😍
Wish you wrote the list of items you used and where you got it from.
What kind of glue do you use to apply the nail extensions?
I’m lazy as hell but this looks so dope
How do they last?? Theres no strength in them...I tried this and they all were off after a day!!! Also how does washing a file regenerate the crystals that have been worn down from filing ???!!!
Looks great. Thanks for the tip on putting the tips on. I get confused on what size is best. Thanks a million.
Your hands are also very beautiful so they would look nice no matter what.
I wish there were salons who used this technique. I like the look of these types of nails but the damage is never worth it in the long run.
I know this video is old, but I just came across it (in my recommend videos)  Wow!!! This girl is extremely talented!!! I would of never thought to do this. The results are amazing! I used to be a fan of the thick curved look (as a teenager) but now, I am looking for the the most natural looking nails.. the salons I’ve gone to, can never achieve that look. I decided to learn myself... I bought all the products they use in the salons, & am watching YouTube videos to learn. Now that I’ve seen this!! I’m definitely going to try! Not only does it look amazing! But it looks easy to do, however I can’t polish to save my life, so it maybe harder than it looks. Anyway, amazing job!! Thanks for sharing your nail secret with us!!
Can you do a nail shaping tips video??
Nail salons hate press ons. They will make every excuse why and mostly because they think it ruins nail beds and another sob story, MONEY is all they want from you. I say ladies, do what makes you feel comfortable and affordable. If nail salons are expensive press on or do it yourself acrylics are the way to go.
Is there something else than cornstarch or flour you can use :c?
I'm looking for petite clear artificial nails. Any idea?
I  took off the acrylics with my nails lmao i didnt use any acetone cause nobody got time for dat!
Can you use baby powder instead of cornstarch
Cool haha x
question: can you re-use the plastic nail after you remove the nails?
Omgosh I'm 13 and I started to do this since I was 12 I'm in love with nails ❤️❤️
What about when you take a shower ?!
Thank you! What products did you use?
I was wondering where to get those nail press ons
how thick of a layer should i use for the cornstarch and how thick should the cornstarch and clear polish mixture be?
Can you send me a pack of nails so i can do the same
Thank u so much I hate the buffing when I get my nails done and this looks so real ad beautiful!!
U need to go to a good nail tech cuz other wise they will use a high grit drill bit and go at a high speed but you can ask them to not use a drill on ur nails
I don’t have cornstarch at home. Instead of cornstarch what should I use?
Honestly those last horribly damaged nail pics that you shared look more like someone just removed there nails improperly, like if they pried them off with their teeth, and when you do that, it can peel layers of your nail. That is why why you should always soak off your nails in acetone, and there shouldn't be any damage to your nails if you remove them properly, and of course if they were done correctly.
NO NO NO! if your nails look like that after you remove the acrylics, that person does NOT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING!!!! they are not suppose to drill off layers of nail, they are only supposed to lightly  buff the surface to take of the nails natural shine so the acrylic can adhere better. Those nails look so painful and awful!!
Good idea, but you can see where the fake nail ends and your real ones begin. You can kind I see the dip. But hey, still looks beautiful and I can see it saving you lots of money.
Can you show us how to do fiberglass nails diy 😍
I really want acrylic nails but I’m too scared to ask my parents😂
Could I use straws? 😂
Hey! Can u use a nail form with these instead of tips because they r the only things i have xxxx???
Which brand and which shade of nail polish
Super excited to try this! I got acrylics for the first time 2 weeks ago and I hated that they shaved down my nails because I usually just paint my natural nails. This should save me money and the time waiting for my nails to be healthy again the next time I need a quick fix for short/broken nails. Thanks
Please tell what you use that powder and liquid
can i use the cornstarch concept to refill my acrylic nails??
Where did you you buy the tips you used?
I'm 13 and I can't freaking get acyrlic nails grr 😤
I hate that too because I have small hands so thank you for the video.  :)
I occasionally will apply hard gel to my natural nail (I don't drill or sand down my nail - maybe just a slight buff) - is that ok?
I don't get how they're acrylics because she didn't use any acrylic powder all she used were tips?????
this nail will come of in two seconds
I have a question.  How to remove fake nails attached
Why do you want to look like you have claws?
what nail glue do u use
Love u girl
YOU JUST SAVED THIS BROKE BITCHES LIFE. IM GOING TO PROM KIDS
Does it matter what kind of nail glue you use?
Omg, I don’t do acrylics on my manicures at all, but I do mostly natural nails on my dominant hand. Since I am right-handed, it’s pretty difficult to polish my nails on my right hand.
Dude, you're a genius!!  Kudos to you gal!
I hate the new look that they are doing now. I have small hands. Thanks for sharing.
Does anyone know the nail colour please?
the people out here who saying they like thinner nails are all spineless and brainless, the CHUNK is there for structural integrity, it’s called an apex and it helps your from being able to BIT YOU FUCKING THIN ASS NAIL OFF
can’t i just use paper or straw instead if the tips
Ok but you don’t want to use smaller tips because shrinkage happens and they are going to break off faster. And now you’re filing off and increasing your stress point. I’m sure these nails aren’t going to last more than a few days.
This is awesome... I love nail extension and nail art.  But every time I do my nails and ended up with damaged nails.  But this is so awesome and budget friendly and I can keep my nails as healthy as it is. Thank you so much for this video.. I really appreciate your talent.. I will try this and will tag you soon.. Thanks a lot... You are a saviour.  Love you...  😍😇
giiiirl 3:00 what ?!?!! this is the best tip ever, never heard of this before
For those of you with damaged nails:  I know I'm late to the party, but when I was letting my nails recover from constantly wearing acrylics, here's what I did: wondertips!!! Omg! These are seriously EVERYTHING! anyway, glue them on, then just top with 3-4 coats of nice thick top coat. I use Sally Hanson tough as nails top coat. Then when I need to change them, I just soak them off. Within a couple months, my nails were as healthy as before I started using acrylics.
Amazing video... Hey guys, I just uploaded my video on how to DIY NAILS AT HOME. It would mean a lot if you check it out. If you enjoy the video pls subscribe as I keep posting beauty related videos.  Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Naz_z169sI
I did the water with the nail filler and that messed up my nail filler pretty bad 👎 everything else was helpful tho so thank you
Whicn glue
This worked so well thank you so much
Holy shit. I can’t wait to try this out!!!
3:04 bruhh i bought like 60 of them hell nahh😖i was so stupid
Where can I buy these nails that are clear
I wasn't ready for that nail pic..
Does it work with flour?
what colour nail polish is this? x
I type for a living. Will this last?
Which glue is it? Is it like nail glue?
That was genius-! Thank you × 100😘👍.
If u pick a smaller size it’s going to lift
i want to try this but would the nails not be bendy?
From where u get the nails
Can you use gel polish over this?
Are these nails strong?
WTF? You can totally see the the lines where the tip is. The polished result looks like you made your bed and tucked your sheets in before the polish was dry. Terrible.
Are tips or full fake nails better?
When I do this the cornstrarch mix just comes off
The dislikes are from Nail salons🤣
They look bad the tip is not even blended right
This is absolutely genius. I have a young teenager who is very nail obsessed. She thinks she needs her nails done weekly, and, if you have a knowledge of just how much that costs, well, you get the picture… I refuse to give her what she wants in this area, but, with this idea, I think this may just work beautifully for her! Definitely forwarding it to her and will do this for her, weekly, or anytime she wants if it will get her to hush up about weekly manicures and acrylics!
No offense but you didn't buff them right you can see the tip and the natural nail in the gap sorry
Cant wait to try this!!! Could you do a video showing how to safely remove them after a week or so without damaging your natural nail? Fabulous job!!!!
So where did she get the nail extensions for $4-6?
I know I sound bias saying this but I actually am bias to my nail salon it is amazing! They always push back your cuticles when they first put a set of acrylics on and they also treat your nails before starting the acrylics with a treatment that makes the rips less bad. They always give you the time to choose your color and they put 3-4 coats of polish on and it doesn’t ever look really unatural to me. They cost the top with gel and use tips to extend and then a thin layer of powder on top and you can get them any shape you want just be sure to tell them. They have great service and don’t talk much unless to give you directions or your pay amount.  It is called Fantasy Nails and it is Gastonia NC and if you want the website just let me know!
How are they acrylic if they're not acrylic?
Sometimes I get my nails to look like this naturally lol, but I have to trim them😔
Does it work with baking Soda?
I’m going to try this tonight
they fell off after i ran them through my hair
I actually really like acrylics. Whenever the lady makes mine too thick I always ask her to thin them a little. The only problem I have with them is that when you get them taken off they do tend to take off multiple layers of your nails. 😅
You and Andrea's choice kinda sound alike 😊
What kind of glue do you use
Wow! This is an amazing hack. Can't wait to try it.
Oh my gosh i was just about to get that color but instead i got the clear nail polish
All that work for only a week? And they honestly look lumpy because they are. There's a reason people get acrylic.
Wow I’m gonna have to try this new sub 😊
Hey, here a tip: instead of the plastic extentions I'm gonna try using recicled bottle plastic. I'm not sure it will work, but i'm gonna try 😂
Should these be filled with cornstarch and the clear polish?
Which glue do you use !?
I've been using some fake nails wrong... opps😅😅
Wow I love this
Anyone know what the name of the glue that she used is and where I can get it?
Fuck those bitches (The nails)You lied you said your nails will not get damage!I
Ok
Never have I because the false nails are so thin that is why acrylic is used to make them thicker so they don't chip
Nice! I will try this because I hate those nasty, thick looking acrylic nails and this way your real nails can still breathe and look healthy when you clip the fake ones and apply a new set!
nice
Do the tips snap off easy?
I hate real acrilycs
Your narration is great! Thank you. 💯😊
I don't get the point of putting extra base coat underneath. Wouldn't it just be covered by the color over it?
I tried this a couple of times and it would last about 4-5 days before one popped off. Then my boyfriend saw what I was doing and suggested I coat my whole nail and the tip with the corn starch so it's more stable. If you get a good consistency with the corn starch and nail varnish it goes on smoothly, dries like a rock and you can buff the whole nail into the perfect shape without it being as thick as a lot of acrylics. Lasts a lot longer too!
How Can you take Them of Can you make a video when you take Them of
I stumbled upon your channel and watched your "how to polish your nails" tutorial and I am officially addicted to you girl!! You're very knowledgeable and helpful us newbies!
Which Colour of nail polish u used
i dont recommend using smaller nails tips so u have to push them down for them to fit u cause they just pop off after a day, use ones that are fitted and just file them if u want them smaller
Yeahhhhhh no this is a HORRIBLE way to do your nails and plus it doesn’t look natural you can see the bumps
i’m gonna start using this because i recently saw your fugly to fab hand transformation and the acrylic set you used, damn it is expensive & im not gonna do my nails very often so i don’t see myself investing in it but this was very helpful especially being a 15 year old girl who loves occasionally having acrylics
Can you take those nails off with nailpolish remover? And if you can't then how do you need to take them off? :)
before i start, i don't mean to sound rude or offensive in any way so if i do, i apologise.  okay i just want to criticise a few things in your video (which i am not hating on, its still a great video but you say quite a few misleading things). you should always use nail tips that are slightly BIGGER than your nail than slightly smaller. nail tips can shrink once product is on them and that will either cause a painful c curve or an awkward gap on the side from the tip and the nail. this may seem little but its very unattractive up-close and for people who love perfect nails and pick at them when they're just not right, it will cause a nightmare. while it may be in your opinion, your opinion will not always be correct. for you, your nails may hold similar/identical shapes but for most people I've done nails for, their nails are always very different sizes, widths and shapes, meaning i use different tips for them. also if you use the same tips for them all it causes an unattractive look because your fingers are either bigger or smaller than each-other and your nails are all the same size. your pinkie nail is significantly different from your index and if they had the same nail size, it would quite odd.  don't ever cut your nails with scissors! 1) its painful 2) its damaging to your nail layers, even with tips on it puts strain on your natural nail because the tip is glued to your natural nail now and when the tip bends straight due to strain, so will the natural nail, instead use tip cutter or even curved nail scissors.  3) it will already cause the nail glue to weaken and could make your tips pop off much faster than anticipated.   you should never use a nail file for more than 3 months and i actually think you should replace them before that anyway. they are products that get worn out and not reusable forever. yes when dull, washing them could work but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go out and buy new ones. they still carry bacteria after long uses, and water doesn't remove that. this could cause nail infections. i recommend a glass nail file if you're really not keen on replacing your nail file but if not please make sure that you replace them regularly.  you talk about how you don't have to buff your nails for this but i just want to say that buffing your nails really helps nails stay on longer. yes nail glue is strong but  it'll be stronger when it can bond with a rougher surface. for example, i don't know if you've ever put acrylic paint on a smooth plastic surface but once it dried, that stuff just peeled right off, do this on a rougher surface and it wont. because the paint could go into the bumps and stick down more. same for glue. and buffing your nail isn't damaging.  its only damaging when you do it too much and too often, but it can always be healed/fixed. like when you want to apply an even layer of lipstick on your lips so you use lip scrub to remove anything that can prevent that?   also, acrylics nails come in all types, you can have them thick or thin. and there is a preference to it, so ofc i understand you finding thick nails unfaltering but tell the nail tech you want a thin acrylic set and they will provide that for you. adding to this,  you  talk about the removal of acrylic nails  and showed those pictures of extreme cases. that's not due to the acrylic nails. that's due to either the client not taking the  nails off right, simply ripping them off their nail bed and not soaking them off. or very bad nail salons not removing the nails off properly, if this is the case, you can tell them to stop, and do it correctly (its your body and money, they need to do it how you should get it) also if you don't like how they removed the nails, go to a better nail salon. it may be more expensive but it saves you so much. also, check online for reviews on the salon before even going, ask questions when you book your appointment, don't ever go in blind and regret it. as you said when they drilled your nail it hurt. this could be for many reasons. they're using a too fast setting, the wrong coarseness on the drill. or maybe you get your nails done too many times. or the nails have been removed incorrectly in the past. if the drill hurts, you should tell the nail tech so they can do it better or differently to make it better for you. using an e-file doesn't actually ruin your nails when used correctly  overall  i think the video is brilliant for people who are low on budget and need some pretty nails and fast or even someone who is allergic to acrylic. and ofc beginners to some extent. however, the nails themselves wont last long as you said, about a week or so, and because they're just tips held with a thin layer of cornstarch and polish, they're have a high chance of breaking fast, they're just not strong enough to hold. so i would say they're not practical. and i'm not just saying this, i tried on the method on one hand and i'm quite the practical person and the thumb came off quite fast, only 4 days in. so i really recommend if you do this, add a hard gel on top. it would hold the nail so much better and stronger, and will last longer. and yes i understand the removal of these nails is very simple and easy and this iss probably why so many like them but its worth spending the time removing acrylics or gel nails if they hold together much better and are smoother. yes they're is evident growth but it can easily filled flat and filled in.   anyway thank you for the great video.
does anyone know what the shape is called?
Hi, this was very interesting to watch and I was really hoping I’d find something that would actually work, and I did! But I was wondering if you could sleep with these on or will they get damaged?
Can u plz clarify if you used a clear coat, base coat and top coat ( seperate nail polishes) or its all the same things (one nail polish)
Honey, I hate to break it to ya but those nails look like crap! They don’t even come close to acrylic nails and the pics u showed of acrylics  are a terrible job too. I’m a nail tech and I know a few things about nails. When acrylics are done properly, they look way better than those homemade cornstarch tip nail things u are trying to pass off as “better than acrylics” 😂😂😂😂
Salon acrylics are so overrated tbh. They are so expensive and horrible for your nails. I only do mine at home. This vid was super helpful👍👍👍
For a kid when I got acrylics it was not painful or uncomfortable it was a very good experience and they lasted almost two months
Hi there, I'm new to this press-on nail stuff and have been searching the variables all day..bleh I'm wanting to know what tips you use (brand wise) and why don't you use a full nail press-on? What's the diff?
And I’m finding this in 2019?? Love this video it’s so amazing 😉
Very beautiful
Wow great  jon
I really love you n your work❤️😘thank u.... U're the realest...
Where can you get this kit ?
Im gonna try this..i hate to spend that money at the nail salon and how my nails look when i take them off..im just nervous trying to do my non dominate hand..wish me luck
I want to try these so bad but I have two small children. Are they likely to still last a week??
2019?
How do you remove the tips?
Yes when they file the nail it hurts and the lady i go with makes it hurt
Is this good to just apply to the nails to make the polish last longer like acrylic would?
https://youtu.be/WfS5RzAew1I   Indian nail art talent
Nail fungus here you come.
where did you get the white tips you put on for the fake nails? or where could I get some?
Which glue?
U use bigger than small or they will pop off sickk
Is the base coat 100% necessary??
Am i the only one who feel hurt when she cut those fake nails
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE NAIL POLISH COLOR
Have you been trained? Cause I have and you've said a bunch of untrue things.
0:20 what happened to your finger?😅
girl your videos are addicting ! I cant stop watching them so helpful
You are pure gold, thanks for the tutorial
Can't wait to try this, I bought my supplies last night.  Great video.
Beautiful. Where did you get the nails?
Love this method! Thanks for sharing!
It's really not at home
U CAN WASH YOUR FILES?!! What ive been buying so much new ones 😞
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vnqd1M5oP4 I have a tutorial for longer lasting durable nails check it out
I've seen this a lot of other places..before you uploaded it!
This almost made me lose a nail because they're so flimsy and absolutely too weak to do ANYTHING with.
love this! Thankyou will try❤
Do they stay on like acrylic  doesn't seem like much support.
What glue does she use?
Girl I already tried it and it’s amazing 😉 ❤️ end it was the most helpful nail tutorial I’ve Ever seen ❤️❤️
Alexandra, I love your videos so much! Please do an ASMR video sometime! Your voice is so calming and perfect for it! 😘😘
I’m triggered by the nail drill nail photos. Traumatized.
What glue is that?
ebay is grate for buying fake nails they have 500 nails for 3-5$!
Your's really do look very natural
how to remove fake nail ?
My nails are one of my favorite accessories, I had acrylic nails for 6 months. If your nails hurt after taking them off you nails were either too small or they were taken off improperly. Your nails came out gorgeous btw 😁
Now you got me scared to do acrylics... and I have acrylics on rn... but this helped a lot and I’m really thankful for this! Thank you! ❤️
How long does the cornstarch and nail varnish take to dry???
Another fun fact about thick files, is that they are actually like a bunch of files stuck together... so like when you peel off the top layer that'll be a new file layer underneath you don't have to throw it away and get another one so they're even cheaper Than People realize♡
Using a small tip means that If you are not careful enough they can pop off easily. Also using cornstarch isn’t very helpful for the stress point of your nail. If your nail tech takes off 4 layers of your nail go somewhere else, you’re supposed to soak it off and file the rest off till it’s doesn’t have a shine when you swipe it with a acetone soaked pad. If your nail tech know what they’re doing your nails will not be damaged
I just put on fake nails today to open up presents like a boss lol
I don’t think you made it up Thomas other salons do this sooo
girl.. you really gonna lie to your audience? cornstarch nails do NOT last 10 days and that shape looks wonky as hell. i know that tip is popping off because glue cracks with water and soap. also wtf it does not look smooth for polish application! stop lying omfg this was horrendous. also where was the 'smooth' transition from nail to tip..? your sidewalls aren't even transitioning to the tip as one line.. you also should not be using small tips for every finger. go to the damn salon holy shit acrylics don't damage your nails! stop giving money to techs who file your nails down like crazy. this is a tragic "alternative." anyone who recreated this knows it's fraudulent
Which glue u used at first?
What did u use for the extensions?
And tell me also this nail paint number
Mam plz tell me this powder name and jel name which apply on nail for sticking
THAT'S HELLA TIGHT/COO FHO SHO. THANKX 4 SHARING :)
Ok time to buy a shitton of those 🤑
I love the way u do this keep it up best tutorial ever
I don’t have glue
what glue do u use
how do you take of the acrylic part of (the part you put glue on)
Thank you!!
This is ingenious!
Look at those seams ew
I get my nails done every two weeks and I’m never pained. If you’re going to a good tech there won’t be any complications
Can i use regular flower or baby powder? ( i am allergic to corn starch)
If acrylics are removed correctly they shouldn't be that dammaged
Just amazing
without a build up of product, would those be secure enough?
I say cut it first
Ty I have naturally long nails and I want my nails to look a little longer but not ruin my whole nail
Gel base would work as well as cornstarch and topcoat.
I needed this!  💕
where do you get the nail tips? are there any brands that are good?
Okay.....WHY DO ALL OF THIS WORK WHEN YOU CAN BUY 5 DOLLAR ACRYLIC NAILS ._.
Ughh! Thank you. This was so easy and simple. Thank you!
What is the corn starch mix wit??
Hey how do remove it girl ?
how do you take these off? just nail polish remover? and what kind of nail glue do you use?
Isnt it better transparent tips? Look maybe more natural
Wait did she say $46 or $6
Suzie’s shook
How strong are they??
All wrong you never ever put oils on the cuticle .you always put primer over the filed nail beds .for adhesive ..your supposed to put glue across nail well..fyi ..theres alot of ppl using cornstarch now ..they looked bad
can you use gel polish on this?
How do you remove them ?
I’m on my second set of acrylics atm, I took my first set off after 4 weeks and my natural nails were surprisingly fine? I was able to keep my natural nails long even after acrylics
Does anyone know what she mixes the cornstarch with, I couldn't hear her?
I love how real and down to earth you are. It's nice to finally find a youtuber that knows the content that people actually need ❤❤❤
hi! my question is how exactly would you take these off since it's an original method..? thanks, love you alexandra!
Omg I love you!!!!! I’ve been scared to do acrylics cuz of nail damage so i can’t wait to try this!
Lol didn't work for me atall
Buy empty polish bottles. Add monomer and cornstarch to bottle/dip in acrylic powder or cornstarch and clear polish
What glue do you use? Are you supposed to be filing the fake nail down so it blends with the natural fingernails? How long do you suppose to wait for the nails to dry if you don't have a dryer?
Cornstarch! Revolutionary.
The picture at 2:30 isn’t a picture of drilled nails, thats how your nails look after you bite or pop off your acrylics. The proper and safe way to remove acrylics is by soaking them off. Your nails stay healthy when you soak them.
Im unsubbing. She is a liar. She didnt come up with this when she was 11. Cornstarch nails are a new fad THIS YEAR.
your a show of and soooo ugly
What kind of glue are you using in the video?
You can use flour too (:
Where can I buy the clear stick on nails you used in this video? Also awesome tutorial btw
If you use a nail tip that is smaller than your nail ( like if it “fits” but it’s pushed down all the way like in the video) it will be easier to lift
Omg your voice is so pretty I could watch your videos all day omg
Are the nails waterproof? And does they fall out easily so for example when you play basketball (for school xD)
Wow thx for your videos it just make me so happy that you share your wisdom with us 😂
Do they come off really easy and if not which fingers do come off easy and which don’t .ps I love you ❤️💕
This is like magic ... So good and all natural no acrylic !! Thank you so much !!
The first time I got my acrylics nails done I was 11 almost 11 in September 18 my birthday September 19 so it was actually pretty good I liked it but like the lady was a little bit harsh so yeah
Jesus Christ I swear I’ve been saying this to the nail lady’s FOR YEARS I have wide ass nail beds I want nice elongated feminine looking fingers not big ole fucking chunks on the end so ugly lol
I'm confused, why would you do all that instead of just growing your nails out? My natural nails look exactly the same as your end results, length and shape
Thanks for the tip on how to blend nail tips. Love your nail tutorials. I could watch these over and over again...actually I have lol.
She reminds me of Andreas Choice
I've seen this tutorial before
I have acrylics on right now could I use this method as a fill?
Great video. How do you take them off?
also how do you get the nail tips off?
where do you buy the nail extensions from
How long does the corn flour take to dry after applying it
I am not hating or anything like that I’m just saying, You shouln’t have a tip that is too small if you don’t find one that fits. You should have a tip that is a little big and then file it down to ur size
Can you just build it with out tips??
What are the white things you put on to make your nails look longer? I’m sorry I think this is super obviously but I really don’t know it
How do you take the nails of?
Oh my God my finger is messed up like hers to
that glue doesnt stick very well tho :<
Can you please pray for me and my family because we live in Raleigh nc and hurricane Florence is coming as category 4
This video helped me so much! before i wanted to get acrylic nails.. and now i dont.... i will definitely use your technique
Guys dont remove cuticles! It will cause in infection
Wow that's crazy!!!! Thank you so much for the tips wow I can't wait to try this that's crazy!!!! Cornstarch I love it!!!
Loved it ❤❤❤❤
Yay love how she doesn’t like chunky nails my mom got them done and she didn’t like that they were big
Does anyone know what glue she used to attach it?
Can we mix cornstarch with something eslse than clear nail polish or base/top coat cause i don’t have these anymore
Where can I buy the press on for 6 dollars tho
I like the white tip look...so how n what do you do for that???
Hi what is that oil your using. Just seen ur video. I love it i am definately trying this. Just need to know the oil. I do acrylic on myself but would love more.natural ingredients n love the look
I love this vid you, helped me so much
How long do these last  2 weeks???
What was the brand of nail glue did she use?
Do i have to put base coat
I love your remarks about nails that look feminine and girly vs. Chunky, clunky, and oh so fake. Finally. SOMEBODY gets it.
Can i try whitout cornstatch and put flour?
What type of glue did you use?
where'd she get the fake nails from
i did acrylic nails for a long timw and then one time when i was taking one off one of my nails almost came off
Very detailed tutorial👍🏾😀 There's hope for me!
I loove doing my own nails 💅 I'm gonna give this a try 😅 hope it works
Make sure you do the corn starch thing, I didn't do it and files the layers of my natural nail. It hurts and is very weak, So do it!
I love acrylics but my mom won’t bring me to get them done 😡
I've tried nails like this but it's not good. Glue this in you nails it's bad
OMFG THANK YOU😭
The first picture of the acrylic nails looks exactly like my moms 😂
Are they water proof?
Does anyone else think that if she didn't color her nails they would have looked like French tips and they were so beautiful
Yeaaaah I hate that trend too having oversized nails ,those people are just stupid
for me, i just completely stopped getting acrylics because my nails are already thin and hanging the acrylics removed DESTROYED my nails
Yes I wore nails and it wasn't to hard because I had shot round nails
Thats amazing I hate the nail filing  and sometime not even worth it.
Can do this with any fake nails like the ones  with design on them already.
Omg, yes! That thick chunky look is awful! Why do women like that? I will never understand. Thank you for saving me $$$ and giving me a solution for a natural looking nail.
Can we use flour instead?? I don’t have cornstarch
I love your voice so much,...
Can u please tell me which glue  .. clear nail polish and cornstarch u have used .. from amazon or any other sight .. please
THIS IS GREAAT
these are beautiful! what kind of glue did you use? 💗
Great video! Very helpful
oh my god, finally someone who thinks thick and chunky thick nails looks bad
I hate getting acrylics, but I love the way they look. I've only gotten them twice, but the second time it took out chunks of my nails so now my nails look like they got smashed at the top. Thank you for this tutorial
I absolutely love this tutorial,  really well delivered and fantastic results.. Excellent.. I get bored of long nails really fast so this is PERFECTO
Just saying if the nail technician is hurting u with the file then u have to say something or else they won’t know they are doing it. Also the majority of those photos have drastically over dramatised how ur nails will look once the acrylics are professionally taken off and it’s a slim chance ur nails will look like that unless u try to take them off at home. I personally have been wearing acrylics constantly for over a year getting them done every 3-4 weeks and I had to get them taken off for a surgery and my nails a perfect, they are still very long and with a some nail strengthening treatments and nails oils my nails have been in complete perfect condition ever since.
Honestly after my acrylics (from the kiss acrylic nail kit) my nails arrent even brittle or damaged
has anyone had any problems with removal? And how do you remove them?
As a nail tech I am a little horrified by this video. I can't even begin to tell you how badly your nails can be damaged simply because you have no upper arch and no support. Acrylics cause damage when they are applied or removed in the wrong way. 90% of the time they are bitten or torn off by clients, causing severe damage to the natural nail. Find a proper nail tech.
They look natural  and beautiful
I will be trying this out. I was a nail tech. and I know how damaging acrylic is to nails. Thanks for the tip I love your channel :)!
My nails are super thin so they usually don't have to buff them that much, but the weight of the acrylics usually makes my fingers sore.
So many people talk about this method
WE HAVE THE SAME NAILS LOL
I don’t have clear nailpolish, so can I USE blue or white nailpolish??
Has anyone tried this without tips?? If you did, please let me know if it worked and how did it. Thanks!!
Anything other than cornstarch you can use??? Cant find any in the UK 😂
2 years later and I’m still watching this! ❤️
QUESTION: are they easy to come off? also its joys running the top part with the glue correct ? not the whole nail? I have thin nails and acrylics get expensive !
I love her voice :)
I have a question what if you put you hands in water regularly? Will it come off easily
I love u for this idea...bcz when ever I thought for long nails that damaged nails and pain next day threatened me ...but this looks better..can try this...😍🤩
Nice works love your tutorials .
And if your nails look crusty after removal like mine do, just get a pair of spandex gloves, fill them with oil & leave them on your hands for 15 minutes :) helps a lot
I just tried this and it’s amazing!!! My nails look beautiful & professional. I will never pay for acrylic nails ever again thanks to this tutorial. 👍🏽😉😄
My sister has been doing this method for years. She loves it. Also, I'm not being mean or anything I really love you and your videos.. But other people have done this way before this video. Idk what you meant when you said you came up with this.  But I love your videos.
Where do you get the clear nails packets
I love your videos but don’t get me wrong from all the videos I watch and questions from my nail tech they say get a nail bigger rather than smaller bc you can file it down to your nail size and if you use a nail smaller then the nails r going to pop off... Second who ever buffs your nails out with a drill and your nails hurt or burn the next day they need to get fired or there just bad at doing nails bc that’s never happened to me or any body I know....
The reason why I watch these vids because to see how satisfying it is when as soon as they apply that nail polish onto there acrylics like if you agree😍
My question is, how easy do the pop off or break? I work in a plant and always get acrylic put over my natural nail (NO TIPS) with gel polish.. they never break.. but I would love to try this but only if they wont just snap off like press ons
I really wanna do this.  but what was the liquid that was mixed with the cornstarch
“no one else will have this turtorial” LIES
Threw my nail file,  exactly like yours in the bin! Raging!
No offense or hate but I don't think you were the one who created this method
I'm 10 and I have acrylic nails and they don't hurt
Thank you for this tip🙏🏽🙏🏽
You aren’t meant to drill your actual nail 🤢If they drill your actual nail it is a fake acrylic.
I watched a different video and it said this method was bad because it doesn’t give support since the tip is the only part that is glued on...is this true or not?  Have you ever had it break off painfully?  And how do you get your nails to dry with 4 coats? I want to try this method but have these few questions!
They only peel like they if you force them off. If you soak them in acetone they turn into mush and scrape right off. There has actually been studies done that show that if everything is done properly (application, maintenance, and PROPER removal) acrylics, gels, fiber glass/silk is perfectly safe for your nails and nail beds. All of this stigma comes from people not properly maintaining their manicures. I have had my nails done for years, home manicure (with press-ons and super glue) salons (gels and acrylics) and now back home with UV gels and my nails are perfectly fine. I have naturally extremely thin paper nails and I have never experienced this. Just like everything else. It isn't going to the salon and done. Do you get your hair done and then not brush or wash it? Don't blame something that is actually not the problem. Did you use brushes to clean your nails? Did you soak or nails in acetone for 10-20 minutes after filing the nail polish off? If not, try it. Bet it won't be so bad.
Can you do this without tips to have strong nails? I.E. the cornstarch mix.
ive been getting coffin nails for a long time there my favorite but i stoped getting them with acrylics because they damage my nails alot so i started getting gel coffin nails
Where can i buy the nails? Maybe Walmart?
Sigh I should do this from now on. I wanted to believe in professional acrylics, was super careful with them. But the cons kinda outweigh the pros. Chunky, expensive, look weird when grown out, only lasted a week no matter how much I avoided hazards, and the day before I actually have to go to a formal event and might actually need them, they are all gone. (Except my thumbs where the glue randomly worked but since they are alone they have to be cut down) AND now I'm just left with drilled up nails that I have to paint over or revive some how.
Thank you sooooo much my mom would never let me do it so now I finally know
Hi, is this paper???
This video was literally so helpful!! I LOVE getting acrylics done but it's super pricy! I find it so cool that you can do this at home :) thanks for sharing
Corn starch n clear polish n nails correct and Nail glue
What do I need to buy and where please?
Did this yesterday and it worked really well.  Just some hacks: •file your nails gently before sticking on the tips, otherwise the oils in the nails will make the tips fall off •do 2 layers of cornstarch, making sure the first layer has fully dried and that you filed it before second coat
I hate it when its damaging my nails like it was pain
girl you are amaaazinng
Can you let me know what color you used for your nails they look really nice thanks
YOU ARE AMAZING!!!!!!! Thank you 😊 ❤️❤️and i looove your voice!!
Were did you get the clear tips??
Why dont you just use full tips? Then you dont have to fo the cornstarch thing. The rest is sl the same and you can choose to place them with nail clue or with stickers
Can this Cornstarch concoction be used on the whole nails if i just want my naturals nails to be thickened a bit.
when I got my acrylics they didn't hurt at all but they didn't do the acrylics right tho
Which products did you use and where did you buy them?? X
Would a nail overlay work the same way? I naturally have long nails anyway just want to be able to wear polish without it chipping so quickly
Trying this in a week cause I’m on a budget 😂💕💕
how do you remove it
What nail glue did you use
How do you remove them?
Plus people usually don’t get acrylic nails for them to look natural 😂🤷🏻‍♀️
It isn’t good to use tips smaller then your nail because they will eventually lift and crack and potentially crack your nail tip underneath as well. Also corn starch is most likely only going to last a week at most. When you go to the salon just ask for your nails to be thin and slender if not I recommend nail techs who work from home because the ladies at the salon usually don’t listen lol.
So Glad my mom was a nail stylist :3
This is stupid sorry
If you went to get acrylic nails and the tech drilled down your natural nailbed,you went to the wrong tech.They just buff it,they don't drill down your own nail.
I used to use them in the 80's,but they would never stay on too long,even with crazy glue...
Where did you get the tips?
Hurts my nails when I try anything involving my hands. Turns out lumpy too even if you filed it to be even. Oh and it ISNT good to wash your file with water. Water actually makes it softer and that’s not what you want.
I still have dents and nail scars on my nails from acrylics I had 2-3 months ago.🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Can you tell my all the tools you used
What is the ingredients
can I use flour instead of cornstarch???
Where do you get the nail Extensions
These helped me soooo much to fix one of my nails which had no acrylic on cause it popped off
As a licensed nail tech for 25 years, this makes me cringe.
I am digging this color 😍😍
Thank you! I’ve been looking for this everywhere!
I fricken love this vid !!!
So bumpy
What is the nail color you used? I loved it!
All the cretins saying acrylics dont cause damage, are you joking? Because you literally have to file the nails down so the acrylic will adhere (which is damaging no matter how you look at it)
I wish I had come to your video before I went out and bought acrylic nail powders.
But why can’t you just use fake nails I use the kiss brand and they last for like a week and they are only 6 dollars to and you can paint them to all you have to do is we glue them on
woowww so fast hehe thnk you for sharing i love it..
What nail glue do you use? Are there special types that are better for your nails than others?
I have gel I've never had acrylics I don't wanna have an infection at my finger
Hey. Do you know how to remove fake nails?
Thank you this is perfect for my niece
Can you use gel  nail polish and cure it after
How do you take them off?
Bitch stop hating on my nails
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼love it😘
Can i use flower? Instead of cornstarch
Safer, no infection, no acrylics, save money. Gorgeous!
if someone’s nails look like that after removing their acrylics, it’s because they ripped them off. it has nothing to do with them being drilled
What are the materials you was using to prep your nails.
Holy shit, your nail videos are LIFE CHANGING.
You're so informative on your videos I love them 😩😍
Cute but they don't last.
those horror photos of acrylic nails are very misleading as well. looks like she googled worst nails after acrylics. If you have a good nail tech that doesn't happen to the nail bed. check facts guys.
so cornstarch is replacing acrylic. yeah ok.
They won't last not even 24 hour honey...
Very creative but does this work for mommies that washes dishes all tha time??? Mmm🤔.... But cute tho but acrylic is going to hardened and stay hard...
These are ugly
They aren’t ment to drill your nail
I want to do this because it doesn't cover all the nails 😍 because covering all the nails will prevent water to reach my nails.
Is there any alternative to cornstarch?
Y’all. I’m dead. You know how many god damn files I’ve thrown out!
how do you take them off??
https://youtu.be/RqBe5TI9ERo there's a lot of other videos about this see lol
If you don’t want them to file your whole nail down get tips, they hurt a lot less and come out looking the same as a full set
Thank You, i'll do this for sure. Love from México.
Is it just me or does she sound like @AndreasChoice?
Where did you buy the tips
I’m doing this right now;)
How do I take it off?
Very bias
What kind of glue
can u do a full acrylic nail
Thanks homegirl this is dope.
So I ordered my nails and I love it!!! They break but doesn't hurt!!! Mine last about a week and a few days but I'm a little harsh on my hands but they're VERY cost efficient & pain free!!!
can you use baking soda instead of corn starch?
Will this work to fill in salon nails? I was looking for a cheaper solution and this came up.
I love the look of acrylics but when I got them everything was good and then one broke off and my real nail basically came off with it
That's pretty cool
I play  basketball so  I still trying this
what glue do you use?
What glue do you use
Hi how long should the corn starch dry.
What tools did you use and where can I get them
As a nail tech, this makes me cringe.
love it
I love it.. Amazing
Wooaaaaahhhhh this is amazing 💖 thank you so much for sharing 💖
Can you cut them before you glue them to your nails?
ok am done,imma go to the dollar store and get those yellow already made ones ;-;
what is that white thing ?
Now that my real nails are completely damaged and thin from getting fills back to back for the past year of 2017.. I'm definitely going to do this !!! I also ordered some really cute pre-designed press on nails from urban outfitters too! Thank you for your nail hack videos !
Can i use my natural nails?
Is there a alternative you can use if you dont have corn starch
Great idea! Very genius and more natural. This is going to be my new way of doing my nails from now on. No more smelly acrylic fumes and no more damaged nails! I love this idea. :) And let me just say.... super smart how you don't have to keep doing "fill-ins" as your nail grows. I love it :)
@ Susie from her PROFESSIONAL NAIL CHANNEL lmao  She did this ish with polish and gel polish and it didn’t work good at alllll
i hated getting them buffed down the person i wnt to looked away and hit my skin and cut my finger
Thank you sooo much... you saved meh!! 🤪💜
Follow me on my chanel at dreamqueenmiya
You’re stupid this method is all over YouTube. you have not been doing this if you were 13. You probably just saw a video and calling it your own just to get views.
The original cornstarch falsies tutorial
THE FIRST CORNSTARCH VIDEO I EVER WATCHED OVER A YEAR AGO!!! 😊😊😊   it’s 2017 and it has now become a trend lol, wow.... everytime I see a video of cornstarch nails I think of you!!! ❤️
https://youtu.be/H9x22fSxb34
and here i am moulding blue tack on my nails
i stopped going to a nail tech because well, for several reasons: in addition to the pain from drilling or the risk of them nicking my fingers, they hurt like hell when they break, they're expensive and they never came out the way i like. i think i'll really give this a try! i had to wait until my damaged nails grew out some but the thought of going back to a salon just makes my fingers hurt! so i'll save the $50-60/month and try this instead!
Would this also work with flour?
How long does the cornstarch take to dry once u put it on ur nails??
EVERYONE IS MAKING VIDEOS OF THUS METHOD AND NOT GIVING U CREDIT😭
Hey awesome video!! What glue did you use? And can you use gel polish over top?
can you do a almond nail
Actually, to make it more even, you could actually just apply a layer of clear polish/top coat and put corn starch over it and repeat it like 2 or 3 times and then let it dry and then you could buff it to make it even more even i think that would look super good! Thnx Alexandra im definitely trying this out <3
Omg yessssss. So clean and easy. I did it and I’m like....✋🏽 (on fleek nails) 🤣
For everyone asking, I tried this: -Yes, you can use flour, just make sure there are no lumbs in it -Yes, you can do it if the cornstarch is expired (mine was expired for just about 5 months) -You can remove these with nail polish remover (it will only dissolve the cornstarch-polish mixture, to remove the tips you will need tip-remover) -Mine lasted about 1 to 1 1/2 weeks  Have fun trying these :)
That was really good i dont no how to do acrylic in this is a good method
Does the glue damage your natural nails?
I WANT A STILETTO PLEASE
Hey great video, how do you. Remove the nails?
Help!! While in the shower, my cornstarch nails literally started to peel off. Like the polish was peeling off.. :( how do I keep the cornstarch nails from getting like that? I’ve noticed that when I put them in water, the cornstarch starts to unharden 😿 so sad because I did those last night and I had to take them all off after my shower because they all got ruined 😿
I love the look but my only problem is what if the glue loosens and u Loose a nail? 😰🤧
I did the cornstarch hack....no go....nails popped off right away.
Nice! Checkout my attempt at cornstarch nails!  Like x Subscribe to my channel for more content!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBEmDgLonEg
Can potato starch work lol
Can we leave the nail on like a french tip without nail polish??
what Nail Polish color is this?
This was so amazing!!! Thank you so much girl!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I literally just bought tips! So helpful!
Can someone tell me how to remove them
I might have to try this!  I'm allergic to something in acrylic nails.  Not exactly sure what it is but I've tried everything and every time I have a reaction to it.  This seems like a good option for me!
The only thing no one is mentioning is trying to open something with a tab or using the nail for anything. I bought something and tried to peel up the sticker off of it and the nail bent. The tip wasn’t sturdy at all.
I want to do this but, do they come off too easily? like for the glue, can it make the fake part come off? i had fake nails before, and i couldnt have them on for more than i think 2 days because i had gym class and they popped off :/
wow! so nice i tried it i love it!!!
How come I could see the tip when I polish 😩
It all depends on where you go, i love wearing acrylic nails, and the drill never hurts my nails, You just went to the wrong people.
OMG!!! This is amazing!!!!!!!
i had my nails done about a month ago and prior to that 5 years because i don't like the damage to the nail - filing down already think nails.  thanks for sharing.  i want to try this.
Quick tip guys! If you go to a nail salon and they dremel your nails (use the machine) and it hurts... they are doing it wrong.
Loved this vid but u didn’t come up with it xx
The photo of the nails 'How they look when accrylic is removed' Isn't correct. That is damaged nails from the liquid acrylic MMA.
You just save me a whole lot of money, plus I hate the drills that nail techs use.
Omg!! This is exactly what I was looking for!
I can’t wait to try this on my daughter she loves nails !! Thank you
Can you use flour ?
How long do these last?
What kind of glue?
Im definitely gonna try this!
I wish I could do this but I work with dogs lol
When I was 13...we made fake nail tips out of cardstock. We were cool enough to think of this....this amazing.
I want to try these but I don’t think I can do both hands on my own 😭
Where did you get the extensions???
How do you remove them?
The chunky nails are ugly. And this is a good idea. However, you can see a definite ridge where the tip attaches to your natural nail.
Wow..i have been wanting to get my nails to this shape..i looooove it...😍😍
Your channel is everything❤️❤️❤️❤️
My life was changed forever when she said wash the file. I am shook
This video saved my life
heyyy
A good nail technician won't damage your nails when you get acrylics, they should just buff the shine off not drill 4 layers of your nail off. These look clumpy and gross, just buy some glue on nails and skip this. They last about the same and look better than this.
Do you have a recommendation on how to make already natural long nails keep from breaking? Like I don’t mean vitamins. I have natural long nails but once they hit their sweet spot, the corners begin to break. Friends tell me to get gel or acrylic over them but I hate how they buff the nails out thin. I’ve also tried keeping nail polish on but they will begin cracking and break after a certain length.
Only a week?
Great idea and very creative! Except, they look super bumpy and the texture does not look smooth at all
Wow!!! I just started watching your vidos. And they are AMAZING!!! I don't get bored at all watching them. I love u some much and keep up the hard work.💟💞💟💟💟💞💞💖💗💟💖💖❤💕💝👏👏👏
so we use just regular nail glue?
Great
I’ve tried this and every time I tried they would pop off or come home within 30 minutes. What am I doing wrong? Do u have an advice or tips for them to let long without them falling off my nail??
I always thought that acrylic nails were chunky and way too expensive. Now I have a cheap and cute way to do my nails!! Thank you so much.
I tried this last night & it totally worked. They turned out great!
I tried this like 3x and they always pop off or come off when I do things. What am I doing wrong? Or is there any advice for them to stay on without them falling off
Could you cut and shape the nails before you attach them?
nice
Every time I get acrylics done at a salon, I tell the person doing my nails to go easy on the buffing, because I have thin nails, and without fail, they follow instructions. No pain, and the nails still last for close to a month. Only down side is that with less buffing means less that the acrylic can adhere to, and eventually they will pop off if you work with your hands and don't get them filled, which I never do because I'm usually broke. Hence, diy faux-acrylic video.   Love this video by the way, if I may, how long have y'all gotten these to last? Also, that's the ratio of cornstarch to polish?
dfg
This is a great idea!
I found your channel by looking up how to do my nails. I did them tonight they aren't all that good but they look alright. I love you video and step by step you did. Thank you for making this video.
Nail tips+Nail polish+Clear Nail polish+Nail filer+cornstarch = Almost same price as the nail salon. Will try anyway. Stupid asian nail techs always try to get the most $ out of you for just a cm more in length. And they've made my cuticle bleed twice. Very unprofessional. I'd say grounds for a lawsuit. Not to mention unsanitary.
I like
Is this brand cruelty free & vegan?
Such an amazing video :)
Where did you get the nail extension (the white thing)
Are they sharp at the tips? Worried about hurting my baby.
I want to try this but my Mom & Dad wont let me by the stuff & they say you're to yung. :(    Allso  who watches                  S A O                                I love anime :)
It is very easy, nice and cheap. But if you'll use this method is doesn't look acrylic, it will look more like the fake nails you buy from the store. But no hate, pretty smart & cheap.
Does this work with flour
My nails are extremely short! Will they work on very small finger nails?
Where do u get the fake nails from?
I watched this even though I already had acrylic nails
The only problem I do my left nails perfect but right not perfect like left😭
I tried this and it doesn't work very well
How do you remove these??
How do you get 'em off??????
I always do nail. Ur one thing is that I can't only do my nail with my right hand and I can't do my right hand with my left hand help
Omg. You saved my nails' life
I would do this but I do karate and we punch ALOT so I feel like the nail would come off asap
in my school we cant have long nails.WHATTTTTTZ
Oh noooo who keep their acrylics for only a week??  😴
So many girls are posting this getting the credit
She has such pretty hands ♡
instead of clear nail polish with the corn starch could I use brush on nail glue then apply the corn starch?
I live in England  and have no corn starch how about corn flour x
You realise that the products shrink that’s why you go bigger it can actually damage some people
can you use full nails instead of tips?
Love this!!!!! Thank you!!!! I have glue on nails, but I'd like to save them for special occasions cause there really expensive. So, could I get these at a dollar store or something? Or are they only at like Walmart and stuff. Thanks😊
can you list the products you have used? the glue, the nails, the nail polish brand, etc.
I got tips for $2 at the dollar store
girl this is such a good idea, i used to spend alot of money buying fake nails and the glue would mess up my nails but i fr wanna try this and try and make my nails look natural, ur a genius!  ❤
Our these nails durable for sports
How much is to much cornstarch??
Did u paint the clear tips white for this video? Or did u not use the clear tips?  I want to try this! Thank you for sharing :):)

THANK YOU SO SO MUCH THIS CHANGED MY LIFE!
How do you take them off?

Thank you❣👏🏾My homecoming is literally 2 days from now and I was in need of getting my nails done but didn't have the time or money for it but this should do the trick☺
Thank you so much! I love this! I need long nails for my Halloween costum and I really didn't want to destroy them. But this way I can get the look and keep them healthy :)
can i do french mani with this method or would they look weird? 😊
The acrylics that I have right now doesn’t hurt the only part I didn’t like was the buffing but it didn’t hurt and they didn’t shave to much off just ask not to get it filed to long
😲 definitely trying this loves it thanks
Hi, what kind of glue do you use and where do you get it?
How do you remove them? I’ve pulled mine off it hurts I’ve got one hand to go and it’s like owwww
the only problem Is that i play volleyball every day and soccer o well
Can you type with these? Wash dishes? Or clean?
This is epic!! Thank you for sharing!! Off to buy some clear nails!
I have to ask. What must that feel like when your break one? Also how long does all that work last for?
Idk what kind of nail u went too. But acrylic nails shouldn't ruin ur natural nails.

What kind of glue do you use for this?
How long do these last?
What nail glue did you use? 😃 I'm not sure if you mentioned it @AlexandrasGirlyTalk
What makes these better than traditional press on nails
oh gosh, i hope the nail techs no not to drill THE WHOLE NAIL!
How can you actually remove acrylic nails??
Thank you💜
I tried this and I absolutely love it.  You're a genius!  Thank you for sharing.  I haven't had my nail done in 6 years because the acrylic salon nails destroyed my nails.  My daughters wedding is coming up in a month and I wanted my nails to look super nice.  Your step by step tutorial and the fact that you don't use that acrylic powder stuff and glue is awesome!  With a little more practice my nails will look fabulous for my daughter's wedding. Thank you!  🙏💕
Omg I've been spending so much on having fake nails and now I can get the for next to nothing. This video has definitely changed my life thank you
Your not saving the nail from damage when your put glue on your nails.
Everytime i do this method, i can still see my nail bed and it doesnt look natural at all... but other than that, this method is perfect!
How you remove this off ?
Flower work
Where do you get the plastic extension pieces?
Looking forward to trying this!
I prefer Acrylic. . I like strong claws. . this look cheap and easy to brake. . I need a strong nail that's not going anywhere! !!! lol  we all have our preferences and A+ for creativeness!

I'm 16 and my mom still won't let me get fake nails any tips ?
I know I'm late, but I would like to know if it matters if I don't have the same cornstarch and nails..etc
What kind of glue are you using?
Honey she is about to put the nail business OUT of Business lol😂
Too much time too much work
Can you use gel over it?
I'm going to do this when I break my natural nails. they are short right now. I don't like the way my hands look with short nails. and when I do the press ons, they only last a day, three at the most lol. and I wanted to try acrylics, but didnt want to ruin my natural nails, so thank you for this video. 😊👍👌
But why do those look like my real nails lol
are they weak though? I know acrylics are a bitch to get off but they're really strong and that's why I like them. is there any way to make this method give you strong nails like acrylics??
I have known about this method and this video for a long time but I just now tried it myself. I really like how my nails turned out but I have one question... How do I take these off? Is there a better way than killing my nails in acetone for 20 minutes hahah😂
Ew!, You sound transgender. Oops wrong channel
Nice Diy, however cornstarch too messy for this
What do I need to do them nails x
My name is alexandria
I started acrylic at 7 years old
what did you use to prep your nails at the beginning?
Most people say that it dosent hurt getting acrylics but she just said it hurts lol I don't know which one it is
How do u remove it
Love acrylics
How do i remove these??
Can I use a clear top coat instead of a clear polish?
I have seen so many of these videos, and this is the only one that helped❤❤❤
could you do the stiletto tutorial??
What is the glue you are using?
Thanks so much for this video. I just did it and your totally right. It's much healthier and prettier than any acrylics!
thankyouuuuu for thiss
What Glue are you supposed to use?? I really need to know? (I'm a Girl😂)
What glue did you use? Because I've gotten those fake nails at Claire's with the glue and if you get glue on your skin well , it kinda stays there , and I don't want that but wanna try out this tutorial!
but mine were the whole nails not tips
I used a old kit and some nail glue I found and they didn't even stick for a day they kept popping off and I had to glue them on every single time,  ima try it again with a new kit but anybody know how to keep them on?
Hey! Would these last longer if gel polish was used? X
but how sturdy are they for everyday activities
My nails are so sensitiv..I absolutely hate that drill because it makes my nails break.
Who else wants acrylics really badly but doesn't have money and your parents won't let you anyway 😐
What type of glue do u use
I have 2 questions  1: how do you make them thinner  2: how do you take them off?
So she just use clear polish and cornstarch or was the clear polish something else. Plz help
Actually, I would pay you to do this for me!!
How long do they take to dry and what's the ratio of cornstarch to polish???
if it not involve acrylic then it's not acrylic nails!
Big thumbs up. Great idea and thanks for sharing. I might try it. Right now though, loving the dip systems which strengthen without the damage. They last longer than a week - up to three.
How long will it stay?
I have like no nails will this work for me ???
U should open up a nail shop because you are so right about going to the nail shop not being healthy.
its so hard for me to get the nail in the right place wtf
I'm confused cus I bought the clear nails in the video but they came as full coverage nails, not tips like she's using in the video!! Not what I wanted and idk how to cut the to curve inward like that
What if the size don't fit no more
Where do you buy the tips from ?
Omg its amazing great job and thank you for sharing this method I ❤ them
So I bought the Kiss Acrylic set and decided that I didn't want to damage my nails with the drill or inhale those nasty chemicals when I came across your tutorial and so, I tried it out on my pinky nail. It worked quite well and the results were great! That said, because the 'filler' is made of nail polish, when I eventually remove the nail color/design in a week, do I have to 'fill' the area or do you just paint over it? I would imagine nail polish remover would likely damage the bond created with the polish/cornstarch slurry. I should add that I don't like super long nails, I just like them slightly longer than my finger tips, but my natural nails break all the time so I like to use the tips. Thanks for your assistance in advance!
Omg girl I think u just gave me LIFE👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Omg yes!!!!!💗🙌🏻
Me and my brothers girlfriend did this bc she really wanted acrylics and IT WORKED it took I'd all day but it was worth it. It didn't look like yours bc we were beginners but it was fine. Thank you so much this is awesome
Is itvpossible to do this at home with natural nails?
5:34 my mom would kill me
Every time I get acrylics done they fall off within a week, I tried everything. My nails don't hold them at all
can i use gel nail polisch instead of acrylic
i use straws because i am broke and lame af
What kind of glue did you use?
my turned out like shit :(
Does the nail glue damage your natural nail at all?
This helped a lot thank you sm💖
This is so amazing I am definitely doing this once I get home ❤️ Thank you for this amazing tutorial 😊
Were did you got the fack nails
My nails are soo long
Ok, as someone in beauty school if your nails look like that after using a drill on them then you need to find someone better to do your nails for your because nails should never look like that.
girl this actually works I love u it bomb slayed my nails
What is all the products you use
What kind of glue do I use. Is there a special nail glue or nah
oh its cornstarch
where u get the powder n liquid from
I love acrylics were alike I started wen I was 9 but do my own as 13 and go to the nail shop I love nails nails nails
Can you do this to your nails every week if they last one week? Ps sorry if the question is confusing
So happy to chance upon this!!
Liked it!! Thanks sooo much girl<3
What is the nail polish you used in this video? Love it!
I love your channel! I like that you try to use as many natural and easily available products as  well as use non abrasive methods.
I really want acrylics but I'm 13 and every place that I live near me says you have to be 16 or older but I thought acrylics last like 3 weeks do they HELP PLZ?!
How do u get the nail off?
My mom walked in my room and thought the mixing of cornstarch and top coat was coccain. She was like "WHAT IS THAT" lmao💀
Hmm. I love acrylics and my nails have never looked chunky. If your nail tech does your nails a certain way and you don't like it, you can always just communicate. Just tell them you want to slim the sides down. Don't pay for something you don't like. But I like this alternative for younger girls
This is the best video I've ever watched I always wanted acrylics and can't get them bc if the price I love this video and keep watching it but I have one question could you put cornstarch in the clear nail polish bottle
I absolutely love this!
How do u remove them?
did she use nail glue
What brand of glue was that ? And where can I get those nails ?
how do you take them off?
when i get my nails done they just fall off after about 2 weeks
how do you remove these without damaging your real nails?
WOW subscribed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love painting my nails and doing acrylics... the only downside is when it comes to using my non dominant hand😩😭
so the nail glue is removable with normal Aceton based nail polish?
cool video. FYI I found a set of 80 tips at the dollar store today.
i thought she was making an acrylic nails....... :( :( :( i realy dont have acrylic nails....
I loved this methodI did my nails exactly like u did it and I loved it  😊 all i got to say is thank you 👌
What glue is used????
i have been doing this since i was 12 years old also 😂💪
I will sub any one who will sub me!
Love it... finally  a less expensive way to do my nails. thanks you so much for sharing!!
Does it have to be cornstarch it can it be something else? Thank you X
u basicly wear fake nails...
I've never learnt so much from one video!
How do u remove them???
When I go to get acrylics they don't file my nail with a drill they use a block and they never really try too hurt it and they always make them look good and I love them 😍
Ahhh I don't have cornstarch can I use something else?
I don't have any nail glue or corn starch what can I use for my nails and can I use flour for the acrylic?
what store can i buy the fake nails at?
I tried and it worked very nicely I even shared if with other people. The removal is really simple and your nails always remain healthy. I honestly love this tutorial
Ugh! Yes! I hate getting acrylics because I feel like they're always oversized and so unfeminine!
THAT'S USING ACRILYI S
What glue do you use?
This is the best nail video. I was going to return a nail kit a recently got. I am going to save it and do this!
I'm so excited and going to try this ASAP! I have two requests please :)  1) Can you share a link on how to do pointy (stiletto) nails in this treatment? 2) Can you share links to the products you used? Tips, nail glue, top coat etc  Thank you!
I get so frustrated when people bitch at acrylics,gels,the nail drill etc, it does nor ruin your nails ,it's incorrect removal thar ruins nails, this idea is food if you like it I'm not saying anything against the method but please don't bitch about how others so theirs. I've bee doing acrylics and gels for over 20 years now and my nails haven't dropped off yet, even when I wear them natural they look lovely.lovely video , great nails
thanks!!!Worked!
Can you use flour? lol
how strong will they be when using cornstarch vs acrylic
I  am a nail tech and I am telling you, if your nails  look like the pic you just showed (after the filing) they are disgusting, I have never taken "4 layers off" you are obviously going to the wrong places. They should never look like that:(
How long do these last?
BEST CHANNEL EVER
this is vewied than the cash me out side how bow that 😂😂
people always say to go a size up and i always did a size smaller and it looked so much more real finally someone who understands 😂
I love the French manicure with just the white tips ❤️
What kind of glue did she use? Just regular glue?
IT DIDNT WORK!!!!
do one with short/bitten nails please!
me
Do you have to use gel polish when doing acrylics?
I've been a nail tech for 26 years and not impressed by much but this is a wonderful tutorial! I hand filed my work 100%....if you hurt during the filing, make them stop and hand file...if they say no or make up excuses....find someone else....seriously.
Thank you. Just thank you
*when you have everything in this tutorial* <3
OMG I am so late to see this video...  this is the best video in whole YouTube about Acrylic nails
Where did you get the set of clear nails?
this didn't work :(
Let me start of by saying I never try anything i find on youtube 😂 but this worked AMAZINGLY!! at first I didnt file the tops enough where the cornstarch was and then painted, but i just removed the paint and refiled. they feel really sturdy even tho its only on half my nail too. thanks girl! didnt want to pay 40+ bucks to get my nails done!!
I have had my nail filed down with a drill and they never looked like that....
That picture is such bullshit my nails never looked like that after acrylic nails and having them drilled and I didnt even get them soaked off I ripped them off myself so 😂
what is the color she used called?
what is the color she used called?
Look at her recents she doesn't where them she wears acrylic and how does she know what they do at salons if she can't afford it
Yeah but it lasts three hours if you go to school or have a job or play a sport   Also   Nail glue $5  Nail polish $10  Tips $5  Cornstarch $5  File $5  Extra Nail Polish Design or Accent $10  Base Coat $5 Total Cost $50  Only last me 1 day  Got my acrylic nails done yesterday for $30 including tip and they look gorgeous and will last me 2-3 weeks. (IK this bc my friend got hers done at the same salon 3 weeks ago and she plays sports and her nails look good still)  Your Welcome
Actually I got my acrylics today and the drill that buffs the nail didn't hurt that much
How did you get these off!
Why isn't the thumbnail the thumbnail?
can u use baking soda??
I tried and I messed up so badly! oh well,  It looked so lumpy. lol
your nails look so beautiful
So helpful❤️
I've had some fake nails and they hurt when you take them off it takes a long time to take them off
how long did this take you?
What color is that?! The nail polish? All I saw is the brand
What acrylic nails did u use and where can I get them? They were a white color and looked different from the clear ones u showed before
I'm going to give this a go what did you mix your cornstarch with? You said clear nail polish? Is that base coat? Top coat? Nail hardener? I've never actually seen clear nail polish anywhere. Thanks
Do these nails last in pool water? I want to wear them to the beach, but idk if they'll last.
Can I use the corn starch and clear nail polish as nail glue
YESSS GIRL!!! This video is so amazing!  You really know how to help a sister out especially one on a budget <3
They look lumpy....
I'm just begging doing my own tips, this tutorial is a big help! Thank you!  I have found that if you use gel polish (with or without the uv light) that you'll get about an extra 5-10 days out of your tips!
Have you done a Stilletto nail tutorial yet???? I nEED it
You add the most important details in your videos 👍👍👍
Can you use water instead of clear polish? Or any other color polish?
I love your method
I am unsure what are you using instead of acrylics nails..  would love to try them ...
Can you do this same look with gel nail polish? Would the UV lamp melt the tips?
can you use baby powder for this?
I'm curious wouldn't the nails be so thin and bendy?
Could you please tell me what would happen if you just mixed acrylic powder with the nail polish rather than using corn starch.
Can I use any fake nails?
U saved my life ... 😇
I love how u do this!! it's genius! o don't have cornstarch van I use the avrlyic powder if I file it well???
I love how u do this!! it's genius! o don't have cornstarch van I use the avrlyic powder if I file it well???
has it even damaged your nail at all?
Can we wash dishes with this nail or taking shower
Is there a substitute for the cornstarch?
I've been wearing acrylics since 11 I'm 18 now.... my nails are strong and have never looked as bad as this... also u using this is pathetic they only last a few days where as acrylics last 1-2 months (depending on length)
But then what if your nail bed is naturally waved and uneven it gon look funky either way
Omg I KNOW IM LATE BUT! HOW Do u take them off?
Where did you get the fake acrylic nail thingies?!!!?!!!!?!!!?!!!?!!!?!!!?!!!!!!?!!!!!!!?
can u use flour
Agree chunky acrylic is so ugly !!! Love your video
How can u remove it?
What if you can't/don't have cornstarch
this video is amazing! im for sure trying this asap! so nail polish removes the tip? what if i wanted to change the color?
WHY DOES EVERYONE SAY DIY NAILS WHEN U HAVE TO GO TO WALMART OR SOMETHING AND BUY THE EXTENSIONS!!! GIRLLLLL I DONT HAVE A WALMART I LIVE IN IRELAND😫😫
Which nail glue did you use
My nails never look like that after acrylics
this is so awesome thx
Can i mix cornstarch with base coat?
His has helped me soooo much thank you!!
I am going to try this out!!
What color nail polish your using?
how long do they usually last ??
This is so wrong omg...the way you apply the tips, the way you fade them...and all the misinformation about acrylic application and removal oh God, girl you went to a cheap salon and they destroyed your nails thats sad but not all acrylic applications are like that, stop spreading ignorance
Yes omg this saved my life kinda because my mom never lets me get acrylic so I'm honing to ask her if she can do these on me and she will probably do them on me!!! Also you should do a take off of these nails
I'm doing this now as I watch 😩 at the corn starch stage waiting for it to dry... the filing is gonna take the longest but it'll be worth it 😻😻😻
What kind of glue was used?
Amazing
i have natural style nail TIPS but i want to wear them to school, any ideas to make them look real like clear acrylics? thanks xox
this really just saved my life. and it looks so easy. definitely trying today for prom
Great video. Thanks
Could I put that mixture on my whole real nail to make the layers even or does it not work that way?
This changed my life omg
Amazing result :) I also made a Nail Acrylic DIY. You can check it out if you want :)
I find your videos very helpful and easy to watch! thank you!
Ok I have been searching through the comments... has anyone actually tried this? If so how long did it last, and did you goof on the cornstarch to polish ratio. Just wondering before I actually try it. I have done my own acrylics before and totally botched it. The looked chunky and not natural at all.
Can you list all the equipments and nail brands and polishes you used in this video? This is such a healthier way! Who would of thought lol. Love it!!!
What color is this nail polish
only corn starch works
Did anyone try this ?
If you decide you want to take them off will they just come off like normal with nail polish remover?
*OMG* AT LAST ANOTHER GIRL WHO HATES THE CHUNKY NAIL TREND!
that nail place should never do that idk where you went but that's not how it should be done.
I honestly dont understand why people dont just grow their nails out, like it would make your life so much easier then doing all the steps to put the fake nails on
Can I use baby powder or flour?
This is great, however the electric file isn't what's damaging, it's the nail tech. I'm a diy nail person too and if you would like to use an e-file to do this, it's still good. Great Job
Sorry but I don't think they look so great, they look bumpy. I like acrylic better.
will flour work? Can you use full false nails?
This is not doing acrylic nails if you're using tips, acrylic nails is using the powder to make and build the nails. Samething goes if your doing it with the gel and using the tips just like you did, it depends on who you go to. Plus; you did things wrong and giving out wrong information which it leaves me to question alot. The nails don't look that natural and any nail would look natural if you do it right, if they only last about a week- then they aren't the effort to do.
What is the name of the nails you have? They look small which is good I have small hands.
trying today...
Holy cow this is WAY easier!
THIS IS AWESOME! I'm definitely gonna use this
OMG this is brilliant! thank you!
but they dont even last long only for a week or 9 day or so
I love this your voice is so soothing
I am IN LOVE w this technique! I do my own nails since I was about 15yo as well and ALWAYS hated the chunky look too... 🙄 I loved loved! Thank you for sharing! I'll be trying that in a few minutes! Hahahaha
super cool
For what nails me!
i've been doing this technique, ever since i watched this. works so good and last for awhileee.
Also - Would I get the same affect/better affect if I were to mix the corn starch in with acrylic liquid rather than clear polish ?
Do they break off easily ? And do you think by applying a greater amount of corn starch solution they would last longer ?? Thank you 💕
omg!! this is awesome!! I never would have thought to use corn starch!! amazed!! gotta try!
I love ur idea I'm gonna try tonight :)
nails should never be drilled like that it s so horrible!where ever your going stop going there find somewhere else to go
OMG Thank You! The Struggle Is Over! lol YaY
Wow your nails look amazing Great job!
what nail glue did you use?
in the packaging the nail were clear but when you put them on they where white
shut up thats soo easy even clumsy me can do it!! awesome tnx so much for posting😍😍😉
Acrylics are worth the money. They're long lasting and look nicer. You don't have to get them huge and long.
What would be good alternatives for cornstarch?
do you think yoi could use corn meal?
im gonna try this with a paper plate. i hope it works LMAO
Wow that was great I love that idea...and they look AWESOME
The proper way to cut tips is not with scissors
OMG...this is amazing!
With this method how long do they last? About two weeks maybe or longer than that?
this is so cool my friend got actual ones and I am wearing press ons but they pop off so I will try this method tomorrow, question if they are exposed to a lot of water will they come off?
MIND BLOWN!!!! Thank u so much because my mom won't allow me to have acrylics lol
I just purchased tips! I will try this but first I have a question can I use baby powder and clear polish instead of cornstarch and clear polish
how long does it normally last for?
Do you have to use cornstarch can you use flour or baking soda?
How would you take them off? :) Awesome tutorial by the way!
After acrylics my nails do not look like that at all. They are just a bit soft as nails need exposure to the air to harden (like a bandaid on your skin) when they are covered they go soft. Otherwise they are exactly the same
Can the corn starch and clear polish be used to touch up old acrylic from the nail salon?
im sorry dont kill me but your not ment to cut acrylics or falsies with scissors but any why i need to try this
Has anyone tried doing this and putting gel nail polish over it?
Can you get the tips an ebay
can you make acrylic nails with baking soda?
I work in a restaurant but I can't every get my nails done but I will do this at least once since its simple and cheap
Best at-home tutorial I've seen. Thanks!
What kind of Polish and what is the name of it? it is beautiful
She was 13 in 2007 wow oml
Ohh I want nails like that !!!!#💓 💜 💓 💞 💝 💘 💗 💟
That isn't an acrylic diy that's just adding a tip and adding polish
I don't understand why salons use a drill on the natural nail its super harmful and the drill should only be used with the acrylic nail.
I know it's very long ago that you uploaded this video, but does flour instead of corn starch also work?
Is there a substitute for corn starch ?
we have the same name!!  but there's a age difference 😂😘😘😘
how do you manage to do your other hand?
I know this was like a year ago but I just saw this and it has been the most helpful acrylic video ever thank you so much for making this
I fucked this up soo bad
the pictures of the damaged nails  freaked out😬😆
You so smart!!!!My mom never wanted me to get acrylic but this looks perfect
i tried it yesteray it works really good thank you!!!
This is the most amazing video on the internet, i have never been so happy! Im so sick of gluing on fake nails and them lasting 3 days! I want acrylics but cant do them on my own, I’m blown away at this method!! SO excited to try it! Thankyou Alexandra!!!!! XOXO
thank you so much for sharing. did you mix clear nail polish with the corn starch?  or do you mean glue gel? i was confused abt that..
Do you have to use cornstarch or can I use flour?
this did not work at all with tips that have wells so don't buy those ones
I Work In A Warehouse as machine operator I'm Tryna figure out will my nails break as soon as I touch something ?
Does this work for really really short nails? Like..for people who chew their nails?
Do do you have to use cornstarch, or is there a substitute?
When I go get my nails done my nails always get very sore when they are done with my nails and I hate it
Loveeeeeee ittt omg thank you.
Great video and great idea! I will be trying it as soon as these ugly salon acrylic nails grow out. Had to go to the "pros" because I damaged my nails at home so I thought going to them would give my nails a break from what I was doing to them. I wish I'd come here first. But I have saved your video, and will be following the steps. Thank you!
what nail glue did you use??
can you please please do a vid on how to get the       stilleto         shape? thanks and illy
that is a amazing way to do it..
Ayeee thanks for this vid! I had a interview at a high school i want to go to and my nails were ugly so thanksss ❤️

What glue did she use?
what glue did she use?
omg thanks so much help
Is there any other powder that I can use that isn't cornstarch? :)
Finally once I am out of my powder and liquid, I am going to try your idea! I have worn acrylics for about 35+ years and the shops took my nails nd did major damage to them! That is why my husband surprised me with all I need to do at home like I used too! Thank you for the tip! This rocks!
How long did it take you guys to do them
What kind of nail glue do you use?
ok we all know there r some downfalls to having acrylic nails but she was showing some really bad pictures of things that dont commonly happen
lol my nails naturally look like acrylic when grown lol
How do you remove them? I've never used these and I'm always wondering how to put them on and remove them
does the glue come with the 100pc nail set?
I LOVE LOVE LOVE. your method. Amazing! I love doing my nails at home because i hate how manicurists damage your natural nails. I am going to try this. 💞
Can i use powder and clear nail polish I don't have baking powder or starch
did u use regualr nail glue like the kind u can get from the dollar store or walmart?
could you paint, cut, and shape those nails before putting them on
Can you use flour instead of cornstarch? Please answer☺️
This is amazing and so, so creative!! LOVE your channel!
How do u take them off and can u play sports with the NBC I play softball and i dont know how to like now brake them
I do acrylic myself and I never fill my nails down only because you honestly don't have to. As long as you buff the nail and make sure it is clean NO OIL they can last for a while.
How would you recommend taking them off?x
THANK YOU for this video!! I tried it and so far they've lasted a week and still going strong! I'm a barista and they've stayed on through constant wet hands and cleaning. I'm gonna save so much money because here in Australia we pay at least $60 for acrylic nails!  Xxxxx
Also works with a gel polish method!!
What's the name of the white thing she sticks on her finger? Sorry for my english, im belgian
You can obviously see the bump....😂 Smh nah
how do u remove the nails??!?!?!
Oh, my gosh! I may just have to try this. I do NOT want to have to deal with nail wraps or acrylic at all. This is super neat. Thanks! :)
What kind of glue do you like best?
please show me how to get the french nail, white tip look! I LOVE this,,,I am so glad I found it!
What did u use to glue those fake nails down? Thanks :)
where can i buy an affordable and good glue for this?
SOOOOO glad I found this because I absolutely hate getting acrylic nails and I love DIYs!
Dobyou have arthritis in the beginning your finger kinda curved inwards
Frickin luv this!!! I know what you mean about the drill. So many times it gets angled wrong and my actual finger would get cuts and look horrible. Thank you sooo much, instant fan!!!
can baking soda be used instead  of cornstarch?
someone please tell me where you can get that pinkish nail polish!!! I love the color! what store???!
your so pretty i love ur video and they look so pretty
Am I missing something here? Isn't it easier just to get one of those full cover nail kits instead of tips?  They even come with glue and already painted.
this is good idea !
Can you just use regular scissors for cutting then nails? Also could you use nail clippers?
so how would you take them off, soak them?
I'm a nail tech and there is so much wrong with this video I don't know where to start. I will say this, if your nails look like what was shown in the video after acrylics were removed, you need to change nail techs.
And I spent like £40 a week having them done well now I can save money 😂😂
You said you would answer all the questions in the comment section but u didn't
My nails came off 2 days later and my tech drilled my nail bed 3 times I let her finish and Im never going back  and I'm kinda scared to get a new set.
i've trying it so many times. and i love the result
they don't break as easilly
Can I use baking powder instead?
I love you  more  Alexandra every time I see your videos
That video will "change your life" sorry Alexandria but being bisexual has already changed my life ❤😂💖
Do they fall off often/easily?
did your nails grow?
If you want fake nails that aren't thick you should try getting wraps, they don't last very long but if you want them for a special event like a party or something. You just have to be careful because them being thinner means they aren't as sturdy.
Can you use flour
i will not even try to explain you why this is stupid for you and for the rest of the ppl. The acrylic can look natural this is my job so i know, second the photos of the damage nails are cause they removed them with the wrong way (file it and soak it in aceton after 20 minutes it will be fine) glue is much more toxic than acryl or gel. + that if you made  a mistake with the tip and the application can cause use huge problem, you can even loose your nail. so please check the  everythig before you upload something
So pretty like😍😍😍
I've seen others do this already :/
what is this glue and the white thing you applied on the nail for length ??
where do you buy the tips
couple questions and comment ..My questions are : would using super glue or a stronger glue make them last longer ? How do they hold up , do they pop off with any type of wrong move or are they more like the real acrylics that didn't come off till you were ready to take them off?  My experience with acrylics is good and bad .. i used to get them done every 2 weeks for like 10 yrs . The pro was that it was they never would just pop off like the DIY ones, they were almost impossible for them to come off until you took them off , so you didn't have to always worry about them popping off and so you can just do everything normally without having to worry . My con was the money, it always took like 45 mins for them to do it , my nails would be so sore for a couple days after , and of course the damage to your nails..
Woww😻😻😻 the best diy ever
I got my nails done (acrylic) and one came off, Is superglue a safe way to stick it back on?
if i apply cornstarch on my nail before acryilic, my nails would be healthy after remove everything?
where did she gee her clear nail tips?
It took me hours just to do one hand! :( I'm not even done painting yet... Idk where to get a good file?
Is there anything I can use except clear tips and what kind of glue do I use??
Please do a stiletto there are others but I know you would go way more in depth and I really want to do a stiletto I've always wanted acrylic but my mom won't let me because they are damaging and I wear fake nails not tips but the ones that go to you cuticle so please do a stiletto dropped a like
It's bad to put your "acrylic" on the nails stress point 🙄
today I got the same fake nails that she showed in the video so it can be the same
THAT'S CRAZY! I'm going to try this this week! I broke two nails and this would be perfect! who would have thought cornstarch and clear polish? I have two questions... medium or coarse file and any type of clear polish(say....cheap)? I'm literally blown away!
where didnu get the nail extentions
Can you use corn flour
why did she use corn starch and clear polish
Oh my god this helped me sooooo much
How do you change the nail polish without taking nail polish remover and removing the fake tip?
what brand of nail tips do you recommend? I cant find the brand you are using. :/
Can you use UV gel polish on top? Would it not stick well to the cornstarch & clear filler? Has anyone tried it with UV gel polish? Does it only last a week because of the starch or because of the polish? Please answer!
awesome tutorial thanks  for the safe trick of wearing nails
I looooveee uuu omg saved my life and money !!!!!!
new subbie. you're amazing!
great ! can't wait to try this out !
I love this!!!
hey! I'm thinking about trying these. what glue do you want to buy?
lástima que no te entienda el vídeo me a gustado me parece que a sin no me darían alerjia
i wanted to try this but the cornstarch we have expired in 2011 so I think that's why it wouldn't work for me.
Girl you've done changed the game !
does it work with flour
I love your videos but I used to be a nail tech and I am wondering when you mean a week do you mean All of the nails come out or just one nail.
What is the nail polish color name?
Omg her voice lol
And there is a bunch of tutorials of this and NOT because of you!
You did not make this method up.
awesome!!!!
í tried this but didnt work out ..
I am doing this at my aunts house
Can you use the formula as regular acrylic too? Or just as a barrier?
where can you get the gold finger nail tips? (except online cuz im not aloud to shop online) btw i love your videos
I just tried this and it looks amazing <3 thank you so much for all the tips
What can I use as a substitute for the corn starch
Can I use flour 😂
If one pops off and you're out can you like glue it back on or does it look too messed up to fix it really quick lol
thank you sooo much for this!!! truth about everything, I don't like the bulky nails and definitely don't want to be spending that much money every couple weeks. #genius.
Awesome!!!!!
Thank you! I am allergic to acrylic and gel so this is perfect, I repaired a broken nail using this technique and it looks fab😊
My name is Alexandra
Love it thxxxx
wow this is like science 😀 thank you for sharing!
Perfect!
the nails look beautiful!! would you be able to do a stiletto nail tutorial?
what kind of nail polish did u use gel or regular
So good thank you xxx
AlexandrasGirlyTalk can I use baking powder or flour instead??
I'm still gonna do Acrylics 😂
I try this... I love it... thanks... my work won't allow me having acrylic nails... so it's easy for me to do it on the weekend and than take them off for work...
this is kierramoorlet i love this video thx
I did this and it worked! Love love this hack
I like getting acrylics because they last longer and for the people who aren't the best at doing nails shouldn't have to do them themselves because it would end up looking bad. Acrylics on the other hand I would prefer because it has a better turnout. I do understand that acrylics do damage to your natural nail but where I get my nails done at, it does 0% worth of damage.
Thank you! I have natural long nails, and yesterday while working on my car one of my nails broke 😢  I'm going to do this on the nail until it grows out 😁 this is much healthier and safer for your nails 🤗
Where can you buy the clear mail set?
this is just dumb hahah they didn't look nice at all they where also clumpy looking!!! wow what a waste of time watching this crap
I didn't know I had been waiting for this video my whole life, I also hate the chunky look of fake nails and you're a life saver. Thanks sooo much for this video
You're so amazing! I became allergic to acrylics a year ago and my nails always break now :( I'll definitely try this! 😘❤
Is the corn starch step necessary?
Weird comment but I love your voice!
I absolutely love this idea! Going to try this weekend💞
I'd love to see a stiletto nail tutorial!!! I can't wait to try these ones!
can you do a stiletto tutorial
you should patent this method...this is awesome...do you have an alternative to pink acrylic powder?
Where did you purchase the nails?
Mad exaggeration on acrylic nails. When they are done badly, they are chunky and make your nail beds look horrible. If you are dealing with a professional they will look the same when you soak the acrylic off.
You are awesome!!! I've been looking for a way to get the "look" at home and this is purrrrrrrfecttttttt!
I love acrylic
What's the best acrylic glue?
this is awesome . love the look . will certainly try this. Thanks for sharing!
I don't have instagram but I did do it and it worked
I cannot wait to try this!!!!!  I really hope it works for me!!!!! Btw I love that color you used!!!! Great video 👏🏽👍🏼
Awsome so gonna try this!!
can someone watch my vids
Can I use flour instead of corn starch?
could you use baking soda instead of cornstarch?
The drill does hurt a tinsy bit but it didn't hurt that much and when I took them off they were fine I just put a top coat over them and they were fine
stfu i love u mind blown!!!
wow have been doing this since jr high..awsome and i love it..safe
I love this video so much I always find my self back at it.
has anyone tried this ? how was it ??
Hi, can you post a video on how to remove this nail
can i use flour i dont own corn starch..
can i use baby power ? or baking soda? doesnt baby powder have cornstarch? :O
I tried this and I can still see the ridge from the acrylic and natural nail. wtf
Thank you. I just got back from the 4th salon I've tried in my new city. Every nail person does a half-assed job and my nails come out looking chunky and crooked every time. Today, the nail artist made me bleed. I still had to pay full price. SO, this DIY is going to happen when these nails are needing replacement. Thank you for posting this.
haw much dus it cost
Acrylics never hurt me
is there an alternative to cornstarch?
what was the clear stuff you mixed with the corn starch? you didn't really say in the video! this is super clever
When i got acrylic nails it hurt and messed up my nails so bad
has anybody tried if so how did it go
Where do I buy the white acrylic tips? She only shows the clear ones 😞
How do they stay on if your active
are there any specific nail tip brands you'd recommend? ilysm btw😘
do you use regular glue or a special nail glue
alexandragirly talk where did you get the nials
FINALLY! SOMEONE WHO THINKS THE CHUNKY NAILS ARE UGLY
Yay!! I like the acrylic look however I too hate that thick nail goopy look. Thank you for this video.
I'm not a nail tech, I've never had a day of instruction, I have, however, had my nails done for the last <mumble>LOTTA<mumble> years.  I'm sick of paying the cost and I'm determined to learn to do this on my own.  I also want to use the acrylics as a base with gel on top.  How hard/easy is it going to be for me to learn to do my own nails at home? (I have no desire to do anyone else's nails, just mine).  I tried once, many moons ago and had no clue about the liquid to powder ratio so you can imagine what an utter failure that was.  Plus, there was no youtube then LOL  I really want to gather the supplies and get going. I have a spin speed dremel and a fine diamond bit.  I'm hoping to get lots of encouragement.  Soooo... Good idea? Bad? Thoughts? Opinions?  Please, no one be mean spirited, as those internet trolls can be, I am truly trying to find a way to cut the cost and yet have my nails the way I want them.  Doing them when I want to is a real plus too.  I'm hoping you'll encourage me to take this plunge!!  Love your videos, you make it all look so easy peasy! ♥
They look amazing !!
please tell me what products you use....
What can I use instead of cornstarch?
mine just turned gooey and not drying
Can anyone please tell me the nail polish she used ? I love the color!

It is amazing vid thank u for these ur helped me coz I strayed wearing acrylic and they are bad I will try it cAn u plz do a his to take of the nails in one other vid thx u so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
can you use baking soda
When getting my nails done the only problem is it hurts when there filling it with my natural nail underneath, feels like it's pulling my nail of! X
I'm trying this as of right now! I'm excited. I've only had acrylics twice in my life and the first time was a salon that used very harsh products. The nails were so hard to get off and my pinky nail broke straight in half and took off the whole top part of my nail. 😢 so I'm excited to try this.
Yeah, how to remove??
I loved this tutorial and definitely want to try this but do you know if you can get those nails in the UK?
When I went to the Solon that is what they did
what can I use if I don't have corstarc?
how do you take them off?
can u put this over your natural nail without using the fake ones and where do you get citicle oil from
can i use cheap clear nail polish for this or does it have to be a top brand clear nail polish
thank you that really works batter for my nails than when I go and buy acrylic nails.💯👍
for how many days does this stay?
did she say cornstarch?
This has nothing to do with acrylic nails, but it has to do with fake nails. Is it true that fake nails can ruin/damage your nails?
What brand is the white tips from
would this be more beneficial than just putting on fake nails?
How come it looks so easy when you do it! My dumb ass messed all up!
I always try this method and it works so well. thanks for sharing such useful videos ❤❤
I like your nails and what app do you use to edit your video??
I dont know if you approved this so I thought Id let you know https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1221707837841286&id=155515554460525
Can't wait to try this !!! Thanks soooo much. Definitely gonna save me some money.
where did she get the glue?
Loved this video! i would love to tey because i hate when they use the drill. Where can I buy the tips and glue?
I dont get it. She says to use clear nails the  she uses white nail extensions?
i have applied some aclyric before but I am gonna be honest I do sometimes think it's too thick so I will follow your advice you are my inspiration I love you
you're a smart young lady. I love your idea. I'm definitely going to try this. what is the name of the color polish you're using in the video. it's gorgeous. I'm definitely subscribing. Thank you so much.
At my nail salon fillers for your acrylics are 5 dollars
I do acrylics at home, they always look great, they always bring me complements, in fact I'm doing them right now. They never damage my nails.
These look amazing❤️
How do you remove these nails??
What you put with cornstarch?
I really prefer natural looking nails, so I'll definitely try this out. Thanks!
I meant clear tips
Y do u prefer the glass nails better🤔
Nice video👌
Hi the nails looks different, are they white nail or clear
I'm gonna try to make my mom let m try this because this is awesome!
What else can you use for clear nail polish?
Thank you a million times. If i known this i wouldnt of hurt my nails
Your so right
where would i buy the acrylic nails?  and what was use to mix with the corn starch?
I pretty much never comment on videos BUT I LOVE THIS CANT WAIT TO TRY IT OUT :D
when i first got acrylics i really liked them but it hurts when they buff my nails. they always make me bleed
👍❤
Which glue??
instead of cuticle oil, can I use baby oil?? or no? 😓
Been using this method on my days off (4days)  but I find it hard to stay on, on the 3rd day.... Is it because I'm not putting enough cornstarch where the nail meets the fake nail tip?
please change the background. it is really hard  to watch when all the colors match like it was with the fake nails and the white table
Wow that is so clever! I've had acrylics on and they damaged my nails very badly so this is perfect for me! but I do have a question... When you take off the nails... isn't it gonna be hard because of the glue?? Or is the glue gonna damage my nail?? :/
what does DIY mean in begining of vedios ?
This was just what I've been looking for!  Thanks so much. 😊💅
Awesome!
I recently moved and left my acrylic powder and this saved my life!! Also would baking powder work as a substitute?
There most absolutely IS risk of infection.
which nail glow you have used? and what is the name or brand of artifical nails that you used not this video?
Where do I but the nails?
Hey where do u get the extentions
Where do you get your nails
ugly nails
I'd be the idiot to mess this up lol
what nail color is this omg it's amazing pls someone
love it,what glue would you use?the glue that comes in the packages never works for long and falls off?
OMG that's so true. I thought I was the only one who was in pain. I got my nails done professionally for my cousin's wedding several years ago. Those ppl filed, and buffed my nails down so much, it was hurting my fingers the next day. Some ppl said that's natural pain but I was like wtf. When the lady was buffing my nails down, my nail bed was getting too hot. Argh.   That was the first and last time I ever got my nails done professionally. Although they look really nice on ppl, all that buffing is not good for ur nails. I rather grow my nails naturally.
how do you take them off?
LITERALLY SAVED MY LIFE LOVE THIS
they***
just tried this method and I love it. it was So easy
Does it hurt when you take it off and how do you take it off?
Does anybody else think she sounds like Andrea from andreaschoice
YouTube unsubscribed me!!
1) Nails shouldn't look like that after acrylic removal, a lot of people in the nail industry just do it because it's easy money, so they're not passionate about what they do, which results in shitty acrylic nails, shitty natural nails, and a shitty nails tech.  2) Don't act like you know more than nail techs, you don't. (Unless they mess up your nails, then you probably know more)  3) The drill file should NEVER touch a natural nail. The drill is for smoothing out the acrylic and giving it shape, which brings me back to point 1, if your nail tech uses the drill on your natural nail, they're a shitty nail tech.  4) If when your polish is dry and you can see bumps or curves in the reflection of the light, you've got a shitty nail tech on yours hands. They didn't shape your acrylic correctly.  5) acrylics should look like they're growing out of your nail bed, if they look chunky like the pictures in this video, that's a shitty nail tech.  My point is, it depends on the artist. It's like painting, if you get an art student who's not passionate about their work to paint a portrait, they're going to do a terrible job because they're just in it for the money. (This is a terrible comparison because most art students take the risk of being poor after college, and money isn't guaranteed, but it's the best I could come up with)
which glue are you using?
where do you buy the tips??
This is also NOT diy
What glue does she use for the adhesive of the nail?
can i just ask how you'd take these off? i'd love to try them for myself but if i don't like them it would be nice to know how to take them off easily
Stiletto tutorial :) I adore your videos...
Can we use flour instead of cornstarch?
I tried this at home and my nails looked grainy..how can I avoid this??? My nails also popped of so easily! Is there a different glue or nail brand I need to use?
add link to buy that colour is just awesome
nail polish colour plz....
The first time I got acrylics it cost $35 but now it's even better thank you so much !
I have vertical cracks on a couple of my nails. Is your method beneficial to allow that kind of damage heal? (Seems like it would give the nail time to heal. But I worry about using the superglue . . . )
how easily do they break, I do a similar method with gel polish instead to add extra strength because I'm so rough on my hands and they break easily.
I used to always get my nails done in a salon but stopped for the last year or so.. My question is how can you make them last longer ? Can you re do this method every few days ?
Thank you for sharing
What kind of glue do you use for your press on´s?
How do you take them off
do you have to do clear mail polish or can you use a desired colour
I got acrylics my graduation my nails they work buff that hard and my nails did not hurt the next day but honestly when I put on the acrylic all the time they do not hurt
Isn't it going to break off easily??
Thanks for making this video! I did this an hour ago and the results are incredibly close look alike to acrylics!
When you do the base coat, could it be replaced with maybe an at home gel polish? for a little extra strength?
Does flour or baby powder work? Instead of cornstarch
Can I do this with flour?
I cannot wait to try this omg ❤️😍🤗
Can u use flower instead of cornstarch
so awesome didn't even know some thing like that is possibly
How do you remove them safely?

How do u remove them?
Idk what kind of nail technicians you guys have but y'all need to change them 😂
The only thing that Happens to me when I wear acrylics is my nails just gets weak
Alexandra, I bought the same clear set you showed but they didn't snip easily? Every time I tried to use scissors to cut them, they snapped.
I tried this on my daughter and it was an epic fail
Thank you!!! I stopped wearing acrylics because of a bad experience & I've missed having them at times,this will change that! AMAZING!!!  best idea ever, I can't wait to try this.... You've definitely got yourself a new subscriber😊👌👏💅💭
My friend came over and we did this it came it soo nice everyone try it
TACO🌮
My acrylics were actually really good. I have bitten my nails since I was like 2 so I asked for acrylics for this summer and I took it off the other day. It didn't ruin my nails at all, but the person who took it off put shellac at my nails because I had long nails under the acrylics. Now I've almost gotten rid of the habit. ☺️
What can I use instead of cornstarch?
Please help!!! I have cornflour, is that the same as corn starch????
I just got finished doing my nails, trying this method. They look so purdy! I highly recommend this method for an alternative to acrylics
I looooveeee acrylic nails. They are so pretty. I'm trying to grow out my nails and they help me grow them out without biting them. I love it.
post a video of you removing these DIY acrylic nails
how long do you have to wait for the corn starch to dry? and are you using gel nail polish or normal?
What is that withe powder she used?
what glue did u use?
were exacly do you buy your acrylic powder and ebay is ok but i feel like there is a better way to get acrylic nails and powder
this diy is awful, pls go to a professional studio!
Can u do my nails !? Lmao😂💘
gonna try this. thanks alex!
I have tryed this 4 times and every time I try to cut them or file them they eather snap off or split down the middle.  where am I going wrong
the only problem is i  have piano lessons every week... whateva ima do this anyways lol
Fabulous❤️💃🏻
OMG!!! I soooooo have to try this method!!!
how do u remove them? x
where do you get clear tips
Nice Technique and easy. It would be a good option for me if I do a lot of modeling again and I can't have long nails all the time So it's easy to remove but I prefer acrylic because I'm pretty rough with my nails and I think they last on me for 2 days lol. I had acrylic nails for a year and my nails where slightly damaged and thin but still looked fine. Not peeled like the picture you showed. With Acrylic nails I don't have to worry and I can do a lot of things. 💅🏽🙊 but great video I'll keep the technique in mind.
can i use fake nails instead of fake tips ?
I am with you, I love a thin natural nail. I have my own but occasionally we break one so thanks for making me confidant to do this again xoxoxo
when you get acrylic nails, tell them to lightly buff the nails bc u have sensitive nails. and they will and it won't be painful. They can also hand buff the natural nail, but use the drill on the acrylic part. Just ask them to do it how u want it done.
Does it matter what color tips you get?
You're easily my favorite youtuber. not only are your videos so entertaining and fun to watch, they're absolute lifesavers with all of the tips you give!! love ya girl👸🏼💅🏼
Tips 3€ wish
what kind of glue do you use
ong it worked you are a  guru!!💙💙
Can you do a stilleto nail tutorial please ❤️❤️
the first time I got acrylics they used the drill and cut the sides if my finger and it started gushing blood and they didn't say anything when they obviously say all the blood!
steleto!
I love how she gets right into the videos... No dumb intro or fake bits.... Love love love
my mom is a nail artist and she bothers me wanting to do my nails everywhere like don't you have clients and Rafael's and she has business cards and stuff. like she won't leave my nails alone!
A tech should NEVER, EVER leave your nail that damaged. They shouldn't use the drill on your nail beds. A normal file can take the shine off.
Is there something else that you can use if you don't have cornstarch at home
a good nail tech shouldn't be filing your natural nail with an electric drill
How long do the nails last for
your nails are so pretty I'm going to try it
how much do acrylics cost
I don't get this at all.
Totally gonna use this
is there any way I can do this without cornstarch
Did someone try this already?! 🙈
great idea but anyone who loves nails can clearly see how uneven and bumpy they still look underneath that polish... paying the money is worth the precision & cleanliness, as well as how long they last. a true professional doesnt leave your nails looking that messed up if acrylics are removed..
Definitely waiting on the Stilletto version of this hack! Love your videos & congrats on the baby bump 😊❤
What's that she put on her natural nail in the beginning?
Did you say cornstarch and clear nail polish??
Good
hey Alexandra can you make acrylics out of corstarch and clear polish
how long would it last?
What kind of glue did you use, and where can you find or buy the fake nail part ?
How long does the nail to grow? Pliz answer
i'm sorry but i don't really know what material u used for fake nails ? thnx 😘
I tried it, but unfortunately did not look good. Also was hard and painful to removed them.
where can you buy the nail tips u used in the vid
thx u so much now I dont have to spend ma money
Can you please make a video on how to remove them?
Does one have to use clear polish and cornstarch? Can one use top coat and cornstarch instead? PLEASE ANSWER
can you use baby powder
you have no idea how much I appreciate you for this!
can you do a stiletto nail video
I love your video so much it is so helpful but I want to try acrylic nail but the way you describe it it makes it sound sooo horrible and painful is it really like that
Acrylics don't ruin your nails at all if you apply them and remove them correctly. And they actually last. I don't believe for a second these last long when they're only being held by nail polish which doesn't last on its own even for anyone who uses there hands. This technique may work better with gel, but acrylics are the way to go if you want something that will last more than a week and a half.
where do you get the clear tips?
My FAVE nail tutorial thanksxxx
Sooo helpful, thankyou!! 😊
these look horrible.. u can see where the tip is when the polish is on and the polish is so messy
these look horrible.. u can see where the tip is when the polish is on and the polish is so messy
I love the faux acrylic with corn starch and polish.instead of doing the  edge of the tip and nail I do the whole nail so it looks like real acrylic.And it actually lasts like acrylic but half the price.☺️thanks for this tutorial!
What does she use to do the mixture? I don't understand it very well bc I'm not English. Would be nice of anyone to just write it down then I can google it shame on me haha.
What else can you use if you don't have corn starch?
where did you get the length nails from?
so creative
Where should I get that white things(fake nails) from ? And what did she used to stick that? (sorry I have never used something like that, so I have no ideea.. )
I did it and I like the results a lot
does anyone know a substitute for cornstarch
Where did you buy the tips from?
i love this .
genius
What can I use instead of cornstarch?
"Acrylic nails without acrylic"   Then it aint acrylic darling. Lemme tell you, that story you said about your first acrylic nail job, that is a very very very bad nail store. Tell your story to a proffesional and they'll show you how a real acrylic job is. And if you dont like the "big nail" look, that's also a sign of a very bad nail store. Good stores will try their best to make your nails look good and not like shit. And hey, it's fake nails, they're supposed to look fake. I gotta say tho that the corn starch(spelling?) trick was very smart.
im thinking of trying this, how strong are they compared to salon acrylics? i tap my fingers a lot on things!
I loved this..TFS
I know I'm so late; but where did you get the fake nails?
TBH, I wanna get acrylics, but my mom says they are damaging and she is a nail technician, but she believes this is more safe, so imma try this one.
Does this stay on really well? Like for school?
So...the name of the video is."Acrylic Nails DIY Hack". Maybe it should just be called "Polish Your Nails DIY"? Just a suggestion...
im very confused as to what corn starch is, im from the uk. is it cornflour? cornmeal? or can i use some kind of replacement like i wanna do this so bad lol
can u use flour
Can u use flour
I really enjoy fake nails but I HATE the sound of the file scratching on my nails! It makes my head wanna blow off cause it makes my teeth hurt so bad
For the clear nail polish can I use a top coat or base coat ?
omg thank you so much!
Did she use nail glue?
Can these work on anybodys nails? some of my nail are a bit wider and I don't want to buy these if they don't work on mines??? someone plz help me...
You have the right to refuse a nail drill
okay so is the cornstarch blend and the filing what makes it not as chunky as regular acrylics?
SHE IS PREGNET
where could you buy those nails ?
What glue is she using
Unprofessional
how long do they last
This helps so much omg  I've never heard of this method before
do they break off easily just asking for work purpose
what are all the materials used for this DIY
i love getting my nails done but i want to try this too ....
she sounds just like andreas choice
U are so talented! Definitely trying this out ❤️
where can you find the nail extensions
What nail polish dos you use? I've been looking for that colour forever
So for example if my regular size of my nail is 8 I should put a 7 right ?
I've been sitting here for two hours waiting for this cornstarch to dry it still hasn't dried what's going on?
How do u remove them and what glue did u use?
My hair is EXTREMELY greasy, I have to wash them every 3 days. Do you think using my nails with these acrylics will last me? Besides I keep my nails much shorter and square.
Can I use baking soda instead of cornstarch ?
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME ALL THE THINGS I NEED TO DO THIS?😞
can someone please tell me where do i get the glue ?😞
Sorry but what's acrylic nails?
Very nice idea
You can't cut tips with scissors!

Do you have to use  cornstarch
Is there a way to make them last longer than a week??

Does it have to be nail glue?
THIS IS SO COOL
I LOOOVE YOU FOR THISS!!!! I always kept my nails done but now with my nursing acrylic is a big NO NO! Omg thank you so much for this tutorial! I can be girly again!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
When i got my acrylics done they used a file instead of a drill
Actually acrylic are stronger but the after affects aren't really good but acrylic lasts longer
I did this and my nails are gorgeous!!! Thank you so much!! 😘
I dont even get acryllic nails and i've watched like 20 different videos...explain the points of these!
ur reall nails looks more beautiful than fake
how long do these last you normally?
THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!  I got my nails done for the first time for my prom. The end result was beautiful but when it came to removal, it was horrible. after 2 months my nails are only now beginning to repair even while using a Sally Hansen nail repair kit and nail hardener (which usually work very, very well for me). My nails were just as jacked up as the pictures you displayed and I am so happy you posted this. thankyouthankyouthankyou lol
U r an awesome person i tried this and it look liked they were real and looked perfectly good after they came off
Thank you, I actually used it on my natural nails,then add nail lacquer and and extra tough top coat....love it,going on week 2
Can we use cornflour instead?? Please answer!
lol I've been doing that since I was 12 too
Wao cool ..how long they last u .and do they split when y do things,
OMG! This is amazing!!! So glad I came across this video. I agree! I don't get my nails done bc they damage the nail. I've been doing press on's. but this made me happy. Thank you!
your nail beds are PERFECT!!
this can cause way more damage to you natural nails also acrylic or gel does not damage your nails its the technician applying the enhancements if there over filing or using the dril instead of a regular hand file on the natural nail
This is amazing but they don't last long . And when I get them salon done they last. This is perfect bc they are not damaging your nails but where I do my nails they hardly get Damaged .
getting my nails done never hurt me in any way
So I tried this and loved it but there's still a distinct difference where the fake nail is and the real nail is. Is there a way of fixing this or making it easier? I filed the heck out of them but it's just not a smooth transition 😥
(2:30) that's what improper nail removal looks like from a nail technician who has no idea what they're doing . If you go to someone who actually knows what they're doing and you've seen their work , you'll get good quality lasting work that does not damage your nails. I am a licensed nail technician and getting good work that won't damage you , costs money. That picture was possibly the worst job on a removal I've ever seen .
Hi by the way I love you so much but can I ask you a question from where you find the tips because I live in Qatar and I didn't find any tips we just have like full on  Fake nails I really hope you understand me by   "full on fake nails " .... ily XOXO

I've watched this for like 3 times already . i love this . this is really helpful
Hi, are these waterproof?
pliz sub
Where did you get the nail empress
The cornstarch thing works great but I tried filing the nail part that touches your natural nail first so that it matches it and it works fine but either way is great.
Where do you get the extension part that you put in your nail
what a great idea!!! trying this like tomorrow yas
Omg love this .... I never have enough money to get my nails done Thank You!! 💅🏼🙌🏼😻😍❤️
i love how she mentions her how to paint your nails perfectly video, but then doesn't do the "dot push pull" method. lol
amazing idea
Where has this video been all my life?!!
What  type of glue
i jst looove yo vdos..
Do you know Hudabeauty posted this video on her Facebook page.
..you speak so fast 😳 have mercy on me I'm German 😳🙈 lol 😆☺
totally kool.  gonna try it!!!
where can you buy the nails, i would love to test this out
Love the idea!! How would you take these off??
OMG girl how am I just finding out about this? Life changer! 😍😍😍
what color is that?????
how long they last ?
Every time I apply that corn starch it takes forever to dry. Are there any measurements or exact amounts of corn starch?
how did she cut the nails to fit perfectly
I tried it and it really works!!
Can super glue be used as nail glue or is nail glue a better choice? Also.. Can I remove it with nail polish remover?
how long do they last?
Just doing a full press-on nail would avoid you having to worry about them not coming out perfect, especially if you're trying it for the first time the night before a big event.
that's awesome (:
Ok I just tried this, took me a while. The transition between my nail and the fake nail isn't great. It's a little lumpy. It looks ok in some light but at certain angles you can tell. I am pretty good at doing my nails so I'm not sure what went wrong here. Did I not use enough of the cornstarch mixture? Did I not let it dry enough? Once I started buffing the seam, it all pretty much flaked off except the little bit in the crack. I buffed them as smooth as I could and even did 3 coats of clear polish on my nail bed before painting with my color. I think they'll work for my night out tomorrow but I'd be embarrassed if someone saw them up close.
Wont these break easily?
can u please do a video on how to remove them
I'm all for natural, all that filing kills my nails. And hurts sooo bad! Thanks for this video sooo much!!!!😀👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
you sound so much like andreaschoice the tone and everything you guys would get along very well you have very similar personalities
i use some from the family dollar and they work great! They come 80 for $1
What nail polish is that? It's beautiful!
I got my nails done a few days ago and I got solar, when it's time for a fill could I use this method to fill it myself and will it look the same until the solar grows out? If that makes any sense lol
Do they brake easy? Like if I'm doing dishes cleaning stuff??
what kind of glue is used to put the fake part on?
Can you list me the supplies? please and thank you ((: btw, I love this diy!!
wow i wanna try this. i got acrylic w/tips and they looked beautiful but my nails got wrekt i had to wait for the entire nail to grow out the drilled parts.. this'll be perfect for those times i break one nail and have to match the rest
what brand of glue do you use for these?
Does it break easily?🤔🤔🤔
She used the ugliest "after acrylics" pictures.I always get acrylics and my nails never end up looking ugly after. The only reason why they look that ugly after is if you rip off the acrylics so of course it's gonna ruin your natural nails.
Anyone know what nail polish color and brand she's using here?
Can you do the stiletto ones
Hey Alexandra can you use something else rather than using the starch?And if yes can you tell me some other starch replacements.
I DID IT!!!!!! It looks like it's my nail
I have acrylics right now and I'm 11. Not to be like all ratchet but bc I bite my nails and I'm trying to stop. That nail buffer HURTS and I don't say anything cause it like really awkward
i tried this last night and it was a #FAIL
im a nail tech and never have i had a clients nails look like that after removal, and my advice to the people that are expereancing this, is change your tech! nails should be excactly the way they were before acrylics, maybe a bit soft for the first day but there should be no damage at all!
What glue do you use
how do this nail take off
Andreaschoice is her twin sis
i found you on IG. your tips are amazing!!! 😍 following you now.
Could you list everything you used and where you got it 😭
This is so perfect! Thank you!
What glue do you use?
Yes please make s stilletto tutorial!😊
What's the nail polish color? 😍
love this,  before I was doing my own acrylics, but I'm definitely trying this method because I don't like having fake nails on longer than a week.
Please do a tutorial on how to do stilettos or coffin shaped plsss 🙏🏼💗😊
I don't understand what she used to extend the nail? What are those tips and where do you get them from?
😍😍😍😍Nail polish color?????
Where did you get your file from? I want it! <3
Where can you buy the nail tips?
is that baby powder cornstarch
SO GLAD I FOUND THIS!
Does anyone know what colour nail polish this is?
If you want then to last longer then use pink gel nail glue
When my acrylics come off my natural nails are bendy, flimsy, sensitive n it feels weird X
Omg for once I have all the suppliers at home lol
I've gotten acrylic nails two or three times in my life (for prom) and the last time I vowed to NEVER get acrylic nails again. The dremel left a 'ring of fire' and it caused my nails to break, become brittle and even caused pain from them being so thin. I've done my own professional like manicure and pedicure since.
You're seriously the best 😍😭😭😭 thank God for you beautiful!!
are they water proof?
Love it !
anyone know how much time to leave the cornstarch  on the nails? before buffing
can someone tell me how long do you leave the cornstarch on before  buffing  the nail?
Thx so much u saved me tons of $$
my mom has plain fake nails and she's almost out of them. so me and her buy those tips right now
What can I use instead of cornstarch?
I bite my nails so they're pretty short. Does this still work with really short nails?
can you use corn flour instead of corn starch 😊
Can you use gel polish?
I love this so much I'm gonna try to get them u helped me so much cause I'm 10 and want them but they ruined ur nails so my parents said no N this helps me get my nails longer tysm
How did you come up with it?
Cool
Love this idea, will try it.
well that certainly the shortest intro ive heard till date... tysm for dat..!!
My acrylic experience was very good i always go there and it doesn't hurt
what age do you think this is appropriate for? My cousin is 12 and she wants me to do this for her! 👑
i never ever ask for tips, i always ask for nail forms and sculptured nails because my nails are much cleaner and undamaged afterwards when they are removed, also the same woman does my nails and she only uses a hand file :)
I never got my nails done at a nail salon  because I seen how it makes the nails look really bad when you take them off and I feel like I shouldn't be over paying to get my nails done lol when I know I can do it . this video really helped a lot i will be trying this , I love how natural the nails look. thank you for this video , it will be helping most of us❤
If i used this... what would the consequences be?
awsum
Going to be trying this! Thank you
what kind of glue was that? what brands are the best? :) this is an amazing tutorial
WHY DIDNT I KNOW THIS BEFORE I SPENT LIKE 30 DOLLARS ON ACRYLIC SUPPLIES
love the vid and tbh I never new the file trick. that is actually so cool. Thanks Love Ya♥♥♥
STILLETTO TUTORIAL ASAP PLEASE :)
When I got acrylics for the first time she was buffing my nails and got to close to the cuticle, so it started to bleed.
is it ok to put the cornstarch on the full nail for the people with thin brittle nails?
how do you shape coffin nails with artificial nail tips on?
you see I don't have any of these products at home😩😭☹️
Does it have to be corn starch or can it be corn flour?
you got me! I love this so much, I watched twice.
if I decide to change my nail polish colour or to renew it,would my nail polish remover destroy it before time?
Can u do a video in how to shape ur nails please !!
my nails are naturally like these nails that you show..and people always think my nails are face but I swear they are real..my nails just grow really fast
so wait...just corn starch and clear nail polish???
LOVE this!
I mentioned brothers YouTube acc
I'm on my brothers and but when I got my nails done the spinning thing didn't hurt me at all
So do you have to buy the little tips or do you just like use something else at home 🤔
this tutorial was really helpful!
where do you get the clear tips from
I did this it works so well I can't  wait to see another nail videos
How do u take them off cause they are glued down
OMG
Absolutely didn't work for me. I can't smooth it down nicely
How long do they last? Briljant idea ! 💋
I always wonder how people get any kind of acrylic or fake nail to stick at all >< the first time I did acrylics they popped off like fake nails after a week ;-; Fake nails last an even shorter time for me
Well, when it was time to replace the set, they would insist on prying it off when you're supposed to use acetone to soak them away.
Omg thank you soooooo much my mom won't let me do acrylic nails so I can do this instead oh an can I just leave the nails with the white tips as a French nail
I think I'll try this if my nails break , as they are long at the moment
I didn't have cornstarch so I used baby powder instead, it still worked fine.
Can you use baking powder too?

hi I like your nails like this.  Long and polished.  thanks.  red next?
What nail polish is this? I've been looking for a color like that
i need to try this!!
they look beautiful, thx for the tutorial!
Who else realized that her index finger is a bit crooked ?
if you rip off your acrylics there will be the flaky stuff on it but just file it off and it turns out like a normal nail
Can u put a link with the nail tips that u used cuz I want to get the same ones
I actually don't have pain with my acrylics. They just add a bit of pressure to my nail
Love this! So going to try this out! Quick question where did you get the glue that you used for the nails?
No hate but when I have my a ricks on they removed my nails for free and made them look perfect and didn't rip one layer but that's just my experience o don't even have strong nails
Any idea where you got your little metal tray/palette ?
I did it and it looks so good
What type of consistency should the nail polish + cornstarch have?
are these less likely to snap or come off than full fake nails (like the kiss full cover nails?)
Can you do a gel nail polish on top of those tips or will the light from the lamp damage them. Also how do you remove them???xoxo
Omg!! I am so trying this!!
the only reason why you have bad experiences is because you're going to the wrong person. & fyi guys, acrylic is NOT bad for your nails
Where do you get the nail tips
how long did they last
your nails are gorgeous
Hello! How to put off these nail??
Can you use matte polish as well?
Wow your so amazing and did I mention pretty too
Very happy I found this before I bought my acrylic kit 😊
I live this video I will be doing this soon I have gotten acrylics and I recommend not to do it . it will damage your nail once you get them taken off . they cost and 30 to 40 bucks but this way is easier and I will be doing this soon !! Thank You !!
Every time I get acrylics it hurts soo soo bad and then when they put the acrylic on it look soo wide and terrible so this help so so so much!! 😀😀😀
This helped a lot! Thank you so much love ❤️❤️ mines came out beautiful 💕
what's the powder??
Awful
0:42? UK equivalent? x
were did you get your clear tips
About how long does this whole process take? Looks like it takes hours
Which glue is the best for this method? I don't want the glue on my nails after i remove the nails 😕 it takes weeks to remove it
I love the color you painted your nails... I started doing acrylic nails since I was in 6th grade...so cool
I love all your videos.. OMG the way you do your nails beautiful can't believe I've been paying when I can do it myself
I love this color.
thank you now I don't have to damage my nails and they still look pretty thank you sooooooooo much.
cornstarch does not protect your nail from the file. instead of relying on something that has no power to protect your nail, one should just learn how to file properly. also, when acrylics are applied, the nail should not be filed with an efile. it should just be buffed. if this was done to you, you had a crappy nail tech.
so beautiful I like it
it is
could you use baby powder instead of cornstarch?
What exact color did you use on your nails? I'm in love with that color and I have been struggling to find it recently.
What do you prep your nails with?
Awesome idea, and luv the colour, can I please have the shade name, very stunning, thank you
are they flimsy or thick? mine always pop right off if theyre really flimsy. and where did you get the nails?
Can you do this without the tips?
You look a bit like Megan Young 😄
I think she sounds like lustrelux but with a slightly deeper tone
going to try this out!!
what about if your hands are in water a lot? Will it chip where your natural nail is?
love this omg really helped thank u
why not just use fake nails instead? why acrylic nails when there is fake nails?
i do alot of stuff with my hands wil they still last for a week?
5:34 FUCK NO
this is really awesome ! I always like how acrylic nails look but i can get them myself. Because i cant have them on for long because  i need pray again, so even if i got them my  money would go to waste. With this method i can get the look i want and they are easy to remove and also cheap hahahh <3 i love it ! Wil definitely try this out, thanks for sharing <3
i would do this but i work a lot and all of them would be gone the next day
i noticed that one finger is slanted but who cares i love this video anyway and i love her vegan videos also
has anyone else tried this ? how long did it last for you?
I had acrylics and they broke off my real nail and my real nail was so long and it hurt so bad. So I do my own nails now
what glue did you use?
What glue do you use
How do you do the other hand? Is it difficult once you have the tips on?
girl, you have saved my life!
I'm going to try this tonight!!!  great video
Can you give a list of everything that you need ?
What nail polish did you use...I like it (:
3:28 when you do that doesn't blending it with file get rid of all cornstarch ?
What can you substitute for cornstarch?
I live in England can I just use paper
That acrylic removal problem happens when you rip the nails instead of soaking them off. I did the test.
WTF 😂😂😂😂🚫🙆
This is AMAZING. I can't wait to try this. I'm a college student so sometimes I can't afford to go to the shop as often. Thanks for sharing
I think you just changed my life
what color is that?
where can i find the supplies (the 100 nail kit and glue)??
Looks amazing!
How strong are they using this method?
awesome tutorial! what nail glue do you use? thanks!
So when we want to take if off we can just use the nail remover right ?
would normal flour work?😥😥😥
can I also use just flour or do I have to use cornstarch?
I love your video and I'm going to try it in a couple days so I will post my picture when I get done doing it
while learning how to use a nail drill, they said if it causes pain, its not being done correctly and whoever is using it should not do it so much that it takes off that much. i personally prefer the traditional file.
Where can I find the tips? Also does the glue come with it?
can i use normal starch?
can i use normal starch?
Wow. I am new to your channel. I must say this is genius !!! So much more natural looking than acrylic nails 💖💕 love them.
OMG I love this tutorial!! It's looks so easy and they look like actual acrylic nails!! I'll be trying this out soon!!
I'm definitely going to try this I was going to do my acrylic nails today(I do them myself) but then I saw this and I loved it , I'll tell u the results
My nails are still ruined from getting acrylics over 2 months ago, and it costed soo much money and they looked bad. They literally made me bleed when they took the thingy that spins and files your nails and when I flinched he yelled at me.. and he ended up breaking off one of the tips from it. I definitely will be doing this from now on
Alexandra, how do you remove the nails when you want to take them off?
This changes  everything
Where can you buy nail tips
did she use flour?
hi
I've had my nails done so many times and everytime it was horrible experience. I can't find a good nail salon 😣😣
a drill bit only damages your nails if you don't know how to use it correctly and do excessive drilling.. you will RARELY see any nails as damaged as the pictures you showed from a drill bit, those are most likely people who tried to do it themselves and messed up. don't diss a product you don't fully understand, drill bits do the job faster and cleaner and should only be used by carefully trained professionals.
how do you remove it ???
Can i put this mixture of nail polish and corn starch on top on my onw long nails to make them more thick? To make them maybe last longer? Or it can only be with those fake nail tips?
DIDMY WORK AT ALL
Please make a "stiletto" tutorial! Or an almond one. :)
I will always show my friends this video on how the can save $40 for doing their nails
BLESS THIS VIDEO TOO!
can baking soda be used as a substitue??
my mom thought it was a waste and didn't want to give me the money to buy the nails but i bought them myself and they came out great now she wants me to do her nails haha thanks for the tip
Could you use any sort of powder ??
what is cornstarch at greek?  ☺
can u use anything else except from corn starch becuse I don't have any of that in my house . Mabry flower or something
Can you please do a tutorial like this again for French tips, I love the color but french tips are super pretty to me
I really want to try this but in the past I've tried these kind of diy nails and they would just pop off from just opening my wallet or whatever.. So I'm just wondering if this method is strong enough? Has anyone tried this? :)
What shape did you get your nails in? (:
How do you remove these?
The clear ones and whites ones aren't the same the clear were full nails so why even show them if you're working with tips and not full nails
That's so clever!!!!
Can u put the link down where can i buy that thanks
Omg amazing I'm going to try this on the holidays when school is on a break I'm 13 too
can you use the nail guide sticker things (sorry I forgot what their called)
this was so hard 😩
I've never gotten acrylics or gel nails but I've always been curious since I have really ugly stubby fingers and bite my nails and I think acrylics could make them more feminine looking.
Will try it. Thanks
helemaal verkeert maarja
Omg thank you so much I was expressing how my nail bed was too thick because I quit biting my nails and bam someone knows how to do it and I'm not insane what a relief I'm 17 and have stopped biting my nails for a while thank you 💖💖💖
Would it work if u used powder instead of corn starch?
is it regular cornstarch ??
what glue do you use?
Can you make a video on how you take the nails off?
Who else's nails look fake because they're really long naturally?
U can do it with a straw
I did this what a brilliant idea! I've been getting acrylic nails done for the last 10 years, who knew that I would be able to achieve the exact same look that I wanted from a nail salon at home for half the cost if that
I think this is beautiful I have been doing acrylics for a year
I have acrylics and when the guy was doing the drill thing ouch it was loud and he kept hitting my skin and it burned bad
I have a question. Is that safe? I mean, if I remove the fake nails. Will my nails look like drilled nails? Im just askinh
Would super glue work??
can you make a video on how you fill your eyebrows and make them look so natural?
What nail salon have you been going to?? I've never had any problems with mine but of course different area and different experience I guess. Great tutorial though...might try this.
Do these just pop off? Because a lot of times when I have glue ons they'll pop off randomly
What do you do if you do not have any tips???
I've seen a tutorial exactly the same as this a few months ago
Thx so much😘
יפה מאוד
How do you remove it?
i tryd this and its amazing :)
When they drill it it starts to bleed
How do you remove them?
Hey so this is a really bomb video and thanks for sharing it. By any chance can you show how to remove them? Thanks chica
I had acrylic nails 3 times and and now (literally all ) my nails (real ) are falling off 💦💦
I do my own acrylic nails so it's much cheaper and I don't use a drill so my nails aren't damaged. I highly recommend doing it yourself. Takes practice but it's nice to be in control.
girl you're genius 😍
how did a 13 old came up with this? you re a genius
What products did you use?
nice
5 months ago I got acrylics for the first time and I think I'm allergic to a chemical or something in them cause the skin around my nail swelled up and went bright red so I had to take them off 2 days later (😫)... Any way my cuticles are STILL not repaired and may nails are weak af! Anyway that's my story and ty for this wonderful tutorial ❤️
Where can i buy them because i was planning to get acrylics for my graduation but extremely scared of the pain of the fileing and this is a great alternative and less expensive
this is vidéo saved my nail life lol omg am so greatfull <3 i looooooooooooove it
i used a method for a few months that I came up with also, but I am really intrigued by yours since you don't need to file down the natural nail!
DO NOT DO THIS she dose not know her proper facts!!  It makes me vary upset that she is telling people false information. I am not against diys or anything but make sure you do your research!!!
What is the powder of the begining ?
You are a genious.
we used to call these Party Nails....designed to last the weekend and customer could easily soak them off themselves.
How do you remove them?
Nice
Great idea
Great idea
Thank you babe.
I tried this out and my nails look like they were done at the salon my friends liked it too so thank you so much for this video❤
What is the name of the colour nail polish she used? I need it !!!

I love this new easy alternative!! could you do a video on how to do these with stiletto nails?
I wish I saw this video yesterday. I just had acrylic nails done, yesterday. 😞😞😞
😍😍😍
Do you have a ratio of cornstarch to clear polish? I tried it and the mixture turned out way too thick and wouldn't dry
I followed her exact instructions & after 3 coats of a pink polish you can still see where the fake nail & my nail start. Any tips on how to eliminate this? Anyone?
what if you don't have corn starch
totally going to try this tomorrow!! Thank you!
i really dont have cornstarch around can u use bakingsoda or flour instead ?
Do you mix a top coat with the corn starch or a base coat?
I did it it was awesome but I think I applied too much top coat
Where do you get the clear nail things
Do an almond looking nail please😊 tutorial
Omg thank you so much, this saves my life! I don't have money to get acrylc nails haha
Please do a coffin nail tutorial and a stiletto one too!💕✨ love your videos

I've tried these over and over and for the life of me I cannot blend the plastic into my natural nail properly
i swear i thought they were real

Could you do this tutorial but with your less dominant hand as the one that's actually applying the nail and polish? I suck at polishing with my left hand lol
where do you get the tips?
So after a week can you fill them in, if so how? Or do you have to take them off and start over?? Really excited to try this!!!!🙂👍🏼💅🏼
Can I use something else instead of cornstarch
How long does it last
I don't have cornstarch .. Could you use anything else ??
YAAAAAS I will try this 😉
I think I'm gonna try coffin nails the next time I do mine. I use full nails, medium length because I had to cut my nails but I miss the length.
This is so creative omg

are you broke

THIS IS GREAT.... I WOULD LIKE TO TRY BUT I LIKE MY OWN NAILS NOT TIPS... BUT GREAT IDEA THO
Please do a stiletto tutorial :0
Hey beauty! Can you have a tutorial about how to remove nail-glue from your nails after you have removed your false nails? Because every time i remove my fals nails, it is alway some glue on my nails, so how should I remove it?
you should never ever put nails on that are too small, when you smash them down and flatten them like she does, they tend to crack and straight up fall off. its much better to get a tip that is too large and file to fit. and also your nails wouldn't look like that after you take off acrylic if you soak them correctly, she must not be. and the file should never ever hurt your natural nail, your nail plate is made up of over 100 dead cell layers, so buffing them to create a textured surface shouldn't hurt. if it does your nail tech is doing it Wrong. acrylic nails are easy and natural looking too, i like the way she did it here but honestly it doesn't seem like it would be better for your nails. just take care of your acrylics and natural plate and you'll be fine either way!
You could  use nail clippers  instead  of scissors  and you do have have plastic  on your fingers it's the tip. I love acrylics  they don't have to be thick they can be thin and  natural  looking and not damaging  either . you file the actual nail then primer it that way your nails will last longer then  a week . you can use a nail  filer instead of a drill . but if you want nails for a week then this is smart
@2:29 Thats Not True They Must Not Took They Nails Off Right Cause My Nails Didnt Look Like That
will it actually hurt when you remove them? i wanna do it coz my nails are really short but I'm scared if I will remove it.
Thank you so much!!!
I don't understand what she's saying on 02:10
The nails look like they are strong natural nails, you can actually fool people with these acrylics. That cornstarch and clear nail polish trick was excellent, I never would've thought of it.👍
I just did this! It's amazing! Thankyou for sharing!
and what kinda of glue, super glue or nail glue?
how do you take off the nails?
Du need the cornstarch and clear nail polish ??
Also what's the uk equivalent for cornstarch??
I always do my own nails. I shape the tips into an almond shape first them glue them down, file the top then add a final layer of glue to seal -  I find them really high maintenance and they always break off when I do even to most menial tasks. Does anyone have any tips on making them last
this is the most stupid video I ever see
what kind of glue did you use? is it super glu ?-.-
اكثر من روعه
Can you list everything we need to complete these nails in the description or tell me please
plz make an stilleto nail tutorial plz
Omg I loveee this. But can I use any substitute for the cornstarch?
I also hate that trend, like wtf is that thick nail, looks disgusting, so un-natural
i love this tutorial!! it's so helpful :)
Instead of corn starch, can I use baby power?
If had acrylic nail at home I got a kit it was easy for me, but really mess and had a strong smell..
That picture that you have showed "after acrylic removal" were done by someone unprofessional.  I am a nail technician and whenever i remove acrylics from my client's nails, they never look like that !
my 13 year old has been wanting tips,  but I've been encouraging her to polish her's since they grow and are strong.   I know how destructive most salon nails can be.  I am so excited to try your techniques!  you explained everything so well.   Do you recommend a specific top coat or will any do?  I can't wait to hear from you to do this with her.  it will be a surprise gift for her for her great school grades.
the problem is these are weak and snap off or break easy ..speaking from personal experience.
when i went to get my acrylics today it didnt even hurt when they used to drill thing
Because I'm only 12 they only apply the nail first they tell me to grow my nail but I don't and they just apply it so then they ask my mom what sizze😳
where'd you get your nail tips?
Any ideas if you dont have any nail glue??
I love this. Tysm, so helpful!!
Will this work if I used flour instead of cornstarch
please do a stiletto tutorial (: !
I love your videos! your voice is so relaxing to hear.
I never saw somebodey doing anithing with drill on natural nail. if somebodey is doing that it shoud stop😲😣😣😣 great video love you😘😍
this is great thank you!
You are a freaking genius!
that was amazing! why I've never thought of that? i will try it cuz it really makes sense  and omg ..u saved me tonz of money..tnxxx
I just really wanted to let you know that you are amazing and such a role model! I love you so so much💖 I know at the end you said they aren't damaged and they stay healthy, but do they stay the same thickness?
what can I use other then cornstarch?
Can you use baking soda instead of corn starch??
Love it! Couls you please make a list of the products you used? I didnt catch some of them :)
Can I use something else then cornstarch? 😊
do you know the cornstarch/nail polish you use?
why do my nails bend on
What would you do if it breaks or falls off?
Could you make a video on how to shape the nails in different style like coffin and almond shapes.btw love this tutorial
amazing very creative. love your voice and you do sound like andreaschoice lol xx
wow, I love that!
Do you use non acetone?
I have never had acylics but i tried a kit where you glued on a tip like you did it smelled so bad and did not work
I love it. just tried one nail today. totally happy. looks so cool. thank you:)
How to you do your non dominate hand
I'm totally gonna do this but how do you remove them without pain or damage?
what would the alternative be, because I'v never come across "corn starch" in the UK.  or is there another name for it? :/
i'm sorry i don't have a good sound .. what did you mixed with the corn starch?
You remind me of andreaschoice so much
Ive had acrylic nails multiple times throughout the span of a few years. the bulky acrylic nails you showed were the results of unprofessional people doing nails. my experience with acrylic nails is mixed slightly. When i have them, theyre wonderful and there is no work required. But usually the prices to remove the nails are outrageous (and yes i know this is a big no no) so i remove them myself, which is quite painful. another bad experience is that when swimming competitively or just for fun, water will make its way under the acrylic nails and this means you must get them removed and the fungus sanded off which is painful as well. but acrylics are nice due to the fact that the nail polish doesnt chip and its virtually impossible to break a nail. just some info for anyone considering getting them.
Wow I love this! I stopped doing acrylics because of the pain and after effects. Must try this out!
Can we use the nail glue that's like in the fake nails pack like a target
They don't use the drill on my nail but it HURTS like they shave more of my skin then nails
Yes! the drill is NEVER to be used on your natural nail.  If they stay doing that. ....WALK AWAY! !
Ur voice is like a boy
Love it
wear can you buy those natural looking fake nails that wont look huge on your fingers
Can you see the bump of the tip? This is so unique but I mean, won't you be able to see where the tip and your nail have been glued?
Can you do a review on deva curl?
Can you use semi - permanent gel on them?
you just a new subscriber!
If your to lazy to shape them just buy the tips shaped worked for me
I love diys
how do u take them off??tutorial??
at 0.32 what is she putting on the nails from that squeezy bottle?
if you properly soak acrylics off it doesn't do that to your nail or glue on tips my acrylics are free form and I have never had that problem of destroying my Natural nails.
I wish id watched this a week ago before i had thrown away my old nail file😪😂
what age would this work for? like would it work for an eight year olds hand?
I HATE THE TOXIC LIQUID THEY USE
You seriously have the best DIY/hacks videos. They aren't over the top and just real. Thanks for the great videos.
What color did you use?
Cute but not acrylic
does this work with flour
having problems making it look smooth transition from nail to fake nail. ..I see the bump. .what do u think I'm doing wrong
WOHOO!
Seem to be having a hard time putting the corn starch on. :/
U cant file hair😐
Also would you have to remove them the same way they do at spas still?
I really want stiletto please!
is there a brand of corn starch that you recommend?
I love your videos x  there amazing
What's the name of the  color?
OMG this is awesome!!
since baby powder has cornstarch in it , will it work the same?
This is awesome! I've definitely doing this.
Where do we get the nails?
can the corn starch be substituted
Omg, she has litterally the best tutorials. The other ones on YouTube are so hard to do but this is so easy and cheap. Her videos are amazing.
If you have clear nail extensions do you have to paint them
I did this last night! absolutely love this method now! saving money and killing the nail game. Thank you Alexandra
how long does a acrylic nail takes to be grown out
Would it still work if u used regular Colored polish instead of a clear one?
omg that is very creative, i should give this a try, I love substitutes for acrylics. I deffinetely give this 5 stars.
Can you do a vid on how to file down the nail to make it coffin shaped. Thanks! I LOVE YOU<3
Do you have to use acetone To remove the nail glue, or cud it just be any nail polish remover? Definitely gonna try this☺️
That "so dainty and beautiful" quote kinda made me self conscious 👀
Can you do a Gel manicure over the tips?v
I will definitely be trying this method.   How in the world did you come up with the technique?
Naaaa b i did this and the corn starch and buffing it away just didnt work it looks soo un natural it just looks soo bulky😳😰
it irritates my nails 😢 salon nails suck😑
I'm looking for a tutorial where someone uses the full nail...you used white tips, which weren't the same clear full nails you showed in the beginning. I'm very confused as to why you showed us that but didn't use them.
her voice sounds like andrea'sChoise' daimm
How long they will last??
How do you take them off?
So, are these easy to break off??
CORNSTARCH?!? This is genius. Pure genius. Thank you!!
the acrylic makes them strong and durable. does your nails break easily
Is there anything you can use instead of cornstarch
Curious are you able to put corn starch on all your nail beds as well. Like you do when you do acrylic? I know you put them on the area where the tip and nail area meet.
idk how stupid I'm gonna sound but if you replace the nail glue with the cornstarch mixture, will that make the nails last longer?
where did u get those nails
nice tutorial but after how we remove them???
Omg thanks so much I don't have much money and love doing my nails definitely plan on doing this☺️
How long do these nails last?
will these break or bend easily?
Is there an alternative to cornstarch
I think this is cool
i'm literally getting ready to go to town to get my nails done. think ill just go and pick up some bits and try and do my own. i hate when they file the nail down they pull your nails apart with their nails and that hurts like hell! Thanks so much for the tutorial x
Can I apply the Cornstarch mix all over my nail to make it thicker.????????????????
i shall subscribe
Can I use anything else instead of corn starch
@AlexandrasGirlyTalk Omg I love the nails,good job!xoxo
hi. i don't really get it , so , my question is what is cornstarch do ? i mean for some other reason ?
I am trying this for the first time and although attempt 1 wasn't horrible, I can still see the tip line. I notice that your tip. Where it is placed on the nail is curved like an "n" mine is Like a "u" does that meek a difference? I'm taking the polish off and trying to file the tip again
Which glue did she use
How did you come up with this method
do more
how would you do a fill-in? remove the nails and repeat process or?
How do you take them off? But the video is amazing thank you.
Brilliant!!! <3
could you use like baking soda instead of corn starch, i don't have cornstarch :(
Works soo well! LOVE IT😍🙈 thank you sooooo much!❤️😻🙈🐝
Instead of corn starch could you use flour ???
Can you make a video of you removing the nails?
Did anyone else just die a little seeing then drilled/buffed down nails ... I did 😭😭😭
You have the best tutorials and I love all of your hacks.  You are, by far, my fav YouTuber.  Keep doing what you're doing because I'm obviously not the only one that loves you (I see you have over 1 million subbies)!  Congrats!  Love you Alex!
omg i love this method! so clever, wish i could try it but i already decided to get gel nails):
im actually alergic to acrylics sooo this is awesome!!
What is the powder and that gel thing you used ?
do a video on how you remove them!
do they come off easily like if u doin something that your naild gonna get hit alot will they break?
what kind of glue did you use?
How do you take it off?
She sounds like Andreachoice ooommmggg
What color polish is that??
OMG!!! I LOVE nice nails; however, I ride horses and am out doing activities that are not nail friendly. These are awesome for wearing to an event or for a few days. Plus, if I DID wear them around the horses I would not have to worry about injuring them with those thick nails (I hate that look too). I am trying these tomorrow!!!
where do you buy the plastic thingys? this seems like such a great method  and i love your channel!!!!!!!!!!!!!
very clever! nails look goalz!! n no damage is the best thing, super cute will dfo try this 1
where did you order the nails from
What I'm wondering is what is stopping these from lifting. How are these staying on? There doesn't seem like anything to strengthen it. I've been thinking about using the acrylic as glue for a hack. Unfortunately, I've recently become sick and I'm unable to get to salon to have my nails done so I'm trying to find something to substitute and this looks like it may be my savior! I have however bought a Kiss kit to try out before spending loads on expensive products. Maybe now I won't have to! Great tutorial
My pinky nail is so long and thin! No nail fits it 😕
This should have wayyyyy more views, this is so clever xx
hey do you think I would get the same result if I use an electric nail file? like the ones they use in the nail salon? ive done it just like in the video and I always comes out fabulous. I was just wondering because my regular files always come out very dirty afterwards
Great job
Out of the dozens of DIY "acrylics" or at home nail tutorials THIS IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE. I love how natural and feminine they look. I just got acrylics for the first time in years because I broke a couple nails and really wanted them long for a special event. Dreading them coming off because my nails will be so damaged
how to remove nails?
I love the tutorial, they look beautiful but I still got to go acrylic just because unlike gel, nail polish is such hard work, it needs to be re done every 3-4 days and I just don't have the patience for that
I don't know what nail salons you've been to but they're not supposed to you those mechanical buffer things on your nails.
Can i just say that you are brilliant!? Wow.. I have seen so many "diy fake acrylic nails" videos and they are just no good. I have seen people use straws and then just get the whole nail you glue on and all that and this tutorial, by far, is the best one i have ever seen! For Sure going to do this 👍🏽💗
Youre like the best youtuber ever !!!!
Everyone asking for a stiletto tutorial: just cut yourself some long squared off tips like she shows in the video, then to get the stiletto shape use your scissors to snip the edges off diagonally. Like an upside down V shape. Then use your nail file to shape the sharp edges and round it all off. Done!
You're a genius!! I've been using the press-ons but they only go up to a certain length. So glad I stumbled upon this video.
Please do a tutorial on shaping stiletto nails! 😃😃
why name it acrylic nail hack if it's not acrylic at all? it's a cheap hack for a fake tip.... that's it
i neeed to do this!
Can you use flour instead?
are these waterproof? Bc i spend 2 hours in the pool every single day, would they survive?
How old are you?
can regular nail polish remover take them off?
You are awesome!   Do you ever use the full faux Acrylic nails & if so would you mind posting a video? I'm curious how you apply & remove them. Gracias! 💅
Where can I get glue for my nails? And how can I take off my nails with no pain??
I swear her channel has everything I need.
I want to see the stilleto tutorial (:
pretty
I've tried doing this a few times, I cannot seem to get the hang of this, how long do u file for ? Do u put a lot of the cornstarch n nail varnish on ?
Thanks so much Alexandra for saving me loads of 💵💵💵💵💵💵
omg! Ive been trying to find a way more safe way to do this and I think you have helped me! :) yayyyy I have one question though! Does it matter what color tip I use? Also what glue do you recommend using?Subscribe? :) love you
I am definitely going to use this! I've been wanting to get fake nails but was afraid of the damage but this tutorial saved my nails!
can I use potatoe starch ??? :DD will it work ??
Can u do a tutorial for an almond shape pls !
hi what is that powder you use? im dutch and i didn't understood what you said :) i going to try to do those nails!
How do you remove it? Maybe you can do it in a video?
You. Are. A. Life. Saver. I wanted Acrylic nails because my real nails dont hold nail polish well and I felt that with acrylics it would hold better.. and also look better. I asked my mom but she said no, because its super unhealthy for my real nails. (I'm 16.) This is such a better and healthier alternative, THANK YOU!!!
I've been doing it since I was 10 I already knew this you didn't come up with it its been around for a while
Love it ! 💓💓💕💗
lol wait you did not just insert pictures of random girls nails in this video just to say that you don't like them bc you like a "feminine nail" lmaooo
I thought I was the only one who ever did this I was so embarrassed freshman when they all popped off playing softball 😲😂
Watch this video literally 10 times a day!😍😊😘 Love you
What kind of clear polish did you use  to blend with the cornstarch?
What kind of glue did you use?
what kind of glue is best? how do you remove the "acrylics"?
It works perfectly! I ordered some nail extensions and did the cornstarch technique. I'll never need acrylics again (:
I play guitar so I can't have acrylic nails 🙄🔫
I wear acrylics but i would never ever let someone work on my natural nail with these electric things. if done correctly the natural nail is only slightly buffed with a regular file or a sponge.   I used this glue-on-method for a while because they're thinner, but I had the feeling that when they came off and I reapplied a new tip it didn't last properly anymore :/ also when they came off my nails hurt, weirdly enough.
these probably last 3 days
where can you get the nail tips I can't find them anywhere??
The nail technician that is buffing your nail shouldn't be able to file your nails down that much because that looks really bad in a make Them  break really easily when you get the acrylic taken off and whoever is doing your nail is isn't supposed to make it real thicktowards the cuticles because yes that does look bad when it grows out most of those nails up there probably weren't done by a licensed professional
How do you remove them?
I love the French look.  Will this work with leaving the white tips?
I do acrylic nails and there is absolutely no need for a drill to touch your natural nails I use a cuticle pusher and buffer to remove the cuticles and the reason why some people do them so thick is cause they usually last longer but also it adds more tension to your nail
KEEP THE DIYS COMING!
is she sister of this girl twin
why do people want fake nails ??
Where do you get the clear tips at
I've been doing this for years too!! Love this! The cornstarch is a good idea that I will incorporate into my routine! Thanks!
When the tips fall off,how can you get the glue off your nail?
You said exactly how I feel about my nail health and the look. My nails are narrow and I had to tell the nail tech no wide nails. I love glue on's and after two weeks I usually have ten beautiful nails. They wouldn't stay as hard as I like but I like your method and will give it a try and share. It's amazing what we come up with to save $ or have"the look" we want. I like your method for that reason and nail health. Thanks for sharing.
Thanks
Can u use flour instead or cornstarch
if your fake nail kit doesnt come with glue what glue should I use?
wow never seen this before,  amazing

How do you remove them??
What kind of glue did you use?

ahhh my nails never get damaged when removing acrylics
Where did you get those false Nails? :-)
I couldnt get this to work, it didnt file it just smudged away. :`(
Can I use all purpose flour instead of corn starch???
I tried this but when the cornstarch dried and I buffed it all of it flaked away and I was left with a bumpy transition from the nail to natural nail. what happened?
What nail glue do you all recommend so that they last for a week.
u r the most creative person ive ever watched im so glad i found u!
Omg I just did this and it's so good!!!!
I love this diy! .......But really I look forward to your videos and personally you should stop false advertising the reason you love Monday's cus you sure don't post every Monday !!
In a recent video you did you said you were 5'8. Im 5'7 and i feel very weird if i wear heels because im already so tall, but there are some outfits that would just look so great with heels and i don't know if I should. I want to know how you feel about wearing heels since you are around my height.
lol you posted this on my birthday😂 but anyway I love the video and I got acrylics the day before my bday and I am scared to take them off bc this was the first time i got acrylics😁

Alexandra! I'm a new subscriber and I just want to tell you I LOVE your videos, especially these DIYs! Can't wait to continue to watch your vids love!
do i have to use cornstarch? cuz i currently dont have any and really would like to avoid buying it right now (i know it portects my nails of course just want to know if i would be able to get the same effect without it
Can you use baby powder As substitute?
the nail does not match the thumb, but a beautiful pease of work
what if you dont have cornstarch??? can you use flour instead i love this hack but im lazyyyyyy
Ugh I just love all your video's There quick easy and SO INFORMATIVE
everyone I have my nails dome (acrylic) the nail technician makes the sides of my nails/skin bleed by over filing and then my fingers have unsightly scabs down the edges for about a week. so I've taken to doing my own. I love this tutorial, so helpful and informative x
what about your other hand lol.... I love your nails 💗💗
What did you use ?
Oh my God, that photo at 2:30 of the nails after removing acrylics...... I've never had fake nails done, I was thinking of it, but now I'm scared to lol
I have 17 years experience as a nail tech and I hate hearing stories about people having painful full set applications. It doesn't have to be that way! I don't use a drill on the natural nail ever! I use it to take bulk out of the acrylic and to shape. No doubt acrylics are damaging to the natural nails however you do it but it shouldn't be painful!
I am happy I found this video because I tried it out and it works great love this method do it people 😊
I love your videos but if you cover your whole nail with the fake nails and glue will it damage your real nails
*paints left hand* "Beautiful!" *paints right hand* "I need jesus!"
Love this
i dont like this method i tried it before when i tried to file it the cornstarch just caame right of  like , really 😒
how long can i keep them???
just so easy &  affordable .. but can you just list me with the  glue( pasting of nail) quality wise.
can you use something else for the cornstarch?
What nail polish?!
Can i use something else instead of cornstarch? I don't have it at home atm but i really want to try this, please help!! 😩
I Love  it
how do you remove them from your nails?
i get acrylics, and if the nail tech is drilling the natural nailbeds with no product that's totally wrong!
You honestly sound so much like AndreasChoice
Can you please make a video on how to remove these?
There's a new trend which I see that there is a paste kinda thing which they apply on their nails by brush and then they spread it? What's that Alexendra?
please someone say me what is cornstarch
I'm a cancer patient  so this is great news for my super thin nails. I will be giving  this a try I am also on instagram. would love to make a link to your site with my new YouTube channel in two months

I have a pic of my nails on my Instagram @__magnifique__
I loved this and did it! So much $$ saved! Thanks hun! 😄
how do you remove these nails? btw love this method so much.
Hi I totally love this tutorial and really want to try it out but first I would need to know how to get them off does any one have suggestions
btw did NOT now about washing the file to get it new like that, TOTALLY gonna try that :D thanks !
if they are drilling down many layers of your natural nail then maby your just going to a cheap ass salon, im a nail tech and u only need to buff the natural oily shine of the natural nail, sometimes i scratch the nail a bit with the side of my nailfile and thats enough =)  just put some alcohol on them and a good primer and then soak them off when you dont like the nails anymore. There, natural healthy nail HACK of the day.  Pay a bit more when you get your nails done , with a PROFESSIONAL.  Even if they use a drill, it should be on low speed just tickling the shine of the nails, not DRILLING THEM DOWN, then your getting MMA acrylic on your nails, poison. I use a drill to get closer to the cuticles without hurting the clients skin with a normal nailfile, and a cuticle bit i also use on my drill. Thats how the professionals do it !!!
Hi! I swim everyday for hours do you think these would hold up?
if you can you should share more vegan recipes♡
What color is that called exactly?
What nailpolish did you use?
yasss! great tutorial! thanks
I just tried it and it's fantastic since i haven't been able to get my nails done in years. This really is better than acrylic. I'm just having a little trouble getting it smooth enough to get rid of the ridge line between natural nail and fake tip.
Did this actually work for anyone?
This is amazing! so happy i stumbled across this vid
i do the same method. I thought i was the only one lol... Its cheaper and less damaging on the nails
Do a video of how to shape them how you want
You're awesome!!! 😊
oh man that image of nails was creepy lol. if I don't want my acrylics no more I just let it grow out and it falls off naturally.  and if I want them off immediately,  they take them off but it definitely doesn't look what that image had.
What is the BEST acetone nail polish remover

OMG.....My Mind is Blown Away... You gave me... my entire life with this one.👏👏👍👍💯🔥⭐
Instead of cornstarch can I use flour? Love you Alexandra!
Can anybody give me tips on how to blend the nail tip with my real nail? I file it down really hard and apply coats of clear nail polish but somehow you can still see the tip when I put nail polish on
How do you get them to last all week? One of mine feel off the second day. Am I doing something wrong???
hey :) can anyone tell me please why did she apply the tip in the middle of her nail and not covering the entire nail?  I've tried this method and i't amazing. But I find it difficult to file the part with the cornstarch, and to buff the tip at the same level of my natural nail.  Help me please :(💖
wait..u dont have to add acrylic to those?
I like thick acrylic nails..😃
how often do i have to remove the nail tips?

Hey I was wondering what makeup brands you use and are they cruelty free? P.s. I love youu 💓
I dunno where you went but those drills nails were prolly drilled with a carbide bit on the drill and anywhere that uses carbide on natural nails is bad bad baddddd.

I love this technique i will be trying this thank you so much 😘
If you want a natural look just grow your nails out & it'll look even better. But if you personally prefer this method than do it. No hate just stating my opinion.
I have a question. Where did you get your white/ clear nail tips? Can I get them at the dollar store or drug store? Or just a beauty supply store? 🤔
hi if we use the glue then how to to remove and when can we remove
preaty great
what nail polish did you use? its gorgeous😍
Alexandrasgirltalk  could we use different type of powder or do we have to use cornstarch???
your nails really don't look different from fake ones.
how long does it take for the cornstarch in clear nail polish to dry? please answer my question
can you talk about your hair color 😊
Alright😂 I've been getting my nails done/removed for YEARS now and those pictures you have shown are NOT what your nails look like if you take acrylics off PROPERLY. If you soak them and GENTLY remove the nails, I GUARANTEE you that they will not look like that. That is a result of peeling the nail off. Which is PAINFUL, yes. That is what damages your nail. If you go to a salon, they aren't going to damage your nails on purpose like that, they clip/file off the length, remove polish, soak the nail, and gently and gradually remove the nail. They don't just pick and pry and ruin your nail. Then they thoroughly clean your nail, along with applying a cuticle oil and probably a strengthener or hardener to protect your nails. And the drill does the EXACT same thing a regular file does. Idk where you got your information or what salon you went to but it's wrong😂
but how does that hold, I find that any nail glue on just will snap off with out a cure of anything like I would be worried to open anything grab something without them just falling off.. what's holding them on other than little glue and a top coat?
Water proof ? 😛
does anyone know of a uk alternative for the nail tips? thanks!
love this as I like the natural look!!!!!!!
first i am a nail tech and here are some things that are absolutely wrong and incorrectly done. The tips need to go on the nail side wall to side wall - just the preview on the thumb you can clearly tell that its not the correct size for that nail. second you do not apply glue to your nail, you apply it to the nail tip and rock the tip onto your natural nail. And the most important thing here is the picture you should of " drilled nails" the damage on the nails is caused by  MMA which is illegal to use in any salon in the US. If you are trained to do manicure and enhancements then you will never harm a clients nails.
OMG PLZ DO A STILETTO NAIL TUTORIAL ILYSM
so gorgeou nails

I am so great full for this method! I tried it out today and it is absolutely stunning and I've gotten so many complements on my nails. It's so economical and easy to do!   THANK YOU SO MUCH ❤️  Regarding acrylic tips, I loath them. They make my nails so weak that I have to wait for the damaged nails to grow out for them to appear healthy again. Plus they are so painful like you have said. I LOVE this method, do try it out it will change your life!!!!!!!
i did this today and omg they came out awesome XD
This is so cool!

What are safe removal methods without damaging the nail bed?
This is gorgeous! MUST TRY!
It's a great idea, would u be able to use like a clear/transparent/French  polish for a natural look without seeing any joins through the polish? 💅🏼 X
this method is absolutely not new....and she didn't invent it....That's weird for someone to say that....and Acrylics when done properly shouldn't ruin the natural nail.
this is so good n not much hurting the nails..luvvvv it...👍
how am i gonna do my right hand😂
What glue do you use?
How durable are they?
Oh my god this is so useful for cosplaying characters with long fingernails! I've used press-on nails before but of course, there's always that ugly harsh line where the false nail is so much higher than the real nail. Cornstarch and clear polish - genius!
WoW this method really works👍I used the brush of the clear nail polish. I needed a fill so I tried this method and it looks like acrylic from a nail salon. Thanks!!
i have been debating if I should get acrylics bcs I love long nails but I don't know if I want to put my nails trough that damage I'm so glad u shared this I'm definitely going to try it
Does anyone recommend a nail glue for this? Preferably not too expensive, please & thanks!
Can you please do more what I ate vegan videos? They are great and give me a lot of new food ideas.
Definitely wanna try this and actually every time I do my nails I ask for them to skip the drill
thank you
Do you need the base coat to make this work right?
Girlllll, I literally just watched almost all of your videos in the past week. And I want to know if you'll be able to make a work out routine! Your body is KILLER
how would you remove them?
Thanks for this tip,  totally love the video, I used to be so embarrassed because I would put the press-on's but they'd look so chunky and I've just completed one hand and it looks so beautiful
Awesome video! How do you remove them?
I just got acrylics for the first time and they totally ruined my nails :( They are like paper now and I have huge ridges where the acrylics started
Omg I always learn soo much when I watch your videos! Thanks for making them!
You're amazing! Thank you! <3

I wish I could do my nails like that. But I can't, coz my hands Grow from the wrong place, so every time I try to do something creative, it ends up looking like shit😬😂😞😞.  By the way, it's a great video and a great channel!:)
Looks beautiful! :)
Thank you so much I've been following you for a while and you always have such amazing videos. Also for you ladies out there who do get full sets it's ok, but be aware that salons that use a drill on your nails is incorrect. it is the old way of doing a set and all they need to do is use a fine file and buff just a little. so next time you go to the nail salon tell them to just use a file and buff instead of wearing down so much of your nail.
You have been going to the wrong wrong salon if your nails ended up hurt and damaged. Acrylic doesn't damage the nail, a bad nail technician does.
Hey mine always fall off after 20 mins.. Any suggestions?
This is amazing and I will definitely do this!Thank you for sharing!
congratulations on reaching 1 million. I've been viewing your videos for over two years and have loved watching your channel grow !! you went from a few thousand subs to a million by the snap of a finger. (,; ily
what type of glue? does it matter?
Amazing video
great idea but i have been wearing acrylics for 15+ years and if i had to remove them now, i have very minimal damage. the filing u showed here is extreme and a good nail tech will not do that to ur nails. i think that people bash acrylics because they just did not find a good nail tech or cannot afford it. most good nail techs do take proper care of ur nails.
How to make your own fake nails  STEP ONE: buy fake nails
I have been a nail technician for 35 years and I have seen a lot in my career. One thing that you should know when doing a method like this is that you can very easily contract a mold or what we call the greenies from this method. I don't care how long you say you have been doing it, you have been lucky. Someone who has their hands in water could easily get it between the nail and the cornstarch and polish. I am not talking about a fungus under the nail. It happens when you get water trapped between the nail bed and whatever is on top of the nail. It only takes a day or two for this to happen. Saving money could cost you a fingernail. And you don't have to have the drill used on the natural nail to have acrylics or Gels done. I never use a drill. Just tell the nail tech to lightly etch the natural nail and don't rip them off when you take them off, soak them in acetone. Ripping and picking them off ruins the nail more than the file does. You need to educate yourself.
How do you take them off? What do you use?
What was the glue she used? I want to do this so bad, but was it nail glue?
can we use baking soda insede if corn starch?
IM SO EXCITED TO TRY THIS!!!!! Thank you for this EXTREMELY helpful video, love you and your channel!!! 💖💖💖💖💖
thank you so much for the amazing tutorial! I will definitely be using this method. Would you mind linking where you got your fake nails down below?
how long does the 100 pack of nails last?
absolutely love this! i miss having nice nails but it just got so expensive i had to stop... im just worried about how to take off the tip? Since its glued, it wouldnt come off with nail polish remover and if i pull it off it will just ruin my natural nail... help? :)
what she applied 4:20?
A video with this technique Was uploaded in Youtube ITALY a year ago
My nails still looked healthy when I did acrylic nothing like that image she inserted
She sounds like Andreaschoice when she talks........ anyone agree?
Can you make a video showing how you remove them?
Love!!! Can't wait to try this! Please do a tutorial on almond and stiletto shaped! 💗
How do i remove them when i want it off?
what ws d clear liquid u apply after pushing UA cuticle back?!
love this!! i have had some bad experiences at nail salons and have stopped going for some time :( this is perfect and will definitely give it a try. Gracias! :)
Do a stiletto tutorial please
I just tried this and it came out amazing!!! As long as you let everything dry before filing it down it turns out so smooth and seamless! Love this thank you so much! ❤️
I love you
I love you
I get the acrylic nail kits from the store and do them myself. it takes practice and I would advise watching a lot of videos on it that's filmed by nail techs!
You are my idol!! Thank you for this! 💗💗💗
Don't apply just a dot apply it to the rim of the fake nail otherwise it will fall off or lift at the corners quicker
The fact that you came up with this when you were 13 speaks volumes.Firstly - I am a nail technician. I pride myself on applying extensions that are not super thick because, like you, I hate the overtly fake look. And any nail technician that causes your nails to become super damaged or causes you discomfort needs to take time to train and practice more.That being said, I take issue with your application reasoning. The reason we apply liquid and powder or a hard gel is to give the whole nail plate strength, particularly at the stress point. In your case, the stress point is where the tip meets your nail. If you catch that superglued on tip without adequate protection then you risk ripping or separating the layers of your nail which can cause growth issues down the line. I do agree with tips too large though. A sculpted nail is my preferred method as you can get cleaner sidewalls.That being said, the final look is lovely overall and I love the gorgeous feminine nail colour you have chosen.
I used to get my nails done & got nail fungus badly, where landed me in the doctor's..! Started doing my own with fake nails glued on. My own were never messed up any more under the nails. Great watching your video, hope more women follow you..! Thank you
Proper acrylic application will not ruin your natural nail as shown in your photos. Those look like someone has ripped their acrylic nail off which would have taken layers of natural nail bed with it.  I do like your application though for quick and easy one-week/no commitment nails :)
And it doesn't have that GOD awful smell!
I got acrylics years ago and it damaged my nails, they are extremely thin and it's been hard for them to grow. They started to get healthier but I've been wanting to do acrylics again & didn't want the damage! Then I saw this video, truthfully will it make my nails weak again or will it do minimal damage?
PLEASE DO A STILETTO ACRYLIC  NAIL TUTORIAL!!!
Can you tell me all the things you used in the video? And where I can get the same things。
Acrylics aren't damaging to your nails if you go to American nail salons and if you remove them properly. Asian salons are awful and no one should get their nails done there. They don't know proper sanitation and most of the "nail techs" aren't even licensed. Save yourself and go to an American salon if you're going to get your nails done. They're more expensive but so much safer.
Im think the nail polish she used is "mauve over" by londontown lakur
I have natural long nail and have acrylic on it ...if I take off the acrylic .. Will I be able to put the corn starch all over my nails to protect it
I did this earlier, but didn't get there clear nails 😦, and I can see the line where I glued the nail & I buffed it out so much, also nail polish I used left with bubbles. not sure what I am doing wrong. trying to save money & time. 😩
do a stilleto nail tutorial because I really like how they look!
Is it just press on glue ??
What exact products are used?
I love this! but I'm so lazy lmao
1 MILLION OMG YASSSSSS OMG IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU EEEE
congrats on 1 mil babe😘
Do they bend easily?
What kind of brush can you use?
This wouldn't last an hour on me but I guess everyone is different. I wish my nails weren't so soft and peeling all the time. I think if I had better natural nails it may work. Turned out pretty and thank you for not using a tip that's too big. I see it all the time on diy nail tutorials. Everyone uses a full nail or tip that is too big. It looks bad. Yours turned out great!
Could I use some other kind of powder?
I'm trying this tonight. Wish me luck! 😁
I'm in loveeeee with this!! I just tried it out and it works great, I'm so happy haha I've been trying to figure something like this out for months! thanks so much ❤️❤️❤️
can you do a workout routine  video  please
Hi! I LOVE this tutorial! But I have a question, what if I don"t have any cornstarch  is there anything else in my pantry I can use? Perhaps cornmeal? sounds weird I know...
what kind of glue did you use??
how long do you wait for the corn starch + clear polish to dry before filing it down?
Alexandria help me ! I put the cornstarch on the nail and now idk ? It's like the corn start all comes off when I file I'm waiting for it to dry but it still comes all off completely 😒.
can u tell me if the nail tip is flimsey . because normally the acrylic keeps the nail tip hard
"You're not going to find this anywhere else", I'm a professional nail technician, and just wanted to let you know that this method is called 'party tips', and as the name implies, is not meant to last longer than one or two nights/a weekend. A common option for prom. It's a method that has been around since the early 90's :)
Girl thank you! I actually really like acrylics but I hate them at the same time. I'm not even lying, my nails take about 4 months to get back to their healthy state AFTER acrylics. So I haven't done them in years. I will definitely try this method out! ❤️
I got my first set acrylics at 12 years old,and I only had them for like 6 weeks,because I didn't have any money,and they grew out too long and most fell off,and I didn't want to get a new set because it hurt so bad

what base coat do you use?
Hello
I work at a home decor store (which means I have to wrap and put away things A LOT) I also wash the dishes by hand almost everyday .  Does anyone know if they would last? If so, how long?
how do you remove them  ans did it hurt the nails after? plz
What nail glue did you use ?
Do they withstand manual labor and being submerged in water? I work in a pet store and I do alot of heavy duty stuff so my nails always look like hell and I hate it.
can u use this method with gel if so how would it be start to finish?
How do you take them off?
How do you remove them?
Firstly, your supposed to fill the well of the tip with glue (not just dot the tip of the natural nail) so as to prevent air bubbles which can cause your tip to pop off. Secondly, I don't know where you're getting your acrylics done, but a reputable salon/technician shouldn't damage your nails like the pictures you showed. Any filing of the natural nail is purely to "rough up" the surface ie. take the shine off so the acrylic, tip etc adhere to the natural nail. It should NOT hurt or cause injury.
Where can you buy clear tips??
Does it hurt if they bend back or break??? 💗💗💗
what glue do you use
Best video I have ever watched on youtube. Thank you!!

Hunty a bunch of people figured this out when they were younger

I have started doing this it has saved my life ❤️💅
i love ur voice😂😂😂u sound like one of those ppl that are always funny and tells the funniest jokes in the squad
I've been waiting for this tutorial for so long 😍

I did this it was amazing and my nails actually growed longer
Really interesting video. Gonna try this . before I do. If I haven't got any cornstarch, whay other powder could I use.
where did you get the nails
Lol where do you go to do your nails? Those drilled nails look horrible. Where I go they never do that to mine
You know how acrylics are supposed to last two or more weeks well mine lasted 5 days and I spent $45 and I was madd
More nail shape tutorials please! 😍😍
Does it work on short nails
I MUST TRY THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH I WANNA CRY I AM SO TIRED I CANNOT LIVE WITH MY UGLU CRUSTY NAILS WHEN I TAKE THE ACRYLICS OFF. I WANNA CRY RIGHT NOW YOU ARE AMAZING
I love this ! My nails are so thin from going to the nail shop definitely gonna try it !!
Well, if you dont want to damage you nails, you should probably pick a professional, not a nailsalon by the corner... If you continue to do this method you can have fungus...
What if you wanna do a fill how would you go about it?
last time I got acrylics nails the product and glue was so strong so when I hit my finger , my entire natural nail ripped off
Must you file all the corn starch stuff off?
I did it!! Its pretty!!💋💋💋
can i use baking powder or baking soda instead?
If you dont have corn starch, what esle can you use
Awesome video. You need to go to a new nail tech though because it should NEVER hurt.
Well I think yours look pretty great cause you happen to have an awesome size of nail bed. Now I would ask you how long have you bin a professional in the field ? You sound very wise although my 40 years as a professional tell me there is much more to be said on the topic.  Did like your video . Thank you but even with a small amount of  evenly application of acrylic with minimal amount of harsh  stuff ,  when you do break a nail its cause you were confident enough to wear them even when cooking or washing your hair .   Maybe for a ONE very special nite.... Fast and easy....Thank you  😊
Ewww the nails drilled at the salon looks so nasty I'm never gonna go now lol also I'm gonna subscribe lol
Can kids do this💃🏽🍼👯👭👫
what clear polish do you use and where do you get it?
super glue? what glue?

OMG THANKK U OML 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
do they break easily? btw thank you so much for this tutorial 💗
Hi! am i´m the only one that have problems with cutting the acrylic nails? When i tried to cut them, they broke
How'd you get rid of the plastic that surrounds the curved part
superb idea!!!  wow!!!! x
Do you need the cornstarch with the clear nailpolish
best nail tutorial, just tried it and this idea works so well 💕
This is amazing! Does anyone know what glue she used?
The won't last as long because they will bend or brake . I tried this before and it last about a week . And I was sad but it was cute so it's a great idea. But when it bends or breaks it's damaging your nail too .
I do acyrlic nails and I don't use a drill on the natural nail because that is so damaging to the natural nails . I only use it a 150 grit file & this is safe because acrylics are expensive , even when you buy the kits . There are still stuff you need to buy . That the kits don't include. The acyrlic sticks to your natural and forms and it last about 2-3 weeks . But it all really depends who your nail technican is .
COME OOOOOOOOON GURL ! Cornstarch + top coat? really? faux acrylic? It look so crusty. If the drill is buffing too much of your natural nail, change your nail artist RIGHT NOW ! It's been 5 year that i wear acrylic nails, sometimes I remove them to make my nails breathe. My nails still healthy, not yellow, strong... So... Better take a good nail artist then pay less then 5$ for a manucure ;)
Can they go under water
I don't usually put on false nails because I'm quite a practical person, so would these still stay on for at least a week?
Can someone tell me where I can buy the acrylic extensions from
came across ur video I don't like when they strip my nails so I don't go will try this thank u so much for another alternative😍😱
I had this shape of nails in nature so i grow my nails and put nail pulish and it looks like the acrylic nails.
Could you apply the clear nail polish&cornstarch mix to your whole own nail instead of only the space between the tip and your uppernail? Because I think if you do that, they will act like real acrylic nails and will last longer but then without the damage. Because nail polish on my nails only stays for two days and then chips and I want to have it stay for two weeks as well as the nails. And I know you can achieve that by fake nails full on so that is why I asked about the mix on your full nail. I love you so much!
A drill actually takes about 50 layers off your nails.
I love this!!!
This is brilliant! I have a load of nail tips kicking about in the house because I never really wanted to do my own acrylics because of the damage that they cause. Definitely going to be giving this a try!
I just now noticed your alexanderaschoice sister !Yay!..... Wait you are right?
My mum has acrylic nails on and she asks me advice on what colour to get next and since its summer soon I said a bright pink
PLEASE DO A STILETTO TUTORIAL
omg most definitely going to try this out l love acrylics but hate getting them done bc how bad it hurts and they never really come out the way I like. I'm excited to try. THANK YOU FOR THIS xo
can i use flour instead?
I'm also 13 and I haven't had acrylics yet because of how sensitive my nails are so this might be a dumb question but how do you take these off?
This was a great video
They look so natural, I really like them.
What nailpolish is she using?
What nailpolish is she using?
5:34 😱😱😱😱😱
this was smart. Im impressed but you know you can just buff out the nail tip and get it smooth before you apply it...We had to learn how to do that to pass the board for or nail license.
this is amazing omfg
Seeing this before prom is going to save some friends of mine's lives! I'm doing this tomorrow morning for some of them that are going
What's the name of the polish used? It's so pretty!!

what type of glue do you use.? thank you so much for this video♡
Where did you buy these?  I can't find anywhere!!!!!!
what glue did she use? super glue?
i do my own acrylic and gels and they arent thick and my natural nails look nice. after two months my nails get long enough where i stop using tips and i just use the acrylic or gel. also when i do other people nails i use a drill only for the acrylic but lately i have hand filed everything. my nails were not drilled as excessive as I seen in the photo when I was going to the nail shop but they were drill down pretty far and I believe they do that so that you have to come back to them sooner or you have to keep coming back to them because your nails are so thin you need something to protect them but yeah that's why I start doing my own nails. And also, that is why I start doing my friends Nails because we didn't want to go to the nail shop because they over file and they use a drill to do it and they eat up your nails with the drill ....now, you can use the drill and not end up with your nails really thin but a lot of people don't know that because they will use the drill and actually put pressure on it when the drill can do the work itself
How do you do the other hand on yourself when you already did one ?
This was ingenious.  Loved this.
completely impressed....
Are there any professionals out there who know if this is safe to do? Great tutorial, though!
OMG!!!!!Thank you for sharing
Could I use potato starch instead? X
Hi, what's the Nail polish? thx :)
how do you remove this?
Where did you get the nail tips?
Great tutorial!!   I have a channel, would love of you guys checked it out & subscribed :)
It's very amazing 😍
I am going to try this...such a good idea...
What your doing will hurt the nail, you should try Signature Nail System.This will work. what your doing will not last as long and does not professional look good.
Where can you buy the clear nail? It's the first time I've been introduced to them
where  did u get the nails from?
How long does it stay on for? Also how do you take them off?
How do you get rid of the nail ?
How long does this last??
she almost sounds like AndreasChoice to me
I'm going to do this
How do you take them off? Is it safe to do it for only 2 days? I want to try for the weekend but I'm not allowed falsies for school ☹
Girl! You always have the BEST hacks/tips! Every other YouTuber that makes this kind of video is trying to sell a damn product😠 I click on it thinking I'm gonna get some cool at-home tips, but when I go to watch it... They're trying to sell NailHur or something like that! But not you :) thanks so much💕💕
I feel like this girl is just trying to get us out of salons by showing us disgusting pictures of horrible nails.😑
DO A VIDEO ON HOW TO DO PERFECT HIGHLIGHT LYSM🙈👩‍❤️‍👩😍❤️✨😋😏😈😛👍💁🏽😜🤗
Please do how to shape COFFIN nails pls!
I had acrylic nails for around 4 months, but my nails never got to look like the pictures you showed in the video. they were slightly weak, so I had to keep them short, but now after a month they are back to normal
I have these and it came with a powder idk what is the powder for
about a year ago, I got acrylic nails for the first time, and they completely destroyed my nails. my nails used to be thick and strong, but now, they are very thin and break easily. :( do you know any way I can make my nails stronger?
How are we supposed to do this on our right hand ? 😂 Coz I can't do it with my left hand .
Wear did you purchase the nail tips???
They actually look good <3
Everything that was said in this video is so stereotypical and wrong!!!!! I hate when all this accusation is made about artificial nails, it gives it such a bad name.... If it's done right it won't damage the natural nail!!!! Educate yourself in nails before saying all of this.... 😤😡😡
Do you have to clip your natural nails before you do this?
Thank you so much this is much healthier for your nails. Have a good weekend
Your voice is so 😍
Please do the stiletto
you applied the cornstarch and  the stress area of the nail.  what happens when you bump one of your nails or it gets bent back?  on any false nail the stress area has to be re enforced.
This video is literally life
AND can u take off the polish without loosening the actual nail??
sooo.. they don't last as long as regular acrylic
Ohmygod I didn't realize that it wasn't andreaschoice until the end
So you are right handed, whose going to do your left hand nails? Good video xx
Will CVS or Walgreen's have these tips?
does anyone know of any good glues that last a while but don't damage your nails?
With these artificial nails ..dont u feel dat u cant hold or lift anything properly? Bcz it feels like u r hvng something which is gng to loose plz rly bcz it will be helpful for me if u replied thank u : )
why didnt u upload this last year?. I have to go to the nail salon every month and get them done.. also it makes me poor. :( Wish I knew how easy it is to do it at home.
Where ya get ur nails tips ?!?

Am I able to buy the clear tips at a drug store, such as rite aid?
This is horrifying technique. If you are afraid of acrylic. Watch some videos on NailCareerEducation. I found there so many information.
What glue did you use ?
I've never had my acrylics removed I just wait for them all to lift and fall off. 😊
I'm gonna try this ♡.♡
I'm curious if you can do regular house chores with these nails?? They look so fragile.
How do you take them off?

Omg thank you so Much Will try This tomorrow
Won't using the smaller nail extensions lead to ingrown nails? It's gonna pinch the natural tip when it grows
If done properly, and removed properly acrylics should not damage the natural nail bed at all. If they are taking a drill to your nail I would run fast! You are much better off just using a press on nail over the whole nail and wont need to worry about filing at all.
What nail glue did you use to glue the tips to your fingers?? I can never find a good working nail glue, it's so frustrating
Properly applied acrylic or hard gel nails DO NOT damage the natural nail plate, and will look much more natural and beautiful than ... Whatever this is. Please ... If you're not trained and licensed as a nail tech, you do more damage than good when publishing "tutorials."
I've seen this before honey you did not come up with this.
You don't know how quickly I bought everything you mentioned off of amazon after I watched this 😳 can't wait to try!!!

Do you use acetone to remove these? Also, if you like the fake, thicker looking look, can you put the cornstarch all over the nail and the fake nail?
How do u get them off? Does the glue break down from nail polish remover? Thanks!
Perfect!!!
How to remove?
Akrilik paints in Telugu.
OMG this is soooo awesome and original. I wish I could do them but I work as a barista!  Oh well!
what glue did you use? xxx
is it strong?
You're just so super smart. Really! All your videos are so helpful for me & this one was just as awesome! :)
I think it's great that you make these DIY videos. But as someone who does nails professionally please make sure that you don't misinform people. That's not what your nails should look like after using a drill if done properly. And it shouldn't hurt. Don't mistake someone's uneducated procedures with how acrylics actually work. If done properly it should be a painless, and easy removal/application. And nail tips shouldn't be used without acrylic or hard gel. They're not strong enough for that, and that's not how they were made. Don't make Nail Technicians look bad and shed a negative light on those who do this for a living.
Does anyone know anywhere where I could buy these online?
So I've been watching this video over and over again.... and I'm still so amazed on how they look! I've always used acrylic nails ever since I was about 13 I'm now 15. when I would try to remove them I would use everything you can think of. I would cry literally scream and rip them off ( I was young I didn't know 😂) I guess my question is, would this DIY work if I want to cut them short. not too short but also not too long. I don't want long nails. i do sports so that's one thing that's keeping me away from those. if you could write back I would highly appreciate it❤️❤️❤️ I love your videos and keep up the FANTASTIC work!! 🤘🏼❤️
This video is brilliant!
Love love love! 😍 Very creative!
How do we remove these? love this ❤😍😍

what kind of glue did she use to apply the nails ?
This is so awesome !! I will definitely be trying it out 😯🤗 thank u!
This is so horrible. You will get fungus underneath your nails because what you're doing is a temporarily acrylics set. Smh. DO NOT DO. I Am a nail tech

How long does it take for the cornstarch and clear polish to dry?
can you use something else instead of cornstarch ???
The only reason why you can wash the nail file is because it's wet-dry sandpaper
Question!! Do you have to use cornstarch? Can you use something else like baking soda?
alexandrasgirlytalk Where did you buy the clear nails from
I loved that nail polish colour that you put on - what was it called
This is so creative love! 💜
finally!!!!!
can't wait to try this! thank you so much for this!
O My GOD u do not know by making this video u hve just saved my life. I got acrylics done and before dat my nails were so good but when I took them off after about 2 weeks off having dem my nails were so weak.ive tried everything to make them strong but nothing is working I'm scared to do this diy acrylics but they r better than acrylics so I might try it. I love u so so much for making this video. can u tell me a way to make my nails strong? plz reply
I really wanna try this!
If you are going to make a nail tutorial make sure you know what your talking about. Fist of all you washing the file you are going to use is a no no you have to sanitize and disinfect in an epa approved disinfectant. And when you are going to apply tips they have to be side wall to side wall you can put a tip and then push it down acrylic shrinks once it's dry. Many things wrong with this video and for the people that actually enjoyed  it makes me really mad! You can learn from someone that is actually a nail tech and knows what they are doing. She should just stick to doing makeup
Yesss
Your nails look so good!
AH! This is amazing :) I'm a cruelty free Youtuber too - you go girl ;)
OMG, this is AMAZING!  Thank you SOOOO much for sharing!
how do you remove these?
laura miller, is that you?! :D you two sound really alike
The only reason anyone's nails would be that damaged is if the nail tech didn't know what they were doing or the client ripped & popped the acrylics off themselves ... That's grotesque
I would love it if you could do a stiletto nail tutorial :)
How did you come up with this at 13? I'm 15 and would've never thought of this :)
What's the color of the nail polish ???
Hi Alexanda, can you kindly listed what you used?  I dont know what you put on.  what was that clear colour with white powder? sorry if you've mentioned it.   I'm hearing impaired.  Thank you
That nail tech that drilled your nails is terrible.. It should NEVER be filed that low.
only one week? :(
I love this! I absolutely am going to try this. I have never had acrylic nails, I was afraid of ruining my natural nails. Thanks for the tutorial!
Omg this is awesome!!! Thank u
how old was she ?
How did you even come up with this? 😂😂😂
what kind of glue did you use ??
YOURE GENIUS
this is amazing im gonna give it a try
when you put the fake nail on with the glue how do u take that off?? do u place ur nails in warm water nd wait 4 them 2 fall off???
well is very unique. i love them. maybe i will give a tried. xoxo.
Just ordered some nail tips online soo excited to do this <3
Whenever i put nailpolish on fake nails it just doesnt dry.. Even if i wait like 3 hours they always get messed up and not dry completely
Where did you get the nail set from
She reminds me of Andreaschoice. Can't wait to try this!
Which kind of glue is she using? Is it a specific nail glue? Please help i wanna try it out as soon as possible!! 😳
Yall I did it and it works i put it all over like acrylic nails tho
I am sooo going to try this!! thank you so much for sharing!!! :) 😘 *thumbs up*
Can u use flour instead of cornstarch

Is there any alternatives to use to replace the corn starch?
Great! Going to try it.

There horrible but there really nice
Love this idea. I'll try it next time my nails need a break from my acrylics.
Is it just me or does the stilleto looks weird
can you do a video on how to remove the acrylics safely?
OMG!! BEST TUTORIAL EVER!!!!
What's the name of the nail polish color
Omg I've always been doing that and thought I was weird lol using those products budd I used banking powder
You didn't come up with this. Many people have done it way before you.
omg thank you!
The bad thing is, The false tip can cause to much tension and pressure on the natural nail bed since it is glued on half way . Therefore, too much pressure on the nail tip can cause redness and discomfort on the natural nails if not careful.
I tried this nail thing 😊and I completely fell in LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!! Best thing ever
What can we use other then corn starch ?
so how do you remove them?
As a nail tech, a good nail tech would never file your nail down with an electric file to that extent in the pictures you've shown and it definitely shouldn't hurt during or after! They should only be using an electric file on top of the acrylic to shape and the only time an electric file would be on your natural nail beds is with a very dull tip with a minimal amount of time to scuff them up very slightly for the extensions (and this can be done with a hand buff anyway). Very interesting method however.
Acrylics are the powder product used on the nails not the plastic tip. Sorry but this was a fail.
what kind of glue do you recommend, and what other alternatives can I use to stick it to my natural nail ? I will really appreciate your answer.
I used to do my nails back in the 80's like that before nails salons existed!!  I didn't used cornstarch I used a powder and liquid that I brought beauty supply.
bruh acrylics no more
I learned a lot from you tutorials thank you so much 😍 and this idea OMG you saved me lots of money thank you
These aren't acrylics.. They're just fake nails🤔
How do you take them off?
do the stiletto's one ❤
This was so amazing!! I have never seen anyone do this before! I have such an aversion to acrylic or getting my nails done professionally period because it was so incredibly painful. I would get my nails done a ton during high school & college & I just don't do it anymore because it was so uncomfortable for me. My nails are super thin & break easily now & I wonder if it's just the way my nails are or if it's because of the years of acrylics. Thank you for sharing this!! I'm still just in awe of it!
Where should i find the tips
can you get these wet and not worry about them loosening?
Girl on 1:02 the nails look prefect! !
Can you show how to do the stilleto? By the way love the idea, I'm going to try it!😀😛
I feel like Im going to sound dumb but whatever.. When you get your nails done at the salon what do they do to your nails? Ive been thinking about getting mine done for a while but idk.. and those pictures kind of freaked me out..
Girl I love you!
Doesnt hurt was satificed
Yes!  This is way easier for me, not very many complicated steps and no ruined nails after they come off!  Thank you for this video!

Haha love her but the last picture of the "chunky" nails were my sisters haha no joke she put them on Pinterest and now they are in a YouTube video... Haha love you tho
U saved my life
Where do you get the nails
The tips you used are WAY too small they dont even cover the sides of your nail
As a cosmetologist I cringed while watching this. 😂
The after acrylic nail photo look painful
this is so helpful thanks
doing this now! ill tag my ig when I’m finished! thanks so much for sharing this!
Thank you so much for the tips! 😘
Did anyone try this yet? how did it come out??
I actually thought about this same idea a while ago, and every time I googled "nail tips without acrylic" no one else thought of it? Idk fuck acrylics. Every time I get them done it's not even for me, it's just to look nice. I hate taking them off because it HURTS and my nails are always fucked up in the end. I did this same idea you have and I kept buffing my nail to blend the extension, and in the end I gave up because it fucking hurt. I didn't even think of creating a barrier, so thank you for showing me that little trick. I'm doing this when I get home 😍
where can you buy the acrylic nails?
I've been doing this trick since like 3rd grade
In this video you are just lying.
How do you remove them?
oml last time I was on this channel didn't even have half as much as she does now that was like 2 months ago congrats <3
that what I was thinking
you're literally a genius
I'm a nail tech, and you should EVER let someone use an electric file on your nail! There is no reason to. To get the slight roughness acrylic or gel needs to stick can be achieved with a buffer.
So the tip is supposed to be the level of your nail bed right? If that is what's supposed to happen wouldn't that make the nail weak?
How long does it take to dry out, also can I use it just to make layers to protect my long nails from braking up? Thanks.
I love this because I love the way acrylics look but hate the damage it does to my nail nails.
I've done something similar but without the corn starch. I just used thick clear nail polish like maybe 3 layers. Though i will have to try this. thanks for sharing.
your natural nails is beautiful, why are you doing this weird thing to you?
Do the tips fall off ever? Because I have tips right now and they haven't fallen off, but they aren't cheap either...
How strong are these? How long do they last?
I tend to be ruff with my nails, and hurts when they bend does this happen?
Very clever. Thank you for the tutorial.
Thank you so much!!
Your DIY's 's are my holy grails of diy's in life. You're a diy guru!!!!
Do u get lip fillers

OMG YOU'RE A GENUIS
this was so helpful. I love you
Can you use anything else apart from corn starch?
I wish I would've watched this before I got my nails done 😂
THIS IS SO FUCKING AMAZING GUUURRLRLLL THANK U
she looks like Viki from vampire diares

So do you ever acrylic nails?
thank you so much for posting this. I am a chronic nail biter and am trying to grow them out. I wore acrylics for years and it totally wrecked my nails, especially since I have auto immune issues so they are really weak anyway, and was resisting getting them again. I did this yesterday and it looks really good
I agree with the oversized nail thing
is there a sub for corn starch
How sturdy are the nails cause I don't want them falling off during the week lol
omg thanks ]
what was the white dust you mixed jel somthing? i didnt got exactly what r those?
i rarely subscriber to people, but damn you're creative and initiative af. Hireddd.
Yes you will find this in other places i been doin this since i was 10 but i love yours too
I have only had acrylics twice and they didn't use the drill, but they filed the top of my nail with a hand file. It kinda tickled..
I LOVE THIS
What kind of glue do you use, and where can you buy the nail tips?

what do you edit with?
I have been searching for a video like this thanks so much 👏
made right on my bday.. it passed ehh
I live in Europe, and it looks so cool to do. But what the heck is cornstarch😅😂idk how you write it, sorry lol
which nail glue would you recommend?
anyone who's nail bed hurts after they have been drilled is not having their nails done properly. you are not supposed to be takes 3-4 layers off your just supposed to be removing shine over grown skin that causes lifting and giving the  acrylic something to stick to. people go to these $20-$25 full set shops and wonder y their nails r jacked up well u get what u pay for
can you do more videos like this? I mean to save money like that
love it
How long would it take for the  cornstarch and top coat mix to set
Omg I'm try this💅🏽
Genius Idea
Where can I purchase the clear tips
You could buy acrylic kits with the powder and liquid.
This is finominal
What shade is this nail polish 😻
I love this. can't wait to try
i need that stiletto tutorial
Hi I really want to do this because I have my soccer banquet really soon and I hate going to the nail salon because I have really short bitten nails and the people always get frustrated and blah blah blah. Anyways, my question is do you think I will be able to do this with my nails even though they're really short? It's probably a dumb question since the purpose of these hints is to make your nails longer but yeah. They don't even go to the tips of my fingers like yours so I just figured I would ask lol. Please answer and ilysmmmmmm 💖💖💖
Where was this before I damaged my nails.... )),:
FlowersGirl63 Took the words out my mouth
@alexandrasGirlyTalk does it matter what type of clear coat nail polish one uses?
Where did you get the tips??
hello from kosovo I love every video that u did its amazing and keep it upp 😊
what glue do u use?
0:50 Did I just hear my fandom calling to me?
What kind of glue used to stick the false nail?   P.S : Love your videos !! kisses from Portugal !!
I can't believe you have 1 million subscribers!!! I've been watching you for a very long time
is anyone else having problems with the cornstarch ?
imma do this 👌💅
I don't want to be a hater or anything but one thing that did catch my eye when the nail was done was there was what looked like a lump where the tip meets the actual nail bed, but other than that this is an AMAZING tutorial and I will definitely use it x
This is so original😳😻❤️
I'm dumb, 3 years of buying $10+ files when I could have just washed them....
So many good tips! :)
I usually LOVE your videos (styling curly hair and how to make your lipstick matte in particular), but being a nail technician who regularly uses these tips, there are so many things wrong about this vid!  :(
U are so good beauty guru, I love your triks and your videos are so clear and easy to understand even for strangers like me!! This is the best you could suggest!!  I have a question: don't you put any base or protective coat on your natural nail? ty so much for your videos!!! Your fame is totally deserved and not enough!
lam telling you as advise but most of girls first cut the fake nail and then gloo it on them nails
Woa
do the stiletto nails please :(
wow, impressive. . . .
this is amazing definitely gonna try this.
Van you remove em with nailpolish remover with aceton in it??
Pretty please do a removal tutorial!! 💜
Is there any replacement for cornstarch? ❤️
THE NAILS ARE BEING DAMAGED ONLY IF THE NAIL ARTIST HAD NO IDEA HOW TO WORK GIRL :*
Dude i absolutely love your channel
what is the powder that you used?
What brand of glue do you use? :)
stiletto tut.!!!!!
This is great until the tip pops off (and trust me they pop off ALL THE TIME) and then you have to take off all the polish, re stick it, re buff it, and then re paint it
This is so great omg I am in love 😍
God loves everyone
How would you remove them cause i dont want to risk tearing my nail
it scares me
Do you have to use the cornstarch? I can't find it cause I live in Britain. Btw cute video❤️💖☺️
Why not just grow the damn things out?
You're voice , you sound like Andrea from Andreaschoice 😍😍
I want to an nail salon and when I got acrylic nails and they didn't buff down my nails with a drill, they just lightly ruffled up the top with a nail file and it stayed on for 2 and a half weeks
you have finally  the  million subcribers 😍 for me you are the best youtuber! love💖
I feel weird because one of the reasons why I like Acrylic nails is the unnatural look !! What is the powder did she use?
Do it damage your nail????
the corn starch just goes off .....
This is amazing I cannot wait to try this!
Hey, that's nice ! :O I never had a problem growing out my nails (God seems to have given more nails than height :D). I'll try these one day for sure ! +1
Isn't this just stick on nail extensions though ...? They aren't really acrylic :3 I don't know but it's a good tutorial and really easy to follow ❤️
* Sees The Title. *   SIMPLYNAILOGICAL NOW.
oh my god I sware I thought this was andreaschoice.
I think that if the filing hurts where you get your  acrylics they probably don't do It good because when I do it myself it doesn't hurt at all
Could you link where I could purchase the nail glue and also the nail tips?
These are super pretty!  But what's the difference between using the french tip with the cornstarch top coat, and just using a full coverage nail without needing the topcoat?  It seems like it would be easier to just do that, but does it make a difference?  Just curious
before watching this, I heard about this method so I don't necessarily think you created it but nice job demonstrating.
Accually there are tons of videos just like this so you didn't come up with this method
This is perfect for me!   I've never had fake nails. The thought of ruining my real nails is a turnoff... and depending on my mood, after 2 days I may be over them 😂♊. Great tutorial!👏
That's not good .
What about if your nails are too short?
WOAHHH YOU'RE LIKE THE QUEEN OF LIFE/GIRLY TIPS
Wow! I am allergic to acrylic so I will definitely try this!!!!
AlexandrasGirlyTalk
where did you buy the white tips from @alexandraGirlyTalk
can i do this on my natural nails? not using tips??
I'm just saying but when you do nails like this you should use matte nail polish because when you see the shine you can see the uneven-ness  also... I find it offensive when u say that most acrylics look "too big" because it depends on what you ask for and the nail person... Also a tip if u ever get acrylics I had acrylic nails and I got a simple light colour and when it started to grow out I filed it and painted it with white and then a different colour (I filed it 1 to make it go to my natural nail smoother and so it would stick to the acrylic)
Awesome video!
can you use baby powder?
THIS IS GENIUS
You can give yourself nail fungus by doing that. Lol
first off acrylic do not harm your nails, if they use a drill on your nails get the hell out of that store, find someone who is doing amazing with fake nails instead of the cheap places
I've been waiting for u...missed u...and love this tutorial...totally doin this on my next date...
I have been waiting for so long. It's finally up and so happy. Thank you so much girl!!! You save my life and money 😁 Definetely gonna try this! I'm so happy cause acrylic nails is very expensive in my country and I can't afford it 😂😂 I AM SO HAPPY! I'm gonna tell this all of my friends!!
what nail polish did you use.  I really like the color
what nail polish colour did you apply?
what is this white powder?
were did you get your nail glue from, did it come in the package of nails.
can we get this to 40 likes:)))
normal or supergule?? help!!
How to the hold up in water? I'm a mom and always washing my hands
need to try this one
When other beauty centered YouTube channels do tutorials like this, you ALWAYS need to go out and spend a lot of money, but I actually found this really practical. This is genius!
How do we take them off?
Do a video of how to remove them PLZ
ehm dude I've been doing this for years...
I don't know much about nails, but I watch Nail Career Education and based on what she's said, there's no reason that they should have drilled that person's nails down so far, and it's definitely not supposed to hurt when they file your nails, they were doing it wrong. That was painful just to see.
1. A proper nail salon that will charge an entire days worth of income for one set of acrylic nails will not damage your nail bed. Literally the only filing that needs to be done is enough to remove the natural shine. (Please do not take this as me promoting acrylic nails, just a fact many do not know since 90% of salons over file.)2. Acrylic nails typically last 2-3 weeks between fills/removal, how long do these last?3. Removal with non-acetone or acetone?
This would be really nice for a preteen or tween. So cool!!!!!
This is monumental :D
where can we get the nail tips?
U just got urel a new subscriber. LOVE IT !  so excited to try this ! thanks girl!

Please do a video for stiletto, oval and coffin nails. Maybe just one video where you do one of each.
How long does it take you to do your nails with this method? (I guess someone without practise would need some hours to do it...)
Can you make a removal video for these types of nails?
Can u link the products used ? And where can we get it ?
Is there anything I could use instead of cornstarch?
me 💕 and can you apply the mix of corn starch and nail polish in your whole nails and can you apply an actual color to the cornstarch?❤

Congrats on 1,000,000 subscribers. You really worked hard to get to where you are now. I'm glad to say I was here subscribed to your channel before 1,000,000. Hope you have a good celebration on you great achievement.❤
Thanks   love  this video I refuse to do acrylics  anymore because  they are not only so damaging  but expensive. my natural  nails grow out beautifully  when I can get them too. I might have to try this cause I just recently  cut all my nails down cause  some broke and it looked  funky some short and some long.

CONGRATS ON 1 MILLION
Do you know how to make them a Matte finish instead of glossy? I'd love to see it.. Love your videos by the way.
how do you remove them? pls help someone
omg thank you so much!!
please do the stiletto/ cat claw
Do they break off easily or are they the same as the normal acrylic??? 😝😋Btw I can't wait to try this out I've been trying to find something like this for a while and when you uploaded the video I was so happy!!!😊😄
omg thank you. I honestly love you
Can you post links of all the products you used?? What clear tips and glue and clear nail polish?
How would you take them off?
Getting acrylic nails never hurt me . Maybe they shaved too much off?  because it doesn't hurt from my experiences .
Been waiting for this tutorial for a really long timee!! Love this💗😍
This Was Amazing! Thank You!! ♥
Can you use the ice water drying technique from one of you earlier videos to help these dry?
i got acrylics but i asked the lady not to buff my nails with the buffer thing and to just lightly "prep" them using a nail file buffer like the one you used to file the acrylic down. plus i remove my acrylics at home so i use the nail polish removers i want and the method i prefer. thanks for the diy <3
What nail polish is this and where did you get it?
What's a substitute for cornstarch?
I love these! So much easier and less damaging. So cool that you came up with this, will most definitely be trying these out ❤️
What type of glue did you use?
can you do a removal tutorial also? thanks
YESSS!! im doing this!
what were you mixing the cornstarch with again ?
how do you take them off??
There are so many mind blowing tips, you are amazing!
That is so clever! I also don't like acrylic because its too thick and hard and prefer gel instead. This is a great way to get some of that strength at home with enamel. Btw  when nails are filed for acrylic or gel they are not supposed to be over filed (which unfortunately happens a lot). Using a 240 grit file and GENTLY passing it over the nail bed before you apply the tip and then the corn starch base coat just to take away the nail shine will promote better adherence and can make this last up to two weeks (with proper care). You might just need to add another color coat and of course a top coat for security :-)
Where can you buy these extensions? :) I live in Canada
I don't have any cornstarch and I really want to do this how much does the cornstarch cost and where can I get it. Is there anything else I can use pls
How do you take them off after
You hit 1 mil yaaaaa

Where did U buy the tips? Amazon?
wow. I can't wait to try this method. Thank you!!
omg I have acrylics on rn and its always so painful when they buff them down... last time I actually screamed cuz she just buffed way to much and it hurt SO BAD. I'll definitely be trying this!!!! thanks so much 💖💖💖💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽
Acrylics will not damage your nail as long as you don't go to a chop shop & you don't try to rip them off your nail. 😒
I would love to see how to file the different shapes especially almond shaped!!

Isn't corn starch and clear polish the recipe for the diy matte nail polish?
I love it ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡

I'm really into nail art and have been trying to think of a way to get longer nails with out going to a salon. Seriously could not have been a better tutorial for me! love it :D

Omg what an amazing vid and idea you're so smart
When I got acrylics they looked beautiful when they were on but when they came off my nails were ridiculously damaged, the length they had gotten under the acrylics just came off :/ they were horribly weak for a good month, as well
Does this still work if you have really short nails?💓
I just added u on snap I didn't know u had one 🙌👏👏. im goin to try this cuz I waste so much money gettin my nails done . so thanks for showin 🙌🙌😆😆😆
What brand of clear tips are best?  Also, can you use baking soda instead of corn starch?

Congrats on 1 million subscribers!🎉 I've been watching you since you had 15,000 subscribers and I've loved watching you grow. Love you😙
I have a question. Where youre buying those clear once. I can only find  white nails 😊 thanks if you answer 😊💓 i love u soo much
nice for sharing:)
You have the best hacks. You're actually a genius, I would've never thought to do something like this when I was 13
my nails took almost a whole year to grow back/heal properly after being drilled😭😓
What is the powder you use!! 😊❤
LOVE The nail polish colour!
Absolutely loooooove this <3 Definitely trying it out.
Can you please do a stilleto video? 💙
You guys really don't know that those damaged nails were the results caused by people who don't know how to use drills the right way? Seriously.. Come on... There's a ton of wonderful videos tutorials up there made by people, mostly professionals, who do amazing removing acrylic or gel nails without damage.. Smh... You could have said that this is just another way to get long nails for example. Instead, you prefer to generalize bad removals made ​​by few. 😞
I LOVE this!! i'm allergic to acrylics, and haven't been able to have them for almost a year now, do you think this would be a good idea for me? xx
Can use the same method by putting the false nail at the end of the cuticle?
Fab video! Love the trick.. Nail extensions are so expensive in the market. Im definitely gonna try this! Looovvve it
where can you buy clear tips
Can u do a fill in with these
check out my YouTube channel guys thanks xx
I wanted to know how you remove the nail?
OMG so cool and smart love your Videos gone try it
How do u remove them? Dont frget to make a video a week later when u want to remove them. Dont the tips break ur natural grown tips as well when u try to peel it off? They look beautiful and color is amazing
So you've been doing this since you were 13? You must've been a really smart 13 year old
Can someone give me a link to where I can buy these?
Omg I never thought to use cornstarch and clear polish. This tutorial is amazing!
can u  do a video on how to have a voice like u? :p lol. i like ur voice, :)
I dont know why i like to waist my time just to paint my nails that no one can tell that i painted it
Wait so what exactly did you first use to attach the nail tip to the natural nail?
What job do you have ? You know so much stuff and I thought maybe it's connected somehow with your job ( of course if you have one)
this is amazing!!! how do you remove the tip you applied with nail glue??
I have really wide nails so I can never find fake nails that fit, would those work for my nails?
snapchat squad are u here
Can you use potato starch instead of corn starch??💋
I'm definitely going to be trying this ! Can't wait. Thankyou for sharing X

CAN u make a video when You buff your nails into different shape pleas
just uploaded my first video, would be great if you could check it out, and give some advice:-) :-)
This is awesome! I hate acrylics because of the damage & change of infection.  I haven't had them done in over 10 yrs! My real nails are pretty healthy & do grow out but eventually 1 or 2 will break & I have to cut them all so I love this idea, I'm definitely going to try!!💖
Awwww perfect
BEEN WAITING SINCE FOREVER! Finally!!!! ❤️😌
What glue do you use to stick the fake tips
YOU'RE A GENIOUS. I was thinking to start with acrylic nails but now I'm going to try this THAAAANKSS FOR SAVING MY NAILLS jaja😘😘
This is brilliant!I love getting my nails done but it's SO hard to keep up with them since  I have a 6 month old and  I don't get a ton of time to go get them filled biweekly. Plus, I need to be able to take them off sometimes and that's hard with real acrylics.
Instead of clear polish can you use the base coat with the cornstarch?
Omg yas girl I love it!!! But can I also put the cornstarch on my whole nails and not only on that particulair place? Thankyou! xo
CREATIVE  as always ❤️!!!
I love having my nails done, but I'm sooo anti nail salon! This is so helpful, thank you!
woow they look even better than salon 😍😍😍 .. thaanks honey
Where do you get the fake nails at?
Love that nail color! ♥ I do nail art on my channel, check it out if you want, youtube is the only thing I have right now<3
Are there any alternatives for cornstarch? Also are everyday activities such as cleaning and stuff like that going to ruin your nails? 💖xoxox love your videos! Lots of love from Italy 😊

I was wondering if before you apaly the tips do you have  to file down you natural nail to a shorter length?
please make a video on different ways to take these off💜
Cool Video ! :) Where do you buy the white tips ? I can't find it in stores :/
Every time I try to take of plastic tips of the nail, the glue stay like month after on my nails and it damages it so i dont use tips anymore as well as the acrilics
perfect tutorial. I will definitely give this a try.
meeeee
You should so do a stiletto tutorial!!
Do you know any other alternative to corn starch bc my country doesn't sell it 😭
your a genius I hate acrylic it's so hard to get off anyways this is much much better r
This is literally the best DIY I have ever seen
amazing so creative!
Thank you so much for posting this tutorial😄 I accidentally brought some nail tips and I had no idea how to use them. I watched many tutorials but I never really understood how to use them but your tutorial was so clear and easy.💙
so we apply cornstarch to the actual nail so when we can puff the beginning of the fake one? or to puff the actual nail bed?
My gosh cant wait to do it ! so its just cornstarch and clear nail polish ? Thanks love ypu Alex
what do you mix the cornstarch with??
perfect video ♥♥♥
amazingggg! love u! how your nails look when you take it off?
I so can't wait to try this out thank u for posting this awesome video :) no more spending so much money at the salon

from where did you get the fake nail
Are they hard to write with??
Heeeeyyloooo OMG thanks so much for uploading this :) Is it ok to use like regular nail glue it wont damage ur nail right.. i mean like if its not a branded one?
Doing this for the first time ever. Could u put the name and hopefully the price too of things used in the video in the description box r in another video showing the very basics.
Noooooo pls don't do this to your nails😫 i'm a nailtech and it was a torture to watch this. It's so bad in many ways. Go to a professional and she won't fuck up your nails but with this you can cause sooooo much damage i can't even tell. Just do not ever do this. Never.
IVE LOOKED FOR THIS ALL OVER TH INTERNET THANK YOU SOO MUCH LOVEE YOUU
Congrats on 1 million +AlexandrasGirlyTalk ..huge congratulation ✌👏😍👌😘
Where can I get the clear tips?
Maybe you already answered this question but if you did I didn't hear it's anyway: how do you take them off? Acetone?
You have a million subscribers!!!!!!!
Can I use this if I'm growing out my nails? I bite my nails but I want something over it while I grow them out- but acrylics are too harsh. Can this substitute it? Will my nails grow normal if I use this method ?
amazing!

What could I use instead of corn starch, they don't sell it where I'm from xoxox
This is fantastic!! I most definitely have GOT to try these! God you must have been so creative at 13! Xx
could you use baking soda/powder instead of corn starch ?
tysmm I actually tried this but with a kinda different method so it didnt turn out right so definitely trying this out tysm alexanfra where have you been my whole life and a queation how long does this take you for both hands
Will definitely be trying this! Is there something else you can use instead of corn starch? just wondering
WOW MIND BLOWN
Two questions: what's the total cost? Is it hard to do it with weak hand side???
This video was brilliant!  The video was executed so well, I have no questions!  Definitely trying this!
This is so cool!!! Every time I get my nails done it's like 45 and when one of them falls or chips I can't take them off without damaging my nails or being in extreme pain and this looks like a great alternative!!! I feel like a good tip for beginners is using glitter nail polish cause if you're not great at smoothing the bumps of the cornstarch down the texture of the glitter will hide the texture of the nail underneath. And I'd love to see you do stilettos in this technique!!! That's the shape I go for when I get my nails done!
I'm sooo trying this method! 👌👌👌
This is so creative Alexandra! Thank you so much ❤️
omg i have been doing this as well.. acrylics are really damaging for our nails
I got my acrylics a few weeks ago and I took them off my self and my nails are ruined. Can I do this on weak nails? :)

This video is ERRTHANGG!!!!! I love it! I'm not a super fan of the stiletto nail, but I'd love to see how it's done without looking to big! Thanks!
What glue would you recommend?
does these nails tend to come in between in your daily routine ? I mean sometimes nails can break and mostly this happens to the index finger
Thank you Alexandra I will definitely try this :)
Do we have to use corn starch or can it be anything with a powdered texture such as baby power, baking powder etc ?
me gustaaaaaaa!! I'm definitely going to try this. I'm a college student on a budget and can rarely bring myself to pay for a full set. this is definitely a cost effective option!
I subscribed to your channel 2 days ago and I just wish I found out about it years ago ❤️❤️ I would spend about 10 dollars to get my nails done and there's an easier and safer way hands down your my favourite youtuber x❤️❤️

I have been waiting so long for u to post another video!!! You r incredible and I love u keep making amazing vids
What's that powder?
How you take them off?? Great vid!
CONGRATS ON 1 MILLION!!!!!!
why do people prefer to get acrylics? why don't they just grow out their nails to their desire?
How are you so creative even at age 13? Weren't you nervous when you first created this? Also how would you take it off easily?
This is so helpful! I had the habit of biting my nails (I've gotten completely over it now :)) but my nails don't grow back as fast as I want them to which makes my hands not as feminine looking. I've been thinking of getting my nails done for quite a while now, but this method will save so much time and money. Thank you Alexandra!!!
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!!!!! You are stunning and you are my inspiration!!!! LOVE YOU
Is there anything you can't do with longer nails? How do you take them off? Btw I've been wanting Acrylics but never had money so i'm glad i saw this!
Love!
..... basically the same idea as press on nails. i had them for prom, only difference from this is that it went over your whole nail. no original at all
Yes girl! I love doing my nails and the buffing for acrylics are the reason I don't want to go to the salon! Ima try this!
I hate having acrylics because of how thin they make them
excelent video!! im gonna be rocking this bad boys for my birthday! thank u so much!!♥♥
How do you remove these?
yea my first experience and I didn't like it..maybe I'll do these instead. ..or just work on my natural nails
so there's no acrylic on it??..just corn starch?..and clear nail polish?...BTW love ur videos!!!
What do you use as the glue???
how would you remove these?
I'd be really helpful if you listed everything you used and where you can buy it in the description box, thanks :)!
Is Andreas choice really your sister?
my mom got some
Imma try this👍🏼 thank u
if you want them for a day or two how do you remove them
...or you can just grow out your nails (yes, I understand if your nails don't grow fast or you have a habit of biting them, but that's not what I mean)
Beautiful nails!! Can you apply gel polish to these nails instead of regular polish?
I love this so much, this video is gold. Your videos are always sooo clutch
Stileto tutorial is a must 🤗
Love this but you are not the first person I've seen do this
I need to get my nails done for prom but I ain't got no $😂 so I'll try this out! I love your ideas, they're so helpful
what did you say you mixed the cornstarch with? did you say a clear nail polish?
I honestly love you so much, just discovered this channel with your "how to paint your nails perfectly" video, you are so beautiful and definately subscriber worthy!
how do you remove it?
Omg!!! I CANNOT wait to try this. I'm super guilty of getting my nails done often. But I have 2 full time jobs and it's almost impossible to get them filled regularly. This is so much more convenient! Definitely sharing this with my girls. So excited. Thanks so much for this informative video. Xoxo
Where canyon get all the stuff
Where do you buy the tips?!
question: are they a lot more fragile? like will they fall off easier? YOU LITERALLY SAVED MY BANK ACC. I can't stand acrylics, they're too thick and I usually can't handle them past a week! I need my nails done for prom soon and you might have just saved my life! Thank you!
Omg! I love this!!!
NAME OF NAIL COLOR PLEASE??????!!!! and great video I'm deff. going to try this thanks love!
Before you put on the polish it was diy french manicure! by the way, my cousin is vegan and she loves your recipes :)
what's the book in your vegan video
Congrats on 1M subscirbers.! 💗
I've always been afraid to do this because I don't know how to actually take them off. I had acrylics once and I just ripped them off and it was so painful. To take these off do I soak them in acetone or buff them down or just rip them off? Great video!!
How do you remove this?
The images of post acrylic nails will definitely give me nightmares lol
do you even have a job
me
Actually if done by a good trained professional, filing down the acrylic on your nails should barely break through one of the nail layers
How do you know how far to place the tip when you glue it down because I always have trouble with that?
Do they brake easily
Are they like acrylics or could they just fall off easily?
what is the name of the nail polish? its BEAUTIFUL!💖
Congratulations on 1 Million😄
Great Video. This is what i was looking for , especially on a student budget :) Thank you.What kind of glue are you using?.
Can anyone tell me if shes Andrea's choice sister?
Omg love this 💕👌🏼
Thank you so much for this I always wanted to do my nails myself but it's hard, this is such a game changer!
that wetting the nail file thingy tip to renew it is brilliant!!!!  mine was so old and barely worked anymore!! thanks!!!
I Love u 😻😻😻
I've literally been waiting for this for this for so long!!!! Yesssss thank you!! x
omg i have been waiting so long for someone to do this! Great DIY defiantly will be trying very soon! Question.. what glue do you recommend for the nails, because i  know some glue can be VERY damaging? btw love you <3
omg these are great! already ordered the extensions😏 my mom won't let me get acrylics so I'm so excited!
I love this this video. you are  so creative. 💕💕Could you also possibly link where you got the nail tips  you used?
I loved this
WOW U R MY HERO KMG😽😻💜😩
YOU'RE THE BEST, you've saved my life! i love you.
I've been doing this since I was 13 as well but never thought about the corn starch part. great idea. thanks!
Congrats on a million!!!!!!!!🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉
OMG your a genius!! I'm definitely using this next time I do my nails!!!
You are fucking awesome, thank you for this!!!!!
so cool and i agree much better for nails...ty.
how do you come up with this stuff!? just thinking about the thought process..."hmm lets try corn starch today!" lol
Can you do more tutorials like this and can you please make a  new night time routine 😍😭
Congrats on 1m subscribers ! ♥️♥️♥️
umm so were did you get the tips you started with
Do you have to put the base coat on twice, or can you just do it once?
How do you keep your cuticles so nice?
Love this!! Thank you for sharing!! 💓
as soon as my acrylics fall off im trying this out!
I love acrylics ❤️ But I don't use it very often
Yesssss I've been waiting for this
why are you everything goals
Yeah this all great except your hand will be virtually useless for the duration those nails are on your fingers. How are you going to scratch at things without the tips bending?? The plastic extension is as thin as your real nail. Idk about most people, but I get acrylics because I want nails significantly longer than my natural ones, WITHOUT THE BENDING. If not, why wouldn't you just grow out your real ones. I had really long natural nails for about a year, they just bend when you go to touch things. Acrylic is the way to go for anything medium-long
Congrats on a million!!
Love it!  Where do you get the nails from? :)
Wow this is amazing!! I've been wanting to get off of my acrylics for a while but I'm kind of obsessed with having my nails beautiful, what an amazing, in expensive solution, I must try this! Thank you so much!
So clever! You were a child prodigy lol. Does the polish chip?
I love you.
which glue do you use?☺️
where can we get that nail polish
Where did you buy the clear tips?
how do you take the nails off when you dont want them anymore?
Your videos have completely changed my life, love you girl 💖
My China girl gon be mad
Are they flimsy and how much can you actually do with them :/ I'm horrible at keeping my own nails nice I'm scared I'm going to rip it off or it rips my real nail off if I nick it or anything like that knowing my bad luck lol I'm scared to try it this is an AWESOME idea/creation PS. I have some broken short nails and then some of my nails are pretty long I didn't want to cut them all :/ can I still do it with all different lengths of my real nails? Thank you :D! @AlexandrasGirlyTalk
Where can i get these tips?😘
OMG I love it
I love this!! thank you so much
snapchat brought me here
Thank you so much for this I can't wait to try it!
This is mind blowing ! I've tried so many ways to do my nails at home, but I never thought of cornstarch and clear nail polish !!
Please do a stiletto nail tutorial! That's all I wear and I HAVE to do this to my nails. I had acrylics for about 3-4 years straight and I finally took them off and my nails are so fragile and soft. And of course a full set is $45 and I'm not made of money. I found so many tutorials on how to do your own full set but they all involved acrylic so thank you so much for uploading this video. I've been waiting for it ever since you mentioned it on snapchat! Love your videos, especially the curly hair ones, curly girls gotta stick together ✊🏼 they've been super helpful.
omg I also hate when they make nails look chunky!! this looks so feminine and beautiful. thanks Alexandra for sharing!!
What nail color is this, it's gorgeous?
OMG this is perfect! awesome tips
Pleeeeease do a Stilleto nail shape tutorial! I've been waiting for this ahh.
OMG this is so creative! I'm 13, and I NEVER would of come up with this!!! <3 Love you.
What is the purpose of acrylic nails? I see them almost everywhere but I don't really see the benefit, though. :/
You smarty pants you! ;) thank you for this!
How long does it last ?
this was uploaded right in time! def gna try
I have had acrylic nails for about 5 months and when I got a new set last month (when they take the fake nail off and put on a new nail) I  was TERRIFIED. The damage isn't as bad as some of the pictures she showed but they were still bad. I only suggest getting nails if you KNOW you can  afford it 1-2 times a month. Thinking about stoping this summer and start going natural idk but this video was helpful.  FYI PLEASE do that straw trick you were talking about to make your curls look longer💗💗💗
Definitely want to try this! but where can you find the tips?(:
how do you remove them? is there any solution you can put your nails in? or do u just wait till they chip off? !!!!!?
Me Thank you so much for this I will definetly be trying  this method.
YOU ARE THE REAL BEAUTY GURU ON YOUTUBE 💖 I seriously like your content so so so much, until now I haven't seen something on your channel that someone else did

Any Panic! fans here's?

I have a a lot of experience in accrilc and nails and soon I will be taking my nail course to get officially certified. She dose not understand that the thick and chuck let nails are because of the accrilc. If you ever put tips on your nails make sure that the tip fits from side wall to side wall. Also the top is completely covering the tip of your natural nail.(an example of doing this incorrectly is on her thumb)
Great idea but I'll be scared to let my nails be that long considering that there is no harden layer protecting the nail bed and the tip. It's very easy for the tip to break and it'll hurt a lot. As a nail tech I think if you want to avoid acrylic nails and just want a week worth of extension to your natural nails, then just get the stuck on nails where you apply the whole plastic nails on top of your natural nails. Probably gonna save you more time.
did u cut ur nails????
how do you remove those?
Do they fall off easily? Cause i can be rough with my nails sometimes and i don't want them to fall off and have to  constantly put a new nail on.
I wanted to know like how would you take them off? When they're fully grown out though... Because i don't wanna like rip it off in a way it'll damage my nail. Great video by the way! This saved my life!!
I love this video so much!!Question: When removing the nails, do I use nail polish remover or is there another way? That's maybe a bit quicker?
which were the products you used instead of the acrylic? loved this video so much definitely I'm gonna try this❤💕✨
@Alexandrasgirlytalk I have a question, could you use that corn starch and nail polish mix on its own without using tips? I have natural long nails and thought maybe this mix would harden them. Love you videos btw 😙
This is genius! I have been wanting to get my acrylics done for sooo long but kept putting it off bc of the damage it does, ur amazing girl! :-)
Hi, I was just wondering what brand/type of glue you used? Love your videos btw :)
omg gotta try this ♡
From snapchat
Please do a stiletto nails look
You save my life👏
Can you use baking soda as a replacement for the cornstarch?
what is your favorite nail polish color ?
Can you do a video on what it's like being vegan or do you already have a video like that?
i dont know about your country. but here in sweden, a professionall nailartist never buff down the acrylics. never! dont know what they are using, but they never buff down the acrylics
I've been waiting so kin for this video 😭😭😭
love it wooooow
OMG YEAASSSSSS
Omg this is amazing! I hope this video gets featured everywhere on the Internet! Snap fam saw this first!😊
This is really helpful since I can't get my nails done or it'll ruin them.
Last time I got acrylics the lady filled my nails so hard she cut the side of my nails TWICE! Luckily I didn't get an infection but defiantly not going back😒😁
I've been waiting forever for this<3 so excited to try this, love you!
OMG YAYAYAY you don't know how long I've been waiting for this video❤️

congrates on 1 million!!!
congrats on one million subs! 💖
Yay! I can start doing my nail more, and they will actually look healthier  after wards. By the way! I love your channel, how to actually love my natural curly sometimes frizzy hair. By any cance can you make life hacks for frizze hair sometime soon?
Most helpful nail tutorial I've seen!
Doing your left hand must've been hard....I always have trouble😅😅
1, those nails are damaged from untrained nail techs and you can tell the acrylics were ripped off rather than soaked off 2, your nail tech should NOT be hurting you. The drill should NEVER hurt. IF IT HURTS ,LEAVE!  3, ACRYLICS are not bad if they are put on correctly.   4, there is no need for your nail tech to drill or file your natural nail bed for acrylic. if they're doing that they may be using MMA monomer and it is dental acrylic and deemed unsafe for salon use. Make sure they are using EMA. If there's a language barrier it may be better to go somewhere else.   5, cheaper is not always better when it comes to your nails.
girl how do u come up wih this stuff
Ahh I've been waiting for so long and the vid came out great love you😘❤️👑 and Please do a stiletto tutorial
Yessssss love this! Thank you.
thanks for making this video so much...I needed a video like this since I love doing my nails a lot but recently they have been breaking and chipping  off because of all the damage.  I will defiantly try this!! thanks so much
Is there anything you could use in place of the cornstarch
This was frigen AWESOME i can't believe how good they looked I was expecting ATLEAST one bump but they were seamless!! Awesome awesome job!! You nailed it!! Bravo 👏🏻 can't wait to try it out!! How much corn starch are you mixing in is my only question?? Just until it's like thick???

Where did u get your tips from like what brand and also the glue
Girl thank you! Love your videos!
I love this
Omg how cool
where can u buy the nail tips?
Ahh so beautiful keep the vids coming
Do you fill them in when they grow out or do you have to start all over? If so can you do a video on how you fill them in as well! Thank you!
I'm always scared to get some sort of infection since not all salons clean their tools properly so I stopped getting acrylic plus my nails grow fast and thick but after this tutorial OMG! Youre making me an addict lol
i really want to try this out but im so impatient when it comes to drying my nails
loving this!
Love this idea! question : did you use a top coat after or is it not needed?
Omg 1 million subs
Will they easily snap off when you're washing your hair?

Loved this! I am going for my professional 'fill' tomorrow and this makes me want to do my own nails.  Do you remove them with just acetone?  Do you soak or rub or ???  Thanks! ♥ Elle
