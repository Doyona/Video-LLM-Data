simplicity @ its bst. thanks
How  simple  I like it
Which brand of garam masala is good to go
Super tasty  and healthy. 👍
Wow...such a simple recipe. You explained it so well.
Really REALLY disappointing. The coconut never cooked and remained chewy and fibrous, and the flavour was lacking. I'm not surprised though as the spice quantities weren't stated, so had to be guessed. Sorry, but it was awful
How much coconut? How many garlic cloves? Etc.  Quantities would have been helpful
Many thanks for this dish
I want to make it for 20 people, so plz tell me how much quantity will it take?
So spicy recipe ma'm
Vow awesome will surely give e it a try 😎
Can we add dry coconut
Lovely recipe like you😘 Thanks mam for sharing with us
Can this be done in cooker?
I love your recipe
Interesting ❤️
Super recipe I will do it and give you a  comment about the dish  thanks for sharing your cooking recipes with us

Hi ruchi i love your vedios
Nice recipe Ruchi ji
You are one of the most beautiful chief in the world
Best recipe of handi ever on YT! Best part is no sauteeing and the flavour is so different and tasty!
Thank you Ruchi. My partner who is Brit says it tastes a bit like korma. We loved it. Although I added a bit much water so it wasn't as thick and used Maggi Coconut Powder.
aap koi recipi hindi m ni btati kya adhi smjh hi ni ati h
Can u please tell me the amout of coriander and cumin seed powder
i have a clay pot in my home
It turns yummy but took too long for vegetables fully cooked and evaporate whole water.
Prepared it the same way but without coconut.. it didn't turn out good at all.. very disappointed 😏
Hi Ruchi I tried it. It was just awesome. Taste was rich and different from monotonous pyaaz tamatar gravy. I also added panner in that and my husband just loved it. Thanks for sharing this.

I made it so easy and taste great!
Hi Ruchi!!  I am cooking the very recipe you just showed! Hope my husband likes it.  Thanks for this 🙂

Hi Ruchi..........I am back with my experience for veg handi, I tried it.........it was gud so far but I did few mistakes ......probably pour some extra water and then my veg got a bit mushy..........also tried with dessicated coconut................but taste was nice...........next time I will try the original ingredients and less water..........very different taste and easy to cook..... thanks a lot...........:))
Made this for Christmas tasted DELICIOUS 😁
