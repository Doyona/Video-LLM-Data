Missing them so much they were my childhood

Is no one gonna be impressed that Rob made a reasonable amount of spaghetti? I always make WAY too much…
Ahh why did u have weed and hahahah let’s pretend that we didn’t see that 😱😨😰
HE SWEARS A 0:13🙄🙄🙄
I adore rewatching these. They make me happy lol These videos are just always a good time
2022??
Sheldon cooper would love those spaghetti hot dogs
Can you do a Geod cake? Like with Corinne?
Hot doggity
In the realm of "things that sound bad when you say them" in this video, "pipe in the cream" was probably more tolerable than the attempts at humor.
7PM SHARP WE EAT NOODLE WEENIE DOGS!!!
Do more man vs din
those are  noodle  weenie  dawgs
Ok but mans made noodle weenie dogs BEFORE noodle weenie dogs
That isn't cheddar 😂😂😂
Noodle Winnie dogs

TikTok bought me here
This video has hardcore rick from rick and morty energy
Commenting prior to having watched the video: I actually made these once. it is a very time consuming process to make enough for a family of 4 (at least, a family of 4 with 2 teens, one being a boy)
We all fucking love you Rob!! Continuing support in your condition.   Please keep positive for yourself, Corrine and is the audience.
Everyone's talking about the bag of weed and how everyone isn't acknowledging it   Because it's weed, and weed is awesome
No thanks rob, I'm too younge to drink
do this again but with meatballs
Everyone's talking about the weed and him drinking that much vodka but I'm just concerned that he said cheerio at 5:35
rob sounds constipated im sorry i had too😂
IM ONLY SIXTEEN YOU MONSTER ( 1:35 )
That’s not weed it Oregon
0:59 no wonder Rob has crazy food ideas
Being from Cincinnati... I just want to use the spaghetti hot dogs with Skyline chili
using doritos as crumb is a genius idea
You are awesome
It’s not weed, it’s oregano.
September 2019 people here???
How TF is this 3 years old already!?
after what happened recently, i love to come to rob’s old videos and watching every single second of the video and ads. stay strong rob & corinne.
Hello I’m a time traveler from 2019 and you will get a dinosaur
RIP man vs din. He’s on disability
Who else likes the fact that rob "virtually feeds" us. 😂
How is nobody talking about how Rob actually did something right
Anyone else rewatching ancient threadbanger vids in the wake of Rob cheating the Grim Reaper? No? Just me?
Did anyone else just fall down a threadbanger hole after watching the video of him almost dying
To the 1.7 thousand people who disliked this gfy
Rewatching old videos, it’s kinda comforting after seeing Rob so sick.
Damn that's a lot
I like the progressive level of drunk
Lol, loved the bag of weed at 0:59
Dogetty...
Anybody else dying while he squeezed out the churro batter out of the piping bag
that bag of weed I-
NEW SUB
You should make a man vs Corrine vs pin and do a clear pumpkin pie
NEW SERIES IDEA, *clears throat* “ Rob gets drunk while cooking!” What cha think?
That bag of weed tho
Please do a diy dreamcatcher against each other!!!
Why didn’t he just put them in the fridge when they were on the pan so it wouldn’t be so hard to get out of the tube
Glad this came up in my recommended (sorry late to the show) I have a new cooker coming next week and i'm already sich of sandwiches and microwave meals and first thing i want to make is the spaghetti dogs!

Rob Vs disability. Find a local disabled YouTuber with a sense of humour and get them to put you through what it's like being in their shoes. Or wheelchair. Or whatever

1:09 "you want two shots of vodka"
U can just buy your own Oreo Cheerio
Do you guys smoke weed or was that weed
Make a new series where u try to make pins as quiet as possible. Watch this for an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXLiPk2uIY
For the spaghetti dogs, instead of adding tomato sauce, just put butter on it. 8/10 (cuz it's not that healthy but it's delicious XD) My mom used to make these all the time.
Who saw him pick up a bag of weed?
DFTBA

Did u just assume my age?? Oi I'm in third grade
I love the culinary genus part
When he said try it a bunch of times it reminded me of Bill nye
Anyone else hate the taste and texture of hot dogs I only eat them burnt
Do more shot glasses
Should Corinne let him in the kitchen he is half drunk and even when he isn't drunk he hurts himself lol

I've watched this video so many times but never noticed the bag of weed until now.....😂
Tastes like air
I dare you to make a drink without alcohol, plzzz
Wait what Rob is using instructions???
This needs to be Thredbanged.  https://youtu.be/YrQVYEb6hcc Rob might die though
Rob: "here try some" *sipping noises* IM TOO YOUNG FOR THIS
'Din' means "A loud unpleasant, or prolonged noise"
In my family there was cheese on them and we called them cheesy spiders
Rob got real drunk in the cid
It pisses me off when people are doing an oreo cake or baked good and they don't seperate the cookie from the creme, especially when the crumbled bits should be dry.
Who else was waiting for rob to cut the sh*t out of his fingers?
Can you please do skull shaped sugar cubessss
spagoot dogs
rob:hey u want some? me:*drinks it*wow  rob:tastes good right me:fuck no
I'm not legal. Not even where I live xD (the legal drinkin age here is 18 but nobody takes it seriously)

I think I'm a genius! Instead of hotdogs use meatballs and you can have spaghetti stuff meatballs!
I love how he just pulled out some fucking weed like it was nothing.
Pro tip from a Spanish person who doesn't get the way americans do churros: original churros don't have eggs in them. Search for a proper recipe and you don't even have to pay extra to get vegan churros if you are vegan, because original churros don't have any animal products in them. It's just flour and water guys.
If Rob didn't swear as much, he would be just like my uncle.
Hey who wants to try some of my maggot dogs!?!?
I love when he actually tries
1:00 JEEZUM BUD
we miss you pin o meter
rob you're giving me fucking ideas ;-;
Rob is so drunk in this episode he actually read directions for the Doritos nachos... And then he proceeded to not read the directions on the Oreo churros. Oh Rob.

At 4:44 did anyone else notice the dough FALLING OUT THE BAG?
Din din!?ha!
It's so funny at 3:35

DIY weed
Rob.. They're cinnamon bun churros. You essentially just made a normal churro.
Who did the spaghetti hotdogs?!
My mom did these like 3 years ago
I miss Pin o Meter ;-:
For people wanting to know how to use piping bags the best way to fill them is to put the bag into a tall glass and fold it over the lip of the glass so it stays open and upright. you also should put in about half as much as rob did and then twist it shut. Then hold one hand over the back of it to stop it from untwisting.
What's glutany?

That bag was filled with broccoli even though i have no doubt he smokes
He's there eating his hot dog dinner and I'm here eating a slice of bread👍🏻

I trick to filling up piping bags is if you get a jug, put the bag in the jug and gold the edges of the bag over the edge of the jug. That way it keeps the bag solid and open. Also do you know how to fucking pipe. You push the mixture until it's almost out then twist the bad where there is no mixture left so when you pipe it, it doesn't just move down. You also pipe it from the bottom of the mixture.
My mum used to make this all the time when I was a kid. I didn't even realise it was a thing until now

I mess up in cooking every time :c I messed up in trying to make fried green beans or whatever but I ended up burning them, pizza rolls and thy were as hard as before I cooked them and not to mention the color...pretty much looked like charcoal to me, and then I tried to make instant lasagna....I'm not going to even go there :I I messed up the heating thingy...I barely even know how to turn on a oven....which is why I messed up the lasagna...But this seems really good o3o something that I might actually be able to make without burning XD Well knowing me I dont know about that XD

Hai
but first, he smoked that bag of weed for scientific purposes
Rob is defiantly on drugs
Can you drink more "Adult Kool-aid" or "Adult Lemonaid" during most of your videos? Again, I said MOST. Don't be drunk while messing with knives or chicken wire, etc. (or needles, because finding them on the streets behind a dumpster is A+)
0:59 was that real weed tho

THE WEED BAD😭😂😂😂😂😂😂

An easy way to fill a piping bag is to set the tip at the bottom of a pint glass and fold the part that sticks out over the rim. Then you can fill it without it falling over and even wipe the spatula on the bag covered rim to make filling the bag a breeze.
Actually it's pretty easy   to squeeze out the churrio dough if you have muscle Rob......

I've never been on Pinterest, but seeing these 4 things...I can tell it's not something I'd enjoy.  Seriously, what fucking idiot finds any of these a "good" idea?  Stuffed Doritos: Better idea, if you like doritos and want to use them in cooking, make Mozz Sticks and use Doritos as the breadcrumbs.  Spaghetti Hotdogs (???): Yeah, spend your time jabbing dry spaghetti through hotdogs...Or you could cut up a hotdog into your spaghetti.  Oreo Churros: Chocolate Churro Batter with buttercream...Wow...original.  The "Adult" Capri-Sun: "Why no Bob, I'm not using a glass...I'm drinking out of a bag! Because I'm a fucking moron!"
He is so fucking drunk

Make nacho chicken all you need is chicken,crushed nacho chips flour and eggs. Then you just cook them on the pan until their crispy
Hey try those ideas 1-make a pizza , once you are done don't bake it but gold it in half and cover the top with a little bit of smashed eggs to make crispy when you bake them it's awesome 2-try boiling some hotdogs and broccoli with your ramen noodles they make a fantastic side 3-here is a recipe for you pretty sure you haven't tried it -cooked ground beef -chopped onions -chopped green peppers -salt and pepper (other seasonings depending on your taste) -tomato paste -ketchup -hot sauce (optional) Keep it on low-medium heat lift when you think it's ready take a bun fill it with that awesomeness and then put that "sandwich" in a waffle iron or something similar just to make the bun crispy,enjoy Thank me later

I've made an experimental turkey for thanksgiving every year.They  have been really fun. So far I have made delightful successes in turkey science. To mention a  few; a fireball turkey with jalapeños fried or roasted it then covered it in hot wing sauce. I've done a pesto turkey with pesto under the skin and on top and stuffed it with herbs and pine nut stuffing. I've made a turkey covered and stuffed with bacon; which everyone liked so much that now I make a bacon turkey and then an experimental one So i challenge you two to maybe try one that I've done and create one on your own. I understand you may want to wait till Thanksgiving to try it, but my fiance says it is always season for a bacon turkey.

You want to know who is responsible for the fact that the rich people become even more rich while most people become poorer? The answer is simple: The Rotarians are responsible for this! This Organisation named Rotary pretends to be charitable, but that's a lie. All rich and mighty people all over this world are in this organisation (Obama, Merkel, Gates etc.). Just google and see what you will find.
Man vs buzzfeed I mean they post some weird things.

I got excited for a second. Spaghetti and hotdogs are amazing, but that's not how you make them, I mean sure shoving the spaghetti through pis cool, but you got add some tomato soup, Worcester sauce and mustard, and bake the whole thing. Then you'll have some good eats!
Does Corinne know your stealing her  show?
Any recipe would be great ...as long as there's alcohol involved !

Dear Rob,  please do this pin https://youtu.be/Rp2Pm1bTTwc.  Its Agor cake with a strawberry in the middle.

Straight guys should't attempt to make -baked- fried goods...  First you fold the pastry bag in half to avoid messes when filling it up. Second you make sure the batter goes all the way to the tip of the bag and the back side is closed/tied/folded before you squeeze it out. Third you need to know the CORRECT TEMPERATURE and keep it stable while you do anything with flower, or in other words your oil was too hot.
wtf! lmao! hahaha so funny really hotdog spaghetti geez!

Must have been a pain to edit out all the profanity
thanks for this seven minute long video, i was having trouble sticking spaghetti though cut up hot dogs and boiling it
If you substitute the hotdogs with sausage , it would probably be way better
I loved it
The name makes me want to punch your face... But the show and concept itself is pretty entertaining.
Omg do spaghetti tacos next!! They're from Icarly and I always wondered if they tasted good
i fucking dies when he took the weed bag out and then just put it back down as if nothing happened

More drunk Rob please.
Hey Rob, the spaghetti hot dog thing is a good idea, but if you want to make it great, skip the spaghetti sauce and top it with chili and shredded cheddar cheese instead! Yup, chili cheese spaghetti is awesome, and you need to try it. Top it with chopped onions and pickled jalapenos for the ultimate excellence.
So instead of waiting for blood, we are waiting for a heart attack. I'm in!

Yessa! Loved it! Now, do one of those chocolate melting balls. Underneath it will be like ice cream And brownies, then the round chocolate ball goes on top and when serving it you pour hot liquid ontop the ball to melt it down, revealing the underneath goodies!
Great new show rob ! Don't know how you can screw these up but I'm sure your find a way !
It probably would have been easier to pipe the churros then freeze them for 30 mins and then fry them after that. Just in case you make them again or for anyone making these! :)

When you picked up the green 😂
Make new food
Rob yer drunk
MAKE ROCK CANDYYYYY!!!
This is actually sinning oh my god
you can do something else cool with that adult capri sun thing.. instead of ice just add water, then vodka and fruit juice or whatever cocktail stuff you want to make.. and then pop it in the freezer. when it's frozen, take it out and cut a hole/line out of one of the bottom corners and you have a little popsicle thing that is great on a hot day. as it melts you just push more of it out. you can do that with any juice in fact. but i've found you want to use a good bit more sugar or juice concentrate than you would for if you were just drinking it. it makes it WAY better
omg i just got so drunk yesterday and flooded my bathroom so seeing your drink I want to take a sip too but the thought of drunkeness makes me sick atm >.<
Can you make potato roses? This show is very nice :)  https://www.pinterest.com/pin/557672366332445020/

you should make a series called man vs gin and show us how to make Pinterest cocktails.
I made cheese-stuffed Doritos before and they came out awesome!
(Rob made an intro) "oh nooo food! better just leave the cooking and knife wielding to Corrine." (at the end of the video) "OKAY OKAY you can cook" Love it. Do more of it. Now let me make those churreos for munchies.

Are you going to be making a drink with everyone of these episodes too?
In the Philippines, and I have no idea how it became a thing, but our Spaghetti is already served with hotdogs in them. No joke. Our McDonald does it. House moms making pasta for a kids birthday does it. Hotdog pasta is woven in our culture.

This is amazing!
lmao this vid would be better if there werent all these unnecessary f bombs everywhere like what are you trying to emphasize by saying fuck like every sentence time to grow the hell up now
#mydrunkkitchen
That bit when you accidentally/purposely put the weed nugget bag in the video instead of the empty one.... That gave me life :'D
Try This http://www.thesitsgirls.com/food/frozen-hot-chocolate-recipe/
okay so this might sound crazy...but how about you subsidise your pin vids with actual diy videos... yeah i know you don't want to hear from long-term thread heads that we miss the old structure of the show, because i have to say i love man vs pin and all the rest. but i enjoyed it a lot more at the start when they were interesting pins and you were making a genuine effort to complete them! the one i've enjoyed most recently was the ottoman tire because it looked awesome when you were done! i know that these DIY channels have become a bit of a joke on YT because its more about the personalities than the DIYs, but its definitely more interesting to watch good DIYs with a fun personality than crap ones like galaxy toothpaste or glitter bowls :/ remember the shadow chandelier? or the teacup lamp? they was awesome. and you and corrine used to do sick DIYs on this channel all the time. good diys are all over the internet (and pinterest) and you don't need to question whether they will work for it to be fun to watch. man vs pin was amazing but as you've said yourself you've practically done all the questionable pins so you've lost ideas! i don't mind this new idea of testing cooking pins either btw but i'm just making an additional suggestion.   p.s. swear all you fucking want. i don't really understand why young children are lecturing you on your swearing...especially when you bleep it out anyway? you do you.
Please please do Natala chocolate cupcakes
Not octopuses

I remember that hot dog spaghetti recipe from /ages/ ago. I'm pretty sure I've seen it in a "fun with kids" special edition of Taste of Home  in the mid-90's lol When I was a kid I'd nag my mom to let me make hot dog spaghetti and hot dog octopuses -- hot dog spaghetti especially tasted great with cheese sauce :D

He should do more drunk shows. I think he does better
your better at cooking than at attempting to do pinterest ideas
"I cooked them until they were cooked" Okay, I think Rob + A lot of Vodka are not a good combination...
I did NOT want to watch him drink all that alcohol he can't hold his liquor
Buzzfeed man.vs.buzzfeed (food) also you remind me of shaggy
what's more impressive is that he managed to do all of the recipes without bleeding or half dying while drunk as shit
how coincidental I ate spaghetti for dinner today. but ew not hot dog spaghetti 😂😂
god damn it it's 1:30 in the morning and now I'm hungry and craving some god damn mac and cheese. why mac and cheese? because we just bought some today and i fucking love mac and cheese.

Dear Robinne (Ship name) I want to thank you guys. You guys inspired me to be myself and not give a flying fuck about what anyone thought. Making a YT channel has been something on my mind for years now, and seeing you two do it gave me the courage to do the same. I'll be making videos starting in August on my channel Chweezers. Hopefully by then I'll have the proper equipment or at least a decent camera. Thank you.  -Best Regards,  Chris.

First man vs. din and this far into the series he already go drunk😂
COLORFUL SPAGITTE
Boo boop
Hahaha this was great! Although... note to Rob... You made what is called a choux pastry, which is what's used for making churros... So you did that right! Good work! But as you noticed... one of the main ingredients in a choux (pronounced "shoe) pastry, is BUTTER. When butter gets cold, it gets hard. So don't let it cool down so much next time :) Other than that, good work man! I really want to try out your Capri Sun... it's 10am here in Australia, and it's looking to be a damn good day if that gets involved!
Try this "S'more Crack Dip" But add real crack  https://www.pinterest.com/pin/363665738641843568/ Or White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake Greek Yogurt Popsicles https://www.pinterest.com/pin/AUr44bsvH6UBwxooWbyYJG1tsIaOzCCBh_aJ-BXX26Ley2EHQZ-RDbs/
You can buy cheese stuffed Doritos at Wal-Mart.

You could have just made three separate videos lol no one would have complained. A+ for effort though. now time to go get your arteries checked lol
someone should legit just open up a restaurant that only makes food from pintrest. And the customers should use a tablet as a menu and anything edible on there, the chefs make.

+ThreadBanger you are amazing rob you are so funny and have a great sense of humor which a lot of people don't get and I love this episode I've watched it 3 times in a row and corinne is funny and and awesome to. also It would mean the world to me if you gave me a shout out and getting a gold play button but I don't think you can make the second thing  happen but honestly even responding to this would be one of the best things to ever happen to me and If you choose not too I totally respect that decision  because I will still get to watch these videos and I will be thankful that   you  make me laugh so much

Watermelon fruit grill http://pin.it/dn5pJSb
THE BAG OMG
Brilliant first video for your new channel.  The whole show would make a full outdoor party. I'm imagining a make your own adult Capri Sun drink buffet, with different fruits, flavorings, and alcohols.  Along with a cooler filled with ice, and varying sizes of freezer (sturdier) Ziploc bags. Same with the hot dog spaghetti, warmed via crockpot or canned heat.  An array of herbs (LOL), cheeses, and sauces. The Cheesy Doritos I'll make with different cheeses & chips. The Oreo churros look too hard.  I'll use the crescent roll biscuits without curving them, and pipe in frosting or cheesecake mix. I love this!
ROB YOU GAVE THOUSANDS OF KIDS ALCHOL!! I shouldn't be watching you but oh well
More
My notifications went off and it scared the shit out of me 🙃🔫

Youre just making me hungry
yay you actually did something completely right
Hey Rob
Man vs slim. Lose some weight from all that cheese.
who noticed the weed
Love it
I wonder if you could do spaghetti and hotdog thing with spaghetti and meatballs. Although I guess boiled meatball isn't as appetising as hotdog - because, hotdogs are just made with top quality ingredients :D  I do like that they make it a whole lot easier to eat spaghetti.
As we see hear, a rare sighting of Rob (sort of) successfully accomplishing pins.
I'm hungry rn
This is so cool
Papyrus and my fav food is finally a combination
make grilled cheese rolls and cinnamon roll shots
Plz try this hot Coco pin:  http://lilluna.com/mint-hot-cocoa/

you should do episodes where you take random foods and then put whiskey on them or something. see how many pieces of the food you can take before you get drunk xD random thought
You should make some pinwheels
this video looks so delicious....so hungry XDD
You should make more!
I find it odd to watch ppl eat, even if it's very satisfying 😂😂
Finally
