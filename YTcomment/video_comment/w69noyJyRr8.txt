Hi guys! You've been waiting patiently for this video after I teased you over on Instagram (ha!). So I'm happy to finally share it with you today. Make sure to check out the full blog post for more tips on making this recipe as well. Happy zucchini fry eating! xo - Lisa
How long cheese last in fridge  or freezer
You are on my point. Thank you. I have almost ALL all that you have in your video. I’m so happy. Thank you.
Yes all good. I’ll try this recipe. No matter what, this recipe seems more better than French fries which my child loves.  So I’ll try and look up the-best case scenario. Thank you.
Thanks for the parmesan update.
Can we have the degrees in the description please updated?
❤❤❤❤
Was looking for a simple recipe like this. Thanks!
❤
*I love that I can enjoy fries guilt-free, knowing that they're packed with nutrients.*
How much time in the air fryer
Looks so yummy!!
ARE you that desperate?
I need to be at low fodmap diet and my garden is occupied by zucchini
Looks great. I'm trying thistomorrow looks doable for stroke people like me... not much cutting..and still healthy...I think k I can manage the grating...if not I have a friend willing to help
Yummy!!! 🥰❤️🎶
Can you do an updated version using an air fryer?? 😍
Yummy I love zucchini ❤
Zucchini naturally gives out water, try gently salting it and leaving for some time, then pad dry... Wondering, wouldn't it make itself crispier?)) 😉
Really good and simply healthy
They look sooo good! Thanx for the recipe.
Did you know that there are handy devices that are used for mixing ingredients without using your fingers?  They are called spoons and forks.
Zucchini fries very healthy
what is the oven tempreture? 350? 375? or 400?
I love this recipe!! Subscribried
Almond flour is low carb. When you started saying that, I thought you were going to say regular flour.
What a nice hunk of cheese and holy cow spice drawer!  Going to make these.
Looooooved it! I will definitely try it!! 💚
What's the baking temperature?
im confused why she said you can use almond flour when you’re not concerned about being low carb..isnt almond flour keto approved?
Black is a fantastic color on you!  Also, you are sooooo talented. Everything I’ve made from your recipes have tasted amazing
Where do you purchase the fresh parmesan?
YUMMY LOVE IT!!!
This recipe.looks easy to make and delicious. Thank you so much!
Delicious 😋 🙏🏼
I made these and also made a zucchini casserole and used the sauce on the casserole, it was amazing! :)
The aoli is so good!
Excellent!!!  Thank you.  I just found you; good quality video without the nonsense so I immediately respect you!  Perfect for my special needs daughter and me!!!
Hopefully you can put on subtitles! Thanks!
I’m gonna try this. Would have been great to know what temperature to bake them!
How many calories?
I don't eat Egg. what is the best replacement ?
Naw she 🐐 ed😧🔥🔥🔥
Mine stuck to the pan even though I used parchment paper I think I should’ve greased mine a bit.
These look delicious! Excited to make them! I’m so grateful to have found your channel recently. I haven’t had an interest in cooking in a number of years but your videoed make it all seem simple, fun, and the best part - healthy! I’ve made two of your recipes this week and I’m excited to make many more!
Awesome video...tried it today...and it was amazing... never thought zucchini would be so tasty 🔥... Thanks a Lot
Thank you for this recipe! Delicious! My daughter at college started making them too and now loves zucchini! Yay!!
Thank you 😊 they were delicious. I couldn’t stop eating them. 😋😍
If you ask me, keto is not for most people. It is just really tough to follow and you feel exhausted. But the Agoge diet on the other hand feels great ,and it works too
If you want to lose fat, I recommend trying the Agoge diet. I lost lots of fat and felt great all the way.
I really love your channel and all your great receipts! ☺️👏🏻
Thank you!!.. I'm trying this week
I tried these tonight and they were delicious! Thank you!
thanks!
I saw that spice drawer and yelped. Lovely!
Does ALL pregrated cheese have unhealthy additives and cheaper cheese as you described about pre-grated  parmesan cheese?
great job! unfortunately i'm on a diet... boo hoo
Thank u for ur tips mine where coming out floppy or the mixing would cling to the chips
Mine alway come out floppy when I tried frying and they are squishy
Do you have any air fryer recipes?
Picked up a HUGE zucchini at the farmers market today. I only had the grated parm but I was very happy with the outcome! A little soggy still but the taste, with my improvised dip, was delicious! Thanks for your recipe!
These were a hit!  Thanks!
Loved this video for the simple and delicious way to make zucchini fries, but was totally amazed at your spice drawer! I was so impressed that I had to show my husband. He was equally impressed!
Did I miss what temperature to set the oven on?
This looks delish !!
I love your recipes and cooking from scratch,  however I am allergic to eggs and chicken. I would love to eat a hard boiled egg again.. it’s a dream of mine! I am always looking for true and tried egg alternatives for the same great dish!   Love all the tips! I sooo wish I could eat this!
Temperature of the oven for use beginners???
Please turn off the background music  😳
I struggled with the keto diet too much, I just felt exhausted. We are supposed to enjoy the food we eat and with the keto diet that's close to impossible. That's why I tried the Agoge diet and it works great.
I Thank you for  that recipe  I will  try  them I also like the  smoothie  I do  have a  question  about  one of them  how  can I  talk to you  lisa. to get a  answer
Take a shot every time she says zucchini
Nice I will try these zucchini fries sound like a lot of fun. As well as healthy and not fattening. Gluten free is awsome love it.
Say zucchini one more time!
Looks good make these into chips store
so the whole recipe is 172 calories or it is only one chip
hey, i can’t eat dairy that tastes like dairy (got intoxicated once) could i use bread crumbs
Come on zuchini  GROW!
how to do this without cheese? :(
I don’t do Instagram so thank you for using you tube.  Love your recipes. Planted zucchini in my garden this year, for first time , so great to see the various ways to use
could you use fresh green beans from the garden.. or would they become to limp?? trying to find more to do with this recipe ... Love it so much.
Hi!! First of all thanks for your recipes. They’re delicious, I love them all! Maybe you have a recipe of spinach cream soup which is tasty and also keto-friendly , if you do, please could you put it out on this channel? Thanks and kind regards!
Trying these out tonight !
I'm vegan so i substituted hemp seeds for parm and flax egg. Turned out delicious
Great tip about breading stuffs 👍
Parmashan?
How many calories?!!
Smoking hot lady
Hi beautiful where did you get your measuring spoons?
Great!! Simple and efficient helpful process-love that ++ they look delish
Try it with greek tzatziki ...they are awesome
You CAN eat these leftover!!  I put them into a pan and covered with a lid, heated pan to medium and after 5 minutes they were like fresh!!  Excellent!
All I heard the whole time was cheese cheese cheese cheese😂
wao amazing recipe , infact i was looking a good snack recipe for my mom, she is heart patient , thanks for sharing
I am not a big fan of zucchini. But I just finished a whole zucchini first time ever in my life. This recipe is amazing!
tastes bad had stomach pqinfor a full day had to go to the doctor
My wife & me tried this receipe! That taste .... Disgusting 🤮
Yummy😋
That looked like 2 cups of mayo not 1/2 cup 😳
32300 >)
Yummmm can't wait to try. Thanks
Well
More information
Good
Love all your recipes!!!
Look at her flex that spice drawer!
Good rescipi
hey lady ? what does a guy do when fresh cheese is almost impossible to find in the country and gold's more common ?  Could really use some pointers here to help cook for the elderly , They're really picky bout what they east so I try to keep things as 'Exotic' and healthy as possible . already had one of them get a stroke for sneaking snacks and skipping on meals .
I bet any leftover fries could be tossed into a breakfast frittata!
OMG i just saw your spice drawer...I am so jelly now 😛. Thank you looks so delicious and simple 😊 mm mmm. GOD bless
making tonite with boiled shrimp
Can another type of cheese be used...? Gouda?
Alternate hands for the dipping process! So obvious....sigh. 😀
Woww amazing! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just tried it tonight, it was very tasty 😋😍 thank you so much for sharing 💗
i made that sauce and used this recipe it’s delicious!!!! very good way better than i expected
Yum!!!
Another delicious-looking recipe!  Thank you very much.
Just made this, my sis and I loved them. Thanks (used Parmesan instead of the flour as well)
Love your vids. Would you consider not playing music in background
I made these with goat 🐐 Gouda since I can’t do cow and used olive oil as I can’t so eggs....SO good! Thank you!
Good Morning,  Thanks for the video... That can we use in place of Egg?
How many calories pleas
We enjoyed this recipe!
Nice Channel and good recipe shared...super work 2 minutes campaign. whenever you watch any body's video on youtube please watch it at least for 2 minutes otherwise waste we have to support every hardworking & honest youtuber no those who buy watch time etc.
Hi 👋 just found you and I like your recipes so just subbed 🤗 thanks 😊
I go out on my patio....LOL
The moment I saw the spices drawer, my jaw dropped. Love the recipe, will surely try it. Thanks for sharing.
I don’t eat eggs; could you please share a substitute for eggs for this recipe?
Fries in the oven :D   Make my comment great!
I like  this recipe  yes will try Good 🤘😊
I like your spice rack!! Wow!!😍😍
Thank you, that was delicious!
Loved the zuke recipe but will be making a tzatziki instead for an even tastier option.
That’s some meat prepping , I’m all over the place . I can have the biggest kitchen and still not have enough space .
Hi,  Look at your spices drawer, I am so loving it.
The spice drawer has been discussed, so I will say as the guy with an eggy cheesy mess, her hand discipline is samurai level...
love the spice drawer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! : )
If you are allergic to eggs, is there a substitute?
What a great idea! Can't wait to try it!
zucchini is  not gluten free sadly :c
OMG !!!!! Love your recipes
😋  yummy 😋
Just found this vid and will try these today...hope my mum like them!! Only doubt I have is that my oven can b set as "bake", "broil" or both(hot up & down), so because I see ur fries r nicely grated I wonder what I should put. Dont want them to burn!😜 Thank u!!! Awesome channel!
I LOVE ZUCCHINI !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your cool
Love the orchid in the frame!
Salt the zucchini wedges and rest them to let the moisture out. Drain before use. Don’t add more salt in the coating. Add cornflour to the coating and it will be crispier.  I hope that helps. This was delicious 😋
Are they really gluten-free.  I always thought zucchini was made from wheat, just like potatoes.
If only people would realize that the garbage brand name cereals they feed their children is nothing more than sugar and cellulose (tree pulp)!
"Ain't nothin' like the real cheese baaaby; ain't NOTHIN' like the real cheeeeese!....'. 😁  Could I substitute yellow summer squash for the zucchini here? While I love zucchini raw, I am not a fan of the texture when cooked.
Looks yummy !! Im am going to try them
There is no such thing as fresh parmesan cheese. It is more than 24 months old cheese! Good recipe though!  Ps...Oohh ...by fresh you mean a whole piece...
I just stumbled across your video. I think this is a great recipe and I'm going to try this sometime this week. Thank you for posting this.
This lady has a very gentle and kind smile and facial expression. It's really sweet to see, especially during present times.
Looks good. But lose the music it’s hard to hear you
i love these! so healthy and yummy! thanks for sharing!
Those look great. Too bad I'm not keto or gluten free.
Excellent job thx 🙏. If Vegan, substitute with Nutritional Yeast and egg with Chick pea/ Gram flour.
Add a little corn starch and you’ll really improve the crispness.
I saw something similar on this channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/KetoMond  Love keto. Keep it up! 😊
😋💕
It was so delicius, I can't wait to make them again 😍😍
Did I miss what temperature to have the oven?
Almond Flour is carb friendly/ low carb. It is about 53% dietary fiber.
Dang those look goooooooooood....! I wasn't hungry till I watched this.
Wow! Clever woman...
Awesome and nice hands to.
This is world peace in action x x x thank you
Bake at what temp?
Hey Americans, why are you often using garlic powder and onion powder? Why not fresh? Greets from Germany
Making for the first time with zucchini from the garden. All I have is the cheese in shaker can but will try again with fresh parm. Can’t wait to see how it turns out!
Definitely making these bad boys!! I bet it would taste awesome with a nice Double IPA. I’m thinking a Racer5 or a Hop Stoopid👍👍
I love your spices drawer ! 👌
Love this...  I ve made your shrimp chipotle peppers recipe and it was a hit in my house💕, Wow thank you.  I will make zucchini tonight as I love zucchini and is my go to vegetable and don’t have enough recipes for it.
what would be the best way to meal prep this? make the amount you want day of or could these be prepped and frozen? I am the only one in my house hold who likes zuccini and I don't think I could eat 16 fries that fast lol
That spice drawer is beautiful
... And goes great with skordalia.
Went low/no carb a week ago and am struggling for food, other than meat, eggs, spinich, etc. Thank you for this recipe. It looks like something I can do. Since it is just me, I will make a much smaller serving but it appears to be pretty quick in prep. Have to make a run to the store to get cheese & Zucchini. (I think I am getting low on Sour Cream, too). I will let you know how I make out with this. I am 77 and no longer adhere to rules very well. But just the ingredients in a bowl would be tasty. Just kidding.
im actually really jealous of that spices drawer!
Love your demo thank you. Will make it tonight. Xxoo
Perfect for airfryer.. will do immediately.. yummmm
Can’t wait to try this thank you
Looks great!
hmmmm... Ill just mention that eggs, and cheese are not healthy... But than again it is a KETO recipe...  Another version of low carb that will fade away...  Thank you for the good presentation though and it gives me some ideas.
Yummmmm
Love that stasher bag
Nice job. Thanks!
These were delicious!  I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise for the dipping sauce. Also excellent.  Thank you for sharing. 🍷
those aint fukkin fries. i mean imagine calling potato wedges "fries" INCORRECT
Loved your recipe
Trying this TONIGHT!
YUMM! Making, asap.
Oh my goodness, happy to have found you. With my new dietary restrictions due to health you help me enjoy all the vegetables in the best way. Can't wait to make it! 🙋❤️
I miserably failed, probably because I used alminium foil instead of baking paper and gouda cheese instead of parmesan, zucchinis got stuck but afterall they were tasty :)
Omg i love your spice drawer! And making your zuccini fries today.. 😍
= Low nutrient. 😂 All that frying dam killed the healthy enzymes off of this zucchini. Stomach filler it is!
TRADER JOES HAS PARM REGGIANO FOR 5 BUCKS. THE REGGIANO IS MORE  FLAVORFUL THAN JUST PARM.THEY HAVE HIGHER CO STANDARD I THINK ITS ALL CHEESE NO WOOD!
Is there a substitute for the egg?   I'm highly allergic to eggs (Not dairy)
Way totally rocks....thanks
Why don't you use tongs instead of hands?
Your presentation is terrific, well done, thank you!
Why would almond flour be non keto in this recipe ?
Your spice drawer is amazing!
Thank you for the rare recipe  and  continue to be shining as you do  .
just made these, they were delicious! they went way too fast! 😂
was wondering if there was any way to attach the cheese to the zuccini without using egg as im not keen on using eggs at all
Ummm looks good!
Yummmmm
YUM!
Sounds like a good recipe, and a good variation of zucchini fries. Thanks for the recipe and the very clear instructions.
Doesn’t it turn into a big sloshy, watery mess
Looks delicious!  I missed what to set the oven to and then bake for 15 minutes before turning over for another 15 minutes?  Thks
Is it a necessity to use parmigiano cheese or can I use a different cheese?
I do keto~ make sure your mayonnaise is made with avocado oil
i loved the recipe but the pronounciation of parmeggiano reggiano was painful
Looks delicious
I need that spice drawer. It's so organized.
Making
Do you have a crispy dairy free option?
1:58 Can't take my eyes off the wonderful spices and herbs 🤤
You really have overly huge veggies
your videos make me want to stop working and cook all day! so much fun. Thank you!
its cute how u said parmigiano reggiano 🤓
Hi there. Loving watching your videos...was wondering what you do with all the food you cook??😊💕
YOUR SPICE DRAWER THO’!! 🥰
Just made these and they are delicious!! 😋
what temp? did you say in the vid?
Thank you for this ,my daughter misses French fries  ( gestational diabetes) I will make these for her .
In UK with call them courgettes Or courgetti instead of zoodles
Do you recommend against salting the zuchinni to remove the moisture?
Yummy
Lol "keto"
Lisa, can you provide another similarly safe alternative to stasher bags? In Mexico, where I live, they are crazy expensive. One bag is half a weeks grocery bill. :-(  Thanks!
Thank you for ALL your amazing videos and healthy recipes. I am a busy doctor and never thought I could find time to prepare a healthy meal. BUT, your videos changed my life! God bless you. Keep it up! Konstantinos.
I so enjoy watching  Downshiftology, so clean, simple and accessible are these recipes and also nutritious, delicious and affordable.  Congrats Lisa Warm Regards Sandy S from Australia.
What if it was air fried?
You are the best
So, I'm lazy.... Would it make a difference at all to just put the  zucchini skin side down when they go in the oven? Or would they end mushy?
this tastes soooooo good!!!! loved it
Bake at what?
What would be considered a serving size on this recipe 😩?
You never said the temp to bake at?
Can you use the powdered Parmesan
I don’t know who’s yummier the host or the zucchini 😘✨.
Def trying this!!! Looks so good
why called it fry if they are baked?
I wonder if these taste better with a sauce made from yogurt instead of mayo
Thank you for your recipe, I had so many zucchini sitting out waiting to spoil and then I found your recipe. I tried it  y cooking in the oven and cooking in the airfryer. Both were very good. Thank you once again.
I love your spice drawer!
Has anyone tried putting them in the fridge and then popping them back in the oven in the following days? was just curious to see if these are a type of meal prep that can last a couple of days without losing out.
You definitely need parchment. I was out. Used something else ... 😢 Did keep my fingers clean!
Lost me at cheese
Just made these tonight.  I added just a bit of Ranch seasoning to the cheese and made a Ranch seasoning/lemon juice/greek yogurt dip that was the perfect compliment!  So easy and yummy! Thank you!
Just curious, why at 2:09 did you say "if you're not concerned about low carb, you could opt for 1/2 c almond flour" when almond flour is absolutely low carb and keto freindly?
OH i love your spice drawer.. i love spices too ! Thanks you for this video i was looking into how to make these
My mom great cook ..used to cook a lot like you!  Memories...
Thank you for this  recipe I would put  yogurt instead mayo
Great recipe, looking forward to cooking this! Great job also on the channel, you are an inspiration to me.
in less than 3 minutes and then make more!  Hi from Delaware!
Can I not use cheese?
Youre so beautiful there"s a calm to you and voice. Thanks for sharing.
Love your spice drawer!!! 😍
Very GOOD. Lady.
Loved it!!!
Yas, ive been wanting to start a lower carb diet and this looks like a perfect snack/side!
Do you have a alternative for the egg? I’m allergic to eggs but they look amazing! 😁
Looks delicious and super Tasty.  Well done  Yesterday I started dieting so I will follow your recipe.
can i skip or replace parmesan?
Why didn’t you just grate the cheese straight on the glass container instead of the plate? The grater would’ve sit flat on the container
Cannnnn I use different cheese? Like mozzarella???????
Is there an alternative for the cheese ? I can’t have dairy 🥺
Will nutritional yeast work instead of cheese. I hate cheese and am a bit lactose intolerant
One of the best (if not the best) food bloggers on YouTube. I’ve learned so much from her videos. Her site is even better!
Awesome and simple recipe thank you
Fantastic! Thank you so much
That spice drawer wow!!!
Mine stuck to the pan... And I followed it to the t...
Where do you buy your fresh cheese
Quick question.  I was thinking about buying a boos block cutting board.  But the wax and oil you treat it with I don’t want my food touching... any thoughts?
Nice spice drawer!
thanks for the video! But why do you talk like a robot?
Just found your video and i think i am gonna love ur recipe,cant wait my zuchini plant in my back yard,best regard from far away indonesia👍👍💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
You are like...so talented
That spice drawer! I want! Love your channel I’ve lost 4lbs . It’s a start & feel so much better 👍👍
Remember zucchini is a fruit eat sparingly.
Thanks for that information on the wold pulp. Wtf thats so disgusting! Why!?
Can you make this a bit more energy efficient and eco friendly way? Lots of energy for a few bits of veggies.
Dude look at that spice drawer! Now that is kitchen goal 😊
These look amazing. Thank you for always providing such quality recipes and ideas. We have an egg allergy in my family. Do you have any ideas for substitutes that will help the seasoning stay on the zucchini?
You shouldn't keep zucchini in the refrigerator.
You lost me when you used eggs.... Is there a substitute?
Hot.  Fries ain't bad either
Thanks.  Could do without the 'whistling' in the background music.
Hmm, looks great. I wonder if you could do this with jalapenos as well?
You lost me at parmesan. ...PEOPLE cheese is very bad for you. Do your research from a source not backed by the American dairy association.
Too much talk
What temp was the oven?
Yummy 😋
It’s so annoying how every tasty, healthy, gluten free recipe goes crazy with the dairy and cheese which is just as common of an allergy.
I loved this..And your video was simple and direct...So clean..some of us are messy..though.. Thanks
Short and to the point ! Love it !
Why can't Americans say parmesan properly? Par-me-san its not difficult. Or par-me-jan-o if you're pronouncing it in italian
Want that spice draw!
What do you do the left over cheese
For those with a dehydrator or gas oven , dehydrate for 6 hours prior to get real crispy  fries.
Thanks for the single hand tip. Like that you broke it down very simply!
Well thanks for the recipe and the info on the cellulose and preheated cheese...wow. one more wow inall the food poisoning wows I've learned the last few years😢😢😢
Do you know how many carbs there are in this recipe?  Thanks.
Thanks. Can l use another types of cheese?
I like this recipe. I must try it and I let you know. All the best!
I heard tomatoes are also gluten free
Why do you say almond flour is not low carb
For vegans, would flax egg work in place of the egg?
wow have to try this it looks soooooo good! Thanks for posting
I use sour cream for dipping..😍
I can't have no dairy products
I enjoyed by wastching it, later in going to try , tks
Great.
Love the recipe hate the whistling noise
Greek yogurt instead of mayo????
Awesome! I just bought some zucchini at the farmers market yesterday! Gonna try this!!
Nice
Great! Please, what mayo is that???
Excellent 👍 👍 presentation 👍 👍
Can I make this without eggs please?
NUM, NUM. Looks delicious
Thank you!
A big thumbs up! Yummy
vegan would be better
Supper yummy!!! I love this recipe!!!
J'aime beaucoup cette recette, simple et savoureuse! Good job 👍 Best regards from France
You are on gluten free diet because of some desease?
So Keto diet is fine with mayo?
I found that by turning off the very annoying and unnecessary background whistling I still could get the gist of the recipe.
Broke the stem off the big zucchini in the garden while harvesting (huge overnight storms this week!)... This is what I’m doing for dinner! Not sure what will pair best with the zucchini since we have picky eaters... 🤷‍♀️
These were good, not great. My daughter commented that the word “fries” in the title is misleading.
Almond flour is low carb why did you say if your not concerned about low carb use almond flour and parm
Like if you would love to get the macros from each recepie.
Garlic in mayo is not aioli. It's garlic mayo.
Just finished making them cant wait to try
Make a vegan version omitting the egg and cheese, substitute nutritional yeast and sea salt for seasoning.
Great video
You forgot to tell us what degree you put in the oven
I always fry them in thin slices on cast iron skillets, once half done pours eggs, flips and coats parmesan cheese right there.  Quick, tastes good, eats with tomato sauce.
Yum
Very well organized, informative, and well spoken! Thanks for the recipe!
Yum, these look great!
Thank you for your video. The background whistle music is distracting.
The outside was super crispy, but the inside was a little mush. How do I stop this?
Yum this looks great! I can't wait go try these!
Spice draw goals!
The drawer what a dream 🥰
YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your recipes are amazing and inspiring. Thank you!
Good. Video.. love it. Keep it coming
Start 0:49
These look delicious... I also feel like I have been storing my spices the wrong way after seeing this. :P
is almound flour not low carb?
Make it vegan for us
I just discovered you and SOO glad I did!!!   So when you say mayonnaise,  what kind of mayo, did you make your own, or store bought?  thank you!
anyone know a way to make these Whole 30?
DAMN, look AT ALL THOSEEEEE SPICES 😁😁😁
Can I use the same method to make  sweet potato fries ?
That spice draw!
Thank you for this recipe I’ve been looking for something different with zucchini I like to ask about your garden with your herbs how did you do it
Almond flour IS low carb. Less than 5g carbs per 100grams of flour!
Yessss thanks for this video fast , easy and delicious 🤤 I will try this tonight ,, hugs from Australia
so nice neat and organized!! thank you
Will make! Yum!
Can’t wait to try this! 😋
Great! Just take the tray out of the oven when you flip them in order to keep your temperature high 🙂
I have a granddaughter who comes over every week for supper and she is gluten-free. Maybe she wont always have rice now that I know your recipes are gluten-free from Ontario Canada
These look yummy. Can't wait. Love sweet potatoes fries, so this will be awesome.
Try zucchini fries with yogurt dip next time, it's so delicious. Thanks for this wonderful video.
I truly love love your spicy drawer... And will try to make it. Thanks
I've got to make these.  yum yum yum
It’s so satisfying to watch your videos. Everything is so neat and clean
Yum! So love your channel! I will be making these soon.
How many calories?
Looks delicious!!!  Will try this out!
I made the zucchini fries, great recipe!
I just love your style in every way! I feel very inspired and willing to adopt more of your advice! <3
Of all the food channels to follow for a healthier lifestyle I’ve begun following yours. Keto is gaining strength in Pakistan too! Thank you, for all the help! ♥️
These look amazing. Thank you for sharing such wonderful recipes and tips!
I made these and followed the recipe and tips. They tasted DELICIOUS!!!  I didn’t make the sauce but used ketchup😂. Still tasted great 👍🏻
luv luv luv your videos... I basically do low carb but plan on using alot of your recipes!!
I love your recipes and videos but your knife skills scare me. I'm always scared you will cut yourself. I was a chef for years and I would have been on you in my kitchen about knife safety.
Your recipes are so great! Thank you for doing what you are doing :)
You look like phoebe from friends x
O M Gosh this was so good ! I tried them recently and I could not stop eating them they are almost better than fries but you are correct must eat them out the oven!!!
OMG, I just made these (without dipping sauce) and they were delicious!!!! So, so, good!
Yogurt & curry powder is good for dipping too 👍😜DMc Thanks 🙏
Dam that some spice collection!
Wonder what these would do in a dehydrator or freeze dry machine???  Yummy!!!,
Have you tried Houston enzymes from Iherb?  DDPlV is in product called AFP Peptizyde it helps digest protein, gluten, and casein.  Tri Enza  from Houston Enzymes are amazing!!!  It aids in digestion no matter what you are eating but helps digest veggies!!!  AIP diet has changed my life!!
Yum
Your spice drawer is to die for!!!!!!
Again great and easy!
I made this last night. Delicious!! You have a new subscriber! My husband bought my first Veggetti (one of my early Christmas presents). I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and was afraid I couldn't turn the crank but the blades are so sharp, it's no problem at all. I'm on Keto, so this is a very useful kitchen tool to have. I've been binge watching your videos, love them all.
I love your video and the clean, minimalism style! I am just curious what camera you are using to produce these clean content?
What about if you're vegan? any tips for the cheese & eggs etc?
Do you have any tips on how to keep your baking sheets looking so new? I have the same ones and find that getting stubborn stains off can be difficult. I always use a parchment liner but that doesn't catch everything. Or are you using new ones for you videos LOL. If you have a secret magic trick, I wanna know! :)
holy zucchini, that looks great though 😍👍
würde direkt
Thanks for this recipe it tuned out to be really delicious! I cut some slices thicker than the others and they were too watery for my taste. So I'd recommend to cut them thinner for better crispiness!
Who else thinks she looks like an older version of Phoebe from Friends? 😂
What would you use instead of Parmigiano Reggiano? (I don't eat dairy)
Both sides do we have to microwave for 15 minutes each?
Loved the recipe. Can I prepare it in advance and bake it later?
Wow, those look absolutely delicious! Although I don't really like lemon much, so I'll probably skip on the sauce or the lemon lol xD
1:56 glory moment! Are you rich, right?
Why is everything Gluten free??? Is there that many suffering from Celiac disease?
It looks really nice♥
Mine came out extremely mushy is that normal?
I appreciate each of your videos, as they are really informative.  I notice that you don't mention composting.  Are you able to compost your veggie scraps in your location?  If so, would you share your process?  Thank you so much for being an inspiration.  I have been utilizing several of your meal-prep ideas, and they are spot on!
I´ll do them TONIGHT !!!!!!!!
I did not expect the recipe to be this simple! Definitely making these tonight! Thanks!
Hi. I was just wondering how long your cheese lasts like that in the stasher bag?
Thank God I'm not pregnant cause seeing her eat those amazing looking food would kill me
Zucchini never looked so tasty! Thanks !
That spice drawer - WOW!! Can't wait to make these. They look delicious : )
I've never seen where to buy your grader...
this is more like zucchini slices and not zucchini fries.
I am going to have to try this.  Thank you for this receipt.
Can you recommend an egg substitute for this recipe? It looks great but my husband is allergic to eggs ☹️
These were so delicious thank you! I’ve made 5 times already!
I just found your channel and its been a lifesaver! Much easier and more organized than other channels.  I just found out I'm allergic to dairy and gluten so a lot of these recipes are working for me!
looks super good those fries
I'm allergic to eggs so the egg dip before cheese and the aioli are out for me. Think I can substitute yogurt or buttermilk for the egg ... and can certainly use a Greek yogurt substitute for the aioli!  Ready to try this delicious snack!
I just created a youtube account like 5 mins ago just to subscribe to your channel. Your food looks amazing. I have PCOS and my naturopath advised me to start eating more whole foods, and cut down as much as possible on carbs and eat more healthy fats and proteins from whole foods. With your amazing recipes I am definitely going to have a much easier time with the changes, thank you so much.
Would luv to see a video on your herb garden,  I am going to try these on Sunday, no more grated parm for my fam
Low carb, but very high in fat
I've recently realized I had to change my diet, big time. It was easy to see what I should avoid (most gluten, everything greasy or fried, high sodium, *all* processed foods). These are pretty common. Not that I was going overboard compared to what others can tolerate, but I realized that every time I eat these foods I feel *sick*. I started eating according to  how I feel after I eat and have since transitioned to a more raw/whole foods diet. Your channel has helped me see all the healthy food options available (rather than focusing on all the foods I have since cut out) and how to make them tasty! Thank you for sharing your recipes!
I love your channel so much. Thanks for all the tips trying these tonight :)
YUM!!  I have some fresh zucchini that someone gave us and making these today!

Hi Lisa! Love all your videos, especially the meal prep ones. Fall is coming, Could you please make a Fall seasonal meal prep video? Thank you!
That's good idea for zucchini recipe thank you for sharing
Just subscribed😃
Lisa, im new to your channel but Ive already watched every single one of your videos! I absolutely love your videos, the content, the edition and the and how peaceful it is! You are very knowledgeable about food, could you do some videos explaining the benefits of food, superfood, and etc? thank you
What do you do with the leftover parmesan from the breading?
I absolutely love zucchini and will be trying this recipe soon. Thank you for sharing!
I love zucchini, never thought of making fries with them, thanks!
👍👍
Zucchini is one of my favorite foods! I'm definitely adding the ingredients to my shopping list this week. Please do more food prep and recipe videos. I, too, am gluten free + I'm allergic to regular potatoes (sweet potatoes are fine as they're not genetically related). I also have to watch my vitamin K intake as I am on Coumadin.   I love your recipes and your prep ideas. They make so much sense! I am incorporating them into my daily routines.  Thank you for all your inspiration!
How to fry on the stove
i am really hating keto...not good for egg allergy sufferers
Thanks! Now I have my veggies for Friday's dinner. Great idea. Love your channel.
What’s the best way to make this vegan?  No egg and no dairy.
my mom died of cancer years ago and you would be the best mom
Thank you for sharing this recipe! It's on the menu for this weekend.
hope you can answer this whats the net carb for each/calories wise? if i make these? i'm on low carb  keto diet as well :) and i love french fries and would love to make this :D ( u just got a subscriber as well <3 ty f or sharing ur recipe :D
ZucchinE😂
Dairy isn't vegan.  Also I am allergic to the casseine in dairy.  What do you suggest replacing the dairy with.  If I use all almond flour does that work?
Loved it. Your videos are so amazing. Is there any egg and cheese substitute for vegan people like me? I would love to try these
Yasss. I am making these at the moment. They’ve been in the oven for 20 mins and the entire kitchen smells soooooooooo gooooooood 🤗 I. CAN. NOT. WAIT. ☺️☺️☺️ thanks for all the tips, Lisa 😘
This is awesome! Going to make these for my family this weekend :)
LOVE LOVE LOVE your herb and spice drawer! wow! I will add this when we get new cabinets.
yum I juat bough a nice zucchini from the farmers market on Saturday,I'm making this
Yum! Great recipe! Just subscribed:-) is there a mayonnaise that you could recommend ??
oh, what a great recipe! I‘ve made them today, they were sooo delicious! Using half a cup parmesan cheese and half a cup almonds makes them extra crispy. For the aioli I‘ve used low fat mayo and jogurt - the dip becomes much lighter and tastes extra fresh because of the jogurt. Thank you so much for this recipe!
Hi Lisa, I really like all your videos, overall those about recipes and food prep. I was wondering if it could be possibile for you to make one about peanuts butter and one about Vitamix. Here in Italy it does not existe and I can only buy it on Amazon, but shipping is very high, so before the purchase I would like knowing somenthing more about it. Perhaps someone else would too . Thank you and as usual sorry for my English ☺️❤️
Yummmm!  Thanks Lisa for another great video.
Great video, as always, Lisa! Thanks so much for the Inspiration! Xx
Hi, great video as always, just sooo nice to watch!! How do you store your Parmesan, in the frigde or freezer? If in the fridge, how long does it last more or less? Thank you!
Wow! These look amazing! Can’t wait to make, thank you 😊
omg those many herbs. I'd love to have such complete kitchen!!
Hi, what is the sauce?? many thanks.
Hello,  I really enjoy your videos. I'm not sure you have it or not, but if not, could you please do a video about safe cookware, non-toxic ones? If this kind of video already exists could someone link it. thank you!
yummy! That looks so good! I definitely have to test this one out this week! Thank you for another great inspiring recipe​! Love it!
Hi.. it looks great. Can u  give substitute for Egg??
100% trying this on my day off this week.  I would be excited about a yogurt prep video. I know you made a DIY video for the yogurt itself, but I was wondering if you like to prep yogurt meals in advance.
These look amazing & I can't wait to try them out 😍
We made these tonight. Absolutely tasty! I added tellicherry pepper after baking - so delicious. I will be making these again. Have you tried the same recipe on yellow squash?
Cant wait to try this recipe, yum
very delicious
Yum I gotta try this never seen them before
Yummm
Love your videos!! Thanks for sharing.....
Now if we can just come up with a substitute for the egg and the cheese and we will be good..
What brand of baking sheets do you use?! Thank you! Love your videos!!
Everytime you open that spice drawer I gasp on how perfect it is... I love Simply Organic Spices! Great video Lisa!
THOSE LOOK SOOOOOO DELISIOUS!!  What pans do you use to bake with?
Lovely jubbly 😊 thank you for another great recipe 😙
Oh, my!  These look so delicious...I can't wait to give them a try.  Thanks for the tip about freshly grated cheese. ​
Oh, very delicious. I adore zucchini 😋
Loooove your channel 😍😍😍
I have been waiting for something new. I am still crazy about the broccoli. This will be added to my Keto Meals.
All of your veggie recipes look amazing; I just can’t make myself eat vegetables!
This looks wonderful, will be making these for sure!!
I will definitely try this out this weekend #tfs :)
Looks so yummy. I'm hungry now
Hi Lisa. I was wondering, do you have any help while filming? Great recipe BTW as always
Great recipe! I'll definitely try it on the weekend! Thanks a lot!
You look so nice in black!
Wow, those look yummy!  My teens make dinner sometimes so I'm asking them to make this when it's their night.  Thanks!
I have to agree with Meah Leonidas! I love that spice drawer. I ate some zucchini and baby bella mushroom sauteed with onions and garlic with a little olive oil salt and pepper and it was delicious.
I love Zucchini, thanks for the recipe. I'm planning to make this next week.
Do you have an opinion/info if roasting veggies takes nutrients away? I'm just curious. I hope not, b/c I love roasted veggies! These look amazing. Thanks for the info on the parmesan. Been staying away from a lot of cheese, but this one is a must especially since I'm half Italian, was raised on it. :)
What kind of baking pans did you use?
Hey Lisa, great tip on the one hand for dry and the other for wet ingredients. My hands always end up messy. Great substitute to French fries. I also add some curry powder in a box in which I put my fries and give it a good shake before serving.
Can you make this Vegan
Oh I want to try it 😋 looks so delicious 😘 like you I enjoy zucchini 👌
Can’t wait to make these! Thank you! 🤗💗
Will be trying soon. My son needs to eat veggies some how.
They look so yummy!  I am going to try these soon....did you eat all of them right away?  If not how would you heat them to eat later?
If you can only fit one pan in your oven at a time, how should you store the parmesan crusted unbaked zucchini? Refrigerator? Out on on the counter? Or just wait until the oven is free to make your next batch. P.S. love all your videos!
I m seriously gonna try them!!!!
Out of all the lifestyle channels I've watched, yours is the 1st I've subscribed to. I love your videos! Greetings from the Philippines 😀
They look delicious! I can't wait to try them. Thanks for sharing. ♥️👩‍🍳
these look so good!!
Oh my yummy 🤤 😋!!!! I’m definitely trying this fries 🤤🤤🤤
Yum will have to try this next Sunday!
Hi guys! You've been waiting patiently for this video after I teased you over on Instagram (ha!). So I'm happy to finally share it with you today. Make sure to check out the full blog post for more tips on making this recipe as well. Happy zucchini fry eating! xo - Lisa
