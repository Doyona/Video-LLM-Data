Hey guys! Do you eat apple seeds or spit them out?
This is why I only eat sliced Apples and not full apples
Interesting! 🍏 I always wondered if eating apple seeds was really that dangerous. It’s crazy to think about how something so small could have such an impact on our health. Thanks for breaking it down so clearly – I learned something new today! Looking forward to more videos on everyday things we often overlook. 👍✨
I will remember❤
Legends are watching eating apples seeds
Apple seeds juiced in most commercial apple drinks contain the seeds, I think we would know by now if they were dangerous.
I hope so
What if eat one
Ypu will need soil and soun for it to grow
2:03 thanks for the info
Yes
Now I know what the evil queen used to poison this apple
Who want to eat 18 apples in a hour lol😂💯🔥
Lies
Are deva
I always chew and munch apple seeds and I'm 60 yo and in top shape
I know a fact milk is not actually healthy cause lactose intolerant people can get stomachaches
I don't eat it
no
I was eating apple when I watched this
Why is palm oil used a lot in almond butter ??
I think the seeds are toxic.   Peace pits have cyanide.
Amygdalin or vitamin b17. Look it up!
I swallowed oneeee
I mainly eat the seeds.....they're great.
Man my friend is gonna die she’s old enough to stop eating it
I thought it will grow inside you 😂
I eat the whole apple always.
I like how this video starts of by asking 'what happends if you eat apple seads by accedent?' Impling youre not suposed to eat them. would of been more subjective if you left the 'by accedent' part out.
I have eaten apple seeds for around 8 years every day-💀
Satu, Saya pikir saya hanya akan makan itu  apel...
yum seaweed
Doesn't most honey you buy at the grocery store contain fillers?  Would these fillers make the product spoil?  Anyway, I always thought it was cool (no pun intended) that there was seaweed in my Heavenly Hash.
looking for answer in the comments. I don't have 10 minutes to spare.
Poppy seeds how to get high
X
So weird to see my honey from 2021 to 2022!
I eat apple seeds - daily and chewing them very well. You have to understand what the mechanisms at work here. I eat lots of them.
This is thot true i have eaten like 100,000 apple seeds and im fine
I eat all my apple seeds. B17
I had a very awful toothache before and it was from my broken tooth. I think the pulp of it is exposed. As I was eating apple mindlessly, I didn't realize I ate the seeds. I just kept eating it (crushing it actually) because maybe it won't do anything. Next day, I had the toothache and the pain was like what it happened 8 years ago when I first broke that tooth. The pain was like you were punched too bad, (I wasn't punched back then, the real accident was when my jaw got hit, never felt the same pain after 8 years) I cried many times  for it and it took 3 days for the pain to fade.  My question is, did the apple seed took part of my toothache?
I always eat the apple seeds, AND I crunch them between my teeth before swallowing them, in order to release the cyanide.  Never had any ill effects.  Some people think they have benefits, so why not?  No harm.
I think I always use to eat orange seeds by accident
In 3rd grade I would see some kids eating whole apples and as a kid I was traumatized lol 😆
Whoever loves Bright Side give a 👍 here  👇
I heard , some time ago, that eating crushed apple seeds will help with radiation poisoning……..is that true??
I like the apple part❤️
i have a question what will happen when i eat the seed of apple the white thing inside of the seed?
What about the fact that Cyanide doesn't harm healthy cells ONLY the harmful/mutated cells?? Also what about Rhodinase that protects  you from getting poisoned when eating apple seeds??? Healthy cells are not affected by Cyanide/B17 only the bad and unhealthy cells are killed by the poison. Nice video but you kind of left out some really important and relevant information..
Lemons 🍋cherries🍒kiwi🥝watermelon🍉 are my favorite fruits
I search it becuz i accidentally eat apple seeds
The most amazing video I have ever seen
Not quite, that Apple cyanide is molecularly incomplete and actually healthy in small amounts
I’m out to the store to get some apples for myself of course
I swallowed an apple seed accidentally
I knew about the fact that the inner stuff of an apple seed is poisonous. And i tried eating that stuff but nothing happened to me and i was like PHEW
me eat seed 😎
wat das sbaribe meen
i like it i don't no about it
I think I just accidentally swallowed one. I'm scared now 😐
I Always eat the whole apple expect the stick
Nothing will happen.
Actually, there is no evidence that amygdalin is toxic to our normal cells. Our cells don't use beta glucosidase to brake down amygdalin to cyanide.
I got the xray is huntover on my mind
i thought pelitoxin was the most poisonus in the earth but i guese i was wrong ;^;
I served this video because I thought I accidentally ate an apple seeds but turns out it takes a whole lot more seed to actually be dangerous
Learned more from this then school
WOW That's Amazing Woohoo
65s water🚰goes bad meh..... 😒. hey what about seaweed flavoured ice-cream🍦.and 34s coffee☕
Every time I eat an apple, I eat the seeds. I take the time to dig them from the core. I make sure that I chew them up so that they can do what mother nature intended. The cyanide gets released only when it comes in contact with cancerous cells and I have never had a problem or any ill effects.
I like how we all started watching with apple seeds but kept going because it kept getting more and more interesting.
I spit them out
What! I ate seaweed?
Oh no
Thank you
WHO IS HERE AFTER WATCHING "MOM" MOVIE

#4 Palm oil is terrible for our environment!  Harvesting it is a major cause of deforestation and habitat loss for the endangered orangutans!  Boycott products containing palm oil!
Me thinking: it'll probably start making apples inside of me.
🔴🔵🟥🟦

Tq for the Information..
Has anyone else searched this up after eating whole apples for about 4 years?

A plant grow in person lung ,find it In google ,youtube

Pfft. Straight bs on the sugar.  Sugar is brown after it's processed from sugarcane.  Gets refined into common white sugar, just like how flour gets bleached white.  Some companies, do re-add molasses to make commerical brown sugar.  Natural, unrefined brown sugar is way better than refined white sugar and the commercial brown stuff.  Don't get it twisted.

I'm allergic to peanuts
Guys don't listen to this, if you are gonna watch these video's along, you have a big chance you will get scared  off anything, you should watch positive things, i know it is relatable to look to these video's, but not everything they saids is treu! Oh, and bright side, i really don't want you to lose subscribers , but i am just warning, you can get extremily scared, and u can get sick off that easily, sorry, just for a warn, not to offend anyone! ;(( but i already got a bit scared, and i regret looking these vids, a tip for you, bright side, make more positive video's please!
I love you is a poison  (143 Apple seeds) Large quantities of apple seeds can be poisonous 2:07
What about eating sprouted apple seeds? I know when seeds sprout their chemical composition changes.
not true
When I eat apples I eat the whole apple. Core seeds and all. I'm in my 60s and it hasn't killed me yet.
Today I ate apple seeds
Nothing would really happen if you ate an apple seed.
Like to join the late squad
Nothing will happen..eat the whole apple.
but l dont use teeh to eat chrry seed！lol！
I thoght I would doe the second after I swalloed it befor I watched this amazing video!
Cant believe this I've eaten apple seeds 2times and crunched
🍎🎂🧊🥃☕🥡🥤🍯🍦🍨🍧
I crushed 200 apple seeds and swallowed it. Nothing!!
I always eat apple seeds they contain vitamin b17 an anti casonogenic , as Hunter gatherers we ate the whole fruits we could not afford to waste anything the only reason we don’t eat them now is the fact they are bitter, the modern diet is lacking vitamin b17 maybe one of the reasons there is an increase in cancers
When I was a kid:  Accidentally ate a fruit seed:  Oh no a tree is going to grow in my stomach
started collecting apple seeds in case I need them
Brrrrilliant Presentation. A well-spent 10 minutes. Now I'm gonna have a few more spoons of nutmeg powder topped up with palm oil!
Oops i-

Seaweed, ahh meeen u kidding me, but I love ice cream 🤣🤣👍
I purposely eat the seeds and apple core. I eat the entire thing including the stem
Thanks to tell me how to die
When I saw the thumbnail I thought he'd tell that a tree will grow in your stomach
No, this may be happen in other countries but in India it is not, the molasses content is not been added to brown sugar in India. The brown sugar is pure and it is taken from sugarcane and I have seen it and eaten it
I bet most kids searched this up
I like how you explane!
I was seeing this video by eating apple
WOW! THAT'S  AMAZING!
""""""""I just swallow apple as whole.....nothing hapoened...do not worry..."""""""" Tura.

Does diabetes person can mixed white sugar, instead of brown sugar and sugar free.
I eat brown sugar but very little white sugar
Im pretty sure most people avoid palm oil because harvesting it kills orangutan habitats, not because they think its bad for you
You say by accident? Am eating it daily...
dont worry guys seeds need soil we imposible that seeds will grow on water and also! seeds float on water!
I never ate apple seed when I found out it CAN be poisonous I learned while reading science book when I was at 2nd grade
Wow that’s amazing

What The Apple Seed's is a Seed So You Can Plant a Apple Is That Right?😧
I thought apple seeds were healthy? My grandma said they were very healthy if you eat them and bite them? My grandma is older so um
Just because palm oil is not bad for you, doesn't mean you should eat it. It is very bad for the environment.
Hah! Jokes on you, im eating apple seeds on purpose! Take that bright side!
Bright side: What will happen if you ate apple seeds? Me (when I was 3 years old): An apple tree will grow inside our stomach.  Bright side: What will happen if you ate apple seeds? Me (when I am 14 years old): It will be digested
Jus chewed about 12 apple seeds. I luv chewing apple seeds. It trains your internal organs well and keeps them in shape. I am sure some study in near future will prove it ...
About others seeds like of papayas, lemon?
Hey... your info about sugar is totally wrong....the colour of sugar as it comes from the cane is  naturally brown,....it is bleached and processed in order to get it white...brown sugar is just a little less refined.
Wow that's amazing

Nice information ty
What the narrator forgot conveniently to report, is that apple seeds directional toxicity...always with help of experts advice, dosage etc etc...belongs to the most potent current and future arsenal against cancer cells under continuous vibrant experimentation...but then again some are really benefiting from cancer sustainable, aren't they???

1:50 “the dose may become lethal. Ooooooooh!” Tf Lol 😂
Waoow
BRIGHT SIDE lies and is seriously misleading!
They say RAW SUGAR (which is brown) is what they mean by brown sugar that is healthier,  not regular marketed brown sugar?   Duh!
So you can crush up apple seeds and poison someone with them is what you are TELLING EVERYONE?  Good job, BrightSide!
I have eaten apple seeds when I was a child, who has not?  Everyone has eaten them!
Well this can’t happen to me I’m allergic to apples 🍎 so hey I can’t eat the seeds. Lucky me!!!
I always eat (by mistake) or to good to stop  watermelon seeds....

This is soooooooo wrong  !!!!! Apple seeds are CURE  against CANCERS  just like some other fruits seeds !!! Natural cures , as the scianide actually only kills the cancer cells.  Lol, Are you guys paid to misinform people ? Suggestion : check the real scientific facts !
Omg I eat a seed of a apple
Youll turn into Bertholdt and kick the wall in
Coffee is bad for us. It causes disease.   I can't believe how many lies are in this vid.   Some truth though.
What a freaking liar. I ate 800 apple seeds in one sitting ground up in smoothies. And end up healing from health problems.
ive been eating apple seeds for 7 years now-   ok
Amygdalin is found in many foods groups,Not just apples,And is also called Laetrile and is sold as B-17 which is extracted from the Apricot seed.I have seen testimonies of people taking Amygdalin for cancer treatments,But you cannot patent something that grows naturally,So therefore no money can be made from it,And the love of money is the root of all evil.
I have eaten apple seeds and still I am here. What about you ?     Like this if you also have eaten apple seeds.
So 142 is the limit     I see
My sister always told me not to eat 🍎 seeds But......     I EAT THEM IM A REAL FOODIE🍪🍰🍩🍦🍫🍲🍛🍓🍍🍒

This video is a Big Pharma production. Apple seeds and apricot seeds contain amygdalin, a combination of cyanide, bebzaldahyd, and two glucose molecules. Many people like me have eaten bitter raw apricot kernels for years without any side effects. Do your own homework and listen to the testimonials of those who consume Vitamin B-17 and bitter raw apricot kernels. Go to nature and you will see that all animals who eat fruit dig for the seeds and disguard most of the fruit. Animals are smarter and more honest than the pigs who run the CORRUPT American Pharm!
OMG WHAT

My parrot loves apple seeds (most seeds in general) and he can very easily crush, even hardest of seeds and eat them.  Till now he is fine and had never shown any effect of poison. But as a precautionary measure I will now remove all seeds from his apple.

Why some of your topic is not in the apple seed topic?
If something is powerful in it's grown up stage, then it would make sense that at it's most initial stage of growth-- there'd be some sort of poisonous factor harboring within it, where as it is not done producing the needed chemistry for such a future process that it entails.
Me: eats coffee in 5 years old* Me: gets healthy* Me: wow i did not get some diseases in 3 years

Apples seeds are poison for the body.
I’ve eaten tons of apple seeds I don’t feel any harm
C & H is real brown sugar, less processed than white sugar. They don't need to add molasses.
Apple seed's cyanide is B 17 or laetril. Laetril is cyanide that is chemically locked unless it comes in contact with cancer cells, which put out an enzyme that unlocks the cyanide, which then enters the cancer cell and kills it. Big pharmaceutical business doesn't want us to know this.
When I was younger I used to think a tree would grow inside me 😂😂😂
Nothing happens to me

Apple seeds taste bitter and poisonous, so why in the world would you eat them? I slice the apples and sometimes peel the skin off if they're not smooth or look fresh and of course take the seeds off. That way it'll be convenient to munch at them.

What would you do if your pet or child ate apple seeds? Would you say stop? Would you try to keep them safe? Would you tell them that it isn’t good for you? Would you try to take it out of there mouth?  What if they are it? Would you take them to the  Hospital or vet?

Guys dont get scared , just imagine. If apple seeds were dangerous then the phrase: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away" would not exist, the apple seeds cause 0,000000000000314% cyanide and 0,1 can be a litle dangerous , so you can keep eating apple seeds like i do everyday
You will grow more apples in your tummy and        Never go to the doctor agine
You win an APPLE IPHONE 25... kids... I'm at 23 seeds

Whenever I’m scared I heat up super quickly
The thing about nutmeg being a hallucinogen is a myth. Back in the 70s lots of people injested large amounts with no effect. It's like smoking banana peels, and it's false promises. Yet ingesting the inside of the Hawaiian baby wood rose seeds after burning off the poison on it's surface, I think stricnine is very hallucinogenic. One large tablespoon of the inside of the seed dried to a powder has a very DMT like  experience that lasts 8 to 10 hours. I layed on my bed and could hear many TVs,  people's voices cars, and the basketball court a block away with heavily colored patternes floating in the air mixing with and changing the room into all kinds of things with auditory hallucinations in spiralling pulsating electronic sounding tones. All of my senses were opened beyond belief, it was incredible. Be warned this substance can upset your stomach and cause vomiting in the first few minutes, but it passes. Salvia Divinorum a form of sage when smoked is like a 5 minute LSD experience, and is legal and can be purchased on the internet. I reccomend  100x strength. I don't know who started the nutmeg myth back in the 60s, but we need to drop it.
But what if you eat apple seeds on purpose? Lol I wouldn’t do that.
3:40 black or white does'nt matter dont be A RACIST

Palm oil might be helthy indeed, but you don't need to eat it intentionally, because palm oil is so cheap that lots of foods in package contain palm oil. Even if you don't eat packaged foods, palm oil isn't a must.
Um, some numbers talk about thing that don't go on topic with if you swollow a apple seed...

Apple seeds can be poisoning but only in very large amount to eat. Personally I dont eat any seeds,because everything what you can plant have enzymes inhibitors. Many people claim that apple and other seeds cure cancer-maybe yes,but at the same time it can shorten our lives,because of enzymes inhibitors.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.  But...  A seed a day gets the doctor's xray.
I only want to hear your voice, you only.

An apple tree grows inside of you.

If you swallow some apple seeds, smoke some cigarettes. The smoke will suffocate the bacteria in your stomach.
There are so many benefits to eating certain kinds of seaweed. And it can be really good in a salad.
I'm confused now because in one video it says apple seed cures cancer and in this video it is dangerous
American propaganda on the oil stuff? and brown sugar
I eat apple seeds
Wow! Icecream contains seaweed too? That's great! Thank you for telling me bright side.

The tree will grow inside you
I never really tasted any salty sea plant in my cone.

Before this video starts. I’ve eaten the seeds if apples by accident many times. So I’m guessing it takes a lot to make you ill
Hi, BRIGHT SIDE   Do you eat apple seeds or spit them out ? 🙏🙌🍎🍏🤔
Almond contains much more cyanide than apple seeds... As for the brown sugar: brown sugar is healthy, the colored table sugar though is called fake brown sugar.
What does the thumbnail even mean tho?
My granny used to tell when I was younger that an apple tree would grow in my stomach if I ate the seeds 😄
Palm oil should be avoided for environmental reasons as opposed to health reasons. The staggering demand for this oil is causing widespread deforestation of many tropical areas, destroying the habitat of much wildlife that lives there.
Nothing happens your body will break down the apple seed to SMALLER
I eat apple seeds many times
How do you manage to do a 10:01 min long vid out of a topic like this? Unbelievable?!

M kashmiri... M eating apples with seeds since i was kid...  I dont believe it...
After the nutmeg thing i had 5 teaspoons of nutmeg :))
Some mistakes but ok.
For every illness there is a cure on earth.  Seeds contain toxins to rid your body of things that don't belong inside you.  FDA cannot make money from selling seeds that cure illnesses.   FDA  can make money by prolonging illnesses and selling you medications that do not cure your illnesses.  The United States government knew in WWII  that certain seeds cure cancer cells and banned scientists from publishing that information to the general public.  Do your own researrch.
Hey brite side from where are you

You will not get cancer seeds are good for you .
Q:people say swallowing a watermelon seed can grow in your stomach,is it true????????
Any body else thought we they were little that if u ate any seed form any fruit.That fruit would grow inside your stomach and come out your mouth?
Depends on how hungry I am and on how good the apple is, sometimes I eat the core and all other times no. Will a seed grow far outside the relatively gentle 7.0 pH range depends on how far  you swing left or right on the pH scale. Everyone knows that, I think. For those who are unsure, drop a seed in some Hydrochloric Acid. Come back later to see your apple tree. Warning experimenting with extreme acids and bases can be harmful to life and limb. Study first.
Before I watch the video just want to say. I usually eat my apples vertical and eat the seeds.
I eat the whole apple core because I didn't want to get up to throw it away
Thanks
Dont look there below       You looked at now you have to like. You swore  at your own
Brown sugar is from vegetable seed that i dont know how to call him in english so its brown because that exept that white sugar is cleaner and to my opinion better
It’s true. As a state agriculture inspector for Washington state...it’s actually completely true! Good job guys for sharing!
If you eat apple seed and give yourself enough sunlight and water then you will have apple tree growing in your stomach as a result of nurturing that apple seed.
People who juice eat drink all the seeds.
Oil is used to preserve pickel
Ok, my fellow insomniacs. I know this video said that coffee can be extremely beneficial to ones health, but just make sure to not over consume it!! If you drink too much you can end up with major health problems. We can’t just ignore the negative here, people!! Most of these problems are caffeine related but even so just be careful.
Once my mom told me that if I ate apple seeds then apple tree will grow inside my stomach
I had a dog who used to eat apple cores. 🐕 🍎

I have eaten whole apples my whole life including pips I am nearly 45 years old now so only minute quantities of cianide are pressent in apple pips  also do u know of a similar UK based video as somethings r different in UK I think under UK law if a product states its Wasabi by law it must contatain Wasabi UK trading standards laws r quite strict in UK by law if product says it contains real coco powder 4 example then it must contain real coco powder unless it says coco/chocolate flavour or banana flavour it will be artificial and just to taste of chocolate when in fact it says chocolate flavour
Tsp or tabsp? 2:32
Heres the truth if you eat apple seeds what happens is they come out the other end .no harm .by the way no harm was done to any apple seeds in making of this fake video. Now you know.
If you say you will grow into a tree  I'm angry!
I remember when i was young i ate like 5 apple seeds , nothing happened
There are natural Brown Sugars out there however you have to avoid LArge OCrrupratuons if you want real healthy Sugars.
Why is this a 10 minute video. It was supposed to be about apples not coffee and honey.
I had an apple seed in my mouth once and was too lazy to take it out so I chewed it up and swallowed it 🤷🏻‍♀️😬

B17
I ate an apple seed. It turned into an apple inside me. I then ate the apple and all the seeds inside it. I pooped out more apples. Ate those too.  The end.
I thought that if you swallowed 🍎 seeds a plant will grow inside your body 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If you accidentally swallow an apple seed, don't worry. You have to chew it really hard and swallow it (and I mean *really* hard) to actually get sick from the apple seed's natural poison.
What is the thumbnail suppose to mean? Apples can be deadly?
Bro. I always eat apple seeds
Hey man did I tell you to stop you and with these conspiracy theories😠
So we can make our own cyanide pill with 143 apple seeds! Thanks for info.
Certain amount of cyanide is known to fight cancer cells also apricot seeds ,..so is not so bad for the body ...
If you ate an apple 🍏 seeds then there would grow a tree in your stomach 🙄😂😂
Can you guy plz watch my first uploaded vodeo

Brown sugar not contain chemical but white contains chemical.you are marketing white sugar.everything we eat naturally it s good.but when we eat artificially like white sugar .It has many chemicals
https://youtu.be/IqpCIrlW2pE
What if I ate 999 apple seed at a time?
Oops I just bit 143 apple seeds 🤣
Nothing would happen.
That's how Steve Jobs was born

Nonsense.
5minute crafts men/women. Please stop or I'm blocking you. \STOP/
I’ve eaten plenty apple seeds in my life. It wasn’t an accidental thing.
But i ate mine on purpose
Well I cursed like on my Apple see some of them thank goodness I'm still living =( and when i mean cursed them with my teeth and ate them .... Im so scared thank goodness that i dont eat apple alot ;-;
Nothing happens    Thank me later
Why you people only focused on the fact about apple? I can’t find any comment about other facts in the video -SMH-
dont eat apples then only no seeds
Is ate them, not only apple seeds. I even ate peach and plum seeds. I cracks them and ate as I like the smells.
And I ate a cherry seed before but. . . . . . . . It was on accident. 😊
Some things of the nutmegpouder sounds actually fun ... there is something wrong with me
you forgot to mention that apple seeds contain vitamin B17 which can help to prevent cancer cells and pharmaceutical industry dont want people to know it !!!
So why, if you have a vitamin A deficiency, should take palm oil, which gives you Vitamin E.
An apple o’ day keeps the doctor away, an onion o’ day keeps everyone away.
Wow...🤯
a takis a day keeps the haters away ooo gotem
I eat 3 apples with the seeds per day. It is one of the best ways to protect yourself from cancer. The seeds of 2 or  3 apples per day, contain as much as vitamin B17 you need in order to be protected from cancer. So, it' s so simple and easy!  Just eat 2 or 3 apples with their seeds(except pregnant women and very little kids) and you have a very good protection for your health.

I eat bakes apple seeds :))
My dad eats all the apple when he eats one, cause he wants to be like a horse! 😂😂😂
Does that mean turtles can have ice cream🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢
Does
Eat seeds from one apple a day. Don't overdo it at all. They can defeat cancer cells if you do NOT chew on seeds. Only seeds from one apple a day. You can eat other apples without eating more seeds.
They are good for you, occasionally  B17  Look it up
Lol I always eat the seeds
Wtb cherry?
Oh please I eat apple seeds all the time
Anyone wanna CHEW on apple seeds??? I want to end it

HI Guys! Good morning from down under! How are the bright siders ?? :: )) Hellow Mr Bright how are you ? : ))
I'm the 503 comment
Lol apple seeds are actually the healthiest bit
on the coffee thing, What if your'e intolerant to legumes?ive  found that coffee makes me bloated
If you eat an apple seed on purpose             Then you digest it and poop it out.
You’re totally wrong on the palm tree oil, coffee, And water bottles. Water bottles when stored in warm areas or sunlight begins to disintegrate the plastic in the bottle into the water. Also the vitamin found in palm oil can be found elsewhere in addition coffee has been linked to causing cancer. Maybe site your sources so ppl and double check what your saying instead of just having to assume that you’re right.
Wow! That was amazing! Realy!

Not a lot of time spent on the apple seed question.
How does this become a ten minute vid id make is a five min
This is BS propaganda by the 'medical industry' ($$$). Yeah, spit those seeds out so when you get cancer they can pump you full of chemo and irradiate you with gamma rays. Amygdalyn (Vitamin B17) attacks cancer cells and leaves the healthy cells intact (unlike chemo).
Congratulations for 20million subs!
IT IS BAAAD I KNOW
How dare you assume apples are my favorite fruit! I prefer grapes.
I eat the whole apple all the time . Have since I’ve been a child .
