I would not recommend using a blender. It will really whip it. Lots of bubbles. One of my sister said it and it was a little bit of a pain. It was still delicious but😊
If you do over mix it you need to let it rest because you’ll get the bubbles in it and then you gotta try to fill them in. It certainly is not a problem. I used my mixer much faster and just a little more patience. You let it rest, which is always good.
Nalisniki - this word is from Ukrainian. It’s Ukrainian language word! Not f…ing ruzzian! Not surprised ruzzians are stealing everything from everywhere!
yumyy
How much flour exactly. You showed 2 small spoons only and said to wisk after each addition. You don’t mention this in the description either. Is that only those 2 small spoons of flour in this recipe with 5 eggs?
Great recipe.  Have you ever tried them with vanilla, orange blossom water or rosewater added to the filling....it really takes these to another galaxy
Hello, these looks fantastic. I was wondering can they be premade and frozen? If so, how long can they be frozen till?  Thanks for sharing!
If Tatyana made these nalesniki for the Tsar, he would have made her a duchess!
Made your crapes with Tvarog 🤤😋😁
Is that an 8 or 10 inch pan
I just made your recipe and it tastes like heaven 😍❤️ you are amazing and also so pretty!! Thank you so much for this video Tatyana ❤️❤️
Just made some from another bloggers channel, will try your recipe next time.  Love your hair, wow 🤩
How much flour gig u add to the crapes? You say 5eggs butter milk and say spoon in the flour but never say how much of it you move right on to the ricotta cheese and so on.
Cheese filled blini.
Really clever way of mimicking the feel of real white Easter European cheese. Will definitely try this recipe out! Thank you Tatiana ^_^

Налисники ніколи не були російським,це українське слово.В Росії-це "блины или блинчики".
Strawberry* strawburry?
Hi Tatyana, . Greetings from Australia!  Aren't nalesniki usually filled with fruit as well as the cheese mix? Some nice tart cherries would counter the sweetness of the cheese and sugar. When you take them out of the oven add some more fruit and/or juice, along with some smetana mixed with mascarpone.
I made these, but did not like It. Everybody has a different taste
What temperature did you heat your oven?
You're crapes look really good.
u r a sexy achef and amazing. It looks beautiful and its make me hungry.... delicious I'm gonna try it..  fast question.... Are u single?
Незнаю поймешь ли но что ты сделала после того как выложила блины на форму? Оставила на 25 мин просто?
"nale-sneaky" lol
I tried this it didn't worked that well. The crepe were too crunchy. I wonder what did i do wrong.
