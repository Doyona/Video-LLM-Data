There are points that are outdated here.  Some misleading advice…

In 8 you can limit how much chips you put probably around 6-10 peices
I've always swapped out yogurt for sour cream I make my own soup w reduced sodium broth, some, veggies, and some chicken I'm starting t have a cup of soup before dinner n it seems r b working Cutting calories  Try it
Gee I learned so much from your video NOT
Who eats canned vegetables?? I only eat fresh ones … nuts are fattening
Minimal effort ; who are you trying to kid ??
So, where's the bath compared to jogging? 🤣
Brave of you to assume i have time to socialize with friends if i dont have time to go to the gym
Welcome to cap store we have normal  we 🧢we have  is that i supra cap 🎩

I want to lose weight overnight without doing anything..
Nice one ✔️👌
I never eat canned vegetables
Snake on dried fruits and nuts???😱
the best way for me to lose weight is to eat chocolate ice cream about 4 cups or more a day and eat a light meal like a small salad with hot spices and olive oil.
nice
i love you
I just done 2 month of exsersise end dayet end still do it for more 5 month so thanks my leter 😄
I don’t have stairs nor elevator
Who else does this during quarantine?
I’m on my weight loss journey, and I literally do minimal exercise and 110% changed my diet and I’ve lost 19lbs in 3 months 🥳🥳🥳
She lost me when she stated I consume 1000 calories when I go to a restaurant. Only a 1000? The dessert alone is 450-500 calories.
Ha ha ha
I am always hungry, I wanna eat all the time, lol
do your work out with music video
Green tea and small portions of food
Intermittent Fasting. I also concur that u will get used to black coffee. I actually dilute mine with just a tad bit of water. 55 lbs gone in 4 months. Of course other variables were brought into the mix as well though...
I had a great streach workout maybe an apple in the morning!!jejeje
Ugh, I already do almost all of these and I still can't manage to lose more than 2 ounces a day. Any other tips?
one meal a day is best
I go to gym every week and be motivated by the girls who do squads. I don’t know, I can’t just stop looking at them and feel motivated 🥰
Most of these are lies 🙄😑
Socialize at the gym?        Titles it “if you have no time for the gym”
1 dont waste money on a gym go for walks or find an activity that is fun for you so you want to keep doing it.  2 don't watch the news everyday to reduce stress 3 eat remotely and slow 4 don't get a job that takes 90% of your time if you can, spend time with your family do activities with them 5 have a remotely normal sleeping pattern 6 laugh alot, it reduces stress, burns calories and helps with health in general 7 don't go to fastfood stores 8 drink water
I don’t think frozen foods have that much nutrients either we should eat the fresh ones neither canned nor frozen! 🙏
Method : Don't eat 😔
I  eat only at 3:00 and i eat under 500g
Say no to sweets and dessert *shows delicious dessert*
I’m thin and I have abs why tf am I watching this .-. Oh ye it was recommended wow. YouTube thinks I not healthy XD
No 12 frozen veggies is not good at all, has too much sugar. Please read label before buying. If you really want to lose weight stay away from high carbs.
Why have I not lost weight
Dried fruit has more sugar than candy.
U always right bright side lv from Pakistan
God bless you
i want  2 ask you that  since m doing all this u told and 1000 crunches every day will i be able 2 loose w8 atleast in 2 month
For the pear jack is there any other fruits because I’m allergic to pears
c
what about fresh veg ffs ?      fucin septics
what about fresh veg ffs
I would like to say that if you just can’t give up ice cream, like me there’s a way to satisfy that craving... It’s called “nice-cream)! It’s where you just freeze bananas and blend them with other things like coco-powder, pineapples, strawberries or whatever depending on what flavor you want.  Pro tip!: When I  want to avoid that banana taste for certain flavors I use  grilled sweet potato or batata (a white sweet-potato) for flavors like matcha ice cream or Earl- gray ice cream where the banana flavor would interfere. And instead of using sugar to sweeten it, I use 4-6 pitted dates depending on how sweet I like it! This really helps!
*What if you don't have time for stairs?*
Well I'm gonna be eating fruit with pips for breakfast for a month...I better notice a change 😂 I do 20 mins of walking Monday to Friday for school and 25 minutes of exercise an hour before bed...I think that will help??? 🤣 I'm so lazy
I think I can do this I weight 95 pounds
I don't even drink coffee :)
The number one thing I suggest for losing weight is going vegan. I went from 190 to 145 pounds in just a few weeks, and from a size XL to small/medium. I also had way more energy to work out.
with exception to cofy & socialising at the gym, i'll try most of these along with my gym workout...
Why am i watching this while eating a donut with some cheesecake on top
Nice video .
When you want to lose weight but you don't want to waste your money on vegetables
Try! the (Snake 🐍 diet) 💯👍  if your really Serious.
I do the same as I usually do. Work. But I changed from eating processed food ro making it myself.
The struggle is real is great effort least a try.
ATTENTION !! Don't watch this video if you are on a diet ! Its been 5 days since i kept diet clear , but this video made me go ravenous ! So i had to eat cake ! 😌😏
I started my weight loss journey when I was in school. Always laughed at, bullied for my size. I tried exercise, diet, but I still was gaining weight. Eventually I fell into depression and was about to give up. What saved me? Funny to say, but a Shark Tank show, which on that day had a wight loss supplement company to pitch their product. So I tried it. And it worked! I lost about 110lb that year and never looked back! You can find it at bit.ly/freeketotrial they should be offering free trials at the moment. If not, you can still order it, it's more than worth it, believe me. It's called Keto. And I believe trials are available only in the US, if im not mistaken. Good luck for everyone who is struggling, and never give up, like I was about to, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel! JJ.
I was hoping for a quick fix solution, but no, it doesn't exist Theses aren't even real suggestions.  Swap canned veg for frozen? Who eats so much canned veg that it can have an impact? Realistically, you need to move more and eat less. That is it.
Brisk walking in place of running, no to soda and junk food for st least two months; this helped me lose close to 31lbs last year! In addition to daily morning home workouts of course.
A sh.....piece of prejudices!!!!!!
It would be better to swap candy for homemade smoothies and freeze the fruit you use yourself just remember not to use juice as the liquid base cuz of the sugar content
One of my favorite deserts to have is simply a baked apple. Fill it with some cinnamon, walnuts and a little (not much) brownsugar and bake. Its like an apple pie without the crust.
To me, it is bad to start your day with a bowl of fruits cuz the sugar in fruits is difficult to digest and some fruit have a high sugar content which means spiking your insulin level  thereby making it difficult to burn far.
and this diet is not good for health don't try it it's not good by using this diet at my class time I had no energy to do and write something and if you do it one days your 1 kg will be decrease
I use it diet morning one apple and evening one sweet 🍠 and night protein shake and now I am 43 kg and I am 20 years old
Thats what I did and how I lost weight two years ago. Still great. It works.
many bs here
Just eat 35% of what you eat today and walk for 5-10 kms daily  You will loss weight for sure

I took soda (pop) out of my diet for 5 days out of the week and started  walking while on my phone and I went from almost 300bls with pre diabetic down to 250 and I am diabetes free
Count the calories you have eaten and you have to make a calorie limit diet so don’t forget that
Thanks for the tips. I love hula hoops and I will replace my nachos and popcorn for hula hoops while watching a movie
Re-name this video to "How to be miserable by giving up everything that makes you happy" ... I agree with the stairs though.. take the stairs if you can.
Even better, swop canned veg for whole raw veggies and steam or lightly boil them if you like.
in 10 days i lose 3 kg
Why should I socialize at the gym if I don't have time for the gym?  The logic nowadays..

12 Ways to Lose Weight If You Have No Time for the Gym ... 5:42 Bazinga!
You forgot to add water to the list... drink plenty of water. 🙂
Fasting
dried fruit contains as much if not more sugar than candy
"12 ways to lose weight when you dont have time for the gym" number 4 socialize at the gym?? If you have time to socialize at the gym, you have time to be at the gym list fail, not so bright; bright side
But doesn't dried fruit contain a lot of sugar??
Make the time for the gym. Everyone has the time. You're just lazy
2:38 I don't have an elevator😥
1. how about replacing both canned and frozen vegetables with fresh ones. ditch the dish washer, washing machine and raise your legs to improve blood circulation. it works for me 2. playing a hoola while watching tv is distracting
Thank you
Quitting sugar has! 😉
That s already a lot of effort for a lot of people nowadays.
"Grab a hula hoop instead of bag of chips"... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You sound like Clover
My eating habits are eat takis lol
1 that has helped me most is being aware of what a serving size actually is.   and eating a serving and not a portion (portion is what you put on plate but a serving is what you should put on plate.  if you eat a portion that is 2 servings it has twice the calories of 1 serving.)
This does not help me at all im a teen!!
Give up all fast food
I remember giving up carbs like breads,flour tortillas,biscuits and lost weight faster, well I only ate crackers with my soup but I limit myself.
Minimum effort is laying in bed with only veggies and water easy
Note: Fats in food arent bad for you. You body needs them, you dint have to give up sour cream unless it has a ton of added sugar
Ive lost tremendous weight eating a 16 oz sourcream everyday along with swiss cheese and eggs...dried fruit is so not recommended for weight loss. Also, fruits in the morning on an empty stomach is an absolute NO NO!!!.
ineffective tips.
Dried fruit contains a ton of sugar.....
I had trouble loosing weight for years and then a friend told me about a sort of diet they had used and that it was about balancing foods you put in your gut which helps your liver function to speed up metabolism. I couldn't believe a simple thing would work but it really did. I lost 53lbs in 6 months and changed very little about my diet. Try it yourself https://tinyurl.com/yd2225sv
Awesome video 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Even dry Fruits has lots of sweets. I eat them every day but still gain lots of weight.
for lunch I ether have ramen noodles or tomato soup, is that okay?
Skipping meals and excessive exercising
Cut out soda and sugary drinks.   U will lose weight quickly

I lost a stone naturally by using an air fryer. I used that instead of frying and had poached eggs . I had this everyday but lost a stone Still. I ate God/nature made foods. My health improved has processed foods have allergy reacting ingredients . I'm going back onto it.  Don't store temptation in your home . Avoid food eateries while new at eating healthy
What if I go to the restaurant to eat the whole pizza and then I don't eat anything until the next day? Will it work?

Everyone has time for the gym,  they are just too lazy to go.
If you are a fan of spicy  food (and cooking), then you should make this simple delicious recipe. The recipe calls for pickles, hot peppers, & sunflower seeds. Chop them up and cook them together for a delicious salad. Also, only eat when you are hungry. lastly, if you are looking for a healthy snack, choose celery because it has the least amount of calories.
umm who is putting sour cream on fruit?👀👀
I can do laps on the stairs for hours I guess
I don't know what to believe anymore, on your other video says that you shouldn't eat fruits on a empty stomach  Then in this video says that eat fruits first thing in the morning What to believe?

Omg I go to a new school soon and it has Soooo much stairs good thing
I do water faster or juice fasting for 48 hours , slowly take my sweet craving away.  Now I really need to work on , take away the rice.
I absolutely despise this channel once they tell you that tomato and cucumber is a bad combination the other they recommend it(just an example there are many other factors why I hate it)
I like num 9 step ... I always follow num nine step 😊😊
Does eating spicy food makes gain weight?
Love this channel
I will start to try them all
Common sense, but as a society in America I think we've become far less formal than 50 years ago.
Actually you should avoid eating fruit for breakfast... because it will rise your insulin level,which is bad,and you will be more hungry that day... You should always begin your day with protein they can help you absorb nutrition from other food better,it's better to eat fruit for snacks
I've only been on this for three days and it's worked so well!
Me too

1. I’ve never used canned vegetables  2. I will do that... I love nuts(dry fruit is okay) 3. Mmmmm.... fruits. But I’m not a big fan of most of the fruits with pits 4. I’m terrified of stairs if it goes high... scared of highs, scared I’ll fall. But I’m also scared of elevators  5. I don’t have a Hula-Hoop 6. I barely eat desserts 7. I need my sour cream.... I like it with my takis... enchiladas, tacos.... etc. but Greek yogurt it delicious  8. Coffee😋 without creamer... 🤢 I need my French vanilla in it. 9. I can’t though.... I like to eat all the food I get so I don’t make the cooks feel bad. 10. No thanks... 11. Soup? SOUP? I’ll think about it. It does fill me up with even a 1/2 a cup of it.

B.S. Eat less calories than you need. That's the only way and it's painfull.

''As soon as we get back from the office, grab a hoolahoop instead of crisps'' .... Yeah, office is the only workplace people have. Deluded segregation is obvious with this one. Don't be surprised if you struggle with weight when you sit in your ''office'' year after year. Maybe get a new job instead.
always prefer brown rice insted of white rice which helped me loose 5kg a month
i'd rather go to the gym instead if i had to keep doing this stuff constantly
But I can still eat my pizza?                  Right 😰
It was not helpful I'm actually doing most of these .
Im hungry now
I have time...but kinda broke😂
b.
No time for the gym is just an excuse. If you can't go to the gym then do a proper boduweight exercise program.
Where is the sixpack explanation
Eat normally during first 8 hours you awaken.  Then, do not eat after that.  Or, maybe have a carrot in the evening.
I thought when she said hulo hoops as in crisps packet lol
The battle of losing weight 😫😫
How to lose weight ? Dont stuff your mouth with every chance you get, dont eat lot before going to sleep and do some excerxise even light one for half hour will do. As long as you dont get much more calories in your body than you can burn in that day it will be ok. For mentally strong ones do fasting one or two days weekly if you want faster results
"What to do if you have no time to go to gym?" "#4 Make time to go to gym"  woow
Stop eating heavy late at night help me a lot.
More basically, really keep track of *everything* you eat;  you’ll probably be surprised how much more you eat than you *think* you eat.  Slight variant on your last one there:  Eat a gut-buster bowl of low-calorie-vegetable salad (lettuce, cucumbers, celery, as opposed to avocados, for example) with low-calorie salad dressing (there are “zero-calorie” salad dressings on the market;  actually they’re very-low-calorie).
The tip about Fruit is completely FALSE. 1st of all. Comsuning any fruit is better than not consuming... Some of the best fruits have seeds and some don't have pits i.e. blueberries and blackberries are two of thw absolute healthiest fruits. Don't forget your apples. The fiber keeps you healthy and makes you feel fuller longer.
If I wanted to lose weight, I'll just start eating in front of a mirror each time.
I need to test it

ONE WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT:  EAT LESS
It's actually saying: BE A VEGAN
Diet is just a part of it but you still need some form of exercise. Sorry but the title for this video is just clickbait and is BS!
Just replace fizzy drinks with water drink plenty of water it will make u feel full quicker so u will eat less and lose the pounds
Keep you're stomach empty for as long as you can and exercise while fasted for best results.
Just eat when you are hungry. Don't eat when you are not hungry. Thank me later.

Stop watching the news, its adding more stress than it helps you. When is the last time you learned something productive from the news? Read a book instead, both calming and more helpful with knowledge and sharpens your mind

Is this channel only for women ?
She said "no time for the gym". She didn't say anything about straight up not exercising, ya bums. Of course, the only way to truly lose some lbs is to do simple workouts at home or taking the stairs like she mentioned.   On another note, I do HIIT cardio(all at home), drink ACV three times a day (cause I'm hardcore like that), I'm currently doing intermittent fasting and switched my diet a thousand times. The results of all that is showing but it's kinda slow paced. 😬
I don't even need dis I do dis  already
God Bless!
Thank you!
Stay away from dried fruit. It is so fattning
I'm sorry but no amount of apples and bananas is going to satisfy my sweet tooth. Apples aren't even that sweet and they make my stomach feel empty and bananas aren't even that sweet and they're not that filling.
I'm eating cookies right now

I am trying to lose weight. But I won't follow numbers 10 and 5. Since the only pitted or stone fruit that I really like are cherries. And as for number 5 I absolutely hate coffee. Both the smell and taste of it tends to make me sick. I would rather have tea and hot chocolate instead. As for number 6 I can very easily say no to. Since I always hated the taste of sour cream. I won't do 4 either since the only friends that I have is myself and my 2 cats. And plus I am not a member of any gym.
If you take grapes and freeze them they taste great. I like mine with honey

Number 8 is useless

1 hour is 4% of your day so make time to go to the gym
Does sugar-free ice cream count as a low-calorie dessert? I like that better than frozen yogurt. With the coffee, I take it with either milk, half-and-half, or cream and sucralose. Lean meat doesn't digest as properly as fatty meat does.

A healthy diet is the best way to lose weight, exercise is good for toning and building muscle.

It’s sad how things that’s good for your body taste nasty. but the things that taste good isn’t good for your body🤔 Why ?
#12 Use fresh vegetables instead of frozen ones or even those in cans lol they're obviously a lot better but of course if fresh ones aren't available, well follow their advice

NO! Dried fruit and nuts have the same or more calories as candy. And dried fruits are usually coated with sugar.
Tell us something we don't know 😒
Nuts are yucky
I'm sure it couldn't hurt right, I mean I already do half of the stuff anyways. I'll try and see if it was worth it

I play three sports, walk up and down four flights of stair for work every day and still have this freaking big stomach from when I broke my ankle and stupidly ate and watch tv for a month. I think once it is on it is a pain to lose, btw I am 49.
I don't think it works. I tried things from other vids and they just didn't do the job sooooo.... (still liked it anyway)
You can lose a ton of weight really fast by just not drinking water.  Of course you will need to re-hydrate, or you will die, but otherwise this method is very effective.
Brightside said fast result in 4 week... Someone, i know it might a click-bait but, if you want to take the challenge please make a comeback after 4 week... If it work, i will...       ...give you an applause.
