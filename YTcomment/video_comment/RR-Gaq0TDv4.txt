Just made this tonight for dinner, it was delicious! I bought some goat meat a couple days ago and was looking for a good curry recipe that had all the spices I have. I marinated for about 3 hours. It took me about 2 hours to cook everything because it took a while to reduce the liquids, but it turned out GREAT! Really like it. I made it pretty spicy this time, I might cut it down next time, but it is still awesome. Thanks for sharing!
Till today I’m using your receipt for cooking mutton. Taste is amazing..
Typical what ?!? Typical north indian type ?  And you call yourself a.chef ?😂😂😂😂😂😂  Is there anything like north indian or south indian cuisine ?  No !  Except.foolish labeling in average restaurants north indian thali is 2 rotis before rice and south indian thali is without rotis 😂😂😂😂😂   Absolute nonsense    No chef worth his skills will ever use these words as   There are totally more than 300-400 cuisines across india and there is no north indian cuisine or south indian cuisine  Period   Dont insult yourself as a chef by such dumb statements   Good video though

Not fair! The picture for this video is completely different to the end result of your cooking, two completely different things! It's like McDonald's serving you a skimpy burger in place of a juicy Big Mac!
Baki sab theek hai per aapne tomato puree Dali hi nai. 😥
Hey Vishwash just happen to see your recipe today and tried it. Turned out delicious. Thank you.   Was also going through the comment section and was amazed to see negative comments on accent, measurements etc. It seems internet is full of people who just want to show others down. Hope you don’t get bugged by these intellectuals. Have a good one brother. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
Why do people give videos  such as these a thumbs down???... I don't understand why... Nothing wrong here!?... 😲
Thanks for this recipe and I also love a lot ‘garlic’make the recipe more tasty
where is the list of ingridients master?
Hey man, love your recipe. Can you kindly write the ingredients? I got most of it but I'm missing a few from what you said (not familiar with indian curry powders and spices)?
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_NwVD35iANsuksPaKxmhuw please subscribe to this channel as well if you like cooking
I made this and it was the most delicious recipe I’ve ever made thank you very much I love it
Remove the fat from the pot if you are fat and need to stay healthy to not die. Otherwise if you are healthy leave the fat flavour in.
Sometimes when the spices mix it is tastier and sometimes when the spices are separate it is tastier.
you must  put the ingredients on the description. I can't hear some of the things you saying.
Bhai itne mirch se g🌷🌷d faad doge kya 🌋😆😆
didnt understand his accent...write down so I can read not talk too much...wth did he say??
Talking too much
Thank y0u..nice..👍t0m0rr0w I want c00k mutt0n curry..

Hi I Am from Georgia And got married in India . Recently I saw this video and thought  to make this recipe .

Thanks for the recipe it was really good .

Muttun hai ki masala ka soup..too much spicy bad for health
Bhai hindi me bolo ye bharat he lol
Yea....no...

Why r u using 1 whole garlic?? Petals kyu nahi kiy??
i dont why English speaking is supposedly considered as a virtue to success. Clearly English is not your comfortable language. Hindi mein baat karna, sharam kyu hain itni Hindi bolne mein!!!
Yummy
When did u add the tomato purée ?? 😧
Ok this one.... goes well with just white bread.....
It is cooking channel ,he made a delicious recipe ,in between don't bark that his english speaking style  is bad ,he is not teaching you english remember it ,if you cant encourage then atleast keep quite .
Are u gaggio martin

Nice recipe but you use pressure cooker .
U r very idiot person

you should mix tomato puree directly into the water it takes more time to cook and makes the taste bad
Nice cooking style
Yummy recipe
i just didn't understand why you put whole garlic n even didn't peel it n u even add tomato pouree at last... i mean we need a different way to cook but not a illogical way
Sir,  very  good recipe. When  curd  cooked  is it hygeni c. Please clear the doubt.
Nice👌👌
Why you put whole garlic? It should peel and crushed.
Nyc cooking
Adding hot water cooks the meat faster
Tomato ko pehle masala Dalne tym use kar sakhte kya

Cooked this today and it is beautiful.  I add just 2 whole chilli's and it suited all the family. Thank you so much for the recipe.
can you give me please all the ingredients... i can't hear them all.. 😁
Please don’t try these recipe  First of all he has used too many chilies 🌶 bay leaves 🍁 onions and other ingredients, just for only 400 grams of meat, and secondly this vedio also shows it’s too much time consuming to prepare a meat. One my friend tried exactly the same way, believe me it was taste like a hell, waste of time.

Adding garlic is a traditional way of cooking in western Bihar. There is a dish called Aahuna mutton which has whole garlic pods. This is a modified version of the same dish. You eat it by squeezing the cooked garlic, just the way you eat drumsticks/muniga

Really great recipe. I definitely wanna try this whole garlic option and that music at the end was amazing touch.

Hi Lalit I love Mutton but is has lots of fats and cholesterol wha would you comment on that?
Just a small suggestion, to save time maybe you can put all spices at once!!!

Hi I did made mutton exactly you made. And it was really really yummy....
Too much of chill. Also u put all the khada masala in cold oil when u started making this. Wrong basic rule.
so nice
Thank you for sharing this recipe   What would we do with the whole garlic? Would we remove and extract the pulp? Should we mix the pulp back?  Or should we serve with the garlic pods? The mutton juices would have gone inside the shell and enhance the flavour. What would you recommend?
tomato ?
a whole gerlic !!!!!
Thank you very much. Your cooking pan looks like a starry night sky :)
I also made this yummy recipe 😙😙

I like your mutton gravy. Nicely cooking
That looks super tasty! Unfortunately here in America, a lot of those ingredients are hard to find and usually overpriced when you do find them. I'm sure it's not that expensive to make it in the UK since it's a staple food there, but here in America...wayyyy expensive to cook that. That's why I've never got to try making my own Indian mutton curry :(
Thanks for this video. I love mutton curry and would love to get hold of the ingredients just in case I miss out anything when watching this video. Thanks !
It takes too much time.  Also you have added too much chilli powder yaaaaar kya hai

Isse ghatiya mutton receipe koi nhi ho skti
cool
hindi me bolte  hamlog to samajh rahe h  laikn ghar ki ladies kaise samjhegi

Garlic ka kya karna hai.uska pulp nikalna hai ya Nikal kar phenk dena hai.
Looking very delicious yaar....
Grandma ,I love you from USA.. bless your heart..
did you forget to add tomato puree?where it is  ..u had made that...????
An interesting method.
My mom made this and it turned out delicious n lip smacking it was a bit spicy and the mutton was pressure cooked for sometime so tat it doesn't take so long in the pan. whole garlic idea is nice it tasted well. over all a superb recipe

Hi men Pakistan se hn or mujhy ap ki recipe bht achi lgi yahan per bht se logon ny negative comments b diye hen plz ignore them and keep it up 😊
yami 2
Why we used curd..... i does not like It... so can i avoid It from this receipe..... can i use other think in exchange of curd... or not.. plz explain
he made us fool... the thumbnail mutton is different so that we will be attracted towards it but in the video the mutton is different.
Too many ingredients to make for one curry,... it would cost over $50 to buy all these ingredients. Cheaper to buy one from a take away.
nyc dear

Nice Mutton but please explain me the logic of Whole Garlic? It's awesome idea

Amazing recipe. I will try this.  Can you tell me which utensil you are using? Brand name
bhai hindi nhi aati jruri nhi english  bola jaye
There are bunch of losers out here in comments. Cooking is an art and it doesn't need a language. If one cannot cook even after so much detailed video try something else. get the f..k out of here and don't ruin other creative comments.
This video edit badly....skip the tomato step.....or after cook ...you can drink blended tomato..Dont blame  on your Grand mom..You have to listen carefully to your Grand mom recipe otherwise you will skip tomato step ..Tomato make tasty food
Thank you, Nani / Dadi... hot & lovely !  Well shared, Chef.

I've made this recipe in the Bahamas while working.  It can be difficult to find mutton in the states.  Thank you for sharing a traditional recipe.  That's also very hard to find.  Recipes lose some love over time.  I thought this had a brilliant taste and enjoyed spending the proper time to do it correctly.  Delicious.  Thanks again.  On a side note, this gentleman is teaching us in a language that is not native to him.  I wonder if those of you criticizing his English can speak any other language as well as he speaks English.  One more time, delicious, and thank you.
Bakwas recipe kuch bhe upload kar dete hai log
msale is too much but recipe like yummy..
why added powere's  like chilli, coriander ......that many times  and also water twice
hi Vishwash, is the idea of putting whole garlic bulb good? since there may be a few rotten garlic cloves inside.

whenever I made it...I lost the original flavour of mutton...how to keep the flavour. please reply
Awesome Lalitji
Sounds delicious, but dude who did your sub-titles.  They need to work on their spelling.  I would not like to put ginger boulder in my mutton curry.
Where are the ingredients written
what about doing it in  slow cooker? I love doing all kinds of recipes and I remember when I lived in Florida the first taste I had of curried food was Indian curried goat. OMG I fell in love that day with curried food!
Can you do dal makhni recipe too plsssss

Hey you explained really well ... And I tried it ... My first time cooking mutton... And mom liked it...let me tell you... It's really hard to please her... Heeehhee... Although I didn't use the curd.. and improvised a little.. thank-you
wow recipe
kadai?
how much time it takes to cook in kadhi?
BHAI Hindi bolo kya bole Sara Ka Sara 👆 se gya
mast boss
just curious... why add the whole garlic !?  Why did you not separate and peel the garlic pods ?
I am curious.. why have you put the entire garlic without separating and peeling the pods !? Plz clarify. Thanks
very good presentation well done good video
First time watch 'how to cook mutton curry" felt like tasted!
please speak in hindi
Nice recipe .. thanks for sharing
you have a nice youtube channel.
superb
haha....Jackass tried cooking coz Granma said......plz learn cooking..den learn English....n den make videos...
fuck
testy
The recipe was simple but you added too much spices. Adding whole spices and garam masala powder wasn't the best combination. One more thing what did you with the Whole Garlic.......This is the first time I am seeing such a thing.
It really helped me to cook mutton curry very first time and it was very  delicious.
Looks delicious but can you add more meat? There is so many seasonings in this recipe! Can you shortcut on the seasonings if so which ones would you suggest?  Thank you for sharing this video and your recipe. God Bless you and us all... PEACE and ALWAYS LOVE ONE ANOTHER ♡
Very good. Thanks
Appreciating Your effort of sharing.
you have added the same spice twice; once while marinating, next while cooking.U can simplify yr cooking ,which will give the same taste.
use beef next time
why you keep saying approx, approx bad english
Too good..... Tasty..... All mutton lovers will surely like it...  thanks for this hatke wala mutton recipe....
very nice....I prepared it ...so tasty....
Love this video. Thanks for sharing. One ting, did I miss when you added the tomato puree?..
nice thnaks
it's awesome
Ur dish makes mouth v much watering to grab ur dish from screen. 👌👌👍
Great dish! I couldn't hear a few of the spices you mentioned in the middle of the video. Perhaps next time you can speak a little slower? I made chicken kurma this evening, but I will try this recipe when I purchase some mutton or goat. This looks excellent. Thank you!
Sir shame on you for the subtitle spelling and grammar. It is ridiculously stupid translation.
he ghan shyam  Aryal
please upload a video in which you guide how to cook mutton qorma....
nice...I try
Mr.  Lalit.  recipe looks quiet yummy will try n let you know.
Nice recipe Lalit
hello friend please tell me how gain subscriber?. i m sub U
thank you so much frd now I get it very well how to make mutten kari I hope make other thing itams so good.
Indian Street Foods are amazing, have you seen our new street food video, no ?  Here is the link https://youtu.be/5vpCpb_FH10
The curry looks really good. I liked the choice of spices specially mace and the idea of using mustard oil and whole garlic. I agree that mutton takes approx 45 minutes and is best when cooked for longer time.. wherein Chicken should not be cooked more than 20 - 25 minutes. However I would prefer to cook tomatoes right after onion and garlic and ginger.. also overcooking garlic ginger gives a bitter taste.. instead of putting whole spices at first, I would crush them along with ginger garlic paste and put it right after I am done frying my onions paste  until it becomes golden .. then add tomato puree cook it for 10-15 minutes until it leaves oils on sides and that's how you know your gravy is cooked.. add marinated mutton to it and let it cook.. add Bay leaves and salt in end and let it cook for 40 minutes or so.. also if you need gravy boil water separately and then add it to mutton..
dangal moove
ap bate bhoht large ho nose speech
Nice recipe, I want to try once in outdoor. Happy cooking.
did you forget to add the cumin seeds?  when should i add them? :) great dish ill be using goat pieces!

The curry looks very yummy, I shall certainly try. The ingredients are simple and available in my kitchen shelf. Thanks Chef.  Just to tell you that I was watching the recipe without volume and the subtitle made me  wonder what is the cook talking about until I highered the volume and found that he was explaining well, but the spellings was out of the way.

Being a bachelor, the very first time i tried to cook mutton was a disaster. Almost 1kg of mutton was disposed. After watching this video, man i gotta admit it tastes delicious. I mean i cant believe my own eyes, though its hard for me to remember, i always watch this video and cook my meal. End of the day, my closed ones always appreciate me for cooking such delicious mutton curry. Thank you for this recipe, hope you make more videos on food as simple as this one. Cheers :)
thank u sooo much for dis recipe look sooo delicious,,, as am a Muslim we love mutton much so thanks,,insha Allah ll try
why whole garlic??
Dude !! it seems you are using voice recognition software please look at the subtitle of your video you were saying something and screen is saying something different...LOL

Two questions Chef:  Is this mutton (lamb) or is it goat?  Does the mutton have a marinade on it?
this style of preparation is the best. I have seen people made it this way and nothing taste better than this. it's good, I am able to see the whole preparation in detail. thanks.
Sure😄 good things in life takes time
Mutton loves onion...lolz

Hi Guriji,If u  r going to add cold water into the curry then the mutton will reduce its taste please stop adding water in such intervals,and what happenned to chilly and masala how many times u r going to add them is this a curry or war .Keep it simple
I've never combined tomatoes and yoghurt is my curries assuming it would turn out too sourish but can't wait to try this method out as it does look very yummy yummy ☺  Thank u for this easy tutorial and to your grandma for this recipe.   Allah Hafiz
Most entertaining video ever....the captions, I mean LOL...
he is keep adding masala masala and masala...its not mutton curry..its a masala masala curry
i think kasoori methi doesnt go with mutton ofcoirse im not expert im a house wife its my opinion will u reply plz
Rps school?anand bazar
subtitles are way off..
Like ur recipe. Understood the whole thing. totally accepted why u did all those stuffs to make the recipe tastes better. I got u. wish u good luck.
Nice and excellent effort to make mutton masala, korma. It would be tasty with chappati. Finally, he has to remove the whole garlic. I should add that if he want's to consume it with rice then he has to make it biryani.
anindita sharma I believe your sincere comments the stuff he cook looks very delicious but too many ingredients added
why you put whole garlic
lets mix mutton, all masala , oil salt, oil and cook in for half an hour, that's also a kind mutton curry. Yours is also a kind of mutton curry, but very unimpressive. Its mutton curry without grammer
ismay sirf masalay thokta raha hai yah  throughout
Great job and yes amazing food takes time.
who uses the complete garlic without peeling them???? bakwaas
not good
good job boss
u dont know to cook man
make more video please
Hi seeing your video first time and realized u r amazing and love cooking.....Great   wonderful mutton receipe really....mouth watering....but takes long time ....try to show quick cooking tips as now a days getting time for family time is toooooo busy for all  I agree good food needs time, but also good romantic time also need time after good food ...keep post good receipe i am your fan,mixie ,cooker from now on.....[ hope you catch my comedy....fan ]
that's a lot of spice powder I will run out of powder before the meal is cook
what is mutton
it doesnt look like tea spoon it must be table spoon
Why u not add ginger garlic paste
please do with beef...
tomatoe puree, saunth shouldn't be added at the end and moreover the last thing to add is mutton itself
Don't want to hurt your feelings, but I didn't find it great. I have been cooking for years and my experience says that the method is not correct. I have never seen anyone adding pureed tomato at the end of cooking and adding powdered spices in the end, when the masala is already done well, another one is adding atrocious amount of chilly. Trust me, cooking is about balance. I don't think that much of heat is necessary for 400 gms of meat, even if you say that it's supposed to be 'hot'.
All the ingredients r neither mixed well together nor the dish taste good . Jus coz u added Kashmiri red chilli powder that's y it has turned red . Really not a good one . N who adds the tomato purée at the end without even cooking it well . A quick disaster one . Ur mutton itself has not cooked .👎👎👎👎👎
We Bengalis cant imagine any Meat curry without Potato
hello Lalit can you please tell me why you add the spice powder after cooking the mutton for 20 min, generally I have seen it being added at the start. thanks for the great video
I am sure , you belong to BIHAR side, I know by seeing the GARLIC hole..:D
Look good but we don't like spicy and oily I will try
i had tried its good, thanks a lot lalit....
veryyy niceee
nice 👌👌👌
u should speak Hindi also... its more comfortable for u.
isase achchhi to hamare yanha pakodi banati hai
u should do a video with indian style pork curry
Which software you are using to create your Intro
good
I think it's a awesome taste bro really I like u r recipe
Laughing my ass out reading the subtitles. No offense bro, good recipe tho
here y full garlic is used and not cut into pieces?
hi
very nice, i will try and one more thing keep it up
who is doing subtitling for you
pathetic
Nice
The moment I took Mustard oil out it tasted great
Hiiii tell me ,, how to cook in pressure cooker
why did you add whole garlic???????
Started loving your dish from 12m14s and till then, i was just watching it to spend time.
Indian Fish Curry is also the most searched recipe in non-veg if it is prepared in mustard. So we have just uploaded the traditional mustard fish curry mom style, here is the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjKS_7xTXQ
How do you remove the smell from the mutton?
Hindi me video nahi daal sakte kya
what is the sense of putting the whole garlic ? this dish is a mixture of mutton ghotal,mutton curry and mutton rizala. but a little different from traditional mutton curry.gud logic behind not putting salt at the starting.
receipe to theek hai, but hindi me baat kar lete to accha hota..
yum! minus a lot of the spices for me.. all in all it's perfect :)
chilli is like nightmare to me😭😭
bhai hindi me baat kar shakte ho
Guys just uploaded a new recipe #ButterChickenRoasted in HD, here is link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgwmXwenevI
Its looks really tasty but u added too much of Masala...
I can smell this from Singapore. Oooohhhhh! Mouth watering!👍👍😁
this look good very good thanks for sharing the video bro
how do u get rid of mutton smell?
hi. can i use yogurt instead of curd?
