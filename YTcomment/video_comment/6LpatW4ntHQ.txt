If this brewer was for sale I would buy it!
Does anyone know what type of coffee he was brewing?
I just drive thru @ Dunkins - yummy
Fascinating ... I could watch/listen to him for hours.
I love the passion for brewing. To glean something out of a coffee that no one else has.
I like the use of cold water to temp profile. Is this accounting for heat lost through the top during steeping? Why not add a lid?
any chance you guys can do a video on tds and ex.% ?
Love Todd Carmichael! This guy knows his coffee.
Could do something similar with an aeropress and inverted method.
I hope he puts the dragon in production. Ill take one for sure!
That is one incredibly dedicated and detail oriented coffee geek. Gotta love Todd's enthusiasm!
Todd is the SHIT! I fucking love this guy!!!
Seems a little... excessive..
16 g of water for every gram of coffee. you use oz instead of grams too.
1/16 ratio - what does he mean by that?
