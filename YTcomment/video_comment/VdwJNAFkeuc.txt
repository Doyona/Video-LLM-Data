YUM!  Thumbs up!
That looks amazing, I have some left overs so I am going to whip this one up for sure!!
Cauliflower rice is my favorite these days!!
Did you add all of the spices and herbs? You didn't show this
Another good one! I just love the way you cook with stuff that I already have!
Thank you! your video's are so helpful, especially because I've never eaten like this before.
