HELLO LOVELY VIEWERS! Important Note:  If you have questions about this recipe, you can post it here for the community to answer. But if you want to ask me, please get in touch via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or my website (all links are in the description above). If you leave questions in the comments I may not see them due to the large volume of comments I receive across the hundreds of videos on this channel.  Also, before sending on any questions be sure to read the written recipe on the website as I often add extra tips and notes not covered in the video.  Thank you for watching!
Do you need any help in the kitchen!
I just made 2 servings of this exactly like you instructed and it was soooo goood. Kop khun kup!!
I love your videos thank you very much
I make this a lot 👍
Toooooo yummy !
I missed pad see ew so much so I tried your recipe and it was amazing! The taste was exactly what I was looking for. The one thing, my mistake was the soy sauce I put more than you suggested in the video 😅 it was so salty. I should've followed your recipe😂.
shes 😍
I have tried so many versions of pad see ew, even some pre-packaged sets, and always find the soy flavour is just too overwhelming and it's always missing something that I get at the restaurants, but I just don't know what that is. I was diagnosed coeliac a few years ago and have missed pad  see ew so much. I have on occassion ordered gf pad see ew at restaurants (made with the stock noodles BC the ho fun noodles are usually not coeliac safe), but whatever they leave out of the sauce to keep me safe is that thing that is so essential and it tastes like I'm just eating soy noodles.   I have gf dark soy, oyster, light soy and fish sauces, and I'm going to try this at home. I doubt the golden mountain sauce will be safe for me though. I had success with a recipe online once, but the next time I made it, it wasn't right. I can't wait to try your version!
Each time I make it according to your video, we bless you:))))), for years now!
There is something very satisfying  iin just watching Khun Pai cook egg in oil with garilc!
the resipe of the malay chinese char qui  🙂 noodles black soy sauce with beef and mashroom ?
What about the other half of the sauce?
My favorite Thai Dish ❤
First I toast the sesame seeds then I just use regular broccoli, and throw some pre-sliced carrot strips, maybe some crushed peanuts, cilantro, and i just use regular chili oil, with some Serrano or Thai peppers instead of the jalapeños I put in everything...?
I’m made this tonight, came out amazing
I love this channel so much ❤ I'm learning how to cook all these Thai dishes from Pailin and they're turning out so good, it's really awesome.
Hi! To make it vegetarian, is it better to omit the oyster sauce or use the mushroom one?
I made this to use up leftover steak and baby bok choy.  Substituted healthy noodle for health reasons.  Was it authentic?  No.  Was it delicious. Oh yes.
Y
I just cooked this tonight but using gf soy sauce.   Could not get the Seasoning sauce (golden mountain) here in Australia and the alternatives are not gluten free 😢.  I googled and found a recipe for it so made that up.  Thank you so much, it was so delicious 💕
I steam my Chinese broccoli before
Wow, I didn't expect it to be that simple. Great presentation,  thank you!
🙂
Where can I buy Ho Fun noodles?
How do you add spiciness to it?
9ปี?? ผัดซีอิ๊วno.1❤
My least favorite Thai dish
I prepared this exactly according to the recipe but used Italian pappardelle pasta instead of noodles. It turned out absolutely excellent, but will I be penalized for this 🙂
Wow, very proficient and fast and very well explained thank you very much sawasdee krab    ขอบคุณครับ from Switzerland 🇨🇭
I know this is and old recipe, but I'm looking for advice. I've made this with dried rice noodles and it's been good. Today I tried with 'fresh noodles', these are Vietnamese style noodles, found in the fridge section in sealed packes, like a half dried, half fresh noodle. I can't work out how to use them, I tried microwaving them, but they stick together, and are really tough even when stir fried. Maybe cook in boiling water before.  Any ideas?
I just made this with konjac noodles, delicious and almost zero carbs! thanks for the recipe!!
100% on the toasting of the noodles! Honestly, I just had take out from a new place and it wasn’t great and it was definitely lacking the extra toasting. Great video!
Uncle Roger sent me :)
A favourite of mine
My only concern is coating the beef with oil will block the soy sauce from penetrating the meat.
Hello Pailin, can lasagna sheets be used for this dish. Also the Chinese broccoli be replaced for Bok Choi? The noodle sheets can be cut and brushed with a layer of oil to prevent sticking if kept in the fridge. That would also help in preventing from frost bite.
Thank you for this!!! It looks so good!
Wow you’re beautiful! Oh yeah… I like your recipe too.☺️
HI,   Are Ho Fun noodles really difficult to find?   The local Asian supermarket (Naperville, IL) says the company has gone out of business and they can't get them from anyone else.    Any suggestions?   THX
Tried out the recipe today, it is soooo good. Thank you so much❤
Oooh, that umami glaze from that sauteed beef was just wasted😢
pad see ew has been my go-to at thai restaurants for years! can't wait to try my own hand at it!
Wish I'd known about microwaving the block sold noodles before I made this. They ended up splitting into hundreds of tiny bits. Since them, I've just used rice :P
Thank you Pailin! Would you make a recipe on how to make the rice noodles at home? Where I live they are not available, so I'd have to make my own. Thank you.
This was freaking delicious, the first time I've cooked a Thai recipe from online that actually worked. I would make this after a bad day at work at go to bed happy. The addition of the prik nam som was exceptional. Now to look to all your other recipes...
My first dish in Thailand many years Abo. And still one of my favourit one ❤
I’ve ate this twice at a restaurant and each time, I’ve had major stomach sick the next day. Do restaurants typically tend to use other ingredients for this? With your ingredients, I can’t see anything that would aggravate my body like it does at the restaurant.
Need to soak your pan. So black inside
How do you cook frozen flat rice noodles?
My next project. My pad pak boon fei deng came out incredible. Thx again!
i just ordered this dish last night on ubereats and love it
Have you made your own fresh fat noodles with the noddle machine? I've been thinking to make some.
❤❤❤Beauuuutiful, Awesome, Lovely, Take Care and Keep Safe Always iloveyou jjejejejejeje mwuuuuuuaaaaah ❤❤❤
This is the way.
got myself a proper wok setup at home and just stuffed my face with this. thank you so much.
The moment I put the rice noodles on the pan, they disintegrated into lumps.. I bought the rice noodle sheet at an Asian grocery store. It was a huge waste of time..😢
so sad we cannot find the noodles in belgium and i love ith so mutch
Hi! The pad see ew recipe on your YouTube video calls for 1/2 TBSP of Golden Mountain Sauce and 1/2 TBSP of Fish Sauce, but the written recipe on your website states 1 1/2 TSP of Golden Mountain Sauce & 1 1/2 TSP of Fish Sauce.  Which is the correct portion? Kindly advise. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you so much!!
Made this and topped it with thai chili and some chili crunch!!! Thank you for all your tips!
Lovely
Looks yummy.  I love it.
A quick question: why did you just not mix the sugar in the sauce you prepared before hand? (Sorry if this is nonsense to ask 🫣😬) 6:26
I never eat thai food in the west because i dont really trust that people here would do it justice (especially europeans). After trying pad see ew in different parts of thailand and essentially eating it every day i was there i think i'll stand by my choices and start making it myself
I need to try this
So cute she is ❤
At 6:26 you add what looks like refined white cane sugar. I have noticed that you have done this with other dishes as well. Sometimes you add palm/coconut sugar to your dishes and at others you add refined sugar. Is there some reason you are not adding the 'healthier' palm sugar? I realize the flavor is different, but the balance between 'salty and sweet' does not mean you need to add a refined sugar does it?
Golden mountain sauce. Got to find that as i love stir fried Kueh teow
Does anyone know what oil she is using? I know this video is old, so I’m assuming creator isn’t checking these comments anymore haha. Looks amazing!
Yummy! I was able to replicate your recipe!  Loved it!  What can I add to make it spicy?
is there a reason to not put the sugar in the sauce? would that affect the charring of the noodles?
2 gr of white sugar ? No thanks. But all the rest look pretty good :) I'll use allulose instead of sugar. It's lowering blood glucose instead of peaking it. ;) But great recipe. Especially re-heated. For a more long to digest carbs.
I love you and your channel (and your books) so, so much! ❤
What about the rest of the sauce?🙈😂
@Pailin'sKitchen Hello I live in Australia and can't find the Dragonfly black soy sauce. What brand besides that will work please?
Your recipe turned out sour and not good. Sauce proportions are not it. Big dislike.
ur more delicious than the dish
คนดูเยอะจังผัดซีอิ๋ว
Made this and tasted perfect! recommend to tenderise the beef with baking soda,
Most Thais sprinkle lots of sugar on right before eating.
Thank You!  Made the Pad See Ew dish this evening and it was absolutely delicious, the best I have ever tasted.  Your detailed description, recipe and instructions made making this dish easy and enjoyable making and eating.
Hot Thaï indeed 😉
I just made this tonight for dinner. It was so good, but I  forgot to put on the sugar and the peppered vinegar😮😊. But  it was SO GOOD!
Another Outstanding presentation !!!
does anyone know why you add the sugar to the wok instead of including it in the sauce? and if you put it in the sauce instead (as some recipes suggest) what is the difference?
I'll take this dish over any pad thai.
I appreciate your channel for sharing Thai cuisine made easy , Hope you'll feature a Filipino dish infused with Thai twist just my idea, been a subscriber for a long time.
I love your authentic Thai recipes. I especially love the one on making the perfect noodles! Wow! I gave up on many noodle dishes because the noodles would break and everything looked like yuck mushy!! Thank you for your guidance as I rediscover these recipes. Concise and clear with no BS! Love it.
Sorry, I don't agree. I'm not Thai but I have lived here for 28 years.  Most places today don't make proper pad see eu due to the fact they're trying to speed up dish preparation.  The BEST pad see eu occurs when the chef FIRST stir fries the wet noodles in a bit of oil and dark soy sauce, until the sauce carmelizes into the noodles.  The noodles are then removed, the rest of the ingredients are stir fried (meat, then pak kana, egg) then noodles re-added and additional sauces.  What sets this dish apart is the noodles taking on the molasses flavor of the dark soy.
Made this today. I was sold 478g of kway teow, and had run out of oyster sauce and had to sub with something else, but it was all good. Cooked in two batches like you advised and this was a golden tip, i even managed to execute a wrist flip for the first time! Second attempt was better than the first because i knew not to prematurely take the kway teow out of the pan and give it more sear. However, it clumped up because i moved away for a few seconds. Next time, i'll know to give it regular flips. 😂 i am so excited that we can actually achieve wok hei at home!!
This recipe is a winner. Yes, you need black soy sauce and golden mountain sauce. Doesnt taste the same otherwise!
Lovey  foods
Thank you CAT female, lovely dish.
Where can you find the noodle sheets?
you are so special
Hi, Can the noodle be frozen?
Newbie learner here.  Watched lots of Chinese Beef Chow Fun videos. Your teaching style is very good and relaxed with the extra details. Pad See Ew is the Thai version.  I agree that the larger flat rice noodles ( slightly singed ) is better in the Thai version. You were made to be on camera ... ha ha .  Thanks !
See Ew is Teo Chew language  (豉油)
Pad See Ew was the first Thai Dish I ever ate, and to this day remains my favorite. This recipe was perfect!  I've tried many recipes over the years and none have even come close to this one. WOW!! Where has this channel been hiding..... Pailin is a wonderful,  gracious, awesome teacher. The black soy sauce is a game changer!  Thank you Pailin.
Your smile makes my day
There is Meal kit set under Thai Aree brand Pad See Ew Meal Kit, right now there are food importers in LA imported it to sale there.
This was my favourite dish as a kid, albeit the Chinese version, made this today, came out great! and so easy! it's just a little tough to find the Gai Lan and the proper noodles.
Very yummy
nước mắm.. do you have good recipe?
Glad I found you
you're pretty :)
This is. Really my favourite..  I remember i ordered the same pad see ew in sm in philippines.(thai reztaurant)..what funny is. The looks. Is. Looks pad thai ..and i said its not my order. Cozi ordered. Pad see ew ...pad see ew. Has. No beans sprout. But phad thai has ..  And far. From the taste ..what sometimea annoying is. They make their own  atyle. They said. Which i. Dont  need. Bcoz i went to thai restaurant. To have the authentic thai recipe ..not the filipino style ..
Sometime pad see ew. Sometime if you sneaky enough, pad don’t see ew.
I can’t find the ho fun noodles anywhere so I just use the common linguini rice noodles. Not ideal but close enough for me.
I made this tonight, getting close to great, need to get less salty soy sauce like you are using. Thanks for your efforts to bring us this lovely recipe!
3:18 If you can't find those noodles, then look for the knife cut noodles, made from wheat. They also hold up better to frying and tossing.
ทานกับซอสพริกก็อร่อยนะคะ
❤❤❤🙏
I made this tonight and it really is a lot better than some pad se ew'a I've had. It is always a hit or miss. I'll for sure be making this a home from now on. SO good! I didn't have the Golden Mountain Sauce and there was no difference in taste.
the golden mountain sauce is available on Amazon.  I ordered it and it came in 10 days.
I'm gonna try it..
I think adding the remaining sauce mixture is missing from the video.  Thanks for posting.  This is favorite Thai dish along with ground chicken basil chicken. Ty!
Hi Pailin, my parents are Thai and my mother is a trained chef but my Thai and my mom's English are almost equally bad (don't tell her I said that, I'm pretty sure she thinks my Thai is sh!t), which is why I highly appreciate your videos; especially this, which is my favourite dish, which I've also never dared to request for my mom to teach me, because reasons.  Keep doing what you do, Godspeed! :D
This is my favourite Thai dish, and second is obviously red curry chicken, then 3rd is Laksa.....
Can kecap manis be a substitute for Thai Black Soy Sauce?
2 tablespoons + teaspoon: why not just say 7 teaspoons
Very awesome recipe for pad see ew 👍
Awesome! Thank you. Tried it, loved the recipe:)
My favorite noodles and you nailed this dish. I tried it and now I do not need to travel to my local restaurant when I want this dish… just amazing! Yummy… very yummy!
Looks delicious!  What is the Thai name for Drunken Noodles?  Any dish with the wide flat noodles is great too.
My mouth was watering 30 seconds into this.  Going to have to find the rice noodles here in Guadalajara Mexico.
Wow. So Pad See Ew is my favorite thai noodle dish and our local place closed/relocated after covid, and I don't want to drive across town for take out. This is spot on. I was able to find fresh noodles at at a Korean market and have the sauces mostly she recommended. Wow. My family was like this is restaurant quality. Thank you!!!!
Can the sugar be mixed with the sauce, or is it important to add it separately? Thank you so much for your recipe!
You're adorable. Thank you for this.
Wow History pan will good taste Thai dish I love it 😊❤️
woo
B s o good
Large onion pieces
Hi Pailin, your recipe is good, I should try to cook it coming weekend 👍👍👨‍🍳👩🏻‍🍳
This is great! I really appreciate you being so thorough in your explanation! Ive never seen such a proper version explained!
awesome as always :)
재밌게 봤어요^^ 부디 한글 자막도 만들어 주세요^^
Look delicious thanh you so much 👍🥰❤️🌹🙏
What happened to the other half of the sauce?
This is what I bought a wok burner for
I’m really hungry after watching this..thank you 🙏🙏🙏
Wow 👏 delicious 😋
It shouldn’t be ew at the end. It should be yum. 💀😂😂😂
If I’m using dried e fu noodles should I cook it separately first ?
This is one of my favorite Thai dishes. I finally decided to look up a video on how to make it and this was the first video I found. I’m glad I found it. Great video. Can’t wait to make this at home.
👍done nice racipe and amazing Sharing full time watching Like your recipe thank you so much for nice sharing 🌸💕👌
Would the oiling trick work with other proteins like shrimp or chicken?
อร่อยมาก การันตี  ถ้ามี ราดหน้าด้วย ครบเลยครับ อิอิ
Hi Pailin, please tell me a way i can cook my pad see ew noodles so it doesn’t break apart when i cook them? Because my first time cooking them and the noodles broke apart 😭🤣
Looks so good.
Love.. this menu!! Very easy..but very good. Take care.. Thanks..
I live in Vancouver too. Can you please tell me where you buy the rice noodles in sheets?
Menu of my mom.  When I'm young. 😋😋😋
This is real Thai style, confirm by Thai people.👍😁🇹🇭
soooo coooolll
I love those glass prep bowls.  Where did you get them.
Could you share all the picture of the sauces bottles so we can pick the right one . Pad se ew is my favorite food .
I SOOO appreciate your tips for those less familiar (e.g. what to look for i. The Chinese grocery or if we can’t find x then use y but use less of z”
I like noodo
So good! This is my favorite dish ever when we go to Thailand :) I'm gonna make some right now :) thank you for the refresher :)
Omg  im  here  again ...after  a  year...its  my   fave❤
Thank you. I am making Pad See Eu for the first time for my daughter who loves this dish.
So garlic goes in before the egg
Good 🌅 morning 🌼
3:40 "stick together" sounds like a recipe for the skin of  wanton, crystal dumplings, soon kueh, Vietnamese spring roll...
Does anyone know if those noodles are gluten free? Thinking about making this for a friend but they can’t have gluten unfortunately
I wish there is a way these manufacturers can make these sauce bottles in smaller sizes, enough to make the recipe.  I’m sure there are people like me who usually do not repeat the same recipe.  Purchasing these large bottles will just end up sitting in the cabinet until they turn get old.   I can’t tell what type or brand I should get,  there is just multiple types of oyster sauce, dark sauce, light sauce and soy sauce, fish sauce, paste here and there.   It is very intimidating.
what wok are you using?? all i keep seeing are the nonstick ones with coating. looking for something that i can use a metal spatula with and not scratch.
Hello, the black soy sauce made by Dragon Fly is not available anymore, which one is the next best brand?
My noodles keep coming out soggy, please help!
Just made this and OH MY GODDDDD it’s amazing!!!!!!!! I instead double the sauce and then add two green thai chili and it just gave me more of an UMPHHHH!!! Pailin is honestly the only thai cuisine recipe youtube channel that has ALL of her recipe Good. It’s never a hit or miss with any of her recipe. It’s ALWAYS GONNA BE GOOD!
Food Porn.... I love it 😍  Any recipes that include Sigha infusion?
What was the first soy sauce
sucks to be a diabetic
I love pad Seuw
When you add 1 tbsp of "soy sauce", is that any particular kind of soy sauce? Is it just regular soy sauce like Kikkoman or is there a Thai soy sauce that would be better?
You 've got the point, The toastiness is the icon of Pad Se Ew (I just realize this, as a Thai ... It 's some kind of embarrassing. 😅😅)  while the chewiness by spending more time in stir frying noodle represents the characteristic of Chinese fried noodle.
Hi  I am your viewer from India and also running a thai small restaurant  tied up with Zomato  I am very fond of thai quick recipe I want to really know how to make KUCHAI  which is a street snacks  It’s a request to please show step wise how to make.
Hi this food Thailand my favourite  food
That looks soooooo good 😋😋😋
Such a solid and super delicious recipe, this is the 4th time I've come back to make it.
Thank you for sharing  good dish my son favorite.
What an amazing recipe!!! Thank you so much! It is our favorite Thai dish, we could not believe how good it turned out!!!
Wow! You’re a little cutie 😊 and a great cook 👩‍🍳 Thanks for the tutorial. I just inherited a new wok from my Brother. I’ll have to give this dish a shot 👌🔥🙌🏼 😋
Golden mountain sauce should be in everyone's pantry also (Maggie).. The dragon fry dark soy sauce brand is like soy sauce with honey. It's sells at thai store .
how do you keep the noodles dry as in not sticky and wet?
Pad See Ew is one of my favorite food.  Thanks so much for this video recipe.
好味
I tried thia recipe...really good! we live in Thailand for 4 years..aside from Pad Thai..this is also one of our family'a favorite.❤
Helloooo Pai. This is absolutely my favourite dish. I eat it all the time in my most favourite restaurant Raad Nah Bangkok in a small side street in Chiang Mai ( my second home). Thank you Pai four the recipe. Greetings from the Canarian Islands!
Some people also let the eggs get nicely fried so you get that crisp egg texture within the softness of the noodles
I love charred noodles
What are your thoughts on mixing kecap manis with Chinese dark soy sauce, to substitute the Black soy sauce?
Looks yummy! I just found the wide noodles in a 500 g, block and I've been fighting to separate them so thank you for the microwave tip. I'll try it next week along with this recipe. I retired to Bangkok 18 months ago and cook almost all my meals at home. I'm adding to my Thai repertoire every week so half my meals are Thai food now. I have to cook them three or four times to be able to remember how but sometimes I still have to refer back to your video to keep it authentic. Great video, great food. Thanks.
The only youtuber i trust for southeast asian recipes
Duck has got to be the best meat for pad see ew
I love that you explain everything. Thanks for uploading! Can't wait to try this!
I learned how to eat pad see ew adding vinegar frm my gf who is thai.
You remind me of Promise Tamang
Can you please do some gluten free meals
do you have a video showing the difference between Prik Nam Pla vs Prik nam som
My favorite Thai dish. Thanks ❤️
oh those toasted noodles look amazing!
It's quite similar to what we call Char Kueh Teow in Malaysia😊
May I ask, which soy sauce did you use?  Thin Thai soy or mushroom Thai soy?
I really suck at stir fry noodles...I think I need a proper wok because my noodles always stick and washing is a pain in the a**.
I love any Thai noodle dish. Thai food is pure magic.
My favorite noodle dish in the world of cuisine anywhere. It's hard to get fresh noodles where I live, so I dont' make it for myself, but now that you've told me the trick about microwaving them, I know how to get them apart. Thank you. I've tried doing it in warm water with no success. It turns them to glue. sigh
2 oyster sauce + 2 soy sauce + 2 dark soy sauce + 1/ fish sauce
It's easier to watch when the person in front of the camera is so easy on the eyes.
LOVE, Love, love PadSeeEwe Broccoli stems are amazing! In America nobody eats them. I like them better than the florettes!!
You are very beautiful and sweet girl;) thank you for sharing!!!
I made this twice and both times came out super dry and tasteless.  Not sure what I am doing wrong since I followed the recipe
Love it
A vegan version perhaps?
i love discovering new human beings that cook nice delish looking foodskies. can't wait for my wok to arrive so i can phoc shiet up in the kitchen and wok all over the place with the delicacies
The name Pailin reminds me of Cambodia..? Anyway love your cooking and thanks for sharing.
I made this and it was amazing! Thank you for helping me satisfy the craving following everything was super quick and most def the difference in flavor for me was the Thai black soy sauce!
This literally looks like the one I used to have downstairs from my apartment in Bangkok on ซอยสวนพลู8 years ago. Makes me miss my former home! 😭😭😭😭😭
Ohhhh I miss Thai food every day..staying in Bangkok for 36 yrs...lovely place....friendly people.....
Will try it
in indonesia we call this Kwetiau. and. its. so. good.
It's so tasty.
Do you ever make the noodles from scratch?
I love Pad see Ew my favorite
Ho Fun ✨💕👌
Loved this dish and loved the video!
What would you say other than the spiciness of Pad Kee Mao , is the difference between Pad See Ew ?
I made this one for dinner. I’m impressed I made it! I didn’t follow all of the ingredients but still achieve the taste I want.   I used oyster sauce, black soy sauce, fish sauce , brown sugar, and pork belly for my protein...  Thanks for sharing!
Thank you!!!
Dear Palin. Over here in The Netherlands i can't find Dragon Fly Black Soya Sauce.   Shall i use the Healthy Boy Black Soya or the Healthy Boy Sweet Soya Sauce instead ?
Thank you for this video. I am going to try this this week. I have already made many of your dishes. My favorites are the steamed fish and green curry chicken, also the soups. Couple of quick questions.. 1. Can you please recommend the store bought noodles brand? I get so confused not knowing why there are so many different noodles in these stores. 2. How long do you toast the beef? Was that Sirloin steak you used? I only heard Sirloin. Thanks in advance
looks good, makes me marry you...... and you are beautiful.... happy new year
Made this tonight and it was fantastic, restaurant grade A! Thank you so much.
Just made this and now having it for dinner whilst writing this review and omg it’s so bloody good!!! Only one restaurant in my area makes this dish so nice and I have been wanting to recreate it and I have finally found it thanks to you! I used kechap manis + Chinese dark soy sauce and half the sugar amount. I added capsicum carrots and long beans!
What about the dry noodles? How you cook them?
Wow. No, not the food.
Not only the food is good , But you are so beautiful as well. Thanks showing all the ingredients.
Yummy 🤤
What about the other sauce?
so why did you wipe off the oil that you cooked protein in? isn't it better to just keep cooking in the same oil since it will hold the flavour of the marinade/coating and plus you're cutting down on oil.
i went to a thai resturant in rhoad island a long time ago and had this dish, i couldent remember the name of it but only what it looked like and ive been searching for it ever since...first meal i ever had chopsticks with now im hooked on eating everything with chopsticks, its been 5yrs but i finally found it thank you im gonna go make it now
I always get this whenever I go to Thai restaurants!
Omg I can’t believe I pay $15 for this and it’s so easy to make
Golden Mountain Sauce is pretty much just Maggi seasoning.
Great dish! My second favorite Thai fast food after Kau Man Gai which I don’t think I am capable of cooking it myself 😅
Hi Pai,... appreciate if you  could share the Recipe for Making Thai Rice Flakes which is used in Thai Kuay Chap...Thank you
Excelente recipe Pailin!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😘
How i luv this smiling chef. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe. I always like ur detailed n clear explanation n suggested substitutes. 👍👍👍
Hi Pailin, does the palm sugar get spoiled? mine had specks of white spots, does that mean it's bad now?
dried ho fun works a lot better than fresh ones...
Am I the only one who hasn't found a soy sauce they like other than LaChoy? I used to buy Chun King. But I haven't seen that brand in years. I don't like Kikkoman soy sauce. And IMO,  every other brand I've tried taste like Kikkoman. Anyone else?  Almost everyone thinks I'm crazy cuz they can't taste a difference in soy sauces. Only other person I've ever met who can, is my 14 year old daughter. Who is just as picky about soy sauce as I am.
I made 3 times now, im getting better.  Thank you for this great video
Now I know how to make my favorite Thai dish! Thank you, Pai! :)
Made this today and it was deliciouse! Thank you for the nice and easy recipe!
My favorite Thai noodles recipe for sure. I love Pad See Ew... I’m cooking many of your recipes during Pandamic, and this is the next one.
I made my own home-made rice noodles by your recipe and it makes the whole difference. I cook the pad see ew many times With The rice noodles I bought from grocery store and it’s not it, it’s not the real thing . the real thing it’s the white  racing with! Thank you so much for sharing your amazing knowledge technique and little secrets of the Thai cuisine.
I have make this. Hope I can find the noodles
I just tried thai food for the first time yesterday and I'm in love 😍🥰😃
Wow I want to have some
can you show us how to make Kao Moo Dang Moo Grob sauce please ?
You are one of my favorite YouTube cook. I have tried so many of your recipes and they always turn out perfect. My husband and my kids really love all the dishes i made from your show. Please keep them coming. I love them. Thank you.
Love it and how you teach even the cutting! Great tips! Thanks! Could you please consider make a vdieo on drunken noodle and khao soi pleeeease?:)
This is great ! I've made the recipe now a few times and it's almost perfect. I struggle getting the char on the noodles though. When I let them sit, often times the noodles will just stick to the wok instead of charring nicely. This is over medium high heat, using veggie oil.  Any ideas on what to do different?
Beautiful.
craaaaaaaaaaaap. I went and got all the ingredients but FORGOT to pick up the Thai black soy sauce (I'm lucky to have an Asian supermarket 15 minutes from my house that's the size of a freaking walmart. It's a massive blessing). Now I gotta go back tomorrow to grab the ONE ingredient I forgot...uggg
Everything I make from pai tastes great. You’re the best.
THANK you!!🤗
I've made this twice. I cannot believe how simple it is. A new staple in our home. Thank you
Thanks for this tutorial. Now I can make my favorite Thai dish. I’ve made it twice this week 😅
Has anyone actually cooked this according to the recipe? I thought it was really bland and lacked depth. I'm going to try to double the sauce recipe. I followed the meat, gailan and noodle amounts exactly. I used cast iron and got great color on the noodles...just bland.
I have never made Thai food on my own but wanted to give it a try. Since Pad See Ew is my favorite I followed this recipe. I also watched Pailin’s other videos on the guides of basic Thai condiments to learn what to get to start cooking Thai food. I tried today without much confident and it turned out really great. I can’t believe how it tastes exactly like the one from restaurants! Thank you so much for the great recipe - can’t wait to follow your other recipes.
Thank you for the video ! How would you make it with the dry noodles ? Because in Europe they are the only ones that are available.
Gut pad see ew
It's the charred smokey noodles that make this dish.....
I made this today along with your homemade rice noodles recipe. It was SO GOOD. thank you ❤️
This is one of the clearest, most informative cooking videos I have ever seen (and I'm a cookbook author). So helpful. I've made pad see ew many times (it's a favorite quick dinner) but this shows how to make it even better. Thank you!
I lived in Thailand for some time and I always buy this in the food shop. When I got back to the Philippines I havent found any place in the city where they cook pad see ew. Luckily, I saw this! <3
Ahhh now I understand why it’s never quite right when we make it at home haha. Gotta have the right soy sauces and make the noodles more toasty
That wok has seen better days... I think it’s time to replace it...
She speaks beautifully! (in contrast with the other host I bookmarked)
Tasty 🥂🥂🤠🤠
I’ve made this a few times and did tonight. I improvise a little. Can’t get Chinese Broccoli so I used broccoli rabe. For beef, I used ground beef and like it. Delicious!
Thanks so much I have to try this
holycow, amazing.
I love this dish Pai!  It is so tasty.
I review this fabulous recipe each year at the start of outdoor woking season. So delicious! You don't need catch-on-fire heat for this dish, but it's still more fun and less smokey to cook outside.
Is the dark soy sauce sweet or salty?
Pailin, this is the third pad see ew recipe I have tried. All three of them tastes the same so maybe it's the traditional version, but its not the flavor I'm used to eating at thai restaurants in Los Angeles. I know Americans Americanize many ethnic foods  to our taste buds so is that what's happening here?  Or maybe it is because the pork or beef bring most of the flavor? I dont eat meat anymore so I dont know if that's what is killing my dish
When i wanted to try something from the Thai Cuisine there was no-one whom i could find to teach us the recipe this channel has all the recipes :)
We tried this recipe and it was GREAT. These are the absolute best video tutorials we have watched or tried.  Thanks !
Pailin how do you cook the dry Thai rice noodles?
My noodles keep breaking into tiny pieces even when I fry one portion at a time. I use a wok too. Please help ? I’ve attempted to make pad see yew 5 times already. I buy the fresh noodles and seperate them into individual pieces by hand.
Thanks to you, this dish is so much easier to make! Aroy mak ka!
Can you use Maggi seasoning in place of the golden mountain sauce?
And wheres the kai dao? 5555
😋🤤😋🤤😋🤤😋
This is only noodle dish in the world that I add a packet of sugar when being served.
Thank you Pailin for all the tips on how to cook everything. I absolutely love everything you cook.
Pad ped please!!!
Thank you for this! Is it possible to use Indonesian sweet soy (kecap manis) instead of dark soy?
Made a variation of this because I didn't have all the ingredients and it was great! Thank you!
That was fun to watch and look so good!
I cringe so hard every time I hear someone say "PAD SAY UU".
Thank you for your recipe. I will try it tomorrow.
🙏🙏🙏🙏👌👌👌👌👌💖💖💖💖😘😘😘😘😘😘😛😛😛😛✌✌✌✌✌🌈🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆👈👈🎈🎈🎈🙌😁😁😁😁😁👌👌👍👍👍
I used to always make this dish with homemade noodles (see Pai's awesome video on how to do this), because I couldn't find decent pre-made noodles for it.  That can add a lot of time to somethign that's otherwise a very fast dish, so I decided to try it using plain old dried rice noodles (same kind you use for Pad Thai, but the widest I could find).   It came out great.  Instead of just soaking them like you do for Pad Thai, I actually boil them for about 4 minutes, which makes them softer,  like the consistency of the steamed noodles normally used in this recipe.
Made this today. Veggie pad see ew. It was so delicious. My mom said it was better than the restaurant 😹
jeez she's beautiful.
What noodles is tbis
Took 5 years to finally find your great video on  padseeew,  one of my favs, wife and I both love when they burn the noodles (you call toasted) as it adds so much delicious flavor.  Sometimes does not happen when they are in a hurry. Thanks for making us hungary.
I love pad see ew!!  My fav  item to order!
ooOooOo!  Soooo yummy!  I can't wait to try this!  How are those noodle sheets sold, in the fridge section?  Thanks for your detailed instructions and explanations.  You are the best!  Your style is perfection!
so you didn't cook the noodles, just fry them for 1 min???
Pailin , thanks so much for showing us how to make Pad See-Ew . This is my kids favorite Thai dish. You make it look easy. Can’t wait to try.  Pias
We're going to try and make this ourselves, THANK YOU! <3
Thanks for second dish I learned from you.
What distinguishes Pad See Ew from Pad Thai? Is Pad See Ew more similar to Singaporean Fried Kuay Tiao or Beef Hor Fun noodles?
What is that type of pan called?
Golden Mountain is the best!
In all my years of watching Thai cooking videos, I have never been required to use these two odd soy sauces. This makes i very hard for most of us to make it. Looks good but will never make.
hello, any recommendation how to get a good wok like yours? Thanks!!
I’m literally looking for the recipe for an hour already and I can’t find it
Cannot find these noodles in store or online..... any suggestions??
i made this , its great , thing it tends to be a little salty, need to balance the soy with  maybe lemon ?
where can i find the sheets like that? any ideas in san francisco?
Wok hei is the key :)
Anyone here think she is hot beside me
Food looks delicious going to make some today
Such a GREAT preparation of this dish! Love that you explain the charring technique and why it’s so important to the flavor of the dish! Awesome production as well. Just subscribed! Great channel! Cheers!
Awesome recipe thanks
You put a big smile on my face. I love your energy and enthusiasm
To anyone that cooks this, try a slice of lime on the side to squeeze over the whole dish after it’s done. It takes the flavor to a wholeeee different level.
Wow i love it!
Ooooh no don't throw away that beef juice that's where a lot of the delicious sticky salty natural caramelisation comes from, from the meat itself. Instead take out the beef when ready, (set it aside) leave the beef juice in the wok and reduce it with a tablespoon ginger juice (if you like) some sugar until it becomes a sticky yummy that will coat the noodles rather than soak into them,  the water content will have evaporated. Then toss in noodles and cook as normal. Some people also sprinkle a teaspoon corn starch on the raw beef when they cook it, this turns any juices into a nice thick consistancy that will also just coat the meat. Retain the natural beefy goodness.
Thank you for sharing,  I need to make this.  It looks so Aroy Mok Mok!
Made me hungry, great video. 👏👏👏
Lovely recipe. Thanks
Good lord your beautiful!  I speak very good English also but I'm brown village Thai.. a fat man.. cant cook.. and not very beautiful... lol Love your videos!!
Is there a substitute for fresh noodles?
Khun Pai, what can I use instead of Chinese broccoli? Anything close to that?
Hi Khun Pai, just came across your videos and I'm in awe!!!! Having lived in Thailand for 23 years, now recently have relocated back to my own country (India) & I along with my family are missing "aharn Thai" so much!!!! I could recreate these lovely dishes (ofcourse,  with the help of your videos) but some fresh ingredients are so hard to find. So, I'm kind of disappointed. But your videos are so inspirational that I'm going to hunt for what I need. No pain, no gain.
Where can I find these cute little prep bowls with the pour spout?
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOR YEARS <3 <3 <3 thank you so much, theres a little restaurant in Ban Nam Khem in southern Thailand that I frequented daily for months and their pad see ew + tom kah gai were my two favourite recipes but everytime I've checked one out on line it wasn't explained as efficiently as you have here, cannot wait to try it out! Thank you!! :) p/s putting like an excessive amount of fresh lime on this dish with a little bit of the chili vinegar is to die for/ A MUST. <3 <3 <3
you season the meant before you put in the oil
GOOD JOB!
I don't know who her husband is but he's a lucky man
Is ABC sweet soy sauce Kali man is the same as dark soy sauce?
this is one of my favorite dishes i will try to make one day. thanks for sharing.
This looks so Delish and doable!  Thank you!
Hi! What is the name for dish very same to pad see ew, but more like soup?
Definitely my favourite Thai dish. Thank you for the excellent lesson.
Thanks for the recipe! If we dont have fresh noodles here, can we use yhe dry version? Shall it be cooked before?
thai basil?
🙏🙏🙏
How do you increase the level of spiciness? What ingredient do you recommend to alter
The clearest explanation so far!!  What can I use for those that are Shellfish and Crustacean allergic? Oyster and fish sauce will harm me.
Lots of good, practical advise.  Thanks!
Anyone know the brand of rice noodle sheet shes using?
What brand if noodles is she using? I can't find it :(
Having some tomorrow.
I love the way you make. I gonna try to cook that . I want to know the recipe of Pad Thai too. If you have the link please share me.
If you ever go to Chiang Mai the restaurant Yok Fa does a fantastic Pad See Ew!!
How do you get your rice noodles to toast without sticking to the bottom of the wok?
So all this time I've been using the wrong noodles? The dry ones?
You are so charming!!
Made this for dinner tonight and it turned out perfect! Just like my favorite Thai noodle restaurant!  Thank you for sharing your recipes!!
Thanks for the recipe. This looks awesome. I was just wondering where I am able to buy the noodles, I guess I will try the Asian store first and see if they do carry them. Thank you again.
I’ve been married to my Thai wife for 17 years. She worked at her aunt’s Thai restaurant when I met her. They used to make Pad See Ew and I didn’t know how good it was until I tried the dish at other places in Thailand and out. It was always good but never like they used to make. I made this version tonight and my wife is eating it as I type. She keeps looking at me with a little smile and a nod of approval not knowing how I did it. Thank you!
Sooo love this dish, that's why I came here for.. I know your pan is clean but it looks sooooo disgusting.. lol
Thank you this is my best Thai food
this is Hot Thai Kitchen...I have a Kung Fu Kitchen....HHUUAAAAAA
I love Pad Seew over Pad Thai. So glad to see you make it. I like to sprinkle crushed peanuts on top once cooked and in the bowl.
Very nice pad
thanks for the clip!
Pat see you make pad see ew.  Thank you, I'll be here all week!
I will have to try this, I love cho fun!
Awsome job...although I would have put chili oil on top.
can you show me how to make pad kee mow??? thank you for all the great instructions Pai!
I had these flat noodles with chicken just once, by chance, in Chinatown, Bangkok during my short visit! I absolutely loved them. I spent a few months figuring out what they were called etc. But, this video just cleared all the doubts, I had. Thanks for posting it. I am going to try this recipe out today.  On a side note, you are an amazing cook. Loved your style and detailed presentation. Marry me, i am a foodie. (sorry just being a little cheeky at the end, or not ;-))
Amazing explanation of the Ho fan!!
Sauce: 2 tbsp oyster sauce, 1 soy sauce, 1 golden mountain sauce, half fish sauce, 2 black soy sauce. 2 servings
You are so BEAUTIFUL 😍 thank you for sharing
I love this video. Thank you for posting:)
Thank you from 2019 👍
Where can I get the Soy Sauce you use in Los Angeles? Having a hard time finding the brand you use or a similar dark soy sauce.
Love your cooking.
The sauces are Chinese brands
What did she do with the other half of the sauce mixture?
the explanation about the noodles is not very clear.
The best Pad see ew gai in Thailand has to be at Bobs restaurant near Regents International School Pattaya.. miss it to bits 😭😭
no basil?
I’ve always made my own version of this dish, but it’s nice seeing how it’s actually done!
Hi  Thanks for this. Can you tell me what burner you are using for your wok? It looks like this one: https://www.amazon.com/Iwatani-Corporation-America-35FW-Metallic/dp/B00522F2R2/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=wok+burner&qid=1567897408&s=home-garden&sr=1-10
She is a babe
Love your personality and you’re so pretty too!🤗
I can’t even think of 8 millions things
Thanks for the complete explanations of things.
Mmm.  Any one else is chewing on their Pad See Ew right now ?
If you can't find Golden Mountain sauce, I find Maggi "Seasoning" to be very similar. Its available in most North American grocers. Might be next to the Worcestershire sauce, might be in the Asian, or even the Mexican food section. Not exactly the same, but I think its closer than just doubling the soy sauce.
I always had it with broccoli carrots and cabbage and mushrooms u dont have to get the asian broccoli also I always used red soy sauce it's real thick and u use sauce
I made Pad See Ew, HUGE success!! Outrageously delicious!!
If I’m making a party tray, should I still cook 1 serving until I fill the tray?
Oh my goodness you are my new favorite channel!! We love Thai food and are actually going to Thailand for the first time later this year. But I can’t wait for for Thai food so we want to cook our own at home. Thank you for creating such a great channel!
What kind of knife are you using there?
HELLO LOVELY VIEWERS! Important Note:  If you have questions about this recipe, you can post it here for the community to answer. But if you want to ask me, please get in touch via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or my website (all links are in the description above).

I like eating this with calamari. And adding chopped lettuce for an extra crunch.
she likes her noodles FATT, hmu
this is my  favorite thaifood. from china
Great recipe Pailin!
What about beef juice being wiped off.
do u have recipe for the chili vinegar ?
Love at first sight 😚😍😍
She’s a great teacher, wow
What is this big noodle called in Thai language?
Yeah, that's hands down my favorite fried noodle dish🤤
In your book, the recipe for Pad See Ew calls for 1lb of fresh noodles. I don't have access to fresh noodles and I want to use the extra wide dried noodles I have in my pantry. Will soaking half a pound of dry noodles achieve one pound rehydrated noodles for a good ratio in this recipe? Thank you in advance.
Love those noodles!  Thanks for help in my kitchen!  Winston-Salem, NC
Mmmm, that looks so good!
I can say the premixed sauce is including dark soy sauce(sweetness)+kikoman soy sauce(flavor)+light soy sauce(saltyness)+oyster sauce(thickening). You can relace oyster by adding corn starch into the mixture, it makes your dish just less sodium. And just before you turn off the stove, put in 1 cube of nonsalt butter will make your dish more delicious.
I’m addicted to this dish lol, every week I’m at the Thai restaurant for my pad siew on take away...🙂 gunna try and make it myself next. 🙂👍
What is the difference between the blue cap and orange cap dragonfly sauces?  What does it mean when a bottle says double black soy sauce? Is Koon Chun a good substitution for the Dragonfly brand (import prices are crazy)?
Yummy!
You NAILED it.  I've been experimenting with Pad See Ew for years.  Never got the right caramelizatrion on the noodles.  Just never quite made it all the way, but YOU NAILED IT!  Thanks so much.  Enjoying your other videos and the website.  Thanks!
Maybe add the marinade before adding an oil. Drives me crazy when people do the opposite. Otherwise you’re adding a layer of oil that prevents the marinade from adhering to the protein.
Made for family.  They ate it before I was able to take picture.  Didn't have gailan, substituted with cabbage and preserved radish (salty version after soaking in warm water to remove salt).
I wanna try this recipe! Your instructions are so clear and makes so much sense! :)
Hello new subbie here and I wanted to know what types of seasoning to use if you want it very spicy not regular spicy like black or white pepper or cayenne pepper but Thai spice?
I admire your staged technique with your dish. It  definitely clarifies some missing areas of recipes I have attempted.
Thanks for this! Whipped some up for lunch and it turned out great.
Excellent presentation!  The best pad See Ew I've had was in Nakon Ratchisima, near my house  OMG, it was so delicious!  Yours looks delicious, as well, and I'm going to try it tonight.  Khob Khun Krap!
She's so cute
MY FAVORITE
Your videos are so fantastic!
American-Thai food😊 easy made
Where can we purchase the fresh noodles?
Love enjoy watching your videos and LoVe 💕 Thai food 🥘
Just made this and it was so good! I have followed other recipes for it and never gotten that classic taste. Thank you
thai food look delicious everything
You're my go to for all things Thai! Thank you so much! My favorites are stir fried noodles pad wood sen, pad see u, etc... so far :-)
NOTHING beats a lady that knows how to cook and is still astonishingly beautiful, for a wife, thats a lifetime keep. (just wonderful) thank you so much for the tutorial and tips.
I love this dish! Can you make it a shirt? 😁
In my top 5 favorite dishes ever.
When a beautiful woman cooks I am always ready to learn
I had to scale this to feed 5.  Didn't go over so well.  The package of noodles was 28oz.  I used two big bunched of Chinese broccoli and three chicken breasts.  I wonder what's the best way to scale this up so you maintain the flavor?
This is my favorite Thai food dish!!! Yummy!
Why do you have to speak with so many hand motions. Very annoyingm
Favorite
Instead of Pad Thai, I think maybe I will try this recipe first since I already have all the ingredients and sauces I need.
Hi,  Quick question, what brand of Thai black soy sauce do you use?
YUM
Can you please tell me where we could buy these rice sheets from which you cut up the noodles? And for how long can you keep them in the frig? Do you need to wrap the rice sheets with plastic wrap or.....how do you store them in the frig? Thanks please tell me.
yep one of my favorite dishes in Los Angeles and in Bangkok... thanks for the recipe.
Thanks for the tip about the microwave on the noodles that come refrigerated and hard, makes a big difference trying to deal with those suckers. I've made your recipe many times. It. Is. So. Damn. Good! Thank you!
Pailin you are absolutely the best!!! This is my favorite Thai cuisine and I bought all that sauces and follow your step by step and its so yummy !!’ Thank you so much!!!
Have tried cooking this today and followed exactly as per your show. It came out so delicious. Thanks so much!
The two most important ingredients in this dish are a gas burner and a heavy wok.
I love your cooking. I'm trying to find black soy sauce with orange cap but I haven't found it. I see one with blue cap which you said don't buy and then white cap.😏😏
I tried this recipe for lunch and it was delicious! My friend hates restaurant pad see ew for some reason, but he liked this one! Next time, I'll add less sugar since it was a bit sweet for my taste
i love your recipes! Can you make Pad Ba Mee, I get it from my local thai place! Stir fried egg noodles w. bean sprouts, baby corns, onions, mushroom, Napa, carrots and scallions :) I'd love to get the recipe!!!
Hi Pai!  Shout out from Richmond, BC!  You have inspired me to cook more Thai food.  My wife loves spicy food so she is real happy:)  This Pad See Ew recipe is great.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I substituted the beef with pork tenderloin and some Chinese sausage.  It was yummy!  I really love your tip about letting the noodles char a bit.  It really makes the dish.  The chilli vinegar was interesting.  I've never use vinegar on Pad See Ew before so I wanted to try it.  I didn't have white vinegar so I used Japanese rice vinegar.  The vinegar taste was very mild so it didn't really have much impact on the dish.  Maybe it was the type of vinegar I used.  The only thing I would like to improve is the noodles.  I was only able to find the pre-cut rice noodles at my nearby TnT, and you are right...they are too thin.  The thin noodles falls apart when you fry them.  Any suggestion on where I can find the uncut noodles you use in your video?  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will definitely make this again.
Been trying to get this recipe right for years now. I think using a wok on a flat top stove is what I'm doing wrong.
I love your videos! Made this recipe tonight
One of my favorite dishes!
How much sugar did she put
What else do u like FAT N LONG
Thank you for Recipes  ka.
she likes her noodles extra thick =)
I ain't ganna lie but I'm more interested in her 😆
the best!!
Yum
One of my favorites!  Thank you!
Pad see ew isnt pad see ew without charbroiled smell/taste. Thats hard to archieve at home with9ut a fire grill
I love cooking and you are just way too cute lol... Thanks for sharing your recipes!
Thanks for your video. Will try this!
Wow nice video!I just subsrcribed.,nice to know you should be in the Martha Stewart kitchens.Looking forward to more!🇨🇦🇨🇦🇺🇸👍
The soy sauce you use is it the mushroom soy sauce? You didn’t show the bottle
Mm
damn wife material
Question: Why not mix the sugar in with the soy sauce?
Did I miss something? You only added half of the soy mixture. How about the rest?
I like that you’re straight to the point with great tips along the way. 👍
Looks tasty!!!
she s awesome but i would assume she forgot the other bit of the ancient secrets
If it's hard to find fresh chow fun could you substitute large dried rice stick noodles and soak them? Like the ones you use for pad thai, but wider. Is there a way to partially cook them so they have the same hydration as fresh chow fun?
LOVE IT! cooking it up right​ now!
Dear I’m gluten allergic so what I substitute the dark soya sauce and black soya sauce with and how much ?
Thank you look so good I am hungry. Oh you r beautiful too
Great tip with the rice noodle sheet
Oh yeah
Why the wok so dirty?
I crave this 24/7 man 😍
My noodles stick to the wok and thus do not toast.  Bummer.
Wonderful technique. Thank you.
Just made this! WOW It took less than 4 minutes! Flavors are perfect! I had extra veggies. I ended up throwing them in. It added to the time by 30 seconds to a minute. Still came out great! Thank you so much! I look forward to watching more of your videos!
Mmmm looks delicious and another beautiful Thai dish to add to my repertoire Thank you
i’m confused your online recipe said 1/2 tbsp fish sauce but then beside it in parenthesis it said (=1/2 tsp fish sauce). what amount do i use?
Your version is the only with enough char on the noodles
Ok now I am hungry
Omg Pai... this literally brought me back to Ayutthaya. I can still remember the delish that is Pad See Ew and it became my favorite Thai dish! (too bad I forgot the resto/hostel’s name! It’s just beside Wat Mahathat, so anyone familiar please do let me know cos I’m def going back 😁)
THANK YOU
Yum, wish I could get sheets of rice noodles. Thanks for the recipe
So happy i found your channel. I love thai food and i've been wanting to learn how to cook it for myself at home.   Now this pregnant woman wants some pad see ew :((((
Pad See Ew is delicious. I just had a spicy one yesterday. Now I'm sitting on the toilet shitting diarrhea everywhere and it smells bad but it's worth it.
In Bangkok street food I think the wide noodle is Sen Yai?
What is your main sauce ingreidants for this meal?
Thank you!!! You're amazing.. Boy did I need this site,😗😗 if you can tell me a way to make the thinest seafood muchroom I would truly appreiceat this, I had a bad experiance with them, however I do like the flavor. Sincerly Shawnalee Young
You are so gorgeous and the food you cook looks yummy. Are you married?
I like using thai sweet soy sauce when i make my pad see eww
Looks amazing.  Cant wait to try!
You are so beautiful
Dirty pan
My FAVORITE
I've been making this recipe at home a few times, and it's the closest I've gotten to restaurant style pad see ew. The main tweak I've made is that the sauce actually needs to be doubled for the amount of noodles. Next time I try it I want to use less oyster sauce and more black soy sauce.
Every time I cook this dish, I allow myself the pleasure of watching this vid beforehand. Mine usually comes out pretty well but I wish I could be a guest taster in Pai's studio when she records Pad See Ew II !
Love your cooking you are amazing cook 👩‍🍳
You’re beautiful.
It looks like a one-million-dollar pad see ew!
What kind of gas grill is that? Does anyone know?
This is my favorite of all the thai food.
Tried this recipe - its OK need to improve seasoning
Can this be made with mama? I used to get pad mama from a food truck in college but the taste sounds more similar to this dish
Besides being an awesome cook, you are just too cute for words!
I need to make 5 portions for 5 people. Would you still make 1 at a time?
sexy
This is my FAVORITE DISH😁😁
Excellent. Best recipe and demo of this anywhere. First one I've seen that makes sense. Thanks.
Where can I get the noodle sheets?
OMG, lookin good - itz the best noodle dish, itz my goto everytime i go to a thai restaurant.
I've been craving this for so long, but can't seem to find the wide noodles anywhere! =( Could only find the Taste of Thai straight cut noodles!
WHAT A STAR--CHEF, TASTE, BEAUTY, COMMUNICATION, JOY. ALL THERE. THANKS!
I am just worried about the beef not properly cooked
Oh wow! This recipe came out soooo good! Thank you thank you thank you, Pailin!
Omg i lived in Thailand for 8 years and always loved eating Pad see ew!! Seeing this made me realize how much I missed it over the 2 years since I left...  Thank you so much!! I will look around my area to find the ingredients I need to make this soon!!
Girl, I wanna eat everything you cook 🙂
whyd you make all that sauce and only use half instead of just halving the sauce recipe and using it all
Add a lil fish sauce to yo chili's at the end, and salt, and you will have some goodies.
Wow, what a wonderful vid about a wonderful Lady making a wonderful meal ... and she eats it with a fork!  Wonderful!
Looks amazing. I want this dish so much right now but even though I'm in Bangkok I'm too hungover to go out and get it.
Is this the same as drunken noodles?
♥️♥️♥️
Just made this and it was amazing !!!! No more Ordering it from the restaurant! It’s so much cheaper to make at home! Thank you so much for your recipe soooo good!!!
Another great video.
I actually prefer the noodles really soft not chewy. So that they will almost melt in your mouth.
Genius tip for the noodles! I’m going to try cutting my own noodles from a sheet!
Hi, those noodles get bad quickly do u know how to keep it from getting old fast?
What da heck is white pepper
Yum, that burnt noodle looked grrrreat
Ah! Finally I know what see ew means! In Cantonese, we say “see yau” which sounds very similar to see ew!
chhob maak aroi aroi phad si ew...👅
great job - that brown sizzle is the key, sauces too. one of my all time favs.  always look and order from food stalls in Thailand
Looks delish!  I love watching you make Thai food... you explain everything so well...  I always wondered what is black soy sauce, why do I need it... well now I know.  You are doing wonderfully at teaching us how to make delicious, not to hard Thai dishes!  Thank you!!!
น่าทานจัง
super yummy.
what's the difference bet. the orange and blue caps? :)
So I was right. I alway find a bit insulted when restaurants make this with broccoli. Hahaha
She is 102% Thai with a 2% margin of error
Can I use Ho Fun noodles
I love you.  I like how detailed you are with your instructions
Hi! I love all your recipes but I have a question! Every time that I have made this one  the noodles taste kind of dry! What do you think I am doing wrong? Thank you!
yummie
why does american cooking seem so bland and boring... this is great food and i love it
i see you have several dishes you cook the meat slightly before then remove and add to finish after, love that tip and method, i can't say ive seen that anywhere else... i can tell you i've made 10 or so of your dishes, and love them all.  What I don't see is what here is called fresh rolls, wrapped in rice paper... served cold... am i missing a video????  THank you
Do you use a separate burner because it's easier to record or the flame is stronger, better for wok cooking?
I would like to try this, but I can not find the noodles
I think she split the soy sauce mixture in half.  What happened to the other half of the mixture?
Looks delicious. Would it work with chicken and sambal-oelek?
Looks so delicious :o
I looooooove pad see ew! This is the best recipe video on how to make it and I've watched a bunch. I love how you explain how the char is important and that it makes the dish. You are sooo right. Great job!!!
lovely dish, but it is a shame that you dont use the lovely meat stock, at least add it when served on the plate.....
amazing video!
Hi pailin.... i am a new viewer of your videos and I am loving it.  However, I noticed something....did you promised that you will explain why you need to split the cooking in two batches and you said you will explain why in the latter period of this video... i waited for it but you never explained why.

I like to watch your videos twice lol

Thank
Hi Pailin! First I would like to thank you for introducing and sharing wonderful thai recipes! I come from a small european country, and fell in love with thai kitchen!Thank you for teaching me how to make the best green curry, so friends and family can enjoy asian cuisine.Wish you all the best, you truly beautiful inside out!
i love kai lan it taste so good
loved it!
can you show us what kind of soy sauce you use because there're a tons of them, thank you
Can we get married and cook together haha 😂
You are so beautiful! Are you Chinese or Thai? I just discovered your channel. Made my day!  Btw, what kind of gas burner is that? I have an electric stove, and it is terrible for wok cooking. I'm thinking about buying that kind of stove!
Have anyone try making this dish please let me know how it turn out. Thank you.
Delicious dish
Love the food you make....
Tried preparing this dish last night and loved it. It was a little tuff finding the same ingredients but came close. Do you recommend an online store to purchase the sauces? Thanks!!!!
Ur speaking sounds so clear and easy to understand. Also l love ur lovely smile :-)
What are those noodles made from?
"they cut them too small and i like my noodle fat"
Dark soy sauce is kecap manis!!!
I have American broccoli growing in my garden. I know it is not the same but can I use that broccoli leaves and stem as you do? Is the flavor smilar?
Is it bad if you cook the pad see ew in a large pan?
One of My favorite thai dishe! I always order it with shrimp and spicy 🌶 thank you for showing us how to make it at home (:
I love this Thai noodle dish, but always fail cooking this at home. Your instruction is excellent! Thanks. Hope to see you one day on Food Network.
this looks so good🤤
I come here to hear you talk. Your English is so good!
This woman is gorgeous!
maybe can you do a video showing the ingredients you will need first?
can you put more of the bottles of what you have? Sorry I don't have time to actually watch all the recipes now but I'm just kind of looking through.  it helps to show the bottle because then when I'm shopping I can find it
If I leave a really nice comment.. maybe you will love me?
Excellent video, I have learned so much about Thai cooking from you.  Do you have a restaurant?
Where did you get those small glass bowls with a spout from?
Look good.
i just love ur cooking.. the way u explain every detail is so helpful.. love u
I am slowly working my way through your long list of videos and really enjoying them.  I have already adjusted my Pad Ka Pow and Pad See Eew recipes and find your mix of seasoning better than what I have been using.  I made Pad See Eew just about a hour ago  using something closer to your recipe and found it much nicer than what I had been doing, but unfortunately I just went to your web site and scanned the ingredients, without watching your video first and I missed the whole step of getting some browning on the noodles.  I'll have to think about how to do that because I tend to make a lot at one time so I can feed both myself and my 19 y.o. son and have some left for breakfast, in one go.  Hard to get the pan hot enough with all that to get the scorching.    I cook this and several other thai dishes in a carbon steel wok that I have been using for at least 35 years.  It is completely black and works really well.
Hhhmmm...so yyyyummmy...
look so yummy
You are so cute! love you! Thank you for all your recipes, they are very details and practical. 👍
This was so good! Your directions are spot on! Your recommendation to have everything prepped ahead of time and to cook one serving at a time was the best suggestion, because like you said it does go fast! We drained the beef in a colander which worked well! Thank you so much!
Hi Pai,  I have never seen the flat noodles you have used, the full sheet, here in Toronto. Even in Vancouver. Which version do you use?
Thanks to you Palin and this video i can make tasty pad see ew for my family and friends any time. i have tried other videos but the dish never turn out great and delicious like yours.
I can't find these noodles anywhere! When I ask for Ho Fun noodles at asian markets they seem to laugh and not know what I want?  What brand do you use ? so I can order them direct. Thank you
catch this motheefucking subscribe! good shit!
Where can I buy those big ho fun.   I really don't like small ho fun
I miss homeeee!!
Made this dish yesterday and it was very delicious !!!  Thank you :)
fantastic demo! thanks nong Pai. na ruck jung.
Absolutely delicious!!!!!
where did you get your knife, please? I would like to purchase
Dam... Ive been using Kale all this time - I had no idea it was supposed to be Chinese Broccoli. How do you say Chinese Broccoli in Thai please?
thank you so much for the tips and tricks!!!
I can't see the written recipies
Hi . I cannot get Chinese broccoli . What's the substitute ? Hope I get an answer soon
This is my favorite Thai dish. Could you make a low carb version of this with zoodles?
Omg!!! I love Seonkyoung Longest's version, but why didn't I see this first!! I love how you explained everything. It's so informative and look so much more authentic.
I recently found your videos and have loved them! I have successfully done two recipes. Do you have a video on how to store the sweet radish for the pad thai or the sauces in general? I want to make sure I am storing them properly.
Simple and easy. The best recipe I have tried so far. Thank you for sharing!
omg im so thankful I found your channel!
your recipes are so easy to follow and your personality is so pleasant!! thank you for sharing your cooking
she talks too much. i lose interest.
Hi, Why do you add white granulated sugar and not palm sugar??
YOU ARE AWESOME !!!!! THANK YOU....EASY  TO FOLLOW AN YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE HAVING SO MUCH FUN !!!!
I like how you present your dishes, I am one of your fans, I am trying to learn more about Thai cooking, I am in the US , originally from Indonesia , Francisca Wong.
Love the tips !!! So important.
@Pai : Is Black Soy Sauce is mean Kecap Manis in Indonesia ? Because it is Sweet not the Salty one like Pearl River Dark Soy Sauce, right ???
oh my god. be my wife.  you are so beautiful. I love Thai food. Thank you.
This is going to be my new Christmas tradition. Thank you for making this simple and do-able. 😁
Can you be my cook forever? So I don't have to keep going to thai restaurants.  😍
Can you tell me where you bought your wok, Thanks!
Looks so good. I will have to try it. Thanks so much. I always order this at Thai restaurant instead of pad Thai ....my favorite. May be some basil would even better.
aloi mak mak..
Are you full Thai? You look more Viet to me.
Awesome video! Thanks! Love Pad See Eww
Yummy
GREAT VIDEO. 😄😄thank you for the great cooking class!!!!
It looks so good!!! And I'm assuming that See Ew is from the Chinese (Teochew dialect) word 豉油 which is pronounced exactly the same as Thai (豉 or See means soy and 油 or Ew means oil), since there's a lot of Teochew immigrants living in Thailand.
It looks like kwetiau goreng, makes me super nostalgic... Wonder if the ingredients are available close by, doesn't seem to be too hard to make~
Thanks for the tips Pai. We get the fresh noodles here at the market in Chiang Mai but we've never done the "spread them out and put in the fridge" trick. Awesome.
do you have a recipe for noodlessoup ??  i love you you make nice cooking videos
New subscriber! i can't wait to try this.
Made this today! My husband actually liked it too! He's from Ireland and really picky haha! The cap of the black Soy Sauce gave me a huge challenge, didn't know it was a cork type, I was twisting and twisting. Had to use my teeth! Haha!  I love your videos and cookbook!! 💕
Thanks for the recipe and detail step by step instructions. I tried this recipe couple times and it turned out great. I have the same wok and burner. They are good investment. My apartment smells though after cooking it. But my wife and daughter love it. Thanks. Great video.
This looks sooo good!! Definitely gonna try it!
Great recipe. Tried it tonight, however, when toasting the noodles in the wok, I got them pretty brown and toasted, but it had no wok hei. Is this because you just can't do wok hei in a home kitchen or am I missing something?
I love this dish!!! I'm going to the market right now!!
Pai, Your show is so appropriately named.  I could watch your preparations all day long.  Beautiful demonstrations. Thank you.
excellent dish and I can eat all the time.  Hot Thai Kitchen rocks.
your food is so delicious and you are so beautiful
I can not find this vegetable in my country Is there another one fit with this dish with similar flavor please
Is your black soy sauce same with sweet soy sauce (Kecap Manis)?
I've never seen the eggs added so early. Usually they are added after the noodles so they coat everything.
Is it possible to make large amounts of the sauce and store it for a long period of time (obviously containing it well, within maybe a jar or something)?
Now I know why they call it the "Hot" Thai Kitchen.
I like it
The best Thai food I ever had in the world .. Was in Central California at a hole in the wall restaurant.. It was better then the Thai food I had in Thailand .. Actually the cooks are Laos and Thai they are also from Thailand
I prefer pad see ew mama 😋😋😋
I actually have a question for you my family and I would go to this best Thai food place we always eat there although the last time we went there we got pad see ew, but the last time we got it it tasted like green tea and the other just did not taste right can you please tell me what they did wrong because this never happened before
So yummy thank you for your video ,that is my favorite dish, I think I can make it now
I just found your channel I love thai food and now I can make it myself this is so cool!
Hey quick question about the black soy sauce, at my Asian grocery store I saw both the orange cap and blue cap for sale. While I noticed u use the orange cap I've seen that the Thai restaurant I like uses the blue cap instead. What exactly are the differences between the two?
Ecxcellent chef who teaches the trick and trade how to make the perfect dish
I just made this for my nephews and it was a hit!  Matter of a fact, it was better than the restaurant food!  Thank you!  Lisa Rubi
this nails it! reminds me exactly like the stuff in Thailand! also used your recipe for ho fun noodles - just perfect! and yes hot Thai kitchen indeed! does what it says on tin!
You are pretty.
can you get that nice char flavor if you use a normal nonstick pan instead of a wok? also would making this without oil help add to the "char" taste?! Awesome video!
It must be very tasty without a doubt. Good show!
I'm drooling here. Thanks for sharing the recipe!! <3
You remind me of a friend I had from Laos. She was beautiful, a good cook and a breath of fresh air. I think your food looks so good because of your attitude. I love your videos. They have allowed me to lose weight. Thank you. My wife says Thank you too. Keep the vids coming.
I'm in Thailand right now and I'm popping out to get some after watching this
I love love love this dish. Thank you so much for sharing...I'm going to make this dish very soon. All your dishes are yummy! Thanks
I just made this tonight. So good! Your recipe is easy to follow as well. Thank you!
Hey Pai, do you have tips on how I can substitute fresh noodles with dried ones? I followed the instructions and soaked them for an hour in cold water, but they were still too chewy after I stir-fried them, so I had to add more water in the wok. Is that the right thing to do or should I have soaked them longer, in warm water, etc?
is there a reason why you didn't add the sugar in with all the sauce to mix it first?
You are great Krub
Just subscribe to your channel and seeing this video late at night just makes me crave for some pad see ew :)
Thanks for the recipe! My difficulty is in getting that wok hot enough to char the noodles on an electric stove. What is this burner that you use? It looks portable!
I just bought a lot of the fresh noodles from the grocery store but I may have went over board and bought five. How do I preserve the rest from going bad because I know I won't use all the noodles.
Thank you!! 😘
Hi Paulin!! I recently got married in Koh Chang, and being back  now for just over a month i have had this sudden post vacation depression from not being in beautiful Thailand! We were there for a little longer than a month &  i really did a great job in indulging in all the thai cosine, everyday, 4 days daily! I managed to stay away from western food for the whole trip this time! Finding your channel has really inspired me to start cooking Thai myself, and i just made your version of Pad See Ew for me & my husband.... oh my!! We really had the feeling of eating authentic thai food! Im so happy to have found you on here, i am going to try every one of your recipes!  Thank you so much again!!!  Dani & Vinni.
girl, you got technique! cook on sistah!
I know this dish as beef chow ho fun
Looks fantastic! Love your latest version out today, Christmas, with chicken too. Will definitely be trying both.  Have a blessed Christmas and thank your for these consistently amazing recipes.
YUMMY!!!! Pai! Love your show:)
I love this dish.  I order it all the time.
ewwwwwwwwww!!!!! love it!
Nicely done...
น่ากินอ่ะ หมายถึงแม่ครัวน่ะ ฮิ้วววววววว
amazing video. amazing food and amazing tips.
what cut of beef?
FIRST! (minus 26,337.
THIS IS MY FAVORITE MEAL EVER!!!!!! =) THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
My favorite noodles... :)
Made this on yesterday, so good! Thank you for the updated recipe :)
Can we use the dried noodles if we don't have the fresh ones? Which brand do you recommend and how would you prep it? Thank you!!
All Thai restaurants in HK serve this dish!! And that's what I always get when I eat at a Thai restaurant! I guess I can make it myself now.
Pai, what kind of wok were you using in this video? Was it carbon steel wok by Joyce Chen?
What happened to the remaining sauce ? :) ;) love you chanel !
pad see eew, next one on my hit list! great vid😀
I love pad see ew <3 aroi mak mak kah
ชอบมากครับ ติดตามมาหลายปี :) อาหารน่าทานมาก
Pad Se We is one of my favorite Thai dishes. This one is extra delicious 😀
I love veggie Pad See Ew even though I'm not a vegetarian. :)  And the only condiment I add is A LOT of white vinegar. ;)
Soy sauce ของคุณไพลิน คือซีอิ๊วขาวรึเปล่าคะ
what's about sour curry for the next episode?
Finally, I can get that unique Pad See Ew taste that I love. I have tried for years to find the right technique by watching videos and reading cookbooks. The taste comes from not only using the right sauces but letting the noodles and sauces sit/cook for 15 - 30 seconds. This caramelizes the sugar and creates that addicting flavor.  Thanks!
this looks amazing.
Love this dish. Great video :)
really like your channel!!
Excellent video, camera and cooking just keeps getting greater and GREATER.  Cheers,
Looks delicious!!!! Can you please tell me what wok you are using? it is not stainless steel is it?  Thank you!
I love those noodles
I only can find the blue cap " sweet soy" at my local Asian market. will it taste bad?
I tried this recipe today and it was delicious! Thank you!!!
The Mountain sauce really adds a nice enhancing flavor.  Hadn't know about it before this series of fabulous episodes. AND YES!  It's easy to eat WAY TOO much Pad See Ew
14th Comment!!!
This dish looks so delicious !
Hi Pai, you should season your wok, noodles will taste even better.
Looks great...also love your dishes, yummy...
What is the difference between the noodles in this video and the old one? In your first video, you said its better to use the noodles fresh, the same day we buy it. But in this one it seems we can put it in the fridge without any problem? By the way, I often make your 1st recipe of pad sew and it's so delicious! I also tried your tom yum fried rice, I love it!
Absolutely Awesome recipe.. I live in Bangkok and went and bought the fried rice noodles.. Some people suggest soaking the dried noodle in hot water and u suggest cold.. I m confused .. Please help.. I need to make it for lunch tomorrow 😊
Thanks for the inspiration!
My favorite thai dish.. I alway order this dish everytime ☺️
Yum, my favorite non-spicey thai food.  Love the taste when the wok is smoking hot.  great chaser for som tum poc poc.   thanks.
wok flavor..WOK HEI!!! awesome video Pai!
My mouth started to water.  Now I'm craving this.
Guess who's buying Chinese Broccoli tomorrow from the farmer's market just because of this video? MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Imo the cantonese style is more delicious
Thanks for making an updated video of this recipe - it's one of my favorites! I just have two questions... 1) What are some additional brands of the dark soy sauce that you would recommend, especially in the states? I have seen 'sweet' soy sauce in Thai markets that looks dark and thick but i'm not sure that's the one. 2) I notice you don't use dried noodles much, is there a reason for that? All I have access to are the dried variety, which I guess leads to me to ask - is there a certain way you would cook the dried ones (maybe al dente) before adding them to the stirfry?
looks yummy  !
I am a HUGE fan of charred noodles!
my faaaavorite! and yes, pad see ew reaally needs the toasty bits. i cant help but to order this every time i go to my favorite thai place, theyre the only ones who do thai food right that I've tasted in nyc so far :)
I will be doing this one for sure. Thank you very much!
Kub koon mak ka for this video! My favorite dish!!
you dont boil the noodles? you just put it in the pan?
What was the soy sauce you were using in addition to the black soy and golden mountain? In your original video you were using light soy sauce is that still the case here? And if so what brand? Are you using healthy boy?
I've been waiting for this video oMG I'm so excited
Nice one looks great
watching this making me crave for char kway teow >_< with the chili on the side
can you find the noodles in T&T?
Thank you so much for redoing this recipe in a better quality video!!! <3
Love love love pad see ew!
wow looks really good! I have a question tho can you please tell me the name/brand of the soy sauce you use in your cookings? i bought the Kikkoman soysauce with the green cap(less soduim) but it doesnt add any colour to my food at all and not much flavour either, what do you reccomend me to buy? Also does the vegetarian oyster sauce taste exactly like the real oyster sauce or not? Thank you in advance! :D
I imagine this might work well if I use liver instead of beef. what do you think?
That looks super YUMMY. Gonna try it soon.
Good Health and Good Tasty Yummy 😁😊
This is pretty funny.  Whenever my mom made this I always thought those toasted noodle bits were because she accidentally let the noodles sit for too long. Now that I think about it, I did always like having some.  Never even expected it to be intentional, turns out I've been making it wrong all this time!
nice update. Intended to make dish this weekend 😆
I call them happy fun noodles...  yummy!!
I love your  show...  I really think you are Food Network worthy.
Mummy Mummy หนูอยากกินปูผัดกะหลี่ crab fried w Kari powder plz mummy .
Would you be so kind as to explain the difference between the dark soy sauce with the blue cap and the one with the orange cap. I have been using the one with the blue cap?? Thank you in advance for your reply. :)
Is it absolutely necessary to use a similar style wok in your video in order to achieve maximum "noodle toasting" or would a non-stick wok work as well? It's hard to find the non non-stick woks round here.
definitely will give it a try but with different noodles as ho fun is not available in my country.
น่ากินมากๆครับ
