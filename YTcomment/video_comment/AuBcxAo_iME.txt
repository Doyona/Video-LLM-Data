Good recipe. Next time ask the mariachi band to wait until you finish your video.
Explain how you got the cake out of the pan leaving the top still raised so high just like it was in the stove please!  This is the way I like to leave my pound cake as you have it.

Waiting for you to slice the cake to see the texture
