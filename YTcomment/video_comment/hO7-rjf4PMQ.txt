Urgh! You can take paper instead or plastik foil.... that is vegan at least!
Ma solo ora ho scoperto questo canale? Proverò a farlo, fighissimo!
Bro is salami master
And what it's saying in bird speak? "Beee mik int ov tah nap gok nin kep eeeep eeeep bzzzzz"  Ie. Zip!
I bought one and tried hard. It didn't work.
Non capisco come farlo funzionare, mannaggia!😅
Latix gloves works too 😅

DiGiver  The Italian MacGuyver

My wife blows my salami but it doesnt sound like that
I like my salami natural and uncut. It whistles much louder when I blow on it
Oven cleaner and glue and metal washers 😆  I'll make one from silicone
How long can it take someone to fully knows how use whacky whistle?
Whacky Whistle copied this and is selling the item...
What a waste of salami!  I thought it was part of the whistle which would be edible. and wouldnt last.
You will invite many birds to came to you, like that 😆
Kfktl
Brother how to place it in mouth?
What can you use besides salami skin?
I did this but superglue stuck to my tongue.  Now everytime I talk I whistle ?
Should have string to avoid swalloing
There is something like this for sale online, but I think it’s a scam. I ordered some and they never came.
Grandissimo!!!
I know it works
Pls give me an tut on how to play it
🗿
he is speaking in ancient turkish
I don't understand how, I just can't do it! no matter how I change the position of the plate on the tongue, there is no result🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖

아 살라미스킨이 없어서 못함 ㅠ

I don’t have paper cups but I have plastic so I hope it works
Nobody: Absolutely nobody:     Not even a bird:     Me: *sqeaky telephone noises*
Hi, Can you make horse sound?
yum...pork intestine covered in oven cleaner, dried, then folded and glued. yeah i'm not putting that in my mouth just  to sound like a bird. not to mention you show using superglue that is toxic to humans and has safety info thats says the following.  "Hazardous components to be listed on the label 2.2. Label elements Ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate Warning: Warning
I have done very similar with Stodoys designs.
And every one you make is unique
Omg tysm
i like your scissors
I can whistle like that without that shit
Excelente 👍
Is there  Any other way.... Because lam Indian hot dog cover is not available please upload any other way on you tube
I didn’t know you could spray your hand with oven cleaner. Perhaps Russian people are just tougher.
https://www.ebay.com/itm/164113401139
😖he didn’t clean the metal part
Youve removed the protection of the salami
I kept seeing this thumbnail in my playlist and was like, why the fuck is salami involved?
No More On Ebay?
how loud is this? I need to make one for my choir song called "The Circle Of Life" (The Lion King).
Oven. Cleaner.

What if my salami has no skin? 🙄
E parla in italiano 😭😭😭😭
*You can use the clear see through paper window on an office envelope my dad used to rip it out and wrap it around a fine tooth comb to make bazuka whistles when i was a child😁👍🏼*
You're confusing the birds with your gibberish whispering.
Awesome instruction. Thanks for posting.
Sounds like telephone
Non sapevo avessi cambiato bandiera
*furries have joined the chat*
So basically make a cancer lollipop for more than the cost of buying one online. Mmkay no thanks.
Instead of salami, you can just use one of them plastic gloves.
can't wait to try this!
Ok Man Do I really have to go buy a salami and do all that first step. I'm sure there can be an alternative. I don't have Salamis just laying  around other than my husband's...
This is so cool! How do you figure out how to do these things?!  Bravo
They use to sell those when I was a kid. U can drive people crazy with that shit
I'm here because of Telephone
Wow i want that to call wild little birds.   :)  You are so good in havin this such great idea   :)

أنا ابغا واحد ماهر عبد الله الزهراني في الطائف

Who else Is a furry and was thinking of Telephone lol
Perfect for Angel Dragons.

Could you use wax paper in place of the salami skin
dem lips
Chicanos in L.A has been doing this in the Hood without any tools, Color Blind
Oh I'm going to my lical park to mess with peoples heads.
Telephone.
Oven cleaner on sth you put in your mouth

I made it by myself. I used Woodprix woodworking plans for that.
yay! I can be my Dutch angel dragon!!!!!    wait I don't have any thing
Dutch Angel Dragon fursuit, here I come!  Please tell me I'm not the only one
Instructions unclear; accidentally ate a bird and then drank birdbath water and bathed in it.
my dog went crazy hearing you
Anyone else here for an angel dragon noise?
So what are these types of whistles called? I see them often enough to assume that they're called something?
could you use something else than  that salami plastic thing
I need to make one for my fur suit
any one else hate salami
I think that envelope plastic that is clear to show the address can also be used if salami skin isn't your thing.. I haven't tried it but it did look quite similar.
way cool! used to get those in our Christmas stockings! O my gosh, now I can make them..cool thank you so much. 🙃
how did this guy figure this out? He was just like, "Oh yeah, i'll just get sum of my salami and my cup and sound like a bird!"
Do you really have to use salami
EXCELLENT...
oven cleaner on something you're going to put in your mouth?! yeah, those kind of chemicals are ok...lmao
Very good,Thank you for the video
Wow perfect . But please can you tell me what is the difference between this whistle and the wacky whistle . I did the wacky whistle (instead of salami they put a peace of gloves rubber) but the sound was different .In  your whistle , is it because the texture  of the salami is different from the gloves . Best regards .
gross!!!
remove the skeen of the salami
NEXT: ....how to make your lips rumble fast together like that.
Ooooh, so that's how Telephone (it's a character) makes those sounds
I and my friends are going to troll our teachers with this xdd
*what can we use instead of salami skin?*
The other tutorial didn't work so I am going to try this  is anyone else using this for their fursuit angel dragons anyone ??
i came here from the curiousity of Telephone's voice-
those sissors are ugly af
what do you need salami for? couldn't you just use  light grade parchment or even a latex glove? & the ridges & washer steps...100% unneeded (+ Metal in your mouth like that...not the best feeling,sooo...I'd avoid that...)
Who come here from ino89777's telephone bird squeaks sound?
Or you can run to Wal-Mart or sporting goods and buy a turkey mouth call.  $5.00
Any substitutes for the salami skin?
who else thought it was made of metal be honest
Oh! I just saw that you are selling them. Haha! Awesome!
You should sell packs of these. These are great for hiking or camping to know where everyone is. Haha! I would love to have this but too much work! Haha!
Myself and family bought some at the Brisbane South Bank Markets some years ago and we all walked around the markets chirping like a flock of noisy birds. It was a hoot.
i speak bird and this is some of the most depraved gutter talk I've ever had the misfortune to stumble upon.....  u sir are a cad.
U can also do this with just like rubber glove material instead of pig intestine xxx
im looking for a word "Swallowed" in the comments section
I was expcting "how to basic"-plot-twist any time..
I'm a Dutch angle dragon so I made one of these bc my angle dragon chirps like telphone
I don't have salami like that xD
I thought he meant "saliva" but he actually used salami
Crazy whistle!
Angel Dragon !!
perfect i needed this for a sound effect thank u soo much
gREAT iDEA. but do not use OvEN cLEANER IN YOUR MOUTH!!! TOXIC!!!
me gustan tus videos pero no entiendo tu idioma.
Swallows*
Now i can squeek like Telephone too! :D
who else got here because of the bird lady from America got talent video?
You can get them at https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01BO4VTTG/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1478492608&sr=8-4&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=bird+whistle&dpPl=1&dpID=41tt-ghO9hL&ref=plSrch
No need for all that. You can make a whistle from almost any leaves of plants or grass. All you do in cut a leaf or a grass blade making sure you get the lustrous or waxy part of the leave by itself attached to a part of the leaf/grass blade,  then just place it behind your front teeth - press with the tip of your tongue up the palate and blow air. And presto!
lol
anyonr else get goosebumps?
this is fake i tried it and it didn't work
the fuck is salami

Can you make a vegan version ?

Damn.... swallowed it
clean it with oven cleaner!? sure that's not toxic in the least.
Am I the only one who actually thinks this is cool? Or it´s just full of dickheads continually complaining about rusted washers? You should stop living immediately, because every time you breathe in a city (or elsewhere) all the chemicals that are in the air go straight into your lungs, boo-hoo...
great away to annoy someone
salami skin in large intestin of either pig or goat, lamb, ect.
what if someday u swallowed that XD
how to make a bird whistle with sheep intestine
and thats how you get worms in your stomache
wtf how did I get here?!
the question isn't how did i get here, but, when I did, Why did I stay and watch the whole thing?
0:11 salami jajaj quien te da salami? mmmmmmm amador
these instructions are very unclear the whole salam is stuck in my birds throat
so awesome
There YouTube I watched it now stop recommending it to me T_T
Nice to see your Nasty tongue on the thumbnail weird weirdo
Hi . (sorry for bad english)
he's accent reminds me of hellomaphie
What if you swallow it and every time you spoke I made a bird noise *Id like a tee coffteetee
That accent tho
Can I use tape
instructions unclear: got dick stuck to a ceiling fan
this seems like the most pointless in depth tutorial I've come across on youtube
nice sh!t bruh
"Using salami" More like "Using a salami condom"
nice
This was the dankest tutorial ever.
this is the type of video you watch while high or drunk
I've. Got a bird whistle at a fair
Instructions unclear, swallowed a whole bird
Will use non toxic glue, but yet puts rusty metal in his mouth. Fantastic logic.
Weird asf.
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW YOUTUBE?
THATS G
They already sell these at every sporting good store. It's just an animal call.
The comment section is just too hilarious.
Did this crazy guy put oven grease remover on his hands!???
Ma sei italiano
... the skin of the salami... Junge dir ist klar, dass das DARM ist ja?
Great now fuck off and get away from my recommended
That's not skin...
change the speed to 0.25 at 4:08
all those close ups are harsh
is it a Old covk?
Wow I went from battlefield 1 videos to this
Can you use anything else than the skin???
head phone warning plz I 😣😣😣 just the start gave me a headache 😖😖
Don't use toxic glue, but it's fine to use oven cleaner. Cool.
Non toxic glue is very important, but use oven cleaner :D
I guess when he says non toxic glue he means regular cyanoacrylate..  a.k.a.  super glue.  thats neat im interested to try this..  it looks like he had to find a specific type of salami skin to do this tho.  also the very thin washers seem tricky to find..  perhaps some stainless steel ones sanded down would work..
How did i get here
I love salami
Unclear Instructions, burnt my dick off with a flame-thrower.
how can i replace the salami skin?
3:32 and onwards looks extremely psychedelic
1:32 I will take some penis
omg he didnt clean the washer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A wonderful video!! I have just suscribed to your channel!!
Would this work with pepperoni?
Why the hell is this recommended to me #261
who the fuck wanna sound like birds xD
so is it tasty?
I thought it was a fucking saw blade in his mouth
the salami skin looks like a used condom
Thats cool. Good idea.
White people things... Whistle like a bird using a Salami... amazing.
help me get 2000subs without video
Why am I here. I went from Jazz to this.
I bet hes had a lot of salami in that mouth.
yes use the oven cleaner. the toxic degreaser that breaks down fat and proteins. not like you got that in your mouth
recommend?? wtf
I should be doing my step transfer function and not watching this.
I'm on THIS side of YouTube again
i would probably accidentally swallow it
why is this in my recomended?
2:41 how the hell did this guy figure this out
Thanks, you gave me an idea for a potential source of a semi-permeable membrane
I was really excited to see him blow into some salami ):
Mr. Ed
This would have been 100% better if he just ate the salami and didn't need it for the whistle.
wtf is salamey.?
Get this crap out of my recommended section. I could care less.
holy shit.. this looks : Translate=Behindert
the cringe is so fucking real
i am really irritated... why are you using the hole salami skin? And why do you need a paper cup? You can easily use normal paper...
LOL, way too much work and effort for a lame bird whistle mate. Easier to buy one.
I swallow these back in the day and today I still wonder if I ever did shit it out or not.
okay youtube, u happy? i have watched it!
is this a meme??????
what if you fucking chocke on this shit!
you used oven cleaning & then put it in your mouth??? lol
Who else said "turbo!" when he whipped out the hair dryer?
very old, they are selling at the Oktoberfest in munich for such a long time and they are not very expensive
get out of my recommended
Ive never seen acid like that before
wtf is this weird ,hahaha
Some transvestites in Istanbul are known to carry razor blades in their mouths for self-protection. I don't know why I said that.
Man oven cleaner uses sodium hydroxide, caustic soda which is so damn toxic. You're talking about non-toxic glue but you're using a fucking caustic chemical product... "Ingestion of sodium hydroxide can cause severe corrosive injury to the lips, tongue, oral mucosa, esophagus, and stomach." https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=246&tid=45
Be sure to limber-up your tongue with a nice shot of oven cleaner prior to calling.
Can i use black salami instead?
Pro Tip: Wash your fingers befor you craft the whistle!!!
is it bad that I swallowed it...
just put this oven cleaner, glue, and rust in your mouth and you can get picked up by the cops at the city park and sent to the insane asylum
AW
Why you guys think this is useless?  Honestly, as a girl, I think it is pretty cool, and it would definitely make a girl laugh.  : )
whistles are cool x3
Et dire que j'ai paye ce truc 6 € a walibi bahahahahahahahha
They're is so old.. they've been around for years. But making them yourself? Now that's fuckin' cool.   I've been looking to buy these for ages. Now I can just make them at home. Cheers Rulof.
can i use my OWN SALAMI????
also, not sure what id do if i saw someone whistling like this at the park..... most likely snapchat it.
he didnt even use the salami
Hey Sam, nice trick. Did Frodo teach you?
Italy's space program is currently making progress use Salami to fly to the moon
instructions unclear, got tongue stuck in Dvd player.
Non toxic glue, yet he uses oven cleaner on the skin.
Be sure to use non toxic glue on the stuff you cleaned with oven cleaner?

0:43 you use a cutter??? i usually use a chainsaw :P
Salami is not Helal
He made sure to tell us about non toxic glue but he coated that thing in Oven cleaner....not exactly safe
I thought in the thumbnail was someone taking a wicked nasty tab
What about if you're vegetarian?
Next time I'm stranded in the forest with nothing but a salami, I'll keep this in mind
ntm
I was suposed to be asleep 2 hours ago... what am i doing
Finally humanity can communicate with the creatures of the sky! We best not let this incredible power fall into the wrong hands or they might tell the birds to help them in the fight to take over our lands! It must be protected!
He needs to be tarred and feathered. The scary thing about it is I thought I saw him in my yard hanging from a branch in the  tree and he had two of those dam things in his mouth. I'm off to the store. got to go to buy some salami!!!!
oven cleaner in my mouth? no thanks
you're a real weirdo, Rulof.  A real... real, weirdo.

This video just wasn't disappearing from my recommend list

RUDY RUDY RUDY

now i know how to act like an idiot in public, ty!
looks like a sawblade, could i use a sawblade instead? lol
WHY IS THIS IN MY RECOMMENDED
uuuuummmmm....... Oven cleaner? People have picked up on the rusty washer and talking about the delicious salami..... but what about the oven cleaner?!?!?!? Sure! I'll clean the salami skin with with nasty oven cleaner chemicals before putting it in my mouth.....
Why would I need to stand around making weird bird noises... in fact, why am I sitting here watching you give us close ups of your wet tongue???
So your blowing into pig intestent
what is salami?

Incredible  tetanus Whistle
very good object for pranking ppl xDD (y) like!

'It is all crispy and hard', sounds like he's describing his teenage brother's sock.

isn't salami skin like guts?
Bird: "WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT MY MOTHER?!?!!" <.< lol

TE MAGYAR VAGY
dried colon, oven cleaner and glue are things I would prefer to stay out of my mouth...
shit i used toxic glue
this is equivalent to "How to make glowsticks at home"
i like the retro hair dryer
We can see, You really got a sharp knife.
why use salami skin? why not just plastic
He didn't show eating the salami, I need a step by step for that.
What could you use other than salami?
And Where are the Birds? I thought they would rush towards him when they would hear that noise. Oh well, at least the sound is quite convincing.
Awesome
looks like dirty. putting that on my mouth is a big NO NO
Is this guy tryna fucking kill people. they had these at the ekka when i was a kid and they didnt nearly kill you
lol I can do this without a whistle
Or you could go and buy one, so you dont spend 40 dollars on salami
this bird thingy is old, I bought it for 50 cents at a store 10 years ago lol
He looks like Sam from the Lord of the Rings
Purpose?
I wouldn't advise putting that washer in your mouth
Lol of course fuckin mario here says i need to use a salami skin
I prefer to make mine out of a used rubber, bloody tampon (cleaned of course with oven cleaner), and a rusty nail.
I think that washer cut his tongue just by looking at the thumbnail.
what if im vegan?
If I put that on the end of my penis, I save the money on buying the Salami. But can I make incredible bird sounds with my penis to attract a mate. If you make bird sounds from your penis, women are supossed to flock to you.
Is that a salami? O_o
Sounds like a Togepi
"today I'm going to show you how to make a bird whistle using ONLY some salami, a paper cup and some glue."  Things you will also need -scissors -a coin -pliers -oven cleaner -some wood -4 pins -a hairdryer -a washer
yeah, a whistle using only salami... and paper cups. and glue. oh did I forgot to mention that you need oven cleaner, 4 nails and a piece of wood? oh and don't forget those metal pieces everyone has at home, those are important.
When are you going to continue Malkovich's Guilty Gaming Pleasures?
that must taste like shit
I love these things and this is the first time i've seen anyone make one. Thanks :)
Love how the title is "how to make a bird whistle with salami" doesn't even use the salami just the skin

Annoying.

Mama Mia!! This guy is so Italiano that not even Mario can handle such Italiano cuisine!!
After seeing all that work, it is impressive but then seeing how dirty it is and then sticking it in your mouth, no thank you. I will download bird sounds app and play that because I'm not sticking dirty stuff in my mouth to make a bird noise when I can use an app but it is cool
Wtf is with this guy and salami like Salami is life?!?!
They sell like this in TURKEY !
Samwise Gamgee, IS THAT YOU???

Herpes?
That one weird kid in the center of the classroom
How the hell did you get you're teeth so yellow 😖
I can whistle like that without this :)
during highschool science, we had to dissect a bird, the teacher taught us something cool, how to hook up a wire with a 2v current to the brains input for sound.... even though it was dead, the muscle was still attached and the bird was chirpping.. is this creepy? maybe.. but funny as  hell. Try it.
Directions weren't very good I got my cat stuck in the toaster..
He sounds like an angry squirrel.
You are the man, thanks for the diy project. I love these things
why is the lake at the end of the video poo brown
thanks now i can whistle in jail
Worries about non-toxic glue... cleans salami with oven cleaner...
I don't suggest doing this in america.. lol
salami skin...wait what?..left with naked salami you can eat real fast...ha
Thanks, that's amazing! Now look out for bird hunters!
everybody knows the bird is the word
Cool video, but man wash your hands an all those things , expecially since they all ended in your mouth lol !
Ok, I just swallowed mine, will I be able to shit this out?
How tf did I end up on this video
how the fuck I get here?
How the fuck did someone figure this out in the first place...
ur freakin me out dude
oven cleaner? ya that sounds safe, but hey he did use non toxic glue to stick it to the cardboard :)
oh lets shove a salami skin thats caked in oven cleaner in our mouth! (sarcasm) never ever tell people to use that on anything that will go into your mouth
you probably shouldn't use oven cleaner if it's going in your mouth
The next EDM
i like salami ,but bird sound good
What kind of fucking salami is that and the hair dryer ?   where tf do you live
damn
Ooooh yeah. Unwrap that salami REALLY slowly...
I found this fucking hilarious. Probably because of the potential real life trolling.
I seriously thought he said lube
i remember they gave us those in amusement parks we had like tons of them lol
Oven cleaner in the mouth... Great idea.
WTF IS THIS VIDEO
oven cleaner/glue/mouth?
Important: eat the salami
so what happened to the salami?????
Thank you for the study break, I'm gonna get back to my essay now
This guy is so Italian he can build everything out of Salami!
My cockatiel is very confused right now.
Badass black&white outro was expecting a gangsta music playing, disappointed, still badass big guy sounding like a little birdy
where is frodo?
who thought of this in first place ?  great vid btw
Crazy :-)
still takes a lot of technique to do it
whistle while you twerk!
when the world blows up and we forget what birds sound like JUST  USE THIS!
what do you think the birds are hearing
could have sword that was Ricky from TPB when he first panned in.
I love how he keeps showing it's still in his mouth, as if he's convincing us "See? I haven't eaten it. It's still there!" Cracks me up :P
birds are like "the fuck that idiot sayin"
NEVER spray oven cleaner onto your bare hands. There is a high chance you will badly burn your skin, as there is a dodo chance it contains Caustic Soda.
anyone else get annoyed/
salami? this look more like "Cacciatore"
You got a purty mouth.
I would love if the salami had absolutely nothing to do with the project besides serving as a snack
I legit pissed my self laughing when he first did it
he not uses salami only wrapping. so disappointgin
What if I swallow it? XD
As

the souns of it is cringe
i made one, but i dont now how to use it, i cant fucking figure it out
I love the way you say salami
cringe
non toxic glue, clean your salami skin, washer and pliers.
I only save curse words for special occasions. This guy has too much fucking time on his hands.
Gret tutorial. I learn proper way to eat the oven cleaner, rusty washer, and industrial super glue all at same time. Ty
That salami looks delicious!!!
Now wash the skin that you'll be putting in your mouth with oven cleaner... Sounds like a great idea
that hair dryer is from soviet russia. Good for drying "naked salami".
You could use wax paper
AMAZING
Anyone thought, JUST WASH THE WASHER BEFORE DOING IT!!
0:56 its ya boy skinny pennis
jajajajjaja 👍
Cool
chicken
we only need salami skin, paper cup and non toxic glue.    now take some metal washers
Sarebbe meglio mangiare quel salame
Dafuq was the first few words???
i know. you are the guy on man vs food
im VEGAN what can i do?!?!?!?!
Does the paper cup get damp and stop working? How quickly does that happen? I really need to know.
Great video, wash your hands.
that title is the same as some stupid shit like "Cook a full 5 course meal using salt!"
Poor instructions, bird stuck in penis
How do you use it?
thank you!!! this helped me attract and kill 38 birds!!!
oh god wash your hands... and also learn english
hes got a phat ass
Birdman
salami skin is usually made of intestine:)
You reeeally like salami, don't ya?
wtf
this is easily the coolest/weirdest thing I've seen all week. i have doubts I'd be able to use it correctly though.
Would wax paper work?
Does it work when you have a gap in your teeth?
I had one
New tarzan movie copied this 😂
i use to use my retainers do to this. didnt know it was an actual thing

Cool
Fellow tingleheads jump to 1:51 #ASMR #MaximumCrinkle

Your just fucking with the birds 😸😸😸
Wow, you made a Canary Caller!
you can also use a surgical glove in stead off salami skinn
perché non fai video in italiano
Hey uhh is it okay if i swallow it heh just asking please tell me...

You're so jobless..
can you use something other than salami skin?
good prank for people too
Instructions unclear: Ate salami
Did he just tell people to spray a wrapper in OVEN CLEANER and glue it with CRAZY GLUE and put it in their mouth? Is this an instructional for cancer?

Pretty good
When I was a kid (60 years ago), we bought these in the drug store for a quarter each. I loved them! I would buy them still if available.  Problem: The salami (and all meat) here in America have thin plastic wrap; skin like this is unavailable. Does anyone know what could be used instead of "animal casings"?
when he whistled i got triggered
this triggered me
that wistle was so cool
salami............
how do you play it uhiguh
Sounds like togepi
i bet you get the attention of all the birds with that mate ;) :)
can't you just use wax paper?  rather than salami skin...
or you could just buy a pack of 10 for 15$ off of amazon
the salami cost more than buying one online lol
this is f up
is there a substitute for the salami skin?
can we use wax paper
the hair draier looks like a turbo
Has any one done Lord of the rings joke yet?
My love bird is going crazy here.  Must mean it's a good bird whistle.
why dont you juste buy a salami wrapper?
isnt that just some wax paper he got off the thing of meat?
instructions unclear, bird glued to tongue, please help
I can tell you put alot of effort into making your videos in english. Where in italy are you from?
someone should make a channel like this that only has salami based projects/.
can you say "No Mr bond... I want your salami"
use non toxic glue but oven cleaner is fine.
Awesome.
bello il phon anni 60
i am a big salami
xD
I used super toxic glue. I think Im dying.
can i use for that a hot glue pistol too?
Very cool.
fuc* very very xpensive and difficult
A street seller used to sell these when i was a child, every summer when i was at the city i was so impatient to hear the guy and would harass my parents to buy me one of these
Usare della plastica al posto del cartoncino per aumentare la durata del fischietto potrebbe funzionare?
Take something you soaked in oven cleaner and stick it in your mouth.
I  I'm vegetarian which thing I use as salami
can I use thin plastic instead of paper?
ahahahah
Wtf?is a salami
Is there a go d alternative to the salami skin?
Wow I've never seen a cutter I want one
i bet the ladies love him lol
WHY THE SALAMI SKIN ??????!!!!!!!!!
Did he just clean that with oven cleaner and then stick it in his mouth?
please make electric longboard
my cat reacts to the sound, so it must be a very good imitation :D
I don't think it matters if the glue is non-toxic if you wash the skin in oven cleaner and then put it in your mouth?? Never ever put oven cleaner in your mouth.
Anything else I can use instead of salami skin? Just plastic?
its really cool  ............
How long do these whistles last for ?
anyone else notice he put oven cleaner in his mouth pretty sure that  shit toxic af
how to choke 101
1:32  "i will take some penis" This killed me :DD
where can i find these cups?
Something about the words "Salami skin" sounds perverted
Telephone anyone?
we paid 5 cents for those whistles
I had those when I was 5 and in the Island we used to make them out a plant found all over the world :) you can also get a metal bottle cap, remove the cork in it and hammer it to a flat then fold it in 2 and bang a hole with nail at 3/16 from the fold. Open the cap a bit ,set in mouth and is the loudest whistle you can hear. Those were the days when you made your own toys :) No  toys R us
Make one to call girls over.
krayzi
:)
Ok I ordered 2 from eBay, how do I use them? What do I do to make the sound?

That moment you've been here since 30K when he made the underwater tank Kappa
Aw man, over here in the USA all of our meat has skin made of plastic :(
The stuff surrounding salami is actually the lining of pork intestine

Mmm... Oven cleaner!
Good job. I made it... all birds attack for kill me.
Good job. I made it... all birds attac for kill me. ;)

New favorite Youtuber. Thanks for the design!
Terrible eBay feedback Rulof ha ha perhaps you should start a new account with eBay just for selling, plus if your buying stuff on that account for your projects anyone can see that with your feedback as a buyer
