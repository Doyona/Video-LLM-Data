IS is weird that me, an elementary student in 5th grade is reading a book that a high-schooler is reading?
i also wear retainers  for my bottom and top teeth
oh my gosh I just love routines you have to make more  y'all inspire me soooooo much
I know this is kind of random but it isn't always good to have 10 hours of sleep for anyone who gets that much but it's ok just no more than 11! (9 1/4 is a good amount)
Brooklyn and bailey omg they film like....AMAZING.can you do a vlog about how you get ready for Christmas-on that day
THERE'S NO HOMEWORK???

WHERE DID YOU GET YOU GLASSES?! OMG
omg i l💘ve that book series
I still cant tell between Brooklyn and Bailey
Great video!
3:52 OH <3 That book <3 <3 <3 <3
That sounds like a good night! I have online college now that I graduated high school and most of the time I watch youtube or read a book. I love the selection series!! I read it all and am currently reading the last book with the daughter Eadlyn. It's really good! I use coconut oil to take off my makeup and then use Aveda cleanser; and depending on weather its summer or winter I use the one according to what my skin is feeling like. :)
4:20, me watching Les Miserables.
I like too catch up on youtube write  my fanfiction and writing in my song book.
👍
omg!! she lools so weird at the end of the video
I love that book: the elite
Which breed is Braidy? He looks exactly like mine! but I don't really know its breed :)
☑👍
She was reading my favorite book series ever!!!
Do a fall morning routine plzzz😉😉😉
I'm literally like a half of Brooklyn and bailey
Where did you get ur glasses? I love them!
brady is so cute!
Your dog is so cute!💕😍💎
I have never had a cavity before
How come brooklyn wont do videos like u bailey???????
Bailey looks so pretty with her glasses
wait wheres brooklyn?
This is such an expectation 😂😂😂love you!💖
YOUR DOG IS SO CUTE🙃
You guys could make a video comparing between your night/morning/school routines. That would be kinda different
lol i just read the elite the book shes reading😂😂
HOT CHOCOLATE YUM 🍫☕️
1:30 all I think of when I hear PB is peanut butter! lol
I thought this was Brooklyn.
She gets 10 hours of sleep? I get like, 2.
Bailey is so beautiful
Because I am.
Are you guys Mormon???
More of these 😊

wich twin is older
Your dog 🐶 is so adorable! Ilysm ❤️️
heyyyyy!!! i would really love it if i won the mac book it would mean the world to meee  ❤❤❤
so adorable I want him
did you name him braidy because you are a braiding family
Love it so so much. Best I've seen in a while
j
I've read the book series that she's reading in the video 4 times I'm obsessed
So I just cry but after watching the part you watch the movie I am happier love you
I watch movies without popcorn 🍿 because of my braces😓
Hot chocolate 🍫
''Who can watcht a movie without popcorn'' Gurl it's called having health issues. I can risk my life if I eat  popcorn.
Bailey i love your glasses😍😍
😍😍
Omg! I just finished the selection  series and it is so good!
He is cute
Her face when she was watching a horror movie and eating popcorn
He's so cute (the dog)
ugh you are so annoying in this video
I don't feel like this is completely realistic. She has a large family and you would think they would include them. Also it seemed like she was just acting for the camera and trying to be silly and goofy.  I would be interested in a real night time video of what actually goes on.
that dog is soooooo cute
(-please go give our channel a subscribe
Brooklyn and I*😂
i want that babyyyy that dog is so cuteee
do you play pokemon go
Who's elder Brooklyn or baily 🙈🙈

i have like 30 sticky note reminders in my room
Can you do Brooklyn's fall/winter night routine?!? I loved Bailey's😍😍
hahahhahah. this was really a cool and real one, by real i mean u people did not try to show a perfect routine like any youtubers would but u actually be yourself. and according to me, being a subscriber, being a braileyer, this is actually what most of the Braileyers would actually want to have. Thanks for making our day. Luv u XOXO

Please unblock me on Instagram i didn't do anything..I don't understand I'm heartbroken 😔💔
i don't like how she said the makeup remover is her favorite when it looks like she just opened it. i've been subscribed for a long time and it seems like they're sponsoring things more than ever. i'm happy their channel is successful, but should i even trust that their opinions are unbiased anymore?
Bailey does this take off all waterproof mascara also.. ?
I have that same bluer shirt Gaga twins I love it. The one that u wore in the intro
Why does americans brushes their teeth before eathing?! I don't get it
dog is cute and what i do i watch tv and play on my iphone7 and stay in pj and slippers forever and ever i cuddle with my dog bella so cute!!!!!!!!!!!
am i the only one who's night and morning routine is the same exact routine every season
She literally makes my cat life
How can she be slim with all that gross stuff that she eats
What app do you use to make your videos look so good??

Bailey looks pretty without makeup
Those slippers are so cute & I'm obsessed with popcorn 😂

Hey guys I was just wondering when are you guys doing a fall fashion look and if you guys would do it then I would be so happy 😁
O.M.G! Their dog is so adorable! And that hot cocoa made me crave some SO BAD. Loved the video! ♥
I just realized why they called their dog Braidy... braids! lol

I know you probably will, but please do 'Bailey fall morning routine',  'Brooklyn fall night routine', and 'Brooklyn fall morning routine'
Were was Brooklyn
sooooo let me get this straight? she doesn't eat dinner?
love you
Wasn't it cute when Brady turned and looked at the camera ??😝❤️ Also Brooklyn and Bailey you were the ones that inspired me to wear contacts but before that I wasn't confident. Thank you 😊.
Omg Brady is soooooo cute guys
Is it just me or is Bailey always overshadowing Brooklyn? Like, Bailey already did the summer morning routine and she said that Brooklyn was going to do the night routine and now she's doing it. I'm not saying that she's a bad person or a bad sister but maybe she could let Brooklyn be in the spotlight once in a while.
Aww such a awesome Idea. I need to do one of these
I'm blind as a bat without my glasses
What type of dog is Brady? He's too cute😢💖
I LOVE TJAT SERIES OMG ITS THE BEST

Hair tutorial please
THIS GIRL IS SOOOOO ANNOYING
