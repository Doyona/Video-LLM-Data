Is there a way to do this without a loom
It all snapped when I took it off😭
Como coloco el moño?? :(
I love this I found out that if you made it smaller then you would have a baby one, could I do a video of the baby one?of course I would give you credit for the best way of making it.
thanks
i did it and it was amazing! thank you so much :)
it looks like the deadpool symbol
*IS DONE LOOPING! VICTORY LEAP!* takes off charm at last peg there is too many rubber bands *CHARMS BREAKS*
I can never get this right when I end it it always go wrong D:
@Duchess Jamie You can cap a black band 4 times on you're hook and put 1 band (same color as you're base color) and slip the capped band onto it and do what she did with the band with pony beads on it.   :)

Love this so much its so cute and fun marzlooms tutorials are the only tutorials I use please make more new tutorial videos😀
My 1st one broke
i realized that to make the knot in the bow, u quadrouple loop the knot color
can u use a double looped rubberband for the eyes instead of beads?
dont have peads u shoude fing a never way for eyes like i did
becus i made it on a crazy loom and it works
can we use the crazy loom
wow this is so nice and easy i made 2 in 30 minutes(the first one took close attention xD)
Nice fuzzies charm

mY FUZZIE WAS SOOO CUTE
Awsome
oh thanks
this is an amazing and cute idea
TY TWO OF MY BANDS BROKE BUT WAS EASY TO FIX I USED TO BLACK BANDS TWISTED IT 2 TIMES MINE TURNED OUTN AMAZING
My first one fell apart and the second broke my loom😢
A great little cute make. Good for a quick little bit of fun to get rid of some bands. They do become a bit addictive, he he. I found that if you use a different colour band for the last capper knot, then cut it in half, it should look like a tuft of hair. I also used two black bands twisted 4 times for the eyes. My fuzzy is amazing! Thank you! :D { Sub earned }
I don't wanna be rude or anything but you could have mentioned having the headband part at the beginning so we could have changed it before even putting the bands the body was gonna be
i think that we can find a way to create a ring
i done really well im really surprised that i could do it i
I made two
It's amazing I've made thousends of them.
I love the fuzzy
You just earned a sub
Italy!!!!!
Can you make is rainbow colored
It don't look good ones it's done
Mollie Fox
Cool mine is so cute
Cool mine is so cute
mine fell apart
My fuzzie looks crap
It's so cute and easy 😜
I failed like 5 times before I got it right
Or three times
If you dont have beads then wrap two black rubber bands around your hook twice.
👍
what is the difference between pony beads and beads
if you want to do eyes you have to wrap a singal band around your hook 3 times and do a second eye then take a band and pull the eyes on it I did it it looked so cute and awesome
my did not look right it looked ugly
Ik had geen parels maar ik heb het opgelost door een zwart rekkertje
Irish dancer
I done the eyes with rubber bands
nul et tro dure

You should do a video on how to do a fuzzy with a bow or a headband
You just loop the bands 3 times then get a band and pull it on
OMG! They are soo cute love them
For anyone who dosent have beads just use a cap band twisted 4 times!! My fuzzie looked so cute!!
Don't have beads
If you don't have beads then use a black band, Hook it 4 times around your hook and get whatever colour your using and place the black band over the colour your using! SIMPLE
So going to make this!
Cute x
They are so cute! (I did the eyes with black rubber bands)
Can't do it!! 😪😪😪😢😢
