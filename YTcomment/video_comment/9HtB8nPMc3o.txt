It’s actually a very well written and comprehensive book https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxhgbP-6hUnXu_QRaoHgLztgsI0YF3HqR0 . I wanted to pair this with an updated book on local codes to start planning a post-retirement dream shop. I think I have just about everything I need between the two. The extra plans available for purchase towards the end are priced almost as much as full home plans, not little sheds however.

I appreciate it
does this material meet building regs? What's the U value?
Really good video. Thanks. Love from Scotland, x.
Does it comply with building regs in England?
Do you guys service the US?
great video - could you turn the garage into a bedroom or would THAT actually require planning? thank you
Hey Wassup Guys!
The lighting is great, presents a very warm cozy feel
Very nice! I am envious! I will do the same to my garage!
how much did this cost and how long did it take?
