Could we use honey  or charop honey instead of molasses?  If yes whats the amount to be used. Thank you
Recipe looks great! How much lemon juice do I use for the lemon icing?
Thank you I did make it just waiting to cook, making my Christmas
What can I substitute the molasses?
Ya mon!
I have made this cake and I added the grated fresh ginger on top of the powdered. It is really, really delicious.
Put vanilla cream cheese frosting and sprinkles on it. Add raisins to gingerbread cake.
Thank you Stephanie. I really appreciate your very nice approach. Will definitely try this very soon. ❤
I like to watch your tutorial baking. You explained very well with tsp,tablespoons,cups and grams. Well done.
Going to make a ginger cake, great to see how nice yours turned out. Thanks for your baking tips too!
Stephanie, thank you so much for sharing it! It’s gonna be my first time making a gingerbread cake. Do you think that it has structure for a tall cake with 3 layers of filling?
I tried the recipe it's nice but too sugary...maybe use half of the measurements
Me he vuelto adicta a tus videos, me encantan estos bizcocho enlatado, aún no he hecho pero pronto ya me pondré. Gracias por enseñarnos tus conocimiento!!
I baked this cake yesterday and was delighted with the results--a moist, fluffy cake full of lovely flavours. Very cheering on a rainy autumn afternoon with a cup of Earl Grey. Thank you for such a delicious recipe. I really like the way you explain adding each ingredient, especially helpful for those of us who are new to baking.
Can I use a loaf pan for this recipe?
Yummy
When making gingerbread I use fresh ginger or is ground ginger better for making gingerbread? What's the difference between gingerbread and gingerbread cake
No need of dry yeast
My cake got huge crack in the middle 😣
Air fryer not possible for food
Served with whipped cream and thinly sliced bananas. Mmmmm…
can one substitute 1/2 cup sour cream or heavy cream whipped for the milk?  can one double the recipe and use a tube pan?  can one double the recipe and use a 1/2 sheet?
OMG! I just baked this cake and it came out so good 😋. Thanks you so much, I feel so proud:)
wow it was to much molasses
Is it okay if i skip mollases... because its difficult to find in my hometown...
Hi.... can i use loaf pan to bake this kind of cake
True ❣️😊 wonder full 🌝 cake beautiful 🥰 n plate in which you serve beautiful 😍 super delicious 😋😋🤤🤤
I think this would be good with a cream cheese frosting... Thank you for sharing!
You are the best
Hi thank you for sharing this recipe I baked this cake it comes out very soft but it doesn't have ginger teast I used 1 tbs ginger powder
Pls you  are really  a good teacher  but am confused about the measurement  the way cups give different grams  for instance  same I 0ne cup  of margarine l will give different  measurements  in grams and same one cup in  with molasses will give different  measurements  in grams why that difference again I want to know if u can used mar garin instead of butter
In the UK we have what is called black treacle, is this the same as molasses? Beautiful cake 👍x
Can I use honey as a substitute for molasses?
I used honey instead of molasses and it tastes heavenly in winter time with some warm custard sauce.
Amendment. Sorry I meant to say that I would be using black treacle instead of molasses
Thank you stephenie. Amazing cake. I have just made an english jamaican ginger cake. I will be making this in 2 weeks for a resident in a care home. Except one thing I wont be using black treacle instead of molasses as it is very expensive in my country malaysia. Ofcourse  ginger is abundent hete. Tq for recipe.
Can't wait to make it. 😊
Oh wow!  This looks 😋 delicious and easier to make than some of the recipes I’ve seen on UTube.  Always such clear and helpful instructions too!  😊 thanks
Stephanie,   HELP‼️     Once again, I made your wonderful recipe for the Gingerbread Cake.    I have made it several times, ALWAYS having the same problem.     First, you ask, if there is a problem, why do you continue to bake it. . . . .answer being, it is the most DELICIOUS Gingerbread Cake EVER!!  My problem is, at the last 5 minutes of baking, the center begins to fall.   It has done this EVERY time!       PLEASE, do you have a suggestion for me?     It did this with my old oven, and now it is also doing this with my new oven.  So I don't think it is the oven.   Yes, we are a mile high, one hour south of Denver.    I am a very experienced baker. . . .and have not had to make adjustments to recipes.   ( Maybe this one is different.)  Any suggestions you could give me would be good!     I follow the recipe exactly except for the optional grated ginger.     You can see my photo of pink glass dish.  . . . .makes a beautiful presentation!    (I add a whipped cream and cream cheese frosting, stabilized with a little Cornstarch.   It is AMAZING ON YOUR CAKE!      Thanks for your recipes. . . . .feel like I know you!  Blessings,
Thank you for the reacpe
What's the substitute for eggs ????
Fresh cows cream would be delicious with this cake😋.
I was a baker in my professonal life , so i can verify for the quality of this cake . ( Mmmmm SO good ) A lot of people on the net   Do not tell the truth about the ingredients they put into thier cake , becauae they want  thier product to be better than anybody else .  This is not the case with this woman .  This cake is about as good as it gets .....a 10 out of 10 .  Thank You for this reciepe my Dear .  Your husband is a lucky man .     ( :    Mike
Would this also be called a Ginger Cake or do you have a different recipe?
Ginger and Hot custard!! Perfect pudding.
Where Is the recipe 👀
Mmmmmmm looks yummy 🤤
I am so glad I went with your recipe! It was my first gingerbread cake and it tasted and looked great. It’s not too spicy just how I would like. Thank you! The only thing I changed - I lowered the sugar to 80 g instead of 110 g (but I always do that with any recipe).
This looks amazing; I’m going to give it a try real soon. What a great tip about spraying the measuring cup when measuring sticky liquids! It’s very nice of you to provide metric measurements for those watching outside the USA. It’s so frustrating to watch videos from Europe and elsewhere where those cooks give only metrics and no Imperial.
Please  raspies
I love you cooking your pretzels are the best you’re my favorite I enjoy all your recipes
Ahhh
Mhhhh wait that me
I made this and it tasted a-m-a-z-i-n-g. I made it in this little gingerbread house-shaped pan and it was the cutest thing ever. Can't tell you how much I love this recipe. Defintally will be making this again!
It looks so amazing & delicious. 😋.  Thanks so much.  Cheers 😘❤️🥰😊💕😍
Nice recipe,
Tasted nice. I halved the brown sugar, used dates instead of molasses and one of the sugar alcohol sweeteners instead of white sugar.
Ugh I just love her.💕
Can you use a 9 by 13 cake pan?
the bake time for me is a 1 hr at 180 ?
Kindly mention to me about the blender mixer you use, the make and the cost of it,  thank you.
From Vancouver,  thank you Stephanie for your great recipe gingerbread cake, it is my second time making it. Delicious, moist and flavored 👍👍👍💯💯💯 but I don't know why I have cracks at the top?? I couldn't bake at 350°F, my oven is too hot, so I baked it at 325°F for 45 minutes. Is this the reason why I have cracked top?
Can I use honey instead of molasses?
Beautiful
Gonna bake this cake for my bff :D
Thanks (^_^)/
making this right now for my parents - it was an amazing guide, and thank you for letting me cook with you merry Christmas!
I'm here for any excuse to eat more ginger! Thank you for the delicious recipe!
Made this it was AMAZING! Did a trial run but will be making this for Christmas! First time bringing over a dessert to my boyfriends parents house. This is sure to impress!
Made this today and it came out wonderful, cutting the recipe by half and luckily it works! We already finished a third  of a 9x13 loaf pan. Thanks for great recipe :)
Thank you very nice recipe
Do you have a version of gingerbread cake with cheese cream frosting? I just LOVE LOVE your recipes, absolute best!
Just made this cake and it is so so so good!  So moist, fluffy and flavorful! Thank you!
I don't get molasses where I live. Is it the same as jaggery made into a syrup form?
Steff, my only son who lives in Germany now with his wife and 3 kids under the age of 5, loves gingerbread, so i will make this bread in his honor, because of covid, i can't travel there and meet my newest g'daughter who's already almost 17 mo. old!!   interestingly, because i've taught skin care for over 35yrs, i know by the color of your hair, skin tone, that yuo're warm, and that's why u look so great in orange, yellow, beige, tan, etc. and while u even love those colors in your batters, like the gingerbread today!!  couldn't help but mention that!!  pink btw, isn't your color, its mine,,lol!
Made this cake, and it was the best cake I've ever made! Loved every bite
Can this be made into cupcakes?
I’m going to use this recipe for Christmas. However I live on France and we don’t have molasses here. Could I use honey instead?
I love spice cake that Ginger bread cake looks yummy 😋 good thanks for letting me view it on your channel 💖.
This cake save my marriage,I just made it.

Can I use honey instead of molasses  ?
I want wheat cake simple recipes
Good Cooking I Bit I Like The Side
Wat if I don't have brown suger
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌❤❤❤❤❤
I love this channel, I have one suggestion maybe making the video a bit shorter many people may not have that much time. But great recipes, keep it up!😘
It looks so nice Joy, but I always leave gingerbread cake in the tin until it goes sticky and I also don't know why but I always think of this as a mans cake.I'll give hubby a treat and make one instead of making cream cakes for myself.
Hi Stefanie, I dont know why my ginger bread cake has to bake 45 mins or longer. All the other baking recipes bake according to time frame in recipe
Great video! So easy to follow. Thank you for also mentioning the measurements in centimeters. My cake is baking right now!
Can I substitute molasses with honey?
I am in for weeks not, and made this at xmas, but decided to bake one for myself!! Thanks so much for helping me through this time! Hope you are staying safe.
I am from jamaica an this is  my 2 time  making  this  cake  an it turn out sooo good  very  moist and  my husband love it  thanks  very much  s Campbell
4/3/20 Well watched again, missed the Temp again....where can I find your recipes, you talk too fast I can't write that fast.lol.... and my next question is can you use Self-Rising flour and omit the baking soda & baking powder  ? Well hope I can find your recipes.....
You are the GREATEST,  baker on Youtube with very  clear explanation and easy to follow. ❤️Thank you for sharing
I only have loaf pans.....?
Serve it with ice cream!😊
Made this yesterday- excellent result. Thank you for your clear, easy to follow recipes - and the tips during cooking.
Easy and DELICIOUS!
Looks great! 🧡🧡
If you dont have a mixer can you use a bread making machine? Just curious because a lot of them can make cakes
Stephanie, have you eve heard of Haddon Hall Gingerbread?  I happened to find the recipe in my 1970's copy of the Betty Crocker cookbook.
Hi Stephanie, I made the cake. It was delicious. But it did dome in the middle and then the dome fell when I took it out of the oven. I had to level it and scoop out the middle which was under baked. The family really enjoyed the rest of the cake. Any tips on how to keep it from doming and falling? Also, what type of stand mixer are you using in the video. Thanks!
today saw me make the gingerbread cake two actually using your recipe making these two bring me to having made 10 using the easy recipe thanks for posting the video and the description on your site
So glad to find your Gingerbread Cake.....looks good.....hope to make it soon....I have been looking for one for days.....thanks for posting...
Just love Stephanie. She’s the type of person you’d like to be baking beside you in your home. She has such a calm, easy going way about her. She explains her process so well and adds very helpful tips. A joy to watch. 🙂
You are absolutely one of the best! Thank you.
Wow mouthwatering cake, I can feel the taste😋
For that ginger bread cake I sprinkled a raw sugar/cinnamon mixture instead of four  ... nice
Love this, thank you so much, but did i miss the temperature?
Delicious recipe! But you should get a better attachment for that stand mixer.
I love your video!  Can’t wait to try this:)
Hi for eggless gingerbread cake what do I substitute the egg with
yummy! Awesome! This is pulchritudinous,resplendent,bonny and awe-inspiring
this is awesome! Love getting inspiration from these videos for my baking! :)
Lovely delicious can I substitute honey for sugar.
Thank you for this me and my family are enjoying it right now
What like about you,  You make sure to mention cups and equivalent in grams of the ingredients.  And your recipes are lovely.  Thank you.
is baking soda bicarbonate of soda?
I have molasses but it's in a packet can I use this? it looks like tightly wrapped dark sugar
Just finished baking it😁🤘🏼 Very good and delicious. Replaced butter with canola oil with no problem, was hesitated but it's delicious. Luv luv luv❤😘⚘
I think I used to make a lot of this cake. Sour cream base, melted butter.  Ginger spices.Cardamon. Seems alike.
Stef, I made this recipe, but I made a mistake in misreading the amount of milk to add.  I put twice as much as the recipe calls for in the batter. I had to bake it for 45 minutes to get it done, but the taste of this cake was outstanding. My wife told me to make it again and put the 2 cups of milk in. My daughter, who is a gourmet cook, told me that this cake was better than hers. Happy accident? Next time, I’m going to do it correctly and compare the taste. Thank you for your recipes. I have made several.
Just made this! My cake has just gone into the oven and I’m so excited! I added more ground ginger cinnamon and cloves though, I like a nice punch in my ginger cake! I also added stem ginger and some of the syrup in there. I’ll update you on how it turns out!
You are the best baker and tutor among all the youtubers. Thanks for each and every amazing  recipes . Lots of love 💖
One thing I really love about your show..... You actually scrape the bowls, cups etc. Most cooking shows just pour and half the ingredient is left in the container. I know this is a simple thing.
can I use treacle with the same quantity in this recipe?
It’s not Christmas yet Stephanie but it will be my birthday tomorrow. And seeing as I simply adore anything that starts and ends with ginger, THIS is going to be the cake for me this year. I’m going to make it in a few hours and let it sit all day and all night -(just to get all those flavours really accentuated) -in time for my birthday tomorrow. In fact, the idea is to bake a rectangular loaf with a cream cheese frosting over and between the cake and also make 6 individual gingerbread cupcakes to go with. I already made the cream cheese frosting last night and I’ve stored it in the fridge to really bring out all those flavours incorporated into it. My intentions are to decorate each individual gingerbread cupcake with a tiny gingerbread man. Stephanie, a lovely recipe! Thank you.
I promise i will make this cake. I try so many ur recipe never failed 😎gbu step
Hi Stephanie, I make it today! I make it like a loaf bread and bake 17 loaves. I put homemade candied ginger in the bread. It tastes really nice. Thanks!!
Very nice thank you
7:46
Where can I purchase the blender?
my fav4
In what oven temperature should I bake this cake?
Tried many of your cakes. Dates, banana bread,  apple cake, etc. You have very useful tips or secrets. Thank you for that lemon zest tips. Have to try this. 👏
Hi I just tried Ur cake. It's still in the oven but I felt the batter split the moment I added milk to the batter containing the black treacle. Is it common or what have I done wrong. Not sure how will it taste in the end.
Hi Ms.Joy I love the flavor of Gingerbread.its and old 🎂 cake.My grandmother made Gingerbread for my Mom and her siblings when they were young that was the 1930s and 1940s for Christmas and Mincemeat pies,and Fruitcakes.I have never made Gingerbread before.I love Ginger snap cookies.ill like to see you do some Ginger Snap cookies for the holidays and Butter cookies,and Sugar Cookies.ILove your 📹.Pam Johnson
The great thing about this cake is that you can add carrots, plums, really anything you like...
bravooooo👏👏👏👏👏
I'm going to try this at the Weekender I love ginger! I feel that a mint custard sauce would be a nice side to this! Is molasses black    treacle in the UK?
would this work with cream cheese frosting ?
any substitute for molasses?
I just made this gingerbread and it came out great! It took closer to 40min to bake completely. I made a few muffins with the batter too. They taste amazing with the whipped cream. I love this recipe! (:
You are amazing and your recipes are absolutely fantastic!!!!!  What differences you from other you tubers is that you 1) explain everything in great details, 2) you actually automatically change the weights into metric !!( nobody does that !!) 3) YOUR RECIPES COME OUT OF MY OVEN  EXACTLY HOW YOU MAKE THEM !!!!! O.M.G !!!!!! ...i THOUGHT YOU  MUST HAVE BEEN HIDING IN MY KITCHEN !!! hA hA hA !!!  Like  Hella Green I TOO have stopped looking at  other  YOU TUBERS , BECAUSE I KNOW , that your recipe WILL WORK  and be SCRUMPTIOUS !!!! Well done Stephanie and thankyou for making my family HAPPY :)
What can we use instead of molasses? Please let me know,thanks
I made this ginger cake following your recipe and added crystalised ginger, amazing. I whipped cream using a small amount of ginger syrup.
I made this the other day and it was delicious. The only thing is that the toothpick in the middle came out clean after 35 minutes (I checked at 30 but it wasn’t clean so baked for another 5 minutes), but when the caked cooled, it sunk in the middle...it actually wasn’t done! My oven is usually perfect for these recipes, so I guess next time, I will bake for 40 minutes. BTW, even the gooey, uncooked middle was delicious. 😃
I have made this for the last three Xmas season's. It's a winner. Simple, soft, and delicious!
What is molasses in the uk?
Great video, I going to try this recipe soon. Thank you for sharing 😍
Stephanie is the cutest, down to earth baker on Youtube imo ;)
This is a wonderful recipe.
baked this cake wonderful it took an hour to bake
Made this today. Added 100g mashed sweet potato and 100g applesauce to replace the butter, used whole wheat flour and freshly grated ginger in addition to the ground ginger from the jar. Pretty yummy!
Lemon sauce is to die for with gingerbread.  My grandmother used to make that and I loved it so much.
what can I use instead of eggs?
Stephanie! Cannot find molasses! What can I use instead?
M gonna try your recipe this time....  Last time I bake a cake for my cousin birthday... I took a recipe from your website.... Chocolate banana cake... It turn out a good compliment from my relative and family... Thanks for your wonderful recipes...
you're doing a great job out there
can i use all castor sugar or demerara sugar instead of the light  brown sugar?
what can be the substitute for molasses?
Do I have to use molasses?
Hi! I a vegetarion and not eating egg, so is there any method so I can bake all your wonderful recepie. please reply .  Ibwish you and your family a very happy new year.
Thanks for your all lovely recipes & Merry Christmas for you & your family
Could I substitute the molasses for golden syrup?
I made this last yesterday for a potluck dinner. I doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan and dusted it with confectioners sugar, applesauce on the side. It turned out great and was definitely a hit. Wonderful recipe. Thank you!
Yummm! On my to do list! ;)
Hi Stef, do you think it is a good idea to put chopped walnuts??
can I substitute the molasses? not sure if its available in Kerala,S.India.If so, what should I substitute it with and quantity. Thank you
What a weird. looking stand mixer,  I'm used to seeing colorful Kitchen Aid stand mixer. I guess I watch too much of QVC. Lol.
I really love baking! Thanks for your information!
You're the greatest. When ever I need a recipe, I don't even bother searching for other videos, I always type in what I want and add 'joy of baking' to the end. Never disappointed. Thank you!
Hi can I use gold syrup instead of molasses .
Yes Ma'am. That looks amazing. I bet that would be great served warm as a pudding with some custard!
Hi,thanks for your good and delicious recipes.If I want to back an upside down pear cake ,can I use this cake recipe over the caramel and pears ?If I can ,does it take time same as this or longer? Thanks in advance.
I've tried this recipe once, and it was delicious! Very moist and flavourful. A little hint though: it is quite sweet. So you might wanna reduce the amount of sugar. Thanks for the video demonstration and recipe!
Can i put raw ginger instead of ginger powder?
Can I make this using almond milk and gluten free flour?
can we use honey instead of molases
Do u need to use molasses???
I just baked this cake yesterday & it turned out very well. Thank you sharing. God bless
its really v soft cake  n moist really love it ,,thanks mam
I was thinking about making a gingerbread cake like this for a nice Christmas dessert, except I would turn it into a layered cake. Do you think this recipe would hold up to layering?
This looks great. Cant wai't to try it!! And she looked so guilty about the whipped cream. lol :P
Thank you -for another great recipe! It's delicious! I doubled the recipe as it's for a family gathering. I baked it in a 9x13 x 3 pan, and  I wasn't sure how to adjust the cooking time. I just kept checking it every 10 minutes after the initial 35 minutes, and it came great. Is there a standard way to bake cakes that have been doubled?
hi stephanie i can't find the firm packed  light brown sugar can i use dark firm packed sugar or better the normal brown sugar  thx
hello, can I divide the batter into small cupcakes ? what is the temperature and baking time then?
Thanks for the recipe. You looked very ashamed at the end with the whipped cream lol  You used a stick of butter and ton of sugar don't worry about some cream lol
It looks delicious, soft and moist.  However, it's not dark enough.  I prefer a deeper, darker cake and would defintely use the sulfered molasses instead of what she used.  I like a robust molassesy flavor.
Looks very nice as well as delicious.Is that a similar to sticky date cake. can use the butter scotch sauce?.
I have not made this recipe personally, but plan to! A friend brought it over for a group dinner and it was absolutely delicious! She used the crystalized ginger, and it makes a huge difference. Luckily, all forms of molasses are available (in Canada) as well. Thank you so much! This has led me to this website, and I'm very happy!
Tried this recipe. In the uk i couldn't find 'unsulphered light molasses' so i used what we call 'black treacle' and the end result is great. I would add 2 tsp ginger next time and a bit less baking powder because it bulged dramatically in the middle but going by taste its so good :)
You could just also melt the butter and whisk with with all the other ingredients if you don't have a mixer, right?
Hi Stephanie  I could not find molasses at my neighbouring grocer.. It has molasses sugar instead... Powder form... Can that be of use
I can't wait to make this! They used to serve gingerbread cake during lunch when I was in high school and I haven't had it since. :)
hello Stephanie, I just found the passion for baking and i was wondering if you have any good suggestions for a goo high quality stand mixer. thanks you a whole lot!
Yes, that cake texture looks fantastic. I just might have a go myself.
Stef, you know what to do? Mix one cup all purpose flour, one cup canola oil and one cup shortening , in the mixer . Mix until the mixture is white nice and fluffy. Put the paste in the glass jar , and then in the fridge. I'll stays for very long time 3-6 month. Each time you need to used, just brush the pan with that paste , and never stick to the pan.
I love sweets......I've watched your videos where colors of the kitchen and table are not brand new white and different. The image on the screen (your video) is a little too bright now for me to look for food and I want to see cakes and all (ingredients) more clearly.
Nice kitchen!, happy holidays
You are such a joy to watch!!! Thank you for sharing a part of you. :) God bless...
happy cristmas
thanks you ,going to try this
Love ur videos 😋😋
Shes canadian right? like her last name and the way she says out.. she so cute.. i like her videos.
can i use honey instead of molasses should I then use 1/2 cup or will it be to sweet.
Hi Stephanie, I'm looking forward to baking this lovely cake, but before I do, can you tell me why both white & brown sugar are used, as opposed to just brown? I confess it's always brown sugar and wholemeal flour for me, whenever possible! Thank you for all the wonderful recipes.
#CONGRATULATIONS! The spring and bounce that simultaneously occurred before your fork cut through the cake and after it was lifted out explained it all...What a lovely cake Stephanie; how smart and considerate of you to offer your viewers the metric measurements. You are so nice; I do agree with you about the whipped cream lol...BTW...I love your cast iron organizer rack...Where did you get that?
You are awesome this cake is wonderful thank you so much everything you do is perfect

Hello stephanie thank you for your videos I enjoy watching them as well as trying out your recipes. Are you planning to do a q&a new video for your fans? Also i would recommend you purchase a scraping bowl tool for your kitchen stand mixer, it would save you having to scrape the sides of the bowl constantly :)
Congrats for the new kitchen :) (y) i'm in love with all your recipes
Thank you for this recipe. It's just us this year for Christmas so this is the perfect christmas lunch cake. Now I need a proper citrus zester.
