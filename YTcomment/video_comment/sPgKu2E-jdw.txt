The music on his videos is similar to Good Mythical Morning's
and how do you suppose to answer the facetime call...
Good mythical morning theme at the end?
Staph cuz the song at end is from Gmm you filthy thief
The Dropbox 11x17 photos don't work. It gives me a 404 message when I click the link.
Ah, that ending was amazing... Lab coat trumps all.

How does the phone accept the FaceTime call when someone's in there?
2012 with this quality wtf

Hey i love your howloween phone idea but i have another idea that could make a lot of 💵💵💵💵💵.
How would you be able to see through the picture? The camera isn't on the screen where the eyes would be.
Haunt Former  you can maybe use this in the haunted mansion hallway! it looks super creepy!!
does this dude only do commercials
Can u do anything else than face time?
Omg ur in San Diego???
Cool vid. I did something like this with two small pinhole micro cams.
music from good mythical morning
who else realized this music is from good mythical morning
I have a sixteen digit passcode... Somewhere.
I wonder i i could use skype because i have andriod
You need 2 FaceTime emails -.-
lol thats the same music Good Mythical Morning uses.
does not own an iphone  :/
best channel on youtube
2:17 I just watched Rhett & Link!
WIN! This rocks.
great video!
The GMM intro song was at the end!
Rhett and link ooooohhhhhh nooooooooo
You sir are a genius.
That would cd so cool,if i had an iphone and a iPad?
I conveniently have 2 iPhones
GMM
The ending song is from Rhett and Link's GMM!
Great ideas.
yup!
stop beating up George Lucas, I think he's suffered enough.  His entire, brilliant lifework just constantly gets mocked and it's ruined his life.  I have a good friend that went to high school with GL, he said that GL was bullied mercilessly, like nothing he's ever seen before and he works as a high school counselor.  I find it so sad that once again, he is constantly bullied and it drove him to sell off his life's work...so sad.  Rise above people & let star wars ep 4, 5 & 6 go!
oh shit he saw me taking his Nintendo 64
If a thief tried to steal my N64 I'd go crazy.
1300 can turn into two extra cheap andriods, 200 bucks tops. And why stop at two?
do this in public
1:51 Is that the guy from the singles ward???
Great. Now I have to start worrying that the paintings REALLY are watching me.
that's why there's a text "*with $1300 worth apple products" XD
Can you show it to us?
trust me im wearing a lab coat
Royksopp!
Good mythical morning song!!!
You could use 2 iPods
That was awesome !
great prank if you have 2 iphones lying around....
How can u see through the portrait if the eyes are blocking?
Genius
Awesome!
Who was the other irritating, rage provoking, unnecessary comic-relief character? The one next to Jar Jar?
Lol random dog
Can I just say that this is my favorite YouTube station EVER.  Really.  No lie.  Geeks rule!
You did not include the creepy clown in the download.
DeVerl?
No joke, this is quite dope!
And you have to use an old brick phone to call for backup security because your iPhone is stuck inside the picture 1:24
The best picture is: Chuck Norris
you are so awesome
Yeah but it's still missing the point.
I was just mentioning that he was a few hundred dollars off.
That makes it so much more affordable as a practical joke.
Umm...iPads cost about $550, and iPhones about 600.
WHAT SONG is it in earlier part of the video?
you can also buy a $70 chinese android.
Lab coat = LEGIT.  I'm hooked!
I freakin LOVE your videos! So creative!
Omg guys, subliminal messaging.
Y dont u sell the hole rig and all that?
Did you take the picture of the Goodwill store? If so is it in the one in Houston near River Oaks?
has an iphone 4 and an ipad but someone breaks in your house and steals a 64 and you use a phone from the early 90's to call for help. i gonna love your videos, great job!
U have a old phone dude
The beginning is too hilarious!
Woohoo corporate espionage! Haha awesome idea mate :)
it's not like people are going to buy an iphone and ipad just to do this lol
But the front facing camera is covered by the picture!
Gmm??
Good Mythical Morning song at the end?
you only need:  $3 frame $1 cardboard piece $1 tape $700 iphone $800 ipad
It'll be sad if the thief steals it xD but awesome video! Really cute and funny :3 Can't wait for all the comments that are like "Ugh rich jerks and their multiple Apple products." XD
dude that is epic :)
You are so creative... Wish I had an Ipad or an Iphone for the app or a phone worth over 20euros still... cool stuff
hahaha what if the thief isn't scared and steals your ipad from the picture frame XD
forth
I was so confused as to why 'Mark Rober' was in my sub box.  Hahahaha.
O_O
