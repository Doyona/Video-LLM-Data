I just tried this and it worked great, thanks!! 👍🏼 Now I can make a natural blue and purple cake for my son for his birthday!  I boiled the cabbage for 10 minutes, boiled the leftover water for 20 minutes to reduce, and that worked! I added a little less than 1/2 tsp of baking soda to make dark almost navy blue.
This is a brilliant idea thanks !
Can you freeze these for later use for the colors?

I came here to learn how to make green coloring because i need it for my camouflage.
Woww
The problem with red cabbage is that as soon as you add that dye to anything acidic, it ruins the blue color. I've seen that blueberries with an acid added turn blue.
Hethie
Fantastic...I also don't know how or why folks are using fake coloring anymore. Thank you! Nicely presented!
good idea

You saved my day I was thinking of preparing some colour full sweets for Christmas but I don't want to use the artificial craps. Thanks a lot.
Perfect video thank yok 👍👌
is the rice got bitter if you mix it??? tnx
These are awesome,  especially the way you make blue.     I studied the artificial colors/flavorings and are so bad for the human body.  They all cause hellacious side effects to people and it is even worse for children and the elderly.  Almost all learning problems can be traced back to chemical coloring and flavoring.
How do you deal with the bad taste that the baking soda leaves in the cabbage juice? I am afraid it will ruin any food i like to color with it.
Nice! Thanks for the great sharing! Big liked! I used different plants to make  Natural Color Cookie : red, green, yellow , purple...welcome to take a look  if you have an interest🌹
I'll Be Using This For My Playdough

2018?
what food name
Still looks purple to me, blue berries are blue. By adding lemon, you can lighten the shade of blue.
Butterfly pea flower tea or Clitoria tea is actual a blue Flower, which works great too! <3
dat intro
I like your nails.
the last veg is radicchio, not a red cabbage.
color are colorful, less color are colorless.
Once it thickens, how long can you keep it? Is it possible to freeze it?
2:30 Its time for my nerdy ass to explain why that happens. Red cabbage juice is a solution that can be used to identify if a substance is an acid or an alkali. Basically, it is an indicator.  When you mix this indicator with an acid, the shade of the liquid turns from a purple to a red.  On the other hand, i you mix this liquid with an alkali, the shade of the liquid turns from a purple to a BLUE.  BAKING SODA is alkaline, So if you mix baking soda and cabbage juice, it'll turn blue.  This is why the cabbage juice turns into a blue. It's not magic, it's SCIENCEEE!  EDIT:Nevermind I didn't watch the full f*cking part and now i look like an idiot
Will this work for a red velvet?
How long will it last

Also you can add lemon juice to the red cabbage juice to make a bright violet pink.

How do you make Black Natural Food Coloring?
I LOVE YOUR VIDEO!!! thank you so much :D i never liked the food coloring and now i can make my own colors for birthday and christmas cookies :3
Love this!!! I haven't tried this yet but definitely will. So the food you make with this food coloring doesn't taste like the fruits or veggies you use to make the food coloring with? How does that work?
Will it give a flavour
What an amazing video! Love it!
what to use for yellow other than mango?it's hard to find it in japan right now.. TIA :)
3:50 If anyone wants a natural dye that is concentrated, you can try what's called cochineal (also known as natural red #4, carmine, carminic acid). http://www.livescience.com/36292-red-food-dye-bugs-cochineal-carmine.html http://www.snopes.com/food/ingredient/bugjuice.asp

can i use this for macarons dough?
Great natural color I was looking for such ideas
Great natural color I was looking for such ideas
Great Video btw ! Thanks a lot for posting this !!!
I have a question. I've tried to make the red cabbage based blue coloring a couple of times. If I reduce the purple color as is, it works well. But if I add baking soda after reducing, that doesn't work. Also, if I turn the purple syrup blue first and then try to reduce it, it turns dark green. And some how I manage to almost burn it, and get grayish blue tinge in whatever I try to colour with it. Could you possibly post some qtys and timings for reducing the purple / blue color ? Since red cabbage is the only source of blue I know of right now.
Sorry for being a know-it-all but you use the word "sift" only for powdery things and "strain" for wet stuff :) just thought I'd tell you, other than that great video like always! xx
I like the style of the video.  It reminds me of a Wes Anderson movie.
cant companys do this /:
thx
Wow now I don't have to buy food coloring
What would u do for cake batter?! And can I use strawberries instead of raspberries for red?? And wouldn't the taste affect the flavor?!?
I love  your  videos
@ dulce can you use sliver beet to make green
Could we use egg for orange?
Can we use the colors to make paintings? :-)
Hi...gorgeous. ...do you think I can use the color paste on macaroon batter? Will it change the consistency? ? Thanks a bunch ;)
i found that the raspberries didn't colour my food properly
If I didn't concentrate the colors do I use potato starch like its shown at 3:30 ?
You're awesome!! 😋🍒🎨🎨✨
Could I add this to a lip balm recipe, and would it be sufficient enough to colour the balm.
*****  Would Red work with strawberries?
How long can it be stored? :)
Love your style, choice of music, and the little bits of scientific facts you throw in your videos! Thank you for sharing your recipes and techniques in such a beautiful way!
thanks for this great video presented so pleasantly! any idea on how to make natural black food coloring?
I just tried the blue one, super excited... But the water became green instead of purple... Any idea why? I finally had enough red cabbage...
whats the whith thing that you mix it whit
Can you please tell us what you  do so  magical with food  coloring
Are these sticky :/ I'm thinking of making a natural organic colored powder not a liquid :0000
when i figured out that food coloring can give you cancer i had to stop eating it i was miserable before i found this video now i am happier and healthier
Love how u make your videos so interesting !!
If I remember correctly from science class, the purple cabbage juice is a pH indicator. Cool stuff!
Do you cook the carrot juice to make the extract too? I tried but it looks and smells like carrot soup :-( strong smell but doesn't have the cream texture. Thanks for your video, I am trying to make natural colors for my playdough.
I love this! Thanks you.
can u make white food coloring?
Does it stain? If it does how badly?
can you eat it
great video!! I regret buying those synthetic food coloring! I should make my own from now on!
great easy video!! thank you so much!!! this really helped!! :-)
I love this video, it's really help me coloring food
Woooww. Super ideas!! I usually use just beets to make food pink or purple, but this is a whole variety. Thanks you :)
Hello, If I would rather make the concentrated coloring type, how would I store it? also how long will it last wherever it is stored?  Thank you
omg thanks
Can you use orange, cucumber, red apple ? I don't hav any off those things at the moment
Oh my God this is so amazing. Thank you lots!
Hi Raiza, I'm just wondering how to add blue coloring for macarons, or even for icing glazes? I heard that the color can fade during the baking process. How do I go about this? Thanks!
WHEN I SAW YOUR NAILS I WAS LIKE WOW AND I WAS HAPPY :) :] :}

This worked perfectly! All the food colouring in my house suddenly disappeared, and I needed some badly. Thank you so much!
Can you use strawberry instead of berrys
Pretty fresh food coloring. Thank you for sharing ;).
this is awesome! any idea of how to make black coloring?? ^_^
do the colors (liquids) have to be frigderated after using them if you dont use all of the color that you make?
What a great video.  Well made, entertaining and helpful.  I'm going to send a link to my mom's ezine readers.  Chemical food coloring is... what you said.  BTW I once tried dying cookies with beet juice but it did not work.
This is great, thank you so much!!  I want to make pretty colors and decorate cookies and cakes with my toddler, but do not want them eating the chemicals of food dye, so thank you so much for this!  I had some ideas obviously using fruit, but great I can use veg too!!
Cool
i aint wasting me magos oh helll no
Raiza, could you please tell me how much quantity in cups needed to make red/yellow/blue? How much does it produce?
I love this and am definitely never buying food coloring again

Gh
Ilikehrevedos
You're the best! I'm so gonna try this..
Is that the song from the tv show called "Helix"....gives me the goosebumps!! Such a freaky show!
It would really be nice to see these colors used like making a rainbow cake or cookies, my purpose for looking this up is to see away of making beautiful macaroons, in different colors and maybe with extra flavor.
This is a great video ! Thank you ! :)
Muito bommmmmm é melhor que ingerir esses venenos coloridos que vem em alimentos...

oh god, they don't sell rasberries where i live and if they did they are extremely expensive other than that it's snowing like crazy and i wouldnt risk my life to get red food coloring to make my sister red velvet cupcakes for her bday :(
I am quite positive that red cabbages is not available in our wet market nor the supermarkets. Do you have or does anyone else have a substitute for the blue?
Will it stain the blender
I am so happy that you show this. I like making colourful cakes etc. but I am always hesitant because of the foodcolourings. That stuff can't be healthy. This is cool.
Love it!  Vlw!
Where have you been all my liiife?? Lol so glad i found your channel. I love the more natural ingredients you use!
What can replace the raspberry and the mango? not sure I will find... Do you keep it in the freezer once it's completly done? How do I make the azure color?
can i do that with orange? and if i can how?
can i use it for rainbow rose meringue cookies???
Could i use baking powder in the bleu one
Can use grapes
Can I use it for making slime or something?
can you concentrate the blue the same way? and how do you make brown or black?
THIS IS the best episode thank you

Excellent video.  Also lemon juice does brighten colors and foods. Amazing!
Love it! Now I can gladly start making colorful desserts! I never did because I didn't want to use the synthetics at all. Very easy to follow, and I like how you gave the reduced option for liquid vs gel coloring. I really like how you designed the visuals as well <3
um,also can you use a hand whisk not an electric mixer?
can you also use white grapefruit?
That was the best thing to make food coloring

Great tips, thanks! I'll use those to color my pasta. I like making pasta at home and always wanted to make colored tagliatelle or lasagna. These techniques will help a lot!
Also, if I were to add some of red cabbage extract or beetroot to milk, will it affect the milk or just color it?
If I add baking soda to beetroot juice will it turn blue?
That's awesome! So cool~ I'm gonna try thid when I bake a cake <3
So pleased I found your video. This is so simple. Can't wait to try this out for a upcoming birthday party. Thank you!

How to make the blue dye concentrated?
haha "synthetic crap" ")
your so awesome i love how you said synthetic crap
I'm wondering if you put these on the fruit roll up tray of a dehydrator, would you get a sort of powdered version? Do you think it would be even more concentrated?  By the way, I love that you can freeze these in an ice cube tray. What a great additional tip!
can use that to,hair dye?,i mean the blue one,isn't the baking soda harms ur hair?
i wanted to make a red velvet cake! when i first made it with the powder coloring it tasted horrible!but when i clicked on this video to check out how to make the natural version, u said to use raspberries ! the problem is i dont find any raspberries here and strawberries arent in season! please help me out what should i do! :(

Thanks for this delightful & informative video!
That's cool and it won't change the tastes right
Olá Raiza! Podes esclarecer-me algo que não entendi. Estes corantes naturais não mantêm o sabor dos frutos ou vegetais? Obrigado! :)
amazing! thanks!!!!!!!!
Will it work if I use it to dip dye my hair? :D
Soooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad
This is very stupid like a donkey
does it work on cupcakes?
can you use other things to make the food colour like use beets and strawberries instead of raspberries?
HI, this is great. I use food color to dye the water I use to grow beautiful crystals and I wonder if using this method would it be possible to replicate what the regular food color dye does. I am looking for other methods because you only get 4 colors and even mixing the colors it is impossible to get some colors. Also it gets expensive as even buying the walmart variety it costs $2.00 for 4 quarter ounce teeny bottles. Really the money for these isn't the problem. I just want some beautiful exotic colors, but if i do try to use your method the coloring could not have any material in it. Any suggestions? I love this video your colors are so vibrant and I would love to get a crystal the color of your yellow. =)
Thank the gods I finally found it!  I've been looking all over to find a way to make natural food colouring in so glad I found this video!  Thank you so much for uploading!  I really appreciated! :D
Instead of raspberries can I use strawberries?
You said these colors will not impact the flavor of your deserts. How is that possible?
wwwowwwww ur a GENIOUS!
What is that powder
Hi Raiza :) I live in Colombia and here is so hard  find raspberries. Can I use strawberries? Thanks

Hi! How to make natural Black food coloring, please? Thanks!
How do you make black color please
Though i don't really agree with the dramatic "it's poison!" part, i really love your videos!!! I never thought another Brazilian would be the one to teach me how to make French macarons!! haha
The cabbage one was a really neat trick! I remember learning about it when I was little, but I never thought of using it in this way.
i wuv ur vids i missed u a lot when u werent making vids for a while qwq
Excellent vid. I loved it. How 13 people disliked this was crazy.
Hmmm. Can I use this to color white chocolate? I know I have to use oil based or powder food color for chocolate. I don't think this would work. Has anyone tried it on chocolate?
im going to make a thermometer for my science project, and im going to mix it with food colouring, rubbing alcohol and water. Can I make this for it?
Love it! Thanks a bunch^^
Cool.Instead of boiling it, you can dry it in the oven and then process it into smooth powder and it works freaking fine with the macarons
Can you reduce the red cabbage one? and how long it will stand? thank youu!
Can you make food coloring woth beets or would it affect the flavor?
I LOVE how you said "stop using that synthetic crap" lol
Thought she said jizz cloth xD
Hi
Love it!!!!!!! Definitely favoriting and liking this. :) will use it next time :) thank you!!!!
Will this affect  the taste at all???? Please answer
I think you should consider making a beauty channel as well ...what do you say?
works in macarons?
love your vids! theres always a surprise science lesson in it :D
Awesome!!! And then it burns LOL
with this effect the taste at all ?
I loooooove your videos. Please keep them coming! You are delightful!
why is my tap water with purple cabbage makes BLUE not purple!! I didn't even add soda!
but isn't it much more expensive?
Great video
SO COOL...my friend and I tried making natural food dye to make a rainbow cake and it turned out looking all burnt. I'll definetely use this recipe instead next time!
you are sooo awsome ...the blue on was the best
beautiful!
OMG you are so brilliant, can it be used for coloring macaroons?
You are so smart Raiza!
it would be nice if you could put names of the songs you use in your videos.:) you're awesome!!
but if the cabbage dye is a pH indicator, I can't use it in cake (i was planning to make a rainbow cake without buying so many colours) as it contains baking soda, right? :'(
This is funny, because I needed the colors brown, pink, and white
Gostaria de saber como você aprendeu inglês? ??
Greaaaaaaaaat idea! :D I have a question though! Will any of the food coloring taste of the ingredient used?
Such good editing! I'm impressed!
OMG!! Thank you, can't wait to try it!!

Love seeing other brazilians on youtube, especially making such good content like you do! Keep up the good work (:
Awesome tutorial :-)
Fazia muito tempo que vc não postava um vídeo. Achei que vc tinha abandonado o canal.....
So then what if your recipe calls for baking soda and you want to use purple that would yottaly change the color to blue
Beets are pretty amazing for red, too. They stain hands like crazy though.
Thank you frim france  :) but i dont understand what is this powder that make a blue color please ?
muito legal, Raíza! e eles duram muito, não é? já que estão congelados e só precisamos de um pouco deles pra cada receita.. ;)
Can I use this to color fondant and marzipan? I love this!
omg thank you! i was wondering how you got those colors for your glaze
This was amazing (:
You are amazing!
Brilliant! thank you :)
I do LOVE this tutorial!!! Since I don't like using food coloring either. Is there any other substitution for the raspberries?? I love raspberry but Those are really expensive and hard to find at where I live...
Thank you so much! I love all your videos. You're one of my inspirations. I've done the raspberry one before. : )

It's common to use Butterfly Pea flowers as coloring in Malaysia. You just soak them in water for a few hours until it turns the desired blue.
This is awesome! Totally gonna use it to make a velvet cake.
Genial! Adorei o video, não volto a usar cores artificiais nos meus doces :D
