How important is the rinse? I bought the mouth guard and the gel, but not the kit with the rinse.
0:00 hey, kandee! I think in the beginning of this video your teeth looks really white to me!
Still use this and love it!
Thankyou ❤
How long does it take to see a difference?
I watched this like when I was still in middle school or high school and I still like coming back to this video to help me remember how to do everything! I use whitening strips too occasionally but I feel like this encompasses the teeth way better.
I know I’m 8 years too late but honestly I hate England so much. It’s literally £25 here, which is equivalent to over $28 in dollars 🥲
It's a 8 years old video, my my!!
We have so many options today, and like many are just gimmicks. This one is just simple. I will give a try. Thank you.
Does anyone have a link to those mouth guards? I cannot for the life of me find them at Walmart, dick’s, target, etc.
Too easy ☺
Love you Kandee, sweet as candi are you to! 😗❤
Anyone tried it on veneers?
God says Go to Holy Bible.   Trouble Times ARE Coming!  Always Remember Jesus God bless
What do you do for your bottom teeth?
Please where can I get some
Should you brush before and after?  or is it like white strips where you want to wait an hour after brushing your teeth before you apply. Basically I'm asking what exactly you should do before and after applying this whitening technique?  Thank you so much
truth or cap?
What about the bottom teeth??
Do you do the same for bottom
Can we have a link? They’re on sale now for $5 if i got the right one
I use the same but I leave this in for 30 minutes 3 times a week. Works phenomenal.....been doing this for many years and get a lot of compliments of how good my teeth look.
You are very beautiful and you have perfect teeth.Kind regards Saffron
What a sweetheart you are!! I’d like to ask a question please, does this approach cause tooth sensitivity? I mean if you do it like you recommend it not every day or anything crazy but, just once a month or just at first? Thank you for your tip and I’m sorry to hear about your dad even if it was a while ago, may God and Christ bring you peace and comfort❣️💯
Not to sound dumb because I'm late on this video, but do I need a mouth guard for top and bottom?
Only on the upper teeth?
i watched this to see what it was about. as she was speaking  i was mesmerized and taken by her beautiful upbeat spirit and her embodiment of life itself  . the world needs more Kandee's .
I just come across your post,thank you I'm so going to try this out ;)xx
You have the best ideas...
“ wait till they’re all beautifully straight” me crying because my parents took a big shrug at getting braces for my stupid mouth
Best video on this . Thank you
Not sure how I got to one of her old vids but I can testify this is legit. I've had my teeth professionally bleached & also did this exact same thing. Although the cheapo mouth guard from Walmart I couldn't get to fit right so just used the one dentist made for me & used the dollar store bleach tube she used from kit. Dollar store sells the tubes & also the whitening pens work great!!! So for touch ups @ $1 can't beat dat!
Xgzg
Yes for sure that’s always been my truth sometimes just a smile will mean the world. We have no idea what that person has been or going through. Thank you again for sharing this video.
So you’re telling me I could’ve made my own 97 cent retainer instead of paying $80 for one WITH insurance!?
Great info
Can someone tell which chemical this product hai?
Can we do this with retainers?
What about the bottom teeth
Geez, you've got like the best teeth.  Good on you.
Loves it. Straight to the point , quick and efficient 🤠
Avoid coffee , tea , wine , jam . My Dentist offers free laser whitening .
Wow I’m amazed, 7 years later and they kept the price $7.97!
What about the bottom teeth?
My first YouTuber i watched! And I keep loving her! Started watching her more than 6 years ago maybe even way before than possibly when she started!
can never have too white white
Who’s here in 2021?
Did this just randomly pop up in your recommendations
How to do bottom teeth?
Where'd you get that hat?
I think this is the best tooth whitening video on youtube.
omg you got that goblet at the madonna inn
You already had them clean. So come on.
Didn’t work at all for me ☹️
The only products that Work & are Safe & are approved by Dentists are ALL Hydrogen Peroxide. Buy Hydrogen Peroxide solution for £1 in Boots in Britain. Dilute & use as a mouthwash for 5 minutes😊😊😊👍
Did this in highschool and my teeth was white.
I used this product on my teeth after seeing this video a few years ago and I still haven’t been able to rebuild my enamel back up to how it was before this RUINED my teeth, wish I never did it!
You rock
You suck
How do you do the bottom teeth
How fast does this work?? Actually 5mins or a week or so?
I need to remake my bottom tray the bottom one stuck together
I’m here from 2020 September 11 ....hello future commenters how did we do with the pandemic? How about the president??? Please tell me we did the right thing?

*** Free Shipping*** Teeth Whitening Strips/Tooth Bleaching White strip / Dental kit  https://www.ebay.com/itm/363083934622
Good video. Bad camera.
You are absolutely beautiful and extremely helpful.    I love that beautiful sparkly smile. You have a new subscriber. 🤗
I like these better than crest 3d strips  but i would advise if you are sensitive you may get chemical burns like me but i rolled some toilet paper like a joint and placed it beneath my mouth or else splurge a dollar or two for their plus white kid with their blue mouth guard and rinse   i actually like their jelly blue 💙 mouth guard works better for me.  The results show tho.  Good luck and happy whitening my future be as bright as her teeth 🦷 👄
Kandee, girl he was smiling because you’re hot, lady!! He liked what he was seeing!
Dayummm, I’ve been scammed  All these years I’ve been using 3D Crest Strips Wish i found about this first
Probably a stupid question but... So do i use a 2nd guard for the bottom half of teeth?
Price in PKR
I am going to try it. But, you didn't mention, but what about the bottom set of teeth? Do you clean the guard re-apply the solution and repeat the steps?
I thought she was Lights
you just lost 3,000,000 views by not realizing your camera is out of focus. Not hating. Focus you camera giiiirrrlll. Helpful video btw.
I have a retainer that's the same kinda rubbery material and it's already shaped to my teeth (I had braces and this was the temporary retainer I wore before I had 2 individual plastic ones made for my top and bottom teeth.) Would it be all right to use that for this whitening method or do you still reccomend a new mouth guard one?
has anyone tried this method with a black mouthguard ? I wasnt able to get my hands on a clear one
Step 1: have perfectly white teeth to start with
can i use plastic wrap instead of the mouth guard
TFS 💜
What a beautiful human being. Came here for a hack, now teary eyed bc of her message in the end UGH
They don't ship the teeth whitening gel to the UK is there an alternative gel I can use??
Learn to focus your camera
I tried to fit it to my teeth multiples times, but it only fit to the bottom of my teeth 😓 can someone tell me if it will still work?
What about your bottom teeth?
Wait what about the bottom set of your teeth?
CEO of not focusing the camera
who's here ? April 28th 2020 ..
Would using this if you have  enamel loss not be recommended ?
The truck driver story was a great way to close out..Thx.
Her teeth are brighter than my future
What about the bottom teeth ?
Here in 2020, 😁. But wat abt the lower part teeth?
Aaaaaand as soon as you drink coffee its gone
I don't like her
I freakin love Candy Johnson. Most of you might not know but she a popular makeup artist and I‘be used her videos in my class before and we’ve all commented on how white her teeth are.... and now I know why. I was looking up review of all those new LED light whiting kits which are $60+ Im going to try this first!
Crest 3D White is the best   https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AHAWWO0?ie=UTF8&tag=mv2517-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B00AHAWWO0
What about the bottom......
Am I the only one that almost drowned while doing this in the shower?
Wish she was my dentist haha
PSA: If you have a plastic retainer from braces, you can use that instead of the mouth guard!
What about the bottom teeth though???
She was damn hot in his 16s
Don't you need that LED light thing in your mouth for this to be effective?
Just ordered mine so excited to try it! Ordered my boyfriend and I a 2 pack each. For the top and bottom! I'll be giving an update!
Instead of using a mouthguard can I use my retainers?
Funny I should come across this video! This week I've had new crowns and my dentist had just tried selling me a retainer for £60 or $90 😂😂 I thought it was something special that I needed until I saw it was just a £2 mouth guard....... It's safe to say, they'll be getting it back!
You like showing off that pretty ass meth users don't you LOL I bet you're very professional with it
Is she married or we send her to planet Mars?
Hi How do get your pick lip? Thabks
😬😬😬
I trust her look joe white her teeth are omg 😮
I absulutly love her teeth,there so frickin perfect
What about the bottom teeth
She is beautiful...😊
GIVE ME MY RINGS BACK !!!
I smoke will it work for me?
What about the bottom teeth?
Love this, and I'm not usually interested in this sort of thing at all.  I am heading to Walmart for the ingredients, and I will be grinning all the way to the bank.  Thank you!
Loved the video,.is it me or i just missed the bottom teeth process?
Can you please make a video of how to protect after bleaching. For people how drink coffee ? Thank you .
How often do u use this ?
wait i saw this on tiktok
Wow beautiful once my braces are done ill shure try it thanks💕💕
Spend 30 grand on a new set
Americans.. Kettles are really useful and a lot easier than boiling water in a microwave or by a pan on the stove..
Has anyone actually used this and did it cause sensitivity?
What about your bottom teeth
That’s awesome,such a good idea,gonna try it soon!
what about my bottom row of teeth they just gon stay yellow 😳
So how do you whiten the bottom
Are you Ana...from Gilmore girls?
Can i just use my plastic retainer?
What you do on tha five min? You spit or you can swallow?
🤔😂😂😂😂😂😂
Don't change your teeth color. Everyone has a slightly different yellowish to white hue for a reason. Changing color can affect the teeth themselves and even damage them
for a video in 2013 this is some good quality 😌
Straight to the point
what if u have braces?
Me: cries in _Indian_ cause 10$ is still like 715 Rupees in Indian currency & I'm broke & none of this exist in India T-T
is this bad for your enamel???
That shit doesn't work for me
My braces could never
Thank you for this 🤩🤩
Youtube knows I’m going on a date lmao
Here to tell everyone that it really does work!! I’m only on day 7/14 and see a huge difference. Can’t wait to see the final results on day 14, tfs!!!
Can i use this product with a ”led lamp” för teeth whitening?
This comes up in my feed today. Thanks for sharing 😊 Love your brown eyes 😁
So what are u trying to tell me YouTube 🤔?
What if u have sensitive teeth?
All wrong.  1. That mouthguard is not snug enough to stay in without falling out 2. Professional whitening trays have bubble space on the front surface of your teeth for the product to stay in. Without them, the product will just squeeze out
6 years late but I’m going to try this
Is it necessary to use a mouth guard? I looked a few places and even asked but I didn't find any.
This cant be healthy.
Don't put mouth guards into boiling water, turns them into a ball of plastic goo.
When the whole video is out of focus.......
Arent you doing the bottom teeth too
this girl below me was not even funny
Do they still sell that at Walmart because I just checked the description and it said the video was posted in 2013! 🤔😓
Six years ago
Does this get rid of brace stains?
ok i have to say that i just hate american smiles. they have all unnaturaly white teeth and it is just terrible to see. i preffer natural white teeth not this whitened shiet
Day after your dad died.. I understand.. So sorry. His blood is in your veins..always with you till.. We are all in heaven. Never to part😇🙏
Love it thank you
Thanks Girl my teeth need it  badly, Great info I'll let you no how it goes,💞😜
I'm not even in America !!!
Your teeth should be ivory, not white.
The message at the end... ❤️
PRINCE HARRY ABD MEGAN  HAS THEIR DIVORCE CONE THROUH YET?
Lovely message at the end.
she rocks the hairstyle with the hairband
Is YouTube okay? Why is yt suddenly recommending me videos from last century?😂 Not that I'm complaining.
Been subbed forever! It’s 20202 and ahh still love you!
Is this still relevant? This video is super old.
..but it comes with a mouth guard why buy another one even if it is cheap
Isn’t that tray thing kinda like a Invisalign lol? Like I can wear it to fix my teeth
Is the teeth whitening gel available on Amazon?
What about the bottom row do you do the same thing for those teeth as well.
*I'm* *offended* *youtube*
I tryed but my tith become sensible
Thank you so much for this video!! I’ve been looking for something like this. God bless!
U can't insult my COUSINS😡😡😠😡😠😠😡😡😠😡 nor my frnds
You are Awesome! Just found you and feel so blessed! I found You through jess and Ro. Tfs!
Where can I buy the gel im in england
That's like making your own invisalign lol
You Are Absolutely Sweet Genuine N Beautiful ❤️️🌹🌹🌹❤️️THANK YOU SO MUCH
Teeth are suppose to be yellowish, How much cancer is in there???
BRO TELL ME SHE DOESNT REMIND YALL OF LOLLY WHITEHILL FROM ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK. 😂
i can’t spit the saliva out without the tray falling out and the spit just goes into the tray removing the gel :/
Curious why not put the gel directly into mouthpiece instead of on teeth?
If you didn't have really white teeth anyways I'd be impressed, sorry
You can get kits for less than 10 bucks. What is she talking about?
Too long and difficult process for me
I know this video is old but I’m so excited it got recommended to me because I can’t wait to try this!  I thought for sure your teeth were veneers and never would’ve guessed they were just that white, they are absolutely beautiful......ty you for sharing this tip with us, can’t get to Walmart fast enough ( oh wow, first time I ever said that 😂)  Blessings 💜💜💜
This popped up in my recommended after I told my mom I want to get my teeth whitened at the dentist 🤔
Probably the most no-nonsense video I have seen in the last three years
I thought I was the only one that did that this video flipped me out. 😆 it def works lol watch ya dont burn ur gums been there not fun i dosed off with it in it sucked..
Where can i find it in greece?
I love you 😍
I’ll do this when I get my braces off but for now I’ll wait for about 5-6 years
She's so energetic that watching this at night feels like its morning outside
Than you for your generous tip on whitening teeth. Very kind.
Your teeth very white..i want kiss your lips
There's nothing wrong with your voice, and thanks for the whitening tip!
2013?! The quality is like 2020!
I just used those Walmart white strips for 20 days. Not too shabby.
1 word     spray paint
So I drank a little to much soda this year and they are super yellow and I have braces and a lot of these things you shouldn’t use with braces so if anyone have tips that are safe for braces PLEAASE comment them
I LOVE "PLUS WHITE" Tooth Whitening .....
who else here in 2020?
Does this technique also apply to bottom teeth ?
Thank you for sharing this video and your beautiful smile!
What about the bottom tooth?
So ... after all the years of using this, how are your gums and, how thick is the enamel now? Gums erode with age, enamel erodes with age, this stuff speeds up aging kids.
Finding this video years later and it pierced my heart with joy thank you ...❤️ loss my dad recently and this video gave me some comfort God bless you and your beautiful family
OOOOOW SHIT IM BLIND!🤩🤩
sonic-boom.se sells this! Fastest delivery and at great prices!
What about the bottom teeth? No mouth guard for that ? Just use the gel?
Great video. Smart method! I’m sorry about your dad!  🤗

How bad is this for your teeth? i am scared to trie.. maybe when your 50 its maybe damaged like hell and all your teeth fall out?🙈
Kandee:gets a glass of water puts in the microwave. Also Kandee :U just want it to be boiling.  Me:why don't we just use the kettle?😂😂
...BUT...How do you do the...Bottom Teeth ???
Hvorfor er kvaliteten så dårlig sker der Kandee
I looked for this video for to long. I saw this 5 years ago. So glad i found it!!♥️
Thanks
No one: Literally no one:  *Kandee: *starts doing intro with her mouth**
Can i eat with them
. . . or you can buy a bottle of hydrogen peroxide and gargle and rinse for about $.05 USD
Wow you are stanning 😍
Anyone get tooth sensitivity with this whitening gel?
What about the bottom of my teeth
Using a eating utensil for measuring is super inaccurate you have to use real measuring teaspoons (5 mL) or tablespoons (15ml). Otherwise great frugal tip.
God ur gorgeous
This is a Great Organic Toothpaste 👌🏽👌🏽💯...but who am I to help🤷🏾‍♂️https://amzn.to/2OSGAMT
Is it safe to use this every day ?
heat that plastic and get the bpa's from china.. enjoy
purtdy mouth babe
Hmmyou wouldnt have a before and after do you on your process?
Can we use retainers to whiten our teeth instead of the mouthguards?
i have really sensitive teeth. some say to use it once a week. the box says every day. does anyone know the real answer for sensitive teeth? thank you
Brush two times a day  Instead of doing this 😡😡😡😡
Thanks for sharing 😁 I'm definitely going to have to try this out. I was saving ($250.00) for my whitening kit from my dentist.
Has anybody applied this with sensitive teeth
I don’t have teeth so why am I watching this video!!!
Can someone share the music used in this video
how do your bottoms get whitened?
swear by this product . Also put on back of teeth as they are transparent
I just  hope this is not harmful
Yeahhhh. Awesome post. Thank u GF
Can you please link where you bought that teeth whitening product
She looks like the mom off of hunter street...
Not the best quality
Are you still as pretty?
I have custom trays I don't care enough to take the time to do It. There's the same $ tree crap to bleach. I don't smoke and teeth are naturally the color of bone, not actually white, more of a yellow.
The best way- a lot of light and more light , than even yellow teeth will be white 😂😂😂😂
Omg my teeth look disgusting so I’m happy I can across this
Can I use a hockey mouthgard
YouTube recommended: 2013 - nope 2014 - nope 2015 - nope 2016 - nope 2017 - nope 2018 - nope 2019 - YES!!!!!!
having white teeth is an important factor to looking good and creating cofidence,lately i have tried this teeth whitening kit and it has worked perfectly for me,hopefuly it helps others  :) ---->    http://www.lnk123.com/aff_c?offer_id=84&aff_id=431288
Kandee, great system that really works. I did not like the inexpensive Wilson sports trays due to thickness. I used some trays I had with an old Rembrandt system that is thinner. Do you have a recommendation for trays that are thinner than Wilson or sports mouthguards? I cannot get the Rembrandt trays anymore.  Does anyone else have a recommendation for thin moldable trays? Thx!
Her teeth is brighter than my future😂😭
This is a great video...but this is my experience. My enamel worsened when I tried this. I suggest just use crest whitening strips. Consider it an investment.

Why do i watch this when i have braces? 😂
DO NOT DO THIS!!! I tried this and my teeth literally felt like they were melting off, it hurt so bad
You remind me of a younger Diane Lane. Like your dress style & vid is cute :)
What about the bottom teeth
This doesn't work for meeee. WHY
I just brushed my teeth and then this popped up in my recommended
Thanks for your smile 😃 and thanks for posting. 👍
Ima just scrub lemon on my teeth tbh
PERFECT!!!
Would you recommend to under 18s because I’m 16 and my moms orthodontist said whitening kits don’t work and can damage ur teeth
what do you do if you dont have the rinse?
What about the bottom row?
MY EYYYYYYEEEESSS
how many times per 'year??' do you use it to mentain?
This is the best way thanks
Man to think I needed this years ago lmao welp it’s never too late !
Your teeth look marvelous darling!
This video is fake. She's a robot. Who else has such a perfect smile, skin, and perfect teeth?!
Just came across this. Loved it
YouTube recommendations: 2013:Oh hELL nAh 2014: Nope. 2015: should we- nah 2016: maybe next year 2017: ummmmmm maybe not 2018: no 2019: ... uGh fINe.!
I do realize the video is ages old but 1 thing she is gorgeous and I’m not even really into white women 2nd is that she’s at almost 4 million subscribers wow she must truly know her stuff imma try this whitener thing and see if it works and if it does I’m subscribing to her channel as well
focus left the chat
step 1: brush ur teeth
That end was so wholesome. I almost teared up a bit. 😭 I will aim to smile at more people. 😃
Do you have to use the rinse?
I apply my gel with a child’s paint brush so I don’t get it on my gums :)
Thanks your adorable!
Idk Why I am watching this in 2019 like if it’s not just me
What is she using to brush her teeth. Does that say Theodore
YouTube you silly shadow banning platform why did you feel the need to recommend this 6 year old video
JIZZ WHITENED THEM FOR SURE..DONT LIE
smileum.com rocks man for a few buks my teeth now are super white
How adorable are you!! Great info - thanks for the tip!!
Maybe this popped up in your recommendation bc you were laughing at a video and who ever was spying on you through your phone wanted to give you a hint.
It's 2019 and I'm a try and come back for a review 😁🤣
She looks like Kate Hunter (tooske ragas) from Hunter Street.
It annoyed me how this entire video was out of focus
Found this video 4 months til Christmas 2019 :-)  Love it!
I can't fine the mouth gard at walmart.   Does anyone have a link?
i love your subtle make up today can y ou do a video on it?
I love the message at the end it doesn't cost anything to give a smile and make someone's day you never know what someone is going through even a hello or good afternoon could make someone's day I live at then how you and your daughter bond that's beautiful God bless
When my husband died it was a smile I also received at the grocery store that made me smile and filled my heart ❤️  🙏
I'm doing this right now...wish me luck!
Can you use a retainer instead of a mouth gaurd?
Who the fuck heats up water in a fucking microwave instead of using a kettle?
my braces are screaming
The thing is I can’t tell if it worked or not because your teeth are already so white and I have used that gel and it worked pretty well but not that good
Or brush your teeth everyday
She sounds like lolly from orange is the new black !!!
Thank you 😁
Thank you💜
0:03 the black thing between her tooths is giving me anxiety
Thank you!
I was the Truck Driver that smiled at her...she Is So beautiful I couldn't help it.😁😍
What about your bottom teeth?
YouTube: *How to get really white teeth* Me: *eXCusE mE*
Or better yet... Oil pull. The healthiest way to whiten your teeth. Try it works !! Wish people knew the risks of these whitening products 🙄
Lately I’ve had so much video’s in my recommended where the comments are filled with “why the fuck is this 20 yr old in my recommended” youtube wtf is going on
Iv tried whitening and doesn't work for me
Going to try!
Wow it got real deep real quick at the end there...
ok but the message in the last part tho :((
Thank you for the video. Very helpful!!!   Also how long before we see results!!??
Your dad sent him to smile at you!!! He sent A refill of love back to your heart! That was super sweet.  God bless them both💕         It happened to me once.   Im usually happy and comical and full of joy.. well I remember one day i wasn’t....and a bus driver stuck his tongue out at me in a sassy kind of way when I pulled up beside it. I had tears from a break up. Not sure if he noticed but He said to me  “ smile, butt head” then smiled so big.   And I burst out laughing. It completely changed my whole day.!!!   🦋So you are 100% on that sister🦋
Can I use my retainer for this instead of the mouth guards?
You have some beautiful teeth!!!
Great video, I'm going to try this when my braces come off.
this just popped up in my recommended. is youtube tryna tell me something??
Use Vaseline on your gums so it won't burn your gums. The $ tree tree sells same type of whiting stuff. Actually backing soda & hydrogen peroxide is natural and works well.
I saw this video a few years ago and have been using this method ever since! Thank you!
So only my top teeth will whiten?😐
Every week?? Jes*s Chr*st. You're teeth will fall out soon.
hm. she could use some carmex
we love videos that pop up six years later in your recommend
this video is timeless. thank you for the simple hoedown like actually i love how simply you explain it
What if you have retainers
You're so cute
What do we do with the bottom one?  Do they stay yellow?  Not necessarily a smile means "I am in love with you or one like you"...👎
You sound just like the crazy white lady with circle glasses from orange is the new back haha
The shower is a great idea!
“I just apply it to my face like this or you could just apply it to your teeth” 😂
Can I use my Invisiglin instead of the mouthguards?
What a sweet woman
Welcome to a new episode of...    Why is this in my recommended?
Like your teeth aren’t perfect....  none of the cheap stuff works
I wonder if it really wrks
Gorgeous brown eyes!
Remember how you could use a banana peel to whiten your teeth
Ugh I have white teeth but when I talk they don't show for some reason.😕
But isn't this really bad for your teeth?
She sounds like lolly from oitnb lmao
Is there any fluoride in the whitening gel?
2019 anyone ?
aw! 1:42 the 16 yr old kandee
i have suuuuper sensitive teeth and can’t use normal teeth whitening strips without it being painful:(
That's the same whiting stuff I use! It works soooo good!
Just bought the items and tried it this evening - it was easy I’m excited to see results !!
How do you do the bottom teeth??
Thanks for getting to the point minus the sexual, lame pun jokes Youtubers make every five seconds that ruins the video. You are sincere about everything 💛👍
Putting boiling hot onto teeth no thanks
What do you do to the bottom teeth ?
What about your bottom teeth?
Ah the days this channel was wholesome
I FUCKING LOVE HER.
Thanks for your help!
You sound like Emily on Clifford the big red dog 🙃
Me watching this my gums hurts and my mouth is numb.💀
The end got really deep🤕
I bought everything but the mouthwash are they gonna get white 😕
....randomly showed up on my feed. Just realized this video is like 6 years old
You sound exactly like Lori Petty from Free Willy lol. 💜
What do you do to whiten the bottom teeth?  That's only for the top teeth.
There was something black in her front tooth in the beginning of the video
Doesn’t this make your teeth more sensitive tho?
U look like Sharon stone... so pretty
You are so bubbly and happy 😊 love your voice and your videos, thank you.
Well dang I thought I had a secret
Back when ppl were more real.. Down to earth.. Not all fake
I tried the Plus White...forgot I had it for awhile now. Used it once but didn’t really follow instructions 🤪. Got good results after watching your video and following your instructions. Thank you 🙏
What toothpaste do you use
Why not show a before and after. I use backing soda and peroxide.
You are adorable!!!
Say what!??
You are too cute young lady. God bless🙏
Please tell me the name of these products
Your teeth are veeery pretty!!
Great vid! Thank you! 😃 One question though, after you've put the mouth guard in the water and it's wobbly, how long do you leave it in your mouth to form around your teeth?
Wondering if anyone with super sensitive teeth has tried this method???
Does it matter if it's clear or black?
You just got a new sub!
You are so cute!  You and your personality would be great at commercials!
I live in tye UK ( Scotland ) is this on amazong uk or anywhere similar? hope you see this
Yo ur teeth so brighte it hurt my eyes
My mouth is foaming but its working
They always have simon Cowell teeth to start with lol
Hi; very smart trick shaping that mouth guard. can you say whether or not that product will get rid of tobacco stains? Thanks
OMG..was about to catch a sale for $$$99bucks,,at home kit ..for the 4th of  July holiday special...Youtube has some really good DIYS..THIS IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE SO  FAR!!!!!!..THANKS KANDEE
I’ve used this and it works very well
EXCELLENT video~~~ I'm wondering if this will help whiten my caps.... the dentist says it won't. Also, I drink 2-3 cups of tea a day.... I hope it will remove tea stains!
But what about your bottom row of teeth lol
Braces ruined my teeth, worse than what they were before and I have so much residue from the cement and that’s why  Y teeth are yellow looking because of the brace glue 😞  my teeth are so thin I can’t use whitening strips even the sensitive kind.  Sucks because my teeth use to be sooo pretty my mom would take pix of my smile lol now they’re crooked, stained, chipped, see thru on the ends from being so thin and to top it off,  brace glue on them all!! So much fun 🙄
I appreciate this!
Does the mold fit the bottom teeth
I wish I could use this stuff or any other I get sharp pains apparently in the tiny cracks😖
question,, can i put the paste in the mouthguard then put the guard into my mouth?
New subbie!!😁
What about the bottom teeth ?
What about your bottom teeth?
What about the bottom teeth?
Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou from. Kenya
For a whiter, brighter smile, AxisGlow.com
Anybody else notice how beautiful her eyes are😍?
Beautiful! Thanks you
My condolences
I used to work at shopping center where I was doing exact same for the people. One of my clients used to spend around 200$ for exact same treatment. It’s very easy if you do it at home,much cheaper and results are the same.
You sound like the brunette from Two Broke Girls!
you're honesty really beautiful
Saving you dollars and making Cents!
please learn how to focus your camera
Great tips 👍🏻
I use this too, I actually add it to my toothbrush every day with the toothpaste. I'm going to be 63 and my teeth look pretty good.
"Swirl it around in your foncy goblet" 😭😭😭😭
Who else noticed a black stain on her teeth in the beginning only me? Ok....
Great video, but when I use that whitener stuff it makes my teeth hurt so bad!  So sensitive I can't hardly even eat when I use it. Gave you a thumbs up anyway.
i looked on amazon for the Theodent toothpaste.  it has whitening in it.
Good vid!
You are my new Hero. Let me know when you come to Salt Lake for Holiday. I will be your UBER driver
Yesss!!! The world need smiles!!! 😍
You shouldn’t be using teeth whitening it’s bad for you
🍃💗hmmm.. but what about our bottoms?🤓💗🍃
I drool a lot during this. Is that normal? Like a LOT
Is it fine if it touches the gums?
Love this - thankyou!!
The tip is use Plus White. You're welcome.
What about the bottom teeth?
I used this exact method for years. Same product too! I always did it while I was doing my makeup every morning.
When you were 16, already your teeth  were white!!!!!
how dos the hot plastic not burn your gums?
She looks like Debby Harry from Blondie when she was younger , pretty girl nice frugal tips we can all use
outstanding Video,!!!! thank you soooooooooooooooo much sincerely.
I have 4 caps, does it work on them?
OK I totally just subscribed
What about the bottom?
💙💙💙
Tried the Wilson teeth protector and formed a perfect fit just like you said. Great Job. Tried the whitener, But I guess its going to take me a while to get white teeth. Great Job!
I've found that charcoal powder works really well as well.. Got mine at CharcOral.com
I love your presentation down to earth God Bless you
How long does the mouth piece last? Do you wear the top and bottom mouth guards at the same time?
This stuff really works! I have been doing this for years and I am always being asked about my whitening process😄
Who else saw the black stuff in her tooth
Can you use this as a retainer?
Great video will be trying this
I loved your video it was good 🙂 I recently started using a teeth whitening pen and it made my teeth white! I made a video about the results I got from the pen 🙂
From now on when i think of blurriness, I will think of this video. No for real: are you use these non stop or only a few weeks a year?
😁
It works for men as well right?
Thank you
Νοne of these exist in Europe
Erm..... Boil a kettle?????
i hate living outside America omg i can’t find any videos about products that work from our stores
Its amazing ive used this for years and i am witness the results are incredible !!!!
I would love to see a person aged 60+ who has been drinking coffee and red wine for 40 yrs where this works.
No one: Kandee at 0:01 :      😂😂😂 sorry y’all no hate ❤️❤️
I want to be aware of cleaning teeth.  https://teeth-whitening7.blogspot.com/
Nobody has white teeth. It looks fake. 🤦‍♂️
She sounds like such a sweetheart aww
Notice all these comments for Smileum are people being paid by them to comment ona  teeth whitening video. That action alone speaks volumes about the kind of conpany they are. 🙄Wish Kandee would delete their comments.
2019 💯💓
I love her personality. She seems so cool
I don’t see a difference, your veneers are white before and they are the same colour after?
Used this for years and I can say that it works very fast!
The last time I saw something this white was at the KKK rally.  Just wow!
Omg she farted at 2:05
Thank you.
White teeth are racist. What's wrong with black or brown teeth?  RACISM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But then I get a skincare ad.
You only use the top teeth with that mouth  guard
her teeth are brighter than my future lol
The beginning of the video just said: 👄
What’s the name of the mouth guard ?
what toothpaste do u use? lol
Love it thank you
Too fast I cannot see what toothpaste is here. Urgh beyond frustrated.
My plan is too try these products..I'm excited!
As I reflect upon my old pictures, I thought that my teeth will be the reason for having less interactions from colleagues in the office. Ever Since I began making use of this whitening teeth guidebook “fetching telam site” (Google it), my confidence has leaped and I`ve even been promoted. I do not believe that this informative guide would be the sole reason for it but I’m positive that it helped..
Does anyone know, if they have this tooth whitening paste in Britain.. is brits don’t have a wall mart🤔
smileum.com is way better and super cheap
smileum.com rocks man for a few buks my teeth now are super white
Plus white really works
7% sales tax were the days. Now it’s over 9. And I’m pretty sure the mouth guard is over $1. Thank you for sharing this. I might do this with those whitening products that are for refills with my own guard.

You’re so pretty! Beautiful smile too, need to get this from Walmart soon.
Loved this! Thank you. And you are a delight, Kandee! I do have a question....how about the bottom teeth?
Hello Kandee, just a quick question please. The link you put to get the gel bleach  for Amazon, is it exactly the same as what you use? I know its call the same.. Just looks different, I wanted to make sure with you first :) Great video, I love how you take us right through the steps, your the best.
Just tried to buy on amazon but they don't deliver to my location ;(
Hey y'all.. I'm in Ontario and Walmart doesn't sell either guard or Plus White so I am going to buy it on Amazon. I was wondering what the exact name and brand is for the mouth guards. I am a small person so I will probably get the one for youth lol
Genius
Love the color of your eyes! Thanks for the tip.
Thank you so much this  really works and it's cheap lol
Hey can someone please confirm if this dosnt Ruin the enamel or strength of it?? Only reason I’m not doing it is because it might damage the strength of my teeth. So anyone ???
Do I need new glasses she seems to be out of focus part of the time.Will this stuff take the stains off of 35 years of coffee drinking teeth? Mr. Ed has better looking teeth than me! (the horse)I have been rinsing my teeth every evening with 3 or 4 beers and I haven't seen them get any whiter!!!I do like her video style - direct and to the point. Good Job Kandee!
I'm gonna use the mouth guard thing she did as retainers xD
Her teeth are brighter than my future 🤣🤣
how long does it last
Thankyou so much for this helpful tip i will be trying rhis
Can my teeth get THIS white with just this product??
Wow all that information in under 5 minutes - finally a youtuber who gets to the point :P

By far the best option for teeth whitening I’ve seen so far
Kandee.. pleeeease what’s this lipstick colour??? It’s perfect😳👌🏻😍😍😍😭
Would you do it on the your bottom teeth the same way, or is there a different method?
Wow, you just made a retainer with a mouth guard. How have I never thought of this!
adventures of alhaji musa season 1 https://bit.ly/2FaS0tI
I just watched this video 3 times trying to see the name of the product she used 😒😒😒 what is it!!! Lol
Can I do the bottom teeth without a guard? I have a permanent-retainer on the back of my teeth
are there any alternative products in europe?
So cute
So cute..
I’m drinking Dr Pepper as I’m watching this
My Teeths aren't yellow cuz I don't talk shit

Your teeth are so beautiful!!😳😍💗
For anybody who tried this.. does it really work?
Can this hurt your enamel?
Your eyes is so beautiful
So I have extremely sensitive teeth and I’ve lost a lot of enamel and I’ve really been wanting to whiten my teeth (but my dentist says most of the cheap methods like the crest whitening strips will make my teeth even more sensitive so I haven’t tried them) do you think I could try this, or would it weaken the little enamel I have left? Thank you!
I'm try to find a way to keep my teeth clear that I'm 13
or... we could all be smart people and BRUSH OUR GOD DAMN TEETH.
All good
Great Video. Thank you for posting.
What a great DIY video.  You are awesome Kandee!
If my teeth were perfect I would try this but since I have a snaggletooth i'm not sure if it would work =(
what about the bottom teeth
Making large amount of cash within a couple of hours every day has always been my dream. Consequently, I tried to apply various methods and techniques to have success. I`ve found out “Kαwοn Sizo” (Google it) froma good friend. Today, my every day income may go over a hundred bucks. This strategy is truly efficient. I`ve acquired great outcomes because of it.
2018 and trying to get white teeth? No? Okay I'll leave now 😂
Can’t do this cause braces... rip Edit; oh damn she mentioned that, thanks gurl
Great info Kandee as always thanks for sharing ur beauty secrets and your lovely smile :D <3
I have the best product for whiten teeth which will take no more than three minutes and it’s 100% natural. And what she is doing if you keep doing it your whole do you think I’m a fall out down
Those teeth are brighter than my future
beauty guru.
Whats the name of brand
Just curious but wont that mouth guard burn your mouth and then sucking that in from the hot water?  I find that using Crest whitening toothpaste keeps my teeth white also but not as white as yours. Im a coffee drinker, but it does prevent it from staining.
Why dont we have these products in Norway? 😭 i want it so badly
Umm anyone else wondering how she gets the bottom row of teeth white? Lol
is this kinda the same thing as Crest white strips except cheaper?
Thank you for sharing. Nice video. What how to straighten your teeth for cheap, you think you can share?
Teeth so white 😁
I really don't want to sound rude but what is that bump on your bottom lip? Pls don't drag me I'm just curious :Dd Ily Kandee❤
You should be an actress or model
Love you for this video ! 😁
Her teeth super white
0:04 pause and look
Omg I loveeee your voice
Can I use aluminum foil instead of a mouth guard?
This is very helpful for every person
This helps but my teeth arent straight...my family cant afford braces 😖
You’re mom gay
Can you put both guards in at the same time?
Beautiful teeth!
Can this work for crooked teeth?
1:44 16 year old you looks like Kate Middleton 😂
This product looks like it works great! I love how you can mold the guard to your own teeth. Another great alternative to whitening is through natural remedies. Check them out!

What about your bottom teeth?
What about the bottom?
She didn't tell you that your teeth hurt very badly and very sensitive after applying for about two weeks and shedding your natural  annaml off
You look like the cute version of the funny woman from Mad TV
Thank you so much 😘 beautiful words.
First she says is all you need it the tube, then there is a rinse?????????????
Ridiculous
Sorry for your loss and thanks for the tips I'm going to try it out

what about your bottom teeth?
Can I do this instead of brushing my teeth or they not really the same
That’s very un professional of you for not showing properly the products you used😪. I keep posing the video just too read what’s on  the box
Those are the most perfect teeth I saw !!!!!!!
I am not sure why but this was just the best video EVER!!!! the cute kid at the end maybe?  the no b.s. just let's talk about what you came here for  and here's my credentials right off the bat too?  or maybe that damn perfect makeup on such a pretty face?
AWESOME THANK YOU!
my shining teeth and me
You sound like Lori Petty:)
WHITE EXTERIOR PAINT WILL WORK BETTER FOR CHEAP. !
What about the bottom teeth
I ❤️you Kandee!!!!😁✌🏼💕
GREAT video! Can you do the same for the bottom teeth?
How often do you whiten? Is it daily?
The camera won’t focus
thanks for this tip
You are naturally beautiful. I just saw your video. Thank you so much. God bless.
Why didn't she just boil the water?
Love the bandana look.
Such a beautiful smile!
Did this today, just bought the tube and the guards.   My teeth looked pretty awful, fairly dark yellow,  they lightened about 5 shades with leaving the guards on 20 minutes.  It says on the tube you can use for up to two consecutive weeks so gonna keep doing it daily until I'm happy with how it looks.  But after today, I look like I just came from a thorough dental cleaning.
I definitely am going to try this! Great info! And, btw, I love the gingerbread man mug! My kitchen is gingerbread decor. Where could I get the mug? ❤️
Dislike cause stolen video. You even copied her headband! https://youtu.be/2pFAr6hgIEM
Anyone else find it ironic how her name is candy?
Awsome
I leave a comment.
All the links to the products aren’t in the description, for example the rinse. I know this this is an old video, but I could use some help there 😊😊😊 This is one of those rare videos that made it to my BEST BEAUTY TIPS playlist 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Do you whiten the top and bottom teeth at the same time or separately? And you would need two different mouth guards, correct?
Thx
What about the bottom teeth??
Love you
Where in Walmart can you find the mouth guards?
If you have sensitive gums, you may want to use vitamin E on your gums, before adding the ‘bleach.’
Love this vid! Thx!😘✌🏼
Do we need to do the rinse?
the camera was less focused than me in class
Thanks for sharing your experience.
Nice, but is it safe for your teeth?
How do you know which mouthguard to buy?
http://kileyabbott.nsproducts.com BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER!! Whitening toothpaste without the harsh chemicals only $25!
You're amazing!
Superb
i teared up at the end awe :'))
I got a dentist ad before this lol
How to make your teeth white from yellow...    BRUSH THEM!!!
does it damage the layer on your teeth
I had some of that gel and its makes you want water
Best video ever! muah!
Your camera is focussed on the door lol
My top set of teeth is fine, but my bottom set has two teeth kind of “overlapping” each other. Would this still work for the bottom?
I bought this and now my bottom teeth are jealous, any solutions?
I don’t have a Walmart :(
Do you do the same for bottom teeth? (Lol I know this video is really old)
Awesome
Thank you Kandee, I need this because I drink coffee! 👍🏻💖💋

Man I have to get my braces of in 6 more months 😩😫
Tried to find it in the lower mainland walmart, and had issues, checked online, and it seemed to show something with no picture for 26. Checking on amazon. Has anyone found it on there?
I like that green goblet.
Anyone know where to find something similar to the Plus White gel in canada?
Your teeth were already freaking white
what do u reccomend for pugs? asking for a friend.
What if you have braces
holy shit it worked lol
1:43 you look like Kate Middleton!!!
Am I the only one wondering if she has veneers? People compliment me on my teeth ALL the time, it's really the only thing I like about my face/ body, but even mine aren't this white, the only this white kind of teeth I've seen are veneers.
Why did my gel turn into a liquid? Can I still use it like that?
Is this damaging for the enamel?
Omg, I love her spirit! 😄
Too bad I can’t find whitening guard in my country
Do I do this everyday HELPPP
*.*
It’s unsafe to use the spoon in boiling water because boiling water in the microwave will not make you see how warm is the water and it might be super boiling and you can’t see it then dunk in the spoon that might explode there is a video about this subject on YouTube
Why did the intro remind me of annoying orange...
You should try Novashine Smile! It’s a whitening kit and it works really well
Its too white :D
can't you just put it on over night
That's all fine & good, but how do I get my lips so kissable like yours? That is the question! Sorry 'bout your dad, I just lost both my folks. God bless.
does this weaken/hurt your teeth at all? bc mine are sensitive
I have this
Worth watching  https://youtu.be/6rPVq66I2rU
you don't have to wait for your te eth to be straight to have white teeth
Hey!! I have the clear retainers from having braces a few years ago and I was wondering if I could use those for the tray?
When she said it should get wobbly and bendy, me being dumb thought hmmm what if it melts on her teeth😂😂
I just use bleach,  works like a charm😊
What about your bottom teeth
Omg at 1:52 was that the 100 dollar toothpaste
Damn, Kandee is HOT!!!
Your video is ace! Thanks for the info!
Does the mouth guard work for the bottom also?
I know I’m almost 5 years late but idc, I have a question.  Does it weaken your teeth?  Thanks to anyone who answers! :)
Will this help make my crush like me
Wait, don't you heat up water in the kettle in the USA? Don't you have kettles?
The end of your video where you said a smile can change someone’s day is why I became a hygienist! I love smiles, they are SO powerful ❤️
How is this for sensitive teeth?
Your teeth look like annoying orange☺☺☺
Could you put the gel onto the tray first
Why do you put water into a mug of water into the microwave to heat it up. Use a kettle??
Any other new youtubers who want to support each other ? 🙏🏽❤️
Most of my adult teeth haven't came in yet even tho my baby teeth r gone. Can i still use it?
Anyone do this and get positive results?
Watching in 2018... thanks Kandee
All
I drink a lot of coffe my teeth are really yellow and im just to embarrassed to show my teeth but hopefully with this i can get rid if all this yellowness
Does bleach help? (Jk)
CUT OFF SUGAR OR CANDY YOUR TEETH WILL LOOK BETTER
Does anybody know if this will ruin the enamel on your teeth?
Kandee ... can I use aluminum foil instead of mouth Gardner? Plz reply
Bottom teeth?
Your voice sounds alot like Gwen Stefani
Does this really work ? If so how long does it take to actually see results? Thanks
I remember seeing this video when it first came out and going out and buying it and let me tell you, this is the best product I’ve ever used for whitening my teeth. I’m alwayssss getting compliments on my teeth and I can’t tell you how many friends, family, and even strangers to buy this because it’s soooo good. I get lazy so I don’t use it super often but the results last and I can go months without doing whitening and still get compliments. I highlyyyy recommend, and Plus White you should hire me because I never shut up about this product lol. Thank you kandyyyy❤️
What toothpaste do you use
I recommend this:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071L4RM6Z.   100% natural organic and fluoride-free!
YOURE FUTURE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT BRIGHT IF YOU CANT EVEN COME UP WITH AN ORIGINAL COMMENT.
She sounds exactly like Gwen stefani! Love her
😁
2018 anyone
OMG SOOO BRIGHT
Ew
Lol her teeth right there
Thank you for the videos im a fan of your videos imgonna try it I'm a coffee drinker. My dad just died i can relate
pretty white teeth
Your voice gives me Tank Girl vibes
Great clean video
Been using this for YEARS since I watched this video! Thanks Kandee!!
Sucks to live somewhere they don't have any of this stuff, or it's waaaayyyy overpriced
This Wilson mouth guard will do only the top? What about your bottom teeth? Great smile you have. Great video!
1:43 Caddy Herron?
Okay you are a great person
Has anyone with sensitive teeth tried this??
did it work on dark yellow teeth
So would you buy two trays ? One for the top and one for the bottom ?
just try Expert 38% Dr. Martin Schwarz best effect  https://drmartinschwarz.com/en/expert-38-dr-martin-schwarz-teeth-whitening-at-the-dentist/
Your face never changes! Just your hair (:
She reminds me of the arm and hammer woman
You're sooo like differently pretty like hmmm 😍🌚
What do you do for the bottom teeth
I’m going to try this hopefully they get as white as hers that way I can smile more
I love you videos, very precise and detailed. I love that you actually showed the receipt lol. Thank you much!!
thanks for the video kandee im gonna try it
Can you do this video with the newer packaging cause I don't think you have to mix water with the new one now but I just wanna know
This product is amazing! It worked after the very first application and removed stains I had had on my teeth for several years! I cannot recommend this enough- thank you so much Kandee! I love that this product works and is so affordable :D
your so pretty. thank you great great
DOES THIS DAMAGE TEETH
I love her voice
I feel like most of these people had glaring white teeth to begin with...
Damn she was spot on total came out to 9.59 at Walmart tried it out and my teeth feel and look cleaner/whiter
i tried this and my gums turned white!!
Has anyone tried using thier retainers if you have invisaline retainers ???
Going to buy all of this before my braces come off just in case they discontinue it hahaha
Hey Sandy !
what if you have a chipped tooth?
Thank you for this video. You have a beautiful smile as well as overall beauty.
Have you tried active charcoal yet? I get it at Sprouts. Supplement aisle about $10. Cut the capsule and brush your teeth.  Works better.  Better for you too.
Dentists must have given the thumbs down.
What abt the bottom teeth?
is the rinse necessary??
Awww cutie little doll 😍😍❤
i don’t know why, but i like her personality
She's pretty
Damn, too bad I got braces the struggle is real if I try this.🤦‍♂️
This actually works! I tried it after watching her video. And noticed a slight difference after the first time. (Well my teeth aren’t horrible but they aren’t as white because I’m a coffee drinker) Anyways I did this 3 times over the course of two weeks. I’ve been getting compliments from my family. I am amazed that it works so good !!!!!! And no teeth sensitivity at all.
Her eyes are freakin beautiful
Instead of the mouth guards.... could I use my essix retainer?
Omg you just earned a new subscriber !!! Straight to the point and upbeat personality!! Loved it
love your vids,  very nice personality and the tutorial was very detailed.
Girl, get the grip on your camera focus :/
I realize it's been a few years, but would you mind posting the eye and lip makeup you're wearing? PLEASE?? Such gorgeous, cool toned pinks, I'd retire my tanning gel to wear those colors!! 🙏🏻💋🙏🏻
on my channel you can find out how you can whiten them without hurting your enamel. Check it out if u would like to know
How do I get my bottom teeth? Same thing as top?
you got a man ?? 👀
Just a tip, the $0.97 mouth guards are in the sports section where the basketballs are in Wal-Mart! I couldn't find them at first either but that's because they aren't with the dental products (since the Wilson ones are generally used for sports). Hope this helped!
@Kandee Johnson how often do we use this?
My boi Filthy Frank's way is way better and cheaper =/     SpRaY pAiNt ThEm
White, White, White! WOW, this really works, my teeth are like super white now! Great video, and my what a cutie you are!! Thanks :)
Can we use that tray you molded again?
What about the bottom part?
2017
Thank U so much!!! This really helped me
16 year you is just like Kate Middleton.
Going to try this out as soon as i finish up with my white strips :) only thing I do not like about the white strips, is their inability to get the whole tooth :) thank you for this video and from the bottom of my heart, I'm truly sorry for the loss of your father..  ❤️   And you have a gorgeous smile
Your teeth are so white!!!!
Do u still brush ur teeth
what about bottom teeth
Just as I expected. PHONY.  Does NOT work. I went through an entire tube of Plus White gel (doing everything this video shows). And I didn't notice my teeth looking any more white than ever. Or should I say, any less yellow. This stuff also kept making the nerves in my teeth hurt. This woman probably really had her teeth professionally whitened. No over the counter whitening products makes teeth as white as hers.
Note: I put the mouth guard in a cup of water for 2 minutes. It melted. 😂
So crazy how much you ripped off this video it's like didbt try to hide it at all. https://youtu.be/2pFAr6hgIEM
I AM SHOOK 😱
I want to whiten my teeth for homecoming which is in 6 days I don't think ahead lol. Has anyone done this? If so how fast did you get results?
And so you leave the bottom row teeth yellow ?
yay  I just got my braces off & white teeth for less than $10 bucks I was ready to pay over $500 to get them whitened
didnt work for me
How many times a week do we do this?
I used to whiten my teeth with baking soda and lemon or lime. Worst thing every because it burns your gums. So I tried several other methods but decided that getting that super white bright smile is not healthy because the natural color of teeth should be somewhat yellow.  I try to maintain my teeth more than brighten them. Check it out here    http://www.lnk123.com/SHiOF

Her: less than 10 dollars Me: *scratches head* damn that's a lot
I loved this video. I am in bahrain.. where do I purchase this? Can u tell me the price.. plz...
Thank you for bringing this into my life. I hate how my teeth aren't really white.. I did it for 20 minutes today but I didn't really see a difference. Please tell me it gets better? LolI love how you didn't talk about random things. IT was straight forward and helpful. (I loved molding the retainer. XD)
I used a fine 100%  baking soda I found at Whole Foods and dab it on with very hot  water - be careful not to burn the gums and my teeth  whiten nicely. Worried about using these chemicals on my enamel. Once you ruin your enamel - it is all over.
Hi which toothpaste will you recommend?
I'm 13, can I use this? I've always had such a complex with my teeth.
Do you still use this?
Thank you for this video!!!
What about the loert teeth
I just brush my teeth with tooth paste fuck all that shit
I'm so excited to try this without spending a ton for the same white smile
Okay so this is a dumb question lol I'm just wanting to make sure (and since you're a former orthodontist you probably know the answer) but I got a mouth guard for soccer that I never used from my orthodontist, it's the shape of my teeth and everything but would it be okay to use it for this? I have braces but only on top so I'm trying to get my bottom row white. Thanks!
This product really work.why i stop is because it weaken my gums.but it works
Does it burn your gums?
instructions unclear, my foot is stuck in the ceiling fan.
Her teeth are more white then the color white....
You sound just like Elora from Spyro 2: Ripto's rage, especially during the voice overs.
I can't floss parts of my mouth because there is a permanent retainer in my mouth
damnit i was so excited to do this and then i realized i have braces😂😂😭😭😭
Thank you,very educational,and yes smiles are great & contagious.
You're so pretty❣️
I hate to tell you but that truck driver was a perv
u hav a beautiful smile
Can you use it without the rinse like can you just use the gel and then rinse w water or your reg mouthwash
This girls teeth is brighter than the chance that Destiny Child WONT get together
You sound like my old dentist
I'm sorry to hear that about your father, it's wonderful that you still preach smiling to the world!
she sounds like lolli from OITNB
My video is still loading so all I'd like to say it Hi!, I hope you have a good day,night, or afternoon! Also you look great! Here are some flowers🌷🌸💐🌼🌹🌺🌻
Can you do this with braces
I can't believe Gwen Stefani is teaching me how to whiten my teeth
I hate short hair on girls
She's so cute awe
The things I'd do to 16 y/o Kandee...
she has that toothpaste that has a chocolate flavor to it I forgot who invented it you can look it up
I love that "fancy goblet"!! where did you get it?
Does this work better than whitening toothpaste???
She looks like that women empowerment girl
Hi there - I work for Plus White. We'd love to discuss having you do a testimonial for our brand if you have any interest!
I remember watching one of her videos back in 2010 when she briefly mentioned the PlusWhite in a Q&A! I went out and bought it that same day, and here I am still using it 7 years later! It's an amazing product and soooo inexpensive, thank you Kandee! <3
She's so cute
Nice
Doesn't the whitening gel get pushed up to your gums after you put the mouthgaurd in?

What about the bottom teeth
With 3.8 millions subs and over a billion views in total. You must get professional whitening.
heath  is great
Do i need 2 mouth guards? One for the bottom and one for the top and use the same method for the bottom?
<HTML> <B
OMGGG your teeth are beautiful
Can someone tell me what lmao means
Or just brush your teeth 3 times a day.
or you can just regularly brush your teeth?
Are you a model
You seem so nice I would have liked to have had you as my orthodontist
Please Answer... How old do you recommend your age to be to do this?

THANK YOU
Her teeth so white they'll shoot up a school.
wow you wore so cute back on the days, maybe 1970S
Diane Keaton look-alike
sadly this didn't work for me. i even think it may have made my teeth darker in some spots.
oo mg u were so pretty at 16
Thank you so very much for the happy and right to the point whitening tip. Please can you tell me , honestly about how long would it take a person to get their teeth a noticeable difference of white it this would be the 1st whitener you have ever tried and if your teeth are a normal white and taken cared of? How many time using this product and your tip to get your teeth say, 3  times whiter? Thanks again.. :+)
Can I use my Invisalign(invisible braces) as the mouth piece?
those teeth gards are around 30 to 40 dollars at the store near me
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/142387163957?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649
Great I have the gel , just need the mouth guard.
, Did Anyone Try This?! & If So How Great Or Bad Were The Results.?
I enjoyed this very much ! ❤️Especially the ending !!

Haven't tried her method, but I have been whitening my teeth at home for years for even less $$$. *You can't do this more than once a month or if you have sensitive teeth!!!* Get about 2 tablespoons of baking soda and pour on enough peroxide to moisten it into a paste, I use my toothbrush to mix it together. Brush your teeth with the paste for about 30 seconds, then rinse your mouth really well with water. This also keeps your gums really healthy. My dentist said I had the best gums he had ever seen and asked what I had been doing. When I told him this he was totally shocked but warned not to do this more than once a month because baking soda is abrasive. It's very easy and surprisingly dramatic results.
so, is there flouride in the product?  how about glycerine?  sulfates?
OMFG I WANT THOSE TEETH
Omg you are rich your toothpaste
What about for dental implants can that work ?
OH my word. Did I literally just watch how to make my own retainer?? LOL
what about your bottom teeth?
so you need 2 mouthguards for this to work?
Same thing to the bottom?
Is it still effective if you place the gel inside the mouth guard and THEN place it into your mouth? xd
thank you for this video! my teeth are semi white...I usually use baking soda...but this is also a good cheap option
I just bought this today! I can't wait to see the resuts
will this make my teeth sensitive ?
I love when people get right to the point. Some people sponsor companies and talk about their friend's videos so I thank you 😊
What about bottom teeth?
this actually work, it makes your teeth very sensitive afterwards, I used this while  going into the shower then get dress rinse my mouth before I leave the house, then I put my white strips on when I reach work I rinse my mouth again then remove the strips.
Omg I'm so happy I found your video!!!
Can kids that are 12 old do it too or not
That's interesting!
Do ya even know how to focus the camara
Why on earth does she say "celebrities and people" wth THEY'RE PEOPLE TOO!!!
When you talked about how smiling means so much to people at the end I was so happy. it's so true. one smile can turn your whole day around for the better. I'm also very sorry for your loss.
THIS IS MY HOLY GRAIL. I've been using this for three years and my teeth are so white. i'm so glad i came across this video thank you so much.
Did anyone else get bothered by the beginning because it wasn't focusing
I'll try the cheap method and let you know if it works
My teeth are so badly stained in the front of my teeth but the back is extremely white
You did a great job !   I like it !
does anyone know if this will hurt for sensitive teeth?
a smile do can make someone's day....😁
that's cool
So can you make a guard for the bottom teeth as well.
I liked the Mozart's music on THIS teeth video,it fits it.
I live in the city; thus no Walmarts around. Can I order these online or are they somewhere else, too?
What about the bottom
raw organic unrefined coconut oil.
Hi love your review.  One question you brighten your top teeth and what about the bottom.   Can we also do our bottom teeth like the top procedure.   Will you let us viewers know thanks God bless.
Does it hurt or make your teeth weaker in any way cause some have side effects
are you supposed to get the whitening on your tongue
OMGGG I LOVE YOUR HAIR!!
I'm in love with her teeth❤👌🏻😍👏🏻
could you do this at the bottom too
Please take your camera off of autofocus lol
Or you could just order my whitening fluoride toothpaste I sell. So much easier 👍
Do you also get another mouth guard for the bottom teeth as well?
Thank you Kandee! It's true about the smiles from others.
Can you do the same for the bottom teeth too?
I'm the newest comment in 3 months
This worked great for me, I put them in for 20 minutes and my teeth didn't look yellow at all. How often can I do this?
so...much...effort
Or you can be like me and have insurance that covers it 😎
What if you live in England???
I have braces ;(
Your teeth look fake as fuck
At 1:02 I was about to die from laughter
LOL, you had me at "I just got these football mouth guards." xD
Kandee, you show the football mouth guard for the upper teeth. My football mouth guards included upper and bottom. Was the bottom guard left out of the video? If not, could you please clear up my confusion? Thanks.
GREAT SMILE!!!
I agree! SMILES mean SO much!!!
Can you do this with braces?
i am a very new fan. i love you already. you shouldnt have to thank people for not minding the sound of your voice! good people accept people no matter what. your voice never stood out to me until i read that. you look beautiful and i cant wait to try this
I got a "people are embarrass to smile because of their teeth" ad before this 😂😂
Great video, the only thing that was annoying was the out of focus camera throughout :)
This video is great, the zoom @ 2:05  was legend.
Awesome video Kandee! Thank you for the review and your help! Time to get my teeth whitened! Thank You!
Do you also do the bottom teeth too or just the top?
i just got my braces off and want to do this but i have a bonded retainer (wire on the front six teeth of the top and bottom to keep them from shifting back) but since it's on the back of my teeth and doesn't show could i do this? i don't want to damage the retainer and have to get put in again. i would wait til it's off i'm supposed to keep it on for like as long as possible :/
what about your bottom teeth
Is this okay for sensitive teeth?
You look like pink that girl who sings search her
I want to try the method! Looks easy to do it! I have two question: what about the bottom teeth? and hw often do you have to do it to get result? Thank you for sharing!
from someone who has REALLY tried this, does this really work?
you are cute enough to be a professional actress.   Hope this video launches a career.
cool
I subscribed because I'm gonna try this today and know where to come back to comment: "Love it" or "Hells to the NO".
Love the video, camera 🎥 focus was so annoying tho
omg your teeth are brighter than my future.👄👄👄
This is legit the most real, creative, and original diy video I've ever seen. She is literally the only person that takes YouTube seriously as an individual.
she looks like Miley Cyrus
i use Whiting pen and toothpast to get more white teeth
Hi Kendee, not sure if anyone before asked you but how often you whitening your teeth? is it once per week or month? Want to start but not sure how often should I reply it;) thank you so much for reply;D...I'm your biggggg fan from Poland;D ;***
Ive seen this product reviewed a lot and wasnt sure. I saw your video and i believed you instantly ❤
I bass boost
AMAZING!  I am excited to try it.  Don't buy it from Walmart though guys, they are major sweat shop offenders.   Also, Kandee, can you share the lipstick brand you are wearing in this video?  It doesn't look like it's faded at all throughout the video, even though your thumb touched it a few times.  Thanks!
love this stuff!!!
Do you think the other whitening gel from that brand works ? I couldn't find the one with the red label 😭 @kandee Johnson
How are u not verified!
Does it make a difference if you don't use the rinse?
LOVE this product it did wonders to my teeth and the end of the video was touching , SMILE and bring to joy someones day! =D     cheers
Teeth brighter than my future😫😫
Can I just use the guard it comes with? (The kit)
How long does this usually take to work (aka how many times do you have to do it) for your teeth to become white if they are heavily stained?
Such a beautiful smile!!!!!!
What if you are 9 years old and you can't by those things or if you don't have the supplies?
wait but what about the bottom teeth
I really like this method maybe when I get my braces off I can use this easy method
her smile is brighter than my future turr
That is cool
My teeth are eh white not super white but I'll try this out I'll try to buy the stuff tmmr (: thanks !!!
Can you smoke and drink coffee in the meantime (throughout those 14 days), or is that a big no no?
ooooor...... just buy optic white really works tho
Thank you so much.
I have invisalign braces can I use them for that too?
put coconut oil in for 30 mins spit it out and wash you teeth I did it it whitened my teeth
hi
hola
Drinking bleach has been a great help to whiten my teeth. For some strange reason, it gives my mouth an odd burning sensation...
it safe i gus did it. it worked!!!!!1000%
you look great as a blonde ;-) Thanks.
What tooth paste do you use?
Omg how were you so gorgeous at 16 omg 😍 im 16 and I don't even come close
your so cute
my mom boiled my mouth guard once because it was to hard
This is incredible.... I can do this. I was just about to pay $399 to have this done with a local dentist....!!!
When I brush my teeth my gums bleed is that bad
LOL I'm only 12 and I'm already watching teeth whitening videos 😂😂
Does it hurt if you have sensitive teeth? The whitening crest strips hurt my teeth I'm wondering if this might hurt as well?
Omg. She's so sexy why haven't I seen her before
She looks like Miley Cyrus😂😂😂
I love your profile pic
This doesn't work.  Just like every other product I've tried.  If I could add up all the DIY home teeth whitening systems i've bought, I'm sure it would be around 500 bucks, which is what professional dental whitening costs.
Your a beautiful women
I have really yellow teeth for some reason; I've been brushing my teeth daily ever since I was a kid. It seems regularly tinted everyday and my dentist says it's okay because I should have a natural tint but when I'm brushing my teeth I can see that it's sooo yellow... I've tried baking soda+lemon juice and whitening strips on my teeth but I haven't been seeing results!
You do have a beautiful smile
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
how do you make your teeth clean
I have a go fund me page. I have mental health issues and dental issues and don't have the funds. I would REALLY appreciate it if you guys could donate to my severe and serious cause! Please share and God Bless <3  https://www.gofundme.com/i-have-no-dental-insurance
Do you still use this system to whiten your teeth?! I've always seen this in Walmart and wondered if it actually worked because it's so cheap. But you've really got me convinced to try it. Your teeth are SO white!
what about the bottom teeth
what is called
Hey you yea you go to sleep I know your sleepy stop watching random videos and sleep! Good night
I got my braces off a few months ago, but I have a metal retainer on my bottom row of teeth. Could I still do this? Or should I look for something else?
She's beautiful 😍😩
Background music?? any1?
Does she know she had black stuff in her teeth
your hair looks gorgeous blonde!
Can u just use your retainer for this instead of buying the tray?
I squeze some lemon juice on my toothbrush and dip it in baking soda and brush my teeth for a minute or two. And it is not a dramatic change but it does lighten them naturally a few shades for verrryyy cheap!
Just letting people know. This works! 100% i used this before i went on vacation and i got tons of compliments from my family
Do you not drink any coffees or things that could stain your teeth?
Ten DOLLARS lol I luv her I would marrry
Smartt. Thanks!!
Is there any substitute because we dont have that in our country 😭😭
If anyone is wondering if this product works. I used it today, There was a bit of a tingling sensation on my tongue and the gel itself carbonated in the mouth guards, I used two mouth guards one for the top and one for the bottom, I am a heavy coffee drinker most of the times twice a day. And it worked for me literally after one (20 min) use I noticed a difference. the difference isn't anything substantial But there definitely is a difference worth mentioning considering it being only one time and I am skeptical of everything.
1:09 suck and squeeze with your tounge
Just use baking soda you guys. It's more fast and easy
What country are you from
for a beginner do you use this like every week?
i have a problem whenever i brush my teeth it bleeds please answer me
Best video! You are too cute - Thank you :)
this was uploaded on my birthday!
Instead of mouth guards can I use my after braces retainer?
I can't find the Wilson mouth guard for 1$ anywhere someone help
cheapskate
This stuff tastes icky but I can tell the difference after just one use! I went to Wally World and got those mouth guards. BTW anyone who is thinking that they need a guard for the bottom teeth, you don't -  the excess from the top runs all over the bottom anyway and even when you are spitting the bottom teeth get covered too.  Thanks Kandee! I had to go to Walgreens for the single tube of the Plus White. My Walmart said they do not carry it.
Eu tive dentes naturalmente brancos desde que eu tinha quatro anos e nunca mudou. Minha mãe fez algo para toda a nossa família e os nossos dentes foram brancos desde então, mas eu não estou autorizado a dizer o que ela fez
I have super sensitive teeth, will this be really bad for them?
My last name is Wilson
How do you do the bottoms
Does anyone know how long it takes to see a difference???
Does this cause damage to the enamel?
I live in the U.K. So can't get that gel, does anyone have recommendations🤔
What's wrong with your voice? I LOVE your voice! So cute and soothing. You could read the phone book to me and I'd listen. You're awesome!

i do this hahaha, its great
Half my front upper tooth is plastic, is it safe to bleach my teeth then?
I love what you said about the smile and also your video.
Anyone tried this yet?
I keep up with brushing my teeth after every meal but that sometimes makes me think i have a free pass not to brush at night when I get home tired from work. So I eat something sweet like dark chocolate which forces me to go brush my teeth before I go to sleep. ..Either that or my brain is too smart for me and is playing me into eating more chocolate lol
Hey! How do I whiten the bottom? If I just put it on my teeth, my bottom lip is moving it off isn't it?
Turns up exposure
I have just discovered your make-up tip videos and oh my goodness, you are the most adorable and sweetest woman and to top it off, your encouraging!  I am completely smitten by you.   Thank you for your videos!  (I can completely see why you have so many viewers and followers!)  keep it up!  You're doing a fantastic job!
has somebody tried it?
you're stunning. and after seeing is it safe comment i bought it straight away, and i wasnt even planning on buying any teeth whitening product aha.
You're adorable, smart and I love you!!!!! :)))))

Does Plus White pay you to do these facebook videos for them?
I don't like persons with pretty teeth like this because mine are bad.
Ehhhh
Damn...  Those Teeth Are Brighter Than My Future.
I'm assuming this doesn't work if you have braces
It's so nice to see some who genuinely loves a product promote it without being sponsored
what do u do for the bottom?
rip focus
aren't those veneers you're wearing kandee?
YOU. ARE. A LIFESAVER.   I am a coffee drinker.
that's  nice
+Kandee Johnson How about the bottom teeth? Cuz I need my bottom teeth whitened as well.
is it my eyes or is she really blurry
i drink a lot of tea and coffee.. how do you maintain white teeth doing this? i brush morning and night and floss almost daily but my teeth are still off-white.. :/
where is the product name 😢😢
do we put it on the back of the teeth?
do we put it on the back of the teeth?
LOL Today is August 30th 2016 and YOUTUBE just gave me notice that you replied! I hug you and my comment stays as true today as NOV 2013!
How would you whiten your bottom teeth?
Can I do this on my bottom teeth as well?
I am after 'your white' for my teeth, i have the trays which were professionally made by my dentist and cost £300 which is like $450? im guessing? but i cant seem to get the really white teeth i want, which is what you have. Dentist white, like on tv lol why cant i get them white white, they are white but not as white as yours. - WithoutUHere xx
can you eat normal when your doing this, or do you have to eat dry food and stuf. and what if you have fillings? is it safe?
Is this good for sensitive teeth ? I bought the kit and mouth guards but I'm too scared to use them
safe teeth whitening :)  worldwide delievery :)  award winning beauty products :)  work from home job oppurtunity :)   https://m.facebook.com/Aimeesbeautyproducts/
Just bought the whitener. Couldn't find the mouth guards :c The cheapest at Walmart was 14.99. But, I can't wait to try this!  Thank you Kandee! Also, if you have a high gag reflux would this still work with the mouth guard?
I'm legit doing this rn spit is everywhere 😂
Thanks Kandee your the best.
Do you drink coffee or wine? Do you have any issues with that?
what if I want to whiten the bottom of my teeth too? :P
does the mouth guard work for the bottom teeth also?
Thank you Kandee ) I have to try this)!!Ps! Do i need to buy the whole package? The whitening product is easy to buy, but...... can i just buy that & not the mouthrinse? Lovely if you reply). Thanks, and love from Norway... from a Swedish Pernilla  )  )
i love your comments at the end
On a scale of 1 to 10 how much does this method work? I want white teeth so so so bad and I've tried teeth whitening strips and they aren't helping 😔
what about the bottom teeth tho
Kandee I commented here 5 days ago and tweeted you asking about this whitening process. I went to walmart today and bought the kit since they didnt have the gel by itsself and i got the wilson mouth guards. Looks like the wilson mouth guards are only for upper teeth. I bought two mouth pieces but did you just use one for upper and for lower?
Omf your teeth are gorgeous
Umm... Is this safe ? I am not judging Or anything but I watched a LOT of videos about making my teeth to white and in comments they Said It's not safe ... And I didnt see anything like that in this video . I just want to make sure it' is safe . (PLZ answer)
She's so funny :'D
Great video, you are adorable. :)
like you said you have been using this for years since you were young that's why your teeth are so white I've been using this for a couple weeks and it sucks
Now I am in no way a professional, this was just a thought but - to all the people who are nervous about using abrasive teeth whitening products (whether they be homemade or from the store), why not eat spinach 30 minutes before the treatment? I may be wrong but isn't spinach a sort of "sealant" in the way that it gives you a thin film on your teeth? I'm not sure but spinach is definitely good anyways haha
Can I use my clear retainers instead of the mouth guard??
Do you still use this teeth whitening process?
you should learn how to change focus on your camera
Can i just use my braces retainers
+Kandee Johnson  Since u were dental worker can u please make a video how to fix rot teeth without a Dentist plz plz can yu make it now plz 😰😰😰😁
guys, should I choose the youth or adult mouth guard ? i'm 25
https://www.facebook.com/FunkyNailsStudio/
Your so funny and happy! You just got a new subscriber!
anyone in England- do you know where you can buy mouth guards like this, where they're the soft type of plastic? x
What about the bottom teeth?
you're so wonderful!!
do diy fake nails
How long have you used this to get your teeth this white? You mentioned you've been whitening your teeth since 16 but i didnt know how long you've been using this^^ thanks!!!❤️ i will definitely be trying this
my teeth is already white without these but needs more whitening so I used this and it worked thank u very much
Omg!!' My mom met you at fashion week ✨ she is a cosmetologist✨ You made a video saying hi to my sister and I ✨ your sooo pretty 😂
I'm sure that somebody kissed the screen in the first  seconds
WTF is focus?😂
anyone got a link for this product?
Do we need to have the mouth wash after ?! Reply back please
Can i just use my retainer instead of the tray LOL
Is it just me or does she sounds like lolly from orange is the new black lol
The toothpaste she held up can be $100 (Theodent), I think that could be why her teeth are so white too :P
I have permanent retainers, will the product effect it/the glue holding it against my teeth?
How often should this be done?
I got this kit and it says it starts working after 5 minutes and you need to keep it in for 15-20 minutes. Also, the guard it came with got flimsy in the hot water and molded to my teeth.Great video though!!!

Thank god for this video. I've been looking for something to do to whiten my teeth.
Ur camera focus is pissing me off not gonna lie but your videos are good
her voice is annoying
In this vid you really look like Sharon Stone omg!! :D
how did i get from watching scary things to this?
I love my teeth and they're my babies! I'm scared to use anything that will whiten my teeth. My teeth are white somewhat but I'm from Britain and having super white teeth isn't something everyone does.😂😂
Great idea, but you have people that think more is better and they become addicted to it and do it way too often
so if you dont use it for a month but still brush regularly would your teeth become yellow again
I love smiling but I hate my teeth
how do u do the bottom teeth the same way
How long will it take to see a difference?
How to whiten ur teeth: brush them!

Thanks.
+Kandee Johnson Thanks for this very informative video. I don't know if you still post or reply to comments but I was wondering if I could use my retainer instead of a gum shield? or is there a specific reason a gum shield works? If anyone else can answer that would be really appreciated too :)
I am so sorry for your loss
Few layers thick aluminium foil instead of mouth guard?
how do I use it with Invisalign and how about the bottom teeth?
Can it fit on to the bottom
:D
I love you
who could give this vid a thumbs down?  76k up 771 down.  what losers.
Her day-glo-teeth are repulsive.  She is just a walking advert pretending to 'know' somefink.

1:44 your really pretty
whats it called?
Awesome! im gna try this product :)
trying this thank you! love your videos!
How many times do you have to do this, and for how long each time, if your teeth are really stained yellow? I've just done this once for 15 mins and my teeth haven't changed colour at all. However, I don't have the rinse. What is the rinse anyway? I might be able to buy some (or an equivalent) from my local pharmacy. Thanks.
Can kids do this? Is it healthy for kids?
Thanks so much. Really awesome solution.
Sweet!
If you guys are wondering were all that stuff is Go to the tooth brush section for the gel and to the sports area for mouth gaurds
When I was younger, I chipped my two front teeth. I think I will try this and then go to the dentist to get my bonding redone in a lighter shade. Does this sound like a good plan?
is this made in uk
how old is she? she is very beautiful.
its ok Kandee my dad died to
What about your bottom teeth?
I use whitening toothpaste from nu skin & my teeth got visibly whiter in like 2 weeks. I love it & it's pretty cheap. If you want one go to nuskin.com & if you want to get 30% off use sponsor id: US00642099
can you recommend a whitening gel that you can buy in the UK?
do you guys think my teeth going to be whiten right away?
what about the bottom teeth? can you use a gum shield on the bottoms?
Did u get that cup from the Madonna Inn????
Can't believe I've never seen this video before! I thought I had seen every Kandee video!
Sorry about your dad! Continue your great videos and teachings!
Waiting 5 minutes as I type!!! I'm excited
Could I just use my retainers?
this work on veneers?
How to whiten your teeth. Brush them simple 😊
The truck driver didn't smile because you have white teeth he smiled because you are simply beautiful. I would have done the same thing. lol ...Great job thanks for sharing.
ur teeth are beautiful r they perfect im from the uk and we don't have a walmart what is it called so I can order online id b ever sooo grateful xx big hugs xx
the mouth guard is just getting the bottom of my teeth but not the front
Her teeth are as white as SNOW! Also... I. rush my teeth like 3 times a day, wish that would make the teeth white.
Go away you suck
Is there any way to get all the needed things in Germany?
What if you have braces....
Can you use your retainers instead??
Landed Johnson, You Have Nice And Strong Teeth Yourself
Hi Kandee, sorry to say but u got a black thing between your teeth
I'm new to youtube, and to Kandee Johnson, (I know, where have I been???), and I am having sooooo much fun, and loving, watching all the older vids she has on here.  Her techniques are obviously "timeless" and can be used and reused no matter what year you are watching them. And, of course, her beautiful smile and laughter make her "ageless" as well. Loving you, Kandee!!! NEVER CHANGE. XOXOXOXO ;)
wats the name mam?
kandee you are pretty,i want teeth like just yours, can you help me to get a smile makeover?
Can someone out there make my dream came true? All my life dream to have a beautiful and white smile, any celebrity would do anonymity?, giving without knowing for who?
What about the bottom part? :3 it's sooo awesome and cheap, I'm going to try this out, absolutely :3
Any broke bitches out there
I'm going to try this!
what about the bottom row of your teeth
Do you use 2 different mouth guards? One for the top, and one for the bottom?
hey ,if anyone else  is searching for bright white teeth try Ichordo Natural Teeth  Fixer (just google it ) ? Ive heard some interesting things about it and my buddy got cool results with it.
hey ,if anyone else  wants to uncover how can you make your teeth white try Ichordo Natural Teeth  Fixer ( search on google ) ? Ive heard some extraordinary things about it and my mate got excellent results with it.
i really hav to try this
thanks
What if the tooth has filling on top?
Can i use this product and still use coffee? ive been using this product for 3 days and dont wanna risk browning my teeth further.
I have two crowns in the front, I know you said it won't whiten them but will it hurt them? thanks (:
after brushing and flossing, if you bleed, can you still do the teeth whitening process?
You look like ruby rose.
Anyone know how long you have to repeat this procedure for to get pretty recognizable results?
Can I use this method without the mouth guard?
Bought everything for $6.97. Just used it for the first time and can already tell the difference. Amazing! Thank you!
This is a weird question but can I use my retainer? Or would it damage the retainer?
Instead of a microwave just use a kettle
Well done Kandee.  Are you confident that the chemicals in the whitener are safe, non toxic and safe in the long term??  I want to find a system that I wont regret using later in life.  Are the ingredients fully disclosed on the product??  Did you research?  What  would you recommend for the bottoms??
What can you use if you are in Australia?? We don't have Walmart
eurificmf
With that advice you had better add a disclaimer
Would this work on a smoker and coffee lover? Major stainage. :(
Very informative! Thanks Kandee! 👍
This is a pretty cool trick with the football mouthguard, I actually purchased this exact same product and I couldn't keep the tray Plus White came with for more than a minute because I just want to throw up.
Truck driver love =) Smile everyone !
What do you do for the bottom teeth?
didn't work for me. :(
Dayummm You're Amazingly Gorgeous and Have a Beautiful Smile!! Thanks For This Baby Girl
Do you rinse off after ??? And do you brush your teeth before or after?
what's the brand?
Could you use a retainer, or would it just disintegrate it??
You're such a sweetheart! you're so kind too! thank you for the video!!
when you put the mouth guard in the microwave the heat releases  the chemicals in the plastic and a few years down the road you'll have mouth cancer so  you should stop that right away its like putting a plastic water bottle in the sun
interesting points ,if anyone else  is searching for how to whiten your teeth in a week try Ichordo Natural Teeth  Fixer (do a google search ) ? Ive heard some decent things about it and my mate got great success with it.
did you whiten your teeth at the dentist prior to using this product?
Can I just use my retainer?
its a little but blur but its ok👌
I was just at Ulta & the topic of conversation was your videos and how much we enjoy them. You are so sweet, thank you for doing these tutorials😊.
you so amazingly beautiful
what if you aren't american? any english brands anybody knows of that are the same?
Do they sell the product at any other stores?
out of focus
lovee it !! :D
You are BRILLIANT! AWESOME IDEA!
I used it and it actually didn't work for me? I even think that my teeth are more yellow. Am I doing something wrong?
Int no body got time for dat
Tried this, love it. I always put it on when I put my makeup on which usually takes like 3-6 minutes 😋
This might be a studid question but i have a retainer.. can i put the gel on retainer? will it damage my retainer any way?
Your daughter's sooooo cute!
Thumbs up if your watching in 2016
Is there an age limit and if there is then why? And what is it lol ly and ur videos xx
i dont get it..why not just boil the water? why microwave water 😒
do you need to use the rinse ?
What section of Wal-Mart are the mouth guards sold in?  I went to the dental aisle but it wasn't there.
Do I need a guard for the bottom too?
What about the bottom teeth?
Can u use normal toothpaste like Colgate
I just bought the stuff and am so excited to try it out. I'm tired of these off white teeth.
how do you get whiter teeth when you have braces
You're the most bubbly no-nonsense girl I've ever seen, and gorgeous too! Keep going, whatever you have to say, you just make people happy just the way you are ! I know you made my day, even if we don't have walmart in The Netherlands and wouldn't know which product it is or how to get it :)

My braces are coming off in two weeks, and I'm so excited to try this once they're gone!!

You remind me of Tank Girl (she's super awesome!)
I wish someone had shown me this, and with such enthusiasm, years ago! Fantastic video quality, great instructions, and what a fantastic smile! My God, the who's who of Hollywood don't have smiles as beautiful as yours!
It was so hard for me to concentrate on this video ONLY because the background song is my ringtone haha.. gotta love Mozart.
question, after how long will I see results?
My sister used to use the 5-minute teeth whitening stuff! I would always steal it and use it... I had the whitest teeth
Just went and bought all this :)
i love her energy!! such a beautiful person inside and out!!! 😍😍
what about your bottom teeth ?
I use this both part of my teeth (So up and down too?). I need  2 pieces of mouth guard?
instead of melting a mouth guard, can you use a retainer?
so what did you do to the bottom of your teeth
so what did you do to the bottom of your teeth
so what did you do to the bottom of your teeth
pjcp
beautiful smile and beautiful heart
This felt genuine, I'll try this thanks sis.

Your teeth look beautiful kandee
You sound just like lolly from Orange Is the New Black.   (also on Free Willy as the willys trainer.  (can't remember her name)
OMG so many adds!Bots,possibly?
Thanks.  Sorry to hear your loss of your parent may the Almighty bless him with ever lasting peace and tranquillity and RIP AMEEN.  Thanks for your tips on teeth whitening.  ☺
How would you do this to the bottom teeth?
Do you do this every day?
that ad reminded me of glee
Good job
Good job
Wow you are just fab Kandee! Simply love watching your videos. I live in the UK & we have Asda which is part of Walmart. However, I cant seem to find this teeth whitening solution kit or gel & wash here. Please can you suggest anything? Or anyone els please, as I would really like to get whiter teeth without the hefty price professional charge.  :) 👍🏼
Saved this video for when I get my braces off!!!!
What will happen if you do this method with sensitive teeth ???
How fast does this work? someone help? like if I do this will I notice results right away?  also for sensitive  teeth will it hurt or damage enamel?
Hi! About The mouth guard. When It melts Isnt It dsngerous to put It on Your teeth? Could The plástic like react with The teeth? Just asking 😁. I Wanna try This!! Looks good! :)
Hi!
Kandee, Thank you for the great and helpful video !
OMG! This actually works!! At first I was sceptical...like everyone else. Since I live in the UK, I bought it from ebay for a little more than usual. After the first try, my teeth went a bit whiter, now I'm on the second day, and I must say,my teeth are whiter than before!!
what did your teeth look like begore because it looks as if you already had white teeth molars etc
You talk just like the woman who played the trainer in Free Willy Lol
Or...... Just brush your teeth roflll
Saying it's safe doesn't clear up the consequences
Who df does this stuff and my question is does it harm you in the long run...
Everything you explained was perfect, I subscribed.
This is a very intelligent idea!
I used to smoke for 20 years..I wonder if this will help my teeth.
I bet that truck drivers "smile" wasn't as innocent as you think. wtf kandee
what about bottom teeth?
I just started using this today. when I used it in the morning it was fine. It didn't make my teeth that white but it said on the box it'll start getting white after the second week of using the product. But I just used it again the second time and it hurt my tooth. It felt a needle was poking me...will this ruin my teeth and make them sensitive?
hi!I want to know where do you buy that whitening..
She sounds just like that woman on orange is the new black, the shorthair one with glasses
Bought mine on amazon.. Doesnt work :/ so sad..
Don't leave the guards in the steaming water too long, or they will melt into globs of goo - like mine just did. : /
I have been doing this every day for a week and my teeth are so much whiter! I would recommend the youth mouthguards for a more comfortable fit (: Also, I didn't realize this in the video, but the gel is about $5 and it is 2 oz, meaning it will last for a while
great video . thank you.  I would love to know what kind of camera you use ?
This is awesome. I cannot wait to try this!
Nice informal video! what can I use over the counter for a badly stainless bridge? I can't afford to have my temporary bridge replaced and I'm tired of the three Brown coffee stain front teeth
I do this every year for football
I have 2 golds on top on the side will this affect them?
thank you. your the best
what about your bottom teath
Beautiful then and now
sub to me plz my channel  is lean Kerry but when you go on to my channel it is called Leanna s
I Really like your vidéo but I can t get thé gel amozon doesn t ship to Morocco
Can u do this with a real retainer ?
Knew about the mouth guard when my sons played football but wasn't sure about whitener. Yay thank you
Amazing! Thank you so much!!!! <333333
Can't you just brush your teeth and use mouth whitening washing liquid stuff?
Cutest baby girl ever❤️😍
Thanks, Kandee!  I'm adding this vid to my favorites.  Your smile lights up my screen :)  I hope to get mine like that.
2015 anyone??? ;)
Your pretty hot
You, Kandee, are pure happiness and love.
I love you Kandee!
Does anyone know if this is a bad way of whitening for extremely sensitive teeth?
Kandee this was brilliant!!! You are one of the most sincere and helpful Youtubers. I've been watching you since 2009. Love you!
What other store could I buy this because I have no Walmart in nyc ?
your toothpaste costs 100$ wtf
Why don't you use a kettle? Duuhh
Should men use this trick?
Where is that head board from??!
Is this bad for ur teeth? Like does it strip the enamel?
good video. thank you
thank you
Can kids use this stuff too? Can you please reply
..
It really works! I've tried it!!

I like your style, quick and straight to the point!, and what a great smile!. Keep smiling, it looks good on you! Gracias
THANK YOU
Actually it's carol not wayne, we share an iPad ha! :)
GREAT tip and I just love you sweet girl you warmed my heart todsy.
Can someone help me? I've been doing this for a few months now and I just notice this lightens my teeth (I have yellow teeth so I've been leaving it in for 15-20 min and I do it every few days) but it goes back to being my yellow teeth. What am I doing wrong??
thank you sooo much! this is what needed
I LOVE your hair!
Ahh trying the teeth whitening. Excited😬😬😬👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Does anyone have a link to buy this in the UK?
Will it work for gaps??
She kind of remind me of p!nk🙃🙃
Bonus - You can use it for hockey or football once your teeth are white!
That stuff does work pretty good. They even have the brush kind sometimes at the Dollar Tree. Or there is good ole Peroxide on your toothbrush. Super cheap whitening! You have beautiful teeth! I had braces and mine don't even look that good. Love your videos!
Thank u for sharing! You are such a inspiring person.... Love your videos!!! Will definitely try it!!!
Whyyyyy they Sell all good things in America and not in Europe 😩whyyyyy?!
What about the bottom set of teeth Kandee, do you use the same guard as the top?
Do you have any suggestions or tips for people with crowns and such?? I have them, and hate the color of my teeth all I want are pearly whites:-(
youre gorgeous ur hair suits you!
The intro reminded me of Annoying Orange... 🤔
can I reuse the mouth guards?
bought the gel and mouth guards, I have slightly yellow teeth. I'm scared to try it! I give an update later
im 11 years and I don't know if I can use that ?😯 pls answer .
Youre the best.  Thanks.
I LOVE HOW YOU GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT! NO TALKING ABOUT BS JUST STRAIGHT TO THE POINT! THANK YOU!!!!
i wanna buy this but i dont know if this can damage my teeth,i dont wanna miss my teeth lol
I just use the backing soda tooth paste😨😨😨
Soo.. Can you use the mouth guard for your bottom teeth too?
Kandee, I was just watching a halloween special on tv with my kids and you were on there doing makeup for the kiddos! Decided to check out one of your videos, found this one. You seem like such a sweet person. I have been wanting to whiten my teeth forever! Nice video. I will try this!! Thanx!!
this is so smart
half asian baby😍
would that make your teeth more sensitive ????
does it make a difference?!!!
Got black mouth guards:( clear weren't available.
I tried this and seriously didn't do anything 😭😭😭 my friend actually uses this and her teeth are soooo white ugh

Thank you so much! im so excited to try this now!!
I'm trying this right now :D .. I love your videos ! :D
damn you change since 16
yah beautiful smile
Just bought every thing at Walmart, it's was $7.97 and the mouth guards $.97. Pretty cheap! I can't wait to try this out later.
To me, she reminds me of Janelle Monae. Like a white version. Idk if it's her face or something idk lol
WOAH your teeth are so white!. i love it
So... I could just use a retainer?
Girl , you're awesome!
1st comment
you actually look like victoria justice
has anyone tried this? anyone had sensitivity after? thanks!
Why is no one talking about her gorgeous eyes!? I'm so hypnotized by them 😍. Oh wait...bc this day in age you have to have cold blue eyes to be considered "pretty eyes"
Is the mouth guard reusable or should we always use a new one?
thank you sweetie.  God bless you💋💜
can you use.. retainers from the orthodontic that all ready fit you teeth..? xx
That's an amazing trick
wtf she has theodent toothpaste like 100$
i loved your speech about smiling at the end!
Be careful candy .. When u try to boil water in a microwave it will not be actually boild ( scientifically it's not boild) in alot of cases it  explodes u can search about that .. Otherwise I don't recommend trying this at home it's dangerous.. Oh and I Love ur videos keep up the hard work😍❤️👍🏼
Does this work????
we dont have walmart in uk shiit!
I will try if it's work for me! !
Is there anything like this u can get in the UK?
Thanks once again!!!
Any alternative suggestions for these products for us guys in the UK?
great tips!!
Hi Kandee! I assume you do the same for the bottom teeth right?
Nice and simple and direct, will deff try this .
The mouth wash could be of any kind? Great video thanks!!

I'm doing it right now.. So much spit 😂
My gum really hurts from this :(
Thanks for sharing!!!!!

I adore you Kandee! So beautiful and kindhearted. Inspiration too all!! seriously. Much love:')))
christy brinckly
Hot!
Will this product work if I have a bonding wire on my bottom teeth post braces??
Please Kandee dont promote this teeth whitener,i used it for 4 days and it ate through my enamel and started breaking small pieces of my teeth off,even my fillings crumbled.My front tooth enamel is literally gone.I have used professional bleach for 15 years with no problems.So this teeth whitener your promoting is dangerous to teeth.Please warn people.
I liked this video :) I am going to try this :) Thank you for posting this awesome video!
Can kids do this?
Hi! I was wondering i admire your straight teeth :) did you ever wear braces? I have worn braces many years ago, but now i seemed to have a small gap between my front teeth, which i dislike. Is there any way in closing a front gap without having to wear braces all over again? Thank you and i liked this video it was helpful too!
what about your bottom teeth ?
your so pretty
your so pretty
hermosos dientes (Y)
how do you whiten your bottom teeth
wat happens if u use it on a crown
so smart and cheerful! your videos always brighten up my day, much like your smile :D <3
Your method of teeth whitening sounds so amazing! But I have a question, can this harm your teeth? Like, does it scrape of your enamel?
can you use the same mouth guard over and over and over?
1- Can you keep the mouth guard every time you whiten your teeth? 2- Is it bad for you if you swallow it? 3- Does it taste bad?
that focus tho....
so I went to Wal-Mart today and bought this teeth whitening product after you suggested it. bought my mouth guards,  followed every step you have us only I left mine on for 20 minutes. OMG my teeth are so beautiful right now. I am in awe at how effortless and how well this worked. and literally was the cheapest thing ever. thank you Kandee!
You mentioned to just wait till you're out of brasses, does that go the same for Invisalign?
Trying this today here In a little bit so excited and a little nervous lol. I'll post my review in the comments when im done.
What can you do for the bottom teeth
can you put the gel inside the mouth guard instead ?
my teeth are really yellow how many times should I do this a week
Can I do it everyday? Or every other day?
thank you .. so what about the bottom teeth??
Is this ok for sensitive teeth
I was wondering if this will leave white spots!!!??? Help👇👇👇👇
Does this burn e.g when if it gets onto your gums?
Or Colgate....
Just got everything today, can't wait to see it it works!
Free Teeth Whitening Pen- Just pay for Shipping http://goo.gl/N1OJUW
I was looking so forward to this but then near the end when she had mentioned about crowns and such, I just remembered that I broke half of my front tooth in grade 2... haha so much for whitening!! lol
wow! Thank you so much, can't wait to try this once I get my braces removed!!
Sorry for ur loss
this is one of the most interesting clips i have come across
You should of wore red lipstick at the beginning and it would of been like the beginning of rocky horror picture show
DOES SHE EVEN AGE \o/
What about the bottom teeth?
Costs about 11 dollars if you buy two mouth gaurds for both the bottom and top teeth. Currently trying this out!
Beautiful. Keep smilin'
OH OH. OKAY. Kandee, I've been a subscriber for forever now and it just took me till now to realise who you remind me of. Lori Petty. You sound like her and with the blonde hair kind of look like her. Wow.
Hi kadee, which site can I get d whitening tools or where can I buy it in nigeria
What about your bottom row teeth??
That ending was very touching. I smile everyday, and then what you said made me realize even more about it. I almost cried a bit.
Question: do you need to buy two mouth guards for the top AND bottom teeth? Just wondering XD Thx
This method is my holy grail!!! Thank you!
Awesome
Wow that so cool and interesting!
I just discovered you and I love your videos! Thank-you for the last addition about smiling at people and the difference that can make in someone's day.
So I need 2 mouth guards?
You're beautiful and nice white smile. Thanks for the tip
You have beautiful eyes
Can you reuse the mouth piece mire than once?  Also how often and how long would I need to do this?  😊
Awesome, I just tried it last night. Worked like a charm and very cost effective. I've used alot of different products as well, I  am favoring this one for sure. 😄
your hair! 😍😍😍
will it mess up my enamel? i dnt want sensitve teeth!
I used this product but my teeth went wobbling..I started looking goofy maybe due to my gums melted.
What's the actual products you use?
What about the bottom row?
Ok. I'm going to try this. Just have to go buy the stuff...
Do u ever do this to ur bottom teeth?
Just Brought This Product And Plan On Using It Tomorrow.
4:03 :') this was very sweet Kandee <3
cute AF
I've used this several times.  It works very well and very quickly.  I have found that brushing prior to using the whitener causes sensitivity.  But aside from that the product works great!
I love the video, it is much better to follow these instructions. I also love to use Moorack brighter teeth miracle i suggest that you look it up in google. teeth whitening cost is less with Moorack brighter teeth miracle .
Do you have to use a mouth guard?
Her teeth are brighter than my future
What about the bottom
Can i also use the mouth guard on my bottom teeth ? Thanks
We was gonna do it but we don't have a fancy goblet
Is it still in walmart and nice teeth
can you do the same for bottom teeth?
Do you keep both top and bottom mouthguards on at the same time?
You are super beautiful and I also feel a humbleness about you! Thanks for the tip! Will let you know the results.
this is amazing, i bet dentists rip people off all the time
I tried this and my gums got infected. :/
Your videos are so helpful ohmygosh thank you!!!  I've drank tea and coffee pretty much my whole life and my teeth are STAINED really badly. I'm going to go buy these things as soon as I get paid
Can I use my retainers instead of the mouth guards? X
You blonde 👌
Does anyone know where to get the cheap  mouth guard? I tried walmart but no luck.
thanks for this
Wow u hv super pretty white teeth. I shd try. Tks for sharing.
Jesus loves you so much
Kandee do u stay in Texas

Im trying this right now as i type this. I hope it works! Thanks for the tip :)
Nice..i'll try at home Thanks
Do you still stand by this hun, even 2 years on? as I'm about to buy some.

Kandee!!! You are amazing!!!!!!! Ty sooo much for the tips!!!!
What about for the bottom teeth???? Plz help
This product has a rating of 3 on EWG.org, which has a low-moderate toxicity level, which is pretty safe!
Thanks. Im going to try this out..

Kandee you are just so sweet!! God bless! <3
Does this help with people with braces like me?
This is seriously a good brand. It whitens your teeth so much,people think I edit my teeth to be white. Nope,this is my secret. Its so cheap to,seriously people. This is ride or die.
Ugh you are so freakin sweet! I love you! You're such a humble great hearted person !!!
What kind of tooth paste does kandee use?
I've used Plus White and it does absolutely nothing for me. I have flurosis on my teeth but still.
Does this work for weak enamel ?
Maybe you should focus your camera..  😛
I use this as well and works great every time!
Does this legit work? I don't want to damage my teeth!
I love this. Never would of thought
I'm going to try it without the mouth guard.
Kandee... what would you recommend for the bottom teeth? I've been using this for the uppers and its awesome, but my lowers arent white. Thanks!! Love you and your videos!! <3
You wanna know what's beautiful, read the first word again 😍
Your smile is flawless..
Does anyone have a link to the .97 cent mouth guards? I can't seem to find it.
I live and Sydney and we have no walmart... does anyone know what I can replace the product she used with
How do I whiten the bottom teeth?
I just used the plus white system for the first time, but I don't really see a difference. Can someone please tell me how long it took for them to see results? I'm not going to continue using this, if it doesn't work. Seeing as it's not that good for your gums and such.. Thanks in advance!
It have black bewtwin yoir tetth in the beging
Are you still using this teeth whitening system? Before I go buy it want to know if you changed the way you do it. Love love your videos. Thanks
thank you so much for this video, I'm definitely going to try it soon <3
This was so very helpful! Thanks!
Your teeth are brighter than my future.
You are so generous with all your knowledge and I have enjoyed your you tubes so much. I have a 3 yr old granddaughter who loves to watch you with me. She even calls you by name. Thanks especially for your cute sign off of hugs, love, and mantras. You bring your followers joy. Thanks for sharing YOU with us!
Gosh girl, I have just discovered you and you are awsome! I have a great eyelash ideal I have created and trying to get it pattened. I would love to let you see it. You would love. But you are awsome!
If using it for the first time and I have yellow teeth how often do I use it..Everyday? for how long?
I have braces and I'm getting them of in a month. I want to whiten them and I want to try your way. I was wondering if the mouth Guard will work on your bottom teeth. Like if I get two mouth guards will it have the same results on my bottom teeth? Btw love the vid❤️👌🏻
One of my front teeth has a filling in it, which you don't see since it's the same colour of my teeth. Can I use this to whiten them? I'm afraid it's gonna damage the filling and it's gonna fall out ..
Anyone know if you can get this in Ireland 🍀💞
How old do you have to be to use this product? x3
Omg that mouth guard is such a great idea !!! Cuz the blue one doesn't touch every tooth ..lol ..with the other one u showed its so much better !!!! :) xoxox thank
What kind of gel/tube did you use/what's ithe name of the product? I live in the Netherlands so we don't have a wallmart kind of store
awwwww.....she is so cute.
How do you whiten the bottom?
I swear that everyone in my city must've watched this today bc Prime White and the mouth guards were sold out. LOL  Kandee-you're an amazing inspiration.
hey kandee babes does that plus white stuff work on teeth that have been stained as a child from the antibiotic tetracycline. Also if it does work on medicine stains will it affect sensitive teeth or teeth that have some roots exposed. have an awesome day. xx :)
Sorry for your loss beautiful...I send u great hugs and a huge smile from my family to yours 😆
I didn't know you used to bake and decorate cakes!! I wish I could show you some that I've done! You'd love them!
Gg
may be a dumb question, but i have Invisaligns, would they get damaged if i used them instead of the mouth guards?
Your eyes are really pretty 😍
Do we do the same for bottom
She also uses Theodent whitening toothpaste.
What is the name of the whitening kit called
I feel like all of the tooth whitening gel seeps out as soon as put the tray in my mouth. Am I doing something wrong?
Hi, can you tell me please the brand of the products you are using? I cant see them in the video. Or what is the kit name. Thanks.
@dayyo_mbe
I normally don't comment on videos but you showed me your receipt!! Lol so I definitely know that it is less than $10 and I am definitely going to give this a try. Hell, I might go to Walmart right now! :D
The first part scared me jk jk thank u
You are darling!  Thank you for the great tips!
What about the bottom set of teeth?
Today is my second day using this product. But i started to notice that the bottom half of my teeth has white stains and the top is yellow :( i looks really bad. Did this happen to you? If i keep using it will it go away? HELP!
Now can u do the same process for the bottom or is there a different process
THANK YOU!!!! This is just what I need!!
Omg I almost cried at the end
you looked way hoter at 16yo, nice teeth though
free ad blocker  chrome plugin link gmailed to all your subs, no more ads, isn't that great :)
this is why humans are going to end up exinct
Your so cute but did anyone try this and did it work?
AWESOME video!!! Especially the testimony about the smiling truck driver😆😆😆
her camera wont focus
I just found you on YouTube and I literally love your videos!! ❤
Love your voice omg 💖•💖
you are really beautiful
What about your bottom teeth?
OMG where have you been with this since I started drinking coffee years ago!!! Thank you so much.
:( i wish i could go to walmart and get the kit
This video made me subcribe to you :)
you remind me of Shania Twain:)Very cute and femiine.
This works and whitens your teeth however...   It hurts like a ***** afterwards, like seriously painful sensitivity on my teeth. I hate to say but I had to stop using this product after a few times of use.
How do y p u whiten the bottoms?? Is it the same way with another mouth guard ?
Cute mug :)
Thanks for sharing your video with us, I will definitely try this soon!....
Love your video !
That is why you have those beautiful teeth
I did not expect to cry while watching a video for at home tooth whitening! When you started talking about how that truck driver smiled at you after your dad passed away I started blubbering. :)
Kandee Johnson...Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik...nice choice of music!!! :)
Sounds and looks great in the video but is it any harmful to your teeth? Will they become sensitive or will the enamel become weak?
im sooooo trying this
***** Hey, I've used this twice for 20mins each time and my gums are killing! One side of my lip also started swelling up and hasn't gone down yet. Has this happened to you at all?
Anyone else's lip swell up when using this? I've got like a blister
How long does it take for you to start seeing results? I've been doing this for a few days now and I haven't really seen a change.
Who else is here just to cum to this vid thumbs up. Really need it after a hard days work.
What is the product called?
Your camera focus gave my eyes cancer
Thank you!
You are beautiful lol 😍
What if I don't have the mouth guard??
certain tooth whitening brand in korea use this video for their own fb page advertising.. is this happening under your permission?
Will this intensify the sensitivity of your teeth? I already have pretty sensitive teeth and am always apprehensive to do a whitening system. I just really want to have extra white teeth for my first prom in about a month. Please answer asap. Thanks kandee!! Love your videos.
Well fuck I live in another country, gimme access to all these products!!!😭😭😭
You're gorgeous inside and out, keep smiling and thanks for sharing :-)  I'm going to try this.
Im literally in LOVE with your name!
Quick qestion; can you buy two mouth guards, one for the top and on for the bottom? Or does the mouth guard only work for the top? Thanks :)
Can't wait to try this! I smoke and drink wine,  my teeth are barely off white but I cat afford high end products or the whitening at the dentist. Thank you so much for this and all your videos!
Ok this was GREAT
What if we don't use the rinse?? Any alternatives? Is it really necessary?
what if there is no  gel that you buy what alternative we can used
And every video doesn't say if it's for kids,or not
Is this for kids? I'm 9 years old and my teeth is yellow and I don't have a lot of money please make a video for whitening teeth for kids please?!
I will try it hope it works
look at the back of the pack it tells how to do it
you boil it not microwave
i went to all walmarts near me but couldnt find it.. i think its only available in the united states?
How much is the gel? Help?
Awesome
YES PEOPLE THIS REALLY WORKS!  KANDEE IS THE TRUTH!!!!!!
You do know how horrible Walmart is....right?
Hey kandee I have a question. I have very thin teeth with little enamel and was wondering if this whitening gel is safe? Thanks.
This was very generous for you to share. I wish to try this soon, thank you
Is the Natural White 5 Minute Whitening System as effective as the Plus White 5 Minute Whitening System?
I wish I had all dark black teeth.
That kid at the end is so cute!
Kandee, thank you so much for your tips. Off to try this tomorrow...also, your personality and sweetness are very refreshing in this time!  Bless you..
Thank you much, that was we done. Can I ask you what type of camera you are using ?
That product is probably full of chemicals, and probably capable of causing diseases like cancer.
Her face kind of looks like victoria justice
Can i just put the gel in the tray before putting it in my mouth?
Ahhhh thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!
Can I hope for results when I have a smoke in one hand and a mug of coffee in the other watching this video?
Beautiful. . .
How many treatments can you squeeze out of 1 tube of gel?
chipy chips.
Thanks for the tip Kandee!  I stumbled upon this tonight for $5 at Dollar General!  I was like, "Hey!  This is what Kandee uses!"  :)  ((HUGS))
?
You can also get crest whitening strip
I couldn't find any mouth trays at my Walmart, Where else cold I find it?
Hey Kandee I love your videos!! But I'm from Greece and I don't know where to find these :-/  Anyway,your smile is awesome!
Do u know how to make the solution at home?
Can we just reuse the mouth guards??
she got natural white teeth therefore talking lots
i almost fell in love. but then the kids came ... oh well. thnx for the tip.
What about the bottom teeth?
What about the bottom row... Football mouthguards don't really form to your bottom teeth...
Great idea, thanks for sharing!
Life savor thanks! !!
Instead of making a teeth tray, could i use retainers from where i've had braces?
i go to boxing, the fucking mouth guard, it's more for boxing.. why do they name it football mouth guard this isn't hockey,rugby,boxing
Excellent tutorial. Subscribed :)
you're so honest and sweet, i love the video so informative <3 Thank you
Get that money 😎 girl. $$$$ 😘💋
Can someone please tell me if this will ruin my enamel and make my teeth sensitive! And also did she mention in the video how often you are to do this? I thought she said only once a month but I think i'm mistaken. Does anyone know?
Wow! THANKS so much! Seriously I bought that kit and the mouth tray was so bad that I couldn't even use it, so I stopped. Then I over spent on a brush and gel kit from Colgate, ad that was an annoying system, so I stopped. But I have a huge issue with my teeth! Thanks so much for this tip. :)
I bought this stuff today, let's see if this works.
Great demo, I'm going to get the toothpaste after I finish up the Dr. Song Teeth Whitening Kit I just got & use tha mouth piece it comes with!
it was so blurry i could barely watch it
Wow great video!  Pretty straight forward and simple!  I loved it!
can you buy it online?
Hi it was great idea  but I cant see a name of this products. Thx have a nice day;)
If this was any other person,  I would be totally disgusted by this video,  but since it's Kandee, I'm glad about this
umm do they still sell it?
Honestly best teeth whitening video I have seen I get my braces off in May and I can't wait to try this!
does the retainer stay and work so it can whiten?
Kandee, I had a question. Do you use a different mouth guard every time you use the whitener or do you use the same one?
I use my football mouth piece at the end of each year to the next
Is this for kids?
Hey, you have nice teeth. Can you will them to me in case you don't need em anymore? Would ya do that for me?
How many day's does it take to see results?
Will any mouth gaurd work
What happens if u have really crooked teeth but can't get braces
What do you do about the bottom row?
you are such a great human being. sorry about your dad. i just started watching your vids
Brush your teeth
Is this how MMA fighters whiten their teeth?
omg that's is shiny white
feminist bitch
FOCUS YOUR CAMERA PLS
can you tell me please the brand name of the mouth guard ? I like how you can shape it as ur teeth. I used to use the blue one which comes with it, which I hate it .
Yeah this stuff really does work I bought it because your teeth are amazing and white so thought I would give it a try :). I didnt stick to the twice a day regime cus I was alittle lazy haha but did do it once a day for two weeks. When I applied it, left it on for 5 mins and took out the tray I could already see my teeth sparkle like literally lols not quite white but it sparkled, so it does work, but of course over time it got whiter :). I had to get it on amazon as we dont sell that here in Aus :(. Love the rinse of it too, mouth feels fresh as after lols. Thank you for sharing this quick, easy and guaranteed to work product Kandee, you're awesome and gorgeous! :) xxoxoxx
I love you, Girl!
I really want to try this but my bottom teeth aren't straight? Would I be able to still do this or wait?
Do the trays work for bottom teeth? Or are they only made to mold to the top teeth?
Great tricks. Also you are a natural! In front if the camera that is. Quick, informative, comprehensive, and friendly I'm sold. Lol. Thx.
Kandee Johnson this stuff really DOES WORK!! I have been using this for about a year now and I get really great results!! Now I use the Crest 3 D Whitening Toothpaste and this but I wait about an hour or 2 after brushing my teeth with that toothpaste cause it can cause some burning if used right afterwards!! I brush my teeth right after I eat dinner then don't eat or drink anything afterwards and  before or after using the Plus White to get the best results! IT WORKS!!!
Awesome! I really do love that whitening gel works just as good as the dentist gel and I paid $200 for that one. I just never liked the mouth tray that came with it. But awesome trick with the mouth guard! Thank you!
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 podias subir los videos subtitulado te seguimos desde españa! jajaja😉😆
Can u just u whitening toothpaste?
very enlightening (and en-whitening)
Like my mother, My teeth have always had a yellow stain. I've brushed like crazy and flossed and used everything natural to make them lighter! Nothing worked 😞 but I watched your video and decided to try it and it's amazing!!!!! I've done it twice now and my teeth are already so much whiter! My pictures look so much better! Thanks!!!
What a wonderful story about the truck driver!❤️
What about the bottom teeth? 😁
I not really sure about the standard being five minutes. From what I hear it takes fifteen for carmbite gel to break down into hydrogen. Five minutes is not long enough for carmbite peroxide to break down.
I thought you were a natural blonde. You pull the blond look quite well. Girl your teeth are so white. They are not just white they are bright white I give anything to have my teeth look like that. I mean wow wow wow   By the way do you drink coffee or red white?
Could I put the serum in my retainer?
What about the bottom teeth?
how long does it take for yellow teeth to become white with this?
thank you but...... I have braces !
I'll definitely have to do this when I get my braces removed XD
Is it good for braces
What if you have cavities?
You are so awesome. Very intelligent way of whitenning I'd never think that way of doing it. And that final message, is so true, those words were beautiful , I'll smile more cause is true, a good act can make people's day.  Happyness can cure any heart.
How would you do the bottom ones
Most perfect smile I've ever seen! Love your videos!
What do you do if you don't have the mouth wash
Has this actually worked for anyone? It sounds too good to be true honestly
does this tooth whitening ruin the enamel on your teeth?
A truck driver? Kind of creepy
How mutch did you get for this commercial?
you Kandee are one adorable character, and that little kitten at the end of the video is a projection of your beauty and cuteness ! you should have your tv show !
haha OMG kandee i've never see such a beauty guru like you! loveyou <3
Where I get it ???
thank you so much for this i cant wait to try it
you are so cute omg
I live in the UK and cant get these products...:(
People be careful about the guard and forming it 2 your teeth.... From personal Experience, A Dr. Once Bought Me A Guard that you put into hot water 2 shape 2 your teeth (because I grind my teeth at night) Anyway, when I pulled out the guard, a piece of my tooth came out with it, and Nobody wants that!!  So, i'm jus say'n... be Really careful! I would hate 2 see anyone go through this, its Not fun. This is Not an attack on Kandee! I Luv Kandee, I think she is great and a great inspiration 2 others! much luv xoxo
OMG , you really look like Heidi Klum..
What about the bottom teeth?
How can you do the bottom?
I have permanent retainers, can i still use this method ?
sorry to hear about your father
????
Hey , erm great tortorial it really worked for me thanks and btw I just wanted to know as u post stuff on youtube  how do u post tortorials and get money for it . Coz Im saving up for my own laptop and I thought I could makensome tortorials  and use the money for my laptop :) Xxx

Awesome awesome awesome!!! Thank you for this tutorial! Your smile is gorgeous, such pearly whites. :-) Looking forward to having super white teeth like yours. ;)
What about bottom teeth?
You seem like a lovely person. Really love your videos! You are extremely talented!
How do you whiten your bottom teeth??
This is awesome! You are awesome! You inspire me!
omg i love your energy <3
What lipstick are you wearing??
so pretty face and teeth lovely
Thanks for the tips your teeth look great.  Lala
Thinks for the tips.  Lala
I cannot believe that this actually worked.  It molded my teeth like my $200 tray.  Thanks so much for this info!
But that doesn't hurt or kind of destroyes your enamel ?  I heard that the whitening destroys the enamel ... sooo ?
Is this not bad for the teeth tho?
Is this good for a substitute for invisalign too??
wow,  i came for teeth whitening advice and end with an amazing message. my son has cancer, thanks for the pick me up..
Thank you for this video! I've been looking for a cheaper way...bought the stuff twenty minutes ago, trying it out tonight.
Looked at this and thought 'OMG i must do this'...went onto amazon (I live in the UK) and the kit is around £15 and the mouthgaurd is £85!!!!!!! Anyone know where I can find the stuff cheaper?! :(
I might use the mouth piece to see if it'll straighten my teeth xD
I have my top front tooth bonded, will this come off when i use the mouth guard? I hope not, wanted to ask first before trying this, thanks so much I love your video's..and your beauty, personality .etc....I love it ...
What about the bottom teeth?
Does anyone really know where this product is made.... ?
Omg I used this and got some on my gums  and now its like it ate  a peace  of it dont use this
Omg I used this and got some on my gums  and now its like it ate  a peace  of it dont use this
Because I'm a person that learn video production ... I can't bring myself to not say this ... The focus of your video is all wrong ... can't see a single thing u were showing ... but nonetheless it was a cool video ! Shall try and see if I can get them here in my local stores ...
I have that thing, but I got my braces now( aaaa!!!!
Can you tell me what color lipstick you are wearing, and lipliner if you are using it..thanks!
This thing have selling to malaysia or not ? *sorry my bad english
you are so cute!! love your energy <3
Could you be ANY SWEETER??????!!!!!! <3 <3 <3
Your post must have made the price of the mouth guards skyrocket!! Shopped around and couldn't find the Wilson mouth guards for cheaper than $5.99 (and obviously need 2 for bottom and top). Thanks for the video though. Can't wait to try it! Liked what you said about your dad!
im tryna whiten my teeth to be like thad castle and i thought id just say that you're cute as fuck
I use to have one of those  cuz I would bring my teeth in my slepp
u are awesome, I always watching ur vid 👍
I started using this product about a month ago but it only leaves a temporary whitening for maybe about a few hours for that specific day that I use it. I don't know why.
She's pretty
can you use this with permanent retainers
BUT HOW ABOUT IF I DONT HAVE A MOUTH GUARD? Do I just keep my mouth open or can I close my mouth?
Should I use my retainers? (that are like mouth guard)
Can you use a black mouth guard?
Do you do the same to the bottom teeth?
it dosent work
HAHAHA you are so sweet! Thank you very much! I hope you get as much good as you are sharing and more. Have a sick one.
Super CUTE lip stick, Kandee !! What is it?  Thanks and love you to bits!!!
I'm in the UK so would I still be able to get the whitening kit?
where did you get that awesome goblet?! ive been looking for one(or more) everywhere
Omg you have the most beautiful teeth I have ever seen!
How long did it take you to have your teeth that white. I dont expect mine to be the same but I have been using it like it said on the box twice a day for 2 weeks and I have no really seen any difference at all. I have even left it on for longer and nothing.
I think I'm just going to get the tube of the whitening gel, but if I just get the tube what do I rinse with? water? Mouthwash?
I think I'm just going to get the tube of the whitening gel, but if I just get the tube what do I rinse with? water? Mouthwash?
Your teeth are super white mines yellow how long would it take to get my teeth like yourd
Is this safe for fillings??
I have the same stuff and I barely use it. Now looking at your teeth, now I really want to use it :)
That made my teeth yellower ;(
How do you whiten your bottom teeth?
how can i buy this package in iran
Very helful dear thank u very Much
What was that whitening product called??
Don't they make moldable teeth trays u can buy?? I've seen them at the strore.
How long does it take to see results? My teeth are really yellow and I've been using this product for a week but I don't see a difference.
this is so cheap im wondering if it actually works or if you just have naturally white teeth because you take care of them brushing after food and teas etc :(...maybe you can find a friend with yellow teeth and try this lol so that i can see if it actually does work because your teeth were already white so i cant see a difference :(
thanks kandee! this is so helpful for someone young like me and on a budget
;-) ;-)
:-\
Thanks I'll try that :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)
Do you reuse the mouth guard over and over again?
the teeth perfect already you don"t even need it.
Hey.. Umm can i use your teqnique with the blue mouth tray?
Can't wait to get my braces off to do this!
Definitely trying this!
Thank you for the beautiful reminder at the end ♥
Plus White  The manufacturer has recalled this product
What kind of toothpaste is that, that she uses?? I can only see part of it but Ive never seen anything like it!
Wow Kandee, you were HOT when you were 16😵 And you're gorgeous now!
what section in walmart do they sell the tooth guard?
when will you see the results?
lip colour pleasee? 😍
your teeth are blinding me :X
the end made me water eyes lmfao ;(
Can you put the directly into the tray??
Do you do it everyday or every other day
It took forever to mold it to my teeth lol. But I made it through the 20 minutes, I didn't see a huge difference but it isn't supposed to work within' just one use right? :) did you use it twice a day the first time you started using it? ☺️
HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (sorry for the !'s)   ;)
Can you reuse the same mouth guard or throw it out after?
What about your bottom teeth? I love your hair it is amazing I have always had short or shortish hair and love it.:P
What if my teeth are already sensitive can i still do this teeth whiting
can I re-shape the same tray for my bottom teeth?
Just a warning guys. My enamel started going away from using this :l
So you've been whitening since you were 16 huh... no wonder.
drop dead gorgeous
your pretty
Love you for the money savings tips!!!
@Rachael Pons the plus white kit on the back it has warnings and it says, "stop use and consult your dentist if you experience any serious burning sensations, sensitivity to gums, mouth, or tissue  damage." ( i have it with me rn) oh and sorry if im answering your question late :/ i just got the kit. Anyways, hope this helps :)))))))
I need really wite teeth
How many times can you use the same mouth guard, or can you only use it once?! Pleeeeaaasse answer!!!!!!!
Is it permanent?
wow her daughter is so cute
Aw my dad passed away too. A day after this video was posted actually. This year will be five years.
Love the story at the end. I remember when my hubby and I separated for a while, I was alone with three kids at the grocery store which if u have toddlers , u know is a challenge in itself ....anyway I was brave and didn't cry but someone's kindness and smile was what brought tears to my eyes ;)
Is there any other store I could get these items at?
Wow
Can you do this of you had barces and have a little piece of steel behind your front teeth?
Kandee will it whiten my teeth I had to take tetracycline as a child and it has stained my teeth bad I have tried everything .
Do you re-use the trays or buy new ones every time?
Love ya
Omggggg she was talking about me I have braces.      And kandee you are my inspiration
Thanks so much for the whitening tip.  Looks like a great way to brighten your teeth for an inexpensive amount.  Your teeth are beautiful too!  God bless!
You have really nice eyes
How do u do ur bottom teeth?
I wonder how does this compete to Easy whitening's 30% gel.  Plus white 5 is like 0.1%.
That 5 minute whitening crap burned the shit out of my teeth did anybody else have that problem? I had to stop using it, it hurt pretty bad.
What about the bottom set of teeth ?
How do I whiten my bottom row of teeth?
I LOVE to do the coconut oil trick even though it has a nasty feeling when you are swishing it for 20 mins but makes your teeth white and improves a lot of other stuff in your body like better digestion system, better eye sight and more! :D
How old are you?
THAT TRUCK DRIVER WAS PROBABLY THINKING DIRTY
I tried finding the mouth guard but couldn't, which area in Walmart is it in?
I melted it :(
Kandee Johnson uses Theodent chocolate toothpaste which is $60, not bad if it does the job.
What toothpaste does she use?
Going to try it next month hopefully if my mom can afford it I'll ask and see if I can get it as a early birthday present cuz' my b-day is next month on the 21 and I've been wanting to whiten my teeth for a long time now.
If you just buy the tube of gel (that's what I did) does it work better to use just the gel or should i use some sort of rinser too ?
Does it really work?
New subscriber
Going to try and find these products on Friday and give it a go!
I have a question how long does it take to get your teeth white is you only have light yellowness on your teeth. ( like how many days)
Thank you I'll try it :-) ;-)
Then end was so adorable :3
You look like Kim Catral.
O m g
Does it make your teeth feel super sensitive
It rips your enamel off right? Do you have a trick to whiten without taking off your enamel?
Hey everyone! I wanted to let you all know you can have a beautiful smile just like Kandee. Follow me on twitter to be entered in my giveaway of the Smile Brilliant Custom Tray kits. Its a $130 value all you have to do is follow me and ill add you to the giveaway! :)@Starla_Graham
will this not work if you have some what crooked teeth?
How much does the teeth whitner cost?
Anyone knows whats that lipcolor on Kandees beautyfull mouth?
I couldn't find the mouth guards at Walmart so I'm gonna use the one that comes in the box so hopefully it'll work too :) thanks for you! I just bought this product today!
What about your lower teeth?
You seriously have such a bubbly joyous way about you! :D I've subscribed to your channel just because of how smiley you just made me feel about brushing my teeth! LOL!  Keep up the good work! :D :D :D
Doing it now as i type this message thank you for this video bought it at walmart for 7.00
Ugh i got braces and a nother year wow il be doaing some waiting ha ha ha
Can I still use this system if I have cavities filled in?
just some friendly advice: you do the SAME thing for your BOTTOM teeth! you'll need to make another tray to mold it to your teeth. hope that clears up any confusion =)
Can i use this as a retainer?
thank you it very useful info
Do you whiten your bottom teeth?
Omg my uncle brought me that same chocolate toothpaste I'm scared to use it tho!
Kandee does it matter how old you are? because im 10 and i wanted to ask you before i try to be on the safe side!
"How to whiten your teeth" brush your teeth
Love you ! this video is so helpfull:)♥
Wow, appreciate your upbeat personality! People complain that tooth whitening doesn't work, but I think the trick is to put it directly onto your teeth and then use the tray to catch drips. It seems most people are putting the gel into the trays and then 1) it oozes over and 2) it may not be getting into all the crevices. Thanks for your video!
This video is fantastic!!! But can you write the name of the prodocts you used please? :)
I want these product... How can I ordered these product from Japan? :)
Is that you daughter or niece of sibling cause all I can see is ADORABLE!!!!!🙉🙈
How do i whiten the bottom row of my teeth ?
love you so much Kandee! Xo
What about the bottom teeth? Should you buy a second mouthguard?
Kandee, just a suggestion for your fans with braces.  My sister's best friend told me to use Toprol smokers tooth polish on my teeth with my braces (yes, I was totally 1980's gurl).  When my Father took me to my next orthodontist appointment. The Doc asked my Father for a private counsel. He told both of us with a huge smile. I have never seen a teenager's teeth look so bright, gleaming, and SHINEY!!!  Of course, my Father  and his big dimpled smile strutted on out of that office with his natural swagga!  LOL! I am totally going to the store tonight to buy the products and use your method! Thanks for the great tips! Big Hugs!
GREAT tutorial, thank you!  One question tho:  Can I use this every day at first, and if so, for how long should I leave the trays in?
cool
What about for the bottom teeth??
Love this and it really works well!!!! Hugs, Kaye 😀
WOW! I want that thanks very helpful :>
Wow girl, you're are such a happy person! You seem to see that a lot - sending love <3
u just got yourself a new subscriber.. thanks :)
Did she played a role in The Carrie Diaries ? I think her name was Samantha
is it truth that some teeth cant get really really white no matter how many times you whiten it?
What about your bottom teeth?
YOU. ARE. A. GENIUS!
How old do you have to be to do this
thank you for telling me about the brases. they are not fun.

Hey Kandee I have an emergency private question can you pls srnd me a msg. Idk how to msg you but pleaseeeee.
I don't think its a good idea to melt the plastic and than put it in your mouth. Personally I'd be worried about stuff like BPA and other bad stuff found in plastic that they havnt discovered yet.
Your teeth are really white
You sound like twilight from my little pony
Is this stuff safe i.e. FDA approved or something?
What about the bottom teeth?
I loveeee you & your videos.
Is it ok if I use a colored mouth guard at my walmart all they sell is red black and yellow
I have crooked teeth would this still work for me?
isnt it bugging anyone else that 90% of the video, she's blurred? wud have helped if she had focused the camera
Oh my God Kandee you're so great. I always wanted to do something for my teethes to make them whiter but I was afraid to use something. Thank you for your tips and keep it like this you're a miracle :*
Where did u get you're bed ? Plz. I want it
What about the bottom roll?

What about the bottom teeth? Do you need to use another mouth guard?
Omw 2 walmart baby....thk u

Thanks for the tip. I like your videos.

How long does tht tube last you??  :D thx, great great tips
hey kandee would this do any damage to ur enamel?
How do we do our bottom teeth?
I love you so much!
awesome video!!! thanks!!
Is there a British equivalent to that whitening kit?
U gotta leave it in for 10 minutes. It STARTS at 5 minutes. It says it right on the tube!!!
I love you!!!!
Sweet lady, thanks!!!
You are so pretty and i love love love ur teeth
Llllloooooovvvvvveeeeeee it omg it wprks amazingly !!!! :)

THANKS FOR THIS!!
Was thinking about Zoom buy im trying this 😉
thank you, very nice tip from I'm sure great person with a beautiful smile :)
WOW!!!!!  THANKS FOR THIS!!! KUDOS AND TWO THUMBS UP!!!!
Do you whiten the top And bottom separately? Or use both trays at the same time
Hi Kandee, thank you so much for this video! Can you tell me what color lipstick and eyshadow you are wearing in this video?
Lol fancy goblet!
Her CEO makes $9000 an hour, and you pay his wage.  She has an underground bunker with helicopter and all the bells and whistles.  She takes from the poor and gives to herself.
You shouldn't buy anything fromWalmart.  The owner, old mrs Walton pays workers in Bangladesh, China, etc from 13 to 17 cents an hour and treats them like slaves.
Thank you so much for this.  I have been looking for a cheap effective way to brighten.
The back of the tube actually says that it takes 5 minutes for the whitening gel to activate so technically you should leave it in for 5 min + 5-10 min for the actual whitening to happen.
The under teeth! How do you whitening those?
Kandee, I actually love you right now. Last year I spent over 100 pounds on a retainer, and you've just shown me how to make my own.
Awesome video you got a new subscriber :3 I like you're hair by the way :)
I got retainers after i got my braces offand inwear them every night, could i use those instead of the guards, i mean obviously ill clean them after, but could i? Better fit of my teeth anyway
Just got my braces off today (six years of it!) and immediately bought this right afterwards and used it and I can already tell it whitened my teeth. I can't wait to see how white my teeth will look after the two weeks :) I have naturally yellow teeth as well.
Ur energy is aweso
Cool and ur teeth are sooo white
i love your smileeeee im waiting to my braces be removed to have a smile like you1!
Fantastic video....love your teeth whitening method which is all yours. Brilliant. Thanks for sharing Kandee
I tried this product and put it in my mouth for 20 minutes and it DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. It's crap. Rembrandt toothpaste does a much better job, though the abrasives might not be good for you teeth.
KANDEE! I have been trying to whiten my teeth FOREVER and, while effective (for a while) it's so expensive. I'm a huge fan of yours and found this video about a week ago, went out and bought mouth guards and the whitening system and already see a HUGE difference! Just wanted to say thanks so much!
kandee this was the most elaborate teeth whitening video i've seen on youtube. good job! its great hearing this stuff from someone who worked in this industry.  what are your thoughts on toothpaste with novamin >> calcium sodium phosphosilicate? it is supposed to strengthen and repair the teeth, is this legit?  do you think it would be good to floss, brush with regular paste before the whitening session and also brush with novamin paste after the session?  would it make sense that the enamel will be more exposed after the whitening procedure so that the active engredient of the novamin toothpaste (sensodyne or other brands) will be in better position to repair the enamel/tooth?  it would be great if a dentist or someone from the dentist industry can shed light on this question in case kandee doesn't reads the message :) thanks! mile
Is this ok for younger teens?
hi Kandee , after watching video, went out and purchased kit and mouthguard.. i was just wondering if you know whether the mouthguard releases a good dose of BPA into ya when you heat it up like that and then put it into your mouth...??????.... ive no clue but since you were a ortho assistant in a previous time... do you know ? :)  thanks for video .. saved me $$
Has anyone with cavities tried this? It says on the box not to use with cavities,  but I'm wondering how much damage it does.
You copied strait off of someone else on YouTube they made theirs in august.
" saving you dollars and making you look good!"
thanks
Where can I buy these products as I cant find it in Norway ? ;)
What about the bottom? Same thing?
Thank you very much.
Why can't I try it with braces?
Can we use the mouth guard more than once?  And for our bottom teeth we get a separate one and do the same thing?  By the way I really like this video (:
How often can this routine be done?
Aww Kandee, you are so sweet <3
You are the sweetest! I smile to strangers a lot too..8)) my eyes watered at the end 8')
You were so pretty when you were 16
How do you whiten the bottom ?
Hello sweetie I live ur videos ur awesome.  Thank u for all ur tipsy also I have a question.  Do I need to buy another mouth guard to whiten my bottom teeth??
Hello sweetie I live ur videos ur awesome.  Thank u for all ur tipsy also I have a question.  Do I need to buy another mouth guard to whiten my bottom teeth??
U could put the gel inside the guard, thts wht I do! :)
Hey, I love your video. Just wondering if you know of any UK products that work similar to this one? Thanks.
Ho Kandee,  I have been using it for 14 days in a row now but I still don't quite get the result I wanted, so my question is how long do I have to wait to start doing the 14 days routine again? Thank you
I'm what about the bottom
How do you whiten the bottom teeth?
Love it! Thank you. I am going to have my daughter do this today.
I have sensitive teeth so not sure I can do this.
I love your videos! Thanks for this! You are great! I love your spirit!
You should try Manic Panic colors. They are amazing! :)
You're awesome! Thank you!
But the whitening tray is only for the upper teeth only?
What beauty school did you go to? o:
What an awesome tip
I wish I had beautiful teeth like you!!!!! 🙍
I'm a waitress & I also clean houses 🙋
I have sensitive teeth and I would like to whiten my teeth. Is there a way to keep your enamel healthy and whiten your teeth for sensitive teeth?
To me as a european (dutch) girl this is not clear at all because your explanation of what product you you for the whitening itself goes so fast! I dont get that part.
I love this video I will try it soon thanks
Can Kandee what if I have naturally yellowish teeth but they are not that yellow. I guess I got them by not drinking enough milk when my teeth were growing.
http://www.kandeej.com/2010/03/love-you-like-big-baby-cheeks.html?m=1

Ur flawless kandee
I love you, Kandee. Never stop smiling. 💕
Goblet lol :)
hi divas!!! I started a beauty channel. please check it out and let me know what you think!! :) iraStyles thank you for your time!!!:))
Love this!!!  I always buy the $50.00 pro ones.
can i use my retainer to act as the mouth guard? Or would that damage my retainer
Love the video: simple and easy to understand
can I use my plastic retainers?
How about the bottom teeth ?
Could you boil water over the stove as well?
What about the bottem kandee?? Ps love you and i have been watching you since 2009, lol i find it weird because im only 13!!!
the best way to brighten your smile, is aluminum FREE baking soda, this does a few things you need to know. this kills bad breath germs, it also kills germs that cause heart disease. baking soda is a mineral something we get from God's love please try it and share with everyone. God Bless.
What about the bottom?
what can use for the bottom teeth..
Do we do the same process for the bottom teeth ?
This is the system I use and it works! It burns a little because I have super sensitive teeth but the burn equals more cleaning power if you ask me!
which mouth gaurd did you get? i found the brand but did you get the youth one or the adult? and what one do you use on the bottom??? D=
you are so cute! i hope this works! if it doesn't, you're still awesome!
I get the comment about your voice lol I watched your first videos and you have a normal voice and later on you start talking with this high-pitched girly baby voice --- like the Kartrashians --- but I ain't made at ya ;)
Omg I need to try this!!! Thank you for enlightening me!
is this safe for teens?
I love your voice!
LOVE. Thank you so much!
Do you do the same for the bottom??? I actually am gonna use it soon and was wondering
I wish I knew this before throwing down 25 dollars for crest white strips D: i hate wearing them 14 days and i hate wearing them for 30 minutes can't stand how much it makes me spit…. this is awesome!
I'll be trying this for sure! The only thing I'm wondering about is my bottom teeth. Do you do the same exact process for the bottom too??
Omg what lipstick are you wearing? Perfect nude eve!!!
I tried this its AMAZING!!!!!!!!
Are you suppose to use the same mouth guard every time?
i love you mug where u get it
thank you ! I have started it :) love you !
How do you whiten the BOTTOM teeth????
This is an amazing idea!! I'm so thrilled to go try this! Also, thank you for providing videos I can watch with my little ones around. The three year old picks up EVERYTHING I say or so or watch and it's nice to have a safe outlet to entertain myself while they're watching TV or playing together. :)
how about below teeth?
What products can i use in germany?
And do you do the same for the bottom teeth?
Thanks so much this is very helpful!! But what about the botton teeths?
Do you do the same thing for the bottom teeth?
If we have retainers can we justs put it in them?
I'm compelled to comment because I just paid a lotta money at the dentist.  Ouch. I tried to mold one I got from Walgreens and it didn't work. If I ever need trays, and this works, I will be in heaven.
thanks very much!! just what im looking for...
In what section would the mouth guards be in? Just the regular sports area?
This is so awesome.. I would love whiter teeth. It's very affordable now..thank you....!
Do you buy a new mouth gaurd everytime?
HI Kadee...i just watch your vid..its looks/souds unbelievable...wow..if this really works ..people pay wayyyy to much all these years...i dont live in the us...but iam giong to aks my friend whos lives there to buy it for me...can u please tell me what brand the mouth guard is?? thanks soo muchXX
Could you do it for the bottom teeth as well?
I have always been wanting to whiten my teeth at cheap cost. I might try this!  @Kandee Johnson  You forgot to mention some things in your video!  After the 5 to 15 mins depending on your teeth do you recommend using the mouth wash that came with the gel or can you use any mouth wash maybe just even water to rinse off the gel?  What does the mouth wash product help with on the teeth?
I just did this and it works really well! Thanks!
What lipstick are you wearing in this video?!
I'm going to try this now I have the gel and the tray:) I'll comment back in the next few days to let you know how it goes!!!!:))))
What mouth guards are you guys using? The ones she showed in this video aren't available anymore
I love this makeup look
My braces came off yesterday!!!! So I'm definitely trying this
Helpful love it even though I'm to young to get that I'll ask
Hey, just wanted to let you know I made my own trays like you show here.  Was already using the Plus White but Oh My Gosh, Using the homemade trays has made so much difference!  And my stains were really old and set in. My next favorite thing is how inexpensive it was to do. Thanks Kandee.
Thank you for this video!  I can't wait to try this one out :) I have super sensitive teeth and don't like to do the strips over and over for two weeks. I think I might be able to tolerate this whitening process.
Can I use a gum shield
Kandee do you find that your enamel has started thinning from whitening? Like you I'm addicted to having white teeth! I use pro enamel tooth paste most of the time but the bottom of my teeth are looking kinda…thin :(
do u only use this to whiten ur teeth or have u had a dentist whiten them as well? jw cause id love to have perfect white teeth like urs! :)
Could u please do a celebrity make up if ellen degeneres
I was actually at a stop light and there was this truck driver right next to me. I smiled at him and he smiled back, and when the stoplight changed I have him a big smile and a wave and right before we drove off, he pulled his horn and waved back with a big smile! I think we made eachothers day and that's the best gift ever!!
what about the bottom row of your teeth?
what is the kit called?
Thanks for the Awesome tips! :0
I love you!!! Iv been watching you videos since I was 17 and now I'm 24 years old!!!
Sweet! Thanks for sharing chica! Like always you make smile! God bless!
Would you have any idea what to buy in UK to whiten my teeth xx
Thanks, Kandee, for this awesome, educational video
Can you use this even if some of your teeth are "built up"
Oh and sorry about your dad
What happens if you swallow it
I am really sorry about your dad
We don't have walmarts since I live in Belgium :/
Kandee this really works girl! I already had a mouth guard that fit my mouth. The Plus White 5 Minute Gel really works! I love it. Now I am camera ready. I do a lot of TV work and print work. Thnx so much. :-)
Will try this!!!
Awesome! Thank you
Beautiful smile. .
I will try it!!
This woman is awesome!!!
Kandee- Thank you so much for this video. I have always been so self conscious about not having very white teeth. I have tried a few things and I did get some results but not much. I have been doing what you show in the video for the last few days, and I am so happy with the results already. Thank you so much for the great advice. You are so beautiful and you rock. Thank you for helping me boost my smile confidence!
But what about the bottom row hun
KOOL IDEA KANDEE. 《~;
Do it work for braces
How long do each mouth guard/whitening tray last?
I love the lipstick
What is the name of the song ha ha ha ha XD
you post this on my birthday
Among all the people that've watched in youtube tutorial, you are the most good-looking, well explained, sweet, and the nicest person! I love watching you!
You where really pretty when you where 16. btw, you're still pretty haha
I love watching your videos!! but how would you whiten the bottom teeth?
Ahhh I should have watched the video before I bought it ...I need to buy a separate mouth guard now lol.
They sell a kit for 2 bucks more with a mouthpiece and rinse!  Trying it tonight and so excited!  Thank you Kandee :)
Hi Kandee! I have braces and I was wondering if you have any tips to keep your teeth white you have braces?
Tx for sharing. Yes I agree a smile does make a diff. 100 P agree !
Hi Kandee... I thought the rinse was suppose to be used before the gel.  Isn't it used to help remove debris from the teeth..??
I'm doing this right now . I suggest that if your going to do this, use a tray. It's not fun without !  It would probably be more effective with a tray as well.
So I just tried this kit out but I used some dentist tooth whitening trays I bought from Amazon and those things didn't mold as well as the mouth guards in the video did but I didn't find them online or in store :\
You always brighten my day even if you didn't have a super bright smile! Keep on smiling, sending you hugs too.
Loved this
SUBSCRIBE TO THE NEW BEAUTY CHANNEL, AMVEZZY, please and thank you!(:
Kandee you're awesome and I love sharing your videos with my own clients and friends!  I've also used this product for years and have done the expensive custom trays and whitening and I agree this product is inexpensive and just as effective!  Keep the videos coming.  You have such a wonderful glowing personality that we all adore.  :D
made me smile kandee :)
Love it! Thank you so much for this!
Is there a certain way you whiten your bottom teeth? I'm just curious, maybe it's already been made obvious
YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL PERSON
How about the lower teeth?!
I tried this before and it didn't work for me! Now I'm trying Dr. George's we shall see
I have the same sink :)
Which asile was the mouth guard? Lol I looked everywhere for it :/
What about the bottom teeth? How do you do them?
Just started this tonight! Thanks tons kandee! I actually suggested this to a few strangers at the store and showed them how amazing your teeth look, so they of course bought all this too! :D and yes people obviously you do the same for the guard on your bottom teeth lol <3
you are so cute!
Damn i have freaken braces
but what about your bottom teeth?
Totally did this after I watched it and I can see a big difference! Thank you!
Awesome
<3!!!!
is it okay to use that kind of mouth guard to use for whitening your teeth because the mouth guard is made of plastic and i'm just trying to be cautious!
finally went to the store and bought this yay!! hope to see the results.

who's told you that you look like miley cryus you are more beautiful than her
Thanks

How long does it take before you see results?
Can you please make a video on how you do your bottom teeth?
What about the bottom teeth? Buy a separate try for that?
and the bottom teeth?  Do you use a mouth guard for that too?
Wait what about the bottom? Do I buy a separate mouth guard for the bottom and repeat the same process?
Lies /:
What toothpaste do you use?
I'm soooooo trying this

What happens if you swallow alot of it? I didn't but I just think it would be nice to know :)
What about the bottom?
What about your bottom teeth?
Wow!  As a make-up artist, you spend a lot of time promoting products.  How much are you reimbursed for these persuasive commercials to your unsuspecting fans?  Cash or free stuff?  These name-dropping product placement ads undermine your credibility, m'dear!
does this really work?
Love your lipstick color! What's it called?
This is fantastic! I can't wait to try this!!!
You are just SO perfect !
Hey! I just started a beauty channel and I'd like to reach 100 subscribers! If you subscribe to me, I'll subscribe to you! If you like my videos, I'll like yours! If not, no big deal :) thanks everyone!
You only show how to whiten the top teeth. Does it work to do the same thing for your bottom teeth?
You know you can also use baking soda with lemon
Love it,  The end of the video made me shed tears.So true.  My dad  also recently passed away and just seeing someone smile at me makes me feel so much better , because of that I try to smile at people more often. <3 :)
Your daughter is so cute:)
Does this work with braces?
Thank you SO much for this cheap trick for teeth whitening! You are AMAZING!!! Xoxo
I'll send you my new smile!!
I used to have braces so now I have a metal wire retainer thing on the back of my bottom teeth that I think might be permanent.. Can I still do this?
What age can you do it?  Cuz im 12 and I wanna do this
What does it taste like? Is it gross tasting?
That's was awesome I've been doing this for 2 days and it's doing its job. Thx kandee !! ( Tiffany)
<3
Why did you delete your other teeth whitening video??
I love ur personality
kandee, I love your videos and everything, but I'm a bit confused. You said you've used that since you were a teenager, but I saw a video that you did a few years ago about another one, were u advertising this whiting pack? Just curious.
Does it work if you dont have straight teeth?
Kandee merry Christmas !!!!! Why did you remove the whitening lightening video??? I love you
Thank you thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!
I'm gonna try this. I hope this works for me!!:)
Can u do this when you are younger
Brought tears to my eyes at the end Kandee. Youre such a sweetheart. --Thank you for so many helpful hints! Love your vids! Hugs to you, girly!!
I'm just sitting here feeling vaguely jealous because my teeth are super duper small and they look terrible
Can you do this if you have crooked teeth??
Could you be anymore beautiful in every way ?!? Oh my god you're amazing!
If you had braces and still wear those clear plastic retainers can you just use those instead of buying a mouth guard?
totally going to try this
does anyone know a system for braces? i get made fun of because my teeth are really yellow and crooked but i have braces now and i dont know how to whiten them now :(
WAIT GUYS you do not leave it for 5 minutes - you need to leave it for 15mins because the effect of whitening begins at 5 min so if you take them out at 5mins you will get NO results
Did you use this while pregnant too? Thanks!
omgshh, this is seriously the greatest thing ever. i've spent soo much money on those expensive sticky strip things and they've never worked! thank you for the awesome tip! (:
just bought it today, hope it works as well as it does on you ;)
I'm sorry that your dad died
This is awesome! Definitely going to try it ASAP!
Hi kandee thanks for this, i Will try it. The solution you use at the end, is it really necessary? Because i thought i only by the gel and tray. Kiss from france
CUPCAKE IS SO BIG!!!
Can I just use my retainer as a tray or do you recommend I use the mouth tray instead?
Definitely going to try this lol
Definitely going to try this lol
omg your awesome thanks for the video :)
Or u can just use tumeric, it whitens ur teeth and it costs u very little money! 😊 It works in one use
I bought the Dial A Smile whitening kit and was wondering why you took down your teeth whitening video down...Now i think i know why. It SUCKS.
it made my teeth more sensitive, but works for some people.
thanks for sharing. unfortunately this product isnt available in the UK but thank god for Ebay. even though the price is ridiculous (cheapest £16.49) from the comments and the video you shared, i think its worth a try.
i cant wait to try this.. im a new subscriber! i just love you. my husband will be happy as well. thanks kandee
Why can't you use it if you have tooth sensitivity?
How long to the trays last? Should you make new ones after a while?
awww girl. That is soooo sweet of you...You are sooo right. Being hateful is soo easy to do...and you see it too much! A smile really can help somebody hurting :( ....i meant... :) :)  :) hahhahaa
AWESOME GIRL...i think you did this video a longgggg time ago! lol. I am going to have to try this again! cause i just want quick quick results haha. but if i stick with it i know it will work!
hi kandee
U r so pretty :)) can i use it if i have a retainer on the back of my teeth?
Just tryed yesterday and its working, i'm so happy about it, Just wanted to thank you you saved my smile yooohooo :D Bisous from France xxx
Safe with dental work? Like fillings? And how about bottom teeth? Whiten those with a different tray?
Can I also use a retainer that already fits my teeth as a tray, or is it better if I melt the mouthguard?
I just adore you
Does this affect your teeth? Like...the gum or...whatever? Is it healthy? Thanks! C:
HI KANDEE. I HAD A QUESTION . IF I HAVE CALCIUM DEPOSITS IN MY TEETH , YOU KNOW LIKE THE WHITE SPOTS WILL THE WHITEING HELP OR HELP TO LIGHTEN AROUND THE DEPOSITS AND HOPEFULLY MAKE DEPOSITS LESS NOTICEABLE?
Update! My Plus White gel arrived today and I tried it out straight away. I made the trays exactly how Kandee did and it worked perfectly! The problem for me was applying the gel, it is SO messy! I applied it with my fingers as that felt easiest, and put my mouth guard in. When I put the mouth guard in it pushed the gel up onto my gums. I tried to wipe it away but I was drooling all over the place and my gums were KILLING so I washed it off. Maybe I'll get used to applying it in time?
Good idea! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So unfocused but great video
Just love you to pieces kandee! You make my day so much brighter when I watch you! I get super excited when you pop up on my feed!
How long it takes to start seeing the results? I don't have really yellow teeth, but for me it looks like is doinh nothing, and i started leaving the gel on mu teeth for longer than 5 min.(10min)lol
They sell the tube at dollar tree. I've been using it for years!
All I found at my Walmart was black mouthgards.. Hope it still works!
Definately gonna try this
That was the greatest video you have in my opinion!
Is this safe to use during pregnancy??
Do you do a tray for the bottom as well? I don't know if you mentioned it in your video or not... Thank for the tip tho!
Do you think they'll have this in other stores besides Walmart?
can i do this with a filling ? in my moller type place
Hey kandee is it the youth clear or adult clear please answer ASAP can't wait to try it
What about the bottom teeth? Wouldn't they be yellower than the top teeth since they aren't getting whitened?
What brand of toothpaste is that?
Does is damage the teeth?
I cant get the gel here in the UK what should u do
WHY ARE YOU OUT OF FOCUS!!!!!!!
Kandee, you are so cute! I absolutely love you and your channel! I made a tray for my upper and lower teeth and this works great for me. Stay beautiful!
Thanks for posting this Kandee, I've been doing it for only 4 days and already see a difference!
Kandee, THANK YOU for this video! I saw it when you first uploaded, and I've been doing it for 10 minutes every day since (Almost a month now) and it really works!!
Wait kandee , what about down part of teeth? Is it only able for upper teeth? *sigh*
Uhm this product destroys/burns my gums....like my gums turn white in some places and swollen. Its horrible. I don't even know if this product works because I keep it on for even 5 minutes because it hurts SOO badly. I love you Kandee and thats exactly why I bought this product....but I'm not so sure about this product :(
Can you do the same procedure for the your bottom teeth?
can you do the same thing for your bottom row of teeth with the tray & everything?
Talking about smiling, could you please do a video about how to treat and hide your under eye wrinkles? few tips: not too much powder?
Do you have to use the trays?
You're so sweet and awesome.  Going to try this!
GE NI OUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome tip Kandee. Thanks for sharing. 😀
Cool, gotta try this! Tx!
does it make your teeth more sensitive?
Your not in focus ALOT...
Have u ever tried using the sensitive formula? ive used it like 20times for 20mins and my teeth are still ivory naturel.... like mildly yellowish, with absolutely no change. I bought the sensitive version off ebay... do u think its expired or the sensitive version is just ineffective?
Why? Just why are you so awesome?! :D
how do you do the bottom teeth? with another guard or do you just put the whitner on them
Wonderful girlie!!! :)
I finally got the gel in the mail!  (I also ordered the trays but they didn't mold well :'() I used it once yesterday without the tray for 15 minutes, and it whitened my teeth a liiittle bit. I tried it with the trays today for 20 minutes and people are already asking me if I did anything to my teeth LOL I spent ~8 dollars, and this works waaay better than the Glo products I tried. Thaaaank you so much ; w ; <3
I meant on the other video of the make up tutorial for Wreking Ball ! Miley
5:15! You look like Jessie J ! Like a lot !
OMFG PLEASE FOCUS UR CAMERA :(((((
They carry the SAME whitening gel at the Dollar Tree here in San Diego Ca.! I swear!!
And does it damage your enamel?
What lip color are you wearing here? It's gorgeous!!!!!
Where can i order it? I live in europe
Your daughter is an angel bless her , + Thanks for the amazing video it worked perfectly for me ! xo
I'm gonna try this. Hope it works ;)  Will I see results same day I do the "homemade" treatment or does it take days/weeks for it to work?
I must know what lip color you are wearing in this video! It's gorgeous!!!!
I've whitened my teeth in 6th grade (approx. 11yrs old at the time). My teeth has turned a little yellow from smoking over the past few years. I've quit for almost 2 years now so I want to re-whiten my teeth. Problem is when I whitened my teeth when I was little, I had no idea what I was doing nor had any supervision. I just now tried to find the product online but can't find it. I remember squeezing a little tube of whitening paste onto a tiny paint brush and painted it on my teeth, then going to bed with it on, then brushing it off in the AM. My teeth is now sensitive to coldness, sometimes they'll feel super wiggly like they'll fall out. Also the ends of my teeth KIND OF looks transparent. I really want to give your suggestion a try but do you think my teeth will be okay? If not, what is a more safer way to do so? Price doesn't have to matter. PLEASE help/respond! ):
You are the sweetest heart EVER!!!!!! I love your positive ness ....please continue to share that love you soo much!!! Xoxoxo
She's a cutie
If you go to the website, you can get a coupon for $2, Kandee! Thanks a bunch. You just made our day!!
I wish I could do this but my teeth are soooo sensitive. :(
I love this thank you so much for saving me money, can't wait to have pearly whites like you!
Was that your daughter
Was that your daughter
I tried this and did not work  for me :/
did you delete the video where you used the whitening lightning?
my teeth is so white i could literally kiss you! thank you soo much! :D
I cried when I read the comment about a girl loosing her grandparents, you are truly amazing and put a smile on my face everyday,  thank you so much for the videos and positivity, love you! :)
Since you use the mouth for the top what do you do to your bottom teeth?? I have the plus white stuff but I don't want my teeth top be two different colors.  Could you also do it without the mouth guard??
could you do it like every day? or at least 4 or 5 times a week?
Literally doing this right this second! Hope it works. Thank you, Kandee! xoxo
Ahhh, much cheaper than the Crest White Strips I've been getting. Will have to try. I'm about to get Invisalign...hope my teeth end up as straight and white as yours!!
U R Great!!!!!
Is it safe for kids
Can you use it if your top 2 teath are crossed
I tried this and i got blisters on my gums and really hurts. I whiped it off really fast and still didnt help... Im scared to use it again :(
Thank you Kandee!;)
Your smile and encouragement have brightened up some of my days. Just knowing your out there being cheerful helps me be more cheerful too. Hugs for the toothy help.

Kandee u dont know how much u inspired me to be a makeup artist I have watched all ur makeup tutorials and I wish I was right in front of me so I can give u a hug. Thank u kandee.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ANSWER!!!!! Do you use a second mouthguard for the bottom teeth? or how do you whiten those??? LOVE THIS VIDEO THOUGH THANK YOU:) I want to try this out but i want to whiten my bottoms too:)  PLEASE LET ME KNOW:)
I will definitely try this!!! I have a unique shape to my teeth and trays from the dentist are so tight.
What polish are you wearing? I need a good white polish
Kandee, how often should  you do this until you see results? Is it almost immediate? My teeth aren't super yellow but could use some tlc. :) Thanks in advance!
Such a useful video!!!!!
Thank you when I went to the dentist they said"Wow you cleaned your teeth":-)
Thank you so much for this video! I've always been self conscious about my teeth and  have been wanting to get them whitened for ages but it's just too expensive. I've ordered this kit (I live in the UK so can take between 15-20 days- getting impatient already!) and can't wait to try it! Really hope it works for me. Will leave some feedback in a few weeks time :)
What toothpaste is that ?:)
THANK YOU THANK YOU!! i have no idea why but my teeth are really stained from coffee and certain fruit acids and its terrible yellow. i am going to but that stuff now ! to see if it works!! will message you to see
Hi lovely Kandee!  Has anybody told you that you look a lot like Diane Lane? you could pass for her sister easily.  Even your eyebrows looks like hers.
Do you get a second mouth guard for the bottom teeth?
Using this in the shower is BRILLIANT. The inconvenience of drooling over myself was always what kept me from whitening on a regular basis.
Have u ever tried using the sensitive formula? ive used it like 20times for 20mins and my teeth are still ivory naturel.... like mildly yellowish, with absolutely no change. I bought the sensitive version off ebay... do u think its expired or the sensitive version is just ineffective?
What about the bottom teeth?
I'm definitely subscribing to you-you're so cool!
You see, I do use that 5-Minute whitener, but I had some difficulties for leaving it on for the full 5 mins because I didn't know I was supposed to use that guard so my mouth would be hanging open for 2-3 minutes and I'd have to be careful to not swallow or taste anything. Now that I know that I'm going to make a stop to Walmart.
Kandee, i need ur help-i love ur headboard and was wondering if u made it urself? If so, could u please do a tutorial on it? I JUST don't know where to begin to make it myself and any info u could provide would be greatly appreciated! Thank u so much in advance. Love & hugs to u & urs. michelle
What lipstick(s) are you wearing here?  Thx!
Can i use my retainer instead?
You are such a happy and energetic person! Your videos bring a smile to my face everytime :)
Thanks so much for making this video! I've been wanting to get whiter teeth for ages now and finally now I can without spending loads of money having it done professionally! Love you Kandee ♥
2 dollar off manufactures coupon on the Plus White website if anyone is planning on buying this soon. Expires the 30th of this month
How do you do the bottom row of teeth?
No have  that stuff in Indonesia .   :/
Do you know if it's true that old teeth whitening products lose their affectiveness after a certain period of time?
Nice video! Thanks for sharing.
I'm trying this right now! Haha my Walmart only had black mouthguards, so I look a little scary with them in. I love the Plus White gel! I used it with the horrible mouth tray that comes with the kit and was impressed with the results, so I'm hoping that they're even better with a custom-fit tray like this :) and I love that there's no sensitivity. Even some whitening toothpastes make my teeth hurt but this doesn't.
Love you Kandee! Your videos just put me in the best mood!! You are beautiful inside and out! Xo
Kandee, you are too awesome! Thank you for making this video for us frugal folk. I also love you makeup in this video! Could you please do a makeup tutorial for it?
Oh no its out of focus):
to protect ur gums i would rub Vitamin E before whitening
You have a very beautiful smile :)
Love the little smile speech you gave at the end. So precious!!! You're awesome, chick. xx
Kandee, I have a question. I heard the new formula of plus white doesnt work compared to the original formula. I bought the new formula before I read the reviews. Do you agree that the new formula doesn't work at all? (The one you have in the vid is the one I got)
You sounds just like Gwen Stefani
U are so cute and enthused lol
Wow KANDEE !! cant wait to try it . thanks heaps
Your teeth are amazing.
What happened to the lightning whitening video?
Hi Kandee! How do you do the bottom?
What happened to your dial a smile video???!??!
can you do this on your bottom teeth too??
Thank you so much for this kandee!!!!!!
Kandee you are such a wonderful person - someone truly Exceptional at everything you do ! You always brighten my days - I love watching your videos ! I just love you ! :)
do you prefer this or the whitening lightening kit??
I love it!!!
Love this video! You are fun and informative, I really enjoyed your message at the end of your videos. You are a total inspiration to so many woman and mothers. Keep on Keepin it real beautiful
Oooohhh the little girl she is so cute ....♥♥♥♥♥
Excited to try this!!!!! Thanks :-)
Great technique! Thank you so much for sharing a wonderful technique like this. Keep it up!
Muchas gracias por la informacion pero ninguno de los walmart cerca los tiene.
But what happened if you have REALLY sensitive teeth? Does it bother your teeth at all?
Oh nvm lol I literally asked that right before you said the thing about braces xD fail
What if your have braces??
Does the mouthguard have to be clear or can it be the colored ones?
Great idea! Ty!
This worked better then crest white strips which is great because its so much cheaper. Thanks for all your wonderful tips and tricks Kandee <3
would you do the same with with the bottom tooth
How do you do your bottom teeth?
I LOVE YOU KANDEE!!! You are a ray of sunshine (more like a bunch of rays of sunshine)!!! Your positive and love life attitude is so contagious….I LOVE IT!! Thank you for your videos xoxo
I was thinking about how to get my teeth white. And i am so happy to know how you this. I almost went to an expensive company. :o So thank you for this video! Haha much lovee xx
Holy crap! That's so cheap compared to the $40 crest whitening strips
What about the bottom teeth? Do the mouth guards work flipped upside down???
Hi kandee loved this tutorial! Question, can I re-use the tray? If so, up to how many times? Thanks in advance♡
Thankyou for this amazing tip Kandee! Gonna start tomorrow! Also, I know this sounds weird but I say "chippy chips" too! It just made my day that you told Ellie that!!! Hugs and kisses (and brighter smiles) -TIFF
oMG I love my THEODENT 300 TOOTHPASTE :D
Oh Kandee you are such a ray of sunshine!!! Whenever I feel down I always remember your sweet little  voice reminding me that I am Beautiful, talented, and oh so very loved!!! You truly are a blessing in my life! Two years ago in late august my sweet grandmother past away and then that October my grandfather past away, and the truly hard part is that I live right across the street from their old house, I am constantly reminded of them. And things were getting really bad, but then one day as I was browsing thru YouTube, I came across a video of this beautiful woman with long dark hair, and I (not knowing what to expect) clicked on it. That video saved my life!!!! I'm not even kidding! You have no idea what you mean to me! But yet all you see is a username!! But anyways, even if you don't see this comment, I just want you to know that I love you so much! Thank you for keeping me positive even when it felt IMPOSSIBLE!!! Again I love you! Thx<3
aww. i just got my braces and i need them for two years :(
Kandee - how do you ue this to get your lower teeth bleached/lightend?
I've been using this for the past few days and love it :) Very affordable- thanks Kandee <3
YOU are so adorable and first time like 3years when i stard learn make up you was my first teacher i love you alot :)
You are amazing woman!
Your taxes.... are only 7.1% daaaaang. Nice. Good tips, thanks
Will try it ..i love it! Thank you so much ;)
Hey Kandee, I wanted to know if the mouth guard is either youth sized or adult sized. Thank you!
That mug is absolutely adorable! Where'd you get it?
Love you video. Here's an even cheaper way to whiten that a friend told me about. She got it from her dentist and it works.  1. Brush with toothpaste and floss. 2. Swirl some peroxide in your mouth for a minute or so. DO NOT SWALLOW. Spit out peroxide. 3. Immediately start brushing your teeth with baking soda. The baking soda and peroxide interact to whiten. In a week or so you will see the whitening take effect. I refresh a couple time a week. It really works!  People always asked me what dentist whitened my teeth.
What about my bottom teeth??
It would be amazing if you did it
Plzz Plz Pl P Pl Plz Plzz
Please  Pleas Plea Ple Pl P Pl Ple Plea Pleas Please
Do a morning routine please please Pleas Plea Ple Pl P Pl Ple Plea Pleas Please
@kandeejohnson Can you use the mouthguard agian? Or just once?  Hugs ly xxx
Can you reuse the mouth guard or should you replace it everytime? Also how long does the one tube usually last?
Wonder if you can order these things on amazon? :)
Thanks Ms Kandee for this awesome tutorial. I'm definitely gonna try this. The Listerine mouthwash I use works OK, I wanna see if this will work better. :)
i love you so much!! <3
Sorry if you've already done this (I'm a new-ish sub) but please do some videos on how you stay looking so young! Share your secrets, haha! X
:((( so theres nothing i can do about it
:((( so theres nothing i can do about it
i couldn't find your dial a smile teeth whitening video what happened ? and you still use it? do you still like it? btw you have the most perfect smile love you xoxo
Love this :-) was just watching your original one. Am favouriting these :-)
You're so sweet, Kandee. God bless you.
My husband and I are doing this together! Thank you for showing us something that is so budget friendly for us!
You are Fabulous Kandee!  ♡ ♡ ♡
If I only have the gel, can I use mouth wash to rinse or just regular water?
you have very nice white teeth
thanks so much Kandee! I love watching your videos :) you're truly an amazing person! xoxo <3 :)
thanks so much Kandee! I love watching your videos :) you're truly an amazing person! xoxo <3 :)
Ok I found what I needed at the base in Germany. It was a long shot but they had what I needed. This totally work. I can't wait to share this. Thanks Candee!
Follow me on instagram please @little_mskat and @fashionbeautysenses
Thanks so much !!!!!
Love this video! I've tried some other things so I might as well try this :) thanks kandee
I used crest white strips once and it cracked my enamel. I bought this today. I hope it works!
Thank you so much! I'm getting my braces off soon and I can not wait 💕
This was awesome tutorial. I buy those mouth guards for my son every year for football and never thought to use them in this way : )
What's this classical song called?:)
Anyone from australia know what whitening brand we could use instead of the one here?
The First Video i Saw of yours was your old version of this :) And it made me just love you and your amazing personality so i subscribed and im glad  did, you are wonderful <3 i Love You Kandee! :)
I can't tell you how much I wish I had pretty teeth. Really affects my self esteem..
does it taste bad?
What about the bottom teeth ?
You already made this video before.
omg! Thank you Kandee!!!! This video is awesome! I'm so excited to try this, you're a friggin genius!
My tooth whitening kit tells me not to whiten my teeth. Oh well.
wow you are beautiful!
OK I have a ? for ya? How do you make your face to have that porcelaine look after you have on your moisturizer, foundation, and used concealer. Then to seal it with powder. I did leave out to use the bronzer and blush before the powder. I've used a conceler buffing brush and that pink spung, sorry I can't think of the name of it lol, to apply it. I just feel that I don't have that beautiful smoothness look that I see in all your video's. Could you help me find out the way or method that I missed? Thank you the bumpy face girl! JK   ;-)
I LOVE that green cup, where is it from?
ILY KANDEE
what about the bottom teeth ?
All of the people asking about the bottom teeth... are you serious????? I don't want to be mean in any way, but c'mon! It's the same process! You spend 97 cents for another tray and do the same thing. Why is that so hard to figure out? SMH.
I can't wait to try this. You're the best, Kandee!
Just as a fyi....if you go to the website for Plus White there is a 2 dollar off coupon you can print out!!
Do you have to use the rinse?
subscribe to my channel i just made it an i love watching all ur videos
Thanks kandee!!  I'm so going to try this.
Miss Kandee!  I watch your videos before I go to bed and I love that you know the insider tips and have such a wonderful soul too!  I'm watching Long Island Medium and wish that Teresa would give you a reading from your sweet dad!  (hugs to you Lovely)
I love your little gingerbread man cup!! It's the cutest.
I meant bottom
Can you also do this for your bottow row too?
I wish you could get that teeth whitening kit in England :(
How would you do the bottom teeth ? ;o would you just make another tray but for the bottom teeth ?
Thanks a lot!!! You are damn gorgeous ;)
Where did your Whitening Lightening one go?
You just won yourself a new subscriber girl ;)
will it work if i use my plastic retainer too? :)
Draw your life pleaseeeee!!!!!!^.^
What?? why do people say her voice is annoying?? It's the sweetest voice and it always make me happy listening to her! Besides, her singing voice is amazing!
Could you use this for your bottom teeth?
Could you cue this for your bottom teeth?
But her teeth are soo white <3
But whitening your teeth removes tooth enamel!
.
Kandee Johnson ! Perfection ! ♥ :D
You are my favorite youtuber Kandee! Thank u so much for all your videos. This was such a easy cheap tutorial! Loved it!!!
Hi kandee, I wish get the same white teeth!  I tried the dial a smile after your previous video, it cost almost 60$ And doesn't work on me! Now I'll try with this cheaper method, and order it to France. Is it safe?
Could you still use the same each time
you were GORGEOUS at 16!!! of course you are still gorgeous! kandee you are beautiful inside and out! <3
How quick are the results? :)
What if you want to whiten your bottom teeth?

But what about the lower teeth ?
i always smile and say hi to people i walk by, you never know who's day you'll make with it! :) i love you kandee
Wouldn't you need two mouth guards? Another for the lower teeth?
Kandee baby! Do you do the same thing for the bottom teeth???
only I think that u look like Victoria Justice ?? XD  Ok im watching your videos here and.. hmm 2 hours and I always say ok this is the last one but never works You are from the Best YouTuber beauty gurus. . You and your smile make the day of people who they are not at the best mood ;) Keep Working Girl !!!! ♥
Thank you Kandee!
I love you Kandee for all the positivity and joy you gave me! :)
I love you so much kandee, I really think of you as my sister who ive never met :D huge hugs!!!!
thanks for the awesome tips! you are such an adorable human being <3
Kandee, this was so helpful, but the only problem is that I live in Europe and we don't have a walmart here. I got really insecure about my smile since it got really yellow. I used to  smile a lot, but now I'm just insecure to smile ;(. Can you help me get this product? Also I'm 15, and I don't have a lot of money to spend on x (professional) bleaching. Love you
What toothpaste is that?
Im so trying this thanx for this awesome video! By the way, should we buy two mouth guards? So we can do the bottom teeth as well, right? Lol just want to make  sure. love ur videos!
I got antibiotics as a kid which werent meant for kids and are taken off the market years ago. They made my adultteeth really yellow and brown on the inside. Have u ever heard of this? Nothing works for me..  Btw im from europe is there a similar product here i could try?

Awww I have braces..:/
Do you also create another mouth guard for bottom teeth?? @kandeejohnson
WhT about our below teeth?
A friend of mine used a tooth whitening thing at home and it made here teeth super sensitive? Are there difference formulas? Like do some have higher bleach content?
This is so helpful! Lifesaver :D
Loved your Video !!!NEW SUBSCRIBER{:
Trying this today!!
Great Idea I have a mould impressions of my teeth made at the dentist and I normally pay almost 30$ a syringe of whitening gel will def give this a try
I'm going to try this! :)
I went out and got the mouth guard after watching your original video for this method! But I havent found that gel at my local stores. So I did the whitening lightening with fair results. I guess I have to figure out what else I might need at Walmart to make the 25min drive there worth it!
I love plus white!
Omg, your daughter is SO cute! All credit goes to you, for being the most amazing mother anyone could have. We love you, Kandee! <3
Does it matter which plus white system we use?  I found that there were several different gels from plus white online
جميل جدا
I love you much Kandee! ❤️
Love this, will be hitting Wal-Mart tomorrow!!  What lipstick are you wearing?
0:04 nice black dot between your teeth you got there...
Thanks for sharing!  It looks very good, but is there any side affect after using?
You are so right about how a smile can change someone's day. Even if you force yourself to do it, it can help you too! You are so beautiful! Keep up the good work!
Just use clorox and you can have most whitest teeth in the world
Thanks for this video! Can you tell me where u got that tufted pink head board from?
what about the bottom teeth?
How do you whiten the bottom teeth? I couldn't find a bottom guard when I went shopping.
Hi kandee! how do you recommend whitening the bottom teeth using this product? oh and by the way i love your videos! and congrats on hitting one million subscribers!
Hey, Kandee.  I just went and bought some of that gel (I didn't even know they sold whitening gel in stand-alone tubes, and that it was so inexpensive!).  Here's hoping it works!  Thanks.
yes finally a good way to whiten teeth thank you
I'm most obsessed with your lipstick here! Does anyone know what it is? :)
What about the bottom teeth?
This is amazing! I pay soo much money for my teeth mould trays at the dentist and no one has ever told me about this technique you've shared. Thank you sooo much your truly amazing
do the same for the bottom teeth ; im assuming ?
Hey Kandee! Once I've made the mold, can I use it over and over again? And also, do you just do the same thing for the bottom teeth? Thanks, love you!
Kandie, I love your uplifting videos tips- and I am your momma's age, how is she doing?
what about if you don't have a Walmart in your country??
What kind of toothpaste is that???!!!
I Love You <3
Luv u kandee!
What is your lipstick? it looks so good!
Awesome video! Love the mouth tray trick :) you are the best
Kandee you are my teeth savior! I bought a kit that actually made me do this with  water to make a mold. It cost me 30 dollars!
I love u.
Thank you so much! This was an awesome video and I just did all the steps!
Your smile means the world to me
thank you so much this is just what I need...i never use any bright lipstick color because my teeth would look more yellow.. I HAVE A QUESTION: how do i whiten my lower teeth..do i make a another whitening tray fer them too?? I dont want one jaw whiter than the other!
Thanks for the tips, unfortunately we don't have this kit in France :(
Thanks for sharing....I love your headboard. Where did u get it?
So true what you said about the smile at the end........one smile can turn darkness into light for someone :D
IDK, if some truck driver drove past me while I was walking alone down the street, I might be more creeped out than anything lol jk.
Can you make a new video of applying false lashes?? The old one is with your old camera :/
do you have to make another teeth tray thing for the bottom part as well? o_O
Does it make your teeth sensitive??
Thanks so mych Kandee..um gonna try this. Asap...
Would this work for sensitive teeth?
Where did you get the kit?
oh  true ahaha
What about for the bottom teeth tho? Same thing?
awesome. cant wait to try this!
that is an awesome tip, thanks Kandee! you are super awesome
I think your voice sounds happy and uplifting!
Eine Klein in the beginning. (-:
I'm sure you get this all the time, but you actually look so much like Marilyn Monroe. Look up a photo of her with no makeup on. You're the same person!
This is awesome! Thank you so much!
You remind me of a Disney character  ")
we just made bleaching trays in my dental assisting class and was curious what kind of whitening gel i would use once my sample dental gels were gone. Make sure to mention to some people that the whitening gel can irritate the gums so do not put it there!
Just went for my 6month check up yest. I was in the waiting room looking at the poster advertisements they had up on the walls. One was of a whitening kit the dentist sells. I asked how much($75)...I wanted to go back and buy it tomorrow & I run into this video!...thx Kandee!(first video saw you in was the lemon scrub)you are AWESOME! Xoxo =)
Kandee can you please do a tutorial on decorating Christmas Ornaments? It would be cool to see what you come up with because you are so creative.
omg, you were so cute! you're just as cute now as well,lol :)
quick question, is this technique better then the dial a smile kit?
Great video thanks for the tip  Your daughter is so cute and you are so beautiful  I hope to meet you one day and give you a huge hug  Love you ♡♥♡♥
Hey Kandee! I just absolutely love your hair! I'm planning on getting a pixie cut in December and I would love to get the cut that you did. So, I was wondering if you could make a video on what you told your stylist how to cut your hair, the way you style it, and the way you trim it. Or if you could comment back, that would be great! :)
smile, smile, smile. I will mean the world to someone, love ya kandee
Love love!! Thanks for sharing!
HEy! PLEASE SOMEONE ANSWER THIS! i would like to try making a mold but i have permanint retainer in the back of my bottom teeth. do you think it's not safe to do this sesne i have a wire in the back of my teeth? or would it be ok?
Hi Kandee! :) great DIY video. Just wondering if it makes your teeth sensitive?
Kandee,  Will this technique also whiten porcelain crowns?  My 2 front teeth are crowned (abusive EX husband knocked them out)....I'd love to whiten if I can!
aww , your daughter is sooo adorable . < 3
Exciting!
Can you make a video on how to shape and fill in eyebrows especially light brows pleas and thanks
THANKS!!
Hi kandee ! Hi Ellie ! Lol your so pretty kandee !!
*fancy goblet*
you are so sweet to share this!!! thank you! I am definitely going to try this.
I just tried this and love it!!! So easy and so cheap! LIVE YOU KANDEE!!!
I can't wait to try this! I use the Crest 3D white toothpaste, and it lightened my teeth a little, but on my front teeth it only lightened the bottom half, so I have a clear line of demarcation right in the middle of my front teeth! Hopefully this will help get rid of it!
I love you Kandee! Your teeth are PERFECT! I was wondering how much the kit is and where I can get it! Thanks
Ran out and bought me a new kit (your old video was my first KandeeJ video too, then the lemon one...lol) with the $1 off coupon...yay!!! And as I was headed to check out i picked up the sweater you have on too! (Usually hate those but I noticed you cut yours in the back so maybe that's the trick!) Thanks for STILL being my role model after all these years (inside & out) ...even tho I'm 32! Lol <3 Your BIGGEST fan! <3
do you get these in the uk? xx
I remember the first time you ade a video like this :) I tried it and it worked. Does this one make your teeth sensitive at all? My teeth get sensitive very easily :(
My birthday party is tonight and I am going to try this before hand so my teeth will have a little extra brightess. You have the best tips! I love you Kandee!! xo
I have been thinking, when dentists whitens teeths they protect patiens gums. But when you do that at home you cant protect your gums. Isnt that dangerus
Or brush your damn teeth ever day
4:36 Hi Ellie!
What were you wearing on your lips here kandee? Love the color!
Giving you a biiiiig smile :-)
We don't sell both of them in the netherlands, so sad right now.
You are very attractive, sorry you lost your daddy ! ! !
ok for the top,but how u do for the other??
Well it's good but I have permanent retainers at the back if my teeth help?
Thanks for this vid it has helped love u
I LOVE to smile...and the 80 year old man that lives across the street from me always tells me that if he was a younger man I would be his girlfriend because I have such a "beautiful white smile."  TOO CUTE!
You're such a sweet and kind person. You're videos always cheer me up :D
Kandee it works smiling at people just because...When your in your car in the warm sun and you turn and smile someone its amazing the reaction, its like paying it forward. Watch a movie on netflix called ZEITGEIST it is a documentary, very eye opening. Love
Wow your teeth are obsessed white!
Kandee, do you drink coffee or teas still after whitening?
You're gorgeous when you were 16! And still are
Your original tooth whitening video was the first video I ever saw of yours. It's nice to see an updated video :)
I like it
Now i can have white teeth for 2014 thanks
where can i get those stuff in malaysia! need it badly for my yellow teeth...  sob sob
I swear you are the most genuine and sweetest person ever.
Kandee! Question :) Do you also get another tray and mold it to your bottom teeth? Or how do you do that part??
Wow! Kandee I lost my dad in fen he was a truck driver long haul. What you said rings true in my life. I love your how tos keep up the great work,,
Candy what lipstick are you using here?? Looks so beautifullll xxx
Great vid I use that too, question do you know if that mouth guard would work for your bottom teeth, and congrats on your 1million mark , I watched the vid on your site it was beautiful, you have such a big heart, love u honey:-)
Just wondering.. can this harm your teeth ?
Thank you!!! I love you Kandee
Brilliant! Thanks Kandee
Dang... I have to. Wait till i get my braces off....
Question! Can you use the permanent retainers that orthos give you after you get your braces off? Like the plastic molded ones? I don't want the chemicals to damage it! Thanks Kandee!
What about the bottom teeth do u need a second mouth guard
Thanks so much for posting this! My boyfriend and I have been wanting to whiten our teeth but never knew what to use because we have been to tight on money! Now we are going to try this for sure!
Would I be able to use the whitening kit/gel with my invisalign instead of using a mouthguard?
That's such a cute mug! Where's it from?
Thank you for this. This is so affordable for viewers opposed to the $100 kits other yt gurus are pushing.
Thanks for this money saving video! I am so excited to try it out.. I always love your videos and you always brighten my day!
Thank you Kandee!!!!!
Love this! Good to know the cheap kits really do work! P.S. My niece called them "chippy chips" when she was little, too!!! :D
OMG WHAT IS ON YOUR LIPS?! GORGEOUS!
Did you get that cup at the Madonna inn
How do you do the bottom teeth? Make a second tray?
what about the bottom teeth?
This is what I do too!!!
how long do you think it will take for us to actually see a difference?
Ive used this product for over 5 years and it works!! I love it! Kandee you're such an inspiration to be a wonderful person and listening to your advice has made me a better person for it! Thank you for that!
Off to buy my mouthpiece. You are a life saver Kandee. Been trying to think of ways of having a whiter teeth without spending much kaching ;-) answered prayer!
Beautiful teeth
Amazing ! Never seen this strategy but I'm positive it's gonna work ! Ur teeth r so white btw !!
Thank you so much for this, I tried it and it totally worked!!
Love you!
Kandee, you Rock!! <3 you
kandee at 16,,,awwww :) :)
I love this thank you soooo much !!
Just watching your videos makes my day that much better, thank you for doing what you do.
what's the brand of the mouth guard? I'm having trouble finding it.
Oh cool I'm gonna have to try that! :)
I remember your first video about your teeth whitening routine and you have had me hooked on this stuff since :)
My teeth tend to be very sensitive,  can  I still use that system?
Kandee, you are so amazing:) Your video really brightened my day and I love you! Thank you for doing what you do!
I have this and love it
Will this bother me if I have sensitive teeth?
Do I need the Plus White mouthwash? Or can I just use my own mouthwash? Trying not to buy the kit and just the tube itself! Thank you xoxo
Ahh no focus!!
I have a clear retainer just like to he mouth guard. Could I just use that instead? Of melting the mouth guard and stuff. Please reply I want to know before I go a but his this stuff   -thanks :)
What about the bottom row
I love ur nails can you do a video showing what you do and stuff like that plz
That Up Close Shot of Kandee's Mouth is So Hot!!! It's Almost like The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
how many times a week should i do this process and how many uses are the mouth guards good for..please reply kandee i want to start whitening asap:)
16 year old kandee looks like victoria justice
Can you make one for your bottom teeth?
Myself, typo
Plus White is good! I have it myseld
would this be safe to use with your own retainer? I might have to get a tooth implant so I want to whiten my teeth before just in case. And will this make my teeth more sensitive over time? I just want healthy pearly whites :/
I LOVE YOU & your videos. I watch all the time. I have a question though. Do you use the same mouth guard to do the bottom and mold your bottom when your doing the top? It looked like you only did the top?
It wont mess up a porcelain cap?
I'm soo gonna try this out ! ♥
I have braces and my teeth are pretty white but not as white as yours. Can't wait to take it off so I could do that trick.
So going to try
I love this stuff but I can't use it too many days in a row cause my teeth will get sensitive ... so I alternate.
throw do u do the bottom?? Please answer
FOCUS
You looked so beautiful then and flawless now. <3
And what about my bottom teeth? Help? ! :0
kandee your videos make me smile even on days where I'm bummed out thank you:)
Would this hurt on sensitive teeth?
I loved the video I added it to my favorites :-)
Loooove you Kandee!
How long does it take for your teeth to get white
I started doing this ever since you did the first video!!
Thank you
saving you dollars and making you look good!! lol love itt!!
KANDEE!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU'RE A LIFE-SAVER!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you, darling <3 --Aaron
Every time I watch your videos Kandee u make me smile and make my day all better!
Ur a genius! !!!!  Love you & that sweet little girl of yours!!
How much is the gel ??
I will never get tired of any videos or any of your remakes Kandee, love you :)
does this work with braces also?
I love your remake videos! Its so nice and fun to watch the old tutorials but in really great lighting! :)
Watching this while whitening teeth with same kit
awesome tip!  thanks for sharing.
you have awesome teeth! if i went all close up like that on my teeth.. and watched it, i'd probably throw up a little. hahaa!!! beautiful! i've been using this plus white forever too.. and hydrogen peroxide!
I need that :((((((
how well is this stuff for very sensitive teeth?
So the whitening kit was easy to find at my Canadian Walmart. Finding the football teeth guard extremely hard, actually I never found one. Hockey mouth guards, yes! So I am just going to try the guard with the kit until summer or when hockey season is over.
I LOVE YOU KANDEE
IT’S A BEAUTY CHANNEL WHERE I WILL BE DICUSSING FASHION TRENDS, MAKEUP, HAIR TUTORIAL AND EVERYTHING BEAUTY AND FASHION RELATED. I ALSO WILL ALSO FEATURE A FEW LIFE TOPICS THAT AFFECT YOUNG ADULTS LIKE SELF ESTEEM, BODY IMAGE AND LOTS MORE.
HEY GUYS, MY NAME IS PRINCESS AND I’M NEW ON YOUTUBE. MY CHANNEL IS CALLED GLAMOURLAND CHANNEL .
REALLY HELPFUL TIPS. DEF WILL TRY THEM OUT.
Does anyone know if I can do this without the mouthguard? Is it just sort of so it locks the gel in and I don't accidently lick it off? :P
You just made me cry. Im catching up on videos trying to keep my mind off my sons complete spinal fusion in 2wks. He has had surgery every 6mths since 2009, same yr my dad passed away. Im soo emotional lol!! Your little story about smiling at someone is so true :) thanks for the tip!
This stuff does work. I actually got it from watching your old video on this, but I do notice that it can irritate my gums, so I don't use it too often or no more than 5 to ten minutes. It's strong stuff.
Can you mold a mouth guard for your bottom teeth too?
You are absolutely gorgeous!
Yay!! I'm gonna do this when my braces are off thanks Kandee!
Its it just me or is Kandee blurry most of the time?
Whoops... I just meant goblet! My bad!
SO happy you did this video again!!! You are the best!
Did you get your "goblet" at the Madonna Inn??
Omg ur the best
Thnx
And if no then do u have to melt it everytime
Kandee do u have to replace the mouth guard every time u do this?
That little bit at the end was great Kandee. God, why do you have to be so smart, goergeous, AND kind !? lol you're a true inspiration and an amazing, strong woman. I'll never stop watching your videos :)
Thanks for this video going to try it out ;)
Kandee you have a heart of gold
Thanks so much for this video Kandee!! I've always had not-so-white teeth because I'm a coffee and tea drinking addict, lol =) I've always wanted to try the Crest Strips but they were always too expensive for my college budget, so this seems PERFECT to me =) I love your smile, it's so pretty =)
Hey girl does it make your teeth too sensitive??
i just discovered your channel ! i love your smile :)
you are beautiful
You are so adorable, I want to squish you! Thanks for the fantabulous tips!
LMAO LOVE YOU!
Hey  Kandee ...i really love you sooo much... and i watch ur videos all the time...u truly making my day...kisses from Cairo..plz come and visit :*
Quick question Kandee: a have a cap on one of my teeth matched to my current okay buy not nicely white color...so should I leave things as is, or whiten? The cap is in the back of my mouth, so not super noticeable.
love you! but this video was so blurry kandee!
You're smile can brighten a room! You are such a positive inspiration to the girls like me who like to hide behind a computer screen! <3
Wow i feel like ive been lied to my whole life by the toothpaste companies! o.O
Wow, genius ! Thanks 😃
What is your lipstick?
Bad quality tho

In my list to do today!
How do u do the bottom
Awesome! I've been wanting to find something to whiten my teeth with! Thanks for sharing!

You have great teeth :)
Candy you are so sweet in all your videos! <33
Love this!
awsome tutorial kandee! ive spent as much as $50 on those whitening strip kits and they just slide around in your mouth and feel really uncomfortable. this looks so much easier and a lot more affordable too! thanks for sharing, and your teeth look amazing! <3
What about your bottom teeth?
Loved your sweet message about one smile making someone's day. Thanks!
i will try this...hope it works.
will give this a try...
Hey what lipstick are u wearing.?
How old are you ?? :)
I love u too Kandee u replied back to me !!!!
I can't wait to get these! I love how genuine ur sweetness is, Kandee!
In Wal-Marts across the country, Plus White sales out like crazy!!
Omg 16 year old kandee is so beautiful!!
Love the beginning. How very "Rocky Horror Picture Show" :)
Hope that really works. My teeth are so yellowish after removing the teeth bracelet.
Has this product caused you to experience any tooth sensitivity?  I have used some other tooth whitening products (Crest Strips & a more intense whitening toothpaste) which have caused my already somewhat sensitive teeth to become sensitive to he point that it is incredibly uncomfortable.
Thank you!! I was tempted to buy a system but I will try your method first!
Do you have any tips for thin hair Kandee? My hair is so thin and I feel like it just keeps shedding. It's so annoying.

How often is this safe to use? Weekly, once a month?

:)
You have gorgeous teeth !
Do you re use the mouth guard? And if so how long till it needs to be charged
Ooo i so want to do this
I'm trying it right now but I had to buy a child mouth guard because they were out of the adults it works though (:
Great think i paid 300 bucks for teeth withener at the dentist just yesterday....but those things are probably only available in the us
I have braces :(
What about your bottom teeth?
Your teeth are so flipping white !!!!!!
I have a veneer tooth. Will this work?

Did you see that you got tagged in the the "no hands makeup challenge"? I really want to see you do that one. It's so funny ^_^
I want your teeth..
You are so pretty in this video! <3
What the heck kinda toothpaste do you use? It's a pretty tube! Haha
Ellie is so cute! Haha, and thank you for the tips. I've been drinking coffee for years and no matter how much whitening toothpaste I use, the stains won't go away. And thank you for showing a method that isn't expensive, because I can't afford anything since I'm in college lol.
I always end up writing down your little quotes and putting them on my memo board :)
I think I'm in love with you.  But wait, I'm straight. I'm confused. Lol.  You are cute as a button!  I swear. Love your tutorials. New subscriber.  Just love your energy....and I lost my Dad a couple of years go also, so I know exactly what you meant by your comment about the truck dirver.  <3  Cheers...

Kandee! You are an absolute stunner, I hope you know that! xx

Love this! And why do you think your voice is annoying? Lol You have a lovely voice doll, don't let anyone tell you otherwise
I had braces and have some bright spots on some teeth from them :(
Is there a UK equivalent? x
Kandee, do you know if there is any long term side effects to whitening your teeth regularly? I mean, are the any risks one should be aware of? Tks! Xoxo
I remember the original video you made of this. Ha! Thought I'd share. Have a great day!!
"saving you dollars and making you look good" hahaha love you kandee <3
I can't wait to try this when I get my braces off!
i heard whitening too much can damage enamel, so kandee have u had any issues?
Love ya.... great smile ;)
U r soooooo sweet. :)
Isnt it so that if you have cavitys (not sure thats how to write it) you shouldnt use whitining?  Oh and for the commenting, some people have made they have disabled replies =/  Hugs from Lilli =)

What about the bottom teeth?
Aww cool thanks kandee you're awesome thanks for making this video
I used to be a very happy person, but because of some struggles in my life I just got more serious and not so funny as I used to be. BUT, since I started watching your videos you reminded me that no matter what problems you may have, being optimist and smiling is the right solution. Thank you so much. Love you.
Thank you sooo much soo needed this and the beautiful advice! !! Xoxoxoxoxo
Love the Classical music in the background.

Isn't it really bad for your teeth??
Ok. You are one of my major role models kandee and you have one amazing heart.
Kandee didn't you use Crest strips before? Ugh I wish we had cheap teeth whitening stuff like the USA
Can this work for the bottom row of.teeth?
Thanks Kandee!
you have perfect teeth and smile omg
Why did you do a video about crest products,if you knew this method before????
16 year old Kandee is as beautiful as Kandee now! So pretty. And Ellie is such a cutie pie.

I love you Kandee!! Thank you, thank you, thank you for all your beautiful tutorials. Your such a sweet & wonderful person. You dont know how much your words have helped!! I have had severe depression for 3 years now. And had stopped living literally, but you have been such an inspiration to me to get up & live my life! Taking care of myself first & loving myself, have been the first steps to help me get up & take care of my family. I know God steered me to your videos! Your an Angel. God Bless you always & your family...
Is that rinse or ANY rinse needed AFTER that whitening gel???
Is it safe if you have a few cavities?
I never get tired of your videos! As a dental hygienist, I'm glad you mentioned floss and the fact that whitening does not work on porcelain :) Good information!
I wana try this but I'm scared :( lol love ya Kandeeeeeee! your so awesome!(:
I love u Kandee thanks for all the wonderful videos and for putting a smile on my face, your videos put a biggg happy smile on my face every single time I watch, Hugs and Kisses Frm New York xoxo

Hey sweetie I'm also a certified ortho and general dentistry assistant ( retired ) and happy someone finally mentioned floss .. Lol! You still got it girl all your info was spot on , love ya ! Ps.. Your trouble commenting back has something to do with a user not having it set to public. Older comments on some of your other videos October and before will be blocked too ..( let's makeup) talked about it earlier. Xo hugs back.
Ur so beautiful and inspiring(:
Kandee you are sooo beautiful !!!! gosh I love you!! :-) I am so glad you are back in action!!! xoxo
How would you do bottom teeth?
My teeth are porcelain, so I can't whiten them.. Boo
Whoa! OK! I'm so going to try this>< THANKS KANDEE! <3
I buy the same whitening gel at the dollar tree for a buck
Brilliant, love it!!!
This is perfect! Definitely trying this! Thank you so much for this!!!
Omg ur teeth are soooo prefect!
What if you want your bottom teeth too?
Thank u so much for videos and all u support))) I love u)))
I love this Kandee!! How i wish the products are available in Malaysia. I'm currently using Crest 3D whitening strips. It makes my lower teeth sensitive. Yicks! But anyways, I'm sending my flying kiss and virtual hug all the way from Malaysia. Love your video so much! ;)
Whered u get the wiitening thing??
I love you so much!!!! You always are an inspiration to me. When something really sad happens watching your video really is on my list of favorite things. You truly deserve even more recognition then you already have.
Kandee, you're so pretty!
I have to try this!
U did this all ready .... Right?
Your daughter is so cute
love you kandee!!! =]]]
What's your opinion on crest 3d whitening strips, toothepaste kandee?
How do you do the bottom teeth😬!!?
Thank you so much Kandee! I have the whitening kit and never really used it because I hated the mouthpiece. Now I can have a comfortable mouthpiece and a white smile tor a cheap price :) Thank you!
i used that teeth whitening gel for a couple of times and my teeth got very sensitive :(
I have braces u think I can still use it like a tooth paste
16 year old Kandee OMG
I adore you!! Fantastic idea- I am totally trying this!
I wish I would have known abt this sooner. Whitening kits are soo expensive!
Love you kandeeeeee
Hi Kandee What lipstick are you wearing?
How about bottom teeth?
Thankkk you soo muxh :) AND OMMGGG ur young self is sooo pretty too <3
I love your head board for your bed! So pretty!
THANKS KANDEE!! I'm going to definitely try this! I hope it works for me!
Thanks this help for my boyfriend cause he is a smoker and I :)
soooo helpful
What about the bottom teeth Kandee?
Love you buuuut the camera's out of focus sometimes :(
YESSSSS
Can I use it on my bottom teeth
I've never heard of making your own tray!!! Thank you sooo much this was fantastic!
I have that stuff. My problem with whitening stuff is my mouth salivates and my muscles get tired so I can only do it for 5 mins
OMG your replying to comments? OMG OMG OMG fkfkfnfnfj I love you so much kandee!! Your such a inspiration and fingjgjgjgng okay bye thank you for making me smile :) ily 💗
I love this technique Kandee I've been doing since your very first video of whitening that you did! I suggest putting gel on your teeth as apposed to putting the gel onto your custom tray. It'll hit some cavities you thought you didn't have and hurt pretty bad haha
Wat about the bottom teeth?
Hi can you help me please!? I have this little red bumps on my legs and my friends said that their called chicken skin and I really want to get rid of them
I was in Italy this summer and as I was walking around, an old lady was walking towards me, so I smiled at her. I think I caught her off guard cause she did a double take. The smile that grew on her face and her Italian "hello" that she said as we passed made my trip. It made me so happy that I was able to hopefully brighten her day just with a smile.
Your daughter is so cute <3
Once again Kandee you brighten my day even When your just talking about teeth!! #love u!! I will definitely be trying this once I get $10
nice tips Kandee..good mouth guard idea!
what is the rinse stuff afterwards and do i need it??
you are wonderful! I had a hard day and your love and smiles make everything seem so much better.
One day I had a really bad day at school and as I was walking home I began to cry as I continued walking a nice man who worked as a trash truck driver gave me this big as smile and said to me, "don't cry you'll have betters days, I promise" it really is amazing how some simple words and a smile can make your day so much better
Hi Kandee, big smile from me for you ;-)  is it possible to order the whitening paste? I'm from Europe/nl and it's not allowed to be sold here. Love your vids, have a good one!
Oh my goodness Kandee!! You were soooo cuteeeee!! you still are, dont misunderstand me, you are gorgeous xD
Hi Kandee! You responded to me earlier and it totally made my day!! Do you have a PO Box where fans can send you something? :) I can't find it anywhere on your blog!! Xoxo.
☻/ This is Bob . Copy and paste him /▌ all over Youtube / \ so he can take over and take down Google+
What was this lip color? It's like the most perfect nude ever!
I love you, I love you, I love you! Finally, something to give me the confidence I need. Thanks so much, doll. Don't stop being you, Kandee! I love your gitty personality! My 3 year old daughter sends big hugs to your little one! 💗💗💗
Hi Kandee! Thanks so much for this video! Definetely going to try it! One question though, I have a retainer from when I got my braces off and its the little plastic tray kind that fit my teeth, is there any reason that wouldn't work (instead of getting the football mouth guard)?
Thank you this is great!
Love u kandee!! Thanks for ur videos!!!!
This is AWESOME! Thanks, Kandee! :D HUGS!
Going to definitely try this over the weekend! Whitening systems are so expensive and takes days to get results.... Hopefully this works out. :3
Can you buy the kit in the uk?
What about your bottom teeth?
Way cheaper than the whitening strips!  Gonna have to try this!  Thanks for sharing! :))
THank you for updating the whitening video, Kandee. I have naturally more yellow enamel, so I really need to get the mouth guard and a system! Oh! Today would have been my Daddy's birthday (November 13th). He passed about 8 years ago, and I just had a very happy dream about him the other night. I hope that you have happy dreams about your father, also. In my dreams, he's always so happy! I love that. It's nice to think of him smiling. Many hugs and congratulations on your youtube award (and your lovely family!)
What about the bottom teeth?
Can you just re boil the guard and use it on your bottom teeth?
Thank You!!!!!
This is such a good video! Thanks for posting this!!! xo
Kandee ur eye color looks       Amaz-ballz in this vid!
i neeeeed to know what lipstick you're wearing lol.
Will me a birthday video it's on Friday I'll be 13 YAY!!!
Thanks for this tip! I was contemplating on buying the $30 Crest whitening strips last night, but I'm definitely going to try this instead!
Great idea. Loved it.
your daughter is so adorable! you are such a wonderful mother ^_^
what about the bottom teeth?
Awesome idea!
oh my gosh! great idea :D haha thank you :) but i need to wait for my braces to come off first XD
I've tried this product before, but if I got any of the gel on my gums it would burn and turn it white for a little bit. Does that not happen to you? I noticed you got some of the gel on your gums.
I love you! Your an inspiration
Awesome that's as cheap as cheap can get gonna try this real soon! *hugs*
Kandee can you do a review on the urban decay naked pallet 3??
Def gonna try this thanks a lot
I've been using this for the past few days and I already notice them getting whiter!! It really works!! Love u
Sorry gel not heal lol at the front of each tooth space then just smoosh it in when you put the tray on :) and always avoid your gums (the gel can damage them)
Also works great if you apply a little bead of heal
what about the bottom teeth?
Thank you!
Do u drink coffee at all?
Video with Alani Plzz
Love this!!!!
i love your voice kandee <3 i find it so calming and soothing!
I felt like you were out of focus. Still loved the video!
Clever!!!!!!
I remember your first teeth whitening video! You got me into using these :)
Does anyone know where to find this in Canada? I used to see it at walmart but haven't been able to find it there in quite some time.
Chipy chips <3 :3
That's the same thing I use! I've been whitening my teeth for over 10 years.
I was using something similar - white perl, but it made my teeth weak. Kandee why no longer white strips? is it bad? Dont you recomend it?
Can you do this for the bottom layer too?
is the mouthguard the "youth" size?
Kandee what about Your bottom teeth?
So how do you whiten the bottom??
Bless you for this video
Your voice is the best. I love it girl! Don't be sorry for nothing cause you're perfect.

So cool! Also, I really want you to adopt me. ;)
What about the bottom teeth?
You have THE most perfect smile ever wow
I've been here since the old video :) Is that an accomplishment or what ? :)
i loveit super good
Hey kandee or anyone who can help me....to do your bottom teeth can you use the same method of not? Please help!
Ah the end made me cry. I love you so much!
Great tip!! But my favorite part was that little angel in the background :) XOXO
Your videos kandee hands down are always the most helpful
I'm doing this as soon as I get my braces off
ever since you showed us that other video on how to whiten your teeth with the plus whitening it is all that i use. thanks for doing an updated version kandee.
I love how upbeat and friendly you are :) you're my favorite beauty guru<3 love you, Kandee!!
Any more homemade face masks coming our way. Would love a video on that.
You like so cute when I were little
Oh my Gosh I'm going to try this thank you!!!! Luzzzz you Kandi!
Dang it. I just got braces :(
love you kandee!!!!
what about your bottom teeth?
Kandee I have a ? Appealing after the gel and putting the mouth guard. And leaving about 10-15 min. After removing the mouth guard can I brush my teeth again or should I not???
And your voice is fine; love it!!
I have also used this for years and love how well it works and my dental hygienist always comments on how great my teeth look!  I never use a guard though.  I simply take a Q-tip and rub the gel all over my teeth, leave on for a few minutes and rinse and brush with the plus white toothpaste.  Do this several times a week and your teeth will look great.
This is GENIUS!!! I'm definitely going to Wal-Mart!!!! Love you Kandee!! Thanks for sharing!!
Have you EVER had issues with sensitivity? Not wondering about the pdt but rather just trying to gauge for myself if maybe you just usually don't get sensitivity (or whether you do but this pdt is good for u) thank thanks thanks for sharing!! :D
Love how you show us cheap ways to be beauutifffullll! I love u! Thanks Kandee!
I had liked this video in the beginning, then went to try and like it again, it was that good :)
Lol I love how Ellie popped up at the end
I am SMILING at YOU right now you awesome lady you! XOXO
That blurry nesss thoo
I'm a dental assistant and this was a great idea kandee you are right way cheaper than going to the DDS
Loved this video! So helpful also, if you have a chance check out my winter lookboo!
I have soft spots on my teeth do you think I can use this even though I have that??
Omg kandee you know exactly what videos to make!  I was just about to search this and ur video popped up! Thanks kandee going to Wal-Mart right now!
Wow! We got all up in your mouth! Lol! Love it!
Ugh I get my braces off January 2015
This is what I do!! Yeah!!! I am seeing results. You can use Arm and Hammer advance white toothpaste to make it whiter real fast!
OMG I love u !! I wish I can meet you /.\ u seem sooo nice
So what basically does the trick is putting the gel all over the teeth and the mouth guard over that and that'll make your teeth brighter + whiter?
I just bought that and I agree the,mouth piece thing is horrible thank you for showing me an easier way to use it
Love this idea, must try asap. I want to meet, swap, and collab with you lol!!! Love ya!
does anyone know what other stores sell the whitening product?
Thank you!!!!!! :)
I love how you actually showed the receipt....priceless
what about your bottom teeth? D:
Hi Kandee! I have this and love it. What lipstick are you wearing in this video?
I have braces :,(
hi candy! I really love your videos and you just put such a big smile on my face :) so thank you for always being so cheery and beautiful and for being youself! I love you!

Kandee is so sweet and so genuine.

Oh my goodnesss! Ellie has gotten so big, I remember the vlog from when she was just born!!
Kandee your so pretty!Today was like my worst day ever and your videos always get me happy:$
It's so weird you did this video right when I decided to whiten my teeth!!! Thanks love
I used this for a month and it didn't work. I read on a forum that they changed the formula and ppl were complaining about it. The new formula doesn't work too good
Thank you
I LOVE YOU KANDEE THANK U
Can you get the plus white in Canada,  does anyone know?
Thanks.... I will try it this weekend :)
Kandee! You share such amazing videos! Thanks so much for doing what you do.
Thanks for this video Kandee. Its amazing to know you dont have to waste so much money to whiten your teeth. :)
YES so glad you remade this video! SERIOUSLY the best and cheapest teeth whitening method! i cant wear strips a whole lot because it bothers my gums and i cant wear the trays because my mouth just isnt big enough lol but i just paint it on my teeth with a q-tip and it works GREAT ! Going to go whiten them NOW!
I love you so much!! Your gorgeous, and it's so much fun to watch your videos. Thank you for making my day a little bit better;))
Ive used plus white for years. I love it!  Thanks for this video. ..not all of us want ti spend 100 bucks on teeth whitener!!
can you use the mouth guard for the bottom teeth? You have a  Beautiful smile :)
This stuff really works!  The kit comes with its own tray, but the mouth guards definitely work better.
Kandee, I have bonding on my front teeth. it's the same stuff they use to fill cavities. Can I use this on MY teeth? BIG HUGS! <3
Kandee, is this as good as the 3-D  white strips?? 😜
How could anyone mind your voice? You're amazing Kandee, never forget it.
Yay! Woot woot I get to save money. I veen wanting to whiten my teeth soo I think I just found the easiest way. Thank you kandee you are The bestes :) a huge smile from me to you :D lol
I would love to try this, but since I'm pregnant I'm not going to risk anything d: But it seems like a very easy way to brighten your teeth, I love it and will try it as soon as I would be allowed to! You're awesome Kandee!
can you use your retainers (invisalign) instead of buying a mouth guard?
I love 16 year old Kandee's eyebrows! you look so pretty!
Can you use this with braces?
What does it taste like? I really hate minty things.
what about the bottom teeth?
awwww Kandee, the end story about the smile then Ellie is so cute. I love you! And I'm sooo glad this is so cheap! I'm about to get this stuff right now!!
I love u kandee, my teeth aren't straight and their also not white, but I still share my smile with the world,I love to brighting someone's day even if I can't brighten my own, thanks to u and your joy I always look forward to a better tomorrow :)
When I watch your videos and you say all the encouraging words at the end...it ALWAYS makes me smile :) thank you for being you Kandee!!! And keep it up! God bless!!,
I get my braces off this weekend and I'm really excited to try this

Kandee I'm a dental assistant the glide floss doesn't pick up all the plaque the you might have in between your teeth.
videos like these are why we subscribe kandee! youre greattttttttt
Kandee your a incredible true inspiration!  Whenever I'm feeling down, I always watch your videos to cheer me up!! Your so amazing!! I love u!(:
Hi! I have a question. What if you have a retainer that's just like Invisalign? Can I use that instead of a mouth guard?
I love you videos on how to  whiten your teeth  and can you please do videos using the toothpaste to whiten your teeth
Didn't you already upload this video a few years back?
Is it bad if the gel goes on your teeth's skin?
Seems simple and inexpensive. But afraid of the teeth sensitivity. Urghhhh...
I haven't been game to try a whitening kit on my teeth yet
:)
I am so excited to try this! I love finding new ways to whiten my teeth for super cheap. Thanks so much for sharing this Kandee!!! You're so awesome :)
Wahoo! This is awesome, I've been wanting to whiten my teeth for a while but some of those whitening kits are sooo expensive! Thanks Kandee, your DIY videos are always so helpful :)
You've had so many jobs!!!!!
Sad to me that you still shop at Walmart! Here's to hoping that you become more socially conscious one of these days :-)
So Kandee, I had braces and got an acrylic cover over two teeth, can I still try this?!
You had so many cool  jobs and you are and were beautiful
Kandeee why is the focus of this video off throughout?! Your face is slightly blurred
I love the old photo you stuck in there of yourself!
great videooo :)
Yay! Going to try this!!!
Thank you so much Kandee! I love your videos!!!
Kandee do you whiten the bottom as well? If so, do you wear a bottom guard at the same time with the top guard? Or do you do them separately? Haha. The mouth guard looks a bit thicker on the bottom! Thanks for this tip Kandee :D your teeth are so gorgeous, and your smile always brightens my day :D
love u. You're smile makes my day better.
<3 Kandee Your So Sweet!! Your Personality Is So Addictive!! Im Gonna Defiantly Try This!! THANKS!!! :D
That was such a lovely story with the truck driver :)
do you have a clicky jaw or tmj if you got it checked out?
Your videos always make me smile! You are so cheery and fun to watch!!!
I use this  too. It works!!! No sensitivity bought at riteaid or walmart
Hey Kandee! I actually just started using this last week.I got the kit with the gel, rinse and tray and it seems to be working, though I would advise avoiding getting it on your gums. I did once and the gel really irritated them. >.<  Definitely going to have to try your trick with the mouth guards, though. The tray it comes with is a little uncomfortable. Thanks for a great tutorial!
This is genius! Thanks Kandee!
Kandee you are perfection! I wish that I could be as positive as you! Your outlook on life and everything amazes me and I love you so so much!!!!!!
Can you do this with the bottom row of your teeth too? Also can i just buy another mouth guard for the bottom?
I chipped my two front teeth and I have caps now, how can I whiten them?
The ending on this video was absolute perfection. <3 ya Kandee!!
i love kandee!! shes so awesome!!
Kandee!! Are you supposed to buy a new mouth guard every time you try this out?
I love this video♡♥ Thanks Kandee!
How is this for sensitive teeth? My teeth are super sensitive and I've been wanting to do a whitening treatment but I'm afraid it'll hurt.
Wow, your teeth look professionally done! Love you kandee and your adorable ellie (:
Wow, your teeth look professionally done! Love you kandee and your adorable ellie (:

Thanks! You're amazing Kandee!! Love you :)
Thank you love it. :)

How do u do the bottom teeth
how do you whiten your teeth on the bottom
Thank you!
Can you make a video on how you take care of your nails please??
Your teeth are gorgeous! Xx
Does it make you teeth sensitive/ cause any pain? I'm too nervous to whiten my teeth because I've heard so many bad stories
I will definitely try this!
Stains *
How long did it take to actually see results
Your like my fairy godmother! I swear now that I'm in college I drink coffee all the time & it sauna my teeth :( I've been wanting to find something cheap, not 50$ crest white strips! Lol thanks Kandee! Going to try this out :D <3
Hi! What kind of whitening product was this exactly? Want to look if I can get the same stuff in Germany. :)
Did you have to ask your dentist before using this system!? I love it!
Kandee! Thanks for doing this because im really insecure about my yellow teeth and i dont want to bother my parents and make them spend fortunes just for my teeth! Imma try it and see and brw i lpve u! Stay KANDERlicious! <3
i love when you say so huge hugs from my house to yours! it makes me feel so happy! love you!
Should we not whiten our lower tewth?
I get my braces off in about a week and I'm so exited!
Holy cow this is a lifesaver for me! I'm a broke college student that can't afford all these beauty products beauty gurus talk about haha but this seems reasonable :) Thanks Kandee! <333
Hi Kandee...thanks 4 doing this vid, can't wait to get to Walmart and give it a try. I just needed to ask you if you ever have any problems with sensitivity  during your whitening process?? I always have this terrible like feeling of like electric shock or something (hope u know what I'm talking about) that goes thru my teeth, but it would happen 2 me every time I've tried whitening my teeth. Well I've only actually tried the crest white strip and I had to give the box of strips 2 my sis because it hurt. So if u have experienced this sensitivity with other whitening treatments...do u also feel that sensation with this whitening product as well??? Thanks luv♡ . Sorry 4 writing so much.
Thank you for this!! Gonna try it ASAP
You confuse me !! You do a lot of tutorial on whiten teeth treatment ? What is good one ? or you do it for money and don't care about your subscribers
Kandee, what kind of lip color are you wearing?  Its so pretty
What lip color were you wearing? (Or is it your natural lip color?) :D
genius love it
I agree with you because I can not comment michelle phan and it is driving me crazy
Thanks this is a great vid!! But make sure you are in focus because this entire video your face was out of focus.
what about teeth sensitivity? :) oh and why you stopped using crest strips?
Is it the same routine for the bottom row of teeth?
What about my bottom teeth ?
I professionally whitened my teeth when I had a bridge put in my mouth but the gel gave me terrible headaches. Have you ever had this happen to you?
Hi Kandee I'm one of your biggest fans and your my idol and if you replied back I would probably die I think you're so pretty and Ellie is soo cute I want to steal her from you !
I love your videos!!! ,I have been a subscriber for such a long time and every time you upload a video I get so exited! Keep doing what you do best ,xoxo
Thank you so much! I have been looking for a very cheap way to whiten my teeth
Finally someone who doesn't use the Crest whitening strips!! Those things really messed up my teeth. I'm going to try this though! thanks Kandee :)
Thanks for the great tip!  Have a good night!
I've never seen plus white in Ireland, all the teeth whitening stuff here is expensive...
Thanks so much <3 Love you Kandee! Just wanted to say how much your videos mean to me. I've been watching them for years and I love you <3 hope we get to meet someday! Smiles are a HUGE way to share some love.
I've been using this for years but only recently got the mouth guard.. I find it makes me drool and is so gross haha.. It's like I'm at the dentist. Is there any way to help this?
Awesome!!!! Thank you! I will definitely try this!
I have really sensitive teeth. Do you have any recommendations for people with sensitive teeth?
Can't wait to try this! I use the Rembrandt Deeply White Toothpaste but I want something stronger and my teeth aren't bad I just want them super white!!
I'm sold, I'm on my way Walmart
oh my god you are perfect ;)

Your teeth are perfect! (:
You are my absolute favorite!!! Thank you for sharing!!!
I'm from England, do you think they will sell the teeth whitening product in our Asda stores? xx
ilysm
I'm in the dental field and the mouth guard totally works to hold the gel however getting gel from the drug store is horrible for your teeth. It has no flouride in it to protect your teeth. You can buy the gel from a local dental office for about 50-60$ and it will maintain your white smile for months. And not strip away your enamel like the stuff from the drug store. Remember once enamel is gone, it's gone forever. In the long run your teeth will have no enamel and you will need crowns. So why spend 1500 per tooth (crown) then just pay 50-60 every 6 months? Just a heads up (:
this is what i use too! I'm so happy you use it too ! haha the personal tray idea is awesome thankyouuu [:
We have no whitening systems in Greenland. :-/ but you have beautiful teeth :-)
but... what about the bottom row? same process?
Can you reuse the mouth guard? Or is it just one use? Help please!
Wow! I can't wait to try this! Thank You So Much Kandee! I Love all your tips & tricks! Keep it up! #ILoveYou!
I wish we could get most of the products you use here in uk as well. I just found one on ebay but was sold seconds after *sniff sniff On the other hand I just feel happy to see you love your happiness and really needed some right now:)
how about the bottom teeth? Same process?
You know why I love you ? Cause I was going to ask you if I can do it with braces but then you answered it haha
GOD! I love your tips, Kandee!! Thx!!!
Wow, I am so excited to try this.  What a wonderful idea.  Thanks Kandee, you rock.
Haha I'm sorry kandee
Your teeth are perfect! I live in the UK so I don't think I can get these products anywhere :(
Wow, your teeth look incredibly nice! I really want to try this, but I live in Norway. Do you know if its possible to order this online, if so where from? You are beautiful and an incredible big inspiration to me, Kandee!
Loved this video!! Thank you so much for sharing this with us, this is awesome and soooo affordable! Love you Kandee, and as always you make me laugh!
Hey Kandee I love your videos!!! Question.. Does this work for sensitive teeth? If not can you do one for sensitive teeth?
I try and smile at everyone, because i smile could save a life.
Thank you for the tips Kandee! Do you use the same product on your bottom teeth and if so how?
what about bottom teeth?
Ps when you next coming to England again? :) x
Ii love you Kandee! So clever and beautiful! X
That's brilliant, Kandee! Thanks
I love ur short hair. Dont grow it out! Lol u look great both way but I love the short. Hey so what do u like better? The teeth whitening pens u had on the other video or this?
You are such a light in the day, Kandee! Xoxo. If you have a chance -- I'd love a video with little Ellie on your Kandeeland channel! Miss seeing her sweet face :)
I'm definitely gonna try this! But what do you do for the bottom teeth
Oh no, my comment disappeared! I will say it again. You are the Sunshine of youtube. Thank you for making my evening so bright while is so dark outside. Goodnight from Oxford!!! xxx
I've been looking for a cheaper alternative to whiten my teeth for so long!! Thanks a million kandee :)
i love plus white!
I just got my braces off. I can't wait to try this :D thnxx
i remember watching your original video on this……and I've been doing it ever since :) !!!!
I'm gonna try this <3 Thanks :*
This seems SOOO much easier than those flimsy crest strips that always slide off my teeth. Thanks Kandee! I'm excited to try this.
Kandee, I am very young, but I am a lover of Beauty. You have been such an inspiration to me. your smile makes me smile :) You are amazing you are such a kind person. You made my day! ❤❤❤
Hello my name is kandie and I am vague. Ho! la la.
Nvm. Should have watched the whole vid
Hi Kandee! You might have answered this already but do you need a new mouth guard for every time you whiten? And if not, how often is a new one needed?
you have a beautiful mouth. this is not meant to sound creepy.
I did that exact same method once and after a couple of days, I got really sick.  When I would smell anything like for example coffee, I would throw-up.  I stopped using it and that sickness went away.
do you do the same for the bottom teeth?
I live in Norway so I dont know where to get like the things you need. But going to try to find so I can do this! :) Ps, you havee very nice teeth!
I have not-so-white teeth, but I worry that products like this could weaken my enamel and/or make my teeth sensitive. Have you had any problems like that?
I just wish I had straighter teeth. :( Braces are so expensive.
I love you kandee so much and I'm smiling at you through my iPhone! :D
hello kandee can i bay it on ebay ?  i'm form france and i can't find it here... love you ! <3
If I have a cavity and whiten my teeth will it hurt it?
Nice idea well I'm only 15 does age matter Kandee?
awesome,.. i love me some kaaandee <3 <3
Sweet! I love that this is easy and affordable. Thanks so much Kandee! You rock :)
How long does it take to work Hun? One use?
Your awsome
I love this idea!!! I can't wait to try this out!
Love you and your videos...congrats again on the 1 million subbies
Will be looking for this on my next trip to walmart! Also, I was wondering what lipstick you wore in this video? Tia ❤️❤️❤️
great vid!
+kandee Johnson
Thats awesome!! You're so innovative!!!  Smiling is contagious!!! I.totally agree with you, a smile can change someones day so much! Your smile always makes me smile:) Ellie is adorable! She's getting so big! Jaja, just fyi, I love listening to your voice! Such a happy sound! I love you, kandee!
Definitely going to try this out. :) thank you for being such an inspiration! My dad passed away not too long ago, so I feel like I connect to you so much more. Your words really resonate with me :)
SMILE : )
Do you know if this can harm your gums?
Ugh! Why can't I comment back to some people! This new commenting system is a little frustrating! ha ha ha
Your so beautiful and i love all your tips and tricks .
I've used that kit! It's great!
Love your videos so much Kandee! I've been searching for an effective inexpensive whitening routine and I've found it! Thank you so much you're amazing!
I'm going to try this! I have a cap on one of my teeth but its a bit lighter then my real teeth so ima make them pretty!
thanks for the video!
How long will I take to get teeth as white as yours? You've had amazingly white teeth constantly and I've never whitened my teeth. :) +kandeejohnson
I wish we had that in Germany.. :/
I wish I could meet you one day, your so amazingly beautiful. A comment back from you would brighten my terrible day so much.
It is sooooo hard to find teeth whitening here in Belgium let alone DIY it. Maybe i should find someone in the US to send me all this stuff, cause i need me some teeth whitener girl
Does the rinse solution come with the tube or only with the kit?
Do you know if Walmart ships international? I'm from New Zealand and teeth whitening products are really expensive here!
That cracked me up when Ellie popped her head up all of a sudden lol
Love love love!!!!! Thank youuu
Wow my sister nereyda tizoc is really exited.that you replied she loves you!!!
I definitely need to try this!
I Love your makeup!!! Love You Kandee:)

See you talking about white stripes in other videos and though you are very convincing I still haven't try them... honestly they are not very common in LatinAmerica, but I guess I'll find them at walmart, I'll see :D love your tips and your personality! :D stay beautiful...  I wrote about you in my blog today... http://missvplam.wordpress.com maybe you want to read it? :D
Maybe it's just my walmart but the mouth guards and the 5 min whitening are both around $11 (i live in canada) ): but i guess its still cheaper then getting them professionally done!
Thank you so much. This was honestly soo helpful
yeah do you think Id be able to use my retainer
oooh thanks so much for this Kandee! love you xx
I am going to try this!
Kandee, what if you have sensitive teeth and gums? I'm scared this will be murder on my teeth! Is there a gel for sensitivity?
Omg 1.your so cute 2.your daughter is so cute ..i just said that and I'm only 11 xD
I just bought this!!! I had seen it on the older video you posted a few years back! Yay so glad you did an update :)
Can't wait to try this! thank you for the tip kandee! You're the best!
Does this make your teeth sensitive? I have tried a teeth whitening system and it burned my gums and my teeth are now sensitive to things. Thanks!
I thought the solution is supposed to be used before you do the whitening?? At least thats what I remember from the kit
Do you use dry shampoo? If so which one? Please help me kandee!!
Wow idk another youtuber that would reply kandee is they ur real name? We'll if it is that's awsome

teeth whitening doesn't work on me :( dont know why!? i paid the dentist to do it and did all the take home kits. would love veneers but don't have the money.
I love this stuff !
Your teeth are awesome!
ANYONE IN CANADA KNOW WHERE I CAN GET THE 5 MIN GEL ?
Thank you for sharing kandee love you
I made one of these mouth guards a few years ago, they're really good. Don't leave the guards in the water too long people. Even a few seconds too long can make it completely melt ha ha. It's really good though! Thanks for the update vid Kandee :)
Definately gonna try this! <3
