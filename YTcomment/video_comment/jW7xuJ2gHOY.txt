Admire your dedication...
First off, AMAZING JOB AND VIDEO!  What type and form of acrylic paint did you use?  Spray? Brushable?  And if brushed, what consistency?  Thick, medium or thin?  Maybe just let me know the name, lol. Thanks.
Thanks for the tips! Just fixed my 10" Techniques bass speakers using glue, money notes (paper, not cloth) & a touch of newspaper. Works perfectly at low to medium volume, with some slight distortion at high.   It had a hole in it from when my brother tried to vaccum the speaker, which eventually ripped around a third of the speaker.
Tissue or toilet paper works very well for small tears/holes, as it absorbs the diluted PVA eagerly. Beware hydrophobic-coated papers, as they don't absorb the glue at all.
Nicely done with the coffee filters! Great tip for my old crap!!
Great job.
Sound check?
Masking tape...
When you do this, how do you prevent the voice coil from rubbing. Sometimes the voicecoil rubs after repair i assume because one side is more flexable than the other.
oh, I used Kite paper too.
Oh about 50 years ago I used to repair/restore speakers including re-doing the winding! Your work brings back good memories - thanks!
Genius! I'm restoring an old Philco Transitone and I've been stalled for awhile looking for a new old stock speaker, but I'm definitely going to try your coffee filter method! Super stoked. Thank you so much ! :D
Wow, very neat. Thanks for sharing to us.
Appreciate this info very much!,
Fantastic tips! Thank you.
Interesting idea with the coffee filter.  I am currently doing a repair on an old Apex 8" speaker with a huge magnet from the 1960s.  I have been using Permatex Black Silicone Adhesive Sealant because the surround where the cone meets the frame needs to be flexible from researching I've done on here and a few of the holes are right up to the frame. How is that coffee filter holding up as I have still a big hole to patch and I may give that a try. Thanks. Phil NYC Area
Comment for visibility. Best how to I've found. Had a pair of old JVC SK-303 and one of the woofers was lightly damaged. Getting a replacement (1 woofer) cost about the same amount as selling/buying a working pair of the same speakers. Did this and it works fine now which is win win since it ended up costing me < $5 to repair.
Nice work  Clothes drier sheets work nice also
Thanks for this :)
Thankyou
Great tips!  Thanks!
This video just saved a 1952 Mitchel Tone-Alarm Radio! Thank you! I am using rubber cement for its flexibility
My 1949 Philco thanks you.
What type of glue and where can I get it?
Can u use silicone around a woofer? That has some smaller holes? And around the end of speakers
Thank yous for sharing
Have you tried a speaker like that RCA with a modern source? I’m just curious how they compare sonically. I’ve heard some that have a startlingly realistic presence in the range of the human voice.
I go to local flea market buy a stereo box speaker 2$ hit with axe add 500ohm resistor for field coil use old speaker for weight to keep mice out of cookie tin .😁
I recently re-coned a pair of 1970s Sansui speakers with a rebuild kit. I know those are from the future compared to the one you did. That was impressive. Can't say I would have tackled one that far gone. Fine job!
Thanks a lot dude. I got super cheap subwoofer at flea market that had punctured speaker and this is exactly the video I needed to get info for repair :D
You do very nice work ,does it matter on what paint you use,if so please tell me more about the pain you used,anyone
Have you ever tried tea bag paper a idea I got from another you tube seems to work.
Where do you find the felt cover for the voice coils,I bought the blue you use also black and clear nail polish,and white glue all the different videos I have seen including clear and black silicone so I can have a lot of things to draw from ,I have a small hole to fix ,raising out a chaos I put a hole in the speaker,I wish someone would make a recording videos for recording it seems pretty involved .thanks.for your video,useful.
Love the ideas here. i will try it out on my emerson speaker. its an old DY-349 from 1941. old stuff and paper real brittle. i think will make a video of the process when i do t in a few weeks or so.
Wow I would have thought the speaker with the giant hole in it was not salvageable, and would have to be reconed. Cool trick to know.
I have just watched a pro replace all  paper part of the speaker ,and a new cone cover ,they show you how to do it ,or they said you could send it to them for refurbishing,just a thought
Can't you find some sort of a new replacement,I wouldn't want that piece of crap back in my radio.,I no you. can buy replacement speaker paper ,and cones etc.
Thanks for the great video on vintage speaker repair. I will try on my 1937 Fairbanks Morse floor radio 📻
"hey guys"  now that's original, where'd you ever come up with "hey guys" ???
dude that was coast to coast AM on the radio I used to listen to that all the time now I catch it on you tube I love all that conspiracy theory stuff. thanks for the speaker fixing tips the finished product looked great.
Nicely done! & thanks for sharing the tips!
Thanks so much dude. I've got an 18" Yamaha speaker, and long story short, the cone got decimated by a water balloon. I think I still have most of the torn parts. Hopefully I can save $140 with this.
Good technique
lottery tickets work good for big patches!!  trust me!
Have you ever seen a radio, etc, that had a speaker with that metal bell in the middle in a cabinet that had it front-firing instead of top-firing?... I was just thinking that maybe that bell is used in that configuration there in order to help disburse the sound more omni-directionally, since it is being projected upwards from the top of that tall cabinet... just a thought :-)
i did the same....Its good in a low volume  but if i max the volume..you can hear a broken sound...specially if your playing bass Music...
I'm just repairing a speaker and I've found a stencil brush (made for tapping, a 1" paint brush would suffice) is great for getting the coffee filter in the features of the surface. A screwdriver is good too, an old one with rounded edges on the blade. Great video!
man!!!!,this is the kind of videos I love to see,very well explained, and very helpful you just made me save big bucks,thanks alot!!!AMIGO!!
Haven't read all the comments, but using old drier fabric softener sheets also work very well. Just be sure they are used enough that the fabric softener is pretty much exhausted.  They have the toughness of fibers and work well with diluted glue.
What if the rubbery ring around the perimeter that sticks out  a bit is shredded? Any way to fix that?
Reparação perfeita. Bom trabalho....!!!
I found your  videos about the Westinghouse radio this speaker goes to...it's cool....also, Saran-wrap type plastic film would do nicely for the protection while transferring the cone ridges onto the coffee filter paper
copydex and rizla is what ive used on a 15" bass drivers!
interesting, you say the original had cotton fibers "like dollar bills" and you didn't have anything like that hanging around... did it occur to you to try using dollar bills?  has anyone tried this?
That speaker looked hopeless at first.  Nice restoration on a near impossible to find field coil speaker.
thx this helped me cuz i am making something and i have many old speakers that are broken so.. THX! :DDD
Amazing .. so informative!
Why don't you just buy nice new speakers, is it really worth the time and effor to fix up fucked speakers?
very cool
Nice tips.  Thanks.
Sweet!  I just finished restoring a 1951 Philco SB/FM/Phono and dropped a screwdriver end though the paper cone.  All the pieces remained, was just torn.  Glad I found this video.  Couldn't have imagined the repair could be this easy.
I use construction paper; it's easier to work with than coffee filter and it has the same  consistency.
Beautiful work, Bob
Thanks for this vid.  Watered down Tacky Glue works great.  I've revived many old speakers now, thanks to you!
Brilliant! Thanks.
USE BONDO!
Modern cones often don't fit vintage speakers.  Plus there's a chance of damaging the voice coil.
Isn't it best just to buy the whole cone
Cool, I'm glad I was able to help :)
It appears to only be available in the UK ?
Thanks for the help! I pasted some coffee filters on my speaker and it's repaired and looks good. I am awaiting parts for it...
A torn cone would cause the radio to sound terrible, but it would still work.   There are plenty of other of other items you need to check if you haven;t already.  Power transformer, electrolytic filter capacitors, paper capacitors, field coil or choke, etc.
Can a cone be the problem of a radio/phonograph not play??? The cone on my speaker looks even worse than yours. I am restoring an old Philco radio model 46-1201 code 125.
Coffee filters and plastic patching....never thought of that!! Thanks so much for all 4 of these great Restoration Tips Bob.... it is and was so cool.
GREAT! Just what I needed this morning. Repairing a speaker in a Grunow 1291 Teledial. Thanks much...
Awesome tips! I'm gonna try my first 15" speaker repair here in the next few days. It has a few tears on the cone, but nothing as bad as that one in the video. Luckily the foam is still completely intact. Glad I found your video!
Keep in mind I'm referring to antique speakers like the one at the end of this video.  It's from 1929.  They didn't use crossover networks, or permanent magnets or tuned enclosures.  You'll greatly diminish the value to collectors if you put a modern cone in there with a synthetic surround.  Some reconers go so far so to create new paper cones from scratch and use chamois leather for the surround.
Your not going to ruin the sound, theres guys rewinding there own coils all the time, its a wear item, like breaks on a car. your allowed to replace worn breaks no? so replace the cone the coil, the sound will IMPROVE. the quality of sound come from the speaker last and first speaker cabinet design, cross over design dampening material, how much, what kind etc even magnet strengths which degrades or time, yes you can recharge speaker magnets. Don't get myopically hung up on the cone and the coil
When it comes to antique, very hard to replace speakers, yes, I'd rather patch it than risk damaging the voice coil or ruin the "sound" of the speaker.
so its either an exact matched replacement cone or the nasty looking patch job?  Why not just use a new that is close enough to work?
sure, if you find me a paper cone with the same dimensions and leather surround that will sound the same.
just recone it
That's awesome!  Glad I could help.
Very helpful! Thank you very much!!! Thanks to you I fixed my old TV's speaker, whose buzzing has been irritating me for a long time, with just glue and a coffee filter!
Check out my last few videos on the Philco 15DX for more about speaker repair.  Good luck!
Excellent video Bob. I've been collecting and restoring vintage radios for over 45 years but I've never attempted speaker repairs other than minor ones. Now I can hardly wait to tackle my first speaker restoration as I have many in need of just that.  Thank you.
Thank you Bob for the info.. We have those merchants here also..  Best wishes
It's called Aleene's Original Tacky Glue and its available at many stores.  JoAnn Fabrics and Michael's Arts & Crafts carry it in my area.
Where can you buy the glue?  thank you for the upload it was very informative
speakerfreak95 has speakers like those
You're welcome.  I'm glad you got it working.
I used your tip for an old 1946 speaker, works Great!  THANK FOR POSTING
you should think about doing old school body work i bet u could work miracles with metal tape screen and bondo from walmart
I found some speakers on the side of the road The woofers looked like they were stabed with a knife many times so I used tissue to patch them but the patch you made was huge
This man is only 23.
Great tips, should have watched this before working on that RCA 100A I have, would have saved trial and error.
I have a RCA 17K with a speaker that has some damage but fixable by your methods, I think. The problem might it is sagging to one side from sitting there doing nothing for a long time. Will this be a problem or just fix the cracks and let it go as is? I haven't even tried to power it up, it's in really bad shape. Did you try the kies air with your new wireless system?
use tea bags? hehhehehehe
I would like to thank you for your speaker repair tips. I successfully repaired a pair of fisher audio three way speakers using your techniques, they sound great now.
Nice work and helpful tips buddy. Thanks ;)
Great. video, I'm getting ready to fix a 12 inch 1937 field coil speaker. This helps a lot. Thanks
@bandersentv could they burn out?cuz i like to listen to the music wery loud :)
My plug(speakers jack) fails,i have two subwoofers,one failed on left side and one failed on the right side,how do i fix it?now my two woofers have only 1 speakerjack left of each :( HELP!
@bandersentv     then  i guess it  should be ok .. i just  saw a bottle  of clear  tacky glue  in my mom's sewing desk  and i don't see much diference so i will give it  a try  and  see how  it  turns out ..  the only  thing that worries me  is that the material of  the cone seems to be  much harder that  the one  on the speaker  in your  video because  it's from a bass guitar  cab.. i don't know  if  the coffee filters  that  you are  using  on this video  will work  in my situation...

is there  a diference in using  the clear  tacky glue  instead  of  the one  that  you  are  using  in your  video ?? is  the clear  one suitable  for this  kind  of application ??
lol you said t bag
That is really cool!  Very nicely thought out.  I'll be using some coffee filter on some nice large cabinet speakers I got recently as a gift. 2x15 plus a mid and a tweeter in a 4 foot high box. Yum.
Nice job. Are you the janitor from scrubs? You sound like him. :P
you can laquer the conus as well to make it stronger
@bandersentv I will bet my head it will. It always does. unoticable to the ear but definitely shortening the lifespan of the speaker. IT must be a high quality driver if its kept that long
Hello! I have a 15 watt alnico speaker that I got off ebay with the same kind of huge hole .I will eventually have it reconed but I want to try this method and see if it will work okay first.Cool!
Yes that´s rigth but this is cool too. J collect very old radios that´s the reason why I ask. Do you know in which this "device" was????
Do you know how old this very old speaker is (that´s the first generation of speakers)
Person or whoever you want to be called. Listen if you paint the membrane wih this kind of paint it will definitely increase the xmax lowering the power of the cone. Anything to say to that?
Wow, that is freaking amazing jwhat you did with that speaker.  I love seeing you restore things insted of throwing them away :)  I used some Duco cement on the westinghouse speaker insted oif replacing it.  It turned out really nice too :)
Is that wood glue, i know if you mix that with water, you can do a similar thing, thanks for the vid, i have a set of old speakers, i would like to restore
@bandersentv  Thanks, i can't wait to get a damages cone to try and Fix it.
Wow, you just gave me a reason to not throw away speakers with holes.  I am going to try this next time. where did you get that glue?
I admire your ingenuity and perseverance, most modern day people would simply give up and dump the speaker. well done !!
Thanks you really help me. i have really old speaker and i trying to fix him
Oh no - this will not work - coffee filters??
Oh no!!
hey by the way  Is it possible to Connect to different speakers together? I mean I have the Right and left Speakers, but I dont have a subwoffer with the same brand of speakers. But i do have this other brand of subwoffer, but is it possible to connect it to the two speakers and still work properly?
okay I'm guessing they rip because they are old and because the music is loud. but once its ripped how do you know if its best to repair the speaker than to buy a new one?
Very nice and more simple than I expected.
Masterpiece...  I'll use this method to fix the cone on mine.. Thankfully there's no gaping holes like on the one you demented on... I'll get around to that one of these days....
Hi,   Thanks for this video, just tore a vintage celestion  g12 taking it out of its cab. Much appreciated !
Big help on this. Poked a hole in my Jackson TV speaker, found your post on VideoKarma and followed the link.  Thanks!!!
Good video but think it would just be way easer buying a new one.
Hi, what kind of Transformer is that? did you say Iso Tech?  Where can I get one? Can it be used all the time with an old radio?  I have a restored RCA 29K, Could I plug the radio into that sort of transformer so  I can run the radio at 110 volts? all the time?  Thanks
nice vid  I have used the same basic technique of PVA type white glue and patches -  I've never needed a real big section and thought your method of creating a new one from the existing come was  just great.  I also found on some old speakers with rubberised surrounds liquid latex glue "Copydex" brand in the UK is also useful  thanks for the upload - really enjoyed it
