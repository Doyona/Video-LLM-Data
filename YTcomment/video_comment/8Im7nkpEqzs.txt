What's in the filling? You just showed it already prepared stirring the ingredients then adding the butter.
I mean come on! 😆
Such a beautiful soul💕
I have to make these!
I just love Laura!! Thanks again!!
These look so good! Perfect autumn or winter dessert. In summer I like to do something vaguely similar with peaches on the barbeque. Cut them in half, remove the pit, sprinkle with brown sugar then grill on both sides, serve with either granola on top, a drizzle of honey or ice cream. Its delicious.
I don't innerstand how she stay fit
I made this the other day and it was soooooo good, but I used flax seed meal instead of almond flour because that was all I had lol. I didn't put any almonds either. It was so delicious I'm definitely going to make this again. So simple! Thank you!!😁
How many calories is this?
Mrs. Vitale, I just want to say you inspire me so much! 😍😫 You are part of the reason why I still strive to do my videos, I haven't done as much as you but I am trying to get all my stuff together so I can be consistent. Blessing to you and your family, and may God up above who sits on His Throne, bless you mightily in the days, months, and years to come. Amen! 🙌😊💕 Xoxoxo.
made this immediately after watching the video. didn't have any almond flour and almonds thought, so i just replaced them with oat flour and walnuts. it tasted great - crispy oats and the combination of soft warm apple and cool ice-cream was perfection!! loved it.
niceeee
are there any substitutions for the butter or is it essential? I try to use my butter sparingly in my baking because it's a little expensive where I live. Thank you to anyone who answers🙂
omg its sooo delicious yum
Looks awesome Laura... can't wait to try it😄
I love your videos and the food looks delicious 🤤
I mean come on ❤️
Look so yummy
Camoooooonnnnn!!! (:
Yummy 😋
Would that work with molasses or something like that ?!
I made these baked apples for the Jewish holiday, Rosh Hashanah, and they were a hit! I substituted coconut oil for the butter and it worked really well. Thanks so much for this AMAZING recipe! I'm probably going to make it again for the upcoming holidays too! 🙌😀❤️
Hello Laura, i not too long ago made this, it turned out great, tasted just like fried apples with the granola topping. Now, the only thing i guess I didn't do quite right was buttered my 9x13 dish enough (i thought i did) so, half way through, i had to add dollops of butter in the pan & place back in the oven the other 20mins. It taste so good. Thank you👍🏽😊
I don't bake desserts! Tried this and it was eye popping good!!!! Thank you Laura.
I did your recipe and I must say it is amazing, really nice but I didn't have ice-cream but only a single cream still wonderful, ingredients are healthy, thank you.
Did u just touch the pudding to your lips to test the heat. That was so sweet. New mummy. love your vids :)
I live across the water from Italy!  I just made this, and it is just incredible!  Thank you!
Hi, would love to have your recipe for your glazed turkey burgers
Laura, I just cooked them and that was the best part of my day. I have no words, for me, the best fall treat ever!!!!!
ammmazing
I made this tonight....AMAZING! Thank you for sharing 😘
As soon as Laura topped it with vanilla ice-cream and caramel sauce I was like (Yes! It looks so good!! I want some!!)
Every time I feel stressed out and just blah, I watch these kind of videos. Is it just me? It relaxes me and I find it totally satisfying 😌
3:25 Anakin Skywalker was just triggered by this.
Am I the only one who's grossed out by her leaving the stem area and that little shriveled thingy at the bottom of the apple?
can these be frozen?
oh man... more awesome fall foods! :O i love cooked apple desserts. And this one looks super easy to make. Going to need and try this asap. Thanks for sharing Laura!
Hi Laura! Twenty five years ago I had very good peperonata in Batibaglia - provincia Salerno. I'm curious if you know this dish and wow your grandma makes it. The one I had was made of bell peppers eggplant and potato.
Very nice, seems really good !
Thank u so much I made it yesterday bomb so great in every bite!
this does not last in my house .. gone in seconds .. :) props to me ..
Love your videos!! They've also inspired me to start a cooking channel with my mom! Hopefully one day we will have half the following you do! Keep up the amazing work!

Hi, do you have a recipe for fried ice cream?

I 'like' Laura's videos before the video even starts lol
Yummy!!! Looks so perfect... I love how u said "I'm going to destroy this bc I can" I say that all of the time when it comes to food 😂😂🙌🏼🙌🏼
I'm making it right now lol
Delicious! I love comfort and simple food, it remind me my childhood <3

This looks like the perfect thing for a rainy Friday evening.

Can't wait to make these!! And thank you for making these gluten free!!!
Laura, this looks absolutely delicious! I just wanted to ask, can I substitute coconut oil for butter?
You are the only person in the whole wide world that can make chewing sounds and I don't feel like smacking you ☺
I made these yesterday for a family dinner and they were great! Even with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top it was delicious but not too heavy.  Thank Laura!
Come On 😂😂😂, like a true Italian 4:53
Can I just use flour as I have a nut allergy
Oh my god! I am drooooooooling
autumn = apples and cinnamon <3 thanks for this recipe! I'll try it as soon as i find old fashioned oats
Common 😁😁😁😁😁
Sooo yummy! I love all ur recipes and I'll def try this
oh laura.....when u eat and taste the food....its amazing...
Love her! I think I figured out why she talks so fast sometimes it's hard to understand is because she's Italian and they do speak fast when they're speaking English. I saw a couple people asking the same thing why do you talk so fast I believe that's why. Wish I was Italian! PS you're beautiful Laura me and my family just love your recipes and get a kick out of watching you. You make all the recipes seem so easy peasy perfect :-)
Gotta have it !!!
Love these! Bet they would be nice with a cinnamon rum sauce that goes on bananas foster!! Mmmmmmm now i want apples
looks amazing!
Perfect recipe for a rainy day
I tried many of your recipes and they are always very tasty and delicious! Since you are using almond flour I'm thing of substituting the butter for coconut butter?! Let's see how it comes up😱
YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!! I LOVE THIS
This reminds me somehow of when my grandmother made a (French, I believe?) recipe where she baked cored apples filled with a homemade, thinner than usual, vanilla pudding topped off with some raisins.... The apples where also swimming in the dish of the same vanilla cream pudding. YUM. I also suspect sometimes she put a bit of liquor in there. Too bad I can't find the recipe anymore. :(
Laura you made my mouth water 😋
can't wait to make this!
What if you can do almonds, what other nuts would you suggests?
Looks amazing! Will have to give these a try :)
Looks delicious!  You're so funny.

Thanks, Laura. This looks delicious. I'm trying to get my elderly mother to watch cooking videos, and am definitely going to send her this one!
Can you use coconut oil instead of butter? Or is butter essential to this? I just have a milk allergy, so I'm just curious if i can substitute it here.
💚💚💚
YUM.
Omg Mia is sooo lucky with u laura, she will never go hungry 🤗
love you Laura soo much, #1 cook <3
Baked apples are the best 🍎
Cousin laura!!!!! You making my Sunday!!! I love apples. I wonder what kind of vanilla ice-cream she used?

Will this work with green apples? I think the sourness of the green apples will add another level of flavor.
Girl, you kill me, I love love love it!!!
Hi Laura, can you make something with Pineapples? Thanks
Looks amazing! Instead of apples, can this recipe be used on top of peaches as well?
