Hello. Just found this channel. I don't like eggplant. Can you suggest a substitute?
⚘️
i'm so hungry right now ...
I have just seen that burger recipe - Thank You - you are ‘marriage material’ ...& i am a straight girl  💐😘
Thanks a wonderful recipe Blessings to you
Looks delicious
For once a vegan burger without walnuts. I like them but we have allergies in family. This looks like a moist recipe; tasty.
How much protein?
This guy who plays the guitar sounds like someone knows only 2 keys.... Drove me crazy!!!! 😱😱😱
thanks a lot.. what can I use instead of oats ?  I wait for replying, thanks again
You are the truth! I'm so glad I found your page.
Can I use white chickpeas instead of black?  Thanks for the recipe.
Am I just hungry or does she just make it seem as though vegan food would actually taste good?   *side note, I'd chop up and use all of the stems from the cilantro to get all of that yummy flavor 😋
That looks great
Good morning .   Please accept my heartfelt thanks , congratulations & best wishes.   (I am a senior citizen. Old woman. Harbouring somewhat certain kind of prejudices regarding young generation.....my only  child says ...I am  somewhat ''dogmatic...'')  I had almost given up on life ....dejected ..while browsing  seeking catharsis by watching some old movie(s) stumbled upon your channel / video.  Trust me , you completely dispelled my gloom  reviving my zest for life once again.   Nutritionally , presentation wise  etc etc in every way you are the BEST.  You are so RELAXED . I have forwarded your video link to my son who is also in the same dilemma ...how to strike the right balance between good nutrition & vegetarian cooking.....he & his wife are growing organic vegetables selling them in Farmers' Market.   I am most certain your cooking would be a great inspiration to both of them.  Thank thank you thank you very much.
hello will this help you loss weight  ???????
Both times I've tried this I've been unable to blend the blender items.  Why?  Not enough moisture to blend.  So then I add extra moisture, it blends, but then the 'burgers' are crazy moist and don't hold together.  I turn them into 'meatloaf' patties that I freeze... which forces them to hang together.  I'm using canned chickpeas.  Is THAT the problem?
Hi This recipe is super!! I tried it without oil and it’s perfectly satisfying. Thank you, we’re looking forward to test your other recipes as there is a balance between tasty and healthy that suits us very well.
Nice. Thanks for the recipe!!! Did u make the mayo yourself too?
thank you so much for sharing
Hi Teenuja, Any replacement for egg plant😅
Love it!!
I'm floored...never heard of anything but the , yellow colored ones!!! Wow, live and learn! I'm gonna have to explore the new possibilities!!!
No chilies too spicy.
FREE THE GLULTEN'S  ! WHY DO I THINK SHE IS A DEME ? DOES IT MATTER ?
Consumer reports
Tanks
Love how it looks.  I will try it.  Why are your chickpeas brown?
Good morning.  Can I substitute with red kidney beans or black beans?  I do not have any chick peas in the house at the moment.
Very nice, I will try it sometime.
Is normal white chickpeas ok? I don’t think I’ve ever seen brown chickpeas.
Thank you darling xx
Your video was very relaxing, beautiful and inspiring.
Ya this looks good plus it looks simple to make and it doesn't look like they would fall apart like most you see" good work"...
I love your recipes! Thanks for posting!
Can we use white chickpeas???
Love this recipe, but can't stomach the spices cause of ulcers. Chick peas got a lot of GAS...beware.....might blow the roof off the house.
I love all the recpies I am going to make the burges with brown chick pease if I can buy them I will also try the mayo if I can get one of the ingreadients you mentioned lovely recpies for me a vigan thanks very much
This sounds and looks like just what I've been searching for -- many thanks, Teenujah (did I get that right? 😊).  In fact, your whole site does -- so glad I stumbled across it.  I look forward to exploring your recipes, and the adventure of vegan eating which I'm just beginning.  Many thanks, again!
Excellent, thanks for sharing
how long does it survive in the freezer
I try your recipe and I like version fried😋 thanks a lot👏
Can we freeze these?
Great recipe.  Thanks for posting.
Who has actually MADE these?  I see many comments on how good the burgers "Look" and many who say they will be making them; but, no reviews on them.  Please, if anyone tried these, would you leave your opinion on how they tasted to you. Thank you.
What could substitute the oatmeal? I would like to try grain-free.
Ymm
Beautiful and healthy! And the presentation is very professionally done! I will definitely try this recipe.
I’m sooooooooo in love with your channel. You are the best vlogger, honestly you good explained, it’s amazing.  I’ll start doing some of your recipes. Thousand thanks from Paris 🙌
😍
I just love watching your videos can’t wait to make this
Love this video
Can I use ordinary white chick peas for this recipe?
Excellent burger recipe but too much work, what a wonderful video
Wow, good recipe and the buns look amazing too!
Love your recipes and your videos! So peaceful, loving and nutritious!  Thank you💛  Is there a substitute for eggplant?
Great recipe but I don't like aubergines. Can you recommend a substitute or can I just leave it out? Thanks.
Why don't you go to master chef???
I just discovered you....looking forward to making some of your recipes!!!
The eggplant itself looks 😋😋 why cant fine paste for chickpeas?
Any idea for an oats substitute? I'm allergic to oats.
Can't wait to try these. They do look great.
Looks yummy,Thks for sharing,love n kisses
So awesome. Phenomenal
Brilliant!
Love the video thank you for sharing will be giving these a try🍒
what type of bread am I allowed to eat. I just recently become a vegan and I was curious if there is a sort of bread brand that vegans buy
I wouldn't make this recipe unless I could taste one first. Nice presentation, though.
These sound excellant. Will let you know how mine turn out!
very delicious and healthy recipes 😛
Thank you!
I love this recipe as much as I love your channel!!
Really love your videos, your pace, grace, music.... all great!! Thank you so much! 🌷💚
Hello i am glad to have found your channel... have you got a video for Mauritius Vegetable ACHARD pls? Thanks for your vegan recipes!
Veganlovlie , Nice recipe .
I love, love your recipes. Thank you. I have been enjoying a vegan lifestyle for only 2 months now so I  have much to learn. My health has improved so much, it's very exciting to realize food is my medicine. I now eat to live. Thank you for your help!
I just Love you!! thank yu. :-)
Nice recipe, will definitely try it out, keep going !
Looks yummy 😜
Very excited about this recipe. Can regular chickpeas be substituted?
Wow! Your food looks so healthy and delicious. Nice video. Thank you.
For the hoven version, car we freeze it ? What about the consistance and taste when cooking it?
I'm so happy I found this channel!!!
Ymmmm....homemade Veggie burgers, made of chickpeas and eggplant, fried 'til golden brown and crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside and eatened in homemade hamburger bun, and healthy buns at that! Thumbs up Veganlovlie, thanks for sharing and sendin' ya greetings from Mexico! :)
I can't thank you enough for this recipe. I tried out this burger today and it was delicious! I just made one change - used red beans and white chickpea instead of the brown ones.
So perfect and clean work👍
thank u for putting the recipe in the downbar. it is very annoying to have to click a link that takes u to a  long blog post complete w ads just to print a recipe
Amazing recipe! Thank you! Also, we don't have maple syrup here in Brazil, do you have a suggestion to replace it?
wow...not a whisker of yucky meat in sight and better for you then the meat versions
could i replace the chickpeas with black beans?
I love curry leaf. That's the nice thing about Toronto -- you can find all the ingredients here. Had never heard of kala channa, but am heading off to Ambal Trading to get some. Great recipe.
My mix came out do mushy and wet what do I do :/ !!
Can I substitute black beans for the brown/black chick peas and get the same results?  Thanks.
looks delicious!! i loved your calm way of presenting . will definitely try this recipe! :-)
are the chick peas cooked or just soaked????
Im a chef and want to say that your recipes are awesome:)
omgosh I can't wait to try these!
can i use red kidney beans instead ?
Rrr
Looks very good😊
Your chickpeas look so dark, are the roasted as oppose to boiled? Thank you
First of all, a big complimient to you! I really enjoy watching your videos and you can see that you make them with lots of love! I will definitely give these burgers  a try! Is it also possible to use chickpea flour instead of chickpeas?
Can I use lentiles instead of chekpeas ???
This looks heavenly! 😍
That looks so delicious, and maybe somebody has already asked, but can you tell me what BROWN chick peas are? I know the regular chickpea (or garbanzo) but have never heard of the brown version. Are they dried perhaps? Thank you.
I've already noted the ingredients. gonna buy wat i don't have at home tomorrow. will make them on friday!!!
amazing thanks sooo much for this, cant wait to try them
Your food speaks for itself. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us. 👍
can i substitute the chickpea with another pea/peanuts? or maybe red bean?
It looks amazing!
your recipes are wonderfull 😊
this is the tastiest looking burger i've seen in my life...
Any alternatives to chickpeas? I'm allergic ):
Could i peel the eggplant before u cook it?
Yum!
Hey sis, not 100% gluten-free, as I have unfortunately found out.  Soy sauce is almost always brewed with wheat :(  A good choice as an alternative would be Bragg's Liquid Aminos
Great recipe. I would fry the eggplant I think!! What else can you use instead of oats? I find it abhorrent 😊. Thank you!!
I strongly dislike eggplant.  What do you suggest for a substitute?
Dear Teenuja, which method  would you recommend more to preserve them? To freeze them before cooking or after?
How many burgers do you make with those ingredients?
Your Brilliant!!!💖💕Wow!!!  🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
They look absolutely scrumptious! I can see I will have to try making them, thank you for the vegan recipes :)
Ugh I would love to have a cup of tea with you and talk food.
Bwhats a safe non stick pan brand?
this made me sooo hungry! so trying this :3
Hi Veganlovlie! I thought your recipe video production (and the end result) looked fantastic. I want to try this recipe soon.  Thought you may like to know that the addition of soy sauce contains gluten! A good substitute may be tamari sauce or liquid aminos.  Aside from that, thanks for a very promising vegan burger!
That burger looks magical! Awesome burger! wish you could come over my house to help me lol!
These look delicious!  We are vegan and gluten free so this is a perfect patty to incorporate into our dinner routine.  Your photography and presentation are top notch, really.  Thanks for sharing your lovely recipes!
HOW are you this amazing?! :o
youre recipes are amazing 😍
I leave my hot wife for you and your cooking bb
I want to make a great veggie burger for my omnivore brother and I'm wondering if I could use black beans instead of kala chana (I could dry them a little in the oven if that's necessary)? Thank you very much for sharing this recipe, it looks amazing and I'm sure it's delicious too!
can you use white chickpeas instead?
I don't know how but I stumbled upon your page and I am in love. Your blog is amazing and so are your videos. Thank you so much for sharing! :)
+Sunyukta Au - I can't reply to you directly because of your google+ settings. If you are using the Chinese eggplant, the long and thin one, I recommend you soak it for about 10 - 15 minutes in salty water. But the globe eggplant or aubergine type does not need soaking, it's a lot less bitter. I'll try to think of some recipes with coconut flour. Thanks for commenting. :)
Hi Teenuja, nice recipe, gonna try this out tonight! I wanted to know if the bringals, once cut, have to be soaked in salty water? That's what my mom usually does. Thanks!  Would be great if you could suggest a few recipes which make use of coconut flour....salty and sweet? Thanks :)
not sure how i just found your channel but i am so glad I did!
this sounds great, but I am not from an area where curry leaves are avaliable... for what can I substitute them?
Looks delicious!
nice
Awesome work Veganlovlie! Here is what I came up with. They really look like BURGERS and taste even better! 8o).... http://s28.postimg.org/rf2q921vh/0717052233.jpg http://s11.postimg.org/e6g8evps3/0717052233a.jpg http://s27.postimg.org/55ygd8k2r/0717052257.jpg
Coriander makes me gag.. does anyone else feel tha way? I can't understand how everyone loves it and has to put it in everything...
Looks so delicious. I can't wait to try your recipe.
Wow that looks delicious! :O Can't wait to try it in the fall~ it's too hot right now lol and I LOVE the fact that they freeze well because I'm the type that likes to make a big batch. And yes!!! I was wondering if you bought those buns because they seem so soft! But I should have known! You awesome skills made them! Can't wait for that video~!!
burgers look really delicious, i think to try very soon... your recipes are just wonderful!!!!!
This is my favorite vegan cooking channel now. Your recipes are great!
I am in a personal quest for a great vegan burger. I will definitely try your recipe. BTW, loved your video, the editing and the way you explained how to prepare the burgers, it was very relaxed (I don't really like it when people rush in their vids, only my opinion). You have a great channel as well. Big hugs!
