Very interesting content on your channel… new friend here 😁❤️🍀👍
This is such a waste of time! You don't show the product you use, all we see is your hand, a brush and the wood...what a waste!!!
Name of the trees, please
You should post the products u use ... Beautiful work
I purchased spray on wood sealant. Would you say that it's better to do this instead?
Gotta be an odd thing to say to someone..  “honey im going to the store for a slice of wood , you want anything?”  “Yea babe pepperoni or bacon i dont care.”  “No hun im not eating pizza again this week why dont you get your lazy ass off the couch for 5 mins and thaw something out and do something usefull for a change, you can record thay damn football game, thats what we pay the 150$ a month for the godamn dvr so use it, ill be back later and dinner better be cooked!” (Slams door).   “Why she get a slice of pizza and i gotta cook dinner for her also?!?”     She gets back to two tv dinners on the table, “what the hell is this?”  “Thats what your fat ass gets leaving me out of pizza time and calling me lazy, you should be full with that slice you”  “fat!?!  You lazy good for nothing”.  “ the hell you have a slice of wood in a grocery,,,  ooooooh.....  shiiit...”.  —wife keeps bitching about everything he has ever done and he has to take it in order to get back on nookie level again in the next month...  but fucks that up when he interrupts, “ you know theres a stump out back and coulda used a saw and got that for free”. ...    then he remembers her asking for him to do that for her and telling her you would later after the game..  after eating pizza yesterday, and the day before...      Lol.
Nice video . you are good teacher
the children sounds are they a part of the video or did i get inference on the net i barely can hear this video
Not to be negative. But youre showing people wrong.its suppose to be long even strokes to make sure its even without access overlay or drips. Straight lines, even layers. Not sporadic  brush strokes........
The surface of wood is so smooth and without circles can you tell me plz how can i do my wood pieces smooth
What type of wood is that
Is it waterproof? if i use Shelack on like coasters and i want to throw them in the dishes or wipe them off will the Shelack keep the water/moisture out?
Mi
i have new rounds i just cut.  Can i add this to avoid cracking of the wood and possible bark falling off?
Thank you for the video!
