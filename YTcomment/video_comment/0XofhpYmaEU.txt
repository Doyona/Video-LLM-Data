What the hell are highway   markers
The monster bow penetrates less because the arrows are too soft for it and end up almost hitting the target sideways.
Can't believe it's been 10 years
rat-tail file... dumb name
I gave u 20 bucks once its crazy i found ur videos again
Who’s this handsome young man?
what else  i can use to replace the fiber glass rod any  other options???
hah he got showed up by a subscriber with a 45 pound recurve
now if i used 6 feet of pvc and had longer driveway markers how would that affect performance
recurve and arrows tutorial please?
Idk why I randomly thought about this video now I’m going to make this and see how much the price change 9 years later
What's the diameter of the fibreglass rods?
Just put thin pvc in the thick  one
Thanks for the very interesting video. Maybe the recurve penetrates farther because the arrow is going faster? I know that sounds obvious but an arrow's speed is a result of a continuous pressure against the nock by the string for a longer time.  A very high pull weight bow may only have a lot of pressure at the first moment of release and then not be able to move the string fast enough to maintain pressure against the nock. The total energy of the arrow is determined by how long the string can push the arrow and transfer energy. Imagine hitting a marble with a baseball bat, you will only be able to transfer energy for a very short time, compared to hitting a baseball.
Can i build the bow without pvs pipe only with fiber glass
Are the arrows fiber glass too?
Nice job brother, where do you get the fiber glass rods ?
what are the alternatives of Drivway markers?
Simpler_pay@old_soul_fbi @ZNA_PRODUCTIONS
making one tomorrow got all the supplies. i went dumpster diving.
it's faster than carving a bow😁
Thanks for the comparison- very interesting about the recurve
It doesn’t work I tried it it and I can’t get the string to say in the knocks and I made them deep
I tried making this box but l can't
How do i make an arrow and followup question, where do i get the fiberglass
This was cool and fun to watch.  I'm surprised how strong I am. An archery sub reddit told me a 35# longbow (that's been in the family for 70 years) is too high to start with. But it's easy.  I'm more afraid of hurting the bow while stringing it than I am about me. It's also really easy to draw.
Thanks your awesome 👍
Bro I came back to 8 years later to watch this again lol
Thats crazy!!
The title should say No measurements too! 😂
Oh you have hair here
Bro it's not what you think. Light bows goes good with light arrows and heavy bows with heavy arrows. Vise versa doesn't work.
ZedNoughtAlpha I remember you when youtube had just got started!!
Does the pvc need to be 5 ft or can it be longer or shorter
Making a pvc bow. Browsing YouTube for ideas. See this. Nice 💯
You don't need a heat gun to get it adequate bending temperature, a hair dryer or space heater will work just fine, granted it will take a little bit longer but it works fine.
Haha😂 I love the ending!
How thick is the paracord you use?
Does anyone have a link or anything where I could buy what hes using to make the bow in the video?
I can't remember the name of the channel I seen it on but I seen a video of a dude Heating a PVC pipe and making one very identical to that curved version when you heat it at high temperatures you can bend it around things and it will stay that shape
That recurve bow is gorgi!
What's the draw weight, sir?
You have that 10lbs bow but i have a 70lbs compound bow
That recurve bow is Bad Azz!!!   Definitely would LOVE to know how to make one!!
Alright this is a shot in the dark but I cannot get the notches straight to save my life I’ve been trying for the past two days and cannot get both ends to catch the notch and stay
Any guesses as to the durability?
how did you lose so much good hair in 8 years ?
paracord has a lot of stretch, so it's not the best choice, you lose a lot of power from excessive elasticity in the cord.
Ew he has hair 🤮
🙏😎🏆
A lot of modern bows with pulley's out perform higher draw weight bows because of the physics behind it. Kind of amazing. Crossbow still wins out though.
I made one years ago with 3/4” and got about 45lbs, the 1” bow I made I could pull maybe halfway I’d estimate 80lbs. I need to get back into archery I miss it
Still relevant 8y later ❤
These are recurve (reflex) bows. Developed by our ancestors, this is the Hun recurve bow. The bottom line is that it gives you much more thrust with a shorter draw than a long bow. Also, since we used it on horseback, it couldn't have been a huge bow. The other eastern peoples learned this form of bow from us, and the stirrup, without which you cannot shoot accurately from horseback while galloping, especially backwards. Today, a Hungarian archer can shoot at a distance of more than 1,000 meters with a bow he made using ancient techniques (except varnishing :), this is a world record. His name is József Mónus, USA, the state of Utah held the world record in 2023. Link:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBGfPo3hQW0
Ok, so.... link to the recurve you showed?
Dont warry about your monster bow just take more havier arrow for it and you will see its advantages. Nice job.
How reliable are the pvc bows are they bound to break quickly or do they last a while
Had the bow set up at a pro shop. It performed just fine https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxQEKUoxLWwayEDZR0NKB-5limn4MBU-2L . And I would say this is a good starting now that I could pass down to my son when he is older.But the package was missing the release and a nock was missing from one arrow.Dealing with customer support was terrible. They suggested I buy a new release rather than correct their own quality control issue because it’s to expensive for the. to ship it out from China.Update: manufacturer got back to me and resolved the issue. I retract the above statement.
Very nice video. Thank you.
Holy moly I forgot he had hair at one point
You need to include specifics like size of the Fibre glass rods...
“That penetrated almost exactly 3 and a half inches”  That’s big right? 5:15
recurve increases LB via spring tension. draw is less but power is better
bro im 10 and i made a 200 horse power AR with a sniper scope
Ight, this is going in my zombie survival crafting book
can you make these bows again
I made one just like this. I'm curious how you aim it and how to rectify that off-center riser.
How long your string is??
Where do I even get this stuff?? (UK wise)
Awesome stuff my dude! Keep up the fantastic work!
Recurve makes arrows fly faster and increases pound
You are correct on the recurve, they produce more power and speed than the same draw weight long bow,   And other suggestion for the difference though could be that the arrows were way underspined for a long bow of that weight and as such were striking the target on an angle which was sucking up some of the penetrating power of the arrow. Also as suggested by someone else, the long bow shots where hitting more to the side of the target making it move more also sucking up some of the penetration
what was the length on them driveway markers, looks like 4ft per?
How much is it's 🥰🥰🙏
he not bald!
Recurve's are also often used from horseback :)
Please read some hindu religious books they will help you
Its the spring factor . Power to spring. So if the construction has low spring capacity it wil not convert all power stored in the draw to spring back into place. In short more power doesnt mean more speed becouse of the spring capacity of the bow product.
Use a heavier arrow with the bigger bow it will penetrate deeper then
We used to do the same thing growing up ,this is what we used 1 half inch PVC pipe 1 3/4 inch PVC pipe put the half inch incide the 3/4 then cut notches about 1/4 of the way through the 3/4 inch. Then bend the pipe  using a person on ether side and a piece of steal suspension line ( single strand). The arrows we used duct tape for the fletching , aluminum tubing for the for the arrow shaft and take a file to the end get it as sharp as you can. You might not think this has much of a draw but if done right it has plenty. We took just about any thing we wanted to with them normally with the first shot. the tubing even works to bleed out the pray   faster in most cases
I just watch the walking dead 😅
Bro. U had hair???
TENHOPOBREMA
😂
extremely interesting.
I would like to see a video on how to make the recurve bow, which was sent by one of your subscribers.
what are those three green things?
Have you made one with spring steel rods instead of fiberglass?
A recurve bow delivers more power with less energy to pull because of more potential energy
This video is a classic, I get a lot of nostalgia from this
Can I use bamboo sticks instead of fiberglass rods? And i also wanted to know how to make/get that arrow. I loved your video very much
It's fun too see what you looked like 7 years ago!
That bow shoots damn well cuz
A bow with spindles at each end has more power because of the line running through it smoothly paired with the spindles adding more distance and ppsi
Them boxes don't compare to the rate of ppsi within measurement of puncture, try a giant frozen watermelon coated inside of a block made from jellos and glue mixed in then cut your mold of so it stands and the jello glue mix simulates the skin and the melon simulates the stomach torso
What type of string is that
Hey Eli or anyone else who sees this and made this bow, how do you keep the fibreglass rods from falling out? Duct Tape over the ends? But that would still let them slide down to the bottom of the lower limb. Thanks, hopefully you see this! I've got both string loops sanded into my pvc, just gotta tie the strings knots and put the fibreglass inside!
NICE!
I have no idea how someone can "not mind" having fiberglass splinters. It is one of the most torturous things imaginable 😂
Those arms though….
Step back 6ft and the arrow would go farther
To those interested in/discussing recurves in the comments:  A recurve is formally defined as a bow where the string touches the belly of the limbs. If the limbs are curved but don't touch the belly, it's considered to be reflexed or flipped-tips. If the limbs are straight, it's a longbow.  It's complicated, but recurves don't technically store more energy than a longbow, they just effectively shorten the working limb (unless they're working recurves, which unravel as the bow is drawn, but these are exceptionally rare and finnicky). A 10in piece of pipe is more difficult to bend than a 15in pipe, and thus bending both the same amount will store more energy. This is where most of the actual power increase comes from when you recurve a longbow: it increases draw weight, but the same effect can be produced by just shortening the longbow instead, or making the bow to a higher draw weight.   However, at a certain length of bow, the angle between the string and limb exceeds 90deg, and two things happen: First, the string risks flying off the bow Second, the string begins to pull the limbs *out* instead of down. This is called stacking, and it strains the bow without increasing arrow speed.   This is where recurves are handy: they make it so that the string angle never exceeds 90deg, allowing for more bend to be gotten out of a shorter bow. However, most materials will break at this level of deflection when made with reasonable dimensions, so it doesn't really add much benefit.  If you recurve a bow which is long enough to not exceed 90deg of string angle, then the only benefit you can possibly reap is having a higher early draw weight and a slightly lower late draw weight. This is because, when the string contacts the belly of the bow when braced, it's effectively a shorter bow and thus harder to draw. As you pull back the string, it lifts off of the limbs and becomes a longer bow and easier to draw. This effect increases with the length and intensity of the recurve, but the effect is normally not very prominent.  Recurves have several weaknesses, which personally compel me to make exclusively longbows: Firstly, they're harder to make  Secondly, and most importantly, they're usually heavy, and heavy in the wrong place. In order to stay bent without breaking (or flexing and losing their bend over time), they need more material than longbows. Mass near the tips of a bow is the worst place for it: imagine a swinging a baseball bat with a 2lb weight at the handle. Then imagine moving that weight to the tip. It now takes considerably more effort to swing. The same thing happens to a bow: it gets slower and less efficient, negating any effect of recurving.  Third, they're louder and have the potential to twist out of alignment. When you shoot the bow, the string returns to brace. On a recurve, that means slapping the bow, which is quite loud. The heavy tips also return home with more force, which leads to uncomfortable vibration and additional noise/wear on the bow. This energy is wasted, and doesn't go into the arrow.  A longbow made to a proper length (there are equations) will be faster, quieter, and more pleasant to shoot than a recurve.  tl;dr: Recurves aren't actually more powerful than a longbow. They just fool you into thinking so, and all of their benefits are negated by making a slightly better designed longbow. They can actually make your bow slower and more uncomfortable.
I think this video is a fake I have tried and listened to everything and did everything it says to do and it didn’t work
"That penetrated almost 3.5 inches" story of my life really
Nice video, next father son project for me :)
Are alternatives for the driveway marker material ?
How thick does the paracord need to be??
Easy, fast, perfect
Recurve bows store more energy making your draws more efficient this doesn't necessarily make it more powerful but your drawers are more consistent if I remember right you also get like a faster a shot   Basically adds more energy and speed for less effort
am i the only one having trouble tying the nots
Is there an alternative to Fiberglass Rods used in these bows?  I am unable to find them where I live in India; and the ones I saw online cost around $13 per rod.
De que material son las varillas yellows que introduces dentro of the pvc ? Thanks you 👍👍💪💪💪
Hi, what keeps the markers from shifting up or down in the PVC pipe ?
Gym too expensive
It's gonna be £45 now to make it
NOT boring at all.  The recurve bow is amazing considering it's relatively low draw weight.
https://youtu.be/m9Jjt-p6NKI
I'm impressed.  I certainly did not think that would work.  👍✌
Hey broh after 6 years of ur comment what ur doing now and how was ur finals
I followed all the steps but the three driveway markers won't fit into the pipe so I'm trying to put the two in and it won't fit with the duct tape on it
Used to do this all the time as a kid.
Does this still work in the current version?
it might be powerful but the accuracy is going to really suck. with no "riser" you wont hit shit. I would call this clickbait.
How does the fiberglass stay in there? Haven’t tried making it yet but I don’t like surprise failures that could be easily avoided
The curve on the bow helps the string to tense up more bringing more power to your shots the other bow the monster bow has no curves and only having the string to pull back more and smugging the power output
What kind of arrows are you using?
Lmao it's because it was hitting the wall
Any particular thickness of paracord?
I am going on vacation in 4 hours why am I learning how to make a bow
How much draw weight do you get if you don't use the fiberglass rods?
Very informative. You are a very articulate young man. I'm 70 but never to old to learn. You'd make a good teacher. I'll being trying to make the bow you built in this video!
what's the draw weight
of 2 cars with the same engine, the lighter one will move faster.
of course - a bow shoots itself, not only the arrow,. a physically heavy brow will transfer more energy in moving itself than moving the arrow.
*YES*
lol, I love this video and will totally make this tomorrow, but the cost listed in these kinds of videos always seem to assume I have most of these tools. I do not, not even the simple ones. I have a hammer, and screwdriver and measuring tape. That's about it 😂 I had to go out and buy that file as well as the saw as I had neither. Not out of my cost range by any chance, but definitely the minimum price and not the maximum. I dont even know why I'm talking about this at all except I guess I've had a glass or two and decided to ramble I suppose I think I have everything I need but the fiberglass rods. I'll have to find those tomorrow.
thanks
What is that yellow stick that you put in pvc
Me casually researching some school activities...  "How to make bow without powertools" This is interesting :0 (Makes the bow instead) :'D
Below is skipable nonsense trivia.  Considering in rpg discussions, people have claimed bows are strength weapons rather than dex. In this, I say it's both. Hunting bows for small game could be pulled by children so a 3lbs bow is viable too. But then you get the hulking mongolian bows with a draw strength of 300+ lbs meant for 300+ yards warfare. I'd like to suggest to users the difference between hunting bows and warbows as I'm s noob.  Hunting is dex. Warbows are strength meant for 10 by 10 rows with machine gun hit rate of shotgun spread across sniping distance. Both are great for their jobs.  Just some bs that's likely true people  argue that drags bows down.
Great! One question; what are the diameter of those inner fibreglass rods please? I'm trying to find some similar ones in the UK as we don't have anything like those here. Thanks.
the curved bow doesnt disperce the presserue on the full bow lenght, but then it has to be more solid in the center og the bow i gues. I like your bow thou! thanks for sharring :)
Very awkward release you got there, but otherwise a great video  Thanks for the cool idea!
The arrows be flying fast af
@ 3:57 n2it...dang...u mean u dont string the bow like how it was done @ the end of Predator....has rlly great flexing bend to it...
Video title “NO TOOL”…..”VIDEO STARTED….”for the tool….”
Can it kill people?
Thank you. What diameter of fiberglass that used at that bow?
The recurve has a more constant pulling motion do to its recurve shape
You will survive the Zombie Apocalypse 😅
Do not place the target near the entrance door
that was so informative and hilarious! thank you man!
Wow, impressive addition with the fiberglass inserts. Good stuff man, thanks.
How do you determine the arrow length for these?
6:19  it aint boring bro das why we watching, you do yo thang man, u lowkey got me hooked up too im curious on the difference
Thanks. Great idea!
Comin back 6 years later lol, havent watch ZNA vids in a while always a good time watching u bro
Woww its so good and so easy
With this bow you can kill a large animal, I think is powerful
I made a bow kinda like this and it came out amazing the problem is that i dont know how to make arrows
Whos this lil hairy lesbian?
Hi bro what is the purpose for the drive way marker? I dont i can find that in my country
75# longbow is no joke. My compound was drawing near 80# with its let-off. Shoulder DID NOT like it. Could get about 12-18 shots in before it hurt to much to continue.  Had it dialled down to 65# and that’s still well into hunting weight.
What size paracord did you use?
Does anyone know what size of paracord is the best for this?
Hey bro I wanted to know we're you found you markers, in a hardware store or online?
Robin hood be like, Yo this material is wierd.
I came here incase zombie apocalypse will happen in near future
why do you use gloves?
OMG IT looks so good i'll try it
What knot is that
What did you mean at 1:11? Can you not just make another notch on the other side that is 1 inch away from that side?
Will hollow fiberglass trellis rods work as well?, They don have those driveway markers here and I haven't found anyone selling fiberglass rods yet.
can you tell the name and brand for subscriber recursive bow and also the price.
can is go thrw flesh
Here i am it’s been five year since I first watched this vid and couldn’t make the bow because i was literally a kid but now.Now I’m going to make it❤️
Man I wish this dude would make me one I'd buy one of them sick
since PVC tubes of different gauges just slide inside one another smoothly and tightly, inspired by your fiber glass rods, I am thinking to combine thick and short tubes with longer and thinner ones, make a tapering shape.
Dude.  U really rock for this   Hat is tipped to you Sir. Blesses
I wanna make one
I used to just use 3 driveway makers. Next time Ill put pvc around it
Now u bald and look miserable
can you make an arrow with popsicle sticks
yes, you do need to use a heavier arrow even to get a decent percentage of power out of a higher poundage bow , if you do not use a heavier arrow the arrow will be launched without even soaking in a decent amount of power thus yielding a result similar to what you see here. The second reason why recurve bow performs better is because it was designed to, it is an upgrade on the longbow. So two similar bow with the same poundage but different designs may lead to recurve bow performing better.
The point of bow construction is to make an arrow fly fast.  A heavy draw weight does not guarantee speed, it just means you can shoot a heavy arrow.  Expert bow makers fine tune their bows to snap back quickly, resulting in higher arrow velocity.
3:12 nobody gonna mention how he nailed that bullseye without taking the time to aim?
Ingenious ! It's almost like an inside-out Bundle Bow !
You should hit that with a heat gun or something not a tool, like stovetop heat.  You could mould it very nicely, is that something you could do?
Which string did he used can anyone tell me i am gonna make it
😋🏹
I subbed.  That was 🔥where do u get your arm wrap?
I have bamboo so I'll use that
The past where he just goes "make a loop" and then jump cuts has some very "Step 1. Draw a circle. Step 2. Draw the rest of the fucking owl" energy.
8.1m people want to learn to make bow... interesting
Question: Couldn't you just put another pvc pipe with a smaller diameter inside this pvc pipe instead of cutting up all those highway markers?
Awww dude, I've known about his video on this for years, and I'm poking around his old videos for some other ideas. And here you are basically presenting one of Backyard Bowyer's designs. I like your stuff but I'm not going to stick around to watch something I already know. But hey, this comment for the algorithm kept me typing long enough to count as a complete view!
A bow is two levers (the limbs). Static (stiff) or working (flexible) ends are more efficient ways of pulling (bending) those levers. the distance records for flight archery are longer for recurve bows than longbows. the Manchu bow shoots heavy arrows faster, and the Turkish bow light arrows farther, than a longbow.
Dude where do i get arrow for this??
How long this PVC bow lasts? Have soon the pipe will degrade and will become useless?
Can you put the fiberglass rods all the way through?
I'm planning to make this but I don't have the driveway marker fiberglass rod thingy. Can I use Bamboo sticks? i have lots of them
The recurve bow is basically for velocity with less draw weight and straining your energy😃😃
Thanks this tutorial helped out anyways time to enchant it with power 5
can someone give me links to these items
Nice. 💎
Nice.. I'm now going for 1 1/4..  PVC.. Schedule 80... First try at it .
Where  can I buy fiberglass highway markers?
Damn my favorite pvc bow channel is a knife making channel
Was thinking about this exact video and was like yeah that sounds like a good 1 day first video that popped up when i looked up the channel. Nice
Is there any alternative for the yellow drive way marker?  We don't have that in my country
These things have some hella recoil
Never use paracord as a bow string it sucks when compared to twine, braided fishing line or bow string. paracord is to stretches to much. video for proof, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU6LLRN-BGw
Measurements for pip and fiber glass rod???
What is the gauge of the paracord?
5:14 hehehehehe
Can u make blow darts.
Ayo this guy has good aim
Does anyone know if we can use 20mm pvc instead 3/4 inch
What alternative can be used in place of the driveway markers?
Dont look at me like that i just want to teach my kid to survive corona
what are this stiks
Pretty badass my friend.
What do you use to make the tail of your arrows and to rest it on the rope?
The guy at the end borrowing a lighter 😂
Hi there, My 11 yo son wants me to point out that when you used the biggest bow it appears that you didn’t grasp the bow in the exact middle. He has an eye for detail but alas is incredibly dyslexic. But he watched the video twice….so that says something.   However I also want to say that you have done a great video and we are heading off to the workshop to build your bow. And paint it up to look medieval for a Book Week cosplay parade. Let’s see how we can power it down a few notches though!  I do remember myself as a 11 year old making my own arrows and bow to go duck hunting in a rubber dinghy on a winter marsh (This was before the interweb and the library was probably the only place you could get info anyhow. And experimentation was 95% of the amassed learning).  Never were any ducks ever safer….. from the woeful arrows I made from reed and weighted with fencing wire wrapped around the shaft to the shockingly inept bow, every one of those ducks must have died from old age and boredom because I never bothered a single one! Oh, and I paddled out at night so I couldn’t see a damn thing either!   But what an adventure……!
what are those yellow fiberglass things ?
Hi god bless have a good one
I made this and it actually fucking works.  Just one tip when your bending the bow to attach the Paracord take the fiberglass out first and then attach. And the bow will have a bend in it from the begining
This guy is really osmmm......simple and neat and clear and easy explaination👌👌👌👌👌👌 Most underrated Channel....must Subscribe....Thank you bro
Can you please write in detail what we need to make this
Thats cool
Well done
Well done
my loop won't stay put in the notches. anybody have any pro-tips to help me out?  it's driving me crazy
Got a stick I found and it’s perfect for a bow but I need to soak it to make it more denser do you know how long I put it in the water for?
Am watching now from India on bed 😂
What size is the pvc you used?
What kind of cord
well back in my day
5:25 how call of duty being sniped at sound was made
Now i can practice like lars Andersen
Excellent vid bro, exactly what I was looking for.. thanks 👌👍🎯💪
should have put the items in the description dude
I long are the driveway markers
And how on earth would I make a stick sight for one of these iv got an idea but using match sticks may not be so good
Right thats it I'm going wild west with the hunting next year will have to get to the hardwear store to get some supplys, might cos me a lil extra as  want to give it a custom paint job "woopwoop here I Go again"
Tried to make this bow w I thought any heat, my fingers and the materials both became frozen solid immediately and shattered. Would not recommend.
I just make it but it fail. The bow not go straight. Idk what the problem is. Any?
Could you plz send me the links to buy these things so I can build it plz
Steal this bow. PVC pipe from construction site. Highway markers from the local highway. Paracord from neighbour's clothes line. Next thing...get creative in procuring arrows.
This videos a classic
The heavy bow was penetrating less because of the arrow weight. It has a maximum speed it can reach and a max weight of arrow that can reach that speed. Heavier arrow with the heavy bow would penetrate deeper.
Lol he has hair
Yes, the recurve tips are for improved performance at lower weights.   The heavier bow would perform better at full draw though. The force increases more steeply the further you draw. The most power per inch comes from the last inch of draw
What string did u use for ur bow i made a working compound bow but cant find a cheap type of bow string
Recurve bows are built to act like a spring. You probably already looked it up, or someone else probably told you, but just in case, thats why
This guy is awesome
I just made one and found your vid after. This gonna come in handy for the zombie apocalypse
How much of the fibreglass would I need for a 20-25 lb draw?
Use mask when cutting fiber glass it can cause bad injury's in lungs.
i got these really long fiber glass things ment for fencing up an plot of lnaf will those work
I can't stop watching this
just a question: do you put styrofoam in your targets or is it just the box itself. thanks!
You call 15 bucks cheap. I got a bow and a compound bow with arrows for 8 bucks at a yard sale.
I love this I'm gonna make this
can we use something else instead of the driveway markers
No
What can I use instead of the Fiberglass rods? Can't find them here in Mexico.
is there any alternative for drive way  markers? Please suggest.
Thanks! Now I can protect myself against the fa who come and shoot tear gas rubber bullets at my friends
When you die as we ALL will soon. 99.9 sooner than they think 🤔 ..you will knell before JESUS. The One and only true Son of GOD Almighty, all others are false..Choose this day whom you'll serve. For if you don't it will be chosen for you and that is HELL  Arguing with me is silly at best. Bc I'm just the messenger....
Can we use anything else instead of that fiber glass rods🙄?????
How strong should a bow be in order to be able to hunt deers?
Sorry paracord stretched to much for a bow string
What if I want to make one and fiber glass rode or whatever it is not available around my neighborhood
With the way the world is going, we're all gonna need this
Hay vậy
Is there drive way markers in the recurve bow?
Fiberglass driveway markers?!?!?
Recurve bow please, looks sweet
Dog hunting           Jk
I love bow and arrow🏹 so much please do more  videos like this one
That's honestly impressive man good job on the video.
"No idea what the heck is going on here"??? It's called a rain shower.
Love from india
Amazinggg
That's how its like in Ohio
Hi, what is the link for the video where you used power tools please?
I am watching this after 6 year and i am watching for zombie apocalyspe
This guy is teaching proper useful knowledge for free, mad respect to you wise one.
now hows you get the arrows
It's a pity I can't find these damn markers anywhere
I need this
Nice bhai acha h
oh there's that guy he is
i was 12 when this came out dude. now i’m a year away from 18. what the fuck is time and how is it going by this fast
Sometimes, I wonder what English longbowmen would think of bows like this.

Useful video.
The recurve bow shoots the arrows faster and more powerful than selfbow because it transfers more energy to the arrow.
I remember seeing this video years ago.  Some more of your vids popped up in my news feed. Love em. You got yourself a new subscriber
Youve already had plenty enough bow and arrow experience this video is great
Roy harper?
00:23 paracord
This is Legal?
You have no idea this video will gonna save 54 millions lives in myanmar .  The Democracy revolution has begun now .  Civilian bow & arrow Vs Military Coup Guns .
what can I use instead of fiberglass?
wait....that's it? really? its that easy? holy shit lol.
This video introduced me to your channel. I like this video
Thought the title was just saying the bow had no power
Who else here after reading rangers apprentice battle for skandia
question what do you sue for arrows
How do you make that String
The recurve allows you to shoot with more power than you use to draw.
sir how can you kept this video on top of the google and youtube search
is fiberglass stick same with fiber fishing rod?
American: It's literally 90 degrees outside...  European: _chuckles_ I'm in danger
Thanks you showing me a way.Now I'm gonna make a bow at home to defend the military that starts a coup and kill the innocent people at night for no reason
Did it work
Paracord... You can give me link for this material?
Short answer, yes recurve bows have more power despite the lower poundage. It’s why they were favored by cavalry archers, they could have a smaller bow but not lose the power of the larger longbow a foot archer would use. On a side note it’s also why the only bow I own is a recurve.
Great video! I'm from New Orleans but now live in Ghana.   I have my PVC pipe, may have to order the fiber glass rods and para cord from US. May take me a little time but I will make one for me and my son to learn archery. Thanks again!
I’m 77 y/o and I learned a lot from your vlogs.  Thanks for posting and sharing with us.  I truly like your bows, gives me an excuse to not just throw away my pvc scraps.  I’ve subscribed and gave you a high five.
This was so cool. I came here to see a zombie apocalypse survival weapon but ended up fascinat ed by the draw strength comparison.
When it is raining but the sun is shining (i.e. not covered by clouds), it is said that the Devil is beating his wife.
if you follow the writing on the pvc you can make sure it's in line
good jobbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
I always wanted to try archery. I shall begin.
My dad made me one. He midified it a little so we can make it smaller to transport.
Kingdom come deliverance
Planning to make one but  couldn't find any of this "driveway markers" in town, will fiberglass camping tent pole will work?? or any good alternative?? TIA!
What are yellow things?
I can't get the fiberglass highway markers in the Netherlands. Does anyone know what I can use instead?
Oh heck, it's so nice to see baby Eli LOL much love dude, also deep-diving some old videos because it's always nice to see these old instructional ones
did you ever  make the recurve bow?
You deserve your hits :)
nobody talking about how his arm looks like a strong noodle???!
This isnt make slide right or left? Like a ricoset of the bow like?
Could i set up a bow like this for bowfishig?
You are a legend. Keep up the amazing work, man!
Do you have to have the driveway markers
And so the Mongols archery began
The recurves on a recurve bow make the arrow shoot faster
Where can I find fiberglass markes I can't find them anywhere under 50 dollars
Can someone give me a list on what it is I need?
You are cool
Centre of the bow is torque the top curve is speed .....So stand still and throw a ball or run and throw a ball you no the distance in speed and distance .
Ahhaha when I was 6 to 9 I used to live in Nepali I had big house and a farm and garden I used to make bow and killl birds and other stuff sometimes I even used to do battle with my friend but now I live in Hong Kong bug my grand ma and grand pa still lives in Nepal I miss those ALLL days with bow hunting
💗😮😮
I made this bow last night and it's working well and holding up so far. Awesome job on this!
how do you make that knot he used?
I miss you Eli
Just made one of these things. took me a while to figure out how to tie the bow knot and how to get the string to be the right length, but it was well worth the effort. thanks for the tutorial!
How do you aim?
I think it work like a bell curve, the draw back weight and shooting power is linearly proportional until it reaches a plateau, then decreases as the draw back getting heavier.
Good evening... Where to buy Fiber glass?
i actully di the research recurves are faster for there draw weight as is compound bows...... a kid can hunt deer with like a 25lb compound bow and it pull as much killing power as a 40+lb  long bow  recurves are not that drastic of a powercreep BUT  you can easily add 5ft per secon in speed just to be a recurve   sometimes more
Recurve bow of the mongols is more effective than english long biw
pretty strong improvised bow
Does anyone know a substitute for the highway markers? I can't get those in the Netherlands. :(
Question I hope you respond to this but do you recommend the fibreglass for a cosplay bow or would it be fine without it?
guys. it's 2021. make it before it's too late.
I made the bow. I don't shoot it that often, and it's already losing its poundage. Just expect it to get weaker as it get older.
His voice is like Tiger Shroff
Thank you!
Good to know for a Zombie Apocalypse 😅
What is the yellow thing?
It’s because the 1 inch pvc bow is heavier if it was lighter then the SnapBack when released would be quicker
Preparing skills for the apocalypse............................................................................ process complete
I saw someone make something similar with two pieces of PVC, one stuck inside the other
genial
I miss this Eli
One hella triceps
When you live in florida
Quick tip to anyone attempting this, do not use gorilla tape, it's too thick and won't allow you to slide the rods through the PVC
Wow just wow.
The recurve rebounds back to default position, straightening the string and launching the arrow better.
Watch my video please https://youtu.be/WqLeSHJxjjA
Damn, the heaviest is the lower end of egnlish longbows. That's powerful.
Its not boring
Awesome great skills
I made this and took it to my school for an science experiment :)
FUCK you u autistic Fuck ur dumbass tutorial doesnt fucking work
Holy cow He really did look like a lesbian
If someone with COVID wants into my house I can build a bow now and defend myself.
Does it hurt to cut the notch into the hollow portion of the pipe to accommodate thicker strings? Or possibly drill hole to feed string through?
Has anyone ever done a similar vid but for arrows?
Anyone know what size paracord?
Don’t mind me I’m just preparing for 2021 zombie apocalypse
I made a mini crossbow, does that count?
With a recurve bow if you know the draw and it’s let’s say 20 pounds than it will shoot the arrow at around 40-45 pounds because the recurve (the little backwards curve on the ends) will add more power
🗣️He's Ready!👀 Awesome BOW, and this is better than a Gun in my Opinion🤷🏾
recurve bows do actually shoot a faster arrow because the tips provide more leverage
How much for the curve bow I’ll pay lodes
recurve bow is faster
Combien en euros
Can you make a video of diy bazooka on your next video. I need to demolish some guys house. Ty.
I made this bow and measured it at 25 lb draw weight. If you cut the pvc to 4.5 feet it went up to 40 lb.
I hope I don't get arrested because this is illegal in my country
Wait would this be ok for hunting? Probably not but just wondering
Indeed, very good bow.. Well done bro👍
To answer your question on the recurve vs the monster bow is that the arrow is too weak and light for the 70+ pounds and absorbs most of the energy driving it forward, a stiffer and heavier arrow would be better for heavier poundage bows
recurve bow is an advanced version of a strait bow. that is why it is more effective than the strait one.
maybe someone said it already... but your targets should be fixed in place. the more the boxed moved after shooting the less would penetrate.  gerat work anyway
What arrows you use?
Hello, may i know how long should i prepare for the pvc?
Great video! I'm going to make one tonight! Super simple design and like you said pretty powerful. Thanks. Another fun fall project!
Was wondering if I could get some more details. I bought everything but the pvc pipe is like WAY too stiff to want to bend.   I also can't fire the bow at all. It's like the cord is too tight, the pvc doesn't bend any further and actually developed a dent in center
I can easily make this bow but I fear it is so lethal someone could end up dead. Someone have any ideas of things to throw for fun? No Nerf guns or darts please.
Здесь есть кто на русском говорит, обьясните какие материалы он использует ?
Great video man.
bro this is a goodyyyyyyyyyy
What size paracord?
Absolutely love the transparency and honesty. That is what makes this video so awesome. You are willing to admit you do not know something and research it instead of making up lies and garbage. Great for you and I look forward to more videos.
I did the math. The arrows were moving at 41fps.  We know that the string is 54 inches long because the distance between the notches was 58 inches(5 feet mines an inch on either end) and the string was 4 inches short of the second notch. using a frame where he had the bow at full draw, I calculated that the arrows were 32 inches long and it took 2 frames to travel its own length, so in .0667 seconds it travel 1.6 feet, giving us a final velocity of 41fps.
There's a lot more that goes into archery tuning your bow tuning your arrows, knock tuning, even your Fletchings, & rest rest. Tuning arrows for self made bows Is really important.  Just because your getting what you think is more power doesn't mean s*** is that arrow was coming off sideways. Case in point the recurve shot those lighter arrows better Because it's a weaker bow shooting very weak spined arrows. It's dangerous shooting weak spined arrows with high poundage Bows.  That doesn't matter if it's a longbow, recurve, horse bow compound, Or cross bow.
So does anyone know how he did the loop because i really want to know
I need this for fight with coronavirus
This could make a good crossbow if your interested, realy helpful bud bro thx
Rope name?

How to make bow rope full video
Con esto ya puedo visitar a los que han fallado a mi ciudad?
I was 14 when this video came out. My freshman year started 20 days after it was uploaded. I feel so old.
so much talk ... I noticed that it is characteristic of Americans to talk and that unfortunately makes their posts so boring ... 😕
Couldn't find those fiberglass highway markers for sale in my country so I bought them on Alibaba. Downside: minimum order 50 pieces. Upside: I'll soon have 16 longbows and can start my own PVC longbowmen squad.
The recurve bow  accelerates the arrow until all the tension is off of it while the simple bow has it's highest acceleration of the arrow just after release at full draw.  My Brother and Mother used simple bows for years though I found one old plexiglass recurve that we always thought had the tips made wrong to attach a string until i bought  a 65# recurve bow  in 6th grade with $ I made bailing hay that summer and realized the tips were facing the wrong way on the old one I found because it bends the other direction from the simple or common bow ( came across this video looking for the right name for a simple bow as before I bought the good laminated recurve  I thought the only other kind of bow there was, was a crossbow, as the compound bow hadn't been invented or at least in common use in the late 60's).
Those squirrels will pay
Old videos are so much better, not a time lapse video w begging for money all the time
A recurve bow is more efficient (and generally smaller) it's just more unpleasant to shoot due to the stack, and it's generally less accurate because any error in your shooting form will result in a much greater error. If you want to know all about how bows work check out the Traditional Bowyers Bible books 1-4.
Awesome video!!! Thanks!
I know a so much easier way
all you need is a string and a big straight stick that you can make a bow form with without it cracks, and a saw or a dagger
Ah yes, my first ZNA video. Don't take this wrong way, but you've improved immensely over the last few years. So glad I stuck around.
No one :  Quiet kid at home
First time I see a PVC bow lol. Very nice but I was wondering, is the bow losing power after some time? Is it noticable?
U r osm
Hi what’s the diameter on the fibreglass rods and what’s their length?
What is the string name I also want. That string
Is there another way to not use fiber
Silly question, what’s the uk version of a drive way marker?

Well your not the only one who's confused I'm watching this and I should be working and the fact that I have zero archery skills.
i keep thinking to myself: this cant be this easy., bu then iremember humanity has made bows from probably berfore they knew how to make fire
What are the materials again?
Thanks for the awesome video
It's gonna cost me 0$ when I will make it during Apocalypse 😂😂
Can you tell name of thread used I can't understand the English nicely
Can we make like wooden stick?
Me wanting a wooden bow be like: 👁️👄👁️
Watched this video for the first time when it came out and 5. Years later I’m finally gonna make one FYI the reason I was 15 and my mom said no 😂
Made the bow burned my self many times fixing the paracord so it dosent fray, my fingers hurt 🤣 but the bow is very impressive
Based on the arrow flight and how easy it appears to pull the string. This doesn't seem to be more than a 30lb bow. Which I wouldn't use for hunting as a disclaimer.

Amazing!
You Make  It Those Arrows?
I tried this with the 3/4" pipe and I'm a martial artist and I can't pull it back all the way. Granted, I'm a novice with bow, but just on strength I'm guessing the draw weight can vary depending on the PVC used and the rods inside. In fact, I was barely able to bend it to string it. How does it hold up to spray paint?
Niceو thank u bro  This will benefit me a lot

In case anyone is watching this in 2020 and wants a paper explaining why his heavy draw bow didn't go as deep, have a link. Short version is, simple bows like that get most of their force from the end of the draw, so if you're a little short you're losing dozens of pounds of draw force.   https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://sites.google.com/site/technicalarchery/technical-discussions-1/understanding-the-bow-draw-curve&ved=2ahUKEwjlh5mVrpnqAhXUWc0KHcoRC_4QFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw0tMIznEJfZVbea50vZI71C&cshid=1592964458641

Nah, Recurve bows are known for their power and mainly used by cavalry archers. Their meant for mid range and close range targets from horseback.

This bow is amazing! I recently went to Lowe's and picked up the materials which added up to about $6.50-7.00 and this bow is surprising! In 20 minutes I made it, and the hardest part of the build was getting the string the right size. Now I can hit a rabbit size target consistently from about 70 feet through many large tree branches here in Alaska! Very accurate, just wear gloves when shooting or the arrows fletchlings will slice your hand as I found out the hard way😅. Be careful and Happy Hunting!!!!!!!!🏹🏹🏹🏹🏹

How long is one driveway marker? And what diameter?
That’s some Texas style weather there
Make videos for making arrows too.
Fuck you bitsh
Thanks man
PVC and fiber glass, that's cheating mate, it's all shaped and sized for you already, should make a video where you find a stick in a park or something and show us what to do from there
Just to let you know about the recurve bow. The one aspect of a recurve bow is that you have a more steady tension load throughout the entire draw. For instance, while the bow is sitting static you could have 35 pounds and at full draw you could have 45 pounds so roughly there would be a 40 pound exerted pressure on the arrow from when it is released, at your grip, until the arrow separates from the cord.  More importantly, you are at 35 pounds of pressure against the arrow when it leaves the cord.  A long bow starts at 20 pounds and will pull back at full draw to about 80 pounds.  Unfortunately, the average is not adding both and dividing by 2 because most of the draw weight at 80 pounds is in the last 2" of draw. So you start with 80 pounds of acceleration pressure against the arrow and then it decreases rapidly. Having this deceleration of acceleration causes the overall performance of the arrow to not penetrate as well. The best way to test is not into a target but to test the Feet/Second the arrow is traveling.   First side note,  Drawing back a recurve at 45 pounds, a person will normally have a full draw. As opposed to a 3/4 or 7/8, shaky arm draw, due to the fact that it is easier to pull back a full draw on the 45 pound recurve than it is on the 80 pound longbow.  Second side note, it seemed that the recurve hit more centered on to the target not moving the target as much.  This would be like catching a baseball stiff armed as opposed to using your elbow for recoil cushioning. The ball won't bruise your hand  And, the arrow won't penetrate as far into the target.The longbow seem to move the target because it was hit off center.  My suggestion to correct for this, put the target against a solid backstop.  I hope this helps.
If you want a good bow, buy a good bow from a archery shop and get a person that works there to help you. Please don’t make a bow like this if u want a good bow. 😀
How can i make the pvc bow 80 pounds of pressure if i wanted to put a little more pressure to the pvc bow?
I have a bow
aimbot xD
yep show us how to make the bow
where did you get the yellow fiberglass hwy markers?
do we need a special kind of arrows
What have you put in side the bow?
It's the tips I think.  Thinner ends makes for faster release which is why long bows taper off at both points
Is it not 3 stick and 3 strings?
Recurve on that bow act as a leverage on the cord at end of the retraction of the bow,which increasing the power of the chord as it finishes the push to the arrow.its an ancient india bow design
Made 4 years later and YouTube recommended me this and I dont regret clicking
When he pulls the bows the arm that's holding bow looks broken
Just like the'res some bloopers at the end and I just love it by the way  I have made a bow with pvc but without fiber glass Thanks!!
Hello,nice vid.Can you please make a list of the materials you used?thanks
Recurve bows have been used 5000 years ago in indian history of mahabharat times. Even more than that ramayan times have been showed using recurve bows. its abosolute topic to do reseaech on why recurve bows pulls more power

What kind of rope is that please answer
That's what I'm talking about awesome
its very hard to find that pvc anyone have a link?
How long do the driveway markers need to be?
Not boring at all great video!
It’s the curve at the ends that help it shoot harder without it being so hard to pull back
the 75 lbs bow didn;t penetrate so deep as expected because you didnt pull the bow at the center.
you didnt hurt your hand in the testfire?! expected you will need the usually Archer-Handprotect (bad english sorry) Very nice Video! :)
What're the needs raw materials name? Is that PVC pipe? What you put materials inside in 2.18? Nice work. Thanks for sharing!
He was so young lol
Quarantine got me so bored Im gonna go make a bow :)
😽😼😼
Yes recurve is a more powerful bow, it allows to make a shorter bow more powerful.
you have to write the tools in description because i couldn't recognize the length and the size of the pipe you used
turkish bows can shoot like 800 metres away so....  it puts shame to famous huge english long bows.

Already made mine but thought I'd come back. Gots ta get ready for when Corona causes the apocalypse
What you have inserted in the pvc
Aila tiger shroff
Recurve bow a gift from India....
i'm honestly impressed by this guys archery skills
Its simple like  spearfishing .. the more powerfull bands you put the more heavier shaft you put for more penetration . So for the 75 pounds bow you  have you have to put heavier arrow !
Late response and by now you probably already know this but the reason re-curve bows (and the most modern answer to the issue compound bows) exist, is to get more bang for buck. higher force is not the only factor velocity of the arrow. how long and when you apply the force matter just as much. Your pvc "longbow like" bow applies a lot of force in the beginning but looses force quicker so the final velocity is a little less probably than that of the re-curve. Compound Bows are generally even more efficient than re-curve.
Awesome brother. Thanks can you please advise on the pvc length, general length and girth dimensions etc.
This guy looks like a 20 something John Connor and.... hes making survival videos. I can hear the Terminator 2 music in the background.

In ancient India, from thousands of years, the curl bow was the default bow. Infact when I first saw other kind of bows, I thought..oh that's looks nice, maybe it's better. This video solidifies my belief that ancient Indians were way too advanced, not talking about just bow now.
this child got guns
Can anyone tell me which string did he use , will drawstring work
I’m bingeing all your videos again when the apocalypse hits
what was that guy at the end trying to do?
Do you know how he made the recurve
This is a great tutorial!  I will definitely be using it in the future.  I do have a question though.  I don't know if it's mentioned in the video, but what is the size of the driveway markers he's using?
Great info brother ।.... 🙏🏻
No
Can be real handy now days
youre so fucking buff what the fucc
Good morning, I followed with extreme interest the tutorial and noticed that you use an arrow release system like the one used for compound arcs. But I couldn't see if the "D" loop is on the rope Could you please explain to me how to use this system on a normal bow?
If anyone can answer this, it would be awesome: Here I only found fiberglass rods that have half the diameter. Do you think it will be ok to use them, if I use twice or more of them? (I know a circle with half the diameter will have 1/4 of the mass) Thank you
I found it interesting as well!!!!!
Can someone please help me as fast as possible What is going inside the pvc?
Please ! What's that thing you put into the bow ?
I'm here because the corona virus got me freaked out. Shout out world
Is there a list of materials you could make available?
What size are the markers? 8mm?
I did the same concept, but with a crossbow, and it worked amazingly.
You should put all the measurements in cm mm and metres

Thank you brother. I have made this and I am pleased. Also, you have inspired me too start making weapons.

God bless you and DEUS VULT!!!
Can you please tell me the full details of these materials and where to buy them
Awesome video really looking forward to making the bow, just one question where can I buy the driveway markers?
We don't have "driveway markers" in England, what could we use instead?
What are the tools he said 🤔🤔
What are the tools
Why do i picture Frank Zhang when I saw his face?
Can you please give me all the PVC sizes what I need for the 70 pound pleasseeeeeeee
If the zombie apocalypse ever happens I’m finding this guy
What are those yellow sticks?
Mine dosent curve like that when I put the rope on can someone help
What else can you use if you don't have a vile to make the notches?
Show me its features, hehahahsha
what are the yellow bars called ?
This is so sick
how many FPS?
a recurve bow can store and provide more power to an arrow than a longbow of the same size could.

It didn't work
Where can I get since of those driveway markers from?

Corona viruses is hitting hard and i just gotta re watch this to make sure i didnt forget anything
what is an alternative for the fiberglass highway markers?
Just made this bow today... Still gotta tweak it some but i love it and its awesome!!! Youre amazing and keep up the awesome work
Make that recurve damn recurve are sexy am I alone in that
Apparently there are people who need to be told what a recurve is
Dude holy your dopelganger is nat wolff holy you look the same and sound the same wow  splitting image wow.
6:00 that it has like the same Power 🤣🤣🤣 Bro u puted a box in front of a wooden wall and now u are shooting it with both bows, both can shoot through the box but not through the wall, thats why they stick in there as same length🤣 But still a cool bow ;)
Can someone write down names of materials for this bow.        Thank u.
The recurve bow is a Hungaryan invention, and its special feature is, that when you put the nerve on it, you curve it backwards, thus creating more power with the same material hence the name "recurve".I know this because I am hungaryan myself.
What is that yellow thing
Pvc pipes in my country are as strong as a small candle, so what should I use to make a powerful bow in India
👏👏👏👏👏
Hey man, I’ve spent the past 4 yrs trying to convince my parents to let me build this, and today was the day. It went ‘meh’. I didn’t proportion the markets the same and came out with a bow like your big one. It’s cool though. I do plan to take it hunting which should be fun
I made it without the driveway markers... it’s still really good
does anyone know an alternative of the highway markers?
No tools is no tools by hand hand
How long is the fiber glass?

@ZNA Productions im curious why the 45 pound recurve bow was better than the 80 pound bow, i tried to google it but didnt find why
cool
The “recurve” in the bows gives it an extra push so to say wich makes them go alot faster and the bows don’t have to be that big because of that reason

Will my bow snap if I do not put in the fiberglass?
Yes

One thing ive heard of for drawing back a larger pound bow, try shooting with the arrow over the thumb not the hand it will trigger different muscles and help to pull the bow back to the firing position on a longbow. Not as accurate for sighting down the arrow but should use most of the back muscles vs the shoulder and arm
i liked the video because of what you said about the recurve bow now im also curious!
How did you make the second recurve
Driveway markers! Wtf is that?   Looks more like Hawaiian bend spear fiber glass tubes...  Way more expensive..
“Moira Queen You have failed this city”
hi! thank you for the video, it is one of the easiest builds i have seen, i'm so excited to try to build it as soon as i get my question answered: what are the things you put in the middle of the pipe? i may have misread the translation or whatever, but i want to make sure i buy what is recommended.   thank you!
I have a democrat gun control ad before this video xD
Efficiency!
Dude such a cool Video! Like it a lot! Im not that big Commentary guy, but Videos like this deserve it.  greetings from Germany :)
What are the dimensions of your PVC pipe and the fibreglass markers
Hello, I am from another country, how it's the name of yellow bars or tools? Fibre glass bars?
Would you use the same formula for the Driveway Markers that you used for your 60" bow as you would for a 3/4" PVC 70" length bow?
You have any alternative of fibreglass rod?
how long PVC you use? How about diameter the fiberglass ?
Awesome
What type of paracord is he using
Imagine some guy in your area has this?!
The recurve just increases the speed I’m pretty sure
aw lil baby eli
Who just watched about bow out of curiosity from the show Arrow
"You have failed this city"
What is the length of the driveway markers
What we call the  thing that release  the bow rope??
Look at young Eli... so pure.
Great,time to rally!
yo so I made this like 3 years ago and its crazy powerful I appreciate the tutorial :D
Dude it doesn’t bore me at all. I love this stuff. Great job and thank for your hard work! Awesome!
I just need this to take care of the pesky squirrels!
Swol
Arrow spine is important for penetration. Good work, bro! Thanks
Lmao. So many people made this same video. 😂🤣
Made my first one based on this tutorial. Turned out ok but my concern are the notches to hold the bow string in place. It’s initially staying but it really doesn’t look too secure. I am wondering if I should have used a smaller diameter rat tail file? I did put in frowns too with a skinner file. I ended up filing to where you almost can see the hollow interior on one side. Likely that will make it less durable. Anyone else have suggestions? What diameter rat file is ideal? Plus my rat tail tapered at the end a bit. Not sure if that was the right kind to use.
You look half Filipino Half American Bro
Very nich
What are those sticks you put inside the PVC?
Awesome
Does anyone know of any replacement for the driveway markers? I did a quick search and where I'm from a pack of those would be 140usd which is obviously way overpriced.
5:58 The reason why the 70# bow is not penetrating as much as the recurve is because the arrow is too light. If the arrow was actually heavier, the heavier draw bow will get it to penetrate more. It has to do with the spine and physics of your arrow AND the bow itself. That is why you never shoot light arrows with a heavy draw bow. The arrow is bending a lot more as it is being fired compared to the recurve bow. Archers will figure out what spine arrow they need for the pound draw of the bow. Heavy arrows have to be shot by heavy bows in order to be efficient.  As you were shooting those arrows, eli, the arrows were not flying true. they were angled downward which is not good.
bowyer bible vol 1 would explain alot  basicly it is possible to have high poundage bows but have no actull power behind them i had a 55lb bow i made ((that was what the draw weight said)) be as weak as a 10lbs kids bow and the reason why is that it had very thick limbs wich made it harder to pull but eats up the potencial energy on the release  you got to get a good balance between thickness/thiness of limbs and draw weight since your 75lb bow is 1 inch thick  chances are the thickness is eating up the potencial energy but try to get a copy of bowyer bible vol 1 and it explain things alot better then i do.......also bow design also has alot to do with efficientcy the correct design can give you higher speeds for less draw weight BUT ALSO the tips will act like cams ((the round wheels on a compound bow)) giving the bow a natrual let off ((meaning you going to pull it and makeing up some numbers half way through the pull it might reach 50lbs but once you pull it all the way you be holding 45-35 lbs depending on how much let off it provides and by the way the let off will still have the streangth potencial of 50lbs even though its 45-35lbs
How many rods do you need to insert inside of it to make it powerful enough to kill a deer?
Found this randomly but its real cool.
Just use a shoe lace and a twig
Nice bow
4:05 No Turning Back. Change my mind. 4:10 Tyranny of Heaven. Change my mind. 4:22 Arsenic Bite 4b. Change my mind. 4:40 Wish-Ender. Change my mind.
Nice informative video but one thing you did not mention though,  is if the PVC were to break at full draw the fiberglass rods are going to keep you from getting hit by the PVC sections since they will maintain a degree of structuaral integrity. Also along the lines of NOT using power tools to build your bow is you could use a large pan of hot water to soften the 'limbs' and then a 1" by 4" piece of wood (or a 2x4) to form the limbs with, while keeping the middle five inchs for the grip as is or even being formed to fit your hand for better control and comfort while shooting. Thanks for sharing, and as soon as I hit 'send' I am on my way to Home Depot for a length of PVC and a few fiberglass rods but will be using some 1/8 " covered cable for the bowstring which will be reinforced at the tip to prevent it from damaging the tips.
Did he ever figure out the science of the design impacts?
is there any other thing i can use instead of drivermarkers? because in my country  i have ask in many hardware stores about drivermarkers but they dont know what im talking about, i dont know if they have another name in spanish, but i really want to make a bow like this. @znaproductions
I know this is a pretty old video but in case someone else didn't say it yet if you examine your video footage a little bit closer you'll notice that the recurve bow has a longer draw relative to its height I am no expert but I believe the recurve bow increases the length of the draw relative to the bows height, thus increasing length of time in which the bow can transfer energy to the arrow.
The recerv bow is better at close range due to its size and a long bow shoots long range
это твой брат?
Wtf is that bit at the end
Neighbors are not happy
Just made this, then realized that I down have arrows or know how to shoot it.
That is exactly the use of a recurve bow, to launch the arrow faster with lower poundage
Have you figured out why the recurve bow was more efficiënt
very crisp and nice video.  recurve is indispensable because it is a multiplier of power .
awesome! now I want to try that😎👍
Where do i buy the fiberglass marker??
Where you put the middle hole in to slot the arrows in?
WWlll is soon so I need this for any zombie outbreaks😬💀
Would this bow work for a kid
4 years. And still no recurve... every going to make a vid on it?
Good job and thanks from Tennessee hills
Thank you for this. It’s great advice. You should learn to shoot like this guy… https://youtu.be/BEG-ly9tQGk
The recurve bow transfers energy better
A recurve bow allows for more power the a regular bow of the same draw weight
Im looking to make a bow like rambos, to kill my enemys
Whats it the home depot box?
Try wrapping the fibreglass rods with tape before cutting, less splintering...
Wow amazing
Anybody know fiber glass in French?
How long should the pvc be and fiber glass be
How long is the highway marker? Does anyone know?
This guy looks like frank iero
Yeah okay 15$ what about the several hundred dollar computer you need to speed it up like that... what a load of horseshit unsubbed
I’m so confused how he makes the loop with the paracord someone help
YouTube recommendations, why?
Imagine caveman watching this video... No heat... Electricity Holy, did he 1st time shot exactly to the middle target?
I'm so impressed!!
please make a without pvc bow

How long are the driveway markers
What's the materials
Hey nice work,can you pls tell what was the yellow material you were using
Havnt been getting the bell notifications. Man you've got a lot more subs since last time I watched
Same string?
Interesting video on bow making , thanks bow man!!
Okay kids don't watch "We need to talk Kevin"
You should slide both loops around the bow, step through and slide the upper loop to the upper notch. It's much easier that way.
i request for whip😅
You dont need drive way markers I use the bars u use to make a tent
where I can buy a  Paracord
where can i buy these driveway markers online?

Recurve bows do to its design, actually do launch arrows further
10 years later : make a tank without power tools and heating stuff
now teach us how to make arrows
What are your targets made of? Becouse they seem homemade but can also hold in arrows from powerful bows.
Done subscribe cause what u did mean lot to me in my passion in archery
Finally I've seen this video a billion times and now I've got the supplies next to me.
Man the one that i made broke after 3 shots

Its so cool  I just killed my cousin and now there's no annoyance
Old English long bow - 175 lbs
Recurve looks like it bends and stores more kinetic energy better than the monster longbow. Just my observation from the last two clips in comparison.
The recurve bow, in your case, works because the curved bits at the end hold the string physically further from your body when the bow is drawn.  Watch the serious British longbow guys, and you’ll note that they have this awkward lean thing they do.  They do it because with the bow that long, the angle of the string intersects your body early, before you get to the bow’s full strength if you don’t.   Look at the video of you shooting the bow and watch the bottom half of the string.  The string hits your body at the same angle on both bows, which makes sense, your draw length is the same on both.  But, because with the longbow the string is in a different relation to the angle of the recurve bow, that means you aren’t getting the full draw on the longbow.  Which is why Native American hunting bows averaged around 45 pounds.  It’s a good combination of being able to draw and loose quickly and hitting hard enough to wound or kill a deer sized target.  You don’t need to be real strong to draw it, so anyone in the family can use it, and you don’t have to be standing at full height and leaning forward to get use out of it, so you have more options in how to approach the prey.   45 pounds and about the size of that recurve is just damned convenient for hunting in brush, and it’s about as powerful as you can get for a median height person using simple techniques and natural materials without just scaling it bigger.   But if you want to scale it bigger and get full use out of that longbow’s power, watch those Welshmen go at it for a while.
hi, what´s the diameter of the highway markers?, can i use instead fiber glass rods?. Excellent video
Recurve bows have a longer draw length because it goes till it hits the wood accelerating the arrow over a longer distance therefore upping speed for a lighter draw weight... it's like saying 50 pounds over 1 foot of acceleration or 40 pounds applied to accelerate over a foot and a half
Higher change of rate of acceleration...
The recurve adds speed because the ends act like levers different from the central "main" curve. As important, they add a more continuous (longer) acceleration just as the energy of the main curve is spent. They are "whipped" like the end of  leather whip right at the end of the main curves release of tension. Your long bows have power to launch heavier arrows, but for speed - recurve.
thanx for the knowledge brother. very cool, very useful. is the recurve also pvc?
How long are the FiberGlass markers?
Great video
Those sticks are nock WAY high too..
Don't shoot paracord in the rain though. It stretches way too much and you get bit eventually.
I hope stone age people get to watch this tutorial.
Awesome. We wait your next video: make arrow
The recurve bow has those recurved limbs so it will reflex and so it kinda like both sides working against each other to make more power your welcome👍 great vid
the muzzle energy of an arrow is actually the integral of string's pushing force times pushing distance, the pushing force is keep reducing along the distance. The 45lb recurve bow's max draw force is lower, but the force reduction along distance is more gentle and the pushing distance is longer, that makes the arrow more powerful then the 75lb monster bow
2:20 Arnold's bow off Predator
how do you make arrows?
I was interested in the re curve bow as well man..glad you picked up on it..
The recurve bow stores power in it's curved limbs, and that's why it is more powerful than a longbow. The Turks found that out centuries ago - where have you been?     ;   )
Now that we know how to make a homemade bow, awesome! But what about fuckin arrows?!
what kind of knot did you use for the bow?
Nah, nah it has not been four hecken years
Can someone tell me the exact materials one by one pls ?
Can I have the list of all the pieces that go into making this Bow!
With plastic its not an issue, but with harder materials you really wanna lift up your file there on the back stroke friend.
6.9 million views...      Nice
you can tell this is older because of the the music hes using. pretty weird
Hi, thank you for the tutorial. Any alternative to the fiberglass markers?
Heat gun and press it flat then heat and bend it to shape.
Your neighbors can come out from under their beds now.
Will it work if the length of the pipe is 5 feet
The point of the recurve alows the bow to bend and that makes you able to pull the string back farther meaning more draw weight  Edit: I hate autocorrect
Guys all you need a a pvc pipe, stove, shoe lace, and a wall saw.
Not gonna lie. I've made bows more powerful with thick sticks and a knife.
Like the ending. More than a simple tutorial.
You did a good work
Avengers wants to know your location
Recurve bows were mostly made for the horseback riding. It's easier to move around, and draw as well. Do that with a long-bow and get back to me.
Dummy thicc question: What PVC Material did you use?    I'm using a material simulation program to figure out what length, thickness and schedule to get a certain draw length and draw weight.
Does it have to be schedule 40 pvc?
And he's using a release aid to draw
Recurve bow is the best.We Hungarians kept the ancient Europe trembling with recurve bows for a while."Sagittis Hungarorum Libera nos, Domine" "God save us from the arrows of Hungarian".

Its very super
Can someone help me out with the materials in Australia? I'm not sure we have the same driveway markers here. I found some at Bunnings, but I don't think they are quite as thick, and not sure they are exactly the same material https://www.bunnings.com.au/sandleford-red-reflector-spike_p3291737
Awesome bro!!! Way to go man!!!
I built one out of a 3/4 inch pipe but it only fit three rods. Are you sure you didn't mean one inch?
Who built the 45 pound bow for you? I want to know how to make it
Sweet video dude! 😎👍 But yeah, that recurve bow looks wicked awesome compared to the rest. Build one please.
Superb home made bow...great...what does yur neighbour say to you ....watching you make great videos !!! And i really love your small workshop in yur house backyard
You are good bro not use power tools
Lmao just get 3 string and 3 sticks and put it in the crafting table. Smh my head
Maybe its the bouncing which makes it more efficient?
Bro how to make a good arrow without power tools
The arrow it too light for the 75lb bow to transfer all of its energy to it.
made this bow for Wasteland Weekend.
create content about making cross arrows from paralones
The curved bow made by your subscriber,  is designed centuries ago in India,  if you get an opportunity,  explore Indian medieval period weapons, over internet,
maybe the recurve bow gives more displacement
Can't believe I spent a lot of time amd money finding and buying 2 bows when I  could have done this :V
Does anybody knows where I can get those fiberglass in Europe? or at least does anybody has an AMAZON link to buy it?? I appreciate every answer or info! Thank y'all in advance!!! Greetings
thanks now i can survive in a zombie apocalypse
Good job!!!
Where did you buy the arrows
Recurved give more power at lower draw weights
Good job, I love the video and the bow 👏
Where do you get highway markers?
Why He did not do a Head Bow after the Good Lesson?
So how much for this bow
make some new content. your awesone!
composite bow's has curves too..
Did anyone notice that the last two bows test on the depth of the arrows we're actually false test. Both those arrows we're hitting the plywood on the backside of his tool bench. He should do it out in the open field. By the way I'm just too lazy to read your all's comments that's why I'm asking
Dude has M U S C K L E S
Do you have a pvc alternative that would work in cold conditions?
Neat.
nice bro
Somebody! tell me pls! What does he mean when he says: driveway markers. English is not my native... And i dont understand what is this 3 items... Thanks a lot
Turkish bow
Maybe he did NOT lie..maybe it is 60 to 70 lbs pull. It did same as your "75+ lbs  pull" and way better than 35 to 45 pull the subscriber bow was the best yet you tried knocking it !
you are using the same arrow for every bow, you need use a longer arrow for the 75 pound bow to get 75 pound of force
Thanks for sharing. I finally tried this. It is a beast: https://youtu.be/5C8reQLXBdw
Leafyishere got jacked
Perhaps the arrow shot from monster bow doesn't have the distance to get to higher speed? Just asking
You can make mabey a crossbow
I think that only the speed of returning the string is important as long as the pull power exceedes the str required to accelerate the weight of the projectile without losing momentum.  Max kenetic force is then probably determined by projectiles travel distant, airodynamic, weight and impact area size.
Who is here to get ready for zombie apocalypse??? And worried about the zombie deer and mad cow disease??
Sounds like Michigan whether.
Nicely done ZNA!
Cool,  now I can make my own bow
I imagine the first step to unlocking your mystery is a heat gun.
any video on making that 75 lb bow? im new to archery and interested in going the pvc route before i start spending the bank on stuff i know nothing about. anyone feel free to correct me plese, but with a 80 lb pvc bow is it possible to make it a recurve? again i strictly know nothing. thank you in advance for literally any positive feedback.
Where can I buy the products necessary to make the bow?
{
So the more highway markers you have in a bow, the more power it has?
i want the subscriber to send me a bow
this video was pretty cool I like it. Now I want to make bows just like that. i will write down the materials and the tools you showed in this video and follow your instructions to make my very own bow. I really hope to see more videos like this one. Keep up the good work pal
Time to make some bows
That’s cool maybe you could make one out of wood
In this video you sound like a guy from new jersey telling us how to bypass nj weapon laws
I have no idea why I watched this video but I'm glad I did. I wouldnt replace my razorback with one of these but hey,  it's a pretty cool way to burn a Saturday afternoon.  By the way, bro. Where do you hide your weed?
You were holding the “monster” bow as you put it, towards the upper half compared to the other bows you used. If you hold it in the middle then it will generate more power
That was pretty cool. Thanks for making this video! =)
A 35-pound bow is already a no joke. Let alone the 45.
What type of knot did you make the string into?
Will any drive way marker work
You should read about Mongolian composite bow
Não sei não Rick, me parece falso!
Just so anyone knows, dont leave your bows out in the sun if you wanna make it last long😂 my 3 year bow finally gave out today right in the middle but it came from me leaving it outside exposed to the elements probably. Time to make a new one!!! P.s. fiber glass rod core didnt break however.
you're shooting close range and that's what recurved bows are made for
Hey everyone here is how I made my own homemade bow https://youtu.be/om9KRDgD0Ic

Can i use thinner fibire glass but a few more pieces instead？
What are the items that should be needed to make that bow ?
13 dollers
Would you recommend making a wooden bow or this?
How do you find the nocking point?
How do you keep the markers in the pipe?
Looks solid for me...
Just laying on my bed not even trying to do that...
Thank you, sir! I will be making this bow.
Thank you
Recurve bows are designed to have more force in a smaller bow with a lower draw weight, so it stands to reason, a recurve bow with a 45 lbs draw weight might compare to a 60-80 lbs longbow. Due to the shape of the recurve, it provides a more effective storage of energy, and thereby a more efficient transfer of energy into the arrow. Therefore the subscriber’s estimate may have been based on equivalent draw weight in an ordinary longbow, not actual draw weight.
I can't stand people who say purdy instead of pretty. Purdy is not a word, or ain't you noticed.
Very very nice 👍 sig
A question. Couldn’t you make the arrows from the lane markers? Also I would use the paracord to make a grip on your bow.
Recurve has multiple fulcrum points?
Bro, just so you know... I'm gonna be a wealthy man within the next five years. You're hired.   For what you ask? I'll answer your question with a question...   What can't you do? Thank you sir. Great job!
That is ok.. arrow?
Hold the damn thing vertical as you are supposed to.  You look like the silly action movies where idiots hold the gun sideways.  I can't hit anything with a pistol when I hold it correctly. If you want your survivalists to tilt the bow, they won't
Isnt it just 3 sticks and 3 string
I’m confused how did u tie the loop?
Mine snapped
Like for ever ago
This was the first video I watched of him
Fantastic editing & paced thank you for a great video!
THX! I can finally protect myself against my brother
Am i the only 1 who watch this bcuz we watch too much of Green Arrow😅?
Hallo, nice video. The recurve gets its power from the end of the limps. I sa on your vid you arnt able to ancer the heavy bow  as you can do with the recurve bow.  Otherwish it is the tension  and the release technic. Without a complaind your vids are brutal!! Here in the netherlands whe  say heftige shit. Keep going strong
Hey i do appreciate videos like this because when i was younger, my brother and I would always be out in the shop making homemade weapons and such, but back then there was no YouTube. The things i know now that i didn't know back then.
Yaaaay this is great
What is the hight of that pvc
Recurve does provide more benefit towards the draw/release. With wood recurve, the wood deforms when drawn and the additional strain of the recurve grants more "weight" than otherwise the stave of the bow could provide. I assume this carries over with most metallic bow staves (maybe) I have no idea if that would would on pipe so much... worth checking. I would guess it would have some effect, but that the actual effect would vary between bow stave materials. As I understand it, the recurve in a bow stave provides greater initial acceleration to the released projectile, therefor giving it more "weight". <-- Simplified.
There is a secret ending...  Boyfriend comes in.
Maybe your just a cry baby so you wear gloves to dont get splinterd
What are those he gloves he uses?
Thanks for the nice video. What's the string made of?
OK is the bow unstringable?
the recurve bow has more points of articulation. so it launches the arrow faster. for ballistic penetration, its all about speed. mass x speed = force. the point acts as a magnifier for the force, concentrating it all on 1 point for the rest of the projectile to force it through whatever medium. science.
That are these yellow things???
What are those fibre glass things called outside the US?
he didnt tell you how important scoring all the way around the highway marker before cutting threw so it does not splinter.
Hi! Asking for some help. What if there aren't fiberglass rods available? Any alternatives that I can use? Can I use a smaller diamater pvc pipe and telescope it in?
anyone else gonna use this shiiit on next demonstrations?
Now we need to know how to make perfect arrows.
Excelent.
This was the first PBC bow I made, and the worst.  I've made several dozen since according to the method of the Backyard Bowyer.  This one is powerful but lacking in action.  It actually doesn't throw an arrow as well as a better made bow -a horse bow or recurve- of less poundage but better geometry.  Weight is only half the equation and a better bow isn't that hard to make.  It can be done over your stove in the kitchen.  This one would be OK in a pinch but only till you could learn the science of what makes a bow really work.  I did, and I'm still learning.
You still used a tool
Recurves tend to have more power relative to the draw weight because the way the limbs curve acts more like a spring than long bows.
Что за жёлтые фиговины он внутрь затолкал. Я не понял никуя, он тараторит быстро.
Recor bow is doing recoil and the arrow is pushed by it
Litterally using compound releaser with a longbow😂
Nice
How prevent rotate the spring rods?
What is the string you used?
Did you say 3 driveway markers???
Fiberglass rods
Definately won't be sneaking around around your backyard bro ..... Awesome !!
Made a pcv bow w/o the core for some small game hunting, but need arrows, heh
That is indeed the entire point of a recurve bow, is to get more power from a lower draw weight. Originally used by the mongols from horseback, iirc
Dont use a PVC. Just get a real recurve.
Instructions unclear, my dog is stuck in the toilet
recurve bow is used in mongolians it look small and have not too much pounds recurve gives more force when you shot
В России можно просто найти все детали  на свалке
yes it is necesaaey
You wouldn’t happen to live in Missouri would you
You can tell the one he made is not straight and the curve bow is straight
Nobody:     Him: weather report time
Nice and good
People who actually made the bow was it good and how long did it last
Hello.  My English is poor.  so I do not understand what kind of three metal bars?
How long is the bow? I'm trying to make one.
i know its 2019 now but i have a challenge for you. make a compound bow. any type power tool or not
Good bow
For the 75 pound bow just make something like a billista that pulls it back with a crank or something then load them make some sort of firing mechanism
Time to murder evil carnappers here in our area   or maybe just shoot an arrow on their knees
Have re-build a Bow like this.....it was cool and was very functionaliy........... UNTIL........the Cops appears on MY Yard that i own (big Garden) and take my Bow and says: it's forbidden to have a Weapon like this....even on your private Area...... Germany sucks
в Сибири на морозе этот пластик хрупкий.может по соплям дать.
for a beginner would 35 pounds be a lot and would there be any way to make it less powerful
What is the size of fibre glass
i usually just put a good spring steel rod inside
What is the release mechanism you are using on your right hand?
how durable is this? 500shots? hpw often should i change the paracord?
Hahaha! 90 degrees outside makes you burn? DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH EVEN FURTHER.
I made the bow and without any tweaking at all it pulls almost 60 pounds. Insane what some fiberglass and PVC piping can do.
Can i use the fiber glass rods from an old Coleman tent?
What lb Paracord are you using?
Please tell the things you have used for makeing bow and arrow because i have to make it and your voice iss not clear
Just look at 6:08  and 6:16. You can clearly see the draw length difference. That's why they impace engergy is about the same.
Paracord I'd imagine is a shitty bow string, ever used anything less doomsday?
Hey #modernrogue this is how you make a pvc bow.
Right then i'm on my way up to the shop.
5:43 yes the recurve adds to velocity of the arrow however , your video is very good and very useful , I hope you continue doing what you do and continue perfecting your style of bows. Thumbs up
Brother what's the name of yellow one small pip
Powerful... hahahahahaha dont make me laugh
is that schedule 40 pvc? ever use schedule 80 or 120?
Recurve acts like a coil spring at each end decreasing the recovery time of the nock of the string hence velocity at release is increased. The faster the nock recovers the faster the arrow will be moving and impact energy = mass of the arrow  x the velocity squared of that arrow. Hence an arrow weighing 280 grains fired by a mediaeval longbow travels at about 175 fps; from a commercial recurve that velocity is 225 fps; commercial compound (pulley) bows give 290 fps.   Impact energies Longbow arrow - about 1,200 foot pounds Recurve - about 2,000 foot pounds Compound - about 3,350 foot pounds For comparison a .22 LR (32 grain) has an impact energy at the muzzle of about 8,500 foot pounds
Wow never thought there is channel like this.. So cool man😊😊
The curve in the bow adds more leverage for a lower draw
Could I make a bow with just driveway markers if I don't have access to PVC?
Steel core?
It was 90* (hammering down with rain now) I don't know what's going on? Try looking into "Chem-trails" geo-engineering, barium,aluminium, chemically = BA AL. Sweet dreams.
How long are those markers and PVC?
This video got me wondering if it were legal to shoot or even to have a self-made bow like this in California, in the state where blowguns are illegal (and I don't even wanna get started about weed)?!
1:20 Thanks for the weather update.
💯
Prepare the Way for the Messiah, He will Pray to the Father, for Us to have the Spirit of God, for a Teacher, and Comforter, Forever, in the Bible book of John, chapter 14, verse 26. John, chapters 14, through 17, are Spiritual Rebirth Chapter... soon children soon... Peace
I sliced my hand open making wood arrows.. had to get like 4 or 5 stitches
No homo but you're good looking. 😊
The recurve is essentially like two bows in one with an easy draw weight. Easy to draw also means easier to train. That's the Mongols' choice!-Ghengis Khan
How about taking consideration when every time you shoot the f****** box it's not going to go in as deep as it potentially can every time your experiment is not accurate at all at all at all at all!! Get with it dude put your thinking cap on
Made a bow like this (a bit smaller) for my son, but had to take it off him. It was just too deadly. He was 6!
What length should the arrow be
2019?
Why the fuck would you bother? Negged!
I am Brazil !
Recurves generally have a much higher FPS than a straight longbow.
Really neat. What exactly are the yellow fiberglass things that go inside? Where can you find these items? Thanks :)
Don’t pull it back in the cold!
How do we make a gun like someone who isn't from the 18th century?
I never get tired of seeing this... you are awesome bother
bruh you shouldn't have a clamped fist while using a bow
if the bow strung at 4" is 0 and the bow full drawn at 28" is 100, then the normal bow goes from 100 to 0 in a split second, lets say 0.2seconds, driven by the force of the draw, lets say 50lb. then we look at the recurve bow, with the same 50lb draw, it reaches zero in 0.1seconds. why? the arc of the normal bow drawn fully to 100 is 12"/30cm past 0 and must move that distance at 200kmph/120mph, while the recurve bow has 2, 3, or 4 arcs and each is respectively drawn back a fraction of that 12" distance; 3-6"/8-15cm, then for each arc of the recurve bow to move 3-6" at 120mph takes 1/2 the time of the normal bows 12" arc at the same speed. This in turn drives the arrow faster at a lower poundage draw weight.   hopefully that makes sense.
What knot does he use
Dude, no.
Where'd you buy the highway marker?
What's the diameter and length of the fiberglass rods?
The bow with the curved ends is a now that the Turkish and middle eastern countries used EXTREMELY POWERFUL small bows
Today’s date is 6/7/2019 I’m about 3 years late on this but I made one, it cheated me about $35 with all the tools and stuff, but when I made the frowns and pulled it back it came off and hit my hand! It hurt so bad so my dad gave me the idea to put 2 holes on both sides and pull the cord out and tie a knot. I didn’t not have a drill so I used a skrewdriver, a big skrew, and a box cutter, it came out great! So just an idea for those of you trying it now.

Great vid - the re-curve bow look cool... how to make?
“The native Americans used to hunt deer and elephants with this”
Built this for my cosplay for Wasteland Weekend and loved it!!!
Metric, please
You fire a gun, you shoot a bow. The term fired comes from the powder flash of the first flint locks. Good video though, thanks.
The recurve creates a snap at the end. Like learning to snap your wrist when throwing or bating.
the recurve bow moves more and longer threw out the release more mass moving with the string rather then just the string .
Articulate, observant, creative. Keep up the good work.
I think this video more powerful diy bow, CMIIW.
Lol stick to your school studies bro. Be a doctor or something.... ching wah needs to learn physics before hunting....
it might be the precision of the force you're dispensing the moment you release the draw string, that could affect the power directed to the arrow. the force probably disperses much more greatly with the long bow due to the much higher resistance and rigidity from the pvc pipe, which probably takes away from the amount of power directed to firing the arrow. with the recurve bow, the energy isn't wasted as much, so more of it is directed to the arrow for a more powerful and accurate shot (one end doesn't shift from the x direction as much, allowing for a straighter shot.)
What size paracord should i use im trying to buy some but dont know wich one to get
Apparently the type of paracord matters, I used a stretchy kind, and my bow didn't ture out that great.
Why don't make a hole for the notch?
Replacement for fiberglass
When you're making your notches you want to angle the more towards the belly of the bow.
Can someone give me a link to the fiberglass rods on Ebay I cant find ones that'll be sufficient
1:19 a more accurate representation of Canada
Makes a fiberglass bundle, doesn't show the whole thing...
Really cool bro , good work
cool can you make a custom bow that is more powerful than your current one?
Rambo First Blood goes Millennial
I enjoy the blooper parts. 😂
This tutorial is bad. I could do better and in one comment.    3 sticks and 3 string.
what are the exact dimensions of the driveway marker?
I use to make these when I was 12. Obviously a weaker version though lol.
I once made a 60+lb recurve bow out of 3/4"pvc without fiberglass, it was cool. The thing put  our 50lb compound bow to shame, which was amazing. I could manage about 5 shots before my arms got too tired. A past of the success was because I made a string for it rather than use paracord. The string doesn't stretch, so you get better energy transfer and less wobble upon release. Highly recomend both heat-moulding, and making a proper string.
Very skillful. Powerful info. You did that presentation well. Thanks.
Who the fuck are you? Mcgyver?!
recurve bows are in fact more efficient for their draw weight.
Thats actually pretty brilliant. I have always made wooden ones and found they wont last long
What's the pvc length? I heard it was 3/4inch diameter, but I didn't catch the length
Way cool video.
What is that yellow thing?
Can i use 4 fiberglass?
recurve bow is a long  bow that is recurved, which gives the same power for a shorter length.
Genghis kahn grew huge because of the recurve bow...look it up
Yeah, now show me how to make a crossbow.
sir what is the           size and schedule of pvc pipe          then what kind of glass fiber used for it where can i buy that           what kind of rope u r using for it               kkindly pls reply sir .........
Very cool video thanks
Very cool 👍
Did you make a video of the recurve bow?
The end hahah!
Does anyone know a good replacement for driveway markers? I can't seem to find them where i live or online that can deliver here.
Does anyone have a link to the materials used in this video?
Mongols used recurve bows to conquer the world. They would fire from horseback, as they retreated. They would fire well-aime arrows, as they tried to separate the end of the cavalry from the infantry. Eventually, their own heavy cavalry would charge in, and mop up.
Yep, that's exactly right!  The recurve has a faster launch without needing the higher poundage.   Recurve is great for tighter spaces that still need the strength of the shot.  When the hunter is in amongst the trees and the hunted is in the open. Aunt B
Don't use nylon para chord as a bow string, it stretches too much and you loose energy to it.  Use polyester chord, about the same cost, and little to no stretch.  The best is polyester artificial sinew, no weave, all the fibers run parallel, it will take several strands, but works the best.
boys wearing earrings....wtf
Excellent video . The re-curve bow is PVC also ? You can soften PVC by submersing it in boiling water ( adding a pound of table salt or two will get water temp. higher , not necessary but adds a lubricating effect also )  It makes PVC real malleable , it will bend and flatten easily .
Love the bloopers.
maybe its not the Bows.... maybe its the operater.
Nice nice nice  bro I like it
Wow, your an absolute star...lovin the outtake clips, hilarious...I’m now goin to make one...thankyou
The music in this video is sickening and abusive. It's not really music, but rather extremely offensive coordinated noise and sound effects. If I was forced to listen to it for a while, it would make me want to kill myself to make it stop. Thank God the volume was turned way down. Please never do this to us again.
This so fascinating, archery is my passion and I love when people encourage others to try archery ,thank you ,you are awesome !!
I will try to make one
What is the kind of thread
Nice bro ive seen this already but i dodnt remember.
Every creature surrounding me is in serious danger now🥴
I think the curve bounce the force more so it has more penetrating power than the ordinary one... I guess
Hawkeye childhood
How do you keep the markers from sliding back out of the pvc pipe?
you must live in Texas with those sudden weather changes
What we call to that thin stick
it is good
I bet Odysseus could spring the 75 all the way back
No not boring at all, very kool and yes I'd like to see you make the the curved bow
How is this bow holding up now?
I'm really surprised you don't know about recurve bow.
Which subcriber make that one its awesome i also want one
Have you ever made your own bow string using braided fishing line ?
Why so many thumbs down?
weird, did i get that right? ... the one with the pulley was not the better one? i never used a bow other than when i was in boy scouts once but i would have thought the one with the pulley's on it would have been the best one  ... im guessing the pulley does not add to the strength of the shot? (i just assumed the pulley would have given you the strongest pull)
Look at the Mongolian bows, all re-curves ++ extra power off the line
The Mongols used a recurved bow, and they used it with great skill on horseback. Once united under Genghis Khan, the Mongols became one of the most deadly war machines ever.
I've watched this video 3 times before I got the secret ending
Is their any substitute for driveway markers??
Your most powerful bows arrow hit the plywood on the backside of the target not allowing it to penetrate further.
now you just armed everyone watching your video.
nice video and very impressive results.the recurve bow looks very nice
A question: How long did/do these bows hold up? I know PVC will get brittle after a while, so I wonder what the longevity of one of these is, 3-5 years maybe?
Now, how to make arrows?
Not boring. Super intriguing.
Awesome videos mate can you make one with a fishing reel attachment
There isn't any skill in this; it's no fun this way, using natural materials is so much better.
The Mongolians used recurved bows for a reason
I hate how millenials talk. Why is every statement a damn question. Are you so unsure of yourself?
The man doesn't even know how to weild a bow properly. Probably gets his meals from the grocery's
Forget the bow. The guy is cute.
have you put a red 'filming' light on the door yet :P
You are cute...
Almost exactly xD
Hahaha, I love the bloopers! This just got into my recomended section and i'm honestly gonna try to make myself this bow. Excellent!
Fuckin glen trying to sell me a bow
get yourself a vise
note recurve bow has a different resting state, thus is way faster then a long bow
does anyone else think he looks kinda like kaif??
Hi. how long and thick are your fibreglass highway marker rods?
How to make it with a wood
what are the tools and materials you used?
I think PVC Bow...only strong in 2 month. After that it can broken.  Better to make laminating Bow
The recurve is tighter and smaller than the long bow. The recurve is easier to shoot on foot and even on horseback, but lacks the power of the long bow.
How to do horse.... Want to ride and shoot the bow like in the historic movie
Thanks. Your super cool and super professional. I subscribed and hit the bell. If you have done some research on that bow, please make a video about it. Thanks.
because of it's shape, the ends of the recurve bow essentially act like a lever; this is where the extra power comes from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iy0WzXExgY Looks like your subscriber made a turkish bow. The shape gives it extra power and it works best with light arrows.
Thank you for showing psychopaths How to kill the rest of us with cheap weapons.
Thanks. Good Job.
what is the size of the fiberglass?
I don't know if I'm missing something but what is keeping the  fiberglass inside the PVC?
recurve bow allows you to shoot harder with less energy
I know this is old but a recurve is made, as you said, to be just as strong as a long bow with a lower draw weight. It’s effective but not as effective as a traditional long bow
What kind of fiberglass rods are you using?
Recurved somehow acts like a spring and stores energy.I haven't done Archery in forever and forget.
Loved the outtakes
The re-curve utilizes more kinetic energy than the long bow thus more power to it.
Can you please comment here the item like pvc etc..
A real nice bow.  If you edited the start any finer thenyouwouldhaveaconstantmonologueofsound;watchitagainifyoudon'tbelieveme.  That said, I like how you're making archery accessible for all.
Recurve bows are smaller than long bows but have the same power. Which makes it suitable  for horse archers.
Its not 'somehow' curved bows are more powerfull than normal bows, it has been like that since inmemorial times.
your boring comments were what made me subscribe!
the difference between a long bow and recurve is that the long bow was invented many years ago, recurves not so much. the recurve design gives more of a spring action than a straight wooden or pvc bow, the flattened ends and curved shape acts like a spring compared to a straight piece of material, adding more speed per pound of pressure.
I wanna learn how to make that 45 recurve
the reason the recurve bow does better is because the bow itself is bending more and storing energy in those curves on either end
I love when tutorial videos don't add material list in the description
Yea the recurve bow gives higher power for a lower draw weight and is as good as or better than the longbow but took longer to make so they usually used longbows
Longbows are not for extra penetration, longbows are for lofting arrows ballistacally at extreme long range. The recurve is for firing from horseback.
Buy a gun, it makes all men equal.
Youtube algorhythm brought me here
I heccing love archery, imma heccing make dis art uwu
I know this is old but thanks this should come in useful within the next couple of years although I'm waiting for a special order recurve right now before Society crumbles😁
You would need a heavier arrow for more penetrating power to show on the big bow.
The recurve bow was sick
This is three years old now but the answers to your questions.  Yes recurve bows are more efficient than a standard bow however the main reason you are not getting as much penetration with the 75lb bow is the assumption you made that getting close to the full draw must mean you are getting close to 75lb.  In actuality the power to draw ratio is not 1:1 but a logarithmic scale.  This means if you are just 3% off of the full draw you have far less than 72.75lb of draw.  You are probably only getting around 40lb of draw.
I used to hunt with a 70 pound bow. I needs that monster bow
Не понял. Что такое вообще эти ваши "driveway markers"?
Great video! But ‘no power tools or heat’ means almost nothing in this context, it’s like saying ‘cold charcoal’ ,even by your loose definition you didn’t quite come close, but you made some great things outside of that limiting context, try refining your showmanship and tightening your verbiage. You have crazy skills, stringing a bow as casual as you did shows you know the techniques, YouTube should pop you up outside the gaming community!
im here for   30% learning how to make a bow  70% for the muscles ahahha
I made a bow string using lead from market and a freaking metal pole thing for building and an arrow that is from a heavy duty umbrella, its so weak, and it ended up being a powerful crossbow lol
Materil in aarrow plz tell
In the test where the result for the large bow and the recurve bow I have an explanation. To start the advantage of the recurve design is the added flex it gives at the ends allowing for a longer draw. Additionally while bending the bow in this manner the direction of the force you apply to the string and the force the string translates to the bow has a more shallow angle to the arrow allowing for a better translation of power as you loose the string.  As for the large bow there's a good possibility that the actual bow is too straight meaning that the force allpied to the middle of the string and the angle of force applied to the edges of the bow is too shallow. Effectively this means that you are not only pulling the string back, but also pulling the edges towards you just to initialise the bend. If you would reduce the stiffness and weight at the edges of this bow you may feel that it's draw becomes easier and perhaps it's actual effective power is most likely closer to the recurve bow. Cheers.
Imagine Hawkeye teaching his daughter with this bow.
Physics....interesting stuff, huh?
I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee.
fuck lock thefucking  door you could have killed him
We don't get those "highway markers" in the UK (I've never seen one if we do)  I doubt a plastic traffic cone (of which we have about eleventy gazillion!) would add much to the bow!  Any alternatives?
really interested in knowing how to make the bow that was gifted to you> be cool to see how to make it and even a pvc version of it if thats possible?
Recuve is the long u draw the more poundage u get
Compound not pully
A recurve bow does exactly what you said - give more power with a lower draw weight. Because the bow naturally wants to curve away from the string, it’s speed to rest is greater than a regular bow.
Very interested in the recurve bow. Please do.
Can you give me
Hey, Recurve Bows are more powerful because the extra bend on either end allows for more spring. You are no longer getting a bend from just the middle of the shaft; each end of the bow also bends. So basicallly, it's like having miniature bows on each end of your bow, but at lower draw weights. Because of that, the "bows" on the end reach their max  draw weights (×2) before the actual main bend in the entire bow as a whole. This means the bow bends much farther, even though the actual distance the arrow travels remains the same.   Recap-  More spring from a bow on a bow = more potential energy with the same amount of space= more force.   I know that might be hard to follow since I am not using any technical terms, but hopefully that will explain why recurve bows are so nice.
Can you show how to make a bow
I love at the very end... You think the video is done but just wait for the weirdness... Lol love it
Pro-tip: put a piece of tape around the area you are cutting on the fiberglass to help prevent splinters.  You can still breathe them while cutting
Thank you, my recurve is broken and whenever I take a shot the vibration send the arrow flying to the side (its the bow not me it doesn’t do it with any of my other bows) and I’m in need of a replacement while I’m also pretty low on money
The reason for the recurve is to eliminate some vibration in the bow and turn horizontal energy into vertical energy. The recurve shape means that the ends of the limbs are accelerating faster than the rest of the limb therefore you get more arrow speed. Also in terms of stored energy and energy efficiency (not regarding bow shape) whichever bow has the least weight (physical weight of the bow) will usually have the most efficient energy transfer. (If they're all the same shape, quality and material.) Great video
ik this is about 4yrs to late, but as someone tht does know a bit about military and arms history, the big bow is under preforming because the arrow is too light. u prob need a thicc dole nd a heavier arrow head
Very good, but did you know the draw weight of the Welsh longbow was 180lbs, most people today probably couldn't use it, it was obligatory to train as children so an adult could be called to arms, thus creating a weapon that if captured, could not be used by the enemy; it also had an effective range of 1000ft.
Dude ur throwing the release
The heavier draw a bow has, the heavier abd rigid the arrows should be. Lighter arrows flex too much when fired by a heavy bow.
Tape your fiberglass tubes where you cut them = no splinters.
I made a bow my own made up by bamboo and it was awesome I killed a squirrel and broke my mom's property 😂 it was 3 years ago and my mom burned it to ash
The native Americans used reverve to have a faster arrow and less poundage
Nice
question. Does it have to be fiberglass?
you just gained a sub bro
Generally speaking, if a fiberglass arrow does not have any breakage, will it ever splinter people?   Is it technically possible for it to splinter people if it doesn't have any breakage? Or does it only splinter if it has breaking in it?
I know this is old video but a recurve bow packs the same amount of power in a shorter package as a long bow does of the same draw weight. Nothing more really.
JoergSprave and you need to collaborate
You think this would work with .5 inch pvc?
i made  one of these bows with 4-foot long PVC and one fiberglass Rod and it works great
Ive made these they shoot well
It's likely that that arrow is not tuned to that heavy bow.  Arrows and bows tuned to each other will maximize penetration.
We donr have roadway markers like that over here. I looked pretty much everywhere for fiberglass rods in vain
Capitalists in 3..2..1
This is sort of like watching my kid play Minecraft Great video!
Coming back home in 2019, Eli you ever going to make that recurve bow?
You are beautiful
Where can u buy all this stuff?
You should do a how to make a steel bow.
Yep, that curve in the recurve bow adds a bit extra fling into launching the arrow.  Badass video man.
🤣😭
I cannot find the driveway markers
I'm making this one for my wife and I, as our first experiment into bows and arrows. What arrows would you recommend for this bow, that fits the Paracord properly? Thank you.
*_Katniss Everdeen has entered the chat_*
Is it okay to use upvc instead of pvc?
I wear a hazmat suit whenever im in the same room as fiberglass
Very cool video man!
This is exactly what I do at the construction site when my boss is gone electrical pull string works great as a bow string.  Bravo kiddo!
No. Don't.
I used to have a 75lbs pvc long bow but it broke in my hands after 2 years of using because of the sunlight exposure...
Hands down to the subscriber who has gifter the bow
This is the first video I had watched on your channel and here I am 3 years later
You should know how to draw well and maybe learn a bit in archery before you shoot bow and arrows
We made bows in the exact same way back in the 70s, only we used bamboo in the center instead. Was good enough for hunting small animal
$10 multiplied by Rp.15.000/$ = Rp.150.000 Dang, still too expensive
Video about how to make a bow, doesnt know the technology behind re-curve bows.    errmmm ok, confidence 2.0 installed
What's a driveway marker?
I tried finding your channel and I only see some other guy with a similar name. Help?
If your target isn't locked down solid, you will always have an unseen variable in your test for depth. The movement of the target as it's being struck will cause the arrow's penetrating force to lessen. Try setting a bale of hay on top of your target to weigh it down so it wont move. or just find some way to stabilize it.
Please make the bow!
Nice vid man
Where can I get the fiberglass highway markers?
If you don’t mind the splinters, your a psychotic evil villain
What's that yellow thing called???
When you make the recurve, I will be watching. And thanks!!
Checkout "the zipper" recurve bows. Crazy awesome fast.
Samurai bow out did the english long bow different shape as well
All information here was very useful - great vid.
I can be a cupid like the dream i always  wanted.
My swole boy
can I substitute thin bamboo pieces for the highway marker things you say?
this is exactly like the king of random one but posted 3 years before
I've read a lot of comments that try to explain why the recurve is shooting more efficiently, yet none thus far has mentioned the most important aspect: mass.   When you loose an arrow, you're not only accelerating the arrow, you're also accelerating the bow itself. Heavier limbs and tips mean less energy is going towards the arrow, thus a slower shooting bow.   the "subscriber" bow is made out of 3/4 inch PVC and it DOES NOT contain fiberglass rods, it's simply heated and tapered, which means it's thicker at the handle and gets flatter towards the tips. This results in less overall mass. The recurve design essentially has the effect of having a longer limbed bow, making it more efficient. It also reduces an effect called "stack" (meaning that the draw will feel more even rather than get harder to pull towards the end as the angle between the tip and the string reach 90 degrees, as is the case in longbows).   The reason why the "monster bow" didn't perform as well is mainly because you weren't pulling it all the way back, longbows have a tendency to stack towards the end of the draw, meaning that you're losing a lot of energy by not drawing it all the way, even if it's 2 inches or so less than full-draw. Another reason is that it has significantly more mass including that of the larger 1-inch pipe and the fiberglass rods.  One might think, "wait, aren't the fiberglass rods and larger diameter pipe supposed to have more power?" the answer is yes, they do, however, it's an issue of balancing that extra power with the extra mass.   Put simply, light and well designed bow of decent or even light draw weight is a better performer than bulky, more massive longbow of very heavy draw weight.
It was nothing to do with the bow, it was to do with the arrow weight and penetration...
Yeah, do a video on the recurve bow. That'd be way awesome. 😎👍 Oh, and I love this video too btw. You've got some great videos dude. 😊  Love the bloopers too. He he! 😋
Music name???
Does the curve of the bow keep the fiberglass cores in place? Or do they shift when fired?
Is there an alternate material for the fiberglass?
Nice presentation bro, to the point, thank you much.
I'd like to buy all of the bows for 80$ dollars..!!!!
Make the second taekwondo bow
You are so cute. 😊😍😍
I want to learn this. To kill the rapist in our country. They ruined the innocent life of girls.
I bet this guy has no friends and never been laid
KE is speed times mass the recurve adds more speed less mass so high KE the op bow has more mass less speed so it has about the same KE (force) as the recurve bow
It would be good to see you put these through a Chronograph to check arrow velocity they're not expensive it gives a better indication of Arrow power rather than simple draw weight. https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ballistic-Premium-Precision-Chronograph-Bullet-Arrow-Velocity-Bullet-Shooting/401734660278?hash=item5d894070b6:g:o80AAOSwgGNcQDrM
I’m doing everything you did yet I still can not get it to work, what can I do?
Arjun se achha nai chala skta kya bolte ho?
i made one of these. it works really well. now i'm thinking i might make an automatic crossbow.
Next how to make the arrows without heat and power tools please  PS: Thank you for the Video
What if I used for full size fiberglass rods instead of cutting shorter ones
Recurve bows do shoot harder then other types
No power tools, no heat, no shirt... Just my powerful, beautiful narcissist self ...
What is "driveway marker"? I've never heard that.
Awesome bro
that was really fast
Is this about your muscles or bow?
Nice idea and nice target
Nice hunky arms my dude.
It was more like $20 for me at Home Depot, because they didnt sell any pvc less than 10ft, but Ive made like 20 of these bows and their pretty good. The paracord stretches over time, so maybe try something else
Medieval archers shot the arrow on the right side of the bow. Also back quivers were invented by hollywood.
How do the fibreglass rods stay in?
Any substitute of the fiberglass pipe?
Not Bad
What are that yellow thin sticks?
The compound bow you made could of shot harder only because if you used the other strings it would shoot farther
Anyone know links to the items?
Might I ask where did you get those driveway markers
Omg you are soo fucking handsome
I get schedule 40 PBS but its thin walled
Your  vidio is pervect thaks👍
Nice really nice .
My first ZNA vid... wow I haven’t missed a single vid since
The bow industry is very easy ... and all of YouTube did not find anyone talking about the industry arrow! If you tell us how the workmanship of the arrow ?!
i think the recurve bow will give a snap when it launch thats why the arrow go deeper...just as i think...me too didnt study about that ... \(*o*  )/
What knot is he using at 2:37?
I don’t know if you do but if you keep it on you should take your strings off
I hate the splinters too but making a long bow is still a lot harder than this
With the bow that a fan sent how do you get that cool shape??
Are there any alternatives for the fiberglass rods? I can't seem to find them from where I am now😅
The heavier the bow, the heavier the arrow weight....you wouldn't shoot a. 50 cal round with the amount of grain of a 9mm now would you?
Ok done learning how to make a diy cabin made from pallets, done watching building your own forge from nothing. Now too build a bow and arrow. Now im ready for the apocalypse. Koodos
Can we use something else besides driveway makers
Hahaha I can  relate to the stuition🤣
Mister Robin Hood why are you making stuff now?
The recurve bow has the radius on each end that gives it much more spring.In a way like a adding a turbo to a car with the factory engine..
Or just buy 50$ metal bow..
I always lost in race when its P.E.   Now I made a bow.  Well see who will be last now.
Nice video! Do you need to undo the rope when you are done to avoid the bow structure from bending over time? (I am a full noob in archery)
Hey peeps, can anyone tell me where to get fiberglass rods?
Very cheap and very danger
The recurved limb tips on your bow allows more energy to be released because the recurve allows for more leverage thus allowing more energy to be stored and released than a traditional straight bow. And as the bow is drawn the cord actually lifts off the recurved limb, this causes the bow to behave as if it’s getting larger.
How to make an arrow
Damn, I wish I had a hot bod like you.
Where do you buy all of this stuff from?
Two questions. Firstly, where did you get the bows or make them? Secondly, can you feel HUMANS with this beauty? There's a lot of people I need to kill.
@znaproductions what state is responsible for this weather
What's the diameter of the fiberglass?
the one you were given is recurved turkish bow better then any bow this shape gives this energy.
I don,t know what is fiber glass?please explane where is purchesing fiber glass
And arrow
How to make 45 pound bow
Love the info! Really good job young  man and I appreciate your thoroughness. I Just subscribed. Please post a video when you figure out an inexpensive recurve. If memory serves me correctly the Huns conquered a vast area using them from horseback
Way to flex on us

dude thats cool
What are the arrows made off? Please tell me, or at least an alternative material to make one. Thanks
How do you do the arrow
Fucking chads
you said in the video it cost about 10 dollers can you show me the sites you can buy the things you will need ??
I just wanted to thank you so much and excellent video of course ! With help from you and the backyard Bowyer my brother and I built one of your PVC fiberglass Rod bows one night and shot them three years ago and we still shoot them in extreme cold weather because we don't want to take our good girls out in the cold love the bow it shoots great it'll start you on a new Road happy shooting!
I'm from Australia and we dont have fiberglass drive way markers is thier something else I could use
I know this is an older video, but wanted to leave a comment. You are correct about the recurve shape being superior to the regular long bow despite the draw weight difference. But if you would like to get more out of the long bow, on reason that your arrow did not penetrate deeper  could be either the arrow weight or spine. If the bow is pulling at 70, you should be shooting a 340 spine at a minimum of 350 grains of total weight. Anything less than that and you loose Kinetic Energy through arrow flexion. over longer distance, the wobble (archer's paradox) will stop and flatten out, but until it does you are loosing KE.   Kinetic Energy in archery is measured by:   KE = (arrow speed at distance)^2 (arrow weight in grains) / 450,240  if you can get a chronometer and get an average speed of the bow, you can tinker with various arrow weights. It is super fascinating stuff.
YES
Make one
please tell me all material list
(1) http://www.manchuarchery.org/bows (2) https://youtu.be/O2ynNV3UW28  This article (2) should help explain why the recurve does better at converting potential energy to kinetic energy for the arrow. This is a specific case for the Chinese Manchu Bow, but it should shed some light. The video (2) is a direct comparison by Armin Himmer on a horse bow versus a longbow.   I think it's a trade off between simplicity and effectives versus complexity and efficiency.   Love the build btw! Keep it up!
What material do you use to make the ARROW?
I request you to make a fishing bow please
Việt Nam điểm danh
the recurve accellerates faster. since the arrow is so light, both bows will be able to accelerate it to the maximum speed of the limbs. a heavier arrow will travel more slowly in the lower weight bow and at a certain point the inability of the recurve bow to overcome inertia will result in speeds lower than the 75lbr even though the stronger bow is slower during dry fire. good bowhunters tailor thier bow/ arrows weight and use different combos for different game/ranges.  if making your own bow, something is better than nothing but certain designs will always out preform others. crossbows>compound>recurve>flatbow>longbow.  materials used also have different properties. some wood may have good compression properties and make strong bows but may not be a fast to return as others. laminating is easy with a table saw and yeilds good results.  or just buy a 100$ chinese bow off amazon. i can attest that they can be quite good.
How can you not pull back a 75lb bow? You look ripped. I barely have any muscle and can easily pull 75lbs for days
I thought eli was fat, I guess not
How many LBS the weight sir..?
Good shit.
Can’t believe this is 3 years old
You are now the green arrow
Our man is ready for the apocalypse
why  is the fiber glass nesessary
What is that yellow sticks u kept in PVC
That recurve bow's name is Turkish bow. It is the most eficient battle bow in history.
what can i used instead of fiberglass driveway markers?
1:27
Dude, you're a natural for youtubing. It wouldn't matter what the topic was, you're just good at it.
Who’s watchin this in 2k19??
Those survival skills, congrats.
Who is this guy that keeps interrupting you, esse?
You are like a super hero esse!
Great video! found u by accident. Please can you tell me how long would the pvc bow last for if u used it every day? and do u have any videos on how to make arrows? thankyou shaz
And then when society collapses, imagine getting killed by someone wielding a bow that they built according to your own tutorial
My name is Isaak I am gonna be stranded on a island for 3 years and 1 in Hong Kong and one in Russia when I get back I’m gonna be a masked vigilante and save my city
I want the list of tools you used in making this
can someone plese tell me the measurements in centimeters?
How do you shoot? that way is new to me
Love the vid my friend new sub!
This is cool.  Is there a tutorial on how to make an arrow?  These look as though they could probably be used in self defense as well if you lived in a country that banned guns...
Everyone out here trying to be the Vigilante
Thank you bro its so interesting when I can I will attempt to make a bow using your advice and things to do it ie fibre glass stuff etc thanks bro great video very informative PEACE...
How da fuc do u make the arrows
wow awesome
@ZNA Productions how am i gonna put inside and let the fiberglass stay inside the pvc?
Rule of thumb make a fist place bottom of fist against the belly of the bow extend thumb if it's the exact distance of the bottom of your hand to the tip of your thumb it is a safe tension
Cool bro well done
recurve bows have the tips curving forward, causing it to have a shorter draw and draw weight but it also makes the arrows fly faster because the ends shoot forward faster than a normal longbow, which as i said, results in a shorter bow with much less draw weight but the same or even better power than some longbows.
1:15, you live in california dont ya
A 45lb recurve is plenty to hunt just about anything in North America with a well placed shot. I shoot a 650gr arrow in mine and it blew completely through my deer last September. She ran about 40 yards and piled up. Freezer=full. I also have a 58# reflex deflex longbow that hunt with on occasion. I shoot an 800gr arrow out of that baby....it's kinda scary the penetrating power that combination has even at only 150fps. I did the math. An 800 arrow at 150fps is getting the same momentum as a 400gr arrow traveling 300fps....which would be a pretty juiced up compound. Both are at 0.533 slugs of momentum.
Good stuff dude ..... really good 🤔.
Can you pls make a list of needed things couse didnt understand Everything
how do you make arrows?
Recurved bow were made to be use on horseback and they go much faster with less draw weight that 45 draw is a long bow 70 in term of speed and damge
Your a good shot
I used to make bows. But then I got an arrow to the knee.
Ahh. A ZNA classic.
I wonder how the highway markers do not fly out of the PVC pipe, since you did not fix them inside the pipe :-/
Jason Brody from loss Angels
Recurves were made for horseback
I feel like he's gonna start another crusade from under the FBI nose
Fiberglass alternatives??
Recurve bows are indeed much more efficient, the Turks and mongols used them for thier bow cavalary and slightly larger recurve bows for thier standard archer units, they were the biggest empire in history so i do indeed think that proves the efficiency of recurve bows
Anyone else having a problem with getting it to shoot straight?
I am in the process of making a pvc bow i am  trying to use minimal tools but i want to make it more powerful i am going to use round pvc pipe try to cable back it and put driveway markers in it i was also thinking of trying to use attach exercise bands to it somehow I know that it would just come out looking like one big extremely crudely put  together monstrosity and that the exercise bands seem a bit like cheating but it would still have a string and still function like a bow but round pvc pipe is not the best tool for bow making and that it would already make a bow that functions more like a giant slingshot and less like an actual bow.

UATEKYOKUDOU *Dragons destroy targets, flip table and knock down fence*
how to make arrow?
Can I get a bow
The recurve bow stores more energy. Due to the limbs arching forward
Bro I think the arrows were hitting the wall and that’s why the last two bows were similar in penetration
Just awesome.
Can I buy one 😱
Bow in Anglo Saxon is shoulder ! ...
Can anyone tell me the Products needed Please Reply early
Could one of these take out an animal
Thats why the best archers in history.. turks and mongols used the recurve short bows..
This was when you were good
Like your data, interested in how the recurve is done and all about. Love to see measurements and details on your heavyweight. Great job!
i cant really understand your voice all that well what where the measures of the pvc?
Damn right I can do what I want...........I'm wearing gloves...and the recurve is easy......ish.....heat gun and coffee can (medium size or whatever curve you want) and blam. You get it..
Look up the Mongolian recurve bow.
That is Effing clever...putting the markers staggered INSIDE the pvc pipe.  Well played!
I enjoyed your entire video and I'm happy to see that there are young men out there being creative rather than playing video games.
This is so COOOOL!
Moar bow
Is the bow you made in the video strong enough to hunt with? If so up to what kind of animal. Thanks
I will pay you
Please make one for me
A recurve bow stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than the equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow.
no safety disclaimer or how this can be fatal. terrible video with no regard to children
I need a bow like this!!! Can any one give me??? For money??
Make recurve bow!!!!!!!!!
hey relax today's 22 DEC  enjoy vacation , BTW I liked this video plsake more and 🎅🎅merry Christmas🎅🎅
You have failed this city!
Nice work sir
How you mack aroow ???
man this guy's archery level 100
Recurves were designed to be faster and shorter . which makes them easier to maneuver. But they are less forgiving.
It's like a longbow because of the length.
Enough        To kill 23 zombies   I will save whole world
Cool now I can shoot my teacher in the throat tomorrow
You should make a auto-firing Cranking crossbow, a smaller version of the weapon used by the Dwarves used in the Hobbit: Battle of the five armies!
Whats the weird thing he does with his arm after firing the arrow??? Like a gymnast after landing a move?? Loose the vest aswel mate......
What's the wall thickness on that PVC pipe?
Great Video, love that curved bow
How can you hit the like button again on this video? Very helpful
Pull the recurve till it bends
Definitely make that recurve bow
I hope you’re still monitoring your feed. Where do you find fiberglass rods cheap?
hi,we can hunt pigs with this?
If you are living in a country without "highway markers", look for "stakes for plants" or "plant props". Metric dimensions: 140 cm (length), 8 cm (diameter).  For the Germans out there: look for "Pflanzstäbe". BayWa online shop has them.
you are so cute
How long do the driveway markers need to be?
THAT RECURVE BOW IS SIMILAR TO WHAT MONGOLIANS USED.
Hanzo
You are using penetration to "weight" the bows? Try using a scale.
What are these yellow bars? I am from Germany and did not understand that
Okay so will that bow hunt deer? Will it make a clean fast kill?
I Don't understand the part of the second knot, can someone explain me ?
Im trying to put the bow string on but the paracord will not stay in place. ive filed the grooves in even deeper and they still wont stay in place. im really aggravated lol
what kind of knot do I use and how do i make it
I guess when u drawback a recurve the string of the bow is getting longer, which makes it works as if it was a longer bow. And when released the string gets shorter as the arrow is accelerating and the energy transfer to the now shorter string makes the string straighten out faster than what it would be. So the trick here is to pull longer to store the same amount of energy as a heavier bow.
Wow man that is good ilike this
Different bow styles accelerate the arrow in different ways.  The recurve bow fires an arrow with the evenest distribution of velocity, longbow fires with most of the acceleration first and the least when the arrow is released, and the compound bow or pully bow fires an arrow with the least at full draw and most at arrow release. All of it is a preference to the archer or situation, each affecting range, accuracy, ballistics etc.
Goodbye squirrels. Your welcome avocado tree.
is the 20 lbs bow capable of confirmed kills with animals such as deer elk and maybe bears if not what does the trick
Odd question but what kind of knots do you use for the paracord. They obviously must be pretty strong to support a bow
The recurve bows give you more leverage
Hi, I want to make one of these but am unsure on the diameter of fibreglass rods I would need. I Can’t find ‘driveway markers’ like that for sale in the UK after looking online.  Thanks, great vid!
Amazing video! Thank you!!
!!!  u are the man !
What arrows did you use? Was the para cord pulled tight enough to knock arrows regularly?
Hey brother-I hope your head is better! I have TBI/Disabled Vet, it bites! I have alwats been back and forth-longbow, crossbow. Crossbow I can buy one of 2 lengths, already ready for everything but the broadheads, whatever. The longbow seems to be just like the compound bows-so how the hell do they know the length to cut!  I'm 6' with a 52'' chest, does that mean I need longer arrows/ a longer bow?  Oh, if you ever get a chance, having had Judo and Akido before the military really helped me. Then I took what I had learned and went with Bruce Lee's way of Jeet Kune Do-which really basically breaks it all down to skip the katas and use what moves you can do the very best. Kept me alive also working 2 prisons and 2 jails! Stay cool! Mike
You realize you're teaching how to make a lethal weapon?
Awesome, thank you
The recurve bow is almost always better in every scenario, the subscriber who gave you that bow should start taking over the videos.
The arrow is waaaay too weak. That makes it fly erratically resulting in less penetration with the 70# bow.
Absolutely love a recurve please need link to video making recurve
Did you ever make the recurve bow? When I was shopping around for bows I settled on a recurve because it has as much power in a shorter length than a long bow. It's really great. It has to do with the "flick" and the fact that it really is "as long" but just bends back the other way making it shorter.
Gadha
thats a muscular boi
That recurve is legit-
Great video bro
the recurved bow is a quiet advances tech u have to know that made in wod it would mean to tie the string the oposite side of the natural bow curve so it has a quiet interesting pullie effect if u like bows u should have known...
I vote make the recurve
He watch ghost ninja
Was that a release aid?
Nice job my friend. You are a very skill boy.
Can you please tell me the materials you used...... I need to make a bow...... There's some sort of eerie happening in our town.... Please......
Oh cool so nice......thanks
He should have used 72" rods
How did i get here
good
OhMG! I love how powerful it is. <3
The recurve increases the length of the bow as it opens up giving you a faster shot with same draw weight. I'm just curious , did you modify your arrows to fit the paracord ?
This video has 5 million views. I wonder how many have been murdered by a bow made with the help of this video.
I enjoyed the bows that you showed I'm going to try and make one thank you
This guy looks pretty buff
Where do I get arrows?
How much did the saw cost? And the shed to protect me from the rain? And those gloves to protect my head? How much did that measuring tape cost, I don't have one of those. All of this comes up to be less than 15 bucks?
What is the recurve bow made out of? :O
Can you hunt deer with this
DADDY STRONG
recurve bow is more efficient
Where did u get the arrows
These bows work better as a fibreglass single rod and then only using the PVC for the grip about 1/3rd the total length. You can get fibreglass electric fencing rods and small wire clamps that attach to them for the ends to attach the string.  Full length PVC blows up after its a few years old and exposed to some sun, becomes very brittle. The flying shards are dangerous to eyes, I got the fastest and safest bows from fibreglass full length bow with a 1/3rd middle PVC grip.
Wait what type of parachord
I love the bloopers at the end.
Was that necessary. Cheaper then buying one from a store.
you should renamed it "Survival post-apocalypse bow " :)))
Can you pls wright what did you use, for me its hard to understand what you say and i dont know how to spell that haha
Cute😎😁😜
I subscribed, you're a brilliant kid, keep up the good work. Thanks
My first bow was one made of 1,5 cm thick Bamboo, it was pretty good but when i grew increasingly stronger i pulled more and the bow broke, i tried doing it with PVC too but same result. SO then i figured i had a good plan, so i took a pvc pipe and of about 3cm wide and grew the bamboo inside the pipe to make sure it was a perfect fit, the bow in total got about 35 pounds of draw weight. it was pretty fun to use and it also sufficed in downing some flying rats (pigeons). Fun times it was to be young and worryless :q.
1.9K dislike? From IDIOTS or know it all.
Can you send the bow and arrow
Hey, I just wanna video bomb your video....😆🤪🤣 again...
LIKE A BOSS! BOOOORRRRAAAAWWWWW!!!
I think the curves on each end of the recurve bow gives the extra power and velocity
How long do you think these bows should last?
This is JUST like the king of random video which I made it from!☺
What type of pvc pipe is he using (the brand)
Arrow spine is factor.
Makes bows yet knows nothing on the physics of them other than draw weight
Loved it kiddo. Wish u all the best........
what type of cord are you using?
Hmm
Compact long curve MONSTER
From which material u made an arrows ?
haha! loved the ending
Where I live driveway markers are about $10. each. 80# bow over $80. you can buy a used one for about that.
This is very very interesting. Thanks.
Cool bud dude. I like the fact that you making things cheep, and quickly that have a real purpose. What about Arrows?
The recurved limbs on a recurve bow are designed to "whip" the string, giving the arrow alot more speed. And the 5-7 procent you are missing out of the "monster bow" are crucial, adding those extra inches will increase the speed and impact alot
Damn he got dem muscles
Yes, recurve bows do wonders for penetration velocity
was the guy towards the end looking for smoke? lmfao
Next make a diy arrows i know that this is a long long time video and i watch this a long time ago.
The only problem is the users strength
Is there anything that can be used to replace the fibre glass rods?
The huns (5th century warlike people that defeated the romans many times) used that bow with the curved ends. It gives the arrow more velocity with less draw weight than a regular bow. It gave them a hyge advantage over their enemies who used regular bows
Very cool!
I though he said no tools
I like compound bows ive a 65 and a 70
The recurve launches the arrow faster because the curves throw more inertia in the launch ! As if been told
Arrow weight has a lot to do with power of the bow
Man that was an INTERESTING video, i actually may try and make one. Thanks for the info. 👍👍
Great vid.
I shoot bow compound bows. But you are actually pulling 7 to 8 pounds when you pull it back. It's just the base of the bow is halding
what you called the yellow sticks?
What kinda rope did u use
Why were yall whispering.
98% of these comments need to end in that's what she said.
You should explain when using your bows why you shoot them at a slight slant
What is lenght of PVC
Awesome
Can you please list me material needed
used to make pvc bows when i was kid, hunted alot of things with it, nice vid
well my friend is in the hospital
I Am Indian please give me
Not a pvc bow
With the powerful bow just need a different technique for drawing, watch english/Welsh longbow tutorials specifically how they kind of step inside the bow and push it forward into the point of aim.
The higher the draw weight the slower the speed. The first law of thermal dynamics is energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be converted to another form. It has to do with mass and time.   A power lifter cannot throw a punch as fast as a non muscular person, the closer the boxer is from a bag the slower the punch even though he is twice as strong. It’s basic physics.  The limited time allowed for the limbs to transfer energy to the string and to the arrow doesn’t allow maximum speed to be generated.  Another factor it is because kinetic energy is lost due arrow flex. This is energy being converted to other invisible forms. Remember energy is released in the forms of heat, light, sound. Although we cannot sense that energy it is happening. Also air resistance is always attempting to slow the arrow and as gravity pulls it to the ground.
What would be an alternative to PVC? Since it tends to crack in cold weather.
A recurve bow is smaller and has the same draw weight as a longbow
That highway markers is fully maked with fibreglass? No metal?
Does anyone else thinks he looks like a lesbian
The reason your heaviest bow didn't penetrate very deep is it entered the target at an angle due to paradox of the arrow. With the correct arrow it will bury itself deeper than the rest.
Your face is just like a hero I like your face

A recurve bow makes more power from a shorter bow, for example a horse bow.
I made mine today this is badass thanks for helping me out really appreciate it
Thanks zna i am 15 and i made one for me and my 8 year old nephew we like yhe diy pvc bows
Can someone tell me what is the drive way markers diameter?
i cant flatten my pvc even though its squishy idk why prob because of my wood placement so im gonna make this instead of those horse bows :/
you really should coverup that insulation if you spend time breathing in that garage. really unhealthy
Don't shoot from.left shoot from right
90 degree? water boils at 100 degree. You would be deaed at that temperature

How to make arrows
I want to build this and I know you use 3/4 inch pvc but how thick should the outside of the pvc pipe be. I was looking and the thinner ones were rated at 200 psi and the thicker one were rated at 480 psi. Which one should I get ?
aur ye arrow kaise bnaye hai
bhai pvc pipe ke under yellow stick kya hai
Is one of your parents Japanese or Chinese
Can i replace the fiberglass with something else?
A material list would be nice. I heard the pipe is 3/4 inch thick? That is just 1.9 cm!
Can i use bamboo to replace fiberglass.
Cool. I didn't see in the comments so my apologies if this is a repeat. What about modding the heaviest bow to resemble a Japanese long bow rather than an English long bow? The grip on the Japanese bow is about 1/3 of the bow length from the bottom rather than in the middle. Apparently reduces bow vibration and increases accuracy, although also requires different firing technique because  it is also harder to draw than from the middle. Fun to research anyway.
For free
I also need a bow
What can i use instead of the fiberglass driveway markers? thin bamboo stalks? plastic tent rods? cane?...
Migraine boi
this is which string
What are the yellow things?
the recurve bow has more power for lesser weight because the bow was initially bent in the opposite direction before adding the strings.

What's the best string to use?
can you make me one?
Think slingshot about the recurve. It does sling the arrow.
Impressive
My first PVC bow-making efforts involved stuffing the PVC full of fiberglass rods; it increased the draw weight tremendously, but decreased the power of the bow.  Eventually I realized that increased draw weight doesn't help unless it increases acceleration of the arrow, so let's look at what interferes with acceleration.  The bow I built had two major defects: all the fiberglass rods led to internal friction and movement -- wasted energy -- and the sheer mass of the fiberglass towards the ends of the bow worked against acceleration.  (acceleration = force / mass, so higher mass means lower acceleration; and the worst place to put that mass is the part of the bow that has to move the fastest.)  On top of that, the maximum acceleration of the bow is limited by whichever material returns to its original shape more slowly, PVC or fiberglass; it becomes a worst of both worlds situation.  So it makes sense to me that your bow with the heaviest draw weight is not providing the penetration you were expecting: sure you're putting a lot more energy into drawing the bow, but the bow isn't giving that energy back efficiently.
POWERFUL Bow, 35 pound draw wight...
if we dont have highway markers, what to use instead ???
you should join the olympics bro
What is the UK equivalent of highway markers?
It’s not just the draw weight at full draw, but the force throughout the entire travel of the  movement of the string. That’s why a compound bow works.
you didnt tell us how long the string should be
What string u use for that bow ??
The main reason the Japanese are running with a wet spaghetti in their bags is not because Islam is the one that causes world terror in Alaska and this the main reason that anyone who wants an archery like this does not necessarily indicate that he is the son of the first cannibal created on Earth.  I am sure -100% with this.!!! ✌️😳✌️😳✌️😳
Cool as F##k mate.
Woooow
hmm so thats how you make a pbc bow
Well I wasnt able to read all coments, but the simple explanation is  that a recurve saves more  "power" per pull-lenght, because its a not linear spring. That means endpullforce doesen't matter. If you have a small up, in 1/2 way pull you have a bit more force in the middel-pull lenght, lets say 3/4 of endpullforce. But at 100% Pull lengt you have 4/4 pull force.  Its the  amount of stored energy per pull, that is higher on a recurve designe. Just simpel mechanics.
So what's to keep the rods from sliding out of the pipe? Is there supposed to be a cap on either end?
Please tell in hindi
the highway markers could probably used for makeshift arrows/projectiles as well.
What r those yello stuf
I dis agree.  35lbs was the sweet spot for Indians and all bows past history.  35lb will take any animal.     google is written by Reptilian angels they HATE truth.      45lb bows are GARBAGE they waaaaaaay too stiff.  it ruins everything.    read:      *INDIAN ARTIFACTS Yahweh SPEAKS:*  STOP LYING 2 OUR CHILDREN.   Those artifacts are Indian and some alien. The early Indians were the Israelites drifters of Moses time, so, those ( humans) are never more then about 6,500 years old. Satan chased  most of God's people into USA. Jeremiah hid th Ark of th covenant in South Ohio.      SWORDS: All metallurgy was controlled only by Lucifer to keep humans dumbed down, oppressed.          The violent Indians were aliens = fallen angels & co.  survivors of Atlantis& Lemuria& etc. If u think a human made many of those arrowheads, try it. Try making1.  But then many humans 2day are demons placed in wombs. Lucifer erases their memories.              Do a little research how cement is made. all fossils were from the Noah flood. Satan lies about there age. Note, in Noahs day there was no sun, so, all fossils are mostly ferns& such. Noah never saw rain.  A mist would come up nights from below.            Cement is made thru exclusion of oxygen. Same happens with tons of mud, silt. Threason they were always stone age is bcuz Lucifer oppressed them.           Also, the ONE ONLY  reason technology exploded 1900 is bcuz Lucifer has 2 Enforce is RFID mark. He will be jailed &so must kill all his breeding stock. Which he eats thru horrific torture.   Those fossils aren't 5 million years ago. Thsolar system was heaven once. Lucifer was breeding neanderthal&dinasaurs when Yahweh built Eden. That is why Eden was fenced&guarded. Satan told us thdinos were in America's only. Thfossils u find wr only produced during Noahs flood. Mud produces quick cement.    Earth was not created in Genesis era. It was re created then, rather re plenished. That's why Bible say earth BECAME formless and waste.       Read book INTERVIEW WITH THE DEVIL Sherry Shriner     Yahweh CREATOR reveals *HISTORY of our SOLAR SYSTEM.*     *see link          ThMost High has a team of elite cutting edge warriors on earth. I work with them where it comes 2 a tip. I have been allowed 2listen in when Yahweh speaks from the throne, we have also been interviewing lucifer.          Lucifer has a mind eraser, downloader. He clones people he murders.           Ofcourse u bring up other issues. Lucifer can down load u 2become a violinist if u sell your soul. He used 2 advertise with sell outs. Anymore, he just kills u if u sign out.            Here is a useful copy and paste I wrote 4other video, teaching how to build quartz weapon of Yah. Yahweh also revealed history of our solar system, who Reptilian are, etc.:        "Yahweh explained 2me Giza is His. Fallen angels produce all these videos that lie 2our children. 2find fallen angels You Tube, follow thpopularity trail. Follow the money trail. They are very skilled charming producers. They possess an obvious over riding void however. They never mention Yahweh legitimately if at all. Dinasaurs, endless question marks, & "leave that 4u 2decide" are their trademarks. Just 2give u an idea, behind thscenes, they literally tie up humans they can manage 2acquire &torture them while family members are forced2 watch. Texas hurricane, Yah informed us these angels kidnapped& are killing 50,000 people. Government is them. It is not your friend. FEMA is them.            If u see someone on TV with a camera pointed@ them now, it's1 of them.            Yahweh is about2 produce a world wide sign now, then He will remove His light off th earth. &pole flip& Lucifer's RFID reign will begin. It will be a time horrific beyond imagination. Hence a quartz energy weapon is required (orgoneblasters) (Google HOW TO MAKE)          Lucifer built all the other pyramids to mock Giza.. 4 example, in 1988 I was becoming worlds best guitarist. Lucifer stood up 12 guys 2try 2replace me. Lucifer hates having2 inspire u with music. But will when cornered. Music now primarily only points2 Lucifer by design. If it is inspiring at all. Yahweh stated recently "Lucifer enjoyed destroying thspirits of all those who adored him."  Truthers videos You  Tube typically do exactly that extinguishing your spiritual light. Claiming Noah built Giza. Again2 make a biblical connection seem ridiculous.            GIZA:          Giza is like a stamp. It is the creators mark& says "Earth is mine." Garden of Eden was just beside it &is under Gulf Aden now.                Eden was fenced& guarded bcuz Lucifer had dinasaurs in USA @that time when land mass joined. &there were Neanderthals Lucifer made 2promote evolution.            Basically thsolar system was heaven once. Yahweh had 12 direct children, each child had a planet. Lucifer was Lords elder brother. God created 2 warrior girls when Lucifer, then HALAYEL, began 2fall. These 2 live now on earth as warriors promoting a weapon all humans are required now2 build. Yahweh provides instructions orgoneblasters website.             After thwar with Lucifer, our 14 planets were laid waste. Lucifer's planet became our asteroid belt.              The angels secured Pleiades, Mercury, &thSun. Yahweh's throne is in thSun. Pleiadians u SEE,  are devils mocking angels. Lucifer retreated2 Orion. &tried 2re build thsystem. Yahweh then stationed near Eden, created Adam, Lilith who joined Satan &so Eve was then created.             Giza does not have Egyptian writings inside. It has Yahweh's instead &a camera verified it was built by thHebrew God.              Giza cannot be entered by humans however. Yahweh recently created multi dimensional creatures2 guard Antarcticas angelic artifacts. Same with Giza.            Giza is a portal& has a king &a queen chamber inside.            Solomon used2 command demons2 aid in building 4 him. Yahweh employs them also. 4xample Lucifer has been annointed2 enforce thRFID mark of thbeast. Lucifer has told us he will go door2 door 6 months to a year. If u receive that mark it's a ticket 2hell. Hide during that time.          Yahweh is about2 flip earth's poles. Then RFID chip enforce will begin. It will clean earth of evil people.          Giza was white with a gold top. Thsame all seeing eye Lucifer has u thinking is the height of illuminati evil.            Giza originally had a winged lion in front. Lucifer mocks it with his Sphinx.           Yahweh's 2warrior daughters are about 2leave earth within days.. Shazzerazi, &Rashayel. Shazzerazi has a you tube channel where she is known as Sherry Shriner.          When u see satanically educational "truthers vids" videos  or any unjustice u can simply elicit Yahweh that an angel destroy the you tube channel. They will be glad 2do so. Make sure you address your prayer in God's sons name. You Tube doesn't monitor You Tube. Yahweh overrides all.          (Lucifer influenced half the Bible his name isn't Jesus. It's Yahushua. They used2 call him Yasha in heaven.)        God is not in your churches.        "Lead my people back to ME."          If u watching this video u want truth. Ask creator2 give u truth in all things. Example, Yahweh has been revealing HISTORY OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM..        https://sherryshriner.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-awakening-part-4-b-interview-with.html?m=1      Yahweh has an " RFID" also. It's babtism. Even Yasha got babtized. If u have not received thcreators mark, He cannot help u when Lucifer's forces come for u.        Truthers vids 2day are like  pulling a rapist pants down &exposing how his penis works. Where is talk of a solution? Or how aliens fit into CREATION? Where is mention of Yahweh? Mention of weapons 2defend ourselves???? Yahweh has provided a multi dimensional quartz weapon. You are required 2build it.        Winged Reptilian are Fallen Angels. Yahweh turned Lucifer &his angels into reptiles when he mated with Adams wife.             These videos leave us with an doctorate in Satanism and our children are left with graphic images.         If we continue only exposing truth in absence of pointing 2God as solution that void makes us not much better then a Satanist.         https://youtu.be/zjjUldMA-dg
Nice
Mando bem pena que não entendo nada do que ele fala.
I can hunt a deer with the first one?
This is amazing. Gotta make my own now.
I really want to know the recurve one, please?
Click bait thumbnail
holly şit
The extra flexion of the recurve add speed to the arrow upon release since you are storing energy in the tip and deformation of the recurve and in the tension you put on the string which allows it to come out faster and in this instance speed equals power
Just made mine and it looks and works fantastic! Thanks a ton for the tutorial.
where the vids my dude
Can we use such type of pvc bow for hunting?
Are you using a quick release or just three fingers?
Problem is that a plumber may tell you, PVC creates it's own heat upon bending. Enough to crack and shatter if it's used even twice. (You could use it once or a hundred times, doesn't mean it won't happen if it hasn't yet)
Great video thanks
You get greater pull  the bow looks short but if you measure it's is longer  = more power.
IF U WANT TO TEST THE BOW WITH UR THROW AWAY TOOL make the stay still even if they got shot at or shoot all of them in the center of the box
Half the time I was just looking at your muscles lol @znaprodutions
i just gotta say, i just found this channel today, and im inspired. thank you
What if you use a 5 foot 1/2in pipe inside a 4 foot 3/4in, no fibergass rods? The bow will shot faster as the 1/2 in pipe acts like as light weight lever. Its similar to tapered limbs, gets thinner towards the tips.
dude that is awesome!!! cool bow!
I wath bow pls esy
Recurve bow help alot if it shorten the string in the end whene shooting. Juste like the tention on a pulley bow in the last moment whene shooting. It give that extra kick in the ass with the same weight
It's very useful.
Imagine the English Yew longbow of the middle ages! Those things had a pull of 120lb or more! Considering people were much smaller then, archers were almost deformed, with the huge shoulder muscles from pulling those.
Very cool!!
90° haha you should come to Elpaso
What spine were you using for the arrow? If you have a weak spine arrow for a 70lbs bow it is pointless. You should use a 400 or maybe 340spine for 70lbs
Thank you for this video, I had made a bow out of pvc and used a heat gun but it lacks the nessecary rigidity. The fiberglass parking markers are perfect. I might make arrows out of them too, w duct tape fetching. Not sure what to use for the arrow heads tho. Possibly for sale by themselves. Anyway, cheers!
What knot was used to make the bow? I've made two of these but I can't find the knot.
Second time watching this in about two years Good Job on it
What dimensions are the fibreglass rods?
where do you get the fiberglass from
I am curious about buying one of the recurve bows like you subscriber sent you. Do you have a link for them so I might buy one like that?
I want to know how to make the recurve.
Very good. I'm impressed, which is very hard to do.
awesome! now i will embark on a silent rampage. hopefully a vigilante will save the city from me.
What are the three yellow sticks can you please reply the name as I am not able to understand it in the video
Does anyone know the diameter of the fiberglass rods he uses?
How long of the driveway markers
That recurve tho
If you heat the ends then you should then be able to flatten and bend them
fuk ye (and hes kinda cute)
I dont think i could use shoe lace for the string help me now i just want to make one😢
big body what’s yo build boy
Pagal
Where do the rods disappear to at 2:19?? They're there and then they're gone as soon as you start talking about duct tape.
I'll bet the guy who made the recurve bow for you was happy to find out that while it was not the heaviest weight bow you tested, it performed just as well at 30# draw weight less. That's significant and very interesting.
I subscribe and I made a PBC Bowl
Where did you get the string for the bow?
How long is each of your fiberglass rods?
very impressed.  wait now til information is banned... bows, slings, knives etc... the list hasn't an end to it.  raw materials along with good knowledge is paramount.
good
you should make a video on how to make cheap arrows
A simple bow works by rapidly releasing the stored energy, due to tension, in an elastically stressed curve when the drawn string is released. A recurve bow has three curves under tension when drawn, each of which releases the elastic deformation upon it faster than a bow made of the same material with only one curve. Therefore while the amount of stored energy is the same in both a single curved and recurve bow of the same draw weight, the recurve bow is able to release that energy faster and hence increase the ballistic performance of the test arrow.
Nice. I'm making one.
Awesome it is interesting
Why is this vid not monetized?
thank you that is hat i need
Great, interesting video, thanks for that. As to the curved bow characteristics see - https://youtu.be/6lf9q6OQse0?t=2m54s for info on why there is added value to the curve. Evidently, it acts as a level. Who knew?!?
the fiber glass rods are the most important thing but where can you legit find them? I want some one to go to home depot or Lowe's and actually film them finding them there
Notches you didnt mention the measurement?pvc you did mention 5ft
wanna buy that bow. u selling? Im truly looking to by a bow from ya
Did he get a nail?
Why is he shooting a long bow with a release??
Really cool!
You are a talented and smart young manm. Great video
Could you write down the materail size and spelling of matwrail in description please
Recurve tips are there for a reason, and it is to give the arrow an extra "push" when the arrow leaves the string. And that a recurve tip has energi/power "stored" without tensioning the arc. Think of an Asian composite arc that curls like a C when unstrung, so you can imagine how much enegi is already stored in the arches before stretching the arc.   So the shape of the arc has everything to do how the arrow will leave the string.
That Turkish bow, the most efficient bow of all time
what kind and measures of the barrel is that my audio is very bad
Very interesting. I love when you go in depth with details and info.
you're hilarious! keep making your videos and yes do a recurve bow. i want to know why!
I respect you so much!
Where do you buy the drive away marker?
*Only watches video to see his arms*
I works
I got an even cheaper version that I made up myself if you don’t have pvc! Take an old curtain pole, and separate it so it’s shorter. Then bend it as shown in this video and put string on the ends! I made it with this method and it’s super sturdy and free for me since I already had the stuff? It’s also easy to bend in this way as well!!! You guys should try it!
Dude that's awesome stuff blows my mind how easy it is to make with hand tools as expecting a lot more work.
We need to talk about Kevin
Ohh shit your biceps are bigger than my fucking future Jesus
This is a Special Forces Engineer in the making right here.  Bro, you got your shit together.  $$$$
My theory about the diference between the power of the two bows is: eve tho the bow you made is harder to pul and has much power the curvature that the bow from your subscriber it helps at impulsing the arrow with less power from you needed and if you add more power it can go even deeper. Dunno :/ that's just my theory :D
Hey zna! Could you plz try making a video on those recurve bow??
I know... 2015 video but i have to ask. How is the durability?
He's a lil baby in this
Thats syk bro
A just have a question what is name of that yolow things ?
bbc bow
A nice Bow and arrow and i love
Make a video how to make the power full arrow
The recurve reduces draw weight while keeping the power the same but at a shorter distance the longbow will reach farther but the recurve won't
Cool bows
A recurve bow translates the draw weight more efficiently as it imparts its energy over the full period of the release. It is still accelerating the arrow when the longbow is starting to decelerate as it straightens out. It does not initially accelerate the arrow as fast as a longbow but releases more of its energy into the arrow when it is already in motion. Basically the same HP,  but the recurve has a second gear.
i am not gay or anything but i gotta say that thumbnail is sexy af
I made one when I was 9 using a stick and some shoe string
Please tell
I'm watching this so I can be a vigilante
Please list the materials her and their measurements too
I'd say that sounds like weather in the summer in South Carolina
how to make a bow string??
It's a great bow... Can you please tell me which material is that string made of???
glad you didn't miss any shots and shoot one of your neightbor's.
Thanks I made my first bow with the help of this video. not exactly the same way, but kind of... great vid!
Can anyone give me am idea on what brand of pipe and parachute cord I should use.
Is it possible to make a notch to line up the arrow or add a sight to this kind of bow.
Super smart!  Thanks for sharing.
You look like a fucboi with that tank
what type of pvc?
anybody know where in the UK to get fiberglass rods for pretty cheap (around 60 inch)
1:20 did you just say 90 degrees is burning you so much you can’t even go outside XD
How long are the driveway markers ?
What a range of this bow? I will wating your answer.pls tell me
Видимо у  них уроков труда нету! Они не знают шо такэ "тиски". Но видос хорош, thanks!
Awesome video
Fiberglass alternative ?
Ty
Can I get fiberglass rod in England can if been to builders places and that have never heard of them? Are they online America?
Does anyone now what you need because I can't really hear him properly I've got bad hearing
The recurve does launch faster than a long bow. It has to do with the angle of the bowstring and the force. You just get better acceleration from the recurve
Is it just me or did you hit a bullseye on like every shot with no aim
Really interesting when you got to the part on the curved bow, certainly wasn't expecting that! (y)
How long of an arrow? For the bow made in this video
YOU are a very goo teacher!!
i've made a water pipe pvc bow 73 inches long with 4 full length 6 ft. fiberglass driveway markers.
So this is where The King of Random got it from...   *Read more*
THE KING OF RANDOM DID THE EXACT SAME THING AND THEY DIDNT GIVE CREDIT
the king of random kinda just did this exact video smh these people must not watch your amazing videos and they didn't give credit
what were that yellow rods can you please tell me
You dont think about the arrow. The 70lb bow would do better with a heavier arrow, and it looks is slower than the recurve, and the speed of the arrow is lower than in the recurve bow. 70 lb is like driving in the third speed, recurve is like driving in the fourth... The thickness of the bow makes it slower.
great video congrats
He go sub to me channel as I am subbed to you for a year or two
Bruh ur good at everything
That recurve bow is gangster.. How do you make one
I think the knot is an overhand loop knot, for anyone wondering
Hey I am trying to make a bow for kids in the elementary  level grades 1-5th grade. How much fiber glass can I use so the draw weight can range from 10lbs -20 lbs?
I would love see how to make that pretty curved bow.
good
Buff Light Yagami (from the live action)
Well I think it may be that the curve helps maintaining the angle at a full 90 degrees between bow and the string a little bit longer, So the forces are fully used, while in the normal bow the angles varies between 35 to 120 degres or so
nice tool for a camping,, can use the pipe as a stick, bat, bow, hanger. you are good.
can I buy one ?
The perfect stealth weapon when America collapses and hunting libtards will be legal. Can't wait!
Just finished making it. Works amazingly, a huge improvement from my old homemade bow. Thanks so much for the video!
very cool
The more powerful bow needs a longer distance to gain speed to penetrate....idiot
does it matter if the driveway markers are fiberglass
Archery increased to 85
Will the bow last along time or will it break
Can any one tell me what is that yellow sticks..??
El arco mas fuerte no tiene mas penetracion que el anterior por que a pesar de tener una mayor energia potencial almacenada solo le trasmite una cantidad similar a la que le trasmite el otro arco por que el arco fuerte a pesar de estar mas tensionado que el otro se cierra con una velocidad similar. Solución: usa una flecha mas pesada. (Use an a hevier arrow in de stronguest bow)
Where did you buy the fiber glass at?
Recurves really are more powerful and fast.
hanzo main
Show me a willow tree and I'll make you one for free Kemosabe
Did you do a video on the bow with the spools on it?
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT  a release with a longbow?
Fuck you are a muscleboi
What length of arrows do you use for this?
What length of arrows should I get?
thank u bro.🙂👍✌️
I just realized how freaking ripped you are in this
Bro please tell me what i could use instead of the fibre glass markers ?cuz in my country its too hard for us to find em..
75 Lb ? Wau, increible!
rust in a nutshell
i think the main benefit from a recurve bow is the weight difference
Good job to videos
Great  video! Question.  What kind of Paracord did you use? I know they come in different thickness.
Good videos, mate. Keep it up.
with weather like that, you could swear he lived in Colorado
how tomake a arrow
can i use a fiberglass tube? or its necessary the fiberglass be rod.
I believe the recurve bow has less draw weight and a higher leverage than the others.
The recurve adds speed to the release.
Read the book "man powered weapons and ammunation". If your monsterbow is heavier than recurvebow, it may happen that even bigger draw weights you get lower velocity. You should try that penetration test with heavier arrow to see the difference.
Can nylon cord be used? Pls reply
Lol this guy is a beast. Cool. Stick around him if the zombies come lol no but for real
How did you make the arrows?
Thanks Dude!  What's the size and the thickness of the FG rods?
A re-curve bow  has higher power at a lower draw weight do to the fact that the curve allows the archer to draw the string back will increasing leverage and still get the same amount of power as a standard longbow
helpful vid
yee
I know this video is old pro enfants runs videos
Does anyone know how long are the driveway markers
can i use a tent rod? it made of fiberglass too
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yesssssssss brooooooooooooooooo
I prefer my Martin.
I love the bow! You did great! And ahhh those muscles tho ☺️
Thanks bro. Plz Make That recurve  Bow out of wood. I'm waiting to watch you do it.
Suggestion on how to draw a bow and not wear your arm out and get max draw easily on the more powerful bow. Bring the bow above your head and hold the line with the arrow near your face and then as you bring the bow to level for firing, you stretch your arm out so you are pushing the bow away from you. Less fatigue means more times to fire the bows and the max power from the bows you use.
thanks for this video I want to make hundreds  of these home made powerful bow to give free to all of my manpower to fight thieves
Thanks bro i did it so thanks😉😉👍👍👌👌👏👏👏🎓🎓🎓
whats fiberglass alternatives ?
Can you just put another PVC pipe in the bow to make it the same as fiberglass
Nice
Thank you it works well
Not me, I won't get violent. I'll just buy the bow an get away with hunting fresh meat and fishing. Hey don't hold it against me fish just don't want to sacrifice themselves to my plate. This will teach them. Thank You Loader.
can I use garter as a string?
Why are you using a wrist release with a recurve/long bow?
How to make the arrows
Thanks bro...
How to know its a 75 pound??ZNA Productions
The out-takes were very funny.
Real American Ninja, nice.
Nice video
Nice video
Wats that yellow sticks
I remember you! You used to make shields out of street signs and all sorts of cool stuff!
1:34 what it the name of that stick
you are lvl 35 in archery like me 😖😢😢😢        i need to be better :P
U are nice
How do you make the monster bow? How is the core oriented?
Tq friend
Super bro I like this
Way back before the beard lol
Someone help I live in surat Gujarat can't find a fibreglass stick below 15$ per unit  what should I do I really want to make this bow. Is there anything else I can use instead the fibreglass stick? Please reply
length and diameter of driveway marker/fibreglass rod?
You were just a baby!!!
Now I need a spear, food and water and I am ready for the zombie apocalypse
now i can be a  vigilante
When you wanna be katniss so bad
This is the first video i realized this dude is ripped as hell
I used to make these things when  I was 9
so making this
Any better string to use for more of a spring
fun fact recurve bows have as much force as longbows and the longest arrow ever fired was from a recurve bow ;)
Another great vid! But maybe you could try to come to terms with fiberglass. It has served you well.
Can we use pvc pipe as bow and tree strong one branch as arrow
He looks like a nerd but would kill us.in a sec
0:26 u should use flex tape
for the stronger bow you need a bit heavier arrow (heavier front edge)..the curved bow you recieved is perfectly working with your arrows..
What are you using to shoot the arrow on your hand?
Recurve Bows are smaller than an English longbow but are just as powerful and Recurve bows  are able to be used in mounted archery
Very simple and very good rather than others thanks
Dude, that wasn’t boring at all that’s actually a very interesting phenomenon and totally worth doing a video on or at least putting it into another vid as a side comment or note...cool video though too I’m definitely making one of these now, thanks!
Which pic you are using
write down these items and tools plz. and where i can find them..?
Dis boi pastier than toothpaste. LOL
ZNA Productions , I made a bow out of 1/2" PVC piping, and it is 5 feet long when strung, about 5' 4" when not strung. I haven't weighed it, but my uncle took it and weighed it and said it was 55 pounds of draw weight, so it makes sense that the 1/4" PVC piping draws about 35. I wonder if the PVC bows are always like that. They have a 20 pound draw weight gap every 1/4 or 1/2 inch. Interesting.
i didnt want to walk in on you r video again lol bombs the video again
I really want that subscriber bow it looks so cool
damm dude didnt realize you were jacked
Prince of Dew sent me
Ha my pistol crossbow has an 80lb draw
And bending it to put the string in the other notch is the most dangerous part since the pvc could shatter and send large slivers of pvc into your leg.
Sorry but your bow is stupid and dangerous , since the pvc could shatter while using it and while bending it to put the string into the other side of the notch.
His arms in the thumbnail tho
Nice DIY BOW
I wonder if the weight of the arrow had something to do with the two bows showing similar results.  While I can see making a PVC bow as usueful I'm not sure I want to have it as a long-term zombie weapon.   I've seen PVC get brittle and shatter without the force of a string bending it-kind of suck to 'need' that deer meat and your bow comes apart or to 'need' to put a zombies eye out and have the same issue.
And -------- foot
The pvc pipe is ------- inch
How do make arrows
wow
My name is Oliver Queen. For five years I was stranded on an island with only one goal: survive...
👍thx
Look up NU and learn how to shoot and stop making DIY bow videos using garbage materials that are going to cause injuries.
You got some nice shoulders man ;)
How rage have this bow;
Hungarians and Magyars used recurve/composite bows for a reason. They work extremely well, are shorter for horseback, easier to use (lower draw for comparable power to longer bows), but they certainly were not cheap back in the day, they were considered state of the art and sometimes took months to make thanks to glues and other supplies like horn.  I just made of these PVC bows, and I did a recurve and thick fiberglass hybrid, and man, it is stupidly powerful! Love the video, and I enjoyed this project as much as the people enjoyed staring at me in Home Depot carrying around the driveway markers and huge PVC pipe.  Safe to say, they knew what I was doing with that stuff, haha.
Which things u put in PVC pipe
Jest ktoś z polski który mógł by mi wyjaścić co to są te żółte patyczki
Can I hunt a deer with 40lb homemade pvc bow
You can also stick small peace of PVC as guide to the center of bow through which arrows can pass, can work as an excellent guide and you wont need to wear gloves.
He has nice fore arms I don’t know why he just does
Where to get fiberglass rods?
A recurve bow could shoot faster than a longbow while not being fully draw. If you want to get more power out of the longbow, you’d have to draw it further which you aren’t doing. If i’m wrong please correct me that would be wonderful.
The notch requires power (My energy)  :V
lookin jacked bruhhhhhhhh
But good videos
Your release is so crap
Velocity doesn't always equal greater penetration. But it does dump more energy
Could u tell me the names what u used in this video..
Mmmm not understanding
What’s the thickness of the carbon fibre rods?
any substitute for fiber glass rod
please give me the name of the tools you used in this video
I learned how to make the recurve bow in 11th grade design class. Fun times. We also made a crossbow but it only had a draw weight of like 15lbs.
Still begging for cash?
You could also try to file a notch for the arrow
I will make this bow in my house
I made one exactly like yours and its so amazing. Honestly the hardest part was getting the string length perfect
The Native American Indians used the bow and arrow to hunt the hunters not the wildlife

My sister in law says you are better looking than Rob Snyder.
Superb...
This is super-great! I've been looking for a way to make a LARPing bow with a max draw of 35 pounds, and this video provided everything I needed! I never imagined it could be so easy. Thank you!
how to do the arrows??
Use shorter but thicker pipe and you'll have your light arrows penetrate deeper. Consider using shorter arrows too or pull the cord to the max. The curved Mongolian bow is probably the best. The longbow is nice but not really close to the curved, speaking of penetration. Well done though! True fan of archery there!
Awesome
Recurve bows work more efficiently because as the bow fires, the curve increases the speed of the line by decreasing the  length of the line significantly faster than traditional bows. Watch a slow motion of a recurve bow and you should see the effect
You say $15 but I spent 28 on all these things and they where all on sale. But it did turnout with a draw back of 76 pounds.
Thanks for a better apocalypse tomorrow 😂 👁‍🗨
SOY
Hey man nice video. You could include some amazon affiliate links in the description with the materials to make some extra.  ;)
I have that
Nice archery
What is this yellow thing?
Turkish bow ftw 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Recurve Bows FTW
Those driveway markers would make good arrows.
What is the thing that he put in the PVC
can i use a regular square file?
You guys are a cute couple.
Damn that’s a good looking human.
what are the fibre glass rods called, and their dimensions ?  any links for more info about them ?
Great job
What if you want a prop bow
Bro this did not work for me the i dont kno the knot and i tued a bowline onot and then it just kept comin out of the knotches this did not work for me man this sucks. Money down the drain
my cousin made one like 75 lb only the center is a wooden foundation
Honestly seemed like he was hating on the recurve because it was better than his. Bitter
Could you tell me the size of the fiberflass rods in milimeters? I really liked your video. Those bows are badass.
For the peices that you put inside the pvc could i use bamboo for that or nah?
Lol I I already broke both that I made
Gough would be proud
can u show how to make the recurve bow
Just drill a hole in the bow on each end and put paracord in it
The rationale behind the limbs “re-curving” away from the archer at the tips is so that the very ends of the limbs can be accelerated faster than the rest of the limb – this results in energy being transferred more efficiently. Ultimately this results in faster arrow speeds and improved accuracy on the target.
What are those yellow sticks where can I get them
Many thanks just getting in to bow making
Lol you didnt know that a recurve was meant to be faster compact and be stronger with a lighter draw weight? Come on man bow knowledge 101
No try make a joke. Can i kill a boar using it? Of course hit to the head is KO. I mean the body.  Just curious.
How long is the PVC Pipe and The Fiberglass?
You are correct. Recurves and compounds were designed to allow a weaker bow to fire arrows at speeds that could match that of larger, more powerful bows. so basically...   They're like the archers TV remote. Designed with comfort and laziness in mind. Well, compounds are anyway.
Gunna try n Mek one today thanks for info n that bro got my pvc just got washing line for string hope it works
Recurves are easier to pull back but that few inches your not drawing back can make a huge difference
Amazing Video
Really good done Love My friends

Driveway markers: are they easy to find?
“Who’s watching in 2018?”
heck
8 driveway markers in a recurve bow?
Kill
how long of an arrow do you have to use
The recurve adds power by allowing a greater lever force to be achieved.
lb??
Interestingly, European medieval longbows with an estimated draw weight of 150-160 lb were recovered from the wreck of a warship. Before that discovery, 90-110 lbs was believed to be the maximum draw weight used on a heavy bow. No wonder medieval archers suffered from warped upper bodies.
A re-curve bow gives you a lower draw weight, without sacrificing too much power.
what knot is the loop?
Great video thanks. If you find out let know. 😀
nice
Recurve retains power with less draw weight and smaller size - the power comes from the recurved tips that help launch it - longest bow shot in the world was done with a recurve
What Song???
1st person I've seen shooting trad bows with a mechanical release.  That's how I shoot too, perfect release everytime!!
Mongol bows were often recurve AND reflex -- they were basically just a C when unstrung, and stringing turned them into a D. The other way to increase power, is to make the bow longer.  This is what the English did.   Also, a flat core is more efficient than a round one. Your recurve is deflex, which makes it safer to string, out not as powerful as it would be if it were reflex.
you are really good with a bow! this guy is someone i do not want to get into a bow fight with
The recurve bow shoots the arrow faster.
what was the knot that he used
if you use clear tape or some kind of tape on the fiberglass before you cut it.., it will prevent splintering. you build that recurved bow yet....?
what can i use instead of driveway markers that are more available? I live in saudi arabia so i i need more mainstream items that I can get here...
the recurve bow is stronger because of how the string bounces on it
Just made the 35lbs pull bow , was very helpful video . can you please do an arrow video including multiple arrow heads , would help a bunch .
Nice work dude. The driveway markers are very costly and are rare in our location. Can you give me an alternate for it and no change in effect. Thank you.
Nice work dude. The driveway markers are very costly and are rare in our location. Can you give me an alternate for it and no change in effect. Thank you.
I believe a lightweight arrow flex more at launch not creating as much velocity absorbing some of the power/speed
Can you name the materials you use?
who was the guy walked in in the end
Yes, a recurve will move the arrow faster at the same weight as a longbow.
This is awesome!
I didn't add any fiberglass rods or anything and the draw weight was 40lbs 🤔🤔🤔is it Gud?
If only he could see what is going on with his life this year
Should I should someone with this
After how many shots is the bow gonna bend if you don't use those fiberglas rods.  Congrats on 1 mil
Who's watching in 2018 ???????????????????????????????????????????
Youngboi
I trekked into the forest with my self and a shoelace. I found  a river white a few swans. By there I found a ash tree and made a homemade bow
yes it is necessary
This guy is a blacksmith in another realm
The best part of this video was watching you learn something new. Very nice seeing that very moment and sharing it with us.
Eli from 3 years ago looks so weird compared to 2018 Eli
This is pretty uninteresting, but if you have a foot or longer piece of PVC, you can purse your and vibrate lips and blow like you're blowing a trumpet and it will make a pretty powerful sound. Of course it won't travel as far as an actual horn because it lacks the resonance and bell projection, but it's handy in dire situations.
hi! it was amazing video.....
you can use duct tape, spoons, and, dowels to make arrows that are surprisingly efficient and remarkably cheap
Muscle boi
Can you show us how to make the knot it wasn't really showed up close an I'm not a boy scout or a sailor. Or I could look up a video if I knew the name of the knot used. Thanks.
How long is the PVC pipe and radius please ?
Even the best duck tape only lasts about 10 shots
When you use a bow try and change arms because if you don’t you’re going to have muscle imbalances in your shoulder and back.
How do you determine the draw weight of a bow?
Does the string hit your arm at all and if not what’s the length between the part of the bow u hold and the string?How long is the pvc pipe in meters
ok i have a bow... how do i make arrows? or should i buy them?
1. The arrow drops VERY quickly from this bow, and it has a tendency to shoot to one side 2. Somehow my bow ended up being 50 pounds with 3 rods... Illuminati fucking confirmed
So young fresh-faced in this lol
This is really working thanks ZNA Productions
wikipedia says about the recurve  bow being much efficient. :)
Those fiberglass driveway markers are pure evil. I swear. You touch em wrong and then your hands are full of fiberglass shards.
I tried to make one, but soon learned that it doesn't work if the piece of pvc is to short🤔
I subscribed!
I'm just curious are you gay
Watch grant Thompson
Wear a mask or you'll heck up your lungs on the fiberglass
the point of a recurve bow is that as you draw it back the limbs unfold and become easier to pull, rather than the weight of the bow just stacking up as you draw it.
U'r very handsome bro
I didn't understand what the yellow bars are made of????
recurve bow has much more penetrating power at the cost of the same power you put into drawing it :) that's why it was the superweapon until guns came into picture
A recurve is designed to give you the power and draw length of a log bow in a more compact package
The string slaps the arms of the recurve bow and slings the arrow forward?
Nice Bow!! I made one too and it works pretty good. It has a 33 lbs drawweight. Maybe I try the recurvebow too?!
how do you increase the power of the bow?
very good you are smart
If you research the mongolian or korean bow you will find that they us a tip form much as you have on the recurve, and it does indeed fling em further and faster with less draw weight and length.
Oh great, Trump is gonna ban all PVC pipes now...
Review apartment cut beauty extremely own decline envelope isolate exciting meal grow.
Good video. Yup.
How much the fiber rod diameter
Does adding more fiberglass rods make a bow more powerful?Thanks!
They loop is the key your question
It is not boring, I subbed bcoz of this video. Good job.
So after you string it the fiber glass stays in position?
Cool
Is there a way to get around using those driveway markers? They don't seem to be that easy to find here in the UK...
brilliant!
Omg wtf this is so cool! xD
How easy is it to nock arrows onto the paracord string? I am sort of afraid that the paracord may be too thicc.
this subscriber bow you can pull it more than yours
recurve adds what is basicly tiny little bows and adds pull resistance at the end
When do you breathing?
Been wracking my brain to do this. Ta. I have been giving araldite some thought, for the recurve.
Do you think that a smaller and thinner PVC tube can be used inside the barrel to substitute the yellow sticks?
How long should the fiber glass be
awhh fetus eli
Is it okay if your notches went through the pvc?
Damn, that's got some snap to it.
(Insert arrow joke here)
This might be a stupid question, but when shooting with these bows how do you compensate for the archers paradox of the arrow having to go around the bow when aiming.
I shall become...the Black Arrow! *Black is my favorite color*
i just watched we need to talk about kevin
What is taht yellow colours stics plz tell me the name
I think you put the arrow a bit too high up. The recurve was obviously more centered when you shot it. If its not in the middle when you shoot you wouldn't be using the bows full potential right? I could be wrong and too stoned tho 😂
The recurve adds arrow speed and power with a lower draw weight, but they never reached popularity when they were invented (medieval times) because of the amount of time and effort that went into making just one bow
Pvc recurve with fiberglass core?  O.o XD
3:26 😍
i am taking lessons at heartlands archery and you dont even need to look for so long and you practiclly hit a bullsiy and im sorry for my spelling
WHAT A DORK. PVC PIPE. SMH.  NATURES BOW N ARROW. POSER. GOOGLE VAGINA
Look , maybe I'm not an expert , but to me a recurve bow, it's like a 1 1/2 bow in one, meaning that , the adding of an additional curve to both end tips of the main bow , adds more power to the draw, in other words the ''little'' ''bows'' at the tips , bend first , then it's the turn of the ''main' bow, so to speak , at release you'll get ,first,  the little ones , then the main one , the adding forces are of course greater in the end. Et voila !!  a ''recurve bow !
A recurve will outperform a longbow with the same draw weight.
Great for hunting
made this today and i love it, my first ever bow (now all i need to learn is how to aim correctly)
Soo what can i use to replace the fiber glass
What is the thickness of the pvc and length of the driveway markers?
unstring them they lose their power like that
What is the material used in side the pvc?
my bow may not pull pounds, but it can pull bitches
You should keep your hand steady when you release.
Loved the ending...lol
That actually looks pretty powerful
Suggest Thread tu use
The monster bow is considered a long bow Wich shoots closer but if you shoot farther away then you have to rainbow shoot it with decreases the power but with recurves they are made for both long and close shots
The recurve bow gets closer to full draw-weight at smaller draw-lengths and then evens out toward the end of the draw. That means that a high draw weight is applied to the arrow for longer. If you remember F=ma (force equals mass times acceleration), that means that the arrow is accelerating quickly for longer meaning that it will reach a higher speed. Just a heads-up, this is about to get kind of complicated. If you like pictures, check out this slideshow, and then come back if you want my explanation:https://www.slideshare.net/ManoharMHegde/design-of-limb-of-a-takedown-recurve-bow  For more practical analysis, kinetic engery (KE≈1/2mv²  Kinetic energy approximately equals half the mass times the square of the velocity) is usually used. And the energy of a full draw is measured PE=F*d (Potential energy equals force times distance.)  You might have noticed I said PE instead of KE: I'll come back to that. Basically, you could come up with the "Draw Energy"  of the bow (I just made that up) by pulling the string back a half-inch, or an inch at a time and measuring the force at each distance. Then, you would multiply each force with the distance it was measured at, and add up the products. (The smaller increments you use, the more accurate your measurement will be, it just depends on how much time you want to spend.) When you let go of the string, you release the energy in the bow, and it converts to kinetic energy following the rules I mentioned at the beginning (that's why, for the string, we measure PE).
Good aplicatif Bow and pratice...
hell u people are putting this guy down u mite need to no this shit one day im a big fan of the long bow in a pich this shit will do the job
Can u please tell me the equipments required for making this Bow
does PVC pipe is strong to hold the arrow? ....... what are the materials did you use in making that bow?
How did you make a arrow
If you want to start archery, do yourself  a favour and go to a shooting ranges. They will have good bows and also your technic wouldn't be that crappy.  If there is no range near by buy one instead of building one. (Probably a Semick Sage or a SF Axiom)
I really LOVE this method!! Thanks so much!!!
No offense but you should really grip the bow less, bend your left arm abit more, relax your shoulders and stop punching the release. Slightly and slowly ease on the trigger, its meant to be a surprise. Not being mean just giving you some constructive criticism.
Sorry for my ignorance and poor knowledge in English; but what is the yellow coloured rod he cutting in 1:28?
any alternative for fiber glass rods????
You couldnt miss if u wanted
very good and informative video.  I will make a random comment and guess why the recurve bow is better.  It's more efficient being lighter towards the ends.  Also look at the angle of the string vs the bow when drawn, I bet the travel of the recurve is farther as it releases and the lightness overall equal higher efficiency equal higher velocity.  It's gotta be the higher velocity regardless of draw weight.
what was that yellow rod made off.?
Nice and save my city for the bad guys
Very interesting! Nice job!
I don't suppose you mention anywhere what you put in those cardboard box targets? They seem quite effective.
The recurve kicks ass.
Nice
will i need a little ledge type add on so the arrow can rest while aiming?
The recurve bow is interesting for me to. I think the reason is that the 2 curves cause the draw force to act on the arrow for a longer period of time .
Have you tried slapping water to make it easier to draw the bow. 4:49
I’m really interested in a recurve one
stupid music
Great video bud
Hanzo intensifies
what is that in your hand to hold and relese
Handy to know,the book of Eli
Sweet idea! 👌
If you're not fully drawing the string you won't get the full force of the bow into your shot.
The recurve basically acts like gears, so takes up the slack string and pulls harder against the arrow at the start of the travel.
how to make arrow
There is a really great documentary series called 'Weapons that made Britain' that focuses on iconic weapons from medieval history. One of them focuses on the longbow and they go in depth into the advantages of recurving a bow. I'll link to it below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR0wssl9fWo
Can it kill a person?¿?
That hot profile pic tho
short answer, the design of the recurve allows for more initial pull weight than the long bow, storing more energy per inch of draw.
Make a bow out of an Osage log and I'll be impressed
That roblox music tho
kool.shit...man
1:20 i bet mother nature was on her period.
First video I’ve seen on your channel… Pretty impressed with it so I subscribed.
Very cool man! One little tip I recommend to keep the fiberglass needles from coming out when cutting the rod, is to give it a couple wraps of electrical tape and cut over the tape. Really saves your hands! lol
Well I would think with the recurved bow the prongs on the ends when pulled back and fired would give you more flick, there for generating more power but I don’t know
Cool
Dumm da dumm dumm dummmmmm
Wicked video, enjoyed. Have you tried using different types of strings to see how the arrow reacts? I have an antique bow and thought about having someone make me a string for it. Or can I use what you use? TY
can u use carbon fiber instead of glass because i cant get glass fiber driveway marker in the netherland. any other resources that i can use keep upthe good work
Those Biceps though
Holy shit  man I remember being here a month after this came out :0 haha you were hardly past 200k and now you're verified with one mil! Congrats bro keep up the great work :D
What should be the size of bow and arrow?
How did you make arrow?
Love your style man, quick and dirty. Brand new to archery, feel lucky to have found this.
What's an alternative for fiber glass rods?
wow thats amazing!
who else here thinks this guy is hot? 😁
can you use sth other than fiberglass
Why the fiber?
Why does he use a compound clip release instead of a tab or a glove.
Where to buy arrow pls suggest...n how did u buy your arrow
What's the material n sizes of pvc size etc..all that pls mention that
Pls tell me the complete process for making this bow & complete specifications as well
I want to make sure I get the right PVC what should I Wright in to get the right one.
The recurve bow hold the strings at the exact point of launch, which makes the arrow retains more momentum.
I Made this bow and Im really surprised by the amount of power it has, 100% works!
you should check how north asia make bows. small but fastest draw
What material is that bow
28 inches is draw lenght on all recurve and long bows.  Have to use 29 1/2 in arrows.
I'll keep that in mind bro.nice one
how to make arrows
how long a re the driveway markers, 48 inches?
Anyone else have the problem of destringing when firing? Im going to experiment with different types of knots to see if that makes a difference.
Now im the green arrow😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
I likely shouldn't say this because it's made of pvc for 10 dollars but it draws and shoots well so... Beautiful bow! Well done lol
i'd like to learn how to make a recurve bow
Your recure bow curves more and when u let go it goes strait a lot hader plz tell my coment on vid
I have been hit by my fletchings more times than I would like to say
Recurve bow launches arrow faster. More power with less draw weight
You look mega-cool firing off arrows!
Eating fried peanuts will increase curves as well as recurves so its basically about curves
How do the highway markers not slide out???
Reall man, these r terrible instructions, how long is rope, how long are the driveway markers I have no idea.
Cool
why'd you use a release for a long bow?
Are you shooting with a release
You should make an arrow style bow
Draw the 70lb bow by laying down, putting your feet on both sides of the arrow, then draw the string and fire.
If you notice the recurve bow, once it’s pulled back it’s gives a certain flick once released
yo its not called a "pully bow" its called a compound bow not hating love your chanle just kinda anoys me because i do archery XD
How much shorter do the fiberglass rods need to be compared to the length of the pvc. I would like to build a longbow.
Cool. Damn thing works pretty well.
I've seen a video where someone built a crossbow using the leaf spring of a truck. They didn't say what the draw weight was, but it must've been at least 3 digits. There were even failed attempts to draw it back.
Are that can i use for hunting
You know, I needed a project that I can do as a hobby (non-electronic).  I think I'll start by making a bow.  Having said that, where do I get all the material?  I mean, I have the saw, the tape ruler, and a filer, but where do I get that plastic and fiber thing?  Do I just go to Home Depo?
35 pound draw weight is that powerful but it's still good
What was the diameter of the fibreglass???
What kind of loop did you use
Recurve bow is made to be an almost a "fling forward farther and faster." It was meant to be compact and easy to fire but they aren't hard to fire
Vetovastus ei kerro kuinka nopeasti nuoli menee, jos keula reagoi hitaasti! Olen myös kokeillut monia muotoja, eikä aina aina 40lbs takaa, että nuoli kovaa. Tärkeintä on kevään nopea reaktio.  Jos jousi on yhtäjaksoinen ja raskas koko matkan ajan, se saa kevään reagoida hitaasti. Vihjeiden tulisi olla kevyempiä ja nopeampia reagoida.
where do i buy those fiberglass rods? im looking to make a couple of these for me and my brother. also, you used regular 550lb paracord, right?
The steps and to the point, awesome video!!!
Yes a recurve bow is more powerful but easier to draw thanks to the re-curving of the bow. Because Science lol
please tell me the materials name
I liked my own comment :)
Wow I'm going to watch this vid a copy it so I can get subs lel jk ur the lel
What is the size of the PVC pipe
The recurve launches the arrow faster because of the way it is curved.
thank you for making this video I was going to by a recurve bot they are real pricey these days and now that I saw this video I am now making my own thank you
Hey Have you make video on bow that uses 8 fiber glass rod if you have plz copy link in reply Thanks in Advance
My name is KARTER, will you make me one of the fiberglass bows
I wish I could learn how to shoot but I have to buy a bow first though Im thinking about doing this...btw I bet you live in Indiana that is totally typical Indiana style weather lol
Cool video he should team up with Legolas and Hawkeye together ✌🏻👊🏻👍🏹🏹
Or use a stick and a plant for the rope
To my understanding, the recurve is a way of shortening the overall spacial length of the bow while maintaining the power of a long bow. It's like the bow is longer without actually being longer. Why would you want a shorter bow? For one, it makes horseback archery significantly easier, but on a more practical level, it gives you better mobility in the tightness of dense forests, lessening the likelihood of snagging your bow and making noise that would scare your prey.
My first ZNA vid that I've watched
Yes maybe the recurve gives that extra "flick", making it more efficient? Excellent videos!
The green arrow i am so excited
Holy shit, I think I know where you live.
Smart little kiddo
you only need 3 inches to kill
This dude feels really real, personality wise...
Can I use the "Easy, Cheap, Deadly: Homemade hunting arrows" with this bow?
Everything is amazing except please tell us the length of the PVC pipe and the length of the string. You did not explain how long the string should be for power and flexibility.
Your technique is pretty weird. You use no accesories on the bow but you use a release. Why?
4:05 bow can u make a tutorial?
Nice video, however that's not how you test the draw weight of your bow. First you need to know the draw distance for each one of them 24 inch, 26, etc. Knowing that, you need a tiller, which is very easy to make, look it up, you put the bow on it, and draw it to  draw distance with a bow scale, a device that measures the weight directly. The  number displayed by the scale is the draw weight.  You're correct, the recurves on a bow add more poundage for a set bow length, like you said, the end of the bow snap back further, increasing arrow speed. Is a trademark of horse archers, being  on a horse you can't wield a huge bow, the back of the horse and the saddle get in the way, so by having recurves on your bow, you get a more powerful one in a smaller dimension.
The longbow pull stacks up -- string pressure falls off rapidly after the string is released.  The recurve has a flatter pull-pressure curve and so continues to accellerate the arrow longer -- as different parts of the bow bend at different pressures.
The reason why the recurve bow is more powerful is because if it did not have the curves at the ends it of course would be a regular bow but the bow is already strong and powerful but since the curves are there it adds stopping power witch is about an extra fifteen pounds of pleasure but since it dose have those curves at the end the bow strings tighten up making it mor powerful
nice video , keep them coming.
Regarding your penetration test: Aside from the mechanical advantage of the recurve bow, it looks like you have a bow tuning issue. As you see in your video, the arrow flexes as it comes out of the bow, and also came out at an angle. Arrows always flex. But if properly tuned, they should come out flexing left and right, and horizontally straight.  Anyway, if an arrow hits the target while flying slightly sideways, penetration is massively reduced.
İ did this when i 12... An  arrow(long iron skewers) bounce back and stuck the door behind me then i never shoot from it again pvc is dangerous
I want some help
Nice
Jesus hell Your arms are muscular In that thumbnail!
I made this boe today for 10$ and this is amazing tutorial
Thumbnail makes you look hotter,like  From a 6.5 to a solid 8
I think you should test penetrating power on about 50 meters  or 50 yards,  then the arrow have stabilized more.
Awesome
A standard English longbow from the war of the roses had a draw weight of at least 110lb
sorfry bruh but ur techniques hurt ma eyes xD no hate love ur vids
All ok, but your follow through is bad!
Is this leafy's brother
This is a good bow but I think the video was mainly just to show off how swole he is
Dude needs a harbor freight carpenter 6in vice
it harness energy
Hey, I'm planning to make this to myself. How would I do the fiberglass part with 4 rods? One long on centered?
GGG is making bows now?
75 pounds was a standard longbow in medieval times. The curve gives a higher velocity to the arrow, but loses it faster. At end course a longbow equiped welsh archer's arrow was able to pin a mailed knight on his horse, piercing mail, leg, bone and horse flesh before stopping.
I know you must have alot of comments but heres my question: How would you put toghether a non pulley pvc bow pulling about 25-30 pounds of draw weight and still have good durability? I'm a larper and bows I make are either too powerfull and would hurt someone (despite the safe arrows) or too weak and break or bend after a few shots.  Thanks in advance, your tutorials have been very helpfull!
Brilliant. And the earth is flat. And Jesus is King.
Well, given that the arrow is light, the power/weight ratio is too big. You need to have a good ballance in order to ge maximum effect from your bow.
Love your vids man... Good stuff!!!!  Ever made or thought about making a go kart????
He's just tryin to flex on us.. XD
Would regular arrows (from like Walmart) work with the Paracord draw string?
Thanks... I'm gonna go shoot some birds!
Not boring.
Nice ...but this bow won't look at good when I'm sitting in $500 dollars of camo on a $250 dollar stand over the $300 food plot.  So I'll have to Stick with my $700 pse so I feel better about not killing shit and being out done with a $10 bow. Neat video good job
what do you use as arrows?
You should mention that you need a wrist protector the bows power can leave a mark and really hurt
Probably just better transfers the energy
i watched it, i think the tip is hittignthe board at the back, unless thtis hittignt he back of the box, meanignti needs antoehr high force to get through,  ie  10 pound per penetration, then 1 pound per inch of friction (exaggerations_
It's not a mystery about the heavier bow by adding so much more material you have effectively reduced the flexibility of the bow while you made it stronger you also slowed its reaction time down which means your arrows don't fly as fast
It's not about the maximum force, it's actually a function of the force (pounds) times the time it's at that force. For the monster bow, the force increases at about the same rate relative to how far you pull it, but with the recurve bow, it reaches the full force much earlier and keeps it much farther into the draw. So even though the MAXIMUM value of force will be the same, the area under the force curve(the integral of the force function) is going to lead to a higher final velocity of the arrow.   If this still doesn't help, think about being in your car. Your monster bow will slowly push the pedal Down farther and farther all the way to the floor for 10 seconds. But your recurve bow stomps on the gas right from the beginning  Hope this helps!
Ever heard about turkish bow? What is it in your hands is a turkish bow:)
Damn you're jacked man
Great !!!!!!!!
It's because you hit the wood behind the target so the arrow stopped
What kind of cord do you use for the bow?
Hanson main
Hy you look strong but those earrings makes you look like a g*y plz don't wear them bro... I told u that becoz I care
Purely on this video you have another subscriber
most definitely interested in that re-curve. i have my grandpa's ol' bamboo re-curve he used back in the day to hunt with and its a lovely shot.   Dig your channel man. i <3 making fun tools and weapons at home and will totally use some of your techniques in my future builds.
Works very well but do know that as of the end of September from Lowes, the cost was $35
what is your favorite bow you've made?
His arms. oof
Thanks
So a recurve bow penetrates as much as me
Sometimes when you fire the bows you made.the way you fire it is wrong,thats whats giving it poor results resulting in weak power and penetration
Your bow is longer as a recurve.
Funny I have everything I need already at my house. Strange I have exactly 3 driveway rods laying around. Meant to be
like plus sub I love that subs bow look freaking cool
Your a fantastic shot I'm jealous
Im building one for my bug out bag
He has so much potential
Bow face
Lol
You don't really need the PVC, right? You can get away with making a bow out of just the driveway markers?
isn't pvc fragile and breaks easy?
does any one think you could put caps on the end so that the bow doesn't have to be permanently strung but not have the highway markers fall out while stored
which string is used for the bow? and pls make a video to make an arrow.
You should practice drawing the bow by using only the upper back muscles, and not your biceps. Your back muscles are much stronger than your arms (which allows you to handle heavier draw weights), and you will still have your shoulder and elbow joints in the next 5-10 years.
Where do you get those fibreglass highway markers, can u buy them online?
recurve bows have more spring to them because of the curves in them, still being lighter than longbows with the same power
This channel shows up when i am searching for myself XD
show not teach... unless of course you have a certificate for teaching?
REFLEX/DEFLEX = MORE WHIP MORE POWER yeah you need to research...

That's pretty damn cool
How to maken andere arrow
Pretty certain the recurve tips snap back at a faster rate giving you more momentum hence why over distance recurve bows are more point and shoot and long bows are more of a lob shot.
Bruv the arrow flex too much wit the heavy one that y it don go in
What is that yellow thing called
Use the writing on the pvc to perfectly align your notches
The question is:     is it hard to draw that bow for ordinary person ? And is the fiberclass core better than this used in BACKYARD BOWYER video? Please answer thanks !
Can I ask? Can you tell me what are those materials, cause i cannot clearly understand it....
Does anyone know what the rods are called in the UK and where I can get some?
Erm this is considered powerful? What if I want serious power than can penetrate skulls?
No power tools except a drill, a ban saw, a sander, a nuclear reactor, hurricane Harvey, and a potato to wrap it
This may be an old vid but how do you "weight" your bows?
I'm late to the game, but I think there are two things giving the recurve the same velocity as the high powered longbow.  1.  Because the recurve has a lower draw weight, you are able to pull it back farther.  So upon release, the string applies force to the arrow for a greater distance, thus accelerating the arrow for longer than the longbow does.  2.  The shape of the recurve means that when loaded, more of the tension on the string is directed along the flight of the arrow.  This results in the recurve having a larger percentage of the total draw weight being applied in the direction of the arrows flight, as compared to the longbow.
Boring
The 75 lb bow might be causing the arrow to bend more drastically, making it harder for the arrow to penetrate the target. Try from farther back to give the arrow time to straighten out more?
That's a sad PVC :(
I've been waiting for this video
Hybrid bows are my favourite. [Something right in between a regular long bow and a recurve.]  It's got everything you want in a hunting bow and 45 lbs is more than enough to take down a deer. That's just my preference though.
Have you made arrows for your bow?
Native Americans hunted full sized bison with hand made bows. Anything a machine can do, hands can do. It's harder and time consuming and not quite as pretty, but it CAN be done.
The recurve bow just follows the laws of physic ! the recurve highers the draw power that works on the arrow dramatic without even need more power on exactly higher the input draw power cause of the corved edges !
How did you do the draw weight math
Guys, any tips on what I can use instead of driveway markers, since we don't have anything like that here :D
How long is the bow?
Archery 100
He would be a good older brother
can you send the measures??
Fletching 99
i want you to teach us how to make a recurved bow.
This bow is deadly good (: I mean that in the most peaceful way
Sort of ironic how the video you've posted showing how to make a cheap bow has attracted bow-retailers asking for hundreds
I need to buy that fiber glass stuff. What do you call the fiber glass rods??
Are those cardboard boxes?
1:21 is Florida
Dreadful technique
ok nobody mess with this guy he is badass
Could u show us how to make a quiver?
you funkin rock buddy greetigns from tdot bro
Don't be upsetti have some spaghetti
It gives you more speed and power with a lower draw weight.
can u show how to make arrow?
I have two questions: 1.  how do you make the arrow itself, does it require a certain type of wood? what is the diameter of the arrow? 2. how about inserting 3/4 inch pvc pipe inside a 1 inch pipe? is it a good idea? it is because I can't find those fiberglass sticks in here
What keeps the rods from falling out?
Baby powder to prevent fiberglass splinters from irritating your skin.
Where do u get the rod from?? I live in uk
Recurves bows attenuates vibrations when you release and the arrow "leave" the rope. So arrow ends on target with less "shaking" path, more precisely and penetrating. You should observe this with target on different distances. In near distance a a long bow could be less penetrating when in long distance you should not observe significant differences... English uses long bows for hunting but in war long bows was only used by long distances. Most bows in the ancient era were recurves. Think about mounting archers (turkish, mongols). Even Romans infantry have recurves bows. Maybe japanese have long bows (even mounting an horse) but samurai use them with some extraordinary long arrows I think.
You make me want to binge watch the series Banshee.
can i use any fiberglass rod?
I liked this video because of you had a science moment. I love your passion on the subject.
You would survive the zombie apocalypse. I want one.
Yes a recurve Limb increases the kinetic energy that's why recurve have been use more then long bow becuz they are to long where a recurve is more compact and easyer to handle after the crusades it would be use more offten and make the English long bow obsolete.
Your form in the vid screen shot is bad u need have more relax bow arm not only that u increase your chances of hitting your arm with your lead arm so strate.
What diameter do the rods have to be?
The reason that recurve Chuck's arrows faster is because it is far lighter and seems slightly more tillered. So the work is spread more evenly over the limbs and less of the energy is wasted accelerating heavy limbs. With all of the dead weight in that 8 rod fiberglass/pvc bow, That really low brace, and the stiffer limb tips, it is wasting a lot of energy.
So, is there a way of improving the bow to be more accurate? Or better question: How accurate is such homemade bow?  (Could I still use it as a "normal one" for improving myself?)
please help. I have created the bow up to the stringing, what is that knot called? He doesn't say and I am finding it hard to string the bow accurately. I apparently need to file a bit more too, because my one knot did not hold but I dont want to file too much and cut into the pvc??? edit: it took me a couple hours with my file to get both sides done, he makes it seem so easy. I guess thats what happens when you have muscles still
A limiting factor on power could be the arrow itself? I know weight of bullet affects ballistic in firearms I would think the same forces would apply.
How do you hold the markers in place inside the pvc?
You look  'H A N D S O M E'  bro!!
Use the muscles on your back It helps you draw easier
Can someone make a material list? I'm having a hard time finding the materials :( Please help!
more energy/longer launching time <less energy/much shorter launch time It just about acceleration time I guess
I love your video, I especially love the little bit of constructive criticism you used for the recurve bow. Honest yet trying to be polite... Your video seems fairly easy to follow and actually kept my interest all the way to the end thank you
It's pulling nearly the same as the 60lb bow from how hard you pull topping off.
Superb idea gotta try this when I get the chance
I should be worried about Hurricane Harvey instead of trying to make a bow like i should youtube how to survive this shit but you know hunting season is important too
perfect bow
If u haven't then it be cool if u put together a whole survival kit built and put together with homemade items
Hey, fellow bowyer here, though I work with wood. I thought I would give you an answer to your question about what the purpose is for the recurve; it's kind of two fold. First off, it shortens the bow. This means that it can store more energy per pound/per inch. Second, having those ears (the top quarter or so of the bow limb) bent away from you and towards the target makes the bow want to launch its energy much more forcefully. This, in effect, "flattens" out the cast so that there is less arching in the arrow's flight.   The reason your penetration test had some skewed results, in my opinion, is the result of you using the same arrow for several bows all of differing draw weight. An arrow spined for a 35 lb bow is going to behave much differently than a bow of 75 lbs. A better test would be to test arrows spined to the bow you are using but each weighing the same amount. If you buy your arrows, their weight is measured in "grains". There are ways to measure the weight of homemade arrows though.   Great video, I didn't know you could make bows out of PVC, very interesting!
The invention of recurved bow is a revolutionary event in human military history.
how to make the arrows
I did not see this in the other comments unless I missed it... Another advantage of recurve bows is that a lot of the bow arm mass is moving more up and down and so it cancels out.  You always have the reciprocal momentum of launching the arrow but with a longbow you also have the momentum of the bow arms being accelerated forward and then stopping which does not cancel out.  Of course, the recurve bow arms do have some forward momentum too but not as much.
how did u lose so many subscribersss!!!
You are so handsome. You're not boring at all with the recurve bow issue vs the one that draws more. Someone tell me this man has an ig 😂😂😂
Absolutely, recurves are more efficient.
Recurve bows r more powerful its there dynamics
Long recurve bow?
How thick are the markers?
Just a question: What if you make a pvc bow filled with water and the pvc is capped at both ends. Water can not be compressed, so would that add power to the bow? Thanks for the videos btw.
Three what?
This guy has to also know martial arts. No way he doesn't.
I like to make a bow cause i want to kill people
Can u tell me the material u use coz i dont know very good english mate j am from greece j have passion with bows and i want t know the exact material plz
what about them arrows...
Do you have a video on the 75 lbs draw bow?
Recurves, horn and Mongolian bows are able to seriously stack power at lighter weights and extreme draw lengths. Jim Hamm and several articles in the Traditional Bowyers Bibles series do the math and its unbelievable the lost secrets of 5000 years of the bent stick. Medieval yew war bows pulling 100-130lbs @28" were mass produced and so were their heavy grain arrows. They along with crossbow bolts were heavily grained for armour (yeah I know it sounds British but that's how I spell it) piercing. Regardless, Turkish bows still carry all world distance records. My fathers friends brought Laotian, Vietnamese and Cambodian crossbows back from the war from 1950-'75 and these had longer bamboo arrows. My recently passed Friend, fellow Eagle Scout, Scoutmaster and mentor, Don Abrams, was a member of SEAL Team 1 and had a few stories of arrows stuck in his UH1 on insertions among other "stuff".... you can't make this up... God I miss him.
Yes,
i think unrecurved bow is more powerful than recurved ones.
how to make the arrow
*i have to walk on stage in my college to represent my zodiac sign that is why i m watching the technique. even i don't have to shoot but just to walk with bow and arrow... hah guess my star*
i am here because of far cry 3 and 4
he looks sounds and acts like tiger shroff the famous young indian actor
does it matter if the pvc is furniture grade or not?
Wats kind of rope is that.....?
Wats that yellow thing can anyone help me out here....
Do we need to talk about Kevin?
To draw the heaviest Bow back slap water with a flat palm      😂😂 Who gets the reference
What the hell happened at the end
Recurve appears to allow you to draw farther back and when you let go it pulls a better draw.
May I know the length and diameter of the fiber glasses, please?
GREAT  JOB,  A HERO  BUT DID YOU  HUNT  A GAZALLE   ??
Thank you very much for the informative video. Please, could you show the applications of the highway markers (rods) bit more clearly?   You had one rod with full length, another one cut in half to form two identical bits and the length of the final one looked like it is in between.    Just a  health  & safety tip: when cutting fibre glass, it is best to wear a face protection to prevent fine fibre glass dust particles entering your lungs. Once particles are inhaled they stay there permanently.  Take great care Best of luck
This is a fantastic video.
Recurve bows simply make the BOW SMALLER BUT ALLOW IT TO KEEP HIGHER POUNDAGE. AHHH!!!!!!!! FUck....
you should NEVER use this. Holy Hell. This WILL seriously hurt someone. Also, a compound release? on what, a 35lb bow? and HOW THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW WHAT NATIVE AMERICANS USED THEY DIDNT HAVE NEWTON SCALES OR PULLEY SCALES. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. AHHHH!!!!!!!
maybe the draw length was a bit short. for distance to accelerate.
Try laminating the bows with hemp or snakeskin or pork leather. it should provide more punch
That is the whole point of a recurve bow
Whats the diameter of the fiberglass sticks? I only have acess to 4 mm ones, wondering if it will be enough.
Yep spot on, the point of the recurves on a bow is to allow smaller bows to generate the same power as their larger, straight limbed counterparts. More energy in the tips.
I got a 3/4 inch pvc pipe but the highway markers won't fit into it
Can You Do The Project Without FiberGlass Rods Please Reply
the reason the bow shoots deeper or deep as the larger bow is ........ the shape of the bow sent to you has a thrusting and hard pop release of the arrow just like when you punch just right with a snap or pop the energy transfer is more violent like a bone snapping pop not a slower bruizin the bone seems to over travel on the bigger bow.
Who came here after watching ARROW?
You are right about the Recurve bow....you probably already know this by now....if you have not picked up the volumes of the Bowyer's Bible like 4 volumes I think....they go into the historical styles of bows...and recurve's evolved due to the area having less then perfect wood for heavy hitting bows. So somebody figured out that a recurve imparts more into the shot....sort of like a primitive spear thrower on each end of the bow that "snaps" the string ...basically...but can totally understand you "ah-ha" moment there and geeking out over it...lol..highly recommend those books if you have not read them yet...being this is an older video you probably have...and if somebody else mentioned in comments..apologies ...cheers
Can you use bamboo instead of fiberglass rods (sorry if this is a stupid question)?
I think the recurve bow had greater penetration because of higher kinetic energy transferred from the bow. That means that the speed is different because each bow returns to its original shape at different speeds. I think this is due to a difference in the modulus of elasticity do to a difference in materials, dimensions, or both. I'm not sure. Still a very impressive bow! Subscribed!
How long r the high way markers
that is the best selfmade bow i've ever seen! you need not a lot of tools and everything you need is very cheap! and it works! in a Zombie apocalypse i will remind me!!!
vasava jayesh
NICE!
my bow is 80p pull,you would draw yours easier if you didnt lock your inner elbow,and also if you drew the bow coming down instead of going up you would put out more power,just a tip from one archer to another.cool ass bows though bro.
Is this a simple pvc pipe ? Whats the diameter u used? I need to build this
Thanks for the clear instructions. I had been thinking of making one using fiberglass rods just as you have, but you apparently did the homework etc... Thanks for sharing.  The squirrels in the neighborhood need not be nervous.....its for simple target practice, skill development, and it scratches that engineering itch I seem to have all the time.
for a bow to be most efficient you should place the arrow at the center of the rope so all the elastic force gets released perpendicular to the bow  u dunno how to work the monster bow SHAME
Robs a bank with bow and arrow 😂
yes,.. a recurve throws faster than the weight drawn. the string closes A LOT faster than any other type. try a recurve crossbow out,.. they are monsters
my arrows don't fly straight. they start facing downward after about 5 yards lol
How thick is your paracord?
i made it with smaller tube but it bent and whiten
what kind of pvc pipe you use like diameter, thickness etc
how do you make that button
What is the best pull weight for repetition killing of Zombies? I might run into a herd of walkers & need to kick ass. 😂
The reason for the same penetration resoult by those two boes is the velocity of arrow. The air provides resistace for moving arrow and if the mass is low it wont be able to move over certain speed. So the bow you got as a gift probably gives an arrow the highest speet it can get, useing stronger bow means nothing. To test this theory try heavier arrow.
excellent video. what else can we use instead of highway markers? can we use aluminium pipes?
hey dude! one question, last time I went to a store to buy the pvc tube. However, when I saw it, it felt really soft... is that normal?? It feels like it's going to break easily :s
the theory of re-curve as I understand it is that the string attachment point gets effectively shorter as the string wraps around the re-curve portion of the bow limbs during release causing increased arrow speed for the draw weight
Wrap it with paracord
Great
I don't know how to make a bow of any kind but I definitely want to learn how to make this recurve bow.  That looks like a great project.  Please, bring it on!!!!
its summer and i need something to do other than video games. this is gonna be fun
Now try making the double recurve bow
can you make a windlance
i finally finished making one, but my god was it pain in the painus, anyway it is strong and wonderful <3
I have all the components to make three of these bows as shown in you're video. Great video by the way. I'll let you know how they work. If there good I'll try the recurve. I own two recurves for many years a Bear Kodiak Magnum probably 35 year's #60 pounds draw and one more 25 years #50 pull. Both still shoot great shape with these old eye's I lose to many arrows.But these look like fun. I'll work on these next week. And let you know. Thanks for sharing this skill.
I have all the components to make three bows as shown in in the video. If they work out if

crying this is a disgrace for archer FU***** PVC
Looks like good ole Tennessee weather to me.  One second sunny, hot as hell probably like 110 degrees F and the next minute its snowing at like 28 degrees F typical TN weather
great cant wait to try to make one! appreciated
very interesting and dope video!
you look like a lesbian
hey I want help I want to made bow please help me I didn't understand what you put inside the PVC ?
Thanks for the video.
how do you build it
can i use something else insted of paracord
I think the reason why the curved bow works better is because the string/rope is stopped by the curve, wich transfers the cinetic energy to the arrow
what would happen if i put fiberglass markers in pvc bow whitout cuting them
excellent video, I was very interested on the weight and shape of the bows, and yes the shape does have an effect on the power of the shot. The truth is that the heavier bow needs a really strong person to pull the string all the way back to the ear distance if you know what I mean. and also the tension that is applied to the bow, I pulled a really strong one time and I could not bring it all the way to my ear, but to my cheek and the shot was really effective. again good videos keep it up.
Where did the English bowmen get their fiberglass highway markers? Get back on the Grid dude!
can I have one of those
I've only seen a couple of vids so I wanna know where the heck live with weather like that
do any of u look at some one else's comment and say damn i wish i wrote that
Left all your bows strung up, TRIGGERED
hey, your videos are amazing. Well, i wanted to ask, what is the width of the paracord that you used to make this bow? thanks.
I made a modified version of your 5ft longbow. No idea about the pull strength, but I made mine 6ft with 10 driveway markers, and it gets 11" penetration on a hollow wooden door. That being said, I cut 4 of the 48" markers in half and staggered the lengths, so... short/long matches up with long/short inside the PVC shaft in order to stagger the support (hopefully) without creating weak points. I also added a grip using a bandana and some hose clamps. Thank you so much for the video, though; I wouldn't have been inspired to build this thing if not for you!
Bitch this cost me $31 what's this $10 bullshit
what is the name of this stick why was in PVC bow?
I find it pretty funny that this home made bow is much quieter than a lot of manufacturer bows.
where can I buy all these??? Is there a link available for Europe??
How come it doesn't break with first shot ? O.o
He's MLG
Any ideas for adding a shelf onto this?
The target absorbs the energy differently at the top of the target than the bottom. Try holding it solid.
nice
WHAT KIND OF PVC is that? it bends like hell
What material is the arrow made from?
Hi. How did you make your arrows?
dont forget to make a nockig point on your bowstring it increases the consistency
Thanks for the tutorial, demonstration and your opinion... You have sparked my interest... I'm ready to shoot arrows...
That recurve is awesome, I want one of those.
how do you enchant it?
I tried making the bow with out the fiber glass stuff and the bow just looks like a straight stick with some par accord
how many cm u use as pvc pipe
Highway Markers costs a lot of money dude. Would bamboo sticks work in replace???
How thick is The pvc
Recurve bows reduce draw weight, as well as overall length
how to make arrows
If you were to heat the end and then flatten it then you could bend it and flaten it just like the recurve you have now
why he put fiber inside it ? to make it heavy or what ?
Ottoman and Gokturk archers used recurve bow and their bows were even smaller than your because they shoot while riding horse. And Im not sure but those archers were the best ones at that era.
Hi , am from india and  i want a bow and a set arrows for fishing if it possible can you ship me one and i will ready to pay you the amount, i tried to make one my self but i did not succeed. Kindly replay ASAP
i rly hate the bakyardbowyer what i hate about him is how he looks at the camera with short pauses and i hate his voice
annnd subbed
Do you really have to use fiberglass?
you fire faster with the recurve bow because the launching takes longer, meaning the arrow gains more energy. idk if the curved sides effect it tho, but i assume it does concidering it stops the string earlier and makes the shock when the string reaches the end more stable. but it seems to me that it would only be because its easier to pull with the curves because the bow gives more and it prevents the bow from misshaping.

good video but i still hate you
i hate you
What other material can I replace the fibreglass rods/driveway markers because they are hard to come by here in Australia

What a fantastic design for a bow, this is great!! Well done..
what is material of the string?????
where do you buy these materials?
look how the string rests on the bow the arm will stop the string and launch the arrow
Can't forget the drag on the arrow from the target.

Hey, can you tell us more ebout the subscriber's bow? Does it have a highway marker ?
youvare donkey
just a personal question but is there a difference between white pvc and black pvc or are they the same, great video btw i plan on doing the same thing soon and i'm wondering if there's a difference thanks.
Great thx, where i can find a fiberglass highway markers? can u explain more?
guys i made one, since in india fibreglass rods and paracord are not very common i used a canestick and a utility line costed me almost  only 400 rupees, in american thats about 7 dollars
yeah right look for maharana pratap
Is there a guide on how to make those specific arrow types? They seem easy enough to make
Can anyone tell me the measurements and names of the items used? I'd really appreciate it
Wow this was actually pretty useful... Thanks.  (legit not sarcasm)
that's cool man :)  now I have idea how to make a bow like that ..
I chopped some trees and made a bow for free
what size cord did you use?
That's funny, I made a pvc pipe bow about 5 years ago, and we found it to have a 55 lb draw weight. That's using 3/4". Using the 1" PVC yeilded a bow that had an 85 lb draw weight. I could not for the life of me pull that shit back. Even the owner of it could only pull it about a quarter of the way. I don't know what's going on with your bows, but you aren't getting strength anywhere near what you should...

Please, USA, switch to the metric system.
Please tell me about Para cord? And fiber glass rod (specifically) length? Exactly what material you used. Thanks for the video
I love ur projects dude
the arrow hit the wooden bored  behind the box

what kind of string is used in the bow
Great vid! I'd like to make one for myself and my son. He is only 9.... what length pipe do you recommend for a BOW for children? Thanks
I want to know how to make the recurve bo. Thank you for all of your video
Da fuk? This is like $30-$50 if you don't have like half of this.
What are the arrows made out of?
Dag this guy is so my type,  I want him so much lol . Wonderful :)
The recurve bow is more powerful because it has more surface area of the bow pulling back giving it more froward force as the bow "straightens out" again.
I love that recurve bow. It seems more powerful with less draw pull. Very well done, sir.
I would have laughed if he shot the camera
where do i het a paracord?
You probably looked this up even before you posted this video, and I'm just making an idiot of myself, but it's because the heavier bow had less draw distance. It's like a rifle, the longer the barrel is the more time the gases have to accelerate the bullet, the longer the draw distance of the bow the more time the bow has to accelerate the arrow. That's why crossbows need such high draw weights.
Nice bow, but did you make the arrows?
what is the name of all staffs?
Привет
now cosplay hanzo
Do you "homemake" your arrows or buy professional ones
I used this for a project at school great vid. can you just make a vid on how to make the arrows
really neat stuff. good video
would the driveway markers make good crossbow bolts or REGULAR BOW ARROWS ?
Can you please list the items
What i wanted to ask was where did you get the fiberglass rods .
Hey! love your videos and had fun making this bow but I'm curious as to where the handle should be located to optimize the bow?
so im pretty sure that the reason your viewer bow is so hardcore is because the string is being stressed from three separate curves. you can probably figure out which pill provide more kinetic energy by adjusting the curve/length behind the two recurves.
Where do you live
The Mongolian bow was better the the European long bow especially for horse warfare which is why or getting those results
Can you list us the materials? And the measures
Where the threat From? And What The Threat Name? Because So Many Treats And I Just 11 Years Old >"<
Which one of ur subs made it. Because I really want one
recurves have more power with less draw weight.
Hey, could you please tell us the measures of the fiber glass rods? Also, i find all your videos incredibly cool, interesting and fascinating! Thanks for sharing your passion and knowledge with us. ; )
What a shame I'm 17 I can drive back 100 pound bow with ease
The subscriber made it the right way..
When is his next Alfa mail opening??
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
Not boring at all man !! Really enjoyed your video - THANKS !!, Could you show us how to make ARROWS?
Hi, great video.  so... i am not able to find those driveway markers, can you suggest some other things please
Those muscles tho. Guess I should start doing some push ups...
Nice piece of bullshit
The subscriber to views ratio on this video tho!
you seem cool, not arrogant, many well travels ahead for you yes
Recurve bows of hunnic turkic types were 2-3 times more powerful Than longbows
"in the art box.".. *grabs the lighter on his way out?... You smoking some buds boi
thumbnail looks photoshopped
Plz suggest a substitute for Driveway Markers
3/4 inch is that inside or outside diameter?
Good nice
Where do you get the fiberglass rods?
also ive been shooting for 15 years, I can handle about 150-200 rounds of 6 arrows at 65 lbs of draw weight. takes practice.
make the recurve with the same pvc, just use a pvc heat blanket, makes that pipe limp and pliable as a wet noodle.
plz tell me the PVC wall's width
yep recurves store more energy in the curves
Eli! Bro! Those drive way markers...are they fiberglass rods?  I'm in the UK and the only driveway markers I can find are lights or reflecty floor panels.
If you made one of these, and left it strung for a few months or a year, would the pvc deform and decrease performance? I know that's the point of the rods on the inside but I'm wondering if I made one if you should unstring it after use to maximize performance.
Good teaching clip.  Going to give her a try!
what r that yellow rods
cool video. would have never guessed it could be this easy!
Can you send me a a bow i really want a bow im a subscriber
Is there an alternative to the fibreglass rods?
I have a question I'm french, and I can't find anything close to a fiberglass rod or driveway marker in the tool shops or anywhere Could anyone help me ? If you know where to find them and how they are actually called in french
I try to make this what kind of paracord you using or mine is just that old cause it's nowhere close to the clearance he has in the video cord keeps popping my hand!
hey,can you tell me what's the tools and things needed cause i am not really good in english...thx
Fucking hanzo mains.
if I may ask what are any alternatives for the drive way markers or fiberglass rods? there are none available in my country or city. any suggestions would be appreciated.
The shape of the recurve bow is the power affect.. It also known as a M bow as shape like an M.. Nice video by thee way
what's the song name
How long shold the markers be?
The two points or recurves curve out to give the bow extra power with a easier draw
He needed a nail and a lighter... I know what he was up to.
how much would a decent recurve PVC bow run me? I need a maker 😹 I got the cash 😸
Ohhhhhh please don't put an arrow through my camera please (says either brave or stupid bowman)
I just got legend 27 ad
This was sick. The bloopers were funny too haha
Yours is my new favorite channel, thanks for info.
Nice vid! But why paracord and not bow string? Do you make you own arrows too to fit the paracord? Thanks man
So, I don't know if someone commented yet, but what you experienced with your recurve is what drew me in to shooting recurve bows. When I was deciding between longbows and recurves, everything I researched said that the strings on recurves stay in contact with the arrow for a longer period of time, resulting in more time for acceleration and more force behind each shot. Compounds stop way short of both long and recurve, and long bows still stop quite a bit shorter than recurves. The shape of the limbs just provide that extra push, and you get quite a bit more power  for less effort. When choosing arrows or arrow materials, you kinda have to take the extra force in to consideration as well. Er, that's if you shoot wooden or fiberglass. Wonderful world of bows.
Do you use feather fletchings? Or plastic?
damnnnnnn that's pimp!!
that is really interesting
what you have actually found is the spring limit of pvc + (internal fibreglass rod), ie although it takes 70 lb to curve the bow, the spring speed which pvc will return to natural shape has a limit. this means that your 35 and 45 lb bows are at peak spring rate for the material. return speed + weight = arrow speed.  to increase arrow speed you must increase bow return speed and apparently pvc speed is at maximum at approx 45lb. increasing the internal fibreglass rod weight may help, BUT, the natural speed of pvc will expenetially keep the speed to a lower limit.  look at it like this...... a car can do a top speed eg 100......and  a sports car will do eg 150. if the sport car were to tow the slower car, neither car will reach 150 even if both cars are at full throttle.  the slow car is only making power to 100 and after that speed it is dead weight to the sports car between 100 and 150. the top speed during towing will be eg 125. if you increase the top speed of the sport car on its own by 20, when towing the slower car it wont tow at the full 20 faster, maybe 10 mph increase. the pvc is the slow car and the fibreglass rods are the sport car.   hope this analogy helps.
Your Head Is Bigger Than......
You will deform the bow if you keep it strung up the string will slowly take the shape of where is is strung from and the bow will be less powerful
you don't fire a bow, you shoot a bow, and you loose arrows (at least I think it is, not sure)
Could you make a fiberglass and PVC pair of scissors to cut that terrible haircut ?
Any alternatives to fibre glass driveway markers
Or maybe you aren't pulling the 70 pound bow back so your getting a short power stroke and no where near 70 pounds of weight lol.
9 degrees hurting?!!! LOL .... I'm freezing here in Brazil with 9 dregrees hahahaha....Good work on the bow man!
Well, I have everything I need, but now I'm looking and I think my markers are thicker than other ones because I can barely get three in there. Edit: well, it looks like I bought fiberglass electric fence posts instead. I guess I'll have a bit of a lower draw weight, which actually will work better for my purposes.
well the bows are self made because I have a wooden (American) longbow and the guy who made it is really good and he talked to me a lot and there are several ways to make the bows way faster.
The recurve bow worked better because recurves store more energy and deliver more energy than the same draw weight straight bow. So even though you had a 70 pound draw weight long bow and a 45 pound recurve bow the recurve bow still got more penetration because of its energy efficiency
what material is bow string made of..???
the energy of a bow is the powerstroke multiplied by the draw weight. The bigger longbow has more force behind it, but the recurve looks to have a longer powerstroke.
the your super 8 bow have so much pressure that may generate to much air atrict in the arrow.
it looks like its about the shape, the fan made bow as a more curvy shape so it its like a more efficient "spring"
can you give me a link to all off the materials you used??
Neat

Could someone tell what he is using? I mean the PVC Pipe.. I live in the EU and we don't have Inches and Feet so its a bit hard to understand
at 7:10 did I just witness a drug deal?
how much for the pulley bow?
you have a nice triger
@ZNA Productions the recurve of the recurve bow helps launch the arrow faster by adding extra forward motion when released while decreasing the strength required for drawing
Something about the 1" (and larger) pvc (or wood... metal... chocolate cake... whatever) is less efficient on the snap? More material to move and eat up energy or something like that... then there is less "left over" for the arrow.
I did an archery class (I'm 13 and I was 11 than) and we got some pvc recurve bows a lot like that one and they are pretty nice
Bro use a vice
Yes, recurve bows have less range, but have the same power for a lower draw weight(it's for if your not strong enough to draw a full longbow)
omg this thing can kill ... interesting haha joke
you could be an olympic archer your really good
The reason why the recurve bow goes deeper is because its shorter thus the energy of the 45 Pounds of Draw weights actually gets put in to work and if you draw it closer to the maximum draw there is more "draw time" for the continuous energy to be jammed in to the arrow.The 70 Pound bow is a long bow meaning you need longer arms to get closer to the Maximum draw weight. Think of the scale as the first half of the standard distribution curve from statistics. (Give a shoutout or a gift if you like my explanation) xD
do the three markers have to be five feet as well?
Can I buy one from you @ZNA Productions?
I should be asleep it's four am
Struggling a bit to find these materials in England. Anyone got any tips? xD

i made it , he missed a step
can u show us how to make really easy slingshot bands?
where can iget some PVC?
Those bloopers 😂😂
What arrows should I use
When u close ur eyes and listen to this guys voice he sounds like vanoss
How thick is the para cord?
A recurve bow is designed to shoot an arrow faster with less draw weight. Only problem is that it can't go that far.
dude ur not drawing them from right spot ur not even anywhere near the center of string most of the power isn't getting directed at correct angle esp for ur 1inch bow it's draw looked so bad, surprised you even hit target with it
what can we replace the fiber rods with???
what name 1st items 0:25
i do archery and this is so cheap and so good. my conpliments wow
Thank you very much that was very helpful. I made a pvc bow with 2 tubes(one inside the other) and it's very good for me(1st time making a bow).
can u try to list the price and matierals
Cant find these fiber glass rod anywhere in australia, what are they usually used for?
could you please have a list of everything I would need
how to make arrow
the reason it works better (the recurve bow) is because the curves actually work as like smaller pieces to help sling it foward. thats my guess.
When I was younger I used to cut down trees and harvest the wood. I got so good at building my own bows that I just stopped because the arrows that I would shoot over to expensive when I lose them
I've made a hedge long bow and the problem i keep coming across is that i can't find string for it
next stop:How to find a dear.
I'm pretty sure no one coped what he did
Another thing that will help increase draw weight is the cord length. The shorter the length, the more tension on the bow and therefore, a heavier draw weight
there's a book out there called the bowyers bible. one of the things it talks about is the relationship between string angle and draw weight. lowering the string angle (usually by reflexing the tips) lowers the draw weight while still delivering the same amount of energy to the arrow. another way of looking at that is that a higher draw weight doesn't necessarily mean a more powerful bow. what determines a bows power is how fast it shoots an arrow of a given weight. I bet if you chronographed all those bows you would find out that the reflexed bow was shooting faster. I believe you can still legally download the bowyers bible volume one online for free
The recurve is naturally more powerful than the long if both are made with the same material. It's going to shoot more springy. I've always been curious as to how a low-elastic rubber would do as a back on a PVC bow...
How do you make the arrows
cool
what is that u insted in pvc
nice bow
0:22
They shot the same because for some reason that curve makes it so u don't have to pull as hard and it will shot just as hard as tht one
No idea what's going on? That's just rain. Happens occasionally.
what is draw length on the bow?
i cant find the suplis i need
just looking at the comparison: the monster bow, when you draw it back, looks to be about 22" from hand to hand. the recurve bow 'pushes' your holding-hand farther forward and at the same time curls back on the ends, giving you about 28-30" from hand to hand. the 'recurve' seems to 'spring forward' upon release. this may explain why the monster bow and recurve shoot about the same speed....just the way it looked to me when i viewed it.
I hate fiber glass too ZNA
Probably someone below mentioned... Higher draw weight is doesn't mean faster or powerful shot and more penetration. Also you lesser draw weight bows needs softer spine arrows, higher draw weight bows needs stiffer spine arrows. If you shot 1000 spine arrow with 40# bow, your arrow flex too much, fly bad, hit the target sideways not straight. Also straight bows susch as you made here and recuve bows like your subscribers bow, has very different dynamics. So what I mean is draw weight doesn't describe arrow speed. an arrow shot from a 28# high end Olympic recurve bow with proper setup, probably will penetrate more than 40# pvc bow.
Where do i get fiberglass rods???
You have FAILED this CITYYY!!!
which type of rope did you use to make this bow
may someone know ebout  a rplacement for the fiberglass sticks becuse I cant find them in my cantry
Made my own today, it's amazing. Thanks sooo much!
In the next episode of the walking dead...

hey! awesome video. can you please tell me more about the arrow?  pls make a diy video. thanks!
Can someone list the parts I can't understand what he's saying
I feel like his arms aren't long enough to draw much further on the large bow. I could be wrong, and it's just technique from practice. though it seems he has the same success with the recurve because he can max its potential
or buy one from Menards for $30 mine is a 15lb draw weight and it was cheap
whats the yellow thing
what the yellow is that
Bruv...that's some crazy fucking shit!!!! Great video fella! Peace from the UK!
The recurve bow already naturally has tension on the ends and you add more when you pull it back
Hello, what did you use to close the open ports on the 3/4 PVC? Thank You in advance
what do we need??
i made a pair of these with my son. it was some quality family time. thank you, liked and subed.
Can this hunt small game?
how many pounds is this bow?
Where would I be able to buy the tools and materials you're using?
Oricomi
maybe the recurved bow has a faster "string recovery time" ( time the string returns back to it's original position after a shot)  than a normal bow, which would give more power to the arrow without adding pull weight...just my ignorant 2 cents.
Just got back from Home Depot, bout to make one
What r u wearing on ur left arm???
Can you spray paint your bow and make it look cool?
Regarding the difference in penetration between the 45lb recurve and the 70lb pvc bows, it would be the efficiency of the spring tension transferred to the arrow. I.e the 45lb is faster at returning to the non drawn position.
Where can I buy fiber glass rod?
i made it and i love it
thank you for this vid! its hot by the way. do you have any video for making the arrows?
what is that yellow colour
Hi an English longbow draw weight is about 110 pounds 400 newtons is it possible to get closer to that draw weight using your methods ?? .
Hey 1st i wanna say great video , it's awesome man , i intended to build this, problem is i can't find fiberglass highway marker , can you suggest a substitute for it ?
tnx for the video...now i can be someone else...i can be something else....next up in green arrow...wait what?
Q&A Has anybody tested this for speed? FPS? How/would you adjust the bow for a taller person w/ longer draw length?
i love you man
where do you rest the arrow

its not the power of th bow its the target....   thats why you can only hit so far... armor factor...
you don't know what is goin on here? I believe it's called rain, pretty common.
Could my piping be 4cm or would that be to thick
can i tell you the pully bow as you call it is called a compound bow
WTF u look like Matt Ogus
how powerful is it?
how far would the arrow go?
do you think you make a really good bow made out of wood
Recurve bows add resistance to the draw weight. You might notice it straightens out at the draw, which is the added resistance.
recurve bow is a bow for moving more faster and if you are on a horse
Did you even look at yourself drawing the last bow? You have the arrow 60% of the way up the shaft...  Plus, recurve adds power with less draw, look at the flexibility and spring in it, you can see the physics!
Mine cost 13 dollars and I didn't use a the things in the middle
question can you tell me the name of the thing you used to string the bow please because its not clear what you said in the video
what kind of knot did you tie I'm almost done with mine right now as I type
YOU have FAILED this CITY
Not sure if this is the right word for this but what is the draw back length I want to find out what arrows I can use.
Why are you shooting arrows in your in unfenced residential backyard?
where can you get those specific rods and what are the proper dimensions for the fiber glass rods
Awesome, and now I can kill some annoying people's on my sight.
How did I get here?
6.09 I think that your bow is transferring some of the elastic energy into kinetic energy  (to your body) , While the curved bow is acting as a good balance to transform more elastic energy into kinetic (to the arrow)
subscribe s bow is traditionally Mongolian style bow and this is how we counquer the world with :)
What you used inside that PVC bow I am making this but I don't know what is that plz help me..
anyone know how he tied the knot?
can you suggest an alternative to the driveway markers? they are pretty expensive in my country.
title said cheap and in the first minute the said about 10$
Any way to make cheap arrows?
is it true that pvc bows have a short life like a year
in thumbnail 15$  but in video 10$ clickbait bitch
I cant trust myself with this , I am also scared of while I am holding the bow , the paracorde un ties and the pvc just hits me in the face along with drive way markers
great job :)
I bought a brand new 60lbs recurve bow that can be broken down to be carried.  Seriously, just pay the extra $40 and have a bow that you can pass down to your kids.  That said this was a great idea and tutorial.
This is a great video!  Thanks!
Can you leave a bow like this strung for storage or should you take the string off every time your done using it?
freaking sick brah I'm jelly
Could I put less fiberglass rods inside to make there be less draw weight?
the curves make it stronger, plus because of the lightweighr of the arrows you hit the max penetration-weight ratio
it's turkish bow. curvy because stretched to the opposite side.
I guess it might have something to do with the fact that the recurve bow basically has three curves that get bent  and "jump" back into their original form. Pardon my english, but I hope you get my point.
how much lbs ?
so the subscriber bow better than ur "monster bow"... ok
Can it shoot wood arrows?
is this normal pvc or any special
Recurve does indeed offer a mechanical advantage, which could explain the video. The reason they weren't used more widely in the past is because they were more difficult to make and more susceptible to the bad weather that was common Northern Europe.
It's $15 bucks if you have a garage full of tools. Will actually cost you about $50 to get the equipment and tools.   I just made my bow from this tutorial, so awesome!
favorite video
recurve bow is the strongest bow among the militaries before gunpowder. This is what ottoman units used
you look like a young triple g  gennady golovkin!!
ill just keep it by twigs and sticks
Very good thanks
the tip on a recurve bow should be lighter than the rest of bow but just as thick.  This increases the speed of the arrow. Check out Primitive Pathways  he has some knowledge on bows that is valuable. His making a primitive bow is good other than there is not much primitive in his methods his reasoning and understanding of bows is great.  Just saying.
I also made the 35 pound PVC bow after seeing the video on Backyard Bowyer channel and it is a blast to make and shoot.  Thanks for showing us how you made it 😀. I think his channel is how I found yours for the first time in the recommended vids, and I'm glad I did!
where do u get those drive way marker
chichico! come back to enchufetv
with that weather, you must be living in south florida lmfao.
Any recommended arrow? Also what about the notch for the arrow?
what type of arrows are you using
very clever well done
why do you think the Mongols used them.
obviously, arrow speed doesn't depend only on draw weight. You need to consider the weight of the bow limbs, especially towards the tips. Also, the shorter the bow for the same draw weight, the faster the tips will travel.
I'm 55 years old I've been outside my whole life and I did not know you could make a fucking bow out of PVC pipe and fiberglass rods that is so cool the damage I could have done bomber
what's the draw weight of this thing?500 gram
hello i'm french and i don't understand what it's need to build it, anyone could write here the things needs for to build it pls ?
What a pest that intruder guy
Nice video. The recurve on a bow does assist a lot with kicking more power for sure. Which is why you get about the same penetration with the lower poundage recurve in relation to the higher poundage traditional style. The recurve bow is able to store more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than an equivalent straight-limbed bow. Which in turn gives a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow. However personally I do prefer compound bows over recurves for the simple fact they have the let-off when at full draw. Which makes the bow easier to fire as you're usually only holding around 30% of the draw weight with a compound when at full draw.
All I could think about was Zelda hype and how I can be Link
That's awesome! I'd love to see you make a crossbow like that
Sorry but the advert was about shaving and trimming beards, i saw nothing but 2-3 week long beards if you can call it a beard. Let it grow for 6+ months
Fantastic, you know your stuff!
wow I almost can't believe it. a pvc bow that works. I do know that a recurve bow is longer in length,  increases the draw length and power stroke from the string to the riser. 15 to 20 percent typically. It reduces torque, which is more forgiving to a shooters form. There is also more mass forward rotation of the limbs, rather than outward, so more energy is transferred forward to the arrow instead of outward from the string. Therefore your lighter recurve is as powerful as your longbow because it is more efficient.  Your longbows major flaw is that it uses more material rather than stiffer material of equal mass. more mass means more energy absorption into itself, and friction as the glass rods rub against each other. I wonder if you could use solid graphite from old fishing poles as your force multiplier or something similar.  Either way,  nice work
who agrees that zna productions looks like leafyishere??
Would using 1 inch PVC change the result of the bow, rather than using 3/4 inch?
Check for Hungarian and Turkish Bows why Recurve bow is much effective...
send to me
nice video but can u writte what are the materials i dont understand english very well.. ty!
Assuming you were pulling the 75 pound bow back all the way, most likely the reason the penetration was so bad was because of the mass of the limbs. Outer limbs on bows are narrowed so that the extra mass does not take away from the recoil speed of the limbs. Essentially you had the functional equivalent of a low rpm/high torque motor. You had more energy but you needed a much heavier arrow to take advantage of it. If you were to retest using a heavier arrow, assuming the bow is decent, it will penetrate considerably deeper than the lighter arrow.
Recurves apparently came from a place where trees suitable for long bows didn't grow. Being shorter, they were more able to be shot in any direction from horseback.Saw it on the history channel
what knot did you use for the string on the main long bow in this video
The curve bow looks like Mongolian bow
cool video, great lighting!
can I have the recurve bow
Would that be string enough to kill a bunny?
Pretty cool ay I'm gonna try n make one n see how I go, thanks for the vids brother ✌🏼️
Yeah man recurve shoots like 1.5 times better than a long or short straight bow if in correct, I like the pvc idea that's so easy and effective.
ten dalas
it launches the arrow faster giving it more power with less weight
I hope you read this. i need to know the radius of the glass fiber marker... 6mm? 8mm?
Wtf hapend with your arm? look at 6:08
Thanks. This is very use full video. But now the problem is I have bow not arrows. Kindly let us know about your arrows in brief. Thank you.
What material you have used to make arrow?
whoever says they watch this for the plot is lying
5:54 that's a turkish bow (asian bow) :D its hard to make it i think
I just made this bow.  Very nice and super easy.
omg when he pulls the bows back 😍😍😍😂
he learned his bow skills from movies not books
ZNAProductions. I'm no scientific expert but originally, recurve bows are supposed to shoot a large weight but with a low pull, this is caused from the backward bending limbs on the ends, the bends add the extra weight when fired but add no visible extra weight when pulled
can you start putting in a material list in the description please.
it worked I was able to kill a bird
Hi, I can't find driveways markers in Brazil, Do you know how thick are they?  I could only find 4,2mm fiberglas around here.
how to make the loop.?
how long are the road markers
My string keeps coming out of the notch after about three shots.
Those are some nice arms
Looks great on killing pests, I really need to hunt some vermins.
yes, the recurve bow springs the arrow better. thats the whole point,lol.
can you tell me the materials
15$ my a$$ I SPENT 85$
How tick the driveway markers are??
Please Share: https://www.gofundme.com/battle-against-als
fuck fiberglass
Hi please tell the..  Name of parts.. I have understood pvc pipe..  Fiberglass rod and what is the name of string cord u used? Plz
Love your videos. I did notice that when you draw your bow, you keep your left arm straight and pull with your right arm. I've hunted with archery for years, so some advice just to try. When you draw, keep your left arm bent, pull the string with your right arm and push the bow away from you with your left. You'll be able to draw heavier weight and it reduces the fatigue from shooting a lot.... Just something for you to try.
Just got done making mine it's just mine I had to make it 4 feet and 2 inches with 4 feet markers honestly I don't think it pulls 35 pounds anymore cause I've pulled 30/35 pound bows no problem but this one god it's hard at least for me since I just started shooting bows
I like to
Wish you taught us how to make the knot
Nice video! I appreciate you taking the time to put up these resources.
I just made it and it works really well
it worked i did it
How do u figure out how long the pvc pipe needs to be to fit you
Different bow's are used for different draw weights and distance. The recurve is decent at 100m - 150m but after that, the arrows starts dropping and so does the force.
It's the extra "pop" the recurve bow produces, something about the string snapping against the ears a certain way because of the recurve or something like that, give an extra "umph" at the end
Hi, what's the name of that yellow pipe and it is a aluminum or plastic pipe?
i'm making one! i'm a procrastinator, but it will get done!  showing my sis and our friend
War-bows had pull weights of 100-130 lbs I heard.
You could make your own arrows out of those fibreglass rods too right?
how did you make the pulley/compound bow?
snap push more.
Make another bow for 5$
omg that's so accurate~!
Is there any substitute for the driveway markers?
Hey asks before he came in tho lmao
Can you find these materials at home depot
how and why did u put the fiberglass in the pipe???
How long is the pvc
tooooooop
a crossbow next?
The recurve is exactly how you said it. Higher power for a lower draw weight.
do you have the two fingered gesture in USA ? it's similar to the flip but two fingers. it possibly originated from the English archers gesticulating to the French that they still had there pulling fingers. the French would cut them off if the caught them
I am watching this video in 2017
I am so glad I was watching this at home.  I laughed *so* hard on that phone call out-take :)
thats the added advantage of the recurve , you get more torque with less draw weight and with a shorter length .
I suggest a heavier arrow. The arrow you use may be flexing.
Damn! Excellent Fallout skills man.
look up the mongol bow it was a recurve that had a close power to if not more then an English long. bow
good videos man
whats that thing on your hand that you use to launch the arrows?
Lets just face it... no one came here for the bow, we all came here for those sexy traps and lats. :D
Cross bow is better.
the point of the recurve bow is to be able to shoot faster farther and to pack a really big punch
dude i love this vid. thank you. i been wanting a new bow but unfortunatly dont have the money.
You're pulling up to high, try putting your hands together at the hip and drawing from your core. I'm sure by now you've figured this out but your form is great in this video, you're just using the wrong muscles to pull.
thank's the idea
how do you keep the fiber glass in the middle from sliding out when you bend the bow to tie the string????
Brothers!
The recurve really does launch the arrow faster. The curves act as leverage.
Do you watch the show the arrow? That's what got me into it

Bow works great! Just made my first one today after watching this video. Took me less than 30 minutes to finish it. Everything I needed was available at Lowes. It all came in at under $15 dollars with tax included. The fiberglass rods are in the section with the mailboxes. I bought 31 inch length arrows at Academy Sports for $4 dollars each. Now I need an arm guard! That string hurts! Lol! Keep up the great work dude! Subscribed!
yes is nesaseri cuz I go hunting almost every week
just a suggestion, try pulling the string with your left hand.. if you cant try curling 45 to 60 to 95 pounds, 50 times a day 25 times in morning and night over one month, then you'll see and feel a difference. p.s. The second day will hurt if you dont work out... i'm curling 115 pounds now with no problem at all.
I'm going to make so many of the things on this channel
how much for one
So I made the bow and got arrows, but the arrows don't fit the paracord and I don't want to make my own. Does anyone have a suggestions?
Any alternative to the fibreglass rods? Cant find any in my local stores
I'm drafting you & Primitive Tech to my zombie apocalypse team.
no homo, but nice triceps bro
I'm glad to see u use the bow in most of ur videos u jus make the item but never really show u using it
What kind of arrows do you use with the para-cord? I'm going to try your design tomorrow!
live in texas cause that happens
Are you a hunter?
The reason the arrow did not perform better on the monster bow is because the arrow did not have a stiff enough spine. It was flexing in flight when hitting the target reducing penetration.
What cord was it
What is the diameter of the highway markers you're using? We don't really have standard highway markers here, however there's plenty staves of fiberglass of different diameters.
robin from the hood
I made this bow exactly how you shoes. I love shooting it. Just wanted to say thanks for the tutorial and that I enjoy your videos.
"Now the subscriber recurve bow"
trying my first recurve pvc. is there a preferred string to use or just any b50?
Can someone please tell me what is the diameter of the fiberglass?
How do you tie that knot? Thank you. 2:42
OMG! I've been here since 30k and just came  back after 2 weeks, CHANNEL BLEW UP!!!
The arrow is sort of bottlenecking your performance.   A bow with higher draw weight takes a heavier and stiffer arrow, because otherwise much of the force is lost due to the amount of "flex" in the arrow. I think you'd find if you stuck that same arrow in a 100lb draw weight bow, you wouldn't actually be able to get more penetration. (Even if you could pull it.) You might even break the shaft of the arrow.   You could try the same thing again with a stiffer, heavier arrow, and you should get a more noticeable difference between the two.   The only other possibility I can imagine would be internal friction in the longbow. Perhaps the rods shift against one another during draw and release?   Generally a recurve just allows you a longer draw in a smaller bow. You get those little Mongol archery recurve bows which are quite small, but have quite high draw weight and able to take a full-length draw. You couldn't do that with a short "self" straight bow, or you'd have to make it so whip-tailed that it wouldn't nearly as hard as its draw weight might have you believe, and would be prone to failure.
At the minute 1.30 when you cut the Fiber Glass ...what was the measurement of  each piece of the Fiber Glass ?
u are so beautiful
where do you buy cheap driveway markers
Great video brother
How can I purchase a bow from you?
Is there any way to make a weaker bow (lower draw weight) using the same method? Like using 4 feet of 1/2 pvc piping or something
Could you potentially put an arrow shelf on it?
Recurve bows are training long bows for young adults so they are basically long bows with less draw weight
Awesome video! Love the channel! Some advice though, paracord stretches which is actually bad for bowstrings as it absorbs some of the energy that could be used to cast the arrow. Try either boy strings or very high strength deep sea fishing line may be better as well! Love the simplicity though
Good vid!! Idiot proof! Specialy for me! 😂😂 The ancient design recurve bows were the best around. Specialy in Mongolian times. Conquered much of eastern europe with that bow on horseback!  Roman legionaires had no chance! It also went (depending on range) through their tortoise tactics.  The mobility and power were off the charts(for back then!). Plus, these were warriors from birth! By 7 years old, these Mongolian warriors were quite good horsekids! Potent and absolutely destructive mix.  A warrior culture with high tech weaponry.  That said...war is barbarous and for highly stupid cultures. Fact.  Parallel with USA here. Between the lines...Where a corrupt goverment domesticates little boys and insecure teenagers to be ""warriors"" to go fight the ""good"" fight. Actually, just using domesticated males and females, to protect US corpotocracy and literaly kill the competition!! Plus steal their petrol!!   A True Warrior is first MASTER of himself.   Understanding his or hers Symbiosis with his Biology.   Understanding the need for compassion and humaness.   Understanding how NOT to be a slave for the extremely stupid human beings that are pulling many strings.
please make a 150 pounds pvc longbow sir
so cool we did this all the time when there were no youtube nice ZNA
What knot is that?
just made one lol at work since slow soo instead of the 3fiberglass rods I did two with a center of sch 40 PVC    results strong as hell I work heavy construction all day I'm only getting 35-45% on draw
the recurve bow stores more energy efficiently than a straight bow. the curved limbs aid in the speed as well it has something to do with kinetic energy...i forget exactly all i know is a good placed arrow will do the job at 30# or 70#  anyways good job buddy
I would just like to ask if there are any alternatives for the fiber glass rods/driveway markers? I already went to some main hardware stores in my country like wilcon depot and ace hardware, sad to say they have none.  please have honest suggestions.  been getting back at this tutorial for quite a while now since I don't have power tools at home.
what is the length of the fiber Glass Road Marker, anyone can tell me ??
Ok, but imagine how much better these would be if you painted them *black*. At least 5-10% I'd guess.
could anybody suggest an alternative for the driveway marker.....I couldn't get one
where do you get that type of fibreglass from im interested in making a bow now
I made one with a few fiberglass rods in it and it keeps repulsing I didn't put the split marker in the middle but is that necessary
can you make 70 lb PVC bow
can someone pls tell me how to make the loop at 2:36
driveway marker length?
Part of the reason for low penetration of the more powerful bows is that your target is moving. Anchor it down or make it heavier.
Nice video, by the way, what did you use for arrows?
i built this and I'm twelve  perfect
Recurve bow maybe its because the limbs go slightly back or maybe because of the low draw weight I dont know.
nice
what is that yellow rod? i did not hear clearly...
What are the chances of this breaking/snapping/failing?
How do you call the yellow things...? Sorry I come Form germany and my english is not so good and I cant understand it
tell me a substitute for that driveway marker thing... please..I can't get it...
7:43 das mah jam
is the recurb bow pvc))??
Can you provide me a measurments for pvc pipe and fiberglass rods?
Fucking hell show me how you got those arms.
what kind of nod was there?
angers karin, correct
I'm trying to make a crossbow out of pvc
how thick is the pvc pipe
do yourself a favor and pause at exactly 3:26
the re-curve bow is also known as a Traditional compound bow, the mechanics work hind of similar as a pulley compound bow , accept the pully compound bow can be remodified and has a decreed draw weight when all the way back which gives you better stability when aiming, but when you release the string the power accelerates and fires the arrow pretty fast
what size markers
Would you be able to get me the piep please
Can you get the fiber glass markers at a hardware store?
What arrows are those
что он туда вставил? что за стержни?
To make it you could heat it up lots and bend then cool it when it is still in shape then do the string and all of that the fiber glass can go in the bow before you put the string on
FOR ALL THE BOWS
ILL PAY U
Of you care about this look up Backyard Bowyer
exelent!
How long are the fiberglass driveways?, 48 inchs?
The only thing I had from this was a rat tail file that I found on the street..
whats the name of that material made of fiberglass, i mean how can i buy it or ask for it pls
DUDE! you should make some Cestus gloves
recurve bows keep the tension all the way up to the end while normal bows loss the tension losing power and speed at the end of the shot.
where did you get the other one or did you make it
where did you get the memo
+ZNA Productions Just because a bow has a heavy draw weight does not make the limbs snap forward quicker (and propel the arrows quicker). The shape of the recurve is what makes the arrows quicker off the string - if you follow the path that tip of the limbs take during the draw and release cycle, the path drawn by the tips of the recurve bow is flatter than that of the path drawn by the longbow, resulting in a quicker acceleration of the arrow, and thereby more efficient delivery of the projectile. Also, that last 2 or 3 inches is critical for getting to the total draw weight of the bow. My recurve jumps from 40ish pounds to 55# over the last 3 inches of my draw cycle; this is because draw weight increases exponentially with increased draw length (for the effective useful range of the bow). Basically, the limbs of the longbow squish together more when you pull it back and they don't get the arrow going as fast as quickly as the recurve bow; so when you're going traditional, aim (#puns) for limb quickness as a priority over draw weight.
I made a bow that pulls 'bout 2 pounds...I use it to hunt cockrouches
That sub bow is a horse bow not a recurve
how he do the loop tie
Just made one and it works badass. Thanks for making this video!!!
Superb information. Thank you. Ridzlam, Western Australia.
Cool video .. thanks for your effort.. well done !!!
How do I get fiber glass? Where can I buy it. I'm in Jamaica. However,  when I type in fiber glass in google I see products that were made by it. I don't see the one in which you used in this video. can you help me out with that. I really lie your video.
crazy Russian hacker copied this
The fiberglass highway markers can they be found at the Hoe depot?
I'd love to see you make the recurve. Been wanting to make a recurve for awhile now, but I don't have a shop atm so this kind of make would be great for me.
I think we might need to talk about Kevin...
Very good
that legolas stance
Are the drive way markers necessary
how long the arrows should be? if its 70 pounds bow whats the draw length?
What type of string did you use?
How long will the pvc last before it's at risk of shattering? Should I always wear gloves and safety glasses when using this bow?
Awesome vid, dude.
Can't u just use the label on the pvc to find the center
you seem good enough at this to do a tutorial video on how to properly aim/fire a bow just saying...
nice keep it up
now......I'm fucking excited
WHAT THE HICKEDYHECKEDYHECK IS A GOSH DARN DRIVEWAY MARKER
bro your videos are fucking epic seriously you have a gift bro
he stole the fing Idea from CRAZYRUSSIANHACKER
Anyone know if there's a certain width that para chord should be?
I heard as a child that Marco Polo had similar issues with Chinese bow weights. Try notching the arrow and hold by right ear. Then push with left arm, and you may get full draw.
the would happen if the fiberglass break
Could it take down a deer?
do u need the highway markers or not
you have nice british weather lol
Recurve Bow is  preloaded with limb tension there fore every inch drawn back stores more energy more evenly though the full draw cycle.. Your longbow version will take 2 or 3 inches of pull back before limbs start storing useful energy and as you have trouble drawing bow to full draw you are losing more draw length distance and energy.  Result similar power output. If longbow could be pulled back by the  hulk 100% it should be better. But as an archer accuracy  is more desirable to power for kill shots if bow too hard to draw then accuracy  suffers too.
Excellent video and presentation style.  Thanks
Draw weight doesn't necessarily mean more speed. There is a lot more mass to snap back which slows the return of the shape of the bow.   You would simply be able to launch larger arrows and the momentum of the larger arrow would increase the damage.
can i have pls where do you get all that
bad ass..  thanks..
your bow is trash in combat. a archer is supposed to shoot 3 arrows in under seconds. with that bow you would notdo that
in love with you videos, throwing stars are still my favorite though
40 pounds is legal to hunt with
Awesome vid, thumbs up.
what kind of knots you use?
do a tutorial that show us how to make arrows  and three stuff you put in pvc pipe are also made of pvc?
i wana you to make a rifle  kan you pls yust do it     :D
could you use tent poles?
Sweet build.
thanks man
how to make arrows
done
what size the the pipe?
Thanks dude I made one. The bow shot over 120 yards. Getting the string length correct is a pain in the ass though. Aloha
what is the weight of the paracord
Awesome Video!
can anybody please give me a viable alternative for the yellow highway fiber glass markers?
will the easy cheap homemade arrows you already made work with this bow?
This looks like something even an older woman, like myself, could make. I am searching for weapons for defense, and hunting for after SHTF. Do not understand what draw pull is in pound term means. I have an injured right shoulder rotator cuff, so will this cause me pain from using it?
Lol this guy doesn't know how to shoot a bow at all.
Are you just putting a giant knock in your arrow shaft to fit the paracord
I'm 11 and have been shooting archery since I was 4  the draw weight on my bow ( compound) is 60 pounds. For some reason this video was interesting and makes me want to get my recurve or my longbow out again🤔
the recurve bow is a non-mechanical way of emulating the compound bow. that is why you are getting the same velocity with less effort
fantastic video. great job. thank you
just download fastbow cheats and you will be good
Ur not that great at archery are you LOL im sorry
Legolas!!!
I made a recurve crossbow using a old wood rifle stock and pvc limbs it has 90lb draw weight
How long is the pvc tube?
what kind of paracord do I need
Zombie apocalypse weapon right here.
the purpose of the curve to the recurve bow was to increase penetrating power while having a lower draw weight. when the now is drawn, the curves almost completely straighten out, allowing the string to launch the arrow with increased velocity at a target. recurve bows were used in mainly the middle and far East.
a recurve bow can add an extra 2.76 pounds psi to 37.77 depending on the length of the recurve my fav is 62.67cm cuz it adds an extra 15 pounds psi per draw
Do you sell weapons?
I'm 5ft tall, how would I adjust to make the bow efficient for my height?
whats the draw length on this
From what i know about the recurve bow is that it was originally made for horse back archers around the time of mongol and classical Rome because it allowed the user to have a smaller bow that was more mobile to use on horse back but had the same strength as a long bow.
Oh love that re-curve bow. In my opinion, yes it does increase arrow penetration due to the back torque offered from the re-curves that go through higher string tension mechanically by design rather than more weighted manual pull back in a single curve bow.
as i see it, the friction between the rods and the pipe might slow down the release of arrow, thats why even tho it had massively more draw weight, it produced less power. if u lubricated the rods tho, that should reduce the friction and it should perform better
Dude my driveway markers didn't fit in my pvc lol. What the heck? Couldn't even fit 3
Maybe the lower weight recurve bow launches the arrows straighter with less wobble? That might explain why it penetrates deeper in the cardboard than the heavier longbow (less wasted energy and cleaner entry into the target media). Also, it could be that your lightweight arrow only gets about 5.5-6 inches of penetration in that media, regardless.
Platform 16 and 3/4!!!!
New Subscriber!!
Is the recurve made of wood as that would explain the better performance
you can only pull it that hard.
Where did you get those highway marker pole dealies?  I asked about them at Home Depot and they looked at me like I had wandered away from the shortbus.
great video! thanks! ;-)
perfect for a zombie apocalypse
Hey man those eyes shout at souls and screams of your own. Thanks for being such a good dude
Hey cool video.  Would you mind sharing what camera you used to make the video? It seems to be really good quality. Thanks.
The recurve bow has a more efficient draw. The shape and cross section of the limbs allow for more energy storage, and a shorter distance to accelerate over than a longbow. Longbow limbs need to move much further (takes more time) to move an arrow the equal distance. The result is a less accelerated arrow than one fired from a recurve bow.
those look sick man !
do you think you can tell the tools in the description
it's a compound bow
The way I understand it, you are pretty much right about the recurve bow and how it has more power with less effort due to your tensoin being not ononly one bend but three, counting the two ends. The higher pound bow should have much farther range tho with better accuracy.
very cool
Higher draw weight does not automatically equal greater depth of penetration. This has been tested a number of times with modern production bows and I believe there is test footage floating around Youtube.  So why are war bows 70 - 150lb+ draw?  So they can fire thick, heavy (up to a 1/4 pound) arrows.
recer has more snap
nice...my father sells PVC. Now I have something I can make that I like from it.
I wish I had a brother around my age
No No No Buy a Damn Bow the pvc will dryrott and break in your stupid face.
Can i use metal  rods
Nothing with momentum but efficiency. Heavy bow is also pushing heavy outer limbs, not just the arrow. Heavy draw weight doesn't mean fast bow. That is why a lighter more efficient bow will shoot faster.
how have i never came across your channel before lul?
nice video mate!
Can someone right me the materials needed cause I didn't get all of them.
Good stuff, dude, keep it up! Glad I stumbled upon your channel..
Hey dude, love the videos! How wide roughly are the driveway markers in diameter?  Also what length is ideal for them? Cheers!
ever think about using a pulley system on the monster?
Where did you purchase the fiberglass rods?
that's cool!!! I followed along with the video and had the same stuff In my garage so I followed along and it is really strong!!! thanks for making this video!!!
your channel is awesome man! thank you for the tutorial!
Dope!! Just found your channel... so awesome
Has anyone ever called you hot? because you are ;)
please reply me with name of all materials needed and it's length 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
is that a ordinary thread ??
so cool dude!!!:)
your "curved back bow" is similar to an composite bow it was invented by the Huns. Compared to an brittish longbow. Soecial about the composite bow is that you need amlost half of the traction to use it and your arrwos will have the same or even more puching power and will fly much faster.
what does this guy exwrsize with cause in the thumbnail and other vids he looks swole, I wanna know how to make some good exercise equipment.
recurve is a mongolian design to increase power due to the snap of the bow being increased by the curved ends im not sure about allcthe details but you can always google it
you looking like katniss holding that bow, you must begetting all kinds of guys numbers with this video.
:)

Why am I here and why was this recommended to me? Still interesting tho
great vid.
you Just made a new Italian friend:) bella!
Ill explain the difference of the recurve bow from you're heavier long bow style. Recurve bows are designed to launch an arrow at a fast and powerful speed with a lower draw weight making it easier to use.Longbows are the superior of the two but requires a much higher skill base to use it properly. Because they require a higher level of training and take more time to effectively use them recurves became more popular with many cultures. The perfect example of this would be the English longbow who were renowned and feared because of the power and effectiveness the bows were, but the reason the french didn't use longbows was because of the skill requirement and the time it took to train the archers.
Can you be my husband ? Lol
if you will ingest some dried psilocybin mushrooms the mystery of the recurve will manifest itself to you.
My bow broke at the edge of the fiber glass in the middle of a draw. I mean it broke at the pvc. :/ wtf that's some faulty ass pvc.
Using Paracord will severely limit the speed of your arrows. try restringing your bows with real bow strings and your will be amazed at the difference.
can you send me the list of things I need to make it
are those feathers or plastic at the end of the arrow
Make a blowgun
Anyone know where i can pick up those fibrglass markers in Australia? been looking around but can't find them anywhere
Recourve has more constant release of power (because leverage getting longer during pull) and by that more acceleration during release. You can measure this by checking the drawwayght in different pull positions in comparison to another bow.
what do you figure the draw wieght to be?
I saw this chase of those muscles 😍😍
I freaking love you
damn this is awesome
I believe that is CPVC, not just PVC that you're using. I had to learn to make the distinction when I was building boffer weapons. PVC has a thinner wall (by 50%) and is much less flexible and more fragile as a result.
Ta chido
Very good video, can someone please tell me the names of the things used to make the bow? I'm not very good at English and I don't know the names of those things in Spanish. Greetings from Mexico!
Great video, wish I could still do some archery as I would definitely have a go at making a bow.
My brother told me to watch this look for something in the mail from nemo
Dude, I love this idea. And you have a great voice for tutorials. Not boring, but not harsh. I actually came here looking for a mod for Fallout 4 that would introduce bows to the game, but now I want to have one of these for myself.  I have a couple questions, but forgive me if I sound like a noob. I would like to take up archery as a hobby, but bows and lessons are expensive. First, Is it practical to learn archery from the internet, using free tutorials and videos? I'm not looking to become an expert fast or anything, I just want to learn to do it and practice casually, as a hobby. Second, could I use a bow like this to learn, or would that cause problems?
you earned my subscription, great idea man.
I made a bow gun with crutches. you should make one.
where we can buy that yellow thing
what is the yellow thing
can anyone tell me what can i use instead of fiberglass,there is none to buy where i live...? can i use wood ot smthing idk ?
how do you make the arrows?
Does this bow suffer from bad parallax?
What is the recurve bow made of?
and the arrows how did u make them?
How do you make the arrows
Pretty darn cool man!  Thanks
Great channel survivalists and zomb. Apoc. nuts
Recurve bows can have the same power as a long bow but with almost half the size. I would also be careful with shooting a really light arrow on a heavy bow. It might break the arrow, that gets nasty quick
he kinda looks like leafy
cool good work
This is what y'all should do if y'all don't have license for a gun
Old English archer's bows had an average draw weight of 200 POUNDS. Those were some tough tea drinking, poetry, writing dudes
why couldn't you use the fiberglasss rods for arrows
the recurve is badass
Nice
think I could use wood instead of fibreglass on the inside?
the strong bow pushed the back end of the arrow more and making the arrow unstable during flight..  45pound worked well on that arrow, the 75pound bow would surely work better with a different arrow.. i don't know how to explain it, but it has something to do with "Momentum" of the arrow leaving the bow
this guy is genius
so, it's an encased bundle bow... that works!
why use a release aid?
recurve bow does so that you get more power with les energy given into
i used this method of making bows to make a 10-foot ballista.  the draw weight was well over 300 pounds.
So if you wanted to add more draw weight, say like six sticks, would you use full length ones or cut those in half aswell?
can you tell me sticks you used in this bow there are any option to it I mean any other sticks can give it good strength ??? because in my town this sticks are not available so please give me option to it..
Fast bow! Those arrows really move. Good on you.
Just made my own bow witha few minor adjustments but great help thanks. now to make some arrows.
He looks like a buff leafyishere
would love to see more about the recurve bow and the monster bow
Ugh splinters
What do you have to cover your forearm for protection from the string? I can't make out what it is.
Can anyone tell me the measurements of these driveway markers / fibreglass rods are?
i like the ending
Why cut the fiber glass? why not just put 4 full rods inside the pipe?
how to make one out of wood next video pls.
hey huge fan can you tweek your videos in the future with tips and cautions at the end
Sweet, sweet video.  I'm stoked about this bow design!   Yes, the recurve design is more efficient in terms of arrow energy vs. full draw weight.  The energy stored in the bow is a function of it's draw weight at EVERY point in the draw.  The recurve has what's referred to as a "plump" draw curve, meaning the draw weight goes up sooner in the draw, storing more energy for a given full draw weight.  The "Bowyer's Bible" series goes into this in detail.  It's easier to understand once you see some draw weight vs draw length graphs.
holy shit its leafy!  good vid my dude
how long are the fiberglass rods?
how would you go about making a paracord handle and arrow rest
is it possible to make arrows with the highway markers???
its called "let off weight"  i have a compound that has a 40 lb draw weight, however, it has a 80 lb "let off weight"
how much was the tiny hacksaw
but is there an easy-ish way to make the arrows for it?
dude teach us the recurve bow
can I make it without the fiberglass rods?
ok did anyone say "oh god those arms"
how thick does the fiberglass have to be?
what is the thing that needed ?
what is the thing that needed ?
The recurve bow is what the mongolians used against people in medival times.They were strong and short which made it easier to ride horses and shoot.
Like Turkish bows.
What weight of paracord? 550 or 750?
Is that powerful enough to kill a deer
Hi and thanks for the video.  About the fiberglass markers, do you bind them inside the pvc in a certain way or you just put them there and the curve keeps it in place?  Also, about the arrows, can you use pvc rods with sharpened point?  Thanks!!
what is the thickness of the fibre glass rod
would a 1/4th inch 1 inch diameter be good?
with recurve bows they are set (made for) at a draw length once you go past that it stacks ( increase the weight) so you can be firing the arrow with more power if the bow is for someone with a shorter draw length then you
Recurve ends move in an arc and roll up the string a bit. It accelerates as it curls back up.
you are correct, recurve bows have more power for less draw weight clmpared to long bows
but how can i make some hunting arrows
nice idea man .. good work
Where'd you get the driveway markers?
how thick and long are the fibre glass rods?
georgia
What knot is that or HOW more specifically do I do it?... I'm stuck on this step and I know nothing about knots.
If I fired a glock from mars, it could hit that forhead
intreasting!!  recurve bow, plz try to make!!
I'd Really like to know how to make that Monster Bow. I made my own bow a while back with 1/2 in. pvc and used telephone wire (it had a clear plastic-rubber coating on it and i just kinda called it that) and it gave me a draw weight of 30lbs.
what size PVC?
does this guy work out or did the muscles just come from shooting bows?
Can I replace the fiberglass with something else
Now he's 21
have you tried well apparently not but making a wood bow
what lengths are your fiberglass rods?
where could you get the yellow rods
Lol. Yeah I did this also back in 86 when I was a teenager. I also had used 1 inch pvc pipe cept the one I found (It was laying on the ground along the side one of the neighborhood houses) was like 7 foot long. Didnt think it would it work until I strapped some rope on each end. (I did it crappy and just put notches, then tied the rope thru it put a knot within the notches and wound the rest around the head)  Since my version was somewhat weaker then yours (without the added fiber glass rods) I had shot an arrow that I had found in the middle school field and was amazed at how far the damm thing shot! I shot it in an elementary field in the evening (with some dudes that didnt think it would work) and it shot it thinking it wouldnt make the field distance (about a football field)   So I aimed up bout a 45 degree and the thing went over the field, over the school fence, and into the woods never to be found again. Lol, the other cats were amazed and then pissed I had lost the only one arrow to use. (didnt know how to make arrows)  Good thinking on using the extra fiber glass rods, I might make one also using your method.
Arrows for the bow?? What notch size do you get??
What knot did u use
awesome that ur doing more videos I wanna get into archery
god: he's recording Let's Make It Rain bitches
the big one is skary do make full draw
ZNA, a pvc bow using heat to make is more powerful than a pvc bow without heat like the one above??
Lol when I tried stringing mine, the pvc snapped...
how long was the rod
it's the velocity for more power over distance
Cool.☺
DAYUM he fit xD
or what can i use instead of fibreglass
Where do you get driveway markers from in perth?
great video man!!!
this man got 💪
You wanted to draw a straight line on the pipe. I faced the same problem when i wanted to cut a pipe along the length. You either needed a flat surface with an adjustable height-block or a straight v-groove and then I noticed that the door frame had a straight notch all the way ..........
can i have one of your bows!?!? tjey are so cool
subbed
:O  A recurve bow is a bow with limbs that curve away from the archer when unstrung. ... Recurved limbs also put greater strain on the materials used to make the bow, and they may make more noise with the shot. Really well made stuff, cool.
cool
The power of a bow isn't only affected by the maximum force needed to pull the string back, but also the force needed to pull the first bit. The recurved bow does a great deal of pull-back in the beginning, while the simple bow is extremely easy to pull back the first bit even if it's really stiff.   The recurved bow is basically a shorter bow before you pull it back, and it becomes longer and lower, so that it gets easier (or almost the same) to pull back the longer back you pull it.
What's the song?
+ ZNA i was looking online for pvc and i found some on menards but i was just wondering what thickness was the pipe you used and is thicker pipe better to use?
All of the items you list in the first minute of the video cots WAY more than $10.
good job
This is the video that make me like your channel, good work.
666 dislikes!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!
I have the same tank lol
This is impressive
i am gonna buy but you can put it in thw box becuase i am on the philipines but i got $10
very cool, but what was that bf all about at the end?!
I usually have thin pvc on the outside and a thicker pvc pipe on the inside, it does deform eventually tho
you can make a good bow without the fiberglass by sliding another pvc pipe into the bigger one
+ZNA Productions This is a great video, thanks. I've always wanted a bow but a recurve or normal bow is like 75 around where i live. If i could make it myself for cheaper, that'd be great just didn't know how. Always been very well hand-eye coordinated, do you use throwing weapons too? Also, how would you say you aim? Do you actually aim your shots or feel them out by shooting on instinct? Always felt the ladder works best for me.
The point of a normal recurve bow is to get additional power out of the same length of the same material.  Normal bows would use a straight length of wood, which you bend for power.  With a recurve bow you take an already curved bit of wood, *bend it in the opposite way to string it* (thus the re-curve part), and so you're actually bending it farther than the straight wood, since it's starting point is curved forward.  So, it'd be like this: *-( <- you holding the unstrung bow *D <- you holding the strung bow, it hasn't rotated, it's bent backward.  Not sure if your subscriber bow was shaped already re-curved, or if it's genuine.  Either way, power is still based on draw weight, you just get more draw weight out of the same length of the same material.
Is it safe ,could it break easy
hahahahaha this guy in the end xDDD
Hi, Im Joel Acosta, i want to ask you if i can make a spanish subtitled video, wich i will use to teach something interesting to Dominican Boy Scouts. It won`t be used for personal gain unless you authorize me to upload it to youtube or send you the subbed video beforehand.
a recurve-bow is said too be easier on beginners. When the curved arms of the bow return to their resting point they give the arrow an extra push and ease out some mistakes done by the archer at releasing the arrow...I however (also a beginner) love my 35 pound  english longbow. Yes I don't hit that often in comparison with a recurve bow and I loos my strengh quicker than with a not so powerful bow, but I enjoy the challenge.
Recurve bows are less draw weight but have stronger shots. A 45 draw weight recurve vs a 45 draw weight longbow the recurve would strike harder but the shot would flatten out much fatser. Recurve bows are lighter draw weight in trade for a flatter shot.
Well crap. I know what I''m doing tonight.  Going to Home Depot.... LOL
The curve bow make it easier to pull back
what are all the tools that u need to make this bow ?
Aaaaand subscribed.
those bows are pretty sweet ..  you've gained a sub my friend.. this is pretty interesting
i love archery
recurves have more power than longbows but have less range
could you please write the tools and the inches for making that bow im very fascinated about making my own bow i would be entirely greatful to you and very nice bows
You got creativity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro I just build mine. I need about 30-50 pound to launch a arrow. I want to know why
xD Best intrusion on a video EVER !
Dude...wear a damn handguard....especially on an improvised bow.
How long will a bow like this last?
What's the size of pvc and fiberglass
u should go to olympics man
where to get the carbon fibre?
im going to get the stuff today can i buy thoes drive way markers
nice I never saw a man makes all these wepones
What does PBC means?
i make pvc bows all kinds and shapes i only have like 4 vids in my channel but not making them only presenting them. take a look i also sell em :)
The recurve adds extra potential to the forward spring of the bow while not adding an intense amount of draw weight
Brilliant!
The acceleration of the arrow slows considerably with the normal bow as it relaxes.. On a recurve, the recurved arms continue to accelerate the arrow when the bow is nearing vertical.
l have heard from some sources the recurve bow was used to fire a bow from horseback.  However I am no expert so don't completely take my word for it.
You've probably already figured it out, but the re-curve transfers energy to the arrow better.
the ending lmao
Looks like 🍃
Can you pls tell the dimenzions of pvc and fiberglas sticks ?
Sweet
yes i want to make the recurve
Draw from the middle with the big one
what can replace fiber glass
Wait is this guys name eli???? Cuz uuuhhh thats my name
What diameter of pvc was used for the subscriber recurve bow?
ive tried making a pvc bow it snaps with out fiberglass rods
what about arrows
can u please make a list of the materials you used, all of it?? so I can buy here in the Philippines??..
Anybody else think he is gorgeous?
damn bro, thats pretty fn cool
will anything other then pear cord work like some sort of metal wire
too much weight in the limbs on the 70lb
that thumbnail tho 👌👌👌
hey zna productions i made a pvc bow but i only used pvc and  paracord and a knife my pvc broke 2 weeks ago
I just out to HomeDepot got the equipment and made my own bow. I was actually gonna buy one from the store...so thanks.
Be careful. PVC pipe is not very strong when affected by tension. This is a really cool idea, and it does work, but I wouldn't recommend using a tool such as this for any extended amount of time without necessity warranting it. I myself made one of these bows and had the pipe give as i drew the string. There is a lot of elastic energy pent-up in a device such as this, and any mishap could lead you to minus one eyeball.
i made a silencer for my glock. better than spending a couple hundred
I assume that integrated sum of Force x Time can be larger, because that's what decides a bow's acceleration during launching or initial speed at the point of releasing. gr8 video
I keep watching this over and over
Just use your bow to murder that guy who keeps entering...
I think the recurve has more leverage or something
you werent holding your bow center but you did with the recurve. plus if ever tried to string a recurve its a bitch because of the way its shaped it takes more force to string it than a long bow.
Dude not boring. Very interesting
He's ready for a zombie apocalypse
Just made the bow and I got to say, it works pretty damn well. Thanks for the vid.
how do u make a arrow
use a heat gun
I want a bow arrow
are you gay
Like when u bend it!
Won't the bow break?
what kind of string is that?
35 pounds?! Mine cost 100 bucks and can only handle 25...
Did exactly what  he said  except I used 4- 57" fiberglass rods & it weight ought at 50lbs.. I love this thing, thanks for this video!👈😀👉 & i spent $0 because I had it all already! A very cool idea for FREE!
Only here for zombie survival shit
Is it safe to assume that giant bow is made the same way as the one in this video? Just bigger?
I made the bow. It worked great for the first day and a half, then the pvc shattered :(. Fortunatly, the string and fiberglass were perfectly fine. I'm gonna make it one more time and see what happens.
make a Japan Samurai bow pls
are u gay? *just asking*
Im gussing the arrows youre using are target arrows, and you said they were pretty light, so id make a random guess and say you might have gotten to the arrows terminal velocity. Maybe..?
Whats the knot called I need to look it up
Would it be a bad idea to try to add some sort of arrow rest? I'm really not a fan of resting arrows on my finger.
Hey man, this is just a question about the arrows.  The weight and stiffness and gauge of an arrow dramatically affects the speed and power it will produce with bows of different draw weight.  Do you think a stiffer and heavier gauge arrow would take better advantage of the heavier draw weight?
What thickness paracord?
make a wrist mounted bb gun
u look real handsome
what about the archers paradox?
the point of a recurve bow just like a compound bow is more velocity to pull weight, so if your taking down a deer, at 25 yards, it should be, ( based off your arrowhead) more accurate, silent, and powerful then your standard longbow while reducing vibration and its noise,while being a lighter draw with more power, basically the recurve makes the string fire faster pushing the arrow out at a higher velocity with a lower draw weight
45 pounds is plenty enough to kill anything in Australia.Just need sharp broad heads.
very good vid. thanks
Maybe you have to put fiber glass in the PVC pipe and heat the ends and shape it a bit, for the recurve bow.
the bow is sow powerful
the bow is sow powerful
He's ready for a zombie apocalypse
Hello:  your video is very instructive and interesting Please, could you put the measures of the pvc pipe and highway markers to allow a more precise work?   Greetings from Mexico
Great video, sir. Everything from content to editing was great...not too talkie but very clear and in-depth.  Thanks so much and keep them coming!
it does check out bowyer's Bible vol 1 lot a good stuff
That's a wonderful idea to show potential archers a way to make a practice bow if they don't have enough funds. I am an archer myself, so I really appreciate it. Thank you. However, I noticed that you put too much strain on your body by trying to pull and fire the bow. Relax, keep your posture, but don't use unnecessary muscles. Wish you well.
Hahaha, we'll can I come in?
this is awesome man
Are there any other cores I could use?
Yes u are right I read rangers apprentice xD they said a recurve bow is more powerful but it will drop earlier
maybe the 70lb bow is causing a ton of deflection in the arrow.. so hurting arrow speed and if there is still a bunch of flex and bending of the arrow at the point of impact the tip is not hitting straight into the target hurting penetration.. maybe a stiffer arrow would help. Or backing off from the target a bit to give the arrow time to stabilize before impact might help
best bow ive ever made. great video.
zna, can u give me the name and precise measurement of each item needed(diameter and length of fibreglass) plss..i have a hard time trying to detect what type the fibreglass rod were..i saw on internet some said fibreglass resin and others just said fibreglass only.i got confused and cant fathom wtf difference between those fibreglass.. if u give me the type and measurement that would be nice..plss
Look up traditional methods for drawing longbows you're pulling method is much harder to do.
This is not an opinionated subject. Why do you halfwits argue so much about the things you THINK are correct. Took me 10 mins to google the difference between the bows and the history?
This is great, do you find that you have to change how you shoot when using the PVC bows? Or is it great practice before investing in wood staves?
You're right the recurve bow is made to launch the arrow as fast and almost as far as the longbow but with less draw weight however recurve bows are supposed to have less accuracy than a longbow and they're harder to make
good stuff!
dude how did you make those arrows
fuck!!!!
I'm sure somebody commented before I came across this video. But along with its namesake, "recurve" involves that ever-so-important quality about it - the forward curve. Where it's draw may lack rivaling weights, that curve adds a whole other punch to it. That curved flex gives just a little more to the arrow. Like a "double jump" on a trampoline (crappy analogy, I know).
can you make a video explaining the recurve bow?
did u ever make a crossbow I'm sure u have the knowledge just asking
dude, this is sweet, I might make this.. can you get the pvc and fiberglass from home hardware?
great channel! subbed!
The extra curve adds extra spring, very simple.
The strength of the strongest bow is too much for the spine on the arrows. If you had arrows with better spine then they will penetrate better. The problem is the arrow is losing too much of its power by wobbling back and forth because the bow is too strong for it. Recurve bow is simply a way to put the same power as a long bow on a shorter frame.
awesome!!! he said native American not INDIAN
Look up American flatbow. It'll explain why the recurve (composite shaped) does so well.
Ok my question is what type of arrows are you using, did u make them, or buy them,  and what is on the boxes that you are shooting at?
A recurve bow has 4 springs!: 2 curved back at you; 2 curved away.
the draw weight is not the most important part of a bow. any draw wait above 40 pounds is leathle.
nive arms bro ;)
nice build
alternative to driveway markers?
Is there anywhere i can get fibreglass rods in Australia?
shut the fuck up
what is the size of the fiberglass rods...?
Yes recurve adds power to a reduced weight
Is there another name for Fibreglass Highway markers? Are they also known as something else?
What are the measurements for the fibreglass road markers?
A recurve bow acts as multiple bows in one as each curve on the ends provides additional thrust combined with the standard frame. first used on horseback due to its smaller size allowing it to be moved from one side of the horse to the other with little effort.
POOR form, wait till the string bites you....Of course you wear an arm guard... Shoot like that n Youll definitely need one....How powerful?  Measure FPS? People    cmon.... this guy is FOS
try to research about turkish archery
that monster bow would move a heavier arrow faster than a lighter one.. venture into slingshots and you would understand why. its a bit much to explain. but trust.. heavier pull.. will move a heavier arrow with alot more energy as well.
excuse me  bro, what material is the yellow thing??
give him a soldering iron and tell em to screw off lol
where are you guys getting the schedule 40 pvc pipe all I can find online is cpvc and its too weak I want 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch and I cant find eather online from home hardware home depo rona none of them I dont think they sell it any more.
man thank you for this video I made myself a bow today without this video after I'm done it man stay awesome and thank you
very handsome. i dont mind bow but i mind your cuteness. lol
Show how you did the 75lb bow.  Whats the difference?
Best to start with a rasp for the initial notch, also you'll damage your file using it that way. only press on the cutting strone, not the back stroke.  Also, I highly recommend making a bow out of used skis with a wooden riser.. the older ones work better (wood core) in my experience.
i read an article online that said use 1-1/4" pvc...  dont use that. i cant even nock the string.  i couldnt even shoot the bow if i tried.
how thick in mm was the fibreglass rods
This is essentially just a bundle bow incased in pvc. the same method you do the fiber glass with, can be done with sticks. For a more natural bow, or in case of emergency.
Cheap implies poorly made.  You may want to start using the term inexpensive =D
how lbs force power
Draw weight is dependent on draw length and draw length is dependent on the shooters height. For instance I am 5' 10'' and my bow is 65lbs, at 28.5 in. draw. Also what you made is not a long bow. A long bow is a bow that is longer than the shooter is tall when it is unstrung.
what ware those yellow sticks
Recurves have far more preloaded energy in the limbs than longbows. So, a recurve can have 20 lbs less draw weight but more stored energy in the shape of the limbs than the longbow with a higher draw weight and less stored energy. This explains why you got equal penetration from both bows. Compound bows work similarly with the construction of their limb and cam systems. There are 50-60 lb bows that outshoot 70 lb bows in the speed department just because they are made to be more efficient.
To answer your question about recurve vs longbow or D bow as it's also known, a D bow will have a straight linear power curve from 0 to 30 let's say, whereas a recurve will have a bit of a taper near the top of the power curve so it gets a little easier to draw back as you reach full draw with it. In essence, you're right, it is more efficient. Conversely, a modern compound bow will feel very hard to draw at first, but it gets much easier as you draw back. At full draw on a compound, you might only be holding around 10 lbs, even though the bow itself is rated for 100 lbs on release. Very interesting project :)
Wats de inch of the fiberglass
Hey Eli what are u pulling the string back with
I haven't checked if anyone has already pointed it out, but I'd like to inform on the subject of recurved bows. The Turks, Huns and the Mongolians used them throughout the history. It is nearly as powerful as twice as an uncurved bow of the same lenght and material (which would not really apply to the one you made, since the authentic ones have a much deeper curve, but the same physics apply to the lenght of the curve you made). All the civilisations I counted used to be mostly on horseback, so they needed much smaller bows. That's why they developped this thecnique in bow crafting. It did nearly the same amount of damage (in masterpieces even more), while being small and practical.  I don't know how to explain why the curve leads to more tension scientifically, so I'll use everyday language. Think of the tension of a normal bow when you draw it. If you pay attention, the curved bow as three tension points: on each highest point of the curves on the corners, and in the middle. Those little ones make up for nearly another middle tension, making it twice as powerful as a normal bow.   I hope its been helpful to you, and to anyone who watched the video that was curious about the answer. Good day to everyone.
It exerts more force when the bow has curves
I don't think there's fiber glass available in my country. Is there any other material I can use to substitute to the fiber glass?
i like this bow
i like this bow
You saw that from another YouTube
Where did you get your fibreglass road markers from.  I am in Australia and I ask people in hardware stores and they look at me like an idiot when I ask about them. Kek
Work (Energy) = Force x Distance  So even if the draw strength is the same, if one bow has longer draw than the other it will likely be stronger (higher total energy to arrow).  Also traditionally recurve bows's natural curve is opposite that of the stringed configuration. This means that it is already severely deformed in zero-draw, and hence has higher draw strength in general. This allows for smaller, more compact bow of same draw strength as say straighter long bow. I don't know if draw length is longer though, intuition tells me that it would be shorter if anything.
LOVE IT !
That is the beauty of a Recuve bow. You get a smaller bow with less draw and still have the power equal or greater than the Longbow. Plus unlike the longbow the Recurve bow can be fired from horseback
Can this bow be used to hunt?
FYI Mongols invented the recurve to do exactly what you're describing. the extra curve imitates the drawback someone would normally be putting in with sheer strength. it allowed for shorter bows also which was crucial for use during mounted combat something that was impossible to do with a longbow. awesome observations you're right on the money.
make a video for arrows
would fiberglass poles from a tent work ?
I have a 500$ bow
I shall become arrow!
If you had to live and survive in the wild, you for sure could... Also I don't mean to be rude but are you cheap or finding ways to make things without buying it for the full price?
What kind of knot did you use at the bottom of the bow to secure the loop?
A recurve bow gives higher power for a lower draw weight. I do not know the science behind this, but I know that's what the principle behind it is.
make it shorter it make it more powerful
Could I just use Brownell B50 1/4 instead of paracord?
and of what metal u made arrows
what the thread called ( that u used)
1:30- A taste of Australia
Could you hunt with this?
make god damn kunai
what about arrows?
I made this in school and it was SEET
Can someone link me to some para cord, apparently home depot is selling "fake" Paracord And I Don't want to risk it. Thanks!
for smaller bows I would recommend broken tent pole's
Hi ZNA! Great job! What is the thickness of driveway markers that You are using ?
Hey ZNA I was wondering what your finger tab is made of?
Hey man, you video inspire me to make my own pvc bow, but i was thinking of replacing the fiberglass with bamboo. will be hearing more when im done.
what is the exact length of the highway markers?
yaaaaas
what is this yellow thing?
Thanks bro for giving a brief idea on how bows really works
sounds like u live in Florida lol
how did you made the arrow and what is the think you are holding to shot the arrow
He looks like Leafy and Martin Skireli's love child.
Fuck this u never up load anything so I un subscribed
Is it just me or his arm that is extended photoshopped on the bottom by the long head of the tricep
how fast is the arrow going?
how long are the arrows
how long can it last without glass fiber?
Where do you get fiberglass rods
I think the reason why you didn't get as much distance with the monster bow is because you even said you couldn't pull it back all the way.   But the wreaker bow of course looks like a combat bow that was used in Ancient Greece, hence the curves at the end. Yes, I think that the endcurves of the wreaker bow make it more efficient while maintaining a good draw weight, because they pull the string apart just a little more. However, the monster bow of course resembles one used by Native Americans, for hunting deer and stuff. That is the design. Different draw weights and efficiencies are designed for different targets. You know that the monster bow would have a relatively heavier draw weight because it would be designed for facing thicker targets.
Hi popular show! Did you know there's twenty other channels like this one taking from the video maker "backyardbowyer"? You did his tutorial exactly in this video! (he has less than 1 million views on this same tutorial)
what tipe of stick do you need
Yellow stick, what is it ? :-)
Cool
you look super buff bro, keep lifting you'll be swoll
love your channel :)
re curve bow works better because when you release the string at the end moments it collides with the what you can call the ear of the bow - the place where the bowstring rests at normal position. that collision causes another transfer of momentum to string which is eventually passed to the arrow which result in the grater speed.
what is the length of the PVC pipe......
So would if I add more highway markers will it make the bow stronger? Because I would like my bow to be 45 lbs
gonaa make it
What's that thing that he used to hold the bow string called?
recurve where made popular in ancient times because they where able to achieve more velocity in a shorter bow (recurve) long bows where very large (long) in order to achieve velocity making them very unwieldy on horse back, hence why a recurve bow is less forgiving than a long bow. long bows were not as durable and more difficult to carry long distances into battle due to their size/length. the draw was also shorter on a recurve with higher pull weight compared to a long bow if that makes sense. but in the end, the mechanical compound bow is the pinnacle of bow technology using pulleys to make the draw technically long with less pull weight at full draw giving you the forgiveness of a long bow, the power and compact size of a recurve with the steroid velocity of compound physics and a set draw so once you achieve the draw weight pull all the way back, the pulleys allow it to rest with minimal resistance until fired and shabang.
recurve last longer with stiffer arrow than long bow altogether
do you live in ri?
How do the rods not just fall off lol???
R these 48inch driveway markers??
how about arrows?
sorry but if i dont use fiberglass ...would it be still a cool bow?
i don's think that the $10 price tag on the bow applies in many places  outside america. if i look online in Australia for a fiber glass driveway marker there always <$24 for a 12 pack or $2 for 1 and PVC isn't that cheap either here.
lol I make mine out of sticks
can u use regular bow string instead of paracord?
can u use regular bow string instead of paracord?
would old fishing rod work instead of road markers great video
music lenscleaner-foetus
You see those guys from Hammerfell? They've got curved bows. Curved. Bows...
Dude ur a boss archer
Howard Hill said a 45 pound bow will kill anything in north america
Hey bud recurve bows have more power due to the shape of the bow. If u notice when u string a recurve bow it shape like a "u" but u string it the opposite way. The u shape actually give it more speed and power because the u shape forces more speed to it. I hope you understand what I'm getting at. There was a show on it in history channel that's where I learn it. Just and FYI
What size is the pipe ?
I really enjoy all Your weapons! It's really super cool! Peace man!
What does the diameter for the fibreglass have to be?
How long are the driveway makers
very usefull vid bro,so simple to make....  how to make the arrow???
Was this PVC 3/4" thick on the ID, OD, or Wall Thickness?
u look like Leafy
o cmon you alwaays joke
please
Great video...recurves are cool
40 lb is OK for target.  For hunting small game it's work, but if you can build the strength for big game you'll need around twice that, minimum 65 lbs. I took up archery in college for sport.
how i can buy this bow
ZNA, could you briefly tell me that how much muscle power needed to operate in the 45 pounds bow?
Those highway markers might make a nice survival fishing pole
I think you should twist the paracord to get more tension.
The recurve add more tension and when you release the arrow it will add more force to send the arrow to the target
great job and well explanatory video. I have little experience in bows and I want to know if this bow is powerful and acurate enought to hunt rabbits. God bless.
COOL! !!! tnx
Jeff Seid, Or Vegan Gains?
Cool make more videos
I wonder how this guy could even function if he had to live in the wild for a few days and have to make a weapon
what do u call that yellow stick?
Great knowledge, thanks for sharing!
the outro LOL :)
dude i really love your work and i enjoy muself watching your videos keep the good work
Amazing.
Did you try a heavier arrow for the big bow?  Warbows require heavier arrows...
The not so buff matt ogus!
Re curve bow was invented to use on horses, you're welcome! used by the huns against the  romans, same with the Parthians
1:18 Reminds me of Washington State
just made one .... so cool
well done.
yes. the recurve is more power with less draw weight because the curved ends and the bow itself  tighten the string at an exponential rate.
someone can tell what is The yellow sticks?
Dude make the recurve bow. :)
Leafy what up                                                                                                     Lol jks
I shoot flat bows as a hobby and this is what i know about draw weight and efficiency.   Obviously an arrow shot from a flat, long, or recurve bow flexes a lot while it's being driven by the cord. It's essential for accurate flight and optimal power for it to do so. Most English warbows drew at around 75 to 85 lbs but could exceed 100 in extreme cases. To utilize this correctly they used arrows that were much heavier and stiffer, often times consisting of two types of wood "footed".   To sum up, the likely reason your recurve hits about as hard with the same arrow as your 75lb long bow is due to the flex of the arrow shaft. You are likely losing a lot of momentum from the arrow over flexing.   PS the main advantage of recurve bows is packing more draw weight into a shorter bow. Useful if one primarily shoots from horseback.

Would it hurt the fiber glass to cut it with an angle grinder?
hey, you are awesome! I just recently started watching your videos and I love them! did you know you can make a point blank bow in a similar manner with a hanger and some small rope? I was watching this video and decided to make one with a hanger. it can shoot a wooden kebab stick into a dart board, sand bag, bale of hay, and even into wood sometimes.
the recurve is always interesting i had one as a kid that was a pully pixed and worked crazy good thanks for the vid dope videos man!!
Recurve bows where designed to be fired from horseback and were indeed more effective then a typical longbow
Hi man! Nice looking bow, in fact i'm making my own bow using this video as my guide. What kind of arrows did you use for the bow? Because I heard that using the wrong weight of arrows with the bow can damage the bow. In addition, can i get the materials in home depot? Sorry I have a lot of questions this will be my first project in making a bow. :p
thanks for the imformative videos! im curious about making a recurve bow out of pvc pipe and the fiberglass rods, but using a heat gun to flatten the pvc... have you ever tried such a tenique?
What type of string did you use plz tell me
Always used wood before... this looks a lot more powerful...
impressive work you did out of not much ! +1 !!! was wondering what is the material inside each box of aiming ?
That recurve is sick. What brand is it?
What are your targets made of?
Hi. Could it be maybe that your powerful bow is knocking the box back too much causing it to told upward, affecting the linear momentum of the arrow thus limiting penetration?
Damn that's impressive 0_o Certainly looks a lot more decent than the thin bamboo bows I used to make as kid with no knowledge or expertise in bow-making at all...
we get it you lift
Idk how I never came across your videos before lol...I am glad...you would of gotten my kind of wildness in a pickle lmao.....thank you. you are a mad genuine genius...I am thankful. subscribed and I am enjoying.
would yo want to trade it for a bb gun
i no have arrows though :(
angular to moment point momentum
Anyone know the length of the driveway/highway  markers?
Why kind a knot is that cause I don't know how to tie it and I really want to make this
where can you buy the yellow markers?
what is the long yellow thingy??????????????????????????????????????????
That was really cool vid! Well done.
How long were the markers?
"Easy" he says, 4 fucking days later you have a shitty bow
With a PVC bow using paracord for the bow string, do arrows bought from say Academy for example be compatible with it? Or would you have to make your own arrows?
Thanks! Made one my self and it it works great!
ay layk  bet👍👏
I tried it...IT WORKED!!! Now I feel like merida when I hold that bow
Thx very very much.
Nice video sir. Do you know why the arrow tail is much higher than the arrow point when it hits the target? Thanks...
SUPER POWERFUL...  I made same as kid, that's useless for all kind of shooting... it's cardboard box... BB gun shoots true it.. arrow should have more penetration... :p
Awesome!
what did he need a nail for?
that recurve is also aesthetically pleasing. something about the way it pulls brings legolas' bow to mind.
how about Australia where do u find these "driveway markers" they don't seem to be at any hardware stores any where else  i should look or get?
What did you use to shoot the bow I see something on your hand
The recurve dampens the string as it snaps back to tensioned rest, with the same function as rubber stops on a compound bow.
So this one time I had this plastic bow. I never used it so I decided to sharpen the edges of the plastic arrow. I went out side ad shot a tree and it went straight in.
Watching this kid use hand tools is freaking hilarious lol jk
That's about an eighth of an inch slot.
HEY HEY HEY ELI YOU SHOULD MAKE CHAIN MAIL ARMOR OUT OF CAN TABS
I love leafy... you look like him... jk his fuckin sucks
Uhh...What's the function of the rods?
Anyone know what material the subscriber used for the string? If its para cord, what size.
How long are the driveway markers
may i buy from u?
U drug heads
nice tutorial man. (thumbs up 4 u)
I did this type of bow yesterday but the bowstring comes off the notches every now and then. I just wonder if anyone knows how to prevent this from happening. The notches  made are already quite deep.
He looks like Leafyishere. They're like the same age too. CONSPIRACY!!!!!
What's your workout routine?
Dang Eli has some muscle. I should try blacksmithing
how do i make this without the fiberglass rods
holy crap not bad if you have nothing else wow Awesome build of bow out of nothing. I mean this bow will still some damage and that's the whole. NICE
do you think it could kill a zombie??
a heavier draw weight would probably work better with heavier arrows. the arms being longer will require that they travel farther. That would slow the bow down. Long bows tended to be used in war to launch heavy arrows in a volly trajectory. The weight of the head and falling speed from the volly did most of the damage. I could be wrong here, by no means an expert, but that's what I think is happening.
Have fun watching his arms flex while using the bow.
Is this safe
whats a good alternative for the fiber glass?
Hey sirz, please make a vid on how to create that recurve bow. Thank you! you're vids so rock! thank you so much for them!
hey zed im a mexican pvc bow maker and i really want to make a pvc fiberglass core bow but here in Mexico we dont sell the fiber glass rod so i really want to ask you if you can send me a couple and i would pay you the rods and the shipping ,so pls man do me that favor
You really need to keep an open hand when drawing the bow. It gives you A lot more accuracy when shooting, also pull the string all the way to the corner of your mouth.
de que medida es el caño de PVC ? es de temperatura o no ?
hm. he must live in florida. lol one second its hot as the sahara and the second its rainy. lol
it does create more velocity because it accelarates the arrow for longer. E (kin)=.5×m(mass) ×v(velocity )2 . which means that you can generate Power trough more drawweight , Mass of the Missile and trough longer acceleration (E=0.5×a (acceleration )×t (time)2)
Im intrigued as to why he needs to accurately burn paper
I'm glad I found this video. I remember as a kid I would tie a string to a stick and try to shoot a random branch on the ground...good times.
Olá sou Brasileiro e acompanho seus vídeos, queria pedir pra você colocar legendas em português(BR) em seus vídeos. E alguém sabe me responder o que era aquela coisa amarela que ele colocou dentro do cano?
where I live all the stuff he said is well over 15 dollars
Hi, first of all, you video is just AWESOME, but I would like to ask you something, could you give me a list of all the material you use, the thing is that I didn't understand the name of all the material you use so I dont know how to ask for it here in my country. If you could help me with this I would really appreciate it. Thanks alot!!!!
Using aluminium sticks inside the PVC will do the same work as the fiberglass markers?
have you considered painting them with spray paint, just to look more pretty? ;)
you guys are vilent
My dad won't let me make it :(
hye Eli, coul you answer me one question? the hughway fiberglas markers, what's their mesures? i mean length and width.
What state does he live in?
Great video man. Thanks!
i think i know why that is i think its because the monster bow is using power to launch the arrow and the recurve is using speed to launch the arrow so basically if the recurve bow had the same draw weight as the monster bow it  would go way deeper summary  monster bow:power      recurve bow:speed
can you list the things we need to make?
how durable is it tho, is it build a few becasue it might break durable
when i did this the pvc turned into a V shape not ( Shaped
how thick are those fiberglass rods?
ÇÜNKÜ O 75 POUNDS YAY TÜRKLER TARAFINDAN DİZAYN EDİLDİ. AS BAYRAKLARI
My cousin has been doing archery for as long as I can remember. Wait, no, my THIRD cousin, she's been doing archery for a long time, and I've been jealous of her because my parents won't let me use her bows. And they wouldn't get me a bow like she has because they were around $400-$600. So a few days before I went to her house, I went to work on this bow. I did it without the fiberglass, though. It could of been better with it, but it was suitable for me the way it was. She asked the price of the bow when I got there, and I said, "Maybe 5-20 dollars", and she doubted me highly because of the price of this bow. But it in the end, I even beat her with my cheap bow. Thank you for making the tutorial.
Can you make a vid of making arrows, if you have made could you link it?
making it right now! thanks man!
the recurve bow is originally designed to be a bow for low level archers, like for student archers that couldn't yet get a full draw back on a longbow. It has more range than a standard  bow, but its range is just short of the longbow range. Basically, just a bow for archers without the training and strength in the back muscles of a professional one.
the string hits your arm dude.. u never learned it professional eh? ..   while holding the bow .. pull the string and learn to rotate your arm.. just turn your elbow until its aligns with the string .. and u wont hit yourself anymore..  think of 90-120 pounds hitting your arm when releasing the string .. u wont handle it and u get injured for sure..  so pls learn to turn your arm xD basic bow knowledge
What is the draw weight without fiberglass rods?
could you use dowel instead of the highway markers
ZNA Productions could you show us how to make a easy cheap crossbow without power tools, heat, etc
could you make a video of the same design but  slightly smaller
I would definitely like to see how that PVC recurve bow was made made
haven't read all the comments yet I'm sure you've already got one that helps you understand the recurve bow. The idea of the recurve bow is that when it is at its most relaxed the Moe has more leverage on the line because it is a shorter distance between the two points where the line makes contact with the boat. As you draw it back the line let's go of some of the bow and you get more leverage from the line against the bus because the contact points are farther from Center. it is a similar effect to a compound bow in that as you fully extend it it becomes easier to draw and as it comes back to being relaxed and actually increases in strength. Granted the compound bow has much more drastic of an effect then recurve
can i use wood sticks instead of fiberglass?
Looking to build one for hunting. Very informative.
thats why mongolian bows are as strong as english longbows yet their  almost half it's size, and they have similar shape as that 'subscribers' bow
the recurve bow is curved so it's as much power as a long bow but is shorter because of the curves
Anyone know where you can get the fibreglass in the England ?
Make a Bowie knife with tough edges at the top and sharpened at both sides 👍👍👍👍
why the trigger,its a stupid way to fire s bow
I've known about this video for a while but I just got done making the bow tonight, thank you so much ZNA :)
He should have spray painted it
Hey man can you please teach us how to make arrows?!
what's the thing on his arm or rist
how do you fire the bow without the paracord hitting your hand bc i made one and every time i fire it, it hits my hand
so I'm from one of those countries who have 10 different thicknesses of driveway markers (or fiber glass thingies). I wonder what is the thickness of the ones you used?
what string is he using?
woah IDFWU
Here is a little of the math behind arrow penetration power.  The depth an arrow penetrates is related to the kinetic energy behind it.  There are several formulas for kinetic energy, but the easiest one to apply here is the formula for the work done drawing the arrow. Newton's second law tells us that Work=-Potential Energy (PE), and that the KE of the arrow after the string stops acting on it is equal to the potential energy it had when it was released. W = -PE = KE = F*s (where s is distance).  Judging from a quick little mockup in Paint (http://prnt.sc/bntdov), your draw distance is maybe an inch or two shorter with the 70 lb bow, but that doesn't account for the decreased depth of penetration given that the draw weight is just over 50% higher in the long bow.   So here is the missing link: You said that you tested the bow's draw weights, but that only accounts of it's force at full draw (or in the case of a compound bow, right before the cams let off the hold weight), but the bows really have a draw weight profile.  At 1" of draw, it might only be 3 lbs, at 2", it may be 6 lbs, and so on all the way up to the final draw weight at full draw.  You would actually have to apply the calculus version of the KE=F*s equation of (http://prnt.sc/bntflp).  Basically, the force at each point along the draw is not a constant 45 or 70 lbs.    If you don't feel like trying to gather a collection of points and then fit a formula to that collection of points, and then integrate that function for the draw length, you would probably find it easier to measure the force at one inch intervals from the neutral position to the full draw position. Then, because you used 1 inch intervals, you could add up the draw weights at each interval and this would give you a number that could be used to compare the bow's strengths. It won't be the arrow's kinetic energy after release, but it will be scaled equally in such a way that it would allow you to compare their respective power.  Now, if I remember a little about the purpose of the design of recurve bows, the shape allows for a more constant force profile across the draw weight where as a long bow changes more from start to finish.  Source: I'm a mechanical engineer with an interest in all forms of archaic weapons.
a little knowledge for you man. the recurve in the bow increase the force of the bow, it can do more work for less pull basically. So you may ask why didnt every country have recurve bows. well some just didnt know how to. also its a complex thing to do with glue and layers of things like bone and specific wood. another is the glues were susceptible to weather. thats why when you see the mongols on horseback sometimes you see a long box attached to their horse. the box is used to keep the bow from being destroyed by the weather.
is backyard bowyers, better than this
zna how much paracord do we need
OK GUYS I NEED HELP .... i really want one of these and i dont know where to get the supplies in dubai ... i dont go for online shopping so can you all suggest me a few stores where i get  1. pvc 2.parcord 3. fiberglass 4.handcutter 5. that cutting thing on the pvc ........  also what can i use as a arrow ?? and where do i get the supplies   ALSO IS IT ILLEGAL TO HAVE A GOOD BOW AND ARROW IN DUBAI ????
yea ik how u feel about fiberglass cuz i made nunchucks outbof it and splinters got all over me
Well you earned my subscription! I never knew how easy it was to make such a powerful and accurate bow!
particulate mask when working with fiberglass.
Does ur brother have an account
For a whole year i carved a wood planks with a knife for fun. At fist i was getting frustrated with its curving. But evantualy i made a wooden sword that looked like a curved Katana and could actually cut through various things (wood,  acidently cut myself with it, and if swung right metal. I accidently broke it though and started to try to make a new one out of metal. Your vids are great and inspiring keep up the good work!
+ZNA Production what do you have on your hand when your firing a bow?
Mate, your haircut is shit, the rest is fine and you're talented. Not hating, just saying ;)
he is petty cool
tbh i thought the fiberglass core was genius. it works just like leaf springs on a car
damn buddy, you would survive a zombie apocalypse..
Do you have a tutorial on the bracer you used to fire the bow?
can you list the things we need to make?
great vid
Hello I just made this bow that you showed but do I keep it strung? or do I take the string off after I finish using it
recurve allows for more snap at the end of the launch while keeping the bow a smaller size.  smaller bow, similiar power.  they were also much easier on horse back
do you need the high way markers or is there any other substitute
whats fiberglass
should the bow be unstrung after use? or will it keep its flexibility strung 24/7?
That's really cool. How would you compare to the longevity of a bow made of these materials vs a standard wooden bow?
What about the arrows? About what length should I use with this bow? Could you make another tutorial on how to make arrows? (Specifically practice ones.)
that thumbnail tho ¬w¬
What kind of cord did you use?
Hey ZNA, I just finished up a bow of my own using this video. It works really well, and is great for when I don't want to use my compound, or when a friend is over. I just wanted to thank you for making this video and many others! I can't wait to make other builds!
maybe the curved bow flus straighter so it creates less drag where as the one you just made wobbles in mid air.
LOOSE!  -RAMSESY BOLTON
Dude, I already know how to make a bow. The only problem is, there is no arrows available in our City. And I'm kinda Improvising my arrows and it is just not stable, its heavy and if I release it from the bow, The other end were the feathers is goes to the front. it flips.
LIKE! just  because you lean too cool to bend the arrow
If you got a thicker pvc pipe wouldn't the draw weight become higher making the rods inside not very useful? Let me know
man the resemblance to @leafyishere is uncanny
smoke weed every day tan tan tan tan
recurve is a better bow that is shorter it is curved to reduce length.  but keep good draw strength
what kind of cord do u use?
where did you buy the arrows?
I like it, Thanks for sharing
its like a spring action on the bow that was given to you ,,less work more action
if it was just  with a metric system... it would be perfect!
what can i use instead of the drive way markers?
what's the length and thickness of PVC and fiberglass?
cool video. Draw weight is not a proper indicator of final arrow speed and terminal impact. i think it was in The Boyer's Bible volume 1, one of the authors tested a series of bows(like over 10 for sure) and the heaviest were among the poorest performers for final distance an arrow would fly from a 45 degree launch. this is likely why your 1 inch thick bow doesn't get better penetration in spite of having more rods and way higher draw weight. its more a question of how fast a bow string returns to zero on a given bow versus another. also the recurve design has thinner limbs returning to 0 far more quickly and efficiently overall compared to the other(untillered longbow?) design. the limbs on it are practically getting in the way of a return to 0. don't gett me wrong though . love this design for simplicity alone and would totally make one!!!
the curve on the recurve bow is actually to act like a spring.
the point if the curve is that it gives more power
Why did you used a release and not normal finger protection.
I accidentally bought Schedule 80, now what? lol
I'm a big fan Michael
this dude sounds like leafy
was that weed stuff at the end of the video bo
If I make this will I need to unstrung the bow when I'm done
Awesome video man, really great. Did you do a video yet for the recurve? Thanks
how do you tie the loop?
now do arrows
may you give me the length of the pvc pipe
where did you learn to use weapons?
The Curveture at the ends give the arrow that last emph that thrust at the end similar to a basketball ball player jumping up using his calves last to leave the ground from the balls of his feet .
That bow is on YouTube
Pro Hunter uses a fifty or less getting 100yards. Of Course the bow is professionally made.
?
What's the distance. I believe in the fiberglass innards.
Very nice, really. I am not a bowman, but from what I know, the stronger bows are easer to push, than pull. Meaning- you should adjust the string first and push the bow forward. As you said we are not on wrestling.
could you tell me the exact measures of the pvc pipe in cm? i dont really get what u are saying since i live in europe :D would be really nice!
the bend in the re curve and the area that you sting the bow means that it can have a lower draw weight but you pull it back more propelling it faster through the air as you fire
maybe the total length of the string pushing the arrow forward with the curved bow is longer and can transfer more energy to the arrow than the heaviest bow. the heaviest bow seems a bit uncoordinated while the curved bow seems to work very smoothly. maybe it has to do with string tension as well and how efficiently it transfer its energy
haw to make a arrow
Can u use carbonfibre insteat of glassfibre?
Doesn't seem possible to order less than 9000 km of that driveway marker fiberglass in Russia :(
btw,where do u finds those driveway markers?
what is the lenght of the pvc ?
what are the materials you used?
Are the driveways necessary?
Great video man 😎
A recurve has more power because the limbs are curved away causing more tension in the string which makes it more powerful
What are those things inside the bow? I understood it is made of glass fiber, but that's it.
Please show us how to do the recurved one.
So you like bows and didn't know that the recurved bow from the Gemgis Kan were a lot deadlier than the great British bow? It allowed enough dexterity to shoot while riding a pony with the same power although smaller and with less strength needed.
Force times the distance you can pull back gives the kinetic energy you're imparting on to the arrow. Since you can't pull the monster bow back as far, the bow imparts force on the arrow for a shorter distance. That's why the smaller draw weight but longer pull distance is able to get as high speeds as the higher draw weight and short pull distance. Equation: kinetic energy = 1/2mv^2 = force times distance. Of course the force is not constant when the string is released. But you get the idea.
well....I reckon the guy who made gunpowder from his own piss was technically better, but frankly, in terms of a quality tube vid and simplicity, you  win hands down.
yes
that curve bow must act like a catapult...1 at both end kinda like catapult the cord faster to s normal shape... scientificly talking about it...haha... but one way to find out for sure is slow motion...
How do I tie the string?
Bro your arms in the thumbnail are fucken goals holly shit
That ending tho
English long bow on average pulled 200 lbs
sorry it was push as you draw it forward. the line in the shoulder doesn't move.
put the line to your shoulder. the bow facing up and then pull as you draw it  forward. that should give extra leverage on the heavy bow.
This guy looks like leafy is here
recurve bows per-stresses the arms of the bow, giving you the power faster. it also reduces the tip mass, which also gives you the power faster.
look at the curves on the curved bow, when you shoot they bend too which adds power
5:52 Yes. That is correct.
How do you make the recurve bow?
hi there greetings from uk did you manage to find out why? recurve matched the power bow in depth penetration or speed of launch?
GLOBAL WARMING... THAT'S WHATS GOING ON
Thanks for the video. The measurents for the fiberglass rods are much appreciated.
Does anyone know how to get 'highway marker' things in UK?
ME friend HAS WON SWEDISH MASTER 2 YEARS
hi sir please can u show us how to make Arrows for those bows u made????
if a zombie apocalypse ever happens im goin 2 ur place man
Dear alpha, i may or may not have a super man crush on you. I fall harder for you by the second
Dude, who taught how to build all this shit?
Hi mate! I'm from the Netherlands, and there's no driveway markers in town. Can I just take a little bit out of another PVC Pipe, and shove the 'Wrong' PVC Pipe in the other pipe?
can i use the inner tube from a bike instead of the paracord
Wich is the "fi" of the fiberglas rods?
excellent video, do you have any good suggestions for adding an arrow rest to this design?
lmfao at the stoner shit at the end
i suspect that the arrow you use is too light for a 75pound bow and the arrow decellerates really quickly because the light weight makes air resistance much more effective
I would say you need a heavier arrow for the more powerful bow. There is only so much force you can invest in an arrow before it is wasted on heat and vibration.
hey!! whats up? hey man i was wondering does that cord U use have another name???
can someone give me the lenght in cm.
Do you make your own arrows or buy them?
Awesome for the zombie apocalypse
Recurve bows are the answer to portability. Recurve bows are smaller and more condense, without sacrificing power. If I'm correct (someone please correct me if I'm wrong), Recurve bows are the preference for firing from horseback, historically.
you were wondering about wondering about recurve bows, it reduces the draw waiting for the same amount of power making them easier to use though they have some downfall in making.
The monster bow, I was noticing that you wasn't exactly drawing from the center of the bow. That could be where you are loosing the power at. You are drawing more from the top of the bow. Nifty video I will be making my wife one of these.
What would happen if you didnt cut the fiberglass poles, and instead inserted 4 long ones?
Tips on the knots: use  HONDA KNOT for the fixed loop, its very easy to tie in the right tight size. for the other end, use TIMBER HITCH, allso called "BOWYER KNOT" which is super easy to adjust. This combination is the favorite for thousands of years.
amazing vid i subbed :]
Jak nazywa się to żółte coś?
What type of knot did you use for the bow?
The backwards curve allows you to store power in that bend without having to use your muscles to pull as much. Its like a spring. Recurve ftw. Nice vid.
teach us how to make the bow they ket u have
made the bow, works great.
can I buy one
I want one
That IS interesting, I'm gonna be researching the recurve too now......very cool vid
I just want to let you know that this is one of the best tutorials on PVC bows I have found and by far the easiest to follow and cheapest to make for the product.  I will be putting this tutorial into practice for my Larp group in MD, Darkon.  Thank you for your tutorial and I'm enjoying perusing your other videos as a new subscriber.
you're awesome!!
I believe this guy killed zombies.
What knot?
can anyone help? for all products in Europe
I may be wrong but i think the speed of the arrow is proportional to the spins your cord has and not only the actual strength of the bow. Try giving a few more spins to your monster bows cord and see if it goes deeper.
how was the recurve bow made?
The 70 lbs did that because look at where you had your arrow it needs to be centered
dayum....Eli got dem musleys on dem arms do
longer the string adds energy to the arrow the more it has
Hey there. Made this and it works wonderfully. Should I unstring this or leave it strung between use? Will it have an adverse effect if I don't?
RUY WAH GI WA KURAO!!!!
Kewl video!Thanks for sharing!
Great video! Currently making these with my 4th + 5th grade students for an archery competition, since no power tools or heat were needed. What groove size do your nocks have? I'm trying to figure out whether to get arrows with a small or large hole size to use with the paracord bowstring. Also, did you add an arrow rest to these - and if so, how do you recommend making that? Thanks!

Hi, Longbows were used in England for a very long time during the medieval periods and it was well known that while they were the most powerful bow you needed to be able to pull it back all the way to get that power.  The recurve bow gets its powerful nature by storing some of the energy in the bend and then releasing it making it very efficient whereas the longbow is much less efficient but able to store more power... if you can put it into the bow in the first place.  There is no way I could pull that bow back I know that much but you might be surprised how much extra energy the last 5% of pull will make.
Your boy was looking for trees wasn't he? Allegedly?  Haha..
Top of the bow would be acting more like a spring thus propelling faster?
On the 75 draw weight bow:  Try holding the string at the cheek and push the bow up and away from your body.   Englishmen  who used long bows were unable to pull a Samaria bow, which was a shorter re-cuve bow.   But some one was eventually shown the secret>   Try pushing the bow instead of drawing the string.
You have failed this city ;)
Its the real life BOZAK BOW😎😎
who sent it bcus I want to buy a bow like that
what about the arrows
Recurve bows were invented to be similarly powerful to long bows while being able to be shot from horse back.
What kind of arrows do you use? And where did you learn how to do all this?
Nice what is the background music?
That penatrated almost extactly 3 Inches.
knots
what nots were those
+ZNA Productions ... I will explain to you thing about that heavy bow. All machines has certain proportions, that work most efficiently. For example sodium lightbulb is most efficent [energy---lumen] at 600w. 400w and 1000w is less efficient. Therofe adding power is not making it better.    If you want that big bow to work better, you must redesing arrows so that its power can be fully used.
Your arrow may be too light for the pull of your heavier bows.... one reason for lack of penetration
Hey ZNA, why did you wrap your arm after shooting?  Did the paracord hit your arm?
Recurves store more power - simple as that really.
Hey ZNA, I was wondering about how the arrow fired from the big bow with more draw weight didn't penetrate as deep. Maybe its because of where on the target it hits. I noticed the box you shot isn't anchored and also the hits with the big bow were near the top of the box. I think that causes the box to move more when struck with an arrow, which reduces how far the arrow moves into the box because the box starts moving backwards away from the arrow as the arrow tries to push through. I believe the shape of the recurve bow just makes it have a higher draw weight than a straight bow of the same thickness, material and length.  effy
Damn katnis much
The little weather update was wonderful
Cool
How long are the driveway markers?
The spring reaction speed is much more important than the spring tension force. Think of a car jack , it has the power , but you do not get the arrows to fly .
I hate to be a stings but in the thumbnail he has his elbow locked, to properly shoot a Bow, you must not lock your elbow
ZNA i want to make te bow but i need that fiber glass, PVC and para cord can you help me find the supply's
Pause at 6:07 lol the shadows make his arm look deformed.
Poundage vs limb weight is important with bows. You can have a 100 lb bow, but if the limbs are heavy and not aerodynamic, you won't get as fast of a velocity on the arrows. The recurve bows stores more energy in a more compact and lighter package, so the velocity is more efficiently transferred.
you ever think of building a center shot bow or a double bow
Now i need a tutorial on how to make arrows. Once again i don't have hundreds of dollars to buy a big pack of arrows.
Dude i have to thank you. I was looking for a good powerful bow, but didnt have 300 dollars. Thanks again.
I was subbed at 25k... I'm so proud
you should give us more alternatives for the high way marker man.
So, I'd like to make one of these myself, cause I'm interested in archery as a hobby, but I'm...not the most powerful archer. Would forgoing the fiberglass reduce the draw weight too significantly? And, also, any suggestions for how to file the notches more efficiently? I'm not a very steady hand, so doing the "frown" that you do would be difficult for me.
Email me the ingredients
Regarding the penetration of the arrow with the 75' bow--  I suspect that the high power of the bow with the lighter arrow is absorbing too much power in arrow flex at release?  Just a guess. My recommendation would be to snag a couple of heavier arrows and chrono them.  Great vid.
The neighbors are probably like (oh look honey are neighbor is Katniss Everdeen)
for the recurve bow the string snaps up against the curve propelling the arrow more. You pretty much said the right idea.
ZNA, do you have the material list on text form? I, unfortunately, couldn't fully understand all the words used. Thanks ahead of the answer. P.S.: If someone else got it, please tell me.
I liked this method much better when the backyardbower did it....
Can i use PPR pipe instead of PVC pipe ?
video for poor people who can't afford what they want
can we replace fiberglass with anything else
Wow I am going to make on
point of a recurve bow is to have the effectively same lentgh, wich makes the bow stronger, but then again make it shorter in general, so its not in the way when walking and stuff. also there is a point where you have to add so much more draw weight but you are only getting so little power out of it. thats why the strongest historical bows only reach up to about 120lbs (which is already insane!)
does the recurve bow and your 60 lb draw bow, have the same weight of string?
i bloody hate fiberglass splinters XD, once i was making a tent and the fiberglass snapped and a little bit shot into my middle finger, it was horrible getting it out because it was like 1.5 inches long :p
You have some pretty neat o muscles
does it mater on the height of the pvc
Thank you for sharing!
does anyone know where to get the driveway markers
make
Dude, kill the music
You should try to make an Enliglish Longbow.
Click bait, am I right. 😛😛
Loved ur video..almost exactly
+ ZNA Productions to tape the driveway markers together could I use electrical tape instead of duct tape?
what kind of knot did he tie?
Hey man! I'm from hungary and I can tell you: the recuvery bow is an investigation of the asia civilization, as well as hungarian, hun and mongolian :-) it is very hard to answer you why they so strong, becouse of my vocab, but its the strongest bow, what mankind ever make...of course they are 55 pounds strong hungarian bows witch calld bearbows becouse of ther hardness, but you can find many videos on youtube what shows you why the are built so strong and flexible :-)
can you give me it
in case you never got an answer about why you get more force from the recurve bow with a less substantial draw weight.  the force of a bow depends on the draw weight and the draw distance. a greater draw distance means more force from the bow snapping back into place and more time the arrow is being directly pushed by the string. a recurve bow essentially starts off with more pressure on the string, trying to snap back. on top of that the fact that it tends to have a shorter distance between the string and the center of the bow allows for a more substantial draw distance. that's why
no wonder i am so good with bows i looked into my family tree and i am related to Louis Riel (i said him because he is first nations so u get the point)
i thought you werent supposed to use the clip (cant remember the name) on non compound bows?
the elves use recurve bows
no power
where can i find some fiberglass markers?
I think it it is a combo of not pulling it to your proper draw length and you are using a very light arrow with a higher poundage bow. The arrow is not absorbing the potential energy so you are loosing a ton of kinetic energy from that aswell as it being very underspined it is losing more energy flexing after the shot.
Recurve!! Recurve!! Recurve!!!!!!
If you're still looking for research material for bows check out ' the traditional bowyer's Bible' series
what is the name of the string
you should make a bow release???
recurve in the bow is for more strength in casting the arrow
watched the ending like 10 times 😂
LOL at 5:47!  Hahahaha, if you can't tell what that recurve part of the bow does simply by looking at it, you have less common sense than I thought!  People are so brain-lazy these days cuz they're spoiled by Google's instant answers.
Hi ZNA, the purpose of the recurves is the same as the purpose of whip tillering, which is to accelerate the string more rapidly. So here's my guess: your massive bow is hard to bend, but it doesn't straighten out very fast so the energy is wasted. You might have a velocity problem because the thickness of the PVC is decelerating the tips of the bow, or you might have an issue because the shaping means that the tips can't decompress fast enough because they're encountering opposing compressive force from the other side of the bow and their peak velocity is too slow and in the wrong place relative to shot timing. Around 45lb draw is where you start seeing innovations including whip tillering - making the ends of the bow much thinner so they straighten in a whip-like motion - or recurving as well as composite construction (horn and sinew, or yew which is a 'natural composite' and always used this way in bowmaking) and far heavier arrows. Very light arrows are probably off the string of a slow-moving heavy bow before they have been fully 'loaded' with the straightening force of the bow - give it a punt with a hard-spined overweight arrow and see what you get. My guess is the performance of the low weight bows nosedives, the midweight 45lb one falls slightly and the 75lb one becomes more effective. Cool bow by the way.
Awesome info and great technique on making these. thanks for posting and yes i would love to see you make a recurve version
I'm not here to cyberbully or anything but you kinda look like a much more attractive Alfie Deyes mated with PDRさん :}
Shit leafyishere started lifting.  Oh wait different guy.
what arrows are you using in this video
Not to put you down, because ive made plenty of bows like this, but I've found that paracord is horrible bow string. It is heavy and inefficient, and real bow strings aren't that hard to make.
great video!
it's the snap at the top and bottom where the cord is looped that creates the extra force to propel the arrow faster, the faster the bow travels will inturn makes it go deeper in a target, hope that helps
the point of a recurve bow is entirely the point. lower draw weight and faster fps on release.
don't get me wrong, the video was instructive, but your arrow might have been too light for the high poundage bows, it's like taking more steroids, there's a point where it's just too inefficient
I think it penetrated the same because both times it looked like it hit the wall/wood behind it
How to make arrow out of PVC only
Hi I'm from South Africa dude where we don't even have highways! What can I use instead of those highway markers?
Cool video. But to make it cooler..... go shoot a deer with it.
Did you ever do study on the recurve bow? I'd ike to ok know if I SHOULDN'T make that 70lb pull.
Hey ZNA what type of arrows do you use? Is it something you made? Or something you bought?
He looks like leafy
What size pvc pipe do you use
What Is The Rope U Use ??? The Name Of The Rope & Where To Buy It ???
The reason the draweight of your monster bow shows less is because your centre of mass is off. Take a still of your vdo where you draw the bow , you are off centre. Can be seen clearly. This transmits to loss of power generation when the arrow leaves the bow. Suggest you mark the centre and place the arrow there b4 shooting. Hope this helps. Excellent work though . Keep it up.!
What can you use instead of the driveway markers?
nice bro
35
Is there any replacement for the fiberglass rods?
your way of speech is too narvus
Because the recurve bow has two additional forces of tension acting upon the string, the  resulting force is double that of a regular bow. Great video you are a cool dude
what is thous yellow stiks
Outstanding Video..... Gained a subscriber.
Recurve bows were designed to mimic the power of the longbow but with a lower draw-weight. They were made for hunting and younger archers with smaller frames used them in combat.  Just thought that might be useful.
recipe plssssssssssssssssss
noob xDDD
Can you write equipments with measures as a list, I didnt hear you well
What would happen if you didn't use the driveway markers
im not sure, but ive read a few books that include the recurve bow in it, and from what i can gather, the bow, while small, and had a strong but weak drawback compared to other bows, the recurve in the bow, is supposed to cause the arrow to fly just are far, fast and hit as hard as a normal bow. tho i may be wrong.
did you mack thet aro
i am the subscriber number 542,600
Nice man Very cool Great info and detail Will definitely give it a try  Also do you happen to live in Texas?
Where can I get this fibreglass in Norway?
I just finished a Bow using PVC pipe, like 70" lenght and a hairdryer. Of course is very ugly due i dont have bow rope and arrows, im using Bamboo sticks whitout vanes. Just for fun.
Illinois weather.
I like your bow I have a bow. and im going to make a target out of Styrofoam  thacks for the movie
A possible explaination why the "monster" bow isnt shooting harder than the "recurve" bow may be in its draw length and how much of this length the string can transfer its power efficiently.
hi what diameter of fibreglass rods do you use as i am having some trouble sourcing for driveway markers here
"Looks like it penetrated about three and a half inches "
cool i will try it but if it fails and i die it is your fault
How long should the driveway markers be? In BackyardBower's vid he says they should be 4 ft. is that correct?
Recurve bows were developed for light cavalry. Some of the most famous being the Scythians and Parthians Called the Parthian shot and later called the parting shot. The shorter bow was more useful on horseback but had similar power due to the recurve and materials used to make it more stiff. Long bows of course were used by infantry, the most famous probably the English Longbow, which was so instrumental in the defeat of the French heavy cavalry at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. A common practice by the French was to cut off the two fingers used by the English bowmen to draw their bows, this led to the British insult to the French of showing their two fingers in the sign later used to signify Victory by the British. The Iranians and others would cut off the hand of an enemy warrior before release so he could no longer wield a weapon against them, in ancient times. War is indeed hell.
I am betting the neighbor children are not allowed to use that playground equipment!  ;-)n  Bow seems powerful and accurate. Nice job.
where do u find the yellow rods in australia.
Is there anything I could use other than a rat tail file? I suppose I could use a saw to make a groove, just wondering what anyone thought of it.
Lever or fulcrum.
any alternatives for fiberglass and chord?
So if I put 1-2 Fiberglass rods in there would it reduce the draw-weight? My little brother cant pull 25.
the recurve bow I believe during the extending of it expands longer giving the launch a little extra force.... but tbh idk anything any bows nd s***
The reason why the strongest bow has so little penetration is string speed, with light arrows draw weight is much less important than string speed since the kinetic energy is not fully transferred.
I made one for free
yes recurve bows add more power with less draw weight... however the drop off is much higher at longer distances ( drop off is how much the arrow falls at longer distances)
I also like to watch backyardbowyer lol b original dude!
do you mean that 35 pounds, 45 pounds, 70 pounds. is that a power from the bow?
Very well done :D
The 75 pound bow needs a lot more weight in the arrow in order to get the power your looking for. It should be somewhere around 100-150 grain tips and longer more stout arrows. Maybe this will help on your next experiment 👍🏼
The fact is that a recurve bow is design to be more efficient compared to a long bow. I guess it's quite complicated but generally longbows stack the pundage very differently, I mean that you should draw it more till your ear..something like 30/32  if you want to get all the power it can deliver. Obviously it's way harder to aim drawing till the ear but it was the war technic.  I find realaly interesting how some horse bow can be so powerful reaching 100#.  After all the poundage is not everything. It just sais how much strenght it's required to draw it, not the efficiency, which is given by materials and geometry of the bow :).   What I don't like in my country is that I've not yet found these kind of pvc pipes :/  Btw good job boy :)
I wanna learn how to make the curve bow pleezz!  :)
a recurve just has far more leverage and power delivery with fewer pounds. it's lovely
how did you make your 75 lb bow?
As somewhat of an avid archer...  This bow looks fairly weak.   Maybe in a "its all i have to use" situation it might be feasible for killing some small birds perhaps a rabbit.    But a much stronger survival primitive bow can be made out of a straight piece of bendable hard or softwood.   There are many guides on youtube about this primitive style bow too.   Takes a bit longer to make, but requires that you only own a Knife; and it makes a fairly useful 40-50lb draw bow.    This one looks to maybe top at 30lb draw... which is only good for target plinking imo.        If i want to use a bow for any kind of serious anything it needs to be 75lb+ draw weight.
bud you say it's hard to pull the bow back even though, you're pretty jacked, im positive you could pull back a 170 lb bow no problem if you use more of your back and hips when you pull that back, do more of a rotation with your hips moving your back and shoulders with the pull  just a bit of advice from someone who weekly does longbow battles trying to pull the most weight
Where can I buy PVC?
Hi Buddy! Where can i find the fiberglass?
REASON RE-CURVE IS BETTER       If you examine the firing of the recurve bow and the large bow, you can see how the string acts upon release. On the big bow, the body is straight and so the string returns to original position and stops. However, the recurve bow is naturally bent and these joints hyper-extend upon release, allowing the string to carry beyond original position, thus lengthening the "launch distance," for lack of a better term. It works based on a few principles of physics, but basically to make something go fast you need either A: A very strong force, or B: a long distance of transfer. When the big bow energy is transferred, the draw strength allows lots of energy, but some is lost naturally. By allowing the arms and string to hyper-extend, you increase the distance over which the energy transfers, allowing more time for more energy. Energy=power  Layman's terms: The longer the arrow is on the string the high the speed it will have.
Damn he is ripped
why does he look like an edgy thomas sanders
can you cut the pvc with the hacksaw to make the pic pipe smaller?
What is the yellow things ??
check out the turkis siphai bow. The most powerfull non-mechanic bow.
max speed with the arrows
Wow man these vids are awesome. Do you have to cut the driveway markers or place few inside. Any idea what I could substitute for markers as I'm in Australia???
The recurve shoots faster because the shape of the limbs, they add more tension through leverage and catch the string closer to the release point than the long bows. I could be wrong but that's what makes the most sense.
Anything other than fiberglass to make the core?  I can't find any...
Oh, really?  You're building a traditional-style bow and are shooting with a release? come on!
the song is cetus by lensko
I made a pvc bow with a knife string pvc and tape
That monster bow, while a 70 pound draw weight, is going to release the stored energy a lot slower than the others.  The mass in the 1" PVC and the fiberglass is heavy and takes longer to accelerate.   I'm betting that if you used a chronometer you would find that the monster bow shoots around 70% of the speed of the others.
Draw weight? You should make a 120 lb bow.
1:20 Its raining.
Does it have to be fiber glass?
how long are the arrows that you can use with this bow?
Traditional English long bows minimum draw weight was 81lbs but it went as high as 130lbs but they used them to shoot long distance to take out enemy infantry. And it worked very effectively creating a rain of arrows showering down
like how thick the pvc has to be "diameter"? and how long. how long the fiberglass and what kind of fiberglass?
what are the tools? length etc?
hey man, 2nd vid ive seen of this. great design. u can mark the pvs with a marker while on table so there is no guess work. can you make an easy way to store this? or may be a cheap arrow method?
What do you recommend for adding in the grip area? I don't know the term for it, but shouldn't there be some sort of cross-guard thing that the arrow will rest on for aiming?  By the way, the knot I used for my loops is a very easy, minimalist one that's easily adjustable called the "Archery Loop." Look for it in a knot book by Geoffrey Budworth. It does the job fantastically well.
To compute the 'power' measure the force required to pull the bow each increment of distance such as every centimeter and add up the product of the force times the increment. Mixing units: if it takes 1 lb to pull the first cm that is 1 lb-cm of energy, if it takes 2 lb to get the next centimeter then add 2lb-cm to the 1lb-cm for 3lb-cm. Do so until you have pulled the bow as far as you are going to when shooting.  Do the same for each bow and the one for which that sum is the greatest will have the greatest power.  Force*distance= work, work is energy.   The recurve changes the amount of force needed for each particular increment of pulling. The force required to bend the pipe increases as the pipe is bent more, the recurve is bent more to start with so the force is higher during the whole span of the string being pulled.
I left work and went to The Home Depot and rounded up my supplies; then I went home and before I even had anything to eat, I set about making this project.  I don't have any arrows yet for testing it, but it seems to have been a complete success!  I want to mention that once I was bending the bow to attach the string, I found that the bow didn't bend true to the notches I had made; the natural arch that it wanted to make set the notches off-center. So, to remedy that, I made two new notches, each about a half inch toward the center from the original two. So I recommend making the notches as the last step after inserting the fiberglass rods.  Also: Rather than using 550 paracord, I used 425 paracord, which I believe is better suited to this task because instead of an oval cross-section, it has a round cross-section.  Thanks again for the tutorial!
I am so going to make myself one of these. Thank you very much.  I cannot fathom why there are far more dislikes than likes on this video. You presented it well, you seem friendly and congenial, the info is good ...
can i got a bow
where did you get the highway markers from and does anyone know if I can get them in the uk?
I'm in England and 3/4 inc pvc is very small so is there a size difference in America
*Watches video to make sure that you know how to make a bow because you're not sure if the game maker still added the bow in the arena...*
so uh, these fiberglass markers... seem to be quite elusive. I'm curious, did you have to order them online (as I'll most likely be forced to do) or were you actually able to find them in person? I'm trying to think of other things that may work instead that are a a bit more readily available.
A recurve bow snaps back onto place faster than a standard compound bow, giving it that extra bit of velocity when the arrow is released. Most crossbows made in the medieval time were made the same way.
I REALLY want one of the recurve bows. I love recurves... The recurve shape definitely gives it more power, it's like having two extra mini bows on each end, I wish I knew more about how it works though. Gotta do more research!
Could you do a video of making arrows?
Make an axe zna
Great video and great ideas you have. I would suggest for hunting that you wrap the PVC with camouflage duct tape. It would hide you better in the woods and it may add strength to the bow.
Do u lev in amarku
do I need to heat up the PVC or just let it be and bend? second query is that does the highway marker, the longest one has to be a size of the pvc?
could I pay you to make me some blades?
The recurve please!
Thanks man it worked i got 70 pounds of pull , put it goes through my targets
4:16 ottomans bow
My driveway markers were longer than 5 ft WHAT DO I DO?!?!
Awesome video
cool
Recurve bows produce more tension due to the curves of the bow folding back launching the arrow forward
howr u gonna end the video like that man
COOLEST BOW EVER!!!!!!!!! thank you for using your time to make videos they are awesome
Lol these videos are amazing but some days I just come due to how amazing this guy looks
are all driveway markers the same length?
how do the fiber glass rods stay in place? do they stay in place with the bend?
fiberglass makes me itch non stop until it stings XD
someone now all the name of the materials in french ? ( and the measures if possible ) Quelqu'un connait le nom des matériaux en français ? ( et les mesures si possible )  Thanks ;)
Thank you. Very interesting.
Hi! Can someone tell me all the measures for all the materials and their name, please?:D
I couldn't afford the sharpie
Hey there. Matty from Australia here. New subscriber. Love your work. Just wondering if we could get the exact measurements of the materials you've used? Sorry if it's already written in the comments section, but I couldn't find it.
The recurve bow was invented to fire faster and farther than a longbow of much higher draw weight so that they could kill animals with less draw weight.
U look like leafy
A recurve bows tips accelerate at a higher velocity compared to a non recurve bow.
How do we say Fibreglass rod in french please x'D
What is the length of the driveway markers before you cut them
i liked and subbed because of this video  i want to see you make a recurve
i need him in case of  zombie apocalypse
the recurve thingy gives the arrow a little fling while leaving the string so the actual power is way higher... its like throwing a ball with correct movement in the wrist
Noop 3
If I explain why the recurve works better, will you make me one?!  I'll pay.  Think about it... you have three flex points working for you instead of one.   Those end curves might each add 10% more energy.
what does NZA stand for?
the recurve increases the torque...  its more powerful than the non-recurve design.
Is there any substitute materials if in case in a certain country. For example, in the Philippines there is no PVC pipe (⬅️ just a example if in case there is one in the Philippines) What would be the substitute?
Omg ZNA is good at archery!
do you have to modify the arrows any for the bow?
It's always amazing how anyone can forge budget-friendly appliances into tools for hunting, survival, etc.  Come to think of it, is it possible to create a smaller version of that? Or a takedown version?
My go to channel for surviving the walkers.
Awesome video.
its 3 in the morning fuuuuuuck
what kind of rope you used?? or recommend me kind please!!
How much for u to make me one
HELP NEEDED! how do i get the string to stay in the notch, it keeps sliding out everytime i try to strng it and when  finally get it strung it unstrings tself after being fired once. i filed the hole as deep as i could get t, the pvc has almost been pirced competly by the notch (it was nowhere near 1/4 an inch as zna said it should be) and yes im useing 3/4 pvc as instructed
The recurve bow has a longer range with less weight the longbow. It was simply a better, more efficient design.
hello...i'm your fan from malaysia and i interested with your tips to make a cheap bow. i wish i can make one. can you please list for me the things that i should have to make the bow...i cant understand some of it because my english is not good...haha
Its a bit late, but recurve bows shoot the arrow faster, but with less force. This means that with a lighter arrow, it will do better than non-recurves, but it will not be able to launch heavier arrows as fast as stronger, non-recurve bows will.
Each curve in a recurve bow stores energy as the bow is being drawn, and does so without requiring much additional strength from the user. Instead of a single curve releasing its stored energy when the arrow is released, you have 3 curves simultaneously releasing their energy, much like an arm throwing a ball. Each joint in the arm propels the ball forward as it straightens out, your wrist being the last of which to generate force. Recurve bows have always amazed me, just because of the fact that they have been around for centuries. LONG before anyone had a working knowledge of physics.
Awesome video. Now i have a lower back injury not a lot of mobility. What bow would be easiest to string? Any advice is appreciated.
That recurve is sweet🎯
What's that arm brace thing you're using
can you teach me
Probably recurved bow is not loosing its tension because curves leaning to rope at the end of the motion but this needs a research
Does anyone know where I can buy those glass fibre marker in the Netherlands? Or something equivalent?
I made one and the draw weight is about 30 - 35 pounds.  This is too much for me.  Apparently I am weak.  What you you suggest to make the draw weight less?  Thanks.
How did u make the arrows used in this video?
Hey ZNA, maybe you could quickly explain how could i make that most poweful bow you've got? Because I really want to make one for my own and I'd like to make the very best one
+zna productions i dont understand the second part of the fiber glass
How do we buy it
maybe to make your life easier, something I learned as a kid, putting fins on my rockets, instead  of sighting down the tube or pipe  to try and line things up, you can use a door jam.  by holding the pipe vertically  up against the jam you can draw or transfer straight  lines.  hope that made sense and is useful.  nice job by the way
Or just get a bungie cord
A recurve bow is a bow with limbs that curve away from the archer when unstrung. A recurve bow stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than the equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow. thare you go ZNA productions
The recurve bow isn't more powerful. You are too weak to use the longbow properly.
Where do u buy the driveway markers and what size?
If you want to learn how to make it watch the video called How to Make:PVC+Fiberglass Recurve Bow (Mark1)
i like ending video... hhahahahahaaa
did you cut a grove in the middle of it so the arrow has some were to sit
Thank U
the idea of a recurve bow is that they used a lot of natural materials in it a lot of ancient civilization built it but the best one in my perspective is the Egyptian one it shots so fast and it is extremely light but it has a problem to it to make one like the Egyptian did you could create one in a day but you would have to wait 17 months before trying it or shooting it
badass bro I'm fixing to make myself one🖒🖒
those muscles tho o///o
Great vid mate... Like the way you just go for the shot.
how and with what materials do u make the arrows?
Hi man :) Can i ask u something? What did u inserted in the pvc? Because i didn't understood so clearly...
I'm from England and It was and absolute bitch trying to find some fibreglass poles this length! I found some in the end by searching for Tent Porch Canopy Poles!   Check out the link below!!   http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2053587.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xfiberglass+tent+pole+120cm.TRS0&_nkw=fiberglass+tent+pole+120cm&_sacat=0
Yes
but how do you make good arrows?
You just earned yourself one new sub! 😉
nerd hehe
how to make the arrows???!!!???
Whats up with the weather in your area lol
the curves on the end of a recurve bow act like springs
how long are the markers?
I want you by my side if a Revolution type shit happens in this world!!
you should use finger release. you are shooting  traditional with a compound release.try split fingers or three under.
hey can you make a video on how to make arrows without using a powertool?
what a cool guy
The bowstring rides around the curve on a recurve bow. This takes up the string much faster than a longbow. F=MA, which mean that the faster of acceleration (A) placed upon the mass of the arrow (M), the more force (F) it has when it hits. A lighter pound  bow that can accelerate an arrow faster than a much heavier pull bow will impart more force to the arrow. Too many people get hung up on draw weight. A bow has to accelerate its own mass as well as the mass of the arrow. Too much mass in the bow will actually slow it down.
On the recurber bow the pint of the recurberbow it puts more power in the string
You deserve way more subscribers
i think its bcoz of curves at edges ;)
u r great :D
I have a rookie question. I made one of the these and I love it accept I can't use worth of crap.  Why, you ask.  I tear up my arm every release.  The paracord just completely tears up my arm.
For everyone from Germany thinking about reproducing this bow: We call the fiber glass rods "Glasfaserstäbe". They're availabe in pretty much every Baumarkt.
Fiber glass I went to go pick one of those up and I got so many shards in my hand lol
I was told that the purpose of a recurve bow is to make it easier to draw, allowing for a more powerful shot
My guess is that you're too close to the target.  The 75 lb bow produces more  power and acceleration which causes more whip motion in the arrow.  Arrows not going in straight do not penetrate well.  I bet if you back up to 20 yards or so, the 75lb bow will penetrate the most.  That is far enough for the arrows to settle down a bit. Also, stiffer arrows may help as well.
mass x velocity = force  pvc can only launch an arrow so fast. Once the draw weight is powerful enough to overcome the weight of the arrow completely inc will cease to increase the acceleration. The difference in power will only become apparent when you use the longbow to launch a heavier arrow at the same speed as the lighter one.
Traditional bows were usually strung and unstrung between uses, to reduce the lost of strength. I believe the recurve's purpose was to make this process easier, as it retained it's shape even when unstrung. Not being a bow expert myself, take this with a grain of salt.
i like that thanks so much
thanks man
What's he using to shoot the arrow? looks like some type of plier
That is a sick recurve
which stick to the tube
I read somewhere that archers in Japan had this same result when firing arrows from different draw bows. They found that there was a point at which the higher the draw weight, the less penetrating power it had. I can't remember the specifics, but I do remember feeling better about my 30lbs draw out-performing my friend's 60lbs draw.
what are those yellow things ?
Can I dry fire this bow
were at you
españa? alguien, no? ok :D
Hey guys, if you are one of those people that came to the comment section to see if other people could do this project and had no problems so that you could to it, you should! It's awesome , I made one. It is really effictive
how would I make the frown... im new to this stuff
3:15 wow that accuracy
Whos the other guy? Does he make stuff too?
Pew pew
The recurve takes the draw weight down but increases the arrow speed and power. Thank you I am going to start
I Want a Take it
The ending. Earned a subscribe lmao 😂
Do you know other material for the inside of the bow that i can use?? because i can't find the fiberglass rod anywhere.
Dude they're so easy. Twelve dollar trip to the hardware store. A mini can of brown spray paint makes two, costs 4 bucks max. Look for that 15 y/o Hawaiian lookin bowl cut kid on YouTube he makes the freaking best bows
I'm in love
Answering your question about why the recurve pulls only 45 yet has as much power as a longbow with 75 is the entire purpose for a recurve bow is for youth can shoot a bow with a lower draw weight yet still have the stopping power of a traditional longbow. BTW great vid dude
Can you make a recurve bow that's 75 lbs? Then it's going to kick ass!
Low cost powerfull longbow (check), Not cool hairstyle (check). :)
Aaaaaand subscribed...
Hey, thanks for the awensome video! I have a question fo you:where i can find those fiberglass pipes or i don't know how you called them:))
i think you need a heavier arrow, the bow can only flex so fast, but it can move more weight at the same speed because its a more powerful spring.
how long was the arrow you used
Make the recurve!! Plz!!
where can i get all this stuff including the tools
I believe the reason Recurve bows have a higher pentrating power for lower draw weight is the extra draw distance (the recurve allows you to pull the string farther from its resting place without bending the material more) allowing for a quicker arrow
Thanks for the video,I've become a fan of these bows. Ives seen a lot of your videos,everything you build is awesome
Please make the recurve bow tutorial, i'm very interested!
Hi ZNA, I live in New Zealand and was wondering if there was any other name for the driveway markers? This video is great! Thanks!
Hello, Did you go to college and study to do these kinds of stuff, I am really wanting to make a career making stuff whether its wood, metal or anything i can use to create.
Hey i was wondering why whenever i shoot my bow it does a really odd and unnatural side shoot.what i mean by that is that it just goes like 5 ft and oddly falls to the left.(i am left handed) Is it that i dont have an arrow rest? Plz i need help. Thanks
this is so awesome
Casing
From what I can tell that arrow is too light for the 70ish draw weight bow, kind of like too small of a projectile fired from to large of a cash g, you get more power but it compeletly throws the achracy and power
very smart.
Archers paradox was wicked on every one of those arrows
great  vid,  but at @ 3.00 he refers to going outside and firing the bow... sorry you cant fire a bow it is shot m
Where did u get those exact drive way markers, because I'm going to make a bow like this but I can't find any of those in Australia?
awesome video!!!
I haven't really started archery but the recurve bow is definitely very interesting to research about
Hey, what's shaking? Can you give me the fiberglass rod lengths that go in the core of the 70+ pound bow? Thanks.
Great video, I have got a question: How is it that the fiber glass markers don't fall down? Is there any step missing? Thank you.
Who's that subscriber who sent the recurve bow..If u r reading this , plz tell me how did u made that.. thanks
you never specify on how long to cut the parachord in this video, which is the one thing i need to know to actually make this
Here's a weird question, What was your workout routine? Or what diet/fitness combo did you do to get your body shape and tone?
Might be because the arrow is not heavy enough. If the bow is more powerful, the head of the arrow should be heavier
the curve on the draw back now gives it more momentum I believe
YISS
how do you tie the knot
Would shortening the cord by an additional inch do anything for draw weight? Or would it just make it harder to string the bow?
I like how he is testing right beside a breaker
guys, please help me - I can't seem to line the notches! Any suggestions how to do it? (i know eli says to "cite down the pipe"? what does that mean?)
You look like Neville from Harry Potter
I'm so going to do this! I'm excited!
oh please make a recurve bow.
When can i use to replace fibreglass? (In australia) Preferably Office materials :)
after making this and only drawing it back a few times (not dry firing just testing the feel and draw weight) my pvc snapped and I am not sure why...anyone have ideas? i feel i may have filed my notches too deep and the string broke the top causing the bow to snap forward and break another piece but I am not sure. any feedback is appreciated! thanks!
I think I'm stuck on mine. it's strung, but every time I try to shoot, the string pops forward and the pipe straightens. did I not make the notches on the pipe deep enough for the string or did I just mess them up?
Have you tried using that monster bow (the 1" pvc version), as a foot bow?   You could probably get a full draw that way.
Dude u are like my fucking idle
You hold it Wrong
this makes larping even easier
Awesome video my man!!! And yes, the recurve bow works like "magic"! Ha! Thanks again for all your great videos.
quick tip: when drawing your bow try relaxing your left shoulder. it will allow you to use more power to draw back the 75 pound monster bow. just something I learned in college archery. hope it helps
What is inside of the home Depot target box?
I am curious what the re-curve bow is made of?
I can try to explain the diference in power between the rather mongolian pattern recurve and your pvc bow, but I warn you, im not good at explaining mechanics  In a nutshell, It is flexibility. If you watch this video, if you look at the recurve you will see how the whole bow bends as you draw, and how little the pvc does. That flexibility gives the recurve a longer draw than a longbow, as well as adding  the momentum of the frame snapping back into place and Bingo bango bongo, more power, less bow.
You cant pull it all the way back bc ur not katniss
As an archer the recurve bow that has a fifty pound draw shoots as far as a single curve (or simple) bow with a seventy five pound draw. The extra curves are like a whipping effect on the arrow it leaves at the normal speed then when it finishes the launch I whips it forward
Just because a bow is heavier to draw doesn't mean it will be faster.  The PVC pipe is extremely inefficient.  Why do you think limbs are supposed to taper to the tip?  Less weight at the tips means they will travel faster.  Saying you made a "POWERFUL" bow is just a lie.  You made an inefficient bow that will take lots of set and quickly start shooting slower and slower as it takes more and more set over time.  I'd recommend that nobody wastes their time making something like this.  Use hardwood and research how to make a real, long-lasting, efficient selfbow.
Cool.
lol the bloopers makes me want to subscribe :p
can anyone change the american names/sizes to Australian for me please and thanks to who ever does i am forever in your debt
go away evil dogger
I find fiberglass annoying as well.
April fools?
becouse your 45lbs are mutiply x2
where i buy Fibergrass?
Boring, not at all...pretty dang cool...thanks for sharing
hey bro cool video. you mentioned why both the monster bow and the other recurved bow had the same penetrating power even though the recurved is less poundage. the recurved bow has three points of contact that bend and snap back, where as the monster bow has one point. the three points of contact are all snapping back simultaneously increasing the speed of the bow snap back = faster arrow movement.
Pretty ingenious idea for making an inexpensive bow, and they work!
what kind of knot do you use to tie it
Thank you - I wanted an outdoor hobby and chose archery. Your video helped a great deal.
Try making a double bow from Far Cry Primal.

For the benefit of the people in the uk what the hell are fibre glass highway markers?
can you make me one
I don't know the science behind it, but it has been known many thousands of years -- to curve the bow at the ends... Google "Rama" / click here: https://www.google.nl/search?q=rama&biw=1280&bih=702&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw8-OiwuXLAhVEEywKHXdZAXUQ_AUIBigB
I built a PVC bow and whenever I try and shoot it the string has NO give also the arrows never fly straight ;(
Hi, I really liked your video, but I'm not a English native speaker so I couldn't understand those three yellow things. Could you be anymore specific on that? I think you could write the list material on de description area. That would be nice. Thanks.
hi, where to get the fibre glass cores?
The real question though... Why can't your roommate just get his own shit?
I'm saving this video cause I'm gonna make this
What is the thing that you used to pull back the arrows
The curve on the Re-curve allows it to pull harder with being a shorter bow
another idea is notching it  in the middle for the  arrow to rest on but great video if you want to check  out  my channel other survival videos thx
Awesome vid. Making my inner child grin with mischievous glee.
Watch this explode in your face
what kind of paracord is that
saved this incase of zombie apocalypse
Not sure if this has already been explained or if you looked into it but the recurve does two things. 1. It allowed for a heavier draw weight on a shorter bow when compared to the long bows when it was invented. 2. The recurve added a snap at the  end when the arrow is released. Similar to a hockey stick or a lacrosse stick flexing.
+ZNA Productions , Ill follow you when the zombie apocolispe comes
Why were you wondering why the recurve bow which doesnt need so many pounds to draw has more penetrating power than the normal longbow which needs way more power to draw? The recurves in short bows are designed to give the arrow more power and speed - its not like they are just cosmetic extras .. everybody should know that
you dint know recurved bows has almost as mutch power as an long bow... Woooooow
Gdzie w polsce znajde te rurki pcv ? one sie jakos inaczej nazywaja ?
Need to tighten bow string more on the SuperMegaFBGBow and what is the draw length when you shoot, more power(draw weight)=more penetration.
tHE MUSIC GAVE MY CAT EAR CANCER AND ME  A DEAD CAT
I think the recurve bow was invented so that you could still get a powerful draw, but in a smaller bow. I imagine that they are much nicer for shooting from horseback than with a longbow.
beautiful release. I tried it out, and it feels pretty good.
your muscle tone though...
Hey buddy! May I know what are the materials needed to create your bow? Thanks :) love your bow
I only have nylon paracord, does it matter if its not poly paracord? What's the difference??
The recurve "recurves" because it adds, yes, speed (due to the added power), power and of course accuracy. It does this by using the extra curve for more spring power. Though a recurve would be almost completely useless if it wasn't made of the durable yet bendable wood, or in this case PVC. :D
If you want I can make you dubstep mate!
how did  u make ur target
my bow is 8,13 LBS
hello, don't know if anyone has told you this but, a good note for your powerful bow you may want to try to pull it like a long bow, don't know how to describe it but there has to be YouTube videos for it
Neat stuff.
the recurve works by shortening the string (the part that is free and not touching the limbs) so that the angle at the nock of the arrow stays more acute (less flat, like when you are at the end of the drawing) and the energy transfer is more efficient. It's like shortening the limbs, at the same draw weight, while the arrow gets released.
recurve gives more thrust and allows further draw with less resistence
you should make the largest bow a balista
Are u dual blade or Hunter or assasin
I love ncs songs ahah
Thats the reason why Mongols dominated Eurasia with recursive bow and horse in the past.
is there an alternative to the highway markers
Hi! I found this video very interesting and informative. Where can I get arrows? What was in your right hand when you where shooting? What is the purpose of the guard on your left forearm? And did you have anything in the Home Depot boxes to help stop the arrows? SO MANY ???'s I know, but boweyring(?) has always seemed fascinating to me and this great video make's it so practical and within reach!
"45lbs is a weight a lot of native Americans use to hunt deer so it's a good weight" uh what..........that's a popular bow weight for ANY bow hunter?
That is pretty much actually what the point is for recurve bows.
Subbed, you rule!
Hey, you know of the Backyard Bowyer! Just read your shout-out, he is one of my favourite handy peeps.
Interesting video man, thanks. How can you test draw weight on your own? I have a bow that i have no idea what the draw weight is but I'd really like to know.
Why are you us wing a release Aid #1 with no d loop  And #2 on a long bow they should only be used on compound bows
I already have the fiberglass rods but unfortunately they're thinner than what you suggested, can I still use them? I suppose I should have to use more than what you used, right?
Recurve Bows are the best Mogols approved it.
Btw, the drive way markers alone will come out to about 14 dollars
Yes I'd love to learn to make the recurve!
No boring at all bro
hey this is  pertty awsome thanks. but you should really put out a disclaimer stating you hold no responsibility to idiots hurting themselves just to cover your butt
Lol recurve bows make the string snap forward giving it more energy for less draw weight
i would shot the dude that kept interrupting with one of the bows lol
The struggles of YouTube videos xD
the neighbor comes out ouch ya shot meh in da deeek
do you have problem with the driveway markers sliding out of the pvc pipe?
search up tiger shroff
would I be able to spray paint the bow without any difference in performance?
Just finished making one of these. Should I put an arrow shelf on it like you did your other pvc bow?
I'm guessing you've shot a bow before, seeing you are pulling the bow correctly, and have a release aid as well :P
what does ZEA stand for, is it New Zealand Australia?
totally  cool.  feeling much better about surviving the zombie apocalypse too.

Can you write the materials? Your english is pretty good, mine sux. Thanks and btw, great channel!
+ZNA Productions can you do a video on how to make the recurve bow the subscriber sent you?
Awesome vids man, just subcribed!
the 75lb bow isn't even feeling that light arrow. is limited by its own speed of springing back. would own the recurve with suitablu heavy arrow.
hi mayby recurve bow is longer than 80lb one that would explain why shot from recurve bow was stronger
dyou have an alternative for fibreglass? i cant really buy fibreglass where i am from.
I admire you and the things you make
can we buy these p.s. you are awesome
Dude, Im watching your video MUCH later than when you made it. Also, first time ever seeing your content. Instantly I subscribed. you are great man this is def the right work for you!!!!
a bow is a third class lever because when you pull in the middle that’s where the effort is and the fulcrum is on the right. The load is in the middle so a bow can be a second-class lever too. static equilibrium of levers fe*de=fl*dl ; force effort times the distance effort is equal to the force load times the distance load.  which means when you change the distance effort the force load is going to be greater or less. your re-curve bow is just a better lever.
Any Dutch people out here know where to buy all the supplies?
+ZNA Productions  what is the length of the pvc?
The arms of a recurve bow act as a spring, that when placed under tension,  transfers a greater force to the arrow. Thus higher power with less work.
I am making this this weekend, any way to up the draw like five or ten with this same design?
try different spine weight for your arrows and different weight tips.That would explain less penetration with your monster bow you need a stiffer arrow and maybe a heavier tip.
That moment when you realise your English teacher looks like an actor from interstellar... Ypu make a random comment about it.
Dude honestly this channel is freaking sick. I love to make stuff like this too but I don't really have the tools or the materials or the money so I just stick with wooden stuff. But really you videos are the only reason I go on YouTube anymore.
You should do some juice and then pull the big bow!
It would be great if in the next videos you start using metric! For real, not insult intended.  By the way, you know if I can use another kind of fibre?
YOU ARE SO COOL MAN !!!  YOU ARE VERY SMART TOO...
Awesome video! It is clear that there is definitely a loss of kinetic energy transfer with the larger bow. Have you messed with different arrow shaft materials? Aluminum vs carbon vs cedar?  Just a thought.
Hi... i got a question, i did all the steps on the video, but when im going to string the bow.. it doesn't curve as much and the string end up really close to the bow... like onle 2 or 3 inches apart.. can u tell my why? thx..
$28 in Canada... Our shitty dollar...
Just a quick wiki to your questions about the recurve's purpose in a bow, and why it makes the effect you saw in this video. Thanks for this toturial, very cool :)  A recurve bow is a bow  with limbs that curve away from the archer when unstrung. A recurve bow  stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than an  equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and  speed to the arrow. A recurve will permit a shorter bow than the simple  straight limb bow for a given arrow energy and this form was often  preferred by archers in environments where long weapons could be  cumbersome, such as in brush and forest terrain, or while on horseback.
i made a 35 pound bow from the woods and just brought down a hog not 3 weeks or so ago!
Where do you buy those yellow markers?
Ken i have 1
Look at my new Chanel
The recurve bow is probably quicker than the monster bow because of the narrower ends. If the monster bow had the same shape it would probably fire a lot more quickly.
please, i've got one question, can i do it without fibreglass sticks becouse u can't get them anywhere, will it lose the power? thanks.
i dont have any of those things can u send me on plzz
how long is the pvc?
perhaps there is a maximum penetration based on the arrows weight. which is why the 45 pound bow and the 70 pound bow had nearly identical penetration.
where can I buy those fibreglass sticks?
Quick question, how often should I change the string of the bow? Because I have a feeling the string on my bow gonna snap someday.
substitute for fiberglass rods?
OMG I FOUND KATNIS
+ZNA could you use foam arrows on this bow?
That cost way more then $15 dollars to make
I want to make that subscriber bow it looks awesome!
Toward the 6:00 minute mark, I notice you have something in your right hand that's attached to your wrist... As an amateur, and complete noob, when it comes to archery, could you explain what that is, and where someone could get one that you'd recommend?
+ZNA Productions it works because naturally because of the curve reduces around 25 kg of pulling power or 55 pounds but it still has the same penetration in your words or the amount of force that's why the recurve bow was stronger in a way
There is another guy that made a similar bow and posted it on his channel previous to yours. It's a nice idea, and i always wanted to try it but i did not find fiberglass rods in my local shops. So i tried using PVC+fiberglass pipes. They are pipes with 2 layers of PVC and one layer of fiberglass in the middle. They work well and you can get a pretty decent bow out of that material too.
What Is The Requirments??
please tell me the name of the yellow stick
I might sound dumb to experienced bow hunters or archers but when u buy arrows online does the tip (sharp part) come with it? Because when I was shopping for some on the web I didn´t see the tip (sharp point)
Will any arrows fit on this bow or is it only the ones he made???
KATNISS
what are other options instead of the fiberglass rods... i cant find them in my country
Awesome
i read all comments and there is no answer so i have question paracord poly what size? 550lb 5/32"(4mm) or smaller 2mm?
how long are the fiberglass markers?
I'm native it is stronger because it's smaller not as lessdraw weight but has friction I might be wrong so you should make sure
Do you only have the one arrow? Every time you fired it seemed like you had to go retrieve it and I didn't find a shot with more than one arrow in your target (although I didn't look very hard to find a shot like that).
Excellent video!
Excellent, but I was a bit worried when you started shooting at those boxes. Have you ever missed and shot one of the neighbours? lol
The only thing I can find so far locally is fiberglass for kites, will it be good for that project or will it be too rigid (I guess it would be but I'm not sure).
I found this on Wikipedia   A recurve bow is a bow with limbs that curve away from the archer when unstrung. A recurve bow stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow. A recurve will permit a shorter bow than the simple straight limb bow for a given arrow energy and this form was often preferred by archers in environments where long weapons could be cumbersome, such as in brush and forest terrain, or while on horseback.
I need this in my life
I would actually rather use a bullwhip for that distance but I would LOVE to have a bow like that
looks like ur stance on the heavy duty bow was giving in to the shot a lil power may be lost i dunno tho jus n idea u kno cuz of how ridiculous it is to pul back n all.
hi you have really amazing videos on your cannel!! COuld you plese tell me, which was the diameter of the fiber glass rods ?  Plese
My guess is there is more material to also spring back into form. So more friction and pressure working against it, as, for it. so there really is a balance where it is just springy enough that it causes no 'drag' on the rebound? Essentially the big bow is too big to get out of its own way ? Or my second best guess is the arrow is TOO light, causing it to skew in flight? Like you said the re-curve has more spring for less PFS of pull. speed really equals power. Its like when you slam something with a hammer, you might worry you will break the handle but almost all the impact goes to the head same thing. The speed is what makes it penetrate. Impressive shooting by the way. I love bows but you shoot very clean and precise.
Them arms.
Hello, Im from Europe and I have no idea what those yellow sticks could be called alternatively. I hear you say driveway markers, am I hearing that correctly? Any idea on what I could put into the translator so that I know what Im looking for when I go out to buy the materials I need? Also Im assuming all of this can be bought at a Baumax or Obi or places such as these right?
where should you get the training arrows?
Recurve bows have less draw weight for a harder shot
cutting parachord, how would you suggest doing that? just scissors? and/or is there a way to avoid the fraying?
this is great for lots of reasons, but I'm impressed with your ability to be wrong, and then get inquisitive. Great attitude for a young kid.
The research is very interesting. Actually seeing the differences between the penetration depth of the different bows gives your video authenticity.
The draw lenght is the reason why the 2 bows shoot with the same power, its because more lenght equals to more time accelerating the arrow and more acceleration equals more force (f=m*a, V^2=V0+2a*d)
how do you dock the arrow, does it just rest on your finger?
I made my bow from bamboo strip as pvc is rare in my country. I reinforced the bow and its weak as hell Lol. Idk if it's my bow or my arrow. I made the arrow out of chop sticks Lol. 10cm away from the target I can Pierce it about 1-2inch deep. Now that's disappointing
Nice muscles dude xD .  Consider yoursel one sub closer to the milion!
what's that loop called ? I have no idea how to do it
LOL "sorry if this is boring to you guys but this is really interesting to me" That was the most interesting part to me in the whole video
Something about that recurve may have to do with how it is structured. After a certain draw length, the potential energy from bending the bow had maxed out, further draw gives no more potential energy because the vector of the limbs are aligning with your draw's vector. Mean while the recurve bow may have a higher effective draw length than your monster bow, hence the result.
I don't have a lot of knowledge about archery but shouldn't the elbow point to the ground instead of to the side? or was it the other way round?
whats the background music?
As far as how recurve bows work, they simply get more power out of a full draw from a shorter bow. A long bow of equal draw would be much larger but propel an arrow identically. I think you need to retest the draw of those bows, and possibly test your own draw limits.
Not bad, but I think I didn't hear you giving credits to the one who had this idea. I mean, there are videos older than 2013 explaining how to make a bow almost exactly like this one. At least tell people there are other options.
did he say driveway markers?
A recurve bow shoots very flat, which means that at close range it will hit a target at approximately a 90 degree angle, for optimal penetration.  A Longbow has a significant arc when fired, which means that it will not have the same close range result as a recurve.   Longbows were historically fired at extreme range, which added a lot of armor piercing power.  Also, Longbows typically fired a bodkin arrow, which was very heavy and thereby was not affected as much by the arc of a loosed bow as a modern carbon arrow.  Hope this helps.
please make a tutorial on how to make an arrow with minimum tools and cheaply thanks
make the recurve bow. it looks amazing and seems to me extremely functionable
make the recurve bow. it looks amazing and seems to me extremely functionable
your big bow arrows are bouncing off the wall i think.
the mongols used a similar bow on their horses to the curved one you showed.
Because the draw weight of the monster bow has to big of draw weight for the arrow
Are these the markers i need? http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006STTL7U?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_image_3&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER
dude, when you started to nerd out about the bows and how they work, keep that up bro! loved how curious you were, i usto do archery, such a great tool.
um im only 5,1 will i be able to use this?
Hey did you ever get around to figuring out how to make a recurve bow
Bro, be honest. Did you steal this idea from that other youtuber? The big dude who makes stuff in his back yard?
Ur awesome
Hey man dont know if you found out, but the recurve is better with light arrows. If you used arpen heads or any heavy arrow, you would have better results with your own bow.
Thanks for all the info man. As a traditional hunter I make my own bows and arrows and you broadened my mind. Thanks
Hey man, What do you use to make arrows or do you buy them?
how to tie a loop
Wow, now how do we make arrows 😂
So quick question. I get everything in this video EXCEPT for one little thing. how do you ensure the fiberglass rods don't slip out? from what I saw the parachord will never cover the open ends of the bow, so that doesn't help. Is the curve from the drawn bow enough to keep it in place?
60 and over
i was wondering if you could build a p.v.c four limb bow
Recurve bow bends back further and therefore gives more acceleration?
@ zna productions is there a way to stop the para cord from vibrating after the bow is fired or is it not a big deal?
Could I use something else than a rat tail file
globel warming
the real and right reason about what a recurve does is it allows a higher draw weight with a shorter draw which in turn allows the bow to be smaller and still have the same power.
the sub recurves limbs do help with speed its like a classic compound because it has more reflex when shooting
The Mongols used recurve bows.I believe it is used so it does not bump there horse while riding and so they can fire efficiently.
how long does the driveway markers have to be
would you be willing to leave a message on here with typed instructions on how to make the bow?
a recurve bows tips bend straighter on the draw and spring forward on release imparting extra force onto the arrow, giving a faster shot. They were designed to do this to give a more powerful shot on a smaller bow.
Now this was cool.  I really enjoyed this video.
how do u make the arrows ?
Great videos! I wonder how thick is the paracord?
Great videos! I wonder how thick is the paracord?
pretty cool, dude
Make a bow with wood called "kukrika", i don't know how you call it, but you can search for photos  on google, its very powerfull, you can squise it and make a very powerfull bow, i made one wich shooted slightly threw the soda can, for arrow im using " ljeskovina", allso google it becouse i don't know the english word for that tree 😄😄😄, peace
Not an archer but I rememmber reading about pulley bows once. Your monster bow only applies its macimum power on release and does not continue to push the arrow. A pulley bow continues to push the arrow as it moves forward. I would guess the recurve bow has a similar effect giving it a longer smoother delivery of power  allows it to be more accurate and efficient.
"almost exactly 5 inches"
I can't find driveway markers where I live. Does someone have a way to get some in France ?
Will this break after a lot of use
we're do you find your music
Hey man, you got an awesome channel. I've built just about everything except this. I can't seem to get the groove right with the files that I have so I just wanted to ask what size rat tail file do you use and how thick?
cool
Wonder what's in that art box lol dope vid tho
What's the durability of one of these? You should shoot it over and over and find out when it starts to show signs of loss of power and bending so we know just how long a 15 dollar bow will last. I'm think about making one of these but I'm unsure of just how powerful this really is. Can you show the draw weight on it using your scale? I'd love to hear from you personally so I can really decide on making one if these. I looked up the supplies and you can get everything from home depot for around 20 bucks so its not to far off at home depot. Hell you know what I'm going to make one of these and one of your targets and test them out and get a draw weight and see how long the bow last...for 20 bucks and pvc I'm not expecting very long but its so cheap. Anyways I'll be back in a couple weeks....
That guy that send you that bow can he build one for me....?
i can't get my 1/8" paracord to stay in the notches to string it:/ any tips? i might have to break thru the smallest portion of the wall of the pipe to get a deep enough groove.
Did that guy in the end ask you for weed?
Hello ZNA , Why almost all bow makers use hollow pvc tubes ?!  Solid pvc or teflon tubes are way more powerful. The also have flash shape memory !! So I think at least :)
great instructions and video
can I buy a bow and arrow from you and how much would it be I love your videos by the way they're really cool and inspiring
What kind of arrows should I be using? I think 30inch arrows seem right for 50lb right? I just want some practice arrows anyhow for this bow.
can We get a list and MEASUREMENTS of what you use to make the bow
You smoke pot dont you lol you look blazed as fuck in the beginning.
did he cut the fiberglass driveway markers to 5 feet as well?
the recurve is the top and bottom parts of the limbs of the bow that curve away from you to help with storing energy and draw weight
That weather. Do you live in Colorado?? lol
Can I, instead of using fiberglass cords, use another pvc pipe and put the string inside both pipes?
Ey man, your archery bow is awesome, can you please write the list of things that I need to make one?  I don't speak english and can't understand some things you say :(
+ZNA Productions you are absolutely correct, I just made this bow without the rods and its ok. but I can't wait till I see what the bow does when I add the rods
Your information has been awesome!!!. Thank you.
I am trying to make a bow for a school project and my dad want to see what size the fiberglass bow needs to be
+ZNA Productions how long are the fiberglass markers
how much power is 1highway things
how much power is 1highway things
perhaps the bigger bow gets the same Penetration as the recurve Because the arrow reaches terminal velocity? I'm probably wrong, but its just a thought.
I am impressed!
can you guys please tell me the name of the string
can you guys please tell me the name of the string
what could I use instead of using the fiberglass rods
where do you find the driveway markers? I've looked at lowes and couldn't find any like those
what materials do use can u write it here plz ...or someone else
Hey, it looks like on the 75lb bow the arrow is rotating forward more, which instead of going straight in. This would greatly reduce penetration. Also, watch your release compared to the recurve.
For those who may be skeptical about the power of these bows,  I have personally taken a relatively small whitetail doe with a 30 lbs draw compound and a broad head at approx. 20 yards from a tree stand approx. 10ft up.  It was a clean heart shot and she only made it approx. 50 yards from the spot where I took  the shot.
Don't have your arm straight it works better and stops you from getting a crushed elbow
its your shooting form. when you release you sorta swing your arm out. you should be following through across your face to the back of your head
very innovative
how did you stop the highway markers from falling out?
How experienced are you with a bow, you are quite accurate
Recurve is more efficient because it has a RE-curve, it makes the expanding of the string faster towards the end where the arrow leaves the string.  Where regular bow string doesn't maintain the same force a re-curve has when the arrow leaves.  Learnt that 2 weeks ago, I'm a noob.
Lol at the bloopers xD
Earned yourself a new subscriber. Thanks
Is it okay to use 1/2" instead of 3/4"
Great video, I learned some stuff! By the way, because the limbs of a recurve bow are bent forward, it takes more energy to draw the bow, which increases the draw weight. Recurve bows are more "Size efficient", meaning if you'll examin a long bow and recurve bow of the same size, the recuve will have higher draw weight. This advantage allows for making smaller bows with still high draw weight, but the penalty is that recurve bows wear out faster (Not 100% sure about that) and they are louder, as the string hits the limbs of the recurve bow.
reflex and diflex recurved is better :=)
What length/diameter are the highway/driveway markers?
Yes. Recurve bows allow the string to move at a much higher velocity than a longbows string, which will give equal power, with less draw weight. In fact, a 55lb pull recurve is about as powerful as a 90lb crossbow.
love the music on the builds :)
solid stuff man. where abouts r u?
I love that curve bow how can I get it ?I'm Turkish that's. The Chyna bow we used to use in the war small practical lightweight easy to maneuver even on the horseback
ummm all this longbow hate i need to clarify. my recurve and longbow are 50# draws and the recurve shoots 175 fps and the longbow shoots 165 fps, the main difference between the two is the NOISE when you shoot recurves there is a string slap and its  louder depending on poundage. longbows do not have this noise at all.  so if you want speed go for compound, recurve for speed and traditional,  composite bow for speed shooting longbow for stealth warbow for the true badass.
Do you make the arrows and if yes can you make a video how thanks. :D
I should study for finals. Why I'm learning how to make a bow...
This is awsome I wish I could do this for a living
recurve = longer draw = force applied on arrow for more time = more energy transferred to arrow than straight bow with same draw weight.
Holy fuck
The bow is pretty easy to make, cut a pvc pipe in half and then carfully use  a heat gun to bend it in the shape you want
fiberglass splinters are the worst
how come you use launching device even with recurve bow
Hi Buddy! My name is Sundeep. Thanks so much for your videos and sharing your knowledge. I live in India and was wondering if I could use bamboo instead of highway markers, since I may not have success in finding the markers? Any other suggestions? Also what could be good material and length for making home made arrows? Thanks again.
ZNA production can u just tell the best arrow for your pvc bow that u made in this video plzzz
Damn, you're a pretty good shot
I bought a PVC recurve with a 45lb draw weight and it will shoot an arrow in about 8inchs at 100yards.. so I don't know if the recurve you have is shooting it at that speed.
Hey just a quick question, how much does this build cost? I mean with the tools you used included
I'm not sure if anyone in the comments addressed this yet but dude, you keep apologizing for nerding out about the difference between the bows, we want to know too so stop fussing about it so much, it's fascinating actually and I highly doubt anyone else minds you talking about it on and on. Seriously, you're doing fine and you're hella interesting, keep up the amazeballs work man!
The issue when using heavy bows os that you need heavier arrows to get the penetration that you lose be cause of the speed, at higher speed a the material of offers higher resistance. So even the físics sais that mass and speed afect the same at the total force, force obtained by mass has mire penetration by the other ecuation.
wait till it snaps on him PVC pipe isnt the best its not smart in the least hope you hurt yourself :)
Brilliant. Thank you.
Where do u get the arrow?!
pls make a video on how to make that subscriber bow. thanks
Those interruptions XD
gay
The curvature of the recurve bow gives more elastic potential energy than another bow of its size
you need a job making lots of money
Well fuck me i work at home depot, ive been buying shit like lanterns and flashlights. Guess when i have a slow day i can price this up, buy it and try to make it. Im into firearms but im really liking this project. The arrows i probably get at walmart or my local big 5. I have all the tools and id love to make that recurve bow but i think ill start simple.
A lot of people don't realize how elastic paracord is... maybe the similarity of the penetration of the two bows has to do with draw power on the larger bow being lost through cord stretch. Tie 20-30 feet of paracord to a tree, tie a sturdy stick to the other end and give it a powerful tug - you'll feel it lengthen by quite a bit.
How old are you ZNA?
Finally i can go out and hunt for cats. Thanks!
nice :)
I wonder if I can make it. Can someone put list of materials in comment plz. not a native so I'm not sure what to look for therefore I need to translate it.
what thickness are the fibre glass rods
How thick are these fiberglass rods that you are using?
The monster bow might be getting reduced results because of the arrow being too light, if the spine weight is too light, it bends too much.
using a release on a recurve/longbow? lol scrub archer
Lol the outtakes
hey i live in the caribbean and i was wondering if u know where i can the fiber glass rod? Thanks. And your videos are just awesome
Good to know for when my bow breaks during the zombie Apocalypse.
sooo......the more reflectors the more powerful?
You remind me of Josh Blaylock... hmmm
@ZNAProductions bro do you lift??? You look like you do! Judging by your forearm muscles! If you do go to the gym, could you make a vid for that!
what did you use for arrows? can you also make a video how you made those?
Try drawing the "Monster Bow" from the centre of the drawstring. I saw you draw it from 3/4 up the draw string. That will solve your problem. If that does not help then try out the martial arts archer techniques of hitting water for a few days. It helps a lot.
i always found the re-curve  interesting, they do seem more powerful than they should be given their small frame, and as i recall particularly with the hun re-curve, they were designed in a way that you get the maximum power draw using minimal resources. the huns were also know to be very effective horseback archers using their re-curves
gonna try this at some point, did you make your own arrows or did you buy them?
How long is the PVC??
Bu 3/4 of an inch i assume you mean the whole diameter not the walls
Make the Re-curve bow PLZ!
if you make the recurve bow make sure you make the curves on the top and bottom more extreme because it will add more weoght
I have a proper recurve bow, weighted at are 22 pounds ana can penetrate decently through a target about 70 feet away with relative accuracy. So I think until you get to over 100 feet recurve bows are far superior to longbows.
I call a recurve bow because it recurve both ends
what type of rope is that?
So just buy arrows
anyone know the size that the paracord should be
you're a really good YouTuber, I have no doubt that your channel will never stop growing
I can't get the fibreglass rods :/ Is there a good substitute?
where can I find fiberglass?
the re curve bow is shaped with a heat gun. the rest is how you made the others.
Whats the diameter of the driveway markers? I live in Australia and we dont sell them here so have to buy fibreglass rods. Also what type of paracord?
you are exactly right about the re-curve bow... the mongolians used them for hundreds of years and test show that a long bow with the same draw weight as a re-curve will always shoot slower... the added stored up potential energy due to the reverse curve is giving the arrow more kinetic energy... same sort of thing in a compound (pulley) bow but with the compound bow it is multiplied exponentially.
how tall/long are the fiberglass rods?
The recurve is bent to have more snap like force
Have you ever had any problems with arrows shattering on you with the larger bow? I've heard of this happening with compound bows with wood arrows.
Indonesia?
Damn, that heat aint no joke, your tan is intense.
what is the dimension of that highway marker?
impressive and easy - wow - great job!
Are you considering a tutorial on a how to make a  Wooden Bow?
what can I use instead of those driveway markers?... I couldn't find any of them in my country... they may be here but im not looking in the right spots... so anything in mind?
Funny that you added the bloopers. Regards!
dwg
Can i make it a little more short? will it be easier to draw?
If you got a straighter shot out of that 75lb bow you could probably penetrate deeper, but with the difficulty you had with it I wouldn't count on it any time soon.
This guy is gonna make it when the apocalypse hits.
Recurve bows (when constructed properly) offer more power than a pyramid bow (non-curved) of the same size and material. The reason is because the strings sit better on curve which allows a better snap. At least that's what my archery teacher said "those curves aren't for aesthetics."
You should make a bow that is more like a medieval English war-bow, with a draw weight of around 100 pounds.
sorry im from mexico and my english is not that good, so, can you put the names of the materials espcially the yellow sticks and the cord....... i hope i found the stuff here in Mexico...........GREAT VIDEO!!!
Anyone know any alternate options too the highway markers? Thanks
que material é este bastão q coloca por dentro do PVC???
que material é este bastão q coloca por dentro do PVC???
Sadly I can't find anything quite like These things you use in your Video (PVC, Fiberglass Markers)
This is a good improvised weapon for when the revolution against the corporate-fascist government occurs.
what paracord size it is? 550?  will it be too thick to nock an arrow?
dosen't work
Lol the interruptions
Where did you get your arrow?
Can't seem to find the driveway markers anyway. Is there any material or item that I can replace the m with? Thank you.
Hi, Thanx for Sharing This Knowledge. I have a Problem, As i live in a Town in India, i dont have a Luxury to use Driveway Markers so plz suggest me a different thing or material which i can use Instead. Please. Thank you.
Cani get a link for the recurve bow? Plz
Ok, so the road markers are not available in many european countries, and I'm trying to find something non-carbonic to replace them with. Can anybody help me with this?
Bow tuning is something to think about a bow penetration has a lot to do with how straight it releases the arrow most likely is the recurve is throwing the arrows much straighter making them penitrate more efficiently than ur 70 lb bow. U will probably have different results with heavier stronger arrows because they won't flex as much making them fly straighter
Why don't you make a wood bow
recurves is a physics thing kinda like the compound bow.  that recurve at the end does not add weight to your draw but it does add weight upon firing (im shit at explaining this) basicly the curve of a recurve acts like the cams of a compound bow only no where near as good.
bon idee
make the re-curve
was watching n it looked like you weren't pulling frm center...
hey i was thinking to making a heated bow but when i see this i said wow just wow how i can make this can you measure me of the cm pvc pipe thickness and the rods thickness also what string is this like a normal string that they use on normal bows  ? pls send me pm or whatever you want :)
the curves on the recurve bow gives it a higher out put of force qhen you shoot it than a long bow or some others I loke recurve because it can literally REPLACE compound AND long bow if need be. all the power you need and still dedly acvirate
thanks
nice video!
Do you use an arrow rest for this or just your hand/finger?
Composite bows were wood with horn on the back (resists compression) and sinew on the front (resists stretching) and a lot of wrapping and resin/glue.  So I wonder if you could laminate a strip of fiberglass cloth to the front edge using PVC cement instead of epoxy (but for the back I just dunno) and get moar pull?
can u make me a bow please I will pay you 20 for it maybe 30
this cool love try one you make test in the Field.
The long bow would maintain a high penetration over a longer distance than the re curve.
Hey,that was a gr8 work of urs.... I tried doing that but facing a problem.... I am from India nd u might know that we don't use any drive way markers here... so Is there any alternative away r an alternate material I can try using.... Plz do help
The penetration of the arrow is related to the distance you shoot. The arrow will start moving with a forward movement but also with a oscillation mouvement on the axis of the length of the arrow (due to compression forces of the pushing of the string). The oscillation subdues after a while (in miliseconds). When the oscillation disappears the arrow is at the peack of penetration capacity. Which means that an arrow needs some distance (40 feet should do) to reach its maximum penetration capacity. If you shooted the box from a longer distance your 70 pounds bow certainly  would have generated more penetration.
make that bow that's awesome!!
Love  the part where you tell your buddy where your stash is and give him a light !!!!!
yo I want to buy it
Did you make the arrows
A recurve has the same draw weight over nearly the full draw, instead of the drasticly increasing draw weight of an longbow. Therefore the distance and time the bow has to accelerate the arrow ist much longer and the energy (given the same weight) put into the arrow is higher. adding that the bow itself is often way lighter the acceleration of the throwarms is way quicker and needs lesser power. Lastly the handshock is much weaker with a recurve but more vibrating.  Your arrow test is good for a basic Idea, but with the stronger bows, the arrow hits fairly sideways, wich reduces the impact depth. You would need to have an arrow with fitting spine for every draw weight (archers paradox). Moreover, the stronger bows wont throw much faster than the weak ones, but be able to keep a similar throwing speed with way heavier arrows, so that the arrow has more kinetic energy.
Lower brace height = more power.  Oxymoron: "almost exxactly".  Subscribed, thanks, Arrowspeak
Where did you get your supplies
great video, and very intelligent if I might ad
You stated you couldn't pull the 75 lb. bow back all the way, probably one of the reasons you didn't get much penetration. Also, a recurve bow should fire the arrow faster than a longbow of the same draw weight, thereby giving the arrow more force when it hits the target. If you're only pulling 50-60 lbs. of the longbow's potential weight I would not be surprised that the recurve had better penetration.
did he sharpen the ends of the arrows
what else can you use instead of i rat tale file
My wife uses that ringtone...
I made it and mine is hanging right haha.
fiber glass
It's probably because you're not drawing back the more powerful bow as far, giving the force less time to act upon the projectile.
Excellent video.  You get right to the point and don't waste time.
a recurve bow has more power because of the "re curve" in the bow limbs that launch it forward by straightening the riser aswell as the extra bend from the curved limbs
yor arrow is not made for that wheight so your arrow waves in the air giving it less penetration
cool video
do you do archery as a hobby/sport?
Nice video. At 1:00, this gap you made, how strong it is? I'm concerned about it breaking while in use... Also, what are the specs of the rods you used? the thicker I could find is 2.2 mm x 200 cm
the amount of power contributed by the draw length increases exponentially the farther back you go. So if you are leaving like an inch in draw length on the 75lb bow you are leaving ALOT of extra power behind. Also, the recurve increases the draw length of the bow, so 2 bows of equal length, one recurve and one not will have different draw lengths and a disparity in power, with the recurve bow having the longer draw and greater power. The total weight of the bow, and in particular the weight at the tips of the bow will also affect power. So if you can find a way to shave mass off of the tips of a bow you can increase its strength as it will lose less energy just pushing the limbs forward on release, and send more power into the arrow itself.
the recurve bow has less draw with more power due to the fact that it's power comes at when it gets closer to its original position unlike other bows that's why you see elves using them in fantasy movies
I'm not trying to hate, I'm actually a HUGE fan of ZNA. Its just that I was watching zombiegoboom and they said a PVC bow and arrow isn't powerful enough for killing zombies or killing in general (if you're in to that stuff, like hunting) I recommend going to your local big5 and just buying yourself a bow and arrow. They are like 20 something dollars and they're really powerful.
For the recurve bow it's the curve that makes it how hard bow shoots
Hi, thank for the information on making bows, i' be glad if you can help with making home made fishing arrows.  Regards Chris - India
I love these videos
where would you get the material
What was that thing you used to shoot the arrow and gra it with.
could you hunt small game with it?
What are the materials again? Thank you!!
awesome
You should make a Yumi bow. :)
recurve bow has more power because the curve stops the string so the arow can go farther
Can anyone put the size of the material needed in metric system please?
recurve bow has a higher draw length to bow length ratio. in another word, with  the same draw length, recurve bow limbs are pulled back in a much larger angle than longbow limbs. when you release the arrow and the limbs bounce back, recurve bow certainly releases more energy as its limbs has to carry the arrow much further to reach its original position.
If you didn't draw the monster bow back as far as the recurve bow the reason is propably that the power stroke simply was shorter. If not the reason does lie in the design of the bow. As a rule recurves do have more power than longbows because they usually have more of their draw weight from the beginning on. Also due to the smaller length of this recurve less mass has to be moved, which means that more energy can be transfered to the arrow, so as a rule shorter bows are faster.
Let's talk about kevin...
Also the recurve makes the arrow fly faster but also straighter so that is why you are getting those results
dudes using all these bows with a quick release but no D loops. genius... -_-
just a small word of advice after making the notches for the string (with file) once you get string on the bow then put super glue on the string and notches. it will just insure that the string doesn't come out
Youre awesome great video!
could some 1 fill me in on some info and that is , i'm right handed so would i use my right hand to hold the bow and my left to pull or my left hand to hold and my right hand to pull as my right hand is stronger so i could pull back further , that's the thing that confuses me , but i take it i would still buy a right handed bow right ?
What's your workout ?
I want one
One way a recurved bow gets its mysterious powers is from the snappiness it gives the arrow just before it leaves the bow. A normal bow have the most power when you release the string. And then gradually loose power until it is back to its normal position where the arrow leaves the bow. You can understand this if you ever pulled a bow. It is easy to draw in the beginning (low energy) and then becomes harder to draw the longer you draw (more energy is stored in the bow). It means the arrow is accelerating the most in the beginning and then the force from the string is gradually going away as the arrow is leaving the string.   The recurved bow works the same. But, just when the string is back to its normal position and the energy is low, and the arrow is about to leave the string the recurve effect kicks in. The recurve shape on the bow makes the string straighten out really fast and hard end (in its normal position). That gives the arrow a hard kick just as it is about to leave the string. The arrow has already gain most of its momentum from the beginning and its mass is already moving forward. This extra kick is really helping to increase the speed of the arrow.   There is a lot more to learn about the recurve bow and its other benefits. But hope this was somewhat helpful =)
Hey Zna  I'm no bow expert but I know that a lighter string will increase the speed at which the bow can propel the arrow
Look up backyard bowyer for strengthening bow with flattening it guy uses hair dryer I think and leans on it - flattening it should make it stronger and watch videos on penobscot pvc bows as makes stronger again very simply I made my own penobscot pvc bow I started with pvc bow but the penobscot bow is amazing very strong-  it's like a reverse compound bow- someone on utube made a pvc bow adding wood and made it into compound bow incredibly stronger-  I love archery hope this helps u am enjoying your videos ty
just cut he driveway markers with hedge clippers
I kinda wanna do this now, but first of i have no idea where to find this stuff in germany and second of I have a very powerful (and not that cheap) bow, so...
hey zednought, i love your builds and, just as a quick thing, since i'm not sure if you have researched them or not but, due to the shape of the recurve it allows the bow to store more energy than a straight limbed bow, then there is the reflex which increases that again, with a reflex having the same power of a recurve at a 1:2 size ration and straight limbed at a 1:3 size ratio, the 1's being the recurve and straight limbed bows, also if you cable back the bow it can further increase the power, as well as reduce the tension on the bow itself making it possibly last longer, just a few things i thought you might like to know
Recurve bows aactually work the same as a compund
wow this is awesome and now i have one me own handmade bow and arrow.. thanks
from wikipedia: A recurve bow has tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. By definition, the difference between recurve and other bows is that the string touches a section of the limb when the bow is strung. A recurve bow stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow. A recurve will permit a shorter bow than the simple straight limb bow for a given arrow energy and this form was often preferred by archers in environments where long weapons could be cumbersome, such as in brush and forest terrain, or while on horseback. Recurved limbs also put greater strain on the materials used to make the bow, and they may make more noise with the shot. Extreme recurves make the bow unstable when being strung. An unstrung recurve bow can have a confusing shape and many Native American weapons, when separated from their original owners and cultures, were incorrectly strung backwards and destroyed when attempts were made to shoot them.[1] The unqualified phrase "recurve bow" or just "a recurve" in modern archery circles usually refers to a typical modern recurve bow, as used by archers in the Olympics and many other competitive events.
I just wonder if using a pair of fiberglas skis could make a good recurve bow :) you see i am Norwegian born with skis on http://www.klikk.no/helse/trening/tester/article878899.ece   narrow longdistance skis in to Takedown Recurve Bow style
What about arrows?
if i want to make shortbow version of this which lengths of fiberglass should i take? proportionate tho this?
plz make a recurve bow
Ugh I can't see how to make the knot
Just found out about your channel last night cuz i got bored an was like Hey! lets look up how to make a bow an boom came along  ZNA Productions lol ... Thanks for this! will totally have to make one now
How long should the fiberglass rods/ driveway markers be? Respond asap please it would be very helpful
The pully bow is actually called a compound bow
Fiberglass highway markers
I can't remember the exact math, but a recurve does create the same force as a higher weighted longbow.  If it was correct the first time I did it, for my particular recurve bow at 55# at 28" had the same force and speed of a 99# longbow at 28" with the same arrow.
great video dude. I literally just finished mine. got everything at Lowe's for $8. it took awhile and had to adjust it a few times but all in all it was easy. it shoots like a fucking boss too
great stuff from a young man !! MURICA !!
a better test of the speed would be to chronograph the arrow as each time it impacts the target in a different place and the target is being knocked aside so better to secure the target.
can u list down all the material used in this video
I painted mine like a tiger
Quick tip for the 'longbow' or non recurve version... make it a little taller than you are IF you can get fiberglass rods of suitable length.
I enjoyed your 'outtakes' at the end... subbed ;-D
Well, shit a brick! It works!
1:36 nice gloves man, which are these? My hands are getting rough..
what size are the drive way markers in width
Does he rest the arrow on his hand?
Thank you! Now I'm going to be a vigilante and save my city.
How thick are the driveway markers, I live in Australia and want to buy an alternative fibreglass rod and would like to know how big they are
How long are the fiberglass rods?
My 70lb compound bow will terminate that plastic
how do you make the arrows?
The powerful shot my friend said, stemmed not been tried in the ass...Nice Work mission completed
._.
Recurve bows actually are like small monster bows.  They curve two different ways to make the same length of a longer bow to a make compact version.  Due to this, it had more/ the same amount of length as a normal long bow.  This makes it have more power then it should have
So on short distances the recurved bow wins on penetration, but I guess the longbow shoots the arrow for longer distances than the recurved bow, right?
Can the one you just made kill a deer
Whenever I try to shoot the bow 50% of the way or more the paracord will come out of the pvc indent can someone please help me
Hi, im from Argentina and i wanted to know how big is the PVC pipe.  - what kind of rope you use? - Pvc pipe measures Of course thanks!
Can u pls make a cross bow??? :)
who cares jack the jakal
Calm down katniss everdean
This has probably been asked but, does anyone know where i can find fiberglass rods in the UK? I cant seem to find them anywhere.
i am trying to make this bow and shoot with out. But i dont know how long should the arrows be. Can anyone help plz?
amazing
you are AWSOME
how do i frickin find highway marker aka fiberglass rod in my country.... cant seem to find it in home depo
Eli, Do you need to use paracord? can you use other material? If so please can you give me a few ideas? thanks
I have those gloves
the cool thing is that he is prepared if the zombie apocalypse ever breaks out
Like I said before you would survive in a zombie apocalypse
would you ever sell one to me
Recurve bows let you fire arrows with a higher draw weight, without any extra strain
I'm not sure about the technical specifications of why recurve bows are more efficient, but I know they became as wide spread as they are because they produce the same efficiency as a longbow in a much more compact and easy to manage package , the downside is with that decreased size is a reduction in effective range.
The recurve bow is more efficient and durable (considering they were made out of different pieces of wood and ivory instead of a solid peace of wood that can easily bend in time for humidity).
Alpha is the MockingJay
God!? Is that you?
Anyone know how long the markers are
Sorry, explain what those fiberglass rods are ?  Where bought. I've never seen these anywhere.
you should join  the military...
Recurve bows are more effective at close quarters. Test them in long ranged targets. That's because the arrow shot from the heavier straight bow will take longer to dissipate momentum.
You'll find that increasing the draw weight of a bow without increasing arrow weight quickly proves to be futile.  Arrow speed is most affected by the speed at which the limbs recoil, so limb material and design are the two most important factors. Lightweight arrows provide little resistance so poundage doesn't make must difference in the long run. A good example of this would be hitting a ping-pong ball with the intended paddle, then hitting it with a hammer and seeing if the ball flies faster. The ball won't speed up any noticeable amount. The hammer definitely has more force behind it (due to the hammer's greater mass than the paddle), but the ping pong ball provides so little resistance the force is wasted. In order to make that ping pong ball go faster you'll have to hit it with something travelling even faster than the paddle or hammer. However, if you want to accelerate a more massive object, like a brick, you'll find hitting it with a hammer provides a huge improvement over hitting it with a paddle. The same applies to archery, a more massive longbow can lob very heavy arrows at moderate velocities, and those arrows will penetrate very deeply do to their increased momentum. For a longbow like yours in the video, (70lbs of draw) i would suggest an 800-1200 grain arrow. For the recurve bow, something in the 400-600 grain range would probably be best. I have a hybrid "reflex-deflex" longbow that's 50lbs of draw (it closely resembles your recurve bow in practice) and it shoots 570 grain arrows very nicely. I also have a 70lb warbow, and with 500 grain arrows it's unimpressive for the effort to shoot it, however, with 1100 grain arrows it will shoot through concrete cider blocks. It's all about the physics.   Also, the spine (that is, how much the arrow flexes around the riser of the bow) for the arrow you're shooting is completely off. A properly spined arrow will penetrate much deeper due to more efficient use of energy. So you might look into getting a test kit and figuring out the best arrow spine for your bow. You'll be glad that you did.
sure was. little brother that's taller. lol
This video is precisely why I am addicted to youtube. It's short, quick to the point and very informative. I love this stuff and I am inspired to make one of these. I like learning things from other people. If you just stick with the positive stuff youtube can be a very awesome leaning tool.
This was posted on my Birthday
Can anyone tell me the best diameter for the fibreglass rods? Thanks.
please make a video of how to shoot arrows straight
Just a hunch, sure someone may be able to provide some numbers but, your re-curve bow has lighter limbs and likely to move a lot faster then the 1 inch pvc with a core, which would give an arrow better penetration. Oh, and the arrow has a bit to do with it as well, if the arrow isn't weighted/stiff enough for the bow it will glance off at an angle (archers paradox) and become less effective.
excellent instructional. thanks for making it!
how did he keep the driveway markers in the pvc pipe ???
I just wondering what he has in his hand when shooting the arrow
dude ur so freake  buff
the reason why the high power longbow didn't penetrate like the recurve is cuz of the spine flex of the arrow
how many meters pvc need and amount rope????????
What kind of paracord do you use
You sir, are my hero. I am going to try to build this. Thank you.
Is your brother an arsonist?
Just finished some "Rise Of The Tomb Raider" game play and now I'm here.
i really wanna make one
can you pleace tell me the things that you use to make the bow, thank you
You're hella hot for some bow man. You're putting legolas to shame
nice one man what men yellon thin??? and put insede de pvc??
I believe the point of the recurve on that bow, and the reason it fires faster with a lower draw has to do with the points where the paracord is attached. That point is what I'm assuming is about 3 inches forward in relation to the cord's resting point because of the recurve, meaning those points (and the cord as well) have to travel a slightly longer distance than they normally would if the bow didn't have a recurve. And you know, Speed=distance/time, so by making the distance greater and keeping the time from the drawn state to the resting state the same, you're getting a faster arrow using a lower draw weight, just by increasing the distance the string needs to travel.  Or some shit. I'm not really a mathematician, just some nerd.
wouldn't the fiberglass rods slide out?
cant i just buy this off u
can i use something different than viber glass or how its called
just checked out all ur vid and i thought that basically come a zombie outbreak u would do just fine
Definitely looking forward to trying to make this. Awesome video by the way!
You should make a recurve cross bow
this vid was alot of help and the bow is great
Dear Mr. Nice done. Wha\S the diameter and length of the rods. Please write in cm/mm. Thank you.
Extreme weather changes? You must live in Oklahoma, haha. *singing* Oh, home on the plain, where the weather is never the same *singing*
dont stretch your arm out so far leave a bend in your arm u wont slap your rist with the string of your bow
wich is the name of that rods and the lace?
Thanks for dis awesome build im really happy with the result ^_^
What is the width of the driveway markers? I have many options to buy, from 1mm to 8mm
The penetration length also depends on how far away you stand from the target. You may have been a few cm-inches closer, so that's probably why it was the same as the recurve bow
Hi
If there is a Zombie Apocalypse, wanna be friends? Juuuuuuuust Sayin'
Hii i dont understand wat you need for the Bow.
Yo dude. Totally make a recurve bow. Would be legit.
I appreciate the fact that he admitted that there was something he didn't know and would research. A true scientific mind.
I made a similar bow, except I didn't use the highway markers. I wrapped a few layers of duct tape around an 8 inch wooden dowel that just almost fit inside the PVC before tape. I positioned it right in the middle of the PVC. It gave the bow plenty of backbone and prevents it from deforming the way you described. I make 25-30 yard shots with pretty good accuracy with it and have been shooting with it for nearly 3 years! I used that cheap paracord that you've got in this video, but later I went with real 550, which works way better and is far more durable. Also added a nocking point with another tiny piece of duct tape. I later made some sight marks on the bow for different yardages using thin strips of black duct tape that worked great. I dig your videos, little brother. Keep up the great work!!
Zed where can i buy these markers? every hardware store thinks i need to be in construction detail just to get these lol?
*mechanical advantage* like some guy with a rat bike beats some other guy with a kawasaki or something in take off and acceleration.
inexpensive arrow ideas for fletching. cylinder bases thirty six inches in length and range from diameters at hobby lobby for 59 cents a piece. one could cut a nock at the end pick up some feathers whilst at hobby lobby or some other type of material that may be inexpensive and one could order glue on metal tips in a multi pack for not as expensive than five dollars an arrow or more by getting name brands. maybe some pvc or wood glue to attach the point.
Very cool video homey.  Thank you.
Can you use a dremal instead of a rat tail file
How do the arrows fit to the para cord? don't they slip of the rope after cocking the bow? how does that work with the arrows?
We're do you get the yellow things I can't find them
Could this kill a deer?
what about the bigger pulley bow you made? or do u not have that anymore
how much does 3 fiberglass bars cost?
This is a surprisingly good video and he does a great job of giving a fair comparison of the bows. ( not a bad shot either ) keep up the good work
recurve has a greater spring and the Long bows require a heavier arrow to be effective.  I have lots of expierience from hunting with these if you want to know my source
could I cut a notch with the file in the middle of the bow for the arrow to sit in?
cool
this my bow  did not use hi way markers but it's cool
Please make a video like this, but for the monster bow
How in the hell do i tie that loop?????
is 35 lbs good when hunting birds
Great video. seems you've found your inner archer. cheers
Hi ZNA, my name is lucca (13). I made one of your bow and I spent about 5 Brazillian Real= 2$ and I just think I did a great job at it. It is a double pvc tube measuring 5cm X 1m. I made the arrows out of bamboo with no feathers and they were actually really great and very accurate with no turning. I tested it out on a mango tree and about 2 inches went inside. Now imagine a human!!! But as you said before, (18+) I know, I know. Me and my cousins were extremely careful and made many rules on when to shoot. We shot at my grandmas huge back yard surrounded by walls. But there was one thing that was really amazing. Some of the arrows that we shot went into the thick wall. Next vid maybe try yours out on a wall for me to compare how good I did next to a PRO!!!
I am totally doing one. Which kind of string should I use? Nylon would work?
many reasons and factors....10,000 years of trial and error to make best bow out of materials available in your habitat..... read...study bowyers bible series 1-4....all your Questions will be answered.
The recurve was perfected by the Mongol's because of it's power and compact size for use on horseback.  It would shoot farther and with more power than the traditional bows of their enemies. Much more power comes from the recurve section being forced to bend back on itself giving more power to the traditional part of the bow.
I bet the reason the arrow was about the same in penetration with your strongest pull back bow and the 40lb bow was because the arrow was too light for the bow.
Driveway marker size?
wat is the name of the string u used??
this is sick
thanks for showing me how to make this. my dad thought i had no clue what i was doing untill i shot the arrow out of site. this is the first build of yours I've done and im trying to convince my dad to get me an angle grinder so i can do more of your builds. I've been stalking your chanel since you made that mase. love your channel keep building your friend - josh
Your a boss👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😄😄😄
i really love it when you discovery something like the recurve bow getting the same penetration as the monster bow i was wondering if you would do more in depth videos about certain bows and also make more bow videos they are very interesting weapons i think people would enjoy it more than you think and who knows you may discovery a new design of bow
Ok... if the rope is hitting my hand (between my wrist and my thumb), what should i do? Put less rope or more rope? It's being pulled so strongly that the rope almost hits the PVC when i release it, but when i'm with my hand holding the bow, it hits my hand
About the Recurve Bow, You are absolutely right about them being more efficient shooters than a straight long bow.    Due to the reflex (recurve) at the ends of either limb it causes them (the limbs) to store more energy and thus shoot  faster and harder, this is because the string literally rolls around the ends of the limbs as it's coming to rest.  The recurves also sort of act like levers making the bow easier to bring to full draw   Anyhow, pardon my rambling enjoy life and shoot straight ^_^  P.S. While you're at it you should check out the PVC Archery and Crafting community on Google+ https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/115443350092709812365and pick Lonnie Lister's brain about Fiberglass reinforced bows, he knows his stuff and he's usually more than happy to share the knowledge as are the rest if the active members of the group   Anyhow, rambling again  Take care ^_^
I just like the recurve bow from your subscriber  I would seriously own one like that
please write the names of all the things that you can use in the bow
please write the names of all the things you cn uz in bow
While there is a direct correlation between draw weight and impact pressure a heavier draw does not necessarily mean more ft lbs of force go into the target. A heavier draw with a lighter arrow will move faster and have more effective range but it won't hit with as much force as a heavy arrow.
"And just remember, you're not arm-wrestling this thing." *dead*
ARGHH!! BAN ASSAULT BOWS! MADE IN GARAGES MUST NEED REGISTERING AAHH!  I wonder when Obama will start wanting bow-control.
love it but...y u has no vice?
Can this kill a deer?
You should do a give away one of your bows. Where did you get the highway markers?
Great video
Hey, bro! I love your videos, I have to say you're good building stuff, keep it up.  ...so, after watching some of your vids I searched my attic for a Bow I was sure I've seen and found it!!! The only thing is that it doesnt have a string. Could you recommend me some string materials and how much tension I have to apply to it? Thanx, man. Greetimga from Mx!
would this be good for hunting ?
your brother looks like the kid in Ito the storm
Hey dude i just made this and i cant even draw the damn thing halfway back thanks for what you do and keep it up
Are you just good at everything you try, those archery hits looked pretty legit.
just made this shit it works better than what i thought it would.
What are the fibre-glass rods. just checked ebay and only found fishing rods.
Could a 12 year old pull and fire this?
Your heavy bow has a much larger moment of inertia (swing weight) than the recurve bow. It has a heavier end, it is longer. (the weight of the end of a long limb has a much larger effect on swing weight). A lot of the energy stored in bending the bow is used to move the arms as opposed to the arrow. Additionally, a recurve bow in general has a number of benefits.  Recurve bows work by unbending each limb of the bow rather than by bending the whole bow more. Because of this, the force of the bow string on the limb is more forwards and backwards rather than up and down. This means that the limbs actually move less in order to provide the same draw as a long bow.   Because of this, when the string is released, less power is used to return the limbs to their start position than with a longbow. Additionally, I'm not certain, but I think a recurve bow might have a smoother power curve (ie the draw weight at different lengths does not change as much) This would mean that the string's push on the arrow does not decrease as much as it approaches its minimum position. Then again, you would have to measure the difference in draw weight for a very short draw in addition to a long draw.
What size was the paracord?
Does it matter how thick the cord is?
Your assumption about the recurve bow is pretty much correct. The curvature acts as an additional spring upon release, increasing the actual arrow velocity with a lower draw weight
for all you morons asking where to get the markers   The Home Depot $1.99 each
Is there any alternative to fibreglass markers? they're not common in india and damn expensive
Awesome bow Nice arms mate ;)
What's the thickness/length of the fiberglass rods?
great video ! Keep up the good work bro.
You called it! Recurve is designed that way! It gave the Mongols and tartars the extra edge on the battlefield. Plus it is said Mongol bows reached upwards of 160lb draw weight. On top of that, look up how they drew back their bow, their technique. They used a special ring made of horn that went on their thumb. Imagine doing a one-handed pull up over and over again, then imagine doing it with just your thumb..... Then imagine doing it standing in stirrups on horseback, full gallop, shooting backwards  because your enemies weren't armored as much from behind. That's bad ass.
Hey ZednoughtAlpha thanks for making this video because I like weapons especially Bows and Arrows!
Draw weight is draw weight when it comes to the physics of launching an arrow. The point of a recurve bow is that your able to get a higher draw weight in a more compact bow. Idk if the mongols invented the recurve but as far as I understand they were one of the first to use it, and the reason they favored it over a long bow is they were able to use it more effectively from horse back, which is how they preferred to fight. Most other people of the time used a long bow because they were easier to make and they either used them for hunting or a somewhat fixed position, so they didn't care to go through the extra processes to make them. I believe the reason your heavier long bow isnt getting as good of performance is due to your light arrow, generally lighter arrows have weaker splines. Basically the bow is over powering the arrow and the arrow is loosing energy due the flex. Do a quick youtube search on "Archers Paradox", there are some really good videos that explain it at depth.    Even a compound bow is only capable of shooting an arrow as fast as any other bow of the same weight, the reason compound bows are the most prevalent is that you are able to aim and stabilize a bow with a much higher draw weight due to the let off (there is also a bunch of fancy things you can do to tune them, and they're all "tacticool" looking so people buy them just cause). Hope that saves you some research, very good video.
Is there an alternative to the driveway markers? I'm having a hard time looking for a place that sells them here in the Philippines.
hello I don't have that heat thing to heat the pvc, will a hair dryer work and if so can u tell me how long i need to hold it on until its ready to bend or whatever
Can this kill a deer
pfft 90 degres
A recurve accelerates the arrow more in the last bit of travel like a compound bow.
do the fiber glass rods stay in place on there own or can you put something om it to make it stay in place
awesome vid bro, also great muscle tone and shoulder definition, your stance is pretty good, just watch that left elbow, starting to bend back a bit, its not a problem now, but if you advance to heavy bows you need to rely on muscle tension over joint locking, seen some nasty injuries from arms over extending- there's a few techniques to minimize tennis elbow as well- i only mention all this because it looks like you could really go far in the sport
i like the out takes at the end keep adding those. but don't fake them.
The recurve make the arrow keep accellerating even close to the bow where the string tension is at its lowest. A compound bow is harder to draw in the begining and easier to hold aming. That makes the arrow accellerating all the way.
Please try making a collapsible baton with a built in stun gun
I made one of these today after watching this, it works pretty good, im just not very good at aiming with it, it likes to shoot the arrow to the right, im assuming its because the arrow is offset on the bow, ill just have to keep practicing lol
great vid !
It does add power reduces size and gains effecentceyy
Sick
tubol
A long now was meant to shoot long distances as the arrow drops in its arc it builds up speed. As for the recurve bow it was meant to be shot at medium distance but at insane speed and accuracy. So you have about the same penetration because the bows are meant to be used differently that's all. ( this is just what I believe don't know if it is accurate or not )
Subscribed lol Good work my man.
I made a 1" diameter pvc longbow with no fiberglass, but I don't have any arrows that will fit the string. I used a narrow nylon string and fired it with a tomato stick maybe 15 feet.  I was going for a light as possible bow, to introduce people to archery/larp, but I am worried it might hurt someone, even with foam arrows.   Warning to all of ya, Keep baking powder on hand for smothering burning nylon or paracord.
Don't quote me on this, but I believe the point of re-curve bows is to make the draw as consistent as possible. For example, a short bow's draw weight increases dramatically the further you draw it, but a re-curve would be the same weight, no matter how far you draw.
Recurves make the string go back to the starting point faster due to the natural curve being far past where the bow is strung.
when using a recervered bow don't swing ur right hand backwards
get a chronograph and check your speeds, run your speeds against the weight of your arrows to get the energy (flbs).
hi, whats the diameter of the fibreglass rods?
Wow, I must make this bow someday!
use a mask if u work with fiber glass
Recurve bows are generally more efficient cause of its design and will give the arrow more power without the need for more weight.
I don't know what that bit toward the end was with the visitor at the door, but it was actually really funny, so thanks for leaving it in.
I once bult a compound long-bow out of PVC. My did almost shoot a woman butt while the testing; and he never tried to shoot again.
The recurve bow should have more power output for the same force at the draw, because of the force along the travel of the arrow. People tend to think the force required to keep the bow drawn is the force put into the arrow, but the bow is adding force all along the travel. You'll notice on your straight bows that the force required to keep pulling gets significantly harder as you go back. You have to add the force all along that path of travel to get the actual work put into the arrow. A lot of force applied when you first release, but very little is applied when the bow has almost reverted to its preferred shape.. The reason why your stopping point on the monster bow isn't earlier is precisely because of this increase in force required as the bow deforms.  So a normal bow needs an increase in force based on how far inward the ends are curving. The more perpendicular they are to the draw, the easier it is to pull. So to get more energy at the beginning of the pull that will multiply on top of your end draw strength, you need the curve inward of the ends to be closer to the curve inwards of the end when you have fully drawn the bow. The recurve accomplishes this quite well, since the end of where it is pulling has rotated around the tip.. It is also the same reason why a long bow has more power for the same draw length, because the extra length makes the ends curve less inward.
the design of the recurred bow allows the bows curves to be used to there full potential
when i looked at the two high power bows penetration, my immediate reaction was to blame it on arrows. you have a small bulge in the arrows tip, giving it a small penetrating head, but it avoids penetration (this is because it's not designed to penetrate into an animal but a wooden/rope/practice target), once you put enough force in to the arrow that thing ends up working pretty much the same way as non-Newtonian fluids. the more it has power the faster it will stop.  i.e. try the same thing with a broad head. if the heavier bow still doesn't penetrate, there's something else going on.
It's about speed of the limbs. A really heavy draw weight bow can shoot heavier arrows at same speed as a lighter draw weight bow shoots lighter arrows If their limbs are in proportion. The poundage is a bit like torque in cars.   To get more speed you should try to make the limbs lighter at the ends. I used wooden ends on my bows limbs (siyahs) and it's awesome how much more speed you can get. +180 fps or 55 m/s  It's also fun to experiment with different designs and see how they perform.  And PVC alone can give you easily over 150# as i managed to make a PVC prod for a crossbow at around 180#. It performed poorly in terms of speed though. only 35-40 m/s or 115-135 fps  This is just my take, please feel free to correct if I'm wrong!
hell yeah i would love to make a bow like that!
Wow. Now I know what to make for the zombie apocalypse. That seriously, that is very cool.
or you just buy a cheap bow on e-bay for about 25 $
You should find the specifications and just for shits and giggles, build an English Longbow. The draw weight on those bad boys was from 100 to 180 pounds (yes REALLY, Google it non believers!!) As to how the hell would one be able to pull that back, well the Longbowmen trained all their life just for that weapon, sometimes having absolutely no proficiency with any other weapon. Found this in Wikipedia: "the Englishman did not keep his left hand steady, and draw his bow with his right; but keeping his right at rest upon the nerve, he pressed the whole weight of his body into the horns of his bow. Hence probably arose the phrase "bending the bow," and the French of "drawing" one.".I guess with enough training you can get those back, shoulder and arm muscles to that level. The whole point of the Longbow was EXTREME range and power strong enough to penetrate steel plate armor when a volley of hundreds was fired from a higher vantage point... Also, I am looking to get into archery, absolutely LOVE IT, but i'm not much of a crafty guy, can you recommend any brand/style of bow for a begginer? Thanx!!
how did you make your targets?
Good thing he called before just strolling in. "Hey whats goin-"  FHAWP  "AHHHH MY KNEE!!!"
when you were fireing the bows, you didnt use youre bare hands. you had some kind of plastick handle to draw it back. what was that and is it nessecery?
What kind of knot do you tie?
can u send me one
If the zombie apocalypse ever happens, I'll know how to make a handy silent weapon. Thanks! lol
45 lbs is the legal bow weight in my state. You could legally hunt deer with it here.
Does the FIBERGLASS need be exactly tight fitting the pvc inside?
Recurve bows are able to store more power because of the curved limbs
can someone translate the measurements into metric ones?
Excellent video. Great music. Excellent production and editing.
definitely ant to know how to make that recurve!
I CLIKED ON THIS COS OF THOSE ARM MUSCLES IN THE TAB REREREREEEREREREEEEEE
why make a bow from scratch. when making gun from scratch is much easier.  a metal pipe, a meda pipe cap, a fuse,some cloth, some black powder(or hair spray), and any hard object for projectiles. drill a hole for the fuse towards the back fill with black powder then insert cloth wad then insert projectiles. point in the generral direction of the target light fuse boom dinner.
Umm great video, but saw the exact same thing on doomsday preppers. To be fair though, they didn't explain how they made it as good
great video pal :)
Dude badass video. One of the best ways to  utilize PVC piping
If you wrap the area you are going to cut with tape (on the fiberglass rod) then the splinters won't go everywhere.
Love the bow. followed your lead and couldn't be happier. Do you recommend unstringing the bow between every use or does it matter that much?
I think recurve bow add slightly more energy in the arrow because the curved part draws the cord up, and forward a bit while launching. Maybe it works a bit as pulley one.
?can i replace the driveway markers with something else
How do the fiberglass rods stay inside the pvc?
is there an alternative to the fiber glass rods
Wow '-' didn't expect that impact
Loving ur vids and laughed my ass of because of your brother ^^ plis never staph doing these awesome vids <3
To think that some medieval bows were 120-160 draw weight :| at least that is what has been found that i have seen/researched.
Yes, its speed.. you need the best balance between speed and power. you can have 45p bows give you better results than 70p bows :)
Did you seriously just use BOWFLEX technology to make a bow flex??? Awesome idea btw
Peace and greetings to you sir! This is a very interesting video! Thanks for the information!  Do you work out with weights to be able to use bows with greater power? Or do just keep practicing with bows that have increasing levels of pill weight?  I also wanted to say, as a Physician Assistant,  I really appreciate the fact that you seemed to have taken good measure to ensure your safety and that of those around you whilst making and testing the bows. I subscribed to your channel.  Could you please subscribe to mine? Maybe we can do a collaborative video on bow - related injuries or exercises. Peace, Omar " Dr.O the PA Pro " Abdul-Malik DHEd, MPAS, PA-C, CHES
Where did u find the fibreglass rods?
Speed of the arrow is proportional to the energy (work) put into bending the bow during the pull. The work is the sum of the products of draw weight x pull distance for each increment of pull (if you've had integral calculus, it's the integral of draw force as a function of draw distance, from zero to full draw). Best guess is that though the recurve does not reach the same maximum weight at full bend, if you graphed its draw weight vs draw distance you would see a steeper climb at the beginning of pull--it will get hard to pull after fewer inches, but then level off flatter. This means you are putting more total energy into the draw with the recurve--without having to hold the higher weight of the monster at max pull--and therefore the arrow travels faster with less perceived draw effort.  Sort of a low tech precursor to the let-off on modern compound bows, which is achieved with variable-radius cams. Pretty neat.
You should do a video on making cross bows :)
yea, the recurve bow is a way of giving the same amount of force with less draw weight. It's the ends where they curve that gives it that effect
im making one when i get a new job
a 75lb draw weight was generally the minimum needed to penetrate something like Gambeson at long distance. English longbows would have something like a 135lb draw weight  which takes shitloads of practice to be able to pull. I've practiced for years and i can just about get 110lb.
AWESOME ! that PVC bow you made with the fiber glass road markers rocked with speed , power and accuracy, however I would love to make a re-curved was that fiberglass as well?
The recurves on the tips of the bow basically act as wrenches and allow you to store more energy in the bow while using less effort. It's all about the angle of the string to the limb of the bow.  If the angle is large, the string has less leverage and so the rate of draw weight increases greatly. If the angle is very acute, the string has more leverage, so it's easier to draw. This effectively increases the draw weight of a well made recurve bow, such that if it scales at lets say 45 lbs, it could equate to the shooting force of a 60+ lbs draw weight bow with straight limbs.
With the "monster" bow you should shorten the string. With bows it is usually the "rule of thumb" with the string and bow length, meaning you should be able to put a thumbs up between the string and the belly of the bow
what is in your hand when you shoot the bow
can u use wood instead of fiber glass
Im gonna make one and get ready for h1z1 battle royale, jk.Good vid man.I just stumbled across this video and im glad i did.Hope to see more.
The recurve works by opposing the direction of the string when you let go, during the last moments it would otherwise still hold the arrow. It stops the string before it can make a straight line of itself creating a snappier release and also dampens the vibration to the limbs.
subscribing because it really is interesting how each bow works and I want to see how to make the recurve.
Cool demonstration. Thank you for sharing
the high weight of the "monster bow" will slow down the acceleration of the arrow because of mass. Power of the bow comes from light weight and draw power and I believe it also has to do with how fast the bow material finds its original shape.
"Sorry if this is boring to you"  (6:19) - What!? Dude, I'm pretty sure if somebody is here not by a mistake, this must be bloody interesting in fact. It's the 1st video of your channel I see and I'm very sure, that I'm going to watch whole your channel today at night, and I love to see how you take the things you speak about. Awesome job you are doing with your videos!
What is the lengthnof the fiberglass highway markers
this is brilliant Oo
Wat type of arrows do you use
I don't understand why people use the clip tab thing to shoot, could someone explain it to me?? I've always shot with my fingers always been more natural and relaxing for me.
great vid dude
i know this used no power tools but if you have a dremell tool it is much faster than the file
I want to learn how to make the recurve bow.
go to backyardbowyer on youtube. he has all your pvc bow needs
I actually did this all the time as a kid, I had a different method of putting the fiberglass markers together tho. I wish I had figured out to do it this way.
use a file to cut fiberglass for less splinters and less breakage
Unexpectes weather is nothing new in Aus. Goddamn desert never has any consistency
Recurve is more efficient.  Your longbow issue is because you are not getting enough draw.
Btw the song in the background is lensko - Cetus
in a book i read it explained that a recurve  bow is shorter and flexes in three places,in the middle and at both ends versus the long bow which basically is a single long spring. in doing this a recurve even at a lower pull, releases with more snap and shoots the arrow at a faster speed, thus allowing it to equal a longbow with a very high draw power.
I really enjoyed the way you edited in the developments and discoveries. It made the video much more interesting, and I instantly want to see more on the recurve. The bit at the end was funny too. You've pulled off a very authentic and personable feel. Keep up the awesome work!
The recurve bow is shorter so it can be used on horseback, It can be shorter and output the same amount of power because of the actual shape of the bow, This is from what I know but im not a 100% sure
awesome vid, instant sub
My understanding about recurve bows its like an AK47 with a folding stock, same power smaller size :)
#katniss_everdeen
stick with the 45# recurve
HEY HOW ABOUT THE ARROW??
one way to think of the recurve bow is that aside from the badass look, it has a much smoother release so to speak. When you let go of the arrow, the 2 mini bows on the ends are absorbing the shock from the release and keeping that from slowing down the main power of the middle section of the bow.  your big bow, because it is so heavy and not properly narrowed on both ends (doesn't not get smaller as you reach the edges) like a normal long bow, the shock of the release due to the draw power is, almost for a slit second, halting the shot. but that's enough to make the difference. If you used a slightly heavier arrow or maid the ends lighter than the main body, you would remove or at least lessen this problem, depending on how good a job you do.    A good way to picture this is by imagining a heavy elastic pole of equal width from side to side. bend it far back and release. Because your ends are just as heavy, and in total heavier than your middle they are literally wobbling back and forth, (a slow mo video makes it very easy to see). this wobble is absorbing your kinetic energy, and if it was strong enough with a weak enough material, your bow would shatter.   Hope this helps.
how about an arrow? Is their a way to make arrows for this?
Where are you from I'm from the Midwest and our weather is like that
Are you using a release
is there any alternative to the road marker?
where do I buy the markers?
become a quincy :v
This is pretty damn interesting. Gonna make one myself
I'd realy like to see your vid about making that curved bow
Oh and new subscriber :)
Fantastic video and I love your interest. Only critique of your video is your heavy use of jump-edits. Other than that, this made me want to make a bow. Home Depot here I come :)
haha weird, im wearing the same exact shirt as you. awesome video tho!!! im doing this
I finished this bow tonight and it shoots really well, I am really excited to make a target to shoot. Would you make a tutorial for a wrist guard? I didn't think I would need one but after a while of shooting it starts to hurts a bit
Get someone stronger to pull the monster bow, see if they get the arrow deeper than you can with the subscriber bow.
Recurves do indeed shoot faster than non-recurves of the same draw weight (and many above their draw weight). You already have significant tension on the bow before you pull it back, where a flatbow, longbow or other non-recurve bow has far less tension when strung.  It's just better tech.
hey man really cool video!
just made mine WORKS LIKE A BEAST
what king of string did you use?
Recurve bows give you more power for a lesser draw weight
How thick and long are the fibreglass rods?
How long should the pvc tube be
Did you also carve a notch in where the arrow sits?
make the recurve bow
effectiveness with lower power has been seen in some comparison with a lot of things
You ever thought about investing in a go-pro? (Or other head-mounted camera's)
What length are those driveway markers and what diametre.
I just finished this build and it worked a charm. I did have a question about your fiberglass though. How thick are those rods? I used 3/8 in fiberglass in sched 40 3/4 in PVC, and couldn't get them to fit in that arrangement, so had to rearrange what I had and put them in as a triangle, which was still so tight that the tape wouldn't fit. I had to use contact cement to keep them together. I had difficulty stringing it with the string length recommended, so I modified it. I tested the draw using a luggage scale, and it came out at ~55 lbs.   Long story short, I would assume that this means your rods are 1/4 in?
A recurve bow stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow. A recurve will permit a shorter bow than the simple straight limb bow for a given arrow energy and this form was often preferred by archers in environments where long weapons could be cumbersome, such as in brush and forest terrain, or while on horseback.
geez, sun's out guns out indeed
I would love to see how the recurve bow is made! I am very curious
just made one of these bows gotta make some arrows then ill get to test fire
Make the curved one
The recurve lets it bend in 3 places normal point and the ends
Shopping list, since there wasn't one copy-pastable: -Duct tape -para-cord -5ft 3/4 inch schedule 40 PVC -Fiberglass Driveway markers
Carb you put all the things we need in the discretion like the type of pvc and type of cord and etc
Hey Eli, the point of the recurve is so when you draw it back it will straighten out and spring forward launching the arrow faster
If no one's mentioned it yet: Yes, a recurve bow stores and delivers energy more efficiently, allowing a smaller overall bow to have more punch. But I think it's louder and there's risk of damage when stringing it. I imagine you could make one out of PVC if you bend the pipe (instructions easily found on google), although I don't know if simple bending the ends would make it a recurve bow.
The curve on a Recurve bow creates a whip effect which increases arrow speed :)
Can someone tell me where I'd buy highway markers?
that is why the native Americans used recurve bows
what's the thing on his hand that helps with the arrow?
Nox hi zoh. Ruzun zu'u los ni dovah, zu'u fen praag wah unt wah meyz med dovahkiin ahrk kos vos wah ronah ronaaz rinik gut. hi lost hiif zey ko daar ful zu'u fen med daar bodilir!
Those are nice.  A word of caution Too light an arrow(spine/stiffness) in too heavy a bow can cause the arrow to collapse and fold in two as you release it.  It also effects arrow launch and flight, so you want an arrow spine matched to the bow for consistent launch.  In the video where you launched the arrow past the camera, that it apears your knock point on the string in relation to where you are holding the bow and your finger as the arrow rest is a little off.  This causes the arrow to fly tail high or low.  A good way to gauge this is to make a wooden frame and tape a sheet of butcher paper or newspaper to it and put it a few feet in front of your target.  Shoot an arrow thru it and observe the pattern it tears in the paper.  Ideally it will be a center hole and 3 little tears from the fletching indicating a stable flying arrow. tail left or right is probably arrow spine mismatch, tail up or down is nock point/arrow rest position...  Good work!
damn you must live in Oregon / Washington to get that type of weather change
please make the recurve bow
Cool video, first time viewer and will definitely be coming back for more as well as checking out older ones.  Also I thought that the reason that the recurve may have had more penetration than the 70 lb longbow even though it was a lower lb strength might be that the 70 lb has a greater draw length and you may have not been pulling it back fully and therefore were not able to access it's full strength where as with the recurve you had no problem and therefore were able to unleash its full strength.  Just a theory also now I plan on making some of these bows on my own time for friends, family, and myself.  Oh and I know that you didn't make the recurve but it would be cool if you did a video on how to make one if possible.  Have an awesome day.
The curves at the end of a recurve bow, are so it builds more power to the body instead of the bowstring.
I once drew back a 70 lb compound bow...I don't even know how
Please make a ballistic knife
Are you in Oregon because that is one of the only places I know where the whether can change like that.
You gotta know that recurve bows are more efficient at shorter ranges.
Hi  So the reason why your recurve bow penetrates just as deep as your fibreglass bow is the energy stored/draw length graph.  The recurve shape is awesome since there is a more linear increase in this graph and stores the energy more linearly per unit of draw length of the bow.  Whereas the fibreglass bow "stacks" aka stores alot of energy in the beginning few units of draw length as compared to when you keep pulling on that bow and consequently stores less energy as you keep drawing for the later units of draw length. ( the graph is steep then levels off quickly)
Recurves are more efficient than straitbows, I believe both pound for pound and definately per inch length.
What are you using as a shelf to shoot off of
A normal bow loses force towards the end of it's stroke. A recurve bow is still pushing the arrow at the end of its stroke.
90 then rain then sun again. Must be Florida! I am in no way an archer, but this is seriously cool and makes me want to make a few. Maybe something smaller for my girls. Very interested in the recurve  model. Thanks for the video!
thanks
from my experience the recurves extra bends gives the bow a greater pre load. a greater preload means that your max draw weight is reached much earlier in the draw. so when you release the string it has its maximum potentiometer almost the full length of travel all the way back to its resting position. where as a long bow style bow with no curves to create such a pre load you start to loose alot of potential energy before the sting ever travels it's full length of the draw. therefor the arrow looses punch if you will before it ever leaves the string. this is also why you will notice a shorter bow seeming to fire an arrow faster. this is just from my experience. first video of yours that I've watched. keep it up.

Meh.. i cant get half of that stuff in my country. not even from amazon. i can find it on amazon (dot) com tho. also if someone could put a list of ingrediences down form me i'd be Super Happy :D
could you include cm textboxes for the non american people?
Awesome info here on bows, and your blooper reel was hilarious!
+ZednoughtAlpha did u made your arrows or did u just bought it?
did u made your arrows or did u just bought it? anyone ho knows that i would appreciate an answer ;D
Almost exactly?
WICKED AWESOME!!!! I'm gonna make this for sure!!!
Facepalm your friend x3
The recurve in the bow makes the bow dnap forward a lot faster causing it to go much faster.
What string did he use?
I made one of the fiberglass bows using back yard bowyers instructions and it draws 45lb at 28" .  As to the 70lb bow not being able to get a full draw is probably getting you a 55 lb cast but the real reason for not going deeper is the energy the arrow carries into the target and what the target absorbs.  You can shoot a heavier arrow with the bigger bow and you will get more penetration.
The recurve has a different draw force curve than the long bow.  If you were to graph the poundage on one side and the distance you draw the bow on the other, you would see that you have more energy being transferred to the arrow with the recurve because it holds the lighter draw weight longer than the long bow.  A standard hunting compound bow has a draw force curve  shaped like a upside down J so the peak weight is in the middle over a short distance then drops off at full draw.   Where the compound picks up so much more energy is it starts with low weight at the release of the arrow and builds speed before hitting peak weight causing the arrow to have forward momentum before it hits peak weight.  Simply put the recurve pushes the arrow longer with more weight even tho peak weight is less than your monster bow.
now i really want to know how to make the recurve one
Legal hunting weight =35lbs
that is very interesting
Yeah with the recurve you can get a lot powerful shot with a less powerful bow
VERY NICE!!!!
The recurve get their power from their bend. The bend causes the string of the bow to return to its starting position faster than a normal longbow design making the arrow fly faster.
Recurve bow has 2 points where it bends, so it gives more power to arrow, and its lighter to pull back. But longbow has only one point where it bends so no double power to arrow.
does anybody know Illinois has bipolar weather how do I know cuz I live here
Good video! There are four things in my mind about the same performance of the two different bows. First is the draw length, if you can draw 40 pounds, but you can draw one bow further back with that force than the other the one with the longer draw will be stronger/faster. The reason is because it can accelerate the arrow in a longer distance. Second is simply the string, stiffer the string mean faster arrow (but too stiff string can damage the bow) Third is the actual weight of the bow (limbs), because the stored energy is accelerate you arrow but the same energie accelerate the limbs as the arrow as well so lighter bow with same drawweight means more efficient bow. Fourth is the characteristic of the bow. The drawweight is measured on 28 inches, but good bows hardens linearly, other bows like one of mine as well hardens suddenly in the end, and it can make it weaker than it feels. The reason is it can accelerate the arrow well only in the small fraction of the drawlenght.
how long and thick are the fiberglass rods?(sorry for my bad english)
Would strapping tape be a better choice for wrapping? It seems to hold up better to the elements.
what are you using to keep the fiber glass in place?
its all about drawlength
the recurve bow uses its own potential energy because of the the two curves, drawing the string back against the first curves has its own energy, then you have the second curves that are making the bow literally want to go back to its original position, and then the curve on the notches at the tips they are opposing the original force, that why the draw weight is only 45lbs and it has a higher velocity
The Traditional Bowyer's Bible 1,2 or 3 For more background info
Great jobe, dude! Way better than kipkay's version, who I think copied your idea lol
Man, no matter what their made of, all recurve bows look sexy
I think you will find a different result if you use a stiffer spine arrow. the light spine arrow you used in your video is more than likely flexing pretty good when you release it. take some video of you shooting it and slow it down to see the flex in the arrow. you can loose a lot of speed and momentum this way. arrows are made for specific weights or poundage for bows ,and this is the reason why. some wooden arrows have been known to snap if used in heavy weight bows if they are not made for them. hope this helps! good videos by the way keep them coming!!!!
i tried making the backyardbowyer's "youth target bow" bt a little bigger and i get about 30-40 pounds of draw at 28 inches depending on the weather. the best part though is the bow took about 15 mins to make
Its a known fact that a recurve is much faster pound for pound when draw weigh is concerned. I read a thread on some forum where a guy was stunned that his first 50# recurve was faster than his favorite 80# longbow. sound like you have a very similar situation.
now you have to make me one and send it to me
No, the problem is that the bow is too strong for the arrow, so the arrow is penetrating in an angle because it cant fly straight, so much of the power of the bow is being lost by the arrow not hitting the target straight.
The FiberGlass rods alone cost 16$ where i'm from.... dayum.
Great job!!!
A recurve bow was made so that it would take less strength too penetrate at short to medium range but once you go further out you'll find it less reliable, where's a long bow is better at medium to long range but it's harder to shoot.
The energy that you are transmitting to the arrow is proportional to the square of the displacement. If you are missing those last couple of inches of pull it greatly decreases the power of it. F=-kX W=-kX^2
Hey man I made my first one of these yesterday. Works great! Thanks!
Who the hell is this kid?
70 pund are too much for a light arrow. That's why it doesn't stick very much, the arrow can't fly straight with that much power
As an archer wanna-be who can't actually afford a good bow yet, knowing how to make a recurve to have some training while I save up would be fantastic!
Can you paint this?
I just made this and holy crap I'm extremely impressed with it's power, I used a dremal tool to make the notches Bc I don't have a file , and I might need to make the notches deeper but I'm afraid to Bc I don't want to cut through the PVC , I was going to use 4 rods but I didn't have enough room for the tape so I'm thinking of turning the extra rod into a big arrow . Also I have a question , if I shorten the string some would that compromise the bow in any way or  should I leave it the way it is ?
Just spray paint the bow black.
Draw distance, seems like the recurve has a deeper draw.
I'm not sure if it's been mentioned here before, but to me, it looks like you're almost hyper extending your bow arm. I understand that it might be a bit easier to hold the higher powered bows like that, but having a slight bend in your bow arm is a bit better for accuracy and comfort when shooting.   Source: am a bow hunter of five or six years.
It's not all about the weight of the arrow
recurve bows were made to be shorter for horseback archery, thats about all i know lol
This video is Fantastic!  I just recently read a quote that suggested that some of the greatest discoveries did not come from a "Eureka!" moment but rather from a, "that's funny" moment.  Intuition suggests the 70 lb bow should have better penetration.  The tests did not support the intuition.  Now you are off on a fact finding mission.  How cool is that?!
Mr. Alpha, you might find a little bit more detail about how receive bows work if you research how a mantis shrimp punches so hard. Awesome video though!
i love you
+ZednoughtAlpha how long was your paracord?
Eli how long was your paracord?
PLEASE use the metric system too.
Hey Alfa make the recurve bow it's really cool
I made this and i bought ZombieGoBoom ivan's zombie skull and tested it took 6-7 hits to penetrate the skull and a normal bow takes 2-3 but is pretty good i am trying to make a crossbow version
You should make a blowgun next
What u guys will need  Duck tape  5 feet 3/4 inch pvc Tape measure  Driveway markers/ fibreglass rods  Sharpie  Hack saw  File of some sort   You're welcome
can you make more builds like this
hey im a new youtuber and would like you to mabey mention me or give a shout out i watch a lot of your videos im a subscribers...i do things like your channel knife reviews i would like to have a couple more subscribers if you can please mention me or give a shout out. i wouldnt love anythhing more
ZednoughtAlpha the draw weight is the power of the bow, or the force behind the arrow. The elasticity of the bow determines the bows "snap", or the speed that the string travels. the better the snap, the quicker the arrow flies. more draw weight dose not mean faster, it just has more of an impact when it hits.  recurves in general are a high elasticity bow. they whip arrows because of the recurve design.  and great video by the way.
+ZednaughtAlpha you can heat up the ends of the PVC and bend them around a small cooking pot.
How to make a recurve bow please!
Hi I was just wonderig could you use tent poles instead of highway markers as they are made of fibreglass?? thanks
The Re-curve design manages to preserve the draw length (power stroke) of a much longer bow in a more compact design. That is why the Mongolians used them for mounted archery. Poundage is only half as important as then length of the draw. That is why despite crossbows averaging 300 lb pull weight, long bows shoot further and have better penetration even though they average much less at 115 lb (medieval war bow and war cross bow, modern bows usually have much less draw weight for hunting and practice shooting). The longer the draw, the more time the arrow has to accelerate before it leaves the spring. Remember that acceleration is more important than mass when calculating the energy of a projectile. Having a higher draw weight only benefits you if you can draw a full length. Even if you are at 80% the maximum draw length that can significantly change it's velocity. Think of it like when gunsmiths measure the muzzle velocity of a rifle vs a handgun. A longer barrel means the bullet inside has more time to accelerate. The exact same principle applies here.
What did you put in your target boxes?
Bro make a karambit   Like so alpha sees this
Plz show the curved bow
I'm interested in how recurve adds more power as well, i always seen the curves on the end to get in the way wen in CQC or a tight space, i would like to see how to make one.
lol terraria music
the phone call at the end of this video throws it into the hall of fame of YouTube videos...XD
The entire point of the recurve bow was to reduce draw weight while maintaining firepower, not sure on the science behind why it works though.
sweet arms bro
make the recurve!!!
Where can one acquire such lovely fiberglass rods?
the energy transmited to the arrow depends of the force(in Newtons) and the displacement(in meters) by the equation Work = force × displacement. So, the 45 pounds bow maybe stretchs(displaces) more than the 65 pounds bow.
great vid man thanks for posting this I'm actually subscribing
please do a recurve bow. excellent video lucky you got that recurve as a gift. is it possible to do a collaborative with the person that sent it to you. i think it's possible if you and he make a video each and send to each other to fine tune and then upload here on youtube.
I have a challenge for you try to make full armor out of soda cans and bottles and duck tape
I just stumbled on your video... and i'm happy! Always loved archery but i never could afford buying a new bow, and i want a classic desing, not those modern  fancy thingy bows. Now i might just do my own. Thanks!
I think its the force and  the small area  that  makes most  of the  potential energy  in the bow into  kinetic energy to the arrow ,when with the monster bow lots of the potential energy doesn't convert I into kinetic energy into the arrow  making it slow because you made it to thick which is  .this the same reasons when hunters make home made bows out of wood the don't make it to thick Hope  this answers you question Zednaughtalpha
Can you make a cross bow with the ammo?
where the hell did you buy fiberglass rods for less than like 9 dollars a piece
epic as always
the recurve on a bow makes the arrow leave the bow faster
i went to home depot and it cost me $22.63 without the paracord :(
Awesome project, i really like your stuff.
lol, he uses a release.
I can tell you don't know a single thing about archery
the recurved bow make the arrow travel at a higher velocity
Wowwwwwww
i make recurves all the time, and i love watching how other people make theres, great video
Goddamn it, Now I'm on archery kick and just made my 7th bow. Eli, you little shit. lol
Good stuff! More archery please, I too would like to know how to make a backyard recurve bow.
How do you make the arrows and the what ever the fuck the release sort of thing?
Math. It is the length of the draw and the weight of it that make the power of the bow.
What was that white dude trying to make, his suicide letter?
A normal bow like the bow you made in this video is well a normal bow. Now the recurve bow is more powerful with that curve at the end of the bow it pulls the string tieter so more power. And a pulley bow lets you hold the string at full draw longer as it kinds of i guess puts less weight on the archer. hope i got it sort of right and helps you out. :)
What knot did you use?
wow the quality is absolutely amazing
the purpose of a recurve bow is to give more power for less draw by making the bow curve in a different way than is "natural" for the way the material is bent, working like a longbow having the arms snap back into place only faster and with a higher strength output
Eli, you're so close to 200k subs I can smell it. I still love the squares...
Yess I'd like to see
Rest in peace proper form and limb tension
WHERE DO U GET THOSE MATERIALS IN AUSTRALIA!?!?$%$# ARE THEY CALLED THE SAME?#%
What exactly was your brother trying to burn?
Dat forearm though.
Is that paracord on all those bows, and if not what can you use?
I'm going to send you some candy when I can I will send you a potato too and a pic of some stuff and more candy
Just made one of these, it works great.
Keep it up man love the vids!
Dude please show the recurve
try making something from cs:go please
make slingshot!!! it will be greate
Wait, what is the length of the fiberglass rods?
I'm thinking of making wooden weapons on Youtube what name should i go with
when you shoot a bow dont throw your hand away when you release
you should work at television, the announcer.
There are two main reasons why the lighter recurve performs so well.  1. the recurve raises the acceleration of the arrow wuring the last bit of the drive, because when the string hits the recurve it shortens the string basically and that raises the speed of the string.  2. the higher the draw weight, the heavier the arrow has to be. A bow has a natural limit of possible arrow acceleration, if it gets near to it, a lot of energy is not transfered into the arrow (like hitting something that is already moving away from you), so the draw weight is wasted.  AND I do not know what you used to stuff the box, but for that kind of test you need a homogenous target (like foam) to be sure the resistance is consistent.
Sup man! i am not trying to be a bitch (and you know what comes) but, i must ask about your realese teqnike. i have mysealf been training archery with the recurve and compund bows for over five years, just saying that your release looks flashy as fuck but does it really work long distance? (i know in the vid you only did like 5 - 10 meters but still) have you tried it longer distances?
have you ever thought about trying to make something by blacksmithing
Eli y don't u post as often?
Recurve bows are, in essence, snappier than a straight bow. This is because you have a curve facing away from the draw. This gives more distance from the resting to the full draw points at the curve. As we see in springs, the more distance you push or pull the spring, the more energy is stored. And, for many springs, the rate itself is linear while the total work is more quadratic. This means that the bow can be shorter and have the same weight.  But why does it perform as well as the long bow? Like I mentioned, the bow is snappier due to the curve. If you know what impulse is, then you know that the impulse force has an inverse relationship with time. So, when your time is decreased, your force is increase. Since a recurve is faster than a straight bow, the impulse is much greater on the recurve.
what did your brother want a nail for :X
what would happen if you made one with a double layer of pvc?
Great videos man, Thanks :)
Hey Eli, just a suggestion, remember the penguin? You should make something like that again, accept like six feet long and heavy. Not very practical but it would look cool, and everyone knows that whoever looks cooler wins the fight.
that's your brother right? if so did he like his grappling hook?
I know you took inspiration from samurai for your current armor build, have you ever thought of making a katana-like apocalypse weapon? Maybe some kind of sawback katana with, of course, a flat black paint job.
it would be awesome to see a tutorial for the bow that the subscriber gave u. That thing is sick
Thanks for introducing me to another awesome channel man, much appreciated!
Eli where do you work, I was wondering how you manage
Can you make a crossbow of one of your bows? That would be awesome!
What's the name of the knot?
I definitely would love to see how to make the recurve bro. They are reputed in ancient combat
Could I add the pulleys from the other one to make a compound bow
Wow you can really see the difference in quality
Could u do a giveaway
What diameter rods are you using?
make the recurve!
Are u going to show us a video of how to make the recurve bow
You should make a vlog series called Zedthought Alpha
you're a very good shot, and make it look easy. nice video.
+ZednaughtAlpha Have you ever considered making a mechanical weapon? Or even clockwork?
would it work to take the nylon out of the 550 cord, use that for draw string and the empty cord wrapped around for grip?
new to your channel. thanks for the great vids. hope your getting rest.
I love how genuine this guy is, thx for making such informative videos and trying to educate the people!
how do you weigh the draw weight?
when are you going to do more samurai armor videos
to me it looked as though the arrow bounced off the wall behind with the heavy bow.  I think it penetration deeper, but rebounded back
cool , what about to -how to do- or - DIY -  X-Bow  ?
A recurve bow vid would be awesome
Can you explain what the yellow fiberglass "markers" are originally  used for and where to get them? Also I've seen people decorate pvc with bunson burners for a cooler wood looking affect (not melting plastic, just scorching it to various browns)
do another armor build
The curve puts more stress adding with the fiberglass giving it alot more power
from what I understand,  paracord is really stretchy.  You should try a bowstring made of polypropylene twine. Its like 5 buck for 200 yards at home depot
that very impressive PVC bow and arrow
make a arrow with wood without steel tip.
Now make easy arrow no power tool :)
Where do you get driveway markers
curious about change of setting, Eli?
You should show us how to make a forearm guard in case the string somehow smacks your inner arm
Did you add an arrow rest?
dude u know what's awesome my name i Eli 2
Make a video on how to make a release mechanism
I thought u were making a full suit of aumor
Hello
Hey
Want to learn a bit about bows and how good you can become at shooting them by practicing? Read the book series, a personal favorite of mine, Rangers Apprentice
The recurve bow is actually Mongolian technology and when it hits the curve it pushes with more force. But quick question does it matter if I have square fiber glass instead of round ones?
You look like Matt ogus
What kind of knot did you use for stringing the Bow?
Next can you show us how to make some arrows? It would be a nice addition to the bows!
How thick is teh Paracord?  Wont Nylon just get bad after a while?
awesome video and the new camera looks great
Hope you keep making videos like this 👍🏻
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiii just wanted to say AWSOME VIDOES
How do u send you pic's? I made some shoulder armor for you to rate how much I suck!
What is the Fiberglass and Peracord in Dutch? I cant find any translations for it ...
why the hell are you useing a release on a barebow???
I'm probably gonna make one or two of these for myself and a friend. The recurve is definitely something I'd wanna see.
Hey Eli, how's your friend Uriel doing?
The recurve bow alows you to drawn almost the double of the force of a normal long bow of the same size
My friend would like to know if you are a virgin, and if you can reply she would be happy because she has a crush on you.
What did you use for the arrow rest?
I made on just with a highway marker and worked just fine my mom asked where i learned to make it and i said a Youtuber i usually watch then she said wow he is doing right then
You should do a video on how to make throwing knives
I just love your videos
How much are you getting your PVC for? At my local hardware store it's only 29 cents per foot.
Could you please PLEASE make a video on the recurve bow and yes it costs less power to draw back and shoots ALOT harder
re curves are generally faster, long bows are generally more stable
Dude, I NEED to build that recurve bow. Do you have any idea how it was made? If so, can you make a video showing it? That's a sick puppy.
Great video. This is one I'm going to attempt myself.
is there an uk alternative to fibreglass highway markers(live in UK)
For cutting the fiber rods, may I suggest a small tubing cutter?
Can anyone tell me where can I buy those fiberglass markers?
Whats up Eli, could you possibly make arrows? I think it would be cool to make arrows for cheap and just shooting around. Thanks
MAKE THE RECURVE!!! And have you done any archery in the past?
+ZednoughtAlpha I would love to see you make that recurve bow, I want to make one for myself!  Why spend hundreds when you can make it yourself for much less!  #cheapskate
you should make a homemade karambit
Hey do you think you could make a vertical crossbow? By that i mean the limbs going up and down rather than left to right.
You should burn the rope on the recurved bow before it frays
Can you plz show us how to make arrows!!!!!
You should make like, a hidden blade or miniature flamethrower... that would be soooo cool +ZednaughtAlpha
This is by far the most simple, easiest pvc bow tutorial I've seen. Love this channel! One question, how long are the driveway markers in inches?
Recurve bows give the bow more snap, since more stuff is bending. In a recurve bow the limbs are bending the the recurve is "unraveling". So when you release, both snap back. In a long bow just the limbs are bending and thus just the limbs snap back
Can you make a tutorial for a slingshot with only handtools
i love how you post your videos so often!(:
Hey ZednoughtAlpha , Recurve basically is a simple idea of a compound bow: once you pull past the curve, then it gets easier.
you should do your vlogs again
Hey ZedNoughtAlpha I was wondering since a couple videos back you said you weren't interested in making weapons so much. So what are you interested in creating? Let me know,  thanks
I actually would find that recurve tutorial to be useful. Also what was your brother making with fire and paper?
ZednoughtAlpha man please tell me how did u make the arrows
The point of the curves on a recurve bow are to give you more power when releasing the arrow by increasing the force when drawn ps i love your videos you have inspired me to make my own channel making wepons thank you.
mkkkddk
mkkkddk
Eli unstring your bows after use lets the bows life be twice as long
Eli unstring your bows after use lets the bows life be twice as long
You should make a set of inexpensive throwing knives.
If you can't find road markers old tents poles are made of fibreglass
anyone know what he was using to draw the bow?
Hey bud, nice shooting and great videos. Are you using a trigger or tab to fire your bow? I just notice your hand kicking out a fair way.
I love all the weapons and armor and bows, I really do, I can't wait for the next video to come out, but don't you ever want to build something other than weapons and armor? like you know, making art, make something look real good ( not saying your builds aren't cool, they're awesome looking) like...I dunno..maybe some kind of mechanical stuff, clockwork ( not literal clocks :p ) a catapult..or like an awesome snake..thing for props, something to show off your skills. but I still love your vids, keep up the good work..sorry this was long
he should put his armor on then have someone shoot at I'm with the bows XD
What are you using to pull the string back?
You are an awesome inspiration
Where can i buy arrows? I am under 18.
Recurve bows have more get up and go than a normal bow of the same draw weight, but have a much flatter trajectory.
Make attack on Titan swords from the anime. Please! Man at arms reforged won't do it.
What was your brother burning haha
Yea the recurve gives you higher arrow speed for lower draw weight
Dude what kind of PVC pipe do i need? like theres so many to choose by xD like what kind of millimeter do i need
Thought. Did you string the recurve bow with paracord as well?
9/10 would watch again. I'd watch the recurve video if you made it.
how long are the driveway markers?
just saw his first video. his hair though
You should use a mask when sawing fiber glass
You should make some sort of arm protection bracelet so u dont risk snapping your wrist with the bowstring! ;)
The recurve offers the same concept as the reverse draw crossbows you made, giving it essentially a longer draw and therefore more time under pressure. It also coincidentally allows a lighter draw in the beginning and a harder one towards full draw than a standard bow. Hope this helps bro! Keep it up!
yo ZednoughtAlpha can you make more PVC weapons please
I would enjoy seeing you make a recurve bow and I think the curve gives it more power for a lower draw weight and is more efficient at storing power
Hey alpha I would love to see a re curve bow
What can I use other than fibre class rods
hey eli (i don't know if that is how you spell your name so sorry) could you make a video on how to make a cheap armor stand to work on your armor, in most of your newer videos in the garage there is a armor stand and i was wondering how (if you did) get the stand to your size and how you made it =)
If anyone is wanting to make a bow and learn how to shoot, please join an archery club and get taught how to properly shoot a bow. I've seen people in the past dislocating limbs and straining muscles due to horrible technique.
make a pvc recurve bow
showing off are we? 3:10 and at 6:09 with the "monster bow" you did not pull in the middle of the bow
What is ninety degrees in whatever Britain uses? Don't say a right angle.
hey there, I really liked this project and I wanna do it myself but I can't find those kind of driveway markers in my country.what else do you think I can use to replace them ?
the recurve bow works better because the curve on the end. when the bow string hits it I snaps forward giving it more power
Great video recruve bows release the arrow faster
Do you do archery? you're pretty good with a bow.
What can i replace the fiber glass rod with ?
U should see The weather in Michigan I it was sunny then rainy twice in a day
U should see The weather in Michigan I it was sunny then rainy twice in a day
Lool the end bit tho
how can peoples dislike this... :(  continue your nice video im a fan with a couple of friends too :P good job with theses build !! from canada xD
i am not sure about the different but it could be that the the angle between bow and tendon of the bow is a different. The Monster is strong in his basic stats but the recurved bow have this Curve to maximise the angle by drawing. At the end, it could be that the Monster-bow ist stronger, but you can draw the Curved maby two times more than the Monster one so you can put more force in the arrow with less muscle use. but its only Theory so pls dont mind if i am wrong x__x' EDIT: yeah the difference is in the traction. if you curve the ends to a maximum of 90° parallel to the handle, you could get a higher Draw wight. And addition to that, you get one very freaky bow which seems your using one bow bachwards. maby thats more interesting, to do separate bows (maby 3 or 4) with different curves and see whats the best one.
The reason why the heavy bow penetrated equally to the recurve bow likely has to do with you not being able to pull the heavy bow to the limit.
Nice!
the point of the recurve bow lets you shoot it wothout it vibrating as much tht way you can shoot it for a longer time
zednought I did some research on a re curve and advantages to it here is what I found  A recurve bow has tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. By definition, the difference between recurve and other bows is that the string touches a section of the limb when the bow is strung. A recurve bow stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow. A recurve will permit a shorter bow than the simple straight limb bow for a given arrow energy and this form was often preferred by archers in environments where long weapons could be cumbersome, such as in brush and forest terrain, or while on horseback.
I don't know about your new camera, but you should shoot these bows in slow motion. Both close up on the bow and in like 3rd person. :)
Really cool, cant wait to try that!
I dont know why, but your voice prevents me from taking a poop.
Man, I really love bows! Please try to figure out how to build this other one hahah Great video, as aways ^^
I use a 35 lbs
I know this is totally irrelevant but I can totally open any of his video and just listen to his voice all day long.
Nice ring tone.
Yeah, the re curve bows, (In comparison to, say, a longbow would be the best analog for your monster bow in my eyes) generally have a higher initial velocity than a longbow with MUCH reduced draw weight, but don't shoot as far.  Because of this aspect, they were often used as horse bows, for use in horse archery, an example being the mongols, where range isn't really a factor, but draw weight and penetration power are.  That's just my personal views and knowledge attained through research and experience, you may have different opinions, I don't know.  Great video, btw, thanks for making a guide on using hand tools, I can't really afford power tools. I think many of us who don't have access to power tools would really like it if you made more videos akin to this one in the future.
3:30 looks like we got a badass over here
I've seen the backyard bowyer and still like your videos so much more and got the inspiration to actually build it
Can I use a different type of string? because paracord has a tendency to stretch
Keep up the gooooood work Eli I've been watching your vids. For a loooooooong time and for a good reason you rock
Having some Montana weather?
plz make a recurve bow with a fiberglass or graphite tent pole core. PLZ!!!!
That recurve looks sick! Definitely figure that shit out man
i love ur videos :) keep doing what ur doing :3
You should try your hand at shaping PVC! Its not to hard and produces some really nice results
the PVC won't break when you bend it?
a recurve bow stores more energy and uses it more efficiently
LMAOOOO I love the extra clips at the end!!  Really gave me a laugh xD
This is finally something i can try
Its about length of pull. take for example a 200 lb crossbow. if it only has 12 inches to push the arrow, it would be comparable to a 60 lb crossbow that is pulled back 26 inches.
im still waiting for that grappling hock test
Man you're good at making videos
Your brother cracked me up lol
A recurve bow is curved bow to retain tension while keeping a lower draw weight.
@ 3:46 Are the bows in the corner permanently stringed ? O.o If yes please unstring them if you aren't using them, that way you will have fun with them much longer.
He phoned you because he didn't want to intrude on your video? :P
great simple build.  I cant believe Imma say this since I think I mention past music being a tad loud in a vid, but in this one the music is really good but too quiet? When I do the audio post for a doco or cooking show or whatever I ride levels so when theres no talking the music increases in volume to fill space. or if in a hurry I'll just sidechain the vocal to the music so the music subtly dips when the presenter is talking. That music sounded great so it'd be nice to hear it (could only get the details by turning it up when you werent talking.  just an idea since you are obviously receiving more music nowadays. cheers Bruz.

I think the recurve bow has much higher arrow velocity, which explains good penetration :)
im not really sure about bows or anything, but for your monster bow, it seems that you are not really holding it at the center or anywhere near it, unlike the other bows where it looks like you hold it at the center. As I said, i don't know anything about bows, so correct me if I'm wrong.
If you end up making your own PVC re-curve bow, PLEASE make a video of it. I've heard of people using heat guns in order to flatten and curve the ends of the bow but i would love to see a video of one done well as opposed to people saying "well, when i was younger, my older brother did this and that' and yada yada yada. You get my meaning. Thanks from a proud subscriber.
when i first heard of the whole pvc bow thing i assumed the pvc pipe would just snap - have you ever had any do this? great vid btw!
make an arrow pliz
What keeps the core from falling out from the bottom?
hi ! what is that yellow strips thing ?
ZednoughtAlpha I thinks you should make some arrows which like the spears can be used once then got rid of you could use bamboo canes
No.1 do you think you could make a wooden bow and No.2 if I send you Vegemite will you eat it out of the jar I just love peoples reactions to Vegemite
+zednoughtalph can u resume your full armor build because I want to use it to be a zombie apocalypse survivor at comic con
I think that the recurve and super monster bow got the same distance bc your arm can only draw so much power meaning your muscle is the limiting factor instead of the bow power
Where can i find pvc pipe in europe? Been searching everywhere
Hey Eli would you be able to make a sword I feel that it could test your skill and if your viewers try it can test there😃
The quality is awesome man! :D I like how giving you a call would interrupt the video less than if he knocked.. xD He seems cool tho. :P
i really like the bloopers at the end
That ending 😂
+ZednoughtAlpha do u watch backyard bowyer he does loads of pvc bows and stuff
If you use a finger glove instead of a release you can get a bit of a longer draw.  And also if you raise your elbow up a little higher during your draw you will use your back muscles more instead of your biceps.
dude please make the recurve bow, I''ve watced a few other people make them but there  videos aren't as good as yours usually are.
Is it your brother at the end of your video ? Because he looks just like you
my 80 pound re-curve bow goes straight through 30Cm (12") styrophome and actually lost one of my arrows due to it going straight through the other side and skitted out into my mates paddock. but i find it a lot easier to pull back if you pull from the ground up, helps a lot using that technique i can only just pull back my dad's 120 pound bow using that technique.
Plz make a recurve bow with no power tools
When is your next steel armor tutorial
I'm not interested in making good anything that you make because I know I can never do it xD however I do think that your channel is extremely interesting lol I just like the way how you make nothing out of something
Recurve bows work off of a form of leverage, making them much more powerful than normal bows of the same size and material.  This was to allow the hunter or bowman to use less energy drawing the arrow back so he could in theory shoot more arrows in the long run Or allow someone with a weaker arm to shoot arrows with the same effectiveness as someone with a stronger arm and normal bow.  With all that said, once crossbows came into being, normal bowman started to die out.  It takes very little effort and training to shoot a crossbow compared to using a bow of any shape or size.
Lol the bloopers at the end
Please do a House tour
You should make brass knuckles or knuckle duster
the weight of the tips of the bow matters more, thinner lighter tips spring forward harder and push the string forward fasta
you should make a tomahawk
That is honestly interesting that 2 different bows, by draw weight and form, put out the same penetration.
hey man if the world comes to a end can i call you? we can maybe team? i go hunting alot and you could make my weapons! perfect team. lol jk, but if the world comes to a end your surviving for a long time!
Please make a tutorial video on the PVC recurve bow!!! Awesome videos, keep it up!
Good vid like always. By the way, I really like your music selection lately... Keep up the good work!!!
What is that thing on your hand
Please do a double weighted bo staff.
You should make an arrow out of hacksaw or a throwing star
I would be nice if you show us how to make the subscriber bow
Please make a recurve bow
very interested in the recurve
+1 vote for the recurve bow video
off topic, do you workout? looking pretty beefy man. awesome bow by the way.
You're beautiful heh
Like the new angles and camera!
what knots did you use
For a pvc recurve bow, all you need is a heat gun to shape it!
Awesome vid
Whats the name of the tool you were using to pull back the arrows
Yeah ricurves are generally more efficient than longbows.
Hey where do you place the arrow and draw on the bow
Can make a sword mixed with axe also I love ur idea are really good and I would believe in you for advice for a zombie apocalypse
Loved the video man, good stuff.
The curves in recurve bows are so, even with the same draw wait or draw length, it can pull the sting forward faster giving it extra speed. sorry if this is s shit explanation.
the recurve helps keep the size of the bow down but also not losing any power from a shorter bow
yes a recurve  speed by about 35% give a % or too. a long bow was almost twice as think as a recurve bow in medieval times. PS there are a lot of videos explaining this. hope this helps . I have a YouTube channel myself.

recurves 'revcurve' as in they recoil to their initial stance faster due to multiple stress bends versus just one
To learn how to make a pvc recurve bow, check at the backyardbowyer :D
ZednoughtAlpha what is the approximate diameter of the highway markers??
omg can you please put bloopers at the end of all your vids
can you make more masks/helmet's
As a Mongolian I can say that the composite bow has a very similar design as your bow. The bow is so powerful because you're forcing it to bend against it's natural curve. Otherwords, you are able to store up more energy or greater strain than normal long bows. Btw, Loving the vids man
The reason the recurve bow is more powerful is because when it is drawn, the limbs are bent back, when the arrow is released, the limbs become straight/slightly bent forward where as with a long bow, they go from bent back to less bent back but still bent back.
+ZednoughtAlpha are you going to be selling any more weapons or armor? You make really cool stuff that I couldn't dream of making myself.
+ZednoughtAlpha I am so happy I been looking forward to getting a new bow but now I can just make. Dude props to you.
i can make a weak bow for close to free (like 20 cents for string) with a good pocket knife i found
I would like to know how to make the monster bow and the recurve bow!
+ZednougtAlpha I would love to see you make the bow that your subscriber gave to you!
The bow looks every good not to kill an animal but hit a person like hell
I've been subscribed to you for almost a year now and I can see that you've put a lot of work in and your videos have gotten a lot better.
when are you doing your next fan mail video
would love to see a video on how to make the recurve bow. also, did a quick search, and the curved limbs on the recurve bow store and deliver more energy than a standard bow of the same size (slight paraphrase from wikipedia). that's why the Mongols loved it so much. they could make a shorter, more maneuverable bow for shooting from horseback.
What is the subscriber bow made out of?
I think the reason the re-curve bow is more powerful is because the energy is being stored in 3 curves rather than just one. This allows it to release that energy for a longer distance giving the arrow more time to accelerate.
Cool bow dude!! I made one similar to this !!'
Zednaughalpha, I'm wanting to mail or you something and probably will after I finish the letter. But the only problem is I don't know your address and can't find it. I know you're a busy person, but would you mind replying the address to me? Thanks bro.   - long term subscriber
who in the hell does not like these vids i think they are good vids and he is a pretty smart kid for what he is doing !!! keep up the good work eli!!
Yo eli you said you would do the grappling hook test when your brother comes back? And i didnt see a test for it could you please do the test for it because im still excited to this day about it, btw i love your awesome videos you keep making interesting stuff idk if ur still reading? But just wanted to say that u haven't uploaded the grappling hook test
Why don't you have any armpit hair?
medieval english long bows had 120 lb draw power, so you felt nothing! haha, better train those muscles.
The better built a bow is, and the less unnecessary mass it has, the "faster" it will be. What this really means is that the bow is more efficiently using its draw weight. With a large diameter PVC bow, a lot of the force just goes into normalizing the PVC itself, making the arrow fly with less speed a force. The fiberglass helps this, but it will only do so much. With any recurve bow, the difference between strung and unstrung is quite substantial, meaning that there is already pressure on the bow, due to its structure, before you even pull the arrow back. Much more than a long bow, in most cases. So, 2 points, really. Firstly, unnecessary mass will make the bow fire more slowly. Secondly, the more tension in the bow before drawing the greater speed the arrow will have (with traditional bows, in most cases). I've made about 13 bows of different types and materials, and I was surprised when my 80b bundle bow hit with less authority then my 45b finished short bow. The more efficiently the bow is built, the less unnecessary mass, the better it will use its draw weight. Hope that was helpful/entertaining. I very much enjoy your videos and I wish you the best.
You should try to make a kerambit knife!
Please learn how to make it
Hey Eli I'm the one who sent the bow. I was curious on the method you used to weigh them. Granted there are many factors that could affect the draw force.(namely my bad guessing) But if it has been shot fairly regularly it will break in, meaning it will get used to bending and flexing so it wont have as much resistance. my guess is that it was originaly 50-52 lbs and dropped to 45-48ish, just a theory. For the core i used three fiberglass rods one was 1/4in two were 3/16in. the 3/16 in was cut at 18in. ant the 1/4in was cut at 10in. then they were centered in the bow. Hope I helped if, not... oh well.
Kansas you make a English long bow out off wood
Id like to see you do a vid with your brother.
please show us how to make it I want to make it for my buddy coming back from the military
Man id love to make it, especially with those fiberglass rods, problem is, its hard to get a hold of those where i come from, But that recurve bow looks amazing! I wonder if the PVC deforms over time if you use it, but i guess thats one advantage of using the rods, less deformation,   But i hope that you'll make a vid about making that recurve bow! Cant wait!
Ya those damn fiber glass splinters.
Make a recurve bow
Yo Zednought, I really love your videos you are now one of my favorite youtubers you just make such interesting stuff on this channel. Keep up the good work man
A recurve snaps at the beginning and end of a shot because of the curves and it adds a lot more power
When are you going to make that mace
Hey Zed, new sub. I'm enjoying these videos and I love your personality and how you've imprinted that into your videos and your weapon ideas are pretty badass.  archery is a particular interest of mine and while PVC bows are cool, I am hardly going to take one down to my local range. However, I would be interested to see how you would make a riser that you could attach store-bought limbs to. you could even weaponize the riser itself with spikes or such and it's pretty open ended as to what you could attach to the riser.  I think you could tackle many different parts/accessories for the bow as well if you are ever stuck for ideas.  keep up the good work.
Eli question. How do you judge which hand to hold the bow with and what hand to pull the string with? or would you just use your dominant hand to pull the string with?
Hey Eli,  Just wanted to ask why so serious lately? I think alot of us long time subscribers notice that you aren't as funny in recent vids. Not complaining, especially with low budget builds lol i love those. Just saying we love seeing you have fun.  Thanks! you are an inspiration.  P.S. make airsoft. LOTS of airsoft.
we made these bows at my school for an archery camp we did
i suggest using the 75 lb bow to make a full size crossbow video
Dude, just saying this, do NOT use a weak arrow on heavier bows... what's going to happen is the power of the bow is going to be so much, its going to tear the arrow in half unless your using an arrow made for much stronger bows.
I would love to see you make a Recurve Bow!
that was a failed tag
@ZednoughtAlpha where do you get your driveway markers from I'm trying to make 5 foot fiberglass darts for my pvc atlatl and the only ones I've found were on eBay for 72$ for a set of 50 I only need about six darts
the point of a recurve bow is to get more power out of a lower draw weight
a little kid can easily build this bow....a perfect challenge for me!
nice bow
Are you using your new camera to record this? Looks awesome! Btw was that your brother?
This is so helpful I am trying to stay cheap and I've been wanting a bow for a long time this is awesome but how much would a rat tail file and a Hacksaw cost?
I second the idea of the pvc crossbow. Set to a solid wood stock and using thin plastic coated airplane cable with strong pulleys, I'll bet you could make a relatively cheap "zombie apocalypse" style weapon with plenty of penetrating power with a boot strap for easy draw. Trigger mechanism could be as easy as a side mounted thumb loop to pull down and release (unsafe in some ways but simple). Just a thought, keep up the good work bro
How can I make the arrows and thnx for the bow its really genius of u :)
Put that 70 pound bow horizontal as the arm of a ballista.
Recurve makes the strung snap forward faster
Recurve makes the strung snap forward faster
re-curve bows give you better "muzzle velocity" for less draw than longbows of equivalent weight
Eli, when you release your arrows, don't jerk your arm away. It can throw off accuracy
So u know the recurved now is designed to straighten when u draw so it's easier to fully extend
MAKE A RECURVE BOW VIDEO!!!
how can I make the arrows
That's interesting. It appears as if the recurve adds some draw distance to the design. This allowing a greater snap in the string. Though, I know nothing about bows.
How about easy and cheap arrows next, keep up the good work
Great vid
Blooper funny af lol, nice video man!
Hey zednought, i really liked the lighting of this video, Keep it up
to make a video how to make the Monster bow
*Recurve bow* 									 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 								 												 A recurve bow is a bow with limbs that curve away from the archer when unstrung. A recurve bow stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow.

For kicks I once made a long bow out of a piece of Brazilian redwood and made it 9 feet tall. That thing had a draw of 320 pounds. I had to mount it to a frame as a bilista, but it buried an arrow a foot deep into the hill behind my target after just lancing clean through it.
recurves are very springy, thats why it was launched faster

You should ReallY either Invest In some top quality arrows or make some.
You should make your own recurve bow, just make sure you give me credit :P
Hi
Hey man I was wondering why not just use patreon? We know that you're in a financially tough situation and I think your fans appreciate you enough that you would be able to get some money to help you out. I feel like you make great content and I get a real sense of what you must be going through trying to balance real life issues and whatnot.
Please make a trident!!!!
i guess that the 60lbs longbow is intended to shoot heavier arrows, you should try diferent combinations of bow/arrow o/
hey man, im a new subscriber (like...today subscriber) but I have watched quite a lot of your videos. at first when I saw your video (the krieg's buzz axe video) I thought "well, whats the punk kid have to say?" but I kept an open mind, and I have come to enjoy your videos greatly. and they make me want to make more cool stuff. but as a new sub, I wanted to say, I like your style of videos, and you have a dry but hilarious sence of humor, and I am inspired by your videos. keep up the great work, and you will go far. (also, if you haven't gotten a logo yet, or need any other visual art done, feel free to contact me, and I will come up with art stuffs, and if you like it cool, if not, no big deal. and I will do it all for free, I just like doing art)
Was wondering why the vid was longer lol you should put outtakes at the end of all your videos, these ones were great!!! Lol
You've gained a huge amount of muscle mass dude, well done! I'm 'mirin! Awesome bow, it's amazing how really simple it is, I bet once you make that you could just hammer them out and make a ton of them real quick. Surprisingly useful thing to learn. :D btw no homo but you have a very unique face, i'm not at all shy to say that you're a handsome guy but i'm curious to know if you have a particular ethnic background because you have a unique face imo, but i mean that as a compliment, but you look like you could have slight asian dna or native american so no offense is intended. love your videos. <3
make the recurve :D :D
make the recurve :D :D
It would be great to make the recurve!
3,764 view club woot hoot.
well I just finished making one and then this happens.
next bow video.. recurve? pleaaassseeeee :P
you have legit stole this whole video idea from another uploader, like all the tools are the same and its obvious you watched his video that how much you took from it. theirs no problem with this but i really think you should at least credit him for the idea. (the chanel is backyardbowyer) im just saying kinda rude dude!
you should make  a karamdit
I really want to see how to make the re-curve bow.
That recurve bow is sick, nice work whoever made that!
Just get some pvc and paracord, make a fire and heat it over that, ive made heaps of bows while camping using fires.
make a video of how to make the arrows pls ;)
What kind of rivets and rivet gun do you use?
nice bro keep it up
look up _archer's paradox_ to explain why the heavier bow did not penetrate as far as expected.
Hey zednaut love your channel
would love to learn how to make a recurve bow.
Do you have a 3D Printer?
Recurve bows allow for equal draw weight in a shorter bow length compared to a straight or long bow.
What happened to vlogofeli
At the apocalypse, you'd be famous for creating easy weapons of the wreckage.
That extra part was pretty funny lol
Can someone explain what the other guy was doing  ps, I find your videos really intresting
The purpose of a recurve now is more power with less draw the extra curves allow this to happen
i spelled you name wrong yes i know your real name
hi zednot
yes on the recurve!
Awesome work friend. I love your videos. Good work, keep it up.
the curves on either end of the recurve bow cause it to snap into place faster
I want to see you turn one of these into a crossbow.
Hail Alpha
sup
Yes. Yes. Yes.
The recurve bow is designed to pull back easier and the "monster" bow has a draw weight that is probably to much for the arrow which decreases speed and accuracy.
Hey Zednought. Long time subscriber (Not that I'm in anyway responsible for your success. Hard work is probably the main contributor). I think the first video I saw was one of your bodyweight training videos. Your quality has gone up! Keep it up sir.
