Why was this actually so entertaining?
So funny, love it!
Yep they kicked me off all my YouTube accounts lol oh well lol, lets throw ourselves under the bus a little more, oh the customers reading this know exactly what I mean being the real Walt Disney of course is who I truly am, and they all wanted to close my mouth Rihanna including in the music and film industries actually but whatever Im going to rectify all these things I can assure of that fact.
This made my day better.
This was so much fun to watch.
This video feels professional.
Lucky 🦋,
Beautiful
Really clear and easy to follow.
This was fun AND informative.

Loved the transitions.
Even withaut all this, Rihanna is prety girl. Hugs to my brother Asap. L❤ve you.
Can’t wait to see more.

Rihanna you're a legend
i'm obssessed with the way she speaks about the things she doesn't like as much (forehead, double chin, etc) without sounding like she hates them/herself
You are cute Rihanna
It does help that she has an absolutely beautiful face ! Love her ❤❤
Not sure why I’m watching a makeup vid, but this girl is 🔥
Always be fabulous ISA & BELLA 💅🩷

She’s young and she has a cute little face. She doesn’t really need make up.
Wooooow❤
I actually thought she was about to take her make up off .  Looks better with out make up in my opinion, still pretty though
I genuinely feel that Rihanna and I could have been friends. Thanks for the makeup tutorial, definitely feeling inspired ✨
Her bathroom looks so pretty
Rhianna can u send me your whole Fenty collection JK

Concealer to cover “bad decisions” I see you riri ❤️‍🩹
Bellissima e davvero simpatica ❤❤❤ 💯😘💕
She seems like such a nice person
@nilaytoprak
OMG 😭 7 years later i notice the horrible foundation Match
Her foundation, concealer and contour are the WRONG COLOR. More than that...  This video is ultimately Sad… she comes off as a child who has nothing to say and nothing genuine to offer.
The most overrated celebrity ever
I love Rihanna. She's so adorable.  So real.  Her Rebel parfum is still one of my favorite scents to this day.
Rihanna haz una canción bonita una chava que conoci en la mañana
I don’t even apply makeup but I watched all 😂 Always nice to see Rihanna
I bet she's super cute without. And hair  is flawless. Beautiful I love ❤❤ her 💞
I wish i was that person watching her make this video in person lmao shss so funny

hello... i love highlighter too... but tricky over 40.... what is the liquid highlighter rihanna uses on the inner corner of her eyes.... it was a goldy colour... thanks....
Lots of fun. Loved it!
literally needs no make up
DAAAAAG!! For someone who has her own makeup business, she should be able to pick the correct shade and tone of foundation!! The bronzer was a closer match than the foundation!
Riri has thee most perfect foredhead !!!
I don't know about that because she knew back then you are very funny
TO ALL OF WOMEN OF THE WORLD AND MEN OF THE WORLD WOULD YALL MIND  SUPPORTING MY BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER RIHANNA BY BUYING HER FENTY PRODUCTS
she basically made her face look bad with painting it a different colour lol, i thought the start was with makeup
Is she OK? She’s surprised everything she’s like you have that is he surprised that you have a baby or something like that that surprise of her own lipstick she’s crazy.

Fake hair and color contact lenses. And she is already wearing some makeup 💄. Really 🤯

what brush is she using for the setting powder?
LOVEE
Absolutely gorgeous ❤🎉
Yes, there's a concept of a makeup color wheel! It's based on the traditional color wheel used in art, but adapted to help with makeup choices. Here's how it works:  * Primary Colors: Red, yellow, and blue are the foundation.  * Secondary Colors: Mixing two primary colors creates secondary colors: green (blue + yellow), orange (red + yellow), and purple (red + blue).  * Tertiary Colors: Mixing a primary color with a neighboring secondary color creates tertiary colors. How it applies to makeup:  * Complementary Colors: Colors opposite each other on the wheel (like blue and orange) create high contrast and can make features pop.  * Analogous Colors: Colors next to each other on the wheel (like blue, blue-green, and green) create a harmonious and subtle look.  * Triadic Colors: Colors evenly spaced around the wheel (like red, yellow, and blue) create a vibrant and playful look. Using the Makeup Color Wheel:  * Eyeshadow: Choose eyeshadow shades that complement your eye color. For example, if you have blue eyes, orange and brown shades can make them pop.  * Blush: Select blush colors that mimic a natural flush. Consider your skin tone – cooler tones might prefer pink blushes, while warmer tones might look better with peach or coral.  * Lipstick: Experiment with colors that complement your skin tone and the rest of your makeup. Keep in mind:  * Skin Tone: The makeup color wheel is a guide, but it's essential to consider your skin tone (cool, warm, or neutral) when choosing colors.  * Personal Preference: Ultimately, the best colors are the ones you feel confident and beautiful in! Let me know if you'd like more specific advice on using the makeup color wheel for your eye color or skin tone!

I love her personality so much! she's always a genuine person.
her skin is perfect omg
The BodyLava ✔️
The Bronzer ✔️
She has a ac in there
Rihanna's eyes are so beautiful..
Sensacional
Once she called that India is a poor country.... Although now India is in 5th position in economy... The matter is now in 2024 .... Mukesh Ambani gave her 9 million to perform in India in his son's pre wedding.... So think twice before you say anything as you are a public figure... Your words matter.....
Anyone knows which lip gloss is it?
She is smtg else 😭she is so charming & energetic
Wao mam superb
how do you know you are a billionaire "when you bathroom has an AC
She is so beautiful ❤️
The body shimmer is MAGIC - I love what it does and Ri is the first I've seen show it in a makeup routine. Very nice.
Huberman Wife
What's on her arm and wrist ?
Contagious laught
loved this made me laugh too
The fact that she is literally every woman in this video made me feel so not alone!
Love it that she doesn't take herself too seriously ❤
I’ve been watching this video over and over again for years that isn’t normal 😭
Her <<voila >> sound so cute 😊❤️
i don know why i open this video every once a year lol can almost remember every step😂
iloveyouuu🩷🩷🩷
First get rich then comes luxury
She is so original
I didn't like the nose contouring. Trying too hard to fit western standards of beauty. The foundation is also two shades lighter than her natural skin tone. There's a difference between face and neck. But she's fun.

Hi
Is she using her own product? She is beautiful and so lovable.  She acts like an ordinary person, not a billionaire pointing to her flaws.
I swear I’ve watched this 3 times lol
She’s absolutely gorgeous, ohh i can not stop watching this and really every single time I watch this video i fall in love with her voice and move, ouhh this woman is absolutely incredible am obsessed🫦🫦
Definily she's the Bette
Okay Rihanna's personality is a lot more down-to-earth than I would have expected. (I've only ever listened to her music before, not watched interviews and stuff like that.)
I literally love rihanna she's so down to earth ❤
She iissss soooo funny lol! Tbh I got worried at the beginning she looked like an orange! But at the end… so beautiful 🤩
Skincare= love yourself with Shimmer Brick Red Terracotta😘
I love bronzer
But why’d she make herself so yellow? Maybe it was just the lighting..
Rihanna i love you
shes probably the most down to earth super celebrities i've ever seen
Oh boy😂 I need a lot of that under the eye you're great by the way😊
😘😘😘😋😚🫠 Carolina Herra Au Tolette

I don't use makeup at all, but rewatching this video once a ~year just for the mood. Rihanna is a goddess.
She is so beautiful she doesn’t even have to put any makeup on her face facts 👑

You are beautiful! Rihanna 💫
Fenty Beauty has been my absolute favourite makeup product ever ❤
What a coincidence my classmate name is rihanna😂

5:30 I love this part😂
I like how y’all judging people after a 5-10min make up -skin care routine video . Obviously everyone will act nice and friendly especially cause there are people with them and filming 😂. Y’all don’t know them in real life so stop idolising celebrities lol
So beautiful
is it purpose that her makeup shade dont fit with her skin color at all? it looks pretty funny.
hello can i ask do you have a song named: let me be me

On my way a comprar cosas de Fenty beauty

The foundation scared me ngl
Does anyone know the name of this lipgloss? Is it discontinued?
che icona aiutoo
A B C YOU ARE OK...  1 2 3 FOR I TRULY DO CARE ABOUT YOU...
❤🎉♥️🍉🌷👌👍✌
Where is Chris Brown? HE does not like this
Can’t believe this was five years ago already 😭😭
I'm going to buy myself some of Fenty makeup. Just watching you apply seems so easy
😂😂😂😂 B*tches!!! 😂😂 I love her
i just about to go to sleep but i couldn't resist rihanna infront of the screen ahahaha so glad i stopped by to watch this <3
i just love love love how playful she is
"HiiiiIIiIIiIIiI, SHSHSHHSHS" AAHAHAHAH GOT ME LAUGHIN
对于美国的事我非常生气，所以现在不想看到一个美国人
I'm in love with her DEEP voice ❤❤
She’s beautiful 😍
Riri❤️😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩😽 more than perfect
Pretty RiRi
i cant stop laughing about this video! you can see that Rihanna is being Rihanna🥰
Ew that foundation doesn’t even match her skin
I just would like to know the name and the colour of each one is perfect ♥️
😂😂😂😂 i have a huge forehead 👐👐
Asap never miss ..
Yes you can 😂
love that husky voice and love fenty beauty!!
For my whole life I got called mega minds daughter but now that Rihanna can show me she can be just as pretty as everyone else I feel like I can build confidence even though she likes to cover it up it still makes me feel like I can do something about it.
whats the name of that gloss ??????
Im nust seeing this now but i absolutely love it and she looks stunning, and i cant believe she actually used all of her own peoducts to for her actual makeup routine. Ive watched a few people so these and MAYBE use one of their own products for their actual makeip routine and i always thought that was weird. How are we supposed to want to buy your makeup when you dont even wear it yourself lol. But maybe im juat over thinking it lol. Either way Rihanna is gorgeous as always and even without any makeup on :) ❤❤ i hope everyone has a great day and/ or night
Now create a complete package. For the face. Such as a peach face. Pink face etc.
Omg I never realized how yellow her foundation is😭 we knew nothing about undertones huh?
She so beautiful❤
I truly truly love this tutorial excellent and I love Peach warm Peach rustic Peach this tutorial is awesome
she is soo sarcastic wanna have her soooo badlyyy omg crying
I think she is the most charismatic and authentic person I know now a days
not giving the lip details is a lil hatery tbh
So beautiful omg, gourgeus. Love ❤
5 years later I'm realizing everything is a fenty beauty product but we didn't know 😂
Rihanna is very beautiful
shes so cute omg
love her
Please do a pregnant tutorial
Large  forehead.  She is smart n intelligent
She’s so stunninggggggg 🥹🥹🥹✨✨✨🧚🏽‍♀️🧚🏽‍♀️💗💕💘💓💞
I need the highlight, the lipgloss and the body spray. Where I can find it?
❤😂🎉😊
❤❤❤
Rihanna is the ultimate girls girl
BEAUTY SECRETS= BEAUTY EASY SEE ARE EATS! 😋
it’s so reassuring that rihanna also doesn’t have a perfect color match
I miss this kind of vogue videos is so calming and therapeutic if you know what i mean and also we get to see the what famous celebrities are like without being croasing their boundaries. I miss the vibe of this video sm.
Nem uso essas coisas mas olhando assim ate da vontade💝💝💝💝💝💝💝🇩🇪
50 dkg vakolat nélkül az igazi arcával sokkal jobban néz ki.... Ez igy csak kép mutatás.
I can watch her all day!!
Plz she so cute 😞💖 not only her face but her whole vibe here. Love you Robyn
We just need to accept the fact that Rihanna is Gods favorite human being and the rest of us are just here to keep her company 🤷🏾‍♀️
I’m not saying I’m obsessed with Rihanna. But I watched this video 6 times without blinking. But I’m not obsessed.
Love how she sings and put one makeup 💄💄❤ love it
8:33 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT LIP GLOSS? I’ve been trying to find it for so long
Ri, I love you but this makeup just isn't it.(no hate intended)
True me to RI lol . 😂🫶🏽😘love ya girly

You are rich in beauty. A rich lady is yourself.
'Rihanna' means hope in Arabic.
Jaden loves his words. (beauty)
You love your words.❤
Colourism:  Jaden=blue Me=black Rihanna=black Father=red
I am your daughter and Jaden is Father. You guys look alike. Ask myself.  You are made both parents.
Tyla and Ayra have sister problems because of their parents. They appraise fake.  (lesson)
You, Father and Jaden sound touched. (beauty)
I am your Garnier and M.A.C user. (beauty)
I have several doubts. This person has naturally brown/black skin. She uses foundation first then, contour and then bronzer! She conceals her undereyes first then uses a darker color in her undereyes! So wats up with all this... I am a makeup illiterate...
5:47 😂😂😂
She's perfect oh my goshhhhh💓💓💓
Oh it was soooo much fun she is a golden lady🎉🎉🎉
What lipgloss is she using?
Tip for make-up: Be successful.
Tip for beauty: Be natural. You are on my natural Fenty Beauty.
Thank you for using my resource. I am done.
I am Essence and Rimmel London on makeup and Fenty Skin on my real skin. I listened.
You're wearing your childhood makes in Fenty Beauty.  I am wearing my finance investments in my makeup styles.
On skin, you are Fenty Skin.
You're Fenty Beauty. Don't  I just poor in reality. I am super moody.

I absolutely love Rihanna! She’s stunning, funny and  I wish she would have the time to have her own YouTube channel! You go girl! ❤
She’s the most fun human ever
Hey babygirl

Woooah! She ain't really beautiful like the tabloids show. She's a mediocre... All her son's features.
SHES SO CUTEEEE
Well done Rihanna you've just made your "fat" fans feel a whole lot better with your comments. And to think people look up to these so called celebrities....get real ppl...start believing in yourself.
Far too much makeup, which doesn't blend in with her natural skin tone.  Looks more like a mask. She looks far better natural. Awful!!!!!
She’s stunning 😍 love you rihanna
I absolutely love her but frankly I don't think that Foundation shade is perfect for her. However her contouring and highlighting skills are amazing
I ❤️  it!
She is so funny...she needs a YouTube channel .
I love you always Rihanna 💞💞💞 #yourfangirlatphillipinesDAVAOCITY.
Freaking love this girl,  your makeup is 🔥  tha best!!! ❤️❤️❤️

Love this still❤🎉

As nicely shaped as you are, your forehead to me is the best of your curves. It has such an attractive roundness to it, and your skin even without makeup contrasts very nicely with your hair and eyebrows. And I am only saying this in hopes that it will help you think more positively about your natural beauty. Your humility about being honest about your flaws is also something that makes you attractive.
your forehead is perfect Rihanna your so beautiful  but that foundation looks a little orange tho
Girl has the best talking voice. And she is very funny !
This is the funnest Vogue video I’ve ever watched 🥲
Doesn't matter how much makeup she puts on; Rihanna still will always looks like a real ugly dude! LOL
cool
https://youtu.be/bbIoQIiTNQ0 hi guys!!! Learn with me 🤍
I love her makeup line sm!! Love all the glitters and golds
Who’s gonna tell her her foundation shade is way too yellow for her skin tone?
rhianna so beautiful
wats that lip gloss she uses at the end
i like her eye makeup but her blush placement and lipstick are heinous
I just really love Rihanna's personality she's so humble and humorous
Special nose
Hey anyone know the lipgloss she is using at 8:38 ?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Du bist verrückt.😂😂😂😂😂
Rhianna is so pretty and beautiful without her makeup and with her makeup on and she has a beautiful eyes
Double chin?!?! What double chin??

Gorgeous ❤

Which of the following brands do you have a positive opinion of?
Is no one going to mention how the foundation doesnt match her skin tone??? She still looks gorgeous but that foundation was way too light plus it looks like it has more yellow undertones whereas her neck and hands look like they have red undertones
when she first said hi... I was like why are they showing the result at the start of the video! then i realise she's a born beauty!!❤💘
Sublime . Tu es trop belle.
She is so gorgeous.
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE NAME OF THE LIPGLOSS SHE USED???

Beautiful look ❤. These comments are weird tho. Y’all are happy that she didn’t “promote her brand” and or are happy that she announced a “flaw”.  It made you feel better about yourself which is sad. Do and be better 🙏❤️
Her skin color is more beautiful than this yellow foundation
What lip gloss is that?
Sing while  doing make-up
J'adore Riri 😍
Ohhhh d costumes really match her color 😻
She’s so beautiful ❤

Hi sister
I just LOVE Rihanna. One of the most down to earth celebs in Hollywood. Elegant, sweet, kind and talented☺️
çok tatlı mk
To be honest she looked much better before than after..maybe some lipstick eyeliners or whatever it is called would be more than enough...just my opinion
We just gon watch Rihanna put on the wrong foundation..
you're so beautiful and I love you 🥰😭
My family is remembered in Arkansas State.
I love Rihanna.  The end.
Flawless🌹
You know ✓
She is SO charming.
Her original face color/skin tone is so beautiful and warm, something what we all would want. I’m not sure the foundation was the best match, though.
Great information I really enjoyed watching thank you so much 💓
I think people over hype her, cause I admit she's good but not to the point you'd call her goddess 🤷‍♀️
Rih using fat as a synonym of “bad” is not the move tho….of course no one will say anything about it tho…
My favorite tutorial ever ❤️❤️
Sis! Of course u look cute!
0:06 love that 😆
Her: “hide that double chin” Me: okay cool I guess I have a uh I don’t know septuple chin…yup ‘pparently that’s a thing now and I have it
god she painted whole foundation on her face
She owns a  make up brand and she doesnt even know how to choose her foundation shade 🤡
Sis you don’t need make up u r hooooooooooooot
Lol.. bad decisions
Love you Riri😍❤
Her eyeshadow perfectly compliments her lip gloss 💖✨✨
Foundation is so yellow. Btw she has own makeup brand and she don't know her  skin shade.
i can’t be the only one who keeps coming back to this video, right?

That glossssss
I don't even think Rihanna needs makeup; She's beautiful just the way she is
There are two types of Pisces people in this world:  1. Rihanna.  2. Justin Bieber.   Which type are you?
💚💚💚
Rihanna!!  You don't need make up!! You are more beautiful without it.
the fact that women wake up everyday and cover up their true selves with layers and layers, of make up, fake laughs and smiles is sad to me.
gorgeous gorgeous woman
처음에 이미 메이크업 하고나온줄...존나이쁘네
So glad super light under eye died
More is more. Got u, sis ♡
I love the way she talks, not boring, not plastic hehe...she's already beautiful even without make up😊 love u Rihanna🥰
This is so beautiful. I am definitely checking Rhianna Fenty line after seeing this tutorial. I love her energy!
heyy
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
She’s literally the most beautiful woman ever
Is she high?
her face is yellow though
The only epic thing here is a satire  Brazilian video to this one! hilarious is you understand Portuguese!
In my teenage years when my best friend pointed out i have a bigger forehead than them, i got insecured for years, when i watched Rihanna ....her confidence and charm changed my mind I don't have the money right now, but when i will have it I M GONNA BUY HER MAKE UP LINE ❤❤❤ THANK YOU FOR MAKING US BELIEVE IN OURSELVES AND CONFIDENT
I absolutely love her
The silence after the shhh 😆
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7rgnlQRdshllOrOmPd40g
WITHOUT MAKE UP THEY ALL LOOK UGLY. THANK GOD TO MAKE UP
Ryannah can do my make up anytime.  Even though i dont wear it BUT she can .  I will let her.
So pretty🌹🌹🌹
You know, when I see Vogue videos about makeup, I notice a lot of before these great queens but all the products and makeup. It reminds me that even without some kind..
I loved ❤️ es perfecta ...
Diogo Parodiaaaaas 🇧🇷
Rihanna doesn’t even need makeup !
Is beatiful Rihanna 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Es muy fresca y divertida!..siempre pensé  que era pesada..es la primera vez que la  veo y la escucho hablar!
So beautiful
Ice cream : Hello my friend . How r u ? 😊
I love love her face & singing voice !! What a beauty ! But, I can tell that she's a mean girl !! Lol. Her eyes tell me ...,but she is stunning !! The foundation colour choice was miss ,though !! It's too yellow for her !! She's got more pinkish undertone !! Which ,I think rare for black people ? But,she needs to match it with her neck & hands !! Maybe it was only showing that way in this video ? Not sure . I just love her face !! Lol.💜🥁🐉🎤💞
Awww... I wanted to see how she did her eyebrows!! 😭😭😭  I loved what she did with the highlighters, those two colors together looked amazing!!
I love Rihanna so much she’s my idol.
i absolutely love rihanna :)
Idk why she puts on that much foundation her skin is FLAWLESS
Feeling flat…. watch this. She’s hilarious.
❤️❤️
Honestly disorienting how many people are in there helping her record this tutorial, or Fenty ad. Don't get me wrong, I love watching it and I think it's beautiful art period, but still darkly funny how much production it takes to engineer a celebrity's "natural" or "carefree" vibe on camera.
This is a one hour makeup dude
Wish she would have shown how she does her brows. 😏
Concealers are to hide bad decisions🙌🏻
She is orange
She is orange
So like does someone else do her eyebrows???
And she pregnant now🤰❤❤❤
So beautiful inside and out! Goddess!
That lipgloss would of started a cult in 2001 lol
The light touch. I like it
🙋‍♂️🌪
How are you not using your own brushes
Anyone else think her foundation isn’t there right color on her? I mean, she contoured it out really well but I think her contour was closer to her color, just a touch darker. Idc though I still love her and she looks stunning!
Is summer: LOVE, DRAMA, BITCHES!
She’s a Mommy Now!
ÚNICA DE 2022🤔BABY CHEGANDO RIRI🤰🤱❤️

It’s just the beauty for me 💣
what a youthful beauty love ittt
5:47 😭😭😭😂
Is it that she just looks amazing even without makeup or she is already wearing makeup before making up?🤔
Anyone know what highlighter she put in her inner corner
I can't resign to how wrong the undertone to her foundation is against her skin...I just can't get over it.
That foundation.....🍊🍊🍊🍊.........oop
Sou a única brasileira?
Shes so gorgeous.

I just love her ❤️
She's beautiful 🌹
What product did she use in the inner corner of her eyes?
summer 😎 sunset 🌅  love 💕  drama 🎭   BITCHES 😤😤😤
Does anyone know the lipgloss she used?
Her brows are very gorgeous! She doesn’t need to do her brows
Nice wig.
who are you going to see
That little "PAUSE BUTTON" picture taunts me.
"sunset, summer, love, drama, BITCHES"
Me watching her without makeup at the start of the video "Wait she is not wearing makeup!?"
What did she use on her lips?
The foundation doesn’t match her neck
She's so awesome I want her to adopt me
Foundation is great
Just loved there is no dislike in this video ❤️
Rihanna przetumacz na polski nic nie rozumiem co mowisz
loveeeee yooouuuuu sooooo much, girl!
this is so comforting
I'm a guy and I seriously dislike foundation on women. It's too powerful. Too concealing. Like putting on a mask. I rather see you with as little make up as possible. Even if you think you don't look pretty (which nowadays is usually a false perception) then experiencing you taking off that mask and then looking at a completely different person. Just my personal opinion. Also, doesn't all that make up ruin your skin over the years? I'm not sure. You ladies probably can answer this for me.  ps. I also noticed after she was done her face color doesn't match her body skin color. Doesn't look right. This girl is gorgeous. She doesn't need any of this stuff.
shes has nice brown eyes. is that her real eye color? do barbados all have brown eyes? very beautiful.
I get it ri-ri
o my god you neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed to release an eye shadow pallet for fenty
" I have a huge forehead so I need to go deep in " ~ now that's what I call confidence 😘🤞
I would love to see what makeup products she's been using before she had a brand,instead of just promoting her own for 10 minutes.
Better take adele as role model rather than an moron
mitad de la cara es frente🤣🤣
mitad de la cara es frente!!!!
MULHER LINDA SONHO DE VALSA <3
Watching this is like watching a little kid play with makeup and how excited they are with each thing they try.  I don't know how to do a lot with makeup so it's inspiring to watch.

Your material possessions will decay, get rusted and your beautiful skin & perfect body will rot, decompose and become dust and ashes, your extravagant life is so very meaningless... Give your life to King Jesus Christ 👑👑👑 before it is too late, you will realize then the true meaning of eternity... This earthly life is like a vapour, mist, everything is passing away, but your soul will stand in front of the Great Mighty Eternal God Of This Never-ending Universe on the great Judgement Day... Repent and give your short materialistic life to Father Jesus, before it is too late, for tomorrow is not promised to anyone!! King  Jesus👑 Is Coming Very Soon... Robe yourself not with the perishable things of this world but with His Holy Spirit🔥🙏... Peace!
Böyle ölürüm sana olan aşkıma, bulutların güneş ışığında eriyip yok olması gibi.  Maceramızın sonu ne oldu, dinle: Bulutlar gibi geldik ve rüzgarlar gibi geçip gittik.  Yağmura dökülmüş bulut gibiyim. Ne ağlayabildim ne gülebildim. Şu koca dünyada benim bildiğim. Ne yaşaya bildim ne ölebildim.  Ben senin hayatında gökyüzündeki bulutlar olmayacağım. Çünkü onlar bir gelir bir gider. Ben gökyüzü olacağım hep orada duracağım.  İnsan nasıl ki hüzün yumağı gibi sıkıştığı zaman gözlerinde yaşlar boşalıyor, bulut da su damlacıklarıyla dolduğu zaman yağmur olup yağıyor.  Başa gelen sıkıntılar üzüntüler belalar ve musibetler bir bulut gibidir sabır (ümit) rüzgarı esince o bulut kaybolur gider.😘😙🥰 Yes I love İmparator Cemal Good morning How are you Dünya Türkiye Alanya Yes Coffee

Bi kadın ne yapsa yakışır mı yaa daş mübarek,... Bitek şu baş barnağını sevmiyom
Rihanna is a goddess.  Gorgeous without a stitch of makeup.  But her foundation in this was way too yellow for her natural skin tone.  I’m half Mexican & 1/2 Irish.  I struggle to find the right shade too!  If it’s made for white skin, it’s too pink on me.  If it’s made for Hispanic skin, it ends up looking orange on me.  I feel for women who have the same problem.
Just a Queen

Não consigo ver esse vídeo sem me lembrar do Diogo paródias
Her make up tutorial is really trash xD I see so many things done wrong. Her cheek looks like a safety vest, her foundation doesn't match her skin tone, she applies way too much product, the contour is a bit too far down, she looks like she has no clue what she is doing. I like her bubbly and positive attitude tho.
When she said "shushh" that is really rude, like the time she yelled in her concert
I loved this
Her foundation does not match her skin shade
Sistaaaa don't be shy . Drop a bop song gurl. Just drop anything we miss you so much 🥺💚
We love how real and open Rihanna is! She's beautiful both inside and out!
She's such an angel
Thank You. Very very much.

This is my favorite video of Rihanna
Oh my God her skin is soo flawless🤩  I wish I had a skin like her😭
Raise your hands if you think that Rihanna looks better without makeup
Her foundation doesn't match her neck...why on earth would she not formulate a shade that matches her exactly????  If it doesn't match her, what hope do the rest of us brown skinned ladies have????
Her blotting powder is the one I use. I agree - it’s always in my purse. It’s a good one!
Shes just chilling these days working on her brand and getting paid. Bless her. Shes a beauty.
Pretty girl.

Savage reply:If it doesn't fits in my purse,I change my purse
She´s insanely gorgeous but she covers her face with too much stuff that doesn´t enhance her natural beauty. Also, the foundation color doesn´t match her skin, it looks yellow :( ...why change her natural skin color? it´s already beautiful.

KANGANA RANAUT is the best!Rihanna is a fool 🙄
DID SHE FORGET TO PRIMEEE
Rihanna is so fineee 🥺
I actually don't think the foundation shade is actually Riri's exact colour. It's a bit more yellowish but she still looks pretty and blending into neck will make the look more good. (No offence I love her)
Rihanna i would so love for you to style me up as i have no style,im a mum of 4 & dont know what to wear and the makeup is i cant afford it. If you did a show makeovers with RiRi woman who dont have style to sheek in less than a week build up ones confidence and you'll have so many viewing it.
Aww she looks amazing but her choice of foundation was not her shade, her neck looks like a different color! :( Love the eyes and lips!  <3

What sade concealer did she use.?
Do u ever tried Salsa , it is the best Beauty tip 😄😄😄😄
The foundation Rihanna uses is way too orange. I would go for a darker more brown shade instead of a light orange shade for RiRi.

This is not your first time is it,  not second not third
I'm watching this and I'm just thinking about diogo parodia's version
ANYONE PLEASE drop some info on that highlighter brush and lipstick shade
I can't watch Rihanna without remembering Diogo Paródias
Every time she tries to not look fat. It’s not her problem but society has taught us to think this way. I hope today she has overcome this.
Love the way U lies😩😍🐐

Anyone in 2021??

Am I the only one who got a tingling feeling when she got up close to the mic.....no just me ok?
Rihanna 🤩🤩👏👏👏Good Girls Diva
Btw she used a different shade of foundation..? Than her face tone??
Does she even age?
Rihanna has a strongly barbarian accent
the foundation was the wrong shade for her. How does she have a whole makeup brand but can't pick the right shade for her skin tone??
Dönüp dolaşıp bunu izliyorum ama ne dediğini anlamıyorum
This just never gets old tbh
A Barbadian princess
Her voice is so beautiful 😍

I love your malformed head most of all, Rhianna, like a baby that exited the birth canal all wrong, and your ugly henna patterned  tatoos in green ink totally destroying the purpose of yellow henna are simply "wow." You are my idol because you know everything. In fact, I want your head to swell even more with all your accumulated knowledge, you being a worldly womean.

The dislikes are the people who doesn't dislike tori but hates makeup
After watching this, I found Rihanna super adorable as a human being, not just as an artist, her voice is so mellow and satisfying to listen to, I don't normally listen to Western music or watch like western artists do stuff (in general) but she, she's like just adorable and I love her now
my comfort video

sadly the foundation doesn't match her neck perfectly, but I guess that's a problem we all "face" many times.

Makeup by https://youtu.be/E8EwUVu6UMA
No offense but I haaaate it when people dont tie up their hair when doing make-up it just really reeeally annoys me
I’m obsessed with her
For a second at the beginning she looks drunk 😂 I don't like the make up she is using, completely wrong color for her skin tone, it too yellow. Her eyes are BEAUTIFUL

she already had some makeup on...
íconica!
I genuinely feel shes more cooler on her undertones- like the pink is evident :/ she's gorgeous but that's not her shade.. doesn't seem like it on camera at least
‘Perfection’ is the word for her .
Mais alguém veio aqui pra ver se ela vai falar da Franciny Ehlke❤😂
What, what was that foundation... Ahh no
Rihanna, you are so adorable. thank you for sharing with us such a great video. hearing your voice helps release some of my stress. I wish you health and happiness because you totally deserve them.
Lol

Atleast she's not saying it like Kylie "now I am gonna use my Fenty Concealer"
Que labial es? lo quiero yaaaaa!

RIRI
I feel, that Rihanna seems to be a lot more intelligent than beeing a person who makes comercials about make up. That's sort of downgrades her personality - she appears like beeing a silly house wife - sorry to say.
That’s such product waste by rubbing it on your hand :/
👍👍👍
No i look fat 😂😂😂😂
You are a devil woman who humiliates other religions and later pretended that nothing happened. You are apologizing. In fact, you are not worthy of forgiveness, but you are worthy of the curse. I liked you very much.  Because of the color of your body but now I have no respect for you in my heart😡😡😡
She is a woman who can go to any extent for her fame , even by hurting and disrespecting the spiritual and religious values . You Can Never Get your inner satisfaction and peace by doing such cheap things.😠😠😠
Actual queen❤️
Body lava is the best thing ever invented
She really told us the reason behind using concealer eye bags, dark circles, HANGOVER, BAD   DECISIONSSSSSS......👏👏👏

"EU SOU UMA BAIANA, EU SOU UMA BAIANA"
I want very single one of these products
She had brilliant sense of humour
"Everyone knows concealer is for hiding hangover or bad decisions" I've never felt so related to anything
Hola me gusta como tr arreglas pero ayudame a combinar mis sombras
Rihanna love you
Oh my god her eyes are so beautifulllll
5:47 LMAO
Can we all just appreciate Riri's cuteness 🥺
Of course this hot chick is a Pisces!  Fun, flirty and uplifting.
Man she is gorgeous🦋

“VOILAAH” - Rihanna, 2020

Жаль,что нет субтитров на русском
Trump'a benzedin canım benim ❤️

RiRi is my makeup guru for women just my size. Way to go! 💯👏🔥
Rihanna’s like the cool aunt but an actual cool aunt
I feel like she is good for my mental health, I just love her so much  <3
La amol❤
Best tutorial I’ve ever watched. RiRi is the best no doubt. No man deserves her she’s way too perfect
sup sis won't apologize?
Hi Rihanna ;)
fun fact: this is not your first time watching this
She's so sweeeetttt......
Perfect! She is gorgeous
So real and honest!   Love it!
I think you might not be correct about the peaches. It doesn't say B*%^$hs. You look very elegant
I think you also look good with out your make up. you shouldn't be so shy about your looks.
Soooooooo beautiful soooooooo sweet.. Makeup is also an art.. It needs lots of patience and regular practice to deliver such an outstanding beauty.. Lots of appreciation for uploading such an outstanding video.. U r an outstanding artist. Keep it up.. God bless u.
Rihana is Rihana.
Gorgeous!! I took notes to use some techniques, I am pretty basic when it comes to make up.
Ki ji.
Her Foundation shade is Little bit to light for her Face,her Body is 2 Shades darker or Not?
Omg she's most beautiful woman ever
AOC / Beauty Secrets / Vogue?
I keep coming back
I love the Diamond song
1:57 doesn’t this feel weird to anyone else? Like for someone who the owner of an inclusive brand for all body types and then to mention how she has to contour for her “fat days”¿ Feels like she’s perpetuating that “need to be skinny to be pretty” concept....
She’s such a mood.
I love riri smile
Ficou lindaaa
She really doesn't  need makeup she's soo pretty naturally
Could anyone tell me the name or brand of the lipgloss she is wearing?
I can’t remember how many times I came back here already 😂
CARAMBA!!!!! ESSA MULHER É SIMPLESMENTE UMA DEUSA

Did anyone see how she got on her eyelashes, or did I get a blackout...? 8:27 (I bet it was her biggest secret she did not want to share...)
Es que hay que quererte.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Peoples please tell me what she put on her body?
summer, sunset, love, drama, BITCHES. Love her 😭
I hope Rihanna becomes a barbados Prime Minister
can we just talk about how BEAUTIFUL this woman is before she even applied her makeup?! She applied her makeup soooo gorgeously too, like she was glowing. My goodness she's stunning
She is the finest person
I love her energy ahH
Yellow face
Riri is the best 💜💯👌😍
I love Riri so much. But her foundation didn't match at all with her face. It made her looked really yellow.
i can't believe she is the creator of fenty beauty and she uses that shade of foundation....      but i still love her lol
Hiii shhhh hiii❤❤❤❤

U know why beyonce and rihanna became so famous, successful and powerful?Because, they didn't make their "blackness", a personality trait.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Did anyone notice the air condition in the bathroom?!
Nobody's talking about his Foundation, which is absolutely not his hue?
Awesome video #Vogue. Because of your help I use this skincare brand of products now. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L1F139G/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_GtFAFbCQ8FH1Q
QUEEN
this woman is so funny, I love her so much, a truly independent and beautiful love, every woman's dream continues like this my beautiful 👏😎
Actually spent near 100.00 on some of Your product,but they still do not have. Skin wash.moisturizer,combo yet...realky wanted that.
I enjoy watching your way of contouring,concealing, she of application,and especially the Lips.my favorite....Rihanns
OmG I love the fact how her foundation is no where close to her color
She’s so beautiful 😍
I want RiRi to do mine.😍😍😍
her forehead is so cute it makes her look so young
Why is she using such an orange shade for foundation?! It doesn't match her skin tone at all and it comes out so uneven when you see her neck in a completely different shade, I don't know about you guys but I like my foundation to match my skin tone so it doesn't look like you're wearing it, and what "double chin" is she hiding? I guess we all have our preferences. I didn't like that makeup look at all but then again I'm not her, I do looove that body shimmer though!!
someone plz tell. me this lipgross name
Riahna is so Byuteyful
Her foundation is so yellow, it doesn't match her skin at all.
I brought her book! It’s amazing <3
her eyes is literally the most beautiful thing
Rihanna: cause everybody has a different face my mind: everybody makes mistakes **hannah montana intensifies**
Is she bleaching or tattoos are slowly fading off of her? beautifully made woman
Why is she such a queen UGH luv her ❤️
I am in love with her
She is a vibe😘
I'm in love with her skin tone😍
Just, why am I smiling? (:
At 9:12 I was done. Aww Ri-Ri, you crazy girl. Lol
So you can do makeup in 10 mins
I Like How She Says contour Also I Like Rhianna’s Eyes💚 Color of Rhianna’s Eyes 👀 :Green
I love her
8:37 what is product?
I wish I knew what lipgloss she used 😑😩😩
ファンデの色よか元々の肌の色の方が色味綺麗じゃなかった？って思ってもうた。
왜 노란색 파운데이션을 바르는지 아시는 분...?
I look  good  🤩🤩🥰🥰😊😊😍😍
Maravilhosa! ❤
I love how she’s so natural, it feels like she’s talking to a friend

I thought she did wearing makeup at very first screen. She is naturally beautiful.
Concealer is really meant to hide bad decisions lol
Rihanna saying  ' I'm kinda cute!  '  in the mirror is my vibe ❤️
كم عربي يوجد هنا
i came here again bc riri is so beautiful and cuteeee:(
finally someone in show business with personality and character! how refreshing! she is not afraid of being herself, saying spontaneously what she thinks all that whilst being funny, warm and down to earth.
This video should be n top most popular Vogue's video!!!!
She's a mogul, and she did it all with a real face, real body, real personality. I mean she's the love my life
9:03 VALLA    iç sesim susmuyor🤦🏾‍♂️

So much make up and she looks so beautifull with natural colour face amazing to see this  ... you are beautiful natural stop so much make up...
When you have a big forehead it feels like10 hours😀😀
Just one question the should be asked, why are you wearing makeup? I mean you're already perfect!
Maquiagem para ir para a padaria pq todo mundo sabe que ela quer PÃO
Hay mucho de magia humana en su existencia por el bien que  inspiras.Asciendo lentamente por la colina de tus descubrimientos  viajando de tus ojos como un ente al que lo definen tus anhelos para  dejarte allí una sencilla huella de amor, de ser así queda en sus manos  en su interpretación, inmensamente agradecido y eternamente tuyo
She is soooo beautiful and perfect I just love her❤
All I want to say is...............GOD I LOVE HER!
She is so beautiful ♡♡♥
What lipglos is this?

I didn't realise how funny Rihanna was
*RiRi* fait partie des femmes les plus belles sans Make-up

After reading the comments I love the one comment  Rhianna being in a good mood for 10 minutes

😘🥰 am so serious this women is beautiful and seem so vibrant  huge fan!!!
I love riri. I always come back watching this. But I want to se BEYONCÉ TOO 😭😘💕
For those saying that her foundation looks too yellow it does but I honestly believe that it's the lighting. On her other videos the foundation blends very well with the rest of her skin.
Hi... shh... hiGh
You are mour beautiful on natural
Queen
Background track is good. What is that ?
Love you Riri🌏🥺
I can watch her all day. Riri you so pretty 😭💕

very tastefull  bathroom
rihanna and i have the same skin tone

She should have put foundation on her neck too
I would ways wonder why people love her, because I wasnt interested in her. But this video, I now know that she is a goddess. BRO THE CONFIDENCE INSIDE OF THAT GORGEOUS WOMAN. AM I IN LOVE?
“You know what I’m saying” I love that she says that coz I say it myself all the time as well hahah
She's so funny hahahaa
I started contouring and my nose looks smaller!    thanks!!!   MyListLeverage[dot][com]/vsl2/MakeMoneywithjay
My attention has been on the design of the house(:
So black
she's so professional
💗💗💗💗💗
I am a man and I came across your video by chance.  I really enjoyed the frank talk-through so I ended up watching the whole thing :)
اشكلي العربيه الوحيده هنا😂
I JUST LOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEE YOUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!
Perfect
I mean... I’d give anything to marry this woman😐 She’s unreal, the personality I need in every single person ❤️
Vim aqui só pelo Diogo Parodias
I really hate her for no  reason
I wish it didn't end
Love you Rihanna ♥️
This video is therapeutic ❤️
Highlighter of my life is like a fenty beauty kit 💕
Riri has beautiful eyes 😭❤️❤️
she’s like the cool upperclassman in high school who takes you under her wing and teaches you makeup i love it
I love that lipgloss. What is the the brand and the other makeup that was used. I love everything that she used, she looks flawless.
Robyn Fenty.....I 💚 you!!
Such an inspiration to me
N consigo mais ver sem lembrar o Diogo paródias
So pretty
10:04 "It's glorious, look at it." *Wink* LMBOOOOOOOOO - I wasn't ready! Priceless
She is so Cute <3
This was iconic !!!!!!!
Love her but that foundation is really not her shade
She is sooo pretty😊😇
her eyes are really beautiful just like her. <3
I don't think I would stop laughing if Rihanna was my friend--she's ADORABLE!
Rihana is the type of friend that anyone will love to have, she so beautiful, creative, funny, and friendly , I love her for that.
Rihanna is like a big sister to her fans
Anyone else thought her foundation choice was a little off? I mean Rihanna is not THAT yellow... Lol
Um did no one catch the comment she made about having a "black nose"....🤔 Was she trying to say she feels ashamed of it?? I actually really hate this idea about contouring the nose, why do black women feel so inclined to fall for this self hating trap??? 🤨 I would never do that.
OMG please... double chin lol .... you don't have a double chin
What did she use as inner corner highlight?
I would love to meet her
Самый лучший макияж, который мне довелось наблюдать когда-либо ! Спасибо)
Her voice awww
She is so insanely gorgeous and has the best pets. It’s not fair to the rest of us 😆
More videos putting on makeup:(
Sold vouge magazine @ store. Many talented articles thanks
Thank you for making me your KiNG... SuGaR! I love you, HoNey. Congratulationz on your successful career... Piece.
10 minute going out makeup  Me: laughs in bad skin. Its ppl with already perfect skin that can get away with with short routines. My concealer alone needs 10 minutes to set. I try but large pores and hirsutism spots,scars and ingrown hairs won't let me be great.
Little bit catastrophic. Her faith is much orange
im watching this for the third time
I love her so much she is my queen 😍 but I feel like her face is too orange for her 🥺
She already has a make up at the beginning .
She's so refreshing to watch❤. I mean its like she's doing this video without a audience😅💯💪
Love love love your energy 😍
She looks even more pretty without make up like seriously
that's a very special nose😂
WHY THIS VIDEO IS TOO ICONIC?
Wow Riri product is nice
I didn’t know that a makeup tutorial can be this much entertaining! She’s a real queen! 👑
She is amazing
i can watch her do this forever
Listen to Cardi b and Megan thee staillon WAP song there is Kylie Jenner and it is very cool song
Just think if Rihanna had a daughter,teaching her how to do makeup. We Stan 🤭😘✨
#barbadosforever🇧🇧❤❤❤
POINT BLANK PERIOD THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY👌🏽
Soy la única que la ve amarilla?

She is SO sweet and adorable. She’s always such royalty. Her I feel so at ease with her like she would be so friendly and easy to have fun with.
Rihanna. I love you! But could you please stop using the word, "Savage". It is a racial stereotype derogatory word for Native Americans. I'm Native and proud but please stop using this word. Thank you.

8:54 5 year old girls trying out their mom's lipstick
I can’t believe Rihanna and I are both Pisces. I’m so awk and quiet and she’s so outgoing and just the best.
I LOVE HER😭
I don't even like makeup but Robyn's energy got me coming back to this video everytime... Just to take a shot of her soft greatness
Rihanna: h- Me:💓❣️✨🌸🏵️💐🌸🌺🌈💐💖💐🏵️🌺💖💖💞💖🏵️💖🌺💞🏵️💐🌈🏵️💖💞
😍😍😍😍
but she didnt even blend the foundation to her neck and now they both look different.
Who wants 73 questions with the 73 questions guy?

I aspire to be like her

I like it when she's smiling
Ok Rihanna is wayyyyy more funnier than I thought
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT HER HIGHLIGHT????????
she really is the most beautiful person i’ve ever seen. hands down
We stan a girl who isn't afraid to admit her double chin
She know how to make joke 🤣
Why is no nobody talking about her foundation shade 😂
👏😍
She's queen
"More is more"
Let's be honest here. This isn't the first time you're watching this.
Can I spend just one single day as Riri? Plsssss
I must not be the only one who has come here to see her more than once!
😍
2 years later and I still don't know what lipgloss that was
Still the best vogue make up tutorial on youtube.
Thé reason I prefer Rihanna over Beyoncé is because Rihanna is actually close to people, she doesn’t try to make herself seems as an   unreachable person or like non human kind of legend idk if you understand, she’s really real she’s a legend naturally Beyoncé is completely unrelated tbh
Such as super-model, super-human, super-wonderful!!!!!!!
I already watched this video before!!!!.............. Before making you up, you were so precious,, but after making you up, you look so perfect!!!!!
Follow globeofsounds on Instagram 😀
I need that gloss she used!! I don’t see anything that looks like it on the Fenty website 😩 does anyone know what gloss that is??
shes soooooooo beautiful
Those magnificent eyes would not let anybody to search any not-goodee!!!part of you
What product does she use in her inner corners?
So pretty❤
hi rihanna ilove u,i used pink mekeup and  your skin
They've so much spots on the faces however they cover up with a huge make-up which is very awesome
OMG she speak french cause she saying « voilà » and I´m french so 😂🖤
I cant believe shes 32! She looks 20
Such a mood  ICONIC
I thought yellow?  Yet you blended in the foundation and it looks great!
Her nose is pretty
I actually like her natural skin tone more. It is really pretty. That foundation make her look too yellow

I thing before you makaup you makaup now you are so beautiful😍😍
É estranho ouvir essa voz da Rihanna depois de ver as paródias do Diogo paródias
One question does she wear a wig? I'm sorry I dont know ANYTHING
This is probably my 7th video of watching Vogue makeup videos ( I have a problem, don’t judge)  and I just love how they mostly talk about like acne, or weight gain or anything like that. It shows you that they’re not as perfect as you think they are
Oh god I love her so much
Girl I just came on the video and Rihanna called herself fat! She’s beautiful no way!!
crazy  lovely girl <3
She looks gorgeous before and after the makeup!  I love all the glitter, but microplastics are bad news. :(  Maybe she can figure get her people to create something with different ingredients!
Make up is fun. It is to play with. GOLD
Love you Rihanna visit below https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxbbYPwB1Ok

How to make ones hate themselves in 10 mins
Só consigo ouvir a voz do Diogo Paródias
I love how down to earth and confident she is without coming off as arrogant. Not too many celebrities like that.
Good tutorial, I wish she said the names of the products
She can seriously pull anything off!!
Wow nice😍😍😘😘
She’s Soooo beautiful and a vibe 😩🔥🔥🔥
I am surprised how natural she still looks even after applying all that gold stuff. But to be honest: if I had such a beautiful, glowing and pure skin like her I would never ever smear any make-up on it. Gosh am I envious ^^
IM SORRY BUT HER NATURAL LIP COLOUR
😗😗😗😗♑♐♋
her laugh can cure corona virus 😂
This is my favorite 10min guide video EVER!
So we it gon talk about how high she is, cause I’m here for it 😌
More make up tutorials any Rihanna is needed!!!!!!!
Smile on your face🙂
She has the best personality
"because it says summer...sunset...love...drama...BITCHES!" what a smooth transition
I didn't know about the huge forehead until now lol
Queeeenn
Her foundation is just not the shade but I luv her
BIHTCHESSS
"We going to the the clurbbb"
I love you riri, im make up artist in argentina and i love everything kind you doing in this video

Wow she's such a glitter queen ....she literally gave me the inspiration to play with glitters someday when I start playin wid makeup 😌
I am not a vogue fan .i just saw rihanna and clicked the video😂
She don't f*** with her people enough. Most of the time, I see her, she always with a group of Becky's or sextape swirling.
I have never seen such beauty
I love you Rihanna 😍😍😍
I love vogue
Love this..the music at the begining ..her genuine bloopers like ‘no i look fat’ 😭..her makeup advice..shes also has great humour..and so chilled! never seen this side to her! So perfect 😍😫
I love her so much. Rich or not, she’s got the sweetest soul. And she’s beautiful! ❤️ God bless her.
i dont get why people hate rihanna, like really
Love you riri

I thought she had makeup on already in the beginning of the video omgg she is naturally stunning
Love me so Riri, but can someone please tell her to put her foundation on her neck too

The girl is wholesome
Uglyei Twinss

😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Crazyyyy Transformation 🥰
She's confident coz she's RIHANNA
So much fun🌻
She sounds like a cool person to hang out with.
Rihanna  is fun
It really look like she only put on blush/highlight & eyeshadow plus her skin was looking good before she put on foundation ✨ must be nice to do both
i wish i had her skintone, i’m so pale lmfaoo
I really liked that she mentioned that everyone should contour their face according to THEIR FACE
So relaxing watching she videoing this lol
I love this makeup
I am your biggest fan
“Summer, sunset, love, drama, bitches” as an eyeshadow palette please 🥺
0.2 seconds in Riri: nah I look fat🤣💀
‪ Just for girl. Men keep back!!!!!‬ Definitely i recommend ••> ‪https://amzn.to/3iZXA2d‬
Rihanna is SO beautiful. I hadn’t realized how heavy her brow bone is. She makes me what to wear make up.
Hey guys, sorry for disturbing. Just wanna tell that I'm new here and I'm trying to promote my channel, hope we can support eachother! Thank u💜
This is just amaze!!❤❤🙌
"Blend is Real" - I really love the way she said that.. 😄
She need to learn to match makeup but she Georges!!!
I’m hopping she moisturized before applying foundation 😨
she is so unproblematic and REAL :)
My dad saw you at the airport but i was not born my mom told me that
Her skin is perfect omg
Why does she use make up in the first place? She looks so beautiful without. Her skin tone is gorgeous! And then she puts on the yellow stuff? Looks weird to me... she is just a natural beauty.
her voice is so soothing :)
I got so disappointed when she started with her makeup, she looked so pretty without any of that
See that? Ahhh
Loved this 🤣

She made me feel so beautiful. When she said " I learned how to contour when I gained weight." 😂 I love you girl!
riri you're sooo beautiful I love u 💗😻
Она очень красивая девушка 🌺
she is so gorgeous
What's the name of the lip gloss she wore?
Her foundation looks orange and doesn’t match her neck. Looks bad. The contour stick doesn’t look well made, Too light. Lol
I love you!!! You are too funny! I was surprised to see a clip of you doing make up. Love it! I am very simple too with make up.
Rihanna is so cute and funny and lively and gorgeous, I don't even see the need for her to wear makeup because she's gorgeous with and without it. And the fact she knows she is not perfect makes her all the more perfect
esse vídeo eh perfeito
how excited she gets about makeup gives me life 😍
She is inspiring me to do my makeup and it's like 1 in the morning
Camilla is my time for you and you I have to go to the gym
I loveeee this woman!
Bronzer and contour seems the same to me, the only difference I see is that you spend more time and money, because you got to buy and put two products instead of one.

I am in love with this woman

Rihanna is not a US citizen, she's a alien.
Is it me or she gets beautiful every time 😍😘😍😘😍
I hate makeup videos but i watched this just because of her.
She's not that pretty, like I like her but I don't get why people act like she's absolutely drop dead gorgeous  and she's not funny ?
i watched this video like 22 times in these 2 years
my queen..... forever beautiful.... I love you
Love you Rihanna😘
Ice cream : Hi friend ! How r u ? You look great ! Have a good day  ! Take care !! See u next time ! 😁

dragging ALLLL  the make up gurus!!!!!!!
wow i love her
She has one of the most beautiful genuine smile
She's the best!! NAVY FOR LIFE! ❤
We seriously don’t deserve her! 😭🖤
Can definitely tell the actual consideration behind the products of fenty and its quality through the hype energy in this for reals ⚡😍
Love, sunsets ,drama, BITCHES🤣🤣😆 yo I’m weak.

Please Vogue do what you do idk but I want some more !! Call Rihanna please, I miss her can’t believe it’s been already 2 years I can watch this video all the day
Girls with big foreheads are pretty 😍😍😍 Is you agree with me 🙋🙋🙋
Hi everyone I just posted a haul video on my channel
We all know why she doesn’t trust anybody about her eyebrows
Rihanna is so awesome
Best makeup tutorial of all time ❤️
And now we know that creating make up was in her blood.  She actually was doing it long before Fenty Beauty...DIY... She obviously inspired herself... it’s always good to understand the inspiration behind something new... proud of you homey. You make us in Barbados 🇧🇧 proud.
Alguém aqui viu a redublagem desse vídeo no Diego paródias? 😂😂
Why does her face look different compared to her neck?
In awe.
I love how she's naturally beautiful with natural glam unlike other celebrities
Whats going kyliee ?
So gorgeous🥰
step 1: be rihanna
So useless !
I didn’t watch this video for make up I just watched this video to see the queen.
No one is going to talk about that she didn't touched her eyebrows?
Ohh i love Rihanna;(❤️

Riri is the type of friend we all want. She’s gorgeous, funny, and relatable. Love ya queen!
She is perfect.Sooo pretty and elegant
Ice cream : Hi ! friend , How is everything ? Keep in touch . Fighting ! ! 😃
She doesn’t promote her products, cause she confidently know how great it  We stun a queen 👸
Never knew she's this cute before and she's sooo pretty omg  .... But it triggers me so much that her foundation doesn't match 😂
that foundation color doesn't sit well, maybe its the lighting?
I love her! She’s hilarious!
9:09 lol
YELLOW FACE WTF?
She's so amazing and gorgeous 😍  It's fun to watch her 🙃
I love it so so much😜
Love this girl so much.
Repent Jesus is coming soon! Save your life

Youtube: shows a vid of rihanna's makeup tutorial Me on the first 2 seconds: I thought she was already wearin makeup???
She didnt even do too much she’s just so pretty and beautiful naturally 🥺😍😍😍😍😍🦚
rihanna can literally step on me and slap me and i wont even be mad
im crying even without makeup she looks so beautiful why 😭
That foundation she used has a yellow undertone but Rihanna has a pink undertone.
Yess Riri give us all the juice
Still waiting for 73 questions with Rihanna
Transgender
Is she hideous without makeup?
rihanna, twirling into the shot like a goddess: no, i look fat  me and my double chin: 👁👄👁
WOW she is really pretty..shame she isn't more demure.
👁️Lava U😘
Her eyes 🥺
maravilhooooosa
She gave us better make up advice than most beauty guru's on yt.
We got cheated on the brows! I wanna knowwwwwwww
all the artists always look mean in their music but then Rihanna is just ... perfect and herself
Her skin color is not really dark
her face color doesn't fit her body lol
Me - Watches Rihanna's video Me - (mins later) Watches Kylie's video Me - "Shiet, i need to switch back to the queen's video and see a wholesome content"
Felt like she's so relatable,.. easiest makeup tips
what about that?
kull
so iconic
amazing rihanna!!
I just love how she laughs.
best foundation evar! just this i use since i descover it! good job!!!!
HOW CAN SHE DID HER MAKE UP IN ONLY 10 MINUTES AND LOOK SO STUNNING
We STANNNN
sis you don't need em
She’s the type of friend who would hype you up when you’re feeling down
This is my moon in pisces
When she said BITCHESSSS😂😂
She rocks but the foundation she chose made her skin look yellow at the beginning, a different tone of the rest of the skin. Shouldn't that be even?
1. No moisturizer 2. Foundation doesn't match her skin color 3. Already wears lipstick before her Makeup guide  Who are you kidding Rihanna?
You have left her go
Your friend Tiffany young     Jeffrey tiffly she is white
she's so beautiful 💖😭

She is a perfect barbie
My girl RiRi <3
Girls who have low self esteem needs all type of eye liner, lashes gkitters, asian paints latex and what not.
She hardly needs that make-up, her skin is so fresh!

I don't even do makeup, why am I here? and why am I so into it?
❤❤❤❤💋💋💋💋
I’m a straight male but I bought all of Rihanna’s make-up just to learn to do make-up like in this tutorial.
This makeup look is awful, and only Rihanna can pull this off.
Im about buy the whole fenty set lol that lipgloss and highlighter!!!
RIRI BABEY💚😍
Now I just need to know how her hair is so perfect?? Mine is literally so bleh looking and her hair is my goal
I want this lip gloss!!!!! What is it called?
I love Rihanna 🥺

Meu Deus,eu não consigo ver esse vídeo e não associar  voz dela com a do Diogo paródias

Her shoulder here is a cultural reset

The saying of the year: " More is more"

Wonder If she still worships the devil
Am I the only one who thinks she’s drunk 😳
Rihanna face expressions are so cute 🥺🖤
I need the name of the lipgloss she used, if anyone can help that’d be great.
Move to Egypt 🇪🇬!!! Illuminati 666!!!$$$$$
It’s nice to see a real girl putting on makeup 💄
I absolutely love Rihanna. But her foundation looks too yellow for her :(
визажисты сейчас смотрят на цвет лица и шеи (груди)и плачут..
When you love makeup you enjoy putting it on and you have to take your time for things you enjoy. That's my opinion on "taking like forever for my makeup" ❤️ I adore her and I can't wait till I can afford buying Fenty Beauty to finally do my Fenty Face like hers  ❤️
🥰🥰🥰
Does anyone know the lip shade that she used?
I love her sm
Your head is like a rugby hahaha !!
.... and!....
She looks prettier without makeup.
💋👍
Does any body knows what is the name of the lipstick????? PLS HELP
Like go of pink Floyd ! Females their males in martyer dume! ville trust me apartly 320 years through this white people did. Like Jessie was hot to me but to his own indian , just jokinh LOL!
She looks like my sister somehow is this the same rihanna and so does monta zuma like like Floyd facial!
This one is my favorite the realist one i have seen

Better title: Rihanna being a mood for 10 mins straight
,😂😂😂😂😂😂 femme soufre  avec beaucoup de peinture sur le visage
No one: Me: Not even my mom: YouTube: *do you want to watch 2 years old video?*
im not big on makeup im here for Rihanna
is only me realize that her face turn to yellow?
Her foundation doesn't match her skin
Oop I think there was something in Riri’s hair
Fantomas
All that foundation makes her look orange!
Without makeup she looks much better
Omg gurl I love you Rhi-Rhi😘” where we goin tonight “😋😘
You are fun! Watching you makes me wanna learn different ways of applying makeup on my face :)
Shes literally a Queen
Why she didnt show how she put a wig??
her face and skin colour looking different in the end of her makeup
i loved it
Is it me or does her foundation look yellow orange? Not a good match lol
I just cant believe she used to crush her eyeshadow and use oil make bodyshimmer and all that because thats what i do , haha i am sixteen and i do that sort of stuff !
Knowing there’s people in the room with her is such a turnoff
Why? How? Seriously how she can be so pretty????😍😍
"We all know concealer is used to..... hide bad decisions." OOP
Her face when she pumps the body lava and it doesn't come out 😂
She’s so adorable ♥️
If I had skin like her I wouldn’t bother for make-up
She is the only human on the planet who doesn't need make up AT ALL.
Nous les hommes sans aucun article sortie du ventre de nos mères somme plus beaux que les femmes de vrais apollon.!!
Rihanna ia on drugs in this video. But who would do this sober anyways.
she is so fun to watch. no wonder her make up sells so well !
So pretty and cute! I've never seen her like that, so cheerful. Isn't she?
you're making me hard
Rhianna is never growing old. She's so beautiful 😍
Sana aşiğim be kadin
0:08 best intro ever
Шыкарно выгледишь шыкаладка
Her makeup is awesome but like wow without makeup she is literally PERFECT WTF
what kind of highlighter you use to hide your bags because I have big noticeable bags under my eyes and my highlighter will clear the dark circles but my bags will be more noticeable than ever when I put on the highlighter,🤔🧐🙄💀 I guess it's the off-brand BS 😂😆🤣
Блин у неё кожа с розовым подтоном, а тоналка с оливковым, и даже не смотря на него она выглядит вау
Honestly love how she hypes herself up at the end. Shes so cute <3
don't tell me that she has an air conditioner in her washroom
She is an extraordinary beauty.
RHI RHI SAID" I HAVE A HUGE 4HEAD SO I LIKE TO BRING THE PEN DEEP DOWN ALITTLE BIT"😭😂 "YOU KNOW WHAT IM SAYING" RHI RHI YOU HAVE ME CRACKING UP RIGHT NOW SO HARD MY TUMMY HURTS. I LOVE YOU RHI RHI YOUR SO HONEST AND FULL OF FUN WHEN YOUR DOING YOUR MAKE UP 👌 I REALLY ENJOYED THIS!

Dis girl is a beauty queen with a diamond clear heart I swear-   I luv u Rihanna
Rihanna I need to ask you a question about my brother Aaron Hernandez 81 this is his brother James Stacey Robinson Hernandez Dallas Cowboyz. One-on-one with nobody don't have to know. You don't need no makeup that's my opinion.
Drake and Rihanna need to be back to be back together again.
She's cute :>
😀
The girl is just beautiful plain and simple!!💋
love aqewy vxlgs mciyw hgot seriy wti
What double chin ???
She don't need makeup She's pretty already 🤗
Everyone realizes that when she put foundation on her face became a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHADE RIGHT?!?!??!! Just me????
She looks so beautiful! But her concealer is too yellow...
i really don't like that tattoo eww
She’s doesn’t need makeup don’t even argue with me 😍😍😍
She didn’t even need makeup SHE’S NATURALLY GORGEOUS 😍😍😍🤩🤩
Nice job. Beautiful
You have a make up line with 50 shades of foundation and still you cant find your match..... disturbing

Sou A Unica Q Veio Pelo Diogo Paródias? kakakakaka
shes cute tho
So fun to watch and listen to. Beautifully done
love you ri😘😘😘
i feel like she does NOT give two flying fluffs about what anyone says about her and she just has so much confidence and she doesn’t hide anything and always out with her “flaws” which she doesn’t even have. BUT SHE IS AS REAL AS IT GETS .
Although I don't really like putting on makeup, hehe it's very entertaining to watch makeup tutorials.  I also greatly admire Rihana for what she accomplished in the makeup industry.  I have a very cool idea that they share the way that she and other famous women give us advice about makeup.  Plus I really like Vogue magazine it's fabulous.
I’m disappointed with “no, I look fat” and all of her stupid comments about weight. It’s not relatable or cute it’s fat-phobic and sad. :(
She would be such an awesome mom
Hey, if interested I am also trying to grow my instagram. It's @nav.bby or www.instagram.com/nav.bby.  It would help a lot. I am currently working on a few content ideas to bring to my page soon! If you're not interested, that's okay. Thanks!
Someone get her to do asmr. I would watch that
5:47 she killed me here lol
Does anyone else think she looks fine without makeup?
her face is SOOOOO ORANGE after the foundation it always makes me uncomfortable to watch. i want to wipe her foundation off
Rihanna is a mood in this video
Rhianna: ...and my double chin... Me: where? ⁉️😕
Her forehead
does anyone know what is the lip gloss she used? 😍
She just gorgeous
SHE'S WEARING LIGHT MAKEUP SO NO SHE IS NOT REAL SO STOP SAYING THAT!!!
Love her
0:06 me too
HI

Now this was a cultural reset
Looking back at this video now, sis was probably wearing caramel cutie bronzer! Lol
Am I the only one to think she looks better without makeup??
DID SHE JUST SAY HIDE THAT DOUBLE CHIN??!!! THEN I MUST BE ABSOLUTELY UGLY
pourquoi il mette pas des sous titre français vogue de base est français
What lip stick/gloss did she useeee
michael b jordan with RIHANNAAA?!! •
That is mmwa

Who is here after kylie jenner's video?
Ohhh she said « voila » 🤩 french
“no i look fat” ahahha felt that
queen
deadass thought she already had makeup on at the start of the video
She talked about her weight, her double chin, her forehead and then some. Girl is as REAL as it gets.
Omg I love Rihanna
does anyone know what foundation she used
alquilen que hable español?
Rihanna literally needs her own YouTube Channel.  She’s so funny, and also entertaining to watch.
She's the makeup expert!
that skin are amazing
"No, I look fat"  All I needed to hear to love her even more😤💅🏾
If beauty was a person ❣️❣️❣️🌹
8:41 THIS IS WHY I LOVE HER
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL AND CONFIDENCE 😭♥️♥️♥️
I love how she loves her flaws and everything, I'm not even sure if she has those 'flaws', cuz Rihanna is just so iconic. A queen. Ohmy!
that background music reminds of pamela reif workouts
I Love her lips
I love her so much.
Look at the way she put highlight similar with me when i went "I'm gonna put just a little of highlight today!" and boom ladies and gentlemen I'm your shinning star for today
I so agree!!!!! I only learned to contour once I got fat! Hide that double chin...
She's totally relatable and hilarious! Best makeup video by Vogue so far!
I wanna see a Rihanna skin care !!!
OMG, I love RiRi so much. I am stealing her line --- "Everybody knows that concealer is made to hide bags, dark circles, hangovers, and bad decisions"  La QUEEN!
'because it says,  summer,  sunset love drama BITCHES' -Rhianna
Without  makeup , you look pretty
I love Rihanna
i really enjoy watching this again and again in time because she is gorgeous
She's such a ray of sunshine. Look at her! Gorgeous!
"I'm gonna start with pink on the lids because it says summer... sunset... love... drama...BITCHES."   i love her asdjaskdka
Omg rihanna is iconic
I love how she only used fenty beauty
i just realized how goofy she is
I heard someone commented that she's doing makeup in her kitchen. And I'm like: No honey, *that's* just her bathroom
I NEED A COLLAB WITH NICKI MINAJ AND RIHANNA!!!
Didnt know Rihanna also likes a subtle look
Hello beautiful ones!  I’ve recently made a VOGUE inspired filter! I’ll be making many more and am currently have a contest! Use it up and tag me to enter! I hope you love it !    https://www.instagram.com/fijiwaterdrop/

Elle est vraiment nature Rihanna,elle s'en tape,elle se montre telle qu'elle est...Pure beauty!
She is a MoOd al the TiMe
I refuse to believe she is human
Best Vogue Guide Video
can she save some pretty for me
9:14-9:16 Me waiting for Quarantine to be over, so I can go ape-shyt in the mall! lol
Are you high RiRi? and how much did you smoke? #weedvibes
So you are telling me she wasn't wearing makeup in the beginning girl you don't need no makeup
under the charm of the most ICONIC person of our generation
i thought the contour was a glue stick and got scared
I'd expected less mistakes in application of fondation and she is so beautiful with soft make up on, this really is a make up for a shooting photo.
у нее лицо желтое, ужас
Omg. I would look like a clown in that makeup. But still happily watching the tutorial though :) she is so cute. Except for the foundation. Think it a little too yellow?
how small is the sponge she uses for the concealer
lol her spin into frame then "Nah I look fat" LMAO girl I wish I was that fat. You look incredible
First question  Did she wear a orange foundation? Second question  WHY DOES IT LOOK SO GOOD???
GODDESS 😍😍
She looks amazing with or without Make-up 😍
ปังไม่ไหว
Rihanna teaching me life lessons in 10 mins x

Rewatching this cause why not?

She is absolutely gorgeous and her voice is soooooo soothing ❤️✨  And she is sooooo humble and such an amazing role model
Omg, she’s so gorgeous!!!

"This is a little messy right now, but I'll handle that" life quote brought to u by Rihanna whilst she contours💕💕
She is absolutely gorgeous!!! I love her ❤️❤️
Pão!
Hi👋

literally can i be rihanna's baby
Stupid Rihanna she thought she need make up. Stupid Rihanna
That’s my girl Riri baby, ladies with forehead are the most beautiful on earth 🌏 that’s because I’m one of them 👌👌👌
Her laugh is the cutest 😂🥰
ALGUEM PELO DIOGO PARODIAS?

"THE BLEND IS REAL" - Rihanna

You wiggle around alot lol I love you girl true icon 💛
She makes makeup soo fun
Why is this my fav makeup tutorial... I never get tired of it..

Гспд,желтый тональник
She doesn't even need makeup, that's how striking she is
Clearly... she pays someone to do this. Money well spent. I wouldn't do my makeup if I was rich. Too many talented makeup artists out there.
Gurl, your foundation is wrong. All that money and still can't get it right.
she has the prettiest cupid's bow 😍
She's so normal, just slathers the foundation she doesn't need on. So cute <3
Nunca canso de assistir esse vídeo, muito linda e Maravilhosa, RIHANNA AMO DEMAIS

"I have huge forehead" 😂😂😂 yeah we all know

Betcha someone else did her brows and lashes.  Also someone's touched up her eyes... especially the lids. That's why there's edits.
HHHHHEEEEEELLLLLLOOOOOO RIHANNA.
" because it says summer, sunset, love ,drama... BiTcHes "  *duck laughing mode activated*

I really love how she's genuinely surprised by her own products
Who dares to hate on ri ri❤💓💕💗
Your face is orange n your neck is pink

Whats her concealer shade name ??☺️
Meu Deus que mulher maravilhosaaaaa 😍 😁 Galera, se tem algum BRASILEIRO aqui lendo meu comentário eu  tenho um canal aqui no YouTube, me da uma forcinha aí para eu chegar até os 10 mil inscritos 🙏🏻🙋🏼‍♀️🔔https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHUk-94uePvG4qm7d32yxeg?sub_confirmation=1
and to this day....i'm still waiting on a single or an album to drop.
i thought she was already wearing makeup in the beginming
I think she is mad
« summer sunset love BITCHES » I love her 😭😭😭
Wonder why the colour is so orange looking. Defo doesn't match with the rest of her.
She looks baby
this is the ultimate serotonin boost
You look good WITHOUT makeup💄💋👑 👧
Ya.....Who knows Rhianna can be the next talk show star......I am so enamored by her charm
5:31-5:37 😂 love that for her!😂
NO offense.....BUT THAT COLOR....DOES NOT..match ur skin tone...... :)
Rihanna and Will Smith must be related
What type of gloss did she use? Anybody? Please and thank you
Another endochrome drinking satanist with a penchant for spirit cooking parties. Bunch of demon infected shells!!!
ourselves God Jesus Christ Love's blessings you and your family respectfully asfriend Love's blessed you and your family!!!
dude if i were rihanna i wouldn't know how to act
I’m pretty sure I come back to this video at least once a week, especially when I need those good vibes 👏
Yes!🤩
When I feel sad and stressed out I watch this video. Thank you Queen
گوه
hi rihan
Riri is the most woman more Beautiful living actually!!!❣️
OMG she looks just like Azelia Banks!
Rihannna
Loving this look Rhi! Loving your shine even more. 🦋💗🦋
Rihanna being proud with ther forehead while me being sad because of my big forehead 😭
*”hi... SHH...* 𝓱𝓲”

She is so perfect
I'm a simple person. i see Rihanna, I click
She is so beautiful 😍
I use fenty all the time. for more inspiration check me out.
Can someone please tell me which song is playing in the bgm😅
she has an AC in her bathroom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
este mismo video ya lo habia visto pero doblado al español como parodia jajajaj like si tu tambien lo viste
“Pink says sunset, drama, ~love~......BITCHEZ!” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why did she feel the need to make her face lighter than her body? It's her own brand of makeup, you'd think she'd want to produce a shade that matches her actual skin tone.
She is so goregous
She is simply beautiful!
face wise rihanna looks ok now her body is fly
I love Rihanna's makeup
She is goddess omg
A queen
omg 2 years agoooo
Her forehead is bigger than my future
"voila" haha ça a fait rire tous les français !
She is so cleaver she use only her products and also advertisement to all 😅
i actually winked back at her
does anyone know what lip gloss she used because wow
what lip gloss is that??
😮
Rehab 🙌 Justin Timberlake
What's wrong with her foundation?
You glow without the glow. I LOVE IT!!!! Thank you for sharing. Xoxoxoxo X 00000000! Lol
once you start looking at the  AC, you cant look back
I love her perfect heart shaped lips .
Believe me I am a need
oyu mask off oyurself if oyu go out at the street, believe me oyu not need make up.💖
Fenty Beauty is the best

She is beyond gorgeous naturally
Body Lava
I love Rihanna 😭❤️I look up to u so much
حرمة رمضان غلطة كي نصنفك برماءيا غلطة يريهانى لجبهتك كي رومانى لاي هاي hhhhhh
não entendo nada,mas é tão poético
i love rihannas energy
Concealer depends on bad decision..deep....well said👏👏👏
This came out when it was my birthay 3 may and its tomorrow 3  may
I love the way she says contour
rihanna and paris hiltons voice is sooooo....👌👌👌👂👂🙀😏😌😌😀
That foundation is ORANGE af. Does not match her skin colour at all... oxidized or not.
She is a devil worshiper
the fact that she didnt tie her hair while doing her make up. ugh thats my queen
Cos it says _summer, sunset, love, drama,_ *BITCHES*
I watched the whole tutorial just smiling like a dumbass watching her big sister doing girly thingies OMG ! Great human being
O que é que ela quer E eu disse " huuu, o que eu quero , você sabe o que quero querido " Eu quero ... pão  Minha ícone 😍🇧🇷
SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL I LOVE HER
even she can’t believe how vibrant her own makeup products are
I thought she was already wearing makeup when she first came in. God she’s gorgeous.
the one and only, Rihanna ❤❤❤
Shocking that it proves over and over again that no matter how beautiful we are to others, we can still find something wrong with ourselves at times, when she said that she was fat sometimes I almost fell off of my chair. But, I'm not her, I only adore all the more for saying it. Which is crazy but it made her so relatable. I love you Rhi Rhi.
Bro she got a big forehead
Her makyaj markası sahibi makyaj yapamıyormuş bunu da anladım 😀 o fondeten sari alt tonlu sen pembe alt tonlusun. Kontur rengi yine soğuk renklerde rihanna sıcak renkli. Herşey tamam en azından göz altı aydinlaticisini doğru renk sürseydi. Çok amatörce olmuş. Lütfen bildiğin işi yap ve şarkı söyle.👎👎🙄
Whenever she brings her tattooed hands to her made up face I always feel like it's another persons hands.
Hi, I'm Arria and I'm new here, could you please subscribe my makeup channel in https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfF3hzG11ipwDDxbBMFSl7g Thanks! 💜  🧡💜
Eu escuto a voz do Diogo...
no one: Rihanna: *cOntUUUor*
Doja cat say so(colour choice male
She forget to cover neck
She’s literally so gorgeous 😍 is there anything she can’t do
só me vem na cabeça a paródia do Diogo paródia
She is the cutest thing on the planet ❤️
قال الامام علي عليه السلام ياتي عله الناس يكون الحق باطل والباطل حق
That tattoo is awful. Why SO much makeup? This is the problem _ Do I really like a woman/girl without her makeup?!
I just started laughing at her intro😂😂😂
“Ok that’s only half of my face” before she made her forehead
"o narizinho vc afina ou opera, diz que foi sinusite"
The amount of times I’ve watched this video is out of this world.
why can't i just be rihanna?
You born ready
Wonderful as nobody in the universe
Yes queen
Rihhana is such a bae
Rhirhi casa comigo?
She literally needs no make up. Her routine, actually everyone's routine should be sun block lotion and that's it.
Why can't I stop watching this, um a dude😖
Looking forward to her 5 second not going out makeup video as most are not going out.
Rihanna would be the coolest friend xx love her
I can watch Rihanna all day
I love her endlessly
im a guy why am i watching this
Só consigo pensar no même desse vídeo, com a dublagem em português.
So she walks into the camera at the beginning and I'm confused af. I'm like, "Why is she already wearing makeup tho??" 🤔  But then she started applying her makeup. . . 🤦🏾💛
That's too much make up for one session for me. On her shoulders, it doesn't stain?
Her makeup look goregous
love her!!!!
Honestly she cute
That's a big forehead
I love how she talks about her forehead being big and she not fazed by it, because people talk about all the time
i absolutely love love love how you make me feel like i am sitting there with you, thank you, i love you, you are beautiful always all the way around.
🤩
She is so sweet, you don't even know! :)

I never knew that concealers are also used  to hide bad decisions. 😂
I like the fact that she looks the same with or without makeup

I feel like it's a how to on confidence rh
Yes ! It’s Rihhana lovely version :*
I miss rihanna 😩😩
Kylie should be taking notes

She’s so pretty ❤️❤️✨
issa goddess 🥺💖💖💖
Now that's relevant content !! loved it! take a look at these tips here: womanby.com  😻 😳⁉
Le voilà quelle nous a lâcher 😂😘
Rihanna, Bruno Mars and Will Smith must have been brothers in another life, they have an incredible personality I love them😘
Rihanna:''Concealer is made for hiding bad decisions'' Me:Welp...''Ima need loads of Concealer😂''
all that look and the foundation didn't even match lmao
are those her natural eyes? their so pretty
Her skin is perfect
Celeb or not, the start of the video shows how down 2 earth even the richest of people can be. People only judge others thru jealousy, great video :)
I hope once I’ll get so much money to afford fenty 😆😁
Soooo gorgeous & has a beautiful personality! She deserves the worldddd
EU VOU FAZER A BAIANA EU SOU UMA BAIANA
IVE LOVED RIRI SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN and now she’s making tutorials
Her foundation shade does not match her neck at all. Is nobody gonna say something?
'My vibe for summer is more and more...' my college professor handing us assignments for summer break.
Just wanted to drop a comment cause she's prefect
Gosh she’s so confident yet humble and down to earth too you go girl ❤️
is that her real eye color?
Her face looks a little bit yellow but she's awesome
E estranho ver esse vídeo depois do Diogo Paródias 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Which gloss is thst???? I need it!
The fact that this is 10 min and the other videos are like 20 min ..no I want more with BAD GAL RIH RIH!!!
This is the best guide Vogue has ever done ever.
El unico comentario en español jujuu
"love, sunsets, drama... bitches" yeah sounds like my life
Conclusion: She doesn't need all the make-up, she is already gorgeous!
I love your songs xx 😃
A queen!

5:43 😂
BEACH PLEASE!!! 😆 *get it?!* .. Yeah.  LITERALLY me when I tell a joke and no one laughs
What is the music it's obsessive
Ariana Grande?????
Idk what it is but something about her voice is so soothing,I can listen to her for days😍
Rihanna's voice is so therapeutic, I could listen to her all day.  Edit: I forgot to add the word “voice” did all of us literally just not notice that at all?? Haha
Ms lady your skin is beautiful you don't even need makeup
最初から最後まで四六時中可愛い😍😍😍
Matching foundation?? Not today, honnnnney 😁❤️
My name is rhianna but it sounds the same as yours
step one: be absolutely gorgeous
You forget about neck !
Let me do it for you.
Why the shade of her foundation doesn't match her? i meannn.. there are so many shades and she chose the wrong one
depends on who im going to see haha so cutee
Queen
For a minjte I thought her weave was gonna come off at the beginnig of the video.   Why riri? Whye? Cant u have a bomb weave with all yo millions?
LOVE!!!!
Ela e muito Deusaaaaa💕🇧🇷
Rihanna is such a mood I love her
Where is the lip?
But the foundation isnt't matching, it's way, too yellow for her.
When rihanna said, "I'm black" "that's a very special nose" I felt that. Lmao
most beautiful woman on earth, im so in love! i like how playful this video is, how she seems to genuinely enjoy experimenting with makeup so its amazing she has her own makeup range - without even advertising her products in this video!!
What mascara she use
Rhianna: “Hide that double chin” Me: 👁👄👁 wha-
Rihanna you are so adorable.  ❤️❤️❤️
I love her personality... ❤️ I also love how she talks about her nose. She calls it special and I am living for it! Confidence! 😍
Love youuuuu   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0gYRFZZjgwNfldrR1VcivA?view_as=public
Riri is so dramatic 😂❤️
Gosh you’re so pretty😩
QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEN 👑👑👑
https://youtu.be/c4oSwm_Vf2U go watch best video👀
Does anyone know what she used for the inner corner of her eyes ?
Is she 50% of the time drunk or 50% drunk most of the time? I mean it in a funny way. She's too cute!
best video in vouge omg i can't get enough
I always come here if I'm having a bad day
The face color doesn't match her skin tone., it's too orange looking. Her eyes look great!
My love Riri 💟💓💚💗❤💜✨💝💞💘💖👺🔥
"If it doesn't fit in my purse, then i'm changing my purse." That's the kind of girl power I need despite of being broke.
She’s gorgeous!!!!!
essa cor parece mais clara não fica o tom dela no começo
Most iconic beauty vlog everrrrrrr
5:30
So pretty
I came here after Cosma. Tip: Un pene sotto il mento, ti slancia il collo come un cigno
❤ perfeita
Rhianna looks prettier Without make up. I wish that was my problem, lol.
Rihanna ♡
i love the vibe
Way to plug in her makeup line!
Bruh my girl all over the place
You took about 5 minutes just with foundation.
No one:  Rihanna: *twirls* no I look fat  Lmao she’s so cute
Só consigo ouvir a voz do Diogo nela
Riri😁 I love your personality omg  and you always look beautiful never are trying too hard ...💎💎💎🌟✨✨✨✨✨🔥🔥🔥love to youuuuuu💓💓💓💯👐👐👐

the skin color before is way prettier, too much yellow in the foundation
She is so funny 😍😍😍
At 8:19,she says a little zest or of？what is the"of"？ Sorry,i am an English learner😂
Alguém faz legenda 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🥺🥺
Concealer is used to hide eyebags,dark circles and bad decisions..... That was deep
Lmbo...You are silly!!!  Thank you Doll!!!  You are appreciated!
Ok so idk anything bout makeup and I'm just asking...but wasn't her foundation too yellow?
Bah die ist so unsympathisch und ist wirklich nicht hübsch.
I can listen to her whole day
Ok 😂 your face is juste YELLOWER
Woahhh I love RIHANNA
Epic
اللي جاي من معرب لايك XD
a voz do diogo paródias combina mais com ela do que a propria voz dela
So.beautiful. Wow.
Her accent is so extremely subtle. I'm so glad it's still there. It's really beautiful and interesting.
She is bizarre. Like the good kind of crazy. I like how she compared covering up dark circles to bad decisions, haha. Cute. Really cute. This chick is awesome.
I love her big forhead its cute
I'm a guy and I'm still tryna get in on this
She's so beautiful. Increíble🤯😍
Eu quero é PÃO
Wish I was rich enough to “warm up the product” like that😂
Lmao if I ever got my face all up in the camera like that everyone would be like: AHHH
Shes so beautiful inside and out 🥰
She's stunning
Guys, Rihanna’s lips 🔥
😍❤️
The secret is ‘no more music’ !
Love her but the foundation looks a tad too yellow for her skin.
Ri u don't need no make up ur already beautiful. An keep that thick look I love it.
I love Rihanna. She's so funny, kind, and down to earth
Her cupid's bow is insanely perfect ugh
Só lembro do Diogo Paródias quando vejo esse vídeo da Rihanna se maquiando
i dont know why but when she was conturing and talking about her being fat i cried
Viewers are more than subscribers. Do u know why?
No one gonn say that in the whole video RiRi didn't even mention her brand, like not even once she said she's using Fenty Beauty and she used all and only her products!!!?? #queen
goodness I just  love her personality
She is beautiful without makeup but she makes her makeup ACTUALLY!!!! ACTUALLY enhance her beauty🥺🥺❤️❤️I love it
Só eu que fico lembrando as partes do Diogo Parodias?
muito estranho assitir esse vídeo sem a voz do Diogo paródias
So beautiful ❤️
Bad gyal Re Re
Love you Ribnanna you are my favorite
I love her personality persona like omg she’s my spirit animal😘😍🥰
https://youtu.be/ZScDOf25yy0
After Tiffany and Jessica's make up routine, now I'm here and I can see the difference  . . . . . . . . and it's amazing!
I'm an old white lady and I don't like the music, however I like her down to earth personality on her tutorials and I love her makeup, the prices are okay and this is good makeup. But, I'm not fond our her nail shape nor that color, but that's just me, I like neutrals and frosted pale colors on nails
E eu que vim pelo "Diogo Paródia"
That foundation is not her shade but I LOVE ME SOME REE-REE.
Does anyone know what products she used?  Thanks!
#diogoparodias só lembrei de vc 😂😂😂😂
I have a gloss that is that color but mine is a little more pink than gold
Rihanna smiling just made me smile
"wehr goin to the clurrb" haha, love her
To this date, I thought bronzer and contour were the same thing.
seriously love this. why do we all feel fat. your perfect and beautiful and so skinny. Sending positive vibes. this is amazing
That’s exactly how I learned to contour!!!! Make up in general!!!! I gained 60 lbs! And miraculously figured out the secrets of the contour and highlight!!! Now if I can friggin figure out how to apply lashes!! Thank you Rihanna!!!! 💜😭
Your skin may need a makeup but not your personality.
What foundation number is she using?

"More is more." — Rihanna 2020
I learnt to have FUN while doing my makeup just coz Rihanna made it look like fun... Iconic Human💘
I C O N
I just watched the Kylie Jenner beauty secret and the comments are all like wow her bathroom is bigger than my town and her face costs more than my life and the comments on this video are so different like ur a goddess iconic some people are so rude and judgemental God said love your neighbors and everybody equally don't hate and don't compare
Her skin is flawless without the makeup though!!!
Queen Rihanna<3
Omy God before she did her makeup..she looked like she had makeup..love her

I literally just fell in love with Rihanna. Glorious beauty
Concealers are used to hide... bad decisions. Chris Brown was choking in that moment.
"Voilà" 🥺
Rihanna, you're goddess but you have too bright foundation...
0:01 "No, I look fat..."
so cute! and honesty
''kinda cute'' girl you look amazing
I was surprised when she said she used to be overweight like u seen her 😂
Doesn't need a stitch of makeup just gorgeous

YouTube: *knows I can’t go out* Also YouTube: recommends this
Amazing video 😊
why is she the cutest human being in the entire world???????
Самый живой, оригинальный и позитивный монолог, который я слышала. Рианне надо создавать видеописьма и читать лекции!
7:23 Jesus, that highlight is blinding. 😳
the most iconic make up routine
I love Rihanna. She is one of those female personalities who is confident in her being and appearance. That makes a woman truly appealing.
Omg I love her vibe
9:02 she flashed us you guys 🤣
Rihanna: concealer's made for bad decisions  My parents: honey I think you need concealer
she should be an beauty influencer
Don’t worry just I’m at 2:55
“OOOOOH!!!.... guys, I mean you guys...” ICONIC
Mlee47611@gmail.com
Rihanna should have a YouTube channel where she does get ready with mes for awards and shows and she vlogs her daily behind the scenes and backstage for concerts and music videos and she could do collabs with people like Jim Parsons it would be so lit
Adorable!
Magnifique Rihanna une video que je regarde en repeat and repeat super merci beaucoup un maquillage parfait pour une femme parfaite.  Voilà s'est dit. Vive la beautée de Barbados.
Remove wig and make wakeup we all know you don’t have hair
As someone with a huge forehead....I feel greatly supported
One of my favorite #ICONS  right down to the name and no shade but I don't like Rhianna with long hair, sheesh she looks way more beautiful with short and medium.
Girl when she came in I was like dude... She has done her makeup beforehand? She is gorgeous with or without makeup ...😍😍❤❤
Her accent is completely gone!
i feel like she's tipsy doing this video
Yes baby you beautiful so humble I love you
Lipgloss please?!?

Rihanna is the queen of all the queen in this world 👌💖love you ( i m french ✌️)
It's beautiful, but doesn't match her skin tone. I need women to start doing better with the foundation matching.
Imagine being so rich that you don’t care about the amount of concealer thats wasted on your hand for “warming up”😂😂 #nohate
I like how she seems so excited like a highschool girl doing make up first time, she's so cute 😂
wow rihanna aged horribly
Love this girl xx I hope I can meet you soon xo 💜😊💜
Rhianna is sooo pretty with or without make up,  such a legend, i love her make-up.

I could never get tired either this video or her.
Why didn’t she use the fenty concealer ??🥺
Ok. I been lying me seen this with the "'fundraising situation'', but the happy reality it's that Rihanna is so gorgeous

She is literally the best I love her she’s a goddess
EU QUERO.... PÃO!
Pause at 7:27
The foundation isn't suits her neck skin
Start shooting everyone on the news media shoot the president with a gun in the head
I hate my entire life. Every minute of it. I wish I was never born. I wish I was dead. I hate America for what it's done to me. I pray I find the strength to kill myself tonight so the torture is not allowed for them to keep using as an absolute terror weapon against me. I'm not joking. I'm not having fun. I seriously wish I was dead and they just keep making my life worse everyday. I want to kill myself right now. I don't want live anymore at all.
è bella ... Ma Nn credevo avesse una fronte così alta !!!! Troppo alta
You are very true)I love your sense of humor👏👏💐
I don't wear but I enjoy watching doing this
Só consigo pensar na dublagem desse vídeo que o Diogo parodias fez ???????????

Love her attitude😏❤️
omg RiRi is so cute!!!
Clap hands for this gorgeous queen, I have to be honest No one not a single soul deserves you
this is so funny
I wanted to see how she does the brows
RIHANNA ♥️🙌♥️🙌♥️🙌♥️
I appreciate the fact that she has ZERO marble in her bathroom.
She doesn’t look like different with or without makeup!!! She has a perfect face!!!!
She didn’t use a primer .. important step in my opinion 🤔
Eu quero pãooooo
I love how real Rihanna is.
When Riri said she looks fat. I was like where girl?! You look fabulous!!❤️❤️❤️
Perfect 👏🏼
Most entertaining vogue i ever see
Without makeup you are just the same ,it's Amazing
I don’t get why people with perfect skin wear foundation ? In fact, if I looked like this I wouldn’t bother buying make up
I love this woman !!
Riri fun to watch you. But wrong foundation colour!!! Did anyone notice?
Rhianna has her own makeup line and a fountain don’t even match her..... 😭
Queen 👸🏾
tremenda bomba esta mujer la amo
Beautiful forehead
Plsss can someone tell me whats the name of the lip gloss ??
Step One: Be Rihanna. Step Two: there is no step two.
Rihanna has more charisma than the entire Kardashian family...she is 👑!!
I can't believe the fact that there is somone hate her 🥺💚❤she is perfect

Who else do their make up to this video? I feel like she is so funny and get me into sassy and fierce
Hm remember was thinkin shes a singer, now just that rich boring woman
Why am I watching this? I mean...I don't use make up, I do have assignments to write...why am I here? Oh yeah...it's Rihanna
This video was SO cute. Rhi is amazing and I absolutely loved this! Gonna try some lava next “date night“. (Also Black, so I have a very "special" nose situation going on, Lol)
Testa de arromba navio
2 things I love about Rihanna: 1. Her beauty💗 2. Her personality💗
The queen lol
That is not her foundation color
she looks much better without make up and perfect with make up.
Anòl diab
Licence pro une anne Blanche scientifique
Feia que nem a peste.
It just me or her foundation doesnt match
Так стоп, она что не наносила основу на шею😳или забыла???
This what they call natural beauty 🥰
Heck Hay Gurly=Makeup Hides The Whole Beauty Of Yoself
i would die for her
Já pensou acordar do lado dessa delícia de mulher, q testa maravilhosa 😜
She looks so funny...😅😍😘
Is it just me or does she wear the wrong foundation colour? It's way too orange for her. And the difference with the neck is huge.
I want her to do my makeup
BEAUTIFUL BEFORE AND AFTER
Как же она постарела:-  такая тётушка Рианна - по ту сторону экрана!
I am officially in love with her
dude this is the prettiest woman to ever exist
OMG she's so good at makeup!!!! it's like magic, can't believe how come that colors fits so perfect on her face!!!!!!!
What fat.  Stop that LSD. you ain't fat 🙄
Cannot believe someone could abuse this beautiful piece of human
as a guy I've learnt a lot thanks ........now to experiment on my other half
love love love her but she has a red undertone, and the foundation is a lil yellow. she pulled it off doe
Dope!!! Love you
she's so pretty 🥺
She is so spoiled.... And all the background cheap crows  cheering when ever she does some stupid simple things or just laughs - is so disgusting... There is nothing real around her and even she seems that she is living a fake life... I feel sorry for her...
What would really be helpful, Vogue, if you let us know each product she is using like the lip gloss name.... Things like that... @vogue
I'm waiting for you to come and get me.

5:45 "I'm gonna start with pink because it says love, drama, sunsets.. biTcHeEs" 💀💀💀
Her face looks so featureless without makeup. It's pretty sad what makeup does to your face after long periods of use
"I got a huge forehead" I STAN AN HONEST QUEEEN!
She needs to open YouTube channel
Rihanna is soo sweet
YAY GO MAHOGANY 💐💐💐💐💐💐

sale blackos
For me Rihanna is the most beautiful woman in the universe
Rianaha is on fire ❤
Cuteee
Awkward moment when the face of the brand can't match the foundation...
"I learned how to contour when I gained weight" Iconic
Starting it WITH makeup already on.. where MOST start fresh.. yawn
What’s going on with her foundation!?
I swear that forehead has it’s own planetary system
"Summer, Sunset, Love, Drama, BITCHES!"  I can't XD
C m hace q c ve mejor con su tono de piel, aunque c ve bien maquillada
She’s literally looks like a princess
now celebrities get paid to be themselves...and now they have made being themselves as the most fake thing....loool
Umm... kinda disappointed...
her face looks yellow after applying all that make up
The beginning had me scared but it turned out so cute and she seems so outgoing
Is that her real eye color it's beautiful 😍
Rihanna: "I look kinda cute."  *U LOOK LIKE A GODDESS, GURL!*
One day she'll be pregnant with me :D .My dad told me yesterday hahah
"Hy" "*SSHH*" "Hy"
i thought she already had the makeup on before she started. luminous skin af!!
She's just so great to listen to
You Are  So  Beautiful And  You Are My Idole🌴🌴❤🔫😭❤❤❤ I love youuuuuuuu
she is beautiful without makeup!!
End of the video and and my heart is like whoop whoop!
She seems so genuine!!
Her skin seems to have natural cool tones
That pink-ish/lavender-ish eye shadow is sooo pretty.
Rhianna couldn’t get any more beautiful than that frfr
Lol you look horrible makeup is a disease.
She blended her foundation in... Ik y’all saw the end result!!
Shed just beautiful I swear
"Heeeeeey hoje vou mostrar a vocês como ter esse balanço...." 🇵🇹🇧🇷
Si dudas al natural es muy bella 😚
No primer?????
If I had a date with Riahana...I would take her to n/ naka restaurant in L.A.......we would get slightly drunk on saki and wait for her limo driver
She’s so pretty I can’t
Bombe
Oh my gosh you're telling me when she came in she had no makeup on???? I thought that was the everyday look!!!!!!!
i love her hair
She is so fun to watch
imagine being so pretty like riri :,(
BEAUTIFUL
Ever feel like if you hadn't been born ugly.......
it was very intersting but two fast
Nothing can hide that forehead 😂
That ain’t ten minutes
Rihanna, you dont need make up.  You are naturally beautiful

She makes me wanna start wearing makeup and show the world just how confident this island girl is. I've been coming into being more body positive and Rihanna is honestly my inspiration. Love her lots❤❤❤❤❤

She is much perfect without makeup 💄
I thought she was already wearing makeup 👄
She already have a bunch of make up, cheater
I've never seen someone so fun and educational on a makeup tutorial. I Loved it. Nice!👌
Last time, I was at the parking of my grocery store with friends, and a truck came to deliver some stuff. Why am I saying that? Because the whole truck could fit on this girl's forehead. Not to be mean, buuuuuuuuut...
She looks amazing with makeup and without, she's literally gorgeous
Waterman Rabbit Woman,Not easy Woman!!!
Uhhj voseh sabe o que eu quero???? Eu quero pÃO
Her skin is soo clear, why so much foundation
Rihanna is ugly,if u look close and not too long,make up does the opposite so be thankful for your worth
I am a man, and I just came here to see how beatiful you are, every women in this world is less beatiful than you
“concealer covers up bad decisions, hangovers” *i felt that*
"Eu quero...Pão" Só consigo lembrar disso vendo esse vídeo mds
The blending skills are not on point.
RiRi is perfect! Now, doss anybody else also think that foundation was too yellow? I mean, her face and her neck/body were completely different.
Does anyone know which body shimmer is that? She has 3
I don't even do makeup I just wanted to se riri 😍
Diogo paródias pq me fizeste ficar magoada ao ver a verdadeira voz da rainha riri

It is funny looking at all these videos which we ordinary people love , we know than the most talented and most famous people are really down to earth , simple, self deprecating so full of confidence, thank you Rihanna.
Me: *clicks video* oh she's already done. She looks beautiful😍 Rihanna: *starts putting on makeup* Me: wait, what?
She’s so cute and goofy. Andddd she’s beautiful! I love her aura

"Love...drama.....BITCHES"
she's a queen
OMG she is such a down to earth human being xoxo love you riri
Is that henna on her hands?
Vim pelo vídeo do @diogoparódias , lol ♥️
What was the purpose of putting bronzer over her contour? And isn’t bronzer usually shimmery so wouldn’t that be counterproductive?
Pisces are so vibrant! I'm here for it!
That voice is annoying
CEO of have naturally beautiful lips
My daughter left this in my history so I watched it and a few others ,  and WOW ! Makeup is like a secret world men don’t even know about ... Kinda sad to here you talk about your insecurity’s , your all perfect just the way your are 😍

3:56 "and if it isn't fit in my purse then.. I'm changing my purse." Priority, gurl
Too much make-up! You dont need, you are naturally beautiful. I hate make-up! It makes me feel like I played in mud, and put it on my skin and I m going to melt if I sweat. All natural is the best..especially if you are black..but, love you Riri..
i love Rihanna and this video so much!!!!!!!!

rihanna getting shook by her own highlighter is a mood tbh  my bad, highlighter and lip-gloss

stop deceiving the people ryan!!!
She doesn’t need makeup she’s so pretty without it but I love her and I do u boo🤍🤍🤍❤️❤️🤩🤩🥰🥰
dioooos el terrible mujeron que se perdió chris brown, no se la merecia a rihanna☹☹☹
Her laughing and expressions and sense of talking woooooooooooooooowwwooooowwwwoooowwwwoooowwoow Love you Rihanna .  I'm not hear to watch your make-up but I'm hear to see you it's been a long time I haven't see you . Now I'm feeling great love badgalrir...
She is too pretty😳🥰🥰
Wrong colour foundation 😆 Fake american accent, Bajan girl 🙄
love u rihanna
Rihanna belittles Asian people but uses yellow foundation. Asian people don't use foundation like that. lol
SHE'S A PERFECTIONIST ! ❤
I feel like her makeup artist went in and fixed and added stuff to her makeup in between shots where they didn’t show us!!
Just in the comments here trying to figure out what that body shimmer stuff was 👀🤔🧐
Which power did she use?
If Rhianna rolled out.of bed.and walked onto the street to get a cup of tea or coffee she would still look amazing.  No makeup required.
Bro I thought she was wearing makeup in the beginning of the video
In my opinion she doesn’t need makeup.
She doesn't need make-up! Make-up needs her! Natural beauty.
@y'all, a sad person called Sherrod the God is being pathetic and has commented under every positive comment about Rihanna and shaded her in some way or another. Quick PSA to be on the look out for a lil troll
Her makeup never looks good to me, but shes Rihanna so who cares right?
I would pass this wonderful lipstick only on my botton lip, but she's still gorgeous💗👌👌
I just want to let VOGUE know that they are lucky that they have this Youtube Channel bc I am not sinking anymore money in their useless magazine.
Pisces season!!!!! Yea!!!!!
MDRRRRRRRRRRRR
Je la préfère sans maquillage
I love Rihanna! She's so funny and beautiful!
When she talks... ❤🥰
"love - drama- bitches!" Yes.
LOVE RERE ON MEH "

Yes! I love the *smaller* fluffy blush brush she's using, and the way she says "hangover" is great. 😁
i didn’t know i was this in love with Rihanna
Shes going to do her makeup but comes on camera with a full lip?....why
You've heard less is more, now "more is more"
sHe iS sO hOt🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
amazing video!!!!
These ppl are not women stop comparing yourself to them as if they are.
I felt like the foundation was a bit more yellow than her actual skin. But it looked quite nice afterwards tho the face and neck looked different in terms of shade. She loooks really pretty tho.
VIM PELO DIOGO
L9ve it ReRe.
Rihanna is one of my favorite artist so much better than them Kardashians girls she really doesn't need make up but okay

Matte to south

You're even beautiful  with out any make up,  like natural.  Riri love
She’s so genuine 😍
I love you so much Rih😩❤️❤️
But why did she put an yellow foundation
Acho que Ela errou o subtom da base. Ficou muito amarelado e claro, parecendo uma máscara, tem diferença com o pescoço e colo.
Ughhh i love her so much 😘😍❤❤❤
She's the queen 💫💫💞
Rihanna so gorgeous!!!!

"how much highlighter to you want?"       Rihanna: yes
Oh anyone 2020?  God, she so cute! I love her so much and missed her live performance
Edit : she has a professional make-up artist that does her make-up every day for her.  So ignore this video tutorial
у меня тат на тре похзже ты не нравишся но неприближйся а то умр ем
Riri is gorgeous and real... on a serious note, how many brushes do I need for my face?? 🥰🥰😛
This is why she is so amazing at making makeup. Because she loves makeup as much as her customers!
Brilliant I'm digging the look(｡♥‿♥｡)...seem easy ❓

Rihanna: “If it doesn’t fit in my purse, I’m changing my purse”   Wish I was rich enough to say that
Her eyes are so white. Wow! Wonder what she does..
💃👑💅
Beautiful Riri ♥️👌you are a humility and great person ⚘👏love you
Arabic Hana on her hand lol I love it❤👍
She literally don’t need ANY makeup. so perfect
I wish Rihanna could teach me personally how to put highlighter on and look luminous instead of looking like a glitter bomb blew up on everywhere except my cheekbones ‘orz
god if you can hear me right now, just know I am so sossososososoososoososo THANKFULL for giving us Rihanna!
I only have one word FLAWLESS

Her voices is so beautiful even when she talks, go to a studio RIRI

Someone just get me Rihanna’s eyes. I dont want no diamond blue, amethyst golden i just want that seductive grey.
Omg, i made a stop-frame at 4:38 and looked on her right hand. What is it? Why is her tattoo so bad? She's earn enough for a better master, i think...
She is so lovely, so cute, so charming, so pretty, so funny,so everything
Riri you are silly.
My ant were your makeup and the boby shimmer
Красотка !

Omg she’s so adorable 😍
U can't imagine someone looks exactly like u .....  Renu
Does anyone know what she applied to the corners of her eyes 😍🔥
Por que usa una base de maquillaje más claro que su tono de piel??? Queda raro.. feo
Her amazing energy rocks through my screen. F.R.T!

She hasn't aged one bit and I used to watch her music videos when I was like 6
She says, " I look kind of cute!" Girl you invented cute!
Wrong foundation color...... 👀
She is pretty with that make up on
what lipgloss is she using???
So cute
Excuse me ma'am , but some of us are ugly .
It's 2020 and I still get ready with this playing on
I should not watch such videos.I'm in love ... XD
She's gorgeous
I want to be friends with her like right now
Dios mio,pero Rhianna no envejece,más linda que nunca!!!😘😘😘
SHE IS SOOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!! SHE DOESN'T EVEN NEED ANY MAKE UP
Rihannaaaa u r best
I love the way she puts her makeup on it's so satisfying I'm watching it over and over.
She has a yellow face. Horrible hahahahahaaaaaaa
As a makeup artist is it weird that's the wrong foundation color but she pulls it off I love u girl
*50 shades of foundation, but riri applied unmatched one* duh.
When I wanna hear ASMR i put this video on   Her voice😫
thanks

5:36 thank me later
Her eyes are really beautiful! 😳
😍😍😍😍
She's so gorgeous. Its stupid. And unfair.

Hate her or not, we can all agree she's hella gorgeous
Get that bag boo, I ain't mad...but come on fam, she doesn't need makeup...jus sayin
So grateful to be living at the same time Rihanna is. Thank You for being so fantastic and inspiring!
Skin care routine plzzzz Rihanna skin is so clear and glowing and beautiful but then the makeup is flawless. And pls YouTube channel her plz she’s so confident pretty and I love her vibe.
7:15 "sharktooth brush" *Kisame has entered the chat*
Queennnnn😍😍😍
Island girl keeping it real
Yr so beautiful with or without make up 💐
Hi chubby cheeks
Love Rihannna❤❤❤
Why is she using this tone?? her own skin color is perfect
is she wearing contacts?
Can someone please list all the products she used because I’m about to splurge on some Fenty
Big pisces energy 🐟
8:26 someone definitely went over her makeup because it looks alot more blended afterwards lol
“Hide that double chin... yesssss”
It’s actually so refreshing to see a face that doesn’t look like it’s been frozen and puffed up with cosmetic procedures.
rihanna's personality reminds me of my aunties family and i love it
Yeah but where is the album
am I the only one who thinks that her foundation is way too yellow for her skintone? It was distracting.
OMG as much as I enjoy her music! I’d totally die for to hang out with her! So funny and real ❤️
rihanna falta tu cuello :)
Why Rihanna don’t do music no more
Qui a entendu "voila" à 9:03
is it just me or her foundation doesnt really match her?
first of all 1. Imagine being friends with Rihanna  second 2.  imagine gettin yourself ready with Rihanna
Girl, you are beatiful
I love you Rihanna
Werdtgiopll?k
Hi guyneese Gyal
I love this woman ♡
gread
I’m just waiting for a new album to come out Rihanna
You are beautifull...just a little bit yellow...but gorgeous 😍😘
can anyone tell me the name of the lip gloss she used?
this video is my favorite thing on the internet
What (highliter) does she use for the corners of her eyes ????
Her face is too orange in contrast to her body. I would diminish this difference here. Otherwise she looks great.
Please, Rihanna! Make a YouTube channel! I need this! 😍😍
She's soooo prettyyyy
Stop saying epic, you morons.
You ladies go through alot of transformations with this makeup. I'm happy and proud to be a man right now, because us guys can just change cloths and go. Wow.
👎👎
WE NEED 10 HOURS OF RIHANA DOING HER MAKE UP NOT 10 MINUTES
Look at the very beginning and then click straight to the end result , to me she just wasted 15 minutes of her life to look fake with an unnatural yellow look .
Does anyone know what colour eyebrow pencil she used?
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
She's super quirky!~ I love that. Also I love the look!!~~ 💜💜💜
Wow I love her xD
What is the lipgloss she used , I want one just like that :)
13k haters wow
Sorry RiRi but that is not ur foundation color 🤣😜❤️
"Eu quero um PAO"
You can lowkey hear a jamaican accent in her voice and i love it
LOVVVVVVEEEEEE       FFFFOOOOORRRRR    EEEEVVVVEEEEERRRRRRRR ... . . .. . . .. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love you 😍
that part "its a brand new one"😂😂😂and that loook
QUEEN RIH RIH 💛💛💙💙❤❤
"...summer...sunset...love....drama....BITCHES"
Who am gonna see
she’s just like bob ross
Riri needs to do this all the time .......(Beach please!!!!!)
the accent though🥺🥰😫
She has a dope voice 💦
i dont think the foundation is her shade
“ because it says summer. Sunsets. Love. Drama. BITCHES”
Gross
Voila !
Rihanna: “oooohhh, I look kinda cute”  No sis, you are cute 🥺♥️ and so beautiful 😍
I come back to this vid every year since it got out. Rihanna has the power to lift me up
So no one's gonna talk about her foundation being too yellow and fair for her skin?
why i am watching this? First im a dude. Second I do not go out I waiting rn for my next round of leage of legends.
She promotes for fenty. But she does it very good... because i want to have all the highliters
Did any one think her foundation doesn't match her skin?
She s really not that pretty under all that huge ammount of make up she doesnt even have nice features. I dont know why so much hype about it. Natural beauty its that kind of beauty that does not need over make up to bright. Just my point of vue.
Rhianna be feeling herself 24/7 i mean shes god tear gorgeous and she know it
alcune volte sembra Giulia Paglianiti
Rihanna doesn’t need makeup she’s so beautiful
her foundation doesn’t match her skin
she put on too much foundation in the beginning 😕
She is just a mood
really?  You ain't that serious!
Her: doing makeup  Me:can you tie your hair back
Is it me or does this have bad lighting? None of the base colors seem to match her skin tone but I know that’s not correct
She is actually the first celebrity I know that wears her actual makeup brand        Edit: Celebrities as in singers, rappers or actors/actrisses
Rihanna gained weight and became more beautiful
Here is your face.. & there are your cheeks see!  ...my heart melted 💔
Rihanna is sooo pretty even without makeup😍😍😍😍😍😍
The first few seconds is a mood 😂
Who thinks that her natural face is better than makeup?
She is so barbie ❤❤❤❤❤
Anyone would think she does that for a living! So chilled and she enjoys the result like no other! But It does look like she already had make up b4 she started though
I love Rihanna!! BUT she looks so ORANGE especially when she starts to use the foundation at 0:40
does she skip brows and lashes cause she doesnt use a fenty product for them?
La amo
idk why but she calms me i turn the volume down a little and this is asmr to me
what brand did she use ?
I like her even more after watching this. 😍
bora comprar pão galera???
Love itt but her foundation is a lullll too yellow
I love her personality
I really wish she was my mommy ❤️😁
You look nice with out makeup
l love you Rihanna 🤍
💜
Rihanna you have amazing talent and you're GORGEOUS but that foundation shade..... 😶
step one: be rihanna
13k Dislikes....  Okay Kylie Jenner Wannabe's U Didn't Have To See This..🤷🏼‍♀️

I feel like her foundation is way too yellow...
What’s wrong with the people disliking this video? How can someone NOT like her? These people hate puppys too. For real 🤷🏼‍♀️
I'm a dude why I'm I watching Rihanna do make-up cos it's Rihanna daz all
She's so cute 🥰
Why she’s makeup-face so yellow? She have natural color of face too nice! Rihanna! Your color more pink than yellow
She is so pretty 🥺💕
Her accent is mesmerizing☺️😍
Imagine Cardi B doing her own make up.  Haha!

😂💕
She is so adorable 🥰

A LIVING BARBIE DOLL
Amiga já pode lança música esse ano

Rihanna, don't forget to put foundation on the neck, so it's the same color as your face.
i love how she isn’t shoving her products down our throats! she is such a kind and warm hearted person 🤍💘
her personality is out of this world🥺
Love her!
“It only takes me long when ...(thinks for an appropriate answer) procrastinating”
"Hide that double chin", where Rihanna WHERE?????
she maybe looks like a bijj because of her facial expressions but the way she act and talk, my ghosh she's so cute!
i love rihanna

She is everything
Thanks Ri Ri , this video was a fun watch!
Beautiful!
I BOUGHT THAT ROOOOOOOOOOOOBE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Maravilhosa
Celebrities used to be untouchable and now we’ve got things like this where they can just talk to us and show us how they get ready in the morning
I think Riri had to better decision for her foundation. Please try it on your neck dear, Riri.
7:07  No, please don’t.
If Rihanna ever slightly touch me I think I would cry then pass out
i am obsessed with her accent!
Why is this relatable?
She looks really pretty with the makeup and without it
I luv her
I want her to crush my windpipe
I miss my wifey 😭😂
❤️
Is no one gonna talk about 7:26  LMFAO.
oml i'm in love with her
Do you like a highlighit Rihana ? - A little bit
Wow She sounds like Jane the virgin 😮😮😮😮
lol concealer hides bad decisions!! I tried >>t can't fix my bangs!!
I keep coming back to this video...actual queen
At the beginning I didn’t understand because I thought she was already with make up
I are so good Rihanna and how did you gain Wheight in the first place
I instinctively clicked for Riri without reading the title
her personality is actually LIT
Umm...she's so cute
Goddess
Soooo pretttyyyyyyyyy
Kylie Jenner could never
You cannot not to fall in love with her honesty and self sarcasm 🥰
I'm watching this for the 1000th time
riri honey, wats with the foundation color?
Como se llama la canción de fondo???
I'm in love with her my god
i love her.
Oof that colour match is bad.
Ive always wanted to see rihanna turn into an egg 0:40
she seems so chill and humble omggg i wanna be friends with her
The makeup don't match her neck. It looks too yellowish  like she has a mask on. She should change the shade of the foundation or use more to contour around her face.
She is just Beautiful
She is absolutely gorgeous! But needed to cover neck...foundation may have been a tad too yellow but still looks amazing and natural!
how do i be a woman like this 😔
Who else knows how many times Kilye Jenner coped Rihanna
Rihanna is so beautiful. she’s a miracle  🥺❤️
I didn't think it was possible to love Rihanna more but here we are
What was the lip gloss she used?? Does anyone know?
her foundation doesn't match. at ALL.
seni yerim
LOVE YOU SAVAGE QUEEN
She always has a bling
I love you RIRI! You're beautiful in every angle!
Never seen Rihanna so close up..... she doesn't look like how I thought she looked
My forehead is one of my biggest insecurities,, and then there's Riri and I'm like "how can't I be that gorgeous".
omg she forgot primer
cun-toor? or cawn-tour?
Omg she so cute i wanna cry
...and bad decisions" i felt that.
so is no one gonna talk about how perfect her cupids bow is
I love her 😭❤️
Gosh Riri is so so freaking cute and adorable...💖

Rihanaaa amoooo
Fake world

Cool
5:43
Someone get Rihanna a YouTube channel, I don’t care what she does. Just get her a channel. Please.
i love how she uses the same shade as my friend for contour, yet it was like foundation when she used it on me😂
Pussu Dolls https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ_--6xtJAU
Young and Beautiful Jay-Z should have stay with her
Rihanna so beautiful she should have stayed with Jay-Z she's way better looking than Beyonce she looks beautiful with makeup and without makeup

Many people told me that I’m doing wrong with my make up but I just do it like Rihanna I think I’m a pro😂
She is so talkative and naturally hilarious.
You're so Cute 😘
why the foundation colour so yellowish
After 10 min watching the video I realized that was about make up 😂😂😂😂😂😂 But Hey is Rihanna That's all that matter 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
"i'm gonna start with a pink on the lids, because it says summer, sunset, love, drama...     *BITCHES"*
bro she is so cute omg
1:56 I felt that 😂
She’s just perfect
Tu est belle ma cherie mmm le tatuage il est mauche
WHAT IS THAT GLOSS
Don't get me wrong rihanna is a super gorgeous girl and she does make up rlly good but that foundation was way to light for her😂
She has HUGE hands
To all the men watching this that don't wear make up and don't have a clue what she's talking about but just watching anyway because u know why... Your not the only 1.
I can't believe someone would raise his hands on her
How can someone be this beautiful?
Rihanna doesn’t need makeup Makeup needs her...
man shes good
OMG...I REALLY DID NOT EXPECT MYSELF TO SEE FAVORITE SINGER GOING THEIR MAKEUP..FINALLY
“We goin to the clurrrb”
I love you 💕
"That is for a very special nose" you  are gorgeous girl!
É impossível ñ pensar no vídeo do diogo
Eita mulher da porra!   Linda, fantástica, debochada e quebrando tabus. I love
I am laughing at Rihanna  right now on this video it's funny.
" if it doesn't fit in my purse then I'm changing my purse" hahaha <3
your make up free face is beautiful
Please check out and support. https://youtu.be/CSSsn-QpqTQ
She puts on makeup without washing off yesterday's makeup, you can clearly see lipstick and eyeshadow before she starts her "Makeup Routine"
Rihanna i love you but i am sorry to say that you are using a wrong fountion shade 😕😕
Minina, por um momento pensei que ela ia passar iluminador na testa
The foundation was pretty orange
WHAT IS THAT LIPGLOSS???? I'm obsessed!!!
Wow your makeup came out out absolutely beautiful!! 😀❤️

Rihanna is a mood 🤣🤩
With or without you are beautiful 💫
🥰🌹
i need to fight whoever told her that she has yellow undertones
looking amaziing but blend foundation to your neck next time ! lol
Can't belive people think Naomi  is beautifull if RiRi exist
Her forehead would need the same amount of foundation as her remaining skin on the face. Just joking she is really very beautiful and I love her 😘
where are we going tonight??
Like that she knows the names of her makeup colours unlike most people..
Shes so pretty
I don't know that she can't or can do make up but she makes smile how lovely she does lol
"Bad decisions"..🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I LOVE YOU!!!!! Drop dead gorgeous Chica
Right... “heads to the store to get some Fenty makeup”
Rihanna is just soooo beautiful it’s unreal 😍
That shade is darker that your skin tone! #foundation
I like you riri; we both know the truth!
The foundation shade was looking weird in the start but by the end it looks beautiful
"... And my nose nose contour, because I'm black *chuckle* and you're know, really special nose..." 😂 😂 😂  Omg I love her!
OMG she is so so so so lovely....😍
Rihanna should have a makeup channel 😸
i love her energy haha 💓
Loves how she keeps it real Very beautiful young lady

My favroute part (bitches) 5:32 5:44 8:26 9:03

She looks Kehlani at the same time
My 5 year old daughter and I Just can't watch her enough. Pls make more ❤️❤️❤️...
She's so pretty I almost feel bad for her, because people probably don't treat her like a human being. Because she doesn't really look like one; she literally looks like a goddess. Good thing she's talented enough to balance it out, lol.
I love her voice lolol
SHE IS SUCH A MOOD I LOVE HER
yellow face
8:41 She's soooo beautiful I love this woman 😍

You have beautiful skin color and you put it yellow, looks like the simpon family. Horror

Riri pls blend down to ur neck- esp ur foundation
she  has a perfect balance between humility and confidence
Umpa lumpa makeup aspirations , but she has a warm pink undertone rather then orange

4:31 did she almost fall lmao
Elle se prend pour qui elle ??? Rihanna ??? 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
So mad shhhh
PERFEITAAAAAA
i really want the mini body lava because i get her when she says ‘crushed up eyeshadows and powder and shimmer’ because i love my skin looking golden. i would apply lots of shimmery highlighter to my collar bones, arms, neck and that was a hassle so i would purchase glitter paste and stuff but that was chunky and peely. so then i would look for kiddies fine glitter perfume/ mists and stuff when i went shopping at a mall in general, i did find a beautiful smelling victoria’s secret ‘Bare Vanilla Shimmer’ perfume which smelt and looked heavenly ( i still have it and use it sometimes) but i still wanted something more. so when jeffree star uploaded his body lava review, i saw it and just wanted it. keep in mind, i’m eleven now so my mum had to buy and confirm for me and stuff. i saw it in Boots the other day ( swatched it, etc.) and i’m in love, my birthday is soon so yaaas! i might get it!!! so heads up to riri, who understood the struggle!
Black girl magic
#RIHANNA #navyordie. 😝😝😝😝😝😝

I do all of this already!!❤ this has been my go to make up look for years other than her use of an orange blush but it definitely suits her, her products make it look so good does anyone know the specific names of the fenty products she used?
I love song need me
I reaaallyy need that self-esteem she has:(
I cant relate to doing makeup in 10 mins but ok
What’s the name of the lip gloss she used ?
Rihanna is so beautiful and her skin is so pure!! Love her voice lol wish she was my bestie!!💕
She’s been saying she look fat ever since she first got in the industry when her and Ciara first met.. HOOOW?
eewww -colour of her head looks so much different than the rest of the body . Why women are so insecure about their faces? 2 tons of makeup will only make you look worse
In Love with Rihanna.😍😍
hey thanks <33
QUEEN RIRI IS AMAZING AND SHE'S REAL PRETTY
Love the way she says you know what I'm saying 😂😂
Anybody think her makeup is too light for her skin or just me???
Perfect video😍 you can find these products here https://amzn.to/34S2JkL ❤
She's cute, but her cheeks look like vanilla, strawberry and chocolate trio.

I love the mix of henna and ta moko tattoos on her hand😍
I love the way this video was shot. It felt very real and genuine. I just love Riri!

Rihanna: some how manages to do her makeup in 10 minutes Viewers: SHE'S REALLY GOOD
Rihanna is queen of belleza suprema ♡♡♡
Her lips are to die for 👄💋
Who else got BTS as ad
Omg I could really see Rihanna being a YouTuber!!
She’s so pretty
she's so cute omg
Love her !
I never realized how big her head is until now lmao not judging but i just think it’s funny LOL
She's so cute 😭
What’s the name of the lipgloss she used?
Because I’m black and that’s a very special nose 😏
I love how she uses her own makeup 😍😍😍😍
I tried following this tutorial only to be disappointed by the fact that I’m not rih :(
isn't her foundation a little too light for her skintone?🤔
Her personality is everything!!
Now I understand why Eugene really loves Rhianna and wants to be friends with her.
How does she have such a defined Cupid’s bow that’s illegal
Beautiful girls don’t need make up (.)
Rihanna is my spiritual guru
E eu esperando a voz do Diogo
‘I look kinda cute ‘
Is it just me or dose Rihanna look the same without makeup
Pretty both ways. Before and after
Her make up isn’t even good
I LOVE YOU MARRY ME

Omg!! I love you so so much, ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ Come see what goes down in my kitchen, I love music too and cooking 🥘 and cocktails 🍸 🍹  Follow for follow guys
Love love love
I feel like this was just posted yesterday
Why she’s so funny
Her forehead gives me such confidence! I love her!
She needs to make her own YouTube channel asap
2 things:  She used lighter foundation than her skin ACTUALLY needed.   She's such a diva for no reason.
"Hangovers and bad decisions..."😂😭
Aaaaaa how is she so adorable !!!!
Foreheads beamin
5:45 “BiTchEs”  I’m dead
Queen.
Lmfao love you
my name is destiny and lm a big fan shine bright like a diamond love you😢🌹😇
i love you Rihanna
Ok I love her so much and she's so GORGEOUS! but am I the only one that didn't like that foundation shade on her? Also she didn't blend the foundation down her neck.... I'm so sorry I love you!!!
I still say She's scary!!!!
She's such a queen oml praise her 💖
She's a good woman, evidently 💜
She did orange face
I dont know why i love her?
“ The perfect human doesn’t exist!”    *Rihanna walks in*
😍😍😍😍😍
she is SO beautiful <3
I want to be fat like Rihanna
i am madly in love with this woman.
Man i love her
We all need a Rihanna best friend in our life
Know nothing about make up but i think her foundation its a bit off color and she never puts in on her neck so u can see the diference hmhm i like her natural skin tone more . . .  shes great anyways.
I cant do none of that
Anyone who dates her is just gonna have to accept they’re the uglier one in the relationship
how can someone be so perfect i-
WHY IS THIS SO YELLOW??? I thought benefits of having your own brand, is that you can create your own shade.
That foundation isn't her shade not tying to be rude I still love her
She looks great 👍🏼 in makeup 💄. She’s using her own brand Fenty. I’m impressed by her friendly approach 🙂🌹
Qui à remarquer qu'elle disait des mots en francais
My angel 😍😍😍👸🏾
My Caribbean sister 🥰
Só eu sou brasileiro
Eu nem lembrava mais como era a voz original dela , depois da dublagem do diogo parodias . 😅
Honestly I will not let any makeup artist touch my brows, i have hot met a makeup artist that can make them look as fly as I do.

OMG she's just so beautiful!!! And that makeup looks amazing on her!!
ammmm... The color of her face (foundation makeup) is different to her neck.
Riri is the only singer/celebrity that beheves normally, as a human, no like fex Kylie
Concealer  for bad decision🤣😅
Ç
It is just me or the foundation is a bit lighter thanks her skin? Great makeup anyways! :3
My hunny ❤️, will I look good in hazel Green eye contact?
Do you want to do my makeup my love?
Ok she is hot.

This video told me ugly in different languages
She is a real life Barbie doll
If she got a double chin I got a triple chin
Eu nunca vou conseguir assistir esse vídeo sem lembrar da paródia do Diogo. Um ícone!
“Summer, sunset, love, drama, ..... BITCHES.”     I love her 😂 💕
Show cat
I love how honest she is !! Shes so real
Who am gonna seeee😂😍
She’s a pretty black gal I’ve ever seen. It’s hard to find a pretty black gal but Rihanna oh god is pretty. Also Alicia Keys and Nicole S!
Just Wow she look gorgeous without make up
I love her accent 😍
She’s amazing 😍😍but that foundation tho is not it 😬
her accent has become more american sounding :O

What a wholesome girl, we must protect her at all costs 😊
Forever love u riri💋💋💋💋
PLEASE DO A 73 QUESTIONS!! 🥵

She is so beautiful it’s crazy
So pretty 😍
I love gaining weight...and love seeing THICK women...guess that's Why my body fights me so much. 🙄
I appreciate my forehead because of Riri
subscribe to my channel girls for make up videos! xx thanks
I have a big forehead but if I had Rihanna’s face I would feel much better
I don't  know if its just me, but the foundation is a whole other shade than on her skin isn't it?
i think there is no one who hates her😙
I swear at 4:22 that looks like somebody else arm
she's so pretty 💞
Cambio la piel
When she warmed up her concealer on her hand.... My heart literally skipped a beat
memelerini bebek tasır gibi taşıması yok mu 🤭😂🤣😂 çok agır sanırım 🙈
I love Rihanna 💓😍
I swear to god I've watched this video over 50 times
I feel offended when she calls herself fat. I mean, WHAT AM I IF SHE'S FAT?
8:56 ur welcome

Rihanna is like a straight up mood
Goodness, why so much makeup??
She is so cute!💞 I don't get why people hate her🤔
Rihanna’s personality is golden. It’s a Pisces thing 🥰 we’re the best.
Quem esta aqui pelo vídeo do Diogo e queria ver o vídeo original
I have a question.. Is it bad to be a girl in 8th grade and not have any makeup at all? Because i get picked on at school because of it
At the beginning “HI ..shhhh ...hi...”
Shiney as forehead 😌
I love her personality ! 😂😂
Девочка 😊не моя((((((((((((((((((((((

Concealers to hide bad decision lol riri you are d best 😅😍😘
Rihanna should do an asmr video I’d watch it everyday
She sounds like a nympho
Does anyone know the name of the lipgloss she used?? I love it and would appreciate a comment back or tip on where 💕
She’s so beautiful she can literally rub green crayons on her eyelids and chicken grease for highlighter and she’d still be gorgeous!
RIRI she is not pretty
RIRI your is sounds like a witch
Oh my God  RIRI your voice is so horrible to hear it eww
Very very beautiful!
The only human beings that are perfect:Rihanna, Zendaya and Beyonce. . . . . . Edit: Omg I've never gotten this many likes.
everybody know concealers made for hiding bags, dark circles, hangover and bad decisions. - Rihanna.   That’s it, i’m getting ton of concealers now. 🤣
Forehead takes up half of the video
the fbi is watching I watch nothing like this yet it’s recommend and my name is Rhianna—-
her skin is perfect, y did she even use Foundation?!?!?!?!
ILOVEYOU RIRI😘😘
This called me ugly in so many different ways   Ahah ahah thanks for so many likes
Ужасная
Фуу, а татуировки то зачем? Ты же негр, а не индеец.
She is so pretty I can't handle it
No one:  Rihanna: "ooooohhh"                   "ZEST"                  "LASHES"                  "AAAAAAAAAAAAAA"                   "BOOM" She's the cutest😍
She don’t need makeup tho
I love her so much! Wish her all the best! Such a beautiful light in this world 💋
I like Mariah do a night time skincare routine
it looks off, when it doesnt match the color of the rest of your body anymore.
I wish I could watch this in 4k
What is the color for the foundation ?
God !!i love Her  So so so much..she is like so natural
god i luv her so much
“If it does’t for your purse. Then change it.”
4:40 that 'ah' is just too cute
Queen.
Sis concealed her bags, then deadass drew them back on.  Beautiful but like. That’s a lot under the eyes.
That foundation is not her shade
😍😍😍👸🏻
Bélissima amei ♥️♥️♥️
she’s too precious. we don’t deserve her
KD os brasileiros que amam a Riri??
And of course you have to use some of your brand Rihanna
Here’s why everyone loves Rihanna: *shes not a kardashian*
Where is beauty lolzz
RhiRhi always putting out Goddess Vibes
SO she actually has dark eyes? I always thought Rihanna had light eyes .. blue. Was she wearing contact lenses?
Which is this concealer?? Ty!
Her skin is AMAZING! Honestly, she can just use counselor and no foundation and still pull the look! Still, she looks gorgeous with and without makeup! 💘💕💖
Simple but beautiful make up👏👏👏❤❤❤
“Concealer hides bad decisions” 💙😂
Que frente tan grande tiene
"And my nose contour... because I'm black..."   That's racist.
💚💚
but the album...
Rihanna Soo beautiful
Her eyes is everything ❤😍
4:45 since her mom what??
Sorry but your make up is a failure, almost your face powder I think she is used to be maked up by professionnal each day
Love her goofy she is, she doesn’t care if people think she’s weird. I wish I was that confident. Such a role model. 😍❤️
oh she's so lovely! i absolutely adore the vid and the way she talks.
Amo love
Son imaginaciones mías o esa base no era de su tono? Parece demasiado amarilla:v
She looks like she is wearing a mask
She looks better without her makeup
Why do rarely any makeup artists never show them doing their brows?
too much fakeup
*Lashes*   x😅 She scared me      *how much i love her*
She have wonderfull eyes👌🏻😍
The key to high lighter is not being afraid of it.
"There's one way that you like it. And one way that it works"
"to hide the double chin" Um *where* ??
She is soo cute.💓💙

Not a huge fan of her but I admit I adore RiRi’s personality real quick.. 😍😊😊😊😊 she’s so cool...
😫😫😫😩😩😩😩💙💙💙

Acho que a base está fora do tom! Mas é a Rihanna então tudo bem kkkkk
summer, sunset, love, drama... bitches!
Amo esse jeito doido da rihanna te AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO love you Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷bjss
Am I the only one obsessed with this video? She's so freakin' gorgeous and funny, I can't... xD
Her own skin looks much better before the foundation - such a natural beauty
Du bist so schön von Ashley
Why her skin is yellow?
Is nobody seeing what I'm seeing? Why is she that yellow? That can't be what she always uses. Pause at 10:20 when she moves close to the camera and look at her face vs her neck.
Nunca pensei que Rihanna fosse tão feia sem make 😁😁 alguem do Brasil?
Alguém veio pelo Diogo paródias?
Omg love not live
Hi im your bigist fan and i hope you notice me i live you so much ☺☺☺☺☺☺🤩

Thank u for this tutorial girl....I get so confused about contour n concealers highlighter n bronzers n where they go. Now I'm going to buy me some of your  makeup !!! Thanks 😘
I don’t think it looks good, just cuz she’s Rihanna it doesn’t mean her makeup is amazing
I love Rihanna's hoarse voice.. It's so special..
She's like a Jamaican Marilyn Monroe. So classy, so sassy.
C est bien le naturel vous abîmé le visage le maquillage
I like how she says *contour*

I wish she was a YouTuber 😂😭
I wonder if Rihanna regrets her henna tattoo.. it looks messy ..i regret mine
You know your brand REALLY is good when you use your own brand on your whole face. Kylie didn’t use any of her make-up during her vogue make-up tutorial.
Literally thought she was wearing makeup at the start of the video, she’s so naturally pretty that my soul is quaking😂😂
2:54 she is epic
She looks like claun when she added blush
Sabe oq ela quer? ..  Entendedores entenderão

wow...fully impressed by her. personality😍

Neck and face are looking different shade
She is beautiful without makeup❤️❤️❤️
Nice!
She's flawless entertainer what I've seen just now
A started liking her more after watching this video
Hermosa
5:43 Because it’s  Summer Sunset Love Drama    BiTcHeS
I don´t like it. She completely changed the color of her sking making it look whiter. puke!
5:19 very true
i love how the fenty beauty foundation oxidizes into your skin so if you think the shade is to light or dark just give it a couple of minutes
love u Rihanna  Hava bright 🔆 future 🔮
She’s even prettier without makeup
Her voice is so gorgeous
On behalf of all men we believe you are beautiful without makeup   But thank you because you truly put so much effort and men don't deserve it
Did anyone else think in thier head  “That contour is not pigmented-“ No? Just me Cool.
Soo Cute and Gorgeous
Rihanna is cutest😍 She is so down to earth and not arrogant on camera like most celebrities or even beauty bloggers.
Does anybody know what the body shimmer she used is call? Help :(
Love Rihanna, p.s. girl can do her own make up? Accolades
I thought she was hella moody but she is sucha cute,adorable,loving person😭❤
I wanna be best friend with her
I LOVE how all the women understand the concept of knowing your own face = knowing what works for you, it’s a rule I live by, I’m someone who I have to be the one to do my brows because there’s a method to my madness and no one has my hands
Omg the whole time I just wanted to YANK her hair back and pop it in a pony lmao one of my biggest pet peeves and I barely have hair
I love herrrrr
Yellow foundation?????🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Блин как она кривляется ...фууу
Linda maravilhosa te adoro.

Oh for fucks sake the foundation was way off ... It was yellow... Her necks still looks a different colour she didn't even put some on her neck this was completely wrong u need to put it all down ur neck or ur gonna look like ur wearing. A mask and seriously a yellow mask!
“Now I look fat” 🤣
💋
Alguém em português 😊
Salak bu karı ya 🤣 ayrıca ten rengini çözemedim bu karının ? Siyahiymiş baya sürekli makyaj yapıyo vücuduna ve yüzüne diye biliyorum ama🤷🏻‍♀️
That feeling when her concealer is 100 shades darker than ny foundation
The make up color is to yellow for her own skin's tone.  But we know she is BEAUTIFUL with any color.
sun,sunset,love,drama BITCHES
Noo 😢 I was here for the eyebrows. 😭
U looked beautiful before the makeup😢

I think she does not need make ups to be beautiful. She already is! 😊
Rihanna’s makeup look today is my spirit animal 😍
Septembaaaaaaa 1 is my birthday... LIKE me pleaseee subscribe me... its FREE n helpful... :(
Rihanna konuşmaya başlayınca bir Erzurum şivesi bekledim
There should be a no make-up beauty contest for celebrity
Maravilhosa
Hii.. Shushhhhh (softly) hii☺. I stan A queen.
That is a lot of product..thank God that I gave up on my looks years ago:)  ( She is very very pretty, dont get me wrong)
She put 200 layers over her beautiful face wtf
Did she just waste all of that concealer on her hand ? On 2:35 🙈🤷🏼‍♀️😭😭😭😭😭😨😱😱😱😱😱😱🤦🏻‍♀️
Ooh she's GLOWIN (like literally glowing)
She's giving me Gamora vibes
Морда одного цвета а шея 2другого
So down to earth love it
make is the
I have no business watching this video cause I am a guy, you know, like a real man, but she is very very fun.  This is my second video of her, adorable.
Why is no one talking about the adorable little Beauty blender @3:00 😂😂
wtf "I look fat"??? you hella don't
her concealer is lighter than the one i have.
she has a big forehead but it looks very proportional to her face
Concealer is made to hide bad decisions 🤣🤣🤣🤣
the beginning😂she’s so pretty❤️
This is my favorite video on the internet
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
U must be a YouTube girl🍓💗
@vogue what is the product used on the lips ?? None of the items are listed
QUEENNNNNN
I really liked the body shimmer 😍❤️
What was the product she put in the corner of her eye?
Cara ele tem muita muita testa vey
e ainda dizem q ninguém é perfeito
tbh before all that makeup i liked it more
Her accent? GONE
She's beautiful with and without makeup
بوصنطيحة زيانت لك ليام  خويبة و عندك الزهر
Ma quanto sei bella
How did she just say she looks fat... Homegirl the most beautiful person i KNOW

She's so beautiful.  I love you
Seni çok seviyorum Rihanna
Better than a makeup artist
Rihanna looks beautiful without makeup
Her facials expressions kill me so bad😂❤️😭
How rihana can't choose the right foundation for her.. She is a black girl so she need a deeper color or what
You go Rihanna.
one mio clicks for a celebrity girl doing what girls just do....No wonder that Trump is President...
"Epic" and "Make up" in one sentence....I am out!
Highlighter ???
The 11K dislikes were people who didn’t watch this tutorial and winged it looking like total clowns and started blaming Rihanna 😂
her face is yellow×orange
Fenti beauty the best of the best make up 👌
Como q bora legenda mano
I don't know i'm not a hater but i expected more of this tutorial. I'm kinda disappointed somehow. :-(
Why she makes skin look yellow?
when she said ''I hve a big forehead'' lord I so cn related..
Her voice is so relaxing. I can watch her all day..and look at her all day😍😍. I love her
So funny 😍😍
PÃO
She's fun to watch. Whimsical but classy. And look at her face, she looks like a doll😍
May daughter loves Rihanna's make up product line, it's the only one make up that she can actually use for her skin tone without looking orange. My question is, why do you continue to sell your products at Sophora's? My daughter and I was racially descriminated/profiled against by associates, I guess they were told to treat people of color a certain way. It was so bad that management sent my daughter an apology letter and a box of free products. Well, we tried again and again the same treatment. It's like they do not want people of color to shop there. Sorry, but the humiliation is not worth it and we will not be shopping at Sophora's ever again.
Rihanna makes me feel like it’s okay to have a huge forehead
I love Rihanna ❤️❤️❤️
هذي حنا الي بيدها؟
Your so cuuttteeee.
🆔🔥👻🔥K4HULUI🎲🎲📩💯💎
I just love the way Rihanna talks
I literally thought she already had a full face at the very beginning, that is goals
I love her makeup line. And I think she's a fashion icon. Not to mention she's beautiful.
Hot riri and her voice🔥
lan sen ne tatlı bi kadınsın
Hiiii why do the comments have different fonts I’m confused
It tooooo pretty to need make up
Rihanna is very ugly
You are looking gorgeous without make up only... u r not what u are after make up.. even you are applying make up for body also.. y dont u see beauty in your own body?
Por que nao traduz pro  português? Chateada  com isso
THAT HIGHLIGHT IS POPPING
She is soooooo pretty without makeup as well
This foundation is not match with your skin color and this disturbing i think. And you really aged Rihanna. I am sad with this situation 😢
Я тащусь по тебе детка! Ты самая лучшая! 😍
I really cannot believe she really need this much make up, she looks good without it, I think the cosmetic industry brainwashed women to do this. Men walks around with No make up, nothing.
I want an updated version of this Vogue please :))))
0:06 mood

How old is she?She looks like she just turned 20!!
I just have to say makeup or no makeup you’re one of the most beautiful ladies in the world!
Pink says sunset, summer, drama... BITCHES!
“*sigh* because im black you know that’s a very special nose” im dying lmao

MARAVILHOSA
What
How come YouTube is always late when recommending?
What a kweeeen! I love her, she’s so beautiful with or without makeup💕💕
She is far away better than Kylie Jenner
Eu quero pãoooooo entendedores entenderão
I love her personality so much like thank you vogue for exposing the good people
this video was kind of ASMR'ish to me .. until  8:42
Que mulherzinha bem feia... Jesus amado 🤐 Rica testa 😨
Why so perfect? 😪
I love those eyes
This is probably the only vogue video I’ve watched😌
beautiful
Красивая и шоколадная! 👍
She's pretty with or without make up.
I’m so shocked at how naturally pretty she is, she doesn’t even need makeup tbh..😭😭
What are the big lumps there are under the outer eyebrows? It looks unnatural and strange. Whew!
she's really beautiful:( ♡♡♡
Officially best makeup vid I've watched so far
это так камера искажает или действительно тон существенно отличается от оттенка кожи?  на видео после макияжа сильно заметна разница между тоном лица и тоном шеи
2019 anyone? 😂🤷🏽‍♀️
Rhianna has the personality of a bestfriend every girl needs to have!!! She's just oozing with joy and energy! ❤️
Thanks Re-Re

What did she use on her shoulder? She is Supergorgeous 🤓
I love u 😘😘😘😘😘😘 give me ur whatsapp number
that is a bull doesn't take 10 mins, video is but makeover takes much longer and she doesn't show doin' eyelashes so it's too difficult for her, it must be like 3 or 4 hours or a day long and most of it IT WASN'T WORTH THAT
*Purchases Fenty Beauty*
she a real one
I’ve legit watched this video like 5 times because I love her energy 😂🤠
She so cute. Love the highlighter. Super.
Fantastic woman!
I'm not trying to be rude, but for a celeb, that's a old ac you have back there.
rihanna always beautiful, with or withot makeup
really barbie ☹️😭😭 luv u
I could watch her all day long
This girl needs a freaking asmr is it just me or is for voice satisfying as 💖
"I got double chin"  riri where!!!! 😭
Love ya❤️❤️❤️
Diogo paródias deu mais graça
Love everything but love the body make up
I love her products wow
i don't like her tatoos
Riri cool
I wonder what she used for her eyebrows
Amazing girl and singer with a great voice
Rihanna to makeup is like Bob Ross to paintings
u have ac in your bathroom?!
She so adorable
I’m just too afraid to put make up on my face because it has a lot of chemicals in it and will make me look older if I use it everyday. I tried  putting make up on my face before and im not even comfortable wearing it so i just wore it only for 2 hours. My cousin who loves make up looks like a dead person once she removes her make up
Sorry. She's just plain pretty. Not sure anything could possibly look bad on her.
Love her so much but that foundation match... ❤️ I’m sorry
We love you RIRI💕😊
Rihanna ❤️
acho engraçado que a marca tem um monte de base e a rihanna consegue escolher a cor errada pra gravar o video kk linda
Her foundation color doesn’t match her neck though
She is sooooo cute
Wtf? She doesn’t even need makeup
I need the name of this lipstick 🙏🏻
You are cuuuuuuuuttte
She’s so goofy 😂 but she’s beautiful
Fun and quick makes me think I can do it all by myself
What’s the last product she used?✨

She is so real I love her she is the queen 👑 Rihanna your personality is amazing
everyone CAME for huda when she told everyoje that she only uses her products. but no one comes for rhianna when she's ONLY USING FENTY PRODUCTS.
Love her. Had a smile all through the video.
That foundation was waaaaay to light for her.
O nariz vc afina ou opera . Diz que foi sinusite kkkk By: diogo paródias
she’s so adorable
She had a huge wide nose before and wears wigs
She is a real girl in front of the mirror 😊😊
No real difference
Can you just wear concealer only? I really don't like all the foundation
pretty but that forehead I mean 7up head it needs some hair cover
I never make such a many makeup in my face
She is so pretty
she wasted sooo much concealer omg
8:24 Eu só consigo ouvir a voz do Diogo paródias "PÃO!"
i love her but that foundation is too orange
Caribbean girls run it 🇧🇸🇧🇸🇧🇸🇧🇸
يكبر جبهتها😭😭😭
I just wish that the foundation was available in a different finish - the colour was *perfect*, but I have dry skin and matte foundation does NOT agree with me. 😂
i looove the fenty products. I keep the powder in my bag too, it's very nice after bloating. But I feel like she is not choosing the right shades for her tone.. the contour looked muddy.
Rihanna ASMR pleaseeee
Tell us which products you are using. Are you using only your products?
Rihanna girl... U look orange/yellow... Its so bad :/
She is goddess 😍❤️
I swear she’s a whole mood 💀
She is so cute .what a doll . I love her and pink
I'm not sure what ASMR is... but this make my beard tingle.
Thank you RiRi :)
Lovely  lovely superstar
She looks so genuinely happy here and I’m all here for it
Your eyes are beautiful
Omg she sounds so American now! 😂😂❤️❤️❤️

Why the shade when Kylie used her own palette and no shade here?
I LOVE her voice❤️❤️❤️❤️
Her reaction to lip gloss poppin' OMFG!
I can’t be the only one thinking that her face is orange 💀, still love U tho 😘
I keep going back to this video. It’s so wholesome
She's gorgeous.
Your fronthead is very big.
To me it looks like her foundation color doesn't match her face??? It looks way uglier with that weird color on than just without any make up at all. Is it just me?
why is her foundation like 2 times lighter and so yellow
S T U N N I N G.
I look her better without make up. I love her natural skin
Why does her foundation not match tho
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLkfl4n8ko

I love Rihana
Rihanna is the only person in The world who can make music that you can still hear now
I already loved her style but her love of tinted lipgloss... me too girl.
Man down
You’d think that if Fenty Beauty is known for the color variations of foundations then she’d get one that matches her skin tone a little bit better?
She was beautiful even before
i love you cutieeeee
I love the way she says contour
The views THO ! 😲 22,862,402

the fact that she can call herself cute and own up to that     iconic
To be honest you are very beautiful without makeup and all these years I thought you got a forehead reduction but it seems you stayed true to yourself and I'm actually very shocked and impressed by you. You get knew ratings for keeping your original features. Serious ratings

“Bitches” 😂
😂😂😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘❤️👍🏻Ilove you soo much
and this is why i love rihanna 💛
Coming in front of cam with already makeup on your face doesn t make u honest, it makes you insecure, so....next!! your foundation is yellow on your face, doesn t have nothing to do with the neck....and she creates makeup, or better said, others create makeup for her...
Gorgeous 💓 🔥💓
eu quero ... PÃO 😂😂😂
I am so confused. I’m a straight woman, but I think I’m in love with Rihanna. 😖
She's sooooo pretty andd she really interacts with her fansss
2019 anyone??
If you love Rihanna like♥️
Só acho que a VOGUE deveria por legenda em português... nada mais justo né?
Só eu que não sei falar uma palavra em inglês mas entende quase tudo em inglês ?  Ou eu sou estranha mesmo? Kkkkkk
I love her 😍 she is savage
You look fabulous! I hope your cosmetic products will be available in Asia, even here in Philippines! ^^
So much make up ... like what happened to beauty ... it’s ok to enhance it... but don’t go and put 5 pounds on just in foundation and body shimmer ?! 🤦🏻‍♀️ As much as I love you Riri .. I wish you would use less make up ... you were beautiful in the beginning as well ...  just sayin !  Y’all do not need so much make up !
1:22 i have a huge forehead😭WE LOVE YOUR FOREHEAD BADGALRIRI
She is so gorgeous I love her so much❤️❤️😍😍
Can you make some music

Her foundation looked so off but then it looked so good on her face, I’ve never been so confused.

Too much makeup, oh my god! Girls shoud not do that, she looked beautiful at the beginning. Sad

I love her💕 She is a true Pisces birth sign. So entertaining no matter what it is about.
“Because it says, summer.... sunset..... love..... drama. BITCHES.”  but then laughs little baby bunny  (Do bunnies laugh?)
Your such a cutie 😜😜😜😜😜
not fuckin sure why they can’t show the products they’re literally her own products that she produced like you’re not gonna get a copywriter claim
Love you Rihanna
"Eu vou ser a baiana,EU SOU A BAIANA!...Estraguei tudo!"
Hey guys. I'm subscribing at 5.6m 😅
The prettiest natural looking makeup ever I've seen so far in my entire life. Yay?!  And of course you have done a quite admirable makeup.So, I'd love to give you a thumbs up.

KWEEN
Shes soooo cuteeeee!! Queen
Rihanna should open her own ASMR channel or as a Makeup Gurú on Youtube.
"Bitches please" ; "Bitches please" 😂😂😂😂😂 and I die !!!! 😂😂😂
What is Rihanna foundation number? What color did she use for the contour and highlight?
Lovely!!! 😊
Cadê a legenda Vogue? ☹️☹️☹️☹️
TE AMO CARALHOOOOO!
Na voz do Diogo Paródias é muito melhor! Só acho... 😊
Diogo Paródias
Wtf just to put a tiny slide of concealer under eyes she used like 10 swipes on hand that’s wasting!!!! What you just wasted could be a use for 10 times  ☹️
Bacım yıkanaydın
When you forget primer
Don’t ask why me a man watching this but heck was I glued to the screen
Everyone in the summer : less makeup it’s to hot Rihanna : more is MORE
Who is watching this in 2k19?
Rihanna is an awesome person! best "tutorial" ever!
A desgraçada é tão linda q antes d se maquiar já parecia q tava maquiada! Kkkkk 😍
WOW I LOVE YOUR PERSONALITY
i thought she was alone
I guess im the only girl,  who dress up alot but doesn't know how to do make up
She looks so fun to be around, that makeup is great
Que maravilhosaaaaaaaaa
You're beautiful without make up
Te amo lok
Meu sonho era uma legenda haha
o que eu quero? você sabe o que eu quero eu quero PÃÃO
I was watching videos of people making cats jump by hiding pickles next to them, and this came up in my recommended. Not sure why?!  I have a question for women though... As a guy I've never put makeup on ever, but I've always been curious as to whether you can "feel" it on your face when you put it on? I imagine it's uncomfortable.
Linda!!!
Can you do my make up please
Rihanna: I started to learn contour WHEN I GAINED WEIGHT  Me: Kween PuHlEasE, you have not seen my 1 pack ab
5:43
To hide the bad decision.😂😂
Why does her face's color looks different than the neck's color?
What a hottie 😘  Also no hate but omg that little black thing stuck in between her teeth once i noticed i couldn't unsee it xD
8:25 Eu quero é pão! 😂😂  #Diogoparódias😂😂❤
rihanna smiles: 😁  me: * love heart eyes in 24 languages *
Sunset love drama BITCHS
rihanna saying and doing anything at all>>>>>>>>
I LOVE HER😂

why isn't anyone telling her her face color doesn't match her skin tone
She is gorgeous❤️😍😍😻🤤🥰
The make up to give a rompompompom man down
She must be a BOSS in product development and testing meetings.
Linda linda linda linda ❤️ Perfeita 😍👏 Deusa 💜💜💜

Rihanna looks beautiful without makeup and with makeup on❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sem maquiagem não é tão bonita
Não consigo mais levar esse vídeo a sério kkkkkkkkk
https://youtu.be/zhpT_7d-nnw
Rhianna girlie your foundation doesn't match I recommend you use one with a slightly more reddish/pink undertone as the yellow is a little off and you're so gorgeous having the right tone will make it so much better. 😊
omfg i love her
I love you! Can i have you 😭🥰😍❤️💋
Ela poderia pelo menos aparecer da cara limpa  primeiro,  sem nenhum vestígio  de maquiagem,  mas mão  foi o que aconteceu 🙂
Better than Kylie  though. 😩💕
Eu quero pãaaaaaoo kkkkkk
I love how she's surprised by her own products 😂
Her voice is so relaxing  She is so moody and honest
What double chin rihanna what douple chin??...😂
Eu quero PÃO 😂
AMAZING!! She's sooooo humble, spontaneous, this tutorial is so easy and goodt to watch!!! I loved it! Now Vogue needs to invite Bey!!!
Ridiculous ..the only one who ever came on with a ton of makeup to "put on makeup " lmao
PÃOOOOOOOOOO
What’s that lipgloss she’s applied? 😍
Ok was she wearing the fenty beauty bronzer here? 🤔🤔😍
pão
Ela cosegue ser linda ate com essa testa
I'm sorry but I tried two fenty foundations that were similar to my skin but one was too dark and too yellow and the other was way too light. Congratulations on your launch but it'd be nice if fenty foundation had more variety of shades xx
Rihanna is my babe
cOnToUr     no hate i love her<3
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Saw my Queen's name, Im summoned.
WOLLAH Lol
بج
She's amazing, omg!
Rihanna pls can u not dilute the foundations as I have been using them and they were perfect until now and it is not as before the consistency is very watery
i love her speaking voice. it's so soothing to hear. like lullaby
Fenty beauty es uba marca muy buena. Pero aqui podemos ver, que aunque usesmos marcas de excelente calidad, sí, bo sabemos escoger el tono de base, se nos va a ver dispareja la tinalidad, ebtre el tostro y el cuello. Desafortunado tutorial. Todo el tiempo esruve epserando que se oxidara la base o que se emparejara la piel.
😍
She’s gorgeous I love her!
바베이도스 촌년 존예..
Vim pelo Diogo paródias❤
2 kilogrammes make up lmao

What a good tutorial... she is funny  😉
LOOOL the beginning is me looking in the mirror every morning.   No i look fat. And just dipping outta there lmaoo

She's so BEAUTIFUL, and love u!! ❤️❤️😘
Só consigo lembrar do "Vc sabe o que que eu quero... Eu quero PÃÃÃO!!" 🤣🤣
Im jealous of how clear and silky her skin and body looks.
That was Awesome! How come she only said, "lashes" but didn't show how to do them (and her eyeliner) though?

Rhi Rhi, girl, all us lovely more fuller figured women have those  chins (don't sweat it, hun)... We still Love Ya!!  2:23  WATCH Rhianna's Face as she holds the concealer under her neck  (her wide eyes) so hilarious  :-))

She's SO BEAUTIFUL
She looks such a fun girl!

Eu quero PAUUUM
Eae fake
Meta de vida: ser rica igual a Rihanna para ter um ar -condicionado no banheiro
A voz dela só falando já arrepia 😱💗💗
Rihanna's beauty secrets video is literally the best one ever!
Urgh her mind, she used her bronze in this video
Lashes not to long that’s my girl
Rihanna inspired me to do makeup and I’m 9 y/o FYI
Só consigo lembrar do cara imitando esse vídeo kkkkkk
My baby
Gosto da Rihanna pq ela me faz acreditar que eu posso ser bonita com uma testa grande kkk💕
Ripolin😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Honest and funny af. She should be a stand up comedian. Lmfao
I just love Rihanna's genuine humbleness! Truly an idol material artist ❣️😉
This is like a asmr...
still my favourite vogue make up tutorial
感觉没啥区别！哈哈哈😄
Oh my goodness, she’s such a queen, love her
I’m waiting for BTS skin care routine
She still pretty without makeup and always looked the same.
Fake video she is not doing it, they edit the video like she did the make up but when she moves the brush the color is fully there and the brush always covers the colored part of her face to hide this detail
I'm gonna steal this line "if it doesn't fit in,  m gonna change my purse.. " 😆😆😆
Rihanna
Someone pls tell me what lipgloss that is
She don't need makeup!
Rih Rih 👑✨💛💅 Beautiful and Cute without/with make up 😍
What's with her larger than life forehead,...anyways, she is pretty
Ugh just too cute😩
Se veía más linda antes del maquillaje 🤷🏼‍♂️
Concealer to hide bad decisions
step one: be pretty
Rihanna: nah I look fat  Me: than I look like look like an elephant
wow. imagine being _rihanna_
Riri looking like a doll for 10:28 mins straight
Summer,sunset,love,drama BITCHES!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣

I just love rihanna so much......and ..after that video I just loved her more than I do she is so beautiful even without any makeup and her voice is just a diamond she is really beautiful 💙  I love her💜
Rhianna has a beautiful soul and she didn't deserve what chris Brown did to her anyway the way she screamed because of the lip gloss lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 and the way she did her make up it was Fabulous We should see Rhianna VS James Charles
You are so beautiful natural, you don't need make up

She is beautiful
She is so gorgeous and so sweet and funny.
A beauty
Such a real queen
I love how she brings up her flaws, like her forehead, creases, her nose, her having gained weight, dark circles, and her bags.
you could land a plane on that forehead
Rihanna is fabulous. Fact.

She looks orange
Oh my ALLAH ! She is crazy and cute♥️♥️♥️ I love you so much rihanna . And you ? Okey I know . You love me too ☺️♥️♥️

Hey I have a friend on Facebook that loves Rihanna, his name is tahreek Bolton... I think lol but he would die if he met her. 😲.  He loves rih, as do I. But 4real he would freak if he met her in person, and he's single 🤭 js

I can’t see the different  You are awesome in all ways
Stunning!!!! Love her!!!
I LOVE RIRI. We must protect her happiness and playful personality at all costs <3
I was scared that she didn’t put the foundation down her neck
“I learned to contour when I gained weight.”  *She was never big what?!?!*
No primer? No moisturizer? Interesting.
I'm sorry, but didn't she already have Make-Up on? I Mean at least lipstick.
i don’t know why this is so relaxing to me lel

Her foundation doesn't match her skin tone.

この人美人だな… 英語で何言ってんのかわかんないのがほんとに残念で仕方ない…
"eu vou ser uma baiana eu sou uma baiana".
She's so pretty, i love her! I like her laugh too
Cadê os Br (só vim pelo Diogo paródias, falando nisso CARA é muito estranho ver a voz real da riri...)
Worst thing is that you have to wash it off

She is literally cute
I found out something about Rihanna in this video she has a tattoo on her arm idk how I didn’t know but now I know
She gives me life
I legit wish I had her Cupid’s bow
Out of all of these Vogue videos Rihanna’s is the cutest and most entertaining 😩🙌🏽😍💯❤️
I clicked Like button at .3 second since its Rihanna no regret done
Lovely girl. Keep sparkles ✨ alive
She’s Beautiful 😍🙌
Does anyone know the brand of brushes she used that had the red handle ? :)
James charles who Jeffrey Starr who
No powder setting. It worked, tho! 😌
...and now my face is a different color than my neck!
She is one of the few people who actually started without makeup on, and looked flawless anyway. The rest of the girls thing they was fooling us.
I honestly love Rihanna’s personality XD
Vogue trying to make this some type of make up channel
Rihanna is a QUEEEEEEEEEEN IF YOU DISAGREE THEN I WILL HURT YOU
i suddenly love her . dats it😂💓

8:15🙌💥💥💥 ZEESSSTTT!!!!! I DIED😂😂😂
aii que princesa
First time hearing her talk😋😋😋😋nice soft voice
diva, maravilhosa
Rihanna is beautiful but that was a little to much make up for me
I smiled the entire video I so love her 😍
This is why Rihanna is one of the best
There's no way however she did all this in 10 mins lol some parts of the video when she's applying stuff have been sped up and when she does her lashes has not even been shown... Like it's a cool guide don't get me wrong but is she really claiming you can do all this in 10 mins? Cause that's impossible
RIHANNA😶😍😶😍😍😍😍😍
2019 ANYONE?
Note how when she applied the concealer she said 'It's all right here - THE CURE', and nearly a year later Fenty released their Pro Filt'r Concealer with the logo 'The Cure'... We love a thoughtful QUEEN <3
If Rihanna’s fat than I’m obese
Her forehead is bigger than my future.
The pink eyeshadow looks so good with the color of your eyes💜😍
I love you gurl.
She is so skilled.. 🙌🙌🙌
😍😘😛😁
Elle a die voilà 😉😊😍
When she says it’s a “safe bet” whilst putting on the completely wrong shade of foundation.
Tighten
Woman perfect!!!❤️❤️❤️🖤🖤🖤
Yo sólo se que estoy entré los 20 000000 millones que amamos a está hermosa criatura
Is that a MAC brush that she used for the bronzer?
I love her
what product did she used in her eyes innercorner ???
Aww she’s amazing 😘😍❤️🥰

Twirls in the bathroom fabulous Fat? I think not Hide that forehead Sips ☕ Because I'm black you know what 👃 mean Beach please! 🤣 Ya gotta give her credit for this.... squash those insecurities and love yourself
"Voila"😂😍
Does she seriously not know she needs to blend the foundation down the neck? She owns a makeup company. I can't not see the line.
this was the most entertaining makeup vid, pink really suits u!ty
Quando eu assisto esse vídeo eu só lembro da paródia do Diogo. 😂😂
No one:   Rihanna: “....love, sunset BITCHES!”
what's the lip gloss that she uses? It looks amazing!
what lip gloss she's using?
I can watch dis all dayyy
Wow! She is so cool and down to earth, but where is her Barbados accent. Did she sell out?☹
it will be strange if all her make up is not fenty ...
09:03 je rêve ou elle a dit "voilà" 😂❤️

Ri ri dont need makeup.. Makeup needs her
9:08 this part was a meme
she wore a ton lot of makeup on her face but it looks so real.And yeah she has already got that tanned perfect face so she doesn't really need makeup
Wonder what’s her foundation shade? I’m guessing 320 or 340?? I don’t know
Idc what she says she's naturally beautiful thank you for not ruining your face with plastic surgery.
The way she say "contour" thoo😂
She's pretty
Oh my god she's so cute
Anybody notices that her foundation don’t match her body but it doesn’t matter cuz she’s the queen
Am I the only one that loves Rihanna cause she’s cute and goofy
Why am i watching this i am a male
Rihanna on t'aime!💕💕💕 tu es si naturelle et rayonnante
The gloss colour is mauve
If it doesn't fit in my purse, i changing my purse   I'm imagining LV purse Hermes Birkin, chanel purse 😂
Her foundation is so orange no a offense rihanna im still a fan :)
She’s so adorable. Of all the vogue make up sessions, she’s the most enthusiastic and involved person, out of all of them
I'm never leaving without this in my purse. And if it doesn't fit my purse, then I'm changing my purse lol
Imagine being born this beautiful
i love her ughhh
Them fAt dayssss
She's so sweet and beautiful..I love her face without make up!  Very simple, natural beauty😊
I thought this was ASMR
Omg i love her so much 😍
Her bathroom is amazing
First time I've actually heard her talk 😂. She seems so fun tho x
Love her! She is so cool...and WHAT is that incredible lip gloss???
A great video, so real!
She's so beautiful but her foundation made her very orange
What about make up for really fair skin  ?
Hi rihanna
She should make a video how to have beautyful make up. It is so professional and interesting for every one. I love this
Lindaaa  😍😍
She is a goddess!
Diogo parodias alguém
I am so inlove 🤩😍
I feel close to her 😍😍
Girl: How is your foundation? RiRi: Fine Me: That is soooo wrong foundation color
I love those green eyes
Rihanna doing makeup for movies and TV shows?
Why does she look that stunning with no makeup like omg
Girl, you can put mud and brick dust on that face and it will still be absolutely gorgeous.
صرحه بشعه
She so fun. Love how she gushes everytime she applies the makeup. Lovely 😍✨✨
get it girl I absolutely love this look and loved seeing all the products
i’m not trying to hate at all, i love rihanna, but that foundation is nowhere near her shade...
I just like her for who she's! So beautiful.
does any one know what shade rihanna is ?? (im guessing 330?)
She's really fun. I love her so muchh 😍😍
What’s that gloss she used?!
No soy fan de los tutoriales de make up pero Rihanna es muy iconic y la amo
My god shes so beautiful i start accepting my self and my nose because of her
Ur eyes re amazing
Wow !! ʻO kuʻu akua naniʻO wau ke aloha iāʻoe, aloha wau iāʻoe aloha, aloha, aloha, a me kahanna. ʻaʻohe mea, maikaʻi naniʻole, olaʻole xx
I could watch this for rest of my life   btw is no one going to talk about her voice when she goes deeper and whispers into the mic? No? Just me?
GODDESS
She is adorable 😍😍 Love Riri and look is incredible 😃
Ohh you have picked wrong foundation.its literally yellow.
I wish i had a sister like Rihanna
Her fondation don't match her skin tone, it look like she's wearing a mask
She’s so beautiful without makeup wow! ♥️😍😫
Before afti Love Mak the makes Riana
I am so mad coz this video gets less view than kylie’s one
The undertone of her foundation is too yellow/warm when she has pink/cool undertones. Her contour seemed to match her face, neck and chest more than the foundation did.
ABSOLUTE QWEEN
Queen
I love how genuine she is ... we have the same forehead, so I'm gonna try that contour thing she does and see if it works for me, too.
She is beautiful
Now we going for Dinner :)
That gloss ❤ that shine ❤
I would love to be friends with Riri
that first foundation doesnt match the skin color.  too much yellow tone when her skin is more warm
She just has the cutest personality, it’s so hard not to love her
Hola Bella cómo estás.   Yo bien y tú. Jajajjaajajja
😘💑👌 Hi Rihanna!!!!

That moment when you realize she wasnt wearing makeup before she began.
Pra mim , essa voz dela e uma imitação  e a a voz verdadeira dela e a do diogo paródias
Her face is soooooo orange
What lipgloss is she using help a sister out I NEED it

Her personality, is goal.
the foundation oxidises. spoiler for anyone wondering why her foundation looks different then her skin.
مكياج الريحاني الخطير والله لو بتشوف المقطع العربي المدبلج بتستقيلين😂😂😂😂💔
That highlighter shines bright like a diamond

It helps to start off looking like THAT though!😁
Her intro was so cute❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rihanna: because im black you know i have a special nose   Me: 😒😒😒😒😒
Which body lava is this?
Wow Caitlyn Jenner Looks Amazing IN This Video.
I dont know why, but when I saw her, in my mind came two thoughts: Gamora and Wakanda
Www.soundcloud.com/mrnostereo
Hey beautiful Rihana
Anybody else love her laugh? Like it’s seriously whenever I laugh I sound like a chocking donkey, yet honestly her laugh is perfect!
VIOLAAAA
She's so funny ♥️
She's crazy I love her
I love the fact that all the American people accept their skin color
Haha 😼 Been Doing This Since We Was Little.  40 - 45 Minute Showers.  One In The Books For The Chasers ... #DC #Young Money #Ain'tNoGloGang
Ri Ri -  Highlight my nose bridge..BOOM Me:* drops biscuits *
Somebody please help me understand, if you put concealer on your eyebags then why would you put a darker shadow on it? I mean you were trying to brighten up your eyes, right?  (Help me understand, I dont actually know how to do make up. Thanks)
Vim pelo Diogo Paródias huabauajauauaauauaha
This is just so cute like honestly😍😘
summer,sunset,love,drama and....... BITCHES
"to hide under eye bags,hangovers,BAD DECISIONS!"
I love you so much!👑👑👑👑👑
Cuteee!
Start withe the Jaundace look.....😋
Que hermosa Chocolat girl
Prefiro Diogo Paródias kskskzk
The coolest video <3
Did u see that ?? She don't need setting  spray for her makeup, others just take shower with the spray 🙄
When she smiled while applying the blush I smiled too 😄 I just love her
大好き😍
So... I looked on Fentybeauty.com... I couldn't find a Rihanna in stock :( they stopped selling it after she was too awesome
He ascetic is nice pink but the red nails just bug me
The background people just laugh at everything.  Definitely fake
She's so exquisite💞💞💞💞
Okay ngl that doesn't look like her shade
I never thought rihanna would act like this..I mean she is so bubbly😍😍
_Rhianna_ "hide that double chin  _me_ *im offended*
Concealer for hiding bags, dark circles, hangovers and BAD DECISIONS!! Hahaha
Beautiful Rhianna Fenty
Makeup needs Rihanna
Rihanna linda! Antes de se maquiar já estava incrível!
Step 1: be beautiful
She should do ASMR
Olha essa CASA!
0:19 well that's rude
Is that a hickey?
rihanna is so relatable tbh
If BEYONCÉ will do make up by herself, I will die!!!!!!!!!
Ok but which lipgloss is thattt??
foundation for women with cirrhosis of the liver.  She does makeup without a mirror? Doesn't she see what her complexion is? he is Yellow! Rihanna Simpson))).
How can you NOT love Rihanna?
Oh God u look so beautiful honey 😩💖
💕💕💕🥰
I actually have almost everything she used in this video except for the lip glass and the body lava.
Whats the nome of the gloss she used?
Tbh she looks better without makeup (AND LOOKS EVEN BETTER WITH A SHADE THAT MATCHES HER SKINTONE)
Cantik bet
I love Rihanna shes a legit genuine person and i love her personality she dosent let her fame get to her
When i put that much pink colours on my face I look like Barbie...I wish I had darker skin😭
Rihanna is so freaking HAWT and BEAUTIFUL.
Amo tanto ❤️
Instagram @_do__ve _ 🇮🇹
I feel you on the under eye creases no matter what I use they are still there it's maddening. Any tips anyone?
I cant get over how beautiful Rihanna is
❤️
Someone leak her skin care routine
Beautiful look, beautiful woman... but nobody is gonna say it? Rihanna made a foundation line with like 50 shades and undertones for everyone and she uses the wrong undertone for herself😫... I cringe when people do that but not Rihanna because the makeup still looked amazing... *putting some fenty on my wishlist* 😻
I wish she’ll release more body lava
She’s so pretty 😭😭😭
God i love this video 😍😍😍😍😍😍👸👸
Rihanna, you rocked there :)
That's my wife man #foreheadgang 😨❤
10:15 I hope you enjoyed my tutorial...cuz I'm done!hahah that was cute!
Fivehead gang

Queen👸🏾
If it doesn't fit in my purse, I change my purse =]]
5:42
I love u Rihanna  keep shining bright like a diamond<3.
I actually wanted to see how she does her brows so natural...
I wish she would of shown how she does her  eyebrows
Q.U.E.E.N
She is an icon! 😍
8:54
แม่รอฟังเพลงใหม่แม่ยุนะ
i think the self-esteem of a little girl dies a little every time a healthy sized person says the words "I look fat"
😂😅😂😅💀💀💀 she is hilarious
She does not need makeup she is so beautiful already!!!

It’s basically a Fenty Beauty promo 😜😜
8:43 rip headphone users

“Sunset... summer.. love.. drama.. BITches!” -Rihanna
Thank you for helping me with my passport photos girl! xoxo <3

Why it’s so yellow this foundation it doesn’t match her skin color

Magnifique ! Mais le fond de teint c'est pas la bonne teinte x)
Só parei aqui por causa do *DIOGO PARÓDIAS* 😂♥
Dark skin is unique
Okay, i love her.. 😍
this would only be epic if she had eczema or something.... being flawless already, and then needlessly putting makeup on? not epic lol blessed maybe, but not epic.
She seem soo down to earth
*so I just fell in love with rihanna once again*

Wow...you look gorgeous...but your foundation colour is a little bit too yellow for you..  dont you think??? The eyeshadow colours are stunning!!
2019??!
You don't have a special nose, I'm black and a love my nose so no make up for my nose.
"It's a bit messy but I can handle that" aka me and my life.
Start of with foundation. Then contour (four head,cheeks) Blend in the contour good
The dislikes are pimples
I’m a grown man and I watch this video nearly every god damm day .. RiRi is freakin’ fire 🔥 💖
What the body shimmer and lip product?
Her foundation doesn’t really match at all
DIOGO PARÓDIAS TO COM A SUA VOZ NA MENTE
Her Fondoution is not her colour
Bgm song ?
Rihanna doesn't need ANY MAKEUP. SHE IS BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT IT.
what lipstick is that ??? it’s so pretty i want it
*James Charles has left the chat!*
Rihanna: "everybody knows concealer is made for hiding bags,  and dark circles... and  hang overs... and bad decisions" guUuuuuUuurrRrrrl
I have been in love with this lady since I was 12, now I'm 19 and I still have a crush on her ♡
Forever my in my top 3 of my favorite women
*No I Look Fat* lol im fatter
She's like the Bob Ross of makeup
Kitty you good pop singer but i want Tell you goodbye my is finish this cuiside

"I look kinda cute..."  Rhianna honey!  I can't!

Because it says summer, sunset, love, drama, BITCHES 😂😂
Классная малая, только что-то располнела...

Kkkk Eu só consigo lembrar do Diogo paródias
I love how amazed she was by her own products
"this is a little messy right now, but i'll handle that" a mood (that i should actually follow)
which highlighter did she use on her shoulders?
Esta hermosa, pero su bases debe ser morada no amarilla, porque no es una blanca blonceada🙊
you look beautiful, i love you !!!
2019??
Cute.
The voice of rihanna talking. I feel like watching ak ASMR video. Love it
❤️❤️❤️
so satisfying when she started blending the body lava
Beautiful Riri!💋
The foundation shade is wrong for her
beauty gurus are *Q U A K I N G*
my skin isnt even half as good
If she can’t find her own color and she owns a makeup company ummmmmmm
She has no friends REALLY that color looks orange on her and her face color doesn’t match her neck!!
and more
woow
Beauty queen,   and what was that! LOved the make up!
STUNNING. WITH OR WITHOUT MAKEUP, JUST *STUNNING!*
she is sooooo gorg💓
beautiful even without make up
she's so real 😲 i love her
Riri is so cute
Summer,sunset,love,drama.       BITCHES
Her voice is so relaxing!💓
Urghh, she's so beautiful even w/o make up 😫💓
“Love, drama, bitches” 😂
THE BEST
so gorgeeeeeous
She’s crazy beautiful, but I wish she hadn’t skipped over how the brows and  mascara were done, both are usually perfection.
remember that
Ac in the bathroom are u serious
I feel like her contour is a better foundation match
Rihanna please give me a shout out im KJ/Katie Jules
Love her ❤️
I’m pretty sure everyone can see her going on her tip toes when she gets excited about her makeup and her day and her mood it’s so adorable
“Then fat days and you got baby cheeks “ girl u r the definition of icon and beauty u don’t need make up we need a collar w/ Jeffree Star
Okay im loving now my wide forehead just bec riri has it too. I love her
she's weird
She looks like my little cousin, cute
"O QUE EU QUERO ? EU QUEROO.... PAAAAUMMM"
I love Rihanna but am I the only one who noticed that her foundation doesn’t match her skin tone?
y shes soooo cutee😩❤❤
Her foundation is nooooooot the right shade.
Rihanna is perfection❤❤❤❤
Prefiro o dublado kkkkkkkkkkkkk
My mom barely let me start doing makeup and I went to safora and they automatically took me to the mirror and gave me Fenty. On the first try I fell in love. Then I met my aunt at Starbucks and she she said my skin looked nice and I told her I had foundation on. She ran to safora with me and got an entire makeup collection of Fenty. I love that Riannah thought about every thing when she designed her amazing makeup collection
She doesn't need make up.
PERFECT  NO DEFECTS ♥
The reason why I love Rihanna "She's real and not plastic"
U know they don't have fenty beauty products at the ulta in Hawaii, kapolei.  But they have Kylie Jenner lip kits and kkw fragrence!
Has Fenty released a Bronzer?
I love her
"I look fat".....uh huh huh,  you do have fat fans too...who get you views & shmoney....😂😂😂😂😂...."who I'm gonna see", her songs ain't lying 😂😂😂😂😂..#iLoveIt!!!!
I love you riri 😍😘😘😘🦄🌌
Highlight of my life just like the fenty beauty kit 🎶
A queen
When people ask me why I love Rihanna,  I show them this
THIS IS WHY WE ALL LOVE RHINNA
That bronzer bottle wanted to do you wrong 🤣🤣🤣
How many takes Rihanna, just let us know hahahaha
*Quem ai veio pelo video do Diego Paródias??*
What is the last thing she used for her shoulders? Please somebody tell me!
girl !  even when Im Trying to hate Her I can't ! she just pulls me back in with her eyes , Don't Know what kind of Vodoo magic she got but she makes me want to watch her ALL THE TIME !
Applying concealer: To hide bad  decisions HAHA
You pretty all ready 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
What exact lip gloss did she use? I can’t tell!
Wonderful Rihanna❤️
e o povo pensou que eu já tava maquiada
Her face n neck doesn't look equal.. Shadewise.bt tutorial is gud

Riri dont have a double chin
You know what I love myself even though I look like a burnt chicken nugget I still love myself
Hide That Double Chin. hahah
We lovr RiRi
She looks stunning but one question. Why is she using a foundation and does not match her skin tone? Surely as someone who has the biggest collection of colours she would use the correct one on herself?
Barbados,i want to do New Babylon with rainbow stripes and a pitchfork.
I gotta rihanna ad in a rihanna video

What's her line like fr white women? I haven't tried it yet just wondering if any one knows, thanks.
I really feel like Rihanna is the only celebrity who actually knows how to do her makeup, like even other celebrities with makeup lines have no idea what they're doing but here's the goddess out here really TEACHING I love her
8:42 😂😂😂😂💘💘
She is soo pretty! UGH! <3
No joke when the video started I was like “ doesn’t she already have makeup on?”
Rihanna needs to do some ASMR
She is flawless
Flawless!!!

SHE DON'T NEED MAKEUP SHE IS BEAUTIFUL!
Love that eye color

She used a lighter base than her skin !!!
“cause i got a huge forehead” i felt that
Wow Makeup can really do amazing things to a face. It’s an art. And yes a lot of self-practice. She’s spunky I like that. Haha she seems bit drunk towards the end
She doesn’t need makeup 😍😍
Gorgeous women 😍😍 I don't think I can be myself when the ppl looking at me doing my makeup behind the scenes
Ok we understood it you like glowing! I think you can't hide it anyway!😂

Esse vídeo não é o mesmo sem a voz do Diogo paródias 😂😂😂😂
I like you, but here you look drunk or drugged.

The makeup is 😍😍😍 but it’s informative and adorable
I am a big fan of u i love how u do your makeup ♥️
She is most beautiful  than kyile love love
*no I look fat-*
I didn't know riri can be as  cute as her rn. 😍😍
What she needs to do is make some type of fenty skincare cuz her skin be lookin bomb
Where did her accent go ??
Has 50 shades of foundation.. n yet she choose the wrong shade
i love you RiRi❤️❤️❤️
She s so beautiful without make up too!!!
You should blend your foundation with a brush. The product won‘t "stick" in the beautyblender. So, you don‘t have to buy make up "every" 2-3 weeks😂😂👍🏻 The conceaer also but it dependa on the person too.😊BUT I really like your make up❤️❤️
She’s got a real funny looking forehead and quite an alienesque face... amazing what make up can do thou even ugly can be made beautiful. Rihanna has a great body shame about the face thou
Que linda meu Deus ❤️
When you did these things, you suddenly understand you are not Rihanna...
I love her Rihanna looks and how she isnt afraid to show that no one need plastic surgeries or fillers to look good. Just look at her OMGG
Цвет лица сильно отличается от всего кожного покрова.
Diogo paródias

I love how every comments qouted her words and got thousands of likes - 2019
I need more Rihanna
She's Yellow !!!!
She has a very soothing voice and she applied that makeup like a pro.  I wish I could have her fix my face before a night out.
Linda pode crê q vou fazer mais não vai ficar tão boa quanto a sua !sua linda
What shade is Rihanna in Fenty foundation
she didnt use primer and that irritated me sooo much!!!!
I could just stare at her for hours and never get bored, she's magic on camera, id love to see more of her in this way. So relatable😀
terrible.
2019, anyone??
She seems so nice and down to earth in this video
You don't even need Makeup hah 😅❤

RiRi does better makeup than Kim K

Haven’t rihanna made a racist gestures?
EU SOU A BAIHANNAAAAA

No sé... pero es un quilombo ser mujer!
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
“Beach please..Beach please!! Get it? ....yeah” RELATING RIGHT NOW
She's so weird and full of herself. And probably drunk too. Even her makeup is done in an illuminati way. Go wash your eyes before it infects your brain  RÉPONDRE
I love how she’s not shoving her brand in your face she just being relatable
5:47 I'm watching with my parents 😭😂😢
Yass

Do she really need makeup? No i don't think so..she is already a goddess of beauty
Amooo ela e linda e aqui no Brasil as blogueiras com cara de reboque kkkk
Rihanna com certeza deveria fazer mais vídeozinhos desse porque MEU DEUS MARAVILHOSO só faltou começar o vídeo com "Olá meninas tudo bom??"
リアーナ大好き

The best ten minutes of my life.
Rihanna is my spirit animal goshhhh
what’s the background music called?
She is soooo gorgeous! But, I feel like this foundation color is not a match for her....no??? It's just too light/orangey for her complexion, to me. Maybe it's the lighting or something. Regardless, she is stunning!!! STUNNING!!!! Love Rhianna & Vogue!!! Yasssss!!! 💋❤️💋❤️💋❤️💋
Vogue chama a Laura Brito para fazer uma make
EU SOU A BAIANNA

Wow she is beautiful I want to loom like her 😭😍😍😍😍
The foundation doesnt match the neck tho T_T
That’s my girl so confident and lovely
How can a human being be so humble and perfect 👌
There should be Leigh-Anne there
That is not Rihanna’s colour
When you see her songs she has a different voice and personality but in real life shes shy 👍🏻
Love u babe
So I completely LOVE RiRi ❤️💯 but I must say.. I’m using her fenty foundation and lipstick right now and it’s not exactly what I thought it would be .. the foundation is ehh.. it just doesn’t cover and the lipstick runs so badly . It gets everywhere . Idk I just figured $45 foundation and $25 lipstick would be a little better
guuuurl riri could you drop 1,2 albums this year. we miss you i am talking about those like me who dont really makeup. ^^
she is the most beautiful woman on the Earth❤
omg, for all tutorials that i watched since last 5 years, rihanna's tutorial makes my life more easier. maybe im not into drag make up thing. i like minimal or half way of it. but this time it makes a lot more sense. thanks Riri!!! you are indeed a #badgal!!!:)
Super beautiful
can someone tell me what lipgloss she has on
I like the fact that she's so playful😂😂
♡
Vim pelo Diogo Paródias e seus Segredos de Beleza
the loml
A cabeça dela é muito grande kkkkkkk  Que nervoso. Makelinda rs
Rihanna looks like she would be such a fun friend
Before she put the make up on her skin still looked flawless
Love her, love the video, love the makeup BUT that foundation is not her shade:(
Oo wow her face color is different then her body
I would like to know the brushes that she’s using in this video. I’ve recognized her Fenty Beauty brushes but how about the other ones??? Anyone, please???!!!

"I learned how to contour when I gained weight" since when Rihanna gain weight?? I've always seen her as a skinny legend! She's such a queen!!
"Diogo paródias".
7:26 That would be my reaction too if I would put on Fanty Beauty MakeUp 😂
I think that her foundation is too yellow.....BUT I LOVE HER BECAUSE SHE IS AN ICON AND A VERY STRONG WOMAN VERY BEATYFUL AND PRETTY WOMAN
Que guapa Rihanna
Her heart shaped lips and green eyes ♥️♥️
love her! i wanted to see the brows tho
I don't know why people love Rihanna and hate Kylie??? Why give me a reason
40 shades of her Fenty foundation and she choose bad shade for herself...
Cutest goddess😍

Wait a minute she was doing her concealer and I’m the end she said “ all right here the cure and if u didn’t know she’s launching a concealer named THE CURE crap she gave us hints  2:50

9:14 her face when she's pumping the Body Lava is such a mood XD
I love that she points out small blemishes and doesn't hide the fact that she has them. This honesty along with her goofy personality is what needs to be shown more often in the world.

Can someone tell me what shade she is using for her foundation
God, I didn't think I could love her more. She's so down to earth. <3
Disgusting 🤮🤮
So beautiful ☺
უმაკიაჟოდაც დზაან ლამაზია
You should make your foundation slightly darker and less warm because there was a harsh line between your face and neck
Omg that highlighter is sooo bright
Couldnt stop replaying the intro
0:04 *Hit or miss*
She is the coolest person in the entire world 😎
What double chin?
Rih Rih my beauty queen   But who else agrees that Rih Rih has a red undertone but the foundation is too yellow  While for me I have a yellow undertone and my foundation is a little too red
I love her original skin colour
Riri gaining weight? Impossible, she is only curvy and gorgeous. No in between.
Rihanna being such a Virgo, a perfectionist at heart ♍️❤️ yasss virgooooossss
Do she still sing ?
All I can say is I FREAKIN LOVE HER!
She is the Only one I will sit still n watch re makeup
love you riri so much
I loveeee riri
Love this so muchhh
There's no way I would sit here and watch a woman apply make up but when it's Rihanna.  Hey all bets are off
I really like her, my girl
“See that aaAaAHhHhhh” “Oohhh zEst or ooOoOfFff” “Im kinda cute “ Lines of a comedian gorgeous queen
She is sooooo iconic! Love u gurl!
Linda😘💕

**whispers** Because I am black ya know..very special nose" lol
Maravilhosa! ❤️
she’s so funny and beautiful like omfg❤️
she owns my heart
You always think that celebrities are super divas in real life and this is proof that that's not true
Her voice is everything
This fundation is yellow
“Nah I look fat...”       DAFUQ RIRI U PERFECT GAL LOVE HER  U slayyyy queeeennnnnnn
I’m changing my purse, shook.
Diva Love.
oh god how I adore her voice
Love ur music  Good vid  Go riri
God she’s flawless
Rihanna is so gorgeous👍😘
She’s losing her accent
Chi é qui per il video di Cosma? Hahaha
I heard you are going to do 10 more shades of foundation, but only dark. Im really really happy for POC, but I have to say that my white af face doesnt have a good match in your amazing foundation (and that means same for concealers). Shade 100 is tiny too light and too neutral (i have yellow undertones so i look like im sick in it) and shade 120 is just too dark :c  Please consider
I had no idea rihanna was personally doing YouTube videos.
ya know what im sayin' -arceo hahahaha yo
она и без макияжа очень  красивая😙😍
さいこう
Iiiiiiiiii💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💋💗💗💗💗💗💜💙
She's funny💛
Rihanna is the best all the makeup gurus are shaking
Superrr
Rihanna just sold me on Fenty!  I'm going to try everything she just used on my dark skin.
Natural Beaty!
For some reason I wanna kiss her forehead 😍😍😘😘
She is beautiful without makeup too.

"I likr to do the the corner of my eyes cause it gives you a little hooohh or umphhh as some people like to call it" we stannnn

"More is more" poetic ✨
The beginning of the video 😂😂😂 I love you Rihanna💓🌹

I feel like she used the wrong tone for her foundation
SERIOUSLY WHAT LIP GLOSS IS SHE WEARING???

“I learned how to contour when I gained weight”😂😂😂

Orange face.
Aquele momento que você não está preparado para a voz normal dela de tanto ver os vídeos do diogo parodias

Has own makeup brand and doesn’t know how to shade match her foundation?? Well, I guess she did seem very drunk, or something.
Idk why but for some reason she sorta reminds me of Gina rodriguez
Rihanna=sexy & cute I  love you!

“U know what im sayyn” “Yehss”

You remind me of my mom, my mom is amazing.
Eu quero Pão

Her personality is relatable like she is a real person ...  Lol.
"Because concealer is made to hide bags,dark circles and bad decisions " that's relatable
You are sweet
What did she use for the corner of the eye ???😱
Why is there 9.1k dislikes on this video
1:22😂😂

Love her forehead❤️
Ugh I really wanted to see her do her brows 😭
Rihanna is so pretty😍😊. Like yasss honey👑👑

Channeling  coco Montrese realness
Literally the first video I’ve seen of Rihanna.. I wanted to see what she’s like, you know?   UGH, I could watch these forever! She’s like a friend!
I don’t like that the Queen of matching foundations is NOT matching her own foundation 😞  Still love her tho❤️
What's the lip gloss called?
I thought her natural skin looked better
Is it just me, but her foundation does match her neck🤷🏽‍♀️
Vim pelo Diogo parodias kkkkkjjjj
She's so beautiful. 😍
Trump?!?!
اكو عرب بالطيارة
Does anyone know what product she uses at 8:10 to highlight the inner corner of her eyes? I LOVE IT. Is it a lip gloss??

I always passed over this video, but I am TRULY AMAZED by how good she did. Wow. And to think, years ago I had no idea I was in an elevator with her 🤦🏽‍♀️
Ri Ri so cuuute! she just keeps it real
This lip is everything. I see why her entire line sold out here in Atlanta the first week it launched. I don’t wear a lot of Makeup but I love love love this lipstick. The body makeup is super cute  too for summer.
Thank u,4:26
someone please tell me what lipgloss that is😭😍
She was putting on her make up like it wasn’t her makeup line lol! Omg I neeeed some Fenty Beauty!!!!
Riri a Pisces 😃 no surprise she is so down to earth. Love the energy she puts into her makeup....those dislikes are obviously haters...we all know who by😂
Shes beatiful
I come back to this video every couple of months...I don’t even wear makeup, I’m just here for Rihanna! ❤️❤️❤️
"Você sabe o que eu quero, eu quero PÃO"
Ela é uma das únicas pessoas que não muda nada se tiver maquiada ou não!
Am I the only one that thinks the foundation was too yellow? 🧐

LOVEEEEEE💜 RI!👏🏾😍
Me encanta revise los precios del maquillaje y jamas podria pagarlo :/

Vim pelo diogo parodias
can u please be my grandma
Hahaha maravilhosaa 💖
Wow!That’s a lot of makeup! Before you applied all that makeup, you looked beautiful. The makeup enhanced your beauty somewhat, but honestly I don’t see the total benefit in wearing that much makeup for a person that already has natural beauty. For a photo shoot, broadway, red carpet, etc., yes.
Rihanna with the head oo🏃🎼🎵🎶
James Charles and manny mua are quaking
She is so bubbly and cute ❤️
Rhianna rolls into camera frame  Rhianna: No I look fat
"always in my purse and if it doesn't fit in my purse.... then im changing my purse" i died HAAHAH
god i love her
perfect <3
your makeup is too orange.. orange face, brown neck, not pretty
2:15 - 2:18 *me when I’m doing my homework*
so pretty!
You didn't have to do this Rihanna, but you did. 💋
What! This is to cute for her to keep it real with us like this. Thanks Re Re
Rihanna's speaking voice and eyes reminds me A LOT of Zara Larsson, it's impressive :O
PÃO!
Tbh I don’t think she really needs makeup she’s beautiful without it     👇🏼PLz like
No one loves Rihanna's products more than Rihanna like, she's literally surprised at how amazing they are

You shouldn't have even put on cover up. You look yellow asf.💀
OH YEAAAH QUEEN

Now I’m using foundation in shade BANANA YELLOW
Rihanna:“Hide that double chin”  Me: What double chin?

Eu amo uma mulher!
Too orange foundation? Why?
Beautiful
Rihanna is extremely gorgeous & graceful!!!! She is indeed a beauty!!!!! I love her!!!!!
Plastic surgery can really change someone's physical features. And also skin bleaching
She really sounds like Bobbi Kristina brown in this videop
I love u Rihanna ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Super cute and strong Lady at the same time love you rihanna you don't behave like celeb at all
I love her raspy voice
Love this video: no false lashes,no super dark- super big eyebrows...just natural with a little bit of makeup...
Eu fiquei admirando a cor da boca dela natural, jesuss que mulher
"It says summer, sunset, lover, drama, BITCHES"
I want her to kick me in the face.
Kween
Her foundation doesn't match
"eu sou uma baiana, eu sou uma baiana"!!
ESSA VOZ NN É DELA NN PODE TIRAR BOTA ESSA VOZ DIREITO DIOGO!!!!!
Wow i dont even have the most important thing that i needed . I needed concealer because i have really dark circles under my eyes and tbh i feel like it makes me look older. I did have insomnia when i was younger so that could be why but i dont have it anymore so im trying to get  more sleep but i dont feel like it’s exactly helping getting rid of my dark circles
Bella Hadid's video was better ,I don't like the contour trend of make-up, this is too much makeup
"concealer hides bad decisions" 😂😂😂
É muito maravilhosa mesmo! 😍😍😍
She's so adorably! I love her!
When Rihanna says she has a double chin  Honey no
Eu não consigo assistir esse vídeo sem lembrar da dublagem do Diogo Paródias kkkk
PÃO!

Почему тональный крем так отличается от её настоящего цвета кожи? Она что ли не видит, что он ЖЁЛТЫЙ?

Absolutely gorgeous and such an amazing personality! * But I think her undertone is not as yellow as the foundation she used, I think it's more red. Her face was yellowy and her body was redish, other than that, amazing! <3
я не люблю её за то что она шлюха. увидев её клипы🤮 все женьщины красивы если будет уход

Omg she is so cute😍😍 I don't know why when ever I see her she makes me surprise😱
What’s that lipgloss she uses??😱
the beginning is me when the person is taking too long to pick up a facetime call
I honestly thought she was wearing makeup in the beginning
Rihanna is so funny 😂😂😛

Q Qu Que Quee  Queen Quee Que Qu Q
I love how she normalises the flaws (though i dont see any) that she has to make the girls out there feel less insecure :')))) i love her.
I could seriously watch her butchering puppies and still drool.
No,I look fat😂😂😂😂.   Rihanna don’t look fat she’s body shaming herself but she’s a skinny legend. It to fat or to skinny just right
Rihanna is so REAL
Cover up colour don’t go with her skin little it nice but doesn’t with the face I saw her skin colour not to much with the other no
What did she use in 9:17 ¿¿ 😻
She would be an amazing ASMRtist
Hasta las mujeres mas hermosas en todo sentido tienen sus inseguridades como al principio dijo que se miraba gorda jajajaja DAMNMMMM RIRI U R SO FUCKIN PRECIOUS
Perfeita sem erros
Wait but she doesn’t NEED makeup.

Okay, Rihanna has a sense of humour. I like her more.
How much you are funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😍😍😍😍😍i love ya
Rihanna invented the body lava 😂

9:25 the body lava challenge
I don't like her anymore...shes lame
Just teach how to be this stunning pls

In my opinion Rihanna is soooo much better than Kylie

She isn’t fat, She is so Normal ❤️
Rihanna is so down to earth!! I love her so much!!

Epic! 🤘Rihanna is so lovely, she came out and greeted fans in our video.
Tbh i love rihanna's forehead. Idk but it really makes her more attractive and make her stand out in a good way!
Rihanna carries an exotic layer of makeup which completely suits her dark skin tone.... definitely the video uncovers some of her beauty secrets.. must see
To be honest i can listen to her talk for hours cause i just lover her voice and that bit of an accent she has
“Because it says summer sunset love drama BITCHES”.😂😂Love her Omg
She’s actually pretty good
foundation doesn’t really match her skin tone..
She looks like a doll 😍
Рианна каайф,аххх целую ее в носик.
rihanna: **screams** me:  me: QUEEN
Essential Realness
I miss her Barbados accent :/  Also is it me or her foundation looks too warm for her
*summer, sunset, love, drama, BITCHES.*
Love,summer, sunset bitch's 😂
I love her voiceee
lol youre so corny
You have to love Rihanna... She's so pretty and cute, but also a badass!
I THOUGHT SHE WAS WEARING MAKEUP IN THE INTRO

She looks so beautiful   With make up _ bold  Without make up _ cute 😂
AC in her bathroom??
Love you so much ri

Wait I thought she already done the make up in the beginning of the video and then I realised this woman is just perfect
I love how natural you are!
HUUU, O QUE É QUE EU QUERO?  EU QUERO... PÃO!
She's such a vibe!
YAS RIHANNA

kylie is waaaayyy better
....and the name of products so???
Caribbean barbie, you're so stunning. Your eyes and smile can just bright up a room!!!
She made her face lighter than her neck/body

YASSS QWEEN!!
Gosh you're so stunning, you don't even need the makeup. You came out and I thought "Wow - beauty"
So much of makeup 😣😣don't get me wrong it's nice but doesn't your face feel hot or to warm with that much makeup

We’re going to the clurb 💀😂
Riri is like our generation's Aaliyah. What a princess ❤
Y’all know what brush set she has? Or what are some good brushes that aren’t crazy expensive? I’m suffering.
quem veio pelo diogo parodias
“No I look fat” 😂 love her
Rihanna FORGOT the POWDER , its Rihanna , she got no rules <3 hahahahah
SHE IS SOOOO ADORABLE OMG 😍😍😍😍
Does anyone know what lip gloss she used?? 🤔
Rihanna is so beautiful. I want to be beautiful
*I know that no one will care but I covered "Stay" by Rihanna and few more songs. I hope you can check it out and let me know what you think :) and if you subscribe I would be one step closer to my dreams!*
I'm offended, i've been clickbaited by this video, in the title it clearly says '10-Minute' check how long this video is, 10:28, truly disgusting.
Rihanna and her makeup geniuses!!! and i love it because she does neutral looks but can really beat TF out of anyones face and you'd never expect it
Rihanna is so hilarious 😆
Quennnnnn
What.   A.     Freaking.     Queen.
Dis is literally legendary.
That was really fun to watch. Love her reactions.
How is it that this flawless drop dead gorgeous human being doing her make up feels sooo relatable to someone who never wears makeup
Which product is better   Huda Beauty  Fenty Beauty   Comment below
She is so cute
I love it when she says CUNTour
amo demais essa nega.  <3
ThE BlEnD Is ReAl !
She is in Barbados for this tutorial.  Her personality is so chill.
her voice is soo soothing
Which is the lipgloss that she uses?
Just one of those ladies where the internal beauty shines or stands out more more than the physical beauty.  Considering that her physical beauty is rather stunning ... the personality of a goddess.
Wow you look beautiful
she looks so prettyyyy with and without
- Eu quero.... PÃO 😂
not gonna lie i bought her contour sticks after this video
I swear Rihanna is so cute
I love how she says contour 💖

People should be buying Fenty rather than KKW because, obviously it’s so much better than Kylie’s brand and it’s actually so much better quality.
ICONIC

I thought she was in full glam and then she was like "let's add some foundation" then it clicked she wasn't wearing any like HOW 😭😭😭
when she’s not talking, she has that cold aura that makes her kinda unapproachable but when she does talk, she’s so adorably cute! this is why people loveeee her
Why is she so gorgeous without makeup?! Can I plz be like that?
http://karenstardust.blogger.hu/ all about stars and famous!:) Rihanna , Giselle Bündchen news!:)

Почему афроамериканки так любят рыжий (оранжевый) тон ?
I love how she didn't brag about her makeup brand and didn't tell us to buy her products one time........QUEEN!!!
Why am I seeing this only now??? 😂😂😂
Rihanna favors Whitney Houston ❤️
Rihanna just took #1 spot for all these Vogue beauty moments <3

❤❤❤❤💋💋💋🇧🇷
SHES SUCH A QUEEN I LOVE HER CRAP
Can I be her best friend
She’s such a mood
The foundation is to yellow for her she dont neet makeup!
Love Rihanna so much  but gal has a makeup range with 40 foundation shades but still hasn’t found her right one 🤔🤔🤔 Still luv herrr💖💖
I feel like her foundation is not her skin color
I could watch her forever this is so calming
She looks so human Im so impressed
Is she sure that she picked the right shade for her foundation?
I love her personality, she's so beautiful, funny and awesome 😍 Queen Riri
4th time watching
elle a les bon gestes, sans conteste, mais son choix de fond de teint est désastreux. bien trop jaune pour elle. alors qu'elle a une très jolie carnation. la démarcation visage/cou est bien trop évidente. c'est pas beau du tout, bouh! allez, choisi ton fond de teint à ta vraie couleur, et tu seras parfaite! she has the right gestures, without question, but her choice of foundation is disastrous. far too yellow for her. while she has a very pretty complexion. the demarcation face/neck is far too obvious. it's not beautiful at all, booh! go, choose your foundation to your true color, and you will be perfect!
I love the look but the foundation looks more orange than your natural tone. Cause your natural tone is orangish, but the foundation just makes it more vivid.
Why are you so beautiful inside and out babe 😍❤️
I honestly thought she was wearing natural makeup at the start
Abla efsanesin yemin ederim🇹🇷
Does anyone know what lip gloss shes using?
What font is used in the intro?
anyone just like wanna be rihanna like for real? she’s just the best💕👏🏻
Riri💜💜💜 just love her...
*double chin...where?*
She needs to start a YouTube channel and make vlogs and just be her adorable  self
I love you rihanna ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m literally so in love with her makeup line I will never use anything else it’s perfect 😩
That foundation wasn’t her shade but it turn out good         Yess ri ri
I love her personality☺️
Omg the intro ahahahaha

Uh... I think she used the wrong foundation shade? The foundation she used was a little too saturated, a slight bit orange. Nonetheless, flawless and slaying as ever.
Where's her YouTube channel
“Agora eu sou uma baiana eu quero ser uma baiana.”
Ohhhh,I ❤️ her so much so pretty
Love it!
Rihanna being relatable for 10minutes
I’m waiting for Rihanna to start up a YouTube channel with just her, a camera and her funny personality
Cutest person ever 😍😍😍
She has an off the chain personality!  Wow!  Makeup well done girl!
I wonder what she looks like without make up hmmm  https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/2806681  What would Gordon Ramsay say.  “God awful”

Oh yeah, Riri Queen bitches
She slays but cute at the same time 💞💞💞
it looks a bit too yellow in my opinion, i like her natural skin tone tho :( She doesnt need any makeup at all tbh
She's beautiful without makeup.... At the beginning I thought she was wearing makeup
She just doesn’t need that makeup !! I’m screaming xnxnxnxn
Honestly she could do her make up with a pack of sharpies and she would still look flawless
She does not need makeup but I do feel if she is she should have used primer first but that is just my opinion. I love Rihanna
She’s soooooooo cute
Beautiful just beautiful ♥️♥️♥️🔥 🔥♥️

*10 MINUTES worth of proof that Rihanna is a queen*
Yellow. YELLOW. Anyone??!
if she did an asmr video I could die happy....her accent is so pretty I could listen to her read a phone book for hours
She’s so gorgeous I can’t deal with herrrrr
did it annoy anyone else that she was always to the right of the screan?
I love you soo much Rihanna and I am Beyza
Hi *shhhhh*
l o v e     t h i s
I want to park my truck on the forehead
I jus love her
çağla dan geldik 😁
Love you Rihanna! Keep it real baby!
I couldn’t tell the difference.. you look amazing!!!!!!!♥️
I don't mean to hate but the foundation shade is not for you girl  :(  Maybe the lights in the room made it difficult to find the right shade
Her skin has a pink undertone (maybe due to the sunburn she said she had) but her foundation is too yellow/orange for her skin here. This color probably looks better when she isn’t sunburned giving that “pinker” look. Still a beauty.
Chuck it !!!!makeup=RIHANNA FAME
Why the foundation is so yellow?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsQGXNOFN0s&t=8s  Rihanna&Fenty Beauty Turkey

Tha queen: HI shshshsh hi Me: Thats me when I talk ahahah
Is it just me or did she look way better without makeup? Now she just looks sweaty and shiny with that highlight. That foundation is too yellow. Idk I think she looks better when she first started the video
I wanna see Ariana Grande do her makeup

7:23 I love her
I DIDNT KNOW SHE WORE MAKEUP!! Like queeeeennnn
I noticed that Riri often puts her hair behind her ear. Is that because of her forehead? Because I do that too and my head is colossal 😂
"concealers are nade for ..... BAD DECISIONS!😍"
She's so pretty😍❤️💕😘
She's gorg
Goddess 😍

Sen her halinle güzelsin Rihanna abla
Fondöten çok sarı değil mi bebeğim ya?
I just felt so happy when she said "makeup is fun"
Her personality is my favourite. She doesnt do a valley girl voice, she’s funny, a little quirk and her presence is so bright i can listen to her talk about anything!
Summer Sunset  Love Drama BITCHESSSSZZZZZ

She is beautiful than I thought
i love youuuuu RI Ri
Beauty gurus is QUACKING
Why did I think I was gonna hear that accent
OH MY GOD HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS  I AWFULLY LOVE YOU MY QUEEN
What is this body shimmer?!
i think her foundation is not match her skin colour
When I first saw this I thought she could crush it as a youtuber then I stopped and think Is it really something she wouldn't crush?
0:40 orange is the new black
She makes fun of  yourself. I love people like that . Lol
"voila" XD
My longtime sister RiRi is slayingggg the gram😍😍😍 I really wish I could meet her IRL😭
Love her
OOOOOOOOOOO THAT HIGHLIGHTER IS AMAZING
日本人どこーーーー！！！！
She's a natural guru
i hate when someone doesn't apply foundation on their neck....
Oml I love her XD
Riri still looks stunning even without makeup.
I love her music but i become a fan pf her too like she’s so cute
Her skin has more beaty without it
So imagino com a voz do diogo parodias kkkk
Asmr af
Yes rhianna is an amazing artist but she is probably one of the most sweet nice and heart worming influencer and celeberity i no of like if u igree
Okay honestly this looked so horrible when she started and then somehow it began to look like she was a goddess. So glad I kept watching lol
O que eu quero?? .. Eu quero. Pão 😂😂😂
i can watch this everyday and it’s interesting every time and i always fall in love with her more and more
4:40
😍😍😍😍
my name is rihanna
QUEEN👑
Rihanna is pretty either way
Love it!!! ❤️❤️😊
Her voice is just too... sweet ..love her
7:51 why is this sound so satisfying to me haha
Her forehead up to god
Ok... someone get RiRi her own makeup YouTube channel NOW!!!
shes so freaking gorgeous, she has such clear skin and perfect eyebrows 😩
Which lipgloss did she use?
THE BLEND IS REALLL!😂  I just love rihanna
Legit goddess
Situation 😂😂
She is orange
An icon.
https://youtu.be/VA4NiEQUm5o
never thought i would ever watch a full makeup video but here i am! things we do for rihanna ❤️
Ah, the only thing (most) women are actually good at.
So pretty my queen
Rihanna is so adorable she is the nicest skin she has the  nicest hair look she is so beautiful she doesn’t even need make up
The makeup wasnt her shade:(
I could watch this a hundred times
SLAY
Rihanna did a great job in OCEANS 8...made me think to revise a roll on a script I already finished and change the character to her, because it has two bits of a cappella rap and its a tough girl role amongst a bunch of men.  I think she could pull it off.
Omg rihanna’s So effin cuteeee LOL
Yo she is just too cute 😁😍😘
Cute
I love RiRi but her foundation is not her coulor😉
She is just too adorable 😍
Rihanna is EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!
"Sabe o que eu quero?  Eu quero PÃO!"
Rihanna you are so original that even makeup can't change your look or hide away your preety face. So, I think you don't need makeup😊 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
She’s the cutest doll in the world 😘😘😘😘 Love you girl
اضن انا الوحيده الي اخس شخصيتها زي ريناد😂😂🌚
Bags. dark circles. Hangovers. Bad decisions 😄
I don’t get why EVERYONE is flipping out over her foundation shade. Literally 3 minutes into the video she says that she has a sun burn. Makeup brands don’t make foundation to match sunburns and she may not have been able to go and get a shade closer to the colour she was in the video. Besides it sinks in at the end and looks FLAWLESS!!!!
YOU ARE ALSO SO BEAUTIFUL!!!
Rihanna I love your makeup so much and I really how you are so into it so keep up with it😆😆
the cutest
wow sis nice lashes sis i like it very much FULL VIEW
She has a big forehead no offense
Wohwohwohwohwohwoh so at the start of the video - she didn't have no makeup on - whattttttt??????????
What was the shimmer product on her shoulder ?!😩
Rihanna really is pretty and I really like her so much and my sister and me are big fans of Rihanna my name is Lily Mae
リアーナ👗😘💞💗

I love you Rihanna.. 💘 Whit mack up and Whit out mack up u always Looking so beautiful and gorgeous.  .. 💞❤💛💛💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💙💙💙💙😘😘😘

- Rihanna, qual o segredo do seu brilho? - Querida, primeiramente, talento depois um pouquinho de fenty beauty na medida certa pra chegar a isso   "Seja linda, se for possível" #DiogoParodias
she uses a mini beauty blender for her concealer!!
Wrong shade huni
Isso só me lembra o Diogo paródias
Who did she shush? I hope it was like her dog or something bc if it was a person that was rude still love u
5:33😂😂😂

Her smile warms my heart
That pink eyeshadow looks sooo pretty on her
I literally just watch 10 minutes of epicness

Cutie
The way she saids “Contour” 😍😍😍💕💕 you’re perfect Riri
Im in loveee
Omg her skin looks bleached. Like it's not a natural color at all. Ew
she pretty
This was a life-giving video.
omg shes so adorable
De todas maneras ahora ya hay muchas mujeres guapas como ella yo las e visto, rihanna no es la unica
Pues de cara es normalita tampoco no es para tanto, hay mas guapa k ella de cara, tiene una cara de orangutan y no es tan bonita
She's such a smoke show. And she's adorable. Stop girl, stop! 😍😍😍
Rihanna play to much in the beginning she said I look fat the when she doing her eyeshadow she like drama blah blah bitchessss    Edit:but she’s so adorable ughhh and I love how she she during her own Fenty products I literally have all of those
every products who are not her’s, she’s not showing them like brows or mascara...
Barbie doll,😘
I love Rihanna and all her songs
I don't like her music anymore, I used to like it. But she is incredible, an extraordinary person ( not that I know her personally but because the charity, she's a true philanthropist and a savage big time boss), she can turn random shits in masterpiece. I really respect her! You're a queen Rhiri.
I love my wife.
She is soooooo adorable and beautiful😍😍😚😚❤❤ I love her❤❤😚😚😍😍
2:22 “a me piace avere un pene sotto al mento, che bello, capito ti slancia come un cigno”
Her foundation looks like a yellow undertone but her skin is a pink undertone., okay
Why is Rihanna famous
this was better than an ASMR video 😍😍😍😍😍
Very special nose 😂😂😂 haha I love her
Nilay Toprak'ın dublaj videosu aklıma geliyor. Ciddiye alamıyorum 😂
She does not need make up
If I warmed up my concealer like that I had to buy one every week
pretty 😍😍
The foundation is too yellow plus shes being real silly here.  But I love the highlighting and colorful eyeshadows she uses. :)
Look at u honey u r soo beautiful love Rihanna 😘😍
I don't even wear makeup but i'm watching this for the fifth time. That's the power of Rihanna.
i love her
Her eyes are such a beautiful color 😍😍
OMG I love this chic! LOL FUNNY AF!!!!! So real.....
Ahh I wish Rihanna tries asmr!!!!
She loves to be like the sun yanno  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
QUEEEEEEEEN
I know I’m late, but I am SO thankful for Rihanna! She taught me to really enjoy makeup and to have fun with it. With all these other beauty gurus, I was always scared that I was doing my makeup wrong which made me fear doing it more. Although their makeup is beautiful as well, I just love Rihanna and how approachable she made makeup and how there’s something for everyone. Love u Ri-Ri and shine on!! <3
*james charles has left the chat*
I’m so in love with her
Ahhh I’ve watched this so many timesss 😂😂 Riri is a goddess 😍❤️🔥
by the way, I hate her foundation it is too yellow for her skin...
She's so sweet😍
Quando eu olho para esse vídeo,  só lembro da dublagem daquele cara,  kkkk esse vídeo sem a dublagem não tem graça

She’s beautiful, and so is her personality. ♥️♥️♥️
Rihanna is pretty but she has too much makeup
Lol 😂
Did anyone notice how smooth her skin is? 😍😍 Not a pore or bump in sight as she was applying her foundation.
Casper Rihanna
At first I was scared cuz her foundation was so yellow and she didn’t bring it down to her neck so it looked all weird but then it set more and it kind of matched her actual color a little more and so I felt a little satisfied with that lol I was constantly comparing the two tones throughout the video and then when I saw they both matched up I was like “what in the sorcery??!” 😂😂😂
Riri why are you even wearing makeup?? You beautiful ♥️
Your so pretty😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She doesn't even need she's very pretty on her own

Riri 😍
Natural face. :) No plastic surgery.
She is gorgeous
I love  her voice omg
summer, sunset, love, drama, BITCHES
Is this for real? That foundation shade is wrong for her, it doesn't match her neck or chest. However, she always kills the nose contour/highlight and that body stuff was super cool!
I feel like rihanna would look so hot without hair because of her nice forehead...
I See you all Vip just on Sage or in Video.Ok youtube the let us know how rich you are andwhat matrial houses,cars,fashion..this is it. Fan and Star i want to know if you have the Same Charakter
Your face and her.Nathashia you don't know her she ain't famous,she have also a simular face blackskinn girl.I know her Charakter but yours and meghans mother i don't know.
Rihanna i think Meghans Mother is you unknowing twin sister.
Her personality is just amazing
Te amo❤

i like kylie's better...riri just looks like a clown with that weird lipgloss and blinding highlight
Love Rihanna so much
But her face doesn’t have the same color than her body ! I think she should take a foundation for her skin
She‘s pretty w and without makeup I love her ❣️
The most genuine and realistic tutorial out there...not to mention it's by an absolute queen ❤️
Beautiful
imagine creating one of the  extensive makeup lines, shade-wise, yet not being able to find a concealer that actually fits your skin tone lmao and don’t @ me with the “concealer is supposed to be lighter!1!!!” y’all know that it’s wayy too light
What is the track playing in the background?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzFsej9Sz2Q
i am a fan !!!
Queen you look beautiful natural

0:06 "no I look fat" where riri?
Feels like asmr
I love how she uses all her own products but not in a really obvious promotional way like she didn’t ask you to buy the product ONCE
that foundation is orange , her skin tone is so much better fresh faced . why is she allowed to use that tone ?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Makeup orange and black skin. lacked following the original skin tone.
That foundation seems alil light for her. 😕
Amazing
more is more
Queeennnn ❤️❤️❤️
Sometimes i forget she's super normal like the rest of us.
Too bad  you don't show eyebrows:((
“Woomf “ as a lot of people like to call it 😂😂
This is 100000000000 times better than the plastic chick’s one
Her face is different color than her neck
I feel like the foundation is too yellow
l kinda have lips like her
She's very honest and relatable kind of person and i love her
At first the foundation looks orange but then the orange fades away and i like it
Omfg she is so pretty!!!!
No one is gonna mention her foundation doesn't match her at all?? And that her makeup application is sloppy?
What lip gloss did she use?
As bicha piiira, nas minhas makes, é podem comprar !
she is gorgeous <3
What is the foundation shade she is using here
Love this!!

Why can't men wear this kind of makeup? And don't say "they can" because obviously we can't. Seriously.. it's the last frontier of gender equality when we are ALL either using makeup, or not using makeup.
Summer.... Sunset... Love.. Drama    BITCHES
MARAVILHOSA 😍😍😍
What?...Riri, i am a big fan of you, but i cannot get over on the fact that you put more concealer on the back of your hand than on ur face😂 Luv her❤️❤️😘

😍😍😍😍😍😍
Does she wearing eyes contact lens? Wht the brand?

Queen 😍
Beautiful w/ or w/o make up 😩❤
stunning personality!
what a beauty! Even you don't need any makeup. Love u <3
But why she put on foundation a lighter color than her face . That was weird
I duped these products hard. You would be surprised what u can do with your collection
I wanna marry her
SHE'S PERFECT TF
I like that she used her products because some makeup industries doesn’t wear their own products💕
2:33 im sweatin
Her smile is actually gorgeous
"see that? ahh!"
ik that the foundations oxidizes and the shade gets a bit darker but hey that shade is so not hers even at the end of the video
The way she says contour sounds so sophisticated

Riri is Queen, but why is everyone comparing Kylie and Riri? They are their own person so why they have to be compared? I get some of the “beef” and the whole makeup lines but why can’t they just be individual brands? Like ppl who love Kylie awesome, ppl who love Rihanna awesome. PPL WHO LOVE BOTH AWESOME!

I love watching Rihanna enjoying getting made up.  I was all smiles until I heard FAT.  I'm fat.  Why is that such a terrible thing?  Please be considerate about the young ladies paying close attention to you and the words you use.  They're looking up to you.
Rihanna!! You Are Hilarious! 😂😂❤️
5:32 it’s my favorite time.
OMG ILY !! U ARE SO AMAZING AND YOUR SINGING IS AMAZING. I WISH U WERE MY BEST FRIEND. 😩👑YOU ARE MY FAVORITE CAUSE YOUR NOT FAKE LIKE OTHER CELEBRITIES. Ily!

Step 1: Be Rihanna  Step 2: Be Mega Attractive  Step 3: Why even try??
Oh my god 😰
she has so different Personality and first time i am Listening her Voice ,she is good
Does anybody know which one of her lipglosses she used?  😫😍🔥🔥
This is by far the best makeup tutorial in vogue. I love u Rihanna
I love her!!!
Rihanna is beautiful. Without the makeup
Shes so flawless that i thought she was wearing makeup before she even started the tutorial 😂
Her foundation is so orange🍊
I know most of the products were hers, but what about the bronzer, the shadow she used for the inner corner of her eye, or the shadow under her eyelids? I need to know 😫✨✨💖😍
I love how makeup sits on black skin. It almost accentuates rather than conceals. I'd love a darker skin tone.
I love her fun, funny personality!❤️😍😂
i loooooovee her
This is my favorite makeup tutorial!!!
I love youuuu so much💕💕💕❤
"Eu vou ser uma baiana eu sou uma baiana!"
You are naturally gorgeous
A pessoa é tao linda que pensei que já estava maquiada no início do vídeo❤
James charles thx
call me pls
she looks like a clown
I was smiling the whole video :)
Is it me or does her face look extremely golden compared to her neck? Love this tutorial though, I really wanna try out the foundation and the new eyeshadow palette that she's releasing this month.
So gorgeous
I can’t be that goddess but I gotta accept my beauty
Queen

We love a glowing KWEEN
Si la amo❤
Ugh how can you not love her?!
She is amazing but I think that her foundation is more clear than her skin color, I don't know but she looks beautiful
She has this aura of natural beauty and it is so warming. Her personality is a bonus
Lick a shot for the gangsta niggas n predicate felons that know that doin they time is better than tellin...DONT TELL DOG! - Styles P

She makes it look so easy 🙄🙄😂

WHAT IS THAT LIP GLOSS AND PINK EYE SHADOW? I NEED THAT IN MY LIFE
I loved this! The awkwardness turned funny, the dramatizing of it all 🤣🤣🤣🤣 RiRi you are too real ❤️❤️❤️
"Eu vou ser uma baiana, eu sou uma baiana" kkkkkkkkkk Diogo parodias kkkkkk

she's amafuckingmazing
The power of makeup. Why is she using light makeup before tutorial? So ashamed to show her bareface. Ugh
She seems like a cool person to be friends with
For everyone coming at Kylie, at least her foundation matched her body.
I love her so much
She 's soooooo fun, I love her personality !
Rihanna is definitely bae I just love her energy and she did her thing
The sound she made when she put on her lip gloss was priceless
She is just... perfect.
Natural beauty! Love you Riri!! This was the best makeup tutorial I have ever seen
I'm a dude, wtf am I doing here?
9:14 oh her face😭😭
Shes pretty with or without make-up, who's with me?? 😊😊😊
does she know that the foundation isn't her shade?
Wooooow beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥
Love her pink girly makeup! 💖✨💋
Anyone knows what she used for her inner eyes? That glitter thing? X
Your forehead is too broad nowadays you shaved ur head in half or what
i think these are the single 10 minutes of her life that she's not high hahahah :D
Может такое освещение,но тональный крем ей вообще не подходи по тону. Он какой-то жёлтый,по сравнению с её цветом шеи,и всего тела
fore head game too strong
Loveeeee her😍😍😍😍🙌🏼✨
Why do you need a guide on how to not wear makeup? Just accept your natural appearance and don’t wear it
her smile is so cute
😍 perfect!
“more is more” -rihanna
Her skin like girl yasss she’s so beautiful
Everyone is talking abt her foundation but the fenty foundation does oxidize and gets darker
I watched this at least 10 times now😂

“I’m gonna start with a link on the lid because it says summer, sunsets, love, drama, *bITCHES* ” I LOVE RIHANNA
Queen

I really wish that I could be friends with her. She sounds like a great person. Her personality matches her looks
Yesssss QUEEN ✨♥️♥️♥️
She should be a YouTuber  because she is so funny
Queen was GLOWINGGGGG
I had to watch this like 50 times..so satisfying
I juz love her
her foundation and contour is way too light in my opinion...she also goes around the dark parts under her eyes???
rihanna you are beautiful.. And your so down to earth 😍😍🤗
I JUST LOVED THIS VIDEO. FIRST TIME I ENJOY A TUTORIAL. RIHANNA IS JUSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTT GLORIOUSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Her face was a whole shade lighter than the rest of her...
I LIKED OCEANS 8!!
❤❤❤❤❤
Fui la única que pensó que fue un desastre!!! 😂😂😂
My vibe for summer is MORE IS MORE 😂💓
"I look kind of cute:, you look alot of cute
She is so beautiful and adorable MashAllah
You're so pretty ,I Love you're Hair
omg this is by far my favorite vogue makeup tutorial!!! Hire heeeeerrrrrr
perroooo likeee..... where part 2
she has such a relaxing voice and she needs to do asmr like now
I know she did not just say she look fat omg 😭
she is so prettttyyyyyyyyyyy
She’s so beautiful 😍
Everything looks amazing on her. ❤
riri i love you so so much 😍😍😍
She’s gorgeous
Please don’t refer to triangles Rihanna all I can think of is the illuminati 😭

i love how she says contour😂😂it sounds so elegant
She is absolutely beautiful with and without makeup!❣️
I love how she says contour
Rihanna is so pretty 😍😍
omg at first when she put the foundation i was scared for the shade. but it oxidized beautifully
lol she didn’t show us her doing her brows. sis said “no free brand deals”💀
I want all her makeup products now !!!
She is so adorable omg where was I all this long?
Wow! Rihanna u definitely vogue
After watching Kylie's makeup routine,I can now see how much she (kj) lacks personality wowww.
She is so cute I love  her personality
You are so lovely😂
Rihanna in love with this video❤❤❤
Тон лица вообще не подходит! Разве это не замечает?
she's so wholesome i love her
Am I the only who thinks she looks better without makeup
ICONIC✨✨
She has “fat days”, I have been on a ... like ... fat decade, tbh.
She. Is. So. Beautiful. She. Doesn’t. Need. Makeup. 😻😻😻😻
Her voice ate me😭😭🙌🏻🤤
A 9:04 Rihana parle français
she so pretty 🤤
My crush
I am sorry, but her foundation shade seems too orange and she didn't even blend it to her neck. I am aware of the fact darker skinned women need to use warmer shades of foundation instead of cool ones, but this is too much.
3:04 😍😍😍😍
Rihanna
Wow, loved herself much. And that foundation didn't match her skin at all.
Beautiful, awesome n stunning!!😘😘😘
RiRi keeps it real 100%, legit reminds me of my sister

“Get it...*looks down* yeah”

Love rihanna
She's beautiful. And her personality is... I can explained. I just love her.
Rihanna you should make a YouTube channel
Omg I love her
Rihanna does a lot of monochrome looks, which is the best for her face and personality
I just  wanna take her everywhere I go 😭😭😍 I’m wanna put her in my pocket
"More is more" That's right, girl!
I love how Rihanna is so funny and she is beautiful without makeup...you go girl!!
omg i love her 😭😍💘
LOL who came on here after watching Kylie’s tutorial? I’ve decided after watching Rihanna’s again hers is definitely better,she shows more personality and is way more fun to watch. Where as Kylie’s tutorial was so dry and boring .
Does anybody notice how beautiful and long her lashes are😍😍
Look at her😍 she is so beautiful, your nose is beautiful darling😍😍😍 if you see this, my friends and I are talking about you sometimes, and we are like "I dont think you understand how beautiful she is?" I dont think I will ever understand,
is the body lava a thing in the website? I can't find it!
Watching this for the trillionth time and now cathing this@ 5:23 😂😂 "because I'm black you know, that's a very special nose".....uuum!!relatable
she has no eyebrows

I could fall asleep to her voice
Came back to this after Kylie had to do one lmaooo
without doing plastic surgery
8:43 rihanna is very funny😂😂😂
Petition for Rihanna to start a beauty channel????
These videos would be so much better without music
She is absolutely gorgeous! Natural beauty!!
Very slow. Talk faster
Just found out today Rihanna is her middle name and her first name is Robyn. Also found out her last name is Fenty, so that’s new....
She is so charismatic, cute and beautiful! Such a queen😍💕
12,8M ❤
What double chin tho😩
كتير حلو
I came here again after watching Kylie's video. Anyone else?🤔😂
I’m falling in love
Oh yah
does anyone know the name of the lipstick she uses, its gorgeous!
I think that was wig😊😊
She is damm hot......I mean good
lol i love Riri 😘😘😘😘😘
Hey girls, my girlfriend made me watch make up tutorials on YouTube. Tbh I don't really know what to do about it, i just watch the vid and i hope I remember the steps. It would be really cool if any of you girls can give me advice on what to focus on. I'm still new to this 😐
I love you Rihanna so much ❤😭
" Voilà... " 😂❤
rihanna tiene unos ojos muy bonitos!
her face is yellow now...
Her skin was prettier without the foundation tho. She doesn't need a full face of foundation and it was a little bit too light and orange for my taste and doesn't fit with her neck. She looks prettier when she keeps it more natural tbh.
Her face at 9:15 😂😂😂 I FEEL FAM I FEEL  🤣
I never expected her to be this funny! 😂The best of surprises. I came for the makeup and stayed for her personality! Haha 😁
Love u rih
love it https://cursmakeup.ro
So cute cutie
She's so real to me after watching this. Get yo money boo! 👸🏾👑
She looks so pretty without it
I use her products
Her skin is so flawless😍
Love.  E engano meu ou a base ficou muito amarelada. Bem que pode ser a iluminação ne.
I loved this, Rihanna is so funny :))

So beauty😍
She is originally beautiful...
Rihanna’s laugh ♥️

I love her so much lol 😍😍. She has a cute personality
When it started I thought she already had the make up on.  She was so beautiful with almost no make up that the make up is just to have fun. Riri is such a unique creature. So beautiful, talented, and with a very unique personality. You could travel the world multiple times and never find anyone like her.

Does anyone know the name of the product and or brand of the body shimmer she uses???
Beautiful i like your make up Rihanna
Her foundation looks lighter because she's a star and there's gonna be lights everywhere around her so she has to have lighter foundation. Ya know?

Came back for a forth time because this video is everything!! I'm officially the new owner to some fenty products for the first time! I'm so freaking blown away by the quality of these highlighters I used the tiniest amount and got a blinding highlight and I know a lot of people are gonna be pissed I'm saying this but I think Fenty highlighters are even better then Anastasia Beverly Hills highlighters!!
I could listen to her talk all day
she is so fun! this was everything!
Len Türkler nerede genelde böyle saçma şeylere biz geliriz de onun için dedim😂😂😂😂
She seems very nice and down to earth.

Never though I could enjoy watching a makeup tutorial, bigups Riri, besides, who knew there was a "brow bone"?
Only Rihanna can do her makeup in 10 minuets and still look like a Beautiful angel

*ginormous Hands!*

Does Sailor J ever remind you of how funny and talkative Rihanna is?

Why I always have to be the bad guy? The make up did not match. Her face was one tone and her shoulders and neck was another. Is this how make up is done because really I don 't wear it so IDK.

Fenty beauty needs to release a lipstick called "Riri's lips" cause  Rihanna's natural lip color is freaking perfect.

Does anyone now all the Fenty products she used in the video? I've been trying to find a list but can't seem to find a comprehensive list
You and Chris Brown looked good together IN MY OPINION HE IS BETTER
Gurrllll, what double chin?! Lookin beautiful clear face and done up! ❤
That foundation does not match her skin & no product list for this vid. Expected more.
when she cute even before doing her makeup
it’s impossible to not be in love with her
You're soo darn beautiful RiRi
I wish fenty beauty come Turkey why didnt come ı dont understand 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂

I LOVE YOU
8:43 LOL she's funny
But l liked your natural skin color with a light red blush at your cheeks
adorable
Rihanna is so Pretty i cryyyyy
No I look fat haha I love her voice
These are the videos that make people realize that celebs are normal humans too and I LOVE those type of videos.
She is just so fresh and she just know how to do her thing, a godess, in resume
Huge forehead here😂✋✋
She’s perfect, funny, down to earth... I love her!
My QUEEN, YASS!!😍
Rihanna is such a dork lol
I"m not sure why she applied dark under her eyes, she looked prettier without that. But so hilarious and so smart n confident!
absolutely lovee herrrr 😩
Who are these people that can do their make up with hair open. I need to tie that up in a bun & use headband even for everyday makeup
wow i love her.
Her eyes are so beautiful. She is beautiful!
i’m gonna wear this to my graduation
She has perfect skin to begin with.
Ummmm ICON
I wants me Fenty Beauty products and I wants it now.
A lot of people in the past say that she bleached her skin. And I believed it at first. But it's just makeup. The power of makeup can change your skin tone. Foundations can too. You'll notice her skin tone was a little different before she applied her makeup.
Anyone else notice her accent has faded?
You go girl is see you I see you !😙😊
Rihanna > beyonce
73 questions please
i love watching her have fun
😂😂😂😂❤
I saw this on Instagram and I absolutely LOVE Rihanna's personality in this video
décor in the back is so bad....why?!?
She’s naturally beautiful
love her girl
Looove the "voilà"😍😍
why isn´t ANYONE noticing all the fatshaming she does???? it´s shocking to me how everyone just let that slip because she is considered famous or whatever. As an "influencer" it hurts SO many young people out there when she normalizes fat hating. i actually thought higher of rihanna, WHY complain over ur appearance in such terms??? and not to mention when she said "because I'm black i have a special nose", literally; ew
makeup on fleek. i love her so much bc she is herself and so beautiful and funny. her personality is the best. it reminds me of myself. so relatable
sabia que era el hotel palmilla :3 ❤❤❤❤
Rihanna
Rihhana has such a cute personality .
WHY WHY WHY does she need a make up? Gorgeous fresh beautiful young face! (And extremely talented and nice person). I adore her!!!
And bad decisions 😂😂😂😂😂 riri is so honest and relatable
5:33 as bicha pira pira nas minha makes hauahauahauauaa.
Love it RiRi.  It really take a lot to make a natural polished look. Thanks
Ugh she’s so pretty her skin is glowing I’m a spotty mess
my gosh I love her personality
SHE'S SO ADORABLE I ALMOST FORGOT THAT SHE IS A HUMAN TOO 😂😂😂
I EFFING LOVE HER 💖💕
i seriously thought her make up was done when the video started 😩😂
she's just so so beauiful ahhh i love herrrr
...FISICO
FISICO
Aaaaahhhh☺
Not love the beauty.  Love her.

Yesss girl your goals👏🏽 I absolutely LOVE your highlighter
OMG I LOVE RIHANNA SOOOO MUCH 😍😍😍😍💟💞💝🖤💜💛💚💙💗💖💕💓❤💘 I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT IN WORDS
It's not her color of foundation
I've never been a huge fan of her music, just love the hits, but I've always respected her as an artist and as a person, she is soooo amazing, I love her so much.
i want that
that was funny
Beautiful with or without make-up
"Hoje eu vou ensinar você a ter esse balanço" kkkkkkkkkk
se me afigura, o veo sus manos como muy grotescas? creo ke los tatuajes y las uñas de garra las hacen ver muy toscas
we stan
she is such an icon
i thought she was wearing makeup in the beginning omg
All I want out of my life is to be Rihanna's friend 😭😭😂😂
This is the cutest thing I've seen all day
I’m in love with her
Managed to see QUEEN RIRI today at the Ocean's 8 European premiere!!  She's just as gorgeous in real life as she looks on screen!!
"No I look fat".... Meeeeee
Minha  diva ❤
Thx for showing girls how to trick guys into thinking there painted on face is good looking.
Look at this oppressed black women. Struggling through life...
Id die for her no doubt
Our girl riri, The beginning 😂😂 Shes not fat or ugly, shes a queen who has a beautiful face and a beautiful personality. 😊
I love her 🌺 she so crazy!!!
I love you forever and ever xoxoxoxoxo
Rihanna is awesome for creating such a wide variety of makeup for different skin tones... And I'm only adding that so people here won't call me a hater but she seems drunk or high in this video. Is it just me? Or is she always like this?
horrible and stupid
She needs too make herself a YouTube channel
omg. I'm buying FENTY Beauty products RN.
I really wanna be her friend:(
I love her.
I need concealer in my life😐
I like her! She is funny and this makeup is perfect also she does a really good makeup.

HI sh hi
Her foundation looks orange af
One word:    GORGEOUS❤❤❤❤
I could watch her all day. Like I would actually sit and watch all of her makeup tut videos ALL.DAY.
I jus love how cool and chill back she is😂
Would never get bored to watch it again and again. The way she put the highlight on her body just simply relaxing and I wish I have that much confidence in me. Love this vid..😘
Needed this 🦄
She needs her own TV show
Thank you riri🤘🇲🇺
Oh my god, Rihanna is the best thing to ever happen in this world. Her obsession with highlighter, her unignorable cuteness, her ability to rock everything she wears... Riri truly is a queen.
You’re skin glows so naturally! You’re gorgeous with and without make up!
such white eyes :)
OMG I love Riri...her voice, personality...OMG I can't. My best celeb of all time...ever ever
This video is my favorite thing in the internet

One of the most beautiful faces in the world. Her beauty shines like a diamond <3

💓💓💓💖💖💖
Her accent 😍
I thought she was already wearing makeup at the beginning. Then she put on foundation. Must be nice to have your natural face so pretty, and clear!! I liked her skin better before the foundation. It looked a little light for her. Loved the rest of the makeup look and that body makeup, too.
Hit that neck momma!  Always blend into ur neck woman! 🤣😘
I sure did enjoy this. She is funny and sweet.
She's sooooo cuuuuuuteeee
8:17 😂😂

BEAUTIFUL BABE 😍
Courage rihanna

That was NOT 10 minutes!!!!
She looks better without make up she has natural beauty

Impossível não assistir e lembrar da voz do Diogo 😂 Riri,  I love you ♥️
I love her voice
What’s the name of this bronzer ?
Rihanna is such an *ICONIC QUEEEEEEEN* 😍 😂
I want Fenty Beauty Brow products 🙏🏽💕
Is she high? Lolz I love her❤️❤️
So pretty
Só eu que sou brasileira  kkkkkk
Quem ai veio por causa daquela dublagem esquisiata da like
Shes so cute😍 😩😍
My spirit animal🧡
Rihanna ✨❤️
I prefer as it is, than make up
She's so gorgeous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHLM1C--DvM
I have a big forehead just like her, and she makes me feel so confident about it. Love ya Rih
Omg she needs no make up at all! When the video first started I thought she already makeup on😂 She is naturally beautiful😍
hello,bom dia e sempre linda asi ou não é bonita sempre foi,é atraente,boa mulher bela beleza negra toda perfeita natureza boa.muita paz,.....yes,kiss.
Sempre linda
hei
I HAVE YOUR MAKEUP 💄 ✨
Rhianna has a very much a comedy side ....talk beautiful....with or without the makeup. Natural beauty
its like painting on the face
I'm still a beginner in makeup and I even ask a Makeup artist to help me but it didn't look great but as Rihanna said the best Teacher is yourself and that I should try on my on face, I kinda feel better now since makeup is quite hard for me to do. And I also like how much she has fun doing that Video 💕
Is tat her real hair?
SHES SO ADORABLE OMG
you are pretty <3
‘8.17’ hahahahahahahha😂
Why is she using grey contour?
Cuz it is summ3r love drama bitches 😂
She's so pretty, but that foundation was way too cool a tone for her gorgeous copper skin.
Anybody wants to be small youtube friends? 😊💕
If you look real close you can still see Chris Brown's left hand.
I love my queen
you are so cute. you should have a youtube channel  haha. id there anyone who like wear color content lens? there is a big promotion in imool.com. 2pair color contents only 6$ still available until 18th June.
The foundation was at least 3 shades lighter???
This made me relate to her on so many levels. I loved it. Lol it inspired me as well...if she can do her make up with FENTY products so effortlessly...I can too! It seemed so genuine like there was no trickery in making the products look better to sell it was just real.
*gets a compliment*
I WANNA TRY SOME OF *^THIS^*
Her reaction when she put the lipgloss on !! Me when I discovered nymphette by MAC
i have watched this video so many times 😍😍😍
First, Rihanna, I have to say that you are vastly more gorgeous without makeup. But, I get that it's fun to play with your looks. I just found that the tone of your foundation was too yellow for your skin. You're certainly skilled at applying it, though. And, it was fun to watch your video!
"love, drama... BITCHES"
#diogoparodia #Brasil
Boom gorgeous Rihanna ❤️❤️❤️❤️
More Riri MOOOOORE!
I love her, she's so cute!!!! 😍😍😍😍

Siri: Hide that double chin Me: WheRe RiRI?! WHErE???!!

You are  funny
James Charles WHO  Jeffry star Who
Even though her foundation did not match her body and I really did not like the tutorial overall. I cannot stop watching it she is so stunning. Like other worldly stunning. Also her raspy accented voice is very soothing. She is very mesmerizing and mysterious. She just sucks you in. You cannot stop watching her even when she's doing a garbage makeup tutorial.
OMFG . She's PERFECT
A queen
มาจากพาร์คพากย์นรก 🙌🏻🙌🏻
I love you Riri, thanks for being inspired
It's a fun tutorial, she's so talented! But I can't get over how wrong that shade of foundation is for her, the difference to her neck and chest is so visible, like she wears a mask...

She really doesn't need makeup! pretty Jus the way she is
Idk why m i even watching this for. M Not even a girl xD.
anyone know what the highlight stick is called that she put in the inner corner of her eye?
Actually love you sm girllll😂😭💗💗💗💗
Love you, Riri.
ASMR
wow, very nice, watch more https://youtu.be/qC2-wXkeNIM
Don’t know why people were criticizing her foundation. Everyone knows Fenty Foundation oxidizes and in the end, it matches her perfectly. It takes about 5-10 minutes to darken.
She is so good. She has talent. Love her and her music! 💫 & my music in my profile✋🏻
What was that lip gloss she used?
She’s literally the cutest !  I love her ! ❤️
U look nice
Listen this song is for you :) you would facken love it https://youtu.be/xPMp7n1dPuw
I like the fact that she mentioned her forehead, double chin, and nose.  It makes her more relatable and normal....just like the rest of us.  Embrace your flawless and rock it anyway.
Yassssssss Girl! She is so funny she needs to have her own channel, like this if you love my girl Ri Ri
7:51 "bom!" muito bom mesmo rih, te amo bjs
She’s everything😫😫😫😍😍💕💓her highlight is so mesmerizing😍😍😍
looking in the mirror after watching this video was a baaaad idea

Harika bir şeysin sen ya 😍😍😍😍😍

Riri is just so chill here and her voice is legi† µusic to my ears
9:12 "tá entupido essa porra" 🤣🤣🤣🤣

She does not need make up
リアーナ別格すぎる美人よね、、💕 ほんとフェイスラインから目の色から綺麗😍😘😘
めっちゃ美人！ほんと綺麗😊💕✨
Lol. I love it...you did it so effortlessly 😊
"I learnt how to contour ... when i got fat" lmao SAME
is this the most watched Vogue vid?
I love the way she pronounced contour
💖💖💖💖💖💣💝🎁🎀🎊🎉
At first I was like that’s not your color riri
She said "summer,sunset,love,drama,BITCHES" I'm deceased
I drew u and hung it up
She gone be my wife 😍
Also your not fat
Why need makeup when u already pretty riri
Her eyes has always facinated me.
summer sunset love drama.... BITCHES 😂😂😂
dang she's beautiful
The best
“Bad decisions”
Que frentoooon
She’s so down to earth and humble, yet she’s so amazing!❤️
Eu amo essa mulher 😱
plis color the neck
wish I could waste that much concealer to "warm up" the product😂
There is something so innocent about her.
Oh my lord she's so gorgeous <3
maybe i’m in love with her
makeup or not your beautiful. love your nails
Her attitude is awesome, she’s very humble 💕
Am I the only one who thinks her Face looked better before makeup ? Though the body thing was good...Maybe something like that for face could have worked...
Oiii Brasil
she's so gorgeous
Loved this! I didn't know Rihanna was this fun too...  Great one Riri!
this was the most amusing tutorial i've ever seen in my life
Lol she’s goofy
"Oddio so' grassa"    Cit. 😂
Lovely 💕
That pink eyeshadow as a blush is so stunning, but you have to be really careful with putting a shimmer blush on if you have any texture to your skin. Rihanna was blessed with beautiful skin so she can put anything anywhere on her face and rock it.
“We goin to the clurb” lmao clurb
Is it just me or is this actually not her foundation shade? It seems too yellow
She is so cute! Godddd
I wanna see more of this side of her!!
Oh, RiRi . Pretty queen U R , luv you're tutorial and songs. U should have a channel of you're own because how funny U R . < 3

Don't like the fondation on your face
she did her makeup so effortlessly and yet she looks bomb.  i cant even apply mascara without smudging it all over my face :')
Epaaa sem esse bit kkkkk tira o bit da história kkk
The product sells itself she barely had to say anything.  On a side note, didn't know Rihanna was funny! Love this
Türkler burda mı😂
The foundation to me looks so yellow she has a pinky warm tone to her skin.
i'm in love.

BIR TANRIÇA ANLATMAYA GEREK YOK GÖRÜYORSUNUZ
She’s so beautiful wtf
😍😍😍
Rihana is queen but her foundation didn’t match her skin 😭
Pisces imaginative and artistic nature makes them the most inspiring sign of all ! True for Riri !😊
QUEEEEEEEEEN
Rihanna... 💗 8:42 Hahahahaha............
“SHHH”
I just love that she is being herself
Riri you made my life with this video 😍 I did my first face beat video, please check it out 😊 https://youtu.be/CTijwdyRweg
Que Preciosa es Rihanna Hermosa, y no me gustan las mujeres pero Dios esto no fue parejoo, no es justooo. 😐😖😦☹
Omg she's sooo cute I love her
But cool makeup
I hate the way she talks she seems like she's really rude and mean
Un.poco.frentona pero guapa!😋
When she walked on I deadass truly thoughts she was already in full glam
I don't wear makeup and I don't listen to Rihanna but she seriously needs a YouTube channel, this was entertaining.
Rihanna has a great voice
I LOVE YOU ♥
what?she didn't have make up before???!
what?she didn't have make up before???!
Yes baby.I enjoyed it thoroughly. 🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧
her face is yellow
She has the best personality of any makeup artist. Is the body lava and brush her brand?
Jaajjaja Que graciosa! ❤
She's lost almost all of her Barbados accent.  Considering how long she has lived in the US now,  I guess that's only natural, but I still think it's a little bit sad...
This video was oddly therapeutic, I don’t even wear make up but I feel so relaxed.
"Eu sou uma baiana"
You are a beautiful person not because of your physical beauty or your music. You are the perfect example of what a natural artist is. Stay real and ignore your haters because money can't buy what you have because it's either you have it or you don't  and girl you HAVE IT.    I love your tutorial I just start wearing makeup last year and I am still learning.. love your make up line
So cuteeeeee
You was fat? Or pregnant 🤰?
Her foundation is oranger than she is. She needs a pinker one.
Fenty beauty
I was born to love rihanna yeah I am a navy and I watch this video so that I do not forget her face every day I wish I could meet her by the way,
Yep
Was she high or something ?
Rihanna is gorgeous!!

She doesn’t even need make up. So pretty without it

THAT LIP GLOSS 😍😍😍😭😭😭
Too yellow but werk
It's really refreshing that she only used mascara and no falsies
I love RiRis makeup line. I scooped up the free makeup brush she recently promoted and my makeup looks like I came right off the red carpet! My pro filtr foundation hasn’t ever looked better on my skin. It just replaced my beauty blender.  bit.ly/mieokobrushes
Wow 10/10 would recommend
She didn't. Show. The bronzer. 😱✨✨✨✨✨ #upNext??? 😀

Lmao “very special nose”
"... and my nose contour, because I'm black you know 💙
"Always in my purse, and if it doesn't fit in my purse, I'm changing my purse" 😹💜
She is my favorite female artist. Rihanna is literally a queen 😍 she is so fun, down to earth, and in general a sweet and kind person. It is literally my dream to meet her 😂
Cadê o povo que fala português
QUEEN! 💜💜💜
I swear I love her!!😘😁
to aqui pelo Diogo Paródias kkkkk
eu só consigo pensar na paródia do diogo kakakakakajjj
she doesn't even need makeup lol
her hair looks disgusting
she looks like a alien without make up
QUEEN ❤
why am i not a rihanna;(
The thing is she really doesn’t need makeup
Kendalls video=2min.  Rihannas video=10min. Hxksnxj
Olha a pele dessa pessoa 😱😱😱
Life and soul - literally.
Riri you are the Best. You are so funny.  VOILÀ. Mdr
Your eyes are pretty
Alguém do Brasil aqui?!! Assistindo.❤😌
Hoooo elle a dit voilà en français
she’s so pretty i’m trash
the look really came together. lip gloss looks bomb
Actually in one of Jeffry Stars videos he does the same in the intro that he looks fat and doesn’t want to say hi and says that walking sucks
I love you
Rihanna+ Zara = Zarihanna
I wonder which shade of island bling she used for this video , does anyone know?
Did anyone else need to buy makeup and Rihanna helped me know what to get?
https://youtu.be/AU52CtaDEyg ❤️
Black skin

Gorgeous!!!
I love how she says contour 😍😍😍😍

*No one can rock a good HIGHLITGHTER and LIP GLOSS then RIRI👏*
rihanna really has a love for glitter...and i dont just mean that chunky glitter u get at the dollar store.. i mean the *"shine,sparkles on makeup and highlighters"*
I love her my god
dudee she looks stunning without makeup
She is amazing guuuuurll
2:20 tá vendo essa região aqui, ó gente, que vem daqui do queixo e vai descendo. Então, é aqui que você tem que apertar para sufocar as inimigas vagabundas. Kkkkkkk
É tão estranho escutar a voz original da Rihanna depois de assistir Diogoparodias kkkk
I could watch her allllllll day 😍❤️
The foundation doesn't macth her skin and this is WAY too much product for the skin. Definitely not the amount for normal ppl like us 😂  Love Riri❤️
Glad I don't wear make up! A little lip gloss nd eye liner does me just fine, and sometimes a lil eye shadow.. This is WAY too much.. Natural beauty is a blessing 💜
"Eu Quero Pão "kkkkkkkkk
She's beautiful and funny❤

なんかちょっと安室奈美恵に雰囲気似てる気がする
Her face is ORANGE WTF ????
Her skin is flawless AF😭
PLEASE ANSWER SOMEONE : Could you use the body lava on your face if you don't want to use all that concealer, bronzer, foundation, ECT. ???
Why did she make her face yellowish not judging just think she's more beautiful without makeup
shes relatable
What mascara did she use?
i love that she doesn’t promotes her product too much, she just wear it and looks good on her and people will eventually try to find the products that she’s wearing
Che bel bagno

I have a big forehead and it’s nice to know someone as pretty as her can pull it off so well. Makes me feel better about myself. I don’t wear makeup but I’m a HUGE skincare junkie
Isn’t her foundation too yellow?
She has a huge forehead
what lippy was that?????????????????
Queen of cooliness
She's just so perfect 😍
Rihanna ASMR
I love Rihanna but gurl this is not a ten minute routine, when it's speeded up.
Eu sou uma Baiana sksksk
Rihana u are petter than Niki minaja!
I never thought she was friendly or approachable. Not after this! I love her even more!
I like it when she said I have a huge forehead😂😂😂😂😂
Rihanna: hide that double chin Me: *takes a deep breath*          girl, whereeeee
I love her words 😭❤️❤️❤️ lover herr soo mucch
Why Rihanna had green eyes? Can someone tell my why

Cutie pie!👄 😘
It takes me 10 minutes to put on just primer, tinted moisturizer, blush and lip tint i swear...
I love you so much Rih ❤️
Rihanna's eyes are the best  🖤
Love that video, she's funny and natural. The make up is gorgeous. BUT, i never understand WHY people never do their neck. You can clearly see the colour difference ! It's like she's wearing a face mask !
Love you Rihanna ❤️
Omg she is so down to earth to be one of the biggest superstars of all time. Her voice is sooo soothing.
We going to the cleerrbb 💃🏽

"Summer, sunset , love, drama, BITCHES"😂
Wrong foundation shade
omg that difference between her face and her hand... :O
I’ve seen this so many times. This is by far the best makeup tutorial I’ve seen solely because it’s Rihanna. She just slays 👏👏👏

Rihanna is so real and I love her soo much
Riri: *i look kind of cute* Me: yOU’RE AN ACTUAL GODDESS WHAT DO YOU MEAN

Rihanna is one of those artists that I genuinely have never heard the speaking voice of until now and I honestly love it💞
I just know realize that's not a henna. Love this tho 😍
The Blend is real😭
That was the funniest tutorial I ever watch in my entire life! I love this woman so bad,  I am dead🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Luv this😊😊
My name is rihannah the same as your same pronunciation just spelled with a H my mom wanted it to be a little different
What bronzer did she use???
That was pretty cute!
ouvir a voz da Rihanna é a melhor parte🌈🙌🌈#BRAZIL
“Se for pra usar essas maquiagens de chumbo, eu prefiro tinta guache” hahahah
Wish she didn’t have all those tattoos.. can’t wait for the tattoo trend to be passé
She is literally LIFE AND HAPPINESS AND SELF-LOVE in one perfect bottle of human being.

FYI her foundation OXIDIZES

She looks better without makeup.
I am sorry not sorry but Rihanna's 10minute video Taught me more than most youtube tutorials!!
PQP que maravilhosa
DIOGO PARÓDIAS, EU TE AMO
In the beginning of the video I thought she had make up on already.  She is naturally pretty
Her tutorial was the only one I thoroughly enjoyed. It went on for a whole ten minutes and I didn't even realise.... I was kinda sad it was over lol
THIS GIRL MAKEUP LINE CRUSHED ALL THE BIG NAMES... AND LITTLE ONES!
Rihanna. You and I, we don't have foreheads. We have five!!!
Rihanna knows how to do the fish lips 😂😂😂😀😀💕😍😍
QUEEN
hi guys
https://youtu.be/pr7ojJD5_Og
Ugh she’s so gorgeous it’s starting to get annoying
her face is yellow
I fell in love with the lip gloss❤❤❤❤❤
How to change the color of your eyes ؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟
CL please :)
Does anyone know what concealer color she’s using?
It makes me feel better to see that Rihanna ALSO has creases under her eye.
The only thing me and riri have in common is our huge forhead. I'm LIVINGGGGGG for this rn
"My vibe for summer is: more is MORE " - my religion.
My face was literally the same as her on the lip gloss part lol
u look good without makeup
Girl double chin? PLEASE

I'm sorry but her face is super golden and doesn't match her body colour at all, even and especially at the end of the video..

The way she says contour is so adorable.
OMG she's so so so cute!!!!!
I want her to be a youtuber now 😂
I never noticed that Rihanna had “a big forehead” until she pointed it out... but she doesn’t have a big forehead, I know someone who has a shrunk face but a ginormous forehead.
Queen Riri
Queen
-When you realize you looking like a snack- (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
What a beautiful soul ♥️
Diva de mais, ce loko!

You are so funny...😂I love your humor❤❤🔥🔥🌚🌞
Somebody please tells me where to find this lip gloss🤤😍
Babeee ❤️
Rihanna sunbaenim
"Hide that double chin..." 😂😂😂
She's so beautiful!❤
“Beach please * Snaps fingers * Beach PLEASE get it” she’s too much 😂
Rihanna is too Funny 😂
I still don't know what we did to deserve this video
Icon
but why does not Quentin call you to make movies? It would be nice!
you're funny as Tarantino
Follow my blog about Italy
Personally Think she’s overrated. Girl can’t even match her foundation to her beck
I love you!!!
"EU SOU A BAIANNA!!!"
Love her
“Because I’m black...that’s a very special nose”. 🤪🤪🤪Icon. 💖😍
I love her...
4:40 so cute😂
The foundation, it’s not your shade. ☹️
"VOILÀ" mdrr 😂 Je l'adooore
She is so cute
Now I want to be friends with her
Rihanna looks like new york ..
I love me some RiRih. One of her biggest fan with ur pretty self!! xoxoxoxo
Her foundation so yellow. Like egg
Either way rihanna you look pretty the way you are and you always will be PLUS you always were...am I right???
that foundation is too yellow for her skintone
Her foundation doesn’t match her neck!!!
love you Ri Ri!
the colour of foundation is totally wrong, gosh it's orange
so relieved the foundation oxidised by the end
U have a wrong base skin tone
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love how she gets more energetic as she applies more makeup. It really does change your point of view when you feel pretty.
She seems so down to earth. Not awkward at all like kim Kardashian. She's too stiff sometimes.
I swear she can rock anything, whether it’s a different style of clothes or a different lipstick color😍.
Super!
I just love her
Rihanna should make her own YouTube channel and do like makeup tutorials and like asmr
wut happened 2 her accent
"i learned how to contour when i gained weight" lmfao i love her sm
I feel like Rihanna is my mom 😂 she knows EVERYTHING!!! 😂
My name is rihanna
Foundation tone 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
👍🏿
Great rollmodel for kids... you're the most beautiful person on the web, and the first sentence that leaves your mouth in this video is: I look fat!.... why!?!!?
шея розовая ,лицо жёлтое)
Living for how real she is.so much 💖
SHE NEEDS TO DROP HER SKINCARE ROUTINE UGH

Wonderful! Come and see my last Rihanna cover on my profile!☺ and suscribe if you like it! Take care!💜
Your gorgeous with make up and without it😘
She's so beautiful and this video is so iconic 😍😍
Rhianna is an icon and a beauty. She's so charismatic and relatable and I genuinely love her
Can someone let me know what lipstick she is using at the end please?Looks pink but can’t find it online!
the only thing that bothers me about this is the fact that she used the wrong shade of foundation AND DIDNT EVEN BLEND IT DOWN HER NECK
I hate the way she applied the highlighter , it looks heavy and not good for those who have large pores
this is so cute??? i love rihanna even more now.
"Eu quero PÃO!"
She is so beautiful🌟🌟
I find this video so relaxing! I love the ways she talks, it’s such in a calm way❤️
I dream to but fenty make up  haven't try yet till now

I don’t want to be rude or anything but did anyone else notice how big Rihanna’s forehead is. I STILL LOVE HER THOO!!!
beautiful <3 i wish she coverd her neck with make up too so it doesnt stand out much . but who cares !! it's riri people!!! im gonna try her products soon. they seem to blend very easily .

The foundation seemed to oxidize, it matched her skin more towards the end
When ur friends with anna wintour.. Lots of fashion connections and promotions.  Even though shes not beautiful and fashionable like models.  It doesnt matter.
She is fabulous 😍
Diva 😍💖
I like her now
Just one big advert for her own line.

Sugaryyyy
dont forget to put some makeup on your neck too and also setting spray! shine bright!!! you're beautiful like diamonds in the sky!

She looks so beautiful and yes she really knows lots of stuffs! It makes me wanna try fenty products 😄
funny woman <33
¡Love You GirL! ⚘ 🖒😍🙏
I love the make up 😍😍😍

Can Riri make up my life kthxbye
Omg I love her 😍
Wow she’s really insecure
If Rihanna dropped more music she’s honestly better than Beyoncé, hands down. Prettier, sexier. Stop praising Beyoncé because everybody else she’s ugly nothing compared to queen riri
I love her so much wow
Alguém do Brasil da up aí riri te amoooo sua gostosoaaaa
this is a real make up line. not like the K bitches children make up
Mano eu n acredito q ela disse q estava parecendo gorda no início, espero ter escutado errado pq ME POUPE amo ela porém é ridículo ela falar isso
Who is Nikki Tutorials close to this queen????
0:10  10:00
I didn’t even relize she wasn’t wearing makeup in the beginning x_x riri stop being so flawless
I think that’s Rihanna looks so beautiful without makeup
literally my queen.😭
2:02 omg how she does that first I knew how to do like her but now I cant
She is such a lovely and beautiful girl, and her skin is amazing! but the foundation is too yellow for her, how did that happen!!?
She is so gorgeous without makeup oh my god😭😭
Love love love love!  💖
Gurl you ain't fat
*Put foundation on her face, only forehead left*   „k let‘s do the other half of my face“ lmao i love her
A superstar
Idc her foundation is orange.
She's really nice😍❤️
Is she losing her accent or is it not as strong before?
😍😍
Yas Rihanna

Umm ....anyone notice her face doesn’t even match her neck
Preciosa, divertida, hermosa mujer <3

Why she so gorgeous?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
QUEEN❤️💗💗💗💗💗💗

was I the only one that thought the concealer didn't cover up her dark circles very well
"it only takes me long when.. I'm procrastinating..." - Rihanna ~
am I the only one who think the color she use is wrong? too yellow-ish?
Rihanna being relatable for 10 mins straight
⚠Ok holup ⚠ Whatt I miss? Did she just say she has another product out? 😶😮
日本人です！リアーナ愛してる！
lookin like *S N A C C*
For everyone wondering what the lipgloss is it's a Fenty Lipgloss: https://www.fentybeauty.com/summer-daze-summer-nights/iridescent-lip-luminizer-trio/FB40009.html?dwvar_FB40009_color=FB4035 it's the pink one
She is so pretty. And the way she says contour 💕 Im fan girling
I love riri so much but I try not to idolize her or her music, because unfortunately she sold her soul and worships the devil😕
Step 1) Be Rihanna and look amazing without makeup...
What lipstick was that???!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
What happened to your accent it’s gone :(
SHE IS EVERYTHING. MY GOD SHE'S STUNNING
This was the best tutorial I’ve ever watched!
"Where we goin tonight???" "We goin to the Clurb!" LOL  Love her!
Living for this honestly I was just listening to your voice (the level of chill I aspire to be)
Rihanna has such natural beauty thooo
Omg did she really say that she has a huge forehead?😂😂😂
If she has a double chin, I have a quadruple chin.
LoL, something new.
What lipgloss does she use
“No I look fat” #relatable
It was a pleasure watching this video. Your personality just shined through😍😍😍
She's gorgeous
I love this so much!!!! I’m a Rhianna fan for her music but this is the most I’ve ever watched of just her and her personality. I would have never thought she did her own makeup like EVER!!! Lol. She seems so sweet and relatable. Love Love Love 💕
this is everything
5:43 you're welcome
Can anyone tell what product she has used on her shoulder?
Love... Love... this tutorial... thanks for keeping it real...Love you too RiRi
SHES SO CUTE

I feel there exists a great way to find out more about beauty tips. Go to google and search: "Blast4beauty". You will get lot of new ideas to enhance your beauty.
Beautiful I love your make up line. Your definitely an inspiration in everyway!!! ✌❤💯
Her face yellow tho... Rihanna... wrong shade gurl.
Rihanna. is ideal face. Whay are you need m_up?
Rihanna is a queen. Enough said.
I liked her before makeup added
Is that the right foundation for her skin tone?   I'm not an expert on the subject, but she suddenly became orange somehow.
Love her amazing video
She’s gorgeous 😍😍😍
" I look kinda cute " GURL U LOOK AMAZING
I would’ve loved to see her brows too ! ❤️
am i the only one who thinks the foundation tone doesn't suit her skin colour?
9:21 whath is?
This is so cute😊😊
OVERRATED
just staring at her like im in love. i think if i met this woman i would have a stroke tbh
A melhor Rihanna esplendorosa arrasa
we going to the clurrb 😍
everyone talk about her foundation, but wait until the end of the video. She looks pretty flawless. In my opinion the foundation oxidize
I want to be Rihannas friend. So refreshingly relatable and cool!
YAH NEED TO GET THIS TO TEN *MILLION* VIEWS ASAP
Could any girl please tell me what have she done with her hair? How it looks like this!
Yes! I just wanna go buy the rest of the Fenty products I don’t have now. Great job RiRi girl.

No disrespect but I know it's not a question to ask a woman but if you're already beautiful why do you need to cover it up with makeup.
My lady crush💟
Which cosmetic brand does she use?
That was everything!!!.... I could watch it a million times and still not get enough.

There is no one like riri.badass girk

I wanna know her story about what happened with her and Chris Brown
Cute
I love her and she’s so pretty but her face doesn’t match her neck, she’s too orange/yellow. Is it just me?
HUAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*this woman is literally gorgeous*
9:03 Did she just said "والله" ? 😂😭💘
I'm gonna honest.  All these make up so called guru's failed to get me to buy anything that they were selling or reviewing.   Until this video.  I'm buying all that she used in this video.
9:15 when a boy is trying to test my patience
she says contour like Laura Lee i’m screaming
Not that the make up wasn't good but even if she did crappy make up I'd still love it simply cuz it's Rihanna😂
Legenda para o Brasil pleaseeeeeeee 😢
I think beauty is in you and we shouldn't be wearing makeup I don't wear makeup and beauty does not count in makeup and pls subscribe to my friend kimmy shade or kimora kimora shade
My wife looks good

Ri is so sweet. Her personality is the bomb
Awww, she's so cute))
Such a beautiful girl
what a queen
0:26 Why did she roll her tongue on the "r" in "All of you Vogue readers"?
I love her robe and her makeup and everything about her 🙌🏽💕
Her foundation doesn’t match her skin
I love this
Wow
I love you  ay alicia

I WANT HER TO MAKE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL!!!!
Beauty gurus are SHAKING
love
Loved it 😘😘😘😘😘
What is the lip gloss that she used?
she's so beautiful without makeup 😍
She is orange !
I feel the Carribean Vibe and also look...
There is an airport on her forehead
Rihanna can you just be my bff? She is SOOOO CUTEEEEE haha
What a perfect human. I also love how she keeps reiterating that certain looks are for certain people and you need to find out what's best for YOU, because what looks good on someone else won't necessarily look good on your face too.
do only I think that colour of foundation is not for her skin tone?
i need to know what she uses for her lashesssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😍😍 bomb
Her foundation is orange compared to her skin tone! Nevertheless, she’s created a makeup brand !
This video makes me feel like i should do videos and learn how to edit because i see videos like this and see the magnificent flaws amd mistakes the editor of the video did.
Ure so ugly rihanna
But do we really actually deserve Rihanna?
make a beauty vloger hehe😍
You are such a fun person, love that super simple makeup 👍
I don’t even like makeup tutorials but this was worth watching 😍
Queen
an icon
I love you rihanna
I got pregnant just by watching this
What a gorgeous look <3
OMG, hahaha y really really love her 😂😍 she's so funy! 💓💗
You are so beautiful.
SHE SO BEAUTIFUL WITH AND WITHOUT MAKEUP
I have been using arganrain shampoo and oil for my beauty I am really satisfied
The world is not worthy of Rihanna, honestly this woman is too precious.
She has her face orange with her makeup 😂
Rihanna is such a goddess😍😍
She’s sooo cute!!! 😊 Love Rihanna ❤️❤️❤️
great make up
Her hair 😍
she's so funny and  opened 😂
I love you rihhana
her eyes<3
that girl has a air conditioner in the bathroom
🐊😂
This makeup is hideous...... sorry Rihanna, yucky
She's definitely not a natural beauty, she has very hard features.... not very lady like....
'As bicha pira hmmmm nas minhas makes' hahahaha ❤
She seems so... normal O.o
She must be a really funny person! I love her...
I Luv  It .  ore uploads PLease  !
❤❤❤
Her Skin tone is absolutly different than makeup 😮 and yeah makeup is fun  😊 i love this look especially  lava and Amazing lip gloss 😍 but I dont know if it Will looks same on my lips😔
She’s so funny😂😂
Your beautiful girl
She is the best ✨✨✨queen 👑👑
I loved it
When she puts her lip gloss on!!  ^o^
i love you rihanna
I mean Rihanna is an Angel 😇 walking on Earth 🌏
Rihanna could wear actual mud and crushed berries on her face and it would still look better than us mortals.
I love how natural she is... no nosejobs or lip injections
Within seconds she says this is how I do my makeup first is foundation” shoot I thought she already had her makeup on but no it’s just her beautiful face without makeup😍😍😘
You are so beautiful both  on the outside and the inside. Stay true to your self.
why is she so perfect? fenty beauty is everything
The voice is so soothing especially with her accent
I love you soooooooooooooooo much Rihanna loveeeeeee meh pls
She has a giant brow my God that ugly
i👏🏻love👏🏻her👏🏻
Can she live stream doing her makeup every morning? I would watch that every morning. She is the best!
What highlighter did she use on her eyes
What highlighter is that 😭
Eh not really her shade it still turned out cute tho 💜
Ugh, she's so genuine, down  to earth, and real. Fun and funny! I love her.
I would do this exact thing...but, ONLY Rhianna can pull this look and look so flawless. Natural beauty!! She sounds like my mom when she says "De Body Lava" 9:26
The face is orange not until she put the contour, the powder, the bronzer and such. She knows how her look would end up. Who's the one who owns a make up line, it's Riri and not u she knows her mathafckin shade.
Her brows though
Hey guys! Can you guys sub to my friend Cassidy Peña. She has a yellow jacket on in her profile picture and she is really awesome!
Love her 💖💖😩😩
concealer doesn't match her skin color.
love it
Finally only black people makeup
No entendi mi miércoles lo que dijo, pero lo vi completo nada mas por verla es tan hermosa 😍
While you’re warming the product you’re waisting a lot of it. Not cool. Unicorn is really hard to apply
Everything just looked terrific on her!! Beautiful
The bestttt make-up tutorial.. 😍👌
I love the way she says "Contour"❤😂
"10 minutes"
Lol Drake got dissed
i love her !!! what an icon
Miss Rihanna Robyn Fenty is absolutely gorgeous, this girl better not get hurt

Does anybody know wat contact Ri is wearing
my name is amyah and i am 8 now my  birthday is april 25 2010
i love you rihanna you are so beautiful rihanna
Enjoyed the video but that hand tattoo is so tragic
I come back to watch this everyday when I feel sad
a queen
My mom named me after her 😍😍😍😍
But there is a huge difference between the  color of your face and your skin
I've never been a Rihanna fan but this video made me fall in love (although I'm not sure about that foundation shade)
Rihanna is the most perfect girl ever
I love how she just goes at it with the highlighter
Rihanna is so relatable.... what an icon
Before:  0:06 after:  10:18
sooooo she doesnt use her primer
why would you wanna look like an oily mess?
8:56 😍❤
i love her so much my gorgeous queen
Okay she is just down right adorable!  A makeup tutorial that is simple , fun and to the point.
She's the most beautiful funniest woman ever love it
40 shades of foundation..... what happened here lol
OMG she's so funny she said hide that double chin
awesome ....my dear 👌👍👍👍👍
ughhhhh i love her
Easiest makeup tutorial like everr.
She's pretty without makeup💜
The makeup was a bit much.....but that's a part of her vision of sensuality.....she doesn't need it.....she showed a lot of her personality...and she was TONS.. of fun......LOVE HER !!!!
“Rihanna can’t wink” Actually the wink can’t Rihanna
I didn't come for an asmr video
Proud of this fap
She is soo cute ❤😍
Elle a dit voila
https://youtu.be/hMQWtDyP9Mk
Lol the fenty foundation obviously oxidzes. It was way too yellow on her initially. the countour stick on the other hand is too ashy and neutral on her....
💜✨Cuuteee 🌸💜💗
It must be illegal to be this cute 😍😍😍😍
Man this is totally unbelivable, she is gorgeous
I’ve been watching all these makeup tutorials when I really should’ve been watching RiRi.
anyone know what bra she’s wearing? it’s hella cute
Oh god! How much i love this woman, her makeup is stunning
QUEEN!!!
BEAUTIFUL
Its her own make up and she doesnt apply the right shade and the contour is not dark enough...

OMG PEOPLE!!!! The pallets she uses at 05:30 & 07:20 I need these in my life!!  Are these new??? Can’t find them on the Fenty website!!

Her personality n shes beautiful..i loved her back in the pon de replay years
Robyn!!!! i love you!!!!You are so COOL!!!
Alguém traduz esse vídeo pro português, PLEASEEEEEEEEEE
That forehead.. gottdamn
😍😍😍😍
I love how she acknowledges that she has a big forehead... lol Even the most gorgeous women and seemingly perfect women have flaws and things that they are insecure about!
WHAT IS THAT LIPCLOSS
She. Is. Perfect.  Such. A. Goddess.
I personally think its not worth all the effort and time. Youre pretty already.. A lil powder lipstick should have did the job
Ohh Grl. You preetuy without it!
https://youtu.be/IU0IYoFIeLA
What lipgloss did she use!!? Anyone know?
Just seening her face makes me wanna cry im so happy btw I have been listening to your music since I was 2 I LOVE YOU !!!😁😆
How is Rihanna, of all people, more normal and relatable than a lot of beauty gurus?
She looks beautiful natural 😘
I thought she already had makeup on and was gonna wipe it off to show her routine but no she’s just ridiculously good looking
RIRI your pretty without makeup or with makeup  gurl you slayy!
pls pls do more!!
Beautiful just beautiful...!!!!🖤
Queen QUEEEEENNN
She is sooo beautiful😩
Cool video but why you unfriend Drizzy?
I love your voice and music 🎶 it suits me
Drake’s drooling
I feel like she’s gonna come out with a brow product and if she doesn’t she should cuz that would be 😍
لو هالسعودي متزوج داليا مبارك ابرك له على الاقل احلى منها 😰😰
hahaha shes looks like a carrot, too orange!
Shes soooo fun no draaaama omg
I am your fan!
3:00
ok i just can't get over this video i rewatched it- nvm I lost count how much times I watched this
Wow she’s so beautiful and adorable and relatable and perfect wow
And if it doesn’t fit in my purse then I’m getting a new purse
Bravo
That's what you call 1 kilo of make up on your face. So better be natural and treat your body better, lead a healthy life.
Omg she so real i luv her
Her bare face got me like: natural make-up goals 😍 then she started applying foundation.... Can we all agree that she looks flawless with no make-up on?
Everything is great except for foundation color it is too yellowish and her face does not match her neck color
Shes so pretty already😍😍😍
Another look for darker skinned ladies that looks great on cheeks is a medium tone burgundy mixed with a bronze gold..then a champagne highlighter on cheek bones ,,etc😃👍
Her face is orange, really?!
I have avoided this Fenty section ever since it got launched, well after this video I feel like getting ready jump in my car and buy half of the things she put on
Awwww she is a natural artist at anything she touches it becomes beautiful like herself
Goshhh she's so cool ^^
???
what's the name of the lip gloss
Her personality is everythinnngggg
this was on my b day !!!
Omg I Love Her Personality ❤😖
I Luv your contouring/highlighting  skills made easy, awesome.
I didn't know that she was so funny 😂💜
Am I the only one who is sooo bothered by the fact that her face is completely yellow because of the foundation shade she uses, while the rest of her body is more of a pinkish/redish toned brown? I mean I know that it is a common technique amongst black women to use a lighter, more yellow toned foundation on the middle part of the face to brighten it, but using it all over just creates a "floating head" effect on her... at least for me... :-/
she is beautiful, but why is her foundation such a orange colour?? you can see the difference of colour between her and the foundation.
I love RIRI!!!
She beautiful and real but that foundation is WAY off. Does not match her neck. I'll give her props cuz most of these celebrities go based on what make up artists do for them, but knowing the technique is only have of the slaying game.
stunning she is beautiful.
Crazy fights on our page for
5:21 *yes girll*
Her skin is so clear i need her to drop a skin routine...ugg she so perfect
Contours start looking crazy 😆

Queen <3

7:02 the cutest thing ever💟💟
Dem fat dAYZZZZ

Concealer is made for hiding bad decisions
my family and i recently went on a cruise and one of the ports was barbados and as we were driving around on a tour they showed us the street she lived on and they named it after. That’s like the kindest thing EVER
Testa tem
“Everybody knows concealer is made for hiding bags, dark circles, and hangovers, and bad decisions” yess girllll👏🏼💗
Do you know what would Really be awesome is if You guys would list  the make up that she used, and where to get it. 💃🏻👄
I love her more and more every second
she's so chill, ahh, I love! <33
Her voice reminds me of stepping on crunchy snow.
Haha. Really enjoyed this one. I love Rihanna..
Vogue i need one with Bebe Rexha
Rihanna is soo beautiful‼️ I love her so much
She’s so funny 😍
If she had a beauty channel... I would be here for it lol.
Who need gurus when you got my gal Rihanna
Which lip gloss does she use here?!
Rihanna is just too pretty
Te amo riana😈
Song on background?)
Rihanna is so cute, I love her
I'm gonna start with a pink on the lids.... because it says  "summer"  "sunset" "love" "drama" 'BITCHES' I love her so much lmaoo
عوع 🤮
I love Rihanna. She is best! 😍
she's so genuinely beautiful
rihanna acting like she did not have makeup on before she started the tutorial
She's so cute..but wtf, that foundation is like 1-2 tones lighter than her natural colour, and yellowish...dunno. Kinda weird.
❤️🌹
I Love you Rihanna ❤❤❤❤❤
"cuhntour"
Simpatica
who else watched this video for like a hundred times?
That foundation does not match ya neck girl oof. Still love it tho
Rihanna ASMR please
This video has a very long ad...it's about 10:28 minutes
No makeup needed
What lip gloss is that?
"I'm gonna start with pink on the lids, because it says summer ... Sunset ... Love ... Drama ... BITCHES"
Shade to chris brown concealer is to hide bad decisions
rihanna is a mood
I watch this video every time I do my makeup now
SHE SO CUTE BITCHESSSSS!
More is more!
Did she use primer or setting spray?🤔
i need her and Cardi B in an interview.  they both look so fun to watch when they talk.
Am i the only one who noticed that the foundation doesn't match her skin because its literally yellow?  Edit: Btw I LOVE Rihanna so no hate❤
Why is she  highlight her bags under your eyes with so dark eyуshadow???
i reckon it would be hella easy to just talk to her in public without feeling awkward
2:20 - illuminati confirmed
Best video ever, omg!
Lol when she screamed after the lip gloss my cat jumped lol
Beautiful 😭❤️
I almost never watch make-up videos without doing something else at the sime time, but this time... I did. Never knew Rihanna was human too! Love it
I sometimes wonder if she even understands how beautiful she is... ;)
never mind she had her cousin sacrificed.. oh ..she is so wonderful
Summer , sunset , love , draaamaa , bitchesss ! Lol !
She was trying too hard sorry
Which brand of the lip gloss is that? Someone knows that?
“No i look fat”  😂😂😂😭😭 i love her
“More is more” lol Rihanna I freaking love you
🤔So you just not gone do yo neck,#done 🤗
This is honestly my first time hearing her speak.
we stan one legend
She’s sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo pretty ❤️❤️❤️❤️
She’s so beautiful and exotic... flawless skin even without makeup 😍
I love her so much this was a joy to watch, she is so cute and her voice is soothing af
I love you riri😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do more! You have talent ❤
Yall have been brainwashed. Im so sad for this society man....
I think she looks just as beautiful before the makeup. It's a shame that so many women think they need to go through all this.
this is like asmr to me lmfao
4:20 "Procrastinating" LOL we all know she meant to say "High af"
I loveeeee Rihanna
Her natural light, yet bronzy skin tone is so beautiful though! Why use such a different shade of foundation? Can anyone give me their thoughts on this?
Face and shoulders look pretty, but wish she had brought her foundation down her neck, since the foundation didn't quite match.
Ooh, that is NOT the right foundation tone.
why she's really gorgeous? 😭💗
Just a naughty and baaad baaaad girl! Well done! She is sweetie.
It feels good to know that even Kween Riri cant match her foundation to her neck😂
"My vibe for summer is: more is more"-Badgalriri   wow
WE LOVE A BEAUTY GURU
I love it babyyyyyyy
I like how she knows what she's doing but she's not too picky she is creative and plays with it
She's so adorable..this is like the 10 time i see this video😍 Love u ririii❤💋

Hey Rihanna how about some fenty music? 😑

That foundation is too orange for her! It doesn't match!
qUEEN 🙌🏻😍
Anyone know what lip gloss that is?
I love you Rihanna
She is so awesome. She is adorable in a realistic simple way and so SOOOOO beautiful
Wow that was the fastest contour ever lol. I look kinda cute 😸
Rihanna is gorgeous, with or without makeup.
Why is she not doing this! Girl slay
She is so beautiful and her make up looks gorgeous. However, I do feel like her foundation isn't a good match. The foundation makes her face appear more orange than her neck.
When will some of those products be out??? 😍
omggg i love her sm
Eu quero PÃOO!
Lol 8:48 and the body lava pump “it’s new” face 🙌🏻🤗🤣🤣

"Voila" awww so cute you speak french ?:3
I really want to know what eyelashes she is wearing here ❣️🙏🏻
Her accent is disappearing:(
Love you Ri Ri. You are the best..
Nice but I can still see the concealer under her 👀

I laughed alot. And my mother asks me why i've been obsessing about Rihanna since primary school lol
Does anyone know the name of the lip gloss she used?
Anyone know what the lipgloss is that she’s using?
her foundation is too yellow for her skin
“I couldn’t find a perfect body lava so I had to make it for u bitches”
I liked her eyes there pretty
Muy hermosa me gustó este video

« VOILA » I love her!! XD
Bu kadın muazzam üstad... ☄
God RiRi is so freaking cute!!
Her natural beauty has me shooketh .
I adore her♡
Rihanna could low key be a beauty guru without the drama
I wish i was rihanna
Beauty gurus are gone. cancelled. snatched. deceased. shooketh to the core. The Queen has arrived.
Rihanna HONESTLY needs tp become the next big YouTube Beauty Guru
beautifullllllllllllllllll
I love her way too much😍😍
I bet she smells like magical fairies and weed💖
I LOVE this so much!

*"love...drama...BITCHES"*
summer, sunset, love, drama, *BITCHES* 😂😂
makeup guru's are shaking
That voice. Too much cigarettes and alcohol to me. Nothing similar with studio voice.
Rihanna wear wig or is that her real hair, just asking if anyone know
petition for rihanna to become a yotuber [i wish she could be she's so busy doing other stuff]
she's so cute when she's laughing

OMFDDD QUEEENN MUA WHOOO!?!?!STR A MF TY CHNNEL BOO💖💖💖💖WCE
She’s so cute
Why is she so adorable though?!
She always got a whole squad/entourage with her
I wish she had shown how she did her eyebrows bcus hers are perf 😩😩
Try to name a more iconic person
y de repente un comentario en español
wow what a queen
She reminds me of carli bybel
Bu videoyu dünyanın sonuna kadar izleyebilirim
I just love this girl
I love the way she says “contour” 😩😂😍😍
'if this doesn't fit my purse, i change my purse' QUEEN
That's too much crap on your face. How do you wear that in heat? What do you wash your face with to remove it? No thanks. Tew merch. Natural life.
She did it all w/one brush and a tiny beauty blender. I see these girls on yt w/a million and one brushes and their makeup 💄 still doesn't look as good and effortless as Rihanna's. 🤷🏽‍♀️😩
omgggg Wish I could be like you❤️U so beautiful
I love how close she gets to the camera. Like, she’s not scared. No youtuber gets that close to their camera!
YES RIRI
She is so adorable 😂” I learned how to contour when I got fat “
SOLD !!!!
She needs to start a YouTube channel
... but there's no info on the makeup you used!😢
This video makes me so happy for some reason 😍
😍😍😍
Bob Ross 2.0
Rihanna doesn't need make up 😘
James Charles is shaking
..."LASHES" 😍.
With or without make up she's just amazing beautiful!
I already have my makeup brands that I would never change, but after this video I couldn´t help it... I ran to the store and buy this stuff, my skin color is more or less like her so I went crazy with her products! beautiful amazing color range I have to say!!!!!
Que molleja de bella es Rihanna! No necesita maquillaje, es perfecta!

I did not know I could love her any more but I do, I love her more.
The fact the mirrors aren’t symmetrical to each their bothers me sm omg
Riri, I don’t now if it was the camera filter, but I think the foundation undertone is wrong for your skin color. It’s too yellow. I had to mix fenty foundation to make my perfect color. By the way, Thank you so much for your wonderful beauty line...
Bby queen 🙏😍
I need to know what gloss that is??
I think her face is too orange...
The type of woman I'd be friends with

I can’t stop watching this😍😍😍
Mannn I just love her so much
For someone with a successful makeup line, showcasing her own products in a tutorial for Vogue, her foundation should match her neck and chest much better than what it does, period.
I can watch this everyday
“When she says I feel kinda cute!” Girl stop playing you’re a GODDESS!!!.
Best makeup video ever 😚😚😚😚😚😑😍😍😍😍😍😍
Beautiful face structure..... even without make.   you're awesome!!!!

Best 10 minutes in my life

BEAUTY GURUS ARE SHOOK.

Her voice sounds just like kathleen lights

« Voilà » 😍
But guys Rihanna doesn't need make up be real hahahahaha
She is so pretty  ri ri my girl 😍✌🏾
Okay I’m actually obsessed with her
She looked like a female version of Will Smith. Too pretty. What could be better than Riri giving tutorial.
am i the only one who noticed she was introducing a lot of new products for her line ahdhdjfkfkd
Love rhianna but Her face doesnt match her neck at all 😧
Yes, looove you
Queen 😍❤️
Why so pretty Riri?😊
Who dislikes this video omg I love her
Rihanna is just so gorgeous & classy, love her makeup & music 💋
Wow I loved your video and just love you
Omg i love her laugh😂😂😂😂😂
Cuteeee>33333333
Diogo parodia
She seems like a very friendly person to hangover with
RIHANNA IS SO ANNOYINGLY PRETTY
Idk why girls like looking so sweaty!! A nice lite summer glo..ok but to look like your melting NAH
What gloss is that?? 😍😍
Hi SHHH
WoW and all i do us just rub Vaseline on my face ... Girls are Amazing - lol
her bathroom is 2 times bigger than my bedroom s2g
one word: ICONIC
“More is more”  ~riri
Love ❤️
This is the best vogue video
I love her voice
OMG RiRi!!! Living, breathing and DYING for this look-(and all of your others!) PLEASE, the world needs a RiRi makeup and self confidence tutorial YouTube channel!!! I was worried about how yellow the foundation looked to start with, but it turned out absolutely beautiful! Thankyou so much RiRi, and Vogue!!!!
"It says summer, sunset, love, drama..... BITCHES!
So nice to see such a big star do their own makeup and do an amazing job of it too! I love her,shes just so down to earth :)
this background music is so rihanna does anyone feel me
Favorite makeup tutorial ever
Even all the concealer in the world couldn't cover my eye bags lol.  But the good news is that in Korea, eye bags are considered cute and if you watch Korean makeup tutorials they love to emphasize the anglo sac with white eyeliner (with the exception of youtuber Pony Syndrome).
Everyone is saying her foundation is too dark for her. First her foundation dries and it matches her skin better. Second we all know Rihanna does a lot of photoshoots I mean the video is for Vogue the camera flash always makes the foundation look a lot brighter. And 3 she clearly said she was sun burnt so her skin color is not the normal color. You can’t sit in your cheap 1 bedroom apt and tell a legend how to do her makeup “beach please”
Rihanna is queen!!!❤️
Bye bye beauty gurus Rihanna just took your place 😍😂👋
What lipstick did she use?
No wonder why she da queen
7:22 I reversed this part like 10 times because I couldn't believe this
I NEED more Makeup Tips by Rihanna!! 😍🌸💋
Love her
my god she's so cute haha
Too much high light
I JUST LOVE HER
I have nothing against fat people but she particularly doesn't look good when she's fat.
Ok, what was she blending along her bottom lash line right before she applied blush?!
Can she make a YouTube channel?! 😭😩 I think we all need it.
She gives me confidence to rock my 5 head:)
She's so Beautiful, She's so funny
Naturally Beautiful I Luv Ri Ri's Eyes
😄🙈
So this is basically an advertisement of her new Fenty products ook
Wowww
Rihanna is so beautiful and down to earth. Who knew angels exists and one of them is doing a make up tutorial for us. 😍😇
Taylor Swift should do one video like this doing her natural makeup look
I miss her Barbados accent.
Is foundation supposed to make your face bright yellow. She looks like sponge bob
Always gotta bring colour into it. Yaaaawn. 💤💤💤💤💤
Her contour looks a little gray before she blended it out
I love  rihanna
Rihanna needs to open her own MUA channel on YouTube
And why does she need make up? ❤️❤️❤️💗🤗😻😻
Her foundation doesn’t match
Is she serious...If I was her I'd go out without make-up everyday!

she is one of the biggest influences for us younger mixed girls. she inspires us to love how we look and enjoy being different and being ourselves even though we are raised in a society that has taught us that European is beauty and we are not.
Some people call me Rihanna because my name is Brianna

Scrolling through the comments to see if anyone noticed how she says contour
She is just the cutest I swear 💜
This is not 10 minutes. They cut out the part where her brows are done. Also editing but her look still looks nice.
queen❤❤👑👑
honey do you want to hide your bags or nah ? LMFIGSKDOSO
8:40 me testing products at Sephora. Lmao I love her 😂
Yasss Rihanna you so should do make up videos ❤️ I mega loved this with my everything ❤️❤️❤️ I would faint if you liked a picture of me on Instagram Yessenia_Garcia_Mua or commented on one of my Tutorials❤️
I love her voice
I am liiiiving for this ❤
At first I use to wonder why people were so crazy about her. But after this video. She seemed more human then celebrity like. Her stating her flaws made me feel more relatable to her. And I love how she made a makeup line good enough for our dark skin girls. She's pretty cool
I will never stop re-watching this!!! THANK. U. JESUS FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN!!! WHATTTT!!!!????

I enjoyed her so much even I’m not a girl, million girls out there could relate to her. She is so humble and girl next door Wish you good luck Rihanna, you always were, are and will be my favourite
So cute I luv her 😍😍😘
Her skin is so pretty, no need for foundation.
The way she says “contour” 😍
Fat is beautiful. To anyone out there, own your double chin. You are super cool
Who you going to see girl Hassan Jamel?Mmmhhmm💅🏽
No hate towards Rihanna, but Fenty has what, like 40-50 different shades of foundation and she couldn't find one to match her skin tone?
She’s so beautiful and amazing
It helps she that she has perfect skin 😇😇
Her voice gives me ASMR. Also that lip gloss GIRRL, that's the content I signed up for
No i look fat lol i love her
i wish the product names she used were listed
O rany!te pędzle , kosmetyki ...ich cenę chciałabym poznać .

She's so cute 💜💜
She's gorgeous in everything  That vibe giiirl! Queen 👑!!!!!!!
She’s so pretty with and without makeup I literally could not tell the difference between her with makeup and without makeup 😍😍😂
I LOVE RIHANNA JUST SO MUCH
jesus shes amazing
Just how make up is supposed to be used, to enhance not disguise. A beautiful lady who is very natural, see you tubers the contour was only a little darker than her skin tone, and the concealer wasn't all over the centre  of the face,  lovely, I'm going to have a go and believe me I look nothing like the beautiful Rihanna, but I can look a better me.
Complain ( a right one) about the lack of darker shades in a bunch of make up brands, and then RiRi used a light concelear. WTF. Sorry for my english
Can someone please let me know which lip-gloss she's using??? It's gorgeous!!
Dolllll omg
If Rihanna looks fat how do I look?
She's so beautiful!!
I love you rihanna ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wrong shade of foundation and it shows when you look at her face then her neck
so wait like is she making a powder bronzer named finesse?!?
une déesse 😍❤️
I would be honored to sit all day and watch Rihanna do make up
I love the way she says contour omg
Rihanna is so cool and lovable 😍
This is me when I'm high doing my makeup 😂😂 I love her ❤❤
What kind of lipgloss is that? What color? MUST HAVE!!!
Dude Rihanna's face glowsss the heck is her skin care routine?!
shes got such a comfortable energy around her i love it
i think that Rihanna forgot she has a music career!!!!!
Looking fat is ok, yenno. But whatever x
I love how a megastar like you can still be so shy and humble 😘
Jfc..if I could wear what she's wearing and STILL look natural. .yes,natural. .not frigging fair! Killed it!
Please collab with Jeffree Star... Please
Google.com
10:03:ASMR
she's so adorable and cute im doneeeeee
EU QUERO PÃO!
shameless self promo
I thought she was perfect n then i saw she applies highlight like a mortal so now I'm confused
"ive a huge forehead" she's so cute
To me, this is BEFORE and BEFORE ( not after) You are an angel😇😍😍😍
She is cute AF
BEAUTIFUL girl
Perfect!
Ou Yaz
She is literally a queen
Notice she had makeup on when they started??
I would love to know which brushes she used.
Voilà 😍😍
Jeffree Star bought me here xo
The shade is not wrong. As you can see throughout the video it matches her more and more because the foundation oxidizes
more is more lol
Love her and her makeup look. So suttle yet so fabulous!
😭i live for rih rih OMG
She does not even need makeup...she's a natural beauty!
anybody else notice when she was like "it only takes me a long time when i...procrastinate" when she actually meant smoke?
I LOVE HER!!!! 😍
omg she's the cutest lol
Omg!!! Yeees!!
She is too funny and vibrant than most personalities. Thats RiRi!
4:31 lemme hold my angel
K, but what is a special nose?
shes so beautiful omg😍
Beautiful, I Love Her. More Then Uh, Yes Please. Slaying My Literal Life❤️
ADORABLE.
Yes
It's not 10 minutes when they speedup and cut the footage throughout the whole clip.
I'd say she's right craic on a night out
Ok but when is she releasing that orange/pink eyeshadow/blush duo??? I need it!
Just the colors are off everything else is perfect on her lol
I live for Rihanna
Fat who??
That foundation isnt her color tho😥.. She still looks great just 2 toned lol
.... The Simpsons... Bababababababababababababababbababa
That contour shade is too light for u
I think that Riri is one of the only celebrities that actually uses her beauty line products
Omg I love her 😂❤️
❤
i've never actually wanted to get into makeup until this!!!! riri you queen, you goddess you gave me life todayyyyy
The foundation shade tho🙄
i love her so much
Any idea on what that lip gloss is?! I need it in my life I havent seen it before & its not listed in the description
I hope she does more videos because she’s so refreshing. I think we can all agree that’s just the perfect word for her cause she’s so real and honest and she does things for her face and says don’t do it to your face unless it works for you and you like it. She’s just so refreshing!
Obv after contour and concealer it all blends it like obv she knows what she’s doing with her foundation guys she makes makeup lol chill
ah i love her personality.. beauty, fun, hot, love you riri
"No I look fat"
QUEEN RIRI✨😍
beauty gurus are out of a job
The foundation shade doesn’t even match😂😂
Love this.
“It only takes me long when im......procrastinating.”  I smoke when I do my make up too Rih ;)
💞💞💞💞
7:26
Our olive toned queen! 🤩💕

3 words : SOME FONDATIONS OXIDIZE
This made love Rihanna more. ( I didn’t even know this was possible) ❤️
The foundation is too light...

how much can i love her
She looks sooo different
and God created woman 🎈 girl I really love you ❤
She is really beautiful without make-up too. She is amazing
rihanna just single handedly ended beauty vloggers
What color foundation did Rihanna put on?? It's like the perfect match for her/our complexion and I need that in my life
I'm use to seeing bad girl ri ri, today I see an Angel!❤
So cute! Love you Rihanna! Thank you for the tutorial!
Her foundation is too yellow for her skin & concealer *does not hide* bags under eyes, it emphasizes them. She did not promote her line very positively as the results weren't especially flattering & I found her personality annoying. My opinion.
"testa se arrombar navio" kkkkk
I don't watch makeup videos but I had to watch this😍 thanks queen❤️🙏👑
like na fada
she needs a channel omg
We need more like this. Rihanna is good at doing tutorials I really love it she’s funny and amazing😍
She is soooo beautiful
she's so sweeeeet
Diva❤
Riri😍
What gorgeous lip gloss is that?
i love her so much. James Charles who?
She’s so thick
My beautiful queen
Thank you so much!!!! ♡
She is gorgeous 😍😘
she is so real!
This was like watching ASMR she as such a soothing voice😍😩
The highlighter was the bomb!! Lol
I ain't here for the makeup 😎I'm a guy I'm here to ask you will you marry me
..and you didn˙t show not even one of your product!! :-((
Lovley person💕💕
I never knew I needed this
epic
Sorry, Rihanna I do not like your personality at al...you are so full of yourself it is painful to watch. And your make up?! Not so great as you might think....
I love this I love you 😍😍😍
Notice how she didn’t show her bronzer? Hmmmm RiRi you got a lil somethin coming up on Fenty Beauty line?
Search 'red velvet dumb dumb' here on youtube you wont be disappointed 😊
Sunset,love,drama  BITCHES
She would actually be a really good YouTuber loool
Omg I just fell in love with her more ♥️✨ she’s so cute! And I love how much fun she made this video!
I love riri 😭❤️❤️
AMEN
Rihanna eres preciosa❤ todo un ángel :'3
She has more personality than other YouTube MUAs.
beaucoup d'aide
“Love, drama, BITCHES”
the foundation doesn't match her skin tone...
Riri looks so beautiful without makeup 😍
What's up with her foundation colour? It totally didn't match with her own skin colour, makes her look more gold or something
She's so pretty!!!!!!!! 😩😩😍
I love her
La cara muy naranja, ella es preciosa! ❤️
Her foundation is way darker then her neck ! She should have pulled it down a little what the he’ll 🤦‍♀️
my love ❤️❤️
Horrible
I just love her !!
Is that black henna on her arm or a tatoo?
Queen Goddess ,,,,,,,,
love heeeer! <3
Girl! You dont know how you r cute. AMAZING!
Elle a dit "voila"! Ptn j'étais tellement pas prête 😂😂
“more is more” -Rihanna 2k18
you forget the neck though
sass
I love how she says contour😂
Bajan precious you did perfect and fun!
The foundation is awful
Okay seriously how can someone be so perfect? I demand a beauty channel...
"VOILA" 😂😂😂 I'm french sister !
She doesn't even have to try
”no i look fat” bruh bye
shes so cute omg
Amo a esta mujer cada vez más 🙈
Excellent lol! I'm a dude's dude who NEVER looks at videos like this. Since Rihanna was doing it, I had to watch!
She wasn’t already wearing foundation??? 😱😍
The way that she pronounces contor😍😍
Really hoping you didn't show bronzer Bc it's one you're releasing soon 😭
I love her and this tutorial so much but i feel like the foundation is a little too warm-toned
She looks way better without the makeup imo.
She hasn t got make up, she s black
What was the lipgloss shade??
There is a huge color difference between the face and the neck. Am I the only one to clock that!?!? Face has a golden tone, neck is more reddish. Yes, it oxidized and improved a little after a bit... but the difference is still very obvious.
só vim assistir dps que vi a paródia
WIG
This video got me shook
I’m not even into makeup but it’s re re

Okay who else came just to hear her voice....?      And see her face? 😂 Like srsly getting ASMR vibes rn
revendedora de cosméticos e blogueira ❤️
I love how Rihanna is just so unapologetically herself and doesn't really care how she acts..love this so much <3
Why are people saying this is good? She blended horribly and her contour was ashy and not the right color, not to mention her foundation was orange. I love her, but I won't lie because I do.
Cute personality.
yasssss I love her so much she so gorgeous
Thank you Vogue!  YOu and BG Ri Ri made my Monday!
Perfection 😩😩😍😍😍💓💓
By the way, i love VOGUE

សដថថងងងងហហ
សដចខចវងហប

I can’t believe how relatable she is omg 😂💕
You're so beautiful with and without makeup ❤
5:40 GUYS
I’ve never followed Riri so didn’t know how she was I always thought she was tough and hard because of her music I guess but she’s so cute and funny!! And that voice 😍
Oh my god she's so CUTE!
I love Rihanna she's so bubbly :)
Es preciosa
Why is she looking like a light skinned Whitney Houston??? Is it just me that sees this..... I am not being anything I love Rihanna ❤️❤️
Loveee this 💜💙💜 sooo wana hang out with Rihanna omg I use to make my own glitter ✨ cream too with baby oil and eye makeup 😂🤦🏻‍♀️😂 and coconut butter sooo funny  @Rihanna
Such an attractive woman
Wish they showed what bronzer she used and the lip gloss.
She didn’t show what mascara she used :c
I love that lip color... any1 know the name plz
the fake scripted beginging to try to be real......
Rihanna is the most amazing sassy funny woman ever I am inspired i'm only 10
I don't do make up and I'm a guy lmao just watching because I love her personality 😭😭❤
''and if it doesn't fit in my purse, i'm changing my purse'' lmaoooo
omg i thought this was a girl who was gonna do a Rihanna inspired makeup look and i was like omg she look just like her. then i was like ooooooooo it is her
The way Rihanna says contour makes my whole life💎❤️❤️
Omg love you girl, amazing ...💜💜💜
Queen. Nuff said
Diva!
Can she just make a YouTube channel
At 10:10 you can see her nipples
what's the lip product that she used?
Omg, I want that orange and pink highlighter,  did anyone else notice those to pretty SUMMER...OMG...when are those coming out🤔🤔
Glad I’m not the only one who likes pink shadow. Next time somebody has something to say ima say: *Rihanna does it!*
She is so sexxxyyyy😍😍😍😍
有点像宁静
Tão linda ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m so in love 😍😩 Rihanna literally is so beautiful
"ya know...who I'm goin to see 😛😛😛😛"       HER NORMALITY IS SO SATISFYING 😂😂😂
she's so cute
I love me some Rih! BUT..... Come on now. Sis got a whole makeup line and her foundation still doesn't match her skin tone. I don't wanna hear all that oxidize crap, cause, it's orange on her. What is it oxidizing to? Dark orange? But still, she is gawgeous!
EU SOU UMA BAIANA
omggggg so beautiful​
I just love her personality, so fun! Go Riri:)
Love you riri!!
she is beauty. she is grace.
I cry. How freaking cute, I love her 😭😭
That is not her color
Lomfl
You look like a pateto omg🥔🥔
lmao was she high when filming this
You r sooooo funny and beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😘👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
her voice is so soothing
she is so cute
she does not need makeup. some celebrities really need it but Rihanna has naturally good skin
forehead only a mother can love
احبك ريهانا
omg she's adorable
I want to achieve that skin color 😍
Queeeeennnn
Eres perfecta en pocos días 6 MILLONES
Today i was really sick but dang My gawl Riri just made my day!
Rihanna knows she’s adorable as shit❤️☺️
What’s the lipgloss ??😍
no affence but u do have a big forehead but u still look amazing
She looks so good without makeup.
hi guys that part sooooo weird and funny i always hoped shed contat me at tlccoolkid1575@gmail.com
Pink eyeshadow looks nice on you
Uh. I hate her. She is so gorgeous. She shouldn't even wear make up. Too much goddessness.
look awesome but she choose wrong the foundation =D it oxidizes on her skin =/
LOL
She beautiful, off course! And her personality even more so ♡
Gorgeous but I just wish she showed the brands that weren’t hers. Kinda seems stuck up.
Summer... sunset... love... drama... BITCHES!!!
She's amazing. Don't think she has to worry about wearing makeup. She's beautiful without any.
Is that her real eye color or contacts?
Rihanna looks hella fine without makeup
Anyone know what she used for her inner conners like the gold stuff at 8:13????😍😍😍😍😍i really need😩
the way these girls talk in their heads... for a second don't think the scientists are not studying what the women wa...want to look like..
Rihanna's cupites bow is deeper than my future and that's a compliment
He looks like the average black chicks with wigs. I don’t see the hoopla. Black beauties like Lisa Bonnet, Her daughter Zoe, Jada Picket and , Megan Markle. Those are exquisitely gorgeous women!!
O pior parte é quando acaba 😍😍😍😍
Rihanna eu te venero
Eu to apaixonado por esse vídeo
I've never seen rihanna so close 😍😍😍😩😩
WWWWALLLAÁ!!!! ♥️
anyone who called Riri fat is insane...Like HOW
Nice look, but the foundation is too light and yellow for her gorgeous skin tone.
I feel like I’m now best friends with Rihana
There's no woman like her 💕
Does anyone know what she used for her inner corner?
this woman makes me melllllllllllllllltttt
This is actually the best makeup tutorial I have ever watched! A perfectly glamorous look that doesn't look too cray-cray, plus I love that she made it as easy to follow along as possible :) <3
The highlighter looks a-maaaazing!!!
Her smile was everything!!!
You guys should do Ariana Grande!
does anyone know which lip gloss she was using? Was it fenty?
Your face is yellow
SUNSET , LOVE , DRAMA ..BITCHESSS HAHAHAHAHAHAH
I don’t think she’s all that cute get person though
Me encanta, es perfecta <3
Go Rhi Rhi..SHINE LIKE A DIAMOND 💎💎💎❤❤👍👍👍👍👍👋👋👋👋

I wouldn't have guessed how insecure she is.
Everyone’s looking at her makeup and I can’t help look at her bathroom gurlllllll
Such a queen oml
Why You didn`t give her the right shade of foundation guys? I guess she doesn`t even use her own products.
It's been 4 days and she's still trending?!
2nd of May. I think   ¤    \<□<
pink on the lids... it says summer, sunset, love drama...BITCHES😂
Finally someone  honest who doesnt pretend that wears just mascara and blush when it's about going out make up.
Love it 😘
#teambigforehead ❤️
You are so beautiful and funny😻 love you so much
Que cabesa grande tenes rianna
I LOVEEEEEEEEE HER she is an icon.
HOT

the foundation is wak but she's a dream, she looked better without makeup
I LOVE YOU girl!!!😭😭😭
She is adorable.
Slay
I adore her so much ughhh
You are always cute dahling
The fact that Rihanna thinks she have a double chin makes me say F it ... ima eat this burger 🍔
this foundation matchs 100% not...
"I got double chin" me girl me!!
LOVE YOU  ❤💋💕❤
I love how she will only show us the product if its fenty
Rich as a beauty blogger yes please!
I love how shes says contour like cuntor 😂😍❤
Hands down the best one yet!
So dope !!!!!
what lipstick is she wearing? I cant find it on the fenty beauty website and neither the eye shadows.
So gorgeous!!!!
Oh nooo blend that foundation down your neck!! It's so orange.
She is so adorable!!! I love her giggle
Bruh rihanna is just a regualr chick like the rest of us, I mean she just cool humble. Not the she wasn't before but this just made her seem more laid back and like you getting ready with your homegirl or sister in the morning ygm.
her foundation is too yellow
Too perfect and sweet <3 GAHHH!!!!!
Yess Queen😍😍😍
i would die for you mother
the prettiest
omg she is the most beautiful
Rihanna is seriously one of the most hypnotizingly beautiful woman I have ever seen
beauty at its finest
I love her so fricken much
makyaja gerek yok bebek gibisin zaten riri
"I look kinda cute" - bish u rihanna, u basicly perfection okay
Which lipgloss?
I laughed throughout the whole video ..... "bad decisions" 😭lol
I love the way she says “contour” she’s so beautiful 😍😍😍
in euphoria with this video
I love the makeup and all, but it's kinda cheating when she has a flawless canvas 😍 Drop that skin care routine, sis!
Does anyone know which lip gloss is she using?
QUEEN
I love jour lips rihanna i love jou kiss
Is it weird that I'm a male watching a makeup video? 🤔
Ughhh so beautiful
How beautiful😍🤤😭💕
we goin to the clurrrb
She has a cute personality but she turned herself into an Oompa Loompa, and people talk about Trump being a Cheeto.
What is that lip gloss?????? I need it!!!!
Cutie.
I am 43 year old and I love your make up! I think I am too old for glitter and all that shine, but I can't resist this: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!
Rihanna manda um kit desse pra mim poder esquecer que sou horrorosa kkkkk vai que fico bonitinha. Kkk
WHY SHE IS SO FREAKING ADORABLE 😍👑👑
Hermosa
Лучший туториал эвер!
Update: Rihanna still can’t wink
I could never get bored watching this video    over and over
Update: Rihanna still can’t wink
Background music?
Her voice is so seductive
J’ai rien compris mais rien que de la voir parler ça me met de bonne humeur
Alguém de bom coração legenda esse vídeo, ainda não sou bilíngue 💜💙
5:51 💓
I miss thick riri
I love riri rihannaaaa eu teamooooooooo porra😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Her island accent has really gone away , you hear it slightly
Why is she such a queen? IM PREACHING HER
entertainment wise, she's despised for being a stripper more than a singer. but business wise, who she is more spotted now for, she is loveable for taking concern various women's beauty type of all skin tones instead of using own cosmetic label as a platform of self-centered.
I never thought I'd finish the entire vid, so fun to watch. She's so adorable!
when it's the third time you've watched this video & have no regrets.
mükemmelsin❤️
😍😍😍😍
A natural Beauty... love the look 💄💅
rihanna olmuşsun ama cildine uygun renk fondöten bulamamışsın
ريهانا تجننين 😍😍😍😍😍
Omg I wanna have her Baby 😆😆😂😘
I just want her to give a wet beauty blender a try just a little water just teeny tiny bit of water But it came out perfect
Yes yes yes queen
I love you..... Music💜
I simply LOVE her nail polish colour!!! Gorgeous shade of red!
People saying her foundation doesn't match her... it needs to be 2 tone lighter bec it oxidize and tones down. Flies away
Hide that double chin ... ohh lawdy   😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
All hail queen Riri
Queen. That’s all I have to say
I want the product at 5:32 but I cannot find it :(
its impossible to hate her.
The most beautiful woman there is 😘😘
she's so cute haha
可愛い🌈 💜 🌈
La perfección ❤
She is weird looking ...yes I said it
Anyone know what lipgloss that was please?
This video cleared my skin
is it even possible for someone to be this perfect?
I don't hear her accent as much
Love Rihanna <3
I never watch celebrities doing whatever they do, this is the first one and I LOVE IT, I loved her personality 💕😍✨ so real, no drama, or showing off PERFECT 👌
Skin color is incompatible with foundation color

лицо по сравнению с телом получилось рыжее ,как морковь)))
LOVE LOVE LOVE This video of how RiRi can be herself and show how simple applying makeup can be. My video will be up later on how I apply as well check it out!
I started watching this video as an alpha male, but now that the video has finally ended, I can gladly say I am part of the “other” gender category !!
She’s so beautiful but i feel like her foundation dont really fit her  Edit: hahaha why do i even have this many likes? well thanks i guess!

If dat how u look without make up....😘😘😘😘😘
Shes better without the make up. Ladies you dont need to cake on 5 pounds of make up.
She is just to cute😂💞💞💞
Make up is stupid..a litle lipstick..alright but this transformations..is too to much..i mean i would have you..just clean..no make up needed...make up is a girls obsesion
she's rihanna though. she looks great even if she's not on make up.
Rihanna just ended every beauty guru's career
why is she so beautiful in everything she does. Like wooowwww😍
Too cute omfg
I love this and i don’t even do makeup or none lmao

Amei sou sua fã
My queen!!! I love her everything about her. She is a GEM 💎💍👑
Rihanna İ Love youuuuuuuu uuuuuuu , the first famous  I know
nice makeup - said by natasha
the foundation looks like mustard
Rih looks a bit like gamora
But her face looks so orange after she applied the foundation. It's the wrong shade!
She needs make up! She is not ugly but that face is a lie. I feel like I’ve been cat-fished.
“Because I’m black you know that’s a very special nose” 😂❤️
The best make up tutorial i ever watched!!! You are the best Riri your personality is to love ❤️
I just realized thanks to this video that Rihanna should have a YouTubed channel,  which would be binge worthy cause of her personality...and then..she’d have a secondary channel just for ASMR 🌝🌚
That lip moment had me gagged
She's so funny!
Omg is that the new ones?
she is just...i dont even have the words to it...perfect than perfect
Step aside muas the real hbic is here

She has herpes
The cure
Kill me now. Just kill me. I don't deserve her.

This is the same lip she's been wearing for her recent appearances..she needs to drop that new Fenty now! lol

9:03 elle parle français 😲😍

Wow she is literally perfect and so genuine
Why do  I love her so much
icon
queen
My inspiration
She should’ve sang FLAWLESS instead of B
Anyone else get a low key Jeffrey Star vibe....
😁💗
I can't stand it when girls do their makeup and their face a different colour to their neck. She didn't use the right foundation i thought she would've darkened it out along the way but it finished with her looking like a head stuck on another body. I don't know maybe it looks different in life, well hopefully for her sake.
i loveeeeeeeee you Ri
“Everybody knows concealer is used to cover up bags and dark circles and hangovers and bad decisions. Over here is the cure.” Yesssss Rihana is soooooo amazing she doesn’t even need makeup
Kinda got teary eyed when she called herself fat :(
I freakin enjoyed it til the last count. She's so cute😍
oh my God😍😍😍 Rihana 😘😘she is a glorious...lovely
is it the lighting that makes her foundation look so orange??
Her smile is everything
I used to hate her, now I'm so fascinated by her. She made me smile throughout this video. Cant believe that I'm saying this but I love her! <3
I thought she had makeup when she didn't have makeup
4:38 i love her so much !!
I feel like this makeup look is for daytime more than a going out look in my opinion........
Even the queen herself thinks she looks fat
❤
Wish she had a YouTube channel just love her omfg 💖
she’s already gorgeous without it omg💕💕
she is so beautiful and sweet❤️love my sis
She's so beautiful  😍😲💃
i love rihanna
shes so cuteee
Para mí gusto es el mejor video de Vogue, así que BRAVO VOGUE BRAVÍSIMO
I cannot be the only one who thinks she looks like your 'average every day normal life' black girk without make - up. Don't get me wrong, her personality shines, and she is pretty, all round an amusing person. However, i can't help but feel that if she wasnt famous, her looks would be nothing special
She is amazing 😍😍😍
I just love Rihanna
Rihanna has no flaws. She’s extremely gorgeous with and without makeup and so down to earth.
Why are u so *ADORABLE*
What highlighter she uses?
She reminds me of Liza Koshy!
When she said « love, drama, BITCHES » i just cried 😂😂😭
She’s got so much personality and she’s confidently gorgeous ❤️😍 I can see why Drake put time on it *swoons* #looksarenteverythinggetyouapersonality
Rih a clown had me laughing the whole video I can’t take her seriously
What is the thing called that she put in the corner of her eyes for highlighter??? Someone help pls
RiRi 😘💕
she's so cute and funny XD
OMG shes GORG without makeup love you riri love you riiiiriiiii do you love me say yes say it 😩
"If it can't fit in my purse, I change my purse" Hahahaha, I thought I'm the only one 😆😆😆
Rihanna's epic 10-minute whatever equals being rich as f*** and have a professional do your makeup with airbrush every f****** day.
5:24 nose contour cause I'm black special nose. Lol. Rihanna u busy, but read at least 1 book this year, mine: After College When You Don't Have A Plan https://www.amazon.com/dp/0692086609
Why’s her foundation yellow though
Depend on... "who I'm going to see!" 😂😂 💚her
Beautiful just the foundation is too much of a yellow undertone for her hehe  She is hilarious!
Goddess rih rih 😍
Rihanna is a Gorgeous Queen with or without makeup
She doesn’t need makeup, she’s beautiful. ✨
*Q U E E N*
Imagine owning a brand that's famous for having exact specific shades for everyone and not wearing the correct foundation shade.
This was super cute <3
Just Stunning❤️ but that pink eyeshadow/blush is giving me Life😍
My mother, my queen, the goddess of music and makeup and unintentional ASMR,,,,
Specific products?
rihanna out her killing /all/ the other beauty gurus
She's losing her accent 😣
First time I see someone using their product without promoting them
I love you ❤️😘💕
👍💕😗☺🙄🖤💕♥️
Eres preciosa.
Unproblematic fave💗
pure fire
just being real but she honestly looks lokey Orange
Í would like to know what is the product she put on her shoulders and chest
Literally thought she had on makeup b4 she started putting on makeup
Okay but why is nobody pointing out her brows omg!  Either someone else did them or those were not done within the 10 minutes. Or well maybe they were I'm a lil suspicious since mine take forever lol.
i love her but girl her foundation doesnt match her skin
Is it all Fenty? ⭐️🙆🏽
So beautiful🧡
I’m screaming. I love her so much 😍😍😍. She is so beautiful 😍💕🤤😘.
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT LASHES YOU USE OR MASCARA!! CAUSE THEM EYES RIRI ARE EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW!!
It is sad to think that Rihanna thinks she's fat. She is a goddess and so many people agree. I guess even someone we idolize so has the same insecurities we do. Keep slaying bb girl.
Overly love her.
I love Rihanna's personality!! She is so funny and cool!
I fell in love again
Smash or pass ?
That's a LOT of makeup lol
So it’s not just the face make up but the body make up too?? Thank god im a guy.
When the video started I thought it was like the intro with the makeup ready, when she started applying it my jaw literally dropped I was like she was bare faced??? My gosh how beautiful she is!!!! And so natural and down to earth, I wish she had a YouTube channel. ☺️
If it ain’t Fenty Beauty, then we don’t see it on camera! Yaaassss! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
U look much better without makeup
Thas my bish I love you bishh
SHE IS SOOOOO CUUUTTTTEEE😭😭😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
She’s so funny and beautiful plus she looks genuinely happy
This woman is pure magic
NJXZC JII

"It's a brand new one" 😂😂😂😂

Call me weird or crazy but I planned to watch this because it’s her product and I wanted to see her apply it on herself. But because her voice is raspy and ASMR is “in the air,” I ended up falling asleep and starting it over. She’s such a cool person

1:22 at least she knows 😂😂 she so adorable but am I the only one that feels kind of shocked or it feels unreal that Rihanna is like talking? Like unscripted or planned out talking?
Everybody knows that concealers made for hiding bags and dark circles‘s and hangovers and bad decisions and for when Chris Brown punches you in the face and for highlightsssss

That's it. YouTube is over. Pack it up everyone Rihanna is now the only beauty YouTuber that matters
She’s adorable
Very natural and glowing look!
I love Riri so much
At the beginning She's such a cinnamon roll like omg!!!! So cute
Would love to meet her one day
She's not just a pretty face but is so funny. I love her so much
She is so beautiful and down to earth she is just overall amazing #rihannanavy

This made me super happy
she is so cute
Foundation wasn't even her color but still glam😍(but she did say she was sunburned that might have been the problem)
sooooo dam cute ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The foundation oxidized too match her skin tone. So it goes on bright then dries rapidly to match your tone. The foundation looks astonishing. Very good Riri. I just learned how to do make up the right way. #Fenty
She should have a YouTube channel
what highlight is she using??
I just adore Rih ❤️
What is the product she use for the shoulder?   glamorous queen
queeennnn
The best one everrr
I have to know what lip gloss/lipstick did u use plzzz tell
Most satisfied makeup video i'd been watch in  my entire life. I love her so so much.
Loved loved loved loved thissssss❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm sold!!! #fentybeauty
She is not just good at singing but also makeup
Concealer can be used to... "hide bad decisions" ... Rihanna is so funny and adorable. Great tutorial!
Did she use the fenty beauty highlighter or not??
she’s adorable 💗
She's so pretty and gorgeous and adorable<33
Her lenses! Does anyone know where can I get one like her?!!
i didn’t realize how much i loved her until now.
You give me life 😍😍😍
What lipgloss is she using ? :o
Love youuu
Any small youtubers would like to support each other?👀💛

What lipgloss is she using in this vid? I love it!
Her voice is so nice 🤤😍
Bruh I don't even wear makeup. I'm just here for my queen lol.  Plus watching someone put on makeup is weirdly satisfying... xD
“Let’s start with foundation.” YOU MEAN YOUR SKIN IS THAT BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT FOUNDATION??? 😭😭😭😍😍😍
Riri is cool as ever. Encore!! Love the final look. The layered highlights and eye shadows are G, plus here brows are on point. (this says 10 minutes but irl seems like 20-30 minutes).   2 things Foundation off and didn't blend all the way down to neck (if the foundation was right then this step isn't really necessary).
Tbh I thought Rihanna already had on lipstick until she actually put some on
What a glowing goddess
Rihanna is perfection 😍😍
I love like video
I love rihanna😍😍😍 she’s so pretty and I LOVE her voice!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
No primer?!?
Why are there so many jump cuts
I LOVE HER 😭😭😍😍😍
What did she use for the highlighter in her inner eyes?
pure legend. xx

She’s so beautiful 😍
Rihanna needs to start her own youtube channel fr fr im in love!!
I can now proudly say that Riri taught me how to contour and highlight! I've watched SO many different tutorials, but Riri's made it make sense!
You have been my fav music celebrity since i moved back to the usa 4 years ago

Queen 😍😍👑

An angel
She’s so perfect
That difference between her face and neck tho
Amo essa mulher. Muito Diva... s2
Instructions weren't clear enough, I  became a father and my wife is Demi Mawby.
Beauty guru's who?
Glad to know she actually knows how to do makeup. She has a makeup line and you can tell she’s actually passionate about it
“bad decisions” 😂
More beautiful WITHOUT makeup on
Yassssssss!!! Lovely presentation!!!
where can we buy the eyeshadow?
That foundation is not her skin color and that's a lot of foundation
A KWEEN
She looks like a diamond in the sky❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rihanna please create a YouTube channel!! I love this! 😍😍😍 she is so pretty!
Like OH MY GOD she gives me life 😭💖
I love her !!!!
RiRi slayed!!! Her personality matches her beauty 😊💖
She's so pretty she could've stopped at the foundation, concealer, and brows and she still woulda been killing the game
My Diva Rihanna The most amazing beautiful talented music Artist indeed ❤️🎧🎤📱💄🎶💋🌹😍📱
This isn't hate, but why doesn't her face match the colour of her neck?? Is it the lighting?
After the make up..the face still looks the same..porehead is still like flowerhorn fish.. contour and highlights failed
FORAHEAD RULES BBYYYYY 😎😎😎😎🍭🍭🍭🍭👑👑👑👑💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻
We all need to sign a petition for Rihanna to create her own YouTube channel! She is so naturally funny and relatable I need to see more of her!!!!!!!!
How can someone be so gorgeous ??!!!!
I've never realized how cool she is. Rihanna, you are AMAZING
UUGHHHHH I LIVE 😍😍😍✨✨✨✨✨

What is that lip gloss??? 😫
So those Fenty palettes though...🙂🤗... That lipgloss 🙂 do I see SavagexFenty in there as well
O
Is it just me or she looks different here
5:40 asdfvvhskd ❤
That lil tiny beauty blender she uses for her concealer sooo cute am dyinggg Rhi
If I did this makeup look I would look like I was going to an S Club 7 concert. If you know, you know. #RollOnBodyGlitter
I'm SLAYED. DED. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
*WHAT A BEAUTIFUL QUEEN* ❤❤❤👑
An angel 😩❤️✨
SO it definitely isn't fair that she started this video off looking like she was already wearing makeup. Talk about NATURAL. She doesn't even need to wear it but when she does, it only highlights instead of covering which is a bonus for her. I loved everything ab this video, down to how great she looks in pink and her "savage" necklace. Seriously, pink and red are her best colors. I also liked the body shimmer that she used. The only weird thing is...the makeup she used didn't match her neck...but she is still soooo beautiful. she's my style icon and she is just flawlessly gorgeous. Sadly I can't wear that much makeup cuz its too time consuming and complicated...wish I could (cuz i definitely needed it) and it also made me sad cuz I can't really hear her accent anymore :(
The best
MY BABYYYY
😍😍😍😍
She made me wanna do make up before going out every day and i'm a guy lol
The neckkkk! But whatever she looks amazing
The best Vogue video's is Rihannaa ❤
i love you riri
What happened to her accent
When you have to use your own products as much as you can..
She honestly doesn't need makeup 😍😍
So adorable. Start a channel pleaseeee
I love her so much!! 😍 You are so gorgeous
Summer.sunset.love.drama.BITCHES!!!
we love a cute queen
Omg she's such a cute bean! <3
.. i have a huge forehead.... LOL I love a selfaware queen...
Thin or thick, she will still be gorgeous. You do you, boo boo.
Rihanna is just 😍😍😍 this woman is amazing
but that color is not her skin tone! she needs the right match for her tone
Carribean beauty 😍😍✌

I thought she was already wearing makeup and then she started putting it on
What color contour does she use?
So much talking about "looking fat".
❤❤❤
That was so cute <3

I love the way she says contour
It's so *humanizing* to hear such a charismatic, utterly beautiful superstar speak of her insecurities :) (we all have them!)
Definitely need more of these. I'm obessed😍😍

It is so funny how all the celebs have to go through all the criticisms about alcohol and drugs ... I think about this lady her skin is Great!! and she's young too... In short there is know way this lady stays up all night drinking and partying.  If she did she would not look this good without makeup. #40pluscurves
She’s so beautiful and flawless that I literally thought she had makeup on in the beginning!!
YAAAASSSSSSS SHE WOULD BE AN AMAZING YOUTUBER

When i was about 5 i wrote a letter thinking that it was magically gonna send to Rihanna in the night. When i woke up it was gone and i was so happy and i screamed but it was obviously my mom/mum😂❤️
YouTube page telling women how to be a clown. Women want men to be honest about things but all you women appearances are compeletely fake. Real men don't date clowns.
I could watch Rihanna do her makeup all day long
You pridi endvitaut meychap

Favourite video on this entire platform, i love her so freaking much
is this my mom
This is why i love Rhianna cuz she ammits that she got a big forhead and so do I but im really sensitive when it comes to showing my forhead so ill try every way to hide it
You are beautiful just the way you are.
So cute
Does anybody know what shade concealer she's using.?
She’s honestly so down to earth and reall! I love Rihanna ❤️❤️❤️
all y’all beauty guru’s might as well stop right now cause RiRi just killed the game with this video 😂😂😂
This might have been the best thing I’ve ever seen. 😍
I’m really in love with her so much more now 😍
So everyone's just gonna ignore that her foundation is too dark for her face? There's an awkward orange tinge
This is life. Please make more Rhi Rhi ❤️
Huge forehead girls rock!
she needs to make a channel i swear i will watch it all the time
Golden lip gloss to match her golden personality <3 best video I've seen all day.
Can anyone breakdown the products?
fada lindaaaaa <3
Öyle güzel ki...
OMG that is soooo cute!!! Love!!!
Ah meu deus, que Linda 😍😍😍😍 te amooooooooooooo muito
Love her 👑👑👑

highkey salty this wasn't a 73 questions
So cute video!!!
8:42 that fire engine squawk of joy, i'm dead  XD
I really want to meet her 😫

At the end of the video she still has a color mismatch: yellow face and red body. OMG
hahaha ´´ my forehead is huge´´, but who cares? You are lovely and sexy,I love you!
so cute
Gorgeous
I can already see the 100s of videos with the title of “I try to follow a Rihanna makeup tutorial” 😂
A mulher mais linda do mundo ♡♡♡
So beautiful!! I’m deceased ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭
She’s so cute😍😍😍
and the contour looks ashy on her
There's no one else like her, absolute icon.
I love the shimmer 😍
she is unreal!!!!! i'm in love w her wow bye
How can one be just so perfect 😍😍😍
no I look fat?
rihanna shares things like these with us because she needs us to buy her stuff...otherwise she is very quiet about her personal life. She feels so irritated whenever someone asks her some personal questions..I don't like this about her
Well she is orange
« VOILÀ »✨😭
She's my queen and always gonna be my queen 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
какая она без макияжа красивая :)
I love this, so real😍
I have absolutely no interest in make-up whatsoever. But Rihanna is doing it so I'm intrigued
Rhianna is so cool!!! Love her!! YAS BEACH!
I don't like woman with make up. The beauty just looks fake and seems like a mask to hide insecurities If a woman is truly beauty she doesn't need all that
SLAY MY LIFE,USE MY FACE AS A BED
Barbie
Her eyes color is pretty
toujours aussi fabuleuse !!
Rihanna: Sunset, Love, Drama, Bxtches

Best 10 mins and 28 secs of my life 😩😍❤❤
Ahhhhh I love her lol I have to remind myself that’s she’s human sometimes
Really 🤔🤔 No wonder my hookups always looks alot different the next day.
Thank you Vogue's channel for this amazing super video. I LOVE IT! Rihanna so amazing here perfect make up artist!
I'm noticing her vanity mirrors are not aligned in the background. The contractor messed up, they are completely uneven.
what did she use for inner eye highlight?
she's unreal
Please let me know about lip gloss and body bronzer lotion information:)
forty shades and you cant get a match?

I love her
Love the lip gloss!!!!
Pero...no es la primera regla del maquillaje que tu cara combine con tu cuello? Aquí no pasó.... Nada más ví eso y no pude dejar de notarlo en toooodo el vídeo.
diogo parodias
Uumh ...Oky cool.. but she don't even know that.. if you started makeup then "first you tide your hair back" then you started all this thing's...😑
um I thought she was already wearing makeup already lol
This is the first time I've heard her speak.
QUEEN
This woman can do no wrong!
I love Rihanna. I liked her make-up secrets but I missed brow and lashes :(
I WAS NOT EXCPECTING THAT ADORABLE INTRO AAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHWWAAAAAA!!!!!
Which concealer did she use?
Robyn you are the best!!!
rainha da porra
good video rihanna i like one of Taylor swift, thanks
My role model is just perfect!!!
9:47 LiTeRaLLy so PiGmeTeD
😍😍😍Love it
We all know that this was not 10 minutes. Lol Even I take a long time doing a “Natural” look. 😩😂
Rihanna is such a sweaty at heart. Love her!
Love the fact that she’s so honest I love to contour when I gain weight ... the cutest thing ever !!!
ايلافيو ريحانا
I never knew knew much i loved her until now💜💜💜
My Girl ❤️
anyone knows what is the lipgloss she uses? :)
What a Queen
Ma quando non esce il bodylava che faccia fa? 😂
I love Rihanna so much, she’s gorgeous and hilarious 😂😂😂
find a more relatable queen, i DARE you
She's so authentic 👍😁💪❤
shes so pretttyyyy
You shine bright like a diamond. 💎❤❤❤
shes so cute
Hermosa!!! :*
Ela ficou com a cara amarela?
Keşke söylediklerinide anlasam gülüm🌹
what lipgloss was thaaattttt?
Well were she used to live
she's so bubbly and cute!
Step 1 : be Rihanna  Step 2 : go out Easy peasy!
Anyone knows what brand or code she's using the shimmer glittery thing on her inner corner?
I live near here
MY GIRL RIRI REALLY DID THAT
Jeez she is fun : )
Love her so much. Such a beautiful person inside and out
Hey riri
love her personality in this video. im deft inspired to try doing my own contouring 😊
You make it look so easy.
Where is the accent?
I wanna watch Rihanna do her makeup every day. ❤️❤️
Só vim por causa do Diogo paródias
The way she said "Boom!" reminded me of Lilly Singh (Superwoman)
She is so awesome! I wish I was half as self-aware in terms of beauty as she is. Doesn't matter what I put on my face, it all looks the same to me... resulting in me just not touching anything but liner and mascara because I could be 20 shades off in foundation and I would legit not be able to tell myself.
seni seviyorum
I love rihanna but she used the wrong foundation shade tbh
i just watched an angel for 10 minutes straight
don’t even do makeup but i watched this 5 times already 😍
Now this is realistic makeup application. A handful of products and a beautiful finish. Everyone else’s video has 20 different products and brushes  that you MUST have available to make the “look”.
When she said "I have a huge forehead."😂😂😂
Why is no one noticing the new products!?!?
I love how awkward she is talking to the camera
SHE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THIS WORLD! FOR SURE
I really wanted to like this, but the foundation color...
shes so cute. Thanks Rihanna
I’m just a guy passing by. Don’t know anything about makeup. So I’m just watching and listening to what she said. Apparently the way she talk is so soothing makes me sleep xD
I love her so much I would love to meet her in person
She didn’t put any foundation on her neck and it’s bothering me lmao
what was that🤤🤤
Is that her without makeup guuuurl ur skin is booomb u dont need makeup guuurlll ur natural beauty
What is the gloss that she used plz
As a man I've just wasted my 10 minutes on earth.
georgeous 😍
She is soo gorgeous!!
Girl you are pretty w your natural color and would love to have a lazy day w you looking the nat sipping on some ice cold drinks Chopin at the waters edge in an open hut
Love Rihanna!!!!!!
Love you my queen  👑❤️🇺🇸Rihanna 😍😍
Rihanna, we need to be friends.
she is so adorable ????
This tutorial was everything!! Love her
I love Rihanna!!!!
Best one ever! RiRi should have her own channel. Lol
Her vibe for summer is.. more is more... LOVE IT
lol yellow face
She is so cute "I look kinda cute" kinda ?  that melanin hunty...😍
She’s so beautiful even without makeup! ❤️
I Love Rihanna!!!!!!!!
she is prettier without makeup. what she applies on her face, foundation and countour, their colours is so fake and don't look pretty.
Omggggg, I actually love her
first of all, she is so freaking cute that I can't stand it.
BECAUSE AM BLACK..AND VERY SPECIAL NOSE....down
I Love you❤❤❤

My new favourite video
What is the makeup product she's holding @5:32 ??

Her accent gone?
No hate but, why should you use concealer to remove your dark circels and put brown eyeshadow under your eyes....that looks like dark circels...but at the end it was on fleek😱
I love you, Riri 😘😍
What is that at 5:21?
Riri😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

Never going to Stress again not matching foundation with my neck. She just set a new trend
She’s so cool 😭

You are absolutely positively gorgeous.

Rhianna is absolutely stunning ❤️😊
Rihanna looks like Gamora if she has no makeup OMG GHURL YOU DONT NEED MAKEUP  (ps if she's gon be mcu i hope she's related to gamora like woah)

She's so cute.
Rihanna might be a Goddess.
she's gorgeous but I think her foundation is too "yellow" for her skin tone

Hi guys, i just posted a new cover on my channel and id really appreciate it if any of you could go give it a listen: https://youtu.be/F5kx8YO0T8U Thank you so much!
She is so pretty and I'm in love with not only her color but also the way in which her body looks glowing every time. ... She's hot😍😍😍😍 I wanna look like her
Those eyes though 😍
QUEEN 🔥

She's glowing and she doesn't need any make-up
tell rih rih to open a ytb channel she gonna get like 2M followers in 1day lmao
Love this!
girl you are beautiful !!!
Okay queen
VOILA !! LOVE HER
LOVE HER PERSONALITY ❤️✨
I´m in love with her now..She´s so down to earth and charming!!!!!
if only she collared wit Patrick star☹️
Mom💓
Everybody knows concealers made for bags, dark circle, hangover, and bad decisions  I died😂😂😂
She def was born to perform
I've never worn makeup in my life, I'm a guy ... But I watched the whole thing for some reason... Eh that reason is Rihanna actually. She's funny AF 😩
The commentating is the best I’ve seen during a makeup tutorial😂❤️
she is so inspiring! love her
The honesty in this tutorial uplifts me. In my reality, I watch beginner tutorials (I’m learning) and they’re discouraging. I just want to look naturally beautiful.
She doesn’t need makeup 😍👌🏽
i think the question most african american women have in mind is probably what "bleaching cream" she uses.
Love it!
bitches
Rihanna so stunning. So down to earth. One of the most natural celebrities out here. Less is best 😝😘😘😘😘💋💋❤️❤️❤️ Keep winning!!!!
RIHANNA IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL!
Shes so adorable im crying?!?!
"i look fat" wow then im obese
Nice
Omfggggg so I wish Rihanna did beauty videos like this on the regular/had a beauty/fashion channel she’s so charismatic and funny
it says 10 minutes but loads of the video is it being sped up...
Is it normal to cry while watching this? She's 100/10
Cool
what a queen
i never noticed her forehead till now...why u gotta do this to me riri
Oh that shark tooth brush <3
Summer... sunset... love... drama... BITCHES
A versão brasileira é melhor! 😂😂😂😂
she is bein relatable jaha
Der Farbton von der Foundation ist grauenhaft 🤮 noch heller ging es nicht?
She’s so precious
*pump *pump *pump new bottle *continues pumping
she sounds like she's really having a good time doing her own makeup! that's cute!
I just love when her cute, little Barbadian accent comes out sometimes. 😍❤️
not to be dramatic but i would die for her
Rihanna don't listen to mainstream media in US you are beautiful and georgeous girl! Love your music!
Very nice and entertaining.
God
Love her ❤️❤️
Jaja 💙  Que linda
Omg I lovveee rihanna xx
Fave video on yt.
She's really a natural beauty and her makeup looks great, the only thing that I didnt really like about it is that this makeup makes her skin appear a bit yellow compared to her natural  skin color, or her neck at least. I feel like almost everyone I know  does this kind of yellow makeu, even though I pesonally dont get this trend.
She is so cute..
She a cutie 😩
Rihanna is so beautiful!!!😍😍
Love her..those colors are GORGEOUS on her.
Why you skip the eyebrows 😥 super gorgeous Riri😆😆😆
❤️❤️❤️
i love rihanna but "no i look fat" ???

what lip color and brand did she use?
I really love her so much❤️💯😍
seriosuly so simple but so glam !!! wth never have i seen a turotrial like this ! im shookkkkkkk
Cool
Speechless
What a L E G E N D
How can you not love her?!
She's so down to Earth and real, I'm here for this
What did she use at 3:57 ?
Wooooooow
Best tutorial ever
😍 GORGEOUS & FUNNY 😆
Who’s gonna tell riri her foundation is too yellow?
She NEEDS to have a YouTube channel with stuff like this!!!!! I'm actually so mad she didn't her brows being done. I LOVE how she says Contour &Hangover!!!!
Omg it's you 🦄🦄🦄🦄😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩so beautiful. Love you riri 😭😭😭
My mom named me after her I’m 11
No shade, I love her, but is she super loaded right now? LMFAO this is too too much!!
So pretty
Lmao she’s goofy
See she is beautiful without makeup--  but in my head I'm thinking she's not as cute because I've seen her makeup face (the one in the end i truly associate with Rihanna). But then I'm like--no that's not real beauty! It's what people try to make me think is beautiful. Makeup is tough for me to wrap my head around
5:47-5:53 😍
i’ve never seen rihanna like really express and show really how she is and omg i literally love her likes she’s like every female when it comes to makeup she’s so goofy i just love it❤️❤️❤️
When she say, “I’m going to do my makeup “. I’m looking at her like, you don’t already have foundation on??? Glowing skin!!!!
Awesome chic!!! Love her forever.....
Her personality is like the best ever 😂
Such a beauty ✨😍
Who else felt like u were their with her doing her makeup lol❤😁
I wanna know what lipgloss that was, I seriously need it
I can't believe I watched the whole 10 minute video.  Time flew by.
“More is more” mood !!👏🏽👏🏽💕😂love that
YAAASSS QUEEN
I would never understand makeup and never will and I don't even know why I'm on this video. 😆
She is exquisite... Pretty sure God was showing off His mad skills when he made Rihanna.
How can you not love her ❤️❤️❤️
she's so cute tbh
I can feel better about my makeup skills if even Rihanna can't match her foundation.
A queen
Video gave me life😍😍❤️ love you Rihanna. 😩
You did that Ms. R
Wowee I spy a new fenty highlighter that I rly rly need
i love the way she says contour
I love her !!!!
Her face is a totally different color than her neck :'(
She is so cute <3 I love her!
😍😍
Make up cant cover up that forehead
perfect skin, perfect face, perfect personality!!
Loving the weight gain!!! She is So Beautiful 😄
She is gorgeous ! 😍
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL
Riri pretty 😍😍😍😍
Her face needed a lot of make up wooaahh
First real tutorial on Vogue so far. All other super models have like 3 products and they are “done”. This is my reality, once i start its never ending process 😅
why is she so gorgeous 😍
When Riri created 40 shades of foundation yet she can't match her own. Maybe she forgot to create her own shade? Hahaha
can she be a youtuber cause it be fire
her make up look so real epic..so simple yet so lively.....
She didn't need makeup
It’s purple not pink😂💓💕
Cutie❤
I have a huge forehead
yo, anyone know what that brush she's using for powder is ???
Rihanna should make a new album
♥️♥️♥️
RIHANNA IS A QUEEEN SHES SO PERFECT OMLLL ♥️♥️♥️
She is so cute!
I love her personality! Feel like I'm getting ready to go out with a friend!
your foundation don't match your skin tone
A lot of DP, a lot of cigarettes? a lot of vodka/
I never noticed Rihanna and Azealia Banks kinda look similar
Why her?
I love you!!! I know you're busy but you should do more things to show your personality. Pleasseeese I'm dying. You're adorable Rihanna!!
Why is no one talking about the new highlighters and lipgloss? 😂😍👑💄
She has the best lips!  Wish mine looked like that.
I loved how she proved how orange Fenty is...
More life🤔🤧
Simply Beautiful
She's so beautiful 💜
she is so cute
Hold on that orange and pink what is that eyeshadow or highlight haven't seen that in her collection before.
juz love this fantastic woman ❤
WHAT IS THE GLOSS?! IS IT HER GLOSS BOMB?
Glitters compliment her skin so much SHE'S GLOWING
Concealer is for hiding decisions. Hahahhaha. I love her.
Ok I’m go buy some
If my mom doesn't love Rihanna, I'm changing her
But she have to drop that highlighter because I need it
I NEED That Lip Gloss!
anyone know which lipstick rihanna used in this video...
I love your music so much
This was the best make-up tutorial ever 😂😂😂😍😙😅👌💋
I love how to vocalizes her insecurities. It’s what makes her endearing.
how she said 'hi!' all loud and excited before shushing the person then saying 'hi' a lot softer and sweeter ? was so adorable ?
50 shades of foundation but still can’t match it to her skin yone
"Everybody knows that concealer's made for hiding bags and dark circles..... *and hangovers*.... *and bad decisions*....Over here, the cure"  _so fricking true girl_ ❤️😂😂
8:43 take off your headphones   Don’t make the same mistake I did
Rihanna you so cute 😘💄💋👌😅😍
WHY IS HER SKIN SO PERFECT AND CLEAR we need a skincare tutorial stattt
Rihanna have beautiful eyes!!!!!!!!!!!
Love you rihanna
RIHANNA MA QUEEN😂😍
Is it just me or her face looks way more yellow compared to her neck and chest? maybe was the lightening but ...idk she's still sooo soososos pretty
She is just freaking perfect.

I absolutely L O V E the way she says contour
left this video even more sexually confused than when i clicked on it
Goddess ✨
I love how Rihanna Pointed out all her "Imperfections" That ugly people with ugly envious hearts like to rag her on. She is gorgeous. Imperfections perfectly PLaced for a beautiful human like Rihanna! Love Her!
I'm going to do the warming on your hand trick with your product! thanks rih rih

rihanna needs her own yt channel tyvm
This was great!
rihanna at the first 20 seconds is me. ALWAYS.
LAME!!! A WORLD FULL OF DECEPTIONS!!!! SO SAD FOR THE SHEEPLES!!!!! Oh! Gotta go!! It's time to do a research on ROBOTOIDS!!!
LOL! queen riri showing the girls how a VETERAN DOES IT!!!!
I lived for Rihanna's look
Girl got about 50 shades in her makeup line and uses the most yellow one that does not match. And for everyone saying it matches at the end you are wrong. It doesn't. Shes definitely beautiful though and the application looked amazing.
This was amazing!!!!!!
she is so funny she makes you laugh and she is beautiful too .. and she does a great makeup tutorial!!!! love her!
Did Rihanna just snatched my wig
Good job 👍🏼 girl new subscriber

i never realized how cute her teeth are until this video, aww ♥️♥️

NO MY QUEEN YOURE NOT FAT
her skin color is beautiful and  very neutral, why is she using  a yellow base foundaition ?
Fenty sales just went up!!! Love this girl!!
Ok Riri.... do you have an accent or not!?
this is what it would look like if Rihanna had her own Youtube channel-- and did makeup tutorials. :o
the only thing I can say she needs to improve on is matching the tone of her foundation to her skin- that was too yellow :/  but she looks gorgeous <3
This video made my week
Eres tan perfecta dios mioooooo riri 👑 👑 👑 👑
Sunset. Summer. Love. Drama. BITCHES

The foundation looks really yellow compared to her skin.
Gorgeous! I love this look and love Rihanna’s charisma. She is doing her thing!
Carli Bybel and Rihanna have the same voice!!
So gorgeous!
MY QUEEEEEEEN
She's the one that I can talk with all day long.
Well there’s no way it took her 10 minutes to do her makeup this time bc with all the edits and cuts was still more than 10 minutes lol.
A queeeeeen
I wish my face looked as good as her does :(
The GRWM to end them all
"Because it says summer... sunset... love... drama... BITCHES" Lmfaoo 😂😂

I miss her so much :( need another album
LOVE THIS! and loved it even more because it was a women of color!!!!
Little known fact that Rihanna is not her real name.  She was Maria until the age ten when kids would bully her and call her Maria Diarrhea so her aunt changed it.
Love this!
I LOVE RIRI
She is more than gorgeous.
She’s so entertaining.
I love her 😍
Even if She did again weight she Must have Gianed it in all the right places BECAUSE I CAN NOT TELL 😍😍❤️
i always liked Rihanna but this video made me fall in love with her! she's so sweet!   she also gave a lot of great pointers in this video, especially for someone who is just starting to get into makeup!  THANKS GIRL!
Vim pelo @diogoparodias kkkk
What lip gloss is she wearing?
She has such naturally beautiful bone structure......  But I hate her nose being that contoured
I think I'm in love
My queen
This tutorial felt so natural to watch, like she was posting it on her channel like a makeup guru, until.....the clapping at the end -_-
CAN SHE START A MAKEUP YOUTUBE CHANNEL
I love Rihanna, she is so true to herself and so real
Someone hook me up with the lipstick she's got on!
This is the best version of rihanna 😃💕💕💕💖
The face+The personality+the accent= MY FUTURE WIFE
An absolute queen!! 😍
Anyone know what the product she used on the inner corner of her eyes was?
She doesn't even need it, but she's beautiful either way
Sexiest woman alive!
Entendi nada mas assisti até o final

She's so dope! I just want to be her friend. 💋
I actually think this was a good tutorial especially her explanation about contouring.  Can't wait for those new products!!!
all this time I thought her lips were done! she has such a gorgeous natural lip color
Her lips are beautiful!
Ok how many ...of you guys are gonna recreate Rhiannas Makeup for summer?! I know I am 😍😘🤩 freaking Gorgeous Ugh 😶 speechless
lil orange but so cute
I'm sorry guys but I don't think she has a great personality. She's just trying to be normal but the fans' obsession has her in this weird fog. She's honestly still going through culture shock.
"We going to the cluuurrrrbbbbb"
My dream wife
SHE IS EVERYTHING!!!!! LOVE HER❤️
She’s loving it!! I love her
She’s one of those celebrities that actually ACT HUMAN😂 I love herr
I am dark-skinned, like her. But why do I have a feeling that I will NOT look as good as her with all the shimmer and highlight and bright colors? In fact, I will not look good at all.
😍😘😍😘😍😘😍😘
who’s prettier??? and sweeter?? idk
"First, I'm gonna put on 9 pounds of foundation to cover my gigantic forehead..."
HELP i can't stop watching it 💕
She’s so down to earth I love it
CAN YOU PLEASE PUT THE NAME & SHADE OF EVERYTHING SHE USED IN THE DESCRIPTION? Like I thought that was a given....
OMG Beauty!!!
Rihanna I am learning more about make up! thank you and you look sensational!
My sis Riri is the real deal! X
Very sad to remember someone thought it was a good idea to punch this woman on the face.
Talk about perfection ❤️
Gorgeous !!!!
Where's her accent??
Love her but that foundation is way too yellowy for her
she is soooooo cute 😭😭😗😗
All other makeup tutorial-ists just lost their job by this goddess ♛♛👏👏
I love Rihanna soooo muchhhh ❤️❤️❤️
Rihanna needs a channel!!!!!!
Love my cousin ❤️
She's so cute lol
I now officially love her
Watched all 10 mins+28 secs of the video and still lookin' 4 that "Double chin" sis was talkin' bout🙄🙄🙄#BitchWhere🤔🤔🤔
What about for when you're ugly?
THIS IS NOT HATE! RIHANNA IS MY QUEEN AND ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL BUT... does anyone think her foundation looked a little too yellow? like the undertone was off? she has a really pink undertone and the foundation undertone seems really yellow,
Drake low key saw this and said daaaaaauuuummm
Eu amooo essa molherrr jesus
I soooo LOVE her!
GD Rhi I know the pnt of this wasn't just to show skills but idk maybe show fans your flaws evn tho I didn't see really any sorry u do it's natural but leave out the self hatred ...the beauty of makeup is to + to your God given beauty accentuating the best feat's & HIDING THE NOT SO PERFECT ONES sooo idk stfu abt "altering ur wide nose and double chin...not all ppl have 1 bc they're fat & you're Dominican a Hispanic Island African hybrid so blame ur insecurity abt a wider set nose on YOU not being black I knw just as many Hispanics with wide noses & you said big so I'm being nice bc I love your music and you but I ain't into the self hate esp whn you did something amazing giving all colors a place in the makeup industry but its 1 step fwd 2 steps bck...not this black queen honey ✌❤
Oh my God she’s so funny 😂😂😂
ewlk dafuq
I love the way she says bitches
Love her
SHE'S PRETTY WITHOUT IT! GIIIRRRRRL I AM JEALOUS FR
Rihanna is trash. as is Anna 's thinking the blob of desperately necessary makeup, fake hair and fat rolls that make a Rihanna is relevant in fashion or beauty.
You go girl! You look marvelous darling as usual!
legit best tutorial ive seen on youtube now
I am Rihanna's NUMBER ONE fan! Love her a BILLION TIMES ;)

Omg can’t wait for this collection !
She did not use the proper shade of foundation... She looks more beautiful without makeup.

I love this young lady and she doesn't even know me, LOL.
so pretty😍😍
What’s colors and products did she use ?
She was so fun! I loved this video! Is the body lava her product? Must get some!
What am I doing here! ? lol
Far too yellow for her.
What a baby boo😍 I love you the sun you shine and go beyond all remains as glittering and remain humble as you are😙💥💛💫🌞
I enjoyed that! Go riri!
I would just like to hear a loop of her saying "con-tour" in different contexts
YESSSSSSSSSS QUEEN !!!!!!
this is my new makeup routine
this was life changing
I luv her😍
she' s as charming as she is gorgeous! Can we be friends?!?
Hi SWEETHEART!....
Live her so much💟💟💟
Is anyone else wondering what lashes she used... RihRih 😭
SHES SO CUTE
Claims Fenty matches everyone's skin colour...
Loved this
I really really really really love her
Does anyone know if the highliter duo she used (pink n other shade ) is aveliable to buy anywhere? Thanks x
This is my favorite one. This is the ONLY one that matters 😤
She is so funny and beautifull 😂😍
what's the body shimmer she's using?
"no i look fat"
i think the foundation shade doesn't match the rest of her body, it's a little too yellow. other than that, Rihanna featured in Vogue is better than all the other makeup tutorials on YT! 100%
much love
Contor😂💗
She is so beautiful!! 👸👸
You're perfect!!!
Yesss so Comfortable to watch
F*cking GORGEOUS!!!!!! :o
God I love her. She’s so beautiful and fun. Jesus, please let me be friends with her!
I need NEW MUSIC !!
she is so stunning!
I feel like Rihanna been in Disney Channel but that’s China Anne McLain 😅
RI SO CUTE AHHHH
I will never use makeup, and am I guy and watched this whole thing. Something about girls applying makeup is so soothing. Now waiting for them is another story :/
👤💭👤💭👤💭👤💭 *RIHANNA* is very _BEAUTIFUL._ *_"BEACH PLEASE"_* 😄
TBH SHE LOOK PRETTY AF WITH OR WITH OUT MAKEUP YOU GO GIRRRL.
You're gorgeous with make-up, you're gorgeous without make-up  When are you never gorgeous!!!!
The beauty gurus are quaking!

How high was she when she did this? haha
What’s that lip gloss?!
I Love you riri
That foundation is way too gold for skin tone. Still beautiful tho, I mean it is Rihanna
Why would she even need make up, I wonder
Hang overs and bad decisions means she got coked out the night before
So beautiful
😍😍😍😍
Rihanna: 7:00 Me: smiling back   She's sooo beautiful 😍❤
Yes i just watched that and im not ashamed lol makeup is so cool
Rihanna I love the new 'fuller' figure! LOVE IT!
Freaking Gourgeous and sweet/fun
we love a fenty beauty queen
beauty guru's are SHOOK
Her smile is sooo cute and beautiful, it makes you smile just by looking at it
She seems very personable in the video. However, the foundation seemed slightly off to me. Hmmm.
i love this.. don't worry i got the beach joke lol
Good lord why makeup? she looks good even before applying makeup so jealous >:(
So cute ... What a beutiful neck too
MY GIRL STAYS LOOKING LIKE FIRE
I love her sky color

I’m Rihanna at 8:45 whenever I put on any of the Fenty Beauty highlighters
<3
That foundation was the wrong shade, but loved the video 🙂
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS JUSTTT PERFECTION😍😍😍😍
Rihanna you could've just asked nicely for my wig
When she first applied the eyebrow my wig got snatched so hard
this was better than an entire therapy session
♥
Rih just taught me how to apply makeup in 10 minutes better than this other MUA on YouTube. Thanks Rih!
Could someone tell me what lipstick she used?
She and I are the same complexion...I'm buying this
BEAUTIFULLLLL RIRI
This was very personable. ❤️❤️❤️
It looks gorgeous but the foundation doesn’t look like a perfect match for her :(
My queen 👑

なんだろ、リアーナの実況がかわいくて何回も見に来ちゃう😇💕
Glad you made this makeup vid ReeRee.... Thanks and much love .

She’s so sweet 💕
She is so perfect
I feel you girl I have a huge forehead too..gotta cover that thang up a lil bit
Maybe the foundation is too light for you, but you look perfect.
What lipstick is that
That foundation colour is totally wrong for her
Can someone tell me why she gave up on herself and sooo fat these days? lol still beautiful tho 😍
Sweet and beautiful girl.
I just love her hajaha she is the best
When She Stares At The Camera Her Eyes Just Feel Like Their Piecing My Soul 😩❤️ She’s So Beautiful
So cuuuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Talented, charming, hilarious, and Entertaining! Love your vibe and superhuman heart and beauty <3
She is a queen
I think it is adorable the way she talks, she is one of the most beautiful people inside and out,  watching her made me handle my weight gain a bit easier, I realized I am beautiful just the way I am. We are all beautiful.
Or Going out without surgery. This is unrealistic. Dont fall for media and pressure.
The Queen..
She seems so sweet I never looked into her personally but this video let her personality come thru thank u vogue
💗💗💗💗💗
I love her! Yesss RIRI 😍😍💗💗💗
Black girls are 🤢
She doesn't know if we can take it 🎼🎼🎼
Rihanna is the actual cutest person alive ! 😍
awww I love RiRi
Very beautiful girl, really like me))
Oml!! I just love her so much! She’s such an amazing person!!❤️😩
❤️❤️❤️❤️
A beautiful goddess Riri
Rihana😍😍
Omg where is her accent!!!!!!
Girl so you just skipped doing eyebrows!!! Really sis? Not cool
Flawless
I've been watching makeup tutorials since 2013 and this one is probably the best one I've watched.
I need that concealer for all my bad decisions
LOVE YOU RIRI! ❤️
YASSS RIRI ! Love you girl! <3
Completely wrong foundation shade gurl! But love you <3
Who didn't like😒. The nerve
she makes my day, awwwww riri wanna see u one day, keep slaying queen
i love you rihanna..that's all
Her accent is so beautiful
I literally dropped my phone when she used her highlighter 😩 sissss it was soooooo bomb! I wish she’d make tutorials. I loved this!!!
I kind of do the same steps but it takes at least 30 minutes lol😂😂😂
im very happy with this video 🙂
HER LAUGH> EVERYTHING ELSE
The first makeup video I didn’t skip
man I just love riri.
Fuckin queen 😋😋😋
I have no idea why anyone think she's pretty or beautiful...  She looks like a regular person to me.  Sorry...I like the underdog..not the those girls who every says "Is pretty or so so so so beauuuuutiful"
mom.
absolutely adore her !!
Your natural lip colour is the prettiest! 😍😍
Can you do a video of sing lesson for people who want to be you and I look up to you and I'm 10
She makes me embrace my forehead 💕💕
I adore Rihanna , but as a make up artist I can see she is having fun here. Every edit, her make up artist has got in there and corrected whatever she was doing with that make up . The end result shows nothing she actually  did to herself ......thank God
I love your bathroom
We are waiting songs for you!
She’s adorable
Going Back to the store to buy EVERYTHING Fenty ! Love you Rihanna😙
What a queeeeen
Who knows the name of her lipstick??!! Is GORGEOUSSSSS, A NEED.
Awww so cute💓💓😘😘
every other mua? Jobless after seeing this video
la amooooo!
I would have chosen another color for the base foundation. It gets better with the contour and concealer and body glow but its still mismatched and way too much foundation but because of the dark complexion she gets away with it because her skin is drinking it. A beautiful and powerful young woman she is. I could listen to that voice all day long <3
Can someone please tell me all the products she used? *picks up credit card*
I love her 😍
I love her💕💕💕
That lip gloss tho 😍😍😍
this changed my life
Rihanna's so real
no hate but it's funny how she didn't show the products that weren't fenty. like r u that beg u can't even give credit to other brands
I just wanted to hear her voice for 10 minutes. I'm going to marry this woman one day.
Super beautiful!!!!!!
HAHAHAHAH LOVE YOU FRVR RIHANNA 😭❤️
Slay Queen
Voilà
Omg she’s so adorable
Literal QUEEN
WHAT LIPGLOSS IS SHE WEARING!!!! I NEED.. NOW!
shes so pretty
My baaaabe!!!! 😎
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Where has this been all my life!?!? 😩😭 she is such a captivating soul! And ima need some of that body lava liiiiike right now haha
She could be a beauty guru soon
Invented makeup tutorials
I like her forehead😚
Yes gal be great ! You look good you look blessed!
I love that she does a natural look. She's not super beat. She still looks like herself! Other girls come out looking like factor made bratz dolls. They erase all their uniqueness..
I love her 💖
Yaasss more of rihanna
Rainha do mundo te amo
0 flaws
These made me love her so much more.....just like a regular girl
She looks runway ready 😘😘😘😘😍😍😍
beautiful  rihanna
IM TIRED OF NOT BEING HER WIFE IM DONE

Can she actually start a Youtube channel!!!!!!
Okay,she is really beautiful
Charisma queen👸
did Rihanna just say she looks...    *"fat'*
Beauty
Love her!
Rihanna the queen💕💕
Is it weird that I am a straight man, and I actually enjoyed watching a makeup video on YouTube? I mean, I don’t care for the makeup.. but Rihanna’s personality makes it entertaining enough and she’s just too gorgeous, It’s hypnotic...
loved this
I watched this so many times and I will probably continue to watch this video. I LOVE her!!! Her makeup line is so AMAZING!
So now her face has a different colour than the rest of her body... ok...
God I wish I had $ for make up, but first I wish I knew how to put make up on
ugh shes so cute and flawless!
this why I love her so much
Lolll she goofy asl and her makeup was so pretty
Ready for the date jeje! Just let me know when i pick u up ! Bless!
what a legend
She's very rich yet very relatable to a girl like me which is a very rare thing to find in these instagram/Kardashian/Jenner days. I see alot myself in her.
Gurl I like Rihanna but that foundation color does not match boo
Okay but the lipgloss... I need it. Is it part of her makeup brand?
I understood like 20% of the video but doesn’t really matter 😄😍
She should do her own podcast or show!
I wish the video listed the products she used! Like what is that lipgloss!
Love Rihanna😘❤
Her personality is unique just like her ❤️❤️❤️💪🏾😍😍😍
Love her personality...the foundation shade is not very matched.
Loved her eyeshadow, it was nice to see a bit of her personality. She was bubbly cute and sweet. How could Chris Brown hurt an h a beautiful fun loving girl?? Creep. Never mind.
She has such a beautiful personality and I really just wish that we were friends💖😘
Please do another one!!! 🙏🏼
“Hide that double chin..”   mE
We gonna need that brow video gurl, 🧐💞
Beautiful Legend❤️
I've been seeing this everywhere... so here I am. bless.
Rihanna , my best friend 😍😍😍😍😍❤❤

Um do you all not know the foundation warms up to your skin tone and hers matched perfectly but let me guess.....obviously you all are not true makeup artists lol other YouTubers have mentioned it as well. Love you riri ❤️❤️
😂😂😍😍😍💖💖💙💙
I need all of this makeup !!
At first I was like girl.... that foundation is not working. Then I was like wait no its Rihanna, it always works
OMG Loooooooove her
Nicely done. I'm glad she didn't go overboard with the makeup. The Bozo look is so unnecessary. Lol!
rih you gave me so much lifeeeeeeee i love youuuuu
Quem veio por causa do vídeo do Douglas Paródia?! Br
she's funny "who I'm gonna see" .... girl bye lol
she's funny "who I'm gonna see" .... girl bye lol

RIRI talking bout her forehead. I’m done.
SHE NEEDS A YOUTUBE CHANNEL!!! QUEEN!!
Well some of you say the makeup is too light. Remember what she said in this video “makeup is fun so play with it” basically if you want to be darker than your normal skin complexion do it, if you want lighter do it . Have fun with makeup 💄 it’s not that serious. ReRe you did a great job and it was fun watching you. Love always. And 2 the woman who said she don’t listened to your music 🎶 I suggested she starts cuz she will love all your songs. ❤️
She’s so cute omg
when is she dropping this summer collection i need
is she the owner of this brand ( voque) ?  Btw i have acrush on her

Plastic surgery selling face cream. Girls that wear make up and perfumes do it because they stink and they're ugly. Don't clown up like this clown.

A queen 😭😭❤️😍

This video just gave me life! Such a gorgeous woman!

Perfect Make Up! Rihanna Queen Power!♥ Make up...♥
I’m so in love with her
I have never really noticed her forhead being "big".
cant imagine her with absolutely no make up...........lol
Her foundation though... it is kind of too light for her skin tone. You can see the difference between her face and her neck...
Low key need some body lava now 🙂
Buying everything....
They should make spray paint cans for women.
She's EVERYTHING aaahhhhhh 😍😍😍😍✨✨✨✨
Tão rainha! ♥️🇧🇷

So relatable "no i look fat" "i have a double chin" i love her 😂
Rihanna is the beauty guru the world needs.
she didn't blend it into her neck.. as someone who does makeup this hurt my soul
WRONG SKIN TONE ON THE FACE!!! COME ON GURL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Her Cupid’s bow is perfection.
she's actually so perfect
Omg that pink is so pretty! I need it now
Awe, too sweet. Love Her.
Alguém por favor, LEGENDA ESSA POHA
Shes so cute
wow i can't believe rihanna invented makeup
I would make my own glowy body makeup too lol
Omg instant tingles when she softly speaks close to the camera
herr eyeee colour thooo 😍😍😍
All That concealer she just wasted on her hand 😩
So nobody’s gonna mention that the foundation is not her shade?.?? Like i love her but she is not light yellow.
Everbody knows concealers made for hiding bags and dark circles, hangover, bad decisions 😆
What is that lip color?!
Cute ❤️❤️❤️
Ive never heard that neck contour triangle trick! def trying that
Mi Riri hermosa 😍😍😍😍😍
shes so cuuuute
The love of my life , thank you Rihanna
But what bronzer was she using???
She's so cute
tá aparecendo a robo sophia com peruca,melhor youtuber que vc respeita!
Is anyone else scrolling through the comments during the video to make sure no one had the stupidity to leave a bad comment
She is very funny , I love you Rihanna.
Beach Please!
4:40 she's so cute 😄😄😄
Were's this new fenty at I'm looking
this makes me feel high lol
Shine bright like a diamond! 😻😻😻
Queen!!!!
anjo
I love how she says 'Contour' 😁
She beautiful
M A R A V I L H O S A
Was she using new highlight shades?
❤❤❤
So where is our product list like we know it's all FENTY but what colors are we looking at
I love riri but that is not her shade 😩
She is a literal goddess, most beautiful woman ever I can’t handle
I LOVE HER
Even i clapped at the end-----shes peeerferct  😄😄😄👏👏👏😘 💕 😍
so adorable
How could anyone not love Rihanna like seriously 😂💕
Rihanna’s eyes are so beautiful ❤️❤️
I thought she had a heavy accent. Crazy
Wow I feel like her accent is wayyy less prominent.
Rihanna needs to create a youtube channel, like, right now 😣
she’s so beautiful 😍
So what are your plans for today?  me: Watching the Queen of highlighters applying her Highlighter then rewatch this video until I sleep
What is the name of the eyeliner shimmer thing she used om her eye
Wow she wears no eyeliners no lip liners no mascara no primer and no finishing sprays 🙊 ooooh
I'm very much in distress. The foundation didn't match your neck. The contour looked hella muddy. I couldn't unwatch your bottom teeth it looked like you had strawberry seed stuck. Girl stick to your proffesional makeup artist this is not for you. Nonetheless I still think you're funny.
Her foundation is way too yellow but she’s so beautiful
Adore this !!!
she is perfection <3
This is the best vid I've watched in days!!! Life changer!

This helped me more than any other makeup tutorial I’ve ever watched LMAO.
Vim por causa do Diogo paródias

Rhianna is so pretty without makeup
Lol I️m a guy and if Rihanna made yt I️ would watch
While everyone is praising her.....Am I the only one who thinks she did/applied her makeup bad?
Not gonna lie Rihanna’s music makes herself portray as boss with that never smiles just fights but finally seeing her talk which I’m so happy I’m no longer hesitant in liking her. I’m happy and finally I live for her
I used to be obsessed with her hand tatt, STILL AM😍😍❤️
For some reason Rihanna up close makes me think of Tip in this video. Lol Gratuity Tucci. Anyone else?
I love her even more
eyebroww tutoriall please😍😍😍😍
PLEASE GET CAMILA CABELLO TO DO THIS!!!!
Can she do more of these please lol 😂 😍
Okay she needs an ASMR channel 😍😍
She’s beautiful with or without, but man is she breathtaking with no makeup. She still glows 😍
I loveeeeee it
Just love her
Isn’t this too much makeup
This made me love her even more 😍😍😍
She is perfect ❤
Everybody knows concealer’s made for hiding bags and dark circles and hangovverrrrrs and bad decisions.....
Wow😍 she look sooo beautiful💛😍😍
Lol she is soooo effing funny!! I swear to God if she was ‘normal’ she would fit right in to my  friend circle lol
I don’t even where make up but I just watch this whole thing. Lol. Love her personality and voice (all soothing and ish).
This is the closest I can get to rihanna 😍😍😍😍
She has 40 different foundation shades and her shade doesn’t match her skin what tf?
Te amo rihanna divaaaaaaaaa.sou sua fã número 1 linda...de morrer...😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
BeACh PlEeze!!!
Man she’s so pretty
Ummm...Rihanna doesn't need even a lick of make up.
she is so adorable
She's so gorgeous and ironic at the same darn time
riri yassss
That makeup will not stay for very many hrs..but when u travel with a makeup artist (that definitely must use better products)..who cares. Her technique sucks and she was not being serious. Also her  lips were already done in a way????...cuz they are a lil fake obvi. I like to see this, though, because it proves to the more insecure millennials  that even wealthy ppl are not better looking or better in any way than the average civilian.
Her skin is glowing.
algum BR que viu o vídeo com paródia e ta rindo muito?kkkkk
I could watch this on loop
This gave me ASMR yes
Not trynna hate cuz I love my queen Rihanna but that foundation is not really her shade
😭😭😭 SHES SO HUMBLE
💓💓💓
girl you have your own primer which you forgot to use :(
OKAY WHAT GLOSS IS THIS
God has spoken. And she needs her own personal youtube channel ASAP. She is too amazing, tbh.
Lets not say “epic”
Drake missed out lol
She’s so cuteee
She outdid all these beauty gurus and I’m living for it. She’s just on another level!
Forever in awe of her beauty.
HER ACCENT 😍😍😍😍
FWI girl. Watch ur video again. Ur foundation DOES NOT match ur skin.
Love..drama..bITCHES

Pq tão linda, RiRi!!??  Eu amo a autenticidade  e personalidade desse anjo chamado Rihanna. 💎 I love Rihanna 💘

Love Love Loveee
She is the cutest thing ever ❤ love her she needs her own makeup channel I would never bored while watching her..

BREAKING NEWS: Sunburned Rihanna confuses entire comment section, but still slays all the haters. Story tonight at 9! 😂😂
Lipgloss people?
So cute
"No, I look fat"  first of all, no. Second of all would that be a problem? Is that something wrong?

She started with already makeup on.. Then she added another layer over it.  She didn't start by washing face because she is afraid she will lose fans if she removes makeup
What an amazing woman.
I thought this was a great tutorial but was this not her shade??
I need a rihanna makeup channel

Otra youtuber frustrada??? Sad😞

Why she is soooo cute
I didn’t realize how funny and silly Rihanna is. I love it 😍
She is so cute and precious. I love her personality how it’s so cheerful and fun
Please make a 73 questions with Rihanna or BEYONCÉ PLZ   Like this comment so they can see it and (hopefully) do it!!!!!😜😂😜😂
The contour color is too muddy for her foundation color
She's adorable
She is so much fun😍
Rihanna so adorable, I love her!
I never knew how much I loved Rihanna until now lmao ♥
Yes just yes only tutorial I’ll ever need
What is that lip gloss? Pleaseeeeee
She’s so real
I love it
her smiling cured my depression
💖💖💖
Do I see new Fenty Beauty? 👀💞
Come through Rihanna yasssssss 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 yesssss the contour will snatch the face at all times hunty!!!! Giving it to the girls hunty ❤️🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
So funny
omg i love her
love how she's so open & makes u feel that she's just like every other girl (which is a fact, but it is kinda special how she does it) Much love, Riri
Voilaaa juste trop belle so beautifuuuuuul
Anyone knows the name of lip gloss she used? I really wanna get one. plus she is so stunning!
Real Riri!
That forhead doe. 😍💕
All these other YouTube MUA’s are SHOOK!! Riri ended their careers 😂😂😂😂
OMG RIHANNA!! Stop snatching my wigs off plz! 😍😍😍😍
When everyone is falling in love with Rih over this tutorial but you been Navy so you're just sitting there looking like that "Oprah spreading her hands" meme.
She's amazing and looks beautiful but that foundation aint right
😍😍😍 I love her so much that is bae
sooo cute, makes me love her more :)
love the eye look
Her forehead consumed half of the foundation
We have been blessed
Rihanna actually looks like she wears her own makeup line. But you know girls can't have just 1 of everything so I'm sure she also had other brands and that's ok.
more rihanna please!!!!! shes so cute❤❤
Wow. I loved this! 😍😍♥️♥️😍
Who are the people in the background?
Rihanna bile yüzünün renk tonuyla boynunun renk tonunu aynı ayarlayamadiysa her kız bu hatayı yapabilir
This broad is so phony it's insulting. Cringe. I can't continue watching this. That big forehead is too aggravating for me.
Kind of cute .!! Really !!! You are the most beautiful women 😍😍😍😍😍😍
my new fav rihanna video or maybe fav vid on youtube  as a whole
" because I'm black that's a very special nose"LOL😂😂😂
Her natural beauty is better.
I've been waiting for this tutorial since forever.
Anyone else notice how much Rihanna looks like Zoe Saldana?
she’s so real and A BIG MOOD😂💕💕💕
shes so cute
"Oh no I look fat" "Gotta get rid of my double chin" "I learned to contour when I gained weight"  For someone who claims to endorse inclusivity (if that is a word) there sure is some negativity surrounding fat people 😂
Am I the only person in this world that wears makeup like even a glamour look but doesn't wear concealer?  Don't judge me 😫
I want to be her friend hahahahaha ❤️❤️
Omg i love her
Bad gurl riri so pretty😚
I love her so much lol
❤❤❤❤❤
Gorgeous!!😍😍😋😋
Türk yok mu Türk
I dont do make up dnt follow any makeup artist but she is just so natural she should just post a monthly video of her doing some make up and i would watch it.
i don’t even wear makeup but she’s making me want to start 😩❤️
Lol she's so cute
But... the foundation is yellow
OMG i love you riri❤
Beautiful as usual, Rihanna! ❤️
I want to be rihanna lol
Omg i lover her so much
La amoooo
喜欢这种正能量的feel～
she looks so high hahaha i love her
How is she even real? 😭😭
非常可爱的女生👍
How to look like Rihanna: Step 1: Be Rihanna
She’s beautiful no need for the makeup 😍
Beach please ‼️😂❤️
Most cutest person ive ever seen ... never seen her talk this much😙
Rihanna look like her breath stink...
Honnneyyyyyyyy YASSSSSSSS 😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Some1 needs to tell her that's the wrong foundation shade for her...
Her personality is so bubbly. She needs a channel. 😍
I love you Rihanna you are the best singer ever👏👍
Loved it. So relaxing
MY QUEEN!!!!
Omg!!!!! RiRi!!!!
I've never been a big Rihanna fan but daaam she is cute and soo gorgeous 💖💖💖😱😱😱🌈🌈
Her hair tho💖💖💖💕
I adore Rihanna so much. She's so precious.
Rihanna honestly the real mvp
She is so adorable😍
Rih😩💖😘😍
The moment when she said ;"VOILA" !! my heart is blessed <3
“Oh my god guys I’m Black you know very special nose “ 😂😂😂♥️♥️this is the most I’ve seen Rihanna talk she must be fun to hang out with
Her bathroom is gorgeous
I swear we are best friends!!!!
ADORE ADORE YOU. So BEAUTIFUL without any makeup. Love your tutorial. Wish I could hear the products.  Xxxxooooooo
i always wondered why foundation is always made so yellow... It ends up looking good after bronzer and blush and stuff but a lot of people have very pink or red skin like rihanna and the yellow i guess is meant to cancel it out? but then sometimes that makes their face mismatch their body
QUEEN IDK Y BUT I LOVE YOUR VOICE
We can all relate to this
QUEEEEEEEEN
I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in make up and yet I loved this video. She sounds very nice her voice is very soothing. It's the first time I hear her speak so much and idk I like her. Plus very effective ad for fenty beauty that's how it's done.
❤️❤️😭😭😭😭 she is sooo cuuuute !! I love her
👌🙏😊
6:59 rihanna is the cutest
Why do I all of a sudden love her even more
Her natural lip color is just INSANE  ♥
I literally love her 😭
Riri😍😍
I love Rihanna she is one of the realest celebs out there 🧡
I thought she used wrong foundation but it all about blending. Beautiful makeup and beautiful woman :)
If you wanna contour you can it's fine but just know that it's fine you gained weight at least your not a skinny little stick men like thick woman! Just know that you don't need contour your beautiful. ❤❤
And the result is that you are Yellow like a Simpson... wow....    -.-'
I only stand ONE queen
Baaaabbbyyy❤️❤️❤️
fabulous makeup vid i soo love d lipstick😁
yall!! Help ya girl out. What lipgloss is that that she was using?? I definitely need it in my life
What gloss is that?
I wish I knew how to apply my own makeup 😞 everytime I do it, I look 20 yrs older than I am.
she is such a gorgeous human being
SHE'S PRECIOUS
If you ever use the fenty foundation you know it dries down to the true color. So when you first put it on it looks lighter. That being said her foundation does match.
I thoroughly enjoyed this. Uh, I forgot how funny she is.   Also, did only use her Fenti makeup?
Best Tutorial I've seen on here.. She nailed it 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Aw this is so cute
"more is more"  yaaa girl go for it
YEEEES SLAY💕💕
Girl What double chin? Girl you must be blind. Cause I see no double chin
Bir sarkida patlataydin bea

Makeup is a mood & a vibe 💄 Rihanna is so gorgeous 😍
Lmfaoo i love her 😍😫
You are not “fat” your literally Beautiful
alright we love a queen, but every time she squirts out makeup or “warms up” concealer, she uses up more then i would even use on my face.
She is an absolute beauty
I love her ！ So cute！
A QUEEN👸🏾❤️👸🏾❤️👸🏾
I love her so much!
The way she says contour, I love it
kontür asla dağılmıyo çok kötü memnun kalmadım
I want her as my best friend
I love how she’s using her own products! 💗
I didn't know someone can be this beautiful
파데가 겁나 노랗네여 리한나씨ㅎ;;;; 피부는 좀 핑크빛이 있는거같운데..

Rihanna- *breathes* Me- “OMG WHAT A QUEEN.”

What’s the name of that body polish stuff that she put on her shoulder at the very end
This video of Rihanna made me love her 10 times more..
I wish I could pull off having a big forehead like she does:D
Should do more  #246 🇧🇧that was fun to watch.
too bad she can't take 25,000 dollars of her millions and buy some plastic surgery on that Herman Munster forehead, money can't buy everything.
Please make one with Deepika Padukone
fave part 4:40 lmao
is that new makeup i see? new drops coming soon?
It's so weird because when you see a celeb anywhere they act like...idk a celeb I guess? And here the queen is acting like a normal person. It's so strange but super comforting.
She need a Youtube Channel right now
Queen

She’s stunning I swear 😍💖😍
She looks the freak gawd. She don’t even need no makeup artist
Thks for the tutorial!  So convincing!! Loved it
I loved that and I think she is gorgeous...but why did she use such a light foundation? Obviously she was not trying to be white but it didn't really match the rest of her "lightly burnt coffee" skin as I call it
“Summer, sunset, love, drama, BITCHES” 😂😂😂
She doesn’t even need foundation, amazing skin ❤️
I had to check to see if i liked this twice.
She’s so beautiful and so tropical. 🌺
So she havent got makeup et the beggining ?
I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!
Rihanna is beautiful without make up
She looks good with that natural glow polished up well
U are a pro and beautiful with or without  makeup
the way she says 'contour' though lol
It’s a hard 30, mileage.

I am in love with her
Her lips..... they are unbelieveable

Ooooh wow every body should use this u know😘😘😘
What is the blush and bronzer palette called?

Maaaan  her personality is lit
Rihanna is the definition of beautifull.
I LOVE HEERR!!😭😍😍

She said the signature word: BOOM!!
How can she be the most popular person on this planet and still talk to me like she is my roommate?? Im in love
She is gorgeous with or without makeup
Rihanna can I hang with you for ONE DAY😓😪😪
"Where are we going tonight"? Haha somewhere where they are blasting your music until three in the morning. Riri provides the soundtrack for my nights out. You betta!!!
She’s pretty with or without makeup!!
Te amo!!!
Thank God you have enough money to pay for a make-up artist because girl, this was a hot mess.
She’s a princess
Bonita 😍😍
She said 'and now lips' and I thought she had already done them cause they were already perfect
i really like the lipstick but i think the foundation is a bit orange-y for her skin and there's a visible difference between her face and the rest of the visible skin
Türk var mı türk??? +1
Bad Girl Ri Ri is just too stunning with or without makeup 😔😍😍
i love her wow
I love u so so much my all 🌹 🌹 🌹
Im crying even im a man
I loooooove how she says “contour” 😍🙏🏻😩
riri you re amazing
I could watch her daily. LIVING FOR RIHANNA GRWMs 😣😣😍😍😍
LOVE her personality. 😂❤️
That voice tho
❤️❤️❤️❤️
When I choose a foundation, I usually start with a raft or mat foundation for shallow levels, and drilled shafts for deep foundations. I only used reinforced floor slabs and pour concrete to 140mm.
After this I really wanna go clubbing with her!
I love her so much omg
*I can't believe he's already 30!!!!*
You're so gorgeoussssss
Is it just me or is this film ASMR 🙏🏻
Reihanna is so beautiful! I would love to see a Lana Del Rey makeup tutorial. ❤️
Rihanna is bae
When she applied the highlight i was dead
she’s the cutest!!
i love her so much JESUS
I love RiRi, she has such a girl next door personally.  Love the whole Fenti makeup line.
I love the way she pronounces the word contour, it sounds very elegant.  This video made me want to run downstairs to my bathroom and play with my makeup.  Good job Rihanna ;)
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCERkqXIluBmDTAeDgo9v3Fg ❤️😃
f i looked like her i would NOT wear make up she's so cuutee
Yaaasssss riri she is so beautiful with and with out makeup omggg queen😍❤️🔥
I love this video. I never watch anything of Rihanna's but a good lot of her songs are really great so I just saw this video and thought I would stop by and check it out. I love watching her out in make up. She is not as show-offy as I would imagine. Then again I dont know her but she is really funny and such a nice girl .. please get a nice guy Rihanna.. you are stunning.
"summer, sunset love, drama... BITCHES" wow what an icon
Riri ❤️
i would sooo watch Rihanna if she had a channel even if she posted once a year!😢💖💕🙌
I love this woman so much.
rihanna asmr edition replay button: 10:03 10:03 10:03 10:03
She is so real!
I really just want to be best friends with Rihanna. She seems like someone really awesome to be around.
i cant wait for her to save the met gala this year omg
OMG YOU'RE GORGEOUS I LOOOOOVVVEEEEEEEEE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
I'm so glad I watched this. She is beautiful
Ten years ago I listened Umbrella by her and she looked beauty like today. Amazing!
Rihanna is Perfection😩❤️
WE STAN!
Beautiful!  But she skipped right past those lashes!  Girl how'd you do those?! lol <3
Well done!  Wow she was blunt about her flaws (which really isn't) which made you more comfortable and made you forget that she is a celebrity and not one of your girl friends.  I just bought into the Fenty makeup because a friend recommended I should try it.  They were out of my shade 360, so the lady gave me some out of the tester to try.  It took what was close to a month for the liquid makeup to come in but the sample made me pretty darn impress and determine to wait for it and I got the lip gloss.  I am 56 and so surprise how this makeup was on my skin (I have not been a makeup wearer most the time but being in the sun the skin is worst for wear.  I really think I am seeing my skin improve with each application.  I would have bought some other things in her line but at this age not sure how I would apply contours and body glow, etc.  I will take her advise and play with the make up.  Thanks Vogue/Rihanna
I love her so much
products?
So relatable
RI RI BABY!!! 😍💓 I’m finna cry just because of how beautiful she is 😍😍😍
Today is my bday and all I want is Rihanna to give me a call she gorgeous can someone that knows her relay that to her.

There might have been a tiny little itty bitty piece of my heart (maybe, impossibly) not totally in love with Rihanna- BEFORE THIS VIDEO!!!  I'm ALL IN NOW, beatches!!!😁😁😁
"Sunset, love, drama...... BITCHES"
This video is WILD like I'm watching it all "wow Rihanna is like a person who is real who does makeup" but also like I feel like I'm unworthy of this you know idk I can't explain but still,,

We need a '73 questions with Rihanna' vogue episode
I never realized I had a woman crush on Rihanna until this video 😍
This is how tutorials should be like “Naturally” no too dramatic like some of these ladies 🙄🙄
She is TOO adorable in this video!
👍🏻
I wonder if she moisturized and primed her face beforehand?
Rihanna are so beautiful
ThAt foundation is not her color...she looks orange
the color of her foundation is a little bit wrong tho :D

I absolutely love the makeup tutorial!!!💕 I’m just sad we didn’t see how the eyebrows get done I feel like nowadays YouTube just skips through them still beautiful as always though she killed it
You are such a queen omg!!! I love this video and you💓 so amazing
Whats the lip gloss? I need it in my life!
Who doesn’t love her 😭😭😍😍😍😍
Queen !!

Why doesn't she have her own channel thoooo??
She does makeup tutorials better that other YouTubers 😩❤️
I love you Queen such a cutie 😍😂🔥❤️
YASSS QWEEEEEN
*10*  *minutes* ? More like 20-30  Its speed up, and cut multiple times 🙄😂
RAINHAAAAAA
Look she is pink undertone but I don't know why she used yellow shade makeup I think she has no idea about Royal makeup its really sad
This gave me the urge to do make up
Is she in Barbados? I can see the AC in the background
I love that she is losing her mind at her own products... that is giving me life
She needs to do like her own YouTube Channel , where she will do some make up tutorials ... Love her so much !!!! Rih you're so gorgeous
Does she use her own makeup cause I bet she only uses high end luxury 😂
Bad gal
“hide that double chin” GIRL WHERE
Love sooooooooo much

RiRI is so beautiful without and with makeup. And her personality is to die for. She is funny and she can laugh at and with herself. She is one of kind celebrity. I love this video. You killed it RIRI.
Ri Ri you need a YT page ASAP
She is so... mesmerising
What she used on her eyebrows? 🤯
Make up for Big forehead bitches

I adore her at such a molecular level! Her personality is amaze! MUA’s on youtube need to watch out, lmao! She killed it. 😍👌🏻 Also, sidenote; she needs to stop being so critical about her gaining weight, she still looks amazing! Thin or curvy, she is gorgeous, PERIOD. She also looks so happy & healthy, and not disgustingly Hollywood thin!
She don’t even need to put on makeup, she’s already naturally beautiful 💕
She lowkey came for all the beauty gurus who made dupes for her body lava 😂...I was waiting for this ahhhhh 🤗❤️

Lindo maquillaje pero olvidó su cuello, simplemente debió unificar el tono de rostro y cuello para que fuera perfecto

okay so I absolutely love her don't get me wrong but why is she using fat as an insult in the beginning? i mean most people do but isn't fentyxsavage about body positivity? so I don't get why looking fat is a bad thing all of a sudden. not trying to be mean she's awesome. maybe I got something wrong idk I'm not a native speaker
Talk about PERSONALITY!
Loving her look
Love you robin💖
yasssssssssssss Riri in the house
Rihanna, you should do more of these makeup tutorials!! You actually make them interesting and fun to watch. And you're nice to look at lol

What concealer is she using?
That was amazing ... none of us deserve this
Vim aqui só pra lembrar de como é a voz dela mesmo.
Chris brown beats her up and she still runs back to him
10 minutes in video life or in real life?
I need that tiny brush that she uses to set her powder?? Does anybody know?
Love  Miss the accent though
I WILL FORGIVE BUT I ALSO WILL FORGET THEM.
how can someone be so cute?
"No i look fat" 😂😂
Lmao @ "No I look fat"
Queen! ✨
I Love this
Omg she is so beautiful it’s unreal
I didn't even look at the title. Saw her adorable face then clicked it right away
Anyone know what lipgloss she used?????
Every make-up guru youtuber is quaking right now
I hate that she calls herself fat. I think she's just gotten thicker. That's all. Still  beautiful...
“I’m going to start with the pink on the lids because it says, ‘summer, sunset, love, drama, BITCHES.’” 🤣
Love ❤️

“ I look kinda cute “ Hello?? You’re gorgeous !!
Fenty tutorials a concept
I am restored after seeing this
Is it me or is her foundation too yellow?
Iconic 🌌🎆
BAEEEEEEEEE 😭💔💔💔❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wonder how many times Rhett's seen this 😂
Que mulher linda meu Deus 😍
I only watched this because I'm suicidal and I knew it would make things worse. And it did.
I feel like she’d give great advice
OMFG 😍 my scalp is snatched!
Voice is mixture of white girl, black girl, Barbados girl. Lol tf . she's free in her mind lol
Super cute!
Girl u are bae 💜🔥 U look stunning as always  ❤️❤️ And adorable and cute  😘😘😘 Rihanna is everything  🧡🧡💖🧡🧡
Is she wearing a wig
How can someone be that perfect? honestly, I don’t get it. Rihanna is by far the most beautiful person in this world.

I just realised that she has a big forehead.. I have a five head and feel really uncomfortable with it, that's why I have bangs. But Rihanna is so beautiful and amazing and her forehead doesn't mind her at all. She's slaying!

2K dislikes 😳 REALLY!
Omaigosh she is glorious
Flawless az, she could have put on some lip gloss and been DONE!  She's so freeking  adorable ❤️😍
She is so breathtakingly beautiful that it is physically painful. If I could look like anyone on the planet it would be Rihanna.  Can I please be Rihanna for an hour?  So insane to watch the one person I find to have a truly perfect face thinking she has a double chin and big forehead.😂😍  Loved this so much!
Do you love me
How much blood have you drank this year RiRi.
Looks very exaggerated like all americans makeup but it's actually very easy and pretty. Love it 💗 Ans she's very beautiful
I think what it’s really attractive about Riri is her confidence 👏🏾
😍😍
ICONIC ICONIC
What was that product she used in her body? Body lava?
So Riri when are you gonna bless us by releasing that unrecognizable Fenty eyeshadow palette you're using?
she is so beautiful
this video could be 24hours long & I’ll gladly sit here & watch each minute of it😍
i need to see more youtube videos of her doing makeup and talking to the camera
but her foundation doesn’t match her body
love everythingggg abouttttt herrrrr
This is amazing
U should do more of these😉
When you don't have a double chin but you hide it anyway :D
I love you rihanna, thank you.
H E R M O S A 💚🌿💥💦
I love the way she says contour
Love her!!!!! She's so my fave...
Voila😂
Is she even real?
Someone has been watching too much bretman rock make up tutorial
Are we not gonna tell her the foundation is the wrong color.
You are such a wonderful woman Rihanna!
LOVEEEEEE HER SOUL 💗

I didn't even noticed she have a huge forehead until she mentioned it. People if you don't want others to see/notice your flaws dont mention it because you are ur own critic. We see the smallest things that people do not notice.

" I Have A Huge Forehead "  Hunny You Look Just Fine With It! ❤🤞
This was so satisfying to watch shes gorgeous. And the fact that she's doing her OWN makeup not like other people with brands who just have the brands and cant even blend their own shadow ya know ? ;)  love riri!
This woman is an ICON
I legit thought she had makeup on at the beginning to the video lmao. Shes fuckin pretty
is it just me or did her accent get watered down a bit than it was 10 years ago? she sounds almost american now. or did she water it down for the interview?
Seriously the more u women put on make up the more it fucks up and cracks your skin
The best I have ever seenn
So cute 😍😍😍
Big ups my Island Goddess!
YES! ... just... YES!!
I love it how she began a little quiet, but as the video progressed she became more open and spunky. A truw QUEEN 😍😍

It was nice to see her like this
Most beautiful woman in the entire world <3
I love you so much❤️
isnt her foundation too yellow?
Golden goddess
QUEEN
rihanna putting on makeup gets more views than rihanna music video in a day lmao i hate how she chose a wrong foundation shade
my Queen
SHE IS PERFECT IM CRYYYY
She’s sooo cute!!
"Pink.... because it says Summer, Sunset, Love, Drama and BITCHES."
New relatable to RI RI. Loved it
This foundation colour is odd...
The coolest personality I've seen in a while unlike other famous people who are going around like they we're born to be dope😭😭💕
I love her
She's so much fun!  I laughed when she said she learnt how to contour when she gained weight :D
i love her
She seems dope but I'm here wondering where's the accent 🤔
Snatched 🔥
Color is so unnatural
i have never related to something more than the first 10 seconds i am dead
SHES QUEEN 😭❤️
OMG i love her
I could watch her videos all day long, she's so beautiful <3
This was definitely one of the best 10:28 seconds of my life. This was very much needed
10:04 it's glorious because you are!!! 😍
Who else didn't want this video to end?
Rihanna looks like she smells really good
Why the thumbs down .. Y'all just 😒😒
Waaay too orange foundation and the concealer is too light for the foundation too. And why do people like their nails to look like claws? Natural is the best , this looks trashy. I'd rather see people that are actually good at doing make up, than hyped up celebrities.
That's ma girl
What screws me up a bit is that Rihanna, a woman who has a make-up line with supposedly loads of shades, is literally wearing the total wrong shade for her skin here. Is that because Fenty doesn't have HER shade? Because that is wrong, and that's why i don't wear foundation. 40 shades, by a light to medium-shade, pink undertoned brown person, and they can't even figure her shade out right, ridiculous. Unless she for some reason thinks that she has a yellow undertone when she clearly does not, that would show that she had nothing to do with the make-up line besides adding her name to it.
See that? AHHHH 😅
Ri RI is haliriously adorable
You are everything riri!
Beautiful sis!!
I lover her forehead!!
She is the best. Rih you go girl😍😍😍❤💥
We needed this
why's the foundation so yellow on her tho?
Please, do more. I want a 24hour channel of Rihanna doing her makeup.
bad decisions XDDDDD
Oh my God, you're a Goddess... I can't even... Thank you for your tips!
Most beautiful woman in the world. And personality to match
She looks like gamora more than gamora looks like herself
Honestly, you can't not fall in love with her after seeing just 30secs of this video ❤
omg one day 4 million .... relax people 😲

I just love her so muchh 😩😩😩😩
She is so uwu 😍

I LIVE FOR THIS
I swear Rihanna gives me so much life 👌💎💎💎
I wish she was a everyday YouTuber personality is on point , but it’s also crazy how she highlighter some of her insecurities and we think she’s absolutely gorgeous. Even tho our words shouldn’t define her , she is a beautiful person with a beautiful body and face xx

Amei beijinhos
this was the best vogue makeup video !!
My new fav video on the internet
i legit thought she was wearing makeup in the beginning, but turns out she just even more stunning than i thought she was.
We rarely see this side of her. So glad she can show it to all the fans and viewers. Rihanna is indeed beautiful in and out!!
Lovely
QUEEN RIRI 🔥🔥🔥
what lip gloss is she wearing?
You did an amazing job :)
I prefer to call it a "Rude" chin.
"I'm gonna start with the pink on the lids, because it says summer... sunset... love... drama... BITCHES!"  lmao 😂😂😂
แม่น่าร้ากกกกก
What an Amazing tuto with an Amazing woman
Is this the best makeup tutorial ever or?
Bad Decisions (Chris Brown)
Queen queen queen no one can beat her she's so amazing
i love how she isn‘t ashamed of gaining a little weight or admitting that she has a big forehead. what a personality
9:08 next eight seconds of life haha soo good, love love love her.
RiRi you're a** is so funny ♥ ;)
9:30 <3
People whinge about her but at least shes "REAL"
this got 3M views in 22 hours the power of Rihanna
With brows she looks like a completely different person
IM ALL FOR RIHANNA MUA
She is so adorable. Oh my God!  :)
I like riri
i am thinking riri and her skin is already beautiful she doesn't need that make up
Be auti fullll!!!😍😍😍😍😘😘😘
I love her
Oh my,  I just realised how much Superwoman ( Lily Singh) acts like her!
She's really not blending down her neck??????????
I’m a guy and I watched this whole because it’s Rihanna obviously lol but I want to comment how this is so amazing for women. She literally pointed out a few of what she would call her “flaws” and not only talks about them but owns them, with a confidence. I know so many women are gonna be uplifted by this video. Great for all of you.
She got thicc!
MUAs are shakin, RiRi is taking over, move over.
Queen ''No, I look fat'' AHAHAHAH <3
Glad she has chosen to be a singer 'cause she's very bad with make up....starting with the color of the foundation, the only good thing seams to be her eyebrows :). Love her as singer thought
Her skin is flawless!
She's actually the cutest I had no idea she was so goofy! I love it!
G O R G E O U S
I adore you and your gorgeous personality Rihanna!
She looks like bald
She on sum'in
I though the foundation is too yellowish but it turns out perfectly. I LOVE YOU RIHANNA!!
Lol i love her!
I want more tutorials with her!!!! I love this!!!
Wow she has a air conditioner at her bathroom cool
ı̈̈l̈̈l̈̈l̈̈l̈̈σ̈̈ν̈̈e ӵ̈σ̈̈ч

She has a huge forehead.
Is that only me or this video was soo satisfying😩❤, her voice was soo relaxing😭❤❤
She has such a cute personality <3 God I love her <3
Umm I don’t get the people that are saying she used the wrong color. How does one who founded the foundation brand she’s using even make a trivial mistake like that? Y’all need to stop reaching. We didn’t even deserve this video but she did it anyway. Y’all just shut up and enjoy the tutorial. 🙄
THIS IS THE BEST MAKE UP TUTORIAL THAT VOGUE HAS EVER RELEASED. Thank you Vogueeee! I've been waiting for this for aaaages.
Luv u girl😜✌
I love her so much
wy yu show your body to world .not shame.see jesus mother marya covered her head and body.

The only celebrity out there I think I’d fangirl over so hard if I ever get to meet. RiRi my queen 👑❤️
she's the most beautiful women on earth!

Her low voice sounds a bit like Mariah Carey!
8:56 beautifuuull ❤❤😍

She's so goofy and funny omg unlike how most people view her as badass and stuff💙💙💙
Wait....I wanted to see how you do your brows. Or is it a secret?
Actually in love with her 💖💖💖
Queen!!!
Is it me or her foundation shade doesn't fit to her skin color?
Honestly seeing her being so real and how she acts makes me so confident In myself and just makes me genuinely happy:)
Está tipa es demasiado real quiero puro ser su amiga 💖
❤️❤️❤️ what a lovely lady. Omw!
Is nobody gonna comment on her foundation shade ?
You know she’s a boss when she can do her makeup with her hair down
She should've done a skincare routine instead of a makeup routine, her skin is flawless and it GLOWS!!
I stan her literally so much and she looks gorgeous as always but the foundation not matching hurts my soul
this is gold
Rihanna is so cute! Her personality makes this video so much fun! Thank you so much for this video! It makes you feel so much more connected to her as an individual, not just as a celebrity :) she should do more makeup tutorials! 😍
you better smack that concealer you applied on your hand onto my face so it wouldn't be a waste.
That was amazing.
Best one so far
So they basically wear a fuckin mask the whole day..... Then when you wake up, you wake up to this 👹
OMG! She is soooooooooooo cute!
Wow
My queen❤❤
wow
she is the reason that you should believe in god 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I can't believe she invented make up tutorials.
WE LOVE A GODDESS ONG
She's so Beautiful.
When u use to much turmeric in ur face pack....And ur face ends up looking like that foundation 😂😂😂👍
Henna
I need a Rihanna in my life 😭
How can a drug addict that depicts women  in such a vulgar way get so much hype is something that boggles my mind!
queEN
Nice collection... plz support...
before i watched the video i was like " if she meses up i ain't gonna let this pass" but i have nothing to say this was beautiful very well executed glowy AND realy fun to watch rihanna you go girl !
She is so so cute and so chill, I love her 💕
benimle evlenir misin
I absolutely love her to bits and I love fenty. But please tell me I'm not the only one who thought the foundation she used didn't match and looked orange on her when she first put in on and it got better in the end but  it still looked a little orange . Maybe it would be nice  if she applied and spread it to her neck as well. I love her nevertheless
Riri, looking like a bonafide snacc: Nah I look fat. Me, lying in bed eating cold French fries: 🙃
I love you riri!!!!! 😭
9:14 When you're irritated with your own makeup brand. 😂

What lipstick did she use??😭😭😭

My dad walked past when she said Beech's (but the actuall word) and he went huhhhh LMFAO
She is ugly with or without makeup !!
I love u kisssss meeee rıhanna ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I would have hoped that with all of the shades of Fenty foundation she has released, she would find a foundation which is the right colour for her
“I’m kinda cute “ girl you know you are really cute ❤️

I'm not gonna lie I was never a big fan of Riri, but this humanized her. I have a very different impression of her now.
As someone with dark skin I NEEDED THIS SO BADLY WOMAN THANKYOU

When Rihanna said "SH!" at 0:19, the person probably started shaking. Imagine being told to 'sh' by Rihanna.
Rihanna is so cute. This is why she is my favorite: beautiful inside and out. Thanks for making my day and putting a smile on my face!! You go girl!
I've never been a big fan of Rihanna but this video made me love her

4 Rs my friend: Reduce Reuse Recycle...RIHANNA
This is crazy/sad Rihanna you are a really attractive woman but people are so obsessed with looks you have to put a complete mask on.
I WANT THAT BODY SHIMMER THING !!
I love Rihanna's personality so much. She seriously needs to start her own youtube channel
Did she only use mascara for her eyelashes?
it’s so entertaining to watch riri do her makeup I’m obsessed 😍😍😍
I LOOOOOOOVE HEEEEEEEEEERRRR
She looks sooooo much younger without makeup! Awwwww so cute!
She made it look so easy. I am always scared to try eye makeup on myself but I think I will try now.
That foundation looked a wrong shade at first but then it became the right shade. MAGIC! ✨Love you Riri ❤️
she's so fun to watch. look came out gorgeous 😍😍
Down to earth, humble queen!  'I have a huge forehead'..LOL. I love her.
Rihanna is very beautiful with and without makeup
A whole queen
She's EVERYTHING 😭😭😭😭
Sonsuza kadar izleyebilirim galiba 💓💓💓

I love this chic!! She so humble!
SO IS FENTY COMING OUT WITH A TRUE BRONZER FOR DARK SKIN GIRLS??
Şu tatlılığa bakar mısınız 😍😍😍😍😍 Rihanna sen nasıl bir şekerliksin !
Okay Inhave a question and I don‘t mean that in any rude way but...Rihanna has a beauty brand with a foundation range that claims to be suitable for any skintone and should have a shade for every skintone but then she uses a foundation which is way more light and orange ther her skintone? What effect do you wanna have with doing that or....?
to much make up baby!
Hwasa must be fangirling right now 😂😂😂 #Mamamoo #Moomoo
*73 Questions with Riri*
Oh my gosh she seems really down to earth and normal.. I know that seems harsh but I feel like sometimes we forget that celebrities are actual people 😂  But like. She’s adorable I love her.  EDIT: When she screamed after applying the lipgloss my dog woke up and ran out of the room.
Wut I never knew she was this cool and nice vibe. I thought she'd be like serious and diva and no she had me saying "I like her!" Through out the whole video starting with her first walk in
honestly bless vogue for making this with Rih, probably the only pop culture superstar worth following rn! What a goddess in a super down to earth way.
I don’t wear makeup but I’m loving this and if she make a YouTube page, I’ll watch every video.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
WHAT LIP GLOSS IS THAT oh myyyyy
That gave me COMPLETE LIFE !  Love Rihanna that was awesome 😎
"Sunset, summer, love, drama, BITCHES" !!!!
She's so pretty
😂😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️I lllloooovvvvveeeee hhhhhheeeeerrrr
Wow! But also can you guys get katrina Kaif to do her makeup?? Kay thanks!

Fat days haha I love you
I chocked when she didn’t blend it in the neck, but it’s Rihanna so it’s okay
i'am vogue fan 😘 î'am a Rihanna fan  And you ?  https://youtu.be/wQVoD8I7chI
“sshh... HI” lmao I’m dead
First things first you slayed this!! 😍❤️ but I love the waterline eyeshadow trick because without makeup if u have darkness and apply a dark eyeshadow to match your natural under eye it looks more natural. That way when it’s off it not like you look completely different. 😘💛
A QUEEN !!!
You slay
That eyeshadow duo, yoooooo 😍😍
this is why i love her?
i lost it when she smiled for applying her blush
Wow, she thinks she got a double chin

Yo!!! Is that an eyeshadow palette at 5:34? Like I can't find it.
QWEENNN AHHHHH ❤️❤️💜💚🔥🌈👍💞🎀💝✨😎👍🌈🔥💔😍🎊😎😘
she's way more chill than i pictured her being. I think the way she dresses and her badass persona make her seem a little intimidating but she seems really cool and normal here!
So gorgeous😍😍😍❤❤❤
Even with your own foundation and makeup line, even goddesses can pick the wrong foundation color. I feel better about myself. Well, no, because she doesn’t need foundation regardless and she’s RiRi so I still feel like a peasant.
I love Rihanna! This is everything
Rhiahnna gives me life  There’s just something bout her
She’s just a fun spirit! I want her to be my friend 😭
She's beautiful to me she inspires everyone
can someone tell me what she used on the corner of her eye for that “zest” hahaha PLS
GORGEOUS!!!
If you’re not in love with Rihanna you’re a lier
Why only face.its looks mask..cover the neck too😂😂😂
Look nice even without the make up
OH GOD SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL

My eyes feel blessed. Queen 👸. Thank you Vogue
She's so cute. She looks like a doll
Everyone’s saying her foundation is to light but that foundation dries a few shades darker. When I got mine at Sephora, there was 2 shade we were deciding on for my face and we went with the lighter one so it dried the right color✨✨
QUEEN!!!!

I love this woman
I love her omg 😂
Why is your body Brown and your face is orange?
"More is more" -Rihanna 2k18
What does she mean she is caught up about her nose cuz she’s black?
Black people often have our necks several shades darker than our faces. My face is the darker side of pecan brown but my neck is literally BLACK, charcoal black. This is due to hyper-pigmentation caused by sun damage. It is very common with us so I’m fed up with all these people of other races criticising her because they don’t understand it.
😘😘
Marry me
anyone know what lip gloss she used? I wanna get my hands on it 😍
Rihana is so funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I thought she already had makeup😀😂 Shes so pretty
I thought famous people had people to do their make up
wait.... WHERE'S THE ACCENT??? Why she sounding American now?
Her personality makes me so happy. :) and this makeup is so beautiful. I’m so proud of her fenty line. I couldn’t stop smiling through this video....
WHAT LIPGLOSS IS THAT???
RIHANNA YOURE NOT FAT I WANT YOUR BODY
How can anybody be this hot and cute at the same time?
Love it!!! 😍💛💛💛
She is not a queen she is the empress of the universe
She’s beautiful even without her makeup
I thought her makeup was already done when the video started.
SHES SO CUTE
Pink= Bitches 😂❤️
❤️
She’s so down to earth it’s insane😭😭😍😍
*QUEEN*
this is not 10 minutes because there’s alot of fast forward and cuts. looool
😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘
I feel like if it was anyone other than Rihana people would correct her on how to say “contour”
Why is her face all yellow/orange at the end? Just doesn't seem to match her skin color. Legit question
Lol🤪🤪 she’s hilarious  love her!
GIVE RIHNNA HER OWN CHANNEL NOOOOOWWWWW! Im subscribed and it dont even exist yet.
Ummm nikki tutorials who? Manny mua is quaking and jefree starr’s wig is nowhere to be found
love you rihana
She is so cute
This was the best video Ive ever seen
LOVE. OBSESSED.
i love riri.
If Rihanna uses eyeshadow for blush then it is!
she makes me want to do more makeup videos 😍😍😘 I've loved her since I was little ❤️
Ironic how no one bashes Riri for using her own products but God forbid Miranda even mention the word "Kora".. whyyyyyy
Rihanna has my full consent.
Her foundation doesn't match her? and she puts on way more than she needs to
I like her.
Dayum Rihanna youuuu Beautiful !!!!!!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
sooo can Ri just make her own youtube channel or WHAT??!

Esa piel tan bonita no necesita maquillaje , es hermosa !
She lowkey looks like Kennedy Davenport and I’m HERE for it
Elle est moche en faite
Finally a celebrity who actually wears make up
Great video... When you get a chance, please check out “Glam Doll Si” on YouTube
even my girl riri cant shade match
She did not have to shade herself talking about some “concealer is used to hide..... bad decisions” 😂😂😂 I love how real she is😂😂🧡❤️🧡
She has like an older sister vibe! A really chill personality didnt know she was like that.
She's life. I love her so much.
absolutely gorgeous <3
She is soooooo gorgeoussss ♥️♥️♥️
Did Rihanna just say,” I feel KINDA cute” ????
My love 😍😍💕💕💕🌺
Omg GORG!!! You on fire baby RiRi 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
she is sooo prettyyy
🇧🇷 🇧🇷
All you MUA watch out! Rihana is her to take you entire career !!
She is seriously so FLAWLESS
I'm impressed rhianna
Rihanna says she's been wearing the fenty foundation for over a year, and NO ONE said anything about the color of her foundation until this video. It's clearly her color if you check out her red carpet pics or any event pics.

https://youtu.be/urwY5FNTOpE
She's so soothing to hear. She's so real! She's so herself. I love her even more now!❤
My vibe for the summer is “more is more” 😂 I love RiRi 😫
I love the way you put make up on your face 😍💋💕
She's such a baddie 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Gahdamn she’s gorgeous
i love uuuuuu gurllll
Now I know why they say Riri bad! Girls, a goddess, absolutely stunning and cool. Feels like I'm sitting in the bathroom with a girlfriend!
I think she's *really good* at make up
is she drunk?
Omg I never realized how hilarious she is!! Makes me love her even more. She really seems like a warm, nice, chill person too. That was actually a very good tutorial. I’m impressed. 😊😘
My queen
Whaaaat she doesnt do Eyebrow tutoriaaal... But still loook pretty thougj
Omg yes! I’m living and dying at the same time! 😭😍😚💨
You should have a YouTube channel 😊😘
My queen 💕😍🤘🏾
She uses a wrong color for her foundation, way too yellow for her
HONESTLY WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE RIHANNA
God, I love her!!! She is such a GODDESS!!! 😍💋❤️😘👑
Yes , without a doubt beautiful without makeup  but the makeup enhances the beauty and frames it . Imagine  the Mona Lisa painting without a frame .
Love Rihanna 💖 she is 100%
Love riri
Lol I love her “concealers made for hiding bad decisions” 😂😂
I LOVE her vibe. She's every girl when they're feeling themselves.
She kinda looks like Kennedy Davenport without mug
I already love Rihanna but this vid made me love her 10000x more 😩😍❤️
Favorite one! I just love her so much!!!!!!!!!!!!
QUEEN!!! 👑
I wonder if that’s her lingerie line she’s wearing
How somebody can be that perfect?! 😍😍 She's completly a godneeesssss 😍😍🌷🌷🌷🔥
Does anyone know what lipgloss she put on 😭😭
What a queen 👸🏽 I lover her 💕
“Get it?”   “Ye”
That 4head tho
This is my religion
❤️
What a beautiful bathroom
i’m sad this ended
What a babe
Not gonna lie, this is honestly the first time I've heard Rihannas talking voice.
Why did she gain weight? Is she pregnant?
Isn’t she lovely?
i love you ❤❤😗❤😭💖💜💙
“Hide that double chin” Rhiiii, where 😩😭
Does her brow bone real? It looks so good, it's like she have wing subtle shadow
Rihanna & Bretman Rock collab pls
10:08 you're welcome.
What she use in her inner corner?????
Vogue out here blessing us all
She's adorable :(
She is so Beautiful
2.6 million views in 17 hours? Now that's a queen impact
Rihanna needs her own YouTube channel like will smith omg 😫😫😫😫❤️❤️❤️❤️
UGH YESSSS FINALLY
Love her
She is just perfect OMG, and so funny... she is the best 💖💖💖
I’m a guy I don’t know wth she’s talking about but I’m here for beautiful Rihanna.
Beautiful. But, It's a NO for that foundation
I don’t think anyone can understand how much I love Rihanna 🙅🏾‍♂️ ❤️
i love her omg
She is a natural beauty. No need for all that gunk on the face, way too much makeup, not good for skin.
She's hella cute doing her makeup 😭😂💖
My Queen is the realest
a tutorial that I’ve been waiting all my life
One of the best Youtube contents
She actually has such a personality 😍 so cute and sassy!!
Her personality is so cute I can’t take it 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
whattta queeen😻😻😻
why is she so precious....
ASMRIH
😩😩😩 I didn’t even think she did her own “full face” of makeup...this makes me love her even more and a tad bit jealous because she makes it look so easy...I couldn’t even keep up because she’s so gorg!!!
I learned so much more tips in this one video then in all other Mua videos 😭
Omg she would be sooo good at ASMR, no??
She’s a goddess
Woah
Does anybody know the name of the lipstick she used??? I. NEED. IT.
How is this literally rihanna and her foundation is so bad it doesn't match?????
Gurl, she doesn't even need makeup! She's a natural beauty😍😍😍
Rihanna is everything!
Isn’t the fondation a little too... yellow ??
love u Ri u keep it real
I love her ! She's so cute and funny lmao
I love this. Really got to see a side of Rihanna that you don’t really get to see normally. I also think cardi B and Rihanna would have good chemistry personality wise. I would loooooove a collab with the two of them.
The reason I breathe.
That highlight brought your face to life 😍😍😍
love u Rih! You are the insperation <3
LOVE HER even more
She is so iconic
She needed to blend her face with her neck - 2 very different colours. Otherwise, that was a really nice look ❤️
I just love Rihanna so much!
Beautiful
wait what lip product is she using bc it's so beautiful
If I had a dollar every time I said "omg I love her" during this vid I would be a millionaire
that makes her so approachable, I don't feel that stars are superhumans anymore
QUEEEEEEEEEEEN! 💜🔥
Someone tell rihanna to start a youtube channel😉😉😉😉
Queen👑
“I look fat” WHATTTTTTTTTT SIS COME ON NOW 😑❤️

funny and pretty makeup icon
Seriously just fell in love with Rihanna
I need to know what lip gloss that is though
Rihanna is cute af
She is such a gem
You forgot the word "without" in the title.

Rihanna is synonymous with beauty
Any video with rihanna in the title/ thumbnail automatically gets mire views than average lol
Oh my god she looks gorgeous
I love her muuuuch
She really could've skipped the foundation because her skin is FLAWLESS 😍✨
Am i seriously the only one that noticed there’s something between her bottom teeth ???? Gurllll your telling me the editor didn’t see this either ?🤔
i never knew i needed this
I was captivated through the whole video. Rihanna is a Goddess.
Bella Rihanna!
That foundation is orange on her. But she slays that makeup tutorial
imagine being this pretty
You are the best
MAMIII
i didn't know she was so fun.
RiRi, you're alllllllllways looking cute <3
if it was the wrong foundation it wouldn't of matched her skin after she was done so SHHH.
Imagine if Rihanna had her own Youtube channel... Jeez!!
Queen 💗☺
I never thought Rihanna could be as relatable as this.
when rihanna’s video is the only beauty secret video with applause at the end 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Does anyone know what the lip gloss is?! I NEED IT!!

This is  the only tutorial I need
She gorgeous with and without makeup
My sweet sweet Riri...

She's awesome
I can't believe she teased more killawatt and gloss!!! As if I'm not already broke after buying her beach collection 😫...Now I need everything she just put on 😍 and that bronzer
I love how much she’s feelin herself 😍😍😍
A.R.T PURE A.R.T!!!
cutest human being eVER
Time for Rihanna to start a YouTube Channel / Beauty Videos ❤
She makes a big forehead look so prettty 😂😭😭
YAAASSSS MA QUEEN ♥
For all of you saying her foundation doesn’t match her skin nor neck: if you were listening she DID say she was sun burnt, that explains why she looks a whole different tone. Riri made a whole makeup line, you think she wouldn’t know her shade? 😘
This video should have been called how to fall in love with Rihanna in 10 minutes 😍
I LOVE HER SOO MUCH shes soooo funny 💗💓💕💞💖💞💕💓💓💗❤️❤️❤️
i need her to make her own channel now
She looked better without the pink eye shadow :/
This was only 10 minutes because you sped up and cut out parts...
so cute!!!!
what shade foundation are u wearing?
Rihanna’s voice is heavenly. Why there wasn’t a makeup tutorial by her before I don’t know 🤷🏻‍♀️ lol gotta day this made me want to go out to Sephora and buy more of her products lol. Great video!
I watched this like 3 times
Is it weird that I got tingles
This is so monocramatic I love it, also love how she's not using a million and one brushes .
Hi Vogue Rihanna you are amazing so beautiful and timeless thank you for the tutorial 😊🌟🤩
Double chin!?? Riri where..?
This is hilarious! She looks just like her.
What lip gloss is that? I need it!!!
Love it !!  Would love her on my channel!!!! 😘❤️❤️
So in love with this video 😭  ❤️
wtf. how can I look like her pls someone tell me
😍😍
I will forever love Ri she’s my mommma
Rihanna is a blessing!! 😍😍😍
Omg 😂 5:47

She's perfect 💓✨😍
I’ve missed you RIRI! Glad to see new interviews! :)
So..when can we get 73 questions with Rihanna? 🤔
The beauty queen
Lowkey looking like the old (new) Pon De Replay Riri 😍👑🌞💜
On behalf of everyone on earth I'm just gonna say thank you for this video.

"Hide that double chin" BITC WHERE
She's beautiful with or without makeup but I felt she could have gone a shade deeper/darker than the one she used. I was worried for a sec when she put one the foundation lol. End result though, slayed!
Everybody who dislike this secretly loves it ❤️
Whats color her foundation?
Wish she was my bff 😭
my parents r asleep rn and trying not to SCREAM omfg
I love the way she says contour. She's so beauty, now I need to get me some Fenty! She has such a sweet personality. I met her once at an album release and she was so kind & nice to everyone. Such a beauty!
She’s so perfect like what I wish and her accent is so amazing and her vocals and JUST HER IN GENERAL!!!!!!! I love her so much
Rihanna you just too perfect, I thought she already had make up on at the start of the video❤❤💖
Me enamora esta mujer 🌹 muy acertada las sombras para sus ojos verdes💗 Pd: viendola maquillarse me entraron ganas de maquillarme a mi jajajajajaj

Step 1: Be Rhianna  *cries*
I love you 100000 times more than I did before watching this x
I literally cannot believe how down to Earth she freaking is
I know nothing about makeup, but I can watch Rihanna tutorials all day and learn
Okay. Here we go. Rihanna. It amazes, and by amaze i mean baffles me that u got in vogue using a foundation that is not the correct skin tone. In fact its a shade lighter. U made an entire line for the black boys n girls in the world. Yet u came on camera wearing a foundation that isnt correct. U literally made a line for every skin tone....why arent u using the correct one... At first i thought it was the light but it isnt. Look at the thumbnail. I mean that was a choice...
She's so adorable.
awesome video!!! i post covers of ariana, sza, and moreee and would love if u could check out my vids(,: just tryna get out there!! subscribe if u like themmmmm!!! thaaankkuuu
"Gosshhhh that forehead is HUUGGEE" !!! luv u girl but i can't help but to look at it while you doing ur foundation!
My baby! #Navy4ever
okay but with a thousand colors of her own foundation she still uses the wrong one i dont get it
It's like i was just Laying on my friends bed Watching my mate doing her make up lol I loved it
I mean she’s a cutie 😍
I fuckn love this woman..
I love you RiRi! 😘😘😘
She's so adorable!!!!
omg i love her she's so cute
I need to know what is the product she used on her eye’s corner... someone can tell me please? 😍😍
I love Riri.. But is it just me who sees her right hand like a man's hand? 😨😨😨😨
8:43 Found my new alarm...

Badgalriri ily
This is just a lowkey ad for fenty, get that coin sis lmao
Omg she had no makeup on b4 she so naturally pretty
Anyone else peep the SavageX necklace? And is that a sneak peek of the lingerie she wearing? ┬┴┬┴┤(･_├┬┴┬┴
i love ri but her foundation is too orange... :(

Unpopular opinion: I don't get the hype/worship dealing with this woman and what she does. By all means though...keep loving her, sheep herd ✌🏻
Aaaahhh love yaaa Ri💕✨💕🙏🏼
i’m literally in love with her
How is she so normal?! She seems so down to earth and sweet which I don't understand how she has remained this way being such a superstar but it makes me love not only her music but her as well <3
Www.iridescencebeauty.com

Does anyone else love the way she says contour ??
She needs a channel😩
Her laugh and smile omg it brightens my entire mood instantly!!
omg she should be a beauty guru she's so freaking cute and amazing😍😍
Like a little HINT
the way she says contour is the cutest thing ever. this was the cutest video ever i love u badgalriri. best vogue video so far!!!!
I learned how to contour when I got fat. ME ME ME ME ME. We love a relatable queen.
She slayed 😍🔥
I....I love her.
Love ya 😍💖
Can she create makeup, yes. Can she do makeup, 🤔🙅🏾‍♀️
riri that foundation is too yellow for ya
What's the shade of the foundation ! 😭
Wtf she wasn't wearing makeup at the beginning??? What kind of goddess
Yes riri!
Okay so de *REAL* question is...when we getting that brow tutorial fam? #BajanPosse
I can't even speak right now
Te amo, te amo 💕
.. if I see one more comment about the foundation.. 😑 I know half of you were distracted by how beautiful she is even without make up, BUT SHE DID SAY THAT SHE GOT SUNBURNT. That's probably why she mentioned it.. js. 🙄
this was fun
i need that brush
im a guy, and i bappen to not wear make up but i couldnt turn away
I'm not crying over her cuteness people
Queeen
She seems fun. Great job!
Girl I love you but thank shade is to yellow for you my queen
This is so relaxing . . . Her voice is soothing ,  she should do asmr
SHE'S SO PRETTY AND AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED AND HER VOICE IS SO NICE AND SHE'S SO CUTE ARGGHHHHHHHHHHH
what a queen wow 😍👏🏽
WE DO NOT DESERVE HER!!!!!
Oh and I guess no one has ever bought the wrong color foundation. Everyone does not match to their neck. Many make-up artists find the middle tone btwn neck face and chest.
Make up is really for white women.
😍😍😍😍😍
my babbbyyy
Ma niggah
She ended all the makeup gurus' career. RIHANNA SNAPPED. 💀
OMG Rihanna forever💋❤
This makes me stan Rihanna. Like we knew she was a queen but now she’s my queen
Fuckin love her❤️❤️❤️❤️but this girl don’t need makeup
Queeeennnn
She's so adorable I stg
I love her
KWEEEEEEN
such a beauty queen
Bro I don’t even notice her forehead cus her beauty covering it up😍😍😍she literally is perfect😩😩and listing to her voice is actually soothing😍😭😭
The view and the subscribes are the same 😂😂
Awesome! Love rihanna
Omgggg she's sooo beautiful  *-* and looks so down to earth and funny
She is so cute I cannot take it!!
that my new slang " More is MORe " lol  #luvURi
why is she literally so fun to watch no matter what she’s doing
Y'all are always trying to put people down. Riri got sunburned so of course her foundation wouldn't match. She owns a whole makeup line, if she needed new foundation she could get some. Also she's rolling in money so she could buy all the foundation in the world is she wanted too.    Ps. It oxidizes so of course it'll get darker later. Mind your business because last time I checked you do your makeup with free samples
I have the biggest crush on Rihanna ever.
Rainhaaaaa!!!
Maravilhosa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ filha da Beyoncé
She’s perfection 👌❤️
예쁘다👍🏻👍🏻
Luv that highlighting contour !!! That lipgloss to!! Working it i bet you can out do your makup artist any day!  Check out ... Help I'm Turning Into Cat Woman

i love how shes says contour
"hide that double chin" ARE U SURE ABOUT THAT SENTENCE RIHANNA???
So gorgeous !!!
Drake is watching this crying right now I promise you.
OMG. GIVE HER A SHOW. PLEASE.
She is just amazing😩
why isn’t this trending
I need that blush brush
Idk if it’s the camera or lighting, but her neck doesn’t match her face at all.
She has a freakin flawless face😭😭💜
She’s cute.
Who remembers when the media was all about Rihanna’s forehead lol. Girl I have a big forehead too. Pretty girls always have big foreheads lol. But ain’t nobody remembers Rihanna Forehead these days and I love how she actually talks about real issues females face on a day to day when doing their make up. Like nose contours double chins lol
she's so hot ohmygod
Omg she’s so beautiful
For those talking about how light her foundation is... It does oxidize.  Duh... Anyone that has seen a review knows that...besides even if it is the wrong shade, everyone clicked to see HER.  GROW UP!
Stunning! 😩😍
Sou homem, mas fiquei agoniado com a diferença do pescoço para o rosto hahahahahaha
I am Asian but I always wanna look like Asian Rihanna. But obviously that’s impossible. No one can be this gorgeous 😍.
She really just wasted all that concealer on her hand....
There's something about her that is so alluring.. dude, I could listen to her talk all day and I'd never be bored.
such a queen 👑 😍
babeeeee 🔥😍
DIOGO PARÓDIAS? 😂😂😂😂
So pretty i am gonna to use this make up tutorial once i got my own makeup😻😻

Her voice is so nice 😍
Step 1. Have perfect face
I wish I knew the names of the makeup she uses?
Jesus f...ing christ, if i put that much make up, as a man, i would look way better than her! There is at least 1 mm make up on her face...
0:06 me every time I look in the mirror 😂😂
She’s kind of an eloquent speaker
I have a gigantic girl crush on her.
I want her to be my mom
She look different without Photoshop
QUEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
She's adorable I love her

Hi Rain
MY MOM
Iconic.
Rihanna is a fun girl...❤❤😊
We need more Rihanna, please
Hahahah so cute
She did that so easily and it looks so professional. I'm shook.
“I feel kinda cute” RIRI STOP PLAYIN!! YOURE BEAUTIFUL😭💕
Fenty can do no wrong!!!!!
How can you not love Rihanna like seriously 💛 her we Bestfriends she just don’t know yet 😂
Summer, sunset, love, drama, *BITCHES*
Loveya Queen!
concealers are meant to "hide bad decisions" love it.
Flawless 😍
2018 and the rest of the existence is saved
I love her
She is using the correct color combination for contour. All these idiotic beauty gurus apply extremely dark colors and make it look good with jump cuts & off camera corrections...& their audience actually falls for it. In reality the contour shade must only be a few tones darker than your skin.
i know you guys are saying her foundation doesn’t match but you can’t really compare to her chest when she just said she got sunburned
Was that a colourpop lippie!
Wifey being wifey
Way to sell your product girl!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Honestly the most beautiful woman in the world
WHAT IS THAT GLOSS CALLED
The queen has broken the internet yet again
makeups on makeups? Genius!
when she said "bad decisions" it kinda sounded like she sang LMAO
😒 i wish I could say I love her....but nah no personality there.
She even looked flawless before any of the makeup!? What’s the secret sis
sometimes i feel like i look like her.... but then i look at her for 1 more micro second and i go 'this gal is way toooooo beautiful" i love her
Can she please make a YouTube channel 😫
She's funny 😂😂
"I have a huge forehead"😶 man i love and respect riri big forehead and new weight and all😍
What a goddess
Why is she so beautiful😩
She is an entire vibe!!
More RiRi please 😍
😍😍😍😍!
Was this a new Fenty eyeshadow!?!? I can't even, stunning!!!
I LOVE HER <3
Wow what a human 💜👐🏼👌🏼👏🏼
Top Comment should be: Rihanna doesn't need makeup.
watch every make up guru inmate riri make-up style now "Make a triangle under chin, to hide ur double chin" 😒.
Slay queen 👑

Omg I loveeeee the look. But that lipgloss!!! 😍
I’m kind of confused..why does her foundation on her face look like it doesn’t match her neck color? It looks more yellow-toned than her neck is. Did anyone else think that? - But other than that, LOVED this video & her personality is so sweet ✨❤️
whats that pink highlighter ?
Loveee Rih! 😍❤️✨
Omg my name is Rihanna but with one n insted of two
It's my first time to watch her make up videos or any american make up tutorials cause i'm really into korean make up .

Did anyone watch the start thinking 'she doesn't need makeup'?
SOLD!! going to buy all these products

I love her

Rihanna is human???
Not crazy about this look, love her music though
She’s so beautiful that it’s not even funny omgggg💗💗💗💗😍😍😍😍😍😍

Loved the video.  Also, love, love, love my Fenty foundation.  However, I have a problem with putting it under my eyes.  It burns like crazy but I haven't found a foundation with that perfect color for me like Fenty.  Got any advice or do you have anything for sensitive skin?  I don't want to give it up... :(
Love her 😍😍😍

traduz ai mermão
es natural que la cara se vea amarilla y el resto de la piel en otro color? es broma? ya sabemos porque paga para que la maquillen
I love her so much omg
She's like the best makeup guru i've ever seen so far, tbh 😍 So fun to watch and not dull at all 😂
Robyn Rihanna Fenty is a GODDESS!!!!!!!!
I didn’t even know I wanted this. But is EVERYTHING!!!!
YOU ARE FLAWLESS
She's such a beauty 😘love you babe❤❤❤
im sorry, but i dont like the makeup look.
I will never get over this
She's wearing a bra omg it's been soo long since I've seen her in one. Lol
So no ones going to mention that that isn’t her foundation shade??
She has lost so much of her accent. I remember hearing her interview at 18. U barely could understand her. She is so beautiful!
Rihanna is a ray of sunshine 🌞😍❤

Shes's so beautiful, but... I just see a woman with a yellow face :/ the color of the foundation is incorrect, it's too light and yellow for her. Without makeup (or no makeup-makeup) she's still beautiful <3

You look so much better without all that makeup.
SHE IS THE QUEEN riri I love you ❤
Very nice
She’s so adorbs right here, she seems so full of cheer, and carefree.. it’s really hard not to like her when she’s so laid back, and winded down.
This girl is amazing. Funny AF!!!
What is that body shimmer she uses
I swear I love her personality! She’s just as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside 💜

Who is this. This is not rihanna.  Is this her clone
YASSS QUEEEEEENNNNN 😭😭😩😩😍😍💦💦💦 I love her so much but its funny because this is the first time I've actually ever heard her speak
😍😍😍
I love her omggg
She so pretty I love her so much ❤️❤️😍💛💛
I feel better that im not the only one with a different shade of foundation. Rihanna can pull it off then anyone can lol watch everyone start doing it just because of this video lol
shes so beautiful😭
when will i ever
Didnt knw that rihanna is naturally funny ☺️
"that's only half my face," proceeds to blend forehead 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I just love her so much
Do you  know  Drake👊.
Her natural skin looks a lot better😍😍😍😍
RiRi needs a YT Channel!!😭💛
even Rihanna can't get the right foundation shade
9:03 😍 french ok is good
Fact that she doesn't need makeup! Such a beauty!
si muy guapa Rihanna pero no se supone que su linea de maquillaje tiene 60 o 40 tonos de base porque se pone uno más claro?? Si notan la cara de un color y el cuello digo si fuera yo se me van encima y soy lo peor del mundo y aquí todos aplaudiendo, diciendo que bonito hace su maquillaje???
NO HATE but I think that lighting doesn't do her foundation justice
She is exagered with this make up !

QUEEN
I seen this video early. 😂 I love Rihanna😍😘💖
I became a cosmetic buyer back in 1972 through the owner of a large drug store. First he had me compete with 2 other girls for a pharmacy tech, to see who could count the fastest, pour the fastest, compound creams, answer none stop phone, weigh on customers, fill out insurance papers, talk directly to Dr's, ect,ect back then no computers. So since every drug store has cosmetics, there were Representatives ( such as Revlon,LOreal ect) who came to talk to my boss and he nvr knew what to buy, so he needed a cosmetic buyer and since I wore make up, he asked me if I was willing to go to Revelon school of cosmetics for 2 weeks they would pay for it I said Yes. Went got my certificate and became cosmetic buyer for the drug store along with  also still being a pharmacy tech. Loved doing both jobs, I learned alot about medicine and cosmetics.  You hear Riri say she can put on her make up in 10 min? It's All True bc I did it too bc putting it on every day you just on autoplay. I use to tell everyone I could put my makeup blindfolded except the eyelashes. And the creams Riri talks about mixing I did the exact same thing but with lipsticks, i use to used brown eye shadow for my eyebrows, mixed different  hair colors to get a beautiful hair color,  So, being a cosmetic buyer I learned alot and had so much fun with it, Revlon and Loreal treated me wonderful. I got free cosmetics bc everything i bought for the store it sold  quickly. This is why I use to get alot of compliments. I would humbly help ladies with their makeup. Im sorry if I went on & on. But this is how I became a cosmetic buyer.
She’s actually the sweetest and cutest 💓💓
9:14 Meme 😂
love her so much!! ❤️❤️❤️
“I have a huge forehead” 😂 still beautiful af
Wait she wasn't wearing foundation in the beginning 😮 her skin is flawless!
Does anybody know What shade She used😭😍
I want her to do more things like this! I love to see her as a regular human being.
Riri doesn't need make-up, she looks beautiful with or without it❤💯
Rih is obviously beautiful but cool af too! You already know it would be so much fun being friends with her b/c she has such a good sense of humor. Caribbean Queen 👑👑👑💜💜💜
Rihanna looks flawless with or without😂
Love her
her lips ❤
She looks like zoe saldana omg!
LOVEEE!!
I feel like she is pregnant, caution I’m not fat shaming but honestly she may be pregnant or she can be totally comfortable with her skin to gain wait which is fine😊

Just think about "Fenty" is actually her surname. Then the video caption sounds a bit ridiculous.

i think your foundation is a little to yellow toned for your skin but your still killing it !
I never knew I needed this until now

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na3eUGe3zQ0  CLICK THE LINK FOR SOMETHING AWESOME!
I love her voice .
She’s such a queen
I never seen so much beauty with out makeup
I have recreated this tutorial and it will be up on my channel in a couple hours, I'm guessing 4h. It's almost the same lol, very funny tho!!
Positive videos
Ok Rihanna you need to start that beauty channel! I need too see more of your perfect face and personality!
Rihanna is so funny i love her!
I'm a Bigger Fan Now
She’s so silly, I love her so much!!
Why did this have to end????? 😢😂
I have come to the conclusion that this woman has no flaws she is just gorgeous inside and out 😍😍😍
Can you please come out with an app for all your products
I wish Rihanna would become a YouTuber😍😩id watch all of her videos
I must say that I really think this was great, I am not good with makeup but I try and watch a lot of YouTube. I have to say that I learned a few things and that the best part. It's nice to see her in this form. I don't think Rihanna is really going to ever read her comments that's what she has her staff for but I will say the clapping at the end was a little weird because when you watch Makeup tutorials most are alone. At the same time it's Rihanna and you can see that her peoples are proud of her and that's sweet. I wish her the best with her makeup line.
The way she says contour is adorable
She is sooooo beautiful
Muito maravilhosa!
Riri love u ♥
This is cute but I’m waiting on 73 questions thank you!!!!
why she didn't show how she makes brows and lashes??🤔🤔

I love Rihanna so much omfg
I just love her. It's like my girlfriend or sister playing around talking about covering up their perceived flaws and highlighting their fine points. We can ALL relate. Lolol. Can't stop watching. She's a comedian.
THE ACTUAL QUENN HER SELF😍😍
*Rihanna* : i have a huge forehead, double chin, eye bags, i gained weight  *me looking at my reflection in the mirror that seems to have just come out of a detoxification center* : nice
Spoiler alert!!! She can't match her skin tone!!! 😏😏😏
beauty😍.
The only beauty guru that matters
am i the only one who thinks her foundation doesn't match her neck
I love her LIPS! NAILS ON FLEEK!
I wanna be rihanna in my next life😇😇😇
we stan a humble, quirky, funny down to earth queeeeeen!!!
riririririririririririri <3
10 mins and not 2 !!!
Her foundation looks so orange compared to her real skin color wth
Is that her natural eye color? Sometimes it's hazal sometimes it's greyish
What a beautiful person. Love this
This gave me life
the only vogue get ready with me that knows how to put on makeup
I need Rihanna to start making YouTube videos!! Thanks!! 💕
I love her omg
Queen 👑👑👑💕💕
i have big forehead so i always mimic rihanna hairstyles lol ..
Love her sense of humor ☺️
AN ACTUAL QUEEN.
i love you Riri !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I felt like she was actually talking to me ❤❤❤ love riri
She’s such a babe
she's so beautiful and danm Rihanna
She 👏 wasn't 👏 wearing 👏 makeup👏
SO BEAUTIFUL wow she is fire
QUEEN ❤️
This is the perfect summertime makeup look ☀️🌴👙
I cant afford to “warm up” my concealer like that lmao
She's so lovely😘😘😘
She’s over rated she seems like a good nice person but she is not perfect. Personality or physically. I like her a lot but look she’s not perfect.
finally!!!
“I look kinda cute” she says.. GIRL, WHEN DO YOU NOT LOOK CUTE?? Such a beauty, inside and out 💕
i love how the contour is grey-toned. It emulates a shadow more realistically in my opinion. Yellow-toned contour looks so...weird compared to grey contour.
I feel like I can do makeup now
90% of the comments here r talking about her foundating, like stop she contoured her face and bronzed it ,at the end of the video  her face is matching her neck ;)
living for this
“It only takes me long when I’m procrastinating”      Girl, same
Anyone know what lip gloss that was? its gorgeous!!
a queen👑👑
7:26 Me when i see some fine dude thats also smart
Oh Dear🙏😊❤ We love U
If only I could look as good in 10 minutes. :O So beautiful!
If only I could look like that in ten minutes. :O So beautiful!
There is a reason is so successful and it isn't luck, she is amazing! Could she actually be funnier than she is beautiful? My favourite line was when she was talking about how she chooses her makeup look 'depends who I am going to see' :)
shes funny i love her
I fuxking love herrrrrrr
I love how she didnt change anything about herself.. people make fun of my huge forehead and nose as well.. it looks very similar to hers. She makes me feel so much better about it <3
howdafuk did i get here?
Ugh I love her bathroom  😂😂
J’ai trop kiffé quand elle a dit  ”voilà “🤗😍
RI ARE YOU GOING TO RELEASE THAT BLUSH PALETTE?!?!??!?!?! I LOVEEE
73 questions with Rihanna plz
This was everything honestly. Loved it. And as for her foundation shade when she was highlighting around her nose she did say she was sun burnt.
She is so funny and sweet, i wanna be her friend😂
Omg I LOVE HER SO MUCH
Why her lips are so perfect?😍🔥
Dammm that highlight can I please have that thank you
Rihanna is the real definition of beauty.

I don’t like her makeup 😩 but her personality is A1

I really do hope that Riri isn't just into the makeup industry, and left music aside, please it's been awhile not saying you should give up makeup, really don't want you to, but I miss the music type Riri

She’s so amazing
PLS MAKE MIRANDA SINGS DO A MAKE UP TUTORIAL
I could listen to her say contour forever
Love herrrrr❤️❤️❤️
Am I the only one that noticed the foundation nowhere near her skin color? She looked like she had an orange explode on her face. I love her music and how she looks in videos, but come on, this makeup was not up to her usual level.
God took time creating her gorgeous woman
By far the best make-up tutorial and realest celebrity with a makeup line! Omg! Yes!

people talking about her foundation being the wrong color but did y’all forget, her foundation oxidizes which it did by the end of the video. it looks fine lol
RIHANNA WHERE IS THE MUSIC SIS??

Riri is soo REAL, soo beautiful.. I'm not surprised  she does her own makeup " She's A Pisces " and thts a gift she has...Im a 71yr old Pisces and I was a cosmetic buyer and I got so many compliments,  I loved helping ppl.  She has the most beautiful face, and her eyes are just beautiful.. She is down to earth & real.and I know a beautiful heart tht goes with it.
She's so cute! Ugh, I love her.

She is such a beauty and love her personality.
Every hint of that Bajan accent I hear gives me LIFE.

She should make a loose powder to clean up under that contour
love you Riri 😘💔💔
🤦🏼‍♀️🔥🔥🔥🔥.
She’s so beautiful, she doesn’t even need makeup 💄

*Can you just become a YouTuber. I mean what can’t you do riri?* 😭😭
I like how this shows her playful personality. I’m in love. 😍

Voilaaa
Considering she launched 40 foundation shades you’d think she’d be able to use one that actually matched...
Riri is one of a kind
Haha. I love her personality.
I love her!!! but she used the wrong foundation shade. But whatever, she is soo funny and cool, I just love her, and u can everything in her face and still look THAT good, you see contour, highlighter, eyeshadow, blush, everything!!!  #savagex
We love Rihanna and all of her beauty
Queen😭😍
“Everybody knows concealer is made for hiding bags, dark circles, hang overs... BAD DECISIONS” 😂👍🏽
i didn’t think i could love Rihanna more, i stand corrected.
Why didn’t she show us the Bronzer...is there something in the works Auntie Fenty???👀👀🤧
*She don't need to say "hi guys I'm Rihanna.." cause we all know who she is! Even when you are in Zimbabwe!*
What highlighter is that?!!!!
👑
I never thought i would be this close to Rihanna's face
Beauty gurus is over you bitches
Rihanna tryna take ALL my money
you are getting FAT!
You have a baby face I like your makeup!
A própria Rihanna falou que engordou e o povo fica aí de mimimi!
What are all the products she’s using
She’s so silly & beautiful ❤️
I love Rihanna but how does this have anything to do with being 10 minutes tf?
A true queen uses her own products
She’s the funniest person!! I love it!! Also, I agree highlight is everything 😍😍
Any guys watching? I am here to respect women 😂😂😂😂😂
I CAME HERE TO SEE HOW THE ICONIC BROWS ARE SHAPED AND I DIDN'T GET THAT I FEEL ATTACKED BY THE AMOUNT OF CUTENESS RIHANNA IS SERVING AHH
Just watching this gave me life...her personality really came to life. ♥️
Rihanna saying “contour” is everything right in the world😍
She’s so cute! 😍
Omg i love her
you mean she DIDN'T have makeup on in the beginning?????😱
i love ri
She is so beautiful
I have been blessed

She’s always going to look so bloody youthful! That face.. she’s got such a baby face (in a good way) but also such a feminine face! Omg she’s so beautiful
tbh i don't think that's the right color for her foundation
Riri should be youtuber am I right?
YESS MOM 💞🦋✨
A relatable queen
I need more ✨✨✨
SHES SUCH A SWEETY😘😍😍😩
Why is the foundation yellow???

Girl you slay but this foundation is for sure not your shade
If Rihanna can wear the "wrong" shade of foundation....SO CAN I! <3
Love her‼️❤️❤️
Sis said when I gained weight, girl where?
Rihanna gushing over her makeup line reminds me of a kid at candy store except it's girls at the makeup store lol
She looks amazing 😍😍😍😍

Just so you know others celebrities or models who did this kind of video doing their makeup or skincare routine for vogue usually have like 2-3minutes. Rihanna got 10 freaking minutes. Shes that important. God bless this queen. FREAKING BEAUTIFUL
Riri really should start a youtube channel apart to do vlogs and such but then again she prolly extremely busy to do one

"WE GOING TO THE CLURRB" sndsndsdd

Riri can be perfect youtuber!!
Rihanna best person!

What lipgloss is that
What gloss does she use?
I love you
I played the video on repeat to actually listen to her talking ❤
I would love to meet riri ahhhh she’s slaying us all 😍
I love her😍😍
Double chinnn?!?!? Where
I ♡ Rihanna! So much life.
Why did she use a foundation extremely light for her? Also her contourn shade. Why not slaying her real skin color?
“No I look fat.” WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That triggered me.
Beautiful and hilarious
queen rihanna's  now it time for queen beyonce's
I love my girl riri
LOVE IT! GOOD JOB MISS RIRI
What's the lipgloss brand and name? NEEEEEED
It’s nice to see such videos. now I know she is actually real
Oh good , i love you ❤
Riri u killed it ! 💘💘💘
MMMOOOOOMMMM
I NEED THAT GLOSS RIGHT NOWWW
Love you Riri thank you for the tutorial❤
A total doll...shes so heavenly😍😍😍🔥🔥
the best vogue tutorial okurrr!
Riri is so amazing, she can do no wrong❤️❤️😍😍
wheres the album rih rihhhh😭😭😭
"Because I'm black you know, this is a very special nose" 😂 love it
I'm just soo in love with her 😭
I enjoyed this. She’s a trip. Loved the look
I only came here to see what brow products you use and you skipped the whole thing Ri!
Sonunda yüzüne doydum, daha ne diyim ?
So what you're telling me... is... there is a new eyeshadow range.. coming out.      Rihanna WILL have my coins.
summer...sunset...love...drama... *BITCHES*
Not fair. I wanted to see how you do your eyebrows😥
Yes ma’am, shamelessly promote your products! They are worth the hype,
she’s sunburned & the foundation changes color
Aaawww your forehead is so cute
Riri is life
Her personality 😍❤️
i want all that makeup right now!!!!!!
Rihanna is a GODDESS 😍🙌🏽😩
A QUEEN
0:40 wtf is wrong with your foundation?! 😂😂 Riri is looking like SpongeBob
Rihanna is the SEXIEST woman alive. This is not up for debate!!!!
I wish she blended her foundation with her neck! it was looking real yellow lol I feel it could've been better as a whole but love riri anyway
The most gorgeous girl EVER! her beauty is endless!
Wow.. she really doesn’t match her foundation to her skin tone!! ;(
SHE IS SO HOT I LOVE HER!
Okay Rihanna should start a You Tube channel!
This is just a big Product placement...
Her eyes are so so so beautiful
Honestly there were times where I thought she had make up and then shes like now we're moving to lips... like wtf
livvin’ for this!!
When she said “no, I look fat.” All I could think was that she disapproves of looking “fat”, therefore probably thinks the same of “fat” people. Here she says she’s all about equally!
REALLY girl?!!! You are perfect 👌🏼 she can has her own YT channel. She has the voice and the personality to do it. Rihanna giving us all her FENTY empire in one video of vogue.  She really is a boss, she really thought and waited for her empire. I can't wait for more
Rihannah ladies and gentleman 😍
The Queen!!!
Me looking at her doing a makeup tutorial is like looking at a new youtuber 😂
Lmfao at bad decisions. This has been the best makeup tutorial on this channel
Wanted to see the brows that's the most important part
Rihanna you're Stunning,  this look is simple & sweet. I'm definitely trying this.♡
Legit thought she was already wearing lipstick...her natural lip color is gorgeous 😍😍
By far Vogue's best tutorial feature but was that her correct foundation shade...?
She is so cute lol
Rih is the cutest person ever! ♥️
she is so beautiful
Finally someone we care for
So odd to hear/see Rihanna on a person level
Her beauty stuns me ever time 😩💖
So naturally gorgeous her voice is amazing😍😍😍😍😍
Love this but I need Riri to drop new music. Who agrees ?
I love this woman! Like fr
WITH OR WITHOUT MAKEUP SHES STUNNING LOVE YOU RIRI❤️
She's so cute omg 💗
Finally a celebrity who doesnt apply only the slightest amount of concealer, a light bronzer, a lil bit of mascara maybe some highlighter like every other vogue celebrity tutorial😂 ur the real deal rihanna
All i knew about makeup was foundation.😂
What a queen 😍
Sooo fricken gorgeous 😍😍😍☺️
Lmao not gonna lie she gave me a little anxiety with the beauty blender swipes, but she started pouncing. 😂  but she looks stunning as always!!! This is so cute.
Wow, she's actually sounds super knowledgeable about makeup. I liked her products before watching this but wasn't convinced she was involved at all with her line. You can tell she's passionate about it!
Adorei ficou maravilhoso arrasou divando como sempre😍😍😍
Rito: “I start with pink on the lids bcz it says summer sunset love drama BITCHES” 😂😂
love you Rih you’re a queen
I love her so much.
Where is that double chin ??? 🤣🤣🤣
What is the name of that gloss??? OmG😍😍😍
She is so effortlessly beautiful. Like she doesn’t need the makeup at all, but I love that she likes to play with colorful makeup. She just seems like such a fun and light hearted person.
Yassssss queeen is hereeee slayinggggg it like always😍😍😍💦💦💦

BADGALRIRI!!! <3
Wow ❤️
This is the longest I've ever seen Rihanna talk too believe it or not
Society is so crazy. Riri is not fat, and furthermore what is fat in American/Caribbean/Afro American society?  You can never win. You put on Weight and you're considered a hog, you lose weight you must be depressed. The body shaming needs to stop. People should learn how to embrace people at all sizes. Riri you are beautiful and you are more than what they(society/haters) say you are, God bless you 😘
Omg her voice is so soothing
This is the most cutest, funniest, and LEGIT make up tutorial ever! Thumbs up NAVY
I'm a Rihanna stan after this video. PERIOD!
Traducción plissss I don't understand
The best 10 minutes of my life
She is so Average with makeup.. but with it 😍😍😍. . . . HOW!?

Can I be her friend
Is that her natural hair? Or are they extensions?
SHES SO CUTE🤤😍 I CANT😭😻😻

MI AMOR

Am I only one who thinks that the foundation is wrong color?
RİRİ💙
She’s so beautiful with or without makeup 😍
her skin omg..and her skin tone omg.. i want!! and that glow tho ~~ i always admire her skin..while people around me obsessing over pale skin, i'm on the other side like "RIHANNA"
Shes a Queen!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Rihanna looks beautiful without make up
That's my Rihanna
Guys, we don‘t deserve Rihanna in our lives 🙌
I just love hearing her talk
I don't even wear makeup but it's Rihanna sooo
How are her lips so pretty i dont understand  Like theyre pretty and shiny and full like hOW
I wonder if there is any make up masks that is made up with layers of makeup which you could simply put on your face, and you suddenly become bling bling🤪🤪🤪
she’s so cute wtf she needs a youtube channel pls
aşığım bu kadına..karı efsaneeeeee
I think the  foundation is not the best color for her ;D like her head has a different color than the rest of her body
Adorable and a beautiful bombshell 😍❤️
When riri slays all the makeup gurus out there..and she has such a good sense of humour....am amazed.. #queen 👑
That was amazing 😂😂😂
Qween Riri <3 she is the most beautiful singer in the world <3
so cute that you think that people who watch this video are here only cause it's vogue and not because it's YOU :D
Most authentic caleb vogue makeup vid
She’s adorable
Wow i Iove her

NO, THANK YOU VOUGE N RIHANNA
i want Rihanna to make another one ☝🏽❤️
She is gorgeous and so fun to watch! Love her 😘
When she “warmed up” half the concelor on her hand I was like 👀😳 I dont have the money to be wasting my product like that 😂😂❤️
I don't know why she looks so good when her technique is trash...like am I putting too much unnecessary effort or is this just rihanna magic
me @ 5:43 lol
For all the broke bitches: you can use a light oil and body glitter to get the same effect as the last product.
Your tattoos 😍
Não vou botar em inglês não pq aqui nois é BRASIL
The only tutorial that matters💞💞💞
I love thick’ems RiRi girl me to now I love my new body! 😁👍🏾 💄
Wow I thought she already had makeup on when she started the video.
😍😍😍😍😍
Never really seen or heard her just talking or doing a tutorial. I love her stage personality, but this low-key, down to earth vibe is so sweet! Just another reason to adore her. And omgggg she is a goddess! Those light eyes, lips, and glowing skin are to die for
She’s got the most stunning eyes 😩😍😍😍 I’ve never seen someone this beautiful
Ugh what a queen
Fada do meu mundo
Step one: look like Rihanna
MULHER EU TE AMO E TU É DONA DO MEU CU

BEST MAKEUP TUTORIAL EVERR LOVE YOU RIHANNA♥♥♥♥♥
she’s so cute
Before et after...no difference! She's a natural beauty. Henceforth, let it be known that I will be following her makeup technique. The contour didn't show on the forehead though...but who cares?????!!!! I love her!
I could watch this 5000000 times I love her personality so much.
How could u dislike this video 🤦🏽‍♀️😍
*beach please..beach please* get it ? Yeaa 😂😂😂😂 I love her!!!! 😍😍😍
Queen!! 😍😍
"hide that doublechin" Bish where?
Not a fan of makeup, but I can't fight but smile seeing her this happy and joyful 💓💓
What double chin?
What I like about these makeup tutorials is it’s real as much as I love the modern makeup tutorials, I find that for the average make up user they are not real, this is easy and real like your her friend and she’s chatting how she does it ❤️
Gorgeous
yesss queen Rihanna 😍
My black gurl Riri be looking so goooood
It's such a pleasure watching her tutorial 😍 Can't get enough of this. She's so cute and funny. The whole vid was lovely and lively 😉
Luv yaa Riri 💖💖💖
Shushing people is so rude 🙄
First and last make up video I watched in my life. Thats my wife
I can stay all day all night looking at her gorgeousness! This is on repeat yall
‘hide that double chin’ .......GIRLLLLLL WHATTTTT ???
the foundation's color is wrong!
This was by far the best person u guys chose to do these tutorials with 🙌🔥🔥
QUEEN🙌🏼💜
she’s so beautiful
QUEEEENNNNN 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Rihanna, you should take asmr videos
I f***ng love this girl 😍😍😍 she's a goddess
How can you not Love her she is so real
I learned so much, Thanks RiRi!!
she a whole makeup artist as well okaaaaay sis
She is the most stunning human I've ever seen
So beautifull 😍
Omg I love Rihanna. So funny and genuine.
Rihanna is the best it is a queen 👑
I was smiling my face off the entire time I was watching this! She is SOOOOOO cute. :D Love her energy. She gives off good vibes.
The best vogue makeup tutorial
omg can't afford to 'warm my concealer' on my hand like that hahahah
Come back come back come back!! More Rihanna tutorials please although she could just recite her grocery list and I’d still watch 💗
She really is, like, a powerhouse
What is the brand of lipgloss she used?
what lip gloss is that omg
I don't even wear makeup, but doesn't she need a foundation with more red in it?  It ended up working though
either she is wearing a wig or her forehead is too broad! ! smh😑😑
I need that lip glosss 😍😍💋
I think that’s her right foundation shade, she has a red undertone on her body cuz she’s sun burnt I think
OMG RIHANNA!!! YOURE SO BEAUTIFUL 😍 I CANT TAKE IT
She's so goofy and happy 😊 And of course how so beautiful !
Congratulation  ! On Vogue and can wait for your new ALBUM.  My queen 😍🤗💪
THIS is how you should do a simple makeup look, not like them youtubers with contour ten times darker than their skin tone and slathering on that oily crap looking like they've dipped their face in deep fryer. This so refreshing and beautiful. We love you Rihanna, you are STUNNING<3
Rihana is so cute😂😂❤️💕❤️❤️
are her eyes naturally green?
DONA DO MUNDOOOOO
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa rainha
Such a goddess
I love her having meat on her bones. Stunning ❤️
She is without Makeup sooo beautiful

I don't have words and I don't have any edges anymore either coz giiiirl, you just snatched them!
Oh my god i love her
Gotta love her ! 💕
that foundation doesn't look the same color as her skin...
Jajajajaja done baby ajaj🌹
I love Rihanna so much omg
Oh how I wish Rihanna had a YouTube channel!!!!! 😭♥️
WAUUUU, LOVE IT!!
DOING YOUR MAKEUP WITH YOUR (OWN) MAKEUP = LIFE GOALS
I forgot I was watching Rihanna and felt like I was watching a silly make up guru. Like one of those smaller channel ones that are more down to earth.
This made me realise we never really see into RiRi's life. I like this
She’s so cute! Lol love riri
omg this was amazing!! Rihanna is goals!
So cute!!!!
I loveeee yoooouuuu !!! U always look stunning  no matter what!
girl thats yellow
So gorgeous
I love her 😭😩
i assumed she wouldnt know what to do and have someone doing her make up every day
HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE HER
I heard right? At the beginning of the video she said "No, I look fat!"
I love rihanna, but  her foundation shade is wsy too yellow for her
No one gonna point out she showed new Fenty products 😩
I WANT TO KNOW HOW SHE DID HER BROWS!!!!! 😩

Giiiiirl that foundation ain't matching that neck... But she still cute

What an angel. Love her 💕💕💕
yellow face
Omg!!!! We been waiting for this our entire lifeee
THIS GIRL!
OH MY GOD
Shes not RIhanna right here, she is Robyn. And i  LOVE IT <3
God she's so freaking cute 😍
i love this woman
I love how confident she is and secure she is about herself.
OK so, please don't come for my family and everyone I love, but I think the foundation shade is not a very good match for her.. The rest of her technique is very good tho. It's important to taylor contouring to your facial features.
For every person who plans on writing the same comment about the foundation color. Please look at the other comments and responses. They're are way too many people commenting the same question when all you have to do  read.
Sweet 💗
Love you💖
I want to be her friend
She has all the rights to have a make up line of her own than the kardashians /jenner i mean look at her (natural ) beauty!
Nothing but respect for MY president 🙌🏾
She loves to shine, literally and figuratively. Yeah, RiRi!
her foundation is quite off. It is too orange and warm so it also looks too light, but the rest of her body has quite more red and cool tones in it. And it is HER foundation range she is using, so how come she doesn't know how to shade match herself.
my day got better after seeing this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so fresh, so unic, i love her!!!!!!!!
I can’t believe how beautiful this woman is, Can I marry her?
She has her own foundation with 40 different shades and yet, the undertone of her foundation is a total mismatch.
She’s so hot. I can’t.. 😍 that attitude of hers is just.. my my...
Only the real queen
😍😍
her voice is so soothing, i could listen to her all day
I just see calypso everywhere
Rihanna is too cute lol
Literally love her😆❤️😭
She’s so cute omfg
The best Rihanna👑💎💙
hide that double chin ? lol what double chin
I’m not used to seeing her personality but I love it!
YASSSSS MY QUEEEEEENN
She's amazing but that foundation is too light
Wow I replayed this so many times. A QUEEN
ugh she's so beautiful
RiRi I love you so much <3
creme is so yellow. why they cant made a roght colors of this for white and black wemen?
I love you girl! And i know i'm no make up guru but i think your foundation is a bit too yellow for you...
She's so gorgeous she almost looks exactly the same with and without makeup!
Riri taught me to love my huge forehead :)
The way she pronounces "contour" is the cutest thing in the world. Love you Riri 💗
I straight up SCREAMED when I got this notification. Thank you Vogue for blessing us with this beauty!! 💕💕💕

She’s so beautiful
I am by no means a makeup guru, but there's no way that can be the correct foundation. She looks like an oompa loompa.

Nice make up, but your face looks more yellow than your neck. The effect is very unnatural.
Why she using the wrong shade of foundation tho?

She’s soooo cute but that foundation shade did not match her neck and hand?
Was wrong w lookin fat riri
Q U E E N😍♥️
Mesmerizing.  Just. Mesmerizing. 😍
but what about her neck?
*I LOVE HER*
Now i felt like every highlighter is only meant for riri A GLOWING QUEEN
Guys Rih and I have something in common! We both think we look fat.
She is just naturally stunning😍😍😍
1:43 what double chin fam?
Are celebrities ever really alone?
Maybe too yellow?
Omg!😍😍😍😍😍
haha it seems like vogue forced her to do so. she doesn't want her products go viral. just let costumers find them by their owns :v
I always thought Rihanna was beautiful and liked her music. I didn’t know she had this personality. New favorite person lmao
I LOVE YOU RIHANNA <3 SLAY ALL DAY!
i guess this was missing in my life..
I didn't know she was this chill
She’s truly the most prettiest to ever live. Nobody can tell me otherwise.
She's such a cutie 😭😭
She is sooo cuteeee! 😍
she turned into beyonce at the end
I can just imagine someone commenting 'what product is she using to contour and conceal' rn 😂😂
If I tried this I would look like a real joke
I think that the foundation is a bit yollowish for her. The rest of the makeup is a lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So were getting those eye shadows product right
Please put your hair up! So annoying
was that lipgloss she put on the corner of her eye? I always use regular highlight but it never comes out as bright
The love is real. The Queen, finally 😻
I don't think she is too cute
But where is the fat tho?
Wonderful
She’s so adorable wow
Wonferful
"everybody knows concealers are made for eye bags, hung overs, bad decisions."😂
THE LIPGLOSS OMG!
You are so cute and funny! You should do a makeup channel. Love u so much queen

It’s so nice to see Rihanna as herself instead of just on social media, you can see her personality and how cool she is!!!
Also this video cured my depression

Its more than 10 minutes and im amazed of myself. I didnt skip anything
8.43 so cutieeee ❤
RiRi is the kinda girl you fall in love with over and over again everytime she smiles or giggles. It should be illegal to be this cute.
The prettiest ive ever seen😘😍😍
So all the products she didn't show means that we need those Fenty products ASAP! So brows, mascara, bronzer and a BB cream for the summer time would be amazing!
QUEEEEEEN
Her skin is beautiful how???
I love how shes so secure about herself💕 and shes effortlessly herself and open with us. She makes me so happy 💞!

μωρη μπραβοο
I Live for her
Am I the only one who was watching this video smiling the whole time 😍😍😍😍😍😍like yes momma 😭😭😫😫😍😍😍my bald head just became even more bald😂😂😍😍I love you Rihanna ♥️♥️
She is so real  and  so funny 😀 i though  she was wearing make at the start of the video  turns out its natural  beauty #queen
can anybody tell me what’s the shade of her foundation and concealer?!? 😍
Doctor: you have 10 minutes to live Me:
She is so adorable 😘
Wow i never felt so close to rihanna before 😍😍😍😍😍
Ugh how can u not love her
So Cute ~ ~ ~ ~
So cute Riri😍 I like the makeup!
Concealer didn't do the trick for Chris Brown tho
QUEENNNNN
This is way more wholesome & real then most of the other vogue "get ready w/ me's" w/ the models.
A legend
My favourite video ever
I DID enjoy Beautiful.
does anyone knows what product or colour she used at her eyebrows? if it's abh what colour could it be? thanks!
the only makeup tutorial i trust!
Foundation way too light girlll
she puts so much concealer on her hand before using it to ‘warm it up’ imagine being this rich... can’t relate
Rihanna is getting all my coins for her makeup line.
My QUEEN 😍👑
She is stunning !!!!!
How can someone be so beautiful
Somebody knows what product is she using for her corner eyes ? Thanks
How can she be so flawless all the time?!😍
thats is not her color to start off.. like how she did her make up though.. less is more
rihanna is so cute, i love her❤️
Hide that double chin? Woman, whaaaat double chin???? XD
When she said bad decision I knew she would reference that
Soooooo sooooo perfect
I’ve always been a fan of Rihanna’s eyebrows. She always goes lighter, not the instagram thick brows. She doesn’t follow trends
l love how blunt she is about herself LMAOOO
i love her !
Am I the only one bothered by the shade of the foundation? Too orange for her, it doesn't match her neck. She looks stunning either way tho.
UGH QUEEN 😩😻😻🔥
MY LOVE. MY QUEEN.
What did she use in the inner corner of her eyes i need that
She stunning !!🔥💕💕
She's so honest. Luv her..💞
i love rihanna ❤❤❤❤
The most realistic makeup tutorial 😍😍
Love your personality.
10 minutes?! GURL I SPEND TEN MINUTES ON BROWS ALONE looool
You guys, I did not want Rihanna’s makeup tutorial to come to an end because it felt like a short beautiful dream. Looking at her doing her own makeup while smiling and laughing is just so pure and visually pleasing to me. I love that she’s prospering and glowing while doing her thing. 💗✨
Everyone knows concealer is made for                 *eye bags*     *hangovers*               *bad decisions*
I love her, I need that gloss, well maybe not need lemme check the price first
Just made ma day. Love u so gurlRiri kisses
WIFEEEEE
I wish she would begin her own Youtube channel. Cuz I would watch every single video! She is sooo much FUN! 😍😍😍
YAAAAAASSSSS ICON 😍😍😍😍😍💄💋💄
Fun time
She’s so real! That’s why I love her
What highlight is she using?!!!
Riri your fondation is too light for your skin... i even see it in pictures its not like it use to be. It doesn't match it makes me sad
She is completely gorgeous
Are you black.
The best decision I’ve ever made, was deciding to stan this icon back in 2008
She’s so beautiful and charismatic.
Melanin is popping 💁💁💁
Huge Forehead <3 I Love you Riri i really do
I love her energy. I love thats she’s relate-able.  Rihanna = Perfection ❤️😍
My love  !❤
you’re gorgeous rihanna💘
5:33
I didn't know I needed this in my life until I saw it.
I love watching Rihanna do her makeup
Can watch this 100 times she's so perf🔥😩😍
Waiting on FedEx to bring these goodies!!
BEAUTIFUL AS ALWAYS!!!! MY QUEEN <3
10 minutes of my life that was definitely worth it! Always proud of our Caribbean badgyal 😜 #GoRiRi
I think she went off camera for brows and mascara cuz they werent fenty and she couldnt do it without showing the label
NEW MAKEUP IS ON THE WAY 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

She don't even need makeup her skin is gorgeous

I NEED THAT GLOSS IN MY LIFE
Wow 😩😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
Partition for Rihanna to make her own youtube channel wear she can show us more reasons why we don't deserve her.
i wanted to know what eye brow product she used :/
SHE IS LOOOOOOVE
Well....that settles it. If she hadn't been a famous singer she would have been a top beauty blogger/youtuber
I love her she's so pretty 😊
GLOOOOOWING
Hi RiRi
Ame la última parte donde no quería salir el producto de la botella jajaja y ella se pone media incómoda😂😂😂
I miss when youtube make-up tutorials used to be like this instead of overproduced, always dramatic and unnecessarily complicated
watching this while eating high calorie foods with soda xDDD
I love this omg 😍😍😍
HER PERSONALITY IS EVERYTHING !
I love the cun-ture
Girl I LOVE YOU😘

This was the best 10 mins of ma life i swear.....
Leave it to Riri to give us something we didn’t know we needed. Love this!
“No I look fat” MEEEEEEEEEEE
She did those brows though.
Didn’t expect to love this video so much!! ❤️ Should definitely start her on channel!
I don’t even wear makeup and I’m watching this 😂😂😂
Love that she use her own products make them more trustworthy
So... The first 30 seconds it's her makeup free face???!!!!!! OMG HOW???!!!! she's so naturally pretty she doesn't even need the makeup, though her makeup is amazing

Her personality is so nice, like she really seems so down to earth here
Ri Ri is beyond gorgeous! If I put that much make up on I would look like a drag queen but for some reason Rihanna looks natural and beautiful AF no matter how much she uses! How??!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻

Riri looks like a real living barbie Doll
What's her shade in fenty? Anyone plz tell
Riri 💜
i see that new fenty product sis ,,,
That shade is really wrong though
I'M SUPPOSED BE GETTING READY FOR A JOB INTERVIEW
I love riri but this makeup look was horrible
The best makeup tutorial Vogue ever posted
Can she stop being so perfect?
She’s so adorable and funny at the same time. I can’t 😂🦄
Honestly the most naturally beautiful woman on the planet 😍
BUT I WANTED TO SEE YOU DO YOUR BROWS RIH
She is so cute ❤️
We stan a Queen that uses her own makeup line and knows what she doing. 💕 and also throws in a few tips here and there. 😘 unlike Miss Lip Swatcher Cosmetics over there 😏
Her accent 😍
0:05 "no i look fat"     uh no you dont queen
She doesn't need make up tbh she's so perf 😍😍😍
That lipgloss is out of this world gorgeous, or maybe that's just RiRi
This is how makeup is supposed to look she looks so young fresh and beautiful she can pull off anything 😩
73 questions with louis tomlinson please!!!!!
Omg i love your make up!!!!!
Best vogue makeup tutorial. She named everything she uses going down to the shade.  Also she’s even more beautiful in real life😍
I'm can't stop thinking about the meme of men applying makeup/lotion on their shoulder with random things.  I love her puns "beach please." 😆💕
NOOOOO!!!!! your face and neck are 2 different colors!!! Foundation is too light you.😭 still pretty though.
This video is sooo REAL! She actually doesn't mind pointing out her flaws and how she corrects them with makeup. #Realgirlproblems just like us <3
Her foundation is a completely off shade. she has pink undertones not yellow ones and the make up is way to heavy for her. She had a natural glow at the start. All she really needs is some eyebrow makeup, concealer, light foundation and bronzer for some contouring
She's a goddess
I love the way she does makeup! It's exactly how I do mine! I can't stand the makeup tutorials with 50 layers of makeup. It's looks too plastic & cake face. I like when makeup enhances me, not change me :)
That intro is so cute 😘😍🤩🤗🤗😆
Isn`t that the wrong color?
Riri is beautiful.
🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧I love you Riri ❤️❤️❤️
💛👑👑👑💛

Wait...what are those  blush and highlighter duo compacts 5:51??
Ok, I have a question. I don't know much about makeup, but isn't her foundation color off? No disrespect, just wondering.

Nah I don’t understand how one can be so FLAWLESS, a true Queen
Jeffree and shistar wig flew to area 51 gurll!!!
cancel all my paper just to watch this hawt gal
Why is she so amazing 😩❤️
RiRi already has amazing features - she doesn't even need make up. Vogue please do some make-up tutorials with mere mortals that the rest of us can relate to, that would actually be much more helpful and realistic.
You heard it here first folks: this summer it’s a “more is more” kinda vibe 😏
The foundation was too yellow for her skin...it really looked like she put a mask on her face
Omg she is queen
I love that she acc uses her one products
The whole pink vibe is beautiful
*P E R F  👑  T I O N*
god she’s so beautiful
I love her guys 😍😍😍😍
she’s really calming to listen to...like watching bob ross paint😂
She is so sweetheart and down to earth ♥️

the way she pronounces “contour” is EVERYTHING
Rihanna not using primer is a sign that her skin was god given tbh

"Makeup is fun "😒 If you have Money

Most beautiful woman ever
omg everyone out here talking about how her foundation is too yellow— you guys must’ve completely skipped the part where she said she got sunburnt...
where is the fenty music?
I need beyonce to do this type if video too
only thing left is for W magazine to get her to do ASMR
perfect before and more perfect after
what about the neck ?
Bruh! She's not fat😂 i love herrrrr🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 i'm so ready
A 10 min makeup tut by riri? This is way too much for me i dont deserve this and STFU RIHANNA U DONT LOOK FAT

She looks so pretty, and foundation is not yellow actually some dark skinned women wear yellow foundation because other foundation's give grey affect, i also use Yellowish foundation because it suits me and my skin color is same like rihanna, if i ever use any other foundation my face looks to much dark aur too much grey so i use a little yellow foundation
I'm straight. I have an IT test tomorrow. I have not studied. *YET* .I AM WATCHING RIHANNA DO MAKE-UP.
slayyy queeen slayyy
I don't even wear makeup and this video gave me my entire life. <3
I’m a guy and I don’t know why I watch this whole video..   best part is I didn’t skip a thing.
She did a great job !
ok... you know what would make this video better? a Rihanna's song for the background. and I do hope that is the new SavageX lingerie she's wearing 😂 Queen Fenty herself doing make up with Fenty Beauty in Savage x Fenty lingerie and Fenty slides.
such a queen <3
The fact that she wasteed that concealer on her haaands 😯😯

Riri ❤️❤️
how is she so pretty omgg
Obviously she is absolutely gorgeous but when you look at her without makeup she looks like a normal black girl. I know so many black girls who look almost exactly like her or prettier. That’s why I sometimes don’t get the hype around her?
NOW, THIS IS THE CONTENT I SIGNED UP FOR
Riri’s giving me life right now ♡

WTF girl you're face have a deftent  color then you're body.
I love Rihanna🌹🌹🌹
Rihanna is always perfect
y'all always talking about people using the wrong foundation shade when y'all KNOW the struggle. all i saw was that at the end it looked like she had no foundation on. it's called blending and oxydizing.
Rihanna is just too cute xx
she’s the most beautiful woman alive 😭😍
Vibe for summer is more is more. - Rihanna 2018🌸

So hi what about those new products you just casually teased????
Are we not going to talk about the new fenty eyeshadow duos she shows in this video?
Oh really 388 dislikes in 2 hours! The haters, the haters have come out to play!🙄🙄🙄
“When your cheeks look like baby cheeks” 😭 contouring exposed
She's so flawless
Rihanna is so FREAKING PRETTY!!!!!!
Was anyone else worried in the beginning and then breathed when it all came together in the end? I sure was. She bodied this. AND with her own products? Your fave could never. lol.
is it just me who’s so bothered with that black thing in between her lower teeth, like idk if that is cavity or food idk but girl, your friends are fake 😂
QUEEEEEEN 👑

Rihanna....is the queen 👑 😩💕
MADE MY NIGHT
RİHANNAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Dünyanın tek starı
This woman is the complete package !! She's beautiful inside  and out !! Legit queen ❤
It would be so cool to even know her skincare routine
I guess being perfect wasn't enough
Love ❤❤❤😍
honestly? this video just made me think: why does anyone put makeup on ever?! who actually WANTS to have this thick layer of crap on their face and if you touch it, you get it on your hands, clothes etc. it's actually kind of gross. when you think about it.  all we really want is to hide flaws in our skin right? then why not just focus on diet and clearing your skin instead of drowning your skin to the point where it can't breathe?  when you wear makeup everyday, there comes a day when you are so embarrassed by ow natural face, so that you won't even allow people to see you if you aren't covered in all this stuff.
Didnt know she was crazy
I love her so much! Fashion inspo! 😍✨
but this foundation is really not her color
She's way too adorable 😍
Riri ❤💕😍😍😍
My 3rd time watching this haha
I love her but i dont think that her foundation was a great choice..compared to her body it just looks yellow
My goddess.
Shes so relatable i was so surprised watching this! Love her even more after watching this ❤
Ive been watching these Vogue videos for awhile yet never got so excited until they posted RiRi. I LITERALLY SCREAMED YALL
This is aLL I EVER NEEDED
Riri looks so good
Uhhh my love
She's amazingly beautiful.
For once vogue. You 👏🏻did👏🏻good👏🏻. LOVE RIHANNA

QUEEN 👑 She’s soooooo beautiful💕💕💕
Couldnt love her more if i tried
She’s so relatable but at the same time i cant relate to her at all cause you know i can just casually relate to her beauty and money
Best one 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍🔥🔥🔥💜💜💜💜💜😘😍🔥😘💜😍😘😘🔥😍😘😘🔥😍🔥😘🔥🙂🙂😇🔥😇🙂🔥🔥🔥🙂😇😇🔥😇😇🔥😇🔥🔥🔥
If it's not fitting in my purse, I'm changing the purse. Love her.
I love her
More is more 😂❤
"Hide the double Chin" Lmaoo 😂😭
QUEEN 💖💖💖
Love badgal
There so many shades of the fenty beauty foundation and the maker of the brand can't even match her foundation to her body.... weird
Some of the comments she made in this video made me a little uncomfortable. What's with all this "double chin" talk...fat shaming much? And why was she so focused on making her nose look thinner? Is there something wrong with having a larger nose? She's so beautiful, but she needs to realise comments like that can send out a bad message.
i love riri 😍😍😍😍
She’s a natural beauty. Omg i stan a legend
She's so adorable oml
She's too cute to handle.
What an angel omg
"No i look fat" *BISH WER*
Love her
an icon
Queen❤❤❤❤

I luv how she says "contour"
Riri!!
the sound she made when she applied the gloss... same queen ✊🏼😪💞
I loved this. She was so excited playing with the makeup, so cute!! ❤️❤️
Dünyanın en güzel kadını değil de ne
Am I the only one who feels intimidated by cool toned browns?
It's not make up in the minutes if everything is spend up or cut out
aw, i love her
The makeup tutorial is nice, but sis we need a skin care routine because your face in the beginning was glowing 😩. Meanwhile my face over here looking like a bagel 😭
Haha body lava. New bottle. Pump. Pump. Pump. One eternity later. Pump. Her happiness when it was the last air pump. Loooovveee herrrr
Did she even need foundation? And such yellow foundation at that?
Because it says.. summer.... sunset.... love.... drama.......... BITCHES
Well done sis!
i luv u
yoy are so pritte
I thought see was already wearing makeup in the beginning and when she started putting foundation i got shook
Is she using fenty makeup?
is she pregnant? for some odd reason she looks like she is
We dont deserve this
She is cuteeee! Truly enjoying her make up tutorial! Love her personality and make up too😍
She's so cute
Rihana: I look Fat  Me: ~feels like the potato I am becomes fatter~
I like up close and personal RIH like this was soooooooo cute and needed in a sense
She’s makes me so proud to be a black woman in the era of major colorism🤞🏽I love the skin I’m in
rihanna bile fondöten sürerken boynunu es geçiyor ya böyle bi şey olabilir mi...........
So funny 😂😂
She’s gorg! But this foundation is soooo yellow(
She’s so cute it’s killing me
HOW goals RIRI is cannot be said enough..GIrl..You are amazing
I think she's pregnant with her Saudi boyfriend.
She's so adorable. My queen
Anyone knows the nome of the gloss???
does she really use fenty beauty products alone ??or is it for dis video
I’m mad at her for making me wanna go spend money.... 😒😂😂💀
I think the foundation is too yellow for her
MOTHER RIRIRESA PLEASE BLESS US WITH YOUR SKIN CARE ROUTINE

*loveee drama BITCHESSSS I AM CRYING*
I don’t know how many times I had to watch this 😍😍 I love her 😫
What a horrid make up, too bright conclealer emphasizes her bags, contour looks ashy on her, she clearly never wears make up and just did this video for the money.
Who knows what lip gloss she used ? 😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥
The best 10 minutes 28 seconds of my life😘😍
Okay.. I’m ready to buy everything !!
Fenty grows up next
I didn't even realize u were so funny
عسوله
Is anyone else wondering what she used for her eyes and why it hasn't dropped yet??
♡
Honestly,if I looked that beautiful, I wouldn't even THINK of BUYING any makeup
BEAUTIFUL

She looked perfect before she applied anything 😩 girl
I don’t even listen to her music (except for an occasional tbt listen to ‘we ride’) but it’s no question that her beauty is on the next level...dude no matter how fat you were, you would still manage to make it “a look” so plz chill w/ the fphat jokes:0
I really hope to meet u someday
Am I the only one who feels like her foundation is waaaaaay too yellow for her? It just doesn‘t match at all
Rihannaaa😍😍😍😍

I'm pretty sure she smoked a little something before this 😂💕

Her voice y'all😍
what mascara does she use ? 😩 ugh her lashes always look so huge
Your face look yellowish and the contouring stick not matching you it’s too light for you, wtf Rihrih ?!?! Am I the only one to see that non-matching face/body 😫😫😫
my heart stops when i see her
The foundation is too yellow.
I've got a huge forehead too but celebrate it! Nothing wrong with a  high forehead that frames your face
yasss queen🔥
I love when she says contour❤️
She looks like a ghost :(
We all need to have the same level of confidence as Queen Rih 💖😍
Girl your makeup aint match with your skin color
The makeup fell into her skin like spilled milk, I love it
She don’t need make up she’s soo peng  😍😍😍🔥she has a perfect face and a normal forehead

YouTube knows me ... I literally just opened it to watch this and it was the first thing I saw 👌👌 yazz
A Queen ❤️😍
I have only one question: she's Queen or yes?
I swear she's the most gorgeous human being in the planet, like, i've never seen someone with a skin as beautiful as her, seriously, not even a single imperfection. AND THOSE EYES
"Because im black,you know,thats a very special nose" i can relateeeeeeeeeeeee

only thing i can say is a con about this makeup look is that the foundation doesn't make the rest of her body. Since shes tanned she should have switched her shade.

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It just shows Rhianna’s actually a plain Jane & needs a lot of makeup to look ‘naturally’ good. Plus the makeup looked caked on as well, especially the concealer, far too heavy handed!
Badgyal like riri
beautiful riri
She is so close to me :)))
Rihanna ASMR 1:00 😱😱😱😱
Baeeee so pretty!!!
shining bright like a diamond😍
Her skin has a cooler undertone than the fighteningly yellow foundation she chose to use.

😱😫that’s my beautiful bbe🔥❤️❤️❤️💋😊🤗
Rihanna looks like Alicia fox
I LIKE HOW THIS IS THE LONGEST BEAUTY SECRETS VIDEO
On en parle du fond de teint de mauvaise couleur, le stick contour trop clair et qui s’estompe très mal, lanticerne trop clair aussi. Et le highlight trop blanc argenté 😧 bref qu’elle continue à se faire maquiller par son makeup artist car elle seule c’est pas possible
here before 1M
When she got close to the camera, my heart stopped😭😭💗
She sounds like Mariah
A QUEEN!! WE STAN A LIVING LEGEND!!!!
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before -Lady Gaga
Love RiRi ❤️🤗😍
Her and zoe Saldana look like sisters
She's a treasure that must be protected at all times
I"m done! I"m just gonna quit my channel now! it no longer makes sense I continue.  Love you Riri💕💕💕💕  Smh I can't I can not!! Omg!!! No sah jus kill me dead to rahtid how she so cute so?!😩😍
That is such a beautiful bathroom!
This was way better and more alive than any KK tutorial. Go Fenty!
Rihanna is so funny ♡ and beautiful
Oohh she is awesome and beautiful
Lol I just love u
love herrrrrr
Wow!! Nice to see Rihanna in that way
i feel like there is not a single person on planet earth that would look good with that lip except rihanna...
god is a woman
Her way of explaining is way better than my teahers
Seh has the most beautiful perfect skin! Why is she puting on so much foundation? Sometimes I feel like people are just doing make up for no reason, because everybody is doing it.... If you do not need concealer, dont use it, same for make up and everything else. 😅 Just my opinion. ☺️
RIHANNA ME NOTA
This is the first make up tutorial i watch and thats because i like rihanna and i like hearing her talk but those products don’t look good to me. She’s yellow and i don’t see any difference after that “contour”..
I loveee rihannaaaa❤
Yaaaassss, this is exactly what i needed!!! Thank you rihanna! Your highlight is everything! I want to buy all your products now😂😘
Aw have *not* seen this coming
i can watch this forever
Isn't anyone going to mention how she used the wrong shade of foundation?
Her sense of humor is so underrated! She's hilarious 🤣
this was perfect
She doesn’t need any make up! She’s soooooo gorgeous without it! So natural
I WAS THE ENTIRE VIDEO SAYING IN MY HEAD: "YASSSSSSS QUEEN YASSSSSS! 🔥❤
She’s perfect..I’m obsessed
Riri is the best makeup youtuber
She looks beautiful without makeup.💄
She's soooo adorable
TAKE MY ENTIRE CHECK RIRIIII. When the pump was new.... deddddd
Am I the only one who thinks she could have used a darker foundation?
I love her....She is more real and Down to Earth than most youtubers are
She's just too stunning 😍😍😍
Beautiful
No Rihanna!!!! Don't gooooooo!!!!!!! 😢😢
bigforeheadsquad 😂😂😂😂😂
Beautiful!
She seems so fun!

Queen ❤❤❤
She is sooooo cuteeeeee 😩
Some Beauty Youtuber might low-key remake this look
She is snatched the house
She knows what she’s doing. She didn’t highlight her forehead with concealer.
Has Rhet seen this yet? 👀 #goodmythicalmorning
this is gonna be viral
SAME SIS BIG FOREHEAD GANG
You Rihanna is something else, really making me reconsider how I should do my makeup. Makeup for my face not anyone else’s love that concept
We love Rihanna.
She's better at tutorials than some professional make up artists & youtubers lmao
Omg Riri make up video that's 10 mins long?!? Thank God for Vogue!!❤
She's an adorable human being i love her so much ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Rihanna is that big sister everyone wants. She is just so radiant and beautiful! Even her nose, it is a bit bigger than the typical "tall, slim" nose standard and she rocks it. I feel so self-conscious about my nose sometimes, then I look at women like her and it helps on those "feeling fat" days. She just exudes confidence, self-love, fun, and feistiness! Her energy is magnetic! She just makes me so proud to be a Caribbean babe. ❤️❤️ ❤️
the only thing that matters rn.
Shes so cute ohmygod😫
WHEN YOU CLICK THE LIKE BUTTON WHILE THE AD IS PLAYING BEFORE THE VIDEO!!!
She just cremated half of today's " supermodels " ❤🙏
She's so adorable 💕
Rihanna's cupid bow is so powerful
She so beautiful.
She is the cutest!!!!
Concealer hides bad decisions? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Gotta love Riri. She's not doing interviews everywhere so when we do see her esp in a personal setting it's just something to treasure.
THE QUEEN !
Rihanna loves Shimmering
why her own products look yellow on her face?
I didn’t want this to end
MA BOO MA GIRLLL I LOVR YOU YOU SO BEAUTIFULLLLL
Such a cutieee ilyyy riri 💓💓💓
Hassan is very healthy for Rihanna.
I want to marry her
Wow

Rhannia your the best
If sis DONT MAKE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL 😒😍😍😍😍   I mean she has one. BUT I MEAN LIKE THIS🔥
I don't really wear makeup but I feel replenished by this
"Everyone knows concealer is made to hide bad decisions." Our Queen Robyn Rihanna Fenty, 2k18.
Rihanna makes me feel so beautiful, because she is one of the few celebrities that have natural beauty and no surgery, which is rare nowadays. She makes me feel like I’m enough and I don’t need to change myself because she is so stunning. All she does is enhance her features without changing her face into a whole different person, she deserves more credit for being herself. 😍😩
GIRL DOUBLE CHIN WHEREEEEE
BITCHES!
Well you guys THIS is the only make up tutorial that should be relevant on you tube! I love her so much and the intro omg I cracked up she is SO funny 😂💜
Anyone else in a trance just watching her? like how...HOW can someone be so gorgeous?!?!
Fenty Beauty

“Gotta contour this forehead, I gotta big forehead” I can relate sis 😩😭😂

Any comment that slightly goes against her...there’s always a reply that’s defending her to the death 😭😂 but this natural makeup is perfect for her 😭😍
HOLD ON!!!!!!! so it not the fact i was doing my make up wrong its just that Rihanna hadn't made products yet.. I feel better now.. off to spend money i dont have .. thanks rhi rhi!!!!

Love ......❤ Ririi!!
Why color of tone differently color of her skin
Love those colors, Riri! Fun to watch her! Flawless!
QUEEN
The foundation is really yellow but for some reason it works! My fav is the eye look, Rih is just absolutely gorge
Still the love of my life😍
She looks even more  beautiful without makeup...
She is beautiful without make up
Rihanna should start her own youtube channel. She's so cute and best makeup tutorial so far♡
I don’t think it’s the right color for her. She has such good skin, she doesn’t need this much
wait why people tell shes fat ?!?!  like where ?!?!  shes beautiful !!!
i’m surprised that she didn’t use gloss bomb
Fenti has ALL THOSE foundation shades and Rihanna still didn't got matched with one that matches her neck 😔
She doesn’t even need to introduce herself, everyone just knows who she is
Amen been waiting for this she da QUEEN!!!!!!
I hope you enjoy my tutorial cause... I'M DONE XD
Queen Riri ❤️❤️
love you my riri
lmao that foundation is so not ur color.. and that highlight is patchy, all in all I like the look but I wish you toned down the foundaiton just a little, it's too yellow..

This is the best birthday present I could ever ask for
HI MOM
Notice how she uses a contour shade lighter than what most white youtubers use? That's how you contour. Not with a shade 5 times darker than you.
Love her so free and tip amazing 😉 who agrees ?
It’s hard not to love Rihana she’s so lovely 😘😘😘
Loveeeee🖤🖤🖤🖤
THIS IS WHAT I CAME FOR!!!!!

I don’t like that the Queen of matching foundations is NOT matching her own foundation 😞  Still love her tho❤️
When you rich AF     "If it doesn't fit my purse, then I am going to change my purse". Her purse is not cheap you guys

THIS IS GIVING ME LIFE.🌎🌎🌎
I love how casually she just says, "I learned how to contour when I gained weight".. cause gaining weight is nothing to be afraid of... weight comes and goes and it's up to you to keep it under control...
10 minutes of this goddess yaaassssss😭😍👏🙌💓💓
Umm wow what a CUTIE im in love
When she put on the highlighter, I got goosebumps! Makes me want to go visit the fenty beauty counter! Her make up looks great!
I jst love her she so natural n ground to earth type A normal girl doing make-up

Why is she gaining weight? Are you expecting? Like the makeup!

I'm just like Rihanna when it comes to highlighter. I love to go all out with my highlighter. I love highlighter and I put it on so well. I'm glad YouTube gives me a chance to show off my makeup side.
BADGALRIRI SLAYYY QUEEEEN 😍
How is it even possible that she looks so gorgeous without makeup and with makeup. I love how she stated makeup is art. It really is true makeup does look incredible, but you should have some times where you should just let your face breath. Love you Riri.
😍
THANK YOU FOR BLESSING US WITH THIS 🙏🏽
Woowww
THIS WAS EVERYTHING 😻
CLICKED SO FAST I STRAINED MY THUMB
i love you Rihanna!!!

Rihanna, I love your contour tecniche, but your nose is absolutely adorable ❤❤
Queen❤️❤️❤️
she's too beautiful
Oh nooo its my QUEEN!!! 😘😘~ But why the foundation is way too yellow 😂
❤️💕💜💗💖😍
Her beauty has me SHOOK
props to rihanna for staying "real", she remain "untouched" despite the fame & money. She looks exactly the same when she first came out, only now she looks more natural, gorgeous and confident. She learn to love her nose and forehead even with all the haters saying crap about it. Confidence is what truly makes you beautiful, you go girl!
SHE'S SUPERB!!
Doesn't match her neck....looks a bit orange
New Eyeshadow?
I NEVER CLICK FASTER IN MY LIFE WHEN I SAW THIS VIDEO

She’s really cute
"summer, sunset, love, drama .. BITCHES!"
She is so flawless without make up!! Howw
She's so gorgeous her foundation was a bit yellow or is it the lighting?
Were they all fenty products?? The only thing I hate about these videos is that they never mention the products in the description box!!
*GODDESS*
Black people have such beautiful skin and sucks that o wasn’t born with skin like that😕 like I have really dry skin and big pores
I love her!
😂😂😂😂😂😂
"I look kinda cute" nahhh sis you LOOK HELLA CUTE!!
