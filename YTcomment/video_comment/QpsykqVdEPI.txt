Plastic can be recycled, too ;)
The lentils, and rice sound good.  I would prefer spinach over broccoli
How long does it take for the glaucoma to go brown?
You are so beautiful! And I love your hair! My daughter just turned 3 on Friday, and I’m still trying to figure out her hair :( Hopefully one day, soon, I’ll get it.
Can you please make a vegan  dictionary
Made the cauliflower chicken, but bake instead of fried. My girls don't like fried food, they loved it. Thanks for sharing.

I love the music in ur videos! And the recipes r so inspiring!! Love, love, love!!!😍😍
Having Max in the video shows what a great video personality you have. All I mean is that he's so "idc, I'm not trying to impress" and i remember im watching a youtube video of someones life, in contrast you are so inviting that I feel like I'm right there in your kitchen. ❤ yall make a cute pair.
Do they ship to Barbados would love to try the almond butter
I made some and it was great but I used cassava four instead .

Great video! What are your thoughts on the air fryer? Have u tried it?
Fantastic!  I have your book on order.
It seems like you eat A LOT...do you feel stuffed after u eat like us processed food eaters...im actually gathering info and planning to go vegan as im tired of feeling STUFFED and bloated and tired after a meal...i just wondered how you FEEL after eating...thnx 😊
I’m  a new subscriber and new to being vegan and I drink coffee daily. I currently use coconut milk as a creamer but upon watching your video, I saw how  ready your coffee looked. Could you tell me what you used in it?  Thanks for your videos!
I love your videos but you don’t tell all of your ingredients therefore I can’t make the dish. Thanks
I love the music in your videos!
I can’t Wait For Your To Come Out In 2018
You have the dopest music for your videos. Love your channel.
I'm struggling with my new journey...maybe because I need to plan ahead...thanks for sharing
Which brand blender do you use?
Jenné!. Great video!!!!. Please let us know the name of the songs you play in your videos!!!. I am Brazilian and I loved the song in Portuguese you have in this video, but I have no idea who it's from. Thank you!
I am falling in ❤ 😍😍😍 & this is only the 2nd video of yours that I've watched 😲🤤 Honestly, I was so intimidated by this transition to a plant based diet. Ingredients I've never heard of let alone used, will the meals satisfy my insatiable husband & my growing by the second teenage son? But you, you are a blessing to my ENTIRE LIFE! I am confident I will succeed, Thank you so much 😘
I love your videos! Everything you make looks sooooo delicious.
Just taking a moment to say- THANK YOU for your content! I am a youtube vegan recipe JUNKIE and this is by far the most refreshing, inspiring and completely detail-oriented content I've come across in a hot minute.
ha ha I missed my walking break binge watching your video. worth it at lease I walked during my lunch break .
I love guacamole too
I made this  cauliflower dish 3 times so far and everytime it goes over well. I wish I could eat it every day. I made it last night and brought it to work for an office tailgate party and everyone was surprised because they thought it was chicken from how it looked and when I told them they were very surprised. It also satisfied my "fried food" cravings my daughter bought me a halogen oven and I try to use it often and now that I've gone plant based I will be doing a lot of "frying without the oil" when those cravings hit me. I was so happy to see you do his recipe. I love love love your channel and you should be on Food Network or Cooking Channel . I have been tuning in to your youtube channel every day since I found you. Thank you so much you have proved to me that going vegan isn't boring. My sister is my guinea pig for the recipes I've been making and so far she is on the bandwagon (as long as I cook she will more than likely switch over to plant based way of life) I'm doing it for health reasons to try to eliminate the meds and I know it won't be an over night thing but with a positive attitude I'm sure a plant based way of life will put me on the right track . Thanks and blessings
Could you please post the ingredients used for your fried cauliflower or if you already have a video post the link ❤
Immm soooo happy I found your Channel! Thank you for sharing
This is great!! I reuse my plastic bags as trash bags or "shower caps" when I'm deep conditioning under a heated bonnet lol.
How do you get the worms off of your broccoli before roasting
Can you substitute soy milk for almond?
Your channel gets better and better.
The link for thrive market doesn't work
Do you have a recipe for the salad? or how do you roast the veggies?
Love the music and food and you and videos☀️🍉🍉🍀⭐️💪🏻
Please tell me you have a public Spotify playlist
I love your videos ans the colors in there <3 greetings from germany ;)
Am I the only one who didn't know about the cookbook? That's rocking! Congratulations! Definitely will purchase it. You are lovely!
Do they ship to the UK?
The lentil dish, "chicken", pudding, and everything looked delicious and easy to prepare. Can't wait for your book.
New Subbie 💜💜💜💜
You do such a great job on your videos. It's cool to see behind the scenes a little bit.
I wear gloves so I don't get messy my husband laughs at me lol...
Cooking for my vegan wife just turned around now with the discovery of your videos!  She is thrilled.  Hurry cookbook!  Your playlist is awesome...can we find it somewhere?
I truly want to express how grareful I am for videos like these that you make. I've been cutting down on meat & dairy for the last year or so and just a little over  2 weeks ago, I started eating 100% vegan and have been feeling amazing. My family was a bit skeptical at first  but they're warming up to the idea. Thank you so much for all the time and effort you put into making these videos.
Great video as always. I noticed that you play a lot of yoruba songs in your videos. Are you yoruba by any chance?
Omg you are so adorable I love your videos <333 :)
Just love your vids and recipes...  I'm not vegan however trying to eat and adapt a healthy lifestyle and your channel is definitely encouraging!
I agree guac is my joint on anything so good with rice and beans ohhhh my I need to go bye...!
I love watching your channel, I'm learning so much. I'm on a journey to becoming a vegan.
Can you please make a video about some of the music you listen to any good playlist you have I love the music you play in your videos 😍😍😍😍😍💕💕💕💕💕
I didn't grow up with homemade fried foods, whenever I try and fry something like you did with the cauliflower, it splatters everywhere! Is the secret to get a deepish pot like the one you have? Or is it inevitable for splatter to always happen?
omg I just found your channel, how pretty are you please?????? and I love your videos omg so happy I found you
CAN YOU PLEASE do a video or mini tutorial about apple cider vinegar for your hair!! I have been looking into trying it for my horrible dandruff but don't know what to do and how??!
What do you use to keep your guacamole fresh and prevent it from going bad? Really love your videos  and recipes! Everything looks so delicious!!! xxx
New sub here and I gotta say you're helping me fall in love with food all over again.. the way you describe food is beautiful.. how is that even a thing lol.  Girl bless your heart and soul for being such an inspiration ☺💖
You're absolutely gorgeous ❤

Do they ship international?
oh yum! The Hot for Food Cauliflower wings are one of my favourite things I've made recently so excited to see how your version differs :D
Damn girl... Till now, I've only known HotForFood as a great vegan channel, but I discovered you and I'm amazed! You're completely amazing with all what you do!
"I try to eat without too many distractions" Me: *watching this while eating*
Yes, that is all you need in almond butter. Unless you want a smoother texture or you prefer to add a bit of wild honey. There are plenty of healthy oils and sweeteners to add to your almond butter that are fine in moderation. I add a bit of wild local honey to mine to help with allergies, a bit of cinnamon is also nice sometimes. No, you don't "need" these things in your almond butter, but you also don't "need" to fry cauliflower. I think you will find there are plenty of healthy and delicious things that we eat but don't necessarily "need". If you're so worried about what is in your almond butter, make it yourself. It's entirely easy to do and you can control any sweetness or other flavors you might prefer to add.
I love that you toast your bread on a cast iron pan.
I can not wait until your cookbook comes out. 👩🏾‍🍳 I am new to your channel so you have videos on tips for people just starting out? I do meatless mondays I just gave up dairy which was HARD I'm a cheese lover and I work in the wine and spirits industry so There is AlWAYS cheese around 😩
You have really upped the voltage on the artistic quality of your videos, this one was great.  I need to reme,ber to make chia pudding more often=/
You are so adorable! :-)
Do you have or can you do a video of vegan/ environmentally friendly hygiene products such as hair care,deodorant, sunscreen (since summer is rolling around) ? Love your videos I'm attempting to slowly transition to eating more plant based and eventually vegan!
Keep doing what you are doing because I love it! You keep me inspired!
GREAT music!
oooo apple cider vinegar with water on ur scalp?! hmmmmm.
I love the flare that your music choice gives your videos it's so bright and fun <3
You are seriously gorgeous, inside and out!
The music! 😍
thats your husband that photographer?is youtube yourbbusiness?
What kind of flour did you use ?Am gluten free.Also where is resipe for this dish ?Love your Videos ❤✌️
What did you use to lighten up you coffee/drink. I am really struggling with coffee creamer, its my last 5% ( I sneak it at work) :-(
EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOODDDDD!!! Can't wait to try out the chia pudding!
Wow Thrive really? Even with the 25% discount THEY ARE EXPENSIVE!
the music is beautiful❤
Cutting bananas this way on pb and b toast just makes it look a lot fancier!
You are awesome!
ohmygod i've never tried roasting beets!! my life is about to change *.* also, i'm in love with your filming, editing, music and just everything about your videos. So calming to watch <3
your hair omg😍💓
that's actually a wise way to cut up banana on toast!
I just made some chia pudding.  I tasted it straight out of the blender.  It's setting now.  Can it set overnight, although IDK if I'll be able to wait that long?
Why can't you recycle the plastic wrapping in packages?
Love your music choice and videos so so much ! May I ask you where you got your glasses from ? I'm looking for new ones and I love the cat-eye shape 😎
Oh I LOVE this!!! This is class. Love the music! xxx
What's the recipe for the lentils? Looks so good
Wow, love the song so much :) Thanks for your video !
you are literally the besssst! thnk u for this video you beautiful soul!
How cool is the tip with cider vinegar...x
Love this video. I'm not vegan yet, but your videos make me want try.  Also what kind of tripod is that that can hold your camera face down like that with such a long arm? I love it!
Love the video quality.  And the music...so good, and the content of course.
Do you have a recipe for those lentils? They look amazing!
A recipes on those lentils, please!! They look so good!:))
I saw you in the Veg News magazine! Congrats girl! What's in your coffee?
Your hair is thriving 🤷🏾‍♀️just say🤣
I love all your videos, they are so inspiring!! No matter how I feel your videos make me happy again because of the delicous food you cook, the great music and because you seem to have so much fun filming :)
Great video...I agree the music is on point, especially loved Olufeme. I'm checking out Thrive now! Take care, from @mimiveganloca
ur editing is so gooooooddd
I've been meaning to try cauliflower 'chicken' for so long! Yours look absolutely delicious!😍 All your food does, let's be honest!⭐️💕
Where do you find such lively and multicultural music? You should make a video about your music preferences! I have been downloading some of the songs or albums you play because I appreciate them so much.
I LOVE your hair so much
hello! could you talk about your "exercise routine? I have a negative experience with exercise but my body is getting a bit flabby and I would like to be a bit more toned without stressing so much over gym or something... you're very toned and so positive I wish I could do the same hahah  I love your positivity!!
Great video. Your hair looks great! How long have you been growing it for? I've been natural for 3 years, and my hair has length but looks nowhere near as pretty lol!
As usual another beautiful and effortless video! You have truly come into your own with your content and editing! So refreshing Jenne! If I weren't already vegan this would truly make me reconsider lol! You go!
I love love love your videos ! This I don't know.. New Orleans vibes ? It's so relaxing and (i think) a good reflection of your own spirit and personality. Thank's a lot for the inspiration and for this beautiful moment !
Ah, the fried cauliflower looks way too good! I can't wait for that video. And thanks for the fun glimpse into your day. Have a great weekend!
Do the vegan boyfriend tag!!! :-D
Aaaannd...now I'm super hungry because that food looks bomb, yummy
I loved the video...question on Thrive do you a yearly membership or every month...I buy a lot of products at supermarkets, but I've seen their prices are much better...let me know, please
literally a vegan cooking goddess, janae this looks incredible!! thanks for a great video as always <3
how do you make frothy cream for your coffee?? I've tried shaking almond milk in a jar and then microwaving it, but don't feel like I ever have much luck.
The colour teal suits you so well!!! It really complements your natural beauty ♡♡ Really appreciate that your sponsored videos don't feel forced and disingenuous! Always a pleasure watching your videos! 😙
Love your videos and Thank you for the ideas. can you explain yo me why bananas get such a bad rap? I read that for my blood type, that they are really bad. I continue to eat them. I take my cues from God, but I wanted to know your understanding on the matter. Btw. I tried the banana French toast...Amazing. Thank you.
Your aesthetic is so unbelievably pleasing.
Your boyfriend is cute! food looks amazingggg :D
She makes the sponsoring seem so casual, while most people kinda seem like robots lol 🤖
(sigh) Always so good.. love all the great tips and recipes! thanks so much! 💛
Congrats on 100k plus!
You look live Lavender from Matilda! :)
Great music!
I also want to steal all your clothes 😂
Ugh. You're videos are so amazing!! I have watched almost all of them, almost all in one day! I'm obsessed, they are so well edited and your music is always on point!
I am distressed my daughter has developed a peanut and citric acid allergies. I would love to see videos on any recipes that exclude these two items. Funny thing we are not vegan but we are heading towards vegetarian/vegan eating lifestyle. We are grateful for suggestions.
I noticed you reheated the lentils on the stove. do you own a microwave?
i like that you can manage to do sponsored videos with grace. they aren't too obnoxious and dont slap is in the face with the sponsorship. the brand/product is relevant to your videos and fits in seamlessly. with sponsorship becoming so popular nowadays, this is really a rarity
looking forward to your cookbook. 👍😀
Are you using a KitchenAid blender? It's beautiful! It makes my Vitamix look stanky.
I'm so happy that I found your channel ☺️
Your brown rice looked so good...lately my brown rice is getting clumpy.
Hello there. I love thrive. I've been a member for about a year now. The prices are great. And they have everything you need 😊
What is the lentil recipe?
You should *really* try sweet chili guacamole on toast! It's so good! Just add lemon or lime, salt, pepper, chili powder and maple syrup I swear it is SO good! 😍
Pause, why must Vegans add the name of dead animals, fishes,  and birds to our dishes. Can it not be appealing just as Fried Cauliflower? I had "curry brocolli with sauteed mushrooms" not "mushroom beef". You may say it does not matter, but it does when we emulate animal slaughter and we give meateaters the impression that to eat tasty Vegan food, it has to emulate animal products, which is NOT true.
Yum to it all! 👅
Wow how cool! Is it too much to ask how did you guys start collaborating together?😍🙏🏽✨😘😃 Very inspiring love watching your videos!! Xxx
love the behind the scenes footage with your bf :) all the food you ate looked so good!
Hey!!! Thanks again for your videos! I just love them x I made a face mask from one of your previous videos, sooooo good! please more natural beauty vids please!! Xxxxxxx
Do you deep fry in oil?  Everything looks wonderful. Love the music!  Teresa Sparkman.
I love your videos and I absolutely love the music that you play! I truly appreciate so much that you include the names of the songs and artists. You are such a delight!
The music in your video's are epic girl!!!
i love the music!
Great video, love it SweetPotatoSoul! :)
Never clicked so fast for a video!
I love love your videos, that chicken look so yummy!!! Please post the recipe thanks.....
Amazing food as per usual. Also, your eyebrows look AMAZING in this video.
I love how you talk about ways to reduce/reuse plastic on top of how to eat healthy vegan food.  Keep being a great role model! :)
I love thrive market. The music and food were perfect
How do you feel about following "food combining" rules? I noticed you had sweet and acidic fruits at breakfast...promise I'm not judging you or anything, I was just observing and wondered how you felt about the concept! :o  Have you ever given it a try before?  Anyways, thanks for sharing your fantastic looking dishes with us! ♥ Your videos are always so artistic!
that "chicken" looks like the real thing!!! well done
Chia Pudding Yumminess!!
chia pudding is one of my favorite snacks! Great what I eat in a day video!
Yum yum YUM!! What's the name of the 1st song? What spices did you use to dredge your cauliflower?
I can't wait for your book to come out! Yay:)
not to be weird but you should listen to alsarah and the nubatones. i think you'll like their music cause it has similar vibes lol
How about a vegan make up tutorial....?!
in the future you should put "thrive market" in the name of the video so I know when NOT to click on it. thanks
just be careful with these thrive market sponor deals because they will charge you after a month the 59 bucks fee for the year so unless you want to join  be sure to cancel your membership before the 30 days. i didnt realize i was signing up. i thought it was just a 30 day trial, no strings attached. but they did reimburse me and i still may consider them in the future since i live next to whole foods and spend a lot there anyway!
Great video!!! Do you have a cookbook now?
That cauliflower looks BOMB
How leftover was that guacamole?  No matter what I do, any of my leftover guac is always a bit brown. Please share your secrets.
I can't wait for that book to release ❤
Beautiful music 🎶😃 Nice recipes
I love your videos they're beautiful
yes! i've been waiting for another one of these.
I swear I say this every time .. but man I love your videos. The music, the filming style and editing - and you are a ray of sunshine ☀️
