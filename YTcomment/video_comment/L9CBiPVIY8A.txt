Thanks For The Information
Definitely TOO MUCH SALT,
thank you   its lovely
will the okra become slimy when cooked this way?
Why do people use a steak knife for cutting? A serrated knife is used for cutting bread and a smaller one is a steak knife. It doesn't help you to prepare food.
What scent of Old Spice do I add?
this is the real food and so healthy . thank u all the way from Afghanistan.
Good recipe and helpful 10xxx

Hi Lina, I love okra or Bamies. Great dish I will be cooking them your way. I usually fry the meat rather than boiling it. I enjoy experimenting different ways of cooking!!!
