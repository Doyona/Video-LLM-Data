You are right. The tactile feedback from tapping a hole in steel is unique!
I know you love tapping threads, but have you ever considered self-tapping bolts? They are a game changer.
Most will be 30" in diameter... was he wrong,  why then make a >60" wide bed
Tossing that hot piece in the snow had me laughing really hard
-10c is midsummer here!!
Ah yes, the ole snow quench, a long lost canadian hardening secret.
I don't like that it's all only welded. It makes whole build much more expensive...
Great work Matt!.
Hi math.. acchuli where do you live...i am also carpenter please call me.. there
Simply amazing enjoyed watching you build this mill very much ...... Can't wait to see it in action...... Kudos
FWIW. Instead of bolting the log clamping devices in place, 1/4" bar could be welded horizontally  between the cross members on each side and just let the plates rest on them. Would give you the ability to move them anywhere on the mill you need. I know I'm "armchair QB'n" but just a thought for whoever builds one.
I wonder you could have gotten away with building a track system on the ground like a mini rail road. That might have required to pour a concrete slab though.
I'm bingeing this build's videos because of April Wilkerson's build of this too. Well, all of a sudden the blade head has a cover. Didn't see that happen or is it in a further "Part"? Edit: I had another question, but couldn't remember what it was. Now I do. So far, I think you've dropped something in every episode. Is that a regular thing by you? ;-p
Sorry I don't have time for all 287 comments (so far), someone else probably already mentioned it, but in case they haven't, that chainsaw tool is called a "scrench".  (Screwdriver/wrench)
I recommend welding some 'wings' to the bolts used for the side support adjustments.....no wrench to lose, always there.  I also recommend having a few offset or angled sockets for the side supports (the spare/longer pieces) to stow into, again, always there when you need them, off the ground, ready to go when and where you need them.
for anyone that has evrwondered why they are called Lincoln Buzzboxes the 12:15~12:20 area is a really good example.  Just found your videos and I'm loving them so far
Thankyou so much for sharing your knowledge. Your videos have helped me so much.
That cordless drill mfr should use your build as a promotional video for the quality of that drill and it's batteries!Nice work with the black pipe makes sense and not too costly and spare parts are in endless supply too if you find those tees start to slip after a few years you can just swap them out with some new ones for cheap.
You should come to Westvirgina get a job in mines , you have it ,
In further videos you use the sawmill to slab really large logs, as such, my question would be ;  Since the mill is sitting on the ground and not mounted in a stationary manner, have you determined how much twist and flex the mill's bed has when sawing those extra wide and excessively heavy logs.   Great videos, you are a very talented and industrious young man. I admire your personal work ethics and your expressed outlook on life.
thank you Matt. oh there is cutting oil /fluid for drilling or tapping it will prolong the life of the cutting tools. to me the bears got it right hibernate .
You had a 8" beam it could of had saddle clamps underneath with a simple 1' x 1/4 "flat bar for a traveller made and tension angle to hold the log sliding in 'think of the typical 4-8' bar clamp- Easy
Matt, I was thinking;  The right side of your log clamping,  why not use 2X4 wooden studs, cut  to length?   Or, 2X2s ripped from a  2X4.  That way, if the saw blade hits it, won't  damage the blade.  (A friend has a  WoodMizer, and that is how they work.)  Oh, loving this build, again!  steve
Hello Matthew,  If you want to stiffen the log clamps use a reducing Tee.  Then you could use 1 or 1 1/4 for the cross member and the 3/4 for your upright clamp.  Good project.  Take care.  Doug
Matt - I uploaded a video showing my own home brew manual log clamps. They work quite well, so you may want to browse over for a look..
For your vertical supports, you could make the flat grabber on one side and the angled version on the other side, and not have to have 2 sets for different purposes ... just rotate around once you get the log squared.
Looking good what kind of tap handle is that
Great video!  Thanks for leaving all your hardships in the videos.  It keeps a sense of reality and humor.  Glad I'm not the only one who has problems with my projects.   Props for your ingenuity and tenacity.
Simple elegant solutions are the best. That ratcheting tap handle made my heart skip a beat...
-10°C and you're out working in it? We must be soft where I'm from. We feel cold at 5°C/41°F and struggle to get anything done,  although to the other extreme, Christmas day it's forecast to be 36°C/97°F and stay at that till NYE when 40°C/104°F is predicted. Just out of interest, the Pilbara in Western Australia recorded 51°C/124°F at 10am today (21/12/16), now that's ridiculous as well lol.
Awesome!
for using a hammer on the log clamp. have you tried to hit the cross pipe close the the tee fitting with the hammer in order to release it? might be worth a try for an easy way to release the clamp.
god! everytime i see that thing i cant believe how much of a big beast it is! man u did a great job! down to every last detail! cant wait to see it cut! great work! so interesting to watch it come together!
Can't wait to see this thing make some sawdust, Matt! Yer getting close, buddy! :D
You won't feel any cold once you start milling. I and 91000 others can't wait for you to fire up the Beast!
Matt wouldn't it be better if you made the side supports from stainless  steel as well? That way no paint/rust will get on the wood if you plan  on milling some idk... let's say some 4 by 4's (you know when you make  the 1st cut and then you turn the log by 90 degrees, the freshly cut  side would rub against the rusty/painted side supports.
Matt be sure when you drill and your eyes are so close to the action please put safety glasses on a shard got into my eye and scratched my cornea sad I had glasses with no side protection . love the video's keep them coming be safe
Like very much what you did so far Matt. Merry Christmas to you and family
Hey Matt,  add a 6" - 8"  piece of the 1 1/4 pipe over top of the 3/4 spanning section of the log holder on the inside of your locking bracket T...instant slide hammer and no need for any extra tools while running the saw.  One less thing around to loose or cause any problems.
i really appreciate your commitment on this project! I cant wait until its done so you can back to woodworking though!
aww, from the thumbnail, I really thought this was gonna be the first run video........
I love these videos! It's like watching T.V. I usually save your long videos for a time when I can sit down, put up my feet with a drink and enjoy the build.  So awesome, Matt! I am so surprised at how much I am anticipating and looking forward to the completion of this build.  I was secretly hoping for Christmas. I literally can't wait for this thing to be up and running....I don't even know why....it's not like I'm getting sliced logs out of this, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. I guess I'm just rooting for you and your family. I hope everything goes well with no hiccups. Happy Holidays, Matt, to you and yours!
...casually throws the red-hot steel in the snow... Good use of natural resources!
How much work was accomplished last Sunday when it was 24 below zero?
👍👍 can't wait !!!
so heavy! Wau..
Next video cut logs??????
Matt, I see you have a snow-topped log on your mill. Are you gonna make snowboards?
I still cringe every time I see you do metal work on your work bench
Now that you're doing metalwork too, are you going to try and make a branding iron with your logo?
like how you used the snow to cool off that hot metal. lol
Coming along great Matt! Thanks for the vids.
I really like those "pipe clamps" you're using.  One of the great things about those, I think (if I didn't miss anything) is how easy they would be to replace (or upgrade, with the 1" pipe, for example).  I feel like they're an efficient/elegant design, from a layman's perspective.
hey, looking great!  comment for log clamps,. make the low can't clamps permanent,. like 1/2 or 5/8" tall.  and don't take them out.  that's how woodmizer does theirs.
His drill press is the real hero in this build! What a beating its taken
Matt, which metal chop saw are you using and do you like it?  Great job as always!
Haha. I was yelling at the TV. Matt T fitting!. You forgot the T fitting!
Haha. I was yelling at the TV. Matt T fitting!. You forgot the T fitting!
looking really good Matt!
It's coming along great Matt ! I give you a lot of credit for staying with this project. You are in the home stretch and almost ready to cut lumber! Just be careful. As you near completion, you have to stay focused on doing everything safely.
GET SOME GLOVES
Matt I can hardly wait to see that mill in operation. Do you have a furniture build coming any time down the road? I hope mama and #2 are doing well.  God Bless my friend.
For your log clamps.  What if you were to put a short length of pipe over the 3/4" pipe, one on each side of the tee fitting.  You could use them like a slide hammer to quickly set and release the clamps.  A pipe by itself might be too light but you could weld something on to make them heavier and maybe easier to grip.  If this works, you wouldn't need to keep track of any tools in order to clamp the logs.
Matt's next sponsor...  a thermal underwear company  :)     Say how do you plan to get the biggest of your logs onto the mill?   You may have mentioned it in a seperate video.
What happened to your snow
how do you plan on driving the carriage dc motors or ac geardrive ? you ask how far along I am 95% butt stalled because like you working in open and steel is really cold jim
Looking great 👍🏻
You aren't stupid! It's the cold weather. Makes you forgetful.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Nice clamping system! Can't wait to see some sawdust!
15 degrees? You are being dramatic. We both know that come February, that will feel like a balmy day :)
beautiful job on logzilla there. you got some mad skills.
I like the snow tempering.
to release the clamp with hammer, hit the t fitting on the open side of the log side to unbind it. should be easier.
Cool stuff Matt!
A Cremona video to cheer up my day!
Getting to the home stretch!!! Congratulations on the beautiful new family member. Can't wait to see some family videos.
Getting enough sleep with new baby?
Don't get frost bit!  New drill works good!  LOL!  Yep -15 down to -30 degrees. You are a trooper dad!
Nice work on those log holders 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 can't wait to see that bad boy cutting logs and stay warm...
I hope when this is all built that someone does not complain about it and some town bureaucrat does not come by and tell you that you are in violation of some ordinance.
Good quick temporary solution. My mill has a cam lock on each bunk to hold the logs, I don't think it would have been much more work to build this system, and no tools needed for adjustment. Thomas Bandsaw mills built right here in Maine, I don't know if there are any videos on the cam locks but there might be.
Watching you move that log hurt my back... OWWW
to undo your clamps try a slide Hammer. small pipe with a hook on one end with a sliding weight and a stop at one end. normally used for removing axes on cars.
I hope the next video is a cutting video!
Thanks for another great video!  I now get the black pipe log holders.  Watching some of the other sawmills in action has made me aware of the fact that all logs are not straight.  I guess the operator just has to play that by ear and do whatever it takes to hold them until he can make a cant.  This all serves to remind me that there is a lot more to this than meets the eye!
As I watch these final videos , I wonder if you had any idea of the magnitude of this project when you first started? I am so impressed that you were able to do the research that enabled you to master all of the different crafts that it required .
I salute your perseverance in the face of such frigid conditions
At 13:10 you should weld your pipe to your fittings so it doesn't turn on you.
Winter...hot metal is your friend!
That was weird - I thought I saw some wood in the video, but that can't be - I'm watching Cremona's channel 😂
aren't you going to end up milling through the log supports or the clamps?
Awesome ingenuity!!
I think I am getting as antsy as you are to see the first cut!  Had a thought a while ago and never posted it.  I noticed you occasionally have difficulty starting your drill in a center punch divot.  Have you though of staring your holes with a center drill?  I know it is an additional step, but it makes for easier drilling in the long run!
Im only interested in seeing the wood cut
Once you get it complete, are you going to be able to push it through the wood?
That clamp works similar as a hold fast.  Try hitting it on top to loosen.
Matt, you really are inventive and have a great mind for building to the near result but adaptive to work with the future final result! Thanks for sharing the details of building the parts for the manual clamp system! I was amazed at how versatile you built the pieces for strong support! Very interesting and excellent ideas for anyone wanting to build their own!
looking good Matt. Congratulations on the new baby. Sorry I forgot name already. Greg
Another thing the guy had was 2x8s with 2' screws driven thru so that just about 1/4 inch of the point was exposed on one side and the heads out the other.  The points dug into the logs and the heads caught the structure of the bed.  He used these to boost the logs up to get that last cut.
"Handles for convenience"? I'd get a driver adapter for my drill and use a socket.
I hope you will never forget to lower those log supports. Imagine the sparks flying when the saw hits the steel. Scary. Im not sure i like that setup. Not that i would have a better idea...
I hope while the weather was reasonable you got the big job of making the blade whizz around the wheels done before embarking on these little details.  It's gonna get allot colder before it gets warmer up there.
Nice work Matt! You're almost there buddy!
I hired a portable mill once and I recall that it clamped the logs in the middle of the bed from both sides.  The bed was slightly V shaped.  The structure was rectangular, the V made with flat pieces welded to the structure.  I'm thinking that accommodates the taper in the log and makes it easier to roll the logs.  Those clamps could be operated independently to roll the log.  The operator would get the logs close to position with the hydraulics and then used a pike with a hinged hook to get the log in the exact position, clamp it then make the cut.  Ah, don't take the mufflers off to "get more power".  I hired the guy for just one day, about 3 hours and I heard about "that noisy machine" for 2 years.
clever idea on the holddowns!  Do your futureself a favor and throw some anti seize or grease on the pipe threads you want remove later tho... it may gall up on you and ruin a day!
A square tube that fits into another square tube !!  Where pray tell did you get that idea ?
Grabber head thing.
The Cooling Fan in your welder needs some attention a little machine oil should do the trick!
When this sawmill will be in operation for a long time it .Stroite but the result where all qualitatively .You build everything but long
Hey Matt, real pro tip go buy a full 21 ft joint of black iron. it's even cheaper than 10 ft joint although ya won't get that at the big box store.
next is a bobcat or crane to lift those logs to save your back.. now that you have kids to feed.
That laugh at the beginning. Pushing that big gantry back and forth just never gets old, does it...?  Getting so close...
After you use up the logs collected where will you get more?
15 degrees, sounds very refreshing. It when it reaches 0° F that you really should worry. I'm from a Wisconsin farm.   Anyway my thought was, the log holding things that slide along the gas pipe are angled the same direction. Is there any possibility that this would allow the log to lift or roll as opposed to angling them towards each other? One would think the weight of the log would be enough, but how about the last bit of the log?
It is inspiring to watch your attention to detail, patience and work ethic.
I have a suggestion for your side support. Why not paint lines on them for a ruler so you will never cut into them. You could just use a paint pen when its warmer.
No no not stupid, you have a good memory it's just short!
I've got a comment on the mill.....   Before watching this series I didn't even know what a sawmill was but when I started to watch I was not expecting THIS outcome! What you have made is just incredible if you ask me! As I've said before, I didn't really know what to expect but this mill is way better than I would have imagined! Excellent work, just take a step back once in a while and take a look at what you made! It's art!
Awesome work in all weather! :D
What will be cool.is when you check out how thin of a cut that you can take.I "sliced" up some cherry to a quarter inch just to see.Made pizza peels out of some of it.Matt,do Minnesotans eat pizza?
Do you still enjoy tapping holes?
Hi Matt. looking great! I'll bet you are looking forward to getting this thing done so the wood shop can be cleaned of all the metal chips and filings and replaced with wood chips. I know I hate mixing the two. Can't wait to see this baby slab some logs!!!
How do you plan to turn your log until you get your hydraulics done? I have a small push mill that I made my own track system for. I am planning on making some upgrades to the log stops and the clamping similar to what you have done. Turning, especially the large stuff I have seen you mill, is the crux of my workload when working alone. Recently I saw a neat manual turner idea on a Cooks sawmill using a hand winch. Have you designed anything to turn your logs manually yet?
Working in -10 you are a brave guy!
look at the bright side. we had -24f  temp and a -45f windchill yesterday! we can actually stand in a deep freezer just to warm up! waiting for the first cut! thanks matt!
Great progress in bitter conditions, #MassiveMatt !  Well done.  #Woodworking #Sawmill #KeepTheChipsFlying!
nice work.  where did you get that tapping handle....I like it....is that new?
its coming along great Matt can i ask how the saw head is powered along the saw bed your not going to push it are you that would be a lot of work just to cut one log
Almost there man!
How many welding rods have you used so far?   ;)  lol  Making lumber by the weekend!?
I just got an idea for a mill with a conveyor bed, Idk if it's a good idea but it's an idea nevertheless lol
Great progress so far Matt, I am really looking forward to see the first cut!
Nice work... 🤓👍🏼
Working in the cold is just awful! I did it alk day today and now I am about to get into the Sauna : )
you knows you a woodworker when you use a wooden mallet on your metal project :) can't wait to see this thing cut some wood.
Hey Matt. You've gotten really good at hole drilling and tapping threads. I'm calling you TapMaster for today-pretty catchy, no? HoleMaster just doesn't sound right. Get a bolt head driver for your drill to make quick work of securing your logs. Can't wait to see this beast in action.
Great engineering. Just wondering if you are keeping a tally of the costs.
Mat, what are you going to do when you have to man handle a 6 foot Dia. log?
Man that welder fan sounds rough.
Congrats on the new addition to the family.  The journey of a lifetime begins !!!  I know you are young and full of P&V but you really need to take care of your back.  You cannot do anything fun or useful when you have injured you back and it never seems to get better by it's self.  Great job of engineering while you are building.  Not an easy task.
Looking forward to seeing this bad boy do some work!
On your homemade spike bolt things, why did you weld the little plate onto a nipple? Seems like you could weld it right to the coupler and save some money on nipples.  Unrelated, I have some pecan that I rough cut a few months ago and have been drying in my garage, they're still pretty green. The weather is getting cold here but I need the room in my shop. Will the cold weather just slow/stop the drying process, or will the freezing temperatures cause more splitting and cracking from the moisture in the wood freezing and expanding? Thanks!
For the next project a barn to put that mill in. Great job so far!
Can't wait to watch this thing cut into a nice juicy log!!
Hmmm? Here is a thought, if it's that cold there will the frozen moisture in the log make it harder to cut therefore dulling the blade quicker? I mean the logs density has to go up in those temps?
That ratcheting tap handle is brilliant!
You are getting pretty good at wielding with the stick welder.
The skills you have acquired on this project will stand you in good stead for the rest of your life. Merry Christmas to you and your family.
what is the power of the motor?
Man, it's beautiful. *solitary tear runs down cheek* lol
Looks really good, you are getting close. You might consider grinding or filing flat, the corner of the adjustable side posts where your set screw contacts them. That will provide a larger contact patch for the screw to push against. My two cents, eager to see some saw dust fly.
Is that a new tap? I don't remember seeing you use the ratcheting motion. Seems like it would be helpful. Also nice to see your yard without a foot of snow is covering it.
Great update. Congratulations once again and have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year with the new little guy and your family and friends
A wooden mallet with a centering punch?  Really?
You're a trooper Matt!  Looks like a few nice days of weather this week. Hopefully you can take advantage of the brief warm up!
Are you sick of welding?
Cant you fill the pipes with some kind of material (wood, epoxy maybe even sand?) to stiffen them up?
Fin qui hai fatto un lavoro fantastico! Metterai anche una tettoia?
Nice job Matt. Merry Christmas from Annapolis!
im amazed at how many parts to this mill and things in the shop are called thingy....isnt that a pretty good observation....:)
It looks great, but could you just cut a quick dovetail, please?! haha.
It was a few episodes ago, but is the motor all good now? Are you going to build something to protect it from the snow/rain? Or just use the cover.
Where did your snow go!!!!?????? I still have a foot lol
better man then me ...slinging that log around and working out in the cold and snow ,,,great job ....👍🏻
Looking good Matt.  Will you get a cut on it in by Christmas?
just a thought . . .  if you fill the cross pipe with compacted sand, that should make it harder to bend godspeed bro
Will you ad a crane for larger logs?
could you make it a trailer for road transport?
👍👍
when are you going to run it
Looking good, Matt. Just out of curiosity, are you going to be using water to cool the blade during the winter, or are you going to be using Mother Nature? I imagine keeping the water cooling system would be rather challenging if it freezes all he time.
Looks rather "warm" outside. :)
Look'n good, Matt. MAN that's some cold working conditions!
sweet did you get a flamethrower to melt the foot of snow lol😜
Happiness, but nothing about the new kid? LOL you got your hands full man!
