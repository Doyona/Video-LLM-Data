Love the content, the music...not so much. Distracting and loud
I thought this video was about almonds not every other seed
If u ate 1100+ almonds in a day, you can die! FYI, it contains Cyanide.
if you eat all those nuts a day you will get to many nuts
Watching and crunching the nuts
Almond seeds
Pili nuts...❤😋
Doesn't it helps to form crystals or stones in kidney if intake more 🤔 or is it myth
I am waiting for doughnuts to show up😂😂

I tried eating walnuts and almods  it's a lot of nutrients.Almonds taste better it's crunchy and has a anice almondy milk taste to it.Try it guys your body will thank you
Qt opened up by me so I will actually be doing this
I was eating almonds, a Brazil nut, and pecans while watching this video. Now I am going to add chia, flax, and sesame seeds to the my mix.
what if eat all these nuts altogether daily ?
I see lots of comments but no replies from this channel...not very helpful. Nothing is mentioned about eating raw nuts vs. processed/salted/cooked nuts. I'm pretty sure raw nuts have all the benefits mentioned, not so with processed nuts. Also, I've read the almond skin is not healthful, they should be soaked off, but not in boiling water.
I CAN better take them in with smoothie.
Title misleading
Have to try it
Interest ❤
Wow so lovely…Educational channel
Almonds have so many health benefits but expensive
Love this
Ok thanks
One of the reasons why I like almonds is that it's crunchy and tasty,aside from the general nutritional benefits.

Can you do all these in one day? Doesn't seem likely. Luckily I love them all.
I measure my daily consumption of fruit juices and nuts using jigger. One jigger each day because I drink five different juices daily. Then, cashew, pistachio, and almond nuts. Cashew is my favorite. Its butter or milky taste makes me ❤️ it.

Pistachio nuts

I really don't care about reducing body weight, i'm skinny already. I'm only interested in the health benefits, so to reduce the risk of disease.
Almonds and pea nuts
Nothing about almond
So basically eat every nut in the world daily. got it.
Noooooo!!!  Choose different nuts, almonds are ridiculously water-intensive.  80% of the world's almonds come from California and they just can't afford to use the water this way.    Other nuts require a small fraction of the water and are just as healthy.
Happy to listen my Bachelor University name, PMAS Arid Agriculture University <3

Its simple the best diet is protein and fruit in the morning ,then meat and broccoli 🥦 in the afternoon then pasta and meat at the last meal to get carbs for next day energy ,we are not birds but you can ad this in

Almonds are great for many reasons, but they're also inflammatory. So you should eat high Omega iii foods to balance out the omega vi.
This is true have you ever seen a unfit squirrel

All great except Flax.  Unless you want Estrogen.
If we eat 20 almonds every day the almond company will become richer than amazon company 😂😁
Almonds contain cyanide,  but don't worry it is organic cyanide.
Almonds are called superfood for a reason. I remember when I was creating diet plan on Dietarize, they didn't let me leave eggs unselected. Now I realise how important they are in every diet, whether your goal is weight loss or muscle gain. Almodns FTW!!
Been eating for 2 years straight,  nothing happens and I ll not stop eating it
I would get a kidney stone.
What is Chia
Almonds, walnuts, drink protein shake from Costco, organic with green cap, I believe it includes some of the nuts like chia or flax seed u mentioned. I may add cashew to they diet because it contains iron u said, and I believe it may be useful in keeping one’s mind alert throughout from early morning to late night. Is there any product in the market that includes every nut u mentioned?
Cashew
Nothing happened.

What will happen if i eat 20 almonds every day? I will become a nut case.
I eat almonds every day, but 20 is a bit excessive.  They can be slightly toxic, because of hydrocyanic acid in them. That is low levels of cyanide.

Walnuts are better
Alguien español genial

Almond is so expensive I can't afford that's why I want to sell my Kidney so that I can eat that and live healthy life
Why is everyone saying they’re so expensive you can buy a 50 pound bag of them at Walmart for $10
So basically 20 nuts and seeds every day, I'm gonna go nuts.
I too loves having almonds sometimes a lot I dont count how much I eat but ofcourse not more than 25
Can you eat all of the nuts you said
My favorite is pistachios
I thought this was about almonds?
And yet... people swear by drugs and pills  🤷🏾‍♂️ the body will heal itself when you give it the right ingredients.   But I get it though, McDonald’s fries are tasty too 🤣
In this lockdown situation I can't 😀
ALMONDS ARE INCREDIBLY BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT!! DON’T BUY ALMONDS! They use a ridiculous amount of water to grow (about a gallon of water to grow ONE almond) and in California huge almond farms divert water from rivers killing fish and natural life there. Almonds are also a huge contributing factor in bees going extinct, killing billions of bees per year. Bees are brought in to pollinate almond farms, die from pesticides and then they bring MORE BEES to die too! Replace almond milk with oat milk and for God’s sake DON’T BUY ALMONDS!!
Video Content doesn't match the content. Video doesn't talk about 20 Almonds much. Title is wrong.
What is the best way to consume seeds??
Can i eat raw almond everyday instead they are WAY better tasting 😋
Can i eat raw almond everyday instead they are WAY better tasting 😋

Great information! But the hand with the banana in it took me out when the narrator mentioned how the chemical composition in pecans helps to raise testosterone levels in men. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hey can i eat them whenever i want or what i read it's poisonous
I think I ate 60 almonds while watching this video
Almonds in Thailand are somewhat smaller than in other countries. Does the size matter? Should I be eating more because they are smaller?
To much sesame seeds can accumulate in the kidney and cause stones. Be careful
It's banging
Why are making us fool?
Almond is my fav
So... how many do I need a day to eat all this?
HE SAID "DEEZ NUTS" 0:55
god I love nuts
I always have a few from almond walnut peanut and cashew almost every day
I bought some almonds walnuts and 🥜 peanuts and mixed them. It’s exciting to eat.
This video is all over the place.
This could get expensive.
Almonds
Wonder what total calorie count would be if you ate what they recommend of each nut or seed???
Jazak Allah khair more effective      iinformative video advantage of   Almond  and seeds .
I like most if not all mentioned
The title brings you to almonds...yet minutes in it's ad after ad to hear dude talking about walnuts... viewers just roll to another video where people don't expect ad Revenue for telling simple things...
All are my favourites. I like to eat a combination of these nuts every day. Now I know the full benefits of eating these nuts. Thank You
Question about almonds. I think the almonds avaialable here in Thailand ate somewhat smaller than those I was used to in the USA. Does this difference in size make a difference in the therapeutic prooerties of the almonds. How many of these smaller almonds  should I eat daily. Also you recommend snacking  on almonds during the day. I'm not into snacking at all and I put 20 almonds and 5 walnuts in my muesli everyday. Does that make any difference?
How about eating a mix of all this everyday! Even as powder in milk . EVEN BETTER STARTING A COMPANY TO SELL NUT MIX!!!
Once, I was on a diet and only ate nuts. Yeah.... that diet only lasted 1:00.
im addicted in almond cant stop
Who else is eating almond while watching the video?
100 grams almonds a day for weight gain!
LOVE YPU BRIGHT SIDE
Very informative!
A few rubbish! Almonds filled with oxalic acid!   High amounts of a compound called amygdaline glycoside, which after chewing or crushing becomes the cyanide toxin compound  !   20 such almonds to cause poisoning.
I have been eating almonds for years an I dont thing they have done anything special for me.
🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹
amazing
Oxalates
you become a squirrel
If I ate 20 almonds a day I would have a mouthful of shattered teeth
west coast of america is  max producer of almond.. its a CIA information
Every one of it ! I can live just eating all the variations of nuts!
So nobody is mad about the fact that we came here for the almonds and saw non of it
I like almonds
How much for how long
What is better guys raw og soaked almonds?
Waste of time.
So chestnuts should just rot on the tree? None of these named nuts ever achieved mention in the opening line of a Christmas song.  Obviously the cancel culture is at work here.
Music is annoying
20! lol
I presume this applies to almond milk to?
Actually, I ate 47 almonds today! 🙆🏻‍♂️
6:30
Be careful, most seeds are anti-nutrient which literally eats away at other nutrients you get from other food. It's best to have seeds at night before bed in my opinion. Others claim soaking seeds in water prevents the seeds from being anti-nutrient.
Q - What Will Happen to You If You Eat 20 Almonds Every Day? A - I would go into anaphylactic shock and die.
when i did it i became allergic to tree nuts.. DON"T DO IT!
Pecans!
Deez Nuts..
That business about them making you full is a crock, you always eat a ton of nuts, which counters the benefits from the weight you gain.
YOU WILL BE A HAPPY LITTLE SQUIRREL
Almond nuts are bard to bite
this is the first result when u search for almond
Deezzz are my wife’s fave
Love almonds!

Almonds cause inflammation of the intestinal tract. This prevents mineral absorption. Walnuts are better.   Much better.
Anyone know how organic and intensive are nuts farmed and grown and are their any preservatives or additives in harvesting and packing . ? .
I eat all of these on a regular basis.   Still I have Fibromyalgia.   And I'm currently failing.   Any other help would be greatly appreciated
Almond max  1 a day. To many many many omega 6.  Eat instead walnuts best relation omega 3 omega 6.  Do not follow the video advise. They just don't know it.
i eat 15 alomonds a day
Pecan, th0t!
You eat 20 almonds a day, you attack on titan in a way.
Thank You Brightside you guys are one of my best Channel on YT
For all people from India commenting about getting poor by consuming 20 almonds a day, come on.... 20 almonds weigh about 40 grams which is like around 30 Rs. Now don't tell me you can't spend 900 Rs in a month for your personal well being. 20 almonds cost is the same as 2 cigarettes or one plate of Pani poori.
I eat all of them
Thank u . I no need mardan food.enaghp only nuts. ( I have a question human eat anything  nuts for examples same  Cashew+almond+ ... nuts   after all mixing in stomach how its nutrition work.?.)
Yeah and if I drink water, it CAN make me tired but that's not what water is for ....wow this video is bad
Aaaamond *
What to eat, what not to eat.!! My childhood/Teenage years were much better.!!
*If i eat 20 a day, I would actually die or stay in hospital for a month* im alergic

It's hard for me to pick which is my favorite I love eating almost everything on this list it's all pretty good n to know hear its beneficial I'll now consume even more of everything on this list👍👍
Fun thing is that peanuts aren’t actually nuts😂
Almonds...
O:55 seconds look what he says
Thanks
Americans: it’s sooooo expensive Europeans: want to trade walnuts with petrol?
Does eating an Almond Joy bar count?
I eat them every day on my commute to school. I always just take my oatmeal with me to eat in class so I keep a bag in the car with me to eat as my 'pre breakfast'
1pint of almond milk a day does me fine.
Where are you dingos??
Plain yogurt, chopped almonds, flax seeds, and fruit of choice is the best breakfast you can have
Has anyone done this?
Weird title for a video about every nut and seed on planet earth
Seeds and nuts are expensive but if you go to Costco or sams or any wholesale store and buy the big bags they’ll last you for weeks and you save 💰
Almonds are high Calorie foods,so how can they help lose weight ? What knid of double standard are you talking! Some people teach us takig higher Calorie foods (like Almonds) per day can help us gain weight.And you are telling us the opposite . which is true?
Pistachio
I know im not the only one that got here by looking up how to caress an almond
Not surprised some people mention the cost of buying nuts. You know what's more expensive. Health issues later in life. Eat up now and save thousands later in medical bills 😉
*dingo has entered the chat*
Ha, if you eat  all these every day at the quantity he says then you'll be obese 😳
Hit like if you ate almonds today
6:585 Got em
Please do not eat flaxseed seeds if your aim is to increase testosterone.
Like every dayyy she takes all the bags
My mom has diabetes and she eats pumpkin seeds what  Will she get from pumken seed? Flying powers

Badam
Almond always make my face to look fatty, so i don't like it😏🤔
Raw or roasted?? For anywhere and anytime??
I’ll be dead on day 1
too many commercials, will be skipping bright side in the future
All of them are my favourite
Am happy i love peanuts
I lost when you said "All you need is 2 nuts a day"
20 almonds a day gives you kidney stones
Very accurate I am seeing the results from eating Almonds and Cashews
Watching this while i eat chocolate covered almonds
clearly video maker has no experience with dry fruits . DO NOT eat 20 almonds every day ..... just 2-3 are more than enough JUST NO ! dry fruit consumption in that much quantity can disturb your digestion system seriously and those are not easy for kidney and liver if you are not working out regularly.  only peanuts in this list are safe to eat about only 2 ounce max. saying with experience .
What will happen to the environment if everyone does this !? It takes 4.5L of water too make ONE almond !! Look for alternatives
-
How much quantity we eat seeds in a day
Talk about the difficulty in digesting them and nuts in general as a downside?
💟BEAUTIFUL Good Favorite FOOD!‼️💚
Can you eat all of these everyday  Or you’re supposed to choose one
👍
Animal feed.     Low carb diet???????+++
My dad eats like 40 in between snacks right after a meal
Nuts and seed can cause kidney stone if consumed in high amount due to oxelate.
Arthritis
😍
20? Eating too much increases my blood pressure and make my head  heavy
it's insane how simple it is to keep ourselves healthy... we're just not shown the right way and we dont have the sightless idea... but I do though! so at least that's one less that is killing himself with what he eats or doesn't eat for that matter. ...anyway.... blahbling away here
You will go nuts
Yeh. My sinus goes worset by earing almonds daily. I lov them but i cant
Eat eat and eat!
All of them
Almonds are very good for memory retention. Give several to your kids daily and watch them thrive in education!
I am very partial to cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, and flaxseeds.  If I get no other nuts and seeds I will be satisfied.
I like them all
If this is true, how come you don't see squirrels on covers of magazines?
Have been eating all these seeds from several years.. as they say these are good for health.. not sure how much they are helping..
If you eat 20 almonds in a day RUN AWAY IMMEDIATELY AND CALL THE POLICE WHILE SCREAMING FOR HELP!
You can buy a phone for 40k & change it in 2 years. But you think almonds are expensive at 1000/kg ?? Shocking. Why don't you compare the health benefits of both.
I don't know.  You go nuts?  You end every prayer with "almond?"  You become a squirrel?
If you eat 20 almonds a day you'll get cancer... Almonds have some of the highest levels of pesticides...
I'm allergic, so I won't make it to twenty.
Watching this I only got confused actually what to eat!
But if I eat 20 this 5 that 2 that like this it will be tomuch of nuts I guess and ultimately il put on weight I guess 🤔
Phytic acid is so healty
Great video
You become a titan?
You become a person who ate 20 almonds a day.
I love nuts all kinds, sunflower seeds arw a staple in my diet
How to eat almonds directly with skin? or do we need to soak them and remove the skin?
How to eat the seeds, directly? or do we need to roast them? Do we need to wash them before eating as well?
Can you have a balanced diet that includes every seed and nut on this list. Or is it better to only use a select few?
You need to change the name of this video.
Almonds are so expensive, it costs more than 400Rs to buy 250g of almonds in India
You didn't mention macadamia nuts... the king of all nuts...
Why are nuts so expensive but garbage and sugar is cheap!! So wrong.
You gave the dose or amount in a few and miss it in others
Almonds native to Aarons staff then Iran or wherever kills 1000 ?? almond for 1 single drop or quart
would it still be healthy if i decided to eat all of those recommended nuts and seeds every day?
Your a liar I ate a lot and nothing happens to me
I'M Nutz for Nutz
Almonds are the best..taste perfect.
1 ounce = 2 table spoons  that is the dose you recomand per day..  So why do you sometime suggest to eat up to 20 nuts per day??
What will happen if you watch BRIGHT SIDE everyday? . . . . . .  Waste your time by reading these comments

Unfortunately 90% people of India can't afford to eat these nuts...our bloody politicians will never allow poor Indians to reach that stage in life...
20 Almonds Every Day would make me bankrupt and thrown out on to the streets, before a month goes by, for sure!

Y’all,  a big bag of organic almonds is only $10, 20 a day is nothing on my wallet

What happens if you eat them all everyday ?
Almond, pistachio, cashew, peanuts, chia seed
Why are 99% of all those kind of videos just for women that wanna be skinny skeletons?
My church worships them, every hymn ends in Aaaalllmooond, or is it worshipping man with Allllll Mennn🧐
So basically if you eat seeds your DNA mutates you into a squirrel🤣
A university professor of nutritional science spoke about almonds EVERY single lecture. He was obsessed! Studying them further reveals the truth: Almonds really are a SUPER FOOD! And the positives go well beyond mere macronutrient benefits. :)
That colossus titan in that thumbnail 🤙🏼
I bought a 3LBS bag of almond for $16.56 💀 this better be worth it. I need my summer body

Who else watching while eating bunch of almond and kajo lol
Bright side videos are loaded with nonsense. I stopped watching when they mispronounced tocopherol. They don't even know what they are talking about.
I want to try but i don't have enough money to buy almonds :')
Lovely video,and very informative.Thank you!
I love almonds and pistachios, but I keep seeing people say they are expensive. I don’t see an issue paying a little more than 10 dollars for a big bag of each that can can last a long time. You could easily spend that on fast food in a few days which most people do anyways
Ok, I just saw a video that said nuts are bad for you. Because it block the testosterone.. Which one is it? I'm not throwing all my nuts out. >:(
What about Hickory Nuts?

I ate around 40 today and I got a bad stomach ache 😖, I read they can be bad and to many can make you gain weight, lose hunger, and can give you kidney stones 😷
All of these nuts solve all the problems that pharmaceutical drugs are trying to do, without the suicidal thoughts.

Grabs 20 almonds.
i but raw almonds every week .......................very tasty and keep me from eating bad stuff they are my got to Im hungry snack
informative video. However, the title makes it sound like you are going to talk about the benefit of almonds when you talked mostly about other nuts. Perhaps titling it something like the benefits of nuts and seeds will be more accurate.
If your a man,, it will dramatically lower your testosterone
👍👍👍👌
Cholesterol is good, not bad.
Guess i am lucky when i read all the prices of you guys.. I pay like 12 euros for a kilo of almonds and i take like 40/50 grams of them every day

How are cashews healthy?  They taste sooo good!
20 almonds is like 100 calories. It's  fine.
too expensive to eat "healthy". that's why a lot of people go to fastfood places.
So almonds aren’t good if you want to gain weight?
I loved most every nuts they are my daily LOVER snack foods. Thanks God that 👍💗😍
Well I should be superman then...I eat all of these every day.
Razia nuts.

Be carefull not to eat too many Almonds in  one go like 6 or 7, as i broke a tooth like that 1 at a time safer bet!
Quite odd me eating walnuts ends me in vomiting idky but it just does.
Good information thanks for the info very interesting
*Sees thumbnail* TITANS HAVE RETURNED!!!
I’m confused . This video tells us how many/ounces of nuts to eat a day then at the end were told only to eat one ounce of nuts/seeds a day.  Almonds: 20 a day  Brazil nuts: 2 a day  Cashews: 5 a day Hazelnuts: 20 a day  Walnuts: 7 a day  Peanuts: ? Pecans: ? Pistachios: 1.5 to 3 ounces   Chia seeds: 1 ounce a day  Flaxseeds: one tablespoon crushed  Sesame seeds: ? Sunflower seeds: 1 once a day  Pumpkin seeds: ?
macadamia better
A little bit unrealistic to take all this in one day.....     I did the math just to see , and...…. 20 Almonds = 138 cal + 1 tbl Flaxseeds = 30 + 1 ounce Pumpkin seeds = 126 etc.... 1877 calories!!! you cannot have anything else if you are looking to loose weight…
HAVE 1 BOILED EGG EVERY MORNING.CAUSE THE ALMOUNDS HAVE CYONIDE IN THEM..NOT GOOD FOR YOU IN THE LONG RUN.THE BOILED EGG IS VERY GOOD FOR YOU,DONT FORGET EGG'S GIVE LIFE TO CHICKIN'S.READ ABOUT THEM....CYONIDE KILL'S,BUT NUT'S ARE GOOD FOR YOU.MEBY ONCE A WEEK HAVE MABY 10 OF DIFFERENT KIND'S,LIKE MIXED NUT'S IN A CAN.FISH,AND RASIN'S,AND CARROT'S ARE ALSO GOOD FOR YOU WITH A LITTLE GARLIC,WHEAT,BANANAS,PEANUT BUTTER,AND BOTTLED WATER,JUST A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING IS GOOD FOR YOU.LIKE GRAP'S,LIL HONEY SOME GREEN TEA,COCANUT,JUST READ ABOUT FOOD,ETC.IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT,DONT TAKE ANYBODY'S WORD FOR 100%....
Title: What will happen if you eat 20 almonds every day. Video: Nuts are good for you what is this channel playing at
Awesome... Information...
Lol trying to gain weight, this probably won't help lol
Less than 2 minutes of this video is about almonds? misleading video...
I eat litterally like 100 walnuts A Day because im addicted to Them XD im basically A walnutaholic
FLAX SEEDS ARE BETTER FOR INDIANS.
So many reasons not to eat almonds, other nuts, seeds, or peanut butter...They're so high in phytates and oxalates that you don't absorb the minerals, like zinc, iron, manganese and calcium. Also, we change only a minuscule amount of the very unstable omega fats, which are extremely high in these "foods", into usable fats, so they're just inflammatory.  Plus, we need the usable omega fats DHA and arachidonic acid for mental health, but plant omega fats displace our precious brain fats, causing many proplems-there's a reason they call crazy people "nuts"! Also, nuts, seeds and peanut butter are incredibly high in these fats, so they displace the good fats in our diet. People used to eat nuts in late fall to fatten up for the winter, just like squirrels do. However, squirrels, nature's natural nut and seed eaters, have the sense to ferment them first, in their cheeks before eating them, which makes them more digestible. In addition, many nuts are high in salicylates, the plant's natural pesticide, and many people are sensitive to salicylates but don't know it (they may get migraines, brain fog, hyperactivity, GERD, constipation, bloating, dry skin, fatigue, and/or nasal congestion). Nuts and seeds have a topsy-turvy amino acid profile, being very high in the non-essential amino acid arginine, and very low in the essential amino acid lysine. Arginine competes with lysine for absorption, and feeds viral activity and makes tumors grow (because it is the source for inflammatory nitric oxide). Most studies that show health effects from eating nuts, seeds and peanut butter are funded by the nut industry. After 35 years of eating this stuff, as a vegetarian, I went back to only traditional, ancestral foods, and finally feel good, so I highly recommend it!
20 is much better try 7 everyday.
Great presentation. A good reminder for my health.
By eating so many different kinds of nuts I'm not going to have anymore appetite for my steak .
Different nuts work in different ways so be sure you figure out which do what? Men vs women as some nuts lower testosterone in men and some help increase.
Dude i eat far more than 20 almonds a day. Probably not a good thing but it’s so hard to put them down because I mix my plain ones with cocoa roasted
way too much omega 6, and anti nutrients. rather spend my money on actual healthy MEALS. no time for snacks.
U almost forgot about liver wat about it
Almonds are my go-to snack. I'm diabetic and these are filling for me, without messing up my blood glucose.
I wanna eat all these seeds but in doubt how to moderately eat them.
I love them, thanks!
he said “deez nuts”

Q- why did the cow cross the road                                                                                                        To get to the movies 😂 also like if you got the joke
I can only have peanuts 😒
People that say Almonds are expensive are happy enough to spend money on fizzy drinks,chocolate,cookies etc.People will always find an excuse not to do something,even if they are aware of the benefits.
Favorites: almonds, pecan, walnuts. Like the rest too.
So basically eat a bag of nuts a day to keep them diseases away? Doubt you'll have any place in your stomach left for anything else by the end of the day.
I do eat well over that daily
This is all based on non scientific theories.
I love nuts but my favorite is almonds , Cashews and  Brazil nuts.. Thanks for the info..
Pistachio loved it
Cashews.  I can't get enough of them!
in my country you will run out of money if you eat almonds everyday 😂😂😂
I. Iove you. Bright side

Who else watching this while eating almonds
I eat nothing but grounded beef
At one (1) ounce of EACH seed mentioned PER day would equal how many calories ?????   No mention of sunflower seeds !!
Folks, it's fine to eat any ONE of these nuts the recommended amount per day, but dont take (for example), 20 almonds AND 7 walnuts AND 2 handfuls of pistachios AND..... per day.  you're just asking for trouble.
what if i ate 21 almonds ?
Cianide is made from almonds. Don't eat too many.

Is it safe to assume that this video refers to raw nuts and seeds? I'm pretty sure  heat destroys some, if not most of their beneficial properties
I work for baskin robins and eat almonds everyday,and i lost some few pounds
TERRIBLE MUSIC  PLEASE ! TURN !! THAT !!! OFF !!!!
I think that every different type of seeds and nuts have the different benefits and I will try all of them!!
Flax seeds increase severe prostate cancer. You need to do better research for your videos.
I choose snacking liquid peanuts
Should OR Can these be taken eaten in raw form?
Well it’s absolutely right  !! I’m taking those nuts combination with the carrots tomatoes oaths to blended as the breakfast since 20 years ago the results it’s Amazing ! Oh ya  ! It’s much younger looking at least a decades to compares with my classmates ! Come on brothers sisters !
I'm eating almonds & cashews while watching these benefits 😁
You forgot to mention that almonds contain zero omega 3  and that makes it pro-inflammatory.
My personal favorite is cashew(kaju) and raisin (izyum). I love it
alomond  and flax seeds decreases Testosterone........... Dark Side
They are cheap in Middle East and Asia in eu and North America food distributors take us for a big ride and enriching themselves sad fentanyl is cheaper!!!!! Disgusting
I started laughing at 00:56 and then I couldn´t stop so I had to rewatch the video from 01:00 so it wouldn't happen again XD
I eat a ton of almonds and all I see is I am tired must be the tryptophan...
Nothing!!!!!
5 a day is enough your body .... can’t asborb anymore
good info.
I soak my raw almonds in hot water with raw oats and cranberries or raisins...YUM. I spit out the almond husks as the shed from the almonds from soaking in hot water....oh well...spitting is just another activity to burn calories
Sometimes I feel like a nut.. #almondjoy
is  there  any supplier of nuts who combine an  assortment of different nuts in one package ?
I eat this stuff  everday, esp. seeds like Pistachios #nutfreak
Hey I love almonds my self but I feel kind of sad my favorite is not in the list I`m talking about the chestnut who really taste great but it is very hard to find someone to sell it even here and it grows here
Edgar Cayce said eating two or three almonds a day will keep the cancer away.
A 1 minute introduction, 2 minutes speaking about almonds, the rest wasn't about almonds.
all
Just remember folks these are called "DRY FRUITS" for a reason, so if you are warm/thick blooded person living in hotter country(near equador/middle east) don't eat as much as video is telling in summers.
I think this guy is nuts

cashew 123456789089 and more errrrrrrr
Who knew it takes over 10 minutes to explain that eating almonds daily make you healthy :0:0:0
I watched this eating a bag full of almonds, pistachios and sunflower seeds
cashew my favryt
Pistachios
There was literally 50 seconds of this video specifically talking about the health effects of almonds, which is what the title lead me to believe this video was about.  (0:47 - 1:37)  The rest was simply filler, unrelated information about other nuts, and requests for views and subscriptions until this pushed past the 10 minute mark.  I don't often hit the Dislike button on videos, but on such a clear case of click bait, misdirection, and exploitation of youtube advertising algorithms, I am going to dislike this, and I encourage others to as well.
loved this video
So men should eat big nuts to save their own nuts. 😅
I eat almonds every day 👌🏽
I have nut allergy!
just reading these comments, i think its strange how people think eating healthy is expensive. you dont have to completely stuff yourself of empty carbs. the video literally says seeds and nuts are a great substitute to feeling full. so just eat a good handful of nuts and seeds instead of a >$5 pizza that would probably hit you back with a medical bill later.
First thing I thought about when I saw this was Happy Tree Friends
20 almonds is a lot of calories.
Cashew almond &  peanuts.
Mouth watering while watching
Been eating almonds most recently once in awhile.  Interesting info on the other types of nuts
Id get indigestion
Almonds and cashews
Cashew nuts , Almonds, peanuts,  and walnuts.
Post needs to put all these in Honey Bunches of Oats.
That's great,I take walnuts daily
I love chia seeds👌🏻🤤
Walnuts and almonds are my weakness I love these nuts.
Bright side u make awesome work but please make some videos for viewers more okay for kid please I don’t want to be scared about ur vids sometimes
I ate almonds after watching this
my favorite nuts are pistachios
I like a lot of nuts do I really have to choose?
Also, raw and unsalted is the better way to eat nuts.
Most almonds come from the Central Valley in California. They have to import bees to pollinate.As a vegan l eat loads of nuts including all those nuts and seeds mentioned. It forgot to say that pumpkin seeds contain useful amounts of zinc. Also brazils are the most naturally radio active food found. I eat loads so probably glow in the dark! Pecans are very expensive here in the UK. Didn’t mention macadamias, perhaps my favorite and grown in Hawaii and Australia.
.....  Oops!!! They only not have for four of twelve nuts/seeds!!!
...... How many are “we” supposed to take, after flake seeds??? ..... All the seeds, after flake seeds??
I eat almonds daily. Love all nuts and seeds. I’m going to make a bag of all these together and have just one handful a day. Then I get the benefits of all!
You tell us to not eat more than one ounce of each of these nuts a day and yet you also tell us to eat 2ounces of pistachios...  so which is it.  Would eating all these every day be recommended or would there be some avoidable perhaps even best to be avoided duplication?
What cause of my dental situation when I see something about almonds though I know they are good for you I just passed by that just too hard and I can't handle them yes I am suffering from Dental neglect you reap what you sow.
flax is known to lower T be careful guys
Very helpfull information
1:30 *cries and eats lemon pound cake*
Nuts in your mouth, not on your chin.
I just loved this!
Welcome to your new life as a squirrel.
You should not snack between meals. This keeps the body in constant digesting mode. Digesting is the hardest job the body does and the most wearing and aging on the body. . Much better to tack the nuts,  or any snack onto a meal. Fasting is one of the healthiest things one can do. Let the body go into fasting mode between meals. You won't be sorry. Also the fewer the meals, the longer the fasting, the healthier for the body.
What are the numbers mason.  How many pecans a day do we need to eat.  the numbers mason
At 0:55 THEEEESE NUTS!!
Cashews

I love all of them! /can I eat all of the nuts at they same time? :)
I'm eating almonds right now
I eat all kinds of nuts, they are expensive, I value my life. I would rather spend on wholesome food than on things.
Oooooo!  I eat 10 almonds every morning. 😋
Am a ground nuts fan i eat them alot i real wanna know the impact of eating too much and daily coz i cannot pass a day without them especial  uncoocked. Some baody help
If you eat a lot of nuts, be sure to followup with a laxative. I used to eat peanuts until I broke a crown and the dental bill was $600. Now my nut consumption is in peanut butter.
Eat daily you won't forget.

Thanks for a informative video but plz also use the metric system so most people around the globe can understand
Apricot seeds are my choice.
and did you know, bitter almonds were banned in the US in 1995 given they are effective in fighting cancer?
But don't these nuts increase body temperature ?
I ❤ peanuts
Cute animation, too.
Brazil nuts are one of the few easy sources of selenium if you don't eat meat.
No white 🍞 bread! Unless it's sourdough but not too often.
Thanks for the reminder! Add seeds to your green shakes!
But I love McDonald’s nuggets 😘😘

Very useful tips  Thank you for sharing this post..
Its probably extremely hard to eat all these types of nuts in the amounts recommended. I'd probably get them all, put them in a large bowl and snack on them.
The narrator sound like sigint from Metal Gear Solid 3
Peanuts aren't nuts
*I love how they put seasame seeds on burger buns and ironically burgers happen to cause:* -Increased blood pressure. -Causes strokes. -Causes Heart attacks. -Blood clots. Complete opposite of what seasame seeds are supposed to do.
Whoa I’m eating almonds while watching this
FYI @Bright Side Almonds both sweet and bitter almonds have trace amounts of cyanide, higher than the recommended dosage to be considered lethal...You all can look up the research papers done on the different kinds on almonds. So almonds are actually very lethal, the cyanide hinders cell respiration aka hypoxia. Learnt this thanks to Dr. Sebi. And I read for myself. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3793392/
I love them all.
I'll eat mine covered in chocolate! Or ice cream!
Thanks for the video. Almonds have one more benefit. It sharpens your memory. Increases your grasping power.  Soak almonds in the water in the night and have those in the morning. This way one can get more benefits. If you don't like the skin then peel it off and then consume them. It's always recommended though to have it with the skin.
I hear Linn LM-1 drum machine samples in the background music. Rimshot/sidestick sound (pitched down) and claps. Very recognisable sounds in early 80s New Wave/Synthpop music. Especially in Prince's music!
I remember eating some of these!!! I never knew that they were healthy!!
the way he says ‘pecans’ is triggering
So if i eat 20 almonds and 1 tablespoon of all the other seeds and nuts will i be a superman?

Love lightly salted roasted almonds! I buy a big bag from my local Trader Joe's!
This is an expensive diet lol

Don't almonds require a substantial amount of water to grow and was one of the major problems California was facing during the drought?

I did that. I developed a sensitivity to almonds and my throat almost closed up. Now I can't eat them.
What about COCO nuts (get the bad pun)!
I love all kinds of nuts and seeds. All except for pistachios. That is the only kind of nut that I hate. I am trying to lose weight. So even knowing that about what pistachios can do. I am still not going to eat them. I can't eat something that I hate the taste of them.

Know for sure the positive changes will happen to you if you solve at least 3 brain-teasing riddles per day :) Here is a one for you:  Helen was in her hotel room when suddenly there’s a knock on the door.  She opened the door to see a stranger. A stranger said, “I’m sorry, I have mistaken the floors, I thought this was my room.” He then went down the corridor.   The woman went back and phoned security. Why was Helen so suspicious?
Hey 👋 I Going 🥜 nuts 🥜
I remember back in Christmas last year my uncle gave me a lots of Almond Chocolate as our Christmas gift. He knows that I love them very much. And until now, we still have plenty of jars of them. And they're enough until the next Christmas. I ate it 15-20 pieces a day. And since that, I feel my body always full of energy.😄😄
Now I want to get all these nuts at the store all at once. It's driving me nuts.
Awesome video! 😎
Thanks for sharing I found this video  so interesting

What would happen to the body and health if one consume just 1 ounce or 2-10 of all the mentioned seeds and nuts everyday for 1 week; and drink only water and consume nothing else (like carbs, meat, fruits)?
I eat hundreds of them a day.
Boi I eat almonds every day and other nuts as well and I'm still 104 lbs
Why am I on this video??? *IM ALLERGIC TO NUTS XD*
1 question: do I need to soak  few of them overnight or eat just like normal?
Could you throw all of these into a blender and put them in a shake?
I didn’t understand
Are walnuts like almonds ? If they are I would eat both of them because I love ALMONDS SOOO GOOD  At school my friend gives me almonds because he doesn’t like them And it is better because I’m on summer and don’t have to eat from the school
I love almonds and pistachios
What will happen if I consumed double the portion of all the listed seeds and nuts

Pumpkin seed oil in the supplement I take because with menopause and my lupus my hair seems to fall out but when I take this it truly helps.

Your skin comes off, according to the thumbnail.

This video is " pretty cool huh".
How many almonds do you eat everyday
Almonds break my fillings 😢
That is absolutely nuts..
Everyone today it seems is promoting diversity and multiculturalism. But did you ever notice that these things are being promoted in ALL White countries and ONLY in White countries? Did you ever wonder why that was the case? Diversity and multiculturalism, if allowed to continue, will turn every White country on earth into a non-White country within a few decades. There will still be plenty of Black countries and Asian countries. Under international law, this is genocide. Diversity and multiculturalism are codewords for White genocide. Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.
Almonds and I mostly eat them all the time!!! 😖
Walnuts and almonds my favourite
Nuts and seeds are an especially important part of a Whole Food Plant Based vegan diet.  Where do I get my protein?  Nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains.  Quinoa is actually a type of seed, even though we cook it like a grain.
Would it be safe to crush up all of the desired nuts together and then pour it over some yogurt to eat them all in one shot?? 🤔
Oh gosh !
Be sure to grind the flax in a blender to get the benefits.  Keep the unused ground flax in the refrigerator or freezer.  You can buy ground flax, but it might be stale already.
love the background music sounds like something prince make back in the day.
I'm allergic to almost, and other tree nuts
What about a nut only diet like a little bit of all of them mixed up as a moderate meal size(3 times a day)
I lobe almonds

Almounds contain trace amounts of cyanide also eating to meny in one day can lead to constipation, bloating, overdose on vitamin e, and increase toxic levels in the body

Allergic to almonds
I love almonds and cashew nuts.....any amount and at any time...
If I eat 20 almonds/day, I will probably be healthy but I will die of poverty so whats the point!
You should mention that sweet almonds that we Harvest are usually fine while bitter almonds or wild almonds can have cyanide in them and eating them in large quantities can actually be detrimental to your health
I love almonds i am every day 5 almonds eating  No 20 almonds
Almonds is a great low carb snack. This is great for diabetics since it barely raises the blood sugar
Is it healthy to eat chocolates mixed with nuts?
6:12 he said deez nutz!!!!!!! 😆
