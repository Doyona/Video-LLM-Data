It’s beautiful!
Very delicious 😋
I LOVE  YOU ALOT
When I klick on the link of the recipe there comes only the message: "File not found". Where can I finde the recipe for this cake?
Hello !! How can I achieve this effect in a round  normal cake ? With no hole in the center . Thank you
The link to go to the printable recipe does not work.
I'm actually making this cake tomorrow for mother's day, only thing for the yellow cake I'm gonna use box cake it's faster and easier.

Amazing
beautiful. im totally making this one!!
Amazing recipe
I am having a problem! I'm trying to get to your recipe/blog and my computer keeps giving me an error message saying it is not a safe web page. It won't let me access! Is there another way to get this recipe? (I hope!)
Can I do the same with round cake?
Your hidden heart cake fully matched with one another channel,And you made 2 Years back from her.........
But seriously, screw Nestle
This is a great idea to come out, I’m thinking about doing this cake
Sangat kreativ
All the gays taking notes (it's me I'm the gays)
Your website gives a warning and can’t get on when trying to access from Canada.
Where are the ingredients quantity?
Wow
Ya callate me mareas de tanto que hablas
wouldn't starting by thoroughly creaming the sugar and butter by themselves and then popping the eggs in one at a time make the vanilla sponge better?
this looks absolutely delicious! i would make it, but, one, i’m lazy and two, i don’t have money to go buy all these things for it soooo i’ll just sit and watch the vid :)
the gays are here
Yay I made it, its so cute!
u give such good tips. thank you fro sharing
LOVE your cake yummy.. Pls put some grams to cups too.. Thank you.
This is so beautiful cake
The ol' tapa tapa!
This may be the 5th time i am watching this video.. I love the way you explain.  I dont care if its a promotion or ad for any product.  I loved the  pleasant facial expression on your face when you talk about every ingredient and its beauty.  Your recipe is so beautiful and so are you!!
Cant wait to try this .thanx ❤
Box of cake mix is good for me to start with
Elle parle trop cette fille ! Ça fait mal au crâne ! 😂
Sólo estoy aquí por maire wink xD
So much of work
Nice video but too much talking.
Tasty 😋 and yummy
Mmm tasty and yummy and delicious
I tried it and it was great! I loved how the ganash in the chocolate cake batter made it so moist!! It was a hit and everyone loved it and was amazed on how I did it!! Although for me there was way too much vanilla cake I had so much leftover!! This might be because my bunt tin was small but I would suggest do only one batch of the vanilla cake recipe not two. But it wasn’t that bad having so much cake because there was a lot to snack on lol!! Thanks again for the yummy and intriguing cake recipe!!!
Asi que así es cómo debió quedar....
What are the measurements in English please?
I must make this! Only with a white vanilla cake!!
I made this and it was amazing. The taste was really good. I even got a heart when I cut my cake 😍
Hi! Is the written recipe still available? I cannot find it :-(. I clicked the given link but the page is empty :-(
Hi! Is the written recipe still available? I cannot find it :-(. I clicked the given link but the page is empty :-(
It is so yummy😋😋😋
Vow !!!! Heart cake 💓💕💖❤️💞💗💝...
What should I use instead of eggs?
good  idea !
Thank you x
🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈,👍👍👍👍👍
Beautiful cake as u thank u so much
I wanna make rainbow cake with which u cut inside have m&m or strawberry or chocolate foudant fall off
I'm finding some skill to learn as I'm wanna do for my younger daughter birthday cake
Gawwwd, this woman talks too much.
Love that!
Is it ok to use the vanilla cake measurement given in the description box ? As i cannot double since my oven and my baking tray is small !
Wouldn't the hearts be all dry compared to the rest of the cake? I mean if you bake them first and then bake them again for another 30 mins... ? At the end of the day the taste of the cake is more important than the look to me!
Cake is nice but...RELAX!
Can I make a simple chocolate cake for this ?
My  febrate  desert  I always v
seriously guys..you are all worried about her saying love hearts then what she baked...get over it.
Oh my goodness!😲 finally someone put both of the measuring methods in the written recipe under the video😍 I love your video, I love that you make everything so easy to understand but most of all like I said thank you for putting the measurements in both metric and American measurements😍😘 thank you thank you thank you ... L🤣💕
Great thank you for the video
I didn't get a perfect heart shape
Blessed Good Morning won't double baking it make it dry?
This is JoJo's mom I bet.
Why is it too much to ask if you are going to publish in the US, could you please be polite enough to do it so we could understand---in cups, etc. Who does 2.2 oz eggs? Or 100 ml cream?
Can someone please tell me what the vanilla cake measurements are in  cups?????????? PLSSSS
Alguien habla Español ?
*Ahhh cookies*
Can you give measurements in cups and spoons?
أكو عرب بالطيارة😂😂 حد يفهمني شو بتحكي😂
I'm trying to figure out if her accent is British or Southern.  Maybe South British?  LOL
Wow sister its amazing but your  ingredients  are  very difficult  to find so now if you   make  any items the ingredients  are easy  to find
It looks way yumier than it actually tastes
I tried to follow your video and make my own, except I didn't have any skittles so I used paper clips, and I didn't have icing, so I used glue.
It looks wonderful, but why didn't she cut the piece on the part in front of her? I also wonder how chocolate syrup topping can cut the sweetness of the cake. This would make a great cake for all kinds of occasions, including coming out and Pride occasions. I hear the ones who think they would get the slice with no heart, I probably would too!
stop sponsoring nestlé, it's just wrong
zz z  Z z zz. Z z z X z.      Z  z zz.   Z.  Z z. Z z.  Xzx
Wow. Thats a beauty of a cake
She kind of reminds me of JoJo Siwa....
Buenos días  De pronto alguna de ustedes hablan ingles y español q x favor tradusca la receta al español   muchas gracias
No offense to your skills - I just loathe Nestle.  They are an evil company.
fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooomr
wow that's nice
Try some health lady... I wud never promote refined sugar cake.. There are so many options out there besides diabetic delight.
OMG! WHY LOVE HEART! IT'S A HEART
But wouldn't the rainbow cake that has already been baked burn??
I made this cake  for a pride party 🏳️‍🌈
Fun
المقادير بالعربي يا ريت🤗😣😣😣
Deosebit. Felicitări!
Idk but did anyone else think the hearts ♥️ may be over cooked as it was in the oven twice
I love love love Bundt cakes! Thanks for teaching how to put a heart of love in the middle! Just Amazing!
good  work  😍
Since the hearts in the middle are already cooked, do they get really dry when you bake them for the second time with the chocolate cake batter?
I love you
Can i get that
I'm just getting pissy with all the comments about your use of the word 'Love ♥ heart' as opposed to just saying the word 'heart'.   As a fellow Aussie i know we refer to romantic love as: love heart. Which differentiates itself from the fleshy, beating, blood pumping organ which we call a 'heart'. I came to your channel for a cool recipe, not for a lesson in language or diction. Argh! Smh.  On a side note, i did wonder if the twice baked element in the cake would make it dry. Freezing the 'rainbow love heart' section was inspired.
Check out HowToVideo http://howtovideo.info/ for me fun videos like this one!
My Maire Wink Addiction xd
Nestlé boycott. Just check out why.
Someone please make this and make a video so I know what it would actually look like
This would be a pretty awesome way to come out. You could even make other pride flags, like transgender or bisexual or whatever you want
wow
too much talker
I love the rainbow cake
I made this cake and SOMEHOW managed to cut between every single heart so no-one got a heart until they bit into the cake
I like this nice  cake
I will make this cake next year on my 2 year anniversary of being out but with the trans flag as a heart ❤️ this is so cute
why didn't she say how much of the things/ingredients she was putting in, I mean how am I supposed to make it?
Maireeee Winkkkk 4ever :V
This would be great for pride month.
I love baking it's awesome it is so cool

Can u do this with cake mix?

YOU MAKE EVERYTHING LOOK  SO YUMMY AND DELICIOUSE
No entiendo ni maiz 😂 like si no entiendes
"It doesn't matter how much mixture you have in each bowl provided they are roughly the same" So what you are technically saying is that it does matter........
You should fold the flour in to prevent the gluten in the flour breaking up and to keep the cake light and fluffy
Should have added your eggs one at a time Adding them all at once can cause the egg and butter mixture to split
looks hard to make, but love it

Señora perfecta>:v Vengo por mi diosa maire
Yo vine por maire jajaja para ver que hizo mal
estoy aquí por mi diosa Maire :v
A trick that I have learned with anything chocolate is to add about 2 tablespoons of coffee and a pinch of salt, this enhances the chocolate flavor and adds richness. Don't worry you can't taste the coffee.
To elise can i cheat and use a packet mix for the rainbow hearts and the chocolate cake
Maire?
Ajajaj vengo por maire wink

If you cut the heart slices on alternating angles, you could make it go all the way around without chocolate in between...

Uhh I tried to make this cake but in a traditional cake mold. It stayed almost 2 HOURS in the oven but still the middle of the cake is not cooked. I should have make this in a long and thin mold... Everytime I try an english recipe it turns out reallyyyy really bad... I think I'm gonna stick to the french recipes 😅

I viewed tour tutorial on your rainbow cupcake and would love and info regarding doing a checkerboard cupcake.
Could you do this with a white/vanilla cake? I want to make this for my mother and chocolate gives her a headache.
She made no mention about letting it fill once you take it out the oven but before you put it in the freezer..do you not let it cool beforehand?
whew! how confusing...metric to ounces to tablespoons....gotta this recipe!
بدي منو
I love how she uses the word "Loveheart". Just sounds nice
eu amei seu bolo:-D
It's a lovely cake! Thanks for the recipe!!!
I love you 💕❤️😘

Can you save that
What if you don't have any of the butter that you need for that
Your a good baker
Butter
Or you could just buy salted butterflies
I freaken love your personality keep up the good work
If you add the rainbow cake in completely frozen and bake it the last time with that and the top of the bunt frozen, would it help it to not become over-baked or dry when it is re-baked?  Or would it hinder the baking process of the chocolate cake by making it harder to bake the middle due to the low temperature?
Lol but I still love ur channel
whenn you come to your mca vid

'Our hearts are freezing.'  Ah finally a cooking show I can relate to haha
What was that jump? 5:26
Why does she keep calling it a "love heart"? O_o It's just a heart. A heart implies love. Insisting on saying "love heart" over and over just sounds awkward and bizarre.
perfect way to come out to someone xD
Good
I Love you
my sister was asking if you eat all of the cakes you make I think you don't
Hi and I am P0LAR Gaming,  I just started my channel and it would be amazing if you could check out  my new vids. I understand if you don't like the style or quality (just  checking out my channel means the world to me!) of my videos but just  keep in mind that the more people that notice and enjoy my channel, the  bigger and better it can get!  Like comment if you enjoy the quality of my videos so this comment can  be noticed!  Thanks, P0LAR

Thanks for sharing.The cake looks amazing !  I have a query plz. I have a small otg and I wish to bake a 7.5" cake in 2 layers. Can I place  the cake tins in top and bottom rack, one on wire rack and the other on baking tray, since I do not have 2 wire racks right now?

Support the Thanian
A Dan and Phil cake!
can you a tie dye cake.
That "chocolate syrup" in the beginning was a gnash I was freaking out bc I have OCD and my pet peeves give me hives. She has a baking channel with 2M subs and she's telling her viewers the wrong thing. I was okay through out the video until she made the same thing and called it a chocolate gnash. That just irritated me so much so if you are reading this and actually want to be a baker a gnash is NOT a syrup. In fact, syrup is made with boiling water and syrup definitely NOT cream and chocolate chips. Please know that there is a difference between syrup and gnash.
yummy
it looks delicious xD
I love doing crafts and to bake

OMG! You are super pretty! And such a good baker! Thanks for doing this! Mine turned out amazing! :)

I made this and it turned out almost perfect - My rainbow colours did not come out so strong as they were supermarket bought but i have new wilton ones which work magic with vibrant colours! Everyone loved it (my husband wasn't too fond as I used dark choc but will mix it up with milk choice next time! ) I got lots of compliments from friends and family perfectly moist and tasty -  Thanks MyCupcakeAddiction! :)
I love it. so yummy and cool and amazing
I love how you call it a love heart ❤️💛💚💙💜

Can I make an entire rainbow cake with that rainbow cake recipe?
can you add salt to the butter before you put the butter in the mix
Can you do a finding Nemo pull-apart cupcakes. It could be Squirt or any character. Or can you do some Nemo cake pops?
What if I'm just using cake mix packets
What if I'm just using cake mix packets
Just took me three hours to make this cake and the chocolate batter didn't even cover the hearts!  What a waste of time!!!!
Where did you get that baking pan there the rainbow was in?
I really love u and your videos please do the bean boozled  challenge
yum yum lol
You and TheSimpleCooking channel should do a collab baking video
Wait, does It really matter if there is salt in the batter mixture? Because I have baked a quite of few cakes, pies, cupcakes, ETC. In my life time and I never have really checked to see if you really needed to add salt. I mean when I bake I always bake with salted butter unless the recipe calls for unsalted.
Who else never skips the intro because it looks so amazingly delicious?❤️😄
looks  like  a  dounut
I should've come out of the closet like this.
Pls make a mothers day cake love ur baking👅🎂🍰
You know Charli and ashlee

happy valentines day elise
You should totally make a cake with TOBLERONE. It is one of my favorite sweets ever! I bet it would make a really good cake. Love your chanel. Keep bringing us great recipes! Thanks!
yummy. yum
where can I find recipe please? I like this.
i made this for my mum im only 10 she loved it
why tf is she calling them "love hearts"
why does she talk so much 😭
I made this cake today and had a blast doing it. My only complaint is that nowhere in the video or instructions do you say how hot you set the oven to. I must have guessed wrong because my cake took longer to finish baking then your video mentioned.
i thought she was saying butt
Wow nice job
I tried making this but all the hearts fell over in the batter while baking, do you have any tips?
Your recipes are fantastic and I love your channel! <3
She  looks different in this video ..  Or it's just me 🤔
mmm
Pause at 13:09 LOL😂
I like you idea it's brilliant but I think if the heart inside was red it would be more like a valentines cake. But as I said I love your idea
Could I divide part of the cake batter to make the heart center. I am making a single colour
cool
What are the measurements for the cookie tray?? The description box doesnt say
Where do u get the tin from and heart cutters can u put all of the food in grams coz I don't have any cups and I don't know how much one cup is
Can you use the chocolate cake recipe for a normal cake and if yes, how many minutes do you keep it in the oven and what kind of tin?  Pllllzzz answer
How long is the rainbow cake put in the oven? How long is the whole bundt with the hearts in it put in the oven?  Thanks, Spencer

This would be cool to make for pride.

Oh, did you change your hair? It looks really nice :')

Could you make a gender reveal cake? could use a good recipe to have one
You are the best!!!
I've never made a cake that has butter and oil in it. Does it make a difference in the texture of the cake?
Wow😍❤️❣❣❣
wats with her saying love heart
It looks perfect!! Great job.
you should do a vegan cake
porque no montas mas videos en el canal en español
what time did you make this cake?????😊☺
aim kom from danmark i love you
This could probably also be done with plain vanilla or red velvet as the center heart!
I love these ideas i just wish that we could get some us measurements example how many cups how many table spoons or tea spoons oz is great if you have a scale
can u plz do another what can you...
I really enjoyed watching this
I LOVE this cake!!!!!
Cooking with squish
Nestle -Nest-Lay . 🤗💕🇬🇧
You wasted so much cake when cutting out the hearts! You should have flipped every other heart upside down! That's a pet peeve of mine when baking 😂😂😂

what can you jelly bean
Have you cut your hair because you look different
ummmmm xx

Did you have a haircut ? Or changed something in your make up? You look very pretty today!😊
Can you make a totoro cake?
It's a great idea. Even with just red (or pink) hearts inside, it would make a perfect valentine's day cake.
The heart cake will not bearns
but me and my mom don't have a mixr
I saw this on her Instagram I was so exited for this video  I love your vids they're amazing
I'm living in Germany, and here we do not have these Nestle Toll House Semi-Sweet Chocloate Morsales. What else can I take for making the ganache?
You should make some coconut macaroons 😍
💛💙💜💚❤️💖Yay!! I really like this recipe!!!💛💙💜💚❤️💖
Wauw it's looks so beautiful  😍
My friend just wanted to have hearts not the cake around it and she put pressure on her hand and it didn't spring back out and the cake just had a random hand print in it
no entiendo nada de lo  que dice..xk no se ingles.pero veo todos tus videos..^^ saludos desde españa ;)
I'm gonna make this... Love it
reminds me homosexual valentines day :D Looks great actually
I will definitely be making this. It's actually very simple the way you broke it down but everyone who looks at it will wonder at my magic tricks. I love watching your videos! I will certainly be trying as many as I can!
I love the contrast between the happy rainbow colours and the dark chocolate. The ganache on top really adds the perfect touch. Bundt pans come out with more servings too because of the hole right? It's gorgeous
I'm sick and when I watch your videos your awesome attitude makes me feel better ☺️
And I love your videos
Can't you do something Nederlands please 🤗🤗🤗
How big is the square cake pan
What does the salt in the butter do for the cake? (Why do I have to add salt to the batter if I use unsalted butter)

Ugh! I was looking all over your channel for a vanilla cake recipe and couldn't find one when I did my husbands birthday cake last week! I had to go with another cake recipe but I used your buttercream frosting recipe and OMG it was delicious! There's a bakery near me and I've always loved their frosting and it tastes almost identical! Only downside was it killed my shoulders from mixing so much, definitely need to get a kitchen aid mixer for that! <3
جميل 💗😊
the cake looks delicious
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
so cool
Wow!
Just a question. Why do you say love heart? I've always been confused about that
You could do this recipe with vanilla cake right?
This is so random but did you know the heart shape is shaped like that because if you put two anatomy hearts together it likes like that
Por favor me gustaria saber el nombre del ingrediente amarillo que lo pone antes de esencia de vainilla en la primera mezcla
Thanks for making me get into baking
I watch every single vid

DO HOW TO MAKE RAINBOW BAGELS!! there is a bagel store in New York that makes them! they have a confetti cake cream cheese "frosting" YOU SHOULD SO LOOK UP HOW TO MAKE THEM, AND THEN MAKE A VIDEO!!
Why do Australians call hearts love hearts? Here in America we just call them hearts.
Omg I love ur videos there are so awesome. I want to meet u so badly
I had a dream I met you lol, and I got to make cupcakes with you! Too bad it was just a dream though
Will you do a hello kitty cake
cool and so sweet.. :)
This is an amazing cake I will have to make it
Dan and phil cake!
This is great, looks easy too! <3 love the rainbow hearts.
Wouldn't it be easier to make a rainbow layered bunt cake, cut it into slices, cut out the heart shapes, then rebuild them into the new chocolate cake batter? Then you could re-use the outsides of the heart, fill it with icecream and reassemble it. Then you'd have two awesome cakes.
With the extra cake scraps you can make cake pops :D
make a popularmmos cake please
Could you please make something for people with allergies? I can't have dairy gluten sugar or soy so that would be awesome to see how to make some yummy treats without those ingredients! Thank you! <3
