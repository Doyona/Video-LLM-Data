will be using this for cosplay, thanks.
Thank you
I only came back for the nostalgia
This is not safe to use. Crayola is warning people to not use these for lips.
I found the video I watched since 2014
P
Hi
I remember that video 💖
Does anyone know what happened, why did she stop posting? Has she ever explained this anywhere? I miss her videos I hope she's doing OK :(
I love this idea 💕💕💕💕
I used to make this in elementary!!! Lips super chapped but super fun!!
I remember watching this video when I was in preschool!..
this video has such a grip on me at age 8 omg
damn this video was made when i was 3 💀
i can’t find a single red crayon 😭
i remember watching this video omg:( the nostalgia:(
i used to watch this video all the time 😭
do you need coconut oil
5:20 😱😍😍😍😍
nostalgia 😭
Holy hell. I remember watching this when I was younger a ton of times 😂 nostalgia.
Can we use any type of coconut oil?
“She-ah” butter
I can't wait to make it!
I miss u ..😢
Ok
Omg this is amazing can't wait to try this, thank you so much!
Does anyone why she doesnt upload videos ?? I miss her videos
POV: the videos that you watched  when you were 9 and ur mom wouldn’t bye you lipstick
Here in 2021 because I decided I’m gonna do it
Thankyou
All the nostalgia is coming back
Love this DIY video, did it with my mom and we both LOVED it!!
Does it wrk wit Shea butter instead of coconut oil
I have been watching this video for asmr purposes since i was 13 and im 20 now
If you didn’t watch this you had no childhood
I am now 9 and I need make up
Wow, I don't know how I made my way over 7 years later, but she is so incredibly gorgeous and I love her smile!! I wish she still posted 😭
Are crayons not toxic?
"alien with blue lips"  me watching this to make vriska lipstick 0-0
This sucked,it didnt even work
To much talking.
Did we all watch this video in like 2014 , tried it & it never worked? 🤣😭
this is the first video to give me asmr. I listened to the voice over part over and over again. I didn't even know what asmr was
When this was a trend
Coming back for the nostalgia man. I was so obsessed with watching diy makeup videos bc my mom wouldn’t let me wear makeup. I would be so sad that I couldn’t have any real makeup lmao but making my own was fun. Now I’m 16 and I have a whole collection of makeup behind me ❤️ maybe that sounds stupid but it’s just a sweet memory for me ig
omg i used to watch this so much
man this brought back memories
DAYMNNNN I REMEBER WATCHING THIS WHEN I WAS A CHILLDDDD
Hello anyone here in 2020 almost 2021 in quarantine just watching childhood videos?
intro ——————————————————————————————————————————— doing the crayon lipstick: ——————
i don't think you should use crayons for lipstick. even though crayola crayons are non-toxic, that doesn't mean you should put it on your lips. you should try this with face crayons from places like halloween stores instead
I remember u from along time ago like 2015
I remember watching this as a little kid
Very good content 💕😌☁️✨
I wanna make a business
Good video but you talk to much
I noticed you can use food coloring instead of crayon too
how do you actually apply this?
THAT PICTURE LOOKS LIKE VERONICA LODGE

This was my childhood
me watching this 6 years later now that I finally have 3 dollars for lipstick 👁👄👁

Omlllll I watched this like 5 years ago 🤭😅
2020 anyone no just me ok... 🦄💖❤
Good and all...   But how do you put this on your lips?    Do you kiss it through that container or....   Idk now I can't stop laughing or thinking about trying to kiss the lipstick/gloss I'm each box😂
I was only 4 years old when this was made and I never did this lol
I remember I was obsessed with this hack but never went through with it damn memories...

*Cómo morir por un solo video de tutoríal para hacerte un lipstick de un MALDITO CRAYON*,el crayon,no es tóxico pero a la ves si :v a lo que quiero llegar es que al momento de ponerte el crayon derretido en tus labios puedes morir,pues,el crayon tiene plomo,y esas cosas. Pero NIÑOS!!! NO LO INTENTEN TIENEN EL BENDITO RIESGO DE MORIR POR ENVENENAMIENTO O PUEDE LLEGAR A UNA HEMORRAGIA Y ENTRE OTRAS ES PELIGROSO,aunque la gente Piense que soy un comentario falso,NO.

This way is great because I tried to do this about two years ago but the microwave way and apparently I was supposed to put the container in the middle of the microwave put she didn’t say to do that then the crayon blew up inside the microwave and so we had to get a new one because when I tried to scrub the crayon off, it didn’t work 😂

Love it keep up the good woork
Who is in 2018?
Am I the only one that thinks she sounds like kim k in this vid??
are crayons safe for lips?
I like its 👍
Her nails are so cute
You talk so much
if you make lipstick you're a dipstick
Cool picture 💓
I love your nails it reminds me of candy corn
Why does my lipstick get hard after a few days?
Hey Sofia is my name 2
Can i still use vaseline? I need answers know
Can i use vaseline instead?
WOW! that lipstick is really cool i should try making my own lipstick like you
If I was you I would cut the intro. Is more talking than the instruction
I saw this when I was Little next thing you know it’s 2017
people r so ungrateful leave the girl alone
I put melted crayon on my lips and its hard when it dries
We could make with out coconut oil
It will go off or now other wise i didnt use it
An easy way to get the paper off a crayon is water
Her voice is awful! Seriously...
DUDE u talked for 2 min and 31 sec!!
No offense but you seriously gotta sound better. You sound so depressed. Be happy
Hey sofia I have tried to make this lipstick over and over again. But its not very pigmented. What do you suggest I do. (Is it because I'm black? )
Sounding like Kim fucking Kardashian
Im just gonna stik to painting my lips with face paint
Can we use just normal oil not coconut oil?
I just thought I should mention that crayons are TOXIC UNLESS SOLID. This as all 'crayon makeup resipies' are a cream and not solid. I was going to use a recipe similar to this as a cheap practice theater makeup until my friend informed me that it was toxic and could cause adverse reactions if you use it over a long time. I warn you you shouldn't but its your face if you wish to poison it.
Video starts :2 :33  Your welcome !!🙃
Wow is cool 😚😚
THIS IS THE LONGEST INTRO EVER THE. CRAFT STARTS AT 2:31
Thanks for the videos. how did you do your nails I love it

How did you wash the bowls
I know this video is old but plzz reply can we vaseline instead of coconut oil
Her nails look like those American triangular hard candies
ur pretty in subscribing
When she is talking she looks like she is crying
Since you can't use crayons for lipstick you can use the same recipie and make something that behaves like an oil pastel
can you use Vaseline instead of coconut oil?
Yeah this works so well. thank you and it is very easy to do.
you talk to much
If anyone is trying to find different substances to use besides coconut oil, Vaseline and olive oil work great! But with the olive oil you might want to add a little more crayon because it's already a liquid!
Sofia you should try to wipe your lips probably before applying another lipstick color

You smile weird
I really want to do this now
were i buy the coconut oil
speechless.
were do you get the coconut oil????
I like your makeup
Does it matter what kind of crayons you use?
What the fuck is wrong with the people in the comments? Are y'all fucking stupid? If you don't like her voice, leave the video. Don't watch. Don't complain like a stupid 3 year old. I see so many people commenting, hating and complaining about her voice. She didn't choose to have this voice. Do you know how to *mute* the volume? Do you know how to click *out* of a video? Do you know how to *not to be an ignorant piece of shit*? If you think it's dangerous then sure, comment about it, warn people. But do fucking not, again, do *fucking* *not* be an asshole about it. Most people are smart enough to decide whether they'd do it in their own risk.
the video starts at 2:30
her steps where fake cause my lipstick turned it wax so don't try this at home 😣😣😣
vanila extract gives it a little sweet flavor

Ah this has 14 mill views!
Your voice is so annoying
such a long intro
the Intro is boring
Can you use hair coconut oil
Can you melt it in the microwave????
If you want a lipstick that's more vibrant you can get some eyeshadow ( the colour you want your lipstick to be) and mix it with some transparent  lipgloss.
stoo talking and just shiw us
came after watching threadbanger
she does not sound like mrainda sings.
i tried this with my nieces and it was horrible so unless. u want your face to break out don't try this
that's so cool to do crayon lipstick
she is kind of gothy
عبوشكل دي اعلانااات :٧
could you use Vaseline?
The video actually only starts at 2:32

rube
Will it smell like wax in your house?
Her voice is so annoying
Can I just melt it in the microwave?
omg i love ur voice even thou i commented for too long  TUMBS UP IF YOUR WATCHING THIS ON 2016!!!!!!!!!!
Do we have to use coconut oil?
You are literally the image of Lauro Morano from Disney Channel!!
cool
Not all wax is the same.  Crayons are not meant to be melted for candles or hygienic to put on your face, they have chemicals in them that become toxic when burned, melted, etc... you should not take advice like this from someone who doesn't really know what they're doing.
so good but I added vitamin e and Shea butter to it it becomes very tender
she sounds like a really depressed goth in the voiceover what a bitch
your intro is so long..  but I love your videos
I got a lipstick add for this XD
can i use normal cooking oil? XD
isn't it poisonous ?
I love the black lipstick. Just dont talk for so long. XD

I love theis video
kay
Holy crap I remember..I watched this video 2 days after it was posted, and now I'm watching it 2 years later!
how do you apply the "lipstick" when it in a box and how do you turn it into the tube type of lipsticks
It sounds like she smokes 10 packs an hour😂😂😂
do the crayons safe to use on lips?
can you eat cocunut oil
Weird
Where is she from????
h
i like it but the crayon may be toxic
look at her face at 1:06
i think sofia has a stunning voice
so cute nails
how do you apply it? what happens when it hardens in the containers?
I LOVE this video :) :) :)
also do you have to use them type of crayons or can you use a different type of crayons?:)
instead of boiling the lip stick can you put it in the microwave for about 1 minute? :)
its dangerous
tes fol ou quoi
will the lipsticks dry and if so does that mean they won't work or is there a way to reliquefy it... and how do you apply it
why do you talk so much
did it work with petroleum only? if theres no coconut oil.
what about if you are in Guyana and you don't have that kind of coconut oil can you take another coconut oil
videos*
this girl is really boring she talks way to much in the beginning I don't like any of her videps

14mil views congrats!🎉🎉💛
I have some really old cocnut oil that has been sitting in my bathroom for a few years now. Do you think I could still use it?
I  like her lipstick
Okay, so I want to know when you can put the crayon stuff on your lips? Does it have to be in the melty form, or do you have to let it cool and then try to smear it on?
I did this with  one my bffs and it does work. My favorite is the sheer orange it looks like a red. The only problem is that it leaves a stain on ur lips  and after a while it just starts to blend in with ur lips
Thanks Sofia I loved THE lip stuff but only one color worked lol
😉
i love the red one
new sub
how do you even put the lipstick  on you ?
it's awesome Sofia

hi my name is emilee im 12 and I really liked your video espeacillay at the end where you tried them all. they all looked great on u!
This is so nasty,yucky
guys you need to do it  it really works perfectly
I have tried using coconut oil in lip balms because people say that it is good for your lips but actually it does the reverse. It chaps your lips and is really uncomfortable to have on.
will these cause a allergic reaction to my lips?
she looks like the crazy girl from american idol that took off her cowboy hat and went "I don't need this anymore..."
little do u know
this is so amazing
How do you put it on
You are soo cool
hey  wow
I no longer feel ashamed to be the only person who called Shea-(shay) butter she-uh butter 😂😂😂
Thanks!!I used this method to dip dye my hair!!!ILYSM!!!

CANDY CORN NAILS AWESOME
I just put in Vaseline and Crayons but sometimes you can use fragrance sprays and candle wax
I tried this a while ago and your right it's okay and awesome and I did black before and blue also pink and red it's SUPER AWESOME!!!!
Where did u get the container
I know this video is old.....but I think you look good in the black lip color. Goes good with your hair and skin tone without looking too dark and gothic like.

cool lipsticks
a easy way to do it is..... 1.find bottle tops like from gatorade or coke 2.get crayons and oil 3.take the paper off and put pieces of crayon in the top 4.a little oil depending on how big the top is 5.put it in the microwave for 10 sec. then mix with a toothpick  6.do that til' it's melted  7.then put it in the freezer til' hard  8.and that's it put some on your finger and put it on ur lips   ......OK I'm not trying to be mean or like mess this vid up for her but it's just a suggestion you can do it her way or my way there's many ways to do it but this is the way me and my cousin found it works best ...so yeah thanks 4 reading this .... ..  .bye
I name is Kyle live like it because it's so my meeting you and I like both
Thanks a lot! now my rather girlie four year old is constantly asking me when she'll be old enough to do this! lol. Great vid tho. maybe a really really light pink.....
i try it and it did not work
CRAYOLA PUT OUT A STATEMENT AND SAID NOT TO DO THIS check out my beauty hack playlist it has a safe way to do it
that's why you have horrible comment's  oldy lady
poisonly yucky that will make you have an allergic reaction that's why  I never ever do it IN MY LIFE NEVER DO IT AGAIN NAUGHTY LADY!!!!!!!
She talks to much

Sooooooooooop cool!!!
Sooooooooooop cool!!!
hello
Cool
can u do rainbow
Can you use olive oil
coll my BFF
coll my BFF
Spikin in spanis??
Great video!! Cool colour choices
That's awesome. Did you find out about it your self
just tried this out, horrible idea. Are you sure this was a safe idea, even to put on your lips? I followed all the instructions, the crayon didn't melt, I set it on a higher setting and that made the glass bowl rattle and even crack from the heat because the low setting just wasn't melting these crayons at all. I popped it in the microwave, it melted, but the consistency was so waxy that I figured, "eww, I don't think that's good to put on my lips," so I dumped it out. Not to mention it ruined my glass bowl. Yikes!
that is mean
Do a house tour
maddie
i liked the pink
I hate your voice but love your videos! 😍😁😓😯
If you're allergic to any of the ingredients and you do this, it's your own fault. Crayola is Non-toxic, so if kids get it in the eyes, or accidentally ingest it, they won't get sick. It won't stop them from having an allergic reaction to it... I'm allergic to their erasable  crayons (I think that's what it is...) so I obviously wouldn't use that... 😂
She talk to much dam come on 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😍
shut up it is not her fault she so
HEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY watch what you use; no turning back and what I mean is ...use crayons that you don't care about. Are you doing that in this video?                                                  YES                              NO                               MAYBE               please say YES or MAYBE

Why make such an effort when you can buy a lipstick in seconds? Besides, these are not safe for our lips. Goes into our system. You can imagine.

u talk too much get to the point..
Nice job!!! It actually worked!!! Also if u wondering how to clean the little metal bowl inside out all u really have to do is, (well what I did) get a washcloth soaked in hot water (or just a paper towel in hot water)! It was REALLY fun I'd DEFINENTLY reccomend!!!
I love this video
Stop talking so long

In Romania this video appeared on television. Did you know?
This is a very cool video
I love the purple one
I love her nails
clever
I love ur candy corn nails
Your lips are literally the perfect shape omg
u talk to much
So if this vid was loaded a year before the disclaimer from Crayola was added in the description, don't you have an obligation to your subscribers and other fans to either plaster it across the vid itself or just remove the vid altogether from this site? I mean, shouldn't you have actually CHECKED with the manufacturer before claiming their product was safe for off-label use?Or don't you care enough about the stupid kids who would use this DIY without verifying it's safe because they're too lazy to read the disclaimer? Don't want to lose your 13 mil views, huh?
She talked for 2:30 way to long
I love it, but you talked ALOT!
so pritty😊
I like the idea

So cool
I don't know I liked the purple
vid starts at 2:30
Her voice kinda annoys me but its unique and I'm not trying to be a hater just saying it out there
DONT DO THIS WITH CRAYOLA. They have said that they're products are non toxic but you should NEVER use them for cosmetic reasons. It hasn't been tested and it could turn out horrible.
This was the first video I saw of u ily💘
I luv your nails😍 so pretty
boo!!!!!!!!!!
This is so cool!!!
wow. lipstick from crayons, candy corn for nails,whats next, cotton candy for hair......
she is like half of miranda

She sounds like Miranda sings
love your viedos but are you sick becaues your voice is irratation
This is a good idea but not good for ur health crayons have things in it we shouldn't even digest that's why kids not supposed to eat crayons so I would not have my clients take heed in this it a health hazard
I watched ja dis radd's vid for crayon lipstick
pause at 2:13
her voice is so annoying
Apartment stores 😂

I love it
To make clean up easier, put foil on the inside of your bowl, so the crayon mixture won't stick to the bowl.
Can you send me some of your foundation
Men this girl talk a lot

her voice is just because she is from somewhere else she has an accent so don't be so rude
Crayons is they have a experadation date?
I

MY NAME IS SOFIA but its spelt with a "ph" not an "f"

Pause at 5:36
So nice I made a purple on it turned out perfect
I think its better to use branded lipstick instead of putting risk to your skin.I am not sure whether lipsticks made out of crayons are safe or not.Its just my opinion.No offence to video.
This is a long intro
You sound sad
If I don't have coconut oil what I can use, please?
Is it compulsory to use only crayola crayon??
If I don't have a coconut oil what I can use, please?
Aren't that lipsticks kind of insafe ?
Where do you get the coconut oil.
Where do you buy it
will glass cups work?
I tried this and it worked ,I made 3 lipsticks!!
http://www.crayola.com/faq/safetymsds/is-it-safe-to-use-crayola-crayons-to-make-lipstick/        They don't want u making lipstick with crayons

Using crayon for lipstick is not good for your health. You can see that in the box of crayon mentioned a line: do not eat. Because the color used to make crayons can not be eaten. When you applied crayons to your lips, you might think you won't eat it but infacts women eat a lot of lipstick in their life. Use this too often will brings you to the hospital.
How do you do it 🙎
Ok, weirdy

Great video! + i love your voice.💚
I have a channel here on YouTube that I'm starting (not this one) and I'm watching popular diy vids and taking notes for editing and how I'm going to make my video look "professional".  And I have a few questions for the peeps in the comments  1. Do you like to see intros with the person talking and giving an overview?  2. I don't like pop music so I'm not putting pop music in my videos. Do you think that will effect my audience size? Because all of the popular vids I watch have pop music 3. Do you have any tips for me of things you like to see in videos?  Ps.. I AM NOT ADVERTISING I hate when people do that  I hope this isn't spamy

Your cool
why didn't u d red!!!!
Make sure your crayons don't have lead!
Crayons have petroleum (gasoline) in them so in fact its not safe for your lips.
You are beautiful girl!
Listen, I'm not sure if this is 100% true, but my father told me that he heard on the news that making your own lipstick out of crayons in actually dangerous because when you melt the crayon, all of the chemicals that make it non-toxic evaporate leaving you with a toxic wax that shouldn't be put on your skin. Just putting that out there because I want you guys to be safe but look in to it more if you want. Here is a link to a story I read: http://www.babble.com/beauty/diy-crayon-lipstick-is-it-
girl always have a pack of crayons 64 pack XD
not cool at the begining
you toke half of the video just yappin
The voiceover is so annoying your voice is just 😁
Your so fucking girly
Can you please make your intros a little shorter please?

+sofiastyled can you put the lipstick into a lipstick or small lip balm container ???
Do you have to use oils?
This was posted in my birthday☺️

Does it bother anyone else how nasal her voice is? I mean- I love the video *I really do*, but the nasal voice...
I love your videos I just subscribed😊love you
Crayons although they are non-toxic are not designed to be applied on your body. Therefore have not been tested on humans. So i doubt that you are qualified to tell people that this is safe. If you dont know there have been many people reporting reactions because they applied this. If you still have doubts Crayola released a statement stating the dangers
Thoa
I love you can you make more videos
Answer please do u need crayon or can u just put eyeshadow
Mack nailpoish
Can u make another lip balm diy video
Too bad crayola just verified that they does don't suggest to use their products for beauty. 😐😂

Loved it. This will be one of our special summer project with my daughter. Making canyon lipsticks!!! :) Thanks
Your voice is so annoying no offence but it is
http://www.crayola.com/faq/safetymsds/is-it-safe-to-use-crayola-crayons-to-make-lipstick/     Crayola has made a statement in which they say that even if their products are labelled as "non toxic" they are not meant for this use and that they don't recommend it. If the manufacture company says that it would be wise for you to listen.  And I found many links stating the same thing just by searching "crayola use in diy makeup statement" in google.

This is so cool! But ladies, please make sure you use non-toxic crayons that have no lead in it. Yes they still sell those, especially here in the Philippines at places that sell chinese made bargain school supplies. They make Crayola brand knock offs too so be wary.

Hello I alya. Iwant now about the crayon
She is just the cutest...omg
For colorful lips you could also just use eyeshadow. Get choose the color you want and dab it on your lips till your lips are completely covered and the color is to your liking. Then you can just put Vaseline or lipgloss over it to hold the color
do you have to use a particular kind of crayon? like does it need to be wax based or oil based?
You could add glitter
Awesome video new subbie!:)
that is just so stupid
omg...
Can i pour it to the eos container? Please for answer (anyone)

Wow I have to try immediately when I have time! Thank you for sharing this :)
If you use a substitute for the coconut oil, would you use the same amount?
Nice nails :)

Thats so weird but kool but what do u put the liquid lipsticks in afterwards???  Like if u wanna carry it w u ?

Did you know that wax is bad for your lips so your lips can get  an invention I think that's true my friend said that and also why did you put X's on the melted crayons
I don't subscribe to any channels besides my husband's but I just love what you do so it was a no brainer, I hit that subscribe button within a second (my husband actually pointed you out because he knows I love this kind of stuff)  I really wish I could be as motivated as you, I struggle badly. I've always wanted to make a YouTube channel but have never had the confidence. Anyway, love what you do and I'll be following xx thanks for sharing.﻿
Ur voice!!❤️
She kind of looks like laura muarona
very cool idea, and you're super sweet and really pretty,  but I seriously think you should read this article. Sorry to burst your bubble.  http://www.babble.com/beauty/diy-crayon-lipstick-is-it-safe/
So cool
😃
Sofiastyled can u reuse this even without it bring warm?
Ash a!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
Girl, the black is like perfect for you well all the colors are :)
Got it write
like if your watching in 2015!!!
i love this thanks
I love video 💄💄💄
This is a great tutorial but crayola crayons are far from natural. Their main ingredients are paraffin wax and colour pigment. Paraffin is generally not safe (and it is often mixed with other harsh chemicals when used commercially) and crayola refuse to disclose the composition of the colour pigment. Corporate companies refusing to reveal the ingredients they use = something unsafe that they'd rather not let people know about, especially since crayola is aimed at children and claim that it's 100% safe.  They do state on their website that they use ingredients which have not been proven to cause side effects in low doses. Translation: they use a little bit of toxic chemicals in each crayon. Add that up over time by using a lipstick with those chemicals (lipstick is reapplied daily so it adds up quite a lot) and you'll end up ingesting those ingredients in high doses.
You are so pretty and this video was amazing!!!!😁😁😁
Nice job  👍✋👍
does crayons contains led???
missallylove and michelemussleman are desperate for attention how sad keep being mean idk its just making You 2 feel worse :p and also her boice is pretty dont listen to thise to brainiaks
I really enjoyed your  video
Aha butter Sh ay
I have a really stupid question  Could you use a microwave?
I like lip stick a lot
Will it look matte? :-)
you r awsome
i love this one if i have time i'll try it
Would this work with cheap crayons?
ooo gracias por la idea 👌❤️
B
very good help u x
I love your eyeshadow color!😍
What happens if I don't use any kind of oil?
Hey, I'm 4 subscribers off 1.6k and if any 4 people who like diy videos want to see more please come check me out after watching this video!! Thank you XOX
Good Job
Could you use Vaseline or petroleum jelly in place of coconut oil?
Hi my name is marian I'm new to you channel I really love your videos
Her voice is so annoying
Cool
I don't know why but my lipstick always applies chunky whenever I make it...I follow all the steps too? Not sure what I'm doing wrong?
Great tutorial!  We used a slow cooker and pop cans.  It takes longer to warm up, but is an even temperature and a little safer for younger SStylers.  Clean up is also a snap, just toss 'em in the recycling.
i love ur video
I love your videos :) I am definitely going to have to try this one out:)
Pretty nifty =D
The black Crayola says negro😭😂😩
Practice making your voice sound a little older That voice and the braids makes you look like a "Wannabe young" type of person.
Is it non-toxic because before in primary school we used it to decorate our faces and i started swelling up.
Omg shahs a beard
Your voice is so calming
I hope I'm not the only one that thinks she sounds EXACTLY like Kim Kardashian..
I love your video
I love this tutorial but your voice sooooo fricken annoying ugh god 😩😒
I love your videos , but crayons are toxic, you can try using natural ingredients like castor oil , beeswax, carnauba wax , Shea butter , mica colourants to create your own unique shade. I have done hundreds of recipes using just these ingredients😍😘
how is this even good for ur lips?
I think you looked really pretty with the purple and orange one. :)
And then I spent like a minute watchi it melt😩 don't watch this
U spent two and a half minutes just talking😩
Good job😎
I love the way her voice sounds
wow!! never knew this you made my day thanks a bunch SofiaStyled
Your voise is not anoying😊😊
Your a talker!
Girl, your eye makeup is on,point!
Or you could just go out and buy lipstick.
Can u use Vaseline instead of coconut oil ??
How do you put it on your lips
omg i love you sofia
What ingredients will you need
Purple is my favorite
Great tutorial but that voice is so irritating
The way she said " especially good" in the beginning. 😂
We're do you find coconut oil and do you need water in the bowl?
😖
Really amazing!!!...
your're beautiful :)
Cool nails
In fact..... 😂😂😂😂
Lol my neighbor tried that xD
I did this like 5 times but when it hardens... it doesn't go soft as I wanted.. How is it not becoming soft? Help please? I used olive oil and petroleum jelly but still doesn't work. Please help .. is there something wrong I did? :'c
To me, she looks good in the pink and purple colors.
Can you put it in plastic bags
All the colors look stunning at your lips! Love this tutorial!
Where do  you get coco nut oil

Не се прави червило от пастели,защото като оближеш това нещо и ще го глътнеш!!!!

You gave a long lecture until 2:31 and your video was about 5:43.You and started the real video at 2:32
thank u so much  this DIY helped me  and i love u so much <3
two questions..  1) Can you use canola oil? and if so, how much?  2) Can the crayon lipstick stain your lips?
That is so freaking cool! I really like your video and this is just awesome; you have done a wonderful job and thank you for the video!
I know I'm a boy I didn't use it but if my friend wore that I would ask if she watched this video and I could use a melted crayon for something else.
how do you take it off do you ned anything to take it off with
Vaseline like lotion?
You are really creative
I made a blue and it so pretyy
You talk to much

Hii!! I had one question :) when i make it ... It's bad for my lips or not??  P.s. i'm from georgia and i can't talk well :-(
Can you not talk so much and get right to it cus I'm sure most don't care
how do you sounds in 0:20 regular and in 2:42 you sounds different?
Not to be Weird or anything but I need serious answers! I have an ear infection and I tried to blow my nose but my ear make a huge pop sound! Is it normal or should I see the doctor again
I love your candy corn nails :3 Thank you for this tutorial, my girlfriend and I are going to try this out tonight!

Oh my god, I just LOVE this idea.  I'm going to make some for my best friend who lives over 2000 miles away!!! She's going to love it!!
Can u use twistable crayola
Am i the only one concerned about putting crayons on my lips? Like yeah some may be non toxic but i'm pretty sure if crayons were meant to be used as a lipstick, then crayola would be a lipstick company... not a drawing company for kids... 😂 Honestly just go buy a lipstick that is vegan and chemical/parable free or whatever, if your that worried about chemicals. ﻿
Do u need coconut oil
U do look like lauren morano (Austin and ally)
Please go to my channel and subscribe
cant wait to start on mines

For Anyone Reading This:   I know self promotion is NOT cool and annoying,and I understand if you think this comment is those things, but it would mean so much if you could checkout my channel and maybe subscribe. I had taken a break from Youtube for a while,but now im back to make WAY better quality DIY`s, Hauls, Tutorials for nails, hair , etc. and much more! Anyways it would mean so much if you could help me out by subbing to me you won`t regret it. Thank for reading this :)

Your voice is so cute
Hey missallylover thats a rude comment I should know &I'm 11.
I notice that u have the candy corn nails on that u did
Next tutorial can you just get straight into it instead of going on and on.
No! This is not safe! Just because it is "non-toxic" as a crayon doesn't mean the substance is safe to heat and put near your mouth. http://www.crayola.com/faq/safetymsds/is-it-safe-to-use-crayola-crayons-to-make-lipstick/
The black look good with your makeup
That's a rude comment missallylover
Hey missallylover that's a rude comment
UR SO ANNOYING
Can you use honey?
Can you use honey?
This is so cool! I'll definitely try this out one day (: Thanks for making this <3

You talked half way through the video
I was looking at your hair and thinking of hair chalk and you should make a video on hair chalk
this sounds so cool!
Why do you haft to have caconut oil?????????
I am going to try this now
How do you get it off
Ok just to be sure, which coconut measurement makes the lipstick so it shows more?
this is SUCH an awesome channel, I cannot afford to buy good lipsticks due to having a wolf that eats a TON so these do it yourself vids are an amazing relief because I am able to make it out of household items
I'm gonna show this to my mom. I'm sure she'll let me.😆
Do you seriously talk like that?
I love Mails pretty
thats dumb crayon are not good for ur lips
Wow so perfect
Thats really gross
Is it okay to use petroleum jelly instead  of coco oil?
How can you do that I like it
OK! This was sooooooo long ago but I really enjoyed it!!!! It was amazing and dont listen to the haters! There obviously just jealous BTW this was the first video I ever watched and im looking forward to seeing the others and a lot more coming up :) nice job!!
That's cool
Hi could we use olive oil instead??
U know it seems pretty gross to put crayon lipstick ewwwwwwww
omg, when I was 9ish i would try to put actual crayon on my lips....
Your nails are so pretty I have a doubt How long can we use these lipsticks? I mean 1 month or 2 months?
Vaseline lotion can or not? Please reply i want to make this one.
what if we using coconut milk? is it okay??
How is it ok when they teach you as a child don't eat crayons but when you put anything on your lips it is being eaten off little by little
Can you do eye shadow

Iip
Uko

IT WOORK!!!!!!!!
I'm a very honest person. So, I'm going to be honest. Your voice, it sounds, very... forced like, well annoying. But other than that, nice DIY.  very helpful <3 And because I'm telling you this, doesn't mean I dislike you :) You seem like a very nice person
AFTER U PUT IT IN THE CONTAINERS U HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE FRIDGE OR FREEZER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is it just me or is it ignoring that u have to listen to them talk FOREVER??? like come on u did the video to show us something NOT to talk us to death!!!!!
Cool
I'm going to retry this
You talk so much in the video
i cant hear you over the music
get to the point already!!!!!!:-( :-( :-( :-(
Thank you :-) :-) :-)!!!###
Cool
Why are people so mean to you??? You're beautiful and very crafty +Sofiastyled , they're probably just jealous that your skinny and pretty! They are probably freaks and very overweight... I watched your draw my life and dont worry, i have thick eyebrows. Just keep doing what your doing and ignore the HATERS. Courage.
I love you
could you use baby oil?
That moment when your house smells like wax crayons
Your channel is actually very helpful. Thanks for the cool videos.
Like ur videos but ur voice pisses me off!!
Amazing mine really works
i totally want to try that
How will you get it on if its dry?? Its always crumbling on my lips!
Lol shea butter is pronounced like shay not she-uh 😂
She sounds like Kim kardashian
Wow, this is actually kinda cool!!!! I think I'm gonna try this 4 the next school dance :)
She reminds me of an older version of ladyxeona
How long does it stay on with olive oil, because I can't wait to try this because other lipsticks and lip glosses come off really quickly. ❤️
Can u do this without crayons?
You are beautiful, can you add smells into it or will it burn
But...those r wax crayons?
I tried it at home it did not work
Wod you mak a kechan
I love your nails
you sound weird LOL
I love it
Amazing :O I cant wait to start this
The part when you try on the melted crayon lipstick it didn't show that much color
Do u have to use coconut oil
She has the weirdest voice
This is the first video i have watch of your it is amazing im going to try it out hopefully put it on youtube
What happen to red

CANDY CORN!!!
Hey you are just so awesome and soo creative :-) :-) :-)!!!###
Quick question, if I want it to be matte , is it possible?
Can it work with  Olive oil.
OMG i loved this recipe!! i made a pink one for myself and it was amazing :) Thank you soo much xx
how do you keep it moist so it doenst dry in the plastic container
smart, cool, creative and cheap
my mom doesn't ever have coconut oil
My only critique is that at the beginning you talk waaaaay too much
#asksofia
Can you do a house tour video plz :(
u sound like a kardashian
This video is cool
i need a tutorial for your make up in this video!
My sis side how old are you but are you 21 👍👎🙊🙀👊👓
I love the diy video itself bcuz of the simple fact that my skin is very very sensitive and no matter if the make up I buy is expensive or cheap, it always breaks me out. I even tried the hypoallergenic kind and it does the same thing.  So all in all, these diy videos about make up works for me. I just have 1 problem. There's too much talking. Everytime I watch this video, I find myself pressing forward to get to the part where she actually starts making the lipstick. It's like one of those numbers u call when u have to listen to the operator say all the prompts b4 u get to the one u need!
OMG YOUR VOICE DRIVES ME UP THE WALL ITS SO VALLY GIRL NO HATE JUST AN OPINION
I think the orange looked really good on you and so did the purple. idk why you thought it didn't work but it was a really pretty color
AMAIZING.  I	LOVE!!!
I love all uv your video
Vaseline wouldve worked better :)
So im putting the vaselibe,olive oil and the crayon if i dont have the stuff in the video...??
Thanx Sofia for sharing, I'll try with the crayons of my baby....So cheap to be feminine. I have a question, how long does it stay ? Do you know a way or a product to add for a longer lasting? Sorry for my bad english, thx again
U sound like Kim k
Her voice
me made bracelet out of pop tabs
Iowa up in iiiiwkrjjsjjeiii
Im my dads daughter
I love your video oh and im a kid
She talkyd really wierd
l like the way you did your nais
Do the crayons stain the container?
Tht is cool
I like your nails
This is the best gift for preteens and teens
I kind of wonder about the ligit-ness of this thing. Bunny over at Grav3yardGirl did this, and she didn't get the results you got. She had a really hard time with it, and once it cooled on her, it was near impossible to get the pigments to come up. It basically turned into another crayon but with coconut oil in it.
This is so cool I loved the orange and purple one the most they are so beautiful thank you so much !!!
Another alternative is vegetable shortener and you can use a microwave
+sofiastyled its didnt work
THANK GOD FOR YOU!!!
Did the crayon lipstick really work
Cute nails and awesome video!!!
😍
How long does it last on you? or How many times do you re-touch, in let's say, an 8 hour period?
Can you use  vicks ?
Love❤❤❤
Can you use olive oil instead of coconut oil?
Yr nails r so cute
4
I bought some bowls and I am not sure if it is heat safe bowl. I did some research and I could not find my answer! Can you help me? It is called anchor custard cups.
AWESOME! this is like the plain and simpler way to make lipstick :) I like that ^_^ ! ! ! ! !
How come you talk like that? Not being mean just a question but why?
At the beggining its boring but then its even better at the end part
Is it just going to color your lips a little or what?
No ugly
Cute
nyay!
what happens if they dry up????
your a dork
How did you apply it? Love this by the way!:)
Your voice is so ignoring
Cool
Like the colors really good
You sound like Kim Kardashian
Woow
Omg,thank you <3
You're basically putting wax on your lips...
thanks for making that video because when i get older i can make my on lipstick
If I was a lesbian, I would marry you <3 YOU'RE SO PRETTY AND SO TALENTED! Are you a model or something? If you aren't, you should be!!!
Love this idea! How long does the color last on the lips? Does it fade or wipe away too easily?
my mum told me crayons have lead. even tho its non toxic theres still a bit of lead
Lol she talks so weird
Will this work with metallic crayons?
I'm definitely going to try this :)  Also , love your "candy corn" finger nails .
Actual video starts at 2:30  Just saying
How long does it last?
COOL!!! Hey did you do a video on how you did those amazing candy corn nails?
2:31 is the actual tutorial
the black suits you.
Can I use a normal oil? Please answer this easy-peasy question.... Please.
Uv your Neil's #candycane
Always something new!
What an excellent idea! Thanks for that! Will try it out. Saves me lots of money, non toxic and will be so fun to make!
it is not toxic? :\\ <3
It's toxic for lips
Can u microwave it
this is his friend that is a girl i loved the video but you put one of my favorite colors witch was pink but where is the green yo!! :}
Skip to 2:30 to pass the talking 😒
Say Selena Gomez 3 times  Repost this Then check your voice
Is that safe ??
Awesome! I am gonna try it
your voice is awful
how would i apply it? with my finger or can i grab the lipstick cube?
You are one big lier
Has anyone made any with Vaseline? Did it come out good? Cuz I have sum and. Don't wanna have to buy coconut oil...
OMG YOU LOOK LIKE LAURA MARANO!!
My question is what is the wear time on these? How long do they last, keep their color, etc? Both the wax and coconut oils have fairly low melting points, so I wonder about the quality.
You sound ratchet girl but I like u so respond back plz
Que es lo blanco q viertes ???
Can i use almond oil instead of the coconut oil?
Pretty cool video. :) Is there any specific brand crayons that should be used? Or any crayons could be used? Is it 110% safe?
Gdhhoky
Best DIY ever! I never really use my crayons for anything except homework. Now that I am growing up, I really do not use my crayons. I was trying to find a lipstick DIY, then I finally found a way to use them!!! Thanks so much Sofia!!!!! :)
How do I put it on
Can I use olive oil?
I subscribed because of this (: you're awesome :D
I'm surprised no one's asked this yet..but is it drying on the lips or does the coconut oil make it moisturizing?
Hey girls if you don't have coconut oil you could definitely use vaseline/petroleum jelly. It works just as good. I've tried it (:
You sound like Kim Kardashian.
You sound very familiar someone who is in a reality tv show but I don't know who but anyways I like your video you explained it very well
Can u read this
Sorry I did like it my name is tania bich
once, I put the mixture in plastic Easter eggs and used them for Easter
i love you
Really cool

How do you apply it? Do you take it out of the container? or do you get it on your finger?
Hey how did you make this video!?  (Like I mean the different clips and adding pics and stuff) Is it an app and if so, does it cost anything?
it works so good thx
I dont fully understand how to apply it to your lips. Do you let it dry? Or what...
Love your nails!
Hey guys were saying scary stories
Your voice gets on my nerves
Do you have any ideas on how to put it on a tube or something? Like a regular lipstick? Or does it have to be a jewel holder? Oh, and thanks for the video!
You can also mix crayons to get different colours than whats just in the box :) cool vid - can't wait to try this.
Lol
Lo
Thanks this was really helpful but ur intro was literally 2:30 long.
thanks!
YOU TALK ALOT UGHHH JUST START THE VIDEO !!!
Why did you crossout the blue
Crayons are actually not safe for your lips they may say non - toxic because you can have a skin reaction if you do not believe me then look it up on google are crayons safe for your lips? I found an article on Babble. I am not trying to be offensive SofiaStyled
I want to do this so bad I love lip sticks and eos lip balm and all those
She kinda looks like charli xcx with the black lipstick

How much chapstick?
Help, Everytime I tried to make this It came out hard as a crayon and would not go on my lips and i tried to heat it up to put it on and when it was on my lips it would not spread it went on very waxy and lumpy, what can I do to keep this from happening?
That is so cool. I never knew you could do this, but I think its really amazing. The colors also look amazing on you. :)
Ok thankyou
You remind me of Laura Mariano
Hi! love this idea, definitely gonna make a whole set lolz but i was wondering about how long it lasts on your lips and many times would you need to re-apply formula to your lips? :)
Do you have to put the oils in to make the lipstick
You talked a lot in the beginning of the video

Shame on you. A child in Africa could've eaten those crayons...

hey, i actually tried this with olive oil instead but when it hardened, it was really difficult for me to get it on my fingers, even the darker colours that were supposedly more pigmented. There were some colours that did get on my fingers but it wasn't as pigmented as shown in this video. It's so frustrating :-( any ideas on why it didn't work for me?
I love this
Love your voice x

You're soooo pretty! I love your eyes. :)

I love your voice :)
Why is everyone being so hateful about her voice?? I thinks she sounds  sweet an did spoken an caring. Why are there so many ride ppl on YouTube??

The 38th Kardashian kid
Hi! You answered some viewer that you were born and raised in LA. Have you ever spoken any other language as your native language or do you atm speak any other languages than English? It's just that you have an interesting accent. I doesn't sound typically Californian to me. I don't know if you're saying "until then" in the end but it sounds like "til thun" or something. This is purely out of curiosity and not to mock or anything.
Once it sets and drys completely  is it soft and usable ?
What if you don't have petroleum jelly??
The purple looks weird
This is cool I think I might try it
You just like ugly colors i liked the purple one the orange was ugly im not a a boy ima girl just using my brother's acaunt

Did you just say sheea butter it's shea spelt like shay
Do u have to use oils or can u just melt them on there own x
My glass bowl broke, which literally scared the hell outa me 😶
So..how safe is this? Crayola doesn't even list their ingredients on the webpage. It says I can have my doctor contact the poison control center for assistance in getting the ingredients. Um..POISON control? Why..if it's non-toxic? It contains paraffin wax..which has toulene and benzene...which are toxic and known carcinogens. It's small quantities..but if you're constantly wearing the lipstick, eating, rubbing your lips, licking..you're ingesting it and over time, consuming more than is safe. I just don't know if it's worth the risk. Even most lipsticks have chemicals known to cause cancer..and the natural ones still have things like carmine for coloring, which is crushed beetles. I have a known cockroach allergy..so I still have to be careful with "natural" products because I react to carmine with a rash. It's also in gummy bears, Dannon's yogurt and many other foods.
I am going to save so much money doing this and I will have so many colors I love having a variety of lipstick colors! thank u so much for your video! #subscribed!
Cool
You are darling! Great tutorial.
Can I use lipstick with crayons ?
Thanks for the tip. I have had to give up commercial lipsticks because of the lanolin in them.
Hi
This is so cool! I'm going to try it this weekend!
That's so cool. I want to try this now.
Nice tutorial! I found this to be very interesting...But ma'am you got hair on your chin.  Sorry.
If I were to use, say, 3/4 oil instead of 1/2 would it come out even lighter in color? I want to do this, but I personally dislike wearing  colors that show so much!
Cute nails
Hated this hope everyone sees not do it
BEAUTIFUL <3
Blah. You're voice is so monotone. It makes me want to sleep..i actually almost did. Sorry.
Can i use a baby oil?
This is really cool! How does it feel though? Like regular lipstick?
THAT WAS UGLY WHAT U DID IN THE STARTING OF THE VIDEO
Love your make up!
Thank so very much...I can never find different color lipstick now I can make my own....
Can you put in the whole crayon
ive been making crayon  lipstick for about a week now and i find like pinks and yellows dont really show up on you're lips and can get really  blotchy ..... Help!!!
cool
I think you are a life saver...
Thanks! This helps a lot!
What if I want it to be matte? Do I separately add baby pouder to my lips or is there anything that I could do to make it matte?
<3 *runs & grabs my niece crayon box* Lol!
Hey i ve tried using a different brand n not crayola it didn't work out its kinda hard n lampy on the lips....
Crayons ARE NOT safe to use on your lips, neither is Vaseline. They both contain by products of the petroleum (gasoline) industry. Coconut oil is great and for coloring use mica (Bare Minerals is made of mica and you can by plain mica in every color imaginable in almost every craft or art supply store.
Hello...its so amazing kind of talent u have pretty girl :) thanks alot for sharing this to us. Godbls u :)

I have tried the Vaseline and/or Petroleum Jelly. They do not turn out very well. Would you say the coconut oil would work better? Or the Vaseline. My mom insisted Vaseline, because the coconut oil was more expensive...but I use my finger to apply it. What do you use?
That is so cool

Wow! Cute idea!
Wow! Cute idea!
a bith fuck u wasting my time
Awsome
I think u look abit like ariana grande. For some reason.
If you live somewhere hot(or just in the summer) you might want something more stable than coconut oil. More stable options would be Shea butter, coco butter, bee wax, palm wax, soy wax. Pretty much anything that melts in heat, but will solidify back when out of the heat. I usually stick to pinksofoxy's lip balm recipe for many things.  She lives in Hawaii so she makes things that wont melt easily.  She pretty much does a mixture of bee wax, coco butter, Shea butter, even coconut oil all in moderation. I learned to be suspicious when people say to just use coconut oil in products and nothing more stable, all because I watched a video where someone just used coconut oil and a few powders to make deodorant. When I made it, the temperature was in the 90's so it was a fail.  I see a lot of people in the comments asking if the can use carrier oils(sunflower, olive, grape seed, almond etc) Ehhh...if you want something solid and live somewhere hot, and or want to actually put your lipstick in a classic tube container, I wouldn't risk wasting your stuff.
i didnt really like the last one sorry
Wow that's really creative and your super pretty
Talk too much
bandmire
Crayola crayons are non toxic, so nothing would happen even if you ate them -.-

Does it have it be a GLASS bowl
Cute
I think your video was very informative. However, my 7yr old son watched it yesterday, with me and He decided to get up and try it, while we were sleeping. He painted his whole body green! Thankfully he used the microwave and forgot the coconut oil step. But I thought other readers may want to know how to get the crayon off if this scenario happens to them. This is what the Crayola website says: How can I remove Crayola washable product stains from skin?  Although CRAYOLA washable products are water-based and designed to wash from skin and nearly all children's clothing, the dyes and pigments included in Crayola washable products react differently to various skin types, depending on a person's body chemistry.  Normally, Crayola washable products can be removed from the skin by washing with soap and water. If you are unsuccessful with soap and water, try using baby wipes, baby oil or make-up remover. Since Crayola washable products are water-based, you may find that keeping the area moist with water will help to lift the stain.  If you need further assistance, please call (800) 272-9652 weekdays between 9 AM and 4 PM Eastern Time and a representative will be happy to assist you.
I had to draw it on my lips
Crappy doe
so she could put it on me
wow im going to tell my sister to do it for me becuase she is 20 and i am only 9 so yeah
I would think after a while glass cld break
I really thank you very much served me and my friends
umm how do we know at the end your just applying the other colored makeup? what i mean is you do the steps then in the end you use real lipstick.... make a video showing proof!
Sofia can you use oils oil
Won't crayons darken lips or harm them in any way..? Even if they ain't toxic..
Y does she talk like that
You are good
I applied my lipstick while it was still hot and now my lips are fuller, thanks!
So cool can u do one on hair extension
I have one more question, and I can't seem to find a solid answer, are there other oils you can use, that work the same as coconut oil?
Can u use vegetable oil
How long does it last on your lips? Does it last longer, shorter, or about the same as regular lipstick?
Mine didn't turn out as good. I did everything you said
omg! i want to try this with a dark red, grey and black, looks so much fun!
Nao gostei das cores
I loved the idea . Thank you for sharing this grate grate vedio , no offense but you talk a lot . I like the purple on you it makes u look like lord the singer
This video was really helpful, thanks!
Do you have to use any oils
Can you use a glass cup??? Cuz. Don't have a mini glass bowl
I cant believe it
this was so cool :)
I loved my results, thanks
Can u use the whole crayon

Wait so can you use vegetable oil for this?

Your a fucking drama queen I hate ur voice
yay its cheap
How do you wipe it off?
I like your nails did u do them yourself?
She sounds like Miranda sings
2:31 for tortorial
The orange looks pretty on you and the black look good on you too
I personally think the orange looks really good on you and I used petroleum jelly instead of coconut oil and I found that it lasts a bit longer. Also if you put a paper towel over your lips and then put on a translucent powder over it, it will set the lipstick causing it to last longer and wont smudge as easily :)
OMG! Black looks soooo beautiful on you :)
Great tutorial!
That's amazing ! Cool  i love this video i watch this video everyday and i love you're voice!
It might be a stupid question but can you microwave it? x)
can you use it on the face as well?
i dont think this is safe because like what if you lick your lips and some of the crayon rubs off.
Your wierd
where did you get the storage and how much was it?
I mean... I don't use lipstick, but that's cool as fuck. My mom really appreciates these kinds of things and I'll be sure to show her!
Love it :)
Omg I really loved the lipstick made out of crayons
You have an very dry face lotion alert!!!!!!!!!!!

Our stove is not like in America cause were from the Philippines so when I boil it its like bubbling is it ok? Cause my mom thinks its dangerous that i use glass

Thank goodness my mom is a massage therapist. She keeps gallons of coconut oil in the house. Now I just need some crayon boxes and I'll be set! I love this video, simple and not much confusion. You answered my questions. Therefore you have a new subscriber and I'll be happy to watch more videos!

I am allergic to coconuts lol
LOVE IT!

For how long do you put it in the freezer.
This worked so well, but I had to make a few adjustments according to supplies I had. Here is the recipe. Ingredients: Crayola Crayon: Color of Choice Canola or Vegetable Oil Other Supplies: Small container  Directions: 1. Pour a small drop of oil into a glass bowl 2.Add an inch of a crayon into the bowl 3. Microwave the mix for a minute and a half 4. Pour the mix into the container 5. Let dry for five minutes  *NOTE: Moisturizes lips and non-toxic
U sound like Kim kardashian
Would it work with a white crayon?
I love your nails!!
Very good video. I loved it and it's so easy.
Would the crayon get dried on your glass bowl
U took 2 minutes and 45 secs u talked to !uch
I liked the purple and pink the most.
have you tried using this mixture as eyeshadow? if so, did it smudge? thanks miss
what two colors should i mix it with to make a loud color?
the orange looks great on you!! have you tried green?
The black kind of made you look like an older Wednesday Addams..idk... just my opinion. I liked it
Very beautiful and so cute
when you make it and then put it in the containor thingy say u want to use it days later will it become hard or nonreusable?
Indigo was the best to
Where did you get the coconut oil
what do you use to put it on though?
Love your hair
Very creative and good money saver ! I just updated my collection and got cheap lipsticks from walgreens ! Alot of people buy mac but it soo many cheap ways out there lol

It took to long to get to the point.
I mean obviously it does when it dries, but after it hardens you can't use it again right? Or you can...? I feel like this is a dumb question sorry lol
Thanks for the tips! I'm just getting into makeup sort of so this is pretty cool! Very helpful :D Does it all just harden after awhile?
What is the × for

LOVE.IT THANKS SO MUCH........
wouldn't this be dangerous/poisonous
can i use milk butter??
Is it toxic or poisonous because it is a crayon?
thanks works great
will this solidify enough so you could put it in an empty lipstick tube? because i have some lipsticks that i don't like the color of, and i was wondering if i could empty them out and put this in instead. :)
tried this!! Purples or blues or generally darker colours don't apply too well, kind of patchy, but pinks or rouges seem to work fine. Also, they start to melt if you leave them out in the open so keep in fridge!!! :)
What were those cross for
Why are you asking so much fvkpop
i would do this but my mom would never let me so
That's so cool
Glass*
In The Classic Bowl is there going to be water in that ?
How do you reheat the crayon?
Does it dry out? Do you have to continue to make it all over again to use it another time
Can I just say, that you are very pretty. I love how the braids look on you
Isnt that toxic??? :o...
so i had tons of fun making these for my wife -- i fiddled around with adding sparkles to some of them...we've been having fun trying them out  i store them in a product i found at a dollar store -- its a storage container made of 5 transparent bagel-shaped clamshells that are each divided up into 5 separate areas.  each of these clamshells stack atop each other on a central spindle  you can find them online (like here http://www.amazon.co.uk/Storage-Caddy-Stackable-Containers-Multi-functional/dp/B004J558GI) -- they are much cheaper at Dollarama, though :3
That's AWESOME!!!!
The orange and black looked gorgeous on you, especially with your pale skin. Do you think it would be okay to pour it into an empy lipstick or chapstick tube? Thanks for the great video.
Thanks, I try it, but where do we put it at, well it go bad?
It's awesome I tried it it work great!!!!
Can you get hurt by this
Can u use any brand of coconut extra virgin oil?

I love how your so kind with all of the rude comments.You are gorgeous and I love your voice
I would probably use this for cosplay, maybe not just for lipstick but for like face paint as well with the opaque recipe. I think its pretty helpful as strange as it sounds/seems. :) Thanks Sofia you just earned a new subscriber!

Please answer me as soon as you can :)
Sofia styled sorry if I spelled your name wrong but you were totally rocking the lipstick and how do you put it on :/
Not bad but how do you put it on if it's still hot :/
is this safe???
you kinda sound like emma watson when she was in the perks
That's creative and you just gave my six year old an idea on how to use her crayons. She have a fascination with make-up. Keep up the great work.
I like your vitoes
Yes tried it it worked yay
Coconut oil melts at around 76 degrees, I believe. Does the crayon wax help it to not melt at such a low temp after it's mixed and hardened? I have a bunch of little empty lipstick containers, and I would love to be able to take some out with me, but I would hate for it to melt and leak in my bag!   Awesome DIY! Thanks for sharing!
PLEASE REPLY!! can u put a pinch of glitter in there to make it glittery?
if you don't have a oven safe bowl do u think i should buy 1 or do u think that it is safe to use a normal bowl

Is It Necessary To Take CRAYOLA?
I've got a question - but I'm not sure if you answered it in the video or not, so I'll go ahead and ask; will you "lipstick" eventually harden once more, or will it stay in a liquid-like state?
Thanks! I am going to use this so much!
What if we don't put coconut oil
omg your voice too funny!
This is super cool! One question though. What about the amount of lead in those crayons, is it not unsafe?!
Wow your very pretty and I love your eye lashes!! :D
Does it ruin the bowl you use it in
So cool
odes it ever harden . if so how do you put it on
I like pink
That does not work guys ok
Did she pour the lipstick in a loom band tray because it looks like it
The violet color looks so good on you, I just wanted to say that because you looked kinda unsure about it, but it really does!!
does it come off easily???
I love you
i like it SofiaStyled
You are lady gaga
It was great to see this video pretty

Been wanting to make my own colors of lip gloss.  Thank you for your video!
Do you absolutely have to use the coconut stuff?

hi girl
Where did you buy coconut oil at ?
So surprised at how pretty the orange came out!

u talk like miranda sings

You sound like you were having a cold ...
Would that work with oil pastels? I have tons of them, including non-toxic ones, lying around the house, it would be nice to finally put them to a good use!
It great I am going to try it!!!!
She is like a real Miranda Sings
Just use Vaseline && whatever color kool-aid you want
She talks for a really long time
my mother told me i wont follow u cause its toxic.
that is so amazing cool and awesome i really love it
WOW!!! You are such a little cutie!!! What an amazing idea, I would have never thought of this, I love it!!!! PS - Love your nails  PSS - Great presentation, very impressed.  Thank you for this wonderful idea!
Hi just wanted to say that I tried veggie oil and it works too! I did red and holy crap I never looked prettier
you sound like a kardashian!
will it ruin the glass
lol just keep the natural look.... its better on you
Hi I'm a new sub :3
Omg sooooo cool I am totally doing this!!!!!!!! : )
Great idea i will try it but do they harden in the container?
Instead of coconut oil, can i just shave off some EOS lipbalm? Like 1/2 inch like the video says and follow all the steps though? Would that make a big difference, I have no idea where to find coconut oil and don't really have any money anyways.
Does it dry ?
If you hate it why do you watch it your dum not her
why talk sow at the beginin
Don't they dry up ????
I like your nails :):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)::):):)):):):)::):)::)

Is there some way that you can make the lipstick shine?
she talks to to to much i cut it off
so u can use peroleum to subsitute
This sounds really fun to me, someone who loves colors and crafting and makeup and and drawing, all that jazz. But Id rather stick with a normal lip balm or a decent lipstick. Eating crayon is not my hobbie. Well I would try making these but to use them on a daily basis? Nahhhh.
Can i used petroleum jelly instead of coconut oil?
Thanks hun, much love, wolfy Namikaze
U went on babbling for 2:31 I feel asleep then
can we just put it in hot water with no oil
Do you have to put the coconut oil
Can these be used as face paint too, or would they stain the face, like regular lipstick?
you looked like Lorde with the darker lipstick, cool tutorial.
Lipstick companies hate this video.
you talk to much
Orange is pretty
Your voice is so annoying ...
What app do you use for making these amazing video?
Can you tell me what kind of crayons would be suitable?( Because there's too many kinds of crayons, and some do not have safe ingredients)  Sorry that my English is not very well.  Thanks a lot :)
Does it dry or flake when it's on your lips ?
1.Do I need to use coconut oil? 2.How did you apply it? 3.Do I need to have that special crayons? 4.After applying can you smell coconut oil on your lips? please answer!
I think its a bit dumb using crayon im not hating or anything i loved this video its just if ur gonna kiss a guy and when u kiss him hes not really gonna like the taste of crayon and its not very nice having a taste of crayon lol
her voice annoys me..
Don't. Link so much please it's actually really! Annoying!
You have amazing eyebrows.
Is it vegan friendly?
Wow
Can u use veg oil
Cool
Nice!
makes it what if you do not take the coconut convincing?
what about red, brown, grey, white,  rainbow, and, yellow????????
Also, it doesnt make much sense to me that you have to use MORE oil to get an opaque look. Plus she put more oil in, and got a sheer look. It makes NO sense..
Her voice... im gonna have to watch this on mute. Lol
Awesome!:)
Ive made this and it never works after about 5 minutes after you pour it into the cup. (When its Finished)
Wow. It actually works!!
Wene I tryed this my friend triped me and it burned all my skin

SofiaStyled will this DIY damage the glass bowls?

The black color made you look goth, aha
Does it make ur lips crack??? Everytime I use lik covergirl or maybelline my lips crack. Then I have to buy expensive mouistrizing lipstick because drugstores dnt do good for my lips
I used vaseline, veggie oil, and crayons instead ^^ This is awesome. I made dark green and orange because they looked fun :D
It was grate
can you do it with oil
Did the crayon harden overtime and does the crayon smear easily on your lips? And thanks for the video. I liked that u showed what a few of the colors would turn out to look like.

this is the coolest thing!  do u freez it?  how long does it last?

I just had to say this... and not in a rude way...  A box of crayons threw up on your face   >, < sorry just had to
Is it for one time use or can it be stored away? & how?
Awesome :)
This is really neat! Unfortunately, I am the weirdest person on earth and am allergic to coconut. Have you tried any other ingredients instead of coconut oil, and if so, which ones give the best results? Thanks!
Yo if I ever found out I made out with someone that had crayon lipstick I would feel like a fucking kindergartner eating glue and crayons and shit.  What the fuck.
Am I the only one that thinks she sounds like Miranda Sings?
I used it as war paint
how do you put it on your lips, do you just take like your finger and dip it in
Is this real
can the oil not be solid like if I used olive oil?
the reason why i don"t like this video because you took long woman
:o i luv this video i used it its amazing u get amazing ideas
Any Other Oil I could use?
You talk too much
Next time make white
You can just buy lip stick. And plus if you by cocoanut oil you have chap stick
To cool
wowww i love it
thx
The violet and orange really suits you! c:
Do you know the substances that make crayons are there any chemicals in those?
can u use partolium jelly insted of coconut oil?
Love it but in the small bowl do u add water or just coconut oil? Is it safe could u use it again? What if ur lips turn into a rash? Help I want to try this but I'm scared
I don't get it. Are you supposed to apply it while it's still hot? And how do you reuse it? Cuz the box will melt if you reheat it, right?
It doesn't look nice .. But gud job anyways ..the colour is not strong
i love the black on you!!! the black just fits you because your hair is black
Awesome

Are they toxic.?.
Hey Lovelies..  I think it's great that people can find their own ways to make cosmetics cheap. However... I really don't want to be a downer but I feel responsible to tell you guys some really important stuff.... Just because something says non toxic- doesn't mean it's non toxic in the long term --- Artificial Dyes have long term health hazardous effects.. Countless studies have been done on this.. even and especially artificial food dyes!! And although they are on the market still.. they shouldn't be! Here are some of the things artificial dyes can link to : “Studies have linked artificial dyes to behavioral problems such as ADD/ADHD and hyperactivity, as well as allergic reactions, brain cancer, tumor growth, cell deterioration, nerve and organ damage, birth defects, and uncontrolled cell mutation,” says Dr. Lipman. “CBS News reported that certain children diagnosed with ADHD may not need medication if artificial dyes were removed from their diets!” ^That was taken from http://www.refinery29.com/2013/08/51056/food-dye-brain-cells this site just for an example but you guys should google artificial food dye hazards etc.. I can only imagine what dyes go into crayons. http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/01/16/new-fear-about-food-dyes/  Good luck guys and by the way, always try to go for Organic and chemical free products as it helps to keep the body healthy and Anti-age rather than age the cells way beyond their years!!
MY LIPS ARE STUCK BLUE NOW THX A LOT JERK

Added this video to my computer book marks. This will be SOO useful knowing that most lipsticks have led, and crayons are non-toxic! This is so cool!
Muy Buena ydea grasias

Thank you for all your Videos!!! check out my NEW  how to lip video Tutorial on my Easy Lip Stick Look    http://youtube.com/beautynwisdom
how long does it stay on your lips? :)
Your pretty! :D
so how do you apply it to your lips
Does this wear off quickly?
candy corn!!!
i dont have coconut oil, is it safe to use vegetable oil?
i love your candy corn nails
SofiaStyled  can u use Vaseline instead
I used everything in this video exept I melted the coconut oil in the microwave for 1:30 seconds.
Looks cool, but is it healthy?
I got a couple questions; my sister wants a deep crimson red lipstick that is similar to Milani's Red Velvet, do you have a combo I can use to achieve that. What do you recommend to use instead of coconut oil, she's allergic.
love the lipstiks
I WANT A BLUE ONE SO BAD AND U HELPED ME OMG IM GONNA BUY U DIAMOND DX THANK U
Is this Healthy??
Gained a new subscribe♡
i used the microwave and then it hardendend and i also used vaseline :( but thanks for the DIY!
I tried this (with vaseline) and when the lipstick had set, it was so hard I couldn't put any on! Do I need to use more vaseline?
Wouldn't the crayon mix get hard and stiff in a while?
It's toxic?
Would it be okay to mix 2 colors?
um.. i have a question. is it safe?
Do you need to have coconut oil
Do u tink waring wax on ur lips is apropreaat
great tutorial! I'll make sure to try this!
I am a guy, but why does this video make me want to make lipstick? i'm so confused...
This is going to sound pretty dumb but, can I use the twistables instead of the crayons?
You talk too much... no ofence
I thought that was a good idea but I would of made mine more glossy
I have a question, does the lipstick adventually dry and u can never use it again?
It works I did it and I didn't use a pot i use warm water in a pot and put the bowl in the warm water :D!
Cool
Crayons cause cancer
I love ur nails in this vid
wow stupid
How about I don't have cocoanut oil in our house and I'm so lazy to go buy it what can we use.
That's a great idea but to be honest, lipstick just works better. It applies more evenly, it doesn't take as long, lasts longer, it's convenient and since I'm a dude and I only need black for my vampire costume in October, I think I'll just grab a tube instead...
nice .. i love the idea.. saves money
If you used coconut oil that is already a liquid ( sorta like a maple syrup consistency ) would you be able to use that too?
I'm so trying this!
My two friends and I tried it- perfect. We stole some old sprinkles jars from my kitchen. They had lids and everything. Also, a tip for when it dries out: put a few drops of warm water and SHAZAAM.
Can I use pastel
You just earned a new subscriber? Sub for sub?
Why do you smile like that omg makes want to throw up
good idea, but do you know what these crayons are made of? lipstick and other cosmetics arent just tested for fun i guess. some crayons contain fluoride or mercury or other heavy metals which are dangerous to human health at any dose! shocking to realize that children nowadays play with poison.
Do I just dip your ginger in and apply it to your lips?
Where do u put the melted crayons after u put them on your lips
FFS girl...stop the yap yaping..get on with it
I like how the orange looks on you! Its so pretty

My name is Leslie cutey
I love it Sofia
In our country we don't have coconut oil what else I can use instead? ?
Isn´t it unhealthy? :)
I think her voice is nice
Can I use olive oil for the mixture? I'm from Catalonia, so from the mediterranean zone and here we use olive oil all the time and for all and would be more easy for me, more practic.
2k people are jealous
It's not her voice, it's the way she talks
I heard using old chapstick instead of oil makes it smoother.
your wierd
I actually liked listening to your voice. lol
I LOVE your nail polish!!!
Oh! Is a nice idea, but isn't toxic if my boyfriend kiss me? XD hehehehe Is only a question :3 thanks for the video and cool nails ^ ^'
I like your nails
You say black like block
Haha my b-day is on this day
you talk too much before you do it
People these days.. =.= She can't control how her voice sounds, and she obviously can't change her voice too even if she forces herself to; her voice just sounds like that, and if you can't bear with it, don't watch the video. Why would you watch a video just to post a hate comment on it? Jeez, be more matured please, haters. .-.

2:31 skip intro
Jenny crombie she couldn't chose what her voice will sound like what if people thought ur voice is annoying what would u say?
Hot water or cold water
You talking alot
Nice Vid I'll try it out

I use to smear crayons on my lips all the time when I was younger to make it look like I was wearing lipstick. im surprised that you can make like a gloss with it XD
I like your hair Sofia
Love yo nails
where do you put it to change texture just lay it out in room temperature
I love you videos
Don't make this in a white glass bowl
Instead of using the glass bowl could you just use a double boiler?
Dont listen to all the annoying people commenting. I actually think you have a really nice voice like a southern-belle.
awsome
Do u have to use oil
Were do you get coconut oil
Can someone tell me whether you have to use coconut oil or whether you can use something like olive oil or another oil :) Thanks!
I realy like the purple lipstick.
not to sound rude but your voice is really annoying
colorful
Can you use an oil other than coconut?
the black one makes her look like a witch..lol..but still pretty
Wow you're pretty. #Pretty :)
I noticed you respond to your subscribers and its really cool and unique that you do that
Do a eos lip balm video
Omg hey this is not my account but I was wondering if u could show red lipstick and that's really pretty!!(;
I don't like it I luv it
:p:)
I have tons of crayons so it will great to use some crayons up
wont this kill you if you lick it accidently
i love your nails

witty
How neat!! You can mix colours to come up with your own unique colours!
Really annoying voice
Omg your voice is so annoying
Man I don't have a jar right now.... And  i have everything! What else can I use? Because I really want to try it out tonight or tomorrow.
That black goes good with your hair
Your really pretty and I love your nails and make up!
Lml @ 5:23 it said "negro" under "black"  (Don't try to get offensive and stuff, I'm black as well. So yea) c:
Isn't this dangerous? Cause i loved it and i wanna try it hahaha! God bless you:)
im getting worried! i wanna do it but does it damage your lips because people are saying it does! oh well you look dead gorgeous with all of them and i love your voice i wish i had it <3
Thank you for sharing this awesome tutorial as well as your advice. Hope your getting over your cold.  I can't wait to start blending colors for my lips & my daughters & friends today! Allthough I'm not so sure anything labeled Non Toxic truly is anymore, even for our precious children sadly. Look what they spray in our air that each of us breath.  I am pretty darn sure THIS IS A MUCH SAFER OPTION  than most of the cosmetics we all buy & consume. Even of you don't lick your lips I would hope someone is kissing them =) give them safe kisses in return! How sad to think there are so many rude people that would actually take the negative time & energy to say such rude things to such a beautiful, kind person. Didn't anyone else teach their kids.... OF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY  (STFU!) DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL UNLESS ASKED!  There is an option to go to the next video. Some of  you seem either  unaware or more consumed by negative rude energy rather than kind constructive criticism?  Thanks again for sharing!
I love the pink lipstick!
is it safe if you lick it? cos i mean its on ur lips so thats kinda inevitable ahaha
you should mix them next time
يعع قهرتيني وانتي تتكلمين كيذا ترفعين الضغط و منعمة صوتك ياا دلعوعة  ايععععع
why did yo put an x
Does she have a cold? Her voice tho
you talk too much,, it would have been better if you proceed to the tutorial .
Can I apply it as eyeshadow or eyeliner?
Crayon is toxic
Such a nice clear tutorial and talk. I can listen to you all day. Youhave a beautiful voice and a great calm energy!
but know you have wax on you lips and wax drys and hardens
'yawn' you talked for 2 mins and 30 secs!!! its about how you do it......
Good video but uuuggghhh her voice is killin me lol
Hi! Does anyone know Crayons lipstick can also being use for face paint? Will it feel discomfort on the face?
If you don't feel like making it, Hot Topic sells some odd lipstick colors (I know because I wear black when I perform, I'm a lead guitarist for a metal band)
You should of did green
One of the most amazing things I've seen in a while. Very cool.
I love this video! Can you use vegetable oil instead of coconut?
wouldnt the glass bust if its in water and heat ?
she talk too much but sweet
u know some kids that had eaten crayons got cancer so if we lick our lips after puting the lipstick on we might get cancer im not doing it :S
and... she was blinking sooooo much
she sounded like she just had a nose bleed a now she was trying to not have it again (thats what i think) but i love the idea of crayon lipstick if u lick it will something happen to u?
FAST FWD TO 2:32 FOR THE POINT OF THE VID... WELCOME
I love your nails
This is so awesome!!!😋
Kind of like Kim Kardashian voice...
Yet u can put crayons on ur lips but yet u can't EAT CRAYONS 😫

It's interesting to see what people do ;) I would never dare! :-p
Where can you get that container? Thx
Your voice annoyed me
This is so cool
Thank you for posting this!  I found your instructions very easy to follow.  The product turned out perfect!  Much appreciated!  XD
Your voice sounded different when you were talking over the DIY as opposed to you talking at the beginning of the video. Idk why.
Where do you get coconut oil

Love your nails!!!!
Am I the only one who thought she sounded it Miranda sings??

I like it I tried it it was fun
Your voice is incredibly annoying
Im wiondering if this will work with soy crayons, im allergic from regular crayons
Once you take the crayon mixture out of the pan is it safe to put it in a lip stick thingy that's cleaned out or is it going to burn it?
Wow, this is great! If you don't want to spend on expensive cosmetics and lipstick, this is a good way to recycle used crayons at home. Very creative!
Goth lips suit you so well! If you decided to be goth you could pull it off!
i'm going to see if the yellow works
Don't crayons have toxic ingredients? I'm just wondering if this is safe.

That is not normal
Day makadaot ba nag lips?
Yesss! Im a makeup artist and I do lots of Halloween looks. This is just perfect for my projects thanks :)
that was awesome
Starts at 2:32 :)
2:30 video starts, your welcome!
I followed your directions exactly, I even had your video propped up as I was doing it. I went for a more opaque look and the only one that sort of turned opaque, was the red color. The other ones crumbled on my lips and had no pigment whatsoever. What could I have done wrong?
u talked 4 half of the video
It is so cool 😉
i love the dark one ur really pretty
hello lipsticks good bye crayons
U kinda remind me of mirandasings. I guess ur voice.
Thank you!!!
violet, orange, and black are my favorites.
Okay I have a stupid question. I am not really a makeup loving girl(which is why I really like your video!) so I have no idea about removal or anything....can this be washed off with water?
Doesn't it harden
I LOVE YOUR NAILS SOOOOO CUTE
i think you should have searched the internet about the toxicity of crayons, before you just say these words! in general most crayons have too much of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and these are carcinogenic! Furthermore many crayons consist of aniline and these are a heavy blood gas. If I were you, i would never say things, i'm not 100% positive about! Think about the kids watching your video and do the same because they trust your words! you're irresponsible...﻿
Nikki Haydens how about you shut up
Can you use olive oil?
this may sound really wird but you have REALLY pretty lips. :)
The blue and purple look like she's been eating tongue painter sweets!
can i use cooking oil? :)
Such a cool idea I love it! :)
Don't it dry tho
What happens if it dries on your lips ?
After placing in the container, are the crayon solutions still in liquid form? Or did it solidify? Thank you
Is it safe for lip?
Great idea the orange is different but I really like it
1Just like making chocolates!!
lana del rey? .__.
So after melting the crayon with the oil you would just let the crayon dry in the box compartment and apply it as lipstick?
Can someone tell me if instead of using coconut oil could u use vasiline
Ghhhhhhhbjjhbh
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS THEY ARE SO COOL
can you use metalic crayola crayons?
SofiaStyled: Extraordinary Channel & Videos
is it safe?
I am so gonna try that!
Omg
You can pull of purple very we'll!!!
The orange complements your eyes
Wow, this is very neat! I can't wait to try it. Question though, does the shade of the color effect how dark or light it will be on your lips? I'm asking because the pink crayon looked very neon but once you put it on you lips, it looked lighter in color.
Ur so pretty and I love your genorous attitude follow me YouTube page and my face was orange pretty girl
the orange looks BEAUTIFUL on you!
might try thx
after it dries in the compartment thingy, do uu like, have to add water or something to use it again or do u like, have to repeat the operation of making the lipstick?
You look good in the lipstick colors.
cute and smart! congratulations!
Mines didn't work :(
i love your eye makeup, do you have a tutorial?
thxx it really worked I am rockin my blue lipstick
Can you add vanilla extract and vasaline in the lipstick?
Great video but your voice annoys me sorry if I'm coming of mean😳😳😳😳
I'm trying to do this today , you are very pretty !
Amazing, thanks!
If I were to use peppermint oil, is it the same measurements as the coconut oil?
What do u do when it drys
this is so cool omg xD
This was a really cool lipstick video
Go Girl!
Can you make matte lipsticks from crayons as well?
this video inspired me to wear crayon lipstik thnx for uploafing
Wow so fab and bold gurlllll
All of its pretty :}
It's a great video and good tutorial.. Butyour voice is mind numbingly annoying
Awsome
Hey I was wondering where can I buy the coconut oil??
This is an amazing method for me to use as I run out of lipstick all the time.the black and the pink looked really nice on you btdubs
It looks nice though.
This is SO dangerous.
Does olive oil work?
I think this video is good. But the start out to a good video doesn't consist of tons of talking
this is awesome
U talk a lot
so does the lip stick have to be dry to use?
Where I live, it is unusual to find coconut oil. What can I use instead of coconut oil?
It REALY worked I made a blue one thx lol xxx
Wat if u have no cooconut oil
I don't have coconut oil so if you do, do you have any other suggestions?
You're pretty :D
excuse me, um what else could you use instead of coconut oil? because im allergic to coconuts.. :/
awesome ican make my own lipstick i dont have one
I love your eye make up!
Yeah that's a smart idea.
Can I use a substitute for the coconut oil or do I have to buy coconut oil? Because I don't have coconut oil st all....
Omg this  video is amazing i really liked it its soo creative  i love it guess i am not buying more lipstick 👄
This is super neat. But once the crayon lipstick dries in the container will it still go on using a lip brush or your finger or does it harden and need to be moisturized with water or something?
Can I use Vaseline
What can u use if u don't have coconut oil?
you left a candle burning in your living room make sure you dont burn your house down! lol
im going to make millions
Omg she sord of looked like wednesday when she put the blabk lipetick on^U^
Phoebe Tran  haahah how awesome
Can I use petroleum jelly?
can you use it wile its cold after?
Amazing quality of the lipstick!
i so wanna try this this looks so cool
Does it have to be coconut oil?
Does it stain the cup? Like say if I want a pink one, would it stain the small bull? I'm just wondering.
and the orange looked really good on you the darkness of the shade was really nice with your hair color and all!
I fricken love your eyebrows!
I'm just wondered can we use vegetable oil?
not bad
You're so gorgeous. And all the colors literally look so good on you.
Always wanted to try this...
Wouldn't the wax harden after a while though so it would have to be one time use?
In a loving teachers input honey it is pronounced like Shay with a long A sound not SHE-Ah
You are pretty
I like the orange and the pink one
can you tell me where 2 get these supplies from

I really hate the way she talks
Can you use vanilla extract or almond extract?
So... Make a double boiler and mix non-toxic crayon and coconut oil to a desired consistency... That's pretty simple...
I luv ur nails
what can you use if you don't have coconut oil
I made these yesterday...and to my surprise..they smell like crayons..and I used vanilla for smell and it still smells like crayons...so I don't want to use crayons..will try the eyeshadow.

Can I use Vaseline then Shea butter and coconut oil? Cuz I have to make this for a party
One quarter not fourth
How do you get it out of the thing
i love your nails
Crayons are made out of wax, but it is still safe to use it as lipstick. You can use olive oil instead of coconut oil. You can mix petroleum jelly or vaseline. You can also mix some normal lip balm(you cut them like the crayon) if you don't have vaseline; actually you mix vaseline to prevent your lips from drying. Hope this helps!
Do you have to use an oil? And can it be a liquid oil?
Omg this worked out perfectly I love it thx :)
Can the glass bowl break in the pot ?
does it come off DX
What other oils can you also use
so ur just melting cryons in coccuntut oil. wow
Amazing... How on Earth did you come up with this? :-O

I have the same glass bowl
The orange is nice too
I made a green one
Do u need to put coconut oil into the mixture
Do you have to use the coconut oil? Or could you use other oils like olive oil, or peppermint oil?

First, your so cool. I loved this idea sooo much, but all the tutorials used like 3 to 6 ingredients.  Until yours....... I used 2 parts pink and one part white crayon. Added a pinch of ultra fine gold "dust" and it came out soooo pretty, like a dusty pink. Thanks for the video!! P.s. mine is very much lip gloss, id like to make my other colors more like lipstick, any hints?
Talks to much in the beginning

can you use vasiline or patrlieum jelly in sub as cocunut oil
This crayon lipstick is actually safer than the store bought lipsticks. If i do recall correctly, store bought lipsticks can contain magnesium sulfide and other things you wouldn't want to ingest on a regular basis. Since Crayola is non-toxic, no matter the amount of "lead", it shouldn't be harmful whatsoever.
I love ur vids! You go gurl!
Beacause the video halfway stopped ?
How do you exactly make it ? It 's so detailed.. I think it will urn out great(although I haven't tried
you talk to much. skip to 2:30...
Great tutorial btw! Lol
What ingredient can I use to get it to be matte?
She used to much coconut oil and she should have put in some vaseline.
wowwwwww
I like your nails
I'm sorry, but just because most crayons are non-toxic, it does not mean that you should eat it or put it on your lips, where you'll inevitably ingest it. Come on, people. use common sense.
What is your name ?
considering we eat our lipstick when wearing it, how is this safe?
Wow

Something I found out while making lipstick using a similar tutorial I found on tumblr: A really easy way to clean the crayon mixture out of the bowl is to wait a little while for the bowl to cool down slightly and use a paper towel
I like the orange purple and black

This is such a cool video! Please subscribe to my channel to see my videos!
Love
This is too cool! I have a few questions, though. Is this easy to remove? Also, does it stain lips? Lastly, how does it feel on the lips? I imagine it would be pretty drying, so a balm may be necessary; then again, there is coconut oil in it. I'd love to try this! Thanks!
this is cool but you should make a video on your eye makeup its really cute
It works perfectly but I was laughing and it some how got in my mouth😂 so now a piece of what think is crayon it somewhere iny stomach😷

You are so lucky! EVERY colour lipstick looks stunning on you. :)
Aww ur candy corn nails r super cute
I tried it and it actually worked I did it in Vaseline though I love all your videos!(:
The orange looks really good on you! x
You realize that crayons are rated nontoxic for one-time accidental ingestion, not a continuous ingestion over a long period of time.  There are metals and minerals that can be toxic if ingested over long periods.
lot of effort too :)
Cool video. Amazing idea. Thanks a ton for sharing such a wonderful video. :-)
You can also use almond oil instead of coconut oil
oh therz nothing to be kind in that.... I just speak the truth...  :D :D :D :D
apres, that's a really cool option. mek mek linum@ vor ko uzats guyna ches ktnum. thanx so much.
Looks great! I'd love to try this;there's so many fun lipsticks I see from specialty brands that are kind of expensive (like Lime Crime for example),& before I spend $16 plus shipping I'd like to see how certain colors would look. I mean, black is easy enough cause you can always just use a cheap black eyeliner, but I'd love to try that orange like you had, or grey or blue! Where'd you get the little storage container?
Orange color looks so pretty *-*  very nice video :D
I don't understand why you made a tutorial video because you saw a tutorial video.. whats the point of making it if it already exists...
Omg really
this was very cool. ill probably try this out next time i have a sleepover with the girls
Are those nails a cutepolish design!
Omg lol you talk like such a white girl but nice video :D
You wear colors so well. Warm and cool. Wow.
#hi  #saving money
Do u think it can work with vaseline+crayons?just idea

What do you do when it dries up? Does it dry up.
Yaaaaaaaay now I can get orange lip stick that I sent expensive xD
The orange is lovely, it really pops :)
Omg...YOUR NAILS :o
can you also make a blushh out of this ?
Do you put it in the freezer? Or does it "freeze" itself?
I love your nails! I did Candy Corn nails myself last Halloween! http://sakura-courage-solo.deviantart.com/art/Candy-Corn-408685606
If instead of coconut oill i put castor oil ? Will it still work? Please someone answer ! :)
I feel like with the black lipstick you'll probably need to use a lipliner to make it stick and to make it more vibrant.
great :)
How long does the lipstick last?
Look how cool! We need to do this!
Nice job !
omg thanx im gonna make this
Love the orange and the black. With the black lips and braids you look like a pretty wednesday adams, LOVE!

If you have an empty lipstick case or lipbalm case; pour it in there!
Wtf?
Your voice is annoying. But good stuff tho
@Friederike Kressmann Crayola is not necessary I used a set of really cheap set of crayons I got in an art set, but I don't think they work as well as crayola which tend to be the better quality crayons
Do you have to use Those crayons or are there just some ingredients that are better or doesnt it matter ?
Black REALLY suits u!
AWESOME!!!

Oh my gosh I've never seen you before and you are absolutely gorgeous.
You are so very pretty.  You also have a very calm, soothing voice.  I bet young children would love to listen to you read them stories for hours on end.  Great idea and thanks for sharing.  I never thought of using the coconut oil and I have that in my pantry.  Guess what I will be doing soon?  Have a great new year and thanks again.
No offence but she sounds like a Kardashian
Very cool! Do they tend to have a sticky or smooth texture? Thx. xx

Hi....does this feel smooth on your lips??
Love ur intro girl!:) and nice idea! I have alot of un used and broken crayons and have no idea what to do with it, and im really cheap when it comes to lip products :))
Nice video i fell in live and suscribed awsome work
it worked thank you :)
You might want to google color theory to learn more accurate ways of making a shade lighter or darker. Using white or black isn't going to give you the color you expect. Just a MU tip!
thx
hey can u use vegetable oil
Is there a way I can do this without using cocoanut oil?
Also by the way, I felt like you connect more with youtubers because of the way you talked and acted. You talk more on a personal level which is very hard to come across anymore. I am extremely blown away! 100% great video! I loved every second of it!
OMG! You're SO pretty! I love your videos! Great Job! Well explained!!
Can you use petroleum jelly for this?

Looks like candy corn nails
Can use anything else instead of coconut  oil
such a beautiful nails
very cool! does it like dry out or harden, separate etc. after storing for periods of time? or does it keep well?
you can see on her lips its has a crayon effect example if you go out side and draw on a piece of paper on the concrete it has those gaps to fix this put 1 table sp of shea and some extra virgin olive oil (choose you own amount depending on how much you will make the more you make the more shea you put in the ix and the less oil you put in the mix) this will take longer to set but a better wear and it wont effect how sheer or full you want the colour.
Non-toxic does NOT equal safe for skin as a cosmetic. Please educate yourself before poisoning the public. "• An art material is “nontoxic” if a toxicologist paid by the manufacturer decides it is safe. The dramatic failure in this labeling procedure was illustrated with the lead ceramic glazes and asbestos-containing materials such as talc. Asbestos-containing talcs are still found in some art and craft materials today. • Some art materials that have never been evaluated by a toxicologist may be labeled “nontoxic” illegally due to weak enforcement of the art materials labeling law. For example, in 1995, a cameraman and a reporter from Channel 9 in New York went with me to a major art materials outlet. That night on the evening news, we showed viewers about a dozen imported products that did not conform to the law, some labeled “nontoxic,” which were being sold illegally. This is still true today, and a little research will lead you to many sources of non-compliant “nontoxic” products. • There is no regulatory requirement to warn consumers about damage to most of the body’s organs, such as the lungs, the liver, and the kidneys. Only four types of chronic hazards are covered by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act regulations. These are cancer, and developmental, reproductive, and neurological damage."

Can I use vegetable oil instead of coconut?
This is great and super affordable ^^ i had almost all the ingredients anyway. Yes!!
Wouldn't it be cheaper to just but wet n wild for 1-3$ than to buy all the ingredients? Lol
i liked the orange too
I just did this, except i used vasiline, and it turned out well. I really loved the pink and the orange colors i made. :)
black lipstick suits you soo much
You are so sweet
i use one tesp of coco butter two tesp of olive oil and half the crayon then i pour into a empty chapstick contaner cause its easyer to put on and it darkens the coloer making it look like revlone only it last longer
LOVE the nails! <3

Can you use vanilla essence?

@Dottie Hessel, well, yes it does. I made lipstick before, but the ingredients were different: Olive oil Petrolrum jelly Crayons (of course) & that was all
you should do a make up video instead of a DIY
What about when it dries out? Any way to reuse it?
would it work if u used vasoline/petroleum jelly and vegtable oil? i really want to try this, plz respond!!
Great tutorial! I'm allergic to coconut and almond and other variations of nuts, do you know what alternative oil I could use instead please?:)

Doesn't the crayons dry up after you pour them into the containers? Do they get hard? How does it stay soft enough to apply?
