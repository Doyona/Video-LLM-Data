Wow...(Berlinie Gucor)
My 1 last brain cell be working hard to understand this video
I always avoided diets because I thought I wouldn't be able to eat pizza or pancakes. Diet plan I got from Agoge Diet allows me to have cheat meals and still keep my fitness journey on track. If you don't believe me, visit their site and try it yourself.
In single night! I mean seriously, bad joke
I usually have either Cottage cheese or cream of wheat before bed!  This sounds interesting
I know one thing. I won’t be drinking this again. I cant get the cucumber and lemon taste out of my mouth.
I've been drinking  this one week already haven't  noticed any changes and I'm constipated  for some reason  b4 I would  use the toilet  as I wake up since  I'm drinking  this I dont use toilet  a whole day and i still do my exercises
I LOST 40lbs!!! You ask how? I visited website called Agoge Diet. I selected only food I like and they provided me with DIET MEAL PLAN, TRAINING PLAN, FITNESS TIPS and HEALTHY RECIPES.

Add some fruit to it, to your pleasure, and for me it makes it tolerable to drink. Lol
I was skeptic about Agoge Diet because I thought that I would have to eat only broccoli to lose weight. I am eating only food I like and still losing weight.
As I started following diet and training plan from "Agoge Diet", I took my confidence to the next level. Girls finally started noticing me.
The real video starts at 4:13 :)

I noticed my weight dropped in about 3 weeks. This with my diet got me out of my diet gridlock. I add an avocado and it makes it taste better.

Who else just checking the comments before they waist their time...  😆🤣🤪
Is it good for 5 to 10 year old kid
If you are wanting to find out the list of ingredients of this drink, you will find it at the 9 minute mark.
Get to the point already!
Far out, this video waffles on!
Do you drink this drink (1 glass), as a replacement for dinner, or after dinner?  If after dinner, how much later?  How long before i go to bed?   How many days in a row do you drink this?   And for how long -- do you just keep drinking it at night every night for the rest of your life, or just try it for, say, 1 month, and then stop, at least for a while?
How much of each ingredients do i need? Thank you
I believe the first photo is a guy's body check out the belt he's wearing with the belt buckle women do not wear things like that the second one is a woman's figure go figure if you're fooling us you got to do better than this :-)

Any recipes to lose laziness?!!
Hey the all  ingredients have to take out the skin or not .
Green smoothie cleanse by jj smith. . Amazing

I heard we should boil the parsley first, then strain it and only drink the juice (parsley boiled water)
How many days we have to do this..1 week or daily?
Sounds delightful. Uggghhhh!
Start watching from 07:50 min 😁
Can I make the juice with parsley
It is 10am , I'm going to go buy the ingredients and start drinking it tonight. Leave your comment if you want to find out if it really worked out for me ! (I hope so)!
Did anyone realize that the title says a single day but the person said in a week? Like if you noticed.
thumnail boy to girl.
😍
Thanks i try this remady today
Oh my gosh. You took forever to get to the point and that is annoying
At BrightSide: LIES!
They are adding extra sugar to all Drinks.
Is it ok to add honey to the drink?
Jeez this video was too long 😏
Do we need to strain the mixture before drinking this juice.. ?
How many days we should drink this in a week
Can you use dried ginger & parsley? Fresh isn't always available where I live.
Took Way Too Long To Get To The Drink...  Yawn...!!!
Some one tell me does this test good
7:50 ....Say me thank you 😊
8:01 thank me later
The guy explains must better than the lady.
Sounds good, but a little vague. Half a glass of water? What's a glass? 16 oz 8 oz? One Lemon. The whole lemon or a lemon after it's been juiced? One cucumber. With or without the skin? Is there a difference between aloe Vera juice and aloe Vera drink? A bunch of parsley. Curly or flat? A fist full or the whole bunch? Can you be more specific? I'm sure I'm not the only that would appreciate this.
Bright side should do a video on how to reduce video lengths. 2 minutes video simply lengthened to 9 minutes to test viewers patience.
Bright side is really putting misleading names for the videos!! Dislike to that.
Wow 3mins in cant find this bed time drink
I would say there is no shortcut in losing weight. In experience, I lost about 15 kg in 6 months through choosing the right food and exercise. It is a little bit of discipline and sacrifice.
Why I scroll down to see the comment because their is always someone who writes the ingredients 👍😁makes my job easy🤭
Can't share a click bait video full a narrator begging for likes like someone thirsty in the middle of the desert
Could have condensed this wordy 9 min vid into about 30 secs.
doesnt work in a week lies
I have the drink today . Hope it will be helpful . But the taste is yuck
Recipe starts at 7:50😊
I’m pretty sure cucumbers are fruits
why cant you just get to the point? We clicked to know the ingredients not for all the other craps we already know
Loooong video just to tell me the ingredients at the end. I'm disliking the video and blocking the channel.
Wait, I could have sworn that celery was included in this??? So anyway I've been using the following, plus Apple for sweetness. - 1 lemon juiced - 1 TBSP fresh ginger -  about 2 x 1 inches of freshly peeled aloe vera (as opposed to using juice) - a few sprigs of parsley (not an entire bunch) - about 2 inches of continental cucumber - 1 large stalk of celery - a whole red apple (partially cored, but I leave some seeds in) - enough water for the desired consistency. It needs to be drinkable rather than having a thick smoothie consistency.   I had to add apple because the celery made the drink really salty. It wasn't nice. Apple adds much needed sweetness and balance. It is such a refreshing drink which you experience almost instantaneously (the refreshingness that is). I drink it as a meal replacement.   Like all liver cleansing drinks, just be aware that you may notice your skin may not appear too good as all the impurities in your liver are being flushed out. So keep at it and the toxins and fats will be out of your liver and out of your skin in a few days to a week. Drink lots of water too. Keep flushing your body. Very important.
Hmmm interesting..
I can't find parsley in markets in my country. Any substitute?
4:11 it starts Here :V
It took 4:17 before they get to the ingredients. Empty talk before. Eating before bed stops the bodies natural overnight detox known as fasting. Active digestion stops the fast, stopping autophagy, human growth hormone, brain derived brain neuro trophic  factor. Skip eating in the morning and you may get stem cells.  All these anti aging  benefits are stopped. I am very skeptical of this podcast.  For this reason NO THUMPS UP.
Wow
all cut up peel and skin a d all
i made large amount and froze them it takes disgusting so lets see if it works dont forget to do th excercise to train tummy muscles on pic
I love their precise measurements. I mean cucumbers and lemons can come in different sizes, and a bunch of parsley, thanks for the help.
aloe vera you can get from health food shop im lucky we have loads all yr round
One lemon (whole) or lemon juice 🤔?
I would believe it if aloe vera juice could be found, where i live.
There should be some contraindication with this....ie health warnings.....a tablespoon of ginger is a worry for me and a bunch of parsley.....too much parsley can cause health problems so this should be more specific re that......a sloppy info video for health as far as I'm concerned!
Go to 8:03 pause it and take a screenshot. You're welcome.  Love you
I just wanna say that ginger is the best Since I’m drinking Ginger tea 👁
Thank you
Bright side makes unnecessary long videos for no reason
Bitter gourd and beetroot fresh juice... Very very affective i started it on 3rd September drinking it day n night my weight was 82 kg, but now 26 September it's 78 kg... It's great...
Apple cider vinegar and hot tea. Helps me
I already have lost 1p weight just hearing this ingredients 😉😄
What is more, I felt confused/awkward every time she said “what is more”. That sounds so awkward.
Wow!!! I can't imagine it taken me all this long to land on this amazing video. I have been struggling to find a way how to control my ever fattening belly. I'm gonna try out this effective today, though I might not get palsey because I don't think it's available in my local area! Thank you BRIGHT SIDE 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
How about just stop shoveling groceries down your neck?

I love Bright Side . Very informative 😎
Good work.. bright side as always.. I'll try this.. 👍 Just half bottle water morning n bedtime
With the lemon, what do you with the pits?  Secondly, where do you buy aloe Vera juice?
is this safe fot lactating mom? my lo is still 1 month and EBF  THANKS
Nothing works within one night, but if u r drinking something healthy u also need to carry on activity to make such thing use. Just like u cannot put only fuel in a car to ensure running automatically, u need to activate car engine to start a car, so that full car function absorbing the fuel to get result of driving. So u need exercise n healthy drink if u want to ur body to work n get desired result.
Yes....but how does it taste?  Because if it tastes nasty, I won't stick with it.  I know myself well enough to know that!
what about vaccum exercises? u shud mention that
How does one get the aloe vera juice? Directly from the plant or is it available in the market?
yea, u wish, there s no such a thing
This video helped me lose my mind, its way too long.
This video helped me lose my mind, its way too long.
This vid made me wanna get rid of that vat
Taken together with avoidance of wrong foods, this recipe works.  This is good.
Are we supposed to cut the lemon and squeeze it or add it into the grinder as a whole
I have a doubt  Can we have dinner and then drink this shake or else this drink only should be our dinner ah???  @brightside
Too much talking.otherwise. Its helpful
Get to what you promise not sit here and nag !
I have no parsley... what can i use?
Parsley is not available over here right now...instead of it can I use coriander as it is available...or can I exclude the parsley and make the juice and drink...will it work if I exclude parsley? Please help
Its 2019 and I just seen this video for the first time. Did it work for anyone?

Apple cider vinegar is the best weight loss Product
You can’t detox the body! That one huge lie
Who cares about 'famous people'?
DRINK KEFIR.....
Put down the donuts
Bright side is garbage
Great recipe, and great info. Thank you. However no need to mislead people, that’s beneath you. It takes longer than one night and it’s gradual, also doesn’t mean we can binge eat. Healthy eating and lifestyle is still needed.
See at 7.50 minutes
Wow! Before I watched the video,  I said,  "In ONE night?" I'll drink anything for one night.  lol, I might had free to had the a fire hose ready when I do. I gotta psychic up for this one.
4:30 saves time, ingredients for the juice hit that button if you agree 👍
This video tests our patients
Hurry it up next time

Is this recipe for one person and one night? Plz help me
hummm interesting 2 try out , if its so great , y don't doctors give it 2 there patients n talk regular on the news ...
U could have make the video much shorter by coming to the point. It was a uselessly long video. I just went to the end and noted the stuff down.
Dont waste your time i know its precious. VEDIO STARTS at 7:48  😊 *best of luck everyone whoever goning to try this i hope it works*
DOES THIS WORK?  And how long are you supposed to drink this to see results
how much is "a bunch" of parsley?
Uff, got tired before you came to the point 😂
what kind of  parsley  or can i use cilantro
How much lemon or cucumber we have to add
How about you stop eating sugar and stop eating unhealthy food
Me and curious as well
you put lemon and cucumber as it is, with it's skin ?
Thank you...
Bright side I'm disappointed ☹️ calories in vs. calories out equal weight loss. Don't be one of those.. channels. Recognize junk science. If you can't think of a good fact based concept to do a video on than wait a while.Your contents usually good.
My mom bought and drank aloe and lost 5kg+ "can't remember the exact amount" in a week without doing any activites.
Please show me more healthy video's👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I really enjoyed watching your video it's very educational.I normally use fresh lemon and celery and fresh ginger and cucumber 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Video starts at 4:17
Please get to the point
Olord father! This video was to long! Get to the point! Jezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Thank you so much for sharing this I'm gonna try from tomorrow
Forskolin 40% formula capsules from Amazon: 2 in the morning and evening. I lost 11lbs in 4weeks! (About 1-2lbs a night) Bought 2 more bottles, and I also swim 25 laps at the local “Y” nightly when I can. I will definitely give this drink a try though cause I need all the extra boost I can get!!!
Dhop kela maksudai
Thanks
A WHOLE lemon and a WHOLE cucumber plus a bunch of other stuff at bedtime? Real reason for weight loss?: getting up 500 times in the night for the loo, I imagine.  Effective!!
I don't know? What is parsley?
Juice of 1 lemon or lemon with the peel need to blend?? 🙄
You know what? ........ I don't have all the ingredients.....so I'm gonna just do a water fast.
How much of everything? 🙄
Burger and ice creams
I eat one Twinkie a day
Hey bright side I have a question why didn't you mention that you should clean the aloe vera juice cause of the latex in side it I'm not saying I'm allergic to it but you should put the bad side effects that could occur.
Do we cut the lemon in  half or do we just use the juice
i tried this drink and i would actually recommend to take when you wake up because when i took it before going to bed, i had so much energy that i just didn't want to sleep anymore, anyway I took it in the morning and i felt energized for the whole day.
I told my friend about this drink and she told me it works!! I'm determined to do it!!
Who also wanna go prepare it but so lazy to😂👌😅
Clickbait leading up to nothing!   Although rhe contents is informativr.. the headline is misleading!
Where tf u finna find Aloe Vera juice?
Im finna boutta try this y’all I’ll Let you know if and I’ll be measuring my belly and my weight
Hi thanks for sharing.  But 1 question,  will it work without cucumber ?     Thanks
This seems to good to be true, but if it is I only have one question that I cant be the only one wondering, do we put the skin and pulp of the lemon in to the blender. They did say it's the best part but didn't say if we should use it. And is u see this comment before u watch the vid, it actually starts at 7:55 but is u want all the facts watch from the start
I want &like all helthbeuty pepole
I hope I survive. 3...2...1...
Can't we strain that and then drink ?
Hey hasn't anyone invented a weight losing app
I don't want to be skinny like the girl doing exercise. looked emaciated camel
Can we preserve this juice for a week??
Extremly uncessarily long vedio
Who scrolling to see if it works
Is this really affective.. Anyone tested it?
Keto pure + Apple Cider Vinegar is more effect.
I added fresh blended avocado 🥑 seed and it made a thick shake but I woke up totally flat Belley and looked like tiny waist
Seems like an awefull lot to consume before bed!  Blend a whole lemon with all that parsely, etc...would make me have a stomach ache all night.  I thought you were going to say to consume 6 oz of it as a tea!  Is this right...a whole lemon, peel and all, a bunch of parsly, and how much of the grated ginger?  Come on and do a real quantities...or its useless.
seen this drink advertised on another channel on youtube and I am starting this drink tomorrow. All going well with my health, you see, I am classed as severely disabled and in so much pain all the time. And this mixture, (add lime as well, only the juice of one lime), and hey presto, A real, magical drink finally.
Half a glass of normal water or warm water ?.....pleae clarify
Im skinny but i feel the effect that described
Do I put whole lemon?
I've been drinking this after a 1-hour workout for about a week now. I also add 2 TBSP of whey protein powder for muscle health and recovery, and sometimes 1/4 cup of kefir for an extra extra boost of probiotics and protein... I've lost almost 5 lbs, so yeah this works.... however, only if you pair it with CONSISTENT physical activity and avoid processed foods and refined sugar. I tried it before without making any lifestyle changes and it just did not work. But if you stay active and eat well, this WILL work for you!!
Thank you
Everyone please stop eating wheat and dairy products.
Lies they tell lol
FOR GODS SAKE THE LEMON YOU DONT PUT IN THE SKIN!!! ONLY THE JUICE
Thank you bright  side
4:03 Such a lovely video.... But darling, fasten and speed up have very different meanings. Please look it up. Little grammatical errors can make you come across as less professional.
How much do you drink 1 cup?
So you throw a whole lemon and cucumber with skin and everything into the blender?
8 bunches of parsley.. Are you serious? 8 bunches?
bright side is full of lies lol it takes more than one night according to the video.
thanks dear
Too much drama haizzt
Now does this work for men???
Good video :) like

Can you drink this in the morning
Past the drama. Straight to the drink @ 3:18. Amazing info. Thank you.
Is alovera gel and alovera juice the same?
do you peel the lemon and cucumber
Who was counting how many times they asked for a thumbs up? I was I’m so easily distracted lol 😂
Cucumbers are great ! Sometimes I cut up 3 to 4 of them and eat throughout the day . Very fulfilling. I drink plenty of water. It's hard for us truck drivers to eat healthy on the road.  A healthy drink I sometimes make in the mornings is 3 to 4 celery sticks 1 garlic clove Tbsp cayenne pepper (give or take) Tbsp pumpkin seeds  Chai seeds Flax seeds 1 banana  Sometimes I add a half cup frozen fruit 8 to 16 oz water  It taste amazing & gives me that burst of energy  Occasionally I add plant based protein & beets powder if I'm going to drink throughout the day. Or meal replacement.
Who else is scrolling down the comments to see if it works? 😂

It tastes horrible
I made this drink and it tasted terrible, and can you please be specific about the amount of parsley. Because you just say a bunch of parsley and it isn’t specific and for the lemon, do you put the whole lemon in the blender with the skin and everything, or do you squeeze the juice out?

Is it compulsory to use aloe Vera juice necessary
Considering I lowered calorie intake a bit and did light exercises, it does seem to be helpful. good detoxing i guess? But main benefit is that i do feel a bit better (mentally and physically ) with this added to my list :) i say it works depending on what else you add to your routine.

After grinding all the ingredients Can I only drink the liquid after filtering the solid part?  Because after blending all the ingredients for a long time the mixture is still somewhat thick and it's very hard to drink it. So I want to know that will it be equally beneficial only by eating the liquid part after filtering the solid. Will be waiting for your reply. It will be really helpful if u reply as soon as possible
We know u want to help but a single night..
Lemon + cucumber +ginger + aloe vera + parsley .
Its taste is totally 😨😨😨😱😱😱😵😵😵😷😷😷
Great receipe & thx for sharing, however are we using aloe vera juice or the juice from the aloe vera itself? Also a better description of the suggested excercise would've been essential & greatly appreciated!

i ve been juicing all these years on and off, and it really works. I just dont know what veggies go with what. I just gather what ai could think of. Is there a specific combination for each purpose.
The vacum pose scares me
F---ing bulls--t. It doesn't work in one day.....
Be careful. As a former farmer including some background in chemistry and Biology I can say with confidence that you’re saying one thing your video that is deceptive. Plants can make vitamins proteins and enzymes but plants cannot make elements and minerals elements and minerals have to already be in the soil so when you say that a specific food has manganese potassium iodine whatever that is deceptive because not all soil around the world contains all minerals and elements some soil is high in a few minerals and other soil has poor concentrations of the minerals you seek. Mineral concentrations are not perfectly uniform across the entire world so some places will have soil that is richer and other minerals and poor in others. You also seem to forget that most plants only require a very small handful of minerals to produce bountiful yields. The human organism requires a truckload of minerals trace minerals include it to operate at peak biological capacity. If you grow a cucumber and soil that does not have the minerals you mentioned in the video it may still grow but it won’t have those minerals and thus those benefits will not be there. You didn’t think about that part did you? I get all my minerals including the trace ones in Colloidal form from a doctor that has earned my trust over the years. He owns a mine and extracts minerals with labor help to sell the “mineral cocktail” to any who desire it. His name is Dr. Joel Wallach and the mineral cocktail that I buy for my family and my kids and even my dogs is called “Plant Derived Minerals”. It’s a colloid which can hold a lot more solute than a typical water based solution. I still garden lots of fruits and vegetables to eat and such and I’m very healthy. I just don’t rely on the soil to keep my family and my own old parents alive mineral wise.
Thank you. I know some will complain that intro is too long but that's only cause some of us like to know the benefits and vitamins of foods. It's good to be informed
Reading through these comments I am honestly ashamed. This is more of detoxing the body then weight loss, but toxins are a big part of weight gain. Get rid of said toxins and stay active and you can loose weight a bit easier. They are not saying it is a “miracle” or a “cure” they are saying it helps PREVENT it. Or make life a bit easier for those to have problems. The amount of negativity towards this is astonishing and honestly? Childish. This works for most people, if it doesn’t work for you, keep finding something that does.
Just tried it and it taste so bad
I am a big fan of green tea! Love Chinese traditional tea! Sooo gooood

This is a ClickBait Template...I disliked as usually, but now I'm putting your channel on my VideoBlocker list. You're welcome.
10 minutes for 20 relevant seconds? today everyone is very clever, doctor, dietetician, engineer, know-it-all specialist...
Can you use oregano or does it have to be parsley? I don’t have fresh parsley 😬
Does this really work or just made up?
Muisc by Kelvin M
I LOVE ginger and lemon,  but gives me an allergic reaction. WHAT  CAN I DO? PLEASE  LET ME KNOW?
Why didn't they mention to have an extra set of boxer or skates near the bed to you have to hurry to the 🚽??
This video takes entirely too long to get to the point!!!! Annoying!
geez too much nonsense talk
https://youtu.be/zWONrsuNDBU
sop all the bla bla bla and get on with it
Thank you gonna try this
4:00 "Fasten" your metabolism? I think she meant Speed up your metabolism.
one whole lemon? it's so bitter why oh why :/
But that what you promise, this is faking, very simple, I know it doesn't and also will not work if someone one is over wait, may will work if you are little blown
4:10 is when she says the recipe.
Stop telling me to like this video.
can you make it without the alovera juice
Is this something that is already made in a bottle that I can get a groceries store?
Nitty Gritty 7:53, you are welcome!
What do we do with the lemon??
I've lost 5 kilo by just drinking a lot of water, cuz it makes me less hungry :D
Thank for that.. I will try it and let u know if it's working for me.
It is helpfull
Um, yea right.
I just sleep with thin small PJ's on and it works wonders until I eat cake 😂😂
it works according to one person wh tried the drink. unfortunately, he’s nowhere to be found
Juicing gets rid of fibre.  Your liver detoxes your body.
I liked for your efforts 👍🏼
It does work. Not that fast though
#bright side... any replacement of parsley ???
Can we replace parsley with coriander..in India, may be it's not possible to find parsley over here.
I eat whole, unprocessed plant based foods. As much as i want. Avoid sugar, oils and salt. Walk each day. Have lost a lot of weight. Check out Dr Greger on YouTube. This drink sounds good. But not before bed. I consume zero calories at night and only eat in an 8 hour window. That works wonders too for me. Talk to your doctor. Good luck
in a few days? i mean u said "in a Single Night" so much click bait
my mom lost weight actually incorporating chia seeds in her diet.
I pray for my stomach 😳💨💨
Thank you so much so only for one night will try dear
How do i now this *ACTUALLY* works?
Is this jilly juice?
I agree But did you really try?  Any statistics?
lemon, cucumber, aloe vera, kurkuma, ginger, pasley   There you go
Respect and love.
Nice hocus-pocus video :D
I’m doing my own method, not this one, and I lose 8kg in 3weeks.
Can "fasten " your metabolism! I think it means, can speed up your metabolism.
Where can you buy that jucie from in the UK
Better vision!! 😂😂. Heard it all now. Fml. Any this stuff ever true we would all be healthy and live forever. If only
so ... does it really work  ?
And we’re exactly did u get this medical information from ? 🤔
Make sure you blend this VEEEERY well. I gagged the first time
"Hey, Sharon, it got me. The click bait got me."
Life gives you lemons!
Does this work
Im seriously going to give this a try
This is the silliest piece of nonsense I've seen in a while.
You can see my pictures Wellnesstropical4869 on Instagram if you want and in 30 days I can post what happens
My basic diet from many years was based in protein with really works for me but know my body does not respond to it
I have to say that I do eat very healthy and I have be testing your training and types but probably my biggest problem is I love to drink wine and is very difficult to cat off
This do not work in one day, that's clear 😞😒
Can i use cilantro instead of parsley?
The season of cucumber has been ended what i can use in place of cucumber ?
Honey
So basically this drink will change gender...just asking cuz of thumbnail 😁😁
Wait... so we need to blend the lemon with its skin??
That's  supposed tasteood😐
Video starts at 7.48
I see a lot of people wondering is this works, i've been making it for a little over a week and maybe it helps. But this isn't some kind of magic juice. Its just one tool in a large kit to help with healthy living and weigh loss. you still need to make good choices in your eating habits and exercise regularly if you really want to see results. It is a good drink though lol
It starts in 4:10
I can’t wait to try this detox drink thanks 🙏!.

Maybe later on, I could give this recipe a try.
Thank you for recipe before bed to help my organs and weight issues as well as spare tire. I will buy things tomorrow and start tomorrow night.

Another Jilly juice? HMMMMMMMMMMM 🧐
I don't have the patience to watch the whole 9 minutes of this.  I guess I won't know what the drink is.
How often do we have to drink this?
Thanks for the excellent info.
Loss credibility. Before photo seems to be a man while after photo it is definitely a woman.
Well I add 1. cucumber  2. Ginger  3. 2 slice of pineapple  4. 4 stick of mints leaves  5. 100 % Aloe vera juice  6. All natural Honey  Blind well and drink the juice...enjoy my friends!!!
does dis work?
Do we use a full cucumber
They made slick sam slime whatttt I watch that almost every day 😱😱😱😱😱
3:40 You're welcomed😂
Best things to do are to stop drinking sodas or any other kind of sugary drink, and drink water only.  Next, look at what you eat: stop all sugary treats like pies, cakes, cookies, ice cream, etc.  No pastas, breads or noodles.  Now you're thinking, you've told me all these things I can't have anymore--what CAN I have to eat?  To start, lean meats such as fish, chicken and turkey (no frying but broiling, baking and boiling), and you can also eat beans and other legumes for protein.  Vegetables, freshly cooked in olive oil or frozen to steam-cook in microwave.  Fresh fruit (or dried) added to a tossed salad (stay away from romaine lettuce) along with nuts such as walnuts, cashews or almonds.  You can also hold the fruit for later in a nice cup for dessert.   Turn off the TV and computer.  Take a nice walk every day (running is BAD for your joints).  Get plenty of sleep and take a nap later if you can.  Drink water before you are thirsty--if you feel thirsty then you are already getting dehydrated.  Don't watch the news: turn it off and turn on the Word of God, the Bible.  Give your life to the Lord Jesus Christ, and watch Him change you into what He created you to be!  Love you, take care!
Lemon water bettee

Can u plz share some proper deit plan ?
It's a failure system because nobody can live with detoux for a long time!
I know this may sound dangerous but for one year I did studies on my own body for my weight and much more. I decided to do a coffee diet I replaced two meals a day with coffee, a healthy snack and a very healthy meal. This helped me in so many ways. Now, I do this diet for 7 days once a month to help with my weight. However, if you are tall and or naturally thin I wouldn’t recommend my diet.
It works, worked out a lite and went down 2sizes within 2weeks
Mulberry Tea and Lemons will take care of sugar cravings. It's real helpful.

Like if they didn’t tell the ingreadians
Click Bait!
Why is your recipe done at night alone? I stay in shape consistently with sticking to water, exercises [walking], foods high in protein, vegetables and fruits
I tried to drink it but the taste was so strong I couldn’t finished 😔
I eat all foods at anytime anyhow and never gain or lose weight.
Not work

Who else is young and can't buy this stuff and it would be weird to ask your mom to buy it for you?
Change that title ,not at single night
Too fu...... spicy because of the ginger, and a little bit horrible taste. I'll see the results in two weeks as you said and then will decide whether to recommend it or not
Just one question. How do we know this will work?
Is there anybody who benefit with this drink?
Diet habits is hard but very good idea to have notes. Give time to those Vocabulary words.
Slight Caloric Deficit + HIIT/Cardio + Lots of Healthy fats and protein = weight loss
Bruh
Excellent! I will follow through!

Veggie smoothie comprised of the following : Tumeric Kale Apple juice Cucumber 🥒 Avacado Ginger Raddish Spinach
Remove that much weight in a single day/ “night” ( according to the picture) seriously.  Why show that? That is very deceiving. Over time sure definitely.

https://www.redteadetox.com/?hop=ram5500  This recipe led to my life-changing fat loss: I shed 14 pounds in only a few weeks. That all changed when I took a plane to Africa and discovered the delicious tea that made me burn body fat quickly and easily, without feeling hungry. Now, you need to read this article until the very end, because I'm actually going to give you this revolutionary ancient tea recipe today.
I just love clic_baits
Great video, I’ve been drinking this very same combination except I also add turmeric! I intermittent fast as well. I was 223lbs 228lbs, it’s been three months and I’m at 190lbs!!!!!! It works
Can't tell you if it works but man that stuff sure is nasty. Day 2😝
Thanx
Thanx
I like it and will try it.
Not bad, will try it. Video far too long and the facts questionable.  Parsley does not come from Italy originally, as the name should give you a clue. Thanks for the effort anyway.
I use green tea, detox water for detoxification
It works?
how about lemon, cucumber, menthe and apple ???
4:08 is when they actually start talking about the drink
It doesn’t work!
7:49
Anyone from here done this yet?
Those sugar cubes looked good! Is there ginger in this? How can we make it taste better?
This is Absolutely amazing. I have been drinking this formula at night while only juicing during the day and eating no solid foods. It has only been about one week and my stomach has gone way down. I am not where I want to be yet but the results are definitely noticeable. Thank you very much for this.
How far in this video do you have to wait to hear about the drink?
I have used lemon, cucumber, ginger, lime, and rosemary. I made a gallon mixture that I drank throughout the day. I was able to lose weight. I purposely didn’t exercise to see how much it would work. I also ate healthier meals.
Hi, can coriander / cilantro be used instead of parsley here?
Skip to 7:59
Add apple cider vinegar ☺
7:49
Can't you tell me a substitute of parsley .. ??  I don't think I'll find it here in my city..  Will a bunch of corriander leaves help..??
4:10 is when it ACTUALLY starts
Video starts at 4:15 so here’s what you need.   1/2 glass water + 1 Lemons (skin and pulp) + 1 cucumber + 1 tbsp grated ginger + 1 tbsp aloe Vera juice + bunch of parsley....all grated together.
Is it safe to drink over time? I mean our body is supposed to be resting while we are sleeping but if we drink this our digestive system will continue to work even at our sleep.  I want to try this and record any changes made.
This actually works
What aloe vera juice should I buy? :) Where do I buy it?
Any side effects of this drink ?

I suggest going on the "Zone Diet" as promoted by Dr. Barry Sears. I lost 30lbs in 7 weeks on it.
How can I gain weight tho
Treadmill dude, giggles
actual video start on 3.11...
yall need to look up the “military diet” type that in youtube and its the first video. its howto lose 10 lbs in 3 days. me and 2 friends have done it it works
Very simple to loose weight just eat less don't eat to much cake and bread exercise everyday
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Bullshit😂😂😂
It's really work
Awesome video
does it work on filled stomach ? Reply Me Sir/Ma'am
Can you please mention the complete recipe of the drink. how n what to blend . eg: lemon juice goes in to blender or pieces of lemon goes in the blender ??
I'll tell you what...for every 7 days eat 1 complete day only raw vegetables and no fruits or juices coz it has sugars...see the difference
potatoes in large volumes, impossible not to lose weight, calorie density is the key
just start eating one meal a day. this diet solved all of my problems. dont have to worry about macro counting or anything like that and plus you feel satisfied without cravings since you can eat pretty much all that you can desire. have been doing this diet for 6 months, and lost 30 lbs. havent gained a pound since.
4:12 $tart the video
Video starts at 4:20
You can't loose or gain anything in a single night. Nice clickbait though.
nice
This is the best youtube channel ever
I LOVE THIS CHANNEL!  MAHALO NUI LOA!
1/2 glass of water, 1 lemon, 1 cucumber, 1Tbsp Aloe Vera Juice, 1 Tbsp grated ginger, a bunch of parsley -- Blend all. YW

I think it would be better without ginger
so you throw everything in the blender? no peeling. no nothing? i will try it myself.
Skip to 3:11 Thank me later😂
4:15 onwards

1/2 half glass of water . . .hmmm how large a glass,  and how large a cucumber?   Lemon size is relative I guess although some lemons come quite large.  I'll most likely come up with my own concoction/amounts.  Worth a try I suppose.
Let's revise?
This will my mission starting tonight & I will share any changes since I’m suffering all of these crazy things that you mentioned in the video.
Thanks to you I am losing weight

Lies
7:51  Let's review. *Let's revise.*
With the right blender you can include the skin which is full of nutrients—(a Vitamix will do it)—probably be even more effective with the new vacuum blenders or even a cold press juicer .
any option if no aleo vera juice
This better work of it doesn't bad things are going to happen to you
Fast forward to 4:12
Removing bright side from my subscriptions. Don't appreciate click bait

Do we drink like 10 mins before or 30 min?
Along with the drink...will our daily food consumption have any reverse impact on the drinks effect?
Clickbait. Long drawn out video which doesn't mention quantities or specific information. The resulting drink I made after following the laughable instructions was upwards of 14oz, Who'd want to drink that much liquid right before hitting the sack? I'm getting sick of this channel's clickbaitey, fluffed up and unreal videos. This same video was posted to another channel the same day as it was posted in this channel (and the header talks about even another channel!); they're expanding and milking dat cow out 'til it's dry. Do NOT subscribe, do NOT comment (I know) and dislike.... Force them to earn their keep with intelligent, quality-driven and well laid out content!
I have very bad gag reflex and this was very difficult to drink
This helps DETOX ur body! If u really want to lose weight, juice kale, cucumber, ginger and celery with coconut water or plain spring water. Then, add half teaspoon of cayenne pepper. It will speed up metabolism and digestive system. Excellent for those who suffer from constipation. The weight loss is REAL! DON'T weigh yourself EVERYDAY! Instead, MEASURE ur waist line everyday and THEN 7 days later after drinking this detox juice, weigh yourself. I'm just saying that because weighing yourself everyday will drive u INSANE! Good luck everybody! #ME TOO !
This channel sucks
How many Days Should we drink....

I cnt eat lemon. plz substitute
I wrote ur recipe for flat stomach, lemon, ginger, cucumber, aloe, parsley, 1/2 glass of water. I was ready to start today, but I have a problem I'm on warfarin blood thinner I can't have vitamin k, nor any green veggies such as parsley & cucumber. How else can u help? me.
I tried the drink, but I have one question. Do I drink it with the pulp or do I strain it?
It didn't work for me.. I did it for 45 days
I’m going to try this along with excessive and eating better, I’ll tell you how it goes after a week, I’ll be drinking it every night before bed Edit: just realized I don’t have aloe Vera juice or parsley but im gonna try it with everything else
Hii.i am new subscriber ...i want to know if i take the drink after my lunch or in morning.......is it work or not...plz late me know
The drink tastes horrible omfg!!! But I must try and tough it out
I followed the recipe.  Mine turned out to be a thick sludge. Tastes awful. Not a green liquid pictured on the screen.
8 minutes of introduction with 50 like simbols, smh
I would like to know if I have to strain the string after making it
Doesn't work :)
I want to try this and see if it's work...
This will work for sure. Also my secret is drink plenty of water throughout the day like at least 3.5 to 4 litres. Have a light dinner, a healthy breakfast with one solid food and some water intake like juice or green tea , a light lunch followed by any yogurt product, and a healthy evening snack.. fruits/sprouts.. with indulgence in delicacies once a week... lol ...
How big of a cucumber needed , how many cups

Hlo g ye is mosam me bhi pi sakte hai kya
aloe Vera is good for skin and skin and rich of anti oxidant
Gained 1.5lbs per week, no skin changes whatsoever.
"Drink it before bed and in a few days....." Do we drink the whole concoction once/the first night or do we spread it out over a few nights? Or do we make a new one everyday a drink that everyday?  Or is only once necessary?
if you just eat healthy and do lots of exercise you can loose weight  and I run every weekend or if I have time after school and I am going to try the drink but I have to get the ingredients first
So who want to do a before and after for us ?
Also what if you're already skinny and then you drink it? Will you become extra skinny? Like how skinny? Boney skinny? Or will nothing happen?
Should you drink the whole thing I got 3 4 glasses or should I do 1 glass a day?
I have stsrted cinimmon powder 1 teaspoon and 2 tea spoon of acacia honey since 2 weeks ago and i have ckecked my weight. I cant realy believe. I have lost 8kg weight. I am going to carryon and see. I was 78.8kg and today i am 70.6kg😮😲. I want to add this parsley one too.
Any one tried? What’s the results
What size cucumber should we use?
I'm allergic to Aloe Vera...will this drink still work without Aloe Vera or does it have to be in there?
4:09 is where they actually tell you the ingredients for the drink and it doesn't remove it in only one night. IT takes time. You're welcome.
That seems like a lot to have on your stomach if you're going to bed.
Can someone list to me what we put in this drink? I think I missed something?
I started an intermittent fasting for weeks now, and I didn't see any changes yet. Well, thanks to this video I am more  inspired to lose weight :*
Worst tasting thing I've ever had. Could not get myself to physically drink it.😣
I felt sorry for the woman reading the script; it sounded like it was written by someone whose native language couldn't possibly have been English! Good info, but, man, was that distracting.
Not frightening at all, that more are now more overweight than malnourished. That’s a good thing!  Not where we want to be, but so much better than the other way around.
i get cancer form this music
Guys guys...you dont need to be skinny to be beautiful. We are all beautiful in our own way skinny or not. Look at me im not skinny, and im happy with my body. If you wanna lose weight go ahead, but im making a point. You shoulnt change who you are inside...with time all of that should change anyways. Thanks :)
*Must be true because lots of famous people use it!* LOL
I boil ginger, add half lemons juice and black salt, its yummy and I lost 5 kg. It should be taken on empty stomach in morning.
Pls go straight to the point
Wow
Has anyone tried this??If yes then please share the results..Wanna confirm wheather it really works..
Does anyone notice that "Let's Review" is "Let's Revise"?
I feel guilty, I ate a burrito 😣
I was legit like,please don't say ginger,please don't say ginger. Then it said ginger,f**k.
Recipie is at 7:49! To avoid all the excess data in between.
Would be a lot easier if they put the recipe in the description
4:36 MY EYES 😢😢😢
I stoped watching after I heard “u need to eat the skin and the pulp...”
can i add a tablespoon of honey ?
Ho in OK
It works the glass I use has gotten skinnier
I don't have HIGH hopes, but I'm a little intrigued. Maybe I'll give it a shot. You never know.
I’m doing it now. It’s not tasty but I will finish the week. And keep you updated if you want that😃
I will make before and after photos and try! Will measure weight too! Can b your mouse lol but i am starting yoga too 😁
Plz do post videos which may advice us those drinks.which will increase height rapidly
pancakes, mmmmmmmmmmmmm waffles,,,, mmmmmmmmmmmmm
Just skip to 7:48 for the drink.   The rest is just the usual common knowledge stuff about health that probably brought you to this video anyway.
No, I don't like to be lied to, we get enough of that from our government. You said one night, turns out it's one week- if that. Lier.
Editorial Natural: You never specified after skinning the ginger you didn't specify how much to put into you cucumber, & lemon mixture. Was it the whole ginger you showed in your video or smaller amt. Thank you Eloi
I want to know can I make this juice for couples  of days
wonderful, i will try this and hope to God it works. Thanks for sharing
You will need— -half a glass of water -a lemon -a cucumber  -one tablespoon grated ginger -one tablespoon aloe vera juice -a bunch of parsley  This are the ingredients you need
04:12
Awesome video.Thx
ahhh wich ones to trust?
Almost half of the video is rubbish. It actually starts at 4:11. Even after that it gives some unnecessary information and explanation. They could make all of this video in 3 to 4 minutes.
Omg i tried this and it really worked i lost 700 calories overnight. Ugggglassssss
This is going to help a lot
Omfg thank you soooooooooo much!!!!!!! I love you

Chicken burger is better😏
It absolutely does work. I've been using this method and others like it, for more than 25 years. Consistency is key. ☺  Be careful with Parsley if you take Coumadin. Otherwise, parsley is wonderful and tastes delicious!
Parsley? Imma just go pluck some from my dad's garden 😉
Will it work with a finder lemon tea that I got from the store in a tea bag
ASHUT UP
What if your allergic to lemon
Good
Thanks
That extra pound around the waist- hahahahaha!
Can boys use...
I can't believe it but I have already lost weight since the beginning of 2018  and I did no exercise. They are so right. This works-  https://tinyurl.com/ydb9a8so
I don't imagine a 1 day/night solution to the problem, but the title is missleading
my bad it does work
it wokeseems
Most seeds are hard because they are not meant to be digested because they have toxins in them, like ARSENIC. So do not include seeds in your blended drinks. Please add this to your video.
Don’t over do it though nobody likes a EXTREMELY skinny body so be aware and safe
Do I just go to dollarama to get Alo vera drink
It’s really yummy 😋
I need  this
Like this first.....then listen before you know if you're going to like the content. What's wrong with this picture. Hello.
XD I think it will not work but I don't know for sure ★
What about weight
Sounds good. I'll try it. What I do now is A VITAMIN C DRINK:  1t C +1t soda, 1 lemon juice, some flavoring, 4 oz water then add willard water, fulvic acid and 4 drops DMSO. THIS IS REALLY SUPER. Now I will combine your drink and mine! Of course I can stand something that is good for me, though tastes bad. I MAY live longer and better.
5:34 that's a pickle
I drink pure grapefruit juice before I go do bed.
it works but you Must be consistent with the process effort. you'll try it your self 😁😊👍

Drink this before going to bed and drink apple cider vinegar when u wake up !
I used to drink this and it works wonders !! I loved it❤️
But why to drink this in the evening? Why not in the morning when you will be active during the day and when you actually need all the energy and you will be likely to burn even more calories with this during the day ? There must be a reason for evening consumption, please let me know what it is :)
Is it ok to drink this while breastfeeding?
7:53
8:03 thats the summary
What is this video! 9 minutes to show how to make the drink! You should at least name this video differently so people know it's a long health video. Would take 2 minutes or so simple vid to show how to make the drink!
7:54 JUST CUT TO THE CHASE BRIGHT SIDE
Eat as much as you want as long as you don't swallow it.
wow it really works
Hi

Recipe at 8:03
The skin of the lemon come on
One lemon and one cucumber with others comes to one big glass. Can half be drank and the other half  be kept in the fridge for the following night. Would appreciate a quick reply.
Utter nonsense! Hyperbole worthy of the media so-called 'health' journalists.
Wow, you could have done a 1 minute video and put the recipe into the description. What a waste of time.
...and you can even sleep with make up on...

https://mattkutz.theconversionpros.com/sl/redtea/

Do u blend the whole lemon ??
Parsely is a  great breath neutralizer

Thank you so much for repeating the ingredients.
Q: What products do you consume to stay in shape? (8:35) A: Air, water, e.t.c.
Lemons hurt my teeth
The best body detox of all times is the Islamic Fasting (from sunrise to sunset for just one month) with daily activities, or better by doing some exercises few hours before braking the fast. You cannot imagine how your body will become and rejuvenate. 2 billion people would tell you it works wonders including myself! Better do it on holidays to avoid a lower efficiency at work or while studying.
I just got a wait loss ad..
Can't complain guyz, awesome thanks
If I couldn't get Also Vera , so is it ok?
I have that product absolutely work ask me how

I'm from the uk and I was looking online for the ingredients. I found Aloe Vera juice drink. is that what I use? I'm asking because the drink I found does contain sugar sadly

I'm tight that I could've just skipped to the end for all the ingredients in a list
The taste is very bad but, I'm trying it from today itself let's see the result for a week then will reply if it's work or not.

https://youtu.be/Nv05lW9rmcQ
Is there anything I can use in place of aloe Vera juice
Hey do u need the aloe Vera juice or u don't?

Gained 9 pounds doing this for a week.  I eat paleo and have for many years this did the opposite of what they said
OOOOMMMMGGGGG.... she's talking soooo much. Good information but too much talking.

Should we peel the cucumber? Or use the skin too like the lemon?
It was good until u show a nasty cat ugggggg

Our bodies need nourishment.  So many people are overfed & undernourished.  I'm excited to add this concoction to my list of life changes for 2018!
3:27 ewwww that looked so weird why would anyone want to be that skinny!
I don't have alovera and parsley
hey listen I am going to try this but nowadays cucumber is not available
I'm sure thus taste disgusting
This sounds really expensive if youre using a whole cucumber and lemon everday. And also does it matter if organic or not?
High speed blending is not good anyway, cold pressed is the key.  So i bet allot of people pressed like before you said blending at high speed.
8:03 when u actually get the ingredients
The recipe is at 8:00
I think she is the same voice as allrecipes videos...this drink is nothing new...but super yummy!
8:02
i am luminat yea
Do u put the whole cucumber in and the whole lemon in?
Hope this drink works as it tastes disgusting lol
I started using it now. The taste is not bad. No harm to try. I used half glass water. Pealed half lemon. Half cucumber some parcly and one table spoon on ale vera juice. Some comments said its taste soo bad then i think they did not peel the lemon and they through the whole lemon in juicer🤣. Guys u can increase and decrease the quantity of each component according to your taste
The video starts at 7:48
Can a twelve years old have this drink and do I need to put the whole lemon in the blender or I have to slice it or even squeeze the juice out?

What about drinking a glass of milk before going to bed ?  What are it's health benefits ? ...waiting for your reply.....
Ok I hope it may be work
Wow so nice and easy to get healthy hair
there is only one way to lose weight - watch what you eat and count your calories and exercise. boring, but true
you can speed it up don't wait whole week - add turmeric honey kale and splash of apple cider vinegar into the drink - mix it and than before drinking strain it through cheese making muslin cloth, pour the liquid in over the garden and eat all the chunks trapped in the cloth :)     for even faster benefits dont forget to use some positive thinking self reinforcement by standing in front of the mirror 3 times a day chanting - every minute im looking younger, healthier and thinner and i feel good about myself and my body.
Do you have to use a hole lemon? It doesn't say
Look for a video on YouTube that has Moringa and scam in the title. Moringa is the new detox.
Can this work for guys
My apologies I was premature in my comments.  Sorry!!
Good video but do not "bait and switch"   What is the bedtime drink.  Thank you!!

Is it okay to eat 2tsp of honey every day? Because that's what I've been doing for weeks now. I do it because I have a low immune system and i get sick alot. Plus honey is easy to encorporate into my diet.
I love the sugar, carbs and calories. I get most of these from whole plant foods like fruit, legumes and grains. Avoid oil and salt.
Can I fix extra and put in refrigerator for a weekly use or do I need to do this nightly?
According to Ayurveda, ginger is a "hot" herb and not good to have "hot" before bed!
Q
Straight to the point
why didn't you put the mesoriements( i don't know how to spell it) (for example 2/3 or 100g)
Is it safe to use this drink which contains lemon juice if I am using statins?
Too much hustle and information not related in the title. WHO F#%*CKING ASKED YOU?
If u dont have aloe vere ,can u mix rest and drink ...With out aloe vera i can USE?
There is no magical solution, miracle food or drink. There is only a balanced diet, regular exercise and maybe a little dietitian advice. Everything else can probably contribute some 10% to your weight loss, don't expect any more.  How do I know? Direct experience.  We can't lose weight because we're too fond of certain kinds of food and drink. Truth.
avera juice,lemon,cucumber,parch leaf,and giger for loosing weight,,,let me know,if I have all the ingredients..
Yes but does this work?
Lorna borse
Alright. I did it and it makes ALOT. How much of this is the proper amount to take. 6oz or 8 oz or what???
The ingredients for the detox drink r at 4:17
Thanks
Wonderful, thank you very much !!! In your next video, can you please tell us sg good about pineapples and grapefruits too  ?  Those are my favourites 😊
Do I have to make an individual drink EVERY TIME before bed? That's time consuming. Do you have a recipe with ingredients for a BIG batch in a BIG jar so all I have to do is go to refrigerator and pour it already made in a glass and drink it? Thank you
how to get this?
Super
Eat every thing healthy and walk a lot that’s the most natural healthy way for a good shape ( simple and easy )

Has this worked for anyone?
Easy tip: Detox water. Just put all the ingredients in one cup or two cups of water and leave it overnight. Drink it every day.
Its amazing stuff ,i drank 4 glasses and lost so much weight i fell between the floorboards and died ,do you know how hard it is to type as a ghost ! Utter nonsense anyone that even thinks theres a miracle cure for obesity needs their head examining
Punch it up by adding turmeric, cinnamon, coconut oil, and muscadine grape seed extract to experience even MORE weight loss. Grape seed oil on its own, when taken with every meal, every snack, and every sugary drink, can make you lose up to 20 lbs in a matter of weeks. It's done that for me 3 separate times! I'll no longer allow myself to ever run out of my precious GSO pills from Amazon. They've proven themselves effective too many times now to be coincidence, or to be attributed to the something like the full moon, or the fact that I was facing due east with the sun on my face while standing on one foot and humming the show tune for Sesame Street as I consumed my sugary food/drink. 🤣
At the end it shows bananas in the fridge, bottom right shelf, in the back. Bananas should NEVER be refrigerated. They are tropical fruits! Didn't you ever hear the banana song?!? LOL Search it here on YouTube! 😀  STORE BANANAS AT ROOM TEMP, PEOPLE. 😁
I had hope until I realised I didn't have any ginger ;-;
I was sitting in Baskin Robbins while watching this
The Ingredients listed to make the drink, is this for one drink? 7 bunches of Parsley in one week, that seems a little extreme.....or do you get multiple did is out.of it???
I think everyone is beautiful just the way you are.  No one needs these unless you want to drink it but, you're beautiful!
Just an other guy wanting to be a millionaire on us
watchin this video while stuffing pizza😁
Recipe is at 4:15 of you don't want to wait to get to the point of this video
Does it matter if we eat something AFTER drinking this?  Will there be the same results?  Also, is it necessary to drink this right before sleeping? Would 1-2 hours before work?
I drink1 tsp. Chia seeds soaked in a 3/4 cup of water with a 1 teaspoon of squeezed lemon 1/4 tsp honey granules and 1 tsp of molasess mixed up with a wand and drank right before breakfast.

Instead of parsley can we use coriander
BAD translations...really...."fasten your metabolism" should read "speed up your metabolism"...for instance.  Cut to the chase:  ingredients for this drink start at about 4:14.   BTW:  Limes work as well  as lemons for this. But oranges and grapefruit can't, due to their sugar content.  1 c.Water; + 1 Lemon; + 1 Cucumber;  + 1 Tblsp. each:  Ginger + Aloe juice; + bunch of parsley . Blenderize all that. Drink. Now, a WARNING:  The limonene that's in the outer peel of citrus [that colored oil that escapes when you scrape the outside of the peel with a knife or fingernail], can be very caustic to the lining of the gut.    In fact, it's a great degreaser...which is what it does to the gut lining, too.        PLEASE be careful using the outside of the peel, containing this solvent oil, from any citrus....only use maybe a teaspoon of the outer peel, at a time.      What's really healthy to consume, is the inner peel of citrus, because that's where so many Bioflavanoids are found. And it has a very mild flavor..almost no flavor.
Where is my pizza???
Very good
Thank you so much for sharing. It is really working on me though it is very hard to drink but it worths.

Great advice!!! Thank you very much!!
Can I use Cilantro as a substitute of parsley???

I like how the video says within a week but the title says in one night

It's sounds easy ...but with 3 kids yo take care of.....it sounds like a lot for me to be doing ....just being honest
Where can i buy aloe vera juice?

I want Good Steak.
While watching this video all I can think about is a donut 😂 🍩
watch from 7:53 to know the ingredients...dont waste your time... to Bright Side..it is better to reveal the secrets from the beginning of the video, n explain benefits later...
Tonight was my first attempt at making/drinking this.  It was thicker than I was expecting.  And it was very filling.  It was difficult to drink quickly.  It took me 30 minutes to finish it.
do we just squeeze the one lemons juice in the blender or do we put the whole lemon with the skin ???? Please someone answer.
Is anyone eating the full lemon!!
These things just go on and take forever to get to the point.
I'm watching this eating pizza :P blend an entire cucumber ? and where to get Aloe Vera juice ?

@2:59 😻
I drank it, and my wife was still there in the morning.
Just wondering, can I skip the Aloe Vera juice and just add in Cucumber, Lemon, Ginger and Parsley? Aloe Vera is a little hard to get where I am. would it still be effective?
what a way to extend a video, reason enough to unsubscribe
can you use powdered ginger?
what about the pits in the lemon?
Allergic to cucumber,  replacement ideas
Allergic to ginger!
I’m gonna start eating like u tommarrow thnx
Honestly can't figure out if this is a joke or not.Recent scientific studies have indicated you can lose weight by not shoving so much food in your mouth and getting off you arse and moving about a bit.
So u have to eat the lemon whole like an apple?
Hi Adam saleh
Thanks for sharing!!
7.55
Go to 8:00 min if you have no time to waste. You’re welcome.
so it sounds like it will taste a Lil funky. what about adding a banana to it, just for flavor. would that have any affect or no?
Not over night will it happen... But in time.. Healthy Benifits regardless
Beautiful, beneficial for the society.
Video begins at 4:15, your welcome
Can a 12 years old like can drink like that??
I usually eat a lot of dried fruits and lemon juice.
Oh my god. You're supposed to have some toxins in your body.
So I made this for the first time tonight and it's not horrible and we'll see if it works but I just wanted to share some tips in making the drink for those of you who are challenged in culinary arts.    1. Pick off the parsley leaves.  Don't throw the stems in there because it will be bitter af 2. Peel the ginger with the edge of a spoon and there is no reason to grate it as it is being pulverized in a blender  3. Put the whole lemon in there, fine, but remove the seeds.  Also bitter  4.  Cut the lemon and cucumber up into pieces to make it easy on your blender  I'm going to try making it with coconut water to see if that makes it a little more enjoyable
Is there any thing else can use besides lemons? Allergies
Is there anything I can replace the parsley for?
Can men drink this to or will it bring out my girly side
Has anyone actually tried this? Results?
Skip to 7:55 - you're welcome
Do we use the lemon peel or squeeze it in? Also, a WHOLE cuke?
Will definitelytry this and let u know
Where u get a alovera juice
I AM SORRY THAT I DID NOT KNOW ALL THAT WHEN I WAS YOUNG....I EAT SO MUCH JUNK..NOT ANY SALAD OR FRUITS..I HAVE CHANGE MY DIET NOW AND HAVE SOME GOOD RESULTS....NEVER TO LATE JUST BECAUSE BE OLDER..

I am so grateful for 2X speed. I love your videos but they are so full of fluff they are kind of hard to watch. That and you do everything so slowly.
4:09 Thank Me Later
I have literally noted almost all of these facts, ingredients and effects. Thank you for this recipe
I just might give this a try. 😊
Like this
Also, you should drink a glass of lukewarm water with squeezed lemon every morning, immediately after you wake up. For the day you should prepare the following drink:  2,5 litre of water 4 lemons sliced 4 cucumbers sliced  Put this into the fridge for 4-5 hours and drink this all day. After 2pm eat 2 bananas. If you can do this for 21 days you will lose all the weight you need to lose, even if you need to lose 50 lbs.
If all the ingredients are not available every time then.....????????
I used everything in the clip instead of parsley I used mint leaves
Milk thistle, garlic supplement work great to detoxify liver..
Blend all of these to make a delicious drink... Really?? :)
Can I use powders of the elements!!! ???  Because I stay in hostel can't use blender??
I HATE these videos that carry on and on and on, keep asking you to tap the "like" button, but take FOREVER to get to the flipping point! Can't like that... 😒
You can really loose 65lbs easy doing this

HI BRIGHT SIDE I MADE THIS DRINK FOR TWO MONTHS STRAIGHT BUT MY WEIGHT HAS ONLY GONE DOWN BY 0.929 nanograms rounded to the nearest thousandth. In fact I mutated somehow and grew an extra toe,which counteracted my marginal weight loss which caused deep problems
I will just stay with the ayurvedic with the turmeric

Go to the mighty dragons layer and grab the sugar dissolving potion 2.get a lemon from food kingdom  3.sneak to the giants castle and take a peace of the kings toenail  4.mix them together then go to the top of Mount Everest then leave it there for 2 weeks  Done four easy steps to lose weight over night

I like your videos. But are you capable of making one under 9 minutes? You drag everything out entirely too long
Hey guys we are starting a YouTube and I would appreciate it if some of y’all would went to subscribe... once we hit the good amount of subscribers we will post our first video 💕

Thank you so much
Ce discours en français?
This video and this channel are both complete garbage. It relies on nothing but clickbait to keep it afloat. I pity anyone who actually think it provides any real information.
Do you drink the whole thing or a cup of it??

Look up Nutrition Supplements that Professional Atheletes use. There are hundreds to try.
This video is so boring 💤💤
b o r i n g
Liked the video.  Watched on 1.5 speed to save a little time.
My diet consists of a lot of black beans, for protein and fiber. I drink a natural aloe vera drink, and lemonade. I eat a lot of apples, oranges, and blue berries. I do eat meat, a lot of chicken, and fish. And every once in a while eat a steak.
Go to 7.55 for the recipe
What aloe vera juice can i just use the plain normal aloe vera juice drink
Does it work?
I Loose 2 Kg/week with the following food and supplements: Supplements (3× per day): - preprobiotic (psylium husk)+ probiotic - Glucomannan tablets - Dandelion Juice - Milk whistle tablets - Brenneseln (urtica) Tablet - Multi vitamin and Mineral Tablet Food (small portion): - breakfast: Quark (dairy) + Fruit + walnuts - daytime: water, coffee with milk  -  Evening: tuna bean salad with no dressing  When feeling hungry: I drink water + dandelion juice + coffee and milk  I do this once a year for 3 to 6 weeks, rest of the year I eat "normally" some healthy food, some less and I usually take back weight.  In order to make the weight loss permanent I should eat smaller portion and healthier during the rest of the year but I guess I am no exception here. Still the cleansing/fasting works at 2 kg/week and I don't feel hungry.
Just liking all the health videos 💜
Natural nature is the healer nice video
Thank you
Great video. Big appreciations for your effort.
Can you just summarize this video in just 3 min alot of unnecessary information
Half a glass id not an exact measurement size. Half a glass can be 8oz or12oz or 3oz. Guess you gotta see what works.
Thanks for the advise it really work
Single night?  Really?
Good tips to follow
Should i eat dinner before this drink??
I appreciate this development because all videos are very benefiting
There's nothing delicious about aloe vera
which software you use for editing
Do you drink this every night?
1/2 cup water. 1 lemon. 1 cucumber. 1 Tbs aloe vera juice. 1Tbs grated ginger. 1 bunch of parsely. All into vitamixer (they say blender but impossible)
Liars. Where the drink?
http://nicolekelli.MyCTFO.com/ewlcp

Is it safe while breastfeeding?
I tried it and I went from 265lbs to 140lbs
7:52   for the ingredients
Just waisted 9 minutes of my life !!!
Two things: (1) In one day? Oh, c'mon, really now. But even if you did this for a few days, what else is it removing from your system? Is it safe and sane to do this, whatever it is? (I haven't gotten that far in the video yet.) (2) "Then the question evokes...." Er, you folks are using that word the wrong way. "Evokes" means to bring up a feeling, a memory, to make a connotation or allusion to something else. At least most of your videos try to be positive, though. :)

Hai,  in my country parsley hard to find. May i change with other things maybe?
Cucumber is a fruit not a vegetable.
Wait will this still work if I already have cancer?!?!?! Just curious.
Are we suppose to drink all of it because it seems to be a lot
I need it’s
or you could just drink a gallon or 2 a day.
Can you use lemon juce?
Did anyone else get the add that says stop watching youtube videos that try to help you lose weight but thay wont actually help you in the beginning?
Does this drink have an official name? I'd rather find a place near me that makes it than have to buy the ingredients all the time
Its not a recipy! Its a list of ingredients! Doesnt say how much of anything! Very interested but guess some H2O,a whole lemon, whole cuke, qt of aloe and fill rest of void with ginger?? Kinda thumbs down...
It is awesome. I'm gonna try it. Would you like to build a residual income? If yes, join me here www.gigicash.ws
Loved it!
Law of conservation of mass does not agree
4:14 for ingrediants
Bunch of mambo jambo.. All you need is a balanced diet and regular exercise.
my way is to boil cinnamon powder and water together then cool it down and put honey then drink half at night and half the next day for 10 to 20 days
Can u use bottled ingredients?
Doctors hate him! He loses weight with one weird trick >>>
A cucumber is a fruit, it had seeds, it is not a vegetable
Does it work?
Stop yapping so much and just get to the point!!
But I will start myself on it after work when u but everything I need

Sure sure right all true
Do I have to use a whole cucumber?
What a waste of my time
love this
Oh my gosh.  Get to the point
Is this just for the belly or all of the body? I'm so curious if it works all over the body :)
There was literally a ad telling me not to watch YouTube videos about weight loss😂😂
Does it also cure cancer and global warming?
Everyone's saying 'I think it is click bait ' cause who can actually be bothered
Guys watch animation movie no taking u to online Web
Haahaa about to try.

Omg thank u
Can we use salt or honey for the taste
Rhianna
all i was thinking was that bish don't know how to cut a cucumber
Don't forget to do core workouts as well don't just drink if your big around the waist or you'll have flab lots of flab
today am going to use this lets see how its work
This does works! I have been doing this for a few weeks and lost about 9 pounds. I go to the gym almost every morning also. But I add ingredients sometimes and make up my own at times. As long as you have that ginger cucumber and lemon with cilantro you are good. I add fruits in mine sometimes with Apple Coder Vinegar and honey. The taste is not good so fruit will make it taste a little better like a few pineapples or grapes or something. But this does works gotta eat right and exercise and keep a diet that works best for you.
6:38 aloe vera juice will reduce joint pains
Lotsa negative comments...shame...why bother commenting, just click to the next video, some people find this interesting and helpful.
Does this stuff even work?
After eating 8 tacoes, I'm back here!
When you click a video JUST to see how bad the clickbait is
In one night? Impossible!
Idiotic, at no point do you mention this is dangerous if you are on medications - especially if for the heart or if you are on blood thinners.
WONDERFUL

parsley means??
I mixed the ingredients and ate it. Why puree it? I have teeth! I am gonna be really MAD if it doesn't work. Is it supposed to replace my dinner or is it an after dinner thing?

7:55
Dah. Plz make short videos as v all know the benefits of the ingredients. I really wasted my 9mintz. Sorry, not discouraging you.
GOOD
What's the other option if there's no aloe Vera Juice?
a lemon? is it too much? too sour
Hey..  Please suggest Warm water or Normal water or instead of taking alovera juice can you please suggest
Instead of blending all this thing together can we boil them together and drink please let know ?
Remember self is everything
With peal tf not explaining the importance of it
The speaker states “Let’s Review” however the screen reads “Let’s Revise.” A typo which results in a contradiction in terms. Health advice should be one of the last things to commit such an error... Or am I unnecessarily overstating a simple mistake into something larger?
Do we really need a blender for all those vegetables or can we just slice or mince it all the way through or something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xi8ZYTFrb8
THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO AND I DO THIS FOR 7 DAYS EVERY MONTH. I COMBINED THIS WITH MIRACLE 0XY-CLEANSE 7 DAY TOTAL BODY CLEANSE AND DETOX. I TAKE 4 CAPSULES ON THE 1ST DAY AND I INCREASE 1 CAPSULE EVERY FOR 7 DAYS. I LOST 10 POUND IN 7 DAYS AND NOW I TAKE THE MIRACLE OXY-CLEANSE 2 TO 3 TIMES PER WEEK. WWW.THEONEMINUTEMIRACLEINC.COM

How come NO one commented if this actually works?...Or do I need to even ask?

To much bla,bla,bla.According this feminist film,looks like only male having obesity problem.Go to the street-author,to see the truth !!!
You know what really worked for me was every morning drinking 2 tbsp of apple cider a little bit of ginger powder and honey in a warm water on an empty stomach. It has really helped speed up my weight loss journey and is so good for my digestive system
So what can I substitute for the aloe Vera juice cause i have an allergic reaction to it.
I am trying this now. Even when the result would be 5 kg I would be happy👍😁
IM JUST DRINKING DIRT GARNISGED WITH A COUPLE OF FALL LEAVES LOL ,JK
I made drinks good Lord it tastes nasty I still drink it though
I heard from doctor that spinach & brocolli has a high iron on it..is it good advice to have this solution drinks which is high in iron. Doctor said that high iron is not good to our body because it is not goid to our pancreas..
do i have one full mix overnight or do i drink it over a couple of nights
I put myself on a 30 day challenge to drink this, but I must admit the parsley is a hard taste to get by.😞
idk if it will work but ok

Sounds good, but why,on Earth would you show someone wasting a lemon by smashing it with a tennis racket !?
i had 3 sleepless nights after boiling ginger,lemon and parsley boy i tell you, you will sleep in the toilet, but it works..
Before I go and buy all the things I don't have ( aka, everything on the list) does this actually work?

"Fasten" your metabolism?  I think you meant "hasten".
Gin and lemon with a slice of cucumber, now that's a diet !
Make one for kids
i don't use sugar, I use Stevia. The weight gain that's happened to me is because I've been put on over 100 rounds of Prednisone. I've always been very thin, size 5 since age 26 after I had my only child. Now I'm a size 14. I usually have no appetite and don't eat much often, eating nothing but water. Do you think this will work for me? Thank you.
Guyz it works rly i just did it for 1 month and from 75 kilos i went to 54 plus my waist and my whole body is much thinner now
Can't wait for payday.  I ran out of most of this stuff.  I can juice this in a minute with my NutriBullet Lean blender.  Thanks for posting.
the test said revise when the voice said review.
Does anyone else notice the before and after pics look more like a man and a woman. Does this drink make you transgender? I would need to tell my job if it does
Should we use this drink during winter season?

Has this worked for ANYONE?
I kept waiting for the punchline... this is a serious video? lol
Trying from months and u telling in one nyt...height of fooling ppl🙏
Cucumber? Blergh :( - Disgusting!  Ginger-Root? Yeah great (I put it in food sometimes, so that I can't taste it because I know it's good for your health!), but I don't like the taste of that either :( (if you know how to DISGUISE that, then I'll take it into consideration!)
I’ve been trying this and it actually works
But what if you don’t have ginger
I'm already in shape......stop laughing...round IS a shape
I did this and all of the items mentions in the recipe are stuck to my ceiling. :-(
No. Just no.

thankgod4themoney.com

I gained 10lbs while watching this video.
4:10 might help
Yap yap yap keep it short s+=$p@[
Thank you for sharing really love it.
Lemon, cucumber, ginger, aloe vera
like... come to the point woman.. i dont have ol day !
I have a sense you could make this in 1/2 the quantity, i.e., half a cucumber because it's very very distasteful and hard to swallow.  I made it during the day to save time before bed and refrigerated it.  That might have made it worse, but if I try it again, I will make a much smaller quantity and drink it quickly.  I don't see anyone extolling that it works; not a good sign.  They also don't say anything more about the exercises, i.e., how many, how long.
Yes i love it what u said and si i am doing it yes it works i am 52 years no one believed thanks for your good health care and it is very easy to do it yes if we want to look Younger than we  should try and start doing God bless u more deeper
Thank you so much.
Works great! Add mint. Leaves too gives. Super. Fast. Results.
For those people commenting “it will not work” well who cares .. it’s not going to harm u if it doesn’t benefit u because we all know these ingredients mentioned are not bad for u their all ingredients that are natural and healthy!

This vedeo is way too long and verbose.

Bright side, I like your videos. Would like them better if you didn’t beg for likes once every minute during the video. If your content shows effort and quality you will get the likes you deserve regardless.

#clickbait

Why lie nothing works overnight
4:11 start
🤣 One thing I have learnt from this video is to read the comments first and then watch the video! ;) Haha.. it's a great video though.. detoxification is actually the best remedy for health problems
It can also help for a pregnant women which we get after. Soon delivery afat belly stomach
amazing. .Thank  you
I don't know if this works or not but i do know this- ppl dont wake up in a week and say, oh snap I've gained 20lbs since last week.   The best way to lose weight is to commit to a lifestyle change: eat smarter and be active somehow and have patience. Dont eat better,  start exercising, lose 25 and then go back to your old ways.  I thought Kale would be one of the ingredients for this drink.
Can I skip lemon ??  As it didn't suits me
Yes  I like   the drink
When i saw that creepy girl with her stomach i nesrly backed away.  shouldbnt have been there at all.  So far ive heard what you need but not how to prepare it.  and aloe vera was never once mentioned
Aloe vera juice works great
Thank u dear
This sounds interesting, but the video is too long!
When I look at the time when they got to the ingredients the time was 21:49
can you also make it without aloe vera juice? cause where I live they do not sell it in the store
Please tell me if this works
Wow  best träning
After how much time take drink, After take dinner ??
this really works! thank you
that's one harsh ironic fact
I'm almost 90 pounds so I need this video👍👌
Can I skip alovera juice?
👌
then just drink more water and eat less.
Check out 36% food grade peroxide H2O2
8oz water 2tbl sp raw acv  2tbl do raw honey  at bed time.  plus drink plenty of water all day.  this is a real deal
I hv lost 10 stones I'm 8 stones now lol feel soo gud I m still having this drink thanks soo much
I'll give it a shot for a month.. not working = back to juice & water i guess :P
I ate like 3 chocolate bars until they finally listed the ingredients
can we take this drink after taking dinner n before going to bed? please tell the correct time
What if you don't have aloe Vera in ur country?????
Should i take this drink before meal or after meal???
omgggg its really working but very slowly when i regularly drink this every night after ten days i loose only. one inch from my waist   so guyz i suggest you to drink this but huh its really taste so bad
"In a single night" but then the video says "in a few days you will notice" Mmm
30 seconds video stretched to 9 minutes ? why oh why
Can i use in winter plzzz tell me
Thanks,  this is so helpful.  But do I need to filter it before drinking?
malnourished means a lack of food or a lack of food that is good for you, hence obesity.
I wonder how shocked people would be if they knew food companies put sugar in things that don't need it like soup, pizza, ground beef......
Even if you eat healthy there is something to be said for detoxifying your body. The number of years ago I went on a diet and detoxified my body at the same time. Since then I don't have any allergies anymore. My hay fever and other allergies are all gone!
Gonna try this tomorrow itself...
Deceiving people and luring views with a wrong title???why say single nite when it's not true?
hay
Thank u so.....much for sharing.
I dont have an blender
Thanks for this video.. Can we use fresh Coriander instead of Presley???? pls advise...
Thanks :)
try 2 squirts 🍋,2 teaspoon honey and 1/4 teaspoon castor oil. mornings on empty​ stomach. been doing this for a while. looking & feeling better. hope it works for you too. oh I drink a little warm water afterwards.
Blah, blah, blah upto 4:15 where you get the recipes.... and the summary review at 7:52.
we use salt in it
To stay healthy better don’t watch this video, as all said it’s click bait. Guys pls don’t follow what ever they say in YouTube, they make videos for money and add good captions to watch, they literally don’t care about others health and feelings except money. Note that these guys are not professional dietitians or any health consultants.
This was yum
Ginger is even the best agonist cold and vomiting . If is chewed or mixed , specially with  lime , honey and hot water it really relive cold .
It works. Don't ask for proof though, just go try it. Within 3 days the difference is very noticeable, however the vacuum pose thingy mentioned is the most important, but somehow least talked about in this video.
This is juet genious. Tried it for 18 days and gotta stop now. I m already to skinny. Lost about 3 pounds per night and went from 180 to 86 pounds. Can not find cloth that fit anymore. Also lost some height. Went from 204 cm to 137. Having a hard time to reach the top cabinets in the kitchen. Can not drive my car anymore and run out of ingredients. Might need some help soon. Gotta order some pizza to get delivered ...... ghee, hope to make it through the next couple days.
Let's  try
single night
Slowest video of all time do not watch
I will try it thanx my bedtime drink is chamomile mint and fresh ginger tea try it it works for me for losing weight and stay unhealthy
Well wy shed i not
This should be called how to waste 8 of a nine minute video.
So, I followed the instructions and  had this blended drink (more like pure) for 6 nights. The lemon with the skin is what makes the drink taste horrible...otherwise, it's kind of refreshing. While I am on a 1,200 calories a day diet and exercise every day - to my surprise - by the of the week I gained 5 pounds! BUT...I look great, feel energetic and dropped one size pants from 27 to 26.  Go figure.

Any alternate for parsley. We don't find here
7 minute intro - Jump to 7:48
I consume cold drinks and chips 😂
let me try this tonight..
Cukes, lemon - peels and all?
So it says in a single nite but at the end of the video she says in a few WEEKS !!!
Oh..  Pleaseeeeeee.....
COULD YOU STRAIN THIS...
It hardly does it in a single night when it takes a couple of days to start seeing any effects. This could have been a shorter, more concise video. I feel like I just sat thru an infomercial.
What can use in place of parsley....replay soon
Wonderful information, Do you have any recipes for blood Cancer ♋?. Please let me know!! birdye49@gmail.com Andrea Washington.. Thank you in advance

Hi, if I can't get parsley, can I use celery?  And how about aloe Vera, hard to get fresh aloe vera...
Healthful infor. for everyone...
the title says after 1 night but at end of video it says after some days
CUT TO THE CHASE!!!
Instead of Parsely can we use Coriander?
How much do you have to drink
I would like to try this… but, directions are a bit vague… I whole cucumber? How big of one? So… we need a ginger root to grind… I presume the "powdered" is no good?
They should add raw garlic
👍👍Happy Monday...😘😘😘😘
they took so long to actually get to the ingredients of the drink, I was yelling at the screen like "Just tell us!" lol
Can we edit this recipe cause I tasted it and me no like
What can be the substitute for parsley?
It's so sourrrrrrrrrrrr 😲
Ohh god it taste really, really bad yukhhh but i hope it worked. #firstdayofit
Can we prepare it and keep it in fridge ???
Laughing 😂is my favorite concept to be healthy
😊😊😊😊
what is the measurement of the ingredients?
It just gives you diarrhea... that's how you lose weight... 💩💩💩💩
First ingredient (mentioned at 4:17 - half way through the video): a lemon. second ingredient (5:07): a cucumber. number 3 (5:57): ginger. fourth (6:36): aloe vera juice. fifth on the hit parade (7:03): parsley. The summary we've all been waiting for (7:55): half a glass of water                                                                                     one lemon                                                                                     one cucumber                                                                                     one tablespoon of aloe vera juice                                                                                     one tablespoon of grated ginger                                                                                     a bunch of parsley                                                                                     blend it in a blender and drink it at bedtime.  There. I've just saved you 8 minutes.
do we take this in place of dinner? how long before bedtime should we drink it?
Tastes like death died twice! 😝
Interesting. It wouldn't work for me. I don't have kidney's...so I would just gain the fluid from drinking it I think. How does it taste? I am not sure if I made it for the family to try they would drink it.
What products I consume to stay in shape? Well, being a circle is pretty tough and it takes lots of will power... start your day with Nutella and end it with McDonald's every day. This will make your skin 15% less flammable.
Well, its sound good i am going to try it tomorrow. I hope it worked
im watching this while eating chocolate pudding
Do A Face Reveal Or Are You Keeping Your Face As A Secret ?

Answer at 4:13
Lies
This is long
Included in text form in the description below
Can anybody please comment if this works instead of talking about something else before I cluster charge you The comments telling you where the ingredients start are okay cause I didn't care much about what they had to say
The receipe starts at 7:50... in case you dont wants listen why works... :P
Well it works, crazy but true, a few people told me, about this long crazy vid, but, not to fast forward, I guess they thought no one told me, so you watch it too you fcuk, yeah it works if you stop having super meals and fast food, it takes longer to tell and see the results,  that's the key
NEVER will it happen over night.  Just doesn't work that way so change your title PLEASE!
Just tried this...its gross and i broke my blender
this is really cool🙂
Who's actually tried this?  Does it work?
Yeah, you will lose weight drinking this RIGHT before BED because you will be running to the bathroom all night. Parsley and cucumber alone have strong diuretic properties.. Add lemon.. Jesus...... Aloe has laxative properties so you might have a double whammy going on.
I ate grapefruitss everyday. Pineapple 3x per week.. and i made also a Parsley water,  i do stay in shape
Im gonna try this when i ear some money
And how much of sugar to make this light years close to "delicious"?
I created my own diet Breakfast = Cucumber Lunch = Lemon + Lemon Juice Supper: Lemon and Cucumber  the micro diet :D
Hi there I wold like to ask you that every night have to make half a glass of water one lemon and one cucumber and one tablespoon aloe Vera juice and one tablespoon of grated ginger and a bunch parsley?
my mom and me drink this disgusting water but we are losing weight!  Steps: First, get a gallon of water. Next, slice a cucumber with the peel on it and put it inside the gallon of water. Then, slice a yellow lemon and put the slices with the peel on it inside the gallon of water. Then, put a spoonful of ginger. Last, shake the gallon with the top on it and put it in the refrigerator and then the next day you can drink it
I want a method to prepare a fried chicken with 0 Calories
I'll try this but I seriously doubt anything will change
Do you put the entire lemon in the blender or just the juice? Also do you peel the cucumber or not?
why I can't take a screenshot of this
Can we use coriander instead of parsley? Please tell me
And the one with an allergy to aloe. Great...
Wel af you dowt hav a dlender😭
I'm enjoying my whisky  Good night
Acording to the thumbnail you transform your body from male to female by drinking this poison looking drink with a leaf in it🤔  Not recommended for non transsexuals

Thank u yar😊
Pls I don't have Aloe vera can I escape it or
let me wiki this for you guys:  "A 2015 review of clinical evidence about detox diets concluded: "At present, there is no compelling evidence to support the use of detox diets for weight management or toxin elimination. Considering the financial costs to consumers, unsubstantiated claims and potential health risks of detox products, they should be discouraged by health professionals and subject to independent regulatory review and monitoring."[1]  Detoxification and body cleansing products and diets have been criticized for their unsound scientific basis, in particular their premise of nonexistent "toxins" and their appropriation of the legitimate medical concept of detoxification. According to the Mayo Clinic, the "toxins" typically remain unspecified and there is little to no evidence of toxic accumulation in patients treated.[17] According to a British Dietetic Association (BDA) Fact Sheet, "The whole idea of detox is nonsense. The body is a well-developed system that has its own builtin mechanisms to detoxify and remove waste and toxins."[3] It went on to characterize the idea as a "marketing myth",[3] while other critics have called the idea a "scam"[18] and a "hoax".[19] The organization Sense about Science investigated "detox" products, calling them a waste of time and money".[2][20][21] resulting in a report that concluded the term is used differently by different companies, most offered no evidence to support their claims, and in most cases its use was the simple renaming of "mundane things, like cleaning or brushing".[2]  The human body is naturally capable of maintaining itself, with several organs dedicated to cleansing the blood and the gut.[22] Alan Boobis, a professor and toxicologist at Imperial College London, states:      The body’s own detoxification systems are remarkably sophisticated and versatile. They have to be, as the natural environment that we evolved in is hostile. It is remarkable that people are prepared to risk seriously disrupting these systems with unproven ‘detox’ diets, which could well do more harm than good.[2]  Scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning investigated the subject in 2008 and concluded that "Anyone interested in detoxifying their body might think about paying a little more attention to their body and less attention to the people trying to get their money... Why is it that so many people are more comfortable self-medicating for conditions that exist only in advertisements, than they are simply taking their doctor's advice? It's because doctors are burdened with the need to actually practice medicine. They won't hide bad news from you or make up easy answers to please you."[23]  Despite unsound scientific basis, detoxification is popular, and detoxification products and regimes have become a profitable health trend.[1] As with some other alternative medicine treatments, efficacy has been attributed to astroturfing, the placebo effect, psychosomatic improvements, or natural recovery from illness that would have occurred without use of the product."   you're welcome.

Be Fit enough to move yourself from place to place without being winded. Be able to walk 5 miles without a heart attack and be strong enough to carry your little people if you are a parent and they cannot mobilize. How that is shaped is up to you. This is the real things you need to be able to do because in the event of a Cataclysmic disaster where you have to walk away this about  what you need to be able to do without someone else carrying you.
Does this really work??? If it does someone please comment and tell me

Don't need to worry skip to 4:10
Awesome thanks for this..i 'll be doing this soon!
Went to look at the bibliography to verify some of these claims ... none ... nothing ... not one reference ... no idea where all these claims come from. Therefore "what a load of rubbish".
You can get the Aloe Vera Juice at the pharmacy at Walmart. I have gotten it there before. Going to try this.
If y'all just want to get straight to the ingrediets required for making the drink just go straight to 8:02
8:02 is where they revise
At 4:10 they show you on what ingredients you need. Yes, your welcome☺
8:01
i just stop having all types of sugar foods
Bla bla bla.. magic drink recipe on 4:12
Add in a clove or two of garlic as well. Too many health benefits to garlic as it stands, you might as well add it to this strange drink...
Any kind of side effects of this drink ?
Dam that was a long introduction
CLICKBAIT

Happy Diwali to you☺
just wasting time
I’m not hating but that’s not how the body works.
I'd like to share what's working for me. My food is simple and easy to prepare. And this is what I eat every day:   Breakfast - 2 cups tea (green tea or oolong), 2 whole wheat bread slices  Lunch - Fruits in a big bowl (mango, papaya, jackfruit, banana, kiwi etc) Dinner - Brown rice, fish & veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, squash, okra, tomatoes - any of these depending on my mood) :)  When I cook dinner, my food is always grilled or steamed. Fish only, no oil, no marinade, no salt, just tons of spices. Also I only snack on nuts & seeds. No soda, but I do drink wine every day after dinner. :) :)  With this lifestyle since 2012, I have never been sick even headache or fever. It was hard at first but with perseverance and discipline I made it. With regards to weight my BMI is 21 for 5 years now.
Whatever it's just a detox drink
I'll try it and see if it works. I have ginger in the fridge, need to shop for the rest. I need to get my swimsuit body back.
Things that will help you lose weight are a healthy diet, and exercise. Long and short of it, a healthy lifestyle.  No miracle pills or miracle drinks can do that in one night. Some may actually do more harm than good. Basically, if it seems too good to be true, then basically 99.99% of the time it is.
The ingrédients are lemon cucumber ginger and aloe vera juice
Guys 7:53 is the actual recipe for the drink there you go if you're bored to watch their blah blah blah You need not thank me. Just give a like
Hay, thanks for the share  and I'm subsc,ribing to your page.. 😘

I can't have Ginger in the house
How to use lemon ??? With skin or without skin?

I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. John 6:51

I needed this! Muchas gracias BRIGHT SIDE!
I drink a tea first thing in the morning that I make using ginger root, fennel seeds, and cumin, before I workout.
Kale, grapefruit, ginger, Apple, lemon and red grapes as a smoothie.  An absolute energy boaster and often times as dinner.  Very filling and no need for other food.  Plus, I sleep like a baby.
