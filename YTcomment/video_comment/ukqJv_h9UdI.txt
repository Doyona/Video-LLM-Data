Ew
Ew ew You are dity Coming back after5years
I also made this before, but what I did differently was add some peanut butter and one or two drops of IG regulator (It a bug birth control, but there are many different brands that make them). Overtime, it will dry up so I always check and replace a flesh one.  And the best part is that when the roaches eat the dead one they also get poison as well.
I’ve been making this poison since I found it 4 years ago.  My sister and I make this formula ever since.    It got rid of out roach problems but we change it every season just to make sure they don’t come back.
I will say this over and over this works like magic!! I always come to this whenever someone moves in to a roach infested place!
she somehow reminds me of my sister in-law
Does it not start to stink ?? I mean everybody knows what rotten eggs smell like.
I'm watching this bc I'm about to move into a house in the city and they be having roaches there. I'm going to disinfect the whole place and surrounding area bc I ain't messing with that.
I recently done this but i dont see the roaches attracted to this i followed all steps i hope i did this right i guess ill give it a few more days
I have had a bad experience. One crawled on my back when I was falling asleep . I woke up and searched how to eliminate roaches 🪳
This is the only graphic Content that I like to see :)
Thank You. Los Angeles.
When I do this trick do I just leave the thing alone even after I feel like the roaches are gone? Or do it throw it out at some point?
I added mad sugar and I still can’t get it to turn to playdough. It’s still flaking
You should eat some
I wanted the roaches to leave. I didn’t want to murder them! I blame you 😂
well I just finished putting the bait all over the kitchen and in the bathroom of my apartment. It’s insane how much rent we have to pay to have these little bastards everywhere, landlords never take action so hopefully this will work!
You so damn dramatic ?!?!?!
Do I have to use eggs?? 😩 They're so expensive theses days
Shawty too animated, didn’t even finish the video lol
😂😂😂😂😂 water bugs sound to too friendly. You are a roach
Can I ask what is reasoning behind the process that once you’ve done this they don’t come back I tried this and after a week I never saw another and it’s been two years
I’ve been trying to get rid of these Oriental roaches (aka water bugs) for 7 months now. I’ve tried boric acid with lure, caulking and sealing all holes, having pest control come out countless times, doing my own spraying and pest control, and keeping the apartment spotlessly clean, and nothing has worked. I see these almost every single day and a lot of times I see as many as four per day in my apartment. They even wash out all over my clothes when I do laundry because they are in the water lines. 🤢  I’m about to try this as my last resort. I’m praying that it works but nothing else has so far. If this doesn’t work I’m moving out as soon as my lease is up. I can’t deal with this anymore. This is in California by the way.
This video is the best ..I’ve sent soooo many people this video cause this shit works ! Thankyou .
Has anyone seen “Joes Apartment” ????? It’s great movie for all who has or doesn’t have roaches ... protect your home😂🤣🤣
Ill have to try this
Before I do this I need to know .... I really just let them eat ... and if I do what happens they just leave . And go where 😭😂 Im so scared I don’t want to do this and wake up to thousands of roaches sitting in my kitchen
😬
What is the Boric acid for? I didn’t see you use it in the video
From New York
Hopefully this works just as good on Texas roaches as it does on New York roaches cause these mfs are irritating
I stay coming back to this video. It really works!
Gasoline and a match work great too
Hi I'm from South Africa and roaches is everywhere in my house how can I get rid of them it's clean but they don't give up
Wholly shit 9 years ago this made me subscribe lmao 🤣
I wish I could see the dislikes
Wow thank you so much going to try this for sure 😬👌 dying to get rid of them 🪳😊👌I use to live in the Bronx but now I’m at California thank God but I thought I was living back in  New York 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 when I saw roaches 🪳 is everywhere 😫
I never heard of using eggs before. May have to try. Tulsa, Ok.
Seriously? Just grab it with a paper towel and flush it. No no need for all the screaming and drama.
Can I substitute baking soda for the boric acid?
I  m from  warren ohio  I have roches   they are biting me
When do I remove the poison? Or does it stay for a while?
This really works! I watched this video back in May. Made the mixture and placed them around in June. By the second week I noticed that they were pretty much gone. Haven’t seen any since then. Since the weather is changing I’m going to make more this week. Thank you!
I'm going to try this and I'll let you know if I see any change
Save your eggs and use flour sugar and water with boric acid
To much
Omg she’s so stupid she made my day I couldn’t stop laughing !!!!
I’m just wondering, do they die right there or do they leave after they eat them die somewhere else?? I’m just curious before I would have to clean up a big, disgusting mess!
Who else is here because they live at Valora at Homewood in Alabama? Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️
I recently moved to a new apartment and let me tell you. ROACHES ARE MY WORST NIGHTMARE 😭😭 my first night here I couldn’t sleep, and had severe anxiety. I should of been happy and excited. It’s not too bad but seeing them at all drives me crazy. Will definitely try this!!
You don't need eggs the sugar and boric mix work
A product that’s good to use is orthene fire and ant killer
Thank you I’m trying this right now and laying down the stuff
Thank you
When you say they become a crowed with the batch… do they only stay in that one area in the kitchen? I would hate to see so many roaches crawling in the entire apartment for a tiny batch behind the fridge or the corner of the kitchen
Big roaches in Los Angeles would go through my kitchen door from the backyard…. Now I have baby and small roaches in my kitchen and won’t go away. Not even raid spray helps. I really hope this helps plus I hope I can successfully do this… I’m tired of it!
I’m in Texas and they are a different breed. I read some comments where you had to wait a couple of weeks . Mines disappeared overnight. I added some to the cabinets and drawers like she did and left. I had a bit left over so I just left the rest in a bowl and left it on my kitchen counter .  It was a party in my kitchen last night . Bought Tim’s I woke up they where all gone . Hopefully for good after a couple of weeks .
You're hilarious!
I constantly talk a d share this video! Love you!!!!
Girl your funny ty
You sound like Liza koshi lmaooo
Yes fighting the urge to kill them is the hardest because I freak out and want to just go crazy with my chancla too 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Does anyone know where left overs should be stored?
Made the concoction today, I was hype putting it around my apartment. Like I can't live like this, fingers crossed praying!
That why can't you leave us alone was a moment
I’m so disgusted I’m in New York and suddenly got roaches I want to throw everything out … I am so scared
About to move into an apartment I have never seen but signed a lease for, preparing for the worst, thank you for the easy to follow video.
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Detroit Michigan I live in a apartment and they have them fu##ing beings I have asthma and a kitty that pesticides are not a option so I’ll be trying this thanks for the tip now the disgusting 🤢 story about them is cooking and one was on the ceiling and fell into my food I threw it out the whole meal ate a sandwich I’m bleach overkill everything has lids now if can find a bedbug solution to would be awesome haven’t got them yet cause I’m cautious but people are desperate here to get help me many blessings and blessings to you for your videos
does anyone have an idea why the balls got hard after 1 days of having them , they didn’t become play dough like?
I was 7 when this video was out I think
Well 👀  after working all night I saw one roach and here I am.
I’m getting in it now!!!!!!! Thx!
Will it work in an apartment in which the roaches may be coming from another unit?
Thank u so much im willing to try anything at dis point my husband is constantly spraying roach spray but a day later der back uhh can't stand it gonna try dis tho bless ur heart 🙏❤
Roaches are so stressful and annoying
Advion cockroach gel bait...It was recommended by a friend; just get ready to sweep 'em up in the morning. It works!!!
Just moved into my apartment 2 days ago.  First thing I did was tried to make coffee.  5 minutes after I turned on the coffee maker, a total of 8 roaches crawled out of the cabinets and descended onto my coffee.  I'm going on vacation next weekend, but I will try this and put it around my apartment.  Hopefully, they'll have their death party while I'm away.
Does this also work for ants?
From Texas an the girl above me is nasty 🤣🤣 an I get her Roches an I act just like you do when I see them grrrr
Me looking at my door when watching this video
Did she got rid of the egg white?? What a waste
Annoying woman, useful method i will try
I started seeing roaches 1year ago in my place, been living roach free for over 7yrs in my apartment 😭😭😭😭😭😤😤😤😤🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢😡😡😡😡
Man she crazy
Yes aà
You're not suppose to cook the eggs lol
perhaps you could redo the video over minus the screaming or at least caution people to turn there volume down  it may be what all the thumbs down .
Mines was still crummy so to make it the playdough means I have to add more sugar ?? Please anybody answer
Does it start to stink because of the egg ?
Ill definitely be trying this ASAP
you're funny
Do mice die if they eat it?
Trying this tomorrow
i gotta move cause of this issue, I aint got time or energy with my thyroid disease to deal with this issue
Yes I do talk to cockroaches too
Trying this today
I live in California High Desert and we have flying roaches, freaks me out!!! Big ones!!
Is it that serious,  seems like this is a mentally I'll symptoms instead of killing roaches
0:06 for real tho. I feel you. 0:54 I feel you my guy. 1:16 for real tho
👍👍👍👍
“Extremely graphic images “...its not the cartel beheading people but hey 🤷🏾‍♂️
You overreact so much
Audio is NSFW
Thank you 😐 never had a roach problem till we moved to these apartments but I will get rid of them for good! It’s my house!
Yeeeeeea that shit doesn't work AT ALL!!
Im s free Man hurray hurray no compro misea
Its ok its last moment.Its agonizing.Yiu cant do anything about it
One time (I live in South Texas) I woke up to a roach in my hair in my bed. I scrambled out of bed, it scrambled away too, and I threw up...... yeah. So I’m gonna use essential oil spray every night now, even though we recently had a guy come out with chemicals
whats the song playing in the background?
Please if I use this method won't it attract sugar ants because of the sugar in it
GIRL FUCKING SAME. I'll deal with rats better than I'll deal with roaches. Also; don't let ANYONE let you think that their "water bugs"... They tell you that shit if they know you don't like ROACHES. Cause they ROACHES.
cockroach, one that lived 55 million years before the first dinosaurs. Search in google guys
I live in Harlem the projects and there is holes in the walls my roaches 🪳 are never ending I need to seal the holes and do this mixture! Wish me luck
I’ve used this in my car before when I had roaches in there from moving boxes that they were hiding in and let me tell you I was disgusted when I walked out to the car at night and saw them mfkers everywhere. They all died. I haven’t seen a roach since. I just put the mixture on a plate and it took like a week and they were all gone  ✌🏽🤞🏾
Do you have to clean it up eventually?! Like does the egg get nasty 😂
You remind me of Zendaya. Good tip
Omg when I was little and lived in Puerto Rico the roaches where the size of two quarters and could fly...
Soo here in SA they don't sell that fancy boric acid you used, will normal boric do the trick as well or no?
Are you tired of Roaches I didnt know what to do so i started praying about it i wanted them out of my apartment for some reason a thought came to me to spread pepper around I did and i dont hardly ever see a roach any more and i had plenty of them. Not making this up. Pull your refrigerator and stove out and sprinkle pepper underneath them spead it heavy and around the bottom of your cabinets and any other place you been seeing them if you have a trash can in the kitchen spread some pepper in the trash can to you will soon see them disappear. im being honest i hardly ever see a roach any more. They hate pepper. When you see it works for you let everyone know about it. It works.
What’s that song name lol
is the roaches for me
Thank you for this video! I prayed this really works. The roaches im dealing with are coming from my NASTY neighbor!😡 I did some research before I came to your video. I made the stuff last night but I also added some neem oil to it. I was told they do not like the smell. Well, we shall see what happens.
I’m trying this out now! I’ll update in a couple weeks or a month. Is anyone else so paranoid with roaches that whenever you see a slight movement out of the corner of your eye even if you’re not at home you jump cause you think it’s a roach.. 😂😭 I’m going crazy. I just moved into a new apartment not knowing it was infested with roaches.. I’m hoping this works!
You are my TYPE OF GIRL
Ghekkos are a good friend but they may not do so well outside a tropical climate.  Arrived home late one night with shops closed and just a packet of soup to eat.  Sat down do eat and a spoon-sized cockroach dropped into my bowl.  I didn't eat that evening.
In a parrallel universe the roach actually squishes her while in agony
Hello  Did you put the acid boric you put on the table before start the mixing  or just the powder roaches killer
I'm a poor ghetto piece of shat living in the protects. I had roaches everywhere . Even falling from the freaking ceiling.  I literally woke up with 5 hours ago with one roach crawling into my ear hole. I walked to 7 miles to Walmart and got the eggs and sugar with my food stamps. I Stole the boric acid at self check out, And RAN back home.  And now my life pretty much sucks......  But without roaches
I LOVE THIS VIDEO <3 :) YOU  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU YOU R SO FUNNY :) I LET MY SCHOOLMATE STAY WITH ME FOR A MINUTE WITH HER SON AND HER LITTLE GROSS FRIENDS.  THIS TOTALLY WORKED I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT AND I DARE THEM TO COME BACK . (THE LITTLE GROSS FRIENDS)             I LIVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE BUGS ARE HALF THE SIZE OF YOUR.  I ALWAYS TELL EVERYONE ABOUT THIS WHEN THEY HAVE THIS PROBLEM.
You should see the roaches in Brazil, I remember my dad using 2 whole cans of raid and the thing was still alive, he used a hammer in the end to splat that mofo. They are unnaturally massive
2:11 is where she actually gets to the point of the video.
Thanks iwill try your way ...
From New York. Going to have chocolate milk and finding roaches in the chocolate syrup.  😬🤮
YEAH THIS WORKS GUYS!
The egg added to the mix, does it smell all together??
Texas omg I’m trying this!
7 years later and in here because I turned my kitchen light on at 11pm and a roach was on my sink chilling!!!
it works... very well and quickly  in SLC  Utah  10/14/2020.     :)
How long after should I see results? I did the paste but couldn't find that bottle of boric acid you use. I instead went to the pharmacy and they had a boric acid that was for cuts that needs to be dissolved in water. And I used that, I did that 3 days ago and I've yet to see it work. Any tips you can offer me I would appreciate it ☺️. TIA.
Fairy crack 😂 💀  But uh. I ain't sticking my hands in places I can't see. One of those fuckers touches me, I'm grabbing my fur kids, throwing on some boxers, setting the place on fire, and me and my fur kids are gonna walk away and live in a goddamn tent. Fuck. That.
Sees the warning  .2 seconds later "Fuck!" Was NOT disappointed 😂👌🏼  You earned yourself a new subscriber and I don't even know what ya channel is about
The first time o did this, it worked but NOW, IT OSNT WORKING ANYMORE. OMG!!!
too much cussing to watch. thumbs down
Lmfao
😂😂😂😂
Grow up
I'm from Bk NY and man I will try this
U basically made them breakfast 😂
But does it make the house stink?
No JUST use soap dishwasher soap like Dawn put in some water leave out in the NIGHT
I like you shameless Maya  enjoyed this video wow your pretty and funny and thanx for the tip #newsubscriber😂😂😂
Coming back after 5 years of not having roaches in my apartment. All thanks to this video!
Los Angeles County in California. My parents left an apartment to my boyfriend and me because they moved and the lease was still on going. I needed roommates to afford the rent. In the beginning we had zero roaches because my mom kept the place clean. We were able to keep up with that, but they our roommates girlfriend moved in. Our roommate became such a slob with her. They would pile dirty dishes in their room, cook and leave the pots out until they molded up, they left crumbs everywhere, but they refused to clean. My boyfriend and I decided to look out for ourselves and only clean the mess we made. BIG MISTAKE!!!! The roaches completely took over!!!! They were out and about no matter what time of day. At night, when I turned on the kitchen and living room lights they would cover about 50% of the floor. It was a horror show. As soon as they moved out the roaches decreased to a minimum. We decided to move out any ways. Now I’m trying to roach proof my new place.
Did this work for anyone I live in apts that’s infested
Video: warns about bad language  Me: rushing to stop watching the video  Video: what the fu--  Me:😭😭Nooooo
If you see this it is Aug 2020.  It’s been 3 days and I still see roaches.  How long does it take
Can i put in my bed and dresser too? And does it start to smell? And i wonder if they go away then die. Id hate to see a bunch of dead roaches
Mine didn't eat this egg sugar and boric concoction at all. It might depends on the kind of roach.
Video starts 2:10
Sounds like a good recipe based on my reading and experience, but cut out the screeching and cursing and it could have been distilled to 2 min long.
Everytime they disappear I think they're gone then when I wake up at night to go pee....turn on the kitchen light....and there they r, staring at me like I interrupted a party😳🥴😫....the other day one of them actually came out to literally WATCH me cook🤮🤢🤮...I talked to it & said "r u serious....so ur just gonna watch me cook really?!" It didn't say anything back, ooh thank God🙄
The sweet death my chanckleta doesn't offer, jajajaja
Girl, why are you not wearing gloves and throwing away that bowl and fork? Didn’t you just use boric acid?
Exterminator?!!!
I’m pretty sure you should be wearing gloves when handling that.. it may not be deadly for humans but it’s just one of those things you dont want inside your body
👍 thank you for sharing this I will try this
I have it 1. Be clean  Or move out or get some help
I like her vide. She’s funny 😆
I’m like you, I hate bugs and roaches ...I would get sick and freak out when I see one .
Me vs roaches in a nutshell
It's overrr for me , An army of Roche's have arrived in my house , literally an army , there's the Calvary unit , the Archery unit , the foot soldier unit , The flying unit and don't forget the Commanders and generals .  I'm worried about The flying troops  .It's over 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I'm packing my things and goodbye .
You grossed me more then cockroach
Now I know how to make diy playdoh
Water bug sounds too friendly 😂😂😂
video starts at 2:10
They are really crazy
Wish I could give this video 100 likes, instead of just one.
Hello. I saw in the beginning of the video you had 100% boric acid. Than you used a yellow roach killer ? Which one did you use
Trashy mouth worse then roaches!
Jamaicans nah Waste egg 🥚 fi kill roach
*odnt add sugar it solidifies on the surface and makes the poison egg too hard for the vermin to smell or eat, don’t add sugar.
1 second in i was annoyed as fuck.
YALL THEY WERE ON MY TOOTH BRUSHES AND SKINCARE,I HATE THEM WITH A PASSION😭😭😭😭
Oh man, I have a cat so I can't use this.  And I JUST cleaned up a nest that was stinking up my kitchen!  Gonna dust some DE to keep them gone!
Water bugs are roaches.
Came here because a roach jumped at me
Viroaches Cholera Virus stupod Diabl👹 of life died more than CoVidied 19 forgotten of all universes existed,. KILL THEM ALL THE SERPENTS,. and all alike.🧐🧐
there is a cockroach in the wall
watch your language
I think she maybe on to something looks like a good idea.
That’s me at the beginning of the video 100%.
I’m going to try this! I’m tired of these bastards 😞 I even closed off my drains when I don’t use them. I want them gone and wish whatever neighbor it is to just move. I’m so over this... now I gotta sleep with a sandal by my bed just in case 😒
Will this work outdoors
Me too maya, me too.
am I the only one who is not getting the play dough no matter how much sugar I add 🤦🏾‍♀️
I’m moving into this apartment because it’s cheap. In the reviews they state there is a roach infestation. So i will be doing this prior to moving in I hate roaches!
we hired an exterminator but they keep coming back
The worst is when you live in the building with multiple rooms and your neighbors are fucking dirtbags and don't clean their rooms I clean my room top to bottom everyday but it doesn't matter when you have dirtbag neighbors so obviously I'm moving the fuck out of this building but until then I'm going to use this to my advantage and hopefully it will work
Is it supposed to get hard after a day? or stay soft?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
SMH
Dam I never thought of poisoning food
dude. roaches in places along the equator grow 10x that size, no cap. they don't ever stop growing. i'm fucking scarred. one just flew onto my desk just now and danced on my fucking antbait. my mom smacked it and some of its juices got splattered on my desk and that fucker still had the capacity to run off somewhere else. fucking scary
That's nothing. I've seen a roach the size of a tv remote and the antennas on that thing were sooo long
Ew😥
Where can I buy the powder?
this is Reggie from Maryland. that was great,,
At least they eat good before they die
Man but have y’all seen Florida roaches tho? They call them stupid shit like water bugs or palmetto bugs but they are ROACHES. Big asf. And they fly.
Why’d you come out from down unda there at the end? Lol
Just know I made mine tonight hottest no more roaches coming up
Just moved in to an apartment. These bitches are everywhere! I was laying in bed when I seen one just casually walking around the pillow I was resting my head on. OH HELL TO THE F NOT! I'm making a big load of this and gifting some to my neighbors. WE will ALL get rid of these dirty little creatures. I hope it works!
Wait does this work for Miami Roaches too or what??🙏🙏🙏🙏😰
I grew up with those in my house on long island. I hate them!
you have the face to love Hi im Jaz
I mixed the powder with flour, sugar, bacon grease, and a little bit of onion and old vegetables (to give it a smell).  I put the "cookie dough" everywhere.  3 days later, I stopped seeing live roaches and started finding lots of dead ones.  Now the war is over and the roaches are gone. Strangely, not having those disgusting things around seems almost boring.
Gloves...... 😳
I'm in Sacramento, Ca and my mom and I have roaches I don't really care too about them but they are kind of disrespectful.
Jacksonville Florida, actually had just gone on YouTube for some tips on unclogging a toilet using hot water, ended up splashing some random roach that just KEPT MOVING AS THE WATER MOVED!! It was horrific and I never saw it after I came back for more water.
They look cute to me but i live in ireland and have never seen  these little golden beasts ever.
Damn, that was a fat roach
She’s my whole mood 😭😭😭
This workrd GREAT on the roaches in my corner of Texas. Easy to make, easy to set out, 36 hrs later, not I roach anywhere. Thank you Maya
I live in Florida and we get what they call palmetto bugs. Which is a GIANT cockroach! One night while sleeping I felt something crawling on my face. It was a giant a** roach! We freaked out and treated the whole house. And these things FLY! But I’m so terrified over that incident every time my hair touches or  tickles my face I think the worst.
Can I use borax instead of boric acid I couldn't find it here
Thanks I tried it and it really worked 🤗
Bruh your reaction was literally mine 😭
This is a lot of work, but hey, whatever works. What use to work for me when I lived in an apartment was a 3-step process. First, roach bombs. I would bomb the entire house placing MULTIPLE bombs in each room, usually 2-3 and one in each kitchen cabinet with them closed and then letting the place sit for 12 hours. Second, I'd then follow-up with those gel bait traps that essentially works as your homemade poison. The roaches would feast on the gel - not sure whats in it or what attracts them - but they'd take it back to their families and friends and the entire colony would die. Worked for ant infestations, too. Lastly, I would clean my house real good, particularly the floors and surface areas like countertops with a bleach, ammonia, and lysol mixed solution. Be careful, the fumes can cause headaches and for you to pass out. I use to do this in apartment buildings, living next to people who had roach infestations. They would still have an infestation after my treatment strategy, but I wouldn't. I would never see another roach ever again. EVER!!!!
I patch up all holes,then put poison food,bye bye roaches
I dont think its working bc mine is drying hard so i dont think they can eat it and i used the same stuff you used
Alright, well at this point I'm feeling very grateful that my LA roaches don't get bigger than my boyfriend's thumbnail, thank GOD. But.... these buggers have cost me sleep. Fuck, I've even had nightmares. We've had an exterminator spray twice. I've put sticky pads everywhere, (underneath every single appliance, on counters, the stove, ground, cupboards) but it's like they've learned that glue stick smell = death. Put out a buncha bait traps, they've been working alright. But I've just killed three after switching on the light, it's nearly 2 am, I'm TIRED of this shite. Imma use all the reinforcements and buy some boric acid ASAP and sprinkle your magic death dust EVERYWHERE and be grateful I don't have a pet. 🙏
Soo glad I’m not the only one that talks to the cockroaches!! I love telling them as I spray their favourite hiding places “you can run u little brown fu^*ers, but I’m here to spray y’all to your roach heaven! Die muthafu^*ers!!”
I just made this mid-morning. I'm not seeing anything coming for the chum. If this doesn't work. I'm going to spam the comments with a bunch of hurtful comments.
im dealing with whats close to being overrun with them no matter what I see them everywhere do you have to use sugar
maybe I used too many eggs I tried this twice using 3 eggs and it keeps turning watery instead of clay like
I'm going to try this. I never ever had roaches until I sold my house and moved to an apartment, landlord sprays but it doesn't last long. I never have food out, all things are in air tight containers or the fridge and I clean with bleach but still roaches. Ugh.
UPDATE: Thanks for this video , I dont live with roaches just moved into my apartment all was new except the stove soon as I got in bam i would see a few a week, did your solution and BAM gone gone gone no sign of them the bitches moved out or all died thanks so much for this video
What I do is I smash it with a shoe and then clean it up
I am so happy for this video
didnt she play onna movie
What worked for me . Was to put a stick of Dynamite in the kitchen and every room and then i blew the whole fucking house up. KABOOOOOOOOM! Im now currently homeless .
Gurl I live in a basment aprtment had a flood got that done now there everywhere
Fairy crack 🤣🤣😂😂
How do you store the rest of the batch? In the fridge or room temp??
You are stupid acting like that
You are not fhunnny
Why did you waste the egg white
Any updates?
So what was the boric acid used for?
The recipe starts at 2:15
does anyone know whr in south africa can i get Boric acid? I went to clicks n they dnt have
You guys this totally works!! When you first make the poison they start coming out like crazy!! First 2 weeks. Then I threw away the old poison and made new one & placed it again & they were completely gone by the 3rd week! Be patient & have faith 😂 Im roach free 🙌🏼 -if you have any pets be extra extra careful where you place them!
This is the second time that I have seen the egg yolk along with the boric acid and sugar is there a certain percentage of boric acid and sugar that I should use?
Do I take it out after some time has passed? Or do I just leave the yellow balls there?
Sweet slow death. 😭
Does it get hard? If so will the roaches still eat it?
Don’t need eggs or sugar. Boric Acid, water and peanut butter as a peanut butter bait.   Spray that works 32oz bottle 1oz neem oil, 1oz lemon eucalyptus oil, 1 tbs diatomaceous earth. Shake and spray. Spray areas they frequent. Diatomaceous earth causes them to desiccate. The live ones will eat dead ones. They will go back to their nest and all die.
SILLY!!!!!!!
all of a sudden I started seeing a crazy amount of roaches in our apt, our landlords were of no help so I thought, “eh what the heck it’s worth a shot” to try this. And so we did, on 8/25 I bombed our apt w the orange raid bombs you can find at Walmart and target. After letting the bombs do their thing we came back to clean and made this mixture from video. Next I proceeded to put little amounts in the corners of cabinets, under counters, under sinks etc where the mixture couldn’t really be seen. The first and second day I didn’t notice a difference, and on the third day the roaches seemed slower, after the fourth day it was like a massacre had happened. Roaches dead everywhere, it was disgusting but at the same time relieving. Today is 9/21, almost a month since day 1 and I can report that I have NOT seen anymore roaches 🙏🏼 🗣
This works! I love your personality. Had me rolling!
I deep cleaned my entire condo today and then sprayed poison everywhere I could think they may have been hanging out. I even made a peppermint essential oil spray for my countertop. Well, fast forward  it's nighttime now and I just walked into my kitchen, flipped on the light and saw two different types of cockroaches crawling on my cabinets. 🤢 So damn gross! I'm desperate to get rid of these nasty pests. I'm going to make this recipe tomorrow and hope this works. I'm desperate to get rid of them.😢
thx 4 nothing
Wow that accent didnt expect it
Thanks sweetheart
Now I need a video on how to kill fruit flies!
Thank you some much for this recipe. The first night of placing this recipe around my house I saw results. Believe that this really works!!!! I tried some many different recipe. This is the only one that really goods!!! Thank you!!!!!!
This video is trash. Watch the REAL video about killing roaches, made by the legend JT fuller: https://youtu.be/Z3rdkOiliLI
When I lived in the east coast I thought the roaches were bad no come to Arizona the sewer roaches are the size of your ring finger
It works I watched your video in 2016  and tried it and it worked
In Texas we have flying roaches that are super aggressive.
Y'all thought that shit was a excuse for roaches! *They don't die, they multiply!* Now when a roach take flight You know by the fact That house is not yours anymore! We Running On The track!😂😂😂
I swear last night there was a huge roach and it was probably the size of a small dog ☠️☠️☠️
Does anyone know the best way to store this for later use and what's the shelf life before I should toss this bait? Thanks Maya thanks Youtube
I’m so scared to try this method. I recently just saw one on my kitchen counter and freaked out bc I know how bad these things can get . 😭 I guess I will do it and trust the process. 😫 Oh i just want them to stay out of my home 🙏.
Im so paranoid about roaches being in my bed and this obe time i was just watching tv and eating and on my pillow theres this little fuckin brown dot crawling and it was a FUCKING ROACH ON MY PILLOW and i was done until that point i took all my sheets off my bed and sprayed roach spray EVERYWHERE. But they still keep coming back. I swear thier like the spawn of the devil.
Does this work on all roaches?
Girl try lasting in Texas trust me u would wanna move!!!! Like they are HUGE you need to Google them once they made me vomit for real in my mouth a lil
Girl im the as as u!!! Literally I picked up my cheer bag from a box it was on top of and there was a alive freaking big cockaroach I literally cried and asked my mom to kill it that's how scared I am like don't need with me with cockaroaches
I've done this over n over. They got wise to it fast
She's a hottie.
Sounds right...gonna try it. Thank You to all those who tried it and commented.
I was renting a house in Atlanta when I  started to catch glimpses of a roach here and there. I would wake up and leave work before the sun came out. One groggy 4am, I sit down on the toilet and,crawling on the floor in front of me, was one brown roach. I grabbed some TP to smash it. Already creeped the Hell out, I look to the toilet roll to find a hallmark extra large Atlanta black roach on the floor beneath it. Now Paranoid, l look up and, on the wall, was a large brown roach. Those things are EVERYWHERE if you walk outside at night. Does not matter where you are. I went to the kitchen to get some roach spray. When I turned on the light, by surprise because I didn't turn on the hall light, what could have been a hundred roaches of all sizes, mostly German, immediately scattered, as though they were never there. I found the mother colony behind the fridge. This moment really answered why I had to commit a full blown spider genocide, inside and out, when I first  moved in. There was a detatched garage, with a few black widows and hundreds of brown widows, wall to wall, ceiling to floor and every shelf in between. I had to start at the back and work my way out because, when they got hit with the poison, they immediately began descending from their webs and, all the eggs started to hatch... Theres a few hundred small spiders in every egg sack and most webs had multiple sacks. So, please do imagine, with every pass, 20-30 large spiders gracefully descending by their Web, while their thousands of babies hatch and follow suit. When I had when I reached the front, I stepped out and closed the garage door. Every single spider, dying too slowly for comfort, mostly crawled their way out from under the garage door. A fair number crawled out from the top and sides. Did I mention there were spiders on the inside back of the door and, all over the ceiling? I sprayed the living hell out of the entire door perimeter until it was dripping and pooled up the poison along the bottom... Have you seen the movie Arachnophobia? It was kind of like that. Unfortunately, I learned, the hard was, how well hundreds of hungry venomous spiders could combat a large roach population.
Suspend SC and Gentrol. You will never see a roach, much less any other bug, ever again.
I wonder if I can put this on the outside of my trailer. I don't having roaches crawling around inside. Just every now and then we might find a big one in a corner somewhere. They seem to be coming in from outside. Should I use this outside around the trailer.?
You are so beautiful!
Why do we have  to see disgusting picture of roaches please don't do this
I suggest mixing with peanut butter. Nuke the pb for about 30 or 40 seconds and mix it in so its easier to mix with the eggs and borax. And speaking of which diatomacious earth or dte is a better healthier alternative to toxic borax so if your pet or kid gets near it, it wont hurt them. Put some in the corners of windows and doors outside so no insects come in. I roll them in balls and put them where i can replace them but after 1 night we only saw 1 bug the next day and thats a shock in my moms house. Now the house is clean and no more pests! Works for ants, spiders, bed bugs and fleas too. Im from Brooklyn in Atl now. Had to let these southern roachs know the deal plus they fly down here too good luck and be blessed ❤
Watching these because I fucking STEPPED ON ONE, they can walk around, they can eat the fucking crumbs, whatever I live in a ny apartment, BUT THESE ROACHES REALLY DONT CARE ANYMORE THEY WALKING AROUNDDDD LIKE ITS THEIR MANSION. Time. To. Kill them all.     Our apartment sometimes bring some guy to put poison but that shit never works. Theres so much cracks in the walls I knowwww thats like their base. Im gonna E6000 glue that shit up and wait for them all to die in the walls. Cant get out to find food if I blocked you in 🤷‍♀️
Grow up,  big baby drama queen
I hate them to SO MUCH THERE GROSS SCARY AND UGLY lol ower rouches are 5inches
Why go to as much trouble boiling eggs, ect.  3 teaspoons of Roach powder (Boric acid based) mixed COMPLETELY with 1 teaspoon of peanut butter to make bait. Place inside of a small box, such as a fish sandwich box from McDonald's, making sure there are cracks for roaches to enter. Place baits where you see roaches, but away from pets and children. Replace bait as needed. Also good for ants.
I got roach in my room its 2am I cant sleep it entered the wall and I cant kill it I'm scared cuz I dont know if it the regular roach or the flying roach those sacred the life out of me I'm scared it having babies in the wall its 2am I cant sleep
What I did was peanut butter with boric and sugar and made them into paste and scatter all around the kitchen and room and some in the bathroom. I see most of them gone. Unlike before I did that, I see small roaches crawling everywhere...walls, sink, tables, floor. It's like I want to ran out of this house. I still need more to kill and I might try the eggs too.
What if there are mice AND roaches, and the MICE keep eating the bait before the roaches can get to it???? 😭😭😭
Funny Video..... Wow  this is nothing. You need to See how Big Georgia's roaches are. There Water Bugs is so big. I am so Scared of them. And they Fly also. :( So they can be crawling and all the sudden fly.
My landlady and her disgusting son, my roommate, refuse to deal with the roach problem. Best believe I'm cooking up a feast for these freeloaders!!!
My aunt has a hole in her face from one and was told they can get stuck in your hair and they fucking fly . nyc fucking water bug ahhhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!
Lol the beginning part is totally me 😂😂😂😂
Today I seen one fucking FLY from my ceiling!! since when did these monsters FLY!??
I hate these little ugly ass monsters, I've been seeing too many lately!! I'm going to kill every single one of these mother fuckers I'm going to WAR
I’m  literally afraid from walking is certain parts of my home , It’s in this point that it’s interpreting me to live I’m gonna try this method 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I have a huge problem with small ones.
So what if all l have is a Raid ant spray, will it still work?
Wtf 😅🤣🤣
is these harmful if  my cats eat accidentally ate it?
U making faces at the beginning kinda helped with the anxiety that I’m currently dealing with 😰😖😄
Or pause at 0:55
Use the thumbnail for your actual fb profile pic
Do we have to replenish the small chunks in the cabinets and crevices even when we don't see any cockroach for days? After applying this are dead cockroaches found scattered everywhere in the house?
U r funny! Thanks....just killed a Chi Town Roach today!
It works it works!!! I used this, plus, the diametraus powder seperatly sprinkled the D powder everywhere, put houses up, used roach paste plus the apts pest control and they all left and we're gone in three months! I was persistent. And now I just make this every three months like she said for maintenance
:o im trying this hope it works. I just placed some nice motels for them to go and dine :D
Thank you sweets!! Just sent this to the assholes next door that brought roaches to our duplex.. been here 4 years roach free, know this beeatch brought them and want solutions not hate... wish me luck!!!!
She does know that is toxic and she is used her dishes and no gloves, really! I do not think I want to open up my drawers and see cockroaches... she is a little to into it for real
I tried this with peanut butter didn't work. i will try this way and see. but i live in Houston in an apartment. so its hard to get rid of them when they have been living inside the walls way before ive been here.
On good this happened to me my friend lemme borrow there Xbox one took it home all happy getting ready to play some Mortal Kombat u feel me and the i get up turn the lights on there is four roaches running all over my floor I stomped them mf's till I heard the crunch cuz that's how u know they dead dead stg that Xbox one was infested respect the homie idk bout them roaches tho!
That's why I hate apartments...you can't choose who you live by...so this is a great idea to get rid of them.. Thanks
Hey maya like this if for no  other reason the faces you made when talking about roaches-yelp gag face love your reactions...🤪
Maya, for future reference,  best way to peel ur boiled eggs is,  set them in cold water for about 3-5 min, they peel much easier & you don't burn your fingers, lol
Did you just used your hand without gloves
Is it easy to remove the paste and how long can it be stored
My name is Rodney and I'm from Florida I bought a brand new RV trailer and I discovered  One of yours cockroaches And it freaked me out and I'm going to take your advice and try it out I'm going to send the cockroaches to death row👍✌
That looks good can you make me a  Egg sandwich please I have some bread
just start charging them rent then they all will leave lol
I have tried boric acid, ammonia, advion roach gel(most ridicolous), pest control sprayed apartment 2x, although I am keeping my place really, really clean roaches were coming back. Until I bought Tempo SC Ultra Bayern, you can't get wrong with this, I apply it with a fog maschine, but it didn't make that much fog, it was just spraying all around the kitchen, I think next time I will be just spraying manually. Give it 2 weeks, they will be gone, month and a half passed since I sprayed and no sign of them. I put pest monitor to track if they come back. Hope this helps!
How do you store it?
Mmhhhmmm my roach recipe is still crumbling and I’ve added hell of sugar do u need to add water
I have a question how much boric acid to eggs I have a 16 onz bottle of boric acid I'm from the bronx and they was doing construction in the building and now I have a whole bunch of them
if anybody needed pesticide follow this https://www.bestroachkiller.com/pet-friendly-cockroach-killer/
Lols just separate the egg yolk from the whites in a bowl and then put it in the microwave guys... that’s much easier. ♥️
Use gloves, ur touch deadly chemicals
Keep the disgusting foul mouth liberal witches off of the air
This stuff makes them come out like crazy... they’re everywhere😂 why?
uuuuhh maybe dont live in USA
scaring girl 😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅
I’ve lived in Texas for almost a year and tried laying this stuff around my apartment about a month or two ago.... the roaches haven’t went anywhere.
Suddenly stop by in your video while I’m desperately trying to eliminate them without having the same reaction like you.. 😆you’re the funniest cockroach killer chef.. and the food that u made, its mostly like human food than cockroaches..i will try ur recipe after sugar n baking soda.. i like boil egg , so to share it with them,, its like ..🥺... but i will, just try the 1st tip first..   Who watched this in 2019..
Summer of 2018. I had roaches in my updated apartment. They were fucking everywhere lol. I killed them by keeping my house COLD & made sure crumbs were gone. After that never seen those bitches again
Your not a true texan until you’ve woken up with a scratchy feeling on your thigh just to look under the covers and find out its a 4 inch cockroach
I'm from Canada
Folks. It's after 2 a.m. in  Brooklyn, woke up to use the bathroom and a hoard of roaches scurrying across my kitchen floor! And kitchen counter!  I live in an apartment and I'm tired of these roaches!!! I'm desperate so I legit got on YouTube for help lol
****** is annoyyyyyyyinggggghhhhhhh omg..
*FIBER*, anyone......
What a curly-haired CUTIE PIE!!! ONE whose not SCARED to pick up a roach. This is SOMETHING ELSE! What a random thought to think of how do SINGLE women HANDLE situations like these.? Or even ladies chained to the BALL, how do get ReLeasesd & NOT know how to HANDLE this on YOUr own!? All jokes aside, this was very helpful, ONLY until I see that this concoction works on "island" roaches. NEW YORK's one helluva place for excrement, oh I mean "EXCITEMENT": CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS, right!? YOU *SAW* that movie 'MIMIC'...
OMG! Look at ALL that NATURAL B-E-A-UTIFUL HAIR on that gorgeous woman!!!
For all of you who think roaches is from filth.... Fyi all modems from internet companies are used......boom surprise roach bomb...
Would the egg rotten after a few days
1.00 is when she was dead inside
I did this for my problem with roaches and it didn’t work it was a total waste of time
11 11
Open Philly but I know one thing for sure two things for certain you sexy as s***
Making second batch after three months to do fresh roach murdering powder
Update I did this and they are fucking gone!!!!!!! Thanks!!!! I love you!!!!
Lol
Lol
Lol
Swear to god Florida is the worst thing place on earth for them my SCHOOL has them
Spray roaches with pure hydrogen peroxide! Kills on contact better than Raid or any other pesticides!! Spray in sink, anywhere and it's safer than chemicals and works!!!
Thanks for the recipe. Will have to try it on the roaches in Japan next summer. Roaches in Japan are twice as big, and they FLY...... often directly at you. Other countries roaches are even worse.
doesn't the yolk mold?
I’m trying this, I live in NYC. I was just having a convo about these gangsta roaches.
Doesnt work at all!  :(
Get Roach doctor it works kills them completely.
Five minutes ago I heard scratching in my room on the walls. I turned on the light to see biggest fucking roach I have ever seen and now I’m here
Fairy crack.. haha.
I live in the uk and ew ew ew we can’t afford exterminators I hope this works I’m so depressed because I have a fear of roaches too
Lmao at below come t!!!! Haha me too! I’d rather have paranormal stuff up in here than those nasty disgusting ... just can’t say enough mean words to describe them. Like why god ... why did you make cockroaches!!’

I tried that didn't work,
Doesnt this dry up and harden the next or 2 days
Tried it and still see roaches what else do o dooooooo
Do I have to buy roaches and ant killer as u used or any kind of boric acid?
they eat those in china
I've never had roaches lived here three years .till new neighbors moved in next door four months ago. Now I'm seeing em.how do I stop them from comn from next door??
I just saw 2 cockroaches in my house and I am panicking. I don’t want to ever experience an infestation again after the horror of living in an infested apartment for years.
Roaches hate bay leaves.

Thanks i needed a laugh and you make ne feel less crazy because i react the same lol
Do you suppose to refrigerate this
shut the fuck up
I have cried so many times because I'm sick of my house. I can't even go into my kitchen without seeing one. I have to do the dishes and I swear I just want to curl up into a ball and die. Earlier I went to get a bowl out of the dishwasher and I saw three of them just crawl out and I ran. I saw one in my room a few weeks ago and the other day I saw a baby so now I don't even want to sleep. Last night I got up to use the restroom and I have no idea where it came from, but on suddenly appeared on my pants WHILE I WAS ON THE TOILET and I was like "F*** no!" and brushed it off. I saw it go behind the toilet. I'm 14 years old, I should not have to be dealing with this. I just want to cry every time I go downstairs.
I know cockroaches are so gross.  They make me to throw up so bad and I hate it. This is why I hate bugs so much there are so disgusting and creepy. 😷😷😷😷😷😱😱😱 . Bugs are ewwww.
hope  that will work
I found roaches in my couch no not one more then 35 plus and under the cushion and in my shoes sheets man that gross
Giiiirl, that was a baby(!) waterbug. Those get much bigger, like, MUCH bigger!
I keep on adding sugar but no matter what I do I can't get it to be a play dough consistency please help
I'm going to try this and if it works I'll come back and say thanks
oh hell not am not dealing with these little bastards.. here is something that is happening to me right now...The pc is right next at a drawer...and some minutes ago or something...i saw a fucking roach right infront of the drawer... i cant do anything about it..i swear to god am moving to the next country...i keep looking under my desk where my pc is...because my drawer is right next at teh drawer...For fuck sakes i think there are bugs under my drawer...FUUUUUUUUCKKK I NEED TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE I NEED TO LEAVE OPEN THE DOOR OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR RIGHT FUCKING NOW AAAAAAHHHH
ok guys so this looks like a great idea for sure, but u can also use the sticky pads. those work wonders, then u can fold it over and smash it, or just throw it away whatever suits you. but I am definitely going to try this. the only thing is I'm not so sure about the amount of sugar??? oh and do keep in mind...boric acid is just what it means (ACID) if u get it on your hands it will burn. I've just spread the acid and it works for the big water roaches as far the house roaches not so much, so I use the sticky pads.  TFS!!!
my reaction when people get disgusted by farts and shit but they still eat meat thinking it is good for them and that it's a hygienic product .0:52
You said they came back after a year when the formula wore off?
eres muy bonita!
Could this work for rats
What if im scared to go in my kitchen
I fucking Love you! I just moved into my new apartment.. Girl I went and got some juice about 4 am. There was fucking cockroachs Fucking on my wall girl I freaked out! Where do you get boric acid from? I got bugs fucking on my wall making baby's!! Yuck help Mya!!!! :(
I've heard that cockroaches can live under Furniture good luck sitting on the couch now
You need to eat some of that...
Man shut the fuck up you stupid ass. Clean your ghetto ass mouth up. You think you're funny but your not.
Will this work for ants too???
" eat, so you can die, a sweet slow death, that my chancleta doesnt offer" I love you gurrrlll
Who else laughed like hell when she said "I need chopsticks"?
The beginning is me when I see a tiny ant outside😂
Good job killing the roaches. They probably were coming over to see your gorgeous face lol 😍😍
These recipes don't work. Been there, done that. We had some milk cream that got spoiled. I mixed some boric acid and left it on the kitchen platform. Didn't bother for few weeks. My wife said, better we get rid of it from the site and the next day she saw cockroach casualties. Now, it is kept out of site but doing its work silently.
Joe's Apartment
Wellll....I am from chicago. Where we were raised, we had flying roches. FLYING. Well, one day, while eating ramen noodle soup, apparently when I stepped away, something happened within that time because when I was finished eating the noodles, well not all of it, I discovered a drowned roach. DEAD! 😳😳😷
You remind me of Lena from thr Fosters
You can do it much faster with Stodoys plans.
Dznt that content smell?
Just curious... Shouldn't you be using gloves, since you added the acid poisoning?
Look at how old this is
You should probably stay out of south Florida. Ever seen a palmetto bug? It’s a roach about as big as your thumb.   Also, there’s no such thing as a “New York roach” ( unless you count New Yorkers). We’d prefer that you stay up there.
This works on ants as well. I hate those teeny tiny ones that have no rhyme or reason.
Who would eat that without the boric acid for 10k???
Lol you are just like me when I see a roach I scream and act panic , others think I'm freak , but YES I HATE ROACHES AND GET PANICKED WHEN I SEE THEM EVEN DEAD!
I’m in Georgia. Basically, my apartment community is around a lot of trees/wooded areas. This is a great habitat for roaches. I am definitely trying this. We have an exterminator come all the time and I swear, they are feeding these bastards/roaches to stay employed. I cannot wait!!
BTW, I am totally trying this tonight.
I was at my friends house and she had very tiny amount of roaches and she had a coke sitting out and a roach some how got in there and she had it in her mouth😝😝and she spitted out ew.eww ew..😣
How long can the stuff be stored?
IT WORKS.  Thank you Shameless Maya for sharing your secret.
I tried this yesterday. Within a few hours I saw at least 4 small roaches making their way towards the area where I put the bait. I couldn’t help myself, I killed them before they got there.   I let it sit overnight, and this morning I didn’t see anything. I’ll leave it for a week and see what happens!
Guys. Don't try if you have pets.
Im going to try this, I'd had it with this roaches. They got in to my Nutella jar. now im pissed, nobody fucks with my Nutella. 🔫🔫
OMG!!  I died laughing when you got out the Chancleta!!!  🤣🤣☠️☠️🤣🤣  thank you for the advice
But wont it just make a mess and attract more
Your to pretty to be talking about roachs.
Shalom God bless everyone in Jesus name  Shalom God bless you  in Jesus name  LOL"  you don't pay rent"... ❤❤❤🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good info. Thank you for sharing. N u have beautiful bone structure. Keep sharing such videos.
What's more frightening, a giant roach or a female that freaks out when she sees a roach?
I know  most of yall think that you have a roach problem, but come to Texas where they FLY! THAT'S a problem buddy.
I think Im in love !! You made my day !! :D :D
That was so funny when she said you usually want to kill them, but you say..."no....you go right ahead darling". I also let them live when I can see the boric acid working in them because they start to act strange and not move as fast. I be like "come on you can do it, I know you got one more day in you to lick and be licked by the colony. You can carry one more load back". Lol. They are something else tho, and you have to joke with them to keep from going crazy. It's not easy
I'm from Texas and I'm going to try this
Those hellspawns are the main reason why I haven't even looked at Sugar Smacks or any brownish puffy cereal or breakfast ever again!! I swear they are hellspawns of Say-tone!!
3:25 looks like scrambled eggs with a lot of salt lel
We had roaches in our kitchen for a while that we thought were under control but then last night while I was lying in bed (in my freshly CLEANED room) and just saw a damn roach climbing up my bedroom wall. I almost died.
you Don't want to Invite them In you want to Keep them out!
https://youtu.be/ABIb1r-i0T4
around 2 :23 and she is already kookoo no afence
I am trying the egg potion to kill roaches.  Since it is made with eggs, where do I store it?
Man, all you guys with pets and babies are so having a huge slowdown to the process.  You won't be able to put them on all places and thats a major turnoff for the massacre you could do.  If u dont have kids, give ur pets to other people for 2 weeks and dont be afraid to put these balls everywhere. It's not that it wont act at all but still u want a fast and effective treatment and piutting balls everywhere around the house is the fastest method.
Hey great video question???? how long do i leave bait down when do I take it out cabinets and etc.
I've heard of this method....but diatomaceous earth and moth balls keep em away too...nothing likes moth malls
Her ass is hilarious!!!!!
She worked my nerve worst than roaches
My ex ordered Chinese takeout. When he got home, a live roach came out of the container.
worked for me. I usually found one to two cockroaches every day when returned home in kitchen. Boric acid was easy to find and cheap to buy (1.5euro) in pharmacy follow the recipe and let it work for 3 weeks. Since then havent seen any cockroach around only 4 dead laying upside down the first week :)  thank you  Πραγματικά δοκιμάστε το, δουλευει!!
Ok did this yesterday when do they die ???
I tried this about two years ago and it works.
i will try it to c if it works i almost got annoyed at the beginnig then i realize how fuckn fine u was so i kept watching,u like hollywood, disney channel,mtv host kinda fine lol
You're so stunning
@ 4:47 i died lmao
OMG!!!  Thank you!!!  We started having a problem in our Las Vegas apartment about a year and a half ago.  We had the apartment complex send in their "exterminator", and it TRIPLED the problem!!  I don't know what that idiot sprayed, but it seemed to attract two MORE species of roaches... I didn't know we had more than one in Las Vegas, to come and make a home in our walls and cabinets.  When I found this video, I was desperate to try anything that would just help, so about 3 weeks ago we tried it.  My husband made the bait and placed just a bouncy-ball size portion behind the fridgerator.  In two weeks we started to notice fewer, and in the last week, the numbers have just disappeared.  We still see a few babies here and there, and one or two larger ones are holding out, but, we have the upper hand.  We still need to place the bait in other areas we were seeing them, even though we haven't seen any in one of the bathrooms for DAYS!  Thank you... thank you... thank you sooooo much for sharing this.  I am finally willing to start cooking things in my kitchen I feel I can safely take to work and share!!
Yes feed them poison because the babies are blind and they eat the feces of the adults so they poison them as well.
6 legged demons. And when they have wings 🙅🏽🙅🏽🙅🏽
When i used to live in Puerto Rico I slept over my grandmas and my uncle who was 16 I was 13 we woke up at 2 a.m to drink coffee and I took a coffee cup that was really dark inside I pour the coffee in and cream when I drink out of it a big flying cockroach is stuck in my throat ... 😪😔 my worst experience ever
TRUE, TRUE, TRUE!!! I WAS AT SOMEONE'S HOUSE THAT HAD ROACHES AND NOTICED A GLASS WITH SOME ROOT BEER SODA IN THE VERY BOTTOM ONLY ABOUT AN INCH HIGH. IN THAT GLASS WAS ABOUT 20 DEAD ROACHES, EVERY AGE EVERY SIZE! THEN UNFORTUNATELY SHE HAD A COUPLE OF HITCHHIKERS THAT GOT INTO MY HOUSE AND I  FOUND THIS RECIPE : BUT, I spread the dough out on a paper towel or tray to dry in a GAS OVEN THAT'S TURNED OFF! Thoroughly crush into powder IN SEALABLE PLASTIC BAG and set it around the activity, NOT as little balls because they get rock hard. Sprinkle that powder in corners and everywhere you see any roach activity for them to feast upon! In DAYS you will see BELLY UP BUGS!! IF YOU HAVE ANY LEFTOVER "DOUGH" PUT IT IN A ZIPLOCK BAG AND STORE IN FRIDGE (Marked with a red X) UNTIL YOU NEED MORE. YOU CAN SPREAD SOME ON A PAPER TOWEL AND SET IT IN A GAS OVEN, turned OFF,  ON THE SHELF AND OVERNIGHT ITS READY TO GO!!! I ORDERED SOME VOTIVE CANDLE ALUMINUM CUPS AND SPRINKLED IT IN THERE IF YOU DON'T WANT THE GREASINESS OF THE YOLKS TO STAIN ANYTHING WOOD OR METAL... REALLY TRULY WORKS!! NO MATTER HOW BAD YOUR INFESTATION, THEY WILL BE GONE QUICK FAST AND IN A HURRY!!! DO THIS IN  E V E R Y     R O O M, THEN THOROUGHLY  THEN CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN EACH ROOM  because they are GROSS!! COOTIE BE GONE 🚽 in NO ⌛so you can >🛀. Reapply ASAP if necessary!!! THANKS FOR THE SANITY-SAVING RECIPE!!!
Your funny haha. I just started seeing some small roaches in my apartment, but I clean every week! Maybe they are coming from the apartment nextdoor. I scrub and clean with bleach and all that stuff. I want to get rid of these disgusting little pests!!
Will be trying this again. My good friend has the worst infestation I've ever seen.  Makes me itch all over. They are always out and her mama don't help at all smh. Leaving food out garbage​ everywhere dirty dishes. They're all over.
so how do i store this stuff? put it in the fridge？
I heard this music in a game called "Blood in Bacon" 😂
quite annoying
Thank You! And God Bless You!
I walked into my kitchen and this giant roach dead-ass was in the middle of opening my NEW bag of cheetos. Smh
This mixture gets hard after being out for a while so im trying to understand how the roaches will want to eat it. I put this out 2 weeks ago anf i still see roaches! Big ones at that! Did anyone else have this problem??
You look pretty
IM NOT FEEDING THESE FUCKERS EGGS ANYMORE!!!! ALL THEY DO IS PICK IT UP & HAUL IT BACK TO THE PLACE THEY CAME FROM!!!
Fantastic thanks for the recipe ! Loca  !
I am about to try this tomorrow asap...one question though is it safe to put it in cubbords where there is good that is sealed but still there thank you
such a unbearable airhead you are
My friend and his wife moved into a apartment and they got those 3" red sewer roaches coming in to play. Only thing is they can fly!
come on her over your drama get to the point.
what an annoying voice.
EWWWW OMG
Does this work the same with Borax? I wonder 🤔
was in the shower one time and a giant roach came crawling out of the drain. Needless to say I lost my shit lol. never wanted to use that shower again.
One night I was laying in bed watching a video on how to get rid of Roche's right..and a big mofo fell off the sealing and onto my face!!! I scattered. fuck the phone, that was left behind. Headphones were half intact to my ear but it was 2 for $11.99 on Amazon with prime shipping so fuck that as well, didn't care for it at the moment. Anyways I retreated from the kitchen which is where I left my balls when I went for a glass of water earlier..I came back with a broom. Killed the mofo! And is currently back in bed under new sheets finishing up this comment.
Sorry for the stupid question but what about the smell of the eggs? Won't these go bad and stink to high heaven?
I am going to try this tomorrow! I moved into my apartment two days ago and sadly, roaches are everywhere. I have bombed my apartment twice since and will do it again tomorrow but I will definitely try this! A friend of mine told me to mix boric acid, flour & garlic together, putting them in cracks and dark place but I have not seen results.
0:57 at first I thought that lady was about to throw up😂
lord I hate NY for this.
can you use this in a car?
living in florida succkksss! these suckers crawl in and just bug you! i dont have roaches in the house, they are outside. they come in every so often like "Oh! looks like ive found a new home!" i come at them with like 84 shoes and start throwing everything at them, they crawl out of the pile like "did anyone feel that breeze?"
I lived in Connecticut and thought nothing was worse then tiny spiders and occasional caterpillars but then I moved to Georgia and oh my gawd let me jus tell u the roaches here are big I haven't seen a roach all my life when I lived in Connecticut I literally cried for like an hour u cant blame me I am 12 I mean that's practically like still a baby right... no ok
Thanks I will be trying this
get to the damn topic of the video.. you think people click on this to be entertained? NO
roaches in hawaii are no joke. they fly at your face when you invade their territory lol
This video was made in 2012?! why have I waited so long.. I did the recipe today.. the last straw was when i saw roaches by my Xbox.. Those disgusting buggers..😤 I'll comment on how it goes and THANK YOU!!!!!! 😢
your cute
thank you so much we had roaches come out for no reason and have tried so many things we cant an extimenator so were gonna try this out
The beginning, This is me when I see bugs period.
thankyou sweet heart I like your personality as well and you look good.⚘
I react the same way!!! i dont care if it overreacting! I hate them so much!!!!! But I have a 9 month old now and have to be brave for him.....that way he can kill them for me when he is older 😝
try florida bugs
the actual tutorial starts 2:11
I'll try it. If I can find boric acid
That's not giant. Where I live they can reach 2 or more inches
if they were smart, they wouldn't entre my house
Oh I will be doing this on Friday! I keep bombing and I'm seeing more, even babies! It's embarrassing, my boyfriend and had to get rid of my tv Stan, it was infected with roaches!
ur act sucks
Im from Texas but yall dont know what roaches are until you have gone to Costa Rica 😂😂 thats when you want to burn the house down.
This worked great!
thats   MEAN!!!
I literally gag when I see bugs  ESPECIALLY roaches like I lose my mind I hate when people play around and say "it's a bug" like I just die a little. (not exaggerating)
Worst creAture on the damn planet 😤
Thanks this really helped me out. ugh! am so tired of seeing roaches and my in-laws brung some with them and made it a 100× worst then I had. Thanks for the advice.
Looks like it works. I have seen many mini roaches with their legs up. Plus I am cleaning the floor with boric acid water. Hope they are gone for good.
walks not walks.
when spring comes clean walks ceilings and all surfaces thoroughly just in case wash all stuff animals bedding and clothes curtains and anything at a laundry mat to safely was stuff animals gentle cycle luke warm low tumble dry or sun dry them if they are old antiques...or dry clean them.
You don't need all of that just house pool with friends for a winter play musical apartments. just leave personal belongs behind they lay eggs on cloths and surfaces...
lol
Really works thanks again
WAIT WAIT WAIT so are u saying that they come out in spring....WHELP TIME TO CLEAN OUR ROOM
I used to have roaches but then I used borax..never saw one ever sense
I just use freaking borax......XD or just keep ur room freaking clean like me......*cough cough* NOT ME *cough *cough
do u think that work on a car
Did you kill one, and they multiply, like seriously will it ever end !
Giving this a try !
stop being so dramic and show your y tube  fan how that is to much for me to listen to very boring at first
Do you have to change out the egg yolk mixture everyday? I imagine it'd get gross if not.
02:10 is when the instructions start..
Maya, when the roaches each the poison and die, do they leave behind corpses that you have to get rid of?
In the South, they're as big as mice and they fly. We call them palmetto bugs, but that's just polite for giant ass roaches. They come into our yards via landscaping mulch
She mixes the poison very liberally in her kitchen -- along with her other foods and untiticles. Poison placed so close to food is very scary and more scar. y
Bruh one time I lifted up the carpet in my dining room and there were at least five roaches in the one foot area that I lifted up and they all scattered. I've used Roach poison so many times and I just saw one the other day after a couple months of not seeing any. And guess how I spotted it... I felt the mother fucker crawling on my ankle! I'm white and I literally yelled, "Nigga," involuntarily as if I saw a ghost... needless to say I smashed that mother fucker real quick but what the fuck am I doing wrong? I do the dishes, take the trash out, clean, etc., and after years of Roach poison from the store every couple months, those mother fuckers are still here. My fucking skin feels like it's crawling
I HATE roaches mice rats and spiders!!! Lil' Sons of Bitches!!
your screaming is very annoying! I suggest you edit the intro also all the added work and stuff when the boric acid is enough on its own??
Anyone dealing with roaches,  try Advion Cockroach Gel Bait and follow the directions. Thank me later!!!!
lool you talking to the cockroach at the end was funny"eat up and die "
looks like she' making  something to eat!
where can we buy boric acid...thanks
omg that's how I be "why don't yawl leave us alone "!!!
didn't work😭
There are only a couple reasons you have roaches. Either they're coming from your water line, sewage or water leak. You live in an apartment and your neighbors are dirty, you accidentally introduced them by bringing something in your house or you are just plain dirty. So clean up your house, throw trash out , get rid of clutter, and don't leave dishes in the sink. Also don't leave food out.
Don't waste your time doing this it will not work. You waste more time and effort and money besides buying store bought products. I'm a pest control technician and all this would do is make your house smell like eggs and attract other pests like ants. I you want a professional to do it call your local pest control company. They could be less expensive than what you think.
our hot water heater burst a few weeks ago under the stairs and I started seeing roaches. I know how bad they can quickly get. I'm gonna mix some bacon grease with boric acid and see if it helps.
I've done this and it worked great. Also, instead of just placing the mixture as is around the house, I save plastic bottle caps and place the mixture in those. It's much easier that way.
Good video! Lol! Roach story- my bro-n-law went to a bathroom in a bar. Saw a roach crawling on the wall of the stall. He decides to pee on the nasty ass roach. So he does. The roach curled in one of his antenna, then straightened it, curled in the other antenna & straightened it. Then he said the roach looked at him & like a kamikaze flew in at him to attack! My bro n law said he stumbled back, naturally, piss going everywhere & he had to step on him. The end you bad ass mofo! Cracked me up!
I hope you threw the bowl and fork out
Atlanta has THE largest roaches I have EVER seen! I went to ATL for my best friend's birthday and as soon as we walked in the hotel room, there was a dead roach near the entrance. We thought that someone [perhaps a previous visitor or employee] was playing a prank because her birthday falls around Halloween. I didn't take any chances. Every time I travel [and just in general, because I am a neat freak] I do not use the drawers provided and I keep my luggage zipped.. nope.. not my friend or her friend [who also stayed with us that weekend].. they had clothes in the drawers, luggage bags open, shoes on the floor, make up on the bathroom counter and toiletries in the shower.. we left, ate, sight saw and partied.. went home drunk.. my best friend woke up in the middle of the night and all I heard in this low timid voice was, My best friend: "Ay, yo Kei.." Me: Hears voice, wakes up, but eyes still closedKei: *Knocked TF out*Best friend: in a shrill voice, KEI!Kei: *Wakes up* Huh?Best friend: Look!Me: *Jumps up*We all look at the wall and there is the BIGGEST roach I have EVER seen scurrying up the wallbut thenIT FLEW!We all start screaming FRANTICALLY! They packing sh*t up.. My sh*t is already packed lol so I'm headed for the door! Night gown, bonnet and crocs on.. no f*cks given.. I was OUT! Lol We went straight to management and requested a new room and slept in the rental car until one was provided *HA!*
there's one one her cheek!!! oh wait
I'm trying this today, my mixture came out a little mushy, but looks apealing.  Ill update in a few days. Thanks for this recipe!
i use a simple trick i use a damp mop in the bathroom on the floor leave the light on all the time and flat bottom bath tub scrubber with a long handle what i do when i got in the washroom i grab the scrubber first and then slowly lift the mop and hit them with the scrubber you may have to hit them a few times or you can drag the scrubber on the floor so they get stuck to the scrubber and knock in the toilet bowl if your wearing you can just step on them  if you see one slowly put the mop down before swatting them i usually get any wear from 3 to a dozen in one night depending how often check the washroom it usually goes down tor a while maybe they communicate with each other and say the mop is a dangerous place to hide out but they'll come back the mop has to have a certain dampness to it
I made some a year ago and it worked great. I'm starting to see them again and I believe it's because the weather is changing, so I'm making a new batch. Thanks a lot for making this video... I've tried a lot of things over the years and this was the fastest. Oh.. right now I'm in PA, in a row house and even though I didn't have roaches to start... whatever the neighbors have u will have soon enough..smdh.
After around 2 weeks the mixture gets hard and caked on the surfaces you put it. It ruins surfaces. It is extremely hard to get off. First I sprayed it with a chemical all surface cleaner to moisten and loosen it, then I had to use a hammer and chisel because it was still so hard and nearly impossible to get off.  I can't see the yellow stuff anymore, but if you run you finger over it, you can feel the extremely hard residue it leaves behind. Maybe orange cleaner will get the rest off. Don't put this stuff on surfaces that will tear. Will never use this again.
that is exactly how i react when i see one of these nasty things! ewwww
The Texas roaches Fly, they love water (dishwashers and under the sink) you can hear them crawl. Their huge. They just walk around like they pay the rent. They'll help them selves to the food. They'll even sleep in your bed and take a shower with you if they wanted too. Your house could be cleaned every single day, you'll still find them. They'll start wearing your clothes if they wanted too. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 These Texas bugs in general are on some sort of crack.😂😂😂😂
I've tried the insecticide chalk from Ebay that is used for cockroach, ants/termites and bugs! But my main purpose is to get rid of cockroaches in my house!  I'd say after couple of weeks using it, I do not see a single cockroach until today, ever.  I bought this so called insecticide chalk cockroach killer from Ebay (http://www.ebay.com/itm/10-x-Cockroach-Bait-Chalk-Roach-Killer-INSECTICIDE-Control-ants-bed-bugs-/291920964080?Item=291920964080). Genuine product. It works wonder! Beware of counterfeit though...
scorpions eat roaches
This video will help me when I go to Turkey
i'm from Atlanta.
11/26/16  do u know  u look like Brandi from love and hip pop...
I used this formula and omg!! the BEST THING EVER!!! THANK YOU! MY place was infested so bad with them when I moved in, I could actually smell the roach poo (gross!!), but once I tried this formula it killed them suckers after  about two full weeks. in that meantime, I started to see them dead, dead, dead!!! whoo hoo!!! Fixing to make up another batch for the fall. I've been roach free for over a yr so just now having to re-do this formula. Thanks again!!!
whats the point if there mommy daddy already laid eggs?
You got to give credit to these little guys they fucking survive nuclear wars
Use Fire ant powder, and distribute in the cracks of the house.  The product is safe, and does not affect animals or children.  It stinks like rotten cabbage though, but you get use to it.  It has to say 75 percent acephate on label for it to work.  Boric acid does not work at all.  I had in infestation from hell, then a soldier taught me the fire ant powder trick.  In about a month's time, all your roaches are gone.  They stay gone for about 3-4 years after application.  I may do a video on it.  You have to spend about 20 bucks for the materials.
Bull shit.  Boric acid does not work.
we have rats and the worst is them popping in my drawers so much laundry
instead of anteaters make fuckin roach eaters to get rid of these sons of bitches
im full african and they dont bite or hurt you there just ugly
man true story I swear I went to get a late night drink turned on the light roaches began to scatter....killed a few by my sink I actually seen him die, looked back another roach was dragging his ass like a marine off the battlefield!!! "no roach left behind"....
I have finally given up, I called a meeting with the roach leader "Rodney from the fridge" & we agreed that if they hide when I have company they will help me find loose change to help pitch in on the rent...........they are so helpful, like whenever I mispronounce a word they form themselves into the correct spelling on my wall, things are wonderful now.
Looks like it's great. Thanks!
cute black chick
One time I was making pomegranate tea and I stepped away from my cup for like two minutes came back drink some tea and behold next thing I was spitting out a roach that was not dead🤔🤕
GOD' cRe@tEd COCKRO@CHES & EVERYTHING eLsE iNcLuDiNg YOU !
the beginiing tho😂😂😂😂
brah  I'll just grab my chankla  then the battle begins 😎😎😎😎
(I like this method I have a neighbor that moved out so you know what that means ugh I hate roaches this looks like it may work thanks i'll let you know in a couple of months.
i jjust came home and they scatered of my counter top . one question , now when you place in in the spot  how often do you cchange it  , i know you said months , but its egg and will go bad . will it not ?
water bugs can breathe underwater and fly and some roaches can fly but most jump
If you're going to kill bugs or whatever creature... at least do it quickly next time please. Just imagine if it were you. It's so scared, all it wants to do is get away from you. Your so big in comparison .
Whatever state/s have the least or no roaches... I'm gonna move there!!  Sick of these damn things!!
Forget this remedy.. looks like ya gotta make a roach cake.. plus I got pets I want alive!!
I stepped on a cockroach in my bare feet! You are my new best friend for showing me this!
Just bought a rental property and it has a super infestation. Exterminator wanted over 6k to fumigate 😬I just mixed up some up of this so as renovations are going on they will have there time to eat. Only shitty part is all tool bags HAVE TO STAY OUTSIDE!!! I'm not taking those fuckers home. Thx for the vid.
Im from the bronx , and these roaches are everywhere and i tried like everything to kill them and i still have roaches so i did this so lets see🙌🏻😭
you do your lips so dam ugly.
I wanna try this out, our house is getting old and there's roaches EVERYWHERE. I woke up at about 5 last night to something ticklish inside my sweater by my neck. turns out it was a decent sized roach in there for some reason .
I don't like roaches. They always ruin the fun. There was this time there were a GIANT ASS roach in my bathroom, BIGGER THAN A GODDAMN KETCHUP PACKET!!! I killed it :) And then got about 7 cans of bug spray. And some roach repellent products. No roach is gonna fuck with me again. :D
Thank you girl! Will definitely try this cause i hate hate hate roaches as well! They makes me scream more than horror movies.. OMG.
In Florida, we call it a Palmetto.  They're large and have WINGS!  UGGGGHHHHH!!!  :-P  THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS !!  I will definitely be using it all over my garage as that's how they first get in the house.  http://www.orkin.com/cockroaches/difference-between-a-cockroach-and-a-palmetto-bug/
danm girl that Australian accent on point! xD
Well I am going to try that because the roaches that I have in my house are too smart they hide under the shit and watch you and to you leave or they had under the door cracked and watch you I had a  roach watch me as I get in the shower any thought I didn't see him but he didn't know when I was getting in the shower I was grabbing that roach spray for his ass lol and I got his ass
Well I am going to try that because the roaches that I have in my house are too smart they hide under the ship and watch you and to you leave or they had under the door cracked and watch you I had a  roach watch me as I get in the shower any thought I didn't see him but he didn't know when I was getting in the shower I was grabbing that roach spray for his ass lol and I got his ass
and is it normal for them to suddenly appear throughout the whole house after using the boric acid in the kitchen ? they were never really in my room at all until I used the poison.
I live in Utah and just moved into an apartment that's infested with roaches. they're everywhere. I started to really freak out after I saw some crawling on my tooth brush in the bathroom ewwww. :( I cried for two weeks straight after moving in cause I'm so scared of them. I just bought boric acid and I'm deciding to dust the entire kitchen floor with it every night cause they love to just crawl around the floor even though it's clean. hope it works !
u r boring :)
funny...i will try this because I've seen 4 in my apt where there weren't any before!!!
I am trying this today... I'll try to keep everyone posted on the progress.
Just wanted to add that I have watched your video many times and I love it every single time. Tried the boric acid, and it worked like a charm!!  Forever in your debt!! 😉😉
I live in Texas, we have tree roaches that are not only HUGE, (you know everything's bigger in Texas. Yay!) but these bastards FLY!  Went into my room one evening and there was one right above my bed!  Hollered for my son to kill it. That's been at least 3 weeks ago and I'm still freaking paranoid!! 😯😯
What animal eats roaches? We need to genetically modify something to eat them!!!
I think you should have started with plastic bowl and plastic  fork or spoon so your not poisoned
Is there something else I can use besides Boric Acid???
you funny and cute thanks for the tip because I have a big roach problem I don't know why because my house is clean they love my kitchen so I give it a try thanks again chula
yasssss. so funny
The only thing more disgusting than the Cockroaches is your mouth and language.
this girl is too funny!!
came here because then rosch fuckers got in my cerial in the morning while i was gonna eat in the morning then fuckers
Doesn't work, ive tried it and the substance turns hard!
hey  I just made some and placed it around the house. can't wait to see the results. my daughter doesn't eat the yolk so that was a + for me since I wasn't wasting any..
She's so cute lol
does it have to be egg?
y so much make up
Lmao... You funny as frig
lol screw this i will use 2 hotshot roach and bedbug bombs in each room 3 in living room that kills them
Hey Maya, so today my shipment came in and i am trying your method. Hope it works and thanks for the video!!!
This recipe does work! Living in old New York City apartment buildings brings along roaches no matter how clean you keep your apartment. After suffering with a roach infestation for upwards of two years, I made this recipe and the roaches were GONE! I put it in a couple of corners in the apartment, mainly in the kitchen where the roaches were mostly located. After a couple of months (2-3) of using the recipe, a few roaches begin to appear again. At this point make another batch and redo the process. It works exceptionally well, I promise!
so no one knows of it works ???? except for the YouTube chick?
I'm getting tired of these fuckers I already woke up to one crawling on me 😭😷
moved to a new apt in NYC and started seeing these a-holes recently. i made this just now, and to stop these guys from breeding in my apt. i dont think i have an infestation bc there is no one place they're coming from. crossing fingers.
My roach problem started about a week ago. There are a bunch of tiny ones, and there are huge ones crawling around in our drawers and walls and toilets. I'm so fucking done our whole house smells like Raid EEEEEEEK THERE ARE LIKE THREE ON MY DESK
ain't no getting rid of us
Love you Maya
This works for ants too
god your annoying, just get to the point
unfortunately im still seeing them so im just trying a simple sugar and boric acid mix.
These little shits decided to hop in my bookbag right before school. And let me just say that day was the most embarrassing day of my life. I'm definitely going to get rid of these bastards.
start at 2:07
a little late for this but I'm trying this and hopefully it works
I did something similar about 20years ago. I used a Nemo banana bread and blended it by hand with boric acid until it was like a play dough consistency. It was my own idea and it worked a charm. a few days later I opened the closet and the dough was gone and so were the roaches. These days I don't see any.. maybe 1 or 2 in the summer.. no water bugs though.
Hey go down to Florida and live with 2 inch flying cockroaches in your house... I slept in my sisters room because of it last night
gonna try it girly
Yes it did work for me. NO MORE ROACHES !  This is THE solution !
i like
Anyway to prevent them. I don't want to just kill the ones that are here but make others not want to come in.
too stupid to watch. can't get past 1:16
but does this stuff work?
Omg I need to try this! Im moving into my first home and I DO NOT want to bring these fuckers with me. Ive made it 27 years without roaches until I moved into this god forsaken apartment in queens. I am literally going to make this stuff today. Hopefully they will be gone by the time I move next month.
how long can you save the mix for and do you have to store it in fridge.
why do they even exist oh lawwrd help me 😖😖
in Thailand we got Superfly roaches,they never alone.When you see one more just pop out. I don't have eggs but, I use diatomaceous earth and sugar.mix it together then put it around the house.its like sharp glass when they eat it.Its good N.Y. roaches don't chase you.Stay Strong:-)
especially in admore
you cussed at your roots I plead the blood of Jesus and told him to get out in Jesus name this video is so hilarious you are so adorable thanks for the tip I'm going to try this..
hahahahahah oh my God I can't stop laughing I just found a pincher bug and Google this and couldn't stop laughing because that's how I feel right now I'm about to move out of these apartments.
in memphis just made a batch to try it out, tired of these roaches.
Wait I don't get it. First of all I DESPISE the smell of boiled eggs, like Ima bout to throw UP. But now I'm supposed to place the smelliest part of the boiled egg all over my home? I Don't know Maya, girl, I don't know I'm desperate and it looked like play-dough but I really can't stand the FUNK. OH my GOD I don't know what to do. I don't even eat eggs.
Welp I was getting ready to take a bath and guess what out of nowhere a magical roach comes out right as I step my foot in the bath and did what any bug scardy cat would do in this situation get someone but no one was here they all went to work so its just me my cat and this beautiful roach. I got get the fly swatter and I get to swattin so I'm in here for a good 10 minutes hitting the roach missing trying to get it out of the corners and then I finally hit it but since its was a water roach (I live in Mississippi there is nothing but water roaches in my area) it just flips on its back and as it squirms it slowly goes over into my bathtub I try to catch it but it was too late *bloop* in my bath and I already had bubbles I put some Epsom salt in there to help me relax like 3 cups ;-; and it all went to waste because of that roach I hate everything (btw it had a awesome time in there as it slowly drowned in beautiful smelling bath water)
you are beautiful,great tips too
I live in maryland and other apartments besides student housing and those super expensive places they all have roach, mice, bed bug etc.... It sucks, I hate it.
I'm assuming you've never been to the motherland.. Where cockroaches are as big as your hand
why do they exist. what good do they do. oh im am so trying this formula. every single one of them will drop and turn into alpaca shit.
Omg funniest thing ever! I hate roaches!! Ugh why do they exist
Come to Philadelphia they not big but they everywhere. Crawling in your Xbox 360 and TV and eating the cords fuck
Man that lil bitty roach was nothing compared to the sizes of roaches he have in Texas 😭😭😭 All roaches are disgusting. I'd rather have a ghost in my house than a roach!!
U Fucking Cockroach are Dead! 💀
Does this really work?
Yesterday i woke up to a big ass roach next to my foot
Omg you are a lifesaver I will definitely try this! I had them crawling out of my oven. I just moved to my apartment. And I can't stand to be in my kitchen.
can you keep the bowl and wash it
"Spring . . . that's when they like to thaw out & defrost." LoLoLoLoL I almost died laughing!!!  I can't.
Wait can I eat the egg whites? I feel like its a waste of food if you don't...
I just moved from NY to TX, it's like I can never escape these fuckers. I wish I could cut up super mini razorblades just so the death is that much more painful. DIE ROACHES DIE!
cant watch this stupidity
Ahh roaches
I am gonna use mint/peppermint, it smells good and roaches cannot stand it! Check out some DIYs on it...you can put together a mixture of water then put it in a spray bottle and spray away...or just use it full strength, it works on mice, rats and raccoons (for those that have their garbage cans outdoors)
I had a nightmare once. There were about more than fifty roaches  with various sizes, crawled out from the bathroom. I didn't notice until I saw a lot of them roaming around the house and more were coming out. I felt like in a horror movie scene. We spent 2 hours to spray the insect repellent as they were strong as hell.  I wonder if I could use this recipe but have no idea how to put the dough in the bathroom, as it's not a dry bathroom..btw, thanks for sharing, good one!
Has anyone else tried this and see successful results? Because my house is infested with those mini roaches!!!
Did the egg smell linger?
is there confirmation that this works? If so I'm going to try. For me, living in florida, we have problems with German Roaches or "The Dirtiest has anyone tried this method with the dirties?
you wasted 1 min 26 seconds freaking out about a cock roach, I don't care nor did I want to see that little stupid intro. I want to see how to get rid of the damn things, no interest in watching the rest of this
That's nothing in Israel u have flying ones😁
if this fails terminix works too roaches gone after just about a month
MMmm that was a nice recipe for egg yog yung it went down well, wait no, its poison for cockroaches//
Texas roaches are way worse then that
Texas! We had a baby living with us and he would always throw his food on the floor and his mom was so damn lazy to do anything about it. Now we have roaches EVERYWHERE! Ugh
Regular doctors visits help
THAT WAS ME HALF AN HOUR AGO WHERE IT CLIMBED UP THE WALLS AND UP THE CEILING AND IT FELL! IM WALKING TO MY BUS STOP AND I DONT KNOW WHERE IT IS NOW
Sexy
that was funny can you make a video of spiders next please
I tried this with the little light brown big egg hanging types no joy,they look like they are on steroids now  thank you for trying though I'm buying a mosquito net. Florida is beautiful but blood sucking mosquito and leaping roaches wtf
Roche's in Arizona are so nasty they his at you and the walk when you smash them with the chankla they hide really well. but the grossest thing of all is they reproduction like fly's they have so many nymphs every year. and they come out of the shower drain .....😷😷😷
I feel bad for the eggs
hell yeah i just started seeing roaches a few months ago. exterminator shows up every 3 weeks and hasnt done shit. thanks for this ill try.
I just can't stand the sight of them ugh
girl body parts ever where
thank god their rare here
You are too funny & cute. I liked your video. Had me laughing. I hope it works.  I have to watch it again . Eggs, sugar and roach killer formula with water rolled up I think Anyway, You are too funny. Thanks.
I remember the cockroaches in Miami were so big you could hear them walking on the ceramic tile floor <gag>.   You would hear the door slam, then the footsteps then "Honey, I'm home!" and  the walking on the tile floor.
I love this fucking video! Fucking hilarious! I'll definitely be trying this concoction here in TX! Thank You so much!
This video is so lame and retarded... And does she really need to swear throughout her disgust?
I don't understand this American aversion to Roaches.  Its over the top.
Another trick is to close all of your draining openings (sinks and tubs) when they are not in use.
Ur bad😉
A more effective way to get rid of cockroaches is to pour molten bitumen down their holes. I takes 2 people and a very small funnel. One person holds the cockroach and the other person inserts the funnel into the individual roach's hole and pours the molten bitumen. This method also works well for ants, mice, rats, possums and even neighbours or their children that annoy you.
This recipe really does work. After about 3-4 weeks the roaches were pretty much non existent. Thanks!
I am trying this out but I noticed the mixture gets very hard.  Do the roaches still eat?
I will definitely try this. Thanks for the idea.
What's Yolk got to do , got to do with it! Whats Yolk but a whip and an emulsion!. johnny
i love this video!. I live in the Bronx and have a "roommates"#roaches..those b@$tards. anyway my question is  does the mixture begin to smell because of the egg?
i have never seen this mix with egg yolk.   I have used boric acid before by itself.   you just heavily sprinkle boric acid in places where the roaches will walk through it and it kills them.  just NEVER put the boric acid in places where your children or pets can touch it or get into it.   so that means be careful with what you are doing.
Oh my god your beautiful! gross story ok in Oahu when they cut the sugar canes down the roaches find places to live so in the bathroom I killed a roach the size of a rat. They're also black and yellow in the HI so it's more easy to see them big bitches. sometimes you can find a roach filing with a mouse here Cheehoo. but thank you for the heads up you pretty thing you.
I have some hissing roaches as pets :( And they are kinda cute :3
I love you.
Really?  Drama Queen. You should live in southern Louisiana.
you is going overboard lol lol funny tho....
There was a huge roach in my room !!😷 I threw a textbook at it and it ran. When I looked there was a hold in the corner behind my door 😟 I don't have boric acid so I literally put bleach, salt, mopping solution, and an all purpose cleaner in a bottle and start spraying it I about to sleep on the couch 😖
omg your beautiful!!! she would be my ideal wife, goofy and smart, thanks for the video!!!
Here from Damon & Jo's channel. If you try this method, be sure to switch it up every six months or so, bc roaches are smart and will grow immune to one method on repeat.   In addition to Maya's borax method, ortho fire ant killer, and being tidy, the best thing that worked for me was:  SEAL UP AS MANY ENTRY POINTS AS POSSIBLE. Buy some caulk and use it around fixtures, like ceiling fans, smoke detectors or lights. Concentrate near pipes that carry water, like the kitchen and bathroom: under the sink and behind the toilet where the pipe goes into the wall. Check around windows and doors. If you have cracks in your walls, again use caulk or cover them up with (clear) tape, in corners of the room where the walls meet or behind furniture. Use outlet covers anywhere you don't have things plugged in (you can get them in the baby area of wal-mart or target), because they can come through those too. If you fear them on the bed, try not to have the bed flush to a wall and (this may sound silly) but wrap the feet of your bed with tape, sticky side out (it's catch the babies who try to climb).   It may sound extra, but I went from having an infestation when I first moved into my apartment to seeing almost none in over a year and a half. Hope this helps!
I worked for over a good year for me! Gonna do it again cause I'm starting to see babies!
Uhhhhhhh i have them all over my house so like ewwww
We had tons of roaches in our apartment and we tried so many other methods to get rid of them. We tried your method and I didn't see a roach in my apartment in an year now. Thanks a lot.
Maybe If you cleaned your fucking house you would not have cockroaches
One roach just flew onto my arm just now and ran away,I immediately looked up it get rid of roaches😭😭😷😷,I sounded just like her a few minutes ago lol,my house is a no r🚫ach zone😠,like weee😯
Will this stuff turn rock hard overnight? How long will it last? I've made made a boric acid/flour combination before which has worked the same as this one, however after I am done applying it the night prior, in the morning it is a hard consistency which no longer works of course for the roaches to eat.
There's only one way to get rid of the fuckers, BURN THE FUCKING HOUSE DOWN !!
Waterbugs! Looks like alx james is spreading
Wow thank you for helping us
i never had them but eww i think im gonna be really sick 😷😷😷😷😷😧😦
LMAO! In FL they make you swear someone just sneaked into your house!! They make noise like someone is trying to miraculously find loot! Those are easier to get rid of. My problem are these damn German roaches! The real cucarachasss! Oui! Ay! mi madre! I hate them! These bastards multiply ridiculously. Just when you think you got them under control an army shows up. Shivers just thinking about them! I've tried everything! Fumigating bombs don't work, boric acid and roach baits don't work, not even RAID! RAID man, that brand used to kill them within hours in NYC- literally. Now it doesn't even tickle them. OK, seriously if anyone has a solution for German roaches, PLEASE- P L E A S E  let me know! I've tried the recipe you have, but instead of egg yolks, the recipe I got said to use peanut butter. Yeah, right! They didn't even look at the bait!
roaches are crunchy😂😂
No reason for the bad language
This work !! Thank you thank you
I'm from North Carolina
omg I have roaches all over the place.  we are starting to get them in the bedrm again.  they are on my ceillings under and behind the frig. HELP!!!
u suck  get this shit off here you were not funny
skip to 2:00 -__-
language please!!!!
I was very angry with my apartment complex roach problem. They have them in all units and some people are just plain nasty too...anyway when I came across your video, I found myself laughing out loud! Thanks for making my night. I can't wait to try this!!
Boraxo and Cocoa 50/50% works better.
this girl is such a drama queen
this girl is such a drama queen
Lol she's so cute.. but yeah roaches sucks
I'm in Oklahoma.  The gross roaches here ,fly! Saw them on my car! You just can't seem to go anywhere without seeing them! Inside, outside,  everyone  has them. I use sprays several times a year to keep them out of the house, but it's a never-ending battle! Once I helped a neighbor move their belongings in their new house they bought across the street. They moved from Florida. They had brought a couple roaches from Florida inside the moving van. They were huge!  Big enough to saddle and ride!  OMG! I think it looked at me , and a had the creepy - crawlies for days after!
I nvr got to experience what it was like living with roaches. But when I'm by a friends house that has a roach infestation I would ussually not see any until late late at night. And its like a roach festival, I get paranoia and I imediatly come up with an excuse to leave like I got to take my dog out and its 4 am lol
It works. My mama did it in '97. We had little to no roaches and when we moved from the bronx to Manhattan, roach city. Roaches and rats. Ugh. I'm a New Yorker, but I hate the roaches and rats.
Damn you're cute
Chancleta! :)
What a Replusive woman! You scream in disgust while the poor creature lies in pain and suffering. Its looks gross and unappealing to you, yeah we get it, so instead of ending its suffering with one whack to the brain, you stand there mocking, while staring at the misery and helplessness of another living creature. Great! You were born a human, and it was born a roach, none of you had much choice there, so why watch someone in pain like that?! Just puts things in perspective.
Detroit roaches ain't no joke either.. smh
Look up giant water bugs they are not related to roaches at all. I just watched this for laughs but I do have a German cockroach problem that I'm dealing with by sealing off all cracks in the walls and any unnecessary cracks. Also all roaches are EXTREMELY adaptable (not all are invasive) and their offspring can eventually become immune to certain poisons (or learn to avoid foods that contain it) so if you do use this method make sure you do LOTS of it and do it fast so the next generation won't laugh in your face. Also, it looks like you had American cockroaches....and they fly( although usually choose not to) glad you got rid of them!
i have the solution and i got rid from cockroaches in one week in my flat
ur silly i like you , i will try this.
You hella pretty but Hay girl I'm from Los Angeles and I always see a roach is a walking down the street not only that we just bought a two-story house and every time at night I come out I see bugs not a lot maybe about three but I'm still scared of them so I will be trying this trick I really hope it works I have some bug spray but it's not rade and it doesn't seem to work on your water bags their shell is like their protector just like a turtle it would have to be flipped on its back in order for the spray to work but thanks girl
You're actually funny af!!
Who the fuck would dislike this 😂😂😂😂😂
Oh my god . I think it will really work. Thank you so much. My room is infested it makes me cry every day . I'm so scared. Every night I wake up I see like 5 sitting or chillin on my pillow or under my sheets and start screeming.so thank you for the video
Keep children and grown people away from roach infested areas. Please be advised that using any product to kill roaches will piss them off and since roaches have been known to gang bang wearing certain colored clothing could cause unnecessary holes in your body by way of roach gun violence. Just be careful.
Thanks beautiful I'm from Atlanta and these damn Atl roaches are driving me crazy I'm doing dis asap already have the acid you taught me how to use it properly
Oh my god my keyboard is finally working !!!,!!!!!
Oh my god man so much swearing
Boric acid is pretty safe for humans, unless you're using it instead of flour to make a loaf of bread you'll be fine lol.
a roach some how got in my cereal and when i was half way done eating it i saw a roach in the milk 😭 worst day EVER
I get roaches infrequent due to my apartment complex. Boric acid itself or combined with baking soda, flour, and sugar doesn't always work. Some times you have to change it up cause not all of them will go to the same bait all the time. Like field mice, they can get wise to things, especially if they see too many of their comrades expired! Like people, there are times when they go for different lures (guess based on seasons) of a sweeter mix ( i have done a bit of jelly with the boric acids or even roach jell), a savory one (peanut butter), salty (baking soda with the boric acid and sugar, althought it will become very solid in the shape of the little cups you put it in - think toxic sugar cube. Definitely no pets or little children). I sometimes also add a few drops of the commercial roach killers to the natural to add a bit more killer punch when there appears to be a heavier infestation.
doesn't boric acid become useless once it gets wet.
The thought of them still being inside and having a party in your home is disturbing to me, I rather not see them at all. Ever.
it works without sugar or eggs, I've used Boric acid
Potty mouth... I stopped watching.
Please don't waste your time with this idiot. That boric acid shit only works temporarily. She's an idiot.  Best cure? Move out of whatever nasty ass place you're living in and start a new life somewhere else. leave everything but your clothes behind
Who would have guessed that the cutest girl on the internet would be doing a roach killing video? God, I love youtube!!! :)
why did you change containers? wouldnt you just want to make it in the same containers you were going to store it in?
fucking hate to hear women screaming
you might want to stop smashing them you only adding to your problem they all have eggs and when you smash them the eggs they lay will hatch and make more roaches
Does this really work ?  I have a neighbor that has wood and junk in his back yard, and on the other side my neighbor gets them and she has a professional come out and the roaches get pissed off and comes to my house !
Hey I tried this exactly as she did it and it did not work for me :( I really want to get rid of them because I'm allergic to them and also I have a baby and I don't want those roaches crawling on her at night when they come out.
Had roaches inside cereal box I pour me some starting eat and notice roaches was swimming inside the bowl... Mmmm tasty roaches
Use Surrender Fire Ant Killer...they will be gone within a week...use it everyday...but you gotta evacuate area as soon as you put the powder down,it smells bad, leave for 6 hours...Real Estate agents use this to get rid of roaches permanently...just don't tell anyone you're using it because supposedly ur not suppose to use it inside the house? but IT WORKS THE BEST Roaches cannot get immune to Fire Ant Killer.
thats about a quater of the size of the cockraches i have in my house and its scary af
mine turned into a sugary mess...how to fix that?
how long did it take?
Okay you say the roaches are gone, but where do they go? Where did they go?
Arizona has palmetto bugs, they look like roaches on steroids!  Bigger than some mice and they will jump back at you!  I, ain't cooking them no eggs!
Why can't you use water with a bit of sugar to soften the mixture and make it into a dough like consistency?
i tried this and i was like 🙌🙌🙌.. it was a bomb and it really works.. though it may take 3-5 days to see the result but you can see how roaches died.. amazing! helpful tips!
dont worry i live with a lot of them
In Tx they Fat asf can be
you should definitely think about taking up an acting career coz I've watched this video like 5 times now... just saying..
very nice video!!!
yup yea thats exactly my reaction to these damned roaches!!!!!
so many ingredients if you add these up you it will probably cost a lot than buying a real bait for cockroach
overacting much ?
Have a roach with every meal..
holy shit I regret watching this crap 1.SHE CANT ACT 2. she boiled eggs then try to peel them while hot smart 3. she fucks up her own instructions. 4. STOP TRYING TO ACT YOU ARE NO GOOD AT IT SERIOUSLY.
that girl sucks at acting I mean WTF was that really dont quit ur day job
I'm going to try this and if it doesnt work then ill have to use the chancleta
does it work on other roaches ?
thanks Maya it really worked verygood
mrf2000 from blue diamond. it kill for a year one syringe is all you need
does it better what kind of sugar or roach killer ???
I baught the acid borico but its 99%
Well,try this  First well kill it with fire Then,well nuke that fucker up just to make sure
thanks Maya it really worked
I'm going to try this soon. Every night, it's a roach fest in the kitchen and all I could do is burn them with hot water. They're so fast, especially those large ones that sense you're coming and they JUMP off the stove or off the wall. Who knew they jumped....
Im from NY Brooklyn and i just did it i will be posting my results . Thank you sooooo much
she is so extra
Talk normal fuck
Has anyone tried doing this?
That has got to be the most painful death imaginable.  Try to imagine the worst heartburn you ever had.  Times about 100 million.  God there has to be another way.  Sigh.  Well, I'm dealing with a few myself (so far it's like only a few) so I'm reluctant to be the Roach Dr. Mengelee but eventually if it gets too out of hand I may not have a choice.
whatever that was some bs.
Def gonna try t his method.  I react like you when I see a r***h and maybe even worse!  My niece actually videoed me  trying to kill one and posted it on youtube.  I'm like why couldn't you help me kill it instead of filming and laughing at me!  I scream, cuss, throw things, BIG heavy things!  I've called my mom, husband, friends, neighbors, etc. to come kill them for me!  I have left my house and stayed gone until someone could come in and kill and remove one!  I can hear one crawl and know it's in the room long before I see it.  My husband is afraid I'll have a heart attack one day from seeing a r***h.  I have asthma and have actually had asthma attacks brought on by my fear of them!  I'm praying this method will work on my patio which is concrete which I believe is like a steroid t o them!!!!
Got home late yesterday and found 2 roaches inside my cup..
This works omg it works, down sizes the mix drys out after a week so you have to make more.  Do not buy the cheap boric buy the good stuff, just go to Home Depot and you will find it there.   It kills big roaches and small house roaches.   Fucken neighbor it was all their fault I'm so glad I killed them .  Thanks for sharing this recipe .
Bestway is to get some food loke mashed potatoes or scrambled eggs and mix it woth boric acid. Put it on bits of foil in cabinets behind fridge etc. They eat the tainted food and die ,but they take it to the nest
does the egg get spoil and stink up the house?
Did anyone try it and it successfully worked?
for how long till they die
Where can i buy this boric acid? without getting it online,I need it Asap?!?! Let me know. Thanks
lmao...i love this because this is apparently how i sound xD
You are Hilarious!!! Where are you from? I think la chancleta gave you away. Perhaps Dominican?
I lived a whole year with nasty ass roaches before we moved out. Cause our neighbors were nasty as fuck. Biggest pain in the ass ever. And they DONT GO AWAY...
okay I'm gonna need your phone number asap
I'm going to try it/ I hope it works. As a matter of fact I'm trying ever thing I see on these videos.
I need this my house is almost fulled with them!
Here in Texas. I use Ortho Orthene Fire Ant Killer.  Sprinkle some of that power in areas where u frequently see roaches and see them running to hide. 2 days after you won't see a roach. I promise
I try these. don't work
Thanks for the recipe, these roaches in my kitchen bout to have their last supper up in this bitch
omg, i have serious roach problems at my house!!!i found a rouch on my armOMG GROSS!!!😢😢😢😢😣😣😣😵😵😦😭😭😭😔
i tried this a week ago..and im seeing one or two dead here and there ...but im not sure if it is working. I did it the way you said..but mine was way more stickier . hard to get of my hand..wondering if i used too much sugar. smh
OMG the way she reacted in the beginning is totally me! lmaoo i can kill them F*ckers but can't for the love of God pick them up. Iḿ terrified!
I'm doing this today...I've been in my home almost 13 years and we had never before had roaches in our kitchen. I have 4 children my youngest being almost 3...I'm ready to  f*** up some roaches!! Love your video shameless!!
Why are they so big?
Just tried this I hope it works. Has anybody tried this? Let me know please
Tiny i got one in the pad i thought it was a mouse cuz it was huge then i got closer realized it was a bug
I run a “tight ship" (clean home), however, these greedy little pricks decided to move in, in great numbers. I made the roach biscuits last night. I'm already finding roaches laying around on their backs with “tummy aches“. This recipe works very well, if you have roaches, it's a no brainer, make this recipe.
looks like they died cos of diabetes :P. Just kiddin. Will definitely try this method. Cockroaches are at the top of my hate list
Ohmuhgod I am so glad I found this video. I was about to burn my entire apartment complex into the ground.
Thank you! Thank you! From Sacramento, CA.
Boric acid kills roaches! Used to be you just put it in corners and they would walk through it and carry it back to there nest where it would kill them and the eggs now the problem is getting them to eat it. Mixing with the eggs is a great idea!
I dont how this roach got in but it was in my sink i think it came out of it , but i filled up the sink with hot steamy water and watched it drown HAHAHAHAHAHA
i live in Cloverdale Ca. and our bug r much smaller then your i shared this on fb so all my friends know what to do
I live in Connecticut which is close to NYC and omg these roaches drives me nuts. My neighbors upstairs (I live in an apartment) are so freaking dirty(I've been in their alartment) and I see tons of roaches, as if they are their roommates. I get one here and there and I swear it's because of them and I'm a clean freak. I'm gonna try this and make extra for every apartment iny building (especially theirs) hopefully this works
Sprinkle in more fairy crack, aha you have me laughing so hard
Yep
OMG I moved to Texas and these sumo/flying roaches (water bugs my ass), I have never in my life seen these things before.   I have to try this we move  to a new place next week so I think I will do this before we bring our stuff.
I have the same problem.  No matter how clean the house is , they still show up. Ugh how do you get ride of fruit flies
Does brown sugar work too?
Plz tell me a paste like way is ok
I just need to know how to store the extra... in the fridge or room temperature? thanks.
Buy a cat
what is boric acid and where can you buy them? is it like borax but spell differently? Please!
I have those roaches too they are so gross i dont like them they're everywhere and on the bed sometimes even after killing them i don't want to go on my bed and y vuelan  too...im going to try this haha 😂😂😂 I ♡ how you flicked it with your chancla.
thanks so much for the tips and video. how often do i need to leave out the bait?
Just tried this today. Omg. Hoping it works 😖 . My apt is plagued by the small annoying ass roaches. SMFH!!!! Really really hope this kills em! Already saw them coming out to eat and party today. Fingers crossed !
Fairy crack.....
There only attracted to what you eat especially if you eat junk food and meats also take outs (especially) they don't touch vegetables or anything healthy
Had to be black
Im staying in a apartment for vakashion and roches come in my room i cant play my fucken games cause of them demonds
I HATE DOSE FUCKEN BUGS I WISH THAY WHERE EXSTINKED
I wish them all dead!!
I put some of the poison in small clear plastic containers with screw-on tops to be extra-sure my cats can't open them. I cut small rectangular holes in the sides with an exacto knife so roaches can get in. That way, I can also put poison in areas that I couldn't otherwise, because of the pets.
Once a big ass cockroach was flying and flew in my brothers face
Omfg thats disgusting
Use fantastic that be killing those roaches in one second dead foreal I don't know what it is in that stuff those roaches be having seizures when I spray that stuff on them.
Can I use anything aside from eggs as a bait? I feel like wasting food If I'm gonna use eggs.
fake
I hope threw all the stuff you used out, forks, spoons, bowls, I cringe to hell if I see one, I use this gel stuff hot shot brand, every six or so months, and since I Iive in apts, I swear I'm thinking when I get new neighbors the bug eggs people move with travel down to my apt is that possible ?
Thanks for the humor nice break from all the FUCKING COCKROACHES in my new apartment. First Night =roaches. Initial Reaction: First minute of this video to the T. Mattress on floor  (Waiting for bed-frame in mail). Pest company sprayed to no avail. Going to give this a go. -LA
cool thanks .............................. look good and easy way to get rid of them hope it helps
It works excellently.  Thank you.
you're sexy and seductive beginning at 1:45, did you planned that? i am very much impressed.
is there a replacement for the eggs?
I think we are just overreacting on it. First off, we are approximately a million times bigger than the cockroach. That cockroach is terrified of us !!!!! And we there screaming or running away from it ????!!! I know it is disgusting and it carries diseases but we should be only disgusted by it not scared.
That is the smallest cockroach I've ever seen..........DONT come to Hawaii for your sanity
The exact boric acid in the video by itself works.  I live in NYC and bought mine for $2 in Dollar Deals.  Works within 2-3 weeks, may need extra time and multiple applications for large number and infestations which have been around for a while.  Sprinkle around base-boards, in the bathroom, basement, in cracks, down drains, and in the kitchen away from food, pets, and children).  We did this at home and in my office and roaches are almost non-existent for months at a time.
I live in miami omg .......... I will try that tonight and let you guys know in 2 weeks if it work on them
NYC roaches jajaja .They are world wide!! Believe it! jaja
Texas Roaches are from the pits of hell I just moved here from Wisconsin and They are eeevvvveeerrryyyy where in my NEW apartment I won't move my stuff in this is supppeeerrrrrrr gross!!!
THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAD A INFESTATION AND BECAUSE OF YOU THERE GONE IM SO HAPPY THANK YOU SO MUCH
I love your video. I have recently noticed roaches in my apartment. I went out and bought some of that zap-a-roach also. It's going down! Eviction notice!
I am living with roaches and it is fucking terrifying all because of my dirty ass neighbours living in the apartment below me. When ever I leave a piece of meat out its like a fiesta for the roaches and it's just meat. They won't come out if it's a tortilla or bread but just meat... Is that normal?
I gotta try this! Those fuckers are driving me insane! In the video you use boric acid, do you think borax would work just as well? I know they're similar but not the same. I'd rather not have to invest anymore in these nasty little shits.
This stuff works!!  I've been using it for about 2 weeks and everyday, I'm seeing more and more bodies.
I freaking HATE those shits, they're so disgusting and creep me the fuck out!
Back in like 93 i seen a giant water bug in the PATH station at The World Trade Center, i left him alone . . .i figure he's living in a place i wished i lived at, so i let him be.
drama queen.
My roach story prepare to be freaked tf out.....   I "had" a friend who stayed in the projects and she had a lot of roaches so one day she decided to bomb her house while it was being bomb she stayed at her aunts house The next day she asked me to take her home so I took her home and while she was getting things out of the car she gave me the key to open the house door so I went to open the house door and as soon as I opened me thousands I mean thousands of roaches fail on the top of my head as strip down to my underwear I didn't care who saw it and she has the nerve to say I forgot the roaches stay at the top of the door when I bomb, bitch you didn't forget I haven't seen or talked to her since
AJ from Perth, WA here. My roach issue is that which lurks beneath the dishwasher. THE DISHWASHER DAMMIT. We haven't been using the dw for months as no repairman/exterminator is willing to fix it!!!!  Today I am going to take it out, expecting an army of small roaches to make a final attack... Will keep you posted...yikes!
Omg ! My apartment has roaches and I'm literally begging my mom to move out of this damn place because I am TERRIFIED of even going in my kitchen, washroom and even living room. Seriously thats how bad it is. I'm scared to even cook in my own kitchen these days I am so fed up like it just grosses me out. We have tried every remedy nothing seems to be working because they multiply like crazy. I am just so tired these roaches. It's very, very distressing.
overreacting to the roaches, i cant get rid of them so im used to killing them with my hands
talk about drama. good grief. cute.
Omg! I tried this after being skeptical because nothing ever works lol, but....now I don't want to jinx myself or nothing (knock on wood), I put the mixture in the crevices of my kitchens cabinets and drawers etc, even went the extra mile to leave some out on the counter lol, I did this at night, the first night I didn't notice anything different, but the next morning I saw a couple walking and twitching, the next 2 nights it was like a crazy roach party!!!! Omg they were everywhere!!!!! So gross, but after the third night, nothing, I saw a couple here and there, the next morning, I found a whole bunch of dead ones on the floor where I assume their nest was behind the cabinet, keeping my fingers crossed!!!! Definitely the best solution so far, going to see how it goes and hopefully I will be roach free, will keep you guys posted!
I really hope that this works. Just moved in an apt from Millington, the infestation is a nightmare! I'm so paranoid now and I'm already super skinny but I hate eating in my own home. PLEASE Lord let this work!!!
Joseph Edwards
I live in a apartment building Vancouver BC and my neighbor lives in his own filth or something and I started seeing roaches they did a poisonous spray in his house and when they did that a shit load of them living or dead was in the building residents hallway everywhere and I saw 20 big ones on his door like they were running away. I got that recipe today I'm going to try out your method.
Im from CA i'm most definitely making some!!
i am so done with all these creepy creature in my house i am definitely going to try this.
Doesnt the egg yolk STINK up the room?
great idea.  I hadnt seen this yet and ground up some cat food to mix into the bait, but used up all my boric acid.  thanks for the video!
Oh, girlfriend, you ain't never seen a roach until you been to Texas.  When I walk the dog at night during the summer they come up out of the drainage sewers on my street and if I am fast I can stomp 20 before I come home.  Makes me sick.  And the flying ones live in Live Oak trees and come out at night and the tree bark looks like it is moving because it is covered with them.  GAG.  ME.
I m make n It right now...eggs boiling... ill critique this truth or lies...
Great Video! Question. .after a while wouldn't the clay go bad and start smelling?  Or do you remove it?
Subbed because of this video. You funny girl. I gotta make me some "fairy Crack" for these roaches here in Hawaii. Aloha!
One evening i was laying on my red rug playing on the computer then i felt something crawling on my right leg it felt kind of like a hexbug but then i turn and see it and start screaming a shaking my leg (Which half killed it) then i took my roach spray and sprayed it to death after that i never layed on the floor again.
lol it really work I just come back 2 see how u make it again cause since I used it I haven had those big one but now its spring like she say and they back I haven had them in over a year so I saw one a few nights ago so come back 2 see how 2 do it again people it really works
A roach crawled on my arm the other night while I was in bed! I an FREAKING THE HELL OUT
Arrrggggghhh roaches, i need help people.
I live in Albuquerque New Mexico. and my boyfriend and i have found these little creepy crawly disgustoids crawling mostly in the kitchen and a few in bed room. gah! Worst thing to happen ur comfy sleeping hear it scratching somewhere and then bam u find it on ur bed crawling like it owns u! Ahh I hate these nasty demon spawn creepers with a passion oh they gross me out but once I see it ...oh gah... I turn terminated search and destroy! So gonna try this and I will comeback with update.

Omg she so sexy :)
Ugh! They so disgusting! I hate them with a passion and hate, hate, and triple hate mice. YUCCCKKKK!!!
i laughed so hard when you did those expressions! you so awesome!
Hey, does this really permanently get rid of roaches?
I've got a funny story I was with my gf at her cousins house and I ask her if I could get a drink of water and she said yes I went into the kitchen and opened the  cabinet and about 10 scout roaches jumped on me then a relly big roah stepped up and slammed the door shut and called me a bitcth
I live in Arizona there's not many here but when there is they are like civilizations the size of New York City
A roach went into my drink and i almost swallowed it. I taught the little bastard a lesson and spit it out squishing. No mercy.
Ok so... this was the first video I watched on your channel 2 years ago. My how time flies. Thank you for being you. xox ~Sy
Im gonna try it and when they eat it will they be dead there
I moved to Long Beach, CA and those little &^%$! are everywhere in my apartment! They've fallen on me when I open the cubberds in the kitchen. They've crawled on my hands and arms sometimes when I sweep the house. I'm just gonna skip the whole bathroom fiasco all together. I've woken up to them crawling on me on my bed at night. Those f*ckin roaches gotta go. I'm gonna try this and see if it'll work. OMG I hope it works.
Thanks Cutie. Miami Florida is where im from
Dam u fine girl!!
Wow you look like that girl from walking dead Sasha I think that's her name
Hi, i just tried this in my home and I have to say this WORKS!!! it takes a little time (it took about a week for me) and they will come out like crazy in the beginning( I almost thought this video helped attract more roaches to my home that's how many of them came out) but after about a week there was nothing all of the roaches were gone!!!! thank you so much for this video it saved my life!!
lol ur super funny ahaha thanks for the tip thoe :D
Omg! Now im paranoid!  :-( I cant stop looking around my room.
um I hope she doesn't eat off the fork or the bowl or that little container
I'm going to try this, hopefully this works with Chicago roaches...
god a hate roaches, and they used to freak me out as much as they do this girl, though nowadays i've gotten to the point where if i see a roach ill hunt that little bastard down and try to smash it (just not with my bare hands. this method is kind or risky for me because I have cats and i don't like taking chances with them eating this stuff too. I did accidentally find a way that kills roaches well too. it was cold so i made some hot chocolate spiked with Smirnoff Vodka (marshmallow flavored XD). i drank most of it and forgot about the rest on the kitchen table. next morning i go to collect the dishes and see a huge black roach floating in the rest of the spiked chocolate (EW!). i didn't prod it to see if it was dead, i just poured it down the garbage disposal. so apparently the roach either drowned or the alcohol killed it. i set up a cage outside one of those wire mesh one) with more spiked hot chocolate in a little dish inside and closed it (didn't want the neighborhood cats or mine getting into it, not sure how bad alcohol is for cats but better safe than sorry). omg tons of dead roaches inside that cage XP.
Stop swearing...
I am making it now
Love it.
Could not watch, language......really?  Your video I know, but really?  It isn't necessary.
That's me in the beginning but with all bugs I freak the fuck out
Omg! Thank you so much. My boyfriend and I live in FL so cockroaches are a all year deal here and I  just found out we have a cockroach issue, but not in our house in our cars!!! I am so devastated and feel so defeated because we've tried everything and they just keep coming back or not dying... whichever one...so glad I found your vid. Gonna try it out asap! Let you know if it works!
has anybody try this ?   did it work?
Damn she's gorgeous
Won't there be roach dead bodies everywhere?
Get a cat, he/she will solve your problem with roaches.
wow she is so sexy
I'm going to try this after Thanksgiving. I live in LA and my street is infested. Of course, I didn't know this when I moved in and I didn't have a roach problem until about six months of living here, when they started appearing. I thought maybe the building was just old but then, I was walking around outside at night and the FATTEST roaches would scurry past me on the sidewalk. I later found out that the it was the street when I parked next to a portion of the sidewalk that was raised and the whole underside of the stone was moving. Ideally, I'd just like to move but I can't afford it at the moment, so I'm praying this works.
I tried that.. only to wake up one night with a hole crowd protesting on my bed, they were tired of eggs and now they want steak and a pipe to smoke the poison... brazlian rouches...
I hope this works :(
I live in the ghetto in new york so there are plenty of roaches and it drives me nuts! I cant even leave a plate of food out for 5 fucking seconds before those fuckers come out. I will SO be trying this out
You have to drop f-bombs in a how-to-kill-roaches video?  Really?
So.... I'm sitting at the kitchen table eating dinner with my kids and I feel something on my leg I jump up run out of the kitchen and start kicking my leg around like a mad woman and my slipper flew off hitting my son smack dead in his face I live in NY by the way. Another time a water bug came into my bedroom and went under my daughters crib I moved the crime hoping to keep the water bug away when I turned on the light and saw his ass on the wall I ran out of the room forgetting about my baby... The fear is real I hate roaches I'm doing this today. Thanks for the recipe @shamelessmaya
I'll tell you how I got rid of roaches in about 2-3 weeks. Buy A few containers of Boric Acid, they're like $3 or less for a huge bottle. Lay it down EVERYWHERE around your house, floors, cracks, doors, pantries, under the oven, under the sink, under the dishwasher, EVERYWHERE. You should be stepping in it when you walk around your house when I say everywhere, so much so that you should feel uncomfortable. Those little bastards will have no choice but to walk in it. It will kill them all in weeks.
If you see one, there are millions you don't. Its impossible to kill them all. If one can create an environment where roaches can't be seen... that's good work. It helps to have neighbors that aren't as diligent. The roaches go where its easy and they don't smell predators. Cats eat roaches ,mice,  rats ( if they can) , spiders and their scent is also a deferent. Thank you for the potent recipe.
Thanks so much, going to try it I'll let you know!
Chancleta powah! D:<
the only thing to get rid of roaches is  Avert dry flowable cockroatc bait I got it ftom Amazon.com  it really works
I was at this chicks house and a friggen cockroach the size of a damned rat just about crawled up my damned leg and I freaked the hell out and slpped it off... when I did, its guts blew up all over my foot! Ewwwwww!!!!! I thought I was gonna hurl!
This nigga coulda told me he had bugs!.. that pisses me off!!!! This nigga got roaches crawlin on his ceiling! I never noticed he had them til I just moved in with him and they come out at night.. ive been spraying all natural eucalysptus oil on these m-freeckrs and its working GREAT!!!!
Pardon my language but SH/T ON A STICK MANNNN!
Wth!!!! Its time to go to war with these B-azz niggaz!
I hate cockroachs!!! I just moved in with a friend not knowing this nigga got roachs mannn!!! Im PISSED!!!! Mo-FRS are crawling all up in my gear mann!
Right now I am frustrated with dealing with these roaches. Yesterday I found one in my bedroom. Oh, my god. So scary!
Ugh! I live in Long Beach ca and just moved into an loft .  And I discovered that small ass roaches currently reside here! I'm a clean person, so no dirty dishes..no clutter..  Nothing!  And I still see these monsters and it drives me crazy!!! I have dark wood floors..  And one day I'm walking to my kitchen..  And CRUNCH! .. Yup.. CRUNCH!..  I freaking step on one of them with my bare foot!!  My landlord doesn't believe that there is a problem because the last tenant didn't mention anything... ..  Ummm...  He must have been blind!!!!  I'm going to try out your technique and hopefully NYC roaches and CA roaches are the same. ..  EWWWWWWWWWWW
Before i watch this video easy to answer this question. how is it to block Roaches from living with you! be a 100% clean keep less junk in you house, always clean after cocking and never leave a single dirty spoon laying on your kitchen counter as if your kitchen would be all wiped and cleaned perfectly, keep it clean everywhere in your house. Roaches obviously  come out only with dirty people and they think its a nature thing for it to happen they don't know that they are the reason
Suriname
Will the eggs make my home smell bad?
oh ! you are damn cute. forget the roaches.
I have no money for boric buuuuut I'm going to try and find a method similar that doesnt call for that. I am a single mom and often get overwhelmed between my toddler and let the house go. I cleaned the WHOLE house with my friend, a few more things need to be done but the laundry and clutter was the hugest problem. Also dishes.ANYWAYS, As I was getting clothes together for tomorrow, one of those fuckers crawled up my gotdamn wall!! I live in a trailer so these things happen but I've seen one EVER (prior to tonight) and I've lived in this trailer for a  year, going on two in April. I'm embarassed to tell anyone but my close friend. Sure as hell dont want to tell my bf but I'm freaked tf out! They got all them legs and just ewww. I wanna run down the street screaming tbh!! I'm failing as a parent. TF is this shit in my house!! DDDDDD;<
I actually don't have roaches but I just like watching you talk....lol will you marry me?
I'm going to make this poison now. FYI - for those of you that are like me and don't like getting near them. Buy a quart sized spray bottle, add water until you get 3" or so from the top, add 2oz of original dawn dish detergent, mix and spray those suckers. It's great. I can shoot one on the ceiling (waterbug, roach, fly, spider) and it will fall to the ground and die in about 15 seconds. I use the bottle from the laundry section because it shoots about 5 feet. I tried a windex bottle but it only mists so you have to get much closer. Hope this helps until them all die for good.
You public yourself  through all that? ,Just pay a little more and get a box of combat
I'm gonna try this. Also, you are a extremely beautiful SISTER!!!!!!!!!! I'm in LOVE. You have a nice personality!!!!!!!
SO ANNOYING (had to mute the beginning). What you came here for starts at 02:10
HOW...TO...GET...AWAY...WITH MURDER (OF ROACHES!!!)  I can't wait to try this.   Death to bugs.
I live in a studio apartment so there is no escape!  at first i think i was seeing roach lavae, little wriggly things. Then roaches, Normally i see one every few wks, I've only ever seen 2-3 small ones at a time tops but thats 2-3 too many. Im normally humane and understand its not good to kill them because they all carry eggs inside them, so i get them on a piece of card and chuck them outside.  fyi: I'm trying not to throw up as i type....because now they have turned me into a murderer. I just killed one with a crawling insect spray - it stinks! it worked but I'm gagging. but i need a method that won't kill me too.  *Im gonna try your method* Let the muthafucka's come out and nyam every last drop.... because this rancidity needs to end. I need to move!  i hate insects, this has scarred me a tad.
sounds good. I will try it. Thanks for sharing
Not gonna lie I just killed one of these monsters with the force of bleach and my boot, whenever I open a window they feel the urge to kick it in my house. No more open windows
There is a bad smell in my room and I checked everywhere and at the cirner of the wall has a pile of eggs and nest those f***ers will die there so gross and I wana know where they come from now I cant sleep
Just made some up and have put it every were so now I'm just going to sit back and wait !
LOL I would totally react the same way. I went to Ny and stayed in a hotel that has Bed bugs and they bit me! It was so painful and gross, so I'm so grossed out by all those infesting bugs. I know it's not roaches, but that's my story :)
I saw a roach i almost burned my house down  i threw a book on top of it and jumped on the book and when i moved it ,it was still alive and i smashed it
Wow. Thanks for sharing.
its bad when u go to take a drink and a roach is right there on your water bottle never got in my mouth thank god but it it was gross it tickled my nose and yea yuck no shower could wash it off
Unfortunately roaches are nasty sewer dwellers. They come in through the drain pipes and out the bathroom and kitchen sinks, electrical outlets and a/c vents in to the house. It doesn't matter how clean one is they just keep reproducing like fucking crazy. One bitch with an egg sack is all it takes to spawn a nation of the little shits. For one roach that one kills like ten motherfuckers take it's place. They're also murder on electronics. Even if one was to bomb the shit out of the pad the only thing achieved is killing off whatever roach happened to be out and about but not the ones inside of the walls and in the drainage system so rest assured they will keep coming back.  My advice is, buy sink, tub and electrical plugs, caulk the shit out of every corner in the pantry, kitchen and bathroom cabinets as well as around the water pipes in both the kitchen and bathroom to seal them out then go nuts and poison the shit out of whatever is still alive in the house. Hey, it's worth a try.
I clean my house incessantly and have roaches,the  neighbors r slobs n just noticed small armies of babies by the appliances,gonna give this a try since the traps dont do anything,,maybe since you are so attractive they want to come out and get a good glance at you b4 death hehe
The roaches climbed up my leg!!!!
Will the egg smell after a few days? I wanna try this but i dont want my house smelling like rotten egg lol
#pookie
Ok gonna try this got everything just need gloves
Don't buy or believe this piece of shit. I DoD it and did not work at all. Bullshit ass thing
Fucking roach in my cereal this morning. Almost ate that bitch. God they get me so maad!!
we all need this video
I'm from Spanish Harlem Shameless Maya
Moved in to this place and its very nice but omg its like summer hit and big ass water bugs just started coming out of nowhere even my neighbors got them. Im so going to try this thanks for the video....wish me luck:)
I live in Florida and we have over sized FLYING roaches, which sometimes is a mutant roach.
How long dose it take for them do all be gone and dead.
SHIIIIIIIIT..THESE FLORIDA ROACHES WOULD EAT THAT, LET OUT A FART AND KEEP IT MOVIN!!!
Omg, I just came across your video, and you are so funny girl. hahaha  I am from NYC, Manhattan.  I am going to try this, because I didn't bring them here. Why are they all over the place?  I don't want to kill them, but I tried cleaning, and they come back out.  I am going to try this tomorrow. Thank You so much.  Mwah...<3
OMG roaches creep me the fu** out. I haven't seen any in years (I'm a clean freak) but I'm glad I saw this video just in case I come in contact with those nasty bugs from hell. You think this would work on ant? You are so funny. Was that a real roach that you flicked off the counter with your sandal?
Your beautiful.
Sry fridge
Le me walking into kitchen feels something on my toe then screams and runs into feidger
No, no, you eat lol
Thanks:) I will try this Today and I will let You know how it works!!!!  Stay Blessed:)
Dam baby girl your beautiful
what a cook  hahh
cricket, hahhhh
I'd like to try this, but I've got friendly house lizards skittering about and I don't want them to get killed as well. Would this paste harm them, too?
What a demo . Thx .
This better work or else I'll hate myself for wasting that much eggs and sugar.
10 minutes ago a medium sized roach was crawling all over my desk and got into my snack D:< I was freaking out and tried to find the roach spray. Sadly, I couldn't find the spray so I just got alcohol and drenched that motherfucker with it.
I watched this video after battling a huge water bug in my bedroom  in my apartment yesterday. I live in GA and I have a few german roaches In my kitchen once or twice a week too so I know I have a problem!  So last night before I went to bed I went out and bought the ingredients for this bait.  I made a batch a put the bait all around my kitchen,  under my sinks in both the kitchen and bathroom.  I put one behind the refrigerator and a few in my daughter's bedroom and my bedroom.  I can't be too careful!  I thought I would wait a week or so and comment on if it worked.  But this morning I woke up a saw a huge waterbug on his back dying right near the bait that I put on my pantry floor! ! I couldn't believe it! I never expected it to work this fast! I didn't see any of the little German roaches at all today either.  I don't want to speak to soon so I'm giving it another two weeks to see if this really will keep them away.  I will be sure to comment again in 2 weeks to let you all know!  So far so good tho so I want to send a huge Thank you to Maya for giving me hope! !! Talk to yal soon!
Im trying this, just moved into this apartment and theres a problem here "/ Its Soooo Gross "/ i am so paranoid i dont even wanna cook and i clean and clean. i still spot them... yesterday there was one on the ceiling and it fell on my couch, im sooo afraid of them i just dont wanna sit on my couch anymore.....they are disgusting creatures and i want them Gonr forever!!!!!
Lol are you Puerto Rican or Dominican? Chancleta! xD
Would this work for mice???
She s a little cute but she aint hot.
I have no doubt that it'll kill the little buggers, but won't the sugar attract more???
I walked in the kitchen and there was 15 baby roaches scattering across the counter O_O.
Damn she's fine as hell like kerry Washington
Nope, Doesn't Work !
Would this work on the smaller one's? We have those in Cali everywhere
I live in TX and we have nasty ass roaches in my apt. I sprinkled boric acid everywhere, and it was slow but some still remain eewwwww
I'm susy from cot CA I'm trying this . Raid not the best they keep coming
Omg my cousin home has those baby ones ewwww we live in Canada
I was lying on my bed use my phone and in the coner of my eyes i saw antennas then i flipped out of bed a then turned the light and that piece of $h!t was huge so i ran. I was so pissed of i swore to kill that pacific roach with my own right shoes but first i want to make it suffer from food poisoning then let it see my face and then end its b!t€h a$$ life
A person that doesn't pay their rent gets evicted. The state is on the side of the renters & never the tenants. Those that defy the responsibility of paying rent, do so with the guidance of an attorney when a case is in progress. This acts as a cushion or protection. Also, quite often, the attorney will have the client put the rent into a form of a trust account, so the defendant can't claim the renter was delinquent in paying the rent that was due, to help his own image. If an outcome via trial results favorably on the side of the tenants, then it's likely they wouldn't have to pay the rent that was halted, and a determined settlement should be made for damages. You can't take the law into you own hands & not pay bills that are due, simply because you feel you are unjustly dealt with.
thanks honey i have the same problem i will take your advice from toronto canada u got that latino sound lol
I will need this information for when I move out and get my own place.  I have a feeling that a lot of places will have roaches unless they're very expensive :(
omg! i was doing laundry in my laundry room and i swear i saw a roach, its right next to my apartment and im terrified of them. i live in the suburbs i have a 2 br 700 a month. beautiful area. but i was always taught if you see more there everywhere. so im going to do this today and put it in my laundry room and my apartment to see if they come out. ive never see one but shit who knows. id be terrified if there in there and i dont know.
Aka how to make play dough XD
I love in san francisco and i saw one today (for the first time) and it got into my dads coffee....😐😯
I will try this recipe. I never saw as many roaches while living in NY, as I've seen in the apt complex owned by the worst slum lord in L.A. I've tried everything & the boric acid had minor effect in the past at this building which has millions of roaches embedded within all the walls. The roaches don't simply have a party at night, they have a combination orgy & smorgasbord (same thing). The slumlord refuses to tent the infested buildings he owns, so once a year he sends some guy with a magic treatment spray to go into a few apts & make believe he's exterminating the buildings' roach population. The laughter of the tiny roaches when he arrives is deafening. They spraying of a few isolated spots doesn't diminish the roach population at all. I only hope there's enough of the leftover batter for me to use to make a nice pie crust to bake a tasty blackberry-roach pie to send the Slumlord building owner, and maybe even the city council members he has paid off. Thanks!
Someone I know ate a Roach
How long does it take to work ? I did this yesterday and put it all over my house .
You should do you're video about how to get rid of roaches in Spanish js
Hawaii.... Loads of Roaches!!
nothing worse than opening a drawer and seeing these cocksuckers scatter all over the place...or when you pour cereal in a bowl along with some roaches...  god,i fuckin' hate em...
just curious but wouldnt putting down boric acid alone do the trick too ? also give the trick for getting ny mice out as well lol
lol with the chancleta. Gracias por la receta. Its helpful and less messy :)
Borax?! You mean the stuff that kills leviathans, that means roaches are leviathans get Sam and dean pronto
I killed a huge roach this morning! I'm still scared.
Carson city nevada--in the desert--I swear they are indistructable here--lived in the same apartment for seven years-never had a problem until some nasty neighbors moved in a few weeks ago :(
Does anyone else HATE ROACHES as much as I do? And does anyone else love listening to Maya curse in this video? "I don't swear but I will swear when it comes to a roach!!!"
thanks it really works i did this a year ago and didn't see not one of them but know they are back..so i'm making more..
Thanks for sharing this. you are pretty :D
Willie has a lot of roaches but he just burns them
I live in Atlanta and it's just do nasty having roaches in my home. I usually vacuum them up and let them die in the vacuum, it's a routine thing especially at night. I'm going to try this out, I hope it works for me.
Thanks for the info.  Hopefully the Lord delivers you from such a foul mouth.
anybody try this?
that boric acid?
i fuckinnnnnnnnnnnnnng hate roaches once i was taking a ,,,,,, and one atacked me had to run awya form the bathroom and left the water spraying so hard into the mirror in front of the toilet, and ran outside undresed he had his big ass wings and flying to my face was a shitty experience
I AM GONNA TRY THIS SHIT! THANK YOU SO MUCH! But like dang its gonna be so scary when i see dead cockroaches all over the damn place in my kitchen. Like i literally break down and cry seeing just one alive/dead cockroach they are just so damn scary and ugly.
Yes, hello, here is my story:  We had a roach infestation last summer that was so bad every time you opened a cupboard like seven would run to the back of it to hide. I got very little sleep every night because I could here all the roaches crawling around under my bed, and one night I heard one fly right over my face. I sat up to turn on my light and a cockroach landed right on my eyebrow. I am not having that *wonderful* experience again this summer---no no no no no no no.
Your a good video host, I've tried the sugar and baking soda method but I think my mix was wrong( they won't eat it). Will try your way, thanks again! KB Queens
Too funny !!! Chanqletas and all!
Gosh darn it, I got borax.
Moved into a house and discovered roaches galore. Had house sprayed by pros twice but that barely slowed them down. Tried this method and it  works! Do they die or go away, I don't know - they just disappeared in about 2 wks.
one time I had one crawl into my ear while I was sleeping and had to go to the hospital to get it removed. I hate them
im alana and im a girl, i live i georgia. and i woke up one day to go to the bathroom. and when i took off my panties. a dead cockroach was in my panties. like wtf nah im out like nooooooooo /.\ and its leg fell off
Thank you sooooo much!! My boyfriend just moved in and his old roommate didn't keep a clean house. Well needless to say when he moved is stuff in roaches tagged along!!! I've never had a roach
you are hilarious!
I pulled my fridge out and there were tons it was gross still is I can't get rid of them I live in California will this still work
thank you shamless maya
lol :D i bought something like this yellow stuff before here in Egypt... they eat it and became more stronger
Watch Yonkers :) your welcome
I am from England and I got like 100 roaches that come out from my neighbors cracked wall
We got reaches 1/4 inch bigger than a cars lug nut on its rims basacly bout as big as your hand
Animated and informational!
Here in The Netherlands they dont grow that big. Woow maybe because its so cold here haha
I made the poison and then I put some down in the crack in the corner and on the computer desk they love wood, the desk is wooden so they are attracted to wood and water, so they are bad in the kichen wooden cabinets and may be coming from next door as well. Thanks Maya, I just wanted to know if we can store it in the fridge? My son is Autistic and wouldn't want hm to eat it, but put a X on the container. it is made with eggs.
I love you
DOMINICANA ? dios bendito me enamore ;(
You are so funny. I actually had fun watching your video. I will do this recipe now. When tou said chancleta made me laugh
This really works thank you so much I tired it last yr n will I haven't had any since then!! :)
whach your langueg
She is fucking stupid and a Dumass !!! It's great to c a another fucking person trying to make a living of YouTube feat a fucking life !!!!!!!
"MY CHANCLETA!" XD
Didn't do the whole egg and Sugar thing as my apartment is small. I just put this boric acid in every place I could think of. A day later tons of dead roaches and other bugs and now their gone. Borice acid for the win!
Going to try this right now. It kills any roach right too
Where can you buy boric acid?
I live in Brooklyn New York, started seeing water bugs in my bathroom and kitchen,  last night one flew yes FLEW right next to me. That sucker was huge with wings. Anyway definitely going to try this. At this point I'm super itchy and keep jumping at anything that touches me. Thanks
You don't necessarily have to use the eggs. Just mix 3 parts Boric acid and 1 part sugar and it's just as effective without making your home smell like eggs. Also to stop them from coming from your neighbors which was my problem, make a complete barrier with coffee grounds!
LMAO Once i was visiting a friends flat in a high rise and she offered me a cup of tea, it took so long to cool down, then went cold. i  ended up  pouring it out then i heard "Ting" a fat roach hit the sink, horrified is putting it mildly. that was the first and last time i ever saw one, can't bring my self to go back to that friends house ever... hope it works for all you guys. love from London xxx
I just want to comment on your video because I used to live in Georgia and I got SUPER scared because I had never seen a water bug before. And half of them fly! Girl your vid cracked me up and it's after 2 am. I wish I had seen this a long time ago!! You're beautiful and funny. Much love from your sister city Los Angeles!
THANK YOU SOO MUCH OMG We've alwayssss had TONS OF WATERBUGS and now I have regular cockroaches and SPIDERS along with them and I can't live a single day without killing 1 or 2 of each. THIS WILL HELPPP BENGAL also helps a LOT ufhfiuhgiuhgd but they stopped selling it in stores so I'm going to have to buy it online now I cannot deal it's like an itch having to live with them
When my siblings I were young. My older brother couldn't hear for days. So my mom took him to the Dr. and he had a large roach in his ear! The scary thing about it was the roach was still alive and covered in his ear wax! Needless to say we would all fall asleep with ear plugs in until we got rid of the problem. :(
Lol
Is she Dominican
She's hot.
PANCAKES ANYONE
Lol you think that's bad, you should see the ones in Hawai'i....honly fuck they fly and you can hear thier wings flapping!!! Kakaroaches what we callem!
I live in Tampa, FL and the roaches are ridiculous out here!!! So... I just whipped up your remedy and pretty much pasted my whole apartment in this stuff. My son was like "wow mom! you did everywhere"... I hope this works. I will post again to let you know if there's any progress. Thanks by the way.
Does'nt the egg start to stink the house out ???
why waste eggs just add sugar and water to the acid = done !
What about stink bugs, their all over Pennsylvania
I'm just sorry that she didn't use plastic spoon and container. Hope she threw away that fork and bowl.

should you be touching that?
omg so one time I was changing my 6 month old son on the ground of our apartment (this is a low income roach infested apartment in new orleans mind you) and as I was cleaning him off a damn roach crawled from beneath the living room tv, across the ground, up on top of my sons head and ONTO HIS MOUTH AND LIPS I tried not to panic and turned him onto his stomach and the roach fell off and scurried away. I couldnt touch my baby for like a week after that
lol, officially subbed after this.
fairy crack hahahah
AFter you did the formula did you see lots of dead ones all over?  I did this formula 2 days ago and i keep seeing dead roaches all over my floor.  Which is gross too but their dead.
got cokroaches in my ps4 :(
You're awesome
LMAO!!!
Does this stuff start to get hard after a few days? Or did I do it wrong?
Do the eggs start to stink over time? I'm curious before I try it.. I'm buying a house in California but we found out there's an infestation.. Were going to bomb it first then I want to try this for maintaining.
I aint wasting my groceries on roaches
omg, so last summer I went out to eat & left my bedroom window open (don't really remember why haha) & i came home that night, & closed my window. I was in my bed watching something on my phone, & at the time I had an all black comforter. In the corner of my eye i saw something brown on my chest, but I just thought it was a piece of my hair. OOOOH WAS I WRONG!! I went down to take it off my blanket & it was a HUGE roach looking right at me on my chest! Didn't sleep in my room for a good month!
Pretty
OMG i just can't stop laughing, and thanks for post this video:) Because I'm so fucking scared and hate them
Now do I have to clean up the bodies or do they just go away?
Lls sprinkle more fairy crack...
Live in an apartment in Honolulu where the roaches can be as big as 3" long! But most indoor roaches you see are like NYC's, they're everywhere and no chemical I've tried has worked. Gonna try this, REALLY hope it works.
I couldn't stop laughing!!!! Hubby and I moved to an apt right next to the incinerator 😒....end of story
This is a great video.  I've been using the Boric Acid for years and telling anyone who had a roach problem.  However, this method is like chemical warfare on those lil mofos!  It's the food content (the sugar and eggs) that lures them into coming into contact with the paste.   I used to just put the boric acid(like coke lines) along the baseboards of the apartment.  But, this is ingenious!!
Trying this now I hope it works I hate them!!!!!
thank cuz i live in apartments n my next door neighbor is like filthy n since we are connected the roaches think we filthy too. soo imma try it n check back wit you
Thank you so so so much this is the best diy roach posion ever using the boric acid u saved me thanks!
My apartment is infested! low rent, I thought it was a steal, until a few weeks later I realized it's infested!  at night i'll be in the kitchen, flick the light on,& the entire floor is just crawling with these nasty little creeps.all over my counters, just....crawling,& being disgusting & theyre in my bathrooms too!  I bought the ingredients today, I hope I murder all these disgusting zombitches for good.It's been a war since ive moved in!
Great funny video. I wanted to cry when I seen that Roach. It look familiar!
Aurora i hate them !!
One day I was going to go to the bathroom to get my baby ness out of their and suddenly a huge cockroach came in to the bathroom and I scream on top of my longs
i enjoy your humor
cut the crap. Video start 2:11
Gracias esto me ayudo buena idea yo les tengo terror,condenadas cucarachas D: thanks boo
I have a brother who buys boric acid to get rid of roaches, but I never see them even getting near that stuff! now that I see what you did with it, I'm sure it will work! Thanks! :D
One night I woke up and there was a roach on my pillow right in front of my face. I threw the pillow on the floor, got a nearby shoe, moved the pillow, and smashed the sh!t out of that little sucker. I eventually moved and threw a lot of stuff away.
My cat chased a cockroach into my room, it's hidden in my laundry someone has told me cockroaches hate cucumbers and bay leaves.. is that true?
I live in Brooklyn and I'm currently renting a room. The roommates leave good out which doesn't make it any better. But I don't do roaches so yesterday I bought all the ingredients and I just finished putting it in the corners of the kitchen. I hope this works, because I can't live with these lil fuckin demons crawling on everything. P.S. I'm saving up for an apartment now.
Ugh! Thanks for this , ugh hate hate hate roaches they bring out my bad side ugh Lil nastys!!!
One question.  Does it smell?
Thank you!
Flying roaches are the worst they seem to always wanna fly at you though I live in Australia
this is the best video on youtube! haha. you've just saved my far rockaway apartment from these damn roaches.
OMG!  You are  fucking hilarious!!   Thanks for sharing this info, that your in-laws...  well, now out-laws(?)  ;o)  have  clued you into..     Cheers!  btw..  I think you are a BABE!  The only experiences I've previously had re. roaches, is when the guys in the band would take "roach round up"...  They were studiously.... smoked!! ;o)   *hugs ya*
Hi Maya, i just wonna thank you so much for the tip. & to tell you after 12.hours there was no more ants in my home. Unbelievable...
The bugs here in Australia are 5x bigger and mutated, you'd run for your life if you see one. Especially the flying roaches.. THEY. ARE. THE. WORST! hahaha!
Is there an egg smell to the poison mixture?
Had roaches years ago in my apartment in Brooklyn. I moved lol. I think they were coming from the neighbor but I told the landlord that I couldn't deal-he found me another apartment in another of his buildings. No m'am I don't do critters.
I jst tryd this in my kitchen I hope it works doe♡♥♡♥♡♥  I had them since I got my apartment I almost freak the hell out:/:/ one came out my sink I swear I start screaming

O.m.g. girl tanks soooooo much for your input
thanx for this..i have never seen so many roaches in my life. I just moved from NJ to GA and i am fighting this problem it almost makes me hate apartments because I know other ppl are not being as clean as me and I have 3 babies to have to worrie about..once I was sleep in my nice clean bed and a roach yes a roach was crawling around my ear needless to say I freaked out!!!!!!!!!!!!! we did everything and nothing is working I want to move soooooo bad but money is tight..we will be trying this for sure ;)
Omg! Thank u!!! I just moved into this beautiful home it's amazing .... But wait .... There are a gazillion roaches!!!! Ahhhh my counter top  was covered in gazillion tiny lil roaches omg I almost threw up! I started spraying each cleaner on them!!! And they were melting!!! I hope this stuff helps. Imma do it today ASAP. I m from California
Just made of batch of your bait, hopefully it works!
Girl I live in NYC, in the projects! In here is an infestation to the max, I knew about this trick (I'm Dominican) but it wasn't working, I didn't put sugar! I'm going to try it again with the sugar because I'm desperate!
One time there was 1 Roach when i was bathing and it was running all over the place and i was like jumping and screaming. Btw im 14 :D
I'm from new York
Will be trying this soon! I'm from Chicago and recently moved into an apartment that has BOTH a roach and mouse problem, I need to get rid of at least one them. Does this work with ants too because my sister has that problem in her house
London
I'll be trying this for sure. I'm in South Carolina and we have giant waterbugs that FLY. I'm talking they fly 30 feet across the house and smack/land on the wall beside you. UGH! They love wet places so the adore SC. Thanks for the recipe. I'll try this as soon as I get home. I do have dogs inside so I'll be careful to put the mixture high. Thanks again!
boric acid alone dries up the-roaches also!
Dried cucumber skins sprinkled with salt gets rid of ants!
Funniest comment section I've seen in a while
So do the roaches just die and renmain where they were eating or what?
I just moved and I NEVER seen this many roaches. Honestly who ever was living in this apartment was nasty. I will try this. I hope it works.
She just earned my subscribe
I'm going to try this at my dads house or my step mom will:) hope it works
My mom is LITERALLY the president of the "Absolutely NO Swearing" club, but one day we were watching tv in the kitchen with my sister and my mom saw a cockroach and she FREAKED OUT and started screaming "KILL IT! KILL THE FUCKING THING!" and then i smashed it with my shoe and then she creepily smiled and just said "BITCHHHHHHH!" lol This was when I was 9 and now im 18 and in college and i still won't let her live it down c: lol

Ugh... we just got a notice at our apt that they're saying for roaches then no sooner than they do I see one.  Ughhhh! My 2yr was like ahhhh mommy smash a bug! I almost died. Then I bleached everything and bought combat.  Bye bye nasty suckers. Gives me the heebeegeebees
Maya I tried this today. Crossing my fingers it works! Thank you!
maya, do you speak spanish??
Will the roaches eventually learn to avoid the bait? Because I had bait that worked great initially but stopped working. I tried almost everything!

We got a new tv and we had to move a few things around. Well are bird cage was in the way of a plugin so we moved it and see them ugh scared me to death.

I meant to say u lol
Although I don't have them thanks so much for posting! I had them ten years ago and they are the worst things! They multiply like crazy! When I visited Brooklyn earlier this year it seemed like that is the norm in NYC ...almost everyone is dealing with them! I'm glad he kept it real so others who have problems with it aren't embarrassed to try something!
Im From Jamica
I had roaches when I first moved in my new house on december 1 2012.  I used a mixture of dematacus earth and boric acid and followed the directions on the boxes.  Last roach seen in my house was december 31 2012.  So if you're having problems try this.  I got both products from home depot.  Life saver!
No joke, i have nightmares about roaches. The large ones. If i see a roach in my apt, i will go sleep in my car.
I am terrified of big bugs
I got tiny roches I live NYC queens
You're so beyond real for this! Love!
gurl!!!! i'm saying! i'm glad you tried this!
I Hope this works. I'm tired of seeing them all over my house. I sometimes even hear their long legs running around quick. If this doesn't work, I might as well explode my whole house haha.       Anaheim,CA
IM FROM AUSTRALIA MATE
Ugghhh....will be doing this today.......Im a kinda nature loving person..... but these annoying critters have to go today.... so disgusted and fed the heck up....thanks.....for the imfo and the comedy...lol......sending you love...

I'm from New Zealand and this worked, omg thank you so much. I didn't realise I had roaches until it was too late. :L thank you Maya.
We didn't have a roach issue until a friend moved in. Waaaaa!!! Now we have a big problem. Hoping this works. Miami
Sorry... It's, actually, called "The roaches have arrived!"
Everybody, please watch this  video titled "The roaches are coming" by youtuber Timaya. One of the funniest videos you will ever see... I promise!!
lmao...Too funny!!
Oh my gosh!! That is Gross!!! lol  And you are hilarious!!
lol Sounds like one of my stories with those bastards!!!  Oooohhhh, I hate cockroaches!!!! lmao
This past summer, my family and I went to the beach, and while we were gone, a big storm had come through. So when we got home it was one dead water bug for every room. & once i was lying on my bed watching tv in the dark and saw one skitter across my bed (I'm terrified of water bugs or any bugs btw). So I had a fit and burst into tears and had my dad tear apart my room until he found it, but he didn't. I guess it went down the vent...
Just did this hope it works! Xfingers crossedX
I had to smoke bomb my car. It was crazy. But I got rid of their cockroach asses....
Maya, I wish I had known about this trick for my granny. She had a roach hotel. I went to visit her with my kids and instructed them Not to bring anything in grannies house. My little boy brought his damn back pack. I screamed on the inside(not to alarm granny). Left to go home shoke the kids out, making sure im not bringing any guests.I was on the dan ryan going to work.Got damn roach crawled across my windsheild. I almost lost control of the car.My car looked like a snoop dog smoke session.lol
my short name is sev, usa (tx), went to mall, went to bathroom in mall, went in stall....ROACH. left stall, went to another, IT FOLLOWED ME in there, I went home to use the bathroom, >:O
Lol. Yes, yes it was. Love yer videos by the way. Yer pretty too. ^.^ Stay awesome!
Lol. It was. Needless to say, we're moving. Lol
I totally know how you feel;-)
omg i dont believe how hard i just laughed out loud literally.. but thats  gross
you a roach okay? You a giant roach.
Maya I can't deal tho..... I never seen a vlog on roaches, my nigga! Od funny
haha you don't pay rent loloool
They say the same thing about us..
fog the place then take the boric acid and spread it along all your wall and sweep it into the cracks and crevices this help. if you have nasty neighbors, then mop up any residue.  Next take vingear and watet mixed together and wipe everything down your counters, frig, stove-top, and all of your walls and doors, leave no food out not even in the sink, make sure you don't have any water leaks and don't leave paper boxes laying around roaches love paper
lmao i freakin love you youre so crazy!
THAT IS DISGUSTING!!!!
uh! stupid mice! i just encountered this problem and no this doesn't work on mice...you gotta block up any and ALL holes!!!
hahaha!!!
can you do this for mice aswell?
lol that I understand haha but no it doesn't take super long I would set the traps and go to work and come back and see them all over the place I use this bcuz I have a cat and baking soda is safe :0
i heard something similar but ain't no way in hell imma let a 2 inch roach walk around my home!
i don't want a slow death for them! hahahaha!
that's disgusting!!!! ear plugs for me when i travel then!
Canada. I hate dirty ass roaches too. They carry all kinds of germs and diseases. If you see one don't run, don't scream; squash that moth'r fk'r then you can run and scream because the longer you wait to kill it the more roaches coming bcause they communicate with a pheromone that calls them the spot. Another thing you can try is mixing equal amount of sugar and baking soda. sugar attracts, baking soda reacts with their digestive system and kills them a very slow painful death :) muahahaha
LOL!
this video legit looks like the set from Hikaru Utada's Music video Hikari
CHICA i know how u feel bout them water bugs, first ur a roach a fat butt roach, not a water bug. second my room is like roach central. i live in the attic part of my house and when they come out i think they're monsters trying to attack me,...NOO, I DON'T DO BUGS BOO
I've had it up to HERE with mine... doing this today!
I remember watching this video months ago and thinking "this is good to know if I ever need to assassinate some roaches" and sadly.... Now I do. Lmao at you gagging and trippin out, that's exactly how I feel!!! Fukkkk a roach. So anyway, I will be buying some boric acid and getting rid any trace of a roach #shameless style. Thx girl!!
I live in Barbados!!! Guuurrrrlllll listen!!! One beautiful night I was sleeping like a baby, I was on my side, my hands were clasped under my head,feet squeezed together tightly and knees allllll in my chest! (get the picture?) :D ..anywhore, I moved my body a bit and I felt something tickling me. I honestly thought it was my blanket so I pulled "it" up and I heard a soft "pop" sound.....Do I really gotta tell you that the guts were between my fingers?! XD
You are so funny! Love your video! ; )
omg going thru it in my apt in Queens, NY,,, funny thing my mother-n-law from dyckman did the same exact poison (only difference she added milk) and omg how did it work. its true they are seasonoal & i didn't have to do it until months later!!! but then i did it on my own & it didn't do Shit!!! im So FED UP I WANT TO LEAVE NY just cause of these Pest Roaches! but thanks Gonna try it again (No Milk This time) ;)  P.S You are pretty entertaining lol
The worst possible thing you can do apparently is smash them.  When you smash them, more of them show up.  They attract more of their kind with their smell when they are killed like some other insects.  I had unfortunately found that out the hard way.
hey girl i will be trying this just started today did exactly what u said.. my apt is totally infested theres always in my closet bathroom n now they want to hide in my room is totally gross i will let you know how it works i do hope they go away they give me the creeps i ordred out for 2 years cus i didnt feel like cooking in my kitchen =[ it really took my life
.. i feel dumber after watching this.
CHANCLETA! LMFAO!!!!!!! I loveeee youuu!
lol that is  sooooo funny DANG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
I live right outside Houston and I swear these roaches are resilient little f*ckers! You can put the bait out and smack them repeatedly with a shoe and they still seem to just keep on going. Freaks me out to no end. Especially those big ones the size of my thumb! HATE those! Grossest thing is when you smash them they end up smelling like almond extract! I can't eat anything with almond extract in it now lol YUCK !  Can't wait to try this out!
life saver now they down crawl on my feet when im using my computer.
lol you don't pay rent who invited you
Here is a simple solution.No cooking no mess. Go to the drug store ASAP, buy "Sonic sensor" electronic  device to repell rodents and bugs.Ever since I plug it them ( I bought 3 Pk, all six for 2 bedroom Apt.) No more roach problem.Of course still I keep the kitchen area clean without food leftover. Especially if you live int the ground Apt. or house, you need this stuff.
im from trinidad and tobago and i need to try that
this chick is annoying as hell
lmaooo hilarious. "No! No! No! You eat. Eat Up. Eat, so you can die."
the only time i saw a roach was when i was in somalia and i was 9. When i came back to Holland i was like praise the lord for my home sweet home. I can't even imagine having to live with the fear of roaches coming out any moment. Yes, I am a pussy like that and the worst thing happening here would be ants in the summer. I feel bad for you new yorkers!!
Had to come watch this video since people were talking about it at the LA meet & greet!  Yes, we were talking about roaches : )
Trying this right now.. Fingers crossed
oh yes they can in Puerto rico them roaches are huge and they fly sooooooooooo nasty cant stand it
oh my goodness I think I would have lost my mind that crazy....ewww im freaking out just think about it blahhhhhhhhhhh...
"Hide N' Seek"
One day I was playing hiding seek in the house with my sisters, I was about 10 yrs old and I was sitting behind a chair hiding and I remember looking down at the floor and I was like "What the heck is that on the floor?"..... it was the bottom half of a little roach roach...so now im like "eww wheres the rest of it?" So I felt something on my my lip so I started spitting I thought it was some fuzz or my hair and when I looked at it -.- "it was the other half of the roach!"
Lol I responded the same way when j saw one
you don't pay rent lol
You're hilarious! And thank you!!
i'm in Martinique right now, they are big and they fly, but i'll be back in France soon , yay !!
Lmao the beginning is HILARIOUS
Think I saw a spider egg sack in that cabinet...
You're a roach a giant roach lol
No actually roaches can fly, not all roaches but some have the ability to fly(well more like glide but they can do it) its freaking. Palmetto bugs are big roaches that flies... Yuck
Hey thank you so much for this vid i have not done it yet but you have given me hope =D the only thing i was wondering about is the egg part. Wont leaving egg yokes around in your house (kill the roaches obviously) but also leave a nasty egg smell all around your kitchen?
Why would I lie
Thanks alot i wont be eating it too for the rest of my life .. .___.
nope you may be wrong on this, I just killed a regular sized roach that was flying...had never seen one before and went to the internet to no avail. (it was not a baby roach nor a cockroach - just skinny regular kind) just gross talking about them :/.  calling exterminator tomorrow, cause if there is one there is definitely more.
Also my best friend was sleeping and one crawled in her ear all she keep saying was she could hear it walking around in there. She said she felt like she was going crazy she couldn't get it out. She ended up going to the hospital. From then on she started sleeping with cotton balls in her ears. Im itching just thinking about it.
from Houston, Tx and im having issues with these damn roaches i'm going to try this, but im going to bomb first. Cause I feel like im losing the battle here. Great video!
omg i used to live in New York but now I'm in Boston and now am running into those nasty roaches which doesnt make sense since my mom cleans like a maniac but I'm deff telling her to try this becuz now they even come to the room and i got to kill it but thanks for your help
that's ok, i'm not perfect :)
I just looked it up. Larger ones fly, smaller ones don't. You are wrong.
yes mam, roaches can fly and do!
Roaches can fly? Boo, I don't think your story is valid... lol
I feel so blessed to live in a roach-free city xD But we have silver-fish... Which sucks. And occasional spiders and A LOT of flies.
i remember one time, living in NJ, i was sitting in my living room drinking a beer, you know sat the can down for a few minutes, and then picked the can up to drink it, and the first swallow, i felt a lump go down my throat, and i though  i would die, i had swallowed a big ass roach, thanks for the tip, i think them damn roaches followed me down here in GA
Lol..she is funny
We don't really have roaches in London so I guess we're lucky lol
I'm originally from the Bronx so I know how nasty those NYC roaches can be. BTW I loved how perfectly you pronounced "chancleta". Love u boo!!
There was a roach infestation in my house and i was screaming all over the house. Then i saw the most horrid roach you would ever see looking at me like he was about to kill me and all of a sudden he flew straight into my mouth because I was shocked and down my throat. that was the most terrible feeling i ever had. later on the day though i threw up and the roach came out and flew happily ever after. i hate roaches so much
My friend and i went to the pacific Islands for our annual holiday vacay....came back home and she was complaining of a sore ear for weeks. Only to find out when she went to check it out at the docs...it was a roach...dead obviously. So they pulled it out but only half of it came out haha digusting...every time we go back she sleeps with ear and nose plugs lol
yeah i always have left overs. i either give it to a friend or keep it in the fridge. but when i keep in the fridge i always end up throwing it out
I think that's the reason why it didn't work. Actually I doubt your mixture would work at all to kill the roaches because the boric acid is what actually kills them. I think it dehydrates the roaches and they suffocate and die. I buy my boric acid from Home Depot for about $5 and sprinkle it all over my kitchen floor at night and that seems to have been working but Maya's method is a lot less messy with less clean up. Hope this helps =)
I keep rewinding this over and over im fucking crying @ 4:48-5:01 lol real tears!
4:48-5:01 bwahahaaaa bwahahaaaa bwahahaaaa ur crazy funny!
Thank god u posted dis
ummmm...there is no substitute for boric acid! especially not baking﻿ soda! hahaha! "what did i do wrong?"you clearly didn't try my recipe.
gross!!!!!! that's grosS! i also wouldn't eat egg if that happened to me!!!
Was doing my hair in the morning and was just about to blow dry my hair. Then one fell on my shoulder from the ceiling. I screamed so loud. Thank god no one was home. That would have been embarrassing. But it scared me so bad. Even more scarier part was when I came back into the bathroom. The thing was no where to be found.
i was frying up some eggs,so i cracked two eggs into a pan, turned around to go cut up some ham for the 20 seconds,came back, and i saw a roach swimming in my egg,and i was like WTF, it was like swimming omg it was nasty i hate roaches so much. PS. i haven't eaten an egg for like a year
yes i love your videos too! However, I tried the recipe and it wouldn't turn into paste.  What did I do wrong?  I did substitute baking soda for boric acid because I didn't have boric acid. Is that why it didn't work.
Lol it's soo tru! But here in RockawayBeach they crazy!!!!! They skydive n land right on u... I just found out they bite.. Omg  Craziness!
you must live in the city because i live in queens roaches are like x2  smaller but i have this funny story once in 6th grade while ill was in class i was taling and laughing being me the my friends nadaly look at my hair and said tiana you have a roach on your head i screamed sooo loud after that ever since ive been afraid of roaches and i always say thank god it was fake because if a real roach was in my real hair i would like die XD
Im not from NY but from Ark i wanna try this see if it works for me.
Lord I'm going through the same thing for the first time
One time I was trying to kill a roach on my wall and the thing started flying towards me! Had no idea that they could fly. I almost died. :/
I was walking with a friend and I was almost at the entrance gate for the apartment blocks that I live in and someone somewhere slammed a door shut. At that exact moment around 15 flying roaches just flew up into the air. Needless say I ran for at least a good 5 minutes to the other side of the village and then spent hours shaking my head to make sure there were none in my hair D: even thinking about it now and I feel like something is tickling my scalp o.O
Never saw a roach never want to see a roach
When I was 12, my family moved to Raleigh (North Carolina).  On our first night there, my sister found a roach on her leg (she thought I snuck out of bed and was tickling her).  When we started screaming, the roach started flying around our room. We were so scared, we refused to sleep in our room for 2 weeks.
We were talking about cockroaches yesterday with my sister and apparently years ago in a flat we lived in there was an infestation of them. I was 11 or so and I cannot recall seeing one bug! That's how traumatized I must be...
one time my sister went to my moms bathroom and she saw a roach on her shoulder yikes
Ima try this. I'm in queens new york.
"Water bug sounds too friendly...you're a ROACH!" LOL!!!
lol! It's protein :)
Love this.  So funny.
Imagine if that's how play dough was really made
welcome to the world of shamelessness Nichole!
I don't know how I happened upon your vids but you are highly entertaining and absolutely adorable. I laughed so hard at this roach vid. Subscribed!
Houston Texas tree sap roaches... shameless
Would this work for ants too?
there's a really bad roach problem in my hometown down at the theatre where I do shows and its really bad in the summer, so i contacted the head lady about 5 minutes ago right after i watched this and im going down there in two hours to take care of those little shits >:D
After u poison them they die and the others eat them and then die, this is a cycle so that's why they are mia for a while.
Not too long ago I was helping my dad clean the house and I was sweeping with the broom. I have a really extreme fear of cockroaches. My dad said he was going to head out to the store and he will be back soon so I just continued sweeping and when I looked up, I saw this CREATURE just climbing up the window a foot away from where I was standing. I was so scared that I threw the broom on the floor and dirt went flying everywhere. I just locked myself in the room and cried until my dad came
just sprinkle in as much fairy crack as you need :)
1-2 weeks
Lucky! I'm terrified of them
yesterday i was in my bathroom washing my face. It felt like a scene from a horror movie. I put my face towards the sink to wash my face, came back up, looked in the mirror, and saw it. its antenna's moving as it scurried up the wall right there behind me. oh I will make them some of this poision, and they WILL FEAST
Ok so I see cockroaches a lot in my room only and they usually appear on the wall but I always tell myself to wait till it gets on the carpet to kill it because I hate the crunch noise it makes when you step on it its just so ugh I don't have WORDS to describe ooo well
How long does it take for the roaches to disappear or before you notice their decline?
i live in jersey and all we have is spiders and mice... YUCK
Fairy crack
I loved the Chancla part the best :)
So has anyone tried this? Does it work? HELP!!!!
Another way is sugar and baking soda or brown sugar and baking soda. Roaches are attracted to moisture and sugar. But they don't know the difference between sugar and baking soda. It's THe Baking soda that kills them teeehehehehehehe #BOOMDynamite
Lucky you! It's TRAUMATIZING I tell you! lol
They'll keep coming back after a few months as long as you live in an apartment because the other people that have them aren't getting rid of them and they travel in the walls. This works. Keep redoing it every few months and they'll stay out of your apartment and it'll completely get rid of them if you live in a house. We did this and the first two weeks it was like Amityville Horror because they came out of EVERYWHERE, but then they disappeared and haven't come back.
Hey gorgeous,  So, after...let's say four months, do you remove the dried up concoction from everywhere? I tried sugar, boric acid and oil but im going to try this remedy instead. Please let me know. Thanks!  btw, I am the SAME about them. Like, I love all animals and have no beef with any of them, but when it comes to those filthy disgusting, disease spreading bastards I just lose my mind!! LOL. When I rinse one down the sink I turn on the garbage disposal with a sinister joy. LOL
Okay I'm back! So yea. It was in the drain, and you could see nothing but its long, huge, antennas poking out from the drain. My dad had to come in and quickly pull it out from the antenna. Once it got out, it quickly flew to my brother and attacked him! My bro ran into my room and we hid and screamed together as we heard the disgusting sound of my dad killing the roach with...something (I was to disgusted to look at what he used).
Hellos my fello Filipina! So, in Florida, unless you have an invasion of cockroaches, you don't get a lot. But trust me, when you do get them, they are HUGE!!! There was a time my mom got a broom out from the corner of the closet, and a flying cockroach attacked her. It didn't help I was exercising with my dumb bells at the time either.... That same cockroach grew, and it ended up in my sink for a whole week! (Tbc)
I live in Ireland and we have a load of daddy long legs spiders :S and the other day I was falling asleep and I felt something tingly on my face and i grabbed it, turned on the light and it was a huge spider ! It was disgusting!
the random aussie accent lol
don't drop it on my fucking head...lol
lol
OMG!!!! that's disgusting!
That was cool but I was more into you then the video you are beautiful
so im eating a bag of chips, placed the bag down for a split second and heard something in the bag moving, freaked out for a second, checked the bag and there was a *gag* freaking big roach! I freaked out ran to a corner, cried for a bit and stomped the bag and the roach into the ground! now excuse me as I go to throw up on this trip down memory lane!
OMGGGGGGG Roach on your face??? Ahhhhhh
i was eating cereal and once i got down to the milk i saw a roach swimming. i choked, died and reincarnated. nastiest thing i've ever experienced. i cried a litte too and didnt eat cereal for a good 6 months.
ah!!!! yes they fly down there. i don't know what i would do! i think i'd sleep in a bubble
lmao word, I hateee roaches. I killed 2 big ones todayyyyy. .-. Get the boot!
I Shouldn't Have Watched This Now I'm all Paranoid Thinking I'm Going To Find a Roach & I Don't Even Have Any.
Ooh goodness. I was so disgusted when it was moving its legs XP
your lucky

You are beautiful Maya!
I would die if I saw this in my home... Never saw one in Wisconsin, but while vacationing in New Orleans I got my fair share. The mere thought sends chills down my spine.
Girl those mugs are DISGUSTING -__- I scream at the top of my lungs every time I see one. They stay checking in and out of my house like its a damn hotel.

(5.00) My chancleta hahahaha nose si vas a entender lo que estoy escriviendo, pero me vie como 4 veces esa parte y cada vez me mori de la risa XD Me encantan tus videos felicidades Maya.!!
Ugh! I hate those nasty ass roaches!!! They are disgusting and within the last two weeks ive killed three in my apartment!! I am so paranoid that before i enter a room or closet i turn on lights and peep around cornors so im not surprised. I live in VA and these roaches range from HUGE to small....im so trying this trick. Thanks for sharing!!
@igamingpublic a roach in your mouth ? :0
I had a german roach in my mouth while I was drinking coffee. most disgusting tasted.
Those really big ones are Water-Bugs in NY, you only see them if your place has a water leak or its been raining like crazy. Other then that you wont really ever see them. Now in GA they are called Pomelo-Bugs and those B" just be every where for no reason, nasty!
Florida roaches be like daring the chase you lol no joke I just throw something one is on my closet somewhere it ran in there I saw and my closet is dark ,we have all kinds of bugs down here talking bout a water mocosin or how ever u spell nope roach
Lol
when u see some roaches, put some nail polish on them. so you can follow them and see if they return :)))
fairy crack. :)
i just found the biggest one ever im now here on yotutbe me and my sister are crying because we just moved to this house 1 week ago ahahhaha
wont the eggs smell after a while?
and thanks M!
sooo is it like a genocide of roaches laying around that I have to find and clean up or do they die elsewhere?? You know, just trying to mentally prepare..
good thing that's not the case
un poquito :)
i wonder how humans would look like getting their stomach squashed while moving their arms and leg...
I hate roaches...they are so hard to get rid of down here in FL...and nobody is spraying for them except them. These roaches are big as you and  "THEY FUCKING FLY" !!!
That's disgusting!
that's normal. they all come out to eat then they disappear! give it another week
The ones in New Orleans are bigger boo lol don't come in summer
How long on average before we should notice a result? I ask only because I set it all up a week ago and it seems like I am seeing more than normal.
She speacks Spanish
no it doesn't hurt to touch it. you don't need a lot just put it in corners and crevasses since roaches like to run in those places
omg i hate roaches fuckin gross lol when i used to stay at my aunts house during the day youd see maybe one or two in the kitchen but at night if you turn off the light them lil fuckers come out like soliders and might carry you off
omg i hate the ones that fly lol
hey the poison obv doesn't hurt you to touch it...does it hurt to put it  out  a lot if ya don't have any youngins or pets,?   Thanks I hope this works..I just bought some boric acid at the market the other day..I am going to mix it up like yours and give that a try too. .I don't ike sprinkling it on the floor..etc...it kinda reminds  of the gel they have here.. the way you make it u...But I cant afford but maybe one tube of that..."   Im gonna try thanks  for the video....Peace
it usually takes 1-2 weeks. trust me when i say it gets worse before it gets better, but then they are gone like donkey kong!
Not Chancleta!!!
HA sprinkle in more fairy crack
Giirrll I did this yesterday, and my mom thinks it works overnight, cause we're still seeing the roaches do know how long it would take to take effect? Or do they just disappear?
Your gorgeous!
Thank you mami, these damn roaches been having me in rambo mode lol good way to save some time and go back to using chancleta's for what they were made for......Whoop'n ass! lol take care
Will it still work if you keep the left overs in the frige or better out
Lol 00:04
I live in Sweden Crap There Almost as big as two goldfish i hate it i have to wait till 1:00 in the morning to clean the house
Lol fearless much?
Who invited you, you don't pay rent...... lol hahahaha im dead heck nah,... i can't,  your face had me rolling i can't!
The nastiest roach story I have is, I was at my exes moms house to see my kids and I got a bowl of chili out of the fridge. I nuked it and was sitting eating it, got quite a ways through the bowl when I saw on my spoon a half a roach. ( I only took half a bite so guess where the other half went ) I looked in the bowl more closely and saw more roaches.  I threw the bowl and threw up all over. I haven't eaten chili since and haven't been back to her moms house since.
Oh ok, When I went to Walmart I don't think I looked in the laundry area lol. Thank you
Should be at Walmart or your local type store in the laundry area. At least that's where we find it here in Missouri.
We don't live in NY , but MO instead. I am going to try this here because I am at my wits end with these damn things. Just went to the kitchen a bit ago and spotted and killed 6 big ones and 2 tiny ones.
I've been living with roaches for the past 4 years. once 1 got in my ear. most excruciating pain of my life. enough is enough. im going to try this. wish me luck. I live in fairfax virginia. wtf.
Tears* oops
I swear I love you :,) you got me in years
Lol !!
Going to go pick some up first thing in the morning..Oh it's on now! Lol Thanx for the info : )
Absolutely hate roaches , i mean who doesn't ? one time i saw a fly roach , never saw a waterbug hope i dont see one of those ew .
Not all roaches fly, I even see it here in this country -___- ...and I know some other countries have flying cockroaches. I'm not dumb.
Home depot... any hardware store, it cost like $3.00. Just be very careful where you put it (children & pets should not be able to get to it)
There are definitely flying cockroaches here in New Orleans. I mean 2" long smdh Even bigger. My brother visited from Milwaukee and thought it was a beetle smh lol
Can you please tell me where you purchased the boric acid from?? I cant find it anywhere!!!!
Lol... Thanks for the info!! Will try!!
Lol, good video but lucky you dont live overseas. They fly and fight you like Joe's Apartment smh...
I ONCE OPENED MY CAPENET UNDER THE SINK WHERE WE KEEP OUR TRASH CAN AT AND WHEN I OPEND IT . A BBBBBBBBBBBIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGG ASSSS ROACH BY MY HAND...lawd jesus. i could even tell youu. how scared i was.... lawwdd. let me tell you...

AMEN. :333 <3 love you btw. :D
ARE YOU SERIOUS?! That's crazy!!!
all roaches fly..they all have wings -_- its not just your country,
I live in the Philippines and a lot of them went out this night. It was horrible. I only went downstairs when my mom and brother killed almost all of it. I was so confused as to why they bother attacking us today. ~I was washing the dishes when it landed on my hand. So disgusting! then when I was about to enter the bedroom a roach went flying over at my shirt. F***!!! I wish I live in a different country where it doesn't fly.
lol "waterbug sounds to friendly. your a roach. a GIANT roach" lol
girl so im havin the same problem and I'm trying to use raid but it works for 2 weeks only im glad u made this vid.
i so f**king hate roaches! thanks for the vid. They are going down!
My grandmother would use Roach chalk that she  would get from the Asian market. Know that shit worked lol
Thanks
Does this work for any roach? I'm raking these tips for when I have ma own place
make sure its out of reach from kids and pets...my dog ate one when i first got her and threw up...never again!
you ain't paying attention!
what is the recipe .how much of each ingredient
Lol fairy crack
Water bug does sound really friendly...
Your fucking weird
I live in Queens (Within NYC) in a apartment and fuck, I see these waterbugs comes out during the night by the kitchen when I clean the kitchen. So now, it's time to die. I will set this up tonight and place them around the kitchen and bathroom. Hope it work!
i wanna try this for real!!!!! i live in south east georgia and girrrrllll they are some kinda badddd here!!!!! grrrrr!!! sick of em!!!!
Thank u for this i did it today but 1question wen did the yoke smell go away
Chancleta :)
THOSE ARE THE ONLY KIND OF ROACHES I GET AND I LIVE IN TEXAS. FML.
I had a roach in my bathroom and it started flying and I live in Alabama haha
I feel you girl
Girrrrl! It's like 5 in the morning because I just killed a HUGE waterbug! (like the size of the one you were talking to on the counter) and now I can't sleep! I feel like I'm in hunting mode lol. I'm glad you posted this but I don't think I can handle luring them in here to get rid of them. I'm already bad at leaving them where I spray them to death with bug spray, so I know they haven't moved!! This is only the 2nd one I've seen in 6mo but I need something that would repel them all together.
I need a shower after watching this {><} I hate all bugs...except for caterpillars, ladybugs and butterflies the rest can all die simultaneously lol
gansta!!!!
You burned a roach???!!! BAD ASS!!! LOL
LMFAO!
I can not breathe, oh my god.
I live in Michigan and when I was about 12 we got our kitchen redone and when we knocked down our cupboards there were thousands upon thousands or dead cockroaches practically touching each other that had been there for years it was one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen in my life and I couldn't believe they had been there for so long and i never knew it. How disgusting!!!
try sprinkling flour. The roaches will eat it then explode!!!
Hi Maya..for how long do i have to do this?  i started just last night & i just leave the stuff there.  I woke up this morning & i still saw a few....Thanks.... hope to hear from you soon..By the way, are you from the PI?
Lmao girl do you know your hilarious !? :-) ctfu you had me in tears
Maybe about 2 weeks ago one night, I walked into my bathroom and there was a "water bug" on the wall right behind me, I saw it in the mirror lol. I swatted it with a broom and broke the broom trying to kill it, then maybe a few days later a gigantic roach was in the SAME spot and it scared the hell out of me. I got a can of air freshener and a lighter and burned it lol. I wasn't always scared of roaches but I had one crawl on my leg before... never again...
Lmao, sounds like a homicide.
when i was in the 8th grade i was getting on the bus walking to the back my usual seat next too my bff when a huge flying roaches landed right on my shirt!!! i freaked out nd hit two ppl trying too get it off of me...Oops!
Yeah I pretty much vacated my last premises because of this problem, and I'm a very clean artsy fartsy gal. Now I know what to do if they invite themselves again. AAAAAAH! ROACHES ARE SCARY HAIRY :<
Hahaha At first I was like "regular beauty blog girl, okay, whatevs, its cool"...then I seen the reason for shaving your hair video and was like ..."Okay yeah I'll subscribe to dat" but now This and I'm like she keeping it all the Reeeaaal! Yes Maam. Dig it!
Fairy Crack lol
do i put it at night time or anytime? i have a real bad problem i think it's cause it's summer time but i made the batch & put it all over the kitchen & bathroom i hope it's effective
Question about the leftovers, do i store it away in the fridge or what?
I'm so trying this! I cant stand those things :(. Sometimes I can hear the bigger ones marching across the counter!  I was walking to the train station from school one day and I saw a 'butterfly' flying towards me.I love butterflies,so of course I stopped to look at it.But it was no butterfly, it was a waterbug flying right at me! Up until that moment I had no idea those things could fly. I ran down the block like a crazy person.Roaches are gross enough already, why do the big ones have to fly??
same here!
i am scared of all bugs
so I was in Belize this winter for vacation and they have these bugs called ``coconut bugs`` but really they r just huge arse flying roaches and when I say huge I mean some of them r the size of a fist and one day one decided to get all up in my grill aka mouth eww I swear I GAG when even thinking about it oh lordy
I was in pathmark last summer.. after spending an hour shopping ...I get on line.. put my food on the conveyor belt and am gonna waiting patiently as the woman in front of me so searches for her wallet in her bag.. she finally finds her wallet.. pulls it out her bag and along with the wallet comes 5 ROACHES !!! Back to back... I freaked out and left all my food at the register... had the heebie jeebies for the rest of the day!
do it! it works!
Yes, they call them "palmetto beetles" down here in Atlanta, but its a glorified flying roach. If you leave a window open overnight, lawd hep ya chile. Cats love to eat them though. So I suppose that's a thing. Otherwise, Im down to try this. Especially since I dont want to pay pet rent.
Oh people say they bad in the south. well. I live in Lousiana and I'm from Houston so I don't know if there worst in NewYork. But, if you act like you about to step on them and kinda buck at them some of them don't even move they just look at you. Then you start seein them tiny ones like the babies and you hink eww they must be doin somethin. Well enough is enough they gotta go somewhere else cuz my place ain't no motel for some nasty lil bugs. If you can even give them that name.
The same thing happened to my lil brother when he was in the shower he looked like he wanted to cry.
hahaha!
This is an GREAT VIDEO I AM SO TRYING THIS
wow imma tell my parents bout this were ffrom ny too but moved to ga this year n its worst they come from the drains and garage doors down here too crazy lol
Lol chancleta
From Washington heights and we used to have a roach problem but my dad took care of that but my neighbor down stairs had a huge roach problem. It's gross cause they try to come up to my apartment but they don't last long lol
New York manhattan
yay!!!! finally a long term solution; our roaches act like they need a solution to get rid of us!!  now...i'm gonna be ahead of them :)
I heard baking soda also poisons them.   It's SO evil but....  When they eat the sweets we prepare for them, the baking soda they eat reacts to the acid in their little tummys..... causing to EXPLODE.  MWAHAHAHA... ahem....    Then, when they die, the others eat the dead ones, who also get infected.  Spread a roach pandemic!  I also can't find boric acid.  I'm going to try the egg mix, but all you'd need is baking soda and sugar, 50/50.  The key is water, too.  I love your sense of humor.
I was on the living room. I felt like part of me died a little there! Yesterday my hub killed 2 and today another one which almost tried running over my foot. Anyways thanks for this vid i will most def be trying this out i really really really hope this works.
I couldnt even scream or else D; Now fast forward 10 yrs later and those bitches never leave and never will! And no sir im not used to them and i will never be. I hate it, every spring all the way to fall those mofos always come out! I feel like now they are trying to celebrate their 10 yr anniversary cuz last week one of those huge SOB was trying to climb on my side of the bed where i sleep. I feel like any day now they will attack =::( this very same year another one walked on my leg while i..
I have a few nasty experiences with roaches! The one that scarred me 4 life was about 10 yrs ago. It was around 1:30 am, i was laying in bed zoning in and out of sleep when suddenly out of no where i hear this disturbing wing flapping/buzzing sound in the air and before i had any time to think about it or move- BOOM! There it was. The SOB landed on my face right on my lips. Its disgusting body and hairy disturbing legs touching my lips ;'( the antennas touching my nose (oh god why!!?) I ...
I lived in Miami the roaches are like the size of your hand . Thats nasty uhh
Who you telling? I was raised in Atlanta, but I live in Texas now. There was a roach at school one day that was the size of my fingernail and everybody freaked out about it. In my house in Georgia, them damn roaches were almost the size of my damn palm! Ain't NOBODY had time for that!
dayum! that's like serious trickery right there
i am from tahiti in french polynesia and we do have a loooooot of roaches and the most terryfying thing is that they also fly, soooo scary!!
THROW-UP!!
:)
hahahaha!
yes! warmer climates, those suckers fly high!
thats a good way to do it
You are truly shameless, luv that about you.
girl u crazy lol today in school i saw a huge centerpea it was nasty me and my friend stand up the tables
BTW-I heard the roaches in Hawaii can FLY!!! Sweet baby JESUS and all the Saints above, how or why is this possible? I would have a seizure if I was there and a roach came flying after me! Get out the caution tape, the chalk for outlining my body, and fashion me a crystal encrusted toe tag because baby-I would be Decease-ed!
OMG! I love this video-Roaches can carry up to 21 diseases! Hell No they GOTS to GO! Take ur broke asses out my crib! You ain't got to go home but you can't stay here'-cause bitches you ain't gots THIS HOME to chill @ anymo'! Get your refugee-looking asses out with all yo' shit! Don't forget yo' boarding passes and ALL documentation., your belongings,  yo' little roach shoes to fit yo' 8 nasty roach legs/feet and form a single file line and MARCH on up out my life muthafuckass!
Omg I live I North Carolina and I seen one in my apartment and I literally moved my entire room into the living room! I called the maintenance guy and he laughed at me! Lmbo! I'm like "hey not funny i cldve died!"  i moved to another apartment and bam i seeing them again from time to time. Im like "but my house is clean?!" and people say it dsnt matter. any way im frm CT an we ain't bout that life I moved here a few years ago. So this tip should help me a lot
Yes! Roaches in the south are beasts!!! LOL! Down here in Louisiana, we just get the Boric Acid and just put it in cracks and crevasses to kill the roaches, but this is a new lil recipe I will definitely pass on :)
Me and my cat was chasing a "water bug" around the house last week
My mom uses boiled potatoes instead of the egg yolk. I will try it out
DISGUSTING!!!!
The roaches fly in South Carolina.  THEY FLY.
Lmao!  You're hilarious! Thanks for the tip!!!
Was eating cereal and a baby roach floated to the top
ha ha your right...they don't even run when they see you in the south...LOL....be squaring off and ish....lol
LOL at having a block party! great video.
I found roaches in my juice and almost drank it
Omg ill have to try this. In the winter I called Orion but I saw like 2 the other day and they were gone ..they must go
yes they are disgusting!
it doesn't mold :)
There is nothing like Florida roaches, since we live with so much water around we are a bug's paradise. I was doing great bug free until I got a new neighbor and now I am at war. I will be trying this and if it works on these gangsta Florida bugs it should work anywhere.
I'm from Saudi Arabia eeewwww I fucking scared from spiders
Tel Aviv I'll try it! Ewwww rochesssss
Quick question does anyone know if it molds because of the eggs?
But dont you have to clean up the dead bodies?!
The Beginning Had Me Cracking Up !! LMFAO
YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS THEN! i did this when my apartment was infested! worked like a charm. nothing worse than waking up and night and finding them having a block party!
hahaha! i found 1 dying or moving super slow and killed it. i usually see the dead bodies in the building hallway. they like run out for "fresh air" and die! but in my apartment i only found that 1
Wait... I'm just a little confused Maya as to whether they eat it and leave your apartment and then die or do they eat it, die where they stand and you'll have to clean up the dead roach bodies. Lol ???? Please answer!!!!!!!!!  Please!!!!!
OMG I love this & I love you! Wish I had known about this when I loved in the Bronx & dirty Jersey! lol
I meant baking sheet. And I said tin, but I meant foil. Actually, it doesn't matter what kind of baking sheet--a simple, cheap, disposable one is what I used.
My wife and I live in DC and had a really bad roach problem.   Another excellent (and toxic-free) method is to take a tin baking sheep, place a small plate in the center w/ dried vegetables and/or fruit (or whatever works best as bait). Around that, spread Diatomaceous Earth (which is food based and safe for pets). It will destroy them.  Thanks for the tip, Maya.
omg OMG Soo telling my mom about this, ever since our backdoor neighbors moved in 2 years ago, WE'VE BEEN INFESTED. AND I MEAN IN FUCKING FESTED. THEYBROUGHT ROACHES WITH THEM UGH. I dread when I have to get up in the middle of te night to the kitchen or bathroom omg they are EVERYWHERE. hope this works!
"It's guts are all splattered and IT'S FUCKING MOVING!!!!"  Lmao so gross, so funny.
I 2nd that. Chile, I'm from the midwest and the roaches there are the little ones & waterbugs, which aren't roaches. Honey, when I moved to Mississippi, I had my 1st encounter with these jokers here! They FLY & they HUGE! I've always been afraid of them, but when I saw that thing flying towards me. I ran screaming like Jason from Halloween was after me. I'll leave they house & let 'em have it. I HATE THEM SUCKAZ!
since we don't have ants up here i don't :(
it does! give it a week max!
I just put this mixture all around my kitchen hope it works! *fingers crossed*
Awesome...do you have anything for ants lol
Such a cute little background song for such a mass killing lol but THANK YOU FOR THIS
Is it for every city
hahaha!!!! well good thing this video is still here for everyone else!
they sell them at hardware stores. make sure it's 100% boric acid
it's so GROSS!!!! the same thing happened when i moved to Harlem! they were gone during the day then at night they effing took over! so gross! i'm so glad this really annihilated ALL of them!
my client totally needs this. thanks!
You are funny
You're so funny
HONEY!!!!! NY roaches got NOTHING on roaches in the south. Talk about the most gangster roaches ever. You step on them, they pop up like "yeah whatever, to Johnnie" [insert 5 additional roaches] LOL and they are so much bigger HUGH! This was in Alabama. Being from the suburbs I never saw roaches .... Went to school in the country. GIRL! Where was this video when I was in college LOL
im sharing this with my momma!!!
I remember when I had roaches, my cat would just sit there and watch them walk away.
i love your voice!
hahaha! i can imagine being all snipper like shooting those bugs with your spray bottle
Water Bug...UGH!  A glorified name for a super cockroach! I live in an apartment building (in Chicago) and I get these big bad boys too!  I have a water bottle that has Pinesol and water in it.  As soon I see one I grab my Pinesol and Water mix and spray the hell out of it till it dies!  It works, actually!  Cant wait to try your method...but your Shameless.....not me....hell I'm using gloves!
**** cockroaches i can't figure out where the heck they're coming from
hahahahaha!!!!!!!!
As soon as I started watching this video I got the creeps and started looking at floor just to check that there were no cucarachas. EEEW! D: Cucarachas are Roaches for those of you who don't know spanish. :)
thank you sooo much. I am having the same problem. we just moved in here to find out that we have roach problem   EWWW!!! YUCK! I am sooo understanding where your coming from on this one...completely gross! Im trying this. Hopefully it works for us too!
I thought that fake bug on the counter was real I started to freak out because I thought she was just letting it chill there LOL
bah!!!!! right?! i'm obsessed with Martha Stewart! it's her line I bought from Macy's. it's all so colorful!
i was traveling to go home one very rainy day, and while waiting for a taxi, a cockroach tried to crawl up my jeans D': ... it was so disgusting and embarrassing cause i had to prance about to get it out .... i'll never forget that.....  i'm from trinidad, W.I. btw!!..
OMG I just started swatting at my arm after reading this. LOL
this is off topic, but where did you get that colorful knife set? sooo cute!
I like the way you say " okay "
Can't stand bugsss ewwww
i know all about those suckers too! had tons up in Toronto! but trust me when I say they are nothing compared to GIANT roaches! both are uber gross though!
Lmfao maya! I don't think we have roaches in Minnesota. .. but we have june bugs which to me they look the same.  These June bugs are blind and the stupid creature FLIES! They scare the crap outta me! Lol I'm sure they look like roaches
Thats me every fucking time i see those creatures...fucking gross..<3:D
i heard but how can i let an effer just walk away?!
use containers you don't plan on eating out of :)
let the church say amen!
I never really liked calling roache's water bugs either. That name makes me think of them swimming in water and thinking yea that's right I can survive in water to bro you can't get rid of me. *laughs evilly*  I'm originally from south Carolina and roaches loved to come out in the summer and they freaking fly. Roaches are smart and they love scaring people but there also stupid because if I see a gross bug it will die we can't co-exist in a house you are not a person.
Fairy Crack!LOL Maya are to funny!ツ
All I do is take them out of my house oh I do with cake them out of my
I hope that's not a bowl or utensil you use with the poison and all. After taking microbiology.. You don't know what's still lingering after soap and water.
Haha I love it when you swear
I hope she doesn't use the utensils to eat again....
You're not suppose to squish a roach. It's possible that it can leave eggs behind. Use a spray to instantly kill.
Youre not suppose to squish a roach. It's possible that you can leave eggs behind and other
funny!! fairy crack...
I've tried this for roaches and it did kill some ants too since i used a Roach/ant killer.

I live in Maryland and roaches aren't the problem, stink bugs are.
Well, a good friend of mine was planning to move to Atl and she found an Apartment.  She went to see the place , because she was  down south  she asked if the place has roaches. The lady told her "we treat every week"  .. Short version.. She moved in, while cleaning up finds LOADS OF dead roaches under all kitchen appliances and cabinets, as she wiped the walls, the crawled out from the cracks! So yeah, she currently resides in Michigan!
and...??
me!
Thank u so helpful
btw your really funny so i  pretty much just subscribed and i am now watching all of your vids lol
omg i live in brooklyn and in my entire 22 years of life ive NEVER seen a roach in my house but i just came home from college (see my video) and the guy next door is exterminating and now ive seen them in my kitchen omgggg ewwwww im gonna try this out ASAP like tomorrow
Is anyone else really itchy after watching this video?
In 3rd grade we went on a camping trip and I was on the top bunk in my cabin. As I was sitting there, I got curious and lifted one of the ceiling tiles. Immediately, a "cricket" jumped out and crawled off my bed. The next morning one of my friends starting screaming and pointed at a roach (Texas sized) on the pole of my bunk bed. Apparently that "cricket" was actually a roach and I had slept with it on my bed for the WHOLE FREAKEN NIGHT.
My mom has a few friends stay in our basement for a few months while they were getting back on their feet and they infested our house with roaches!! It's been over 10 years since we've seen roaches and they brought them back!! Thanks for the useful tip lol definitely going to tell my mom
try it! if it can work on nyc effers i'm sure it can tackle cali mothas!
my mouth just dropped open! now that is gross!!!!!! so gross!!!
man we use to have to wait befor just oprning our bathroom or room door because they liked hanging out in the top crevasis of the door so when you opened it you had to wait untill a bunch them fell and then you walk through smh
Wow does this smell though?? I'm going to try this!
Tempo from D.R. works well!
my brother was attacking me (jokingly) and then he ran away because he said there was a bee (in my room) and i thought he was lying but then when i stood up i saw a big ass cricket perched on my shoulder. I INTERNALLY SCREAMED AND SLOWLY WALKED TO MY BROTHER AND MADE HIM GET IT OFF. IT WAS A FCKING FLYING CRICKET. NO. I HATE YOU NATURE'S CRITTERS.
In the uk mice and rats are usually the problem omddd these rodents are smart and disgusting yuckk! I called an exterminator i cant be dealing with that ishhhh
Omg does this work on any kind of roach???? Like California roaches lol
hahahaha!!! chankleta so funny the faces you make =D
omggg i hate them!!! when i was little i went to mexico and they have tons in the ceiling in corners and i remember i went to the bathroom and i look up and there was tons hanging out in the corner i couldn't even shit in peace lmao even when you shower they come vist you!
When i was little i went to my mama friend's house in the hood and i felt like weird like something was watching me and i looked up at the ceiling and it was like 20 roaches on the ceiling i ran out so fast i never went back in that house or the hood
Thanks 4the Advice.!!!..
a water bug actually is a roach. it is an oriental roach, more specifically. they like moisture and damp places. we are in the south and I frequently see them in my basement. eliminate water sources for them.
here's one: i grew up in the philippines and one morning i was getting ready for school. so there I was sitting in the kitchen waiting for my breakfast to be served by my maid, and VOOM! a roach flew into my shirt from behind. That woke me up from being groggy and cried like a baby!
Wow. i didnt know u cuss like that. DANG. just chill out. lol. that was funny though
Im from ny and if u got rid of them..baybeeee u got a good formula right there huni....
Harlem!!!
those flying ones are the worst! i remember when i went to the Philippines i was those suckers for the first time! that with mosquito bites and lizards?! not cute!
i didn't but i do see dead ones in the hallway of the buildings!
Woke up with a roach on my pillow. I died.
Love ur facial expressions!
I love your makeup
Mice+roaches=NYC  lol
Do you see the dead ones around? You just said that they just disappear
okay I lIve in california but I visited the philippines when I was like 6 and I was at my grandmas and I woke up on the side to like crawling and I had my mouth open and the roach was about to crawl in my mouth and it started flYING
One day I was chilling on my bed then I heard some litta critter legs run on the floor so I look and I seen a roach nothing major I just got the spray I had done sprayed that thing the crap started flying I was like oh hell no it's gone kill me I thought it was chasing me so I ran out the house so fast I ain't stop till I was down the street The End
I am completely terrified of cockroaches!!! AHHHHH! Ugg, I swear, when they start flyin... crap goes down.
Lmao I love you Maya! But okay I was going to use the rest room and there was a big old ugly add roach that came out the wall and then right after a second on came out and I sprayed it with frebreeze then with Lysol and they kept touching each others antlers like it was some romance movie lol. Then I smacked them both w/ a sandal at the same time lol
Great idea! They really like animal fat and they do have to eat it for it to work. I didn't have roaches til my neighbors moved out, and their bugs all migrated to my apartment. I'm in Washington state, so bugs are smaller--but still gross, and prolific at breeding!  I'll have to bomb my house B4 trying this though--their FLEAS moved in too!  YUCK! For areas where you can't put this (carpets, etc) look up FOOD GRADE diatomaceous earth: It won't hurt your pets. Directions available online.
I used to work overnight as a supervisor. One night as I made my rounds, a hearing impaired man stopped me to mime an issue he was having. He said there were more roaches in the area than usual. As he was telling me that, I felt something moving around in my slacks, nearing third base. Horrified and not wanting to rip my pants down in front of the guy, I clutched at the (I cringe as I type this) wiggling thing in my pants and run to a restroom nearby and rip down my pants and there it was. nasty
I  going to try this!!!! My manager won't do shit about the roaches in our apt. He told me to pay for an exterminator! Like i have the money.I bombed the place myself but there are still babies!! Its traumatizing. I hope this works. Xoxo
It would mean a lot if you would subscribe to my channel :} I'm new to YouTube <3
I'm going to try this. I have tried everything and my last step is a professional. I'll try this first. Thanks and thanks for making me laugh.
I laughed so hard hahaha
Does this work on the giant Texas roach?
No way, you live in Washington Heights?! I live on 190th!!! :D
Can we use any roach killing powder?
Just saw a roach crawling up my curtains.Now every little movement of my clothes I think there's a roach on me.Trying this tomorrow.
It's 12:36AM. I've never had a roach problem, yet I'm watching this. Oh my god. Maya, you were born to entertain. The first minute had me laughing hysterically If I ever have experience some roaches in future homes, I'll be sure to use this trick. Thanks girl! ❤
Fuck off BITCH!
This is a real ass video, not a lot of people would have the balls to put a video like this on youtube, let alone admit that they have roaches.
Doesn't the egg start to smell in your apartment?
i cried when i locked a mouse in my closet and waited for it to die :(
wATER BUGS ARE BIG ASS ROACHES WITH WINGS, WHEN I MOVED TO GA ONE FLEW ON MY FRIENDS GLASSES... I RAN FAR FAR AWAY
Do u have to use that powder? Can u use a different?
un poquito :)
gurl!!!! i picked this up when i was living in public housing. it works! believe that! just make sure you keep it away from kids and pets. my dog ate it when we just got her and didn't puppy proof the apartment and threw up :-/ she's ok now but lessons learned the hard way
I live in Dallas TX i had moved into a very cheap apt (long story) but yea they had sooooooo many roaches! First night went to the kitchen for some water and i kid you not there was a MOB of them.waiting for me in the cup board they all crawled out at me it was like a tsunami of roaches flowing out of the cabinet!!! I moved asap didnt even take my stuff out of there!! I am forever terrified lol
1:51 LOL
Thanks Maya for the tut I'm definitely trying this TODAY...living in public housing (I hate saying projects) means having to co exist with them, they move in b4 u and never leave smh. I only have a problem with cockroaches in the summer because they get in thru the vent and the pipes when the heat is off but I'm chalking the crevices so that won't happen, wish me luck!!!
Do you speak spanish I loved the slow dead that my chancleta doesn't offer jaaaaja
I recently rented a house from this old couple in killeen tx and they failed to tell me about the HUGE roach problem. Anyway I went to open the back door and like 5 of those muthafuckas fell on me. I was so terrified when I saw them everywhere. I kept my furniture in storage and slept in my car for a month. I moved to a townhouse that is roach free. Thanks for the tip!
Cursing so bad
U dont pay tent, lol
Yea Maya. You said you were in the hood on ur draw my life with roaches and piss in the halls and here your proof wow smh
@loveyme013 YUCK!!!
Thanks gross yuck
disgusting!!!
that is so gross! "baby mice in a roach body"!
gross!!!!!!
I think calling them "water bugs" actually makes them sound waaay more creepy. I be like "whaa...??! Them f*ckers don't drown!!?" Eeehhheeewwww. *shivers down spine*
one time i went to the bathroom at night and went to peee and when i got to get some tiolet paper a big ass roach was just sitting on the roll when i spent it ughhdhiehcbl  :(
Yea, I'm from Austin and those roaches are thee WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No matter where you go or how clean you are.....and they're huge. Some of them even fly.........ewww. They call them Water Bugs, but they aren't nothing but roaches on STEROIDS
Yes!!!! I can't stand it!!
OMG I WISH I WOULD'VE WATCHED THIS VIDEO WHEN WE HAD THOSE WATER BUGS!!! WE JUST MOVED TO San ANTONIO Texas AND THE FIRST NIGHT IN OUT APARTMENT WE STAYED IN A HOTEL THEM BIG ASS ROACHES WERE EVERYWHERE!!!!! WE ENDED UP PUTTING BORIC ACID AROUND THE BOARDER OR OUR PLACE AND SEALED EVERY SINGLE CRACK!!!! WE HVENT SEEN ONE SINCE THEN IN OUR PLACE JUST OUTSIDE AROUND OUR AREA AND OUR APARTMENT MANAGERS SAID THEY WERE WATER BUGS TOO BUT THEY LOOKED LIKE BABY MICE IN A ROACH BODY
ARE YOU DOMINICAN?
omgggggg that was big!
I hate those things! I'm in Florida, one time I sat down on the couch with my plate of food getting ready to dig into my wings when one of those things flew out of nowhere and landing on my shoulder! I was bout to go off!!
that's soo Dominican.. that my chancleta doesn't offer xD
Geez I have got to try this! The raid crap that they sell kills some but mostly makes em run. I'm sick of seeing all these baby water bugs every time I turn on the light in the morning and yes I have put everything in airtight containers. I don't even use my kitchen drawers anymore cause of them. It's been months of chasing these lil boogers around my kitchen ... spraying, spraying which doesn't do crap .. supposed to control them for 12 months NOT!!!!!! I am so sick of these things.
Hahahahaah sprinkle like a fairy !
When it comes to bugs it sucks living in Florida cause we pretty much have every bug known to man
So I'm from Florida and one night I was going into my kitchen and when I turned on the light there they were ROCHES!!!ewww so I panicked and was like...ok you can do this and I killed one! It was so gross!!!
OMG OMG OMG ok..
In-laws?
Omg!!!!!  I would go crazy!!
Florida roaches fly -_- ... And I'm tlkin about the "water bug" roaches. I HATE THEM!!! They're so huge and ugly and disgusting !! Ugh!! I'm getting pissed just tlkin about them. But I seriously have a phobia of roaches because I cry when there's one in my bathroom (which is connected to my room) or in my closet.
Omg!!!! You are Hella Funny n cute @ the Same damn time!!!!! I'm gonna try this cuz I'm n the Bronx and this Bx roaches are smoking blunts n got the munches!!!! They gots to GO!!! By any means Necessary!!
did you try this? when i used boric acid alone it did nothing. but mixed with the eggs and sugar it worked like magic :)
I'm going to try this though.. maybe they aren't eating the boric acid like I think they are.. lol
boric acid doesn't work around here... they eat that shit like candy... smh.. damn shame..
Where my house is located here in Kentucky, I'm kind of in the forest but relatively close to the road at the same time and I remember looking over as I was putting make-up on and seeing a wood roach crawling on my pillow, I literally screeched and like attached it with my boot. I was so grossed out, then in my closet there was one and I remember hitting it so hard it splatted like 4 times its body size, it was so grodey.
Boric acid is the truth when it comes to getting roaches! I hadn't heard of making it a paste, gonna try it next time. I remember the day I went into labor with my son was because a HUGE bug landed on my face while I was asleep. I jumped up and screamed! You have never seen a nine months pregnant woman move so fast!! Lol
I friggin agree with aliciasears96. Those joints are crazy and they're fast.
Chicago= centipedes. Idk what's worse between the two.
My sister and I were home alone and we were watching Kardashians.. I know, right?.... Anyways, there was a roach that kept on hiding behind the pantry, in the kitchen, under the table, etc. So she took a broom and when she tried to mash it, it flew on me, into my shirt and then left. TRUE STORY. I screamed like a baby. And blubbered like one too. I made sure to scrub myself extra hard that night.
HOW LONG DOES THE MIXTURE LAST??
I WOULD'VE DIED...LITERALLY...UUUUGGGGHHH...
I used Enoz Roach Away and I haven't seen a roach since last year in May of 2012. But I used this the next time I see them again. Hopefully not!  Thanks and sharing.

I live in Tallahassee (Florida) and we have roaches just as big. One time I was putting my shoes on (we leave our shoes on the porch) and when I put my foot in I felt something moving and I flung my shoe across our porch a the roach went flying it was HORRIBLE.
I wanted to know if you were married!!!
0:31 - 0:39 maya your too funny
Lmaoooooo
I already was depressed and miserable about having to move back in with my parents.  To make matters worse one night at their place I opened a cabinet and felt a thud on my shoulder.  When I looked the roach and I made eye contact!  I LOST IT!!!
One night, i had just come out of the shower, all squeaky clean in my towel, then BAM! a cockroach just flew onto my shoulder out of nowhere, so i started running around the house and screaming like a mad woman while the roach was still comfortable on the back of my shoulder -_- it eventually flew away, had to shower all over again!...scarred for life!
D:
Don't like them things at all!!! Nice to know!
poor thing ):
Order it from amazon...
Thank you!!!!!
I meant 2n half our
I'm from florida so I live in a apartment n 1 time was going 2 get a drink I walk out my bedroom door I turn and I saw a 12 feet cockroach I scream so loud I was about to throw my shoe at it but I didn't because my whole body was shaking so I stay at my room for an 2 n ha
I went to TSU in Nashville, TN and one night I was about to take a shower (communal bathroom smh) and this BIG ASS red cockroach approached me at the door and would not leave ( joke is that he was tryin to holla lol) and when i was about to step on him, he got mad and ran under a random door lol...those bugs and animals in Nashville are hood man lol...
I'm from philadelphia.. & I remember this one time when I was little, I was at my dads house in the den watching t.v. & I was sitting on the couch, So all of a I felt something on my leg & I looked down it was a damn water bug crawling on my leg. I hopped up so fast & was freaking out I stomped that thing so much  u couldn't even tell it was a water bug anymore.
This one time i was drinking malta, chillin then a baby roach was climbing up it, and i did not know, so by the time it got to the mouthpiece, i took another drink..... And I went berserkkkk! I spit that shizz out instantly. I brushed my teeth and cleaned up my mess of course... It was terrible.
I'm scared to death by ROACHES!!! have had horrific experiences with them.. flying on me.. waking up in the middle of the night by a roach that crawled on me -_- but I live in the Netherlands and haven't seen any at least where I live... but I do see them back home in the caribbean :S
Who gets paranoid when you see these?
Water bugs as different. We have those in DC. They are all black and they only like damp places. Here is the secret we discovered to kill regular roaches: go to the Chinatown in your state and ask for "roach chalk".  You take the chalk and draw lines around the door posts and corners of cabinets. It really works. It effects their nervous system. Only down side is, it may be dangerous to you too... But at least it works! You'll wake up to roach corpses everywhere. Look like a battlefield.
THAT IS SOOOOO GROSS!!!
I have an extremely creepy gross story for ya'll. Ok so I use to teach at a school so you know school=lots of books&papers=roaches.The entire staffroom was just too cluttered n dusty so all the teachers decided 2 clean.My coworker was just cleanin out her desk when it appeared, one huge ass roach, so she started to scream...my other coworker got a shoe n started trying to crush it, roach said oh heelll no not today, and flew into my screamin coworkers mouth...she gargled all evening with soap...
omggg too funnny 0:52
lmaoooooo water bug  sounds to friendly. you a roach.... no a giant roach
I live in NYC & I'm on the 3rd floor.The ceiling of the entrance on the 2nd floor started leaking those BIG ROACHES started coming out like crazy. I once came home & saw 1 crawling up my wall and on my table& then I saw 3 the next night.I was going crazy. I couldn't sleep, I was having nightmares they would crawl in my room.I got the big roach bait patches, about 16 of them and put them in every corner.I see them no more ;-).Just have to change the patches every couple months.
Got it! Getting rid of these effers immediately.
I'm scared of bugs but i'm lucky. I'm from the Netherlands so no roaches for me here :P
Whew!!! I'm so glad it don't live in Texas anymore! Waterbugs flying around in the heat of the 100+ summers... naw, ain't nobody got time fo that! I remember the night before my family moved to Mn my brothers, cousins and myself were all at my grandparents house in his library and oyt of nowhere a huge one flew out and was headed directly towards my cousins ear. It hit his ear then fell his lap. Ugh, gives me the creeps
I was born in new York but now I live in Iowa we no roaches lol yay for me p.s. I think your b.e.a.uitful
I live in Florida. Roaches are abundant here, unfortunately. :( I had a lot of trouble with them last summer. Hopefully I won't have those issues again. It was absolutely horrible.
We'll I'm from the south and one night I had to pee really bad. I rushed to the bathroom without turning on the lights. As I do my business I feel something wet under my feet (I knew it couldn't be me) for some strange reason I decided that I needed wiggle my toes in the wetness (gross I know) once I finished I lifted my foot up only to see a half smushed waterbug which then ran away from me into the corners. I jumped into the bathtub with all my clothes on and tried to wash all the disgust off.
I live @ Curacao we call roach = Kakalaka. We don't have season change and when it rain season in the carribean we have a lot of bugs then and if i have to go give the dogs food I have to run to ta dogs and run back in because the roaches will be flying around !!!
they come in through the pipes! i would throw baking soda/vinegar or ammonia down the drain AND put this stuff in corners. it's spring so these effers will be back in full force!
These disgusting creatures are only in my bathroom area and my bathroom is spotless!!! D: I don't know if I should put that stuff out because its obviously not from food, and then next thing you know, they start SEEING food because of the bait and they invite their nasty little friends and .. ugh EW. JFEIORSJGRIOAM BLEHHHHHH
H town baby , & my neighbors dirty roaches be everywhere !!! Ewwwewwee
I lived in a apt in Florida that was infested with the big bugs omg I'm serious we were killing them 4 times a week. Those things will live in your underwear if they can. I had one crawl across my face one night in bed.. I couldn't sleep. They were everywhere! When we moved we complained to the office 29 times. When we moved to the new house we had boxes of covered dukie from the roaches where the lived and hid.
AGHHHHH!!!!!!!!
i have no idea why we freak out over those disgusting things! but yeah...it's gross! and now that it's spring those effrs are coming back! now to go back some cookies
roach cookies!!! brilliant!
Lmao fairy crack I'm done lol we call those roach cookies
I'm from Texas, and this one time i got out the shower and i grabbed my towel. At first i didn't feel it, until i looked at my back in the mirror. GUUURLL I RAN OUT BUTT NAKED TO MY MOMMA. Shiii was scuuuury
you are beautiful i want your hair!:(<3
Miami we got them big suckers and they like to be called the Palmetto Bug. I dont find them tropical at all. They are huge, have wings and fly! Welcome to Florida, ugh! lol Once I was using the restroom and it started to attack me I felt so helpless because i was stuck sitting on the toilet and not to mention embarrassed because i had to call my guy cousin t ocome save me and im all half nake. #shameFUL lol. I hate them things
This is sooooo helpful. Thank you!
you know when you just watch something on bugs and your whole body starts to just itch and you start to squirm and just jiggle like somethings on your body.... well yeah i did that when watching this and i dont even get roaches in london lol.
that's cray cray!
i saw one on my pillow right when I was getting read for bed. I screamed and woke the entire apartment.  that shit's not cool
omg the roaches in nyc are gigantic!!
In Louisiana they fly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What camera do you use?
This video made me itchy xD.
you know what Maya? just because you said "Chancleta" you have made a subscriber out of me FOR AS LONG AS YOU ARE ON YOUTUBE. :LOL--I hope to cross paths with you sometime in the matrix, cuz you rock!! LOL
I simply hate bugs! I just recently moved out of my mom's house to my first, and might I add, very own apartment near the University of Cincinnati. After a month, I am seeing roaches everywhere. A semi hoarder just moved out last week and I think they are coming from there. I told my landlord but honestly, I want to move already! I'm going to try this tonight though. My only question is: did you have to clean up the dead roaches from your poison grounds?
In the French Island the roaches are insanely more bigger than yours! Lucky You! And They also don't wait until the night for going out... check out: "ravet martinique" in google image Lol! you'll be scared
wait.. you said chancleta O.o where u from?
In Atlanta we get them during the summer time. They come in because they are looking for water only. I buy a spray and spray my apartment every two weeks and don't have a problem with them.
doesn't the egg start to smell? :S
That was the scariest thing i've ever seen...apart from reading that article that said a slice of pizza is over 500kcal*shivers*
Oooh i'm so glad i havn't seen one before ! The part where it moves at the beginning scared me to death. had to hide my face like a baby haha.
Can't stand waterbugs!!!
argh!!!!!! so scary!
Lol im from the Bronx and the roaches come from my neighbors !!!!!
Hi, do you speak spanish?
I wish I can do this but my daughter gets into EVERYTHING! Thank God the landlord comes every 3 months to do the pest control thing whatever it's called. So no roaches for me! :D
I don't live in NYC, I live in Mississippi, but one time I was watching TV at night in the dark and out of nowhere I felt this weird itch on my hand. So I just went ahead and scratched it and when I touched my hand I felt something that I knew wasn't supposed to be there. So I screamed then ran and turned on the lights and saw a HUGE ass roach on the rug. I was so traumatized, I went in the bathroom and scrubbed my hands with soap and hot water for like 10 minutes.
In My House If You Kill It, You Clean It. So I Killed A Roach And Had To Clean It And Right When I Went To Sweep It Up Like 10 Mins Later..... It Started Twitchin And Movin So I Was Screamin And Jumpin Like Some Crazy Fool. Roaches Are Blehh.
i remember the last time i saw a roach... it was midnight and i went to the bathroom and i saw like 2 big ass roaches on the floor.... i started screaming and i killed them with my shoe.... ughhhhhhh
my family really does this too.
Lmao Maya you're crazy srsly this is how'd die react too
I was doing some work & it was next to me in my bedroom !! I was under-pressure or I knew I would not sleep that night.
a hammer?! that's insane!
I moved from Montreal to NYC almost 6 years ago now... Giiirrrll I remember my hate from spiders in Montreal and just used a vacuum cleaner to kill them... but ROACHES from NYC are ants from another planet... they can see I know... it is hard to kill... I have sooo many stories.. but I had to face my fears and kill them... the sandals don't kill the big roaches, I had to use a hammer once to kill one of them... HATE THEM!! will use this recipe for this summer. Thanks
i remember when i was lil and we li ed in the Bronx.when it rained we would get water bugs. They woukd come up from the drain in the sink ewwww. I dispise them w/a Passion
OMG, I guess their called waterbugs, no you're a roach. Girl you had me on the floor, that was the best laugh I ever had, I think I got an abdomen workout. I am with you I can not stand no STANKIN ROACH, suckers. LOL (Smiles)
Once i had this friends in my arm and so was terrifing!!:x I had a cat,but aparently he was to lazy to eat them! But this is a really good advise,thank for that :D
This is why I will never move from California lol, maybe visit, but NEVER move lol jk. Who knows, but one sure thing is that where I live the biggest problem I've ever had was spiders, huge disgusting fat spiders. Once I left my window open for a couple of days and there was this huge dark brown spider crawling across my floor. l leaped over it and demanded that everyone in the house wake up because I wasn't killing it. my bestfriend had to stab it with a broom 10 min before it k.o.-ed....yikes!
Jajaja "chancleta" that a puertorrican word right? :)
that is terrifying!!!
A roach chase me  when i was in the bathdroom it was so big ooommgg i run out im not scared of roaches but this one chase me....  =^.^=
Come over to Houston, TX they are 3 times the size lol
I have a PERFECT story about roaches for you Maya.  Okay, so I was casually watching TV and wanted something to eat, so I got some bread out and some mayonnaise. I started spreading the mayo on my bread and I kid you not, there was a big cockroach that appeared out of nowhere ran towards me and jumped on my pant leg. I freaked out and shook it off then tried running away from it. It CHASED ME!! I finally killed it after tripping onto something. I was terrified of mayo for a while.
Lol too funny
The scariest bug I saw was a praying mantis lol. I never seen a roach in my area.
well your cat is awesome!
you need to! this was filmed in October and it's now Feb and I killed only 1 and that's because my cousin left the window open!
i can't deal either but it works!
lmaooo!! "been real quiet ever since"
Yup they are dinosaurs now just imagine them 350 million yrs ago when they were about 3.5 inches long! I cant deal!!
My mom accidentally smuggled some to PR inside a microwave. We lived in a basement apartment in Yonkers!  You can get rid of them lol!
Lmao @ the chancleta!!  I've been dealing with these random visitors ever since i moved to nyc and i hate em!!! definitely trying this out and hoping they die!
I live in Brooklyn, I brought a cat, so I have a furry friend and no bugs.  My cat is a hunter
i live in chicago and we get these centipede/milipede things...it's horrid!!
Lmfao.
Omg I wish I never watched this! It grossed me out so much that I have been gagging since I saw it like 2 hours ago. I should have heeded your warning lol
Lol gurl you must haven't seen a big roach before because that is little. Down here in the Atl the MF roaches are big as Hell!
I live in jersey but like by the mountains & in spring the roaches come out to play and gurrrrlllll im not having that. so ill deff be trying this. btw your have some gorgeous hair !
omg so gonna try this at my moms... her place is crawling with them... LIKE seriously she has gotten fogged, roach sprays to kill them and they still come back!! Quick question does the egg yolk smell and rot when u leave it out for months? or do the roaches eat all of them???? Please let me know !! Thnk you Maya!
It awesome...i've never heard of this recipe before but i will definetly try it out....Im live in Dominican Republic and i loved it when you said: "Chancleta" :P ...Love your vids!
LLMFAAOOO
You crack me up but so real!!! I received mine in a gifted box. Since then it has been a fight... I'm gonna try thisbone as the other motes does not work...
right?! this stuff is the truth! i saw 1 dying maybe a week after and nothing since this video! wahoo for dominicans!
loved this video, these ny roaches are the worstttt, i swear by this boric acid recipe u just made, we use it all over the house and poof they are gone, it was so bad in our house that these stupid roaches started coming out in the daytime they usually come out at night when the lights are off, woo hoo yay for dominican recipes :)
Lol
@TheAristoKrat17
love you too boo! thanks for commenting
In Texas those bitches fly -___-
So in love with You and your Shamelessness . lol   :D
Another product that defiantly works to fight off roaches is ant killing stuff that you could get a hardware store. It works miracle but I mind you it smells horrible !!!
oh! that's because i'm speaking Spanish :) my family speaks Bisaya :) i'll make a Pinay Pride video soon :)
What filipino dialect does ur family speak? I noticed what u called flipflop/sandal is not the same that we call it. I think my mom calls it chinelas. #juscurious :) love the vid and i will use this trick
I once saw a shack sized roach at my gmas house lol...... Sprayed him with raid nothing happend hit im with a shoe was still scwermin .... Finally after bout 5 mins he was really dead lmao....Bt my cuzzo n gma are fearless i was screamin like a newborn i swear..... Lol
bisous bisous! roaches are the grossest things ever! but this does work!
haha! i hope so! i guess since they're my kids i'd think they're gorgeous regardless :)
that's crazy! i've seen them in Toronto but not nearly as big!
omg! that's insane! definitely do this! it works! i found one dying a month or two ago and haven't seen one since!
bahhhhhh!!!!!! yes!
"You a ROACH . YOU A GIANT ROACH" :) , JUST SUBSCRIBED !!
Georgia. Winter of 2010. The roach flew, YES, flew at my mom's face. She was traumatized. I'd tap her shoulder to get her attention and she'd like falcon punch me in the face. Thank you so much for the recipe and I'm so happy I found your channel
Ha the bottle says roach and ant killer...
This is so random but you and your husband's children will be gorgeous. Filipino, Dominican, and Black wow...
I'm from French Guiana in South america.. Girl, I can talk about the cockroaches, they are terrible and invasive.. at home we all try so hard to keep them away from the house as possible. Anyway thank you for your tips ! Bisous !!!
glad you find me hilarious!!! i used to be the only that laughed at my jokes :) you MUST do this!!! i found 1 giant roach dying a slow death and haven't since one since! it really works! i thought it wouldn't on the giant ones but it does!
Those roaches are so small compared to florida ones. WHYYY GOD, WHYYYY.
So the egg doesn't start to smell? Or rot after a few days?
I despise roaches too! Have you seen the ones that are disguntingly huge but not only that, they fly!!!! OMFGG gross!!! Thanks for this DIY roach kills, I want to use it but at the same time I don't haha
I don't have roaches but let me go wash my dishes.
Ahhhhhhh, the beginning of this video!! I know I was warned, but i was not mentally prepared for that LOL! . I'm gonna try this though, I live next door to a desert and ever since we've moved in, we've had water bugs crawling around our garage, and since my brother moved in, theyve been coming in the house, i'm the only one who actually tries to physically kill them and i'm afraid i've become something of a serial killer... of sorts
Lmao Washington heights best kept secrets!
OMG they like to call them water bugs or "palmetto bugs" down here where I'm at too! They're really bad when it's hot outside. One time I saw one crawling on my desk and I freaked the fuck out. I slept with one eye open, all of the lights on, and a bottle of Chlorox in hand for the next week.
Oh and don't get me started about chinese delivery, I ordered egg foo young, it sparked a childhood memory.Opened the box and dined not even stopping to look at the food, I guess I was hungry!LOL! Anyway I was halfway finished with my omelet and I looked down at my folk and guess what I saw. A Roach was sticking out of the omelet that I just scooped up to eat with it's long antennas sticking out and eyes looking straight at me. Uuuagh!!! I stopped eating egg foo young for many years after that.
I went to a italian resterant that  I suggested  in Morris Park. I  lived there  and frequently went there to eat I even my familyeat there.  I boasted about it and even recommended the place to other people. We were seated by the kitchen ed in the back of the resteraunt. I ordered my usual bruschetta and fried calamari while we were waiting for or food a big roached dropped from the ceiling onto our small table right in front of us. Without even talking to the manager we stormed out and left.
Do you need to store the leftover mixture any place in particular for it to "keep," like the fridge, or can it just sit in the cupboard in the plastic container?
hahaha! well make it for her! i don't get how some people are immune to roaches! i refuse! :)
From DC...used boric acid (straight no chasers) sweped it under the base boards and placed n the window seals...been real quiet ever since...
one more suggestion,you can put this mixture in "beer bottle tops" the roaches eat it out of there.this way you will have easy clean up when it's time to replace the mixture.we do it all the time
yes it does.i used it on ants.all i did was mix the sugar and boric acid.you don't need the egg :)
i've been using boric acid and brown sugar mix for years down here in GA.it truly works
I'm from Ohio but I went to vist my aunt in Delaware and she had cock roaches EVERY WHERE!!! I rember eating cereal and then finding roaches in my bowl that I had already been eating!!
Does this work with all bugs
I am from NJ and I came for a visit and stayed w/my aunt. Her house was infested! She acted like they wasnt there. They was even in the refrigerator! I refused to eat there, so I ate out. I kept all my stuff in the zipped suit case. After 3 days I made an excuse that I had to fly back and she drove me to the airport to fly home but instead I checked in at a airport hotel and had a great time the rest of the week in NYC/NJ. She needs your roach stuff by the bucket!
yeah maybe because i did the same thing and i havent seen one in like a good 3 or 4months u have to fill the smallest places because they can go thriugh tiny tiny holes too roach spray works also so youll b alright
you are soooo funny!!!! So glad I found your channel!! You're gonna be big!!
So if I may ask what did u do to get rid of them. I live in NJ and have them in my apartment. Not often... I will see one every month or so. I am terrified of being home alone in case I see one. I need my life back! LOL. I tried roach spray, I bought sticky traps, I hired an exterminator and had my super come in and fill up holes but there must be holes that need to be filled that maybe we cannot see.
omg i thought texas was the only place that had flying roaches!!theyre everywhere!!!! the first time i seen one it was on my wall and when i tried to kill it.it started to fly towards me it was like it was chasing me and i  almost diiied! i cried for a good 5 min to my mom about the whole situation. and mind you the flying ones are like 10xs bigger than regular cock roaches.after that i went to walmart and went crazy on roach spray and the sticky thing that u lay down so they can get stuck.
Roache sin hawaii are so much worse, the size in this video is babies compared to the normal ones :(
I live in NYC and the big ones definitely fly!
i'm not sure...but boric acid is for bugs so maybe? let me know if it does or doesn't
yay!!! thanks for tuning in :)
no. no it doesn't. i just went through the trouble of making a video on something that doesn't work.
i don't know :( you'd have to look that one up
You can be talking about roaches and your videos are STILL enjoyable to watch!!!!! Lol
this was hilarious! All these old london flats have little mice and roaches everywhere as well. Now I know what to do to zap them!!! They freak the shit out of me!!!!!!! I want a ShamelessMaya TV show!!!!
this is the first time I've ever seen any of your videos and i totally just fell in love with you
no probs! glad i made you laugh that hard:)
hahaha! naked! i'd do the same!
I wonder if this would work for ants? I have a serious ant problem and cant seem to get rid of them. I think there is a huge monster mound under my house maybe lol
thanks you for the advice - i was trying to find something else to do other than bomb my house - i'm in Dallas,Texas  and yes they are called water bugs - i dont like them either
Lmfao
what is ur nationality?
TOO MUCH
OMG I just died laughing at this comment. I broke a broom in half smacking the HELL out of a roach.
Hell no! Omg u had me laughing so hard I started coughing! I was visiting my cousin in NYC, she was having a big party. I went to the bathroom looked down and there was a HUGE cockroach on my foot...I screamed, when I went to leave the bathroom I had an audience in the hallway...all laughing at me. Thanks for the recipe!
I'm so scared of them, Yuck
I was Literally screaming the first 40 seconds of this video.... ugh now i'm paranoid something is crawling on me -_-
they probably pay the exterminator overtime!!
You have nice hands. Lol
A ladybug flew into my grandmas ear
You're awesome for sharing this.  I'm doing this TODAY!!!  Crime, noise, and even Hurricane Sandy are not the problem with living in NYC.  It's the dang roaches!!!
Yeah my grandma and aunts call them waterbugs. I call them roaches lol. Do you know if this would help kill spiders and ants too? Ugh, I hate spiders and they always come in whenever it gets cold.
Anyone ever wonder what people in these rich NYC penthouse apartment high rise buildings do about roaches... rent can be 10,000 a month in some of these apartments.... how do they keep roaches out????
I am actually about to move from my apartment BC I can't live like this.... but I feel like I will never find an apartment free of them completely :( I don't want to deal with them at all
Hey Maya! Random question...what lighting are you using? I really like it! Thanks :)
I'm so happy that i've never ever seen a roach or whatever it's called in my house or anywhere
Thank you! I'm from FL, but when I was living in GA, my sister went to open our attic and a giant cockroach flew out onto her chest. We both almost died from fright and being grossed out. It was insane lol!
That's EXACTLY how I feel! Ughhh, some people just don't understand.
trust me I was born and raised in New York and some how them roaches just use to get into my house I hate them so much .. that's a serious mixture u got for them nasty things.. LOL. .its great that it works..
ooh tu puedes hablar espanol???
My dad is from the south and I know exactly what your talking about!
Ew.
I'm Dominican too! My mom did this in our old apartment. A good tip for when they come out and you just gotta kill em. I hate guts! My mom has a homemade roach poison: 1 bottle of green alcohol, and a few blocks of camphor, put it in a spray bottle and let it sit. Kills em quick! This helped for the day I got in the shower and it was on the curtain! I jumped out naked, put on gloves and chancletas, and came after it with this spray like a madman with a machine gun, screaming! NYC roaches yo. -_-
Please please please do a daily skincare video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I really wish I knew this back when I was staying in the dorms my jr year at Howard lol. Creepy tale: I had a nice lazy Saturday and decided to chill in bed and watch tv after waking up. Those plans were interrupted with a quickness when I felt a "plop" on my lap- the biggest roach ever had just dropped from the ceiling onto my lap :( that was just the worst roach story we had them all over that dorm room. took me a year to stop my precautionary hopping back after opening a kitchen cabinet lol
I Miss you SO much!!!!! You're my favourite!!!
oh & we live in Hawai'i.
About a week ago my roommates & I declared a war on the roaches in our apartment. At first, there was maybe 2-3 spotted but within weeks, they were EVERYWHERE & it freaked me out (I wanted to move out immediately). Finally, we set off a roach bomb...didn't even work for the day...next we went a little crazy and set up 24 roach pods & 4 "Hoy Hoys" in their favorite places. I also sprayed EVERY CORNER with a Raid Barrier spray...........basically, it took many battles, but WE WON THE WAR! :)
i fed the egg whites to my dog Jackie :) i didn't put that in in fear or some random allergy your pet might have
Friggin genius!! Another annoyance of living here in NYC is MICE!! I wonder if this will work on mice??? Our neighbors always have mice (cuz dry nasty), and sometimes they're house guests think its ok to venture over to our brownstone!! No bueno!!!! So, I'm gonna try this recipe out and stick that shit behind my stove and refrigerator where they like to hide!! BOOM!!! Thanks Maya!! Oh I live in Harlem!!
born and raised in brooklyn so I've seen my share of roaches and other things...we have cats so I don't see them too often but just the other day I saw a giant (size of my thumb) waterbug. SO nasty! it crawled up on my wall and my dad used one shoe to smack it off the wall and the other to kill it...  I. HATE. BUGS.
Florida wins the vote on largest flying roaches!!! Damn if these NYer's flew I would seriously move!
this is true!
that's so gross!!!
that is so gross!!! a fly flew into my friends ear and was alive buzzing. he had to go to the ER and do the same...i can't get over home many people are speaking on this
exterminators are temporary solutions. this shameless formula actually is better since they eat it and die and any new suckers catch on that your home is protected and go elsewhere. bombing only kills the ones you have but new ones can come in.
thanks! i forgot to add that...just did it :) i'm using a fotodiox pro 325a
You should make a growing up in Canada story!
Hey I stay in Jersey and we did it have roaches for years it was heaven lol until new ppl moved in next door and honestly there not clean... But yesterday I saw my first roach and got so upset cause I hate them so I will def be trying this before more start popping up... Thanks =)
You're hilarious :D AH I just subbed to you channel ^___^
Wait, do they eat it and die somewhere else for u to find them dead later on? Lol
You are hilarious!
lool "sprinkle in more fairy crack"
*True story: Seventh grade, I'm getting ready for school and was doing my hair shirtless so I wouldn't get hair all over my school shirt. I kept wondering what that tickling was until I finally look in the mirror and see a pair of antennae chillin on my shoulder like "you missed a spot". Que my total freakout.....even now its making my skin crawl to think that thing traveled all the way up my body to eventually be hanging out on my shoulder. Friggin water bugs!!!
OMG, I had the same situation with rollie-pollies!
Omg, it's okay if you couldn't do a Halloween tutorial, this tutorial was worthy and now I'm scared. I live in Vancouver and I've never seen any of these in my life! holy crap they're huge!
Does this work for ANTS?
Thanks for the geek info....i love the quality of your videos... your content and personality is fresh air to the youtube world...what type of lighting do u use everything is so clear and your skin is glowing?
do u have anything for mice
So what do you do after they all come out and eat the poison? Amazing video though! I'm moving to Washington Heights in couple of months and I'm glad I came across this.
The bombs work too, and some Spanish thing called tempo
Im so glad I came across this video! I am horriblllyyyy afraid of roaches, and I live in florida. I plan on moving to new york soon! thanks girl lol. :)
To Oliviataensa with the gnat problem just cut a piece of paper and make a funnel out of it. Make sure the whole at the point is real small and stick it in a wine bottle with a ittle bit of wine at the bottom. By the time you wake up in the morning the gnats will be floating at the bottom of the bottle. I have to do this everytime I buy bananas and plantains. Those little buggers will not die with spray.
I feel that exterminators don't really help. They don't trully get rid of them. If that were the case I would just pay an exterminator and b happy lol
NO......You could had ate the eggs whites! What a waste.....lol
Who invited you??? Lmao
Here in Florida those bastards fly. Scared the ish out me. I'm from Philly so I never saw a flying roach or as they call the Palmetto bugs.
ummmm get an exterminator the best investment you could ever make give it about 43-4 months your problem will be solved!!!!!!!!1
The was the most useful creepy video I've ever watched! *shivers*
I'm liking the video and oh yeah I currently have a gnat problem that i need a fix for
Haha 'My Roach Story' in the deep south in Louisiana very traumatizing I had to grow around them one crawled on my after I came home from school in my cute little uniform let's just say it has scared me from attempting to kill the common creatures in my life
LMAO!!! No you didn't, Maya!  I can't stop laughing. First, I totally feel you. I hate 'em with a passion especially the BIG ones. Your reaction is my same reaction but it was funny as hell to see yours. LOL I actually never seen so many roaches until I moved to Florida. Gurl! They call them palmettos or some crap, like they're some pretty little things! The ones here are huge they come out when it rains n I totally freak! Man, I needed a good laugh! Absolutely hilarious! You need your own show!
"trick it aint even halloween, not fo a few more days!" hilarious had me laffin. so glad we don't have that here in london i could not deal. i already have problems with tiny ass spiders! lol
I was also thinking I don't know if I want to try this because I don't want to see lots of them around in the beginning :/  I wish I could find an apartment that doesn't have them... omg I would pay a ton of money to find that. And I pay a lot for my small one bedroom. 1,500 per month.... helppppp!!!
When my dad was younger a roach crawled in his ear!! It was in there for almost two weeks!! GROSSS. He finally got it checked out because of the pain and they had to flush it out... that is my WORST nightmare! BTW: This happened in the Bronx. New York roaches are ruthless lol
NYC represent and yess roaches are MADD nasty
Omg ty for this video. I have lived in 3 dif apts and have seen water bugs in every single one. I keep my place spotless. I have even moved from NY to nj trying to get away from them. Now I'm I'm nj and I see one in my apt Every two months or so. They make my life miserable. I hate them... i may need to move to outer space lmao....THANK YOU FOR KEEPIN IT REAL! Nobody want to talk about roaches everyone acts like they don't have them.
living in BK :| i needed this lol thankies  i want these dog sized beasts gone
Thank you so much! i needed this DIY desperately
I went to school in Baltimore & we had a big waterbug problem in our dorm. I once found one in my bed & they loved scaring us in the showers & when we were peeing lmao. My mom has to send my something to plug into the wall & it seemed go keep them away for awhile. Sucks living in fear of a roach or waterbug crawling on you though! Grosssss.
trust! i've tried everything! bombs, sprays, roach hotels, powder...they love the egg and sugar which is why they keep eating and they DIE!!! ANNIHILATION!!! VICTORY IS OURS!!!
I usually just spray them with a bug spray!
yes as @krenae said my hubby is Dominican :)
one time i was asleep and i felt something drop in the back of my bra. i ignored it because i was (k.o) but thennnn the next morninggggg!! when i woke up the next morning and i remembered, then i looked it was still therreeeee. ewwwwy!
i hope you're not using that bowl and fork ever again o_o
Her husband is....
lmaoo
LOL first off you are effin adorable and this is great advice, lived in NYC for a decade then left & now I'm coming back to NYC in a few months and I totally forgot about those damn "waterbugs" 0_o....I honestly didn't have a problem with them the same way as I did with mice which is like living in fear everyday of your life lol....thanks for this, now I will come prepared!
your so hilarious! and thank you i guess the seasonal change is what has these giant roaches in the house, the worst is seeing them in the bathtub but this should do the trick
Lmao! You're hilarious!
Are you Dominican?
I'm telling my bfs in NYC they need to do this they expect me to stay with them and they have roaches
"except from the rest of New York", I'm from France, I've travelled the world but never seen much more bugs than in New York!
I pray I don't have that problem when I move to nyc, but I'll be sure to keep this in mind if I do.. thanks, shameless!!!
I react the same way when I see any nasty ass type of bug! I like literally hyperventilate. It's horrible.
Nothing works like Dupont's Advion gel
Try 5 water bugs that flew in from the window consecutively in one night! EWWWWWW x(
it really works??..omg i was wondering why they weren't dying just from just putting the acid on the floor!
I LOVVEEE YOU! like my channel, if you get a chance!!!!
Ive NEVER be so excited for a how to video in my life!!! but i need this info to use on these bio engineered Florida roaches.
Ewwww but really informative.
