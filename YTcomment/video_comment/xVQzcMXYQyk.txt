I came across this video 6 years ago and I still use the recipe till this day!!!! ❤
Your presentation was excellent, clear and to the point. The avocado pit in the bowl to keep it from turning  was new to me.  Great tip.   I’m looking forward to trying the tomato sauce you used.  Thank you.
Delicious. Thank you!
You’re doing ok, but wrong knife and the one you are using is dull. Try a sharp 8” chefs knife. It will mow thru your ingredients quick. The blade you have just wears you out.
Good for you for blocking rude comments!!! i get a lot of those too and  it's like "Go make your own videos"  LOL!  We work so hard to try and  share our talents and recipes for people to chastise us.  I do the same,  block and don't have to deal with the negativity.   Mine is very  similar to yours except i use a purple onion, no Jalapeño, a shit ton of  lime lol and raw shrimmpers.  I'm going to give it a try with the Pato sauce.  Sounds interesting. Great video!!! Thank you!
“I don’t like the seeds” you mean you don’t like the spiciness 🌶
I love love ceviche thanks for sharing. 😋
Thank you!! I'm mixed and don't know how to make Mexican food 😭and moving to Alabama I've started to miss the food in El paso💔 this was so easy!!
I’m late and I still think you did a good job 🥰
Making this for dinner today it’s lent gonna make a awesome tostadas so excited 😆
4:45 pero q clase de ceviche es este? :v
Steak knife  is best
Idk the jalapeños seem like the dominican one i rather without it but yea i remember
Nice video!
Thanks for taking your time to show us your recipe. I picked up a few tips just looking at different recipes. I make ceviche myself and yours is very similar. I want to try the tomato sauce. Why do people have to be so critical. Even in Mexico nobody makes Mexican food the same it all about preference. Thanks again for sharing
Wrong knife to cut all vegetables?
I got to make this dish
C nnbbccdr_&£=°£
I'm so jealous! You can cut jalapeños with your bare hands! I have to use gloves or my fingers burn for days lol
Thankyou ❤️❤️❤️ as for tomatoes, you need a sharper knife. It's very easy to cut them if your knife is freshly sharpened.
i loooooove this it was soooo yummy its better most Mexican restaurants ceviche
Looks freaking amazing! I'm going to use frozen cooked chopped octopus instead of shrimp and see how it works out. Only thing I'm missing is cilantro 😐😞. Wish me luck...
Am I the only one who puts ketchup and tapitio in mine 😕
First off nice video presentation. Also u know the jalapenos without seeds isn't hot at all. I'm sure u know this. It looks delicious. Ha ha yes I saw the Corona lol wat no lime lol
the way my father would make ceviche he would use lots of limes to fill the large bowl with lime juice.
I love your knife
Who ever has her as a wife must fuck really good
Looks delicious 😋
did anyone else not see any lemon or lime go in ?
cut it in 4 from up top and take out the core . chop the outer layer so it doesn’t drowned out the lemon with the tomato juices
Nice
This video gives me life!! Thanks you for making this🤗😍😍
literally going to get everything now , thank you
Hey we as humans cook things differently!! Looks delicious 🤤 this is HER way if you don’t like it than take it upon yourself and do it differently. The whole point of cooking is having fun and incorporating your own style !!  ❤️❤️❤️ is eat this  !
Peep the corona🔥
It looks really good I will try it
Your kitchen sink area looks almost identical to the kitchen sink area in the apartment I live in. Literally the only difference is the color of the counters. Everything else is exactly the same, we even (usually) have our microwave in the same spot. (Had to move it b/c there's construction/re-piping scheduled)  Also, my sister makes ceviche sometimes and it's probably my favorite food now.
..... nice try, keep it up. Look at cooking videos and tips to learn more. Practice makes one learn. That’s how I learned 👍🏼
Yeah here's a comment you're kind of an idiot you're supposed to be cooking the shrimp with the lime juice and you basically put cook shrimp in
After the ceviche
More of a shrimp salad and i definitely want to try this way
ceviche is fish submerge in lemon juice
thats not even ceviche
Making this tonight
Hey Zang I do that too!
My grandma makes this and She chops the shrimps adds Clamato juice in it and then BOOM 狗哦哦大（good) in  chinese
love it,i like the cooked shrimp
That sharp knife made me nervous.
I like the recipe, very similar to mine. Just work on your knife skills and tuck those finger tips, so you dont lose a nail or cut a finger. 😁😉
Thank u for this. Looks really good.  Gonna try it tomorrow.
Wow looks amazing thanks for sharing.  I've made raw beef ceviche
Im sorry but this is not ceviche
This aint ceviche u know that right? All u need to add is some v8 and u have shrimp cocktail
I need to take out the seeds of the cucumber??
What happens to the lembons and limes.
Do you boil the shrimp first?
That is not  .Cebiche.it is cocktail de camarones.
Is ceviche salad ?
You stole this video this is not you making is ceviche I seen this video before with the audio
wanted to know if that is really true? about the avacado
oh my god look at all the people who think they are a fucking chef ramsey. home girl you did an awesome job looks so good fuck these haters.
This is NOT ceviche. This is more of a shrimp salad. Ceviche = marinating. The shrimp is cooked in lime not boiled.
That is not how ceviche is made I don't now where you are from this is different it's more like  shrimp cocktail
great recipe, place a wet paper towel under cutting to prevent it from sliding around
Flip the tomato upside down then cut them. Tomatoes are easier to cut from the flesh than it is from the skin. Try it. It works
I’ve never tried this dish but I’m dying too😱😩I hope it’s as delicious as it looks😍💯👌🏾
great video, thanks for sharing
Nice work...
I like this recipe can't wait to make it
The whole thing about the avocado not turning brown cause of the pit is just an old wives tale... lemon or lime will keep it from not turning brown
looks colorful and delicious.
This looks so fire , thanks for the video! Actually going to make some for my job's potluck. You need to make more cooking vids!!
That knife looks more like for filleting fish than for slicing and dicing, imo. Would recommend appropriate tool for task at hand. Not hating. Just suggesting. I'll have to try yer' "adding avocado pit-in-the-bowl trick to keep avocado from browning. Wouldn't the added citrus from lemon/ lime serve the same purpose? Thanks for sharing yer' recipe.
That’s looks amazingly delicious. Thanks so much for recipe & guidance. I’m for sure making it tonight. Yum, mouth watering. 👍
A little advice on keeping your cutting board from moving is to put a wet towel under
There are many ways to make ceviche, there is no one master recipe. Also I am Mexican, so depending what region you are from, ceviches are also done differently.
How do you cook the shrimp or are they precook ????
My kind of recipe. Simple! Thank you.
Came across ur video and thank you 🙏 easy and yummy thanks I made some last night  my husband loves it  thanks
Def going to try! Would be great for cookouts!
This video made me so hungry
the red onion is better for this. you just have to put in water with salt and let it rest for about 5 to 10 minutes and then rinse it. that process takes away the strong flavor of the onion. and after you should add the limes and a little bit of canola oil and salt. then you add it to the rest of the other stuff.. you should also remove the seeds from the cucumber and the tomatoes to avoid making you or anyone else gassy. I hope you don't mind my advice 😉
wtf, el pato sauce???? thats a sin !!
That is not ceviche, nor is that a shrimp cocktail. Your knife cuts are too big. And who the fuck puts a can of El Pato in a so called cocktail?! You must like that nasty ass can taste that needs to be cooked out. Please, actually take a cooking class and learn how to cook, yet alone how to properly use a knife.
I think you did a great job. Trying your recipe today.👍👍
You have to use a better knife. Try the chop and scoop from your set. That'll be easier with the tomatoes and onions.
Gross
Just buy small Roma tomatoes slices will be smaller
I just got done making this thank you so much I love it
Did u cook shrimp first? Its my 1st time making it but you make it look easy☺
looks delicious 😍
🅱️oi👋
Tip for cutting tomatoes make horizontal slices not vertical and the pieces will stay together for easier cutting as if you where gonna make slices for a burger then chop up.
Awesome it looks good !I was wondering if I could boil the shrimp instead since I dont have enough lemons to cook the shrimp.plus it saves time !:)
You’re gonna cut yourself if you don’t use a bear claw to protect your fingers
I read some comments and it seems people are hating on people who cook the shrimp..I boil them to give the shrimp some flavah then I marinate it in lime and you only leave the shrimp boiling for like one minute and that's it I'm talking about the fresh shrimp the black ones that once you cook turn orange and obviously I season the water with Saxon and cebolla and garlic just to give it some flavor and that's it
Great job , love your voice !!!
Sweet onion? I suggest you write down what you’re going to say
All the video is about peeling and cutting vegetables
how does the ball keep the avocado green??
Good job, looks very enticing!
I don't think I've ever been so concerned for someone else's fingers before. That knife looks viscous, lol. Great recipe, I can't wait to give it a try. Thank you.
How to cut tomatoes.  Step 1. Give to wife.   Step 2. Give wife shoulder rubs.
Did you boil the shrimp or cook it with lemon?
This is not ceviche. You should at least change the title or something so you don't end up misleading so many people. Then again, how else would you get your views?
She is not using raw shrimp y'all. That looks like frozen cooked shrimp. You can buy the bag already cook and frozen at the supermarket. You can also buy it cooked and not frozen at some supermarkets like Whole Foods. These are the small salad shrimp in the video. Those are good but I also like the medium shrimp for the Shrimp Ceviche. Great video but I can see why people got confused about the shrimp. DO NOT EAT RAW SHRIMP LOL. Make sure you buy it cooked.
iCook Knife?????
love the recipe 😆
that knife is a accident waiting to happen 😣
1 question do you cook the shrimp or do you just thaw it out
Very nice , you better use a sharp chef knife and the tomatoes will cut off like butter.
girl this is more of a botana rather than cevivhe.  first off ceviche is cooked in lime not fully cooked in water pre cooked.
A simple process it seems. I make it with raw fish and use lime juice to cook it.  Was the shrimp cooked?  I could not tell from thee video. Obviously this is an old video. RKW
the girl just wanted to share her recipe... why are on being a typical black woman with the arguing and nagging.... enjoy the video or find the recipe you are looking for.. let her live dude damn @prettymochame just T
Sis  thank you for showing me how to do this 😘
Looks delicious.
a 5 on a scale of 1-10
Tomatoes+Sharp Knife = Easy.
dope.  looks good.. I make it different but this way looks good too and easy.. thanks for the video
You blew my mind when you said to keep the avocado seed so that it doesn't turns brown
Is it possible to make ceviche without guacamole?
I have seen several types of ceviche recipes. What are the most basic ceviche ingredients and what proportions are recommended? How much freedom can you apply when choosing and trying ingredients?
I'm so excited to make ceviche now.  Thank you so much! this will be my first attempt and I can tell it's gonna be Amazing!! 😄😄😄 so thank you thank you!!
You forgot to mention the shrimps! But I see them in there.
I like how my mom makes it
get a better knife, my sug, lol
looks amazing
You go girl!!
I use a serrated knife to cut tomatoes 🍅
I didn't realize how easy was to make this dish... I have always bought from local safeway at $9.99 per lb! and yours looks SO much fresher and better! I guess if I add up the cost and ingredients it's probably the same, but your cerviche looks absolutely delicious! thank you!
Omg made my mouth water!! I just use imitation crab meat cut into chunks
cooked shrimp..........
awesome video g thanks for the recipe
tip for cutting tomatoes, sharp knife..very very sharp knife.
YUM!!! Looks good.
what if u dont have some of the ingredients?? will it still be good?
yass mama looks bomb
I really liked this recipe.  It's easy and looks really tasty.  Do you ever put fish in your ceviche? does that change the flavor in your opinion?
Looks so good! Cravable food!! 😋😋
Wait what is the regular onion 😆😆❤❤
looks good! but i think is more like a shrimp cocktail, ceviche is raw fish, thanl you!
great! i have an asian neice that adds more thAN just that red sauce,lemon n Salt! lol.. aint that sum ... 😧 anyways. ur video was great no disrespect. thought u would add MORE THAN THAT! lol. like maybe clamato juice... to it. very interesting! i guess everyone makes it their own way!
Wow this looks so delicious and presentation is so pretty. My Co worker made this dish and instead of avocado he put mango and it was yummy. Thanks for sharing 👍
Tomato?
I just made this thank you for the awesome video I also added a little Tapatio and it came out great but I didn't know about the El Pato tomato sauce which is very enlightening
very bomb recipe tho my whole fam loves it
That's nasty😝😛
Fisherman and surfer myself....great job looks awesome! Try to do it with fish sometime. Cobia ceviche is my favorite :)
Thank you for the video and I love the bottle of Corona in the background while you are miking the ingredients - two thumbs up!
I tried this it was awesome!!!! thanks
The Geico Caveman brought me here lol. Looks delicious!
Love ceviche
IS the shrimp cooked?
Looks great I have never used tomato sauce in Crevice before.
The seeds of the Jalapeño contain most of its spiciness, but it also contains most of its vitamin C. A single Jalapeño can contain as much vitamin C as three oranges, so your kinda missing out. (Vitamin C is good for your immune system)
Why are these mexicans making ceviche? Make your tacos and leave our south american foods alone.
Why the Mexican pronunciation? Edit your videos to make them watchable.
you did a great job...
yeah to hell with rude people. oh and a tomato chopper. one chop and its done :)
I had this at Mi Terria's Mexican restaurateur the other night for the first time and thought it was so good! Great job I will be stealing your recipe! Thank you.
Great video I have a question do you cook your shrimp or boil them in water ?
looked great but did I miss the lemon juice to cook the shrimp.
Did you cook the shrimp?
Eye yie yie mamii this looks deliciousoso
If you cut your half tomato in half again in the same manner from the bottom almost all the way through to the stem area but don't completely deports the last bit of skin and then continue the way you normally cut with a knife with teeth, I found is the best method for me personally so far. Teeth make a HUGE difference when it comes to cutting almost everything, for me. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe! My husband is going to love this! He is new to the pescetarian diet and he's finding it hard to adjust but this will def help!
Looks amazing. I'm Jamaican so I might use a scotch bonnet pepper for more spice. I'm gonna try it today it looks amazing
Nice job,I love your version!
should put some beer in. looks good
buy canned chopped tomatoes ;)
beautiful good job!!!
This made my mouth water!! I'm making shrimp ceviche for 4th of July side dish. Did you cook/boil the shrimp before you added it?  I scrolled to see if you already answered that question but I didn't see it. Thanks!!🍅🌶
im so going too.make this for my man good job
saved this to make later today. loved how simple and beautiful it looked. thanks!!!
switch the Shrimp with fish (chavela) is better :D
Should of cut the shrimp a little, but it looked good tho
Omg all of you are a bunch of cry babies! It's. A different version and a good fix if you're on a time crunch. Smh. I'm sure Italian spaghetti is very different than how we eat it in the U.S. I don't hear Cambodians, Vietnamese, or Thai arguing over whose pho noodle version is better. As long as it tastes good! I'm sure if it's served to you, you wouldn't have known the difference if she had "cooked" raw shrimp from the citrus acids.
great shrimp cocktail. still waiting on that ceviche!
And as for those arrogant jerks who think they know how to make it best, just look who got so many likes! Make your own video if you know so much. This is hers and she did a kick ass job!
This is fabulous! My brother is going to be in seventh heaven when I make this for him! You did such a great job demonstrating it, too.
Very nice Sweetheart  :)
I use one made by Henckles? Spelling... it's the rugged edge that makes it so easy to use. BTW ! I'm making your recipe right now ! Can't wait to try it.
As for how to cut a tomato... use a tomato knife.  MUCH easier.
Thank you.. Different from how I've had this..  But looks so yummy.. & DO - ABLE 😎🤗👌
Thank you for this video i am going to make this today =)
Hell yes
try using Roma Tomatoes, then cut and seed them the same way u did the jalapeños.. I do this with the cucumber too.
How did u cook the shrimp ?
Your techniques are easy. Great Job!! Where did you get that knife. I want one like that one.
Yummmm looks so good. I grew up with my grandma and mom boiling the shrimp instead of cooking it raw in the lemon and idc if anyone's disagrees with that. It's delicious! We also add some shredded crab meat. Soo good
that corona looks good
I have no problem with this ! It looks amazing ! I think I need a corona too !! Lol
I'm gonna make this. I use to work at a Hispanic restaurant and this thing tasted so good.
se ve bueno pero es cocktail de camaron no?
I thought ceviche was only fish
nice job!
Were those shrimp raw or cooked? I hear that it's not a traditional ceviche if you do not use raw shrimp and allow the acid from the juice of a lemon or a lime to cook the shrimp. Also, when you are cutting the tomatoes or the onions, after you've cut them in half, hold them half side up in your hand and dice them in the same manner that you diced the avocado just not as deep and go layer by layer and then shave across with one cut then start the next layer . Bigger or smaller is up to. The only other easy way to do it is to just slice round slices like the ones you would put on a sandwich and then lay the slices flat on the cutting board and cross cut them that way.
love the video
shrimp cocktail ceviche damn near the same
that's  not ceviche. Are you Loca can of tomato ??? what??
nice. thank you.
Cut the top off the tomato,  then slice it in half from the top down. cut it again to make quarters. Over a sink or trash can, use your fingers to scoop out seeds. Then with skin side down, fillet the tomato like you would a fish to get rid of the inner whitish parts, almost like a bell pepper. Cut your now flat tomato segments into strips and dice! Also, a chef's knife would really be your best friend in the kitchen. They look big and scary but the added weight will make your cuts a lot easier. LLAP <3
was that cooked shrimp?
how many limes you use?
The key to cutting tomatoes is a razor sharp knife. It's worth the money to invest in a good knife (not a cutco) as long as you can maintain it. Recently got my GF a Shun chef's knife, honer, and block for around $150 off Amazon. A bit pricey but it cuts like a dream.
i cut tomatoes upside down lol it works for me
Instead of tomato juice, try a few dashes of Worshestershire...but not too much or will taste like steak  sauce.
Picky on this...picky on that...ggeezzussss :) great video tho
I'm def going to have to try this =D YUM!
Me too.  I hate cutting tomatoes.  You are good at it.  Mine never come out as pretty as yours.
girl you did good. i hate seeing great videos get bashed so i am telling you it looks good and im sure it tastes good too.
you need a Cutco trimmer knife. you will love it!
Great job ! Thanks !
if you use clamato it is no longer ceviche ppl it is shrimp cocktail...the raw shrimp has to sit in the lime or limon juice until its cooked by the acid in the juice
I CANT STAND THE WAY YOU CUT AVOCADO THAT'S THE WRONG WAY!
woah w8 those shrimps are pretty small compared to mexican ones and they need to be the best in this dish.
yikes.. tomatoe sauce? it just ruined the recipe...
Thank you so much...it is a pleasure to watch your video, you are concentrated on the dish and I like that a lot. Looks very yummy I will try it for Christmas
Nice and easy! Thanks:)
Making my mouth water. That looks so good
thank you 👌👌👌 looks bomb
What a horrible way of making seviche. so sad ×(
thats a "COCTEL DE CAMARON" NOT CEVICHE LOL ..... PEOPLE THESE DAYS ......
As promised:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv92ILCUUhU  Please excuse my mistakes!
can u use precooked shrimp
i learned how to make ceviche with this video 2 years ago! I've made it for family and friends, and they love it.  but i use clamato and lime instead. And i also add mango. Thanks !!! P.S. I'm asian!!!(:
That knife looks kinda scary but great knife skills. :-)
Love this video and especially that you used a sweet onion.  I will never be able to eat a white or yellow onion after discovering sweet onions. So glad I stumbled upon your channel.. Long live food porn! :-)
I love adding mango to my ceviche. Adds just enough sweetness with the spicy.... Sooo yummy😀
That's a good one, do you have any other recipe videos ?
Some people are so damn rude on here. I think you did a great job. Thanks I loved how it came out . 😘
how long will the left overs keep in fridge?
nice tip on leaving the avocado pit in the bowl
this is not ceviche, but more of a ceviche "style". ceviche refers to how the shrimp or fish is cooked, which is by the acid of lemon, limes and/or orange.
I add clamato instead of that sauce you used and lemon juice its the best!!!
Thank you ! Nicely done
More recipes please <3
Just made this recipe and it came out amazing! For tomatoes, I like to cut the top off and then sit the tomato bottom down. I then slice it almost to the bottom, but leaving a bit so it stays connected. Then cut perpendicularly the same way. After that, set the tomato on its side and slice down all the way through, you should get a perfect dice!
Hey Dezzzv_ Just wanted to let you know that the type of knife you are using is not the right type for cutting tomatoes, try using a straight blade that is very sharp. It makes a world of a difference. Thanks for the recipe BTW!
How did you cook your shrimp? In lime juice? Did you boil them?
Thanks can't wait to make it will let you how it goes
awesome! loved your presentation
cut the tomatoes in slices as if you were going to put them on a sandwich, then stack them two or three high and cut into strips, turn 90 degrees and cut again. perfect dice
Fuck leave her alone shrimp cocktail? Tomatoe tomato. That's ceviche to me. Thumbs up!
I'm not hating or anything but when making ceviche, the shrimp needs to be raw the lemon/lime cooks it with the acid it has no need to boil the shrimp, the shrimp marinate in the lime juice raw
do you have to leave the shrimp in a bowel with lemon over night i read that on a recipe somewhere
I don't know how to cut tomatoes either.....
this is not ceviche is shrimp cocktail lol js
Use a sharp serrated knife for tomatoes.
lool... That's a fillet knife for filleting... Good recipes tho :)
I have to try this next time looks good.
My bf's mom taught me how to make ceviche now she doesn't have to dread cooking it for him because I can actually make it for them both :)
Thanks for making ceviche alot simpler! I made a ceviche last Christmas from a recipe online and it took me 6 hours in the kitchen! ay dios mio  NO! haha, and my mom used to do the same thing you did with your daughter, with enchiladas rojas and tamales picantes and carne con chile she would leave out a bit for me without the spicyness until i was older. gracias!
I have never had ceviche before. I want to try this now. Looks really good and your video was well put together. Thanks for sharing.
All natural sea salt and black pepper
Knife no good
At first I was like why am I watching this chick cut everything in such a bad way and omitting so many things that she doesnt like and not using proper technique and all that?  Then I realized ok she's an amateur. Like me in the kitchen. If she can make this I can too. So i did :) But I didn't add cucumber, more cilantro, sriracha, and ketchup and mayo :D
Nice video..... I will be trying out the recipe, looks simple enough.
All the negative comments about this recipe are from Peruvinas; they think that they own the secret recipe for the most delicious cebiche in the world. It turns out that the Peruvian cebiche recipe is so simple even a 7 year old can prepare it and the “Peruvian salt” is no other that MSG called Ajinomoto in Peru.
Prior to making the dish, do you cook the shrimp?
Prior to making the dish, do you cook the shrimp?
Its better when you use clamato picante just saying ..
This is not ceviche, she just made a Shrimp Cocktail Mexican style
May I suggest adding imitation crab meat and instead of putting the avocado in the ceviche keep it on the side, therefore, it wont get mushed. I will be adding a vid of my ceviche soon.
wow its so easy. its like an advanced salad!!! so simple >_<.  thank!
That's cocktail de camaron

Me encanto tu receta se ve auténtica además de fácil, simple y delicioso en 1, 2 por 3! Gracias por indicar los ingredientes!
Are the shrimps raw?
Avocado pits don't do all that much to prevent guac from browning because all it does is stop the air from reacting to the chemicals in the broken plant cells. You might as well wrap flush with plastic and it'll block a larger amount of surface area from air. NO MAGIC! Just science..
Thats not the way to make ceviche at all
this looks so yummy!
When doing ceviche the "vialia chop wizard" an as seen on tv product dices everything in about 3 minutes and every piece is the same size.....try it, the only tears you'll be shedding are tears of joy!
PPPLLLLLEEEEEAASSSSEEE SOMEONE TELL ME IF I HAVE TO COOK THE SHRIMP
Thanks for your shrimp recipe it was fun and good
No offence but that is just really a shrimp salad. As with real ceviche the fish/shrimp is marinated in the lemon or lime juice. Looks nice though :-)
WOW This Recipe Rocks!!!...If U Added Clamato Would it be a Shrimp Cocktail Like They Have Off of The Seafood Catering Trucks in Cali???.......
Just had the curiosity & taste for crevice, checked internet, yours came up first, going to see how it turns out this. weekend making it the first time.  VIVA, VIVA !
This vid was pretty cool, thanks for showing it. Usually I put 2 dashes of Mrs. Dash lemon-pepper in it which gives a nice flavor, and as well keeps the avocado from going brown.
I use a bread knife to cut tomatoes...technically the lemon juice will not make the avocado turn brown...but other than that..looks good
Wish i could see your face , you sound hot. Thanks for the recipe.
mmmm, i loved it
i Lite myspace ceviche Smith tapatío
YOU COULD FIND EL PATO IN MEXICO
THE BALL FROM THE AVOCADO DOESNT TASTE GOOD  :{
when do u put the corona in....get a onion chopper cuts everything rapido [QUICK]
omg It looks soo good and easy to make ...surprising my hubby with this tonigh!! thank you
THIS WAS THE PERFECT VIDEO I NEEDED. IM MAKEIN CEVICHE FOR DINNER TODAY AND MY 8YR SON FOUND YOUR VIDEO AND HE WANTS ME TO MAKE IT LIKE YOURS LOL GOOD RECIPIE. THANK YOU
Thank you for showing this :) I couldn't find the perfect way to make ceviche and I really don't like asking my cousin and you did a wonderful job.
Oh and you can also make it with red snapper just cut in pieces and let it cook in lemon and lime so good.
You don't put el pato on ceviche but I guess you can make it anyway you want.  All I put on mine is the shrimp,tomatoes ,onion, cilantro catchup and lemons and I serve it on tostadas.  And everyone loves it I haven't heard one complaint yet.
I use to put avocado but I stopped because it would get black, believe me.  If you put it it's better to eat it the same day.
My mouth is watering. You made look very easy and  I am diying to try your recipe. Thank you so much.
You don't put EL PATO you put CLAMATO....
I have never heard of putting tomato sauce
perfect ! looks really good .thanks for sharing
Please someone tell this lady that this is not ceviche. At best is a mexican shrimp cocktail. I know ceviche is popular now but the original recipe is from Peru. If anyone makes a copy , it must be stated that this is not the original ceviche. If anyone has never tried ceviche please skip the video and look at this link:    http://youtu.be/bdaqjBCabHw
Lookz  Good 😋
Fish is best unless its cocktail.
Looks like salad with shrimp. That's not ceviche
Thanks the video but i had high anxiety watching you use the knife.  Please "knuckle" when you chop.
Walmart in the mexican food section.. :) hope this helped!
Where can I find a can of El Pato?
Is the shrimp raw?
Tgis totally wrong u should have the talapia for the ceviche chopped already annd add always the onion and limon first so the damn talapia cooks like that   dunbass.
Thank u for sharing this ... ceviche got expensive so I want to learn to make it myself :-)

best way to cut tomatos is to have a sharp knife lol, so have a knife sharpener or invest in a ceramic knife

I prefer Clamato with ceviche

Tip;;;   Use a better knife.  Sharpen the good one you get properly. Dont know where you got that funky blade but.... geeze what a weird thing that is. Try Henkle knives. Use a stone to sharpen. Learn how first.
damn that looks good, thanks for giving me some ideas
I thought you gonna put some beer in there...
use a knife designed for tomatos or a bread knife works really well the serrated edge will help cut through it easily with out using a lot of pressure and then a santouko to dice
u have a sexy voice
How did u cook the shrimp
Thanks Dez, good food video....
Thanks for sharing. My friend makes it this way too. I will try tonight. Ps.. you cut up that tomato just like I do.  :D
TOMATO cutting tip.  1st. buy a romma tomato there are smaller and will have less waist.  2nd remove the pith and the seeds it is how you would cut tomatos for like pico or salsa for presentation you don't want seeds or the pith.  when you do that they are much easier to cut like a thick juicy pepper just some info try it you will like it.
cut the top off of the tomato and slice not all the way through like your slicing for a sandwhich then do it the other way then cut through alot easier hope it helped
can you use crab instead of shrimp?
I like tipia ceviche bettter
Thank you so much for the recepie I tried making it before and it didn't taste good but when I added the salsa del pato ahhh man it really made a difference. My husband and I are really thankful for your recepie
Sorry, that was not ceviche but a shrimp cocktail! The shrimp was not raw but precooked and you did not cook it with any citrus. I'm sure it tasted good though.
Best way to cut tomatoes is to use a serrated blade.
Interesting use of the avocado pit. I had never heard of that before.
looks good im going to try it today!!! had a taste for some!! Thanks for posting it!!
Thank you. Dig the video. It's super easy to follow. Please make more. Beginner cook here :)
Oh yea ceviche with a corona perfect
Hi young lady, I really enjoyed your video, keep making them but it's not a ceviche and what you're making it seems more like a shrimp cocktail which looks absolutely delicious by the way. Keep posting recipes have a blessed day
Can you make one for Carnitas Pibil? please?
What kind of knife is that ?!?!
thank you! :)
Thank you!!!! I've always wanted to learn and your video is great!!!!!
Your shrimp definitely looks cooked in this vid.  Also leaving shrimp in the citrus for too long can over cook the shrimp.  You would be better off mixing everything except the shrimp and then adding the shrimp a couple of hours before serving.
raw
the shrimp you used, was it cooked or raw.
:) will do!
More cooking videos please! ^_^
yes its okay to make a day before eating it. it might actually taste better because it will all marinate and have more time for the shrimp to soak up all the flavor. The cilantro will be fine, not soggy. :) sorry i took so long to get back to you. let me know how it comes out!!! :)
Can we prepare ceviche a day before. Cause I was afraid about the cilantro being soggy the nxt morning ?? PLEASE help. I'm making a shrimp and imitation crab ceviche. Is tht also ok to put in a day before or will it go bad. First timer.
no problem, Thank you for watching!!! :)
Lol, thanks.
thank you!
Talofa Dez R... thank you for the video.
looks bomb but I prefer Clamato in mine... She sounds hot btw =D
I dont cook the shrimp, I get it straight from the meat & Seafood dept. and clean it when i bring it home and them add it to the mixture.
Eh Esa, Made this over the weekend turned out bomb. Washed down real good with a Corona. Ha ha ha. Just wanted to also let some of your subs that read the comments know that if they don't have El Patos tomato sauce in the house that Clamato juice will work too. So glad I tried it and big props to you again for this video.
Great recipe! Can't wait to try it! Question did you use the shrimp that is boiled already? From the store or did u boil it?
Thank you so much, it really does mean a lot to me to get awesome feedback like that!  please stay tuned for more food videos!!! :) thank you again!
Thank you, glad you enjoyed!
i dont know? it jus does... if you cut an avocado and throw out the pit out you'll notice the avocado turn brown quicker then it would if you would have left the pit in it. :) i was jus taught this by family. feel free to google it, lol i did!
Eh girl that video was great. Man that looked so good. Loved the way you did this video you made it look so easy and your knife skills are darn good too. Big cyber hug for sharing such a wonderful dish. If you have anymore please share. Loved how you had a Corona in the final picture. I am sure Corona is going to love you for the marketing. Plus, I bet whoever makes this dish ends up buy Corona too. LOL! Again great job hon.
This was delicious and easy to follow, I made it for my family and they loved it!! :)
what does the avocado pit being in the bowl have to do with it remaining green?
thank you! & yes!
thank you :)
