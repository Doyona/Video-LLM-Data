I am about to pull some peanut butter short bread raspberry bars out. I used yours and another persons recipe. I hope there as good as I imagine. Thanks for all your lessons.
These are fabulous! made some for the kids to take for their school snack. i accidently weighed the jam and used 225 grams instead of 300 gms, but it worked out fine!
The longer I watch this, the more I love you 😂😂 sounds like a normal person explaining cooking and not a chef. It’s like my funny aunt I love is teaching me baking because everyone knows aunties and moms produce the best tasting cooking
It was delicious. Thank you. Blessings 💗💖💗💖
Thank you 💕💕
I made these the other day and they were delicious and very easy to do.
I made this last week with rasberry jam i made from your recipe too. Only had half of the jam left so i made half the recipe! OMG, so good, husband ate all in 24hours Lol! So good!
This recipe is absolutely amazing!!  ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you so much sister Very nice sweet😋
Stephanie... how much is exactly a cup of flour... is it 120 g or 130 g...? 🤔  Google says 1 cup is 120 g.. and in this recipes  I find them as 130g..
Costco’s raspberry crumble cookies brought me here cuz I don’t wanna stand in line to get them. 🤣😁
Can we use Nutella instead of the jam ?
Can i use frozen raspberry alone, or do i have to make raspberry sause ?
Thak you Stephanie, your recipes  look so good . I started baking your recipes.
My colleagues were very happy today that I made this. Delicious!
It would be so much easier if America would get on the metric bandwagon.  BTW I'm American. :P
I love freezer jam yummy
can I substitute the Razpberry Jam for Strawberry instead?
Magnificent, just made a batch😇 Great detailed instructions, measurements and heat conversations so useful. Thank you for sharing. Have Subscribed to your channel, please subscribe to mine if possible. Happy baking.
Dear Stephanie, I have been watching your videos for a while but only got into baking recently love your recipes and the detailed measurements you give. I had a question, I only have 8 inch pans both round and square, does that affect my project? be it a bake, or something like this?
I love how you offer all measurement for those using the metric system.  I'm in the US, but I know they must appreciate your recipes/videos as you are mindful of their system!  Cant wait to make these!!
I don't like raspberries can you use apricots or peaches instead?
My very favourite, my mouth is watering xx
My favorate
I made these today and they turned out well problem is can't stop eatting them lol tfs
You are the best!
making it right now :)
My gran used to make this with currants and called it 'Fly Cemetery'. They were delicious. I think I'll try it with your recipe for the shortbread. :)
Made one of these yesterday, turned out really nice, Thanks to Joy Of Baking and Stephanie for this very instructive recipe demonstration. I never had a square tin handy for the baking but used a circular 9 inch flan dish instead, turned out just the same but different shape obviously, will bake again but using home made Jam--thank you all.
Just wanted to say, thank you Stephanie, it's been 5 years since I've been baking your recipes, I've grown in my baking skills and a lot has to do with you being a great teacher :)
i made this and it amazing. just i haven't raspberry i replace with blackberry but its taste really so soft and crispy  thank you Stephanie
Can u make jello cake pls?
Happy Easter to you and your family! 🐣🕊️🐇

Thank you dear for your Golden  Hands
Sorry was a typo on 100k I also meant 1million
dear stephanie i love your videos i am curious how you clean this square pan like how come it never has the little bits in the corners i dont know how you do it please tell me the ways of the pan thanks
You are amazing 😍😍😍😍
I always wondered why you don't weigh 500 pounds? Boy does that short bread look good. I have to give this a try. Thanks for this Steph!
I don't have any raspberry jam but I just finished making a batch of Kumquat Curd. What do you think of using a curd as the fruit jam layer?
Woow.just baked it for my baby .its just sooooo delicious. I didnt have raspberry at home so used peach. Eat most of it didnt left alot for my baby..Lol. thanks so mush for all videos.
The shortbread looks delicious.i'm going to try them soon 😋😋

Looks yummy but u didn’t indicated at how many  •c
Hi this does look easy I’m going to try it definitely for Easter now//Happy Easter 🐣 love all your videos👍👍👍❤️❤️
I came across this channel about 5 hours ago and trust me I love everything about your channel.my name is Dorcas,please I will like to talk to you in private.this is my email address dorcasowiah@gmail.com or dorcasowen77@gmail.com ,and thank you for all the great videos
So yummy looking 👍🏽😋
Already wondering what will you bake when you reach 1 million
Let me ask you a question. My flour states 30 grams per 1/4 cup so 240 g for 2 cups.  Do flours vary that much? I went add and used the measure that my brand stated. Sure hop it will not be messed up! 😳
These look great....I will be making them very soon 😀
I’ve been searching for a good, easy base shortbread recipe & I think this fits the bill. I can see using this shortbread to make all kinds of recipe variations, especially w/chocolate, as well as using it alone to make plain shortbread squares, etc. I make a lot of your recipes & they’re always perfect! I’ve discovered many YouTube recipes that don’t work as written, (even from the famous cooks), but yours always do. I never have to alter cooking time/temp or measurements. So thank you so very much for being such an excellent cook & equally excellent teacher!
I will be making these today with strawberry jam🍓! Thank you! 😁
Thanks
Looks delicious!
awesome bars recipe
Wonderful my dear
If I want to use cherry does it need to be jam? Or can I reduce some frozen cherries on the stove top with a bit of sugar?
I don't know about anyone else but finding a 9x9 square pan, at least in stores, is near impossible!  All I can find is a 9" round or 8x8 square. Any suggestions?  Thank you.
These raspberry shortbread bars look fantastic Stephanie, thank you for the recipe I’ll be making them soon. Happy Easter to you and the family.
Yummy. I will be making them today.
Looks very good.  Your outro of "Until next time, I'm Stephanie Jaworski ..." makes it sound like next time you won't be.  Weird abstract observation.  I look forward to your uploads every Thursday morning.
very nice and yummy thanks
Making these today! Thank you.
Nice
Good luck Chef.
Really WOW.
Hi there.
