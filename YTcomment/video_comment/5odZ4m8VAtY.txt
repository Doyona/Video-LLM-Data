Hi Bold Bakers!  Learn how to make praline candy today so you can get ready for my all-new Fudge flavors this Thursday! Get the WRITTEN RECIPE: http://bit.ly/PralineHowTo
In America, what she made is not called Praline, it’s called PEANUT BRITTLE, no matter what type of nut you use. A PRALINE is made with an almost fudge texture, with nuts of your choosing. It’s a smooth rich almost a creamy but somewhat hard texture. Its not hard like Peanut Brittle at all.  If I am wrong, then please forgive me. And enjoy your lives ON PURPOSE 🤗🕊️🙏❤️
At wt temp on candy thermometer we should add almonds?
we call it chikki in our country ..and we have similar candy known as gajjak that is made out of jaggery and nuts instead of granulated sugar which more on the smoother side ...
Made it four times, actually, tried to make. Fail every time. First time, in my opinion, there are too much almonds. Once I added them to the sauce, the sauce just stuck and I could not pour it. The second time, I got great color, and once I added butter, room temperature, the mixture became sand like. Same the third time, and fourt time it was a mess straight from the beginning
For something like a caramel would it be better to use castor sugar since it’ll dissolve easier? And do you have a tip or hack to make castor sugar out of regular granulated sugar?
is it pronounced Pray Leen?
Almond + Sugar = Praline?
Thank you for sharing with us. I would like to know if I can do this recipe using honey instead of sugar. What do you think?
Shelf life of praline
In India, praline would be referred to as 'chikki'.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikki
What can I do if the caramel won't harden ?
How much sugar n how much is little water n how much butter
Thanks Alot I will add this to my chocolate Cake for My Mother's Birthday 😊
Idk what I did wrong but my praline tastes bitterrrr
Hi
In india if we keep it outside the fridge i think it would melt and become sticky... why does it become soft if kept in fridge?
I tried this recipe and I think it is excellent. I added so sea salt for a different flavour dimension!
Pleasse make praline and cream ice-cream...
Sounds and looks like brittle  the pralines I have in Texas are fat and they're soft and the rich tasting they're not hard and crunchy
When I look at your face  I realises how kind and sweet u r ,love your channel 💖💗🥰
I've tried this.. looked exactly like yourz until I added butter and nuts. At this point it crystallized:(

Ur detailed explanations r vry helpful. Thank u so much mam.
Hello.  Here in the Philippines,  we make and call it peanut brittle because we use peanuts instead of almonds.  In the Bicol region where our Miss Universe Catriona Gray was born,  bicolanos use their native pili nuts to make delicious products similar to praline.
its pronounced "pray leens"
In Kerala, we make it with peanuts and is called kadala mittai
This is a popular street snack in Ghana called Nkate cake, nkate means groundnuts / peanuts, there is also one made from dried coconut as well
In Pakistan it is called "gachac" my mom make these with peanut or sesom seed and I love this especially the one which my mother makes
Do you have a microwave peanut or nut brittle recipe?
can you explain differences between nougatine and praline. i think its the same thing but not pretty sure
Here in Saudi Arabia we make it with a lot of sesame and we call it "Semsemeyya" funny name huh? 😁😀
Can we use Jaggery rather than sugar???
Simple and great recipe!!! I tried it with peanuts ,my favourite!!! Worked well with it toooo
hi gemma  your candy looks delicious and yum and i love this  please learn how to make molsses
I know something similar to this can  you try and make peanut butter oatmeal candy
Omg you never know how much I miss your recipes Gemma I was so busy with my exams... gonna try those😍👌🏻...keep it up
I loved this recipe♡♡
Hello Gemma, i am ur subscriber from India. I love watching you videos and love making some recipes from them. I have one request for a recipe - please make a peanut butter muffins. I really wanna recipe from ur side. Lots of love
Can you carmalize Splenda like sugar and make this praline candy ?
Easy to Veganise this one.
Yuummm!!! This praline added to vanilla ice cream will definitely make it over the top. Thank you so much Gemma I love it 💛💛💛
I love this!! In Italy we have a lot of different "Praline Candies", made with different kinds of nuts and flavored in diferent ways! There is one made with almonds, flavored with lemon zest and served over lemon leaves...it's amazing! Thanks for this basic recipe, Gemma 💕
This is called 'chikki' in India, but it has peanuts instead of almonds and it is made with melted jaggery instead of caramel and it tastes delicious!
Hey Gemma, some of my coursemates and I are planning to have a Christmas potluck and I had the idea for a gingerbread cheesecake that sounds right up your alley, think you can do it?
We have something similar in Egypt, we call it  "Moleed sweets" we eat it around this time of year when we celebrate prophet's day
Show us how to make perfect brioche!! Im a Culinary student and till now I did 2 times brioche and ended up with rough balls..so please do it!! Thanks in advance!!
Hi Gemma! Just watched this video...oh!!! so yum...my bro just loves these...i wish i visit him soon and make these for him...Thanks Gemma 💕
Wow! Half of the comments are about the resemblance of praline candy and Indian chikki. I had no idea you have so many indian followers Gemma :) Please make microwave versions of Indian recepies now, I can assure you that would add more subscribers to your already multiplying subscription list!! Eagerly waiting for your quick and easy recepies 😃😃
Ooh, that looks so good! I definitely want to make some. Thank you!
Hi gemma. Can you please make a video on how to store cakes??
is there a difference between Praline and "brittle" I.E. peanut brittle?
Indonesia have this too but it changes almond for peanute and sugar for palm sugar
I love your videos Gemma! It helps me cope with sadness and always lightens up my mood! You really are a rare gem!
That looks so delicious!  I am going to have to try this!  I know I wil lhave to work on the patience part waiting on the sugar to turn that amber color!
Could I vacuum store it? To make it last longer and be sure that it doesn't come in contact with humidity
Its called gachak too And here it is made with peanuts But i will definitely try this almond one😍
Yummy. I would call this almond brittle.  Like Lisa Huther said, "Pralines are made with brown sugar, cream, and pecans and are usually dropped out on wax or parchment paper. Pralines are thick and much softer than brittle. " But whatever you call it, it is delicious. :D Update: I stand corrected, in the Southern United States pralines are as described above.  It seems that what we call brittle is called praline in other places in the world. :)
I made it with jaggery along with all the nutty dry fruits...best energy bars for breakfast.
Sab chikki wale bethy hain yahan ....ek main bhi 😂
i gave it a like!
YUM!
This is almond brittle. Pralines aren’t hard like this.
In Texas we call that brittle, our pralines are soft and chewy. And we pronounce praline as pra(y)line.
Thanks Gemma  !! Such a good idea as a gift at christmas time, too, to put among some cookies.. Great, I will try it soon..
hi gemma, i realy njoy ur cooking... plz share the cooking dough
so good
In Philippines, we call this peanut brittle, since we use peanuts instead of almonds. ☺
That looks really good. It would be amazing on ice cream.
That was easy thank you 😘😘☺️😍☺️
In the Us. At hard crack, we call that "Brittle" not praline. To me, I've always seen pralines as stiff chewy caramel with nuts.
I live in LA but come from India. In South India we call it pallipatti and use peanuts.
My 2 and 4 year old LOVE watching "Gemma videos" with me. Today while watching this one, my 2 year old was asking to see Gemma make an apple dutch baby pancake 😄 Have I somehow missed it, or is it not one you've done yet?
I love your videos So basic , easy and delicious  I like salted peanuts praline
I jus love how ez u make tings for us ,thanku
This is great! I was actually planning to give this with more yummy treats to some friends! I'm all about edible gifts😁
That’s more like brittle as in peanut brittle I make my pralines with light brown sugar butter and evaporated milk with roasted pecans.
So easy.  Love it as always.
I love praline
Gemma can i incorporate praline into like a chocolate salami or do you think that t He caramel ones it sets it’s to hard and it would be to crunchy for chocolate salami, I wanted to give the chocolate salami praline flavor I was thinking dough with white chocolate
This is more like a brittle. Our pralines are more like a fudge consistency
I love your recipe. . can I I add baking soda initially when the sugar is all of that golden Amber stage with the butter because that is how I remember my mother made?
Hi Gemma! This Praline is AWESOME!  Did you think about the Creme fraiche? Could be a bold basics recipes. :D
Happy Sunday Gemma. Thanks for another great video. Will definitely add this to the peanut brittle I'm making for gifts
Hi Gemma can i add whole almond???thank you for the recipe  <3
it looks very tasty Gemma! can we put margarine instead of butter or just make it without butter? thank you💟
Isn't this more of a brittle than a praline or is it just how it's made in other countries? In Louisiana we use cream not water.
Hi Gemma 😊 Yes, this is so good and quickly done. Here in Italy we call it "Croccante". Bye Gemma😍😚
Pecan Praline is my favorite ice cream flavor. Maybe you can use this and make that flavor for your next ice cream video! I tried making pralines when I was about 13. It was a think gritty mess 😂😂  You dropped the candy like you would with cookie dough instead of in one sheet. I suppose at 30 it's time to give it another try! Thanks for sharing 💜
Dearest Gemma, thanks always for the lovely lessons and goodies;-) wishing you and yours the best Holidays , love ,  light , blessings!
Praline N' Nuts Two Machine Ice Cream!
In India, we call it Chikki. Traditionally peanuts are used to make it, but now people use different combinations of nuts to make different varieties and also sometimes jaggery is used instead of sugar for different taste.
Crushed praline in home made ice cream, yummy.
i seriously want you to try indian food
Gemma have you made what folks in the southern US call pralines made with pecans?
Wow I love it thanks you godblessyou mmmmwwwaaaa
Hi Gemma, it might be a stupid question but can you make it with sesame too?
Yummy
I love you Gemma but no. That isn’t Praline candy at least by a New Orleans  way of making it.
Gemma i like ur recipes as always but its too long u don't make mug meal plz make a new vedio on mug meals.i m big fan of ur mug recipes
Do you need a stainless steel sauce pan or will a nonstick sauce pan work?
Anything with any nuts is amazing😁looks delicious
Hey Gemma!  If you wanna have chikki in India, then make sure that you come during winters cause that's the time when they are enjoyed in here!!  Lots of love💞💞🇮🇳
This is very famous in Pakistan and India. Being called as Gachak and chikki respectively ❤ yaaay gemma ❤
This looks delicious but it does look more like a brittle.
Is there a sub for the butter. Looking to make something like this for someone with dairy allergy
I have been upset today and this has made my thoughts been better
Hi Gemma again great recipe thanks
Gemma your on Nailed It
CHIKKI 😂😂
These are winter special chikki or brittles that are of different catagories here sesemi,peanut mainly...basicaly indian pakistani treat...i love specialy sesemi one
No!   Pecans only!
Hallo Gemma, please, if I would make a praline paste, should I break the praline block into pieces and then blend them in a food processor? Could that work well, in your opinion? Sorry to disturb, I'm asking everywhere on YouTube for a fool-proof hazelnut praline paste recipe, but nobody makes it for me! 😭 Many thanks.
Really love you thanks for your all amazing video which you had given us you are a good teacher proud t be your subscriber❤ oh and yes in Bangladesh we call it badam papri❤❤
This is so delicious
It's chikki in india❤️
Hmmmm.... never tried them, I’ll probably try makin them this weekend😋😋 but I have a question... if we’re not supposed to mix the caramel when it’s cooking because it crystalizes, why won’t it crystalize after we put in the butter and almond and start stirring? Hopefully my grammar makes sense to you because my literature is not good...😅😅😅
It's called gatta in Bangladesh.
I had forgotten about this! Gemma, you're a jewel. This week's project. Can't wait.
Hi Gemma, I am also a lover of praline. Thank you for teaching us how to make this most delicious treat, especially now that the holiday season is upon us. I must confess I am a bit weary of anything with caramel as an ingredient. But your demonstration on how to make your own is so helpful. I want you to know that when I am successful in making it ( notice I said when 😊 that is all thanks to you ❤ ) I shall be the first in my family to make a caramel and not use those candy pieces that come in a big bag that you melt down and call caramel! I'm not trying to put them down, they never met Gemma Stafford!😊❤💚❤
We make something similar to this here in India called "Chikki". Instead of almonds, we use peanuts. I love them but am afraid of all the nasty stuff that might be put in it. Now that you've shared the recipe, I can make my homemade version. Thanks for the recipe, Gemma :)
Hy gemma ur recipies r amazing....😍😍😍
