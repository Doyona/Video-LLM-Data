You made my day young lady and I thankyou for the sunshine that is you im going to make your bread recipe for wheat bread I've been on a sourdough journey and just made my 2nd loaf that came out a little better then the first one and that was really dense ! and im sure the 2nd one is not much better, its really fustrating because its not cheap and I can't afford to make loaves that you can't eat ! Lol so I thought I would try to make a bread that isn't as hard and thats how I found you my dear and the loaf you made looked lovely and yummy so I'll give it a try ! Thanks again !
I loooooovvvveee you Jenny!!!😘
Thanks  Jenny. For a simple recipe  that's easy to follow.❤
I had no idea this was Jenny Jones from the tv show.
You need an apron, Jenny!
I made today/really yummy 😊😋😘
What a riot
Is this cake?
You are priceless!
Lol..you're funny.😂
Trying to convert CUPS of flour to grams is killing me...
Is that Jenny Jones talk show host
Who’s your daddy 😂
I used the exact measurements but the dough is rock hard ..
What about the gluten free tribe , some of whom don't have access to the types of flours in America with real high rising ingredients?
"What can you do that is exciting in 15 minutes ? .... with your clothes on" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
her last recipe was 7years ago. where is she!!?
i just witnessed dough get dominated
Please come back, Jenny, you have a fan club and you haven't even done a video in years! At least let us know where you are!
Jenny, I just tried my first bread recipe of yours and it came out great! And I love your sense of humor, it keeps it entertaining. 😁
Wasn’t she an actress before?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF BREAD THE PILGRIMS BAKED? IT WAS A SPECIAL TYPE HARVESTED IN LATE SPRING. THEY CALLED IT... THE MAY-FLOUR!!!
"Who's your daddy" Hahah!
Omg wasn't you on TV years back?😂
😂I love the end😂/ you are beautiful and funny ❤
I'm 61. You make cooking easy and fun 😊
Ok so, your brownies are my go to recipe! Now I’m hoping your bread will be too!!! Thank you❤❤❤❤❤
Just stumbled onto your channel.. subbed Made this in my bread machine super easy. Thank you for sharing Perfect so yummy ❤
I can’t eat wheat so could you use all AP flour to bread flour
Who knew Jenny was a stand-up comedian too, lol
This woman is dangerously efficient in that kitchen! Bless her!!
You can make great tasting wheat bread without egg and milk. I did!
This is the best bread recipe ever, and it is so delicious. Thank you Jenny
I know you don't have the time to respond, but I just wanted to say thank you. You're a joy to watch, and your recipes have worked great for me. I'm so grateful to you for taking the time to make these videos.
I love this recipe. Thanks for sharing.
Can I use honey instead of sugar?
So simple and delicious! I make white bread all the time but tried this recipe for the first time and I love it!!! ❤ thank you for sharing!
Any idea how long this should be kept in an Air Fryer in baking mode? Anyone tried it? Definitely have to use less dough I guess.
“Who is your daddy” 😅😂
🎉Amazing 😅
Who's your daddy?  lol
Its not 100% whole wheat bread. How would we make it with 100% wheat flour and get the same rise and softness? Reason I ask is my mom cannot have white flour.
Can I double the recipe?
Lol!! Wait until the end of the video😅👌💖
I LOVE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR!
What volumes are the cups.
Would have liked to see you cut and butter the bread!
That egg cracking sound effect startled me in the end. 😂
Simply the best ❤❤❤❤
Thanks for giving us your measurements
😋😋💐
Thank you for the tips and the wit 😇
I made this bread yesterday. Recipe is very easy to follow and the bread is delicious.  Thank you.
Jenny. Where the hell are you.
Love to try this one. I need to check in our shop for bread flour I do bake bread.. Egg rolls.. Sesame rolls..
just done your bread and it rose a quarter past the pan like yours it cooked and never got bigger like yours whats wrong , I did it with the machine like yours
Jenny you are the best.  Miss you. Please come back. ❤️❤️❤️
took 50 mins why is that
very pleasant to watch very easy to make thks
I have bread for many years and many recipes, but this is the best single loaf I’ve ever made!
Hi ! Chef Jenny please help me how to make healthy Croissant.thank you so much ❤❤❤
So, made this today, or attempted to.  When she said mixer on high for 2 minutes.....I did that and got wheat bread dough/flour all over, clear across the kitchen.  Well now I tried to figure out how to overcome this.  It was really dry so added 1/3 cup warm mil, 1t olive oil and honey and 1/2t yeast.  Well it's on the rise now, I hope.  We shall see.  This is easy enough....I may have to start again from scratch.
i found another recipe that does not add eggs , milk  and sugar is optional...if you making bread for religious fasting this recipe won't qualify due to having milk and eggs
Mine is taking forever to rise before baking 🤔🤔🤔
ALL INGREDIENTS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE
TIMER PREHEAT OVEN
375 F.
4 INCH PAN ON BOTTOM
NO EGG
Once before I tried this and made changes (until Frankenstein's monster bread appeared.)   I took your advice today and didn't change a thing...( I did have to let it rise 70 minutes until it was 1" over the pan)  ...The result smells beautiful, looks fantastic,  tastes like a dream!!! My husband deemed it "THE BEST bread you've ever made!?!" 👏THANK YOU!
I love this vidoe even though its 9 years ago ❤
I started making this during covid quarantine March 2020 and it's been a staple in my house ever since. Make 2 loaves at a time. Store in a plastic bread bag/zip lock bag, preferably in the fridge. Freeze what you can't use up within 4 -5 days.❤ 🍞
love this recipie
Your are adding all purpose flour and calling it whole wheat bread?
Thank you for this recipe! Looks easy and delicious! I can't wait to try it!
At 5:04 she said you don’t have to grease the pan. I love her, but this was not true in my case. The loaf stuck badly and I had to dig it out and throw everything away.
I’m crushed. Everything went fine until I tried to remove the bread from the pan, and it was stuck badly all around the edges. I ran an offset spatula around the edges but it was still badly stuck to the bottom. I had to dig it out of the pan with a fork and throw it all away. I wish I had oiled the pan first.
Way too funny! Who’s your daddy!
My first time watching one of your videos and I absolutely loved it. You’re so funny and nice and the directions were easy quick into the point. I cannot wait to try this today.❤️
I tried this and it came out amazing
Hi what can use to replace the egg.
Can use stand mix hook
I was confused about the egg, but I think eggs go into brioche so eggs, and  sugar and oil produce a more enriched dough.  Your loaf rose so pretty.  I've never had a loaf rise this quickly.
Very yummy and fluffy❤thanks for sharing
I desperately wanted to start baking my own bread but couldn’t find any whole wheat recipes that worked.  But this turned out perfect!  I used Jaggery powder instead of sugar and it still worked wonderfully!   Thank you so much for teaching us non-bakers how to bake at home! ❤
10 seconds in to this and I'm wondering why she looks and sounds so familiar. Then realize it's Jenny Jones! lol I don't know if I have seen her in a good 25+ years since I used to watch her talk show. If you would have told me 30 years ago I'd be learning how to make bread from her I would have never believed it. Thank you for the video and recipe!
Can I cancel the egg?. what can I put instead of the egg? Thank you.
I love her!❤ She’s a gem 💎 This is my first time seeing her or any of her videos bcos I wanted to make some yummy wheat bread 🍞 wish I had met her/her videos sooner 😢this is content!😌
Lol, this videos was way too funny😅😂😂😂 made my day😅😅😅 now im motivated  to make my first bread😃
Lol, who's  your daddy😂😂🤣🤣
First time seeing you. I used your exact measurements and my dough seems dry. My ingredients are fresh. I have never had nice elastic dough like I see on any videos I watch. :(
It's beautifull
Can I use only whole wheat flour and not the all purpose bread flour?
Putting the egg in your bra is the greatest cooking trick I've ever seen!!  You totally rock!! 😂
Period pooh, im gonna try this in a few days when I have all the ingredients and report back…
Hello, I don’t drink regular milk. Is it replaceable with soy milk or just water?
Hello from Canada! Every recipe of yours that I've made has turned out well. I make this bread by hand and only knead about 100 times. It is so much better than "store-bought." My husband loves it. Many thanks. And I love your sense of humour. cheers
Who’s your daddy 😂   Way to go momma 🙃
When you’re done, let it rest for about an hour. Then slice, add real butter, garlic, and mozzarella cheese. Toast for 2-3 minutes. OMG!!!
I just baked my first loaf of bread from scratch. It came out perfect, thanks to Jenny. It’s so good I cannot in good faith buy another loaf from the supermarket!!!
Well I Got me some Wheat Flower Today and Will Make this  Looks Great !
Can you make this bread without the egg?
Omg! As a challenged breadmaker, I found this recipe today and made it today - the quickest, easiest, most straightforward recipe I have come across EVER for bread. It was a success. If I can do this, anyone can!
Imagine being in South Korea 15 hours from anything that is familiar and then having my Korean wife make an excellent loaf of bread- using your recipe. To say thank you is not even close to the appreciation we feel for your work. We can enjoy some "familiar" food together now!
This was actually so funny ...  Caught me off guard 😂
Thank  you Jenny, I have been baking this Whole Wheat Bread a few times, always comes out so good !! So Tall , 2 inches taller than my loaf pan. I used my bread machine to do the kneading and proving. So simple and delicious bread.
Followed this recipe and for the very 1st time, bread came out perfect
VERY NICE VIDEO  WELL DONE!!!
I absolutely love her recipe. What happened to her? She hasn’t posted in years
It was very educational and funny 😂 too.   I wished you cut a slice to show the inside at the end. 🥺Thanks a lot!
I just found her channel this week and made her no knead bread. I love her channel. She cracks me up too.
Ok, so I've baked this bread twice now and my wife and son don't want us to buy any more bread. They want me to make my own. It is absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for sharing!
Made this twice within a month. First bake was great; second bake the dough rose but then deflated before i put it in the oven…same batch of ingredients :(
Why you don't cut this Bread???I will see it..
Very nice presentation
This channel is funny 😂
Who's your daddy 😂
Yet another youtube video stating Whole Wheat bread, and then they add regular or bread flour.  SMH.  You should rename your video, mostly whole wheat bread.  My search will continue...
Hi Jenny  tried your bread recipe today for the first time …it turned out beautiful….thank you so much❤❤…….Jennie from vancouver island B.C. Canada.
I make this bread all the time.  It is my go to recipe.  Simple - easy
i'll do it !
We love you and your recipes🥰
Hola, como extraño este canal, me fascinaba. Tiempo sin ver sus recetas espectaculares. Que todo esté bien. Saludos
I will try your recipe and thank you for this video. The ingredient list on today's bread looks like that of a Nuclear reactor..and as toxic with all those Engine (Canola Seed Oils), Dough conditioner, (Plaster of Paris) Cellulose, Processed flour which is mistakenly called, (Enriched) because the processing removed the bran, oil, mineral and vitamins, they added 3 ingredients back to the GMO flour and now call it; (Enriched)
I made this whole wheat bread today and it turned out really good. ♥️♥️♥️
My daughter and i used your recipe to make our first loaf of wheat bread.  1st loaf was definitely under kneeded, so it didn't turn out as fluffy. 2ed try we kneeded it by hand but I'm still not sure we did it long enough however it turned out 75% better than our first loaf. 😊
Because of Jenny, I will never not spank my dough ball and shout "Who's your daddy?!"
Loves your videos you are the bomb
Jenny, what is the best way to store our bread after we make it and it's cooled down in plastic or wrap? I know I only have a few days with this loaf but I haven't been happy with it in plastic bags like ziplocs gallon bags
Wow, The Jenny Jones!
Came to learn a recipe  and has a good laugh with the whose your daddy remark . Lol
Mines going into the oven right now . I used kefir instead of milk .
I gave thumbs up not only for the great recipe, but also for creative and fun joke at the end. 👍🏽
Thank you so much for your recipes and videos. They've helped me a lot. 😊
Can you bake this in a bread dome? An alteration of recipe needed if cooked in a dome? Thanks
Is this Jenny Jones the former talk show host?
👍👍👍‼️
i followed this to a T, with the exception that i substituted in almond milk for the milk. I ended up with a goopy unusably sticky mess. :(
Thank you for using all the measurements atlest I can follow with my basic ass tools
Can someone please explain what is the purpose of putting an egg in the recipe.
Oh my god!  This bread recipe is fool proof guys!  Just make it!  It’s so healthy and sooooo easy.
Is there advise for if it doesn’t rise on the last 35 min rest?I followed everything to a T, but I’m so discouraged. I don’t understand.
😅😅😅😂😂😂 love it
which number shelf in the oven?   the oven has different shelves.  There are the bottom one the next above, the middle one, the upper shelf, etc and so forth.
I made this today and it has been my best batch of Whole Wheat bread yet!!!! I love the humor in here too.
Hhhahahahahahhah
Thank you Miss Jenny! You're still sweet, kind and I enjoy learning how to cook from you. I hope you enjoy retirement 😊
Omg rofkmao!
Just made this today. Came out amazing!!! My mixer was put away and I didn’t feeling like unpacking it so I did it all by hand… perfect
my friend always warms her eggs in the way you demonstrate, haha!!!!!!! nice to know she's not alone in that!
I am so glad this recipe is still on utube. It is so easy and equally delicous.  You have quite the sense of humor also. Thank you. Are there any new recipes. I will try some of the ofthers that is already shown.
Hi Jenny?  Have you ever made sugarless bread?
What an absolute goat <3
My kids don't like this bread because they always eat whole wheat bread with high sugar 😢😢
My kids don't like this bread because they always eat whole wheat bread with high sugar 😢😢
Hilarious😂😂😂
She is so funny
You are just cute. Going to try the recipe.
Can I use butter vs oil ??
😂😂😂 0:19
😂😂 this is too good lol
Jenny where ya been ?? Missing your beautiful smile and great recipes. ❤Vacation is over , come back pleaseeeeeee 😢❤❤❤❤❤❤
Your so funny You make bread how I do  Thank you for the refresher course and a good laugh that I needed so bad Sam😊😊
Jenny, we miss you! Always loved your talk show! Your recipes are so easy. I live in NYC and tge price of bread is through the roof. I've been making my own pizza, cakes, and pastas. Ive never baked bread before and dying to learn how. This is so simple! The best part is that is fresh and you know what's in it. Thank you! I wilk be baking this today 4-18-24
Thanks. I decided to try making whole wheat bread many months ago. Did many many searches for a simple recipe and couldn't find one, until today. So glad I found this recipe and am gonna make it today.  and... I am it's daddy..... LOL.  or will be. I hope.
When you say put it in a warm place, where would that be?
Can regular bread flour be used rather than whole wheat?
Please make some new videos; yours are the best!!
"I'm not doing it, you cant make me " 😂
Hi Jenny, I looked through the FAQ but couldnt find an answer......can i use a bread maker with this recipe?
Jenny, you are the funniest lady!
Can I use all purpose flour
An egg??
This woman is a national treasure ❤
Funny and creative ❤
I put all the ingredients in a bowl, mixed it with the stick end of a wooden spoon, kneaded it in the bowl just to make sure everything was blended, put a cover over it and left it overnight, put it in a bread pan after kneading in the bowl for a couple of minues, let it rise until it was a bit over the top of the pan, baked it for 35 minutes, perfection ! (I used the "Steve" method of 2 bread pans kept together with large bull clips to get the dutch oven effect for bread making).
Can you skip the egg for people who don't eat it?
I want to make this and put dried Cherries in it. what do yo think?
This is the way that I learned how to make bread
Thank you 😊
I how naughty this woman is. I would love to take some sex education courses with her.
Love the ending you crack me up pun intended. lol
"Who's your daddy" made me spit my drink
Thanks for the wonderful recipe. Is it possible to substitute egg with another ingredient?Want to make an eggless whole wheat loaf.  Thanks
Sure enjoy your tutorials .... Thank YOU so much.
Can this process work with white bread instead of adding wheat flour  My white bread is always a flop
NOT GOING TO MAKE YOUR BREAD, YOU RUINED THE BREAD BY PUTTING IN WHITE FLOUR, WHICH WILL TURN INTO SUGAR, AND IS NOT HEALTHY 👎👎👎
Lmao
Fantastic
OMG Jenny Jones!!!
Two times and made glue, added 4 extra cups of flour on the last one.. more glue
This bread is amazing,easy , quick and delicious thank you so much !
Thank you for the straight forward explanations. I just want a simple bread recipe, and you'd be surprised how complicated the recipes are that I have found! I'm a stay at home mom, and I just want something simple to bake that'll be easy to get done somewhat quickly, and this seems to fit the bill! Again tysm
I used all purpose flour only and it worked well. This the best bread recipe.
Jenny thank you. Love your sense of humour ....lol... loving watching your videos and trying all your easy recipes.
Lol love this
Lol i just made this and had to copy her "who's your daddy" just for good luck. Its in the oven now lmao
This is my first perfect whole wheat bread by following your vid, thank so much!!
Can I make this without the egg, or what could I replace it with that is vegan? Just egg?  thanks made your breads all during the pandemic!!  order flour and yeast as you could not buy it in normal places.  tk goodness things are not like that anymore. Thanks for the bread recipes fun.
You was great, definitely going to try to do  wheat bread  now  Thank you
Omg! New subscriber here! I thought she was gross, not until sne accidentally cracked the egg on her breast 🤣 gonna check out her other recipes!
I love this channel. I remember Jenny Jones on the talk show. These are easy, basic recipes and always tasty. ❤
Thank you.  I baked my first loaf of bread today with your recipe.  I am so happy and it was delicious.  Your right... I don't have to buy bread from the store.
DUDE YOUR SPATULAS ROCK 🔥🤘🎸❤I'm hooked☆☆☆
Can someone advise me about proofing my yeast (I need to do) in the milk prior to adding to other ingredients? I've kept my yeast in frig and it's been there a while!
Just made this bread. Easy and delicious! Added to my recipe book and sharing with my sibs! Dziękuję from one Polock to another!
I noticed Jenny used a dark loaf pan.  Has anyone used a light pan?  And if so, did you raise the oven temperature by 25 degrees since they say if you bake with a dark pan, you should lower the temp 25 degrees?
can you substitute reg flour with Almond or Coconut Flour?
I tried it today. Easy and practical recipe. Turned out good.
I have made this
This recipe is amazing. Just made the loaf, and sliced a big chunk straight out of the oven. Really really delicious bread! 🍞
Lmao she’s crazy❤.
Can this be made with all purpose flour?
"Who's Your Daddy?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She’s so darn cute.   I’m going to try this.  Looks easy.   I’m just learning.
Love, love, love your sense of humor
You are the fastest subscribe I've had by far 😂 i love your humor and I'll definitely be trying this recipe
Thank you Jenny for this easy recipe! I made this bread today I was over the moon how great it taste and how easy it was to make.  It was a very cold day in Southeast Michigan 1 degree great day to stay home and make bread, thanks to you for making it fun, easy and you explained everything so well.
Trying it! 😂😂love the script
not funny at all girl ! u look mature but ….
I just made it is delicious and easy, this is a keeper thanks for sharing, I smack it too who’s your daddy,  thank you
😂😂. You need a cleavage
Looked just like your picture turned out beautifully. Except when I went to take it out and put on rack right away, it started separating. In the middle. Why did it do that? Wa it may be not quit done. Stuck it back in the oven. Will let you know
I WAS WATCHING THIS TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE BREAD I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS THE "WHOS YOUR DADDY" VIDEO BAHAHAHAHA
Thank You for providing the Full Recipe!
Could I make this recipe without the sugar?
Thank you. You're a great teacher.
Great taste shame it stuck to the bottom of the tin!! I was going to grease it but she said no??
Just came across your channel and can't wait to try this wheat bread recipe.   I absolutely loved your TV talk show. I always felt you have a sweet and nice personality with a don't cross me mfer on wait in case someone tries you. 😂
Ha! If only I could be an egg! You are not only a talented cook but a lovely lady with a great sense of humor! I just subscribed because of that.
Anyone know why pastry flour won't work?
can I add some flax to it and psyllium for more fiber
Thank you for this quick wheat bread recipe. I watched several times before I finally measured out everything ( 6 hours because I am disable and it takes me a while to do things)  and I I take time and get it completed.           I am happy to say how the dough is taking time in the pan to rise but that’s wheat flour for you.         I miss seeing you and all your cooking and craft ideas.   Thank you very much.
New to your channel I love it and you’re right who’s your daddy😂😂😂
Thank you for the wheat bread recipe.
I had to proof my loaf for a lot longer. I did 30 minutes the first time. I also had to preheat my oven to 110, turn it off & proof it in the warm oven since I keep my house relatively cool.
Would dairy free milk work?
I tried making bread for the first time (not this recipe, a different one) and it turned out horrible. I was worried about trying again because I didn't want to waste ingredients. THEN I came across this video and Jenny makes it look so easy! I rolled up my sleeves and tried again. IT'S PERFECT! This is my go-to bread recipe now. Thank you Jenny!
My bread turns out fabulous except the outer part turned quite hard…how can I fix that? Any suggestions??
Is the only healthy bread to be ordered on line? Just curious
😭 The dough was so dry and stiff it threw a bearing in my kitchenAid stand mixer. I had to add extra warm water and knead it by hand. Now I have to buy a new mixer too. 😢
Do you have a recipe for Popovers?
Best USA home Cook meals ever!!!
Can you use all purpose flour instead of Wheat?
I’ve tried a lot of whole wheat bread recipes but this one is by far the best I don’t have a stand mixer so I kneaded it 100-110 times as you suggested and it was beautiful. Thank you! The best is you keep me smiling the whole time I’m baking
Nice Bread , Jenny, how much yeast would you use for instant dry yeast? because instant you  do not use as much as active dry yeast  ?
Thank u so much Jenny. I made my very first bread in my life and it taste exactly like those whole wheat bread in the market. The ingredients are very simple! I don’t have a mixer I use my hand, and I made it!, you’re amazing!!!
You are amazing!! I miss seeing you and with all your jokes! Who's your daddy? 😂 And "what you getting married "😂 hilarious ❤❤
I am here for the jokes 😆
Thanks to your instructions and recipes for baking a bread
Can we store the bread in the cabinet like the bread we buy from the stores?
She looks like the actress. Sorry. Can’t place but super familiar
Not yet tried the recipe but found her really engaging - " u can't make me" 😅
You are so funny Jenny
uh oh.... I just put this in the loaf pan to rise and now I see in the comments, the pan should have been greased, but it said in the video no need to grease it, so.... I'll probably regret not doing it...
Hi. I love your video and this bread! First time I made it, it slid right out of the pan…. This time it stuck though. Only difference from yours is that I used a glass bread pan instead of metal. Should I put a little sumpin in the glass pan next time? Mary
WHO'S YOUR DADDY
Jenny always had a vibrant spirit!
Very easy recipe! Came out great! Only thing is it stuck to my loaf pan. Next time I will grease and flour pan. Probably my fault!!!😂
I was not prepared for how edgy this video was going to be! Lmao
I dont like oven. Elecricity bill is expensive.
❤❤hi made this recipe came out great BUT IT DOESN'T WANT TO COME OUT OF THE PAN?? ANY IDEAS PLEASE.  TY
Thank you for your recipe and your time showing how to make a great wheat bread loaf..I have a question which brand of flour do you use ? And when I was kneeding the dough it keep getting stickier until I re-floured my hands and then it toughened up for awhile until it got sticky again  I used 1 1/2 cups of wheat flour and 1 cup of all purpose flour from the start every time it got sticky I was ap flour to re-flour my hands when I thought it looked ready for a window paine test it failed ? I think my problem is a low gluten based flour its GREAT VALUE BRAND
Great teacher! Thank you
I’m new to your channel and this is my first video. You’re so much fun and hilarious I’m subscribing ❤😊
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Can yo leave out sugar
You are so funny and and you look similar to Jenny Jones😃
Jenny, where are you? Why are you no longer posting videos?
Hi Jenny! If I wanted to make 2 loaves,  do I just double all the ingredients, as well as yeast?
❤❤❤
Hi Jenny, can I make bread rolls with this Ingredients Thankyou.
Hi Jenny i can't wait to bake  this delicious bread but with no adding egg will it affect the texture and the taste of the bread
Can you use baby cereal, multi grain instead of whole wheat flour and of course, adding in regular flour, have multi grain baby cereal
She started out good, but then contaminated it with regular flour... Heck just go to store and by it then
Helloo . . This recipe really works nice . Have been making bread using this recipe since many years . . Thank you so much ❤  I had one question if you could help . Offlate my dough has really big holes while rising in the tin and so while baking the dough sort of sits down. What could be the reason. Thank you 😊
Thanks I'll try it out
Hi Jenny, where have you been?  I’ve missed you and I’m sure many others as well.  So are we going to see some new stuff, I hope so.
7:29 Did that egg really broke in there ?😲
Too funny. Love Jenny. Appreciate all the recipes.
😂 I would like for her to be my instructor. 😂
Mine turned out great! I think I will try the same recipe but using dark rye flour.
“Who’s your daddy?”😂 making this today, thank you!
Thanks so much! The bread turned out great, perfect video!!
I really like Jenny. She is REAL. I'm  looking to buy her Cookbook as I keep downloading.  I'd rather have her book.
😂😂😂 You're funny
Can I substitute the sugar for honey?
Who's your daddy!?
Just did this exact recipe thank you my house smells amazing and my kids will be delighted
Thanks mom😊
Very very nice recipe . A small bread which is a good size for a family of two. Thanks Jenny
Just made a double batch. This is the best tasting whole wheat bread I have ever eaten.  Thanks so much
Your words are so true. Thank you
Why didn’t you cut a slice for us to see inside it 🍞?
Hi Jenny!  Why no “knead”  to oil the pan? I’m terrified  making my own bread! However this looks easy as well as delicious! Thank you!
Mommy?
Thank You 🙏  You’re very informative  The egg thing is hilarious 😂
That’s so good .. and no baking soda and baking powder … wonderful !
I've loved her forever❤
Can you use butter in place of the oil?
How can we not love Jenny! 🥰So cute and funny. Isn't she the best friend we all want?...and she doesn't borrow our clothes. 😂
Jenny ..this is absolutely the best...im so happy.This worked perfectly
How do I make this with all whole wheat flour?
Hi Jenny. Great baking tips. Hopefully you are still making wonderful delicious breads. ❤
I followed your Whole Wheat bread recipe to the letter but had to mix by hand as we have no stand mixer.  kneaded about 200 turns. Rose in about 40 minutes to the 1" point and into the 375 oven.  It came out quite good but didn't puff up in the oven like yours, maybe even fell a tad.  I don't think I added as much white flower at the final mix as you (how much wasn't quite clear) and the dough was quite sticky.  I wonder if it was too moist?  Overall it's a decent loaf but not as tall as expected.
she reminds me of martha steward wow...her personality and everything
Hi, I want to try your recipe but without egg and without wheat flour.  I want to put 100% whole wheat flour. Could you advise some substitutions or alternative ideas?  Thanks a bunch for creating yummy recipes 😊
I made your bread today & i put a little butter. Then i put a little olive oil on top while raising. The bread came out perfectly.  Thank you for your recipe.
Love your video and recipe! Thank you so much for sharing. I've been looking for a great whole wheat recipe. You're great, funny, to the point. An 8 minute video that is direct and straight to the point with an easy, yummy recipe, I can do that. I'll let you know when I try it in hopes that I will make the perfect loaf just like you. Ps- Love, Love Love all the color in your kitchen....a worthy cause to put your bread money into.🥰🤩😘
Jenny, do you also have recipe for loaf bread (white)?
Jennie!  I watch cooking and especially bread making every day but you are by far my favorite.  You are organized with everything at hand and you get right to it.  Sometimes I go to another channel when people talk a lot and slow getting to the recipe.  Your are the best!  Linda😢
Do you have to put the sugar in? Any substitute?
Hahahahaa, "who's your daddy?" made me laugh
That egg at the end cracked me up!  Sure do miss you Jenny.  Any chance you will make some more videos?
This is a great recipe and so easy and quick to make. Thank you very much.
I am running to do my whole wheat bread right now! I will let you know later how it was. You make me smile about your suggestion of heating the egg and spend the money on spatulas, it was fun! Thank you.

Wow, finally a whole wheat recipe that comes out just perfect on the first try, thank you. It’s delicious
Jenny, I miss you.
Oh my goodness!!.... its Jenny Jones the former talk show host!!!.. I love you Jenny and I am thrilled to see you!!❤❤❤❤❤🇿🇼🇺🇲
I really like your videos. You make the steps so clear and easy. Your positive delivery really adds to the fun of watching your recipes. I love your collection of spatulas!
Peaceful Greetings,  thank you so much.  Missed you from TV.
I liked the egg crash!, hahaha!
It's fucking Jenny Jones!!! I love it, I'm making the bread now ❤😂
Searched for  "who's your daddy?", wasn't disappointed. 😂
Her recipes all work
Yum!
like z end of it 😄😁☺ U r so cute
I am your daddy!
This was awesome very easy and delicious 😊thanks
You crack me up!!!  Pun intended.  I'm gonna make this soon. Thank you.
Lady adds white flour and title says how to make whole wheat bread 😂
Easier said then done
Wait…Jenny Jones?! Mind blown.
Can i have water instead of milk
You crack me up dear Jenny. It's soooo good to laugh. What a professional approach to work and laughter! :)
This recipe is amazing! Thank you! ❤️  I had originally made a different recipe and after 20hrs, I ended up with an under-cooked and salty bread. Thankfully I found your video and was able to save the day with a quick, easy, and delicious tasting bread in just 90mins.
I just used this recipe. Not only was it sooooo easy, it was delicious. Thank you!
Just made this and it looks amazing, but it stuck to my pan! Help!
Beautiful kitchen. I like your hair band. Very nice. Explain Very well. I try it.thank you.
I bake mine at 350 degrees for 45minutes no need to cover woth foil wrap it turns out perfect!!!! Thank you Jenny ❤
@jenny can cook. How are you doing? I’m going to bake this bread now 07/06/2023 @9:47pm eastern.
can we skip all purpose flour
Jenny, thank you for your kindness and generosity. Your recipes are terrific. I’m going to give this bread recipe a try. 🇨🇦
Hi wld like to try this as looks simple but I work in grams and can't work it out can you help please
I think I saw you somewhere.  Did you have your own talk show, once upon a time?  You show step by step how to make it, but you did not cut the bread, to show the texture.  Thank you.
Is this Jenny Jones?
whos your daddy
Make sure the milk is hot enough don't use all the extra flour and grease and flour the pan. Other than that. Great video and bread should turn out.
Hi Jenny, What could be a good substitute of egg in the bread? Thanks!
You are hilarious Jenny ! Thank you
I made this dough again today. A double batch and used it to make calzones. It turned out great again.
Bread came out v good but I don’t know Alice are breaking. If you can tell reason of breaking bread slices
I have the dough mixed and ready to sit and rest but it doesn't look right. It's very oily for one thing. I guess I'll find out how it is when it rises and finishes baking. I'll be really disappointed if I can't say the same wonderful things the other posters have said
Ok so I made this with a kitchen aid mixer and it was perfect…the softest and biggest loaf I ever saw…BUT…my mixer broke, I had to buy a Hamilton Beach one and now my bread isn’t as soft or big….any advice? Do I need to double the mixing time ?
😂
Where were you  Jenny. ..my search ends now.  ...happy to see you after l andhalf years
Hello mam, yesterday i tried your recipe it came out very well . Thank you One small doubt i hope you will reply what will happen if you add egg?can we  replace egg .
Yay!, Im so happy I came across this recipe. How do I get the white bread version?
lol adorable!
I made it with my Ninja's bread attachment.  It worked and is delicious.  The only thing is that it is more dry than moist.  How do I make a moister bread?  Thank you!
Just made this bread for the "umpteenth" time. So delicious. My mother-in-law's favorite. WooHoo!🤩🍞
Jenny Jones, former TV talk show host.
Made this bread today and came out perfect!  Took about 50 minutes to rise but otherwise the directions were spot on!  Thank you!
Hi  hey maybe have  the recipe  come up on your screen  for peers to try your recipes  out', Just thought.?ll😊
7:35~ "What can you do that's exciting in 15 minutes, with your clothes on...?  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So then, are you married ? (Alan, Glasgow, Scotland, GB)
I followed your recipe because it sounded simple and fool proof.  I didn't use a mixer, just used my hands to mix the dough and kneed it. I kneaded it for 100 turns.   I shaped it and put it in the pan to rise for 10 minutes.  It did, about 1" above the rim.  Then I put it in a ungreased pan, like you said, and put it in the oven.  It NEVER did rise any higher after baking!!!  I baked it for 30 minutes.  Took it out of the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before taking it out of the pan.  Well, it stuck, so I had to loosen it with a spatula and finally got it to come out.  The bottom was still moist.  I am letting it set before I cut it.    Can you tell me what happened?????  I would love to have it turn out like yours.  I have made bread for years using a bread mixer, and never had any problems.  But, I wanted a easier way instead of getting out my bread mixer.  Please reply.  Thank you.
You are So much fun !!!! Just love you !! Lol thanks for teaching it so easy
This bread is so good isn't doesn't last a day in my house. Especially eating the bread right out with some butter is the best way to eat bread. I love the simple way to do this recipe.
I put my cold egg in warm water
Has anyone tried doubling this recipe? If so what are the measurements?
So is it 2 cups whole wheat and one cup bread flour, makes three?
Funny. Love your videos
Hello Jenny I'm from Slovenia. Great bread, quick and easy to make. Please, if you can also write the baking temperature in °C in the recipes. Thank you 🙂
First of all, I am so excited that you have a channel I can watch! I used to watch you when I was growing up (don't ask me if it was food network or where.. I'm  getting older and aging less gracefully than you, tell your mom).  I have failed so many times at bread,( except artisan, no knead in a Dutch oven,) that my family has asked me to stop trying. I found this and was so excited. I am letting it rise in the pan as I write.. I will let you know how it turns out, but know I appreciate that you are still doing your thing!!!! Laughing while learning is a big deal these days for me!
Thank you Jenny for the lovely , easy to make absolute jem of a recipe. The best.
I know this video is 8 years old but your bread is timeless! I made this yesterday and OMG it's delicious! I got lazy to take out the stand mixer and just kneaded by hand and it still came out very good. Thank you Jenny ❤
In grams please 😢
😂❤❤❤i love this lady she is funny and beautiful ..😅😅😅 much love from your sister here in kenya
Where are you Jenny!!!???
Brilliant.
Speaking about her cleavage joke. I remembered she was the first spoke out about Breast implants and had hers removed. I think she said hers leaked or something like that. Oh and the bread does look amazing.
Any veg substitute for eggs
My wife used so many different recipes to make bread, but none of them worked. Thanks to your recipe, she made her first successful loaf of bread. This recipe is easy and amazing!!!
Hi Jenny, I've been enjoying your recipes very much.  I don't have a Kitchen Aid Mixer, but I do have a Cuisinart Food Processor with a "dough" setting.  What is the kneading process for using a food processor?  Do I still need to turn the dough out onto a surface and knead for 50 turns?  Thanks!
U r so awesome funny beautiful love ur hummer u fill my hart with joy an I learn alot ❤
Spank that dough..Who's your daddy..Lol😊
Loved the egg Warming  thing,so funny!!!
I followed Jenny’s directions very carefully and was rewarded with a truly delicious and beautiful loaf.  Thank you!
haha she's funny. I can't wait to try this and the tapping of the dough "who's your daddy!" 😂
I love everything Jenny including you! I love all the videos but I would have rather had you slice the bread open in front of us than playing around with that egg. I didnt' even get the point??? I'll watch the white bread recipe and maybe you will slice it at the end. I think the most important part of all food videos is when the food is cut, sliced, open, or exposed and put into the mouth. That's what I always wait for! Aloha
She’s so funny. What happened to her?
Absolutely adore her personality!
What if I use melted butter insteadnof olive oil?. Will the taste be ok? Thanks
Can I use this recipe for white bread?
Im making your recipe because i like your vibes
I want to thank you.  I've tried several different recipes.   Yours is the best
I'm not doing 150 turns you can't make me
woulda liked to see inside the loaf
Jenny, you're so lovely and you know what you're doing! Thank you for taking the time to share this recipe with us! Best Wishes!
OMG I FUCKING LOVE YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm a fan! You're the best!
Love this recipe Jenny.
I’m going to try this my bread by hand machine is a joke
I can't wait to try this recipe  she so funny
I remember watching her talk show
I’m going to try this today!
This bread was perfect! Thank you so much! I’m gonna try Rye flour next and adding caraway seeds for a nice rye bread !
Im watching seriously til i saw the ending 😅 Subscribing now ❤
I like your sense of humor, I’m trying your recipe today
I am usually not a baking person  but this recipe was very easy for beginners like me and I am so proud of myself that my bread turn out so good.Next time I am going to use different seeds on it .Thank you for sharing your recipe .I made 3 batch ,here is the final product .
You are funny! 😂
Hi, how long did it cook for?
If you don't have a mixer go out and buy one. ;)
Who's your Daddy 😂😂😂
I have been making your bread for months now and I just love the way it turns out every time.  My husband has even followed your video and done a great job making it as well.  Thanks for a super job and a great recipe!   My husband loves your humor!!
can i use honey instead? if so how much honey?
My go to baker…🥰
You’re adorable Jenny! ❤
So NOT wholemeal bread flour?
7 years later you are bringing joy and a laugh! Love you and your entertaining videos.
I just tried to bake , fantastic! I am not going to do white bread any more. It is so easy to bake a bread l like. Thanks !
Jenny, just baked your wheat bread. I used whey instead of milk.This is the best bread i have ever made. The bread was so soft and delicious.
jenny, love your bread, it never fails. Your since of humor cracks me up.
I made this, and it is perfect!
By the way my comment comes up under my husband’s Google account name ( I just sent a comment about my stiffer dough) but my name is Zigrid. My ethnic background is Latvia , a neighbor to your Poland!
I have really enjoyed getting acquainted with your cooking shows! Your personality is hospitable and cheerful. I am waiting for my 90 minute whole wheat bread to rise for its final step of baking it. I see your dough looks lighter and softer than mine was ( stiffer and more brown) although I followed your instructions and used quality ingredients. Hoping the end result is satisfying. Thank you.
Jenny you're tooooo adorable & you're such a joy to watch. 😍 Thank you, Thank you for your quick, easy & delicious recipes. I use to shy away from making homemade bread but after watching your wheat bread recipe I will no longer buy bread. Three cheers for Jenny Can Cook... ps "who's your daddy "I 💖this woman
I followed your recipe last night.  NO mixer.  150 folds.  My first perfect loaf! I subscribed and followed because I discovered you do goofy things at the end of each video and I find that enchanting.
What can i say...i love your colorfull kitchen but once you put all purpose BLEACHED flour that's NOT A WHOLE WHEAT BREAD ANYMORE🤷‍♂️
Thank you, Jenny. I enjoy your recipes very much. You are so easy to understand
I can't believe I didn't get into making my own bread during covid 202 /2021 but I am getting into it now so I'm excited woo hoo
I did your recipe here along with you jenny,but my milk went bad so ichad to use almond milk,sweetened ,I hope it didn't ruin it because I think it will be too sweet now right?well I'm on the first rise and when I take it out and try it,I will let you know,thanks for this recipe and oh,I did it all by hand and dough came out better then any other time ichavecmade bread,so hopefully it tastes ascgood ascit looks
Fantastic recipe! I stopped buying bread and make this weekly. I just wish my dough would rise as much as Jenny's. I'm using Fleischmann's active dry yeast. Not sure if that makes a difference 🤔.
You lost me at 1% milk.
More videos. So funny
I’m so glad I found you. I finally conquered my fear of making bread after making this bread today. It is awesome!
Do you have to add sugar?  I don’t like bread that tastes sweet.  I love your artisan bread recipe and I want to make loaf bread for sandwiches.  Just wondering if sugar is needed.  Thanks for any info.
Followed this to the letter... didn't work.
Lol novel way to warm up your egg.
Love all the little coloured cups where did you buy them please?
🇨🇦. Where has Jenny gone?  It’s been years now.  Anyone know please?  I love her recipes.
I love her the way she talking  funny and very soft spoken lady,bring  smile, on my face while I was little worried about first time making bread,but after follow her recipe,I made the bread,
My bread turned out great but was too crumbly, is there a way to fix that? Thanks
I’m 69 y/o, never really made bread… maybe three times. I’m not a baker, don’t know bread techniques, and thought bread fell every time you make it. BUT! I made this bread just the way Jenny says, and it turned out perfect!  Thanks Jenny.
Whoah. The jokes are funny and unsuspecting
I made this today and followed recipe instructions exactly.  I believe it's best to do it as directed before changing the recipe.  It took hours to rise!  Granted it was very cold here in Ohio and rained all day.  It was beautiful, but probably needed to rise a bit longer... the texture was excellent and good flavor.  I highly Recommend this recipe ❤
Spank that dough...snack smack..whose Ur Daddy 🤣
Hi can I use honey instead  of sugar
Hi Jenny, I love all you cooking. Can I request how to make a fresh soft vanilla cream cake which is wheat and soya free. If possible dairy free. My son is allergic to all nuts, soya, wheat and oats.
What a great, humorous presentation.  Could not be improved.
You are so cute and funny, God bless you all
❤️ Making this tonight for my 3rd time! So delicious and my hubby favorite of all the recipes I have tried. Thank you!!👍
😂 you are hilarious Jenny.   Am definitely going to try this receipe. Thank you.
Jenny you’re great. I wish you were still making cooking videos. ❤
You are a national treasure. I appreciate your recipes and your sense of "humour". Yes, there is a "u" in Canadian English because we Canadians like to include "u" in our humour. The bread will be delish, I am sure. Love and respect. Cheers.
Can you this without egg
Can you use whole wheat flour instead of the 1/2 cup of all purpose?
Great video. So funny and entertaining!
🤣 love you
3:54 Jenny is wildin'
I bought whole wheat pastry flour by mistake. Is that going to be a big problem?
I've made your whole wheat bread recipe twice now and they both came out perfect, whole wheat bread recipes that I've done in the past have always flopped. Love your smile and great personality
P.s., I tried to "wing" it cause yr recipe was UNDER the grain mill...(found u, opened drawer, cleaned under, and voila!) (Wingin it did not turn out well, BUT your bread is PERFECT EVERY TIME!...p.s.s., spank you very much!...😂
Found ya!...great recipe!...did this 1 in 2020, but now I'm back cookin/bakin from scratch!
Can I use Almond Milk instead of whole milk?
Jenny you’re hilarious 😂 plus your recipes are always on point.  Hang in there. ❤🎉😂
My girlfriend just bought me a big standup mixer because i like to bake and i want to venture into bread baking.  Im fluent in cakes and cookies and things of that nature, im glad i ran across this video.  This looks like a great starter video for breads.  I dp have one question.  Say i wanted to add some honey, how much and would i need to make changes to any of the other measurements?  Thank you.
Good . Very well explained.. Madam, the egg can break under your shirt
Thank you Jenny for sharing a delicious and easy whole wheat bread. I love your sense of humour!
Jenny check your transcript Please-I laugh at your funny comments but I've referred to this&made it many times-watching it(👍❤️) What You said was "I don't buy bread anymore"-, not I don't vibrate"(transcript) makes one wonder about what besides spatulas🤭
Thank you for the recipe, such a nice and uncomplicated bread. It raised so high and is lovely and spongy. The only thing I'm not entirely on board with is the amount of sugar, I could still taste it in my sandwiches. It's just too sweet so next time I'll put half the amount and maybe just give it more time to raise. Well my house is cool in winter so it took an hour to raise above the rim anyway
Thanks for this recipe,my bread turned out great.
I love your rooster!!!!
Is there a way to avoid the all purpose flour? Just use wheat
Hahahaha I can’t wait to try this
Hi Jenny, I made this bread for the first time last week and it was a hit.  So today I made your white bread version and it was equally wonderful.  I've also been making your no knead breads in the dutch oven and they also have been a hit.  I don't think I'll be buying bread from the store any time soon any more.  Thanks for your wonderful tasting and easy recipes.
Whapp! Whapp! Whapp! Who's your daddy? I darned near spit out my coffee!!!!!
I really miss Jenny :(
Girl you had me jump out of my seat!😮😅😂😂🤣🤣🤣. You are definitely a funny woman. That’s why I subscribed long te ago😎😎😎
I love your charisma 🤗
Jenny Jones, come back to us and make a new video. You’ve been away too long. I’ve been a fan of yours since your ‘Jenny Jones’ talk show back in the day. 🥰🥰🥰
i just finished  watching your video and you're so funny. Thanks for the information. I am going to try this recipe today. Many blessings in the New Year.
😂 nice
Re  Made recipe.  Bread stuck to bottom of pan.  Looked good, but taste was bland. Maybe adding honey instead of sugar would help. Otherwise easy recipe. Good for toast and sandwiches. I need to freeze but first cut in slices.
Hi Jenny. Love your site.  Great recipes, great presentation, fun atmosphere...and you're  not the least bit obnoxious......can't get any better than that 🥪  ♥ 🥪
I don’t like egg in bread
Do I hv to use eggs. ??
Love this bread! Thankyou
How am I just finding this!? This is super simple and I love your humor! I can't wait to make this bread.
Thank you for being so specific and dare I say positive as well!
My bread isn't rising above the rim of the loaf pan. I followed your directions exactly. What could I be doing wrong?
Using also milk,eggs that makes it really nutritious..Only I wish to use only whole wheat flour..
Hi , please tell me if I want to make white flour bread is it the ingredients.
How long u r kneading in kitchen aid?
Every Christmas I bake bread, and every year I tell the same joke.  Q: What do the following things have in common: The sun at midnight, the once-rebellious south, and Jesus when it's not easter? A: They’re all more likely to rise than my absurdly dense loaves of homemade holiday bread.  Well, this year I'm not jokin' around because I tried Jenny's recipe and the bread actually rose! It's the fourth "easy recipe" I've tried in as many years but the first to actually turn out well. Trust me, if I can make this recipe work, so can you.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣GUESS SHE KNOWS THAT FROM EXPERIENCE.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That last few minutes of the video with the egg is gold!! Thank you for the chuckle.  I'll be saving this video to try as well. :)
Thank you for the instruction.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Your recipes never fail! Just made this bread. Its wonderful.
how about using a Bread-maker !
Who’s you daddy 😂😂😂❤
lol!!   you're  amazing!!!!   nice  job.  i'll  be  back for  more    videos.
Jenny you are so cute!  And thanks for sharing this.
Took a lot longer to rise than in the video/recipe.  I don't have a counter top mixer, so mixed ingredients by hand.  Also used regular yeast rather than fast-acting yeast.
Why the sugar if already salt? preserving? No Olive Oil?
Who's your daddy 🤣
I can’t believe how much I miss this videos. ❤️
Holy Shit!!!!! F-ing Jenny Jones!!!! Why am I just finding out you have a cooking channel! Loved The Jenny Jones Show back in the 90’s!!!!❤
Helps if you have cleavage 😂
Helps if you have cleavage 😂
😂😂🎉 awesome. Baking your bread loaf on a quiet, Misty morning in merry old England. Appreciate the comedy too
I love everything you make.  I have tried several things and everything is delicious.
I miss her.  ☹
Jenny the wheat flour I get is 25% protein i didn't add any other flour it came out very heavy any suggestions help .thank you .
I’m on a Whole Food Plant- Based Diet. Am I allowed to have this?
Hello Jenny, love this video. I tried it but my bread came out kinda firm and dry. Can you tell me what I might have done wrong, please? Thanks!
I tried this recipe today, very easy.. except you say dont have to grease the pan...well I didnt and the bread stuck to the bottom....so here I am making another one and I greased the bottom.
I love all of your videos. Can this dough be used to make rolls instead of a loaf? Has anyone tried this?
:)
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
thank you not only for how to make but for being you i miss my mom watching you it helped me remeber some good times with her she was always cooking  and she would never shut up always was talking and talking i miss her thank you
;good recipe can't wait to try this
Jenny Jones? You making bread now? Imma use the recipe 😋
what can I use to replace the egg? can I use yogurt? thank you 🙏
Do I Hv to use eggs I don’t like putting eggs in bread
LOL Love you Jenny!
Can you eliminate the sugar ; if you Diabetic?
I made this bread yesterday with freshly milled wheat and it was fabulous! Making another loaf this morning and I actually used my cleavage to warm my egg to speed up the process after seeing you do this! LOL Thank you for a simple, yet delicious recipe!! (and your humor) LOL
It’s not 90 minutes for everyone sadly. I live in a cold, damp, hilly place and my bread took a whole hour to rise. It was definitely yummy though and an extremely easy recipe to follow. Thank you for posting this!
How long your bread could stayed ?
It's like that one time your mom made a slightly ribald joke. So much funnier given the source
5:45 5:48 Do not rise too much because it will pop up.
LOL! Jenny egg..  Thank you for the recipe.  I am going to try it
Hmmm. Looks lovely, but I need to make it vegan. I'll replace the egg with "egg replacer" powder, use all whole wheat flour, and use warm water instead of milk. I hope it works out well.
Hello Jenny,  I have not seen any pure whole weat meal here where I live. But we have a flour which is 60% regular white weat flour and 40% whole weat flour. Surely I should be able to use that for this bread?
Thank you for sharing I tried it and my husband is so in love with the bread he wants me to keep making more bread 🥰
😅😅 nice video, 👌 thanks
Very interesting and looks easy recipe…. What can I use instead of egg?
BTW...Your Perrogies are fabulous
Hey Jenni Could you find a high altitude bread like this for the folks up in Big Bear Lake, Ca. It's quite dry up here. And, baked goods are made up here with adjustments to the ingredients. I and other Mountain Dwellers love your baked goods. Thanks
Doesn't look promising. The result is fake and untrue
I made whole wheat all the time in bread machine...it never rose to the height of your!!! What is the difference you did. I think yours looks wonderful. Every article said that it was a heavy flour so I see yours!!! Yours did!!
I am laughing so hard!!! Thank you Jenny for the great recipes and the laughs.
I remember your show Jenny!
you are histerical. I really enjoyed this video
This recipe works really well.  Thank you very much.
I’m doing this tomorrow
I made this bread for a church dinner and it was well received!
Yummy 😋😋😋🍞
I know those was posted  very long ago , I stumbled upon it looking for a quick whole wheat recipe.  It worked perfectly. I did need more than the 1/4 cup bread flour. Will make this again
I just made this! I’ve never made bread. I did not think it would work. It legit is PERFECT!!!!!!!!!
😂 u are just hilarious... I'm going to try your recipe with the whole bread...
I hope you still read these responses.  You are great!!!
Omg! I love it! 😂You’re so funny and beautiful. Thanks for the recipe. ❤
My dough was too wet, so I added more whole wheat four. We will see!😅
My bread turned pretty crumbly and dense. Any ideas?
Made this twice now by hand, no mixer, and lost about 1/4 of it because it stuck to everything like Crazy Glue. Didn't rise as much either. Will a mixer help? I am obviously not doing something correctly.. Jenny can Cook, but I  sure can't bake!
I miss you so much, I hope you and your loved ones are well! 💞💞💞💞💞💞
My dough doesn't rise
Can I use just whole wheat flour?
How to substitute egg in this
Hi Jenny hope you’re having a good day I just have a question can I use all white flour and not whole week thank you again
So funny😂
Omg I had to comment, followed the recipe to the T and the bread came out so good. I used whole wheat flour too, it was perfect thanks Jenny this is getting shared!
Tried your way of cooking this 2nd time had to throw out was very watery
Jenny Show, I remember used to Air in the 90's
Jenny can we simply double this recipe with no adjustments?
Freudian slip of the tongue by Ms. Jenny....Hot Cross buns next video please.
Jenny you are so funny😂😂😂
Quick and easy. My kind of cooking because I don't like to cook and cleaning up. I have chicken and have gone to bed with an egg in my pocket
Jenny has always been such a ray of sassy sunshine🌞😍
I made this last week, it was perfect.
"who's your daddy" caught me off guard 😂😂😂
I don't know why every recipe on you tube has to be quick and easy. You may be making acceptable bread by skipping some stages of the process to make your bread fast and easy, but you aren't making really good bread. You are cheating your viewers.
Bread is good but really need a longer first rise
Hand mixing and kneading 8 min works just fine.  It turned put awesome.
WOW! so easy
Thank you
Hi Jenny, I have tried your Simple Whole wheat bread, it came out wonderful.  Now I want to double it,  do I double all the ingredients in the recipe, can you please help me.
Very funny cook!
I made ten loaves yesterday and wanted to make some more today, but I'm out of eggs. Can this be done without them? I'd like to try using soy milk  instead of milk, would that work?
Uhhhhh so I was just on Facebook and it showed a clip from a talk show that was Jenny Jones. I remember that show in the 90’s. Then it hit me!!! That’s Jenny can cook! Jenny can cook is Jenny Jones. Well I’ll be!!! Pretty cool!!!!
Thanks Jenny for the amazing recipe.😁🙏🏿👏👌👌♥️
Legit recipe for sure as i have made this exact recipe serval time with excellent results.
Wonderful !   I did it today!  Thanks so much for sharing ! 🌹   I already sent it to close friends .
How come you stopped making videos? I just loved your channel
If i want to make bread i use bread flour
You are absolutely amazing 👏 ❤ thank you 😊 you make my day!!!!
I love your blouse
Transcript
She is funny and so cute. And she can cook! I love this recipe. Thank you.
Great recipe great bread.  Maybe use less foil?  So harmful, from mining to transport to manufacturing to packaging more shipping and finally disposal.   Thanks for your great and thoughtful recipes.
So how did the bread turn out? Missed the part where you sliced it. Was it light / heavy or somewhere in between?
I’m going to try this recipe this weekend!! Once, I was baking and had an egg warming in my apron pocket. A delivery came, and I hip checked the door  to close it, without thinking! There went my egg! 👩🏾‍🍳🤦🏾‍♀️🤣🤣
Watching you in 2020 and I hope you are fine Jenny  🤗🤗🤗 . Thank you for sharing these amazing recipes
By chance do you have a recipe with the stand mixer to make white bread I do not use my oven anymore I use an air fryer can you help me out I really would like to continue my baking series LOL with you
Your spatulas are so colourful, I just loved them.
Great to be creative. Do you think I can substitute honey for sugar and what would be the equivalent amount?
She makes me think of simpler times!
awesome
Jenny,  your so funny
Damn she went out like a legend.
A fresh whole wheat bread out of different fresh breads with a fresh caldo out of different fresh caldos
I just mixed everything together and kneaded the dough. I however omitted the all purpose flour. I don't believe in all purpose flour. I hope my bread dough rises.
I wonder if these measurements work in bread machine, will save time.
👍💖👍😂💖👍🤣
Yooo i thought i was done until she did the egg warming 😂 anyway thanks for the class ms lady
Yo she caught me off guard for sure with that who’s your daddy line  😂 w the smack 💀 but she’s know how to make the bread that’s all i came for 😂 🍞
I like to watch your recipes but hate your lack of modesty, no need for doing it, your fine without those jokes.
What is the flour weight in this  video I made it but was very small I don’t know the size of your cups I like you cooking
I used 1 tsp yeast.  Works
OMG! Just made this bread. So easy, so good! So soft inside!
I love this part 3:57, "Whose your daddy?".  Ha HA. You made my day!  I just made this recipe tonight for Hamburger Buns.  I did exactly what you did, but I divided the recipe in about a dozen slider buns.  My family LOVED them, thank you.
Delicious, but for me I would be "minus the egg"!
Why my bread is crumbly when i slice it? Is it because i didnt knead it long enough? Or i forgot to shape the dough after it rise for 10mins? Cos i just completely forgot about that step and i just rise the dough in my baking pan, n when it rises 1in above the tin, i just pop it in the oven. Which part is the mistake? But it still taste good. Its just very dense n crumbly
Winner for me thanks
You are the best :)
I know this is an old video but I tried it this morning and it turned out perfect and delicious!  Thank you for sharing!!
Thank you very much Jenny for this  post on how to make whole meal bread. Iam watching from Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Region.
What if you want 2 loafs?
Lol and the egg in the boob too… she’s a hilarious mess
OH MY GOD... this is THE Jenny Jones!?!?!?!
Simply loved her
Can this be made without egg?
Very nice mam.
Jenny: if you are reading this I made your "no kneed" bread recipie using wheat flour instead of white flour. I used the FAST RECIPE (MORE YEAST, FASTER) and I "proofed it in a tiny crockpot (lined with parchment) putting a few drops of water underneath the paper. After the first 30 min with lid on, I turned it on, high, left lid on, for about another 30 min or so and it was wet, so I put this round (it was high!) in the air fryer for about 5 min to toast seeds on top. It was so moist! I didnt even use milk like this recipe. Dense like a brownbread! Yummy!
Love this recipe. I get a perfect bread everytime, I did add 2tbsp flax seeds to it and just whole wheat without any flour, it turned out great, thanks.
Very good wheat bread recipe thanks
What brand of bread pan did you use?
Great teaching! Going to try asap! :)
I really get a kick out of her..
HELP!  I used this recipe twice and was able to get soft and fluffy bread.  However, the bread falls apart when I tried to cut it.  How do I increase the elasticity so it does not break apart so easily?  I used a stand mixer and then kneaded by hand, following the recipe instructions closely.  Thanks in advance!
How much is one cup of flour in ,weight, i want to try this good video. Love from uk 🇬🇧
Thank you. I finally made a decent loaf of bread with your help
The whole family LOVED your bread
❤❤❤
love your bread recipe with a dash of humor ❤️
Omg Jenny Jones 🤣🤣🤣💞💞💞💞
She had. A talk show which I enjoyed!
im going to adopt her
Can I put wholemeal flour without bread flour?
😂Love from Clyo GA. Thanks for your awesome videos🙌🏼🙏🌻🎚🌹🌼💕
After rising 1 inch above the pan on my counter, my bread fell in the oven. What did I do wrong?
You said you dont need to grease a pan.  I didnt and the bread got stuck in the pan.
THANK YOU!! I really hope you can read this! I happen to surf YouTube and saw bread recipe, its Juine9, on TV are the January 6 findings and today is , just over two weeks since Uvalde and I have not stop sobbing.Your delightful and made me not onkly smile, but laugh out loud BLESS NYOUI!! BTW I can't cook although the chocolate cake recipe you have here works with gluten free flour. I was impressed that I could do art was so simple, and I loved the story about you washing a dirty base ball.becxause someone wrote on iy "SORRY"
You had me until you add sugar I'm trying to make some healthy bread
you are very talent
So funny! And amazing at the same time. Between who’s your daddy and where you’re hiding that egg 🤣🤣🤣 love it
I like this lady, and her oven, and her spatulas. Great simple recipe for WW bread. Next time I make WW bread, hopefully no bricks. Need a Kitchen Aid mixer though.
So funny, 😂 and good too, I'm saving this to my breadmaking playlist!
'Whose your daddy!" she's funny and a great cook!  Where have you been all my life?!
M
Oh my goodness! Not many people make me laugh out loud while watching a video alone but she had me giggling!
Jenny is hilarious!!
I already have a bread recipe but I decided to try this and didn't like the way it taste.....😐
For a singular person, how long would this last left out in bag/container or refrigerated?
Lady! I have never been so delightfully surprised watching a cooking tutorial. I’m so glad to have found you. I’m trying your recipe and I know I’ll succeed. I’m a 65 year old Mexican-American and I make perfect tortillas so this is going to be a cinch I believe! Thank you..!!!
Iv got the whole wheat flower but i got chunks in it( from the wheat) do i need to get rid of the chunks before making the dough
I was just thinking in my old age-I get my smarter than me phone out&make this same bread with Jenny-I suppose I should write it down🙄😉👍
Jenny, you are ALWAYS a delight!  And the bonus?  Your recipes always turn out beautifully for me. Thanks so much!
2am 5/22/2022 I just tried your recipe, except... I didn't want to knead it 50x so I used my dough hook for about 6 minutes and then did about 30 folds... it came out great except it did rise above the edge of the loaf pan and maybe an inch above that in the oven... but the crust was nice, and the crumb was tight and not too dense... except for the rise it was a success for only my second loaf... Thank you... "Who's your Daddy"?... LMAO...
I didn’t realize she’s Jenny from talk show omg I’m glad she’s keeping herself busy
I tried this recipe both with the wheat and white flour and I tell you it is delicious! Thank you Jenny for sharing!
Easiest and best wheat bread I've ever made!   THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!!!
Thank you for teaching me this
we need more videos like this jenny
I made it today and it’s so delicious thx a lot
I made today and it’s so delicious thxxx a lot
Is the outside of the loaf soft? I'm searching for a recipe that doesn't cook my bread loaf where the outside is a bit hard. I bought some whole wheat berries, milled them and every time I use the whole wheat, my bread loaf is a bit hard. Maybe it's because I've been using recipes that use white all purpose flour?
Who's your daddy!!! Ma'm I want to send you new spatulas for making me laugh so hard hahaha!!
You are so funny, when I am done, I just jump on and you are a toot...I got a kick out of your show today.  LOVE IT.
Jenny is awesome..
Hello Ms Jenny, I love this recipe! It is my go-to for homemade bread, but to make mom life easier I recently purchased a zojirushi bread machine. Do you know if this would work in a bread machine, and if so what settings I would use for it? Thank you so much!
ohhh cringe worthy... but I know you were trying (smiles)
I make this and love it. Can all white floor be used, for a change?
I love this bread , can I substitute honey for the sugar,
You are so amazing. Love your recipes. God bless you.
So happy to have found your channel…I am laughing so much!!!
I don't have one of those mixers. So how long should i knead the dough for?
She's a weird broad in the best way. Protect her at all costs.
can you eliminate the egg because I am vegetarian and get the same result to the bread Please give me feedback.
I always thought baking bread was not easy but I tried doing it for the first time with your recipe! So good!  It just didn’t raise as much but the taste was great!
Jenny I've been making this bread for years now. It's my go-to bread for whole wheat when I want fast bread at the last minute. My other go-to is the no-knead. Both delicious! Thanks!
love your spatula collection and all the vibrant colors in your kitchen accessories ❣️ miss to see you pretty jennyy 💖 excellent egg warming tip 😂
Excelent bread!!
"WHO'S YOUR DADDY!" 😂🤣😂
Just made this bread yesterday and my husband and I just love it.   Thank you so much for this great recipe.   One question, how long can I keep it out on the counter?
there goes your cleavage!!!
HI, JENNY......I grind my own wheat, and am wondering if there are any modifications that need to be made to the recipe, i.e., the flour is heavier than commercial flour which doesn't contain the oil and alot of the bran?  Can hardly wait to try your recipe!  Thank you very much for your help!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can this recipe be used with half stone ground white whole wheat & half artisan flour?
Thank you for a lovely recipe. My bread did rise nicely and tasted great. This is a keeper.
Ur so positive and funny I love it so much
I made this bread several times already, we love it. Its very easy to make. I usually double the recipe.
There was apop-up from her that said, 'correction' but I couldn't read it! Does anyone know what it said??
I miss your talk show...bring rude jude on sometime...cheers
@jennycancook I have just put this recipe together...and it's rising.  As a (DISABLED) woman, I am grateful for recipes I can manage without asking hubby for help.  Have a blessed Sunday.  LUCRETIA
Great recipe. Can we skip the sugar?
Yummy 🤤
Do you have to add sugar to this?  I would love to try to make this multi grain bread, just curious if I can omit the sugar?  Thanks!
Cracked me up. Making this bread soon
Haven't made bread in years.  This recipe is so simple.  Bread came out perfect.  I used powdered milk by adding the powder to the flour and then adding water.  Also, forgot to get egg to room temperature early enough.  Ended up using your trick. HaHa!
Can you do it with flax egg instead of regular egg?
First time I have seen eggs in the titties, lol
Hii! Plz specify a replacement for egg in the recipe.. Lovely recipe otherwise. Love from India!❤️
🥺 You better hope that egg doesn’t hatch. 🤣
I did it! Came out perfect! Thanks!
Cute! (The end) I'm making this bread. Thank you!
Great recipe! Love the ending!
LMBO you're too funny! I thought a chic was going to hatch...lol
❤️😂🏆
You are great! God Bless You and yours!
You are great! God Bless you and yours!
Jenny is “hot stuff” Thanks
I love Jenny and her recipes 😋
You’re awesome.. love your humour! And the bread was amazing! I too  started making my own bread in the last few months tried several recipes and so far love this one the most.
I usually forget to warm up the egg so I microwave a couple cups of water for about a minute so the water is warm to the touch, adding more water if it's too hot. Then I put the egg in it for like 10 minutes. As long as the water is lukewarm, the egg will warm up and not cook.
Waaay too much flour!!!
Jenny like Jenny jones from the tv this is great so excited to find you on here and your so helpful
Thank you for this non-intimidating, uncomplicated recipe. Shows that anyone can do this, with mostly pantry items, unlike some of the convoluted and pretentious all day recipes from other sites. Love your gadgets and sense of humor too.
Hi Jenny I just found your your website and made you whole wheat bread it was delicious just wondering can do you have a recipe for white whole wheat bread
Cut the loaf !!!   Great instructions thanks i am gaging with laughter
Once flour is added, it is no longer whole wheat bread.
funny, no counting ,yes i will try making wheat bread.
I mill my own whole wheat. Sometimes I use all hard red berries, other time hard spring (white) flour, Sometimes I mix them half & half.  Is there any  benefit by adding additional wheat germ?
I think my house is too cold. The second rise is taking too long. what can I do?
Jeyyy, I don't think you are being honest with us.  Apparently you aren't real crazy about this recipe either.  I've tried a lot of wheat bread recipes and this one would be just too heavy.  I really wanted you to slice into this loaf, and when you didn't I think you are like me, you like a lighter wheat bread too.    Keep up the good work, I love your videos.  Even when you pull a sneaky one like this on us.
Omg! What a surprise! So glad to see your face. Loved your show back in the day. Subscribed ☺️
I will try this recipe, lately my bread has not been rising… by the way you are Hilarious 🤣😂🤣
Me too!!! 🤣😂🤣
You made me laugh about the egg with surprise🤣😂😝
Made it using brown sugar...Amazing!
I don't have a mixer so I have to stick with your no need breads
I made this bread too☺👍 it was amazing 👏
I think I want to get the mixer too🤔 I just need more space to put it😏
Thank you  trying to make this recipe🤞
She need a tv show.
Please do yourself a favor and buy 1b SAS (or other brand INSTANT) Yeast and store in freezer (in mason jar) till you need it.  You will likely have enough for 2 years if you keep it in freezer till you spoon it out into recipe.  Much cheaper and I've never had a fail with SAS brand as long as I didn't add too hot of a liquid.  INSTANT does not mean RAPID RISE.  It simply indicates it instantly hydrates and can be added directly to dry ingredients.  Does not need to be activated in water like some yeasts.   Those store bought packages are expensive AND while this type of yeast can get you a bread in 90 mins....WHY do you need it that fast?    Slower (say bread with 1 rest and 1 rise, at maybe double the timing,  means you will have less stomach upset because the nature will work on the gluten while the yeast works.  Slower fermentation means a better storage loaf.  Not so important if you have no kids under 2 years eating it, or are only making 1 loaf for 1-2 days only.   Old baker here.
Oh Lord what a hoot (Romkc)...”rolling on my kitchen counter”<Oh Wait? 😆! I love you Jenny Can Cook❣️
I love this bread recipe and video!
This looks good and all, but the thing is.... It's no longer actual whole wheat bread. Why is it so impossible to find a decent recipe for 100% whole wheat bread? You can find 100% whole wheat bread it literally any grocery store, but for some reason it seems like it's some impossibility to make it at home. WTF is going on?
I like this lady.
You give off aunty vibes
Hi and thank you for making me lol 😆. My bread turned out wonderful. It was hard waiting for it to cool completely but it was well worth it. I added some multigrain cereal to the mix at the end and it was beautiful. Thanks again.
Can i substitute the milk with plain water ?
Thank you Jennifer
You are amazing!!! Your recipe is wonderful and your humor sends me every time! Thank you for sharing.
Can this be doubled?
I don’t have whole wheat flour. 😔 or real milk. Guess I’ll make the other recipe.
Gooooood Gawdddd!!!!!!! The egggg!!! I skipped a heart beat!!!!!!!!!!
I love you Jenny.   I tried  the faster no knead bread recipe of yours so I am on to the Whole Wheat Easy Simple  I even put the egg in my cleavage.  ha ha ha
Miss you, Jenny!
You crack me up! Love your channel
Ugh.. so disappointed in my KitchenAid.  I tried making this and it could not handle the dough!  Rocked it all over the place and eventually disengaged the bowl (thankfully I was standing right next to it).  Nothing on your recipe, just me crying as I had been in the fence for years (on buying a KitchenAid) and recipes like this one are what helped me make the jump and it doesn’t work for what I purchased it for 😞  Thanks for putting this recipe out there...just wish I had your mixer.    UPDATE:   Just sent to use my mixer again and realized that my wisk attachment was all beat to hell from trying to make this bread.  Not the fault of this content creator however, I would strongly advise against using your mixer, the way she uses her's.... or maybe I just had awful luck.
Hi Jenny, where have you been?
I made it! It turned out amazing! Thank you so much for sharing!
Update: ITS AWESOME
Hello Jen Can I use white flour ?
Trying this now :-)
Who knew baking wheat bread could be such a turn on? Fantastic sense of humor. "Who's your daddy" with the slap killed me. Great info seems easy enough to try. The bread that is.
Are you Jenny Jones who had a talk show in the 90s?
She is THE Jenny Jones from the popular TV talk show in the 1990s. Very entertaining and oh yeah - she CAN cook. Just love the ending!
Going to try to make this whole wheat bread today, one quick question, can you add honey to this recipe?  PS made your meatloaf recipe last evening it was the most delicious meatloaf we have ever had.  Thank you.  Going to definitely try more of your recipes.  10 STARS...
why didnt i find u earlier...
Jenny thanks for posting this excellent bread recipe. I have tried it and it turned out great!  The taste was superb too!
Can u put an egg wash on that before baking??
LOL "whos your daddy". Love it!
GREAT& BEÁUTIFULL, THANKS .
!!! GREAT& BEÁUTIFULL. !! THANKS.
Ah! Hilarious and funny- All in the name of Baking ,i love it.  Great sense of humor.
Hello. Made this  today. Easiest bread I ever made. It was beautiful. Smelled fantastic. Gifted it to my brother inlaw. He said it was delicious. Making some tomorow  to keep for us.
Can you use regular flour in this recipe?
I'm gonna try this but switch the white flour to coconut flour & see what happens
Made my first loaf and seriously it is perfect! Thank you💕
THE BEST GODBLESS
Lol you're so funny and a great baker❤
We miss you Jenny
I wish we could see the crumb!
what can you do in 15 mins that's exciting with your clothes on? 🤣😂🤣
Oh my gosh I just realized this is Jenny Jones from that 90's talk show. Wow! Who knew she could cook too! I have loved every recipe so far Jenny!
Love your bread Jenny, quick and easy.....
Who's your daddy!  lol
It's not whole wheat.
I’m going to try this recipe. Thanks for sharing!
You are very entertaining. I want to be your neighbor.
So I tried this recipe.   The part where you say "and if you do it without a mixer, you'll just have to do it 150 times by hand instead of just 50", I thought, well ok I can do that.   OH MY GOSH!   I made such an incredible mess!  I did not realize how sticky it was, it got all over both hands and then my 3 year old started helping.   lmao I've never had so much fun.  Pretty sure I did not do it correctly.  XD   But we had fun.
Hahahaha .....you are amazing too
Amazing 😉 ...thanks
I subscribed at "Who's your daddy" 😂
Thanks. Great sense of humor
How did I not know Jenny had a cooking channel AND she's funny. Subscribed!
😍😍😍😍😍💖
Bread making video is incomplete without slicing it. Slicing would help better than sensual jokes :)
My dough is not as soft and pliable as yours. I thought I followed your measurements exactly. Is it my whole wheat flour?
Tnx :) 1 cup of flour in grams is exactly 125 grams?
She’s my favorite person to watch cook.  What a hoot she is.  Will be trying bread recipe after trip to store.
Just wondering if you are still making more recipes?
Wow Jenny you are an amazing woman!! An so naughty 😂😂 love from Ireland 👊👍🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮
Lucky egg ! ;)
So happy with this bread!! My boys eat bread faster than I can buy it! This is PERFECT!
😂😂 The Egg 😂😂
U r wonderful, I love you voice.
Please can anyone help me? Can I substitute whole wheat flour with multigrain flour in this recipe?
Very funny Lady ! Love you !
OMG is this so I think it is?
Love this, and will be trying it soon
Never a dull moment with you 😂
This came out perfect. Thank you for another great recipe.
Did you use your own milk for the bread.
Thats the best bread recipe ,I ever try. Thanks 👍👍👍
beautiful spatula like it
Thanh U Jeeny,you are a sweetheart 💖 💕 ❤.
Hello Jenny; I just made this bread and it came out very nice. Thanks ⭐
I followed this recipe to a T and it turned out dry and overbaked even though I baked it for 30 minutes, what could have gone wrong?
I miss watching you cook💕
Omg you just make me chuckle... Love all your videos... Can't wait to make bread
Look alike. Some actress
What can I use instead of eggs?
Funny with the egg 🥚
Can you make it honey wheat and add honey?
Can I simply omitt egg
YOU CRACK ME UP!!and your recipes are good too hahahah
I am gonna try that receipe this so easy..thank you my funny lady....God bless...
This was delicious bread!!’n   Just love your recipes!!!!
Jenny, you are so beautiful  all round. You made my  life  very easy .. Thank you
Hi, thanks for your recipe. I tried making the bread as per the instructions. It didnt rise as much and the bread was crumbly. Any suggestions?
WOW !!! I haven't laughed so hard at a YouTube video in a long time when you're spanking the dough and saying "Who's your Daddy ?!?!!"😂 Thank you for the laugh and the VERY informative video
I made this for the first time today and it came out perfect! I didnt have any all-purpose flour so I subbed in cake flour and it still worked out fine. Thank you so much!
Well done I love that mixture
I made the decision bread it came out very nice. But the only thing is mine has a little split on top. Wonder why. Did I do something wrong?
120' or 110' ? For milk?
Always weigh, NEVER use cup measures.  You'll have much more success
Hey jenny--  Wow that was quite the experiment,,So I havent exactly made alot of bread.  I spent the first 45 minutes trying to get it off my hands !  I about died crackin up. Good thing my wife wasnt home, id never hear the end of that one.   Eventually i managed to roll it into a big hot dog shape.  spent the next half hour trying to clean up and hide the mess. I swear I made cement that cleans up better than this stuff.  No wonder nobody makes homemade bread ! So I put it in the oven to warm up and rise.  Well its been an hour and a half,,it aint rising.  So now what do i do ?  I guess im gonna bake it.  I hope it rises in the oven,,,,,  well it didnt rise much,,but looks like its a square bread,,maybe ill be hungry enough to try it in the am,,,
OMG! The last time I saw you was on your show way back when. You look great! I have yet to try this recipe. Thanks!
Jenny you're a clown love it :) thanks for all your help
Hi, i have tried twice, both times, it doesnt rise.
I don't know who her camera man was. But I'm surprised they didn't fall over laughing. 🤣
Hi Jenny,  Merry Christmas 🎄, As I was searching for a good recipe for a Christmas cake and accidentally I found out all your good recipe’s videos on YouTube.  But unfortunately I couldn’t find any special Christmas cake recipe uploaded by you.  Why???   Anyway I liked your “Who’s your daddy” recipe and hopefully I’ll try asap. Thank you for sharing your recipes and your precious time! 🙏
Are you saying 275*F or375*F?
soooooooo cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
great video, great joke with the egg! my wife & I didn't see it coming! can't wait to try this bread. I am 70 and just started to grind & make bread, you recipe looks easier than mine. thanks so much.
Aw I'm hooked😊
Anyone knows why Jenny stopped cooking?
How can she make a such beautiful bread and don’t cut it at the end of her video???
>>>  3:58 <<  !!   " Whos your daddy" ??   Best line ever , as she spanks the dough !!
Bringing her standup background to the kitchen. Love it!
I just made this today to go with some homemade soup and salad. Amazing aroma and texture.  I baked bread years ago and now using this I will start again. Took 90 minutes and wonderful. Your recipes are always spot on and I love listening to you.  Thanks for doing this!
If i use rye in stead of wheat does anything else change?  Tanks, John   P.S. I'm half Italian & half Polish, so make me an offer I can't remember.
did she just say whose your daddy...HAHAHAHA...LOVE IT!! SUBSCRIBED
When you have mentioned whole wheat then Adding All PURPOSE FLOUR ….. means  Maida !!!  The purpose of whole wheat is Over right there!!
Hello from Mumbai India, madam what is the measuring cup size because Indian measuring cups are of different sizes, or could you please send me in grams and what is the alternative to eggs ?🙏🏻🌹 Please reply.
Question, Jenny:  If you say we can use bread flour or all-purpose flour and it makes makes no difference, why can't we just put 2 1/2 all purpose in the bowl together instead of 2 first, then 1/2 later?
Love this recipe....
Thank you Jenny you're  such a sweet soul
This recipe did not work.  The dough did not rise.
Love her ❤️
Hey, Jenny, dear, fickle Jenny, in your printed instructions you say "place it in GREASED pan" and on your video you say "don't have to grease it".  I am well trained to listen to instructions, but this sounds confusing!
Will you marry me?  My wife said it’s okay.
Im going to make this soon! thanks so much, your the best to watch!
Makes really good toast.
14, 15,16,48, 49, 50😁good counting 😝your funny. Love your videos 😍
My mother recommended this recipe for me to bake my first loaf ... it turned out perfect! Thanks a lot for sharing this. Your videos are amazing.
omg jenny is halarious  hahhahahaha
Very funny the eeg part
I made one today and it was perfect!  Thank you!  I will leave to you smashing eggs in your chest, 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I have to agree with the comments. This bread comes out light, fluffy and delicious! I've tried other recipes in the past, but the bread always came out too dense. This loaf of bread tastes amazing. Love it! Thanks Jenny!
Where have you gone darling? Weiss you
Where have you gone darling? Weiss you
Great receipt. I just made this today.
I love your jokes
Love your recipes, not to mention your bubbly personality in the kitchen. Thanks to your channel (which I came across by accident), I have regained a renewed interest for all things cooking and baking. :D
thanks Jenny, I made the bread yesterday, it is delicious.  Thanks for your recipe .
This Lady Has been in the Lime lite for years  God and time has Blessed  Her .
Lol don't have a dough hook?
At first I was thinking  this is some kind of funny video . When she smacked the bread and said: " who is your daddy" the bread looks good. We all should have some fun cooking like this
Lucky egg.
This was so easy and good!!
Haha...n you thought the egg is safer there! I just discovered your channel n now I’m in marathon on ur recipes 💕
Entertaining and very effective style of delivery. The proof of the bread is in the eating !! Let’s see. Thanks so much.
Seeing as the majority of the world (USA population 330 Million making up 0.42% of the World population of 7.9 Billion) use degrees C and metric measurements, I'm really surprised that only the packet of Yeast at 7g was in metric.
Some 20+ years ago I used to bake all my own wholemeal bread & rollls.....went off the boil and bought shop made.....now I want to get back into the home bake stuff.....thanks for the recipe, bit different to the one I did with a mix of flours etc but home bake is good and always on hand too in my freezer...........Ian from Melbourne in OZ
Where is Jenny have not seen her in long time....is she ok....
I love her outfit !!  Great show, thanks
very good 👍
Hi my name is Nazira  I made bread at home before many times using other recipes , but this time i copy your recipe for making bread and o my Allah that is the best bread made up. Your recipe is the best of all, its just really professional and outstanding.♥️👍
That was hilarious “no surprises “
Well I've always been afraid to even attempt making bread because every recipe I tried was like a chemistry experiment (where my yeast never took off & my loaf didn't "rise".)   This was the best recipe ever!  It came out perfect.  Lovely brown crust & soft on the inside.  Store bread - Bye Bye!!!☺
I wish it was without sugar, egg & milk for a diabetic, lactose intolerant & allergic to eggs this is not the bread albeit, loaf looks real good!👍
Your the best , I want to make everything  You make , your the best teacher, and you make it look so simple
Wonderful!
LOL you are funny. Egg on braw LOL
Do you cook anything with the cloths off?
Premier essai et vraiment réussi.  La prochaine fois je relève de 1 niveau la grille du four.  Thanks! 👌
I just loved this!  Great personality!!!!’ A USAF Veteran   Maryann
Ι would prefer to cut out the egg if it's Ok ?
I'm sorry - egg, milk and sugar in a whole wheat loaf? This is cake, not bread haha. This is a culture shock, bread here is made up of only flour, salt, yeast and water.
Isnt this the Sex n the City star!
90
Do you happen to have the ingredients in grams? I followed a recipe off a yeast packet that called for cups vs grams and it was really dense! When ever I make bread I always measure grams. Could you convert?
Hilarious. Bought the flour,now I have the recipe
Jenny: "What can you do that's exciting in 15 min..." Me: "Oh well I don't know-" Jenny: "...with your clothes on?" Me: "Oooo daaaaamnn Miss Jenny!"
Hi...I`m trying to learn how make my own whole wheat or multigrain bread because these days you can not find a good bread for people with diabetes like me. I can eat small pieces of bread but I really hate the sugar on bread. Every day the bread companies add more and more sugar to their products and I can`t find good places to buy what I want. Can you  please do a video for the diabetes people if you continue cooking...or recommend me other options. Thank you!
I just about died when she slapped the dough. Was not expecting that, was just trying to learn how to make bread hahaha
Thank you for the  information you make it look very easy
Jenny, do you know how much I love you?  What a joy your video's are.  Thanks for the laughter!🤣
Thank you. It’s 2021 and this recipe is still the best.
"Dull side down" ... mind blown 😳
Thank you so much for this recipe
So funny and makes everything so easy and simple. ❤️❤️❤️
Hi can add some butter
I always put my eggs in a bowl of very warm water to bring it to room temperature quickly.
Hi Jenny I made brown bread for the first time. It was excellent. Thanks for sharing.
Excellent!!!
Can you use regular white flour in place of whole wheat and would it be the same amount
My favorite Jenny quote is "I'm not doing it and you can't make me" LOL
Oh my gosh! I havd tried for years to make yeast bread and failed every time.  This one worked! Just took it out of the oven, and it is beautiful! Used white whole wheat, and a hand mixer.  Thank you so much, I am just thrilled!💯👍
"You can't make me." LOL.
Thank u Jenny, this is my go2 bread now.  I use the dough hook and u can't stop me, lol
Lot of sugar!!
Hey Jenny please let me know can I do this in my bread machine?. I don't want to ever buy store-bought bread
I failed so many times.. i tried so many recipes and always failed. THIS TIME MY FRIEND!  I did it! I am so proud ❤️❤️❤️❤️ thank you so much for the video!!!
I followed the recipe, even checked the temp of my milk so it wouldn't be too hot, and timed everything and my dough had not risen to the amount you specified for the amount of time you specified. I made sure the yeast wasn't old as well.
I’ve watched a few videos, and just now realized ‘she looks and sounds like Jenny Jones.’  Lol.  And it is Jenny Jones!
6 years later and still some of the best content.
I followed the directions exactly but my dough is a lot tougher and more dry than yours and I was afraid to add more milk because it wasn’t warmed up and the dough was already mixing. I’m new to baking 😬 it was hard to kneed so it’s resting now and I’m hoping it softens up once it relaxes. 🤞
Just tried this recipe.  Delicious! Thank you for sharing!
Jenny  show me how to make cheese bread
lmao that was entertaining and informative I love whole wheat bread so I can use this receipe instead of buying commercial made bread which may have a lot of ingredients for the preservatiion of the bread  moreover there's nothing like having fresh bread on your table. IMO

Tried this bred twice but it didn't raise only...very disappointed ☹️
You are so funny, did you have to take a shower after breaking the egg in your body. Too funny. Love your channel. I tried a different dutch oven bread recipe (8 hours in frig). Hated it, the crust came out too hard. My false teeth could not handle it lol. Love this bread. My husband keeps saying make "whole wheat", it is healthier. Now I found one.
I just made my bread, thank you for your recipe . Happy for my bread . Thank you , thank you , thank you
Can I skip sugar & egg?
That BIG tea Cup though 😉

You're a beautiful person Jenny you are a great host on TV and you're a greater host now..
Whats the substitute for milk ? Can i go without it ?
Thank  you for the great recipe....and the unexpected laughs!!! <3
Thank you for the great guide!  I was successful making the whole wheat bread!  One question that I want to know if I can cut out the sugar?
Just made a loaf of this bread…it’s heavenly and so easy to make!  We’re at 5000 feet in the Himalayas
OMG You're Jenny Jones! I knew the voice and you look amazing.  Please come back - I just discovered you. I used a "copycat" whole wheat bread recipe I found online and it turned out so horrible and cement-y that I can use it to build a foundation. This recipe looks wonderful. Going to try it now!
I make white bread but I don’t use eggs
Do I hv to use eggs ?
OH YOUR GETTING MARRIED , O.M.G. (SLAPS CHEST) FUNNY , VERY FUNNY . THANKS  STAY WELL
Jenny, you are hilarious n smiling always :) when you mentioned the different spatula you bought. Liked the way you demonstrate the bread making.
You are a riot lady!!!  But you are always fun to watch.
“Who’s your daddy”!!!  I love it!!!
Did you get those spatulas at Spatula City?  If you get that one, I luv ya.:)
it was 60 turns I kept counting while you started to talk
Looks delicious! Can you add seeds to this recire?
Well, holy moly, just scrolling around for a bread recipe (because I'm a bread baking newb), and Jenny Jones pops up, Hiya Jenny Jones, watched you every day on the show🐾...
You look amazing!!
I have made this recipe 2 times and was wonderful. Second time added  sunflower and fax seeds. Thanks.
Jenny where are you? 😭😭😭 You haven't posted a video in such a long time. I love all your recipes. Made this bread several times. Even my mom makes it now because it is so easy and so good. Thank you for giving us so many easy quick recipes. I hope you and your family are doing well ❤️
Fyi..NEVER add egg last.😢
She dont have enuf spatulas😏
👌👌👌👌👌👌
Love your tutorials thankyou
Thank you Jenny I tried your recipe and my bread came out perfect i tried others and I failed miserably yours was last time or never but yours will be forever I even sparked my doe 😁
Can I use Yorgut,  instead of yeast . Pls reply . Thku .
omg It took me a min to see who it was!!!!
This bread is amazing. Love how simple  her recipes are to follow. I will never eat store bought again. Thank you Jenny.
She is absolutely the best, down to earth, easy to understand, amusing (but not too much) and the bread came out perfectly! I have seen so many confusing, overly cute, pretentious and absurd bread baking videos on Youtube but this woman has it down.
35 minutes rising! Wow, your yeast is a lot better than the cr*p we have in New Zealand.
Ok that is delicious  I have been tryng to made homemade bread this came out perfect and I didn't let sit for 10 minutes I forgot I tried my hand mixer and it caught on fire so there's that
OMG 😱 YOU ARE THE BEST 😁👍🏻I love ❤️ your humor!
LOL reminds of how to warm your cold egg and where to put it but please no surprise 😂🤣🤣🤣..Happy viewer from Philippines
Great instructions! You sold me on 90 minutes  Your sure funny Thank you  Patricia 😊
Jenny you showed me how to make bread. It’s beautiful bread. Wow I didn’t know I could do this. Thank you so much 😊
Jenny thanks for posting this! It turned out really good! Adding the milk, white flour and egg really helped soften up this loaf. I hope your doing well in your retirement years and thanks again for teaching so  many of us how to cook and bake. You are a gem!!!!
I'm not doin' it, you can't make me!  I laughed out loud!
You crack me up Jenny! Hahahaha You are so positive and your videos are so much fun. Thanks for your inspiration and all the knowledge you impart on the rest of us :)
"You can't make me!".....Jenny you kill me! (spank that dough)
LOL
i like you!
You my lady are absolutely great!!!!!. I’m 60 and just started baking bread. Love from 🇬🇧 xxx
I really love this clip.
Who wouldn't love you...when you put that egg in yr hmm bra...who's yr daddy 🇦🇺
My dough came out too sticky. I think I have to use less milk
Jenny, your method of preparing your bread is so perfectly done. After kneading , you allow a ten minute rise, punch down, then a 30 minute rise and that's it !!!  There are no hours of rising and punching down the dough. Thank you.
Love your videos!!!😄
God I miss your recipes and your humor, sure wish you'd come back, many, many people miss these wonderful videos.
Whaaaaaat?! Jenny Jones?! I was just looking for a bread recipe and I found Jenny Jones! Cool! This is my bread video now. ("You're getting married??" - *CRUNCH* lol 😂)
Great recipe and well presented. Love her sense of humour.
I didn't know Jenny Jones had a you tube...I loved her back in the day!
😘
Love her presenting
This woman has MILLIONS of views on this ww bread;  and it only takes 90 mins.  Have GOT to try this!  Looks easy.
I love you Jenny! Can't stop laughing about the egg... 😆
Made this bread and I love it!!!
Lmao @ who’s your daddy. Omgggg hahahhaa
Thank you so much for this wonderful bread. Can you provide the measurements for 2 loaves please.  It will save me some time. Many thanks.
Should I use regular bake or convection bake in my gas oven?Thanks for the replies. I will use regular bake. Thanks!
Your so cute and recipes are simple to follow.
PLEASE come back to us! Even if you made a video once every 6 months... We miss you. 😢
Can this recipe be used to make white loaf just using all purpose flour ?
Ms. Jenny, I couldn't leave a comment at your site for some reason at the White Bread version of this recipe so I have to try to find it here on YT. I would just like to let you know I'm so thankful for the Lord that you put this recipe out. No kidding --- this is so life-changing especially for someone like me nowadays on hard times on a very limited budget. This is the first time I've ever made this kind of bread (I'm usually making those batter breads that for some reason turns out quite undercooked inside), and it came out so much more perfect than the store-bought ones. It was the right combo of crunch outside and softness inside, that even if it's a bit of work I think it will be a while before I buy any store bread again. Thank you so much!   And for reference I used some aerated high grade flour (I don't know how that's called in the US), only hand-kneaded. I may try out in the future ground flaxseed or chia seed as egg replacement (coz I happen to still have some lying around lol) and see how that turns out.
The best whole wheat loaf recipe that works. Thank you for sharing.
Thanks for posting this recipe. I tried twice and both of the times it turned out great. good rise, great taste, and fun to eat. I noticed this bread is somewhat crumbly, breaks easily compare to most wheat bread. is it supposed to be Crumbly or need more kneading. ( I am doing full hand kneading, no mixer)
I just did your recipe and I love it. I will never buy bread again. Thank You for making look simple
😂😂😂
HOW IS THIS A WHOLE WHEAT BREAD WHEN YOU ADD ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR IN IT?????
I would totally marry this woman
Oh, Jenny I love your channel!  You are my people...LOVE all your colored spatulas 👍🏻😂💜 My kitchen is full of colorful gadgets too!
I love you soooo much and I missed you
Hi Jenny, My dough is rising then flattening, and flattening more while baking. This has been happening only for a few months, since summer has started in India. Please advise.
Lol who's your daddy:) good job
3:56 “…who’s your daddy?” 😂🤣
I love her funnies!
Can I use coconut milk or coconut milk powder instead? If so, what's the ratio? Thank you!
Thank youuuu it worked perfectly 💪from the first time and it's clear well explained and easy to make
so can you use water instead of milk?
funny in last part😍😍😍
You're darn cute Jenny
I am still experimenting with breads. Somehow they  still don't sound right ☹😭😫😩😓😞😣😖
Who's your Daddy? Subscribed.
Thank you for sharing.I have subscribed.
I love how u make baking so much fun 🤣
priceless
I only have multi purpose flour, I don't have wheat flour.
People are want whole wheat bread are typically trying to avoid AP flour.
Tried the bread awesome it came out. Very easy and simple recipe my son loved the bread. Thank u for sharing the recipe
that was funny.
I'm your daddy
7:02 highlight of baking bread. thank me later.
Many thanks will give it another go
Hi Jenny just made the bread but it has come out very heavy and dense, hoping to make it a lighter fluffy loaf next time, any ideas ?
I love your videos and especially the unexpected humor thrown in .. makes being in the kitchen fun!
Jenny had a great talk show back in the day! So happy to see here again!
Really digging your vids and you are adorable. Thanks for making these.
Why the heck do you add sugar to the bread? I bet your husbands all got type 2 diabetes.
Thank you dear , we tried it today it was surely quick and easy and this was my first time loved it
Seems easy enough for a Neanderthal to make. Finally something I can make.
Would "Original Almond Milk" work?
I love you Jenny!!!! :)
❤️👍
Would a processor work?
Egg envy.
Egg in the recipe doesn’t feel right. Oh sod it im going to follow recipe. I’ll report back 👍
0:3:58

:58
You are too cute.
Hello Jen,  I have a 13x5,5x5 inch bread pan with lid (pullman bread pan). Any idea how to adjust the proportions and baking time??? Help...
Love her! More bread recipes please!!! For instance on the plain white bread recipe, can I use part rye  flour following the same format and will that still rise and be fluffy?
Scrunch the foil!!  What a concept!!  I made this bread, so easy!!  Warmed the egg in my shirt too...didn't crunch it though!!
i accidentally put 2 eggs instead of 1😭😭 I'm gonna be back when the break it's ready but I'm scared it turns out bad
Milk in a bread?
Why no new videos Jenny? This one is great!
Jenny:  Great video.  Entertaining and very easy to follow.  Made my first loaf today.  Crust was perfect (used the foil tent), great taste and the crumb was perfect.   Boy, howdy, did it rise when baking.  Thank you for sharing your skills and your recipe.  Looking forward to making many more but first I'm going to take a stab at making your Easy Crusty  No Knead Rolls.
I've been using your recipe for a while now.  I use a cup of ww flour, and a cup of white.  Also a half cup of rolled oats and a half cup of sunflower kernels.  And water instead of milk (I ran out of milk one time) and brown sugar.  So, yeah, I don't really use your recipe, but I do use your method.  It's fantastic; never fails.  Thank you so much.
Why didn't you cut the bread so we could see what it looks like?
Why milk instead of water?
Hahaha
that is not whole wheat
awesome jenny's bread all and i really miss her😢
No one is saying if the recipe works😂 I'll try it and tell you😉 with all honesty it's not the best
It is really simple if it takes so much kneading! LOL
Just subscribed to your channel my wife loves me cooking since I’ve been retired, thanks 🙏
Thanks for sharing, I love your style
Made twice and a family member made so easy and good!, thanks
Omg, I jumped when she crushed that egg,  hilarious 😆
Y did u stop doing the YouTube videos...I want to watch u🙁🙁🙁
I’ve watched Jenny a couple times but it didn’t hit me until now!  I KNEW her from somewhere!  Now I know!  Her talk show!!  You rock, Jenny!
Why do you need to use your hands.? Your machine should be good for all this kneeding.
Omg Jenny ...🤣... thanks..., next project 👍
This recipe came out really good!!!
Thank you Jenny for your great recipe. I just used your recipe to make the bread. It was great  👍👍👍👍👍  But I ended up with adding 3/4 cups of bread flour more because the dough was too soggy to knead. It may be because of humidity at my town. Also I did add some of the pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and sesame seeds into the dough to become a healthier version. All in all, the result was very satisfied!! Thank you so much again. I enjoyed watching your vdo too. Love it!
Well Jenny I'm back to check this bread out of most white flour so I will make this one today. Hope you are doing well Thank you, Jenny.
I made this bread today and added sunflower seed to the batter.  It turned out great!  I don't have a stand mixer, so I did it all by hand and it was easy.  Thanks Jenny
Thank you for this simple and easy whole wheat bread recipe. I'm able to do this without a mixer coz I don't have one.
I'm going to try this recipe today, but I think I just found my "New Favorite" person to follow. You are too funny and I love it.
Lol.. who is your daddy😂
Clean up between isles 1&2..... I was like oh snap don’t say it as to where to put the egg to warm it up. Jenny, you almost go me...... lmao
🤣 Spank that dough. Who’s your Daddy🤣
Love this, made it today. Simple quick and delicious.
OMG,  Jenny girl is one of the sweetest people I've come to know.  She's funny,  truthful (right to the point in her own way of thinking) How could we not love you Jenny.  Thanks for all your great and much easier recipes....
D
tri
I love Jenny 🥰
This is a great recipe!!
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny! I made the whole wheat bread today and it's the FIRST time I haven't ended up with a heavy brick. :) (I bake a lot of white and multi-grain breads to perfection, but have always struggled with whole wheat) I am watching what I eat, so used ONLY whole wheat flour and beating it in the KitchenAid on high did the trick. It rose SO quickly, I was shocked. I had to get the oven turned on so it wouldn't hit the ceiling of the kitchen. LOL This will be my go-to whole wheat from now on. BRAVO!!!
It’s easier if you have cleavage! 😂
Nice
Hahaha.  Spanking
You could use her egg method lol, or put it in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes. I have done this many times.
👍
You don't need the sugar or milk, its not cake?
I found her today and it's amazing! I don't know why she stopped doing her videos 😢🥺
😂😂🧡
Lol
I  tried this recipe..bread was amazing. Thank you for the recipe. I want to know if I do the first proofing for 30 minutes ,will that make a difference. Also I wanted to know why my bread does not rise in the oven like you say in the recipe.
What does she mean when she says "Who's your daddy"?
Made the bread today. Worked out perfect and was very easy to make.
No mistake bread, be easy on the sugar if you do not like it sweet like me. Cheers!
Jenny, I tried your recipe to the letter and as you did it in the video and the result was an absolute failure.
You’re funny
You are hilarious!!
Where is your recipe for your loaf white bread. I love it. But cant find it. Thank you
Your so funny  🤣
LOVE that little kitchen aid mixer Timer you have!!!! So freakin cute!  Great loaf of bread!
Please cut the bread, want to see how it looks!
How long can it last
Ok !! So who’s your daddy, Jenny!! 🥰.. you are simply adorable..!!🌷🌷🦋🦋🌺🌺🧚🧚🧚🧚
What about could you try using a flute free flour. ?..please
Egg and milk!!!!!!!!! Should be in title so we dont click
Whose your daddy?  LOLOLOL!!!!!
buahahaha she cracks me up! I subscribed after "whose your daddy" lol
The video have laughing everyone. Jenny is too sweet
If I use my kneading attachment on my mixer, how long should I leave it in the mixer?  Thanks
I like you❤️Your Crazy-Old Granny Cole❤️
I watched a documentary on her - she began her career as a comedian...also a musician and a talk show host.  She has worked her ass off.
Wow 😳 colourful utensils
So could i bake it round in my dutch oven?
😄😄😄
Can I double it?
I have a silly question.  How can a bread be whole wheat bread when one also uses all purpose or bread flour to accompany whole wheat flour?
Your addiction is buying plastic spoons,my addiction is plastics bowls. I'm driving my husband crazy.hahahaha funny!
*Who's your daddy* 3:57
who's ur daddy??? Didn't expect that!!😂😂😂😂😂 Love u Jenny😘  Hahahahahaahahahaaaaaaaaàaaaa
Love her sense of humour. I am making her bread right now and it seems like it's not rising. I wouldn't suggest using a hand mixer as it is too hard on it. I bought her cook book and I am disappointed that it doesn't have this bread recipe or Any of her Utube recipes. Her spare ribs were phenomenal as well as her cabbage and beet soup  She's a great cook. Where's her daddy????
Jenny you are wonderful.  I've been struggling with learning how to cook for a few months,  I can't afford to throw out my gastronomic disasters, some are awful, some have no eye appeal, but all get eaten.......Today I succeeded in making your whole wheat bread, perfect, properly risen, great taste. After so many failures I was just about to give up trying.........you came to my rescue.  Maybe I'm its daddy.
I made this bread today and it turned out really good.
Jenny you know I do not like kneading.
Awesome recipe.... my loaf puffed up so much it hit the oven rack above it. I wish I could post pictures...
I love her so much! She is so funny and I love her recipes.
What's the  Dimension of the Loaf Tin  L ×B×H
Hahahahah...thanks, you made my day
If I want to put honey in my bread, where in the process should I put it in?
Hello, can I use hard red wheat flour mix with all purpose flour?
That paddle on mixer is usually for cakes you need a kneading hook for kneading bread.
I made something I did not think possible. I was going to make your bread, but no whole wheat flower, so I thought, ok, white it is.  At the proofing stage I congratulated myself, it was looking perfect. And the I noticed my flower - I used self raising. All my stuff was still sitting out, so I made a new bread with my bread flower. I could not throw the other dough mix out, so I decided to keep it and see what happens.  I can now declare that you can use self raising flower in conjunction with yeast, and the bread was only slightly smaller than the other one.  No difference in taste. Result.
Why isn’t this lady “a breath of fresh air” I may add not on British tv to replace the over exposed cooking rubbish that’s on at the moment. Come on guys it’s time to get rid of these people that we have to endure every Saturday morning, I think you know who I mean . False laughter, excruciating chatter and boring celebrities that really don’t want to be there . Means to an end I suppose?
You go girl, spank that dough
So excited to have found you! You’re so much fun to watch and your recipes look great, too!!
You just made my day! You are hilarious! Can't wait to try this bread recipe! Thank you!
Jenny You are the BEST!!! Your recipes are so simple and the product comes out great every time.  You rock!!!
Jenny, will you marry me please?
I love this lady. ;)
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣you are hilarious!!!
3:56
Can I bake 2 loaves at the same time? Any change in cooking time?
I just got a convection oven. Wanted a simple enough recipe to experiment. Walked into a dominatrix spanking bread dough XD
Thanks Jenny, I am going to get Me some whole wheat flour tomorrow!
Jenny’s a freak. I always knew that
Can I substitute the milk with almond milk?
where did you get your gloves or oven mits
I'm a guy, I don't cook. I tried this and it worked exactly like she said.
where did you get all the bright spatulas and work surface?  I need that color in my life.
Superwoman! Xxx
Are u single I love bread 😩
And you didn't slice it and show us inside  :(
I love this channel! Hilarious and clear, easy to follow instructions. I came to this video after watching her cinnamon roll video where she starts by saying “you’re going to love my buns”. The egg in the cleavage was the cherry on top 😂😂
Great video! I've never tried the egg or milk; looking forward to adding those in next time. How essential is the white flour? I'm trying to get better at my 100% whole wheat loaves.
We can make bread only with all purpose flour as well please answer me thanks
FABULOUS! I just made this recipe today, and I am amazed how well it turned out. I served it with homemade chicken rice soup, and it was a great hit! Unfortunately, I could not  find white whole wheat flour at the store when I shopped, so I had to use regular whole wheat flour. Despite that, the flavor and texture of this bread in an 8x5 pan were great with a high rise and a moist fluffy crumb, fluffy for a whole grain flour. Your online recipe, suggested an 8x5 pan, so I stayed with that. The video was a tremendous help. I also used honey 1:1 for the sugar and brushed on an egg wash. This will be great for sandwiches too. Jenny, do you have a similar recipe for white bread, or should we just reverse the amounts of bread flour and whole wheat? I did use bread flour as it has a higher protein level than AP. I find bread flour works better with whole wheat flour than does AP. Thank you so much! I will be using this recipe again. I will most likely use it for dinner rolls too.
Should have said who’s your mommy 😂
35 minutes did not nearly cause my dough to rise enough. Try at least DOUBLE that amount of time
Do you think you could make a gluten free delicious bread? Love your channel!
3rd loaf for me. I love it! Thank you!
It's the same with white Bread
Crap. Love it.
Jenny i like your recipe but substitute of egg in this recipe please  you can told
Could you use all bread flour or all plain flour?
I haven't looked in on Jenny in awhile, for no real reason - she wasn't coming up in any recipe searches I was doing. But I always liked her upbeat, friendly manner. But she's hilarious in this video, while still giving excellent, clear instructions. This recipe looks terrific - will try it soon. Great, Jenny!
Can I omit the sugar?
Why do you use the paddle instead of a dough hook?
Whos here because of minecraft
Omg 😱 i made it as  the recipe is! It was actually very delicious and like professionals😃😃thanks alot
Ok...your hilarious! You are a great teacher.
jenny i just love you so much i use to watch your talk show wonder what ever happen to that oh well you make me smile
🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂 how the fuck did I not know about this channel til now?!
my guess is that you've got the old J type hook for your dough hook. kitchenaid has a spiral hook now that kneads dough so much better!
Who is your dzaddy😂😂😂😂
She makes baking looks so easy......
Jenny, i had a big crush on back in the day, are you married?
I was smiling the whole time watching this video haha
And I'm using one of my ✨NEW SPATULAS!✨🤣🍞
I dont have a thermometer  thing 😐 . How do i know the temp  of boiling milk?
Made this recipe. It turned out great!
The ending omg ...lmao she's a riot!
Love her!  I think she had a local television show in Wichita, Kansas.
can you use buttermilk instead of milk and if so do I need to add some baking soda?
TQ Jenny, tried the above recipe the bread turned out perfect!
My only problem: I eat all the bread I make.  Yes, really.
im bout to make bread today after it turn out i want buy no more bread im finna be like you lol thanks
How many grams of flour in one of Jenny’s cups ?
Soon as I saw you I remembered your tv show.. you are a smart, fun, beautiful lady! Sorry it took so long for me to find you on here!
Nice lady ... friendly and fun.. she would be a AWESOME wife!
This video needs more spatulas!
Totally hilarious. I love her cooking. Jenny you rock.
just made these and they turned out perfect! try it guys, it's delicious. I added an extra 1 Tbs for sugar.
Once sugar is added into the bread mix, It ain't healthy anymore!!
A little orange juice helps the bitter taste some people experience.
I put the egg inside my Fly, then forgot about it being there for the following 8 hours!
I can now make beautiful, yummy bread! SO excited, thank you Jenny! I love your channel! I would love to add the photo I just took of it, but dont see how.
Back at it. First one was great.
Amazing... But what is replacement for Egg mam....
Well all I can say is my first attempt was a FAIL!   I did everything by the book,, temped the milk to 120,, used fresh yeast,, and followed this recipe to the tee.. BUT the loaf never really rose in the 9x5 UN-GREASED pan.  I believe that is why!! The dough adhered itself to the sides.  I had one heck of a time just betting it out of the pan and the bottom was fastened so bad it came off t he loaf. I really think the pan has to be coated with oil.  The loaf never got that "1 inch rise over the sides of the pan". and during the baking cycle it did not rise at all. ??????   Try and try again... I'll try this one more time and if it comes out the same way.. this recipe goes into the garbage bin. I hppe it works next time around.  I am clueless why this did not come out right! I did use my Kitchen Aid mixer as prescribed.  The first rising was a great success so I am sticking with the idea that un-greased pan caused the dough to not rise properly.  What else could it be?
Omgoodness I remember Jenny. you look great Like you never aged a bit.
Haha! “Who’s your daddy lmao!! “
Hi Jenny, I just came across your channel and loved it!  You are hilarious.🤣  I wanted to make the bread using whole wheat flour only.  I was also wondering if you placed the bread on the middle rack.  My oven has 6 different rack settings.  Thank you!😍  Greetings from Montreal, Québec, 🇨🇦
That was hilarious...thanks for making bread baking so much fun!
All I wanted was a bread recipe, but I got so much more.
Are you married Jenny? if not I'll buy you all the spatulas you want if you move in with me and bake bread every day.
Is this appilcable to oat?
Jenny, your amazing and funnyyyyyyy  we all love you, thanks for all the great recipes, your baby back ribs fall off the bone was superb, I made them right, but I had nobody saying "I love you" to the ribs LOL
I love the way you show us you are so cool thank you much
What a fun video!  I risk being called a party-pooper, but if you use all-purpose flour, the bread isn't "whole wheat" anymore. (Regardless, I'm sure the all-purpose flour adds more loft.)
I made the Whole Wheat Bread, and it is good soft and good.  I  don't have a mixer, but kneaded it by hand.  I love it, and  will use this recipe often.  Next time I will double it to make two loaves.  Also I like the timer you used, of a mixer.  I would like to buy one like that.  Have a Very    Merry Christmas.
Just made this---just had a slice, hot & fresh.....fabulous!
I wish she'd cut into the bread to show the  texture
Heating up her egg in the cleavage 🤣
Thank you for this recipe! Would you tell the amount of flour in grams and milk in liters please? I'm from other country and we haven't american cups.
hilarious! I bet you were damn gorgeous when you were young! Love you and your simple recipe! Perfect for home makers like us who dont have time for complications haha
.
jenny is soo funny i love how quick and easy and fuss free her recipes are but i just love watching her bc shes so entertaining
lol. i enjoyed watching you
i miss you jenny! hope you are doing well. pls come back to youtube!
That last part cracked me up!😂😂😂 Great video 💯😊
So funny!
That is not kneading.
This is why you don’t judge a book by its cover... thanks Jenny! ;)
Ha ha lol the ending that’s courage, industriousness! Traits I love.
You make me laugh.
Just made this loaf.  It looks devine. And didnt grease the pan like you said.  but now its stuck on the bottom  . Oh dear.
Everything about this video is wrong and all your subscribers are morons! P.S., your spatula collection sucks!
I made this bread and turned out great.  Was great 1st day but was dry the next day.  Yes I  stored in a zip log bag.  Appreciate comments why my bread was dry,
Thank you so much for this recipe. I've made it twice so far...both times came out brilliantly. My family and I  loved it!
An egg in bread?  No!
Can we make without egg?
👏👏👏❤️
Lol..your hilarious..thanks for sharing the recipe
Just came across this video..omg when she said "Who's your daddy!" I was like "whaaaatt" 😆 🤣 😂 Jenny Jones ur my kinda gal....😉👍💯
Surprised a dough hook doesn’t work for you. We bought a kitchenaid just to kneed dough. Works fine for us so far.
Hi!!😊 Great Recipe!! Can I replace the egg with flax egg? Thanks💖
I love your nail polish shade! And everything else in the video! She’s such a lovely personality! ❤️
Can I do it without the egg?
"who's your daddy" loved it. subscribed.
I just make one, OMG can’t believe my eye that I can make a loaf like this. Thank you so much to share your recipe. I can’t believe it’s so easy that much. Thanks again
Jenny would by all means be a Keeper
You are hilarious!! It's easier when you've got cleavage 😂😂😂
are you using convect
I love your matching hair thing, just makes you so damn cute! Thanks for your videos
Hahahaha great video!
I love my Kitchenaid Mixure. The Dough Hook works great for me.
This lady is hilarious lmao. Loved it when she smacked the bread and said "Who's your daddy!"
Thanks
You are so cute! Thank you so much for sharing! My husband just recently asked me if I can bake white bread. I'm going to bake it this weekend. Thank you again.
"What can you do that's exciting in 15 minutes, with your clothes on?"  LOL  Crack an egg in your cleavage?
You are funny
Thank you for sharing the recipe
That whole wheat bread is such a good looking healthy baby 🐈😍😋
Lol....your so funny to put egg inside....😂🤣😂🤣😂
Jenny’s da best!
The bread did not rise it was about 40 mins I did exactly as the recipe said warm milk egg at room temp and 2 tsp yeast. I just made white bread yesterday  as was the yeast was fine. What was my problem?
Just found her, you are hilarious lady. New fan here. 👌😂
My wife tried the recipe. it didn't work for us. Yeast didn't mix at all in the stand mixer and milk ratio was less to create a soft dough.
On your recipe you stated that you should aerat th flour. Just stir? Or sift?
Caution: New baker here, saw that Jenny used a whole package of fleshman's yeast. I bought similar looking packages, but discovered that it contains 21g not the stated 7g. Caught it at the last moment. First time bread turned out gggggreat!. Makes the best sandwich I ever had.
🤣🤣🤣
Love you, but how about a vegan bread, why cow milk and egg, that is not the truth way for thousands of years to make bread. Billions  Of loafs a month are baked around the world with out animal products. Stop the inhumanity Jenny, eggs and milk are not humane ways of cooking, love you still.
Any kind of oil is OK ..... 10W30😅🤣😂😋
I made this bread today, it was good, hardy, and filling bread. Turned out just like yours. Mildly soft. Thank you for sharing.
Can you use all bread flour instead of wheat?
Jenny, thanks for sharing your recipe. Can we use this for white bread instead of whe wheat? Thanks :)
First time seeing this woman and I already love her😂😂😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Why doesn’t mine rise?? The yeast is active, the milk is warm.......
Please Jenny will be pleased if you can text me recipe for Hotcross Buns ,like your recipe for Cinnamon Buns ,came out very yummy 😋
WTF is 120 Degrees FAHRENHEIT?  thought we are living in the 21st century and using international measures for international YouTube Videos??  Pls use CELSIUS or at least both in future  +-0 Degrees Celsius  = ICE  +100 Degrees Celsius boiling or cooking water  - your body temperature between 36-37 Celsius .. trust me its not Rocket science....even if everybody in Rocket Science using this international standards and the Metric system which is based on 10 because everybody has 10fingers usually.  sry nice receipy but thumbs down for Fahrenheit
I made it today, it turned out perfect. Super delicious. Made the dough with my food processor and my sister also made it with hand mixer. Both were great
Can i not use egg? Tq
Omg you're hilarious!!
In the end!!!!!🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍🎉
😂😂😂😂😂
That doesn't seem to be whole wheat flour. That looks too white.
By far the best wheat bread recipe that i found easy to make n you're funny Thanks🙂
lol you're hysterical! so colorful in many ways....well done.
Great simple recipe thanks
You remind me of  Doris Day with your jokes.  Thank you, stay safe!
You're a hoot. Good stuff. Tell me that egg was hard boiled..lol
Can anyone tell me how much milk has really been added? It looks more like 1.5 or 2 cups...
Mrs Jenny is so naughty..in all her videos 😘
😂thank you for making me laugh
😂😅. I can hardly wait to try the bread
Hi Jenny, l tryout this recipe and turn out too dense and top of the bread shrunk after bread remove from the oven .and can I  have you convert cup of the flour to Gram.Thank you.
If you never caught her shows... she has a fabulous since of humor. Love our Jenny Jones.
I love this recipe so muchhh
OMG Luv You, you are funny. =)~
Thanks so much Jenny. Thee bread was perfect . I love your recipes. Love from SriLanka
Love everything you make.♥️
I tried this bread recipe but used regular yeast that was not outdated. After 2 hours, it still did not rise as instructed. The only thing I may have done different is I didn’t mix for 2 minutes. The dough was. Dry firm/ dry. Ant suggestions?
The yolks on you Jenny!
"Whos your daddy" was an interesting bit :)  unexpected but lovely humour.   reminded of the friends' episode with Phoebe and Ross
Where is she now?  She's not posting new recipes 😒
You play squash with two balls and they have to be warm.  To warm them we usually just bat the balls at the walls until warm - can take up to 15 minutes.  To save time I used to put both balls into my cleavage (I have a lot of cleavage - no I'm not bragging).  Only took about five minutes to heat up.  Got more time to play that way.
Can I use  " POWDERED EGG Substitute " ?? { NO other kind of substitute }   allergy !!!!!!!!!
Thank you. My bread looks delicious.
she always spanks her dough and says "who's your daddy"
Thanks so much.God bless you +
Can I make it without a blender?
Oh you are so funny 😂 thanks 🙏🏻 a lot and stay beautiful in Christ Jesus. Amen 👏🏼
U r so cute 🥰
Jenny... You are too dang funny!!!  haha
Thank you, you are amazing!
You are funny!
Tried ur recipe and it came out well. Thanks
She is funny 😁. Great .
I made this today for my son and I. This bread is great! Perfect for a beginner like myself! I tried to warm up the egg like you suggested, but it just fell onto the floor, unfortunately. 😪
You are funny your end of the video egg part made me smile...will try your recipe only will have to use my hand as I don’t have that stand  blender
한국어로 볼 수 있게 해주세요
You are kinda funny
🤣🤣🤣
Did not work for me 😥
Jen you rock. Love your videos
Please be a guest on the drew Barrymore show. You've paved the way!! 🌈❤️
Where is Jenny with new recipes?
You can also warm up a cold egg in a cup of warm tap water for a five mins. or so. No accidental breakage!
Hey Jenny ! what can we use instead of an egg if are running out of eggs ? By the way, love you and your recipes  :)
Actually, it doesn't matter which side of the aluminium foil is facing the bread. The color difference between the sides is simply a result of the manufacturing process, and doesn't play any role in, or has any affect on the cooking process.
Super mom I'm thamil naato sey hi
Could I substitute the flours for gluten-free flours?
can you leave the egg out
How long do we bake??? And how to check if the bread is baked properly or not???
I'm totally addicted to your videos. Wonderful easy recipes . Who needs Heston or  Gordon!!!!!
Baked my first bread using your receipie during the pandemic. Thanks!
What happened to you? Why don't you upload videos anymore?
If you're putting AP flour in it's not whole wheat, is it?
Is it normal my homemade bread smell like yeasty/ alcohol?
I love your demo, you make it not just informative but enjoyable as well ...great !  thanks
I've made this bread a few times and while it does come together as easily as shown, it's not very good.  It looks nice and the crust is great, but the crumb leaves something to be desired.  Thirty-five minutes for the rise just isn't enough time for the gluten structure to develop, and so you're left with a very crumbly bread.  It's doesn't have that nice chewy texture you expect inside a slice of bread.  Next time I make this, I'm going to autolyse the dough for an hour and then mix the yeast in and do a series of stretch/fold/rises like you would for sourdough to see if I can get a better gluten structure to develop
You're adorable. Thanks for the recipe.
You are so funny! Love your style!! That hair band is sssso cute!😍
I’m so sad you stopped making videos. I love your recipes and personality!
Hi, I made this bread it turned out good. Thank you for delicious recipe. I just have2 questions: 1. If using active yeast(Not Instant) do I need to activate it? I did that once like added yeast first with milk and honey and left for 15 mins, but that one got slightly yeast smell to bread 2. I want to add flex meal and sunflower seeds to bread. When should I add them in the process.
Is there a list of ingredients here?
OK this lady is funny!
I love the bread - but 35 minutes rise time??!! I've made the recipe at least 10 times now, and it takes at least 1:15 - 1:45 to rise to an inch above loaf pan. It's a great bread and damn easy yo make!!!
1 can I use water in place of milk?  2 Can I just omit the egg and oil?
Hey jen I love your shows. Only wanted to know if I could make this in a microwave.. Would be much obliged if you could reply.
Thank you for sharing! Will try this recipe! 😍
Love & miss our Jenny! 💖👍
I just baked this and couldn't stop eating it. The whole house is filled with the aroma. It's simply the best! Thank you so much.
I love her recipient, my bread looks great, just not sure if I have to let it cool to eat after I take it out of the oven LOL
I made a loaf with this recipe. It was easy to make n so good to eat. I replaced 20g of wholemeal flour with wholegrain flour to give it a little crunch. Very yummy. Thank you for sharing!
Thank you so much for this perfect recipe ❤ it turned out amazing!!
Hi Jeanne if u have good potato bread can u share on u tube please
I made this bread again today for probably the 10th time this year.  I have never before baked bread.  I am so grateful for this video and recipe.  Today I was confident enough to split the dough up into approx 12 rolls and bake them off as dinner rolls.  Hope it works!  (2.25 oz per roll).
hhhhhhh so cutie !!!
Made me laugh so hard, was not expecting spanking,  who is your daddy and  the final breast crush, you  are hilarious yet exciting
Hi!!! I tried your recipe. It was easy. Well explained. But my bread didn’t get completely baked. It was a little wet in the centre. I don’t know why. But I followed every step exactly the same. Please tel me what would have gone wrong. Temp? Time??? Whatttt?
Hi. Can I use butter instead of oil?
Hi mem .is it okay to omit egg  ,the bread looks so yummy 😋 well done
Thank you. Love this
Why a bread sometimes breaks up
Do you know which cracked wheat is best for breads ?  I see various options:  fine, medium, and coarse.  I don’t know which to get !!
Terribly sorry but, I like to use butter for my Fat. It tastes so good!!!
Just wanna know if the whole wheat flour used is fine or course?
You made me laugh! I'm so gonna try making this in 2 days
Come back!!!!!!!!!
this is my second time making this bread.  easy and delicious
Omg! You are hilarious! Thank you for the recipe. 😂😂😂
Can’t we put yeast into the warm milk ? Does it make any difference
You are DARLING! Where did u buy that Needingboard/ Cuttingboard?  Thx,  dUg- George John & Ringo... (My name is Doug George)
excited to try this this weekend!
“Who’s your daddy?” OMG didn’t see that spanking coming. Laughing so hard 🤣 Man, that egg surprise. Gosh, love her 😂
Remember this recipe by heart now. Everytime comes out perfect. Thanks, Jenny!
It came our perfectly. Thank you for sharing your recipe.
I can't believe you didn't cut the bread.
Why is it only a “one rise” bread?  Is it not necessary to rise breads twice?  I am confused but I love Jenny!!
"WHO'S YOUR DADDY?!?!?"
I used a glass pan and perhaps that's why the crust got a bit hard and brown... but the inside is wonderfully soft!! This was my very first attempt at baking with yeast. Thank you for the recipe!
Hi Jenny, i did these bread before and was great. Now i am leaving at high altitude . What oven temperature should i bake these bread? Thank you.
You’ve got a “quick bread” video. While you made it, you commented  we can use ANY kind of flour (and added you love using whole wheat flour). But in this one you use different ingredients: sugar, olive oil and an addition of regular flour.  I used 3 cups of whole wheat flour, and found that 1 1/2 cups of water wasn’t enough to create the right dough consistency. After baking it, it came out rather “dense” and heavy in texture.  Was that because of my not using only whole wheat flour? Also, in the “quick recipe” you used 1/4 tsp of yeast, but in this one you used the WHOLE ENVELOPE? Why?  My wife is diabetic and can’t have regular flour or ANY sugar. Can whole wheat bread be made without sugars or bread flour?
Did you mill your flour, or is this commercially available “whole wheat” flour?
I love, love your cooking show! Not only are your recipes terrific but you are hilarious! We all need to laugh every day. cheers
I love your love of spatulas
loved ur humour😂
Sen one for me please
Does anyone know how to adjust for altitude? I am at about 4300ft and I'd like to try the recipe!
Dear  thank you so much.
Cannot see anyone who may have asked this question already :  As vegetarian, could I sub a "flax-egg" for the "chicken-egg"?
Don't you have to oil the pan and the top?
do I grease a glass loaf pan?
Bismillah... I don't have bread mixer 😭
Omg! this video was super fun to watch, Who's your Daddy?
Are you vegan
How can I sent you my bread pics
Can room temperature Butter be used instead of oil. If yes what quantity
the ending 😂😂😂😂 can I add seeds and grains to the dough?
It’s not rising 😭 awww well  🤷‍♂️  story of my life lol 😉
Hi Jenny, thanks for your receipt. I am running into an issue, that the dough shrinks so quick before I put it into the oven and it does not spring back during baking. Am I doing anything wrong?
your kneading paddles revolt!  I'm always mystified by the dough hook, it just collects the dough and spins it around  :-)
Bread came out perfect! Thanks a bunch for the recipe
Can you add walnuts into it?
I love your videos.  They are funny and I learn something!
Hi I tried...but it did not rise even after 30 minutes and the bread turned out very hard...what could have gone wrong?
This is by far the best recipe for bread, not too stiff not too fluffy, tks for sharing
Nice job thxs alot... May i keep only on using whole bread flour not white fliur?
Looks so good!
Just made the bread it smells and looks amazing, I put a tray with water in the oven while it was baking and I guess it’s a good trick !
Love your recipes! Question, can I substitute honey for the sugar and if so, would it be the same amount?
You'd make a great civil engineer - your trick with the foil!
2 cup how many gr.. Thank u dear..
You are so funny.  I love your sense of humor!
I love it how she was so excited ab her new spatulas🥺🥺
My bread doesn't turn brown why
lolol  the end bit
I made this bread today using both all purpose and wheat flour i didn't use milk i used water,  linseed instead of egg  and it came out perfect nice and soft on the inside
Hahaha...you funny..😉😉😉..whose your Daddy..😄😄😄
Looks good in from Mumbai India I don't have an Elec bread mixie can you show how to make manually. Btw why is bread kneaded into a sticky dough
so how much is 2 cups ( 500 gms?)
I love her 😍 Subtle humor is the funniest
Gawd I so love your shows!  Love from New Zealand:)
JENNY, love this bread really enjoy you, and I would recommend your pie dough recipe to my friends , good on ya girl
Why would anyone dislike this video ???
Thanks for sharing such a easy bread recipe
Going to make this bread !
I do hope that this recipe is better when I say this you can get recipes all day long but people that sat there and yep their mouth the whole time through it talk about ship that doesn't even apply to making bread or a chicken or anyting I don't get everybody wants to be a star where you're not maybe in your own home but just threw the recipe and cook it and be done with it I won't watch it I will cut it off every time I don't have the patience for all the drama
We tried baking Jenny's whole wheat bread for the first time and it was a sure perfect recipe. Everything about was awesome. Thanks Jenny.
Superb presentation 👌👏👍💞
Jenny, we miss your videos and recipes, have you stopped cooking? Where are you???
I made this bread 2x now, and both times it came out perfect, and I am not a bread maker. I also made her one layer chocolate cake, and yum yum!
She was engaging and hysterical.  Love her baking method and very instructive .  So going to use this method.
I use bier instead of yeast and milk and water. It's good too. That's real ale. I also use old ally meat tins.
I made your Wheat bread and it came out delicious and beautiful. If you get this, please post more recipes.
😂😂😂😂 nice one
Sweet sweet lady   Beautiful attitude
Looove your recipes!!!! I also miss you on TV!! Could I freeze this bread? Thank you  Be safe
Loved the video, watching from India
You’re Amazing.    Tnx   Very lovely Lady 🌹
that ending was everything haha <3
Best website on the internet.  Short, sweet and to the point.  Thanks Jenny.  You're the best!
Hahahahaha the egg in the end. Perfect & easy
Why do non Indian people feel its necessary to add egg in everything.... duhhhhh get over it already
Need that egg at “room” temperature.....
Thanks for the recipe ,It came very nice ,can I avoid egg ,?? if so, Please let me know if any thing else have  to be added  more?
Thanks a bunch.I have got to know how to make bread so easily and I dont ever go to the shop for buying bread!! Thank you again.
You're hilarious! Haha
Oh my gosh I love you!
I need the fan of the oven on or just put it on heat?
can i prepare this bread with same procedure but with all purpose flour?
I love this lady. Her humor makes it's light and easy, she keeps you engaged. Definitely, she makes baking bread look like a walk on the park.
OMG I love your spatulas
Ok I love you! Subscribed. Just tried this with spelt instead of all purpose and it came out great!
I just tried to make this bread.  I followed the recipe and the method.  The milk and egg were warm.  It did not rise at all.  A half hour, an hour, then two, then three, and no rising.  I checked the yeast - it was not outdated at all.  I am disgusted.  I had to bake it, but it is basically a dense cracker, though not krispy.  What a waste.  I have to look for another recipe, I guess.
I really like to watch your teaching.  You made me laugh,  that what I need in this time of days.  You are funny.  I will try to make your recipe.  Will going to be my first time.
What could I use instead of the egg?
I wished you still taping shows., your funny and like your recipes
why did u use paddle
Is it okay if the milk is not heated
Can we omit egg ? Or add something vegetarian?
I wanted to see her slice into that loaf. Dibs on the heel!
Easy peasy thank you so much for this easy bread recipe really enjoy your videos thanks a bunch 😋
I find baking at 350 degrees for 30 minutes is the perfect time and I don't have to cover it.  It's golden brown and perfectly done.
you are so funny, l love you
in italiano
I made this bread it cane out fantastic. 👌🏿I made a little adjustment and added flax seed powder. 1 cup..while wheat flour 1 cup. Awesome 👍😁 Thank you Jenny!
I’m making this loaf today...fingers crossed...I had to take a double take when I started watching your video...I watched u when u had your talk show back in the day...u haven’t changed a bit!
Any substitute of yeast?
The ratios are quite wrong with this recipe. I think you're using very packed flour. I got a very unwieldy sticky dough that took a lot of extra flour to fix
Dear Miss Jenny. It's me again. Practice make perfect. Now the bread I make is consistent and delicious. Thank You so much for this recipe. Wonderful.
OMG You crack me up! (Yes, pun intended!)
Please the measurement again...thank you
Need to spray the pan before baking. Hard getting out of the pan. Other than that...good bread.
Baked my very first 🍞  it turned out to be amaze.. also I totally forgot about the spanking part before but when I looked at that high risen bread dough, she asked for it..
Can I make eggless
How many grams of yeast?  Substitute for egg?
Can you suggest substitute for egg?
Can you suggest substitute for egg?
Try this bread tonite...super easy and soft...thank you Jenny!
Thoroughly entertained & educated... Thanks for the chuckles & easy how to...
I made the wheat bread and it’s so easy and delicious! Thanks Jenny!
This is an amazing recipe!! Tried and loved!! Thank you 🙏🏼
Can you use all purpose white flour for regular bread?
Awesome.... tried and tested so fast and so tasty👍🏻 my family love this bread
That was a surprise ending 😅
fantastic
I have tried many whole wheat bread recipes and this one is the best ever!
My bread did not rise like that 😞
You know what's missing here??, Matching apron !!,Love  her tutorials ,whether I make or not ,she's cute!
Can confirm this bread recipe is amazing!!! Thank you Jenny! I won’t be buying bread anymore.
great recipe, thank you! You make it look so simple.
so in order to warm up my egg, I put it in my pocket, and then promptly forgot to put it in the dough, so I cracked it and kneeded it in as best I could. The dough got real sticky so I added a little flour. Turned out ok, maybe next time I'll do it right. lol
What should we do  Of our dough become hard?? Tell me please?? Immediately
Jenny I loved to watch you videos.. Specially wheat bread.. I have tried it today. Just waiting to cut... You are so witty and fun loving... Thank you
I love this lady.
Please upload more videosssss thank you!!!
I really appreciate it. I baked it and It was perfect 👌
This is the best whole wheat bread we have made! We now makes sure it is always there in our freezer! And it disappears at an amazing pace from the box! Thanks Jenny! You are the Daddy! We made buns out of the same dough and they turned out super delicious too. Made 8 balls of 100 gms each, set in tray, 3" apart, flattened the balls slightly, 35 minutes proof. Basted with milk, baked at 185°C for 20 minutes, removed and brushed with butter.
Hi Jenny, if I want to do 'white' bread, what type of flour can I use? I am a new friend and new new baker
I followed the recipe to the letter. It worked, but I suggest to grease the pan or use baking parchment. Mine stuck to the bottom and broke the lower part upon removing from the pan. Excellent otherwise. Thank you Ma’am
*spanking the dough*  "Who's your daddy?"  Me: I hate my mind.
What's the alternative to the tin foil tent part?
Thank God, the bread dough didnt replied, choke me daddy 😂. Jokes apart, many thanks for the recipe! Saves our life in lockdown.
I tried same engridients. Why my dough is too sticky? I cannot  knead it.
Thanks for sharing
I have made this bread and it is absolutely delicious. It’s light  and perfectly browned. Thank you so much for giving me my go to recipe. So easy.
Wheat flour + All purpose flour = Bread flour???
Thanks a lot I just made your bread recipe successfully today, it’s so soft inside and crispy outside and light, it’s my first loaf ever and it turns so well with my first attempt, I’ve been going around this recipe for a long time but I hesitate to make it or I might be lazy but it was easier than it looks, I still can’t understand why people buy bread from supermarket when you can make it at home with simple ingredients and easy method to follow, thanks a lot Jenny, please stay safe, regards , Mohammed from Saudi Arabia
I use Almond milk and aquafaba(can garbonza bean liquid for the egg) to make it vegan and it is still the best bread! Yum!
My first time baking bread ever! I have just used this recipe and my bread is so delicious.. super soft and fluffy. My children love it 💓 Receive my love from Kenya 🥰♥️❤️
My first time baking bread and it turned out looking pretty good on the outside but the inside dint bake in layers. It had risen perfect before going into the oven and the crust and bottom have baked extremely well and in layers inside too. I wonder what I did wrong 😟
Haha.. the egg makes me laugh
Can I substitute the sugar with honey?
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST COOKING VIDEOfldsahblsjdhbflajsdhbfljsadhfbalsdjhfbsdakjhdfbasd this is AMAZING
i love Jenny she needs to have another talk show reboot!and then also include a 15 minute dedication to cooking,Polish women rock!
Tried it and it was lovely! My first time making bread and it was a sucess! 👏👏
Hahaha...whose getting married?! :D
This is the best bread!  I have made this a few times and it is really so tasty.  My husband loves it as well. Thank you.  Love your videos.  You are a sweetie!
Jenny why does my bread fall once it goes into  the oven .
Tried to make it. It failed.
"Gotta spank that dough. Who's your daddy?" 🤣🤣🤣
I made this today and it came out great! Who's your daddy
Hey Jenny, of the many breads which i tried, your was the easiest and simple especially for the wheat bread. it has come out really good. Infact i did some value addition by mixing jack fruit puree. Final outcome has really good. Thanks and god bless.
😊..Thank You for posting!🙏
Tried your recipe today ..Turned out amezing. Thank u
I am loving this recipe! Thank you 💖
I run out of milk, is it work if I use water instead of milk?
Great recipe! I live at an altitude of 3400’ in Calgary Alberta. It took almost three hours for the dough to rise. Any suggestions from the forum on what changes to make for a higher and drier climate? The taste was excellent to say the least!  Thank you for any advice.
I’m no baker and this bread was really easy to follow! It turned out not too sweet which my family likes 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 We’re not buying bread anymore! 😊
Jenny you are so adorable love your channel...you are full of pleasant surprises 😄loved the egg bit. Now I’m off to bake some bread 🍞 wish me luck!!
I like u so much ❤❤ your funny and u bake from your heart

Jenny I got it working. Thanks for the tips.  lol

This is a fantastic recipe! I now bake my own bread and it is better than any bread we have had. Delicious and easy! Thank you Jenny.
I love you Jenny , you make me laugh. I tried most of your breads and now I don't buy store bread anymore. Thank you.
Please share eggless recipe for bread
can this be made without egg and get the same type of rise?
If using convection tell temperature and time please
I love this lady everytime I want to see one of her cooking or baking videos She always cracks me up at  the same time calms my stress & depression  a little. She's really fun to watch 😹😹😹😹😹
It can be without egg?
I love it ! Still laughing! Recipe is also yummy !
Thank you Jenny, I now use this recipe all the time. I even make it for my friends. I’m using whole grain wheat flour, so  stinkin good!
Honestly, I can't even tell you how much I am loving these videos. I made the bread rolls this week and my husband and son love them. Thank you!💗
Is there a way we can skip the egg? Any other substitute?
I am in ypur fanklub!
Omg. I tried your recipe and the bread is delicious. Wow.
I asked the question because I do want to improve on this particular bread recipe. The end result is pretty good. I just want to cut down on the time and texture of the bread.
I have tried this recipe at least 6 times following the exact measurements. Each time I have one sticky mess where I have to keep on adding more and more flour. Anyone else experienced this?
can you subsitute the milk for almond milk
I enjoyed your jokes. I’m buying wheat flour tomorrow so I can try your recipe.
Hi mam it looks yummlicious ...i hv one question that in your measurements how much is 1 cup?

Absolutely the best baker 👩🏼‍🍳 ever in everything just perfect 👌 thanks 🙏🏽 lovely lady 🏆

Can i avoid egg ??
Omg!  Tried it today and it came out amazing!  Love your videos and humor 😊
Beautiful !
I can't believe how stupidly simple this was. Much better than store bread. Thanks, Jenny!
Egg in the bra 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
Jenny is so sensual and sexual!
“If you dont have a spatula, what are you doing with your life?” -Jenny
I never laughed so hard in my life. Almost forgot I was watching bread . Hey ..  Great bread ..by the way !!
How to activate the refrigerated yeast and could I avoid using egg?
First bread attempt without a bread machine. Made this bread and it came out beautiful! Thank you Jenny ❤️
Jenny Jones! ❤️
Can I use plant base milk?
I wanna be Mr.Egg
what a funny woman "thats entertainment"
I've made this a few times now and its delicious. Thank you
Thank you for this easy recipe .Always gives fantastic results with even burger buns n hotdog rolls
Thank you ❤️ love to watch u.. v.funny😁
Jenny can really cook, so talented young lady. I m going to make this tonight, never buy bread again, and will spend money on spatulas.
Jenny, you’re crazy😂😂😂 but beautiful with it. Many thanks for recipe. 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧
LOL😂
I tried this ,it came out well. But my bread have a mild smell of yeast. Don't know why? Provide few tips on this plz?
Jenny that was a great video thanks, tho I would have loved to see the texture your loaf achieves, can you break a loaf and show me?
I like your different color utensils.
Very nice video, well done on making bread, I'm going to try this with my recently bought  JENN-AIR mixer.
Amazing recipe.. bread turned out to  be  soft and yummy... even without mixer...
This looks wonderful. I will try it today :)
Gosh! You are so hilarious 🤣 I really enjoyed watching your content. You always make it look so fun and easy to do 🙏🏼
This has become a regular recipe for me. No buying bread. Thanks dear. Very interesting and practical way of presenting.
I’ve made my bread with your recipe and it’s delicious my family loves it! But I ran out of whole wheat flour and rapid rise yeast...if I use only bread and all purpose flour and use active dry yeast instead of rapid...is it the same exact process? and waiting time?
I can not get it to work. multiple loafs and it does not rise. I have had success when I activate the yeast. Never dry. I make sure the milk is 110 degrees, yeast is not expired.  Just won't work for me. I should say never raises like yours does. Oh it always burns at 400 degrees so I am working on that. I don't give up easy. I even started spanking the dough. Didn't help.
You have a good sense of humor 😂
Who’s your daddy😂🤣😂😂😅Had me rollin
Dearest Jenny, I love your recipes but this bread is really wow... the only flaw is that you can't stops eating it:) Thank you !!!
Any substitute for eggs?
If using starter, how much starter?
Love this recipe. It's amazing. If I want to replace sugar by honey. Is it same quantity of sugar?
How much is two cups of flour (weight)
You are the funniest baker I have seen!
I heard you say that dough hook won't work for you, I just purchased a kitchen aid artisan and tried my whole wheat two loaf recipe with six cups of flour and it was unable to mix it properly, does it make a difference if you put liquid first not, thanks ⛄
Bwhahahahhaha whos your daddy
I just watched this video with my seven year old son and we were both laughing and laughing!
Made a double recipe  of this bread. I regular loaf and  the rest I used for rolls.  Perfect and God Bless for the fun you bring to the show.
New to baking I changed my recipe to this one. I mixed whole wheat and white and added flour was the same but I had to add more. Turned out perfect.
Can I use this same dough and make rolls or buns instead? How long will I put them in the oven for?
Hi Jenny. Great recipe. Thank you. Also where did you get your timer and red gloves? I want to be just like you!
Who's your daddy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
she lost me at “knead it 105 times” lol. This made me realise how lazy i am.
This was such a great recipe..followed it to the T...and got the SAME bread...thank you!!!
Hi, I tried the recipe to the T, but my dough hasn't risen even an inch after an hour...I'm so upset and disappointed.😩
LOVE THE BREAD !!! AND THE HUMOUR !!!!! 🤣🤣
And how can I convert it from °f to °c?
What the different between °f and °c in baking...?
You are a darling and a magician. I followed your instructions to a T and for the first time, I made a loaf of bread that looks like a loaf of bread.
i enjoyed watching your video.
I made the bread. Tastes good but texture is dense.
Thanks
Jenny, adopt me....LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU, YOUR RECIPES ARE THE BEST, AND THE EASIEST IVE FOUND SO FAR.
ITD THE WHOS UR DADDY VIDEO YAAY
Jenny, thanks for all your recipes, my family and friends NOW  thought I knew how to good!,,, THEY ARE NOW HAPPY TO COME OVER FOR DINER!!!  Great show, thank you Aussie John at Sunshine Coast.
I stumbled across your channel by accident now I am hook,  (who's your daddy really?) and then the egg, you now have a new subscriber, hope to see you again very soon.
Thank you 🙏 for teaching me how to bake slice bread at home. I love how you organize your kitchen and it’s full of colorful spatulas.
Can you please tell me replacement of egg  ? Tia.
Oh thank god! a presenter with a sense of humor!! Like Springsteen said-"hit them in the funny bone that's where they expect it least"!
You are cute and funny 😀
how long it last?
So obviously I’m a bone head. Just got my new Kitchenaid and heard your comment about dough hooks. With that I humbly apologize for questioning your logic...I am not worthy! You’ve never steered me wrong and your recipes NEVER let me down. PS...love the spatulas. ☺️
I just made this loaf and it is easy and fast to make. I got myself a lovely loaf but I will say that 2 tablespoons sugar is at least 1 spoon too many and the loaf tastes a little bit like cake rather than bread.
I missed watching the bread slicing & how much tm 2 wait till u slice the loaf
Omg u’re so cute with the egg joke😆❤️. Btw I love the recipe, cos its sound very easy to make, absolutely will try it next week. Good job 👍🏼
Eat rice more easy
Just did my bread. Lovely 😊
she didnt cut the bread and show it to us... i got doubts on it's quality 🤔
Just made this recipe and it looks and smells amazing! Thanks for the recipe and more importantly thanks for the humor. #NoSuprises
I read the comments below no one gave the feedback that how there bread turned after following your recipe. All are praising your sense of humour 😁 anyway love trom India'
Jenny  can Cook, I’m from Guatemala.  Looking for bread recipes, I found your videos, and I found them so easy to follow due to your experience! Thank you!

Hi jenny writing from Mumbai India .Have tried ur bread a dozen times n have succeeded 6 times.its an awesome recepie for whole wheat bread.But i get confused with the milk measurments.Can u tell me in mls please.Thankyou.
This is so delicious and easy!! I made this bread and  it turned out so good, my kids loved it!
May I know if I can just use just the bread flour.
My go to bread recipe! Made this tons of times! Love it!!!
Jenny!!! My first time making bread and it came out perfect!! I followed to the "T" my egg was cold and I placed it under my boob😜 and even the spanking and saying the phrase "whose your daddy" 😂 my took a little more than 30 to rise, more like 45 for me.  I'm impressed! I can make bread!! Thank you. You have a new follower.
That was one of the best video!!!!
Yesterday i tried this bread receipe and it comes out perfect.. my husband loved it..  Thanks for the Perfect Recipe.. for more softness cover the bread and let it rest for 1 hr..
Spank the dough ~ “who’s you’re daddy?” 😂🤣😂
What's that green surface you are working on?
The Best! So-ooo Soft!  I get about 14 slices out of this loaf, about 24oz. You had be hooked on Paczki, now you got me hooked on whole wheat bread. The question has been answered, You My Daddy!
Thank you jenny I ❤️this recipe😋
How about just using a dough hook for 5-6 mins?
I made this and it turned out well. Thanks for sharing
Is whole wheat flour and hard wheat flour just the same? Cuz i will Try to bake your recipe.  Im buying the flour online. And i save hard and just wheat flour. Im confuse which is which. Ty
I leave out egg and use soy milk
That was one of the best bread I ever baked! Thank you, Jenny :-)
Lmfaoo... Ayoooo!!! "who's your daddy" bruh she wildin😂😂😂
Always enjoyed watching your teaching and you were super good and funny too!👍🙏
Why add sugar?
That Egg Nestling 😂😂😂😂😂😂oh you are too much...Love You.....your Recipes too....Can't forget your  other video.....gluten-free porn statement.....I nearly choked lol.🤩
I like your smile Jenny Can Cook! And you make the bread look so easy to make! I don't like making food again, but I have to make bread now because I refused to buy it from the stores lately during this 'pandemic'.
Who's your daddy 😂
I'm definitely putting this one in my recipe binder under 'Jenny's Who's Your Daddy? Dough' or is it 'Hoosier- Daddy' Dough? Timeless. I just so happen to have all these ingredients and PLENTY of time on my hands. Grilled chicken on whole wheat anyone? Thank You Jenny. Hope You're Well! XoXoX.
Recently I have tried a few different bread recipes which all turned out ok, but this one is by far the best and the one I shall be using from now on, it is the quickest with the best results, this bread is fantastic and so tasty, thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe - I have made 2 loaves in the past  3 days !!!
Can I do the same recipe but with all purpose flour?  Finding whole wheat flour during this pandemic is difficult.
OMG! "Who's yer daddy?" There's lots to like here.
🤣🤣 bread looks good
My first attempt at whole-wheat bread and turns out perfect! Thanks so much for a brilliant recipe and such handy tips!
"Who's your Daddy?" So Jenny Jones. Love you lady! LOLOLOLOL!
recipe and exact meas.pls
Will this rise this much if I don’t  use egg?
I had to let mine rise for  90 minutes, but it did turn out great.
Yes, very well done video and a good camera presence ! That's coming from a professional 35 year pastry chef !
Bruh, Jenny is my honorary mom now 😂 the spanking, the cleavage joke, I’m DYING over here!!
Lockdown.....and with great hesitation I made this bread....kneaded it with hand. Has come out as a lovely bread. Thanks....I was a little worried....😊
Hi Jenny! Could almond milk be used, instead of cow's milk?
Awesome bread loaf. It turned out perfect. Thanks a lot Jenny😊
I am 53 years old and last night, I made my first loaf of bread. I’ve always been afraid of baking with yeast. Thanks to your video, it was so easy and best of all, it came out perfect and delicious.  I won’t be afraid to make bread anymore thanks to you. I’ve really enjoyed your videos and your humor. Thank you for sharing your wisdom.
I baked two pans today and this recipe is amazing! That's the least to say 😍😍 thank you !!
The bread looks good. Do I just double the ingredients is if I want to make to two loafs?  Thanks
Spanking the dough gets a like from me!
Jenny hope you are okay, I've watched several of your videos over the last several weeks and you make baking such fun, you are truely talented and have a great sense of humour.  I have finally successfully after watching his video baked a lovely loaf of bread, thank you for sharing your time with us, come back soon you have a lot of followers and support from your loyal subscribers.  I'm going to get busy using some of your other videos whilst waiting to see if you start posting again - I have subscribed and hit the notification bell so will be looking out for you.

👍
I just love what you do...  And through all you've been, I admire you so much...  Anyways I got the bread right after watching your video
Bread videos make me so happy 😁 Thanks Jenny!
Thank You.
Unfortunately I have a damaged carpal tunnel on both hands and just cant knead it enuf. If I have men standing around I wash them up and instruct. Thus I use the paddle on my machine.
You are so cute and funny
Your recipe is wonderful.  I made the most beautiful wheat bread after watching.  Thanks!
I’ve been making this bread but in the white bread (no egg) version and it’s delicious! Highly recommend
I absolutely Love this recipe;  I’m a first time baker & tried this out very apprehensively but was amazed at the results.  Your instructions are so precise & accurate.  I also tried the loaf bread & it was delish. I’m forever grateful.  Thank you 💝
Hi, what can be substituted for an egg?
She is funny and nice recipes def subscribing
Who's your daddy , that was funny
Can I use honey instead of sugar? If so, how much?
You are so adorable! Please keep em cumin".
I just subscribed. Only for that egg crackle sound. The fact that it came with a delicious bread recipe is a bonus 😁😁😁
This is the easiest ever bread recipe and no only the easiest but the fastest and the cleanest. I follow the recipe, added the ingredients,raised and baked and my countertop was clean, didn’t have to scrub the flour and even the baking pan is so clean you can’t even tell I used it. In my house we make homemade bread all the time, didn’t bought bred for a few years now and this is the perfect recipe( I tried so many...). Thank you so much for sharing!:). I need to learn to post pics
7:18 “It’s easier if you have cleavage” 😂🤣
Omg! Jenny Jones! Such nostalgia!! I’m gonna make this bread now. 😍😍
What if we only use whole grain wheat flour instead of 1/3 white flour?
We she said spank it, I thought that is tat bit odd then BOOM "who's your daddy?". 😂😂
Good recipe, but please cut the bread next time!!!
Oh, Jenny, I made your 90 minute bread for myself on Mother’s Day.  It’s not only beautiful, it’s delicious!!!!!! Thank you! Sandy
Hi, I would like to know how much gram is one cup, that you use for flour? Thanks.
Made this today and it tastes amazing!! I can't believe how soft and fluffy the bread is!! The only downside to this recipe (for me) is that 35 min was not enough rising time. I needed 2.5 hours to rise it BUT its because I live in a higher altitude (Calgary AB Canada) and we are super dry here. So not sure if that plays a factor in rise time but either way, your recipe was super easy to make and turned out amazing. Definitely will be using this recipe from now on and throwing the other ones out. What I love most about this is that the recipe is good for 1 loaf. As I live on my own, this is perfect. Thank you!
It's really delicious, easy recipe   it's done so well on the first time  Even i used 1/2 cup of all purpose flour instead bread flour because the COVID19 Thanks so much,
I finally found this video! I accidentally bought whole wheat flour tried a normal bread recipe did not work now I’ll try this one.
I am trying out your recipe Jenny because the one I have used 3 times I didn't like much. I bet this is much nicer. Thank you. We made our own flour out of white wheat berries. Excited, it is resting 10 min. then on to the 50 kneads....
Just made it, and came out perfect! Thanks Jenn for your wonderful foolproof recipes!
I’m fat. You?  Click for yes! 🔻
Love the bread! Also love the video!  Your humour is divine!  Thanks
Whole wheat bread I love I will try thank you so much for your video ❤️❤️
Thanks for your video. I made this bread yesterday. It came out nice. My first time of baking bread. Unbelievable easy to follow
She's funny with the egg , Sense of humor ,I remembered her from Hawaii , Thanks for sharing n i will definitely make this bread , probably today ,
Well i just tried this recipe! Its the easiest to follow!
Jenny you are excellent, keep up with your gorgeous art.
Hello Jenny, that was super fast and east recipe.  We'll try for sure.     Thank you sharing your knowledge.   Regards,     James
Thanku for this beautiful recipe.. the bread is so soft...
P.s. I am never going back to packaged yeast.
I use a starter made from half whole wheat and oat flours. What is the amount of starter and rest time for the recipe?
Jenny loved it.  You are so funny.
You are like my favorite aunt. Lolz & luv
3:57
Oh my god..i like you🤣
This video was NOT what I was expecting! 😂😂
Which attachment should we use on the hand mixer? Regular whisk or the dough attachment?
Jenny, great
Is this the Jenny that used to do that show, if it is you still look the same. Will definitely try this recipe.
I thoroughly enjoyed watching and listening to Jenny. She’s so funny, ‘can’t make me use a spatula’. I don’t buy bread anymore, enjoy baking mu own. Really inspired by this lady.
Looks amazing! Is it ok to use saf-instant yeast?
UGH no thermometer! How do I tell if milk 120?????😟😟 HELP
Where have you been??? I came here for the bread recipe and left laughing. I got the recipe as well. Excellent work and good video. Thanks.  How could I NOT subscribe?
Hi Jenny, I love, love this recipe, it is so easy.   never made bread, but I will definetely make this recipe!!!
Hi Jenny, thank you so much for the fantastic recipe and the method of making easy whole wheat bread. We tried it, came out perfectly. God Bless you.
Hello, I found your vídeo funny, there's always time to show the others that we are happy
thanks for the recipe I tried it and I never buy any more bread, grazie from Italia
Jenny, all my love to you from London, UK
Taki domowy chlebek zawsze mi się kojarzy z wakacjami u babci, do tego jeszcze swojej roboty śmietana, teraz sama staram się robić chleb, a śmietana najlepiej mi wychodzi na zakwaskach z firmy narin
Jenny I tried this recipe today but with one major change. I did not have any milk on hand, so I mixed up powdered buttermilk mix with warm water and added to the ingredients. Figured I'd sink or swim with this one, but lo and behold, it turned out great!
You r so rich in your colorful spatula, knives and your timers. U got great tools and you deserve them.💕
This lady is funny and fun to watch! Thanks for the videos.
Excellent. Easy recipe and it does work. I won’t buy any more bread. Plus healthy! From Toronto, Ontario,Canada
I am trying this right now. It is at the 10 minute rest
Great video, Jenny! Just one question: at 0:40 the yeast pack indicates a net weight of 21 grams, but in the video and recipe you mention 2 teaspoons (1 packet / 7 grams). Is it 21 grams or 7 grams? I understand Jenny is overwhelmed with questions, so if someone knows the right amount and can reply sharing it, I would really appreciate it :)
Spanks the dough and says "who's your daddy" ...anddddd. subscribe
How long do you preheat the oven?
Can i substitute the milk with almond / soy milk? Thanks
Hi Jeeny you are as funny as ever.
No flour and no yeast available in the UK here in lockdown. 😔
Thank you for sharing this Jenny. I tried it today it came out very well. This is my first time baking bread. It is awesome 👍😁
Hi Jenny how are you doing...I follow ur recipes and love ur personality....it jus a pleasure and loads of cheerfulness to watch u😍😘😘
The bread looks very nice, but the bread slice is missing!
Ha!! You’re funny. Just subscribed. Lol
Baked this today with exact measurements but my dough was not as sticky but hard. And I proofed it for an hour still it didn’t rise above the pan. What did I go wrong?
soon as the white flour went in, it stopped being whole wheat..
I enjoy your humor ❣️
Lol! She's too funny! Thnx for the easy recipe. Can't wait to try it 😁
Jenny...you are a treat and make good things to eat!! Thanks so much for your channel...I am really enjoying it during "lockdown".
Who is your daddy???
Was wondering why put salt in bread recipe. I always leave out the salt and never see a difference
lmao she's a freak freak! I love it
She reminds me of Jenny Jones
So much  delicius🌷
You have me in stitches, thanks!
I am going to try this recipe.  Can I use just all purpose flour instead of wheat flour?
I made this bread today and it was outstanding! I also will never buy bread again.  Thank you so much for posting this video.  Can't wait to try more of your recipes.  Step by step with exact measurements and temperatures.
Can we skip egg
Lol
Hilarious. I’m going to make this now.
🏉🥅🎿
Followed your recipe as close as I could, ingredients, amounts, technique and timing, has taken 10 hours and dough has not risen above side of loaf tin, decided to put it in the oven and it has collapsed. I have yet to find a fool proof loaf. Regards, A Fool.
I made the bread and it was amazing, my husband said that maybe he wont be able to eat the regular bread that we buy in the store :). I didn't have bread flour so I used the all-purpose flour.
I need it all the time baby
Incredible! Yumo!
I really love all her recipes. They are easy to follow and her ingredients are universal
What if I don’t add an egg?
Your a crack up
love your spatulas
you are very colourful like you spatulas🤣like  all of your videos.
I made my first loaf of quarantine bread. This was the base,  but subbed flaxegg, 3Tb l date sugar, and halved the salt. Used all ww because that's what I had. Didn't rise too high, but still delicious. Thanks, Jenny. Big fan of the show and all the pretty colors.
What size of bread pan should I use for your receipe
The foil in heat not healthy
Love her humor !!!
I don't have regular flour just whole wheat. Any advice on adjusting the recipe?
Jenny, I love your recipes and videos AND you are so funny! 😋
A freak exposed lol.
love this! but i went totally crazy for that tiny mixer timer thingy, where can i get one???????????
AMAZING!!! Love your darn recipes. I'm a pretty passionate baker/cook as is and you just make me want to leap out of my chair and start right now. Thank you for sharing and totally love the cracked egg at the end, LMAO
Please Jenny help!! I've made this bread several times and it's always too wet to knead. I end up with dough gloves. What an I doing wrong?
Tried this, today. I think I will never buy bread, again.
Loll that ending
My white bread dough didn't rise very much during the 45 min.Did I overwork my dough in mixer?
My dough turned out super dry 🤔
😀😘❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹
👋I love you Jenny😍.  Especially all of your recipes are easy to cook. 😂🤪This episode is so funny 😂 🤪
YOU....  YOU....  👆👉 👆👉 👆👉 THE EGG WAS EMPTY 😲😱😈👻 wasn't it ?!?  Brilliant  !!! The best bread videos for sure !!! We make a lot by them... Many many thanks 🙏🙏🙏🤗🤗🤗  But  WHY   egg in room temp.   What is the difference  ?!?
Jenny that's a great recipe! & you are hilarious with the egg & cleavage 😂🤣😂
can you substitute the milk
1 cup milk is equal to how many ml? Thank you
1cup is equal how many gram?
Does white whole wheat work well?
Very nice..
Just made this today and turned out Great! Jenny is The BEST!👏🏽👏🏽
Give me that cloth cover
Hey Jenny..thanks for the great recipe...it worked out really well 👍
I like the recipe but I would like the wheat flour bread and not use all purpose flour in it due to health reason. Can you tell if it is ok to substitute 1/2 cup of flour with wheat flour only. We  do not have bread flour here in my place where I live. Secondly you added the yeast straight into the floor? While I am kneading the dough can I put the yeast directly or shall I put in lukewarm water for fermant?
Very good job keep it up 🥰🥰🥰
Hello Jenny I made this bread today. Everything went okay until I put it in the loaf pan  It hardly rose at all. I think that the milk was too warm and killed the yeast and kept the dough from rising. I'm going to make this bread again.I will let you know how it turns out. It was funny when you pat the dough and said "who's your daddy" Thank's for the video.
How about showing us how to make cinnamon raisin bread..I love the way you bake..
You SOOOO crack me up! I love your videos. I happen to have all the ingredients in this recipe.Yay! I have made bread before, when my kids were little. My bread always came out looking more like a miniature torpedo! But, I learned from watching your videos how essential the kneading process is. I wasn’t kneading my bread dough nearly enough. So, I’m going to try it again!
I made this bread today. So easy and delicious😋. Thanks for the recipe
I  love this channel, how did I  just found it a few days ago. 😮 you are so funny.
Can I use all the wheat flour rather using all purpose floor?
Love this channel still today. Upbeat and charming and just all around pleasant - plus recipes that work and taste delicious!  Thanks, Jenny!
Thanks for that recipe.  I like fresh baked bread. Its really good.  Well, thanks also for that egg tip.  So funny. Lol
@jenny can cook can I replace egg with flax seeds or yoghurt in this recipe ? Please let me know the measures if you think so ..
Thank u so much...this makes bread making fun
awesome
hee haw...who's your daddy...lol
I just baked this today.  Delicious.  I also baked 2 loaves of your bread in the Dutch oven.  Enjoying your recipes with all the quarantine time on my hands.  I appreciate you sharing.  You’re adorable also!!   Love your personality you share with us. 🥰
HeyJenny! This recipe and your tips have gotten me to be a successful bread maker.  I used my mixer to knead the dough and it worked out just fine.  Thanks!
This is the best loaf of whole wheat bread I’ve ever made. Usually I end up with a whole wheat brick.  And I appreciate the fact that this is a recipe for one loaf. Most recipes are for two loaves. Thank you so much for this.
Jenny, you are TOO funny!😆 And can cook! New #subbie👍🏾
you inspire me   thanks for lesson
Works fine with a hand mixer just use the dough hooks. I used soy milk and a flax egg worked very well too. Baking Jenny's "No Knead" bread maybe for about 5 years now 🥰.
I couldn’t believe where she put that dam egg! LOL 😂 😂 This woman can cook and is too hot! 🥵
You lost the count😀,
Thanks for recipe
How much is 1 cup of wheat flour in grams?
Pp
wish i met you 40 years ago girl
Thanks for sharing this video, it's helpful to get a few different versions to perfect my bread. I have followed a couple of your recipes before and find your videos enteraining! Keep it up and thank you for the humour! Preparing to replicate this recipe for the second time. I really like this bread.
AWSOME!!! Starting week 5 of the stay at home order here in Ohio. I've been making about 3 loafs of bread a week in our bread machine which had been put away for almost 10 years. Been making a wheat, a cinnamon & a Simple Rosemary. They all taste good but I just don't like how they look coming out of the machine, kind of short and the machine groves on the sides. Saw your video and since I bought my wife the heavy duty kitchen aide mixer 2 years ago with every signal add on for the front insert point!!!!  You did an awesome job on the video!!! Very high quality!!!! Tomorrow for dinner I'm going to make your salmon patties and use a slice of this great wheat bread.
Jeez I love you Jenny Jones.
I love your smiling will try making this bread tomorrow
Thank you  so much I did it my wife could not believe it..thank you..you're a good teacher..
Excellent bread...thanks
can you make the bread without using the mold?
Jenny you're really tops. Just enough explanations and a lovely video. I'm going to try your bread. Love from a cook book author and foodie.  Sabita
Jenny! - You are AMAZING!! - I DID IT !!! - And you're hilarious, watched your vids for humour and inspiration but now with the ISOLATION - I actually did it and it worked YAY!!! (Baked on 180 c 'cos 190 scared me lol)
i love when she proudly show her new spatula... thats my kinda style. oh god, i love the timer!!
I'm reading some of the comments and they're so funny. I will try to make the bread with Jenny's recipe tomorrow and will be using the hock handle on my industrial KitchenAid mixer. The only problem is that I can't tilt the stupid head backward to remove the handles and it is kind of hard to work with this machine.  That's when you ask your husband to get you an easy to use mixer you get the largest one so you can work harder lol
She is funny, I like her. The video was short and funny I like it
OMG!! I just realised this is Jenny Jones! I'm not from the US so, although she looked familiar, I didn't know why. Used to love her show. :-)
Why would 2.2k people give this a thumbs-down? I don't get it. Love Jenny Can Cook! She *can* cook, and she's hilarious.
And I love it,,,"who's your daddy"!
Thanks so much, you are so cute and funny.
Jenny! Come back please! We need your cooking wisdom!!
Jenny can you make asian style pastry/milkbread
Jenny if I only have active yeast can I proof it and use it in this recipe?
I am your daddy! you most sexy backer in the world!
Hello ♥ very good i made so many Times very good  Thanks so much ☀❤🙏🙏 good luck 🌹
great bread
thank you
getting married, gosh couldn't stop laughing
You are just too cute and funny. Thanks. OMG I had not heard " Who's your Daddy"  in ages lol hysterical 😆
I followed all the steps but unfortunately it got stuck inside the mould. Thx4sharing
So funny  haha
How many grams should be each Doug?
Jenny can cook!!!!
Who’s your daddy? that is what guys say right...so what is it that women say? ....I am your subscriber now on account of The Who’s your daddy line...
So happy I found you again 😍 sooo gonna make your breads . You are so lovely to watch . Great cook and Love your kitchen !! Keep up the great work , and America loves you !
Clicked on this video and jumped ahead immediately. Somehow landed at 3:56 and now I'm horny.
Humor 👎
Would I be able to make this with regular flour and not whole wheat flour?
I'm old fashioned-- I let my loaf double rise.  Also, I've found when using whole wheat flour, right out of my mill, smaller loaves turn out better unless you throw in some white flour (or gluten), then you can use a normal loaf pan.
🤣🤣🤣🤪🤣🤣😂😂😂😂👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🤟🏼thank you
I don't know why my dough turned out dry, firm and wasn't smooth at all. I don't have a hand or stand mixer. I knead by hand for around 10 minutes.  Can you please give some tips? Your dough looks so soft and smooth.
I have made this bread several times. It always turns out great. However it has to strong of a wheat flavor for my taste. I made a loaf with 1 cup wheat and 1 cup oat flour. It rose properly ,taste great ,fairly moist,and softer than the all wheat. The problem was it was very crumbly and difficult to eat as a sandwich without making a mess. Does anyone have suggestions of what to add or change to make a tougher bread? Thank you for your help.
Wow! Jenny Jones! I used to watch her talk show back in the days; she looks good. Great segment; I'm gonna try it!
Love your sense of humour.
Unexpected climax 😂 I bursted out in laughter...
Your channel is so much fun! You cracked me up when you smashed the egg in your bra. Love your pink nail polish too!
Thanks so much Jenny . My family are so thrilled that I've been able to produce a 'real' loaf  of bread at last.  I'll be making this wholemeal loaf daily throughout isolation.  Our quality of food has certainly improved with your help. Regards Linda from South  Eastern  Australia
SPANK THAT DOUGH who's yer daddy!!!
I must say this is one of the best Bread i did up to now! Thank You Jenny!
If using wild yeast how much yeast to use for this flour measurement?
Some body know what is two cup flour in grams  and one cup in liters  plz
KitchenAid mixer brand to bread makers seems like Canon brand to professional photographers.
Jenny.. you and your humor.. such a delight in such depressed times of lockdown..I hope you are keeping well..
What are substitutes for milk ? Is it mandatory?
Simple & fast . Thank you Jenny .
Milk and egg? That's something, but it's not bread.
Baking comedy! Love it!
OMG! I'm so subscribing! :-) Thank you for the tutorial and the humor.
😁 i like your video
This host's mannerism is really endearing
Mine turned out just like yours, so easy and delicious.
Love it! A touch of humor 😉
Thanks Jenny, this is a great and simple way to make delicious bread. I love it!!!  I always am stocked up on flour, but went to several stores yesterday including Costco and no flour was to be found. Bummer!  The good news is, I have enough for several loaves, but will be hurting after that. Thanks again and take care.
Baking my wheat bread now can't wait to taste them first time baking bread it exciting lots of love from the Bahamas
I enjoy watching just because you are a funny lady and of course the recipes
No milk, water work for this receipe?
OMG!  You are too funny.  Love the 'who's your daddy' comment.  I made this bread and it is wonderful!!  Thank you!  I subscribed.
My desire to bake my own bread led me here. This seems easy. Gonna try it soon and let you know how it went. Never baked b4.  🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Can you use warm water instead of milk?
Hi Jenny, thanks to you we baked our first fresh homemade bread. I wish I could send you a picture. We enjoyed it with some creamy butter. Take Care.
Hi Jenny...I followed your recipe for making Bread...and thanks for your tips about covering the Bread after 15 mins... now my Bread looks real Good...Nice...not the Top being Overburnt... thanks.. really appreciate and enjoying your video 👍🙏👏
Jenny, I Love your channel!!!!! I see you have not posted ANY new posts since 4 years ago. Are you alright??? Any reason you are not still posting??? I LOVE your channel!!!!!!!!
Omg I love your recipes! You make them look so easy and fun. And you’re so cute and funny. Thank you so much.
Hi Jenny:). You're too funny.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
Haha everything is easier with cleavage 🤣  that's my favorite pocket🤣
Lol......you are funny!  Love your videos!
Can I make it without egg
Watching from Kenya. Thanks for sharing your bread baking. I baked today and turned out great.
Just another congratulation. Magnifique and practique recipe, and helpful on quarantine.   You didnt expect this success,  but is very confortant to watch this down. Be fine.
how many ml of milk  - i'm confused - 1 cup whole is not as 1 (same) cup of milk  ?
It's easier if you have cleavage 😅
I loved the last bit!
Whose is your daddy? I fell off the kitchen chair laughing.
You are so awesome that was the best recipe ever that I made beautiful loaf of bread of course lots of kneading I don’t have a mixer thank you for showing us 🌹🌷❤️👍🌺🌼🌸🌺🌻
"You're getting married?!" (CRUNCH)! "Crap!"" Classic line! Oh yeah, this bread is AWESOME! Thanks for sharing.
I cant "who's your daddy?"🤦🏾‍♀️🤣🤣😂
Awesome presentation and best time-management 😎
I made this yesterday and made all kinds of mistakes and it still came out BEAUTIFULLY.  It's a fantastic soft sandwich bread.
Thank you for your quarantine recipe 💯👌 Love from India ❤️
I love subtle humor.
Can I opt out the egg? I'm vegan.
can i use only all purpose flour ? i dont have whole wheat.
Looking good there Jenny with a bit of fun too which is also helpful. My mom used to bake great apple tarts & rhubarb tarts but a special treat at Christmas was, she would make jelly(which I think you call jello), using milk which was difficult to make because it was very easily spoilt by the mixture curdling. But I must try your brown loaf.
Do you have a good recipe for plain white bread? Thanks in advance.
can you double the recipe to make 2 loaves or is it better to make one at a time? i’m new to bread making.
Just took mine out of the oven, smells wonderful and looks beautiful! I wondering if this could be doubled, for two loaves. I don’t see why not, because one loaf will be disappearing today! Jenny, you are so fun and refreshing!
I wish you were still posting videos!
If I don’t want to use egg? Any other addition?
I just love the way you keep everything simple & honestly whatever recipe I tried from your Chanel turns out GREAT! Thank you :)
it's very entertaining to watch you Jan😊❤️ you're so sweet and funny
We just made this exact recipe.  We ground up our own Red Whole Wheat and used it in the recipe, we were worried that it wouldn't rise, but it actually rose very well, and baked into a wonderful soft loaf with a mild slightly sweet flavor.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
Anyone know what thermometer you use to measure the temperature of liquids when cooking?
The best recipe ever 😍
Great video, have always enjoyed her!
The egg
Stopped in for the bread recipe. Subscribed for the witty banter.
My new hobby beside oil painting.👍🏻you're great thanks for sharing
I tried this and it is so quick and easy plus delicious. Thanks
Simply brilliant thankyou
Not an easy simple recipe by any means!!!!
Since at this time I'm very low on milk, can I substitute and use water instead?
who's your daddy🤣
LOVE this bread and the no knead artisan bread. thank you, you have been an absolute life saver to me in this pandemic!!!
Where  Is the recipe?
Ridiculous egg and milk on bread.  I looked at wholewheat bread not croissant recipe
I love this bread I have made 3 loaves.
It took me 2 of your bread making episodes to remember who you are or were. I used to watch your talk show. You’re so funny.
Wish I were an egg!
Can I add chocolate chunks
bahaaaa that ending
I have been buying this great bread for $6.99 at my local market, not no more! Ever notice It's always a sweet girl like this who turns out to be freaky  -- Who's your daddy LOL
This is the best bread I have ever made! Thanks Jenny
Jenny where been baby I grew up watching you glad to see you're in good spirits
Thank you so much Jenny and I love you ♥️ stay home stay safe.

What is the cost of that mixer
Thank u....it was helpful 😊
Thank you Jenny, With your instructions today I could make a loaf bread
Who's your daddy??
Hi thanks for ur lovely receipe. My dough has a lots of cracks after I knead it. Secondly the dough doesn't rise well the second time. What could b the reason? I use instant dry yeast.
Will try your recipe. Thanks
Can you make it the same way only with all white flour?
Can I use almond milk??
Jenny bringing the Boys to the yard just like she did in the 90s.  Kids this is how I met your mother
This is the best bread I have tried so far! Thank you so much for sharing 💜
Hi Jenny..why have you stopped doing videos? I love all your videos ..you make everything look so simple to do...hope all is well  and please do consider doing more..some chicken dishes..stay safe!😉
I love it .... very easy and funny
Tried this recipe. Turned out great!
Can we use water instead of milk .?.cos we are lockdown here and out of milk😢
I have Diabetes & Cancer patients in the house. How can I avoid Sugar in the recipe?
Where did you leave it..the warm spot I mean
New to the channel, but having a blast watching and baking. Thanks Jenny!
can you use almond milk
cute lady :p
3:58 DIED!!!!!! 😂😂😂
I would make this, but I couldn't even find flour in my supermarket
Hi, what is the heat setting for a convection microwave to make this bread?
Dang you’re funny! Spatulas. Who’s your daddy? Lmao. Saving this. I’m gonna make this today!
I love your videos. :)
jenny...you are such an adorable cook. I have tried most of your recipes and they all worked. Hats off!!....a big hug from Beirut; lebanon
Is that self raising flour or plain flour,does that make a difference please,sorry I’m a new year.
I enjoyed u r video and will try this soon.
Excellent!
Don't have to grease the pan. Depends on the pan your using.
how to store the bread? and for how long does it last?
Thank you so much Jenny, this video helped a lot❤️
Who is here after lockdown and you cant go out to buy bread?
Who is here after lockdown and you cant go out to buy bread?
Who is here after lockdown and you cant go out to buy bread?
My took over 1 hour to rise ?? At 35 mins mark it had done nothing
Jenny, you made me laugh with that final comment ‘what, you getting married?’. Thank you!!
SHE couldn’t fathom why I asked her to order a 50 lb. bag of flour in the next Catering Shop delivery. Pie dough, English muffins, pancakes, waffles, baguettes, biscuits, pasta, boule’s, loaves, fried fish and chicken, cookies and Coronavirus.  At 88 I don’t wear a bra anymore. But, I have a pocket in my jockstrap.
I just subscribed.. your really funny :)
I love this lady's style.  She is really good.
The minute she took the bread out, I hit the SUBSCRIBE button. This is too good. It's sad I forgot to buy a loaf tin.
I immediately subscribed after she said “who’s your daddy?”😂😂🤪💀
Why is my bread sticking to the pan when I dump it out after it’s baked?
Where did you find that nice big board you use for your bread and rolls. Could you please respond to me ? Thank you♥️I love all your recipes and your breads are fantastic 👍👍👍
I just love her!!  I am subscribed when she did that thing with scrunching the foil. OMG
Wow! Just happened to read up on your life and the hardships you went through. A drummer in a band, a TV show host, stand up comedienne and now a chef...kudos to you
You are so hilarious & real.
If you don’t have whole wheat flour can white all purpose be substituted with good results?
Jenny it’s Mar 28 2020 middle of corona virus pandemic and I want to thank you for this video and recipe. It’s easy, quick and better bread than we were purchasing before. I have several 5 lbs bags of both flours so we are able to sustain our bread needs. Thanks you’ve been a huge help
I liked the ending part 😂
Is dry yeast the same as active yeast? this is my first bread, I know nothing about baking. Please teach me!
I must try this wholemeal flour bread. thanks for the recipe.
You make it look so easy you are a good teacher
Honestly this has been a life saver since this coronavirus nonsense. If you need to make this but dont have eggs I did this with using all all purpose flour and added an extra 1 and a half table spoons of oil and it still came out delicious! Everyone loved it
Turned out fabulous! BTW...the ending is Hilarious! 💕
In the oven now....thank u!
Is it possible to use Almond Milk instead of regular milk?
All i can find are in 2012-2018
By the way, is Jenny making any videos in 2020?
Great! I never have to buy bread again! I prefer jenny's recipe anyways
Omg! I just realized you’re Jenny Jones!!!! From THE 90s! 😅
Oh my I love you! You have AMAZING recipes and you make me Laugh!
can we steam loaf ?
Jenny is my favourite! 🌈🍂🍃
Cool bananas! Will give it a go. Left my bread machine in South Africa. Decided to give your recipe a go. Can't wait for the sun to rise so my bread can rise. Thanks for putting the recipe on line. Took out the egg from the fridge so long. Thanks for making it fun.
Yummyyy...gonna try  it so soon 🙂
What can I replace the egg with?
Jenny, how come you are not making more food videos? I love to watch you cook. Thank you. I didn't know you could use that beater instead of the bread hook.
Thank God for your varied recipes and the video helps soooo much!
Greetings from Russia! Thanks not only for the recipe, but also for the wonderful mood, honey lady )))
LMAO "who's your daddy?" slapping the dough cracked me up..that's going to be a sub from me.
I enjoy your presentation and video.. such humble added into it. The bread looks so good i am going to make it myself too! Thank so much for the recipe and method.
Hahah..you earned my sub😂👌
"Who's your daddY!"  I truly did not see that coming.  Damn that was funny.
Hi can someone let me know how to replace the ingredients into VEGAN recipe? Thank you 😘
one of the best baking vids on YouTube. one question, I tried it 2 times following exactly the steps; but, it feels like the bread is a little crumbly. Does it need more liquid?
Jenny stop using foil , aluminum is so bad for the brain ❣️
👍🌻🌻🌻
can you make this bread with white flour please
I’m glad she’s retired as she deserves to be but I’m sad I didn’t know about this channel until now.  Thank you Jenny!
I've made all these three to four ingredient breads and what they all have in common is they're beautiful when done, but very BLAND tasting.
Me!
😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂
she has a great sense of humor!
Nobody:   YouTube @ 4am: wanna watch her make bread?
She is delightful!
Did we ever find out who the daddy was?
Love the recipe .    Jenny, is that a Lands End shirt??? I have one just like it 😂😂😂
Is this Jenny from the Jenny Jones show?
I LOVE YOU
U r sooooo funny
U r hilarious.. "Who is ur daddy.." And then d surprise at last... Bravo 😅
P.S. The bread, however, is amazing! Yum!
I did not oil pan as instructed but  that was a mistake.  Bread stuck to pan and I scratched my pan getting the bread out. Very sad about that.
My type of gal " who's your daddy"  HILARIOUS
What can be replaced in the place of egg?
You have such a bright and fun kitchen!!! I love your recipes and, most of all, your excitement for what you do.
any replacement for the egg?
I love your channel.. first time i saw your was the lemon brownie, and i have tried that the next day, and believe it or not i ate 3/4 of that in one sitting while watching friends hahahah.. i almost forgot to leave some for mu husband..  Been looking for bread recipe and yours is much easier..   Lots of love here
I'd rather spend my money on spatula too😅
Easy to bake. Love it.
I made this bread it turned out perfectly I didn’t use whole wheat at all I used all purpose.  I will definitely do this again first time I’ve made bread in decades!
Awesome bread. My family members who dislike wheat bread thought this was amazing! And so did I. Very good bread and even a novice bread maker like myself could make it.
Hey, Jenny, my is Pedro Dapazneto . I would like to known how many minuts to cook the bread
Made this bread today with grandchildren, was delicious
Yup, new subscriber here,Lol.
I'm trying this bread recipe as I'm typing this.  It doesn't seem to be rising very much.  Fingers crossed.
What if we dont have wheat flour Can we use all purpose
This just showed up in my suggestions!  Was hoping it was a NEW VIDEO! >>>> I miss your happy cooking videos, JENNY!   Luckily I hadn't seen it before, so it was new-to-me!
I just watched and I am a big fan already. 😀
She’s so great, who dislikes this??????
She put an egg between her titties 😂😂😂😂 that is what I do literally EVERY TIME because I'm bad at planning ahead to let them get to room temp on their own
Besides an excellent recipe... a GREAT Humorous presentation!!!  THANK YOU!!!  =)
Lol “who’s your daddy” liked ya when you had your Jenny Jones show and I love ya in the Jenny can cook show.:) <3
You are so lovely and enjoyable to watch. I look forward to making this recipe.
I love your bread but I dont understand the measurments. I wish you could explain in metric too.
3:57...THIS LADY WON ME OVER! Liked and subscribed!!!!!
Love your recipes!
Thank you!!!!  Everything came out great EXCEPT you said not to spray my pan.... It's supposed to be non-stick BUT it stuck super badly.
No milk or eggs at the store so far. So l can't make it yet :(
You make me laughing 😀☺😄😃 can't wait to try this 🍞 bread!
You could be my “ daddy”  anytime ! 😘. I wanna be the egg !
Why do you have to warm up an egg? I am so confused
I made it and it is so good, my family love it. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
Will it work in bread machine?
Just made your terrific EASY Whole Wheat Bread recipe.  Subbed 4 TBSP. of melted butter for the olive oil.  Sorry bout that.  I godda have budda.  Lol.  This amazing, delicious loaf is destined to be our new household staple.  There is no store-bought whole wheat sandwich bread out there that can compare to this recipe - and, yes, it really is that easy.  I'm a big fan of your YouTube channel Jenny.  May you continue to do this for many years to come.  Stay safe and healthy.
Who's your daddy LMFAO
I am not a good baker! Made this recipe this morning and used honey.....it turned out amazing!!!
Is it me or does Martha Stewart look kinda different these days? 🤣
Love you.
Who's your daddy?????! 👎
WHAT....YOU GETTING MARRIED? Egg broken, scrape me from the floor! 😁😁😁😁
I love Jenny having tried several of her recipes. She has a lovely easy going personality
You are a hoot.  Got me laughing.  Thank you.  I love the bread recipe too.
I made this bread this morning.  I may have heated my milk to hot. My bread didn’t rise the 1in above the bread pan like your did.  I baked it anyway.  The bread only rose up 3 1/2 in. It’s dense but really good. I’ll try to make it again tomorrow.
I wonder if I can sub the whole wheat flower for all purpose or bread flour. Research time.
Buahahahahaha! @ 3:57 -  Who's your daddy?
Shape your foil tent by turning the bread pan over and pressing foil over it, even between two of them.
Quick question...every time I make bread and the dough has to raise...it never does...WHY? What am i doing wrong? Could it be that kitchen is a little bit cooler, since everything is open? Thanks for the tips.
Jenny...you rock! In the past, I could NEVER do bread. Never came out like it should...But with your recipe...it is sooooo delicious!!! The first time I saw one of your videos was with Chocolate cake...guess what...so easy and still making it a lot of time. Will do some more of cake for another week, since you feel like having sweets, not being able to go to the store and with your cake...hmmm....goooood!!! Thanks, Jenny!
Can I use plant based milk?
I just found your channel and my first time watching you made me laugh. your awesome will continue to watch more. I have subscribed.
Youare the best 👍💖
Can someone confirm if Jenny is Jenny Jones? I sweeearrr this is her and I just want to say I LOVED her show growing up as a kid and now I’m in love with how she explains making bread! I’m definitely inspired during this quarantine. ❤️
I don't have that ban,but definitely I will buy tomorrow,my family is very large and we eat 10 to 12 bags of bread every week.😂😂😂 the egg part was funny
Oh my goodness. I just came across this 4 years after it was posted. This was so funny. This seems like an entirely different Jenny Jones from the Jenny Jones Show. She's so relaxed here and funny! Great recipe by the way, I will try it
I love watching you, thanks for the bread recipe I am totally trying it
Nice discovery ... Thanks for sharing your knowledge. I made one and I can tell you it tastes awesome !
This is saving me and my mind in the corona quarantine. Learning how to cook 😅😁
I made this.  It was perfect.
Yummy,,, so simple,gotta try it out myself.Greetings from Melbourne Australia.
Baking bread is going to be my new corona virus quarantine activity!!  I can't wait to bake this tomorrow morning.  Thank you
she´s bold
Jenny: I made one and it came out like I have never seen and ate before. Thanks a lot. A marvelous recipe. However, I like to know if I need to reduce the sugar and salt in it. What could I increase to compensate it.   Pradeep Dhamija
lol@ who's your daddy
Hi Jenny! You havent changed in over 30  yrs ?since you were on that wonderful informative show on tv. You have a wonderful presence+ voice for demonstrating anything. It warms my heart at 64 to see you still at it informing the public. Just cant remember in my brain fog what the name of the show was on in the am+think you had a cohost , Dave Something? Anyway, keep looking good+ shining your beautiful sweet  light for all In the  future. You are awesome,Jenny.❣
Oh Ms Jenny love ur channel u made me Laff to tears with the egg in the cleave and “what you getting married “ bit . Blessing
Oh my!!! I am so glad to have found you! New subscriber that’s enjoys cooking but has not done a lot of baking. Just bought my 1st bag of all wheat flour and ready to make some bread! Love your humor! Thank you for making baking fun! ~ Fred
Who else is making this recipe cause they didn’t find any in stores 🙋🏽‍♀️
"WHO'S YOUR DADDY?" OMGLADIATORSANDALS  I love her!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Who's you're daddy?" *smack*
Jenny you are so funny!!!!!!
We need this now so much! Learn to make your own bread folks! Don’t worry about the bread Absent in stores.
How can I make it fully 100% whole wheat. I can't eat white flour.
Had to watch this because everyone bought the bread at the store because of the stupid carona virus... i picked the right vid to watch shes funny
Hi Jenny, been making your bread for about 6 months, perfect every time! I have been making your Pancakes for way longer than that. Yes, darling, You Can Cook! Thank you
OMG, the egg 😂😂😂👍🏼
thank you so much Jenny! I'll be trying this tomorrow ... hope mine turns out as good as yours. <3
That's a lot of yeast. I would normally use about one eighth what you used, maybe less.
Funny sense of humor that is very relatable I am definitely watching more of your videos
She wasn’t kidding when she said that she rather spend her money on spatulas
U're fun and informative. 😁
I think you are wonderful and love your sense of humor while you cook...
Oh my gosh....Jenny Jones.  I love you.
Hi Jenny.  I made this recipe last night and these were the best salmon patties I’ve ever made.  I’m so glad I found you’re web site.  Your recipes are easy to follow and the ingredients are something that most people have on hand or won’t have trouble finding.  I’m glad I don’t need to visit speciality store for them.  Thank you.   Beboppangel.
Jenny, I made this bread.  It was fast,easy and so good.  It didn’t last long so I’m getting ready to make it again.  Thank you so much for this great recipe.  Beboppangel
So colorful..love it..the spatula
Is it ok to use a k beater instead of a dough hook
THIS IS WHERE THIS MEME COMES FROM I LEGIT JUST WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE BREAD AND FOUND THIS INTERNET HISTORY 😭😭
Thank you for your lecture. Your quantitative makes it very easy to make. More wisdom always.
You are so funny😁😁😁 Love your videos 😁😁💟💙💚💟💙 I will try this in my bread machine Thanks😀😀😀😀
OMG aren’t you the low cholesterol gourmet I watched in the 90’s?????   I haven’t seen you since but l love this video and will try your recipe 🙂
The egg was the fastest way to get a subscriber!! 🤣
In the future please cut into your bread so that everyone can see what the air pockets should look like. Also can see what the texture should be like
I followed Jenny's recipe step by step and my bread came out beautifully. I'm so proud to say I made my first loaf of bread and it was delicious!!! Thanks,Jenny!😀
Can you only use normal flour?
I fucking love you Jenny, I’ll make this bread right meow. I’ll make sure to ask the dough “who’s your daddy?”
Can't have cold eggs can we? You are so funny! Who's your daddy! ???😀😁😂😃😐😂
Made this yesterday and it’s sooooo good! Never buying bread again.
omg to funny !! only problem , no idea what rack in the oven , but i guess the middle
Jenny can cook alright !
Im your daddy baby! xoxo
I am watching this on the eastcoast at 6 am and I am high and she's got me too thru lmaoo!!!
I feel like I just got myself an american mom. thanks for these lovely videos, Jenny!
Thank you very much!🤗
Oh, you're a very entertaining lady! I'm going to bake it tomorrow for my little daughter!! Thanks a lot!!
Hi Jenny... if I wanna make more than one loaf, can I double the recipe? I actually made this recipe vegan. I use soy milk and flax meal of table spoon to replace the egg. It tasted good. Thanks for sharing your talent.
what a waste !
No you was at 13 or so.  so you went over a bit by 3 or so. Omg all you had t do was cut, edit, make a crunch sound but taken it out. You really broke in on you ?
"Who's your daddy" goes to click subscribe 😂😂😂  Next stop..... the comments
Can I do this with our egg I’m out of eggs
Sugar ?
Hahaha nice video and funny 😂
lol funny <3
: spanking the dough, Who's your daddy!👀
Will reducing the sugar affect the bread? Besides it being less sweet, of course.
You DO need to grease your pan! Bread was good, tho. A little too sweet for me.
Can you use swerve instead of sugar or do you need the sugar to help the yeast?
Great Bread, Beautiful Woman...
Good recipe, but weird person
You’re a riot!
A really lovely lady. Makes me hapy to watch and listen to her. Made me hungry too.
4:00 really didn't have to happen
My dough was very sticky a nightmare to work with
Baked me a loaf(I’m a rookie), it stuck to the pan, but the taste was great
Very true “this loaf of bread speaks for itself”👍👍👍👍
I remember Jenny from the 90s
Hey Jenny... Can we replace egg with something else??
I made this bread today and it was of a store bought quality. Thank you for sharing this recipe 🥰
Jen ! m ur fan in just one vid.... never knew baking bread with pinch of humor so simple n sexy
So I found this recipe and let me tell you,this is hands down the simplest recipe ever,I have made 8 breads already in 3 days and this will be my recipe for years to come,thanks Jenny....
Jenny you are so funny!  I love watching your cooking vids, I learn so much!
You are so funny!  😂  I love 💗 your videos, and your directions and recipes turn out great!
ive got that mixer and i dont care for the kneading attachment either...!  what a great recipe again. !
Why did you  use that attachment?
Oh, my gosh! You’re hilarious!
Who’s yo Mama!!!
I love your colorful kitchen tools!
That egg!!  You crack me up Jenny ♡ ty for the recipe
I have watched your video twice and yesterday I made a loaf using your recipe. I have my own bread machine which I used for dough only but I found your tutorial so useful. Thank you so much ❤
Omg shes a freak. Who’s your daddy? Tit egg? I’m 29 but yes pls
Oh, we miss you, Jenny
My problem with Jenny is that when I watch her bake/cook I don't want to stop and I do have other things to do.
Jenny, you make baking look so easy, thank you 🙏 for making recipes I can  bake😀
I love this! Excellent wheat bread and so fluffy!  I also modified it to do two loaves of white which turned out excellent as well. Thank you so much!
Fantastic recipe... However, I don't have a nice stand mixer.. Can you show me how to make this with just my hands??  Thanks!!!
Very nice
can i use whole  meal self  raising  flour to this. ??
Jenny, do you have a recipe book?  I love your recipes, they are so user friendly.
I wish I were that egg..what a place to be.
If you eggs cold, warm it up with your body (proceeds to stuff egg down shirt)
Surely it would be easier just to use a breadmaker.  It does the mixing, kneading and rising for you, it will also bake it if you want it to, or you can just use it make and prove the dough, ready to manually shape and leave for the final rise and then bake it in a conventional oven.
Made the bread and it was delicious!! Thank you!
So, Felt kinda strange spanking the dough yelling who's your daddy! when I am a daddy, but I am eating the first slice of bread from this recipe as I write this.  90 minutes is right on the money. Thank you!
Jenny, you are hilarious! Love to watch you cook & I like your spatulas too. I have wanted a whole wheat bread recipe and you have made it the perfect one. Thanks so much.
I'd never consider putting milk and egg into bread, yuk.
I Love You Jenny..
Jen, any chance you'll come back and continue to cook with us or for us?  I love your recipes and really hope you come back! 💕💖
You have to recomend me your drug dealer,this is the first recipe of bread where i see the egg put directly in the mass.
You are so funny!!!   Love u!
Good place to store eggs loved it dear😊💕💕
I wish you cut it open and let us see.
What a wierdo. But she's confident in it, so I guess it's ok :)
You are... the BEST cooking channel I have found 😂😂😂 totally subscribed!!!
Who’s your daddy 😂
You are a sweetheart
Do you have to mix whole wheat flour with regular flour?
👍👍👍😂😂😂lovely
Jenny, Are You aware you use a lot of sexual references? 😩
This recipe is now my standard go to bread recipe. I changed it up just a little, I substituted honey for sugar. I’ve shared this with several people.
Love your presentation twin  of BARBARA EDEN. you can come and wash my baseball anytime..or any balls..basket, tennis or other. you are so charming
My god u r just awesome.....
Jenny, can you make white bread using this recipe, only substitute white flour instead of wheat. Thank you
I almost spit out my lunch on the "who's your daddy" line. You are a hoot
Hi!  This is my first Post and I'm hoping I can find some help here.  I have been making no-knead breads using bread flower have also used bread flower with 25% whole wheat & 10% Rye. I have used quick acting, instant, & sourdough on different loaves. I have used the 1/4 to 1/2 tsp yeast with cool water & 8-24hr, 72deg 1st proofing as well as the 1 1/4 to 2 tsp yeast with warm water & 1 to 3 hr, 85deg 1st proofing. Everything through this step seems OK, My dough has lots of bubbles and has more than doubled in volume  I degas, fold, & stretch the dough and place in a parchment lined container of appropriate size and shape for my 5qt dutch oven or my superstone bread baker. I give it a second proofing hoping it will double in size again; but it never does! All I ever get with the 2nd proofing is a 10 to 60% increase in volume. I have varied time and temperature to no avail. The better ones  are good and edible but not as light and airy as I would like.  Have wondered about mixing some beer or vinegar with the water. Also wonder about adding baking powder.  Would really appreciate any help! Thank You for any Response!
I love Jenny Jones. ❤️
*Thank you Jeany Can Cook for the Great Recipe 👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏🍁🍁🌺🌺*
Oh my goodness. So happy I found this. Your one of my favorite people. The recipe is great. Thanks. Again I'm so happy I found your page.
Jenny thank you!  I've been making the no knead white flour bread for the past year, WANTING to make wheat since it's supposedly healthier than white flour bread, but not wanting to do alotta work to make it.   THIS recipe of yours was PERFECT!   THIS, my friend, is now my new favorite go-to bread recipe.  I didn't have milk so I used half-n-half and i didn't have white sugar, so I used brown.  CAME.  OUT.  PERFECT!  I wish I could post a pic.   But wanted to say thank you and I LOVE watching your cooking vids and look forward to trying your other simple recipes.  Thats what I like about your recipes - SIMPLE, straightforward and interspersed with your great sense of humor.   Take care!  (PS I really cracked up with the cracked egg in your shirt)   walker, west friendship, maryland
Jenny....  you are the GREATEST OF THE TV SHOWS AND YOUTUBE.  ❤️
😆😂😂...  who’s your daddy...
I love your videos but I see you have no recent ones.  you need to come back your so funny
The egg lolz.
This woman reminds me of my aunt when I was a kid . She was always  cooking and had a great sense of joy in her life . Even though life wasn't that easy, she had  strong ethnic  values that always kept her going. I like that Jenny keeps the cooking simple  so the rest of us can learn to make healthy food without a huge learning curve
Lols 👍
Where are you nowadays Jenny?  I enjoy your humor in your videos Your last video was a year ago 🤔
You're crazy.
Great!!!
One Moment.  Your adding in bread flour or all-purpose flour, so how is this considered whole wheat bread?
I have been working on making some good whole wheat bread, well thanks to coming across ypur receipt,  i made your ww receipt   my loft was not as large as yours,  but it was tasty and i found a great receipt to keep me in wheat delish bread, wado, Jenny for sharing ypur talent, great wheat bread.  Blessings to you and yours
Thanks for the recipe & the scrunch foil idea is just an amazing time saver tip. Thanks again
Hmm, smackin that dough while saying who's your daddy?  LOL!    Jenny's a little freaky too!!
Oh JENNY you are so funny! Love what you do and say! I’ve subscribed!
Egg in a bread? Seriously? Its bread. Not a cake.
I was just waiting for you to cut the bread 🍞 😞
You got me 😂😂
you are soooo funny .....
Oh my goodness...I love your humor!!!
I just love this lady. She is so natural.  Jenny you are a star, thank you you are so genuine and natural. Don't forget Jesus dear HE LOVES YOU AND WANT YOU WITH HIM IN HEAVEN TO BAKE THE BREAD. Bless you.
Nade this bread this evening. Never buying bread again. Easy and very tasty
😂🤣😂 you are funny. Thanks for making me laugh 😂 I
I have a bread machine, a rather less known brand, "Strata".   I paid about $35. for it including shipping.  Its recipe book includes a 50% whole wheat bread.   Jenny's is about 73% whole wheat by volume.  I prefer the whole wheat texture, but I also like a bread that rises well for a lighter weight texture.  Also,  I entered uncharted territory, using a machine rather than kneading by hand.   My machine's program takes 4:05 hours.   The time was not an important factor for me.  I tried it, adding the liquid ingredients, warm milk, whole egg, oil, salt, and sugar first, then the flours and the yeast.  As the dough mixed,  I added a level tablespoon of bread flour.   About four hours later,  I had a fine loaf of 73% whole wheat bread.   It had risen and baked fully, yielding 13, 1/2" slices of light-weight, brown crusted, tasty bread, plus a thinner crown slice.   Thanks, Jenny!   P.S.  My "Strata" produces a vertical loaf, all square slices of the same size, which I prefer.    Instead of "spanking" the dough,  I did some shopping and my laundry.   You can spank me, Jenny!
This nice lady is awesome I love the who’s your daddy comment lol
I made this, we loved it, it's gone!  Thank you, Miss Jenny!  😀
Wow...yummy...thnks for sharing....
Thank you Jenny , for your time making your channel ! You make making bread look easy , and I'm gonna be making bread soon !
How to scramble an egg ! Lol.
America, please stop using stupid units like cups and teaspoons. Everybody has scales in their kitchens, so use grams ffs
Love your new spatulas, and the whole funky colour scheme of your kitchen!
How much 1 cup gram?
I don't buy bread anymore. I'd rather spend my money on spatulas.
I warm my egg in the warm water.
January 2020....smack that dough...my favorite part....Jenny I'm 71 retired and feed 30 alpacas and a donkey every morning (not mine just a great part time 2 hour Job 6 days a week)....surely you can give us a video once a week.....you are loved😍😍😍
Beautiful Bread, also I like that hen on the counter.
The recipes are wonderful and Jenny is soooooo cute and funny
Freakin’ Jenny, you’re SO funny!  😀
I made this and result is sooo good!!!!  I used flex seed powder 1 Tbsp with 3 Tbsp water as an egg substitute.Thanks Jenny for sharing this easy recipe!!👌😱
Can I see you slice the bread and show us what it’s like inside?  It looks aMaZing Jenny! Thanks 😊
I know why you saved your money for the spatulas 🤩 they are lovely and cheerful.
"You're funny" i was about comment it before you joking.  I dont know how me thirty french from Québec manage to see you're video but you're good (My second video)
how do you store the bread to keep it from going stale? Great recipe, thank you so much for sharing!!! 👍😉
Like your recipe. I love humor. Not real crazy about age 10 to 15 yr old humor. God bless you though and your cooking    help. Kw
I like you already Jenny :-) You are so naughty BUT o so NICE xxx Marry Me
too much rise can cause it to fall
Great easy recipe and wonderful presentation! You're adorable!
This is one naughty Housewife..:)
Plz could you tell 1 cup equals how many grams.measurement in grams plz
Can i use 100% whole wheat flour ?
Regarding the eggs, the easiest way to warm them (though I did enjoy your version) is not to keep them in the 'fridge.  There is no need to refridgerate eggs.
how many grammes in a cup?
Hi! Could you please give us measurement by weight? It's more accurate than using measuring cups.
😂who's yr daddy lol many thanks for sharing.
Daddy Jenny
I love  what u make
Can this be done without egg?
Omg! Love your humor.  Awesome.

I been baking cakes for people almost 30 years now and I always enjoy making other things. You make me laugh and your recipes are so good and come out just as you say. Thank you for sharing them. Can't wait to try them all, Teresa.
Bread came out lovely thanks. Can I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour with a multigrain bread flour?
can I omit the sugar, my bread came out way too sweet, will I still get the same result, thanks
You are a hoot.  Can’t wait to try this recipe.
Omg she is so sweet 💕💕💕
It’s my first time baking and it turned out great! Your recipe is so easy to follow. Any plan for a brioche bread soon?
I hear you girl what you say you rather by spatulas and you're right.
Okay, I honestly love your humor and your recipes.
you feel like the fun grandma that I never had!
How was the bread batter prepared a few centuries ago ?
I read "whore wheat bread" whats wrong with me?
I just discover your channel OMG you have AMAZING healthy recipes!!!! I will definitely try the bread and your baked doughnuts!👌🏻👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Can you do a honey wheat bread recipe? 😊
Lol thanks
If you add sugar, milk and ägg , then it will be a cake and not a bread. No , thank you. But, nice teeth  anyway.
Very good sense of humor . You made me laugh . Thank you. I think I will try this recepie.
I wish you'd marry me :-)
Is whole wheat bread flour ok to use?
Hi can i bake mine at 275 degrees for longer.  Will it rise the sane way?
What whole wheat do you use?
JENNY JONES! I miss her!
3:57 whos your daddy
You’re so funny Jenny.
Can you do without milk?
whos your daddy ahaha
You can add a pot with water and omit the aluminum foil, and the steam with also thoroughly cookie.
I will get normal bread in just 5 minutes to the store near me...that would be more easy and relaxing...lol
Love your recipes and love your sense of humor😁
"You got to spank that dough; who's your daddy?!" 😂🤣😍
Lucky egg!
Beautiful lady....❤❤❤❤❤
i dig your show jenny...good tips and you crack me up!! solo dude that likes to cook....thanks doll!!!
Who is your zaddy😂😂
I make our bread. I wouldn’t buy that sorry bread at the store at all. It really is easy, and so much better.
😁😁, i enjoyed the video. Thanks for the recipe
" Gotta spank that dough *Who's your daddy?* " Instant like 👍 😂
Jenny is a scream!! I love your videos. I always thought your talk show was interesting.  You’re even better in kitchen.
Nice 👍
Your kitchen and you are very beautiful and you are very skilled in your work. I enjoyed it very much and thank you very much.
hahahahahahaaa You`re wonderful
You're adorable
I just love you
Gorgeous.  Nice bread too
Jenny u are very funny😁.. will try this recipe out
Bread with an egg! Isn't that a cake? I notice you don't cut the bread to show its texture, hmm.
The easiest way to warm up eggs to room temp is to, place eggs in a small bowl ,add hot faucet water, let sit for 5 minutes...then drain water..
You are so much fun! Can i add sunflower seeds or walnuts? Peace
The secret to slicing bread is warm the knife blade on the stove and she goes right thought the loaf.
Thank you so much Jenny for sharing. God Bless.
Can't do whole wheat ...can I just use all regular flour?
Wow!
Jenny please mention ingredients where u placed a lot of links.love ur recipie Sadaf From pakistan
missing you
It's not how we make bread
375 30 mins
I spanked my first loaf of yeast risen bread to this video today and I must say this was a great introduction to yeast risen breads for someone who has only made Irish Soda bead for his time. Cultural stuff. This was a heck of alot of fun. I did the whole works by hand and kept folding it into a ball like you would with soda bread. It was me, but it was dry. The loaf baked well and this is a fantastic recipe. I had never made a bread with such comlexity as compared to the simplicity of an Irish Soda bread.
Oh wow.. wow ... wow, I'm so thrilled... I baked my first ever perfect loaf of bread!!!! Thanks a lot... n I sure dint forget to spank my dough... who's your daddy?🤣🤣
Haha who's your daddy?🤣😂
I love you speech the egg the daddy joke lol
jenny youre a funny lady
Hi Jenny, thanks a lot for uploading this tutorial. I managed to bake my 1st home made Wholemeal bread today after watching your video. It taste Fantastic. Yeup, I may never ever buy commercial bread ever again.  (Off the Record): I messed up my whole dining area today with flour all over the floor and dining table (coz my kitchen is too small for manual smacking of the dough as I do not have an electric dough mixer). Also I was so scared when my microwave oven (I don’t have an oven as well 🤣) starts making cracking sound the first 3 mins after putting the dough into the microwave oven. But the baking survived till the end (without exploding) 😂🤣
Jenny you are riot😂😂😂😂
The way to a mans heart is through is stomach they said. I’m in strong like after just watching lemon brownies and wheat bread😉
Hey ! What is the height of ur mould?
Luv u Jenny....its interesting n tempting to watch u making nice dishes
Who's your daddy, lmfao. I came looking for bread and found gold.
Yummy
Who’s your daddy?  Ok boomer
Your colorful tools are so cute and cool. I wanna have them soon.
Heres a tip instead of useing tin foil  just put a pan of boiling water on the bottom shelf to keep it from browning to much. Thank you jenn for sharing.
Хочу рецепт на русском 😞
Jenny I love your videos. Of course I know your celebrity status  so realize you have a natural talent for entertainment, but you seem to have it ALL!  I LOVE everything you make and your graphic instructions plus your witty personality is more than I could hope for. PLEASE continue to make more videos. You’re such a natural!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Delicious! And I do not have a mixer. Just used a fork. Cooked in my table-top oven. I kneaded 150 times. Easy-peasy.
No surprises😂
Delicious Jenny. Since I dont have the cleavage I warmed the egg using other means - breaking open the egg and keeping the saucer on a shallow pan with warm water.
Please tell me whether egg is important
Glass cook ( Hen) - Good Day
Like your videos and thank you for sharing, I like whole wheat dread, your bread look very good.
or warm it up in a running warm water!! haha. youre so cute
LMFAO! “Whose your daddy?”
Funny you ma, you can't make me, who's your daddy😊
Hahahahaha. So funny 😂
Hi, can you advise for baking with microwave? Is it advisable?
Wow Jenny made me laugh at the end!
I was wondering if you could throw all this stuff in Bread Maker and cut down you work even more?
I love this recipe! On my 2nd attempt I added 2 tbsp of honey to the milk then heated to 120° it came out awsome!!
👏👏🥚🤯you're funny!
Hello.  My question if I keep kosher.  Is it possible to replace the milk with water ??  I'd love to hear from you.  Thanks
This lady is absolute funny! "was the egg real at the end" ?
Can we add all the ingredients in the regular mixer grinder if we don't have a hand mixer
Ahhhhhhhhhh blahahahahahaha lol I just found your channel! Love, love, love 😍
You're so much fun to watch. You made me laugh with that surprise...Thank you.
I just love Jenny, always makes me laugh, God Bless you always 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘...I’m Italian, always Bless your bread✝️✝️🙏🙏🙏... my Mama taught me that 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️✝️✝️🙏🙏🙏
Awesome :)  Full watch :)
Gosh she is so adorable !
Jenny you crack me up! You're very funny girl! And your recipes are great! Thanks for sharing.
I just made your bread recipe Jenny, and it turned out PERFECT! Thank you
I love you grandma 💕
“What can you do in 15 mins that’s exciting... with your clothes on?”  Got my subscription.

I tried this! But my dough wudnt rise... and i made a mistake not letting it rise the 2nd time before putting in the oven ....
Who's your daddy?😂😂😂😂  I'm single btw.  😜
You are super hilarious
You're like Betty White on the Mary Tyler Moore show. I love her on that show.
What is the best way to store homemade bread?
Is this the " who's your daddy " brand ?
Wow...great recipe. Now, "who is your daddy! Spank that dough..." LOL
You are a riot! New subscriber here!
Thank you Jenny. Hope you are okay and sending good wishes
Jenny is funny. She is a cross between Jessica Lange and Sissy Spacek.
*can i use all purpose flour?*
Hahaha...I love that you are a little naughty 😁
Did Jenny just spank that bread, and say "who's your daddy".
i love making bread but always use lard, and I do everything by hand.  love the video.
jenny, You're awesome!!
Love the ease of it all,,,,,can you freeze the finished loaf for future consumption? I’m a single guy just learning to cook.....just wondering,,,,,,love your stuff,,look forward to all your recipes,,,your the greatest....jim
Miss you Jenny, hope you are okay.  ❤️
Very weird woman.
Thank you!
Yup. Delicious cake, not bread. (Or what they call, "quick bread.) If you're beating a batter like this, you're making cake. If you're making it with milk and sugar/honey, you're making cake.
I must say you are correct. Easiest bread recipe I've ever tried. Turned out perfect. And I have tried many recipes without success.  Thanks, Highly Recommend!
Can I skip egg?
Any substitute of an egg please reply Thanks
Tried it yesterday and turned out fabulous! Thanks
i had totally fun watching this vid hahahahaha
😭😹😹😹😹😹When she stuck that egg in here boobs I cried
Who's your daddy 😅
lol...........very good!  love it!
Jenny!  You are adorable!  So entertaining....AND a great cook!!!
Hahahahahaha I live her super.. 🤗
I know this video is old but had to say, THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE. I have never made a yeast bread and don't have a mixer and this loaf came out perfect. Wish I could show you a picture. Here's a tip for others without a mixer. I mixed with a spoon then kneaded about 150 turns. Rest . After putting the dough in the pan covered it and set it in the microwave with a glass of "hot" tap water for 40 min. Rose wonderfully. Oh I also forgot to warm the egg so I ran hot water over it. Thanks woo hoo I can bake!
This recipe is amazing! This bread is so delicious and healthy that i had to double the quantity. i baked this for the second time without egg! Oh, the spanking helps :D :D
Every video from jenny make me so hungrey kek! The good crunchy taste and especially smell of fresh bread is just the best makes me feel alive. Only deltaparoel music can do the same to me. Sometime I combine the both of them, make me feel alive!
i genuinely watched this video to learn how to make bread... didn't expect the meme part. i knew i saw this women somewere.
Great video. To funny. Have to have humor when baking.
Can you use regular white flour instead of wheat?
Jenny has a wild side ;)
👌👌👌👌👌
You are so lovely and funny Thank you for Share 😀
I'm watching this because my 5 year old  daughter wanted to know how the wheat bread on her sandwich was made....  Now shes just walking around smacking her butt saying "yea smack that dough, who's your daddy" soo... that's cool.  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i like ur colourfull kitchen gadgets  and ur recepi. 😍
Just lower the heat to prevent the outside from get to dark..or put some water in the oven when you put the dough in
Lol, your. Video endings are so funny! Thanks for the chuckle. Lol!
I feed my yeast with honey, Mrs. Jenny. Have you tried feeding your bread yeast with a little maple syrup? I plan to try that next. If anyone has done that please let me know how it went.
Dankeschön
This is 2019 you don't use milk and eggs for bread smh
The egg though! 🤣
Thanks Jenny the whole meal bread was unreally good so easy and the texture is great and you make me smile. Roger England
Love you Jenny
Jenny, you are so delightful. Thank you for bringing so many people joy!!!!
Have to try this
Do you need to add sugar?
Who’s your daddy I’m speechless 😂😂 that’s great
Whoa it just clicked, this is Jenny Jones😁
"spank that dough, who's your daddy."  ;-). 😐😏😕😕😕😕
This is my go-to base for every bread I make. I love it. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful and easy recipe!
There is no difference between the shiny and dull side of foil
So funny 😂 thanks love your bread 🍞
It's a delicious bread. I've made it numerous times.
Made it the first time today. It came out perfect. I was very surprised since my baking skill is bleh... and I never succeeded at making bread before. Thank you!!!
Is there a colour of spatula that you don't have, that you want? :-)
Fresh bread and coffee, so good! Nice receipt!
Zi forgot the warm milk, and the dough after 30 minutes, donnt raises to an inch. Disater.
Whose your daddy had me subscribed you are hilarious great recipe thanks for sharing❤️
Good content
I just remember you I keep thinking where have I seen you before you used to have a talk show Jenny Jones😅😅
Lol. Ich laught so hard. Your amazing. Such a great recipe !!! Thank you
Great bread and great entertainment!! Jenny’s the best!
You are fun to watch :D  Lovely lady! Thanks  for the share!
Lmao....After watching a few of Jenny videos I came to realize ..... Jenny got a freaky side!
Oh my gosh you are hilarious!!! I really thought you were talking to someone and you actually cracked that egg on your chest. LOL LOL LOL!!! Thanks for the video very entertaining!!!
"who's your daddy" got me rolling, "omg you're getting married" made me subscribe. I love you already
How could I incorporate wheat germ into this recipe ? 😌
Simple recipe. Yay!
Omg!  Jenny you crack me up!
"What? You're getting married, OMG! " HAHA HAHA!!!!! LOVE IT !!!!
Hello there, I keep kosher..my question is this.  Is it possible to add fresh water instead of lukewarm milk ??  I'd love to get an answer from you .. Thank you
Thank you for the recipe ♥️ I’ve been making this every other day 😊
3:56 "who's your daddy!?!?!" Im dying here! hahahahah
Made it this weekend and was great.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
instructions very un clear my dog got rolled over by a car ...
What about just a plain white bread recipe?
Who’s your daddy 😂 sub for life after that
One whole pack of yeast for just one loaf?.
😂😂😂 U r hilarious! And cute too!
Found this video while looking for 100% Whole Wheat bread. Hoping you have a video where you don't use the bread flour. Just using the whole wheat flour is where I face the challenge of dough rising.
OMG THIS IS AMAZING IMMA MAKE SMOL BREAD!!!!!!!!!
You shouldn’t put that egg so close to your body....... because it could be hard boiled in just a few minutes 😂
please never stop talking -  you are so hillarious  and smart!  Thank you as always..
Ok your funny Crazy and funny But sadly I've never had success with adding the yeast directly to the mix I've always had to let it bloom in a sugar liquid  I will however give your recipe a try right now
Gosh you're freakishly amusing
Recipe for egg buns: put egg in between the buns and go look for surprises. 😂 😂 😂
I made the recipe and was very pleased. Especially since I am only one who eats it and so one loaf was perfect. One problem. I was disappointed a bit in the flavor, then realized that I used to make WWbread with honey. I will use honey next time, which, I think is a better combination with whole wheat. I hope it does not affect the texture.  I am excited to make ww bread again.
Can this recipe be made with water instead of milk? Thanks.
最后做完面包 开车了哦
I am your daddy
Thanks for sharing is very helpful 👍👍👍👍👍
Jyothi Rao I tried out the bread recipe and it turned out great

Subscribed after "you can't make me" and "who's your daddy" had me thinking I made the right choice😂
I’ve made loaf today for the first time and it came out AS THE BEST ONE EVER. SO SOFT AND FRESH!!! Thank you so much for this recipe!
She's so funny I love her videos!
I tried this recipe and had some wholesome whole wheat bread .It is a foolproof recipe. Thank you Jenny .
How many calories is this?

Hello Jenny,  just wanted to let you know I baked a loaf of bread today as per your recipe and it turned out real good.  Thanks a lot! Love your sense of humour!!
I enjoy your humour! Looking forward to more!
I love your bread 🥖
It's such a pleasure to watch your videos.   You are so sweet and funny.
Spank that dough! Who’s your daddy! 🤣🤣🤣 My dogs came to the kitchen to check on me I was laughing so hard!
I tried this recipe and the bread turned out to be really good. Thank you!
awesome
What if I don’t have multipurpose flower? That second step. Can I skip that and continue just using my whole wheat and he rest of ingredients?
Hi Jenny I've got a question. I would like to make 100% whole wheat. So If I were to replace the 3/4 cup of all purpose flour with whole wheat, do I need to increase the milk or anything??
You are a sick woman. LOL I mean that in a loving way. Very cute and funny. I am just beginning to get into making breads. I have been doing my families cooking for 40 years but I don't "bake". I'm mostly interested with sourdough and milling my own flour. I do like the health benefits of home made sourdough and have decided to teach myself how its done. Packaged Yeast will not store much longer than 3 months and sourdough starter I can keep alive for years and make from scratch a new starter if needed. The Hard Red wheat berries I can store up to 30 years. I researching and learning just how many things can be made with sourdough. I find it very interesting and a bit fun to do. Thanks for the video Jenny, you inspire me to make breads.
Just made this bread and it turn out perfect. I used a larger loaf tin & had to let it rise for 1 hour instead of 35 minutes. thanks Jenny for the recipe
Jenny i just made your breed and it is fabioulas my goodness this great taste good. Hhhhmmmmm lekkerrrrr
Your realy amazing May God cont to Bless you and inspire more ladies as us to homecooking food is the best than outside restaurants you know what your putting in your pot . Love ya to Bits Jenny God Bless. I am a vet and just replace soms of the ingrediënt with otter stuff. 😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚

Lmao. She is so funny!
WHO'S YOUR DADDY? *spank*
I have the same mixer, but for some reason the attachments, like the dough hook keep hitting the bottom of the bowl when I turn it on high.
Jenny i love you
Jenny Jones you are hilarious!  Love all your videos with such delicious recipes. Thank you and PLEASE keep making them!!!
Hand mixer does good job 👍
omg!!!!!!! this woman is hilarious!!!! I just love her. I love the way she cooks and it's really good. She should have her own tv cook show. you go girl!
New subscribers and I love watching your videos
Who is your daddy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😁😁
LMAO!!! I almost Died laughing when she started spanking the dough and said who's daddy.
Who's you're daddy!?!  😂
Dear Jenny, I'm very eager to try this but we don't eat eggs. Could you suggest a replacement may be?
Me: hmmm i wanna make some bread. *finds iconic meme* *surprised pikachu face*
Can you add Honey
First video I watched of yours and I love it. Yummy looking bread and funny humor too. Thanks Jenny
Is there a vegan version of this?
Would it be better to use parchment paper to line the pan ?
You say stuff that's so unexpected. 😂
Add two TPS. of honey too make bread more moist.
Can you please tell me what kind of whole-wheat flour did you use in this recipe? Here in canada, our Indian grocery stores have different kind of whole wheat flour which is actually a very fine flour. Can I use that one in this recipe?
Jenny thank you so much for your baking tips you make my heart smile! Take care now bye bye
I had trouble getting the smashed egg out of my bra, and into my mixer, but the bread turned out perfectly !!!  Thank you Jenny !!!
Can you use a cast iron pan?
Can you use for just white bread?
0:12 weird flex but okay
Finally I found this wonderfull channel
No thumb up because you didnt show us inside 😕
Lmao...
I make whole wheat bread with her no knead recipe and it comes out great.
😍
Hahaha love the dry jokes. It's dry but you can drink it 😂😂😂
"Who's your daddy" gave her away. You know what i mean.
I was amazed!  I baked bread in 90 minutes!  It didn't last long! And you have a great sense of humor!
I just tried this recipe and it is so simple. It is really delicious and moist! Do you think I could double the recipe to fit the mixer?
Is there any ways to make it in a micro wave oven ??
Thank u jenny of the excelent whole wheat bread bravo.

What do I do if I used the kind of yeast that needs water first? How much water does it need? Or can I mix the yeast with the milk?
I love you personality
Mine did not really rise as much I wonder why? I rose it for a whole hour
Sugar really? Isnt the point of whole wheat to keep your carbs in check? Phew
You are hilarious!!!
My mom (fantastic, amazing cook), says she uses this wonderful recipe and she loves it.  She says once I try it I won’t use anything else!   I was so surprised to see it was Jenny Jones, one of my all time favorite celebrities.  This is so fun, subscribe button hit and I’m ready to go....🤗
Thank​ you.so much​ madam​
New subscriber. Really enjoyed this tute. I thought I was the only cook with soooooooooooo many spatulas......😂🤣😅..... Made my roll recipe today.....will add this recipe to my custom collection 🌹
I did it ,,, it works  for me but I wonder if you can double it  to make two loaves of bread?
I wonder if you can  double  everything  an make 2 loaf,s ? Anyone  know????
Amazing, so helpful thanks for sharing ❤️
This was my first bread (besides banana bread) and it came out GREAT! The only thing I did differently was use all purpose flour and ground flaxseed, everything else was the same. The crust was beautiful, it made a fantastic turkey sandwich and stood alone with just a pad of butter... just so good. Thank you so much for sharing!! I'm keeping this one!
Thank you for this recipe...Can you make white bread this way? ♡♡♡
Bread is alchemy.

I'm making this bread now. The hook, or kneading attachment, worked well for me because I used a spatula to scrape the bottom and side of the bowl regularly.  Mixing time took a lot longer than 2 minutes, though.
I am doing it for the third time! Never fail, Always perfect ! Today i am using oïl oïl because is all i have ( i use butter to coat the Bottom of my pan and i notece that the crost test wonderful ! I lieve in France ( on the board of Germany )  and we have many colds day that i do not feel going out to the Bakery. Thank you Jenny for this nice and super easy recipe You are truly amazing!
Jenny you are amazing. Love your simple ways of working, & your humor,  :-)
Please delete the sugar  we don’t need the calories.
Hi madam, today i tried this bread. It turns out sooo good.  Every one liked in my family. Thank you for the recipe. 🙏❤🙏
Is this the same Jenny Jones from when I was a kid? Tv show
Very nice 👍
Oh why didn't this work for me. I have ended up with an uncooked hard lump of I don't know what to do about
Can you make this bread with out salt and sugar
Jenny...I can’t remember where I know you from.  I worked in NY for the bank or I know you from right here in Florida.
I have a machine that's better n you're a....😝
I love the timer!!!!  Where can I find one!!!  Soooooo cute.....I love spats, too!!
hey i m veg. so what can i use instead of egg
Love her
LOL Silly Rabbit tricks are for kids. I will have to try this Jenny. Thank you for the smiles.  Angel from The Bay
Ifound your videos  A while ago .. I could not figure out why you looked so familiar. You are Jenny Jones!!! you said once on your show that you can cook .. well yes you can! love your videos!
you r very pretty
U do a great job. I'm not afraid of making it
Everything went well until I tasted it...very bland flavor.
god damn, jenny jones. this takes me back 25 years lol
Thanks so much for the delicious bread. My husband made the most  amazing bread with your instructions for Mother's Day gift!
I made this bread with white flour because I didn't have wheat. It turned out delicious 😍
This lady is quite strange
What a woman...
Can I avoid adding egg?
Is the salt necessary?
I made this at high altitude, in Denver, CO - a mile high.  It doesn't need the extra 1/4 cup of flour after beating because it was in a mass.  Also I used coconut milk rather than dairy milk.  Came out just fine.
I made this bread, and it was crazy beautiful and good.
I tried this recipe n it came out good n very tests God bless you n keep it up for us
"Who's your daddy?" Hahahahaha
Lol you kitchen looks so colorful like a silicon showroom
Are you able to give the nutritional value for this bread? It’s an amazing bread recipe.
You are so funny <3
Hi Jenny! For the milk, will soy or almond milk work?
Thanks Jenny, you are cheerful...
She is awesome! Her recipes really do work as she demonstrates and she's funny, too.
I love it superb 2 cups of wheat  and 1 cup of maida?
Made it three times. Doing everything right. I tried active dry yeast and rapid rise instant yeast. It doesn't come close to 1" above the pan after 35 minutes. Nor does it rise anywhere near that high after baking. WHAT am I doing wrong?
I did it it Worked
Thank you so much. Xx
This is now my favorite bread making show lol
So this is where the meme came from lol
hehe, that's a good ol bread!!! i like yah, gurl!
GOTTA SPANK THIS NOW WHO'S YOUR MOMMY TELL IT!!B
I found your recipe a delight, plus your witty banter, you should try comedy. Thank you Ms. Jenny
Jenny please give me ressipi  in English
Good so fant
Can we use parchement paper instead of using tin foil?
3:56
U forgot to cut it babe we wish to see inside
Jenny I am soooo happy to see you!!! I used to watch your talk shows and loved your personality!!   Can’t wait to try your recipes!!!  ❤️ you!!!!
Dough is very sticky for me as well, especially when using all purpose flour. Need to add lots of additional flour just to roll it out. Otherwise, the video is very helpful. Thank you!
Thanks for sharing.  Have been looking for this recipes
I've made allot of bread, but I cannot get this dough to come together with your recipe. It's so sticky after 50 turns you can't touch it. I've added more flour, and it still will not come together!
Buying,. In shops...they make in bulk...it's cost effective....but home made is good....once
Electric power consumption for one bread 30minutes...is expensive
Very nice
Great recipe i make this 2 or 3 times a week. But instead of covering it with tin foil i just put a pan of boiling water on the bottom rack. And i wish the ruler didn't come out to measure the rise i think most people  know how much a inch is. Thanks for sharing
I dont have a stand mixer...but making and kneading bread is really fun. Get to feel the texture to know when to start proofing
Kirsten Dunst looks so aged now 🤔 Thanks for this vid mam
Where do You get Your Colorful things that You use to cook with? ie.. plastic that You were kneeding on ect...?
Good
"Who's your daddy?"
Thank you 👍
Ha, ha, ha...
The last part,,the breaking of the egg is really hilarious and cute...
Love your work, u r fabulous woman
The last part.😂🤣😂
This came out so good, thanks for an easy and tasty recipe=)
LOL! Who’se your daddy? 👌🏼
Who's yuh daddy 😂🤣😂🤣I love this lady with a passion 💜 best in the world!
what brand of bread flour do you use?
good job thank you
Lord Jesus, I just watched her spank some bread and put an egg in her bra. I'm dead.
Jenny where are you?  All your fans like me miss your wonderfully explained recipes.  They always turn out perfect.  Would you please consider doing more videos maybe 1-2 a month?  It would thrill us so much. Your fan always.
Thank you💐🌹💜🙏
Can I make that Bread without Yeast?
Looks a very doable recipe. will try tomorrow. By the Way I love the rainbow of colors in your kitchen....so nice and refreshing...
spank your dough...who's your daddy....lol...I think Jenny is a closet freak
I miss you Jenny!
I thought making  bread was very difficult but it wasn't
Haahaha haahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the last scence 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I would love to follow you and your cooking🐾
I love your colorful Happy kitchen, thank you for the video's you have done, really enjoyed them.  I'm retired as well, enjoy your time. Don't feel guilty at all...... I'm excited to start gardening.....
You are a hoot Jenny, thank you for the recipe and for making me smile 😊👍
Do you have a recipe for sourdough bread?
I love your personality.. fun to watch.
I can tell shes a freak 😉 lol
how much do you really NEED it?
The egg bit got me to sub! So very funny!
More videos! More videos!  More videos! I just love em. You bring a lightearted take that I truly enjoy. Been a fan even when you were on tv.
I found you don,t need a foil tent just boiling water in the oven and the ruler to measure the height of the bread was a a little much.lol Good recipes though
That was so funny when you said who's your daddy!
Lol! You're funny thanks for the broadcast!
Did you say "Who's your Daddy!!!" 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
I've never made bread before, tried this recipe today and my husband loved it!  Turned out perfectly.....Thank you for posting it.  :)
Jenny can I us just flour in this recipe love all your color untiles were do your get all them
Jenny you are so cute, thank you for the awesome recipes!!
Wat can be the best substitute for egg??
You are such a trip,🤗I am entertained while learning your wonderful recipes! Thank you ☺️🙏🏻👩‍🍳
Bless you! This bread is fantastic! I mixed it by hand—2 minutes in the bowl then 150 turns on the counter. Thanks for including directions for doing it by hand. This was so easy. I’ll never buy bread again!!
A lot of dough will buy a lot of  bread. Jenny more videos, retirement is for old fogies like me.
Loved this video! The egg warming part was so hilarious😀👍
Hi dear Jenny , I have used this recipe and also shared it with my family in Dubai. We love it , you made it so easy. Thanks a lot and wish you the best 🙏🏻♥️💐
Forever funny blonde...love her show
I notice Jenny doesn't like to reply.  It was very disappointing that you didn't slice your bread.  And yes, what a coincidence because I decided to fix my bread that happens to be the same technique using only one rise in the bread pan.  But my bread did get a period of rest because I had to do something else really quick before I put it in the pan, maybe 5 minutes.  Since I'm in a cooler environment I had to let my bread rise longer..  But, my bread was made almost exactly like your bread except mine was a barley white bread.  And like yours it continued to rise after baking.  But after I baked it, I'm not so sure if I like my bread that fluffy so I may go back to the 2 rise method.     I've learned how to read my dough and make adjustments if there are adjustments need to be made so I don't have to put flour on my board.  Yeah, the dough will stick to your fingers which you have to scrap off but eventually it stops sticking to your hands and boards when kneaded long enough. I'm not fortunate enough to have a nice Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer so I knead for 10 to 12 minutes.  Actually what I would love to have is a KMix stand mixer with the Kn Tool.  This tool should have been on the market by now.  Damn its been long enough.     Anyhoots, I now have your whole wheat recipe in my file and will definitely be making it.
"Who's your daddy?" You're hilarious. Love your videos and style of cooking and baking.
👌
😂😂😂 you are Awesome lady !!!love the recipe!!
First video of yours I've ever seen and I'm in love after that spank haha
Spank the bread, whose ya daddy and adding some cleavage, baking just got a whole lot hotter!
Great-looking bread!! Your humor is contagious!! 🤣🤣
So I’ve ruined two batches so far. Every time I add the milk, the whole thing seizes up, turns into concrete and stops my mixer. What am I doing wrong? Is my milk too cold maybe?
I love your recipes, you are so entertaining:)
Good morning Jenny, I love your videos and you are Sparky nature. And your beautiful colorful kitchen accessories 😋😁 I want to make this bread but I'm not going to use sugar. I did make the no knead artisan bread and it was fabulous!! no more bought bread for me or my mama!!🤗🤩 thank you so much for taking the time and sharing and caring.  Warmest regards 😘 Theda Renee
Jenny I followed your instructions and the bread came out great, thanks!
Very very nice and easy recipe:) The result was fantastic! It is now my favorite homemade bread recipe! Thank you Jenny!
Still looking beautiful Jenny
I just found your videos! Love! and you are so stinking cute and funny!! :)
I made this today and sister Jenny it is a new house favorite here💙!! This recipe was super easy and I had to use a bit more flour cause I'm on the Big Island Hawaii it turned out perfect! Your all aces sweetheart 💋👍🌈🌴🌺💜🎉 Mahalo for sharing 😘
You're funny, like your recipes.
Beautiful!! Thank you..now my wife doesn't have anymore excuses...😉
We watched your video and made your wheat bread the same day. Ours took a bit longer to rise because our yeast was not the rapid kind. We baked and tented the bread and it came out beautifully. Ours was a little difficult to remove from the pan, but it finally came out just fine. I may use parchment paper next time. It looks just like the bread in the video!!! Thanks!!
What if in 30 minutes the bread doesn't rise?
wow that bread looked amazing x
Why am I just discovering this channel? I grew up watching your talkshow. I love love love this channel.
The worst recipe I've ever used. The dough is sticky although you add plenty of flour. DO NOT TRY IT!
That bread looks fantastic.  You alluded to a butter, margarine, or some cooking oil that you use and I didn't quite hear the name of it.  Could you please tell me what it is
You're the cutest! 😂😋
Can I use a glass pan???
Why does everyone spank the dough? 😂😅
This bread is nice thank u
Haaa haaa.... 🤓🤓 (Egg)
Wow u have so many of spatulas..😍😍
Bravissima
Best recipe ever!!!!....i tried dis and came out wonderful...iam from Trinidad and Tobago...so look at how far her amazing recipes and her beautiful personality has reached
I make this all the time and it always turns out great. My family loves it. I refuse to buy store bought wheat bread because this is so good and easy to make. Thanks Jenny!
Do u have to put the egg??
My first bread lesson gonna make this Saturday. ..💖💖💖
Nice bread
Good video and straight forward. Love the end :). Bout fell off the couch from laughing
Beautiful bread!!
It turned out awesome 🤗 thank you! No more $5 a loaf of bread, from now on we make our own!
I used to watch the Jenny Jones show in college in the 90s. Good to see her on YouTube now.
lol....too cute
Sugar ? Milk ? Egg ? 😁
Thank you! This was simple, fast, and helpful.
Jenny, you're one kinky mama,  'who's your daddy'   hilarious.  you use 7 Gramms   and then switch to 'non metric'  Fahrenheit . . . .  I must try the bread.
Signora potrebbe mentre parla dire anche le dosi nel video,poi magari uno va a leggersi la ricetta  non crede???? Internet un mondo dove si bada solo alle visualizzazioni
I wish you would do videos more often 😊
Wow thanks
i love the mini mixer it is so cute and the spatulas are nice colourful
You make me laugh and your recipes are great and easy!
Jenny since you're  so smart,  how come you use outdated   " Fahrenheit " ?  the world is on the Metric System.     I'm going to try the recipe anyway    " don't make me come over  now " ha ha
I rather use honey not surger.
You’re hilarious lol
this bitch is crazy and i love it
Do you have to add milk? Can you use water instead
Could you put honey in this bread i love honey wheat bread
Lol  whos your daddy !!😂😂
Your so amazing
Sorry to hear you have decided not to make more programmes. Just tried this recipe seems to be going OK. Needed some conversion to UK weights and temperatures but I hope you are well and enjoying retirement. Best wishes.
My dough is in the oven in spite of the fact that it didn't really rise (I don't want to waste my expensive flours. This is the second one of her recipes that is not coming out as I had hoped. I do not know what I am doing wrong :-/
OMGosh! I cannot stop laughing. You are too funny. We folks who raise chickens usually call that a "pocket omelet" but in your case it is a, umm, well I will just leave it at that. Will have to try this bread even though hubby is on a low carb diet for his diabetes. Looks too good not to make.
Hey Jenny I use to watch your Talk show with my Mom, now I watch your cooking show. I like it, you keep it simple, but great recipes and technique. Big fan
Who's your Daddy while giving it a good spanking very good I love your bread making skills.
Thank you for all the wonderful moments
Hahahha OMG i like uuu 😂😂
Hi  What can I use instead of eggs?
Jenny I love you and your recipes.
Why my dough is super sticky?
I just found you. I love you already 🤣😂🤣
I have to get away from White flour, which I only like if it is home made.  I love this recipe!  I have also learned how to knead, because I have watched you, and you take the intimidating part out of it.  Thank you!  You sure can cook (and bake!), Jenny!
I enjoy your personality is so fluffy.
Thanks for this, turned out awesome. Your timing is on point!
Butter and honey on top when it comes out.
Not rise it longer. Raise it longer.
Poke w fork holes, 6 jabs before 35 min rise
I add butter, egg, pink salt lots of seeds honey a lil molasses.
Thanks for the video, What would be the quantity of regular yeast please? Can yeast be stored in the freezer, can it be brought back to life after?
Jajaja. Thanks again.
Hi Jenny, I wanna thank you so so much for the clear, simple and awesome instructions on making a bread.After following the recipe i made this...I am so happy .....
I absolutely love the way you joke when cooking, I am like that myself. Subscribed and off to see more!
I am making this bread right now. I, too, love bread and the smell of fresh baked bread is a favorite. Thank you, Jenny! I am enjoying these videos!
I need an egg lol
Very nice thanks please cocco bread
The end was so funny 😆.. I had so much fun watching your video . I can’t wait to make my bread👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👌🏽😉👌🏽
i love that bread easy to follow the recipe
I love your personality. Because of that, I am subscribing. ❤️
It’s 👌 okay! I love watching your repeats and I laugh at your jokes all over again!😂😂
🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞
Hahahaha soooo funny Thnxs dia alot
You re so funny! Love the recipe and your personality
You rock. Cute too.
nice and very easy method.. and your way of teaching is excellent.. Thanks
Haha....lol....haha...how did i know you was going to put that egg right there....you are so funny...and i learn so well ...thank you...and never change💜💜💜💜
Love your recipes and your humour.
Good bread is not about how fast you do It, but about how slow you do it.
Jenny,  I just like your spirit.
You are so funny. And you can cook...good stuff I might add. Thank you, Jenny
Three and a half years later and still getting likes. I know you tubers who practically beg people to like their videos and here you have people begging you to make more 😃
😊👍
I laughed at the end of your video 😁😂
Spank that bad boy real good! 😂😂😂
Hi… can I add in pumpkin? I'm trying to find a wholemeal pumpkin bread recipe.
I like your cooking but dislike sexual suggestive stuff. Like egg down shirt, not a good look.
nice job Jenny.
Bread looks awesome like the round loaf I made over the weekend - Does ANYONE know a way to slice the 🍞 bread evenly - I’ve done such a hatchet job trying to cut my bread it’s the only reason I buy bread ...??
Hi Jenny! I have been experimenting for the past week on trying to make a ‘lite’ in carbs bread as the Quebec company that produces a nice wholewheat loaf with some pea hull fibre in it, will not deliver to our area of the province of Ontario any more. Plenty of really cranky ,on-a-diet -and -this -is- the -only -bread -allowed -for -sandwich peeps out there now!! Lolol! I am going to try and use a 12” long pan x 4” and see if I can reduce the size of loaf per serving this way while making a nice  fluffy loaf. I think,having watched this fab video(God I would love to see you cook with Joanne Lumley and Dawn French!!) I will skip wheat gluten and see how it goes with the multigrain flour I am presently using. Thanks for keeping me motivated to keep trying! Hugs,Deb
Good recipe. For those counting calories, here's what I computed: the whole loaf is about 1700 calories. Slicing into 12 pieces makes each slice about 142 calories.
I never thought I'd get this turned on by watching a cooking video.
I miss see you on tv. You have not aged. Love your recipes ☺️
Can I do this recipe with Spelt flour?
Wow, it really worked! Soft and smooth on the inside, brown and crusty on the outside! My husband and I loved it! I used an aluminum pan, and greased it, as stated in the printed recipe. PERFECT! Thank you, Jenny!
Haha ur so adorable , love your colorful kitchen!
Oops good processor
Can you use a good processor
Great work. Thanks. :)
Can anybody help??? Iv baked this before perfectly but didn’t work so well this time.  Was it because I used different oil because that’s all I can think of that I used differently.  Any suggestions???
Lol! Always funny Jenny J.
Is black flour is  complete grain flour or there is differance ?
How long do you let it sit in the pan or do you take it out right away and do you put olive oil on the top of the crust while it's warm? My bread is so dense I can barely eat it on the second day because I listened to a Julia Child's recipe which said not to leave it sticky at all and to continue to add flour while you're beating it to death to keep it dry while using the dough hook on the mixer! I am so upset. I knew better and listened anyway.
Terrific series of recipes Jenny,   i do not cook much being alone ,but really  love  your  enthusiasm and  ability . you  are  an excellent  cook and entertainer,  ..Norman
Can you tell me if I can replace the whole wheat flour with plain bread flour for a white bread loaf.? Thanks. PS: love all your videos.  The half Polish baker
You are absolutely delightful Jenny...Thank you for your expertise ! (Your spatula collection cracks me up-Love them !)
Jjaja gooood 👌🍞
I done! sooo yummy bread I will addicted this bread easily, Thank you so much
JENNY IS THE BOSS!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ #SPANKTHATGOUDH
the last part will be well remembered than the bread it self.. please don't do that again jenny.
To make this white bread do we just sub out the two cups of whole wheat flour with all purpose flour? For a total of 2 cups of white flour plus that little bit?
It looks delicious why didn't you slice it so we could see
Great recipe thank you very much 💐
Jenny you are something else.!!!
Love you Jenny....💞💞💞
Oh wow the bread  looks delicious
Happy New Year wishing U the best Jenny ...ms yr talk show
You are amazing. I will try your bread recipe.
You are so pretty Jenny. I would love to come home and find you in my kitchen.
You can really cook, love you.
Love it!
I just made this bread! And OMG! I was mind blowing to be delicious! Thank you for sharing your recipe. Btw, how to store the freshly made breads after cooling?  Thanks a lot
How about just putting the egg in some warm water???? Too many smashed eggs in the coat pocket visiting the farm.
Lol..thanks recipw
Fantastic!  With a recipe like this (and watching you make it), I've lost whatever apprehension I still had about making and baking a loaf of bread!  Thank you so much for taking the time to share your expertise with your viewers.  Nice little trick on how to bring an egg to room temperature; so funny too! :)  I understand the part about being retired, I'm retired too and love every minute of it, but I believe the reason you have so many fans is simply because you are a 'natural' if I ever saw one; it's not given to all but you sure have it.  With sincere appreciation, from Montreal, Canada. :)
3:58 this ladys savage
Hi Jenny! Well, thanks to your joyful personality and wonderful wit, I'm gonna give this a try. Be well and thanks again!
Tnx so much jenny
You, my little chickadee, are just too cool. I really, really enjoy your videos and have learned so very much by watching them. Thanks a million.
Omg I just clicked onto this not realizing this is Jenny Jones! Theee Jenny jones of the prime time of talk shows that played at night! I sure do remember those little hooligans going to boot camp. Lol I was probably 13 watching all her shows!
I can only picture in my head the MAD tv version of jenny jones now and forever... she was more like jenny jones than jenny jones (is that possible?). Jenny, I will help you make more videos for free since you don't have a staff... I LOVE your videos... food network should have given you your own show... even if you never make another video we appreciate the ones we got... thank you!!!!!
I have q wheat allergy. Do you have a recipe suggestion?
Hmm. Followed recipe. 10 minutes barely rised. I figured another five mins. Well. It did rise a little. I followed the pat and roll and place in my bread pan. 30 mins  not even half way up my pan, 45 mins. Nope.  So I am guessing this recipe isn't for me. Wheat is hard to make and rise anyways. But not doing the first rise. Just didn't work for me. I've got a lump of hard dough.  Can't cook this. It will be. Brick
You really have a good sense of humor. I love watching your videos. 🇵🇭
This woman is an absolute gem oh my god
Anyone with hands in food should not wear Nail Polish. Gross
If you had whole food plant based recipes, you’d be the most popular bread maker in YouTube!
Lol omgoodness lol your so adorable
Your awesome lady 😙😙😙😙
Just made this bread on my new KitchenAid mixer I received for Christmas.  Turned out perfectly, I followed the recipe and the timing exactly, no adjustments made.  Thank you for a fabulous recipe!
Awww You are to cute..  Thank you sweetie
I've never made bread before and your recipe looked so easy I have my first loaf in the oven now! Thank you so much for sharing my husband and I love your sense of humor.  Merry Christmas Annie and Andy
i think i love this lady 😂she is funny
Jenny. I had never made whole wheat bread. My mom made them when I was young. I am now 72 and decided to try it since my husband and I only eat whole wheat.  Now that  I am retired, I am enjoying the time baking.  FYI and other nay sayers, my bread load turned out EXCELLENT!! my hubby loves it. we will now use this instead of buying bread.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!
Love your humor and your spatulas!!!
I've baked a lot of loaves in the past few decades but I've never had whole wheat bread turn out so great. Thank you Jenny for your excellent guidance. Now, if you can find the time, could you please do up a recipe leaving out the calories?
I like eeg place hhhhhh:))))))
You r so funny! Did you really cracked that egg? Of coarse nooot.
Tasty lookin bread 🥖 Jenny‼️🍃🌺🍃
i have tried making this bread more than 10 times and it came out so good
Love this recipe....Thank you
Great receipt plus you crack me up laughing!😄
Great recipe.
I tried it and it came very well!! Thanks so much...
can we do this without egg?
what type of thermometer do you use for your water/milk?  Noticed my oven is off about 10 degrees. I'm guessing I make it higher?
A fan of yours for all the years you have been visible.  You are one talented lady, the recipes and simple way you approach things (like real cooks do) is awesome.  Speaking of awesome, this recipe for WW bread is perfect, makes great toast too!  Stay well and happy, you certainly deserve it.  Hope you post a video once in a blue moon.  Merry Christmas.
Lololol!!! So funny!!!! 😄
OMG!!!!! u r soooo funny.
I use bread machine for kneading. I set the cycle for dough or French bread for 2 lbs. it becomes soft. I then cover with wet to dry towel and let it rise in the oven under pilot light. I then stretch and fold and place on wax paper to rise while the oven heats
Looks great. Has anyone ever done this with non dairy creamer, or rice dream or almond dream? (Also you can quickly bring eggs to room temp by putting them in a bowl of 110° water for a few minutes.  $
7:16 I’m crying 😂😂
I always so enjoyed Jenny's videos and learned quite a bit (even at MY age!).  Sorely miss the videos.
I have never been so jealous of an egg in all my life
love your bread recipes..BUT..you've got the foil idea wrong. you want tge dull side out to deflect the heat and not brown surfaces of foods. 😆💜
Goodness you are something else
I like how you identify that people may not have all the nessesary kitchen wares
now i can make breads and sell them on the market thanks
🤣😂😆
I made this some months back and it was great
I like you.
Aaaah She's a saucy lady lol. Had me in stitches with the spanking and then a preview of the next video starts with "What can you do that's exciting in 15 minutes.... With your clothes on?" LMAO!!!!!
Jenny I love watching your cooking videos. However I have a question. Can I use gluten free all purpose flour. I am gluten intolerant and I love bread but I can't eat bread with gluten in it. And what other kind of oil that I can use other than olive oilor canola oil? As I have sensitivity to these things as well. Sincerely Kim.
is this jenny jones from the Jenny Jones show from the 90s??
I was searching for a whole meal bread recipe and I came across your video. Very easy recipe to follow and very entertaining at the same time. My 6 year old daughter had a good giggle about the egg. Can't wait to try this recipe. Thank you for sharing
Thankyou so much love 💕
Hi Jenny, can I substitute egg with pumpkin puree or chia seeds n how much should  it be? Thanks.
Can I use almond milk? Or yogurt?
Jenny Jenny what can I say another great video I'll have to try this one when I get home in Ohio I'm in New York now watching it. Please keep these great videos coming the bread looks awesome.......J.R.

New subscriber!  I found your channel yesterday and can’t stop watching!  You are AWESOME!
I've been looking for a perfect bread recipe...this is it! PERFECT!! The flavor & texture - ooolala!!!  It's light & fluffy-not heavy & dense. I had no wheat flour so used basic self rising-mixed & kneaded by hand because I enjoy touching my foods. It just came out of the oven. I .couldn't resist slicing off the end to eat while it was hot YUUUUMMMMM!!!!!!   It's quick & easy so I'll be making it every couple of days. Next loaf I'll add honey & oats-loaf after that dried tomatoes & maybe tarragon. THIS IS A FUN BREAD TO MAKE!! THANK YOU & YOU'RE A BLAST!!!!
Who’s your Daddy lmao!!!!
Lmao
Made it twice.  So easy to make and so good 😊!  I love your recipes.  Thank you.
OMG, you awesome and sooooooo funny!!!!!
Blessed Goodnight do I have to put in a egg?
"Who's you're daddy?!!" Lol, brilliant!👌
you're adorable
Hi Jenny, my dough doesn't rise after the last proofing. It rises just above the baking tin and then sink to 3/4 of the tin? What is the problem? Please advise.
This lady is hilarious!
may I know whats the shelf life for a bread like this...one..two or maybe three days?...thanks great video...
You aren't done till you spank and say "who is your daddy" by the way thanks helping me make my own bread every time I need one.
Who's your daddy.. now every time i make a dough i always ask it.. ROFL..
she's adorable- love how she tries to joke around- bless her. just like my grandma
😁
ha ha ha you very funny
I see you spank that dough. I subscribe. I am a simple man.
Jenny, you are amazing! Thank you so much for sharing your recipes! 👍🏻❤️
I loved
I had to let mine rise longer(humidity and such) Are you still alive??
Jenny .. Love to try this!!  Have you ever used Honey instead of sugar,, and have you put sesame seeds on the top? Many years ago, my neighbor showed me how to make whole wheat bread, and it was sooo freakin' good! I remember her using those two things. I wondered when you should put the seeds on top-using butter, and if you would use less milk if you use a tablespoon or two of Honey?  The bread was just slightly sweet, but definitely made a difference!   I came back to add a question...  I just re-watched some of the video, and wondered if you've warmed cold milk in the micro, to see how long till it reaches the 130 degree temp? I don't have a gage.
3:57 LMAOOOO
Nice thanks :-)
Jenny you are fab...your sense of humour ..... The way to go, 👍
Jenny, did you retire?  I haven't seen anything new and I miss your videos.  You!re a hoot and you make my day. Hope to see you soon.
U r silly! But i love the recipe! Gonna bake bread right now!
thank you so much! sure easy :)
This might change my life! Ill let you know after 4pm... I too want to not buy bread...
So funny
You're fun😍😍
Hi Jenny. I remembered when you were a talk show host. You look great with a spatula❤️🎂👑
Whose ur daddy + cleavage xD make me think twice what's going on... Hahaha.. Nice vid
Hahaha, you are awesome, and I need to buy some spatulas too.
Iwant to say thank you for sharing your information. I used your recipe without mixer, I took it longer than you  and finally we have safe and yummy homebred.
LOL! I love your video's
Enjoyed your video. Thank you. Love that you cook with a normal personality no stupid sayings or corny jokes. Plus it’s always fun to watch a cougar cook.
.   ..
You're hilarious, it's like if Betty White had a cooking channel.. LOL
XD you just made me laugh
Most guys don’t have cleavage but will try your method.
I want only whole wheat recipe no all purpose
This is such a great recipe! I wonder though if I can make an adjustment to allow it to keep just a little longer. It may be the way I am storing it but mine tends to dry out at the edges the next day. Maybe add more oil? Also, I wonder if this recipe would work with just bread flour to make a white sandwich bread? Has anyone tried? Thanks you for the video!!
Any videos Jen Can cook on cooking raw beets?
Great video! I tried this recipe and it makes a beautiful loaf. But it stuck to the tin (even tho it was a nonstick tin), ripped the bottom off the bread when I took it out. I'm so disappointed!! So heads up to anyone, wipe a teensy bit of oil in your tin before you put the dough in to prove. If the bottom is soft when it's finished you can take the loaf out of the tin and put it back in the oven for 10 mins to crisp up 👍🏼🙂
As always it looks easy. But the most fun it's just listening to you , very very funny. Thank you for the recipe and for the laughs.
*smiles*   why is it you want to "smack" the dough ......"who's your daddy?!"
Jenny, I'm new to baking, but what is the purpose of all purpose flour or could u skip it? Sorry maybe a dumb question, but like I said new to baking.
🤓
Your a beautiful and funny woman a real pleasure to watch your videos thanks!
i love u Jenny
The egg in the bra?! What is happening?! Glad I got the bread recipe though.
Going to Kohl's and get a mixer this week. Can't wait to try this
Hello, recipe looks great! TFS! Would love to give it a go... but I have a quick question- is it possible to make this recipe without the egg (or substitute it with something else) and still have the bread be soft?  I'm trying to avoid consuming eggs... Thanks so much! Appreciate your help.
I'm
I am searching an easy recipe for whole wheat bread making, then I see this aged but full loaded with funniness, cordiality and homie sense. Thanks for the recipe, especially the cleavage part and R.I.P to that cracked eggs.
Put the egg in warm water and your egg will be at room temperature in 10 minutes.
Damn, that's a good ass loaf 👌👌👌
Hi Jenny, love your show!!  If one is allergic to eggs, what can we substitute it with?    This is far far the fastest recipe I’ve seen. Not sure where you are, but I recon warm and humid. 😄
Hi jenny, I m from India. I watched Ur videos they are amazing n want to try it but I don't have oven, but I have microwave. So can u plz guide me how to cook in microwave with temperature n timing. Plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz waiting for your reply.plzzz
😆😆 I love your cooking ❤️.. From Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭
i knew she was a freak
ifb microwave use  baking  recipes
Reluctant YouTube star!! I made 2 of your bread recipes and my family loved them. Your instructions are so simple and clear; it would be hard to mess it up.  Have you ever baked with Einkorn flour? I would love to see a future bread video using Einkorn. Enjoy retirement (but not for too long)... love from Louisiana
Love you humor,  oh yes your instructions too.
Oh my god you are getting married 😂😂
I made it and it came out excellent Now question Are you using egg as a binder agent or for leavening agent? What do i do if i dont want to use an egg?
Hope you r fyn there
Mam waiting for your recipes
I made it and it turned out great!  My dough was very sticky and I needed more than 1/4 cup of additional bread flour at the end to be able to get it out of the mixer and onto the counter.  My loaf took about 1 hour to rise.  But the 30 minutes cooking time was spot on, and the bread is delicious.
@New子涵
Hi Jenny,;thank you so much to this recipe. I have just made one, it is a big success, it is sooo yuuummmm☺ I followed exactly your instruction, and the foil tent part works really well, it makes the bread looks evenly  brown and pretty. Thank you very much again.
When are you getting your own show on Food Network?  I love watching you!
I just made this bread and it taste amazing!!!!
Can this be made as a non whole wheat?
I try this bread and i love it thanks Jenny
Can I use "whole wheat flour" instead of the "all-purpose flour"? or what about maybe "Sprouted wheat flour"?
COULD YOU GIVE A RECIPE FOR FARMHOUSE WHITE BREAD ?  PLEASE  THANK YOU
You are so funny. God bless you
Mam super
I like ur cooking alot caz u every day things present in home and with simple ingredients you make out good things .thanks alot
Your a dag love you
WHY is this recipe so much better than the 3 or 4 others I've been using for years???!! It's just bread! But this one smelled better from the first 5 minutes in the oven, was super easy, and is by far the prettiest when baked. Great job, Jenny! I understand if you're overwhelmed by all the questions, but I hope you at least are finding time to read new comments, because new subscribers are still finding you in 2018! Thanks for the videos!
Nice, gonna give it a shot. Thank you.
Why do  you have to keep buying spatulas?   Wouldn't one be enough?   Is the plastic degrading, if so, into the bread that is eaten?
cAN you make white bread with this method? While I and my step kids love wheat bread, my husband doesn't. Thanking you in advance for your response.
She’s not kidding about spending her money on spatulas instead! Lol Did y’all see the collection in the background?
And you CANT make me. Feisty grandma
It looks good, please stop using aluminum foil it's not healthy .
Who's your day! Hahahaha. Thank you for the recepie 😍😘
You're my new favorite cooking channel 💜 !
Seems to be a lot of sugar and that can cause quicker browning due to the Maillard effect.
great will try this when i get my new kitchin thanks
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love u
Thanks for recipe. Please do  more recipes. Promise we will   not ask any questions ..
Me, 7-year-old and 4 year-old love your recipe! Always turns out sooo delicious
“Who’s your DADDY” omg love you Jenny you crack me up. Home recovering from surgery and I actually hurt myself laughing 🤣
lol lol oh mercy!  And she said it with a straight face!
jajaja. So funny the part that you broke the egg. Today I'm going to try this recipe... regrets since Guatemala
thanks !
I just want to find out if you could rise an almond flour using yeast (or flower from lentils).
This is the simplest recipie that I found about baking bread. Unfortunately, I am failing at it. I think it has to do with using the right measures  and how much yeast to use for how many cups of flour. My dough didn't rise. I followed the same method. Nonetheless, I ended up doing things a little differently and I wonder if that could have been the reason  1) I always have problems figuring out the cup size as "cup" measures (available in the market) have varying volume. So Jenny's 1 cup could be different from my 1 cup. Well, in this case it was indeed different. So I just found a bowl which roughly looked like Jenny's cup. I took 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of all purpose flour. 2) The other mistake (it may be not a mistake. You guys can tell me) was that I forgot to add the yeast in the dry mix. I realized that when I had added oil, egg and milk but had not started mixing it. Anyways, this should not be the reason. 3) I didn't use the mixer. My hand mixer gave up on me at the last minute. So I kneaded the flour manually. I spent a long time kneading it but it is possible that I did not knead it properly.   Please give me suggestion. I have always failed at baking bread. My dough does not rise. So looks like I need proper yeast suggestion
❤️❤️❤️
My first time trying to make bread and your recipe was perfect. My bread looked exactly like yours before and after cooking. It tasted great, hopefully as good as yours. Thanks again.
My dough is coming out too dry and hard before I start kneading it. It’s just falling apart. How do I remedy this?
im trying to do this now but it keeps coming out way too dry from my mixer.  what should i do to remedy?
Thank you for this wonderful bread recipe!  (I normally make all of my own whole wheat bread, but I will be using this recipe instead from now on.). This bread turns out very well, crusty on the outside and softer on the inside. It is tasty, fast and easy to make, and it is much less messy to make than other yeast bread recipes. I followed your directions exactly.  I've tried several of your other recipes also, with good results too!
2 cup whole wheat flour ,
Jenny, I have just baked and even ate a nice large slice of your Whole Wheat Bread...and OMG.  It is the BEST I have ever baked.  I went word for word and watched your video while baking it and it turned out perfect. I watched videos for two days trying to find the one that I thought would be "the one",  and not only was your instructions simple and easy, you were also so organized, and loved your humor. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I have a couple of questions. 1st..how do I get the dough ready for it to be baked another day? 2nd..what would the nutritional value be of your recipe? We have gone all natural in our cooking. I will be viewing everyone of your videos and know that I will be well pleased. Thanks again!
Jenny, I just tried your whole wheat bread recipe for dinner tonight. It was wonderful. I’ve never been able to make decent ww bread but with your technique, I finally succeeded!  Thank you so much. And your videos are great.
Love IT！Especially the ending part. LOL.
😂🤣🤣😂❣
This lady is so cute
Made another loaf and again, it turned out beautifully.  Last night, I made another, but ... changed it a little by making it a sourdough (I have a LOT of starter).  I substituted my starter for the envelope of dry commercial yeast.  Again Jenny , it turned out beautifully!!!  Thank you SO much for this video ... unlike others I've tried (by different people), yours works and we get a lovely loaf of bread!!!
I like the comedy
Thanks for sharing.
This is my kinda porn!  Emmm yum!
Looks so easy and great results! I’m glad to find your videos. You’re a kick too!
Hi can I use buttermilk instead of milk?
Turned put wonderfully and makes the best toast!!  Glad I don't have to use my dutch oven, as I did for the other bread ... for some reason, I end up with a round.,  nearly burned center bottom crust.  Checked out my oven and it's heating alright and watched my timing ... still that burned section.  Oh, Well ... this one turned out beautifully!!!!  Thank you, Jenny!!!
Who's your Daddy 🤣😂 You are hilarious 🤣😂 Love your work❤️  🇦🇺👍
I Just made it today, forgot to add the sugar but it came out tasty too. This recipe is perrrrfect! My husband love it!! :D
Jenny than you so much for your videos. I'm planing to make this loaf for my daughter tomorrow. May  I add some sunflower seeds?
This is the beeeest!!!!will be my go-to for wholemeal bread..Thanks  Jenny.
Just discovered your videos.  Love it!  I love all your colorful kitchen bowls and tools.  Thank you so much!  Beats the heck out of politics!
OH MY GOSH I LOVE YOU! i used to watch your talk show when i was in high school and you're still the same! beautiful and hilarious as ever and now this channel??? is there nothing you can't do? great video and i'm so gonna try this recipe!
Hola Jenny what a great recipe, I will try the cinnamon roll as well, easy, awesome and cheap. Thank you very much
I just made this bread and it is unbelievably delicious! Don’t know if I’ll ever buy bread again...made it entirely in Kitchen Aide mixer, a recent gift...thanks, Jenny!
it was an awesome presentation
WHO’S YOUR DADDY
Omg Jenny, those spatulas are amazing!! May I know where did you got them from?
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!! I just wish I can afford a kitchenaide mixer like yours. But will be making this for my hubby he loves whole wheat bread.
Is this Jenny Jones??!!! I miss your talk show! I use to watch it ALL the time 😀😀
Jenny thankyou so much for your recipe, i have tried many bread recipes and i just couldnt find one that provides an edible loaf......i have made your bread today and success at last its so good im making another as i type this. :-)
Eggs and milk, really?  Not good for you, wake up.
lovely lady
Thank you!
Who's your Daddy 😂😂😂
I lost it when you threw in the "who's your daddy" joke😂😂😂😂 Now every time I knead bread I'll remember this video😁
I can't believe she doesn't get flour on her clothing! Good for her! LOL!!
ايول 👌👌👌Very good
Can I use coconut flour instead of All purpuse flour?
Jenny has always been good in the kitchen. Full of humor making her tasty meals. Great recipe to follow and enjoy. Thanks Jenny.
Why the oil?
Your a naughty girl! Whose your daddy....spank spank. Then I love the egg warm up! Seriously great tutorial. ....thanks.
oh your so funny jenny thank you for bringing  some humour i am going to try your bread recipe
What else we can use instead of egg
What can I substitute for egg?
7:20 wtf!?
I dunno, women like watching me knead bread because it makes them think, what else can he do with his hands? Do some anger management and be firm with that dough. When I've been lazy and made no-knead bread it just isn't the same.
Who's your daddy!! Great recipe, thanks for sharing. I will leave out the Who's your daddy and spanking 😃 maybe. Egg warming 101, love it.
I need that timer where can I find it😂
for how many days will it last?
Excellent!  Just what I was looking for.
Jenny, this is my 1st visit &  I gotta say. You are just too cute.. (Spank it, who's your daddy, & where do I put this egg) too funny, BTW the bread looks yummy. And so do you, Great vid. I'll be bak
hi i dont have any idea which rack i need to place the dough? top, middle or bottom of the oven? help pls 🙂
Can't thank you enough for sharing this ...... came out awesome...
LOL who's your daddy
Nice presentation... I like cooking at the age of 70 and cooking nice vegetarian recipes.
your so funny!!
I made the bread it's the best!!
you an awesome lady! love your recipes!!
I love this video sooooooooooooooooooooooo much. its so soothing to wATCH
I made this bread this morning and it was my first time making bread. I used an electric mixer, only one beater used. I kneaded 100 turns and let it rise 45 minutes. Followed all other instructions. Came out perfect but wished I had sprayed bottom of my pan with cooking spray. Totally delicious and will make from now on! Thank you for this fabulous recipe!
This lady is wild 😂 Love the recipe btw, I tried it myself and it's fool proof!
You are a meme
I have a glass loaf pan, do I need to cook it longer if it's glass? Thank you.
SLAPS SLAPS SLAPS WHOS YOUR DADDY LMAOOO
That crack of the egg though 😂😂😂👍👍👍
THANKS FOR SHARING Jenny THANKS FOR MAKING IT EASY FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO CAN NOT COOK THANK YOU SO MUCH YUMMY DELICIOUS

"Your getting married" Forgets bout the egg and cracks it  "Oh crap" 😂😂😂😂😁😅😅😮
You are funny as hell. Can't wait to try the wheat bread. Lol
Why not cut into the loaf to show the density?. Please
Beautiful..! I just watched a TED lecture on Food Science & Health, telling that wholegrain bread is among the very best diet / food choice..  I can't wait to learn how to make my own whole grain bread..  thank you very much, Jenny.. :-)
Well done Jenny!
Hi  I am having gas oven. can i make it the bread in home. please share the step with us
You are hilarious. 😂 Hey Jenny love your channel, reminds me of my mom. Quick question, what was that blue timer in your kitchen ?  Sorry I am just curious.
Wow I really love your  videos,Thank you for the great post,Recipes are easy and you make it a joy you're such a comic!  I shared your post on facebook. I'm sure everyone will enjoy the easy recipe and Your sense of humor! Thank you!
You are a dark horse
حنا نسويها في الميفى احسن من حقتك.
Can I use honey instead of sugar??
Why do you need two different types of flour? Can I just use wheat flour ?
Jajajaja your funny.. jajaja
Jenny can cook and Jenny is funny! Oh, by the way, I'm a male, where do I keep the egg to warm? hehehe
I love your method.
Yummy bread
Wow mam your recipes are great dear
I'll tell you ONE thing:    Your bread might be better than mine, but my foil tent looks MUCH better than yours!  I have a folded/creased ridge with curled/turned sides and vent flaps on both ends!   Also, when I spanked my bread, my neighbor called S.C.A.N. on me!  (:=P)   ...LOVE the video!
lol who's your daddy, it looks yumm
Can we remove eggg from recipe ?
😂😂 who’s your daddy !!!
Oh my word! I love this recipe! It was so easy that I followed you all the way through (with the exception of editing) and my bread was AWESOME 👏!! My husband loved it and was very impressed that I made “fresh bread” (the only way he’ll eat it). This will totally save me money as well! Thank you Jenny, I was so proud of myself :-D
great  thanks
You are very good  I have one confusion that the bread is healthy or nhi please till me ??
I followed your instructions to the t and the doe was really sticky . Any one tell me what I did wrong
I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE..... SWEET SMELLING, SOFT AND PALATABLE BREAD..... YOU HAVE TO TRY IT.....
Who’s your daddy!!! You have interesting past!!
She is really good about sandwich bread no one can do like her keep doing the good Job Jenny
Wonder full  easy to follow
Never sugar in bread!
I thought the point of having this expensive mixer was to eliminate tedious hand kneading? Am I missing something?
Hey Jenny! Girl you sure can cook! Why are you retired?! 🤔🤔🤔🤔 It would be great if you had a syndicated version of this cooking show!
Hahaha
Hi I'm from Bombay made this recipe I pleaded with hand n dough was sticky but after adding white flour it turned out ok tks
You are my partner to make a bread  Thanks jen 😃
Omg u re funny and lovely mum
whose your daddy what anice and cute thing to say your show is so smart
Oh my God! lol! I love you!!!!! Great recipe btw!!!
I love your vids, You crack me up. Thank you.
I just watched your method of making bread in 90 minutes it's real simple and I appreciate this vid. I'm now making bread to thank you so much I really like the way you present yourself on your vids hard off to you miss jenny
Why add the sugar? A true bread would not contain sugar. And get rid of the mixing bowl, the way to make a real bread is using the ingredients and your hands to mix, thats how bread was first made
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hi Jenny! I tried your recipe. My bread is undercooked. Should I put it in the oven again for anoether 15mins? How should I know when to stop?
I haven't baked bread for years, now I want to after watching your demo. My husband doesn't like the store bought ones, as they are tasting sweet, he says. Can I reduce the sugar to half and make? Thank you for sharing your delicious recipes Jenny Jeya
nice
I have always wanted to learn how to bake bread thank you for sharing
Hi Jenny, Would like to try the recipe. However being a vegetarian cannot use egg as an ingredient. Could you suggest a substitute please. Or is it possible to  exclude the egg ?
Wonderful! 😂
Hello! I have a question,  can I use oatmeal flour instead of wheat flour??
Haha that was fun ....Love the bread and your sense of humor
She is so utterly adorable! :) :)
Can you substitute something else for the milk in this recipe?
I adore your timer!  That is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!  Thank you for the video.  I look forward to trying this.  :-)
ur so funny dear..spank it..whose ur daddy now
Could have had more whole wheat flour for your heart. It's recommended by the Mexican government.
Did you put molasses in it to get that color?
Wow, no proofing yeast separately, no mysterious kneading, no hour long rise time, no hot water in oven and super quick. Thank you so much Jenny! 🤗.  Actually, I added a little more flour while kneading cos I added some malt drink to mine 🙄. Worked perfect for me 1st time & my family think I'm a legend. 👍
"Who's your daddy?" You still crazy Jenny. Love you woman!
I JUST LOVE WATCHING YOU MAKING THIS DELICIOUS BREAD..I MAKE BREAD USING TODDY AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE FROM THE COCONUT TREE.. AS YEAST.. YAMMO..
I liked the end
Who your dad lol  Im your Hoosierdaddy
I made this bread today...
@ 7:26......hey hey hey hey hey.....
You are so funny.
Made this last nite. However, I didn't have any milk. So, I mixed cream cheese, mayo, and water. After creaming together the cc & mayo, I added water and mixed it to the same viscosity of milk. Heated the mix in microwave. It came out beautifully. I thought I would have to leave it for longer than 90 mins, but tooth pick was clean by 90mins- so I took it out. This is an easy-peezy recipe.
Very nice indeed. Thank you very much for sharing.
Tablespoons, teaspoons, whole wheat, white flour, oil, milk, egg... Argh..  So confusing. And what does kneading do?  Why can't you bake it without kneading. And why does it have to rise?
Hey BABE you are so funny, love your recipes too
Very good and  easy  delicious bread I wonder what's the best way to keep frech for several days
Can we use water instead of milk? Will there be any texture difference?
I'm gonna ask it who's yo mama!.!. Lol 😂 very helpful thank you! 🤘🏽
Why so much salt and sugar ???
I just found you today. Just hit subscribed right the way :-D
Jenny, you are SO fun to watch and you explain things so well.  You don't drone on and on like some video cooking chefs.  And your humor is just right!  I'm making this bread today!  Thank you :))
The high speed beating was mesmerizing
Lovely video
you are awesome and simple lady love from Pakistan
Omg hilarious! I love you!!
I love you.  Please marry me.
Thanks for the video, you’re funny)))
Can you make this with unbleached flour?
😂😂 she's so funny "whos your daddy" love your videos seen only 2 so far !
Tried making out wheat bread today. Wow ! Came out very well. Very detailed procedure . Thank you.
great recipe, thank you! I was just wondering if you can add honey?
Thank you very much for this, Jenny..:). Going to make this tomorrow...:))
I expected you will cut the bread into slices. You disappointed me lol
You’re so funny!
Can't wait to try this recipe...
you are awesome, I love your show, oh, by the way, I'm from the the Bahamas
Dear Jenny.......do not ever stop your videos......you are very entertaining,your recipes are great and your videos are very well made.thank you
Hello from India...and please have the same humour really very nice
wow
A packet is 2 1/4 tsp; not that it would make a huge difference. :)
Saw you about 6 weeks ago and baked your pan loaf and I haven’t eaten any other bread since. Thank you for the videos and helpful hints and advise. Am baking another loaf as I write this. 😁😁
I really loved your  video. I loved to  eat  bread.
Naughty cook, "who's your daddy" here "I can warm that in my cleavage". Love your classes..
What is the serving size and calories count?
jenny estas loca
Thank you for the recipe!! It is worth doing this home because sometimes they put alot of  unnecessary ingredients to keep it. Fresh longer  and also improve the taste!!  Some of the ingredients they put in  are horrible for human consumption!!!  Especially cheap bread!! Organic breads might be better of course to next best thing to home  made breads !!
This is an excellent recipe and bread turned oht great and very easy to make. Thanks! How can we make this using toaster oven?
Great video, Jenny...and you made me chuckle! 😂 Can I use all whole wheat flour...without adding any white flour? Or will it come out too heavy and dense? How can I use 100% whole wheat flour but still have a bread that’s light and fluffy?
Why you want to retire?
Why do you pound on the dough? I was taught never to do that because it will damage the yeast. There is no reason to pound on the dough.
Hahahaha .. you are awsome xD
I love you videos or nice I plan to make your bread and I love your humor!!!
Good
OMG you're hilarious!!!!
M from Malaysia.
I like jenny can cook recipes. Tq.gbu

Great video
Hahaha,  you make my day lady hahaha LOL.
Didn't you used to be on tv ? Sorry I am from Liverpool England , am a bit vague from time to time
Made my first loaf of this yesterday, and it won't be my last!
Does anyone know how to store home made bread and the shelf life, so I know how much to make and save??😯
OMG! Just realized who Jenny is,,, I use to love watching The Jenny Jones Show in my teens... 😆😍
Like it.. 👍
Like it.. 👍

Is the egg necessary?
We do it differently on the African continent especially in Namibia and South Africa but thank you for sharing.
wow
I like that egg warming ...did you really break it? 😂
So funny!  Love you and your recipes!
Jenny hasnt posted anything for years.   I really enjoy her recipes...wonder what has happened to her...
You're the best, Jenny.  The Mrs Maizel of Baking!
Ms. Jenny, I like your humor and easy instructions... Thank you. My mom taught me how to bake bread at an early age but you taught me how to in another easier way...
OMG I KNEW I KNEW THE VOICE JENNY JONES.
Hi! Can I substitute the egg and the milk with oil and soy milk?

I tried all your recipes and they are perfect, honestly. Some of the recipes are not good enough even if I followed it step by steps. Keep doing the good work!
You are a hot mess!! But I learn so much & you make it light & easy....
Trying to make this without the eggs and sugar and keep failing all the time......grrrr
you're so funny and you don't to try and sound like a professional. so fun to watch.
Jenny I'm really enjoying learning to make my own healthy bread, thanks for your fun smart instruction videos 🍞✔💕🤗
LOL!! Why did I know you were going to warm the egg in your cleavage?? :)) Very funny and fun video! GREAT recipe!! Thank you! You made my day.
You should have your own show!
I always  make my breads in my bread machine  , and it does everything from kneeding and baking !!  I recommend it to everyone who want to save time in the kitchen!!
how do I make this whole grain. trying to make some for my 17 month old.  my husband like a bale and eat brand that Kroger has and he was giving it to our daughter, but I found that it has soy in it and I don't want her to have that. I try to make most of her food, so this would be good. Can I use a breadmaker and I do not have a stand mixer
Yesterday i made this Oh my God! It was fabulous. Thanks a lot 4 this recipe☺
Can you use it as a pizza dough too?
Wooow!
I really like the way you explained  and it made me to try this.. thank you
Can I use the bread machine instead?
You are such a sweetheart.  Love your recepie. You are the one who inspired me to make my own bread and not buy anymore . Thank you
And then the smashed boob egg! I love this channel! 🤣🤣🤣
“Gotta spank that dough! WHO’S YER DADDY?!” 🤣  OMG I laughed out loud! Best cooking videos EV. VERRR. 🤪😆   Love you, Jenny! ❤️❤️❤️  Because of you I started baking bread everyday again! Thank you for being hilarious and awesome!!
You’re fantastic lol
I enjoy watching your videos THANKS. This was so funny at the end. I was wondering if you where on TV. I feel like I've seen you somewhere else? So happy to see instant rapid rise yeast as I bought some.  I am going all out on my bread rolls and donuts making venture.
I love your sense of humor😍😁 thanks for this recipe. I tried it & it came out delicious🙏🏽
I watch your videos all of the time....had this nagging feeling that I had seen you before.  I googled you and realized you had a talk show years ago, and then you were just gone.  I loved you then, and love watching you now!!!
my loaf seemed not to rise as much durring baking time...still delicious but what my i have done wrong? i used primarily organic ingredients and the regular yeast not rapid
Lol😂😂😂I'm so happy I found you!!! Thankyou for the recipe, steps are super easy to follow. And I loooooveee the colors🌈blessu
thank you Jenny, it was my first time to make this loaf bread, and you make it really easy with the very helpful details, thank you

I checked through a big chunk of the FAQ on your website and I didn't see an answer. I want to use honey instead of sugar in this recipe. I made it tonight and it is delicious BTW. How much honey and when do I add it?
Love your recipes. Is the oven heating with gas or electric? How much would be the baking time change?

Thank you much
Hi, Would you please make an almond flour or alternative flour bread recipe
Omg I just discovered this channel!  You are so sweet and loveable! You also gave great realistic advice! Thank you so much, I'm gonna try this recipe right now!
Azar6305@gmail.com
Hi, this is one of the best breads I've ever made. This is now my Go-To method. super easy and such a great result. Thanks for posting this video...
waiting you to slice up the bread but you didn't. now i've to search another video on 'cutting the bread' just to satisfy me
So you left the dough out of the oven 5:11?
Spank the dough, who's the daddy..........right, lol
Followed your recipe for weight and did not work,  did it first on video and used the cup measure, turned out very nice Then I did the weight measure as i like to follow a written recipe, the whole thing fell apart to much liquid for the amount of flour.  I have two cup sizes and then weighed flour both were different to yours a lot more than. 240 grams which  is what you have on your written recipe. Your cup looks quite large on your video. Could you please tell me how much your cup holds.  It is a lovely recipe so easy but need to get the weight of ingredients right.  Thank you for your time.
Hahahahaha! Hit the subscribe button on the "Who's your Daddy" comment hahahaha
We love you too... I watched from Germany
Who’s your daddy?
I really love her
Who's your daddy...lmao, I love it! Subscribed!
Includ Brasilian like me
Could you please tell me the substitute for eggs and will it be as soft as the one with eggs  Thank you
I am afraid I did not see it
Hey  Greetings  Can we make the dough with out eggs please!!!!??
I followed the same steps,but I faced the problem in second raising,can anyone help were I went wrng?
I found you several months ago on YouTube and really have enjoyed watching these videos today I made this bread and it came out perfect! I wish I could fully express to you my joy at accomplishing this task but it’s impossible. In July 2014 I had a major stroke and became completely immobile. Before my stroke I had a very full and busy life. My goal was to do a video blog exactly like this because I loved baking cooking so much but that obviously came to an end and these last four years have been a horrible journey for me and never did I think I would be able to be in the kitchen with any equipment let alone bake a loaf of bread and have it come out perfectly you have been such a blessing to me Jenny  I want you to know it!
Who’s your daddy?...
I choked on my tea after the who's your daddy joke 😂😂😂😂
Hey Jenny, instead of egg what can I use
Pourquoi ne pas l'avoir coupé pour voir au moins la mie
I CAN MAKE MY OWN BREAD NOW !!! 😃😘😍😘
👍❤️👌❤️
Jeanye we vegetarian if we do not add egg
Thank you for this good recipe.It works well for me.
No da lista ingredientes y otras opciones esa levadura no de consigue
Lolll Who's your daddy.
Good ^_^
I love your beautiful colors, how nice!
sprrrrrrr
can I substitute milk by almond, soy, or cashew milk? or other?
the ending is to funny
Best recipe ever!! Making it third time in 10 days!! 😁
This is so simple.
What happens if you don’t let the egg warm up first?
so this is where that vine came from LMAO
Yummy
Do u need all purpose flour?
no wonder the Americans are fat. They put sugar even in the bread
"Whose your daddy?!" Hilarious!!! This looks like a very simple but healthy recipe. Thank you for taking the time to post this video. I am a good cook but can't bake to save my life. This is good for a novice like myself. Thanks again
Awesome Video!!  And the way you ended it was hilarious 😅😅😅😅 Keep up the great work 😘😘💕 Best wishes
So simple. Great teacher!
I've just made this bread in my bread machine and it's absolutely THE BEST LOAF I'VE EVER MADE, and I've been making my own bread for decades.  The size, texture, colour, and flavour are wonderful!  It also toasts beautifully.  Thank you, Jenny; I won't be using my old recipe again.
comedy
LOL.. whose your daddy? Put the egg onto the cleavege.. woohoo!! Very good video.. ty
Allowing the dough to proof a longer time will take the kneading out of it.  Using warm milk speeds up the process.  About four hours proofing will have it almost ready.  Put it in a skillet to shape and proof for another hour, slide it into the loaf pan and into the stove with zero kneading.   Remember that yeast is alive, boiling or near boiling water or milk will kill it. 120 f is perfect.  If you need the bread in an hour and a half, kneading will be involved. The fun part for some folks.  We don't buy bread anymore either and it is a significant savings, especially for the fancy stuff like olive bread.
How would this work with white whole wheat flour?
Hey Jenny I am from India..  the who's your daddy is the start for me subscribing... cooking is great...
Hi Jenny , I just found your site today !! You are adorable !!! Loved your jokes and your kitchen is so colourful I love it !!! Im very much into colours some of my favourite appliances are pink hahaha ! Thank you for this recipe !!!!  Making it today :)
Jenny cd i just use only all purpose flour to make this
I've made this bread and it turns out great every time. It is also easy to double or even triple depending on your needs. Thanks Jenny. I'll try the cinnamon one next.
It was looking good till the aluminum foil part. I never use or have any of it. Aluminum causes Alzheimer's and other diseases. Many don't know that. But anyway, thought I would mention it. Peace.
guess I send message here then your Jenny can cook page I subscribed to and see there are still new messages on it from december 2017  so guess it is stil working  but  I can not put any message on it or reply  I only get errors  so  want to say this bread is really good I never been a star in baking mostly it end up like  very tough bread  that  taste not to bad but to dry or hard  to eat   and with this recipe I made some soft  and real tasty bread  hope you stil read this message  and maybe can help me fix the problem I have on your Jenny can cook page  and make it work for me to thanks  and stil hope the page stay up for some time  so I can learn more from it  in the baking it is fun if things work  out  and taste good
I am from India. So nice... I liked the way you did it - cooking with humour !..  Great going Jenny
ഓവൺ ഇല്ല്യതെ ഉണ്ടാക്കാൻ പറ്റുമോ
I very  like it thank you so much
Thank you thank you thank you. A recipe that actually works to perfection. Brilliant. Absolutely delicious . I used fresh yeast though xx
The "who's your daddy" and the egg at the end had me laughing! This woman is crazy and I love it. 😂
nice
Very easy recipe, but it took longer than you noted to rise 1 inch over the pan....very Great tasting Bread👍🏽your very funny.
whos your daddy lol.   nice vid jenny
What about using a dough hook?
She had me at.. “spank that dough. Whose your daddy”.. 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂  👇🏻Subscribe!
i saw your video an decided to make bread... so simple!! and you are funny ;)
Can I follow the recipe without the egg??? If not, can you suggest a vegan version??
can i make white flour?
Jenny,Thank you so much for that wonderful bread recipe.  I made it today, but I used White bread flour.  This was the best loaf of bread I have ever made.  It taste good, there were no holes in the slices and it sliced perfectly.  The only thing I am wondering is how to store it.  I don't want to put it in the refrigerator because when I have done that in the past it tends to make the bread hard and dry.  So I put it in a bread bag and wrapped it in a kitchen towel - I hope that is alright.Again, thank you so much for that great bread recipe.
you tell it what to do ... easy way... and are funny.. thank you
Hahahahahaha u are what I needed to learn how to cook omg I'm obsessed love uu 😂😂😂😂
Omg! Jenny Jones has her own you tube channel?? This is awesome!
I love your colorful Kitchen
Thank you for this recipe i love it. It works for me too lucky and 😋😋😋
You are sooo cute Jenny you’d rather spend your money on spatulas hhhaahhhathat was a good one . I love your sense of humor you funny 😄
Nice recipe BUT I find the inside a bit dry. Anyone know why ?
Ha..ha..ha..ha..!!  O.. You are just..Great...! Loved your simple, perfectly effective style. Keep making us learn new things. :)
Who’s yer daddy. You’re the best Jenny!
Bread was good but was hoping more for a crunchy crust. This had the consistency of a soft crust. Any advice on how to achieve that or do I need another recipe?
Can I use  this recipe for baking bread in bread maker?
Hi Jenny,  I have a few questions. 1.  For some reason, my flour gets way too dry with the recommended amount of milk and flour.  Should I add more milk or water as I see fit?  From what I understand, the flour does not rise well if it is too dry.   2.   Also, what model of the mixer are you using?  My mixer does not do the same thing as yours...  It looks almost the same, but it just throws the chunk of flour around without even mixing it.  A lot of dry flour on the side of the bowl, with one big chunk in the middle...     3.  What material is the cover you use for the flour when they rise?  I used the plastic sheets, and they stick to the flour and made a mess when I tried to pull it off.     Thank you for showing this video.  You are probably too busy to answer this.
I made this and wowww....Thankyou so much.
Marlon Webb made a vine out of the "Spank that dough" part
I just finished baking my first loaf of this wonderful bread!! It comes out really wonderful, this is great recipe!! Thank you so much ❤️
..woo ow. .Jenny nice bread.thanks
LMAO! came to the best video for making homemade wheat bread! "Who's your daddy?" lmao!
My first attempt at baking whole wheat bread was a success, thanks to Jenny Jones!  Her written directions and YouTube video were clear and concise.  Thanks, Jenny, for sharing this part of your life with us!
Omg this is hilarious
Its me again,   I just want ti say that I love your kitchen,   I love the  variety colors of your spatulas.   I will cipy your style in the kitchen.
Jenny, I love your videis.   Thank you so nuch fir sharing us tour knowledgs in coiking different kinds of foods.    You have a good  sense of humor,   esocially when you say.  "  WHOSE YOUR DADDY "
Hi , I just baked this bread and it came out wonderful. loved your eggless chocolate cake with simple frosting too.....
Dear Jenny, Thanks to you. My 1st wholemeal bread success 😎 From Malaysia, Janice
You Makes this eggy so happy
%otg use tips
I had no idea what I was watching because you are hysterical.  I had to play it again
I like how you give possible substitute options like using instant yeast or which flour will work.. Observed in other recipes too.. :)
That is wholesome!
7:35 I'm dead 💀
i make it and waiting for to rise  i love you jenny you're so sweet and funny and your recipes so good hope you the best
I made the bread today and its awesome. Thank you for the recipe!
Ok, the egg thing was hilarious. As a baking enthusiast though, I have to take issue with 2 points. To be accurate this is a Transitional Whole Wheat bread. They are more to popular liking than true whole grain breads. Second, bread tastes so much better when it has been allowed to rise properly. I know the time factor seems daunting to some people, but using extra yeast to speed it up affects the flavor. It can leave it tasting a bit metallic. With half the yeast and twice the time, this is an excellent recipe.
Really useful video! Thanks for recipe:)
I love bread.  And in making that bread, that's so funny; I'll have to remember the egg thing!!
Love your videos and recipes Jenny. Pity my loaves don't always turn out the same (hardly ever) but hey - I have fun trying :-)
Good very good
If the bread don't have egg I love to eat , I am vegan and raw vegan
Love this... Thank you Jenny,  practise is making perfect with my bread, the tips are very helpful :)
WHO'S YO DADDY! lol. You're one of a kind. I love your cooking videos. Hope you find time to make more Enjoy retirement - you deserve it.
I  just made it last night and it worked beautifully, great recipe!  But I don't know why I can smell the yeast from the bread?
You're cute ,,, and funny, I like you and your recipe Jenny. I'm going to try your bread.
you are awesome!😂
You are so funny!
I love this! Thank  you !
Thank you for replying. My pan is 41/2  x 8 1/2. The bread is delicious so really not a big deal. Thanks again.
Hi, I liked how easy is this recipe. What I noticed is the bread did not rise the way yours look on the video.  I used e-b egg instead of regular and used the Active Dry yeast. Do you think that has anything to do?  I love your videos!!! thank you for sharing.
Does this loaf require refrigeration ? Just concerned due to egg and milk perishables in recipe.
Oh my gosh! I love this lady😂first the spanking then the egg
555... Love your sense of humor, Jenny!! I used to follow your talk show many years ago, and I subscribed your channel. Love your recipes too. (FYI : 555 is sound of 'Hahaha' in my language)
Hi Jenny I just watched the video  and I liked the way you showed how to make this bread . I have a question . i just all purpose flour ( I don't have bread flour or whole wheat flour . I live in Venezuela so getting these last flours is really expensive . Can i just use all purpose flour ?
I made this! What a great recipe. I mixed by hand. Added a handful of sunflower seeds and some rolled oats while kneading. Placed round mound  on a cookie sheet covered with corn meal. After it had risen I slashed the top of it diagonally with knife about 10 times. After baking about 15 minutes I brushed it with egg wash. Came out looking like fancy artisan bread.  The best bread I have ever made. Two days it is gone! Thanks Jenny
'You've got to spank that dough. Who's your daddy?' :D
Must I add the egg?
haha Jenny you're so cute!
I made this exactly as the recipe say it came out hard like a brick worst receipe ever
i oddly counted when you started kneading lol you were like 2-5 kneads ahead of what you counted
This video makes making bread so simple for beginner cooks! 💓💓💓
Who's your daddy?? Haha subscribed😂
3:03 😂😂 I love it!!
Porque todo es en inglés podrían poner sustituidos por favor
Lol who's your daddy.. Awesome recipe
Said don’t grease the pan and i didn’t and my bread is stuck☹️
I loved this video, no over explaining, just to the point. I've made white bread and avoided whole wheat bread making. Now I can buy some whole wheat flour and give it a try. Thank you.
Jenny , why dont you make videos in this year????
Hi Jenny how are you?! Miss your videos and hope you upload more awesome and healthy recipes/videos :)
🌹👍
I absolutely love you and I just found you! ❤️😂
As a Eruopean who lives of long fermented, long with only 3 ingridients: Rye kernels, salt, water (+sourdough) it is quite fascinating the amercian way of baking is the complete oppisite: Fast, fast , fast. Modern, new equipement and recipe, methods and thousands of ingridients, yet in homemade thing.
I love your recipe, I'm on my third loaf, I don't buy bread anymore :)
"Its easier if you have cleavage" "You are getting married *egg breaks*, crap" 😂😂😂. OMG!! Jenny u r so funny. Awesome video btw😙
Wish there was an edit function to correct the obvious typos in my previous. James
Jenny I love your videos and am suprised that you are suprised. I have watched this one because I am chaseing for a recipe. I have an ancient Kenwood Chef (I am English) and my dough hook works OK) and the acompianing cooklet had the recipe I am looking for. Without a good woman to bake my bread for me and you are obviously not available I would like to bake two loafs at the same time and the recipe I am looking for does. I am an X-Enginner and I prefer mass in Kilogram/grams so your cups in particular are a proble to me. I am no good at eye-balling. You have to be a competent cook type person for that to work. Not sure where I am wandering to now so - bye - amd keep giving us these videos please.  James
Yer so silly! I just love you!
I love it thanks for sharing
Hi jenny   I realy love this recipe  I made it before , easy to make and tasty the kids love it too Thank you .

I use to watch your talk shows. I loved watching you change fashions with the seasons. I didn't know you had a channel until now. You can answer all the questions, so hire a personal asst. cuzz, not answering them will make peeps not think you care. I have lupus and sit at home with nothing to do. Hire me!
You are amazing! :)
Enjoyed it!
I like how you warm your eggs. I like eggs :)
Wonderfully explained and thanks for sharing.
Delicious . . .
can i ask the instant yeast or dry yeast are same????
Hello Miss Jenny,  I'm from the Philippines, I tried some recipe here on Youtube the best recipe I got is yours, I find it more easier.  Thanks a lot, I'm not buying wheat loaf bread in the store anymore.  My husband love it too.  I'm selling it to my neighbors and friends. More power!
Looks great! Do you use added wheat gluten to any of your wheat bread recipes? I was told it helps with the rise and texture. Thanks
OMGGG this was hilarious and informative all in one! Thank you Jenny
You are so funny .  Great video !
Jenny, you make me smile x
Omg the last part was hilarious :)
lovely.
I made this a while ago in it was a success, it was soft and delicious. My family loved it
Is all purpose flour good if you don't have the other kinds of flour?
Who´s your daddy ?? hahahahahah
She's funny....
I just got fired from my job at the bakery, which is upsetting because I really Kneaded the dough.
Very informative... ... and funny. 😂
I love the ending haha! I died.
i will tray this way & told you about it as i can >>>> thanks from Egypt  >>>>> .
Wish I was that egg. LOL
All purpose flour in. Whole wheat bread recipe! However , it's a Good video
love it.
We miss you. Sorry you were overwhelmed. Peace and blessings for you.
She is still fine as I dont know what..She never ages..What an awesome woman!!
I think her clothes match her oven o.O
So good Jenny
Did she really just spank the dough and say who's your daddy? ' - '
WHOSE UR DADDY?????
I love your video! Thanks😆
You make me laugh Jenny thank you & i love your recipes 😊
I made it and it was AMAZING. Thanks sugar!!
Give it a little spank, "Who's your daddy!"😂
I love the egg heating parts... you're funny ...LOL
Que mejor que la alegría para enseñar ....
Thanks Jenny...😎👌👌👌🍻
its lovely
I just made your wheat bread recipe today. The best I've ever had! Not sweet but a nice crust and crumb. So easy. I've never made bread from scratch before. Love, love!  I'm going to try your crusty Dutch oven white loaf next. I wish I could post the pictures for you. I bought cast iron loaf pans and the browning is perfect.
Your funny
This is the best Recipe bread I've ever made. The  aroma was so strong and it was crispy  on the outside and soft in the inside. I used my bread machine to do the kneading and after 20 minutes, I let it rest for 10 minutes for first rise.  This recipe is so simple , yet I left out two tablespoon of olive oil. I took the risk and add on during the kneading process. The dough  became wet  and  I just shut the cover. Amazingly, it turned out So so so Good! Thank You For Sharing This Wonderful Recipe with Everyone!
hi jenny my name is tricia and I'm from Trinidad I recently started watching your videos and I instantly subcribed I love watching you. your so hilarious. .by the way I'm baking bread right now. ..lol . thanks so much for your recipes

can you make rainbow bread with this recipe?
THX i learn a lot
Oh My Goodness !!!!! You "Cracked" me up & I had Ar least One Good Giggle for this Day!!! Can't wait to try your Eady Recipe for the WWB!!! Big Hug's!!
At 01:55, MORE flour that is NOT whole wheat. I'm not interested in this video now.
"...RapidRise instant yeast, but the regular active yeast is the same." NOT true. They are cultivated differently. RapidRise works faster. I know, because I've tried both many times. Yes, the bread that comes out of the oven is the same, but the time to wait for the rise is different... UNLESS some conditions (room temperature, etc.) was different. If the room was cooler the day you used the RapidRise, it will not rise as rapidly.
TECNICALLY when you add flour that is NOT whole wheat flour, you are making what the bakeries and supermarkets in the U.S. call "Wheat Bread", NOT "WHOLE wheat bread". It may be 90% whole wheat, but it isn't whole wheat. This is different from our calling Obama "African American", when he was only half.
😀😀😀😀😀😀👏👏👏👏👏👏
Too funny! I love it...lol
Can you make lots this and then freeze the extras?
😂😂
I would never be able to do this recipe like jenny. my shirt would have flour all over the front of it.
u r very sweet
Wow, Jenny, this is absolutely the best whole wheat bread loaf I've ever made/eaten!!! Easy and delicious! I added some wheat germ too. Thank you for sharing your joy of baking :-)
My bread don't turn out the same
Jenny apart your fabulous recipes, you're simply so wonderfully entertaining. I'm trying out this bread recipe this evening; I made a great batch of pita's and artisans loafs on my day of at the weekend but that was me in the kitchen at 8am! I don't have 4hrs for hanging around tonight!!! Thank you 😊
Now that's carb porn.
You look great!  Thank you for sharing
I'm vegan. I'll try almond milk but not sure what might replace the egg ?
Love from South Africa...beautiful recipe, came out De-li-cious😉...You are one amazing woman
Well J J,  more viewers coming.  This is 7/30/17.  I just made the bread.   It turned out fantastic.   Soft and moist.  Thank you.   I hand made it no mixer.  Alas, didn't warm the egg in my bosom like you suggested.  Hahaha @
My wheat bread wont rise. Is it beacuse the milk is to hot? Can u help me.
Hahaha!
love your videos, and your sense of humor, great job...
Gosh...  She Is Incredible,  Wasn't Expecting That End Time Crack !
I put the Baguette on a Air Fryer for 10 min.
😂😂😂!!!
I love this hahhaah perfect recipe and funny.  Nice Work
Thank yuo dear yuo are perfect 😍😍😍
Would it be oki if I don't add all purpose flour but only wheat flour
Hahahahahahaha u are great love u
lol...."who's your daddy" :D
Is adding oil to the mix necessary or optional?
LOL I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING 😂😂😂😂 totally unexpected, loved the video ❤
Made this today and it turned out great!
love yr colorful spatulas
This is such a great video! Love the humor too!
I laughed my heart out when you cracked the egg like that....funny! I am sure going to try the bread, simple and easy to learn!
are you from Upper Silesia  (oberschessler)(z Górnego Śląska) because your receipts exactly from Upper Silesia?
easy recipe but my bread do not grow like yours
So funny!
hahaha, wow, so nice. simple and presented well in interesting manner.
I am a recently diagnosed diabetic patient. Hard to find wheat bread in my city and I decided to learn to bake them because they are good for me and choice of food is small. Would this recipe work for dietetic people?
Have you ever tried this recipe wheat free ?
Just made this for the first time the other night.  Best homemade bread I've ever made!  Thank you for this recipe so much!
Great video.
You make it look so easy! I was afraid to attempt making bread but not anymore :D love your recipes!
Liked the egg at the end !
This is a funny video, but I just have to say that sugar, oil, eggs or milk shouldnt be in a bread dough. Also adding flour after your initial run with your mixer is not advisable as the gluten wont get stretched. And a double rise will develop a tastier bread. Other then that, thumbs up.
Is fat free lactose free milk ok?
Jenny where did you buy your spatulas? They are beautiful!
oh Jenny I luv u for you are such a beautiful human being
You are fanny
You're so sweet; I like your videos
You're awesome  Great video :)
Nice lady - good diction, but what she baked is not bread, but a bun. Bread is made from flour, water, yeast and salt, nothing else.
Hi Jenny,  this is an awesome recipe, ur so rite I don't buy bread anymore myself, it's delicious what u have taught me... Thank-you and keep going, we need more of all the good stuff u make.

I found the meme.....            who's ur daddy
you are so freakin sexy
is it possible to make it without egg?
I usually don't subscribe to cookery video I just watch and move on but yours is different, straightforward and witty. I really enjoyed it.
Hey can i substitute the 240g of whole wheat flour with bread flour to make white bread?
i suggest less flour and more water
oh, Jenny, such a great pleasure watching you... so informative yet enternaining. luv u... keep shooting dear... :-)
MORE VIDEOS? I appreciate that so many people have asked for more videos but I have no immediate plans to make more, for several reasons. • I’m supposed to be retired! • I don’t have a staff - It’s just me. • It was just a hobby and I wasn’t prepared for this many views. • I can’t answer all the questions and then I feel bad for not helping. • Now I feel bad for not making more!   Thank you for all the love and appreciation. I will try to find time to make more but it won’t be for a while. Many questions are answered in my website FAQs and I continue to post new recipes there. www.JennyCanCook.com - always free/no ads. Love you guys!

I baked my first ever bread today using this recipe. It turned out great and thank you so much for this recipe. I used plain flour. The only issue was it had a slightly sweet and yeast taste. Can you think why is that?
it literally made me jump when you crushed the egg in your shirt! lol, i had my headphones on and was startled!
.
she put it NOO
I tried it and it worked brilliantly!! Thanks for the recipe!
Jenny I miss your daytime show!!   I absolutely love this recipe!

Thank you so very much Jenny for sharing the recipe. I tried it this morning n for the first time after many failed attempts, my wholemeal bread turned out perfect. So soft n fluffy. I'm so happy n thrilled. Unbelievable. Hug hug n kiss kiss.
OmG you are an absolute delight!! Thank you for being you :) you made my day!
I just love you, Jenny!
I just fell on the kitchen floor when she started spanking that dough "who's your daddy"
mine didn't rise as big as your dough, maybe I used the normal yeast?
I'm new to baking, can I use brown sugar?
lucky egg
😂😂
Wow this's a fantastic recipe and way to go from now on for "whole wheat bread "  For me I did make ones follow your method, I wish I can show you a picture 😁and the result was pretty and perfect. Thank you so much 😊

this is a bread that I'm definitely going to try because I just never seemed to understand why the dough need to rise do many times  & punch down & all that crap!
I accidently came across your video and you are going to make me this bread, for the first time. I cook so many things but have never baked bread.

Love your recipes, where have you been lately?

baaaahaaaahaaaa who's your daddy!!!
Bonjour Jenny! Ma mère maintenant âgée de 92 ans est d'origine polonaise. Je retrouve avec bonheur dans vos présentations beaucoup de choses qu'elle cuisinait quand j'étais enfant. Pierogi, crêpes aux pommes de terre et autres plats de son pays natal. Je ne connais pas bien la langue anglaise, mais suffisamment pour comprendre l'essentiel en vous regardant faire. Quel dommage que vos vidéos ne soient pas sous titrées en français.....! Vous êtes charmante et vous présentez vos recettes avec un joli sourire.
i just fell in love with this woman!! she is too much fun!! subscribing now!
love it got me laugh thanks , the bread look great.
super
lol the end was hilarious.  will try this recipe
I followed measurement as mentioned in the video.  but my dough was tight.  2 cups of whole wheat flour plus half a cup of all purpose flour with 1 cup of warm liquid.   I was sad that it did not rise as desired.
Can I omit the egg?
you are very cool and funny
Hi can i use Almond Milk?
milk and egg in bread!
👌💗😂https://youtu.be/-ACdfrnPGnM
You can sit on the egg and hatch it. ;-)
Love ya
Cracked the egg part. Hit subscribe. She's awesome!
beautiful and humble I like it.
I love all of her recipes! They are always sooo simple and such easy straight forward instructions! I love the fact that she uses everyday normal ingredients that people usually keep in their kitchens all the time. If you've not tried her lemon brownies/bars please do...they are so delicious and easy!
i knew i would subscribe when she slapped the dough and said "whos your daddy". love her!!!
Can't wait to try it! I wonder what I could replace the egg with....
love your video, I am going try this recipe Thanks!
I love your videos! You crack me up! Great recipes too :)
I made it and it's great!
i love your sense of humor, it makes learning more enjoyable. I LOL to this one, like really out loud...
She is way better than Martha Stewart
+Jennycancook why do you put an egg
love you Jenny! Not only do i learn how to bake but you make the ending hilarious
I don't know where I've been this whole time! I've just seen your video, and I gotta admit, You're amazing!!!
nice bread recipe,  my bread failed to rise so I put it in the oven anyway.  haven't seen you in years! nice to see you again. ...
When you put sugar into bread I stop watching.  There should never be sugar in bread baking. It's like giving driver a cup of alcohol before driving. It goes faster but will never be better. Avoid sugar in bread baking.
who's your daddy ...hahahahah omg !
my god Jenny, you.ve aged absolutely stunningly..what a sweetheart you are !. love your channel..keep up the great work ! Cheers !!

Jenny can you please tell me how much milk you used(measure in ml) and also what is the shelf life of this bread in general? +Jenny can cook
KEEP MOVING GRIL, YOUR GOOD !!!!!!!!
I love your videos!
whose your Daddy! hahahahaha So glad I stumbled across your channel. I remember watching you on our talk show:):)
LMAO, I didn't except the joke in the end. LOL. Sub'd
6:35, can you broil, instead of bake(one is heat from top and the other is heat from bottom; can we use the heat from bottom?)
Making bread had never been sooo easy, did this today and was perfect. Used my hands I don't have mixer.
This video made me smile :) Bless you ma'am.     P.S: Lovely bread btw.
Thanks!
As a young guy I am TOTALLY attracted to this woman.
HA! Love that timer.
You crack me up..you always have. You are just fun! I don't have cleavage either. 😂😂😂
Thank you!!! Great recipe! I have a question: can I use water instead of milk, same results?
lol I was not expecting her to be a comedian... good show!
Love you!
Thought Chef John's old guy jokes funny enough for cooking videos, but then I found Jenny! She has me chuckling out loud for a few videos in a row. I am a fan already...
hello   would a dough hook be ok to use?   and also can i make this vegan with an egg replacer and coconut milk?
Hi Jenny! Can i substitute the wheat flour for just breas flour and make a white bread loaf? Thanks! Love your videos!! 😘
<3
this lady is on fire lololol
This is really a good recipe! ..Like your humor as your putting all togather!  Love your 90 minute recipe!
You are amazing.  Thank you for making these videos.
I just finished my first of many, many loaves of this bread. I was skeptical of how it would turn out with only one rise. It was wonderful! Orders of magnitude better than any commercial sandwich bread. Thanks, Ms Jenny!
she is cool, love her
I just find your videos, first time I see these and I cannot stop!! you are such a sweet good looking lady and your sense of humour is just so theatrical. Love it Love it! Besides you are teaching how to make different kinds of bread easily. I will keep watching and Now I follow your chanel. So good to see the recipes fast but coomprehensible and no music. I love all about your videos! So thanks!
Haha i love you Jenny!!
Muchas gracias Jenny, me quedó fantastico!
I tried this today! Turn out really good! Thank u for a easy one!!
Omg ur so funny! I'll try ur recepie when I get the chance
Jenny, I just don't know how you do it, it's amazing.  I followed your recipe precisely and I couldn't get the dough to rise very much.  I had to resort to mixing the milk and sugar then adding the yeast and letting it foam up for five minutes.  And then adding the rest.  As a novice bread baker, I'm stumped how you can get the yeast to do its job when you add it to all of the other dry ingredients, including the salt.  I'm presuming that the answer is in your greater experience than mine but how you can make it work is perplexing.
You are funny. Thank you for the tips. God bless!
i just love you...you always make me smile
I wish I had the mixer so I could make that
Looks like peanut butter when it came out of the mixer
omg its jenny jones hahahah, freakin awesome!!!!
Can I use white flour instead of wheat, in this recipe?
Who's yer daddy, lol I love it! Great videos too.
how can you call this a whole wheat bread when there is all purpose flour included?
Thank you for the recipe. It's really soft and perfect!
This is the best whole wheat bread ever !!!!!!!
Did half and half, beautiful loaf. Thank you
you're crazy-funny! I love it!  ;0)
Good job jenny
Thanks for your video.  I'm going to try make my own bread.
proof there is lots of perverts on the Internet lots of spanking comments
lol..you are a cutie pie
you are too funny
Can you freeze the bread with the milk and egg? If you drop both, how much water?
Although it might not be as funny, if you want to warm an egg up, you can put it in some hot tap water for a few minutes.
I loved your video and subscribed to your channel. I just hope that cleanup was easy, lol......on yourself
At 3' 57'' ... "who's your daddy?" OMG ... You're killing me Jenny!
"Who's your daddy" LMFAO WHY
Who's your Daddy! Spank that dough.
good job
ohh Jenny.. ur so cute.. I love yaaa... 😚 love ur kitchen..
How can the recipe be modified to remove the milk and egg?    (Milk and egg allergies.)
jenny you make it look so easy
I totally enjoyed watching your video.  Love your humor!  You are sooo cute!!
Hi Jenny, I use to make bread every Friday. Thanks for the video I'll be sure and try this one.
super like your video...keep it up.
Knocked my socks off! This recipe created the loaf that I have been looking for. The rising took longer than expected, but I didn't take into account springback, so the bread came out really tall. I haven't seen a loaf of whole wheat bread rise like that. I will be making another loaf using freshly milled hard white flour. Thanks for this.
oh ty so so  much for this video so cool and helpfull, :)
hi, loved this video. I love soft milk bread a lot, so was wondering, is it possible to make milk bread with whole wheat flour??
Omg Jenny Jones! Who would've thought? I always used to watch you everyday and you're still just as beautiful and young looking.
hi Jenny, is the egg necessary..? can we do it without the egg?
PANE? NOOOO. ..IN ITALIA NON SI FA COSÌ!  E POI L'UOVO NON CI STA PROPRIO.....UN SALUTO
we love your style Jen!
thank you so much... i realy love it
who's your daddy indeed damn lol
Just made it and this recipe is perfect!!!
Thank you I never need to buy bread again!
Egg in bread? Hell no! If you guys want really good bread recipes, check the dutch channel "Leo Pelzer" out.
hi there again, can this recipe be doubled.  Also coud i add walnuts and raisins

Lady, you are a scream!  Comedian  must have been the calling that you missed!  All in all, I think I like you!

Hi Jenny  I have just made your whole  wheat bread and it turned out soo great I couldn't believe it but thanks so much.

hello,i like you video alot.i have a hard time with bread,and im trying to find a proper cooking heat and time in my oven to make the round loaves i like.my dough doesnt look as nice and smooth as yours either.im just a beginner with breadi make mine in a cast iron pot.just wondering the heat and time.i think its 6 quarts capacity.thanks for your video,just need help :) cheers

You are cool and you are funny  thank you    😀😊👌🤗👏🙏😊🙏
Just finished baking my second loaf of this wonderful bread! Last week's loaf gone! Won't buy another loaf when we can have a FRESH loaf whenever we need or want it.
what is the grean pad you are using as  a work surface?
I love your channel
You are refreshing  and you have beautiful hands.
thanks . can we have the exact measurements pls
never  made bread before but  using  your recipe it turn out  delicious and successful! thank u so much for sharing!
Thanks! Just did the recipe, but with AP flour. Loaves a bit puffyier, but sweet momma, they turned out well.
A如何煑粥
Used the recipe, Turned out so well.Thank you
I made a loaf without egg and it came out good. It does taste sweet, so next time I will not put any sugar, and a litttle more salt.
whose ur daddy she says ... Lmao.  Ur adorable Jenny. Love your videos !!
This video is hilarious! Love your show!
This is an awesome recipe. I made some tweaks, though. Instead of sugar, I'm using stevia and the salt I use is Himalayan pink salt. I also throw in some garlic powder and flax seeds. The bread turns out soooo good. I also noticed that if you use hot milk and oil, you don't need to knead it as much with your hands. I only had to knead it about 10-20 times and I do all this by hand.
After she said "whose your daddy", I hit the subscribe button. She's got me sold. Baking with her will be the furthest thing from a bore!
Watched this today and thought....ok I'll give it a go.....family LOVED IT!! It's all GONE! Making another one tonight and another in the morning. Definitely a keeper 😁 Thank you for sharing 😊
How long does it keep? And where or how should u store it
To the bread --> "Who's your daddy???"   I did not expect that. LMAO
LOL- you kill me with your humor Jenny!!
lol I loved the ending of your video...what you getting married? "crap forgot about the egg" hehehehe Jenny you are on funny woman, guess It is the polish in you. not knocking polish people as I am polish myself :)
whos your dady...lol
3:58 "Who's your Daddy" ^_^
what can i use instead of egg?
lady you funny love your video's.
Love it!  I'm 62 years old and just now.....am learning how to make bread.  My problem comes with the handling of the bread and getting it shaped nicely for the pan.  Now I know how to do it.  Thank-you so much!
For the flour can I just use all AP flour?
😳 my face at 3:55
you must be wondering about the base of yeast, it MUST BE the finest and easy to resolve powder, corn!!!!!  Always go back to the recipe of 'Corn Flakes' that we all know!
How to make bread with out gluten .... Pls
I just subscribed, you do great tutorials and I love your sense of humor!!!
love this recipe thanks. it's so forgiving and even people that say they don't like brown bread like it
wow the ending was great thank you for the laugh and how to make a wonderful loaf of bread !!
Used this recipe...ohmygoodness soo good!! Love you Jenny!!
Awesome video....  Easy and interesting..  Basically its not boring like the other bunch of bake a bread videos...  But i have 2 questions...  1. Any substitute of egg ( vegetarian problem)?  and 2. Can't i just microwave it..  If yes then any specific instructions.?   Looking forward to cook some delicious bread😁😄
This recipe is brilliant. I've made 5-6 loaves of bread (wheat and white based on the first two cups of flour) with it and other than the slight variation I will note below, it's worked perfectly every time. This bread is exactly as good as more complicated recipes I've used that require 2 or more hours of rising and lots more tiresome kneading.   I will say that before I found this recipe I spent around a year experimenting on and off, and I do think bread normally requires a little patience, finesse, and experience, but this is the quickest, easiest recipe with consistently good results, and you can almost whip up bread on a quick whim instead of having to decide to do it ahead of time. (Seriously, other recipes you need to start no later than the afternoon if you want the bread that night.)  I made most of my loaves last summer and the recipe worked exactly as she said, one 35 minute rise other than the ten minute rest before shaping the loaf.  I just made another wheat loaf tonight (this is in late December) and the only difference is the rise seemed to be going nowhere after 15 minutes. I believe this is a combo of the same jar of yeast being 4 or 5 months older, and the fact that it's under 30 degrees outside and the kitchen is colder. When I noticed the bread wasn't rising, I put it covered on top of the stove and preheated the oven under it to 375. The rise ended up taking a total of 45-50 minutes but it finally got there (if I'd have turned on the stove at the beginning it likely would have been the normal 35 min.) I believe Jenni is in CA without such outdoor temperature variation, so she might not have experienced this.   My tips - you don't want the milk "hot". If you don't have a thermometer, get it luke-warm. Think of the temperature you'd want to give milk to a baby; just barely warm but unable to cause pain if you touch it. Milk that's too hot will kill your yeast.   I have accidentally forgotten to add the egg to this recipe and it didn't really seem to hurt anything, so don't let lack of eggs stop you from trying this. It might be more important when you use whole wheat flour with less gluten - just make sure there's some regular flour in the mix (the last half cup, then the 1/4 cup you add at the end of the mix.) Normal bread recipes do not usually call for an egg, so it does seem to be just insurance to tighten the inner crumb.
You can warm an egg is by putting for a couple of minutes in hot/warm tap water. And I use the hook for the dough mixer,  and I let it knead it for 5 min. It shuts off by himself. No hand kneading. I am not good at counting, as I don't know what language to use, LOL
spank that dough baby! !! whose yr daddy! !!
dziekuje bardzo.
Did this work for anyone ?
great jenny .. appreciate your idea...keep going :)
Hello Jenny, I loved your bread recipe, and I tried it too and it turned out so well. Thankyou for showing such an easy way to make bread at home. Loved it!
Jenny, this was my first attempt at making bread.  I substituted and used WH Sprouted flour in place of the regular WH.  Other than that I followed your directions to the tee.  I was amazed my bread turned out perfect, tasted great and didn't last long enough to cool.   Thanks for the great recipe.
"Gotta spank that dough. Who's your daddy?" You made me laugh. =D  I enjoy making bread and want to try your recipe. lately I've been using my bread machines more because recurring tendonitis makes kneading difficult some days. I have a Cuisinart stand mixer but I'm not crazy about the dough hook, either. My biggest challenge is shaping loaves correctly. I found your video as related to one I was watching about making pasta dough in a bread machine. New subscriber!
After I put the dough into the tin to rise, I formed a tent over it with foil, then set it aside until needed.  Made it easy to control. Great recipe, by the way.
Just subscribed even thou I've been watchin your videos for a while. Great work and who's your daddy was hilarious. I forgot to mention: love your spatulas collection. I have to say the egg thing in your bra was out of this world. I was on the floor laughing. You are so funny. Keep adding funny moments to your videos it makes them delicious just like the food your are presenting. Crap, I didn't expect that at the end. Just wonderful. Loved it.
thank you ....thank you thousands times ..u really made my day today ...👍👍
Whose your daddy lol 😂😂😂😜😜😜😜
She's so cute, makes the videos enjoyable even if you're not interested in baking bread.
Jenny, how come you don't use the dough hook?
very cute beginning, Jenny!
Great recipies, could watch these videos all day and cook all day too.
Jenny you are so fun to watch!  Love your recipes and your sense of humour. More polish recipes please! Love from Australia
you are so amazing, with your easy-going cuisine recipes
is it possible to make this bread whith yeast (the white one) usualy used for cake...is it possible?
hello dr..thanks a lot for your recipe..will try it tomorrow..could you please tell me oven temperature in ℃?
Lol lov it
This looks sooo good, when the wife goes to bed tonight I'm going to give it a go ...... the bread that is. Love your style of humour, made me chuckle
her reaction at the end was like mine when I saw this giant beautiful bread 😆 So excited to try this like now 😀
I want that bread!
Every ingredient i have but one, you rock!  Love this girl, olive oil works, regular flour, any type of milk, whatever easy breezy bread.  what a better show this one is!
OMG!!! YES!  Have I really found Jenny after all these years! Whatsup girl!  Looking forward to the Crusty Rolls video next!
ha ha ha love the egg bit .
Super
wow, thanks!
hi jenny, I made this bread today. my question is, my dough did not rise or puff.. what could have been the problem.the bread tasted delicious.will try it again
Good encouraging ,intellectual,delicious bread making recepie.... I'm  doing itright now seeing ur wonderful video. Thank you so much for such practical way of explanation...
im interested with it,
The most dumb recipe ever.. tried twice and both the times the bread came out extremely dense and was not at all edible.
Who's your daddy
You are awesome!  Thank you so much for all your efforts to share and make life nicer for others!
Really well-done video.  I'll make it today and give it away this afternoon to a friend who loves whole wheat bread.
I hate egg
Hi Jen l love your spatula collection and your kitchen today I will do the whole wheat bread recipe wish me 😊luck
Hi Jenny, I just got introduced to this channel.  This recipe is great. What can I use in substitute of eggs please?  Dinesh
Thank you.
loved the spanking part ;)
lol I am so dead ! 😂😂😂
already dude....lol
This is the by far the best homemade bread recipe that I have come across. I tried it and it turned out perfect! Very soft and delicious! The only thing I did differently was add 3 teaspoons of yeast instead of 2. I actually baked two, one with only whole wheat flour and the other with only all purpose flour. Both turned out perfectly! I love this recipe! Oh and I did it all by hand!
I think I might use a different food for grains.... This is a lot of work...

jenny I tried the whole wheat bread recipe and I don't know what I am doing wrong but the was runny even with all the flour. i  checked all the ingredients and I had all of them according to your recipe. HELP!!
this bread tastes good but my stomach kind of rebels. Can you please make sour dough bread? Thanks!
hey Jenny I love ur recipies as they r so simple. the bread turned out great. I added a lot of shredded spinach to increase the nutritional value. thanks again 👍
Dear Jenny, i have been learning to bake bread for the past few months n have had a few hits n misses.This recipe of yours is truly amazing. Easy to follow and the bread turned out crusty outside n soft inside and  had this beautiful bread texture. My family is so proud of me and i am proud of myself too. Your videos are a delight to watch  and you have such a pleasant n sweet personality. god bless you for the good job you are doing . Thanks again.
Where Do I know this lady from? I mean day time show in the past?   Was she  a talk show host or something?
jenny. great  recipe. do you have use yeast to make bread. yeast  sensitive?
Beautiful kitchen. Thank you for the video
3:58 Spank that dough who's you're daddy. She is funny.
Never knew making bread was so easy. Thanks
you're so funny
Jenny I adore you and this is by far my favorite bread recipe video (and trust me I've watched soooo many lately). Can't wait to try it.  You rock young lady! You're always funny but for some reason this video made my giggle more. Thanks for sharing this one.
thanks very much jen
I came here to learn the correct pronunciation of Wheat , I do Wit but some of my frnds do Wet. Got confused. Anyway this helps.
can i use water instead of milk ?
LOL!!!!!
i just made it
Your awesome!!!!
Love you Jenny!
Thanks!! Very easy to make it.
Mine did not rise :-(
If you ever need to borrow a kitchen, you are welcome to use mine!
You are just the best... where have you been all my life, Holllllyyyy craaaap!!!! <3
lols the egg haha!! funny
i just love your cute little trick about spatulas.. i LOVE the colors..
Hahaha Jenny, you're awesome!!! Great tips and really fun to watch you explain :D hugssssss
I LIKE YOUR RECIPE IT'S SIMPLE AND EASY  TO DO,I WILL DEFINITELY TRY IT.
Still love you Jenny miss your TV show✌️️
you are awesome
Not sure if you will see my comments, but your video is truely awesome! I really appreciate the no ads part too :)
Who's your daddy? 😂😂😂
How to  Cy
You're amazing!!! Love your jokes!!!
Is it inappropriate to tell you I LOVE U!! i love this recipe too.. Thanks so much Jenny
i do this recipe in my breadmaker comes out perfectly ty
where?
She says you don't have to grease the pan but I would suggest you do.  My loaf stuck and split.
lol!! she's funny.
ur kitchen utensils are so nice
any chance you can break this down into UK weights and measures..thanks..
I only have whole wheat pastry flour :-(
Went and searched and browsed and could not find the recipe. Would it had been too hard to either pasted it or put a link to the recipe above? Thanks...
lol what did you do with the egg
wwwwww
I'd rather use all 100% whole wheat flour instead of that all purpose processed garbage. The idea of making it homemade is to make it as healthy as possible.
Wow I was shocked to see you cooking lol. I remember your show back in the day. Good to see you somewhere else still at it. I guess this is why they call this channel Jenny Can Cook. Take care Jenny.
Hi jenny . I love your recipes . I have tried your impossible coconut pie .  Can you please tell me , how many days ,can I keep the bread in the fridge . I live in Sri Lanka . Thanks
Mam i m a professional cook in Pakistan, but here is no value, what i do?
I made this and it was hard to take out of my pan 😞😞  "Who's your daddy" 😂😂😂😂😂
hhhhhh you are gorgeous and fun to watch you nice video and i love your shirt
i made it..thanks a lot..
😂 who's your daddy lol... Wow beautiful bread thanks for sharing
I will try this bread soon :) I won t forget to spank him 😂
Great vlog..Thanks for sharing.x
Hey Jenny, l wanted to make a loaf of white bread this morning, so l just substituted the whole wheat flour for all purpose and it came out perfectly. I successfully used the dough hook and did no hand kneeding.... so easy! Thanks for you videos!
WOW!!!! GREAT RECIPE👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼so EASY !!! THANKS FOR SHARING
hi Jenny, please suggest an alternate for egg.
Jenny you are sooooooooooo funny!
HAHAHAH SO CUTE
Whoops it's ok I found your recipes lol !
Wow Jenny that looks so easy I must try this I have just found your site love it  from Linda down under 🇦🇺👍where can I see the ingredients ?
I just made it and it worked beautifully, great recipe! But the fact that it is made with milk + the egg makes it too rich in my opinion, would it work with water? (I'm new to making bread)
Can you suggest any replacement for egg?will yogurt work?
hahaha...Love your egg in the clevage trick..lol
If you don't grease the pan, it WILL stick to the bottom of the pan for sure! It is very tasty. I enjoyed making it. A fresh, warm slice with a little butter and honey makes a yummy breakfast or snack. Using a serrated bread knife makes beautiful cuts. Use a sawing motion when slicing.
I love to following whatever recipes you made, and been wonderful for me so far.And I love watching you :-D
Great recipe! I've never been able to make a loaf of wholewheat bread as good as this. Thanks Jenny.
"gotta spank that dough" *spank* *spank* spank* "whos your daddy!" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Jenny, where had you been?  I missed you!  Just found you here on YouTube. I love whole wheat bread along with whole multigrain, sourdough and pumpernickel breads. I like a big, heavy, dense, firm, moist loaf that I can cut into thick slices and freeze. The best toast for eating or sandwiches is just slightly golden perfection made with frozen, thick slices of bread.   Thanks for a wonderful baking class! Happy toasting!!!
Hi Jenny.  LOVE this recipe and have always made it with quick acting yeast.  If I use regular, do I have to let it rise twice?
ok you are my kinda lady! i use my cleavage as an everyday tool as well.
She got me AT: WHO IS YOUR DADDY?? (^_^)
Thank you Jenny😊Maraming Salamat in our Language 😊
Thanks Jenny,another question 😊what do you mean aerate your flour before measuring ?
"You can't make me".  You sound like my wife ! ! !
Sam's Club sells 2 pounds of yeast for the price of several packets.  You can keep it in the freezer for years.
can i use bread flour only for this recipe?
Thank you so much Jenny.. made it with complete whole wheat flour, but i've added flax-seeds to get the elastic structure, and i've divided it into two baking pots, been too much to handle in one, mine are small.. I wish I could add photos to show you the final result :( smells great though... and looks amazing!! thanks again :)
Hello Jenny  Can you please confirm that your loaf tin is 2lb (as it seems to be) - I bought a 1lb tin and want to make a 1lb size bread so I would need to halve the ingredients you use - if your tin is 2lb. Thanks!
I only make bread a couple times a year but i always go to your recipes. thanks
On the back counter... that's a lot of spatulas!!! Enough to last a few lifetimes indeed!
This was my very first  video  of yours and you have  me hooked. by the way down to earth  And funny great combo
thank you
LOVE your format!  Everything was going great until the bread came out of the oven...looked beautiful!!!!  But couldn't get it out of the pan...when I finally dug it out with a plastic knife so I wouldn't scratch the brand-new non-stick Wilton loaf pan, it left an inch of bread on the bottom and up the sides.   Next time, will ignore instructions that say don't grease the pan!  But the decimated loaf tasted wonderful, so sliced and froze for toast.
can i use this recipe to make pull apart bread? thankyou!! awesome video
has anyone tried this recipe over here? please reply thanks :)
Also how can I make it eggless please?
Hi Jenny ! Tx ! Can we make wholewheat focaccia too??

Hi Jenny. I share the same sentiment. I don't buy bread anymore. Loving all your colourful kitchen stuff. Where did you buy them? Btw, you're funny and I like your video. Thanks for sharing.
Made this bread yesterday and it was a successful. It was soft and tasty. Thanks, Jenny.
اتمنى أن تستفيد ربات المنازل من عمل الخبز وتنجزه بالمنزل وهو سهل وعمل جميل ومفيد 'كما اشكر كل الذي قاموا بانجازم.
That surprise at the end really startled me. It caught me off guard.
I tried ur receipe...the bread came out like a store one....thank you for the good receipe...keep it up
I get the chills when i see people putting flour on their hands it's kinda like someone screeching there hand on chalkboard same feeling.
how much sugar?
Before I watched this video, I made 4 loaves of bread that wouldn't rise. This was so easy and I was finally successful. You're a life saver!
can i make it without egg
I love your humour and you are fun.  Thanks for sharing.  Such a good sport, too...
Will need to give this a try soon.
Ohh so you're the "who's your daddy" lady? 😂😂
I made this bread today and it was wonderful. My whole family loved it.
I love how colorful your kitchen is.  I try to do the same thing - it really makes going into the kitchen fun.
You are awesome Jenny! My 7 year old daughter and myself loved watching it together, especially the last part... :-)
Wow +jenny can cook, I always watched and loved your talk show and am thrilled to find you on YouTube. I very much hope you'll continue to make videos (about anything)  because your personality is golden 👍😁
I did my first ever bread by using your recipe, the bread turned out alright! Thank you!
I LOVE YOUR VIDEO AND YOU WOW JUST LOVE THE WAY YOU MAKE ME SMILE IN YOUR FUN WAY OF COOKING..THANK YOU  sorry about the caps but i just forget to click it off  love your bread making
Just baked a fresh loaf and it came out perfectly, thank you for your very clear instructions Jenny, thank you,  Remain blessed .!!!! All the way from Namibia😃😃😃
This is great! Can I use this without eggs?
Can u make a video on how u slice your bread and bag it ??
Can u make a video on how u slice your bread and bag it ??
LOL LOL LOL Jenny you are so cute in your videos.  The whole wheat bread recipe is a great one and you make it so quick and easy.  But, I will make very sure that the first thing I will do is get out my egg to get it to room temperature . LOL That was a cute addition to your video about the cleavage.  Keep up the GREAT work  you're a natural
Jenny I have got to tell you, I have been watching you for some time now and you really are one of my favorite cooks.  I lived in France for 12 years and learned a lot about making breads along with other pastry and general cooking.  I love cooking and baking in very traditional ways but I have to tell you that your no kneed bread recipe is the best and I use it all the time.  Your web site with all your recipes is second to none, what a complete and beautiful web site.  BRAVO JENNY
You made me giggle while watching your great video!
I find that adding up to 25% amaranth flour to wheat flour boosts the flavour of bread and biscuits a lot.  Try it.  That's 1/2 cup amaranth flour for 2 cups wheat flour.
what can be substituted for eggs?
Lol, I thought I was the only one who spanked his dough
Jenny how are you doing,  you are a professional great bread thanks for your recipe  I got to try it .
Hi, Do you think we can do this recipe in a bread machine?
Wow, you look so young.  Your instructions are so clear and simple.
I followed all the steps except that, I beat the egg for couple of minutes and then added.  Bread looks dense. It's not airy or spongy. Where did I miss? Was the time given for fermenting not enough? Can you please advice?
whos your daddy lol
Can I sub the eggs with something ? we dont eat eggs....The rest of the process is great enough for me to try ! Look forward to hearing from you :)
Can I replace the milk with water ?
I have been watching your channel a lot recently and every time I saw you I thought man she looks so familiar to me!! Then I thought maybe she just reminds me of Martha Stewart but NO! I figured it out you are Jenny Jones like the talk show Jenny Jones! I used to watch your show all the time as a child....I'm happy I figured it out!
You just made me want to make bread!  :)  Thank you !!   Who is your daddy hahaha!
She's fun to watch, a beautiful soul
can I use water insteadof milk
Beautiful loaf, will give it a try, thanks....
Whose your. Daddy
Girl u funny....slap that bread and said "who's your Daddy lmao!!! Great recipe I will try!!
You can also put the egg in a cup of very warm water.  I've done that when I get all my ingredients out for cake making and realize that my eggs are still refrigerator cold.  I'm surely going to have to dry this recipe!  My mom and I used to make bread when I was a kid and I miss it, but it always seemed like sooo...much...work!
I am fan Jenny.. Excellent explanations..
Can someone help me out here? My bread sticks to the pan at the bottom (the rest of the bread is brilliant though) Any tips for it to not stick to the bottom?
This is the first time I've viewed her channel. I love her. I'm going to try this recipe this week. Thank you!
You're delightful, Jenny! Come back and make more videos, please. :)
H👍👍👍
Thank you Jenny, I love watching your videos, you are so funny, you make me laugh all the times. Keep it up. Great of humor. Thump Up
Please continue doing more recipes. Need u back Jenny!!!!
Right on 👌lol..i💖spatulas too. Shes funny.LOVE her.
I bought a used Kitchen Aid so I could make this bread.  It came out perfect the first time and it is SO EASY.  Jenny is a genius.  This is the only whole wheat bread I will make.  I grind my own wheat berries (soft white berries) for super fresh and nutritious bread.
hahahahaah.. rreeaaallyy.. u broke an egg!..hahahahha
Are you married? Interested?
Tad I

I'm usually terrible at baking but this recipe NEVER fails! Thanks so much!!! <3
Can I make the same presses but with only regular flour without adding the other flour, .
OMG!  You are soooo funny!  I have had no luck with making Whole Wheat Bread using my bread machine.   I am going to try your method tonight, when I get home from work.

Oh my God

LOL

wow thank u mam for the video cilip.
where do you get your beautiful 'boards' and colorful spatulas?
I think it would be easier to time the 50 turns than to count to 50,  and much easier still if you don't have a mixer and must turn 150 times!
Greetings from Serbia! Learning how to cook stuff. Keep up the good work!:)
Good
found you...while searching for bread. and now I just love you. you are so good. greetings from India.
Hello Jenny! I just used your recipe to bake a loaf, and the result is just perfect. Nothing is better than a perfect recipe from a beautiful lady! Thank you again for your video!

Jenny my wife did this recipe yesterday and we would like to tell you it is awesome and thank you for the information. We are passing it on to our daughter.
im 23 and she makes me blush haha
When kneading you really should push the bone of your palm hard into the dough, not just with your fingers.  Great recipe!
Is it ok without using milk? Some people don't take dairy products
THANK YOU BEAUTIFUL LADY :)
lol Jenny Jones cooks coo.
just tried it. its sooo good. love your recepies abd the fact you do many Polish (kinda) dishes. :)
My bread came out brilliant in half the time for baking :) i did use whey as well and the result was perfect! Thank u so much!!
Como posso traduzir esse pão?
Haha you are so cute:-) I love your videos!
I just could not stop laughing when u said who's your daddy..........................anyways nice videos ........u earned a sub
Haha.. Love the closing joke :D Thanks for your sharing.. This is my first time coming to your channel 😍😍
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHO'S YOUR DADDY?! LMAO
Jenny I really enjoy your video's  I own a bread maker machine coz I am a MALE You are so adorable, love your smile Wish you would make a few vids using a bread machine,  you know,, for us MALE's
"whos your daddy" 😂😂😂😂😂
What a lovely loaf of bread, I see why you no longer buy bread. This is a keeper! Mine came out great on my first try, it slices well and makes great toast and bread for sandwiches. Thanks
I have always wondered where Jenny had disappeared to. Glad I bumped into your channel looking for bread recipes. Thank you for sharing.
thankyou so so so much for these wonderful recipes! I've been looking for whole wheat recipes for a while and all of them have been so dense. I used your recipe and made three batches. made olive flat bread with one, mini oatmeal loaves with another and caramelized onion loaf with the third. the onion loaf rose alot during its proving but sank from the middle when it baked. it didn't look like the one in your video but that was probably because of the onions. everything tastes really nice and smells even nicer. the best part is that it's so so much lighter than the other breads I've made. I'm so glad I found you :')
Mam ,can we do this without egg ,if one is allergic to it ,anything to replace an egg?
🇱🇴🇻🇪 🇮🇹💜💜 JENNY YOU ARE GREAT
Lol "who's your daddy?"  I like her!
My girlfriend made this recipie and it came out great! And she did it all by hand too! look like I have to put a ring on it!

Hi Jenny, love your videos... quick question... can omit the egg altogether and bake an eggless bread? Love your sense of humour!

Can v make without egg Jenny ,v hate the egg of the smell on the bread .
Can you just use white flour instead of wheat if you want white bread?
Thank you so much Jenny for your time and this great recipe!
can you please show us next time the texture from the inside... simpathiques vidéos, thanks Jenny!
you're videos are great and I love you're sense of humor. GREAT JOB!
I love so much your way in cooking. Thank you so much you make my day.

Jenny, I love your videos! You are so fun to watch!! )))))))))
I laughed so hard when she slapped the dough and said who's your daddy 😂😂 The way how she made the bread is exactly how I remember making it when I was younger. Thanks a bunch Jenny
I am a pampered chef consultant and I prepared this recipe with my PC products and it was amazing!!! So easy! It makes me feel like a real baker :)
IVE FOUND THE MEME I SEE ALL OVER INSTAGRAM. I FEEL LIKE IVE DONE SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE.
This bread is very "short" and grainy compared with my kneaded, twice raised bread. That said, it is  easy, and tastes good.
Thanks Jenny I like a higher wheat bread like that
Where do you buy the spatulas and the lovely green board?I am making bread this recipe for the very first time I am at the 35 min rise period...Ohhhhh I am 51 have been scared to try bread so....
Jenny, would you have a recipe for Bleu Cheese Salad dressing? - I think in USA you call it Roquefort dressing?
You are so funny, thank you for your great recipes! Greetings from Germany :)
PLEASE UNDERSTAND if I don't answer your questions. I never expected this many people to watch my videos and view my recipes - 50,000 people a day from 200 countries! I'm truly honored but honestly, I can no longer keep up with the questions. Please look for answers in the comments, online, or look at all the comments (and the FAQs) on my website: www.JennyCanCook.com. I don't do this for money, just for my love of cooking. There are no ads on my website and many questions are addressed there. Thank you for understanding.
anyone ever notice that people baking with flour wear black? Just funny !
wow this video was a WILD ride   by the way can I omit the sugar?
thanks Jenny for your easy to  bread recipe. btw, you made me laugh on the last part of your video. cheers to you!
I'm brazilian and I just loved the way you cook. I can relate to you in many things.. I mean, you're funny and such a colorful person with a beautiful soul. May God bless you sista ♡
Thank you Jenny, I am from myanmar and I am trying to bake my own bread. Your video is very useful for me. Before watching yours, my own making bread is just only for my dog. Now, I am quite ok and will try to open my own bread shop.  :);)
The best cooking site I have ever found!
hahaha my 4 year old son said "IM GUNNA MARRY HER!" then yelled "SHE MADE BREAD!" so when the end came about marriage that just put the icing on the cake err bread!
it is realy easy I like it, but let me know if possible to use white flour instead of wheat. thank u Jenny keep it.
напишите пожалуйста рецепт в описании под видео
это прекрасно!!!!!!
I really like your sense of humour! I had to watch the recipe twice becaue I kept getting distracted by all the gorgeous colours & wondering what utensils they were. Great recipes!
I found your recipe/channel Googling for "light wholemeal bread", and how lucky am I?  Brilliant, worked the first (and 2nd) time I tried it, using spelt wholemeal, and all the family love it.  Light, tasty, easy.  Thank you!  And I love your sense of humour!  Exup (UK)
Thank you sooo much my bread turned out AMAZING and fluffy and delicious <3 this is the first time making this and im def making this everyday
I really enjoy drinking and using on my cereal the Almond and Cashew milks. Have you ever tried either of those for making bread?
can you make it without eggs?
who's your daddy ??????
Hi Jenny. Can I use a parchment paper instead of the foil one?
ur are an amazing presenter ! i couldnt stop laughing
She is hilarious! I love her last part with warming the egg and the clip that comes up right after the movie finishes. So awesome!
I made this today and it turned out exactly like your loaf. This bread is delicious. Thank you so much for the recipe. I love your sense of humour. I warmed up the egg in my pocket. But I made sure no surprises! LOL
You remind me of a pretty actress but I can not put a name with it.
WHOS YOUR DADDY lmao
I never expected that so many people would watch my videos and use my website - over 50,000 a day from 200 countries!  I love all the positive feedback but I simply can't keep up with the questions any more. I did my best up until now but the numbers keep growing and I just can’t do it.   I never did this for money. I did it for my love of cooking and I just wanted to share my recipes. I've addressed the most commonly asked questions in the FAQs on my website ( http://www.JennyCanCook.com ) so please go there for answers. I've posted just about everything I know there and you'll see thousands of helpful comments from other cooks as well as lots more of my recipes. There are no ads on my website. Thanks for understanding.
My husband like raisins in his bread when would put them in.
Jenny have you ever been on tv.??
LMNO!! Thank you Ms. Jenny. Very clear instructions. Can I add nuts, raisins, almonds etc? I'll get that egg for ya lol.
Great video, thanks. Technically, whole wheat (especially fresh ground) has less gluten than processed white bread flour. The reason is the whole grain is used which by weight results in less gluten. Consequently, many whole wheat recipes recommend the addition of a tablespoon or so of gluten.
and just like that..i click the subscribe button. I
Thanks jenny for the recipe. It worked out well for me and it's yummy. thanks for the humor. Made my day, been watching quite few time and never get bored.
Love this recipe. Thanks. You forgot one of those beautiful aprons!!! Love everything you do..yum..and you sure made me jump with the egg thingy..LOL
LOL! Love it!!!
Saturday was our 1st loaf was made by my 10 year old Granddaughter.    It turned out wonderful.  We used White  Whole Wheat and instead of sugar we used Honey.  Sunday we made 4 loaves using regular whole wheat,  I added a Tbl of Vital Gluten and a Tbl of white vinegar (The vinegar helps to reduce the harsh taste of whole wheat.)  One I forgot and it did turn out just as good.   This is a keeper and is already in my book of favorites.  Thanks Jenny.  BTW we love your videos.
thanks for the sense of humor mom :D
You are really sweet.
Thank you Jenny!  I made my first bread loaf alongside this video and it came out perfect!!! Now I too want spatulas!! :-)
you are nice.
you crack me up. Question when you set the bread to rise, can you set it in the oven? And  do you have the oven on?
I understand this is a whole wheat bread recipe but could I just ran out of whole wheat flour :/ If I replace it for all purpose flour, will it still work? Btw I LOVE all your videos! You have such a great sense of humor. It's never boring to watch your videos!
I like you, smiles.  Thanks for the demonstration, I'm trying it now....
Good morning thank you so much for your videos I've  watched quite a few this has been a great gift my daughter and myself she's 29 I was very busy mother in her early years so I didn't do really any baking and now I see  that was a mistake you made it so simple and so much fun we are totally enjoying learning to bake together so again thank you have a great day. Btw   i use organic whole wheat pastry flour ( bob red mill) I'd only been using a quarter of a teaspoon yeast  was thinking " well I'm not doing something right" I couldn't get my bread to rise good enough now I know what the issue is because of this video after my morning coffee I will be starting a new loaf. Wish me luck I think this is going to be the best loaf yet lol using the proper amount of yeast could make all the difference =) have a great day.

Om Shanti Jenny, Much Love, Could i ask you a question ? How do create Colors in Life ? Just joiking i also creating rainbow in life come what may, adding colors in simple things that we have access to ? So coming back to question - where do you buy such cute colorful spatulas ? Is there any specif store you get from ? OM SHANTI ANGEL JENNY.
She sure likes a good spanking 😊
why do u have so much spatulas ?
hi Jenny!  can I use a nut milk?  the bread looks delicious.
I wish she were my neighbor she is very funny and a delight.
Awesome!!! Its the real deal.. Bread came out fantastic!!
I love it! Thank you. I love all your videos
I made this tonight. Very easy and it turned out better than expected, since I haven't made bread in more than 20 years. I tampered with the recipe by adding 1 TBSP milled flax seed. Yum. Thanks, Jenny!
Mommy Jenny Can Cook you are the best 7:15 is very memorable :)
this is quick and easy,  also soft and it taste good
Jenny, how do you get your bread to rise in 35 min? Mine takes several hours.
Hi Jenny, I have missed your show on television. I am glad that you are here on YouTube!!!!!!
You are awesome!  High energy, generous in spirit, knowledgeable, and warmly reassuring.  My crew eats a loaf of bread a meal, so I am going to bake this loaf over and over again! Thank you.
Love your videos! I just throw everything in my Cuisinart food processor and don't have to knead it.
7:14 The best.
I just had this bread for my lunch. I make it every Sunday, and I just love it. I wrote the recipe and sent it to my mom in Iran, and she has baked the bread 3 times so far. Thank you. I enjoy your channel very much.
I jumped when I heard the egg crack
Hahahahhahaha you're hilarious alright I love your videos.
who's your daddy!! xD
HA she's funny
AWWWW!! "whos your daddy~" You are so cute lol <3 And the bread look great
hahaha who's your daddy. Learnt a lot more then just making a bread
did anyone else cracked up like crazy when she started to spank the dough and said "who's your daddy"??? I was just NOT expecting that from this decent, sweet older lady hahah she's s random. Thanks for the awesome recipe and the great sense of humour, Jenny!
This is an awesome recipe that most certainly works
" *WHO IS YOUR DADDY YOU LITTLE DOUGH* "
Hi Jenny! Do you ever use the dough hook? I really hate that thing! I'm going to start using the regular mixing paddle.
can you write your recipe in comment please ? and I have subscribed to your channel and I thumbed up this video
Hi Jenny, I loove Jenny Can Cook...always watch it.. And for the bread..i have a question... will the bread be stale after an hour?  or it will be as soft as it was when you took it out from the oven?
BTW, do you have a recipe for hamburger buns? :-)
Made your recipe today.  Easy and delicious.  Thank you!
This recipe turned out FANTASTIC for me. However, I have some comments. In the video, Jenny says regular yeast is okay, but on the printed recipe it points out to use a lower temp of milk if you use regular yeast and not rapid rise. I used rapid rise, so I don't know if it will make a difference or not. The printed recipe says to use 110 degree milk if you use regular yeast. Other than that, my first attempt to bake this was wonderful and I love it. I wonder if I could use this with rye flour? I am going to try it, and see what happens. Thank you, Jenny Can Cook, for this great recipe!
Jenny, I tried your recipe for the 1st time. An for the 1st time (in so many years) I finally have a bread that both my husband and can enjoy. It works! Thank you so much for restoring my confidence in bread making
great and super easy recipe！！Thanks Jenny..hope to see more recipes from you^_^
Truely amazing...just luv her....lol
I just made this. I have to say this came out soft and tender . very rich and delicious. unfortunately it didn't last 5 minute on the table. lol thanks so much Jenny for this wonderful recipe.
Jenny you are such a delightful  chef ! Love your practical recipes. Thank q!
looks good, u are funny, u made me laugh.
Who's your daddy?!! Lol.. Love it... Great recipe and entertaining!
you are so funny and beautiful
I like your video...I like your Kitchen tools........thank you for sharing this
Jenny havnt seen you in years...but love these videos lol..luv the recipes too
thank you. simple and I will try it for sure.
No why would I put food in my breast???? I cant do this. sighhhh
Can you try to make Ezekiel bread? Love your funny, very entertaining videos!! =D that egg crack is totally on point!
I think that you are wonderful and funny and sexy and on top of that, you can cook. Love you Jenny. Cooking should be like you do it, nice and simple and tasty.
Jenny you're so hot BUT three times now I've followed the recipe and my rise (no pun intended) has taken 2hrs to get over the brim of the same size loaf tin. I've tested the yeast in warm water and its alive and bubbling. It's also dense and very crumbly? What's the height of your tin?
great!
You are very entertaining
Jenny, where can I buy that mini KitchenAid mixer timer? It's cute.
Hi, this is my first video I have seen of yours and I have already subscribed! Thank you!
My mama spanked the dough when she made flour tortillas. Thank you for the beautiful flashbacks and the wonderful bread recipe. Thank you for sharing with us. Blessings to all.
You are so great. Going to try this recipe too!!! You  made me laugh with the egg.. LOL!!!!! Thanks for making the tutorial. I just learned how to make a great milk bread yesterday. I have to fine tune it :) but it tasted amazing. And now I'm going to try your wheat bread recipe cause' I would rather make my own than get store bought too. Thanks again.
lol I love the ending for me my husband loves homemade bread and well I know my recipe by heart but I love this video.
thank you for make me laughing
Jenny, I love your videos, you seem to always make me giggle! Btw, it shouldn't matter if the shiny side or the dull side of the foil is covering. Aluminum is aluminum and it has the same heat transference between its atoms and the melting point of aluminum will always remain the same. The foil is only dull on one side and shiny on the other because of the process of making foil by the manufacturer. But you can experiment though to see if I am wrong!
Hi,            I tried it and the outcome was awesome ! But I have a question: It took about an hour for the dough to rise instead of 35 min. What's the reason ? Is it because it is winter time here and the kitchen is cold ?  Another question, is it possible to bake this load using white flour only ? will I get the same result ?  Shad
Add that bread to  this guy...adorable !
Thanks for taking the fear out of yeast bread. Would love to see a video on whole wheat oatmeal bread.
where dat Jenny Jones show at? LOL I miss this crazy woman. PS...excellent recipe and wonderful loaf. Tried it last night.
Jenny I remember you so many years ago on those talk shows.  Good to see you have this channel now.  I think this is one of your true callings in life: teaching.  You are a natural teacher.  It shows in your eyes and body language and voice. (whew!)
humor.:')
QUESTION:  Have you ever doubled this recipe?  I'd love to try it (big family!) but I don't want to "ruin" all the ingredients if it doesn't translate well to doubling :-)
EXCELLENT!  I am not a good cook.  And even I wasn't able to ruin this bread.  PERFECT and worked EXACTLY as described.  My food usually looks like a "pinterest fail."  But not this time.  I made the bread with my hyperactive 11-year-old son, and he loved using the mixer and kneading, and the "instant" gratification of the bread being done so soon.   If you are not a baker, try this recipe.  You will not be disappointed.  Also, I used the two "regular" attachments on my mixer--I didn't have the dough paddle she did.  And that was not a problem.  (NOTE: I used fresh yeast that I bought at the store the same day.  This may be a good thing to do.)
Who's your daddy?  Too much fun in the kitchen!
Love making bread... Especially exotic artisan.
is it ok if i don't add egg?
this video was great , it works perfect , i made a great whole wheat bread, and thank to you , great job
ROFL!! LUV YOU!!! MADE MY DAY!!
I `love U greast
why didn't you wake up the yeast first?
omgoodness just realized who you were love the bread ty
Thank you Thank you Jenny ! I followed your recipe exactly this afternoon and the bread is gorgeous - a bit nutty and a tiny bit sweet. I can't believe how light and fluffy it is. The only hitch was the timing of the rise. My kitchen is about 58 f, so I tried the recommendation from your website to put it in the microwave with a cup of boiling water. It worked great, but required an extra 30 minutes to rise. It really tastes delicious! It's so simple, quick, and economical, I can't see buying bread anymore.
I love the vibrant colors in your kitchen, I love the way you delivered this recipe, I love your sense of humor, I love your little mixer timer. you're someone anybody would love to listen to. Thanks for showing me how to make whole wheat bread. I will definitely try it.👍
Your toooo cute :)
whose your daddy? lol
This is the first time I'm baking bread. I followed your steps but the dough seems a bit dry (doesn't look as sticky as yours) would it still turn out good? Any tips to fix it?

Hi Jenny, thank you for this excellent recipe! I make this bread all the time and it never fails :)
This girl has some sense of humor
Спасибо вам боьшое. я смотрю все ваши видео, мне очень  приятно смотреть и слушать.
Thank you fr share, Nice
3:56 "Who's your Daddy?"
Wait a minute, I remember you. Your Jenny from your talk show on TV. Ladies and gentleman if you think she can cook you should see her drum. Yes , Jenny can jam on a 9 piece pretty damn good. I remember seeing you tear it up on TV many years ago....hah!!! This is awesome.
I'm no Baker but I could tackle that one, Nice Loaf.
whos ur daddy
I ran into you whilst looking for quick yeast bread recipes tonight...I remember you!...from Television...was it twenty years ago?...Can't remember...lol...I used to watch you all the time...am I right?...anyways, I am making your bread tonight...it is rising right now...I used to make yeast bread when my son was growing up, for him all the time...after he left, I lost interest in some things...this, being one of them...I remember making a yeast bread somewhat similar to this one...but, lost the recipe a long time ago...Thankyou for giving us a little of your gifting...here on YouTube...Blessings, Layna in Vancouver.
7:02 I KNEW SHE WAS A MENTAL CASE!!  JUST KIDDING... LOVE YOU, JENNY!!! YOU ARE GETTING ME BACK IN THE KITCHEN IN A MUCH HEALTHIER WAY.  THANK YOU!
nooooooooooo
thanks Jenny
is it possible to replace olive oil with butter? :)
Haha! You're adorable in this video! Thanks for the recipient and laughs,
Best cooking/baking video I've seen on YT.  You should have your own show!
Hi, it is ok to use everything white flour I'm out wheat flour. thank you
hi. tried ur bread. it was out of this world. so soft and so tasty. Just want a quick guide. if I want to add some flax seeds and sunflower seeds should I reduce the flour quantity or what shud be the ratio.  thx
can 8 make it in a microwave.
From an old time retired chef, the 10 minute "REST" is a short rise period so the bread has 2 rises.
Hi. Made this recipe today. It was wonderful. I make all my bread...done it for 30+ years...still learn new stuff everyday. Thanks Jenny. ChachaDave.
Very nice video. Thanks Jenny.
OMG!!!  Se ve delicioso!!! Gracias por todas tus recetas, eres la mejor!!! Saludos desde Perú ;)
Is it okay not to add egg?? For those who are vegetarians?? Any alternate ingredient??
Mrs. Jenny,   Thank you for your recipe!!   Two questions: How do you store the bread to maintain freshness?  How long will it keep?
Nice one! Can all bread flour be used instead of whole wheat?
Haha love your ending, thanks for great turtorial :D
being learning disabled its hard for me to remember lots of ingredence but  since watching quite a few of your videos i have been able to commit quite a few to memory and its awsome
So it's the egg that allows you to do this without having it be necessary to rise for 18 hours (like some bread recipes I've seen)?
Without the oil, I would say yes, the yeast needs the sugar to eat, this causes the bread to rise, I'm interested now to find other recipes that don't require sugar. I know in wine making raisins work to feed the yeast, wonder how that would work in bread. I'll do some research!
could we make this without sugar and oil? trying to loose weight :(
WHO'S YOUR DADDY
Wahahaha
lmao at cracking the egg love your colorful kitchen just like your personality
can you double this if you have a larger pan?
love your simple and easy bread dough recipe you made me laugh today thank you
love your simple and easy bread dough recipe you made me laugh today thank you
lol. I can't wait to try this bread.
Good!
you're a bit sexy you are
Fabulous recipe. Easy to follow with great results.  Thank you so much.
Can I use this recipe for white bread as well? Can I substitute the whole wheat flour with bread flour? Just want to know if that is a possibility. I never made bread before.
you are so adorable and funny. Jenny I used to watch your show when I was a young adult. am so happy that you have a channel on you tube. love you xoxo
Hi Jenny I made your wheat bread and it turned out wonderful ! This was the first time I have ever made anything that used yeast so new to me. Your video was fun and made it seem so easy that I had to try it. Thanks Jenny and I am going to check out some of your other videos and see what else you make me feel like I can make.
как жаль что не написана рецептура,  красивое видио спасибо вам.
You are a funny naughty lady!! Love this spirit with the food!!! You cracked me with spanking the dough!!! hahahahaha I had to subscribe!!! That's the way aha aha I like it, aha aha! :D Great! heheheheheehehe
'who's yr daddy?'----omg woman!!
can you substitute almond or soy milk for dairy milk?
This is a great recipe Jenny! I made this bread this morning and it's delicious. I made the dough the night before and let it rise for about an hour before placing it in the fridge overnight. I rolled it around this morning until it formed into a small loaf and let it rest covered for about 40 minutes. Baked it at 375d for more than a half hour. Makes a small loaf with a wonderful crumb. Thanks Jenny!
good one at the end.. lol
lol  your a crack up Jenny lol nice loaf a bread by the way........Oooooh i like your spatchelors too.......OH i cant spell forgive me.......Nice colors too......we can't get them in Australia :( can you send me some please :)
Like that ending... keep Cooking Jenny :)
I was hoping to see Jenny slice the bread so we could see the texture. Must try this.
Gave up making bread several years ago, but I'm trying my hand at it again with this recipe. I'm waiting on the 35 minute rise, so we'll see how it goes from there! So far so good though! :)
Hi Ms Jenny, could you maybe also make home made 'Ezikiel bread'? It would be nice to see how it is done.
Did your recipe yesterday with out stand mixer. IT's perfect! I couldn't believe i just made that! Thanks for the recipe Jenny!
OMG, your baking tools are soo colorful, love your cook... my auntie tried to make a bread and it turned really not good, I can still taste the dough.. have you any idea whats's wrong with it?
She's so randy!!!
This is the first video I'm watching and already subscribed! Loved this recipe it was easy and tasty!
I'm gonna give this a try. I hope I don't end up with another whole wheat brick! :)
You crack me up! Great cook & funny to boot. I've never made a satisfactory load of whole wheat bread. You make it look so easy. I'll have to give your recipe & method a try. Love your colorful tools! Thanks for the video.
Thank you so much for the recipe Jenny! Its our favorite and I make it almost twice a week! The only thing is that it gets a little dry and crumbs fall when applying butter. What am doing wrong? Thank you !
jenny.           I have an allergy to eggs can I substitute the egg with something else?
jenny.           I have an allergy to eggs can I substitute the egg with something else?
LOL! Jenny you goof!   Thanks for the recipe, it looks good. Does it have to be wheat bread? Can you use AP flour?
Jenny,I have almost drove my self crazy trying to make whole wheat bread . Your's are just like the stores. I love it. Thank you, Thank you .
Lady you are too funny. I am going to try out your recipe. I will be watching more of your vids thanks for the good time. WHOSE YOUR DADDY LOL.   Cooking made fun.
I just made this bread following your recipe and it came out great!  My most finicky eater loves it - she's a seven year old with a love for hot dogs.  No more store bought bread for this family, thanks!
Hi jenny, I did it!! ans it was the easiest loaf of bread I ever baked!!!  thanks, your the greatest!!
That looks like really good bread. Can you make it into rolls?
Oh my gosh I love her so much! No surprises!
very love your amazing and simple recipe .thank you for sharing the bread cooking and your good smile
Jenny, did you bake that loaf on the bottom rack? It looks like that's where you put it. Maybe just the camera angle. Ted
jenny, i just love your recipes . they are so simple and easy to make. I love the way anchor the show.
I understand your spatula obsession.
I made this on Saturday.  My kids (ages 11, 8, 3 and 8 months), my wife and I loved it!  I was glad to find an easy sandwich bread that is almost entirely whole wheat.  Thank you Jenny!
Hi Jenny.....I've made your bread numerous times and it comes out perfect every time!  I absolutely love it !  I'm now making it with multi-grain flour and it works well too.  Thank  you so much for sharing this and all of your recipes with us....you're the best!        Trudy
Hahahahahahaha! You have earned a new subscriber!!!
I plan to try this recipe, but my comment is regarding your sense of humor!  I laugh every time I watch one of your videos.  You make cooking and baking fun!  Thanks for the wonderful recipes and the fun, FUN videos!
I love your videos, you seem so happy and funny...BUT...kneading is old school. You tuber Jnullo's friend AJ Prepper is the way to go now. I had never made bread, except as a new bride, a big failure. Now I can make bread and sooooooooo easy. And you have the stand mixer for it. It works. Form into a ball by 5 motions, that's all. No more. When your 79 and a half you let the mixer do it.
love your kitchen and your fashion style! kisses from singapore!
Hey part of this video appeared on the YouTubers' react video on the 25 oct
Yummy. ...I love it...
Love your quick recipe and your egg warming hahaha
yes you can just add 1 tbsp. of sugar to activate the yeast. george smith
Amazing !!!!🍞
can we do it without sugar ?
Wow. I followed your directions as well as I could and I must say, The bread I made turned out better what I remember my mom's home-made bread was like. BTW: I've never made bread before In my life. Thank you Jenny Jones, big ups to You.
There shouldn't really be milk in the bread, should it?
Im baking a second loaf right now.  Dziekuje!.  Quick, easy and my picky kids ate it too.
Jenny, you are so funny, again, I wish you were on 'food network' you'd add 'hilarious class' to the network!
Lovely, thank you for sharing
Wonderful
Yay! Did it! Thanks!
amazing guide : )
I don't use aluminum foil, as it is considered to be unhealthy, what can I use instead?
Really Nice! Complete and didactic lesson.  Thank you Chef!
whos your daddy hell yeah make that doe listen lol
We got bread!!!!!! I loved and followed your recipe because it had this nice not too crusty dome on the top. Veganised the recipe by using soymilk and a sub for the egg. I made my own flour from grains and needed much more proofing time. In fact, I wondered: "Whole wheat grain": What does that mean in the US: 100% full grain or is it lightly sifted/ extracted? We have flour types such as 45%, 55%, 80% and 100% here in Switzerland. That's why I was wondering ....
I  learned a lot from this video... I am really bad at making breads... I will try again..
can we make it without milk and oil .
can we make it without milk and oil .
You look familiar. Did you have a TV show before?
Can we use oat flour instead of the whole wheat?
Can you make white bread the same way?  I am going to have a bread baking cass, and I thought about doing a class for white breads and a one for wheat.
Thanks for your answer Jenny! Lots of greetings from The Neterlands. ( We are a bread nation so if you like to have some special recipes, please mail me!
Hi Jenny, ohhhhh myyyy I was looking for a bread recipe and I came across your channel😀  I use to love your TV show! I always felt you genuinely loved people! Now I am going to love your channel. Thank you for teaching me how to make bread.😊❤👍
Hello Jenny, I'm from The Netherlands and we don't uses cups etc to messure the products. Is it possible togive it in grams??? Greetings from Holland ( Europe )
I was looking for a bread recipe n I found u!! JENNY JONES. I used to watch ur talk show when I was younger!! Miss u on tv!! Ur so funny. "Who's your daddy"😂 love ur channel
omg you are just hilarious💖 i stopped watching all other channels since i found yours! loved your recipe and am on my way to make it NOW!
Pretty funny!
great recipe. you are beautiful n funny lady, glad i ran into your videos :)
If I forget about the egg I just put it in a cup of tepid water for 10 minutes or so. And I ALWAYS forget about the egg!  :-)
Your channel is the funniest and easiest one for cooking :) Thank you for the recipes and all ;) xoxo from Istanbul,Turkey :)
Hi Jenny, I don't have a thermometer to measure the milk's temperature (120 F), so can I use a microwave instead? If so, how many seconds should I microwave to reach 120 F degrees? Thank you!
Jan, I have a problem with my bread. Let me explain the problem my wife likes to  keep the house tremp. at 72 deg. I put my bread to rise on the porch, and it rises 2 or 3 inches above the ban covered with a towel.  I heat the over to temp. it's 12 feet from the porch to oven.  No mater now fast I try to get it in the oven it still falls level with top  ov the pan.  DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM!
Did this today and it came out great!
Hi, Can we use honey instead of sugar.. if so how many tbsp do i need to use for 2 cups of whole wheat flour?
I noticed you did not put on any egg wash on the bread before you put it in the oven, is it because it's wheat bread and not white?
Oh my! LOL You are hilarious!
Every professional baker use cold water, cause of the frictionheat you get from the machine. its a thumbrule that every minute adds 1 degree celcius and the perfect dough is 24 celcius. The cold water is because you want to mix it so the gluten gets strong and that is the secret of making a good and fluffy bread.  Not this egg/milk/sugar unhealthy bread you made.  If you want to accept that you have a bad bread, i can give you a artisan bread for you to try.
so many strange things here. Sugar, egg, warm milk... Your making bread, not a cake... beides your using the wrong equipment for breadmaking, you dont use a grind, you use a bread hook. maybe you can make dinner, but not bread.
who's your daddy lol
U r so funny;) thank u for a wonderful vid!
who's your daddy... lmao
Thank you Jenny, I will definitely try this loaf and it looks good. I do bake my own bread from time to time.   I think you are so jolly and I love your kitchen and all of the colourful spatulas.  You are a feel good person. best wishes Ann in South Australia.
Hi Jenny. I tried your recipe..The bread came out very tasty. I also made a loaf, substituted soy milk for cow's milk, that too tasted really good.. Thanks Jenny.
How to cut even slices out of the bread?
I made this Bread 2 times already and I love it. The  only thing what I did different was Coconut oil! I love the bread my son he is 6 he loves it too. The No Knead  Bread will be next I try to bake. Thank you so much for your Channel !

Omg what a lovley lady you are <3 I just came across your channel. I just made this bread I hate American Bread so I bake since 5 Years my own bread but I needed a new recipe. Got tired of my bread :D I used Coconutoil I see how that comes out. Can't wait til tomorrow Morning to have a slice with my homemade Blackberry jelly. I'll let you know how it was. Have a good day Mrs Jenny
Jenny, how can I thank you enough for this recipe?  I have struggled with whole wheat bread to get it to resemble store bought texture.  You have the best recipe ever!  The bread turned out so perfect, I feel like a super star baker.  Plus it is the fastest and easiest whole wheat bread recipe I have ever tried.  It is amazing!  Again, thank you so much.  BTW, may I enquire as to how you came up with this?  Did you learn it from your Mother or something like that?  :)
omg! I wasnt expcting that u also crack the hell out of me! lol! love ur videos!
who is your daddy!
you remind me so much of my younger ages. watching your shows. I just subbed
you remind me so much of my younger ages. watching your shows. I just subbed
you remind me so much of my younger ages. watching your shows. I just subbed
is this Kenny Jones the host? :) I sort of can remember her voice.:) Brought lord of memories.
Hi Jenny great recipe and awesome presentation and you are so naturally funny hahaha i burst our laughing and subbed ..thank you !!
thanks a lot I made this bread awsome
my was dry, what did I do wrong?
lol spank that dough "who's your daddy?" you're so funny! :-D
I converted this to a bread machine recipe & it turned out great. The next time I put 3 kinds of seeds into the "additions dispenser" & it also turned out great. What it did change was the height of the bread & the density, but it was still delicious. The recipe is a keeper.
Just made this recipe earlier this eve.. using  my Kitchen Aid stand mixer..... love it. Turned out perfectly... ,  lovely to make a quick & tasty single loaf of bread..so easily. I used Organic Red Fife Whole Wheat Flour + Organic All purpose Unbleached Flour.. melted organic butter for the oil component... I will be using this recipe often !! Have tried few other recipes from Jenny Can Cook.. all with  great results > Thanks so much.
the last part is funny
Sounds great going to make it tomorrow.
I love the way you cook. It's funny and easy to follow. Thank you for sharing.
you are so cool
Hi. Can i mix some seeds inside this recipe?
Shes so funny😂😂😂 i love you jenny
Did this one today it was great very easy I did forget the 1/4 cup flour at the end but came out very good I would like to add honey to this but not sure.
"you gotta spank that dough who's your daddy?" lol
"Spatula City" .... buy 10 Spatula's and get 1 free!!! I want to try this with Einkorn - it's a  type of wheat but doesn't have the gluten like normal wheat.  I  think it is safe for gluten free people.  Have you ever tried it?  Thank you!
thank you Jenny. I made it and it came out perfect ☺
Was looking for an easy bread recipe and stumbled across your channel. I was tossing and turning pulling my hair out trying to remember who is this girl with that infectious smile suddenly realise that it was the Jenny Jones Show which I watched a lot many years ago. Jenny you haven't aged one bit and still have that sense of humour so I need to sub, loved it.  Can I request a future episode with a run down look at those essential kitchen accessories and utensils you recommend ? All those rainbow colour ones you have looked amazing.
I love the simplicity of this recipe and the colors in your kitchen...I just subscribed and will be trying this recipe soon...also...what's the brand of that aqua colored food scraper on the countertop...?
hahaha lol this woman weaird but ina funny way lol
You make my day!  I put my eggs in warm water to get them to room temp.  You live dangerously!
Jenny: I did follow your recipe to the letter but I couldn't wait for it to cool before tasting, hence the chewy consistency. (Och! it smelled soooo good!) Once cooled it was perfect. Thinly sliced, next day, it made an excellent open faced smoked salmon (Lox) sandwich with some cream cheese, capers, red onion and a whisper of lemon. I enjoyed it for breakfast this morning...makes excellent toast too with my homemade Seville Orange marmalade. Thank you for the butter tip.
LOVE YOUR RECIPES AND YOUR HUMOROUS PRESENTATION! GREAT COMBINATION OF INGREDIENTS! X
Jenny J., cool. Thanks for sharing & great looking bread. Nice.
You're a hoot
Hehe.. You are awesome
She reminds me of Lorraine Bracco!
I love your kitchen!! It's so colourful!!
Overall very nice bread. The crumb is a little more dense and chewy than I like but very tasty nonetheless. I had a problem turning it out of my "non-stick" tin and the bread tore on the bottom. Next time I'll spray oil and possibly flour the pan. I like to give the oven a burst of steam at the start of baking time by quickly throwing half cup of water into pre-heated pan in bottom of oven; gives bread a nice glossy finish.
I tried your recipe. But I found it's very hard to take the bread out of the pan after the baking is done. I've already greased the pan with olive oil before putting the dough in. Do you have any suggestions? Thank you.
oh my god ! such a wonderful recipe!!!!!! although theprocess takes me longer time, cauae I don't have the stand mixer. the final bread came out taste amazing !!!!!!! LOVE your recipe ,thanks for sharing
An Egg and Milk ... hmmm . I was reluctant at first, but I am thrilled at the result .  "Who's yer Daddy ? "
Could I replace the whole wheat flour with all purpose or bread flour for a loaf of white bread instead of whole wheat?
I love your presentation and how simple you make the entire process. Thank you.
haha, love the egg routine. bread looks good too.
I needed to make some bread but I've been dreading it because of the heat, the long kneading times, and my general patience in cooking (or lack there of) since I work at home. I'm picky about my whole wheat bread, and much of the commercial kinds I can't eat because I'm highly allergic to honey. So in short, I wasn't expecting much.  And then I discovered that my husband failed to tell me that he had used the last of the all-purpose flour. Needless to say I wasn't happy. Being out of options I replaced the AP flour with whole wheat and whisked in 1/4 c. vital wheat gluten before proceeded with the recipe. Once I started mixing the dough, I realized that I should have waited to put the other 1/2 c. WW flour in as it quickly formed a ball. The rest of the process went on without any more unexpected deviations. I have to say I'm in love with the minimal kneading, something my wrists really appreciate.  Once the bread came out of the oven it looked PERFECT! I couldn't believe it was even soft on top after I was bracing myself for another thick crusted wheat bread (that ends up feeling like eating shrapnel.) The best part is I didn't feel trapped in the kitchen and I was able to have homemade bread done for my husband's lunch before he left for work. This recipe is so easy to make that it really should be the first bread recipe someone should learn. My mom taught me to make bread when I was in grade school and now I'm in my late 30s. THIS is my new favorite bread recipe! No more dragging out the bread machine for gross bread that takes longer, and no more wasted time waiting for the traditional first rise. Thank You!
I have a recipe that says to let rise in the pan until the bread reaches the top of the pan and then bake in an oven that has NOT been preheated. It will continue to rise in the oven and it is great.  :)
Lovely recipe and presentation..... 100
Thumbs.....down I'm a child booo
lol ..Did she just spank it and say who's your daddy? too funny
How long do you have hold the egg?
what did you do with the foil.i couldn't see
This was so simple (and you are so funny!)
Idk don't know, she reminds of Meredith Grey from Grey's Anatomy.
Xcellent recipe Jenny. I don't have a stand mixer so I just kneaded by hand. And I only had the active dry yeast on hand (I think it's not as potent as instant) but it turned out great.
Jenny, once in a month video not enough. I know it's hard work but, you are my T.V. for me which means wants to see you everyday.. love you with respect... Aliaa
Can i add grains and seeds like oats and sunflower seeds etc in it to make it more healthy??
Oh ,lovely lady.. Your kitchen is so colourful. I like it... Dat rooster show pc is also good one....
I so love this, Jenny! You are so adorable and funny! I'd really like to start learning more and more about bread and hopefully get into baking soon. I hope for the day when we no longer need to buy bread, as well.   P.S. I love your spatulas!
In one word...fabulous.
Loved it!
Can I use my bread machine?
hello, can I use all whole wheat flour and omit the all purpose flour? This looks super easy and I cant wait to try it!
That bread look so delicious! What can you substitute for the milk? Can you use soy or almond milk?
Love learning and.watching your videos. Thanks a lor.
Can I substitute the milk for water?
...... haha Jennys a freak ;-) lol jk great video
Interesting! I bet that was an empty egg shell by the sound of the crunchy. Anyway, good job!
Such a quick & easy recipe, just need a loaf tin to get started (unless I do it without?). I need to try this!
Jenny, I've watched this, but to me, this is NOT an "easy" recipe, if you need a mixer, kneading, and a lot of cleaning.  This is why bread machines were invented.
Hello Jenny, Great video and quick. Roughly how much flour did you use in that loaf? That tin you used is that a large loaf or medium. I'm in UK where 800g bread is classed as large. Thanks
I look forward to your videos!!!
you make my day!!! love your videos!!
can you provide nutritional info for your recipes thanks
The recipe is great, you are great. Love it!
making this   in a few days    its so simple
Great recipe that works every time
nice video.  exactly the right recipe im looking for.  thank you.  Btw, very pretty spatulas
Oh darling, I like your show.  Thank you.
HI Jenny, Thanks for the recipe.I baked the whole wheat bread yesterday using wholemeal flour instead of whole wheat, and it tasted wonderful - soft with nice texture!  Definitely a keeper for me!
Love this! Cannot wait to try it. Thank you!
I love it...can you post the recipe of whole wheat bread...thank you!
Great work Jenny
Hi, can it be made without egg?
Professor Umbridge!
Thanks Jenny…remember you from back in the day. Love you!
Im in love with ur channel Jenny.... Tks for sharing ur recipes... Greetings from Brazil :)  1000000000000000000 of thumbs up (y)
"Gotta spank that bread... Who's your daddy?!" God that made me laugh.
Thx Jenny! I always wondered how hard it would 've beento make bread. Now I know it's super fun and easy!!
Followed this for my first attempt at a homemade bread and it's looking good.  Thanks for such a detailed tutorial.
I love this recipe. I made it with Dried Cranberries and Cinnamon it came out perfect.I have one in the oven right now rising thank you for all the great recipes.
great video! :)
Lol she put the egg in her bra lol
keep up with the funny stuff. I wasn't expecting it. I remember you from when I was a kid.
Don't make me use my special spatula, Who's your daddy?
You are too funny! That last part with the egg. 😁 So want to try thus recipe! Who needs store bought (fake) bread 😛. Well, for the most part fake. Anyway. THANKS JENNY! and I LOVE your colorful utensils!!!
I bought the regular yeast, so how many cups of water should I use? Do I have to use less flour and milk?
How often do you do videos? Once a week I  look to see if there is a new one... But there usually isn't.
to be fair, your recipe is very good as well as your instructions...except for the coating part.  I was just frustrated as this was the second loaf that did not work.  Yours would have worked if I had gone with my instincts and coated the pan with butter and flour.  Thanks for posting Jenny.
One BIG flaw about your method is that you should ALWAYS coat your pan with oil/butter and flour.  You made me waste 90 minutes and 50Cents worth of ingredients as the loaf stuck to a pan that is identical to the one you used.  I was going on your recommendation that you didn't have to do this...utter nonsense!
Today is the first day of summer. Jenny, you can cook. But can you GRILL? Or will it be a "cruel, cruel summer"?  I know, go to a website that has a grill chef. :)
you are so funny .. :)
I like your recipe
hahaha... you are funny.  Like your recipes thank you.
Who's your daddy?
3:57-3:59 Who's your daddy! LOL!
Ur on @eboala's instagram
spank dat dough b
Who's your daddy😂
My first Jenny Can Cook watch...LOVE IT!  Love the bright colors, HD with apt filmaker/editor, brief and FUNNY!  I did subscribe and will make this bread soon.  Thanks and God Bless!
Hi Jenny, I subscribed to your channel after watching just one vid!  You are hilarious and your recipes are simple and easy to execute.
looks awesome!! Need more videos!!! Keep on cooking :)
I tried it on the first attempt it was perfect now i have my mom baking bread too.. thats Jenny u little freak..
Hello I love your videos but may I suggest a simple intro and maybe some background music? :) Its only a suggestion keep doing you
I love her so much LMAO
You are so cool
I am so done you are killing me.   That whole wheat bread is the life though !!!
love the recipe....n i love to try.......*need beginner luck....^^
So many folks want exact instructions and I've learned there's no such thing. Cooking and baking is the art of adjustment. You're funny, and what are you gonna do with all those spatulas?
Your all America loves
Can we do this with out using egg? Pl let me know
Well, I'm admitting defeat.  I've tried this twice, same result, bread won't rise.  All ingredients are new.  The only difference is I used Almond milk, not cows milk.  My second-attempt 'loaf' is in the pan trying to rise -- over 55 minutes as I write this.  It's not nice & smooth like Jenny's -- mine looks like a scarred acne face.  I don't have a fancy $330 mixer like Jenny's, so I used my Cuisinart food processor -- makes a heck of a mess.  This second time I kneaded the heck out of it -- it seemed to still want more flour as it stuck to my hands.  What to do?  Back to my Breadmakers?  (yeah I've got 2)  Please help.  Not sure what to do.  I cannot use cow's milk due to allergies.
😂u e so funny by the way , great bread and great vid as usual :)
Dear Jenny, I've been doing your bread recipe since you posted it twice-three times a week and it is always a huge success! Thank you so much! Hope you come back soon with new recipes. Wishing all the best! Love your channel. You are great! <3
Yo this lady is effin HILARIOUS!

÷good video, loved it, if I don't use the eggs, sugar and the olive oil which I avoid, am I going to have the same result?
Hi Jenny, I just made this bread, it came out great!! I'm so happy I found your utube page, I have subscribed to your website and added my pic's. more video's please, love, Lynne x
Yeah, great recipe! Thank you for sharing.  I ended up using coconut oil, i was out of butter.  Now that we have finished eating our loaf, it tastes good too!
Hello Jenny! First of all thanks for all the wonderful videos that you make. Highly informative and very well produced..... I have a question for you; I recently bought a 5x10 loaf pan 3 inches high and I cannot find an exact recipe or information of the ingredients measurements that I would need to make whole wheat bread on this particular loaf pan. Could you help me figure it out.  Thanks Jenny  Best Regards
You should make a cheesecake video
OMG...the Clevage was too funny...cracked me up...then you pounded your chest...laugh my butt off....OK I will have to try your recipe...looks awesome.
Where did you find that adorable kitchen timer that looks like the big mixer? I love it!
lease , someone could write the recipe , because I'm Brazilian and not understand what is being spoken , I am using the traducao of simultaneous text to write at the time , since already grateful .
Превод наБялгарски
Yes! Success, finally a bread recipe that works in my kitchen. Thank you for sharing. I used coconut oil- out of olive oil
Who came from vine?
Thank you for making such useful videos! But sometime when you are showing something and it is moving, it is difficult to see because of banding across the image. Please check your settings to get rid of the interlacing, and keep making useful cooking videos! :)
Hahahh so gonna try this
Hi Jenny.  I tried this recipe but my bread doesn't rise 1 inch above the pan (9*5). You mention 7g of yeast but you said use the whole packet which is 21g. So I used the same brand of newly brought yeast (21g) today. I kneaded by hand,  but it still didn't rise. I let it rest for 6 hours. What am I doing wrong?  Please advice.
hello mam can you pls tell me the ingredients in grams and milk in litre that you usedl  thnks
Jenny...where did you get those colorful spatulas? Especially the purple one.
This lady is a sweetie
Omg " Whos your daddy" hahahaha
Looks great.
spank that dough
LOL, "WHo's your daddy!?"
OMG!!! This looks GORGEOUS!!!! Thank you for your time. I'll be baking it as soon as posible. GBY :)
Hi Jenny I tried your recipe ..the bread came out beautiful...but it stuck in the pan!
love love love your tea towel   and cant wait to make this recipe  :)
Jenny, You have made my day, my month!!!! I almost fell of my chair finding your cooking videos today! I remember you from your talk show times...back when... ...with my little daughter we watched you religiously.. anyway.... Jestes Super Dziewczyna!!!!
That ending!!! I cracked up. I just made this bread while watching the video and it tastes really good ! Thank you for sharing this with us.
I'm not sure if that extra cup of all purpose flour was used in the recipe, or just the small portion you sprinkled in and the remaining used to flour the board...?
I love watching u, thanks for the vids !!! Oh.... and the baking is good too !
hi Jenny,  I just  love you so much!!!  You are so entertaining and know what you're doing which is a wonderful asset....thank you so much for all your lessons.  By the way, I love, love, love your kitchen!!!
thks Jenny beautiful bread I also make my own bread for many years now therapy for me lol
Jenny, you crack me up!!!!
Another great video.  Looks good.
when did you get the mixer . i have been following you doing it the hard way . but i like the way, you crack an egg  kiwi bob
where do you get all your colorful baking items? Gorgeous. Making the Bread right now and it smells wonderful:) thank you.....  By the way lol I kept thinking gosh do I know this lady in real life? I have seen her and know her voice,  It took me days to figure it all out.
Amazing video , you always bring a smile to my face Jenny , keep up the good work  ;-)
LOL, Jenny your nuts, and you know "Eggsactly" what I'm talking about!  :-)
what happened to your live tv show
I think you are so lovely hahah
Oh my goodness Jenny! I laughed so hard on your outro!   LOVE your videos!
1, 2, 3...8, 9, 10. Good. Jenny's got all her fingers and none ended up in the bread. :)
Another bleepload of spatulas from SPATULAS-R-US.
You're so hilarious...lol. That was a gorgeous loaf of bread, thanks for all you do=).
Can't wait to try this! I love the color of your mixer :)
Hi Jenny,  How wonderful to have happened to come across you.  It's wonderful to see you again!  ((Hugs)) from Michigan   :)
Hi jenny can you please do an in-depth video about the basic flours such as AP flour, whole wheat, bread flour ect.  And talk about how and when to use them .  Thank you
LOL I love your videos!!  and can't wait to make some bread :-)
Love ur videos...great stuff!!!
Jenny  I really like your recipes and have made many of them. I must ask you, however, what's the hurry on your bread? Your recipe is very similar to my own whole wheat, but I believe that by taking the time to allow it two full rises, the flavor is even better.
I am impressed,  how about if I make it white bread, can i use the all purpose flour or other kind of flour? will it be the same texture?
Jenny, you're a hoot!  There's nothing like fresh bread baking in the oven. Thanks for the quick recipe!
Thanks Jenny, I am a 65 year old man just learning to cook, thanks to your videos. One quick question, can the bread be sliced to make sandwiches?   ps: I made your meat loaf, it was so damn good ......!!!
You're fantastic!
Thank you for this..  loks deelicious!!!
You are so enjoyable to watch and I love your recipes. You cracked me up!
I love your videos
