Hello Neha, Had a question about your otherwise excellent recipe. When I heat the fresh cream it becomes liquidy and not thick like how yours is becoming. Is there a special kind of cream that you're using?

My 3 and half years old son loved Ur video.... I downloaded it... Everyday my son used to play the video atleast 10 times n show this to me smiling... I literally used to bake this cake everyday for him.... Thanks again... This recipe is priceless for me...  It reminds me of my lil boy...🙏🤗😊.. he is no more now, but during his last few months, this was the only food he liked n made this for him almost everyday...
The cake turned out as if I made a chocolate pudding ... Jelly type ... Honestly I didn't like it
The recipe is really good.I tried it for my own bday (lockdown times)
Hi Neha. Is it fine if I use a 7 inch baking pan?
Can you please tell that the white cream which you used was fresh cream or chocolate for that design?
Hi neha,I tried this,I didn't refrigerate my cake after making for three hours is it a must ,and after making I put it in the fridge coz the chocolate start melting for the heat is it ok,it is not moist as real cake it is little bit sticky in mouth ,what did I do wrong?

Best chocolate cake ever
I followed every step with correct measurements. The ganache part was good but the cake became so rubbery and tasteless.
Wow beautiful cake😋
I can't understand the measurements...can u plz tell me the details measurements..ex.. 1 cup = ? Gm ..like this...
Wow!! Look At The Decorations On The Cake 🎂.  So Beautiful And Kool And The Cake Itself.....  Keep The Videos... 📹.
For this spider web design you are using only fresh cream? Can we use melted white chocolate also Nice recipe😊
NOTE: I’d just like to point out that turn off the stove after the fresh cream has heated up, and ONLY THEN add in your chocolate. You don’t want to put in the chocolate with the flame on or the chocolate can burn.  The pan I have used has a diameter of slightly less than 9 inches. If you want to make it easier to cut the cake in two layers, you can use an 8 inch pan. Make sure it is deep enough as the cake will rise while baking. And baking time may vary depending on your oven. My new oven bakes the cake in 25 minutes so keep a check on your cake.
did you actually heat the chocolate on direct flame?
What will be the kilogram of this cake?
Hi plz tell me which dark chocolate u are using?

Mouthwatering 😋
That is some thick cream.  Gorgeous cake!
Looking so yummy
why do you say cacke?
local gas stove look very nice
what a bhgola
The top looks wonderfully fancy.  I hope it truly is moist and dense and heavy.  I like that coffee is included in the ingredients.  It enhances the dark chocolate flavor.  If I attempt this recipe I will omit the chocolate chips or use only dark chips or perhaps leave them out.  It looks beautiful just with the top ganache.  I may just not ganache the side.  The elaborate top decoration is more than enough.  Less is more!  It looks elegant!  WONDERFUL video!!!
how did you the prepare the buttermilk?
If i used milk insted of butter milk would it be bad
Beautiful
