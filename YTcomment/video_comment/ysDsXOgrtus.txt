You are truly gifted. I literally just bought a prize wheel from Amazon. Came here today to find fun games to use with it. Searched for games and your video came up. I decided to watch. That wheel came out beautiful.
Very cool
Thank you for creating this video, going to make one this week for our fundraiser !  Question, the pop bottle connecting the arrowhead to the bases that's bumped out so it's in line with the painted screws, is that plastic glued in ? I saw you tap it in but do you think it's sturdy enough for all of the spins to come ? Hoping you still get alerts for this video !
Thanks for the video, are all of yours sped up like this?  No offence but I rather the woodworking slowed down a bit, the mechanics of pouring a coke does not elude me.  Most of all thank you for all the info, I am new to woodworking and learn much.
what is the diameter of the spinning wheel?
Amazing ❤
Thank you for this video. I made one this weekend. Super easy and you did a great job showing what to do and explaining.
OK, taking my chances here. I do see this video was posted six years ago however I was curious of the sides of wood round that you use. I love the ginormous creativity and it looks so amazing.
3:14 what is that rotating thing ?
Great Job. Do you have the measurements for this project?
Dude I'm sorry I couldn't even make it 3 minutes in with that music love the work you do just can't take that music
how would a wheel decide what space to land on
Como se llama el rodamiento que hace girar a la ruleta...?
Hello, can you please advise what the name of the spinning center piece is you used? I can't seem to find one like that at all. Thanks.
a
How how for one?
Do you offer to sell any of these?
Excelente trabajo 👍 desde Colombia
Sir I also want same how much will you charge for same type of lucky wheel?
Where is the construction of spinning mechanism?
ditto
How do you keep the wheel from wobbling?
This is exactly the video I was looking for. Thanks.
i also love soda and woodworking !
What’s the song at 6:30
Simply the best!
Very cool! Thanks!
Spinner has 3 circles with one broken down
If you’re here looking for a helpful vid to offer tips or tricks on making a prize wheel, or to see the process behind this one- I’d save the time and find a different vid.  If this was supposed to be instructional it failed. There’s only loud, obnoxious music over top of loud shop sounds. No explanations, and any talking is during sped up working segments so. Spends forever making paper templates to mount the lazy susan for seemingly no rational purpose considering you could have placed the lazy susan on the board and then marked the hole location. This was an absolute mess 🫢🫣
anyone else dancing to this fire beat

What is the name of the machine you used at minute 7:52 to 7:57?
What would b the price for the same ?
Your extremely talented🙌🏾🔥
I love it 👏🏾👏🏾😂more coke breaks🤣🤣
what was the clear material you used between the two pieces of the clicker thing?
Excellent video, thank you!
Awe inspiring skills Wood n stuff. Where is this wheel now, is it still in use? xx
Nice … I can’t afford those tools and have a tenth of the space to work. But it’s cool seeing it done.
Well done 👍 sponsored by Coca cola?
what do you charge to make a smaller spinning wheel  with 10 spots that will spin more freely than your big one?
12:38 - 13:07 - 13:08
Five years late to the party, but I got here in search of how to make a prize spinner. I most definitely do not have the skills or the equipment to make one, so I'll likely have to commission this in the future. In the meantime, I'll have to make do with paper/cardboard spinners to use in my English classes :P
BTW your work is Awesome!!!
I Love it!!! I am going to make a Spinning Wheel of Death prop for my Halloween display, put a large doll in the middle with flaming knives around her and get a motor to make it spin. THE LAZY SUSAN That was All I needed to see, I couldn’t figure it out until I saw this video  THANK YOU!!!!
This is by far the nicest wheel I've ever seen! Seriously amazing job!
hey man great video! better take it easy on the coke brother lol
I want one for my classroom do you ever sell them?
Do you have link to new bearings you ordered?
Very inspiring work!
Nice design!
Hi, I'm 4 years late to the party lol. Was wondering though, I'm trying to make a budget version of this (6 mm MDF instead of plywood). Can I use the bearing of a cheap fidget spinner instead? I'm worried it can't take the weight.   Would love to hear your opinion on this! 😁
Hey Steve, great video! I built a large wheel with the lazy susan hardware. I was wondering if you had any specs on how to use  the flange-style bearings instead. I have run 3 contests with the wheel so far and it works great.
Good work!
Wow!!!  This is amazing.  I've wanted to built a prize wheel for a while, and most of the tutorials I find are for wheels that are small or lame.  Yours is so good!  Mine won't be quite so big, but I got a lot of ideas seeing how you made yours!  Thank you!
What type of paint did you use?
Great Editing!  Entertaining!
That looks awesome
What was the total cost of materials?
I came to learn something and was entertained in the process. Great video, I really enjoyed it.
ami peyesi prizes.kintu nibo ki vabe.please help me?MOB:01756283089.Bangladesh.
Hi Steve. Enjoyed this video, thanks! Quick question - what do you call the piece of hardware you used with the bearings in the centre? Im building my own and trying to track something similar down. Cheers, Dan (UK)
What is the bearing he is using ?????? could not understand
Great stuff! Do you happen to have measurements for something like this?
Would u consider building one for me? I'll pay you.
Awesome video super creative, thanks for sharing the process

Hi friend, can you pass me the measurements that you used to make your roulette?
Kapan dan bagaimans caranya saya dapat menerima hadiah hp untuk saya?
Hi! I know this video is quite old. But would you consider making me one of these?
Wish I could buy it!
Good idea with the lazy susan and the template to find the center. I'm planning on just using a 1/2" steel shaft for my center. But I may switch now.
Thank you. Hope to make one.
Hello interested in purchasing
great job ! do you make them and sell ? need one for Halloween this year
really enjoyed the video although I won't be trying this unfortunately it's too advanced for me
Good job... I wouldve saved time and gone to a craft store for the numbers though!!!
Hella fun!!!  Great video/great project!!!
Beautiful wheel and great video editing...you are an artist, sir. Much respect!
Where I get metal bearing frame please
How much to make a prize wheel, I want one.
Well Steve gotta say my wife and I are both fans now, this was beautifully done and you make it simply informative and fun, you've got two gifts, how make quality and how to teach. Thank you
*That is so freaking cool!!!*
Steve can i order one fr you i would like you build me one
Do you have accurate materials?
Nice job! Is there any way to make it spin faster and smoother?? Not using a lazy Susan?
How do you get the equal triangles on the wheel? I need a method please help
Will a heavier wheel make it spin for a longer amount of time? like a roulette wheel?
That is waaaaaay to much work for me.  But nice craftsmanship.
I came here because I am looking to make a prize wheel for booths at comic conventions for our (The Finest G.I. Joe costuming club) charity K9s for Warriors ... and I could not look away.  Well done video sir.
I'd love to buy one just like this! What are the chances of purchasing a custom wheel like this from you?
I mounted a lazy susan to my project, (using a round one with the weigh capacity) with lighter MDF board but it simply does not spin fast enough and is loud...it is way too slow for a colour wheel project...any ideas please?  Thank you!
great video! what's the name of the thing you used to make it spin??
You are my new favorite sight.  Can hardly wait to play in the shop.  Where did you get all the handy tools for sanding, wood pushers and any other neat things to have? Jan.
A few seconds w/ a heat gun will shrink your pointer plastic down nice and tight.
Making one of these with, hand tools and v.basic wood skills. Thanks for some tips, ie the painting with the paper and the pointer aswell. Also great video, easy watching.
Can these be done for horizontal wheels?
Congrats! the amount of work needed to render that video most have been considerable!!!wow
Very Cool
You done a great job making this prize wheel; love the video and special effects!!!
This looks well good i am stuck with a paper / cardboard one xD
Hey man, I stumbled across your video as I was looking around for some DIY instructions for a spinning wheel I could make for a drinking game. Now I'm definitely not gonna be making this for myself as I'm not as skilled as you nor have the tools you do but I still really really enjoyed watching your video, there's something extremely therapeutic and satisfying in watching you work. The end result was amazing! Keep up the good work!
nice vid. I made a prize wheel last year out of acrylic so we could have some sort of a white board aspect to it, change what the categories were every so often. The spinning on this wheel seems like it locks up quickly, is that because of the flapper or the lazy susan? I ended up using a half threaded hex bolt with some nuts and washers and that worked out pretty good.
very creative!
how much weight can a Lazy Susan bearing hold vertically??
I said ho man....  more than 13 min. Of video But it was worth watching the whole video from beginning to end.I laugh a lot with the sound effects, and the most important is that  i learnHow to do it myself Everything is done to perfection .. thanks for uploading this video ...
What a wonderful video. The finished wheel looks PRETTY heavy (3/4" plywood!!!) which, of course, makes the wheel useful and durable. We raise money for Rottweiler rescue (although we rescue other dogs sometimes) and have been talking about creating a prize wheel for our fund raising. I am an artist and like to build things, but making a wheel similar to yours would be a challenge for me because of the question of tools. (I do use a router, for example, but am scared to death of the thing so ONLY use it in a very elaborate router table...and I don't have a table saw.) However I'm thinking I might be able do it using a modified way; but, of course, it wouldn't be nearly as nice as yours. I appreciate seeing how you used the lazy susan mechanism and how you made the pointer thingy. Thank you. I LOVED watching you work!!!
Nice surname.
Proven to help choose a restaurant to go to for lunch
Thanks!!! You give me a great inspiration   https://youtu.be/B8feIlQuw0A
hello.. may I know the name of your base metal spinner which can make your wheel turned well?
Could you tell the name of the font of your letter and numbers? I really like them. Thanks a lot. Berny
Amazing editing!!!!!
I made it with a lever so when you pull the lever down it will spin [on my other channel]
i need one :(
awesome work there ! i love it , planning to make one myself ! thanx for the idea !
where can I go buy one
Do you take orders for making them? How much?
I love your editing and the wheel itself! I plan on making one for my channel but a little more simple.  You gave me some great ideas.   Yours sure is pertty though! Sub'd!!!
I'm trying to make a cardboard one for club game night  any tips n how to get started without workshop tools
FWIW, I used a S6004 RS bearing.  Cheap and easy to find.  I made a bearing pack with 1-1/4 schd. 40 PVC, it was a nice slip fit on the OD.  I captured the bearing by gluing in a piece of pipe then cutting it off flush.  A 3/4" bolt makes a good axle, a couple wraps of tape for centering and a short piece of cast iron pipe for a spacer.   Just some thoughts to get started.  I'm sure you can figure out the details :)
Quick comment that not all lazy Susan bearings will work. Some will only work horizontally and rely on gravity to hold the balls in the race.
very good,
very nice. such skill. luv it!!!
That was amazing! I not only learned how to make a wheel but so many other things about woodworking by watching this video. Thank you!
What kinda wood did u use? Im planning on making one for my dads 2yr fundraiser for american heart association. Def great video
Thank you! I may have one of these to do, coming up! I came out super cool!!
Sweet Jebus that is cool!
I miss the Crazy Canadian...
Steve, what *do* you call that clamp that you used to keep the nails at the same depth?
i am gay for rainbow pride red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and pink
What is the material used for the clear flexible portion of the clicker?
thanks I got the stuff and got 100% on it
About how much would you charge to make another prize wheel? If I could get an estimate that would be great!
your work is cool.
thanks but i don't have the think to make it but its for my project
what do you call the flexible plastic thing used to help the arrow
Brilliant! Craftsmanship on the wheel construction and design, but also your filming and editing. I thoroughly enjoyed this!
I'm assuming you sell your work ? If so any chance you could let me know how much you would charge to make another prize wheel. You do amazing work!
i lost interest in my original intent in watching this video but the music and fast hammering kept me hanging around
just fall in love with your working style  ;) great work great video  who is the producer of video and cameraman .?? all done magnificent  work
!!
love your videos btw
where did you get that clear piece that goes in between the pointer?  and how do you get it to stay in place? is it plexiglass?
Great video!  What did you use for the bearing in the middle of the wheel?
Very nice!! Excellent form and function. Did you also use soda bottle plastic for the pointer hinge, or did you find another source for the "not too rigid/not too soft" action?
Hi do u have a contact number for clients?
Super Art
Was looking for a perfect way to make my prize wheel and found it. Amazing video, great skills. Where can I find the wooden piece of wood to stop the wheel. Is there something I can buy with a spring in it to stop the wheel.
Is it me or is this video sped up
I don't know what the odds of you replying are but ill give it a try. What did you use to secure the wheel that let it spin as well? Great video by the way!
nice :) I need one for my piano students' Christmas Party. LOL :D I was just looking through to see if there was an easy one to make. This is amazing .. nice job. :D
I can't believe this doesn't have a massive amount of views already! Well done!
Could you just make me one for my classroom? :)
Looks Great !!!  Steve. Where did you buy your bearings?
Great build =) And great video =) Many really cool tecniques to learn here =) Thanks for sharing =)
Enjoyed the build. Liked the idea of drilling thru for screw access holes though if one screw is high enough you could rotate and do one screw at a time for your given application. That said I just watched your latest video and see you are changing the bearings. I will stay tuned ;) Love your channel Steve
Cool build, Steve! Can I ask what you use to protect the paint colors?
Another fun day in the shop... You always seem to come up with some method to do things that I would never think of. Good stuff here my brother!
you are aweaome going to give it a go
How magnificently bonkers! Always a treat Steve; thanks for this super project! And what a splendorously eclectic choice of music... Now, where did I put my Zep vinyl?
Nice work Steve ...
That was awesome. There was more than one good pointer in there. Excuse the pun ;)
Beautiful video, Steve!! Ciao. Mauro
There was so much fun stuff on this project Steve! 20+ year old edge banding still works :)  The fonts for the letters and number are perfect. You had me cracking up at so many spots.
Turned out looking awesome Steve. Great job buddy
Awesome Steve, Looks Great !!
Looks great Steve, and very well built! Thank you for sharing, Cheers Harry
Great build. Great vid. Very fun to watch. Good job bud.
Everything about this video is awesome.
I have no need for a prose wheel, but dammit it just looks like fun to build. Nice job Steve
Where could I get one of those nifty tshirts?
very cool.
Very nice build, Steve I bet all those different colors took most of your time, just waiting for the paint to dry. Great video!
Fun project to watch. Love all your techniques you use to make things.
Very Cool Steve, I enjoy your videos.
Thats a nice build. If ever i need a wheel like that, i'll check this vid for reference.   Glad you're back. Been a while. I wasnt able to join the challenge, maybe you could have another round in the future ;)
Kool Build...
Very cool! I could see making this for a school to use in their fund raising fairs! nice work Steve! oh ! and I dig the scull on the scroll saw!
Love it
did Woody enjoy his glass of coke?? it did say 'share with friends' on the bottle HAHAHA
Fantastic project!!
Muy Bueno!! Saludos desde Argentina!!
looks awesome and well built!
Yet another outstanding video. Nice work.
Nice job Steve. I know what its like to build this type of project. I took me some time to build my horse gambling wheel. I made my wheel before I was shooting video of projects. You can check it out on my channel if you'd like. Well done my friend.
Very nicely built, Steve. I can see there was a lot of time and effort went into that.
Very cool design and build Steve!
Great solution on getting all of the numbers positioned the same.
If you wont to learn something come to Steve French...  :-) Really great Work Sir. Greetz from good old Germany
I can not begin to express how much enjoyment i get from your videos. When i see your name in my  new uploads I always get so excited and have a big smile on my face and considering i rarely smile since my mom died 3 months ago, thats saying alot. Thank you so much for taking the time to make these videos and if no one ever says it again just know there is some one out there you dont know, that truly appreciates the work you put in. Thank you again
Nice prize wheel keep up the great work
Thanks Steve I really enjoyed watching this and its as good if not better than any I've seen on the game shows, now you need to think of a way to have Woody do the spinning
Very nice build! The design and colors put me into a very nice gambling mood !:) The only problem i see is that people may be a bit wary of the results, since it doesn't spin long enough to meet the gambling requirements specified in ISO 1313-13.
Awesome prize wheel. Thank for the idea on how to fix mine. I'm missing the little pointer part it broke off. Now I know what to replace it with. Btw love all your videos you are always making cool stuff. Did you ya give Woody's buddy ole pal a name yet?
Nice job on the wheel
Very cool Steve.
Every video from you is a never ending learning experience ...the folding paper template is genius!! Another great video
Lots of interesting techniques in this project, looks like a fun build.
Your techniques are great and I learn a lot from your videos! Great stuff Steve!
Born and raised in VA and use spray paint on a daily basis, so I totally get the issues with humidity.  Love the prize wheel Steve, glad it stopped raining long enough for you to complete it.
Hey Steve!  It looks great...you put a lot of work into that project...   One thought: The lazy susan bearings work best in the horizontal position...your wheel would spin better if you used a bicycle wheel hub or something meant to be vertical.  No offense...just a thought.  Love your vids!
Nice vintage printer paper. I can hear the noise from hell now.
Steve you always have such great production value, and music. Good Show.
I do agree, it did turn out cool. Really looks good and I am looking forward to winning stuff, LOL.
