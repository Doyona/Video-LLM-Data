As a visual learner, the animations really helped me grasp the movements of each piece, thanks! Now off to practice and hopefully not get checkmated in 5 moves.
Who here in 2025
You also can't castle THROUGH check
If a king has no legal moves, if he can't move at all, isn't that a stalemate instead of a checkmate?
Wut about points of the king
I am 72, and I decided to learn chess to play with my grandkids. Thank you

Thank you for teaching me
Can the rook move both horizontally _and_ vertically in one move, like an 'L'? And can a knight move diagonally to the left/right and then right' left (or vice versa) in one move to make a 'V'? Also, can the queen move both diagonally, vertically and diagonally in one move? And can any piece move both backwards and forwards? ♟♖
Am i the only one that vibes to it on replay

This Was made in 2018!
No matter how much I watch this video. I probably won’t remember anything.
Bishop also have 3 points only and not 3.5 i guess
Don't understand why pawns promote to bishop or rooks when you'll definitely choose a Queen over them ...the queen promotion should not exist in my opinion. (Please, tell me if I missed the reason why here.)
bruh I don't know: lol 🤣🤣🤣
Here because of the tate brothers
I am here because of Andrew tate
I am learning but I don’t have the game
Queens have the most movement on the chess board cuz it looks like a kitchen floor
Came here because of Andrew tate XD
Spanish Checkers  looks like a child's game compared to this complicated chess
Very strange that the makers of the us video used a strange Eastern European chess pieces for their video diagrams.
Can your videos really turn me into a pro
Too be honest, the thought randomly came earlier this evening, to download chess and learn the art.
For the first time I understand the Chess game. Amazing!

Bishop is worth 3 not 3,5
thanks
don't the pawns take up spaces from a2 to h2?
I don't own a chess board and I am watching this from the toilet, great video though.
There is a mistake in the audio, you should have said the pawns initially occupy spaces seven and two.  You said seven and one.
Today having a play on my school with chess I try to watch chess on that game but the teacher can't agree watching and I just wanted to learn chess and my cousin 2 cousins play chess 1 cousin got 2th place 2th cousin losed that all ty for reading sorry at grammars thats a mistake btw I'm on other country and there's no queen on my country.
What movie has the word check mate? 😅
😂😂😂😂
4:39 pawns are in A2 to H2, not A1 to H1
My 10 year old taught me to play last night. Well I say taught but I’m in the process of learning. I came here to make sure he was telling me right and he is.
The King isless powerful but the most important in the game.  The King is also the most lazy of all and yet the valuable. He just let his people work for him especially the Queen. 🤣
Okay
Chess my favorite
I love how I’ve been interested in chest like my whole life and the only thing that pushed me over the edge to learn was the queens gambit
i love High school dxd i love chess
No king queen opposite 🤣🤣👑😂😅😉😜
thankyou very very much
tnankyou very very much
When introducing the Rook, you say it cannot jump over other pieces, but at 9:49 you clearly jump over another piece with the Rook, why is this? Can anyone explain?
there's only six pieces. How hard could it be?
How do you move the Knight
Tate brought me here
Plissss ineed this today for my tryouts😭

A friend of mine showed me how to play chess while going against him so that he'll tell me if I make any wrong moves, and it was very helpful. I've downloaded an app to play chess, and then decided to watch some videos on how to play chess. Now I know a little bit of the game, and see if I can get better when I see him this Monday/Tuesday. 😁 Wish me luck!
Thank you

🙂
Not gonna lie, i really thought their gonna introduce the pawns before even starting discussing the OP pieces in the board.
I love chest but my dad allways wins so this was the perfect video for me.
Why did you say it can't jump over pieces but use it to jump over pieces in the casting strategy
You know, I wanted to use this video to begin my probably long and painful journey of learning to play chess but the obnoxiously loud music in the background Is a bit too distracting for me.
Who's here because your teacher don't know how to play😬

Chess is cooooooooooool
1:42 * me hears the rock *    **Raises eyebrow menacingly**
Your mum here after queens gambit
Wait, why does the white pieces go first?….
I play chess on my bus rides to work and it always gets my brain ready for the day also it's fun
F#
For those trying to learn, it's actually easier if you have someone teach you while you play a game. I learned it for the most part after 1 game.
'' alllllriiiiiight you about to learn how to play chesss'
Who's watching this in 2022?
Trying to impress the guy i like.. bruh
This is so hard to learn
How is the Queen the most important piece?😕
Ugh it's like fancy battleship.
THANK YOU SO MUCH BRIGHT SIDE
Chess
Wow dod
You need a degree to learn how to play chess.
Just want to play with my brother and increase my focus
Joy to all who aren’t here because of the Queen’s Gambit series on Netflix.
Im a chess player back then.. I gave up because ineed to focus my career as an architect and now im so happy for the recognition because of the movie Queen Gambit
Para to sa module ko 🙄😭
Who's in rehab and trying to learn this instead of relapsing?
M
My chess rating is 1003
4:19  Bright Side: But the king is unbelievably valuable. If you lose him, you lose the game  Also bright side: The queen is the most important piece  So the king is the most important piece, not the queen. Because if you lose him you lose the game. The queen is 2nd most important. A professional would know that
my crush wanted to play chess so here i am🗿
Excellent 🙏❣
Chess Players
dEtails not datails
That's easy 😀
I’m really late, but is there anyone else here from after watching Code Geass??? I actually doubt anyone is 😟
Just joined chess club with my history teacher at school. Needed to learn the basics.
4:40 The narrator misspeaks, stating that the white pawns are placed on the row of “A1 to H1”.  He meant to say “A2 to H2”.
This made me better at chess
Ima king
I really don't know anything about the game right now
This is wrong when ur talking about points 3:42
Thank you Sir for you I've learnt cube match now I'm very interested in chess.. Really u r a very appreciatable person
I would definetely recommend new players to look for the grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky on Youtube once you've learned how to play and played the game a couple of times, because he explains really well the ideas of chess
My Brother is played expert level of chess game he is only 10 years old and Till now I didn't win with him but I also loveeee so chess I am a champion 😉  He says 🙄
A bisshop is 3 points as well.
I bought chess when I was 5 years old and my father taught me the rules and in my first match against my 16 year old sister I WON  could you believe that!?
I thought Bishops value was 5 like the rook
Nnnnnnn
Ok, what should I do?
After a long
I'm still confused and I have chess to play tomorrow this channel is useless
The king is unbeleiveable proctable....
I am here after naruto! 🙄
Poti

Ht3y5eir
Am I the only one who's getting more confused😓
Ready to be giving Beth Harmon vibes
Thanks, ive been losing forever qhen playing chess with my cousins
To you, the beginner that is reading this comment,this video is extremely complicated, and not suited for you. Try watching other videos, like Triple S Games' video. It's much better than this.
i'am watching this because i wanna see if i have any hidden talent or not
I rather play chess then watch this (I know how to play)
@4:40, a small correction in the voiceover. Pawns are placed at A2 to H2 for the white side :)
not me watching this after watching the queens gambit lol😂
Was awesome, thanks
Here so i can play andrea botez 😩😩
Wow! This video is great. Especially for beginners who really want to learn faster.  All thanks to  bright side. Well done!
What happens when the king dies
I love the thinking part. It helps organize and choose a play that’s not as risky. I need to learn.
Great beginners instructions, I like how your voice is and the speed of your voice. I will still need to watch this a few time for it to sink in 😊
I play chess and im trying to teach my wife. This video is terrible if you are completely new to chess. Everything is bad.
The guy I like plays chess and I want to know how so I can play or talk about it with him loll
Prince. King that doesn’t have to be checkmated.Moves like a king and attacks 2 squares vertically or horizontally.
ive played chess for 11 years
only here because my crush loves chess
Actually who needs to watch all these chess tutorial videos when low rated?  Just watch Josh waitzkin on chessmaster and do puzzles on chesstempo and lichess. Finished.  Also find it quite absurd to pay a single cent for chess / 9LX when low rated.  The only chess videos to watch when low rated would maybe be openings but why even bother when you can just play 9LX? Lol
Hi im Ariella
Chess looks fun
I was at school and out of no where thought about playing chess. Chess is pretty fun.

Nice
Me pro at chess
i used to play chess, like kind of professionally, but many years ago. the other day we were playing it with a friend and realized how i forgot some things, chess is honestly so amazing everyone should play it
Bruh I'm a 2021 person 2020 people
I'm here because I want to play with my father since he was addicted to this hahaha
or maybe the best word is "inexperienced"
You said queen was most important piece. Wrong. Queen is most powerful. King is most important
l got it
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 chess
En pessant is complex and annoying even for not so beginners 😂😂
Knight does better than Bishop.
I have my own  chess game in real life and I learn sooooo much tanks bright side and my dad🥰🥰🥰
is it just me who learn it from school?
I don’t know why Im here, nobody ever beat me in chess irl or online.
Checkers Difficulty: So Easy  Chess Difficulty : so Hard ♟
Just made 2 moves and my friend already won😂 chess is some bullsh** and confusing.
delete the music please..
You smell
Poker and chess are 2 games I wish my parents had made me learn cheers bright side for being my mum and dad lol
please talk normally😭😭
“The king is the most important because if you lose him you lose the game” is a bit misleading. You can’t actually take a king. You only lose the game when there is no square your king can move to that would keep it safe from the opponent’s piece on the next move.
Never ending rules ✍🏽
I just have one question: How do you do your editings?
This is most helpful for me sir
I love chess its amazing
Thank you for showing us....😊😊
I ❤️ chess
Chess appears to be difficult but I  am willing to learn.
I am here because me and my brother are very competitive
the king is the most important because if you lose him you lose the game
They made two videos on this and the second one evolved backwards
I learned when I was 5 years old. Amazing game.
i really wanna learn chess but i don't know why
you can distract the enemy into thinking you are going for the king or queen
Who’s here from iMessage games
Really helpful
i woman and this help me learn chess! :D <3 i like the video!
I heard only genius plays
What’s a Queens Gambit?  I’m here because of RZA from Wu Tang lol
Tanks bro
I want to learn this for long time..
I’m learning how to play chest because a teacher in my school told me He would buy me free food if I won and im not planning to loss
Thank you
Did he mean the pawns take the row A2-H2? Cause he said hey take A1-H1 and A7-H7
Im here because of my teacher.
Watched all the video & learned everything.  There's just a little *problem* l didn't *understand* a thing
Hey is there even more chess teaching....
I love you Beth Harmon
🙏
i’m here because i kept playing chess on imessage with my friend and neither of us know how to play chess so we always ended in stalemate
Yes
This is the horse (or as some people call it, a “knight”). 💀
Day 1 : watched 4 videos and learnt the basics
i learned to play it when i was 4
Pawns are wrong.  Not labeled according to the appropriate rank/file.....
That's stalemate bruhhh
Hello
Super
THANK U ANYA TAYLOR-JOY
i’m just here because why not 💀
What's queens gambit?
I love chess so much
I love chess
s beteer moov was whit captuer black rook XD
Bishop is 3 point s
i didnt understand sorry
That music is horrible it is like being on hold and that same annoying music plays over and over and over and over and over and over again and again and again and again . . .
i learn alots of this video i like it  and its so importan
Pff forgot everything after he got done talking finna watch it again
If I want to learn chess I want to concentrate on what you're saying. That music is needless and distracting. Your American accent exacerbates the situation, too.
I’m here because it’s a school task lol
Bad
Am i blessed with knowing chess without experience? Yes i am.
i should be studying but i want to impress my crush and he loves chess so i’m here
I'm here mostly influenced by losing and 3 gatsu no lion. Even though in gatsu they played shogi, it isn't available here.
AHHH
I have my idea on how to play chess right now  thank you for having this video!
I've been playing Chess almost my entire life. My mom is a chess addict, and she made me play since I was 4.
Wow😀
slumbo chumbo, I drive the lumbo
7
Bro just the introduction made me not want to get into chess.
Time to become a pro 😁
At somewhere 4:41 the voice over needs to be corrected from "A1 to H1" to a corrected voice over of "A2 to H2" as shown in the animation; but all-in-all the video is very informative.
Me after watching kings gambit and queen of Kuwaiti
20 seconds into the intro and i think i will find a different video of how to play chess. Yuk
Im a middle scholer that has the labrary as home room so me and my home room buddes play ches in the school library
Been rewatching The Wire. The King stay the King, a'ight?
Thanks Bright Side💡😊
Wow chess is the big version of checkers.most checkers characters are like flat pancakes
The Bishop is one of my favorite characters
The most best player I’ve seen is Riaan Joshi and Venon Kurramasamy
wow
im sorry but the explanation of the knight made no sense to me. its hard to explain without showing it but the knight cant move in any bordering space but it has two space within each corner of the cube (the place your in and the spaces around it) but the space you land on has to be the opposite color of the space your on right now
𝙷𝚘𝚠 𝚍𝚘 𝚛𝚘𝚘𝚔𝚜 𝚌𝚊𝚙𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎?
4:41 There was an error in placement of white pawns. This how 🤔 I am watching this video so I can learn chess. I'm moving on from checkers lol
I keep losing of my sis She always win's
y’all are here because of queens gambit or because you’re actually interested i’m here because i’m trying to impress my crush 💀
The queen is the most powerful, not the most important.
Super
Where are my brain cells I lost them
Rooks are called elephant
not bright side , dark side
Game grumps old chess game made me wanna learn this finally
No the points for Bishop is 3 three not 3.5
I actually already know how to play just thought there would be tips for improving my game
I don't know if I'm smart enough?
Thanks for guiding me 🙏🙏🙏
at 4:35 you've incorrectly stated the pawns are placed at A-1 to H-1  (shouldn't it be A-2 to H2?)  Am I the only newcomer to notice this?
I literally destroyed random people in chess with only 4 moves.
I lost three times in imessage i want payback

Chess hard, chess bad
*When you're so focused you accidentally pull a fool's check.*
Dont wanna be that guy, but why the white peice gotta move first?
What happens if there is only kings left on the board?
Where is the Joker ?
I love how everyone is saying they’re here from Queen’s Gambit meanwhile I’m just trying to learn because of Harry Potter. 😭
nobody: me after watching the queens gambit:
Figured it was about time I learned.
absolute uselss guide
4:40 he said A1-H1 for white. I think he meant A2-H2
I'm here because of Black Butler or kuroshitsuji
Should i do drugs? Like the Queen gambit?
Can I beat my father because it’s so hard yo beat him with this
You know the chess game have time
4:40 I think he meant A2 to H2.
Every one : this is so hard Me: WOW ITS SO EASY LET'S MATCH THE PRO RN!
I was literally about to take my brother's king using en passant 😂
5:60
I've wanted to learn for a while. I am googling the moves & meaning (of each piece) first. This video is not helping, if you are clueless. I will get it eventually,  but not without the help of several sources... I will come back to this video though, for strategies....
Wrong, the king is the most important piece on the board....
Thanks for this information.. 🙏
😡😡😡😡😡💦🥶💗
Dgdhix5th
Sfr
😁is the best place to get a unit from
For beginners ok.
Everyone: talking about queens gambit *Me whose here because of "no game no life"👁️👄👁️*
I’m so lost
Bruh i always lose at chess
I remember crushing my foes with this game lol!
Just 1 other rule about castling that wasn't mentioned; you can't castle if there's an enemy piece that can go to the squares in between the king and rook. Love your videos!
Ah yes now i remember why i never learn to play chess. Its too complicated. Thanks for reminding me
I’m actually here because of The Wire. Lots of of the show is compared to chess and even if I didn’t get the concept entirely, it intrigued me on how to at least start playing!
What’s Queens  gambit ?
I'm so confuse
I thought bishop = 3 points
CRP sent me here lol 😆
Got through three minutes but than gave up
Likeeee
Yes
I’m still lost
Thank you nice video
Everyones here from Queens Gambit.  But im from Macro.
Who is here to learn chess so you can beat monika

Your vids are always great but this ain't for beginners!
No one... literally no one  Whole comment section : The Queen's Gambit
Bright Side:Pawn=1 Knight=3 Bishop=3.5 Rook=5 Queen=9 Me:What about the king Bright Side:He has infinite point
i’m only watching this because of code geass
I used to play this but forgot most parts so I'm here
hi can you send a video of me to win instead please let me know how to win this game
Axel, my classmate he plays chess, he’s just 7 years old!
2:14
Most Important Thing to remember . Don't sacrifice your King for queen
When everyones talking about Queens Gambit, and you wanna actually learn it
I like chess cause I imagine the pons like ninjas lol heehee
I love chess!!!!
Am I the only one that came here so I could play chess with monika in MAS (Monika after story)
I just came here to learn then the comment section filled with “Queen’s Gambit" I’m outta here
Why is everyone talking about queens gambit idk what that even is xD
Hey im learning how to learn and my dads buying a chessboard today. Im gonna be the queens gambit
Cool video
In 2019 I won a chess tournament in my society, the whole society participated and I came the first rank in 8 age or above (now I am 10)
I love chess
Lol. I have a chess app too. And I'm so happy uncle bought chess for my cousins XD.
4:43 that is A2 not A1
Anyone else watching this as a 1000+ rated player?
Hi 👋
Me who came here cz he still doesn’t know how the knight works and how to end the game
slightly confused. video says rooks cant jump pieces. does that only apply to enemy pieces? i ask because several parts in the video showed rooks switching to the other sides of king and queen. in the starting row.
The best way to learn is to play with another person who knows how to play. Videos and computer chess will help too, but you'll have to read and keep the rules written next to you when playing.
Im not from Queens gambit and I just analyzed games to get better.
4:40 pawns are a2 - h2 not a1 - h1
you got, the king and the queen mixed up, it’s the queen u need to protect
Comment section is disgusting!
Chess is haram as it involves connections with gambling. Mark my words
Chess is haram
Cri
Thanks 😊
I love to play chess
Still don't get it
As an advance player, this is kinda unhelpful but if you’re a beginner, this is a decent tutorial, perhaps slightly above decent
Everyone from Queen's Gambit Me who is from Code Geass: *confused noises*
Can anyone type me the rules please??
Whys chess so complicated than checkers
6:12 I don't get this part can someone put it in simple terms because I understand the other parts but I just don't understand this part.
"Checkmating may sound like a piece of cake, but it is way more complicated than you think." Le me: Please! When was 9 years old,  I defeated my mom in a literal 7 moves! My record of defeating anyone at chess in the least moves, even today.  Now,  I'm 12 years old. 😉

Who’s watching this for fun but already knows the game?
Not sure 🤔
I still don't know how to get a gud opening lol
This video has huge mistakes in explaining such as when it says placement of pawns he says white are placed from A1 to H1 but actually they placed in video from A2 to H2 so much other mistakes too
1:58 so can the one in the right corner move up?
0:42 like how he says details
I still dont get it so I'm just going to keep watching videos until I get it and then feel confident enough to play online or something lol
I’ve watched this 3 times now and I still don’t understand/know how to play Chess

I thought the king and queen movement’s where the opposite, King can move horizontally and vertically and Queen only the spaces around her. Does it Matter? Asking because I’ve seen this in most of the games I’ve tired online.
Great tutorial 😩😩😩😘😘😘
Who’s here after LTN 100 Games of chess?
chess the most popular board game. basically the more game you play u discovery silly mistake  that you are making in past of your game even in pro level the looser making reckless move that you don't expect from masters and  get him/her into trouble. any way i love the struggle at the ending of the game you learn new thing as much as possible play with different level people  don't think about wining of the game always remember before moving your piece make sure your  king safe  scarify  piece for greatest return .....................  tnx for the video man!
well, i want to learn chess to apply its rules to real life by creating chess analogies and taking clever decisions

Me a Fire Emblem player-   "Im 4 parallel universes ahead of you"
Vo tme podobných v obraze v zrkadle z 12 tu samu z 11 ne existovali 1 opačne oproti sebe opačný 2 /1  oproti sebe 1/2
😲
not me!
U got it mixed up with the king and queen
I don’t understand bright side can it be complicated
im here looking for a video to send to my friend bc I cant figure out how to explain chess to them lol
The real chads came from highschool dxd
Got cocky, challenged someone... Help
I completely forgot how to play and my husband wrote “chess” on my grocery list, so here I am trying to refresh my memory so we can play after dinner tonight.
deadass only here bc im the only one in my friend group and in my family that has no clue how to play
for the pawns you said a1 to h1 and a7 to h7 but its a2 to h2 and a7 to h7
I’m here not because I want to learn, but I NEED TO learn chess for our performance task😀
Ok, great! All I need now is a ceiling, a Soviet-Latvian chess set, and some green tranquillizers. Oh and I should befriend that old male janitor in my school's basement. Wish me luck! ;)
they say this is a big rich town
I'll stick with Checkers
2:01 wait, thats illegal, b1
Thank you 🙏🏿
I am Indian
Great presentation! Easy to understand
Hamd had l9lawi
I am the best player my friends say
Wow
That's the game i want to learn but i didn't have any contact who know how to play chess
I want to buy chess now😀😀😀😀
correction: files are horizontal,  ranks are vertical. and yes im mentioning this on a 2 year old video xd
You said pawns take h1 to h1 but they do not, they take h2 to h2 4:40  And you said that bishops have a point value of 3.5, they don’t, they have a value of 3 points 7:15
So basically king is just capture the flag And queen is stronk feminist
Proud to be Indian origin of this game is INDIA 😎
Nice
thank youuuu  now i can play chess nicely not to be a nub :) <333 thxx
can the king capture others?

thank you lol xqc plays so much chess and im always confused
it rlly helped me
Legit the animations can make this very hard for new players. Like the king surrounded by pons?? That litterially cannot happen. The point system is also kind of biased. Alot of this is kind of misleading and hard to understand for a fully new player
I watched queen's gambit but I like this
I love queen’s gambit
You are 😎 at ♟ chess
wooooooooooooow ang galing

Beth learns Chess from the janitor in the basement of an orphanage. I learnt it from an iphone on the couch eating snacks..
no I'm not here from queens gambit, i just wanna learn how to play chess
So you have to make your piece to step on the square that the opponents piece is to eliminate there piece?
So who’s gonna provide me the janitor and the green ones that are better at night ??
😀
anyone else think the narrator sounded a little sarcastic at the beginning
i like that a lot of us are here bc of the queen's gambit :))))))))))))))
Everybody’s talking about the queen gambit or whatever, while I came here after watching Code Geass and black butler and wanting to learn because of Lelouch and Ciel...😅

Wow, super handy !

Here for iOS guide
I'm 33 and I learned chess when I was a kid. I just came here to see how many queen's gambit comments I could find 😂
I’m just here because I’m done with my uncle beating me at every. single. game
“that’s totally barbaric!”
I think everyone coming here because watching  queen gambit on netflix
Folish
I came here not knowing a single thing and five minutes in I new how to play
I learned chess by watching other kids play at high school and i started playing. I lost all the time 😂😂😂   They just showed me how the pieces move and we played, i learned the hard way. Despite my experience in chess, i struggled to play at varsity level because i didn't know the official rules and timing😭  I feel like a beginner again, long story short, how's the pandemic?  😁
I like Queen's Gambit
The only way to you do chess vs checkers is you get a board game with both of them.
came here straight after watching 2 episodes of Queens Gambit😂😂😂
I WANNA BE BETH
I think its a lot more simple once you know the names of the pieces and where they go and where on the board they can move. the difficult thing is once you start playing and the strategies to win. you have to think about what your opponent might do and even think like 2 moves or more ahead.
Am i the only one here not from queens gambit o.o
Because The Queens Gambit sent me here ...
thank you this helps me
NOT ME TRYNA BE BETH
I’m ready to beat Borgov now

so i am the only one here for Spencer Reid?
ITS BAD
The Queen's Gambit 😁
Great video, nice job!
Dude, Bishop had a value of 3 not 3.5
He left out the stalemate situation. Also, the queen is the most powerful piece, not the most important piece. The king is the most important piece. Oh and white always moves first.
Who here hasn’t watched the queens gambit?
protect your king you will be disqualified
Who's here before watching the Queen's Gambit?
this voice makes me feel like i'm having a fever dream

♞▀▄▀▄♝▀▄
Here from Queen's gambit
My regular start  1. e4 e5
I'm here to ACTUALLY learn how to play chess
Definitely here after Queen’s Gambit
Queens gambit brought me here if you’re asking😂😂
also you cannot castle through a check.. the path should not be controlled by opponent's piece
I just watch this to make sure it is not wrong Funfact:2 rooks can cause a checkmate
Who else is here from The Queen's Gambit
I’m not here from queen’s gambit, I’m here to learn chess because it’s so fcking hard
this is so confusing already but I'm willing to try 😔
Around 3 minutes 40 seconds in you say "basically, the queen is the most important piece". THE KING IS! THE QUEEN IS THE MOST POWERFUL, NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT!
There's a mistake in 7:15, The bishop's value is 3 points only (like the Knight) not 3.5
I watch this video five times and every time by the end of it I forget everything
From queen's gambit😂😂
This guys voice is really causing a fight or flight response in me
Please do more for me
I still don't get it
I came here from code geass, not queen’s gambit
Who’s here because they’ve actually played chess before Queen’s gambit?

I'm here for higher IQ lol
This is wrong
king is more important then the queen
4:29 try to  protect him at all costs? well the checkmate happens with the knight because he can jump over the pawns
You look like a cheap chess piece why are you so expensive
This year down poker rabbit hole now learning chess

I guess I'm the only one who isn't here because of Queens Gambit
Promotion Pond when reaches the eighth rank can be replaced by players choice? meaning any 8th rank A to H can change to a Queen and if 3 ponds make it there you can technically have 3 queens?
Bright side should disable the comments.
here because of the queen's gambit (2,936x)
The perfect way to understand all this is by checking the wikipedia page “rules of chess”....they have explained from head to toe briefly and preciesly.....it also shows diagrams of every rule and move.....you can also take a break while reading and memorize or practice all the rules or moves in your head its the better way to understand for a beginner like me...when you have read every word from that article and played it in your head then its done...congrats you have learned every single thing about chess precisely now its up to you to do a practice with your partner or a computer through an app....but it will only feel real when you have played it with a person....and then you can go on to improve your self.....you cannot be a perfect player...you will learn/improve yourself/build new techniques through time.....be patient.....if you are thinking of buying a chess set....then i recommend go for a marble chess board and chess pieces they are heavy and feels rich....you can order it from aliexpress or your local store/online store.....like amazon as i live in pakistan so i have ordered one from daraz.......Hope it helped you if yes feel free to share it .......take care....and yes i came here from the queen’s gambit :)
5:38 “it may sound like a piece of cake” yeah see that’s the thing no
Can y’all break it down for me in the comments? I too lazy to watch the whole video lol 😂

Beth Harmon brought me here
I’ve played Chess since I was 5, and mainly play myself since very few my age know how to or have the attention span. Stoked more people are interested from the Netflix show. There’s a lot that can be learned from this game.

Anyone inspired  from samay raina here?
i’m here after queens gambit
Wow...The mysterious world of chess has got me hooked..confusing though it may be 🤔
I
Terrible intro, lost me in the first 30 secs.
1k random views and 3M after watching queen’s gambit LOL
I still can"t get it haha I have a new chess board given by a friend but don't know how to play
Do you actually have to say “check” out loud? I mean is that an official rule? I often don’t see people say it at tournaments. I’m assuming it more of a formality than an official rule? I just started trying to learn chess about 3 days ago
Okay on my 1st watch I did not understand.  I downloaded a chess app and after like 10 games I got better and came back to watch. I understand it enough to strategize now!   I'll play some more then come back a 3rd time to understand the last quarter of the vid. I think those tactics are helpful but I'm not there yet.
The queens gambit anyone??? (Beth and Benny...I SHIP IT)
POV: You’re looking for Macro’s comment.
:))))Macro army here
Never learned after this insight,  I'll stick to best of 7 $5.00 Checkers matches
I'm only here because I want to prove to my sister that the knight moves two squares forward, not three.
Who's here to understand The Queen's Gambit?
i think we can all agree we're here from queen's gambit
Not me thinking I’m the next Beth .
When 99% of the comment section is about the Queen's Gambit.
I thought myself chess when I was 2, I am 14 now. And Im still watching this
Nope. Just here trying to be an autodidact.
I’m now writing to Santa for a chessboard on Christmas

Who’s here after watching Queen Gambit? 😂😅
We all tryna become world champion like   Beth huh? Mmm i don’t like this, too much competition 🤨🤨😂
Small correction - at 4:41 it says the white pawns are on A1 - H1; should be A2 - H2.
4:39 there's a mistake in pawn's formation. They go for A2 to H2.
Im here after queens gambit
The music is VERY distracting. Thumbs down left video after 1:30
I'm only watching because if I don't do an activity and get lonely I go crazy in my head
Video starts at 0:59
NOW TELL ME WHERE TO GET THE GREEN PILLS? I'M READY!!!

Who's here after Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone?  Since everyone is talking about kids mastering chess, and we are all grown and still trying to figure out this complex boardgame😂
Who's here because they want to learn how to play and not because of queens gambit?

Who’s here to ask “who’s here after watching The Queen’s Gambit”?! 😂
I've always wanted to learn chess, but never had anyone to physically play it with. The Queen Gambit just relit my desire to learn and my aunt loved it, so I'm hoping she'll play it with me 🤣
Who’s here after watching code geass
Everybody: Who's here after watching Queen's Gambit Me: Why am I even watching this If I know this game for 7 years.
I WILL BEAT BORGOV

Quarantine is giving us presents.. many are trying to learn something new.
Definitely queens gambit that inspired me
They forgot to mention the fourth rule of castling. The king can not end his move in check and he may not cross a space that would put him check.
Pro bro pro🤙😎
Who's here after Harry Potter and Philosopher's stone?
The queens gambit😏
After watching The Queen's Gambit I wanna play 😂😂😂

Instructions unclear. I take tranquilizers before playing.
Who else finished the Queen Gambit in a day
Here after watching The Queens Gambit 😂😂

Fine y'all caught me. I'm here because of "The Queen's Gambit"
I didn't download chess and I definitely didn't rush right here after seeing the Queen's Gambit on Netflix😭
I got in here after I watched the first episode of the queens gambit lol
Great motivational movie in a long time. If you weren't interested you might be now. Missing aspect now a days in cinema
is it just me or does the chess board illustrated here have a weird optical illusion effect? like the back corner square looks bigger than the front corner square this is weirdly very distracting lol but maybe that's just my add
Just sayin', the pawns are in A2 to H2 for one player not A1 through H1... Great video otherwise...
Who’s here after watching queens gambit?
Every chess player isn't cool and intellectual. Stop with this mediocre mentality.

I'm here because of The Queen's Gambit. Girl made me want to learn how to play chess.
Thank you very much indeed for this very bright and elaborate introduction to Chess game for beginners. I feel more comfortable now to start this interesting adventure, enthusiastically looking forward for some more practical tips.
Anyone else here because they watched no game no life and wanted to learn how to beat your friends
Netflix brought me here
Anyone else here after watching The Queen's Gambit?
Massive help this. Thank you.
POV you just watched a show about chess and enjoyed it even though you dont know to play at all
Queens Gambit brought me here 🤣
why do chess pieces are named differently in my country?
4:40 pawns take up A2 to H2, not A1 to H1
I’m watching because I’m tired of my 10 year old son beating me all the time!!
I always be white in chess
this is harder than science i learn VERY easily when watching science videos ESPECIALLY if its The Bright Side but this its harder than i expected
all I know is that im crazy about learning this game!
oh this is just moving the pieces      later bois
I'm only watching this because my peasants keep on failing when I play peasant's revolt by myself.
King in Chess - What a liability !
Who is here after watching Code Geass.
Thanks for the tricks
☺️ I am from India
Actually, King can capture the queen if the queen has no defender
Was just thinking... What if on the battlefield everyone has to move like dis...🤐😂 Jeezz😝😝
viva
Милая!
What ever I do my father defeats me
Queen is not actually most important but most powerful piece!
I'm so bad at chess the opponent said, "White castles"...so i went & got some burgers. 🤦‍♂️
basic intro to chess but i am pro
i am endgame expert lol
This helps me know how to play ♟chess ♟
flashback when my friend taught me how to play but actually bended all the rules on her favor
Haven't watched completely yet, will continue after if I may bring yur attention to a voice over error. At 4:44 precise, it spoke pawns from H1 to A1. Significantly a small error, easy to recorrect by H2 to A2 for a well played player, but I might doubt this in case for new comers or as yu say Beginners. Kindly have a look at it. If already done so, please ignore. Have a Bright Side of the night :)
I’m still trash
Got it all the pieces are useful but the queen is overpowered. Do I got that right. Lol
Well at least I can name the pieces ♟
Came here after watching critikal demolish xQc in 6 moves lol
i forgot how to play chess on cool math games so i am here
I am 21 years 😂
I already knew chess but I wanted to see what this is. I saw a rook capturing a king. I cringed.

I want to learn to play chess 🐴vs🐴
Ebbe
i like it
Did anyone send this video to a friend who constantly lose againt you in chess?
l'm more confused after watching the vid learned nothing 😭😭
Why don't you make a video on How to play Shogi . Its like chess but with a lot more pieces and spaces and also you can reuse pieces you capture from your opponent
Who doesn't know how to play chess
Do you have to eat in ♟?
I searched this up because I watch Black Butler... AND I AM VERY CONFUSED
Bro the bishop is 3 points. The King is the most important piece. If you lose the King it’s end game. The game continues if you lose the queen.
Menay apna naya channel khola hai usko bhi subscribe karo plz
Nice video
Some app maybe
I would like a trial game somewhere
hi, it’s 7 am, i haven’t slept yet, and felt like learning how to play chess 😀
i already know how to play chess
Am I the only confused 😐
i just want to be able to impress people. im already a wholeass nerd but like  i wanna have a nerdy relationship where we both play chess. falsettos whO
I'm here because of Dr. Reid
The comments put me off watching this video.
I had to scroll down to see if anyone else caught the narrator’s mistake. The pawns are located on A2-H2 and A7-H7.
I just want to write a poem about it 😂
i just came from Trash taste channel of connor gigguk and joey after playing the tournament arc xD
I wanted to learn card tricks and somehow this was related
Paint all the blocks white😅
Nice it really helps me because I'm just a beginner thank youu
Why does this guy sound like a mixture of Nicolas Cage and Jeff Goldblum?
VAMOS INCENTIVAR AS PESSOAS A JOGAR!!
Its easier to look at the board from straight up, and it is suggested by most players. Plus, you should teach developing your minor pieces before learning how to do en passant.
*CheckhMateu*
Hey Brightside the knights could win because they can jump over pieces so be careful if you're playing chess anyways and thanks for the advice
two min in and im sleeping lol chess is so boring its like looking at paint dry
9:49 rook hopping king what?
Lusu
Lusu
Bright Side, cool channel‼ Pleace make 'How To Play Chess part 2' Thanks‼
the reason why I wanted to watch how to play chess game...was because i was bored of quarantine
The problem is that our opponent is also watching this...
G
I want to try play chess after knowing there's level when the chess player (master I think???) can play in their mind like without the chess and it's somehow the sexiest
I need a new brain to be able to play chess for beginners!!
Ay, this game requires an IQ over average!!
This game it’s really intellectual!!
you have to watch this viode   it is amazing
nope NOT subscribing
Is that Casey Kasem
Me playing with my dad and almost win: yeahhhhh My dadfeeling defeated: okay, lets stop playing, i have a work to do Me: ...
WOOOW
I don't understand I'm just stoopid
I won chess against my mother
You cannot use word cutted instead you can use cut 7:59
thanks now i can play chess
Poliiii
me after watching falsettos:
I liked the video I'll like more thank you
Sir please speak in hindi
My mother thought that the queen was not able to go far
Just to make somethings clear  3:39 no, she isn’t the most important piece, the king is  A bishop is 3 points not 3.5  And also when I was in chess club, there’s a 8 year old that used to smash everyone including me, he was even making the chess teacher a bit challenged by him, who’s a fide master (FM), second highest fide rating (fide stands for Fédération Internationale des Echecs which is French for International Federation of Chess)  Chess originated in India in 800 AC
I already know how to play chess, I’ve known for years, but I watched this just because I’m bored
Bushop and knight have same vlue as 3. And bishop have slightly better and it decides according to the position,and obviously sayings in end game bishops are more powerful. I think,we can say knight have 3 value for where as bishop have 3.15
Thanks for letting me know about this game called chess.
There are some Chess Players in my grade and before Quarantine started, they taught the rest of us how to play, this is perfect to refresh my knowledge, after not playing for four months ^^
Please comment.Are you all interested in chess
Beautifully explained
what do you mean CHECKMATE!?!?
I thought chess was just drafts with different props ahaha
CALLING ALL CHESS PLAYERS...and anyone who would like to learn. I've started a NEW chess channel for beginners and intermediate players. Check it out.
saying a king cant capture queen is bad for beginners
I'm only here because of highschool dxd 😅
i like the video
horrible music
My brain hurts.
Boo
Wow!! what a instructions about chess
You can't castle when there are pieces that is attacking the tiles in between the rook and the king. You forgot to mention that. 12:25
White hose first....RACEST
Sir, you missed a condition in castling, which is that you can't castle through check
I've started a chess channel for anyone who likes to play or wants to learn.
Eho else is here from code geass
me:scrolling in the comments  also me after the video ended: I dont understand any thing
I remember thinking what if the king moves anywhere but cant take pieces and the queen moves one space at a time but she pushes the piece you decide to move forward towards the direction it is already headed to
I remember Harry Potter Wizard Chess
9:51 you just jumped the king with the ROOk
Sorry, but this is NOT a useful video for a beginner to learn to play chess from. When I saw how short it was I was suspicious. After teaching for 21 years (6 national champions and 1 Pan-Am champion) Kids ALWAYS have a LOT of difficulty with knights and bishops. ALSO several types of draws are much more common with beginners! ALSO Use standard tournament style pieces instead of that dimestore minuature!
In which world did the bisshop get 3.5 points? Bruh
4:25 is it only me or you cant lose the king, you king can only get trapped?
herohei
I have a question are you a master at chess?
Thank you bright side
Ok ok
SO MANY SUBSCRIBERS
i m chess player (and am very bad at it ) see if u r confused between the placing of the king and queen read this comment   the king is always on the e file or squares e1 - e8 and the queen is always on d file or d1 - d8
I just got a 30 second ad that u can't skip  1like=1prayer

pinkfloyd
Brightside: Queen most important Me:huh Brightside(talking To champion)Queen are rooks plus bishops Champion:huh Brightside: oops I forgot that Queen is 9 points and king is infinite points
Code Geass brought me here tbh
I always thought chess was fun, but this video proved me otherwise. I think I'll just get back to normal video games
He is my dad
Mama
Ummmm.....I still dont get it
It's not queen, its Minister
Thank you, I learnt lot of things in chess.
I think I was following along until about 8 minutes and then I blanked out
After watching the whole video with an adv, I'm just gonna forget the fact i was actually here to play chess. 😂
Phiona Mutesi make me want to learn the chess game:She is a Ugandan chess player. She was born in Katwe, the largest of Kampala's eight slums. Mutesi has won the Ugandan Women's Junior Championship three times, has represented Uganda at four chess olympiads, and is one of the first titled female players in Ugandan chess history. She is the subject of a 2012 book and a 2016 film called Queen of Katwe
I feel intimidated by Ciel Phantomhive, so i came here.
If there's a board game that is most rage inducing, it's definitely chess (believe me, I know from experience). But, on the other hand, it's also the most satisfying. The feeling you get when perfectly outplaying and out smarting your opponent is incredible, no other board game can achieve it.
so cool
Thankyou very much
Thanks quarantine.
Chess masters: examine and predict hundreds of next moves of their opponent   Me got a massage from a girl: examines and predicts several possible next massages to keep the conversation but ends up finishing it within 4 turns

I understand all thank you 😊
I understand all thank you 😊
My mom promised to play and learn chess a few months ago...it never happened
Error at 4:28 It's impossible for white pawns to get to the first rank.
12:21 additional rule: you can't castle through a check.  You forgot to add that to the castling rules.👆
You didn't mention the *Stalemate.*
Error at 7:13 The knight and bishop have the same numerical value/point. I.e 3  3.5 doesn't exist.   You also forgot to add that the King's Numerical value is ∞ i.e infinite value because it's loss also means the loss of the game
6:16 In professional tournaments, it's not allowed to say the word "check" out loud as it is regarded as a disturbance to your opponent. Professional players usually notice a check so there'll be no need of saying it, however, if your opponent didn't see the check(which is almost impossible), it's allowed to tell him/her about the check, then your opponent would  take back his move and play another move to put his king to safety.
Error at 3:38, though it's the most powerful piece, the Queen is not the most important piece, the king is the most important because it's loss also means the loss of the game.
Error at 4:39,  it's a2 to h2 for White's pawns not a1 to h1.
Who else came here from the chimera ant king from hunter x hunter
Dhanyavam bright sadam
I just wanted to feel cool by knowing how to play chess but now my head hurts and I keep rewinding it to try to understand but it makes it worse
What about tactics
WHY DID YT ADD UNSKIPPABLE ADS
Now I can play chess with Monika and know what I'm doing.
The onley target on is just the queen😂😂😂
Im only here because of No Game No Life.
4:39 "they take the rows from a1 to h1..." *proceeds to fly onto rows a2 to h2"
Bruh Hide the chess, people gonna complain how "white" pieces get to move first
8:03 isn’t it A2 - H2?
Better than the last vid I saw, but I still don't understand UwU
Bright side I can’t win and I’m losing a lot and I’m crying a lot plz help plz
Watched video & learned everything. I still don’t know how to play.
I just wanna play basketball......I took it literally dont judge me.
I am here because apparently everyone on twitch is playing chess!!
11:02 please  explain  this  someone
THANK YOU SO MUCH ILY, YOU GUYS HELPED ME OUT SM ILY
How many check can be apply on king !
T H R O B B I N G
I need another quarantine to understand this.......🤔
This confused me even more
Yeet
Yo
IemaBeginner
You failed to mention 2 additional castling rules: a king can't castle out of check nor can he move thru check.
👑
11:15 bad choice of words. Yes true, you must capture immediately but you shouldn't if it doesn't benefit you. You are NOT obligated to capture en passant.
Too bad this insufferable music blocks my thinking.
is donald trump commentating ?
Trying to learn chess this is the new trend on Twitch
‏Please watch my channel 😻👏🏻👏🏻 ‏I make a video every day for a new game🤍😁👏🏻💙
This video is the best. I could barely move a peice
i'm just trying to learn the basics because i know my dad used to love playing chess so i can play with him and hopefully beat him. just a big surprise when i can actually keep up with him.
You guys chose the wrong background music for this type of video! something mellow might've been excellent
my name is aiden
i like it
thanks man now i learn to play chees i subscribed you
Please teach me the wooden shield
thanks
Chess is actually very easy to play once you actually play it instead of just watching videos.
I think I’ll go play uno
you said the queen is the most important piece and that is a mistake
More confused after watching this video than when i started 😂
moral of the video : kings are useless like all men , they take credit while the QUEEN go battle in the field. ALL HAIL THE QUEEN !!!
My brain refused to understand Chess completely. I get ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!
Getting a PHD is easier than understanding the mad ramblings of this game
Wow! This video tells a lot about chess... Thanks!👍
back off homies imma be a magnus carlsen after quarantine
I know you watchin this bec of kakegurui I see yah!
what does this mean???
7:25 the bishop is NOT 3.5! It is 3.30
😍😍
Me thinking horse is knight is called horse 😅🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
Nah I'm not subbing
I need to keep learning, over ptsd and add
i always win at chess game
I'll stick to monopoly and poker
The most powerful piece in chess: The queen.    The most loved piece: The queen. The piece I use to deliver most checkmates: The queen. The most useful piece: The queen. BUT.... The piece after which the game ends: The KING
Still need someone to show me
This is where quarantine has brought me
I have a have a 6 or 7 year old chess plate and there's one chess piece missig 😭. It's the second Black Knight
So (Bright Side) has 35M subscribers, while (Wengie) has 14M subscribers. Poor Wengie😭
Don’t get it trying to understand
My grandfather teach me how to play when we find my or our chess
Anyone else here because of Lelouch from Code Geass? Or Anime in general? 💠🌐
Hey , bright side , why don't you post openings , gambits , tricks like Siberian trap , halosar trap legal's mate etc in chess
So the rock can jump over a queen and a king, only if it is its first move?
weeweeno
Who made a game with the Queen 👸🏾 more powerful than a King 🤴🏾 that's idiocy.
Yes want to learn, but was too much to grasp by the end
To help my mind. I've always wanted to learn to play it's almost intimadatimg to be honest I've asked my Mother to learn to play w me she's very intelligent me myself I always doubt myself an if I learn to play Chess more I believe ill have more self esteem it's just a fascinating game thank u for your videos
Strategy.... I have now found the passion for it. Looking forward to buying my own chess board
nice
Here cause of code geass and I was watching XQC play
The initial discussion of rook captures might not be clear.  That turned me off the video.  It doesn’t show an example. Pawns from a1 to h1????   You must say check?   Real chess players don’t say check.  A bishop should be 3.25 according to Bobby Fischer.  I agree. A rook and two pawns are usually better than two bishops.  Also, can’t castle across check.
Class of 2012 Vineland high school NJ senior year chess class was fun.Chess is my favorite...chess professor miss have of semester so we had substitute who was weird and funny
when i was playing chess my pon went all the way to the other side  then i got another queen
It took me 55 years and 1 pandemic quarantine to get here.
Q = 1pawn 1rook 1 bishop 1+5+3=9 Q=9
Anybody an experienced player yet visiting here?thumbs up
*me & my friend playing chess* My friend: Wait, you can't move horse vertically! Me: Do you ever play Skyrim?
i’m here to learn because i need to take revenge on my computer
King not queen  King important  Queen strongest
This is really helpful! But I don't think it will beat my dad -_-
After watching .....Lelouch vi Britannia....i had to came here
Why am I watching this?  I already know how to play chess 😐
Who heard black queen and white queen sound wrong
So the ponds upgrade when they reach the other side?
Easy peasy lemon sqeesy
why at 12:00 the rooks are floating
I’ve decided to become a chess grandmaster during this quarantine period.
One question:can the queen move in a horizontal and vertical in the same turn?
You missed a word
pawns are weird they reach the other side to turn into other pieces that already got captured
🤟
I left because of how he pronounced details
I really wanna learn but I don’t get it any tips from the pros?
You don't need to tell check, infact  in real chess tournaments its considered impolite to say check
My 7 years old loves this video. She actually learned how to play chess here and then taught her 4 years old sister . So funny how they played together :-)
“I’m not even a beginner I just forgot” gang?  Edit: now I’m back bc of queens gambit 🙂
Ur video is not clear
The music is confusing
lets stick to shogi
Wow I just started how to play chess in 2020
Also bright side u forgot about chess fide rating.i do not have one however
I actually know how to play chess before.I was just watching this video to see what bright side has to say.
You can say knight has only jump to others  but you not explain how rook move jump queen in 9:50 pls explain it
Isn't it funny what quarantine makes us learn 😂💔
welcome your royalhighnessess ha!
Thanks bright side this really did help me learn to play chess
2020ond uzej baigaan like 👍
THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL
But what if ur opponent watched this
I’ll be the next Bobby Fischer in no time ♟
4:40  Correction its A2 to H2.
the way you showed how you can move the knight was terrible.  It moves to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally.  You shouldve shown it in a better location.
the most inportant piece is not the queen it is the king if you lose the king you lose the game
Me : bro let's play chess Bro: ok let's start After 5 min since game started Me : with full concentration plays a move Bro: checkmate
I showed it to my dog now he play football
10:18-10:23 Thats what she said
The best way to really understand the game and learn many strategies is to play "Countless" times with a chess gamer/pro
i love this
I remember in elementry school you would have a partner check over your work. Wish that was done here xD pawns on 2 not 1.
Can queen jump?????
5:05 - 5:21 WHAT
it took a global pandemic for me to learn chess smh LOL
If you have any questions hit me up
Instructions unclear. My Board had a white tile in its lower left corner. The matrix did an unexptected reboot. Sorry ... :-(
9:49 i dont think thats is a legal move son
I love your videos please do more
I wanna play chess, thanks for the help buddy
thank youuuu
🍃 Very helpful & best chess tutorial 🍃
No Game No Life  ノーゲーム・ノーライフ
Thnks that explained everything... Love it...
Imagine if there is 3 kings on the board :)
ANYONE INTERESTED CUZ OF NO GAME NO LIFE??
Why I'm here i already know how to play
I hv one last doubt. If soldier passes one to other end for example; my white soldier passes to other end in the place of elephant, bt I hv both elephant pawns so what should i do? Is that soldier is waste...? Plz anyone cleary doubt
Who's else here learn from watching Kanan on power?
Great video overall and outstanding for beginners. Very clear and concise, 10/10 recommend.
Chess has been portrayed as a tool for strategy in movies...That's why am here🤔
The only brightside video that got me confused 😂
I really like your vids
I got interested because of money hiest haha
Me:hmm am a beginner soo..
I'm playing a game against my little sister.
Thanks...
super👍
The Queen ♛ is not the most important piece on the board, that would be the King 👑   The Queen ♛ is the strongest piece on the board.   The King 👑 is the only piece that cannot be taken of the board, but can be put in check or checkmate. In checkmate the game ends though
i dont like this game because the opponents always keeps thinking hours before he moves his soldiers
😉🎟️🎉🎉😅🎫🙂😊😋😙😘😘🎎😍🎏😚🎑🎑
Um i still dont understand
I a chess master
Quarantine tings
Can you show checkers
Am I the only one here watching this cause of no game no life anime
I'm still confused!
Audio provides an incorrect explanation for arranging the white pawns
Explanation was very nice and easy
Why am I watching this video? I’m a Grand Master. lol
can u teach us about 4 moves in chests??
I have promised someone to play with him
9:48 why did u swap places of the rook with the king? Is that an option in chess? Or did u just cheat? 🤣
WOW
Do not start a chess game if you're just going to put your "king" in the middle of the board unprotected and uninformed to find out how brave or tough he is. Chess is about mastery. Not 12 year old gang initiation...
I'm here because I make the same mistake after it comes down to a very few pieces and lose lol
Narrator: The person with the white pieces goes first.  Me: Pfft, Something’s never change.
I have no idea how I beat some kiddos the way I did in school, but I was sort of in the zone...  "I think I blacked out."
White Queen and Black queen😂
6:18 no you dont lol
I know I'm not the brightest but, how come he didn't explain WHY he moved the pieces where he moved them at the beginning. Can anyone just be clear please
Wait how do you play chess again?
Thanks
Great vid!!!!
Why is the pawn on the Rook Introduction isnt promoted
2:46
Very nice.Thank you Sir.
Me: i will never learn chess Later  Me:This is so easy
Thank you bright side
For beginner players the queen is the most important piece which is why you should only move it and not worry about mate.
not showing off that ik chess but this is bs can u not just show an opening??
I'm working with a backwards pattern board, & tiny pieces, my head hurts.
My dad makes me watch this but than doesn’t let me play
You can’t take a king out you have to get him in check mate im a pro
The king is the most important piece
yesterday my friend broke a finger playing basketball, my mom got to know about it and took advantage
I know how to play chess, but after seeing the Backgammon tutorial I was wondering if the chess tutorial was also confusing.  It is.  Really not helpful for new players, a better tutorial would be to watch someone play it.
Honestly, I have yet to fully comprehend the rules of chess, ... however, I will say that I know that by playing chess, it will teach me many strategies, benefits and advantages about playing the game of life itself simply because the game of chess is in fact, a microcosm of life's set rules.
Demek ki olumlu bak kanalı çalıntıymış
Is there a follow up to this video??
LIFES A SHAM AND EVERY MOVE IS WRONG!
thanks guys, the way you explained it is just amazing!
11:20 - Hilarious, I'll use that in my stand ups from now on
lololololololololololololololololololololololol omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg
О
Who understand    I  I V
I dont get It
YES
This leaves me with 1 more question .... who invented chess 😎
4:40 it’s  A2 to H2 not A1 to H1.
*people actually wanting to learn to play chess because almost everybody in their class does, and they wanna impress their crush?*
uhhh 5:45 that is a Stalemate... not a checkmate
Here for a refresher on chess; my 4 year old grandson is beginning to play and I don't want him outmanouvering Granny! :)
What is this madness? Sudoku is much easier!
Me after watching world championship chess and try to understand the rules
This to hard I’m finna loose should have never challenged my teacher
That's the real start for everybody who would like to get some interest of the chess. But the journey just begins here, it's still a lot to learn and study. Really recommend that game for improving your brain potential and mental performance. Chess is also great to find the friends around the World and have fun with them. If you want to passively watch the game played by others first, come to my channel - I focus on chess principles, chess history but I also comment the newest tournaments ;)
Lordt. That was a whole lotta rules to remember.....
Some times dont you think that why didn't I write that I know I am not the only one 😋
My instagram is : noname.com20 follow my please 👍👍👍❤️ but you’re video soo nice 👍 💜💜
I Love Chess  Very Mu ch
did you sure that pawn can take pice righ to him diagonaly I am not sure.
2:04 The only thing wrong here is the black Pawn isn't something else
Chess is nice but you ever try Pokémon?
cool
Let me get this straight, you say rooks and knights, instead of castles and horses? Am I being thick?
I tried this and I won my father btw I am just 9 and he is 59
Out of 50% peples learn chess from Windows  7 game *Chess titans*
When castling the king cannot move through a square that would put it into check. He didn't mention that
He kinda sounds like the dude from the pacer test 😂
I'm going through a phase where I feel like I'm not good enough or smart enough, hopefully this will soothe those feelings if I learn.
Now I know to ply chess thanks
This video isn’t a complete video, it is missing some parts of chess
A bishop is worth 3, not 3.5
plz make more chess videos because i need to beat my dad
Looks like at the start at around 4:40 there is a incorrect positioning narrations for pawns, video say a1 to h1 instead of a2 to h2
Sweet, now I'm ready to challenge Magnus
I came here from watching code geass
I just wanna learn how to sacrafice my queen like in Tower Heist
It introduced the castling move to the right, but isn't there also a castling move to the left? And if so, can anyone give me a run down?.....Well I'm not asking you to run me down but if there is such a move to the left as to the right, what is the procedure?
Thank India for chess. Originated in India.
watching this cause the guy i’m talking to wanted to play a game of chess and i completely embarrassed myself.
*After watching...*  *Well, I still don't understand...*
I needed this, I’m *SO* bad at Chess
The guy sounds like a very cheery Nicolas Cage
The bishop is only 3 points. Right?
You forgot stalemate
Bad guide
I came here to learn how to play and I'm more confused than ever before.
Thanks its interesting.
I don't get the check or French. Word
post more video
beautiful explanation..sir
Nice
I'm just here because Lelouch from Code Geass is my favoutite anime character.
0:43 "Click subscribe and turn on notifications" Talking guy: Gives example by pressing subscribe. Talking guy: Doesn't give example of pressing notification button. Me: Ok Boomer, gUEsS I wOnT bE dOInG EitHer.
Omg he said pawn as a1 to h1
Thank you Bright Side! You are amazing!
Am I the only one who still dont get it.
I wanna hear him do a video without the tv voice.
Nice video
thanks to the indians who invented this game

The fastest checkmate by magnus carlsen video on my recommended feed finally brought me here.
Looks interesting
I've been playing chess for 3 years and YouTube recommends this
Me not beginner
m
BRIGHT SIDE: *Circles random thing in red* Views: *Stoinks!*
You did not mention all the rules 9f castling. 1.the king should not be in check 2.the king should not land in a check after castling 3.the king should not pass through a square controlled by an enemy piece 4.there should be no peices  in between the king and the castling rook. 5.the king and the castling rook should not have moved before in the game
The reason I'm watching such video is because I wanna know about the move at 9:48
Anyone else here because of the worlds fastest game video.
Wait a minute!! If we said check we are making him alert but professional doesn't do that it's not necessary
I am a child and I’m good at it my kid(my child is good at playing chess)
I play chest everyday ek.
Cool
Amazing ❤️
King can't capture the other King or Queen.....What? 🤔
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
A
*still idont understand sad to say but we hve chess battle later at school and sure I will be fcked up*
Yeah I’ll stick with checkers
I think the Knight is the most powerful piece.
This was the most convoluted explanation of the rules of chess I’ve ever seen.
Did you know the board itself tells the story creation from A1. Ace of Hearts (God) and in the beginning it was dark until the Lord said "Let there be light (A2) and everything that came forth from darkness into light multiplied the white squares all over the universe in perfect divine order. A1 sits in the bottom left corner of the board which represents the Eastern horizon where everything in the heavens is born and reborn. So the Sun rises from A1 ascends to the heavens we see above us to A8 and travels across the sky to H8 where the Sun descends down towards the Western Horizon from H8 to H1 into the unseen heavens below the Western Horizon and back towards A1 where creation is reborn... in the beginning it became dark again until the Lord said.... In the duality of light and dark. The Mind is our hidden Mother in all of us... The Mind that speaks to only you, she has two children, The Divine Masculine, Mars the God of chaos,  destruction and motivation, he governs the left side of the brain where thoughts become reality which connects to the Right side of your physical body (King, E1, White or E8, Black). The Divine Feminine governs the Right side of the brain where creativity, thoughts and ideas are born and this side of the brain connects to the Left side of the physical body (Queen, D1 White, D8 Black). White pieces represent your physical life and the Black pieces represent the spiritual side of life where you ultimate goal sits as the Black King whatever your goal may be in life, once you have chosen a goal or dream, you can then play the game to find the best moves and approaches towards your brand new car (Black King) and the only casualties that come off the board are the meetings you attended, or successful phone call you've made with a certain piece and once that's been achieved, that piece comes off the board.
0:44 WAIT HOW DOES SOMEONES SCREEN UPDATE THAT FAST?! (p.s. I know it’s fake)
This is a symbolic game of how society actually works. The checkerboard pattern is the symbol of duality. There has been and will always be the groups behind the scenes moving the pieces. All of our so called leaders in government that they parade around are just actors and pawns in the game like the rest of us.
GUYSSSSS, I made a mistake! I joined my school’s chess club (since I’m not really in any clubs or anything) but I’ve never even played chess once 😣🤪😂😂😂
😯
Yep, i got the wrong version of chess.
its very easy an
Me after I watch it: This tutorial is so helpful!  Me when I play: umm let me go get my phone
You can 100% capture a queen with your king. It’s hard but possible.
All my friends at school know how to play a chess... Everyone except me. That's why I'm here. Lol
рлплмд
sometime the board in the video looks like its upside down and not upside down
*checkmate*
I feel bad for people who don't know how to play chess, want to learn, but just can't seem to get it down. What I suggest is you get someone in real life to show you how to play. Another one is have someone who knows how to play walk you through as you play with them. If all else fails you can just play computer chess and it will show you what you can and cannot do.
11:06 I’ve never heard of that
Racists Game. Whites go first.  Kings of Europe vs Kings of  Africa.
noyhing  attracts  me   .   i  konw more   than   you    i  am   5th  class .  iam   my   mother son .  her  name is  shirisha  badugu  .  you can  make  vidios  like   who  invented   bag .
@4:40 he has 0 clue what he is saying 😂🤣😂🤣
I already now how to play chess
Spill the tea sis👌
What’s the aim of the game
This change my life I'm the school champion thanks bright side
I dont get why some people say bishop as 3 points but others say 3.5 points.
My crush said if I ever beat her in chess we can be together :)
Im a Asian so play another board game like this but it surprise me when the rule are the same thing as the one i play
I see in the example that the rook/tower sometimes jumps over players? That's not possible, right?
6:00 b horse lands in it your done queen can’t do anything
Thank you
A2 and H2 for pawns.
I’m in confusion at 2:25
I am master
I've played chess for years and this tutorial is boggling my mind. I don't think newer players need to know about the names of ranks and files. That alone is a bit misleading and unnecessarily complicates an already grossly complicated game. Naming the files and ranks is only necessary for theory or introducing rated play which beginners won't be doing for many months if not many years. Also, in one of your slides you suggest guarding the king at all times, which is true, however...you have the king guarded by impossible or illegal pawn positions on the back-rank, which again, is very misleading...since pawns can only move forward, not backwards.  The later bit about "winning strategies" is snake oil to me. There isn't such a thing without peeling back literally thousands of layers worth of opening, mid-game and end-game theory if we're to assume both players are at appreciable levels of experience. What you definitely don't want to do to a beginner playing chess is try to overly simplify this game, because that's not how it's played. Moves that can theoretically checkmate in 3-4 only work on the people watching this very tutorial.  Chess is one of those games where you can only teach the basics unfortunately. You can teach how pieces move, you can teach how to set the board, you can teach illegal and legal moves but that's essentially it. You can't teach tactics to beginners, you can't teach advanced positioning to beginners, you can't teach openings or very subtle elements that define the very core of this board game. That has to come with experience, preference and with a hands-on-approach.
Thank you bright side I just won a 100 pesos for winning 🤛🏻👌🤣🤑
Um, I’m just going to stick with checkers.
I’m lucky my crush is a chess player like me😂😖❤️
Who wants to play with me online?
The king can attack a queen if she gets too close without backup
You're so smart I got everything what time I did never I did never get to be my father you know play it but I will let you know whether we'll watch it I watch your videos to beat daddy ever know everything on this game😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
I learn so much but man his voice rubs me the wrong way.
I dont play chess but i was assigned to coach for girls chess and its like going on a war w/o any weapon..so I got interested and thought that chess is a game that excercise your mind.
It’s Very Confusing.
Ladder checkmate is my faivorite
all jokes aside bright-side doesn't just only make weird suicidal videos it actually helps us sometimes
Watching madly chess videos coz there is a tournament help me!!like if you want me to win  👇
Descubre el lado genial de la vida xdxdxd :v
who still play chess in 2019?  Likes if you do!
4:38 he means a2-h2 not a1-h1
Waaaaaaaaaay too basic
You missed something about castling. Not only can't the king be in check, but he can't castle through or into check either.
I cant really memorize the letters and numbers correspond. 🤗 hhehehe
"Your king should be properly protected at all times" Vassily Ivanchuk: *puts king on d4 in the middlegame*
Literraly Bright Side Every Piece is Important, Not Only The King
I thought there was a time limit to play the game.....
My cheakMate is cheakpoint😂😂😂😂
Did you meant A2 and H2 at 4:41?
How many of you paused the video and came to the comment section
I have chess tryouts today and I haven't played chess since fourth grade so this is super helpful!!
Just got a headache watching this... Still dont understand jack.
Hey can you think straight cause the problem is the rook queen and bishop

1:52 “the best thing about rooks” THATS THE ONLY THING ABOUT ROOKS
So smart!
My crush loves chess You know the reason why I'm here Edit: Im straight
Am I the only one or his king and queen were in wrong positions? 🤔
4:58 actualy in this case you can its called en passant
In the Philippines, that special pawn move is called "Pass Pawn"
I know this was a beginners guide and everything but i was hoping to learn something new. Can we maybe get a more advanced guide as well?
There are many moves of horse or knight
I need to join chess club
Before you play,  and win;  master these four things first: mathematics,  passion,  psychology,  and patience. And be sure your opponent understands;  if you lose you'll  throw a hissy-fit.
Black:Checkmate MAD White:Stalemate AHHH
play someone online use two windows, in one window the online game, and the other an expert level ai match, do your opponents moves in the ai and do what the ai does
Congrats me I am selected for DISTRICT level❤
You forgot change rock
“I was playing chess with my friend and he said, ‘Let’s make this interesting’. So we stopped playing chess.”

Thank you bright side now I've learned Chess
Who else knows how to play chess, is a bit good at it, but still watches these videos?
Thanks for the help of the game I really needed to understand the game of chess ♟
If he/she gets a queen u lose or
Yea I was confused after that
Yea I don’t get the check
Why is the king important??????
Why am I watching this if Im already a pro at it XD
Nothing beats the elongated horse move...
Most important is the queen?well for me its the king bec without the King I would’ve lost the game already
Bishop is not 3.5 points, it is 3 points. believe me, I play chess
THIS IS GREAT QUALITY - THANK YOU :)
You make me learn a lot about chess today
No need
Nah ill just learn from Askeladd  "Ur awesome if you get this"
Just to add a few things: 1. Don't make too many pawn moves in the opening.   2. You should avoid moving the same piece twice, in the opening. 3. You should have all your pieces developed with your King castled and rooks connected within 10-12 moves.   4. Look for undefended pieces.  5. If you're down material (pieces) avoid trades. 6. If you have a space advantage (meaning your pawns/pieces are further developed) avoid trades. 7. When attacking, an easy way to calculate if you can win that piece is, if attackers = defenders (2 attackers vs 2 defenders) you need another attacker.
What happened to stalemate.
Is anyone cringed by the board not being proper
plz subscribe my youtube chanell i am posting videos to make ppl pro in chess...i am posting videos from.most basic to most intermediate level of chess plz watch my video
Don't make sense
it makes the  brain shaper
Useful to when my dad got me a chess board from his Friend for FREE
I love the rock tarket that move is NOT a option to survive😂😂
7:10 WRONG! Bishops are worth 3 points, not 3.5 points!
I have played chess a long time... just started teaching people... Here are a couple of good pointers... 1) Always trade up... if you can't trade for a higher value piece, don't trade. 2) Try to threaten a piece on every move, if it's safe...  this prevents them from doing whatever they want and allows you to control the next move. 3) Watch what they do.  If they move a piece, figure out WHY before you decide your next move.  Most strategies require 3 to 5 moves to pull off.   There are more but I'm tired of thinking about chess today.
11:54 The rooks escape the chess board!
7:15 the bishop is 3 points not 3.5  It's 3.5 only when you have a bishop pair in open positions so two bishops will equal to 7
usally im a PRO i just watched it to teach my OLDER sister.  BUT IM 11 AND IM A...PILIPINO LIKE AT MAG SUBSCRIBE PARA SA MGA PILIPINO
This is the most idiotic music for a video about how to play chess.
4:39 "from A2 to H2".
Good! I can use these tips if I can join the Intramurals at my school...
Just letting you know, there is another rule in castling. While you castle, if a king passes through a move the would be check if put there, you can’t castle. In other words, if I castle through a queen that is blocking a space in between my rook and king, it cant castle.
9:47 HACKER
I’m not even planning on playing chess anytime soon, i just really want to understand at least a bit about this witchcraft
Me:all the moves are ingrinded in my head like Castleing
Uhm 2:01 that pawns placement is illegal
I play chess !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9:50 the rook hops over the bishop Illegal
My friend: Dude, let's play  Me: Yes  8 mins later.....  Me: Checkmate  My friend: How did you checkmate me?  Me: I am an expert of chess  My friend: How did you move a piece like pawns, castles, horses, bishops, queen and king?  Me: I just learned how to play chess
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
A mistake out there. King is more important piece piece on the board
9:16 I thought the best move was 1.f3 followed by 2.g4 no?
I already know how to play chess, but I learned a lot of things from this video 😃
When he was showing the rook the pawn reached the end and should have been promoted
Although I haven't read every comment, I do have a question. Am I the only one who caught the mistake about the pawns? The narrator states that the pawns go in the positions of A1 through H1, when in fact the video shows them going into A2 through H2. I'm, A1 through H1 is reserved for the major pieces, not the pawns. Talk about your Freudian slip. LOL.
Bright side thank you for making video for chess!
Sometimes I read the some people's comments on Youtube videos making me want to know them in person and become friends with them.
This person never mentioned zugzwang!!!
Bright side : If you touch a piece you must move it  Me : Touches 2 pieces   LOGIC 1000
9:33
ITS A LIE! The queen and king switch places at the beginning of the game. The queen starts on a space the opposite of her color.
I thought it was useful. Then I saw bright side. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Why am i watching this...
When am black my first move is c4
Actually  the King can attack the queen
I always loosed but now it actually helped
I've been playing Chess for 5 years now. There is another endgame thing called the ''Stalemate". The Stalemate occurs when the player whose turn it is to move is not in check, but can't make a move without putting the King in check. Then the game ends as a draw or tie.
I'm just 8 and know all of this.I'm like an expert in chess.Duhhhhhhhh
And bishops are useful in open position
Nights are useful in closed positions
Bishop's point is only 3not 3.5
I am a advanced player not a begginer
Well I guess I can beat you bright side
I hate chess
You are a chess noob some of the moves you sad is not a thing you can you do and you forgot about the swap play. Were you can swap to pieces but there need to next to each other for it to work
Your mother promise like here
You tell me everything  right now I’m learning
I got so confused at 6:20
We stan a feminist board game 😄 like if you get this!
Shogi gang?
WHEN YOU FRIEND WHISPER YOU AND HE SAID I WILL MOVE MY PON SO I CAN GET HER QUEEN AWAY ME:I CAN HELP YOU FRIEND:REALLY? ME:OFC *GETS HER PHONE AND THEN THROW IT AT THE BOARD*
we have chess titans on our laptop and a chess inrealaif
Um.... the king is the most important piece because you need to protect him
I use mah horse to capture rooks
Do you actually have to say “check” when the King’s in check?
4:39   Do you mean A2-H2 for white
The bishop is the letter X
I HAD TO WATCH THIS SINCE OUR INTRAMURAL GAMES IS THIS FRIDAY AND IM PART OF THE CHESS!!!!
If you move a D pawn, then black moves an E pawn one. Then the king’s diagonal is opened which makes him weak and the queen or bishop might aim at the king since they both can move diagonal
Who else is a grandmaster at chess and is just watching this for fun?
Magnus Carlsen has left the chat
I have chess on my phone
I'm a Advanced Person on chess but I still watch these so I can be better!
What???  Pawns are from a1  to h1? Hahaha
1.25x speed    Your welcome
“A cool intellectual”😂😂
Very clear introduction.  Well done!
No Game No Life.
I *USED* to use chess to cut classes
0:15 Cue the roast.
Chess history includes some attempts into introducing new pieces, one of them was the "aeroplane" in the early 1900s, this piece was able to move over your own or rival's pieces (like an airplane); it has all the movement as the Queen. The "aeroplane" piece did not have its own column, you were able to promote one of your pawns when reaching the rank before promoting!   The other piece was the minister, it combined all the Queen's movements plus the knight, making it the only piece able to deliver un-assisted check-mates; the "minister" piece sat between the "King and Queen", so adding an extra column to the chess board.
Non sense vid from bright side.
I know how to play chess but not that good!!!!
I have always wanted to learn this
Lol knight and bishop have same point
d4
2019?
Is there a rule that you can undo the moves .because every time I checkmate him he undo the moves
D1 and D8 should be kings
5:54 is not checkmate but stalemate
i want to play im a bigginer
always update me okay
Thx for the guide
12:52
10:45 and 34:56 lol
Bro make more vedios plz
Do you have  arabic bright side cuz my dad dont know how to play chess he don't know English can u please give for my father
Bishops and knights are worth equal btw, it is true that the bishops are generally more powerful than knights but they are considered equal pieces since sometimes a knight in a position is way more efficient than a bishop.
7:17 liar the bishop is 3 points
can pawn checkmate the king
Thank u for all ur guidance. It really helped me as a beginner
I play chess
9:46 what is that change?
I even learnt how to play chess. Ain't it a exciting adventure this life is?
I know how to play but im self thought so i didnt learn the swich thingie

0:42 “but before we get into all the the tails”
Did anybody notice,Bright Side has more subs than Imagine dragons?
Omg the example game was so bad
3:40 I would rather say the most powerful than the most important (the latter one is the king, of course)
I came here because I read that YouTube has made chess learning apps obsolete. Where? I want a program that tells me what my best and worst moves would be for every move.
Complicated
Do you know chess to the world is given by India and I am proud that I am indian
I haven't played since second grade, so I need to look back in how to play!
you forgot to tell everyone what a stalemate is in chess
So you are now a decent chess player? Me:Yes? What did cost? Me: Watching a bright Side video
Outstanding move
can't castle through check either
Clciked off as soon as it said BRIGHT SIDE
3:35 racist!
Here cuz of the movie fresh💯😂
Your directions are too vague.
I will anti subscribe your channel is boring
4:40 : you mean A2-H2
4:41 A2 - H2, i think you mean
Thank you, very informative
This was very useful to me.
Actually a bishop is 3 points and a knight is worth 3 1/2  points and a queen is worth Ten. And actually your king is the most important piece, the Queen is the most powerful piece. so be careful not to lose her.
THANKYOU
how about for advance 😂
Brain.exe not found for such task
7:27 horse Is better then bishop
I bet my friends 5 times
BORING!
I'm a master at playing chess
now watch witch alya zomba dance
Minister not queen
Anyone else interested because of the chess game that was on your laptop and u always pressed anything
*this is bold text* _this is italic text_ -this is strikethrough- this is normal       *THIS IS AMERICA*
How do you build?
12:25 you can’t castle either if there is an enemy piece attacking one of the squares where the castle would take place (sorry if the word choice isn’t correct)
I love chess! Such a beautiful game
Thanks a lot for sharing the basic lesson. Because of you I just won the expert level in the chess app which I difficulty since days.
Thx a lot u though me how to play chess omg thxxx Love u a lot ❤️🥰  I subscribed and liked the video  Hope u like my comment and Bright side can u plzz like my comment and comment down below and others also like and comment plzz  Like 👇🏻if u like bright side and don’t forget to comment   ❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰😊
I hate bright side because it shows many fake things
What I watch at 3am
I’m trying to learn how to play this so I can play with my boyfriend:)
Someday this will be one of the oldest 10% of all comments.
3:35 xD
We love our black and white queens 😏 lol
SICIILLIAN DEFENSE e4 c5

Thanks for this awesome video Bright Side. ❤️❤️❤️
You also can't Castle through squares that are under attack
I just posted a challenge to the chess community on my channel.  Anyone that can name the Opening/Mate in my last video will win a free ITUNES giftcard and featured in my next video... good luck
Made it to 0:41 paused it. typed a comment about how lame this guy sounds then found a new video.  this dude sounds more lame then a kid in a wheelchair.
I like chess I'm a chess player kid I got in chess three 1first places I am pro i want to be a chess grand master
The best way to actually learn the game is to play real human beings
It's basically the same thing as checkers I mean...people if you don't see it then look up the similarities
tf is this background music lol
I am good chess player
*Legends say they once promoted a king into a pawn*
I love chess! I know how to play it somewhat, but I know people that can play it better than me. Chess sure is a fun game to play! I love it!
My son has been playing for 6 years now and he's good at it
I love your channel
Hi
Yeah, I need to get back into this game. Warhammer 40k is kids stuff compared to this gane.
Oooohhhhhh 😳 He called it a "Horse" 🤬🤬🤬🤣
Wt I’m a grandmaster I’m only 11
This has to be the 2nd worst chess instructional video ever....
Kights are the only one who can defeat the  queen.
You forget that you cant Castle if enemy pieces van go between the rock and king in one move
Good but display chess also
Sir i want to know how to make such videos i want to make chess videos in hindi language
I am the beginner today I bought a board REALLY!
Viking chess is better
It is very good
I like it, I want to learn right now
No gueen is not  9 it's 8
Imagine being horrible enough to be consentrating on the video
I learn chess by watching  your  video
thaqif
why does the player with white peices start first? its not fair (someone could even call it racist). they should do rock paper scissors to decide who goes first.
i wanna be a god not a pro
Pls tell e
Can u pls tell me that if we r starting with pawns how many moves should go forward and Simply playing with pawns that is all the pawn can move forward with 2 moves from its original place
Soo try me
I won a metal on a tournament
I love learning chess it is the best
I'm just learning how to play but at time 4:40 into the video, shouldn't it be that the pawns take up ranks "A-2 through H2 and A-7 through H-7"?  The video states "A-1 through H-1 and A-7 through H-7".  I'm already lost but I think that I understood A-1 through H-1 are occupied with the rooks, knights, bishops, queen and king.
I'm still new to chess. I can't seem to checkmate for the life of me, why is it so hard! It's so frustrating to lose against a level 1 CPU on Chess online or at the very best tie with it! I try my best but I don't seem to get any better. Any help with strategies on how to start a game of chess?
I’m not a begginer
How to play chess:   ♟ Pawn: you get 8 pawn pieces. They are located at the front row as the small pieces. The first ever move you make with all those piece, you can choose to move forward one space or 2. But only on the first move of every pawn.   Rooks: you get 2 rookies. These are located in the corners of the board. They look like a castle. These pieces can be moved as far as you want front, back,right,left but never diagonal.   Knights: you get 2 knights. knights are located right next to the rook piece. These look like horses. With this you can move one square one way and then 2 squares another way.   Bishop: you get 2 bishops. Bishops are next to the knights. This piece has a slit in the top. It kind of looks like a frown (opposite to a smile).   The queen: you get 1 queen. The queen is located next to the bishop on any side (I say any because you’re other opponent has to place their queen on the opposite bishop to theirs so that the queens aren’t aligned). The queen is the second tallest piece so you can’t miss it. The queen is important because it can go ANY direction as FAR as it wants. This is a useful piece.  The king: you get 1 king. The king is located next to your queen. Usually has a cross at the top of your piece. This piece you MUST protect at all cost. If your king gets taken, you loose. The king can only move 1 space any direction. Making it very vulnerable.   You are allowed to cross over your pieces with the knights and rooks (but some people don’t allow rooks to be crossed over your pieces because it makes your rook a bit overpowered). For the other pieces you can not just ‘jump over/cross over’ another piece.   Take out your opponents king.
Bishops are 3 points not 3.5
I like chess 😊
thanks!
It’s knight not horse
I wanna play chess because of the “check mate” in a intimidating voice
Who already knows how to play chess but still came here.
wow i learned  now and i get it thx
OK don't waste too much time on chess I mean because it is dangerously time consuming and other people who want to play it can get you in a trap. If you play the computer, One way a beginner can try is Chess Spark - Cody was the first player and he is ridiculously easy to beat. Claire is so and so and intermediate. Boris is the hard one and I beat him a few times in the days I played a bit a few years ago for sure and tied him on others although he is difficult. I could not play the guru or the killer one because you have to pay for the pack, although tried battle chess where there are two levels, easy and hard. That is a challenging one and I won both several times in the days      Another one is play against the computer levels 1-10 look that up. Level 1 is very easy and the first 3 are not tough with practice and only take some time to win. The fourth level I tied although gets much more challenging and you have to devote time. Chess is bad for me because if I log on to play on the computer at night after work in the bedroom on the computer its already 4 in the morning and I lose track of the time and go off schedule. I only have to work at 2 although it screws up the schedule although maybe I should play in the morning instead. A game of bridge takes like 5 minutes to win if youre lucky though these games may not give the same mental exercise. Wheel of fortune can be fun to play but for me it is so easy I get nothing out of it and other players on the computer choose letters that are a terrible choice. Computer chess players can be too good though they can consume your life
Nice game
check this chess tee ------> https://society6.com/product/keep-moving-forward1992704_t-shirt?sku=s6-10807513p15a4v75a5v20a11v49
You can play the computer although its not an easy way to start. Try the easy levels and then move up although I do not like chess because it is corrupt - it takes a tedious long time to have to make a move and in more difficult levels it just gets ridiculous. If you want to try a brain exercise I recommend something else, however not chess. It gets too tedious and patronizing and competitive in sometimes a no good way with others
🚰✔️
At 5:46 the setup was a stale mate not a check mate. Since it would be blacks turn because white must had just made that move the the rules dictate that the king cannot put himself in check, so as sad as it is nobody would win in a stale mate.
you are boss
No castling
U CANT SEE ME THROUGH DEEZ MAD SHKILLZ
I want fighting
King safety;surround your king with pawns  Me:...
But you can have 9 queens if you get all of your pawns to the other side of the chessboard.
4:26 If your not in to lose to a smothered mate, you shouldn’t really make a pawn-wall as shown.
im already good at chess thou
You are checking the comments to see if chess is easy.
instructions unclear  got arrested for planning to assasinate the king
Bishop is valued 3, and not 3.5 points.
error at 04:39  please fix it.
This game is similar to a war.
It reminds me of a battlefield
Chess is a pretty cool guy.
Its over 2000 years ago.
This game is very old.
So lelouch
What ever happened to white on the right    every thing related too white is races   i guess
Don’t forget that if the only 2 peaces left are kings the match is a draw
Castling move confirmed
I saw that
I call the rook a castle
Me after watching this video  Me:WHAT?
Who is rated player here?
https://youtu.be/fki_FYLwjTo subscribe and reply done and I'll return the favor
I knew chess
I'm not a beginner but I'm very bad
Why is the pawn is in a1 and h1
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😊😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄 Find 😊
FINNALY I CAN PLAY CHESS!! 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
1:40
National Tournament Player here. Ranked in the 98th percentile, Class-A.   2:02 I see a pawn on a promotion square; that's illegal. There are worse visuals further in the rest of the video so I won't elaborate further. 3:40 Wrong statement; The Queen is NOT the 'most important piece on the board", the King is. 6:15 Wrong statement; You don't have to say 'check to your opponent. Tournament rules. 6:49 Wrong statement; Your King cannot move to a square that your opponent's piece can move a piece to on the next move. That'll place your King in check and is illegal.  7:16 Wrong statement; A bishop is worth 3 points. It is disputed to be worth 3.5 because of its endgame strength but it is NOT officially 3.5, as stated in the FIDE rules. 7:21 Wrong statement; It calculates the 'material value', but not centipawn advantage. Centipawn advantage determines who is winning, not material advantage. 12:25 Missing statement; In check, there is a 'line of fire' rule, wherein between squares transversed by the King to castle cannot be under attack by the opponent's pieces.  Missing statements; Forgot to mention about Stalemates and draws.    There are so many other wrong technicalities, but these are the major, undisputed ones I've pointed out. Overall, this video is a horrible video to watch if you want to learn Chess, as it gives too many misconceptions.
Thanks for teaching me how to play "Chess".
I started  on this Christmas (2018) and I really liked it so I hoped to learn some ga few good moves and I did learn a few tips
Bishap is 3 not 3.5
Can you make more chess videos not for begginers
Thanks bro
Ok i'm downloading chess right now 😂
4:41 Come on. That's wrong. It's actually a2 to h2. 5:17 Just say that the capturing piece is one space diagonally forward. 6:16 You are NOT ALLOWED to. 7:15 Um, the bishops' strategies score is 5.
Chess is intriguing and provoke thinking.
This guy's the voice of *How's It Made*
Just cheking if u are correct and yup
You must be good at something else than rather begging help for your queen just in case your queen gets captured     (Sorry for the wrong or bad grammar )
If only this sport had cheerleaders, it would be perfect!
I was more confusied than before
Superb
4:26 HOW CAN PAWNS BE AT THE BACK???
why does he sound like wilford warfstasch ?
11:38 when you promote the panw when does it go
00:17 😂😂
Bruh why does he says details like that lol must be how they say it wherever he grew up.
After that I still do not know how to play.
INSTANT HEADACHE
Thank u for this guide today I got interested in chess but didn’t know how to play it this guide is so helpful New chess players or beginners should watch this
This reminds me of a war
Pawns are in row A1 to H1 huh?
Nice  It works
Thanks,it was the best video for learning chess.👍
I lile dcks
Technically, the Knight isn't the only piece that can jump another. Rooks can as well, but only when Castling. The Queen isn't the most "important", just the most powerful. The King is of the highest importance, since a mate results in end of game. White Pawns were shown on the right Rank, (2), but announced as Rank 1. Another limitation of Castling is that the King cannot move THROUGH a guarded position to perform it, let alone being in check (like mentioned) or completing the move and resulting in being checked (mentioned, and not allowed). Aside from those small notes, this is a fantastic introduction to the game. Complex and challenging.
Thx you very much!!!
Outstanding move
Wrong Knight has 3.5. Knight and Bishop has same value man
anyone who really wants to learn chess the right way, just lookup Chess Antics
I love Chess
I am a intetmediate already im just celebrating
The king points is 0.. I dont know if im right or wrong.. Pls reply me if im right or wrong.
Still dont get it
hmmm white goes first i smell...racism XD nah JK
A... different video
Thank you sir i got it
My notes: Knights can jump, and is the only one who can jump. King needs protection at all times. Losing him loses the game.
I give up.....I will never understand this game...
I love to play chess but I am loser but thanks for teaching such great tricks....  I love chess Hit a like...😄
😭 this is my reaction after watching this
Thanks for this video- I have a chess competition next week and totally forgot how to play it
I’m learning for a girl
Patient
I haven't played Chess for ages, so I've lost practice, I may not have been paying attention to this video, I am a daydreamer.
This video sucks.
Looks hard to learn
i want to play cheese but these apere
thank you
Cheesy and woeful american voiceovers 😷
my son saw this and set up a chess of his own i thought it was funny
I already know that all, but see it for more possibilities to improve myself.
I wonder why people don’t recognize Chess as a sport. It was a sport since 2000
Bright side, I challenge u to play with me 😎😎
A little laugh a 2:15
can your king move through check when castling?
Tricks are for kids. Horrible. Terrible.
raceist lol jk
Thanks that helped a lot
Thank you so much
Most important piece is The King
Chest is rasis only the whites are allowed to go first
Thanks
I'm playing chess
Why am I watching this at 11pm when I already know how to play chess.
Why can't the black pieces go first? Smh
im a pro in chees in cheat way
7:25 WRONG Bishop is also 3 points
WOW
4:39 says pawns take the row a1 to h1 despite video showing a2 to h2.
2:03 why can't the rook go right
Perfect!!! I was going show my sis how to play!!!
Who else is a chess master here??
I have a how to play Chess video on my channel. Please view. It has no views. I would like to grow. I made it yesterday. Thank you everyone.
Hey Never underestimate a pawn it can promote 😏
Your tip “foresee your enemy’s movement” was the tip a teacher at school I was playing with taught me. The other tip was “ Don’t go for the king FIRST. He can be targeted after a few officials (bishop, knight, and rook) have been captured.
Thanks for this. Will probably send it to a friend. One thing I would suggest for a future video, is making it clearer that you do not *have* to catch en passant; even though you did say you "can" catch, I think that many people might not understand that they do not have to. Another note is that the Knight is *not* also called a "horse".
oh my god. Honestly how much time did it take to make this video?? U must be a legend
I am first in chess this is best game
4:41 h1 to a1 or h2 to a2?
Completely omits the basic objective for each player and goes straight to why moves won't work.
I have III category
this game is sexist
I love it but very difficult
How many times should I watch this before I set out to play chess. I've watched it twice now. Plan on watching 3 more times. Yes, I am slow    Lol
I am already a international master rating 2232
6:55 black forgot to check the white
I have been playing chess since I was 5
chess is awesome!!!!!
Teach sacrifice
Chess is racist White pieces move first
Fake
THINK ABOUT IT
4:41 he said a1 to h1 instead of a2 to h2
Just came here to confirm that i was playing correctly all theses years and yes i have been
my best strategy is the bishop and the horse im good at using horse that day i win with only horses xD
9:48 white king and white rook cheated
Dear Brightside, 4.40, you're welcome  Love you
Rt
W
8:14 no they are strongest in the middle of the board.
4:40 Bright Side: a1 to h1 me: bruh, a2 to h2
6:16 No, you must not say check in a serious chess game. Only say check when you're playing fun with your friend.
A mistake was made when explaining pawns stating position. White pawn line up on a2 to h2 not a1 to h1 as shown
Bruh its impossible to use a ton of pawns for check mate and put it in  1 side and sometimes checkmate is not the end of the game there is Stale mate too and KNIGHTS ARE THE MOST USEFUL PIECE FOR CAPTURING QUEENS
4:43 pawn a2-h2
2:10 check😂
I taught many people chess but I am watching this
All my queens are black 😤
at my school next yer when i am a yer for i am gana be in the schools chess tame cos i am so good and not cos of you bright side
The second sentence gave me terminal 89
Hello lam the GM in the chess
Any longtime players have tips for a newbie
WHHHY DOES CHESS NEEED SO MUCH RULESSSS
Bishop and knight is both 3 points not 3.5 points
Chess is a good game of reflexion so i want to learn who to play this game and became why not a champion
Is it just me or it said that pawns are from row A1 to H1 for one player?
Wrong the white pawns are on a2 to h2 not a1 and h1 like you said
Chess is cool but looking at the broader family of games is even more interesting. If you want to see "pawn promotion" but in steroids and not only applicable to pawns, look up Shogi. Comparing these two is just brilliant
I wanna learn how to play because some kids in my school are marking a chess. Club and my friends wanna join one of them have an idea of how to play and the other one knows and loves playing chess but I dont
For me chess makes my problems forget
Im playing chess at school
My friend thinks chess is racist... because of the black and white pieces... and that white goes first....
4:40 “They take the rows for A1 to H1”  I think you meant: “They take the rows for A2 to H2”
I mean this wouldn't count as a beginners guide and more of just a how to play because it covers no real strategies and doesn't really tall about actual openings but for a how to play it is fine
my knights create checks
At 4:40 pawns placed in A2 to H2 but he is saying A1 to H1 ?
At 4:40 something is wrong
At 4:40 pawns placed in A1 to H1 or A2 to H2 ?
Love it💕💕💕💕💕
Need some clarification, only the first move of any pawn can move forward two squares, right?
Did you forget about castling and the king can get in check
Chess: Discovered in India
How about the passpon
3:40 the queen is not the most important piece on the board its the king
In my school your chess level = your popularity level
9:46 why did the rook can change with the queen?
Note : The Knight  and bishop CAN value equally 3points,depending on the position.  Edit: you cant castle if there is an enemy pieces who can travel or pointing or blocking the way of the king or rook
7:15 the bishop is 3 points too
4:29 SMUTHERED CHECKMATE LOLOL
U
Chess has always been my favorite game and it always will be
it's really awesome >> i liked the voice of the speaker
Visual politik theme music
Hi pls. Like cause me is lonely
No i do not have to say out loud "check". It's considered to be a thing that amateurs do.   A chess player is expected to look after his king. Not moving out of the check is an illegal move but it would be the "crime" of my opponent not mine.
it has helped me a lot
Good in theory, have you played the master level?
You forgot the rule about castling queen side.
Wow so thankful for showing me how to Play chess
You cant castle at your oppenent's turn
Bishop and Knight both equal points. That was misleading to say 3.5 they are all valued at 3. The Knight is stronger in closed positions and Bishops in open positions
The Queen is the strongest not most important. The king is the most important.
The rook cannot take at 2:24, but the pawn can lol
Lol why am I watching this video
Jdhdkhdiebrhdbfkekshs.   Noob
I cant believe I mix the king and queen up
Never play f6
psst you can't tell check in a tournament,
how bout the king moving through check, or ya know  moving check? ok I'll just castle into check and break the rule never put your king in check
can only move 2 squares, how about moving him one square
ya know someone has won, by sacrificing their queen willingly
the centre of he board is pretty much the best spot for all peices
peice points don't judge the game, it's the position on the board
so you telling me to not put your king in check, in he stupidest way possible
WHY would you ever have triple pawns, and you can't even have pawns there, the one on he edge can't get there
Also you can never capture the king, nor take it as you said it, you must checkmate there you go and even then he can't be captured, it's just game ovet
captured peices on her way, so I can capture their queen on the first row
each player should have a dark square in the bottem left, doesn't apply, white needs do be on 1 and 2, where as black has to be on 7 and 8
ok move dpawn and epawn in the same turn, make sure I highlight the D and E when I do it
i love chess and i always beat my dad in it thanks for the few extra tips!

Hi the 0ne who is reading you are smart  Please subscribe my channel you wont loose anything
Freaking *NERDS*
Chess doesn't like me I don't like chess, is the hardest game in the world. My friend love chess his the master of chess. He try to teach me but I still don't understand chess well just a little. I have a lot of catching up to do. As for myself I'm the master of scrabble I beat him all the time so we are equal!!
In fact, if your phone makes a sound in a tournament you will lose immiediatly
The bishop's and the knight's value depends on the position.
Bishops have 3 points
I don't know why I'm here I already know how to play chess since 5 months ago
I'm a pro at chess already
Jesus raping Christ... Don't try to learn chess from this video. 4 minutes in, and there's already been one HUGE mistake... The queen isn't the most important piece on the board, the king is. You can win without the queen, as it's not required to mate. It's just the strongest piece, but that doesn't make it more important then the king.
First time hearing that knights and bishops differ in value
I still dont get saying check out loud
Pawns are A2 not A1
5:50 that is a stalemate not a checkmate. Stalemate is when a player can't move any piece and his king is not in check so the game is drawn.
This was on my to do list to learn to play chess
Thanks
Can you find the diffrence easy 😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯 😯😯😯😯😯😯😯☺😯😯😯😯 😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯  Can you find the diffrence medium 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😀😀😀😀  can you find the diffrence hard ⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳ ⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳ ⏳⏳⏳⏳⌛⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳
Do u need to be adept at math? I almost don’t even want to try 😕
The most rubbish video ever!
The night looks like Snooki
3:15 rook???? or do you mean bishop
2:19 the white pong is pointing on the king queen or any back piece
in rook
I want to win because i all Ways lose
4:39. Erratum: 'a2 to h2' instead of 'a1 to h1'
...yup, still don't get it
yeah
Horrible graphics, this is supposed to be for beginners, so at least lay the board flat so they can easily see the pieces and their squares
1 thing you forgot about castling is that none of the squares the king moves through can be threatened either
thanks
Thanks! Very well explained. :)
U left 1 rule in castling that is in the path which King passes enemy piece should not control those two squares
I am good in chess and Rubik cube ...... Why I am not good in studies ... What's wrong with it?
2:13 this pawn on B1 makes me cringe so hard
I want to be a Chess Master.
What about draw rules ? Also u can't castle if the opponent's piece  is occupying  F.1,G.1,B.1,C.1,D.1 and the eight rank for black.
You can understand chess principles in 5 minutes but to became better at it it can take  your whole time life
4:40 he made a mistake,he said that the pawns for white takes over a"1" to h"1", but its on a2 to h2  i just wanna say it although its just a small mistake
KING is the most important piece on the board not the queen
They didn't tell any draw rules..  1. If your king is not in check but it has no possible square to go to then it's a stalemate(this only applies when your other pieces doesn't have any moves either or you only have your king left) 2. If checkmate is impossible due to lack of material then it's a draw 3. If you and your opponent makes the exact same move(thrice), then, it's also a draw..  4. 50 move rule 5. If you or your opponent accept a draw
I want to be a cool intellectual
Thos video not even explain about ENPASANT, and CASTLING which most player dont know
How to be not nervous in a competition????
When showing where the pawns go on the board, the narrator made a huge mistake - He said the white ones go on " A 1 ".   He should have said A 2, right?   At 4:40.
I can't believe i am advance and still watching this, but I learned on thing.
The most important piece is the King. The Queen is the most powerful.
in school I got second place
Can i slap my playmate if he is almost to my king? You said protect😂  Ps: this is a joke
VERY HEPLFULL THX
Thank you this was very helpful and informative 👍👍
7:16, wrong, Bishops also have 3 points worth of value
Super
Cousin:let’s play chess  Me:ok gimme a sec  Me: *watches intensely*
the first 30 seconds is really cringy
U explained the move en passant wrongly.....it can happen on any square with the pawn
See this very good video https://youtu.be/42m7dCxMzx8
I didnt learn a thing
Bad music at front
So the queen is fighting but the king isn't? #lazyking

Chess is my fav. Sport I have got 6 trophies I am saying the truth god promise
Chess!
This video is excellent for anybody who is a beginner  in chess and wants to learn all the rules....Thank You Bright Side for this video it helped me learn the basics in a jiffy!
Are there any games that you can download from App Store that will help teach a complete newbie how to play chess?? If so, any recommendations?? Thanks in advance 😊  This old dog is trying to learn new tricks 😜
King is also valued as 3.5
Bishop and knights value is sustained by the number of pawns in the board. If their are a lot of pawns, knights are more valuable. If there few, bishops are the way to go. And became pawns usually end up being gobbled up in the endgame, Bishops are rated higher; not to mention the bishop pair status.
Why do the white pieces move first?
I’m a superstar at chess
Thank you very much
4:38 pawns on a1 and h1
Another tip:the knight is the best piece to use against the queen scince the knight can take out the queen in 1 move while the queen requires 2(in most cases)
Thanks for tricks
Guys if u want to be a pro in chess watch more vids of chess and it works now im a pro in chess
Just a tip -   The value of pieces don't just depend of the piece alone, it depends on the situation they're in. For example, a good knight that controls good squares(?) is better that a rook that's trapped within his own pieces. Another example is by sacrificing your queen to get a better position. Who knows, you could get it back after a few moves and by looking ahead!
I like chess so much  yayyyyyyyy! I did into now anpansont
I was having dinner with a chess champion the other night at a Italian restaurant, the table that had a checkered tablecloth and  it took him 2 hours to pass me the salt  😏
I just got a chess ad before this video
Awsome
*Watches one video on how to play chess and then proceeds to defeat the World Chess Champion*
Actually the king is the most important piece
Amazing
4:39 Did you find a mistake there?
I like the approach to teach the game via animation. 😎 A few useful points to note: 1. Regarding the board orientation...there's a catchy phrase for the corner square, "light on right". 2. Announcing "check" when you give check to your opponent is not a rule. 3. There is one additional rule regarding castling...You cannot "castle through check" (i.e. if black guards f1, white cannot castle to his/her right [kingside])
Actually there is a rule that haven't been mentioned.  The king can't be in check when it is in the ending position and the square that the king passes can't be attacked.
2:05 the pawn can’t be on the last rows
THE KING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PEACE ON THE BOARD
My sis ia a champion in it and she is only 5
Can you being me ches
i really love chess
Wow, this is great 👍👌
Nice !
I already know how to play chess
bishops arent 3.5 they are 3 points. The only reason why they are 7 points combined is because they can checkmate the king just by the two of themselves
I love to play chess its so fun when beat all your opponents. Challege me at lichess torrejosjames.
Castling move
Wow, never heard of this “en passant” move. Neither saw it in any game :/
Now I am a pro
Hey bright side, want a game with me on chess.com? haha it will be fun. any 2000 rated players here?
At 3:39, Queen is the most powerful chess piece, while King is the most important chess piece.
some tips from a long time chess player 1) use all of your pieces, dont leave a knight or bishope to rott in a corner , try to use them all  2) dont move your king , moving your king out of the 1st / 8th row before late game is a bad idea , simple pawns can put you in check and then all you can do is defend 3) dont just move all pawns forward , keeping a few in their starting position or on your half of the board  4) a personal thing , but try to never lose bishopes , a well placed bishope can take a rook if the oponent doesnt realize he is opening a diagonal path , and another thing , a bishope can prevent pawns from moving since you can keep control over a diagonal row , you can prevent a protection wall ( 1 pawn protecting the other) from being made  5) use knights aggressively and try to fork the enemy , either by going between the enemy king and rook , or if possible king and queen , the oponent has to move the king and you get a 5 / 9 pawn value piece for free ( or at worst , you trade a 3 point knight for it ( and unlike bishopes where the strength lies in having both alive , losing 1 knight for a higher value piece always is worth it 6) if you have 2 bishopes in late game you can always force the enemy king into a corner , simply by moving one bishope at a time diagonally to force the king to move into the only direction ( left / right ) or even put him in checkmate if he gets trapped in a pawn corner / wall  7) for weak oponents , try trading queens , many new players use the queen in late game due to her covering half the board if she stands in the middle , especially if you know how to play well with knights and bishopes 8) with knights its important to think 3-5 steps ahead , if you move it out of your rows , think about where you could make a fork , where to bait pawns to losen the enemy lines of defense ( sometimes i just move both knights around after having a middle opening to prevent the enemy from making a stonewall opening for example ( for example , make the enemy move the d7 Pawn to d5 with a knight , retreat , then move the other one to d4 to force another pawn to move ( if the enemy ignores this you have a knight right in front of their base and will sooner or later get a fork opportunity 9) try to keep both rooks for the end game , rooks are easy for checkmate . you just need to force the king to the last row , block the row in front with 1 rook and then  put him in check with the other

Greetings from R.Gohkul!     I wishes thanks to this channel for this video
oh wow..now i can challenge Magnus Carlson after watching this video. 😑
This video was posted yesterday witch is the first day I started to my chess camp
You forgot to say when you move a pice and your hand lets go of that pice you have done you're move and you can't re-do you're move if you just saw a different move that you should of done but if you move you're pice put it on a different square and hold it you haven't completed you're move you can move you're pice back as long as you haven't let go and you can choose a different pice.
Bright side what about stalement
Love how you basically gabe up the knight at ~10:30 :D
I’m rated 1115
I can checkmate a lot of players using scholars mate
objection :  for casting should not the squares that king move not be in check
How to play fortbite....      It's fortnite not fortbite
Slight slip up, the pawns start on row 2 and 7 not 1 and 7
you mistakenly said that pawns for white player stand from a1 to h1, instead of 2, but you made really good video, i would definitely understand chess after watching this, good job :)
This incorrect on how to check somebody
It actually doesn't sound very complicated.
I'm an Indian Chess player
The king also can't castle through check.
A bishop is actually 3 points or sometimes 3.25 points.
What's your rating guys (mine is 1722)

Can a tower be a queen by upsidedowning it bright side?
Thnx for enhancing my chess technics and happy 14 million subscribers🎉🎉
Nice
Why can't black pieces go first? Is this racism??
Chess is a great game, I played a 2 hour and 30 minute game and I had a headache for the next few days. A very fun game none the less.
I want a chess Luke on no game no life
You forgot en passant
9:37 why not play Nxe4. Getting you a pawn, and after any non threatening move play d5 giving you a strong center?
When did bishops become 3.5 points?? It depends entirely on the nature of the position whether bishops or knights are better. They’re both 3.  Also, pawn phalanxes are better than chains. You control more space and the pawns are ready to advance when the time is right. Chains also make outposts that enemy pieces will usually occupy.  Also, it’s not always best to promote to a queen. Sometimes under promotion (promoting to something that’s not a Queen) helps gain tempi in things like the lasker trap. (Note for new players: don’t play traps they usually get you in worse positions if your opponent plays even halfway decently. I just happened to know this one involved an under promotion in some variations so I mentioned it)
Bishop 3.5????? Lol
Awesome bright side you are one of my fave channel for getting information and most of the time when i have questions and try to get the ans in your channel and now i have chess compitition of interschool and u make the vid today totally amazing
kings can take queens if a lone queen moves right next to the king.
I know how to play chess but I want to see some tricks...
I  like  this  game
Sade.com
This was amazing now I could checkmate most people
Yes im a master at chest i allways win
H 1 to A1?
I watch the video              AND I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY CHESS!
a bishop is only worth 3 points but ofc you take the opinion of the great american legend bobby fischer who said bishops is  worth 3.5 points and some chess engines say the same. but in human eyes bishop and knight is worth the same. Great video tho i love chess
There is a couple of mistakes, one is the King can capture the queen, if she stands right beside him, with no guard.
I really thought the chess vocabulary is going to be in this video
I wait rules Go game
3.5 for a bishop😂👌
You are wrong. Queen of white will stand on E1 means it will stand on black block and Queen of black will stand on F8 means it will stand on white block. Shame on you bright side shame on you!!
I learned how to play chess in the 2nd or 3rd grade
This is too much for mah brain. It's giving me a migraine.
wait wait wait... what did he just say? 4:10 he can attack any piece excpt for the other king and queen? so basically, if the enemy queen moves next to your king, not being covered, you still cant attack and take that piece?   also, 3:41 the queen is the "most important" piece? rly now? she is the strongest piece on the board,but not the most important...   and imo, why would anyone promote a pawn to anything besides a queen and a knight (if needed)? bishop and rook promotion makes mostly no sense if you can get a queen
*pulls chessboard out* im ready:)
chess is a racist game   kinda?
There is no queen but General and the corner pieces are elephants.
Well, it's a good Information, but you forgot something,   *it's a "Draw Tactic", it's happened when you and your enemy move 1 unit to other square, then turn it back again, and re-do it again in the same square for 2 times, then the match will be draw(if there's no moving time/timer for move,whatever is it calls).   *And you can't castling if your king is/was in check  *After 1 match you should change side (black to white/ white to black)  *Sometimes you don't need to checkmate your opponent to win, just wait for your enemy to surrender  Sorry for my bad English
Thx so much bright side ur the best
👏👏
One caution: chess is an addiction. I'm not joking. It has wasted 2 years of my life. And a lot of money as well. Ratings are drugs. Chess will waste your life. This is not a joke.

I think that they does'nt have enymore ideas
Mikhail Tal is still my favorite. I hope Magnus defends his title in November. I don't want an American to win. And tbh he is not even an American. America hasn't produced a good GM since Bobby Fischer
I am chess pro B) :D
Happy to see 14 million in ur channel
Well i thought the kings were placed on e1 and d8
French move must be done immidiately, so it can not be done unless the next move right?
Hi bright side. Lovr ur channel. u do videos on great stuff. However. I would really really really appreciate if u DO  NOT  SEND ME ANYTHING ON MEGHAN  MARKLE. SHE IS OF NO IMPORTANCE TO ME WHAT SO EVER. THANK U.
I am a professional player from Jamaica and I am willing to give proper introductory lessons for free online. Please let me know if you are interested.
Bright side there are a number of things wrong with this video.  You did not address capturing pieces adequately. The movement of the knight sideways was not explained clearly. You forgot to mention that the pawn can't move backwards. The queen is not the most important;  it's the most powerful. Lastly you didn't state that the pieces have to be set up a specific way. However overall it is good that you tried to inform the people of the game. I applaud your efforts.
Finally I know how to play chess !! 😭😭
i didn't know about the pawn special moves.
I love and can play chess from Nepal
Points matter? It’s going to end with a checkmate so I think it’s not important
Wait is chess a sport I have played like for 7 years but I thought it was just a game I know there’s clubs and championships but I  just watching this because I think I want to buy another deck with numbers
It should be A2 to H2.
4:36
Um.... I dont know if, any one else notice (because i play chess) but when he intorduced the pone, he said A-1 to H-1 instead of A-2 to H-2.
Thats my favorite game
So pawn promotion can give me two queens right :))
#love you bright side From #Nepal
Correction: Pawns go on A-2 to H-2 and A-7 to H-7. got used to saying 1 from the other pieces XD
To be good at chess, learn the openings and tactics. I recommend ChessWebsite.com search it up on YouTube. I hope you listen to me, I’m a grandmaster and I rarely lose. Not to show off.
Always helpful
I love chess .. chess..☺☺☺
Ny favorite sport yeyy
Where is the origin of this game?? I mean which country... you didn't mention
I'm a long time chess player. This isn't a bad guide.  The best way to learn chess, is it just play it.  :)
It's my favorite game!!  DIEHARD FAN💖
Who else went to download or play chess board after this😂😂
please make one about rubiks cube
Also, I'm pretty sure you can't castle if you move through check or end up in check.
Who still play this?
Knight is 3 and bishop is 3.5? But i like knights though D:
White goes first? Chess is racist.
The funny thing is that you could of ate the bichup with the pawn when you where teaching about the rook xd.
I'm in the chess team I'm the second best 😎.

0:17 Go players.
Pretty good crash course. Most people don’t play with points because it’s an entirely different game with it’s own strategy. In the right hands, the knight can be more powerful than the queen. Also, why didn’t you warn them about the 4-move checkmate and how to counter it?
They're we'll be so many corrections
Say check, excel in bug house. Take your time, except in blitz. Castle your king, and never move the F pawn early in the game. How to avoid an early loss
I came 2nd in Toronto's City Finals when I was in Grade 8
4:41, don't you mean the white pawns take the row of A2 to H2? Also, I thought it was 3 points for a bishop?

The first picture shown for checkmating was actually a stalemate.
Who wants to play with me a chess?
Chess is my favorite sport
What about Stalemate?
No the most important is King if don't have a King you can't play
Anyone else already knew how to play chess but just wanted to watch the video cause they had nothing better to do?
love the vid!!
This video is very useful for all chess player's
Is it just me or is Bright Side uploading way more videos than usual?
Played against a guy that always started with D2-D4 so I started with G1-F3. He was startled so much he lost the match right then. And maybe 30 moves later with plenty of pieces still on the board I warned him of his next move. He did not listen and he was Check and my next move was Check-Mate. I did offer a rematch but he declined.
What a confusing game
am l the only one scrolling comments section instead of watching the video
D
63rd view oh yeah
*Legends say that after* *watching this video you can* *even beat Magnus Carlsen*

I just love this game. It´s very exciting. But, one should be warned, when you lose playing this game, it´ll haunt you all through out your day thinking why you lose and planning how to get revenge 😁😁😁. It isn´t easy to recover at all. Yet, playing chess worth your time very well.
Well... I know all these things... But don't know any of the terms in the game,  types of attacks, defenses and so on. So I always get to a point where I don't seem to pick the right move. And get easily mated.
You should make more chess videos
Can you do a beginners guide to go ( wei qi )?
Tell some best openings also...pls bright side
Even though I play chess too much, I clicked on this to see how they worked on a video about chess, they got most of the part, but the Bishop is actually 3 points like the knight, but it depends on the position, so it is possible for a knight to be better than the bishop. Controlling the centre isn’t the most important, but you could say so if your a beginner. Once you get the hang of playing, you’ll understand that there are always exceptions to most rules in chess. Also, castling queenside with the b1/b8 square attacked ONLY, its fine to castle as long your not castling through check or into check, it is perfectly fine for your rook to move though, but not the king.
