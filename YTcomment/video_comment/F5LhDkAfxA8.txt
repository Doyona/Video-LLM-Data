Oh wow so much easier than Usain the pectin and the long process of canning.  Thank you so so much for the tutorial and video.
Superb recipe!
Omg I made this jam but I used 1kg strawberries 1 3/4 in white sugar an half a lemon I followed same instructions and totally amazing 😍😍😍🤤can u do a marmalade jam please 🙏
Thank you for the recipe🍓😊❤
Can u do a apricot jam and also a mixed berry jam please
Gree up with jams of what was in season, mom made em hot, poured in hot jars, poured wax on the top of them, lidded them, never put them in the fridge till opened !
Sugar can you use other organic sugar that are made from plants speva  for dietetics or want to stay away from  granulated sugar
I used coconut sugar and it came out amazing!! Who knew?😂
This recipe is a 10/10!! I would absolutely do this again. it was super easy and SO GOOD!!!! (It also made more than I thought it would, so that’s a plus!)
Could I use frozen berries?
I know you didn’t process this but can you? I won’t go through that much jam in 6 months lmao
I made this but half the batch one time and it came out too stiff any tips?
Just got to this recipe today and absolutely love how easy and simple it is  no fancy intimidating steps to follow. Made it and turned out great 👍. Thank you so much for sharing.
do i need to put water
❤
Honestly, chop the lemon into the bowl.  Finely chopped the lemon disappears, and is better that way.
Saw the jam tutorial today, got the strawberries & made it. Yummy! Thanks for a simple to follow recipe.
Is it possible to make sugar-free strawberry jam? What will the ingredients, other than strawberries, for making sugar-free jam?
Can u use honey instead of sugar
We strawberry picking with my girls over the weekend.  We are looking forward to make our first jam.
For how many days it stays edible in Fridge?
I m going to make this today. Thank you so much❤️
I am very impressed with this method. I noticed that you didn't dry the jars before putting the mixture in. Hope the jam will stay longer without going bad. Really appreciate your reply. I want to try your recipe, we have a bumper harvest of strawberries in Switzerland this summer.
This is the BEST recipe ever 🙏❤️❤️
This is the second time I have followed this recipe. The first small batch came out great and now I'm almost out of it. So I got more strawberries for another round. The last time I just used the cold plate method of checking, but this time I stuck my regular cooking thermometer in the mix when I figured it was ready, per your video, I put it in and it only got to 200. But as the mix was foam-less and bubbling like pudding...I was afraid to cook it anymore and burn the bottom. The plate test showed it was ready...so....hopefully it will thicken up just right when cooled. Thanks!
Great, i thought that you needed pectin to make it thicken.  No?
Does the longer boiling process take the place of pectin for thickening?
Why add lemon juice when your adding sugar??? Sugar makes all jams water bath safe??? We find when we eat the recipes with Lemon juice suck! Except canned apples soaked in lemon juice
Can I put this jam bottle in room. I mean without put in the refrigerator?
Best one I’ve seen thank you so much for sharing❤
I have 6 lb of prepared strawberries with the lemons, and sugar-. So one and a half lemons and I used seven cups of sugar because the strawberries aren't sweet at all, my neighbor gave them to me, fresh from her garden and she said they're not sweet and she said she uses them for smoothies and I love to make smoothies too but have no room in my freezer so I thought I'm going to use them for jam. And I love this jam recipe so I'm hoping I can use 6 lb and that it will turn out just this wonderful as the regular 2 lb that I did before!
This IS THE RECIPE I was looking for! Simple recipe, no additives whatsoever. I will make small batches for the family. Thanks for the recipe.
I learnt about a double,heavy bottom pan, huge difference
Thanks for teaching me how to make jam the right way!❤
Banana is a berry can thet work?
Have a question: should I put the hot jar with hot jam into the fridge or wait till cool down?
Did he say masterbate  !?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!??!?!?!?😮
Can this be made with agave??
very unhealthy with all your sugar !!
What can I use in place of lemon juice (that’s not pectin)? I have a family member allergic to citrus.
How to preserve it without refrigeration
Nice recipe 🎉🎉
I'm going to try this ❤
This was a very stressful process. I’ll never do it again lol
Recipe was great but next time I’ll cut my strawberries smaller or use an immersion blender. The strawberry pieces were too big for me
How long will jam stay till expire?
Wish I would have found this recipe before I made runny jam TWICE 😭😭😭
Has anyone ever used monk fruit?
WOW Thank You for sharing I Love love I'm going to try it
What a brilliant idea to use the Mellon baller to hulled the strawberries. Took no time at all. Thank you I will be cooking them in the morning GOD willing!
Made the jam! It was perfect. Tyyyy!
❤🎉😮😊
Can I use frozen strawberries for this?
That’s a lot of sugar isn’t it?
Can you use other sugars, like monk, Stevie, brown,coconut
something is not proportional with the sugar.. 1 cup equals to 200 grams of sugar. 400 grams on this amount of strawberries?? i think 240 grams is more then enough
This recipe was so tasty but mine got a weird texture when I put it in the fridge
2lbs stawberry, 1/2 lemon juice, 2c sugar,
Just found this and tried it out 🎉🎉 easy and turned out delicious !!!
Love this recipe, came across this vedio 5 years ago and only use this recipe since. Been coming back to it every strawberry season since! Sending lots of love
any substitute for sugar pls?
How long can it last in the refrigerator before it expires once the jar is opened?
Made this yesterday! It was the best thing I have ever made! Thank you for the recipe! ❤
I used frozen fruit thawed then did this worked well.
No sugar please
Is this a safe recipe to waterbath can?
i made this for my husband, he loved it
Made it, loved it
You, my guy, just got another sub. This was so informative and the instructions were very easy to write down.
Can I use lime juice instead if I m out of lemon?
Can this jam be frozen?
Thank you for sharing.....Is brown sugar ok to use?
Is it the same way Making a cherry jam?
I love this recipe so much and look forward to doing it again in the future... I wanted to know can you do the same with peaches. I have peaches from my peach tree and I was wondering if you have to use pectin, for peach jam
So you didn't skim the foam. I usually do, but I'll try your way.
Can one use a zero sugar substitute?
Love it❤
If you microwave the lemon for 20 seconds you get twice as much juice. Xx
Strawberries here are about $10 plus per pound. We don’t grow them. I splurged and bought 2 lbs and made the jam. It came out beautifully. From hereon I’m making my own jam. Much thanks for this recipe!
Hi, anyone have any Tips and ideas how I can adjust this if I want to add rhubarb?
Simply the bestest, simplest recipe  👌🏽 Thank you
Thank you. I made and it is perfect.
does anyone know if it's the same for other fruits like peachs, apples etc?
Thanks for sharing 🌻
I wish he was still making videos. I LOVE this channel and his tutorials are amazing!
I have been making this jam for years and last night it wouldn’t thicken and I thought maybe it it’ll thicken over night, does anyone think I can try and reboil tonight to try and thicken it again?
Recycled jam jars, (sterilised in microwave, lids boiled for 15 minutes, ) hot jam poured in hot jars , lids on tight asap, works like factory seals !!  My jam doesn’t spoil for years..    Great jam, thanks for sharing.  cheers
Did you filter the seeds or strawberry pieces or do you leave them in the jam?
Love it 🥰
Thank you, Sir! It’s a simple  details recipe.  Look forward for more your videos!!  God blesses.
Just watched the video, loved it.  I would like to can it can you please give me the instructions for it. Than you
this is soo easy to make and delish have made it multiple times and even added other berries all turned out amazing! thank you for the recipe🥰
I bet this would be delicious when making homemade pop tarts 🤤
Thank you for making a recipe for 2 ✌️
Not in international mesures 🙄
Set your pot in a slightly larger heavy skillet to prevent burning and even out the temp across the surface
Save the tops for a quick and yummy tea
I just made this recipe and it turned out insanely delicious 😋 i highly recommend it enjoy ❤
Made this recipe works amazing. Thanks for sharing ❤❤❤❤❤
I cried my ass out😢😢bimbo I was expecting a happy ending 😢
How do you deal with the seeds of any berry?
It's not the same for ALL berries. There are a few that contain very little pectin & will not thicken like a normal berry. Autumn berries for one!
OMG!!! This recipe is great. My first time! I'll never buy preserves again.😀
Organic strawberries healthy choice if possible… Cutting down sugar and subbing lime for lemon works for me.  Mixing in raspberries and blueberries interesting in any combination.  Very forgiving recipe.
Looks delicious
This is the same recipe I’ve been using for years and it always comes out amazing. I also use it with peaches, apricots, berries, and mangos. Yes, mangos. It is my new favorite. Don’t use the large green mangos. They are too stringy. Use Ataulfo mangos. They are the smaller yellow ones, sometimes called honey mangos.
Hints: use 1T of butter to reduce foam. First rinse your strawberries in vinegar water for 20 mins,to remove all the bad pesticides.
Thank you so much. This is so helpful.  Im a single person  so this works a lot better for me. Thank you
can a sugar substitute be used?
I miss the videos 😢.....
Delicious thankyou 😊❤️
The basic recipe is 1 of fruit to 1 of sugar.  Strawberrys have no pectin so add and apple.
Yiu dont needs this much water
Would I use the same amount of monk fruit to replace the sugar?  This looks delicious.
I love strawberry jam❤❤❤❤
Lemon Juice is the main ''sauce for pectin"' . you said ''no pectin"'
What happens if I don't use lemon?
Works wonders❤
Yummm
😎 Bro u Jammed 🇵🇰💯👌
I would use monk  sugar n less
Thanks. Looks easy and delish 😊
Oh my goodness talk about perfection! I have made grape jam from my grapevines. I have made peach jam. I have made grape blueberry, grape, blueberry& blackberry jam, but not strawberry yet and I have wanted to so much! I had gotten a beautiful container of strawberries and I knew we wouldn't be able to eat them fast enough so we ate a few and then I took a few out of the freezer that I had for smoothies and added them to make a full 2 lb container again, and I mixed it up with the sugar and I forgot the fresh lemon juice and I let it sit overnight in the refrigerator almost two nights. I ended up making it at midnight the next day so almost two nights in the fridge but then I added the half a lemon cooked it up and it looks absolutely perfect. One thing I wanted to add is I didn't have any foam. There was no foam while cooking mine, Maybe a tiny bit right at the beginning and then it went away... I'm going to try a little bit. I had a little bit extra, I put in a little glass container and it made three half pints perfectly filled... What a simple, lovely recipe. I was so glad to find this! I'm wondering if we did want to make more if it would be okay to double, triple or quadruple this recipe? Or would you have to add some pectin? I wonder,as this turns out so perfectly as is. I just wonder if you can make a bigger amount also? Yum yum!! Just tried it on toast. Absolute perfect consistency. I might have to have another piece, This is heavenly, So if you're reading this and you haven't tried it yet, try it now!
Perfect recipe! Have to adjust time for altitude. I live at 9400 feet and 30 mins is the perfect time.
Can you use frozen strawberries?
Can i use cane sugar instead of white?
Well at $6 per jar of Smuckers, I don't buy it anymore. I will try this! thank you.
More than perfect 🌹🌹🌹
Can you make this jam with a substitute sugar like stevia or less sugar?
Just made this! Can’t believe how easy-so excited!
This came out delicious thank you!
Thank you so much.. Its a winner ... I have made it a few times.
I love this recipe as a fresher in making strawberry jam,  I added a little of ginger paste,  it was good  .. people you'll love the favor of ginger too.  Nways  thanks for the receipe
Yum and those biscuits
Can we make without lemon?
Hey hey hey!!! I did it!! OMG!! I looked at serve other videos before getting here AND let me tell you!!! This is it!! Simple. Delicious! Follow exactly and do not jump ahead...respect the process and YOU WILL repeat the rewards! I accidently had to use a whole bag of strawberries right away and I needed strawberry jam and BOMB! Thanks again for an easy solution and recipe! BLessings!
Thank you for sharing it looks delicious 😋👍👍
Your strawberries are gorgeous! I live in Southern California and the fruit, especially strawberries aren't very good. Thank you for this recipe! Strawberry jam is my husbands, favorite and I'm tired of paying $7 for a jar of strawberry jam.
tastes great. a little bit too sweet but the texture is great. when i make it again i will use 20% less sugar
🌷☕️🧁🍓🍍
Great video man ❤
Oh wow! I  have to try it this week. Looks too yummy
Just made this jam for my dad because its his favorite kind an he loved it
This recipe turned out amazing!! But follow the recipe i did the mistake of adding more lemon juice thinking that there wasn't enough liquid but it still turned out really good!!
Just made this today. The whole time I was thinking I was gonna mess up. But nope. Very easy thanks to your video! THANK YOU!
ok. I want a more healthy jam. can I use anything else instead of white sugar like monk fruit? or different sugar? not white
You are blessed,i will keep watching your videos and trying every recipe.I am done with the chilli sauce and now lets try out some Strawberry Jam❤
It is the third time I'm making it
Amazing 👌
Sept 2023 I made this jam today and its delicious. Using the melon baller was a great hack!
If you wanted to process how long would you wb can it?
Could I use allouse
Turned out great, easy to follow my husband says Tom now on only homemade, oh boy what have I done?LOL
Can it be left at room temp? If so how long will it last
This jam is awesome on pancakes 🥞 with whip topping. 🍓 🥞
❤BEST RECIPE I HAVE FOUND, HE EXPLAINS EVERYTHING SO WELL.❤ THANK YOU THE KIDS LOVED IT FOR SURE. 🍓 🥪 🥞 🍓 🎂
🍓❤ 🍓Thanks so yummy 🍓 ❤🍓
Wow my daughters love jam on their toast. I have to try this thanks!
The best recipe ever I tried it several time and It’s highly recommended, Thanks you are the best Chef 🧑‍🍳
I love that I can make this and gift it to my family in these jars. 🙌 Thank you!
This is the best recipe i ever made! Thanks so much!
great information step by step is what we need.
what about the seeds?
Thank you! It turned out perfect! Did strawberry and blueberry today!👍😎🙏❤🙏
Great stuff. I got 3 half pints. Ty
I loved the idea of the recipe! For me , tho, it dident quite turn out right. This was my first time, so when i did it i added less suger, thinking a had added too much😂😂Oh how wrong i was. Once i thouht it was done, it was sooo thick , i could bearly put it on a spoon. i tried the plate trick, to no success. it hardened on the plate right away. Im going to try adding hot water. Any other suggestions? Tysm for a great vid Also, is anyone else searching through the comments to see if they did it right? 😊😊
Can I use honey instead of sugar?
Can I use brown sugar please?
Great work ❤
Can you use less sugar?
Brilliant unless it is authentic & genuine, BRAVO
This i think is d most great recipe for strawberry jam. Do you have a video for pineapple jam making as well?
I only use june bareing strawberrys because there more aromatic and sweeter and just a all around better berry for jam in my opinion.
Easier and less sugar. 2 ingredients, frozen strawberries and gelatin. Heat strawberries and mash them add gelatin ( I wing the amounts) let cool. Delish and no sugar. Can freeze in small batches if desired.
Just made this and was doubting myself the whole way through but I actually did it, thank you so much for this video, I used the jam as a present for my mom's birthday, I really hope she likes it
It turned out amazingly good thank you
You can use figs instead of strawberries exactly the same way!
Thank you! 😉 👍
Just seen this YouTube strawberry jam recipe. Amazing. Great recipe so simple and yes delicious!
Great information included throughout the video that many people may assume others would know. I learned a lot about the process and even about the temp of the glass jars. Thank you.
I swear I will never buy store bought jam again. 🙌🥳♥️🍓
Cool that looks yummy and easy to make I will make strawberry & blackberry.
Thanks for the information.
Tasty
it turned out perfect! thank you!
Just made this. Got three half pints of the most delicious jam I have ever made. Excellent!!
just made this and it tastes great, however the consistency is a little chewier and thicker than i wanted. if anyone whos made this has any suggestions i would love some on how to either remedy it or improve for the next time!
If there is lemon juice flavor more prominent in the jam after cooking it, what can be done? Please suggest.
Can you double the recipe to make more?
How long is it good for?
Does anyone know if you can use frozen (once thawed) Strawberries for this recipe?
Can't eat it all? Freeze a couple  jars.
Sounds wonderful!
🥰I love watching your video.   Can I replace strawberries with our llocal fruits, Aratiles? (Philippines)
Thank you so very much ❤️😊
This brings back good memories. My mom gave me a book on making jam when I was three years old. I loved that book so much! ❤ Thank you!!!
Thank you. How successful is this method with other fruit?
It’s a good instruction. But you should be aware a good jam recipe NEVER measures sugar amount you need to use in cups, which is called volume measurement and it’s extremely inaccurate for things like jam, bread, cured meat and especially something you need to preserve. Even if you don’t process the jars to last a year, you should always at least use weight, which is % of the fruit weight. And use metrics. It’s only in the U.S. non-metric measurement is used. I mean isn’t this a global platform? A cup in the U.S. is drastically different from a cup in elsewhere too. In where I live a cup is 200 ml. And volume measurement is not the standard of jam making as it’s inaccurate. A good recipe for jam making tells you to use % weight to the fruit weight and not in volume. So for 1kg of fruit(s), you need to use 50% weight sugar (500g) or 45% sugar (450g), and so forth depending on how sweet you want and the type of fruit you use. I think it’s a good instruction for plate testing jam (there are other easier ways to test a jam like frozen spoon method though). But measuring sugar in cups for making jam is not a great way to measure sugar amount. Also, lemon juice is normally added for flavor and to brighten up the jam and added towards the end of cooking. The fresh lemon juice you squeeze has essential oil, which is lemony flavor. If you add it at the beginning everything evaporates and fresh lemon flavor dies and essential oil of lemon evaporates too. Try adding lemon juice towards the end of cooking and cook only tiny bit more.
Hii.ask lang po aside po sa jar san pa po kaya pedeng ilagag ung jam?
Can you freeze this?
I love this recipe. I come back to it every strawberry season! ❤
How long can this stay in the refrigerator for?
What if I blend strawberry and sugar together before putting it into heat?
Why not use a mixer grinder to paste everything, then start with adding sugar step
I found this recipe some days ago, and I made the jam today. IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Easy to prepare, a few ingredients and doesn't take long. I used only 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 and it was perfect for me and my kids!  Thank you so much for sharing!!!
A cup of sugar.   2lbs fresh strawberries.     Please stick to lbs or cups. not both.   whats a frigging cup.  Ah a cup for the world cup football final.  Is that too small?
This is best jam recipe for a beginner my jam turned out 10/10 Thank you for the video ❤
Make more Fruits  jam
Better than buying Suger is a gift too Enjoy 🌹
Beautiful beautiful Beautiful journey gifts shine bright 🌞
Homemade Thanks 👍😊
I have tried this today and it is AMAZİNG! Thanks a lot for the recipe.
Thanks for not making it complicated
I got perfect tasting jam following his instructions except thermometer did not help. I boiled it and stirred it until it had thick consistency and dark color around thirty minutes. I put only 1 and 1/4 cups of sugar. 2 cups of sugar is way too much and not necessary.
Nice
Just made this, already had a sample. SO GOOD! thank you!
What about using grapes for grape jam
IF YOUR JAM GETS TOO THICK!!! Add boiling water to it and put it back on the burner and keep stirring until its become one with the water you added and you start seeing a few bubbles on top!!! This happened to me and I couldn't find a comment to solve this issue but I figured it out so you don't have to!
We have tons of wild raspberries in the summer in my area -- I'll make this and Individually Quick Freeze (IQF) the rest. The flavour is so rich and sweet. We have blackberries too, I could make a combo jam. Looks perfect!
I just tried this and it’s really really good 😋
Thank you for the recipe
So idk what I did but mine turned out suuuuuper thick and not playable at all.. I think I cooked it too long, can anybody help??
How long should it be on the fire for?
Great job on the jam, now can I use my frozen Strawberries with same recipe?
How long can i store this in the fridge?
My favorite recipe. So easy and so good.
Oh my this is the perfect recipe, many thank yous ❤❤😊
Can we put wapping cream or milk when we cook this jam?
Can one use a substitute for sugar like Stevia?
Will this work with other types of berries?
Looks delicious...  Thank you ..
I tried this recipe and It turned out very well. Delicious and much better than store bought ones.  Just one query , can we make strawberry jam avoiding refined sugar ? Any other alternative?
IF YOU PUT A LITTLE BYTTER IN IT IT WONT FOAM AS MUCH  THREE YEARS LATER IM GOING TO TRY AND MAKE THIS GREAT JOB HAPPY NEW YEARIN THE YEAR 2023,
how long he can stay inside?
Fake news
🙏👍
my one is really ugly and also it doesnt buble, i put it onmedium-high heat but it wont, i need help
Hi I just made this it’s delicious. I only had a pound. I can eat just by the spoon. Thank you
I tried this recipe... It didn't work for me, once I put it in the fridge afterwards it became rock hard.
How to make this jam smooth? I don't really like chunks in my jam
Fantastic recipe. I made a small batch and it’s soo good. I also really love that it’s all natural
I just finished making this for the very first time and wow!!!! It’s delicious! Thank you so much for this simple quick but very detailed explanation.
I don’t know what I did wrong everything look the same in the video even when I put it in the jar and then put it in the refrigerator and when I took it out and took off the lid it was like a sandy slush I don’t understand what I did wrong can anybody tell me?
do i have to wait for the temperature to cool down before covering the lid? and put in the ref
Hello from Indonesia.. Can we make youghurt strawberry by mix it to the youghurt ..?  Thank you for this amazing recipe.

Perfect strawberries jam. Yummy 😋 👍👍👍👍
made this today worked perfectly. I might try it with less sugar as it is sweet.
I can still can and process to put in the pantry correct? Instead of storing in the fridge?
Thanks!
Thank you so very much and also thank you for carefully explaining things that may arise during the cooking process again thank you so very much and God bless you.!!!
Straight and to the point thank you 😊 Beautiful Strawberry 🍓 Jam ❤️
Excellent easy recipe made strawberry jam. Delicious
My daughter and I just made some strawberry and raspberry jam but it didn't set. Would it be okay to redo it and add more pectin to it?
YOO THAT WAS A LOT OF SUGAR LMAO I DONT WANT DIABETES
I just made this jam using about 5 cups of strawberries, 2 cups sugar and 1 tbsp of bottle lemon juice.  I followed this video from beginning to end and the jam turned out great!  Super easy video to follow.  I got 1 bottle cause I used a bigger jar than the video.  5 star recipe!!!
Thank you great video
definitely  a win recipe
How do you store this?? I followed every step and put it in the fridge.. When i took it out the next day to use on some fresh baked bread it was ROCK SOLID.. Is it supposed to be pantry stored??
wtf is LBs just use kg it makes so much more sense smh. ya'll americans try way too hard to be different from your parents smh ew
Fabulous!!!  Turned out perfectly as you show.  I got 1 and one half pints.  My garden has a small patch, so when I have enough, stored in the freezer, I make it up!!  I liked hearing, "like candy making".  That reminded me to boil and boil!  I 'm anxious to see what else you got!!  And thanks, beautiful color, perfectly jell, delicious!!
Thanks for this!!!
Made really good quality jam with the recipe :)
I love how easy this is to make!  Just preparing my second batch!  Thanks so much!
Thank you so much for posting this
Best recipe ever 😋
will make this for sure, to go with my home made yogurt! Thank you for sharing.
Wish it could be a printable recipe!
Thanks for the great video! But I'm English, so it's a scone, not a buttermilk biscuit!
Did this with pineapple and omg 😍😋😋😋😋😋
Amazing 👏🏽
Can someone help me? I’m new at canning. I don’t want to use pectin (not sure that matters or not, but how can I make this so that it can stay in a cabinet (not the refrigerator) for more than 6 months?
This was amazing!! It turned out 100% PERFECT AND DELICIOUS THANK YOU 🌹🥰
Wow. I never knew that this is how jam is made!! Wow. I am so intrigued and shocked!! I feel so empowered through this recipe!! I can’t wait to try it in the future!!🙏❤️
How long will this jam keep? Can I store it in my pantry if I make extra?
This is the perfect recipe for strawberry jam. I use this recipe every year to make jam during summer.
Can I use frozen strawberries?
😋😋😋
Just made my jam and I'm wondering why I ever used store-bought jam!
Thank you. This looks super easy and delicious.
I trick I use to seal the jam is put the water filled jars in the microwave for 3 minutes to boil the water. then put you lids in water you heated. put in the jam hot just after the boiling and tighten then completely then loosen half turn you want just enough for air to escape. then have a bath towel folded into for layers think and place the hot jam jar upside down. The heat reflected form the towels insolation will seal the jars in under 5 min. if the seal did not set eat it first or put the jam jar (no lid) in the microwave for 2 minutes put back on the ring and flip it again using a new lid.
I just made this tonight.  It turned out amazing! ❤
Thank you for sharing! Made this yesterday and it turned out great! I did cut down on the sugar by 1/2 cup. Your recipes are always great!🧡
I really want to do this but how do you weigh strawberries😅
Can you use sweetner ? Will it have the same effect?
We are growing strawberries 🍓 too
Thank you so much. Every thing you said I did and the jam came out perfectly delicious!
you go from 2lb of strawberries to 2 cups of sugar so for us UK peeps what is 2 cups equivalent to pounds?
Followed this recipe it came out perfect.
I watch a different kind of a strawberry Jam recipe , but is east n looks good
So if you process this jam, it can be stored on the shelf?
hi, is it possible to substitute sugar with stevia or another sweetener? if so is the ratio for one cup the same ? thanks looks delicious
Just made a double batch of this and it was amazing!! Perfect consistency and flavor!
Would the process be different for peaches?
I tried it and I’m now never buying store bought strawberry Jam as I loved this home made Jam   Today I’m trying making it with Splenda , sugar free Jam, hope will get same results
Does it work without lemon?
Thank you for this wonderful recipe.
hi, i made this but cut everything in 1/2, i didnt have a mason jar so i used a tupperware container, just wondering because i didn't do a 'hot water bath' how long it will last in the fridge?
very easy recipe, thanks
I have a question, I made jam the first time it turned out perfect and the second time it turned out runny I don’t know what I did wrong any ideas?
I'm so impressed I wanted to use up a handful of berries that were getting looked over.... This works soooooo gooooooood
Made it, just like you said. Right down the 3 jars  ♡ thank you!
your voice sounds jamm!
❤️
Everyone needs salvation here are the words of salvation please forgive me jesus im a sinner come into my heart and save me from my sin I no that you are the savior and I no that you died for me on calvary and I no that God raise you from the dead and you are alive and I thankyou for your salvation in Jesus holy name amen and its important to always ask for forgiveness everynite
Don't panic don't pant captain Mannering , I haven't gone mad that's for Dad's army fans, anyway here we are  2 hours later with an update on my first attempt at making strawberry jam, ok where did I go wrong , did all the prep and about 20 minutes of stirring nothing was happening so I turned the heat on lol no sorry that's my sense of humour, no after 20 minutes on high heat and stirring I got a foam and it was looking like a strawberry milk shake so I am thinking half  way there lets keep stirring and reduce this down ,half hour later still the same so I added another cup of sugar bearing in mind my wife said don't add to much sugar, anyway still no different still foaming so I took off the heat ,i had already turned the heat down then back up again and I was getting nowhere ,anyway I took off the heat let the foam go away and I cheated at this point I added some cornflour to thicken, added to to the heat again for the cornflour to work it's magic and I got something looking like strawberry jam ,the colour looked more like tomato chutney but its  jam , I only live a few minutes walk from the hospital so I'm ok if the wife try to kill me for the extra sugar or if I get food poisoning 🤣, but where did I go wrong why did my jam need the cornflour why did it not thicken?
I got todays crop and was 2 Kgs bang on half way through doing this and looking good thank you for taking the time to share this I always thought making jam was so hard but you made it easy, good job I doubled checked cos 2kgs is in fact just over 4 LBS so I doubled up the sugar fingers crossed I will update after done
Awesome recipe…try it, you’ll love it!!!
Thank you 10/10
I will try this reciepe
Superb video interesting lovely colour jam my job for the weekend is making some strawberry jam
One of the best jams I ever tasted!  Turned out berry well!
Once jarred do you allow it to cool before putting it into the refrigerator or do you put the jars directly into refrigerator after?
Could you use frozen berry's
How long does it last?
Yum!!!!
What does 1 cup mean?
Made this, works a treat.
this actually works.  I never got near sticking to the bottom...."game's over" was enough of a warning for me.  2 lbs made a perfectly sweet/tart perfectly coagulated jam.  So Thank You! Mr. Crackerjack!
Thank you so much,this has created so many good memory’s and I’m only a tween
Can I just wait for it to cool before transferring it to jars?
The texture and flavor came out exactly like the type of strawberry jars you would purchase at the store!  Thanks for this video. Will definitely be making more homemade jam following this tutorial :)
AWESOME. Pectin here is packaged expensively, and i bought unflavored Gelatin, but will try this first.
The ratio is 1 cup sugar to 1lb strawberries?
As soon as i put them to jars can i store them in the fridge??or do i keep them out to come to a room temp and then refrigerate??
Have made this 3 times and it's been awesome. One batch got overcooked due to my inexperience, but the other two turned out great.
I loved the recipe when I made it last summer and this time the thing I love most is when he says jayum
you were suppose to add a pat of butter to your biscuit first !
Apparently I'm the only one here who didn't have a great experience. The taste is fine but my first attempt resulted in a jam that's really gummy and a challenge to spread. Did I overcook it? Any advice?
Thank You ....Just the ticket , is: "PERFECT!!!"
do you have to let it come to room temperature before sealing the lid?
This man is a genius!! Aye, they call me salty green eyed across the 7 seas now....
Thank you, SO MUCH! During the freezer test, I tasted and dang-near LOST MY MIND! Didn't know it was so simple.
Opps, woke up next day to a solid block of strawberry candy in a jar, hard as a rock, I think it was because I replaced sugar with Stevia, I did everything else just as instructed including babysitting it for 35 minutes, although I used only 1/2 the ingredients as a test run for the Stevia.
I just try it out and it came out amazing jam, Thank
Juicyyyyyy
Simple easy and worked out great thank you
My wife and I are just getting into canning different things. Loved your video on the strawberry preserves. Do you have a video for raspberry preserves as well? Thanks
Looks yummy!!!
So very delicious 😋
Can you use coconut sugar or monk fruit sweetener instead?
Thank u  I will try this
How much strawberries did you use?
I just made some myself it tast soo good 😋
Very nice
Would a lime instead of a lemon work?
How long can the jam keep , a month ?
Is lemon juice optional?
Can I add brown sugar instead white sugar?
The first time I made this was so good ,but the next time turned out too sweet😫
I am not eating/cooking with sugar. Can Erythritol or Allulose be used instead of the sugar or will that just not work? Love the idea of being able to do small batches and not having to have a ton of special equipment. Thanks for the video.
10/10
Is it possible to use a sugar substitute like Monk fruit or something like that? Thank you
I made your jam this morning…it works….
I just made this An I’m never buying jam ever again !! Tysm
Can’t wait to try this for breakfast with biscuits for the kids.  Thanks Can you use frozen berries?
Do you put the lids on when it's hot, as soon as you put in the jars?
“It’s a nice easy process, no big deal”  “If you forget to stir you will die”
Do i need to cool it down before i store it to refrigerator?
This looks so good I wonder how it would turn out with mangoes? Gotta try with mangoes
what jars are those?
Great video! We just picked fresh berries and can't wait to try this!
How much quantity does it make?
I tried it and somehow messed it up. I followed the directions to a T and even lowered the heat a bit to make sure it wouldn’t burn since my oven seems to over heat and it was all going well till I had a thick dark brown chunky mess 😕 nothing was burnt to the bottom so I was confused how it happened. The strawberry’s didn’t break down. So sad 😭
Why isn’t my jam thickening?
Does anyone know how long to process this is we were to process them?
Amazing recipe, even for the novice jam maker!! Its delicious. I'm amazed to finally taste a jam that actually tastes like strawberries 😋😋😋😋
Can you can the jam that way I don't have to refrigerate
This a great recipe.  I made it a couple times.  Simple and delicious!! Thank you for sharing 🤗🤗
Fantastic recipe! I prepared exactly as per your instructions (just swapped half white sugar for brown sugar) and results were amazing!
😋😋😋
Wow! This Strawberry Jam looks delicious, tasty and yummy. Nicely prepared. Superb presentation.
This is an amazing recipe! Thank you so much!
How long will it last in the frig once the jar is opened?
The only jam I make hands down!
that was so amazing thank you  i made it today and it taste so good!!!
Following this recipe tonight with some fresh pine berries, I’ll let you know how it turns out!
I made strawberry jam but why is the color not bright red?? Mine is pale pink although we start the same
I made 2 batches in small sizes , kinda just eyeballed the sugar and it turned out wonderful. I’m making these cute pastries for my friends and I wanted to make jam as well for Valentine’s Day.  And I’m so happy how it all came out so easy truly recommend it :)
I already have the idea of how to prepare Jam , but i wanted to double check, I watched your video it's the same simplicity of how to do it perfectly as it was in my head , but still WORTH watching it , amazingly looking delicious. Now it's my turn. wish me luck.
Is it to close the lit while the jam is still hot?
I love the way how he made it look delicious
Heya , great video but what do you mean not processed ? Because it’s unprocessed it needs to stay in the fridge ?
Very Fantastic! Thank you for this homemade jam. No need to buy to the market
Does this need to be sealed right away ? And I am guessing wait for it cool down completely before putting it in the refrigerator. Also can it be stored in any glass container with lid ?
My boy love strawberry jam so much so I decided to try this recipe. It work well except I boil it too long, I think it is over 35 min an d it turned to a real strawberry candy 😅  Can someone share what is the exact time need to boil please , will like to try for another batch. Thank you

Great video. Thanks for the info!!! How would you preserve it?
Are you canadian
لااستطيع اعطيك لايك انها حقا رائعه لكن المعذره
awesome, I tried it with rice vinegar instead of lemon juice and it turned out well.
can I add a little bit of water if I like the cinsistency to be lil less thick?
That’s some good jam :-)
NO jams require candy thermometers and many do not require TONS AND TONS of strawberries. Just thought you should know.
I love it
Can I use frozen strawberries?
Add a tablespoon of unsalted butter to keep the jam from foaming...  also, all you need is a deep pot to process your jars.  Put a wash cloth or a silicone pad of some kind at the bottom of your pot,  cover the jars with at least 1 inch of water. once the pot comes to a boil, let it boil for 10-15 minutes,  shut off the heat, get the jars out with jar tongs, let it sit on the counter for 12 hours for them to cool down and for the lids to completely seal (it makes that beautiful POP sound!) And then your jars will be shelf stable.  You're welcome!
Sweet love it going to use honey 🍯 or syrup I don’t eat sugar god bless
Strawberry jam is good
Can I use frozen berries?
Can I use concentrated lemon juice instead of fresh lemon? Thanks!
Does this work for an apricot jam? Or a peach jam ?
I love this recipe easy strawberry jam
I make also pear jam...
He said this makes a jam that will last 6 mos. in the fridge without having to hot-water process the jars and that it works for berries. Does anyone know if it will work for a 1:1 ratio of strawberries and rhubarb? I’m confident the recipe will work but does adding rhubarb affect the time it will keep in the fridge?
Thanks a ton for the recipe...
Came back to say thank you so very much for the recipe. My strawberry jam came out nice n tasty. The good part is really simple, healthy n taste good. Have a great day. Thx u for the recipe 💕
I am doing it now. Almost through. Ten more minutes if boiling and I'm done. It is really turning into a jammy jam:)
could you use xylitol instead of sugar?
Oh for God sake America....its not the 1800's anymore, start using metric like 99.7% of the planet. You have no idea how backward you sound using imperial measurements
Hi, I know this video is very old but I just wanna ask, can I use non stick pan or a hot pot?
I made it following the recipe and it turns out perfect...Thank you so much for sharing...Not buying any more jam at the store...
I’m in love
I tried using 2 pounds of Strawberry and only 1 Cup of sugar, and it didn't thicken correctly, so definitely follow his recipe correctly, it will turn out much better!
I love your strawberry jam recipe. I already made it over and over again and it’s perfect and made more natural Thanks a lot!
How long does this last?
I haven seen you post in a long time
Pasti endulita banget👍👍👍👍
I just love this guy . He makes it so easy and it’s so simple . I will be following him
I did with frozen strawberries and every step of the way i tought it would not work but in the end it did and it turned out great, thank you.
Nice.Maybe crushing the strawberries will shorten the cooking time.Also a little butter will help with the foaming.Thanks i must try this👍.
10-10 I loved  it thank you !
How long can you keep it?
I attempted to make this jam today. Not sure what I did wrong. I did use a stevia/sugar blend sweetener instead of all sugar. But my jam is still too runny. Should I have cooked it longer maybe? Anyone have any ideas why it hasn’t set good!?!
Me as a Rue Ryuzaki cosplayer watching this: ... I can store this in the victims fridge-
Can I use less sugar ? Diabetic family members
OMG I JUST TRIED IT AND IT WAS SOO DELICIOUS. Was worried first n tried to make a small batch w/ 500grams instead, substitute lemon with lime since i didn't have any, and only have hotplate to cook it. It took wayyy longer with 600watt hotplate but it turned out to be so beautiful and tasty!!! Got only 1 200ml jar. I tried to make Strawberry milk with the jam and it was phenomenal!! NO MORE STORE BOUGHT JAM. THANK YOU STRAWBERRY JAM ANGEL!
Can I use mango instead?
Ah…… missed that 6 months in fridge comment, trying it today with wild blackberries……
I made this recipe today came out fantastic,thanks
Approximately how long will this recipe last in the fridge?
I only buy a jar of NGMO/all natural jelly when I'm hankering for a PBJ sandwich ... I will only make jam when I receive fresh fruit and this is a quick and tasty way to make it! Thank you for sharing!!! 👍
This is so perfect, thank you!! ❤️🌈
Great instruction and I even made great Strawberry and Raspberry jam, Thank you
Why did you avoid pectin?
Can I substitute with stevia? Trying to cut sugar!🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
This is my jam
Turned out perfect 👍. Its so simple and well explained, you can’t go wrong with it.
How long will this last if i store it ??
Can i use this for Apricot just to store in fridge for 6 months???😊
Please someone tell me what BTS stands for.
I love you Crouton
This was an awesome guide, thank you.  Surprised my dad with some homemade jam and biscuits thanks to you and he loved it haha. Cheers!
This strawberry jam recipe is the best
Of course, by the end you have no more strawberries left because they have melted, my wife like the jam without the strawberries, I like only the strawberries, I made a much large batch and use a bunch of strawberries that I crushed to produce the pectin, I boil them in advance to achieve what you did, then I add the nice strawberries, they would cook in a couple of minutes and stay intact, once they reach 105 Celsius, they are ready, I jar my strawberries, then I jar my wife's strawberryless jam.
Beautiful jam ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
👏 only regret it’s not keto🥺
Dose this work with limes
I made a strawberry drizzle using this method, it works very well
Cool video
Can I use frozen strawberries? If I can which ingredients I need to add or reduce?
one questions. How long does it take to clean?
this isnt animal collective
love this method....
my future mother in law brought us a bunch of strawberry jam and i ate it all. so i bought some more from the store and i HATED it. the difference between homemade and store bought is insane!! homemade is so much better and store bought is actually disgusting
Thank you, so much for shearing this recipe , it's always been a wish for me to make my own homemade jam but always thought it would be too difficult ! but this recipe is perfect it's my fourth time visiting , and it's become my go too video for homemade jam the results are delicious 😋 TU !
Perfect! Instructions easy to follow and, make sure you baby your food
OK to use brown sugar instead of white?
Looks delicious.I’m going to try using 1 cup of Truvia and 1 cup of sugar, less sugar.
I've never made jam or preserves in my life, but I made this today! Top 2 things that shocked me about this:  1. I was able to stand in the same place for ~40 mins constantly stirring, and  2. I ended up with perfect jam!  Had a teeny bit extra that didn't fit in my pint jar, and my mom used it as syrup for ice cream. I'm not even a huge strawberry jam fan (I prefer raspberry), but this is delicious. And simple! What more could you want?
yummyyyy from relaxing slime
Finally brought strawberries to make this but FORGOT TO BUY THAT KIND OF SUGAR😭 im just gonna make it with normal sugar
I first made it and then found the recipe.  I did it all wrong. Great explanation.
I just love making my homemade strawberry jam don't buy that stuff at the store anymore homemade jam is delicious
Made it and it was soo delicious. Thank you!
Does brown sugar work as a substitute for sugar?
I guess this would be tremendous if you wanted something short term...6 months in fridge. Small batch. I was hoping for something long term. Thanks for good info though. I'd probably make it and fill a bunch of doughnuts with it. Jesus bless.
Is it okay to use less sugar? (Am watching my sugar intake)
Thats like....Diabetes concentrated
Dang! Only have 1 pound! Half the recipe?
Thanks!!
,😔😔
It doesn't work without pectin
I managed to do it too. Love it n Thks for the tips❤️
Very good recipe. Thanks.
I just made mine today following your instructions.. it turned out great no more buying jam
If you’re making jam to sell, does it need a ingredient to keep it from going bad? 🤔
HELP! Can I use a sugar substitute to make this no sugar added?
how long will this last
Does anyone know what temperature this should reduce at? I have a candy thermometer and I am new to this cooking with sugar thing. I don't want to ruin it. Thanks all!
Just made this tonight and turned out fantastic. Thanks so much
Can I still water bath it to preserve my ham on self? Would I still put pectin in the jam or I wouldn’t need to ?
Wow your jam looks so delicious.. I love yr jar and where can I get this jar??
This was easy instructions to follow along. Thank you
Any time i ever get dry mouth again i will watch this video to make my mouth water 🤣 looks so perfect
I bought some sure jell because I was going to try my hand at making homemade jam. I stumbled on to this recipe and it has changed my life! It turned out perfect! I even used the same technique to make blueberry jam and it worked just as well. Going to try peach next. I looked at your channel and see where your last video was a year ago. I hope that you are doing well and wanted you to know that you are a huge help and inspiration. Thank you for all of your amazing videos.
What’s the reason for heating up the jars ?
Seen a film where a guy was obseesed with strawberry jam & fish paste Omfg 🍓🐠🤢🤮
How many days before its spoil?
is it optional to put in the lemons? I just ran out.
Thank you so much for sharing this  recipe. It's so easy like a beginner for me to do. It's really good I will be making it over and over and over again and sharing it with my friends. I love your recipes. I'll  be trying more of your recipes.
So couldn’t you use your fingers to remove the top ?
And so you chopped ningnings strawberries and boiled sugas sugar to make jimins jam?
I'm home alone so I'm gonna try this Nevermind I can't lol
How about peach, pear, apples etc? Lemon and sugar with any fruit to be jamed?
It’s really that easy…
This recipe is great it worked so well it tasted fruity and I dare to say better than store bought jam ( I don't know why ppl find more complicated way to do things
I tried this recipe and it turned out really good. Will surely make this jam again. Thanks for sharing! 👊🏼
Thank you your jam looks awesome I have been looking for a recipe and here you are the answer to my request 👍🏻🙏🏼
Would it effect the jam 🤔  if I use  vitamex
I just made this recipe and it turned out delicious 😋
My kids and I made this today...It was Awesome. Thank you.
Great one
I just only finished making this jam. In a hurry because I want it for my Swiss roll. 🤣  Thank you for a lovely recipe.
Whats is the purpose of the lemon? Can i do it with out the lemon juice? Thanks!
Thanks for sharing this simple video, I have strawberries in the garden and I will make this,
Thanks for this recipe I tried your recipe absolutely delicious I added raspberries to mine however 2 of my jars cracked though after pouring boiling hot water into them to sterilise 😫
I will make it  looks so simple, easy  to make
Oh my goodness!!! I made this and it's absolutely delicious. So easy and so fresh! I wish I thought to learn how to make this sooner.
I love that this is a small batch.  Some of us don’t have acres of farmland where we grow bushels of produce.  I know we can buy it in the store , but I much prefer fresh.    Also, the consistency of this jam is absolutely perfect.  So many of the other videos I have watched, their end product is way too soupy for me.    Thank you for putting this together.  I can’t wait to try it!
Is it really 2 cups of sugar ?  Why did he put 5 cups into his mixture. ?? ...  The  jug said 5 cups marked on the side of it.
pefect instructions to follow and jam was amazig
Can I store this in a small tupperware? I don't have glass jars at home.
hello can i use this video for our facebook post?
I tried with strawberry, blackberries and blue berries and I loved it
No one has a fucking weigh scale
Super ❤️
Do i need to cool down the jam before the lid?
Today is gonna strawberry jammie day
question, for each lb of strawberries it requires 1 cup of sugar? cup of sugar mean how many grams?
im sorry on behalf of my fandom DKKSNDJIIJGRGINRG 😂
Ok, I've made the kind with pectin, the no bake kind, and this one is the best! Even at high altitude, it went exactly as you said. I love the voice over style of the video, and the easy pace. Thank you, 5 stars!🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
I already added a little more sugar as suggested
It’s been over 20 mins and mine isn’t the same color…. Not even thick
This looks better (thicker) than the other 2 recipes I tried that did use pectin! I'm trying this with my next batch of strawberries. Thanks!
Just made this today and it turned out REALLY well. Last summer when I made jam, my mom and I used liquid pectin and never boiled anything and never added lemon juice so this is pretty much a whole new recipe. If I were to make jam again, I would do it using this recipe. Boiling and stirring for ~40 mins was a lot of work, but it's very worth it when you finally get to use it on toast or when you give a jar to a loved one. I am not an experienced cook. I only know a few recipes. If you're like me and nervous about trying, just go for it. Make sure to keep your distance from the pan because the mixture is VERY hot. Remember that you don't want it to stick on the bottom and you can tell that it's nearing the end when the foam gets to be a dark pink and finally it just stirs into the thickened mixture. Definitely use the frozen plate technique - this gave me sure confidence that the jam was done. Great little recipe :)
I never got the foam, even after stirring for 40 mins.. is it not a jam then? It became thick like a spread and tastes good but wondering what I did wrong. I had used 2 pounds of fresh strawberries and 1.5 cups of white sugar with lemon juice.
So it's pretty much a cup of sugar per pound of fruit?
Don’t use a large pot it sticks on the bottom and burns
Can you use Splenda ?
Nice, fast  and simple- well done!
Dear Crackerjack, How would it turn out if i froze my berries for a few months then made the jam?
My foam won’t go away
My foam won’t go away
armies stfu can we enjoy the jam pls
This is so good to try at home. Made it and everyone loves the jam. Wish I had seen this earlier. This needs 10/10 score....
Is it ok without the lemon i already used them✨✨
I’m making this now!
can frozen berries be used? (once thawed)
I just made this recipe, and it really taste amazing!!!! This is what I am looking for a Strawberry jam! the taste, the texture, I so love it!! thanks for sharing!!!!!! highly recommended!
Someone likes washing dishes  and wasting power  just do it in the pan with pectin  5 mins.
I picked Fresh strawberries today and make. Strawberry jam using this recipe. I stirred for about 40 minutes faithfully and IT TURNED OUT GREAT!!!!!
This was amazing I made this great video ! Thank you
I ate all my fresh berries 😅 can i use store bought
You put the crumbs in the jar man but great vid
How much calories does it have or think it has
good one
I find it strange that he 'goes ahead' a lot, and calls it 'Strawberry JEM' !
Who the fuck is Jimin seriously?🙄
I don't understand any if these crazy measurements, switch to metric it's easier... quart, pound, geez I've got to use a universal translator for all of it mate. Still looks good though.
Is this applicable to other fruits or just berries? Thank you.
Why does lemon juice need using ?
I love this recipe, I use it every time I make strawberry jam. Thank you.
I just followed your video step by step and it came out amazing!!  Thank you!!
Can I use frozen strawberries?
Thank you for this haha
Hi how do I refrigerate this jam ?
Did you now 🍓 strawberry’s are not berries
How long can you store it in the refrigerator?
Had to stop as soon as I saw all that sugar...uggg...
Wow yummy
Add 1T butter, wont boil up so bad.🤗
Great recipe! I made this today and it turned out so good! I've also tried cooking it for less time to get a strawberry sauce to put on cheesecake and ice cream.
YUMMY 😋🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓JAM BEAUTIFUL ✨ THANKS YOU GOODNESS 🌟❤️🖤💚🤎 FAMILY DAPHNE COTTON ALWAYS 💜 AWESOME,
I made a double batch of this and it was deeeeelicious! Plenty of jam for the next few months for my family of 4 (almost 5) ❤️🍓
Tried this super simple recipe and it turned out to be great.  100% recommended.
What is 2 cup in gram?
Does the jam need to cool in the jar before you transfer to the refrigerator?
I have spent an hour looking for this video!!! Misplaced my recipe I wrote down a while back. My family ONLY WANTS this one!!! It is sooooo goooood!!! And so easy. Doubled the recipe and after cooling down, jars go into the freezer! Easy easy easy! THIS IS THE BEST, I swear!
Amazing !!  I highly suggest this recipe . Result was superb
Thank you! I do NOT eat gelatin. Blessings.
I made it a couple of weeks ago after watching this vid. Turned out awsome, trying raspberrys today... took forever to cut them in half so i just dumped then in the bowl and mashed them a little.... 1 hour waiting time now
Just made this and it is my very first homemade Jam and it is DELICIOUS!!! AN ABSOLUTE KEEPER FOR ALWAYS!
That's amazing. So simple and good
I'm going to watch the video of making strawberry jam and copy it. Thank you for the great video. Thank you for the video. I am making flower tea, dessert, and Korean cuisine in Korea. Nice to meet you.
i bet it works with a lot less sugar
Can I make this with cranberry?
Can I use less sugar but same amount of strawberries?
Exactly what I've been looking for. No gelatin or all that fancy stuff and simple as well as a small batch. Great and thanks
Tysm for this recipe , I’m on my way to bighit ent. To feed JIMIN his jams 😊
I've used your recipe and the jam is delicious, thanks for the video :). The colour is also beautiful, light and fruity
Ok so mine was great but then when it cooled it got very hard what did I do wrong
I did this recipe and it was amazing, but my jam got too stiff, I was hoping to be a little more liquid to be easier to spread on my toast. What did Indo wrong? Too much time on the stove? Can I add a little bit of water now to dissolve?
excellent video - very well explained.  Thank you 😍🍓
I just made some today and they are awesome!
Small batch: 2 lbs... I buy strawberries in 0.5 lbs packages, that’s a small batch for me. I’ll reduce the recipe by 4 and try this, looks really simple and delicious.
I think i got jams for Jimin!
Could u reduce this recipe to make 1 ounce of it
جميلة جدا هو حضرتك مش ما بتنزعش الرغاوي اللي على الفراوله ليه
I,m Egypt l like
Can u pls give us the ingredients in kg or grams pls?!
Can i use frozen berries
Thank you this recipe is fantastic  love it
Can this be made with sugar substitute?  What texture differences are there.
yummy
I made this today with strawberries from my sisters strawberry patch, she passed away November 2020 from COVID. It’s kind of special since I won’t ever be going back to her house.
I've used this recipe 4 times now. Three times for strawberry jam and once for raspberry. They all came out fantastic! I love not needing a candy thermometer or using pectin. It firms up just fine and tastes great!
Can  U tell me how to make strawberry jelly
Wow very nice sir thanks
Can brown sugar be used instead of white sugar and if yes will it still have a good taste as well?
Today i make this
what should I do if I added some water like a ¼ cup ???
감사합니다~^^
I love how you make everything simpler ♥️ thank you for sharing
I went to the desert farms yesterday and got 4 kilos of strawberry for 9$ and I'm so excited!! usually strawberrys are so expensive at the grocery store and now I'm going to try alll the strawberry recipes, I'm making shortcake and with whats left when im done i will make this jam <3
"Once it starts sticking at the bottom, it's OVER."  Me still stirring the jam while some of it are sticking at the bottom: 👁️👄👁️💦 you can't see me, i know you can't see me.
This video made me so freaking happy. ❤️ I’m going to go make some jam now.✨
Nice👍
Love this racepi
You forgot to add some margarine not margarita into your toast ceiling, I mean your CABEZA DE GUEBO
I love this was easy  and the after results is good i made it and its good even my mom likes it and she don't really like sweet stuff
Do you have other vids of making jam?
I am making it today can i mention you on my instagram on how well it came out 🥰🥰🥰
can i use brown sugar instead of white sugar?
Just a tip:  If you take the strawberries and sugar (at the beginning) and mash them up with a masher, they make an excellent ice cream topping.  Just a thought if you want to cut up a little extra to set aside.  Your jam  recipe is what was used when I was a kid.  Huge batches were made, then poured into canning jars and sometimes just freezer safe bowls, then frozen for longer storage.
Would it be possible to replace sugar with honey?
Very easy method of making Strawberry Jam
I mix mine with milk sometimes! So good!!!
Excellent
Perfect jam recipe thank you so much for sharing have made it so many times we love it
Wow i would like to use a xylitol sugar
one cup sugar in grams?
this video should be call "HOW TO MAKE CANCER"
If anyone of you were to make this for your business what would you do or use to allow the jam to last longer??
I made the jam yesterday ,but today after a night in the fridge, its very difficult to spread
my life was changed by this jam.....
Good how many days save it
Wow
i made this and i just made 4 slices of toast and homeade strawberry milk its so good omg
Brilliant! While he was stirring, I thought that hot beautiful mixture would be good over butter pecan ice cream.
That seems like more sugar than anyone should have
Has anyone tried this with splenda maybe 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda ?
Jam-making is bad for you. It screws up the way you talk. Fast, fastest, fastest still....bah! What bad delivery. How many can catch what he is talking about?
Had made strawberry jam before, but will try your way to keep it more fruity/pulpy
Can someone tell me how much sugar in grams is this?
How many days will it last
Looks amazing. I am looking at the very expensive strawberry conserves in the shops (very tasty, but expensive), and I am thinking about trying out this recipe instead.
OMG I luv you and your channel.  I’m going to be featuring your strawberry jam recipe on my IG @city_girl_gone_green  I’ll be adapting the quantities but I’ll be sure to tag you and give you all the credit   Are you on IG I’d luv to follow you there too 😊
I made this yesterday and wow. Legit the best tasting plain strawberry jam I’ve ever had. I did process the jars (two half pint and one 4 ounce jar which were all perfect for the yield) with the water bath method. Also, this was the first time I’ve ever made jam and your instructions were easy to follow and accurate. I really appreciate how you walked us through the process and especially your descriptions of the texture changes. Thank you.
BTS:   *Sends to jimin*
I followed your recipe and my jam turned out AMAZINGG its taste so sweet and it was the best I ever taste thanks for the recipe
Very straight forward instructions, thank you. Why is it necessary to keep the jars hot before transferring the jam? What is the equipment you are referring to that "most people don't have it" when you were transferring the jam to the jars?
Ett
Just tried it a whike ago 😍😋 easy yet yummy ! Thank you ❣️
I stan the jimin comments guys😂
I tried to do this and it turned so good I like it so much it's not too sweet. I have to make again today. Thank you so much for sharing. 😊🙏God bless.
Nice and simple recipe 👍👏
The melon baller use here is brilliant. Im looking for an answer to a question: can I make strawberry jam from store bought berries? Ive only made blackberry jam;  from berries Ive picked (Oregonian lol) but heard store bought berries won't work for jam. Its winter. No choice.. Have a preschooler that only likes strawberry jam (att) but would love some he made w grammy most, and would be so much healthier too
Nice recipe 😍   But I never store my jam in the fridge and I have never had any go bad...and I make exactly the same way you did.
تحفه تسلم ايدك ما شاء الله
is it okay to dice the fruits in smaller smaller pieces so we don't have to do some crushing on the fruits while cooking it?
Just Blend the Strawberrys
I found this at my homepage I think Jimin really need his jams back...
Cook it on lower heat and reduce the sugar in half, then perfect
Can I add lime juice instead of lemon?  I can’t find yellow lemons where I am!   Or squeeze half an orange instead ??
No I don’t think you understand I actually hate my fandom like can YouTube army’s please shut up omg
Thank you so much for this video 📹.
Can you tell me the equal measurement of cups for gram? Thank you
I don't like jam  I love strawberry
i made rasberry jam today cant tell you how good it was 2 lemons and their zest was enough lemon for me cuz guess who put too much sugar? me!
I was, just wondering if it safe while too hot and put it in jar and sealed it.  Can i wait at least make it completely cool before i cover it
the jar is so beautiful and adds that special ooh la la to the appearance of the jam
Can I use frozen fruit?
Awesome 👏🏻
Omg army is so annoying
I reduced the sugar to half and it worked just fine!
Best and easy I made strawberry Jam !!!    And I love it thank you so much   😊
Hi wats does the lemon juice for
Do you cover the lid while it hot?
Can this be left out instead of in the fridge
Strawberries are natural afrodesiacs🙏
Love from India (kerala)😍🥰👍👍👍👍
Thank you for the video, I did try with frozen strawberries, but the jams tend to spoil within a week or even earlier with white layer of fungus forming on the top. Please help
What if you don’t add sugar?
I came to find the army comments cause I knew they’d be here and now I’m actually interesting in the jam, I’m gonna make some :)
can i water bath this to make it last on a shelf til next summer when strawberry time is here or even pressure cooker can this recipe my frige space is small.
Thank you very much for your great explanation
Thank you for sharing. I'll make it today. 😊God Bless🙏
I can't with Army's anymore HAHAGA
why mine's turned out like candy?
The strawberries in my region are sour, I heard that the northern strawberries are very sweet and fragrant.
عاشت ايدك lam from Iraq good 😍😍
It e sugar diabites ho  jaege
Very nice strawberry  jam 🍓
Thank you!!  Such a simple recipe ... Tried it out, came out deliciously perfect!
*lmao for the haters telling us to shut up about Jimin's Jams and jam itself, please shush your mouth lol!! We're having fun!! Chill tf out, and ignore it since it bothers you. Anyway I found Jimin's jams lol!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂*
👍🏻
This was super helpful, thank you! Going to attempt this rn😁
잘 보고 갑니다.
I plan to make this. Thanks for the recipe.
Is the lemon juice for flavor or does it have another purpose?
it was great thankyou sm 😁
Can I use frozen strawberries instead
Can we use less sugar?
Can this be used with kiwis or any other berry?
How would I do this if I’m trying to make seedless blackberry jam? Would I still cost in sugar and let sit or strain and then add sugar after ? Thank you!
Can I make half of this quantity. Thanks for your recipe. It looks great.
Thank you
Does it always take 2 cups of sugar.. could you get a better taste of the fruit without 2cups ?
Like
Can this be used for cakes? I'm trying to make a strawberry shortcake but instead of just whipped cream, I wanna add some jam in the middle layer but I'm worried itll run and ruin the marange and make the sponge cake too juicy
this is so great, I'm using a different fruit, but so far it's working!!
We only need  Strawberry,sugar,lemon juice.😊
Lemon seeds fell in it. Pit them or strain them
I love it and I will make it thank you God Bless
Great tutorial!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
veruthe kothippikkan vendi, adipoliyaayittund keetto
Made this today. So simple and very very yummy
Excellent video so inspiring and the outcome, mouth watering....
That's exactly how I make it. And most timesI add something else, like Vanilla, Cinnamon, Rum, Red wine etc. Just get creative.
Thank you for good recipe. It was easy to understand. I will make today.
i will make it but not with that much sugar🤢  my stomach would hurt so bad
I’ve put a hot liquid into a glass that wasn’t hot before...😅 thanks for boiling water the advice! I was a little scared for the water to break my glass so I did it gradually😂
This is actually a really good recipe y'all try it out for real        do I know the jams meme? yes. am I an army? kinda, if you get rid of the involvement with the fandom part. I just love the boys, that's all. Is the joke old? It's getting there. And it would really favor yall to stop commenting so much about old things on random videos. Not saying it's wrong, it's just advice because you never know who might not like that. Imagine you making a jam video and coming to the comments hoping for critique or compliments, and then all you get is a barrage of comments from some not even related fandom. It's kinda disrespectful. So keep to a minimum, for the sake of the boys and army. Please.    ANd EAT THIS JAM I SWEAR ITS SO GOOD
How do you process it?
Thank you for this recipe I didn't really use it for cooking but I use it for my project
Salivating! 😋
Joshua xips 2
Can I use brown sugar instead?
Ah, yes, works wonders. If it takes a bit too long to harden and turn more jammy (over 25-35 minutes), try adding about a teaspoon more sugar. It helps a lot! The jam is delicious, it’s so easy and amazing on a peanut butter jelly.
Awesome trying this tomorrow
imagine a non-army scrolling through these comments...theyd think the world has gone mad          now jimin come get your jams back
Wow beautiful thank you so much. U made so easy to make.
Great! I make lemon curd and yogurt. I wanted to also make jam for my yogurt.
My fam smashes it
i wanted to listen to some jam, and this will do
just reminding the army's that the jimin's jams jokes are lowkey rude :)
Awesome  STRAWBERRY  Jam
Do you hv to turn the freshly poured jam jars upside down?!!!
Super !!!!!
I’ve never been so confused in reading the comment section, and then I realised it’s just “armies” and their inside jokes
Lmao jam is just the weight of the fruit matched with sugar
metric too please...
10% wow thanks for the recipe 90% hey jimin we've FoUnD your JaMs            (btw i'm in 90🤣)
How long does it take to expire?
how about apples?
*JIMIN!!!! FOUND ITTT!!!!*
Can I use raw sugar instead of granulated for this recipe?
Looks great .. would be lovely to get the metric measurements too
Looks delicious
i am going to make a lot of this and give them to JIMINIE MY BABY   Our fandom needs a doctor
I'm sure this has been said somewhere in the 2k comments, but you can turn the jars upside down once the rings are on tight, and they'll likely pop/secure themselves just as if you had put them in a water bath. That is - if the jars were super hot as well as the lids and the jam. Very helpful on the sound of the boiling changing.
Thank you so much for showing how to make Strawberry jam I think I might give it a go with a friend ☺
Why give lemon juice?
You said subscribe, and surely did! Great, healthy recipe which everybody should know about. Thank you!
I swear Army's are everywhere
👍
I love your video. You were very descriptive. I am totally blind and I totally understood the video. Most people don't do that
The amount of sugar though 😨
Can I make this with Splenda or other non-sugar sweetener?  My husband is diabetic and can’t have sugar.  Tfs.
I make mine the same way,  but with very little sugar,  maybe 1/4 cup, and I let it simmer slowly.   It takes longer,  and it needs to be stored in the frig and the freezer,  but it is SOOO good.
I’ll be canning this for some long winters. Thank you very much 🙏🏻❤️
Jimin has approved
I made this and my family loved it! I made 3 half pint jars 3 months ago and they didn’t stand a chance in my house. I’m referring back to the video to make more. ❤️🙌🏾
Nice 🍓jam
Miss you crouton!
I tried this & it was so tasty!!
Wow thank you for showing us this recipe, I can’t wait to make it.  It looks super delicious 😋 awesome video, very clear and easy to follow
Thanks for the tutorial!! Going to try this today so excited.. tired of spending $10 @ the store 🤣
can i use 1/2 the sugar ?
Me: mom! Let's make jam! :D  Mom: *we can buy it on the supermarket*  :,)
حلو تحمست اسويه😍💓💓💓
Do you put more water in it?
That is a shitton of sugar lol
make me now friend pls

Hey take a break from the “Jimin” comments and talk about cottagecore lesbian stuff with me
Hi.   I just made strawberry jam according to your recipe, but the results were not so good. I mean, my "jam" looked like marmalade since there where pieces of strawberries in there.  So, what suggestions could you give me for the next time I would be making another strawberry jam without any pieces of fruit?
Can organic honey replace sugar?
Wow that was easy
Good video! I also made a blueberry blackberry raspberry jam myself few weeks back. Blackberries picking is great now in western WA state so I'm making things with them currently. But will have to give this strawberry jam a try. Wow what planet are we on these comments and fandoms and all that ? Get off YouTube go do something lol make jam. Anything. Just quit living your life in a comment thread 😂
I made it turned out great        BTW JIMIN got Jams     Ok i am leaving now
Strawberries just went on sale yesterday!!!! Making this today
And my jam is tastier 😋 😋😋
thanks for the jam tho! im making it rn lets see how it goesss
oml istg these bts stans :(
So simple...thank you
Tried this recipe today!!!.. Perfect.. Yummm.. Thank you 👍😊
It’ll be my first time trying this out , so I wanna start with a cup of strawberries, will the proportion be a cup of strawberries : a cup of sugar and juice of half a lime ?
Hey! I love the video and recipe but i don't understand how much sugar should i put. Someone can save my Jam on it's way at the moment and tell me how many grams do i need to put for 1kg of strawberry? Thanks a lot
If I ever meet jimin I'm going to make some jam for him
I love that you're using a melon baller to core the strawberries ! Great idea !!! 💯 I'll be stealing it thank you !!! 😋🥰
I dont understand the need for a thermometer anyhow. How the hell do you think people made jams and jellies and even candies before a thermometer was INVENTED???
This is probably a stupid question, but I know nothing about cooking haha. Would this need to be refrigerated? Since it’s essentially a candy I assume not, but it’s still using fruit so I just wanted to make sure. Thanks
I make this delicious strawberry jam and was a success... thank you for your recipe.. now I'm doing peaches instead of berries I hope it turns out good..😬
This looks amazing! How long does it stay good for in the refrigerator?
this was very delicious. cant wait to try it on ice cream. thank you CC
Just like my granny taught me how to make.  Delicious
Thank you for the recipe. I tried making it and loving it. I will never buy strawberry jam again. Homemade is always better.❤️😍👍🏻
•How do u know it’s gonna be sticking and burning on the bottom???• cause I am gonna make it :3
Thanks looks so. easy to make the jam time to shopping for Strawberries 😁
Thanks for the recipe.  Can you please tell me why it has to be refridgerated if it hasn't been opened?  I make relish and just tip the jars upside down as soon as I've sealed them and let them cool.  They seal air tight and I just put them in my pantry until I open them.  I'm just curious to know why I can't do the same with the jam?  I'm loving being educated by everyone. :)
THEEEE BEST jam making video on YouTube!! All the other videos SUCK! Thank you mister! 😊
Love the recipe 😍 want to know if this can be made with stevia instead of sugar
Um when he dumped 20 teaspoons of shuger
this is why everyone hates armys bruh
Can I skip the lemon juice?
just made it....it is perfection!!
I’m on a keto diet, I’ve made it but instead I have substituted the sugar with erythritol powder and it turned out beautifully!!! It taste amazing, better the one u buy ready!!! Will definitely recommend.
Hi how long the shelf life of this
No mention of shelf life? :(
Rip my english.
Thank you, thank you, thank you! This recipe is too great for people that are vegan
Thanks for this, finally, I can make my own jam, take care my friend, see you too, God bless
I just tried this recipe and wow I'm just surprised at the outcome! It was so good that everyone in the family ate even we all already had dinner! No joke guys! I even used washed sugar and not the white granulated version and it was soo good! Thaanks so much for sharing this! Love it!
How many jars does these measurements fill? I'm only planning on making one hand-sized jar, how would I split these measurements?
Thx  dia
Just finished making. Came out perfect!!!! Thank you!!!!  Beautiful
I came here thinking I would find cottagecore lesbians and I found army’s... and I’m not complaining lol (I’m army too)
Thank you so much for sharing Strawberry Jam receipy,  I made Strawberry jam too but after watching your video it's improve my knowledge 😃
This recipe was so easy to follow. Made my own jam for the first time and it tastes sooooo good. Will defo not be buying jam again!!
Easy method ! Simple & perfect instructions !👌
jimin, i found ur lost jams 🗿🗿🗿
I reallyyyy wanna try this now omgg
This recipe turned out great! Although I don’t think I followed a single step exactly. I used a much larger pot with much fewer berries. Powdered sugar instead of granulated and I added some rosè wine since my strawberries were a chopped a couple days ago and a touch drier than this video’s. Even with the differences I ended with a delicious jam. 10/10 give it a go
Is it weird that I hate strawberries but I love strawberry flavored stuff? Just like how I hate the taste of coffee but love the smell of it
This sounds perfect thank you mr Crouton
Guys I honestly love this fandom but please stop commenting about jimin’s jams. First it’s a dead meme ( well it is to me) second people want to actually see if this actually works! Like me! It’s very annoying for some people so please stop with the same comments and make it enjoyable for everyone please
How can I send this to Jimin
Wish I found this recipe first ☹  This would have saved me a ton of money.
I ate strawberries like once in my life lol
Wanted to read some comments about people's luck with this recipe but Jesus Christ!  Weirdos
Can be used to flavor cupcake mix?
10 out of 10 I tried it out and it was the best strawberry jam I’ve ever tasted in my life.
Can splenda be used as a sugar substitute for the same kind of results?
I wonder if I can make apple jam with this recipe?
Quick tip use a spoon not your finger to test if the jam is ready with the plate. I learned the hard way, other than that great recipe
Looks amazing. Thanks for sharing! 🌸👍🏻
Good recipe for strawberry jam!
Hi, can i use brown sugar instead of white?
Can I make this recipe with sour cherries?
Thank you so much. I will try to do it this weekend.
Jimin coming here to try and get jams
Can you use honey instead of sugar and if so how much?
How much time to set aside for this?
Once I put it in the fridge it got super hard 😞
Excuse me how much time will it take?
does this work with apricots or oranges?
i just made this and its AMAZING.
Cool, I always wanted to try Jims Jam. I just hope I'll know when its ready.
You’ve been really helpful for firstimer like me thankyou😊
Wow! I think I found Jimins Jams!!
YUM! I love this!!!
Dummy thicc
You can make sugar free jam with just strawberries and chai seeds
I found Jimin's Jams 😅
I have this a try, came out very tasty!
This is a fantastic how-to! Thank you soo much. Berrie season is here and I'll be putting this to practice ASAP<3
Looks easy and amazing!  I can’t wait to make this. 🥰
Way too much sugar. The perfect ratio for me is 3 parts berry, 1 part sugar.
I don't have cans so I will let it cool and then put in plastic containers in the fridge.  Does this get watery at all if it's in the fridge without being canned??  Can I freeze it in plastic containers??
My mum loves to have little victorian themed tea party's with me, so I'll definitely show her this recipe next time! It looks and sounds great! Perfect for my mum's British scones :) thank you!
What is 'chunked' strawberries?  Do you need 1lb of strawberries straight up or 1lb hulled & halved strawberries?
idk anything about koop. someone pls explain how this video relates
Very delicious! Would recommend though, for future videos, to put the prep items at the start of the video? Specifically, freezing the plate, and heating the jam jars.
How long can you store it?
Saw this video last night and decided to try it out. Very simple yet so delicious. I personally think it tastes a lot better than store bought. No more buying from the store from now on 😊👌🏼😎
Oh goodness! Thanks! This looks like a lovely recipe!!
Can I use this same process for peaches/apricots/figs?
Man I luv this channel 😋
How would you put ruba
Just made it!!
* Jimin has entered the chat * I want my jams back >:(
Idk if anybody will ever see this but u can add this jam recipe into milk and it makes rlly good strawberry milk :0
could you use sweetener/artificial sugar instead of regular sugar?
Tried it yesterday and it turned out amazing, thanks for recipe
Why is lemon juice needed?
Can you process this after you put it in the jars
can this jam recipe put in the cupboard until it is opened and then put it in the refrigerator?
I don’t known why i thoughts this was going to healthy silly me
Sounds incredibly simple and doable with the way you explain step by step ... great job ... loving it ... going to make it right away
wait, since the play is in the freezer and you put the hot preserves on there, won't it break the plate?
Hi is it possible to sift the strawberry jam?
When u say candy thermometer  what is that use for
Awesome  what is the name of the jars so I can find the exact jars on amazon  I love organic jam instead of processing the jam
Thank you for the great video, good job!
I have a better Idea for Strawberryjam, you should take about 12 Senga Sengana Strawberries, and fill up with Wild Strawberries untill it's about 400g, then put some water in and normal sugar, it will taste soooo good like strawberries
With that amount of sugar, of course it turned out good. Disgusting though, nonetheless - can definitely make nice jam with far less sugar....
This is soo cool. Thanku🙏
My mom made wild strawberry Jam. A big field of them were just directly across the street from our house. It was a family project to go pick as many as we could.
Hi do we refrigerate them immediately or wait till bottle is cool?
Tried and amazed by the resut. Thank you for this amazing recipe 🙏🏻
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Does any one knows if the jam would still be good if I ship it another country by postal service (it would take max 7 days)?
For others that made this recipe- about how much did you end up with? I just made it and I only ended up with about one 500ml jar worth, I’m worried maybe I cooked it too long? But it wasn’t setting up. 2 pounds of strawberries into one jar seems like a small yield to me but I’ve never made something like this before. edit: I watched it over again and he mentions a pint, so a quick look online tells me I did in fact make just a little bit less than he did! Never mind!
Oh wow
Just made this today & it was *FANTASTIC!!!*  My only regret is that I didn’t triple the recipe!! We’re a family of 6 so this small batch won’t last us a week!! 🤣😂🤣  I loved that it was 3 simple ingredients but it truly tastes amazing!! I cannot wait to make blueberry jam now ❤️❤️❤️
how many jars did u get from the 2 lbs strawberry?
Just made it. Took me 30-45 min with cleaning and everything and it came out delicious (ate some warm...lol)
Clear and to-the-point explanation from start to end. 👏 Thanks a lot. Looks too delicious. 👍 Am definitely going to try.
Oh, thank you so much looking forward to trying this today. Because, I just got a whole batch of strawberries home grown and I wanted to try something different this time. Your recipe looks so easy and yummy thank you again. Definitely will be making one for my son he’s in the Military and he loves strawberries... I’m so happy right now thank you.. And thanks to a few reviews I see it’s going to also be great.. Thank You Crouton Cracker Jacks..
What would have been the reason for pectin or gelatin
I just started making donuts and this, this will be inside my donuts. Thank you.
Can i use cherries instead of strawberries in this recipe?
What is BTS? What is Fandom? What is Cottagecore? I like strawberry jam! 🍓
Great and easy Recipe. Specific instructions well done. Thank you.
Awesome that it's without  special tools and super well described 👍😊🍓
Can this recipe be used to make Java Plum Jam?
Can I use frozen berries for this recipe?
Can this be further processed to be shelf stable in a canner?
Can this be freeze dried?
🤪🤩👍
Does this work with Dingle-berries?!
If you are using this recipe with blueberries do you need to cut up the blueberries
i loved this recipe so much
I tried this & it also works really good with some honey 🍯👍🏼
Just found this video and tried this recipe today, it turned out beautifully!!!  Highly recommend this recipe, thanks so much!!!
What kind of substitutes sugar to replace the granulated sugar for diabetic person. I like the process of this jam.
OMG - This recipe Works - Delish!
What the heck is everyone talking about BTS and Fandom and stuff , all I found here is a strawberry Jam recipe
I'm late to this fandom but I came here to say:    Jimin, you got no jams
Thank you for posting so delicious recipe!
Made this like a year ago, turned out perfect, IM BACK FOR MORE. JAMJAMAJAMJAM.
These people are like the Jojo fandom of jam.
Thank you for the easy to follow recipe with key points! I translated this recipe into Korean for my parents and they are quite excited to make fresh jam with the berries they've grown!
They last 6 months?? Haha lol.  Yeah, I don't think they would last more than a week in my fridge.
Thank you very much I just made this and it came out wonderfully only problem was it was a small batch lol
Making right now  Thank u for sharing
Thanks!  :)
I’ve never made jam before and I thought this would be perfect to start with. It’s amazing!! When you say you’ll know when it’s done. You really do.
Okay.  I’ve massacred my strawberries for 2hr.  I hope that’s not a bad thing lol.  I got out in the garden and lost track of time.  So they have been massacred and I’m boiling my jars.  I’ll be using a water bath because I tripled this recipe (and will do it again once I’m done.  Ack!  We went to a “you pick” farm and we all got a basket...not realizing how HUGE the baskets were!  So....lots of jam.  I also gave a bunch away!   Love the simplicity of this recipe and I can vaguely remember my gran doing the same thing.
Wow..
Can I use honey instead of sugar
Can I make this with erythriol?
Would this work with fox grapes?
Does spenda work other than sugar?
My bro is such a G I highly advise u 2 try this jam out
Made this today! Excellent results. Definitely recommend this recipe.
EXCITED....will try this week and follow back up.
Curious to know if I want to process it for water bath canning how long would I need to process it after cooking and canning the mixture?
I just finishing my jam and I can guarantee for the serious viewers...this is a life changing recipe 😍😍😍😍😍👌 my jam was on point and is soooo easy to make. Thank you so much for sharing this with us!!
My strawberries are macerating on the counter right now, can’t hardly wait! 💕
As we know.. Is That healthy or harming  A lot of sugar put in
Nice but DON'T overcook! It gets way too hard and impossible to get out of the jar
Ouu looks beautiful! I'm really in the mood for sugar jelly donuts. I prefer homemade jams than store bought. THANK YOU SM FOR THIS RECIPE!!!
Can i ask, how many days i can store this one?
2 pound in grams how much
IM making this for my mom for Mother day! I hope it turns out well
Love it
I'm trying this recipe with cherries.
"Can I make this with other berries?"   No.    It won't be strawberry jam any more.
Jeez bud. Got sugar???
I am an Army too but u guys need to like stop.Because of this our fandom is getting toxic. Just appreciate the recipe
I love this video!!
Can i use brown sugar?
Spot on!  Excellent video. Speaks slowly so you’re not having to back up and hear what he said again. Had a gallon of strawberries and it produced 8 jelly jars. Start to finish including washing, cutting, cooking took about 2 hours but had to do two batches to make sure it didn’t bubble out of the pot by trying to do all at once. No biggie. CoVid stay at home! What else do I have to do!!!!!  Jars are cooling now but I snuck a taste. Yummmmmmm. A big thumbs up from me here in NC!
For me...any recipes from him is a full proof! Wishing he would gives more of his time for us. I always waiting to see his video. I pray that you're in good health and be safe! Nooh🐀
Excellent recipe!  I made strawberry jam this morning and it turned out great!  Thanks :-)
Thank you so much for the recipe!
Is it ok if I dint use lemon juice? Or will it affect the way it comes out?
I am interesting to make aloevera jam, can you learn it to me? It is really vital. Please
Just made this recipe for myself. Turned out excellent!!
I made this recipe and I’m IN LOVE!! I’ve given it to my grandparents and my boyfriend’s family and they all love it!! It takes a while for the strawberries to completely boil, but it’s completely worth it! I’m going to try it with peaches next!!
Would it work just fine if I use pineapple instead?
Thank yoy
Wow that was good, I also have a simple recipe on strawberry jam on my channel check it out 😊
Made it! And it was great! Thank you 👍🏼👍🏼
That looks so good but I suck at cooking and will probably burn now my kitchen
Did it for the first time with leftover frozen strawberries which taste sour and bitter by itself . Turns out, my sister says taste like our fav jam which we used to buy from supermarkets! Sucess! Thanks for sharing!!
I made this with my 5 year old and it came out so good. I have a question about figs though, would you do the same?
Took me a little longer to get it to thicken, but turned out great for my first jam attempt - thank you!
Wonderful video- what do you mean by process?
Hi, how long does the jam keep, unopened (stored in a cupboard) - and how long can it keep, once opened, stored in the fridge please?  Thanks
I've used this recipe/instructions along with your banana nut bread recipe, and they both turn out amazing every single time! Thank you so much! I only have 1 question though.. as I've made this small batch jam several times now...  it might be easier (for as much jam as my family gos through) for me to just make more at one time and process it in canning jars! Is it possible to do the canning process with this exact recipe or will I need to add pectin or anything else? Please let me know what you think! Thank you!🙂
Thankyou for this recipe its 100 percent organic ,no preservatives good for health  gonna try  it out soon cant wait looks too good
Recipe looks amazing. Can lemon be replaced by something else ? Thanks.
Yum 😋
I made dew berry jam! I’m very excited to try it tomorrow!!
Are Jimin a jams here
I made this batch yesterday since at the stores I can’t find any and omg 😱 the best I loved it and I was so happy I made a couple of them more  I really loved this jam
1 kg strawberries jam how many sugar and lemon requirement?
To make half the amount (2 jars) Could we just cut the ingredients in half?
Why the frick are y’all making everything about bts???
I made it. Had my 9, 6, and 3 year old babies taste it. Now I have to hide it from them. It’s delicious 😋
Don’t mind me making jam for mochi
I am literally here for quarantine but I'm shookt all I see was my co ARMY. This fandom really. I kenat.😂
Jfc i just came here to learn how to make strawberry jam...crazy koreaboos
Apple jam ?
That's awesome but, how long does it last without adding preservative?
I tried this tonight and it turned out great! Thank you so much for the recipe. Was happy to find a “small batch” aka a normal sized amount option. Everything else was like 15lbs if strawberries lol. I followed this exactly and it was a lot easier than I anticipated. I just kept stirring the entire time, switching arms lol. It yielded about 20oz for me. I will make my own jam going forward
can we substitute the sugar with honey?
do you store it in the fridge when its hot or wait for it to cool?
Woow this is a wonderful recipe and simple procedure, thanks for teaching me how to make strawberry jam.
i just made this, it’s so delicious!!! thank u for the video ❤️ one thing, mine didnt make any foam while cooking!! O: i was waiting for it to help me tell when it would be done cooking, but it never happened, do you know why this might be? i did make a smaller batch though
Yumcious yummy 😋😃
Those fans are really crazy like wtf 🤮
Thank you
WE FOUND JIMIN’S JAMS. WE’VE DONE IT BOYS WE GOT THE HIGH GROUND.
I took the recipe and cut it in half. 1 pound strawberries and 1 cup sugar.. still used 1 half of a lemon.. came out exactly like the recipe in the video.. thank you
OMG. My kids devoured the first batch. I am making my second batch in a week. I don’t think I will ever buy store-bought jelly again
Made this today. Turned out great. Had loads of strawberries left, which I bough for Daiquiris on the weekend, they would've even up in the bin. First time making Jam, and it's very tasty.
I'm no expert but it looks good to me
Super excited thanks
Hi, I'm planning to make this jam now, but I have a quick question. I recently moved and can't find my canning jars. Can I store this jam in a Tupperware dish instead, or does it have to be a glass jar?
why did you add lemon juice to it; can it be made without lemon juice?
Jimin ssi
Why is mine as hard as a rock?
This came out awesome! And so easy too. Using this for some homemade biscuits tomorrow :)
I made blueberry and apple jam the other day, I usually like to use Bramley cooking apples because they turn into an apple sauce consistency but I only had gala apples so I grated them to stretch the amount of blueberries I had.....delicious!  A favourite jame in England is apple and blackberry. Usually the same amount of apples to blackberries so 1 kilo (2.2llb) of each and the same of sugar and you have a huge amount of jam. For those who don't know...Pears, apples, guavas, quince, plums, gooseberries, and oranges, lemons  and other citrus fruits contain large amounts of pectin, while soft fruits, like cherries, grapes, and strawberries, contain small amounts of pectin. So you don't need pectin jam and it was the lemon juice which helped to thicken the strawberry jan.
Hey jimin you got no JaMs
Omggg I tried this recipe, best jam ever 🙏🏽
Great video!
Would this work with making a pepper jelly such as habanero or jalapeno?
Excellent video 👍
Sarap naman. Bilihin ko yong isang jar haha.
Two cups of sugar per two pounds pouds of berries :O Its like half the volume
If I freeze the jam, will it defrost and still be good?
Thank you for the recipe I just made it and it was so delicious thank you so much
Holy shit, I read 1 pound of strawberries and 2 pounds of sugar...
My Grandma used to add a tablespoon of butter to reduce the foam.
This tasted great! But I over boiled it... I made hard candy
Does it work with any type of sugar? Brown? Dark brown/Cane? or Coconut?
yeah, this good recipe.  I try a different recipe on my channel but I think I should try this one too.
Thank you for the ingredients chef!! What preservatives can you use if you want to keep it for long?
Can I use frozen fruit
The most successful strawberry jam making I have seen so far. I wish I had come across this video before .
Jimin where u at
Wohooo it came out incredibly perfect. This is the first time I am posting a comment but believe me the fruitful result have urged me to do it. Lots of thanks from Pakistan.
This is great video...but can we use brown sugar instead?

How's if without sugar?
Boris has 2 ingeredient jam.
I'm here from a cottagecore playlist not whatever bts inside joke y'all keep making
How many jam can produce of 2lbs strawberries?
I will definitely try this
I just made it! Thank you!! It is delicious. Can I do the same thing with other fruits?

I made with  blackberries. So delicious!
so this is where jimins jams have been
Thank u sir
Brilliant! Love it!!
I came to see recipe and I noticed there’s a bunch of meme fiends here looks like I’m two years late lol
This's the most adorable jam I've ever prepared, this recipe is awesome, I tried it yest. on3 Kg of Strawberries  with adjusted amount of sugar & lemon juice to suit the amount, & I made the most perfect jam I've ever made in my life , my whole family admired the recipe, everything is adjusted perfectly , the colour, the consistency, the taste , the strawberry pieces, the amount of sugar to lemon juice ...everything is great...I'm a super super fan with the recipe & the product....Everyone should try it!
If strawberry are already sour then we skip lemon juice
Could you use coconut sugar with this recipe?
Do you have a ginger preserve jam, chunky?
Can you get the recipe to print?
Uhhh. Just came here for the recipe. Shoo army
JIMIN, YOURE JAMS!
Jimin f*ck this jam... Uwu catch
The lemon balanced the sweetness tnx for the tip
It's was fantastic explain neatly to do  thanks very much 👍🙏🙌
Will this work for peppers?? I need to know!
What the hell? Why are there so many BTS fans here?
Too much sugar?
How does one process this kind of jam for longer shelf life?
I love this!!! You have a soothing voice. Some people I can’t even watch because of their voice. You also give amazing detail tips!!! I can’t wait to make this! So it will last 6 months in the fridge?? Opening and closing?
why are there a bunch of bts fans in the comments, i’m just trying to make some jam y’all 😭
Please excuse my fandom lmfao
Could it with pineapple?
It's good for Jimin because he got NO jams
Thank you!  I wanted a how-to for strawberry jam that wasn't a lot unnecessary steps and frills.   Strawberries just went on sale at my grocery store and I loaded up!
I love this fandom 😂💜
Superb recipe ...wow thanks 👍👍👍👍
me: how do I know when it’s ready crouton: you’ll know me: uh w-what crouton: shshshhh you’ll know ;)
Hi, could you do this jam with frozen berries?
Can you use this same recipe with apples?
Imma make this for jimin
Just made this after seeing ur video. Turned out awesome! Mom said tastes exactly store bought!
I’ve been making jam using this method for months and it comes out delicious every time!!❤️❤️💕❤️👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽😊😊
*Can you make an extra batch for jimin? He needs some*
Will this work with grapes jam?
I moved to China from the US about 6 months ago and I've been trying to cook more. There's this guy who sells DELICIOUS strawberries on my way home, but it's SO MANY strawberries. I thought I'd start trying to make jam. This video is PERFECT  because I have none of the equipment. I've got my strawberries in sugar right now, so hopefully this goes well! Might not end up being 'proper jam' but it'll be good!
I wonder if he is like who the fuck is jimin
idk man....will this jam be good for jimin?
Can u do this with any berry?
Jimin! The Army's Have Found Ur Jams!!!
Don’t add too much SUGA to JIMINS JAMS   😂😂   ok i’ll leave now....
Just remember, 'macerating' your strawberries too much can make them go blind.
I’m still forgetting about that bts meme about jams
whos got time to stir for 80 min lol
Dear god, if I see one more BTS comment, I'll pour a gallon of bleach in my eyes.
*i was here to make jimin's jam o-o*
Don’t worry ARMY I’ll tell Jimin
IM LEAVING THE GODDAMN FANDOM THIS IS IT
Tried this recipe and it turned out great. Tastes amazing. Will definitely be using this recipe again soon. Thanks for sharing.
I made this jam... I had some leftover strawberries which were not so sweet... I didn't want to waste them so searched for jam videos... This was the easiest and tastiest jam i could ever make and it's without any preservatives so better than store bought ones...
I prefer scones
Remove the foam as it makes your jam spoil fast
Thanks for sharing. You mentioned processing. How would you preserve for longer?
Love how natural! Also how I don't want this much so how do I reduce?
Works 👌 for me, such a satisfying  video ❤️❤️
love love this and how simple it is to make. No more fake jelly for me lol Thank you
*_I'd make some for Jimin..._*
i did it right once was great, this time it turned out like a hard fruit rollup or something what did i do wrong
y’all bts fans are too much i just wanna make strawberry jam
love it can't wait
That looks good! Thanks so much
Can I use brown sugar instead of white?
Yes !!!!! Omg this is amazing thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!!!
ARMYs in their natural habitat
I made this recipe with a mixture of nectarines, apples and blueberries. It turned out amazing! Thanx for the video
I recently was given some homemade Strawberry Super Hot Pepper jam and fell in love.  Do you know if I need to do anything special, if I want to add peppers to this recipe?
This is very delicious! Thank you so much!
Wonderful recipe! TY I'm so proud of the results, delicious!
It's time to make Jiminy jams
Yummy
I’m done with this fandom.
Will it work if I half all the ingredients?
Jimin now has jams, but to be honest this is so yummy..
Oml tysm now i can make jimin some jams
I just left the fandom...
Can’t I watch one jam making vid without bts fans everywhere?
Omg I’m definitely trying this today this looks amazing
I only added 1c sugar and it turned out fine, just took longer to cook. Is that ok or will it go bad?
How much did cost to make strawberry jam and wow homemade jam is good but I prefer less sugar
Im pretty sure jimin looked this up
Thanks sir
*Why am I such a hoe for bts...*
You made this jam just the way I do yummy I only use less sugar
im here to take this jams to jimin
My jam started to harden and is turning into candy, please help
I fucking hate this fandom😂😂 We are so extra😭😭😂😂😂
jimin i think I finally found it
ANY STAYS HERE? -.- XD N WORD
Really
Ive never canned anything, but recently I bought jars about this size only they have no ring.  They have the kind of top that is supposed to lock after the ingredients have been added.  I didn’t use them because all of the canning processes I looked up seemed complicated.  Does anyone know if this type jar works as well as the ones with rings?
Love this....would it be okay to place a lid while on the countertop doe that hour or in the fridge with a lid?
How much sugar is added.
This was so easy- please tell me if there is a simple recipe just like this to make apricot or peach jam? I’d soooo appreciate it.
I have always wanted to make jam, but wasn’t confident enough, as I know it’s not super easy- I just did this recipe...it honestly turned out AMAZING!!! And it was easy! Makes me feel like a competent cook! Thank you so much!!! Can’t wait for breakfast for hot buttered biscuits with my strawberry jam and my family!! 🍓👍🏻 oh and can anyone please tell me if you can  use peaches or maybe apricots to make a preserve this way too? I’d sure appreciate it! :)
I come here because I was watching friends when Monica made jams and it’s make me want to eat it so bad
Can I make this with frozen strawberries??
Of key is the juice of lemon!
okay i really respect and appreciate all of you - but the next time i see the word “army,” i WILL throw my homemade strawberry jam at all of you .
Hi, I really want to try your recipe cos it looks so simple yet delicious. But, can I substitute the sugar with raw honey instead? Thank you!
👍💖💖
This recipe is absolutely fantastic I  Made strawberry jam  came out great the family loves it .. Thank you for a great video.
Simple recipe that comes out with great result! Thank you!
We use this recepie for every fruit jam, just Two things you should remember while making this, one is when the combination Starts comming up during boiling, you might get rid of those White areas, if you dont they will make your final product darker. and the other important thing is when you want use a jar dont forget تو use one that is completely Clean, any drop of water will make the jam have mold and will be unuseable
Great video excellent commentary thanks for a great post!
Guys there are no Korean subs... how is Jimin gonna follow this
Can i use frozen berries if there isn't any sugar added to them?
Can we use any alternatives to white sugar??
*rm u got no jams* rm: *no u* *u dare underestimate jimin* jimin: *🥺😂🥺😂* *punches rm*
Thanks
Thats not a pan thats a pot.
Mmmmm this is a great reverie at first I thought I wouldn’t work be mine was soppy but it turned into yummy jam
Am I he only one confused on the bts army???
I heard if you look at the comments on a how to make jam video you will find ARMY.  I cant believe its true😂
..
Currently maning this with the left over strawberry stuff from the syrup I just made. Fingers crossed it’s delicious
great recipe nothing more needed :)
It worked nicely for me. Quick, easy and delicious. Thanks a lot.
Add a small pat of real butter , never margarine.. and there will be no foam. The butter neutralizes that part.
EXACTLY what I was looking for!  Delicious!  Thank you!
Who would EVER dislike??!!
Wow! Let me cook those strawberries right now. Thanks the guy who is on the screen.i mean it .thanks😄😄
Hi! How long does this last in the fridge when not preserving? 😊
Thank you for making this simple & doable recipe. I was making it the wrong way with still chunks on it. Right amount to share. 🙏
My came out really think is that normal ? Is there any way to thin it out after it’s cold?
Best jam recipe ever🍓🍓
Why the fuck are bts fans here I was expecting goblins
More than half views are from armys
Thank you😍❤️
I have been preparing strawberry jam for 4 times by now, using this amazing recipe. And its really super simple and yummy. Thanks for this vedio :)
can i use this method for any fruit? Like mango, blueberries, grape, kiwi?
can some one suggest if I can use brown sugar instead please and thanks.
Can I use  frozen Strawberries instead of fresh ones because I have quite a lot in the Freezer?
I am going to do jams to jimin :D
I made this jam. It was easy and came out awesome. It's blueberry time now. If I use blueberries, do I still use 2 lbs and then the same process?
Jimin! I got your jam!
Jimin needs this
Jimin doesn’t have any ingredients
*i just came because of life of boris and jimin...*
can I make this with coconut or brown sugar?
Perfect for my strawberry yay yay yay
Jammy lad knows it film gang
I found jimin's jams
How long does this jam stay fresh when stored in refrigerator?
I came here just to see how many Armys would flood this poor person's comment section
2019 Army's here?💀💀
I burst out laughing guys, I'm so done with this fanfom. ARMY FOREVER. I was just trying to prepare a proper jam for my grandma but...... Now I can't, BTS has too much influence on my day. 😂😂Purple you all
Black berry jam, sounds good
Looks really nice I just wanted to know Can you use brown sugar? Thanks.
500% sugar.
I wanna know how to make those biscuits.
Jimin you got no jams xD || Any Armys here?
I literally just came here for the comments, I knew I’d find armys here
lol I feel sorry for u. you have people talking about jimins jams like dude I just wanted some jam with my toast...
What's the point if your putting a bowl ful of sugar in. I make it without
Yummy 😋
"I know people are going to ask this in the comments" The comments: hey Jimin i found yOuR jAmS   Our fandom is a wreck
Jimin you got no jams
LOVE IT SIMPLE AND TASTY,VERY GOOD
Doing this asap! And making toast and opening my last jar of store bought strawberry jam!
Tried this recipe with the strawberries and it was delicious.  If I wanted to do this with seedless grapes, do I need to break the grapes down like in a blender before I cook it or can just add the grapes and rely on the cooking to break it down?
I found your jam jimin
Your recipe is not candy. You use the right amount of sugar. Delicious jam!
This recipe is not candy! It is fresh, fruity and delicious. Using equal parts fruit and sugar makes a thick, sweet jam which is almost candy. The Scandinavians and French use far less sugar than the Americans and Brits.
I'm trying to cut back on added sugar. Can this recipe be used with Stevia instead?!
Where's jiminie 🙃
I want to ask ...why dont u blend it in blendr machine.....I hav frozen 2.5 kg strawberries..........i will made ds 😇😉
Could you  use 1 lid jars? Or does it have to be the ones with the flat lid + the ring you screw into the jar ...?
Amazing. !!! Thank you so much. Going yo get my jars now...
Can you substitute sugar with truvia?
*Now ima make Jimin some jams.*
Thanks!😊
Also, have you ever used Jam marbles? Glass marbles that are placed in the pot to roll around at the bottom and stop the jam from sticking and burning to the bottom?
How easy would it be to multiply this recipe? I like to make jam, marmalade, jelly, chutney etc for friends at Church so would like to know if I can double the recipe.
It also starts splattering all over the stove when it's about done lol
I’d love to make this. It’s just my husband and I at home and we love homemade foods (no everything in a pre filled jar at the store).
Mmm those jams would be perfect for jimin
Save and dehydrate the tops (leaves and all) and use them in hot tea.
"JIMIN YOU GOT NO JAMS"
I’m making this as I type and it’s not foaming at all???
We need to send it to jimin
how long does it keep in fridge
I'm so excited to do this!!
I just want to jump💃 in & have a Strawberry Hot Tub & drink it all🍷... yummy...anyone want to join me? 🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓
I like that this is a small batch too and may even cut it in half. Can't beat homemade strawberry  or raspberry jam!!!  I may even try half a recipe with palm sugar as it is much better for you than white sugar.   Years ago I was making two kinds of jam...strawberry and blackberry. When finished I had enough of both berries for about 1/2 batch each, so I combined the berries and made a whole batch of strawberry-blackberry jam and it turned out to be the BEST jam I had EVER tasted!!!  TY SOOOO MUCH for this recipe...I can't wait to try it!!!  🍓TYFS🍓 P.S. I do have one question: If I mash the berries, would that make much difference...maybe take a little longer to cook down???
Can the sugar be cut, at all? Like 1.5 cups?
👌🏼
Your jam looks so much prettier than the store jam.
WOW that's awesome! 👍👏😋
I just tried this today and it came out amazing 👌🏼
Jam on it!
Can I strain the seeds out pouring through a strainer as I am jarring, will it affect the jam setting up?
Doing this!❤️
Thank you for this!!!
Can we make it without lemon???
I'm definitely going to try this..Thank you so much for this quick and simple tutorial............
Thanks so much for video. I love strawberry jam  actually all jam. Would this work with figs or prunes ?  😃👍🏻
B
I unintentionally made jam lol
Would this work with strawberries rhubarb?
Can u make jimin some
Ymmmm. Does it work with Apricots???? I love my apricots and so miss my grandmas fresh jam 💓
Instructions unclear, used a pan and now my floor is covered in strawberry goop. Did you mean.. pot?
Can I use splenda instead of sugar?
Yum.
Thank you so much
Omg. I have never seen it made so easly. I will be trying this.  Please do show moor stuff. Thank you. I'm new here.
I wanna ask can i replace sugar with brown sugar?
My strawberries have been In the fridge for like 3 hours, I’ll tell you guys how it goes !
Wow very  nice ..I made mix fruit jam.
Jiminn
I just wanted to read comments of people who’ve made this jam and all I got was annoying ass ”aRmY” comments .
Any video relating to jam, even just food jam: exists Annoying homo sapiens: omg army!!! stan bts!!!! jimin has 0 jams!!
This is why I hate BTS 😤🙄😬
Hey Crouton Crackerjacks you didn't boil the jam jars, or did you? Also, did you boil them after to seal?
*jImIn InTeNsIfIeS*
Sugar is pure poison to our systems.
thank you sir for taking your time giving us your secret recipe
Wow thank you! So easy to make!
a Diabetic coma induced recipe here
I have my midterm tomorrow but yet here I am
The photography on this video is really nice. I wonder how many ARMYs have actually learned to make jams now, so we don't have to buy it at the store anymore!
Good job and thank you for sharing 👍❤
I'm so gonna try this very nic!
Thanks 😊 excellent video 👍
Also great video btw. It was really helpful👍
I came here for jam but now I'm confused by bts comments?
Here you go Jimin.....
ah yes,cottagecore
Thank you for this video!  very well explained ! In the winter, when I can't find an abundance of fresh berries, I use frozen and use the same method. Delicious jam without additives etc..
That melon baller hack is genius!
Looks delicious
Can I do this with raspberries too?
*GUYS GUYS I FOUND JIMINS JAMSSSS*
So simple to follow, Thank you. Can I also freeze this, instead of placing into the fridge?
I fucking hate the BTS fandom
Made this today! Thank you so much for the recipe! It was simple, and only required ingredients and utensils that someone would have at home. The jam was DELICIOUS! LOVE FROM CANADA!
Love this recipe I've made it several time this strawberry season
💜 We need show this to Jimin 💜
Excellent recipe!  I will try without Certo this year!  Now I don't have to buy expensive 5 to 6 bags of Certo for making Strawberry Jam, for the whole year.   As well,  "STRAWBERRY JAM  GIFT"  for family and friends - one of the Christmas gifts :)
Thanks i do like your teaching is clear explanation this is what i want small batche of home made jam.    Which i am going to learn how to make it.
can you infuse with red wine?
Why am I here tho!😂😂
Can I process this? How do I process it?
JIMIN HERE IS UR JAMSSS 🍓
Astonishing how much sugar you put in 😱
Excellent video!! I’m going to make it this weekend 🍓
Can you do this with figs? Thanks for sharing
*Jimin.. You got no jams* *~Namjoon*
May I ash how long can it keep, and do I have to put them in the fridge?
am i the only one who puts sugar on my strawberries when i eat them
Can you put less sugar because commercial jams taste like sugar jelly instead of the fruit .
who is jimin army :(
A girl is just tryna look up how to make jam and yall really spreading like fleas
Can I double or triple this recipe? Thanks.
This looks really good.   I am going to make  some today since I have some strawberries in my fridge.   Thanks!
Can i add pectin ?
I have a question that may or may not have been asked before.  Can I use a sugar substitute to make this jam?  I'm a diabetic and still want to have great-tasting jam without all of that sugar.  If so, would Stevia work?  Thanks in advance.
Take notes Jimin.
Genuinely came here to look for how to make jam but was delightfully surprised to see the comments overrun with ARMY.💜
I fucking hate army
Jimin ive found your jams
Thank you for your video! I'm going to try this recipe this weekend! :)
Can I add rhubarb? Can this be processed for longer storage?
Does anyone else watch food videos related to what they are currently eating? I'm eating strawberry pb and J so hear I am
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Nicely done indeed! 😎👍👍
Hi! I just saw your video. I've been wanting to learn how to make jam but not in large batches. I also don't want to buy all the equipment/supplies needed to make jam. This video is all I need on how to make small batches of jam. Thank you for sharing your video. 😊
does it work with banana or melons
RM:Jimin...you got no jams Jimin:I got yes jam **both saw the video**
Can Monkfruit or honey be used instead of sugar?
thank you very helpful, God bless, Jesus loves you
jimin i found your jams
Yum. I spent many of fall making strawberry rhubarb jam. It was quite an operation. You have managed to simplify it, if I added rhubarb would the acidity ruin the jam?
OH, Yummy.
I came for making Jam, why are the BTS army here-
I just shipped this to Jimin so now Jimin’s got 1 jam  1 like= Another Jam for Jimin
Im here to thank you for jimin
Lol I made this then I remembered the army’s always make bad jokes
is there any way to remove the seeds of the strawberries?
How could anyone give this a thumbs down????? So much faster and easier! And who could not eat this yummy jam up before six months is over??? Bring on the biscuits!!!!! Thanks for sharing!!!
me at 7AM: i want strawberry jam so ima make some. Me at 8AM: *checks comments* dammi my jam is ruined
Jimins jam
Will try.....excellent instructions
Looks delicious, wow so simple ! Thank you !
Very Nice 😍
Can yo use frozen berries?
You said "if you're going to use bottled lemon juice...use..." when I think what you meant was "if you're going to use bottled lemon juice, please go away."
Thank you. So nice. Is it ok to use stevia sugar. ?
Very Relaxing to watch thanks
The first item I ever cooked was current jelly. My grandma and I picked the currants, cooked the currants and sugar on a wood stove until it was right, put it is jars then processed the jars in a big pot of boiling water on the same wood stove. A great memory.
Will this work for apricot jam as well?
I’m sorry on behalf of this fandom
Is it shelf stable?
Great recipe and very clearly explained! I am wondering if this jam would work with coconut sugar??
u got no jams
I can't make this until strawberries go on sale but I can't wait. This I know I can do. Great job 👍👍👍👍👍 tfs such an easy recipe that looks amazing
Not sure how I found your video but like it but happy to see can have home jam u might not be able to help but just wondering how would u use rhubarb in this
Can you use Splenda instead of the sugar?
if my jam gets rock hard after putting it in the mason jar and I cannot get it out of the jar for use what did I do wrong? and how can I fix it?
Is it possible to make this sugar free?
*SEND THIS TO JIMIN*
THANK YOU I WILL MAKE SOME...
This looks amazing! I can’t wait to make one! 🥰
can you do the same with grape to make grape jam?
can you do one one peach and pear preserves too?
I love making jam thanx so much defiantly gonna make. Thanx for sharing
Wonderful! Is this scalable?
Thank you,I love strawberry jam..
100% armys are here to get their jam for Jimin
That’s not a biscuit, that’s a scone gosh!
i’m so confused as to why everyone’s talking about stupid bts when they could be watching a good video
Great
Can you use this recipe with peaches? I have made your strawberry recipe and it is perfect!
Do you boil your jars and lids?
I think im the only one here who just wanted to know how to make jam. I read the comments and was genuinely confused. Took me 5 minutes to realize everyone was talking about BTS and I still dont understand the connection between BTS and jam.
people think our ARMY fandom is crazy now, even me as an ARMY thinks it’s true tbh 😭
Dear people I apologize on the behalfe of army for your disturbance  And jimin finally got his jams (billboard)  Thankyou  Saranghe💜
These came out so yummy awesome! So simple yet delicious.
Give it to jimin 😂
I guess im tbe only one on here to know how to make small batch of jam... No jimin.... No army... Lol
You put effort into this video, and thanks for uploading it. Unfortunately this comment section is annoying af because of immature kids.
It's called scalding
Loved your video. Cant wait to try. Maybe set your blocked words to these annoying ones used below so it doesn't happen again.
Can this recipe be used for cake filling?
The comment section is infested with degenerates
The Lemmon juice is totally unnecessary, and it ruin the taste
Just followed your recipe exactly everything came out great it's beautiful thank you
armys share the same brain cells
I found Jimin's jams
Can I substitute the sugar with Stevia or something like that?
I'm done with the bts fandom
Jimin
So, all ARMY do share the same braincell... Oh my...
Can you do this with other fruit?
Jimin Found his jams
Can you use grapes
JIMIN WE HAVE YOUR JAM   edit: if people are getting annoyed by the army just leave the vieo there is no way you came here to make jam just buy some
I don't know what's with the army thing but the jam looks so yummy !!! I'll do it one of these days, thanks !!
Lol I made this with blueberries and it worked out pretty well
Hi, really enjoyed your video, can you tell me the weight of the sugar? 14oz? and what does the pectin do? why would you or would not use it? many thanks
thanks
'' bias jams come through''
i will fucking make this and go to jimins door and leave it there with a note saying '' i had your jams for years and now its hard to let go of it but here bitch''
Chimchim be like *strong power thank you*
Hi, Is there a way to store the jam once packed in normal conditions without using any preservatives?
Still trying to find the jams😔
Jemen You Got No Jems XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Armys making the "jimin you got no jams" jokes are so fucking lame. Its 2019, we have newer and funnier memes and here y'all are hanging on to the unfunny old ones... LET IT GO, Y'ALL ARENT FUNNY JUST CRINGE
ight whats jimins number
Thank you for this it really helped me and I just made it, I got burnt a couple times but it was definitely worth it for the result
What shoud be the temperature to preserve it?
Fck k pop
Omg WHO is Jimin?  WTF did his Jam go, did this ARMY take it? Who's Army? What's happening here lol... no, seriously, wtf
Brill
I'm here!
I came here for the jam and I wasn’t expecting to see so many armys
For those of you actually trying to make strawberry jam: this recipe turned out amazingly for me and I highly suggest it 👌 10/10
How do you open it ?🤣🤣
What’s going on in the comments I’m confused
I can’t believe I’m here
I found jimins jams!!!!!!!!!!!! CALL JIMIN N TAE
I actually came here for a project but hey I'm an army too lmao
This comment section is leJINdary
Hi I was looking for a simple strawberry jam and chanced upon your channel!  What a great find thank you.  I tried your recipe and it worked!  Thank you and look forward to more as a new sub!
Im buying some of jimins jams v.v
I came for the recipe, idgaf about BTS and annoying army. Just stop, its not funny, its annoying.
Yum...Strawberry and rhubarb. 😊
AHA haha
60% of these comments are going to be about Jimin's Jams.
can i used frozen strawberries?
So perfect...Thanks for you
☕☕
Can I use brown sugar??
What the fuck is jimins jam in all the videos of jam I've seen? Someone explain this shit to me
Thank you i am just going to make it 🇨🇦
2.. = how many kilograms ?
I couldn't have imagined that it could be that simple. Nice and helpful video :)
If i store in frig..does that mean i cant mail any to my mom bc of havinh to be refrigerated?
Where is the salt?
You got no jams
normal people who just want to make jam: wth is going on   armys:jimin I FoUnD yOuR jAmS
Can I use brown sugar??
I am sending this video to Jimin💜💜
Or do you put in the fridge?
Do you keep the strawberries on the counter?
2:02 I think I would stop right there just to eat all of that 😍😍😍
That's a lot of sugar...
This poor dude probably has no idea who jimin is XD I’m so done with my fandom. And why does jimin need so much jam ☠️
When I want  berry jam, I just cook a bag of frozen berries with either sugar or stevia and a little water. Cook for about 10 to 12 minutes and you've got jam for a week, kept in the fridge. Easy
"How to make Jams"
I didn't come for bts but I am an army
Jimin you should make some jams
. .. Jimin you got no jams
Glad I clicked this vid second, the first vid required tools and extra steps - your vid didn’t!  So looking forward to trying this recipe! I have a surplus of strawberries and do not want them to go to waste!
1:50 diabetes entered the chat
Do I have to buy Concord grapes to make Grape jam?
I came to find Jimins jams😂😂😂😂
People and their fandoms. Can't even watch how to make jam with comments on some fandom. Chilllllll
Thank you
I'm not here for the fandom. I actually made this and I want to thank the person who showed me how. Thank you. It came out great!
Lol is there anyone here who clicked this video to see an actual jam recipe and not to make a Jimin and his jams joke?
Wow. I can't wait to make it.
This video is my jam.
Could I use this recipe for peaches or pineapple?
Wow this is really easy want to try and I will,  one question: do I have to boil it when I jarred it??  I saw another jam without pectin and they put it in a pot after the jar was done and sealed
Nice editing bro.
Omg! Thanks for the easy recipe !! I can't wait to try it.
Beautiful!! I've got to try this! Thanks for sharing.
Oh there's jimins jam
Perfect ❤❤❤
*_that's too much suga on my jams........BUT I DONT MIND._*
Absolutely amazing!!
I’m here to make jimin some jams
If I make a Jam recipe it’s only going to be only for Army commenters. Because I can’t stand hate towards them so if any Army’s want to comment about Jimin’s Jams on my video Go for it. This is a free comment section you can comment whatever you want. I seriously can’t handle hate towards the boys.
Here's our Imins Jams.     It' reason why Jimin got no Jams
Love it 😍 I
Wow delicious 🍓🍓🍓🍓
thanks this is very good
I made it with strawberries and blueberries, turned out amazing 👍🏻 Am Definitely going to make this again and share it with my family ...Thanks a million for sharing
*_Jimin wants to know your location_*
*Jimin you got no jams*  >:3333333333333333333

Does this work for frozen strawberries?
What would happen if I don't use lemon juice?
Thanks helped a lot!

I never knew it could b so easy....thanks a lot sir I m sure gonna try this
I came here bc i was genuinely searching for strawberry recipes, why is the comment section full of ARMYs???? W h a t h a ppened
I'm here to make Jimin some jams
hnmm...interesting..so if u want a good jam with not a huge bunch of chunky pieces, best to dice it up small eh?   question...what if u have an unspecified amount, say small to medium sized ziploc bag..of fruit...any kind..and u want to make jam that way.  can u do that?  i dont see how u cant reduce the sugar tho.   i would think for every cup or so of fruit, thats how much sugar u use right?  but so far as the process goes, thats all there is to it?   u just mix the cut up fruit and sugar, and then boil it all for about 20 mins?   any other helpful hints would be greatly appreciated TY.  like a guide on how to make ANY kind of jam an not screw it up lol
Jimin this is a gift for you you found your jam now
Jimin needs some jams so I'm making him some
Yummmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I can’t wait!! Thx for the video!!!
Wove du vid 🎀💓💓💓🎀
That is an insane amount of sugar. It was enough to turn me of.
Thank you so much! That's really satisfying. I will try it😉
The sugar turned me off. Too much.Thank you, Next!
Chaeyong brought me here
CHIM CHIM GET YA ASS OVER HERE WE FOUND YOUR JAMS MY DUDE

brilliant, thanks for sharing....
This recipe looks so easy! Thank you...Imma try it :)
All the ARMYs freakin spamming the comments
OK now I have a jar of jam to give to jimin 🤣🤣🤣
You just got yourself a new subscriber!! I really love this video and how simplified it is compared to other recipes I’ve seen. One question though: Our strawberries here are quite pale right now, so I’m wondering if I could still use them or if I should try frozen strawberries?
This comment section makes me wanna commit deathpacito. I WATCH THIS VIDEO TO MAKE A FRENCH TOAST FOR GRANDMA NOT FOR JIMIN JAMS SHIT.
Can I use agave instead or sugar or some other healthier substance?
Jimin you got Jams. XD
Super tasty
Can you explain processing?
I have started making homemade bread. After loads of experiments I have started making decent edible bread. There is a setting for jam in it, After the one hour on counter, can I put it in the bread machine to finish off?
Awesome strawberry jam thanx sir for video
u understand u don't have a life when u're here just for jimin... jimin, I found your jam.
There's no fandom existing like this one
Jimin you got no jams
Could you do this by using honey instead of sugar
Jimin... YoU GoT No jAmS.
Why is everyone talking about *Jimin's Jams?*
Jimin needs to watch this video
comment section be like : 0,1% Grandmas 99,9% armys
I'm army but I just wanted to make jam ;-; and not for Jimin- wHy iS JiminS jAmSs hEre
I heard if you put in a touch of butter it reduces foaming...thoughts?
Can I use a sugar substitute.  Looks delicious but need sugar free.
give jimin some jams
IU~Jam Jam
Wow thanks for the recipe :3
Thank you very much gonna make this for my BF.....and myself
Hello Mr. I was wondering if you were up to making jams for my dear friend Park Jimin. He lost his jams and is looking for some more. If you made home some I’d be very pleased and he would be too. THANKS
Can I use brown sugar better? Thank you
can we substitute brown sugar with this?
Jimin should watch this 😂😂😂😂
So, Jimin can say to RM that he got jams
Maybe jimin could learn from this.
Very good Sir. Thank you. But don't you need adding some water to it. As I see it will solidify once cold.
RM needs to show this to Jimin XD
Can this be made with frozen strawberries?
Ate a pb&J through ths lol!  Went to whole foods and bought organic pb and the strawberry jam. But man oh man yours looks greaaaaat
Waiting for my strawberries to macerate now.
what's the use of lemon? its for what??
I love this fandom so much
*WE FREAKING NEED TO SHOW THIS TO JIMIN SO HE CAN MAKE HIS JAMS...AND HE WILL HAVE JAMS AGAIN!*
Im assuming this same recipe can be multiplied and made in larger batches
*army intensifies*
hello, can i add less sugar?
Hi! Is this an example of fermentation?
っ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)っ𝕙𝕆𝕡𝔼 𝕥𝕙𝕀𝕤 𝕙𝔼𝕝𝕡𝕊 𝕛𝕚𝕄𝕚𝕟
these comments are so ugly
For jimin huhu
Sound really THICCCQ
Thanks so much for making this video!
do I have to use lemon?
Holy lord i came here for babushka comments
HAHHAHAHAHA       no
This is why some ppl just don't like kpop
Jimin you got no jams!
Stop armys its disrespectful...
WHO OR WHAT IS ARMY
Yum!!! Can't wait to make this
*namjoon is this for jimin*
This one is infested with army's too, darn.
*i knew i would find army's here*
I really hate this fandom
Question:  once in jar will the heat seal this [if u boil lids]  keep on shelf until it's opened? Thinking of gifts.
Jimin... You got yes jams
All the comments are about bts 😂.
Omg I came here to check if the think about army in jam videos is true. I still can't belive it is😂😂😂 only army would be this extra
Can you substitute raw honey instead of cane sugar,if so how much honey?
These comments make me want to die
I don’t like jam  I wish that i ate a lot as a kid so i can eat it now with no problem but I can’t we have a lot of jams and I think it’s good quick thing to make but I don’t like it i hate the texture and the sweetness i don’t like fruit with anything than eating them alone i don’t like cheese cake with jam or fruit cake or any dessert  that contains fruit I want to change that  It’s really important to me
Thank you for making a strawberry jams now I know how to make a strawberry jams thanks for teach us...
Thank you so much💖 I subbed after watching this video😍 my 12 yr old son asked if we could make homemade jam together, which I have never done, and was looking for simple recipe, glad I found this video! Thanks again💖💖💖
Why do other recipes ask for cornstarch???
Hi can i use lime juice instead of 🍋
I came to to make some jams for Jimin
Could I use a metal teaspoon instead of the melon baller?
excuse my fandom
Do you add water to the jam and if so how much?
You think I can make this jam with frozen berries?
How long can we keep this?
what am i doing with my life tho lol i ship jimin with jams jamin
add suga to jimin jams i swear if there is a jam brand called jimin i would laugh so hard
best jam recipe: babuskash jam from life of boris.
It worked very very well with my long forgotten strawberries in the freezer. Thanks a million for sharing!! I love iiiittt!!!
I feel like I'm the only one who came here because I want to make jam
What about peaches?
Good Work i like this
who the fuck is jimin? stfu
Does this method work for other fruit?
Hi ARMY’s
who's here for joey tribbiani ? :)
is it bad if i dont add any sugar i just want to make it as healthy as possible but i dont really like raw strawberry
Wow..i love strawberries so much😛😛
A'ight, people are finding a comment without the bts thing so here ya' go
Jimin, now you got jams...
Thank you so much for the recipe. My jam is delicious thanks to you 😘💕!! You gained a follower 🤗!!
how those fruits become juicy after mixed with sugar? Should I put them in the refrigrator?
Thank you! Your jam looks perfectly Delicious😋
Absolutely love this recipe
Who else is here just cause they want to make jam and not because of BTS? Just me? Ok...
I made this, and rubbed it on my Mrs boobs, then licked it off. My Mrs was happy and I got a great taste in my mouth. Highly recommend this recipe 👍
Fun fact strawberry despite its name is not a berry because its seed are inside and a that a banana is actually a berry
I'm here to make Jimin some jams
I'm looking for jimins jams
Im here to find my Jams
If you put a bit of oil in the cold fruit-sugar mixture, the jam will not foam as much. usually you should scoop out the foam because air bubbles inside the jam will reduce its shelf life :-)
can I use brown sugar or sweetener instead of white sugar??
Finally, Jimin can have Jams😏
im so sorry im here for jimin bc he needs this and RM needs to share the recipe bc i probably have no jams either but that jam looks so good
still no jams
wooow i cant believe im part of this fandom....... XD
If you wanted to process this using a canner is that possible? Or would it over cook?
nice
Who else looked this up JUST to see if ARMYs REALLY commented bout "jimin and his lost  jams"
Hey mister Crouton Crackerjack, I think youre gonna be a cool friend to be with
Skl im an army but i honestly just searched for "strawberry" coz i need food aesthetic then this was the first video about strawberry food then im supposed to ignore but i got the feeling like it's gonna be fun so, i clicked, and now what can i say i guess it's destiny   Ps. Whoo what a long narrative😅
Thanks for the inspiration. I just made mine today. It was super easy and super delicious. Yum yum..
Will It work with a Sweetner
Just love how easy this recipe is to follow thanks to the video (: Thanks for teaching us what could go wrong. Can't wait to make this.

I love strawberry jalapeno jam. At what stage should I toss in the peppers? Just curious. Excellent video...thank you!
Yikes this comment section is hard to read. I remember my cirngey jimin you got no jams phase 😔
Have I finally found Jimin's jams?
( ‾ ʖ̫ ‾) This fandom tho..
Jimin you got know jams
I'm so sorry my dude. You just wanted a family friendly,  calm, not that popular making jam video. But you know what you got? A WHOLE BLEEP OF ARMYS TAKING OVER THE WORLD. SO. IM DEEPLY SORRY. but at least you got views
How long would they last if canned?
excuse me but who is jimin? :/
Love The melon Baller idea🙂.   How much does a cup of sugars weigh.  Sorry I don’t work in cups
Jimin got no jams
Jimin i have found your Jams! XD
Does it need to have so much sugar? Is there an alternative I can use to cut back on the sugar?
I love all your recipes, so simple
We need to show jimin this vid lol
Can u do this will any berries or fruit
I SWEAR i see me ARMYS everywhere!
Made mine last night and this recipe is so easy and delicious!!!!
So much damn sugar

Jiminie needs to watch this video so he'll gain some 'jams'😂
So like good RECIPE... WHERE IS MY JIMIN JAMS???
I'm sure that many people are curious about who is Jimin and why people finding his Jams
Jimin got yes jam right?
Jimin we found them
Do I have to use white granulated sugar ??  Can I use organic cane sugar ??
Can I make this recipe with coconut sugar instead?
Used this recipe to make jam out of 3.5 pounds of strawberry. The jam came out well and the texture of jam is great. However, it is too sweet for my liking.  Otherwise this is a great recipe.
REALLY good video👍
I am going to make this! thanks for this video :)
My jam ended very hard and sticky.  I don't know what I did wrong??
Lovely I'm going made this tomorrow
any PTAWTMJNJAJs? (people that actually wanted to make jam not just a "joke")
Hate the gummy texture of pectin so this recipe is perfect.  Looks delicious !
Those muffins / biscuiuts / scones / whatever look absolutely delicious. Did you make those yourself and if so, please, I would love to have that recipe. Great video.
I tried this with stevia and erythritol and it worked perfectly!
I know I watched this a year ago but I know someone will watch this at this month or year but  How many hours or minutes is the over all cooking plz I need this for our school cooking preservation our teacher said atleast an hour plz answer
Armies need to chill out!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡
Wait, I FOUND JIMIN’S JAMS. HALLELUJAH WE FOUND IT, NOW JIMINIE OPPA CAN BE HAPPY AGAIN~
I won’t say anything about jimins jams (oh wait I just did) and on behalf of some of the army we are sorry
I knew ARMYs are here
Army's yes. the joke " Jimin got no jam's " is funny. used to be. This person actually made the video to make " jam's " " Strawberry jam " not " Jimin Jam's " ( The joke is actually quite dead. probably some new army's that discovered bangtan bomb uses it ) i seriously stan bangtan like i stan other's but, stop it. the video was not made for you to comment about a " guy who was told by their leader that they had no jam's for a joke " k bye respect that you actually found my comment and read it. good for you if you realize that commenting thing's that doesn't even have anything related with it is not that cool.  k bye seriously please at least take some consideration to do it. ( nO hATe <3 )  *I'm usually saying this to every fandom but since mic drop/dna dropped and got bomb alot of new fan's are going to bts, so army's are getting everywhere. ik every fandom has this but since bts is currently rly big the annoying one's are getting rly big. not hating just an advice so you don't get yelled at and to being more mature here. <3*
umm am I the only one here because I want to make strawberry jam..cuz all I see is this bts thing people keep talking about
I LITTERALY CAME HERE TO FIND ARMIES.  I KNOW.I HAVE NO LIFE😂
This is my jam.
Type of comments 95% ask for a recipe for Jimin's jams  5%  is from normal people who want to make just a f*cking jam    Have a nice day/night 😊💕
I found some jams for you Jimin
How would you use frozen mixed  berries? Thank you.
This is great!! Thank you for sharing!
OMG We ARMYS are very sorry for flooding your comments! Were just here so we can make some and give some to Jimin!
Yes I am and ARMY but I came here for your jam thank you for the recipe lol
*looks at the comments* if you're feeling suicidal you've come to the right place.
nice
Everything looked good except that sugar part
UM DID YOU KNOW    Read More
So much sugar
Why u need the lime juice?
I made them, there were great. They remained me of my grandmother jelly. Thank you.
☺☺☺
jimin i didn't know you had a 1% jam power level
So if I wanted to use blueberries is it still 2lb worth? Does the amount of fruit used change with each fruit?
That's not jam.  That is a strawberry sauce akin to what you would put on a cake.
Will this work for jimin?
Thank you illustrated it very well I will try it 👍🏻
Will this recipe work using Splenda?
JIMIN’S JAMS
My mom left the sugar mixture out overnight .. is it still okay to use and make jam?
Can you can the jam so that it can store without being refrigerated?
I used three pounds of berries and four cups of sugar to make 4 1/2 pint jars. Then I processed mine in a water bath for ten minutes so it will be shelf stable.
This was exactly what I was hoping to find! I'm going to bake a Victoria sandwich and this will be perfect between the layers.
What's wrong with our fandom
Like the way, he did that. Easy-peasy.
Missing  Jimin jams 1 year later Found Jimins jams
Looking by the comment section.. I can't ever get away from this fandom.. now let me comment something normal  I love how this recipe doesn't need pectin or gelatin (Agar agar works too! It's just like gelatin but vegan/seaweed based)
Ah, thank you my boyfriend Jimin will love this, cuz his jaMleSs ass needs it
Awesome! I will teach my grandchildren this strawberry jam recipe. Together we will enjoy chemical free healthy strawberry jam. Thanks. God bless.
I love this simple, easy and yet delicious recipe (without pectin) for jam.  Thank you !
Every time with these Americans I have to search for what on earth a "pound" and a "cup" is in standard units
Thank you!!!
So smart of you... Melon ballers.. Thats kinda great idea. Rather chopping... 🙄 oh yes and thank you for this simple mimple recipe.. Loved it. ♥ great for a lazy like me. Phewwww....😧
Hi, I watched yesterday and made 3 batches of PERFECT strawberry jam, I am so please and just want to say thank you!
The boiling water is to sterilize the jars. You should also yurn them around after putting the lid on. They will preserve longer
Pectin isn’t a poison or weird chemical.  It comes from the quince fruit tree brought here to the US by the Spaniards.
Thank you for this vedio dear,very simple and you explain it very clearly and without using any special tools...thousand of Thumbs - up to you...i tried your method....super super easy and delicious...i simply love it to spread in my breakfast toast.
jimin deserves his jams
Can I use frozen raspberries?
*sniff* *sniff*   I smell ARMYs
could you use this process and substitute another fruit, maybe banna?
Made this today it looks, smells and test good.👍🏻✌🏻🇺🇸
Could you just leave the sugar out and still make the jam would you be able to give me a recipe for sugar free Jam
Jimins JAMSSS
can you also store it in the freezer?
Jimin still has no jams. After all these jam vids he still has no jams.... help JIMIN.... the jamless boy
how long will this last???
jimin, you got not jams
Now I know how to make strawberry jam I like that you didn't add any pectin it's not good for you  that's a good and perfect consistency jam
i need a recipe for Jams for jimin? send me help please.
Do u have a recipe, on homemade coconut cake?
Looks so good
Can you use honey instead of sugar?
Could I process this in my canner to have it last longer
Jimin I'm bringing you yo jams     In ya face namjoon
99% percent of these comments are about jimin
Will this consistency hold up well as a cake filling?
I hope Jimin sees this
Will this work for other fruits, like oranges and pineapples?
I need a recipe for jimin jams RM:jimin you got no jams

Im sorry on behalf of my fandom
Who is this jimin btw? Saw so many jimin lol
Jimin need this     Jimin got no jams
I am so so sorry and I apologise on behalf of my fandom that I love.
But  we all want to know is this a real recipe  for Jimins Jams ?
Great video! Thank you! Does it have to be white sugar? Can it be like raw sugar, coconut sugar, or even honey or maple syrup? Thanks! 💙💙💙
Love it!!
How long can a homemade jam last?
Can I use raw brown sugar?
As usual another awesome recipe. I'm going to try this in June our strawberry season can't wait!. Looks delicious. Yum!!.
Jimin get your jams back and slap them into namjoons face and say "WHO GOT JAMS NOW???!!!"
I made this his way, and it is just like he said the recipe would be
Jimin you got no jams
Don't lie  Your an Army aren't you.
GUYS WE HAVE FOUND JIMIN'S JAMS. I REPEAT. WE HAVE FOUND JIMIN'S JAMS.
Jimin needs this🍴
jimin u got no jams
I found your jams, Jimin
Jimin you got no jams
This is my jam !!
I tried your recipe it was very delicious thank you
Awsome ...yummi ....easy ...
Can you double this? Or do half the recipe?
Love your video .. i want to try that. May i ask: ... you mentioned using 1 table spoon of lemon but i see that you squeeze half a lemon into the strawberry. If half a lemon = 1 table spoon? Will it be possible if i do not add lemon - will the taste be any different? .....Thanks!
Please lose the music.... you don’t need it!  Great recipe!
Awesome
Who came here for jiminie XD
Someone needs to send this to Jimin🤣
Hi man! Im from indonesia,and you really leveled up my cooking skill. Thanks! Love from Indonesia!
Thank you for sharing.  I like to cook and have made custards and fudge but never homemade jam.  My kitchen is small and cabinet space is scarce, so I don't really have the room for all the usual canning equipment, I like that this doesn't need any equipment or pectin and it looks good.  I would have to try it on some vanilla ice cream with some shortcake bread.
THANKS
Lovely
Thank YOU sooo much for sharing this great video...
Handsome
Is this recipe freezer safe? Also do you have a recipe for the biscuits in this video?
.... Wonderful!! 💕
Drizzle that gorgeous-ness over your beautiful Angel Food cake!  Bliss!
Could you make Jams for Jimin please?  Namjoon Fruit is best.
how much sugar do you use? Very informative and I am very interested in doing this.
nice one
1 like = 1 jam for Jimin
Doctor! We figured out how to cure Jimin, HE NEEDS JAMS

can army stop making comments about jimin it’s hella rude and annoying. Stop being a disgrace to bts and the creator of this video. You’re also making army look bad. We already have a bad reputation.
Jimin you got no jams.  Any armys here 😏😂😂
Great video thanks
Is there any way i can make this without sugar? I have diabetes and love jelly but i think i can handle the natural sugar but not all that extra sugar. Thanks in advance
Wow, looks so good and easy! Thanks for a great video!
It's too sweet. Could we reduced the sugar and change it to something else?
lets save jimin
I love strawberry jam. It's absolutely amazing!!!!!
Jimin might need this video. 😂
what's the shelf life of this recipe?
Jimin u only need 3 ingredients to have jams 😂😂
I apologise for the behalf of my fandom
Jimin
we are following :3 kawaii face
Thank you for this. Each time I make strawberry jam, I'm forced to share it with many people. Time to be selfish and have just for myself :)
jimin needs this recipe lmao
is a small batch enough for jimin?
Please excuse my fandom, but we just wanted to let you know that our precious jimin is certainly going to find your video helpful
babushkas jam blin :D stay cheeki breeki :D
Any ARMY out there? We Finally Found Jimin's Jams  Mission Accomplished Jimin Needs To Watch This Not The Official Recipe  Is There A Official Recipe for Jimin's Jams
I was wondering why you needed to macerated the strawberries but I realized you did it so you didn’t have to add water while cooking the jam.
Hi, I was just wondering if brown sugar would be alright?
If you don't wanna use sugar, use frozen berries. :)
Here to get jimin some jams
Thanks, I like this recipe its simple and looks yummy ...
JIMIN COME HERE PLEASE YOU NEED TO SEE THIS
On behalf of army’s we are sorry for the spamming lol, jimin did find his jams thx to u, have a nice day
Great video, if I don't want it as thick, what do I need to do to the mix, I'm traying to make jam sauce like Starbucks uses for their Strawberry and yogurt Frappuccino, thanks
thank you
I read every comment to find out if any one has shared personal experience making this recipe, sadly all the comments that I had read are about jimin
I made this and it came out delicious! Taste exactly like the store version but without all the chemicals. The only thing is after i put it in the fridge it harden up a lot. Very unspreadable, it goes back to a good consistency when I warm it up. Do I have to keep warming it up before I use it?
You got no jams
Love your recipe 😪 made one just today 😬Instead of regular sugar I used coco sugar (for a healthier version). Thanks and love this video 👍
That's my jam
I wonder if Jimin likes strawberry jam....
tried this recipe for my mom, overall she likes the recipe. She doesn't like pectin (so do I, the texture of pectin makes me wanna puke) that I need to search up different jam recipes, and this one worked for me.  and sorry for the flood of jimin comments here, every jam making video has a sea of jimin related comments coz he has no jams lmao
LML everyone is like "fuck the jam we are her for him!!"
Can you make this with no added sugar ?
I really wish I had some jams.
My jam related video is full of A.R.M.H like me the Jimin needs this
Any Jams is good right Jimin
Y’all know why I’m here
Just made them according to your recipe. They are super yummy and the color is so vivid with the right consistency. Thumbs up!
Geee i notice that almost everyone talk about jimin in this video and you know what....... That's so meannnnn, you guys should come here because you want to learn, not because of him... Oh by the way of course i know jimin but i'm not a fan because i don't want to be beside him on the day of judgement😶
Who's Jimin?
I live under a rock. ..who the fuck is jimin?
JESUS HOW MANY JAM VIDEOS HAVE THE ARMYS INVADED 😂😂😂😂😂
Goddamn Army  I wanted to watch a jam video so I can make guava jam but no, y'all reminding me that Jimin got no jams and it's making me sad
“There’s no special tools no special equipment”  *uses a some sort of tool to remove strawberry leaf”   SMHHHHHHH
can you triple this recipe??
Hi can î use frozen berries??
thank you
does this work with raw sugar instead of normal granulated sugar?
Tried it and this came out delicious.
Jimin were you at boy
This motherfucking comment section.
Who/What the fuck is BTS? I'm guessing it's some Koreaboo cancer shit that has, like anime, influenced foreigners to become a shit fandom, and annoy the shit out of people in comment sections on YouTube, Reddit, etc. by making every goddamn thing to ever exist a shitty reference to their shit fandom. ...Shit.
I'm here to make jimin some jam
why do we need to use hot bottles??
Can I request you to make some jams and send it to Jimin? Make sure to add some extra Suga, pls
Yay! Thank you! :)
I'm just looking through the comment sections lol what a fandom
it did not worked for me. instead of doing strawberry jam i finished uo doing a strawberry brownish caramel. i waited for the "jam" to loose heat or get cold and it is hard. it looks like a big strawberry brownish caramel lolly pop. it doesnt looks anything close to a jam
Omg, all natural ingredients. I can't wait to try this, thank you! 😉
Army everywhere. Even on a jam video. Feeling so embarrassed right now.
I am now well informed on how to make jam with your tips and tricks.  This is an excellent video for the novice jam maker.   Thank you  Crouton Crackerjacks
I only have a pound of strawberries so do i fold every ingrediant in half too?
Dear crouton crackerjacks,          I'm sorry for behalf of this fandom
the armys are l i v i n g
All of jam Recipes have army comments   But no complaining cause im one
Just finding jimin some jams
Instead of immediately adding to jars, what would happen if I let it to sit and cool in the pan ? Please help.  Currently in the process of cooking the jam. Great video by the way! It smells great already!
I wonder what kind of  jam Jimin likes🤔
Clear and precise instructions.  Thank you so much.  Looks delicious.
Jimin needs this jam
Jimin?
I KNEW MY ARMY WOULD BE HERE!
me: *ok im going to watch these videos and just see how many jimin comments there are* me *frik what is their adress i stg im going to send fanmail me *intense music intensifies* Bts: *gets fainmail* Bts Namjoon: Jimin, this one is for you! Bts Jimin: *opens the mail* Mail: *HAAAYAYYYY JIMINIE I MADE SOMMEE JAAAAM YAAA??????  TELL RAPMONSTER THAT U GOT JAM AND THAT IT TOOK LOT OF SWEAT OF MINE FROM THE RESEARCH* me: *receives a call* Unknown international caller: *Plan your funeral how dare you give him ... jams*
I am glad I am not an ignorant kid no more...lol.Thanks for the video
Can armys stop with all these comments I like BTS but it's hella disrespectful to the actual creator of the video every time you guys spam non BTS related videos with comments like this...
THANK YOU for a small batch recipe. You are correct, other recipes call for 6 to 8 pints worth of jam...who eats that much jam? I am going to make this!!!
One tip for people who make food videos       Don't make how to make jam videos or else ARMYs will flood your video with comments saying  "Jimin got jams now"and suga kookies and tae
*I'm so done with this fandom...*
Can I use Stevia powder or F.O.S. (Fructose Oligo Saccharide) in place of Sugar?  I am diabetic.  Also, will this recipe work with tropical non-bery fruits available in my country (India), like Guava, Mango, Star-Apple, Jack-Fruit, Litchi, etc?
IM SORRY     Read my name
I'm just checking all the how to make jam videos for army's. And every single one has army's.
jimin where u at?
made my first batch taste amazing and way better than the store brought Brand's thanks a million
can armys please stop commenting about the jam thing? honestly, it's quite annoying that a simple recipe video can't even be saved from you guys. it's old as hell and frankly, we're all tired of it.
Really, this is not even related to Kpop! Fuck, you guys need to chill!
Can you make a special video making jams for Jimin? That would be great. He have been searching for jams his whole life... thanks!
bts army oh my kat jimins jams
excuse me~~~~ can u give me the recipe to jimin's jams cos i want to make him some :)
thank you soo soo much for this recipe.. I just made the jam and it's better then any store bought brand I have had..just wanted to know that if I wanna make a bigger batch of jam what would b the ratio of sugar and strawberries?   thanks again...;-) =D> >:D<
thanks u so much this really helped me today.
I actually came here to make Jam for Dinner, but ya'll armys are just getting to me lol. My boy Jimin this Jam is for you.
i just made it and it taste sooooooooo good
Making it right now so I can use it for my New York style mini cheesecake bites.
Exact ratio please.

Hope Jimin has ingredients
I came here to make Jimin some jams
Thank You for making this video! Jimin really needs some jams so now I get to make him some! DON'T WORRY JAMLESS JIMIN YOU WILL GET YOUR JAMS!!
I learned some good tips and look forward to trying his way.
Jimin?
Next... Marmalade, please :)
come on. I seriously came here only for the knowledge to make jam, but the comments keep on flooding about Jiimin, I can't help but scream "jimin you got no jams"
he got jams 😁😁
What is the strawberry jam good with?
you got no jams
that moment when you literally look up strawberry jam just to comment on them :') dood jimin needs your jams more than you he may have hella jams in bed but hes got no jams on stage ..
u got no jam
iTs bad that I'm heRe to FinD jiImiNs JaMs and I watched EntIre vidEo WITHOUT THE JAMS
Can you use a heat diffuser under the pot to keep the strawberries from sticking?
Can you make Jimins jams???
So easy and delicious!
Thanks very much I am making this jam right now :)
Jimin this is a perfect video for you. make sure namjoon don't steal your jams  again.
can I double this recipe or triple??
Always always spoon it out first and never leave crumbs in it. It'll go mouldy very fast. A tip my grandma stresses me to remember
Made this a few days ago, it's amazing. Had it with a fried egg sandwich on a ciabatta roll, never buying jam again!
Awesome!! Can you also suggest me what I can use instead of sugar and can I use vinegar or Orange juice instead of lemon juice?
This is such a perfect recipe for when I attempt to make my scones and clotted cream!! I'm sure using fresh fruit is always best, but can frozen be used as well??? Also, what do you mean by process??
lmao i'm here for jimin i'm so sorry i have no life
can i use this method with other fruits ??
smh
any A.R.M.Y here. please answer
any A.R.M.Y here. please answer
JIMIN WE FOUND YOUR JAMS!!!!!!!!
making strawberry jam for the first time today. this video really helped
You Got No Jams :v
For how long can this be stored outside refrigerators?
i cant believe im here
I checked a lot of jam vids and there a lot of BTS Fans here
I honestly came here for bts but honestly that jam looks good and now I'm starving
Can you use grapes for the jam
jimin needs this
Yey Jimin can have his jams back😂🎉
I might try frozen fruit.  Since they're picked later should be more flavorful.
I love that this is a small batch and no special tools or weird ingredients THANK YOU!
jimin i found your jams
Is there a recipe for Jimin's jams?
idk what i'm doing but i'm in a jam frenzy--just decided that ma boi jimin deserves love
Hello, I was wondering would I make this and store in the refrigerator for a week would I be able to bring with me on the plane and not be refrigerated for at least 24 hours?
im going to give this video to jimin, he needs it LOL
Your recipe ROCK!  Thank you so much for sharing
who's here checking comments for armys      EDIT: *SOOOOOOO MANY LIKES*
I stopped at 2:33 and just started spooning them over ice cream. Strawberry jam FAIL on my part. Will try again another time.
will this method work to make blueberry jam?
The buttermilk biscuit looks good with the jam.
I am so making this. can I use regular cleaned out jars instead of the canning jars? tfs
you're my hero
how long t can be stored
Thank you so much for this recipe!! I have been searching for a simple jam recipe that didn't use a bunch of other ingredients so I'm so excited that I found this!! ❤️
I love your carefully selected recipes and process/technique to make things to satisfy the taste buds!!!  Fantastic quality of ingredients too. What more can I say... I must sample them.
My mouth is watering.  Strawberry jam is my favorite :-)
Thanks for the awesome recipe! I've used 1 1/2 cup of caster sugar instead of granulated sugar and it tasted so good!
Thank you for this!! I've been wanting to make my own jams but I haven't even looked up how to make one yet. This is amazing.
haaay I made your Chinese fried rice and egg rolls tasted great!
That's beautiful jam!  I haven't made jam in a couple years.
this was a great strawberry jam recipe!
Jason, you make everything look so easy. I will need to try this recipe for sure.
Oh that looks so yummy..I love strawberry jam.  I think I'm going to make this as soon as the strawberries are available for picking locally. Thanks!!
its easy to follow yr recipe unfortunately strawberries are sooooo expensive here in east malaysia...luv yr recipes though
Definitely deserves the thumbs up i can't wait to make this
Beautiful video! Easy to follow instruction. Even though I am diabetic I am going to make a batch for my family.
glad you're posting again, these videos are awesome!
Can you use fresh berries that have been frozen?
Would this work with less sugar? I love all your videos btw.. ❤ thanks so much
woooow que ricooooo 😍😍😍
omg that looks straight forward and I love the simplicity. I hadn't click the notification bell so no wonder I nearly missed this gem.
I like that he didn't use any pectin. I hate that texure of pectin.
Awesome! I liked the idea of using the melon baller to "cut" the strawberries. Thanks so much for sharing this idea!!
Also in the process you can also use 2 pounds of peaches canned or fresh!
Question can you use a mixer when you boil strawberries to break it down.
love jam on buttered toast 😋
that looks amazing! I have to make this for my grandpa one day
I'm going to give this a try
Will this work with fruits that are not berries?
If you put the strawberries in the food processor would it be too much liquid. Or will the strawberries break down
I added this channel because I'm interested in making everything fresh. I don't want to associate myself with these cancer affiliated products...
This is wonderful! Thank you so much a Jason I love the consistency of the jam.
can we use splenda instead of sugar?
