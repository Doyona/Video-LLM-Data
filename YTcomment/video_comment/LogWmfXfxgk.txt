Obviously don't just use a standard vacuum cleaner as the water sucked up will destroy it. You need a special vacuum which is made to suck up water.It's called a Wetvac in the UK.
I have none of those things. It will not be zero dollars.
What's the Name of this blue one bottle
Wow
I was looking into possibly removing the car seats in order to clean them.  But with your method it won't be necessary.  Thank you so much for sharing such valuable content!!!
Oh thank heaven.. babysitting toddlers and dogs has my car in dire sorts
How did it look when it dried? It always looks good when it’s still wet
Ur stuipd that’s not 0 dollars worst video of all time
Really works but what if you don't have a shop vac like me
You guys won't believe this, but I actually took the 91% rubbing alcohol and blotted it with a micro fiber cloth (blot means I tap on the stain surface NOT rubbing or scrubbing it) Then I applied the wet vac and it was like magic. The stains disappeared. Alcohol is fast drying so I didn't have to wait long with the windows down before driving. I guess the only con is the alcohol smell, but meh it doesn't last long because I flood my truck with chemical guys air fresheners anyway and those air fresheners smell very chemically too ... I don't mind it though😅😅😅
Thank you. Definitely have to try this out.
Hmmm, I’ve searched for shop vacs but can’t seem to find any for “zero dollars”…maybe fix the title?
I know a newfie when i hear one 😂
Is there a preferred shop vac or will any do? I'm just trying to get a feel of how much I should spend on one.
'Let the sun do it's job' - bugger - I live in the UK!
Thank you!
It cost money for a shop vac and spray bottle. I could have it professionally done for cheaper!
I don’t have shop vac. Fake news. Jk
Dude your intro is weird 😂😂
Hi came across your channel, question how long do you leave the dawn and warm water soaking on the car seat 💺
Not zero dollars
What if I don’t have a shock vac
Thank you
I might actually give this a try. I somehow got stains in my seats in my car and my car is only a year old and I got the car in August so needless to say, I'm not happy about the stains. I want to get them out of the seats if I can.
Wow, so many people impressed by the results when they followed this advice, and apparently none (I didn't read all 1,347 comments as of 11/4/2024) that should have later figured out that a key part of the process was missing from this video (and then updated their comments.)  That is; rinsing the (soapy) solution out of the upholstery is absolutely critical to maintaining the results achieved by the actual cleaning!  Doesn't matter which wonderful/fantastic solution you go with.  Pretty much all soaps/cleansers, when diluted and left imbedded in any kind of fabric, become a magnet for dirt.  Notap gives the same advice for when your cars seatbelt doesn't retract like it should; just clean it with soapy water!  Wow, how easy was that?  But when it stops retracting like it should shortly thereafter...?  Could that have anything to do with the cleaning you performed not too long ago???  Whether it's clothing, the carpeting in your home, or the upholstery/carpeting in your car, you have to ensure that all of whatever cleaning agent you used is completely removed; otherwise, your setting yourself up for even more problems, and on a more regular basis.
....... then about 50 years ago, some brilliant person had an epiphany and said "there's an easier way" or they created stronger, harsher chemicals to clean stains faster 😂
Zero dollar my a$$
Can we use regular carpet vaccum cleaner?
I own a KIA Sportage that my husband uses for work, I will have to try this I hope it works like a charm, any suggestions on how to deep clean the dash and center console? Thanks for the video, I will update comment when I try this
Excellent!!
Make sure you remove the filter from your shop vac first if you're sucking up liquid!
Man you have got to scrub it some. No need to keep to doing it multiple times.. just spray & scrub to break the stain up then apply vacuum suction. Another tip is to add 70%clear alcohol in the mixture then spray scrub apply suction
Thanks you just saved me a bunch of money hiring a mobile detailing Service. Subscribed and like.
for free if you do have shopvac yes....
Thanks !
Zero dollars...except the cost of a shop-vac that I don't already have. 🥲
Your video is truly impressive! The old item cleaning solution at timestamp 1:59 helped me restore my old items easily and effectively. Thank you for sharing this wonderful tip!
Will it clean chocolate
Just tried it on 4 year old coffe stains, works.
Thank you  It worked great for me  Regards Jeff
You just saved me 150 buck i was going to take it to a detail shop but its really just the seats that have some stains the car is brand new 😅
Not zero dollar.
Really helped, first DIY that actually works
I used Dawn with a 5" drill brush. Works better I think, you could shop vac after, but I just used microfiber towels and air dried overnight.
Now just need a shop vac! 😅
Great, I have all the supplies.  I'm thinking of getting seat covers any idea.  I keep it clean, but any water if small spill stains quickly.
Great video thank you
Can you mix laundry detergent instead of dish soap?
This is great man thank you for posting.
And when it dries….
Keep winning my guy
NicEEEEEEEE, Thanks very much!
You saved me 50€ of detailing services, even 5years after this video❤
He did say not A cent. So if its dollars he didn't lie technically
How about Spray, Agitate, then Vacuum… all in one pass!!!…
Thanks it really helped
Thank you
Well, it isn't zero dollars if you don't have a shop vac.
I'm gonna tryit😊
Instructions unclear the shop vac I don’t own got stuck up my ass
Thank you🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
need to buy a shop vac, not free.
Im guessing that a "shop vac" in the US. Is what we call a "wet and dry vac" in every other English speaking country around the world.
Thank
Thanks so much for your time and great tip,going to do my headrests now
Hey Chris, great vid.  do you have a trick for cleaning foggy headlights?  Searched your page but didn't see anything
Going point re: making multiple passes.
Thanks Chris, I'm gonna try your fix first before spending money on it.
So simple and effective. Thank you.
I have a regular vacuum does that works?
What if you don’t have a vacuum
"Won't cost you a cent."  "Ok first thing you're going to need is a $50 machine"
"for zero dollars"  "a few thing you will need, first thing is your shop vac"  So where do I buy a shop vac for ZERO DOLLAR?!
Too bad that it's winter and cloudy. Going to have some damp seats lol
@Chris Notap Got the Easiest way,may I know if it's ok for you to review our foam cannon S V3.0?Thanks in advance!😊
If you don't have a shop vac just go to the car wash an use that vacuum but make sure it has good suction..ive been fooled by a good looking machine and it didnt have good suction if you know what i mean
Dawn be removing oil from birdies an stains from seats amen , i use dawn on my stains on my daughter's clothes an anything I've left on my shirt
A shopvac is NOT zero dollars dude
Hello....hope it gets out my stains....Will try it tomorrow. Thanks for your advice
I guess you can do it at a car wash place if you don't have a shop vac?
dont have a vaccuum so what do i do?
does cold water get the job done in a similar way?
Works great! I picked up a cheap $12 clear extractor end off amazon. Comes with two hose fittings. Nice to see all that dirty water being extracted. Don't forget to remove your regular dust filter from your vac.
Kindly brush after soap spray for better results.
Great video sir. After you spray the seat, do u wait a while before vacumming for the soap to do its job. Or is it good to do right away so it doesnt dry?, hence nothing to vaccum...
Simple and easy outstanding 2 minutes video nicely done.
is that a regular vaccum?
What if i dont have a shop vac?
As an auto detailer I suggest using a drill brush  on the area with the water then vacuum. After vacuum let a few microfiber towels sit on the seat. This is to prevent wicking.
I thought you said it wouldn't cost me a cent?  We're using water, soap, and electricity.  Those things aren't free.
Awesome
They look good now but what if you don't have a shop vac...what do you do then ?
Hi! Will using the shop vac get rid of the outline when it dries? I’ve been so frustrated while cleaning the car seats because when it dries, an outline of the cleaner liquid appears.
It wont cost you a cent! First thing you need is a shop vac!
Worked like a charm today, removing all the grime after finally taking out the booster seat in the back of the SUV.  Timeless tip!  Thank you.
Thank you brother. A genuine budget video
Every time I try this I can see the border of where I vacuumed.
He begins by saying, "I'm going to show you how to clean your car seats and it won't cost you a cent." Then the camera cuts to a Shop-Vac and he proceeds to use a Shop-Vac. I think those cost at least a cent.🙄 I definitely wouldn't be here if I had a cent and if I had a Shop-Vac. Js... The cleaning solution to use is obvious. How to clean a car seat without a Shop-Vac isn't.😢
You should agitate the cleaner with a brush. Dollar-store brushes should be adequate. I also get the dish soap freom the dollar-store.
Nice video! Now I’m wondering, say there was a little squabble and now there’s blood all over the back seat. How would you clean that? Asking for a friend…
He said it won’t cost u a cent but this setup up cost over $1k😂
Should’ve got a brush to agitate the stain.
So useful!! Thank you so much 😊 also, that bridge is around the corner from my house! Awesome clip of the ship going through lock one 👌
After realizing i just cannot take the fabric off and stick it in my washer machine, I found your video - YEAY thanks
I really need to get a shopvac ,, don't think my dyson will like the water.
I think it's better to say it takes "very little time" to do this, rather than "no time!" 😊
Had hot cheeto throw up.  I took my car to the car wash used a spray bottle with hot water and dawn soap and used a brush to scrub. Worked great a few passes and it looked better then before.
Thank you. Like the baking soda addition also. Probably my 5 hp shop vacuum will be a bit better than your little guy.
This managed to get years of coffee stains out of my passenger seat and floor boards! Thank you for posting
Thank you for video.
Won't cost me  cent, hope your cleaning with wishin and dreamin... how much that shop vac cost?  how much that squirt bottle cosT? how much that dish soap cosT? how much that rag cosT? what dat Electrcity cost ro tun the shop vac?
good
Wow! So simple! I have some coffee stains. I hope it works for me.
Thx so much! I discovered my used car had coffee ☕️ stains in the seat (stained my passengers’ white clothes!!) .. i was dreading the task.. but easy w moderate scrubbing w rags & a hand vac! You are my new bff!
“Wont cost you a cent” *Pulls out a shop vac* lol
Worked great on my RAV4!   Thanks
Thanks for the review! I'll try this on my car seats which have some kinds of dirt, but can you please write here what is the blue liquid that you added to your bottle spray?
I will use this knowledge to clean the whole interior of my now first car! (Bought a Maxima 2012 a week ago)
What about for blood stains 👀😳   Joking ofc 😂
I agree the “won’t coast you a cent “ isn’t true for the average person who doesn’t have a shop vac. How about how to clean using everyday house hold items? I would love to clean some stains but with normal everyday products.
My wife has the same kind of material looking seats in her Chevy trailblazer, but the best part of the video was that bridge where that boat went where they lift up that bridge that be cool to see more of that Chris take it easy
I always vacuum first. The best cleaner is simple green spray liberally, scrub with soft bristle brush , microfiber towel and a shop vac.
Funny of you to assume I have a shop vac sitting around.
The use of 50% warm water + 50% alcohol ( any common type .. NON SMELLY  fire burner Ethanol or Isopropyl alcohol ) will do the cleaning  WITHOUT leaving any residue , when evaporated .... detergent works well , but might leave a ( slight ? ) slimy residue ( NOT  what you want on your seat ! !  ..... hope this ( tried - n - tested ) tip helps .......... DAVE™ .............
Great tip. If anyone doesn’t have a shop vac get one. They’re worth every penny.
Lol I call bs on this ...
The dawn and hot water works so much better when you use some sort of brush to brush it in. I use a nylon mid sized brush,  it any brush would work just fine.
Sorry, Wats tht chemical...
Can we do this with dry vacuum cleaner? My vacuum cleaner does not support wet.
I use the dawn powerwash. I actually agitate the stain, let sit and use a shop vac.
Thats great I don't have to pay to clean my car seats
who woulda thunk it
Me: Does it at night in 32 degree weather  Him: Leave your windows open and let it air out
Ta mate, what a cracking video. My parents car was stolen & finally recovered by the Police after six months, the seats had mould, dirt & glass on them. From England, God bless.
God bless and Prayers!!!❤️❤️❤️
thanks for the video! your tip worked like a charm! Btw, to the suggested solution i also added the cleaning vinegar - it helps to remove unpleasant "aromas". :)
Thank you!
Thank you! Getting my car ready to sell and the seats have seen better days lol..
Will this stain black seats??
Where'd u get a shopvac for $0?
It doesn’t cost anything if you have a shop vac and a squirt bottle laying around…
When the seats dry it doesn’t leave a stench?
What happens if you have an older stain?
Btw I hit the liked button and subscribed
This worked but it doesn’t have to be a shop vac. I did it with my regular eureka vacuum that I bought off of Amazon for $50. It works like a charm. The stain was 2 years old but finally I saw this and decided to give it a try with a regular vac and it worked really well. My car seats are brand new now
Zero Dollars: "First thing you'll need is your shop vac." Good lord people.
So are you telling me that the best way to clean it is to CLEAN it??? Truly, an internet-shattering video.
I feel dumb now, thanks for the advice!
Thank you for this video!  I like the simple method you used with products I already have on hand.
K, off to buy a shop vac... 🤷‍♂️
Just use normal vacuum cleaner? The water from the seat will not damage the vacuum?
does it also remove smell?
Let that sink in guys 😉
How to clean your seats without you spending a cent! Proceeds to use 5 cleaner gadgets, 8 liquid soaps, 3 towels and hires 2 workers to help you get the job done👌
What about coffee and girl’s butterflies blood stains?
Great, where can I get the free shop vac? Since this should cost zero dollars 🧐
Where can i buy one of those vacuums for free?
It won’t cost you a cent  “First thing is your shop vac”
Great video
What If coffee cup spilled and the seats got stoked deeply with coffee.  The more I vacuum the more stains kept coming up
I have so many products,all I need is a vacuum,brush,dish soap? I'll try it.
Worked great for me, I microwaved the soapy water and added a bit of fabric sanitizer and my 06 250's interior looks and smells great now, thanks for the tip! I was going to rent an extractor and now instead with my savings I am drinking a thirty rack in the backseat just marveling at it.
Do you have any vacuum alternatives? Maybe a lint roller, or a hand brush? 😅 Sorry. Just trying to work with what I have. Thank you for this awesome vid and tip. 🙌
So simple -just one question -can you do this in seats that have heaters ?
Thanks! Just saved me $200 because these detailing folks can be rude af and still not get the grime my OCD still sees 😩
If you agitated the seat would have been easier.
maybe dry vac first. and scrub the wetted area before wetvac...?
It’s gonna cost something buddy nothing is free
LOL No
Thanks so it’s no excuse for Uber and Lyft drivers to pick up customers with their back seats full of nasty stains.  I always report them and give them one star. Stop being lazy and clean it! They expect customers to sit on those nasty stain when they can just clean as us did.
What if no vacuum cleaner, I don't have one
The 🐐
The thing is, your seat cloth and stitching is extremely easy to clean. You can clean that with just water and towel. Try cleaning a Prius seat. Specifically the grey seats. Or those polyester type seats. Good luck.
Epic fail. "zero dollars" assumes that everyone has a shop vac.
Would it be fine if I wipe away the excess water with a towel instead of a vaccum?
So is there actually a way to do this without a shop vac?
Boy this worked SOOO good, thank you very much for the simple and clear instructions.  Wish I took a before pic cause this looks SO great now.  Definitely a must keep video and totally worth sharing.
Can i use portal vaucum, i do not have a steamer
Can we do this normal vacuum ?
Great tip, of you are allergic to fumes or any other cleaning product.
Is it alright on dark seats won't cause it to fade a bit right?
Ur an angel
False advertising. Cost about 200 cents
BOUT TO GO GET IT DONE. WISH ME LUCK
Owned my own upholstery cleaning business years ago. We used to hate guys that posted stuff like this. Why you ask? Because it works 🤣
check me out,   I own an upholstery shop and show videos of our work,   check it out,  Subscriber here for Life
You gotta agitate the dirty spot
If you have this method at hand and must use it,i guess, but this is not the way to do it.
This worked perfectly I went by 7/11 and got a Mountain Code Red from fountain machine I accidentally spelt it on the passenger seat I used this technique and the seat looks brand new again I am showing this to all my friends and family how have fabric car seats
Did you use an extractor vacuum or just a regular vacuum?
I’m British so I’m not sure if it applies or if it’s any different but would a Hoover do the same job?
I feel like if you're looking for a "zero dollar" way of cleaning your car, you probably don't own a shop-vac lol
Zero dollars - until you have to purchase a wet/dry vacuum cleaner
Totally helpful and awesome thanks
It’s raining 🌧
Also thanks for the tips
I can recognize that Canadian accent from a mile away eh
Okay but that intro part when he was typing on that keyboard thing he made,  so oo cute and wholesome
,,,,,,yea, it really was Simple as that, thanks CN!
Bro you just saved me 250 for detailing
Yay love the video! thanks a lot!
I don't have a shop vac.  What else can I use?
sub logo ko ak ak machine send karo
machine kaha se le kar ae
hahahaha $0 if you have the $250 + Extractor Vac
i ll try it thanks!!
I don't have water type of vacuum; thus, this won't help me at all, for I'm retired on a fixed income and don't want to spend money for another vacuum.
Thanks! Ill definitely try it out!
Very helpful THANKS!!!
"No money not a cent" pulls out a shopvac
Busting out that soapy wooder
Excellent and to the point
For zero dollars…  But time is money….liar 😒
!!! WTH I LOVE THIS MAN! I was getting so depressed over spilling food over my car seats
Clear, concise, and it works. Extra points for not beginning with “Hey what’s up, guys?” I think “Hi everybody” is somehow a bit less annoying.
Thank you that helped a lot!!
This video helped me out a lot
You just simplified a complex process... Excellent work.
Wait, why isn't this video at least 30 minutes long with him telling me his life story and how his dog just went into surgery and stuff before getting to the point of the video? Oh, video was made in 2017, that explains a lot.  Also I hope your dog is doing great.
Great tip thank you chris!
Helpful video.  Thank you.
Why the dish soap and not the laundry detergent? They are fabric seats.
Wow! That worked great. I will make sure to rinse off the soap as other have recommended. Wish I had before and after pictures of my work truck which I want to sell.
was the intro with the ship going by in Port Colborne?
Ummm yeah “stains” on the car seat right gents 😉
The hypnotic scanner connoly offer because whorl dolly chop by a upbeat piano. grubby gruesome, smelly professor
It is smart , homemade carpet cleaner type of thing
I’ll have try this. I’ve got a few chocolate stains that literally will not come out from nothing.
Loved this thank you!
Worked straight away I only needed to go over it once! Thank you so much!😃
Goat
Now that I know how to clean my car seats, I can start having sex again! Yay!
Welp now i know what to do with the seats in my car
Thank you for uploading this awesome video.
Can i use a Henry Vacuum cleaner?
Eventhough I don’t own a shop vac, I definitely used this and a self wash vacuum cleaner, worked the same way.   YOU SAVED MY SEATS! Thank you
To state the obvious, it costs zero dollars only if you already own a shop-vac
Good idea and it does the job
Great video! Not overcomplicated and to the point!  More videos like this will get noticed. Needed this to clean my ridiculously dirty interior today. Thank yiu!
As a Canadian, I never understood when Americans said we pronounced "about" differently, but after watching this video I realize some of us really do!
Great tip. Let you no how it turns out. I  was ready  purchase new seat cover. Thanks!
$0? I don’t have a shop vac 😆
thanks for the short yet informative video. will be trying this
Would it help to reapply Scotchgarde after the seat dries? Save your cleaning spray for bug killer, it works great and it's much cheaper.
Thanks for the advice
Thank you for this video, much appreciated!
But really. It's so easy. Dish washing liquid. Is so good.i also use it to clean the arms on my cloth furniture..  It seems a lot of simple products do the job that some companies. Can make.  Very expensive 😡😡
Awesome!
5-17-21 : Just tried this and it seems to have worked!  We’ll see when everything dries...
Great, nice video and easy explanation , thanks!
Oh great! Fantastic! All the nice words you get! Haha But seriously this might help me.
And this will cost you ZERO dollars. Okay first thing you need is a >$100 shop vac you probably don't have :)
Thanks!
I can’t wait to give this a try!
"zero dollars" .. needs shopvac .. smh
GOAT
Just done this after watching. Worked a treat.  Thank you
Cool video, thank you
Good idea
Nice ... I like your YouTube channel ( and I thought I was a handyman)
Thank You! VERY ENCOURAGING! Gonna give it a try!!!
Huh, I consider myself pretty handy and creative, but I would have never thought to try something this simple/easy. Thanks, I want to give it a shot.
I tried this for 30 minutes but the stains are still there😒😒😒
But it is still Corolla 😵
Wow thank you!!
Idk. I feel like shop vacs barely have power. But youre saying they essentially do the same or similar job to extractor machines if you do this? Smh no way. Yes an extractor would be super nice but theyre like 150 200 bucks for quality ones. Meanwhile a shop vac is like 20 30 40 bucks and most everyone should have one. I mean why not. Lol its funny people bitching about that or joking. Technically to be super free..well hell use a rag or scrub with something. Most likely youll get a similar outcome. Its jusy many have a shop vac, and they are... used for dry AMD wet so why not
😯 where you got that keyboard?
Dude, this saved me a lot of time and shopping. Perfect! Thanks for posting!
Thank you for the helpful video!!
Two tips that will massively improve the process: Replace the water with vinegar and use a scrub brush to agitate it briefly before vacuuming. It could be improved even further if you smear a little bit of baking soda over the seat beforehand and have a second sprayer with plain water to saturate while vacuuming for a makeshift extractor.
What year corolla
Great video
People that don’t have a shop vac... go to a car wash that has vacuums?
OMG this is awesome. Thanks for the video
0:36 sounds like the opening to Bob Marley - three little birds
Use a couple bucks to buy a brush to agitate the liquid on the seats the vacuum as the video shows, finally add some clean water just like the soapy solution and give it a last good vacuuming
Dawn "dish soap" causes Cancer like into it
What is a shop vac ?
8
I can’t believe how well this works, thank you so much.
Thank you sir, very helpful!
Really helpful man. Thanks.
Why did I click on this video I dont even have a car
Hmm....think I might try this.. eating pizza and KFC don't do well on seat's..🤔
Don't have a shop vac, but will try to bother a friend to loan me one. Seems simple enough. Appreciate the video.
Wow amazing short and no promo product video 👍
What kinda car?
thanks i was about to buy some oxiclean too
Does this work on old stains? If so im going to try it
Thank you for the video Don!!!
Loveit thanks
great video, no bullshit straight and simple.
Can you use a normal vacuum?
Well, i have heated seats, it is ok to use liquids?
Thanks for the tips. Peace.
Will this work on black seats ?
THANK YOU! The video was straight to the point and very helpful (I tend to lose interest in the 6-8 min videos haha).
I DO have a shop vac, spray bottle, and a bit of sense - THANK!
I have the same shop vac! 😄
Just what I needed! Thank you sir!
What kind of vacuum is that?? Normal or water sucker??? Please reply ..if I could do this with my air sucker vacuum
Yes thank u so much this video showed me u can use ur everyday water vacuum as an extractor instead of spending thousands of dollars on a extractor very helpful to remove a stain with your everyday cleaning materials
I thank you so much, you a life saver, I almost threw away a $200 for interior on the car💯💰
Stains in my car: So you thought this was going to be easy huh  Edit: the stains eventually came up, just gotta be patient with it. Thanks for the video!
Worked like a charm. I was worried that I was going to have to pay someone to get a couple of stains out. Thanks!
I suggest Zonrox bro
Whats the blue liquid ?
Amazing! Thanks!
Also Pro tip. Deep stains will need multiple washes. I.E. wait until material is dry, repeat. When the material dries it pushes up dirt and whatnot, meaning the more cleans you do the more better the results will be.
Man I just tried this, went mudding few weeks ago seats we smothered in dry dirt, worked great!! Thanks man you saved me nearly $200 getting it shampooed
If y’all do smart go to a car wash and use the vacuums using this method 😂🤷‍♂️
I use dish soap and a little Oxyclean powder to clean my seats.  After I clean and vacuum them, I go over them again with fresh clear water to remove any leftover soap.  Soap residue will collect dirt and can contribute to future staining!
Used a different mixture but same technique .. Let it dry overnight we'll see ,.there was like a liquid water stain and I wanted that out . like I said we'll see . If not good enough . I'll try your mixture of Dawn and water next
tip number one:  DONT GET A CAR WITH CLOTH SEATS
Looks simple enough...
Appreciate your video!! Keep up the good work!
My Shop Vac sucks LOL I guess I need to buy a new one this looks so EASY:) Thanks 4 sharing!
Nice! 🙏🏽👌🏽👍🏽
You may plz. Explain what exactly the chemical you are using for cleaning
Wow...
Worked awesome!!! Great tip!! Thanks
brb buying a shopvac that doesn't cost me anything.
A simple trick is to put towels on the seat, much cheaper too.
thank you!!!!
Two words: BABY WIPES. Baby wipes take out every stain
Ty for the video,  I'm going to give it a try...🤞🤞🤞
It work man one love
Would a regular hand vacuum work too??? ✨
I just use wet wipes. it’s much quicker and has the same results.
Idk just my thoughts if you have a vehicle and you wanna keep clean, a shop vac is a must have!
Wont cost a scent, ok but I dont have a shop vac
This guy sounds a little like Scotty Kilmer and acts a little like Chris Fix.... Hmmmmm
I was hoping that I was going to see how to clean it using a rag and hot water... but no... I don’t have a shop vac! Or dawn... or spray bottles...
Thank you for this!
When the seats dry don’t the stains pop back up
Can l use fairy for this
thank very helpfull 👍👍🙏🏻
There is a god! Thank you! Im on a budget and this really helped. You are awesome
Thank you for this video
Cool
What an idiotic video....
Thank you... Worked great for me...
Thank you!!!
Thanks for a helpful video.  Ignore the simpletons who are too dense to appreciate your efforts.
Thanks a lot got my Jeep looking great again and I really didn’t think I could do it by my self until now. Thanks again!!!!!!!
Assumes the stain is removable (water soluable) most are not
So I have to go buy a shop vac...Fthat
is it ok to use regular vaccuum ?
smart and very simple thank you
I put dishsoap on my seat with water and left a big mark?
Just need a shop vac now...
Will this work for mud stains?
Thank you for the video.I’m going to try this myself.
It's basically a steam cleaner vac....  You can find a good steam vac for pretty cheap...
can i do this without using a shop vac? instead im gonna use a dry towel will it work?
You did a good job.👍👍👍👍
Thankyou very helpful video
Thank you for the helpful information!!! 😊
Nice Shop-Vac what brand / model
Zero dollars: “first thing you’ll need is yiu 120$ shop vac”
For ZERO DOLLARS: Pulls out a big vacuum 😂😂
Would you recommend agitation from a detail brush after you spray the soapy water then vac? Or no scrubbing
Perfect just what I needed to know 👌
Thank you!!  A passenger in my car had a bathroom emergency and was too late getting to a bathroom.  So, brown stain on the cloth seat pad.  I look up what my options are on YouTube.  I have dawn, I have a spray bottle, I have water, and I have a powerful wet/dry vac.  I followed your video.  After several pass of spray and vac the stain is gone!  I left the front windows and moon roof open.  An hour later the seat was dried and looking like new!  Thank you again!  Plus it was nice to be able to use what I already had in the house to get it done.
Nice Welland Canal.
Or you just take out the covers and wash them🤷🤷👀😶😂😂
"Not gonna cost you a cent" *Pulls out a whole shop vac* 🖕🏿
Awesome video!! You saved me from paying someone else to do this for me!
Is this a regular vacuum cleaner or a wet vac?
Does this help to get rid of seat dust
This is a good video in really easy to do
Too bad I don't have the machine
"It won't cost you a cent.".......... Unless you don't have a shop vac.
It won’t leave a weird scent in the car ?
Hey! Thanks for the tutorial. I plan on doing this tomorrow. Do you know if this works well on car floors too? The carper underneath my car's floor mats is could use some cleaning as well.
that's cool actuallly
I think I have everything I need.... Oh crap I need a car!
Just tried this, worked great. awesome vid brotha.
Had some stains I just couldn’t get out yesterday I will go back in try this right quick
It'll be much cheaper buying Tuff Stuff at Autozone for $8.
Great video!  People think stains will magically go away...please!  Go buy a shop vac , people!
Just did this on my black cloth seats that had discoloration from unknown stains (2 young kids) haha worked great!
This works. Its basically a cheaper homemade carpet cleaner. Its the same thing in concept, but the steam cleaner is just fancier: spray and vacuum button on the handle, sprayer is a nozzle exterior to and next to the vacuum end. U can also use a soft brush to work in/out the water before vacuuming it.
baking soda and vinager, works better
Will a normal vacuümcleaner do the job?
Instructions were unclear and I started washing myself instead of the car
Thankyou
can i use ajax?
So helpful! And I don't have to inhale a bunch of harsh chemicals. Thank you
Came here because i came there.... on my car seat..... you know what i mean
Neat
Lol people who literally didn't think it was going to cost a cent? Are you serious? Of-course it's going to cost something if you don't have it, the only way this shift is free is if you get cleaning products off of craigslist do some how 😂
lifesaver! thank you!! 👏🏾💛
Agitate the stain with medium soft brush before vacuum, way more effective.
Thank you Chris.  Saving me from a pinto bean leftovers accident after family dinner across town.
Best and easiest advice ever
What if you don’t have a shop vac???
This is great but it wouldn't cost me zero $. It'd cost me the price of a shop vac.
What if you don’t have a shop vac
Y con manchas que no salen así, que haces?
Got a stain on my car seat the other day, so happy I found this video so I can get that stain out now! Thank you good sir!
I gave you a thumb's down because your video didn't help. There is no sun here in MA.
Thanks Big Man!!! saved me some time. So i got a brand spankin new clean car off the dealer. Next day my dog jumped right it and did some dirty business inside :) so here i am lol.
what if i dont have a wet/dry shopvac?
Thanks man
This is the worst color you can get
It’s costed me 2 cents but worked so I guess it’s goid
can you do it with a regular vacuum cleaner?
People never use soap ever!!!!
Thank you I'm gonna use my local vac at this car wash.
2 things you missed--scrub the stain with fingertips and a final rinse with plain hot water to remove soap residue
Zero dollars but I don’t have a shop vac. Lol 😂
Cool trick, but your video title needs adjustment!
"You can use your mouth if you don't have a shop vac on hand"
I haven't found a diy for cleaning heated seats. I'm too afraid to spray water on them. If anyone knows a video about cleaning heated seats, I'd appreciate it alot!!
I like the vacuum method much better than scrubbing with a cloth / brush, I will try it the next time I clean my cloth seats. .
Resolve carpet cleaner is even better than just Dawn dishsoap and hot water.
Thank you , saved me a lot of time and money. Now, let's get to work.
you steal it
Straight to the point, thank you
Ok . NEXT!!!
Lol it was free for me cuz I stole all the products
Going to try this
I need a car first so I can make a stain.
I will say even though my black leather seats sucked in the summer, they were super easy to clean.
Hot water  ? does it remove makeup   ?
Is this safe to use on black cloth? I hope it won't discolor the shade of the material...
You ain’t even gonna scrub the seat before sucking up the water? Scrub the seats or you’re not even doing anything!
Nice, just that drying part - winter is coming :(
first thing yu r going 2 hav 2 du: FORBID ANYONE 2 eat in the car.    @ least especially any child
All these noises gave me mw2 PTSD
Zero dollars if you own a shop vac
no my seats have even more stains lmao
I busted in my car but she didn’t swallow and moved her head and now it’s all over my seats!
Hello can i use regular vaccum or need to be shopvac?
Worked like a charm! Thank you.
$0 ?? I don’t have a shop vac !
Normal vacuum (floor uses) works?
Regular vaccume cleaner work like a shark?
Really helpful
0 dollars if you own everything in the video....dot let the caption full you. practically clickbait
Suck them farts out
That’s great! Any tips on how to clean in between the seats and car door and center console without removing the seats?
new subscriber TAHNK YOU !  You just Save me $150 on upholstery cleaning 👌
Instructions unclear. Shop vac stuck in drying machine. Please send help.
Worked perfectly. Many thanks!
What is a shop vac?
GTFOH LMAO
Awesome it works thankyou very very very very much
must be canuck.......about sounds like a boat  lolz
Gonna try it tomorrow, using the cold water, then hot water method. I'll keep you posted!
Why the is there an edit video with music for the intro, just get to the point. Draw bridges don't have anything to do with car interior.
Thanks for sharing.
Awesome and very helpful video. Only one problem, what if we don't own a shop vac? Haha.
Just buy, or rent a shampooer/extractor.  In most cases I find the stain would be removed on the first pass. This will save you $, because you're using less electric. 😎
will a hand held vacum do it?
Thanks, these other idiots went you to listen to their bs for fifteen minutes but your technique is what is happening!
Worked like magic!! Thank you 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Very helpful.
This worked so perfectly!! Thank you for saving me so much money :D *student life*
thanks...I will try this tomorrow!
Use a small brush on the stains and the job will take less spraying and rinsing.
I do not have a shop vac, I do not have dish soap, I don’t have hot water I do not have electric I do not have a spray bottle and I don’t have a car.
How long it's been there for
Will this work with power seats ?
It won't cost a cent, but u will need a shop vac! 🗣 *News Flash EVERYONE INCLUDING ME DON'T HAVE A SHOP VAC CONVENIENTLY LAYING AROUND!!*
This is my pet peev. U will never keep that cloth clean. When drys. Its crusty. The seeat soaks it up..
Great tip, thanks
Any vacuum could do that or you need a certain one ?
The "Zero Dollars" title is absolute bollocks so don't bother trying to justify it. Anyway, you'd be better off using one of the good carpet cleaners in a spray can, then letting the area dry and vacuuming as you would with a carpet...cost maybe a dollar as you won't use it all.
Thank you for this
Thank you...👌👍👏👏👏
Great video! Although if you would've used some kind of brush to agitate the stain after spraying it, it would've been gone after one pass
Add some club soda vinegar and backing soda and it work great with the heat
No time, well mr no tap I am not the flash like you.
Simple and easy. Thanks for sharing!
Had a guy detail my SUV last week. Said he worked and worked on interior, which indeed was dirty, but couldn't get it any better trying all, which wasn't much better to me.  Next days became more pissed. Went out to my car with a diluted 1 to 10 Simple Green spray bottle. All I did is make a few swipes of 4 very small areas here and there, and the stains came off. My new rag was FILTHY.  Hard to come by Money down the drain. Since disabled, will hire friend's 15 yrs old and instruct to do the Simple Green with my shop vac. CHRIS: don't pay a bit of attention to the ugly comments posted. THANKS for your video.
Why no scrubbing or baking soda?
The advice was priceless.. the material needed, well most have it on hand or are local to a car wash..js:)
Does this work for water stains?
This cost me $77. $69 for the shop vac and $4 for the soap and spray bottle, including tax. Not really zero dollars now is it?
Does it work with a Home Vacuum Cleaner?
Thanks
where do i sign up for the free shop vac?
Wow, a car cleaning video that doesn’t have any BS sponsored “wonder cleaner product” AND is only TWO MINUTES?? Holy ****, am I on the right website?? What??
It works to my car perfectly thanks
This is a man who cares about his audience
And how do you get the soap out? You need a hoover or rug doctor to go over everything so the soap doesn't dry on the seats because that will attract more dirt.
Thank you chief
Will this work on wet farts that are deep in the seat?
I want to live where he lives. Apparently water, electricity, dish soap, and squirt bottles are free.
If I had a shopvac to begin with, why would I be searching for videos???
Does this method work well with the car carpet?
I bought some crap from autozone yesterday and it made my seat worse and now my car smells like chemicals !  Do you think this will help
Thank god I have a shop vac lol
Liquid laundry detergent is probably better than dish soap for a large variety of soiling substances.   I'd also forgo the shop vac & just use a terri cloth or micro-fiber cloth to reduce the residue dampness in the fabric.   Otherwise, good vid, thx!
Wow 👍🏻👍🏻
For all of the pinheads who are talking about shop vac:  Go to a car wash and use their vac!   We'll go over how to tie our shoes next time.
Thanks for the video! It’s a good idea that I can try for my 1st car. It’s  an old car,  a 1996 Toyota Camry.
capitalism has left a few of us in disarray Chris!
I want to know how to get the dust off my convertibles cloth seats
You just soaked the seats , once it completely dries, spots will be back lol
Thank you! I’m going to try this after work.
Did he say “ice hot water” 😂
Thank you ❤️
I like your video and appreciate your effort to add interest for your viewers.  I'm going to try this, thank you!
If only it was that easy with all the stains seriously dude come on you definitely never detailed a car not all stains comes out that easy
👍👍
Wow nice, thx for the tutorial ^^
Whats a car?
Blimey! This works for me! The seats on my 2001 VW T4 California Generation campervan were disgusting.  Generation edition upholstery is pale green and grey. You only have to look hard at it to get a stain.  I've tried all sorts of foam car upholstery cleaners over the last two years and all they did was spread the stain. So I used your method then turned on the engine,  put the heated seat controls to max, switched on the diesel fuelled night heater at 30°C then closed all the doors and left it to run for 45mins. Worked like a dream. No more stains. I wish I'd known this when I had my  T4 Generation Multivan. Many, many thanks for this. Now nice and clean and all ready for our forthcoming 3 week Scottish roadtrip.
Thank you so much!! I can do this!! 👏🏼👍🏼❤️✌🏼
Lol look at all these bum trolls. I have all of that fortunately but thanks for the video. Didn’t realize it was that easy. Saved me like 100 bucks to get it “shampooed”
Or just go to Home Depot buy folex and spray agitation and wipe with clean towel and done
Can this work for the floor mat too?
Thanks for the video! Strange intro, but that is moot lol.
Man, this was simple but really effective! Thank you!
I'm sorry you have to endure all of the ignorant remarks. Thanks for the video it's very helpful.
I'm going to do this after a vinegar/baking soda treatment. Farm kid for my whole life, with two younger siblings, in the fee years I've had my car I've gotten a few stains that I can't seem to remove with aerosol spray cleaners. This looks like it'll do the trick!
Will this work for older stains? I just bought a used car from a dealer. And there's a small black stain on the back seat
Do I need to use my water filter for this? I know stupid question lol
Will this remove old coffee stains ?
I love sucking it up🤷🏼‍♀️
Electricity, dish soap, and fuel to heat the water are not free...........
What protection i should use after cleaning the cloth seats
Simply a very good idea. I will definitely try this.  Thank you Sir.
All I need is shop vac, but at least I know how now. Thanks
It really helped! thank you so much
Does it get out cum stains? Just asking for a friend
I don't know what a shop-vac is.
Chris you are amazing
I have everything it's required, i can do it for Free, thank you!
Instructions unclear my cars sinking to the bottom of a lake
Dish soap can remain behind a d cause new dirt to stick.  I would use plain cold water to rinse at the end, then vacuum that up.
Way more complicated than just spending $5 on turtle wax 😂
Left side is still dirty? That's what I wanna clean
Isn't liquid bad for vacuums? I have a Dyson and it says no liquids.
LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES ITS NOT FOR FREE ..YOU NEED A SPAY BOTTLE THAT A BUCK AT THE DOLLAR STORE ..A SHOP VAC THAT ANYWHERE FROM 50-100$ DOLLARS DISH SOAP THATS ABOUT 4$ BUCKS ELECTRICITY $$ WHO THE HECK KNOWS WHAT THAT WILL COST.. everything come with a dollar sign attached to it.. unless you wanna come do it for me and not charge me then it will be FREEEEEE!!!
You seem like a smart dude, why not agitate with an upholstery brush or even a toothbrush? Lol it would of been gone a lot faster
If you want to do a good job, grab a brush and agitate before you extract with the vacuum.
how much peak power do you need on a shop vac for vehicle cleaning?
A lot of comments here complaining about having to buy a shop vac. As a homeowner and do it your self kinda guy, trust me; shop vacs pay for themselves!
Thank you will be trying this Monday
This will do justice for the cum stains in my backseat
Is it save to extract water with  normal home vacuum
This works and it is easy.  And if you don't have a .79 cent spray bottle or dish liquid and can't go to the magic wand car wash....you might wanna leave this hard stuff to the pros...and see what they charge :)
Simple and effective
Everyones talking about not having a shop vac while my first thought was go to a car wash to use one of theirs
Will a normal vacuum work? I dont own a shop vacuum.
Perfect!  Just what I was looking for.  Quick and concise info, thanks!
Where am I supposed to get a car??
Just throw it away
Amazing video no bullshit straight to the point learned what I wanted to know and I’m omw
Can I use bleach?
What’s the peak horsepower on this shop vac?
I don't have a shop vac, can I use my house hold vac?
You lost me at "fill a squirt bottle with hot water". Water will stain your cloth seats. Never use water. Use the highest percent alcohol or cleaner with no water.
Does it need to be a shop vac or any will do?
Thanks so much
Michael Miller classic dude
Glad I came access this. I didn't realize I could use a cheap shopvac for something like this. Thanks!
A lot of the comments I am reading on here sound like there coming from some ignorant people when he was talking about costing you a cent he was talking about not having to buy a APC(all purpose cleaner), extractor, stain extractor and so on! Many of us have dish soap, hot water and probably a vacuum. As a professional Mobile Detailer I get where he is coming from having to buy other stuff.
Except that they're still there a couple inches down. But that's good enough usually. Sometimes I'll remove the seat (after buying a cheap used car that smelled like the PO) and dumped buckets of boiling water then vacuumed
You should always dry vac first
Expectations: only one spot and done  Reality:did it but found out u have to wash the whole seat cause is dirty and then found out that the 2nd seat and the back seat is also dirty and then some how the back seat stuffing come out and then u have to fking sew it and 2 hrs right there AND THEN FOUND OUT THAT ITS A BUS the last part was a joke
This worked miracles on my GTI seats!!  Thank you!!
This turned my stain orange :(
Why not scrub the cloth a little bit before vacuuming?
thanks to safe time !!!! Appreciated!!!
I know people who live in all sorts of places and situations. It basically comes down to if you've ever cleaned or not, then you'll have a shop vac... Everyone I know cleans, and has one already.  Empty out a cologne/perfume bottle or wait for one to be finished. Use that for soapy spray.
Didn’t cost me a cent😅 I own all three
WTF is a SHOP VAC does he mean like a carpet cleaner or a wet vac - or is talking about, like a Henry hoover?? i dont understand...
Most men have basic tools like a shop vac!
Amazing thank you! I tried this on a giant stain that's been in my used car since I bought it a year ago. Came out almost immediately
$0.00  !?!?! The first thing you need is a car to do this :p
Are you from Minnesota? You have the accent, that's where I'm from haha
Ammonia or windex is 10x more effective then dish soap. Agitate the area a little with a warm/ damp rag and watch the magic!!!
Will it take out water marks out of seats?
The key is dont let the stain sit there for 6 months. Get them stains up asap. Used to do stuff like that for a living.
Shop vac?!?!? Since when are they free! I might as well pay a retailer to clean it! They’re $50 minimum to hire around here!!!
"in no time at all" speeds up video hahaHha
I tried this technique to day and it worked really well, thank you for making this video and sharing your knowledge.
I thought you were gonna light the xar on fire when you said it wouldnt cost a cent
I clicked off of the video when he said the first thing you need is a shop vac. Zero dollars huh? lol
Thank you that's a whole lot easier, especially with arthritis hands.
Dude thanks ...
Wow zero dollars? Too bad I would need to BUY a shop vac to use this method.
Oh my God, the ad that plays right before this video is about the same f****** topic as this video... I sat there watching it thinking I was watching your video till I realized I'm staring at a tad trying to make me spend money for something you're about to teach me how to do for free... That's kind of shity don't you think YouTube
Thank you. Im going to do this in my car
You are a pro
Thank you!!!!
Thank you so much. I've been trying to get coke stains up. Going to use your technique now.
Also you should have rinse the soap from your seat so it doesn't reactivate itself form wet clothes or objects and cause more staining to your seat seat should be properly extracted and rinsed and I would go as far as wiping them out with a microfiber towel upholstery stains can be tricky and look clean while wet but reappear when dry
Only problem I see is that if not done correctly the water can leave behind a stain itself also you should have agitated the stained area of the seat some stains reappear when the seats dry
if you have stains in your seats there is no END to this method - the vacuum will keep pulling up dirt and grime for weeks - you will never get it clean.. Take the seat all the way out of the car - spray it for 5 or 10 minutes with a simple garden hose, this will get EVERYTHING out of the seat... Now, set the heat out in the sun to dry - in florida this only takes a couple of hours in the summer time.. When the seat is dry it will be like BRAND NEW - no mess and it will not make your car have a horrible water smell like this methos will do..  Trust me, I have detailed cars for years, my method is the only one that makes an interior look like new and smell like new..
I kind of always wanted to buy a Shop-Vac now I've  found my reason to go buy one, my car is 8 years old and definitely need to be cleaned!
All you really need is to buy seat covers and they will look brand new
The best video!!!
when he means ZERO DOLLARS , he means living off your mum
stupid , if you add dish soap you add a higher increase chance of mold , as dish soap has lots of salts in
I'm sorry but does this not look like the most dangerous invention for a road? 0:10
Worked like a charm thank you so much
Lmao your name is chris
soapy wooder almost always gets the job done
Chris, our  2005 Jeep Liberty had stains when we bought used some time ago.  Tried vehicle upholstery/carpet cleaners, to no avail. Just saw this today then ran out and tried it. Took some work, but BOOM! gone.  THANK YOU!
Go to a car wash they have vacuum & I’m certain that y’all have any kind of soap to wash dishes if not then I wonder what u use for dishes lmaoook 🤣😂🤦🏻‍♀️
I use oxiclean and TUFF STUFF
The main question is. Can i use a dyson vaccuum?
Ever heard of a brush to agitate area
I will never ever again buy a car with cloth seats I've learned my lesson from now on leather only!! so easy to clean not always the best in extreme hot and cold but so much easier to keep clean.
Many thanks! Even worked on bird poo with a hand vacuum.
Find my favourite tools here!    https://www.amazon.com/shop/chrisnotap
Thank you, this video is very very helpful! God bless you
Im sorry i found the ad to be more useful haha first tume thats ever happened haha
And if you don’t have a spray bottle just put the soap and water on a micro fiber/towel then ring most of it out and pour a little rubbing alcohol on the towel. Go over the stain in one direction several time then in the same direction use a dry towel. Repeat until stain is removed
You can also spray rubbing alcohol on the seat/stain (with the degreaser) and take a dry towel in one direction and pull the stain out that way if you don’t have a shop vac. Micro fibers work the best
How can I get a shop vac, spray bottle, and soap for zero cents?
soap? where the fuck i'm going to get soap
So I need to "BUY" a shop vac, a spray bottle. and does it have to be dawn? Because if so I have to buy that too. Yeah, not exactly 0cents.
Thank You for making this video. Helpful
Used this technique & it worked perfect ! Thank you! & for those who don’t have a shop vac you can just go to those car washes that have the free vacuum & it’ll do the job! That’s what I did.
nice! thanks for the info
Nice tips..❤
I usually do this with a towel or cloth between it, so not too much water is sucked up my vacuum
👍👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Works amazing!!
Would this work on denim stains? The previous owner left some pretty serious denim stains on my seats lol
Get a dry towel and press as much moisture as you can out if they're that damp. Youre asking for mildew.
Thanks Chris Lifesaver =D
Can I use my regular home vacuum for this?
Thanks for the info and tutorial!
Why’d you need to spray the whole seat tho?
The 350 dislikes dont have a shop vac
Betting 20$ that must people in the developed world don't own shop vacs
Vacuum $45 Dish soap $2 Squirt bottle $2 Your time -priceless
You're not spraying water you're spraying "soapy water".
Shop vac cost me 70 bucks today
does this technique work on old stains as well?
Really cool and unique intro man keep up the good work
How much was your take out?
agitate it with a brush or micro fiber rag...You would clean that spot in 1 pass
Most people have a shop vac of some kind, a squirt bottle and some dawn dishwashing liquid. Thanks Chris! Great tip on how to clean cloth car seats! Unfortunately my shop vac is elsewhere ATM. But I will definitely give this a try when I get it back!
Your awesome!
That sound 😂😂😂
Wow...works great! Takes out dirt and grease.. Thank you!
Thanks!  Worked perfectly on some sort of chocolate stain I had!
Bad choice of words
Did a good job. But I can still see the ketchup stain
Or take glass cleaner and a rag spray area scrub with rag
Mix peroxide and some dawn and some baking soda. You can scrub with a brush and let it dry then vacuum or scrub and rinse with hot water spray and wet vac it up... gets the stains nothing else touches
The comments on this video are killing me! 🤣
Nice
Wow I like this video thanks for sharing 😊
Would scrubbing the stain help after spraying it?
Will this work on older stains?
Now you have sticky soap residue from the dish soap that will attract dirt.
Thank you so much, it works
It worked!
"Leave your windows open and let the sun do its job" Then it rains.
Could I use a regular vacuum?
Isopropyl alcohol sprayed on the seat, and rub it in.  Then use some paper towels to soak it out.  Works once or twice (not five times with a vac).  Alcohol costs about 98 cents.
I had cum stains all over my seats and this worked wonders very useful!
Getting on this right now. Picked up a seat from the junkyard for my lady's Malibu ystrdy and it's as bad as the one IN her car. LOL
What about mold and severe grease stains? Awesome video. Thanks so much.
This is helpful! Thanks.👍
Zero dollars? Where d you get a free shop vac? Where do you plug it in for free? Free dawn liquid? Free hot water? Where do you live?
I find a touch of heavy duty workshop degreaser in the spray bottle helps a lot.
soapy wooder? SOAPY WOODER?! good thing you definitely have a shopvac.
Problem is you now have soap in your seats which attract dirt.  You need to clean with plain water to get all the soap residue out.
brilliant!
Thx
Thank you
hi there, can i use any hoover ? i mean is it the same hoover that we use at home? is not going to damage the hoover taking the water out? thanks
Great video! Have you ever tried this method with a cleaner designed for car upholstery, like Meguiar's?
Why am I watching this, I have no car!
The sun?.... in the UK!.... even in summer!... bawhahahahahahahahahaha
Curious... should I try this on old stains with cold water and some detergent, versus the hot water? Thoughts? I always worry about setting stains... but, I guess they are old stains, how much more could I set them?
Rubbing with plastic brush, than vacuum.. and you don't need 4 second pass... He rub with sticks of vacuum cleaner...that Is sow stupid
Rubbing little... than yoy do not need second pass.... Jesus man!!!
spray bottle, dawn and the local car wash's vacuum should work too.Maybe not in all areas but in my area there are a few car washes with free vacuums! (And no, you don't have to use their car wash to use their vacs!!)
The absolute best way to clean cloth seats, is by never being a fucking cheap ass and get leather.
Amazing.
ok method.  I however us a soap mix or my upholstery spray - but scrub a bit with a damp brush.  Then use old rags to sop it up.
Do you have two filters for your shop vac? Do you use one for dry vacuuming and one for wet vacuuming. I don't know if I can use my husband's Shop-Vac for wet... Maybe if I buy him another filter?
Quick clean and easy
Awesome thanks 🙏
Bruh getting ppl with the click bait. Everything he used in this video cost money.water, dish soap, shop vac, spray bottle.
People do this? When my seat gets a little mark on it I just buy a new car.
Yeah... Too bad they don't put this good quality cloth in cars anymore.. Try this on the new cheap thin ass cardboard "sport fabric" cloth they put in cars these days and see how well it works!
I don't even mess around.  warm day with sun shining,  I take a water hose and moderately wet down,  spray carpet cleaner on it,  scrub,  and vac it up.   Done this for years with near perfect results.   I don't have time to spray and vacuum every seat 3 to 4 times.
The best thing I've seen for stains, even used this method on may sofa. Brilliant!!!!!
Lost me at the first step. Where do I acquire a shop vac
What a good trick !
im confused my dick got caught in ceiling fan
How about spraying the pot better the first time, take a hard brissel brush and scrub then vac
Water cost money dish soap also cost money so does the shop vac so does the bottle
"it's not gonna cost you a cent"  "okay so the first thing you're gonna need is your shop vac" WTF  EDIT: I wrote this three years ago, didn’t expect to be the top comment lol. y’all are really getting butthurt over this 😂
zero dollars:  First buy a shop vac.  wtf.
WOW , Just like magic ...
Nice
I still see it
How do you live without the ability to tap?
Zero dollars? I have to buy a spray bottle, dish soap, a shop vac, and a car if I want to do this!
does it work un suade car seats ? :)
muppet
thank you this helped me a lot because I just bought a junkyard seat from an 01 Camry and it was gross thanks so much for making this video
Thx a lot sir!!!
Is rather spend 7 bucks for something like blue magic
I used brush ..
👍
Hot water will set the protein in any contamination,that stain will be almost impossible to remove then.
Using Dawn,baking soda and peroxide as a paste for stains works wonders.
Works on the carpet too???
I need to buy a vacuum cleaner fuck it's not free
Ser you are brilliant!!  your videos are helpful and very much appreciate it. I'm hoping that you could probably help me.. I have many windows and they are  Louver windows ..my house gets very cold in the winter..  I try clear plastic with a frame and it's very hard for me to do that wondering if you may have any ideas ?? I would truly appreciate it thank you very much.
Yo- lol that’s a dank little tune playing! Shoutout to that dude! Great vid, man!
Yeah not pro at all. So much soap left in your seat. Your seat will be hard and even dirtier in a month.
Something that works really well and carpet cleaner meant for pet stains!!!
Nice job so yeah what if I don’t have that type of vaccum?
ONLY 4 OR 5 TIMES lmao. Use a nail brush with the water gun and that way you will only have to do it one's.. I dont allow eating or drinking in my car so this isnt a problem for me I dont even let my kids in the car that is what my wife is here for

I did it as he said! Very easy and good results!
I think is better to use laundry detergent because it is for fabric, not for dishes..
Thank you man . that was really good but i lost my vacuum , the water went inside the motor and make it die
shopvac? spraybottle? dawn?  we aren't all rich maaannnn
Hi Chris,  I'm planning on cleaning the seats my wife's honda the next time i'm at the the car wash. I like to know if I can use their public vacuum machine as I'm not sure if it would damage it with water getting all sucked up into the machine. let me know, thanks
i dont jave a fucking shop vac
How old was stain?  Would agitating it help on really old deep stains ???
Great process thanks.
Any other tips and tricks?? Joy hand cleaner??
Try spray 9 or purple power but rinse fast!!!???
Let the sun do its job...where I live the sun is as likely to appear as the tooth fairy 😗
This worked very well for me
Thank you
Great tip with the  J edger  :)
this was really helpful, i just wish my shop vac was stronger!
Great tip as usual Chris! Is that the Welland canal in the opening shots?
Scrub lightly w/soft brush also.
Don't forget to set up the shop vac for wet pickup!!  Great video, I have cloth seats and am looking forward to trying this.
Good tip, thanks Chris.  I now keep a small hand towel in the car and put this across my lap when ever I have to eat in the car.  Cheers, David.
No money, you say? I had to buy a shop vac and a spray bottle!
Nice !!
My suggestion is to begin using cold water for a few passes, then use hot water.  Hot water will set some stains. Learned this working for a dry cleaner.
Just happen to have cloth seats in my truck and yes the drivers side seat is stained. lol Will get on that. Cheers
