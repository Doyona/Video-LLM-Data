Thank u so... much. I love the way u explain.  Can i request u to make a video on Hyderabadi chicken birayani pls..
Everything s good. But it's nt right to use a plastic cup to pour boiling water. Teaching wrong thing to beginners.
B6
Please  talk less
Thanks for  u r  recipe  I really like it
Did you forget salt talking so much ??

I think m in a mathematics class lol😂😂😂😡😷
You didn't mention why is it very very important to soak the rice?
Long live India. I have spent my childhood in asam. Still some of my relatives in India. Love you mother india
nice
It should be cooked in medium heat or slow heat for 15 min?
very nice
जाया राम
Please talk less  It’s not time effective-
Free tip for people:- watch it in 2X playback speed.. it saves your time....
Talk is tooooooo more so pls stop more talking
Thank you so so so Much ! ,  You have have made everything so simple and so basic and so easy to follow along.
Nice nice nice
Useful tips, good explanation n awesome recipe  👍
Why are people criticising her for talking when she is explaining things in good detail to beginners.If you consider yourself an expert then don’t watch or comment or go make videos with less talking.
Anupama you are a genius. The way you explain how to make a dish is crystal clear and you just stick to the point. Good job. I usually watch recipes in you tube where the chef don't talk. But yours is amazing, just the way I need. Quick and clear. Keep going.
Dude why is she giving a lecture
Thankuu thankuu thankuu very much dear... Rice : Water  1 : 2.5
We also tried to make same veg pulao of sanjeev kapoor, and its taste was amazing
u did a great job. pls continue the good work
Plz make video in less time ee... It's sooo lagggg 🙄😏
guys she is not talking more..she is trying her best to help you beginners not to go wrong in any step
Tooo much talking
thank you so much. you have a way of explaining nicely. THANKS A LOT.
loved the way you explain... its the first time i made fried rice after seeing your recipe and it tastes Soo yummy...
Love your explanation .... Thankyou...♡♡♡
Ketna bak bak krte
watter. depan. on. rice
Water ratio totally riuned it. My came out all soggy. Guys don't put as much water as she has adviced. It's a lot of water.
Thank you that is very nice but why is it important to soak the water for 20 min? You said it was important but did not mention why. Also adding hot water - why not cold water and let it boil?
aare baap re chapar chapar band kar
kitni baat karti he
MashaAllah very nice with simple and short speech delicious healthy pulao .
You talking too much
someone shut her mouth!!!!!
Wow............😍
nice

very helpful suggestions thanks
Very good love this recipe
Nice recipe but you didn't added chillies, Doesn't it require?
Anupana is my fav chef as she turned  me  perfect at cooking following her recepies and perfect measurements ..
This is great...but I have tried this along with this link  https://youtu.be/f3DhdeaVZBQ
Too much  bak bak yar👹
Guys, for all those who say she's talking too much for a simple recipe, pls note well that she told at the beginning it's for "Beginners". For those who don't know anything about kitchen, this is what they need. Recipes u can get from anywhere but such steps u can't find...
Dish is very nice but u talk too much=-O
Very nice thanks
very tasty..
Thanks dear
Kya baat hai kanna to aaj me hi banaugi garme sab kuch hogayge yes....
I must say that for me this is indeed a recipe that never fails. Thank you for sharing! :)
Nicely explained. We need to remember this is for beginners. But I think this is too much of water for soaked basmati rice.
is it 2.5 cups water for 1 cup rice??? that too basmati rice...after soaking  it for 20 mins??? are you sure? does it not become a paste?
Too much lecture....  She should speak less....  Recipe is nice but the chef is behaving like lecturer...
Paulao should be taken with??
She is better than Sanjeev Kapoor on explanations, tips and suggestions. Thanks for the Video. Nice Pulao
https://youtu.be/HNfAhnCWkV8

Too much of talking is disturbing. Not able to focus on the recipe .In a visual medium, no need to talk so much, everything is visible .Unnecessary repetition.
I will try this recipe
Nice recipe but I believe the rice has to be measured before soaking it.. Correct me if I am wrong. 😊
wow I'm very enjoyed it because you explain Nicely and very clearly :-) I love it :'*
Thank u for all the recipe I really love it
talk less, show more !

Hydra addis
i like to watch all your vedios because you explain very nicely and clearly which helps me to cook the receipes of yours.
what the hell. no chillis no ginger no garlic.... will it be edible?
thnku nicely explained
perfect
Recipe should be in short. Not necessary to talk to much,its time wasting.
Nicely explained. I exactly followed the steps and made stunning Pulao. As aptly mentioned by her, it made me feel proud since everyone enjoyed it :) Thank you! And viewers please watch carefully, she absolutely added salt.
Its just amazing...my mom had learnt a lot of things from it....its really helpful......
thank you ...
madam you forgot to add salt i think first learn to cook then teach others
What abt mint &/ corriander?...its important in simple pulao too...or am i wrong?
All sanjeev kapoor videos and they assistance videos boring one ,specially they used spicies and ingredients  which is not avaible near by stores. After seeing they videos I can say one thing charaaney kay bandhar ko ek rupiya ka karcha. My advice to Mr. Sanjeev kapoor make it simple which is easy for common people dont make complicated means ur videos are suites for those who work in big hotels.
Hb
She added salt .Yes while adding rice
Wher id salt
OMG she talks too much.
She forgot to put salt i think
Thanks we try to make it ...looks yummy
dude were is the salt?!!!
u forgot to add salt
I made it just the way you said and it is very delicious...... :)
Hi sanjeev ji apki sab recipes dekhti ho  jo muhjhey pasand bhi atey hai mera prash yeh hai ki sabji me haldi ka amount kese aur ketna dalna chahiye ta ki us ka rang sundar aye mere sabji ka rang sundar nahi ata hai dhanyavan

plz say the reason of using boiled water while cooking rice?
bakwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
R.I.P. English. Please check the English subtitles.
Same ind n method but try cooking dhall kitcheri.healty n. delicious...yummmmy  .
I think it's a plastic measurement which u used to add the hot boiling water and this is very bad for health. Otherwise good recipe.
There is no pulao powder that has been used. I actually have a pulao powder with me and now I have no clue where should it be used.
Can you please tell me what kind of Biryani Rice do you use? I have tried Tilda, Kohinoor and Royal. But neither one has such a long grain. Thank You!
Perfect! Thank you. I had guests coming and I didn't know what to do with rice.  Everyone enjoyed it so much.  I will use this recipe again.
Thank you for your clear directions and explanations! ..the pulao came out delish. Simple, basic, and delish. Added some chopped up green chillies to give it a slight kick and used whatever veggies I had. I didn't have the zeera-like ingredient. Will use it next time to see how the taste differs. I will surely be making this again and again.
I tried it and came out well.thank you very much for this video.its a good dish to cook
Oh my god you guys make simple pulao without chilies.. how to eat it man..
Hello My rice got sticked to the bottom. I took 1 cup of rice and followed ur instructions. Just was not sure for hw mny mins to cook. Cn u just tell me what would hv gone wrong.  Awaiting for ur reply.  Thank u for the recipe
Hi Sanjeev, Thanks for uploading such great recipes.  Don't we add any spice in pulao like haldi, dhaniya power.. Please clarify me?
I have made it and am proud of this...Thank you...
Salli recipe kam or apna fuddu bhasan jyada maar rh hai
those aren't carrots.  they are tomatoes.  love how she says "beginners"  she says " beg an urs."
tried it...really great...
The food looks delicious and so does the pretty cook!!!:):):):)
thank you
lovely and tasty Sir. Thank you
Hi anupama.  If we cook in pressure cooker, then how many whistle should i take for the rice to get cooked ? Please reply,.  Thank u !
Thk u, hw many whistles shuld I gv pls1

For this vegetable pulao can we usegeneral rice?????

Weight loss programs desperately want as many individuals as possible to to try their new products to demonstrate that they really help people lose weight. Well I discovered a website that will send free test products to your home, its the best way to get free diet supplements :) Paste this in your browser bit.ly/11CjTRK?v=dmyzt
Hello Sir! just wntd to knw if the ratio wuld remain the same if mkg it in cooker i.e 1:21/2 for veg pulao. Thks!
after a lot of mess i finally made a nice pulao... its just awesome n very simple... thank u sooooo  much for the valuable suggestions and steps.... :)
very nice thank q
As chef Harpal Sing Sokhiji says, Made in a jiffy and gone in a giffy. Will try out tdae.   And, please please be a bit solw wen u xplain.   Thank u !
You explain very well.  Please continue cooking more Indian recipes. God bless! .
its very easy thank u mam.....:)
pls reduce ur speed....say slowly
My god...i feel sleepy when she is explaining like that.....could have been precise...God for everything she is explaining in a lengthy way....:(
Almost ready, already looks great !!!
it's too easy i will try this
i tried this but dint turn out good :(
Tried it, and it turned out so good. Thank you for providing all minute details and an explanation for why to do things in certain way. I would like to try the same recipe using brown recipe. Do I need to soak rice for 2-3 hrs? What would be the rice and water ratio? Please advise.
I luv da way u talk Anupa
very  very  nice
I don't understand, at this level how can chef don't bother to tied up their hairs. It's a matter of food and hygiene.
Talks a lot , I lost interest watching such a long vedio. It should be kept simple and short. Receipe takes much lesser time than she talks. Zaya is better host. Try to keep it short and simple.
she explains like a teacher explains with a stick in her hand with some arrogant tone.... sanjay thumma is way better in presenting himself....
very bad recipe i tried this,,,disgusting explanation\
I would like to try cooking this for dinner. The only thing is I have always cooked rice on a 1:1 ration on high heat until the water boils then covered it on low heat for 15 minutes, then turned the stove off and let it sit for another 15 minutes. Making sure  not to lift the lid during the entire process. Can you please suggest if I should change that method. Thanks.
I really appreciate the way you explain the intricate details of why each step is important and their importance.  I followed your strips and I made a good vegetable pulav. I am loving it and feeling accomplished :)   Thanks
very nice ,I just want to comment that ,since you started for new  comers can you tell serving size it will help them.
Thank you for this tutorial. Why is shahi zeera preferred over ordinary zeera  - any special reason for this preference ?
Hi Anupa  Thank you for easy recipe rather than using boiling water from pot why don't you use electric kettle that will be easier for you......
i love indian food
