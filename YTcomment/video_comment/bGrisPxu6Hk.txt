Love this screen printing hack! What design would you guys make on your DIY silk screen?
are you kidding me? thank you so so much for sharing this
This is by far the most accessible and affordable DIY screen printing method I've seen on here!🖤✨️
What's the name of the white paint
whaaaaat .I went to a class yeasterday and we used expensive materials.I loved it thank you guys
Great!!!  I enjoyed this.
Great idea! I'll be trying this out for my homeschool art class.
You guys are geniuses! All the other videos, I'd need a bunch of stuff I don't have... Yours, I have everything but the paint already at home 😍 Thank you!
What is decoupage medium? Sorry, my first language is nog English. Might you have a brand name or maybe another name...?
Great idea with the hoops BUT I would use something like an old sheer curtain instead of the panty-hose. The panty-hose is too stretchy and, as you make your pass with the scraper, the material gives just enough to introduce a blur. I like the hoop idea though. Easy to change graphics and they are re-useable (the graphics, that is). Just re-stretch them onto the hoop.
Hi! Fellas will this work for polymer clay? Thank you 😊
This is so cool. Thank you. Subbed!
What are the materials needed?
Love this! It’s super helpful. Thank you! :)👍🏽
LOVE!!!! SOOOOOO Smart!!!!! Thank you so much for sharing! 🥰
do you think i could use clear spray paint instead of decopodge?
Wait... are you guys not really lumber Jack's?
Can I use regular glue?
What kind of embroidery hoop is better wood or plastic.which one you recommend
Thanks really cute.
cool
This is really smart!
Do you seal the paint with anything?
What’s the white paint called please
I just wanna say you helped me, it's worthy..
this video was super helpful! i’ve been looking to print a couple of tshirts and this is the first tutorial that’s not super expensive. thank you!
Love it, easy breezy.
LOL your reaction when you lifted the first layer was iconic af. 🤣
2 gays see penis aaahhhhhh
Apne mesh k liye konsa kpada liya hai...
What paint do you use .?
GREAT hack! thank you!! What do you mean by "decoupage medium?"  I'm not sure what that is.  Thanks
I'm going to try it this way first to show my daughter and granddaughters before making a big screen!
Are you saying Deco parge medium? Haha! I need to get some of that white stuff you paint on the screen to create the stencil.
Our closet XD
how to wash the screen?
Hell yes, this is what I'm talking about. Guerilla silk screen tactics.
Pls list out the materials for me
on a scale of 1/10 how poor are you...   pantyhose
Which is the meterial used
Thank you so much I really appreciate this and I'm headed to the art store right now lol
This is the most hipster screen printing video ever. Trash.   “I have a piece of cork board we had but never used.” Weird  And y’all waited for panty hose, which o believe really was in yout closet, to dry, but stated that regular screen printing is a “lengthy” process. Ok  Lazy millennials
Great idea
Will that work for silk screening tje foldable fan?
Cool!
Screen printing seekhne ke liye m tech channel bahot achha hai
NO
Cute! Would be a really cute way to display an enamel pin collection!
I like your video even I try to screen print like you .but you really amazing
You guys are way tooooo Cute :)
Thank you so much! I can't wait to try it.
Something with skulls definitely. This looks great!
Yayyyyyyyy.  Straight forward instructions on how to make and use. Thank you guys x
Fun fun thanks guys i will try witj my son x
reactions are priceless XD
Awesome!  Had no idea this could be done.  Thanks for sharing!
can u do this on t shirts too?
That's not screen printing. That Masking and painting
What is the membrane material that you have used?
Wondering if i can pay you guys for a screen and materials let me know please !
Hi are you able to make a clip using a racer back top and what type of fabric waterproof paint would i need?  am heading to make 100 tops for my Zumba club i have the template ready on paper just need to print on tops can you advise?
Cute couple.
Nice.. i wouldn't ever thought about this!
what is a cloth name
... Haven't y'all heard of SHMOXD???
if you tape foam to the sides it off sets the screen print so it doesn’t bleed through as much
Thanks for showing a "doable " way of silk screen printing at home.  I did it professionally for years and I can tell you that your presentation was awesome! Can't wait to try it.
Lol, Dave reminds me of Jackson from the Gilmore Girls!
You guys are the best 😍😍😍thank you so much.
Great hack!
better than panty hose is sheer curtain fabric. its not stretchy, so theres no way you can make the holes in your screen too big. you can always find curtains for super cheap at the thrift store and you get way more square feet for your money
That came out really nice... I’ve been wanting to screen print for a while. Awesome DIY
That was amazing do u guys do diy screen printing for T-shirt or can u a video for that one day
How do you wash it?
Hello I want to ask which type of deco polish medium to use? Thanks.
How did you guys wash it?
4:55 Chuck Norris
Love love this idea!!! ❤❤❤
OMG .. Brilliant! I Love You Guys!
What brand of decopauge did you use?
Going to use this idea for Mother’s Day, thanks so much for video
Simple but also difficult
Do you use the medium I'm the actual letter as well or just around the letters ?
Ok I actually love this though!!!
I  can't wait to try this
LOVE IT! COOLIO!
So dishwasher safe mod podge?
Excellent! I vaguely recall doing screen printing last century (I am old) and I think we used a paper stencil on it? I really like the idea of using the decoupage medium on it.
I loved this! You've made silk screening easy and attainable for us crafty novices. Well done guys! Always glad to see your product.  :-)
I screen printed a few times, and that "Ahhhhhhh" moment when it works is amazing! (And then those moments when the ink smears or doesn't penetrate the screen remind me why I've only done it a few times.)
how are you guys this cute?!?!?!?!? Amazing project, will try it soon
Awesome, guys 🎉
Really great idea. Tfs.
Thank you for sharing this neat idea guys!   I made a giant paw print for a t-shirt.   I used to work in retail and it was amusing when guys came to the store to pick up female products for their girlfriend, mom, wife or sister, they would be embarrased, not sure why.
Dose mod podge work?
I want to try that! Very fun idea. I look forward to videos from the Crafty Lumberjacks. Always great crafts that are affordable!
Could you possibly do this on fabric? But instead of acrylic use fabric paint? ✌
If you are feeling brave they also sell basic at home screen printing kits at places like Michael's. If you notice holes in the screen printing fluid after it's dry you can cover them with clear tape. They even make fluid that sets in sunlight for a fun summer T-shirt project that you can even do with kids.
I would love to see a montage of viewer's attempts at this craft. That would be cool. +
Great hack. Lots cheaper to play with than a screen setup I have looked at. Thank you. Aline's OK to Wash It may a better glue when you need to wash the screens instead of Mod Podge.
Great idea...
am I the only one who thinks that PAINTING is faster, easier and CHEAPER?
Great hack!!
Perhaps I am just inept in crafts but wouldn't it be easier/faster to just paint right on the surface? 😕
I'm definitely trying this.  That was great fellows!  Thanks!
I didn't know Zacky Vengeance works at HGTV handmade 😂😂😂😂😝
Wouldn't it have been easier to just write it on the board? :D
So cool!!😊
Those are cool! you two crack me up!
Can u reuse the screen print after its removed from the hoop n put back on??  Love your idea
I knew it before... From 5min crafts... 😑😑😑😑
This is amazing! Finally An Eastpak and inexpesive way to make a stencil
How cool is that......
WOW!!!!
That is so awesome! I can't wait to try this!
That's awesome! I have to try this!
Love this screen printing hack! What design would you guys make on your DIY silk screen?
