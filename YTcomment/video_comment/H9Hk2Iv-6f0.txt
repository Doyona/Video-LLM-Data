I made this Good Friday morning and it was an absolute winner. My not so gluten free family enjoyed it!
Sorry, when do you add in yeast? Confused
It might be because it’s late at night however do you put the yeast mixture with the psyllium husk or separate. I couldn’t see what you did with the yeast mixture. Thanks
Thank you Nicole
Thank you Jamie ❤️
Hallo, link http://fourspoonsglutenfreerecipes.com/ is lost...??? Can you help me? Because her recipes looks soooo good!
Too heavy ,  don’t like, think they perhaps don’t need as much psyllium gum,😫😫😫😫a waist of time and money😢😢😢😢😢
Any chance you could explain how hot the oven is when it's just the water in it? Many thanks for what looks like a very yummy recipe, we have two coeliacs in our household and really appreciate being able to still enjoy treats like this, your video is also very easy to follow with great music 😊
Lovely recipe... I didn't have psyllium husk, so I used a tad more xanthum gum and a bit of self-raising flour. It worked a treat! The hunt continues for a good gluten free recipe that doesn't use gums (those with intolerance to gluten often are intolerant to these gums as well).
Can we get written recipes with the video please
Just made these, but without the cross because I was too lazy. Really delicious and easy to make.
where did you go Nicole? your website is down...
I just made these and they turned out a TREAT! even though i subbed a lot as i didn't have much in the house; I used flax eggs instead of eggs and I didn't have psyllium husk so i used ground  chia - I also used a gluten free bread flour. But honestly, if they tasted this good when I wasn't even using the proper ingredients, who know how glorious they'd taste if you did them properly?!
She's cute and this is cool
My Mouth Is Watering! Can't Wait To Try These :)
very well explained
It has recently been advised that I should follow a low FODMAP diet which includes removing wheat from my diet, so this recipe is great (minus the dried fruit) as I LOVE hot cross buns. However, as a student I am struggling with the cost of buying these foods/ingredients. Have you got any advice on where or how to buy these ingredients as cheaply as possible?
There is nothing wrong with gluten, unless you are in the 1% of the population that has celiac disease. The guy who wrote "wheat belly" which was popularized by celebrities, based his "science" on unreproducable research from the 1960s and 70s. Also, he himself is overweight.
Thank yo so much! These are delicious! Happy Easter!
Your make me hungry come on its fucking easter
More gluten free please! Thanks!!
what's up with the gluten free stuff?
i enjoyed the recipe but i was looking at your amazing teeth the whole time, someones been flossing :)
Oh woow! Eccezionale! :)
Is it possible to replace the eggs in this recipe to make it vegan as well?
she took the pan out of the oven with her bare hands haha
Is it ok to store dry yeast like this? We always buy ones in little sachets (to make bread in the breadmaker) and my mum tells me to use however much I need and then throw away what's left if the sachet bc it'll lose its power if not in a vacuum packaging.
OMG I just made these and they are so yummy. they taste like normal ones with out the "OMG I'm going be sick" feeling. You have just made my Easter. <3
Is there an alternative to tapioca starch. Tapioca starch is really bad for you.
Ooo, thank you!  These look delicious - and I love that the flour mix doesn't require six million different ingredients.  Bonus points for dairy free - so many people who can't tolerate gluten can't tolerate casein either.  Extra thanks! :)
--my anaconda want some of them hot cross buns! oh my god, look at how hungry i am..
What is a gluten?
I have Celiac Disease. So I get very sick if I eat gluten. These videos really help. Thanks! :)
Thanks for this Nicole. I'm glad you're actually doing this for all the right reasons (helping people with gluten-intolerance) rather than as some deranged healthfood fad.
Is this lovely being Canadian? I'm trying to place the accent and I'm not quite sure.  Wonderful hot buns. ;)
she's like a cross of Anna Kendrick and Taylor Swift
Oh Nicole, these look amazing!!! So looking forward to trying these hopefully this weekend. :) thank you for all you do!
i'm definitely going to have to try these. i love her as a host too. so glad this video led me to her website!! i love watching foodtube anyways, even if i can't eat the food in most videos, but i'm so thankful you guys are incorporating more allergy friendly recipes!
Hooray! I miss hot cross buns. Will have to give these a try!
My recipe       1)go to your local store 2)find the bread isle 3)pick up some hotcrossbuns 4)buy them 5)go home 6)eat them 7)say fuck that vid
Wow, I will surely try these delish looking cross buns this weekend, thanks for sharing!
they look good
can I use flax meal instead of pysllium husk?
Gluten free !
hat is AllSpice ? 2:33
What is this "gluten free" stuff, why does it exist and why does it get supported?
looks delish and tempting !! btw, she's adorable
Stopped watching when she said gluten free. That stupid fashion of eating gluten free even tho your not gluten intolerant.. Sigh..
Delish!
OMG how exciting to see such delicious looking gluten-free baked goods. I can't wait to try this! (Also subbed to your channel.)
I really think that YT (and this channel in particular since it's dear to my heart and has made me discover amazing hosts) is doing such a wonderful thing for allergic/intolerant people by sharing awesome contents like this one. I am neither but I feel for those who are and have many friends who suffer from intolerances and this channel is very helpful and rich in suggestions and inspirations. So thank you to all the members and crew of Food Tube!
good job they look great
The girl looks kind of like Taylor Swift hihi 🙈
Conkers
Annoying shaking camera.
Love me a Cutie  with nice Buns
Are these like bread or more towards some sort of cake?
I have a gluten free flour blend in my cupboard, would that work in place of the tapioca starch and brown rice flour? And does anyone in the UK have a tip for somewhere cheapish to get the psyllium husk? I looked on Holland and Barrett and it's rather pricey! Thanks for the recipe, it's my first gluten free Easter and I miss hot cross buns so much!
hello    thank you for your directions on hot cross buns.   can you please tell me about the gram weight per bun, before you placed the on the pan.  thanks  marg
This is so helpful for people with things like arthritis or muscle spasms that can't knead for a long time, aside from being celiac friendly. Thanks to Nicole and FoodTube!
soy is much worse than gluten
For the longest time I thought hot cross buns were only from the song and didn't know what they were.
fuck off with your gluten free
be any more attractive?!
Just subscribed to her channel. I'm always in search for new gluten free recipes as someone with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (doctor diagnosed, mind you). Those buns look delicious and I can't wait to see more recipes on your channel!
Omgness I love her energy she's fantastic!
So glad to see you guys posting some GF recipes. I was diagnosed a few weeks ago and it has been the most frustrating transition. Will definitely try these!
What is the difference between currants & raisins? Or is it the same thing?
My best friend just found out she is coeliac so will be sending this to her! Thanks so much :) it's so difficult for her to substitute the foods she loves! Sorry to see all the comments assuming you're making them gluten-free to jump on the gluten-free trend..people seem to forget there are plenty of people in the world who actually can't eat gluten ;)
Oh my gosh, those looked so fluffy and soft and squshy!  I wanted one!  I've never really seen a hot cross bun before!  I have just played the song on my plastic flutafone when I was in grade school!  If I wasn't making that pasta recipe I would so try this!!!
absolutely fantastic, I've missed hot cross buns since I've developed an allergy to wheat  ... thank you thank you thank you
Yummy
Hi guys it's Nicole
Swear flour has gluten in it and she's using it on the surface… surely they aren't gluten free
Subscribed to you now Four Spoons :)
That is a big orange.... or she has very small hands :))
Can I make these with flour? And, you know... just knead it as I do most things with flour?
Looks delicious! :D
How is it gluten free if you're using flour near the end?
I liiikee her!
Would love to try them! Any ideas on what would be a good substitue for eggs to make them vegan?
Everytime I hear the phrase gluten-free I get alergic.
They look good, but I wish she gave equivalent measurements if you don't need them to be gluten free.
Why not just use gluten free flour...? O_o
why do gluten free? i don't understand
How could I replace psyllium husk? Thanks
I like her buns.. I mean not hers, but.. Oh never mind...            P.s. lovely smile! Just like mines.. :DD
___|___ cross
they are fucking disgusting they only look good for some reason it made me click on this video
She reminds me of Kiele Sanchez.
Doesn't flour have gluten cause u roll the dough out with flour
sorted just did this !!
They look really good.
Oh gosh, i'm totally in love for this girl, wow !
5:36 - No Gloves? I bet those burns are still hurting  Kiddings aside, looks delicious, looking forward to making them home :)
traditional ..Where? Sorry, but I've never seen them before, They look tasty anyway:D
Super positive lady! :)
I stopped after "Gluten Free"
glutenfreglutenfreeglutenfree wtf is up with every1
how can she use grams (of water) in one step, and a minute later ml (of water) ?????
Why is gluten free so popular now? Gluten is't bad, unless you have gluten allergy
sry lady, but i have to give this one to the guys at sortedfood, just like the fact that they dont substitute stuff with something half chemical-like or so, and they have bunnies!
they look delicious!!I am craving some right now lol,Love your enthusiasm=) x
Can't call a gluten free hot cross bun a traditional recipe!
*insert salivation here*
Hell yeah, I love that
can u make these vegan?
I've never heard or seen this before... So any reason I wouldn't be able to change the water for milk?
She's just so pleasant to listen to :)
No gluten but you roll it up in flower?
This is sooooooo cool thx for this ill try them
I personally think that this recipe is good, but cross bunNIES are better. Am I right? #sortedfood
but my anaconda wants bigger buns :(((
Can you use chocolate instead of raisins? :)
