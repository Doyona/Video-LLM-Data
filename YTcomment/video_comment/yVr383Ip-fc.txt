I cook with eggs but I do not like eggs on their own. I hate fried eggs and haven't eaten one in over a decade.
You had me at Fried Rice. ;)
Hi! This is my go-to recipe for Nasi Goreng:  The herb paste: 3-4pcs of candlenuts (or macademia nuts) Shallots  Garlic 1-2tbsp dried shrimp Thai chilies as much as you can take  Blend them all together and fry them every time you wanna make nasi goreng.   As for the seasoning, condiments and all you can follow Pai's recipe :)
This woman rocks 😊
I'm Indonesian. The only differences for me, I would add some powder beef bouillon and use fresh Thai chilies instead of the jar sambal oelek. That is because the jar sambal oelek has vinegar in it which Indonesian do not normally use vinaigrette chilies for fried rice. I also use about two tablespoons of blue band margarine instead of oil and I don't use fish sauce. Everything else is the same.
Sawadee Ka Pai Colin has just cooked Nasi Goreng and it was lovely and probably better than our local Chinese takeaway 👍👍🌟 Colin 🇬🇧
As an Indonesian, I was expecting that your "Indonesian Fried Rice" will differ at least a little bit with mine. Because you are a Thai person. But at the end, I have to say that you really made an authentic Indonesian Fried Rice. You also explain clearly the use of each ingredient.  Hats off to you!     👍
If it is nasi goreng, the belachan is in my opinion non negotiable. The smell is funky but sooooooo gooood. Glad you added achar as condiment along with the fried shallots. They are absolutely great at completing the dish. In Singapore and Malaysia, the achar will be a spicy sort and we tend to also include red or green chilis with the nasi.
You need chives
Beh-La-Chan
I like to make my nasi goreng with ikan teri(nasi), the very small one Anchovy, I fry them first in coconut oil until crispy, set aside. In that same oil you fry the rest of the nasi goreng. the bumbu and the rice. I love to put patai too ( = sator beans) . To sweeten it up I also use a spoon of abon sapi. Enak sekali.
Where did you go to culinary school?
Hello Pai. My mom used to put spam in her nasi goreng. Spam???  If you haven't tried it, you should. It is amazing!! Andre from Vancouver
I like shredded omelette on top of nasi goreng instead of sunny side up egg
Quick tip: Make the sambal yourself. I've tried making it with sambal oelek but the taste is not right at all. It's more of a condiment. It made the weirdest nasi goreng i've ever had. Just make a paste out of red chilis, shallots and garlic, add some salt and brown sugar (+ lemongrass if you have it). That sambal will give the right type of taste and spice to nasi goreng.
I have Chinese shrimp paste, but that one is heavily salted. Is that something that can be used, too?
I think if I' get a late night craving, I might make this. I have everything but the shrimp crackers (or day old / cold rice, but I know a trick for that.) Haven't had nasi goreng in a while. Although, I have been watching this video with subtitles on, which YouTube generates, and when you said "kecap manis" it came on the screen as "ketchup mayonnaise." You said you can add anything to nasi goreng; I would submit that ketchup and mayonnaise are not appropriate. Eww. :)
What type of rice is used?  basmati rice?
FYI: the shrimp crackers can be made in microwave without any oil!!
my grandfather was born in Jakarta so i kinda grew up with this dish. i remember mom used to put some green peas in it, maby that's the European touch ;-)
If you can't find kecap manis, just use ketchup. The color will be different, but it's still good👍
Mmmmm ketchup mayonnaise!
Shrimp paste! Should be banned in apartments lol
I make a version of nasi goereng which I guess isn't very traditional but I love it. I do it by making the rice in a large pot and frying chicken, peas, red, green and yellow peppers as well as green onions in another pan. I use sweet soya sauce, sambal and quite a bit of cumin and just put  everything in with the rice and stir when the rice is cooked.  It's served with pineapple slices and a home made peanut sauce.
same like I did in Indonesia.
Which grocery markets carry those Shrimp crackers here in US?
I love how generous you are with the fried shallots :)
Hello Ms. Pailin, I'm addicted to a lot of your wonderful recipes, even though your unique gift to communicate makes hearing and watching your videos a pleasure in and by themselves. Congratulations, again and again. Thank you too, this time, for your take of nasi goreng belacan (เบลัฉาน), which is one of my all time favorite dishes.
Thai and Indonesian cuisines share a lot of ingredients, except cilantro or coriander leaves. I don't know why it's uncommon in Indonesia even though coriander seeds are a pretty fundamental and commonly used spice in Indonesian cooking.
Waah asik enak bgt terima kasih mba saya jg org indo mantep bgt poko nya 👍👍👍👍👍😋😋😋😋
I tried Indonesian food for the first time last week in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and wow how flavorful was the food. Since then, I have been watching every single indonesian recipe on youtube. Those who has never tried Indonesian food before, try this recipe, you will love it.
My Oma would put cabbage in her Nasi Goreng. I love this!! Thanks for sharing.
I just cooked this dish earlier. Quick tip: if you cant get a hold of shrimp paste, or if you just dont like the funky smell of it, you can use a shrimp broth cube instead. I use the Knorr brand. It's sooo good. gives u that umami flavor just as well.
I really enjoy your channel-- very authentic recipe.  Unless you cook with shrimp paste often, be careful,  if  you use terasi or belecan  in your mortar/pestle (ulekan/cobek) , it will forever retain the fragrance of terasi....beware!  It's better to sauté the paste with shallot and garlic in oil.
Shrimp paste in burmese is called "Ngapi"
Thank you Pailin for promoting our cuisine. One more ingredient you shall put is candle nut with the paste. Way to go Pailin! Love your channel and I love Thai food too.
You can add stinky bean call Petai, that's make perfect when u cook NASI GORENG
where did u get that mortor?
I’m in love with your channel. you teach all my favorite recipes in a very easy way. Brazilian kisses from Dubai! 🥰
I might not agree with all the ingredients involved but the way you have presented in this video is so delightful. Great job!
Hi, when in Indonesia as a kid I remembered getting peanuts on the fried egg and rice, mm good, they were probably fresh roasted Spanish peanuts
Indonesian good always delicious 😋
That nasi goreng not cooked yet. No steam coming from the rice. Or is it my eyes?
This recipe looks so tasty.  Thank you for sharing friend.  Stay connected!
We also usually use ketchup and chilli sauce in the nasi goreng
Indonesian fried rice is the best
you can trying also make Soto  Indonesian food.
my preference when eating nasi goreng are with egg (not the sunny side), bitter bean (petai), hot sauce
"ABC kicap" will never let you down
She's so beautiful. Oh my God. The perfect creation. How God made perfect beautiful women like this. I fell in love. she should be my wife. I love you Pai ❤️❤️💖💗💝
Thank you Pailin for making an amazing presentation and preparation of our Indonesian national dish. It is really authentic and is prepared exactly the way we do it. Some people also add a fried chicken and chicken satay on the side. Additionally the acar may be mixed with shallots and bird eye chillis. Also plus sambal terasi on the side.
i don't have shrimp paste is this 100% necessary into this nasi-gorang ? plz tell me I'm going to make it
Great recipe !  Introducing another mouth watering recipe from India's southern state,  Kerala,  The Kerala Style Coconut Rice  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp0z-IEEcuA&t=20s
Made this yesterday and it was so delicious!
Nice and healthy platter.
try adding (salted) anchovy and some stinking beans (petai). no nasi goreng tastes better
If you don’t have shrimp paste could you use anchovy paste in a smaller amt?
Hi Pallin, I like Nasi Goreng with stink beans and real Indonesian peanut sause. I'm from the Netherlands, so we used to eat Indonesian food from the day that we are kids...Kroepoek and peanut sause are so normal for us Dutchies ;)
wow this is very authentic! im sure it taste so great look at the amount of shrimp taste you put i think that very strong lol! ABC sweet soya sauce is very sweet i think you may use it lesser and use fresh chili instead ready made one then it will be perfect!
I like mine with sour green mangoes
Well it's really similar to south indian food!
Yessss. enak!
Shrimp paste in Indonesia is calling " Terasi, but in Malay is Belacan
Its amazing Pai, am indonesian and this is exactly how i cook my Nasi goreng ❤️🤤🇮🇩 thank youuuuuuu x
I love how on point is your pronounciation of 'krupuk' and 'terasi'.   Love from Indonesia ❤️
I'm Indonesian and now I live in Bangkok, what a perfect youtube content for me. You are more talented to cook nasi goreng than Indonesian 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Hi love from Indonesia. Good job 😁
wow..delicious😋😋😋
I like Indonesian food , i like if you make (Dry meat ) it it crunchy salt , i do not know the name , may be dindin ,normally it is in Indonesian restaurants
I like your cocking , i am from Saudi Arabia, i like you make Saudi dish very traditional (Kabsa) very nice and popular too
Best time of the year to cook Nasi Goreng!
My favorite Nasi Goreng comes with prawn crackers, beef satay skewer, fried chicken 🍗, grilled prawns, pickled salad, tomatoes 🦐,  fried egg 🍳 and the rice is topped with caramelized fried onions. Yum, yum, yum! 😋 Thanks Pailin for showing us how to cook this delicious recipe.😉🙏
needs kefir lime in the paste
If anyone whose first language is not English, please note: Pailin uses a mispronunciation of the word "herb" that some Americans mistakenly use, where they drop the aspirate from the start, so when you hear her say "urb" she really means "herb".
Hi Paulin, love your short hair. The taste of fresh Thai chilli (lombok jempling) will give more 'kick' to the end, not sambal oelek. We usually warm up the fish crackers on the sun(or microwave for second) before Fry it, to make it crunchier and expand larger. Love your channel ❤️😍
For our Malaysian nasi goreng kampung... kampung in english is village 😁 we pound the garlic & the red onion & cili padi with anchovies...also belacan....fry it..the veges can use water spinach or sayur kangkung in malay....😁 yummy....😋
I like KECAP BANGO better than ABC🤣😋❤️
WHERE THE SALT
Thank you for reminding me of this dish.  When I was in Indonesia, I would try Nasi goreng where ever I went.  Now I will make it myself thanks to your video.
I'd like to use kencur (kaempferia galanga), pete (stinky bean), julienne slices of kefir lime leaves (without midrib or leaf bone and petiole), and green chilli for my  nasi goreng. It feel so aromatic, and delicious. I don't use fish sauce for indonesian nasi goreng kampung, it is for chinese style fried rice. But anyway, nice recipe, thanks.
Love the way you cook the nasi goreng. I blend dried chillies sub for sambal oelek. And also I added salted fish cut in small pieces. Omg. So yummmm! Oh yaaa less the salt too if u add salted fish. Looking forward for more asian dishes!
This looks delicious, I like to have raw beansprouts with nasi goreng :)
Dia ga tau kalo setiap daerah rasa dan bumbu nasi goreng beda-beda 😁
The one at the mani catholic club is the best
Love the way your forehead wrinkles when it tastes good.
Nice plating..thank you for promote indonesian food mom
Whether it's "belacan" or "terasi" depends on the locale. Javanese people call it "terasi", but on the Sumatera island, "belacan" is more common.
That's how I like my fried egg cooked. I'll be so sad if it's well done.
I really like your version of Nasi Goreng!!!! Great video....Thanks.
A good replacement for shrimp paste is dried anchovies
i like nasi goreng with seafood in it
looks yummy. fried shallot is my fav. i used to apply at any food or meals
❤❤❤❤❤
Yes you are totally correct Pai. The most important ingredients from Nasi Goreng is Kecap Manis. The second one is one day before rice. Do not use fresh cooked rice.
U cant find cilantro?
Thanks. Make video disc and sell to people interesed in this lesson
Thank you for appreciating Indonesian food. I love Thai food, too: Tom Yam Kung, Pad Thai, the curries, mango sticky rice, etc. Hope you explore more Indonesian food such as rendang, sop buntut (oxtail soup), soto, sate, gulai (curries), the peanut sauce for gado gado/karedok/pecel, etc. Good luck with you, Pai!
Hi Pailin, thank you for the video. I have been meaning to give you some advice on Krupuk. When you are frying it,  not too much oil and as you are cooking it,  press it and shake little bit against the pan with spatula as the krupuk will expand a lot more!  👍 Also,  even though the nasi goreng has some sambal in it,  Indonesians tend to put the sambal goreng on the side.  Try making the sambal goreng!! It is REALLY good!  It perfectly matches with the nasi goreng. 👍🙏 try it someday! You could find the video of making of sambal (terasi) goreng! Oh, trust me,   it can go with any SE Asian dishes! 👍😍 I am not a professional chief,  but I cook a lot. Thanks to my mom! 😍🤗👍
I am Indonesian, I prefer nasi goreng without kecap manis. Btw nice job.
Very accurate!
Many kind sambals in Indonesia to combine with fried rice, such as sambal bajak, sambal belacan, sambai terasi kerang, sambal matah etc
do you wanna know the simplest version of nasi goreng? just saute sliced shallots, then add cooked rice, stir, and add salt.
I love the way you say 'krupuk' (terasi is of the essence, imho).
Try cooking the krupuk in the microwave :P I am Indonesian and my dad used to do this all the time since i was a kid.  IT WORKS!!!! just put a few at a time for like 10 to 15 seconds. You will see... if it needs more time. The uncooked part will appear more transparent than the cooked one
I'm a big fan of the Indonesian kitchen, but this huge amount of trassi, salt and then fish sauce??? i don't think that Indonesian use fish sause. However, I think that it can be a substitute for trassi, but really this amout of trassi, salt and fish sauce all together??? It must be really terrible salty.
I am from Myanmar But I love It So So So much
That looks great 👍
Could you reccomend or advise on tips for fried rice? Kinds and tricks? TIA ❤❤❤
Usually i'd love to put meatball, fishball, squids, shrimps, fried anchovy and veggies like cabbage, collard green,  peas 😂 do versatile you can add any kind of things that u desire
very yummy.........
There's just so many variations of Nasi Goreng and i personally like Seafood Nasi Goreng with shrimps fishcake crabmeat & Nasi Goreng Kampung as well with a green chilli paste and anchovies!!!
I love how generous you are with the fried shallots :)
nice also to put cabbage and oyster sauce as a replacement for sweet sauce and also its nice to use tuna as  protein.
Hai,  I eat nasi goreng with "bakwan" (it's like anomiyaki in Japan, but with small size and without chicken) ...  It's will be perfect..   Thanks coz promote Indonesia Food   😁
you sound like you're from Hawaii. Are you?
2.11 your friend is right. I have cook a variant of fried rice with only garlic paste, chilli sauce, scrambled egg and  Sweet soy sauce. And it's not very bad at all wkwk
Wow. I think you're the first non Indonesian i see on youtube who make pretty authentic Nasi Goreng. Im impressed. 👍 special thumbs up for your presentation. That's how it is normally served at the restaurants. You even included fried shallots. Kerupuk yes, kecap manis yes, terasi yessssss. My must have toppings: 1. Fried egg. 2. Cucumber.
The wrong thing about this recipe is you need a hot oil in wok Even it smoked a bit And it'll be tastier
Well done this looks absolutely amazing! I am Indonesian and you did us proud! I make nasi goreng so often it's our usual Sunday big breakfast! I don't usually put the terasi (shrimp paste) but I might try it! The acar is perfect for it, or fresh cucumber would do it too. Thought I mention another quick fried rice I do for the kids, with just garlic and butter, and chicken as protein. Not sure if you have tried nasi goreng padang? It's basically what you did, minus the shrimp and kecap, but more shallots and much much more blendered chili. And instead of chopped green shallots, you add chopped celery leaves. 🌹 Thank you, I love your cooking channel!
I love Indonesian food and also Thai food. Thank you for the recipe❤
Is there any substitute for sweet soy sauce? I don't think we have it here in the Philippines.  But the shrimp chips, we call it kropek here.
You Nasi Goreng will taste better if you fry egg first then followed by the rice
Authentic one Pai.. we called it nasi goreng kampung, with kerupuk, acar, fried shallot.. love it
prawn toast cuts....fixings.
I like the hair cut. 🔥🐶
Who even knows what styrofoam taste like 😂
there is a world rank brand in malaysia....
Authentic ingredients. Authentic method. Authentic presentation. (Pssst! We normally sprinkle the fried shallots directly on the nasi goreng, but what you did is okay too! :D) What's not to like? Big love from Indonesia! <3
tip...Try  using the krupuk as a spoon. ;)
Sawadi Khrap, Wah terimakasih sudah memperkenalkan makanan khas Indonesia, I am from Indonesia. Khopkun Khrap.
Belacan and Terasi is different taste and smell btw
looks yummy😍
Wow,that looks delicious Pailin!! Just add shrimp and sliced indonesian meatball (bakso)...that would be perfect...
Listen here Pai, I tried this Nasi Goreng and it is FANTASTIC 😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥!!! It’s so good! I added bacon, cabbage, shredded carrots sweet peas topped with cucumber, fresh lemon and micro herbs to mine. This is elite honestly. Thank you my whole family LOVES this.!
Muahhh..nasi goreng I like..😜😜😜
If you fry the rice at really high temperature with wok (like in chinese restaurant), then it will be more like roasting rather than frying. thats the true taste of Indonesian street food of Nasi Goreng, i am sure you will love it!
This is my first time checking out the channel. I'm half Indonesian and Bengali from Chinatown NYC
A bit suggestion. I usually fried the protein separately with a bit of the spices (1/4 spoon is enough). Then after you fried the spices step, put the sauces in. Wait until they reduce a bit. It will caramelized a bit  and fused the flavor with the spices much better, then you can add the rice and the protein which you already fried separately. Try it. With the same recipe it will taste much better.
The most authentic Nasi Goreng coming from non-indonesian in Youtube! Good job, Pai 😊
Why dont use MSG?
very super
Wyh did you call it asian food do you call piza as europen teste ?
my family is dutch so we also had nasi goreng a lot!! we usually used onion, corn, and green beans or snap peas in it, and my mum would melt a dollop of wowbutter (peanut allergy house lol) into it before serving! we'd usually eat it with cucumber slices ^^
This is how I make my nasi goreng and I'm Indonesian. Sometime I add sesame oil.
No thanx lol, its not real indo way
Hi thank you so much for your inspiration!  Could you suggest me a couple of good Thai dishes that contain shrimp paste? I am very curious.
The crispy shallot link is wrong
hi i like the way you do it,im from suriname and many indo people live here  ,hmm smell good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-Ty4jwDykA&t=128s
The way she says nasi goreng sounds so Thai.
I'm Indonesian and you make your nasi goreng in the authentic way. I really love your channel. And you pronounce every indonesian word exactly how they should be pronounce. Maybe you should try to make another indonesian recipes like "gado-gado".
LOVE   LOVE   LOVE it. I am Indonesian, but i think you cooked it way way way better than i did. Thanks for cooking it Pai. You are the best!!!
i always enjoy your videos, i love how you go to the trouble to be as authentic as possible.
At the 7:17 mark, I had an egg like that at Little Java restaurant but the yoke was thoroughly cooked.  How do they get it thoroughly cooked yet have it still look like a sunny-side up egg?
Ciye.. ada kecap ACB
got my mouth watering to see this video. I'm Indonesian living in Thailand. If I want KauPad (thai fried rice) let say I can buy. If I want Nasi Goreng, I have to make it by myself. they're really different in taste but still they're so good 👌
Nice
nasi goreng lezat
That nasi goreng looks perfect for me. Although I cook differently with chilli mixed up with garlic, shallot and shrimp paste (terasi/belacan) to make the herbs paste, not mixed up with kecap manis (sweet soy sauce). Usually, Indonesian food rarely add fish sauce, but I might try to add that on my next nasi goreng. I like my nasi goreng to be more reddish than brownish and not too sweet but spicy, so I rarely add kecap manis, just more chilli paste or mixed with other herbs.  The "protein" could be mixed up with sausage, chicken, and eggs on the nasi goreng.
Your indonesian friend taught you well. Greetings from Jakarta.
My favorite dish in the world, i'd eat it every single day! I personally think the key to Nasi Goreng would be the "baceman bawang" and the sweet soysauce. baceman bawang is basically ground up garlic and candle nut, completely submerged in vegetable oil for at least 2 days to ferment in an airtight glass jar and use this fermented oil to toast the herb paste from your recipe. this gives the certain "umpfh" to the overall taste. also great for stir frying base.
i just tried your pad see ew recipe using indonesian sweet soy sauce. it turned out different than the one i used to get delivered from siam cafe to my highschool dorm way back. plus i'm not a good cook so... but the vinegar and cut chilli helped a lot. i don't remember using it back then so thanks for the recipe. btw,  nasi goreng on the street stall usually mix the egg with the rice unless you request otherwise. but, if you ask for an extra fried egg it'll become a special fried rice or nasi goreng spesial. so, to make indonesian dish use sweet soy sauce, to make it special use an extra egg ho ho.
I love some onion pickle on my nasi goreng...
we never use vinegar in sambal....^_^ BUT, LOVE you for making Indonesian Fried Rice...our fave dish!! <3
I love to have emping ( chips made out of melinjo) in my nasi goreng. I was born and raised in Indonesia.
have to have pickled mini-chopped carrot and cucumber as a condiment!!
You should put dried salted fish..
Is that jasmine rice?
Great dish. More than that--great presentation! Thank you very much.
Where can I find the written recipe? Thanks.
Yes, shrimp paste is so aromatic. Another reason to love my comfort food.
Hi, First of allllll I should thank you dear, Thank you sooo much!!!! coz I'm not cooking well, but after watching your recipe I always impressing my husband with my dish....  I don't have time make foods everyday so Saturday is the of cooking of our house, so I'm tried in your style it was great success. Your recipes superb and cool. Thank you..
Hi may i ask sambal oelek is sambal belacan?
Please watch this video for your safety, 1,  https://youtu.be/8fTC5tV3Wnc   2,  https://youtu.be/6e47ez1V_-4  3, https://youtu.be/hB-u5_oZA9E   4,  https://youtu.be/SNUaTbaz1BI   5,   https://youtu.be/T6D0G-ePUnM
Indonesian cuisine is much more diverse than Thai cuisine, many don't taste like Thai food at all. So, underrated in global scene
ตัว c ในภาษามลายูออกเสียง จ belacan อ่านว่า เบอลาจัน
Nyonya siok is the best brand, more expensive though.
I'm Filipina I love indo foods 😘
I like how you pronounce 'nasi goreng' and 'krupuk' correctly 😂
Terasi is the key
You pronounce nasi goreng perfectly. I always use thai sweet soy sauce and i can say it tastes very similar, one thing I noticed that the Indonesian version is little bit sweeter but if you don't have the indonesian version thai version does a really good job too.
remind me, whenever we have leftover rice my mom will cook nasi goreng the day after. she just put whatever we have in the fridge. you can also change the rice with noodles, with the same recipe and toppings >< another toppings like lettuce, fresh cucumber, fried anchovy, fried chicken, sunny side egg or else
Terima kasih banyak....semoga bisa mencoba masakan lain dari negara kami
Hi Pai.. i think you should add stir egg beetween the  shrimp paste and the rice, it will  add more flavour to the rice..however love your channel..love Thai food
PUT THE SHRIMP PASTE!
excellent recipe for nasi goreng, you started with the basics.  keep it up..
Enak enak enak... But if you wanna upgrade your flavor/taste of nasi goreng you can put "pete" or "petai" in there.
FINALLY!!! A foreigner who cooks nasi goreng right!!!! This is pretty authentic!! Thank you Pai!!
Hi Pailin, may I make a suggestion? For a classier or restaurant version of nasi goreng, the rice is often squeezed into a little bowl and then flipped over to make a kinda of dome.
Hi, can we make shrimp paste at home with dry shrimp  ? I live in Brasil, and we don´t have it to buy. Tks
please feature Filipino garlic fried rice 😊
So beautiful and delicious.
Im from Indonesia..  This seem soooo delicious. Xd
I do mine adding few dried anchovies that I fry with the onion !
yeah...i can make nasty whatever at home all the time haha
I was surprised finding you cooking Indonesian fried rice. Yes, Thai and Indonesian food cooked with many ingredients, make them rich in flavor. In fact, Thai food was the first one got me survived in USA. First couple months in US, I was struggling finding food I liked, trying Mexican, Indian, Chinese, American, and I could not get the taste that satisfied my tongue, until I tried Thai curry from local restaurant in Melbourne, FL. Thanks God. Beside, I found Thai people are very friendly. Anyway love your videos, and thanks for your recipes.
Btw, just a little suggestion: don't rely heavily on the sweet soy sauce. That's be like masking the actual flavor of nasi goreng, which is usually flavorful and spicy. You won't taste the actual flavor if you put too much sweet soy sauce, that's why the nasi goreng kampung exists as the contrary version (also several versions that only use little amount of sweet soy sauce).  The keys for great nasi goreng are: 1. The rice; the leftover would be the best. Also, don't cook the rice using too much water, it shouldn't be sticky and should easily "breakable".  2. High heat. Nasi goreng is influenced by Chinese cuisine, afterall.  3. Significant amount of seasoning. The best nasi goreng is the one that is delicious even with less protein, or even if you eat it straight.  4. Use wok. Yep, that's it. Wok will serve you the best. The casted iron one, more specifically. It will distribute the heat more evenly, which is important should you craving for the drier, crustier version of nasi goreng.  Anyway, your video is great and it is really mouthwatering!
Love how precise you pronounce all the Indonesian terms. 😁😁😁
you're doing a good job in cooking nasi goreng, but we usually put the shrimp paste only half of what you've put so the shrimp odor is not overpowering 😊 it's all about "balance" in indonesian food regarding flavour
Looks delicious! come and see our malaysian style nasi goreng at our channel. i'm sure you will like it
I wish the talking was a bit less.  You are a bloody chatterbox otherwise your recipe was good.
If im gonna dream..im dreaming of pai's nasi goreng and add to that on the side pai's octopus hotdogs with her fried chicken (khao pad american vdo) a happy indulgent man i would be! 🤗 cheers!
Make your krupuk your self, its easy and then you are sure there are shrimps in it. Buying  for me is a no no. They have the shrimp color, yeah, we all know what the food industry can do... Cucumber is great with her dish. There so many ways to make this, its a left over dish, this one is great also. Thank you so much..!
Thanks, that is more on point! More like Indonesian cuisine that my Granma cook, Unlike the other Youtubers, you done your research Well.. Love it...
pai.. your so pretty 😊
Delicious Indonesia 🇮🇩 nasi goreng and kerupuk udang 😋
You could also put grind coriander seed and ginger, also sausage is great companion with the fried rice but actually you can put anything you want but this is how I like my fried rice.
I'm gonna cook this right away for my dinner!
Wow you really know your Indonesian cuisine! Great job. New fan right here
Hai, I'm from Indonesia, after i watched your video about nasi goreng. I never put the terasi when i make some nasi goreng, n i always add an egg mix with the rice and put some sausage or bakso "meat ball" as well. But that's very interest because i never use terasi.. hehe
Nasi goreng
If i don't have kecap manis can i add muscovado sugar to the regular Soy sauce ?
Perfectly wonderful! And the food looks nice, too.
Everytime i watch your video i get hungry.... why is it..??? Maybe because i love Asian foods and your way of cocking is so fun and yummy... Need to go now, need to find for some food, i'm starving. Byee.....
Hai Pai.. i love your posts, especially this nasi goreng :) I am not fan of pickles for the side of my nasi goreng, so instead i put some shredded cabbage. It gives very fresh taste of nasi goreng. i think you should try another variation of nasi goreng, it is called nasi goreng ikan asin (nasi goreng with salty fish). Simply delicious!
I love Thai food too. I gained some kilos when I was back from my visit to Thailand a long time ago because I kept on earing and ate all on my plates. The taste of Indonesian and Thai somewhat similar that's why I fell in love with Thai food!
saya biasa makan nasik goren dengan burung puyuh
Thanks miss Pai really appreciate your good work. To me i would love to add some babbage for the topping that's how we usually did for our nasi goreng...😋😋😋😋😋
As you say, a dish to use up leftovers.   Beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, etc  A staple of British troops serving in Malaya in the '60's.
Your house will smell like shrimp paste for a few dayyysss LOL I like that. It smells UMAMI hmmmm. It looks Yummy I love Nasi Goreng
wow!! thank you a lot for made this indonesian food😍😍😍
What if you don't have shrimp paste for stir fried Nasi Goreng?
Looks nice
Selamat Makan https://teespring.com/peace-love-nasi-goreng
I made this last week, following your recipe. It's my first try at cooking south asian food and it was delicious. Thank you so much!
I am a Sri Lankan fan of your's and making some of your popular dishes  like papaya salad, Nas Goreng etc. My family love these. Thanking for your fatastic presentations. Sarath
it needs picked red onion....
is it alright if I don't use terasi ( shrimp paste ) on my nasi goreng?
lived in Penang for 2 1/2 years as a child and this was THE best meal, always a treat for me, thank you for this recipe. my next best was a curry made with "Lee curry paste" it was made with potato, so possibly similar to a massaman.   :)
I know it's optional but I love to put shrimp/diced meatball/little pieces of sausages in my nasi goreng
perfectly indonesia nasi goreng recipe! delicious, yumm! i like indonesia n thai foods 😎
Hi Palini I live in toronto and I cannot find shrimp  paste here. Do you know from where I could get this.
bumbunya anak kost'an ini mah....indonesia banget....wkwkkkk
The belacan will make us sneeze but the taste of nasi goreng will be outta this world!
Hi Pailin's . I really enjoy watching your videos and I love all recepi you show to us . Very amazing . Waiting for new recepi for you 😘
at malaysia called Nasi Goreng Belacan
hi,thanks for the recipe
u should add scrambled egg in it
dear Pai.. I have been living is Indonesia for the last 2 years I can not count the number of different type of Indonesian fried rice. seriously I don't understand why there are so many types. it's like every street has its own fried rice hence every city hence every island.
I like to put Indonesian beef meatball(bakso) and stink bean (petai) in my Nasi Goreng. Also I like to eat it with chicken satay & Bitternut Crackers(emping melinjo). I think we called it Nasi Goreng Kampung(Village Style Nasi Goreng). Suuuper Yummy
In east Java people use ketchup and little bit soy sauce and sweet soy sauce(kecap manis). We put Cabage (cut into thin pieces) and yu choi. Shrimp is also common ingredient. If you like stinky bean (sator) it's also good to mix with.
Indonesians usually cook the egg until the yolk is completely cooked, not runny.
You forgot one thing, the sambal terasi on the side :)
tarasiiiiii
instead terasi you can use also 'ebi' . its kind of dried shrimp or shrimp that have been sun-dried and shrunk to a thumbnail size. Normally you will find it small and dry in the package and then you must put it in the water before use until the shrimp become soft and swell.  Crush it or blend together with your onion. 😊
and where's the sambal chilli? was that in the soya mix?
pailin, wrong pronunciation about belacan. hehe. In malaysia, we call "be" "la" "chan".. not "be la kan". your should try to cook village style fried rice. quite spicy and rich of flavor.
i love your video but the text of ingredients are too short. ❤️but still i press the subscription button 🙆🏻
keropok*
great job
Where is the seasoning. When i make nasi i alwys add seasoning  for nasi or something from a package.
mmmm.... shrimp paste in the air.... hehe i love her 😄
what kind of rice should i use for this, Pailin? from the video it looks like ur using jasmine thai rice but i don't have that & i really want to make this with authentic Indonesian/asian flavour. also, would chinese white rice work for this?
I like to hv fried anchovies and potatoes in my fried rice
You can use lamb instead of chicken..  Please try..  Lap Ciong also nice...
hi! greetings from Indonesia :) yeah, actually you do the great job on each steps. those are what we exactly do when we make a Nasi Goreng. and you pronounce "krupuk", "kecap", etc very well. btw, goodluck to you and i'll be waiting for your another tasteful video :D
lapar.
Hei pai,, thanks for your video. As an Indonesian i can say that your Nasi Goreng is perfect. But if you want to know what else we usually put at our nasi goreng, it is "sambal teri  kacang". I don't know how to say it in english, but basically it is tiny fish and peanut which deep frying and stir in sambal sauce.. thank you..
Can u show us how to make chicken wonton soup please
When she was eating, she looked so mad 😂
Our family eats nasi with a side of sliced pan fried bananas! tastes great!
i love it ...
Mannnnnn.....I am salivating so hard...
You can chili in the herb paste if you prefer spicy food. Meatball or fishcake also common to be add to nasi goreng.
i would add on soy sauce on the egg 😍
i would like to ate 10 plates of Nasi Goreng by your hand .
wow... as an Indonesian I am amazed by the way you imitate our recipe and pallet. Just the way we used to make in here. you can also use fried tofu as a substitute for the Krupuk or fried Tempe.
Add some anchovie to it , give some traditional flavour , but yours just awesome !
my nasi goreng i like to put the stinky  beans and anchovy ,just fried it with onion and chili,than add the anchovy and stinky beans..than the rice add salt ...that's it ..
Any substitute to fish sauce?
pungence the word is being over used... LOL
thanks to promoted Indonesian food. good job :)   greetings from Indonesia
I like my nasi goreng to be super spicy. usually I put fried tofu and fresh cucumber on top of my nasi goreng. tofu and cucumber can balance it, you know, like yin and yang.. lol
Yum! I loooooove Indonesian Food! Please do share more Indonesian Food!
Belacan Aka TERASI :D for sambal
I am Indonesian and i never used "fish sauce" in my Indonesian cuisine!  And its not common in Indonesia
Can you please post a video or give us a recipe here on how to cook Mie Goreng (fried Noodles) with kecap manis in it.Btw, I have tried your Nasi Goreng recipe and loved it !
I love to use chicken sausage , cubed beef , shredded chicken , green chillies and veggies in my nasi .
and ofcourse krupuk!
hi,here in Holland we eat nasi with chicken satay and peanut sauce.
as early as now i've been planning to prepare this alongside with beef rendang for our christmas eve dinner
at 0:44 where do you buy that black thing she's using to smush her ingredients
ejah ajar wak nasi goreng kabu gak mek dio
Pasar = Terasi Restoran = Shrimp Paste
In my hometown in Central Java Indonesia, besides shallots and garlic they add some "pala"(grind together with garlic and shallot). Tomatoes is sliced and stir-fried with the paste together with green onions and vegetables. Before adding the rice add a lil bit of chicken soup --> pour the sauce and add the rice... :D
Hi Pai, I loved to see this video and all you made of cource :). I'm follow you from Barcelona and every video I try to go to my asiatic product to realize your incredible recipe. Thanks you to  give this opportunity to discover your cuisine. See you, bye
Distinction Cooking of Malaysian Food...nice...you can do it....
Nasi Goreng (and all Indonesian food) is very famous in Holland as well (it has to do with the dutch being the former evil colonial overlords.... sorry for that....). At the very least the Indonesian people introduced us dutchies to some serious good eats, because dutch food is admittedly pretty bland in comparison.   But it was fun to watch this basic recipe, and when I make nasi I often use the leftovers as a luxourious breakfast the next morning with a sunny-side up fried egg, ham and defenitely some extra sambal badjak. :-) I also like to add Serundeng (fried coconut) as a condiment to the nasi. I think that gives it a nice extra aromatic flavor.  As for Ketjap. I grew up thinking all soy sauce was suppose to taste sweet! ;-)
mouthwatering terima kasih
you should try sliced bird's eye chillies in light soy sauce, as the condiment. and if you do, you may need to add lesser salt in the rice.   I usually use fish cakes in the rice.  and to round it all up, crispy fried chicken wings!
i think white pepper is quite common used in indonesian fried rice
Short cut to sambal and terasi, use sambal terasi.
Actually can you teach me how to make that sunny side up egg? That's a perfect egg! Did you cover it with a splash of water to cook the white? But that will also cook the yolk...
One of my most fav food! Thank you!
I love your recipe!!! your description on kecap manis spots on, and I like the way you try to pronounce the Indonesian word, and show the ingredients.
Nasi Goreng is my favourite
Fish sauce? No. just, no.
Hi Ms. Palin.What kind of rice you used in Nasi Goreng, can I use Basmati rice? Also did you use the ABC medium sweet soy sauce or just the sweet one?
without chili?
yesterday I try this recipe.. it so so yummy!^.~d thanks for this video..
Love her accent. Great video as always
eeek, u really taste the belacan straight up??? I'm Singaporean of Indonesian/Malay descent and I would never do that! It stinks! Pailin, you are a brave woman! :P
Great as always. I've seen this served with ikan bilis (salty dry anchovies) as a side before
Pretty cool because I see a lot of common ingredients between Thai/Indonesian food and Filipino food, even though all the cuisines are so different from each other! :) We have something similar to 'krupuk' here in the Philippines. We call it 'kropek' :D I just love watching your channel and discovering so many wonderful and delicious things!
Hi Pai, great to see you put this recipe up on your youtube channel. As an Indonesian who live in Australia, a food lover, and a caterer you only missed one ingredient in your nasi goreng paste that is chilli. Indonesians love spicy. Chilli is used for almost of the Indonesian recipe. One more thing, kecap manis is Indonesian secret ingredient and cannot be substituted. I love your videos and inspired me in cooking Thai food.
Why did you change the label I wonder, from Hot Thai to Pai's Kitchen. Oh, and then there's the channel name, which is different again. How come?
I hope she does more Filipino cuisines...
u can add some vegetable,like carrot, French Bean...
thank u for remembering me palin
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😉
I also add ginger and white pepper. Nice recipe tho! Selamat makan.
nasi goreng from indonesia is the best..
Pailin, you can add Fresh Thai Sator Beans To Nasi Goreng too; it is common to see Sator on Fried Rice. In Indonesia, we call Sator "Pete." you can get fresh Thai Sator in Vancouver's Chinatown shop called "Asian Market. " I used to shop there a lot when I was living and studying in Canada.
nasi goreng is lifeeeeeee
For sweet soya sauce its best to use BANGO brand because it has no chemicals, just sugar, black soy bean extract, water and salt. Its Indonesian as well: http://www.jeshinta.com/easterncross/portfolio/bango-sweet-soy-sauce-gluten-free-620ml/
wow it's so different from what I had here (totally fake), thanks for sharing this!!
terima kasih sudah memasak masakan indonesia
as indonesian i just really appreciate how well prepared and researched youve made for this recipe... thank youuu
hello from Indonesia.. finally.. you make the fav dish from our country.. also we have mutton fried rice which recipe is pretty much the same except you need to add some curry flavor.. :)
I will definitely try this for intense studying days!
I like to add stinky beans and a little bit veggies
OMG I stumble upon your channel two days ago and I can't stop watching your recipe videos. Most of the food you cooked are right up my alley. I love spicy, sour and mildly salty foods.
I'm Indonesian. I always like to see your vdio.today I'm so surprais when see you cook my country food.  that is my favorite food too..  nasi  goreng. love u.
Make nasi goreng from malaysia next ... nasi goreng kampung, nasi goreng cili padi, nasi goreng belachan .... Malaysians use cili giling I believe - dehydrated dried cilies ground to a paste.
it's bela-cha-an ...
nasi goreng belacan...😆😆yummy....😋
Hi Pailin iam from Malaysia ...my version of nasi goreng is exactly like how you do it except i used dried anchovies fry it really crispy and pound it and some mixed vegetable ( carrots, beans,corn ) ...
You got it so right, Pailin! It goes well with satay and meat floss normally. Yum...!
The shrimp paste made from Penang, Malaysia where the place I stay. Hehe...Very nice
Very colourful and balanced recipe. I like it!
Looks sooo delicious! I'm indonesian but I've never tried nasi goreng with shrimp paste before. I'll try this thanks Pailin ^^
Yum yum yum ..nasi goreng
could u do lao foood!!!please
How long can you keep the pickled veggies in the fridge?
did you cut your hair???...yummy food by the way
Singaporeans and Malaysians pronounce "belachan" as เบ-ลา-ชาน. Oh and many like to toast it (like toasting chillies for Issan food) for extra flavour! Thanks for the lovely recipe!
i add scrambled egg, sometimes slice sausage, green peas, and believe me put some shreded cheddar cheese right after you cook it will make it extra savory extra amaziingggg! love youuuu pai!
Your videos are those that I never have a second thought on whether or not I'll watch them.  I just came back from Indonesia, your recipe definitely looks as authentic as any Nasi Goreng I've had through out Indonesia.
It's pronounced ber-lah-chaan. :)
nasi goreng emang mantaaap..!!
Can I substitute Onions for Shallots? It's kind of hard to find where I am.
Thanks so much for including metric weights for ingredients (400g rice...). Also really enjoy seeing the local spellings for ingredients (belachan; terasi; kapi) as well as the translations! About the shrimp paste, I'd caution to moderate the added salt when using shrimp paste - it's an optional ingredient for this recipe but it is quite salty and whether one chooses to use it may affect the need for added salt. Once more tip! Some krupuk can be successfully microwaved... lower in fat, no cleanup, fast. Some Thai ones I tried this way, however, were nasty when microwaved.
Im from Malaysia!! I got so excited when u mentioned Malaysian shrimp paste!! it is so popular here!! Keep it up Pai. I love love loveeeeeeee your videos! huge fan from Malaysia 😘😘😘
I'm from Surabaya, Indonesia. My favorite nasi goreng is called 'nasi goreng mawut' which consists of chicken, noodle, cabbage, bean sprout, green mustard (in Indonesia its called sawi hijau) with boiled/fried egg, cucumber (fresh/pickled), fried shallots, & green lettuce as toppings.. Its so delicious.. You have to try it..^^
I'm Indonesian but actually I don't really have a sweet tongue and therefore I'm not really a kecap manis person (I use maggi or regular soy sauce more often) but I must agree that we cannot leave kecap manis for this recipe.  For those with more of a salty tongue like me, in Indonesia there is also a popular kind of homemade fried rice (its rarely found at the streets or in restaurants) which is butter/margarine fried rice, it's a popular school meal for children and it's simply rice fried off with butter/margarine (hence their yellow color) and seasoned with salt or stock powder. Usually an egg will join the party. I sometimes add garlic and green onion for taste and corned beef or sausage for protein, but it's just as good eaten by itself.   Pai, you've done a great job, keep it up!
kecap manis is love. kecap manis is life... 😂
so yummy
You can fry with ikan bilis as well, which are tiny salted fish! My family loves to put in peas and carrots as well. And if you have serunding or haebi hiam that's great sprinkled on top! If you don't have belacan, an interesting alternative is Korean spicy bean paste which gives a different but as good sort of umami flavour.
Pai great dish I would put some sate sauce on the side :-)
I usually scramble eggs with the rice straight away, top with sunny side up egg, fried sjalots, veggies, and some satay or fried chicken on the side. The variation in combinations is endless. Great vid
You may add small red shallots & bird eye chili in your acar recipe. It will add the 'umami' flavor !
TBH I adore ABC Kecap Manis compared to other thick black soy sauce I have used (since my childhood). Others may only have molasses taste and adding colour to the dish, but ABC Kecap Manis have extra kick of sweetness. It works great for almost anything.  I could readily choose it over chilli sauce or tomato ketchup whether for fried chicken, potato fries, keropok/krupuk or even to dip fruits (as a kuah rojak substitute)
Omg! I live your chanel. Love your thai recipes, and this is a pleasant surprise! Love you. Anyway as an Indonesian I approve this. :) Yayy.  But just to add, you can just add fresh red chilies and some bird eye chili (hotter chili) instead of buying seperate sambal.  You can also add veggies there. The most typical in Indonesian fried rice can be mungbean sprout, cabbage, and of course spring onion. The shrimp cracker was made near my town btw :)  Thx for bringing Indonesian recipe. Love you Pai <3
Hi, Pai! I'm Indonesian. And I'm so proud of you to have nasi goreng in your Youtube channel! :) That's absolutely what we have when we eat fried rice. And I think I cannot add some anymore. But, if you want to have a bit 'kick' in your fried rice, put more sambal in it. That's it.  Oh, btw, these are Indonesian recipes that you can try; rendang and gado-gado. They're our signature!   Good job, Pai! Sawadeeka! <3
Yay! I've been wondering how to make this dish for the last week, but now I know!
My dad puts "Ikan Bilis" or fried tiny anchovies with fried peanuts and quick pickle cucumbers on the plate as well!
fried anchovies are delicious tooooooo but keropok is a must when it comes to nasi goreng hehe
hi, can you do a video on how to make the Indonesian condiment, pickled (i think) garlic and green peppers. they are served chopped up in a regular plastic container with a spoon on the table
I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL JUST DISCOVERED IT I'M ADDICTED
I love making a paste of green chilies (not the spicy one), shallots and garlic, sometimes adding Thai basil as well, and make a green nasi goreng. Then sprinkle crispy fried 'ikan teri', anchovies-like fish, and add some  kerupuk 'emping'. So good!
Almost every dish in Indonesia has crispy shallots as a garnish or topping
My grandma always serve us this with a block of kraft cheese on the side. You bite a little bit with each spoon. But my mom always serve us this with chopped sour green mango on the side.
I assume every culture has its own version of how to prepare fried rice! It's such a universal dish! I'm not a rice fan but I loved this video a lot. Thanks so much Pailin. I'm eagerly waiting for your next video already! Love you so much. You definitely make cooking look fun and easy. That's a great message & impression to all modern girls out there who hardly know what even a kitchen is!
i love to put Spam, chicken or pork, frozen pea corn carrot and then top the rice with a sunshine egg just like you. thank you so much for the video. love you.
we usually grind the Chilli with shallot and garlic we also   scramble the egg while we saute the paste but your nasi goreng looks good...
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hi pai, why dont you use the wooden mortar and pestle?
Soy sauce isn't GlutenFree and there's no GlutenFree sweet soy sauce. You stated it has a molasses flavor. Do you think if I used my GlutenFree soy sauce, added molasses and cooked it till thick; if that  will be close to the actual sweet soy sauce? If not, please give me the recipe you'd used. Thanks!
I love to eat my nasi goreng with 'raw' long bean only, i get the savory of the nasi goreng and the vegetable freshness, completely change the flavour
fried anchovy should includ in nasi goreng with a little lime in the sauce, it is divine ;)
you also can add some petai. the smell very strong but the taste so fabulous... 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Great video! But by the way, it's pronounced "bé.la.chan", the "c" is actually pronounced like a "ch".
I could keep going all day!~
For the lazy, you can make a darned good nasi goreng using commercial pastes. I like the one made by Bamboe and always have a few packets on hand for whipping up a quick meal from left-over rice.  As for the egg, that looks perfect...runny yolk and slightly crispy white!
Bami goren the next one please
This recipe looks so great. A nice variation from the fried rice I normally make.
If as per pronunciation, it is 'blaachaan'.
you made it perfectly the same like what we made here in Indonesia. i wish i can give this video a bunch of thumbs up. great job!
Pai, it is "belachan". Stretch the "a" & the letter 'c' is pronounced as 'ch' & not like 'ck'. Hope this helps.
love it. I love to put sausage, frozen peas, meatball and anything I have in fridge
love it. I love to put sausage, frozen peas, meatball and anything I have in fridge
i like to use stinky beans in my nasi goreng. :D
teach us how to make martabak, i miss that the most
LOL it was funny, I was just trying to fix my dinner and I have no idea what to make with my chicken tenderloin and I just fried them quick and start thinking about to check your new video! and I was like screaming because you made Nasi Goreng. OMG <3   I have the same brand of that kerupuk. anyway, ALL of  Indonesian people  having their reunion in your "KITCHEN" now, I mean in this page :)    Anyway.. you are right, Indonesia has most similarities in their cuisine, especially from Sumatera island. I fell in love with Thai cuisine loonggg time ago too and I was saying the same things as you regarding to the fusion :) Eventho some thai cuisine is too spicy for me :P  I have that Sambal Oelek in my fridge, I only used them twice and stop using them. I found that the taste is way too different with the authentic sambal back home in Indo. So, I substitute it with my own or if I am lazy I just thinly sliced 1-2 of thai pepper  ( I'm using one since thai pepper is spicy! ) then add a pinch of ground white pepper... and I am surprised you add scallion at the end of cooking because that was exactly what I'm doing hahaha  Nice work girl... Good luck and much success ahead and bunch of happiness too!    PS : we call it belacan ( Bluh-chan) in Indo too especially in Sumatera... and terasi ( truh-cee)   I am a BIG fan of your vids and I wish we can cook some nasi goreng or some thai green curry together one day! amen
it's probably a huge no go but i love my nasi goreng with nice big splurge of peanut sauce (the same as the satay one) and a lot of sambal on the side.
Any Indonesians here? What do you recommend as a substitute for Kecap Manis? Is it like Hoisin sauce which is also sweet or is it not possible for substitution?  I know that Kecap Manis might've been like the ancestors of Ketchup so would using ketchup be a good substitute?
I just have it on my dinner table wonderful
where did that egg come from? I was looking the whole time. what sorcery is this?
I really like your take on cooking the nasi goreng, i actually never tried it with shrimp paste, gonna try it for lunch but maybe with less kecap manis and lots of sambal 👌.  I usually cook my nasi goreng with literally whatever left in the fridge (all the veggies and proteins), and 'experimenting' with the sauce. There's one time i wildly put hoisin sauce  in it and it didn't turn out well lol. Also i really like my nasi goreng sauce with worcestershire sauce, yum 😋(i know it sounds weird but it really gives a kick to your nasi goreng)
wow!!! makes me hungry it's look good 😀
Hi pai! I'm from a caribbean country called Surinam that is made up of many mixed etnicities such as the indonesian people! Our country is so diverse nonetheless we're basically united by food. Good food is our staple and recipes are there for generations and generations. In my family we sometimes add dried baby shrimp (can also be rehydrated). Another thing we use is oyster sauce mixed with the soy sauce for that umaminess. And another topping i would suggest is fried garlic ! Love your show and love for food!! Keep up the good work.
terima kasih🙏
I love this with Acar (Atjar Tjampoer)!
Ketjap manis is great stuff. Sometimes I even use it with pasta, a little bit to give it a richer, sweeter flavour. Fantastic stuff.  And kroepoek is great as well, especially when dipped in peanut sauce! <3
YES!! Kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) is awesome and lifts up the dish! I'm from Surabaya which is near Sidoarjo where the krupuk is produced. I love eating nasi goreng with krupuk, fried shallots and SHRIMPS sautéed in the nasi goreng!   PS: Pronunciation for kecap manis is on point! :D
hi Pai..the 'C' in Belacan is pronounced in 'Ch' like chutney not 'K'..
Sup! From Indonesia
Hi Pai, I really enjoy your cooking channel, and finally Indonesian cuisine. I love your nasi goreng recipe and excited to try it in my kitchen. 😍
I'm from the Netherlands, and this dish is so common here too. Love it. When I was a child, I only knew ketjap as a soy sauce. I had not seen any other soy sauces yet.You should make Indosian penaut sauce !
Thailand takes on Indonesian version of Chinese food, what a world!
marry me +Pailin!
Ikan Bilis~
hy sweet lady. i am from Suriname. lots of indo people live here. i love to cook nasigoreng just like the one you made. you can add wet or dried shrimps too. the topping is georges.  many thanks♡ greetings.
hi pai!!! belacan is pronounced as ber-la-chan. hope it helps!!!
It's my favourite dish..Thank you pai ♡for shared the recipie :*
Wait is not "Hot Thai Kitchen" anymore😱 But Im liking tge new name btw
Hi, Ms. Pailin! Warmest greetings from Indonesia! <3
Pai Lin, you are amazing! hahaha.. I'm Indonesian and I'm one of your subscriber. I love ALL of your recipes!  By the way, just wanna give additional comments on Nasi Goreng: - that's correct for the white rice, should use the cold rice. Which means you have cooked the white rice at least 4 hours before you make it as nasi goreng. Also, when you make the white rice, make sure you've made it a bit dry. - when mix the ingredients in the wok, please use low heat, but once the white rice, kecap, and salt are included in the wok, it is advisable to use a high heat and toss it until it's all mixed.  That's all.  Thank you Pailin for all of your recipes!
I love this recpice I'm sure this is going to make a spot on my table. (love it)
YAZ NASI GORENG YAZ YAZ YAZ!
Wow! A few simple steps and ingredients, with your talent, looks fantastic.
I can only imagine how flavorful the dish is. Looks so yummy! U got a winner there again Pai.
Nice hair cut, i like that better :) super pretty
น่าอร่อยจริงๆครับ
Yesss! I love nasi goreng especially Nasi Goreng Kampung. Garnished with fried anchovies and kangkung. Yummm
hello from Indonesia,it's past midnight now in here,thank you very much for presenting this popular food which you can actually find from street stalls to five stars hotels :)) and there are many version of this.
