This is the best recipe for a prime rib. I have been using it for years.
Right on thank you chef ! 👍
Way over done for my taste but perfect for the wife!
Massively overcooked,,, but that's fine I guess,, if that's how you like it.  A reverse sear is really the best way to cook such a huge chunk of meat. Season 24 hours before cooking,,, skip the paprika and garlic powder (one is a crutch for color,, one is a crutch for flavor,,,, S&P is enough,, maybe with some Italian seasoning or herbs de Provence if you like,,,, these ain't baby backs). Forget the 2 hours out of the  fridge thing with a reverse sear. Cook on a rack at 200f for however long it takes to get to 118. Tent and rest for an hour (do your side dishes),,, then blast for 10-15 minutes at 500f. Edge to edge medium rare every time and you don't have to rest it at the end..
$100, time flies, let’s go Brandon!
Non edible??? That's good fat brah!!!
Turn down to what temp?
Hey Rodney! Awesome vid!! I sear my roast in a huge cast iron skillet. Just an idea. Paulie
LOVELY AMAZING PRIME RIB THANKS YOU GOODNESS 🌟❤️🖤💚🤎 FAMILY DAPHNE COTTON ALWAYS 💜 AWESOME BEAUTIFUL ✨,
I used to manage the best steak house in the montreal area..only reception halls offered no bone roast..remember....prime rib..so no bone no rib..if u do again with bone..maybe I will give u the most fantastic recipe for prime rib..au jus..good luck..and do it right..
Sorry!!! No bone.= no prince rib...failure..
A little bit of less cooking would make it juicer
Try this..less salt..much less salt..more pepper..and just regular mustard..and then u will c the difference  that draino  makes in all the movie stars.. seriously...mustard..makes all the diff..no mayo no sour cream..
Alton Brown does 250 until 118 in the middle, start with a cold oven, takes about 3 hrs for 5lbs.  Let the roast rest for 30 and then do 15 mins at 450 and it is absolutely perfect.  I did keep the roast out for 2 hrs to bring it closer to room temperature which I don't believe Alton mentioned.
Isn'that the wrong colour plastic cutting board?
Fantastic I yost do fifty years agon
I screamed when he cut the chain off...... cut the extra fat off but that meat is some of the best on the cow
Prime rib with no actual ribs.... FAIL
Wait? What? 20 minutes at 400 degrees? Cook for 2 hours? Is that after you pull it?
Why not season it ahead of time so the salt gets into the meat instead of just on top of the roast? You can salt brine that roast over night and it will be great.
The fat is the best part
Perfection ❤️
Did a 7lb roast last night. 480 degrees for 36 min then shut the oven off. 2 hours later it was perfect pink all the way and ready to cut and serve. Amazing
Award winning. Wonder what he got for his major award?
It’s the Lip not the Chain....
400 for 20 minutes to sear  no other instructions
He skipped the whole part after the 20 minute sear, for the main cook through
Looks so Dam good!!!!!
😋👍
Quick question...how come on a lot of videos I see folks putting oil over the meat before adding the seasoning and you don't?  I'm not saying you are right or they are right, I'm just trying to understand the difference.
Hahaha. $100 or so. U mean $200 or so piece of meat.
Your "Roasting Pan" *sucks*.  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3889328651094621&set=pb.100000525722532.-2207520000..&type=3
Pull at 120 DF because it will carry over to 125 DF.
125 DF is rare........

NEVER TRUST A SKINNY CHEF
I’m surprised he didn’t suggest reverse dear to avoid not overcooking the outer rim by blasting it with 400 for 20min - most I’ve seen with this method had dark outer ring
Just put it in the oven...looks dry. And not following this recipe. Tvm.
Didn't seperate the bones and tie them?
I don’t think it’s over cooked, it’s medium/less rare or bloody. It always looks raw
Um. That’s not the chain. The chain is on the other side. You cut the tail off there chefy boy.
After the 20 minutes at 400 what temperature do I drop it to for the remainder 2hrs?
Oopppsss Looks Amazing
Loos AMAZING! Thank you!
I'll take the 1st slice over that second slice all day long.
Perfectly ruined 🤣
It looks so good😃
5 mins per pound at 500 rounded up to the nearest minute. Turn off oven and don’t open for two hours or until 130 degrees. If you use a thermometer make sure it’s a good one.
Too much seasoning on a beautiful tasty piece of meat
Can’t stand bloody 🥩 cook mine WD don’t care what type of meat it is
Miraqau makes all food great!
“ there is your grey holiday dinner “ he even said it him self 😂😂. Honestly, it did overcooked. This is a really nice Médium well prime rib, I would still eat it but definitely was overdone.
Good job.....now for Christ sakes loose some weight 🐸
I would save that chain for myself too, I love fat
Way overcooked for PR wow most of it was grey hahahah
I had no idea what the “chain” of a rib roast was. Right up until he started cutting it off and I yelled “whoa whoa whoa”!
You lost me when you said you have to pull your chain off!
Big reveal after the first cut...... OVERCOOKED
I would never remove the bones before cooking nor would I remove the chain. Room temp, seasoned and into a 250F oven for 15 min per pound (115 internal temp), rest at least 45 minutes to even an hour and a half then back into 500F for 15 minutes for color and crust. No grey or brown feather meat with consistent color throughout. This video is great for a restaurant where time is a factor. But at home for a holiday, time is on your side. The reverse sear has never let me down for the last 30 years.
@4: mins ish? What is High quality mayonaise??
What ribs
Chef...what did you lower the oven to after the 20 mins at 400?
I'm guessing his beer cups are about 3 pints each going on his 1/4 cup measurements....
Looks good, like mine a bit redder but it’s ALL great if it’s NOT BROWN!
It’s hard to watch over weight chefs. It’s like Opra being the face of weight watchers, just doesn’t compute for me.
400 degs, 20 mins... jump to, roast is done?  Finger stir stick?  Did you just run a marathon?  Jesus H Christ... I think you got ... congestive heart failure.
Organic is the best!!  It tastes better without (round up).
Muchas grasias por compartir bien explicado y se ve delicioso Bendiciones.
Instruction unclear. Used Celsius for degrees.
You Lost me with the finger mix
Disliked soon as he cut the fat off...
I ALWAYS serve Yorkshire pudding with my prime ribs. Sometimes they come out amazing.  Other times, they don't. Can you do a video on one?
That is a boneless rib cook at 5:50 for about 10 minutes to Golden Brown then cook at 2:50 internal temp about the same as he says
Well that was surprise ending and not a good one.
Not to hijack or throw shade on this chef, but Food Wishes gives a great math trick to get succulent rare/med rare results without a thermometer. Check it out (too), everything here works along with the math trick. Tried it, swear by it. Yum out.
Overcooked.
I can't believe the dumb ass comments on this video.  That was beautifully done!  Just silly.  I've personally got six or more ways to cook a great standing rib roast, and this is one of them.  Shame on the haters.  #Clueless
Watch the "how to bbq right" video of prime rib..... Much better looking prime rib, much better sauce and plus its smoked
Overcooked but looks good
Three rib size just cost me $118.00 I want to shop where he shops. Lol.
A 7 lb. one I was going to buy was almost $100.00.
Looks fantastic!
that not prime rib and one small over cooked piece for dinner . what the hec
Looks over cooked, should be uniformly pink.
Clean your kitchen bro! Lol!!!
Is the lighting bad or this roast over cooked?
Bunch of dumbasses in the comment section.
400°
I don’t understand after 20 minutes at four and degrees then what should the temperature be for 2 1/2 hours
I don’t understand at what temperature after 20 minutes
Cook on bones
Who the hell gave this video a thumbs down???? It was well done easy to understand  and informative wth???
Where is the butter????
Dude is breathing heavy
A prime rib has bones what you have is rib eye, and you are a professional?
You people saying it’s not prime rib are morons. It’s most definitely a boneless prime rib . Strip loin is much smaller in diameter
Look overdone
Not prime rib.
Whaaaaaa daaaaaa 🤬 is that!?!?!? You should do a video of filleting it, then burning it. Can bring some strippers in and let them dance on it too. 🤣
Thank you!
Absolutely fantastic recipe 👍🏻
WTF? This isnt prime rib, this is strip loin. NOT the same thing. And you're a chef???
Chef, What did you do with the chain?  And, how much longer do you cook—at what temperature—for well done prime rib?
Delicious
This is a strip loin ( New York steak)he even says it too.., different cut from where the Prime Rib comes from
Overcooked
THAT turkey is drier than a ROCK!!!!
It's better when smoked in my taste buds opinion, either way it's a awesome meal :-)
How about ketchup and mustard on crab legs? Garlic, horseradish and steak sauce on prime rib? Sick!!!
