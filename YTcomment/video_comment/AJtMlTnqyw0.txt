i made this dish several times over the years. never fail to amaze the guests. i sent them this video whenever they needed the recipe❤
Love  it 🙏
You make it the way my old Vietnamese friends mother would make it.
TIME FOR THE WHATTTTT?? ACENT IS RETARDED,
No salt??
Looks like a nice and easy dish to make. I will make this dish soon! Thanks 🙏
You are so cute when you're eating what you cook. There is real enjoyment in your expression. I can almost savor it with you. Keep up the great work.
❤
Just tried this for lunch today! Oh wow, that flavor it was delicious! Like you, I ate the whole bowl standing up! Hahaha
Did you use brown sugar for the sauce? Mine didn't come out as golden as yours.
Ive watched other recipes but i always return to yours, so easy and delicious
I just made it and we just ate it and wow! It was soooo good!! Made exactly by recipe but also added the carrots for crunch (they were so good!!) and my husband is so difficult when it comes to food, I was very happy that he liked it a lot! Definitely will cook again)) thank you))
Just made lovely
Can I use stevia powder instead of sugar?
I made some and it tastes great 😊🥰I like it too 😁👍💕💐
Made this so many times now, absolutely banging; would quite like a bit more sauce if any ideas on how to achieve?
I tried it today..quiet nice..❤❤❤comfort food
Looks gd I will try it!!!
This is the second time I’m attempting this seemingly easy recipe yet I still can’t get it right. The fish sauce mixture ended up too salty, too sweet and the colour is much darker than in the video. And I can’t taste the lemongrass even with 2 stalks n pounded. 🤷🏻‍♀️ May I know what is the best fish sauce brand to cook this ?
Wow this is so yummy
Can we cook it in soy sauce.. i don’t use fish sauce
Yummy 😋 I will make this ❤ thank you ❤
What is the thick sauce that u added last?  I had to watch a few times but it was not mentioned?
Efficient video, clean cut motions. Not a second wasted, very successful 👏👏
No seasoning in the chicken? Just the sauce?
Going to make this tonight ~
I removed the  skin from my thighs this time and cooked the fat down then, saved the skin. I used the oil to fry the chicken as my husband doesn't like the skin on the chicken. I used the skin as a topping for myself on my food.
To much oily
Thank you for this easy yummy recipe and i plan to cook today for lunch time
For anyone who's making this, don't throw away the excess oil from the chicken! It's perfect for stir frying. I especially reccomend using it in fried rice! :)
You r so beautiful. ❤❤
Aren't you supposed to marinate and grill the chicken? She is frying chicken thighs in oil and just pouring the marinate on it. No chance for the chicken to absorb the aromatics. Her recipe is crazy oily.
What was the thick looking sauce that you added at the end after you added the fish sauce with sugar and pepper? It looked kind of like apple sauce.
Look so delicious thks you for the recipe so great...
😂❤🎉 est healthy😢😂❤ spicy😊
Its 2023 and im here because my wife loves your cooking so much.. She always watch your videos..Watching all the way from the Philippines..
Great recipe, you could tell she really enjoyed eating this dish, so quick and easy  my type of cooking, thank you 😉
Thanks for sharing this video..I cooked the  vietnamese chicken with lemongrass  before but I add the fish sauce and vinegar and leaf (Vietnam ) and chili...yummy...
LOVE TO TRY THIS SOON!!
My favorite chicken dish.  Yummm.
Probably delicious
Seriously?
👍
Bad cooking too much oil and fat.
So good i like so much
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤
Thank you for sharing, could  you tell me what is   the thick ingredients you put please.
https://youtu.be/OnJmV9jKnRg
I enjoyed watching you lovely lady make this fantastic chicken dish. It is definitely on my list of future meals now that you showed me how you do it. I would leave the bones in the chicken though because bones give flavor, as does the crispy chicken skin. Like the way you served it too, simple but elegant. Subscribed!!
nice vidio say hello frome lombok
Dont eat fish or use fish oil uugghh
Hi we are allergic to fish sauce. What can I use to replace it?
I tried this with tofu and it tasted just like the lemongrass tofu that I ate at a Vietnamese restaurant for $18.
I went to restaurant called lemongrass. They only had lemongrass rice. I could not get lemongrass chicken. What's the point of the name of this Asian restaurant.
Did you put 2 types of sauces? The other one is somewhat thick compared to the fish sauce+sugar+black pepper sauce.
I cooked this for my family tonight! I've never cooked with lemongrass before but the kitchen smelled AMAZING and I absolutely loved the end product. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you so much for the fabulous recipe :)
Are the Thai chilies hot? Where can I find them?
Hey darling what was that thick sauce you add add the end it wasn't fish and suger !!
no salts 🤔
I made this today and it turned out really delicious! I did not have fresh lemongrass so I used dry lemongrass but it still turned out great!
Funny how she doesn't show you what secret sauce she's using at the end. But it looks like apple sauce or something like that
I love Vietnam.. and wanna learn Vietnamese food that is actually made out of veggies and chicken ❤️..
Doesn’t work for me
That looks like something I would cook! Not a lot of fuss. Thanks for making this video
Thank you.
Ldone really absolutely very delicious recipe amazing Sharing full time watching Like your video thanks for sharing 🌸💕👌
Just made it and it's beautful. I'm a little late to the party but f@!k it 😄
This was really good! I had never tried it. I just made some small changes in the process:  I took the chicken out of the wok once it got that lovely brown color so it wouldnt dry out. Then, I added the onion and lemongrass first, a few minutes later the garlic, and then the chicken and the sauce just to finish up cooking for a couple of minutes.  Chicken was juicy, tender and had all the flavours!   Thank you again
Thanks for the recipe. Am just wondering, you seem to add some chicken stock. How much do you add and also how do you thicken the sauce?
https://youtu.be/5GAK4hBs9OQ
Just made this an yeeeeeessssss it was delicious 😋 make this I add pickled red onion an it was 10/10
any recommendation on fish sauce that isn't high in sodium? i hate when something is too salty
Will try it ✌👌❤🔥👍
I made this for my family, very tasty!! We absolutely loved it!! I'll definitely make it again, thank you very much 👍
Your lemon grass chicken looks so yummy and your hair color is so pretty love the color looks so nice 😊
Great video! Thank You!
Should I add salt？I didn’t see any salt here.
Such a simple, tasty looking recipe. I will definitely try this one. Thank you.

Co Phuong chao con nhin ngon qua 👍😄😄
My sister made this a few weeks ago and I almost cried because it was so good.  I thought she slaved over the stove then she told me that it was so easy to make.  She was right it IS easy!  Thank you Seonkyoung!  This is going in the recipe box!
wish to try this recipe
Could you cook it without the fish sauce? Or any tips to substitute the sauce?
Made this dish earlier today. OMG MF WAS FIRE AF!!! Thank you. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
🐉🐺🐉🇺🇸
Fantastic👍
Looks delicious. You're missing the dipping sauce.
I love eating lemon grass chicken with  little fried rice cake "teok"
Oh wow.  This is six years ago video.  Love your accent.  Anyway, my mom used to make something very similar to yours.  I am about to make my first dish tomorrow using pork instead.  My mom used chicken.  I don't have chicken, so I will use pork.
I just wanted to hear you talk and I’m glad I watched your video as I would have definitely ate the wrong 😑 part of the lemon 🍋 grass. Thank you for your videos 😍
Can you use anything alternate to the fish sauce?
有沒有中文食譜
I love how at the end of your cooking videos, you do a bit of a Mukbang eating all if the food you cooked. So real and relatable
yum!!
kibpy and noice...haha
I am skeptical that this put-all-together recipe is an authentic one.
Instead of (carcinogen) sugar I would use tamarind powder or paste
I had so many lemongrass at the backyard, so i must try this recipe.
Looks very delicious. I can't wait to try this recipe.
Will try this today
Hey You didn’t add salt ? And can I add oyster sauce instead of fish sauce?
https://youtu.be/a08suO1gvu0  Pork lover
I was watching this recipe on a channel that required subscription, so I decided to look it up on YouTube.  I'm so glad I found this.  I'll get the ingredients and prepare it soon thanks so much 🙏
Oh my, am I eating chicken or fish? Tasted tooooo fishy for us, we threw it out.
so good, can i add mint and beansprout?
some other Vietnamese lemongrass chicken recipes calls for oyster sauce and soy sauce, how come this one didnt?
Too salty!
I have been meaning to male this but I can't find fish sauce is there anything else that I can use?
Hai...today im follow your recipie...cook for my familys...SO SO YUMMY...tq😍😍😍🇲🇾
ayam bumbu Serai
You should make a vegetarian version of this!!
wow .. 6 years alredy ... i just made it  this year .. awsome channel ... hope my channel will grow like your channel ... i love to cook ..
Tried this recipe, its so yummy!
Love lemon grass chicken
Hi, my fren forwarded me this video last week and I tried it. It was marvelous and amazing. Thank you.wz.love frm Malaysia. Stay safe 🙏🙏🙏
Instead of putting the oil first to cook the chicken, you can just heat up the wok and once it is hot then and put the skin side of the chicken down to make the skin crispy and get rid of fat from the chicken. If there is not enough oil, can always add later.
Super yummy dish. Lemongrass has such a subtle, yet complex taste/aroma. Thank you!
Me no likey Asian style chicken.
Wow!! This is looking like pretty simple, easy and EXTREMELY DELICIOUS :) !! Thank you for sharing! I definitely will give a try! From your face expression, already know HOW delicious it is ... I can't wait to cook! Thanks again.
My mother in law is Vietnamese and she always make me chicken with lemongrass so delicious recipe !
I will try this verry simple
THE SMELL OF THE LE,MONGRASS  COVER UP MY KITCHEN,  REALLY MAKE UP MY DAY ALL DAY LONG👍
I LOVE YOUR ENERGY! IMMA MAKE THIS LATERRRRRR! LOOKS SOO GOOD
Amazing and weldone sis!! This called “ga kho xa ot” or braised chicken lemon grass, well known home dish in Vietnam in daily meals. Here is tips how to make it very authentic way: 1. Marinate chicken with five-spice powder, sugar, lemongrass, chili and a little fish sauce.   2. Leaving the seasonings infuse for 30 minutes. 3. Fire on high heat, less oil (because the chicken is also fat), fry the lemongrass, chili onion 1 minute. 4. Place all the marrinated chicken meet inside, keep high heat15 minutes. 5. Stir the pan, lower fire, put a tea cup of cold water (or coconut juices). Leave it in 15 minutes until the sauces become condensed.  6. Adding little pepper , NO HERB plz!!  Because herb + heat change the original smell.  Thanks alls!!
Actually traditional, you don’t add any species
I love it. I try it soon.
nice without any hassle
This is the best lemon grass chicken recipe I tried so far. Very smart with the timing on when to add the sauce. It doesn’t dry out at the end by the time the chickens are cooked.
Can I use Oyster sauce instead of fish sauce????
Just made this. But too salty. I think the sauce is more suitable for 2 pieces of chicken thigh and I only used 1 piece. But its nice... thank you
Is it OK to blend the lemongrsss
This is the best thing about being a person in this world. We share and get to enjoy each other's food, music, culture. Man, I've got to make myself some of this!
nice job  thank you
She is cute!
Does anyone can tell what did she add at 03:52? thanks
Looks go good. I can almost smell it.
I've been searching for this dish online - trying to duplicate the first time I had a chicken/lemongrass/rice dish back in 1982 at the first Vietnamese restaurant in Denver (New Saigon).    This is spot on!!   Eating at New Saigon inspired me to learn about Vietnamese cooking and culture and I've since been to Vietnam twice.   Thank you!!!
This food is so delicious. I like your foods naa Dear! THanks for your sharing 😘
made this yesterday for my school task and it was heavenly!! must try!  👍
Can you grate the lemongrass or would it be too fine?
Ah-mazing!!
Ohhh... I can't stand it... you took that first bite then I saw your face... my mouth started to water... 😮😥
시애틀에서 먹었던 레몬그라스치킨생각나요ㅠㅠ
you must be a Korean :)
So yummy... 👍😋😃
Oh yeah 😂
I am going to make this for dinner  tomorrow 🍲 Yummy 🤤
I love this dish 👍😋😋 yum  😁😁 I got a lots of lemons glass at my backyard 🥰 Thanks for sharing. 💗
Very nice beautiful. Love from Sydney.
You are the best!!
Boy oh Boy! Your husband hit the jack pot when he met you.  Good job  ;)
Wah look so jammie  thank you
One of my favorite recipes that I always come back to!
Does anyone know what's the dish's name in Vietnamese?
감사합니다
Anyone know what kind of sugar that was?
What type of oil do you use?
Can you tell me the next one sauce name of fish suace🧐🥰3:52
looks delicious. I don't know if I'm missing something but could someone please tell me what Seonkyoung put in the wok right after the sauce at 3:50 . Please help. Thank you.
Nicely and elaborately explained the recipe.Thanks for sharing.
Wow I’ll try it 💕👍
This has become a firm family favourite, and it's utterly delicious. We also serve it with noodles, and occasionally, add Kimchi as a side... I know, Kimchi is Korean... but honestly, I'm addicted!! The whole dish is superb!  I also make my own Seitan at home, so it's delicious to use as a meat sub, if you're that way inclined!
The most disgusting part of every cooking video, hearing the sound of them eating, especially when they ( in this video) eat with their mouth open... just disgusting bluuuggghhh 🤮 What's the point of showing us how you eat... smh! Just present it, and move on..
You made my dinner with this recipe.  Soooo delicious!  Love it! Thank and greetings from Germany
Your Lemon grass chicken's method is so simple and it's 🤤😋🤪YUMMY!!! ♡ It.😘💕
Crispy echicken skeen. 😂 so cute. Looks amazing. My Filipina friend had a huge lemongrass in her yard. She always made lemongrass chicken. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
This is how the dish was made when I was a little kidz ... except we left the bones and skins on the chicken.  No need to marinate ahead of time although I recalled we seared the chicken over high heat, them adding the ingredients and cook a bit longer.
I made this last time and it was a hit!!!thanks for the easy recipe dear!!!
Thank u for the recipe 😋
Looks good!
Dont know why she was like a mix of Asian and New York. By the way love this recipe thank you 😊
Omg that looks so delicious... and the lemongrass chicken also.
Look so delicious 😋 😍
Thanks for the information on the lemongrass its my first time using it
One of my favorite vietnamese dishes. Im making this today but with halved flats of the the chicken wings and will serve its a side of sautéed green with garlic.
I made this tonight and we liked it. It was a bit on the sweet side, but that's just a little adjustment. Thank you for the recipe!
Inspire me to make a keto recipe from this one
Allow my suggestion, I will fried my garlic, onion and lemongrass to make it smell good first, and then the chicken, that will make the chicken more flavorful, that’s how me and my mom cook at home. Most of Vietnamese will cook like that first. But your recipe still look good
No salt! Really?!
Thanks. What oil was used..
Just made. Von's had Gourmet Garden Lemongrass Paste which seemed an okay substitute for raw veg. Added some bell pepper for color. Skinned chicken. Spousal Unit happy enough.
I love lemongrass chicken
Very yummy , I cook this today 😋😋😋
Looks so good....
Look so delicious dish my friend. I will try to cook this.😋😍
I tried this today and it turned out real good. For those who are not okay with sugar taste you can reduce the sugar.
Its funny when she says seonkyoung longest
its the "mm so good" for me
👍♥️
Fish sauce in chicken?
fantastic! greetings from athens! <3
This is my favorite lemongrass recipe. I started making it this way, for my bahn mi, as well. It has so much more flavor than the grilled recipes. Also, I love the bits of shallot, chilies, and lemongrass that stick to the chicken. It's heavenly in a bowl or a sandwich.
i though koreans doesnt like cilantro
👌🌹🌹🌹
I cooked this recipe and it was amazing. Highly recommended 😁
Is it Ga Xao ot?
You’re the young @maangchi

https://youtu.be/JGVgzM0QN38 Kindly subscribe
it's really delicious, thank you for the recipe ^^
I looks so good i like it! https://youtu.be/Q2ZN7t9HJco
I made this and it’s terribly greasy and terribly fishy. I was really looking forward to lemongrass flavor, but I only tasted fish sauce and chicken grease. What a bummer.
I can't believe we are still eating animal flesh in 2020.
it is very simple! made it and my wife love it. thankss!!
Hi there! Just came across yr channel. Luv the foods you cook. Btw are you  Korean or Thai?🤗
Wow, that was simple and quick. Going to try this tomorrow.
Delicious 😋
好好
I've tried this recipe,, DELICIOUS ❤️
I just made this today with some extra cilantro and wowwww it was so delish! Will definitely be making this more often since it’s so easy to make too!
So delicious 😋  https://youtu.be/DVr6KDoSRSk 👍🏼🔔
You are adorable!  Also, be careful because I see you have burn marks on your arm!
Hi Im Indonesian .. I Love This recipe😍
your look like OA
What market usually can I find lemongrass?
looks delicious, but did i miss the lemon part ?
👍🌹🌹👍👍
THỊT GÀ
I have never tried Vietnamese dish.... But I saw...u added sugar in it and didn't used any salt. Will it taste sweet ?? Just curious....cuz I would like to give it a try... But I am also a bit nervous cuz I hv never added sugar to chicken, it's may b because I am an Indian n we put salt n spice everywhere 😂😌
i have a strange feeling of pornhub when entering this video
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍
no need to add oil before frying the chicken. The skin from the chicken pieces will generate a lot of them of grease already. Since the pan is non stick, it would work perfectly.
I don't have fish sauce 😕 which other sauce can I use.
I made this the other day for the first time. It was amazing 😉
I try to cooked this and it’s delicious. My husband who is fussy love it. Thanks for the delicious recipe
Lime! It's missing lime.
Omg! Never knew it was that easy to make. This is my favorite dish. Thank you.
Love it.good recipe
You making me hungry. I think I have all the recipe to make this tonight, but I don’t have Chinese red Chile’s. I do have another type of fresh red Chile that I bought at Safeway and I only have bone in chicken. I’m going to still try it and let you know how it turned out.
Thanks for sharing 👍
Perfect Idol you the one Fantastic gdbless you
Is it possible to use breast part of chicken?
😁 Nice Day
😁 Kookles good Qulity € 3000 BCE Russia per maand forever you can 🌐
you should marinate the chicken & lemon grass overnight,also you didn't add ginger and scallions, fish sauce & lime or lemon juice
👌👌👌👌
What is cilanthro leaves,wasnt it corriander leaves..or is it celery...🤔🤔🤔
i enjoyed the clip by simply listening to it. Especially the final minute  thanks and keep posting
it's not very traditional but this recipe look so much better tbh lol
Hello.. i want to try your recipe, is it still yummy even without chilli? I love spicy food but My mom don't like. I have to adjust according to her taste. Haha. She's the commander 😁
GREAT recipe.  Loved your vid. Well done !
4 Chicken thighs, boneless, skin on (Approximately 1 lb.) 1/2 Stalk of LEMONGRASS (using only bottom white part, approximately 2 1/2 Tbs.), 4 Cloves GARLIC,  2 Thai CHILI,  1 SHALLOT, 2 Tbs. cooking oil, 2 Tbs. Fish sauce, 2 Tbs. Sugar, 1/4 tsp. Black pepper
This dish should accompany with winter melon soup (Canh Bí Đao) is completely, an awesome Vietnamese home cook perfectly! $25.00 meals for 4 people...unbelievable but it is true!
Yummy 😋😋😋
Wooww super...Me n my fly really luv tis dish...
I watch your videos over and over again. Thank you for all the awesome recipes and your humour - soooooo cool and cute!!!
My dad is trying this out today. I hope he doesn’t light the kitchen on fire😂
She went 👉🏼👈🏼
Will try this tonight! Have SO much lemongrass and there’s only so much lemongrass tea I can drink! 😂
Love it😘
Thumbs up, easy to cook... Thx for sharing
What was the item (yellow paste) you added to the chicken with sauce at the end?
Just made this for dinner 10 minutes ago. Delicious!!
If we use lemongrass powder, how much would we use in place of fresh lemongrass? Also why no fresh lime juice in the sauce? Most Viet recipes call for it.
Looks delicious 😋 is the Thai Chili’s really spicy. Can I use Soy Sauce instead of fish Sauce ?
Don’t you think 2 table spoon is too much sugar ???
Made it a few times for friends. Always a killer dish! Its sooo dang good. Do it just like she says...best you can. They all asked for the recipe...and I gave them your channel. Rock on Ms. Marion.
I made this today...for the first time (making it, not eating it) and it was delicious and easy. Thank You for such a good recipe!
Tried it myself and was very easy and yummy! I just added some vegetables as I needed to use them, went very well. Many thanks :).
I just made this recipe and holy crap is it amazing!!!!! Sharing this to all my friends who cook. Thank you!
Love her recipes but I can't stand her commentaries.
Cooked this for dinner and the taste is magnificent!! And took less time to prepare too. Thank you and love you 💕
I tried this, wiped out! ha ha, thank you so much! :)
Making this tomorrow night for dinner.  Can't wait!
you cook wrong style , put lemond grass into oil pan first
Made Kim chi instead of lemon grass chicken
The secret is in cooking the chicken with skin and the aromatics and secret sauce at the end. 3 things
Tried it and really loved it. Very simple, easy and delicious!
Too much sugar!!!
I have made this dish over 100x lost count. Simple easy and delicious my go to meal
THANKS YOU GOODNESS 🌟 VIENAMESE CUISINE AMAZING ❤️🖤💚🤎 FAMILY DAPHNE COTTON ALWAYS 💜
You are so amazing!
Honestly one of the best dishes I’ve made!
Can you replace the fish sauce by soy sauce ?
Hi I am from Malaysia and i cooked this for lunch and again for dinner today as my husband and kids loved them so much.Amazing dish.First time cooking a Vietnamese dish.tq very much
I know how to make this
OMG! I made it and I cant believe that it turned out so good! Thank You
Made me hungry
Your hair looks so cute like this
You’re so pretty l.  Love your cooking.
Wow I just made this today and it is delicious 👏🏼
The hair is untidy for cooking. Not hygienic.  Looking sexy should be at different time.
You are good.  Very delicious recipes!
Good food making dear
Made it. Best lemongrass chicken recipe I’ve tried! Thank you!
You are sexy baby💋💐
Just love you!  Your personality is so fun and motivating!  Thank you for all the recipes!
How you make food so shiny... sugar secret??
This is stupid, how is this a cooking episode and you even tell the ingredients in the sauce. How are we supposed to make it guess the damn ingredients. Asian at home my ass
Quick story:  The other night, I made chicken and lemongrass, but I fried the lemongrass and garlic for a bit first before adding the chicken - and  I didn't taste the lemongrass! After seeing your video  I followed your steps and the lemongrass was the star of the show!  When I made it before I added fish sauce and a bit of sugar.  When I made it after watching your video I ran out of Fish sauce and was stuck with Soy Sauce.  I added a bit more sugar this time.  I'm wondering which ingredient magnifies the flavor of lemongrass, Sugar or Soy/Fish Sauce?    Thanks, you're awesome! :-)
This dish is so delicious 😋
So making this
Where is lamon😬😬😬
Can I do it without lemongrass ? 😛
Made this about a year ago. My guests are STILL talking about it. Really delicious recipe. (But you don't 'de-bone'' meat. You just 'bone' it. Paradoxically, that means you're removing the bone. But it's not de-boning, it's just 'boning'.)
Vietnam no.1
Thank you for your recipe !! It came out amazing . I did it with chicken breast and added broccoli . Everyone loved it !!!
Nice food

Thanks for sharing! I made this and it was so good and easy! Next time I would control the sugar level of the sauce to taste since it could have been a little less sweet (though I love sweet food!)
My 5 years old girl watch your video almost everyday and she loves your cooking channel. She wanted me to tell you she likes you and told me she wants to go to your home.
You so beautiful!!!

Good recipe
I just cooked it yesterday!
The sugar put me off! Otherwise this would be a delicious dish
The Fish sauce smells the house a little but it was good.
Tried this today and it was so good! Never had this before so I didn't know what to expect but I'm so glad I tried!
I'm not vietnamese but I would love to try this soon. Thank you For sharing love from Philippines.
This is really cool you've sent me over $1364 of this tool now available for you to speed up the registration  makeonlinepyp.win?6pEN4K Great Work...
Yummy
when do you put salt?
Do you deliver at home my girlfriend said she want some
Very sad what she did with that excess oil. Then again, I am not Asian. I am Latino. And what we do with that oil ... wonderful! Probably very different from Asian traditions. You take that oil, put it in a sauce pan,   drop some onion, bell pepper and tomato in there, wait till they get soft, and then drop rice in there. After three minutes, add water or chicken broth. Bring to boil, cover and simmer under lower heat. 30 minutes later, you have a wonderful rice! I bet it goes amazing with that lemongrass chicken! I am so hungry now!
👍
Looks amazing BUT isn't 2 TBSP sugar excessive? Does it need to be THAT sweet? Also,  can the fish sauce be substituted for plain cooking salt? I'm not a fan of the smell and flavour of fish sauce 😩
Omg,..Its easy to make it....thank u so much for ur recipe..Love it...
Simple and doable and not expensive.  Thank you.
I am making this right now!
Why am I just discovering you! New subscriber here! This looks so delicious 😋 I know my family would love this! Wow, well done 👍 thank you for sharing👏

Can i substitute the fish sauce with anything else? I do not eat fish or fish products. I really want to give ur recipe a try. Thanks.
Can you use OTHER chicken parts because I don't actually like chicken thighs.  Looks good though!
Love u from Vietnam ^^
I just love your cooking, I learn so much from you, I cooked two of your dishes for my family and I'm Mexican American, your channel makes me so hungry, you're an extroardinary lady.  Sending my love from Tucson Arizona.
What kind of fish sauce? I don’t like the one I have at home lol
Love Haitians cuisine
Can you use the excess oil or throw it out?
I can tell it's DELICIOUS
Can I use soy sauce instead of fish sauce?
I just tried this delicious recipe. It was sooo good. I was worried about sautéing the chicken without salt or pepper but it turned out very flavorful in the end after adding all of the ingredients 👍❤️
excellent!!
Can’t Waite to make it, looks so delicious yummmmmm
I didn't like the lemon grass taste!! One of my student brought me lemon grass chicken fried  I didn't like the taste
LIKE👍👍👍NEW SUBSCRIBER FROM THE PHILIPPINES
I tried your recipe, it’s awesome!!
Yumy yumy
They r very yummi. Mmmmmm
This Lemongrass chicken is really good. It wasn't super salty, super sweet, nor super spicy like I thought it would be. I used skinless chicken since its the only one I had, and it turned out great. I ate it with lettuce and made some lettuce wraps with it! Yum😋 Also, I was skeptical of using a filipino fish sauce(since I didnt have a viet fish sauce) but it still turned out good.
Yummy
I made it and it came out sooooooooo goood!!!!!!!!!!!
I made this tonight with soy  "chicken" no peppers 😫 didn't have any and it still came out really good
She def knows how to cook 👏👏👏👏
For anyone who wants to have another dish in addition to this one: all ingredients and measurements are the same, but you add 1/2 tbs (or a bit more, depend on taste) of curry powder before add in the fish sauce mixture. Toss and stir all for one minute, then add the fish sauce mixture. I agree with the comment below, i would cook the shallots and garlic with the chicken first. Really yummy

Just made this and it was delicious.
Made this dish many times. Love it every time. I also tried it with just tofu and string beans, it was divine!
Can i just blend all the ingredients instead of chopping them finely by hand.any difference?  Pl let me know thanks
Omg I have all the ingredients I could totally make this today! Looks so good!!
I just finished devouring this dish after following your recipe. Hands down, the best I’ve ever had! Thank you so much! Sooo flavorful
👍👍👍👍👍😍 from PhiLs!
I just made this dish.. AWESOME! wow.. whodathunk.. its so simple.. thank you again for the new recipe that im adding to my collection!
for vegetarians - what is the substitute for fish sauce?
Yummy 😋 💖
I made this Lemongrass Chicken yesterday. It came out delicious! Thank you so much for your recipes. You're the best!
Omg...looks so yummy! U make my mouth watery!
You are very sweet, polite, good in explaining, a wonderful cook and a good presenter.
I made this and it was super tasty! Thank you and Happy New Year!
Way to much garlic.
Like your videos however seriously didnt know why I followed a korean persons directions to cook a vietnamese dish. Turned out inedible and taste nothing like the real dish. So disappointed and so sickly sweet. Checked helenrecipes and its 3 tbs fish sauce to 1 tbs sugar. Thats a big difference...LESS SUGAR!

This is more like a Korean Style Lemongrass Chicken. My mom said this is not how She was taught in Vietnam.
Can I use frozen lemongrass  ?
You are good , keep cooking.......
Close to my family's version. Would add more chili peppers, more lemongrass, and less sugar and maybe tad bit of salt on top of fish sauce. Oh and some lime juice to even out the flavors. Very nice though!
Where’s your cookbook??
This looks so yummy and simple. I  bought all the ingredients. I will make this recipe on Sunday. Thanks for sharing!
Because of the fish sauce, is it fishy tasting?
I have never cooked a Vietnamese dish before but I decided to try this recipe and it turned out so delicious. I'm not used to the smell of fish sauce so I had to get past the unfamiliar smells but once I did I was so thankful. Thanks for sharing and helping us cook Vietnamese dishes!
I made these for dinner last night and was surprised to see that they licked the plates clean 😂 it was too delicious ✨
Yummmm
You are too good!! Thanx for sharing such easy n delicious recipe 👍🏼
I finally asked them at the grocery store and found two small little chop pieces $2.95 for each piece but I bought them chopped up fine it does have a great flavor I do love it thank you
you know its good she took a big ol bite. I so wanna try this looked quick and easy.
can't wait to try this dish.thank you
yummy and easy ^0^
Looks great..thanks
Thank u so much my daughter loves ur videos since she was a baby and she still blows kisses at u thank u
😙💜⚘💜⚘💜⚘💜⚘💜⚘💜⚘
You deserve 10 thumbs up. "YUMMY"
I cannot find lemongrass in our grocery stores here in northeast PA
U can add  a pinch of salt and pepper on the chicken .
very educational and yummy
I'm not a Vietnamese, but I knew the fact that asian people, especially South East Asian, where I came from, always brown the aromatic in the oil first, before adding the chicken. Just saying... :) Beside, this lemongrass chicken does not look like the one that I ate in the Vietnames restaurant, especially the color, and your aromatics doesn't seem to be cook long enough.
I love LOVE this recipe! I wanted to eat the Hot and Spicy Chicken with Ginger version, as a local Vietnamese place around here had a great dish. So I just added ginger to this recipe and a BUNCH more thai chili pepper as I love spicy. I can eat this EVERY day! <3
Is there a substitute for fish sauce? My husband is allergic.
let me try now 😍 thank you 😗 from 🇮🇩
Look delicious, ik wil try to cook thanks for simple recept
Crap..I’m cooking this. 🤤
Good simple recipe but skipping sugar :)
Is the thai chili too spicy? Or is it flavourfull with mild spice. The one I've had at a Viernamese retaurant here is not spicy.  I want to make it but not too spicy for my kids. Can you let me know if it is mild, or if it will change the flavor of the dish top much or I can substitute for another thing.
i just tried it there is way too much sugar and fish sauce in recipe. tasted disgusitng. RIP my chicken thighs
Too oily 🙈
Love your recipe and your makeup! 😍
This looks amazing
Looks so good, I will try it for family dinner tonight.
I cooked it today and it was amazing! Thanks for the receip! I had guests today and they were very exited! The only thing I've changed I gave choped ginger to the rest.
My wife and I loved this recipe! Bout to add this to our weekly dinner rotation.
I just made this and it’s absolutely delicious, the only problem is now my whole house smells like fish sauce lol
Just made that for lunch. It was insanely good. Thank you very very much for this awesome recipe!
Amazing! Love your energy too ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  New subby 👌🏼
Just being picky, but I think “Asia at Home” would be a better title. A taste of Asia at home. Asian is people from Asia. Unless you wanted to say Asian people in ur house 😝. Sorry for being picky. I enjoyed your video. U have a very enthusiastic personality.
Yummy! Ex the skin and fat, please...
I really enjoy all ur videos!! Thank u so much!! Can you please tell me the brand of ur wok?
Yummmy! I tried make that already and served with Jasmin Rice. WINNER!:)
Superb cooking channel. Asian cuisine is the best in the world.
This looks awesome! I love Vietnamese, yum!
When I learn how to cook a dish from another cuisine, I’d love to know where I done wrong so I can cook it right.    You made this dish wrong.  You are supposed to mince a combination of garlic and shallots NOT slice like how you done here...lemongrass should be very finely minced/grinded, or it will be very difficult to chew.  We also need to sauté the shallots/ garlic then add lemon grass and sauté well until it’s very aromatic.  Add chicken ... Without sautéing lemongrass well first in oil, you have lost 3/4 of its flavor.
This one works well I use this recipe for backup.
한국분이신가요?
Great
We are making this for dinner this week.  Thank you so much for this video.  Gomabseubnida from Niagara Falls.
Way too much oil on this dish! Yuck 😝😝
hummm yummeee... i like it thai food thanks for your cooking
Made this today. So delicious and easy!
I just made this dish today and it was delicious! A little tip for everyone who is going to make this dish is that, fish sauce has a very strong flavor and smell, so cut down the fish sauce, use just a few drops will achieve the same goal, or the dish become very salty. My husband was complaining that I stank the entire house, lol. Just my two cents. :)  I also, added scallions into this dish. Enjoy!
I am hungry 🤤
I love your channel so much I barely found it, I love so many Asian type of foods and am so excited how easy you make it, you made me like chicken again :)
Drooling 🤤
Your hair looks really good! Yummy food!
When I added the onions, it started boiling. I think I'll remove the chicken first next time.
Will you please share the brand of the wok you are using?
How do u take out the white part for lemongrass?
hello, cannot get here the shikapham, cld you give me substitution please ?

OK thanks I will give it a try   if looks so  good

Loved to watch her cooking!

This looks so yum 😋 I wanna make it for my family!! The flavor and everything just looks so yummy 1. Chicken Read More
Omgggggg yummmm!! Must try this out today after work!!!
Looks delicious it looks like you added a thicker sauce after the fish sauce mix what was that?
I'm so glad you said that about fried tofu.  I finally found lemongrass at my supermarket and got some ... and had no idea what to use it with.  I'm trying not to eat meat ... so tofu would be awesome!! This looks amazing! Thanks Seonkyoung!!
i love you!! from australia
Dame esta receta pero en español.. Hablas muy rapido q no t entieendo...un beso jenial...en nombre de la salsa...?...kiss..kiss to you
I like you food and I like you
Hello! Can you please make shrimps fried rice? Thank you very much.
Thank you... incredibly delicious and easy to prepare
Omg ! I made this tonight and my husband looooooved it! I didn't even taste it till we sat down together and ate together! Thank you sooooo much! Going to make this again!
Amazing. Thank you
what did you add after the fish sauce?.. time 3:52
😘😘 i wan't  tray cooking  I thing this food my employer like 😊😊
Delicious good job.
Seonkyoung Longest, can I substitute the fish sauce with another sauce?
After watching your video, today I cooked this dish maybe I remove all the skin it look so pale. but taste good!
Another one of your recipe that never disappoint. Normally u take me to Korea but this meal we went to Vietnam! Glad to b a subscriber. My sincere compliments!
It's so goooooddddd thanks for The recipes seonkyoung
any alternative for the fish sauce?
Made this recipe. So easy, yet so tasty. Made it again with beef skirt steak. So good. Your recipes are so easy to follow, use readily available ingredients, and very delicious. Thanks!
This looks scrumptious and fairly easy to prepare and cook; well in the video anyway....is the sugar necessary?
I had this at a food truck down in Charleston for lunch every day for a month while I was doing a research project. It was always just called chicken thigh. And I have been looking for the recipe forever! Thank you!
*Better to replace the tofu by legumes (especially chick peas, miam) for a veggie plate. The tofu these days is just way too GMOed.*
My favorite dish for the past couple wks for dinner.. It's so easy and simply but yet very delicious. Thanks for the recipe 👏
im going to cook this for my bf breakfast! thank you seonkyoung ❤
V Xbox.     I yhpgcpp
Love all of your videos new and old. Don't ever worry about judgmental people-there is no pleasing them. It is your channel, you do whatever you want. I just realized how much I miss the background music with the children singing haha!
This is so easy!  I want to make it!
I love you and your enthusiasm 👍
I am going to try this tonight
When preparing the sauce, what would the difference be if light brown sugar is used instead of regular white sugar? I figure that white sugar would be sweeter than brown sugar.
Amazing!! Love your channel!!
I try it for the first time & and it was delicious. 😋 totally recommend this recipe ❤❤
Thia dish is called gà xào sả ớt
I like your style!
I can  tell you love food, I talk about food like sex too!!! 😂😂😂😂
love  all your videos  is short simple and easy too follow
❤️ U
i cant play this video
i made this yesterday for my husband and it was good! just a little tip for others who are planning to cook this - be easy with the fish sauce. I only used 1 tbsp but it was a little salty for my taste so I added a little honey to counteract the saltiness. also if you're using lemongrass that has been sitting in the fridge for a little while, cook them first with the garlic before you add the onions because if you dont, your onions will be very wilted while your lemongrass is still crunchy (but if you prefer that texture its fine). all in all it was a very good recipe, ill definitely cooking this again!
Making now. Smells heavenly. Thank you for all your wonderful recipes!
Hi Seonkyoung, wat is the 'yelllow sauce' that you added lastly? TIA
I like how this girl can eat and she's so skinny lol.. that's how I am and they say "where do you put it all" hahaha love you seonkyoung 💖
wow delicious
💦 👄yummy . Simple, easy n yummy 👍.
The fish sauce makes it smell like hooker's panties for a bit, but the taste is fucking amazing after you cook the sauce down. Well worth it!!! I've made this recipe many times and now I'm gonna make it for my friends. 😄
👍👍🤗
omg everything on this channel looks heavenly delicious
as always, amazing😋 going to let my 14 yr old granddaughter create this one. good starter
Wow👧yummy,i will try it at home😊thanks u..
Thank you so much for sharing your skills WOW i cant wait to try it
Looks so simple. Will definitely give this a try! =)
Can you make sweet and sour chicken? please😊
Yummy
i already cook this about 10 times...its super easy and delicious😘thank you, its amazing😊
This is a silly question but what does lemongrass taste like?
Will it be a big different without fish sauce？
I just found your channel, and I absolutely love your videos! Everything looks so delicious!
Making this right now!!!!! It smells so good can't wait to dig in
if you could just do a montage from all your videos of all your chopping, thatll be great! something about that slice and chomp sound.
I just love how this recipe looks!! Seems fairly easy (which is good for me!). I must try it soon! Also - I was wondering about the artist and song title for the music at the very end? Thanx, Seonkyoung... you are the best!!  :)
u forgot to put salt..
I Love your recipes!!
Yummmmmm! I'm totally going to make this soon!!
Not enough thumbs up for this recipe! Amazing!!
Look at the size of that lemongrass!!! In europe, lemongrass is not even a quarter of that :(
😋😋😋😋🌶
My girlfriend is vietnamese and im learning to cook vietnamese food thks
Great recipe!! Thank you for sharing with us, I must add you are absolutely adorable ❤
Looks super delish!!!! so gonna make this!!! Thanks for making this!

can i find thai chili's & lemongrass at a regular grocery store
Much sweet
A fine chef in the kitchen, love your show Seon !! Keep it up
Thank you for the recipe! Had this yesterday for dinner. I added orange bell peppers with everything else. ☺️👍
Could you substitute honey for the sugar as a healthier option?
Yummy!
As always! your recipe is very easy and delicious! I am becoming addict to your recipes, thanks Seonkyoung. Greetings from Texas.
Yummy😲😍
Listen, this is the closest thing to the restaurant version I've ever had. I love that you brown the chicken and get the fluid out FIRST. It's usually the opposite in Vietnamese cooking but the drier pan I think makes the vegetables get aromatic quicker without getting too oily and wilted, and also makes for a much leaner meal in general.
soo good
you put me in mind of nigela lawson  but better your hubby a lucky mam if you dont have the knife skills like you do wat other way can you use to get them so small i tried it but found the pieces to big
I just finished making and eating this delicious meal.  I took one of the viewer's advice to infuse the oil with the lemongrass, garlic, and Thai chili before adding the chicken. I added very little oil to the pan because I saw Seonkyoung poured out so much after frying her chicken.  Since my pan had very little oil and the chicken did not generate much oil; the lemongrass, garlic, and Thai chili got stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I used about 1/4 cup coconut water (more flavor) instead of tap water to scrape the good stuff, added the onion, and finally the sauce into the pan.  Oh my, the chicken was so good with the steamy white rice.  I had thought about plating the chicken then add the rice into the pan, but I was so hungry, maybe next time. I will cook this again tonight with ginger instead, because I ran out of lemongrass.  Thank you for a great meal Seonkyoung😋
You can use that remaining fat to make khao mun gai
Thank you so much. I tried it and it was GREAT.
Hi! I love watching your videos, and trying your recipes is really fantastic and delicious. I just wonder if you have a cookbook? Im from Norway and your videos is very helpful for me to follow. The only problem here is, Asian store here in Norway does not have all the asian products. But trying your recipes still came out very delicious. I love Korean food the most and all asian foods of course.
can i yse something other than fish sauce.  my mother is allergic to it
unni im not asian. But addicted to ur recipes which are making me watery mouth and seriously sometimes not able to watch ending part. Cuz ure eating so well and showing how delicious they are. all the best. Youre  jjang <3
Do you have a tutorial on knife sharpening? Great video! I've never cooked with lemongrass.
Omg just made this!! Thank you so much for this recipe!! It was so simple and easy. Won't be needing to go to Vietnamese restaurants anymore!! My boyfriend loved it as welI!! Xoxo
I live in a small town and don't think the grocery stores here carry Lemongrass. Is there anyway I can substitute it?
Wow! So easy!!
Made it with skinless, boneless chicken thighs and got the thumbs up from my family. Thanks!
Made this loved night! Loved it!!!
I love you! Do you have a sister just like you that needs a green card? I will marry her. Your recipes are so amazing and you make it look so easy.
Thank you so much..Seonkyoung...who doesn't love simple yet superb food? Who?  Can't wait to put the lemongrass outside to better use. Peace.
I just made this last night but with pork neck..... SOOOOO DELICIOUSSSSS!! And tonight i'm going to make it again with chicken as shown for out dinner party at home.. I am soo sure, it will be a hit! Thanks, and lots of love from Macau.. Xxx
why do i always watch the cooking channel and drool all over just to get more hungry.
I'm Vietnamese and I failed to cook this dish couple times before. Then I found your recipe and decided to give it a try. The result was amazing. The dish was flavourful and tasty. My younger brother even asked me how to cook this dish and I showed him your recipe. You are amazing ❤
Omg!! Why do I watch your channel at night! I'm soooo hungry Lol
Brilliant...cannot wait to try this @ home :)
can't stop watching this video. looks soooo good!
i´ll definitely try this one
you rock awesome🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌👌👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏
I made this recipe! It was so delicious and easy! :) Thank you, Seonkyoung!
love your show
Superb Simply Superb I Shall Be Making This No Problem Thank You XXX
Well, there you go, thanks for the drool on my keyboard!  I love how she actually tastes the food in the end. With some food channels they don't (some don't even show the actual results in the thumbnail). I bet in a year of 2 this will be million+ subs channel :)
After you added the fish sauce, I saw you add a thicker sauce (looked almost like Mama Sita's sauce), what was it??
I planned to make this dish for my bf but when he came back home he said he was so full after having dinner with his friends. I was upset. When I tried the first bite no joke but it was fricking yummy at the same time I was kinda thankful I could eat this dish without sharing with anyone. You guys should try this dish! I'm a fan of fish sauce so I put more than what it says on the description box. Definitely recommended! And thanks for the recipe))

looks yummy !!
Does the fish sauce make it taste really fishy? I don't like a fishy taste.
that looks yummmmm
You look lovely . :)
Everytime I got no inspiration to cook your chanel is a must! please make an app honey
actually, vietnamese lemongrass chicken is very good with Thai basal more than cilantro
Is it possible to use something else than chicken? Like pork, scampi or something else? I love the dish as it is, but I've started to get allergic to chicken :/
THUMBS UP....!!!!
I made this a while back. It was sooooo good. This taste so much better than the one I had at Vietnamese restaurant. I love your food. I tried a few of your recipe and it is soo good and to die for. Thanks for sharing!
Lol she got a big mouth... Looks yummy tho
Super easy!! Soooo delicious!!
I did it! It tastes so good... Many thanks for this simple, delicious recipe :)
Seonkyoung the recipe was bomb. Thank you for sharing. Love love the recipe.
Se ve divino!! felicidades por este canal.
this Vietnamese dish is great 😉😉😉 i just wish that in Vietnam they wouldn't make it such salty, you guys have no idea how salty traditional Vietnamese dishes are 😂😂😂
Wheres your husband? Food looks good too!!
Using pork instead of chicken it's the same recipes and should I use pork shoulders or pork belly please advise asap. Thanks for all the great recipes

This is delicious! Thanks for sharing :)
I made this today and all I can say is... WOW!!! This is just one of the best things that I've ever ate IN MY WHOLE LIFE!!
A very yummy dish! I just tried it! Thanks +Seonkyoung Longest !!
wow, i love what you are cooking,  WIll try  it   for my family.  Good job!
I grew up in Vietnam and I have to say you did a pretty good job. Your instructions and procedures are super easy to follow. subscribed! 👍👍
i make this all the time but I always marinate which takes some time. I will try it this way to see if the chicken will taste better. Awesome vid!!!
Thanks! I love this!
I am worried that the chicken won't have enough flavor, they are not marinated, and cooked with no salt, only had a few minutes to mingle with fish source, is it enough?
Just made this and it was the bomb!! I used frozen lemon grass and it was amazing! My kitchen stinks now tho from the fish sauce lol
This is the best recipe. Im Vietnamese, and i love this dish. So easy and delicious.  My hubby is very picky and he loves it. Thank you for thr fabulous recipes.
This is delicious! I'm used to the marinating the chicken for like an hour but today I didn't have time to wait so I decided to give yours a try. And wow! so simple, so easy, and best of all, it only took me half an hour to prep and cook! Definitely using this way from now on.
We adore your Channel! Will make this tonight! Fab!
Looks and sounds great!  Can't wait to make it but what is the last thing you put in it? It looks like a gravy or gelatin or something? It was after you put the fish sauce mix in.
I do love your videos. I watch each one many times. I made some Korean food, Chinese food which you share w us.Your recipes are always awesome. I always make the lemongrass chicken like that the chicken is marinated with all the ingredients above and some curry powder ( the curry powder will make the chicken has a nice color and aromatic smell) in 30 mins. after that I add 2 tsp cooking oil in the pan over high hit w some garlic,curry powder,shallot, lemongrass around 30 seconds, then add the chicken which I marinated. But I still love the way that you made. Thanks for sharing the Vietnamese food n always keep watching your videos ;)
Just made this dish and I can't wait to dig in :)
Did you use brown sugar? Your sugar looks a little darker then regular sugar?
Try this for my dinner today... And its so damn good...  I really luv it.  I only used 2 chicken with same amount of sauce... Luv ur recipe... Thank u

Word of caution: to each his own but I will say the next time I make this when adding the sauce---I'll be making it outside! It stunk up my whole house otherwise it was very easy and yummy!
You should be the next Miss Universe Korea you are so beautiful it's Ridiculous !!!!.
Seonkyoung, this was amazing! Not gonna lie, the fish sauce smell scared me but the taste was so good and it was as easy as you said. Next I think I might try the Banh Mi Pizza.

I'm vietnamese, and this is delicious !!!! Thank you !
What kind of pots and pans do u use?
That was brown sugar  ??
this looks awesome, Seonkyoung! Gonna make this for Sunday night dinner today. :) I like that you crisp the chicken first before adding the sauce. I would assume the chicken would have a nice crispiness to it by frying it first....
All your dishes always looks soooo delicious!!! What brand of salt and sugar do you use in your cooking???
ngon qua chi oi, so good
Been watching a few videos now and could not just NOT subscribe to your channel! Can't wait to make these recipes at home!! I'm hoping to visit Korea one day and eat the authentic food. But for now, your recipes will do the trick :D

what can I use to substitute fish sauce
awww heavenly. Gonna try this recipe soon
How come the chicken was not season before frying them, I know the fish sauce is salty but the meat still needs to be seasoned a little....

I love this chick. You can see she loves her food haha. You can relate to her more as a regular everyday person than some TV cooking show hosts. Keep it up girl. I am about to try this for my gf tonite.

i loved this recipe. one of few where i iked the recipe as is, with no alterations. :) yum! thanks for sharing
Planning to make this tomorrow for my fiancé and brother 😊 Hopefully I can find lemongrass when I go shopping today! So excited to try it!
I'm from Vietnam. I'm super happy because you've done a very delicious dish. This is an absolutely unique chicken dish in most Vietnamese families. And  we often add some more turmeric. Hope that you'll try it and know what exactly we feel about this dish.
Looks really great
trying this tomorrow for lunch! woooo hoooo i'm excited!
I saw this today and got so excited I cooked this dish for dinner! it was sooo good!!
I finally made this today (with new lemongrass) and it has made me embarrass myself. It's so good, I can't get it to the plate. I was just spooning it into my mouth from the pan. It's delicious!! I need to find a way to save some for lunch.
Just did this recipe tonight.  Had to use chicken breast because that is what was in the fridge, but followed the rest to the letter and turned out great.  Sharing with my mom for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for the lesson!
be honest, I'm Vietnamese anh I feel like you can cook Vietnamese dishes better than me =))) haha this is one of my favorite dishes =))) in Vietnam, we have soybean sauce. I don't know whether it is similar to Korean soybean paste or not but chicken+soybean sauce+ginger+spice... wow~~~ my mouth is watering =)))
I love your recipes and you present them with such love happiness and perfection!! 💕💕
Great recipe, Seonkyoung!  Easy to make and, most of all, delicious!
Yummy
I tried this dish today. Instead of chicken thighs I used chicken wings, and I would cut them into pieces. Stir-deep fry until it's cooked and I added the ingredients. I almost opt out of the Thai chili and cilantro, but then I am a big fan of cilantrol so no can do with this dish. The taste was amazing! I loved it!! I had been cooking lemongrass with pork and same ingredients except I added hoision sauce and oyster sauce to mine but then I always wanted to opt out the oyster sauce and hoision sauce. So here is this dish without all those major sauce in it!
oh yes thats looks goooodddd!
Nuna so pretty I wanna your food and hug you xD
What is the yield portion for this recipe; 2 People?
Crap! I was just at the Asian market (waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay across town) today and I looked at the Lemongrass and thought, "Nope. Won't need it." Now i need it!
Your recipe looks divine.It might be benificial to viewers to tell them where they coud acquire lemongrass.? for this recipe.
What sauce was added after the fish sauce mixture?

wow..i'm Vietnamese~~ Thank you for introducing my country's cuisine <3 I love chicken so I'll definitely try to make it!!!
I love ur wooden spoon! Thanks for sharing i am going to make this for dinner tomorrow! We grow fresh lemongrass so this will be a really easy recipe to make!
This is a very easy recipe
they should've given you your own show at food network :) I love you seonkyoung!
I live in Japan and I don't think I've ever seen lemongrass. Would it still be good with leeks instead? Although it wouldn't be lemongrass chicken anymore :(
Yaaasss it looks so good. Omg
This looks so good and seems pretty easy to make, but mine never turn out as good as yours look. Finally.....You're so close to the 100k sub mark!
Yum!!!!
About how many tablespoons of lemon grass was that?
That looks so good. We are still waiting for our Korean Home Fries!
OMG!!!! that looks crazy good. You  always make me hungry when i watch your videos Lol, this is my kind of meal. I wanted to marinate the chicken in the lemongrass ,garlic & chili, Can i marinate in the fish sauce mix you made also? & how long can i marinate for. I would appreciate it. & thank you for sharing. :)
Thanks 🙌👏!!
this video is making me sooooo hungry right now....
Just being nosy.  I wonder why Seonkyoung only wears an engagement ring when she's married?
does this taste sweet?
That looks soooo good! Thanks for sharing, I might try it for dinner tonight =]
that looks so delicious!!
You made me lick my lips as I'm drinking tea and juice fasting XP
That looks delicious!
Wow looks amazing!! Would the fish souse makes the chicken smells or tastes like a fish?
Seonkyoung, that Vietnamese Lemongrass Chicken looks so mouthwatering. You really outdone yourself. Maybe someday, you should make a companion cookbook with stunning visuals of your amazing dishes from Asia. I appreciate it. Byron. :-)
I'm Vietnamese and your recipe is on point! Thanks! Btw, what brand is that pan?
First again? Woot again!
