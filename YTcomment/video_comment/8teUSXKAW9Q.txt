You did fine. And you're right, you didn't bleach your hair. You used color and developer, which is not bleach! I've been licensed over twenty years.
Nice 👍🏼 for not using bleach it looks awesome 👏
I have permanent color hair dye in my hair. I wanna make my hair lighter. How do I go about doing that to a lighter color hair dye? What do I need to do
I mean if you have virgin hair it’s obvious you don’t need bleach
not much of a tutorial or guide.
Nicer!!
used vitamin C Tablets, baking soda, dish soap, and Anti dandruff shampoo... mixed it all up together no measurements just winged it... I let it sit for about 1½ hrs they say 1 hr but my hair is fine... Use a deep conditioner afterwords...  *IM IMPRESSED WITH IT!!! 😃 2👍👍  ********IT WORKS FRFR!!!*********  *IT LIGHTED CHARCOAL BLUE BLACK PERMANENT HAIR DYE TO A DARK BROWN  *** I'm gonna do it again in about a week and I should be back to normal almost
Very pretty
Thanks!
So she didn’t bleach it even healthier wow that’s incredible
Did your roots go lighter than thr rest?
I am suprised a Golden blonde was selected.  For virgin darker hair woulnt it make sense to use a ash blojde to couhter act the natuarl reds in dark hair? Indont think thsi eill work for most
Ok so I tried light ash blonde dye because I had dyed my light brown hair too dark. It works perfectly. Just use an ashy shade and keep roots for last to avoid hot roots. Hot roots look really bad. Keep the roots for the final 5-10 minutes.
Would it work on box dyed hair too? Has anyone with box dye hair tried it?
Doesn’t look there anything in hair…. 😮Should have changed colour while wrapped under threat plastic…. Should show while she applying colour
My hair is dark brown and I desperately want to dye it red! Do you think dying it twice can can catch the wine red? My hair is virgin
Was it natural black or is it dyed?
I didn’t really like my dark hair and I rlly want blonde hair but it would cause so much damage because my hair is VERY dark
😍😍😍😍😍😍
What shade did you use ?
Hi Rebecca you have done really well definitely lighter sweety I’ve got very dark brown dyed hair eventually going back blonde but not bright blonde thanks for this video
why in gods name wouldn't you put what it was that you put in your hair to do this .
Those box hair dye has bleach to mix with the colour
Came out beautiful! Love it
Beautiful color
We used to do this back in the day
no fucking way
Do they still sell this color?  I can’t find it online.
Think if u used all it would be light hun x
Broo I wish I had virgin hair like you too
The bruh moment when you realize her hair is virgin & not 7 times black box dyed like yours😁😁🤣
Was the hair virgin before or previously darkened
Was this dyed on your natural hair color?
I died my hair dark brown do you think this would work?
In a box of what Please explain what your using under the cap
How long did you leave the dye in for?  Thanks
I been doing this for years.  Hairdresser don’t want to risk it potentially “damage “ your hair, so it means you need to return back to achieve your desired colour, so for them it’s more 💴  So I started lighting my hair this way and she has less work to do and it costs me less 🤷🏻‍♀️win win
I can’t understand what she used? I saw 110 but the other tube I could not catch?
Omggg you just saved me a ton of money!! I'm so happy I stumbled upon this, exactly the colour I wanted
But it doesn't work if you have black hair dyed right?
Love this color on you. It looks beautiful.
Thank you
My hair is dark to the point it looks black
How’s your hair texture? Is your dark hair natural?
Very good young lady.. job  well done
Loving the k flay outro 💜
Did this yesterday. I have naturally dark brown/black hair and it ended up looking like yours. Can’t wait to use one more box in a months time!
Man. I wanted to see all the hair a lil further back.
I would've used an ashy tone to avoid the reddish result
That's how I used to change my hair from black to auburn in my 20's and I'm 55 now
Sorry but nothing you do at home can beat a professional. Always pay up for top results
If you have red pigment in your brown hair, is it still possible to do this without ruining the hairs colour?
Heather feather?
Did you use developer? 30?
You’re cute
will this work on black box dye?
THANKS
Suits u way more than dark
Wow 👏🏼
does it change your black hair to brown?
It didn't work for me
You didn’t say what you used!!!! That would help....
This is lie!!! Don’t do it
That’s amazing. I would have never imagined a box dye would create that result. Thanks for the demo.
So can you tell me everything you used please?
I only started dyeing my hair last year, and have only had it done twice now. I am due in for the next appointment in about one week. I keep asking the hairdresser if she can make my hair a little lighter without bleach - she says no. This makes me unhappy. I have dark hair too, and all I end up with is a reddish brown tinge to it after the hairdresser is done with it. Should I be trying this Ash Blonde idea? Please help...
Omg your the sister of Selena Gomez!!
Nope! It definitely looks like you had to use the 2nd bottle in order to get it as light as it looks on your video cover. I didn't watch the video to the very end but if you did use 2 bottles I hope you mentioned that because 1 bottle didn't do that much!
Will definitely do this. I have black hair, and want a change
What did u use?
My hair is dyed dark brown, what do I need to do to achieve this color?
Where can I  buy this dye!??
It's a big lie. This does not work. I tried it and it did not work. Stop lying to people just to get ratings.
Does this work on black hair
New subscriber!
How long did you let it stay in your hair?
It’s going to be 4 years tomorrow, wow.
There is bleach in blonde box dyes ya know lol
Hi Rebecca. I know this video was posted a while ago, however it's my understanding that you only did this 3 times and stopped. Was the color too drying, fading quickly or just too much hassle for you personally? I am wondering if you just touched up the roots as needed if it would prevent damage/ dry out long term. Curious on your personal experience with this. Thanks for your time.
Looks good!
I had bleached hair which i dyed black then i used colour remover and my hair went ginger and then i dyed it brown and it turned black again
Hi I NEED HELP I have virgin black hair and I want to color only my ends brown. So, I am thinking of buying ash blonde like you. I loved your video! Do you think it will suit me? I am scared if my hair will be frizzy or if it will suit. Please help if you can.
Bro she didnt even show us how she applied it so wht is the actual point of this video
Really great idea!   I’m blue back, but should be med honey brown .. great video! 👏💯
I'm to scared to do this I just dyed my hair and it went  red...I have dark brown almost looks black....want to lighten it.
You look like heather feather so much. She might be a long lost sister
Has anyone ever told you you look similar to heather feather asmr
But did you have virgin dark hair or dyed?
There ‘Was’ bleach in what you used ... or it wouldn’t have lightened ... & you’re lucky it didn’t turn out bad.
Guys I think that's not the same person In the thumbnail I'm not quite sure its actually her!
May I ask what is the oxidizer volume you used with this? TIA 😊
Does henna counts as a hair dye?
Nice channel keep it up
Super result!
Hair Rule 101 - Color does not correct color
Looks really nice on you!
What that your natural color or dyed brown hair?
It turned out great
Color name plz
Plz do it naturally
Virgin hair will do this, but not pre-colored hair unless you use a toner & additive IMO (from personal experience)
I bought the same box and it worked for me!!! I have very dark brown close to the color black and my hair is in a soft brown color😍(: It’s worth buying it. Trust me. OOOh.. just so you know, if you are going to buy it, I want to warn you that the smell of the chemicals can be strong plus it can irritate your eyes, even if the product is 3 inches away from your eyes, it can still be bothersome.
Wow I like it !!
I wish you luck!
I really love it and looks good on u !!!
4:00 Her hair is virgin dark hair, not black box dyed.
I dyed my hair dark brown 6 months ago with a box so if I use this L’Oréal dye on my hair will it show?
so i naturally have black hair but i have blonde highlights in my hair as of now and i’m kinda nervous to try any dye in it idk what it will do😅
Depends with the type of hair. I used 30 volume of bleach for 45 mins and didnt even  lighten a little. I have a very thick black hair and its súper stubborn.
looks good! I mad the mistake of doing this......with already dyed hair....I had 3inches of virgin roots so as you can imagine.....i ended up with super light roots and dark for the rest of my head lmao ooops
Thank you for your video ......I show it to people that want to lift their hair w/o bleach .....very smart ideal.....very safe considering most don't know that much about hair color.....very effective and very inexpensive.....thank you for your video.....you've saved 5 women I know personally from bleach disasters .....
I have dyed my hair black for many years and now i want to go dark brown..would this work for me? Or do i need to use bleach in order to go lighter?
Does anyone know if you can dye the finished(lightened) product another color afterwards? I'm trying to to lighten for coloring. Thanks 😊
It suits you the new colour.
Pro tip: You should not generally use plastic wrap after applying hair dye. That's because it will concentrate the heat at your scalp and overdevelop the roots. This can cause "hot roots", ie. roots that are lighter than the rest of your hair.
Does this work when your hair is dyed black or dyed dark red?
I did this with a wella color touch dye that was a very light ash pearl blonde with almost blue undertones and it came out a gorgeous medium ash brown.
This is soo beautiful 😍 I really want do this colour . I don’t want to do any red type brown. I hope this with give me a ash brown colour ❤️
Bull instructions
I have virgin dark brown hair and just dyed it with a light ash brown box dye and didn't get as light as I wanted. Would I be able to dye it again with a lighter box dye color or should I use the same light ash brown color to go lighter?
Look great 👍
where can i get this in the UK?
It's virgen hair of course it dyed perfectly natural...
Would this color change look good with darker skin?
Wait so did you only use one box?
so patchy?
For me it doesn't work 😔
Is ur hair still soft ??
Does anyone know the after care for your hair after doing this ? What products do I need and like what do I have to do ?
Brad mondo is shook lol It looks really nice tho!! 🥰🥰
she keeps saying ummmm
Where did you buy it and what one do you recommend for natural black hair? X
eek im lucky my hair is the same colour as after you dyed your hair
You’re so pretty 😍
What if I used dark ash blonde instead of light ash blonde? Would it turn out darker or not lighten anything at all on my black hair?
Thank you for this! Do you think it will work if I try coloring my hair violet or another color after doing this step as a lightening on my black hair?
Definitely one step
P
Ok my mom has been a hair dresser for 37 years . There is lifting power in these colers witch is bleach.  So its bleach . Sorry
I’m Rebecca too
So your hair never been dyed before that’s prolly why the color also came out! I haven’t dyed my hair for 2 years but I used to dye it black or blue black now seems that it faded out a lot I wanted like a nice level 4 or 5 brown
Instructions unclear my hair is currently falling off right now
My hair r so dark i hate it :(
Beautiful Caramel!
great
I think the final look is amazing with your skin.
did you leave it in for longer than 25 mins since your hair is darker?
sorry but it;s hard to believe that You did it by yourself...
Oooh  I really like the way the color came out. About to try this. Hopefully I don't end up bald.
You look like a young Ariana Grande from her Nickelodeon days!
I have black/brown hair but I want it to be a lighter brown so I get a dark/lighter brown which box dye should i use
I think it turned out nice for first lightening.  Bravo for going for a change!
What will be result if I use grey hairdye on my black hair without bleaching
I think the colour turned out very nice!
I can't find the dye you used which shade can I use instead?
So freaky MY NAME IS REBECCA GOMEZ TOO!!!!!! BUT MY MARRIED LAST NAME IS MANSOUR 😂
Did your hair get weak after this
What color of dye did I use. Would b nice to know!
my friend has naturally black hair and she used blonde dye to make her hair brown. i have dyed black hair that has faded after washing it for the past 7 months. it’s still black but i was wondering if i could lighten it using ash blonde dye?
If you ever plan to get your hair bleached, this is not the method to do it. Your hair might smoke off if you ever use bleach in the future. Anyone watching this, if you want the same results she got without bleach and want to go lighter in the future, buy a small bottle of volume 30 developer in liquid form, generic is fine, and one box of Wella T18. Its going to cost you the same price as this box of hair dye. Wella T18 IS meant for pale blonde hair, but you can permanently lighten your very dark hair with this method, and your hair won’t fall off if you decide to go to a salon for highlights later down the road.
Does it work on dyed hair?🤔 I dyed my hair really really really DARK brown before
does it just come without bleach? please respond
please make step by step
i died my hair black last night biggest mistake ever! Can i put ash blonde in today and it be lifted? i just dont want to go green
Do u have color on your dark hair?
Except it has bleach in it.
Hello. Was your hair already tinted dark??
I don't know if you mentioned this, but did you do your roots first or last?
I nearly bleached my hair in bored yesterday. I might try this way instead. I'm so bored 😩😩😩
This is EXACTLY the video I was looking for thank you mwah!
Omg THAT HAS BLEACH IN IT ffs🤦🏻‍♀️
You can lighten your virgin hair without bleach but tint doesn’t lift tint. Once you’ve dyed your hair, trying to lighten it with any colour will not lighten it. You have to use bleach to remove the pigment of tint ☺️ think about it like this.. when you have virgin hair and you use a tint to lift the hair you require a stronger peroxide to open the hair cuticle enough and the colour will lighten the natural pigment that is already there. If you add tint into the hair, you are adding additional pigment and would require bleach to move it again as bleach literally just removes pigment. That’s why this colour turned out so nice because she affectively lightened and toned in one step. People who bleach their hair and are disappointed with the results are just removing the brown and black pigments initially and are left with yellow and red hence the orange hair. You either need to lighten your hair further which I’d recommend you get a professional to do for you for the sake of your hair or dye it one shade darker with a blue (if orange) or purple (if yellow) based toner/colour in order to cancel out any warmth. Sometimes it’s better to embrace the warmth than try to fight it! Hope this helps somebody ☺️
Can you add another dye to your hair after this? I want to go a sort of ash purple colour from natural black but I don’t want to bleach it. I was thinking if I do this then add a lightish purple dye over top then it would give the brown hair a slight purple tint? Idk if it will work tho lol
Does this also work for guys with shorter hair? I have black hair but I'd like to go to a light to medium brown :)
i don’t know if you’ll answer this but if i wanted to put color on after i did this to my hair how long should i wait?
My hairdresser does this to me too! With quarantine going on I need to figure out how to cut and would like to do this ot my hair too
3:15 song?
Did the roots (when new hair grew) were really noticable or did it blend in good? I dont want to dye my roots every month..
Does it work in dyed hair?
Your hair colour turned out amazing btw
I’ve got dyed hair. It’s naturally black. It’s brown in the sun and with the brown dye it’s more brown in the sun. I want lighter brown hair which shows even without the sun. I hope it works on non virgin hair
My favorite color ! I have black hair, which color should i buy ? Thks, this color perfect on you . .
I have medium brown hair. It looks kind of red in the sun. I wonder what my hair will turn out like
Do they still make this color? I can’t seem to find it.
Can we just talk about how much this girl looks like Heather Feather
Which colour did u use??
🔥🔥🔥🔥
OMG your hair looks amazing! I really want to dye my hair at home, and I was wondering if you used the blonde sort of colour on your hair?
👍
Here's to all those who say you cannot lighten dark hair with blonde hair color. You can.
It's better if you showed us the procesures I mean the steps ..you start with ends or roots ?
Instead of a bad should I use tin foil instead so it can come out more brown?
I did this tonight!!  I used the same brand and color as her and it dyed my hair orange. Not only that but my roots are lighter than the rest like hers are. So my roots are very orange. I also had dark brown/black virgin hair.
Like a very warm red brown  nice
sister , what shampoo you use ?
Ok I’ve virgin hair I haven’t dye my hair in maybe 4 months I’ve Grey hair now 😂 I’m gonna try this I’m buying the same box my hair is not super dark as yours but let’s see if it works in Latino hair 😝 you said 35 minutes on ??? Right
It’s uneven . 😊
I just did this on straight asian black hair Lol. my top is so light. It's more like a doo doo brown than the subtle brown i'd like but if I were to do it again, less emphasis on the top of my heads. Thank you for this though 1
Yes its got peroxide in it 🤣..plus you have virgin hair...
She said “ it was LIKE virgin hair , not that it was virgin hair
Thanks so much! Just what I was looking for! U helped me decide to go ahead and do it! 👍🏼
The color is super beautiful
Can i leave dye for bit longer?
Random question but what is your lipstick shade? Love it! :)

I have done highlights on my natural hair than I done it again but just on top of my hair and I was blonde like that for some time... than I wanted darker so I died my hair brown but highlights become green... I was shock I imidiatly bought number 3 hair diy and I was black! Than I bought vit c and head and shoulders and put it on my hair to remove color… I have removed some of it than I was breasy and by number 5 hair color diy in hope I would become brunette. I became some non defined color black.. I didn't like it at all.. I was crying. than I bought vit c again and do the procedure and it left my hair red! I was red. than I finally go to hair salon because I don't know what to do and she did me highlights and rest of hair died number 5 again and of course than I didn't like it. because again i was number 5... so i want to be brunette. should I buy the lightes blond dye and go over black or should i buy color remover and remove black of hair and than go with some color and wich? and if i remove black and left with red and i do lightest blonde over it wich color i will get????
Beautiful💃❤Is your hair natural black ?
GIIRL,  you should always shampoo your colour out!!!
My hair is also black so does this work for all color by this brand
What does Virgin mean?
Where did you get the product from? And did everything come in the box with it?
Colour name plz
This is great and such a good cheat short cut!  It looks so good.  Why are people so triggered over this? 😂

You look so nice with that new colour
Guys I need help. I have recently box dyed my hair dark brown and it turned out black. I want to turn in dark brown but I don't know how to. Can someone help
Is your hair naturally black?
Whoa, you look awesome! I think I'm going to try this but I kind of want to do like a purple after I lighten it. Can I do it right after? Or should I wait a few days?
ALGUEM  SABE COMO CLAREAR CABELOS QUE FICARAM NEGROS DEVIDO A PINTURA  , Por Favor ...?   Gratidao.
I’m going to try this. You look gorgeous🌸
Does anyone know what happens if you put box dye over previously box dyed hair?? I would use the exact same color and everything
i like that hair color
You look a teeny bit like Nina dobrev..I think it’s your eyes and lips
The title says " diy " tho
pointless ass video
That is an extremely good idea I love the colour I have dead black hair
Trying this today, my hair is a slut by the way 😂
What shade did she go with
you did great but dont you think the undertone is still quite warm? its not brassy but still quite warm toned.
Would this work on dyed dark brown hair I hate it and rlly want to get my hair lighter xx
I just dyed my hair from dark brown to light but idk if it took :(
Looks light it has highlights in it as well.
But the colour you had before is your natural colour.
I will try this method using a cap to give my hair natural highlights without bleach! Thanks for the tutorial!
How long did you leave the dye in, before you rinsed your hair?
It's too close to see it well
I hope to get the same color cuz I try turning from black to brown looks like red brown  I love black color but i need to do sth new broke the routine so hopefully  to get the same result like you.
So if I apply blonde on dark brown hair it will change the color?
Wow!! Your hair was black and now it's a pretty light brown color! I honestly want to do this but I gotta cut all the dye out of my hair first. My hair is naturally black, went to a hairstylist and they did a shit job putting highlights in, and so I dyed it back to black. But this method looks simple enough!
How long did you wait before rinsing?
Beautiful!!!
My virgin roots are about 5 or 6 inches out and i haven’t dyed my hair in about 1.5 years, Would this work on me?
Thank you so much for posting this. I've been wanting to lighten my hair for a while, but I dont want to ruin my curls.🤗If it's not to much to ask, could  you plz tell me if this is permanent. Btw, thanks again your the real mvp.😎

What do you do when the roots grow out ? I am thinking about doing it
"Okay, guys. So ... Yeah! So ... Okay. Yeah!"
Who came to the comments section to see if it was true ??
if you did it for 30-35 or 40  minutes maybe it would have came out blond
2:21 I F*CKING HAET  WEN PEOPLE DO THAT
Una pregunta tu cabello era virgen obtenía color antes ?
Someone please tell me the name of the background music playing 3:59 onwards
would this work on dyed black hair
This is semi permanent
I'm a Male with natural black hair aiming for light Brown tired of the heat
Just love it🎀💝
No show of how did you apply?!👎🏻👎🏻
Hii I got a question, can you use the color dark ash blonde to dye your hair from black to brown?
You were not help at all. You did not answer the question that you gave in the title of your video… Waste of my four minutes
You can put vaseline around your hairline, on your ears, and I put it on my shoulders and neck, as Vaseline is a barrier cream, it stops any hair dye going on your skin, especially if it's a dark colour your using, otherwise you end up having to scrub your skin with bicarbonate of soda lol as you will notice I learned the hard way lol, and it's great well done
was your hair dyed black or was it natural black?
1 step we could not even watch///
I did this and I have dark brown hair and my hair came out a pretty honey brown
So I bought a L’Oréal hair dye 70 medium ash black and instead of lightening it actually took my hair to its original color black
Wow what a cool technique! Question, now that you have dyed it and it's no longer virgin hair, are you going to be able to use this method again in the future to maintain it?  Does anyone know the answer to this because I want to try it out too
Hey just check the description! Xoxo
Hi can I ask what hair color did you use for your hair? Because it is gorgeous and I wanna try it to for my upcoming graduation. Thanks for reply.😊
Very wel and thanks alot. I have black hair and dyed 10x with different clolors to get it light brown. Did not knew that you must use alot lighter color on black hair to get it brown or light brown. Even though 1st i used something to get rid of all colors used before. Then i bought the same brand as you and same strentgh and thats it. Now i have light brown hair and it looks great. Thanks.
you schuld mention that your hair is virgin!! that's very important information for someone that wants to use same product!!
It looks great! I have dark brown hair and have tried lightening my hair the very same way you did but, I have a lot of red highlights in my hair so, naturally, my hair turns red rather than a lighter brown. I hate when it does that. 😒
Wake up! All the dye box have bleach
You didn't show how you applied it.
Very bad
You said you're not an expert.. but you did an amazing job thank you for posting this👍❤
developer is bleach
Was your hair Virgin
Of course it has bleach aka developer. Either way it looks good
So you lightened your hair...and your skin got darker?? Your cover pic...
Looks amazing, I'm inspired.
SUNSET LOVER 💕💕💕💕  my fav song ever
It actually looks great on you n lift upped your face more.
You did fine. And you're right, you didn't bleach your hair. You used color and developer, which is not bleach! I've been licensed over twenty years.
Whats the music she uses at the end?
You look like Ariana Grande 😭😍
I have dark brown hair not that dark not that light , kinda reddish also... I want to ombre light brown to lighter brown (root to end) how can I achieve that at home ?? Plz help me🙏🙏🙏
How long are we supposed to keep it on ??? I have on rn
Works for beard hair?
Haha no bleach!!!! Just wait till her hair starts falling out....
Useless
I love it soooo much!! Exact color I want! Does your hair feel dry after dying? I’m going to Walmart asap to pick up the box 😍
what this hair colour name???i don't understand
i am NOT dying my dark almost black hair blonde.. especially with my skin colour
I love this color !
I got that hair colour without dye. but im going try dye my hair pink without bleach
Next summer, I’m going to donate my hair and my hair will be short. After that I’m going to use your technique to lighten my hair!! I’m so excited! Can’t wait til summer
When she dyed her hair the first time,the colour is the same as my natural hair colour.
Need help I colored my hair black I don’t like it but I want to medium brown how should I do it please help I watch your video it kind a help me to thank you and the other notes from Dr. Brown
Ooh I might try this on my hair because I want to lighten it but I don't want to completely bleach it, I just want it to be a shade or 2 lighter than it is now, plus this is probably a lot less damaging.
Yes, when I was a teen, I dyed my virgin hair with blonde. It lifted a lot of color. Wondering, though, if this will work on hair that has been dyed black? It's faded and you can see some lighter brown hairs. Anyone try it on non-virgin hair?
Developer = hydrogen peroxide = bleach
I did this and my hair came out red 😭        I have really natural dark hair it’s pitch black, and I wanted it to be dark brown lol
how does it look like in the sun?
I also have really dark brown hair, and have always wanted it to be lighter. I recently picked up some box dye from Garnier, and the color on the box was ginger red. I tried it and it looks great. Like in the video, it's not that big a difference in the dark (althought still noticeble), but it looks amazing in the sun. The damage was minimal.
so like basically if you wanna dye your hair brown and your hair is THAT BLACK , you will have to go with a 5x lighter shade. So u wont have to use bleach
Lol that my hair color right now and I want it lighter 😂
OMG it looks so beautiful and so natural on you!!!
You are the best! Thank you for this awesome tip. My previous colour was like your new colour and I dyed my hair dark brown...I followed your suggestions and my previous colour is back!
I want to dye my hair with ash gray or gray. But i don't want to bleach my hair. Help me
BRUH I WAS BORN WITH BACK AND BROWN HAIR AND I’M THE IONLY ONE IN MY FAMILY WHO HAS BACK AND BROWN HAIR AND PEOPLE THINK THAT I DYED MY HAIR
What brand of light ash blonde did you use? So with the brand of your purple shampoo?
I'll try this after I wash out the maroon/ brown hair colour I currently have-; with sunlight dish detergent bc I heard that it helps remove it better , also im from Toronto too!! And I just followed you on ig lmao, awesome video!! xx Adriana
You didnt show what the products are called...😑😞 I have virgin hair also.. the same as yours was.
LOL your hair is virgin . okay clickbait haha
If I do this with golden blonde hair will it turn ash blonde or more blonde at all?
thx, u help me a lot:)
Box dye has bleach in it
Gosh! waste of time to watch.
She has stated that she is aware that there is some bleach in the dye but it's less damaging than going straight bleach. For those that are quick to give advice listen before you do it.
WHATS THE SONG IN THE BACKGROUND???
http://moneyin.online/?do=23348
How awesome that is what I am trying to achieve. You look amazing in both colors!
K.FLAY!!
Color looks gorgeous ❤️
Just dyed my hair with actual brown dye, nothing really happened looks the same. Is it possible to do it like the or same day but I get the blonde dye to actually achieve brown hair?
How long did it last? Is your hair being bleached technically to that color or is it being dyed to that color? Or both?
Bleaching is different and  peroxide is different. Peroxide will makes hair lighter for certain levels.but bleach takes all of the melanin from your hair.
I also have black hair and I don't know what blonde dye you used but I did this twice with two different blonde dye boxes and my hair just turned orange lmao
it looks so good omfg
This was so helpful! Thanks!!!
Bad vidio
Which collar blond did you use please? It turn out very beautiful for you the lighter brown. Well done and thank you.💕👻
Your soo pretty I’m a fan now 💕
Why don’t you just dye it brown since your using dye🤦🏽‍♀️
That’s how mine was supposed to turn out😂😂😂 I made a video on my channel using this method too! Mine didn’t turn out as good as yours though!! Good job :)))
Can you try the platinum blonde please?
Is it Permanent?
dyeing your hair at all can damage it. take it from me. started dyeing my hair when i was 12 and now im almost 16. have had lighter brown, bleach blonde, dirty blonde, red, blonde again, pink (which had to be bleached several times because i had let my naturally dark brown hair grow out), blue, dark brown to cover the blue for school, and now blue again. my hair has gone through HELL. after i dyed it back to brown for school, i bought tresemmé hair masks to repair it and used it 2 times a week. my hair was extremely healthy for about a year until i dyed it blue again recently.     all i'm saying is, i really regret losing my undamaged hair, but i do enjoy getting it colored. so please make sure you are 100% positive that this is what you want.
How long did she leave it on for?!
The product still has bleach in it though.
How it to turn with make up .I'm just here for ur dye hair
I dyed my hair purple but it came out green. Please help what do I do?!?!
Was ur hair died black before? Or was that black ur natural color
You should have tried color oops 1st then dyed it
By black hair do you mean it was dyed black? Thanks for the video btw x
how did you get rid of the orange tint that naturally dark hair goes when you lighten it? did you use a toner?
what song is this
Would this work on hair that’s dyed black? X
Now u look so modern
It turned out really nice. ❤️
You should not wrap the died hair . it is better to leave it develop with oxygen
I am scare to die my hair lighter because I have lapeshai
just u use good quality honey, (can get good strong quality honey in a health food store). this will lighten your hair, like this also naturally without the chemicals.
Love it my hair came out the same thanks😍😍😍😍😍
ok so your hair is virgin dark coloured and you used a golden blonde dye, which turned your hair into some sort of light brown hair. So it better do the same to me XD
It didn't make your hair dry?
Was your hair dyed black or natural black?
Girl I love how your hair turns brown when sun hits, it looks magical.
orange hair  !!! sorry the bleach is very important when we want a light color
This is good.  When younger I went to a hair dresser and spent $$$$ for lighting my hair. And he just did what you did. He put blonde on my hair and it lightened.  Good Job!
Will it turn grey hair into same color.... I have black hairs and grey hairs some.... Please reply
Wow looks great !!!! Ill see if i cant grab a box of that if my current situation doesnt do much lighting
Tried this today and it didn’t work
You know you look almost exactly like coco grayson the actress in this video
Love k.flay
Please answer my question....My hair is dyed colour ( dark brown almost black like) When I colour my hair only the roots gets coloured please can anyone suggest what I need to do to get it evenly distributed. I want to go slightly lighter like light brown. Thanks
How long did the color last? Did it damage your hair?
Bruh... we have the same name! Gomez is my maiden name 🤗
You have to start 2 inches from the roots. The heat from your head process the hair faster. That is why it is lighter on the roots or ends. Always start 2 inches from the scalp and take move down until about an inch or 2 from the ends depending how dry your ends are. Then do the roots. The last 5 minutes come through to the ends.
What colour did you use? You said you used light ash blonde but on the video it say you used the colour Helsinki ? Abit confused
I need to try this
@Rebecca : how long did u have the black on your hair before u did this?
Don't be stupid, people. Of course she meant without bleach powder. Just a dumb person would not undetstand such thing
could you keep dying it multiple times to get blonde?
Loreal preference does have agents the bleach your hair, even if it technically says no bleach. It will also eventually damage it and break it with extended use. I'm currently regrowing mine after about 10 years of use of the product. I started losing hair rapidly due to breakage.
What lipstick are you wearing in your reveal? It's super cute!!
So if I have black hair I have to buy a blond color dye to make my hair brown?...
Cam we use this without bleaching  hair?
I love it !!!!
I'm going to be trying this hair dye soon. Its so hard to get hold of for some reason I don't know why but I have managed to find it at Superdrug in the UK. My hair is naturally black and I have a caramel brown balayage at the ends. Hope this works for me I want my hair colour exactly like yours! I love it xxx
Yeah, but your hair was dyed black before or its natural dark..?? Theres a diff...
How long did you leave it on? My hair is dark dark brown right now and I would like it the color you have now.
how do you upkeep with roots growing in?
How ling did this last before you had to re dye it?
Love it!!!😘
My natural hair color is similar to yours and I just dyed mine for the first time hoping to get the same results. Unfortunately, I used "Light Brown" (L'oreal Preference #6) and it made almost no difference. I guess I need to try a blonde color or even bleach it first.
Wait is this not Heather feather
Just use  the brightest blonde dye (Plantinum) Itll work 😂Trust mee
How  if you color your hair black before and you want to change color a blonde color ?
My hair is naturally black but I dyed it red (no bleach just dye so my hair is still dark) if I used this method, would my hair go brown or would it go a different colour?
I did the exact same thing on my virgin dark drown hair but it came out wayyyy lighter. Curious to see what it'll look like the second time around!
one question was the black you had  on  box dye or natural ?(please respond)
Omg get a nose job please, your honestly rlly ugly😑
What song was playing in the background at 3:41?
Has anyone ever told you , you like like heather feather
love that so much
Look's great nice video
You are fortunate that your hair did not turn ORANGE.
Gloves??? No mention about wearing gloves...and no mention about what brand and number of Color you used :(
You look like heather feather!
Will this work on hair that has already been dyed before?
In the thumbnail u looked like heather feather
So to get that colour, should I buy a blonde colour set, and not a brown one?
Hi rebecca, I have naturally black hair but was wanting to go dark brown, do you think this product would change it as I'm not sure if your hair was naturally black?
It looks good
Looking gorgeous :)
My hair is naturally black, but ash blonde garnier dye, only makes my hair  a dark brown..it mostly shows in the light. I wish my hair was lighter.
First, great video! I really want to dye my hair but my natural color is medium-dark brown, like a 2 or 3 on the brown hair color scale. I definitely want to lighten my hair but I'm scared that if I got the really light color you did, it might be a bit too light. Would you recommend a slightly darker blonde tint for my natural color?
Hey,  does the hair color start to was off or turn into another color after a few months?   Thank you!
dude seriously, nice of you to make a video but next time you REALLY don't have to go into so much detail and repeat yourself 20 fucking times while starting at yourself in your photobooth video... you just made my internet mega fucking lag JUST TO REDESCRIBE WHAT YOU HAD ALREADY SAID SO MANY TIMES holy shit.
Was you hair dyed black ?
Was wondering if your hair has grown out? Does it look weird with the black growing back into the light brown? Or do you re dye your roots as it grows in?? Ps love your outcome!!
Are u related to Selena gomez
Hi! I've looked everywhere to find the same hair dye you used but I can't find it anywhere:(( can you please link the product or is it only sold in Canada and not the us?
I want you to lighten it again tomorrow
I call bull shit
Can we have the exact product name you are using
will this work on  dyed hair?
She's hott as a brunette !!!
She's got that natural cute look
You look absolutely gorgeous with that colour!
Just when I thought I could lighten my dye black hair with your technique I got super excited, but then you said your hair was virgin hair....
So to go from black to light brown, I would have to buy blonde hair dye?
Purple shampoo wont work, it only works for yellow blonde hair
did you dye your hair black before or is your hair color naturally that dark?
So....about a year and a half ago, I dyed my hair with red streaks. I have JET BLACK hair so it only shows up when the sun reflects at a very presume angle 😂 I HATE MY FREAKING HAIR!!!
I think it turned out pretty good! it's not often you come across a DIY boxed hair dye that truly lightens on dark hair, by the way you are very beautiful!
Did it leave any brazzines? I want to lighten it to a light brown since i have dark hair but I'm so scared to end up with an orangy brown :( I have medium skin so it wouldn't look good , it always happens
What's the brand ? And what's color? Please I love this hair color
beautiful
I love how you actually respond to comments 😄😘
I love that new color !!! :D
This looks SO good on you! Can you tell me if my hair isn't dyed quite as dark as yours to begin with, would I use a blonde that strong to lighten it?
Really good video! - I should color my hair like yours. But why do you not use a light brown / golden color if it that's what you want and that's was your hair result? Why should we use a blonde color? I have dark brown hair and I'm really afraid about that my hair will be blond, but I also heard that if you have very dark hair you must use a bright color
It looks so good！ BTW, may I ask what colour is your lipstick？ It' s also so beautiful！
Would this work on dark thick coarse hair?
How long does it keep your hair light for ?
uuummmmmmm
I really liked this color but is it really bleach free. I have virgin black hair like you (but have more vol) n i love my hair😪 I don't wanna damage it
Loving your video!!! I finally found a way to dye my black hair. I'm gonna try it.
How many minutes did u leave it in for
Nice.
L'Oréal Hi Color for dark hair is used with a developer and safely lightens the hair. You can find it at Sally's Beauty supply. Hope this helps someone
name of the product PLEASE thanks :)
Will this work on dyed brown hair or natural brown hair only?
How long does dyed hair last
beautiful
I wanna do the same but I wanna keep it just for a month, how many time does it stay on your hair  ( or how many shampoo) ? Love ya video
did you dye over virgin hair or dyed
It's obvious that the product has some bleach but when she means "bleach" she means the whole complex steps of actually taking bleach and lightening your hair. Duh
Would this work on dyed dark hair? Or virgin dark hair only? :-(  xo
how long did you keep the dye in your hair for? :)
what's the song your playing at 3:35?
I need 3 boxes to dye my hair 😩
I just dyed my hair this same color same brand an all an it's very light because I had like a strawberry blonde hair color it's nice but did u use the purple shampoo if so what did it do???
did you ever use the purple shampoo if so did it help ur hair lighten?
I hate too tell you this, but this is using a bleach product even though you do not think it is bleach in the box, it is a cream bleach. I am a licensed cosmetologist. If it is lightening, it is bleaching... :) Developer is hydrogen peroxide and if it is lifting it is bleaching. That is a chemical. You might want to change your subtitle.
Did your hair feel slightly stringy? Or dry?
can be done. your hair is in better condition then when you started. looks amazing. are you doing it again. thank you. for the reply back. I'm in Australia you guys get heaps of. good toners over there and so cheap.  expensive here.  you look great 🤗
and they say you can't go lighter without bleach. well your proof it can and does.
your hair looks in great condition . I love the colour.  very pretty. think I'll try it myself
hydrogen peroxide is used to bleach hair (aka lighten, lift, strip etc). lighter  hair is  done by removing the melanin in it with hydrogen peroxide (aka bleaching it) anything that lightens your color is bleaching it. PERIOD. Coloring the hair is done by DEPOSIT in other words it is done by adding (the color) to the hair.  in order to get a lighter color on dark hair it needs to have the melanin removed by bleaching it then the  colors can be deposited onto the bleached hair.       a boxed hair color product that lightens your color is bleaching and coloring your hair at the same time.  no different than doing the two steps seperately. It is using the same processes.  it is not 'bleach' free.
Thanks for the vid! I do think that black suits you perfectly though!
This might be a dumb question but did you what more than half an hour and while you rinsed it out was your hair already a light brown color ? Thanks (I'm doing this and I haven't seen any change in my hair)
If I do this do you think I could dye my hair purple ? It's too black rn to pick up any dye
i love this! your outcome is so pretty.  i have very dark brown virgin hair as well, almost black. I want to make my hair 1 or 2 shades lighter than yours. how should i go about doing that? should i use extra light ash blonde instead of just light ash blonde? and dye it twice in a row? please help!
omg i thought she was heather feather
Lol hun, color doesn't lift color. Period. There was some bleach in the box color you bought. Almost all blonde hair dyes contain bleach. If it had no bleach, nothing would have happened to your hair.
so if u have black hair and use super blonde hair dye its gonna come out brown ?
so u jus put the die in ur hair and thats it
Hello! With this method what colour did your hair become? Light ash brown or medium ash brown ? Thanks :)
my hair is black. pitch black! I don't think any color would pick up but I don't want to bleach either. help me out please
it has bleach in it
does it turn brassy over time?
ok i have tried something which is quite helpful... i had very dark brown hair and they are really long! so i bought loreal excellence creme 9 and 2 developers with 30 volume. i didnt use the one given in the box. i mixed the developers and the color and applied on my hair..left them for and hour...and i got a light brown shade without bleaching...😉😉
I watched another vid of this product you used he had virgin blonde color and it turned to more bright blondy look . I have virgin black hair and i m afraid it won't turn to blond then ash brown.Should i try this?
tysm xoxo its suiting uh pretty girl
did u go lighter?
omg this gave me so much hope. my mom said i couldn't bleach my hair but i could always dye it. and i would be like howww bc my hair is a dark dark brown and i didn't think the color would pick up
how does it lift the color ?
Did you dye your hair right back to dark brown after I just started watching your other videos and I haven't seen this hair color in any other tutorial
wow! u look great in this hair color! can u pls tell us..which dye did u use?
is your hair still the same color as it was when you first dyed it?
Was your hair dyed before?
hey,  you are Becky G or not
Are you related to Selena Gomez?Not to be rude or anything.Just wondering because you have the last name Gomez.Anyway,keep doing what you do!Its fascinating!
Actually after using Sun in for two weeks my hair naturally got to that same color from black. I'm aiming for light light light brown hair, with a few strands of my black hair as highlights. I hope it won't look weird because I have dark skin so I hope it doesn't look bad.
great colour!  how long exactly did you leave it on? 25 or 30 min.  i need the exact time because as you know every Minute can change the tone of the colour
Your so pretty and the outcome was amazing💓 keep doing what you do x
It looks so beautiful on you :)
ah I'm getting this today and I'm so excited
how long did you leave it on?
I dyed my hair once with blonde dye (I had naturally black hair), my hair went ginger... Your hair is beautiful. So jealous
your hair was virgin?
If you left it longer it would have been lighter & use the second box. But it looks great
Did you start at your roots or your ends?? Also, how did you place the dye in your hair?? Love the vid!! Wanna try that this weekend :)
can you provide the link of the products.. please? im gonna try this coz your video is awesome.. thanks :D
Was your hair dyed black or virgin hair?
What color would your hair turn if u use the second box with your results atm?
Looks amazing! This is exactly the colour I want to lighten it to. Does it still look nice?
whoa this was such an awesome insightful vid. My hair extremely jet black. Darker than normal so ive always wanted to see how it was brown. It looks awesome on you!  hit up my channel if u like. I do hair vids as well
I <3 it!! :)
Have you colored your hair before?
Awesome xD
so pretty. it looks great on you
Lovely, give it a few more applications till summer (every 3-4 weeks) and you will have fantastic summer hair!  I have mid to light brown hair that goes red(ish) - wonder if this would make it go strawberry blonde for me :D Keep us updated if you feel like there is damage to your hair and how you battle against the damage. Thanks for the review! Much love <3
