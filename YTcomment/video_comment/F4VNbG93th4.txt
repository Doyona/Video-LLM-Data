Best recipe, thanks
Pls. Don't put those big letters n cover the face of the model we can't see how the way they put that strip
I ate this before at a filipino restaurant called Dampa. Thank you now I can cook this at home.
amazing recipe!
I can here that filipino accent in you yet you're forcing yourself to make your "pagkain pinoy" sound like you've spoke english your whole life 🤣 it sounds so awkward it's funny
You forget about the parsley 😜😂😂😂
Pwede bang walang parchment paper sa baking tray?
Oh, it looks really good~ from Korea. Thank you. I’ll make it too.
Bago nyo po ba nilagay yong garlic sa butter ni prinito nyo poba
how about if no oven, any suggestion?
When do you add the parsley’s
pwede ilagay yung mussel shell sa loob ng oven? is it safe sa electric oven?
Ilan degrees mo sya ibbake for 10-15mins?
Ugh absolutely amazing food 10/10
Lovely.
Putting cheese on mussel ruins it.
can i store baked mussels in the refrigerator?
You didn't show when did you put parsley, salt and pepper
Very good job
Nakalimutan mo ilagay yung Parsely at salt & pepper.
I like it
I love your all videos
You make my day great
