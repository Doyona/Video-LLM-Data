.... Even if you stand there stirring like crazy cranked me up seriously 😅😅 Thank you so much for all you do. I have been following your instructions from your web site before YouTube more than 10years ago after I tried frying stew for the first time as a year 1 student in the university (no more mummy's food) and burnt the hell out of the tomatoes then I found your website and since then cooking has turned my hobby. I always come around whenever I have to make new dishes especially soup.
Vegetable oils are not good for consumption. Canola, grapeseed, sunflower, peanut oil are not actually vegetable oil. It's false advertising. The BEST fruit oil to use for cooking is coconut, avocado, palm, and olive oil.
Why do u remove seeds
I just tried this today. This was my first time preparing a large amount of stew. I’m a first time mom and cooking for a toddler and husband all the time is not for the weak!!  I’m so happy I did this! My stew came out perfect with plenty for freezer and the meal I prepared tonight was too delicious! Imela o
❤👏👏💯✔✔
Why didn't you use bell peppers?
Are plum and Roma tomatoes the same?
Thank you so much. My internet aunty 💐💐
Flo thanks for your originality. Makes me remember mama's cooking. You can try ninja products for blenders.
Love this recipe!!!
Try blendtec blender. Even the cheapest one i got grinds moi moi beans smooth like engine back home.
Thank you flo, my mother died before I had the opportunity for her to teach me to cook, your channel helps me thanks a bunch!
Lovely recipe. I’ll surely give it a try.
I fry my tomato first instead of steaming. It takes my time a lot 🥺
One thing I love about Flo is her originality. I chose to watch this video from 5years ago because of a truth, no too much paparazzi for Tomato stew like some other you tubers try to do just for content sake. Nice one flo
Nice one 👍
You use only this type of pot,how health reason.
Nice video Flo but what's the reason you removed the seeds from the tomatoes? I'm just curious
I have being following your videos for a while now and I love your work. Keep it up ok as we keep learning from you. Jesus Is Lord.
Lovely 😙 👍
I love your method. You must be a science student
I ❤ This
Aunty Chinyere I love you so much your simplicity is something else
"Fly on low heat until the oil becomes translucent and also do not put onions first to avoid pot stickiness " point taken.  But I don't like the oil draining part and I will try avoid adding lots of it.  Thanks a bunch.
Reder 😅
What about Rapeseed oil.
Thank you so much for all that you do. Your consistency is so admirable. I remember about 6 years ago when I used to go to your blog to learn how to cook and surprise my people. You be Oga, well-done ma. Can I just add my fish and seasoning to it and use it to eat rice like that?
Although I don't hear Igbo, I love her humour blended with the Igbo intonation.
Vitamix is a blender that blends tomato seeds.
The video is so informative. This is the reason I love watching your videos, you take time to explain so many things clearly, always informative.
If u don't have fresh tomato
Can u cook stew with only tomato pastry?
My Vitamix liquified the tomato seeds.
Lovely
Mama Flo you are the best... I used this recipe to the very last letter and made the best stew and jollof rice I have ever attempted, after 6 months of getting wrong. You are awesome thank you for all your great tips and my best wishes to that lovely family of yours that always eats great Nigerian food
Vitamix will grind up anything. It even grinds lemon seeds and ginger root well.
Love your videos BC there is always sth new to learn,thanks dear
Is there a way to make tomato coconut stew ?
Hmmm Thanks For this version of cooking stew o. I used to fry the onions first before adding the tomato paste. No wonder it gets sticky. This is my new way of making stew. Thanks a zillion😘
Blender that can blend anything: Vitamix. If you leave it going long enough, it can even make a puree soup by heating it since the blades are so fast. We have a normal blender jar, and a flour grinder jar. You can clean it easily by putting water in the jar with a drop of dish soap, and it will clean itself by blending. We have had the same Vitamix 10 years with no issues! They have a 7 year warranty. I know this is an old video but I thought I would share
When I heard her accent I knew she would know hot to cook patty jellofu
This video helped me tremendously in fixing this stew. It reminded me of when my Nigerian friend would prepare it for Jollof rice. Now I can make my own. Thank you!
Hii flo. You are still the best ever since i have being following you!  I love your sense of humor especially the way you spoke. I love you.
Your recipes are always on point. Im going to make my stew like this abd give you feed back. I love your videos and watch you all the time.
I watched an interview of a female Ghanaian musician and they ask her if she can cook. Guess what? She said, she doesn't know how to cook. She said she will learn how to cook from YouTube. Imagine you marry such a person what will happen 🤔.
Nice one Chinyere, I tried it but my tomato still taste sour, I don't know if it's because of the type of tomatoes I used. Am based in the UK and their tomatoes is not too good. What more can I do to get rid of the sour taste pls?
I experienced that burning. I didn't understand how the stew got burnt but I was there the entire time! Now I know, it was ths onions! 😅️ I'll try again!
You're the best
Wow! See palm oil substitute right there! You’re a star!!! Thank you.
As usual, lovely video. The blender you need is the Vitamix. It blends literally anything, I mean a whole apple, seeds and all into a smooth paste. I will definitely try this.
Sis, blenders with power about 2000watt or more will do the job for you
You are just the best, thanks ma.
If I make half of your recipe, should I keep the same cooking times?
You speak beautiful english
I always love cooking with u ma
You don’t need salt in this stew? Or when you make it with beef or chicken you can add salt
Just want to say if you want to cut out the tomato paste for a more organic stew, using red bell peppers works well for coloring too.
Thank you for this video i love it so much. I am not Nigerian but my husband is and I've made this for him yesterday and he was too happy about it haha! I'll be watching more of your cooking video's, keep up the good work :)
I'm a black American and I absolutely love nigerian food. The only thing i dont like about it is the amount of oil Nigerians put in their soups. Oil is 120 calories a teaspoon. That's a lot of calories and the Nigerians pour huge amounts of oil that is infused throughout the soup. I have eaten egusi soup  (a very delicious soup) at many restaurants in Atlanta, GA and Houston, TX) and the soup was so oily. When it cools the oil can be seen pooling on the top. I'm always horrified to think I had just eaten all of that oil. American soups are far healthier (with the exception of soups with cheese. Etc.). We never load oil in our soups.
Vitamix blender pricy but worth it. Mine is 4yrs old and still ticking
Hi I do I store it can I freeze it? Thanks
Omg I haven’t seen this is years. Brought back so many memories of the grandmother. Oh how I miss her 😭😭😭😭 My ma used Palm oil though. Does it make a difference?
God bless u madam Flo...ur basic teaching is d bomb.
You taught me a lot I always wondered why my stew had a funny taste I used to just add and asd
The Vitamix will surely liquefy those tomato seeds.
Wow, never seen this oil cooking method before. Subscribed! This is going to be so useful, I'll try to make this at some point. Greetings from Sweden!
Really informative!
for a good blender try vitamix!
Is it ok to blend the onions with the tomatoes?
Her accent always gives me joy. I love you MA 😘
Stainless blender will do d job
I enjoy it ma more grace
👍
Very good recipe and time saving. Thank you. I love paprika in my jolly rice or stew, with this method, please when do you add paprika/bell pepper/sweet potted pepper ? Thank you
I would have loved you to write out the list of ingredients needed so I can take it to the store without watching the entire video
Thanks for your work auntie Flo I just tried this...I cook fish stew for my Igbo man today and it turn out well...much love from turkey
I just made my stew and it tastes so good! Thanks girl,You really saved my house ❤
Your English is good.
We have been using our 'KitchenAid' blender for about eight years. It blends beans into paste same with tomato seeds.
Your grammar usage is what keeps me watching. I love it.
Please what happened to the tin tomato?
Thanks big aunty I have learned a lot from you God bless  you and your hand work 🤗
Thanks very much ms. Flo I am going to try this receipe very helpful my sister love you & stay bless.💕🙏🌷🍴🐟
That's amazing , can I use the tomato without removing the seeds?
Can't I use  a very small pinned strainer?
I didn’t know she was the one behind allnigerianrecepies website i always use that site! So this is your YouTube eh ok thank God now I can see instead of just reading!!! I have subscribed to you. God bless you.
I suggest VitaMix powerful blender
Your voice is what I love listening to...👍
Engineer ;)
I'm Filipino and my husband is Nigerian and I've used this recipe for a few years now, this still makes the husband happy  😊 Thank you!
This commentary is giving me life 😄😄
You can't even call yourself a Nigerian if you or your mom don't do this 4:42 😂😂😂🇳🇬
Who else is watching this in 2018? Well, I tried adding oil to the already cooked tomatoes while adding onions but my heart is doing me "kpim kpim" because I'm not used to it😂  I fried my onions in a separate pot and poured it into the main pot. I'm yet to experience bottom pot burning
Can I add red palm oil  instead of veg oil?
do the seeds have to be removed?
Nice to know, would it be better to brown the oniens befor, to add taste? Please lok at my new chanal abut a life wit a lot of paine, thanks
The magic bullet blender grinds the seeds
I love how u poured all that oil out and it’s cute when u said the oil will obey the law of physics
Igbo woman I really enjoyed ur video thanks
This is lovely. Thanks a lot for the good job. I have learnt something new. Hailing from Italy.
Hello my dear.  I use the Ninja blender.  I make tomato stew from time to time and it totally blends all tomato seeds beautifully.  It has a very powerful motor, and i throw the habenero in there as well.  No more dishing seeds for you!!!!!
Hello I'm a little confused, just trying to get it right if I take it out if the freezer, it thaw out boil the meat and then I heard you said add the tomato stew??
Did you take the tomatoes with the plum tomatoes
Nne thank you for this recipe. I cracked up when you said "stand there, stiring like crazy", bc that's me :) LOL. Now, I have learn a new way, thank you!
See no one ever told you that you should remove the seeds out of tomatoes and peppers. This might explain everything
What is the name of the oil please
Lovely
Did any one notice she didn't add salt and co
Hi Flo, Why do you have to remove the tomato seeds? I m sorry I didn’t get that.
you are good cook, any day.
Sister Flo try Panasonic blender it is amazing in grinding tomatoes and beans for moimoi very smooth
Loved how easy you made it. Thanks.
Please buy blendtec for all you blending  you will  save your self time.
HI Flo I'm here from Obodo Oyibo! Lovely recipe you're such a talented cook! Can't wait to try out your recipe. Much love to you!
😍😍😍👍👍👍👍
well done my sister ,yes in this video you asked about blender, yes I will recommend vitamix blender though it very expensive but it is worth every penny and it took me a very long to decided to get it or not that is due to I have tried so many blender from Ninja blender, kitchen aid but they don't do the job for me especially when it comes to making moimoi my blender will start smelling like burnt rubber, finally decided to buy vitamix it been 5yrs plus and I never have any problem with it.what I did was I bought the refurbish one direct from vitamix and it works just fine,please if want to the refurbish one don't buy on eBay or any other websites buy direct form vitamix plus they will give you 2 years warranty which makes it better in case something happens to the blender,This blender will liquify your tomatoes like water. I love my vitamix .
Good job dear but instead of pouring water to blend the tomatoes and later waste your time, electricity or gas waiting for the water to dry up; you might as well chop your tomatoes on time into a seiv to collect and use the water from the tomatoes because they contain nutrients and antioxidants the body needs from those tomatoes or better still don't fill your blender at once. Chop and blend very small amount about 3 or 4 depending on size, then the juice it makes will be able to blend more without pouring water. But Good job. Well done.
I love this vid 😃
Thank you for sharing, am certainly  going to start using this method for making my Nigerian stew.  New subcriber!
Too bad english
Don't waste the seeds, put little honey, u will enjoy the juice.
Your stew method has hands down been the one to give me a perfect out come every time!😙💚
chaii this girl oh. GOD WILL BLESS U SIS. the amount of tomato burnt in my lifetime is not quantifiable. Thanks for the tip. saw it been done in my childhood, but didn't know the rationale behind it, so i just lost it as i grew.
If the tomatoes seeds are left will it spoil the stew.
The Nutribullet is inexpensive and works wonders. It blend anything down to its finest consistency.
Hi Flo!! How do you store the tomato stew? Do I have to freeze it or can I store it in mason jars in the fridge?
I love her voice. 🙂
Maam you voice is heaven sent,, what about the pepper. When do you add it
Please how many mins did you boil it for before adding the paste ? Great Advice
Mhhh, yummy, the recipe is wounderful. Only I cooking without oil, because Dr. Esselstyn say when you take oil out of the plant, is bad for the deposit in the vene. And later 50 or 60 years old you geht a stroke heart attack. I take vegetable stock and I taste yummy. Thanks for the wounderful recipe.
I love your video.  You totally got me when you brought in the law of physics. You’re my kind of woman !!
The Ninja one glass does a beautiful job on fresh tomatoes. Though I found a handy shortcut is heavy puree made from plum tomatoes.
Why remove the seed from the tomatoes??
Try the kitchen Aid blender. They are super even for beans
Do you add red pepper with the tomatoe puree?
You can try the ninja blender are the optimum blender!!!
When I was small, we used to take them to the local blending shop with the big locomotive blenders, but they blended everything well. Even the beans for moi-moi.  So nostalgic now.
yummy
What the hell i miss amala with egusi and beaf stew. I miss you abeokuta
lol, i love your accent
Can you please tell us what kind of pot u use or a link of where a person can buy a similar pot u use?
Try not to reuse the oil for frying too many times as that can be bad for health because it leads to more free radicals in the oil (which may be carcinogenic and also have other bad health effects).
seriously this is the best tip ever plz continue the great job
kenwood blender the one that is not a plastic Base glass container
vitamix
Can I just add red food colouring instead of using tomato paste?
Can I use canned plum tomatoes? Thanks in advance
Im in the process of making this for my husband and the instructions were very easy to follow from the video that is on your website. I used my NutriBlender to get the tomatoes to the consistency that you did.
Good job dear, have you tried the Ninja blender? Works well for me.
So you are basically tricking the pot @5:57 👍🏾
why remove the tomatoes seed?
use Master chef blender, it blends smoothly 😋
Pls ma what is the difference between groundnut oil and d vegetable/sunflower one. Is it ok to use groundnut oil like we would in Naija?
how do I get rid of the soar teast
i love her sense of humor ....and her knowledge of the law of physics....and my best line from her is.......she has been through soo many blenders through out her life
nice one but no pepper
Love this great voice over and very informative video
woooooooow loving nd thanks for uploading
Thanks
Nutribullet blender  grinds tomato and pepper seeds into a very smooth paste.
Can you use plumTin tomatoes or chopped Tin tomatoes.
Do you add oil to the tomato puree?
I have a Blendtec blender (they are pricey, and a main competitor of the vitamix brand), and they can absolutely destroy tomato seeds. If you do a youtube search for "Will it Blend" it's an entire series where they blend different things with that powerful blender. They come with an 8 year warranty, too! You can also buy refurbished ones if you're looking for a less expensive version.
The recipe looks delicious. How many ounces are the cans of tomato paste?
I like your method better. When my Nigerian  husband made this he always smoked up the house terribly! Whenever he made this- I would come home and race for the windows or balcony because he would blend the scotch peppers and onions WITH the tomatoes and THEN pour it into *smoking hot* palm oil! I knew there had to be a better way of making this. Thank you so much!
Thanks so much......today I will make my husband happy😉
The  kitchen aid diamond blender or the kitchen aid proline blender those are the best
WE TANK GOD !!!!!
My Nigerian dad makes the stew and it's awesome. I now live in Louisiana and the small town that I live in does not have pounded yam. Any suggestions on what I can use or how I can get some please?
invest in a vitamix, they are the best pricy but worth it
i still wonder why after frying, my stew still taste a bit bitter
I love it. the pot thinks you are cooking it 😂😂😂
I love ur cooking keep it up u have tot me alot👍🏻
Thanks for everything! My father is Nigerian and I love keeping our culture alive! My family enjoys these meals
what is tha purpose of removing the tomatoe seeds?
I just made stew using your recipe and it was BEYOND delicious that I'm convinced someone else made it. I'm one of those weirdos who can't stand the sight of cooked onions so I used my stick blender. This stew was just too good.  Thank you!!!
I love this woman's humor
my kitchen aid blender doesn't fail. bn using it over 3 yrs now
Wow, so nice. Very understandable. New dimensions to frying it. God bless ya
Unwa  wheeeen diiiiid yooou? Coook?
thx love it🖒
It's 4 o'clock in the morning and I just tried this!👌🏽
This looks very very good and I just subscribed!! Thank you!! Mike New York
Clean kitchen and very well presented method of preparation.  Your instructions are clear and well enunciated, sister. Mail me some bitter leaves, please. I've looked everywhere to no avail.
Wow... Thanks a lot... I now have another method of frying tomato
nutribullet rx will grind  tomato  seeds
Thank You Thank You Thank You 😆😆
Thankyou ma'am :)
A ninja blend is no competition to a vitamix sorry it want last
The best on the market hands down is the vitamix I bought one in 2010 used from eBay for $270 i luv this blender, it can crush any thing.
Can you put the oil on top of the tomato paste instead?
a ninja blender the blades are strong and I had mines for 2 years and still works like I just have it
God bless you. Thank you.
I use a Nutribullet to grind the tomatoes
how much soup does this recipe make? in milliliters please
OMG I LOVE TOMATO STEW I MADE MY OWN YESTERDAY THANKS TO YOU!!! :)
Thank you I'll be trying this this weekend!
my dear...this is my new favorite channel!💚
yum yum i love tomato stew, can't wait to try making it!
Yammy
love this recipe
thanks so much I love it video the way you explained every thing
Try vitamix, tomato seeds are no match for it. That's what I use and it's great. Even grinds, kale and strawberry seeds.
The easiest way I get rid off the seeds is, after blending the tomatoes, I pour all in a sieve and stir it until only the seeds remain in the sieve. The tomatoe then is very smooth. I love your videos, thanks!
by the way your voice😊 is soooooooooooo soothing... makes me miss my mom
for a good blender....  go online and get a juicing blender instead. the blades & motor are meant to pulverize fruit and vegetable flesh, skin and seeds into a smooth consistency for juice.   oh! you'll pay about 3-10 times😯 the cost of a regular blender... however it's an investment and we'll worth the cost.   I clean and store mine properly...  its been 9 years and it still runs like new.  a good system should run from $150 - $300... magic bullet is a good brand. amazon sells a lot of them; and if you're able to secure a lifetime warranty, purchase it to secure your investment.
Vitamix Blender for the win! That will blend anything!  Thanks for the great video.
love the fried technique!! I know all of your dishes are yummy!! and those tomatoes were beautiful😃😃
In England the fresh tomatoes are not always ripe. can you use tin plum tomatoes? if so how much would you use for this recipe. many thanks
Can I also use any other dried fish, cs here I find only the locale kind who has a really salty taste, insteat of stockfish is that the same ? Thank U.  I love your cooking video's and the recepies I tried to make are very tastefull one by one. May U  have a nice cooking day dear. Thank U for sharing all this tastefull recipies.
hi!i have a question please,i will like to know why u remove the tomatoes seeds?if not what can happen?,how will be the result?thanks a lot 😊
Vegetable oil is not really good for you even though its traditionally used. I use Ghee (clarified butter) and stew taste so delicious 😜. Just trying to be more health conscious. Palm oil and coconut are good oils, but not for frying tomatoes.
Vitamix!! 😊 I just made stew with it 2 days ago!
Thank You So Much! This is a great tutorial video. I am 20 years old and living on my own so I figured it is time I better learn how to cook real Nigerian meals. :)
My question is when do I add my seasonings and spices to the stew? Thanks
Yeeeeeiii... am soon getting maried to my nigerian sweethrt. Clearly. I will have no issues preparing his meals. Thanks to you @All Nigerian Recipes
Thank  you
Since you are a pro chef, I recommend Vitamix Professional Series 750. I use it and it the best creation since slice bread.
i will u to us this mixer grinder New comet is very good and strong u can us it to grind any ting Indian product
Wowwwww very great video n thans too for d tips . So so helpful. Great Job you are doing
Hi. Could you please confirm the quantity for tomato stew. 3.2 kg tomatoes and 400g tomato paste or 1.5 kg tomato and 600g paste
HiCould yo please tell me if I should use 3.2 kg tomatoes and 400g tomato paste as stated in the video or 1.5 kg tomato and 600g tomato paste as stated in the recipe book I have just purchased ? zunaidravat@hotmail.com
the "Bullet" girl!
Hello auntie I shall be making this for the first time soon. Wish me luck lol
God will bless Nigerian recipes  website
if the seeds aren't blended, would it be noticeable after frying? I don't understand the importance of the seeds not being blended.
thanks a lot mum.
i like your accent. :)
came out well and tasted nice but got burnt in the part where u pour in the vegetable oil in the dried tomato mix...
Exactly I hate tomatoe seed. l remove everything before cookin
God bless this website!!
Great video
Oster
I use red Palm oil
This is the best instruction for cooking tomato stew, I have seen! Perfectly explained.  Thank you so much!
Honestly, i enjoyed this method very much. Is it only tomato we use for jollof rice? what of tatashe?
very well explained, thumbs up
Hi Flo, why is it important to use fresh tomatoes? Surely I can use tinned plum tomatoes?
Wow love it must try
try a ninja.
this is really awesome, thank u so much for this demonstration, love it a lot.
Very creative...
Hi  have you tried a smoothie maker to grind your tomatoes.  You will have to only use it on tomatoes though, because if it is a plastic jug your smoothie will always taste of onions or pepper. It's not such a problem with a glass jars. I have a bullet express which really gets the job done. Hope this helps, your videos are awesome. Blessings, Stella
Hi there, you can also chop all ingredients into large chunks ie; tomatoes, onion, tatashe or red bell peppers and scotch bonnet peppers, roast at 400F for 45-60 minutes. Puree to a paste in a blender (no need to add water) instead of taking out the seeds and boiling the mixture to get a puree OR place the ingredients in a pot and add a cup of water, place on low-medium heat and boil for 10-15 minutes. pour into a strainer/seive to remove any excess water and blend without water. The result will be thick and will require no further boiling.Enjoy!!! thought i should share this with you, i hope you try and like it too. lol
WOW FLO, VERY DETAILED VID (AS USUAL). TKS!
Really enjoyed ur recipe in tomatoes stew
Thank you so much for this video!  I will try out this method next time I make stew to avoid burning it :)  I really enjoy watching your videos.  You have a very relaxing voice and a bubbly personality! Thanks again!
Try kitchen aid heavy duty blender.
Thank You and I love you because I made some good stew. FROM CAMEROON
how long does it take for the stew to fry completely?
Lovely video and the stew comes out so delicious! Thank you for all your excellent videos, I learnt a lot and my husband is happy about it too . Much love to you
helpful indeed
Thanks a lot. I'm Indian living in Lagos, but I like frequently having Nigerian food. About the Blender, I use a Panasonic make Mixer Grinder with a 600 W motor. It can grind any seeds, no worries...
Thank you so much for your videos, really helped me. Please how do I get rid of the sour taste in stew? I fry and fry but still sour?
Vegetable oils are toxic when heated.  Stop using canola oil/vegetable oils and sunflower oil.  The best oils for cooking is palm and coconut. They have many health benefits. Olive oil is good for sauteeing and salad dressing not cooking at high temperatures. Vegetable oils cause dementia and heart problems. Coconut oil cures dementia and coronary problems.
hi..pls whats the essence of removing the seeds.puree substance from the inside;;is it to reduce excess water from the tomatoe..pls explain..
Very helpful... Thanks
Have you tried a Vita Mix blender?  It grinds almost anything, I believe it works well on tomato seeds as well.  It costs a lot compared to other blenders, but will last a lifetime.  I have had mine since 1993, and it is still going strong.  It is available in America, but not sure about the rest of the world.  There is another company similar called Blend Tech that is almost as good.  Good luck.  Love your videos.  Nancy Palik
Thank you ma for your wonderful techniques and recipes. I follow them with keen interest. In fact I am considering having a screen with internet connection in my kitchen just for your recipes :D. I especially love this one. Good way to store tomatoes for when it is out of season.
You havent lived until you've had this mixed with basic spinach and okra soup. I know the combination was really a "poor man's" combination that was done only in the worst of times, but it's amazing!
Wonderful video and money saving tips. I never thought of saving the oil or cooking without the pepper. You were very correct when you said adding the pepper in the blender first makes the house to peppery smelling. I like your ideas much better. Thank you so much for taking the time to share this with us.
Buy a Vitamix it works really well for anything. Thanks what we use in culinary school to make purees.
Did you try food-processor for blending?, Magimix or cusinart are very good.
I don't know who would have a bad thing to say about your stew but honey this stew is beautiful and "popping".  Thank you for sharing and keeping it real.  As for your blender--Vitamix!!!  It's expensive but WELL worth it.  I would't even cook this if I had to de-seed tomatoes.  With Vitamix you can wash your tomatoes and throw  6 or 7 of them in the mixer and it will blend them to a pulp. You even have to be careful you don't blend it until it foams with this blender.  As for those of you who turn your noses up at the amount of oil used--it "is" necessary to use all this oil (unfortunately).  I've tried it "the healthy way" with the olive or healthy omega oil and it just doesn't taste right.  I always wondered--how can I get that banging/tasty (greasy as hell) soup base that I eat at the Nigerian parties (usually cooked by older women)--well, here you go!!! Thank you Auntie!
Any NINJA food processor, from the lowest priced model to the highest,. will blend seeds, I have made flour using chickpeas in a NINJA..  You won't need additional liquid to process the tomatoes.  Be careful because this processor is so fast it will turn the tomatoes into such a fine liquid, a baby could drink it from the bottle, through the fine hole in the bottle nipple.
Blendtec blender is expensive but fantastic and super fast , it blends the seeds nicely
Thanks so much Flo, I never knew I could freeze the OIL and I looooove the idea of freezing the prepared stew but will it taste the same after defrosting? Like will it still have a fresh taste and wont that oil have a bit of water content after defrosting?  Also, I FINALLY told my husband how I learned to make his favorite dishes (I had to, he thought I was cheating on him because he knows when we in Nigeria I dnt have stomach for meat prepararions so no one was showing me there and he said that the food was too good for me not to learn from another Nigerian, hahaha) I showed him the site and he was amazed at how long I never told him and kept him guessing,all he could do was laugh at himself and say WOOOW.  Thanks again Flo, we love you mama :-) I think Im gonna do this today and make your beef stew, yummyyyyyy!!!
Vitamix will liquefy anything, even tomato seeds in seconds.
Hi! How long does a frying part usually take?
I LIVE for your channel!!
Vitamix or nutribullet are great blenders. Thank you for the video!
Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!! I made it today (less than 3L) and it came out great. Now I'm off to try your Jollof rice recipe!
Lol...You are actually frying it, but the pot thinks you are cooking it. hahaha
Vitamix Blender
Love Love Love! Thank you for staying traditional!! I don't like these new and improved Nigerian recipes.  I like the traditional straight from home taste!  I've watch multiple videos already!  Cant wait to try some! Subscribed!
Okra stew with fried fish
Congratulations!! I'm an italian chef and we do cook tomatoes in lots of our dishes, in different ways. But I had opportunity to taste the jollof rice from a friend and I've loved it. Now I can do my Jollof rice :D Thank you :) I can send you the proper Lasagna recipe, an procedures to how to cook, as good as my grandmother used to cook for me :)
have you ever tried using canned whole peeled tomatoes because here in the Philippines the tomato that we have are very watery id love to try some recipes especially the jollof rice but i am not sure if it would taste the same if i use our local tomatoes.
Thx so much for all your vedio,  I heard you ask for a blender that can grind seeds.  I have a vitamix blender and since investing in it I have never had to worry what I blend in it.  I juice a lot and it pulverize everything even ginger.  It is very expensive but worth the purchase and the warranty on it is great. Tomatoes  will be child's play for it.  They also have refurbished once for a little less.  If you purchase and you're not happy with it you can also send back no questions asked. Let me know if you ever get to try it.  Love cilla
why do you remove the seeds from the tomato?
Try Blendtec or Vitamix blender, cost about $500 but they last forever
Thanks for sharing. I live in the UK as well. Where do you get your Canary tomatoes from please? Thanks
I'm such a huge fan.   I love your videos.
Thank you for this nice video! :-) My BIANCO puro blends tomato seeds very fine, you can't see and taste them anymore.
I've had a VitaMix since the early '90's.  20+yrs & still works like a charm ~Oga Emma
Omg yes thank you so much.
... and I store the stew in small or medium jars without freezing, it stays good for months
super video! I use cleared butter for stew
Mnnnh thats nice , i like stew with pomo (cow skin) . thanx my sister .
Very nice. I was taught a different way to blend red onions, tomatoes and scotch bonnet peppers together. Heat up the oil till its hot then add the ingredients cook it for a while then add tomatoe puree and stock. Was I taught the wrong way? It tastes good still.  Jamaican and hubby is Nigeria.
I own a vitamix and it will blend pretty much anything. It makes seeds completely smooth. They cost about 500 us dollars though. Worth it if you use a blender a lot. Mine is still strong 8 years later. They last about 30 years
My stew always burns no matter how much oil I put...what should I do to prevent that?
Love your videos!!!
Wow! I'll do this because it's amazing to have while having my favorite dish, Jollof Rice!

I was also going to suggest a vitamix! !! This is the best blender ever and worth every penny. PLEASE come to Washington D.C. for a live class!!!!
I love all your videos, but is there no way someone can cook tomato stew without frying it? Frying of food is not healthy,it raises your cholesterol which is not good for the heart. Also continuous use of the oil isn't healthy too.
Eunice Bernard cut and clean the fish, put in another pot and pour a little water, add seasoning (stock cubes, onions, thyme etc) and steam till done. Some fish gets done in no time. You can also use grilled fish or fried fish. After pouring out the excess oil from the tomato stew, add pepper to it, salt and the water (stock) from boiling your fish. If you prepared a lot for storage, scoop the quantity you need into another pot before adding the seasoning etc. Stir very well then add the boiled/grilled/fried fish LAST and stir again. That way, the fish will not scatter in the stew. I did something similar with beef and chicken in the Nigerian Beef and Chicken Stew >> Nigerian Beef & Chicken Stew  Here's the video for the Fresh Fish Pepper Soup >> Nigerian Catfish Pepper Soup (Point & Kill)
This is very good. Am going to make tomato stew today after watching this video. Can you please show how to prepare fish stew as well as fresh fish pepper soup?  Every time I make the fish soup or stew , I always have to look for the fish in the soup as they end up in pieces in the pot. Thank you.
The ninja blender does it for me
Thanks Aunty Flo.. Found it really very helpful, storing away the excess oil!!! That's something am not forgetting in a hurry.. Thanks very much x
Your videos are quite helpful. I learned something new.
Thank you so much did not know I could do this and freeze it in portions..I'm going to make this so I can have it ready for Christmas for Oxtail stew....
I love ur videos soo much! Try BlendTec blender.
Check out some vids on the VITAMIX Blender. I got mine from QVC.com but Costco sell them as well.. It is so powerful you do not need to add water to the tomatoes like you did...You get what you pay for...
I have a Vitamix and it's very powerful and Costly but has a 5 year replace plan..
I love you!
None of your recipes have failed me yet, they always take me back home :-)
Another wonderful video! Love your technique and also your good tips! Thank you!
Thank you ma....the video is very helpful..
