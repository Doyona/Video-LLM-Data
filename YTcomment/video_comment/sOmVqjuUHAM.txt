Haven't watched this for years
Where can I find the original recipe?
0:50 this is exactly why I seriously dislike riye. She is pure arrogant
Again need help from coworkers the cooking
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Very nice 🎉 beautiful awesome
Rie is like my mom helping me with my homework if struggle too much 😭
Rie is an extraterrestrial scientist she is no ordinary human being.
Rie probably has back ache from that baby and carrying all of tasty 😭❤️
this is actually better content, seeing how people fail instead of you having to waste stuff and time is invaluable and you guys should make a lot of these.
There’s pans specifically for crepes. Makes it easier to flip them
😅😅🤔🤔
best 🍫🍫🍫🍫
6:50 min.: ........ AHHH, EVERYTHING WONG, CHINESE STYLE .. I LIKE :p
Technically Rie was the one who made the crepe
Even i can flip pancakes with my hands, its called fireproof hands, nikki DOENST have it
You see I told her that she needed to add more flour.
Just give up.
Girl you need to add some more flour that's why the damn crapes aren't rising.
AFTER MANY YEARS, I STILL LOVE RIE'S HAIR HERE
Crepes in poland are so popular! They're called "Naleśniki" (nah-lesh-nee-kee) and it's a common breakfast here.
Can we bring this series back please
It doesn’t seem like Rie likes niki
Watching American making pancakes annoys me so much I don’t understand how they make it so hard
"wheres the pea" "theres a *pea*ness"
niki is lesbian right?
After watching everything, coming back to this video is amazingly ;u;
Wait. NIKKI HAS A WIFE?
"i can call my wife" **likes the video**
10:31 😅
12:08 Wonder why is this censored :)
is Nikki lesbian?
I legit clapped for Niki for her amazing job so proud of her 👏🏼
How many of us have gone "i need rie" while cooking 😭
No one:   French People during this video: Why do they call it that 😬
10:06 that guy there be like heeyyyy
Eading😅😅👌🏾😋 Cute Niki😊
watching americans make crepes is so funny.. pro tip get yourself a crepe pan and DON'T FLIP IT WITH YOUR HANDS. if your pan is oiled enough you can just flip it by tossing it up and catching it
Crepe cakes is rather common in Sweden. But I don't like chocolate crepes. Or pain de chocolat. Or chocolate eclairs. (With chocolate dough, not chocolate covered white eclairs, those are yummy :-D) I think they are too bitter. Funnily, chocolate cake is my favorite :-D
Niki is married!!!!!!!!!! idk why am I so surprised😅
Niki is the perfect example of when you're actually VERY good at something but somehow always end up failing when you tries to show it to everyone
I did not know Nikki was 🏳️‍🌈 good for her tho 👍🏼
Rie is my fevourite from tasty, every time i watch Rie she makes me happy.
Auto Captions be like: ThE iNsEcTs ArE cOoKiNgggg
i just love how everyone calls out for rie when theyre in trouble
As an English person we usually make this kind of thickness pancakes but don't call them crepes (cr-e-ps not cr-ah-ps) we just call them pancakes
For those of you passed expire data boil the milke to know if it's bad it will curled
8:41 “cooking crepes 2 at a time.”
Well the first batter was good, the problem was Nikki didn’t cook it long enough. I have made crepes before and you have to wait until the enges look more dry
Niki has a wife?
4:16 hhhhhhhee
I just LOVE the synergy you guys have in these kinds of videos ! Please do more in the future, it's amazing !
niki acctually made the chocolate crepe cake better than the original tasty video bcuz hers had a thic layer of chocolate and nice and even not to liquidy it was like melted chocolate and in the tasty video they acctually use a waterry type ganache
Rie is the help button in every game but in tasty
The amount of times i've watched this video is just-
Niki: My best friends andrew. No its not its adam.  Andrew when he watches the video: I'm not crying,I am noooooooot crying
10:07 Adam sitting behind the counter next to Niki like a cat asking for attention or wondering what she's doing is adorable. 10:30 Andrew and Alix also behaving like cats checking in on their human is... yep, they're all cute cats.
6:43 is where ries recipe is
I feel like alexis, alex, rie , adam , niki and alvin are the best at tasty..
I love when she say don’t look at those look at this
Wanna save the world🌍 ……….rie……….can you come help😀
(5:54) Wait.... Niki is a lesbian?!! Ew.
12:03 they missed the high-five
okay what is going on on 12:09
That look Rie gives to Nikki like, "Surrrrree." 😂
they waste si much food every single episode
Niki: my best friend is Andrew- no it's not Oof.
Wh did they make a RAINBOW creap cake a year before doing a normal creap cake like what
I miss this shows lmao. I need Nicki's sense of humour 💀
It feels wrong without andrew XD
Am i the only one who smiled when niki called her wife and she said that when niki makes crepes, it tastes like the ones they had in Paris?  Idk it kinda just melted my heart a bit ☺️
Rie made me miss my mom more 😔
How can she called her wife as she is girl
Her wife
Idk dat niki is lesbian
Give Rie some credit for all the effort helping everyone in need
Adam is my favorite
this is basically tasty debunking its own recipes by testing them
Niki: “So, nazazoovahy own horn...” Uhhh...
The dark nerve reversely object because crocus explicitly miss amid a delightful rubber. wakeful, aloof tuna
Niki talking about what milk to use and she forgets what she was saying reminds me of myself when I talk and don’t know what I just said a few minutes ago. 😂😂
Betul tu saya sajalah yang comment Bahasa Melayu
Nikki is gay
Oh gosh every of this video has rie and it
Rie is so wholesome
She is a girl and she have a wife????
I dont like the way nikki talks,  she is just trying hard to be cute especially when she says what does ganache mean....
Is Nikki gay because she has a wife 😱😱😱😱😱
Andrew watching the first 5 minutes: :(
Nikki: “My best friend is Andrew....hahaha no it’s not it’s Adam” Adam: *bursts into laughter* Andrew: .....
"YOU where there?!" "I wAs ThErE!!!"
Riemer rkjmnr vfda Edd Ddd Do D D Did D  Rfdjukjl,more M Egon Mfd Fgnm NFS DF no  D Sfbn  Fun Fed DF no
The problem is that niki's batter is too thin
Wait, Niki is GAY????
niki gay✨✨✨
“My best friend is Andrew, no it’s not it’s Adam!”  *Ouch that must have hurt*
Why would you fry crepes without butter and in anything else than a cast iron pan? :/
Rie is just dying from laughing
0:54 😹😹😹
wait niki has a wife is she lesbian what???
My crepe cake: giant chocolate chips with frosting
Niki is a literal mood
oh how much i missed watching eating your feed and worth it 🥺
The reddy color shirt girl is boy or girl because she/he has a wife
Soufle cake would be easier, faster and lighter. Must try....
You can't spell friend without rie
Nikki's WIFE?
I think some of the people were drunk while making this video
lol wife
Is you gau
is Niki a Transgender
R
WHAT Niki's wife? ?? It has to be Niki's husband or ... are she g..?
It's hilarious that Rie, the culinary "expert" doesn't know what ganache is.
The coordinated textbook constitutively examine because use splenomegaly yell but a spotted pyjama. cruel, lethal barometer
Wow amazing
Wao first time seeing a lesbian
the little dance she did when she said “last one, last one” 😂😂
Crepes is basically the Kendall Jenner of the Cake Family
I always use a blender to make the crepe batter. Perfect every time.
I love her computer sticker ❤️😌✨🌈🏳️‍🌈
Rie is SAVAGE
Wait- niki is lesbian!?
Why’s talenti the only add in buzzfeed vods
Two *LEGENDS* OF TASTY a. *RIE* b. *ALVIN* ❤️❤️❤️
I still don’t quite understand why they credit their own visor?
I think you rest it to make sure everyone gets to know each other
12:57 There's what?! I genuinely don't know 😂
Wait, wife?
the floor made the crepe layers looks a bit thicc wich is great
This cake should be renamed   *ough* *ouuutch*cake*
😎
"Ive made crepes before, Rie"   <Rie silently nods her head>  When in doubt, call Rie :)
ga·nache /ɡəˈnaSH/ noun a whipped filling of chocolate and cream, used in desserts such as cakes and truffles.  I copy and pasted from google...
Us Russians are laughing so hard 🤣
I’ve rewatched this exactly 99982 times
compared to scotts pain when he made the 100 layer crepe cake
Rie is soo overworked
Homophobes rn:👁👄👁
12:57 Replay this and look at their individual reactions. Goodness. 😂
I’m gluten free so this is hard to watch 🤣🤣
"Cooking crepes.... Three at a time..."😂
I wonder who do the dishes ????
Eat your feed, kids!
I actually didnt know niki had a wife
I think niki forgot to use a non stick pan because she used a non stick when rie helped her and it works fine
if it doesnt impress Rie then there is no point continuing what your doing
Is ni
Rie: The ultimate mom of the group
Crepe cakes just don’t taste good. What makes crepes so delicious is that crepe are thin and fat crepe taste not good at all, like pancake batter and all compressed like that will make it soggy!  Single crepes are much more delicious. I made some mistaking in English but I’m sorry for that.
She is gay??
My favourite thing to do when im bored af!  1. Put on my Bluetooth earbuds  2. Play on my fav songs  3. Watch recipes on the tasty app!! ♥️♥️
0:56 when u are hurt but can't say😭
Just wanted a how to vid, not a comedy show. Goodbye
Yes Really everyone trying to impress RIE.
As a person who has never seen the butter having measurements on the package until this video, I can I indeed tell you that yes, it is a pain in the ass not to have any measurements on the packet.      Great video btw
I didn’t know niki was lgbtq+ trust me I support
2 years ago when I first watched this I found out about Lesbians and gays lol
1:05 saw someone doing a sound as I do with my hands for the first time
When she bought 2 more cook tops,  it reminded me so much of the game Cooking Fever. 😂  She's sweet by the way. 😆
Any problem can be solved in this kitchen if rie is thete
99% of the comments are about RIE!!🤣
Even if Andrew will not cook in any video but he is part of every video created by tasty because his voice is in the end of every video 🤣😂😂
Is. Ikki a girl
I was laying in bed just clicking on videos and sitting there listening to them and not even 5 seconds into this video and I just hear...     " This is *Eating you feet!* "      *ᵛⁱˢⁱᵇˡᵉ ᶜᵒⁿᶠᵘˢⁱᵒⁿ*        ᵈᵒⁿ'ᵗ ʷᵒʳʳʸ ⁱᵗ ʷᵃˢ ᵉᵃᵗⁱⁿᵍ ʸᵒᵘʳ ᶠᵉᵉᵈ•••
why is it blurred out at 12:09?
Rie is the mother of tasty she is everywhere
is niki man?
Nooo way, why would you use this instead of a very flat crêpes pan, therefore I must advice you that originally crêpes as we made them in Brittany (France) : we put the flour, sugar and cocoa powder if you need to, then mix the dry ingredients, in the middle of this you have to make a little well, then add the eggs and the melted butter, whip them a bit and add the milk while whipping and incorporating all the ingredient together. Let’s rest in the fridge for about 40 minutes. Then have a very flat crêpes pan or a Billig, let it become really hot and then add a little slice of salted butter , buttering all the pan, then add a bit of the liquid mixture and roll it all over the pan to make a large circle ,let appear the bubble , this means you can switch of side . Here are how Breton crêpes as to be done .
Niki:Rie Chocolate Crepes! Rie:Make it Fancy!👋😄
What the ur wife 😯
pov: your binging eating your feed during quarantine
Kelsie is lesbian!?
Its the cringy song that hits me 😂
Is niki gay
This is how many people were wondering how she broke her pinky 👇
Rie is like the google of tasty
🌸💕Rie is the best🌸💕
Is Niki a boy or a gay
ganache means mistake in french i think? Ganache was made by accident, somebody was melting chocolate in a pan and accidentally spilt milk into the pan, and it ended up tasting very good 😂
Rie and Niki are so wholesome
Motherfudger ok I will use this when everyone will point their fingers on me and call me an Imposter
I never knew she was lesbain at least you have met the person you love
Is niki a gayyyyy
Rie being proud mom
Nikkis a lesbian ?
When Niki said call my wife I was like WHAT???
I DIDNT KNOW NIKI HAD A WIFE AND FINDING THAT OUT MADE ME HAPPY
I love rie and alix
i realised some thing  noone likes the chineese
Is niki lesbian
i need someone like rie. definitely. like a saviour, comes when i really need help, and when she comes i can calm and know everything is gonna be fine
Rie: I am inevitable
I tried chocolate crepe cakes it was delicious the only thing is the texture is weird so if your not a texture person I don’t know I almost threw up but it was so tasty 😋
Honestly it wudnt hurt to give some coffee in the cream to enhance the chocolate flavour and the whole thing covered in the chocolate ganache served with a drizzle of caramel sauce
The crepe  mix was to liquisish
Just RIE
Remember Nikki from the 36 questions for man that was extremely sexist😁
Wait-Nikki has a wife?!i-wai-         I thought she was single 🗿
Why is it censored at 12:08
How can I join tasty
I noticed no one said it taste good. Welp that's the answer. "Soft" isn't a compliment.
Hey did anyone noticed nikki called her wife ??? Huh I don't get it ??? How can she call her wife maybe 🤨🤔🤔🤔😑😑😑🤨🤨🤨🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ still thinking
Today on Tasty: Tasty tries to make a cake from Tasty
when niki asked "rie what if this doesn't work?" and rie just smiled like telling niki "it's my recipe and i'm thedessertsnob" 😂
Don't take the complete credit... appreciating rie for helping her..in my opinion she should get the credit😌😌😌😌
@5:52 rie looks so much younger than her actual age
You meant mom not friend 😹
When i made the tasty recipe, i needed to cut the butter down by two tbls.
If you impress Rie you know you goood
What fixes everythig? Rie.

The 1st part of the video kills me😅😁
I love everyone at buzzfeed. These videos are so cool. Even though I bake all the time idk if I could do this but it would be very cool. Also... where do I meet Rie!!
Rie is so sweet & gorgeous. Her accent is super cute too. I love her! I watched this for the crepes, but the fact the she appeared randomly here made me smile. ☺️💖
i unsubscribed because of this gay girl
Im making for my sister birthday (ps. I dont have a oven and pray me good luck)😅
I got at shock when she said my wife like lol

Nikki:what if it doesn't works? Rie: *fake smiles* Am I a joke to you  You ungreatfull women I've always helped and whenever I told u something did it went wrong  You Baka!
Oh, look it’s my friends. Hi friends

Niki I live in India and here we don't have table spoon marking on the stick of butter wrapping.
i know niki is a lesbian but i know there are many men had a crush on her
I love niki
Adam may be Niki's Best Friend but Rie is Niki's Best fRIEnd
Nikki: What does gAnAcHe mean? Rie: *makes the cutest dunno face EVER*
Niki: It's too wet on the outside. (Worried Face)  Adam: *_Flashback to how you were talking about making crepes a bunch of times before._*   Flashback: _I'm pretty good at making Crepes._   After failing to flip many times: *I no longer feel great about this.*
Rie’s facial expression when niki said shes good at making crepes is just priceless.😂😂🤣
Wait, so in the States, skimmed milk has a blue top?   *British confusion intensifies*
One Random Person Who Like This Will BecomeA Billionire One Day
Ganache means imbecile. Learned that in an anime😂😂

Why is everyone making such a big fuss about her being lesbian?!?! Its no big deal to me. It really doesn't matter.☺😑
I love how Rie is the savior hahahha
𝚎 𝚊 𝚝 𝚏 𝚎 𝚎 𝚝
12:58 rie's cry laugh

That was a good high five.✋✋
Me: wishing I lived in America with the tablespoons on the side of the butter  Also me: sticking the spoon in to the Half cup of butter “yeah that’s about a tablespoon”
When it’s their own video and she doesn’t know how to do it 😂 I love this channel
What does ganache means ? Huuum ganache ? There is no secret meaning ^^
The comments are Karens and people over 30
Everyone is so surprised right now that she has a wife?! Did no one see her whole series with Buzzfeed about getting prepped for her wedding?
Rie is definitely Niki's work mom. The way she scolds her lol
Nikki is a lesbian? THAT SO COOL
...
So Niki is a lesbian ?
Damn, I wish I could be well rested after only 1 1/2 hours.
The real question is how did she get the cake from the cutting board onto the plate
Aku anak kecil bisa bikin itu
WIFE? WOAH I DIDNT KNOW!!! THIS IS SO AWESOME I LOVE TO SUPPORT LGBTQ+! okay okay crepe time hahaha
Someone get niki her own crepe restaurant
ouchie mamaaaa 😂😂😂
WHEN YOU TRY AND YOU DON'T SUCCEED *a quote I will say 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Andrew just wake up from his nap
Nikie has a wife😂😂😂😂I didn't understand

I love it when they make beautiful mistakes and then call Rie for a solution ✨🥺
Rie’s Recipe  6 Tbsp Melted Butter 1 3/4 Cups Flour 1/4 Cup Cocoa Powder 7 Tbsp Sugar 3 Cups Milk 6 Eggs
Ummmmm..... did you guys notice she said "I can call my WIFE" at the minute 5:54. im like......whatttttttttttt ??????????
Niki has a wife? I never knew that but no judging tho
Normal couples: I want to ask you a question but you have to be honest with me... have you cheated on me? Niki: I want to ask you a question but yo have to be honest with me.. am I good at making crepes
Where i live we don’t have tablespoons on our butter
Why are you doing such a big deal about crepe literally child can do it
Can they make any vid with out rie’s help
Nicky I think I know why you were failing at making crepes your batter was to wet you need more dry ingredients
"Rieeee"
How much chocolate is needed?
Is Nikki gay or transgender, don’t want to be offensive, just wanna ask and does she actually have a wife
Let’s see Rosanna Pansino make that
Is Niki gay
Rie is real life waifu
Basically rie recipe is superior that viral videos recipe.
I know how you feel in the flip department. I've never been able to flip something in a pan :/  After watching a bunch of these videos I thought I could do it--- still no :/
when you get over confident then fail...
bruh why is everyone from tasty way older* than they look. lemme age like tasty producers ok
Is she gay ...bc she is a girl how can she have a w***
Broken Pinkie. This is either before or after the Home Buddies mansion episode with Garrett.
At when 1;29 niki said who invented putting tablespoons on the butter wrapper I was like I wish that same kind of butter wrapping thingy came in India too as it is really difficult to measure butter using measuring cups and spoons
Niki has a wife !!!
Wait I never knew Nikki had a wife
Rie what if this doesn't work?  Rie: smiles* assuringly
Niki has a wife?
Instead of whipping cream I used melted marshmallows
That cut at 5:40 😔😔😔
I messed up my food today and I shouted rie sadly she didnt magically appear
“iVe MaDe A cRePe BeFoRe!!”  “ *do you have a picture* ”
Feel kinda bad for Andrew tho
Hi Niki.❤️💋Ur fun n exciting to watch 😙🤩 "eading" 😅 0:10 - 0:12 my favorite part, its cute😂😂😍☺️
"This will be so chocolatey."    proceeds to add more chocolate gnash
7:59 it looks like a p***
Who thought she said "Eating your feet" at first 🤣🤣🤣
At 1:52 1 day past, laughs in 2 months past
Bro niki is gay??
I learned that the indent in the milk jugs are there for a reason, the reason is to tell if the milks bad because if it is it will pop out.
god that was frustrating to watch
When people in tasty need help:Rie!!???
How did you break your pinky Niki ???!
I feel bad for the person who has to wash all the dishes
its pronounced crep not crape
Am I the only one who buys butter without the tablespoon measurement thingy
When I make crepes I use an electric griddle
Niki: “Cooking Crapes 2 at a time”     Me: she should be an ⒶⓇⓉⒾⓈⓉ       Lmao
bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop- wait Nikki has a wife?!
Where I come from (Serbia), we call crapes pancakes, and I find that the easiest way to flip them is just with the pan, making a fast circle motion down away from me and back, thus tossing the crape in the air and flipping it. A easy "hack" for flipping crepes is using a glass pot lid. Cover the pan with the lid, turn it upside down, and then just slide the crape back into the pan. Oh and I try to avoid using induction cooktops for crapes, gas burners are a better fit for me when doing this.
Why do you use the different languages for them its called pancakes
Them sharing that slice is how the Corona virus got started😂😂😂jkjk
This looks very delicious and chocolatey.
Wait is that niki real wife? Is niki a boy or gurll???? Or is it just a joke?? Wth its too confusing:[
Rie is tasty's Jesus 😂
She has a wife
What is she gay
she has to be on nailed it like literly
Yah ! Good luck with eating ur feet 😂😉
Cheff levels... Level 1. niki Level 2. Andrew Level 3. Rie
I made it for my brothers bday
thank you adam for zooming in on the crepe
that is so much batter though. also coconut milk whipped cream wld be so good
Niki: what does ganache mean? Rie: 🤷‍♀️
Wow this used to be my favorite YouTube show but then Niki left Buzzfeed and then I found BA. Lol oops haha sksksksk  Also, is that the same Adam from VAT19? Just curious hehe
😯😯😯😯😯😯
Niki is lesbian qqq😯
Rie reminds me of the woman chef from ratatouille
0:53 Niki has the world's greatest "I couldn't be more offended" face
Niki is lesbian!!????
NIKKI IS A BOYY???!!
On the first batter it was to thick and looked like english pancake batter
6:00
wait nikis lesbian?
At 10:07 did anyone notice that Adam was kneeling behind the counter to get a front shot of the cake...when I noticed I thought it was damn cute😍😍
Niki: Spends hours upon hours slaving over a complex crepe cake.                                                       Rie: makes crepe cake in less than an hour with chocolate and vanilla pudding as the main ingredient
How come tie was so quite in this video
The result A crepe cake A burn finger
Who’s watching this during a global pandemic?
I think that pan isn't good for crapes, and it's better to use silicone spatula to turn them around.
N: Have you cut yourself cutting chocolate before?  R: *shakes head no*  N: *dubious but impressed* 😒oh
I used to think that crepe cake was pronounced (creepy cake) 😆
Oh she is a lesbien
7:10 to 8:10 they were beefin 🤣🤣
It probably would take someone all day if they were actually good at it
Ok to make this clear Niki seems to be lesbian (not saying that's bad because she has a wife) it doesn't matter her sexuallity it matters about your personality
if you go to 10:06 you will see adam eating, crouching with his head beside the bowl
Look how they joke dont you do that thats cringe for peoples nowadays
Niki: See even rie is struggling there is a problem with the batter   Rie: Struggling  Me: You have only made the batter so it is still your fault
Rie must be protected at all cost
I made this.. Very satisfying if you enjoy doing fiddly recipes.. Which I do.. Looks beautiful when sliced .. How does it taste? Flavor fine..But For me.. Just my opinion.. I didn't like the texture.. Unlike when warm the moment crepes get cold and then have a moist filling on they have a slightly leathery texture.. Which I personally didnt like.. Loved making it though..
first off how did you break your pinky ???? also that looks good !
Is that the recipe of Rie at making the Chocolate pudding fancy?    No?  Okay.
12:57 I’m killin’ myself laughin!
Rie is generally so calming for me. When she comes on screen I just feel at home. She’ll be a great mum because she’s already so mumly.
Rie saves the day. Everytime
how is it pronounced? creps or crayps or crepes
Make a milo crepe cake  Hi from Singapore
i thought the beginning girl said *eating your feet*
everyone:milk me:MeLk
Is she a lesbian let me know in the comments  Thankyou
Can we use all purpose flour Pls tell
10:40
5:51
Hispanic moms be like wtf to that flipping 😂
isnt that video from tasty to why not just ask the person in the video and ask her how to do it
ga·nache /ɡəˈnaSH/ noun a whipped filling of chocolate and cream, used in desserts such as cakes and truffles.
I had to get a whole cast for my broken pinky so I can kinda relate 😂🥺
Her wife ??? Really ???😵😵
Rie actually made a very similar cake in make it fancy
Tasty out here "testing" their own recipes
The amount of the ingredients weren’t clear
Ganache - A whipped filling of chocolate and cream. Ta da !
To think Tasty could have gotten the proper cooking equipment for making crepes like they do in France, then maybe Niki would have an easier time making crepes and she wouldn't have burned herself.
That's actually the sell by date that's printed on the milk when the store has to sell all of it within the time frame from the dairy to when it gets to the store before it goes bad.
The inventor of the measurements on the butter wrapper are thanks to a Mr. Robert J. Wentzel submitted to the U.S. patent office back in August 13, 1958 and was published August 9, 1960. ( courtesy of Wikipedia )  Your welcome !
I need a Niki in my life she's so full of energy and humor
Wait is Niki gay?
The reason it wasn't cooking properly would be that the chocolate crepes are alot darker.
After you loosen the edges on side one use you fish spatula to flip the crepe. Thin enough to slide under crepe & also wide enough to be able to flip the whole crepe. After side two is done should just slide out of pan so you don't have to burn your fingers. If sticking at all use fish spatula again.
WIFE!Is she a lesbian?
Me and a friend tried making a crepe cake when I was staying at her house once. It smelled nice at first. Then it turned from scent to fume. Yeah we ended up having to go into the basement it was so sickening. But dammit was that cake good...
"My best friend is Andrew" "Wait no it's not it's Adam"....what was that? lmao    I love these videos but sometimes it's like you just got back from filming a "I tried this fat joint" video.
AHHHHHH SHES LESBIAN
When she asked "where you there?" 💀savage rie
didnt know she was lesbian
Rieeeee! List of your recipe please? I want to try it too 😍
I KNEW NIKI WASNT STRAIGHT
4:17 what kind of sound was that ?
Cumming cake🎂😜
Rie started dying when niki showed Andrew the tiny peen on her crepe cake.
Turn the pan around that helps for crepes
1:26 yo Rie said the same thing once at 'make it fancy'
Tasty using their own video to make a video
is niki gay "Let me call my wife and she'll tell you I'm good at making crepes."
Bruh the joy I felt when she said- Call my wife- !!!!! Yes?!!!
"CRAPES"
Niki, do you not know how to flip them by flipping with a pan?!??
U making it  95% of viewers is gluten free
Me now realizing Niki has a wife...
I made this before. It worked really well
cOoKiNg CrEpEs TwO aT a TiMe
Almost Everyone in the comments  Niki Rie Adam Andrew  Me: is there even a comment about Andrew's comment about the crepes reminding him of those matress and peas cause I think it's from a scene in one of a Barbie movies
Niki: “Rie what if this Doesn’t work?”  Rie: :D
Who else is really annoyed when she kept saying crapes instead of crepes
Did she really call it egg juice?
Rie is life there life coach/ savior
7:58 true masterpiece
She has a wife 😍 and Rie is a legend 😍 she can make anything 💯😨
4:16 best moment
"We're adding some  sugar to the cream for the gnash but not too much since there's sugar in the cream" -Nikki at 10:51
I like how it went from not being best friends with Andrew but then being best friends with andrew
We in The Netherlands have pannenkoeken
I faced exacly the same thing when i tried to make one!!! The batter was too thin / too soft and my batter just kept on tore apart when i lift it! Maybe i should give a try to this one!! Good job girl!
And there is the As/Is femenist

New thing because its new year   Who watching this in 2020!!!
Is Niki gay
like who loves niki
Rie is like the godmother of the people who work at Tasty
I watched a previous episode of tasting your feed and she was cutting bread accidentally at an angle and said something along the lines of "I'm gonna try to cut this more straight... even though there's nothing much straight about me..." and I'm sitting here like "hm. Is that a gay joke?" And lo and behold! She calls her wife :-) Gay Singaporeans for the win 🏳️‍🌈🇸🇬
how many times Niki said ow: 👇🏻
In response to her question, I heard somewhere that ganache came from a French head chef calling his sous chef or another chef an idiot (or ganache) because they made something wrong but it ended up being delicious and what we now know as ganache. No idea how accurate that is, though.
One thing I have learned from making crepes is that the first couple never work out the way you want them to and that's okay
I made a crape cake with my friend and it was just a normal  batter and in stead of cream we used fruits juice and then we  put blueberries on  top and it was SOOOO GOOOD plz try at home bc its good!
If your nose is stuffy, do 3-5 push ups
I didnt know niki had a wife, im happy for her 😁😁😁
I just knew Niki is a lesbian 😂😂
How does Nikki has a wife
Niki if you’re a girl than why do you have a wife?
OUCHIE MAMA😂❤
In my country they don't sell stick of butter they sell package of margarine, and it's hard to measure 😭😭
“Fasta” 11:12
Yaaakk....lesbian..explains why she is so abnormal
Im sorry, but her face looks like a jelly fish
rie kinda reminds me of the chef from ratatouille lol
Adam: Looks like you're bein' fancy.   Rie: Come again?
Her: “Crapes” Me: *shivers*
What happen to Niki's pinkies?
Wait..Niki is lesbi ??!!
Awww it’s mama Rie 🥺🥺❤️❤️
the homophobic comments under this video because niki is married to a woman...🤢🤢🤢 yall disgustang anyways 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Food porn
ceramic pan. little heat. frustration.
10:38 I googled it. It's "fool" in French😂😂😂
The edit in 11:17 was just..
The butter thing.    In England we still suffer from having to measure it
I had no idea she was fricking lesbian
Niki is the definition of the 2019 tv show trend.
I was pretty suprised that nicky is lesbian😨😨😨🤯🤯
5:09
Niki: Noo luumpss Edna: NO CAPES me:..........Yes Cakes
No one:  Niki: Adam is my best friend
Rice is so cute
12:56 *theres the peep!*  Rie, in her mind: CoUgH im sorry what?
Mixing in a blender works better.
so thankful I can fully go on vacation all because of this. Search in Google without spaces *Easy Laptop Life .c om*
ugh I miss Niki :(
ok! SUPRISINGLY, milk actually last SO long past it's date like it's CRAZY
Niki: *a lesbian* Also Niki: makes a crepe p****
Niki: I need to work on my flip Brits: *Sips tea*
I've watched it a hundred of times and its still satisfying. I'm so inspired by this that I'm gonna make one now 😊
Just imagen being Niki's wife and then getting asked "i want you to be very honest with me" and thinking that she'll ask if your not cheating or somethin like that and being asked "Am I GoOd At mAkInG CrEpeS!?"
It’s like the one Rie Did in make it fancy making chocolate pudding
I hate niki
Rie is like a mom. Every time she walks in everything’s finally okay
Rie's is everyone's mom
what i learned from eating your feed: you know something is wrong if Rie is also failing
Hmm it's like you shouldn't put your fingers so close on a hot pan
5:52 wait.... she's part of the LGBTQ2+ community! oh wow that's nice :)
Wait is niki gay?
I’m only going to sift things wile saying no lumps from now on.
Damnnn that look 5:50
12:54 OH MY FUCKING JESUS CHRIST SHE PUT IT ON
she made a crepe penis
That’s why I make my crepe batter in a blender. I haven’t tried making chocolate crepes yet though.
Andrew Niki Adam and Rei are my all time favorites
I didn’t knew she was a lesbian jajaja
"Ok so, here we are this is eating your feet" it sounds like she is saying eating your feet sometimes.
4:08 how I feel when I hit the bully to make a statement
"Egg Juice"  -Nikki, 2018
legit the 1st 8 min of the video was just making the batter
The batter is currently sitting. Just 25 minutes left. Let's see how it goes 😬🤞🏻
Apparently I got a Tasty ad during the video...
You can use a ladel for the crêpes, for the scooping
Yay! A wild Andrew appeared! Oh wait. Holy cow. That's an Annie. OMG I CAUGHT A MYTHICAL POKÉMON!
That high five 😂
Is he ambivert? No judgement intended
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Niki: I love fat  Also Niki: skinny af
ooh someone should try making a 3d cat latte
Yall f*cking need to stop being so butthurt about niki being bi/lesbian. It's her life, not yours. And if you don't like it just watch a different video instead of complaining about it here.
Mine had more cocoa powder. 😘
I think is rie is kind of doubting her
is everyone at buzz feed LGBT
05:51 Rie's cuuuute face 😁 😍😍❤👑
HIS FACE AT 13:06 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rie is like Mom. she fix everything 😂❤️
Niki is a girl And She has a wife?
I fell you girl they are so good
Can you substitute the whip cream?
I did not expect Niki to be les (or bi, I don’t want to assume) Congrats! Yes i know they made a video
Best part andrew peeking through the door 😂😂😂😂
And u even made a penis so that's worth it that's nice😏
(12:44-13:06) Egoraptor comes out of left field: "It's time to live out our story, of the princess and the pea-nis!" (Line from "Luigi's Ballad)
Ya have to use melted chocolate it will be alot easier even thouhjt it not natraul the taste difference is not all that
13:06 now you can rob a bank
it's soo cute how she eats with both hands like a squirrel
I'm nick and rie is my mom when she's cooking
I love tasty but the only person I don’t like is Andrew. Comment if you are the same
The tasty cooktop is trash
it's the tasty equipment that ruined her crepes
I love Rie's calmness and humbleness 🌸
Nikki looks straight
In the UK we don't really have any measurements on the side of butter it makes life very hard 😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♀️
I thought the Nikki calls her wife is some kind of joke edit, like for example : I am gonna leave it for 10 years. and then it says "10 years later"
Nobody:    Not even my friends:   No one in the freaking world:   Me: HIIII NIKI’S WIFE
Watching this while eating crepes lol
rie is like the most professional  cooker at tasty
10:50 nikkis face lmao
Well I think Niki could commit a crime now & get away with it 😂✋🔥
when she said “we’ll rested batter” she sounded like francine from american dad 💀
I thought she’s lactose intolerant
I think Rie made all the work nikki keep asking on rie's help 1:rie made the batter 2:rie showed how to mix the batter nicely 3:rie checked if nicki was properly frying the crapes 4:rie made the chocolate guash 5:rie showed nicki how to clean the edges of the crapes IN SHORT RIE MADE THE CRAPES❤😂
Too much drama...  More than focusing on making them better u Wer playing around thats y u Din get them right
Wish I can try it😭😫
My mom used to make crepe cakes for us and when she finished she was always really exhausted. Now i get why 😂
I don’t want to be offensive but are most tasty employees gay ?
The best part when rie coming shes so cute
Am I the only one who has never tasted a crepe cake
I love adam
Rie is a god!! ❤️❤️❤️
This is so much fun just watching, I’ll make one crepe cake today, wish me good luck!
My favourite person/character(s) thingofmajigi are you Rie and you Niki,I don't know why but maybe because you both are from Asia and I'm from Asia too,I'm from  Bangladesh,I love  Singapore and want there lots of times and I really want to go to Japan so I don't know,so ya you probably think I'm super weird but I I don't care if you think I'm weird so yeah that's me Zarah😅
I love Rie
Wait, is Niki lesbian?
Niki: Makes layers    Alvin: I am the god of all layer foods.
Sorry bad show and presentation!!! Was this the fooling around show or was it supposed to be a cooking presentation? Maybe it’s me and I found this presentation very annoying.
What are they censored on 12:08..?
Mom: honey, I'm gonna make some crepes. Me: yayyy when will they be ready? Mom: tOmOrOw
I’m here to see suffering
you are annoying
12:58 Rie starts dying
What is the name of the song playing in the beginning of the video?
🚗🚕🚌🚎🚜🏍🚚🚛🚜🛴😀😃😄😁😆😅😅😅😂🤣☺😇😇🙂🙃😉😌😍😘😗😙😙😚😋
I wonder who invented putting tablespoons on the stick of butter wrapping because  i bet you before that was a real pain in the ass... I hope you're rich
11:53 when they didn’t blur out the *thing*
Niki: "I wonder who invited putting the tablespoons on the stick of butter wrapping. Because I bet you before that it was a real pain in the ass."....Me, from Germany, literally asking myself all the time why american recipes are in cups and spoons. This makes it so terrible to cook american stuff somewhere else. Cause you just have 2 opportunities. One, get a cup and spoon set out of the Internet. Or two, just convert all the cups or spoons to gram, which basically takes forever. 😂 Why don't you just use gram?😂😂😂😂
Where were crepes made France  Where is France Europe How do they say it in Europe CREP That's how you say jt
1:05 who can do that with their hands ,me- yes
Why does this look better than the video
refreshing to see one white dude with three asian ladies i feel like i never see that online - gotta love an inclusive company
she’s so cute i love her mannerisms
Am i the o ly one who is annoyed on how they say crepes like i pronounce them like 'creps'
she forgot the powdered sugar😂😂
Okay but why am I so attracted to Rie in that denim jacket??? How is she radiating this much BDE??
Her: let me just call my WiFe me: 😳 I though this was a kid friendly channel. Her: f&$k me: 😶😶😶😶
Her wife?
I love this video ❤️📹
Do you say it crep or crape
12:09 why was that corner censored?
Niki: *emotionlessly tilt the pan  Batter: *forms a D  Niki: it looks like a p3nis! *wheeze *wheeze  I didn't mean to do it! *wheeze
12:57 Rie is literally dying
Everyone is like surprised that she's a lesbian while I am like surprised that she is married
am I the only one who noticed Adam pause at 10:07
Everybody is talking about the crepes but can we talk about that high five at the end😂
Is that Adam from Vat19???
Rie should get a raise!!
WHO CALLS IT EGG JUICE
are Niki and Rie both Bisexual?
Its rie not ria
Niki: I'm going to ruin this  Rie: *YEAH!!*
This is the best creation I’ve seen Nikki make 😍
It's not 'craype' it's cr -e- pe. Like c rep e
Me first time seeing niki in tasty  Calls her wife Me: WIFE???
Niki:"there's a p**is" Rie: immediately dies
0:37 istg that indent is bothering me so much-
Tasty crew whenever in crisis- "Where is Rie?"
I literally want that cake rn
It's a crepe not a fucking crape. Wtf America
Nikki is a girl , BUT she has a wife!  Me:*SHOUTS* WHATTTTT! ME : don’t have idea   I’m confused 🤷‍♀️
When you add a high five sound to a missed high five 12:05
Wife?????
Is niki transgender?
“I hope you’re rich” 🤣💯
You need butter
I pronounce it "crep" Not "crape"
She's lesbian dang
Y'all are immature af 😂
The key is don’t joke too much the crepes have some sprinkle of her saliva 🤨 watch bbrrttt
Is Nicki a guy or girl
https://youtu.be/a5hHg45nBRc
Her song tho
A crepe should br about 1 milimeter thick. If you don't agree. You're not making crepes that have a good bite and not making crepes that are traditional
*_"If you make this for lunch I will remember you."_* Lmao
I feel like Nikki’s crepe cake is better than the one on the video
Who takes a hot pan off the stove dumbass😂
She'd have a better time making crepes on a hotplate that wasn't terrible.  The number of reviews about the Tasty hotplate being an unevenly heating piece of trash is insane.  That's half of the struggle with a lot of these videos is them getting around how bad that thing they have to use is.
Give the recipe in the description
7:59 its so gross
why doesn nobody talk about adam’s mustach
Does anyone else keep coming back to this video?
5:09 *angriness dog sounds*
1:04 What if she was actually farting but made it seem like it was her hands.  Conspiracy theories with Shane Dawson
Niki who is ur wife
Is niki lesbian????
Can u pls not make the lovely person that Nikki is feeling bad for diving the world into two just for saying she has a wife? -.-  She loves a woman, big deal. She doesn’t need to be nor accused or defended, cause she’s just like everybody else.
This question has been bothering me for a while : who washes the dishes after anybody is done cooking?
when you are trying to not swear on camera "Mother fudger" "flip" "ouchy mama"
12:08 Why is the cake blurred on the side? Does the cave have a dick??  Edit: I just finished watching the video....yes it does...
She's so bubbly and cute uwu
Let me call my Wif..  Wife  Wait. whaaaat
you forfot the powdered sugar.. lMaO
How to solve every problem in Tasty ever: "...Rie?!!"
10:06 Adam making sure its edible.
"Let me call my wife and she'll tell you I'm good at making crepes." WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤮🤢😨
Niki has a Wife? I DIDNT KNOWZZZZ SOMEON PLZ TELL ME IF SHE DOES OR IF WIFE MEANZ BESTIEE
Niki is a lesbian
4:16 when she said “hhhhhhhh” I lost it 😂
Maybe the pan is not hot enough.
Is Niki gay???
Is she
“theres a pe(a)nis” HAHAH
12:57 LOOK AT RIE!!! SHE LOOKS ADORABLE!
Why is Rie depressed?
What Niki is lesbian🤯
Batter was to thin at first n the pouring technique Was wrong
It was probably because of the "Milk", as to why the first batter didn't work. 😂😂
4:17 tHAT SOUND
Egg juice  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 2:19
its crepe not crape. pronounce it correctly
Milk, flour eggs that’s all it takes xx
Kids are like crepes, the first ones never work out
Nicki has a wife im SHOOCK
Rie is awesome!!!! She must be the nicest person ever ! Kind of reminds me of a younger version of my grandma  :)
Rie is actually perfect;-;
Niki:” it’s such a thick layer of chocolate!” Won’t stop purring chocolate...
“Ahhh mother ffffffffhudger”🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who ever thinks of eating your feet instead of eating your feed
7:57 ejaculation lol
i put on shiny from moana when then they were pouring the glaze XDXDXD
She is gay ewww
8:19 her face though
The pronunciation is killing me
DIdn't know she loved woman, I have a new found respect for her. 6:00
she is gayyyy   well.....i dont care keep up the good work nikki
Rie: *walks into room* Legit everybody in the universe: scared noises
I’m Mexican and I’m cringing because of how she says “crepes”
I never knew Niki was Lesbian but... I SHIP IT
trust rie and her recipe
I like Rie the most
She’s lesbian that’s ok 👍
so bad she called her wife :LI
Egg juice 😂
Omg....niki is GAY
I am french and I find it far more difficult to make pancakes than crêpes. I've never ate crepes with cocoa flavoured batter. Maybe it is the reason for the failures ?
0:20 I heard I'am a big fan of creeps......
I broke my pinkie once ... I missed out on my only football finals and we lost. People blame me for it to this day
niki's lesbian?
"Eating with feet"i was like you nasty
0:38 IIIIIIII
you should buy a pan specifically to make crepes
Hey people, here’s a different type of crêpe from French-Canada that came here with the colonisation in the 1600s and 1700s  Combine all ingredients in order:  2 eggs 1 cup of flour 1 1/2 cups of milk (preferably from Canadian Dairy Farmers (without GMOs and humanly raised)) 1/4 cup of melted butter (once again, preferably from Canadian Dairy Farmers) 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon of salt  1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Cook 3mm thick of batter in a hot pan with a bit of melted butter and flip once  Enjoy with pure Canadian maple syrup!
Rie always have a smile on her face and itsss cuteee
nicky u pretty
I miss Niki
I tried this and got so many air bubbles
Is niki a lesbian?
Just you know there is such thing as crepe making tools that really help
You can cook crepe but you cant pronounce them lol
I want that laptop sticker
Ganache is the French world for "chocolate glaze" basically Ahah in case anyone was wondering !
1:04 the moment i stop watching tasty videos with this producer..
Rie is low-key looking the sexiest in the denim jacket. She made it fancy😂
"This is gonna take a long time, I thought the hard part is over.."  *me on an exam*
8:08 Okay, *TEST WAN*
Adam is like the most silent cameraman I had influenced
I wonder who will wash all dishes My mom
Ewww nikis lesbian
Big fan of creeps🤣😂
See 10:48 Nikki's face
People try to bake/cook then they fail they call in rie that’s like me when I use to play fortnite and called in a friend to Carry me lol
10:07 a wild Adam has appeared. *Alternatively.* The real reason Niki run out of whipped cream.
Lol at 0:30 look at the computer😂❤️ love you Nikki!
*eEg JuIcE*
Wait Niki is a girl how do she have a wife please answer me I am serious guys if you know please answer me I am freaking out
I luv how Niki tries sooo hard even tho she keep failing In Niki’s head:ugh Ik I’m good at making crepes can I at least be better than her one day In Rie’s head:I’m tooo good at this😎
Over acting
Sucks Tasty let her go.
When you say crepe it sounds like crape and its really annoying soz
Niki is Singaporean?
Am I the only one that saw one part of the Crepe Cake censored? Comment or Like if you did see it.
Egg juice
1 2 3 4...... 30 * ad starts *
I can’t believe niki is lasbian
This is Adam’s revenge for not getting fed enough
crepes are skinny legends and pancakes are *thicc*
Welcome to Tasty exposing how hard their recipes actually are
Is it just me who finds it so strange how Americans say crepe
2:10  PLOK PLOK PLOK PLOK PLOK PLOK HAHAHAHAHAHA
Rie really looks good in this episode..
Is Nikki a boy
This is like my 38473661173 time watching this
Rie is so sexy!!! Who else agrees?
Nikki is gay?’
can someone comment the link to the recipe please!!
This is how many times niki said ow😂   |   |   |   |  \/
You should let the batter sit because when you don’t the crepes will feel like rubber because of gluten
How did this penis get there?? 12:57
how did she do that fpurk fpurk (something like that) with her hand?? 1:03
i i... actually ship niki with andrew... but its ok i can end my ship now :')
U guys should make a giant melon pan...
I don’t u would need that much chocolate for the outside
How is nobody talking about Rie almost dying from choking because of the p*nis in the cake at 12:57 😂😂. I love her face after Niki says "the word", so hilarious
what niki is lasbian?
who are you guys’ favorite tasty producers? mine are Alix, Alexis, Claire, Rie, and of course Niki!
I didn't know Niki was lesbian I started to watch tasty like 5 or 6 days ago
8:02😂😂😂😂😂
70% Niki saying “Let me call my Wife” 15% commenting about Rie 10% Commenting about crepes 5% b.s.
crepes are just dutch pancakes ffs...
Rie is so smart and nice
Where I come from you eat crepes every week and literally everyone knows how to make them
Nikis lesbian?
0:10 my best friend Andrew, no its not its adam Andrew : am i a joke to you
Just a top for making crepes. When it's in the pan. Use a small Alachua and a flip it onto a bit Alachua and it's much easier
"Ohhh mother fu-fuger"
I do not think you pronounce crepe like that
4:37 King Candy from Wreck-It Ralph?
Plus They always call Rie when they dont know what to do😂
I love Rie she is so sweet.
Can I just give you my family’s crêpe recipe? It’s the first thing I’ve learnt to make and it has never failed me. 100 gr of flour, 1 egg, 166 ml of milk (1/2 a liter for 3 eggs), pinch of salt and a dash of beer or sparkling water at the end. It’s great for both sweet and salty filling and 3 eggs make 12 large crêpes.
I have to say this was one of the best imitations theyve ever done
I like how annie and andrew were spying on nikki and rie
Ries outfit is cute shes easily the nicest person who works at buzzfeed/tasty
Why does she say crepe weirdly
Lesbian ?
They forgot the powdered sugar on top
rie is so beautifull
I thought she was farting 😂 at the beginning
1 like = 1 hate Niki
Hate Niki... Kick her out of tasty videos... So annoying
https://youtu.be/w3y437sknIQ
The left side of rie’s face is too cute and the right side is sooo chic 😍😍
Woah i didnt know niki was lesbian!
Adam is the soft boi of the year
Andrew is really creepy but I like it
The definition of “your ugly and gay” haha bitch is ugly as sin
If she just added some more flour to the batter the crepes would be just fine. and they wouldn't have to make another one
Oh, Aziraphale would frolick.
Adam is everyone’s best friend
why is the cake blurred at 12:08?
This women is so relatable
I would love too meet someone who is LGBTQ+
When did she get a wife
GIANT RAIN CAKE PLZZZZZ
I made the recipe by just making a normal crepe recipe and then adding cocoa powder to it. Trust me, it actually works.
In my country we call crepes "pannekoeke"
5:53 wait *thats illegal*
Damn qure
Mom rie!
"I'm pretty good at making crapes" not so good at pronouncing crêpe though :D
am i the only one that already knew niki was gay? lol. i didnt know she was married tho.
I love how she is like trying soooo hard to make the Crepes and not calling Rie And this is what I think  You not what I’m not gonna call Rie cuz she is always better than me so ya I’m not gonna call her:3
I can also do the hand farting thing she was doing at 1:04!
Arghhh nikiiiiii ur so cuteeeee
Lol I love how rei is the mom figure 😂😂  And who gives a fuck if she is Lesbian?  Y'all chill 😂
Every time niki flips the crape, she goes ow ow ow ow ow ow...
Nicky  ( I hope I spelled it right) but she’s pretty
And I oop- Chicken souup- and I pool- and I loop- what am I even commenting :/
*CRAEPZ*
And then theres europeans judging her PANCAKE skills lol  Also why do tasty always use a cake spatula when you need a big one
Does anyone else really miss eating your feed?
Adam pls challenge ur friends to make something from India plsssssssssss

She put too much  milk
Something thats funny is my name is andrew and my little brother is named adam😂 I got triggered when she said i wasmt her best friend😂
Who else didn't knew nikki is lesbian like me  Firstly I thought she was joking around like she always does having a bubbly kind of character  But when she actually did call her wife I cracked up  But 1 thing I'm super curious she is very cute  I want to see  her wife hw cute she might be
This is pretty dumb cause you are the one who made the actual video.... Now you see it’s not that simpleeeeee
I don’t care if niki is lesbian she will always be a legend 👍🏻😀
Can anyone tell me what’s the problem of her first batter? Cause I have the same problem
I did not know she had a wife😭😭❤️
12:58 i was so focused on Rieeee. She’s so cuteeeee🥰
How much chocolate was in yhe ganache?
#ihateNiki
Nikkis lesbian
y’all don’t have gaydar wtf first time i watched a video with niki the first thing i thought was “hm ok she’s gay”
Pee
Pee
I really like rie, her smile was extraordinary
why blurred screen. 12:08 haha
Blurr on the left why? 12:08 edit: I'm the 10k comment on this vid :D
Niki is lesbian! In a way surprising but I’m not judging! 🏳️‍🌈
You say it like crape and I say crep and that triggers me
Niki are you a boy or a girl
5:07 is me when I try to follow a tasty recipe
Girl need a spootula
One time i was baking some cO0kiEs and i poured in some MaLk and it wasnt till i already had it mixed with everything that i realized it was old
I think every episode they need rie's help
Ganache means donkey. It's because a baking chef asked his colleague to do a chocolatecream and he added some cream and it wasn't right this way. So he called him ganache. It's French for donkey.   PS. Sorry if my English isn't this good. I'm a German student and I learn English in school so yea😅😅
*Rie is Tasty mom.*  *Alvin is Tasty dad.*  *Alix is Tasty daughter.*  *Andrew Tasty son.*  *Adam is Tasty uncle.*  *Annie is Tasty aunt.*
is   niki gay
12:56 Rie: Niki: Where’s the pea— there’s penis!” Rie: **silently giggles**
I did not know niki was lesbian
Show*
The prononciation of crêpes would drive my French teacher crazy.  It also drove me a bit crazy.
That's waaaaaay too deep of a pan for crapes, also none-stick like Teflon would be better than that ceramic surface you've got there.
𝑮𝑨𝑵𝑨𝑪𝑯𝑬 /gah - nash/ 𝚗̲𝚘̲𝚞̲𝚗͢ a whipped filling of chocolate and cream, used in confectioneries such as cakes and truffles.
I wanna shove my face into that bowl of ganache
You can drink milk for a week past the date
Niki is lesbian?????
Seriously, the easiest way to make crepes is with a "dip & flip"; you just dip it in the batter, let it cook for about half a minute, then flip it onto your stack. It's faster, it's easier, and they taste great!
Wait.. *Niki is a lesbian?*
Im watching this 5 times and at the fifth i just realize niki is a lesbian
Should have let it chill at the end to set the ganache.
I like her. I like rie too 😋
every time some one needs help: SOME ONE CALL RIE!
Andrew: is there a pea? Niki: Where’s the pea?
The way she cooks and flips the pan like its a trash and her emotions made me laugh so hard
NIKI ARE YOU A BOY CAUSE YOU HAVE WIFE
I think rie nikki and alix are a good team
5:58 that is amazing.
Is it pronounced crape or crepe
Rie looks like Coraline
Rie is the goddess of Tasty
12:58  Niki: there’s a penis  Rie: *cracks up*
Tasty producers be like “where are our cook tops” Meanwhile niki singing : “cooking crepes three at a time”
Gladesville she's lesbian
Wait Niki has a wife!
Sorry she is a lesbian
Nikki's gay
Why when i click on your videos u always have like 2 ads like if its the same for you too
I love how she said it's a thick layer of chocolate and she kept adding to it. 😂
Rip nikis career with buzzfeed
we love our lesbian queen niKi
I feel bad for the people making the crepes as they go along instead of watching the whole video beforehand
Me looks at this:aw poor thing she’s struggling... Me looks at Alix:Nikki is so lucky wow
Aww I didn’t know Nikki had a wife! ❤️☺️
10:21 when I pour hot chocolate on top of it
WIFE omg i thought she's straight
To make a good crepe recipe I ask my amazon tablet to show me a crepe recipe, then use the second one.     Trust me I experimented.
What if kids watch you swear
My favorites Rie Alvin Alix Alexis Andrew Niki Claire Adam Patrick
Please warm the pan and dip the pan in batter and at high flame. After 30 seconds your crepe is ready
Wait she’s gay?        OKIE NOTHING HAS CHANGE     MEH!
Rie :”you were there?”  So savage😂
Uhmmm.  Usually we work the gluten for the crepes..
какой-то хуёвый тортик
What.  niki has a wife she looks about 16 lmao
Every time an American says crape instead of crêpe a frenchman dies
Awesome receipe beautifully made 👌👌
Such a great video of failing Nice cake btw
niki I hope you and your wife have a get life together
There's the pea 😂😂
In all videos where rie is there.. everything is like rieeeeee and without rie this can't be done 😂😂❤❤❤ love u rie
Why is nobody mentioning the p*nis on the cake?       That’s pure neglect.
can we just have a moment of silence for nikis fingers?
i feel like rie is rude
I love rie. She looks like the female chef from ratatouille
I love that Nikki has a wife💜  I love all of the Tasty crew a lot!
Rie barley spoke how sad .😟
Creyp
I need rie in my life to fix the things that i messed up
I need rie in my life to fix the things that i messed up
i wish they said the recipes
Why is everyone so surprised about niki being a lesbian like it’s not that uncommon anymore plus your gaydars must be crappy because I knew she was gay before I actually KNEW 😂😭
13th times watching this video, i just reliesed that nikki has a wife. I thought Nikki is a girl
Is your pinky actually broken
13:18       And kids that's why they're name is called "Tasty"
At 5:59 it says Niki's wife. Is Niki actually a lesbian I don't care just curious.
Niki is gay HAPPY PRIDE MONTH People being open about being in gay relationships always makes me so happy
You guys should try making a crepe cake with a hundred layers!
I feel so sorry for the buggers that have to do the dishes
American butter sticks have the TABLESPOONS ON THEM?
I never knew niki was lesbian
Is that man from vat 19? At the last part?
niki is lesbian o.O
Has anyone noticed that they censored penis in this video but they’ve had videos that didn’t censor vagina?
To thick for niky
I didn’t think Niki was Lesbian or Bi bc she said she had a wife and they called her wife and I’ve never heard anything about it
"Crapes" are easy to make the first thing any kids learns how to make in my country  are pancakes (what you call crapes) Im 13 and i can make them easly
Those are not crapes those are pancakes mostly made in europe we make them at home and the pancakes that you make we call american panecakes
Andrew & Niki Alvin & Brenda  Alix & Rie   Who is the best duo?  I think Alix & Rie
Nikki is lesbian !
They might have two people working on a crepe cake to speed it up. Also. Let the gnache cool before cutting it. That will make the cake firmer.
5:55 wait... Niki is lesbian?
I never let my crepe batter sit. Didn’t know I was supposed to...they always came out great
1:55 isn’t that guy on the rundown? Sorry I forget his name
Go to helll
Go to hell niki
Notification: Niki is gay Me: tf
4:42 is the funniest part
‘I’m not being fancy,I have a broken pinky.And I can’t get egg juice on it’😹😹😂😂🤣🤣
Stop saying "crape" it's pronounced "crepe" ahhhh😂😂😂😂😂😒
Niki is now a Foods Wars (anime) character ....... well should be
Wasted lots of food
Having watched these videos for a bit over 2 hours now, I can see why Rie is so dang popular around here. I wasn't so sure at first, but I definitely like her. When someone asks her a question and she doesn't know the answer, she just comes out and says so. Its funny because I also have a culinary degree and people are always surprised when I'm all "Uuuh, I dunno." lol
I'm 10 year old but I really love you vids
I'm not a native speaker and when my sis watched this video , I was 2 miles away and heard "eating your feet" bruhh
I absolutely love the two and my heart soared when I heard she had a wife, yass!
Why is Rie so good?/ HOW😶
How much washing up?
🎶🎵noooo luummmpsss🎵🎶
Rie kinda reminds me of the girl in the Rattattoulie (idk how to spell it sorry)
I didn't expect Nikki is a lesbian
Niki looks so attacked 0:55
What it is to remake a dessert of tasty.  Conclusion:   We all need a Rie in our lifes
7:58 Oml.. that is one in a million
I WAS THERE 😮
Chocolate crap cakes
Niki is a boy or what???
Did anyone think ganache means garnish
Somebody told me to leave it in the fridge for 2 hours that’s wayyyy....different from 30 minutes😂...that’s probably why I didn’t make them right.?!...uhhuhh
Rie knows everything 😂😂😂
Poop
I didn't know Niki was lesbo
Favorite chefs  1.Alyx 2.Nikki 3.Rie
Is Nikki a boy?
How it's supposed to be pronounced: Crépe Nikki: CRAYPE
Who else got shocked when she said "my wife"?
Niki I want you to make the most popular Egyptian food
Niki HAS A WIFE??!!!
Period cake 😂

Is Niki lesbian or was that a pun?
I’ve used this recipe before and it tasted pretty delicious 🤤
Does anyone els hear that weird sound?
Is Niki Lesbian?
Wtf Niki is lesbian. Wasn’t expecting that
6:05 HAH THATS HOW YOU PRONOUNCE CREPES I WAS RIGHT ALLLL ALONG HEHEHEHEHEHE
The p*nis crepe tho 😂
I swear I have no idea what's going on but everytime I watch one of these videos all my ads are for Tasty
Is Niki lesbian or bisexual
I like the sexy music when she pours the chocolate gnash
I cringed every time she pronounced it like “crape”
Is that you, Ryland? 12:37
Yes my mom is rich she has 1 mill dallors
and the high five sound effect
She needed to screpe the crepe
I love Niki 💕
Is rie a lesbian too?
i love how rie takes over
Whenever there's a challenge I am always waiting for Rie :p
I bet BuzzFeed is stealing this!🤷‍♀️
Rie is Colette from Ratatouille
Was that really her wife??? Cause i ship 😂
Why is "penis" considered a cuss word, but vagina isn't?
I love when the chefs remake the noises the ingredients make
why did they blur that little piece at 12:10 ? (it’s on the left side)
I am not shocked that Niki is a lesbian, I was just shocked when I realized that she is already married. xD
Hey can we substitute eggs in this recipe with something ?
Watching this while making crepes
Why is she literally sooo bad at making crepes
is niki a special chef
Nikis wife 😳 I was shocked but yah she is cool 😅
I’M DEAD LOOK AT THE BLURRED OUT PENIS CREPE AT 12:09 😂😂
Why is it pixelated at 12:09? left edge of the crepe cake
wow nikies lez was not expecting that
Who knew niki was a lesbian 😮😮
niki is lesibian?
Is it just me or does the chocolate on top of the 'cake' look orange
cRaiPS
Omg she has a wife yas
Is she gay?
0:53 i was THERE
They Should make a Giant S'more
All of Tasty now should be everyone trying something on their own, then calling Rie when they mess up so she can fix.  I would watch all the videos.
They forgot to put sugar on top
Normal cocao or the Hershey Cocoa? I saw a hershey cocoa at the table
Rosanna pamsino should be a guest star in this channel
Pati Jinich posted a video of her chocolate crepe tower. But she made traditional crepes with a chocolate pastry cream spread. But I want to make a triple chocolate crepe cake! Chocolate crepe batter like Niki's, chocolate spread like Pati's, and topped with chocolate ganache like both!
Nikki is lesbian?   .......
Hold on, Americans have the tablespoon measurements on the butter??? Is that why all American recipes are in tbsp of butter??????
Is niki a boy!
niki woAH
10:29 me when my friends walk past my classes
If Niki can do it, so can i !     Says nobody
Rie is ugly but somehow sexy idk why ^^
Wife?
"kreips... Kreips"  uuuuuugh
Rie is so cute at 10:40
"I've made crepes before, Rie." Rie: silently nods her head. "Do you have a picture?"
Did she just used an expired milk?! 🤣🤣🤣 btw lets challenge adam to make one of these vids
Why do people freak out about food being past their “best before” date. It doesn’t mean that it’s automatically moldy, it just means that, companies aren’t allowed to sell it anymore.
so where is my crepe cake ?
Her talking voice reminds me of Miranda Sings.
Only a INDIAN person would know that the crepe looks like a burnt dosa...😂
Why isn’t ries back broken? I mean she has been carrying byzzfeed on her back but ok
Take a shot every time Niki says crepe
10:07 on the left side... Adam what are you doing???? 😂😂😂
ok... at home we don't do it like this at all.. first we do not put butter in it just milk, egg, mineral water, flour and just tiny pinch of salt ( cocoa by option ofc, depending what you making ;) ) mix all with  mixer (mixing on low speed and not for long other vise it will get way to much bubble ) and ready to go ..in pan only 2-3 drop of oil but that again depend on pan ,some type don't need any oil .. and that's all...like i mentioned that is how we do at home, there are ton of recipes but for me mine work for best :) tried this one and for some reason it kept sticking to the pan :(
its krepe not krape 🤣🤣🤣
11:47 I feel like I just watched porn :D
YAAAAAASSSSS NIKI IS A LESBIAN!!!!!!!!!   Same here sister 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
What type of spatula is that
*WHO WERE STARVING NOW?*
Make a video in which all the producers of tasty compete with the others and the friends should taste it     Topic :- some thing big
Wanting to impress rie, so relatable niki 😂
I feel like there is a low key hate between them both
It's because of the tasty induction cooker, it only really heats in the middle
Rie is both childish and mature ❤ I absolutely fall for her. I wish one day I will have a gf/wifr like her. Being Japanese is a bonus 🙌
That face tho 0:56😂😂😂
Bet it tastes like shit. Like all the other tasty recipes
How can niki have a wife.niki is a girl so she should have ahusband not a wife.please reply anyone please pleaseplease please please
Its too thin i think
She sounds like ellen
Nikki for me Alvin is better than u
In my country we call crapes pancakes and pancakes american pancakes and to us crapes are way more popular that pancakes  We usually eat them by spreading nutella or some kind of jam and rolling them like sushi rolls
I’m going to make this for my birthday
Why doesn’t  anyone know that niki has a wife and is a lesbian
is Niki a lesbian or her wife is
Niki has a wife ?????????
Put in in a net tray girl
Thumbs up for Rie
0:18 I am a big fan of creeps.
*EGG JUICE*
"My best friend is Andrew, no its not its Adam" 😂😂😂
i’m not even half way through the video and i already love her
*Me after watching the whole video*   Woah...she’s gay!? Awesome
The best asian duo
wdym by niki's wife??
12:02 That clap looked... BIZARE!!!
LOL.....this is eating your feet.
Wait Nikki is lesbian
Idk how many times I’ll watch this video and comment.i enjoy watching Nikki.i love u Nikki
When you added more cooktops it reminded me of a game i played called cooking fever (you should try it😝😜
Crepes are better if you add rhum or beer in the recipe. 😉
when u fail many times then make a brown d#ck oof cooking fails though not offending
Who does the dishes?
the reason u couldn't do the crepes is cuz u did full fatmilk instead of skimmed. yup. u definitely forgot what u were saying.
How many cups of flour did they add ? Edit : did they mean 3.25 cups ?
Could I challenge you guys to make a Chilean Thousand leaf cake (Torta de Mil Hojas)?
Rie is the amazing one always .... 😍
Rie is always there to save the day 😅😅
This is literally just “buzzfeed fabricates and the recipes don’t work”
I tried to make this. It took ALL DAY! it was yummy and lasted me a while but it definitely got a bit soggy which was expected
Nicki:"I could call my wife she can tell you" Me:( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) (oh okay wife=husband) Wife:He- Me: *⚆ _ ⚆*   PS:No i am okay with niki's marriage but i didn't expect that..
who else is just binge watching tasty??
Îs so goood
A a a a
Fuckkkkkkk you NIKI Fuckkkkkkk you
Niki is lasby
Niki: I've made crepes before Rie! Rie:*nods with face full of doubt*
"Ouchy mama" 😂
Niki calling her wife gave me LIFE.
i hungry.
Niki is ugly as fuck
How many hours does this process take?
You forgot the powdered sugar
12:04 I’m offended cause you missed the clap
5.55  Me:is Niky  a boy? Mom:no she is a girl  Me:then why did she tell she is gonna call her wife?  Mom:what😠😠
Niki is lazban
I felt like I have seen Rie on a video where she was dumpster diving
My best friend is Andrew hahahaha no it's not it's Adam   RIP:Andrews self esteem
Bruh I got a tasty commercial before this vid
What do they even do in Buzzfeed when their not creating a video
Wait Nikki’s lesbian because that’s cool
Who else doesnt pronounce crepe like cripe like if you dont i am acc cringing
My mom is better then at making crepe
"Ouchie mama"
i love how niki goes " i can call my *wife!!!* "
Rie looks like the girl in Ratatouille
I made nuttela bread crepes i used a shaper to cut the flat bread and i had a mini crepe amzing right!huh huh...
niki is gay?
I love how she’s like “I’m great at crepes, let me call my wife, she’ll tell you!” like that would be an unbiased opinion, LOL. 😆
4:28
Whenever my crepes start like ripping I add another egg cuz it’s usually not stable enough to stay together. I do 2 eggs, 1/2 cup flour, and like 1/2 cup milk and 1/2cup water and if it isn’t runny enough I add more water
It looks like a ***is I never meant to do that 😂😂😂
crepe cake dick😂😂😂
Wait is nikis wife like kelsie from buźzfeed cuz it kinda sounds like her but I swear she is single? Can someone tell me
I’m drooling and craving unhealthy food     Our house doesn’t know what unhealthy food is lmao
1:24   Me: -_-  Niky:I hope they are rich.  Me: ...I wish they had that in any other continent than America. LIKE FUCKING BRITAIN! 😲😡😠
Every buzz feed worker ever: adam give me video ideas  Adam: **gives idea**  Every buzzfeed worker ever: aDaM cHaLLeNgEd mE
Rie is a professional she take easy recipe to the next level
"Let me call my wife and she'll tell you I'm good at making crepes." I cracked up.
You and rie look alike
when i cooked something good me: 2:55
I feel so uncomfortable about niki’s finger 😰😂what’s with her pinkie finger?
I keep getting Niki and Rie confused.
i dont know why they had to blur out the crepe
I like how they always bring Rie in it😍😍😍😍
WHEN RIE WAS LIKE WHERE YOU THERE?????? LOOOOOOOL I LOST IT
Was excited to watch the video, then heard her pronounce crêpe "crape".
Marry me <3
Wait is Niki a lesbian
Niki is kinda annoying. 😒
Crepe: Like Crape: Comment
Adam is so adorable 😄
I like it...thanx
Wait what niki is a gay she has a wife
I love Rie and Niki's dynamic
Did at the end when they said penis... Me too...
Make roti sai mai
I was stupid enough to make it for brunch today It was worth it, though
I’m enjoying this show so much
What is crepe
I love how awkward the high five was
Hi
Nikky s cool n funny
When i saw the pan i knew straight away the pan was wrong !!! Im french and when we went to the usa we used this kind of white coating pan, big no no !!
oUchy maMa
The girl who entered with andrew, her face looked like she didnt like it at all
10:07 *Adam just looks at the cream*
niki: let’s use less cocoa powder  rie: lesbian
Her: Let me call my wife Me: Well let Me call mine first ( still a Fiancè tho )
I want to eat this so bad but there’s no way I’m gonna be able to convince myself to make it 😂😂
Nikki: Saves a pen*s shaped crepe to show Rie 🤣🤣
I put on 30 kgs watching this video
who love crepe cake
When she says andrew my best friend Andrew- :) Wait no hes not its adam Andrew- :(
Why is Niki such a MOOD.
Actually the type of pans been used is as important as the portion of floor/ eggs & butter.
Wait niki is gay????
egg juice
She was just wasting batter after a while lol
7:18 *Moto* *Moto* *has* *entered* *the* *chat*
Haha just tried this 1/10
why is she so obsessed with lude images when shes lesbian
This bitch is lesbian and she has no shame in saying she's going to call her wife
7:09 like wiwi thicc
5:07 is me when I try tasty videos
*Andrew left the chat*
The way they pronounce crêpe makes me cringe. Then on the other hand it would sound similar to their word „crap“. It basically rhymes with „step“.
Is crepe pronounced crep ay or c rayp
12:57 ria's dying in the corner by the way that' s my guess on how you spell her name
She is lesbian oof
she's lesbian omg i thought she was straight
i CAN'T BELIEVE SHE IS LESBIAN. THAT'S WHY SHE ACTS LIKE A BOY.
Is this not to be rude but for it to be easier use a flatter pan and use something wider to flip the crepes😊
Is niki lesbian?
I’m still shocked at how good my intuition was in knowing that Nikki was lesbian just by watching her in one video
Next time less cute and more baking. Also preparation won't kill you
Niki: "If someone makes you a crepe cake don't take it for granted, it took them all day." Me: Makes a perfect cake in less than an hour. Me: All day?! I did not know days were less than an hour long
Nikki is so adorably cute!!! I like her a lot🥰🥰 and I also like Rie. They are so cute together and I laughed a lot with them. I hope their friendship last for ever!!! Is really beautiful for what is shown on camara. Is funny how she called her wife to resure herself that she is good making them. I personally dont like crepe and I eat them in Italy but I didn't like them at all!! For me their taste is awful 😅
Anyone else think Niki would make a wonderful addition on Steven Universe?
Rie's hair looks like rays from promised never land :v
wait niki is lesbian!!!!!! {im not sexsixt}
WHERE THE LGTBQ+ AT!!??
Nikki' WIFE??
Wait wait wait.... NIKI HAS A WIFE????? whaaaaaat?... mind blown... I mean its not bad.. but I am just super surprised
Is Niki lesbian?????
Powered sugar?!???
Rie is brutally honest in a cute way and That doesn’t make any sense 😂
If she had more cream at 10:34 why couldnt she whipp wore to add the remaining 6 crepes
can we apreciate that one brief moment when andrew **cough** i mean adam popped into the screen at 10:07
Who knew she likes a girl
I FRIGGIN LOVE RIE
I usually make crepes with equal parts milk sugar and flour in a half cup for 1 egg, comes out sweet and easier to control, replacing your tsp of salt for sea salt after cooking is a nice trade off
Is Niki a girl or a boy?
nikki sticked her proud creation 12:08
Rie is probably my favorite human ever
A tip for future reference, it's much easier to make crepes on a flat top griddle than in a frying pan.
7:24 i like them biig i like them chunkay CHUNKAY
man this looks so good hehe
I am eating crepes right now
oh my gawd niki has a wife  thats so cute  my gay soul is dying in a good way
Rie is so adorable. Hope she's not an SJW
{\__/}  ( • - • ) / > 🍰
I’ve been shipping niki with Andrew....
karma lel
{\__/} (  ._.   ) />♡  Love      I know i copied it i was trying to make it so dont care
Wait... Niki’s a lesbian?
I didn’t know niki was lesbian
She’s a lesbie
*_chunkyyyy_*
She said eating 3 times in 5 seconds
12:01 *OH IT LOOKS SO GOOD* **misses high five**
I made this.
Is she lesbian or bi?!
10:50 Niki's face 😂😂
4:42 Ouchie Momma
(灬♥ω♥灬)  (┛❍ᴥ❍)┛彡┻━┻
Is she lasbian
Is also someone annoyed by the way they pronounce "Crepes" ?
OUCHE MAMA
I luv rie
“iVe MaDe CrEpEs BeFoRe rEi”
You can’t test your own recipe that not right.
i think 1 million of these views are from me. i’ve watched this video SOOOO MANY TIMES IM NOT EVEN KIDDING
__  -- • √ - (-- --)
It's so painful to watch americans making Crêpes 😂
7:19 i like them big i like them chunky
Ahh I love the way Niki says "crepe cake"
She didn't even thank Rei for helping but she's still cool I guess but ya know
My dream come true!!!!!!!!!
Nikkies gay?!
The fact that they’re sensoring the crepe piece
Anyone thought Niki was straight?
Is niki a lesbian
I'm so glad Niki called Kelsie! Every time she fails, I want hit the giant invisible WIFE LINE button where Kelsie just shows up and cheers for Niki :)   Since y'all apparently missed the memo: search "Wedding Season", where you get to see the entire process of Niki getting ready for her wedding.
Go ouches is just another way of saying sauce how does a chef not know that?!
Kelsie is probs jealous because she’s hanging out with Rie all the time XD
I love this show, but I honestly can't watch Nikki.  She is so grating.
Where does she see an a in the   word crepe? She is saying it crape
Niki: Look at how lumpy this is. *CHUNKYYY* Rie: *That's why we straaaain*
wait she is a lesbie...
Once i was cutting chocolate and my hand hurt so I took a break. When I went to cut the chocolate again I had accidentally started cutting the chocolate upside down...  Ya...
Why is nobody acknowledging that Ries crepe batter worked???
10:36 I love Rie's little shrug >~<
i love rie but alexis should have come to help cos she’s really good at making crepes
Guys! Stop.. who cares that Nikki is lesbian? What's ur problem. ?? 😑😑😒👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
One day expired does not mean gone bad.
RIE!!!!
I'm wondering who wash all the dishes?
I like how the p*nis is alway censor on the cake
What so she’s gay?!
I love to see how their friendship got stronger over time 💖
Niki is married what?
I like grapes 2
It might have been an accident in the editing or maybe it’s absolutely fine to leave it that long but for anyone at home making this I think u only need leave it to rest for that 30mins to an hour not 11/2 hours. Love this video btw looks so yummy👌👌❤️💜
It was easier for Alexis to make a crepe cake with a clothing iron. A CLOTHING IRON!
Go Niki! :D
Niki ,You are a woman how would you have a wife you should have husband right
please turn the pan so that the handle of the pan is facing the opposite side of you so that you don't knock the pan over:)💛
Im NOT trying to be fancy i… have a broken pinkie and…… I can't get EgG jUiCe On It
0:52 my whole childhood...
Niki acts like Rie’s daughter kinda 😂
Craips my ears are bleeding 😶
Is dat girl lesbian cuz she said she called her wife
For anyone who watches Lachlan, Muselk, LazarBeam, or Craytor:  Rie=Fresh
The minute she said wife my crops were watered, my pores were cleared, and everything was right in the world
Niki is gay so it doesn’t matter
Dose ur pinky just break all the time or
While I was making Crepes copying the recipe I didn't notice but I have the same exact spatula as R E A when she was trying to flip the crepes
10:40 Rie love.
Come on making pancakes is not that hard
Omg..... milk is not going to go bad if it's only one day past the expiration date. Lol You should know this.
You can try  making savory one as well! Just  don't put sugar and cocoa in the crepes   and use cream cheese, mayo, olive paste, choped scallions, ham and chicken breast as a filing. To make it pretty you can  drizzle a bit of BBQ sause or marinara on top. It's amazing!
Chocolate srepe cake is my favorite ist very populare in serbia
7:59 0.25x slowed, thank me later
Ya'll idfc if Nikki's a lesbian or not the fact that she is married and I didn't know is really fucking frustrating for me-
is that 3.25% milk tho
What is lesbian
Niki and Rie are the BEASTies of Tasty🤣
4:39 " motherfudger" hahahahahah good one
I like that everyone cares more about her and her wife then they actual crepe cake lol
70% of comments = NIKI IS A LESBIAN?!?!!1?  30% of comments = Rie is the mom of tasty producers  0% of comments = actually good things about the video/funny quotes/literally anything else
This should be called “let’s rely on Rie”
Omg I love Nikki so much she makes het videos so fun
I made this once and i almost burnt my house down xD
I love Rie she is my food Wifu
She did it wrong. THEY SAID 4 WHOLE EGGS.      *YOU NEEDED THE SHELL.*      Its a joke chill.
I am new to eating your feed or buzzfeed in general and I'll just say this: Nikki has a wife!?!
Guys. Niki's laptop literally say 'queer' on the back.
Rie's a bitch but, like, in the best way possible because I love her
You have nice work partners, I want to be in a workplace like that. (I wanna be an artist but you probably don't care)
someone make a remix of her saying ow and huh
The fact that I just found out niki is lesbian is just🤯. I thought she was straight. But still I love her for who she is not for who she likes😁.
My new favorite tasty producer (I dunno how to spell btw)
Tasty mom
Nikki has a wife?
Loved niki's retelling of the princess and the penis.. something so magical about hearing a childhood story with a twist 😂
OMG A PENIS
niki has a wife??!!
Who is finally clicking after seeing it in your recommendations so much
Ouchi mama - nikkie,2018
is niki GAY?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is nikki a lesbian
I love it 8:41
Lesbian
I meant lesbians
And you are a girl
How do you have a wife
Gay
I thought "crepe" was pronounced "creh peh"
Ez egy palacsintatorta
WOW I THOUGHT SHE HAD A MAN NOT A WOMAN
NIKI IS A LESBIAN I DIDNT KNOW THAT
It’s not crépe it’s crèpe
rie is waifu
Rie is the best chef ever
Niki is gay ?
*ahem*   Q U E E N  R I E
Im a big fan of creeps XD
Me we I’m cooking
Y r they saying crape its pronounced crepe not crape
Niki's wife is so sweet when she calls her up
I watched this video a thousand times and I have never seen her broken pinky or heard her said it
Bless whoever edits these video
I LOVE RIE OMG
ANDREW GET AWAY YOUR NOT HER BEST FRIEND STOP TRYING😂😂😤😤
I didn’t expect Niki was lesbian...
does nikki having a wife change who she is or something? come on people
Please don’t tell me Niki’s gay T-T
I thought she said here name was dicky 😂😂😂😂 (not a hate comment)
lmao its pronounced crep not crape XD
Love love love Rei.... so cute.... always the life saver
It’s actually pronounced “crep”
God I hate Americans so much like everything they represent
Crepes are the sad, flat version of pancakes. Change my mind
Why is everyone surprised about Niki being a lesbian 😂 they literally made a whole series with multiple videos about her getting ready for her wedding with her wife lmao
10:30 when I find out food is involved
idk ifits just me or does he legit look like sebastian stan at 12:35
3Crepes, 3 crepes at a tttiiimmeeee😂
One little thing my grandma told me, is to firstly mix milk and flour and then add the egg. If done in this order and whisked proberly there are no lumps ...
I’m Belgian (i speak french) it’s not pronounced “crapes” they are pronounced crehps instead of “apes” EHps” 😂 ok hope you understand.... 💜
%% Z
I made one the size of commercial sheet pans like a decade ago. This side would be soooo much easier. The struggle is real.
Woah woah woah nikkies a lesbian woy
Who here pronounces crepe like creep or crape
No one is talking about why part of the cake is censored at 12:08???????
Niki's wife seems so nice 😊
Love you girls! So much fun you two!
Every bodys surprised that niki is lesbian but I'm surprised shes marriedd!!
The princess and the pea...nis
IF I HAVE A GENIE WISH. I WISH TO MARRY RIEE
She looks exactly like jp from hellthy junk food
if you make this for brunch, i will remember you.   will you not remember me for just this?!   nope.     lmao
What's with the censor @ 12:08 ? XD
Can Adam get challenged to cook something??? Please
My dad made this for christmas last year. SOOOOO good!
Just making some crapes... Don't mind me here.
Who wants a cake? {\__/} ( • - •) / >🍰 Cost = 1 like. Edit: Thanks for buying my cakes.
Not gonna lie I love skim milk well all milk but skim is best.   I come from a family (of me my sister and mother) none of us drink chocolate milk I love chocolate ice cream but chocolate milk ew
I think it's hilarious how Rie basically tells Niki she did everything wrong but in a gentle way😆😆
Young people who love fancy food but have no idea how to make it
Who watches this garbage.
0:54
12:20 Looks good!
Wasn't Anyone else like whoa when they found out Nikki is a lesbien
I was laughing
reminds me of torte de chili desert
wait she has a wife? never knew she was married guess i never payed enough attention to see a ring on her finger haha
Does anyone else eat the crepe cake layer by layer. Its satisfying
12:10 look at deez nuts
12:04 **miss**
Why do people from tasty drink from a bowl so much?
Lol Nikki is really lesbian they already married
She’s high as fuck
Is it just me because I pronounce crepes as "creeps"I dunno why 😂
WIFE?!?!  ARE YOU A LESBIAN?
Rie is carrying
You don't know your best friends name. 0:10
Try whisking the eggs with sugar first then incorporate the flour
Niki is lesbian
When I heard of crepes I thought it was grapes.
Am I the only one who thinks the batter is too thin?
Niki is a lesbian
That cake is more likely to be named as chocolate mirror glaze crepe cake
I think moto moto likes you. I LIKE THEM BIG I LIKE THEM CHUNKY
5:10 me when I’m trying to poop
4:24 sounds like she is eating seaweed
PEAnis HAHAHAHAHAH
Niki: this is such a thick layer of chocolate!   *continues pour chocolate on top*
I'm sorry but they even struggle with their own videos 😂
It is c-re-p not c-rey-p
I have a question. Do you normally put cocoa in crepes, or is it just for this video? In Czech republic we usually don't put it in.
OMG I love you Niki.  You make me laugh at the end of a very long day.
hey straight up what the heck could be being censored on the final cake
Nude batter 😂😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm just waiting for someone to say "Eating your feet"
adam is great
Okay but why is part of the cake censored
Rie is the cooking master
I swear to god rie is like their black knight and i love it
Rie the tasty goddess
Niki is a lesbian what?!
Rie is like a really sweet version of Colette from Ratatouille.
The moment 5:55 came, i freaked out.
Is niki a lesbian?
welp actually! you should try *expired* foods! its not bad it's better than not expired i'm too lazy so this will explain *EVERYTHING* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1rZAT2GtmI
12:04 Did they just add in that high five sound because I didn’t see any contact, 🤣
I already loved her, but now I know she has a WIFE.    I love her even more
please make nama royce chocolate!!
Ugh why everytime when I get these notifications I'm hungry!! 😖
Is that girl lesbian not trying to afend anyone
Its crepe not crape

OMG WAIT NIKI HAS A WIFE?! MY LIFE IS COMPLETE
I didn't knew Nikki was lesbian
Nikis wife??? Sooo niki is a lesbian ??
10:38 I have that scale too! I don't use it in the kitchen though..
Rie looked like she was SO not having it when she came in the last time.
That was amazing!!! you were determined!! I loved your tenacity but you gotta get something to flip them your poor fingers...that looks delicious and gorgeous I am definitely going to try this thank you!!! never give up!! Great fun video :D
I never known that Niki likes girls
Chocolate pizza
I’m low key in love with Rie lol
Please make soft pretzels!!!
Niki's wife?
My older sister says crepe like *CREP AY*
Nikis lesbian?
In my contury crepes are pancakes
4:59 "New measurement, bye eye" lmaoooo
Niki is lesbian
Wait so Niki is lesbian?
Rie carries
How much chocolate did you use for the ganache?  Update: I just tried to make it... it fucking failed😭😭😭😭😭 generally so upset because it was all fine up until the ganache which ruined it because it was so thin and wouldn’t stay on the top of the cake
to me crepe's just looks like a pancake, because here in Denmark, our pancakes are flat like a crepe
Replay 1:03 in 0.5 playback speed    Lol
You’re missing everything if this show doesn’t continue 😭😭
all the rad chicks are lez.... too bad for us hetero dudes
12:57  Theres the pen--- Look at Rie! 🤣
Why was Niki saying crepe like grape... *say it like rep*
Rie is so good and professional it scares me
niki: Hold On Lemme Call My Wife me: 😳  my subconscious: NIKI GOT  A GIRL??!?!
Does it bother anyone else when you can see the other camera?
Niki is lesbian!?!?
Half of the comments are with the wife thing and I’ll just do this: “I think it’s doming” “Yeah I think it’s doming too ADAM” Adam...*vine reference*
Rie is the tasty savage mom
Nikki why so inappropriate
Speshari an riri think
8:41 is now my new favorite song😂
Niki looks amost like Alix seriously
Did you know that you don’t have to flip them if they’re thin enough?
my mouth is watering
who else was wanting uncensored pics of that crepe
Rie reminds me of that girl from ratatouille    EDIT: OMG I NEVER HAD THIS MUCH LIKES BEFORE THANK YOU!!!
wait...... Niki has a wifeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee? I didn't know that, well... i know now xD THE MORE YOU KNOW
Take a shot every time she says crêpe
I need more friends like Niki and Rie in my life
#CREAMWATCH2018
why is everyone best friends with adam??
I made this after the buzzfeed layoffs came out because i love niki so much and i needed comfort food! (i added coconut flakes on every other layer and it was NICE!!)    Niki, you will be seriously missed!! I've followed all of your series on Buzzfeed and I will follow you wherever you end up! Love you so so much!!
Rie is the best chef
enak
Shout out to the people who knew Niki had a wife from the "Wedding Season" series. P.S her wife is gorgeous. 😃
No
0:55 is me internally and eternally
Rie is always there when you cook
She too lazy
Anyone else say it like creps instead of crapes
I love you guys! 😁
12:03 they missed...
Hi tasty  You guys are using a lot of eggs i only use 1 egg to make crepe an it come a lot and it tast it so yummy i only use  flour,1 egg ,2or3 sugar big teaspoon and water only no milk or butter.  Either way gone try your recipe👌. Thanks💋
Niki is gay???????

Isnt it „best before“ on amarican products? So why shouldnt it be good after that day?
IS THAT METAL IN A TEFLON PAN😠
0:56 how do u make that face 😂😂😂
The thumbnail pic looks soooooo yummy!
Nikki’s wants Senpai to notice her lmfao
Wait....she has a wife?! I love her😂 I'm gay and I would never think she had a wife😂
I wonder who washes all their dishes.. thats a lot
NIKI PINKY
I looooove her and I love this video!
Hold up, I ain’t judgin’ but is Niki a lesbian?
When Niki said my wife my little queer heart went 💓💖💘💕💘💗💓💞💗💖💘💕
Is niki lesbian
Niki saying, “my wife” is therapeutic tbh.
I love how this show is basically Rie and her 4 kids. 😄
Who is better rie or alvin
I was today years old when I found out that niki has a wife
Rie Friend Chief extrodanry Measures in cats Is awesome person overall
How does niki has a wife  niki is a woman  is she  married to another woman Woman and woman I didn't understand
Niki is gayyyyyyyy iwwwwwwwww
Nikki is a lesbian but still act like a girl
She’s a lesbian?
How is Nikki married to a girl
Am i the only one who found it so cute when Andrew ate the crepe cake at 12:42?
Rie is such a sweet bean we must protect her. ❤️
Okay. 0:32 WHY are they giving credit to THEMSELVES?!
😋😋
You forgot the powdered sugar
This is the only area of buzzfeed I can tolerate
So i realized that adam is like their taste tester at every “Eating your feed” video
The flipping with your fingers fills me with concern.
Replays 1 like for 1 replay  0:00 0:00 0:00
I only now know that Niki is straight up *not straight*   I support her very muoooch🌝
Andrew is sad lol
I ship rie and niki
Waitt. Niki's lesbian??
5:54 Woah, that was unexpected.
Make the 23 layer Michael Jordan cake
wait when did she get married? why didnt i hear about this?!
Would it not be easier to use a griddle
Kraypay Not Krape
Everyone just loves Adam, huh? xD
BYE NIKI :(
niki is a lesbian
Milk can be drank, if it was kept in the fridge. For up to 3 days after the date
Wait Niki is a lesbi**
It honestly would have been perfect if you used Dark Chocolate for the Ganache, and you let the cake sit on the fridge at least 30min.  Good job tho
Sometimes I forget Niki’s gay and I was very delighted when the screen just showed “Nikis wife”
I didn't know Niki was a fellow Gaysian!
“One at a timeeeeeeeeeee”
Nikki and Rie are amazing!!   I laughed so hard when they blurred out the penis. I just wasnt expecting that.
Americans are so awkward, either call it a pancake or pronounce crêpe correctly
Too many rejections in one episode. Andrew got rejected as Niki’s best friend, and Niki went unseen to eat crepe cake with Rie. Oof poor children.
Im crying pure queer angel tears :,)
*aDaM*
The dick on the crape cake thooo
at 6:10 the sound of them saying craip is starting to sound like nails on a chalkboard!!!! :)
I remember making 100 crepes...
If the original video was from tasty, why didn't she just ask the person who made the vid for advice?
Niki is lesbian
When your fat but don't care: 12:10
Me when I'm at school: *hey look it's my friends hi friends* 10:30
do an rainbow crepe cake nikki
Nikki is gay? She called her wife.
What did rie think bout da pp?
i wonder how often Rie gets interrupted from doing her actual work to like having to go to the studio and teach people shit
when i see people dont flip crapes throwing them from the pan i feel like they are doing it sooooooooOOooOoOooo hard :P You should do a flip vid where you learn to flip and toss food to a pro level;)
In Holland crepes are pancakes 🥞 the key of baking crepes is using a big spatula and you have to go around the crepe in the begin
10:08 we have a peeked under the counter
I wonder who washes those dishes .
7:13 Rie's 'Trust me, I'm a chef!' face.
1:04 my mum would yell at me to stop farting when i do that.
how the whole series go *starts of trying by their self then fail *  Andrew and Nikki "lets call rie"
Where can I find the recipe?
her original batter was like,, 100% liquid,, not good
5:58   calling niki's wife..
Nikkei is gay
Lets challange adam to make something for once? haha
those cooktops are also garbage, so that doesnt help.
The sound of her smelling is a dope 😎😂
Yooooooooooooooo its rewind time
Omg it is 1 am and I’m starving now
I forgot she was married
Who here hates BuzzFeed but loves Tasty
Wait Niki is lesbian?! I wasn't expecting that.
In Britain these are just called pancakes. Every 5 year old learns to make them with their grandma
Its so annoying that your saying crepe wrong everytime!!!!
11:34 you'll thank me later
Can they not say penis?
Nikki's a lesbian NANI!!!!
Only Rie looks very normal and hard working. This other gal In red top has a weird face and a very teenager attitude. Immature adults.  Only Rie is Why i like tasty channel.
How did you break you pinky?
You’re using the wrong pan!
She says it the wrong way the whole video, wow *french headshake*
i wonder what was going through the head of whoever first milked a cow "This animal has nipples I wonder what happens if I squeeze them"
Why she has a wife?
I really just wanted a whole montage of her pulling them off and saying ouch
10:31  It’s funny how everyone just watches each other cook and stuff.
is  niki a boy?
Is it just me who annoyed at the way she says crepes
I has no idea she was lesbian. Good for her. Don't let the haters get to you.
Why nikki lesbian?
Is Niki gay ????
i LOVE it when they put classical music in the background, it just takes me to a whole other world 😍
i LOVE it when they put classical music in the background, it just takes me to a whole other world 😍
i love Rie
i don’t want no hate but she’s annoying
hearing women say “my wife” gives me an unexplainable joy
what the SHE is a lesbian!....... she is a girls type of person but she is a lesbian......shoot with that!?!?!?!?
rie is cooking mama
* accidentally made a penis  “ I HAvE tO ShOW ThIS To RiE !”
10:31 that face behind andrew
SHES LEABIAN??!!
Please,I Eat
12:11 There's a twist. we find out that Niki is actually shrek and the cake is onion.
i do the hay thin and i make the exact noises XD
I LOVE HER WIFEU~
Dude, it's just a crepe. How on earth can that be hard.... O.o In Serbia we learn how to make those when we are, like, 9. lol
Is she gay ?
Why are they not allowed to say penis?
Everytime im in a tasty vid rie is always showing ._.
What’s with the censor on the left side of the cake at 12:09
Adam the brave lol
Niki is really annoying. I love Andrew and Adam!!
5:50 that face though....
"Its too wet on one side" *ThAtS wHaT sHe SaId*
Anyway my finger tips are pretty much BURNT
Grapes
It sounds like she is saying geapes
Wtf wife??
Rie....you are soooo beautiful.....:)
wait what nikki is lesbian?
I love Nicky she’s so funny I can relate to her
Whoever is lactose intolerant, your body would not like this
I think it would have been way easier flipping crepes if she used a more shallow  / flatter pan. The batter was too thin for sure. Other than that, good job!
The way she says crêpe really makes me want to pour drain cleaner in my ears and hang myself
Wincing for how many burns she must have gotten on her hands
Cooking fever more pans
I made 50 layers in one hour my first try.... What the hay?
Niki is a GAY! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
RIE tasty mom
call my wife wut
Dang I can’t even make a good cup of water😔
Ouchi mama  Lol 😂
How the fell Nikki has a wife ?? Les..... ????
That's cute! Crepes in Paris, this whole video is just sweet XD
i loveeeee cake
It's Feb 2019 now, but did Niki ever actually make another crepe cake for Rie ???
When Niki roasts Rie’s recipe she’s angry lol she’s not used to getting criticised
*ouchie mama*
Lesbian?
I'm not even like an amateur baker or anything, my cooking/baking experience is relatively limited but even I could see the first batter was too liquid. Every crepe Niki took out of the pan still looked like it was still dripping and then she went and added more milk! Not saying I could ever do their job better than them lol just something I noticed and I just always get so into these videos.
I wanna work for Tasty but.... I love all the way in the UK 😭😂
'I have a broken pinky and I can't get egg juice on it'
Rie basically just helps everybody while occasionally getting her own videos
I'm rewatching with mixed feelings cause I know Niki already left Tasty. 😭 I'll miss all the sounds she makes, and her chemistry with Andrew, Adam, Annie, Alix and of course, Rie! 😭😭😭
It’s not crapes it’s creps
ok so i love tasty but aren't these kind of videos just proving that they're recipes are super difficult and never work?
Maybe it is the tasty pan smh
I keep my crepe batter in the fridge for 1-2 days! It drastically increases the flavor and texture!
5:54 Niki said I can Cll my wife😧She is girl How would she have a wife???
Rie is wife material honestly
Why do they pronounce it like "crape"??
"No lumps" my high school name
.
I truly believe that the pan is the problem. The edges are too high and the crepe isn't cooking evenly. It is cooking faster in the centre than the edges, that is why it is collapsing on the edges. Just my opinion. My crepe pan is wide and flat, and my crepes always turn out bomb.
BRING THIS SERIS BACK!!!
6:06 The most suspense I have in my entire week so far~
If at first you don’t succeed try try try again 😋👍🏽
Haha crepes look like Norwegian pancakes
niki is lesbian lol
yo for some reason i thought it would be 100 layers
Rie makes everything better.... 😄
12:45 Why is part of the Cake blurred out?
Am I the only one that noticed she stuck the penis on the side of the crepe cake at 12:08 ??
Can’t wait for the season 2
wish i could ship niki and adam:(
wish i could ship niki and adam:(
ohlookitsmyfriendshifrieeends
The levels of emotions... Make crapes.                    I'M HUNGRY
Americans make crepes so hard   And they say it weird
niki :((((
Niki is like the diva queen she’s already a diva too
How do you even get lumps in crepe batter??! Like it never happens to me you must be doing something wrong
Only here because Niki got laid off and I’m the saddest person alive.
the problem in the beginning was prolly the stove lol isn’t that tasty’s own product  someone did a review n said it heats unevenly; the middle is a lot hotter than the edges and that’s exactly what happened here..yikes
Bloop bloop bloop bloop
CREEEEAP🤣
The amount of times she pronounced Crepe wrong is actually hilarious!
Why does she pronunce crepe like that lol
Wait what?wife?
hearing niki say "I'm calling my wife" made me so happy! also congrats on the crape cake
gayyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rie is a god in this show whoever needs help call rie
6:00 Nikki is lesbian?THAT'S SO COOL!!! *0*
1:31 I am Xd
The real reason to get a spouse is so you have someone to call as a witness
I love Niki and Rie
I can see nikki is a girl who doesnt know everything but pretending      Just my opinion though
Looks delicous and i like it when you made fart noises with your hands
NIKI IS MARRIED??
Niki is so funny!
Nikis lesdian??
Cake actually looks delicious😋😋😋😋😦! Now I've never even heard of a crepe cake but I definitely want one
8:06 *accidently draws dick * *shows it to Rie *
wow nice looks delicious
5:54 *OH*
11:43 Rie looks so concerned and happy omg lol
Niki has a WIFE?!?!?!
Mm crepê
I tried to make it and it was really gross I did it wrong 😭💀 it took me like 3hours
I love rie
Niki is a lesbian . I wasnt expecting that 😂
lol curse word in beggining
Wait.....is she... Nicki is Lesbian??
Was she joking about having a wife?
Is it weird that I smelt chocolate for a fraction of a second
Niki has a wife
It’s not bad but I didn’t know
Wait niki’s lesbian?
Off topic comment but like wtf I just puked in my own mouth for no reason
Don’t say pain in the a_s not trying to be rude like if u saw her say that
It's because you're using the crappy induction cook top that your crepes didn't come out right the first time. The tasty cooktop has a heating element that only targets the center of the pan making a huge temperature gradient from the middle out. A gas burner would have been better.
Shes so cute😂
12:57 Rie’s reaction is me trying to laugh quietly at midnight on a school night in my bed (Rie is amazing btw if you didn’t already know lol)
Haha
Rie is so mom 😭
Who else knows niki was lesbian
Crepe cake=mille feuille
Niki: what if this doesn't work? Rie: (smiles)
v
6:00 what the fuck is this
*Egg juice.*
Who else is here after watching Kennedy washes video
Its painful watching this when your lactose
Who love alex and rie
rie looks like the chef from ratatouille in a good way
11:14
honestly, Rie is a god. but she just could not keep her composure with the you know thingy that was stuck on to the side of the cake. she lost it          God these people.
“I’m pretty good at making crepes I never made a crepe cake” I love her
I didn't know Niki was a lesbian Awesome! I'm glad to see some accurate lesbian representation in the media
No lumps
1:04 lol😶😂
I'm English and Oh My God, them saying crAYpe hurts IT'S CR ```E``` PE
Do u say crepê like crape or crep?
when i found out she was lesbian i was like OH HELLL NAAWWWW
5:59 Nikki’s a boy!!!!!!😱😱😱😱😱
Just the way you say crepes is the most annoying thing in the world I have people that say it that way it’s so annoying ahahah
OMG niki is lesbian!!?!?!
Am I the only one that likes niki’s crepe cake better than the original? Just me.  Kk
That’s delicous :))
pause it at 0:55 her facial expression is so funny ! not tryna be rude
Wtf is a crape
I love nikki’s personality because she is sooo sooooo funny in this series😅
Rie is the mother of the set
adam is the type of guy who recycles his own ejaculate
The thumbnail is me when someone doesn‘t laugh when I say A joke
*Imagine she doing the 100layer crepe cake*
Niki is Lesbian or her "Wife" is lesbian???

Niki is lesbian?!? NOT THAT THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT I JUST DIDNT KNOW SHE WAS
I’m pretty sure crepe are just the original pancakes but then Americans made pancakes so fluffy and thick so now their pancakes but original version is a crepe          ?
7:59  this crepe should be made by a guy
Rie is like the most adorable person on Tasty.
12:08 why they censured that
RIE HAAHHHAAH CUTE
honestly this show is so awesome like all the people are so nice.
12:42 he looks so surprised about the crepe cake 😧😧😧😧 😵😵 👀🌌
11:40 it's looks like pancakes 🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍯🍰😛😋😂😃😄
Yeah the problem was cocoa powder bcz it is very water soluble so it desolved easily and u should have used all flour+cocoa powder and if it was too thick u could have added more milk
When you think it’s gonna be easy peasy lemon squeezy but it’s difficult difficult lemon difficult
YOU DONT NEED TO BUTTER THE PAN.
AT 0:14 THERE IS THE FINISHED PRODUCT
It look like a penis
Hold up milk is a lesbian i nearly started watching this and I already know too much   I don't have anything against it
Who else just found out Niki was a lesbian?
Rie is good at everything 💖💖💖
Can i just say.... *where can i get those whisks*
I wanna see nikkis wife she sounds so sweet
She is the worst person they have doing these little lame ass shows
2:30 I wrestled the state final tournament with a broken pinky stop complaining
I’m Irish and we don’t say craips we say creps
When Niki impresses Rie  🥳
i love niki
Why does Niki always have something on her left pinkie?
Is Nikki lesbian?I mean there's nothing wrong with that.Im just shook.👀
I am a Big fan of Creeps!!!🤣🤣
What is pixilated out at 12:10?
I hope the one that does the dishes for tasty gets good pay
Rie is so serious about everything! Haha
i was actually eating crepe cake while watching
In any video that BuzzFeed does Rie is there. She’s always helping with something.
I've made it... and it's soooooo chewy.. it taste fine.. but i don't know why it became so chewy.. i want that soft texture
Lol you’re a femenist
Love you rie  💖💖💖💖💖💖
But it's now 2019
4:36 when you stub your toe But your mom is watching
Wt* Nikki is a lesbian who else got shock when u new she is a lesbian
I didn’t know Niki was lesbian no hate
My BFF is Andrew! Wait... No its not! It's Adam! Well then. Just kinda discarded Andrew there didn't ya.
awe rie forgot their brunch :(
Crêpe it's not "craype" it's "krep". Or at least that's what I know..
Did anyone else notice the blur on the left side of the screen at 12:08 - 12:11?
Does anyone think watching people cook is relaxing?
Rie is rocking those denim jacket <3
why the fuck is her pinkie broken
“Eating,eat, eeeting,eeaaat
who would have a wife if your a girl
niki's lesbian? wow i didnt know...
I didn’t know you were suppose to let the crepe batter sit...
Me when i wach a tasty videos 5:07

god damn she have  a wife .......she is a lesbian
I cook better than both of them...       oh wait... dat a lie...
I replay so many times and I still love the food!
Wife?!!!😯😯😯
Lesbian?????
that moment when you miss the high five
is nikki gay or is she a male
6:00 wait- I FORGOT YOU CAN MARRY WOMEN NOW HKLTJLR6;K
In Italy the butter sticks don't have the measurements on the side
Yo wife???
My wife? lesbian
eating your feet
I don't see why Nikki made a big deal bout chocolate. I dont mean to offend people who don't like chocolate but chocolate is not a big problem on any cake
Nikki: “I think I can handle more then one crepe. And Tie will be really impressed with me.”     Me: NOTICE ME SENPAI
Below the pan. Thats what you do to do it perfect.
Egg juice wonder what dat would taste like lol
Niki's wife is that a mistake during editing
Hey hey hey !  Try making a video on re creating the ultimate rainbow crepe cake and make sure only Niki in this vid and rie idk hehe I like vids where niki is on cuz she is kinda entertaining and fun !  Oki bye ! Huehuehuehe
Just feel bad for whoever has to do the dishes at the end  🤭😂
I love Rie and Nikki they are like sunshine they make me happy, warm and fuzzy inside
Hai toe i challenge you to make biryani in air fryer
Shes lesbian
Nikki's fails are both fun and sad LOL....... but Fun LOL. She needs someone else to save her hahahaha
I laugh at 4:42 it was so funny to me.  Niki: ouchy mama 😦 Me: ... Pfffftttt HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Rie is awsome.
Why is niki gay huh and why is rie only her friend can't they be best friends!?!?!?!?!?!?
Who thought that niki was girl
Is Niki lesbian
She is sooooo cute
11:59 that’s what she said
That whisk tho
the problem she was having with the crepes was because that stovetop isn't great. it's only got heating elements in the very centre and isn't cooking the edges of the crepes.
That ‘s why I love Japanese people<3
Rie is like a mom 😂
So many Dirty Dishes... I feel so bad for the person that is gonna wash that😂
date isn't expiration, it's sell by date
rye is just so knowledgeable and down to earth. you can see she's very hardworking!!
Someone explain why her computer says 'QUEER'
Is she gay
Sorry if this sounds rude,but Nikki’s LGBTQ? I’m sooooo sorry if that sounded mean
Oh mother ffff-father 😂
I heard..."This is eating your feet!"  .......ha.....
*Rie is Tasty mom* _Everybody wants to impress her_       Credit: Izzy
OMG AHHH NIKI HAS A WIFE I SHIP IT SO MUCH YASSSSSS  I did not know dis ;w;
Umm... Niki have a wife ? But she is a girl (No efense) Your vidio is so cool to see !!! >^<
I thought she farted HAHAHAHAH FML 1:04
I have made this before and I am very high praise!
Egg juice😂
Rie is always coming to save the day😂
I love the way she says ganash.🤣🤣🤣
Lol. My shirt says 'Oh Crêpe!'
Hey my name is niki
you're using the wrong kind of pan, you should use a cast iron pan that doesn't have rounded edges
ganache  a whipped filling of chocolate and cream, used in desserts such as cakes and truffles.
I see all the comments about Rie being ‘tasty mum’ but I beg to differ, no, Rie is not Tasty mum, but Tasty GODDESS!
Omg crepes. I slaved away trying to make a perfect crepe cake for my mom’s birthday breakfast. Then I made my famous macarons and everything was fine.
Is niki is lesbian omg
It’s not a crape it’s a crepe
Rie <3
When she said cooking crepes 2 at a time I thought she said ‘Kokane crepes’😂😂
I didn't know Niki is lesbian...
12:09 why is the right side of  the cake blurred out ?
Ouef rip andrew
12:03 imagine without sound
Rie is my favorite person in the whole internets: google chef
Her voice sounds just like Maranda Sing😂😂😂😂
why does nobody know how to pronounce crepe smh
12:10 What is that censor?
OK, Niki deserves a medal for this. Kudos to wife - excellent support!
I love the Tasty crew.
0:55 and pause. Look at her face. So funny😆😆
Is Niki gay
Wife?
Terrible
0:02 me at english exams
yours with no chocolate on top looks like pancakes lared on top of each other
.??????
She's lesbian
For your information the correct recipe starts at 6:38 before that there  is just talking and failing..
Who does the cleaning work?
Once I heard Niki calling her W I F E I immediately went to the comment section like if u did this too
Why Does Rie Appear In Every Video
so she is a lesbian?
I like trains
When I saw this I thought it said "chocolate CREEP cake".
The date written on food packages is not the day that it goes bad , it's actually the day they have to be removed from the store shelves and the product is still good for like a week after the end of that date .
Niki is a Lesbian??
isnt it read as KREP? am i wrong?  im still wondering why people read it as crayp
that thumbnail... welcome to the future subliminites
When did niki Get lesbian
Rie is so beautiful.
No lumpssssssss
6:49 Niki: I've just been doing everything wrong. My whole life! Me: Story of my life, sister... 😂😂😂
That's such a thick layer. *continues to pour more chocolate*
who else search for Niki's ring when she called her wife
Seeing her suffer is my favorite part of this video(just kidding)
I love rie she is amazing
How did she break her pinky?...
I love crepes,like is you love crepes
Niki is so adorable. I could watch her videos all day. MORE NIKI VIDEOS!!!
reminds me of Mabel from Gravity Falls
4:17  Niki:hhhhhhh Me:XD
12:57 DID YOU MEAN PEA-NIS
I'm hungry i wana eat this ;-;
Rie is the best
Oh look it’s my friends! Hi frienddddsssssss.........:) lol
So niki likes gurls coment if i am right
Niki has a wife?! Woaaah cool
The fact that her fingers are burned won’t make her wife happy...     if u took that in a dirty way that’s not my fault.
Rie 💓💓💓
I know I'm late but in Hungary we have crepe cake, but with totally different fillings. We make a layer of grated walnut+sugar, then a grated chocolate layer, then a marmalade layer (possibly made of apricots and not melty fake jelly) and a sweet cottage cheese layer. Repeat untill you run out of fillings or crepes. Smear sour cream to the top, sprinkle with chocolate and bake it in the oven. Also for crepe we have a totally different recipe and it's stable af.
Is it just me who was getting annoyed at her saying pronouncing crepe as crape
is she lesbian
Is niki a woman or man???
Wife? Wtf surely that's disgusting 5.57
I want Nikki as my friend
There's no pea... only a PEAnis lololololoololoololololololol
Regular crepe + any chocolate spread = easy life
The date on the carton is the sell-by date, not the expiration date unless it is.
I love how Nikki just doesn’t care, she’s just like “yeah, I’m gonna just call my wife.” The confidence!
Whenever I make crepes and they fail, (which is a lot) I make it into a scrambled crepe. 👩🏼‍🍳😝
Rie is good shes a good chef
An expiration date isnt that its gon ‘’bad’’ it means that its giving you a recommandations of a date that the company isn’t sure the product good still (does that make sense)
Rie is like my favourite person
This just made my day. I can cook things just fine, but anytime I'm being watched or making food for someone new, everything goes wrong. So glad it's not just me
that is please. i wrote plese by mistake
is niki a girl or a boy? anyone plese reply
I'm flipping Crepes Three at a time I'm flipping Crepes But it sure takes time
Niki is a he or she??
Litterately everyone in tasty: *i think i need help * **RIE POPS UP**
I would die for a bite of that
But I'm a "craype" I'm a weirdo.
Crape Equals Grape
Why is everyone js talkin bout Rie and not the actual chef/baker which is Niki..?
If you have never have a crape,reply to my comment saying yEET.
She is so nervous
i never known nikki is lesbian...
I was eating an orange when 13:02 I almost choked
I love rei😍
Rie should be the tasty mom like if u agree
Google search results: what does *ganache* mean:  It means ganache.  I am terrible at explaining.  I'm just gonna say that... *ganache is ganache.*
When she said “my best friend is Andrew” I was like I have a friend Andrew too “wait no it’s not it’s Adam” WHATS WRONG WITH ANDREW HES COOL
This is how we make pancakes But whitout chocolate
It’s NOT pronounced CRAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who else noticed the failed high five at 12:03
Niki have a wife so niki is a sexual?????
Nikki is such a contrast to Rie - Rie should be in every video, shes so talented and cute!
"My best friend is Andrew, no It's not its Adam"😂
My mom made a tea flavored crape cake and a chocolate on too :)
WIFE????????????????/
5:11 mood
We stan Niki calling her wife.
If Niki has wife Niki is gay
The stove!!!!
I feel like she should have put some powdered sugar on top with some whole strawberries, that would have completed it
*_Sorry i was late! I was getting this_*  (  \ / } ( ^o^ ) (>🍕 )   Btw i love this channel! ♡♡♡
1:16 as son as she said "what was i saying" i couldn't stop laughing for 5 minutes >.<
https://bit.ly/2S9Tzd7?-fat-loss-cardio-workoutttt
"crape"
Rie is my fave chef, I tried one of her recipes and it tasted really good
I need new season of this series
Niki should make her own channel :v
I wish I worked here
Just a tip for crepe making: don't use butter on your pan. Use cooking spray every time you want to make a new crepe
She's a les?
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE MORE OF THESE VIDEOS I LOVE THEM THEY MAKE ME LAUGH I LOVE RIE I LOVE YOU PLEASE MORE!!!!
Omg her broken pinky! Respect to her man.
Wait, lemme get this straight nikki is a lesbian?
You like creeps, You Make Creeps....oh their crepes
Niki is lesbian? Not hating but just make sure
Rie in a video: *exists*  Gets 1,000,000,000 views
My mum used to make Durian crepes like seriously, it tastes good
She's a BIG FAN OF CREEPS ...........m
I rєαllч ℓσσσσσσσσσσνє  ᴿᴵᴱ
For sure they spent bucks
3:28 her accent tho
Rie is so amazing like everytime i see her in videosi press them videos. Shes like a person you want to meet even though you know nothing about them. I wanna hug her lol.
Andrew looks like he just woke up
who else didn't know niki was lesbian and who else was shook because whos more iconic than her
Someone needs to make a remix of her small song #makingcrepestwoatatime
Who else is craving this?
0:55 When your crush completely ignores you
I love how she loves crèpe but can't pronounce it correctly at the same time (not that it's a bad thing it's just the "americanized word" i just find it funny)
Why don't you use a mixer? Crepes (we call them pancakes in Europe) are always mixed with a mixer. You just throw in some eggs, flour, milk, sugar, salt and carbonated water. It's super easy
just got a 11 min advertisement without any skip...i hate my life
Who else thought niki wasn’t a lesbian  Edit: thanks for 2k likes Edit 2:thanks for 3k likes
That's a lot of crapes it's pronounced creps
I don't like crepes...
2:25 that untouched pile of flour on the left side of the bowl is hurting my eyes..
Take a shot every time she says ow
what Nikki is a lesbian??????      Cool
“ADAM!!!”
"ahhhhhhh"  Me:"omg!!!!!" *laughs
Rie is the Queen of Tasty!
0:21 Niki : I am a big fan of crepes ( sounds creeps ).           Me : Guess what? I know thousands of creeps sitting at those british or japanese bars!
its crep not crape
I think you can creat anything
Just made this I love this
CAN WE GET ANOTHER SEASON
5:55 Just lost a lot of repect for her
jkjk
Did Anyone feel like rie was annoyed by nikki
Flipping crepes is awfully easy. You just need to be brave and commit!
10:30 ohh look it’s my friends hi friends!
i just relized that nikki has a WIFE not a husband
7:58 "Oozed like a *****" You had one job 😂😂😂😂😂
Number One Rule:  “Keep your station clear! Look at this mess!” Colette, Ratatouille
Me during finals: 9:45
I lovvveeee Rie!!:)❤️❤️love from Sg 🇸🇬Singapore

Alvin is the Tasty dad he Is the best because he never gives up
I love how Rie is so quiet compared to most people at buzzfeed

Rie should be my culinary arts teacher

This series should've been called "Feeding ur feed"
WHY IS RIE SO ADORABLE!? OMG!!!!
Two *things* of cream

This is how u say crepe crep
Wait, what? Niki is a lesbian?
U guys are having lots of fun, wish I was there to test.Love  it.Keep doing something new.All the best  dear
She made a p****
Wife?
12:58 *Rie has left the chat.*
Make chessecake
ganache means "fool." it was invented because this one patisserie accidentally but too much milk into the chocolate. turns out the head patissier liked it, and made it a menu in his bakery
8:02 It looked like a *censored* so they blured it out xD
I have a crepe maker xD
I FUCKING LOVE NIKI. I ASPIRE TO BE IKE NIKI
Oh      y✨ e✨ s✨
Is there like a pea? No- but there is a penus.
In 1:24 , where i live the butter does not show how many tablespoons there is  😭😅😩
S2?
Last year when this video came out was the week I broke my left pinki too!!!
Drinking milk makes it pretty easy to tell wether it's ba dor not, and it's less likely to hurt you because it's pasteurized. Never drink raw & unpasteurized milk, though, that's a pretty bad idea..
"Wait, are you there??"  I've heard this many times before.
is niki a lesbian she has a wife like whattt
12:14 anyone see the blur on the left she didnt cover it all with chocolate ha
i'll marry Rie right now
*Niki is lesbian*😱*
Pause your video then 10:50 look at her face 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It really irks me the way she calls them ‘ Crapes’ instead of ‘Crêpes’
It's always funny watching Americans try and make crepes
She’s using the wrong kind if pan, it’s way too deep
12:59 Rie was dying of laughter 😂😂😂😂
4:08 ı no longer feel crepe about this.
Hould on a secc Niki is lesbi???
Sour milk is actually better for cooking and baking
Rie is like Bish it will work 😂 7:12
Rie lowkey reminds me of the chef from Ratatouille
I love Niki!
she is a lesbian???????
NIKKI IS LESBIAN?
is niki a lesbian?
It’s funny 😄
I pronounce crepe as creepy.
The penis hahaha
Rie kind of looks like the really good chef from rattatowe 🐭🍝 and also the suit maker from the incredibles
you just know all those rich kids watching this felt sick hearing that the milk was 1 day out of date
Rie is like Edna Mode  who bakes
Niki is Gay
11:40 I... am.. cumminng
I’ve never heard someone say “crape” instead of “crepe”
Wait she is lesbian?
Rie is the best at Tasty
wait is niki lesbian?
“I can’t get egg juice on it”   Ok we weren’t expecting you to put your whole finger inside!
Niki is lisbien
I she a gay
May I know how much chocolate you use in ganache?  Thanks
Um what do you mean by a girl wife
why is it pixelated on the left side @ 12:08? Penis again?
Is she lesbian? Just curious
I was so irritated by this girl and then she called "her wife". That explains a lot.
I didn't know Niki was gay aka I have no problem with gays
0:20 i thought she said *shes a big fan of creep*
Why is a part of the cake censored? 12:08
Niki is a mood 😂😂😂
Idk why but every time I see Rie’s name I want to pronounce it like “Whry”
Wait.... Niki is lesbian?  Yay
Wait.... Niki is lesbian?  Yay
Niki looks gorgeous in this video
Your crepe Was too thin the first time My auntie and mum make crepes all the time
Niki is the lesbian oh shit
10:23 Love this moment 😂
I didnt mean to do thattttttttt
is america gay?what is america?is america fuck?
My question is how many blisters did Niki get? 😂😂
Her:ohh look it’s my friends! hi!
Who else got an American Express ad with Alexis in it.
Its pronounced crêpe not craype
Okay but how can I make these without burning my hands, I’m not really looking forward to touch a hot pan.
Rie! I missed you!...(that sounded weird..) Rie! One of my fav chefs Hello! (that's a bit better..)
It really sounds strange hearing the american pronounciation of Crêpe, but probably, trying to pronounce it correctly would sound too similar to crap xD
Watching these high r an experience
Rie is the best ❣❣❣
That passive aggressive bitch keeps blaming Rie lmfao holy fuck
Here in sweden we make pancakes the same way you make crepes. And at kids birthday parties it was very normal to have a "pankakstårta" which is what you are making except normal crepes and and strawberry jam with the whipcream.
hard to make crepes with induction
I was so pissed they didn’t use all the crepes to make the cake ):
Wait, whats the amount of the choc for the ganache? (I really wanna try this)
Rie's voice is soooo cuteeee
Did she say her wife what are it she a lesbian
Why did they edit a high five sound at 12:03 and they missed the hand clap like they don’t wanna touch each other.
that was awesome
is everyone at tasty gay
Nikis wife? Am I a woosh Or Niki is a woman Or Niki is ......😱😱😱😱
She's so annoying,and now that I find out she's lesbian  I want to die.
Niki has Wife
See gold00:1
I'm pretty good at making crepes so that whole thing actually looks pretty easy, however....  in my opinion, crepes only taste so-so.  I'm not sure that I'd love this cake.
Fuck crepe Give me the chocolate 🍫
why did they censor her saying penis though?
At 12:57 rie’s laugh made me smile so much
Nikis lesbian !!!??? WOW!
Rie is always in these and I love it 😂
Egg juice
Do you think Rie gets stick of being asked to help people bake
As soon as i knew she's lesbian, i hit the dislike button and close the video immediately 👎
Rie is a Tasty legend
9:03 rei does half the work and she is like......yaaaay u did it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣internal feeling of the other women be like.......no i did not...what  ...what😂😂
Is there one tasty producer who can work without having Rie "just in case"? Ist soo cute, she is the only one having her cooking shit together
Niki, I think you’re supposed to spread the ganache with the spatula...
Shut the fuck up ya Asian ass
Chocolate pancakes
I make crepes every Friday and also pancakes //PEACE
The Americans must be stopped. 'crayps'? It's 'creps'. They are taking over
the way they're saying crepe throughout the video is slowly killing me.
I thought she farted
Fun fact - in the UK we don't have the tablespoon marks on the side of butter. This fact was fun for you terrible for me.
Question: Are all the tasty people chefs?
I watch this 20 times because i like tasty because i get food ideas whith these and nikki and andrew has a good team and they made a mosserella cheese
Haha the call Rie for everything. XD I like Nikki she is so cool
Crape - _-
11:53 when you see it 😂😂
And shes lasbo....
Rie is so cute
never seen a fat asian b4.
Tasty inception
If anyone doesn't know this then please read this might help you make a crepe cake easier well not super easy If you accidentally folded the batter...or crepe thing you can use a paper towel to put it back in shape but you have to move quickly  So instead of starting over because of accidentally folding it you can just fix it easy trick😉
Oh you lovely Americans say Ganache so beautifully but butcher crepe.... hahaha.
I didn’t know niki was lesbian
*I* *love* *RIE*
Is Niki lesbian ?
Rie is so damn sweet❤
I get so happy when they finish and are successful!😂 I really want to work at buzzfeed!♥️🙌🏼😂
Rie is tasty mom
at 12:10 why is there a part of the cake blurred
Ouchie mama
4:37
I don't understand how they make crêpes look so hard to make ! As a french person I grew up eating and making them and it's honestly child's play like I just don't get it 😅
"I hope you're rich."   Seriously.
I was watching this and I was like Niki knows what she is doing 😂😂
What happend to nikis finger
I used to blend em to get rid of lumps
where you there?
I never knew Niki was a lesbian... (I'll still love her tho)
Nikki reminds me of my sim making garden salad
And I the only one who actually thought crepe was pronounced like creepy? Yes? Only me? Ok...
Roses are red  Violets are blue  There's always an Asian better than you
Oml this is sooo FUNNY LOL gimme more of this stuff

When in doubt, call Rie
Rie and Niki are so pretty
She looks like Rie’s daughter...
Why does a girl have a wife

Ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffudge-
Rie is thegoddess of coooooking
CREEEEEEE PE NOT CRAPE PLZ not hate im sorry
0:58 Rie looks dam board
Okay... um... who pronounces “crepes” with an “ay” sound...? And who pronounces it with an “eh” sound...? I know there’s a proper pronunciation but I want to know who says it the way most people say is wrong (with an “ay” sound...)
Rie kinda looks like a young Japanese version of my cousin, especially with the hair
Every episode of nikki tryin to make somethin she ended up callin on rie😂
wait is kelsie lesbian
Niki, are you a man or a women
Is NIKI a Lesbian
I like Niki
we stan a gay queen
I think Ganesh means chocolate in Russian
Rie is too pro lol
ITS CREPE NOT CRAYPE
So...niki is lesbian?
When she says crepe it sounds like “grapes”
“ I think I can do this “ then 4:53 happened
Whut.. What you people call "crapes" is freaking called Pandekager in danish (Where I come from) which means Pancakes..??!!!
Ahahaha egg juice

There really good at baking and cooking so I'm not  surprised there getting this😄great job it looks awesome
Why are they having such a hard time making creps it's really easy, but there getting it so that's good
I think I sprained my pinky toe 😢
My life:  🤟🏽😝🔫        |        |      /.  \
They Should be left the gnash for a while to harden, it wouldn't have run over the inside after she cut it
I hate her
It’s funny how she pronounces crepes like grapes
I want crepes now ahhhh
I tought she said "I like creeps"😂
Niki seems rude to Rie tbh
I sometimes want to be Rie's daughter.
Rie is low-key God in this show
The expired milk made me cringe.
Is niki a boy? Cuz why does she have a wife? Or is she lesbian?
ouchie mama! *youcihe mama*

I love this video so much this could be in a comedy or satisfying section of a video
Am i the only person who felt annoyed with the way she talk?
You mean pancakes?
Why does Niki`s cake look better than the original to me?
It’s not crape it’s pronounced crep
Wait did she said Niki's wife? Is She lesbian
I want the camera man's job. He's always one of the first to taste 😅
wtf,niki had a wife? She's lesbian?
Lol why was part of the chocolate blurred
The boogie man is coming get ya 👹
If someone makes you a crape cake, don't crepe it for granted.
Try to make pho
5:51 and 10:40 rie so cute :3
2:00 the mic on the left
Did any of u guys get rlly annoyed at how she was saying crêpe?!?!? I am!!!
It's like every time I watch tasty I always get hungry
I thought he was a girl. :P sorry. And Rie looks exactly like my mom.
Is Nikki a lesbian? 🏳️‍🌈 Not being offensive I just want to know. 😁 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Niki is a man or a woman ?(No Hate/offense )
"What's that one story of the mattresses with the pea under it?" Theatre Kids: "ONCE UPON A MATTRESS!!"
She’s lesbian?!
11:52 HOW DID IT GET ON A PLATE HOW
“Cookin crapesssss, two at a time” 🎵
I love Tasty like if you agree it’s so good.
When is this series coming back? i hope soon
That kinda looks like the thousand layer cake I ate...
i love rie..she's good in everything
Is Nikki gay just Asking?
Why do you call crêpes  like the word "grapes" ? I understand that the word is sound like crap, but please pronounce it correct.
People ask me, why is my name is spelled as N-I-K-I
Niki is gay what!!
Is niki gay
I watched this video 3 times and I just noticed that she has a wife
lol 12:09 is blured
wife?????? really so done with this.
This is what South Africans  think when they watch this video:"Damn these people don't know that crepe is just the fancy name for pancke😂😂." Shout out from S.A
4:37..."Ouch Mother Fudger😂"
stop at 0:55
9:53 The way she said "Yeah I think it's doming too, Adam." kinda sounded like Miranda Sings! XD
Niki's LESBIAN?!?!?!?!?!??!?!? 😐
Gnash isn’t like..pronounced Nash but the g is silent??
Why didn’t you follow the tasty  video recipe
Is she lesbian?
How Niki can have a wife
12:58 Niki: there's a penis Andrew: excuse me
Oh my love, Rie!
"Ouchy mama"            -Niki
I so confused. Is tasty and buzzfeed thr same thing!?!?!?!

I WANT SOMEEEE
My friend: hey man, NO OFFENSE BUUUT ME: *says it with voice to make you pee your pants* if its offensive,  DONT SAY IT! My friend: okay buuuut Me: I said it once I wont again
Damn, that looks insanely deliciious. I want one
1:30 We want to keep this a PG
The matter with them I think is the pan, because in europe we have a special pan only for making crepes, it has very little to no edges so it's easier to flip them
true clowness to the core 🤣
The way she says crepes makes me feel weird cause i pronounce it like crep
Guess who’s back, back again. Rie’s back, tell a friend.
I didnt know she was lesbian I live Itttt
Rie is so funny lmao
12:04 that high five fail. (Slow it down)
Automatic dislike when she called her ''wife''.      We all know there's no such thing as ''wife having a wife''
Did I just hear The Lick at 5:28?
One time I had skim milk with my cereal that had gone bad and me and my grandma didn't know so then I made hot chocolate and noticed something was wrong and then I notice IT WAS BAD MILK
Shame on you do u know how hungry this makes me feel
@1:24 After scouring Google, I think I found the answer here: the "quantity indicating wrapper", US Patent No. 2159997A, invented by one Stephen R Millar in 1937. At least, that's what I *think* that is.
I'm out off cream. MORE CREAMMM..........
Rie. I love you.
Rie
😋
I hate how Americans pronounce „crepe“.
Rikky is like she is too shy
I love how Niki is just like “I’m whipping my own cream”  I mean it’s not that hard I’m just that lazy lol. Imma be like “0k at the store... WHIPPED CREAM great! I’m done here.”
Niki FORGOT THE POWDERED SUGAR ON TOP
Wait so Niki is lesbian?      No hate I didn’t know it. I don’t have anything against gays or lesbians.
Is nikki lesbian
🎵 "Cooking crepes, two at a time"🎵 its so catchy lol
did they edit a clapping sound in at 12:03? i didn't see their hands touch that well enough to make that sound
Ganache is french and means mule
It is not a fucking CRAPE. ITS PRONOUNCED CREP
8:40 ~ cooking creeeepes two at a tyyyme ~ 8:50 ~ THREE CREPES THREE CREPES AT A TIME ~
Is niki lesbian
*OUCHIE MAMA!*

https://youtu.be/uZVnGiCMzgE
Is Niki lesbian??
Wait nikis a boy why does he have a long hair
Nikki's cake looks better than original 😄
craips
There is actually a little tool for leveling the batter in the pan. :3      Hope dis helps
can we see more of these two? they're so adorable and funny
Did she wash her hands!?
Look for her video of pancake art. That video has all the info you need.
How much time does it take to do this?
Niki
She is a lesbian what the he'll nik8
Why is there a part of the cake where its censored???
12:08 I see that blur.

Wife????????
Its not crepe its pancake just not american ones
4:57..more flour will be better... Edited  6:00..Told ya hahahaha
Lesbian love    I like my own comments
You gotta wait a bit for the pan to get pretty hot. Take it from my franch momma aka crêpes master 😋  Also, crêpe batter does thicken over time. Just add milk :>
Why wife not husband
Wife???!!!
I make meme plz no kill meeeeee She gay this video no good no more
Niki has a wife??
Dude is she a comedian?
Niki is meeeeee!!!! 😂😂
4:16 huuuuuuuuuggggghhh
niki's husband****
Isn’t that the wrong type of pan for a crepe?
normally the batter is more thic and no one flip the crepe
In Europe aren't tablespoons on the butterpacks because we don't use that stupid measurement system
12:10 why the pixel
What a dam clumbsy ding bat she's a professional chef? And she's touching her hair dribbling sounds like she's spitting making sounds fart sounds with her mouth lips as shes handling food
Niki is asian Laurie Metcalf
Lesbian
SHE PRONOUNCES CREPE WRONG SKDJD

0:19 "I'm a big fan of creeps"

Crepes are British Pancakes 🥞
YYYYYAAAASSSS GAYS
Me and my sister call Crepes pancakes chips
I love cooking but i hate doing the dishes
For me ,as a German Girl,it's  uncomfortable to hear how they pronounce crêpe. We pronouce it like the French's do. 😂
so much asian
i like the way rie says *THICK*
CRÆP
my school is doing this fundraiser for a 5 POUND CHOCOLATE BAR    YAY DIABEATES

Niki is so clumsy but she's aMaZiNg
Ganache means fool or idiot
Tasty>the rest of buzzfeed
When is season two coming out
Wife, what wife
Rie's face Nicki said she has made them before was like nah u lying
She should get an electric crepe pan instead
Niki's one looks way more delicious than the original tasty video.
Niki is a girl or boy
Ilove you to 💜💜🌸🌍
It's the eggs, she used only 4
nvever knew niki was les xd
I didn't know she was married. She looks so young. Plus I shipped her with andrew
7:58 penis karma to the lesbian lady xD
the best thing is to get diarrhea after eating that cake with outdated milk <3
Wait she has a Wife... WHAT... Im Confused 😕
You have been stopped
creape cake euheuheuh
I think everyone needs a Rie in their life to guide them through
I think everyone needs a Rie in their life to guide them through
Captain here: Ganache means idiot or jackass in french. That's what the confectioner said to the trainee, when he accidentally added milk to the chocolate
jölli
Adam and Andrew are my daddies.
When Niki called her wife i felt  disgusted
I think Nikki could be possibly the funniest person I have ver watched on YouTube. She is so witty and funny!
Andrews my best friend no he's not Adam is LOL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh look it’s my friends! hiiii friends
Is it just me but have never ate a crate
Does anyone know nikis instagram @?
I think that Nikki is really cute and talented
Me 10:29
*egg juice*
I just put all ingredients in bowl mix all with mixer so there's no lumps and then you put just a little bit of vegetable oil in pan and wait until the pan is hot and then you put the batter in pan and you wait like 1 min or less and then you flip with spatula and you get a perfect crepe
12:04 that high five tho....... (NO HATE)
It's was a mistake letting my dad cook. - - - - - - - He lit a pancake on fire...
Cr ep e
Niki is boy
Wow... Niki is LESBIAN?!? I never knew that...
YUM!
At 12:09 what the heck is blurred out on the cake? 🤔
Batter tip: Don't whisk it. Use a blender. Its a lot faster and more consistent. Also let the batter rest for about an hour after you strain it
Why isn't Rie my aunt?  (This comment is for fun oof
Rei being done with Niki's shit is my aesthetic
HEY WHERE SEASON 2 AT😭
Rie the tasty mom Niki the tasty daughter  Andrew the tasty son And Adam the  tasty dad   Tasty family?
GAAA NASHHH
انا من الوطن العربى من العراق
I am not a professional baker at all, but I think the batter was too thin...in fact, I’m not a baker AT ALL, I just looked st the batter...
Every time she says crepe or crepes take  a shot!
you know who’s beautiful?       me.
8:01 cracked me up "it looks like a penis"
why dont u make 100 layers of crepe cake?
12:08 why did they blurr something on the left of the cake? Guess there was a gap in the chocolate but still seems silly n tryhard...
Is nikki a boy or a girl? Please tell me. I am so confused.
Niki is literally me talking about ginash
i dont want to be that  guy but its pronounced "crape"
Rie is stupid!!!
Is niki lesbian or not why does she have a wife?
Is it just me or does she has a very annoying voice?
Who the hell add expired milk in a batter?
Sorry if i made you angry
Can i ask you? Niki have wife?she lesbian?
She reminds members of Jen from Ladylike for some reason
It’s hard watching these kind of videos while dieting 💔
Great song at 8:40 Niki!
her first instinct was to call her wife. if ur relationship isn’t like this, ur relationship is cancelled.
Make bubble milk tea !!!!!
You know when to flip it if you shake the pan a little. A cooked crepe should unstick, a raw one should not.
Y don't u just use a crepe pan its so much easier
why do they strain the doug ?
I wish rie could make my life decisions
Her wife???????? Shes already a girl
Thats not how you eat a crepe..
Was watching and enjoying until I heard who she was calling
She annoying
Resting your batter helps with the emulsion of the ingredients
How did she break her pinky?
can you guys please make one for my birthday september 11
Milk can last ten to fifteen days after the experation date.
Oh my god, Rei Kinda looks like the lady from ratatouille
10:30 oh look it’s my friends, hi friennnnds. 😂😂
I love how niki tried so hard not to swear😂😂
3:36 DWl  lol ROFL
She’s a lesbien
Unsweetened cocoa powder, right?
Niki's gay!
6:40 Final recipe
Tasty trying to make tasty food recipes........  WE'VE ENTERED A FULL CIRCLE
Oh she's a lesbian... 😂 ha gAy!
It annoys me how they say crêpe
#loveislove 🏳️‍🌈❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Wats craypes???
12:10 anyone else notices that random blurring? no just me, ok
My mom thought it was crapy cake
We don't deserve Rie. </3
Poor pinky award goes to Niki
Of cource rie's resepie
Love the rainbow whisk
the princess and the peaness  brought to you by brazzers
Fun fact: niki is actually lesbian
Noob
I actually NEVER knew that Niki has a WIFE
Lol I showed this video to my mom and she said, I know who tasty is! They make videos on facebook!
I watch these videos and I just wonder...  Would Rei like me? If not, what can I change about myself?
So tired
"OH look it's my friends hi friends"😂for some reason I found that funny
really hate how she pronounces crepe so hard to hear
I hate feminist so I hate you
I want to work in Tasty..... 😂😂😂
lmao the thing is in Europe atleast in Croatia our pancakes are like crapes just a little thicker and a lot of people just take oil put it on a hot pan,put the crape liquid on idk how to say some things sorry,then we just flip the pancake by throwing it in the air and catching it with the pan(need a super thin pan),and we call ur pancakes american pancakes and they are known for being thick as hell😂
Andrew and Annie had two options when they saw Nikki baking:  1. Help  2. Come back later to eat it  They chose option 2😅
Hate this dumb ass bitch
In Russia a crepe without the cream,  is basically a pancake. Called Blinchik
You're irritating me by saying crêpes wrong
8:31-8:48 Reminds me of that one video of Chris Hemsworth trying to eat soup. "*sip* It's so hot. *sip* It's still hot. *sip* It's still hot. *sip*"
Ogres have layers as well
I wish u can reach in the screen ans grab some crepe :'3
4:46 hahahaha
Omg when she called her wife to prove she is good at making crepes 😂
FLIP
Niki is LESBIAN
Please make jappaness cotton chesse cake
The thumbnail was weird! But still I'm here
It pronounced 'crep' not 'crape'
how much chocolate was in the ganache?
from what i know, you’re supposed to let crêpe batter sit in order for air bubbles to leave it. if there is a lot of air incorporated in the batter, the crêpes will tear easily :^)
Is ANYBODY here from Sas-ASMR??
Everyone is saying how Rie is like a mother  And Im over here just appreciating the recipe and eating the crepe cake I just made...
It's pronounced crep, not crape
Maaannnn!!!!!!!! Nikki is married and a lesbian. Nooooooo
Love Niki!!
niki was gayyyy brohh but he like a girl OMG im very Ridicoulous:v
Waste of my time until Rie appeared.
' I can call my wife' ☺😐😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲 I thought she was straight no offense though
Crepes are just thin pancakes in Lithuania
Is Niki lesbian
Wait see a lesbian wait aaaa i cant dhjebeveirvrrf
Wow....so much bloody effort for crepes. They don't need to sit and y'all need to invest in a crepe pan.
Niki is so pretty I cry
Your personality is amazing!
My favorite part is “nice and smooth and”no lumps
My favorite part about this is “ well rested batter”No lumps”nice and smooth”
Me and My 18 years old sister can make much better than niki
I never made crepe like this... I think your crepes are too fin
Now i'm hungry
NOOO ADAM DONT DIE
its called mille-crepe cake
She can’t pronounce crepe. It’s driving me crazy!!!
Pause at 10:50 😂
Did she put sugar in the whipped cream
I made this before, the only part I struggled with was the damn whipped cream. Maybe cuz I live in a hot and humid country but my cream turns watery? I tried it 3 times and I end up screwing all 3 up, over whipped, underwhipped or not cold enough Urgh anyone have an alternative? Would Buttercream is too heavy ?
Ｗｉｆｅ？
Niki is a lesbian omfg
Nikki: my best friend Andrew  Nikki: oh wait no it’s Adam  Me: ROASTED BOI
Wait Niki lesbian?
rie is the most beautiful woman ever
like this video except for sjw Nikki
"I'm a big fan of crayps." lol
I love how half the people got excited knowing that Niki was gay, because damn straight even I was. I was like yaaaas, I found it really cute
Nikki is lesbian wtf...
Niki is gay
Cr-eh-p not craype

"I can call my wife" aw,I remember when she first mentioned her in the "The first time I kissed a girl" video❤
*tbh I’m only exited for eating your feed whenever it comes out because of rie*
*cream watch!*
Are you lesbian
Nikki always says “ No Lumps “ really long :P
Haven't Tasty make these before except they are 🌈
In Holland we put yam between the crepes and you actually should try to put it in the freezer before trying to cut is with a fork It also tastes better being chilled for a few min. (in my opinion) ;) but nice work damn well done
Rie asking for a pic 😂
Also she needs a crepe pan ( the thin ones) otherwise they won’t be as good
So nikki has a wife
My mum makes this all the time! She can’t make macarons well so she isn’t very skilled 😝
Question: can we make the assembly the previous day and pour the ganache the following day?
Girl has a girlfriend? What?
I love how there is a video credit to tasty in the tasty video lmao
YOU KNOW WHAT FORGET THE USUAL BIRTHDAY CAKE GET ME A CREPE CAKE! Hehehe
Okay right as real look like the chef from Ratatouille that finds out that the guy has a rat
Ries such a mom
the editing here is my fav
This is pretty cool and all, but I can't imagine it being all that great, considering it's mostly whipped cream and chocolate ganache
Love it when this say "we need rie"
10:07 Adam😂😂
most americans cant pronounce shit
She says ay instead of e in crepe! and its making my inner European soul hurt...
Its crepes with an E not a!!
0:55 When your best friend slaps you
I Want More Of This Gal! She Gives Off Positive Vibes!
10:15 Niki's face  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
She needs a different pan 😅 one that is flat.....
niki is lesbian
Rie is so elegant I love her
6:40
12:42 Andrew’s concentration face
So niki's lesbian? Hi niki im bisexual💕
She's a lesbian? (No hate)
I think ganache means fool in French

This has been going on in Sweden for like DECADES lool it’s called ‘pancakes tårta’. It’s normally eaten on birthdays (in the morning)
1 crépe at a time  2 crépes at a time?  3 crépes at a time?!  Woah this escalated quickly...
Rie is everywhere lol
Shady Anie
Crepe is pronounced cr Ehh p eh

I was confused about a crêpe but looked it up and it's just like a pancake well a British one anyways 😂

Give eating your feed their own channel!
More short pronounce please crêpe hide some alphabet so please say it in short sound.
WIFE?!🤔 niki’s WIFE?!
I tought the cake was a creepy version but it wasnt cuz it was a crepe
Why are they trying to make their own recipe on their own channel?
Rie the saviour 👏👏
niki is married?!
Rie is legit tasty mom
Niki and Adam are my favorite
Am I the only one who searched up who invented the tablespoons on butter bahahahhaha.
She is lesbian wtf?
Bruh why's she so stupid? Oh right she's lesbian and a feminist.
Haha😂😂
12:04 omg that high five is depressing
That's really cute that she is gay I love that
oof we eat this in hungary too
Ya gay nigga ?
Crapes?
Why don't you use pancake oven? :D  https://vasserpenyo.hu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/vas-palacsintasuto-de-buyer.jpg
It’s pronounced cre-pe
Yup rei is an AWSOME CHEF LITERALLY!
I keep hearing crate hahahah
0:26 when you credit your own video
You can tell people that watch this are really sensitive, because they censored the penis
Yass equality for straits and gays and lesbians and bisexual people
I’ve had expired milk, it had just became expired so I had a glass cup of milk thinking everything would be fine...      IT WAS NOT
What’s a crepe?!
Rie really reminds me of the girl in the ratatouille
is it crep like crep paper
When I make crepes I don’t flip them but they turn out fine
Does BuzzFeed is some kind of gay community?
We pronounce crepe as crep over in England and you say crépe  How do the French say it I’m confused
It's crEpe not crape
The batter is supposed to be thick
"crypes"
And you need a wider «flipping» thing lol
In Norway that is called pannekaker lol, that us pancakes just that here its just like that and tvinner so ITS normal haha
Why do ppl insist on using those tiny spatula things instead of a big spatula
Do more video
Everytime she says crêpes or ganashe I want stab myself in the ears with sharp pencils
Horn tooted
wait Niki has a wife?  Damnit im late. every cute one is taken
For some reason Rie reminds me of Mikasa from Attack on titan
"eating. eat. eating"  y did that remind me of mingyu 😂
She wasn’t bad at making crepes the cooker just cooks inconsistently lol
YAAAS *RIE* 🙌
She is bisexual?
12:04 nice try tho
12:58 Niki: There’s a penis! Andrew:... Excuse me?? 😂
*says crepe wrong whole video*
Wait Nikis lesbian I never knew that xx
What do they do with the rest of it
I could tell Niki was a lesbian by that shirt,, only lesbians do that outfit jekwhjdje
Rie is hella beautiful
I WANT TO MAKE CREPE CAKE SO BAD!!!😋🍰
So Niki is gay
Just made a crepe for breakfast this morning
Rie is so sweet I love her so much
On th 3rd time I hope u bought new milk
We want more of rie
Cream watch 2018😂😂😂10:44
12:57 Rie seems so proud of what Niki has accomplished on the side of the cake
*look at my friends hI FrIEnDs*  *Friends peep* Me:*I have no friends* Btw 10:30
Rie...the tasty hero of all time 😊😊 she's so nice..
"Ouchy mama" 😂
She ended up using Rie's recipes lmao
Rie is tasty queen/master
Why do I torture myself with this 🤧
it is very watery
ouchie mama 😂
Niki calling her wife gave me life
Crepes has an E, not an A.
Pretty sure someone already said this but ganache basically means donkey in French and it's what it is because someone in a bakery unintentionally put hot milk over chocolate and the chef cursed and told him he was a donkey/stupid but then he liked it and just named it ganache   (pls correct me if I'm wrong)
IT'S CREPES NOT CRAPES
What happen to your pinkie?
Maybe it was the milk
12:57 "there's a p****"
when i use my fingers to flip a crepe, I dip my fingers in ice cold water
What’s a crape I thought it was pronounced as crep
it's because the Tasty electric stove is shit. She can probably make her recipe pretty well at home, where she doesn't have to use the brand's stove
I guess you could call this... a princess and the penis cake...
Cräip😂
6:50 “I’ve just been doing everything wrong my whole life” ~Niki May 19 2018   I love Niki 😂
Rie is like the mom of Tasty she helps everyone when they're in need
Life hack to not burn your finger while flipping a crepe is get a clean pair of hot glue gun finger thimble things and use those when flipping, they work everytime for me!!
Niki or Andrew.
This is eating *YOUR FEET*
It's pronounced crepay not crapes
Owww this is diff ic ult
we call those pancakes :-)
10:08 you couldn’t have just made more?
Adam always gets so much shit lol
.......’cRaPe’ ???????
I feel like Niki's vocabulary is just "ow" 😂 don't get me wrong, i love her 🤣
U like crepes so much that u say crape... jk i know its just an accent 😂
ITS NOT CALLED “craip” Its called “Crepe” LIKE IM SORRY YALL AMERICANS HAVE TROUBLE PRONOUNCING SOME WORDS BUT SRSLY
That's not how you make crêpes ! Where is the beer ? First you mix all the powders, then you add the milk+beer+butter slowly dissolving the dough... And this cake is an hungarian recipe.
how did u break ur pinkie XD
Too much cocoa. And the milk is fine for a few more days.
Are crapes the american version of europian pancakes?
who else says Crepes different  then Niki?  also im really hungry now!
Isn’t it pronounced crep not craype
Is niki a gay?????
You should beat your eggs in a different bowl before adding it to your mixing bowl
I made this recipe it was nasty
why did they blur the penis shaped crepe?
CREEP CRAPE CRAYPE CRAP CREPE CRÈPPE CREPÉ CREPPE CRYPE CRIPE
seems like the batter was too thin at first we do crepes daily around here
💕🌸🌼💕🌸🌼💕🌸🌸🌼💕🌼💕🌸🌸🌼💕💕🌸🌼🌼💕🌸🌸🌼💕💕🌸🌼🌼
I felt really bad at 12:04.
Isn’t she from buzzfeed
Why you making things you already made??
This is basically a chocolate English pancake 🥞 lol xx
best crepe recipe: 4 eggs, 400-500 ml of milk, cuppa powder, a tea spoon of salt and a table spoon of sunflower oil... nothing can beat that <3 sincerely, the biggest crepe lover of all times
Ha look at Andrews hair at 12:35
I made crepes for the first time yesterday, and I had a great time making them. They aren't that hard.
I don't think I really like Niki. Sorry
Beautiful
She is a lesbian
wait it niki lesbian :o
“I wonder if my batter is too thick” GIRL WTF IT SHOULD BE THICKER THAN THIS
Now I wanna make crepes again
Andrew is so cute lol
Americans say ganache weird
Ganache means mistake in french
12:09 blurred
i dont think that induction cook top cooks evenly...

2:09 I have the same whisk
Oh god she's lesbo i can't believe it 💋💋💋💋💋💖💖💖😭💔💔
*I like creeps*
You are supposed to pronounce crêpes to rhyme with steps
I always preferred steven, but andrew looking like a snacc nowadays🤤😏
Finally😭😭 someone who says crepe right XD 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
you know whats easier than this?? literally everything try using a blender and dont use a pan so fuckin DEEP
Why are all her videos with the same expression on her face.  So overrated tasty.
Where are their cooktops from?! 😭
Crepes is satisfying when you cut into it, feeling the layers
Niki and her wife should start a YouTube channel
I’m 10 and I can make crepes
This is cringe
I didn’t know niki was lesbian
This made me hungry  :3 (I want some:3)
Du cacao dans la pâte à crêpes?! Sacrilège ! 😱
0:55  When you find out your parents bought cookies.
Rie is like TASTY's sensai
We call those... crepes..? Pancakes. They’re just like our pancakes... weirddd
What is a CRAPE
Next time maybe try using a lower pan, slide the crepe onto the pan cover and flip it back into the pan!
I've never had crepe
Comment "aye" if you think that ganache is thicker than you ;)
why I'm watching this at 12:00 am...
this lesbian is so annoying
Y     E     I     G    E    T      N         Your feed
*THICK SHISTER*
Hope it good
Pause at 10:50 😂
Proud of her lol, crepes take work👏👏
I think Andrew was talking about Barbie A Fashion Fairytale 😂 idk how I know that
the utc has to make62 crepe
Her name is" Rie " !!!!that literaly means" laugh "in spanish 😂😂😂😂😂
Nikki is sooo funny! 😂
The way she said crepes triggered me
*You were there?*  That's what all my friends say to me
The cringe of her saying crepe
R.I.P pinky
WHEN SHE CALLED HER WIFE MY HEART MELTED😭❤️
Wait she’s lesbian
10:38 Ganache comes from France: A bakers boy mixed hot cream with chocolate by accident and his boss called him „Ganache“ which means donkey or fool. Then he found out that it was a super chocolate-saucey-creamy thing and he called it Ganache.
I love how she keeps saying “Andrew” instead of “Andy”
Aren't crapes pancakes...? What's the difference?
At 5:54 what was that
Okkkk shes uh gay....
*no lumpss*
It was cooking in the centre more because u poured the batter in the centre so the middle had more time to cook
is rie from China?
if she says “craype” one more time i stg
Everyone loves Rie, it’s just a fact😂
it annoyed me so much when you were using your fingers to flip the crepes rather than the spatula arGsh
Andrew and Adam are both awesome
Shrek cooks cake
"egg juice"
Biggest fail was at 8:02 lol
Also use a completely flat pan without large edges.
How much is 13/ 4 cups
ganazche is the icing sauce
wife wtf
shes annoying compared to the others
what are crapes? lol
Imagine all the dirty dishes at the end.
I use a silicone/rubber spatula to flip the crepes and it works amazing! I can easily flip it. I didn’t even know you could have problems in flipping a crepe (I’m 12 for those of you wondering). So if you have problem flipping, try using a silicon:rubber spatula
I like the way that that the milk is out of date but Adam still drinks it. Why
When in trouble call Rie 😂
You know, I was about to send this video to my mom, so maybe we could make it (I'm sure she wouldn't really mind the a word or anything ) but when it was at 8:01 lol... I decided not to
Get niki out of this show. Get niki out of all the shows actually.
Ok na sana kaso sobrang arte nitong gurl.
This is similar to what we have in croatia but ours are called palačinke.
Soooo...     Crêpes is the same thing as pancakes, but fancyer.....    _right..?_
DIS FOOED LUKS DIGUSING AND TERBLE YOO AR SILIE YOO POO POO
anyone else notice the cake being blurred out at 12:09
Wait  she is a girl right im confuse
U should of used gas or electric not that tasty crap plug in stove because it doesn’t heat evenly and only the center try boiling water and u will see what I’m on about , I bet your awesome at making crepes
U always make it look better and u made it not look like is frickin burnt
(I am French) it is cr-E-pe not crape
It took me 3 hours to make it... And I have 0 experience in cooking... I had all the ingredients in home so I watched a walkthrough and made it much faster... Did I mention that I have 0 cooking experience? I didn't even know how to make crapes before today
She is lesbian I had no idea Im not hating I’m fine with it just I watched every vid except for this one
Crepes are alot like English pancakes
Niki is lasbiab right?
anybody else hate rie
What I don’t get is why the people who made the original dessert, help the recreaters.
I failed :(((  I couldnt flip it ‘cause too hot :(( n i couldnt touch it :(((  Please help me :((  I really wanna make that for my family
You normally don't want to whisk your ganache to fast because that encorporates air bubbles into the ganache.
the princess and the penis under the crepe cake
Egg juice
“ okay so this is eating your feed my name is nicki and my best friend is Andrew and today he is challenging me to make...” I love these intros!
I made a chocolate hazelnut cake for my sister's bday once. I made a hazelnut ganache and a chocolate sauce and candied hazelnuts to put on top and it took forever but it came out great
Pronounced crepp
12:04  What kind of clap is that
She's sooooo ugly on the thumbnail
that looks so good🤤
Niki is literally the best person in the world.
*RIE WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE*
my brother and i tried this and the frosting ending up being a puddle around the soggy chocolate cake
Adam is my hero
When u said pizza I felt like eating pizza I'm serious when u said pizza batter I wanted to eat pizza with da breadsticks does anyone else felt a crave for pizza or is it just me?🤔
Here in europe (were crepes originated from) we flip it with the pan
Niki lesbian?
12:09 why is it blured  Edit: 13:02 uhhhh
This is the first time I knew that Nikki is gay :P Not that I hate or am disgusted or anything. I LOVE U NIKKI
why is the front of the crepe cake blurred out ?
Not hating-just noticed Niki’s face at 5:57 - also I LOVE THIS SERIES AND NIKI AND ANDREW AND ADAM AND RIE SM
More eating your feeds video please!

Woaw. Se is lesbian?
beautiful cake
Nick's a lesbiam

12:08 wait did she stuck the crepe penis on the side of the cake because of the blurring?       Confirmed 12:57 lol 😂
She is gay 😭😭😭 boohoo 😕😕😕
7:42 Yes, much _batter_
3:44 Don't you mean    *"s-crepe, s-crepe, s-crepe."* ?
isnt that ugly chick that girl from the feminist videos
2:19 egg juice lol
It was a d*** LMAOOOO
Omg I've tried making crepes and they were burnt and someone taught it was chocolate😂
why do people hate bubbles on pancakes (crepes for you heathens) the bubbles add a small crunch that is so good
that's not the exact pronunciation of crepes ;)
I have two words right now...     I’m hungry.
I made a crepe cake and I really recommend to let it chill for a day in the fridge
rip Nikki  Rie doesn’t remember Nikki eating crepes with her XD
Why does she talk about it like she knows what she's doing and then is actually terrible at it? Just admit you can't cook...
don't say oh my God
Yum why did I watch this I want to eat it now
Shes lesbian what
“Craep” ....
Niki’s Wife?
Wait i cannot understand wait so she has a wife or husbans i do not get it
I like watching Niki do things
Lol you’re a big fan of creeps😂😂
Ur meant to pronounce it "crep" not "craep"
*12:09** Why Is It Blurred?*
Adam shld cook
Rie, please adopt me.
i want crepes now
Milk is usually good like two days to a week after the exp date apparently
The thumbnail pisses me off for some reason
Can you all try to make the stretchy ice cream
I'm so sorry but I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole video because her pronunciation of crêpe made me cringe so hard
5:59 Kelsie- Niki's wife, crepe enthusiast I wish both of those were my job tbh
Okay so @5:17 the problem that she was having by just looking was that the batter is to soupy it needs to be a little thicker and in my experience with doing a breakfast crêpe bar and doing a crêpe cake before it will help to learn to flip one with out need of utensils and if you use a smaller pan like an egg pan that is nonstick This is just from my knowledge of culinary experience and from what I can see 👌🏽
You can't be good at be good at making crépes if you say it wrong
I heard your milk can last a week after the expiration date? That's what my mom has told me
Feels good...MAN!
To make sure that the pan is hot enough you should put just like a splash of water on the pan, and if it starts to sizzle and moves around like really fast then you're good.
0:54 *TRIGGERED*
Your gay ok no problem not bashing
Niki always looks uncomfortable and it makes me uncomfortable
Niki's wife??????
Niki  is a gay
I love me some egg juice
I AM A COW
One day past with milk is nothing. I just ate a bowl of cereal with a week old gallon of milk and it was fine
they are crepes not crapes u say it like creps
Rie is like Nikkis cool mom!
THICC

Wait Niki has a wife?🤯
YAY I GOT 1 LIKE YUSSSSS         oh wait, that was me... ;-;
Is it just me or is niki lesbian!!??🙀🙀
Niki and her wife are so cute
i wanna watch but i keep getting buzzfeed flash backs from her
What kind of chocolate did u pour at ze end
12:09 What are they pixelating on the left side of the cake?!
Why do you even flip it? It is extremely thin already no chance that there is anything raw left
Why is nobody talking about the crepe shaped like a man’s things??? I fell off my bed laughing 😂
Niki is gay what!!!!
I think you made the batter too thin
funny "TASTY" video ever
That camera man though.. 🙃💓😍
Niki
can rie just adopt me
i got 6 ads for powdered baby milk. does that show how family friendly this is? 😂
Rie's laugh at the end is so beautiful
It's nor craps it's crep
Every time she crepes I nearly died  because I pronounce it different
12:09 anyone else notice the pixels on the cake? lol i wonder why
i just thought.... why isnt adam making anything. see how easy it is for him
At 8:51. You be like Soma Yukihira on Food Wars, 3 pans at a time,  Like a boss.😎
Yay Niki!!
Whoops accidentally added the question mark
Love the vids? I may be young but I love to watch people cook
12:04 oof
Can you try to do swedish pancakes?? They are as thin as crepes and you top them of with all kinds of berries and whipped creme
That "egg juice" is called egg. /s
I am a simple kid who sees such videos ....but never tries to make them.
Well congratulations 🎊 on your marriage ⚭. 👰 👰
These cake making videos look soooooo easy but never turns out the same way when I try. 😰sobs
This lady is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
3:34 scared the life of me and thought someone was whispering near my ear cause i was using headphone and was hearing the vid while playing a game. GG
No offense but nikis lesbian
Nikki's cake looks better than the original
Plz tell me people don’t find these guys funny, I just watch for the food
Lol  they were using a tasty branded whisk (the rainbow one) so they made fun of there companies own merchandise
my school told us it's called crepes
You should try sugar cookies and then decorate so it looks like different foods that you eat on a daily basis
I didn’t know you were lesbian
"Andrew's clapping, Andrew never claps for me" lmao
Why would you even censor penis
Nikki's wife???? She's a girl right?? Someone please clear my doubts...
I didnt know niki is gay ._.
She kept the penis lmao 🤣
From a French, her crepe recipe is weird
5:55 LGBT pride moment
Every hungry person watching tasty just wants to eat all the food on screen
12:08 censored on left??
Niki's Wife?? Or Husband? What?
Niki was me at 0:57
CHALLENGE: Take a shot for everytime she says "Crepe(s)"
Kind of useless when you do the same experiment without changing anything.
I never see stupid woman
Shes gay i didn't know
is anyone else french here and currently hitting their head on whatever device you're watching this on because of the way americans say "crêpe"?
5:59 OMG I’m so late but didn’t know Niki was  family #Lesbians #LGBT
You can say the batter is better 😏
Wife??

I love that I get recommendations for videos with you. I love them!
This is to hot to grab! *grabs it anyway* HHHHH..... 😂😂😂😂🤣
Nikki's wife? Never expected that
There's A story about ganache . From france
Actually , ganache means idiot or stupid
I like how she needs to appreciate the moment she cuts it
I hope that i can taste your food its loooksss soooo ggoooddd😍
Niki sounds like a Pokémon :D :D
Wait niki is lesbian😲
Niki has a wife????!!!
I wonder if Adam is everybody's best friend now 😂😂😂😂 (that'd be cool tho)  Hey Adam can I be your friend too?  Me: This TOTALLY isn't so that I can get hired to work at Tasty... not at all.. *innocent smile
Wait What?? Niki has a Wife?!! Ohhh myy
hearing her say "my wife" made me smile so big aahhhh hearing women say that is Therapeutic™
If you have to strain the crepe batter then you did something wrong
Nikki ur awesome at cooking, and making me laugh while u cook. Keep up the good work
I need a crepe cake I've never tried one also I NEED A CHEF BECAUSE WHEN EVER I COOK IT GOES WRONG lol
She gay
I make like 300 crepes a day(my parents own a crêperie)
niki I’m a kid and when cooking crepes you must not use fresh milk and cook it slowly
why did you blur the cake at 12:08? 😂
I thought Niki was straight
Look at rie expression! So cute 12:56
The batter looks way too thin
Onomonopias reminiscent of Its Alive with Brad
Rie is heart 💓
The pan your using is wrong use cast iron
I feel like a Mexican mom can do this.
Lesbian?
Niki has a wife?
wait wait wait is she lesbian or was she joking bcs she said she gonna call het wife
andrew's still in buzzfeed????
niki is lesbian?
Why does it show people cooking or making stuff but when I went to their channel it's just food I still subscribed someone please tell me
Can I just have a playlist of all videos Rie appears in Absolutely love her
Rie reminds me of Collete from Ratatouille and Edna from The Incredibles
Good job:)
honestly if you know how to make crepe's then doing the rest pf crepe cake shouldn't be so impossible...right?
your problem is the awful tasty cooktop
4:53 when yeor so done with life
I didn't know Nikki was lesbian  I am okay with it  And i respect it
Nice 👍 😊
ganache is a french word  meaning a whipped filling of chocolate and cream used in deserts
I LOVE RIE!!!! She's sooooo cute!!
tie looks like the girl chef from ratatouille
1 crepe is like 200 calories so like 10  is a death sentence
can you do a video where we just get to know adam
Im so hungry😭
Why was 12:08 blurred out?
✌"EGG JUICE"✌
Me when I cook
cool but i can do better
Im making this
Learn to pronounce Crepe 😥
YAAAASSSS NIKIIII
I like how honest this is. Like how she gets it wrong so many times before she gets it done perfectly.
the way you say crepe makes me cringe lol
She so ugly
Amazing!!!
the indignant shrieking of “I’VE MADE CREPES BEFORE”
I do have a wife too.. But she can't cook at all.. But it's okay, she love my food when i cook for us..
Niki's wife?
Wait shes gay 😱
*Her Difficulty Making Crepes Is My Difficulty 'Making' Cup-Of-Noodles ._.*
you can make them but yet you cant pronounce them
Actually , the date that is written on package of a product , is when this product has to be taken from the stores shelf ... So the product is still ok to eat or use for like a week after that date !! Just saying 😉
Why I am watching these... I am on a diet
Rie’s smile is so bright and beautiful ☺️
Why does no one know you can go at least 5 days after the expiration date before actually worrying about it being expired
It sounds like she’s saying she loves creeps 😂
Soooo shes a lesbian?
im a big fan of craps
Your crepe cake was better than the one on the video you watched👍❤️😆
when i heard Niki said she has a wife, i was like whhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
You have a wife?......
I made my mom the Rose creep cake with strawberry and she liked it enough.  For my birthday she made me a boxed cake.
I make it like an hour or 2
“I’M NOT A CHILD, I DRINK MILK!!!!”
I hate how Americans pronounce crepes 🤦🏻‍♂️
Rie is so adorable every video and I want her to teach me cooking.
Everyone needs a Rie in their life.
it should be called zebra cake
06:59 haff kop of milk atta tam
Am I the only one that’s really annoyed how she says “crape”? I pronounce it “crep” not “crape”. I hope I’m not the only one because this reallyyyyyyyy annoyed me😂😂 maybe it’s just how Americans pronounce it? I’m British and we say it “crep”
Hi
Wait is Nicki a lesbian
When she the "who thought of the tablespoon for the butter" I thought of who thought of the skip intro button for Netflix THEY BETTER BE RICH
That awkward moment when she says i can call my wife
is niki lesbian
What do you mean by Nikki's wife
This reminded me of a scene from shokugeki no souma when souma was making souffle omelets
Niki : my best friend is Andrew, no he's not.. It's Adam.. -lol-   Andrew: :(
I promise you that im not trying to show off but I made this and it was EASY! It did take a while though
Niki is lesbian??
0:55 straight from a horror movie
Nikki is my soul animal
why does the guy hold the fork like that... lmao dude holding it like its a mic
She’s lesbian?!
I just wanna say that the reason why butter produced in the US has volume markings on them is because we don't use the metric system.
As a french, she made me lost any hope I had in America 😒
crapes?😂
My mom makes chocolate crepes ALL the time, and i sometimes help her out with flipping them and watching over them while they're on the pan, and it seriously is NOT that hard, I just gotta day she's terrible
I love ries accent 😀
i love Rie.
Would she just wait for the crepes to cook
niki is so ugly and annoying
There's a pea-nis on the cake
Y didnt she use the original buzfeed video for the recipe
Wait what Niki's wife😕
Why do Americans say crape for crepe?! Its pronounced crep.
Haha Adam is in the friend zone
It's crepes not crape
Okay Fella's sing with me  If there's something wrong in your kitchen  Who you gonna call?!  Rie!  LOL
I'm glad I'm not the only one who uses 'thing' as an increment of measure.
Rie IS SEXYYYYYYY😍😍😍😍😍😍
If she vlogged she would make so much more money than working for a huge company. Very cool personality
KELSIE is lesbian 🏳️‍🌈 😮
I wonder how many times she says crepes
It didn’t work because it was to thin
Rie is so funny
Is it just me or do the crepes look like pancakes?!🤤
I’m a big fan of CrApEs
the first part was painful to watch the batter  recipe fialed  you
Your so good at them you don't know how to pronounce it properly
I swear everyone on this channel is gay
I kinda had a crush on Niki before ,but not now
Andrew said the most random comment yet made the most sense. Replace the layers of cream with marshmallow.
this was so annoying to watch where is andrew
Wait is nikki bi?
I’ve always thought that u have to put the same amount of sugar as coco powder or else it’ll taste bitter
You keep saying "Eating your feet"
Congratulations on getting to making three at a time!   But when you can master it try doing eight at a time! Us Chef's don't have time to waste, nor do we use those little tabletop cookers.   Eight burner stoves, with eight different sized pans, all cooking Crepes at the same time, for three hours non-stop, a lot of batter and a lot of crepes, at least twice a week for 9 years. I think I've mastered the technique!  Oh! and Rie is Cute! I'd like to take her in a kitchen and cook some of the ideas in these videos!
Is it just me or does she need attention on her 24/7
u should make a giant crepe cake or at least try to
Why is that censored at 12:08?
I like how they censored the crepe dick
Are you Nicki Minaj
Crepe recipe:  1/2 cup cold water 1/2 cup milk (regular milk is best) 2 cups flour (approx) pinch salt **********OPTIONAL************** two eggs 1 tablespoon butter  DIRECTIONS  PUT EVERYTHING IN A BLENDER and liquefy very briefly (45 secs)  Consistency of this thing should be a slightly more watery pancake batter.  If it's too watery, add more flour.  Definitely don't make it chunky.   Put the thing in the refrigerator at least an hour until all the bubbles disappear.  At this time, the batter will be a little thicker because it is cold and the flour will expand.  You can leave this in the refrigerator overnight so you can handle it better.   COOK Use a big ass pan with a flat bottom.  Heat to medium high to start and when ready to cook, go to medium. Spray with oil (PAM). Use a ladle to scoop this in the center and then pick up the pan to spread the crepe around as much of the pan as possible.  When the edges dry and fold up slightly, it's ready to flip it.  You flip ONCE.  Respray the pan with PAM every time you make another one.    This works EVERYTIME.  This will make about 7 to 8 crepes.  The mixing will take less than 10 minutes and the refrigerator is only an hour long.   You should be able to make and serve this within 3 hours or less.   Good luck.
8:00 lmao
Wait shes gay?? Oh i didnt know Well be happeh!
11:56 lol
Why us part if the cake blurred
It took me 5-6 hours
Are you taken or single. Everyone probably wants to be taken😂
Why not use heat resistant gloves
I love Niki
Wait, HOW do you pronounce crepe? You say it like crêpe, right? Like in the french way right
She doesn't even know how to use a whisk...
Didn’t know she had a wife😔 I’ve been shipping her with Andrew 😂
LOL Andrew's face after seeing the crepe penis XDDDDDD
Crepes are so easy to make ._.
Honestly though, what would we have done without Rie.
I've made crepes before, but never thought of making them into a cake. I will have to try that next time. It looks good!
Rea is like my mother 😂😂😂
Was "Cream Watch 2018" a MBMBAM reference?
pls hire me after i graduate college
please hire me after i graduate college in 2 yeats
pls hire me after i graduate
0:12 that voice tho
She mispronounced "crêpe" .Every. Single. Time.
This is my fav vid of eating your feed theres something satisfying about the video and i really like nikki
Your crepe com's from the French word crêpe and crêpe means pancakes. Your pancakes are called American pancakes in Belgium and France
The way she says crepe is so painful and cringy
13:00 cursing
Love this channel😂❤️
I hate crepes but I love watching
I like Rie. She dope
Niki Is Gay Have a GF
That looks so good... But my OCD killed me when they didn't put it in the fridge first to harden the ganache
My name is spelled the same way
Let the rainbows shine🌈
I don't care if she is gay!! Y do people care about that stuff
The definition of ganache I whipped filling of chocolate and cream that is the definition of ganache I hope I helped you
This is an example of me when I try to cook
What are crepe cakes? They look delicious!
lol nika is a lessbain
I think Andrew is talking about when London Tipton from Suite life of Zach of Cody wouldn’t sleep because her bed wasn’t comfortable and Mr. Mosby had to figure out why and he found a diamond or whatever under her mattress that kept her from sleeping. Idk.
I think it would be really cool to do different colors of cream or crêpe batter so when you cut in to it it would be like a rainbow
lol how could you ruin crepes
Nikis lesbien?
It was definitely the cocoa powder
NIKI IS A LEZBIAN WTF
I swear the girl with the shortest hair (who tasted the cake at the end ) said she was lactose intolerant yet she’s always eating the cream and cheese and stuff
It's cr-epee not cr-eaps
it's not preety much your fault it's that cocoa powder can complicate things
She has wife? Weird or lesbian?
10:31 <3
I’ve broken both my pinkys and I felt her say that
chocolate pepe cake kek
This chick in the red shirt has the most annoying voice and worst personality of any of the people on this channel, please stop putting her in front of the camera.
I NEVER KNEW SHE WAS GAY(or at least bi or pan)
What shes gay
Just as good as on the Great British Bake Off!!
At part 1 I actually thought she farted 😂
stop saying crapes
Probably cause the tasty one top is the shittiest thing on earth
I was laughing for this whole time *bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop* best thing I’ve seen all day
the hot plate u used was crap       even though y’all made made it
Nickki should join Rosanna Pansino on nerdy Nummies
I love theses videos
It's called crép, not crepe. It's said crap but e
12:58 tag urself I'm Rie
WAIT she's lesbian I didn't know or was she kidding
At 11:39 my mom was on the phone and went OHHHHHHHH 😂
It’s crepe not crape
You can just tell that they fucking hate eachother
Ganache or crème ganache was originally a kind of chocolate truffle introduced by the Paris confectioner Maison Siraudin in about 1862 and first documented in 1869.[3] It was named[by whom?] after a popular vaudeville comedy by Victorien Sardou, Les Ganaches ("The Chumps")[4][5] (1862). -Wikipedia (citing the OED)
NIKKI HAS A WIFE?! OMG. SUPPORRT! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Do we have to put a bit of oil on the fry pan??
THIS GIRL IS LESBO
Awwwwwww she has a wife?! That's so cute!!!
I like my recipe better, buy flour tortillas, melt choc chips add to beat cream or sour cream. Layer, to top. Top os either whipped cream or sour cream with a little powdered sugar.
It was so cringe when she sniffed the milk like that (cuz I’m ocd about things over my food😂) but I loved the vid ❤️❤️
i love this video so much
Creake
Have I been pronouncing crepe wrong lmao
Friend: watching these videos makes me hungry!  Me: Relatable....:O
12:47  Is he referring to a Barbie movie? I can’t remember the name though
🤤
Shouldve placed it in the fridge before cutting
I love how in every single one of these Rie awkwardly comes out of the corner         This gives me life
00:47 - 00:56 MY ENTIRE LIFE SUMMED UP IN 9 SECONDS.
Me, 5:36 It's not the right pan! Change the pan!  Me, 5:47 They change the pan!
wait, why does it say niki's wife?
I feel bad for the people who have  to wash the dishes
that is just swedish pancakes -.-'
the reason y her crepe failed this time as a pose to the other times she made it was because of the fucking tasty brand stove
12:09 why is the left side of the cake blurred?
Not related but why does she look like Yoongi somehow
At 2:18 ..... Rest In Peace Pinky 😂🤞🏽
is niki lesbians?
INSIDER+TASTY+bon apetit=buzzfeed
After this I have more appreciation for the pastry chef who will make this for me in the future 😂😂😂
CRAP PRONUNCIATION
*#WATCHCREEM2018*
@12:04 when they did a high five it looked like they missed and added a fake hand slap 🍮🤣
Is there ANYONE else who gets super annoyed when she says ‘crApes’  Who pronounces it ‘crepes’ with no exaggerated vowels?!?
2:18 I have a broken pinkie and I can’t get egg juice on it . Lol
wait yall had trouble with this ? o-o
Nikki is lesbian
This has been my experience. I gave up.
12:09 wtf is blurred out
I didnt know NIKI was gay!!!
luv this channel!
Why is it blurred at 12:09?  (Edited) nvm
When you see how long it is you know how long it’s gonna take
6:44 she sounds like miranda sings at that time 😂
3:40 "I swear this never happens!"
BLOOP
*oWcHiE mAmA*
10:30 *when you don't know someone's name*
Who else cringed when she kept on saying crepe wrong  ( *CrAiP* )
Rie's shrugged is so cutee
how to fall in love , step one : watch niki cooking
omg nikki is wearing the Boys Please Dress Like This shirt
rie is sooooo mysterious!!!!
they forgot to put in the clapping ha ha
Oh mah god she’s gay! This is amazing!
I’m British she said it like c-r-A-p-E but I say it like c-r-E-p-E
Don’t try this!! It tastes like really bad milo!! It’s basically diabetes in a bite!! All I’m trying to say is it’s a waste and don’t bother making it.
...you can drink milk up to 5 days passed expiration.... do people pour out perfectly good milk....
The people who disliked this video are on a diet 😂😂😂😂😂
It’s 4:30am and now I’m hungry, thanks.
She sounds like Mabel from gravity falls , who else thinks so
Is Niki lesbian
Lesbian
Thats what you get when you eat your only good damn crepe woman!
It's not a crepe..just a fucking pancake lmao
wait niki is lebian???  i never knew that!! i still support them though
Being British every time she says "crape" I die a little inside
Crepes aren't meant to be flipped and should be crispy on the outside and soft in the middle
Video credit: THEMSELVES
8:02 lol
Wife? Ugh
you should try crepe that takes 8 hours to do it, how real food is made, not as selling, but what she love
Ummmmm she is super cute. Rie is amazing. Best show ever made hehehhee what was created???? Heheheheh
Ewww lesbain ..... wife ?
When making a Crepe cake you MUST make all the noises Niki is making for your cake to be successful lol
I hope someone reads this. I do love stuffed burger's.  I make them all with all types of cheeses. With bacon on top. 425 apx 20 mins Yummy. I'm making now provolone cheese stuffed pepper bacon on top. Yummy!
“Wait where’s the penis?!” “Excuse me!¿”  🤣🤣🤣
Adam should try making something
She's lesbian!!!! 😱
Use an actual stove.
It's literally 12:38 am
Rie looks like enda from the Incredibles but with black hair like if you agree💀😴
this looks so amazing :)
There's a special pan for making crepes
Naleśniki
This is cringy. If this is how all Americans make crepes then im gonn comit suicide. You dont flip them with your hands. You flip them with the pan so it flips in the air.
to T H I C C C C C
"I can call my wife"     My life was just ahhhhhh😭💙
"Wow, it looks like a big smore." - Andrew 2018
5:57    Wait They are girls and it says nikies wife?! KELSIE SHES A GIR-Wait I just thought of the word "gay" KEEP ON GOING WITH UR LIFE THEN
5:20 background music sounds like the sims 4
"Eating your feet".
If you pause at 10:30, it's funny to see Andrew and Annie's faces peeping in the door. Annie looks concerned as all hell. Andrew looks like he wasn't told that they were doing this so he's hiding his sadness from Niki, Adam and Rie.
I tried this once with peanut butter whipped cream... I struggled making chocolate crepes so much.....
What do crêpes taste like?
The way she says crépe makes me cringeeeee 😂😂😂
Niki is gay?
Niki lesbi? Or she is a boy
Being a former dishwasher for a gourmet restaurant everytime they use a different utensil or plate for the same thing i cringe soo hard
Does Niki have her own channel? I just adore her...
11:50 there's a dick at the bottom right
Isn't Adam from vat 19
At 12:02 that clap is so fake I want cry
10:30 Andrew reference?
Rie at 12.58 in the video is killing me. 😂😂😂😂😂
4:47 😂😂
Are crapes like thin pancakes
Nikki has a wife? She looks so young to be married  *TRUE LOVEEEE*
of course the lesbian would make a penis shaped crepe.
*6:57** What does that taste like tho*
*triggered* crêpe not crApe
Am I the only one who wished she let the chocolate harden up before she cut it
As far as she got was already farther then I could of! 👩🏻‍🍳❌
12:58 RIE’S REACTION HAHAHAHAHAAH FUFUFUDUFUDDU
I really wanna try making a crepe cake now
This looks amazing
Batter is too thin! Way too thin. (The first one, I mean...)
Niki is the best entertainment at tastyyyyyy
Nikis wife is gonna watch this video and be like: OHHHHHH
You are suppose to swirl the batter in the pan not the pan in the air don’t take the pan off the heat
i love how adam just eats/drinks anything you give him and he’s content. a mood
ur batter is too thin.
She has a wife ?!
Savage Rie😂
*T H I C C* layer
Ganache means something similar  to donkey
Crape
Rie is so precious, she's great.
Niki: bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop me: lethal overdose of combined cuteness and lmao
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
_egg juice_
Rie is the best chef!
“I’m out of cream” - has at least a cup left in the bowl-
In Tasty, we're all Rie's child.
Niki is lesbian
My crepe ingredients: flour, milk, egg
Omg i didnt know she had a wife. Thats so cute.
Niki is really cool, I love her
Maybe use a smaller pan
😮 I learnt how to make crapes when I was 10 years old, it's really not that difficult...
Ganash means idiot! Because when they where doing chocolate things at the kitchen, like.... in 1600/1630.... one of the young cookers dropped milk, accidentally into the chocolate, while it was cooking... The chef just said "Ganash!". The poor young cooker started mixing that like he "knew" what he was doing and then, afterwards...... here he have one of the most popular foods/ culinary techniques!
This seems really easy, but I mess everything up, so there’s no hope😃
It might be a better crepe and also easier to cook if they use a crepe pan
5:49   Probably the most adorable thing I've ever seen.
12:08 why was a part of the cake pixilated?😂😂
fairy godrie
nikki pinky is always broken
I'm British and this video is REALLY ANNOYING: in England, a 'crepe' is a regular pancake. An American 'pancake' is a scotch pancake. A HUGE, french pancake is a Crepe, pronounced 'crep' . 🤦🏻‍♂️
Who else loves Rie ? Like she’s my favorite of them all 😁
Asian represent!!!!!!
Im hungry....
Make me cake please
Why is tie my favorite?
I’ll have 4
Basically the traditional English pancake
5:58 isn't she tomboy???? Girl that have wife😱😱😱😱
Honey your so extra ps irrtating aguhh
I love how Rie is like their Supervisor/Mother/Guide/Teacher/Adviser/etc...
NOICE
00:10  was kinda mean...still like her but kinda mean
🤣 that lil crepe cake piece on the side of the crepe cake.
I didnt know that Niki was lesbian and has a wife......  Edit: BTW im new here so....
Crepe: Flour 1 3/4 cup Cocoa powder 1/4 cup Sugar 7 tbs Egg 6 whole Milk 3 cups Melted butter 6 tbs  Whipped Cream: Cream 4  Ganache (?): 1 big chocolate bar 2 cream 4 tbs sugar
I think Ganash means dressing
🍪_🍪 YUM
12:05 lmao what? their didn’t even touch
13:48 thank me later
I didn't know she was bi
Wife?
"Crapes"
Adam is best friend.
Idk Nikki was gay... not to be rude. I know ppl that r
Why is there blurring at 12:08?
I’m 11 and you’re inspiring me to give up my geology dream and go to professional cooking.👏👏👏👏
Why so many ingredients my recipe has only 3 .           I am talking about the crepes only.
Well you don't spill the stuff like that. My mom used a spoon to spill it in the middle and gently makes circles to spread it out
Ouchy mama     😂😂
Crepes are so fun and easy to make and I’m only 13 and made a perfect crepe my 1st try lmao
I feel like Rie is just everybody's mom haha
its really... tasty
My mouth watered the whole time
RIE TO THE RESCUE !!!
Please pronounce crêpe not creeep
First tasty video that annoyed the hell out of me. First the thing with how the crepe batter was made and then the baking of them it was like a catastrophe was ment to happen...
I'm hungry now
Is it "kr-e-p" Or "kr-ay-p"
how does niki have a wife??
Very amazing recipe. So tasty
Those aren’t crepes those are British pancakes
12:32 What is this? Don't look at those Im laughing so hard rn
Wait is Niki a lesbian?
I never actually knew that crepes were called crepes. My family is Swedish descent, so we have always called them Swedish Pancakes
Look at all these people Adam dared to cook random trendy foods.  The best part is if they succeed, and they do alot, he gets free food.  Goddammit, Adam. 😂
that is actually just an extremely shitty stove that only heats in a ring in the centre of the pan and also doesnt really get hot enough.
The satisfaction is *UNREAL❗❗❗*
Niki is like a anime girl and ı am confused kelsıe is nikis WİFE dude ı am so confused rigth now hmm someone explain
I love how they have a lot of lgbt 🏳️‍🌈 people working at buzzfeed!
less of this bitch pls. she's annoying lol
The princess and the penis
I did not know ow she was lesbian
WhY dOes sHe kEep sAying CRAPES OMFNSHCHSHSUXHSBA
I'm dying.
Cr-eh-p....not cray-pe
There's a p#### on the cake
Idk why Rie reminds me of Yumi from Code Lyoko
Wait,what ?! Niki is lesbian beacuase she have wife  . . . Or niki is a man (｡ŏ_ŏ)?
The way you people pronounce craaayp made me shiver.. also flipping with your fingers? 200% would NOT recommend.. it will get torn up, fingers are dirty and you won't be able to put it on a plate gracefully. Use a spatula...or basically anything else instead. I feel bad for her tho she really tried D:
Wonder how many time niki has broken her pinkie
I never you have a wife
I WANNA EAT THIS
That was really cute
Did they blur the cake?
"I am a big fan of creeps" ok
Wait.......niki has a wife!!!
you need to learn how to do the pan flip for crepes
Rei always can analyze & make solutions.... she is so amazing....  Good job funny gurl you are talented
I really love watching these 2... seriously funny....
My recipe is: A mug full of flour A mug full of milk Two eggs A pinch of baking soda
Why do I have this crush on Rie?
😋😋😋
riee~~
Entomology of the word ganache https://www.evs-translations.com/blog/ganache/ It's a person of low intelligence, what the chef yelled at the person who made a mistake, creating this recipe. According to that source anyways.
OH! BTW, I love these shows because it takes practice to make something well! and there's plenty of failure before success!!
WOW. why does Rie know EVERYTHING!!! so impressed.
Nikki is lesbian?
I love Rie. 😭😭😭
she cant cook to save her life
0:55
ANDREW AND NIKI AGAIN
Omg she’s MARRIED ❤️❤️😱
I like how she said crape
Niki calling her wife to have her back up her crepe skills is GOALS
when she said wife i thiught she was joking like friends call each other wifey but then i was like O SHYTE
if you love crepes so much learn how to pronounce the word
Andrew’s face when he heard about the penis tho 🤣🤣
I do not want to be rude or mean or stuff like this but... is she lesbian?
You don't use batter that's quite as thin and you spread it out using a tool, otherwise the crêps will be to thick👍 You can't just add more milk to make the crêps thinner😂
Niki is a lesbian nooo
I work at a crepe restaurant and was amazed how different she makes her crepes compared to mine lol.
Is the crepe made by alexis 🤔
Niki are you a lesbian?
Only at tasty can you make 3 crepes at once😂
Bruh Rie is like...why the fuck am I here
Good job Nikki
5:10 😂
I love Nikki. ☺️
Is adam single?
Maybe it was the milk 😂
Rie is so adorable...
Any one else say pronounce crêpes,  cr-eh-pes ?
You are pronouncing Crèpe so wrong
Why don’t people at Tasty use a knife for cutting? A fork isn’t a knife!
CRAPES!!?! I think you mean CREPS!!
I came here because of Kennedy
Adam doesn't care about no bad milk
I always just wait for Rie to show up. Always a delight to see her cook/do basically anything lol
ever wonder why the french created a special rount hot-plate with a destinct wooden tool to spread de batter? maybe you should try using that!
Crepes are exactly like British pancakes
Who else is hungry.
Wife??
Fuck she is stupid
DoNt gEt EgG jUiCe On My pInKy
Like azzyland always says..... DELICIOUS!!!
One question. Is Nikki a transgender?
Is she drunk ?
That looks more like the thing to cut watermelon.
Rie reminds me of horror movies from japan
How the fuck i got here at 3 am?
She did nothing wrong it is the heat top she is using. in another video i watched they tested to see the range of heat by a flour test and only an inner circle burned the flour  so it is not her fault her crepes were cooking funny.....3:21........
Oh
Wife!!
There could be another compilation/clip show called. "Rie to the Rescue."
Plot twist: They all got diarrhoea because of the milk.    Jk Love your show btw...😍😍😍
Crepe is pronounced ‘crap’ in Dutch, lol
Chocolate crap cake is what i heard ;-; XD
the pan has to be a pan with shorter edges and a wider base
Ok so I’m Russian, I literally learned how to make crapes at the age of 5 or 6
Rie is waifu
YOU HAVE A WIFE? OMG I DIDNT KNOW DAT 😂
WTF ITS MY IDEA MY TORTA DE PANQUEQUES
Notice how her laptop had a "queer" sticker  on it...
Too runny liquid. Another rookie mistake
Watching Americans try to watch crepes is funny
"Sigh" Where's Andrew!!!!
at 12:08 does anyone see the little blurred/pixeled thing on the left
I ship her and adam because I’m an annoying shipper
Is niki a girl or a boy
niki's wife ????
i feel like rie is a professional chef nd whem she sees the others do sth she's like 'these little fucker took all day. i did this in 2 minutes.' lmao
she really funny
she has a wife?
is she ***
she is so so funny
Is she lesbian or not?
Esta es la tipa que pregunto que se sentía ser del mismo género que Donald Trump?
I tried this...I failed.
I feel like Adam just gives people challenges when he is hungry
WTF I DIDNT KNOW THAT THEY WERE TABLE SPOON MARKINGS ON THE SIDE OF BUTTER. Thank you so much lol
On of my favorite segments for sure
Rie said I don’t remember lol
Did they censor the word penis?
What do they mean by Niki wife ???)???????????(??????(?????
Where's Andrew?
Niki is lesbian
The way she says crepe annoys me 😂😂 “ I never made a chocolate crape cake😂
word of advise from an actual crepe chef: ADD SOME MORE FLOUR also i ALWAYS use whole milk, fat is not your enemy in crepes
The best by date is the expected date for when it will go bad but a lot of the time a product is good up to two days after the due date. With dairy and meat products I don’t recommend ignoring the due date but I have done it before with milk two days after. I smelled it first then used it in pancakes. Nobody got sick and they tasted great... so 😆 Yeah haha
I thought she was going to say Eating Your Feelings 😆😆 I was like this is my channel.
More Niki
This is like Baumkuchen. Have to try this very very very soon. haha
Fun fact: milk actually expires a week or so AFTER its expiration date.
12:08 why did they censor a small part on the crepe
I cringed at the way she said crépes
I say it crep she said crape
Niki is lesbian
Wow she's transgender I never knew. I never saw a transgender
as an european, what the fuck is this??? that is n o t how you make crepes
Rie... Chef extrodinair....
Aren't these just called panecakes in europe
10:07 ... you’ll thank me later
Rie got some skills
Wanted to say f word lol
U have wife?
Eating Your Feed would not be perfect without the appearance of Tasty Producer Rie 😊😂
Rie is da best <3
That rainbow whisk seriously tripped me out
She's a lesbian?
Rie looks like a mom who told her daughter she wasn't gonna help her bake but ended being dragged into the disaster anyway
4:42 why did she sound like bart
you can put a plate on the crepe, flip the pan, then transfer with a second plate back onto the pan. I've used this to flip the most unflippable things, like giant hashbrowns.
Love to see people make the tasty video’s!! It looks so fk damn easy, I can’t
Me: *breaks pinky  Doctor: don’t get any egg juice on it
Adden and jenna marbles boyfriend sound the same
Crep not crape
you forgot to add the powdered sugar
I want to be Niki just so Adam could be my best friend
Crape's???
It was cuz of the milk
"wife"( seriously?)
Rie is the fairy godmother. Saving all the recipes! You go Rie!!!
that girl is lesbian dd
W8, she's  a lesbo?
Console ship in cooking video lol
Yum
this show needs to be called "adam challenged me'"
Sponge bob is shoooookk
You gay but your so pretty
She lied when her wife repeated her question and then hesitated 😂😹
She is lesbian? If she is cool btw I’ve never tried crepes are they good?
Are you lesbian Niki
Crape
Anyone else pronounce crepe like “Crep” instead of “Crape”? It really annoyed me
12:09 does anyone see the blur effect on the cake?
She killed it
Does niki has a wife 👰😅😵😳😱😰
the tasty chef was kinda rude !
cringing every time she so horrendously pronounces crêpe.
Niki has a Wife? She’s a lesbian?
Crêpe = Niki says Craip
I thought she was Ashley, but then ik she left buzzfeed
if adam is  challenging u to cook challenge him
why don’t they just use a crepe pan
She is gay
Does anyone else not like Rie
3:37 ur using the same size pan lol
her wife?
Cant stand when she does the episodes. She cant controll her pitch or volume at all... like a danm stereotypical valley girl... how is one supposed to control their phone volume watching this??? Bring Andrew back.
What the hell niki have a girl! Wife omg
I love Niki and Rie
Rie is super cute
She did so good! The ganache was kinda too thick but overall she did really well! I am very proud lol!
We all need a Rie in our lives
When I heard the word wife, I immediately stopped watching.
Dude. Bro. Man. Senpai. Brosiff. She sounds like Ellen Degenerous!!!! (I know i cant spell)
0:00 o queso
I tried to look like I have Down syndrome in the thumbnail should be the title
You go girl  Go niki  Ríe  Andre  And Niki  You are favourite tasty producers
They always need Ríe  My g  I don’t know but when Ríe arounds  Problem Solve hahaha
I’m just so confuse now  Andrew or Adam  What his real name
is she lesbian? not judging just wondering not trying to be offensive
I hate the way this girl speaks.
I have never seen someone mix milk and eggs like this before
When you pile crepes like that, doesn't it just become a short stack of pancakes?
I was excited to watch thus video but then i heard how she said CREPE and i died i had to stop watchin
Just saying not hating, your ganache is much thicker so I suggest whipping the ganache more and try to pour the ganache as fast as you can. The ganache can set very fast so that's why you would want to pour it right after you make it. I'm not judging, just a reminder. You guys are amazing!
J
"We're adding sugar to the cream but not too much because theres sugar in the cream"
I love the fact that Rie is like there mother
Maybe, just maybe, the expired milk made the mix bad... XD
wait shes lesbian-
I hate the way, americans pronounce "Crèpes"
So they mean crêpes?
A day expired milk isn't bad. It doesn't make you sick or anything.
NIKKI IS MY FAVORITE PERSON.
Is she gay ?? Or lesbian
I could call my wife........whaaaaaaat
I thought he was a girl
I FUCKING LOVE RIE
who else saw the missed high five? 12:04
Why is everyone gay in this channel?
“IVE MADE CREPES BEFORE RIE”😂😂.  5:49
yOU FORGOT THE POWDERED SUGAR!!!
Hire me.
Niki:"ouhh mother fudger"😂😂
We need a format Where Adam cooks MAKE IT HAPPEN
Omg rieee 😍😍😍😍😍😍

Oh YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA who else remembers Niki's and Kelsei's Wedding???AMAZING!!!!!!
I have never heard anyone pronouncing crepe so wrong... I can’t watch this video this freaks me out so much
Right when the sexy music played and the chocolate was about to pour iver the cake the video stopped v.v are you kidding me
7:59 i thought you where gonna make a nose but ok
Its basically cream and chocolate because you can barely taste the crepes
You added milk to the bowl before the eggs and then tried to mix it? This is how I know you aren’t an actual baker by trade.
The things that you call crepes, we call pancakes in my country
Niki calling her wife was so sweet oh my gosh
The crepes look to thin
crepe, crape one is the way YOU say it and spelt wrong ,one is the way your meant to and is the right way to spell it
not crape
crEpe
I love Rie. She's so chill.
anyone know Niki or Rie Instagram?
It's not craip it's crep
One question who washes the dishes? 😂😂
11:33 sexual
I hate how she says craips and not creps (pronounces)(it isnt writen like that
I have a broken pinkie finger :'(
Am I the only person who pronounces crepes as (cr- rep
Niki's new catchphrese: OuchieMama!!
Lol princess and the peen
you spelled crepe wrong its crapes
I was surprised when she added more milk to that batter, it was kinda obvious the batter was too thin, well to me at least
I think she should have used an non-stick skillet like in the Tasty video.
I used to make crepes every week and I’ve actually never made pancakes before
rie is such a savage
Niki: Andrew is my best friend SIKE Adam is my best friend   Me: hahahahah Andrew well done Adam
This is eating your feet
Is the chef lesbian?
her saying "i could call my wife" added like, 30 years onto my wlw life
I was kind of bummed out, then watched this, and not bummed anymore. Lovely, thank you!
5:09-5:11 Chingu yaa😂😂
I wonder where she gets her clothes!
U dont make crepes on a pan like that and u flip them by hand
Lmao America why yall so extra
you're making crepes and im eating grapes
Once my school accidentally served past date milk and I realized. I screamed it out and the whole cafeteria freak out xD. It was hilarious
It is not crapes
Rie is so so so cute af!!!
It’s triggers me how her wife said cr*ay*pes
DON'T READ THIS. YOU WILL BE KISSED ON THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. NOW THAT YOU STARTED READING DON'T STOP. THIS IS SO FREAKY. 1. say your name 10 times 2. say mom's name 5 times and your crushes name 3 times 4. paste this onto 4 other games. If you do this, your crush will kiss you on nearest Friday possible. But if you read this, and do not paste this you will get bad luck. SEND THIS ON 5 DIFFERENT GAMES IN 134 MINUTES. WHEN YOUR DONE PRESS F6 AND YOUR CRUSHES NAME WILL APPEAR IN BIG LETTERS. THIS IS SO FREAKY IT ACTUALLY WORKS
Lesbian
I'm going to call my husband too. Equals 3. Just the Tiiiiiiiiiiiip~
Yes I tried to make the original video n it was crap 😝
Bootiful xD I wanna eat that right NOW!!!
As honest as it can get, no airs abt how perfect the food looks and esp how easy they show it to be to make such delocate stuff.... But man my heart goes out to the person who has to clean all these dishes!!! more challenging than making the recipe itself.
Who else noticed the failed high five 12:04😂
I didn't know Nicki is gay 😱
*ffffffffffflip*
Nikis WIFE?!? ok is she lesbian or bisexual?(I’m sorry to be rude ☹️)
Flipping crepes(pancakes) are easier than scotch pancakes(american ones)
I feel like with some practice, I could make this! Thanks Niki 😁 now I want to try
nice peanis
Niki has a wife and its a girl omg i want them to see
wait wait a Chinese lesbian right?
Love this girl lol
i love adam and rie they are just cutie pies 💖
Wait Niki has Niki a Wife which means???      I don’t know 🤷‍♂️:)
The way she says crepe really annoyingggg
________
How did she break her pinky? Hope she’s ok, that shit must hurt😧
How do you make the cream?
I think the crepes didn’t hold together at first because there wasn enough gluten. Gluten usually binds everything. I’m no chef so idk😐
I just can’t get over how she is pronouncing “crepe”
DONT BUTTER THE PAN!! But such a good vid
I like how they failed at the high five and they added a sound in for it
I love that the fact why she's struggling at 1st is cause of the tasty one top being useless.
She looks Like Matthias
rie is just dying in the corner when she said *”there’s a penis”*
I want to try crepe cake so much!
2:45 she sounds like Francine from American dad
Every time you say “crape” a french person dies
I love Rie...😍
Aside from not knowing how to say crepes, why don't they use a crepiere pan?? Seriously
You know some thing PANKAKES
Crahpe cake or crêpe cake? 00:25
I wish theres a link of ingredients 😊😊😊
well maybe coz your batter was way too watery and you made the crepes way too thin, so ofc they were gonna rip apart.. and its crEpe not craype tf..? and btw you're annoying AF
Your an overacting market.
0:54 her face is like..... I don't know what to say
Lmao cream watch only singaporeans will get it
Im I the only one who wants two scoops batter instead of one?😂
I love Rie. Like, she's so professional with her skill level in cooking but she's also so silly. Fun Tasty mom ^.^
I love crêpes!
If u think that's what a penis looks like u haven't seen a penis before then
He need some milk
#LGBTQ+ be happy your a lesbian Niki<3🌈🌈🌈
Is that her wife fr ?
Yes girl! Call your wife to back you up!!
It’s not crepe cake it’s crepe cake
Y mi mamá se saca la cresta haciendo 60 panqueques en una tarde pa que tres culiaos lo comamos en media hora
Tnx to rie
It crepe not creep lol
8:00 tho lol
Come to South Africa, we will teach you how to flip it...
at first i heard you said grapes instead of crepes and i was so confused
12:03 they missed their clap
The way she says crapes 😂😂
Cmon man you cant do a pancake
She is saying crêpe wrong!!(I'm French)
Why are these so entertaining? I watch them like movies
rie reminds me of someone from the incredibles,???
THEY’RE SO PRECIOUS
I just want rie to bemy mother....oh she's soooo good
This is cooking....but not really
What a nice cake !   Beside that is that true niki ? Your wife ?  Hmmm surprised but You entertain us all :D
Rie is a gem
ok is it just me or @ 3:35 does it sound like he’s in your head
Didn’t know Nikki had a wife lol
Niki: there's the penis Andrew:*laughs* excuse me?
I respect that niki likes women
If you don't like Rei, you are a disgrace to humanity
🤤
Take a shot every time Nikki says ow
1:13 she loves fat wow nicki but at least you ain’t tubby
When she started calling her wife I realized how she broke her finger
"Craype"
I’m probably never going to make any of the food videos I watch but they look so yummy.......!!!
Nikki is my favorite to watch on tasty
They should make it extra chocolate by making the whip cream chocolate
when Niki has a broken pinkie and also being fansy and regretting herself but saying g she is good at making creape
I hate when people act dumb af!!!
Theres a similar concept yet different version for this kind of cake in malaysia called kek lapis sarawak. Check it out.
Both of you were adorable. Loved it. 5 stars ladies.🎉🎉🎉💖💖💖💖
8:41 -8:45      Keep replaying it     Thank me later
Cmon a crepe cake, that is awful. Real danish pancakes/crepes are the best, i could get you our recipe.
“CrEyPe”.   I say Crep
It does look like what it was supposed to be.
This was a journey!! And I’m glad i was part of it 😂
This girl is sooooo annoying. OUT
Nikki is a Lesbian I thought she was Normal
Crepes are... Not hard to make.
Wow! Thumbs up 👍 to you for so much work. Looks yummy!
Hello diabets
Niki: motherfudger! Me: Thats what my Brothers calls me! 🤣
WAIT Nikki is lesbian? Because it said that she called her wife or something
WAIT Nikki is lesbian? Because it said that she called her wife or something
Rie is like everyone's mother
Everytime once of them say “Okay, so... here we are” kills me :D
Adam is nut
This girl is my spirit animal
IT LOOKS SO GOOD I WISH I COULD TRY IT😱😭
I’m pretty sure ganache means idiot in French because ganache was a mistake by string too much milk into a chocolate mixture but it tasted good so they named it that
The way she’s pronouncing crêpes is so cringey to me omggg  1st of all there’s no ‘’s’’ pronounced at the end cuz it’s a French word and we don’t spell the ‘’s’’ at the end. And second of all it’s not ‘’krApeS’’ ffs it’s more like crep, the ‘’e’’ in it is pronounced like the ‘’ea’’ in ‘’dead’’ 🤦🏼‍♀️
am i the only one that has kind of a crush on rie?
I call it the "Death by Chocolate" Crepe Cake
Wait she has a WIFE what the F**K BUT........ WHY? She’s so BEAUTIFUL UHHHHH!!!!!
You could instantly hear the nervousness in Kelsey’s (Niki’s wife) voice when she said “I need to ask you something and you just need to answer honestly” 😂😂😂
Best crayps I've ever seen
My friend made this cake after watching this video and gave me none. Hah.
Crapes? That's a weird way to pronounce "crêpe"
When you're Mexican and you know it would be so easy to flip the crepe on the hot pan because your mom makes you flip tortillas every day
I LOVE HER AAAAAAAA
niki is my absolute fav, btw how is your marrige niki, i hope its going great! have a wonderful day/night.
I like how that when Niki starts a video she says "OK"!
She is such a unappealing person. Shane was right to ditch her
Rie is so sexy. Oh GOD!  😂
Now I want a Crepe cake!!!
me in the future: "i can call my wife, she can tell you"
The crepe cake and the penis
“Creype” *creype* *CREYPE?* ITS CREPE PRONOUNCED CREP idk my british self got triggered dont hate me
What is a crape?
Rie’s face when niki said that she’s made crepes before is sooooo cuteeeee
For us french people making crepes is like the easiest thing in the world, we don't even use a recipe ! :p
I watched the entire one minute app ad without skipping because I love you guys so much.
Nikki is lesbian
Crepes isn't pronounced 'crapes' it's pronounced 'creps'
It's pronounced creps not creips
Its crepe not crapes
Its mulok not milk
The two best cameramen ever Are Adam from Buzzfeed and Andrew from Shane’s squad.
Did she pronounce it "crape"?? It's "crep"
Why do you say crepe like grape? i dont think thats how you pronounce it
so nikki is gay!
we all know that one person that is so good at everything that it's almost infuriating, but no one is upset about it because that person is so great. Rie is that person for Buzzfeed.
"Crape".ocd.😫🙄
Hair ....
❤
I was shipping niki and adam but then the phonecall... it made me sad :(((
"I'm a big fan of creeps"
She’s so shit wtf
“I’m pretty good at making Crepes” Well you cant fucking pronounce it sooooooo
OMG ANDREW AND ADAM FROM THAT OTHER YT CHANNEL 😪
She put the penis on the cake 😂😂😂
Niki.....Lesbian????
When a girl says "my wife" my gay heart grows 3 sizes.
I hate Nikki. She seems so awkward and trying to overcompensate for being boring.
Imagine insteadof whipped dreme, alternate nutella, dark chocolate, and whipped cream..then to top it; tap some cocoa powder on top.
Niki wife?
HOW DFUQ DO YOU PRONOUNCE CREPE? OMFG
I stayed up until 1:00 watching YouTube like if you do the same
Nikki is cute
Rie’s batter is a thic boi lol
great final product niki! :)
She’s like a comedian chef. 😂
Great job, Niki! I don't know how to make crepes or cakes and that looked DELICIOUS!! I'd eat that. Can u come and make it for me, pls? 👍👍
10:29 did anyone else laugh.
What was Adam doing behind the bowl? XD
I want rie's recipe for the crepe and the chocolate cream
I hate that she can't be bothered to understand the science! Just watch Alton Brown.
Crepe NUMBER 1!!!!! 19 more to goooooo.......
"I can call my wife" *Why* did that make me smile so much??????
I'm almost 18 and never had a crepe, am I the only one? 😂
Is tasty a buzzfeed channel?
I thought she said rape cake 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
11:03 so how much chocolate did she use?
“ouchie mama”🤣
" ouchi mama " ☺😊😀😁😂😃😄😅☺
I like how she put the pe*is on the cake
?
Is Kelsie 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
10:30 me when my mom cooks at night
Wtaf did she just call it a CRAYP
I love andrew
All I'm thinking about Is how many molecules from their mouths landed on the food..😂🤢
6:09   Her wife ????
8:19 😂😂😭💀
Why is she saying crapes Not crepes
Moooore, I love this series
It’s crepes not crapes😂
Why is she saying crepe like crape
homebuddies!
Rie is number one chef in tasty
Her saying "I can call my wife" is probably the most satisfying thing I have ever heard.
is niki lesbian
Hold up 5:59 What do you mean wife????????  I mean WHAT?!?!
I didn’t know they say crepes like that. It’s painful to hear....
It's kind of a rule that the first crêpe fails though
Niki's wife?!?!?!
Whatching americans doing crêpes is so sad😭 I know not a single french person who would flip them with their hands
Niki's wife  awe how cute.
10:06 Adam os me watching my mom in the kitchen.
5:51 Have you really?... Have you? Girl The way this Has been going I was doubting you ever use a pan. I mean sorry but Seriously what The hell was that?!
4:44... I... I cant ... Just ... come on... How can you claim you can cook anything if your idea to flip a freaking crape is to pick it up with your fingers =_=' . Do you flip burgers by hand too?!  Use a bloody spatual like every normal person that can cook. ugh
bloop bloop
girl don't be jelly of rie         owo i  probably would be too uwu
The way she says crepe ughh
*_IM A BIG FAN OF CREEPS_*
turned out to be a crap cake
8:00 😕
Adaaaaam
Wait wt... im confused did she say wife? Wut?
Americans say crêpe that way because of the rules regarding stressed vowels in American English pronunciation. The French pronunciation requires an unstressed vowel in what should be a stressed syllable in English thus rendering the pronunciation very uncomfortable to the American mouth. The vowel we use normally is a diphthong that combines that original e sound with an i sound making it easier for us to pronounce.
Fucking he’ll stop paying attention to how they pronounce shit and enjoy the fucking cake.
Actually there is special pan to make crepes lot more easier https://youtu.be/_Vh2gaxlvro
Oh look, it’s my friends! HAI FRANDS! [friends pokes head out back door]Me: Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha are they going to help you?
they moved to tasty channel, i haven't notice it. They used to be in BuzzFeed channel.
To wet add milk???
this made me happy
If i could have a job just to cook and get paid that be great
Literally the most just.. flat out boring people in the world.
Milk is good about a week after the best by date
is it just me or is she annoying as hell
It was so weird when u covered the u know dick on the pan funny  because most people know what it is and Ur covering it lol,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wait Niki has a wife ... but she’s a girl

Of course this bitch is a lesbian
Next time use rubber gloves so you don't get burnt
Lol I love her rainbow whisk
"Creps" not "Creapes". I was cringing this whole video...
YUM
A bunch of classes including our class at school made crepes this year and last year, the chef that taught us was from France so he taught all the English classes a bit our french. The French classes already know french so they didn't need to learn anything else.
First time on this channel and I could tell she was gay even before she called her wife XD
I'm from Russia and crepes are our national food, we even have a holiday which is cold "Maslenitsa" when we have to eat crepes the whole week (but I still sucks at cooking them). And we have a really flat pan for cooking crepes. It is really useful.  And I also heard, that you need to oil them when you cook, so they won't dry
wow I thought I was bad at cooking...but now I feel better 😅
Beautiful.
I want to see more videos of these two. Such good chemistry and so cute!
I'm not hating im just surprised
W8 wut?!?? She is a transgender?!?? Or is it just me
Ganache means mistake in french
I don't know why she had to use her hands. Doesn't she know how to use a spatula?
Didn’t they have a recipe in the Tasty video? I saw the video and I could have sworn that there was a recipe in the video
At 10:07 did you see the face stick up in the corner
is she transgender cause she have a wife
Min 10:40  It means Donkey in French i Think 😂
crayp
My heart sunk every time she said "craypes"
Hey niki :P
Not to toot my own horn
Salted or unsalted butter?
That lady is always hovering and being judgemental
rei the recipe saver 😂
Rie is the boss
I don't like her
my wife
LOL people need to understand that crêpe is the French way to say it, yes it's originated in France but the way she says crepe in the video is how almost every single English speaker says it.
Not enough flour 😂😂😂
The princess and the penis 😂😂
hahahahaha WHERE THE P LOLOLOL HAHAHAHAH
well that was funny...so many attempts....but i probally needed to make more
you need a griddle flat surface and a fliping spatula
I've been making and eating crêpes since I was a kid (you say it crraillle-puh by the way) and the best recipe is definitely 1 cup flour 1 cup milk 2 eggs 1/4 cup sugar. No need to let it rest even. For choco crêpes just add 1/4 cup cocoa powder and boom. Kazam. Done. Also, with those, don't hesitate to pour more of the batter. To make this cake, go thick or go home.  Oh, and little advice: if you make 2 batters with different flavours, you don't have to sugar your whipped cream. Leave it plain and it will act like a palette cleanser.
Waaaaah she's not pronouncing crepe correctly. Wahhhhhh.
Holy shit she is talks like a stereotype.
It looks like injera
I thought crepe was pronounced creep.......😂😂😂
I THINK crazy crapszzllol
i understand why she's already married. i'm jealous because she's so charming.
She is so nasty!!  Sniffing the milk like that?? Where’s the hygiene at??
The princess and the penis
Chocolate idiots
4:37 lol 😂
and the bitch is lesbian
this bitch is dumb as fuck
"Mother Fuuuuuuu-dger"  -nikki2018
I love how Niki just casually call her wife, THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS SO CUTE THO, I SHIPPED THEM FROM THE BEGINNING AND THAT SHE FINALLY CALL HER WIFE I WAS SO HAPPY :D
1st crepe is always the WORST XD IT'S A UNIVERSAL LAW
Wait Nikki has a wife
You say crepe, South Africa says pancake. You say pancake, South Africa says flapjack. I am confusion.
Ewwwww she is gay
12:09 they added the dick to the cake 😂😂😂
Those crepes look gross. You need a crepe pan to begin with.
OMG IS IM THE ONLY ONE ThaT DIDNT NO SHE HAD A WIFE
Too many of these comments are people whining about the pronunciation, not everyone says everything the same. Y'all are so whiny
Niki is bi!?!?
“Bloop bloop bloop” that just cracked me up
This is the best channel ever! Thank you thank you muah 💋
I love Nikki
I love this so much. Please make more of this series
The crepes weren't cooking the best cause she was using the tasty one top and that doesn't cook evenly
Tell me why the song from 1:08 - 2:48 is such a good crépé making song
Nailed it.
I feel like everyone rea works with she hates
Andrew
I have an idea! How about layers and layers of giant macaroons? = MACAROON CAKE!!!!!!
I absolutely adore niki! she's the cutest and that call to her wife blessed my entire day. also, the cake looked really good? worth all the work lol good job, guys!!
Rie is lowkey hot af
Crepes aren’t always supposed to be paper thin, I think they’re better a little bit thicker
I love how Gordon Ramsey mocked this on Masterchef and now it’s a real craved after dessert 😂
She say she loves it but she pronounced it wrong
I always try ta make these things but don't have that ingredients so I improvise....... And my cake ends up tasting like a wet buttcheek😑
I get weird vibes from Rie...
She flips crêpes with her hands??
Miruuuuuuu crepeess
is that girl who call is lesbian
I know there has to be an immersion blender in the Tasty kitchen!
one suggestion is when the sides are becoming crispy its time to flip
This makes me want to cook
Delicious 😍😻
In my country crepes are like a thing small children cook because you literally cant fuck it up...
Rie is pro ... !!! <3 !!!
The cooktop is the issue, it only heats up the center. That’s why the center was cooking faster than the rest of it.
the problem was just in flour .you didn't put so much flour.sometimes I also had that problem but I just add more flour .
If u love crépes so much, pronounce it properly
How tf did she manage to break her pinkie?
I think it’s pronounced crep
She is using the wrong pan 🍳.... You never can cook crepes right in a non sticking pan ...
wrong pan for making crepes... *facepalm* also, you're supposed to flip them in the air. lol
#1 PROBLEM IS the WRONG PAN
They look like pancakes
*"Mother... fudger"* We all know what she was really going to say😂😂 8:00 lmao
How do you get (cr-eap) the pronunciation is (cr-ep)
Is there anyone who’s not gay at this freakish BuzzFeed !!
Sorry but niki has a wife i dont know what that means but i dont understand
I always pronounce crepe differently.  Isn't it like crepp and not craip? :D
rie is so cute
I havent eat and i watch this, like bitch you know what i feel like. sooooo     like so my tummy is gonna be full!💖
crapes....
12:18
every time she says crepes like "CR-APES" makes me cringe so hard
12:04 is shade you want to know why  Figure it out yourself 🤪
It looks exactly how the picture looked liked!!!🤯😃
Rie can get it
GUH NAWSH  EDIT: OH GOD, I'M 11min IN NOW, AND IT'S DRIVING ME INSANE.
Omigosh I HATE rubber whisks, wasted my money buying three rubber whisks when I first started baking, before I realised that rubber whisks and esentially useless and more for babies to play with. I finally switched to a steel wire whisk and it makes perfect cake batter
Oh I didn’t know she had a wife and she liked girls?
I want to dig my face into your chocolate cake frosting and drown in it from happiness
"I hope you're rich"
Rie is savage
12:03 she misses the high-five but they add a sound effect .
lol at 12:30 the girl came in and said what is this looking at the failed crepes
It a crepe like a really thin pancake
Gan-are-shhhh im dying 😂😂😂
Lol they mean garnish which is basicly icing on a cake or like decorations which icing or frosting or melted chocolate is
The only good thing BuzzFeed has
How the HELL would that take all day? That would take me like 2 hours, 3 tops.
This makes me laugh
“Crape”  Me:!?!?!?
Algun latino que quiera que lo sigan en su canal? sigueme y te sigo, apoyo mutuo https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA9h4uwQQvJTbJFYB8j9nMA
4:34
Rei is like the Mikasa of cooking
It’s best to use the products before the date on the label. It’s still good to eat though but shortly it will go off
When she said I want to call my wife I thought it was a joke
Is niki lesbian
Omg I broke my pinkie last year and on the same hand as u!!!! My left hand is were my pinkie broke
Your batter is to thin lol. You should have never taken out a part of the flour and left it as it was but add the cocoa powder none the less. Hope that helps :) Also dont substitue full cream milk for skim milk ever lol.
If you add butter on the pan your adding another ingredient to the batter
Why does every american say craip
That face at 0:55
We all agree that Niki IS DIRTY MINDED😂😂😂
4:35- 4:48 IM DYING BAHAHAHAHA
When i farted she started making the farting sound on her hand lol
The crepe didn't cook evenly because the induction stove sucks & gives uneven heat in the middle.
Don't recommend it I hated it, the textures was so weird
No its because youre using a shitty burner with a single eye in the middle instead of even heating that was produced by your video making company that doesn't know how to make cooking products
Im to impatient to make crepe
im sorry but can we get an episode of adam making a dish ? :)
Why do i see gays all the time in yt
This looks incredibly delicious 😋
If you make a lot of crepes, invest in a pan that’s made specifically for crepes! So worth it and it will make your life easier! You can make all sorts of pancakes on it...
0:55 look at her  face
Imma try this hope it turns out okay! 👍
I love you, Rie!
Its a pancake-cake.
Rofl, this girl is a mess.
Niki’s lazy...
Wow didn’t know niki was lesbian
My name is Niki
Creap
It’s not her fault it’s the buzzfeed induction cooktop it doesn’t get very hot
Their cooking skills are totally "crapes", but as entertainment is pretty good
Jesus christ I almost lost my shit watching this...
egg juice EGG JUICE
Lol everyone is friends with Adam 😂😂
I smiled when she finished
Who else hates girls that try to act stupid just to sound "funny". She thinks shes so prestige. You suck. You cant even cook...woman.   Lgbt trggered in 3...2...1...
Its the shitty electric stove, someone reviewed that and it doesnt spread the heat 😂😂 kudos for your patience tho
I'm a big fan of creeps
you don't eat crepe like that.
why is Andrew not in it?
What's a cake! That made me laugh on the way to the end.Thank you for entertaining Me 555.Never,i would  make this recipe myself.I learned a lot of technics out of it.Thank you.Enjoyๆๆ.
Honestly watching Americans try to make pancakes is a trip in itself lmao 🤦🏻‍♀️
Milk doesn't expire it's homogenized meaning there's no bacteria it's just when it tastes best so u buy more
For Someone who loves crêpes you don’t know how to pronounce them
when you don't realize the problem is you're using your companies sh*tty hot plate that heats unevenly....
CAN I GET THE RECIPE
7:07 especerry
11:53 I think Adam forgot to blur the di**
Did anyone notice the laptop said queer on it😭😂😂
I want some!!😍😍😍😍
Niki have wife? Not husband?
that pan is clearly not made for making crépes/pancakes...
I love this series... it's so well-made and entertaining. I hope it continues!!
Obama hates black people
NIKI IS A LESBIAN?!?!?!?
Ha ha, the resting actually has nothing to do with gluten. It’s because of the bubbles in your crepe batter. If you cook your crepes without letting it rest and letting the bubbles settle, your crepes will tear more easily.
Niki's wife ! Is that usual!😶
I freakin' love Rie. She's funny, great at cooking and pretty as well. Plus the fact that she's Japanese which is *V* PERFECT
God I hate the way they say “crêpe”. It’s crêpe, not crape ffs
She has a wife?!?
I stopped watching at "let me call my wife" ...puke...not normal, never will be.
crepe-this is what we called pancake in  my country
Ooh.. it's my friends, hi friends 😂❤😂
I thank this one is better then the original video, just pure cause there is a p**is on it
12:00 they didn’t even high five
That chocolate coating is THICC Im gonna have some of that
When there is something strange... In Eating your Feed  Who ya gonna call??    RIE
When she said she had a wife i was pleasantly surprised - homosexuality isnt allowed in my country
She is married to another women??
The princess and the peanis😂
I have the exact same whisk as used in the beginning
This video is a perfect example of how those short tasty videos are NOT a complete recipe.
As a french person i would love to help you girls, in france everyone knows how tomake crepes it's a very usual thing to make when you're low on money cause it's so cheap, the best advice i could give you is to use a special pan called a crepière! it's a really flat pan with no edges, makes it incredibly easy to flip the crepes just with a fast move ;)
we want steven we want steven  we want stevn
Rie did everything nikki just mixed
Rie is the best. Thats it.
Wait girl married to a girl.....I MUST SUPORT THEM
Wait she has a wife?
I was mispronouncing it the whole time. It’s not crap Rahul!  No wonder the French waiter always looked at me like this 🙄 whenever I ordered it.
the reason you are having trouble making crepes is because you are using the "tasty" burner and it is known to have really bad heat induction
ANDREW IS DADDY😂❤️
Did anyone else notice how when rie came over the pan went from red to blue when they were talking about butter and the color different   Cooking crepes two at a time Three crepes three at a time  Best part
Bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop
I like her... Good video.. Food looks delish... thanks for sharing...
So every birthday I have I challenge my dad with another cake to make so I think this will be perfect! Mwheheh
i <3 Rie
I don’t know about anyone else but they say crayp but it’s said like crep in England it really confuses my brain
Niki  me:HI NIKI
Who else knew it was her batter in the beginning
I keep pronouncing it creep
Is this a coincidence or no, because the girl from ratatouille looks like Rie
I love this woman! OMG. <3 <3 <3
Noup, that's not so yummy...        This is tasty
Rie ! 🎉🎉
Is nikku is lesbian
The way she pronounce crêpe AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"Cream Watch 2018" made me laugh!
Do you pronounce it as “crepes” or “crepes “? I personally pronounce it as “crepes”
Aren't these English pancakes
IS SHE LESBIAN?  Edit: ples answer
Is she gay
Rie is a savage
*Oh*
Why does she say crepe so weirdly
Feels bad for Rie, having to babysit these upstart chefs everytime they decided to make something and then film it Looking at you, Adam
why do I starve myself
next time, don't worry about getting eggs on your bandaid or cut, just wear vinyl gloves
Make a burger cake PLEASEEEE
I hate this girl
Is she gay
omg that phonecall was so cute
Your crepes are my pancakes I live in England and when my mum makes pancakes she always does it the way you do .  Our crepes are basically the same as pancakes maybe just different flavoured batter like yours??
It's a pancake cake. Those are pancakes, not crepes. Fuck USA. Yall trash.
So buzzfeed and tasty are partners???
i didnt know tasty was related with buzfeed. makes sense tho lol
Why do you say it like “creip”. It’s kinda annoying, that’s not how you say it😅
It’s Said crep not crape
Rie kinda looks like the girl from ratatouille
It triggered me how she said crepes wrong the whole video 🙄🙄😂
lol stretch-tite 7:47
Niki is so cute😀
11:34  Insert porn music
what do you guys have against penises?
I didn't know she had a wife and now I love her more
crepe of creap 😂😂😂
You know my sister did this but failed because her’s had not enough cream to stick the crepes together and we put it in the fridge and It froze and it was hard and cold but in the end I ate all of it by myself!
Hahaaha half of the video trying to make only the batter😂
I made a crepe cake for a friend and he said he didn’t want it. I cut the cake in half and wrapped one half up and threw the other in his face. He didn’t understand how long it took m to make that
Never tasted crepe
We love Rie :)) keep going. We love you from Mongolia
You can add a little more Melk 2:29
I love buzzfeed videos because they don’t look scripted and fake unlike other channels. Honestly I LOVE THIS GURL
Wahhh make baumkuchen plez
Wait she’s lesbian!!!
crêpe is the single most infuriating word that has ever been adopted into the English language. every time someone says "cray-pe" I want to van Gough my own ears.
Pannkakstårta!!!
Yumerio patessiure....
It's not pronounced "creyp"! Was this annoying for anyone else?
Poor Adam.
do americans really pronounce it crayp? lol
Isnt this how u make pancakes
You should add about 1/8 of a cup of flour whenever you substitute for dry ingredients
Niki's wife , ewww disgusting
cream watch 2018 10:45
ANDREW
I didn’t know that Niki had a wife lmao
Oh god.... Her technique of flipping annoys me so much
Pause, 10:07 adam peeking his head up kills me hahahaha
More eating your feed episode with Nikki and Rie!
12:09 why is the left side of the cut cake pixelated? What are you trying to hide from us tasty??? #cakeisalie
There's no pea....there's a pe-nis!  I LMAO!
Why is she the cutes Girl
I wish that Rie would stop being in everyone’s videos smh
I feel like the worth it boys and these few tasty people are bec Ming frenz
Why ist there a dude at 10:07 bottom left🙂
She need to learn patience and stop wasting shit.
I feel sorry for the person who has to wash up😣
If Rie isn't there in the show, Tasty doesn't exist anymore. LOL
i was wondering why tasty didn't lend you a crepe pan..... o__o
In every video like this my respect for Rie increases 😂💙
Honestly job well done but it doesn't fudging matter if its even or not. What's up with that
It’s reary thicc
9:03 made me so stressed hhahaa
The girl w the short hair I forgot her name she reminds me of the girl chef from ratatouille
4:16
God she is so attractive
FUN FACT: These are practically Pancakes here in South Africa- minus the coco. The Pancakes people overseas make are crumpets to us.
On my birthday!
I want to eat that so bad!!!
Tasty, can you upload a version where all the "crapes" are beeped out?
Her Wife? I didn’t know she was a lesbian let alone married
I love Nikki! I miss Homebuddies so much. And her crepe cake looks spectacular! I want her and Rie to have a travel food series together, it would be so much fun!
Crepe is a pancake
This episode cured my depression
i wonder what does rie do if she's not being asked for help
12:04 is everyone ignoring that miss... Yeah? .... Ok
6ix9ine
Indiction stove is the worst! xD It's not your fault, + not the best pan but you did great with the tools you had! =) I want to make crêpes now! ^^
Question is niki a tomboy
....food
*Rie's crepe recipe (proper recipe ehe)*  ADD ALL TOGETHER (dry ingredients) -1 and 3/4cup flour -1/4cup of coco powder -7tbsp of sugar -pinch of salt  -then add 6 eggs into dry ingredients  -then add 6 tbsp on melted butter  -then add 3 cup of milk, adding 1/2cup at a time  -then strain the batter.  -let it sit for 30 min (covered in wrapping paper)  *done! or if u wanna make the crepe cake, continue*  -whip 4 cups of cream!(until yoi get a still peak)  -make 20 crepes to assemble them into CREPES  -all you gotta do after that is ASSEMBLE THE CREPES  *how to make the ganache* -2 cups of cream into a boiler  -then add 4tbsp of sugar to the cream and mix them into the cream  -get a bowl, chop some chocolate (dark perferably since you're adding in 4 tbsp of sugar and since cream has sugar in it as well) and add them into the bowl  -slowly pour in the hot cream w/ sugar (about 1//3 of it) , count to 30 seconds then MIX  -spread it all on there nice and thick yumm  -dont forget sugar powder and sprinkle them baby on there as well
Not the best cake but it does look DELICIOUS. Yummy. Can I have a slice please. ❤️😍😋⭐️
So SHE has a WIFE ? Wth
Oh my god, I was so proud of her at the end. lmao
I love niki and I love how she’s not afraid of penis’s and other sexual things
FUCK YOU THE GIRL IN RED CLOTHE,FUCK YOU
You Americans might as well be saying  "crap cake".
Is it ok to use fat milk
"I think it is to thick" me: GIRL I WANT IT TO BE THICKER!!!
For every time she says crepe wrong I die a little inside
Wait I'm confused she's lesbian?
At 13:47 what did you block out on the left side of the cake?
I love how in everyone of these videos people are like, "I need to impress Rie."
Aww rie is so cute
its videos like these that lead to me getting 0 sleep
Did not know Niki is lesbian
10:45      WAS THAT A FLAVOR BUDS REFERENCE?     CHICKEN WATCH FOREVER
she says crepe wrong and it is so annoying! it is just pronounced creep!
Its pronounced. CR-EP not CR-AI-P
Rie is so cute !
She's lesbian
Niki has a wife
I love you guys, but I can't stand the way you say 'crepe'
I think Niki and her wife Kelsie are so cute ^^ do you agree?
I didn't know she was married!
* CHOCOLATE G'NOSSHH * That actually hurt my ears...
That chocolate layer is THICC....       I’ll go home
The sides of the crepes were soft because the tasty heating element only heats the inside of the pan. It's not her. It's the heat.
Oh my god I'm going to try this
What did you do with the extra crepes?
I opened YouTube to find some music because I was battling to study how did I end up here!? I am officially distracted :-(
I’m a big fan of CRAPS
Fun fact: pea in italian is “pisello” which also means penis lmao so the last joke was spot on
This is one of the funniest videos of Eating your feed😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great, they gave their own video credit
is niki a guy or a lesbian?
Rie is The Saver 😂
Is it not crep (as in how it's prenounced ) because it is really annoying me they are saying crapes pretty much grapes
Her batter is waaaay too thin. Same goes for the actual crepes. They have to be thin but not THAT thin
Loves crêpes but cant pronounce it
I want to eat it but it’s just i hate chocolate
I’m expert when it comes to crapes but never made a cake looks so good 🎂💫
"Motherfudger" Watch yo profanity
smith island cake
Wait Niki's lesbian?
I wonder if my batters to thick
Umm I'm fasting this is so triggering
100 LAYERS!!!
Flipping crepes is the hardest thing inchistory
*NIKI'S GAY?!?*
At 12:04 they missed😭😭
Too much work lol
every time Niki mentions her wife my gay little is just so happy 💖
Wait niki has wife?
The way she pronounced crepes REALLY annoyed me. Its not crapes! It’s cr-e-pes
What are they censoring at 12:08?
I love Rie
Love the idea of a Crepe Cake!!!! Yumm!!!! A little tip.... I tried making crepes in a high edged pan like you did. Never again. I’ve had expensive and really cheap Crepe pans... the $19 Pan by Caphilon  (sp) 12” Pan makes crepes from thick and thin batter, no tearing. I understand your pain... oh how I understand!! Also need a thin wide spatula ... very helpful!!  You did a great job - could taste it from here!!😁😎☕️
You gotta love crap cakes
How did she break her pinky
"I no longer feel great about this" Me after any minor setback
Wait is she GAY
Did anyone else notice the censoring????  12:08 12:32  Oh. She put the p#nis on the cake😂👌
*CRAPE?!* FFS IT'S  crêpe krɛp
French people is just like, what the fuck are you doing to those crepes
OH MY GOD I NEED FOOD NOW
Satisfaction definition: This video
I don't know about America but where I live blue top means full fat milk. Also that seems like a lot of sugar for crepes.
NO NICKI it’s pronounced crep not Crape
Egg juice.
Let me call my *wife*
Love me some Nikki!
I made the cake that you just did in this video before I watched it, like a couple months ago, and it was so amusing to watch you go through the same struggle that I did. Except I was a LOT more messy and the cake was less than perfect. I didn’t like it anyway😕 I think I messed up half the batter before finally getting it right
the music really fits nikki!
HOW SHE SAYS CREPÈ TRIGGERS ME SO HARD. ITS CREPÈ NOT CRAYPE😤
whoever edited this video is my new favourite person at buzzfeed   aside from niki
I never liked this girl, I feel like ever since the community pod episode her personality is just rude and weird. It really ruined the episode for me
Love you but the way you pronunce crêpes is sooooooo cringy!
1:05 I thought I was the only one that can do that coz no one I know can.
I love this. But basically buzzfeed just recreate same things again and again?
Rie ♥️♥️♥️  Love it whenever she comes in and just fixes things.
I never knew that Nikki was gay!!?!?!?😱😱😱😱
Idk why but i think i saw her on buzzfeed
The lumberjack is lumberjack no more
does anyone else feel sorry for Andrew?? :C lol
CAN SHE LEARN TO PRONOUNCE CREPE PLEASE! its like crep not craaaaype lmaoo idm tho
Andrew was there and adam but wheres steven
12:32 that’s me
everybody keeps pronouncing it crape but I live in Switzerland and it is pronounced crep
103 EPISODES OF CONSUMABLE NONSENSE - tasty episode -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WfOJyIKKH4&t=11s
Crape?
Am I the only one that gets mad when she says “crapes”..? I call it crèpe
how many grams of chocolate did you use for the gnash ??
Please check this new food channel and do leave a comment https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZRulXU0K0EGaeDe5Y6w0fw
what the person is gay
Need a crepe pan
they miss penis
i love the japanese girl
i use to hate niki when I saw her in other buzzfeed videos but she's soooo cute aaa
niki trying to flip crepes: FLIP OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYY MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmma
omg is niki gaa
cream watch 2018 lol
I know why it’s do not work , you have make it with the false pan , you need a pan who’s “deep” (small)😅❤️❤️
This is how i cook :v almost always failed.
omg Rie looks like Mirage from the incredible just not with silver hair 😱😱😱😱😱
#MoreRie
Her wifes name is spelt the same way as mine woo hoo
niki is fit
Finally someone who can do hand farts like me 😷
Im a random weeb and this reminds me of yumerio pastere (I completely spelled that wrong😂)
I love Rie's hair cut
12:06 I felt the pain,from that high five
Did anyone else notice her rainbow whisk and appreciate it?
12:05 there was a blurred spot on the cake for no reason??
You and your wife should make something for Valentine’s Day next year!!
Uh. Seeing her made me laugh so much. My mom makes crepes like 2 times a week, without any recipe, put a lot more stuff in it than that, doesn't mesure out how much she puts in the pan and they are delicious. Crispy, tasty, golden, YUM. Like... BRUH.
Why is it so hard for people to understand that it's Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve.
Crape?
They didn’t cook on the outside because the tasty one too doesn’t heat evenly
holy crap..that's one huge package of cream the biggest they sell around where I live is around one cup 😂
crepe isnt crape
Omg! Sorry but this really annoys me (it’s pronounced crep not crape)
I like it when they work together
She pronounces crepe like grape
"Such a THICC layer of chocolate."
the cake is nice tho :/
omg i love princess and the pea
I didn’t know that she was a lesbian, not saying there’s anything wrong with that
how is that even though she had them in Paris, she so grossly mispronounces the word Crepe? Do all Americans pronounce it like that?
CREYPS
Americans pronounce crepe weirdly in Ireland we pronounce it 'crep' where as niki pronounces it 'creapes'
Too many Eggs!! I put two for a big Bowl of batter
Rie reminds me of the girl chef in Ratatoullie. 🤣
Omg niki and her wife are so cuuuuttte
12:10 why is part of the cake blurred? Is it because you can see someone in the reflection?
Here in England we don’t have the measurements on the butter and let me tell you, it IS a pain in the bum !!!
count the amount of times she says crepes
*love* this _series!_
please pronounce crepes correctly
I thought crepe was pronounced Cree-pay
I dunno why but Andrew makes my day when he randomly comes in the vid and says "It's good."
missed andrew :(
I love dis
Can we have Niki just talking about her wife it's so cute 💓
She said crepes wrong the whole video and it makes me really annoyed
I believe that the french do a similar thing called Gâteau Mille Crêpes, meaning the thousand crepe cake :)
I wanna see Steven do this!!!
That looks so GOOD!!😍😍😍😍
Where I'm from we make chocolate pancakes (yes, they're called pancakes not /crayps/ literally everywhere else in the world) with chocolate milk. It's easier and tastier.
Well for it to be less chunky mix it a little better before siffting maybe :'D
The crepes need more flour right
OMG please change your pronunciation. Every time you say crêpe it drives me crazy.
They re not pronounced „crapes“ but „Crêpes“ 😂
I love u Rieee!!! ❤ greeting from indonesia
I just love the tasty team
she's a lesbion
Trader Joe's Pound Plus chocolate! Heck yeah, I love that stuff!
Does Nikki really have a wife
you do not make Crepe in a pan you make it in a flat stofe
I LOVE 'EATING YOUR FEED' PLS DO MORE
Why did the last girl that was eating it look like that one asian guy not to be mean
This chick tries too hard to be funny
Looks so much better than the original tasty video 👍👍👍
Did anyone notice the blurr at the side of the cake at 12:08?
Ouchie mama😂
Adam: it feels like your trying to be fancy Niki: no I’m not, I broke my finger and I can’t get egg juice on it. Me: ???? Hhhhhhhhhhaaaa ha ha ha j Read more
This was very entertaining.
rie looked so annoyed at her lmao
where's Andrew?????????????
"Rie what if this doesnt work?"  * Rie laughs suspiciously'*
The music of when she was making the crepe is the same as the music wahbanana use
i’m pretty late. but milk can still be good for up to a week after the expectation date. just have to taste it
I want to join this team so badly
Watching the ganache pour over the cake was orgasmic
What does she mean saying her wife?!
That's not how you pronounce crepes. BuzzFeed lacks quality control. 1/5
The way she said crepe really annoyed me,it’s crep not crape
Soo Niki is lesbian?
I mean, if you replace flour with cocoa you're going to lose gluten.... also I'm just going to keep saying it on every one of these videos but Rie is adorable.
*"GENASSSHH"*
I remember seeing something like this from Masterchef The contestant that made it was eliminated because of it I think.
Make video like this more and more
In Britain they are just called pancakes we call your pancakes American pancakes 🥞
U pronounce them as "crep" and not "crape". It's French. Or u just call them pancakes
I kinda remember why you gotta rest the batter from class this year lol. It has to do with the gluten strands getting all tough cuz you make more when you mix and when you let it relax you're letting them stretch back out
your crepes weren't cooking because of the shitty Tasty hot plat you were using. the hot point on those are centralised and thus the heat isnt even.
I made it and it's good
Nikki is too cute 😂
I can imagine every french person watching twitching every time she says "crepe"
Why is she explaing how to make crepes? 😂 It was the first thing ever learned how to cook when I was a child
I’ve wanted to eat this since I saw it on gbbo😩😭
Roses are red Violets are blue like the ocean You eat your feed I came here to eat my emotions.
What's a crape????? It's pronounced crep and spelled crepe (that's cause it's French)
Hey! Crepes are so delicious 😍. I know that the recipe implies cacao in crepes, but NO 😢, chocolate comes over crepes not into it. To turn the crepes you can move fast the stove, give it an impulsion and it will return the crepe. (I am French, sorry😊 when the batter is too much diluted it is very hard to achieve crepes )  Very good videos good luck
Eww she’s lesbian
I did not know that she was a homosexual
Hey did you work at Starbucks Nikki?
I wish people don't cus
What happened to your little finger
Did you guys know that the date on the milk isn’t expiration it’s just the date the milk has to leave the store
amazing cooking channel...2 lesbian Asians chicks who cant cook! beta males and females, so freaking sad.
12:55  NANI?!
Rie is so cool, the other cast were like tryna get her approval for what they're making
My mum always makes this
XD im looking at this and im remembering the time my grandma did that and mom and a maid and they did well at it (not being rude)
I’m and my crepes are usually a bit thicker than this like putting more in the pan
I HAD A BROKEN PINKY A FEW WEEKS BACK
Goes to show that your hot plate kinda sucks, uneven heating...
cRaPes
Girl I live in Singapore, and a huge fan of cooking, I'd love to talk sometime
AHHHHHHHH I REALLY WANT TO EAT THAT CAKE NOWWWWWW WHY DID I WATCH THIS
Crepes are a British thing, I am British, it's not "crape" it's pronounced Crep.
She said in that she is calling her wife so is she a transgender
I think it was the pan. I have a pan like that and it cooks very differently than my usual pans.
Masterchef LUL that moment
That chef looks like the lady in Ratatouille 😂😂
Niki's wife?
Almost like their hot plate is a bad product....that’s what happens when you have one central heating element🤷🏻‍♂️
i am so fucking glad this is a series now bc that means there will be SO MUCH MORE
A crepe is kinda a dutch pancake
Why does everyone love Adam
Is niki a lesbian???
Funny noises tho lol
I love you Niki!!
This was painful to watch
They deadass censored a crepe penis
Where can I get an Adam? ( ；∀；) He’s so adorable
This crepe tastes horrible I tried to make it
She has a wife?
the way she says crepe is so off putting, it sounds like creep, "I love creeps so much", okay girl you do you. it's pronounced crep
12:04 is it me or is that high five kinda weird?????  Probably me😂
This video hurts to watch.
Loving this series ! 💛
It's not Crapes
Oh my god I'm so hungry now
its the shitty tasty induction cooker that doesnt distribute the heat evenly
3:35 xD
Cut chocolate with a serrated knife! It makes the process easier  ╰(*´︶`*)╯♡
"Cray-pe"
induction, thats why its not working
11:40 food porn
Why have I got soooo many different ads for website creaters like wix?
Your crepe only cooked in the middle at first because the induction cooktop you were using doesn't heat the pan evenly.
mini heart attack at 9:03
Making crepes in a pan     ew
I like her ,butt,...  she says crayp and ganaaach
Oh... look. A recepy from buzzfeed that doesn't work until you try it a billion times....
In the glorious British aisles, we call those pancakes.
1 day pass expiry... Why doesn't people keep their fridge stock in check...
7:19 hun that's because you're not mixing it well you're just scooping it around, don't blame the recipe because your batter isn't great
ok but Rie is the best
you should try and make this pie that's like crèpes, but there's spinach and crème fraiche and other things, and if you do it well the crèpes kinda melt in when you bake it afterwards and it's delicious
SCREPE THE CREPES
she likes crapes
Wait is Nikki a lesbian
I want food rn
Pls make more o these videos
so americans say crepes as crapes interesting
Why didn’t you use the electric hand whisk to whisk the crepe batter?? No unnecessary straining 😂😂😂
You should just Add more eggs
I really like C R E A P S
I too am a fan of crap making
if u say CREYPS one more time imma kill you      ITS "KREPP" CREPPEEESSSSS
Oh my god that looks amazing 😮
its hard because you're using tasty's shitty stove thing
l think that its just a stack of thin chocolate pancake
Ganache means Mistake in french, I think it's french.
This felt like a mom and daughter making cakes together a mess but they figure it out as they go...Together!
MORE EPISODES MORE SEASONS MORE MORE MORE
Lol dosa  is much harder n women in India make it seem soooo fkin easy especially the super big "paper" dosas!
Yasss Tasty Such a bloody great channel!! Id love it you could go give my channel a look!
7:59  Niki; “it looks like a penis”😂😂😂😂😂😂
The crappy induction plate is the problem
Why isn't everyone appreciating Adam and his random food tasting 😂
Sooo is niki lesbian?because when she called the girl asking her if she’s good at making crepes,it said niki's wife
Damn you’re hurt
The way she said flip in 4:42  Made me laugh my butt out she sounded like a cartoon character!!!
Should let it set.
12:09 why did you blurr out the side....?
12:08 Did she stick that crepe penis on the side hence the blurring?  Edit: 13:01 Myth confirmed
it is actually that cooktop that failed her the first time. that cooktop is crap when it comes to evenness and it fails flour burn pattern test miserably creating a small doughnut pattern.   coco powder is no replacement for flour but her first batter's trial crepes seemed like it was going to work if not for that uneven cooktop.  ah well but I guess they can't talk smack about their own product so...
Not gonna lie that ish looks good
I love Niki but every time she said crêpe as 'crape' I just wince...
IS THIS HOW YOU SAY crepe?!?? The hell noooo
I love it when niki get to do the video with andrew XDD! Double the sarcasm and funny (er!)
WAIT SHE PUT THE DICK SHAPED CREPE ON THE CAKE
US2948064 is the number of the U.S. patent for tablespoon measures on the side of butter.
More stuff with Nikki please!
I have made this 3 times 😂
Her wife telling her crepes were so good and tasted like crepes from Paris killed me 😭😭😭 so cute
Whenever I think the mill has gone bad I have my grandma try it to see so I think it's funny how you had Adam try the milk to see if it was bad or not  😂😂😂
The induction cooker does not cook evenly, might nit help
I love this so much!
rie seems so wise i trust her with my life
Yay I love rie
When they all giggled when Niki couldn’t cut the cake with the fork, I melted ❤️
0:56 she reminds me of someone,can’t remember who
Make more eating your feed!
Your supposed to get a crepe pan and flip it with you wrist
“Oh look it’s my friends, hi friends’’ 😂
Everyone says Adam is their best friend XD
I prefer Nikki’s cake crepe more appealing
Milk: one day passed the expiration date and you're worried???? Com'on.. it's not like werewolves and full moon's instant change.
Every time she flips with her fingers I cringe. Isn't it too hot?
Proof that Tasty is all a bunch of phony baloneys. The “behind the scenes” where they fail five times before they can produce their flawless easy peezy video is further proof of how deceptive the videos are.
I appreciate Rie
Ok this was freakin complicated for just making crepes. I literally just mix milk eggs and flour and ta da you don’t even need to rest it or strain it you don’t even need to add sugar, thats what the cream’s for
I thought it was creep
Lmao because it's 1 day past the date doesn't mean it's bad, you can go like a week after depending on the item.
It’s weird that it’s 48 on trending
Bruh biggest plot twist when she said let me call my wife. Nothing against it I was just surprised.
I love seeing her fail, like a really bad fail. But come through at the end 😬
Hearing her say crepe the way she does makes me cringe because we pronounce it’s differently but I love her tho so yh
What she's gay
Coming from a French family,  it bugs me when people say CRAPES. It just sounds so much better as crepps
I love her rainbow whisk
Fun drinking game: take a shot every time she says "ow" or "ouch"
The song they used during the ganache pouring is the same song they used for 'fashion city 2'
Rie is like the cooking Einstein
Her wife?
Wait niki’s lesbian and married well im dumb
WHAHAHA I thought she sed I love creeps😂😂
The background looks horrible. I feel claustrophic just looking at it.
Whats the point of a cooking show with someone who can’t cook?
she's lesbian ????
I love how much enthusiasm she has while rie just wants to get it done it’s kinda funny there the perfect duo 😂😂together please do more of these videos
Not to be rude or anything but is she a lesbian?
If Los Angeles was a person, it would be Rie.
Does Rie remind anyone of Colette from Ratatouille...
A crape cake it is a cr-epp or pancake cake.
TRENDING !!
I’m sorry but, WHY THE FUCK TO YOU NEED TO BLUR A PEICE OF CHOCOLATE CREPE THAT IS VAGELY SHAPED LIKE A PENIS!
Niki is gay!?!?!?😱   (Not judging i am too)
in England they ae pronounced crep not crape and ganache as ganash with and a sound
#teamAdam
no lumps no lumps, no lumps..
Wrong pan, the middle part was hot but  not the edges
04:09 i no longer feel crepe about this
Is whole milk not blue in America. Im confused. Am i understanding this wrong
There's nothing wrong with the batter (about it cooking from the middle) it's because the tasty stovetop doesn't cook evenly.
Crape
she pronounced crepes wrong i am getting anxiety!!!!
5:51 Rie's sarcastic "Oh sure you did" face XD
It's a crepe not that hard to make... Lol
Lol this is basically me making ANYTHING. Mad respect for anyone who makes this at a bakery haha
Wife????
Why u out chinese people in this video
Is she gay?
12:03 dat high-five tho 😂😂
It is crepe not crape
I LOVE ADAM !
Andrew just poking out on that door made my night hahahh
Oh she is so cute, her and Kelsie also are like the. cutest. couple. But as someone who speaks french,  I had to laugh every time someone said "craip", it sounds so cute and funny when they say it XD  Do I have to feel bad about that?
it’s not working because she replaced some  flour with coco powder. flours got gluten that sticks everything together.
Does anyone else flip their crapes by throwing them and catching them in the pan? Or is that only something for pancakes...
Omg that is not how you make crepes why don’t you just stick to pancakes
*S* C R E P E
Watching this like oh ok chill i got this then getting discouraged as you watch her fail some times
Flip it like a normal person not like a pussy
Are you a gay? Why do you have a wife.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm  a big fan of *creeps*
look up how to say crepe please
If your fridge is at a good cold temperature, milk will last weeks past it's "expiration" date without going sour.
Is this not just a chocolate thin layer cake? Or do they only call it that in the south? Either way my mom makes a BOMB one
So everyone in the studio is lesbian or gay? Cuz’ even in buzzfeed!
😋😋😍 don’t make me jealous I’m fasting LOL!
Why she callin them C R A P E S though
„Chocolate krape cake“
You should try to make khinkali
I didn't know niki is gay
We need Andrew back.
Everybody complaining about everything ( her sexuality) Idc and nobody else does if you believe that its wrong. Idc if you say Jesus is coming for her. Not everybody believes in what u believe in so shutt up
So crepes are fancy Dutch pancakes       *im dutch
It’s crep not crape!
I swear I didn't  know that yeah you  would that nike was gay
Her voice is so annoying. Why do you keep hiring weirdos buzzfeed
It’s  pronounced creps not craeps
I Australia they still don’t have the table spoon measurements on butter :( smh
Did the video mention how much chocoate to use? looks like 100-200g??
The Hungarians do it a little differently
"Crapes"
this is the first time i experience the way americans say crêpes and... what
So you a big fan of creeps huh?
and now veganize it
One day expierd milk that hasn't been opened and been in the fridge the whole time  is fine to drink as long as you're not selling it, and to be on the safe side I'd only use it for myself, it's a waste to throw it away.
Rie is basically jesus to all the workers at tasty
Nikkis wife? The hek? Girl to girl?
im so gonna try this during my holidays T.T😍
It's not flipping of cooking well because the buzzfeed-sponsored induction stovetop that they're using is awful. It has a hot spot in the middle, so the inside cooks faster than the edges, causing the crepe to be uneven and brittle. Do not buy this appliance for yourself.
Or there are flat pans that are actually made for making crepes ? That would have been sooo much easier to flip
Is niki a men??
Gordon Ramsay wouldev hated this so much. Anyone get the ref?
How did she break her pinky?
Rie is hella thicc
It look so fancy
RIE!!! 😄😄😀😀🙌🙌
So nickki is gay??
*egg juice* wtf
"Whhhaaaaaaat?!!! She tried to make a chocolate cake? My life will remain incomplete until I watch someone try to make a damn cake."
Riki has a wife that means.....  SHES LESBIAN
Wtf is a crape it’s a crep
It's not pronounced crape ffs
She's so ugly omg
love this!!! Just wanted to point out that you let this batter rest, not due to the gluten, but to help release air bubbles bc if you cook it right away after whisking it will bake with all those bubbles in the crepe.  xxx
Is it just me or is she just so adorable!!!!!!!!!!!  but bts is more cute tho 😍😍❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😍🤣🤣
it's was messing up because you're using the "Tasty one top" it's not all that good
Does anyone else watch these but never actually make it😂😂😂😂😂
I thought Garrett was your best friend
@BuzzFeed can i like job shadow for Niki. I will fail my class if this doesn't happen. Pls help...... (^-^)~
I am hangry now...
"My best friend is andrew" "No its not, its adam"  SO MUCH SHADE
Im sleeping on the floor........ i now know what my dogs feel like......
Shez funnnnnnnnnnnnay
Anyone else notice how when they high fives at the end they missed 😂😂
Um so Rie is my favourite can she have her own channel?
That is satisfing
Guacamole gua gua guacamole.
This editing style is oN pOINt
Rie is the best at tasty not even gonna lie she’s the real mvp
Rie is the best at tasty not even gonna lie she’s the real mvp
Hate dis annoyin  bitch couldn't even watch 2 min
bok ye
this girl reminds me of my nasally sounding boss and I hate it 😭
I want Nikki & Rie to do audiobooks  so I can listen their voices. Rie's is just so... soothing, and Nikki's voice is just fun.
11:52 THE MOST SATISFYING​ THING YOU WILL EVER SEE
ê
I thought this cake would be sooo dense, but how they described it when tasting it makes it out to be pretty airy and light. I guess I’m used to eating thicker crepes.
I feel bad for whoever has to do the dishes
"i tried to make the buzzfeed tasty microwave desserts without failing challenge"
One day expired milk isn't even that bad as long as there is no smell or curdle of the milk, it's fine to use even after a week of the expiration.
LMAOO she put the penis on the cake. I can't.
Patty's Mexican table made this dessert it looks great.
Its that really Niki's WIFE???!!
The cooking mama joke had me dead
Umm??? It might not have worked the first few times because the "Tasty" cooking element kind of sucks. It basically relies on a tiny ring of heat, rather than actual heating throughout. Sorry, but just use a different stove product and you should be fine!
Niki rockin Tech21 case eyyy
Your batter was wayyy too thin
I watch a lot of Buzzfeed, and Adam is always down to try anything. I’m surprised that he isn’t dead from massive food poisoning.
This series is such a hot mess I love it
I almost clicked away, but when Rie stepped in, there was no option of leaving.
I never thought I’d feel so impatient watching someone try to pull a crepe from a pan.
I thought Garret was her best friend
nice
Is Niki straight
I tried it and I fcked up somehow it didn’t work urgh 😩
Woah camera guy is the same guy who eats all the leftovers on worth it winner
I want to eat now
The camera man needs to move tf over out of the frame.
Or buy a crepe maker lol
love hearing rie's accent!!
I remember my Russian baby sitter making crepe cakes. But she did about 100 layers because her crepes were paper thin. But I admire anyone with the patience for this.
I didn’t know she was lesbian
okay but like... thats pancakes... P A N C A KE S thank you
what happened to homebuddies????
Music on my page for the young bulls
That girl next to andrew doenst like it hahaha
More of Nikki
Is she gay
its sad when u dont know ur best friends name
Looks like a sagging Smith Island Cake.  There are some good videos of how to make them too Their texture is just like a regular layered cake, but hey have the multiple thin layers.
Its pronounced creppes not crapes
Why she look like Lilo from Lilo and stitch...
All we need is Steven and we have the WORTH IT TEAM!
If your batter is too thin .. why would add more liquid to it ?
My mom does 4 crepes at a time
How can you be good at making crepes flipping them like that?
they should make a saris called Adam challenges
how the hell do you break your pinkie?? lol the cake looks delicious!
"I can call my wife and she can tell you" is THE BEST SENTENCE OUT OF NIKKI'S MOUTH
I love this series so much!
Ogres are like crepe cakes
You guys copied America's Test Kitchen.
crepe not crape
“Call my wife”? Damn I didn’t expect that
...Or the equipment is not up to your standards. I have watched a lot of Tasty vids where we go 'behind the scenes' and watch them cook from start to finish. Whenever that electric stovetop is used the cooking always seems to be an issue.
The hot plates they use at tasty suck
10:40 Ganache means "idiot" in french (even though we don't really use this word anymore, it's very Vieux Français): the legend tells us that in the middle XIXth century, a pastry chef apprentice  mistakenly pourred cream in a pot of melted chocolate. His master saw it, and called the apprentice a ganache (an idiot, a jerk). But he tasted it, just to give it a try, and was pleasantly surprised. That's why it's called a ganache.
*crayps*
That’s not how u say crêpe if ur a big fan PLEASE learn how to say it🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄!
LOL! When you say you are good at something but then find out you are really not.
Mother fajar.....😂😂😂
I fucking love Adam. Cant we just follow him around like do a day in the life of adam
https://youtu.be/E6bdQaCOXNI
I’m hungry eek
Isn’t she famous? Like an actress?
The way she says crepe ruins the whole video
"Making creeeeeepes two at a tiiiiiiiiime"
crapes  ...
I wanna eat that
Niki is so cute! I like her
Why does she say it like ‘Crape’😂
it drives me crazy every she pronounces CREAP please it’s pronounced CREP
Rie is so shady omg hahahaha
This girl is ugly af oof
Hm in Austria this is what we call a Palatschinke, crepe are much thinner
i like u but i want duo
u just had to put more batter
Actually I'm French and you don't have to say like "ganaaaache" just say simply ganache ❤
Rie is a gift to humanity!
let's have a minute to think of our poor anscestors who had to measure tablespoons of butter with acutal tablespoons
ONCE UPON A MATTRESS
What’s a fucking “cray-pp”. Like grape?? It’s French and pronounced c-rep. Like crap but with an e
wow she is shit at baking. The other women showed her everything. even how to whip properly. how did she get this job?!!
Why is everyone gay in Buzzfeed Wth
the way she says crêpes haha
Its pronounced crêpe
"OH look its my friends, HI FRIENDS"   *Friends peek their heads out the back door*
I could ruin this all Yeeeeaaaaahhhh
me when cooking
2:49 She: No lumps. Me: Thats what she said.
"Craip"
Nikki struggling with making the crêpes because it's not the right pan😂
She’s so cute omg
I hate the way she calls the crapes
Her wife? Is she a gay!!??
the batter was obviously too thin the first time!
Always add the milk last.
Ko Ko Powder         👀
Lost count of how often she butchered the beautiful, tasty word crêpe ; ;
I love Rie's hairstyle, it looks so good on her.
just put in more eggs and abit more flour. not more milk...
way too much milk and you need a crepe stove my french ass is frustrate seeing you cooking crepes
niki is a lesbian
Pls someone explain. HOW CAN YOU THINK THE BATTER NEEDS THINNING WITH MILK WHEN YOUR CREPES FALL APART?!?!?!
i just came in my pants
IM HER BEST FRIEND MY NAME IS ADAM AYYYEEEE
people cooking with long sleeves is my biggest pet peeve.
I couldnt watch this. The was She pronounces Crêpe makes me cringe sooo hard! Thats NOT how you pronounce it! UGH
im a big fan of creyps
Love this woman😂♡
it's pronounced like "crap" not CRAIPE
Niki's wife so shes uhh yea or no?
I have a friend who looks exactly like the girl in the video. She’s a lot more goofy 😂 I miss her
Wow i did not know niki is a lesbian
I guess every European is cringing everytime she pronounces crêpes wrong
i hate the way she says crepes she sais it like crapes
Niki is a lesbian?
12:08 Why is the chocolate censored?
اللهم أني صايم
the girl:i can call my wife she can tell you Me;omg i love her xD HAVE PRIDE
But why do yall call it craipes like saying grapes its pronounced kreps like craps
How the fuck does everyone all the sudden have millions of subscribers
Real flat pancakes (crepes) doesn’t have sugar in it :( I feel offended
I ship u w adam
Is she a lesbian!
12:57 Rie is so adorable loling there
When she added more milk, I was like. 😱
Both Andrew AND Adam? But where is Steven, OMG LOVE Worth it <3
Use a flat stove for god sake ! then you'll be able to flip them without burning yourself ...
Looks like the girl chef from ratatouille
Should of used a crepe pan
"craip"._.
crêpe, that pronunciation is even worse than Americans pronouncing "arigato gozaimasu"..
idk why but i tried hand farting when i saw her do it
I’m so proud of her lmao
Nikki is thiccccc and also lesbo😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You know when you get an add in the middle of the video and then you go to comment on it and realise no one else got the same add as you and your like...well 😑😑😐
Please more Niki videos! She is such fun to watch and exudes a happy warm fun vibe! More Niki puhleeeaaasseee!!!!
I drank an old milkshake and threw up this morning no joke. All over my steering wheel. Now I need to get off the bus because I'm gonna have diarrhea. SERIOUSLY THIS IS THE WORST DAY. I'll have to do it in the woods. I'm dying right now!
I wish people would stop pronouncing it "creyp". Crêpe is a French word and it pronounced "crep".
They should have an "ow" meter because Niki says it too much AHHA
Andrew is quakin
So  much of Asians
omega t h i c c but also it’s crêpes not “crapes”
She is annoying!
Did anyone notice that at 12:08 there's a part that's blurred out? Wonder what's hiding behind there.
Watching americans make crepes is sooo funny
don’t use butter and don’t flip it...that’s how you make it
You’re pronouncing crepe wrong.
If you don‘t want to burn your fingers STOP TOUCHING THE HOT CREPES 😂
I want more of this...regular people failing at baking so I feel better at myself
ami roja rekhe a chocolate er video dkhchi...Allah knw??? Amar akhon ata khete iccha korche...🎂🎂🎂
aww no powdered sugar?
I can tell you like fat.
I wanna work at tasty/buzzfeed just to eat and of course work
So this is where Kalen Allen gets his videos from😂
Is Nikki lesbian?
Buzz dead
Beautiful blend of American and Asian and she cooks!
she often say “my wife” is she lesbian ? 😭😱
Rie is such a waifu
Lesbian?
I thought this was buzzfeed halfway through the video
Did anyone comment that it was actually good though..? LOL
"Oh look it's my friends, Hi FrIIiiIIeEeEnDsS"
Rie: *Mhm*
I wish there was someone on this channel who was straight .
I cringe everytime she says crèpes she says "crapes" please say it the French way
Anyone know why they censored the cake at 12:08 though?  (Edit) Nevermind it was the penis hahahaha
Please pray for my sister Ebeliz, her life is in danger.  Please, even if your not a Christian say a quick 10 second prayer for her.  I love my sister Ebeliz, love her with me for 10 seconds. Thank you, and God bless.
Are you lesbian
12:08 why is the left side of the cake censored? :o
No one has time to watch your bs bloopers in video , kindly be professional n stop this nonsense n make a sensible video
wife? they are lesbian?
Here in France you would get arrested for making crêpes in a friggin pan.
11:32  🍫 ... deliciously hot 😋😋😋😋
"Yeay, like tsuri (three) of them".... That's when I know she came out from the anime.
Didn’t Adam quit?.....
What's a craype?
Rie was kind of bitchy to Niki
Why are you drink the milk
5:50 I’ve made crepes before Rie   Rie yeah yeah  No
26 crepes and 26 on trending!
niki are you a boy or girl
probably didnt cook well cause youre using that god awful buzzfeed hot top
Just discovered this series. Loaded up the three available episodes. Literally all three of them start with "okay, so" Wut.
GET IN MY TUMMY
I thought you said Eating Your Feet
Niki: "I can call my wife, she can tell you!"  Warms my heart!
Jesus is gracious and merciful.
sooo niki is lesbian
I thought the tittle said C R E A M cake   S T U F F I N G
so... the choclified version of the rainbow crepe cake from august 2017... NICE
It's the burner.
So is it craepes or creeps
Why does she fail at most recipes?
But how much chocolate and how much milk do you use for the ganache? :c
That turnes out really good!!!
LAME!!
the fairytale was called Once Upon A Mattress
Cake looks like 💩 poop
The only mistake is the garbage "Tasty Portable Cooktop" she's using in this video 😅
I bet when Nikki asked her wife “ i’m going to ask you question and you need to answer honestly”
My heart skipped a beat when she said she wanted to call her wife. I wanna say that some day you know?  "You know something, I'm gonna call my husband so he tells you I'm great at cooking"
That’s not a crepe pan, no wonder it’s hard to flip the crepes🤣
Bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop
All I could focus on was how many dishes she was using
Hilarious! But damn hard to make...I want one
I want to try the cake...it looks amazing
anybody notice the brad-and-vinny-esque editing on this one? ..
This bitch annoying af
I would like a video about your friendship with your best friend.
Looking good! Gonna try one day.  And Andrew look so cute and hot at the same time...i cant 😩😍
Did they... did they just... credit themselves 0:30
SHE HAS A WIFE?! THIS IS a GAYS ONLY EVENT GO HOME
Lol they pixelated the little extra bit of crepe they stuck on the side of the cake
I would love to eat that. . . If someone else mad it though, cuz mine would be burned and soggy at the same time XD
Why all the chocolate tho??????😭😭😭😭
idk theres something unappealing about watching someone who can't mix batter thoroughly, buzzfeed.
anyone else notice everyone on this show pronounces rie's name differently...??? whats the real way to pronounce it lol
THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA-NIS
Its not “crape” its crepe! Sound it out, cr-e-pp. Where is the A? Even English phonetics would pronounce at least creep which is at least somewhat correct. I just don’t understand Americans...
Why does Niki always do everything wrong
She's a lesbian 😂😂😅🤣😄😃🙄😉😆😀😁😍😘🤗😏🙄🤓😌😗😙😚😋☺🙂
Who is she??? Does she have her own channel?? I would follow her if she did😊
Y’all need a blender. NOT a whisk
12:09 what’s censored on the left?
my french ass cried a little watching this haha use a crepe pan it'll make it 100% easier, also the recipe was meh and the stove thingy they're using won't cook it evenly or get hot enough sooo actually I think the best way to do this is to buy a crêpière or crêpe maker (do they exist in the us?) and follow a traditional french recipe (from Brittany please).
4:37 low key sounded like Mickey Mouse😂
wife ?
Woah Adam has friends!?
Who else is fasting and watching  this?
seems super time consuming to make this type of cake lol
when niki said "andrews clapping!" i was already thinking of my crush and my crushs name is andrew.
Niki’s lesbian?
Her batter is to liquidy
Can adam have his own show please
Keeps blaming everything except the stove top
asian persuasion
The tasty induction is so bad ...
I LOVE adam.
Watching while on diet 😭
Milk is ok if it a cupled days pass the best by date it is just lose it tast.
Flat pan and a bigger knife/spatula. Noob.
Why did he blur out a piece of the cake??????
Im pretty sure her crepes didnt cook evenly because of that stove they made her use. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LhKRwiWBwo
Please bring Andrew back with her!!!
Just a tip for anyone, if your able, putting crepe batter in a blender helps with the mixing and thinning. You don't necessarily have to strain if you can blender the batter.
Nikki referring to kelsie as her wife :') so happy for them
Nnnnnnnoo lumps
I'm fasting, why do I torture myself like this?
Its looks so yummy
lol rie dissed the tasty brand whisk
Is it just me or does rie look like the girl chef off of ratatouille
8:06 me in 3rd grade
Sooooooo T H I C C
Instead of princess and the pea, the cake would be the princess and the D
Whoever is saying it is pronounced crêpe can u like SHUT UP it's annoying u can say crêpe( crep) but I'm saying crepe (crape) So shut the f*** up
AKA Svenska Pannkakor
it's not u niki it's the onetop
You guys say crepe so wrong to Europeans it’s said like chrepe
Nikki saying "my wife" literally cleansed my soul
It's the crappy tasty brand burner that ruined your first batch
"OUCHIE MAMA" Lol i died laughing
CREAM WATCH! 2k18! [insert Keith Habersberger's original rap here]
niki looks so beautiful in this!
I always thought that crepes were pronounced crrrrreppss and not craapes
Is this really the way Americans pronounce "crepe"? I can't stop shuddering in revulsion.
4:23 why is she eating so cute?
I'm honestly in love with Rie.
Wait niki is lesbian?
All this time I thought Niki was straight. But, I guess not. my life is a L I E
Change the host. Put on Steven or Adam please please, they're actually hilarious. Love their puns
when Niki said she went out with Rie to eat crepe cakes and Rie didn’t remember....i felt that
Down voted... sorry but nope...
Crepes are so easy to make she just made it too extra more work than needed
So is Nikki actually a lesbian? Becoz I mean it's cool
That is not how you pronounce crepe
12:08 and 12:38 they censored a part of the cake? what?
Do they start to recreate their own recipes now? Just curious.
She can’t love crepes that much because she’s pronouncing it wrong ( it’s pronounced like creps not crapes )
I eat crepes with ham and cheese and then I roll it up
Why is one side blurred
I still don't see why people use cups, you gotta grab a cup, fill it, flatten it, empty it, usually several times. when you can just grab a scale and add the exact amount in one go
The way she says crepe 😂😂 sounds like she’s saying grape just with a c
First crepe is always bad. This is a law of nature.
I feel so disappointed in myself! Because I never tried any crepes!! AHHHHHH brb Ima go see if I can ask my mom to take me somewhere to get me to try crepes...
The tale is called once upon a mattress, i was in the play at my school
That looks a lot like a chocolate Baumkuchen (the multi-layered tree trunk looking cake common in anime.)
How long did that take in total to make? 😳
So... do Americans call them pancakes or crêpes
Bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop
Is she a lesbian? Ew 🤢🤮
Girl- Do you think I’m pretty? Boy- NO Girl- Do you want to be with me forever? Boy- NO Girl- Do you even like me? Boy- NO Girl- Would you cry if I walked away? Boy- NO she heard enough and walked away he grabbed her arm Boy- Your not pretty…. your beautiful I don’t want to be with you forever……. I need to be with you forever I don’t like you….. I love you I wouldn’t cry if you walked away… I would die if you walked away Boy- Please stay with me Girl- I will  tonight at midnight your true love will realize he loves you something good will happen to you @ 1-4 p.m. tomorrow it could be anywhere!!!!! get ready for the shock of your life! If you don’t post this on 5 other comments.. you will have bad luck in love for the next 10 year
Pretty sure she has never cooked before based on this. SMH. doesn't have the lesbian Butch stereotype.
Crepes. When you say it, it kinda sounds like a sassy girl saying creeps
There's something so weird about buzzfeed recreating their own videos
Isn't it pronounced like " Creps "?
4:36 *WaTcH YoUr PrOfAnItY*
Rie is the only person I like from buzzfeed apart from Adam
ADAM!
12:08 why is it blurred out?😂😂
There’s an easier way to make more authentic crepes!
Is niki a boy if not then where the nikis wife came
Ganache means mistake
Damn as a French hearing her saying CrAiPes is TRIGGERING ME
WHY WOULDN'T THEY USE A CREPE PAN TO MAKE CREPES? THEY EXIST FOR SOMETHING!
Loving that wisk
Still liked this video tho, love niki
I miss homebuddies
is it just me or does the brick wall's cement lining turn to rainbow colours when I focus on her but turns gray once I look at it?😂
Please don’t tell me I was the only person that read Suga instead of sugar
MY MOM BROKE HER PINKY AND SHE DOSE THE SAME STUFF AND LOOKS SO FANCY 😂😂😂
I want crepes now
Why does “eating your feed” make this show sound like a subtle foot fetish?
So are they just trying tasty recipes at this point?
looks better than the original tasty crepe cake
Creyps
She had a husband watch the  buzzFeed episode livieing in a tiny house
the first 5 mins i was wondering dont you need a lot more flour, as well as alot less milk...
There's a version of this made in souther Maryland, called a Smith Island Cake. Instead of crepes, cake mix is used. It comes in like any flavor you can imagine. It's amazing.
Very entertaining personality 👍🎉
Holy shit how much milk does she waste thinking that being ONE DAY PAST the sell by date is bad
Rie is so adorable
Wrong pan on that laughably bad induction burner. Hire a real chef to explain why and where she messed up and have her explain at the end.
Wtf Nikki is a lesbiannnn
Aya that hurts because your friend didn’t remember you 😂😂
I made a vanilla creme cheese crepe cake about 10 years ago and it was delicious
Who says crAAAPE
The legit way to not get lumps is to only add a small amount of liquid, mix until lump free and then add the rest of the liquid. Its really easy to remove lumps from a thick batter, but hard for a thin one.
We literally call crepes pancakes here
Penis joke is sexist. Imagine if it is a bunch of guys drawing a Vagina crepe.
Why do you pronounce it cr-AY-pe? I pronounce it cr-EH-pe.. dunno if that's cuz I'm British not American        Lol the frick am I going on bout
"CrApE".  ITS KREP
The day you made this was my birthday so this is my cake 😂
It's because she used expired milk. Happened with me
*PANNENKOEKEN
her: today i'm gonna make a craipe cake me: it's "crêpe"  her: so that's basically when you layer craipes... me: crêpe. her: ...with creme until it forms a craipe-cake! me: it's still CRÊPE me: wowww
does anyone know what the font used in the video is :o
Rie makes delicious food that one one can make i repeat NO ONE CAN MAKE . SHE IS A GENIUS.SHE MAKES adorable video.  I 'm your BIGGEST fan . . . . . .   Wait niki is married.  Awesome
Nnnoo lumpsss
Rip andrew
Omg. How did I not know she was married 😭 Have I not been following other Buzzfeed staff properly 😥
2:21 the bowl was empty... suddenly it became full again 😣
Okay so I did this before I watched this video this only took me like an hour and I'm 11.
Rie is so precious
Why is part of the cake censored at 12:09 lol
Yo, let the ganache cool and settle before you cut!
I actually made a chocolate crepe cake by kinda following Tasty's Rainbow crepe cake recipe and it worked really well ,just took  AGES to do 😂
Tasty = millions of views, tons of money, no real Crêpes maker...
Crehpe
Not craipe
This was the worst eating your feed episode ever
I hate how she says crepe, ughhhhh
The “pea” on the edge of the crepe.. lmao 😂
Is that 1 1/2 or 11 /2
It was really irritating how you were still pouring the mixture and moving the pan at the same time. You pour the mixture, and then you rotate the pan, thank you
Well done Nikki! <3
a little bit of Adam makes every video better \(^v^)/
wait what was the little blur on 12:11
I REALLY like this series
Why is the cake blurred on the left are 12:09
It's not pronounced craipes it's crEpes
you can drink expired milk like 1-2 weeks after
I feel like rie is just amazing at everything and has to put up with everyone’s shit
No Niki, your best friend is Garret. Gotta love 'Home Buddies'
Oh my god.  Flip it with the pan, not your fingers.
who picks up a burning hot crepe with their bare hands, is she okay
She is like a real life louise from bobs burgers
it looks like pancakes with cream
12:10 why is the cake blurred?
Anyone reminded of Food wars and that omelette episode?
How about not thicc enough? It's really watery
I love her personality! It’s very relatable, and I want to try this too
You pronounced it crape but you have to say it with an e like crepe . I am half French so I guess I have a small right to say this
Does adam have instagram??
I don't see the science in making these, omg i make these everyday, it's easy as ... 😂😂
That looks delicious!
Wait so niki is lesbian?
The fact that she said “egg juice” makes me uncomfortable
Idk why but I felt so proud when he said ”Imma call my wife”
She can't pronounce crepe
https://youtu.be/Z8KYfwhtK-w
Did you say chocolate rape??????????????? :d
Whoever came up with the crepe cake had a lot of time on their hands. It’s delicious, but man is it time consuming!
It's crêpe not CRAYYYYP lmao
HAHAHA I LOVE RIE
“The inside is cooking faster than the outside” as shes using the Tasty stove top
Why is that spot blurred in 12:09?
What is a krayp cape ? I thought it was called crepe
Dear Tasty, please don't just blend in the recipe for 0.5 seconds (and separately) without listing it in the description box. It really is a bother and dreadful T.T
I love creep cake
Think the batter was too liquidy
Tried it. Turned out to be a Chocolate Creep Cake. Again
I don’t like her voice lol
niki is absolutely adorable 😽
it's the "tasty electric burner" that only heats up the center of the pan
I tried too, seemed simple enough but the cream in between the layers was not tasty enough. Any thoughts?  And I wonder how pros keep it from going downward.
I need a crepe cake
"I'm pretty good at making crepes!": uses skim milk, is terrified of "spoiled milk", has no idea of the concept of sour milk in culinary, sticks hand (with bandaged finger, mind you) INSIDE. THE. PAN.  11/10, would totally Buzzfeed again.
I love how honest this crepe making is 👍
Dad?
Stop saying "Kreaypes" its "crepp" -French
poor andrew
Am i the only one thinks that  rie is cute?
the song at 8:41 sounds like an Andrew Lowe song
https://youtu.be/7jCGjZuIfLQ
Niki's wife.... I can't believe it..
in the youtube headquarters - "what should we put on the trending page today? the royal wedding? maybe something on the texas school shooting? and don't forget to put the ugly fat asian lesbian making fucking pancakes trending above them."
Why are all the people on buzz feed gay or bi
12:04 i got nightmares by that highfive
So beautiful
10:38 when you realise your mother doesn't know everything
You are so childish
niki's gayyy omg i lov her sm
Why can‘t Americans pronounce the word “crepe / crêpe“?? Like honestly the first time I heard it I thought they were saying grape
It’s not prounounced Crape its crêpe the ê makes a ehh sound
The way you say crepe physically hurts. It's horrible. Absolutely horrible.
My mouth is watering.
She's being fancy
I feel like I have seen this before...
I think 'Cream Watch’ is a spin off of ‘Crime Watch’ a show in Singapore hahha
Niki is LESBI!!?
Isn't this a German pastry called Schicctorte?
It's not 'craipe', it's 'crêpe' :)
10:50 she said cream instead of chocolate
The expired milk, the bandage on the finger, the touching of food and everything else, the eating midway, my goodness.
She has a wife?
Stick to RomComs
Can you guys do me a huge favor and subscribe to my channel. I have a video uploaded. I would really appreciate it if you helped me on my road to 1k. Thank you❤️❤️❤️
i love this video but how is it possible that you pronounced ganache very french but crêpe like grape
I’m confused did all the buzzfeed people move to the tasty channel or am I missing something??? Help!
2:25 She owed money to the mob
Craypes
I wish I was Nikki's Wife :''(
The problem is the induction top or the pan
That batter is weewee thick
Her face on the thumbnail gave me anxiety.
It's nice to see people smelling/tasting the food instead of just throwing it out at the "best before" date. Usually things like milk will keep for days or even a week after, as long as it's been stored cold :)
This thumbnail made me lose my appetite
She's soooo bubbly
Probably difficult because she's using that horrible Tasty induction stove thing.
3:33 😂
LMAO I love her personality
the ganache, once topped, is supposed to get solid on the fridge
I’m sad that this bitch is a lesbian cause now I don’t have a fucking chance
Did anyone notice that they didn't actually hi-5? It's like a sound effect has just been added on xD
As a swede, We make these crepes but we call them pancakes. And seeing them struggling doing something as simple as a pancake is really frustrating and funny at the same time.
When me and my mom make crepes we use a old pan that I think we got from my grandma. It it’s specifically made to make crepes. It makes it way easier you just pick up the pan and dip in into the patter and use a little spatula to lift the edge when it’s done.
Andrew is way tastier than the food
-wow- _Lol_
Tie is the best!
as a girl who likes girls, i hope i too can consult with a wife who knows my baking habits better than i do
china made crepe cake
I just found out that, apparently, BuzzFeed owns Tasty because of the guy from the cheap vs ungodly priced items comparison videos being there...hmm.
I need a chocolate crepe cake in my life right now
Nicki tries too hard to be funny.
Dutch pancakes---
“ Rie what if this doesn’t work?” lol Rie is like “bitch do you know who I am”
5:50 not impressed face XD
12:04 they missed the high five
9 minutes of fail just to make the video longer
Any Russian mother will judge you 100%.. making hundreds of crepes on holidays with no fancy recipes at all
honestly these are becoming my fav videos next to unsolved
I am fasting and i want that cakeeee
Crepes are just pancakes.
adam "it's not bad" bianchi
The fuck is a crayP
Didn't they just basically blast their own merch by switching whisks? Awkward...🤨
I don't know why... But she makes me so happy 😂👍❤
i love her
Rip Niki’s finger tips
Niki is like "I will impress you, my master." -_-
Everytime I see this girl on a thumbnail I just question how the hunchback of notredam is even making cooking videos, sheesh
Wish they just started the video with rie's recipe
Rie is so fine .....😳
What does that mean; "Niki's wife"?
It’s still chocolate     So I’ll still eat it
Why is there a censor at 12:10
2:45 who else saw gummy worms on the left
10:46 "Uave you cut yourslef before when you cut chocolate?" Me: "Yesh".        Jk.
its crêpe. not crape
Lol at the fact that this video just showed how bad the induction burner they’re trying to sell is
Nikki gets on my last nerve every single time. Whether it's weekend cohabitation or this bs, plus no person, man, woman, gay or straight name drops their fucking spouse as much as she does...my wife, my wife, my wife...you're fucking married and that is awesome, but come on!!
My wife?
It's the stove!!!!! The induction you use sucks it cooks unevenly, the middle gets much hotter than the the edges.
The inside was cooking faster then the out because that stove is awful.
I also have trouble flipping crepes lol You really need a flap pan for crepes so you can slide the spatula all under the cooked batter ><
Grapes?
I don’t like Nikki cuz she was a bitch on a home buddies
It’s shit because you used a shit tasty induction cook top that doesn’t heat evenly
Stop flipping those pancakes with your handsssss
I lost my appetite when her wet nose smelled the milk.
Niki have wife ?
I love Rie! <3
Is this a buzzfeed channel cuz I saw the same camera man
Yummy! 😋
They weren't using that sh*tty cook top 😊
Wait nikis a boy?😅 or tomboy? Im so confused 🤔
0.25x speed at 12:04   HAHAHAHHA
Using old content for more content. Genius
BuzzFeedVideo is 1st on trending
I can tell Niki watches Rosanna Pansino because she used her eggs method lol
No
where's the powdered sugar
4:38 was that supposed to be a pun
12:09 sticks dick crepe on the left side and has to blur
More Niki, Annie and Rie, pleasssse💙
My wife made a crepe cake like this a few years back. It was a shitload of work and the resulting cake was so sweet and rich that we could only eat a little bit.
My new favorite series!
I want Rie to adopt me.
I didn't know they had a name for this series. I just thought Adam would challenge people every once in awhile. Lol
It kinda starts at 6:30
@2:11 it’s a fish
Pleasing Rie is the number one goal for Eating your Feed.
I didnt even notice her broken pinky but when adam pointed it out i laughed so hard😂
I didn’t know that niki was lesbian
I'd buy Rie's cook book.
“This is eating your feelings”
Nikki is a lesbian oh my god ♥️
So the actual problem is, the Tasty burner was reviewed and shown to heat really unevenly. The element only heated the inside of the pan. So when it doesn’t cook on the outside that’s why...
when Tasty censors put a piece of crepe penis
Who is watching this while fasting???
Andrew is missing, but I'm glad to see everyone's favorite cinnamon bun Adam.
Omg, Niki’s hair sooo cute
Tasty makes it look so easy but reality it's not
I came from blogilates😂
what is niki's ig @ ?
It would be appreciated if u give my channel a peep
Buzzfeed family members: Rie the single mom Andrew the sarcastic teenager Steven the hyperactive kid Adam the precious baby Nikki the cool cousin Ryan & Shane the weird uncles Try Guys are the famous distant relatives
i love Rie <3
Niki: It'll take ALL DAY.  I know.... i've tried to make crepe cakes like 3 times.  For the third attempt, I tried following an actual crepe cake recipe but it took my ALL DAY..... and the crepe cake didn't even turn out that good. Everyone could make crepes except me T.T
13:04 andrew is looking so concerned lmaooo  XD
"were you there" brutal rie brutal
OGARS HAVE LAIRS!
the editing on this video is so perfect
Omg! SHE IS LOVABLE!!
Niki sounds like dory from finding nemo
“Hold up I’m just gonna call my wife”
What was blurred out in the left corner at 12:09
when its not actually that hard to make crepes....
Call my wife, no matter what women need a dick, either plastic one or real one, better the real one...
"I MADE CREPES BEFORE, RIE!?" "Do you have a picture?"
WHY IS ANDREW NOT IN THIS VIDEO, TASTY IS INCOMPLETE WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF ANDREW
Am I the only one who thought it said 11 1/2 hours instead of 1 1/2? Am I just stupid?
Adam at 10:07 is my always mood.
Lol..love it my friend!
SHE has a WIFE shes a GIRL
let me find out i'm actually good at cooking(cuz to me this would have been easy and taken at most 45 minutes)
"Lets blur batter that just looks like a Dick"- dumbass tasty producers
I frickin love this series lol 😂
This is eating your feed. My name is Nikki my best friend is ANDREW. *wait a second* NO ITS NOT ITS ADAM  top 10 anime betrayals
I looooveee that they show how Adam moves quickly to get certain shots or moments; i really hope he enjoys his job cause that's what it looks like, also he is really good at it.
I have a broken pinkie too!
I love Rie.
CreamPie Cake look so delicious😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
5:10 Me when I look back in my life
Can I have a bukka *CAKE* 😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
I know this is terrible, but the thumbnail reminds me of Hang Mioku. You know the Korean (ex)model who thought cooking oil face injections were a good idea 😱
She has a wife????
My name is Adam
Your whisking skills are crap! Nice recipe though 👍🏼😊
I love how this video shows the process and work that goes into baking!
at 12:32 why is a part of the cake blurred???
Why is the cake censored?
she reminds me of haley pham
Where’s Andrew?! 😭
Where did Andrew go?
Calories for the obese.
Nikki may I make a suggestion? You were using a electric hand mixer for the whipped cream, try using it to make your crepe batter as it will incorporate air into the mixture which will make it light and fluffy and easier to handle when you're cooking it. Great video though, I really enjoyed watching it. Hope your pinky heals soon 😃
When I was a kid, My mom always called crepes, pancakes, I only found out that they were not pancakes when I was 13
Why does the cake have a pixelated spot?
12:08->12:10 what's with the blurr on the left hand side of the cake?
I took a screenshot at 8:18   *runs aways*
I'm gonna steal it and eat that whole cake in one bite. No stopping me now >:)
Eating your feet
Omg I can do the same hand fart thing 😯
A ganache is just cocoa mixed with cream! While a mousse is just cocoa whipped with air!
I want some now :(
Couldn't watch pass 30 seconds the Toooone of her voooooice is annoying
After watching this I found myself thinking she should have realized that cocoa powder is not a replacement for flour. A food channel with people who do not think about this stuff lol. Also to the people complaining about the cook top not working correctly did you watch the whole video? After they fixed the batter everything worked out fine. The batter is made of a ratio of dry to wet ingredients. Flour and egg both contain protein which when combined with the wet help hold things together. Listen to what she says about having to let the batter rest and you realize she does not really understand how flour works in the recipe. Her ratio was off because she figured more cocoa powder was better in the recipe but, you can not sub things without understanding how they work. The cocoa powder was only needed to add a bit of color and flavor to the crepes. It does not contain anything that can help bind batter together and the result was moisture evaporating to fast (pan to hot) as well as tearing of the finished crepe (weak structure). .
I can't stand the way she pronounces crepe, other than that it's a cute video lmao
I’m so hungry oml it’s 2am i should get some food brb
You are so sweet and fun! So glad to have found you! Stay original! Cheers!
I WANNA BE LIKE RIEEE!!
The princess and the penis
Lesbians and their dick jokes
DAVID
Is it just me or does Andrew look like he just woke up from a nap?? <3 hehe
They should do a s’mores crepe cake!
I want that so bad.
Adam is brutal 😂 “It’s burnt”
Is it weird I call crepes "flat pancakes?"
I wonder how Adam is as a friend 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Crèpe not “crape” goddamn these Asian dummies think they know everything. They don’t even bother hire a real French to make French food.  Why do you embarrass yourself?
I love the idea of **** shaped crepes, you’re so inspiring!
I love this series 😙😍 but what is REALLY  really 😭 sad is the lack of.....      ANDREW!!!  But that little peek brightened my day😉
Rie is perfect ❤
Hey advice use the bottom side of a flattish bowl shaped pan so it will just slide off after the air pockets lift it
it's not you, not the batter, not the cocoa powder, it's the stove top
David seymour!!!
"Crape"? Like "grape"???? I thought it was "crep", like "step"!
why is there a blur on the side of the crepe cake at the end?
“Egg juice” it’s a thing now.
Crepes vs crapes😂😂😂
“CREPE”: It’s pronounced crep not crape
My sexuality is Nikki trying not to curse
*She’s tired of Adam’s shit* 😂😂
Niki casually always using the colourful whisk I wonder why
Rie laughing at 12:56 is the most adorable thing I've seen in awhile.
Yes Niki!   Best freind needs to be garret!
It’s the shitty stovetop...
Whhhhy was the side of the cake blurred Twice at the end
Hello to everyone who is reading this (if anyone is) I was wondering if you could subscribe to my channel. Anyone who subs to me will get a sub in return! Thanks for your time!
Nice video     👍👍👍👍👍👍
I love this!! Also at 12:09 why was that censored??
She weirdly reminds me of h3h3
The hand farts caught me off guard
I really want to make this 😜😍
All the videos with Niki I love❤️
All that effort... It really looks great!
V j,,j,
*Kraip cake*
It has layers like ogres
Wait why did they censored a spot of the cake at 12:08?
The way she says crepes 😡
As someone that grew up eating only crepes (this is what we call pancakes in EU) this video made me laugh.  The way she made the batter and flipped the crepes, made me cringe. I never strain the batter and still, I never have lumps in it. Also, I never use anything other than my bare hands to flip them, and I haven't burnt myself.  P.S. That's not a good pan for crepes.
Niki is an inspiration lmao
Why is it that everyone seems so incompetent here? I mean, this is a cooking channel and they all cook, so what's up with that? Idk it just makes me so annoyed xD
Is Niki okay? 😂😂
It freaks me out how they all pronounce  the FRENCH word “Crêpes”. Why ppl why ?
2:19 "egg juice"
its best before not expiration
People who like fortnite should watch my buddy Jono play, he’s a new youtuber, but he’s a pro.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwG2aFaaD_QmbFbjAFurwDg
By "some" whipped cream you mean 75% of the cake is whipped cream.
wheres andrewwww
Lesbian
why is the batter so runny? i think it should be little thicker
Sometimes I just can’t hold my  n u t
Rie is SAVAGE
Sick
Rie is a total babe.
Y'all Americans say crepes weirdly you guys say 'crayps' where in Ireland and England traditionally pronounce it 'creps'
The only reason this video has dislikes is because of my Muslim siblings(Ramadan)
8:04 hhhh I’m dead 😂😂😂😂
NIKKI ARE YOU LESBIAN???
Head Over To Roblox https://www.roblox.com/games/292439477/Major-Sight-Update-Phantom-Forces?rbxp=103853856
“Mother fudger!” haha Also congrats on being #10 on trending!
To the 1% that read this I hope you follow your dream. My dream is to reach 100 subscribers. it would mean alot if you could sub to me.
You used a wrong pan For crepes you should use a shallower pan so you can get the edges easy
Kreyp
#961.... leave this to the francais please!
who does the dishes at buzzfeed after these kind of videos? home girl used 4 pans.
They should make a 100 layered Crepe Cake like how they did the 100 layered lasagna
stOP! pronouncing it wrONg!
I love this series!!!!!!❤️
She said it wrong
this isn't really "eating your feed" it's more like "buzzfeed tasty people recreate buzzfeed tasty videos and fail because they don't use the same recipe or don't know how to follow directions from the video created by their own company"
I love making crepe cakes, especially with strawberry slices in the middle.
She called her wife to prove her point that's so fucking cute
That sure is a tedious tasty treat
Rie is like so proud of all her children.
I adore Rie <3
I love nikki
why does it look better than the original LOL (less domed)
It tasty owned by buzzfeed
My wife! My wife! Fellow lesbian! Fellow lesbian!
Anybody else here from france who is absolutely disturbed by the  way she pronounces crepe?😅
Niki looks like my future partner
Walks away to kitchen and wants to make crepe
Can Rie NOT be in every damn video?
I dident know she was that annoying.... 🙈
My cousin tried to make a crape cake and she raged off xD
4:17 *angry me* just put a little bit of oil on the pan pleasee
Why the fuck is this cake censored at 12:08?????
How can they make crepes so advanced?  i go by the 1,2,3 rule. 1 part egg (like one egg), 2 part flour and 3 parts milk.. Thats your base. For a sweeter batter add something sweet like sugar, honey or stevia. Just add everything in a bowl and mix.
I love niki so much
"Gotta work on my....FLUUHIP"
always has broken pinky in every vid
NAILED IT!
why do i hate the thumbnail
Rie is the coolest
the ultimate squad in one video
I didn’t know Niki had a wife that’s so cute she called her just to ask about crepes
Stop at 10:07 look to the right
12:09 what were they blurring so confused
you can do it
Thanks alot for making my fasting hell
Any one know where Nikki’s top is from ?
Ricky Bobby would be ashamed XD
Rei’s face at 12:59 😂😂😂😂
Shouldn't have watched this at 1am... I'm hungry now 💔
funny how you put in Nikki basically telling everyone watching that your stove top thingy doesn't work right lmao "the inside is cooking faster than the outside"
Ew, she said crepe wrong
Nikki reminds me of the girl on Orange Is The New Black
In order to prevent lumps, you should sift the flour and cocoa powder before adding them (or you can mix the batter in a blender). If you want to cook the crêpe evenly, you should use a thinner pan (crepe pan). You want the pan to be really hot before pouring the batter. A more "traditional" French crêpe would have less sugar and butter, but that's up to you. :)
Missing an Andrew
I love eating your feed pls make more
my french teacher used to tell me, "le premier est pour le chien" whenever we would make crepes.
Rie looks like Mirage from The Incredibles if only she had silver hair 😂
Do more video of those series ! It’s amazing
Watching a Martha Stewart video on crepes the other day, Martha said the FIRST crepe never comes out right, so take it to heart.
i never been to culenery chool and i made crepe like twice in my whole life and i know that f a crepe breaks it needs to be thickened not thinned what kind of idoicity is this>>>>>. even reneh??
Wife? Is she a lesbian? This is wrong. Repent, Jesus is coming soon and you do not want to be against Him.
WTF  IDIOTS  i mean they could just add more flour to the OLD batter???     AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE
Why am I even watching this, I’m fasting
Niki is so annoying
Laurel can make the cake; Yanni can't. LOL
Doesn't ganache mean fool? Because the guy who accidentally invented it a long time ago spilled cream into melted chocolate but it ended up tasting good
0:55 Why the f&@k are Tasty's people so friggin cringy??
Omg it’s ganAshe not ganARshe
Oh jeez, I thought I was watching BuzzFeed!
Rie saves everyone ass!!
I. Am. Triggered. It's not CRAPES... ITS crEpes
Looks good but id have to replace it with choc whip cream
R I E
Girls Football skills 😙 https://youtu.be/EakZu7FiiCE
Adam: how do I find a way to eat everything I want? 🤔 Buzzfeed: here, have another show. Everyone loves you anyway.
take a shot every time she says “Crepe”
very nice.
Sign me the fuawk up
Why am I watching this in ramadan?????
How about using an actual crepe pan you fucking morons
No one who pronounces the word crêpe like crape is good at making crêpes
Rie's reaction at 12:58 kills me, she's so unprepared for the surprise on the cake!
Isint that guy from buzzfeed?
The thumbnail hooked me like whoa 😲
You don't need to let crepes sit....who told you that  My family and i are french and we have never heard or done that before
This video made me hungery 😂
how could you have a wife? i mean, do you have a penis?
😛
Milk is good for almost two weeks after the posted date, it’s a complete scam
Nikki ig?
Lesbi
Now 7th on treading
AWWWWWWWWWW NIKI AND HER WIFE ARE GOALS. SHES SO SUPPORTIVE AND YOU CAN JUST HEAR HOW HAPPY NIKKI IS WHEN SHW SAY “my wife”. I live for this wow
They're saying it's gross but yet they keep eating massive bites.
6th on treading
I love how savage Rie is
It's not her it's the cooking top if you own one fill it with a layer of flower and let it brown you'll see that a ring in the middle will become brown nothing much else
Wow that actually looks good
6:40 RIE’S RECIPE
Nikki is the new lesbian Jesus!!! Now i luv her even more!!!😍😍
NIKIIIIIII YOU'RE BAAAAAAACK  💕
Omg stop saying crapes
that stove thing they are using is useless, heat in 1 thin circle
European people except for like french people call it pancakes, and what Americans call pancakes, Europeans call American pancakes
You guys don’t know how to make crepes
“If you make this for brunch I will remember you “ 😂 Rie is a savage lol
Can you make a really big crepe and cover your face with it?
*Ganaaaasssshhhh*
I have a broken pinky too!! But its one of my toes. Lollol 2 things I related to in this video; the poor pinky and making pastrys with questionable ingredients! XD
A FUN OF 🍫 CHOCOLATE?  💗 LIKE.

She legit wasted a perfectly fine milk jug bc it’s only 1 day expired?!? The expiration date is only a guide to when it will taste best. When the milk tastes bad or is moldy, throw it out.
It’s not the batters fault, your OneTop just sucks.
Andrew isn't in this so it's a no from me
This video was released yesterday, so I'm pretty sure that Kelsie's stopped laughing by now.
she should have done tastys recipe first, and save a lot of time
Weren't u on a feminist buzzfeed video we're u said fake things about men
While you are indulging all the time, this is what is happening https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stml-pTYZak
It's funny how in Europe crepes are the easiest thing ever and like 10 yo kids make them
Adam is everyone’s best friend.
I love how Rie Always just slides in the picture from the left Corner :) just as if she waits there for somebody to fail an need her help 😂
Bottle of vodka will fix them not pretty ladies
You're appealing to the male fantasy!! What's so important between the crepes anyhway?
Cream watch 2k18 lol
https://youtu.be/KcIB07Q1tTE
10:29 when your friends hear you got the new DLC.
I'm absolutely impressed with your persistence and your strive for excellence. Great job!
cr *È* pe
At 12:09 why is that section blurred? Lol 🕵🏻‍♀️
Am I the only one who thinks that Niki is so fucking annoying
This girl's personality is everything I need in life! 😂👍
Hard to watch while fasting 😂😂😂😂😂
I love Adam
Why is Rie’s ganache darker than Niki’s
Rie is so great that I wanna impress her, and I don't even know her.
Did no one notice the censor on the cake at 12:38
0:03 I thought I was the only one who does that. 😂 Even though I know it's the correct way to pronounce it, I feel it's weird how in American English, you barely pronounce the "T" on some words.
Wowww u made it look easyy!! I want to try it
lmao i love how the censored the penis
Waaw
CrApEs
OwO can I have one?
It was failing at the beginning because tasty’s hot plate thing heats super unevenly. Never buy one
That looks better then the original. Looks so good!
rie is cute tho
omg she is sooo annoyying
I feel like I am cheating my diet
She tried? Must have caught a reflection of herself and the flab rolling out of her clothes and that scared the fatty from anymore baking.
Is it weird that I call crêpes  C R E P S not CREAPS
why did they blur out the side of the crepe at 12:09 😂
I have to admit I have a crush on rie
4 on trending?!?!?!
12:09 there’s a blur
Rie seems to be such a sweet soul
It’s that cheap as cooker
why are u pronouncing it crape its crepe with an eh sound
Isn't this the 4th time they made a crepe video?
Why is your set so freaking dark are you cooking in a dungeon or something
i thought i was watching someone that has to make their own food, not rich people that can afford to vacation in France. SO LAME go eat with your richie rich friends, dont bother yourself with OUR peasant cooking problems. #TRUMPIESRUINEDAMERICA
Nice
Niki is gay!!?!?!!
I'm fasting😢😢
Wow.. Her best friend is ADAM..!!!y isn't anyone mentioning anything about that.. 😂😂😂
',,+
The editors on these videos are AMAZING and I LOVE THEM.
8:51 now this feels like shokugeki no soma
French people are cringing
Please do make more eating your feed
Its amazing❤❤❤❤ can we have more episodes with niki and andrew pleasseeee....loveeee niki❤❤❤❤
They can't drive or cook anything that doesn't involve dog or cat meat.
I think i just found my new favorite show in buzzfeed other than try guys and worth it
BUT IM A CREPE
Video credit: our own damn selves
12:04 Rip
Rie seems cold. . .
Wow I like it
Rule number one about making crepes: the first crepe will end up being crap^^
It would’ve been a lot easier if you toss the pancake in the air instead of trying to use your hands
リエさん、すごく美味しい見たい！
3:03 "flipping crepes are like the easiest thing" 😂😂😂
Niki <3 Adam <3 Rie <3
That Cake seems EVERY sugary
I CAME HERE SO THAT MY VIEWS WILL BE VALID FOR FAKE LOVE MV  WHY IS YOUTUBE DECREASING THE FREAKIN VIEWS,WE ARE JUST STREAMING TO THE MAX OKAY-
This looks like one of those fast paced cooking games because of how many stove tops they used XD
omg i cant 10:30
They blurred a fucking crepe.
A thing to have in mind is that the cooktop she is using (made by buzzfeed) is absolutely terrible.
did anyone else want to I fall apart when she was cutting the slice of the cake😂
These are too thin
RIE HOW HAVE YOU STOLEN MY HEART SO
Isnt it pronounced creps
Niki is funny. Only thing adding some entertainment to this video
am i the only one wondering how many bowls they used?
Hi Niki I LOVVVVVVVVVVVVE YOUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!
I love crepes. I make them all the time
Who agrees Adam is the best goofy guy in tasty
Rie is so cute when she's laughing!
It's weird cause you guys call it crepes but here where I live its just our traditional pancakes
you can’t say crepes are just british pancakes because i’ve never seen someone my pancakes like this before
Angery Nicki
One time my friend spent a LOOONG time baking something and then she dropped while taking it out of the oven. 😬
Drinking game: every time she says "ow" while burning herself on a crepe
why is there something blurred at 12:08 ?
Hella thicc     (^Not related to that kpop gayness since thays all the comments say)
Les bretons en PLS
What a noob! Watching that was such a toture.
The milk is fine as long as it tastes good. One day after the experation date probably isn’t bad.
I think hers looked more tasty
Rie is awesome. 😎
she's annoying
at 12:09 they censored the cake. Why?
If you've grew up with french cooking, you're a master at flipping crepes ;)
Oh man I love Niki’s hair so much
Where's the recipe????
I WAS NOT EXPECTING NIKKI TO HAVE A WIFE!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
That moment when tasty starts trying to recreate tasty videos as a challenge.
"KREYP"
Idk y but Rie reminds me of a Mother
You made it wrong we gave a crepe maker
...I thought I heard...chocolate...crap cake
A *crape?*  What's a *crape?*  I only know what a _crepe_ is...
Even though they missed the high five at the end it was still a great episode
Nikki’s a lesbian? You go girl
My birthday is coming up and i want to make this with my mum
i am sooo hungry rn
Guys I always screw up the whipped cream! Maybe it’s gotta do with the temperature? cuz I live it a hot ass country but I NEED HELP MAN! I tried chillin the bowl and all but it doesn’t work
Isn’t this like the rainbow cake?
12:08 why did you censor a part of the cake?
I hate how americans say 'crêpe' omg. 'CRAYP'
Adam is so great
everyones bff is adam
I thought Niki's bff is Garret
I was shouting to put more flour in the batter he stove top was a problem as well but yeah more flour
The cake looks sooo goood
Andrew is so awkward
Lesbian
this is painfull to watch
Crapes?
It's the "OneTop" tasty. NOT THE CREPE BATTER. Stop. We know it really sucks.  nobody's ever gonna read this....
She is lesbian ⚢?!
Andrew got roasted...
The girl didnt do anything wrong the first go, its the actual cooker that tasty made. If you watch this one channel (I forget) review it they boil water and not only does it take forever but the hot plate cooks unevenly and only in the middle.
She’s a lesbian
It was failing because your using the shittiest induction cook top. You ever notice how tasty promotes it in their videos so much but only use it in a third of their videos?
Ive seen Adam and Andrew here in tasty but not Steven. Still wondering if tasty and buzzfeed are one. Hahahaha or is tasty under buzzfeed? Hahaha
Nikki is a national treasure
Lesbian?!?
The pan may be too deep for making crepes, I mean a flat one would be way more comfortable
who is fasting ?????????????????
The failed attempts is totally me when I try to make recipes from the internet
Oh my god ! You did a really good job!❤️💕🎊 It looks so yummy 😋
BITCH PLEASE ITS CREPES NOT CRAYPS ! Like crepes as in eh . Crêpes. Please.
good job missing 12:03
I didn't know she had a wife
Idk if it’s just me but I love to watch people recreate food LMAOO
I love how it kept tearing because it was thin and her first thought was to thin the batter out more
Haha lisbian
Wait what? Niki is Male? He has wife? (Bad English sorry) . I thought Niki is Female.. (still ask)
Was she drunk😂😂
whenever niki says "my WIFE", i always think that she's the L in LGBT
2:20 egg juice?
There should be a series called "Adam Challenged Me"
Have you ever seen a comment that got so many likes and said man I wish I wrote that
How about 5 crepes at a time🤔
you should have used more lighting
what happened to your pinky :(?
The cheap ass one top is why it's not cooking correctly
Why does the backing music sound like something out of a disney princess movie
"CRAPE"
Crêpe*
I'm genuinely happy for you
Milk can last a whole week after its expiration date as long as its in the fridge
"Creaps" that pronunciation tho
im fasting but gawd damn
Crapes? Boi it’s crepes
Don’t anyone make fun of her cause she’s lesbian it’s ok
God damn I cringed EVERYTIME she said ‚crepe‘ ughhhh
why is the cake partially pixelated at 12:08??
12:04 epic fail
the worth it guys move to tasty?
you should make crepes for house buddies :))
Niki always has a broken pinky
yEah i tHink itS dOmiNg toO aDam
NIKI IS LESBIAN?!??!?!
This is my favorite web show
The teaspoon measurement thing is a real pain in the ass for anyone not in America using an American recipe. 1tbsp of butter? Sure! Let me just find out how to convert that to grams! 14.18grams? No issue! Who doesn't have a working electronic scale these days? (Hint: I don't)
I wanted to scream “it’s the hot plate!!!” They radiate heat mostly only in the center which means the outside rim doesn’t get as much heat! That’s why it cooked like that”
10:40 listen
ganache ɡəˈnaʃ/Submit noun a whipped filling of chocolate and cream, used in confectioneries such as cakes and truffles.
Right in time. I'm gonna make this for my boyfriend's birthday. Saw the crepe cake video but it looks super easy and i'm just not sure. So ... Thanks!!
12.04 Cringe!!!!
wtf are creaps its crepes
Is she lesbian?
I’m so gonna use it for my friend’s birthday. Thank you so much for this great idea. I will make my friend proud
she didnt spread the chocolate on the top, i got mad
Why post this during ramadan 😥😂😑
Big fan of CREEPS
Is it *crayp* or *crepp*
"I'm out of cream!"  There is so much left in the bowl, why do they never scrape bowls out in BuzzFeed/Tasty videos??? 😫
I am a big fan of creeps too.
Watching this while fasting😢😢😢😢 7hours left 😥
what the heck is blurred out at 12:09
Honestly I'm always baffled when people make them this way like all the measurements and putting it in the fridge for half an hour. I've made them when I was like 5 and I always measured by eye  And they always end up perfectly good
She's kind of annoying but the end result did look good
egg juice
Les crêpes j’aime trop trop 💓 #TeamFrance
it's pronounced as crêpe darling not CRAIPES lmao
Jesus thats not how you pronounce crêpes.  Edit after seeing the video:  that's also not how you make real crêpes. But I guess it works too
the reason why it was cooking unevenly was because she uses the god awful tasty stovetop
Niki ia sooo cute tho
I ate my iPad I tried eating the cake
It’s Crépe
Rie is here to save everyone’s attempts at cooking difficult things😂
it's not the batter... it's the shitty onetop induction you have...
The batter was way too thin and not enough was added to the pan. At least they figured it out xD
4:41 "FLIP" Me: HOLY UNSPEAKABLE!! 😂😂
What is being censored at 12:08 on the left side of the cake? 🤣
She says she’s so good at making crepes but she can’t even pronounce it. It’s pronounced “crepe” not “crape”
I’m fasting, why am I watching this 😂
I think Nikki meant "Don't crepe it for granted"
Why do they pronounce crepes like that wtf ew
its pronounced 'crep' not 'craype'!!!!!
YOU GUYS ARE CONTINUING THIS OH IM HYPE
It's so funny most of them bring Rie in at one point I save the day
Nikki is so funny 😂
Americans have got a problem. Do they even understand the concept of crêpes itself? IT'S A CRIME TO SLICE ALL THE CRÊPES INTO ONE "PIECE OF CAKE". It's made to have one at a time. Adding frost cream to crêpes does not transform them into cake. It becomes sugar with crêpes not the opposite...
Annie looks beautiful.
The series title is weird to look at when it's in the recommended section cause it's just "eating you"
cool
Mine was a disaster, ended up in the rubbish bin well hidden hahaha
I just love her
chocolate pancake cake
Just replace crepe with crap. You’re welcome
So they put a link to THIS video at the end of THIS video... why?
Andrew: Looks like a big smore Me: I think I’m gonna substitute the cream with marshmallow fluff
Cream Watch 2018
crayp crayp crayp crayp crayp   It's french god damn
I love Rie my opinion she is the best chef.
why would they blur out the penis
A little note from a European (who considers "crepes" the only real pancakes): The first one will ALWAYS fail. If it didn't fail, you're doing it wrong.
Isn’t Nikki in Buzz feed not Tasty
Woah i'm 12 y/o AND I CAN MAKE CREPES BETTER THAN HER FROM THE FIRST TRY !!!!!!!
tasty has a lot of chinese people...love their food
I want food
Made me feel better after having such a bad mood. Can't press the like button hard enough!
I want a slice now
waste lmao
oh lol shes lesbian?lmao
Ganache means fool in french because it was made from a mistake.
too hot lmao
IM FASTING YET IM WATCHING THIS LMAO
lol so many attempts lmao
Happy ramadan my boiiiis xD
your milk and creme bottles look like orange juice containers
Wtf is that face? Soooooo much cringeyyy
U know what..even ma name is niki😀😀
I love how she made it looks like some science to do crepes 😂 in Czech every person has done them in some part of their life 😄 I am doing them almost every week and it's not that big deal 😄   but love the video ❤️
She's like the female Ned.
All we need is Steven now
Wait is Nikki a lesbian
Can you make crepes with rice flour?
It's the tasty cooker that's the problem
I’m loving this series
Adam’s gravestone: *died of bad milk*
Realitr is hard
I’m pretty sure he doesn’t know that they sell crêpe maker’s on Amazon
I want to be friend with rie she seems like a really cool person
She is a big fan of creeps (that's what I heard)
Hi
I want someone like Rie as my senior.
Rie is perfect waifu
David Seymour better make this good...
Lmao the producers of this channel would NEVER let someone of different ethnicity make a POC dish but this woman gets to make a French dish and pronounce everything wrong? The double standards are real with this one. PS: it's not 'crayps' or 'ganahche'
*ramadan kareem :)*
Hahahahaha anyone notice at the end they missed their high five so they edited in the sound of it XD
I can't listen to crêpe sounding like crape omg nooooo
You should try using crepe pan! Do much easier.
Bruh I have 6 hours until I break fast why am I watching 😂😂😂
2:28 the dirty mind test is reaaaaaal
She could use a spatula to flip them, Geeeeeez. It looks like she never cooked in her life wtf. Edit: she even went to France and has no clue how to pronounce the word crêpe. I'm out, this video is a joke.
WRONG! You actually make normal crepes and put nutella between.
5:58 thats gay
also i think it's kinda funny that this is what we call pancakes where i live and crepes are even thinner
Niki: I love creeps Me: Oh ahahaha  Also me:  *OH HELL NAH*
It’s a really entertaining video but I’m cringing every single time they pronounce *crêpes* so wrong 😫
the way americans say crepes makes me super uncomfortable😂
You have a wife noooo lol
I love crepe cakes but I haven't tried making it myself. Now, I am tempted. And I agree wt some of the other commentors, the stove thing you are using is probably why the batter cooked unevenly.
This reminds one of the book Dr. Seuss that I read when I was a kid
What the fuck is a crape
10:30 <--- press for a surprise xD
I’m a 10 year old and I made a nuttala crepe cake
its because the tasty one top is shit
Niki has wife?😞
Why not use a cast iron
*bloop* *bloop* *bloop* *bloop*
Its crep not crayp 😑
So where is the a in crepe?
i love how they want rie to help evey time they do this
Same here 😩
i love the editing in this
Your creap cake was better than that creap cake and the chocolate ganash was looking very TASTY.
What did you do to your pinky
Rie's cute
Gey
These are pancakes, crepes are when you roll them up.
It’s not a crayp it’s a crep
Umm im fasting
rie is cooking mama
Honestly tho I could watch tasty vids hours and hours , so stratified ☺️☺️
Niki, you should get a little blue steel crepe pan (the edges are only about 1/2 inch high and beveled outward). They are pretty inexpensive and will save you from getting burns on your hands. I make crepes pretty often and I love mine. Btw, I do have to butter the pan just before the first crepe (which usually doesn't turn out pretty, but still tastes good), but it doesn't need butter before any of the rest of the crepes.
When there are tons of people in the comments wondering Nikki's sexuality and being confused about her having a wife when she did an entire Buzzfeed series about getting married 😂
Rie is the best!!!
I ENJOY WATCHING THIS
I’ve never ever ever ever ever made a crepe in my life but even I could tell her first tries were WAY too dense looking 🤣😩
She did use expired milk the first time
possibly the most adorable thing I've watched in my life
I'm 11 and I make crepes since I was 8 and the batter is waaaaay esier! You Just need eggs milk and flour. You only use butter on the pan so the crepe do not sticks on it. I'm also italian so I know what I'm saying. You don't have to let chill the 'dough'. If you let chill the dough, the crepes are gonna lose the taste and the sugar that you put in is gonna overvalm the good  stuff
i’ve made chocolate crepe cakes before (even have a video on my channel #ad) and the first ones are always in the weirdest and worst condition 😂
im fasting right now:'((
check out the chocolate crepe cake i made on my channel, it’s basically diabetes 😂👌🏼
Andrew's would be called the creep crepe cake haha XD
i love when life gives you chocolate
Loved this but PUT ANDREW AND NIKI BACK TOGETHER THANKS
Try doing Vegan food
Why is part of the cake pixelated at the end???
Im confused about nikis wife 😮😮 not offending anybody just confuse
Lesbian?!
wow chocolate crapes
Crepes is swedish pancakes or ”pannkakor” in swedish👍🏼
Who washes the dishes?
1:04 I thought it was Niki EDITED: They attached the crepe tht looks like a... u know
I thought she said crape EDITED: Oh my Niki has a wife i thought she was shiting
why is part of the cake blurred at 12:09?
Make a unicorn cake!
‘Melk’
is it just me or Rie is fucking cute
Ok, the pan is totally wrong for making crèpes, you need a very thin an with alwost no edges, and you should always add a little bit of oil (like sunflower) or melted butter in the batter.... it's less sticky that way.
Is she lesbian?
Nicki is a way more adorable host than Andrew
Rie is so cool.
I love Niki ... this is my favorite show on tasty
I thought You said at beginning EATING YOUR FEET(FEED)😂😂
Someone please tell my school the ONLY assembly I’m going to is a cake assembly
I loved Andrew peeping trough the door😘😂❤️
I'm European and it's not pronounce that way
Rie is like the mother of all and she actually help others I remember the time Rie help the woman in the video if im right tue jiggly cake i think
Did she just say craip
i thought nikki is a girl she has a wife!!
BTW Did she really call her wife ??!!
Ramadan Mubarak my Muslim brothers and sisters ❤
Niki: I make crepes all the time. I'm good at making crepes. I'll just modify my own recipe. Me: Checks run time again. Well failure is rarely this obvious.  Niki: calls wife, tells her to be honest. Am I good at making crepes. Wife: pause
Ha gayy
I cringed that she used that milk. No way ain't risking that.
12:04 lol they missed the hi five
Also, genache is french for "fool" or "idiot". I heard it was invented when a cooking assistant accidentaly dropped a cup of cream into melted chocolate and the chef was screaming at him first, that he was a fool, but after tasting he liked it so much, that he continued using it in recipes :)
Me watching this is torture like I want
yummy 😋
Niki is god
The use by dates are only the dates, for which the manufacturers can absolutely guarantee that the products are safe to consume. Unless that milk has been sitting in the sun, one day over is more than fine! And if you store your products right, they can last you even longer. We all should try to minimize food waste, but thanks for always making enjoyable videos :)
go foward to 6:30 for the recipe..
I’m gd at making craps
The way she pronounces crêpes is just horrid
3:48 We have a proverb which says "the first pancake is always spoiled" in Russian so its ok.
Coco powder does not have gluten..will definitely make crepes...prrrffup And use a crepe pan
I would trade 10 years of life to just work at tasty. It's a fucking dream job. Where do you apply?
Niki where did you get your shirt? It's so cute
I had to make 40 crepes for my French class at 4:00 in the morning. I was dead afterwards
everytime she says “creips” i die a little
Creape. Really.
Whiner... complains too much
4:46 my whole life summarized into one moment.
you creep
NIKI IS LESBIAN?
Cream Watch 2018 need to be a thing lol
She said "I can call my wife" and my lesbian heart exploded
3:37 Have you been SAYING crepes for a long time? 🤣
666k views
HAHAHAHAHAHA OMG 4:35 I’m ded
Anyone else notice how they always start this series with 'Okay. So here we are.'?
i love this show!
I bet this is what made +howtobasic snap.
666k views
If you think milk really goes bad the day it says on there then you’re sheltered asf😂🤦🏾‍♀️
Are you there? I WAS THERE 😂😂😂
Rie should have her own show
That dck thoo 😂😂😂😂
Wait nikki’s a lesbian?   Wow
Does Rie ever actually do anything
love how they blamed the first one on the batter and won't just say that the One Top cooker sucks
I'm on a diet Man i should'n click this thing at first
Yummy
Lol what’s with the censors at 12:09
eh .. too much drama !
I like Rie. I think she is pretty
She must be high. 😂 I love this channel.
I hope she's eating Trader Joe's gummy bears. Those things are amazing.
Wait wife? I didnt know she was bi
ack this is one of the best serieses(??????how to spell?? what the fuck)
Tip of the day: USE RIE's recipe
PLEASE POST MOREE VIDEOS LIKE THISSS!!
andrew is hot af... we just need him in every single buzzfeed video
Did she say "turd" or "the private part of a male"
*reads crepe*  Pronounces: *CrAPes*  Btw no hate.
Amazing
I my family drinks a 4 liter jug of milk in...3-4 days....I drink it every day.
Aww I think it’s so cute when I see the wedding ring on people! It’s a common thing but it just makes me happy :)
I thought Steven was going to propose Nikki
Wait shes lesbian
Lol! Rie is getting sassy and I love it!
Sweet Baby Jesus that's beautiful. OMG.
I like the subtle queer sticker to cover the Apple logo
The audio of this video makes it very hard to watch. There's a high pitched whine or static sound at some parts and its not appealing to the ears at all.
why is the a pixel on the cake at 12:09
Adam has to try making a dish🔥🔥😂❤
my best friend is andrew- no its not its adam
Idk why she reminds me of Linda Belcher of Bob's Burgers
Rie answer when asked what gonache means😂😂😂 10:40
love the editing
7:59 it looks familliar🙄
It’s because the tasty hot plate sucks
She is a lesbian?
If andrew is there.... nikki is not there... and here ..nikki is there but where is andrew😅😅😅  we actually asked for both ppl together
I have to many crepes today and I want more!
The reason it was getting only hot in the middle was because the Tasty induction cook-top has a hot spot in the middle, which also might be the reason she was having trouble at the start.
Love this series!!
Go niki go
*rememberes 100 layer lasagna*
Just a suggestion, maybe you should dip your fingers in ice water before touching the hot pan
Why is part of the cake pixelated at the end? What are you hiding, Tasty?!
This has the *best* editing.
Mmm. Diabetes
Oh I can answer that! Nikki Ganache meant "Fool" in old french. Its a type of chocolate that was made by mistake! An old chef was teaching an apprentice and the apprentice accidentally dumped too much cream into it. The master called them a fool and sent them away. But when he tasted it later he realized it was delicious and then started selling it and teaching it and taking credit for it. He called it Ganache because it was a foolish mistake.
I hate fasting now
everytime you said "crApes"  a part of me died.
I kinda always see Rie when i watch tasty videos.Is it just me or no😂
I was so annoyed because of the way she pronounced crepe
That tasty electric stove is the problem it does not work
I like that tasty is doing more behind tasty videos and things like this where they show somebody making a tasty recipe and how truly difficult it can be. It encourages me more to try their recipes because if I make a few mistakes or have to try over I know that it’s not that I’m just not a professional and can’t do it correctly, even they go through this stuff.
LIKED FOR ADAM 😍
i love this series
pls make giant foods
You need a Crepe Pan, for the love of God! Lol
They used a cast iron skillet to cook the crepes for even cooking temperatures.
I use a non-stick pan to make crepes. I hate using induction burner. I like a ​real stove.
I never knew she was lesbian.. how can I be so blind
This was so embarrassing to watch. As someone who makes a lot of crepes I couldn't believe how this went about. The plastic rainbow whisk? Like what are you doing? Making a fashion statement or trying to cook? Crepes are SO easy to make. Alton brown uses a blender for his, I mix my eggs and melted butter first so it incorporates otherwise it just droplets in the cold milk. You need your batter to be cold, you need the starches to hydrate--I don't know just the level of novice on this was embarrassing.  I love tasty Videos, I love watching the cooks make or try to recreate fancy stuff and seeing the warts and all of the process, but you don't look like you know what you're doing at all. I hope your show isn't taking much in the way of resources away from the other hosts.  Good for Rie for helping you out though. I hope she's as honest/blunt with you as I am. I don't know what the editor was going for when they put this episode together to make me feel this way but, well done.
This is me doing tasty recipes
Niki should do croissants 🥐 next
Wait, so Niki has a wife? I didn't know that, I don't pay attention to your guys love lives
I'm a Muslim thats fasting right now and I regret watching this cuz it made me hungry .But the cake looks so delicious!
the way she says crêpes gives me anxiety ( french speakers will relate )
When you buy new milk because its 1 day expired
Rye laughing at 12:57
Your crepes weren’t baking well because the hot plate made by Tasty doesn’t cook evenly.
Amazing efforts!!
I've made a crepe cake and it was delicious.
Hey  so I did some research and Ganache is a literally derived from the French word for fool. Technically they were spreading fool on their crepe cake.
It was a missed opportunity when they said scrape instead of screpe
I don't remember... 😂
she is sooo Fucking annoying 😒
HAHAHA love this
Why did they censor part of the cake at 12:07?
Omg, do Americans say "Crapes"? -Shudder-  I'm British and I say "Crepps".
Can u do 100 layer crepe cake
I know this is sad but..... I have never had a crepe
Do they really think that the date on food is the exact spoil date.
I made crepes yesterday!
Rie is like the ultimate chef in Tasty cause almost everyone asks for her help 😂😂
Rie is my favorite!
Can we have ashly and andrew collab😆
OMG I commented too early. I love the second song even more! "Cooking crepes three at a time" is going to be a even bigger hit!
It’d would be easier to make if you used an actual stove top or a good portable cooktop, one that doesn’t have hot spots
Omg I love Nikki sm😂
ok i love the song. what song? I'm glad you asked. "Cooking Crepes two at a time" it's a hit!
You don’t have to flip crepes
I love this show! ❤️
We need Rie in more of these videos. She is the best.
The second she said wife I froze 😂😂 5:53
She lesbian?
The tasty onetop is bad at heat distribution. The center gets all the heat.
When she cut it and took it out, oh my! soooooooo beautiful!
When Annie was eating it, for some reason she reminded me of Touka from Tokyo Ghoul. She was eating human food.
Can i have some?
I LOVE RIEE I just needed to get that off my chest. BUT I FREAKING LOVEEE RIE.
1:48 NASTY 👃 😷 🤢
She definitely makes crepes look more complicated than they are. If you’re a newbie out there, you probably won’t get them right the first time you make them (the flip I mean). But after you get the hang of them (and make sure the temp is right, if the stove is too low the crepes come out rubbery. If too high, you burn them) they really are as simple as making pancakes
"... just answer honestly okay"      Meaning: "No matter what I ask, I need you to lie for me really quick, okay"
Oh man, this is a beautiful finished product.
OW!
Damn she's a lesbian she's so cute tho
0:30 why did they credit themselves?😂
I freaking love rie
If you guys want it dark like the original video, use Dutch processed cocoa
Rie reminds me a lot of Collete from Ratatouille hehe <3
I love this team. SO. MUCH. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is she gay??????
Who decided on the title of the series?
Its like pancake
You guys are really complaining lol . I thought it was pronounced "Crape" as well. 😂😂
Finally I've been waiting for this episode for so long !!!!!!!!!
IS NIKKI A LESBIAN!?
PLZ MAKE JAPANESE SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE
Rie is amazing! She's super talented and makes everything seem si easy
O.M.G          Me...
This was even so much effort to watch
I tried making a pancake and then by accident I made a crepe
I feel like Niki and Garret should be a couple even though she’s married and a lesbian
Honestly though it’s because the buzzfeed cooktop heats really unevenly and it burns really fast in the middle.
Recepi  1 3/4 cup of flour 1/4 cup cocoa powder 7 tablespoon sugar 6 eggs 6 tablespoon melted butter 3 cups milk (half cup at a time) Mix well & strained Cover the dough. Leave for 30 minutes  Making Cake assembly 4 Cups of cream. Whip.it up Crepe+cream  Chocolate Ganache (heat up) 2 Cups of cream 4 tablespoons sugar  cut chocolate bar  pour heated cream into chocolate chunks  Cut cake with bowl on top  Make cake 😍
Make crepe is not easy like it seem. Flip the crepe is very hard.
very yummy
It could be the out of date milk
Tbh, the problem with the uneven cooking might be bc of the Tasty One Top. Not trying to criticize too much, but my friends have it and they seem to have the problem of there being an uneven heat distribution throughout their pans. Now, I know it isn't a problem with the pans because on their normal stovetops they work like a charm. I'd really appreciate it if Tasty could redesign their One Top to get an even heat  P.S * Please don't get angry at me I'm just here to offer some constructive criticism!*
Egg juice 😆
$5 chocolate crepes vs $500 chocolate crepes.
thats a PEA**S
12:09 if you see the blur 😂
Its that stupid tasty hob thing.... they’re horrible!
i like this show because it shows that tasty chefs are actually human and they don’t make everything perfect so yay thanks for being relatable :)
Where is homebuddies T^T
I wonder if Adam is the one who edits this video
how about "we tried to make this princesstorte"?
I love you do muchhhh shes so cute
I wonder who washes all the pots, pans and dishes for tasty shoots... they must pile up real fast lol
I like Rie
That looks delicious,  but I'd never try to make it. Too much stress lol.
The girl version of Ned 😂😂 I’ll call my wife
These people keep saying how she is saying Crepe wrong.... "Crape" Is also a way to say Crepe, now stop
My sister made a crepe cake once and I couldn’t eat it like a normal cake. I kept taking one layer, rolling it around my fork and ate it that way.... one layer at a time.  It was just fun to eat that way.
I need a Rie to help me with my cooking disasters
Day old? Oh hell no
*jeez Adam just want some damn food*
*craype*
niki's WIFE?:O
You know that u can't tast bacteria
niki's WIFE????:P
That is a T H I C C batter
"yay" how cute xD
Rie and Niki are really fun to watch! I hope you guys keep doing these kind of videos!
Lmao are u really censored a pancake
What did the woman on the right say at 5:41?? I NEED TO UNDERSTAND
Who has to do the dishes???
Wait... Niki  is lesbian?
cRAPE
This is me as a person i swear😂
The tasty one top heats very unevenly, that's probably why it wasn't working
I love how she put the “decoration” on the cake 😂😂😂
the way she say crepè
Loved this video. ❤
Random question......who here likes bts?
this girl is such a bum😂😂
Rie's face though.
If BuzzFeed needs a dishwasher call me lol
I love this section! It's so fun to see you cook everything and fail a couple of times 😂🤣 cooking its no for the weak! You need to keep trying until you learn how😣🤗
The question is why?
Great job. Well done!👍😙
Thank God you messed up so much or I would have missed that extra ad.
I love how they make money off of themselves
Your batter is so WET OMG
Niki has a wife? So who is Niki to her wife?
I hope your pinky gets better
love Niki
I screamed everytime she pronounced crêpes wrong 🌝
Using wrong pan!  Has to be a non stick!
I’m a simple person, I see niki I click
it's the stove top, it's easier when you use a gas stove top.
Rie is blooming!!!!
People try fasting for the first time plz
No andrew no good 😀
andrew is my spirit animal
Egg juice
Adam is everyone’s best friend, non?
Level it up : Rainbow Crepe Cake
I am a big fan of crepes.....      Who isn’t.....     And if you aren’t kill your waffles!
loves crepe but can't even say the word properly smh
This video just shows the stupidity in humans that they will continuously burn them selves lol
Its the shitty tasty electric stove
Rie and Nikki forgot about the cocoa powder.
She should be wearing a blue plaster, when preparing food!!
This made my day... 😁 I can't stop laughing... 😂
Ogres are like crepe cakes, “ogres have layers” quote the shrek
I love how at 12:04 they failed the clap 😂😂
No sé mucho inglés, solo palabras sueltas, a mis 54 años el ingles me cuesta, jajajaja pero mi hija habla excelente y me tradujo lo que no entendía y preparé el postre. Es riquísimo. Gracias. Bendiciones para ti y tu equipo, tienen muy buena energía y humor. Cariños desde Argentina 😍😍😍😍😍
What would life be without rie hahahaha
It makes me cringe everytime she pronounces "crepes".
It's a common sense..  Too thin layer--> you need thicker mixture 💔
Why am I watching this late at night?
niki is an idiot. when the world ends , she is the type of person who will be screaming, crying , and complaining about everything.
CRAPE???? ISN'T IT CREP??
I love how they censored the Little Crêpe 😂😂
Lol I broke my pinky this year Too   Like if you did the same
but I'm a crepe I'm a weirdo what the hell am i doing here i don't belong here
There are Crepes Not grapes
Andrew is clapping lololol
*o g r e s h a v e l a y e r s*
Who else is sick of seeing Rie again n again
This girl omg she’s so great
Use a crepe pan god dammit
No offense nicki, but maybe you should be using a crêpe pan with a crêpe spreader
Rie to the rescueeee
the reason why its not cooking properly is actually because of the tasty stove top. the middle of the pan heats up a lot and doesn't disperse the heat very well.
Does everyone who left Buzzfeed end up here?  😂😂😂
Egg juice 😂😂
You have to put flour in it 😆
what was that tiny mosaic at 12:08 LOOOOL  ah the dik
I now have a crush on Adam eventhough he doesn't talk too much haha
12:55 why is there a blur on the cake......................never mind
That's like almost the same video as the rainbow one
12:08 SHE  PUT THE PENIS ON THE SIDE OF THE CAKE IM DYINGGG
Who the fuck would actually watch this on their free time
She's Lesbian?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1rZAT2GtmI
the tasty cook top isn't good it dont cook evenly
Nom nom nom ship one to me nom nom
3:24 the inside is cooking faster than the outside because tasty’s stovetop you are using is a bad product. there’s a video where chefs test it with the flour burn test and it only burnt in a small ring on the inside.
Help... I’m hungry!
Egg juice..............
I had to turn this off after 30 seconds and you kept pronouncing crepe wrong.
AT 12:08 THEY CENSORED SOMETHING. WHY AND WHAT IS THAT.
I’m lame but I got so happy when she said “my wife” 😭😭😭
Looks difficult but duable. My issue is whenever I attempt crepes they fail and look like pikelets
More of this
Why do they pronounce it “crApe” like grape??? It’s written Crêpe, even in american way you won’t pronounce it with an a....
Expired Milk is verre good in baking actualy for cakes and pancakes and crapes etc
0:29 why are you giving footage credit to your own damn channel
Why did they censor *penis*
ITS PRONOUNCED CREP
Why not use a crepe pan? We used it all the time in my French class back in high school
honey, you’re perfectly fine. the inside it cooking faster because you’re using shitty stove top from tasty. trash
12:46 they misspelled 'mattress'
2:17 “egg juice’’
Kreyp? Thought it is krep
is niki lesbian
Great job! You deserve a gold medal after all that 🤣
Wait niki has a wife
I have been watching this vids for ever and I didn’t know Niki had a wife, I’m so dumb😂
Tbh I had no idea Niki was lesbian
call me next time you try making crêpes
when your to ugly to get a husband so you need a wife...
That's regular pancakes... ;-;
I thought it was pronounced cree pey
Crêpes are made out of flour, eggs and milk. There’s nothing else!
The blurred crepe penis makes this 😂
Adorable cookers XD LOL
Crepes are easy to make lol
❤️RIE❤️
It's a crêpe not a craip 😂😂
That cake should be called "the ultimate diabetes"
I am only here for ADAM
the crepes got messed up at the beginning because the Tasty stove they used sucks ass!!! it heats the middle and not the outside which is prob why niki's crepes cooked from inside out first ):
I feel bad for Rie sometimes 😂
U should have keep it in freeze and then cut it
I love Niki ❤
Can we have the crepe song on Spotify please?
I can’t hear crepe it’s called Crêpe goddddammiitt
Rie to the rescue 😝😂
I wish she’d review Kybella for us viewers 🙃
YOU SUCK
Rie's smile gives me life
100 layer crepes cake
*c r a p e s*
YASS WE LOVE A CREPE LOVING QUEEN 👸💁‍♀️
This is my favorite series on buzzfeed
Rie reminds me of the girl chef from ratatouille
Oh shes a lesbian
When you have high expectations 😂 always me.
i love how much adam contributes to the channel yet hes only a camera and audio guy
shes a lesbian hahahaha
what was blurred out on the left side at 12:08?
I have made it before😜😜😍😍
This was super fun to watch :D
12:40 omg Andrews forehead is huge especially if he pushed his hair back I’m dying😂
It's so easy actually I did it before and It wasn't a complicated thing
damn she looks weird
The girl by Niki at 13:09 was like,"I'm over it!"
Skimmed milk + butter ? Really ? That's just stupid Plus don't use a pan to make crêpes
Man she probably eats her wife out.
'crapes'
Where is Ashley and Steven ?!?!?!!
I LOVE these!!! More more more!!
Did anyone else see that blur at 12:09 and 12:34
Andrew , was it worth it at its non disclosed price point?
Is she a lesbian?
The amount of food most americans wastes,  make me sad
Where I Steven??!?
😂
andrew's bed-head
10:48  Niki how dare you question tasty queen rei’s ability to chop chocolate lol
For the record you can use milk 7 days pass the expiration date.
Ohhh it got me when she said CRAIPE sorry im from the uk and we say crepe… no hate it looks so good!
I think it is pronounced "krEp"
It's your stove top--there are reviews of the Buzzfeed stove top that show it gets EXTREMELY hot in the middle and cold on the outside (they do a flour test that scorches the flour, showing any hot spots on the pan). For crepes I'm pretty sure you want an even, broad heating surface. That's probably why it was cooking so quickly in the middle but was wet on the outside when generally it should be drying up on the outside first because of the thin edges!
i hate the way she says crepes like 😭😭😭
Ur mum giey
2:55 "yay!" I LOVE HER
Isn’t this just them exposing themselves 😂
I’d happily eat that xx
Rie makes this show!
That fart noise
bruh this one doesn’t make sense she’s recreating buzzfeed’s own tasty video 0/10
„Kraips“
The inside is cooking faster because of the dumb tasty hot plate 👀👀
As a Serb-crepes are like one of our favourite foods and we eat them in many ways, that is not how you make crepes omg
And I tried making this before and the batter was bad too 😂 Just saying but a plain one tastes best
Holy crepe.
Whenever I make crepes I use oil instead of water and I dont let it rest cause Im savage
What was that pixelisation at about 12:10
Lol my mom makes crepes in 5 minutes
ITS NOT CRAPE IT IS CRÈP !!!!!!!!!!!
Rie is amazing. I love it whenever she's in the video Gah
My mom used to do this to me, I loved it
That stove top is pretty bad..
it's crehhp not effing crayyp.  :)
Oh, she's a lesbian, I didn't know. XD
Rieeee!!!!!
RIE IS LITERALLY COLLETTE FROM RATATOUILLE!😍😍😍😍
Expiration dates aren't necessarily when a food actually goes bad. Places tend to bump up the expiration date by a few days to create a higher turnover rate so you'll spend more money buying more food.
uneven heating pan fromthe tasty induction heater which caused uneven cooking of the batter. Design flaw of the Tasty cooker
Why is the left side of the cake censured at 12:09 ?
I felt bad when Niki said that she was going to call her wife I get confused.
12:08... Why is there a censored part on the cake??? Oh nvm they explain it 12:58
I’m telling you it’s not her, it’s the damn stove They have hot spots and don’t cook evenly
I love when she says "My Wife". Good job America. It took you forever but good job
At least it's not *crepe*
It’s cuz she’s using an induction stove
Peeping Andrew
She's such a stupid person omg. Firstly, CRAPE???? What the fuck Secondly, Tasty's kitchen has a lot of tools and yet she uses her hands to pick them up
BURNT FINGERTIPS
Shes gaye
The final result looked awesome 🍰
She is really cute
tasty, it's your stovetop. I saw an review where your stove tops did not cook things evenly, probably why it didn't work as the middle cooked faster and burned rather than the outer, which was undercooked so could not be flipped. Next time stick to non stick PANS
80 % of the reviews' section is literally about how she pronounced "crêpe" crape.
How much pain does it need to cook a chocolate crepe cake??
Love Andrew
Damn Rie is a savage😂 "I don't remember.." "oh we're you there??"😭
Dish soap
“Crape”
I love that Nikki has a wife 😍 so cute
Niki's married? Aww.... my dreams are shattered.
12:09 why is the left side censored ?? lol
When u find out she’s gay
props my favorite segment on tasty
With dairy products, the date is best before so it still is good after that but you need to make sure. With meat products, the date is use before so the date is the last day it is safe to use STILL MAKE SURE IT IS GOOD but it still can be used few days after but with caution.
I love that they include adam in everything
pronounce words correct buzzfeed
Aren't they just pancakes? I mean in my country that's how you make the pancake butter. :/
The amount of dishes dirtied in this is driving me crazy.
ugh it's 4am here in ph im hungry
The reason for the uneven cooking is because of their buzzfeed brand hot plate.
Rie is honestly the most iconic person at tasty
What do you mean her wife is she kidding?
10:31 Andrew: I regret not helping with this video....
Hi tasty I am having a birthday in 3 weeks and I think it would be amazing if you could bake a cake for me
HA! GAYYYYY
Adam is the real national treasure
Ya'll had to censor that crepe cake penis.
the problem is the tasty top
Rie getting annoyed by her when helping to make ganache...lol
U guys have soo much fun working! Wish I could work with you guys!!
Anyone else fasting?
Asks about the dishes and not the crepe cake 😂
I wonder why the middle is cooking first? Maybe it’s the terrible tasty one top
This video exemplifies why it's important to follow the recipe directions when mixing a batter instead of thinking you've got a better and more efficient way. Making crepes isn't super difficult, but she made it nearly impossible by mixing the batter in a really wonky, weird way to start. The ingredients are listed in a particular order with instructions for a reason.
Its funny how americans cant do crepes while in central europe almost no one makes pancakes but crepes
ganache means donkey
The word Ganach comes from the French. A bakery had a trainee who accidentally gave milk in some mix and the chef donned it as "Ganach" (donkey in French). And then the chef ate it and it was really dilicios and so he called it Ganache :3 ... German TV for the win 😂
Can Nikki and Ned be in videos together?? "My wife" they all be saying my wife, my wife all the time 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Don't look at these! Look at that!!" So cute 💞
12:03 Best High five
i relate to this on a spiritual level
It's pronounced crep..... Not crape
Crepe "cakes" are way overrated anyway.
13:02 So done
Is Niki lesbian??
100 layer crepe cake!!!!!
Anyone remember from the jiggly cheesecake vid: no lumps no lumps no lumps
I'm fasting... This is mistake, but imma keep watching
Don’t feel bad, Niki.  I always end up throwing out the first couple of crepes.
Who made the one in Tasty? Was it Alexis or Alix or someone else?
why does she say ganache better than crêpe
Watching her cook hurts.... Crepes are basically thin pancakes, and they arent even that hard to make... At least at the end she got the hang of it  Plus, i can assure you, for these you can even use kefir, yogurt, fat milk, cream, and even expired and curdled milk (as long as it doesnt have mold on it already). Once you cook it, its fine to eat.
Why does that other girl always looked uninterested or annoyed in whatever video that she appears in? Her constant expression is that of 12:42 where she's looking over Andrew.
100 layers crepe cake?
It might also be the hot plate your using I saw someone use it and it only cooks a certain places not all around your pan
„I‘m a big fan of creeps“ lmaooo
WHY IS SHE SAYING CRAPES IT'S CREPES
David Seymour is gonna kick your ass for trying to steal his gig.
I hate the way u say crepe
Omg, that looks good
The main crêpe maker sounds so British with American accent I wonder if she grew up partly in the UK.  Ps. What was the pixelated bleeped 'pea' at the end?
honesty at 13:08 you have that background music, i sounds way too much like the Wii sound only without the TUTUTU
her 'whisking' made me cringe and i'm not even a professional >~<
gotta watch eater's review on the stove
I love how they did a whole five minute bit about how it was the crepe batter's fault but refused to acknowledge that the actual problem was the fact that the Tasty OneTop is super shitty. (The uncooked ring she got around the outside of the crepes was because of the OneTop, not because of her batter.)
Omg
Rie is like this Amazing Tasty wizard! (Or witch!)
WHAT!!😱
The uneven cooking was because of that thing she’s cooking on its quite a common problem of it
10:30
Anyone here fasting? XD
Sorry, Andrew. There is no pea but there is a PEAnis. Hehehehehehe
10:32
“Egg juice”😆
Omg stop saying “crape” it’s crepe as in (crep)
Hell no i am not watching this she is gay
Put Adam cook something
Wtf is a “crape”
I made cookies today and I feel very unskilled😂😂
we need a video with only Rie!!! She is so pure!!! She's what the people want!!!!
The person who's editing this videos it's doing a great job.
If you look she was using a tasty cooker which has a huge hot spot in the middle
9:05 I was like : Noooooo she’s gonna burn herself !!!! 😂
I LOVEE NIKII 😭😭
Favorite show ATM!!!!  Love Andrew Nikki and Adam!! And Rie! Good job guys<3
I think it’s the tasty stove I heard that it’s significantly hotter in the middle compared to the outside
It was so cute when Niki was like “I can call my wife and she can tell you” awww ❤️😂
:0 Niki is married?! Also had no clue she was a lesbian, I love her more now 😂
i don't know about the pan , i feel like it's not good like the non adhesive part isn't great
yay Niki xxx
The one top only gets hot in the middle lmao, watch the review by Eater
we love mother daughter cooking sessions
Ahhh I love Niki’s style!!!!
" I Tried " Anal For The First Time Butt She Farted On My Dick :'(
Wow
I love Rie and her nonchalant attitude about everything lmao
Wait is she lesbian????
I love Tasty's videos, especially Eating Your Feed but... what are you doing with the crepes' batter ?! xD Why are you straining the batter ?  I'm French and I'm feeling so frustrated not being here with you to make real French crepes T_T
Niki have,, wife"? Omg 😔😠😡😹 this people is out of mind
I use Martha Stewart’s crepe recipe, it’s great no fail !
Nikis version honestly looks better than the tasty one
This girl cracks me up
“I’m not trying to be fancy I have a broken pinkie and I can’t get ... egg juice... on it “  LMAO EGG JUICE 😂😂😂😂😂
Awesome
What is she even doing? XD
how is Rie the literal best
Yayyyyyyyyy!!!!!!! Nikki is backkkk!!!!!
Gay!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WAIT!!! does she actually have a wife?? and If she does that is just weird!😕😕😣😒
I wonder who does all the dishes in the tasty kitchen
OMG SHE IS SO CUTEEEEEEEE
Keep this series up!! One of my absolute faves from your channel!
Yummy 😍😍😍
You need to rest the crepe batter to let the gluten relax and prevent very chewy crepes. With crepes, you overdevelop gluten because of the length of time you mix it. So resting it would help.
I like it brother
Why the hell is she overacting ????
THIS IS SO CRINGE AAAAHHHH YOU DONT FLIP CRÊPES WITH YOUR FINGERS AND ALSO YOU ARE SHAKING THE PAN TOO MUCH, THE BATTER LOOKS TOO THICK, AND ITS OVERALL MAKING THEM COOK INCONSISTENTLY AAAHHH
More Niki and Adam collabs please!
“Craypes” 🙄
Don’t know what crapes are but they look a lot like crêpes
Who the hell use fingers to flip. U burn your hands!
Did she add too many eggs....did she even add the melted butter....but the real reason it didn't work is because she mispronounced crèpe
Why I watching this? Really craving.........
Wait nikki has a wife
THIS WOMAN HAS A WIFE.SERIOUSLY NIKI HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
wait niki is lesbian?
Ganache is French for dump
This is not the right pan for making crêpes! It must be really hard with this one
you should said fuck it and made an ice cream crepe cake granted you have to chill it more and be quicker with the spread and the ice cream would have to be sauve enough for you to spread it
I miss homebuddies:c
Don't put too much sugar in the cream cuz there's already sugar in the cream? Lol, i think you meant chocolate
Andrew’s reaction to Niki’s “Pea”: Excuse me?! 😂
wait, you flip a crepe? Isn't the whole point of it being thin that you don't have to flip it?
The way she says crepes triggers me....
Взрослые люди, пытающиеся быть детьми, выглядят убого
That Niki is a bitch
You say so much chocolate. I say not enough.
I'm surpised.... I wasn't expecting that niki was lesbian :/
that batter was too thin to begin with...
I'm always so proud of her when she gets it right lol
12:08 on the left of the cake
More videos please
we need andrew .....this is boaring that dude is another level of comedy ....
ur funny
I love Rie she’s so chill 😹
What happens to your finger
Niki: We have actually gone out to eat crepe cakes together before Rie:  You were there?
You needed nore batter in the pan, the crepes were too thin
I tried making these and after some tweaks I did it! I just used more butter in the pan and made the crepes a little bit thicker so that they wouldn't break
You should make it again but instead for 20 layers, make it 100
Crepes not CreIpes
The way she pronounces "crêpe" makes me want to die
What's wrong with Niki having a wife??? You didn't know it that's your point not Niki's bruh
Why is there a blurred out spot on the left at 12:09?
If you're cooking them on both sides, then they're English pancakes. Crepes are cooked on one side.
You are very funny.....but good job👏🏾👏🏾
The cooktop is terrible and only cooks at the center, which is why the crêpes were not cooking evenly
I love this type of videos 💕
Wtf !...Niki has awife ?..how
Who's fasting?😭
Wow that actually looks so good 👏👏👏👏
*crapes* I'm sorry, but it bothers me the entire video, I've only heard it as 'crEpes'. Still live the video! I'll just never get used to the American way of saying things :)
this is actually the reality of making food from their videos thats like fast asf lmao
I miss House Buddies. What happened to Garret?
12:08 i see you put the interesting looking crepe to the cake.
What about Garret isn’t he like Nicky’s real friend to?
12:03 fail😂💔
YT and Buzzfeed have gone to the point where it's necessary to censor a penis on screen / if they say it. And it's not even a real dick it's made of batter. What has YT become.
can someone please tell me the music they used at 0:45 (when rie came out) till 1:02 cause I swear I’ve heard that theme somewhere I just don’t remember what!!
...they literally remade their own video
Rie is savage! Love!
worth it and this are like the only good things being produced by buzzfeed atm!!!!
Why do Americans say crape there’s no a in the word how did they come up with that
omggg niki is so cute, i think she might be my new buzzfeed fav
Can Rie be my cooking teacher/mom?
is it not crep
Who can’t love niki❤️❤️❤️
Make sure this becomes a series
when I hear smore I said CAKE SMORE
I would look forward to work if I worked at tasty
again and again, it's always the detail that mess up everything...
😂😂she’s great!!!
stop at 12:04 lol
7:02 That casual 'this company made whisk is actually pretty shit for whisking' comment... xD
Why wasn't andrew the whole episode ? :(
“You were there?” #dead
*egg* *juice*
Damn, I thought for sure she was gonna do a jiggly Japanese cheesecake again - I guess even BuzzFeed realized they were totally overusing that cheesecake.
why are people judging her looks, ?! "she is ugly" !!?? wat de hell.!? she may not be super cute or anything, bt stil... I hop al ya people calling her ugly are really Mr or Ms Gorgeous face.. she was trying to help making crepe cakes, for beginners.. I ddnt feel like watching it tho.. bt I donno y al people here went on her luks than her cooking.. wer on earth u need to luk gud to cook.....
Your pan is just wrong for making crepes... lol
Onions = crepe cake = layers = ogres  (If you’ve been living under a rock your whole life this is a shrek reference)
I love her whisk
*/crape/*
The batter tooooooo thin duhhhh
Niki is gay?
Using a crepe pan might have made it easier.
I cringed throughout this whole video bc of the way she pronounced crepes
That rainbow whisk tho
At 4:18 I was like.....no no don't drop that..it's Perfect😍
Rie is so blunt 😂
I didn’t know that she was married
Expiration Dates are a scam
This video is so stressful
We love a supportive wife
Andrew is the real star...
Is she lesbian?
Shes fucking ugly
Is she lesbian?
2:49 no lumps
Did Adam just shavedddd?! 😱😂
Please try to talk less :/ thank you for the idea it seems delicious
pls make churros
Please, stop saying "Craip"   It's "Crêpe"!
Im sorry but she has this very ugly nose and overall face
Hey it’s the Asian girl who gets triggered easily by men who sit with their legs wide
niki's gay?
Looks delicious
You should make lamingtons
I didn't know Niki is a lesbian .... Niki has a wife T.T
Who else is fasting 😂?
I come here for Rie
The way she says crepes is driving me crazy
Rie is so cute i love her
I like creeps too.   I'm sorry but does every American pronounce crêpe like creep?
dang she really is good at making crepes when she has the recipe
What’s blurred out at 12:09 I’m confused  Edit: it was the penis crepe
Ce sont des belles crêpes! Bon travail!
Am I the only one whose soul was hurt by the pan she used ? I live in France and I've made/eaten crepes all my life. The right pan definitely makes a difference and thank god Rie showed up with that wider spatula. Plus Niki, why would you put your finger tips trough this ? I was feeling your pain through the screen haha. Normally you should either flip the crepe in the air or just use the spatula. Your crepe cake looked beautiful though <3
I thought Nikki left buzzfeed ?
Why does andrew always look like a snacc
Wow that was the best thing I have ever seen number 1
sorry, but you are incredibly annoying. please go back to videos without people
Lol I'm p sure it was the stove she was using; there's ppl that reviewed it and talked about uneven cooking/slow to heat/etc (it's like buzzfeeds new stove or smth)
Is it just a British thing that we say cr-e-p-s not cr-ea-ps
This is honestly me in the kitchen, and then my mom comes in with her fancy japanese techniques and fixes all my mistakes.
I love Rie so much
5:41 - 5:50   This reaction right here
Ganache is a slang word for a fool in French.
Its just show that the tasty recipe isn’t that good but her recipe is better
Omg that looks sooooo good
Its probably the heating element, non even distribution of heat
The reason it didnt work was because of their shitty cooktop that they sell. If you watch the You Can Do This ep on the Tasty Induction Cooktop they show how its hot garbage and only heats up the middle. Poor girl desperately trying to make crepes on that thing xd
Why is there a censor box at 12:08? Also, I'm loving these videos.
Eheh that's cute, but there is a tips if  you want to make some crepe : buy a "bilig" is the original thing for doing them. It's easier and don't worry, the first one is always failed! ^^ even for us Breton! XD still, nice idea that crepe cake!
butter in the pan..?
Fasting while watching this.....😭😭😭
Useless bitch
Bet it failed cause she used the fucking one top
Niki: We went to brunch together  Rie: You were there?!   I relate to this so much 😔😂
I feel the frustration at 5:10 😂 Same.   Especially after trying to do something over and over that you thought wasn’t going to be that hard. 😂😂😂
Omigod you guys CREAM WATCH 2018 you get it it's like chickenwatch
“Um excuse me?” 😂
*”Well Rested Batter.”*
You gotta use a flat pan with very small to no  edges, it's gonna make it so much easier!
Did I just heard Adam laughing?
Look at my crepe pines.
2 types of Asian
why does "egg juice" make me so uncomfortable
It only took me about 2 hours!! AND I am only 14!!!😂🤯🤯😂.  BUT That cake looks amazing!!!😂🤯🤯🤯👍🏽👍🏽😋😋😋👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
'Ganache' meant a very long time ago 'Idiot' in French and was made by accident. A young assistant of a pastry chef accidentally mixed cream and chocolate together. His chef got upset and yelled at him calling the mixture 'Ganache'. The chef tasted the mistake anyway and decided to use it for cakes.
I’d you ever notice that they blurred the cake?
What did they blur at 12:10
pannkakstårta
Nikki: There’s a penis Andrew: Excuse me? Nikki: *turns cake around*
Rie is my favorite person. She's adorable
My mom can do rainbow crepe cake that is amazing i never lie
Rie is just my favorite in tasty she’s so talented and knows a lot of tips
Niki, when mixing batter together, you should probably use a spatula or spoon. Cause your wisk will quickly become a club. Lol
Rie always there to make sure no one "accidentally" dies
I looooove rie     NO HOMO
I love Nikki
Is Rie single
Nikki <3
Is she gay what if she is i dont care
Isn’t the texture of that really weird when eating?
Why is word penis censored?
It looked like they missed the high five so they just edited a sound over it to cover it up 😂
Good 😊it is very tasty
her broken pinkie hasn't healed yet? whew
tasty promoting themselves for nearly 14 mins straight
I also want to be friends with Adam
The way she's pronouncing crêpe is really irritating
Niki has a wife? Wow.
You guys gotta make the royal wedding cake
i've seen a video about tasty's one top induction and it seems that this induction she used is pretty shitty and does not despense heat in the outer side of the pan, that explains why it was burned in the middle but raw on the outside.
I adore Nikki so much. <3
i can't stop looking at andrew's arms... ahh shit you're a hater if you think he isn't hot!!
they always call rie to watch them so they can use her as a lifesaver later when they fail.
Anyone here who deosnt like nikki??! Why is she soo plastik??😩😩
Rie is Tasty's master chef😂💖
niki is lesbian right or not?
why is she too stupid to pronounce crêpe ?
Hi, hope you have a great day ahead. I am a teenager who has a passion for cooking. I have recently started a cooking channel and I hope you give it a chance. Thank you!!! ;)
I tried to make this once before,I wasted 9 hours of my life....
U r so cute😘😘😘😘 n funny😂😂😂😂
It’s a crEpe not a crApe
100 layer crepe cake!
She cant cook.. alix is better
Ahhh, welcome back Nikki! Do another duo with Andrew!
Maybe if they weren't using such a shitty electric burner....
Is niki boy or girl?
I heard *EATING YOUR FEET* 😂🧐
cRapE???? WTF WHO TF SAYS CRAPE INSTEAD OF crep :<
It’s pronounced crepp not crape  Americans 🤔
yum
Ever since my sister learned how to make this, we gained some weight after a few trials.
at 12:07 , why is there a censored spot on the cake?? On the left-hand side??? Why? EDIT: THERE IS A PENIS
7:58
its not a good video if mother rie isn't in it
@12:08 why is there a sensor on right side of the cake?
It mentally hurts me when she says crape instead of crepe
ITS CREP NOT CRAPE
is this series meant to just expose how hard tasty recipes are???
Frenc people are cringing right now
I really want to turn the music volume down! It was hard to hear Nicki over it, it's terrible music and distracting.
RIE LOOKS LIKE THE GIRL CHEF FROM RATATOUILLE OMGGGGG
Yeah Eat Your Feed would have been a better title. No wonder Nikki stumbles over pronouncing the title.
Can’t ever go a day without watching this channel
In the Netherlands you call them ‘pannenkoeken’
Niki wife 😄
i love how niki and rie are just opposite people ldsfjslkdf ALSO I DIDNT KNOW NIKI WAS GAY! i dont watch a lot of buzzfeed anymore slkdfjsdl
Say 'crape' one more time,  I dare you
Creeps? Crapes? Creips? WTF
Eating your feed is my fav show ever! 😃
Ganache is derived from the French word fool
So many comments hating on her pronunciation of "crepe"! Yes, it is not how you may pronounce the word, but that does not make it *wrong or bad* . It is simply the American English pronunciation of a French loanword. People bring words from other languages into their own all the time and pronunciation is adjusted to suit their mother tongue, and eventually it becomes common vocabulary. TACO. RAMEN. CURRY. PIZZA. All originally words from other languages that are now common words in not just American English, but many other languages around the world as well! So don't hate! Appreciate the sharing of cultures <3
❤❤❤*RIE*❤❤❤
Is it weird that I like her more now that I know she is gay?
A ganache is actually a sort whipped cream we put inside of pastries like éclairs au chocolat, for exemple. What you did to top the crêpes cake is a Glacage, not a ganache ^^
Why you act so stupid??
Why is there a blur at 12:08 ?? hhaha
Andrew is not there why
I love Rie!
Love these XD
worth it crepes!!
lol niki is lesbian
It's so heartwarming to hear her say "I can call my wife"
herrrr wife?😐
Ganache used to mean dumb in the "old school" french. Legend says that the guy who "discovered" the ganache did it by pouring by mistake hot cream over chocolate, and his chef insulted him using that particular word. When he tasted the mix, the chef realized how tasty it is and named the mix accordingly: "La ganache"
Hungryyyyy now
what is it being blurred on the finished cake??
Rie looks like the lady who helped mr incredibles while being captured by that ice cream haired guy
*RIE IS SO CUTEEEEE*
12:09 why is the left side of the cake censored?
Bless thee.
Ganache is french for fool  Ganache was created when an apprentice at a bakery in France added to much milk in chocolate and his boss called him a fool but it tasted really good so they ended up calling it ganache
Ahhh the nicest thing is to watch about food while fasting
You need more flour bro
Is she lesbian?
Wait... she had a wwiifffee???!!!!!
12:12 - Onions have layers, Ogres have layers, *Crepe cakes have layers....*
She is lesbian?
Jesus, this video is soo frustrating.
Great
Ew
Did they have to censor something at 12:08 ???
The reason it wouldn’t cook properly is bc the one top is crap and isolates the heat to the middle
5:40 the pan color change- TADDA!!!
This Is so cute
Bruh tasty credited theirselves
Nikis wife?
Nice
Rie😍
Those first crepes make me cry 😟
the censored crepe dick
I honestly just find her immature and unprofessional
this video showed me that Rie is damn funny XD
why is Rie so cute?
3:45 That's because the heat and heat distribution of the Tasty cooktop is shit
That's why your crepes will stick to the pan, girl. Put melted butter in the batter
how does rie always know what to do
Nikki was it  I like her cooking because  SHES SO FUNNY and talented like rea
i love this series so much !!!!
I'm a single grain of rice.
this crepe cake looks tasty :9
Diabetes is near
rie looks like  mirage from the incredibles 1
It is not cooking fully because of the crappy tool you are using to cook it.
I want to make this for my birthday cuz i know nobody else in my family would put this much time and effort
No tea no shade I love her but nobody outside of France can say crêpe correctly
It just goes to show you, nobody gets it perfect the first time.
Thicc
Niki what happened to your finger?
Nom nom nom 😋
Umm? Are they trying to remove David out of bussiness? Lol.
Exited when I found out she was lesbian. Disgusting
i tried making this cake 3 times, all failed
niki: we had brunch together! rie: you were there?  .... my life with every person ever.
niki has a wife!!!!!!!!
Now this is just Tasty remaking their own recipes but with Andrew and Niki EDIT: oh i thought it was the fudge chocolate crepe
Rie to the RIEscue!! lol but seriously, Rie rocks. 😍😍😍
I died inside when she said *_crayp_*
It gave me anxiety on how much bowls and everything they're using 😂😂😂 who's gonna do the dishes?! 😅😅😅
My life is for Andrew 😘😘
You are a lesbian? I didn't know you are a lesbian. You didn't look like a lesbian😕🙃
*No Lumps*
Wait she is lesbian! Cool
Ganache means what they are doing 😅 it's just the word for it in French, I don't think it has another meaning
I see Niki I click!
"Creyps"
damn that actually looks really good
adopt me pls. I want to eat good foods everyday!
12:58 look at Rie's face i cant!!!
Bitch it's pronounced "crep" not "crape"
I need to try and recreate this and a matcha flavored cake, cuz the Lady M slices are $8 here in NY. 😟 Might be easier to buy tho after watching this. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Is nikki a lesbian?  😅
Why so many chinese people?
Cream watch... Chicken Watch's family
DAVID SEYMOUR!!! Plz make!!
This is Cat from  Brooklyn NY!🐱   YO! NIKI! I hope you brought a slice home to your wife! Next time make cannolis! You did a really good job! Thank you so much! It looked so TASTY!🍰🍫🎂☕ 🌼🍎🗽🐅💖☄☮🐱
Didn't they already make a crepe cake in one of the videos
She's lesbian boo
Pretty chef....
Now i want some crepe cake 😪
10:06  A wild Adam appears
I want that MAH gahh
Q1
Stop saying crape u uneducated Americans! at least learn the pronunciation of a word when u make a video about it... it’s Crêpe and not crape! Thank u
i did one before and failed because the frosting tastes like soap 😭
can I have rie recipe pleaseeeeee?? :))
it is me or u guys making mistake on propose ?
It's not your batter Niki, the one-top induction only heats up the centre and not the sides of the pan
Her wife??!? WTF?!?
YES, it looks so good 👌🏻
4:37 🤣 m*****FUDGErrrrr 😂😂😂❤️
ITS THE EXPIRED MILK
i did not think that Niki was gay
You made me unsubscribe because of your ugly face in tumnail
I'm from Argentina and this are just regular pancakes for us
Fasting and watching food videos<<< 😭😭
12:04 High five fail 🖐
the tasty onetop she was using heats more in the middle
Love u guys. Hello from morocco. Love u guys. U r the best
im fasting why I'm I watching this :(
God I love Andrew
she lesbian?
rie is so precious i stan
More of these vids please. I never knew I needed these in my life... but now... they are a need. Not a want. And pretty sure this foursome (with Andrew) are a super crew.
nikkis wife? ⊙_⊙
Waiting for all the comments about Andrew licking his lips..
12:09 part of the crepe cake is blurred out hahahaha
How Americans say crepe Americans : Creye pse How Asian say crepe Asians : Crep
i am inlove with rie😍
Am i the only one who thinks Rie is so beautiful? Ommoo~ so pretty!! Same with nikki
Is niki lesbian
at is not an expiration date it is a best by date which means it will taste best and when used as an ingredient it will work best if used on or before that date. It is still good to drink and/or use for another week maybe even two (but much less likely) after the date on it.
OMG I love Rie <3 she's so cute!
When she brought out multiple burner, reminded me of Shokugeki no soma when yukihira cooked like 10 omelettes at the same time for 30 minutes straight 😂
Niki is hilarious but always makes amazing stuff lol
Is that the tomboy girl from those Buzzfeed videos?
Who else is watching this and fasting 😭😫🤤🤤
I love Rie's reaction to that d*ck crepe on the side 😂😂😂
4:37 whhaaa😂😂😂🤣🤣 'M.....'🤣
her wife ?! oh god😖
Anyone else notice when they show a shot of the cake at the end after they cut it they like pixalated out a section of the side on the left
I love this series so much. Theyre so fun to watch! Keep up the good work! Thanks!
i want to marry rie
What is that pronanciation
Btw your supposed to have butter in a ganache.
Rie reminds me of cooking mama
Why is Rie so good at cooking?
Her expression when her fingers are hot is literally ME
These are my favorite videos from tasty
Nikki just behaved like NED!!!!!!! SHE CALLED HER WIFE! omg💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
i pray that you people go to the netherlands at some point just to see the glory that is dutch pancakes
5:49 "And where has that gotten u" 😂
Oh how many attempts 😝but finally look yummy
Americans can't fucking cook for their lives.
I wonder at the 'hiring criteria' of the Tasty HR  Department.  Are the criteria 'must have a pulse' and 'have too much time on their hands' or 'with the ability to come up with fiddly, time consuming methods' for displaying/serving food.  Because they come up with a million & one ways to fanny about with....... using boxed cake mix/brownie mix & ready rolled puff pastry/pizza dough or worse Oreo Cookies, but ask them to cook real food and you get the equivalent of Mr Bean with the culinary knowledge of a 5 yr old.  Just bloody irritating !!
Where’s andrew
the end card is so cute!!!!
Yo homebaker's experience here: resting crepe batter is important so the gluten strands in the batter can relax and not make the crepes chewy. Also, resting the batter allows the dry ingredients to fully hydrate; if you cooked the batter right away it'd be like cooking eggs on very very low heat (too liquidy and no structure).
Oh sheesss lesbian
I love these oh my god
Why is this on tasty , it isn’t satisfying lol
Where is Andrew?!
not gonna lie I can't be a tasty cook or I'll just burn up everything and run hot
There is problem with the stove
The problem is not the coco powder, it's that shitty Tasty hot plate.
Rie's so cute😍😍😍😍
Where's David?
The way you say crepe is pretty Crape-y
The Crêpes didn't cook so well, is because the Onetop is a bad product
The reason why the middle cooks first is that that tasty hot plate is not heating up everywhere simultaneously
Good job niki i love it❤
👌👌👌
I feel like Rie is their superhero
Try without buttering the pan
"in case i can't think this, my friend Rie will help me"  Rie: (put sunglasses) whaddup bro
Its too thicc
Is this a podcast ?
Am i the only one who cries when adam yelling "huhh!!!!" in the beginning of the video 😂😂😂
i got anxiety just watching this
id never eat this bc like damn the sugar content would like hurt
0:55 Why does her smile look so aggressive? Lmao
i feel like Rie doesn't want to be in this video.
Where's Andrew?
Love this series 💕
Yas
YA INDUCTION COOKTOP IS SHIT, DAS WHY.
Niki:ahhhh....mother... Fudger
Is she a lebian? Did she said wife? The one that she called is her wife? Im just curious
Niki is such a cutie 😘
Your face is not encouraging to see the video 😐😕😨
It’s because the thing where they are cooking them doesn’t get hot on the sides I saw a video where they put flour all over the surface and it only burned in the middle 🙃
Why did they blur part of the crepe cake  Nvm I saw the penis
Idk why the Tasty original version looks better.
I loved Andrew peeping through the door 😍😍😍😍😂😂😂
when i saw andrew take a bite of that crepe cake i kinda expected him to say "oh yes"
I like this show, but I don’t get the point of recreating a recipe from their own channel? They already have two videos on tasty about making crepe cakes...
12:04 their high five lmao
Lolo
it's crepe not crapes
Craaaype. Nice pronunciation Nikki
*M O R E  P L E A S E*
Is this the same sexist bigot Niki that was on buzzfeed's "36 questions women have for men" video?
"It might be the cocoa powder"  yas nikki blame it to the cocoa powder. Lmao
Кто то из России есть?
19k views in 47 minutes
I think this is the best series that Buzzfeed ever made
Welcome to 'Adam wants fancy food and forces his friends to try and make it!'
Omg one day past the date...... Dairy products tend to last 2 weeks after expired...
Niki!!! Where's that TALL drink glass of water called Garret?!
Rie is so pretty
There making a video about making one of their other videos, dafuk?
Rie is just perfect ain’t she 🙄
I can’t watch this if she keeps saying crepe wrong 😱🙄
Have you guys ever made a galaxy mirror Crepe cake??
Do I prounouce crêpe wrong?
The hot plate sucks
Rie saying she doesn't remember eating crepes with nikki is gold
This is my favorite Buzzfeed show !
I love it when rie is always there to save everyone 😍😍😍
I wish Andrew and Nikki were together than it would be more hilarious
Niki's lesbian?
Ganache= Donkey  In France someone put Hot Milk with chocolate and the Chef called him Donkey, But in the End he still likes this idea.
Crepe cakes are overrated af.
Her voice is so cute.
Wait Niki is lesbian? Because she called her wife and literally she is a lesbian
Lmao they credited themselves for the footage
why the blur at 12:08
Isn't Whole milk blue Or is that just in the UK? 1:10.
Nikki is elizbien
The main point of this series is that you always need Rie's help.
Why am I watching this when I'm fasting?? It's making me hungry and I've still got 4 hours to go😭😭
release another homebuddies season, niki
This recipe was O-cake
CRAEPS ???
That penis crêpe tho🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭
Idl her.
I think the problem is with the stove you use
Not her fault the way the crepes were cooking-- the Tasty induction cookers have really uneven heating
Anyone else thinks Rie super cute
Love this
why censor penis?
Nice.
What is the difference between crepes and pancakes?
Is that cameraman Adam from WORTH IT?
I love Rie !
I​ love how they blurred it out on 12:08
Ooh.. My Faves in one Video.
This is the best Buzzfeed Season after Worth-It....
I never saw a crepe batter that much liquid
there is sugar in the chocolate** lol nikki
She’s so awkward - basically me but I’m like 100000000x worse
🤤
Omg looks so yum
Made a crepe cake for my friend and her mother's birthday two years back and it was an absolute hit! Definitely would suggest you try. Isn't as cumbersome as this video really :p But Nikki is absolutely adorable
Nikki's looked nicer than the original tasty video.
Niki is great, like seriously. Please make more videos with her in it!
This should be called Cooking with Rie
I didn't know nicki was married
Mmmmm looks sooooo good! I'd love to eat that cake! *heart eyes*  According to the French Wikipedia and its source the book 'Pierre Hermé, Le grand livre du chocolat : 380 recettes, Vevey, Mondo, 2007', the word "ganache" came from a mistake made by an apprentice chocolatier who dropped boiling cream in chocolate. His master immediately called him a "ganache", which meant "idiot" or "half-witted" back then. But when they discovered that what the apprentice had done was definitely edible, they called the sauce "ganache". But according to the ENGLISH Wikipedia and its source the 'Oxford English Dictionary', the name has its origins in a vaudeville from the 1860s.   Soooooo... what gives?
So niki is lesbian?
"Not to toot my own horn, I'm pretty good at making crepes"     I can see that
All of your videos are always so funny! I had to laugh so much this time 😂
Wait nikkie has a wife😲😲 Did they meant friend or sister mother ...... But wifeeeee
Getting really frustrated over the fact that ya'll are using a regular pan for making crepes. There are special pans for making crepes, and it makes the job so much easier!
her facial expression is so entertaining
What a load of crepe..... *grabs coat*
loveee this series!
Your crepes failed because you're using your Chinese built Tasty cooking plate that barely gets hot enough, which has been proven by several testers.  That, plus you're using a giant fucking pan, you're supposed to use a special crepe pan which is way lower, thus making it way easier to scoop up and turn your crepe with your palette knife...
you know why she said that its still wet on the outside? because she is using their own portable stove, which is no so great to be using except for "Instagram" looking. The problem is because the heating area is only on the middle and its creating a Circle instead of the whole surface heating up together. (Prove me wrong if you find it). Watch people reacts to the Buzzfeed Tasty Stove-thing on the youtube and you will know why.
The editing in this video just makes it so much more funnier than it already is 😂
Crepe cake😃😃😃
This was so satisfying!
David Seymour
Demandez aux bretons :')
😄😄😄😄
*TASTY*
but the chocolate ganache is soooooo much gooooooooooooooooood
Really tasty
This whole time I watch niki cook I realized she lesbian
I think it also look better without icing sugar
I LUV THIS SERIES I LUV NIKI
Love this video!!! Great job!!
Niki is so iconic I love her
THATS IT IM SUBSCRIBEING
Make more video with people in it not Just foods. Please 😍😁
Damn can we all press F to pay respects for andrew
Wondering why there need to be blur out a part of the cake on 12:09 ? But then watch until the end~ Hahaha
Love this show
I thought nikki's best friend is garret :(
ADAAAAAAM ❤
Niki:"There's a *****" Andrew:"Excuse me?" Ohhh that was so good XD
The way Americans pronounce foreign words make me wanna kill myself
Is Niki lesbian?
I'm one of the first 1,000!!!
Eat my feed ;)
.....i thgt itwas Rhea ...not Rie
1:05 Im not alone :D
still did a better job than me tbh
Can we please have a crepe watch 2k18?!
Shes having a lot of fun...
Shes got a WIFE? Excuse me but's that awesome.
That looks amazing.
it's called crêpe not crape :/
With the milk expiration date, its typically good for about a day or 2 after expiration, atleast thats ny experience. Any longer than that and it starts to smell and/or get clumpy/nasty
Who else is here before 1 minute
*maybe it would be better if they ate it like how they ate anything with their cheese sauce*
Nikki has wife.i think she has husband
I like Niki and Rie together! more of them please!
I ❤ chocolate cakes and this looks yummy. Thanks Tasty i'll try this one day 😘
welcome to eating your feet
Rie must laugh so much at their fails
Wanna hear a pun?       Niki isn’t CREPEY at making crepes AHAHAHAHAHA I AM HILARIOUS RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
Andrew: Is there a pea under the cake? Niki: There's a penis under the cake. Andrew: Excuse me?! *Dead*
her pan might be too hot
Just do the recipe it is not a comedy show not funny at all
"egg juice"?
The date on the milk is a sell by date. Duh
I love the fact that Rie puts away the Tasty whisk for a proper one.  That was pretty much my reaction when I first saw them at my local Walmart.
wheres andrew?
Great job
CRAPE
drinking game: take a shot every time niki says ‘ow’
The first attempt was bad coz of the bad Tasty hotplate
looks better imo
Is niki gay
Hey Tasty! Great video, I love your channel!
I just got a great idea for a baby shower dessert 🍰 thanks guys😋
Crepe's is just called pancakes in Denmark
Her face is so punchable but yet she's so nice.
Rie's laugh at 12:58 haha! adorable!
10:30 andrew
10:30 andrew
It's the stove. Tasty stove only heats in the centre
the problem is the "tasty hot plate"
Is niki lesbian?
Crep not crape😡😡
Who does the dishes?
Is Niki a Lesbian ?
13:02 the princess and the penis
Where is home buddies
Early!
Rie is basically the supervisor and Niki and Andrew are inexperienced children just learning to cook😂😂 but they’re still amazing at it way better than me
Americans pronounce the word crêpe really weird
10:06 Pause here for a Secret Adam!
Anybody living in England but from Trinidad?☹️🇹🇹🇬🇧
Is Niki a lesbian?
yall bleeped "penis"?
Why does her pronunciation sound like creep and not crêpe
I like how these vids show how hard it actually is
gay
Love you Niki you are so fun to watch❤ second fave series on buzzfeed❤
THIS VIDEO WAS *CREPE*    Get it? Okay I’ll leave
Make something with Kelsie!!!
Yummy🤤🤤🤤
Her wife?
The way your wife has got your back..... 👏👏👏
Rie is Tasty Mom
Yay I'm early #EarlySquad ...btw nice recipe ...love it sure to try some ...😍😘💗😉😄
“That’s such a *thicc* later”
I would like to watch a cook-off between Rie & Claire
I like Rie!
She gave really good directions, like explaining why she uses and does what she does while making the recipe. I like this. More please :)
If she made them little bit thicker it would flip easier
Rie you should have your own channel :D
"crape"
Hello 2018
Rie is like the best Tasty Mama. Making sure you dont mess up cooking XD
That was pretty neat
Anybody from India ???

Hey guys does anyone realize that pro player dosent come anymore
Tbh, me as a guy, this thing is easy to done but it take a lot of time tbh! That's why it's quite costly not because the ingredients but the amount of patience taken to complete the cake :)
