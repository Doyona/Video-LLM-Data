Good crunchy taste🎉
Someone edited this. No salt? Pepper?! This is a short version. I saw the original once...
Scruffy unattractive
Excellent helpful and thanks it was yummy
What happened to the  bay leaf?
🥰😍🥰🥰😍🥰🥰😍🥰🥰😍✨✨✨✨🎉🎉🎉🎉🤤😅🥂🥂🐾🌻
I’d add some lemon zest for a surprising tingle in every morsel!
I like to add a few crispy bacon bits. Delicious
Delicious and tasty! Totally a must! congratulations!
Trying this tonight.
Great recipe! Looks nice! Thanks for sharing! 👍👍👍
…I know that Brits are a lot more loosey-goosey with cooking measurements than Americans, but you can’t just say “two tablespoons” and then use well over half a cup…
excellent liked it very much! also gives permission to experiment, using cauliflower leaves or spinich or kale, instead of bread usign breadcrumbs and instead of almond crashed wallnuts, once red chillies etccc.....
That's me fecked - I've no blender.
The best !
was quite igood/blending broccali genius...but don't be fooled folks...froen cauliflower does not equal fresh...in both tase and consistency
Fanks Jamie
Thankyou Jaime, another successfully guided and gleaned meal in the oven for a lazy Sunday
Thanks a lot! Cooked it and liked it)
This was great. Brilliant with the broccoli béchamel, to which I added grated cheddar, salt and pepper. I only made one change, but that has to do with taste. I baked the gratin for 30 min instead of an hour. The cauliflower was tender but had a bite to it (was concerned one hour would turn it too mushy). In any case, this is a keeper. Well done, Jamie!
You are sooooooooo good Jamie ! You make cooking actually look like fun! See me in Dr.Who's Tardis, I am a huge Brit Fan, but what is a nob of butter pls?
No seasoning ?????? 🙄
amazing
This was amazing! I also addEd onion powder and vegeta to white sauce and mixed herbs to crumb topping. So delicious and it was very sweet too! Everyone enjoyed this dish👌🏾
40mins is enough, include some cheese in the sauce in addition to grated cheese on top, then you are good to go
Delicious! Thank you Jamie
I made this around a month ago and boy was it yummy. I'm going to make this for Christmas day :)
Indeed epic
Brilliant! Made this several times, thank you Jamie.
You don’t need all those carb to make Cauliflower or broccoli gratin mate . Use cream-cheese or sour cream and cheese you get the same result with out so much curb 😏
What's brockly?
Warning: remove bay leaf before blitzing
Have you consider adding some keto recipes? Keto followers are increasing in numbers these days.
yum yum... sooooo inspiring Jamie... Thank youu
Still hate Jamie Oliver for the sugar tax in  the U.K. and ruining my school dinners as a kid!
Oliver your are so funny....  a British dish? Never seen a British restaurant !!!!
Where's the cheese??🤔
Looks ok, but not that great...Lots thinks missing there, like solt, pepper etc, his sister i dont like in a kitchen  with untidy cover up long hair.... you probably can find in some dish..my opinion not that wonderful ...
How to take two superfoods and make them super unhealthy.
He’s such a twat
I don't know whats worse, the horrible looking crusty cauliflower cheese, or the fact that its served in a flower pot.
Why does he always have to serve food in a bowl that looks likes it was found at the back of a garden shed? He'll be serving up pasta in an old tin bucket soon!
We don't love you, too much advertising. Greedy Jamie, shame on you.
Thank you very much.

Idk y but my teacher gave me this to watch, hi 6H
Nice & Thanks :)
Is there a way to separate the brocoli from the cauli once the sauce is made? i.e. as opposed to straight cheddar?
It taste absolutely yummy. Tq for the recipe
I gave it a bash and it was ok. I do agree that cheese must be incorporated into the sauce .otherwise it was great.
🧀🧀🧀
Wished you rather promote fresh and local ingredients that would also reduce the amount of plastic waste. However,  the recipe looks delicious as always *.*
Would you like to be my brother? 😒
Serves how many people?
No bread for me as it’s to carby  Other than that it’s good to go
I am so doing this but with cheese in the bechemel sauce as well as on top with paprika and black cracked pepper. 😘
Get your measurements right moron...you put in about 1 cup of flower...not 2 tablespoons. Very misleading.
the Cauliflower needs to be par-boiled before putting in the dish - mine was in the oven for 40 mins and the Cauliflower was still completely raw
👌👌👌👌
I must have missed the “cheese” part
This looks amazing!!!! Thanks so much for sharing 💞
YUMMY 😋 WOW! THANKS YOU GOODNESS 🌟🌟🌟,♥️🖤💚 BROWN FAMILY DAPHNE COTTON ALWAYS 💜 AWESOME BEAUTIFUL 💯.♥️ BLOOD,🖤 AFRICAN,💚 HOPE,
The thumbnail looks like doodoo
Just made this...it's delicious and will definitely be a winter go-to dish.
Lovely to watch. The recipe is in the oven but no mention of cooking times. I allowed 15 minutes for the cauliflower at 200 degrees and then mixed in the other ingredients for a further 15 minutes.. Cannot wait to eat lunch.
Jamie is a very nice cooker, love it, from france ;)
Bonsoir Jamie merci pour ces superbes vidéos
This recipe looks great! I'm definitely going to try it.
😋😋😋
basically both veggie can be eaten raw, why bake for 1 hour?
where is the cheese in the cauliflower cheese of Jamie?
As usual, Jamie comes up with some amazing ideas.
Such a talented chef, I'm so excited that I found him!!
Both great recipes but I use single cream instead of milk. Parmesian and cheddar for a super cheesy taste. I don't steam or par cook cauliflower. Bake 60 min covered then 20 min uncovered. It will blow your mind it's that good!.
It’s my dinner tonight. Tastes pretty good.
I use the stems from Kale rather that broccoli  it's awesome
I cant cook 2 save my life,try this it turnd out great....
I could just swim in it, it's that gooood. Yum! ❤😋
My dad made this for me  Holy moly it was delicious 😋
Go vegans!!!! We made a plant based vegan mexican lasagna and it was deliscious! We were eating it like it had msg, it was that good! I used coconutoil/cashew cheese, with a taco spiced tomato sauce mixed in every layer:  refried beans, corn, and rice with sauteed onions....turned out absolutely delish! With the last layer on top only the cheese..
Just what I was looking for.
thanks Jamie... always fresh. always inspiring. keep making us smile..your the best...!!
I do keto cauliflower cheese. Take out the flour and add double cream and add cheese to the sauce. Yumm. I like the broccoli being mixed up in the sauce though as extra nutrition. Will try it.
You gain more from growing your own.
It's a veg. gratin in a way. Don't forget to add a bit of nutmeg on the top. Very warm on any bachamel sauce 😍
80 pence for a sachet of Colemans... saves all the messing around
Where is the cheese?
4:56
Gonna make this with almond milk, and veg butter
Ok
his is one of my favourite Jamie-recipes :) doing it again today but instead of broccoli, I've used leftover chicken meat. I think it will be as awesome as the original :)
Jamie is so happy. My personal healthy routine to smile is, first thing in the morning, start the day with one of his videos
I tried this last night for dinner. It was lovely but lacked the creamy cheesy flavour in the dish that cauliflower cheese usually has. Then it dawned on me, the cheese wasn't added to the sauce. It was placed on top. I'm gonna try it again but put the cheese in the sauce so it's cheesy throughout. I also put a bit of pepper in the sauce and smoked paprika and paprika on the top before the breadcrumbs.
Very  nice  thanks
Fantastic way to sneak in the veggies for kids ❤️
I only saw 1 knob in that video
Greek girls rule baby
Needs way more cheese for my liking.
WHY DOES HE ALWAYS YELL SO LOUD IN THE INTRO
Oh and cauliflower cheese!
I have come to the conclusion that white people don't like seasoning much in their food.
There is too much sauce, i had my cauliflower overcooked and too mooshy also its very heavy and not as flavourful as i would like it to be 😭 maybe i did something wrong idk
Tried this tonight. ... came out delicious!
Omg!!! This looks amazing, can't wait to try this :)
simmer the broccoli for 20 minutes? the heck
Can this dish be made in advance and the reheated? It looks absolutely delish!!
10 k hitted the wrong button by accident or they are female and are sure Jamie Oily liver loves them back , the other half just never cooked before LOL, btw Oliver , I subscribed to your channel but all there is ? a good tvface and my own mistake by subscribing , I'm removing this channel due to having seen too much of rubbish and probably its to blame on the ones that have hired you in , or you on your own are destroying your carriere , or this just has to do with Brittain , I don't know what it is but if I were u ? I'd suggest to find a better agency/ manager ! or simply get urself back 2gether becoz it sux , sorry , done with this , sad because liked watching YOU busy , like I said a good tv face , nothing more nor less :((
Looks so delicious 😋  I wish cauliflower was a little cheaper. Never get enough
I love looking at recipes on YouTube.....I watch a lot of people some way better than others doing the same thing, the you come along and blow them all out of the water.....thanx once again.....
Omg who knows the name of the greek sister cooking with Jamie? She is stunning. Does she have a cooking channel?
Oh Jamie.... you tease!
Who would 'dislike' this? Lol.
Your Greek sister is hot.
Very KETO!
Thanks Jamie. Looks wonderful. I always prided myself on my version, but this is truly next level! One could also add some chopped ham into the Bechamel sauce for a slight variation in flavour methinks.
I could totally VEGANIZE this recipe!!! thanks :)
Freezing kills live enzymes
I would prefer to try the recipe using fresh cauliflower.
worth. The time to do. Did this for Sunday lunch got 4 thumbs up.
Is that sister adopted or.......
what is the temperature that needs to be set for baking this?
i was like "Has Jamie gone vegan?" lol
Bashamil sauce is an Egyptian sauce.
Love this but wished i had an army of folks to help me in the kitchen too!
go to a DENTIST
Loved the Technics! Thank you!
just made this tonight ..... heart attack city .............. used 100 g of cheese 40g of butter full milk ...... was amazing/ Good  but i can feel my heart saying " you dont want to live past 60 do you ? " its all well good  if you have the time to shop / prepare/ in takes 10 min  / wash the dishes after / do the extra sports to take the pounds off !!
Fattening!!!!!!!!!!
for now i am taking that broccoli sauce with addition of... lil salt pepper [and lime if needed]... for my sandwiches  ;) . i am real fan of sauces n chutneys. then may be next weekend ll try this recipe too... n thnx... i remember how he said in Christmas video that her sister cooks a great cauliflower cheese... n i was thinking how to make that like her,,, hehe. thnx .
in terms of quality plus heath, I think fresh beats frozen.
I tried it and it was delicious.My husband loved it😝
I would argue it is the consistency of a lot of frozen veg that lets it down. I think this would be the give away in a taste comparison.
I just love this guy and the British way of saying things, "two nobs of butta"
never knew such a dish excited! looking forward to trying this
hola qui tal mauchas gracias por las buenas recetas.besssssos.
I love cauliflower, but I usually just fry it in a pan with flour egg breadcrumbs crust and it is delicious, but this is something new to try.
One minute frozen stuff is not right, then they say it's just the same.  But which is better?!?!?      FIGHT !!!
damn. looks nice
نرجوا ان تترجم الى اللغه العربيه وشكرا
Always good to freeze leftover veggies instead of letting them spoil. It's actually more nutritious than letting them degrade in the fridge as you stop the spoiling process when they are at their freshest. Just can't eat them raw, which is best, unfortunately as they turn mushy when defrosted. Always cook from frozen. :)
I always thought buying frozen would be more expensive? As you pay for the convenience of not having to slice and dice your veggies.  Very interesting..  Must try this as it looks so awesome...
Instead of broccoli, can I use zucchini ?!
Fuck frozen broccolli fresh is still where it's at
love it
no salt nor pepper?does cheddar bring enough salt?
i luv that recipe..
seriously Jamie, slow down enough to give portions,  oven temp, measures in Ounces for Americans...........
I am a vegetarian. .n love Jamie Oliver recipes.
Perfect main dish :)
fucking pric
what do you serve this with?
Jaime Oliver has to be the most pretentious celeb chef out there honestly what I pile of  best ever shit!  salt and pepper Jaime believe it or not goes a long way and your over priced  italian restaurants are a disgrace and insult to italians. I I hope your pissed of you'd have every right to be pissed off because I would be pissed off it I served that shit too!
would be perfect with leftover white meat chicken or turkey chunks mixed in.
Huh...back in Sydney where I used to live, fresh broccoli were cheaper than the frozen ones in per gram basis(and bok choi, etc) so we end up buying the fresh ones, washing them, blanching them, lightly season, and freeze them in small portion sizes. Since me and my room mate both went to engineering uni, so it was a great method to stock on vegetables without having to go shop frequently.
GOOD RECIPE BUT FIRST TIME I MADE THIS IT WAS LACKING SEASONING. NEXT TIME I ADDED SOME SALT AND PEPPER!
i added a table spoon of jizz to the sauce for extra flavour and body!worked really well my family loved it! :)
What a cop out
I love Jamie Oliver's recipes and have most of his books. But this recipe is absolutely disgusting. The vegetables are tasteless and watery, and making a broccoli sauce in this way is a very poor idea. Pay the extra 80p and get real food.
Is it ok if I use gluten-free flour for the white sauce?
Looks amazing.
Jamie o io cucino come te o tu cucini come me.........?...?????
anyone find that pan on ebay? im sure its somewhere on these comments. cbf reading
To the kilo flower recipy
Does jimmy oliver forgot salt and peper
Made the fresh version, family loved it.
So the Cauliflower goes in the oven, frozen?  You don't have to thaw it or cook it in boiling water before or anything?
Both versions look great :D But here in Germany, fresh cauliflower isn't even more expensive than frozen, I believe, I mean cauliflower is pretty cheap in general..
no salt? no pepper at all?
Seriously folks, stock up on frozen veg, it's not cheap because it lacks flavour or nutrition, it's cheap because it simply lasts longer. For the naturalists who insist otherwise, remember, broccoli, cauliflower, sprouts etc. DID NOT OCCUR IN NATURE. We evolved them from the mustard flower and created them through artificial selection. They wouldn't exist were it not for man made processes. Also, remember neolithic man? Those folks who covered 10 miles a day, and ate 100% organic food, and lived to the ripe old age of 35? -_-
What temperature for baking cauliflower cheese for one hour?
what is a good subtitute for the butter if im vegan?
What an amazing dish, obviously it was Jamie Oliver!
Calm down
http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/jamie-oliver-twist-sleeping-enemy-11  Jamie why do you promote gmo and Bill Gates who supports the biotech company Monsanto.
I can't wait to make this for my family, but I am severly allergic with any type of hard cheese,so what other cheese can be used other than chedder? thanks so much for the wonderful reciepe.
Remember if you're using fresh cauliflower or broccoli it just needs boiling for 8mins and roasting for 5-10.
I love and understand the notion of you promoting food to be cheap, especially in hard times, but I do feel as though this is a little bit 'having your bread buttered on both sides', excuse the pun. For someone to be such an outspoken and successful campaigner for fresh food (particularly veg) then I don't understand why you'd clearly favour the opposite - the the point of directly comparing the two next to each other. I'd have thought, particularly considering how staunchly pro fresh food you are, that your conclusion to this could have been more along the lines of "the frozen one is great - considering it costs half as much - but not as tasty nor good for you as the fresh one, which is great if you can afford that".
You forgot salt and pepper.... Pffff
Lets do a vegan Cauliflower Cheese together! :)
Shokugeki?
Well you don't have that much nutrients in frozen veggies
Making this tonight!
Soooooooooooooo delicious!!!!!!!!!!!
Sourdough bread, artisan cheese,almond flake... these are not cheap, in Australia at least. But it's delicious though.
frozen vs fresh, it's the nutrition value that matters
Thanks for the recipe Jamie! The Best Cauliflower Cheese is baking in my oven as we speak. My fiancé loves this, so I'm waiting for her to come back to surprise her with your version! Appreciate what you've been doing cooking up great food and sharing it with the world.
Is this a cooking channel or a frozen food promoting channel?
i need some cauliflower
Fabulous recipie thank-you mmmm
Gave it a try and it was at least 10 times better then I expected! Thanks a bunch!
I tried this instead of my usual bechamel sauce with cheese and a little english mustard, and I have to say it just was not as nice. I may try it again and put the cheese into the sauce rather than just grating it over the top to give it more flavour.
im drooling right now !
How much is a nob of butter? 1 teaspoon?
I just tried it.  Used a roasted garlic bread I had and walnuts instead of almonds (what I had in the cupboard).   Came out delish!  My vegetarian daughter loved it with some fresh fruit for dinner!!
With the fresh you get to use all the green bits, which are just as tasty.
Looking for a $   vs   $   comparison..   for all ingredients and time and energy
In México frozen Veg are more expensive than fresh ones, i'll try it !
I love this sorts of food xx
Does anyone know the kind of pan Jamie is using in this video?
Cheddar cheese is.. Grate. Haaah. Ha. Sorry -.-
bloody gorgeous!!!! Thanks Jamie.x
I'm going to cook it, for sure :)
i did not know that the briticunts have food..i always thought that your best food is rotten cheese with shit!!!
I made this yesterday for my family and it was amazing! Thank you for this great recipe and for showing me that frozen vegetables can be really tasty as well! :)
I'm probably the only moron who forgot to add salt and pepper :( I'm sooooo bummed!
What an amazing idea I am going to make this tonight my husband loves this kind of a dish. Thanks for this great tip
Good job Jamie & crew ! I have been wanting to see TV CHEFS humble down & tackle the food ingredients that most of us have to buy,... I live in an area where all I can buy (but won't) is Farm Raised Chinese Seafood & the frozen veg is sadly better than the wilted sh** in the Produce section. It gets a bit much to constantly see Chefs on TV telling us to visit our Fish Monger or Butcher or local Farmer when a lot of us, because of where we live or our economic situation, have only the Mega Mart to shop at,... We don't all earn $400k per year & live in NYC or on a CA Beach. Very smart to get people eating frozen veg instead of none at all ;)
Wow two wonderful versions of this classic, I like the version with fresh cauliflower, but that has little time and leads a busy life and need a comfortable food after an intense day of work, the version with cauliflower frozen falls nicely. Thank you *****  for sharing with us!
yummy looks so good Jamie
Oh I'll have to try that almond trick, yum yum. Good job Jam!
Jamie Oliver hey i remember one crazy bread dish you made with the grape, rosemary, oliveoil, and some icing sugar. I would love to see some of the recipe back in the oliver twist days!
yum!! this looks so good. I'm making it tomorrow!!
Save with Jamie! I miss that show..
Can I freeze the finished product for later?
Looks amazing!
But could I use hemp milk instead of regular milk? I'll let you know!!!!!
I AM GOING TO MAKE THIS RIGHT NOW!!! I just need to find some cheese :D
i just need to get caserole casserole dish and i will make it a saturday lunch. Thanks +Jamie Oliver
I can´t wait to try it!
Love this man!!
Oh yum
Definetly giving this a go, can't wait to give my new food processor a whiz!
I loved the JMSM series!! <3 Great recipe.
made this dish for dinner and is so nice! I'm so happy that I have enough for my lunch tomorrow maybe with some potatoes...thank you so much for your delicious and easy recipes
Wouldn't frozen cauliflower make this super watery?
This looks so delicious!  I cannot wait to try this!
Love that dish! I just posted the recipe for Cauliflower buffalo wings for healthy march madness snacks. Such a versatile Veg :
They are hardly gonna say that its shit
I wish my daddy was Jamie Oliver(not just because of his cooking)
OMG I CANT BELIVE YOU HAVE 4 MILLION DOLLAR :O
that looks amazing! ...tomorrow's dinner, thank you! :D
Yum!
now it's really warm in Israel so the cauliflowers have worms...I cant work with it...
I just made this, OMG...amazing!!! Thank you Jamie :)))🙌
Jamie! You get an A on this one! I love a dish that I know right away I can make and when you throw in a way to save money as well, well that's a home run for me! Looks delicious!
Gonna pretend that I belong to the Food Tube family and comment like Frenchy and Donald:  "Looks super epic, will give it a go indeed :)"
I've seen this on TV :P , Really awesome
Is this dish relatively healthy? Sorry, I know this is a stupid question but I just wanna be sure! :)
Can't get enough of roasted cauliflower these days and this looks bloomin delicious - defo going to give it a go! :)
What kind of pan did you use in the video?
That looks absolutely good
I don´t like frozen veg I think they taste horrible in comparison to fresh vegetables!
that was a fantastic video ! :)
This looks cool,
Frozen is often times healthier as well since most fruit&veg lose a lot of thier nutrients during long transportation or lying around in the store for too long.  A bit counter-intuitiv but true, sadly...
can someone let me know what is the first dish in the 'more' window at the end of the video  thanks
Where was the cheese?
i love how you make this kind of videos where you prove people wrong that just because its fresh doesnt mean it tastes better. and also people on budgets can make these kind of food which is also very nice
Haven't had cauliflower cheese since I lived with my English foster parents, who moved to Canada. Joyce was my foster mother's name. She was your stereotypical liberal British girl: liberated, beautiful, strong, and smart. She rode horses competitively and even got into bodybuilding at one point. Her cauliflower cheese was great, she never added broccoli to the sauce though, that's a smart idea. You should do stuffed marrow sometime, that stuff is fantastic...﻿
Yummy
Superb...... Big thumbs up.....👍
Wow that looks absolutely amazing!!
Jaime! Not sure if you're aware but you're inspiring many American home cooks via YouTube! Thank you. Keep it up. Also, your Snapchat is awesome, thanks Alfie Deyes!
It would have been nice to have the fresh recipe side by side. The cooking times must be different?
im gonna make this
Making this for sure!!!
A lot cheaper is a bit of an exaggeration
I love cauliflower and cheese.
Cool! Trick is not to over cook the cauliflower. ;)
I think broccoli has a peculiar flavour and that's what I enjoy about it.
That looks so delicious!  I need to get a food processor so I can make this!  Birthday is coming up too!  I'll make it for my birthday! Along with the pasta dish that was on tour channel last week!  I really want to make all this!!
Great Video Jamie - Nice Job!
can I come to your house for supper Jamie! pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Gonna make this on Tuesday after going shopping :)
he didnt add salt????
Wow! It looks amazing, Jamie! Here at home we eat almost single day couliflower and brocolis, prepared in a wok. Now I can try this version. Thanks for this recipe.
Looks lovely!  I don't know why I have an image  of Gordon Ramsey yelling about never using frozen stuff haha *o*
I can't controll the video? :D
I'm a new diabetic. Is this diabetic friendly? Any help would be wonderful, thank you.
I'll give it a try for tonight supper! Thanks!!
Another convenient way for me to eat more vegetables. :]]
Omg that looks great perfect for partys.
Requesting more recipes that can use frozen ingredients! Yay loved this. Also yummy!!
Soo good !
jamie married the wrong girl. my god ! greek beauty
Great accompaniment for family dinners! Thumbs up 👍
I'm so exciting to know that I can use frozen cauliflower to make this dish!!! Thank you Jamie xo
It looks soooo good :)
Delicious, thanks for sharing! ^_^ I love cauliflower and broccoli with cheese, and this looks like a splendid version.
Another awesome video from you Jamie! I have a few questions that I would like to have answers on!   I'm nut allergic and I wonder if there is anything that I could replace it with in general?  Also I REALLY don't like coriander but I'm really trying to like it! The boring part of those things are that its really tasty with nuts in so many dishes and coriander is so often used so.. How would you teach someone to like something?  I use to read your book
I have frozen broccoli and fresh cauliflower lol Il give this a go tomorrow because that broccoli sauce looks too good to pass up!  Can anyone recommend a small side to go with this :/  Thanks :)
Can anyone else see the face in the almonds at 1:58?
thanks for this!  i scrimp and save to buy fresh, and i needed to see something like this to take a turn down the frozen aisle.  thanks so much!  great recipe to prove the point too !!
Loved the visual text effects in this one, So props to the editor!
Super epic indeed :)
why Jamie always be adding weird stuff like Almonds
But fresh must be better for you.... no?
what i wanna know is: Is frozen vegis less healthy than fresh ones?
Please teach us the perfect peanut brittle
ima make this tomorrow!
I don't understand why Jamie advocates frozen food, I mean ok, maybe it's a little bit cheaper and has just as much flavour and nutrients, but firstly it requires much more energy: It has to be picked, cut, frozen, packaged and transported, and secondly it takes the consumer further away from the original natural product, wehreas fresh food requires less energy and brings the consumer closer to the source, which i thought Jamie was a big fan of... Great recipe nonetheless :)
i like that recipe for not needing salt or pepper
I just did it last week! Yum!
what type of pan are you using?
This looks sooo good! Definitely gonna try it out :D
Wonderful!
I am sooo going to make this soon.  I love cauliflower, I love broccoli and I love anything baked with a creamy sauce.  I adore the idea with the broccoli in the sauce, I have never heard of it before.  Sounds absolutely delicious, super easy.
Instead of broccoli also try carrots they will give an amazing sweet flavor to the white sauce. Lovely!!!
Love it! Going to give this a try as soon as possible:)   But, Jamie, how bout one pot meals? Easy and fast but delicious!
This looks so tasty! I've never had it, and I do enjoy my cauliflower! Looks very simple to make as well- will try this one out! Thanks Jamie! :D
This looks amazing never would have thought about adding broccoli to the sauce. I think ill give this a go.
0:52 That's a really big tablespoon.
Any idea about gluten free version? Or just simply do it without flour and bread?
I like the voiceover
I've made this so many times since seeing this episode on TV. It's such a hit with my kids ESP lil ones that need extra calorie intake. You've really encouraged me to use a lot of frozen veggies, which help me reduced in wastage thanks x
Amazing. Such a joy
Not enough Jamie Oliver videos on FoodTube. Not that he's lazy, just that he's great. Also, isn't it about time to give us a little Jamie & Gennaro combo action? Haven't had one of those in ages.
Welp. I know what I'm cooking tonight!
Love the addition of broccoli!!  It would be great if you could check out my channel as I'm a teenager with a passion for cooking :)
I never bought frozen cauliflower.  I will now.
could this go in a LCHF diet ?
aren't even more vitamins in the frozen veges anyways?
Stop making me hungry!! Lol just kidding but that seriously looks delicious keep up the amazing cooking skills
OMG. That looks outrageously delicious. Can't wait to make it for my kids.
Never thought to add the broccoli to the sauce, great idea.
I love a cauliflower gratin! YUM! And I make mine with frozen veg and it's delicious! Both looked yummy! TFS Jamie! :)
Delicious
cauliflower gives me bumps and rashes in places bumps and rashes should never be
looks great
Love it jamie!
awesome!!
