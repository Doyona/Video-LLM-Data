Lovely!!! I'm curious, what crate dimensions were the crates?
I made this. Thank you.

This is perfect!! You are very creative, and resourceful!!  I'm going to make one right away.  I can't help thinking you must be inspired by the greatest Carpenter of all-our Lord.
Wow, I can kick myself in the rear!!! First of all, I spent years trying to buy things that fit in certain places, taking measurements and measuring tape to the stores, 2nd I'm always in Joan's & Michael's bc I make jewelry, I almost bought a crate a 100x to hang jewelry!! Thank you, your work is beautiful and NEAT! Not exciting 'junk' that would have a few months of life in a home. Stay safe, God bless🤗

What size is the crate?
I finally made this! It looks exactly like yours and I love it ❤️ thank you
This is the best crate tutorial I've seen thanks for sharing
Beautiful. Thanks for sharing . Did you drill the holes ? Sorry I didn’t catch that part if you already explained . I did rewind several times to make that you mentioned about the holes but I didn’t hear it 🙈.
Esta bien bonito 👍 yo ise uno diferente
I’ll put wheels on it.. that way you can move it wherever you need to..
This is SOOOOO pretty and I really can see many, many uses for them.  Thank you so very much for demonstrating how to make it.  🌸🌺🌼🤗
Thank you for sharing your awesome project!!!! I can't wait to make this.God Bless
Very good idea. You did well. Cant wait to make one for me. Thanks for the idea.

Very cute, this would look nice in my farm house!
Hi sweetie my name is Elizabeth I really love your great job and beautiful ideas very helpful for every mom weren't working and really save money for us 💘 💘 💘 it and thank you si much for sharing your gorgeous idea's and God bless you sweetie.
Really Beautiful 💗
Hi, were the holes for the legs, already there in the crates, or did you make the holes, & if you did make the holes, what did you use? Thank you, awesome video & talent!
Just GORGEOUS!!!! 💜 I wouldn't put it in a small child's room, because they might try to climb up and get hurt very badly! When my boys were little, the youngest tried climbing up a narrow chest of drawers and it fell on top of him! He wasn't really hurt, but his big brother started crying and was scared he was dead! (The little one was crying loudly at the time! LOL!!!) 😉
Merci beaucoup pour votre la vidéo je suis très content de voir si très je le ❤🌹😍😘
Love love love!!
I love this so much. Thank you for sharing. I have been looking for an idea for something like this to go under our mounted TV in the living room. I will make it shorter and longer but I really think this will be awesome. Sending love your way from S.C. ❤️
Really nice and esasy to make. Thanks for the idea!!! 🤩🤩
What was the cost of the legs?? I think I would spray at least the legs before attaching. That would make the painting easier. May I suggest one secure it to the wall, specifically when there are children around.
That is so cute
Gorgeous! Thank you for this idea! My bathroom needs this.
Where did you get the wooden crates? Thanks in advance.
Really helpful information! Thanks for sharing.
Im gonna do it in Dark Grey.
How much was the legs at HD.
I love this idea. Thank you so much for sharing!
Beautiful 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
I bet it would look great too with a chicken wire door at the bottom to cover up some the toilet paper. This is great idea. Great job! Love it!
Looks like it could be very dangerous and unsteady especially in a child's room.  Looks nice but that's about it for me.  Not trying to be mean, just honest.
Came across this by accident and love the idea. Thx for sharing just brilliant.
I am definitely going to make this!!! Love the idea of toilet paper storage and toiletries
Where else can I purchase these crates?
just a great idea and beautiful  thank you this is one of the best ones  thank you for the great tutorial need to do this for my daughters rooms really simple and budget friendly .
Good   job   thank  you   so  much
Nice and the price is great. I want to try it
Love it, I'm going to make it but I am painting it black or dark grey.
Love this diy. 😍👌🏽 definitely sharing
I love ❤️ this going to make it for my bathroom thanks so much
Good morning, you did such a wonderful job. The product looks so expensive, I can’t even imagine how much that will cost in the store. I am going to try to make this for my bathroom. Thanks for sharing this amazing idea. I am in a subscriber to your channel and look forward to catching up on rest your videos. I would love for you to take a look at my channel and let me know what you think if you like what you see please consider subscribing. Have an amazing day
Thank you, loved this DIY! I believe I can even do it! I've always wondered about adding legs if you can't afford a drill set! I also didn't know you could take the screws out of the legs like that! Turned out so pretty and your decor was beautifully placed in there! I'm wondering how it's lasted this last year?! Many thanks!
love love your work, will copy and do.  I love that you made suggestion on saving on cost
I've got a project I need those crates for but those crates were pricey.
Wow, this is such a beautiful project.  Thank you for sharing 😊
How much were the wooden crates and where'd did you get them?
I just found your channel here and this is the first video of yours that I have seen! Great video and I am going to make this. I subscribed to your channel and look forward to watching a lot more of your videos. You are an inspiration! Thank you for sharing your creativity!
I made a desk out of crates and I LOVE it
I absolutely love that!!! I have always loved those wooden crates and would love decorating with them I'm really into The Farmhouse look but I love that clean white shelving unit made with crates it's wonderful I can't say enough about!!!!
Where do you buy the crates from and how much are they
What a great idea! I have been apprehensive about going to home Depot for those wooden legs and I'm glad you described a little of your experience in using them.Thank you. I am a subscriber now.
Great idea love the “no drill idea” thxs
Would like to know the measurements ?  H (including the legs) x W x  D
Why is it that employees at Home Depot never know anything (they need more training)., glad u were smarter than those employees in regards to the wooden legs..
How much did that cost ?
That is beautiful I will be trying that for my bathroom
Very pretty and useful. TFS
I am going to try this. looks so nice
I did this cabinet in black and I love it. Thanks for the idea.  Update I also did it in a Stan dark brown love it also. I did a wall shelf for my master bath too!! Just love these crates.
Very cute project. You explained it very well.
What a GREAT IDEA!!!! Love this!!! Sooooo EASY with a lovely addition to any room  in your home!!! THANK YOU  MAY GOD BLESS YOU TOO SWEET LADY!! 🥰👍🏻🙏🏻
love love love this sooooo much for my small space!!
It is definitely not elegant, but it is pretty. It looks like it could be used in a few different rooms. I would have painted before attaching everything, and then done touch ups if needed.
Very nice
This is just a great idea n beautiful too !
I love this
Thank you for this video - I have been looking for a storage solution for a while that is STURDY! This is Perfect!!!!!
)
That's  really nice! Great Idea I am going to do that!
This DIY is great 👍 I love it 🥰 it’s just what I need. You’re so right it will be good for so many uses. Thank you so much for sharing this project. I look forward to seeing more.
You ladies did a very nice job on this shelf unit. Thanks for sharing 💜
I Loved this video, Thanks so much for posting it. That’s an awesome DIY! Great Thinking. May God keep Blessing You & Everybody that reads this.
Loved it you inspired me I also made a vanity using your idea
where did you purchase the crates. Linda
I love this unit!!! I've been shopping all over for this size shelving unit to update and storage in my second bathroom so I appreciate your Creativity  very much ! Thank you for sharing !!!
How did you make holes in the wood to put the legs on
I am going to put this in my living room
Love, love, love this! This is exactly what I need for my small bathroom, toilet and shower area. ❤
Very pretty!!!
Oh my gosh this is beautiful.  Great job.
so beautiful and elegant 😍 where is all the bath stuff from?
I love it!
Yes... I'm so looking forward to making this And Seeing More Of Your Videos....
I'm gonna make one of these and install lights at the top
👍
Do you know how tall it is without the legs?
thank you for the tip about the sales! I was wanting to make some sort of storage unit with crates but had no idea where to find them for less than $10 for a decent size
I love it ! I wouldn't put it in a child's room because, it could be too tipsy and it could fall on the child. You brass it on the wall I guess.
I am going to try and use your idea to make a corner hutch for my dining area. I love yours it is so sweet.
This is a fantastic idea!
Did the legs come with a plastic piece you glued to the corners?.  Did you drill a hole in the crate corners and screw the legs into the crates? ??
que lindo le quedò mil gracias x la idea😁
Amazing thanks for sharing! you are so talented!
Will this be sturdy enough for a book shelf?
Wow..gorgeous!
This is beautiful, Michael's sells wooden crates like these, now I have to look out for their sales! 😄💜
This is really cute and is gonna look nice in my new bathroom thank u soo much for sharing ur idea it was very helpful good job
Awesome!! I am going to do this for my daughter’s bathroom.   Where did you buy the legs? Home depot?
This is beautiful, thank you so much for sharing with us.
i love it looks so good,can i know where did u get the wood boxes
Hi ! were did u find the crates? sorry didn't get that part I love it by the way!
Love
Hermoso
This is really nice.  I would love to use it as a kids nightstand or a cute/inexpensive coffee table/end table.  (with two crates) and legs.
👍
So pretty.
Precioso!!!!! 😊😊👏🌹🐶
This is exactly what I need for my small space. You did an amazing job. Here’s hoping 🤞 I can do half the job you did!  😀. Thank you for sharing. 🌸💫
Wowww...gorgeous 😍👏👏👏
👍👍👍👍
Nice
Justo lo que necesitaba para mí baño
Ke bonito y ke buena idea me encantó  Saludos desde Monterrey, México 😍
Where do you get the wooden crates
👍👍👍👍very nice ı lake ıt
It's beautiful! Great job! Thanks so much for sharing!
What a beautiful piece 😁 The end result was just stunning ❤️❤️❤️
Nasıl begennemisler hayret..cok guzelll
very nice!! I love it
GIRL!!!! YOU GOT SKILLS!!!!! Thank you for making this video, I SO enjoyed watching it, you did an AMAZING JOB!!!! Woohoo!!!!
This is amazing!!!
Absolutely lovely
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
This is cute!! You could also stack two high for cute night stands; if you have a high bed. I like my bed lifted
Stunning!  😀💫
👍
Brilliant!!!
Can you tell me the what size books would fit in the crates? The inside, top to bottom, measurement?  Looks beautiful!  Love this!  Esp. The legs!  Very elegant!
It came out very nice 👍🏽😂
I love it
Lindo trabalho👏👏👏😘
Wow beautiful! So glad I found this! Thanks for sharing. Will be making this for my bathroom asap :)
Ware do you get the crates
You could even just stack 2 of these an make a side table for next to your bed
I love this idea! Thank you so much, this is the best shelf I have seen yet!
This is very nice
I was also thinking laying horizontal and put baskets in the containers... way cool!!!!  Thanks so much for posting!!!
I love your creation, I'm gonna make myself a couple of these crates!! I can use mor storage space!!
very nice diy
I enjoyed watching your video ;) I have been watching different things to do with craft.lol I can be pretty handy when I want to be.i would love to try this it looks amazing great job😊👍have a good evening thank you for sharing
very pretty.
So pretty. It doesn't look cheap. U did an awesome job!! Blessings to you.
Oh my goodness! It is so beautiful. I  will be doing this as an surprise for my daughter. She just got her 1st apartment. Yaaaay lol!
This will be perfect for my closets.  So excited about this.  Such a great idea, thank you much!
I saw this and knew it is what I was looking for to use in my bathroom. Need to decide on the color though.   I got my crates @ Joann's. They were on sale for 30% off plus I had an additional 20% off total order. 50% off works for me.   I got the lg. bottle of Gorilla Wood glue in the home maintenance section of Walmart... $4.87. They only had the small 4oz bottle in the craft section.   Today it is far too humid to glue & paint... Project will have wait a couple days, and I still need the legs!
It turned out beautiful!  It would go anywhere!  I need storage in my kitchen and it would work fantastic. Thank you for a wonderful idea.  I like the white too!
Beautiful!
Great idea, good job!
Wow, I LOVE that !
Very nice!! Did u attach something on the side of the crates to keep them together?? Is it black attachments on the side?
Looks so good!!!
What I like is you can make it what ever size you need.  It would be  cute bookshelf with just two crates and maybe shorter legs for a kids room.  I could see it as a side table too.  I love it. I wrote this before you said it.  😂 Maybe I still have a little craftiness left in my brain somewhere.
This is so cute.  I am so amazed at what you crafty people can do with cheaper stuff.  This is adorable.  I love too that all you women use glue for stuff rather than needing the best tools in the workout would even be pretty with just some lacquer or varnish too. It's so sweet.  I do not know, though, how all you girls work with your long finger nails.  😂 All of you have such pretty nails.
What do you call the stuff that is holding the crates together, and where can I purchas it
This is so great I love it. thanks for sharing.
Beautiful!
Great idea!!  Thanks!
beautiful!
I just discovered this video and I love this cabinet!
I love this! It looks amazing :-) I've been trying to find something that would work for organizing my purses (The few things I splurge on) that kept them all in once place but where I could display them a bit and this would be perfect. Right now I have them piled on a top shelf in my closet but this looks narrow enough that it might actually fit in a spot in my small walk in closet. I can think of so many uses for this I might make a few. Thank you so much!
Yes very nice !!  However may I suggest that this unit is too tall for its size ! To my mind if used for kids storage etc, it is likely to be  seen by them as a great ' ladder ' !!  It should be a fixed to the wall , however it is used !!!  Health and safety at all times please !!!
I LOVE it!!! Did you say what the price of the crates was?? Thank you for this video!!!
Beautiful!  I'll be making SOME of these for my seeing room and my grandkid's room!!
New subscriber great vlog I must try. Thank you for sharing.✌
Great job
فكرة حلوة
Stunning!!
That is so neat! I really like that👍
Oh my gosh ladies!!! Where have you been all my life.  Such a great diy -- you saved me big bucks!
You did a wonderful job! Thank you for sharing and I can't wait to start this project. Blessings. 💟❤
Beautiful!
Thank you!!! I've been looking for a narrow bookcase but I never thought of doing it myself with crates! You have inspired me to try something like this.
I love it!!! Thank you!!!
Adorable wow.
It did turn out beautiful! It looks great!! Amazing job!!
How much you charge to make this?
Pretty!! Beautiful job
I really like this you did a good job
Love this!!!!
So you predrilled the holes for the legs?
Cant wait to try this but add mirrors to it and spray paint it silver. Could go for a small curio like storage
I live in Canada and am having a hard time finding the legs.  Where did you get purchase them from?   Thanks
How to organiz your garage
😍♥️
When there's a will there's a way and leave it to a woman to figure it out...loveLoveLOVE this project! 💖
How about some rails or hooks on the sides.  GREAT JOB
LOVE THIS!!! I SO NEED SOME OF THESE!!!
The cost is about $75-$80 if you buy crates at Wal-Mart,  very pretty, and functional
Beautiful 😍 very clever👍🏼🤗 can’t wait  to try this!
Where did you find the legs? I'm going to make this and i know i can get the crates at Wal-Mart but not sure where the legs can be found. Also how much did the project cost you? Thank you
Anyone have an idea how I could secure this to a wall?. I want to do this  for my daughters room to keep her toys and books.  She is a toddler and I dont want her climbing on it.
Cleaver woman using these legs... this is my next project!
Wonderful work.
should had painted first. but cute
I use those all the time and remove the screws. Some E6000 and hot glue is perfect. I’ve also picked up the brackets to screw them into for heavier projects.
Gorgeous! I’m going to make this for my daughter to use in her college apartment. Thank you so much!
TFS...I LOVE this!!!!!
What kind of glue please
Gorgeous! Thank you for sharing.  I need a storage unit for books, etc.
I need to purchase these wooden crates so I can make this for my Godmother who is looking for a 17 inch wide cabinet/shelving? This was awesome! Thank you so much!!
What a beautiful project.  I am definitely going to the craft store and buy these crates asap!  Thank you for sharing your awesome talent with us....May God continue to bless you!!!
Beautiful
Your work is excellent!  Well done!  I love it!!!
Amazing
Fabulous, good idea your so creative love your ideas 💕thank you.
I really like this storage unit and how you showed us how to make it, you did great! Thanks for this instructional video😁
absolutely beautiful on my way to the store I needed something like this for 3 of my bathrooms
Very nice, but how about speeding up the video by not showing every single step? For the four legs, show how you put on the first one, and then show the four legs done without showing each one separately being screwed in. Same with the glue application.  However, you did a really great job start to finish.
😍😍😍
Thank you so much for making this video ~ My family and I are going to be starting over with nothing and I will be able to make them this project for their rooms little at a time and also make it for the kitchen and bathroom ... Thank You :)
Wow! I think I could even do this, thanks so much. New subscriber for sure.
Wow! Beautiful job. I think I will make one for my craft room. Thanks for sharing 😊
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS ! I am going to make this by my door for shoes but leave the wood as is or stain it ! But you did a BEAUTIFUL job Thanks for the idea!
Thank you for the great tutorial!  Just what I need for my small bathroom storage.
I love this and it gave me an idea! I need storage in my bathroom but it needs to sit on the counter. I also subscribed to your channel!
Beautiful! TFS! Stay blessed! 😍😍😍
Beautiful outcome and wonderful idea! New subscriber with this video. Thanks for a great project idea.
What a cool idea!  TFS. I may have to try this for my art room. 👍❤️
You did a beautiful job!
Looks great! 😃
Thank you! I want to expand this sideways and  use it for crafts. thanks so much.
Very nice👍👍👍
would it be better to not screw the legs in and just glue it onto the base?
I love this cant wait to do this
How creative! I've never thought about doing that before. But now I will. Thank you so much for sharing.
From where I am, these crates are 10.54 a piece!

Exactly what i was looking to make!!! TFS!!
Omgosh this is too cute... I'm trying this for my bathroom 😍
Love it !  Some many rooms to use it in ......I'm thinking two crates high with feet would make great night stands 😊
Could you do 3 crate by 4 crate with legs for like a pantry for a small apartment
I need extra storage in my kitchen. This is great. I can’t wait to do this project. Going to do in beach theme. That’s what my house is done in. Thank you for sharing.

That's a really great idea and wonderful looking too!
That is so beautiful. Just gave me an idea in doing a wall closet with shelving! We're currently remodeling.
I like it👍
I love crate and recycled wood products as I made our dining table and wish I Videos it, it’s made from different grains and coloured wood and sanded then finishing lacquer on it and it looks Country beachy Which with the left over wood I made a tv unit and a coffee tab,e for our lounge room. I painted my youngest 9yrs old sons room in a galaxy theme - I Blended Light blue and midnight blue together then put a white glowing galaxy swirl around the light and painted some coloured Moons, planets, shooting stars, Meteors, all adding a lil red, orange, purple and stuck down 5000+ stars that still work great then in my eldest 14yr old sons room I painted rainbow offset Geometrical triangles and where the tape was I painted the white I’m glowing paint and his room decor matched.  In our room I got a long stretched canvas with a frame and painted a Heart with a locket and 4 keys actual Antique keys stuck on and placed beds down over and beside the heart to act as a chandelier and it’s the perfect size above the bed head of our dark stained king bed. I’m crafter to just like you 😊 iv got a YouTube channel so once I start making things for my business in the shed over then next following 2wks I’ll be sure to film it on air for you all to see. There’s only Unboxing videos on there now as we moved and I sold all last years stock before moving.  See you next time 🌟
Thank you for the idea, new subscriber from Melbourne, Victoria Australia 🇦🇺 top job 🌺
Australia needs a home depo and dollar tree. Iv just had a 3 car garage built and I lot is mine for my business and a sit down and display area for customers to either watch or test my testers before they buy. I’m wanting storage shelves to put my containers, Oils and colours on and also my butters and waxes and a work area. Iv decided a nice see through light curtain will seperate me from the display area but can be pulled back if customers want to see. As I only do Melt and Pour soaps in every shape and size you can think of and I use Ecosoya Q210 for my candles and Melts as well as other skin care products as it’s the only soy wax comparable to use in skincare. My colour accents will be Fuchsia Pink, Dark Purple, White, Turquoise/Aquamarine Blue.
WOW NICE!! THANKS FOR SHARING!!
That is beautiful!
Love, love, love....this piece turned out gorgeous. It's a sturdy, inexpensive, easy  project that looks like it came from a high end furniture store. The ugly, fake wood furniture cost at least triple the investment and would not last. Very impressed. Thanks and have a blessed day!
I love it it's beautiful I decided to try it because I need storage desperately and I ended up making one similar to yours only staining it and I went 6 crates High thank you for your video!
oh wow all these ideas I love it
Very nice. Thanks for sharing!
MARAVILHOSO O SEU PROJET.
I'm a new subscriber and what a beautiful piece of furniture, the legs that you chose give it a very elegant look!! The mirror tray(not sure if that's the correct name) that holds the perfume bottles is gorgeous!! I can't wait to try and make one of these pieces myself! Great idea, thank you so much for sharing!! 💖
Love this!  Thank you for sharing!  I do believe I am going to make this :)
Wow
very nice!
Beautiful
👍subbed
Love this - I have some of these crates.  I'm anxious to get started.  Thanks for the great idea!
I love this !!
Good job
Love this!!!
I love it!
love, love love this! Couldn't you staple gun it in a few areas? Not big staples. Just to make sure it doesn't come apart? It turned out wonderful!
To mvch blabla.
You did that! 💖💖💖
Very nice! And it seems pretty economical. Thank you for a awesome tutorial 😊
VERY, VERY NICE
Very very nice.   Good job.
Great. Job, came out beautiful !!!
LOVE this.
So beautiful , functional and versatile!!!!💟💟💟💟💟
Beautiful !!!
very nice
I just found your channel and love this idea, it’s going to be very helpful because I live in a small trailer with under 500 ft living space. So every inch counts and I think this project will be awesome, thanks for sharing. 👍🏻👍🏻💜💜💜🦋🎼🐊
Omg.    Love this I must do one for my bathroom ohhh girl it came out beautiful
It turned out gorgeous! Definitely going to try this.
Those screws are out in bc they assume you will attach to wood...you would need a nilut and floaters well...
This is adorable! I literally have 4 of those creates that I used for storage in a former apartment and now they don't really have a place or purpose, but this is a simple project that I think will look great in my bathroom actually!
Great video. I love how perfect your nails are and you're building stuff!
I love the project and am inspired to make one also! I love the music in this video what is playing? I would love to buy the song!
Very very cool. I'm going to check out more y'alls videos. Good work yall
Awesome work!
Love this!  I need something for books in my office and sewing room and this is perfect.  Thanks for sharing.  Nice job.
How much were the legs?
Concrit: it could do with some crown moulding along the top to finish it. It’s small enough, you could probably find some scrap moulding.
You ladies did an excellent job on this project! Great explanation. I feel like I can make this for sure! 💖
😍😍😍
I'm totally don't this, this weekend!!!
This is beautiful
Beautiful and functional. Live happy, live long. God bless
Great job i will do it thanks for sharing
Super cute! Love how it turned out.
Very nice I'm going to make one and put it in my sewing room
Nice
You said "spray it" with what?  Primer? Then spray paint it?  You just srewed the legs on? That's it? I'm confused.
Too cute♥️
Amazing Job !
This is beautiful, functional, easy enough for me  to try.  Thank you for sharing this.   I can't wait to build one like it!
Love it! Great idea
I love this idea!!!! So creative and nice looking!!! Seems easy to do as well!!!
This came out so pretty and practical
Im sry, I left a comment without my name... tray...
Nice. 👍
This is so great.  Definitely going to try this.  Going to try to find smaller boxes hopefully for a smaller section in my bathroom
Is there henges on the outside of the crates connecting them?
It came out amazing!~
Where did you get the crates?
This came out very pretty!
Nice
I loved that idea
I'm glad this showed up in my recommendations! New subscriber.
Love it will be doing it as well
Thank you I love this.  I need this for my small bathroom.  Awesome 💟💟💟
Love it
How did you put the holes in the crate for the legs?
Job well done.  I so have to make one for my bathroom.  ~Smile!
LOVE the background music
LOVE LOVE LOVE........GOING TO MAKE ONE FOR MY TOWELS IN THE BATHROOM!!!!!!
Love it
Very cool
Save some money & use plain wood bar cut to size for back 2 legs (not very visible when item placed.)
Another genius customer solution to HD staff's  "Impossible, it can't be done!"
How about adding a mirror door on the creat shelves.
I Love this idea, tfs :)

Nice
BEAUTIFULLL!!!!!!thank you for sharing lots of Blessings for you..
I love this unit...so cute!!! I have a tiny bathroom, with no storage and this is just perfect!
Very beautifull , I will try it 😊
👍🏽👍🏽
This is awesome!! I’m totally gonna make this! Thanks for sharing!😄
Love this !! Thank you for sharing 💕
Where did the crates come from ?
Beautifully done!!! Great idea!!! Two Thumbs Up! 👍👍
can you wash it? is the paint waterproof? what did you use for the paint? ty
awesome job i love it
Very cute
Outstanding!
I love this!
Found you on my recommended Que.Oh, my gosh I love your channel you are amazing. Liked and subbed
Beautiful  finish.!
How many crates did you use
Super Cute!!!! Thanks for sharing!
What a beautiful creation, made out of crates! I love it!! Now, I know what project I will be doing next! Thanks for sharing! 👍💖👍
This would be perfect for my bathroom and by the living room door !
Thanks for sharing your wonderful ideas.
i've been looking for something like this, it's very pretty!
Fantastic diy!  It may tip over if heavier items are placed on the top shelves, especially on carpet.  Ikea has free wall anchors to avoid furniture tipping.
Sou nova por aqui, mas adorando tudo, parabéns, amei...
Donde se consiguen esas cajas
Zoos job xoxo
Love this!!! New sub, and looking forward to discovering more on your channel. Hope you can stop by my channel as well. Thanks for sharing.
I love it what country feel just loving the project
This project is beautiful. Where can I buy crates.
I need this for my craft room, want to make a couple❤️❤️❤️❤️love the white color
was it the medium crates or large crates from joanns?
Fun!
Beautiful!
Sorry for the confusion,😱 but my answer was for compassion, I had to backtrack through the comments.
Compassion, I personally wouldn't put it by the toilet because of any damage to it from water or urine. Good luck with whatever u decide😊
I thought your question was, why not? In ref: to not putting that nice shelf u ladies made. I hope this isn't getting confusing. Once again great job👍
Really cute!!
To answer your question, why not? It's very nice and I wouldn't want it to get damaged by water or urine on a bad aim lol😊 Good job ladies
you did a fantastic job, the storage unit is beautiful
Really nice and I gave it a thumbs up but I would be careful putting it in a child’s room. A toddler can easily tip it onto themselves.
Omg i love thissss
Wow!!!! What an awesome idea!!! Love it❤️
Love it!!!   Light enough to move it around too......
So cute! Great idea 😉 this inspired me for my rolling kitchen island I plan to make soon!
Omg! This is an excellent idea, I've been on the hunt for nice farmhouse looking storage for my bathroom and this is what will do perfectly ! Thanks for sharing.😃
That is just gorgeous!  I love it. I may have to try that.
Excelent thanks 🙋🏻‍♀️
You kind of sound like Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama. Has anyone ever said that too you?
great idea thank you
Love it!!! I need this in my bathroom and am going to make it!!!
Very pretty!
Beautiful I love it first time watching I will keep watching
Love that I want to make one.
beautiful!
What a beautiful little shelf unit... that's awesome... thanks for sharing all the info on how you created it and where to get the items...
Awsome idea!♡♡♡ will be making this mabe a few lol
You, have vishion and i love your idea on the most elegant piece of furniture, and easy enought for me to do.Thank you
So pretty!  Going to try to make one soon!!
I love Pinterest. Well done! Tfs!!!
Big thumbs up! Going to make some of these for use at craft fair events and shows.  Love it
Well done ladies it's looks fabulous. Now I know what I'm doing for storage in my bathroom. Thank you 😘
Sooo beautiful and cleverly crafted and affordable to make. If you bought something liker that at a home goods or kirklands. It would have costed  over $100. I'm sooo gonna make one for my bathroom. Possibly one for every room lol.
😍
That's a Great DIY love it . I need to make me 2 for both of my restroom  Thanks for Sharing .
I have been looking to buy something like this forever! Now I can just make it! Thank you!!! 💖
Wow this is Gorgeous!!  How many  cans of paint you use?  I really want to do this.  This will be my spring project.  Ty for sharing.  Have a beautiful bless day.
That is a wonderful shelf unit!  You both did a great job.
Nice project! I would rather use the drill for the legs, just to keep the legs from popping off down the road if I wanted to move the unit, but I have a garage of power tools I can access :) Wood glue isn't designed as a permanent glue, it's more for holding pieces in place  while the screws or nails are being put in, and kind of an "extra hold" but not the main strength.
Wow so stunning 😍 and the decor you chose perfect 👌🏻
Beautiful job
Were the legs expensive.  Love the style
Subscribed!!  Love this!!
Very clever!!  Love this!!
I'm in love
I love this so much! I would love to do this and stain it a dark brown. do you know if metal pipes would work for the legs? or are there metal legs that can be bought? my style is industrial so I'd love to use metal with the wood. thank you so much for this videom
I love the crate shelves. They are beautiful.
Very clever! Love it!
Wow...so simple and what Ive been looking for for a long time for my bathroom. Way better then the prices of cabinets these days.
Beautiful job!
Beautiful work 🤩👏🏼🤩
very nice shelf.hi you have a new subscriber
This is a brilliant idea!!!! I want to make 2 of these for my home. I just subscribed to your channel. I can't wait to see more of these ideas from you. Tfs.
FYI, storage means keep it clean for later. What you did is a dust magnet.
It's beautiful and exactly what I need for my bathroom! I'm excited about making one! Thank you.
Very nice! I may try it myself!
I luv this idea this is my next project for sure
I love this idea for a plant shelf on my deck. Ikea sells several kinds of four-inch table legs that are inches for a shorter/cheaper leg option. http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00320742/
I really love this! It could be used in any room in the house which is very nice. Thank you for sharing this with us! Take care and blessings to you and your family.💖
I love it 😍 thanks for sharing God bless!!

Did you by any chance price wooden shelving like that compared to what you spent to make it? And what kind of spray paint did you use?
Did you drill the legs holes before screwing them in

Awesome Lady!!!
A very beautiful idea. I absolutely love it and I'll be making this for my bathroom. Thanks for sharing!💜
I've been wanting to make something out of those crates this is perfect

Nice I love it
Beautiful!  It has the cottage look that I love.  Great job!!   Thanks for sharing!!!
Q hermoso
Side note: The total cost of this project was $45.00... we purchased the crates from Joann's while they were on sale so we couldn't use our 60%off coupon code while the sale was going on and we really wanted to make this project so we paid $8.00 a crate instead of $5.60 a crate but it was well worth it... It's convenient, it fits in small corners, it doesn't take up a lot of space, and it's durable.
Wonderful idea!  ❤️💜😊🇨🇦
Great Job Ladies!!! 😍😍😍I don’t know why anyone would give you a thumbs down? ☹️ I going to make this for my daughter.
what was the total cost of the project
I love this idea. It looks really nice.
