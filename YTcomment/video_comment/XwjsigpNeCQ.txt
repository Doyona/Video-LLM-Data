HI FLO ,ME GUSTA LA FORMA QUE EXPLIQUES ,( AND LOVING THE WAY OF YOUR COOKING AS USUAL ) CON MUCHO CARIÑO Y GRANDE ABRAZO .SO YUMMYYYY FROM SPAIN ALSO
Thank you very much Auntie 🤗 Just made this and can’t wait to tuck into it tomorrow for lunch 😁 I did adjust it as I did not put any meat. I also think I over fried the tomato but it still tastes great 😁
Wow!
~Excellent~ presentation!
My mom passed away last September and she used to say the tomato should like wet sand or granulated which is when most of the moisture and the rawness is fried out. 🙂
I love it
Too much oil
Just stumbled on this channel..Absolutely love how detailed and patient you are when explaining the steps. Kudos!
Flo Can tomato puree replace fresh tomato's i just heard of fresh tin tomatoes don't know if they are same with fresh tomatoes thanks

All this wahala just to chop rice ???  abeg, make i go buy rice for bustop! i no get time

Too much oil is not healthy for the heart
Madam thank you for your cooking recipe and procedure is really the best so far for me. Vietnam
Is there a way to make Nigerian tomato coconut stew ?
Is there a differennce between using tomato puree and tomato sauce??
Is there a reason why stew would still be tasting tangy even though the stew has been fried well? What causes the sour taste? I used only Roma tomatoes and scotch bonnet peppers as the base for the tomato paste as I do not have access to tobasco/tatashe/romano pepper
Sorry, do we use habaneros in nigeria?
I’m dating an Igbo man and I’m wanting to cook some traditional food for him. I’m Jamaican and I have a lot of experience in the kitchen. I’m happy to have found your channel
Can we store this stew in freezer before adding in the meat etc?
Love your cooking and teaching, I am a better cook because of it. Can I use tomato sauce (not puree) and paste? will that impact the end result?
I've been making tomato stew all my life but I learnt  the rationale  why some things should/shouldn't be done while  cooking. Thanks a lot for sharing!
Why do you put the scotch bonnet pepper last please ?
😂😂storing like your life depends on it👌🏽
Madam you're the best. Very easy, simple and not complicated Thanks
Thank you !!! I don’t have a blender at my university apartment ❤️
Wow this is so nice, now let me prepare tin tomato stew, I don't know how to get that bay leaves in Dubai, what's the work in stew
Tnx ma I will try dis method
Soon i will return to the kitchen
Sis Flo , I really love watching your cooking.. .... Kudos
if i marinate the chicken over night, could i just bake (or airfry) the meat ?
Excellent instructions! I will try this.
Thank you. I gained some useful tips there.
correct cook
How long should you cookfry the tomato pury?
About how long do I need to fry the puree for?
Awesome you are the only cook I see (African) who pour off the oil.👏👏👏👏👏🖒🖒🖒.( I am not an African love to watch the different cook though.) Love to try different recipes. ✌✌✌❤❤❤
Eastend brand tomatoes are subtle
Nice one
The meat pie man wrote ‘please take one only’...knowing full well that people will be taking ones to eat the next day!

Just like I grew up watching... I can't wait to cook better Nigerian stews!
Stay away from Napolina tinned tomatos. They line their cans with BPA 💀
You are awesome. Great cook
🥘🍛😋
Thanks for sharing I do have another new idea of making stu
Love the food..your accent, so hungry right now🤗😋
I am overwhelmed by this video. This is what I want to prepare this weekend because Fresh tomatoes are now costly in Germany. Thanks for sharing my beloved sister, Flo.
U are looking more beautiful today ma
I’m even tired of all this your too much explanation like you’re doing a PHD —— 😆
That looks like blood so this is disgusting
You were made for this Flo ... you have a unique way of capturing the attention of your viewers and you do this effortlessly. Thank you.
Aunty Flo looks like your beef in Spain is tough oh...if I boil their Australian beef with pressure cooker it will turn to pulp...this has really put me off beef and even shaki here.lol
GREAT video! Seriously, fantastic! I understood this, didn't feel overwhelmed, and will cook it tonight! I'm wondering, after you added the water to the tomato paste it seemed to develop the consistency of out-of-the-jar pasta sauce.... so could pasta sauce be used as an alternative to tomato paste instead of blending tatashe?
what's the difference between a tin tomato paste and a tin tomato puree?
Am I the only one that didn't see the time you added the spices
Thanks this helped me
I just want to say i literally followed her instructions and made this and it literally came out perfect, my mum makes it looks easy but sooooo longgg
This looks amazing you are a beautiful person! Please share more recipes
Thank you for the perfect explanation and rational for everything you do😍😍
Why not use fresh tomatoes for the tomato puree
Great, will definitely try this (again) in the future. Having watched quite a bit of your videos, I´ve come to the conclusion that the single most important piece of equipment one would need in order to cook African food in a timely fashion is: The pressure cooker. In 20 minutes time, you can cook that amount of assorted meats for 3-4 persons that it´d take at least an hour to do without one. So I will definitely have to get me a pressure cooker in the near future, because when I get that, I´ll be able to eat African food (which is my favorite kind of food) a lot more often than what I currently do.  I´m going back home to Namibia for christmas though, we are going to eat a lot of chicken & goat cooked the traditional way (in a large pot over fire) , it´s hard to put my excitement in words, ahahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂 u funny die seee i dunno ehh last week i made stew i used 40 tomatoes omoh after I blended it see how big it was i was so happy. Then i fried it it became small, kili kili is it Because i over fried it?
Wonderful. I recently purchased that tomato brand as well. Please, what part of Spain do you reside?
many thanks...
Anty flow diz video was very educative for me as alway thank you so much.keep it up
I thought it is better to fry the tin tomatos first before the raw blended tomatoes
Tnx sweety, nice one dear
The excess oil is nice for egusi soup, nice one flo
Nice one there Ma Flo, what if the tomato puree and paste were added at the same time? Will it give the same result?
Yummy, flo nwanyioma you make me wanna eat tin tomato stew, well done onyeoma
"Do not a popping stew make" 🤣🤣.. I love it! Thank you for your amazing videos!
Thank you! I can surprise my hubby with a proper Nigerian stew now 😊 Lots of love ❤❤❤❤
lovely sis
Hiya aunti Flo is tomato puree the same as passatta? TIA
Thank you for the video. Why didn’t you use any bell peppers or did I miss that?
wow thanks for the video,i usually fry the tomato paste before adding the purée,is it a wrong method?
The detailed and sometimes scientific explanations of your food tutorials is what keeps me here -  I always, always learn something new. Thank you
Nice one 👌 Can I use red bell peppers to replace d sweet peppers
You are good Dear, you inspire me alot 👍👍😘😘
Mercadooona Mercadona. The best among the rest.  Love their triturado so much. Muchas gracias  Flo. Te quiero monton ❤❤❤❤❤
A haa! , love all your vidoes. Thank you ,thank  you  .
Now I know the difference between purée and paste
Please madam Flo where do you buy your palm oil from cause have check some African shop around me here.
Another way to get the popping red...try paprika powder. For easy use.
You are simply the best teacher. I always find it difficult preparing stew. Thanks for this Ma'am
Na wa oooo the way this woman explains things eee.... Hmmm! even if your are iti bolibo you must understand what she is saying by fire by force!!!
I haven't seen derica tomato puree in ages.The stew looks very inviting,aunt Flooo,i am salivating pop.Biko,send some.....😍😘😍
At 1:25 where do you get that type of tomato puree from? Can you buy it online or do you know a different brand of tomato puree that we can use?
Thanks for sharing, give it up for the best cook 👏👏👏👌🙌
What a great time saver! What I enjoy most in your videos is the appropriate use of cooking registers in  your explanations. Just when you are thinking you have arrived with a particular recipe,another one comes fully loaded.Thanks again
Yeahh thumbs up chibuike
Well done,  Beautiful sister FLO,  the stew look so good.  Enjoy it.
looks yumny🥗🥂🍾🍹.               Flo what happened to the fine braids frim Nigeria, please tell me it is wig because that hair was too fine  be taken down so fast.
I love the way you explain the things we do but don't know why we do them You are a legend Flo! When they say cooking is science this is what they're talking about.
Well done
Super yum,I like red stew🙌👍
Aunty Flo why didn't  you save some of the stock? Curious...
Thank you ma. I live in Sweden and actually cook my stew like this but I wanted to see your method😊. One tip though: I grill the  fresh paprika or airfry them with onions before blending. That way you can put plenty in the blender once and blend because it will be soft and the flavour is enhanced
Aunty flo... well done ma Grammar/cooking class😄😄😄 I use this method for jollof rice stew Thanks for sharing.....
Nice👍
The stew looks so delicious
Wow. Thank you flow for the shout out. I enjoyed watching the video. We have similar styles of making tomatoes stew. The only thing I don't do is broiling/grilling the meat in the oven. I will definitely try it. I see it makes the meat more crunchy, tasty and appealing. Chijioke, Onyinye and my brother Emeka sends greetings to you and family. God bless you.
Flo, you are the real MVP!  I'm doing this method tonight.  Giving myself a break from blending my time away; dinner will be early tonight.  Question, did you add the bell peppers to the tomato puree?
Nice looking stew. I miss everything about Mecadona products. I was in Spain last two weeks. I almost cargo the whole of Mecadona 😀😀
can i bring my rice😘😘🍷🍷
That stew looks so appetising, I like grilled chicken or meat in my tomato stew. Chibuike's meat pie looks so delicious
Ah, aunty Flo I have to try this oh. I haven't made stew since cos I just dont have energy to be blending tomatoes. This is perfect for me! Thanks a bunch!
Onye nkem, that stew is popping!! That tin tomato stew can be such a huge time saver, no boiling or blending tomatoes involved.
I also filter my meat stock to give it nice look
Just when I think I've mastered the art of Nigerian stew, I realized I have not mastered the science. Ms. Flo, what if I fry the tomatoe puree and paste the same time?   Thank you for sharing!
Daalu nwanne nwanyi✋
I used tin tomatoes before to give it reddish colour but now I don't use tin again but only fresh tomatoes and fry it very well till  when  it stop jumping up and down with that I the tomatoes is well fried . Even the stew are eating now my husband thought I use added tin tomatoes pest but no ...One secret about stew is don't allow it burnt with the outcome make attractive
