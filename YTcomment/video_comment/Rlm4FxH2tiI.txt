Nice :-)
what you have used as electrodes can you explain please?
Cool make a bigger version of it
Did you use two different types of metal for the positive and negative output? Or is there just a coil all around it? Please explain a little more thoroughly than the video.
what soda washing soda or baking soda
now what is this you put on each side of the batry
Did you place any electrodes in it?
i want to know the current of that battery
what kind of soda did you use?
I think what he has is a roll of copper with an Iron nail that is on the other side that the copper fits around without touching the two so it will have to be made perfect where they won't touch inside the tube. If you look at all his videos you will see one that uses soda ash and lemon juice and a iron nail.
how that copper with blue thing on top of it is made
what is in the other side of battery? cooper wire or anything
what is that green colour thing which u put on both the sides
You just put it in your standard AA size battery recharger slot. (thats why I made it AA size.  Cheers!
how it can be recharged ?
