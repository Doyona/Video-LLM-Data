Thank you, and using vocal fry makes videos unwatchable for many people with misophonia. It is not something that can't be helped. It is an affectation, and it isolates many viewers.
Soft: 240°F, 116°C Firm: 250°F, 121°C Hard: 260°F, 127°C (infered. Not mentioned in vid)
Thank you SO MUCH for this - I tried your first vid and realized I was adding too much water when kneeding! Going to try again :)
okay so one things clear that i undercooked my sugar cause its a beautiful golden brown colour but its super sticky,melty and wont flick off, melts the moments i knead it. what should i do to make sure its firm so that i dont have to use strips?
lol I’m so confused, the first time I made it it went extremely well. Note that I’m trying to do it a second time my wax is basically clear even tho I got it up to a certain temperature 🥲
Cold paste it is.
What temperature should you cook it to for the kind to use in a wax warmer?
I am so confused… in another video you say to keep stirring so it doesn’t burn, but here you  leave it alone until it’s time to remove from the heat source. I guess I’ll just have to do whatever and hope it doesn’t waste a huge amount of sugar.
Scheiß Werbung,  bleibe mir ferner. Du nervst.  Unnötig.
I did 250F. Let it sit. And used next day. It was hard to take a scoop out of the jar. But i did and when i used on my skin after 1 or 2 times, it's just sticking so bad on my skin after. Like soft sticky. Idk what i did wrong. Anyone care to help?
I think I’m doing it wrong. I let it sit for a few days and it was hard as rock. So I warmed it up and it converted back to candy a few seconds after
Ty for this
Do you use squeezed lemons? 😫And does it matter if it’s the yellow ones or green. I wanna try to do this but with hearing it needs or you used a thermometer is me doubting to do it especially bc I don’t think I have one
Has anyone tried it with brown sugar? If so, is it supposed to take longer to get to the right texture?
oh my god thank you so much. after years of many failed attempts, i decided to try it out again and got it correct for the first time with the help of this video. so so many thanks because i couldn’t put together that i wasn’t cooking it for long enough previously! patience is key!
For pour and store, do you store it with the lid on or off so that it can get harder
How do you prevent the cold sugar from melting while trying to use it?
you are my super hero
can i use it on private area?
Thank you
I'd say it was actually informative
When do you start to stir?
how do you use it for your face, i can't even use it for my legs 😭😭😭😭
Thank you for this video! I saw your video and started sugaring my legs couple of months ago  Today I gave myself my first brazilian sugar wax, and the result is very good for the first time!
@abetweene   Might be a silly question but what are these containers? You mentioned that you microwave to warm the wax so they must be microwavable? Can you please link them?🤍
Which is the best to use with strips? I did the middle one and I hurt myself because it was too sticky and barely ripping the hair out.
My sugar gets hard if I kneed it and if I set it out for an hour you can’t even take it out because it’s hard like a rock. What am I doing wrong??help me
FYI, I have an appreciation for your cinematography
Please share the quantity of every item to be added in this
Thank you for your videos! You're a great teacher. Feels like a silly question, but can you pour the 240+F sugar mixture directly from the sauce pan into a plastic container for storage? Or should you let your sugar mixture cool a bit first? I'd be inclined to get the mixture off of/out of heat ASAP to stop the cooking process, but does the plastic survive contact with something so hot? Thanks for your insight!!
I had tried to make it many times but after it gets cool it became like a sugar dalgona candy... What to do
I've been using this for like 4 years now and then the last year I went and actually got it done while pregnant and not flexible l but now that I'm getting back Into it it hasn't been working and I'm so stumped the 2 cups sugar to 1/2 water 1/2 lemon juice aint working it's so watery I have to add more sugar . I'm actually stumped
In your other video you said the sugar changes colors as you wax w it because of dead skin cells. Yes dead skin cells are taken w the sugar but the kneading stage changes the color like that  regardless   It’s like when they pull candy and taffy. As they pull it the color changes.
Can u use vinegar if u don't have lemon at the moment. Also what material of  clothes are those you are using please
So dont stir it?
For anyone who uses celsius, the approximate conversion would look like this:  🇧🇷 Para quem usa celsius, a conversão aproximada ficaria assim:  soft / suave 235° - 240° F / 112, 8° - 115, 5° C  firm / firme  245° - 250° F / 118, 3° - 121, 1° C  hard / densa  250° - 265° F / 121, 1° - 129, 4° C
Why is mine watery ? 😢
Hi, Can we reheat it in a wax warmer that heats up to 70 C ? I heard sugar wax should be heated to about 50 so wondering if there'd be any issues/inconvenience caused if heated at 70
You’re amazing!!! I will be cleaning down there! it’s the only place I have hair!
thanks so much for specifying where to put the thermometer, that’s exactly what i came here for !!
Not me kneading mine and it still being rock hard 😌💀
240°
After hours of watching and returning to boil so many times, with wax never getting thicker…I’m gonna call it a night at 2am & revert to the pour & store. Super frustrating. Hours to learn how to make a hot tea mix 😢. Good night!
Thank you for this 😭😭 I’m trying to mimic the sugardoh wax (the owner took her recipe down after her brand got popular and she upped her prices). I don’t wanna pay $40 for a jar of melted sugar😑 this wax looks identical to her wax and I’m gonna start making my own and saving money thanks to you :))
I didn't have any thermometer and I couldn't see a thing. It turned out super brown, don't be like me...
can I use this on my coochie? Im trying to reduce landfill waste when it comes to caring for my cooter.
For some reason I can get my sugar mixture to 245°F very quickly but it's still clear and very syrup-y once it cools down...
Would it work just as good of I just bought caramels? I only want the sugar wax for my face...
Sister please tell me the recipe of Arabic halawa finger wax please..
Hi Ariane 👋. i wanted to ask about the ingredients; Can you swap out lemon juice for lime juice? i am severely allergic to lemon juice and want to know if it is possible and what changes would be expected in the result. Thanks for this video, very informative 😊
Hello! How long can the wax be kept? and how will you know that it can no longer be use?  I put it on the fridge after using it (i always make a large batch) then just microwave it. My wax usually last for 6 months before its totally gone.
why does it become hard when I do neading 😢?
Whenever I make sugar wax it is very good to use for the first time but after few days it gets a little soft from above layer I don't know why and how to help it
This is late as heck but with middle firmness sugar wax do I need strips?
So the first time I did it it was really stringy. The second time it was hard as a rock before it even cooler. Two questions: the stringy batch can it be recooked and used and second question: what can I do to use the hard as a rock batch? Also don't use a plastic spatula, mine melted in second batch. Can you pour it onto foil? Thanks for the informative videos!😊
My sugar keeps over bubbling how do I stop that? Lol I keep having to remove it from the stove
ERROR DESCRIPTION? - 1/2 cup each of water and lime juice = 1 cup  First video and audio in this one states 1/4 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup water = total of 1/2 cup  PLEASE ADVISE
Hi, Adriane! Did you order the plastic containers on Amazon? They have the perfect size!
So I need to make a huge batch to take on deployment since I wont have access to a stove.... can you provide a recipe for a HARD sugar wax, as I will be in a hot climate with no microwave. I like for 3 containers lol (like the soup container kind) Thanks in advance.
The wax i made is medium high temperature colour and i put them in freezer but it's not kneeding and when I put them on my hairs it's like liquid... 😩 Is it undercooked??
I finally sugared myself and stopped chickening out, I only finished because I spent $30 on sugardoh lmao but now Im gonna make this no knead one to continue my sugaring journey 🥳 thank you for all of the informative videos!!!
Question do you need lemon juice because  I can't find any
Question for how long can the sugar last in the container? and should it notbe stored in the fridge?
Video says 1/4c water n lemon; notes say 1/2c!
thank you for the temperature trick, I love when the things I do have something precise to base on. However, despite going for a hard ball and even beyond (cooked until 269F), my paste came out more like a soft ball and in my climate right now (29 at home) it was impossible to use it without strips (even so it still worked great). It was very flexible, golden in color and melted on my skin. I wonder if this is due to the sugar quality or is there something else in play.
Thank you for this video! So helpful and girrrrrrl you’re saving me lots of $$$$ 😘  Thanks again for the great content—you’re very thorough and your videos are so organized and visually appealing! 👍🏼😎
Can i use a smaller batch like 1/2 cup sugad and 1/4th cup lemon and water?
Ok, I think I found my answer, I added too much water when kneading... Thank you!
Mine become hard
I just tried my first batch and I think I under cooked it maybe, it’s not the right color so back to step one! Lol
Im curious if a soft kneeded wax and a hard/firm kneeded that are both like the same softness and texture in the same temperature perform differently because of the different temperatures they were cooked at
This video was so helpful! I recently tried making some sugar wax at home. It was very dark in color but still really soft and almost runny. Your video answered so many questions I had. Thank you!
The recipe in description has different amount of liquid to sugar
Why doesn’t my sugar stick together (I got it out of the store) I can’t rip it off in one swoop like you did actually I can’t rip it off at all with my hand
just finished it cant wait to use it I was bouta spend 68$ on product and your video was in my recommendations and I'm amazed the product I was buying use the exact same ingredients too I'm excited to try it
Thank you so much for giving temperatures!
Unofficial rule of thumb...  If you have coconut oil and it liquefies in  spring and summer even with the AC on, go darker and harder on the wax sis. Don't waste half a bag of sugar like I did.  🥴  Lesson learned: shave my underarm and wait for the stubble, cuz those longer hairs... 😖
Me: I probably don’t need to be on meds for adhd anymore, I can totally manage it alone. Also me unmediated at 1am watching this about to wax my legs: 👁👄👁
Thanks so much! I always have a problem judging the right color because I use raw unbleached sugar. As you know, this means your wax ends up darker. Knowing the exact temperature is extremely helpful.
240
Show cold and warm video.
What’s the measurements? The description says 2 cups sugar, and half cups water/lemon. But in the video comparing to the dry sugar you said 2 cups sugar, and quarter cups lemon/water. I don’t want to ruin another batch!
This is exactly the kind of video I've been looking for! Thank you! First time doing a diy waxing (even just waxing from home) and this makes me more comfortable than just eyeballing a color. Thank you!
Here I was for months trying to get it right....  I was trying to use all of it without warming at all
i accidentally spilt the wax on the counter how do i get it out bc it hardened
If you have your sugar in a plastic container how do you warm it up without using a microwave? Wax plate or wax pot warmer? I feel like the plastic container will melt
It actually worked for me the first time finally thanks to u! But it's soooo sticky I can barely use it without going everywhere on my fingers .. and when I try to use wather first, it won't stick at all and kind of melt? I'm so done 😭😭 I really want to use it but it's just not working help.
Opening narration- “…is making you want to pull your hair out?” 🤔🤨🤷🏻‍♀️ Isn’t that the *entire point*? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣👌🏽😆😉💋 Very punny, doll!! Love it. I’m otw to kitchen right now. 🤓💪🏽💋🔮⚖️
@abetweene
why is my wax hard and all over the place in the cup it’s not as neat as in here ??? also the wax was at room temp after the wax got cold (room temp) from leaving it in my room for a little bit
Okay, I think I undercooked mine, could I just boil it again? I used cane sugar so it got darker a little faster I think? But it’s still runny like.
I love that pot, do you know I can kind the same one or similar ?
Yep tried it yesterday and it was lemon candy that I ate 😂
Awesome channel
Can I put this in the refrigerator?. Mines is clumping but its not getting to the opaque color
I just seen this video and It help soooo much!!! Thank you so much for making these and doing all that research!!
I always get red bumps after sugaring my neck (pcos). I moisturize with jojoba oil after. What can I do to prevent this?
What to do with undercooked patch? Can i save it or i need to do a new patch?
I was like okay this is easy but I don't have any lemon juice or calamansi amma just use water and sugar ain't gonna bad happened right?   Well my dumb ass did it and I freaking regret it.
Your videos are straight to the point and informative. You are also really good at explaining this stuff in a non-intimidating way. Thank you!!!
I came across your video a while back. I made some wax using your recipe and it was GREAT! I’m all out of wax and I just spent 3 hours looking for your video! Thank you for this video. I love you for it!
I would love to know where can I find those containers to store the sugar wax
I tried to do it last night and I am very bruised now. Arg. Definitely messed up
i cant BELIEVE i got it right the first time, I was so scared of it burning or something but i managed to make a soft paste with an amazing texture that is so easy to use! thank you so much! this just made my life so much easier
Hey there! Where did you get the containers from?
hey, really nice videos! I tried your methods and I was able to make the wax, but it hurt too much and I couldn’t get all the hair out so I ended up just eating the wax
How to not let lots of bubbles come in your wax after you put it into a container.
I literally can't ever get this right. It always turns hard and don't know what to do 😭
5:26 does anybody know how much the temperature for this consistency????
Too much talking and too many option's. I'm confused not trying to be mean. Can you make a simple video for just the sugar wax that you use with a strip pls???
Hii !! Just a couple questions ! How long do you wait before pouring it into those plastic containers? I bought some of those microwavable plastic containers to make a few batches in bulk. Also what temp can I set my wax pot to to heat them up?  Thanks sooo much in advance !! <3
Can you please tell me why my solution is getting hard like a candy when it is getting cold , when it's hot it's liquid , but I can't apply that much hot thing in face , kindly help
What if I don't have  a thermometer 🌡️
Thank you so much for the sugar thermometer tip, I've been using mine wrong, must be why this is the only sugar wax that I got right... anyways, thank you again. I got it Righht! 🥺
What do you do if you over cook ?
Hi, i have cook the sugar to 240F for a soft ball but the color is white and liquidy. What did i do wrong?
Omg thanks for this video! I live in the Caribbean and your video explained everything I was doing wrong. Thanks again you're awesome!
I just made some and the consistency seems about right, I'll try it in a bit. My parents are out so I rushed to make some wax lmfao
Should we need to apply wax after few mins of heating...after cooling foen becomes thick..only when its hit i can apply..and its very painful😢what should i do?
I tried this sugar wax but every Time i try to wax it melts coz I live in very hot climate so what should I do
Can you sell me some? Because I just can't.
i made it and it kinda worked but when i try to mold it and then use it, it sticks really bad to my skin and hair. any tips?
Hi thanks for the info I was hoping to see a video or you mentioning what happens if you undercook your batch what if it's not runny but not as firm either how do we eliminate the excess water to make it candy like?
So in other words you can't really go wrong with this haha nice 👌
Hi I'm late to the party, but here now just sugar waxing for the first time! Great video BUT I am on batch number 2 and the consistency is still thin.....Please HELP. My first batch I have put in the fridge hoping that helps it harden. x
This is so informative, wow! I made a batch without watching this and oh how I failed... Can't wait to try this method! 😊
I’ve tried 5 times. Lol the pandemic made me lazy.
Wait?! What? Your recipe in the description is different from the one your  mentioning at 2:04. Which should I use? 2 cups  of sugar + 1/2 cup of water + 1/2  cup of lemon or 2 cups of sugar +1/4 cup of water + 1/4 cup of lemon.
Hey! Can i make this without lemon juice or use another thing instead? Thank you
Hello,I've tried  your recipe about 4-5.. I did right the last time but It turns into a "stone" when it is cold.. what can I do for this?
I do the sugar wax and always get the undercooked stage, but for me it's okey cuz I prefer removing hair with strips.  Maybe I'll buy a candy thermometer, for getting the firm ball
Thicker then a bowl of oatmeal 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I tried mine. Right thickness, firm just like a candy but when I put it on me it turns sticky. I can't pull it out at once. I just pull it from all sides and wash the rest out. Someone please tell what I'm doing wrong.
Hi, will you still be making a video for each kind of sugar? Maybe they're already on your channel and I can't find them. Very possible 🙆🏼‍♀️ Anyways thanks for all your videos on this topic. Subscribed and staying tuned!
D: mine keeps ending up like hard candy, I hope that using the temperatures will keep that from happening!
Can you put it back on the stove after it cools and reheat it to get it firmer?
Thanks for all the efforts into making all these awesome videos!!! Wish me luck I’m making it tmr!!!
Thanks for this.  What type of plastic containter do we need to get to use in the wax warmer?  I've seen some containers with numbers on the bottom.  Which number do I get if it matters?  I'm sure it does. lol
Not me melting my lemon drops...
What's the right temperature you didn't save the number
Can you overcook it? I tried to make sugar wax and it definitely was NOT the 2nd consistency, I used your bowl-of-water test to rapidly cool it. It was similar to or harder than the 3rd consistency you showed in this video. I thought it wasn't good anymore so I tossed it; but would I have still be able to use it as a cold wax after Store&Pour and then reheated like in a microwave?  Or should I have used it ASAP with fabric strips (once cool enough) before it reaches its true consistency, and not as a cold wax? Or does something about overcooking it make it lose its sticky/waxing properties?
I found the right recipe but I didn’t understand what I was doing this video is what I should have watched
Man i got it perfect in the first try and finished one of my hands and now I'm trying to do it again for my other hand and the sugar just keeps getting too hard,, NOW I HAVE ONE HAIRY HAND AND ONE HAIRLESS HAND HRIEJDWIUEJEEI
THICKER THAN A BOWL OF OATMEAL 😂
Oh angel. Why i only found you now!!! Love love videos
How!!!
Here's a short review:- Pros: Natural, no irritation, not painful, edible & inexpensive. Cons:  Sticky & messy. Method without strip: complicated for beginners, but you will get used to it. Gave a patchy result(I'm a beginner at waxing, this is my second time waxing). The method with the strip: convenient, not patchy, no bits of hair left on the waxed area.  My skin feels soft and I am satisfied with the results. It wasn't that hard to make. The right consistency & proper application will give you the best results. At first, the wax was hard and I was able to wax one underarm without using any wax strip(cloth). By the time I finished one underarm, the remaining unused wax started to melt(runny) and become sticky. I reheated that for about 20 seconds, it was still soft(not runny) & sticky. This time I used a wax strip and the result was flawless.
Hey! I was always so embarrassed by my facial hair! I tired it alot for sugar wax ! But once I used jaggery instead of sugar and cooked for a very long time! And I'm totally satisfied with it! First time worked very well out.. but the 2nd time I'm not able to do it! I used a cotton cloth but it's not working  Can u please tell me what do I do with this problem please 🙂
I am here after falling on a loop of my extreme failure..going to eat like a candy tho
This tew much where can I buy it?
when i cooked my sugar after it cooled down a bit it got rock solid and i coundt do anything with it :c
How long after sugaring for hair removal do you need to repeat the process for the next time? How long before you have to do it all again? 1 week? 2 weeks? 4 weeks? Longer?
Could you directly microwave the jar you're using to store the sugar with the sugar?
I don't have a food Thermometer, guess I'll have to stick to 5-7 minutes or eyesight
Ty!
Can you just use a microwave to warm up the sugar ?
Sooooo what if I don't have a thermometer😅
Ok hopefully someone can help a sista out! But when I try to kneed it on my fingers it starts melting and becoming sticky. It’s rock hard on the container so I don’t understand
I did the soft one and it is waaay to soft. Seconds on my skins are enough to melt it so it doesn't come off clean with the help of fabric. Handling it with bare hands is impossible even if it is hard after i take it out of the fridge. Eventho i cooked it over 116°c cos the color wasn't right. My hair is thicc so i struggled a lot. Maybe my food thermometer is broken, maybe it's still too warm even if it's quite ok, or maybe i'm just too hot lol.  I will definitely cook it longer next time
Why isn't the wax sticking to my body 😭🗿
i made this 4 times i cant get this shit to work
Thank you for this life saver.
I don't have temperature meter
After three tries, fourth time the charm ! Don’t trust the colour guys, trust the temperature, and the trick of dropping some sugar on a frozen plate to see if it’s ready works wonders. Thanks for the recipe !!
And if you wanna remove your teeth just put you spoon right back, let it crystalize, harden and then chew sweetie
I got this up to the right temperature but it's not thickened at all and the colour isn't nearly as golden .. help!
I can only shave my legs from knee down.. If I use a razor any higher I get painful ugly bumps on thighs and bikini zone. Im about to try and sugar wax the area for the very first time with ur recipe. Wisn me luck! 🤞
If you've made it too thin but cooled it down, can you recook it to thicken it up
Thank you!!! Your videos are really informative!!! I haven't tried it yet but just curious, which method would you say hurts the least?
this helped clear up SO much!! I was so worried ab turning mine hard (bc of the horror stories in the comments) that I undercooked it and it remained runny and unuseable. I guess I’ll just have to put my botched batch into some tea or somthing. ty for this! ur saving me so much trial and error that I just dont have time for atm.
Ok I made this but here’s what happened, I cooked it to like 249-250 i could pick it up but immediately when it came in contact with my skin it was melting. Any tips?
This is a tutorial(it's a little long but worth it)   So this is my second time making this wax using your method and I have came out successful both times on the first tries and I've tried it with both white and brown sugar.   Hopefully this method I used would help beginners who don't have a thermometer like me.   First of all the color DOES NOT matter don't measure by that and brown sugar will be very similar to the white sugar when made properly.   1.Use the same measurements in the video double it you need more or less completely up to you. 2.Make sure you have a bowl of very cold water add ice just to be sure. 3.Make sure you have a container of room temperature water close by as well to wash your spoon.  4.The most important step is to make sure your stove is on the lowest it can go it's going to take longer to cook but it will reduce your chances of burning your sugar especially if it's your first time.  5.Add all your ingredients to your pot mix it and place on the stove, rinse the spoon before you put it back in again. You can wait a little while before mixing again you constantly mix when the mixture is starting to bubble. Once you mix and there is sugar crystals still on the spoon rinse it off only when it's bubbling and all the crystals are gone you can keep it in continuously without rinsing.  6.The mixture will bubble up high in the pot and once it does just remove it from the heat until it goes down and put it back on.  7.To make sure you get the perfect wax every time once you take it off the stove to let the bubbles go down you will take some of the mixture and pour it in the cold water. I would test mines everytime I took it off the heat and the bubbles went down.  8.If you are testing it like me everytime the bubbles appear and go down the first few times the mixture will completely disappear in the cold water that means it's undercooked and not ready so just place it on the heat and keep going.  9.Now because you are using it on the lowest heat it will take a long while and seem tiring but it is worth it trust me.  10.It is important to take it of the heat to check it so that you don't burn the moisture so just the check it in the cold water before placing on the heat again.  11.At some point when you pour it in the ice water you will notice that it stays on the bottom but when you grab it you'll be unable to pick it up because it's too soft. You can stop there if you are making a stip wax and just pour it into your container to cool.  12.If you don't want a strip wax and a soft wax instead keep going until the mixture is able to be picked up from the water and for a ball that is soft to spread just pour in your container to cool and that's it.  13.If you want a firmer wax just leave it longer until the mixture is at the firmness you want when you pick it up. And that's it just pour it in your container and you can leave it too cool and  if you follow these steps correctly you will get the perfect wax everytime.
Tip for anyone who like me has a short thermometer which became too hot to hold close in the pan: I stuck the thermometer metal thingy through a spatula so that the display could rest on the spatula and was able to hold it safely away from me in the pan
I tried to knead it the first time but it still solidified completely and wasn’t stretchy at all
If we realized after the sugar has cooled down that it was undercooked and a little too runny, is it possible to reheat it via stove or microwave to try and get it to a more cooked stage? Last time that I made it too runny I just used strips, but I really want to get it hard enough to just use fingers
What if I dont have a thermometer 😭😭
About the pour and store: how long should I wait after taking the pan from the fire to pour  it in a container? Cause I imagine it would melt it if I do it straight away, but I'm also afraid of the wax hardening in the pan
what do you do when ur sugar melts on ur skin? it’s so hard when i take it out but always ends up sticking to my skin and melting
Beginner here, so if I use a thermometer I don’t have to whisk. Otherwise I do? Is this method the best one? I’m so intimidated bu it still. I bought some sugaring paste but when ever i try the folding it just gets so liquid and sticky. So i just applied and started which somehow worked 🤣
Heya! Great vid! So if the mixture is too hard. How do I knead it to apply? I live in hot country as u were talking about
Hey abetweene :) I have a quick question about this. Will it work the same with brown sugar or does it have to be granulated white sugar?
Where can I find these storage containers? Looked everywhere!!
when i tried the first one i made the mistake of using too much water while kneading. i will try this no knead method next. thanks for sharing your recipes. ❤️
you probably wont see this since this vid is so old but is there any way to salvage wax that you mixed too much water into during kneading?
I live in a sub tropical country and it's usually around 30°C during the summer season. I think I will go with the firm sugar wax. Also thanks a lot for uploading this second video💜💜
How long did you have it on the stove?
How is it that there was a dark undercooked wax. It seemed darker than the 'soft' proper wax but was still way undercooked. I'm asking bc it's my first time making this and this is exactly what happened. The colour send to be getting dark and I got scared since most people warn against overcooking it but I as I knead it, it just makes in my hand. How can I ensure it cooks correctly?
Husband walked over at time marker 3:32 and said “ now you’re watching how to make caramels?? I thought you were figuring out how to make wax?” LOL
I'm am so grateful for these videos. Love from Ontario Canada 🇨🇦❤
Are we supposed to store wax in the fridge?
Watched all of your sugaring videos and successfully did it for the first time! Thank you you rock!
Celsius degrees Soft ball 112-115 C° Firm ball 118-121 C° Hard ball 121-129 C°
Can you apply it on more sensitive areas?
How to make it without a thermometer..??????. Please....
So the longer you cook the suger the harder it gets when it cools or does it make it softer ?
So if we have a wax warmer to reheat the sugar wax & turn it back into a liquid-ish stage to use the wax strips... does it matter if we make firm or hard stage wax to begin with? Because I noticed that soft wax isn’t strong enough for the hairs.
MY SUGAR IS SO STIKKY 😭
I saw your original sugaring video and got super ambitious and tried it right away. Of course I failed and then luckily I accidentally discovered this video! Hoping it’ll go better next time I try. Thanks for the tips!
Can I use baby oil to sooth?
somebody could tell me please, why I can't make it? I cooked it twice, first time it was uncooked, this time it looks cooked but when I try to wax, I can use the paste for one strap because then it immediately heats up with the contact of skin and it becomes unusable. What I have to do? Do I have to cook it again? Please note that I don't have  a termomether.
Why does my wax always turn out wrong?! First time it was too soft, second was wayyy too hard, this time I actually measured the temp and cooked it to 240, again way too soft and even looked too light.
How long does the sugar last?
I just failed it and now am watching it again
Okay, so once my cousin and I made a wax and it grew real hard as it cooled. So we had to throw the whole thing away.
You're awesome.  Am here for advice.
I have no idea how to keep it the same heat and make it brown
I am training to work out of sugar wax place and oh my God it’s horrible they use medium wax for everything and it’s too sticky and gets too hard idk how to manipulate it and it hurts clients so bad ah
I love your videos, thank you for sharing your knowledge with us!! They are full of information and helpful! If I may, I share also my experience: I tried many recipes and many kinds of wax colours and time etc and I had succes replacing the lemon juice with citric acid (you find it at baking shelf in store) and using the thermometer ( a cheap one - 5$ ). The 250 F temperature is best for me and very easy to work manually.
Thanks for your tips ❤️
for how long can we store the wax
Your voice over says to use 1/4 cup water and lemon juice but the description says 1/2 cup. Which measurement should I use ?!
Can you do soft sugar wax for thick/coarse and for Brazilian
I did this and made it too soft, but used it with strips and it works like magic. Down there, the pain is not that bad, I swear waxing hurts a lot more. I'm making another batch today. I saw sugar wax in the store, about 200 grams for qbout 10$. 😂 Nah, I'm going to make my own.
when i knead mine, it becomes rock solid
I legit just started a fire on my glass top trying to make this .better luck next time
Can you use this type of sugar wax for a brazilian?? With the strips though..
If I were to divide the recipe in half would it still work?
Love this video
GAME CHANGER:SET A 7-MINUTE TIMER IF YOU DONT HAVE A THERMOMER AND COOK ON MEDIUM TO LOW HEAT
It don’t work
can i use a meat thermometer? i waited kept boiling until its 245-250f (with double ingredients) and it came out kind of weird and sticky (and there's dried froth on top too).
I did it today and I got it on the second try thanks to your first video... I doesn't hurt that much I haven't wax my legs like never, and it's so easy
How can I do the hard wax without using a thermometer? I live in a tropical country so I think that would be the best for me
I did 1 cup to 14 water 1/4 lemon and then she said 2 cups to 1/4 each and i was like... Ah man. Then I saw the description and was right so now I have a huge batch started haha
So I’m guessing I can’t just go get some caramel candy, heat it up, and wax with it
Waste of time and money and what a mess... Just buy an epilator
In the video you said 2cups of sugar, 1/4 water and 1/4 lemon juice. In description it says 2cups of sugar and 1/2 water, 1/2 lemon juice. I tried by description it too watery. Did I just waisted so much sugar???
How long do I have to wait for it to cool down to use it
ive been sugaring for a long time but your videos have such great tips and i love the no kneading recipes. what kind of container exactly do you use for the wax warmer, is it like a soup takeout container? definitely would save my pot from getting as sticky lol
Is okay to use orange juice
Thanks mam
i thought i had completely burnt my sugar wax. it's definitely at firm stage and just solid in the jar. i've been carefully using a hot knife/spoon to pry out little bits at a time and then knead. once kneaded, i wrap in waxed paper and boom! ready to go.
God has great plans for you! You are excellent and excellence is one of his attributes!
After the sugar is done cooking and you remove it from the stove do you pour it into the container while its still super hot or you you let it cool in the pot then pour it into the container??
Why does her pfp look like Bella poarch???
I’m a guy but have terrible eczema/dry skin.  I tried out sugar wax on a bit of my arm and when I tell you it helped!! But I’m. I did the wax wrong so I used up a cup on like 6 inches on my hand 😭😭. This time it’s a BIT to wet but so I went with it haha.  I warmed it and used a stick to spread thin layers then I used literal paper to rip it off cause my hands and cloth would just not work. So I’m using old used paper 🤣😭 then I just shower and use a mild oat body wash and to top it off Rubbed it with coconut oil lmao. (It was the thick liquid one you Had)
Wait can u make it without lemon ?
Dear Lily,  Thank you very much for all the huge amounts of energy, time, money and effort you have invested to experiment. I had given up after having tried and failed many times. You have given me renewed hope.
I tried this and got the temperature to 240 based on my thermometer...it was black and set off the fire alarm (: I think my thermometer is broken...should’ve just taken it off when it turned colour
Or got stuck everywhere
Where can I buy those containers?
Can i eat it?
Permanent hair removal
So I’m using brown sugar, it’s been on the hob for about 8mins on medium/low heat (3) and it still hasn’t bubbled... what have I done wrong lol or is it just the sugar I am using ?
i made it yesterday for the first time and it worked lmao i cant believe it 😭😭 tysm 💗 i live in a warm climate and the wax leaves oily(?) residue but i just use cornstarch on my hand all the way during waxing and its easier.
I found a spatula that has a candy thermometer that fits into it, and it helps so much!
Can we pour the hot liquid in a plastic cup like u showed or does it HAVE to be in a glass jar
Can you tell us what a cup means? Like how much ML is it? Cup is Americana nd not precise
I'm not sure if anyone knows this but candy likes to pull moisture from the air and it will "sweat" if you live in a rainy climate or if it just rain outside. So if it is sticky after some time and you know you cooked it correctly, this may still happen!
Hi! Really good content! How can you put it on a plastic container, without it melting?
So do you use any preservatives ?
Someone pls save me. She said “1/4” in the video and listed 1/2 in the description. What do i do?!
where do you get those plastic containers that you can heat?
no matter what i do, my wax is always hard after i store it. like candy hard. even when i only heat it until it barely gets any color at all
So I used white sugar & organic lemon juice extract and I noticed that I had to cook longer 🤔 anyone else have this problem?
Hi, I like your content.. and I do have a question for you... At 5:29 , may I know the perfect temperature to make that wax? I prefer using with wax strip and I would like to know the temperature so I can give a try .. thank you for sharing btw!!♥️
Where did you get those plastic containers?
I lowkey did the recipe in the last video and did a full brazillian, I think it was ok 😳
I just wasted my sugar 😫😫😫 I feel guilty   Edit: I'm 15 so ughh I'm in trouble cuz I wasted sugar and it's a half cup 😫I feel so guilty
Is it two cups sugar and 1/2 water & 1/2 lemon OR 2 cups and 1/4 water & 1/4 lemon  because the recipe is different from what was said in the video ? Help
Would Turbinado  sugar be cooked to the same temp? I still see sugar graduals after cooking it to the temp of firm.
Is it supposed to leave sticky residue
I misread 240F to 340F and burned the hell of out the kitchen . So now I have to find a way to clean all the burned hard as rock sugar on my moms favorite saucepan... should’ve have read twice
This works! I followed this method and it actually worked! 🤯 Thank you!
I tried making sugar wax today and when it cooled it turned out to be so opaque and powdery.. it was more like powder than like a paste or syrup of any kind. I dunno what I did wrong. Please help! 😩
I tried to make this and heated to 116c and it is really blonde 😣
Her videos are awesome ! Yes you WILL go thru trial and error but OVERALL GREAT CONTENT! I will continue to wax at home and only occasionally see a wax specialist for my 🐱 Thankyou for great knowledge!!
So the temperature after cooking doesn't have any affect right?
Can u cook it in wax warmer
Can you lime juice if you don’t have lemon juice??
mine just hardens as soon as i take it off heat. what am i doing wrong?😭😭
You can also use the water to increase the temperature flout between the heater and container likely like Banja Marie 👌
So from a culinary standpoint, for less variables it's best to use bottled citrus juice instead of fresh if the primary purpose of adding the citrus is because you need the citric acid for a specific reason as opposed to simply wanting something to be citrus flavored. The reason being, bottled lemon juice for example, will have a consistent pH where fresh lemon juice will have varied water & pH content which will absolutely affect the outcome, yielding inconsistent results. This is especially true when making confections (which is essentially the base for sugar wax. . .Soft/Hard Ball caramelized sugars). The temperature is extremely important to getting the desired viscosity, but achieving the specific temps doesn't matter if your carbohydrate:acid & moisture content aren't within a certain range when combined (I don't know the specific ratio... I just kind of know what the mixture is supposed to look like prior & post caramelization). It's most certainly a chemical reaction, but is very much an art at the same time. If you go about this with the mind set that you're making either Soft or Hard Ball sugar, I think it might help some people. Most candy thermometers (some sized diameter glass tube about 5" long with a metal tip on the end and a clip on the other to secure it to the pot's rim) come with instructions or are labeled on the guage itself as to what temp each type of sugar confection desired should be brought to in order for the necessary chemistry magic to occur to achieve that type of candy. That's about all I've got and if I'm wrong about any of this then lmk how I was wrong and what the correct information is so that I don't misinform anyone else in the future. Cheers!
Have u sold these yet!???
If your sugar is undercooked, can you put it back in the pot and cook it some more? Or just start over?
You deserve a hundred million subs. Youre content is so amazingly simple yet comprehensive and informative. Its fun to watch and still so so educational. Im sooooooo happy I found you
I made two batches, both failed. undercooked and over cooked 🤧
Finally a defensible use of cane sugar that does not involve eating any of it!
Ok but at 2:50 your pulling the hard wax and softening it but it doesn’t even get soft when I do that’s uggg
You’re insanely good in waht you do!
Do you have a link to the bowls you are using to store it?
Tried to make my first sugar wax today and I dont know what I did wrong! It was super thick, wouldn't spread on my body and would harden super quickly :( really want to get into sugar waxing as elipating is hell for me.
Hi Abetweene, i tried doing cold sugar, when i pour into the glass jar, the wax is bubbly on the surface  and it does not dissapear even after i let it cold. It is working good, it’s just... not looking good.
Melhor panela pra fazer: alta Mais dura é melhor pra quem mora no calor Passar óleo no conteiner onde vai ficar
Someone tell me that sugar wax can darken armpit?is it true?
Can u use a green lemon? Lol
when using brown sugar how would you know when to take it of the stove because i don’t have a thermometer to test the temperature but i want the sugar to be around soft and firm , any tips or advice??
is the cold sugar wax stored in the fridge?
- Wow
Idk why the 1/2 cup of lemon and water is too much. On the other recipes she shows 1/4 cup  I had to correct it by leaving it on the stove longer past the recommended temp
Mine keeps turning out liquid-y, why? 🥺
At 2:00 you said 1/4 cup but in the description it's 1/2 cup so which one is it?
Guess I undercooked mine. It was more of a strip wax, but I was impatient because it took forever just to get to that stage
Is that painful?
If i add too much water and lemon to my sugar wax but have it at a firm ball temperature will it still be a syrup or with it form to wax
when do you put the syrup in there and can you substitute the syrup for honey ??
Obsessed now.... thank you !
The ones that failed to be my sugar wax will be given to children during halloween 🎃 trick or treatttttt
What’s the measurements for the soft wax
Can I use the firm wax without cloth?
YOU ARE SAVING MY LIFE, MY GOODS, ANNNND MY BANK ACCOUNT!!!!! T___T TYTYTY!!! I've been waxing myself and getting professionally waxed for 10 years.... and SUGAR WAX has been the LEAST PAINFUL experience I've ever had....and the quickest. I'm not exaggerating either... because I JUST WAXED MY QUARANTINE GOODS WITH THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I HAVE BEEN REBORN :D lol... xxo thanks!
Wait... in the video she says 1/4 c water And lemon and in the description it says 1/2 c each???
Thank you so much for your videos. They are very informative, you have such a nice voice and wonderful way of explaining yourself!
do we need to put the sugar in the fridge? or does it get hard by itself?
Hii !Actully i once did your sugar recipe and it work but the second it's was really HARD and all the previous ones too.However i did the same exact ingredients so maybe did i put too much sugar?
Hi. It's called halawa here in Africa. If you want to make the hard wax soft just put it in a hot water.
I wish I watch this earlier because I watch other channels and said if I overcooked mine it will never work. I wasted 1 cup of sugar already and there’s no citrus in here already but I really wanted to wax now 😕
Those plastic containers where can I get?
Thank you so much! I followed your instructions and I successfully removed my facial and neck hair. I'm so grateful.  Now, I made an absolute mess in my kitchen and bathroom. Hard sugar was everywhere. But it was worth it.
Thank you for this channel. I was able to make my own sugar wax and successfully did a Brazilian. You are a life saver!
I think this is excellent. Very comprehensive.
My wax turned soo hard???
Tried it today without a thermometer and it came out amazing, worked too. I've never even waxed before, today was my first time. Thank you
Can I use brown sugar? :((
🕊
I just wanna eat it 😩😂
Amazing video! Scientific 👌🏼
HELP ME PLEASE!  I know sugar waxing is the best way and it worked for me but not on my arms, the hair got thicker and when it grows i see some little black dots before it actually grows.
I followed this method, used a thermometer and everything, but how come mine turned out chunky and filled with bubbles? What does this mean what am I doing wrong? T.T
Bruh I tried this like 4 times failed and burned my finger 3 times 🥴.
So i got my sugar to the golden brown color, and it was hardening like you said, and then when it came time to mold (my sugar was getting stickier and was holding its shape pretty well), I started molding but it just starting getting more and more sticky and melting in my hands. Eventually it just completely turned into the earlier syrup like consistency. Is there any way to salvage it once that happens? Was the issue that I added too much water to my hands, or the temperature of my room, or that I started molding too early? I can't figure it out
Damn corona. Abetweeene teach me your ways please ❤️❤️
I don't know but I think the recipe in the Video description is not accurate. It says that you need 2 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of lemon juice. But I think it should be 2 cups of sugar and 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  Am I wrong?
Can I use lime instead of lemon?
I did it!!!!!!!
After letting mine cool, it was extremely sticky when taking it out of the container. It was all over my hands and I could not mold it at all (yes, I cooked it to 240). Did anyone else have this issue?
I want to eat it
Do I have to do anything differently if using brown sugar?
Then how to fix the watery content over hard wax, actually when I made hard wax few days later I found it watery layer over it making it useless. Is my wax gone to be waste ? 😭 What should I do plz kindly guide
Do you have to use lemon juice? If so what is it for
Lol I just came from that video and I ended up tossing it. I will keep trying for sure. Sugar waxing is my only hope since razors and hair removal creams burn my skin.
I really don't understand how is her wax is not rock solid after cooling down , I could only heat up my sugar and it would turn into a rock solid form when it cools down I really don't understand
Making sugar wax is hard. Everything bubbled over, I burned myself, and my wax is dumb dark. I think I burnt it.  Just a bit frustrated.
I love this thank you
This garbage is not working for me. I’m a real woman with pcos and need a good recipe. My hair is growing in and I can’t get my hands on wax strips right now. Someone PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE link me to a professional and fool proof recipe that actually removes hair.
New Subscriber. 😊😍 thanks for the awesome content 🙏
How long is the shelf life after making it? Waxing while during quarantine here😂
You are the complete BEST!
Did 240- 246 ish and it looks sooo light still. Cut your recipe in half and used 1c sugar, and 1/4 lemon and water
Do we have to have lemon juice? I don't have any ;^;
Hey I don’t see the containers you used for storing on you kit page... can you please drop the link? Thanks!
I’m going on vacation in 3 days and I don’t wanna spend money on wax so I’m gonna do this lol
Not working. Failed me everywhen. Hoped it'd extricate me from threading.  P. S. Will have to go back to threading my upper lips :(
I cooked my wax to 266 degrees but when it cooled it was very sticky and slimy still
What if u don't have a thermometer
I’ve tried several of your recepies and they didnt work... this one was way undercooked...
And I dropped my thermometer in the sugar 🤦🏽‍♀️
Love that you broke this down by temp. Doing my first batch tonight 🤞🏽 hope it turns out right!
How long will this last? Pls answer
Where do you leave the containers to let the sugar harden, does it go in the fridge or do you just leave it out? :)
The supplies in the description says 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup lemon or lime juice. I did this and it’s too watery. Then in the video it says 1/4 cup. Which is it?
I tried make it two times and still failed
your explanation is really great
Now I have something to do with the sugar that I don't use.
We love a YouTuber who gets right into it!!!
Mix your sugar water and lemon juice 🍋
If undercook it can I just boil it more to get more water out or do I have to start on a whole new patch
Thank u so much for detailed explanation..I find hard wax (240-245f)very easy and effective..results are amazing especially in warm days of summer..lots of love from Pakistan 💓💓💓💓
well i tried... followed every step and as i was kneading it turned hard as rock.. i guess i need a wax burner.
so i just tried this and every time i tried to kneed the wax or use the wax in general it would get super melted and gooey and not come off of my skin when i tried to remove it. so then i used cotton and when i ripped it off it barely got any hair off???? any tips?? i refrigerated the wax too to see if that would help and it didn't
I just made some sugaring paste with your help. It turned out perfectly the first time. Thank you so much.
I made it for the first time and it turned out really good. It waxed well
I made some and it tasted like a bit o honey the candy
Mine came out like the dark one and it’s a bit firm but seems usable.... can I microwave it to soften it ? I don’t have a wax melter🤷🏿‍♀️
Excellent explanations! Thanks! I am using sugar wax 30 years. I use to make 1 time monthly. Now at 59 ( age)I do every 2 months.My face only.   Good job!!!! Good luck ladies!!! 😊😊😊
I got the wax to 245 but it’s still clearish
I'm trying to build up some courage before I wax my vagina. Send prayers 🙏
Hello! I cooked it to 250 F and left it overnight and it isn’t as hard as yours. Should I place it in the fridge ? Or how do I get it harder. Thank you!
This is amazing, years i could not figure out how to make sugar wax, well now i can, thank you
How long do i keep it on the stove?
SO you can eat it, before you use it, dont ask why im here
What should I do if it’s too runny?
Somewhere here I read NOT to use it on the face?  Why not
Thank you so much for this video!! I've made 4 batches and failed at all of them.. the problem was when I started to knead, it would just melt in my hand. I live in texas and its freaking HOT here. Even with the air conditioner on and a fan blowing at me it would just turn into syrup. Well 5th time is a charm. I coocked it to 255 f and let it sit for like 5 hours. And miracle happened!! The whole kneading happens when you start using it on yourself. And now legs are hairless!!! THANK YOU!!
Mine came out as  hard rock ball.. it was a total  fail
Soooo what if the wax is super dark ? Can I still use it ?
Do you have any recommendations for a brand to purchase for sugaring, I have tried for a week to make mine and failed every time?
🙏🏻❤️
trying this a third time after finally getting a cooking thermometer but my sugar mixture looks very light, it doesn’t even have the butterscotch color you described in the faq video.. yet it reached the exact temperature needed to reach a firm ball stage? is this normal? like will it darken over time? should I keep it in a fridge?
Is this OK to use on eyebrows and lip
Anyone else having trouble getting it to the correct temperature with an induction stove? I can't get it higher than 230°F / 110°C and then it just turns blackish...
Would it be best to use a candy thermometer
I followed instructions from your other video and cooked my sugar to 116 C.. and omg IT FINALLY WORKED! Buying a thermometer made it easy to understand when to remove my pan away from the stove!
Is it possible to not use lemon during the whole process.. I mean if you don't have lemon... Can you make the wax without lemon.. Hope u answer my question.. And have a nice day ❤️❤️❤️
Your voice is so soothing💛
Can you eat it? Just asking haha
Hi, hope you’re doing well. Just 1 question,  just to make sure i do it right. On this video it says 2 cups sugar on one of your others it says 1. Which is it? Or which works better?
So how do you get the firmer sugars back to a pliable and usable consistency?
I know I'm late, but I noticed this video description says 2 cups of sugar, and your other video says 1 cup sugar. Both say 1/4 cup each lemon juice & water. Which is correct, 1C or 2C of sugar?
How come now we’re using 2 cups of sugar instead of 1 cup??
If ur sugar is under cooked u just throw it away? Is there any way to reuse it or make it able to become better to wax
What if u don’t have a thermometer.....cuz I dont
Such a helpful video! I used it last year and made a hardball wax. I opened it up this year and just used it all up so I’m back for another batch. I’m in cleveland where summer is hot and humid so hardball was great for me! AND it stores well! Thank you!!
I live in 30C room temperature, so what kind of Wax should I Make?
👏WHAT👏HAPPENED👏TO 👏LEMONADE👏 SAVE👏IT. 👏FOR 👏LEMONADE
No need sugar wax?
Im quite scared cuz we dont have a lemon juice here but a vinegar :((
I made this twice. The first time I overcooked it so I threw it out. The second time I used a thermometer so it came out perfect. The only problem is that it sticks to my hands really badly so it's a mess of sticky caramel everywhere. What am I doing wrong?? Help 😕
For the bikini area, wich do u recomend me? The hard wax sugar or the soft one that uses a cloth?   Pd: sorry about my english, It's a lil broken but I think that I explained myself ❤❤❤ love your videos
can you use brown sugar?
Hi. I have tried this before and ended up with candy. So I'm going to try again. I'm going to do 116 degrees celius. But do you think I should knead it when it is cool so it's easy to use next time. This may be a silly question because you really do teach in detail. Maybe I missed that detail.
I undercooked mine first and second try 😅 thought it was ready cuz it overflowed.. Can I can cook it again but with more sugar or doesn’t it work like that? And what kind of strips did you use? Do you only use them for the thin, undercooked substance or also for the thicker ones?
my third time making it and i don't think i put enough lemon juice because i'm able to mold it but it doesn't stick to my skin it just rolls off 😭
I love your sugar wax videos!! just have a few questions... 1. If I make Soft Sugar then I'm able to use it when it's cold, but can I use it as as a strip wax sugar while it's still warm? 2. I tried making soft sugar using a thermometer, but when I reached 237F Wich is in the soft sugar stage it wasn't even close to soft sugar... I wasn't even close to strip wax sugar either... it's not particularly dry or humid where I live either... 3. in this video you say 2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup water and lemon... but in other videos you say 1cup sugar and 1/4 cup water and lemon... what is the right ratio? 1:0.5 or 2:0.5
In extra tips  When you under cooked the sugar  What was the colour of it when you turned it off  Also the temperature
So, is it safe to put the sugar in a plastic container right after you finished cooking it?
One of the best tutorials I’ve ever watched!
Hello. What is a good temp for strip sugaring wax.
Thank you for explaining each type, this was very helpful.
Can someone tell me when or rather if this sugar is expiring? How long can I store it?
hey i tried it making hard wax today as explained .however it didnot even stick to my skin ...what could  be the reason?
Having done the exfoliating and having clean dry skin....what would cause the sugar to not stick? It just slides off pretty much.
What's the point of kneading it and making it into a paste vs the pour and store?
This is THE BEST video I have seen on sugaring and sugar “wax”. Thank you!
Bout to get this quarantine coochie right!🤣
I very confused about this 🤦don't what to do 😔
i dont have a thermometer tho :(
Found this during quarantine. I’m not going to salon wax again. This makes the skin much more better.❤️
Hiii!😊 So I actually done this twice already and has lasted me about a whole year thanks to you🙌🏽. But recently I saw that I was running low and decided to make it again but a bigger batch. (3x) and something went wrong because the color was really dark and it was still really runny to the point that not even the strip could remove it. I tried again and the same thing happened. I made sure all my measurements were accurate and even used really lime juice as I did both times I did it. (Except the third time, here I am talking about the fourth try) My question is if when you see it boiling do you just keep it on the stove and stir it frequently or do you not stir it at all. I’m so confused as to what could have gone wrong.
if i dont have lemon juice what else can i use?
Hey, so I cooked my sugar to 260f and then let it cool in a glass container, then I put it in a plastic container and it firmed until the next day. Now it works when I use it but I notice that I didn’t knead it and when I use it, it gets sticky like it’ll come apart sticking around everywhere on my finger and the spot where I’m waxing. Should I knead it first before using it and also for the wax you did (250f firm stage)  can you warm that in a wax warmer and use it with strips?  The wax I have isn’t too hard or too soft it’s actually exactly like your firm one but it’s sticky after I apply it but I think it’s bc I didn’t knead it. Idk though. Thank you if you can give me some advice :) oh and when I do try to knead it, it gets sticky idk if that’s normal and I just need to continue to knead?
thumbs up! toes up! all up!! you're wonderful!!! new sub!! ;-)
Hello ma'am. My sugar wax can't make balls when put in cold water. Please help
Does this help "strawberry legs"? (Dark comedones on legs)
If I buy the paste as it is do I need to knead it first or do I go straight on to using it?
What temperature does it have to reach?
Ok so mine got to 240 degrees and turned amber and cooled but its still sticky
1st batch, pretty perfect and tried it right away on my armpit and : perfect !!!! works soooo well and less painful than at a beauty salon ! I'm sooo happy !
You're my life saver!! 😭 I made two batches of sugar wax and I haven't even failed, not even on my first try 😭 gosh two months w/o waxing salon bc of quarantine and my legs hairy af as hairy as my brother's legs 😩
Every time I made it it was always the “firm”🥺
it doesn't work for me . 🙄
I don’t have a thermometer. How long did it take for the hard wax to boil or reach the right temp??
i like my wax thick but runny so i can just apply it wish a stick then rip it off with a wax strip. Its just so much more easier to me x
hi! i have a question, lets say you undercooked the wax and poured it on a container already.. can you just reheat it on a pan in order for it to thicken even more? :)
Here because of quarantine
sooo I cooked mine to just about 245 degrees and it’s pretty soft/realllly sticks to my skin. I’m not sure how I can use it. Do i re-heat it? Any tips? haha, helllllp, removing my quarantine body hair is almost all I can think of.
IM USING THIS AS SLIME TY
I’ll just make it and eat it thank you very much
I trust you with my life
How do you store your sugar wax?
Ueje
Help! I cooked to 240 degrees but my sugar is much lighter. It’s still fairly firm to touch with the finger but can easily be pulled up between two fingers and pliable. Can I wax with it or do I need strips? My husband is letting me test on him! Lol
Will you get the same results using sugar in the raw?
Ahh I tried this and it took me three tries to get the right consistency but once I did, WOW! I have never waxed before but this worked so well ☺️🎉
If it become hard how i can thicken
Did it today and absolute love it! Your videos are so insightful, and the procedure is very gentle on my atopic skin. Love your channel!
I was making this and my brother thought it was wax glue for hair  or something so he used it and things didn’t go well that’s all I can tell you...
*SUMMARY*  - since I watched it 50 times: ••Using same supplies as before, listed in the description.  ~~ Similar directions to the first video~~ *Soft ball* (Temp: 235°F - 240°F) *Firm ball* (Temp: 245°F - 250°F) *Hard ball* (Temp: 250°F - 265°F) • Mix ingredients and place in a saucepan on medium heat. • Insert thermometer after it starts bubbling but dont let the thermometer touch the bottom.  • Pour n store, wait until the wax cools so you dont burn yourself ⤵️ • You can use cold wax right out of the storing container  • Kneading the sugar helps keep it malleable. • If you live in a hot climate, its recommended to use harder sugars so it doesnt melt right away.  • When kneading, don't use too much water it can dissolve the sugar. • You know its undercooked when  sugar is liquidy and runny.
Soooooooo helpful. My "wax" (syrup) is totally runny right now. I gotta get it harder. It was hard, but I thought it was too hard and diluted it 🙄
how long did you cook each type of sugar?
What if i use orange instead lemon ??
youre the first person who's actually given good advice, thAnk you
I had tried sugaring so many times, but it had never worked.  But this one worked!!! And now I have a burnt vessel and smooth skin. So yay!!!
This was my attempt and at the end I gave up and did candy with granola😂😂
What stage is best for bikini or under arm wax?
2 cups equal  how  grams??
I hate that despite your super detailed instructions and really helpful tips, I cannot get this right at all
ok so..if i undercooked the sugar..should i put it back in a pot and continue cooking it..or i can't use it anymore?
Hello! I have tried this several times and all of them were useless :( when it cools down it gets hard as candy, what am I doing wrong, or how can I make it softer?  Is there a way to fix it?
Can I just buy a bag of Carmel, melt and use💁🏽‍♀️?
It's really work
where the hair
Your tutorials are AMAZING. Excellent! Subscribed! Thank you!
I’m a tuff girl but I do have to say that sugaring hurts like hell😭I’m try hard wax next to see if it’s better
tried to make the soft one twice and both didn’t work... first one was like a grainy scrub and the second which i cooked to 240, was consistency of honey and wasn’t pliable or didn’t work with the strips either... why is this so hard
what is the best stage wax for leg hair?
I microwaved mine for the recommended time, and when it finally wasn't too hot for me to handle, it was very solid. Anyone know what I did wrong?
I just made mine and am going to let it cool :) My thermometer only reads to 220, so I just had to leave it cooking a little longer and kinda guess! If it turns out being undercooked, is it possible to put the same batch back on the stove to cook longer?
What's the longest amount of time you've stored it and where did you store it?
My sister and I agree, your voice would be great for a Google voiceover.
Can you add cocoa powder to this wax? I use it when strip waxing and it makes waxing less painful
Approximately how long should the mixture be on the stove for? I tried to make the cold wax and as soon as the thermometer hit 240°, I stirred it to check the consistency and it was so watery!
I waxed my vag. Its not that painful. It's tolerable. Anywat after that what i did is pat it with lukewarm water and applied aloe vera. Is that okay?
I almost overcook mine but it turns out that it’s okay. This recipe and tutorial is the one that I’ve been looking for!
Do you have to wait 7 days?
HEELLLPPP!! I’ve made like 6 different batches the first 5 no thermometer, I used the cold water trick. It would harden then as soon as I try to use it on my arm, it immediately goes stick and you would have to use a strip.  The batch I made last night- I used a candy thermometer, booked the syrup to “soft ball” stage...and still did the cold water trick AND IT STILL NEVER WENT STICKY OR BACJ TO SYRUP when I tried to use it. So I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds at a time x3 and until the thermometer read 250 degrees and then when the wax was semi cooked I took it to knead and it seemed to work... but again turned to syrup when I tried to use it!!! Then became too hard to knead after it cooled 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️😤😤😩😩😑.   I WANT TO GIVE UP- but I know I’m close... HELP ANYONE!!   Ingredients used:  Sugar in the raw (turbinado)  Lemon juice (bottled)  Water Directions above
Do you put the wax in the fridge to cool?
lmao it worked yay
I tried many time as you...I think i  need to buy thermometer
What different powders are safe to use?
You are the best
It is winter now where I am. I have made the soft paste but it has gotten quite hard now. Do I have to knead it now or can I just warm up the paste and use it?
i haven’t shaved since quarantine started & i wanna try waxing, but with stuff i already have at home. this is perfect!!
Guys my wax is so sticky how do I fix this it’s runny almost.
First attempt today, made it too soft between the second syrup and a soft wax, still worked but would warm up too quickly. I had cooked it to 240 but definitely needed to caramelize the sugar, so for me the color definitely mattered for me regardless of the temp!
So for the undercooked wax, which can be used for strips what temperature did you cook that one on?
So is it 1 cup of sugar to 1/4 lemon juice and 1/4 water or 2 cups of sugar to 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 water? You had 1 cup on other videos, but here you said 2 cups.
I bought a sugar wax and used it once and just put it on my dresser, but when I went to use it again it had become very runny and syrupy. Can I salvage it at all? Or should I throw it out?
What if I don't have a thermometer lol
quarantine brought me here.. 🌚
How long do you boil it?
What temperature is the “undercooked” one that you used with a strip? As id actually prefer to use that with reusable wax strips. X
where did you get your containers?
Is it two cups of sugar or one like in your other videos?
Mine turned into something like ruce
Got a bit frustrated after the two first attempts not really working the way they’re supposed to, but the third time was perfect :)) pulled almost every single hair out super effortlessly, and now after five days my legs are still just as smooth. it hurts a lot less than normal wax so it really wasn’t that painful at all. The only downside is that it’s quite a long process, but totally worth the time in my opinion. I recommend 100%!
Oh my god she literally described everything I failed to do when trying to sugar wax for the first time just now
can I use this mixture to do my eyebrows too?? lmao 😂
Which is better for more course pubic hair ? That will give you a nice clean surface?
Hi thank you 🙏 for this video I did this recipe and it works
Can you reheat the undercooked stuff to cook it to hopefully become soft ball?! 😅
so i was gonna make firm wax but it ended up being hard and can i just microwave it a lil bit so its easy to scoop out cuz i dont wanna individually wrap them like that. also its not really sticking on my skin when i try spreading it
Can you only use a plastic tub to store the cold wax ? ( the wax you can use without the cloth strips )
What temperature do you have the wax when you are using it for waxing?
I watched this and then tried to recreate from memory. It wasn’t a disaster and I was pretty entertained. Definitely not painful on legs and I have work to do to get the wax right to get a good grip on the hair. Looking forward to trying again and getting a little better every time.
What I can’t get with is these measurements? Are you saying 1/4 cup of water and lemon juice?
I had just tried to follow the sugar wax video but it ends up being too soft. Now i know that i had tried to kneaded it with too much water.   Another way i know is you mentioned if too mucb water, it'll absorb into the cloth and that's exactly what happened.   I'm a first timer in waxing and making my own wax, so i had no idea how it was supposed to be.   Thanks for this video. I'll try to boil it longer next time.
Wat does it mean after making it sugar wax wen I cooled it down and tried it only a few secs it became hard whilst I was testing it wat hve I done wrong ?
I don't have a thermometer to measure temp so how would I know when the sugar is done for firm ball to hard ball
I’m so blessed by your content and you’re such a great teacher, so patient with us. That’s real dedication to your subscribers. I just subscribed and filled you on Instagram :)
All the salons are closed!!!!!! and I failed at making my own wax twice!!!! Coronavirus,  please release us from your stronghold!!!!😢
How to make that upperlips wax you showed to apply?
Mine still seems to be too sticky and I have reduced the amount of water. I tried to cook a little longer and ended up with lollypop stage....any advice?
Is lemonjuice required?
What temperature do we have for the  stripsugar?
My sister reminded me about the sugar wax method and after a few searches online I found you account. Thank you for your videos, will definitely try this out. ☺️
what if the sugar dosent turn brown and it just stays white
By FAR THEEE MOST INFORMATIVE VIDEO TRYNA GET SOME TRADES WHILE QUARANTINED ! 😹😻😼
Can you do a video dedicated to hard stage sugar without using thermometer
So what do I do if it’s hard but leaves syrup behind on my finger?
I tried making my first batch and when it started to cool it stuck to the pan and since it's so hot idk where to pour it into, but I cant even pour it and it turned black so I think I overcooked it. My thermostat only goes up to 220 so I'm guessing here , also my house is smokey now from cooking the sugar lmao what did I do wrong . I just made a second batch and cooked it a lil less poured it into a metal mixing bowl lined with wax paper, I hope this works lol
Do you store this in the fridge at all? Or just keep it in a room?
finally someone that tells me that i undercooked mine
Where do you get these cloth pieces?
It looks tasty 🤤
How can I use my overcooked sugar plzz help
So helpful! Thank you
This is harder than I thought
I need a thermometer to do this perfect. I've seen all ur videos but it's hard to figure out which wax I have. I got second degree burn on back of my hands testing  it out but that's my fault just saying it's possible to burn urself testing the heat. That's amazing I can use that container to use wax warmer. Appriciate the videos n all ur knowledge. God bless XoJaynaoX
Can u use a nonstick sauce pan ?
Theoretically I could use caramel from the store
If i used fine sugar... is there anything i can do to make it work? T_T
Could I cook the sugar in the oven to get it to a specific temp? I don't have a cooking thermometer thing
If you dont have a wax heater can you heat it in a microwave?
I found that my thermometer was saying my wax was at temperature long before the liquid was even cooked off or it came to color.  Any advice on this?
Thanks it works
Never thought I will come back to this video because of a pandemic !
Does it hurt?? 😰
How often the hairs get re-Growth?
Now i'm in physical pain after trying this my hands and back hurts like hell😅i tried it for the first time i thought the wax was good at first but then it was hard to spread so it took me nearly 3h to wax my legs onlyy..after all PRETTY HURTS YAll sucks to be a girl
Anyone else here during quarantine trying to wax themselves? 😂
WOULDNT THAT GET U ALL STICKY???
Ok so strip wax is 230-235. So the wax that I want to pull off of myself without strips is the last 3 stages after strip wax? Also I want to do the firm and strip. I'm confused is it 2 cups or one cup for all plus the water and lemon? Thank you
Love this! You're very articulate and concise which I appreciate. You sound so official and scientific. You make the best sugar videos :)
Probably to “private” for youtube but i wish  I could see how this is on a bikini wax
Does it work with lime juice ?
🙌🏼😇TnxU
This wasn’t very helpful
I was looking at how to make caramel for baking, and when I was watching the beginning of this video I was wait what!?
Did a whole Brazilian wax with this let’s see how long this lasts ; thank you for this vid ❤️
Thanks my dear as a new wax technician I find that normal wax is too sticky for me. So was looking for a tentative’s learn about sugar wax I made your recipe the hard wax’s it very easy very simple to do and it works. And what I love the most is the cleanup just suck everything and water come back to it 10-15  minutes later and rinse off. 💋
Me wanting to do this but doesn’t have lemon juice or a Thermometer☹️
Can we just use water and sugar??
I never comment on videos but had to do it here! Self isolation led me here and although I was reluctant and didn’t have a thermometer I still managed to do the 116 degrees one, let it cool 1 day and used it on my armpit, bikini and legs....WORKED AMAZING! Watched 4 videos before actually doing it to make sure I had all the info on pre and post waxing. Thanks and great editing skills.
Currently self in quarantine focusing on self care and making my own products. Thank you for these videos
like kween!! 🙌🙌🙌 you just made my years of search answered. ❤️❤️
How many minutes do you cook each form of sugar wax for?
This actually worked the first time I tried it yay thanks for this video:))
I keep cooking it longer and it just keeps completely melting in my hands 😭😭😭
Okay so I’ve tried this and I followed all the steps to a perfect T and when I went to use it, it gets hard and doesn’t stick to my skin
Others staring at sugar wax:I should try that..I should remove my hair's Me:sugar wax is so tempting..I just want to eat that
your first recipe is not sticky at all.
went to waxing because i was frustrated with my sugar wax not turning out right. Came back to sugaring because i'd always been obsessed with it. Watched this whole video with my mouth wide open. Thank you so so sos o so much. you have no idea how excited i am to start sugaring again🥰
Throw some cream and Bam! Caramel
why B-Soda and lemon?
I can't stop watching these, I've sugar waxed before, but my wax always used to harden too much when cooled, now I know why. But I'd still like to know how you made your second undercooked wax, I wanna use wax strips and that one looked perfect for using waxing strips but you didn't really specify how you made it and if it stays that runny even when cold. Is there a video I missed that shows how you made it?

Guys I’m really bored here. Could someone debate me in the comment section? On literally any topic I’m so bored and I need to make some friends. Please?
How long will the sugar be preservable? And I also wonder if you should keep stirring when it starts to boil. I get different results when stirring or not. It gets more firm when I keep stirring. Maybe because the temperature will be the same in the whole pan?
The very first time when I attempted making sugar wax. it was _perfect_, the second time it was a little bit harder, but I still could use it. And since then whenever I try making sugarwax, it literally becomes as hard as a rock. Yesterday I turned the heat off when the mixture was barely a little bit yellowy, but after I poured it into a container and let it sit for a few hours to cool down, it became dark brown. So it looks like I have to buy a kitchen thermometer.
And which type cloth do you use
If you don't have a theometer how do you know if it's the right temperature?
Freak this I’m using syrup       Jokes ;-;
@abetweene hey! I bought sugar wax but its runny, like ur first stage. And I want it to be spreadable like ur second one, like runny but take out all hair using cotton strip. How to do that??
You’re great!
OMG!!! I tried it once and I way overcooked it, but this is the second time I tried making it and it came out just how I wanted it to!!! I learned so much from the first I made it to the second time! Thank you soo much for making these videos!!!!
1st buy thermometer and watch the video 😆
ok so I stayed within 110-116 celsius and it became rockhard like I can’t even get the spoon i used to mix it out of it once it completely cooled, what did I do wrong (I cooled it in an ice bath and stirred it to ensure the cooling was even and then kinda kneaded it with the spoon, was that the problem? I saw someone else do that to their wax)
Soooo which one do I use for a Brazilian wax? I’ve watched All of your waxing videos and I am so confused 😓.
does someone know if it's ok to store the wax right away into a yogurt-type container? (or sour cream container whatever you wanna call it)
My sugar wax is made for strips but it’s not sticking?
Thank you for all your time and effort that you put into your videos! Super easy to follow and you’ve helped me save my sensitive legs from razors! ❤️
Imma just eat it 😑. Bad sugar addiction
Is there a way you can make wax without using sugar
My sugar seems firm and won't stick to  my skin even with powder. Help??
I melted a bowl 🤓
love the pun in the beginning
Can I eat it .-.
💞💜, thank you for the recommendation
Ran across your videos looking for sugar wax information and ended up with a gold mine! You have such awesome content!!! Love how you break everything down - you are SO informative! Keep up the amazing work!
I think I just burnt mine :(
Hello there! just one question. How long can I store this sugar wax? Should I store the wax in the plastic container inside the fridge?  Thanks! :)
I don’t know if I want to wax with it or eat it
On this episode of things I tried from YouTube that didn’t work.....  Anyway, I cooked it to the deep color- and temp of around 250. It was soooo sticky. What did I do wrong ?
Do u sell ur sugar?
You guys could also microwave first microwave for 30 seconds then another 30 the 2 minutes
Do you have an Etsy shop?
I’ve depleted all my sugar. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Either the sugar is too hard and turns to taffy/ hard candy while im trying to knead or it sticks to my fingers so bad while kneading. I just don’t know where I’m going wrong
Does cold sugar wax that are sold  still the same ?
You really just need to start selling these sugar waxes online 😫 I WILL BUY
I honestly give up 😭 I microwaved it & I still FAILED
Mine turned out clear, and i don’t know why
This definitely helped me! I tried it before and I just quit and never retried 😟 but this definitely is very helpful 🤩😁
GUYS I JUST MADE A REALLY GOOD SWEET TAFFY BUT IT WONT STICK TO MY SKIN HELP
“Is thicker than a bowl of oatmeal” WE STAN A LEGEND   RIP Vine
Toooooooooo much information squeezeD into this video W/O the pertinent info that is needed. This video is all over the place!!!!! Not beginner friendly, therefore i still have to look up a simpler video
Loved this!!!
Could I microwave instead or no?
Cleaning the pot is so hardddddddd
don't know what I'm doing wrong,bt even after kneading it's either become solid or not sticky
Literally keep making this and it’s saving so much $$ thank you
Other girls:I need sugar,honey,water.....(making wax) Me: Let's get this from shop( very easily) 😁😁😁
Question if anyone can answer, I wanna try sugaring my bikini line and I was wondering doesn’t anyone know exactly how with a sugar wax?
But does it taste like caramel?
Instead of my using a warmer for the hard wax, can I mix the soft wax and hard wax to apply on the hair?
It works for me from ur first tutorial. But some batches still flop. And then u make this video. Like who even are you  Thank you so so so much.😗😗😗
this is helpful thanks!
Please can you make a video on application of sugar wax? also do you need to apply with a wax strip or can it be applied without a spatula and strips? Thanks
i tried your old method and the sugar re crystalized to a fine sugar so i ended up with a new lip exfoliator. :)
Mine is like a rock 😭😭
What do I do if when my sugar dries it always gets crystallized, I did everything you said to do but no matter what it will never work.....
Thanks for your video! So helpful :D It's humid in Japan, so I'll make the hardest one.
Can you sell the sugar you make?
Can someone please tell me does this pain
منو عنده الترجمة ياجماعه
Same here Everytime I make my sugar wax it's like gambling. Thanks. Great video.
Can I eat it?
I know this is a waxing video but I'm just going to make candy thanks for the help
It's okey for me when i keep on trying to make sugar wax because we have bakery shop and i don't mind using it hehehehe
I hope the right thing to do after realizing there was too much water in my batch is to heat it back up because that’s what I’m doing rn 😩
Can you use brown sugar?
Hey so I tried your method a couple of times and I’m always a little torn between cooking until the right temperature or the right color... because my paste never really turns out this amber color and more like actual honey - so much brighter.... I’m always afraid I’ll undercook it. And advised on how to fix this?
❤️
GREAT VIDEO. THANK YOU
I need to try this out.
IVE TRIED SO MANY TIME.... And i either over cook it or undercook it 😭😤
I successfully made sugar wax on first attempt by following your recipe. But on my second and third batch while kneading, it turned into hard candy. Even after warming it, when I was trying to use on dry powdered skin, the wax wouldn't stick. I don't know what I did wrong 🤔
Am I the only one who makes it and it gets super hard in the middle of kneading it and unappliable 😢😢
How I work with hard sugars is I pour it in batches depending on how much I made onto my granite counter and using metal spatulas I would fold and spread it until it cooled down enough for me to roll and stretch and cut it into little logs so it’s easier to work with when I use it
I thought she was rolling a blunt and I was like...did I press the wrong vid?
Do you eat it
I’m just painfully tweezing my face rn bc I’m sure imma mess this up
Can you just sell your caramels like cute little french candies? I will seriously buy them. DM me at @Bimbinha if you are willing to do this. XO
It gets hard
I have a wax warmer but I don’t know why the wax don’t get warm enough and runny enough to apply to my skin. Even when it looks like it’s getting too cold it still too hot. What am I doing wrong
I hate having to wax but its only my armpits so 🤧
Thank you for sharing this video
I dont have a thermometer 😔
Is it possible to fix undercooked wax??
another video needed
Tried sugaring yesterday and fucked it up because I used too much water when I was kneading it like you said lmao and already booked a waxing appointment.😹🤦🏽‍♀️
can you make it without lemon juice?
can you use this to remove blackheads and whiteheads?
hey, just to clarify, when it boils on med-high heat, you leave it there and wait to reach the desired temp? you don't decrease the temp after boiling first? I keep failing at this. I've wasted so much sugar already 😢
My sugar was really runny still?? What am I doing wrong??
What kind of Texture would think is best for Brazilian wax and under arm hair
Hello! I made my sugar but after watching this again I believe I need to cook it some more.Can I do that?
What if you don’t have a thermometer? Are there other ways to tell?
Bruhh i live in florida and i was wondering what i was doing wrong
Just buy a wax hair removal lol
Update: bros and sis from hot and humid weather places, you DEFINITELY should make the hard-ball wax because using a firm-ball wax won't last for too long before it melts back and you'll need a wax strip... trying to cool it with cool water to firm it back won't work that good because the humid weather will make the paste dilute with the water in your hands SO if you'll use a firm-ball wax instead of a hard-ball make sure you'll wax yourself in a room with air conditioner ✌
How do you wash these dishes???
For those of you who try this and fail, don't throw it away😂 I turned my failure into a sticky sweet chilli chicken wing sauce 😋
Can you simplify this as much as possible?! Maybe start out with the softball stage and do a video just on that because this video is too confusing and all over the place!
okay I did pretty okay but here are the 3 problems I ran into: 1) my first saucepan overflowed and got boiling sugar all over the stove 2) my meat thermometer only goes up to 220° so I just had to guess after that  3) it melted and warped my favorite plastic storage container when I poured it in
Informations in various cases
I'm scared it will be painful or wht
So helpful for making wax!!!! Thank you!
Where should we keep sugar if we want to save it? Can we keep it in refrigerator?
I've never tried sugar waxing until today after watching this video. It took me a couple times to get it to the right consistency but I was actually able to do it! I'll have to invest in a thermometer for sure. Is there a specific way to store the unused leftovers?
My skin tore in a few places while sugaring my arms. I have really dry arms and it only tore of the top few layers, it still kinda hurt though.
Thank you! I'm a newb, so still som trial and error - and my hairs are so stubborn! 😭 Some spots take 5-6 repetitions and the hair still won't pull out! But it's getting better the more I do it. I also have super light hairs on my knees that refuse to budge. Verrrry strange. 😣 But I'm not giving up!
Your videos are informative and very well recorded and edited. Nice work! I’d like to know if this is just as effective on the bikini area
can i just stick it in the fridge for an hour or so after i cook it to speed up the cooling process???
Beforeor it will boil, does the sugar have to dissolve first?
I made this recipe for the first time ever today. Never "successfully" attempted to wax before because ALL store bought wax strips were a whole no 😅. I got the wax perfect the first time and it wasn't too painful. Thank you soooo much for your tips 😊 Armpits like a smooth operator.
I don't know how to thank you enough. You are awesome 💕
I came across your channel yesterday as I had done the sugar wax mix and it was really runny and not effective. But after watching your videos I got it right and I’m actually waxing thank you so much I appreciate you have a wonderful day.!!!
U sound like you sing... do you? 🤨🥰
I'm using white sugar (cuz it's really cheap)  bit mine is still clear when it gets to 250 degrees and still pretty maleable like it's in between strip and soft ball not firm ball. Are you using turbinado sugar for yours to have that color and do the temperatures matter depending on the type of sugar?
did you leave it in fridge or out in the open?
I put a little too much water and lemon juice as i didn't have precise measuring tools. I stirred carefully and waited. It still worked but it got a little unwieldy. I waxed one arm to test. Very nice & smooth not too hard to rinse, unlike regular wax. I was too sticky to do the other arm but i will try again.  patience is important 💖
i definitely fucked up and made candy then tried to flush it down the toilet annnnd then burnt my finger
Omg her voice is so fire 🔥❤❤
I just did n when I start playing it with my hands it start melting 🤔😣. I usually do hot wax but sometimes it's a big mess specially in summer n rainy humid weather.
Okay so if I live in a hot climate I should make the hard wax, knead it, then store it in the fridge? Then take it out and use it at room temp?
Girl. 👏👏👏👏👏 God bless you. You're amazing.
Hey blessed morning so I’m on a weight loss journey I can’t afford gym membership or special diets I also am concerned about lose skin and sagging in some areas I try to lose 1.5-2 lbs a week I believe gradual weight loss is best, I’m in my mid 30s and have had 3 caesarian sections (terrible back pains) can you give general-tips on a method(s) to 1) keep weight loss simple and not too expensive 2)toning up while losing weigh and not look too bulky with muscle 3) can you provide maybe web sites or materials that may help myself and others to understand these things better thanks very much I found one video of yours it was the sugering video I immediately subscribe and binge watched you’re so knowledgeable you’ll make an excellent teacher if you’re not already one blessings from NY 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Way too much work. Just buy some off ebay
Uh and what if you don't have a thermometer?
I just saw this video and right away follow and liked I loved it!! Thank you so much for educating us on this!!
I wanna do this for swim team but uhhh I ain't about to ask my mum
Does anyone know? If you can achieve hair removal with the soft wax you can use straight out of the container why would anyone use the wax you have to heat?
Small note but when people say “Medium-High heat” I wish they would show us the flame height, it’s easier to go off of that
Can I use a lime
Every time I’ve tried to make the wax in the past I always think I have it right, but when I take it out and start trying to knead it... it gets hard and breaks like hard candy. Is this because I have over cooked it?
giiirrrrlll, looking out fi di cookout! th(ankh) you ~
Can you eat it?😂
I dragged mine and it became really dry and hard why?
Can we use lime juice???
I want to eat it
Because I don’t have a thermometer it took me 5 times to get the right temperature
GURL  I LOVE UR CHANEL !!!
This was confusing asf what do I do if I under cooked it, there was no solution, do I make a new batch. I’m even more lost with 1 quarter of my vag waxed 😓
Life saver.
how can i get it to work w vinegar??? it keeps turning hella hard
I tried to make the wax today. First was a fail (overcooked). I think the second batch worked. Not sure where to put for later use, some time tomorrow maybe. Would the refrigerator be fine?
Can I use it on my arms
Can u eat this
I literally burned myself and got 2 blisters on my hand from trying to make this sh*t earlier today. Now once I’ve told myself I’m not trying that sh*t again, this video pops up😭
Sooo... I just cooked me up some wax. I took it off the stove at 141f. Problem is, my sugar is still REALLY light in color. It darkened very slightly after cooling a little bit. It's still very hot and is cooling on a table next to me as I type this up. Have a feeling my first attempt isn't going to work lol. I might have to go based on color, the way you demonstrated in your first video, after all.
can you use the sugar a little while after you’ve made it? once it’s cool but still not completely stuck? like with the stick and a cloth
I  used vinegar.  I tried this for the first time it turned out good then when it was cooling i started eating it.
Well I don’t have a thermometer
My mixture reached the appropriate temp for firm but when I went to pour it in my container... I realized not all the sugar dissolved and settled to the bottom. I mixed it well before putting it on heat, so it should not have had time to settle. what did I do wrong?
How do you keep it from hardening when it cools?????
I burnt the SHIT out of my hand tryna kneed that hot wax😑😑😑
I think I’ve got it down, except it gets so sticky is sticky too my body?! And I don’t no how to deal with that? X
I’ve tried this countless times. And still can’t get it. I never got that “right” color. It’s always either too syrupy or rock hard. And I tried to get it to a firm ball at 250 degrees and then I got it off the stove as soon as the thermometer got to 250. But the color was like light yellow and very syrupy, and not like honey. When it dried it was too soft. Then I put it back on the stove for 2 more min to get it more like the honey color and then it got rock hard... 😣😣😣😣😣
I burned my skin 😞
Too much work
How do you get to that syrup/undercooked stage that removes all the hair ? What temperature would that be? Does it stay that liquid or did you have to heat it ? Thank you !
Can I ask about how you use the different waxes after you put it after you put it in the wax warmer. Example, do you use the harder wax for armpit hairs and the softer wax for leg hairs.
Oh  I thought this was for eating the sugar  Aight bye
which sugar wax works best on peach fuzz? I have a lot of peach fuzz on my face. I tried a gelatin face mask yesterday but it didn't work and just now I tried a sugar wax (recipe from a different video) but it didn't remove it either. ☹ I have questions about this video, too. is it really ok if the sugar hasn't caramelised after it reached the desired temperature? and can I use the waxes cold or what is the best recommended temperature? I also tried my wax on my arms but I feel like my hair just doesn't want to stick to it...
It's always too hard or too sticky
which stage is best?!?!?
Ugh!  Mine is undercooked!  Can I just put it back on the stove and cook it more?  Also, did I hear you correctly that if you had a big enough pan that it wouldn't boil over it wasn't necessary to keep stirring ?  I thought I was keeping it from burning.  I know this isn't a new video but if anyone is here and knows the answers I'd love to hear from you.  Great videos abetweene!
Yes please make a full video!
How cool should it be before i put it in a glass container?
Just like a slime Hahahaha!!!!!
Why do you knead the sugar? Is it something you have to do?
Can I use flower for the powder
What temperture was the undercooked wax strip one
Just made my first batch and used on my face. Worked so well the first few seconds then be it became so soft. I didn't have any wax sticks on hand so I couldn't do more. I'll be more prepared next time!
is it possible to use the double boiler method to make sugar wax?
thank you for the information, I made my first "Sugar Wax" and it came out very nice ❤👍
*Soft ball FIRM BALL hard ball* ☻
Tu voz es bonita y relajante
I'll just buy some caramel
How many minutes does it take to get to all the 'ball stages' ? I don't have a thermometer
Do you pour the sugar wax directly from the pan to the conatiners?
Very informative. I love it.
I dont understand can you eat it?
does vinegar work instead of lemon
Thank you so much!!!
Even when I follow the temperatures, my sugar doesn’t turn that colour
I shouldn't watch this while hungry
I am not good at this...I made a mess 😭😭😂
What if u don’t have a candy thermometer?
Damn girl I thought it couldn't get any better but you took this to another level. Great video, again
I showed this to my mom and saved atleast $50-$90 so thank you!
When the sugar wax was in the paper it looked like eclairs
So if I put it in the warmer do I have to use strips? Or does it turn into hard wax that I can rip off
Use coffee filters instead of buying cloth strips. Cheaper
How did I only discover your channel now? The quality and time that goes into your videos is phenomenal. Thank you for doing what you do. Keep it up, you’ll build it into an empire no doubt 💰
mines under cooked. How long do you recommend putting it in the microwave?
So I got a thermometer and I took the sugar off the stove top when it reached 245, but then the temperature kept rising for a few seconds and got all the way up to like 270? Is there a trick to getting it off at the right time?
Tried it , looked like it was going okay but it hardened like a rock when it cooled down 😭
After making the sugar wax, how long will it keep for? Also, does it need to be stored in the fridge?
When you use your hard wax in the pot, what setting or temperature do you set your wax warmer on? Thanks for the quality information ❤️
I wish I didn’t burn the shit out of my fingers trying to knead before  I saw this
I must be a fool because this foolproof recipe is not working for me at all - my sugar mix at 116degC is still totally transparent and I'm so confused.. Its also 35degC in the UK right now and the cooled down mix is rock hard at room temperature.. This is so frustrating I'm even ashamed to say I'm not a complete sugaring novice but it's still hit and miss the majority of the time 😩😩  The mix that was made is pliable (which gets hard when kneaded? I'm confused too) but it wont stick to my hair/skin - I've exfoliated for 2 days prior and powered my skin - I've failed a number of times but haven't ever had my sugar turn into something like this.. help please??
Great videos !! Love the sharing ones but I I found this one kinda confusing
Can u use apple cider vinegar, or just regular vinegar?
I tried making some, but as soon as it got to temperature, the color was not dark at all. I added it back to heat some more. It darkened a bit. Will it set up as it cools? Or should I be doing something different?
Hi! Great video. I really have learned a lot about sugar waxing. I made 4 small batches. The first 3 came out perfect & I used them & they worked fine. The forth batch, I used lemon instead of lime & cooked it a little longer & it reached a higher temp. Other than that no difference.  I’m an esthetician & took & the batches to work to practice on the staff. The forth batch would not still to the skin at all. What do u think went wrong there? Thanks for your help!
Mine was undercooked like you said, so what do I do? Do I have to throw this one away??
Okay so I just made 3 different samples of wax. 1 too hard, 2 medium and 3 is soft-but problem is that it's too hot to put on and wen u wait a second it becomes solid in matter of seconds 😑idk what to do?! It's burning hot 1 sec and it's solid the next 🙄
I want to make the soft ball sugar but how can I know what temperature am I boiling it at? (I use a cooker, and it may sound stupid but there's no way of knowing). I did this a couple of times int he past but the sugar would turn hard very fast and couldn't use it. It was a mess
i tried it but i’m too dumb for this lmao .. the pan got messed up, i burnt myself, and i got my ass beat 🤠
This was seriously SOOO helpful!! Thank you for the detailed descriptions!!🙏
Thank you so much for this new video! I tried several times to make this and I always had to throw out the batch because I ended up with a gooey mess stringing  between my hands while trying to knead it. The heat and humidity where I live makes it very hard to knead it. This last time, I kept thinking “what candy stage does she cook it to?” Now my question has been answered! I will attempt this again tomorrow.
I'd really love to know how to make the undercooked wax at 5:30, I feel more comfortable working with strips so I really want to achieve that one
What about the ones like me who tried it and not one single hair came off? What am i doing wrong
Just made my first attempt..... Got it too hot and too hard. I left a the glass dish and two forks covered in the hardened stuff sitting in a dish of water to dissolve..... My boyfriend is going to be so confused the next time he goes to the kitchen. Hahaha
You deserve every single follower you’ve got. Your channel is fantastic!!!!
I tried to make this but I fail, the "wax" get too liquid and it didn't stick to the skin and it didn't took any hair at all in other words it was a hot mess to my legs and to my skin
what type of container should i use is glass safe won't it shatter and plastic wil melt?
can you make it without lemon juice or can it be substituted with other things?
Soooo, can I just go buy some soft Carmel candy and rub it on my face?
I don't understand what I did wrong.. I boiled it on medium heat until it was 235°F and it's such a light colour, almost clear?
is it right that 2 cups are 424 gramm and 0,25 cups are 29 ml?
I was able to make a sugar wax and I was able to get it to work applying it to strips. However, even with powder, or water on my fingers or no water on my fingers I was not able to knead it or apply it directly to my skin to pull off. It just kinda smooshed and got sticky and was a mess. Did I use too much water?
How does the pate not stick to ur hands, I once used store bought sugaring paste and it was soo sticky and weird
Thank you so much! You are amazing!
my therm says 248 but my sugar is so light I usually cook to color
I cooked mine until softball stage and it cooled rock hard 😞can’t put it on I followed directions exactly??
Can you store this in a glass container? Done have anything plastic. Also if so, how do I keep the glass from shattering, since you can't let the wax cool before pouring it?
Can I use it for each body part? Thanks for being awesome xD
why does it smell so horrible tho
Mine looks really burnt it’s like almost black is that ok ?
Can you put the cooked liquid in the container you were using as soon as you take it off the oven? If not how long do you wait?
I tried it and I put it in a jar for 3 minutes to cool and it became rock solid
Best sugar wax video ever. THANK YOU!
Once you called it candy I had an intense urge to eat it
It hurt so bad
👍nice video sister please sub back
I tried the microwave method I did 3 min as you said and it was overcooked😢
My wax gets super hard very fast when i start needeing it. And i can't use it :( how come?
How do you fix it when it’s undercooked
I totally made some under cooked wax and still used it with some cloth. It soaked through but still worked. I’ll be trying this again today. 🙏🏾
Hi, I prefer to use strips but haven't found anything about temperature in any of your videos. What temperature would you recommend for strip wax? Can I use it cold or does it have to be warmed? How long can I store if for? Also, what strips are better, non woven or muslin? Thank you very much 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I want to make your sugar wax but just to use with strips. Any of these will work with strips?
I buy mine saves me more
Ok soooo i tried doing the soft wax and took it out at the same temp but why does it look under cook like it’s still transparent???
Best video EVER about sugaring! Thank you 😉✌🏼
you're giving me too many options idk what im suppose to do
very clear and informative, thank you!
I am wondering, is there a reason why my sugar does not get the fine hairs? It works on thicker hair, but the fine ones do not get out. I bought my paste, is not diy and I don't know what I'm doing wrong😔
Can i use lime juice instead?
Could i eat this🤣🤣
can you write the correct gram for the shugarpaste of whater, shugar and citrus?
Do you store in the fridge or at room temperature?
my wax is too sticky 😔
👍
Does anyone else feel like eating it
What's the measurements in grams? Sorry I have tried to look but it's so complicated!!!
This wonderful woman has changed my whole life for better with her only one video 😌❤️
This was literally answering all the questions i had! Mine was undercooked but i didn’t know that and i was so confused and then i used too much water because it was sticking to my hands. You’re awesome thanks!
I was so desperate i tried to use a melted butterscotch,  where were you then🤨
Is there a way I can make a cold version and not a lot I just need it for my nose
Does this work on any type of hair that isn't peach fuzz?
I love ur videos they’re so informative ! But unfortunately i can’t do it right and i’m not really sure why, every time i boil it it looks good etc but i can’t knead it because it’s too hot and then when i finely can it goes this pale yellow colour and then doesn’t stick to my skin. Any tips on how to fix this ?
Can we eat it ????
I made it and put it in a container and whenever I need to use it, I put it in the microwave. It works perfectly!
I tried it but it didn't work for me but it did work for my mom😭😭
My fatass wanna eat it 😩
Yassssss thank you!!!
Omg,😫 I just finished sugaring my face (it took me 5 1/2 hrs) because I suffer from PCOS and let me just say I wanted to hit myself after I saw the results!😍 so if you're talking yourself out of doing it because of the pain DON'T...suck it up buttercup😘
Can I use lime juice instead of lemon?
can i sub lemon juice with lime juice?
It’s Carmel    Not caramel.
This did NOT work for me. I followed the directions exactly and it didn't even pull out any hair, it hurt VERY bad and made lots of little bruises on my leg. I'm not very happy with this (and all the bruises on my leg) 😡
Thank you so much for this video! using the thermometer definitely helps, I definitely heated up to between 235 Fahrenheit and 240 Fahrenheit. It's now cooling off fingers crossed! 😁
At 240 the wax is actually white..
And thats how you make no glue slime
*thicker than a bowl of oatmeal*  i instantly subscribed
Title should be No need to knead.
1:02-1:05 sounds wrong if talked about out of context.
I tried it and it was messy
Does it get stuck to the pan
Can somebody be kind enough to summup what she said on this video compared to the other one? English is not my first langage ...
Can you eat it
P
I get lazy doing this 😂 I've done it four times and the results are amazing but it just takes me too much to finish doing all my arms and legs, I'm really hairy ㅜㅜ) I wish I had someone to help 😂
Every Arabic person will feel like this is so out of it's time.
i want to _eat it_
So u like firm balls?
I'm afraid I might have undercooked mine. When I poured it into the container it seemed really liquidy. Wondering if that will go away once it cools?
Which sugar do you recommend, white or black sugar?
I don't have a thermometer, so after the mixture starts to boil, how many minutes should I let it cook?
I usually make the firm wax and I always heat it to the right temperature, but it never comes out as orange as yours does. Am I doing something wrong?
I don't have a thermometer so how do I know when to stop cooking?
I just shave
I accidentally cooked mine to that very dark color that’s thicker than a bowl a oatmeal 😭😭 What do I do now?!
Omg thank you for this! I bruised the crap out of my leg because my sugar was too sticky!!
Thank you so much for clarifying how to make the sugar! I have tried to make sugar wax so many times, and I have failed almost as many times as I have tried! This video has helped me understand how I might be able to finally get the wax making process right!
What am i dong wrong
Why
When i want to knead it the suger hardens
My thermometer only goes to 220°F, but to make a long story short it melted my plastic container into the countertop, severely burned my fingers and tore up my floor. I can't even get this mess up with hot soapy water.
I don't have a thermometer and was tryna make a medium wax, but I think I burned the mixture
I tried this and all I did was burn my skin and it didnt even pull anything out
Lol if I wax with candy will I become a sweeter person?
I legit just watched the other video and i tried it. I got it on the second try however i didnt wait till it gets brown, i waited till it was about golden and i let it cool and then i used it and it worked beautiful
THANKYOU !!! 💙  I really needed this detailed video.
I waxed my upper lip, and I treated it like you said in your videos and now when I touch the left area its sore! Can you help? I've tighten my skin as you said and followed everything❤
Wow this changed my life! Love the videos, so finely done. Thank you for this life hack!
When I cook the white sugar to 240°F it is still very light gold (like it is undercook) and does not have the same color as the sugar on your video. What am I doing wrong ? (I live 300m above sea level so it should not affect the boiling temperature)
This is unbelievably informative!!!! I just made sugar wax and my chin burns, not from the heat but from ripping it off!!! Then I found ur videos and I’m going to try the harder version and kneed it so I don’t have to use wax strips. Anywho, this video is great!! ❤️✨😘
5:25 can you tell me how u get that consistency?? How much sugar lemon and water u used n for how much time u boiled it on medium flame??
how long can you save the wax for?
can somebody please simplify this for me because im stupid 😂😂
I don’t have a thermometer!😩 I’ve tried many times before and failed. How am i supposed to make this now!😭😭
My sugar wax doesn't stick
Why the short videos? I still can’t get it right. Please do a detailed video 😫
Why is the lemon juice important?
First I was a cautioner then I was a over, over achiever and I also burned myself 😭😭and I have now came across this video 😫
I'm sorry I'm here after watching your previous video buttttt I just can't understand anything in this video... Please just more simpler
if you want it to be the"to soft" version that is good with cloth strips, what temp do you cook it to?
I did everying how you said it but when my sugar cools down it goes back to its crisstal form.... how can i prevent this from happening?
Thank you soo much 😭 this is the best. what is your favorite temperature to cook your wax at?
YOOOoo I know for sure you can do a video on waxing the vag. I think you would execute this love. Come through cuz I want to do it myself but Im scared.
now my wax is not sticking to my skin omg
it finally worked for me! but for some reason my wax is a very pale color, nothing like yours. It might be the products I used ? not sure.  if you could do a video on bruising, like on how to prevent it and how to heal them, i would really appreciate that (kinda have an ugly bruise on my arms).   tysm for ur content , i appreciate everything you do ❤️
Did you set them in room temperature or in the fridge?
Is it just me or does your sugar go hard and brittle when you need it
so even if its overcooked you can try to knead it and come back later so that its pliable? i tried to make your microwave sugar wax mine came out hard as candy and i was able to knead it but i wasnt able to apply it to my skin
Where did you buy the wax warmer?
can i use an old pillow case as a cloth strip ?
I wanna prepare soft sugar wax but I dont have the temperature machine. What do I do? Plz help
Time stamp for soft wax 0:53-3:07! Great video Gurrrrrrl☺ THANKS!
I dont get good results with a sugar ball only with strips, I feel the sugar doesnt remove hair but if i cook it less its too sticky 😫
On different occasions I have attempted to make this wax and I’ve either almost succeeded or failed at it every time , so what am I doing wronnnnngggggg????🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
You should made your own sugar wax company
I tried the recipe many many times but always failed to get the desired result
🤯🤯 wow I came across your channel and I'm hooked!
Can you please do the  cups in ml and grams🤷🏼‍♀️
How do I keep it from getting too sticky on my skin? I've cooked it to both the firm and hard ball stage and it still is too sticky. :( I'm following the directions exactly too.
someone guide me 😩 i followed the first video not this one since i have no thermometer, and now watching this one, looks like the one i made is hard wax, but everytime i would apply to my skin it just wouldnt stick or spread, and i did put baby powder to take away moisture..tried kneading but it wasn’t softening.
you are soo thorough! amazing video
Mine got hard. I ate it 😭
Why does it keep sticking to my hands????
‘Do you wanna try sugar waxing but you just wanna pull your hair out?’  Meanwhile in my head: ‘well that’s what I wanna use sugar wax for isn’t it???’
I need help😩I tried to make it but when I reach the desired temperature the color is not dark or amber color. Why is this happening? I’m I cooking it too fast?
ok but that sounds so painful but also id eat that
Ok weird question but can I do it in the microwave 😂
It works! This recipe also just helped me save a bee that came into my window and got drunk off of my essential oil diffuser so thank you 😂
Video Suggestion: how to sugar wax your own legs efficiently  Sincerely,  All of us who are walking around with smooth shins and hairy calves 😂
soo i have a problem. i'm absolutely new to this whole sugar waxing. I made my own sugar Paste, used have of it one day after I made it and stored the rest for like a week or more. but the problem was the same on both times I used it: I think I made something in between a soft and firm ball. I still kneeded it because I felt like it was still to hard to apply. but I didn't kneed it until it was as opaque as in 2:50 like.. not at all. also I kneeded it with wet fingers each time. then, when I actually usef and applied it, it worked for like 5 times of applying and pulling. after that few times it stardet to get really sticky and stuck to my fingers so I used more water on my fingers to get it not as sticky. But then it wasn't as applyable on my skin as it should be. long story short I ended up having pretty much the same problem as at 5:45 . so what was my mistake? should I kneed it until it's way more opaque as in 2:50 or did I just use to much water? Also I wanna mention that english is not my mother tongue so I can't always follow the instructions and tips on the video ^^' any help woulf be really kind :)
Good  chakolet
I cooked it to 240 and let it sit for 2 hours to cool, but when I try to use it as a strip wax. The sugar seems to be undercooked, is there a way for fix this issue without overcoming the sugar? Should I let it solidify completely and knee it?
This is very informative! Thank you for your hard work, I tried sugaring at a salon and I was left with bruises in my underarm Area because the I guess the sugar melted in my skin and it’s wasn’t coming off so the girl kept pulling,I want to try it again because I do feel like it was way better than regular wax, so this helps a lot!
I tried and failed 4 times before trying this video and got it on first go🙌 thankyou!!
Can I use lime juice instead?
Oh wait i can just eat it
I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL!
Thank you for this video!!
Did you pour the sugar in the container while hot or did you take it off the range, wait, then pout?
Help!! I've literally tried 9 times and keep failing. The first batch was too soft second too hard now they all seem to be undercooked when cooking them to the correct temperatures. I've even tried 260°F and still too soft. Should I did more sugar? I'm following what you are doing. Idk 😫😣
do you ever store the wax in the fridge? or can i just put it in a plastic container and set it to the side until im ready to use it?
I tried this before but I stored it in a plastic tub and that was a hugeeee mistake. I watched a different video and she said to put honey and all these other random things into it and I tried it just like she said to and it was liquid.. I even left it out over night and it was liquid. Love this video!
I tried this and it really does work! however, I think I used 1 cup of sugar with 1/4 lemon and 1/4 water. Cooked it to 250 degrees and then poured it into a container and left it to sit for like 6 hours ( I didn't want to wax until the next day anyway)  However, doing the waxing by hand didn't work worth a flip for me... it stuck EVERYWHERE!  So I used a butter knife for a while... it did okay, but still stuck to my leg some and because of that I had to do it with little bitty globs of sugar wax at a time.... so it took forever, I never even finished the lower half of my leg that way!  So I moved to using an old, thin towel as a waxing strip... let me tell you it works amazing!  Because the strips allow you to do a bigger area at a time( even tho that does hurt a little worse) I was able to actually finish my leg!  My leg gets red and slightly swollen just after waxing, however, a few hours later my leg is smooth and soft as silk! Softer than it ever got shaving! I will add that the sugar wax does leave behind some hairs here and there that I just couldn't get it to pull out... so I did end up shaving off the stragglers.  But Now that I know how to do it better I can try again with the stragglers next time!
If i can’t knead it does that mean i cooked it too long?
After I knead, I always end up with a hard piece of light yellow sugar candy that cannot be spread or moulded. What am I doing wrong?
my wax immediately turns into a glass like consistency after i try kneading it.. What do I do
What is the temp on the last wax that you can just apply and wax?
How long should the hair be before you sugar it? Should you trim it if it's too long?
So are you supposed to warm the sugar up before you use it, or just apply it when it's room temperature?
Wow I juste tried this recipe for the wax and it turn out really well. I can use the wax with strip or without strip.  You need to make sure when you put in the microwave the sugar and lemon should not boil too much. I did each round for 20seconds and made sure the color was golden. Anyway a big thank you
0:13 😀😀😀story of every woman when she tried to make wax for the first time
The sugar that was undercooked but useable as a strip wax - what temp was that cooked to? I can’t seem to get that right!
Omg what does it mean if it gets too hard?? Did I cook it too long or not enough?? I was trying to make a soft ball but my thermometer doesn’t go up to 240.
How much is one cup in grams? because everytime I look it up on the internet there are different answers and they also differ between flour and sugar...
Foolproof huh..
What if I don't have a thermometer???
them: “FOOLPROOF”  me: hahahahah bet
Please respond. Can you use flour instead of arrowroot  powder?
could you use this on your lady bits??
Do you have to use lemon?
My sugar cristalized 😭 I tried many many times! don't know how to do it!
This has helped a ton!!! I use a specific sugar so it's not white and I can't go by color and I've basically been guessing lol
Every time I make sugar it's always a hit or miss and it's so frustrating
Can we keep them in those little package and eat them as candies ? 😂😍
I have been trying and trying. It never works for me. Everytime after I knead it, it turns to a solid hard candy. Like if I took a hammer to it, it would shatter. Any idea what I am doing wrong? I swear I take it off the second it starts to golden.
I tried the no knead method, I boil it until a yellow soft golden, definitely not over boiled or burnt.... pour it when it starts to cool down, and it becomes ROCK SOLID. So when I want to use it, I have to reheat it to knead it, but when I do it becomes rock solid again u.u  It appears to be the perfect paste but no matter how much you knead either cold or warm, it never "pastes" it keeps in a stretchy solid caramel state. I don't have a microwave so I have to reheat in a water base. I don't think the "pour and store" method works....   I'm feeling super frustrated because I love sugaring but it only worked 2 or 3 times out of almost 10 attempts.
Can you use brown sugar
very helpful
Gave up on sugaring because I burned my fingers so many times while trying to knead. It's impossible to do so.
Can we apply this to remove facial hair.
Fuck.. Can I just cook it simply?  We dont have a thermometer. I give up.  I always end up cooking a candy! I'm just gonna buy a wax from Watsons. Save more time and patience.
So which one are we supposed to make???
❤️
The one that i did solidified when it cools down and when i try to knead it, it wont work. Does it still have a chance?
I would probably end up eating it before using it for actual waxing.
How do I make the second undercooked batch. I'm comfortable with using the paper strip thingy. Not free handing it.
Can I fix undercooked sugar like put it back in the pan or something?
What if you don't have a thermometer? How can I still make it???
My first attempt at making this came out super thick version of 'undercooked'. Worked great at removing my hair, I just had to use cotton pads as strips to wax it off. I tried making a larger batch, and I used a non-bone char granulated turbinado sugar instead of the stark white granulated sugar that would give you that nice clear white to start, so when the color hit, I could only guess to assume I was good (I filmed it for a follow-up video for a first time home sugaring using your recipe and guidance! To be posted on Turning Strawberry, soon). As a kid, I used to make hard rock candy, and a tip for those that do not have a thermometer is to get a measuring cup of water and test your ball by drip testing it into the water. You get a pretty solid look at the stages (soft ball, hard ball, etc.) when the syrup hits the water, because the drop of sugar will cool immediately into whatever stage it's cooked to, before slowly dissolving as it sits on the bottom.
Confusing af
Thank you for all of this great info! How do you make cold strip sugar for brows or very small places
Thank you for sharing.
hmm.. tried doing it with a thermometer for the first time, boiled to 240F/116C, but it is not at old golden, more like very light yellow, like honey in water... should I keep boiling or how should I handle this? Thanks for help :S
THANK YOU!!!!!
So if I would like to use sugar wax with strips I need to make the soft wax and heat it enough to make it thin and spreadable?
Why is mine turning hard like candy!!!!!!!
I tried it and I loved it but I have one question. When I warm it up in a wax warmer and i spread the sugar wax over my legs. It is very thick. How can I make sure I can make a thin layer. Is it the temperature or the recipe?
Is the 240° cold wax just sugar or sugar water and lemon?
Great vid, thank you for sharing.
Ok ,I failed twice because I dipped my hand into water too many times, it became worse and worse, so just washed my hands and gave up on doing it again.
I burnt my tongue lmaooo
Very informative
*Can I eat it ?*
Hi, can you tell me the temperature of the wax you showed at 5:23? Is that the firm ball stage? Pls reply
well turns out it's not foolproof enough for imbeciles like me ✌️ edit: rewatching the end I definitely undercooked and afterwards used too much water while kneading. the weird thing is, my temperature was up really really quickly, before the colour changed completely? do you cook it at lower temperatures or what?
I used the first video to do this and I did it perfectly. I burned two of my fingers but that was because I wasn’t paying attention. It was a bit harder than soft ball so I think it was firm ball.
Ima just eat it!
I first started waxing and I got a few bumps 😔😪😭 any way to get rid of them?
Is the difference between the three of them just how long u let them sit ? I’m so confused
Can you do it without lemon juice
so is it 2 cups of sugar to 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of water?
Could you make a video about strip wax... the best method, kinds of material you should use .. basically the does and don’ts for home strip waxing 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Need a 2nd video please
What was the temperature of the second undercooked version? That looks easier to work with than the paste types.
I tried it 4 times.When I cool it becomes crystally.What can I do??  Any one's guide??
So I tried this for the second time today. I'm having trouble. First of all, it doesn't seem to be doing a thorough job at all and I keep having to go over the same places repeatedly (sometimes to no avail).  Second, I'm getting red bumps raising up on my skin afterward. Is this normal? What am I doing wrong?
Heyy.... How is your paste so clear ? Do u use fine sugar? Ive tried 5 times now .... Failed every single time ..... The paste has granules of sugar which make it very hard to knead then eventually hard for use or anything at all! HELP ME PLEASE
Okay, so I'm struggling hardcore here guys. I've lost count with the amount of failed attempts I've had with trying to make some. Everything goes swell until I get to kneading part and it the mixture just goes hard on me while attempting to knead it. Heeeelp
I tried sugaring today and I feel like it’s way less painful than any other waxing method
How do I go straight to a thin wax to use with strips? I've never done it and flicking it seems intimidating. I want to use strips but don't know how long to cook it for or how to let it cool down without getting too hard.
Can I use this on my face? Or do I need other type of sugar wax?
It's so hard to do damn
Honey. IDK what just happened but I'm subscribed now.
HELP!! I tried to make the hard wax because it's hot where I am, but it didn't work. It would only rip out like one hair at a time and go hard after the second attempt. What am I doing wrong? Should I try to make the soft or firm instead?
i burnt my thumb oops
Sugar keeps cooking even after pot is taken off the heated stove. Once the sugaring paste/wax has reached the desired temperature, would it be wrong to stick the whole pot into a cold bath as in to shock it so it would stop cooking? Thanks for the tutorial :D!
First time here just looking for the recipe off a google search and I’m already liking and subbing which I don’t do often. Idek what the channel is about lol.  I love your voice, pace, editing and explanations. This vid is informative and I love that you say and show everything while being concise. This is just a great video for someone looking for informative content. I’m a digital media operator so these things just stand out to me lol. Anyway, thanks for the vid!
Woah i just tried the older method and LOWKEY messed up and now this W O A H
I had Light skin hard candy everywhere 😂😂
There’s me thinking it’s a recipe for candy 😂
I cooked mine to 120°c but it is soo undercooked
Am I the only one that want to eat it?   No, just me ok...
This video was suggested to me today and I just subscribed!! Great content!
I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I tried cooking to color then bought a thermometer and cooked to temp. I got to 250 and it's hard as a brick. Used a deeper pan so it would cook slower and pulled it off at 241 and it's barely golden.
Can I wax my mustache off with this?
Could I do this without lemon juice? Or what could be a substitute?          ...I just realized I need to change my pfp lmao
I failed doing this many times!
Omg literally just made this and it is the best wax and I HAD TO SHARE you guys medium heat add the ingredients she had and add a teaspoon of salt use a thermometer make sure it doesnt go over 235~40 take it off the heat if it des until it reaches a nice light amber/goldish color and cut up an old cotton t shirt for strips when it cools it should be like a thick honey
I was thinking that it could also be called slime
Can you make this with powdered sugar?
Hey, I tried this out and actually got the right consistency and everything but when I try to use it it only works for one flick before it's a sticky mess. Any advice? These videos are super helpful btw <3
*Going to try it this weekend!!* The FAQ video I think you said how you liked using turbinado sugar the most? I'm thinking of making it soft ball like you say in this video, with the pour and store. Will turbinado sugar be good for this?  I'm such a noob I hope it works out! Your videos are fantastic, keep up the great work ❤
So I made my own wax. HOWEVER before I watched the q+a video on sugar waxing I didn't know that it has to be granulated sugar. I made my sugar with organic nonbleached sugar and it still worked, however it took a while to make into a paste and I cooked it for about 5 minutes straight. Also it only works with hair that's about at least 1 cm long. It worked like a charm for me just make sure you have the proper sugar!
i keep failing !!!! 🤣 my sugar is STRINGY , HARDDDD and not sticking to my skin ! i haven’t shaved bc i wanna do this but i’m stressing lol
Thank you sooo so so much 💕💕💕
Can I use it like normal wax? Like apply it and use strips
Did this sugar wax remove hairs from pubic parts
If you made you're firm sugar how do you store it. Do you put it in the fridge or just keep it at roomtemprature?
Thanks for sharing! Unfortunately I am wayyyy too lazy for this. You should start an Etsy (unless I missed something and you already do) and sell this stuff! I’d totally buy it!
thank you sooooo much for this video!!!!!! it really helped me out
honestly it's really informative video. you explain it very well. i want to try. but i don't have a thermometer. i'll buy and try it asap. thank you girl!
Your a OK.... no... Good...     no..... Great..... no..... OUTSTANDING TEACHER
I've been attempting to make sugar wax for like a week and like 10+ failed concoctions! My first two I was actually able to at least rip some hair out but it was TURBO sticky and then would harden to a rock after like 20 minutes After that, I adjusted recipes with less sugar and whatnot and almost got it but I guess I overcooked it because it wouldn't stick and went hard as a rock when I kneaded it.... I'm still going to try because even after buying two bags of sugar and a candy thermometer it's still wayyyyy less expensive than getting it done professionally.. and I am ALL about DYI!!! Wish me luck !
I don’t have a thermometer can you tell me how long it takes to get to the right temperature
hey, what if I dont have a thermometer?
What are the conversions for the measurements
Thank you..thank you..thank you!! I've tried it just now... At first the sugar doesn't turn brown.. but after the bubbles,I turn off the heat...and let it cold a little bit.. I put on my leg.. then I use 'dry' wet tissue as the strip... And then I pull it out.. my God! No pain at all!! And my hair do came out! I'm so happy!
Interesting! I want to know what temperature of sugar wax if i want non knead or the undercooked but dark color? I need spreadable sugar wax consistency.
Mine was under cooked and it wasnt thicc or golden 😂😂
does the lemon juice have to be from a fresh lemon?
I wanna eat it
Was looking for a thermometer in my house and finally found it
I have tried to make sugar wax two times. The first got undercooked, the second over cooked ☹️
"Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal" Porridge shouldn't be too thick!
I just peeled a lemon !!!!!!!  #quadgoals  I had to tell someone 🙃
When the sugar was ready, I put it in a plastic container, it spilled all over the place ( the plastic containers melted) guess who burned her hands. I want to add that the sugar got hard on the table and i don’t now how to take it off. OH AND I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT I DID IT AT 4 am 🤠🤠🤠
i dont really get it so is it all the same wax, same results, but soft you can use while cold, firm you can also, and hard u have to warm it?
Lol The first time I made this it worked like a charm!!! But then the next 6 times I tried it it didn’t work AT ALL and just wasted loads of sugar so I think I just need a thermometer. My stove is annoying because it’s an old electric one so it’s temperamental 😂
So what temperature should i bring my wax to if i wanna use the cloth strips?
I cooked mine to 255 and it turned out runnier and lighter in color than the one you cooked at 240. In fact I haven’t been able to achieve a dark color at all. Should I just cook it to a higher temperature??
Can you use sugar waxing cold?
I have been wanting to get rid of my facial peach fuzz for ages! The couple times I tried sugar waxing have been nothing short of shameful. Your way worked perfectly on the first time. Thank you so much for this.
So what's the best temperature?
This video is so aesthetic & the best tutorial I've seen
How do you wax your arms without bruising yourself
Wait I thought you couldn’t eat it...
My brows and forehead needed this 😭 you make the BEST sugaring videos !!
So do you sell your sugar for sugaring? I would like make it but I prefer to buy it already made 😁
Does it work with brown sugar too?
So, which of the first 2 batches was the best?  I'm not sure if I should heat to 240F ... or  250F
I made some... and instead of becoming a sugar wax.... voaalaaa~ it's sugar hard candy, hard as lollipop 😭
I am trying and made the paste for the first time. But idk what I did wrong that the paste just doesn’t stick to my hairs. I rub it over and over the hairs and the sugar wax doesn’t stick to them :( can someone tell me where I  went wrong???!
Can u use it to wax my head & face?
Hi I just wanted to say thank for all the help your tips really helped when I made the sugar a second time!
Uhm... Am I not supposed to stir after it starts boiling?? Cause mine is golden and all, but gritty, and not transparent at all...
undercooking seems the best method
When I first tried to make sugar wax I used way to much water and it definitely didn’t work, but I couldn’t figure it out until I watched this video. Def gonna try again knowing what I know now from this video
is there a way to do this without a thermometer?
can you eat it?
You are amazing, I've been trying to get temp info since I started trying to do this.
I’ve tried this so many times, but every time my wax is cool enough to touch, it gets too firm to stick to my skin or pull any hair out, it just rolls like it’s over Cooked, even though I remove it AS SOON AS IT STARTS TO GOLDEN (sometimes even before that!) what do I do?!?!
Hi! I heated up my sugar to 250 degrees F, but I don’t get the same color. Is this normal?
question, at what firmness should you cook for bikini waxing?
Hey so I tried making the sugar wax, mine is still runny even after a day to cool so it’s more of a strip wax. Is there anything I can do to make it harder so I can have it in my hand, like a hard wax?
Very fast video
I have a serious question. So the “hard wax” in this video can be used in place of the same hard wax that’s used in waxing salons? Meaning that I can warm this hard wax in a wax warmer and spread it on my sensitive areas and rip it away once it’s solidified enough without using cloth strips just like they do at waxing places? ... I’m just trying to save money and not hurt myself lol
Help! Cooked to 240. Color looks golden. Kneaded while warm until color went lighter and seemed opaque. Feels sticky, but does not pull out hair When it cools completely it's rock hard. Ideas?
Have you tried it with xanthan
How about a pre and post wax care routine
How long do you cook the soft wax? I really can't see the color when it's boiling.
I liked because you said thicker than a bowl of oatmeal and I love you
Omg so excited  so as I'm writing  this I just finished waxing one leg using ur video I'm so excited  and happy with worked I was able to finish my whole leg with any other wax I can't it hurts was to much that you so so much for making this video  and your others
You are so helpful making these videos. But I am presuming there is no solution to saving an undercooked wet mixture?
Hi my name is Sophia and Im 13 year old and get really bad razor burn on my legs so  I looked into sugaring and I found you videos and I wanted to say they are so cool !  but I had a question and that was and  how can do you know when it is cooled because  I keep burning myself when I stretch it and need it or put it on my legs?
I binged your waxing videos, and watched and rewatched them. Last night I had all of the supplies, and I attempted the recipe... And it worked!!! I've never waxed before in my life, and I have some super sensitive skin, but your guidance and knowledge was incredible and critical in my not hurting myself or ruining the wax. I did have a few issues with application and I missed a few spots, but that's alright. I'm a noob. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with everyone! :)
mine is always rock hard then when i manage to get it out its instantly too sticky, sticks to everything and cant get it off my hands...
Thank you so much for this!
I always cook mine exactly to 245 but it's still way too runny and liquidy so idk what I'm doing wrong? I let it go a little more one time but then it got way too hard and overcooked so fdksalfjdskafjdska;jklfsd
I just try this today, and you changed my life. This recipe is amazing, it went exactly as yours, only mine is a little "blondie", because I think it was a whiter sugar. I tried on my leg, and I love it. Thank you!
bugs
Do it work on the bikini area
i cooked the sugar wax until it was 240 degrees and when i took it off and put it in the container, it’s white and it barely browned. did i do something wrong?
Extremely helpful.thank you for experimenting for us all :)
I have a question again. When the sugar is done. Do you put it in the fridge with top on or do you let it cool without top in room temperature first? I get some crystals in the sugar and I put it in the fridge with top on.
Hey can you use this on your face?
My wax won't stick to me 😭😭 I used powder and everything what am I doing wrong
Yo I’m too lazy put this in a jar I’ll buy it
Suga💜
I don't have a thermometer, I'd there any other way I can know if it's reached the soft ball stage?
Not sure if this will get answered since this is an older video BUT, it can’t hurt to try.  First I want to say thank you so much for doing these sugaring videos. They are amazing. I haven’t shaved since I saw them and have done it a few times. I’m having some trouble getting my sugar paste soft enough. I make it to the correct temp (I’m 99% sure I am but my thermometer is broken) and then knead it and follow all your directions. It worked AMAZING the first and second time I made it but since then I’ve had to knead it for like an hour to get it soft enough to use. I can never get all my leg hair. The only thing I’ve really successfully done is my arm pitt hair and I will never go back to shaving. It’s so much thinner than it was before the first time. It does get discouraging when it takes so long to get it soft enough and even then I feel like it’s not quite where it should be.   My question i guess is, since it’s colder now (we keep our house at the warmest 69) will that have an affect? I’ve had to warm it up in the microwave just to make it soft enough to start kneading it to use again. I figured it was because it’s cold and the first two times I used it, it was still really warm in Texas. I don’t want to give up but I’m getting annoyed! Help!!!
My sugar wax is too hard what do I do
Awesome Video! Thanks so much!! <3 I'm living in Vietnam and lemons are quite difficult to find in my province. However, limes are in abundance. Could I substitute Lemon for Lime? Thanks!
Hey! I've been using your recipe and I've had great results! but, what do I do once the paste gets too white and sticky and I can't use it anymore? I tried sticking a new piece of paste to it, but it seems to work just for a little bit. Do I just throw it away?
i'd eat some
I’m so glad the recipe is edible cus when I fail I just mix the sugar with my tea and bam! Hot lemon tea with some prickly legs
Thank you so much for this video. I usually wax but last time I made my wax and slightly overcooked it, it quickly hardened and was hard to use after stumbling on your video decided to knead it and now I just finished sugaring my whole body😍
This is working out great! Can I have essential oils in it?
My first trial I got very hard wax but no worries I just microwave a couple of seconds and I can use it either with a strip or as hard wax. Am happy to come across ur video. PS I did mine without a thermometer 🤗
Just a quick side note, this shit smells bomb while cooking.
This was actually informative and I’m just now willing to give sugar wax another try finally. Thank you for making such a useful video!
Erm I just tried making sugar wax today but when I kneaded it, it just making solid after a while. Am I not using enough liquid?
I've done it last night! i was aiming for a soft wax and ended up with the hard wax lol but it still worked! Not as good of a bikini wax as a professional does it, but not too bad for first timer :) this was a very helpful video!
Very helpful!
Can you pleaseee make a face hair removal ?
This is an amazing video. Thank u for doing the work!
THANK YOU
Huh. I made some yesterday and while initially it looks perfect, it did turn really goopy as soon as it warmed up a tad. I realize now I didn't put enough sugar in. Duh
Is that edible? If i made that and its edible i would eat it all!
So this is giving me quite a lot of trouble. First I cooked it to 235 cus it’s really cold in my house. But that literally was almost soupy even after a full day of cooling. So I reheated it to 355 and it’s still not usable. Idk what I’m doing wrong or if there’s a missing ingredient.
So I made some sugar and it came out really really really hard and dark- I didn’t have a thermometers the time that went above 200•f (I’ve been moving so it’s been in a cool dark box for about 2 weeks) so would I be able to warm it on high for 30 second intervals until i can pull some out or is that safe to just use a stick and wax cloths instead?
When you remove it from the range do you pour it in the container right away? Or wait till it cools a bit?
So the hard wax is better for doing sensitive areas though right? I keep trying to heat it up for my brazilian but its always so hot and by the time it cools enough its too hard for me to use it 😭
BTW...is there a way to add fragrance to wax?
Great video! I think I was adding too much water to my first batch when kneading. I ended up with a gooey mess! My next batch I'm going to try not kneading it.
So I made it like this the cold wax version cause I live in a hotter climate and left it to cool down and then I took out a piece and formed a ball between my fingers after playing with it and now its not sticking to my skin even after I have powdered my skin?
Lol
Most confusing video ever.
Yooo watched a few of ur vids and honestly the content has blown me away! Quality helpful/educational/self-care/beauty/skincare vids that’s rare to find nowadays especially w/ how saturated YouTube is now. SUBSCRIBED!! 💚
It is our traditional way in my family and we make it at home and I’m so professional to use it easily on the body.. and we put olive oil after we finished because it help us to have less hair ❤️❤️ I’m from Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦
My stupid self just noticed you can eat this cuz deadass it’s just sugar water and lemon juice
How long does the sugar have to be at the desired temperature for? I removed mine as soon as it hit 240 for example, but it ended up being way too undercooked.
So. In the first video you said whisk constantly but you didn't do that in this video and how would you even do that while holding a thermometer in there
So use sugar & water then boil it at those temperatures for how long ?
So what do I do if I don't have a thermometer? I tried twice. The first time I used with lemon, but I added sugar. I was able to use it. The second time I used lime and it became like a hard fiber. Help 😣
I tried sugaring for the first time and it failed so I threw the ball away and ate the rest
I tried this MANY times. Failed every time. I'm still at the hair-pulling stage. It always hardens sooo quickly to a state where it is not usable as anything other than candy. What am I doing wrong? Right now my biggest problem is once I reach the point which you say we should start kneading, I can't because it's too hot (and I can't exactly wait for it to cool because it hardens so fast that it becomes unmanageable by that point.) I'm so confused and frustrated. I'm going to try again one last time before I throw my pots out the window. XD
I’ve been undercooking my wax all this time 🤦🏽‍♀️
I didn’t mind messing this up so many times until I gave myself 2nd degree burns :-)
in the description you say 0.25 water nd lemon juice do you mean quarter cup or a quarter of a littre. Im confused :/
im about to give up ive watched your videos so many times and it just keeps failing in every possible way
When I first tried it it definitely worked and it hurt like crap but the results were awesome. But now I don't have lemon juice so I'm not sure if I can still make it.
Hi! 🙊I live 3600 meters a.s.l (La Paz, Bolivia) and I can't get my sugar right I'm trying to make the soft ball but it doesn't work. Maybe its the atmospheric pressure? Water boils at 185°F here instead of 215°F. If you have any advice please let me know. I love your videos!❤️🙊❤️
Why is the lemon juice needed?
Subbed, ur amazing
Can I eat it.
Can we eat it?
Looks like slime
Awesome
rly nice tutorial. i tried sugaring for the first time, today, with the ordinary sugar available here ;) ...  (i only epeeled feet and arms, but i'm impressed). lovely greetings from germany ^^
When I do waxing I get small bumps all over the place I waxed , how can I prevent them?
Please make a video on how to apply
No idea why this was in my recommendation sec....lol But alrighty then I'll try it lol
What’s the “correct temperature”?? Edit: and does it expire?
this video is amazing. thank you. i just have a couple questions.  do you have sensitive skin? if so does this help with not having razor bumps?
If I want to  wax my bikini area what wax should I use? The soft, firm or hard wax?
If I want to use it with strips, I generally like that better, how warm should it get then? Thanks for a really good video!
I wish this video had existed years ago! When I first started sugaring, it was really difficult to make the wax. I had a lot of failed attempts before finally getting it right. Even then, I only knew how to get it right strictly by judging the colour. You know the science behind it and explain everything so well👏
Mine just became a really hard ball
all the comments are good so I’m hoping it’s actually good??
excellent
Professor of sugar waxing ❤️👍
THE SECRET HAS BEEN REVEALED!!! I can't find the proper words to thank you. So the planet and my skin thank you from the heart!
you acting like we all have a random ass thermometer lying around
If I want to use the woven strips to pull off the wax, what temperature should I cook until?
You can still eat this tho ?
Hi I cooked my sugar to 250°f but it wasn't the same color as yours as in it was really light and yellow
Worked first time, thank you!
I would love it if you made another video on the second sugar that you undercooked as I think that is a consistency I would prefer to work with. Thank you so much!
What was the ingredients and amounts of each again?
Do you start timing your sugar at first when it's already mixed and placed in the cooking pot?
Have tried some different recipes, this is the first one working for me! But I had to boil it to a higher temperature, 262 F.
You have given me hope. I have failed making this so many times. Going to give it another go!
With caramel? 😯 How do you not end up eating it all? I’m such a sweet tooth!
I would love to knead this but my body temperature is naturally hot. Like... walking heater hot. So it just turns into the paste when it was in your pocket lol
So if you make a wax too hard or at the hard ball stage you just need to warm it a little to use? What if it's Rock solid? Do you still just get it warm enough to use?
Making me wanna try homemade wax again🤔🤔.. I’ve wasted a lot sugar before tho
This mixer is being  after cold so hard that I can't use it How can i keep this mixer soft?? Need help
I don't have a thermometer ☹ is there a way to do it without one?
Quality video
anyone catch the vine reference? thicker than a bowl of oatmeal or just me ?
Ok this last method is my last shot. Because I've tried for years to get the kneading way down and it never works. I've tried taking it off at a lighter stage, darker stage. Somehow i always put too much water on my fingers to stop the sticking, or the wax gets to hard, or it's undercooked. I tried three times today alone because all of your videos gave me hope... but still didn't work.
I can watch your videos over and over again.  I have made the second and third hard waxes along with the durt scrub and the soothing salve, the deodorant and will be making the lotion bars soon. I am so glad I found your channel.  Now my mom, sisters and nieces want me to wax them. 🤪☺️. Thank you for all your DIYs and look forward to more in the future.  I like the way solar nails look.  Do you have a step by step video on what to use and how to do them or can you recommend any videos?  😉🙏🏼
Every time she rips he hair out i cry
Sorry I got a bit distracted during the video... So I don't have to knead it, I can just let it cool and use it?
Can I eat this
Does it hurt??!
How does your sugar become pliable even when completely cooled? Mine always turn rock hard even though it’s not in the hard stage yet.
Today I was going to do the old recipe, god save the explore thing
Does it have to be fresh lemon or lime or can you use concentrate
شكرا حبيبيتي 😉
I’m literally super hairy (a girl) EXCEPT MY EYEBROWS  Like I have hair all over my stomach and back :(( bUT idk I’m just gonna use this for my lady moustache
Hey, quick question... so I've been sugaring my upper lip for a few months now and recently I've noticed that my upper lip has tiny black spots and it feels a bit grainy ( & extremely dry). I understand that not moisturizing enough might be a cause of that for certain, however, I'm also fairly certain that I may irritate my skin too much (because I have coarse hair and I wax the same spot way too many times). I'm not sure how to fix this or even what to do please help
I did this recipe, but in the microwave like you showed in your other video. I wanted to make a big batch but didn't have a thermometer. I must have cooked it for 10 minutes total with lots of break, I lost track. After that I let it cool in the fridge. I pulled it out not too long before I was ready to use it. I tried using it with my hands but it was just too sticky and my hand got tired really quick trying to manage it. I decided to pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds so it would be easier to work with, but still not too hot. I ended up applying it with popsicle sticks. I cut strips from a used cotton tee. It worked wonderfully well! I was optimistic because I was really excited to try it, but didn't have high expectations either because I often try stuff which doesn't end up working. I was really impressed. I am by no means a waxing expert. I used once the Nair ready to go waxing strips from the pharmacy, which I hated. They were expensive for the amount you get, and it was really annoying to have to separate each strip. Also, the Nair one was more painful and less efficient at getting all the hair. I am a sugar waxing fan now and will definitely keep doing it! No more shaving for this girl!! Thank you so much for all the helpful information you are sharing! Oxoxox
4:50
I tried to do this and I let it go to 121 C but it is still to soft (or watery). When it has reached the right temperature, should I let it boil for a while or take the pan off right away? I took the pan off the stove right away (twice) when it reached the right temperature. But cannot use it.
Can I use lime juice I’m Hispanic I don’t have lemons lmao
I live in a very cold.climate so what should I do?
Can I just buy some caramels knead them a bit and use those?
Can you do it without lemon
So basically, get candy thermometer
Can you wax your under arms with this type of wax
You are the kind of woman who could build what you're doing into an empire. It's so obvious to me, no question. Keep it up! I can't wait to see how you grow.
even with the right temperature, my sugar goes brittle and cracks as soon as i try to knead it
I never succeeded in making this :( mine never turns golden or even a bit dark yellow It's always in that light pale yellow colour  Send help pls :(
Very very well made video.  Content is detailed and very concise!  Subbed 💕💕💕
Yuh lying 🤥 the harden wax dont even take off hair
Love love love. I've always wanted to have a cheap (dirt cheap) waxing option. Perfect
Can you use something else than Lemon juice?
Can you cook it in your wax melt since it has the temperature on it? If so that would be so much easier and worth the purchase! Lol
I suck at making sugar wax. This was so informative. Maybe I’ll try again.
I tried to make but failed.. after watching your video I understood that I under cooked it.  I wasted a lot of sugar 😔..  Hopefully next time when I prepare sugar wax with ur tips it shall work.   Thank you 🙂 for this video..
which would work best for waxing underarm air?
Happy I found this channel. Now im a new subscriber!!
How many grams are the two cups of sugar and how many ml are a quarter cup?
thank you so much for the research and time and love that went into this :)
love this intro aw good video girl!
Oh that was a filter... the first few seconds.. i thought bugs were flying around her hair lols
Ok so the first time I did this recipe it was too sticky and wouldn’t allow me to remove it from my skin. The second time I tried it, it would stick to my skin but wouldn’t pull any hair off and would harden very quickly. I’m so lost.
Thank you so much! I made my first batch yesterday and certainly used too water. How can I salvage the batch that I made do I need to heat it again and add more sugar?
You make really good videos!!
Very informative one of the best videos made on sugar wax on here! Thank you
Which do you prefer to use and do you prefer kneading or not?
Best video omg thank you
What temperature did you make your wax stripe sugar wax?
Hi girl, I'm spending my days making sugering wax for the moment. When I reach the temperature (121 celcius) I'm taking of it from the heat but it's way to soft. Do I have it to cook a few seconds on the right temperature. I do not understand that part. Thank you for all your help in the video's!
I got myself a thermometer and reached the temp for softball stage, it stayed almost clear. It cooled and I kneaded ot and it became powdery! WTF!?! I thought it was because I didn't caramelized it, but I tried to do that a second time and it became candy because I went to 350 by accident 🤦. I was using the 1/2 cup of sugar +2 tbsp of water +2tbsp of vinegar  recipe. I still have hope.
If you have thick coarser hair that’s curly should you use the former wax?
But I don't have a thermometer :// how can I know if I have a right paste? Should I use the soft or firm?
i want to eat it 😔     is it just me ? i know that weird
So what if I was kneading the sugar and put too much water on my hands? It’s slightly too liquidy. Help? ):
Thank you for this video!! I made it yesterday and it works amazingly
Hi abetweene. I watched your video's a lot and thank God: I can do sugering! Hoeray! But I can mostly use one sugarball 3 or 4 times, it's sticky very fast. Why is that? Can I use less water or... Softball I cannot use because its sticky directly. Maybe your experience can help me.
Yes, please make more sugar waxing videos!!  Thank you for your hard work in doing the research for us. 👍🏼🙏🏼
P.s. I didnt use powder .. it made my wax  finish faster .. the natural skin condition worked out  just perfect for me .. ❤
I m totally in love with yr no knead wax.. tried it and because of all the stages u shared.. it got made just perfect ! N the results are amazing ! Stay blessed 😘  I have tried sugaring before but always gave up but each of yr tips and tricks helped me through and through .. Where ever i would be stuck one of yr tips would be replaying in my head in yr voice n i would calm down .. buck up and get on .. . Thanks a ton ❤❤❤❤
This was so great and informative. Good job! One question though, is it safe to use this type of wax on the bikini area?
but some time letter it is hard
Wow. I have been wanting to try it, but there are so many ways people have come up with, that I became confused and overwhelmed. Maybe I'll try it now.
So yesterday I made wax. I tried to let it sit Forever then mixed it with my hands but it was so sticky. Did I not Cook it long enough?
It look easy, but It wasn't. Cant put too much water, the answer will be the right temperature. After a week, it still soft? I hope I will get it right tomorrow.
Do you heard about the ingredient called 'guar gum' ? It makes your paste even more elastic and smooth - do you also try this in your recipe?   I have some guar gum here but I don't know if this really works...🤔
Can you use this on your face?
Yasssss
So which one is best for bikini area?ive never done down there before but i just want to do the bikini area and dont know which stage to use.
Mine isn’t bubbling
Can you go over the same area twice if there are small hairs left?
Don't have a thermometer
Do i really need lemon juice for this recipe
thank u for ur hard work
CAN U EAT IT?
Oh come mine is hot and then when i try to soften it, it gets cold and hardens
Amazing video!
Damn your elaboration is more comprehensive than my professors in college
What size is the white pot you're using?
Great instructions! Thanks a lot!!! got great wax as a result, very pleasant to work with and very efficient:-)))
This is the most helpful sugaring video I’ve watched, thank you
Loved this video so informative and helpful💛
how did you made the thick soft wax? i also like the firm hard wax but i always failed to do it T_T
Can the sugaring mixture be used without the strips? If so, what temperature is best to cook it to?
Another trick to know if your sugar is done by putting few drops in cold water, if it comes together, then it's done :)
What do i do if i dont have a thermometer?
Ahhh thank you!! I struggled so bad the last time I tried to make sugar. Hopefully this video will be what I need to succeed next time I try! I'd like to echo the sentiment of - please do a step by step/in depth vid on how to actually use the wax.  It's definitely a 2 part process to get 'er right haha
yees! I literally juust tried making it for the first time a few hours ago and I had to have undercooked mine because it solidified but kept melting on me when I tried kneading it. Thank you so much for sharing! xoxo
Omgosh this video was the most informative I've ever seen! An I have watched solo many. I never leave comments but i really wanted to say thanks for all the info. Loved it!!!
Very informative! Thanks!☺️
hi! can I ask what your editor is?
Am I the only one who just wants to make this so I can play with it
Does sugaring hurt? And is there a possibility my skin might turn red afterward since I’ve never once removed my leg hair
I might end up eating this
If i live in a warm/hot environment which one do i do?
I am a native Spanish speaker, you have the most comprehensive tutorial(s) as far as I have seen and I am an expert in sugaring. I have been using it for at least 8 years and have has fails and GOALS. The only point you forgot to mention is that NOT ALL SUGARS HAVE THE SAME POINTS YOU MENTION, white normal sugar is not going to cook at the same point as brown or blonde sugar. and I love that you mention the “hot or cold climate” some people don’t (so they think the sugaring method ain’t going to work ever). If you live in a warm climate and feel your sugar is getting too soft too soon try using it in a room with A/C (to a not so cold temperature) or if you don’t have air conditioner try using it during the coldest hours, between 10pm-4am trust me at makes a difference. Also having your hands cool down a little before handling or taking a cold bath 15 min before using (or just wash your hands with cold water).
damn im gona try this i wasted so much sugar my mom hates me lmao
back here to post an update. i tried to make the runny type of sugar to use with wax strips but ended up cooking it to a softish medium ball state.  i was sure it would loose its stickiness if i started kneading, (usually 30+ Celsius where I live; and the heat of my hand would have made it melty).  so i used an icecream stick to apply and flick it off and it somehow worked :)
I have a sugar kit that I won from submitting a horror story about the results of a bad waxing experience, the product seems to be consistent with the jar just before the one that is so hard you can't get the sugar out. But I still would like more info on the accessories used like where to purchase inexpensively.
Id love another video with a bit more info. This is great.
Do.you have to use lemon juice?
I have no interest in sugaring at all, but those videos are weirdly satysfying and have an element of witchcraft to them, so thanks!
The under cooked wax that is still usable with stripes, any chance you know the temperature? that's the one I would prefer to do.  Your sugaring videos are very informative and have been the best I've seen so far. (Edit - Ok if I would of looked a newest comments would of seen you already stated this was one you didn't use thermometer) will be looking forward to your update of this)
I have, after a million trial-error events, mastered the sugar wax recipe, and I think this is the best video about that subject here on YT ! This will save so many failed sugaring attempts out there !!! LOVE IT !
Wait. So how do you make the more liquid one? The dark one with the strip?
I tried it with vanilla and milk and I eat it up that was tasty
Ugh yess thank you. lol trying again
you da real MVP
OR.........You could buy Nair. Painless hair remover sold at your local family dollar, last longer then shaving and painless. The price Depends on your location but I bought mines for about 5 bucks.    So yeah.......
Some other tips for when cooking sugar, from a recent pastry graduate: Use nylon coated gardening gloves if you are kneading the sugar while it's still warm. You can get these for super cheap at any place that sells your basic gardening supplies. Please be careful when working with it. It may feel nice and cool on the outside, but it can still be piping hot on the inside. Just be patient. This is another advantage of having gloves, so that if the sugar is too hot to work with, you'll feel the heat, but it reduces your chances of getting burned dramatically.  Brush the sides of your pot with water as the sugar cooks to prevent crystallization. I would also suggest to keep an ice bath (bowl of ice and water) on standby to be able to shock your pot after it has reached temp, this will prevent the sugar from cooking even further. Please please be careful when working with sugar. I was working on an advanced level and people were still burning themselves left and right, so take every precaution to prevent burns. If you do get burned, I swear by mustard. I know it sounds weird, but it helps so much, apply it to the affected area and wrap with plastic wrap. Later, you can cover it with aloe vera and let it breathe.
mine was vv watery, did i not boil it long enough?
idk why mine ends up being to liquid even though i put even smaller amount of water than lemon juice. any advice?
And you are genius
So informative! Thank you so much!
Do you think it would be safe to wax my beard with this? :(
Can you just heat the firm wax up to make it more soft for the process or no ?
I just saw the thumbnail...thought it was slime recipe...
I tried Brazilian wax...... omgggush it hurt so much😭😭
ماكو احد يترجمه ؟
You're like a scientist for auger wax
Your voice is so soothing
Is it safe to do a sugaring wax on your private area
Please do an how to apply it cold.
is it fine for my sugar wax not be stored on a fridge because the wax that i made became so hard when i put it on the fridge and i have to heat but its so easy to be sticky
What if you don’t have a candy thermometer :(
So I have a question... Please answer this  Ok so I happened to make an undercooked wax, according to your video, and I didn't want to waste the was and throw it away. So I was wondering if I could like make it more harder by putting the wax back into the pan and then cook it again? Idk if this makes sense, but please answer the best you can. Thank you
Do you have to kneed every single piece you use with the soft wax?
THANK YOU i tried 3 times last week and you inspired me to try again!! thank you for following up
Can you do a segment on how to purposely make the liquid version of sugar? I’m gonna try to use the strip sugar for my legs and brows 😬 And by purposely, I mean, is strip sugaring the same recipe as hard sugar but just cooked less? Or is it a different recipe all together?
which temperature did you cook the one at 5:24 to?
Before I made 2 batches of sugar wax! Perfect thanks to your vids! Now...I am trying to knead and it just turns into a hard clear mess kinda like a jolly rancher...what am I doing wrong now??
can i use lime instead
What temperature did you cook the soft sugar that you used the wax strips with? I prefer using wax strips.
Thank you so much for this vid!!!!! I love your editing so much :)))
So a quarter cup means 1 /4    cups yes?
Wow, this is such a great and in depth video to all of the questions I’ve had while basically praying for the best every time 🙈
I tried to make sugar wax and did everything right except the kneading, ill try again thank you for the video
Thank you I appreciate
Im doing this on my boyfriends back right now... Lets hope it works! :D
Make another video of this please
Thank you for putting the temperatures! I’ve failed too many times trying to make sugar wax. I gave up and bought an epilator. Lol Now I’ll try it again. 😉☺️
Why doe is harden? I'm trying here for 5hours at least, only the first batch was ok. I don't have a thermometer!!!😭😭😭
So damn informative 🤓🍬
I guess I’m a fool 😂 I can’t seem to get it right. I either burn myself every time or it just doesn’t stick to my skin.
Ugh 4th maybe 5th time making and no goood!   I feel I’m making it to a golden brown then I let it cool and as soon as I start kneading it gets hard and won’t even stick to my skin!  I tried putting it straight into my skin and it feels too hot! I made another batch tonight and same thing it gets too hard once I start kneading it. I even let it melt in my hands for a few minutes and wasn’t sticking to my skin and it got hard  quickly. What am i doing wrong?!?
Thank you so much,this video was very helpful for me😊
Warning do not try this at home,  if you don't know what you doing I have 1st degree burns now lol
When u said the hairs get finer each time, I was sold😂
You should honestly just make a partner channel that's dedicated entirely to sugaring and hair removal ur so helpful then most youtubers out there😋
It would be awesome if you can show us how to sugar wax but the face? Because sometimes if it’s too hot it can burn the skin and if it’s too hard it can hurt the skin too! I live in the Caribbean, near Cancún, so it’s really humid and hot nd I’ve been trying to wax since your first video popped!! So def going to try the hard wax, it just hard for me to kindle but I guess it will get better over time, thanks a lot gurrrlll!
Yes please make another video!!!
I would love a step-by-step guide to how to use/do sugaring, hot and cold. I really want to try sugaring. I'm an expert at making caramelized sugar (am a pastry chef), so if I can use this at home it will likely save me quite a lot of money. Thank you!!
Ahhh fuiiii!!! I under cooked mine!! Hahah I used a bandana and pulled hahah it worked alright but this helps so much more!!!!
Can you eat it
I did .5 cup sugar and 2 tbs of lemon juice and water following the cold wax method. I did the soft ball stage (235-240 degrees F) and the paste completely burnt ..? Any tips??
I drank my mixture...
I’d eat it all before actually using it
Omg, after tons of efforts, today I finally MADE IT! Thank you a lot 😘😘😘
Very loud and bold as per
should my soft wax get harder and darker as i let it sit in a cold room?
Did you say how to get the "undercooked result but still useable" type of sugar? I prefer to use wax strips and that looks like it would work for me.
It literally tuns to candy EVERY TIME !
i have a problem in my country theres only lime lemon not the yellow lemon only the green one!!! can i do it with lime lemon?
Don’t do this because wax can cool but melted sugar can not it will burn u
How can i fix my over cooked sugar paste?it turned out into a stone  Plz tell me
Im planning to make this but im scared of how will it hurts, do you have some tips for it for first timers?
I was just in the shower shaving my legs, again, and thinking about how the sugar wax I bought on amazon doesn’t work. I think I’m heating it up to much..? Or maybe I just need to make my own cause they didn’t cook it properly for my humid climate. Thanks for the knowlege
3:37 is if u hate someone give them a “candy” filled with ur hair :))))
How long does the cooking process take ? 😭
Still use fahrenheit really? meh...
Slime
No knead for what??
Can I eat it? O_o
I've finally been able to do it!!!! Thanks to the pour and store method!!! I realized that I had been cooking my sugar to a hard state and the only way to use it properly was to burn myself. So now I cook it so a soft state and I'm able to use it. I already made 3 successful batches and waxed my arms, hands, feet, and underarms . It's been a productive day :) thanks for all your videos!!!!! They finally helped me to figure this sugar waxing out
Very detailed & informative. Thank u !
Loving your channel, very informative and helps me save money. Thanks 💖
Mine never turns out this dark...I wanted to do the soft wax to pour and let sit, because I've burnt myself a couple times now.... oops. But am I cooking it too hot too fast? I don't understand.. I did this last night and it barely changed colors. I cooked it to 242 degrees. It seemed too sticky like you show here and it just spread clear. So I put it back on the stove till 250 and this morning it was hard as a rock lol.... I've wasted soooo much sugar trying to get this right.... I can't figure out for the life of me what I'm doing wrong. I'm using a candy thermometer too. Any advice anyone can give me would be soooo appreciated! I really want this to work...
I overcooked! But i made cute sugar flowers
Can you use any other sugar?
Idk why this was in my recommendations but csnddyyy
I did one cup of sugar to ¼ cup of water+lemon and my sugar hit 245F in less then 5 mins and with no color change... is that normal?
What stage of sugar is the one where you knead it and use it as is without strips? Like in your first video?
i made this sugar wax but when i started to knead it, it just got way too hard and i couldn’t knead it anymore! any tips? ❤️
Thank you so much!
Tested it right now! Hope I did not messed up!
Subscribed 💞
💜 Just give us all the self care tips and tricks you use #Blessed 💜
Thank u so much for this I already know how to make one because my mom used sugaring since she was young. and her mom. and grandma 😂
Oh yassssssss. Thank for this! 😘
OH THANK YOU BLESS YAH HAART GIRL
This video saved my life
actually this method was anciently used in Egypt :))  so as an Egyptian girl we can find this sugar wax already packaged :)))  and with different types like with rose, honey, regular, honey made from sugar cane!! 😀 and we call it black honey too!!!!  so we just get it, open it,  warm it up a little then ready to use!!!!!!  thank God I'm livivng there so i can find it easily!!!!!  😀 and the sugar wax generally does a scrub to your skin, make your hair grow late and couple of years using you'll find it out that tge cells has died and there is no hair!!!!!😀😀😀😀 of course it depends on how much hairy you are
oh my goodness you just answered all my questions !! thank you so much
I tried this recipe but my paste is not sticking to the skin
In the first video when u finished kneading the wax how long did u wait to use it or can u just use it straight after kneading
Where do you live? So I can get an idea of what a "very hot climate" is compared to where you are
I waxed my arms for the first time with your recipe and techniques..... And it worked!❤ I have wasted so much sugar before I watched your video!😂 Thank you🌸😻
Excellent added this to my watch later
I burn myself using sugar wax. And I hope it doesn't hurt me anymore 😭😭😭😭
I love it how you show how it's all made; You use natural ingredients!
I DID IT!!! Thank you for all the tips 💜😍
Thank you so much for this video! I've seen other videos about sugar waxing but none of them compares to this. You're engaging, comprehensive in your scope and very informative. I love it. I'm super grateful and subscribing!
I wish I saw this today before I made mine and fucked it up lmfao
The second “undercooked” sugar is what I’ve been trying to achieve.
I just found your channel and I love it!
What's the optimal temperature to store them at?
Awsome
3:25 “thicker than a bowl of oatmeal”  she has me R O L L I N G 😂😭
that first clip has been me about sugaring so thanks :-)
hey! so, i’ve tried making the wax twice, once with the pour and store method and the other time i tried kneading it and none of them worked. the first time i did it the sugar was extremely hard after storing it (i even heated it up and it worked but only for a couple of seconds) and the second time it seemed perfect until after i kneaded it, when i took the ball out of the container it was not sticky enough, i got really stretchy and in a couple of minutes it just turned into a hard candy.  both of the mixtures looked a little lighter than the ones i the videos. any idea of what i might be doing wrong?
The paste aint gonna do it till i use it
Thank you soo muchhhh ive been waxing but also shaving for years and my hair is still as thick as ever!! i have no hope for finer hair 😭😭😭
How do you make the thick syrup that needs a cloth strip? I would like to try to wax that way.
Can you eat it...
After watching this video I'm willing to try sugaring again 😁
Do you have a video on how to prevent ingrown hairs my legs look like a speckled strawberry 😭 it's horrible lol btw thanks for making these sugar waxing videos. **I refuse to give up 😃
Do I still need to oil my container?
WICKED AWESOME, SUPER HELPFUL VIDEO!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THR CLARIFICATION!!!
Yes more sugaring videos pls
4:51 thats strange because everytime I make a sugar wax I want it to turn that color so it's just perfect, but my consistency is like honey its not like yours shown in the video. If i overcook it it turns black and cant be used anymore.
I've been using wax for years.  I started with soft wax, tried hard wax and hated it, eventually tried another type of hard wax and loved it, and have been using it since.  I've never used sugar, but may do so as long as I can keep it in my wax warmer.  I like that you show actual hair on the strips once they're used, whereas most commercials for shaving or waxing are on an already hairless person :v
I had a batch made few days ago, and after I watched this video I realized mine is in the hard ball stage consistency. So I tried kneading the little amount I managed to scoop out. At first it looked like it'd be a success (the ball was starting to get opaque while glossy) but it ended up melting down on my fingers. Any advice?
I need to try sugaring every time  i shaving   irritates  my skin  is sugaring  cruelty free
You are a sugaring QUEEN!!! Your efforts speak in the video! Thank you so much <3
You are a blessing💯fr
Would be great to see more videos on this topic! Thank you!!
Omg thanks, I have try many times to do it myself with the first video and it only gets to syrup stage 😂😂😂 now I understand ... So helpful 💕✨ Let's try it again 😂😂
Yes can we get another video on using cold vs warm?
Does it hurt?
Yessss make a sugar wax series already!!!  Lol
Yes i would love another video!!! I have made your wax according to the other videos you had made and it worked. It does wax but it does leave patches but I'm also new to just waxing in general so I'm sure it's a process I have to get use to and get better at but it seems like the more liquid wax that you pull off with wax strip strips to be more effective in getting all the hair off. Could you do a video on that specifically??
Can you show how to prep the skin?
Best information I've found in years! Thank you!!!🤗 Just like making candy as a kid. And taffy when you pull in to add air. Charm! X
Your channel is so dope!
I’m so confused now🤷‍♀️
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Pls i'm wating for the how to use it video ❤thx you so much 😙
Yessss I would love a video on the proper techniques. Especially for face and underarms!
i waxed my underarms and they got so irritated and i thought maybe cause it was the first time but it happens every time now. Any tips? no probs in any other area tho
How long can it stay stored before it goes bad or it is no longer usable?
In your beginner wax tutorial, the recipe was 1 cup sugar, 1/4 lemon and 1/4 water when you double it. On this video you do 2 cups with 1/4 lemon and 1/4 water. Was your beginner video the wrong ratio?
I want to see how to apply sugar and how to use it cold and warm cause I just tried it and failed and I need to wax I look like a hairy bear
Yeah I failed at mine keep the more tips on sugaring and can u make more videos about this
Which temperature do you cook yours to?
I adore you so much dang
I'd like a video on how to apply sugar, cold and warm! ^^ thank you for your detailed help!
I live in a cold climate so I’m excited to try the soft wax! Thanks for the incredible detail in this video.
Best video ever made on sugaring! I’ve been going through YouTube sugaring tutorials for 12 years (feeling old), so I know what I’m talking about🤓
Sis! I've struggled so much with this thank you. Last time it was too warm, but i was trying to use it before it got to stiff/hard. I'm either over cooking it or under, can't get it right. I think my measuring was off too. 🙄 I'm determined to get it tho! Can't use toxic Nair or shaving anymore
This is awesome! More please! :)
loving these video. gracias!!!
By far the clearest sugaring videos I've ever seen. I love your style of video. Thanks!
bro kneading with hands is actual hell i burned the entire tip of my finger and it looks like freaking megamimd😭
every time ive tried to make a sugar wax it aways hardens uo when i knead it? like it becomes rock solid, any advice for what i can do?x
yeessss plz 😘😘
My sugar NEVER hardened
I tried the sugaring method epic fall honey 😂 So this point I need more videos please. And your voice is so soothing... I love it 😍😍😍😍
Trying this today thank youuuuuuu!
Hey, does sugaring make you break out on your face?
I literally tried this a few hours ago and burnt my fingers so I gave up. I was too early!
Much better thank you
You're the one and only account i feel can teach me the art of sugaring. Thank you!!
Every time I start to knead/pull me sugar it turns hard. Like a sucker. And I can’t restore it from that even by heating it up. Am I heating it too much?
more please, I am very hairy and just wanted to know how is the best way to remove all the hairs,  paste or with fabric?
if I ever succeed, it'll be entirely because of you.
Please do more, girrrrl I got deeeeeep DEEP neck hairs that just won’t go and I don’t feel like paying 12 dollars for a wax 👎👎👎😭😭
I would love to see a video on how to apply both types of wax, hot and cold!! Thank you so much for all your hard work trying to help us understand exactly how to do this! It’s so appreciated💜 the only thing Is... sometimes I get a little confused/find it hard to follow along when you start to explain things because I feel you start talking a bit too fast. In no way am I trying to put you down or be rude, I just figured I might as well give honest input because you don’t know whatcha don’t know, ya know? 😏😋 Thank you again for all you share with us!
Thank you for the detail in this 👌
You deserve more subcribers ❤❤
5:46 that happened to me if i didn’t use any water it would stick and if i did it would turn liquid, do i need to heat it up more? someone help!! lol
Guys!! You don't have to throw away wax that's too soft!!! If you wanna use it, I suggest using it cold (assuming it doesn't have too much water or is undercooked)   Ok so I've been sugaring for 4+ years now so I've made all these mistakes lol I live in a really hot area (120+ summers) so kneading is really goopy & once I've overused the hard sugar until it looks like caramel, I'm covered in a goopy mess. So I've found that the best way to come back from it without just washing it off is to grab ice or a cold pack & apply it to the wax until it becomes really hard & comes off in one big strip. You can keep doing that to wax or you can just throw it away without making a big sticky mess
Girl exactly what I needed! I was left with some questions from your last video and now all solved! Thank u🙌🏽
THANK. YOU.
You make good videos
Pls can you make a turbinado sugar wax video x
Did you store the paste in a refrigerator? If i did that will it be too hard to use?
I burnt myself using the wax in a "warm" state. it felt cool to the touch but when I spread it on my leg the heat set in and BURNT MEEEE. so now i have a hideous burn and hairy legs as I wait to attempt it again. I WILL PREVAIL
God bless u sugarqweeen
Thank you soooooo much for this it worked for me like twice but I have had more fails . When I’m kneading it ends up either getting to to wet or sticks to my hands and gets all sticky .This will be much easier I’m definitely gonna try this now.
DID I ENJOY?? You bet your thiccc bowl of oatmeal I did! Can’t wait for more!
I needed this so bad! Thank you so much! 💖😍
*Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal*
I’m hella scared to do this but I’m ready thanks to all the videos in this series. Also thanks for putting the links to purchase
YES MORE PLS
your videos are just so pleasing to watch! thank you! i'm going to try the wax strip type of sugar paste.. wondering if it will be easier to use.
🙏 Thank you!
What if u don't have a thermometer :(((((
This saved me a lot of sugar money.
Didn’t try the first video you made on this but I think I am going to try this one
Damn girl I literally just had my mom wacking at my armpits with over cooked sugar wax. 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃 where was this video???
Yay makes my day when you post! I am for sure going to try this!!!
i love your videos they are so aesthetic and good quality!
Thank you! Enough accidental burning from trying to knead the paste. Yay! Will try it. Again lol
Yes more videos please!!
TYSM FINALLY YESS I LOVE UR VIDEOS
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT ALL MY FAILED ATTEMPTS AT SUGARING AND THIS NOTIFICATION POPPED UP???? THANK YOU??????
