Men of culture, we meet again!
What a great idea. I was going to buy a large wrench and car jack from Harbor Freight but this method is just as fast and requires no $$$. Thanks very much!
You're one amazing woman.  I've always struggled, too. Thanks for the tip.
beautiful woman playing in wet mud 🤔🇬🇧
Who ever put those posts in was an idiot.
They're not cemented in. The cement would come out with the post
Another great video
use the three point lift on tractor
The next owner is like "  Why won't my fruit trees grow in this soil ?  "  lmfao hahhahahha.
Great work chica!
Great for steel posts, But what about concreted  pressure treated posts?
Gonna try this after watching 20 videos of the man way.  Probably gonna have to do this myself too!
You are hot af.😳
I am 40 this year as of May 12, which is already long past. I figured this out when I was 10 years old.  However, I will agree with you and saying that it is so much easier   Only problem is if it uses a lot of water   Pressure washer makes it faster
I was able to remove two t posts  today with only a half gallon of water each 👍🏾
Thank you for this video! Used this technique to remove an satellite dish with concrete pole at the bottom
I need a cigarette after watching that.
Great idea.
Good man. How far is she? Cobus👀🐳
the fact she did this without getting muddy is more impressive
You really know you way around that hose. Reminds me of playing in the dirt with a hose on a hot summer day as a kid. Nice job!
What? Oh, the post?
Too bad I’m already married.
concrete still in the ground though.  wont be able to use the same hole locations for the new posts.
Just dig one side.  Bingo!
I need a woman in my garden.  I think...
Farm jack?
Girl too much work. Use some water and a two by four. No digging lol
Wow! That was easy. Wish I would of thought of that.
Thy this..much much easier and faster....https://youtu.be/_CXKespERNo
Good idea. I'm just concerned with all the water being wasted to remove a post(s). Especially in California with all the water restrictions we have. Other videos use Leverage to remove.
I’m on my way to go pull out a post and install a double swing gate. Mine has concrete tho. I’ve been soaking it the last hour on a very slow trickle. I see your method. I had the same idea! I have to dig two holes in rocky hard dirt for the gate tho. Ugh wish me luck! ❤️

I don't even have a chainlink fence but i'm interested ;)
believe me i could really take out this within 10 minutes. n hot weather i don't mind.
Would this method work with a metal mailbox post?
That was awesome !! Great idea
Girl power!!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
This is genius! I don’t know if it’ll work with the soil we have but I’m going to give it a go! Thanks
This method worked really well for me. I was amazed. I didn't want to hire someone or buy a tool that I'd only use once — so DIY was the only option. I hunted around quite a bit and this method felt really accessible. It took me about 30 minutes to remove 4 posts.
I wish I had seen this sooner. I had a T post to remove and couldn’t make any headway so I ended up digging down a few inches and cutting the post off with an angle grinder!
you're a badass! my husband and I just used your method and we were done with everything in the same amount of time that it would've taken to do one! thank you!
Here in Colorado in December had 2 sides of fence blow down in windstorm. Thought about this, but doesn’t work in freezing temps with ground dry & frozen.
Great, Not as sexy but if you stick a section of PVC pipe to end of hose you wont have to get on your knees. You can just tape it on, or go to a home depot/lowes and get a couple of fittings to attach pipe to hose. Did appreciate your video. Thank You.  :)
Wat about the concrete ball in the ground
banging body
Who even has random posts in the kit garden?
💋🍓💋🍓🍑💐😍😍🌹💯💯💎💎😋😋
THANKS PRETTY LADY ~ it’s the SAME method I use for pulling weeds out of my lawn ( of course on a smaller scale but SAME PRINCIPLE ) !
Just cut posts below grade and leave the footers, next.
Pretty cool lol  thanks :)
Tu es vraiment trop jolie ^^ on n'adore te regarder bb 🌹💗🙌👌
She had bigger arms then me an im a guy
Right on, perfect timing too, thanks! And that's a beautiful pup btw. :)
Nassrin, thanks for making this video!  I have about five fence posts to remove today and I knew there must be an easier way than to dig each one out.
This video just saved me!
Just buy a T post puller on Amazon or tractor supply. Around $50 and they work great!
The easiest method I've come across 👌👌👍
Yum
I always wanted a woman in my life that love to work like this. That's how I can start a good conversation.
I would love to help you. And you can help me put one up. My name is Danny.
wait, post? what post?
Even easier. You can pull it out instantly with a car wheel, a tow rope and your car. Attach one end to base of pole using special no-slip knot. Attach other end to your car. Put the wheel upright and under the rope near the post. Drive forward slowly. Post comes right out instantly.
Damn I watched this video and it kinda turned me on.... Like Al Bundy watching Peggy clean on that Labor day episode
If you have a lot of posts to pull, try a farm jack and a short piece of chain. They pop right out.  You can also use the loader on your tractor, but that requires a tractor. LOL
what fence post?
I tried watering my fence post, still didn't grow.
I wasn’t watching this video and  didn’t know what it was about while listening to it, boy was I in for a surprise! It’s about taking out fence poles. I taught it was something else!
Honey, you are doing it all wrong!!!!!  You are using the incorrect tool to remove the dirt around the post.  Get a pair of POST HOLEDIGGERS, that’s right, POST HOLEDIGGERS and dig 2-3 holes on one side of the existing post, then you will be able to pull that post right over with one hand 🤚.  Post hole diggers are a useful tool for many jobs that most people don’t know about, digging a trench etc.
I'm 68 and in bad shape, seeing you do this help me so much and save me lot's of money. I'm In sandy Florida where the ground is soft. Took me like you said about five mins for each one. I had three to do. Thanks again young lady🙂
Now that's a good one I want forget?
3:19 MARRY ME🙏4:39
A better way is to take a tractor jack and a chain. Wrap part of the chain around fence post and then around the piece of the jack that lifts up. A lot faster than using water
Bolt a 4x4 horizontally on to the post then a jack on each site & done in 5 mins
Good job Nassrin, how would that work in Canada when the posts go down 3-4’ with a concrete bulb to protect against the frost.
Step one: ask husband  Step two: no husband                   ask boyfriend Step three: no husband, no boyfriend                     get one
You could have used a power washer and done it quicker than using a normal hose but then, the video would end too quickly.
Who'd have ever thought to soften the ground with water?  Other than anyone with a brain...
She did it all the hard way. Just get a tractor jack to jack it out.
I’d so love her to come round mine and tug on my post!...obviously when my wife was out shopping!🙄
Have you tried the tire trick?
Very hot mamacita
I've a concreted post stub to remove underground.  My worry is will the technique work if theres nowhere for the dirt water to flow?, as guess its the removal of this by flow which allows the post to be removed.  Maybe an auger'd better.  What do you reckon?
Ace!!!
Fantastic. Now I just have to save $$$, buy a house and pull the fence posts.
Great idea! “A River cuts through rock; not because of it’s power, but because of it’s persistence.” 🙏🏼✊🏼🌺
Cool
you made my post move
Great Job! Thanks for sharing!  :)
“You wanna just keep pushing it in further and further”..... 3 inches in the max
Might help but why you edit it ??? Like it didn't take 3 mins 🤔😁
“Just keep pushing it in further and further”...🤓
there was a fence in this video?
Nice job girl 👍👍👍👍👍
That's working smarter not harder 👍
Idk why youtube recommended me here, but this girl😍😘😘
Its a drill attachment drills and soften the dirt
3:20 that’s what she said
I want to remove fence post now
I kind of laughed a little on that first fence post as I have done that more than once..lol. I never thought of that very awesome and way easier thank you :).
How do you now completely. admire and be impressed by her? Cute as heck gal who isn’t afraid to get dirty, use her brain and work her tail off to improve her home. You go girl!
I don't even have any fence posts but I thought I better watch just in case someday I do. That's the only reason I watched.
its always raining in England - so that's why all our fence posts aren't in straight.
I can pay you to build my fence while I take lemonade all day ..
I bet that pitbull would've got that post right out if it saw a deer or a rabbit. (If it's anything like my pitbull.) They're really sweet friendly dogs, but they're strong as hell compared to other dogs.
How are you getting all that water in there? You didn't dig a huge hole
Dont know where your located but in New England are post are set alot deeper and with way more concrete but hey if it works where your at it is better than manualy digging it out
Fence post removal is one of the few areas In life a woman is satisfied with four minutes rather than twenty five!
Thank you for sharing!
That was Pretty good , Gonna Try it, Thanks
That might be the first time I've ever seen a girl excited about 4 minutes if that's the case I would make a good partner
When you first started picking and I noticed how hard the soil was I was thinking you should put water to it how you came up with that conclusion that's on you but I happen to be a landscape designer and I use water in the lot of my building in demo I'm impressed
interesting idea, however, those posts aren't really cemented in. every fence post I have ever installed or removed has at a minimum an 80lb bag of cement. Corner posts have 4 bags.  It would take a fire hose to and few thousand gallons of water.
Well, I just throughly that 🤪😀😀✌️!!!
I can make it loose in 3 minutes lmao
I seen a good looking women in short shorts... And then after that I all I heard was "semen" and "push it in more till it loosens up" I need to stop watching porn. 😂 But anyway I can't even get my partner to take the rubbish out apparently it's a man's job, so do you mind popping round in those shorts because I can guarantee she will spring into action when she see's you. 😂 Top Job 👍 x
I love 3:17 LOL
I have red clay and yes I agree  when the soil is wet its easier to work with
Don't worry about removing any more posts, I will come do it, and when I'm done I'll make dinner, clean the house, etc...... 😇🤪
Great technique!  If you attached the end of the hose to a 24" length of 1/2" threaded pipe, you can push this down to the bottom of the cement or post making it easier to get the water down to loosen deep soil.  (https://amzn.to/3ncW1io plus https://amzn.to/3o7BHjD) If you use a 90-degree adapter where the hose is connected to the pipe, you have a convenient handle to apply pressure of your weight to sink the pipe deeper (https://amzn.to/2X0uDJs)
Wow, I should have tried your method last week If I give you my address, can you come and show me how to do it! I am in New Zealand
Thank you :-)
Metal post in concrete just whack it with a sledgehammer. The vibration will crack the concrete lose.
I prefer a skidsteer.  I completely removed seven BIG tree stumps, roots include, in about 45 minutes.
Her water bill is £85
Came for short-shorts, stayed for the knowledge.
You can use a car jack to do it with less tine and save the  water
And best of all....it comes with a pool!
🇹🇳🇹🇳Walcom to tunisie
3:15 😉
Wow! What a Beautiful way to remove a Fence Post !
And if you use a jet washer its even easier
I'm in love !!!!!
Thanks Good job.
dynamite
2:40 That's what she said!!!
You are awesome! You saved me time and energy...Thank you
how long would you have to wait to start putting the new post in?
Just started a Patreon so don’t forget to add me for behind the scene pictures and videos 😘 Patreon.com/NassrinsDIY.
I tried this method and it sure made things much easier and faster.Thanks for the video.
So how many clicked on vid. coz the chick,eh ? 😂 Sly way to get subscribers 😏
Would’ve been easier with a basic hand cranked winch
Nice and chido work
All I can say is thank you
You are so strong
Sweet Jesus.
I love all of your videos i didnt even realize what the video was about i had to watch it a second time lol
👍👍👍👍👍🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
angle grinder
Thanks! Plan to use this method to remove an old mailbox post📪
Hey ! That makes sense.  Get the ground good and soft and it'll come out easier
Alright amazing tip!! But why so many poles?
I desperately needed to see this! I was all ready to install a fence as I was told I could do so when I first moved in. Then halfway through the project the manager at this mobile home park says they've decided no more fences. 500 bucks down the drain. The last thing I wanna have to do is pay to remove the posts. So this was very helpful. Thanks again. I'm a "small girl" too. And 57 years old. I'll be so proud if I can do it. And looks like good exercise. LOL
Hi lift jack pulls out post with concrete attached easily
Being the pig that i am, i was kinda hoping for some splashing water,,,  good video tho,, :-)
Thank you for this idea.  I was very frustrated trying to dig out my posts for a fence project.  After watching this video, I tried it out and they popped out in 5 minutes.  You saved my back today!
My method is easier if your relocating them just dig around then just cut them with a diamond blade it takes like 30 seconds...
There is an easier way.
I just stumbled across this video. I careless about removing the fence post. But man, you are beautiful! If I was your husband. You ain't doing that only. :)
Wow girl you do it all... Nassrin.
"It's loosening up, I can feel it". Nearly lost my shit.
Beautiful AND useful lady..
I love the way you handled that hose 😍😍
Great Thanks
A power washer works too if you have one.
3:15 You want to keep pushing your nozzle in further and further till it loosens it up. 😲
I used this method tonight and it took no more than five minutes and a bit of water, but little effort and out came to post all 2.5 feet of the base.  Very Easy to do.  Just use plenty of water.
Ok, now lets hit the shower. I'll wash your back!
sexy
I admire women like you that clearly take care of themselves well but also don’t mind to get down and dirty with work.
A shop vac reduced to 1" will help remove posts. This is most useful when you need to replace posts. You can actually keep the bottom 6 inches of the cavity and tis will give you exact location to replace posts.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️👌🏾🇬🇧💯😇  Love it
Problem is, most posts have a about 2 to 3 feet of concrete anchoring them, especially in the northern climates.
Put your back into it lady 😁
Using the water as a lubricant and it works 👍 smart way
Ok.. will you marry me?
I never thought about using that method 🤔 thanks for the video.
Very clever.
Do I have to wait for the ground to dry and refill with dirt if I want to add a wooden post in it's place?
Yes you got it baby
After I was about halfway through watching the video, I was getting ready to post a comment saying "You can loosen the ground with a pressure nozzle on a garden hose."  Then the garden hose and pressure nozzle made their appearance.
Very impressive! Thanks for the info young lady!
Should have given the dog the hose, it's even easier..😊✌
Nice job.  Your feel must have been soaked, work boots would look fine.
That video is edit to watch easy
Relax guys! At 4:38 she says "cement". I had to replay it a couple of times. 😂
5:10 Take it easy lady you don't need to be so rough with it.
smoking hot lady taking out fence posts got my attention, to be honest didn't take it seriously then when i watched the video.  Defiinitely the way to do it.
Now go check your water bill
Clever.  Thanks. I subscribed.
With that many posts, try filling each post with water, before you start removing them. That should soften up the bottom and make the job even easier.
what you need to put water on !!
I had to remove a metal post that was used as one of the two  to keep a dock in place. We tried for an hour to get it out to reposition. I decided to check out YouTube and found your video. Well son of a gun, it worked. 30 seconds and it came loose. THANK YOU!!!
YOU ARE MY HERO.
I'm glad to see you wearing some gloves. I know many teenage boys who you would totally put to shame with your work ethic. There is a tool farmers use for pulling up posts. I like your way better.
i did push it in and it did loosen up ,hey now i mean the fence post ,weird i watched this i live in an appartment
It totally worked! I've been fighting this pole for two weeks, digging, digging and water did the trick! Thanks a million.
Been doing this for years.  What took you so long to think of it??  Pretty obvious for anyone who hasn't thought of it.
dont break it
Why don't you use gun powder!
I can see how you keep that wonderful look about you with all the hard work you do. Beautiful Video in more ways than one.
That's funny, it got my heart racing also ;)
Your directions were a little hard to follow, so I had to watch the video several times, I hope you don’t mind.  😉.  After watching the video 12 times,  I then realized “I don’t have any fence posts to remove” !! 😜
better if you can water the post over several days.  it's concrete, not cement.
I couldn’t get past the first way! Lawd have mercy. 27 years in the fencing industry. Take a sledgehammer hit the bottom of that line post as close to the ground as you can two or three licks. Put down the hammer use both hands slide the post up and out.
here i would have to ask how much you had to pay of the water it is not cheap here note it costs $1.50 to flash a toilet
"You want to keep pushing it in further and further."  Yes I do!
I was thinking about  using a hose and water but wasn't sure it would work . Thanks for the video and showing me it does work . Good job
If you really need to pull posts, just use a farmjack, but mud wrestling with a pole makes for better viewing entertainment of course.
I love you
Take post hole diggers dig a hole on one side next to the concrete Rock the pole over pull the pole out 1 minute
Wonder woman!
Funny story. Buddy of mine bought a house recently. The owners were the builders and for some reason they only fenced a third of the back yard. Might have been all the needed or wanted since their children were grown and the only had a couple of those little furry ankle biting yippers. First thing he did was call me, my wife and my brother in law over. The 3 guys on fence removal and then fence install to encompass the entire yard. Not that it matters, but the 2 ladies were extremely busy too. Taking their daughter out shopping, getting Italian ice, nails done and because they had just over done it, they relaxed out by the pool and offered to bring us beer as needed.  Anyway, back on topic. We tried digging those fence posts up the “old fashion way” or as your example 1 demonstrates. We had a MASSIVE hole after the first 2 posts. Only 15 more to go. To hell with it he said. Grabbed the recip saw and just cut the posts even at ground level, took us 8 hours in total. He figures to sledgehammer the concrete near the surface, back fill with sand and soil, drop some seed and allow Mother Nature to have her 100-120lbs of concrete. Not a clue why that much. We weighed the 2 posts and corner came in at 127 and next post at 109. Pretty sure a 60lb back of cement would have sufficed. Maybe 85. But why in the hell did he drop 2 or 3 bags in those holes! Good on you for finding a way to remove the posts somewhat easily, but any idea if that method works on posts that are sunk 2 feet and cemented fully? Thanks for the vid.  * Our fence project was in wonderful North Alabama compacted and brick hard red clay. Best method I’ve found for building or removing fences in that crap...call a contractor! LOL! Actually another buddy of ours is a landscaper and he brought his tractor over with a post puller and that thing had a whale of time plucking one out. Lousy bastard deserted us after 1 post claiming he had a $10k contract to go work on. Not that we don’t believe him, just that who in the bloody blue hell pours $10k into their very small yard, or HOW is the real question!
Too much water
Nassrin you are a legend!  I've tried all ways searching for videos and trying to get my fence posts out, but without the essential tools it looked like I was about to give up.  Until I saw your video!  It did the trick without too much effort.  Fantastic!  Thank you very very much ;)
basically the process of removing a post by turning the soil to mud is not a new one
This is the first DIY video that I turned the volume down a lil and watched in the bathroom,, for some odd reason I feel a lil guilty too
I don’t even have a fence and yet I watched this whole video...
Are you single? Asking for someone😄
The cement came out with it too. It was at least 18 inches attached to the pole.
Great video, pulled 4 posts with no help. It was an old clothesline.  Flooded it, and used a long pipe to pry it out. Thanks girl!  It almost floated out!
Beautiful n smart
Good advice! Will have to try this myself. Thank you!!
You just saved my day! Thank you so much. I saw my dad struggling to pull 12 metal stakes and he has been digging furiously.  After seeing your video I told him to stop. I happen to have a high pressure  24 inch hose attachment. After we did your trick, we pulled those stakes like pulling candles from a cake.  I couldn't thank you enough.
I always start at the middle
Great job, just wish there was a way to use/waste less water, im not a fan of seeing people ‘wash’ (waste water) cleaning leaves/grass off driveways/sidewalks in my neighborhood 🤷🏼‍♂️ stay safe 😷🦠
Wow! You made it look easy. I am inspired to work on a fence. I am going to do the opposite and put post in, then down the road use your tip. 💪🦸‍♀️😉
🌹🌹🌹👍👍👍👌👌💋💋💞💞🥰🥰🤗😋imoPIz03102119188
She didn’t get muddy and wet enough for moi but still a great job.
What was this video about I was completely distracted! 😉 👍🏻
Can you come do work in my home ?❤
Wishing I was a fence post for some reason?!!!
manual drilling of an Abyssinian well with a plastic pipe !!!!!!!!!  Супер девочки!!
How many of you were working there? Where are the guys digging?
good jab🎉🎉🎉🎉🌷
this was recommended after my pole video.... and i never would have thought to use a hose... very interesting. tks for sharing
Great and helpful video...Thanks for sharing!!  PS: You Are HOT!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you
Gorgeous
I can't even believe you are outdoors doing any work. If my wife had to go outside to do any type work under the sun she would divorce me.
Best video Nassrin
Just keep pushing it in harder and harder....... i nearly spat my coffee out haha. awesome job.
Wont work in clay soil:(
Gorgeous. Badass, smart, and dog lover. I mean 🤯
Were the fence post cemented?
I pulled my fence posts with my Passat wagon in no time.
Lol
I came here for all the wrong reasons. I do need to remove some posts though
This is called hydro-mining.
I like your energy and your Yankee ingenuity.
Thank you for the video!
Hummm charmante
think that's easy? i got a day laborer to do all mine for $40
I drilled a hole, added a horizontal metal shaft into the pole, and jacked the pole up with a car jack.
So the hole needs to be wet for the shaft to be ease. hmmm, sounds familiar. Got it! thx!
not yet I'm going to do my girlfriend's brakes in her car first then I'll be over
Why didn't you just put on a bikini and ask any male driving by your house if he could help you with something?
Yep. Push it in further and further...
that totaly deserves a foot massage🦶🦶🥵
Awesome
She's hosing it, wiggle the pole, and got the cement out. Wow... I subscribed right away
She wasting a lot of water..
I could not believe that this will actually work .... dont want to be sounding patronising or feminist .... but this is an example of how women build elegant solution ..... proof look at other videos in youtube for the same solution mostly from men... overly complicated and massively crazy. .... i managed to remove 4 large steel retaining poles that was considerably hard just by filling up water into the pit as this lady suggested .... awesome work ... thanks for the tip
would this work on wooden fence posts
Question, does it work with clay soil and removing shrubs?
What IF concrete has been poured around the metal post?
3:56         <3
Came for the working chick dig
Are you single
Use one of these "tree root waterers to make it even easier: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P7M740 I just popped out two with this thing.
Excellent work!
Weren't you the lead singer of PussyCat Dolls singing "Dontcha"?
Why cant the best DIY quick videos be an ugly guy with one tooth...I have to watch the video 2x =)
Lote of comments here.  But I have to say  Your a very  beautiful and sexy lady !!!!
You go girl
I LUV U
this absolutely works! Thank you for showing this method! saved me lots of time and I was able to do this job by myself
Great tip!
You said you'll remove a CEMENTED post. Those were not cemented...
excellent demonstration......and the post removing tip as well
O have never seen such beautiful sight in my life. A gorgeous girl working hard.
Suggestion....next time make the video in a bikini....TIA
so how do u remove  them with 42” frost footings  i barley see any concrete on poles this must be hot weather only  i live in cold weather state :(
What a hottie! She can work on my fence anytime.
Very easy if you work the shovel and not let the shovel work you, but you are a tiny thing.
Okay you should do you're video's in a very sexy Bikini, you will  get millions of guys trying to pick you up
My kinda girl smart and thinks outside of the box :)
Hmm...that's weird to me. I've only ever seen these posts buried in cement. I'm from Chicago.
So does it work when you remove a stump from a hedge, when the soil is wet as well?
Wow. You're too much. Almost gave me a heart attack watching you and I mean that in a sweet, nice way. Great information too. Thank you. 🙏
That's what she said @3:15 into it. lol
Thanks 😊
this works on wood post too. thank you
Hi would it work the same to remove a clotheline pole?
Unmmmm.....What...What did she say?  What, what was this video about?
Not bad. I’m curious how well it works on wood posts with minimal cement. Floor jack method didn’t work too great for me.
Why so many dislikes? This was brilliant. I bet water can be used to remove many things. I have to replace my sidewalk, I may can use water on the sides.
Thanx now I just need to go out and do it 😜
Thanks for the video. If u r ever in Cyprus, u can help me take my concrete posts out.
nice video!  Looks like the fence behind ya is the one that needs to come out! :)
Yeah. Just push it in and itll loosen it up real quick.  :)   beautiful hot chick and a hard worker. WOW. I hope Your man worships you like he should
you are so Amazing and so cute thanks
I'll just tell my client no worries your water bill won't go up its only 20 poles +.
Very good work...  I hope you had some food ready for you after all that work... Nice video 😆
actually, i enjoyed you taking the post out the old fashion way.  it would have been a little more entertaining if you integrated some pole dance.
Nesrine bak hele (:::
she said cemenT right?
I have been doing it all wrong for years!  Water is an amazing force against concrete! Thank you!
Sexy
There's not enough hair flying around!
4:37 excuse me didn't quite catch that
thanks
Great job, although the proper work clothes are a bikini.
Most women wear flip flops while doing that type of work.
Right
That is a very smart way to have the post removed in such an easy and fast way.   Thanks for your sharing ideas.   Cheer, Hien Le
yes good job, o and i love you and i want to marry you and you can pull out my posts at my house and we can have lots of fun thanks.
Great tip. Beatiful woman
This a great idea. But how much was the water bill at the end of the month?
these posts were clearly NOT cemented in as she states in the beginning.  However her technique is a good one for posts that are simply installed with surrounding dirt.
I've done it the difficult way but that is such an AWESOME  and better way of doing that! Thank You Nassrin for Sharing! Excellent Video!
Good video and your one hard working girl 💯👍🏼😊
My wondering is who’s f...ing this woman...his a super lucky guy
love the pit, your cute too.  lol
That was hot
chain and handyman jack.. much easier..
Thanks for the good tip! That pole was tuff till you lube it up, but you couldn't stick the hose in all the way for a bit.
Nice job and you work hard!👍
I have the same phallus shaped hose nozzle
Got a boyfriend? Need another one? I'm great at mixing Kool-Aid and cleaning up. And I always have great ideas like you do! Come to Austin and we can go out for tapas.
Post goles diggers would made it easier and sledge hammer hitting post make vibration would crack concrete at bottom and be able to pull in no time
Saw it off and forget it
so much of cuteness doing hardcore job in day hot sun. sure you will be tanned 😢are not any men around there😡to help her pretty bad guys i wish i would have helped you😀
Watching this video on mute....I hear Beavis and Butthead giggling.
Going to try this thanks girl!!
You are making a muddy situation,  just use a Hi-Lift jack wit a choker chain, and enough common sense.,  Regards!
awesome idea good job!
Though you said it was cemented in?..if so water won't work.
hard labor in 90+degree heat and not an ounce of sweat.
Thank you, Nassrin. You saved me a lot of money.
Yeah I kind of like that first way better
No dogs were harmed in the making of this video.
You need some Balls !
New sub.  That was some great work. And your beautiful by the way:)
All the posts I need to pull are buried in 18” of concrete.
My hats off to you. Most women now a day's won't get their hands dirty and do that kind of work. You single? And, where are you located?
No concrete under there.     I bet u took a shower for every post
Thank you for this.  It saved me a world of pain :)
handiman jack--but be careful
You are cool
Are you taking down Trump’s wall?
She knows how to remove " things" with Water!....:-)
25min... it took me 3 hours to get mine loosened up with cement but the wooden 4x4 was broken off so I had no way to get leverage.. nightmare. This was like trying to deliver a baby
I always use water to soften the soil. I prefer using my brain than my back
what a happy dog
I was hoping for a wet t-shirt ending
Great video😉.  I know some guys who don't work as hard. I came across your video looking for how to get my chainlink gate from sagging without using an unsightly cable.
use a car jack with a chain takes two minutes
nice u
Cement comes out easy nice trick
Are you saying there were fence posts in this video?
Nice, pretty darn smart way to take post out .
Nice work Nassrin, your one smart cookie.
3:19 I would love to put in further and further in😁gigitty gigitty
Awesome info thank you ma’am   👊🏽 Trump 2020 Victoria,tx
How does water break up the concrete??????    Any help.
I think you're doing it wrong. Apparently without much effort, the attractive women I know have theae things done for them for free. Ooh..the water bill thing too.
I came to watch u. 😉😉😉
U my friend just made a new fan 😎😎
Nassrin... Please consider starting a diy home improvement series. The actual fact that you really know what you are talking about and doing makes a perfect pitch for HGTV. It doesn't hurt that ypu are drop dead gorgeous either! Love... Your loyal fan, John Hernandez.
those posts are shallow. try that in an cold climate where the posts are cemented 3 ft deep on clay.
My  heart was racing watching u work so hard lol
Reminded me of digging a hole for a post with your shop vacuum. +1
Ok, I admit, I thought this was too good to be true, so must be fake, especially give the pretty girl in skimpy clothes... seemed like it was a load of crap trolling for point with a pretty face.  But since I had the stuff for this, and didn't want to go buy a jack and chain, and since no one in the comments called BS, I gave it a shot. Much to my surprise, it worked exactly like in the video! I and my son were amazed!
Beauty and brains! Thank you - I will definitely remember this!
From the fence in the background........this must be in San Antonio....... they need to learn how to build a proper fence, use deck screws for starters and not nails.
the fastest way to remove that is to let me come over and do it and we can work something else out
Interesting and sure works but not in all ground types and i didn't see any cement
Why are you removing the posts? You should be fixing the fence behind you. The neighbors kids are peeking at you
These poles look like they are only about buried about 2feet. In my area the need to be buried at least 4 ft because of the frost level so they are much harder to get out.
You cheated! It was that shirt that gave you the leverage. I bet you can’t do that with a bikini top on!
i like when you say " pushing it in "  OMG  i love it .
Maybe if you wet the ground it will be easier
Today I pulled a lot of poles this way quickly without any equipment. Thanks everuthing works as on video). Like you  and style).
My post has a hell more concrete around the pole and this is pretty messy.
Push it in further n further and it will loosen up. I used this method and it worked. Made work fast n easy
Now that’s a great woman
Your So Hot
you are like me, only smarter
wHAT WAS THAT VIDEO ABOUT??????????
I’m sorry, I was looking at your body the whole time....
Smart girl!  Thanks.
Next time when you work outside please put on bikini  please !  Just saying !
Sweetheart, I love looking at you and watching you, but don't you have a vehicle. or any straps.
First you need a lot of water pressure which isn’t everywhere then you need sandy soil.  Don’t think this would work at 50% of the places because of clay soil or rocky ground or low water pressure to get that sucker out.
so, I have been doing mine with a post hole digger. It is WAY faster than pick and shovel but this may be even better yet! I'm gonna try it.
Oh my goodness am I glad I came across this!!
Ohhh...amazing...
Faster, but not exactly the best environmentally friendly method.
I use a tractor and scoop. No sweat at all.
Good video.👍work smarter not harder.
OMG!  This method does work exactly as Nassrin demonstrated!!   Thank you!!
farm jack ...shorter vid...
Thanks, worked great.
This is how the Germans emplaced big sloping piles on the French beaches ..... they adopted it to save time. Water forced into the sand to liquefy it.
I think that depends on the type of dirt?  On clay dirt around my house that doesn’t work.
Small girl she look like 6 ft!
And you didn't get dirty?  Also, in SE Louisiana, that is how some people install dock pilings.
Hydraulic or "Placer" mining is illegal in some states ! ! !
ah nope.  use a 3000 psi pressure washer.  will do what you just did on 10% the time.  also works for digging up sprinkler pipes without damaging them.
Or you can go rent a lever type jack and a chain from Home Depot for a few bucks and jack the posts up like we did back on the farm.  It take just a few seconds to do it this way.  The jack handle leverage is your friend.
lol
N)
was very helpful and it didnt hurt watching you do it.
The neighbours might not appreciate you trashing their garden
ok
Nice and wet... Nice!!
Try an angle grinder and cut the pole at the bottom.
Just use a tractor jack. I came out in 1m15s
Well nice ass
use a farmall jack and jack it out with a chain wrapped around the post,, drill a hole thru it with a bolt if u need to
Just way to many sexual inappropriate references that come to mind, just from her talking. I could've swore she said semen at 4:39. Gotta love it.
What I learned: Pretty much anything goes so much faster and is so much more enjoyable when physically fit and wearing tight fitting clothes.
Yep... Just keep pushing it in..... GOT IT!!
You aren't kidding!  Thanks for the tip...https://www.instagram.com/p/BvXyFixAo8-/
Nice. On the constructive criticism side, I would recommend wearing a white tank instead of the black one. A bra is optional of course. And for dramatic impact, having mud and water splash up onto your chest would add to the entertaining nature of your presentation. No criticism necessary for the content, so the only helpful thing that could be added would be to ramp up the eye candy value. Great job.
Sorry wasn’t focused on the reason for the vid 🤣🤣🤣
Its a good work out on the first , the easy water jet cool ingénues idea , i would probably have knocked off the surface and in 2 mins cut off with angle grinder cutting disk below the surface .
Thanks Beautiful!
Does that work with concrete???
She gets to the point from about 3:00 onward. Rest of it is all gender signals and ham acting.
Good work using an old method still relevant today. I wonder though where is is the concrete around the posts? They appeared to be in dirt.
I'll bet that her husband / boyfriend would come over and kick your ass if you dare made a suggestive inappropriate comment. Never mind...SHE would, with a fence pole. Nice tip!
Next time let's see one come out with 60 pounds of concrete hanging off it.
How does the water break up the cement because she did say in cement
i often spend my time the way you do now) but you are higher level tyan me)))
The nozzle is pushed in "farther & farther," not  "further & further."  "Further" Versus "Farther" The quick tip is to use “farther” for physical distance and “further” for metaphorical, or figurative, distance. It's easy to remember because “farther” has the word “far” in it, and “far” obviously relates to physical distance. No, I'm not an English teacher!
That's hot
Great idea. I have 900 acres of fence post that need to be removed. I'll get my wife right on it!
Great personality too!
Beautiful dog! :) awwwwwwwwwwww... Nurse...chef...tiler...and now...pole dancer! The sky is the limit  :)
That's what she said!!! Haha I love the videos, just having a little fun.
Why didn't you just put on a bikini and then go ask your neighbor for help?
Wait 4:37....."got that semen out"..???????
If you clamp a car jack/post jack to it, it comes out even faster with your water hose. But your a smart and resourceful girl good job figuring that out on your own.
Why dont you tie your hair up? You work like a man!
You got my heart racing too!
Nice pit bull
I got a dog that would dig that post out in about 10 mins... :))
All I can say about your video... GREAT legs! :-)
I have no idea how this video came up recommended but I’m glad it did. Estoy enamorado🥰
Great job young lady, sharp work out!
Why are there seamen in the holes, shouldn't they be on boats?  Good job though on the posts.
Just move house. Easy.
🤗😘👍
Oh  work🤗girl
I need several post that needs to be moved. That is the part that had me putting it off for years
Smart gal, big hunk of cement!
hi lift jack and a chain... no digging or water needed
All the best
EASIEST way is to hire a Mexican: fast,  inexpensive and done properly.
Why do Americans use those weird shovels with no handle they are useless
I think you are Irania!
I have a 4 x 4 post, I've been trying to remove .... now I know how to do it easily !
thank you! I have a ton of chain link to remove from the front yard and this will be really helpful. It's always reassuring to see other girls killing it!
It may be quicker but here in Brisbane Australia we have water metres at front of every house and are charged by the litre as it may be quicker to do it that it's cheaper the old way, in fact i haven't seen a sprinkler used in years unless it's in Parks owned by the council whom I assume don't charge themselves for any water used, but I think you have a good idea,
Just take a saws all in cut them off
Lol...cemented in? Where's the cement?
😍👍🏼😘
smart cookie
When using free labor attitude is important. The electric company made a friend of mine quit tying his dog to the utility pole. The same dog had pulled up a clothes line pole made from 6 inch pipe anchored in concrete.  The chain was starting to cut through the utility pole.  You can use a car or truck to pull the posts out.  Just wrap at the base of the post and pass the chain up over a short pipe about three feet long leaned up against the post to be pulled. Attach the other end to your car truck or tractor.  The short pipe will rotate when you pull the chain and the post will pop up right out of the ground.  No water needed.
this is interesting because I sold and installed miles of fence and never saw posts like this. The concrete is supposed to be 3 feet deep, code, and most of the poles she pulled out did not have any concrete. The only posts that would look like this would be ones that were pounded in to a gravel base, pounded into dirt, or installed with a small amount of concrete mix. There is no way you could do this with a correctly installed concrete reinforced post. That's what post pullers are for.
Your to pretty to be pulling fence post , but you look good doing it.  Just sayn
More pathetic, city people information.   I’ve jacked many of these posts out in 30 seconds.
Is this video about fence post or something else lol !!
She said her heart was racing, oddly enough mine is to and all I'm doing is watching her.
Ok try this one: Get a root watering wand and do the same thing. Uses way less water and is really fast.
In Texas we have what we call day laborers. They need money, you need labor. It’s a good system that has worked well for thousands of years. It’s even better than a water hose. An honest days work for a fair wage. Everyone wins.
Great vídeo, but at 04:39 that’s not the way to pronounce “CEment” 😂
Thank you very much, Fabulous idea!!
I've never done it, but I hear you can put the hose inside of the pipe, with an o-ring or some type of swelling gasket, and run it into the ground really deep. Same principle but in reverse?
I am so sorry that I'm about to write this but it sounded like you said "got that semen out" at 4:38 while I was drinking water and I spit it all out lol I had to watch it again to see if I heard correctly and it sounded the same lol anywho great videos just subscribed last night watched your tile video in the bathroom great job!!!
Great video.. this is a method I use however the post I normally remove has rotten and/or been bent/damaged and has 18-24 inches of concrete. I do run across some easy ones... I’ll watch a few more of your videos... thanks for sharing
So Nassrin tell us what that method is called.
Watching that digging effort made me realize what it would be like hiking 10 miles through the wilderness wearing a rented tuxedo and trying not to get it dirty.
Take off the cap and pressure the water down the pipe.
hit post on side a few times around bottom. pull post out, leaves cement, fill 2 inch hole!
This video changed my life. I am glad I am learning these tips prior to becoming an homeowner. Great job as always. Keep up the good work.
Hi Nassrin, you made a good video and easy to watch, well illustrated, in focus and with clear instructions.  What you are doing is well established.  It's called hydraulic mining, and is used by large companies to wash tons of ore dirt so it can easily be hauled away.    This was an excellent demonstration of how the City water pressure, can by used to dig up roots and fence posts.
You look like you're in Southern California! hire some of the illness Eagle Mexicans that are coming into that part of the country they work for pennies on the dollar!!
Were those actually in cement?
what ar you thinking about putting down now. since those ugly poles are gone.
dude i love watching your videos
What's the difference between an opinion and being judgemental
Love it.
Awesome  work. your pretty handy around the house I see .    I will  do this to remove my poles . thank you.  can't wait to see more of you.
I don't think they were cemented in that well. Probably just a base of cement. Wrap a chain around it and pull it out with a jack-all
Use a highlift jack and a chain to remove them.
Hot bod.
You said after 25 minutes lucky the clouds came out because it was hot, it took me less than than to see how HOT you are, SECONDS... :)
Watch out for the ground collapsing around your hose.
Are you for hire?  😈😏
Try a pressure washer
Good information from where
Gd idia
I think I can smell something some kind of good right now.
I was searching for a quick way to remove posts but after watching her I forgot all about my problems
Let me tell you a similar story.  I was walking down the street one day, going to the bank to deposit a large sum of cash.  When I saw a woman not quite as beautiful as the one here in the video trying to take out some poles as here.  She saw me and said " hey, big guy what you doing?"  I told her and she started crying about how hard taking the poles out were.  I said here hold my wallet and don't let the cash fall out.  I started to work on the poles and after awhile it was really, really hard.  Finally,  as the sun was going down, I finished.  I turned to find the beautiful woman and she was nowhere to be found.  I knocked on the house door and an older couple told me they were the only ones who lived there.  I wish that I had known about this quicker method at that time,  The beautiful woman probably would not have got bored and left.  Just think we could be married today.
If she would give me a little attention, I'd pull all them post out pronto !!!!!   I mean, I'm just saying......
Yes a jack a piece of chain two 2 foot 4x4s wrap it around and start jacking dummy.🤙☘️ hit me up and I’ll show you the way to work smart and not hard .
I like using car jack to lift it..
Sawzall with metal blade or grinder takes ten seconds lol. ;)
small girl hahahaha nice video
I love it!! Beauty, brains and bronze. Nice work.
How do tou take out wood pole with concrete. Ha ha
Far easier in skimpy shorts and vest.
You dig like a girl.
estas fuerte pancha,le voy a mostrar este vid a mi hija tal vez asi entendera algo sobre trabajo fisicoo y no simplement ejercicio to pump muscles up
Great job!  A rude person would have suggested you to use the hose to wet your shirt then swing around the poles.  You would have had guys lining up to help you out.  But that would be a rude person.  Again, great job!
I would destroy her...
A pole, a few feet of rope, and some blocks of wood or concrete, are all that's needed to make a simple lever that will virtually pull the posts from the ground with one hand. Sometimes the removal of the most stubborn posts requires shaking them as it's pulled upwards by the lever.
i must try this on my next job thanks for the tip :0)
She’s cute.
damn your fine. I didn't understand what the video was about
Who’s here to only watch her ? 😂😂
Smart and beautiful what a great woman you are 😘😘😘💋🤷🏾‍♂️👌🏾
Or take a vertical car jack and a chain
Bet your neighbors heart is racing now
Another great video! Awesome dog too!
There got to be a better way. She's working her ass off
At first, i thought they werent "see-meanted" in but then you pulled one out with concrete on it. Got a few fenceposts to remove great video :)
Lol. . She's fucking adorable with her narrations. .  😊🤣🤗 You've gained a like and a NEW SUBSCRIBER . .nice channel stay Audacious and keep them videos coming 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😍😍😍😍😍
Just a little advice if you don't mind.  You should always wear safety glasses and steel toe boots when doing work like this. It's gonna hurt when you find out the hard way like hitting your foot with the pick ax or dropping concrete on your toes.
After wetting the ground, rolling around in the mud helps. Give it a try and post the video. Please.
My akin back.
You should always wear safety glasses when working like this.
I love your videos you're beautiful I would watch you clean tools and not get bored
Next time just call me I'll take them out for you
Nassrina's DIY.... When u say u got it...u sure do girl....👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Ok i am glad i watched this and you both are beautiful and love the pup !!!!
That was a cool tip ✌🏻👍😀
My way , I usually dig around the post 10 inches, then I wait for a good rain. It comes out in 2 minutes. But your way works too.
Cheers. I will need to reschedule my wife’s weekend.
It's fun to watch a girl shovel - it's so out of character!   Avoid the mud:  a good handy-man jack and length of chain lifts the posts out easier.   Removing  the concrete base is going to require more ideas.  Good video for guys anyways.  :)
Good video Nassrin those old chain link fence post can be buggers to get out, but you figured it out. Plus you watered your yard .
Are u married  I could use a woman like u.
Using a car jack, I could do it in about 30 seconds
Great job!! Also ,if you attach something ( 2x4, etc ) to the post and use a vehicle jack, it comes out quick
You can set post the same way. just fyi.
I could watch this girl work all day....
Fine as fuck , excuse my language but damn girl
Not bad.. good job
Try a post and a come along
Would have been easier if you had a bikini on . Just saying!!
If you have a tractor it's way easier. Wrap a chain around the post & use the lift. Works everytime with no effort.
i prefer a chain, a tire and some sort of vehicle to pull it. by the time you soaked the ground around the pole i could have already yanked it out. now if your backyard is fenced in to where you cannot drive close to the pole the soaking method might be worth a go.
Just cut them off
I could not care less about those fence posts!   😘
I'm g going to try this on a bunch of cut off popular trees between two houses that they had cut down to ground level bases are right on ground level pretty big trying to figure out different solutions to get all that mass and stumps out. Going to give this a shot this weekend worried about flooding the two houses as are only about 10 feet apart
tattoos are for convicts and negros
I love work! I could watch you do it all day!  Try using a hi lift jack and a chain
She did not mention anything but I read her mind. Step number 1, how to remove a post of a blonde way? Step number 2, How to remove a post of brunette way?
How about using a pressure washer instead of the garden hose.
My friend Karl Von Stubel says that you are not real, you're a "Full Animation" created in a studio, indistinguishable from a real person except for your breast dimensions and strange preferences such as a "Pit Bull" and a "Skull/Death Shirt".  Is Karl correct?
not only do you get those posts out but you also get to water your lawn at the same time...
You are gorgeous.  Please do not get any tattoos, please.  They never make anyone look better.  They just put people into a lower class and make it more difficult to earn a living.
Awesome video! Brilliant idea. Keep them coming... Thanks, Jerry 😀👍
honey but where's the cement
babe I think I wuv you
I love a woman with dirty knees
I would like to take her out she is hot!
How much water did you use. Cut off below ground and fill in the hole, and call it a day !
So let me get this right.... The more you push it in the looser it gets ??..
try using an angle grinder, much easeir
3:18
You wanna keep pushing it in further and further it’s loosening up I can feel it !!!
back to back to back "that's what she said jokes"!
First time viewer, liked the pooch! Thank you.
LMAO
where's the concrete
I dont give a dam about the post nice body  i can come and help u
So sexy
4:38 .... excuse me?
All that water but everybody here still thirsty
Great idea.  I really enjoyed watching you instead.  Great body, can I come and help you next time.
Well here's a mystery. She said the post was held in with cement, (she actually meant concrete as cement on its own would just crumble) and spent forever digging around it. Finally it's loose and she pulls it out, but only the post! How could she pull out the post and leave the concrete, without breaking up the concrete to release the post? On the second post, had it been in concrete that hose would of done jack shit. I think originally the posts were driven into the ground and any cretin would of realised while the ground was baked hard they would of been difficult to remove.  Let's soak the ground to soften it!  DOH who would of thought it!!!!
You can do almost the same thing with stumps. Loosen the dirt with water, dig a ring around the stump. Fence or building in the way don't even bother digging that side, just use a post hole digger to make a deep hole somewhere with fewer roots. Use the hose to wash dirt from around the stump into the hole. Clean out the hole when full, then wash more dirt into it. Repeat as long as needed. Did this with a 30 - 40 year old bougainvillea stump two weeks ago. Took about an hour. Didn't even get tired.
so you take your hose... and keep pushing it in, further and further... what did she say  "..  It's loosening up already, I can feel it.." and to think of all those times I just dug deeper and deeper,10, 15, 20 minutes..... Ok Post #2.... she pulled it out.. just what did she say ? get got the 'what' out ?  Nassrin, you are beautiful and this is actually a fun and educational video.   Glad I stopped by.
Easiest and fastest??? Get a man
NOT set in concrete.
Those posts are not cemented in. That was fence post concrete that rarely holds because it has so little cement in the mix. Try you trick with posts that are set in 18 to 24 inches of concrete that is all the way to the bottom.
Yeah, but it was way more fun to watch when you did it the hard way.
Im trying this on Saturday, I hope it works. I was going to get a bobcat from work.
So what's the rush?
That fence post is a stick, what about removing a proper broken post with concrete attached.
they didnt look cemented in to me ,, but they are out non the less ,,,
I never saw any fence post.
Haha you have never done it a right way... use a three foot jack with a chain takes 30 seconds and no wasting water....
It must be her American accent. I thought she kept saying semen, when she really meant cement.
Para limpiar el culo sirve a misma técnica.
Cement is still in ground.you not finished.
Attach a bumper jack from the junkyard and jack them out.
That's a great idea. I never though of that.
Car jack and a clove hitch.  1 min
4:38😍
I would of gotten a chain from the back of my truck wrapped around the pole and pulled it out of the ground and not even broken a sweat
i have used the same idea in reverse to plant posts.  Attach a piece of pipe to the hose and let the water drill the hole, then pack some dirt in and ur done
Use a muffler clamp about 12" up and an old school bumper jack. You'll have the post out in less than a minute. Works on concreted posts, too.
10 mins of digging and you barely removed the grass 😂😂
This is easier https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2bnEJk5guI ... :) But you have done a nice job ma'm and you keep yourself clean too. :)
Gostei da dica, super simples Grande abraço 🇧🇷
You are a keeper
Beauty, brain, and brawn...will you marry me?
Great idea and video! Thanks for sharing!
The hose is great! 👍👍👍👍 you're brilliant and beautiful. .
Not easy and didn't look cemented in.
Put your dog away and I come help you
Almost spit out my coffee at 4:36, thought i heard her say, "Got that semen out!"
Keep pushing it in further and further its loosening up,,,,,,, they all do pmsl did she realise what she said
You said the post was cemented in. I don't see any cement on that post you pulled out.
I have two big suggestions for you.   1. With water. Buy a deep root watering rod. They are cheap. They are meant to water trees at the roots. Some have a thing for fertilizer. It looks like a tee and at the bottom it has five holes/jets. You can stick it deeper and go around the post. The jets will blast the dirt around the post way better and use up less water.  2. Buy a high lift/off road/farm jack. Put a small chain with a slip hook. Wrap the chain to the pipe and pull up and against the pipe then jack it up till it holds with friction. With the posts you had it would have only taken you 2 min each post and no digging.
Is that hours or minutes?
Does it work for wooden posts too?
4:38 thats what she said😰
Worked like a charm on 7 cemented in posts. Thanks!
I'm going to try this soon on some aluminum fence posts! Thanks!!
Thanks for the tip! This worked great.
try that 500 feet from your house! lol
Nice work do you have a Instagram ? Mine is Photocash.me send me a quick message when u see this comment keep up th good work
You rock girl as usual!!
Nassrin you make me happy.
I like how she handles the poles
What about posts with ciment !
I like the little squeak sound at 1:20
very pro video work. someone knows their way around Adobe After Effects
Was skeptical at first, but when the concrete came up too 😧👊🏾💪🏾
Damm she gets down putting in work good chick and she's  hot
GLAD i watched that. i am taking out 20 post this weekend. i was just gonna cut the cemented ones and pound them below the ground level.. that is even easier.
great job
Koolest Chic ever
CAN I HELP YOU, AFTER MY FAP, ¶:V
That was a great video.  Keep it up.
Great Job Nassrin always enjoy your Vids :)
Great technique.  Thanks for sharing. You could also incorporate a big pipe clamp / post clamp positioned about 18 inches up so that you could put an 8-10 foot long 2x4 under it to pry up and pull the post out with leverage.
That is a hard job for a woman. You are strong.👍👍👍👍👍😉😉😉
Beauty with sharp brain and obviously supergirl... I like you working different job with perfection & by your own way.. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
You are so smart, skilled and pretty, I bet 50 contractors just said omg why didn't I think of that. You can get my post out anytime :)  cool dog too !!
without splash , good job nassrin ! love looking your videos and want to take a drink with you near your deck chair..
I'm going to use this method on a tree stump in my back yard that I need to dig out, thanks Naz!
Hi beautiful lady.
You're absolutely beautiful girl! Subscribed
So hot
3:18 then 4:38
Hi Nassrin. My name is a Borat. I would like to meet you and make romance inside you. If you agree be my wife then you will come my country, I will give you television with remote control, a red dress, two strong shoes, I will love you and care for you, we will be as one... but if u cheat on me I will crush you!
That's a great idea! I'm going to use it. I once came across a post with a blob of concrete as big as a beach ball! Not exaggerating. It took 45 minutes for 3 men to get it out of the ground. We had a hose right there lol
Famous looks so cute!! Handsome boy you have there. 😊 🐕🐶 Great job on removing those old fence posts.  The wooden fence behind you looks like it needs some help.
That's a awesome trick. Great job Ness
Can i help you👍
I love u nasrin
It is great to learn something new everyday!!
You very professional
All that mess and didn't even got dirty. That's skill
3:56 I thought you were gnna pull some pole tricks for a bit there 😅😂🤣
Marry me
Need a helper, I’m free for you 😊
Poles,tight shirt,short shorts..... love the it
As usual...I'm impressed....😀👍
I have mirror tiles in my bathroom 12x12 how would you go about taking them off safely?
Nassrin you did a great job I would have never thought to use the water with the hose trick. Take care sweetie
Perfect! thank you!
Great work
What did she just say is on the fence poles?
Oh my God who is this? Are you the woman of my life?
From Iraq I love you
4:38 how did u know? Can u see me? Lol love the videos!
jesus
you can always tie the post to the chassis of your car and FLOOR IT!
Saludos a mi princesa del trabajo duro. Un abrazo desde carcas Venezuela
