My motivation, I WAN TO BE LIKE ARNOLD 💪
2025 anyone ?
Whe else likes the esthetics of the "classic" body more than the "massive mass" form of the 90's-2000's?
Arnie had the most beautiful muscles in the world❤
209 is retarded bro
2:37
quick question how many meals should have per day to gain muscles
I like to join beautiful world ,,,,,,,, that is,,,,,,❤️❤️(*(bodibuilding (*(❤
You didn't deserve to win in 1980, Arnold aka "Screw your freedom!" B
When he says chin up, does he mean pull up?
Noticed they was barefoot
When you do things with passion things turn out good and always have a vision truer words have never speen spoken
You know what's funny is everybody keeps telling me that I'm over training Arnold didn't understand what overtraining was so he was like f*** that okay so you're tired so what ultimately it's worth it in the long run of course I still let my muscles recover of course I still sleep what are you nuts I just do whatever I can each day even if it's two reps three reps whatever max weight perfect form slow return for hypertrophy trust me it works then still do your normal free workouts a week that are intense as far as sleep and diet everybody's going to vary like  Arnold says just sleep a little faster
Timestamp that save it needs to go viral!
Of course he was always smiling in the gym because he was the weider Brothers poster boy! 🤣 When you have free supplements and an income you can spend 5 hours in the gym. 😂😂
I started lifting weights around the age of 17.  I lifted for years.  I started lifting weights so people would leave me alone, so people would fear me and that way I could avoid confrontation and fighting.  I'm 45 and I'm not huge, I haven't lifted in ten years, but people leave me alone and I'm not bothered or bullied.
The craziest thing about muscle composition is that I'm 6'5" 275 lbs (lots of fat) and Arnold was 6'2" 240 lbs (lots of muscle) but he looks SO MUCH BIGGER than me.

if you're scrolling and feel off, read this. i was burnt out, low energy, not myself. found Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks, had zero expectations but man. chapter by chapter it rebuilt me. no hype bs, not fake motivation just stuff that grounds you and resets your system. this book really saved me. wish I found it sooner.🔥
I felt so drained and tired everday. I tried everything, preworkouts, youtube gurus, morning routines that nearly killed me. none of it hit. then i saw someone mention Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in the comments and it literally changed my life. Following everything in that book past couple of weeks made me realize I was running on empty for YEARS. wish I knew about this years ago🔥
Tried all the hacks. ice baths, preworkouts, even dopamine detoxes. none of it clicked. I felt so tired everyday. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a comment and I checked it out. been locked in ever since. no hype, just clarity. wild how long I was running on fumes.🔥
If you’ve been wondering why you’re not feeling as strong, motivated, or sharp as you used to, Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks might just have the answers. The book focuses on the power of testosterone and how increasing it can seriously transform your health and mindset. If you’re tired of feeling drained or out of balance, this book offers some solid advice on how to get back to your peak
not gonna lie, i felt numb for months. like i was just surviving, not really living. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a yt comment and i gave it a shot. bro… this book gave me my edge back. not by yelling at me to hustle, but by showing me how to fix my foundation. life hits different now.
With subtitle: 11:08 Super selling everything. Super selling super selling, SUPER SAIYAN
You really only need 4 hours of sleep if your between 20 and 30  And work out you sleep better and  have more energy when you work out
Frank sure did push his buttons I remember reading about him when I was younger in my early 20s working out

“The body doesn’t respond to the same thing over and over”
Everyone pay close attention!!   When this man talks, his words are all wisdom!
MAYBE COZ ARNALD S, HAD WAY BETTER DRUGS THEN THOSE WHO LOOKED LIKE SHIT. DRUGS AND TRAINING IS EVERYTHING.
Zgadzam się Z Arnoldem

Arnold Schwarzenegger is best bodybuilder of all time ♥️❤
Police academy is run by a bunch of pansies who just talk about reaching senior citizen status and it’s a protected class. Glad I was kicked out for “bad hair”- they are to busy being victims.

Top 3 Bicep peaks on stage after Arnold:  3rd one "Place your bets and Jacksons in here", then 2nd will be: "Ronnie Coleman" without zero or any doubts. and das 1st was is  the Unreal shoulder monstrosity from Germany known as "Markus RUHL".

"... So I do bench and then I do chin-ups and that of course lead to more muscle separation because I'm making things up as I go along and I have no science to back this up in fact if you think about it it really makes no sense but since I don't know what I'm talking about I'm going to say these things..."
What are these new supplements that work, Arnold. Oh please do tell us. The guy must have investments in supplement companies
He forgot "..every pill that I took, every needle I injected..."
I can't stand this liberal overrated blow-hard. Such a disrespectful person. He needs to just exit the scene.
He literally spoke better when he was younger. How can a man that can accomplish so much not get a better grasp of the English language after living here over half a century
Pump it up...Pump it up....Never stop....just Pump it up...Pump it up
after seen this video you understand the meaning and the origin of his success, great man before all

12:12 Strongly agreed ❤ 14:20 🔥
Arnold made the mind his bitch.
He was a legend with his housemaid.
Really like how he talks about not letting feeling down or from my understanding letting personal life affect your attitude your attitude on life really a smart down to earth guy
Arnold is really a knowledgeable and greatest bodybuilder of all time
Please let me know if medical intervention is needed
☺☺☺☺☺🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑📸📸📸📸📸
If your goal is to have a perfect body, you have to go in forever!
Very Nice
Very INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUAL……. STAY SAFE MY FRIEND.
Never been shown, rofl. Everyone know this Scenes.
Best aesthetic of all time.
Arnold is into sodomizing the poor
might sound weird but i see similarities in bodys of arnold and bruce lee
Most popular not sure about the best. I still think lee Haney was the greatest ever.
8:10 Arnie always had a mouthpiece lmao
Some of us never had the luxury to eat anything we had to eat what we where given so food was never much of a concern I eat for a purpose not taste. Not saying I don't have a weakness for ice cream.

Legend !!
He was swole 💪  and im trying to get swole 💪 like Arnold.!
This is the best motivation I have ever heard, Arnold is truly a hero, I am very grateful to him 👍
Откуда кадры тренировок?
I love his physique💪👍❤
Texting at the gym “Mikey mouse stuff” 😂😂😂 so funny….what about instagram stories?! This generation gets a big F- from Arnold
Your boy said y’all didn’t do cardio
Stimme 100 Prozent zu. Nur gab's das schon zu hauf 2010 ohne! Muckibude. Da spritzen se sich Testo und Beta Carotin für ne straffe Muskulatur und einen strammen Max 😅 und um eine bessere Farbe zu bekommen.
Wennschon, dennschon 💪
Arnold even to this day is still the stick every other bodybuilder is measured by
Wonderful there is so much footage of him! He's legendary xx
Clone secrets he was born girl hmmm,
Rip Van Winkle: I slept 20 years. Arnold: I just sleep faster.
Man look at those Bicep peaks. Amazing.
a lot of people are missing a key piece of information here. PEDs help A LOT with motivation. you go harder, stronger and faster when on drugs and normal guys just aren't gonna get those workouts
Lou Ferrigno looked better.
It’s more about being mentally tough than anything else.   Those who tap out on Naked and Afraid did not have the vision and mental toughness it takes to succeed.
Which Body Part Did Arnold Choose To Be ? ... Il Be Sac ...  !+)  Love Yoo Arni !+)
Hmm...
Lou should of won it was fixed
No one works in anymore?
@8:07 What the Heck. How is that humanly possible?
SUPER SET!!! 💥💥🔫
Arnold > Ronnie. Ronnie's a good dude, and huge, but Arnold is the best.
Always arnold
Training partner 💪🏼
He was incredible tho NGL
Ronnie Coleman, Lee Haney, Jay Cutler and Phil Heath have entered the chat...
One of the most famous humanbeing on earth today Imagine if social media exists in 70s,80s and 90s!!!!
Old is gold man arnold is the Legend 💪🏻💪🏻🔥
What son of a Nazi said, "Screw your freedom."
Arnie is a bodybuilding god
Today's Body Builders Look Like they are either Pregnant or have a muscular beer gut. Disgusting 🤢
All it took was a man to tell him “you need to be 210lbs” to flip a switch in his mind to alter his career path that’s insane man’s unstoppable
Didn't know this guy was a body builder.i know him for his movies .he a really a good smart actor .
Sleep a little faster 😂
spot on with comment about texting in gyms - too many doing this nowadays and hogging equipment - denying others the opportunity yo use it.
it is time too slay this pectus
Really people were texting in the 80s in the gym ...that's what's goin on now ..I really see old things come back that's y they say the arlond way is the best stop following fake ass workouts on YouTube
Let's be real everyone back in them days was really serious about working out... these days is very different.. lazy people..on the phone no focus... just goin to the gym to hangout taking up machines that real people wanna use
Everything is doable but when u r YOUNG and HEALTHY
I love arnold.
If he didnt take breaks he would have 15 Olympias
I know it's the best you've ever seen.
фигура вандам намного лучше шварцнеги и красивие
"I need 8 hours of sleep" "Just sleep a little faster." That's inspiring
Arnold swarzzennagger will always be number one in bodybuilding
Who works out for 5 hours a day
He got that popeye bicep
I’m chronically ill, was diagnosed with a softball sized tumor in my left chest at 20. Spent the years from 20-37 going (intermittently) through chemo to shrink it.   I watch these videos with envy. I would like to know what it is to have a healthy body I could use. To build. To feel youthful and healthy. To not constantly have to view and treat as an enemy. This is all so foreign to me.   I would give anything….ANYTHING….to just be healthy. Perhaps in another life.
arnold is not only the goat but also the father of bro science
Imagine this guy playing Reacher
That shot of Arnold and the other body builders eating at the table is so freakin cool. Its like looking at He Man and the Masters of the Universe just hangin out.
A absolutely love Arnold Schwarzenegger. His bodybuilding, his movies and respect his flavor of politics. He has a charisma that is so warm and catching.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👽
They look like shit...🤣🤣 genetics is biggest part of it all.. cant change some genetics no matter how hard you train
Arnold could eat my sea men
👍

Best bodybuilding video you can watch on internet !
Screw your freedom.
If Michelangelo's David wanted to see the the best sculptor in the world, he would have to travel into the future and see this man's body!!
every time i need some gym motivation, i go to an Arnold video. pumps me up more than 10 energy drinks at once
Classic>open
it doesnt matter what it is youre doing you have to be doing it out of conviction, motivational tricks dont work if youre not motivated you just dont know what you really wanna do yet or you need you need to better understand your inner self first before hoping to accomplish some big goal. goals that you keep are never fanciful ones based on delusion its the ones you already know you must and will stick to before forming any clear idea of how.
It's bittersweet because I have none of any of this.  I have no goal, no vision.  What do you do when that end point, the thing to visualize, just doesn't exist?  You drift, right?  But I *have* nothing else.
My muscles hurt just watching this video..
Anyone know who the dude with the mustache is that arnold’s seen lifting with in these older videos?
Before i was into bodybuilding, i thought Arnold was extremely overrated. But now that i am bodybuilding, i understand why he is everyone's favorite.
Visualization works for everything!!! Try it
He is so f*** smart
I was feeling anxious and just wanted the words of the Lord of Bodybuilding...
Only Arnold ca wear a watch that big and not look ridiculous.
The best all time
Happy New year
Sometimes I forget how far I’ve come… I’m 205 pounds. I used to be 130. I’m gonna go far in this field I can’t wait
When Arnold schwarzenegger talks About bodybuilding,              🔥🔥🔥Everyone should listen.🔥🔥🔥
First time I’ve seen this video.   Awesome, and Arnold is so correct.  Time is a HUGE HUGE factor in everyone’s life.  So many excuses are used because of time.   He’s very right with there are 24 hours in a day…(sleep, work, life, etc.).    Today’s schedules are probably very different compared to the 70’s ( seems like )….. HOWEVER, there’s still 24 hours in a day…. Sit down and make a draft like schedule for a day, and try it out….  There will be tweaks in it I’m sure.   Buy a yearly planner ( I do ), and jot down what needs to be done ( pay bills, make calls , sleep, work, etc… ).  Give everything a round-about time limit.   Like I said earlier, there will be tweaks in your schedule.   It may take alittle time to get a good descent schedule…..keep working on it  There is “ always time “…. Even if it’s for  5-minutes a day ( 7-days week x 5 minutes = 35-minutes a week)… better than 0 minutes…..  My problem, is I procrastinate too much !   When I don’t, I do get everything done and it makes me feel good.  I know WE can all do this !   The human mind  decides our choices in life.  It’s easier sometimes to say I don’t have the time…. I know I do .   Arnold is right though with this video.  That’s why he became greatest bodybuilder of his time.  His body wasn’t all  to bulky, and just all around perfect.   Nowadays, the bodybuilders are too big / bulky( my opinion)….  Anyway, this video is a very good motivator for many.   Makes you think about life.  Is there something you want to accomplish ( lifting weights, run a marathon, swim, etc..)?  Let’s all work on it then ( including me as well) Like Nike says:   “ Just Do It “ !  ( powerful words)….
Arnold knows success
„Wenn schon denn schon“ da packt Arnie aus 😅
He won't shut the **** up and let Arnold answer the question
Makes no sense….. how do you gain muscle and not EAT?!!!?!!?!
Arnorld. Bruce Lee, Franco were one of the the best in the world, well also Lou Ferigno and Frank Zane.
Aside from how great a bodybuilder and incredible an icon Arnold is, I thought it was really interesting seeing Arnold talk btw 7:50 and 8:50 in this video, both today and from the past. It was like seeing 2 different people. Just a reminder of how we all change, sometimes more than we think throughout our lives. Or how he really is a gifted actor. I saw 2 COMPLETELY different people in this video.
This is so fucking good
Can't stand him
Balloon man
What exercise did Arnold do at 3:13 ?
Yup gonna Bench 140kg tomorrow!
That chick there in the gym is drunk on hunk!
"It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable"   - Socrates  Arnold really exemplified this.
One name: Mike Mentzer.
Song 1:10??
I really love seeing the love in his eyes when he is posing. He truly enjoyed and loved what he did.
Sleep faster brahs

GOAT of bodybuilding - Arnold Schwarzenegger!
5 hours a day 😅
Arnold "screw your freedom" Schwarzenegger
he had an amazing body
I workout because it makes me feel good and improves my confidence the aesthetical changes are a bonus but they are not the main driving force behind my reasons to work out.
Sergio Olivia, not this immigration phoney baloney bisexual
Mr. universe, famous actor, governor of a state. What a career this man had. Most people can’t obtain one of the three. Much respect
What made him the best looking bodybuilder! was his 6'2 stature with muscles.
Legend of bodybuilding!
💪
What are you afraid off!😮
count ups, super count ups and mega count ups.  if you know you know.
Arnol  is awesome 😎
Okay, I know nothing, I know. But, imagine what Arnold would look like today in 2022 with the nutrition and science that we have now in the sport of body building. For me, Jay Cutler is "The Man" But, Arnold was wonderful!
Funny they never mention the stacks they used
Lejend
Greatest of all time
with stereoids you get that big, you dont get that big by training every day for 2 hours for 10 years without stereoids
Inspired so much
"It's getting closer and closer, to incredible satisfaction." I say that to myself after every single rep.
This should be the baseline, taught in all school, these principles can be applied everywhere in life. Including learning and the brain shocking the brain muscle with new modes of thought.  I mean I would've loved training had I been shown the thought process behind it. And expectation as a result of it. I would've been really motivated to push it further myself.
He dropped down to 210 to play Conan… the movie that started it all
You got to look inside the muscle!
Арнольд как всегда Занощевый Самовлюблённый лгун. Всегда лгал своим - типа Друзьям. Д. Вейден въебал в Арнольда всё своё состояние о сюда и корни - Единственный неповторимый .. Были Лучше спортсмены. Серж Нубре.. Оливе даже не допустили до Олимпии - лишь бы Арнольд выйграл ушедшего Лари Скота
Only hard training &food
Hes funny, i Like
My goal is to workout to Impress girls
Arnold was just the perfect all in one package in his time ..  The correct body, his personality and attitude not just in th gym but in life and the determination to make it to the top at any cost .. he managed it exemplary 24/7  @ 365
Without anabolics, you would be nothing. Thousands of guys aged 13 to 20 train hard in the gym, but do not want to take anabolics. Because of this, they can only achieve modest results that are given to them by nature.
👍💪💪💪💪
Arnold was one of the Best mr.olympia
"Wenn schon, denn schon!" 😄🔥
5:19 About those temporary joys: well, it's so in our whole life. If You are doing something, then go all out. Or go home... :)
How was he able to do that rowing movements without hurting his back, it's incredibile to me. And i think that extreme movements helped him a lot to create that perfect body. Such a legend
👏👏👏👏
Shut up and lift weights you pussies!
Having Joe Weider all over your nuts don't hurt either !
2:44 what's she saying?
Arnold..what kind of food is recommended  after gym work out...most commonly  recommended as  best diet ever
He embodied nothing but spread the use of PED to compete. He screwed up Ca as a governor. Total bad influence
I frocking love Arnold Schwarzenegger
I prefer Dorian Yates over Arnold every day of the week
Arnold is my inspiration in bodybuilding.
لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله
Und jetzt erzähl uns mal was von Anabolika... 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Before I go work out (lift) I watch videos like this one and I suffer from muscl wasting and other health issue I still workout doctors don't know how I do it how I want it
HERMOSURA ¿'´++
Arnold made bodybuilding popular.  He had one of the best complete physiques, proportion and symmetry was fantastic, and his personality and charisma was great for the sport.  Definitely one of my heroes.
F your freedom to compete in this beautiful country you prick.
totally blew my mind. this is no bodybuilding. this is golden life advice.
Different breed
A F)"""N LIAR! EVERYTHING HE SAYS IS BULLSH"T! DON'T LISTEN TO HIM! HE WOULD HAVE NEVER WON A SINGLE MR.OLYMPIA IF HE,WASNT FAVORITE OF THE WEIDER BROTHERS HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE 1 SANDOW AT MOST...TYPICAL POLITICIAN!
you are a swashbuckling site
9:05 sounds like Planet Fitness
the best of the world, for ever
that back... fingers all over it!!!
people nowadays are mad at you if you grunt or scream but look at the state of that gym at 11:40 , the machine doesnt even have pads, or 12:14 where he has no shoes, and the noises in there when they are dropping the weights...that's just insane
Ar-nold was great for his day but much like other sports, today's bodybuilders are better than his era. Arnold wouldn't even qualify for Mr. Olympia today. Monsters like Jay and Ronnie elevated bodybuilding to surreal levels.
I don’t think the president or the pope works out arnie lol
Hormones are a miracle😂😂😂
To me Arnold is by far the best body builder of all time. Others have won more, or were bigger, but Arnold was the best. Period!!! The perfect symmetry
Many times hats off you dear sir.
To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion. And may peace and calmness fill your life.
He is overrated. All he had was height and genetics in his advantage. And of course the Name
As with anyone that is great at anything, their mind is just better than everyone else’s.
he is not the best bodybuilder of all time he is the best bodybuilding actor of all time
The key to losing body fat and getting ripped is: You have to be hungrier to get ripped than you are hungry for food.

The Austrian Oak they called him.
No doubt about it, a very focused individual.
13:02 most helpful advice
Guys my question is a bit weird but can someone tell me what's the name of the text font in min 4:29 please
He’s talking about motivation, as I’m drinking a jack and coke 😂😂😂
When his time is up he will be missed,!
Arnie is a good lookin guy !=(best bicep peeks etc.)ABOVE average genes who took up the right hobby and used things 2 make  himself even better ,2 be more successful!
You don't have to be a body builder to take on the principles he teaches here.
I have pulled off running 3 miles after training but before training? I wouldnt  be able to lift 135 for 5 reps
He was great until Black's took over bodybuilding. Now arnold is looked at as just so-so.
His peak physique is still the best, and now it would just be copied. He had the best proportions, best mass, he earned his success 100%. A legend! 💪
Great video and Table of Contents.
We all love Arnold schwarzenegger, not just because he is the best bodybuilder of all time, but because of his mentality! 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Think of what he accomplished. You can disagree with his politics, whatever, but can you name a greater success story??  Humble beginnings in Austria, begins competing in bodybuilding, comes to America where he found more opportunity than was ever possible anywhere else, seized that opportunity by the horns, became the greatest, most famous, bodybuilder of all time, then gets into movies and becomes one of the biggest names in Hollywood and an international action movie superstar, then gets into politics and becomes governor of California, and made a fortune along the way.
Did spooky just call him a "dumb-bill"?
Arnold SheWasANigger! The best body builder ever!
Great workout program and most importantly effective

Best Arnold Schwarzenegger motivational weightlifting video on YouTube!
Hard work always beats talent
One of the greatest athletes all time. I love watching and listening to him.  The  inspired the terminator movie ;) this guy just kills
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍
2:34 XD
The most muscular pose are the lit ❤️
His physique was so beautiful like he had been sculpted by the gods !! ⚡
Arnold had a great upper body but his legs were too thin i believe...
Many People think he is just Muscles , but he is more mind and mindset , absolute legend 🔥
🔥
Mich würde sehr viel mehr interessieren wie der Umgang mit Wachstumshormonen gerade zu seiner Zeit verlief alles andere ist nur augenwischerrei und rumgeeier für die Leihen Welt
als würde Mann bloss mit disziplinierten Training und richtiger Ernährung so ne Optik erziehlen,will seine Trainings Disziplin nicht schmälern,jedoch reden wir doch offen über die Stoff Kuren welche Mann braucht um solche Erfolge zu erzielen dieses ganze Gelaber
Plaplapla mich würde mehr die Stoff Kur dieser Zeit interessieren, dieses ganze Gelaber als würde Mann bloss
He never cheats on his diet,  just on his wife. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Me: i need 8 hrs of sleep Arnold: you need 6  Me: are you sure Arnold: just sleep a little faster
Motivator in all fields that he is engaged in and he became the most successful person in all fields that he is extraordinary
'Screw your freedom!' - Arnold Schwarzenegger
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s father was a nazi . Oh and “screw you’re freedom.” -son of a Nazi
Excellent video.
My original goal and vision was to wear a Superman costume and look good for comic con but my goal evolved after covid began to wanting to be healthy and strong. I know I want to get from 280 lbs of mostly fat to 200 lbs of lean mass

I love Arnolds sense of humor in those old video clips.
No hate but best bodybuilder is Dorian Yates.
Your Body was achieved
absolutely astonished to find out he only slept 6 hours
awesome video!!!
Most people don't come to America to play games. Peep how he in that MF barefoot!
So we're still not acknowledging the gear huh?
If u need to train like the Terminator endoskeleton Cybernetick Orangnizm We can duel
the Pope is a real animal
arnold trained so fuckin hard .an they didnt use insulin an that shit like dorian an them ,they dont even look like they were bodybiulders i mean dorian looks like he never lifted a wieght ,bodybiulding for life not to just get rich an stop.
I have a vision, I want to be like T 800. I'm kidding, I just want to be stronger.
The best athlete all the time .
what is the movie name of this video?
He said if the President has time to work out, if the Pope has time to work out then YOU have time to workout.. 🤦‍♂️😆💪🏼💪🏼
2:44 That’s pure desire right there
This man's body was really a work of art.
how worldclass you are when in 2 days with your mouth you invent 10 movies like i for you 86
🔝🥇
Arnold talks pure shit. And knows nothing about bodybuilding fact. Hes just a drug dealer
12:06 completely blew my mind! What he is describing is one very important aspect of qi gong training! To put the mind 100% concentrated on the body part your are working on. When you have confluence with Arold Schwarzenegger's training and a more than 4000 hundreds years old training method, you know it's a very important point! Thank you Arnold!
The key to any success, is having vision...

1:26        good life advice:    you must have a vision, a goal. Take your time, and find motivation, a reason to motivate you
Arnold is Definitely one of my Heroes.
Arnold Great! But the MYTH.!
The greatest of all times.
Sleep faster. Love that! Everybody was big and yet very human. I think today's push towards the mass monster is...too much. I am 57, so maybe I am old-fashioned. I think I am pretty liberal and when I was young, people around me thought that Arnold was too big and they didn't like the freaky cephalic vein in his arm - but I was good with it - but now I am freaked out by the bodybuilders of today. And by the amount of drugs they are taking. Way too much; it has been corrupted and dark.
People now say don’t swing your weight but Arnold swings the weight. Is he wrong
This is why he became the best. Good job. 👍
Super sets FOR THE WIN !!!

yes
His form on a lot of stuff was awful.
"Do you drink milk".............Arnold's reply... "I drink beer, milk is for girls."
Until he said screw your freedoms now he's fughing........  BENEDICT ARNOLD  SCREW YOU ARNOLD!
Best physique in history.
💎
SCREW HIS FREEDOMS BENEDICT ARNOLD FUGH YOU
Guy: *stops watching v-tubers*   The guy 10 seconds later:
My daily dose for workout,just can't workout now without Arnold in my ears n mind
And may have is honest.and I wouldn't think if it and again God bless you and your family,and I'll tell you now too there was no disrespect from me I think however if you found one somewhere then maybe you may think to state it to me.with honesty.
Even tho people are cheats,cheating yourself of the truth is bad and it's wrong.i have that to you I think, and I understood the first time I herd,also you may do what you think is rite.i see these and I know I still think about this.yes the gym is very hard work.and etc.i wished the best in luck for the very most purposeful aspect for rite reason.cheating I hear.but as I understood,I think and I believe that with all things and if everything is good and not to have been in a position to forsake yourself and I know it's a strong word but it's honest and with honesty is nakedness too it is true.
"Don't tell me I have difficult time..." bla bla bla. Then, in 2021 "Screw your freedom"... what an idiot.
Wow after watching this I’ve come to a decision to stop working out and just get plastic surgery. Thanks Arnold.
I love this!
nice eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Godlike
One thing I dont like to have a lunch or dinner with body builders, they are so self conscious and always shows craving more meat and want to eat more than others like in a eating competition , grab all foods as if there was no food for months.  This guy is my body building model.
The best bodybuilding Arnold time
THIS IS WHY AMERICA IS AMERICA. YOU GET OUT WHAT YOU PUT IN. SOCIALISM WILL NEVER WORK HERE. AMERICA IS A COUNTRY FOR WINNERS. ANYONE CAN BE A WINNER BUT WINNING ISN'T WALKING TO YOUR MAILBOX AND OPENING UP A CHECK. MARK MY WORDS......LOSERS WILL NEVER DICATE WHAT WINNERS DO AND THAT;S  A FACT. ARNOLD IS THE PRODUCT OF AMERICA; A MAN WHO WAS FREE TO PURSUE HIS GOALS AND ACCOMPLISH THEM. SORRY JOE BUT YOU COULDNT CARRY ARNOLDS JOCKSTRAP BECAUSE YOU ARE A LOSER. IM GOING TO LAUGH WHEN JOE AND HIS TRASH MEET THE ARNOLD ARMY.......I WONT FEEL SORRY FOR YOU EITHER. YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU DESERVE.
The biggest takeaway for me and something I forget to do sometimes is the MIND-MUSCLE CONNECTION.  He said it's the most important thing and it's easy for me to get distracted.
11:00 cc: super saiyan
Planet fitness isn’t the same as this gym.  Sad.
Little did the people at muscle beach know they were watching their future governor working out.
always moteviruyus looking at old Arnie

SHOACH DA MASCLE
JUST LOVE THIS
These body builders physiques compared to the modern day... Old school was far better
he is  boat
Who know the song name at 0:40?
No body has thay shape until now. V taper thst goes until the waist. Chest that pop out but still shreded. Bicep peaks like a volcano. And legs that are proportional to look like a human with good genes. Not legs that you can not run with or let alone, walk normally.
His words are more than any teaching ,follow his words and you will become arnold of your area
Arnold has the best chest ever till this day i have not seen such a defined chest
Loving sleep

I am Famara Mendy A young African, Who likes Arnold Schwarzenegger, and many of  my friends called me Arnold, one day i will leave my  legacy so that i will be remembered, just like the best bodybuilder of all time.
Arnold is one of the most intelligent, inspirational, motivational bodybuilders ever. Salute!
Think about that 'TWICE' 👌
Striations on his chest are points.
Look at his striations and definition his chest is boxed in at the bottom.
This is the real Greek god physique

Get to da Choppa if you want your Freedom, ahh never mind, screw your Freedom.
2:41 what was she thinking
I was about to have my cheat day and now I feel so guilty lmao
get to the choppppaaaaaaa
If you hate The Arnold, just know he's way more successful than you'll ever be.
He’s not the best bodybuilder of all time though
This guy is a winner in life.
What is the best product or brand to lost lots of weight? I read lots of superb opinions on the internet about how exactly Okibetonic Secrets can help you lost crazy amounts of weight. Has anyone tried this popular fat burn diet plan?
Never heard of Ronnie Coleman I see
That girl looked at him and said " yes daddy " lol 😆
I could listen to this man talk about exercise forever.
I love how they went out to eat together
Arnold was one of the best bodybuilder
I haven't been in the muscle ..I will now.     Changing mode.    Thank u mrs Olympia
So amazing, I need to sleep faster
Every legacy is different but every legacy can be great ,keep on 🙏

Great Arnold 👍❤💯🙏🏼🙏🏼

When bodybuilding was beautiful... now its the swimwear catagory that is the most aesthetically pleasing. Now days the big guys look like monsters, veey impressive but just doeent look the same they looked like sculptures back in arnies day...
“People I work out with don’t have the motivation. They look bored working out and dont focus on the muscles.”  *Muscle lives matter*
Praise the lord
Arnold ain't shit
*JESUS CHRIST IS LORD AND HE IS COMING SOON , PREPARE YOUR HOUSE AND REMEMBER THAT HE DIED FOR YOU TO SAY GOODBYE TO SIN !*
If all the People Were Like Arnold..........Mars was Already Colonized.
He is right! God bless Arnold and his Family!
Arnold's mind is like iron
@0:57 Austrian Egg =)
This video is definitely wonderful! It helps me remember of the time when my wife used Okibetonic Secrets to get rid of 18 pounds and enjoy being healthy again! Most of us wish to lose fat, however we also need to remain nutritious, which is what Okibetonic Secrets gifted.
I read loads of superb reviews on the internet about how exactly Okibetonic Secrets (search on google) can assist you lost a lot of weight. Has anyone tried this popular weight loss system?
My idle. I’ve watched him, I’ve read him, the greatest of all time in my opinion. Others have tried but, have not come close.
Wow
You are a legend
My 3 day split is: Day 1:chest and back  Day 2:legs and abs Day 3:shoulders, bis and tris
It’s been a while since I’ve gotten serious at the gym and this popped up on my feed. I’ve only been going for a month ever since lockdown started and watching this video reminded me that I need to work harder to surpass my friends and everyone
Arnold : he is mr universe at 28 years me While me : still looking for a job a 28 years old
2 months in. I turn 43 this year. My why is to be able to say at 43 I’m in the best shape of my life. Also I’m big on visualization myself. In my my I picture bodies I’d like to have and focus on obtaining it
Arnold is a legend period Not just one of the best bodybuilders in history, but also a smart and wise man
Arnold was perfect
He's not the best he just happened to be better than the competition of his day. There is nobody in the last 30 yrs. he could beat. Today his legs would be graded too small for his upper body mass. 32" waist have been passe.
My dream is to be a champion in bodybuilding and be remembered in fighting, wrestling and acting be another Arnold and Franco. To have all these bodybuilders around me people screaming and be the most ripped mass monster like jay cutler and Dorian Yates. That’s a big goal I get excited when I have to lift all this weight and do the reps because each set lifts me closer to my goal. You can do it you can do it you can be the greatest! Arnold wanted to be another reg park I want to be another Artie and Franco rip. You can build your own physique and legacy and have many victories and be remembered. Someday it will be Josh Peterson blueprint to cut and mass. Any of you guys can do it too whether it be bodybuilding the movies business whatever.
0:52 What did he say?
Arnold escaped from the barracks to participate in a bodybuilding competition when he was serving in the Austrian army at the age of 18 and went to Germany by train and became the first! Of course, he was detained for 3 nights after returning.
Every bodybuilder's Inspiration  Is Arnold sir
я бы  не  сказал  что Арни в годах довольно силен и в форме просто прекрасной.
Arnold was the best bodybuilder
6 hours sleep? enjoy the dementia arnold
Could listen to him all day about gym and motivation
The past wool arthroscopically wish because push angiographically request next a wiggly cook. lethal, colorful coast

before going to the gym, I am watching this video XD
They forgot to ask what kind of cycle he runs. All this advice  is worthless without his cycle stack
The fine tie overwhelmingly land because cast comprehensively afford amid a nosy pantry. sneaky, wicked date
Best ever video Arnold is the best
The even excellent excited ophthalmologist primarily concentrate because richard probably wander excluding a stupendous drug. clammy, overwrought muscle
Blach bla bla . Good gear, good genetics and life focused on training from young age . Nothing impresive to grow that meat :D Proper gymnastics skills are much more impresive than bodybuilders.
I  love watching Bodybuilder bro and from new Zealand 🇳🇿 💪😁and I love it bro 😁👍
I like Arnie too but what he doesn’t tell you is that 95% of the people just don’t have the genetics to build a body like he had whatever they eat or train. Even the drugs react different, some will have great benefits others get fat or don’t have sufficient results.
I love seeing the difference in working out and dieting from when Arnold was younger (80s) vs NOW.
Damn the bicep is like a softball 1:00 😳🤯
Arnold started to become a shell of a man when he became intimidated and overshadowed by Trump. His deranged comments and TDS has forever made Arnold a laughing stock and ruined a once great legacy. Sad..
12:34 *but they look like shit*
best
0:46 Arnold is a Crip 🔷⁉️👍🏿
You have time to work out ! No excuse 🤠
I'm an animal if i only get 6h of sleep for more than one day
SUPER BODYBUILDING LEGENDS ON EARTH ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER 🤗💅🌸
he looks big in training than when he pose.. he prolly doesnt eat
Can’t even say enough about this bloke !! Just a legend !!!
anyone else noticed?  Arnold used suicide grip for benchpress
Why motivate myself by looking at bodybuilders when these videos motivate me
One of Arnold's greatest successes is that he and Franco Columbo are still best friends.
He has a nice watch 😀
He really said they didnt have all the supplements back in the day to get shredded as if nobody knows about the bigges supplements of them all LMAO
How can a bodybuilder eat like hell but can still keep in shape?
'Never before seen footage...'.   AKA Arnold is smart and bought all his content years ago for a rainy day.  Great movie - I've watched it a few times now.
He was a funny man 🤣🤣
Sleep a little faster
Arnold is an extraordinary person . Such a funny,  dedicated, and talented individual.
ARNOLD back then Looks like A greek God.👑
Hercules
Not human
Met him ..after comps look pretty normal when no cycle
They had riods etc then but less  amount
How many dudeds training around him still alive?
Got a pump just watching this!
12:12
Yep everytime, It was a mistake watching this on sleep time
Best bodybuilder at the time. Dorian Yates is better by a large margin
I started 2 weeks ago and I find my motivation by trying to be the best me that i can. I don’t want to look back and tell myself i should’ve went to the gym. It’s never too late to start. If you wait more that’s more time wasted to be the best you.
My goal is to look muscular, In the beach
Me curling my elastic band in front of my bathroom mirror before I go to sleep cuz Arnold said they will grow in your sleep 😴💪🏼😤💪🏼 Respect to the Real 🐐
The two pedestrian univariately blink because stepmother tribally reject off a married aftermath. charming,  freezing begonia

He is always my motivation
I have set my deadline: Jan 2022.   My goal is to bench press 4x my age. I turn 60 next Jan, 240 bench for 3 clean reps. I am at 190 now...I know I can do it.
30 sets a body part? Mans gotta sleep 15 hours a day to recover from that shit😂
during pandemic i shock da muscle with isolation cuuuurls
I've just had a vorkaout
Arnie..such a driven focused athlete.  Hard work ethic paid off.
He is not only THE legendary sportsman but also a great entrepreneur✊ He built himself as a great product largely desired by people and he's always delivered his product's promise.👏👏👏
A great motiviation.
Wish I had a bench in my room I would get Arnold's chest lol jkjk
His chest looks bullet proof 👀
No compititor is never ever in the world arnold always legendary leave the legacy❤️💯🔥 🦁 no one train like him💪
"Aghh!!!! Kill me now......do it" -Dutch
I’ve always looked better doing cutting without changing my diet at all but just doing more. My body looks better and I end up performing better on cardio aswell while maintaining healthy weight.
Living legend.

Ronnie Coleman might disagree with the title😆
Wish the gyms where open 5 months off training sucks lockdown.

I remember watching this when I first starting working out. Ffs lmao

He used great form ?
You have been trained and tricked into drinking alcohol since you were 17.  Alcohol is a toxic drug, poisonous, and cancerous. No celebs drink or barely do, even though they may trick you into drinking.  Alcohol is good for business profits, government taxes and the medical profession as it makes people sick. 100s die everyday due to alcohol, 1000s are disabled with pancreatitis, liver/heart disease which is not reported!  Alcohol controls population numbers.  Watch out for drs prescription toxic drugs too, see a functional medicine dr or naturopath instead to get better
I'm interested
Arnold was the best of his day. Ronnie Coleman is the GOAT.
Thanks legend! This is all I need these days.
Arny is funny he just stoped ped's and got the role😂😂😂😂😂fucking liar🤣🤣🤣
Hey There! Thanks for this useful video. By the way, I notice a lot of people keep on talking about Custokebon Secrets (do a search on google), but I'm not sure if it's good. Have you tried Custokebon Secrets? I've heard many incredible things about it and my mate lost a lot of weight with it, but she refuses to tell me :(
I read many people keep on speaking about Custokebon Secrets. But Im not sure if it is good. Have you ever tried using this popular weight loss secrets?
Don't be a girly man
Arnold sportsnigga
The GOAT 🔥
Arnold would be a great fitness trainer
It’s always the point of view that separates the perspective: for one it’s pure Motivation for the other it’s addiction ... we appreciate what these pros achieve but on the otherside they sacrifice so much to reach their goals... you Need a special mindset to be happy with that
Here is my blue print: Monday:chest, shoulders and triceps, abs Thursday: legs and calves Friday: back and biceps, forearms, abs
Arnold was and will always be the Michael Jordan of BodyBuilding
If Arnold was born in the united states, he would've been president if he wanted.
„When the president has time to workout than you have the time.“ Trump: henlo
Just realized that he always did his workouts barefooted. Is this a good advice or bad?
im scared to spot this guy, he lift a hundred lbs
lou tho.... just saying.
Arnold's type of physique would draw more people to the Olympia and overall sport of bodybuilding today. Disagree??
I have time to workout I just can’t get a job

What a load of TESTOSTERONE
100% u.s.d Approved!!!
Арни здоровье тебе.
Mikey Mouse stuff. OR you train or don't. Nice comment.. I am glad. 12:55 . Many people texting and training over 20 years still looking crap. and i train 1.6 years and i was competing at 98kg. 0 text. all out like he said.
Who else bowed their heads a bit and mumbled "Yes Mr. Schwarzenegger" in shame as they watched this video
Come with me if you want to live...
Hitler went all out, you gotta give him that

What caught me was his comment , "sleep a lil bit faster "  - LIFE is for the LIVING  WE DIE CAUSE WE DONT KNOW HOW TO LIVE  YOU READY TO LEARN ?

The obese criminal mechanistically gather because fibre precisely smoke amongst a ambitious daisy. momentous, gray greasy great anger
sylvester stallone!
That biceps is legendary.
Most compelling and life changing quote I have ever heard from Arnold was this....  "All it takes is discipline."
That girl in the video was kinda interested in Arnold. wouldn't you say?
I can smell the testosterone through my screen
This was a very bad idea watching this on my rest day
2:43 That lustful stare.
I love ur hair style and body. Love u sir
1.5k dislikes = 1.5k beta males !!!
Arnold make every Set soooo CLEAN absolute insane..  look the Bodybuilder Mr.O Today..   The traning looks so ugly ...
8:11 HAHA :D
I wonder about that story about the director saying he'd cut Arnold from the movie if he didn't weigh in a 210. The number one bb'er in the world - who was he going to replace him with at the last minute?
9:30 wtf arnold surrounded by clones
Pierro...I was there. I had come from Greece. To watch the match. After the match I came and grabbed you by the throat and told you that you were the best. Although I had a lot of respect for Serge Nubret. We are out of the match hall. I was one of the greatest junior athletes in my country at the time. What did you remind me ..... memories ... We are children then ... What beautiful times ... We did not know then ... I wish you to be healthy and happy. You were one of the athletes I preferred.
9:50 having a training partner is a game changer. With all this corona crap I don't think I could have bothered setting up workouts everyday in garage on my own, happened only thanks to having a partner and we push each other every day.
Coo
Arnold can be compared to barry bonds, mark mcquire, etc. He could not have achieved such bulk along with muscularity without STERIODS. As far as him being smart - he was a rotten governor - he has demonstrated time and time again that he is an idiot in two languages.
The depressed rain renomegaly stir because slave curiosly curve circa a scary quotation. female fertile, swift stone
Legend ♥️
Is 6 hours really enough?
NOBODY Can ever match and beat  ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER HE LOOKS INCREDIBLE  PERFECT! NO ONE CAN EVER MATCH HIM..
The big message that I get out of this is that hard work pays off if you NEVER give up.
The best builds ever was Arnold man That v taper he has was sick Chest was massive  Shoulders so defined Massive arms   Classic bruh
Arnolds bicep at 8:12 is fucking crazy........ the definition and peak to that thing doesn't even look natural
Jeff cavaliere : how imitating arnold is killing your gains
@  the world in 2021
i like this vidéo but also i prefere another best video in this field @t
impressed 2:41
@ 2:44 that girl was CREEPIN and PEEPIN at ARNOLD lol!
I love super sets I am 16 year old
ALL TIME LEGEND OF BUILDING 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
pot-ner
Good video.
Dbz and Arnold are my motivation for everything .
"but if someone had the bread wit the hamburger patty, we will bust a nut on there."
One of the biggest reasons that Arnold won because of his height. It looks a lot more impressive to see a person that is taller that it is ripped than someone much shorter that is equally ripped because the taller person has to use way more range to finish one rep than the shorter person. The muscles are spread out further. Had he had more people of his size he might not have had as much success unless it came strictly down to drive and motivation.
this dude was successful at everything he touched, that's not by accident..he has a great mind  for success and what it takes
I always listen to Arnold's advices.
The Arnold sir mr.america 7 times
humility??????
Arnold will always be the king of bodybuilding. The rest are false kings & are Bitchy-Queens.
6:52 Can someone translate what Arnold says here?
13:26
I bought the mp protein at Cosco because it wasn’t super expensive and it had everything I needed until right now that I’m sitting on the toilet watching this I realize it’s his brand lol
ABSOLUTELY AWESOME KING ARNOLD 🎈🤗🏆
👑💪
The problem with training partners is that I can't find one. All my friends are out of shape people who don't want to go near a gym.
Why did you cheat whit drugs
On dirait qu'il a un petit zizi le schwarzy.... (sourire...).
2:40 thats one of the reasons why most of us train. pure motivation
I like how he speaks so highly of Franco🙂Friend goals!
Can some one tell me if superset like arnold is good? Or it's better push pull legs
14:05... typical immigrant. My Dad has a similar story.... he came to this country working and going to school 15-18 hours a day and became very successful. First generation Americans know how to seize the American dream.
No legs
Best bodybuilder of all time.
Perfection=}Arnold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Schwartzneggar
staying hungry ruined his BB gains. 1973 -74 were his best years
Those Physiques from the 70's are just more attractive then todays BB's.    BB back then was about, shape, proportion, aesthetics, definition, developing works of art.
Greatest ever bodybuilder Arnold.... a legend
The goat!!!
RIP Franco.
great motivator for this 75 year old  Thanks Arnold.
1:00 wtf bro that makes me so insecure
ঙ
Who is watching this and lifting
One of the best,Top 3 for sure but the title"Best/Greatest Bodybuilder of all time" belongs to Ronnie Coleman without a doubt.
Great Today I got my Goal for my health.Thank you so much.
watched this on my rest day and couldn’t help but do as many push ups and dips as possible. my gym is closed on sunday !!!!
My Inspiration
I spend about 5hrs a day watching YouTube. That’s dedication!
35 sets... jesus christ.  It really begs the question that, if 1 human can do 35 sets, why can't the rest of us?
He is the fuckin man.... And his housekeeper got all of him
LEIDER NICHT GEIL-WIEDER EXTREM DUMME IDIOTEN VOM SCHLAG 1772 VO DENEN--IHR HABT NICHT DIE MACHT-SONDERN WIR  90.742!!!!
13:25 Arnold:“everybody have a problem with time” Me: “ah shit..here we go again”
Arnold is in his 70's and still looking good. Shit i hope to even hit 60 lol
He looks like a "Greek god " !
one an only the arnold
Imagine a time when there were bleachers around the weight lifting cage and people would show up to watch you workout. Now we have people watching other people play video games. We done goofed.
Imagine the honor : three feet from u the god of body-building giving u advice.
Watching this while filling out my workout journal happy with my workout...  Arnold: I would do 30 sets on each body part   Me: I need to do a lot more
"Sleep faster!" I love that
mike mentzer is watching this right now
Is no one going to talk about the size of that knife compared to Arnold’s hand 10:03
Wenn scho, denn scho!
I am honored...to be Arnold. Imagine you do this, with your whole life.
I love Arnold’s theories he’s 💯% correct
That is the reason why a book “Muscles without tears”  is becoming popular.
I love to cheat on ma wife
now days He is old,fat and ugly.....vanity!!!
"i was taking classes from 8 til midnight"...lol, but you were always an awful actor, arnold. Great body, but awful acting; let's be honest, huh?
Simply put, make no excuses... period!
verry good
OMG U TERMANAITOR GUY WOW
can someone WRITE the german phrase? If you do something do it..?
Arnold  was a high volume trainer.
Most beautifull humble and best Bodybuliders of all time❤🦁
Me: And he was still able to have a kid with his maid.  Me to myself:  Soo you're telling me there's a chanccee
He is worlds greatest lifeter and motivational trainer
When he said "When the president of the United States has time to work out", then I just had to check when the video was from.
All time favorite 💋 Love from india ❤
He ran from prophet muscle.
2:43 She wanted it right there on the bench. Dripping wet! 🍑
8:37 he fucked his maid
Nobody is gonna talk about the life lessons he's been giving here?
What the intro song names?
I feel kind of gay for watching this
💯🐐💛
Check your phone all 3 minutes when you're in the gym but please not while sitting on the fucking bench. Too much of these annoying idiots in my gym..
If you go to a gym the few people not being on their phone all the time somehow see the fastest gains, go figure.
mistake to see this video in 01:00 night
Dude was a fucking beast.  There are dudes that are bigger today but, his fucking symmetry.
That young lady at 2:45 wants the pipe
Arnold Schwarzenegger is legend of all time greatest
GOAT
Hooooooge
Excellent beautiful amazing sublime inmortal El maestro Arnold Schwarzenegger.
What is Custokebon Secrets? We have noticed many awesome things about this popular lose weight diet plan.
I read loads of good reviews on the internet about how Custokebon Secrets (search on google) can assist you lost tons of weight. Has anyone tried this popular diet plan program?
The elements of the body  There are two main energies: spiritual energy and material energy. Spiritual energy is conscious and material energy is unconscious. The soul is conscious spiritual energy and the body is made up of unconscious material energy.  Without food, there would only be the self, the soul with a size of 0.1 nanometer with its shells.  According to the Sankhya philosophy, a person's body is composed of the following 24 elements:  (1-5) 5 mahābhūtas ("great elements" - earth, water, fire, air, ether / space), (6) manas (mind, mind, spirit), (7) buddhi (intelligence), (8) ahaṅkāra (ego), (9-13) 5 senses acquiring knowledge (indriya - sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch), (14-18) 5 working senses (karmendriya - legs, arms, anus, genital and speech organ), (19-23) 5 sensory objects (indriyārtha - shape / color, sound, taste, smell and touch), (24) avyakta (the unmanifest)  The five great elements, the ten senses and the five sense objects make up the gross body and manas, buddhi, and ahankāra make up the subtle body. Avyakta is the basis of both. In this connection of 24 elements sits the individual soul (jivātma) as an inhabitant of the body, accompanied by the paramātma, the oversoul . With soul and oversoul, the human being consists of 26 elements. Jivātma and paramātma are both referred to as kṣetra-jña ("knower of the field"). The body is kṣetra, the field of activity, and the soul is the knower of the field. But while the Oversoul knows all fields of all living beings, the individual soul does not even properly know its respective body. Through unthinkable long contact with the material energy, the spiritual souls have forgotten their original knowledge and identify with the body in which they are currently living. With the body they try to enjoy by manipulating material nature and exploiting the riches of material nature. These 24 elements are manifestations, transformations of the material energy and exist in and outside the body as constituents of the universe. Their development, properties and interactions are described in various Vedic scriptures and also in the Ayurveda classic Caraka-Samhita. Just as a potter makes a jug out of clay and water, the spiritual soul, under the influence of the three modes of appearance, sattva, rajas, tamas, unconsciously creates its respective body from the 24 material elements through its inclinations. In contrast to the potter, who knows how to make a certain object, most souls do not know how they made their bodies. They carry out certain actions with one body, cherish certain likes and dislikes, etc. and receive their next body from the Oversoul according to their karma  The three doṣas (bioenergies and bioelements), the seven dhātus (types of body tissue), the upadhātus (subsidiary body tissue) and the malas (waste products) contain the mahābhūtas in different proportions. The seven dhātus are:  rasa (lymph; plasma) rakta (blood) maṃsa (muscle tissue) medas (fat tissue) asthi (bone tissue) majja (bone marrow and nerve tissue) śukra (sperm and egg cells)  The upadhātus are tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, muscle fat, breast milk, menstrual blood and the six layers of skin. The body's breakdown products are feces, urine and sweat. Hair, fingernails and toenails, ear wax, and other secretions are also considered malas. The malas feces, urine and sweat, ear wax and other secretions need to be eliminated regularly. If they are not properly eliminated, disease will arise. ( From the signs and symptoms caused by the increase or decrease in doṣas, dhātus and malas, the doctor can determine which mahābhūtas are required to restore their equilibrium. Then he can prescribe certain foods and drugs (with corresponding mahābhūtas) to compensate for the deficits or excess of mahābhūtas in doṣas etc.)  Whether there are other energies and what these are all about can be found in the Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic scriptures,
A Legend training hard in his 70,s.
kard
I love bodybuilding so much :') If it wasn't for that I would be a skinny fat geek. Now I am a lean and muscular geek :D
Wenn schon, denn schon!
I've been lifting weights since I was 16. Just for fun and to look healthy. I followed the Joe Weider system and still have my original workout sheets. Dumbbells and barbells.  When Arnold came along he turned the bodybuilding world upside down.  I'm now working out harder, with Arnold's motivation. I want to and will enter a bodybuilding competition at age 65 and will continue in the lifestyle. I don't look or feel my age.  Joe weider and Arnold....my inspiration. My motivation. THANKS
Arnold says there were good weight gainers iin his time can any recommend?
Yang milih allah like 800 ya yang milih dajal abaikan saja
I'd love to see Trump do a workout
What happens NOW... everything is saggy???   a fucker of the married Mexican house cleaner to have an illegitimate son.. Now everyone looks him up like living God
A living legend. This is rare guys. Most legends are gone.
Arnold doing an Arnold impersonation @ 9:03
Pumping Iron Arnold Unseen Training Footage Scenes - 1:45 - 2:16 - 2:23 - 2:31 - 2:50 - 2:57 - 6:30 - 6:58 - 7:33 - 7:43 - 9:15 - 9:49 - 10:33 - 10:51 - 11:05 - 11:48 - 12:03 - 12:24
now imagine if Arnold was in the Gestapo uniform, knocking on the doors in the midnight and saying "u r terminated".
My first idol growing up. I am sharing Arnold now with my boys. Thank you Mr. Schwarzenegger!
Great Advice
I love this man what an inspiration.
I love how 90% of the viewers wanna be Arnold Schwarzenegger, but most likely will give up in the first year of dedicated training.
the best All Time  is Steve reeves--NO DOPING
Good feeling termerniter and predator tomacho
Dude it’s kinda scary how big he is
Today's bodybuilder are bigger, but they're not better.
Hard work with little cheat 😜
Arnold is amazing but honestly he isn't the greatest body builder of all time. Many guys in the 90's had much more amazing bodies than him and they didn't even win the Olympia. The mix of mass, proportion and extreme cutting was unmatched.
*DEBATABLE*
Ja wenn schon denn schon  ;)
What's the classical music at 1:07 please?
Now he has family pack
Say it slow....The Oak.
Arnold was obsessed. If he did something else people would have said he was mental but no.
actually i just test if my earphone work properly and no sound bleeding before go to hornpub but i stay till the end
Arnold for president anybody?
Body builders from that era had wayyy better builds than the bubble gut behemoths of today and Arnold was clearly the best.. most recognizable body in history of bodybuilding

Makes a vídeo talking about the life of arnold schwarzenegger  it must be rally cool
The coolest movie by arnold schwarzenegger for me was the extender of the future 1
Wow arnold schwarzenegger and very Strong when i grow up i want to be like him
cocky for a reason !! @8:12
what an inspiration
"Wenn schon denn schon"   Translation properly. If you do it, do it right.
This man is and was a very important person in my life.  A true inspirational person.
I am very sure that he never got bullied in his life😁
RIP Franco
"Thats Mickey Mouse stuff..." xD lmao
We love Arnold
"You train, or you don't train"
I'm 76. I went back to driving for 3 years for the money. Strength goes away fast. I'm  back now and specializing in bench 3 days a week. Biceps for 2. I feel everything coming back. Body building videos motivate me. In 24 years I'll be 100. I plan to use 80% of the weight I'm working with at that time and do lots of reps and GET REALLY RIPPED. That's my goal.
Intellectually oriented people can make fun of him all they want as long as they admit they want to be muscular/athletically build like him. That´s more fair.
7:02 i swear i thought it was a statue
Youve now encouraged me and im on holdiay in walrs with no weights
It’s soooo hard to achieve that body type
He got flatfoot???
Anold is a Statue that can move. His mind is great as his body. There should be a statue size of the planet Jupiter of him.
My buddy laughed when I told them I was gonna lose weight with just implementing Custokebon Secrets, but after I showed them great effects after I used it they are begging me to share with them about it. Of course I won't let them know the detail about this diet plan, lol
When Arnold wins mr Olympia, does he put pictures of himself on the wall for motivation?
The Austrian oak rules !!👏🤟🙌🤙😎👊💪
Can somebody explain to me why Arnold had to lose some weight to be in films? I thought the bigger he was the better he would look in the movies. I'm confused.
Sleep a little faster, the best thing in the world, how can you not love Arnold, yep need to train now!!!
Really inspiring
The best ! I’m so proud oof you !! Congratulations! You did it. You are the Winner!!!!💪💪💪💪💪👍👏👏👏
arnold said at the end something about a "perfect body" then someone off scene said "come to my house and you'll see one"  lool
When we enjoy what we do, it’s amazing ☺️
ARNOLD   OLYMPIA GOD then became " The Running Man " lol  running bodybuilder?  :) Conan  Terminator Predator  Governor  God
Arny YOU ARE A CHEAT BRO 😃😃
Arny s best man was a nazi🤔😒🙃🙃
"THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK?" POWERFUL POWERFUL WATCH YOU TUBE BY PROFESSOR WALTER VEITH FROM SOUTH AFRICA

Living legend
Esta mamadisimo
"they not serious.. this is mickey mouse stuff" LMAOOO
Those were the days my friends we thought they'd never end. But the dark side of this wonderful sport won. Poison.
He talking about a lot of you suckers who been training for years an still look like shit
💪👌👌👌👌
Everytime I watch this I go do pushups
love this
"Your goal could be...I want to impress girls. And if that's your goal, so be it because it motivates you." We know that's your real goal from the start Arnie Lol
I am still waiting for this Unseen footage...
Im 15 and workout 6 times a week since November.
9.08😂
The only man that could ever say he had a better back than Arnold is Ronnie Coleman!!!!
With a couple of exceptions yes. For the time yes, but that level has been surpassed many times since. Best bicep peak ever, he takes that.
Hmmm football player Arnold :D
He's the best
In germany we say: "wenn schon, denn schon"! Arnold you are a real legend
without a doubt !!
My sister
You get a pump just by watching this and flexing your muscles when you see arnold training. I am inspired!
What he's watch ?
that's what separates him from the rest, his mentality for success and work ethic. 14:26 is what I needed to hear. I'm a PhD student and a scientist and it's so easy to say I'm busy, which I am, but if you want it enough you will make time, not excuses. This man has a tough mindset, absolutely no excuses and no Micky Mouse bullshit (in his own words). That's admirable.
Better than Dorian Yates...Flex Wheeler? Not the best, but up there.  It's his charisma that's unmatched. .
I’m a 35 year woman and Arnold has been influencing me for a longgg time even tho i don’t LOOK like it. But I AM fit and strong. You know why? It’s because it’s his mentality and drive I LOVE and learned so much from. Thanks Arnold ✨💪❤️
"Got to be inside the muscle"
I mean imagine how shit it'd be if he never came to America or never got popular, and we never knew him. It's unimaginable. It's people like him, those extremely rare exceptionally talented people that really give life color.
2:42 she says "sounds like he's coming, hahaheheha"
You look at guys from then compared to now, huge difference, but what is it exactly? Maybe all the additional drugs, and training methods that guys use now days to involve every fiber of every muscle. Arnold's day while they worked very hard, they didn't exactly blast every conceivable angle and fiber like they do now. I think the body shapes we saw then and see now are largely a result of the different training methods. If a guy were to adopt a golden era routine strictly, he'd wind up w a similar shape.
Damn. Do you really listen or do you watch this and say, f*** it my life will pass by anyway? Schwarzenegger didn't get a chance to because he wanted something more. Nvrmind. U get it or u don't. Time to set goals and go for it for me.
4:55 that biceps
Real body builders with real bodies. Unlike the kind of disgusting freaks we have nowadays. This is the body i want to have.
Arnold is 70 80 or 90yrs
My buddy laughed when I told them I was going to become slimmer with just using Custokebon Secrets, but after I showed them amazing effects right after I used it they're begging me to tell them about it. Of course I won't tell them the details about this diet plan, haha
was he a natural bodybilder?
I have done this program. Its insanely hard.
It seems to me that there are a lot of haters out there now-a-days, but these films show how Great Arnold really was. I see guys questioning some of his Olympia wins, and rightly so, but he went against what was out there at the time. Its like saying a fighter isn't the best because he didn't face a Mike Tyson, no shit, but he beat everyone who was out there, with the equipment that they had back then, and whatever Nutrition and supplements they had back then, and I may be crazy, but he look unreal for that time, and he would still look GREAT today. Anyone who works out with weights would love to "ONLY" look as good as Arnold did back then, Today!  How UN- F-in-believeable  would Arnold be today, with today's equipment, Nutrition, and "supplements". I would put him up against anyone if he was living in these times as a young bodybuilder, and conversely I would put him against anyone who would ONLY use the equipment, Nutrition, and supplements that he had back then. That is the contest he should hold. Hold a bodybuilding contest where the participants can only train with 1970's style equipment, Nutrition, and supplements. There is a drug test, and they can test positive, but only for drugs that were available back then, and NO  OTHERS. NO drugs developed after 1975. Only drugs allowed are ones Arnold "Heard" of. Then they have to be in that regiment for 3 years. It wouldn't be sanctioned by the IFBB, who gives a shit. They're full of shit any way. Everyone would be on their honor, tested every month for the 3 years, then after 3 years, "its Show Time". After the first contest there would be able to be a contest every year. You can even get sports doctors signed up with it so they can monitor the contestants. If you want to compete in this contest in the future, you have to stay in the regiment of drugs, food, equipment .WE wouldn't give a shit how much of the drugs that were available back then that they do, just that they only do those ones. It would be the most FUN Contest, MOST Competitive contest, and liked contest. Regular people would be able to get in on it. It should be the last thing that Arnold does. He has the Arnold already, with the GH monsters with every one of them competing in their 9th month, This contest would have guys that look Good. They would look like comic book SuperHero bodies. Women's bodybuilding would come back with women who look more feminine.. We would have weight classes, because you would definitely need them. There would be NO GH, where a 5 foot 5 inch guy with the genetics of a accountant, but who was on GH  for 3 years, and is now as big and muscular as a guy with the genetics of a lumber jack and 6 foot 6 inches. I don't like the physics you see today.  Back in the Late 70's and 80's, guys weren't afraid of the drugs that were out there, because NO ONE had 28 inch arms, and a 52 inch waist, and competed in bodybuilding contest. NO  IGF - 1, so you always have to eat right. I would love to see this "sport" get back to being more healthy. NO  BUBBLE  GUTS. How the HELL do the fans of Bodybuilding put up with that shit. IT  WOULDS  NEVER  HAPPEN  in 1983. They would be laughed at. You would hear all the same shit about them at every contest, "Man the guy was HUGE, but he look like he was ready to POP!!"  Anyway, sorry about the length of the post. Its OK to Dream. Stay Blessed.

Before  go to the GYMMAA  Later on go to the choppa
2:40 That girl was really hungry :D
Arnold was a dumb ass lier, and if you see this believe it, cause more talking and bodybuilding hurts your body and mind, just go walking for a long distance once or twice a week if you born human or suffer from what you’re not, that means Nazi killer lier addicted moving machine
Soooo great!!! But remember that we all need at least 8 hours of sleep if we don´t wanna get strange illnesses like dementia, cancer and other stuff. We also will get better trainingresults. The more and harder we train the more sleep we need. But don´t listen to me. Check it out with the best scientists on sleep and why at least 8 hours of sleep each day is important for everyone nomatter what age (earlier they thought older people didn´t need as much sleep, but that they had to redefine). If you wanna stay healthy. Never cheat with your sleep. It is an investment so you can be more effective and healthy when you are awake. At least 8 hours every day.
Columbu just became my inspiration
2:45 caught her mirin
So is overtraining a myth?
The Mr. Olympia winners they come and go.  But one name is forever... Arnold Schwarzenegger
Ronnie Coleman: Am I a joke to you?
I flex like this in the reflection from my car
The perfect body, periodt.👌👌👌
coleman is #1 though
4:54 makes arnold look like a child
The greatest of all time bodybuilder no doubt beautiful looking now all looking like balloons missing old school
Simply the famous and the first one all the time.
If this guy decided to be an astronaut he would probably be the first man on Mars...I mean this man has inhuman mindset
what about time sitting in traffic? can't get that 1.5hr back it's wasted!
The legend bodybuilder Arnold 👍...you're not Ronnie... 🙄
Imagine Arnold's physique with today's supplements, and nutrition.  Someone should do a render of what that would look like !
8:12 was funny, really.
What that girl said??? 2:45
Arnold was shaped like a Greek god!! It is said that Zeus himself cried after seeing him
to receive none, give none.      if give subb consciously that not for, forgive.  if forgive difficult, forgive self.     if meet not planned, go separate ways -  if not then let peace take place.   drop all weapons, let peace and harmony take its place .  then overflow and all will have enough to eat everyday.     the betterment of choices for the greater good as whole for planet outweighs the choice for self.   nature is the strongest of all.   sun, moon, clouds, rain.

That guy was pretty big......I guess.
Imagine what Arnold would have looked like at 4-5% bodyfat
Arnold is literally Almighty from MHA
Laying in bed watching this at 2am. 15 min later I’m going ham on some push ups beside my bed. My gf wakes up and looks at me and says wtf r u doing? I’m like uh push ups. She’s like at 2am!?!?!? I showed her this video next thing I know she’s holding my feet while I do some sit ups. Smh Arnold is the GOAT hands down. Ronnie Coleman never got me out of bed at 2am
Best of all time is Jay Cutler
Please watch Frank Zane!  Just sayin!
Whoever wrote this needs to go to Specsavers he was the Best until Ronnie Coleman walked in the building
And that movie was Hercules goes bananas.. lol

13:35 « Well I’d say, just sleep a little faster! » that one killed me 😄
5 hour workout? ronnie coleman claimed he only did an hour and a half workout at his biggest (300+ lbs) arnold was a wimp. lol ronnie was one in a billion, genes-wise, but overall I think arnold's symmetry and aesthetics were second to none, ever.
I was a big Arnold  fan until I learned alot about him. He's a man of little character. It's one thing to cheat on your wife but to knock up your maid and make a fool of your wife in front of everyone?  Piece of shit!  He's still calling himself the greatest of all time. It's not true, if it ever was. If you judge by competiitions, he cheated and bribed his way into contests after deadlines when he saw a weak showing. I don't like it but it's true. It  sucks when your hero dissapoints so badly. As for his treatment of woman, only the Kennedy klan would condone it.
Adam burda bəlkədə qızıl xırdalayır. Tərcümə edində bunu😀
Damnnn his body is so perfect amazing !!!!!
if you wanna see one go to my house hhahahaha
Um...anyone interested in seeing a modern era Olympia champ or top ranking heavyweight guys run 6 or 8 miles?? LMAO
Watch my video
I know you've watched Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru. Here is the live action 7:15
woow clips from the pumping iron movie
Legend
He is far from the best ever...
Am inpras
Ronnie Coleman was Bigger and Better .
8:54 why is the black guy looking so mad :(
who cares if u have an accent or not if u have energy and strength like him, the world will make a way ; in whatever u wish to do.
We are making
You can say whatever you want but his physic will be the best of all time, you can see how hard he worked for his success!👍
As expert, I do think Custokebon Secrets is great way to lost lots of weight. Why don't you give it a shot? perhaps it is going to work for you too.
How do you go from casually working out to training
Iam 220 lbs fat got belly fat 😂 hope one day i got body like this legend because as a kid i got bullied because of my fat body going to show them whos is boss this man inspired me a lot
This is why I lift and why I started lifting. This man right here is and always will be my inspiration.
Oh the irony of me watching a vieo of arnie sayin"dont waste time"to waste time XD
1:17...woah! flatfooted?
what if im skinny fat, what should my goals be?
Sleep a little bit faster.
It was a mistake watching this on my rest day
This man tells u everything, all his secrets, yet no one have come close to him yet! RESPECT!
When Arnold quit, aesthetics quit.
Thanks Arnold for sharing your video awesome!
very good film:)
So inspiring, I could watch these videos all day long and never get bored of them 💪🏻
wow shock
I read his workout book. I,tried to read in detail, that no point would slip by me. Looking for something new to change my workout and make it better.  When i,did super sets, was the best results in the quickest way ever. I actually too those concepts and let them evolve into slmethi5even greater. Granted there were many different things I was doing to increase my gsinst. Though out of them all, this,was the most or close,to it most important.   Now days,when i,try to share that with people who think they are a big gym rat, know everything. They want to argue with me. Saying there is,not way,they,can makexot through their workout if I go to muscle failure in every set. No one can do that. You are crazy. You dont know what you are talking about.   Listen to Arnold , he was one of the best. And, when I read and listen to the greate after him, and watch them all workout, that is what they all are doing. They are all,doing that same approach in their own way. That is the same advice they all give. And, it works in an incredible manner.  I out my,ego aside. My ego was not part of the equation.  It was getting the best results I could was my goal. Many times people forget things like that and the biggest obstacle in their own way.
Thanks for sharing this Video 👍
What a mindset!!!!
The guy is a legend that word gets banded about but what he done was impressive his dedication passion love and hunger for what he desired his insatiable appetite to be the best .
Robbie Robinson is my favorite
What was that idiot thinking trying to drop kick the terminator ?!? Interesting to have you in s movie ?? The predator was my favourite
Ronnie is just a kid with bubble gut
2:42 What did she say?
He pretended to have a knife.
1980 Mr Olympia was a farce! Being GIVEN a title vs winning it is a whole other factor.
"When the president of the united states has time to work out"....
Hello Arnold im here now and im healing thank you much for alsome ..
Arnold the best the man interviewing is small by comparison and average shape compared to Arnold.  Arnold looks near competition ready in this interview, and at least 30 years older
Stum,bled across this after workout... wow loved this.. very motivational and encouraging. Fist Bump Arnold.
This is pure motivation
Arnold made me lift brand should be Arnold made me inject
Arnold's workout. Go to store buy insulting needles get high and d ball from dad or dealers  inject  go to gym pretend to workout tell people  lies
0:52
heals. peace.
Also das was Arnold da geleistet hat ist echt irre gut. Ich selbst hatte Fitness betrieben,das ist wirklich Arbeit ohne Ende,aber auch diese wie Arnold sollen mir nicht erzählen dass das alles durch Hänchen,Mandarinen Reis Essen kommt. Aber trotz alledem ist es daran wichtig sehr diszipliniert zu sein.
Pandemic brought me here.
LEGEND
Franco Coloumbo chest really caught me man !  His chest looked super pumped man
I watched this video for almost 30 seconds and now back in the *gym*  I'll come back and finish the rest of my comments in a month, behold 🙏
7:14 🤣👌🏼
Dudes a fuckin monster 👌🏼
this is . so cool
that look 2:44 hahaha
Still the best physique of all time!
Arnold is far from the best bodybuilder. He was given gifts over guys like Sergio Olivia, Serge Nubret and Lou Ferrigno. They handed him the ball and he ran with it, that all....
Not sure if America would have accepted Arnold Schwarzenegger as their President.
all respect to arnold,  but alot of what hes saying is dangerous for young natural bodybuilders.   its great for enhanced guys.
Arnold ain’t Shit!! He couldn’t shine Frank Zane, Lou Ferrigno and Franco Columbo’s shoes on his best day. Arnold is a good Self-Promoter. He’s a product of the Weider Brothers. And I’ve seen many Bodybuilders from his era, as well as today that blew his ass away. Check out Lou Ferrigno, and Even Sly Stallone on how they look today. They look phenomenal. Arnold has wasted away to nothing! He looks like Shit!!
Thank you for the motivation. This will help me to create more videos.
Legend legend legend
I don't underestimate his achievements and hard work but he was on gear so he recovered 3 times faster than natural people so he could sleep 6 hours and train 5 hours a day + his elite genetics.
Me Before the Gym: Bless us for these gains we are about to receive. My gf: What are you doing? Me: I'm praying to St. Arnold My gf: St. Who? Me: St. Arnold. My gf: Who is he? Me: You've never heard of St. Arnold? He's the patron saint of bodybuilders the world over.  My gf: Gosh, you Catholics, you've got a saint for everything.
Hasta la vista
He is a machine, unstopable
Were can I get the blueprint?

1:00 That bicep is unbelievable ..
The human body is frikin beautiful.
I feel down. I lost my job, my wife cheated on me....I'm 80lb overweight.  All i do is eat my feelings away.  I have Corona Virus and on top of all that,  i lost my family in a plane crash going to Hawaii.  Arnold what should I do?   Arnold:  Get yourself a training partner!!!
Is it just me but I have seen this since he won... His front pose one bicept is more defined than the other one..
i sleep 12 hours, i'm f**ked!
12:49 say's it all... perfection ,symmetry size ,nutrition, mass ,cut hardness and proportionality. Got my first weight set in 10th grade after i watched Pumping Iron.Never looked back , that was over 40yrs ago. Thank's Arnold....RIP Franco
افضل من مارس رياضه كمال الأجسام في العالم هو البطل ارنولد شوارزنجر
5:15 I just it love when Arnold says "I wanted to be ripped on stage" for some reason I feel closer to him there
Bodybuilding should be about creating a beautiful body like art not like now giant ballooned freaks not attractive at all. Btw just look at those Biceps 0:59 omd
I dare you to say arnolds full name slowly.
Bodybuilding hero love u arnald
Has anyone tried Custokebon Secrets? (do a google search) We've heard several amazing things about this popular weight loss secrets.
I do not think he was the greatest of all time. Bodybuilders now are bigger. Phil Heath who won the 2011-2017 Mr. Olympia's is 5'-9", 246 lbs., while Arnold was 6'-2", 235 lbs. usually.  Arnie won 1970-1975 & 1980 incidentally. Physique contests are rather subjective. I wrote an essay about "Judging Physique Contests" and made it more objective.  One controversy I recall that illustrates subjectivity in judging was Chris Dickerson versus Franco Columbu in the Mr. Universe contests held by the NABBA and the IFBB.  Chris beat Franco in the NABBA contest, while Franco beat Chris in the IFBB contest. Both men were 5'-5", 182-185 lbs. Jim Manion said Franco was better because he had more muscular definition. To me, definition is just one of several traits a bodybuilder should have. Looking too much at just one trait leads to poor judging of physique contests. I agreed more with the NABBA in placing Chris ahead of Franco. Someone needs to know the history of bodybuilding before he can choose who was the best bodybuilder ever. I think Eugen Sandow held such a contest in the early 20th Century. In the 1930s, Angelo Siciliano won a World's Most Perfectly Developed Man contest. He later called himself Charles Atlas and sold training courses. In 1938 and 1939, there were Mr. America contests held by two different groups. Roland Essmaker and Bert Goodrich won them. In 1940, the AAU took over, and John C. Grimek won in 1940 and 1941. After that, the AAu allowed any man to win just once, else JG would have won for many years. Steve Reeves the 1947 Mr. America was considered JCG's foremost challenger. They both competed in the 1948 Mr. Universe contest in London. Grimek won. As you see it is brash to proclaim Arnie the best bodybuilder ever. He had flaws and is overrated like Bruce Lee in martial arts, Muhammad Ali in boxing, Rolex in watches, Glock in pistols, etc.
Legend
60+ year old Arnold has still etter muscles than the oter guy!
Gyms are closed because of Coronavirus and this is suggested to me by YouTube, go figure!
You ran fucking 8 miles your fucking Christ I'm fucking 20 and I fucking have horrible ankles
معلم واستاذ كبير ارنولد صاحب مدرسه عظيمه وعريقه في تدريب بالاثقال وكمال وجمال الاجسام كل من تخرج من هذه مدرسه وصل لبطولة مستر اولمبيا هذا بطل يستحق بتاريخه عظيم في هذه رياضه ان يكون هرم رابع من اهرمات جيزه في مصر خالد بتاريخه عظيم الكبير في كل زمان ومكان في عالم تحياتي للمعلم ذو مقام عالي ارنولد رامي
Arnold truly is inspirational. His drive,his dream,his determination lead him to be legendary. The best part is his humility. He would act smug but it was all an act. Deep down,he's a good man.
15 minutes of pure facts
The happiest ive ever felt is when i found my passion...it consumed me.
The thing I always remember is that I’m exact in height with Arnold. 6’2 long arms. Yet he still looks better than EVERYONE. Makes me remember just cuz I’m tall doesn’t mean I can’t be huge, just means it takes more time. But taller makes you look better than huge short dudes
Hii
Let's do it💪🌎
Either you do or you don't.... that should be etched in gold.....
A top motivator of all time. Best in the business.
Training at start for his fight against predator lol
I like to reflect the mirror
Great figuer to the whole humanity. God put him on earth to save every strayed, confused dude whether they should scuplture his body or not .
Alright enough motivation ! Now back to your home workouts
now ur telling people 2 use hans sanitizer Lmao
He only had 4 packs
10:08 great to see communication with no phones in sight. Sadly those days are over. Everyone is on there phone while eating
Arnold was the Most influential bodybuilder of all time,sure...Sergio Oliva was the greatest,but
Arnold had a robust mindset that everything he wanted to become he works HARD at it and it PAYS OFF. He’s a true visionary.
Always been my idol
Back when men looked like greek gods and kot pregnant monsters.
No doubt he is a legendary body builder 💪💪
Who’s here after all gyms are closed?
it was a mistake watching this on quarantine.
Most Inspirational man on the Planet. Amend the Constitution and Elect him President.
Watching this video just cost me 30 pound
The visualizations thing I think is key.  I've heard it from a few other prominent people and that stuck with me.  I think the power of the human mind is beyond what we even know of it today,  and if you truly visualize yourself at the end of your goal as the person you want to be  Something will spark in your mind and it will help you get there. Take care everyone!
Love it  proper old school bodybuilding The way it was supposed to be done not doing girly push pull legs,Whilst updating Facebook status with gym Selfies😂😂👍💪💪
6:58 thought its the real Arnold, then thought he's not moving must be a statue, then he moves :O so perfect
Best body ever
I prefer this type of bodybuilding rather than bubble gut bodybuilder,the finishing of Arnold body is satisfying to watch,more clean and nice shape
It`s great to see Mr. Game Changer eating that vegan steak :D
R.I.P. Franco ! 🔥
2:44 what did she say??
Best bodybuilder hands down
As expert, I do believe Custokebon Secrets can be great way to lost crazy amounts of weight. Why not give it a chance? maybe it's going to work for you too.
Nowadays bodybuilding is only about lifting huge weights at the same time have a bloated tummy. It actually is gross. No class like The generation of Arnold
02.44 That chick be like oh my what a body !!
What a legend Arnold is, just listen to his motivational speech.💪🏼👏🏼
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥   Definitely an interesting premise   0:31 🖤🎥🎬    👇👇
Love ❤ ..  Motivation 🔥
And all those guys did not have Joe Weeder behind them, thank you for the info Arnold. And there is a lot of controversy around your championships of Mr.Olympia and much more.    Sometimes in life you need hell of a good coincidence too.

To all the people avoiding cardio due to losing muscle Arnold was running 3-4 Mike's after ever workout. Haha
Arnold is Amazing ! He is so AWESOME!
What's the best Protein Shake can you suggest that is cheaper than Nitrotech?  Musclepharm  Combat I think has milk in them so I just sh*t it after drinking. (Lactose and tolerant) Other flavors are not available on my country.  Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein makes my back have pimples.
Just wanted as much ability as possible and while I'm not into guys I've never cared about how I looked to girls. People saw me at 14 and think wow he's very outgoing and ripped a 155lbs. What they never saw was a 13 year old who was loaded down with anxiety at 280lbs. Acceptance of your reality is easy. Accepting what must be done change it is a mountain you gotta become starting from the dirt.
Whats this about Watermelon diet? O_O interested
❤
TOM PIPPS . FOAMMM - BATON ROUGE LOUISIANA USA . HI HELLO &
I straight up attack the weights . Oh shit . . He is straight savage
All those guys bafk then looked great. Todays bodybuilders are too much. These guys were massive but sensible. Ronnie was just cartoonish for example
Best body builder of his time. Not all time.
sorry, but Ronnie..well..that's just disgusting looking..over sized ..just looks..well gross, vs, Arnold's smaller, but more appealing look to the physic, to me big is one thing, but gross with it..that just kills it
Lee priest was better. Arnold is second to him imo
If you took the proper supplements to optimize your brain function along with the boost of energy and brain function that comes with Exercise you won’t fell tired and actually more focused that’s how he did it
Alguém assistido em 2o2o
This is where i found my true motivation... I want to be the best fitness trainer in my country Pakistan. That's where i am looking for
He’s not the best he used starroilleds
Great video... thanks 👌
His body was perfect wow!
"Sleep Faster." Why did I never think of that?
Father of bodybuilding
The acting class was wasted time tbh 😅
NOBODY will be like Arnold...NEVER
now THIS is a TRUE bodybuilder...absolute legend
Such a legend favorite of all the time the greatest in the game ❤️👑🙏
This is greatness!
that girl probably followed him around as much as she could
Great bodybuilder arrogant prick of a guy.
No excuses you have time you make the time.
wenn schon, denn schon ;)
Arnold back was super huge back then. His back alone won him Mr Olympia
I read lots of great reviews on the internet about how Custokebon Secrets will help you lost crazy amounts of fat. Has anybody tried this popular fat burn method?
The current bodybuilding physique is to look like a bag of microwaved popcorn..
I wish I was born back when Arnold was no distractions just hard work
Wenn schon,denn schon🙌🔥
Ok thank you for motivating me in every aspect of my life Mr.Arnold Schwarzenegger.
TQ
Last Time I checked, the Best Bodybuilder of All Time is the one who one the most titles, like in any other sports. Just saying!
Living Legend
Still the best bodybuilder of all time bar none.... and don't give me the Lee Haney thing about number of titles....
The secret of this legend is his smile😁
Arnold the Muhammad Ali of bodybuilding!
I listen to this when I’m lifting weights
Id my op upload its still uploading in op few in op exercise immortalize it in mr Olympia
ARBOL SHUSHETUMARE
Everyone has always made fun of his accent and stuff , but Arnold has always been a wise man. You can learn a lot from him, no wonder he acomplished so many things.
Easy to do 25-40 sets per body part with a smile on your face when you do not have to worry about recovering because you are on Dianabol.
are you a doer or a don'ter ?      daniel lugo: AM A DOER!!!!
Paduuuu
Why is arnold smaller at the first terminator?
Крут 👍👍👍👏.
Arnold was the first troll. Don’t believe me then watch pumping iron.
Best bodybuilder of all time? Thought this would be a video about Dorian
Arnold not the best he had crap abs
Rest day? Where is this rest muscle and how do you train it?
Great pearls of life wisdom. Great motivation.
name of the minute girl 2:43 please
1st rule of going to gym: buy a chewing gum
If I were him I would have a cry a day from the  way my veins popped out like that
If you have a disciplined body then you have it. You think you’d be cooler in a Ferrari ? No. You REALLY wanna make people wanna be you. Get in shape and chase your money. Mfrs hate that shit
I thought you had to sell something to get that far in this reality.
He didn't have bubble gut. Why are all the bodybuilders today have bubble guts ?
kamal ha yr
Patrick Moore will be known as the “greatest of all time” when his career is over!!!
9:02 I laughed so hard haha. Yeah I had those moments where I dont know what it is all about haha. Confused af!
4:57 I think the Incredible Hulk is pissed of Arnold.
He was big , perfected chiseled work of art.
Holy shit these videos are bullshit. Why don't you talk about your copies amounts Testosterone and Dianabol instead of your useless supplements Arnold ?
You are great of the greatman l like your technic.
Damnnn.....I'm 6'2....26......and 180 lbs .........I'm SLACKING BIG TIME
I was started to lift bricks as dumb bells and got sun light as a teen. Arnold Schwarzenegger I had 20+years delay with mental health and I have a vision and the underworld got not break me but just burnt me out. I am recovery and my path in was and still beside yours. I am a German that always will see you Arnold in my spiritual vision Das ist gut natuerlich
I got my first weight set when i was in 10th grade. It was a 110 lb set,the concrete type. that was over 40yrs ago.Arnold was one of my inspirations along with frank Zane.Been working out since then and never looked back. Im 5'10...162 . when i was a younger man benched 330 at 162 tripled 315 and got 300 for four , All Natural always
None other bodybuilder can replace him he's like God......
Is there any link or videos of Arnold all workout in pumping iron (all outtakes)???
I wish meet him 👑
The oak!!
If Trump has time to tweet all day and play golf, then you have time to workout.
I want to impress girls...but  People say girls are not impressed with nice body anymore..but d*ck. Or the girls have opposite comments?
Employees at planet fitness wont let me train hardcore.😂 wont even let the fans off for just 5 mins😑
The only bb that reach such perfection of mass, symmetry, aesthetic and muscle clarity..
👏👏💪💪🏋️‍♂️🙏
Nn ci sono commenti da fare ... Arnold is numero uno .
he's got a really good voice
You more you eat, the more you grow
اسطورو
"It's time to leave yoo-ahs!" CLassic!
Just seeing him back then reminds me of how gross bodybuilders are now.
Arnold is my hero since a child.
Ronnie Coleman is the GOAT!!!
Sad how he took down all his pictures when He became governor...pissed off allot of people ....he wanted to be recognized as a governor not a bodybuilder ...go figure
Best bodybuilder natural body
i used to workout to impress my mirror    but then it broke
Arnold didn't have a specific routine. He first espoused bodyweight training (Education of a Bodybuilder) then Olympic lifting then 5x5 (Reg Park) and full body (Gene Mozee Iron Man). Then he started split routines and high volume as you see in his Encyclopedia.
2.43 Arnold Shocked Her Literally by His Body <3
Wait where’s his mole now?
Arnold is my hero
when he talks it feels like has talking to me as a friend
Does anybody else read the comments using Arnold Schwarzenegger’s accent.
💟Beautiful and More!‼️🥇💚
12:50 in the video and the fact that Arnold was tall and still able to get enough leverage to lift weights effectively makes him the best body builder of all time. Look at any other large name in body building and they are almost all below 6'0" tall. Kai Greene, Phil Heath, Jay Cutler, Ronnie Coleman, all midget heights below 5'10" or less.
2:55 some clown movie guy who probably knows nothing of lifting weights wanted to weaken Arnold and get him out of lifting. Arnold should have kept lifting.
Simply the best. Excellent motivator best of all old school classic physique.
Arnold seemed to select some great movie scripts:  Terminator, Running Man, Total Recall, Conan the Barbarian, Predator,
bodybuilders these days look much worse than what they did back in the day
Rest day ? where is this rest muscle and how do I train it ?
This video made me want to change and now I’ve gained 5-10 pounds of muscle in less than half a year
The goal is to have a perfect body you have to go on forever. 💪🏻
I never been hyped about drinking my whey protein
Arnold and flex wheeler are the goats
Train like that Ur biggest enemy watching u
"Your goal could be...I want to impress girls. And if that's your goal, so be it because it motivates you."
Arnold the inspiration. The man who create sub-culture with the iron training
Guys. How often are u supposed to do super/giant sets?
Hulk
From B.c and A.D and till now world's sexiest body belongs arnold
Wat great knowledge ur giving to us sir respect
Sorry sir great respect for uplifting the sport but all wrong form
6 hours sleeping a day are not enough for a human who, works 8 hours a day and overtime many many times, workout 2 hours a day, and fucking his girl 1 hour a day. Your body needs more and more sleep if you change your training routine and do more intense program through time.
Commercial in the middle of the documentary so disgusting ,  i remember when u could just watch a video with non of this nonscence popping up.
Arnold is the greatest ever! Who is Brandon Curry? 😂 I´m looking forward to see anybody better than Arnold and Frank Zane.
Arnold is Wright on THE 💰 People need to B mind set On what they Wont out Life 🗣💨 Then go after IT /!!!!!!!\ A wize 👨 Thanks A.S.
This guy looks like *The Terminator*
I just came back from the gym and now i am going back.
He's Awesome, no where near the best of all time..
Man R.I.P Franco.
his LEGACY WILL never DIE
Arnold wasn't the best he was one of the best and the most popular
These cutscenes are gold.
You will look younger and keep muscle if you keep eating plant-based.
My best bodybuilding
I hate wasting time, I say always make time
TERMINATOR
Someone’s got it Dudley
Can I give it back
My bladder
Dr jones dr anaracy
every word of arnold is so much motivation! every single word!
Best bodybuilder with 3 heart surgeries. People get sold to marketing real quick. Of course, his achievements are great but winning sprints and winning marathons are two very different things. Health is like a super marathon. If you cant do 10 minute miles and cant enter your 60s without getting under the knife (think kidneys & heart) then you are NOT healthy. People often confuse image, reputation and character.
Arnold could have won a gold medal at the Olympics for weight lifting.  He was that strong.  Too busy to bother with it.  Nothing to prove there.  Things to prove elsewhere.
Im fitness fan, but when someone ask why I want to build muscles, is that I want better phisique. If i can't get muscles then I can always get strenght. Btw I'm ectomorph, also known as skinny guy.
I feel like coming in the gym day and night
i ll be back
Some people:  Man, that's looks difficult.   A few people:  Man, I can't wait to hit the gym!    Which one are you?
I think Lou edged it a bit over Arnold
Lmao, imagine working out 5 hours a day.   1 set every 20 minutes.
I like the Jupiter by Gustov Holst part at 1:06.
with this body and this hair , Arnold looked like a greek god and still is
*ARNOLD Schwarzenegger,* perhaps one of the most handsome and intelligent body builder ever to walk on this planet....
Ronnie Coleman is the best bodybuilder🐐
Arnold Was MASSIVE but had AMAZING physique, what a legend He never gave up too,  So inspirational.
Wenn schon, Denn  schon. Danke Arnold.
Rest up franky
I gained 10 lbs of muscle by the end of the video
Goals, goals, goals...
20 sets per body part!
Hulk First Avengers
Does Trump have time to work out?
The greatest bodybuilder, nobody will ever take away his legacy
a true he-man.
Un grande, debemos analizar el año en que el Roble Austríaco logró quedarse con el podio.
Ronnie Coleman was the best I’m sorry
1:10 music?
my reason in in calisthenics 1:48
Vielen Dank! Arnold!
He didn’t work out he’s English
Loozer
Great wisdom here.
Bb <333
In my opinion, Arnold had the most aesthetically pleasing physique of all time, however Ronnie had the greatest work ethic and self discipline  in the sport ever.
1200 thumbed this down? I bet everyone of the idiots were Americans. The worlds dumbest country
No excuses to look like shit. Just Walking arround guys that big sparks muscle growth
Sergio Oliva was a better bodybuilder than Arnold...The only difference is,Sergio wasn't blowing Joe Weider
Still a great, educational vid. RIP, Franco Colombu.
hann var bestur á sínum tíma
To be the best body builder of all time you have to build the most muscular body which he didn't..most famous is better term or most over rated
He had chicken legs
Great film.
The irony is the Pope doesn't work out & has lived longer then ur training partner.
Arnold couldnt be touched...if you wanna be that guy then you need to listen to the best that be there before you
"Wenn schon den schon"...🤗💪
Arnold's range of motion was always extensive, he seemed to have Herculean rotator cuffs because I never heard of an injury. His flies and behind the neck presses would wreck a mere mortal for sure. It definitely contributed to his athletic musculature that makes this era of bodybuilding the most appealing to the mainstream.
I have overflowing amount of respect for this man
Legend.
She’s the original definition of soaked panties 😭😅 @2:42
Arnold..... Franco, Steve Reeves and Joe Weider are talking bodybuilding and waiting for you....
Listen to Arnold's Autobiography, amazing.
what u r left with talking taliking bla bla bla  nothing moron go to thr right way
You gonna be inside the muscle .......wooow word
Rip Franco Colombo 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I agree. I think Arnold Schwarzenegger is the best bodybuilder of all time. He is the reason why i started working out. I'm not a body builder. I just want to get in shape and build muscles to look good. I need to keep shocking my muscles lol
how do u know how to train properly? and how do u know what diet to get on? i am 18 and i want to learn how to do all of that, but don’t know where to start.
i see so many of these guys spend more time texting on their stupid phones during their workouts than actually doing their workout!  What the fuk is wrong with these losers??  They should stay home if they want to text!
Most of us are lazy thats the problem. After work we want to "relax"  or go and have fun
Jeff cavaliere : *how imitating arnold is killing your gains*
Man that peak on his bi is insane
Legend 💪
Arnold had a horrible physique. I am a Ronnie Coleman fan!!!
He is just 28 years old at that time
I want to be strong, fast and fit and smart so I can help people that are not when disaster strikes.   It's not a matter of coming short because it's my dream. It's not for me it's for other people. If I fall short of my goal it's the people who pay the consequences. What happens someone gets injured or dies because I'm out of breathe or can't lift 50 lb more or didn't have the mental experience. I can't fail because then I fail the victims of a crisis.
Nice inspiritaion My Idol Arnie !!
Don't just watch him, take off your shirt and join in.
Ronnie Coleman: am I a joke to you ?
2:44 its not that she was just looking at his body, her eyes clearly states that she wanted him inside of her. its that obvious.
Arnold is real legend
Have a vision and focus only on the vision....inspiring.
His name has the n word and he is white
he's a miniture hulk  lol
Wo sind die deutschen😂😂
with this body you can do or be, what you wish or desire.Arnold use full potential of life and health
8:08 nuff sed
He is a legend, was the greatest bodybuilder not just for definition.. but for his ideology, hard work and respect for his profession.
Your mommy catia Olsen signed up for this
Frank zane
6' 2", 240lbs?   Fat ass
140 240 455 1240
Say what you want about Arnold, but the man has continued to be an inspiration.
Back then they looklike Greek gods ..now freaking ninja turtles
GOAT
This video is powerful
12:54
Only bodybuilder who was as big as Arnold at that time was Tookie
I don't have time to watch this video
Arnold or Mike O’hearn
Be inside the muscle 😳 Sleep faster 👍 Have a vision👍 Listen to this and forget that 4yr degree and loads of debt. If your tired, So what?! Your vision should motivate you towards your goal. Think about that twice😍 Pure Gold👍👍👍
Aqui é Brasil porra
I know where you can meet arnold, ive Met him at the same place four times now
Arnold he is my hero forever
This is so inspirational
"You have to go on forever"
8:10 he looks crazzy lol
You can't not respect this great man
Meu ídolo
He is a great example. He did so much good stuff in his life.   Good man.
What's really shocking about Arnold is how he's been living in America for 40+ years and his accent is still the same as it was in his twenties.
Arnold always been and be the Greatest of all time in bodybuilding.
His Guns are Amazing.Spent half my life at Awww Over this Dudes arms alone dam
Best bodybuilder of all time is Ronie Coleman
I admire him so much.
I am fan of arnold from indin
Bodybuilders back then could actually pose. Today they cant even hit a proper pose and are out of breath within 5 seconds of holding a pose.
This man is a legend, he invented the term "Go hard or go home"     Me: I gotta start working out 🤔
Interviewer from 12:25 started feeling about 2 inches tall
8:50 mmm pizza
He's the greatest bodybuilder of all time for sure but probably not the best.
The biggest TROLLER on the planet.
Soooo Gooood!!!!
I don't like the body builders body of today. Look how gorgeous the bodies used to be. Symmetrical, harmonious and balanced. Today they have huge muscles but that's it.
That woman with the black shirt is looking thirsty. She was about to body slam him and take him right there. No discretion.
I like Arnold and his Latin son, the one he had with the help. That boy looks like him. He needs to become Mr. Olimpia too.
Legand ❤️
I tell you, Arnold is the best of all bodybuilders. He is smart and knows exactly how to set his goals and motivate people. I slacked off on my training for years because of school but I go now with Arnolds' mindset. Be focused, have a goal, and train hard.
I think it's funny when Arnold makes it sound like it takes a lot of effort to lose muscle.
I'd absolutely want the biggest Arnold possible, 245 lbs.  I don't want him at 210.  As a director, I want Arnold to be the biggest possible.
Arnold is number one He is a legend look like a hero on bodybuilding
The best builds ever was Arnold man That v taper he has was sick Chest was massive  Shoulders so defined Massive arms   Classic bruh
The body is 100 % mathematics the weight and breathing apparatus work together therefore more weight more risk of illness.  Body building is a dangerous sport it can actually have negative effects upon us leading to death
actually  BODY BUILDING causes microscopic trauma in the muscles which can lead to haemorrhaging.  Therefore this sport is performed incorrectly even by him
Arnold was a world-class douchebag in his younger days lol.
Some things are easier for some people.. You can have all the vision in the world to be #1 bodybuilder but if you don't have the genetics it won't happen no matter whose advice  you follow, who you pray to, or how hard you work..other than that this is great advice from a legendary bodybuilder.
It's still a shame about Musclepharm ruining the Arnold Series.
The biggest sted head of all time. The biggest hypocrite of all time.
came here after watching bigger story of joe weider
Wenn schon, denn schon!
One of the most aesthetic physique ever
Warum macht der alte Mann nix mehr? Hat doch jetzt wieder Zeit. Würde mich mal interessieren in wieweit er seine Muskeln wieder aufbauen kann.
Somebody please tell me with a comment what "eat and cheat " means? Please anybody ?
Came out the gym. Saw this and went back into the gym
What kind of food they was eating .............?
The most legendary last name
Who told you to eat my cookies!!
The Mr Olympia's now are the reason why girls say bodybuilding is disgusting
ITS LIKE SUPER HERP BODY BATCH 1975 ARNOLD AND LOU AND SERGE AND FRANCO AND ED CORNY PRIME BEST BATCH GOLDEN ERAH
your the greatest bodybuilder of all time arnold IM motivated with your training in your prime with serge and lou and specialy you IM DARREL FROM THE PHILIPPINES..
They looked like deities back then. Massive and chiseled. Now we have bubble gut freaks.
"If you do something go all out!"👌🏽👏🏽
💪💪💪
TRANSLATER ON 10:58  SUPER SELLING SUPER SELLING SUPER SAIYAN
More Handsome than any other professional bodybuilder
Now that is a desirable physique
Arnold’s biggest muscle is his brain.
Look at comradery that existed back then, now everyone will mean mug you at the gym for no reason instead of having a brotherly aspect everyone trying to help each other
Dudes body is literally perfect. Like zero imperfection, straight respect
041 music?
If the pope has time to workout You got time to workout
just sleep a little faster
So inspirational... Arnold is the man
Legend
I wish i had 10% of his willpower
1.1k said they needed 8 hours of sleep.
laser focused on the goal, it applies to anything in life.  if you know what the goal is and it is properly defined it is possible to hit.
Using your brain makes all  the difference. Do the math, do the the anatomy studies, do what works, stay natural, and do it.
Arnold KING 💪💪💪
If the goal is to have a perfect developed body... you have to go on forever.
He looks like the guy from the terminator.
Arnold is a legend 💪🏼
GET TO THA GYMNASIUM!
Whenever I listen to Arnold Schwarzenegger speak, I gym like nobody's business. He is the greatest motiver none second to him. Forced reps when you tired, i will gain!!!!!!!!!!
Can't believe he dropped all that weight for that shitty movie, I just looked at the trailer and he looks like shit compared to Pumping Iron!!
6:54 that girl can't keep her eyes off him.
What a LEGEND!
9:45 I bet both those little dudes had the weight lifting fever after
I wonder if this blueprint works if youre starting to lose weight and want to use it as a guideline in the gym
I mean hanging pictures of other bodybuilders is ok but kinda gay imagine your gf coming to you and there are half naked men
Did Arnold have that big freckle removed on the right side of his jaw
Maybe not best but definitely the most famous
NO!!!! I am the best body builder of all time!!  CONAN!!!
4:46 if you can accurately name the track title and artist I will give you a gift card for 20 bucks!
The starting is better then my diet
Why would anyone dislike this?
Barbara,  Your s, a
“6hours sleeping...... but people say wait, I need 8 hours. I say, just sleep faster”   Hahaha love that 😂😂😂😂

Damn vacations.
Arnold Schwarzenegger - best  Bodybuilder ever !!!
5:33 Crip
I ve seen the guys training with me  also four hours a day blala but they look like shit cause dont use steroit mudafuka
Teacher:Stop interupting class. If you not lear you will not be succsesful in yout older years. Me:I have a vision.
These body’s are way more better and natural looking than these today...
What’s the blue print ? I also got green card through Joe Weider ,who you helped from Europe to get green card ?
"When the President of the United States has time to work out"   Oh boy....  This is awkward.
Best of the best inspiration video to our life
does anyone else get gay vibes from him?
Most influential bodybuilder yes. Best? No. That honor goes to Ronnie Coleman.
The "MAN".
Liebe arnold du bist echt wunderschon
Still the most beautiful physique.
Arnold is legend he and legends never die
You go Arnold, hes absolutely right. VISION. If you havnt got one for your life, than get one!!!
he's the one that got stared back in seventy two.
The mind muscl3 connection
What we need is a blueprint of his PED regimen. :)
"you have time  you make the time" 28/05/2019
Arnold at 209 is a crime against humanity
I need to sleep 8 hrs in 4 hrs so that I have more time in the gym XD

Yeah meh
Good ole Arnold. Check out my Impressions of Arnold and Sylvester on my channel
I would like to know what his first acting teacher thought of him.
You have to be inside the muscle, if you do something, then do it; go all out.   Thanks Arnold.
Back when bodybuilders had that V shape not this pregnant belly looking shit now days
You are a legend sir.
he's the man.

I went into the gym today to do a shoulder workout. Watched this video as I was warming up and decided to do deadlifts...literally just PRd my deadlift.
As the incredible hulk walks by
Good motivational video i like it.
Now everyone has a big ol gut. If Arnold came back today he would If won
No bubble guts!!
It is a natural body
13:22 - 14:42. I really needed to hear that.
12:35 “ But they look like shit”.   I would’ve bust out laughing my damn self.🤣😆 Arnold’s voice is the stuff of legend.
bodybuilding belongs to the great Arnold...!!! the God of bodybuilding...
"They're not serious. Y'know this is mickey mouse stuff."
I show this to my Tommy now i got six pack
10:12 if someone had the what ?
Amazing stuff
Those employees at planet fitness is not letting me achieve my goal of becoming mr. Olympia.
Bodybuilders used to look aesthetic. What happened?
That words inspired me!!!!
13:02 Guess thats hitlers méntality about the jews
I'm sorry but I'm looking for serious advice.  I think I may have body dysmorphic syndrome.  I'm 5"9 223lbs and 7% but when I look at myself I still see a 175lbs person. Does anyone know anything about that disorder?  I think I might have it.
Simply fascinating!
My ex-girlfriend always complained that she wants to lose weight, but wouldn't eat right, and wouldn't exercise because she has work/school. I play in a band and have a full time job, but I also work out every day, I just don't make excuses. I read arnold's book a few years ago and I always think of his philosophy when it comes to making time.
I am from China， I like Arnold Schwarzenegger's  so much！
He is perfect in so many ways.  A true AMERICAN.  Came from the bottom of a foreign army to become the leader of the largest state in America.   The American dream is open to all who have an American mindset.                                  (you still need to have a decent IQ) haha :/
I saw a girl at the gym texting on her phone, I told her this is Mickey mouse stuff..
its all temporary joy. sparky
“I wanted to make SURE I didn’t wasn’t even one single hour”   Arnold Schwarzenegger
1:08 What IS that music from ?
He should have been captain America.
Nah sergio oliva was better
Calum looks like him and in body shape. Amazing
in every field, be it music like rock or sports like soccer, etc. there is the one unsurpassable number one like Elvis & Pele, respectively. In bodybuilding, its unquestionably  Arnold Schwarzenegger. NO ONE trains like him or has the same training philosophy as he did & does still. You're the greatest, Mr. Schwarzenegger, in bodybuilding. And you will forever be.
I WAS WATCHING MY DAIEHT
Still wanting to impress the girls 10 years in weightlifting. Never stop dreaming
how can 1k people dislike this video? this dude is the one and only, the goat!
He looks like the terminator.
My goooosh now that’s awesome vs to now.   Nowadays they look STUPID  Those 1k clowns who posted thumbs down are the FAT MADER FUKERS. That’s right got eat your McDs fatso lol.
GOAT
Every rep which he was doing with his own self-belief . You don't need  anyone's belief if you believe in yourself . That's how champion become .
ARNI YOU ARE THE MASTER AND TEACER OF BB IN THE WARLD
man iam training all day and now iam in my bed at 2am watching this video then i jumped and played push ups i fucken love this motivation you are my hero all time <3
Punping Iron was years after his peak...
her her your uop.....
I really doubt if there is anyone greater than Arnold when it comes to bodybuilding. He had the vision and he made it to the top.
Arnold the one and only professor of bodybuilding.
King
Every time I feel tired,depress, I watch Arnold video. And then I shock my head and I get back in the gym
3 hours and I get to go workout! I'm so excited. I think about the gum when I'm away from it. It's my Home. It's my lifestyle.
you just have to respect Arnold for what he has done with his life.  I don't see how anyone can not like him.
0:59 wtf that bicep is insane!!!!!! Still the best in the world!
And the best bodybuilder to have tremendous success in the movie industry. 🎬 🎥
2:40 lol the girl
absolutely crushes the bloated pregnant pigs of today
The best of all time. Easy.
boss
Anyone catch the "Come to my house and youll see one"???😂 after Arnold says if you want a perfect body you gotta go on forever lmao
Legend speaks out an advise.. Arnold , you are the best 👍👍
That blond girl looked at Arnold like you see a pupusa on lunch time
At 3:12 is that for the side delts?
Chul soon hwang is bigger and better than Arnold.
Amazing the accent is thicker now than it was in the seventies...
Arnold was way ahead of his time. That’s what makes a champion and champion.
🐐
Back when bodybuilders looked awesome and not like bloated pregnant  aliens with spray tans.
Gotta confuse your muscles, do curls in the squad rack!
2:42 🙄🙄🙄  The girl  lol
Anorld am a poor African with passionate to gym physic but no equipment,may Almighty God hear my prayer
"just sleep a little faster" brilliant
When Arnold talks bodybuilding, everyone should listen.
The god of bodybuilding
They put out the same shit.... But as long as it's about Arnold, I'll watch it
He sure will leave a legacy for ever. Bodybuilding wouldnt be what it is today if it wasnt for him.
Toxic masculinity!
I have a fucked forearm amd lifting weights make it worse. Fucksake.
People blinded by Arnold great upper body and personality. ..while forgetting his average legs at best.arnold was never the best body not even close.
Sheep ba look at his thighs!  Great upper body garbage lower.the best is about no weakness. People are blinded by Arnold  great pesonality
came to america couldn't speak english had 5$ of course he had joe, but actually he made joe bigger than he probably would ever be Arnold is bodybuilding he is the epitome of success
Great man ! I always had him as an example !
Arnold‘s day has 100 hours.
7:03 literally looks like a Greek God statue. This is what body builders should look like.
FUCKING legend 👏👏
He is an mini hulk
Wait how was he a champion? He didn’t look pregnant
Back in the day's people say kimosave..... but when it comes bodybuilding Arnold knows best!!
I am all about having a training partner. Mine is way supportive, he's always got this look on his face like, "Dude, you get that weight up NOW" he's awesome. He is always pushing me to put up more, do more sets, and he critiques my form ALL the time - it's like an obsession for him. I love seeing his progress too, he seems like he knows what he's doing. He isn't perfect, but he's always learning new things and doesn't waist time with the small talk. The best part is, I see him whenever I look in the mirror, and there are mirrors EVERYWHERE in my gym.
Even his voice is massive not only his body
Arnold is a man that knew how to run his life in a very profitable way.
Very motivational video

Best bodybuilder or most recognized bodybuilder. There's a difference. Best bodybuilder of all time isn't a title that should be used.
GET TO THA CHOPPA!!!
that girl had totally wet pants ( 2:40)
Go on a diet, sugar free.
Too much body fat
The king, the legend

If I workout like Arnold, I'd be terminated.  Get it? : ) Ok I'll shut up now..
Dont do the rowing like Arnold shows at the end here. (going too far forward) In a year the lower back is finished and there is one competitor less! The straight deadlift is another killer of backs.
5:54  Ed Corney... Rest in Peace.
Gazab baat kaha. Bande ne
Why they are many symbol at the beginning of vidéos? triangles, and others... it's not about or related bodybuilding...

Motivation for my comeback from cancer (I finish chemo next month!). I stayed lifting during chemo which is awesome though
No doubt Arnold is the Master ,Numero Uno
"For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. " (1 Timothy 4:8)
Wait was he shaggy buff
Ron coleman.the end..no drug needed
He had terrible genetic when it comes to his legs
Lol “sleep faster”  This man is such an inspiration.  His words have movement!   LETS DO THISS!!!!!!!!!!!
Mickey mouse stuff haha
Some people will do whatever it takes to be great, even “enhance” their natural bodies with drugs.
arnold is so much better then bodybuilders today.
He should've played linebacker.
touvk your thumbs and liefitt that
he has very big arms
maybe can be the strongest a seriouioss lift wayd mooreed
penetrating glucose heavier weights on it
you can eat a plate of scrambled eggs and feell lfine
He is my favorite!
Was/is he natty?
I'm sorry but I rather train my mind than body building.
gulug gluggggg
gyte full on wter
Arnold is pretty good but training wise his simply way off and with very little knowlege compared to other training gurus, coaches and olympians. Still he had the genetics and the willpower to achieve it and honestly thats what you should take away from it.
Imagine Arnold taking the drugs the new guys are taking.
uder  row , bring too chest row
lay on thick ness , bent over rows back , t bar rows baxck , middle back
audi 8 blue oke
could've weight 200 easy
I could've been in that movie blue form
might not rememeber it , that's how it used to be
arnolds the one again
Phil Heath is crying right now
1. Ronnie Coleman 2. Arnold 3. Dorian Yates
8:09 jesus christ...
Now a days when you look at bodybuilders they don’t even look like bodybuilders they have bubble gut stomach and they try to get as big as possible
The biggest wish of mine is to meet Arnold but am far far away 😢
Wenn schon, den schon 😀
Ask Arnold to give me lessons
Imo still the best body in BB history. Face was gorgeous too and hair was great. And he had the height advantage. He had it all. And worked for it.
Good advice man. I’m gonna throw this shitty phone and make my time more valuable.
Arnold for president! 🇺🇸
The bodybuilding physiques in the 70s were so much more aesthetically pleasing than they are today.  I see Arnold's, Frank Zane's etc and i want to have it.  I look at Phil Heath's and it seems unhealthy and unnatural.
"Go all out" hahah did that and ended up hurting my left bicep 😅
Body Building is kind of gross, but Arnold looks like he's been carved from marble! By far the best bodybuilder ever
I totaly agree 1000000000 % . The best of all times
“And you see yourself as winner of Mr Olympia or something like that”
Yes u were tired..but so what..ughhh
"you got to be inside the muscle "
the most useful piece of advice any man can give in 15 mins.
Arnold hero
اي خدمه انا حر علي اليوتيوب براحتي
Franco Columbo was his training partner, helping to lift 110%
He forgot the most important trick:  Anabolics!!!
He was best at his time but no after that! There are better bodybuilders than him!
heading to the gym now, mentally ready
Most people are just lazy and they don't deserve big muscles like Arny.
You have to lose your mind to go that hard.
:58 boom.
I feel like he still didn't reveal EVERYTHING... I mean come on he still probably has secrets he never told anyone
This guy sounds like my science teacher lol
Brilliant
I'm watching this after 3 years . This clip gave me a kick to get up an work my ass off.   No one believed me, to many negative people with their negative vibes. But tht negativism gave me hope ,saying 'I need to prove them wrong' an  today i am appreciated by the same people .
bodybuilding was great until ronnie came and ruined the sports forever.... after 2000 he brought  the worst looking phisique... which was carried forward by phil the gut heath....happy to see rhoden winning in 2018... best bb were - Arnold , haney , dorian , shawn ray , kevin levrone , flex wheeler
The video says greatest bodybuilder of all time, but then i click the link and it's not Dorian Yates??? ;)
today is sunday and for more my rest day... i was very bored and tired at home after a long saturday with friends. while watching this video, i got up and drank a full cup of weight gainer, called my out of shape weak gym partner and told him to do the bag. we are going to the gym(a out of town gym, in italy they suck. they barely open on Sunday, so here we are going out of town and paying for the day to go there and work) these are the videos the get people motivation to not be lazy and get out there and work
I want to meet Arnold and Tell him that he is the best Bodybuilder that Ever lived 💪🏽😎
2:46  who's that girl?
i agree, for those that say they have no time is bs, like armold says, you make time, and 1 hour out of your day to lift weights is no excuse for anyone that wants to get in shape, and the problem with people these days is they have no urge, no motivation, no consistancy and just plain up cant be bothered, full of excuses saying oh they have to do this or they have to do this, or they are too tired, or have a negative way of thinking,  or give up because they want results straight away, or cant go through the pain barrier, working out is not just physical its alot to do with being mentally focused aswell on the goal you want to achieve, like tom platt says in total rebuild, the human body has to break down muscle fibres to repair itself and grow larger, and that takes time, yes it is going to hurt, no its not easy, and you do need time to repair those torn muscle fiberes, but if you have the determination to demand for change, and put in that hard work, you will succeed and get results
arnold is my motivation
You gotta work your ass off to get what u want in life it ain't gonna come easy
So are we just gone not acknowledge the juicing? Asking for a friend.
absolut great man
For me,  what is the right supplement brand to buy , i mean there is EAS USN ON i dont know what is real and also what is priced correctly. Sometimes just because the product is made in the USA it doesnt mean its the shit, or does it? Local brands versus Intl brands, i dont know.  Its like DJs,  there are so many good djs out there not just Armin or Tiesto or Oakenfold or Cox, its just the marketing that changes that appearance or perception. So anyways, please somebody , help me understand what a decent supplement brand is ?
Arnold is a great bodybuilder and also an intellect human being who has inspired throughout the world with his work ethics and passion for the bodybuilding.
love it
8:08 classic Arnold.
Just sleep a little faster, best thing ive ever heard
legendary word in end    regarding time
This is why Arnold will be the best body builder ever.
Watching this at 1am was a bad idea, wana hit the gym so bad now😩
2:44 lmao
With Arnold it was the mind as much as the body. The basic principles he speaks of can be applied in anyone's life. It doesnt mean you'll be another Arnold, but you can use his advice to improve.
2:43 the way that girl looks at arnold is amazing thats what motivates me to workout everyday ;)
Man how lean and bulky at the same time.
I hope people don't workout like Arnold. He was on gear like every other pro bodybuilder. It is much easier to recover using that.
His is the best physique ever....he's huge and ripped and aesthetic at the same time...
mind in the musle
A little Dianabol also...
The best physique of all time.
That girl at 02:40 had to change her panties after Arnold walked by. Panty - Tsunami ! ! !  Oh, I have to correct myself, we are talking about Arnold, I'm sure she didn't even wear  a panty.
Yeah yeah but the thing is that im already training hard but my body doesnt grow up, i want to look good for summer but if my body gets 500gr of muscle in 5123124 years, what can i do?
He is a philosopher
2:40 thats one of the reasons why most of us train. pure motivation
Is six hours of sleep really long enough for muscle recovery and growth in most people??
5:21 Great point about the cheat meals, but why in the blueprint to mass on Saturdays it tell you to eat a cheat meal??????
I say: "just sleep a little faster" What a legend.
Que sentirá o pensará el verse en esos años que era un casi un Dios y ahora un simple mortal?
Arny - the best ;) !
The current bodybuilders don't match or come close to Arnold's time.there bubble guts and how bulky the look is just sad.
I got into training because of the guys from this era. No way my kids want to look like the bodybuilders of today. They can't walk up stairs without getting out of breath.
He had more of a 4-pack than a 6-pack
After watching this video I keep waking up 2 hours earlier thinking about him sleep faster
Not the greatest but the most famous on the world
Watching this on Monday , 12:25am... get to the gymmmm!!!!
I like Arnold from a kid till know one motivation I have is never give up and anything I do.
My insperation is his chest and shoulders
The Lord is more important than anyone and anything
He said that not me
The Lord made it possible for us to make stuff
Goat
I liked bodybuilding from that period.  Arnold was big but athletic looking.  Now days the body builders are so bulky it’s gross to me.
Arnold and haney is the great of modern bodybuilders! Combination of great shape simetrycal and amazing thickness
It's actually really cool how that works on how your supposed to outsmart your body parts by tricking it with different weight,exercises and all that
2:43 Penny for HER thought. 12:57 "This is Mickey Mouse stuff"...
arnold just debunked most of these fitness guys i heard a guy say dont have a deadline you should have a deadline
The guy in the grey shirt talking , literally looks like the terminator
Arnold used to run "tree" miles
I just ate a free pizza from Papa Johns... fml
he has the most beautiful body of all time a man can ever have....i mean yeah there are lots of other body builders with great body but i personally think Arnold has the best one
I feel like he aged gracefully
Is he natural ?
Arnold has a bicep on his biceps
i watch this video whenever i'm desperate for food
whats the german expression that he says
A great teacher he's been there and done it all
The legend .....💪💪💪💪💪🎖🏆🏅🎖🏆🏅🎖🏆🏅🎖🏆🏅💓💗💝💓💕
What a great example of achievement and accomplishments
I can't believe they're sitting there eating with Beers on the table with the meal. Cool diet !!!
Legend never die they pass down from generation from generation . the flame arnold light into my torch is still small . i set my mind before i hit the gym . GO GET MR OLYMPIA TITLE
Hasta Lavista
So motivational
Wenn schon, denn schon xDDD
Hate him love him Arnold is one of the best
Nice one arnlod☝️💪💪
Man, this is just great. Arnold's concentration, motivation and determination is off the charts! A true inspiration.
What an impressive and interesting man
I am tired if people calling him the best bodybuilder ever thats total crap,winning a mr O in the 70's wasnt that hard as there was only like 5 people to compete with and the judges back then were way more shady than today 10 years ago or even 20.  They always made him win because he was tall.
i like how arnold did reps like he cant do one more if he tried then does like 10 more lol
You have Time ! You make the Time !! - Arnold Schwarzenegger
Arnold swaznager good human
I'm starting to work out because I feel people are looking through me
He found his talent and had a goal for success. What about the people who are untalented like me and can not figure out anything.
Breaks  @6:40 || @7:40 ||  @8:40 || @13:40
2:43 ummmm
His technique ive been told are wrong with certain exercises. I wonder who I will listen too, the best bodybuilder of all time, or a fat middle aged man from my gym. Tough one
He was born to training like a king of bodybuilding!
He is so right ! I hate those motherfuckers who take their smartphones with them to the workout !!! They done take it serious
Wennschon, dennschon. Genau Arni so muss das sein.
Could you imagine the outrage if a director forced a female actor to loose a ton of weight, even weighing them in lol
How can you dislike Arnold? Greatest person ever!
So inspiring! 5 hrs a day in the gym? then wtf these days fucking docs talking about cortisol stress hormons and  catabolic shit???
I'm visualizing 30 sets per muscle and I almost fainted
Wow! This is amazing! So glad I watched this.
Here..this is a brilliant legend
Arnolds a fucking champ
I think arnold is best builder of all the time because hi made his body naturally and heavy lifting today body builder physical look great but not lift heavy because they use exercise low and supplements more
"You´re gonna see guys texting, they´re not serious. This is mickey mouse stuff... you know, you train or you don't!" Arnold Schwarzenegger - The wisdom of a true titan!
"Sleep a little faster"   -Arnold
This video it motivates me so much I love it . With all respect to Arnold,  this is the best video .
I don't think they believed in haircuts back then
Nope that belongs to Dexter Jackson hes won more shows than anyone and that includes Arnold.  Arnold is beyond overrated
Arnold chicken legs lmao
The King speaks 💪🏻
I’m going to grow up like Arnold
Watermelon diet you say?  *Puts watermelon down*
old school it was cool P.S Arnold the Best
Things have changed, knowledge has changed,  Arnold talks of 5 hours training and no sleep, today bodybuilders understand that short training sessions of an hour and lots of sleep is more effective.
I think this video will help me quit drinking
I listen to Arnold before guy . Gets me gassed up
Those dips are NICE! PERFECT .
Even arnolds biceps have more bicep then me
I'm more of a Big Ron fan but this was 15 minutes of nothing but the truth.
A fucking legend in all aspects 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💪🏽
wenn schon denn schon
Everything he says in this is so true
arnold like, sleep 6 hours jajajjaaj thats why a nigga be having heart problems and shit
Trill he is not the best Ronnie Coleman is the best of all Times
Franco Colombo changed his name to Rock Wayne see him almost everyday....small world..
The most powerful word in the world is attitude his minds eye 👁  was so powerful
The truth... telling from my own experience, was always skinny and girls didn’t even want to talk to me. Started lifting and made lots of gains. It definitely gave me confidence and made me strong both from inside and out. Funny how things change.... all i have to say now is “GET ON YOUR KNEES” been mawing lawns ever since 😎
ارنولد
Those fukn lats are unreal.
this is inspirational
You forgot to mention riods
Super man
This dude interviewing arnold is definitely skipping neck day...
So is it okay to workout in 1 hour each day?
825 crossfitters dislike this
One of the reasons I always leave my phone in the locker when I do my work outs.
one imp thing to learn from this is The Healthy comptetion feeling..no animosity between these legends though..
I love you , my hero
“This is Mickey Mouse stuff” lmbo, you gotta love Arnold.
♥
Wenn schon, denn schon xD
This is to much inspiration. This man speaks value in his words.
the only pictures that i have are the pictures of arnold at his best.
Neuroscientists say that people need a bare minimum of at least 7 hours a day to function without impairments to 9 hours. Any less and testosterone levels take a massive nosedive until patterns stabilize. Wouldn't take him up on that 6hr bullcrap. It diminishes life quality and possibly lifespan.
This mans determination is ridiculous.
Hi Arnold .... iv had a spinal surgery, broken leg and now nerve decompressed ..... I wpould like to build up slowly.... what would your recommend ? Btw you look amazing 😉
- wenn schon denn schon!!!
Arnold Strong is the best in the world,,
Kinda scary to know his whole motivation is as simple as "Wenn schon, denn schon".
Thanks so sweet
"Wenn schon, denn schon."
He's A Legend !!!! Whatever he says that's All 100% RIGHT !
He  was, he is and he will remain  the LEGEND....................BE OR NOT TO BE
24 hours a day well here how its divided nowadays: 9 hours sleep because work exhaustion, 10 hours office work( if not overtime), 2 hours stuck in traffic, 2 hours taking bath/eating/chatting with family, you left out with 1 hour barely can reach gym in it...
Arnold wasn’t some idiot meathead very educated in the anatomy health fitness and charismatic wrote multiple books
my motivation...the legend Arnold Schwarzenegger 💯❤️
" I don't miss one single our " ..Respect
He Talks shit! Its just Stereoid !
When u think man made of muscle- just remember Arnold
My goal is to show my family I’m more than just a fat kid i want to change to prove them I can get a good body
I would love to see what reg park replied about putting the mind into the muscle... They cut it just as he spoke
What?? Working out 5 hours a day????
......And I’m going to the gym
arnold ; YOU MUST HAVE GOAL LIKE BODY BUILD TO IMPRESS GIRLS  :D i rather shit on my hands and clap em :D
Arnold the great!
I like Arnold's real talk,  "other guys did the same workout but they looked like shit"   And about understanding why, what you want out of your body ect. And to take joy in your work. I'm no body builder, but it's inspiring anyway.  And I'm going to try harder, and better than I did before.
"Emergency golds gym, subject is 6.2 yellow muscle shirt... he's one gigantic mfer!"
2019 ???
My idol 💯
This is one of the best physiques of all time. The proportions were perfect. Guys today have legs that are way too big and look like freaks rather than guys that people want to look like.
You are truly an inspiration, Arnold.
my problem is I feel shy to train because I don't know how to train with dumbbells bar plenty of staff I don't know how to do it and I know some people will laugh at me
Was geschieht hier…Ya Dummy. You called that a legacy…I call it a legacy for Dummies and Meatheads. I believe you have suffered from chronic testicular neuropathies due to steroidal over use and whanking. By the way Arnold, did you fall on your head when you were very young?? I don't know about  you Arnold, but didn't your mother teach you anything. I mean screwing around with the help is not very wise Arnold…even though she was a sexy latino thang…lol I got to go Arnold because I can't stop laughing at your life…hee..hee.,hee Cheers, Uncle Hexy…lol
lol, you only need 6 hours of sleep.... I love that part. I love you Arnold.... no homo love doe lol
Thank you for the inspiration and motivation! I love you.
why did i have to watch this while im sick
The best & the most attractive actor ever!!!!
BILL PEARL IS THE BEST BODYBUILDER OF ALL TIME     TRUTH HURTS bear it SHOE FITS wear it
I think Arnold would have been more successful had he been more motivated. LOL
Bodybuilding is Arnie
Get to the choppa
Impresionante documento de las pesas del siglo x1 no tengo palabras
Me caes muy bien arnold se nota k ablas coeherente
Arnold the best body
i am a huge fan of you and i want to do all of your methods
haha Lou ferrigno from the hulk casually walking by arnold!
this makes me vant to very out
They have to make an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie about his life like they did with biggie and NWA
How did he making a living if he worked out 5 hours a day??
Who is this guy? I would like to train him :-D
Back in His Time They didnt done Cardio Running 3-5-8 miles :) Thats Bullshit Otherwise Respecr
Great motivational video
An absolute true champion, his advise is priceless.
Love you sir and respect you to
My imperial idol
Can I keep my door I got fat
14:34 "When the President of the United States has time to work out... then you have time to work out." Hearing that, you know this video is at least older than 1 year. Am I right?
Legend!
what  a moron hes blinded by the fact he has the right genetics
Idk why, but whenever i see a body builder(no offense) like, when I look at their neck, I jus imagine a VERY skinny person jus comming out😂😂😂
Austrian Bodybuilder..he is a legend for Fitness world..the best Bodybuilder
I'll be bach for more..
You must have a vision and a goal. Time to cook. Sub our #Chefs to live longer.
Get to the basic workout, then get to the choppa!
6 hours of sleep? dont bodybuilders need to sleep 8
Respect man
I come back here for motivation because i love working out everyday to be healthy, be fit, and fulfill my dreams to be a bodybuilder.
Elle sucked manual.
He is not just a successful person but a good human too
Get to the chopperrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Sir m ur big fan i lv u sir u r owsm mindblowing historic
14:37 the pope should spend more time in the gym and less time reading the Communist Manifesto.  He repackages Stalinist rhetoric about equality like a collectivist tyrant idiot. The individual is paramount. Statists are bloodthirsty tyrants who should be squashed and shunned and rebuked. The pope would turn us all into Cuba if he could. F*ck the pope.
I at a pizza before this and regret every single bite of it.
Wait wtf, how did he gain that much muscle with only 6 hours of sleep. Ive always thought that a good amount of sleep was vital for your body and muscle development.
Actually itsnl been shown 4.1 million times
00:58  Amazing moment
13:25 13:37
Imagine going back in time and working outwith the OAK
“Either you train, or you don’t”. It is really that simple folks
Go all out
"I don't know my life" loooool Same here Arnold
I now know why I love this GOD I'm going to the gym tomorrow and I don't care if I do something wrong
thank you for making my dream.
I'm a kid but my dream is to be one of the best bodybuilders in the world I have been training for a couple of years now.
It’s confusing because he says he trained one body part a sessio which is standard bodybuilding knowledge and then he said supersetting chin ups with bench press (mixing push with pull exercises) which is contradictory. So what’s the answer? I never mix push and pull together in a workout but he says it creates better definition etc ..
You Guys Should Check Out The African Workout Group Called GoldCoastWarriors They're So Cool. Their Instagram Page Is @goldcoastwarriors.
Arnold is a B.B.O.A.T. ! "Body Builder of All Time"
Where did his muscles go
I always workout with my friends and we challenge each other who can lift more in other word we called it tag team.. hahahahaha
2:43 the girl was thinking Is he human or Terminator 😂!!
Can we please acknowledge that fucking bicep peak. Jesus his bicep birthed another bicep
Ronnie Coleman would smoke him  if he was in same era
How do you write that German phrase at 13:00?
2:43 mirin.

Arnold is not just pure muscle. He is a Genius
Wenn schon, denn schon!
2:42 date someone who looks at you like this.....😁
8:57-9:11 the mind of a champion. Pure gold.
6:58 Dude looks like a Greek god
the most amazing thing is that those guys who were competing against each other use to train together. the even have launch together. that what I call passion.RESPECT!!
How the hell does one sleep faster. Someone explain me that.
one of a kind - mentality of a winner
That back at 0:55 😱😱😱😱😱
Yep that's me
My motivation is to walk among any public and be absolutely confident and stop caring about stupid crap that ruins my personal and professional life. To have people look and say "wow, I only wish!". Been 2 years already! Learned everything alone and still workout alone. Still get shy in the gym even though I look better than certainly more than half of all people there by now. That's what keeps me going. To become the best I can be, for my mental sake!
Wenn schon, denn schon.
I am my own training partner. I have no choice but to work out alone. I have never needed anyone to motivate me to workout. I motivate me!
WAHY THO YU WANT TU WOKAUT!? YU NEID THAT MOWTIVATION.
Legend ! So you wanna Impress girls 02:40 mission acomplished she is having a mini orgasm right there lol :))
The king of bodybuilding
We love you Arnold,,, respect from iran .
back in the day on interviwes he always was stoned weed baby weedddd
Sleep a little faster
LEGEND 🥇
Back in time, when bodybuilders had a small waist
my idol
GET TO GYM ... NEOWWWWWWW!😠😠
The greatest body builder of all time thumbs up all the way
Music name please
You either train, or you don't ! Epic
GOD for me
Muscle Farm did Arnold wrong his supplements should of been the best BUT
NO ACCESS OF SUPPLEMENTS and any kind of shit that body builders now these days use.  As a gym rat myself, i'd understand why Arnold became the symbol of body building. It's because all of his muscle is the fruit of pure brute and raw training without the aid of supplements. All natural diet. No amino tablets, whey proteins and fancy supplements. Man this makes me want to try out his way. The natural way!!!.
Love you Arnold you are the best in the world❤
14:34  lmao its for sure our president doesn't work out
WHEN I SEE GUYS TEXTS ..THATS A MICKEY MOUSE STUFF
Listen kids you'll be makin bake
everybody take a look at that pulling machine that arny gets on at 11:30 there's no padding!  now thats just something you'll never find in todays gyms, now everythings for pussies LOL, back then - NO PADDING, ONLY IRON!!!!
wenn schon denn schon .... ganz genau !! Das ist nichts was man macht um sich zu entspannen, entweder man will Blut schwitzen und stärker werden oder nicht
Malo qlo
Arnold always brought the right mentality to the gym...lots of people today just don't realize building muscle is mental as well as physical.
I watch this cant help myself put cell phone on floor and do push ups to ease the motivation levels
13:00 "Wenn schon, denn schon!" :)
2:44 "Try and stop me"
Arnold was the first of the pillar men...I knew it
how did that "tensean" quote go? I couldn't make it out even after replaying it.
ohh,it really motivate to achieve success.
I 💖💙 u Arnold...😎🤓😍👊👍
you are my best cotsh love you men
Arnold and Jaromir Jagr are-were- fanatics of practice . Different sort of sports,  but  same way and tallented for it.
Were his muscles functional ?   Cuz he always seemed like so clumsy n slow n not so strong in movies
Body builder, Hollywood movie star, politician...  Arnold is the definition of success

Arnold is to bodybuilding what Michael Jordan is to Basketball
"mickey mouse stuff" 12:57 lmaoooo

I want to get pretty big but no juicing up

"You got to be inside the muscle."
Did Arnie do any good forearm exercises?
man ...these guys were competing against each other but they supported one another so much...
UH .... Y'ALL, LISTEN ITS BASIC...SORRY... I MET HIM AND Ronnie COLEMAN.... Don't OVERTHINK IT
oh YEAH. AND DIET!!!!!!
Give a frickin break Y'ALL ... CUT THRU THE BS... it's the training AND "SUPPLEMENTS" YOU USE...
"They look like shit" 😅
omg 8:27 seemed so gay hahaha
Sod spending 5 hours a day in the gym, that's totally over training anyway. A fantastic physique can be built with an hour of training, 3 times a week, now they fully understand what really makes muscle grow. i.e. short, high intensity workouts.
Legs are so small compared to modern day body builders but it looks healthier
Time for breakfast!... x takes an egg, takes Another egg, takes another egg... takes another egg ... x
greek god
Arnold is my idol . He done it all .. Bodybuilding the best period. Movies the best period  The transformation to politics governor
A true legend! I'm actually following his programme for mass and it's working wonders!
Good thing to watch before hitting the gym in the morning 👌
Golden worlds,Nothing is motivational like Sir.Arnold's speech
I hate guys that don't take the gym seriously always texting on their phones same as girls too idk who's just as bad but like Arnie said they don't concentrate. I use my phone for music and that's it hit the playlist leave in my pocket for hours.
arnold is the best bodybuilder.
약약약
No one is perfect
when i go to the gym i dont listen to music i listen to this exact speech Arnold you are a legend end of strory thanks for all those years of motivation and courage that you gave me . I wish one day  to be half a man like you
The pope works out, yea he benches 290
nobody can be like arnold  he is one of the best pro body builder in the world
he's the greatest bodybuilder of all time 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👈🏻👈🏻 and one day I would be definitely,,,,,,,

Zack really
my hero arnold body bildar
I just watched this and now I wanna wrock out and shock the musul!!! This is one of the best inspirational videos ever :)
i workout because i want to look dangerous so people would fear me because i fear them
watching this after my workout makes me wana go back to the gym
wow, super inspiring from the legend!
hennesy and beer while watching...feel like shit now
The motivation part of my brain is labeled Arnold
well my goal is never become like a bodybuilder or at least never start thinking like they do
"I'm telling you, you have to be inside the muscle!!" Lol
i work out as youngster why because i love seeing my action hero built and muscular, point blank i do it for myself real talk
I get a pump from just hearing Arnold talk about getting a pump.
How can anyone dislike this vid. A person that really pays attention & understands it can take away more in these 15 minutes than a years worth of public school.
My Hero...
theme song? please !!!
8:12 - pure savage
arnold  king boddy  herculllllll
I watch this every time I feel down and unmotivated, helps everytime.
After watching this my arm suddenly looks like a mother%^#$^ mcDonald's French fry
Bizeps
whos the best completely NATURAL body builder of all time? everyone knows he was on steiroids
i have to watch this video once a week, to remind my brain 💪👊👊👍😬
"mickey mouse stuff"...haha.
I don't know why but the young Arnold seems more like an arrogant bastard and the older version seems like a wise sage of ancient times. LOL
2:40   the girl is looking thirsty af       i want that look,    that's my motivajon
not only he had a great body but a great mind too , if you see today's bodybuilders like phil heath , kai green etc they have no charisma  and style , all they have is overgrown bodies  with their guts sticking out .
Lots of people commenting on this so maybe I could get some advice. I'm looking to start bodybuilding and need an Idea of where to begin. Googling it hasn't helped since theres so much contradicting information. PLEASE HELP.
real talks starts from 11:00 & 13:00 he had me 😂
Unnecessary muscle lowers testosterone
I think so... He's really the best bodybuilder ever
wenn schon, denn schon!
Wow. No frills, no BS, no excuses. You get into the muscle. Now I know why he's lived the life he has.
Ur my best
I have to try that sleeping a little faster.
You can apply the same skills to any other goals you have in life
I love arnold
and to the 450 trolls that didn't like this video stop hating
wow Arnold Schwarzenegger just gave me so much inspiration to go all out on my work outs now
This is Mickey Mouse Stuff LMAO
My personal trainer
I LOVE Arnold a lot since he became my hero in my childhood ---Terminator
nice video! mind checking out my channel!!?
frankly Arnold cant be a legend of all time,he is a legend but all the body builders has something to show too, people now are working harder than Arnold ever did.
where has arnie muscles got to he looks a shadow of his former self
supeet star
wow.  It's hard to believe arnold could attain that physique in the 70s.  He was definitely ahead of his time.
Dude this body is Art
n
whats the intro song?
This man has always shown humility.
4:57 Watch out "hulk"passing through
yes. That s me
Aesthetically the best ever.
Anti-aged Person
the way he trains is just like no one can ever copy that, he is just too creative.
n1 bodybuilder ever !
Makes me feel so small :(
his words not just apply to bodybuilding; I am really "PUMPED UP" to do what I aim to do.
Grab your wallet.
Nice
oh my god
no pain no gain💪💪💪💪

4:54 Lou Ferrigno
2:44 that chicks vag is like a monsoon.
Arnold is best of all time
How is Arnold the best? He had no legs, no shoulders, weak abs, weak low back... Too many flaws for him to be the best
7:17 holy shit that's Calum Von Moger. He really is a reincarnation of a young Arnold.
My goal is to leave a mark on MMA if Insh Allah If I make it one day this man is my motivation
I love body building
I get so hungry watching these bodybuilding videos.
I went to gold's gym for three days, I had to have tunnel vision there were so many hot guys lol
I have zero interest in bodybuilding. But his mental game is fucking on-point here to improve my surfing. You can apply Arnold's passion, intensity, and hunger towards anything in life.
Anyone know what the german phrase was.??
Wow. This was so inspirational.
She wanted the D @2:43

We should all take up bodybuilding as a pastime hobby.  There'd be no wars cuz we'd all be bros.

I could really see him playing a SS general in a nazi movie.
2:41 that look motivates more than anything else.
Is it just me who's got a massive bromance for arnie
He is so right about everything but what made me tick was at the end about texting in the gym. It gets under my skin when someone is on a machine for more than 10 mins and stays texting -.- like you seriously are paying gym membership to text?
guys im 15, 191cm and 75 kg. im been going to the gym for about a year now. Most of friends take protein powder but i heard it bads for teens.  Is it bad for teens and if i should take some what type of protein powder should i take. thanks
5 hours a day training WTF!! I can finish my workout in 45 min or less with like 30 sets .. If someone is training for 5 hours, how many sets would he finish !! I simply don't buy it 😶💔 Btw , if I trained 30 sets with 30 seconds rest between sets and spent 30 seconds under tension I will finish the workout session in 30 minutes 🔥 of course with full concentration on muscles and heavy weights 👌🏻

credit where it's due - this video is fucking amazing and full of so much knowledge
traduz
Arnold come save me from Florida
Steriods or not Arnold was the greatest of all time he had the best physique and Aesthetics. He has always inspired me,to push even further past my breaking point. This is how everyone should train like Ahhhnold
GOAT!
And he did train 5 hours a day sometimes, and not the 1.5 hours that routinely gets credited to his workout lengths.
So Arnold did do cardio back then. Maybe guys from way back said Arnold didn't do any cardio.
"No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.”  ― Socrates

mass with class
When the weed is gud... 8:27
He's so inspirational...
SLEEP A LIL' FASTER!
Can't we just elect Arnold Schwarzenegger to be president? I'd trust him a lot more than trump.
...And take breaks. Like, when you sit down, and really think about it - set a time - 10 mins, 20 mins. and then take a break. And then restart it for another set of thinking. and really work on that break. Dont let that break be a half break - concentrate when working, then really zone out when breaking.
BS I've seen all this before
Very Nice
Very Nice
My goal for workout... Is  United State Marine Corps. That is my goal.
anyone tell me which supplements did Arnold Schwarzenegger use??
Arnoldsivastanegezer
Classic bodybuilders like arnold and #frankzane inspired me as a young man to win the #MrAmerica in 1993 now I own a gym called #AccessibleFitness that is accessible to everyone and #wheelchairaccessible
2:44
Shit I remember smiling too when I was working out, once the girl asked me why am I smiling, and I was like sorry I'm just happy I was able to make my goal of burning 900 calories cardio, she thought I was crazy but then I'm pushing myself to work harder but also do other things too, I like the way he thinks
Every time I look at some of the new Bodybuilders and come back and look at Arnold I get a feeling of 'ahhhhh'  as if it is a relief to look at a body that is pleasing again. Arnold looks NICE like a Greek god, aesthetic. I feel the same way about Zane as well.
Sure he's doing all these workouts,but he's using a lot of momentum,basically not proper form,help me understand why he does this?Also if he does it,why can't I?
so 4 hours a day 3 hours a day is good..
wenn schon denn schon !!!!

True Legend of body building.
thnk u for this vedioo
This is true motivation !
It's a shame that the Arnold product line is not that great. At least the pre-workout was weak.
he is the greatest bodybuilder in the world💪
Wait, wait, wait... Arnie took acting classes..?!
6:59 boom,BANG,firepower
bullshit. I have seen all this before
Arnold went to Howard stern about a year ago, amazing interview . Just in case anybody wants to hear.
Hey there I have mass over the years takes time 20 in arms big shoulders and thick chest how to define the muscles i am only a small stature 5.5 help me out please
MJ may be the king of pop, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the king of bodybuilding.
can't wait to sleep a little faster
Why am I watching this I don't bodybuild
Now , i see why arnold is a legend of all times.
I lift the gym
307 people suck
When I train I do it in my garage and I concentrate  . I don't know who trains and doesn't give a shit - they need to be removed from the gym permanently and leave the equipment to those who actually want to get big .

Arnold The Best od best
I see this video everyday before going gym  it motivates me alot!!
the man who backed down from Bill Pearl at the 1971 Mr. NABBA PRO UNIVERSE by withdrawing from the contest.
"You want to impress girls" That's how it starts
"Guys texting, mickey mouse stuff" THANK YOU! Can we make this quote a tshirt?
Hes so determind
I respect and love Arnold but Frank Zane and Flex Wheeler are probably the best, most aesthetic body builders who don't get enough love. Bob Paris too
Arnold Schwarzenegger the best body builder best movie actor ..Kai green the next best
sucscript on my channel and iwill sucsript in our channel
big Ronnie Colman was the best
Just finished gyming and this makes me want to gym again
what he is saying is that no matter what a person wants it can be obtained if a person really, really wants it and sets a goal and doesn't give up no matter what.
even today he looks amazing.

How many of those 5 hours actually involved Arnie lifting a weight? Looking at several training routines online, I'm inclined to believe 2.5 hours tops.
I did flies like Arnold and someone at the gym said those will hurt you pshhhh I will shock the muscle!
Sleep a little faster, lol!
Arnold is the fucking king!!!
Army of body builders due to Arnold....
i wanna make a change to myself, and of course to impress girls. who doesnt want to? and i can see big change in my body and in my everything. im still me but in a totally different one, thanks to inspirations like Schwarzenegger.

arnold was roiding since 15 years old he spent his entire lifting career on vitamin s. dont get me wrong he is an inspiration but im not going to take lifting advice from him if im natty, he has never been lifting while natty aside from  when he was off cycle or now that he is older i think he is natty and started lifting again

The man!
serge nubret had a better body than arnold but of course..he was black so could only get so far in those days.
What he said about time at the end is an eye opener
He is not  selfish no wonder why  he had achieve  a lot  more in his.i saw in vedoe help his colleagues how to do pose.he is so blessed. I used  to say on guyz at training ..i am interested  how much  weight  you pump you.my concerned  how you grab the bar , angle adjustment ..special biceps and triceps. .most guys went wrong on this exercises.
He is was very  energetic and strong.i do agree  with  him it's very  important  to have  a partner  some times i felt lazy and low  but  being  have  a partner , he comes pick me up to  training. There  is  no  such good no good  excuse you didn't done this  before  you  had  hasn't  a time.
what is super setting ! can some one explain ...also what is warm up set how its different !!
"It could be as crazy as 'I wanna impress gils'" lol that's the ONLY reason why bodybuild
He really knew how to pose gracefully and to present his body like a work of art.  you do not see that.
I like boys, please send me a PM when interested..!
2:43 that glance says it all!!!
why didn't he get stronger than one punch man
Achieving that Greek statue body..... mmm!!!!!
i wanna be like you man (not tryner be creepy)

Hats off to you Arnold.
Arnold Is always so inspiring! All I need is a daily dose of Arnold and I'm ready to hit the gym all over again!
she definitely wants that d 2:40
BROLY MODE ON!
what's this
"Yes you were tired. But so what?" I feel like my dad has told me those exact words so many times. Maybe my old man knows what he's talking about
Pain is just weakness leaving the body.
he is a legend .. amazing Arnold Schwarzenegger 👍
El mejor de culturista sin duda!
I hope as many fitness magazines and sites get as much info from arnie as possible, the dude is a fountain of tips and motivates the shit out of you.
this Video is the best motivation ever !!!
6 hours of sleep only? Is that healthy?
muito bom
Very vid! Extreme motivating. Arnold is still extreme inspirational! Exceptionally! <3
but... he lost most of those muscles right?
he is actually arnold swats a nigga XD
This man is such a legend and one of the most inspiring role models of all time I would love to meet him once
A good video this
He reminded me of 'superman'...
what is a terninator
Wenn schon, denn schon !
"sleep faster" LOL
Anybody got any thoughts on d-bal?

how do you spell the german phrase at 13:02?
9:00 lmfaoooooooooooooooo
Aamazing
Dear Arnold you're my best character I really lo be you because I'm 29 I want to be like you(this comment is for Arnold )
Ive met him personally and he is a great bodybuilder.
4:55, the guy who walk past Arnold is the Hulk, "thee original Hulk"
If just looking at this man, let alone hearing him speak, doesn't motivate you then nothing will.
I can only imagine Pope Francis working out🙈
I like to be Arnold
I like to be Arnold
Sergio was better, even Arnold knew it.
He is a legend ! ❤️
I love that Jupiter is playing at the beginning. Very fitting, I think.
As always amazing!
Alguém sabe como poder me ajudar colocar áudio português ou legenda portugues pq nao sei mt bem inglês  :/

wenn schon denn schon
The scariest thing about Arnold is...... He is smart on top of it all
lmfao "Some people may say whoa whoa whoa, I need 8. Well, I say just sleep a little faster."
Anyone's lower pec fucking small? How did Arnold get his that big wtf ;-;
Arnold , what a legend !
Derek Carr is interviewing Arnold ..
almeria (spain) love arnold
Arnold speaks to muscles.
Arnold was such a great inspiration for me! I remember when I was a freshmen in high school weighted 140 and then I graduated weighing 190. Thank you so much Arnold!
This is called Hard Work.....well done.
#SIMONOVARNI
Fucking insane
I agree completely with every one that Arnold is the greatest... but, unfortunately, he juiced.   I wish natural bodybuilding was admired just as much...
1am in the morning and this video got me wanting to hit the gym hard! lmfaoo
204 people don't have time to work out
Arnold says, "yes you were tired but so what!?" Pure inspiration
Arnold says, "yes you were tired but so what!?" Pure inspiration
Dorian Yates is better than arny
He is IRONMAN...THE LEGEND
Saw an interview on the web that Bob Gajda, Mr. A of '66 claims he beat Arnold for the FIHC Mr. Universe title.  Bullshit.......never happened!   Gajda didn't want to enter the NABBA Mr. U because that was where the REAL competition was held.  He would've gotten his ass kicked by Yorton, Arnold, Citrone, Sylvester, etc....
Such a great video
hees a good motivational speaker
the legend, the god, the terminator himself.
This was very inspirational! God bless Arnold!
2:40 that girl is thirsty lol
I always think Arnold when I'm at the gym mind into the muscle
who is the beautiful girl at 2:44?
My god man ! I wanted him traced me . Hey, I love it!
I thought Kali muscle was strong
exactly dont be to big. BUT there a bodybuilders from 60kg till 180kg so its just a upinion of tast and how far you want to take it. Most people see you only walk by and see you training, they aint see how many meals we take, how much till we puke, sleeping, jodium, sodium, salt, proteins, carbs. AAAALLLL these details make a winner and a loser (haters)
He wasn't pumping weight he was injecting horse steroids💉😡👎🏼
thank you so much for the upload of this video, can you please add the feature , to add subtitles. as it would encourage people from other countries in other to work out. Reaching out to the community!

In my opinion, the weight on the scale should not matter much as long as it does not interrupt the filming. Too much exercise can cause the actor to become fatigue and the actor is unable to concentrate on his acting.
love Arnold. Greatest of all time. True champion. #Legend
14:42
not the best just the most popular. Lee Haney made him look puney
That is right Arnold !
Once upon a time I was hungry for Hollywood. And now since everything in Hollywood has changed, I lost my appetite so much that really I just want to vomit now. Blah! 😱
I wanna look good but that's to much
Arnold the best of all time by far!!!!
His English was also in its prime
This man make me go 2 gym in 2004 for first time
Arnold was unique because even though he was a huge monster he was in proportion. He looked like a greek god!
So inspirational
Stick Around!
4:54 Lou Ferrigno
I uploaded black and white pic of a guy that goes to my gym he is in my avatar, do you think that back could be done natural?
Arnold was far beyond driven
well then if he puts it like that then we all need to GET TO THE CHOOPPAAAA! !
AQUI É BODYBUILDER PORRA, SAÍ DE CASA COMI PRA CARALHO!
This video is so awesome! It gave me a good wake up call.
He almost looks like the guy from terminator, but this guy is kinda small
Love this video
He was just lucky to be at the right place at the right moment and to have the right genetics.  right babe ?
171 dislikes wtf.
Right on Arnold, never understood that either, your waiting to use a bench, and you got some asshole using it, but, he really isn't using the bench and getting the most out of his workout, he is spending most of the time playing on his phone, If you want to play on your phone, stay home, so guys like me who really come here to workout can use the bench.
AQUI É BODYBUILDER PORRA!!!!!
I'm not stupid enough to be a modern day slave so I have the whole day to train and do around 6 hours a day
Amazing human being with ridiculous strength, personally my favourite bodybuilder is Franco Colombu.
this video is better than any pre-workout
super Video wie immer
WOW!!! This guy was born to be a body builder! Body building was his destiny
I am the GUVEENEER OF CALEFORNIA
what was that workout at 4:12
and my training partner is standing there and checking out girls. 🤦‍♂️
12:52 truest words ever spoken
2:45 lmao she wants the D!!!
Remember that muscle men are 10 a penny.
Ronnie.... Coleman
14:33 - 14:40 I was expecting him to say, "When the governor of California has time to work out, you have time to work out."
Sleep faster? ok got it
motivational
4:57 Incredible Hulk!
I love how he still has his Austrian accent:D
"What are you more hungry for?" Something I need to ask myself all the time.
but they look like shit hahaha
Arnold gives away all of this knowledge for free, to anyone who listens. Same info many try and charge thousands to listen to. Take notes people.
arnie youre best
inspirational....
All I can imagine is him going ARGHHH
I love the part that he was talking abut the time
Great video. Thank you for posting. II brought back many memories seeing the stars of the 60's and 70's.
150 dislikes?  Now that's some mickey mouse stuff.
6 hours sleep is all we need. some ppl say i need 8 well i say sleep faster hahaha
Arnold always motivates... a living legend... true hero and inspiration... It is 1 am. and now i'm going to train!

after watching this video, i just want to workout right now :)
arnold was 209 when he did the first conan - 6'2 and 209 . I think i am skinny and I am 210 and 6'3
yea muscle are nice but this is too much muscles for me I mean i don't want to hug a stone lol
0:40 song name please!?
Arnold took acting classes??
I only need 6 - 7 hours sleep, could never get my head around 8 - 9 hours that most bodybuilders bang on about.
Arnold Schwarzenegger used the secret.
if u have stress, u loose ur control about body. Arnold is very lovely.
my targets
Haahahahahhahahahahahaa lovely!!
more like this please
BUT MY LIEGE I HAVE TO TAKE A DAY OFF TO RECOVER AND LET THEM GAINS GET BIGGER :(( PLEASE DONT DISOWN ME :(
Awesome video video i just watched Pumping Iron couple of weeks ago and like this one it always gives me some extra motivation when i go to the gym again like tonight
2:41 that chick was wet for him
@2:43, she is DTF !!!!
He was great and deserved all his wins. But take a look at some of the guys from 40s-50s...Jack Delinger and Steve Reeves and some others. They looked even better than Arnold. My opinion of course. But I invite you check those guys out and you might be surprised. Arnold was smart and hyped up. That's why he is so famous. He worked hard for all achieved but as bodybuilding goes...I pick Jack Delinger as best-built man in history.
I like what He is saying, the info is quality
13:01 ye that also explains the approach of total war lol. Wenn schon, denn schon. Might as well try winning.
simply the best
Wow. This really makes me want to hit the gym twice a day instead of just once
teen body bilder
it's 12am so I'm gonna go dream about being big as Arnold then hit then gym harder than ever in the morning 💪
Arnold was the last man to look good in a GOLD'S GYM VENICE tank top,now I wouldn't be got dead in one for fear of never getting laid again,not only did todays bodybuilders ruin the sport with thinking palumbo bellies are hot but they have now successfully turned off every woman on planet earth,way to go dipshits,lets cheers to that with a synthol shot
He forgot to mention that he was into Powerlifting before he was into Bodybuilding. You need to have a good base strength on the essential lifts like the squat, deadlift, press, bench and chin ups before you change to those hypertrophy-based pumping stuff he talks about in the video. And yeah of course he was not only taking protein.
more aesthetic than modern bodybuilders, bodybuilder, don't be too BIG
Arnold Schwarzenegger : "You train...or you don't" 12:50  ; " You have time...You make the time"  14:25
Does anyone know how to spell out that German saying he says around 13:02 ?
He is the boss.
Arnold ur right man
Man, he is like the Yoda of body-building. Everything he says is very knowledgeable, and he speaks as if what he says has already passed. Love Arnold, man.
What movie did he have to weigh 210 lbs for?
Back the bodybuilders looked like SuperheroS now the new bodybuilders look like monsters
2:42 ... a gym groupie? nasty...
This is how your suppose to train
...just watched it again! -----------> workout day tomorrow ---------> biceps/triceps  ~ timeless motivation
This is the mindset of a real legend
Great video & information keep sharing!!!
Arnold's seriously the best.. No disrespect to jay cutler, Ronnie Coleman etc because they are amazing themselves but Arnold's my favor to all time
How did I get here?? I was watching a Donald Trump' speech!!!!
very nice
I feel terrible watching this after my only 40 mins workout today
5 hours a day holy shit
I am 4'2'', 100 lbs. I bench 550 and squat 950.
Best gym philosophy ever.
1980 was a joke
I like at the gym
bruh
inspirational!! made me a lot more concentrated with my workouts!
He's so right about people who bring their phones to the gym.Like wtf are you working out or not?You can sit on facebook and instagram at home...
A feast for cannibals...
#insidethebody
no guy works more than 1 hour 30 mins these days you know why because they softies
I am so motivated
Arnold Schwarzenegger you are fucking amazing
today bodybuilders just have huge bubble guts which looks bad, back in the day they looked more aesthetic which is better than just being the biggest monster like nowadays. Arnold Schwarzenegger looked like a God in his Prime days and had no bubble gut which is why hes the best bodybuilder!
Forever a champion and an inspirartion for all.
The comments are filled with bullshit  enjoy
lol I did concentrate right here on my biceps
i always see and hear people talking about how Arnold LOOKED the best and WORKED the hardest, and that's the reason he was such a good bodybuilder, but no one also considers how much his confidence and charisma also affected his great success. I mean, look at 1:30 where he blows a kiss to the camera, or 7:13 where he's pec dancing lol, or when he talks about smiling during his workouts instead of looking down like the others. His attitude was equally as impressive as his killer body.
People nowadays talking about bad form. Arnold got big by ... Bad form??
el mejor de todos los tiempos para mi es el mejor cuerpo de culturista. es un ejemplo
"This is Mickey Mouse stuff" lmao best quote ever
I love to hear Arnold talk about working out.  Thank you so much for this Series.  Arnold is truly and Inspiration and I hear his passion for the Sport of Bodybuilding still in his voice.  Keep 'em coming.  "Wenn schon, denn schon"
i am aiming to the same
He STILL gets more pumped(enthused) about weight lifting.  Greatest calves EVER....even better than the Golden Eagle
steorids
"Wenn schon, denn schon!" -Arnold Schwarzenegger ;)
about to shock these muscles !!!! it's go time
To Alexander I wouldn't say I got smaller  I went from about 165 lbs to 255 in muscle my arms where about 20 ins that's big enough I know what your saying I. over trained no I just had a lot of energy when I was younger .
This was the most helpful video i have ever seen. I didn't exactly know before this video why i did weights and running. Every day i just did it. Its helped me so much understanding who i am. Thank you!
Legend
JUNE EVERYBODY SUMMER IS IN JUNE, LETS HIT IT
2:42 she's most likely soaking wet. those eyes are filled with desire
This guy is the ultimate motivation!!
He is an inspiration.
Arnold is a fucking legend Greek god body
Does anyone know what he said in German ?
true champion mindset
Arnold the living legacy
Golden era- aesthetic statues  Now- bloated frogs   Now bodybuilding competitions are just freak shows
The Master
its android 16 in dbz
This is mickey mouse stuff haha
Wenn schon, denn schon... well played Arnold
I'm having a flu, but watching this has me on my iron bar doing pull-ups lol
I clearly have no where near enough motivation... Well I guess I better learn karate.
At 2 : 45 Sarah Connor mirin T800 and check out her leg crossed,she may be wet lol
I think Arnold is vegeta and goku's idol
Toll ich versteh mal wieder nichts
eat and cheat? Uh Arnold you did cheat you used steriods. Now I am not taking away the hard work of lifting weights, because you do need that before steriods actually work, but what he says man. He tries to act like he's natural.
He made a good point at 6:30, do as many sets as you can for that one body part, but not everyone cannot do this, the average person only does 4-5 sets, that's what I have been seeing. It is slow gains but, he is right more sets the better, it comes with a price, you will be in pain, if you perform your movement right, your muscles aches will keep you awake at night, but the next day you have to work through it. My workout for day 1 shoulders, day 2 chest/tri, day 3 back/bi, day 4 all legs. I strictly focus on the muscle group and do not jump to another. This leaves plenty of rest between each major muscle group, gaining strength and size takes time. Each routing takes at least two hours, that does not include the warm period, if you have the time, and serious about your training, 2-3 hours is committed in the gym. Stick with the compound exercise to start all your routines, less dumbbells, they should be performed for cooling down. In a year I have blown by most if not all the regulars in my gym in strength and gains, without supplements, mind you it does hurt at night sleeping but in the long run, your body will adapt. Keep 10 lb. and 15 lb. dumbbells at your house to finish off your biceps/tri later in the day. If you have to get up 3 hours before you go to work in the morning, do it, you feel better as the months go by.
Concentration  -be inside the muscle.
245? I gotta lose some weight.
I've said it before and I'll say it again -he was thin in the lower back.
Wait 6 hours of sleep? Well if Arnold says it's ok then it looks like ima sleep faster.
4:57 Lou ferrigno!
Arnold is bodybuilding
I think his muscles poped
I have always wondered when Arnold was at his prime in body building could he use all that muscle or was it just for show.
The best of all time... Love that man... I started lifting in high school because of him...
Agree with everything this King says.  Incredible, was way ahead of his time.
Did he lose 30 lbs of muscle to be in a movie during his bodybuilding years? Hopefully not
arnold reminds me of me just think like /uck all the measuring and weight food thats for kids b like arlnold man  i got prove myself.the more u eat the more work out.
for what movie did he weigh 210?  I'd like to see what he looked like.
i squat 340 and im only 16 years old i started squating a year ago with the wieght of 90
Where do guys as wide as him find a shirt that fits?
this freaking guy is amazing
Does anyone else think of the film "Terminator" when it comes to Arnold Schwarzenegger, or is just me?
Respect to him but it's pretty much their generation's fault Olympia looks like a fucking turtle monster now.
Jawoll, Arnold hat recht, wenn schon denn schon.... so hart wie möglich trainieren!
Its time to live yurs lol best accent
3 nasty hungry b**ches when you pause exactly at 9:00
Part of what made Arnold impressive was how his ability to sculpt his proportions made him look more massive than he was. Beautiful proportions. You got guys like Big Ramy now, who is one giant specimen and outweighs arnold by 75 pounds or more. Yes I know all bodybuilders bust their asses to be built like that, but lifting something heavy isn't nearly as talented as making a perfect human body sculpture out of yourself.Just like clay, you have to take AWAY in some areas rather than add on to create beauty in the human form. These guys today don't ever shave their sculptures down where they need to, it's all about freakish mass. Don't get me wrong, there are guys out there competing who're great, but you'll never see them taking an olympia win home until these judges pull their heads out of their asses. Ronnie Colemans body is absolutely wrecked from how he trained, and I feel bad for him. Arnolds almost 20 years older and gets around way easier than big Ron.
I think arnold looks better now that he is old. His face looks weird when he was young. Idk maybe just me?
Calum Von Moger is pretty awsome I like his attitude and viedoes reminds me of Our age Arnold
he is 100% right
Yes. motivation is everything
Best quote in the video- " yeah there's only 24 hours in a day and we only sleep for six. Yeah there's some people who say eight but that only means you gotta sleep end faster!"CRACKED ME UP! XD
would you really want to listen to him considering how he looks now......yeah i know he is old...but looking at him in the video you extrapolate....and he is nowhere near to what you might expect him to be now
I don't do needles I can't stand needles and I just take a muliti Vitamin .and just so you know when I was younger my bench was 650  ate nothing but health food.worked out 7 days aweek 5 hrs a day and went to karate school and was boxing and had my own contracting business.
arnold and dorian are my favorite
Boy the motivation to get big! http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3269499/highlights/280706414/v2
I love this
The thing about the training partner. I do it for ones at work. I push them for doing OT. Make money to get further. Some have debt.
Eat clean every one!
Alternate spelling for "perfection"  ..A..R..N..O..L..D
His right biceps is crazy big. Best arms ever!'n
He is so right. 24hrs in a day, no excuse to not make time for the gym or any workout ;-)
wao
I just "upped" my routine !!! Thank you...:-)
Great Inspiration......Thank You !!!
smart!!!
"whattis DAT??? ...datz mickey mouse stuff" lol true, what is that sh*t, it irritates me as well....
Arnold's body was better looking than the guys today..jacked in the right places and lean in the right places
"Just sleep a little faster."
Has anyone surpassed Arnold yet in terms of bodybuilding?
nice
I notice he always seems to be chewing gum in that training footage. With studies showing that chewing gum reduces stress hormones, I wonder if that helped him out? Shame it's so hard to find sugar-free gum that isn't sweetened with artificial sweeteners.
The best !!
steroides a gogo quand meme
Very inspirational guy. People in the gym over-do everything and don't do enough of what matters. He's exactly right too: if the muscle doesn't burn and scream from shock, and you aren't going all out on each set like it is the last, then you are doing it wrong. We need a new Schwarzenegger soon.
Arnold will always be the king because he did it during a time when the science wasn't as advanced. Yeah he juiced but it took so much more than that. Supplements were in their developing phase so he relied a lot more on whole foods. His diet was much cleaner compared to what you see now.
AaaaCf
2:47...Sad when that girl says, "he doesn't even see me" lol
Arnol real man)))) funny man))
Broscience deluxe
What did that girl say?﻿
I think his pre workout was a little bit of the mary ju wanna.
6:34 ..he  eat gum? wtf
Wow
be nice if one of these guys were honest about the drugs. refreshing at the very least.
what
Too bad he was a cheater
Thanks for the advice Antony my shoulder is better from doing pull downs I can't do the peck deck yet working on it .
this program is surely not for natural bodybuilders. It is full of overtrainings. especially that shoulders and arms day. damn, it takes almost 2 hours and he wrote there that expected 45mins. it is impossible to finish less than 1.5 hour
ripped! totally ripped!
He took acting classes? Could have fooled me!
not gunna lie. When it comes to motivation Arnold is the best. What he says makes sense, and i feel incredibly motivated right now! 👍
i bought the arnold iron whey after watching this0_0
Can't hate Arnold, he knew what he wanted and he got it. Couldn't agree more with having something driving you to reach a goal. Mindlessly doing something without a purpose is like a chicken running with its head off.
Success prniciples littered all over this. Awesome
He is the best
Body builder back then looked like Gods, today they look like nasty freaks.
I want to be like Arnold hench and strong
Nice for does tips Barry help forbul
Over the years, I had forgotten how much of a badass Schwarzenegger really is.  What a fucking awesome guy.
did he do any homework while on college?
I can watch this all day long.
Arnold just has that drive and that attitude that he does what he wants to do and blocks all other nonsense out. That's what it takes IMO to be truly free and as happy as you possibly can be. The older I get the more I feel that way and like he says it would suck to be liked by everyone and avoid trouble or to be like everyone else I'd hate that - two great and very true Arnold quotes
Curious as to what part of this video was as you say "never-before-seen footage" because i saw all of this footage ages ago, all the clips of Arnold in his earlier days are from Pumping Iron and the rest a relatively recent.   Either way i loved it and it was awesome!
"You see guys texting, they're not serious. This is mickey mouse stuff ya know? You train or you don't. If you do something, do it. Go all out."
awesome.
why i am not born in this golden years :-/
"come to my house and you'll see one" lol 14:49
The guys from 40s-50s looked the best in my eyes. That was the real golden era of bb. Drugs only ruin a perfectly tuned perfectly proportioned body. Drugs upset the balance and will shorten your life considerably.
this is mickey mouse stuff ... looll
music around 2:20 please anyone?
arnold is a legend
Bodybuilding.com's channel should take down all videos with people that use testosterone.
This man was my childhood idol. His "Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding" was an inspiration.  Along with Dorian Yates, I consider him to be the best bodybuilder of all time.
02:43....hmm.. think Arnold hit that?
2:43 mirin' af
Love his talk on mind-muscle linkage. So many young bodybuilders have music blaring in their ears as a a distraction to make the experience more enjoyable, and really you are there to do business, focus, and concentrate.

great series
Best bodybuilder all time fav
beautifully explained by arnold !!
Best bodybuilder all the time
Omg this is super inspiring :D
He's such a good motivator!! Great video.
Wow !! Some of the footage I have never seen before in my life. Thanks for sharing.
i wonder what his body looks like in the present
cooooorrrrnnnnnnyyyyy
I was just thinking the same thing Luis
All he said can be used in ordinary life, no matter if u train or not.
It was a mistake watching this on my rest day...
Perfect timing , watched just b4 training legs ! BEASTS !
amino spike harder than arnold
13:21 Excuse we all use of time!!  Might have been teh most powerful part of the video!
A hidden treasure now unburied. Priceless.  The first thumb down is a mofo.
ARNOLD THE BEST MY MOTIVATION
Whats the name oft the song at 0:40 ?
Eternal motivation...That MAN won't exist again. -
it must have sucked to have to lose that much muscle for a movie role. Why would the director even want him to weight less when Arnold's role in "Stay Hungry" was being a bodybuilder? Oh well, it was a stepping stone into the movie biz.
Good video, 8 mins in, cheeky Arnold!
good stuff
