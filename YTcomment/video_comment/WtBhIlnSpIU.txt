wow this is great
Noisy cameraman, I can hardly hear what Hiro said
Yo YouTube is stalking me I literally made some tuna tataki nigiri for dinner tonight
Be great if the camera man would stfu.
I always wonder and never see it spelled out or talked about.....do you bring your steak to room temperature before cooking?
Beautiful
thanks, but ill just take the steak..
Good Afternoon Chef Terada,  the filet beef looks delicious except three  little pieces just doesn't cut it, need the whole steak!  LOL. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!
Ive tried it and i made it perfectly chef hiro
Camera guy it's not rare. It's black and blue.
Love how u treat your fans. Truly humble to star struck fans. Love it. Peace...
someone eat the damn food, i wanna know if its tasty or not
This looks amazing Mr. Hiroyuki & camera guy. A visit to your resterant is now on my bucket list.
I got a couple of ideas one might be very expensive might wind up costing about $25 a pop but how about a venison sushi the other one I came up with how about a buffalo sushi as in bison and a buffalo chicken sushi while I'm at it and one last one a very disgusting one a beef liver Sushi I don't know if that can be done those are my four ideas
Does Wasabi go with beef?
-Good Afternoon-
What do you do with the leftovers?
Those fans are so loud
Camera man, you're fine, dont listen to these rude ass holes, not that i think you'd give a fuck what they think in the first place.
I'm big fan
HOW DOES THIS GUY NOT HAVE MORE SUBS?!?!
Looks like red salmon.
this IS a filet mignon.
Looks simple but there's must be a chi to this.
God this looks delicious.
Cisco paper towels?
sometimes u are so funny with your talk camera guy.
Beauuuuutefuuuuul....! :-) Fantastico.... :-)
how can you speak English and call fillets filets, and then when you write a French title, you actually write fillet.
yummy
so is the camera guy the owner?  He has an owner vibe to him.
Im preetty sure that is blue rare, anyways that sear on the outside looks delicious!
you are so amazing
ew thats so raw
Tapeworms, anyone?... :)
Excellent
when I order steak I say a line Woody Heralson said in Cowboy Way - knock the horns off , wipe it's nasty old ass and slap it down here - that means RARE
Absolutely amazing
Waiter: Did you enjoy your meal? Hiro: Hi how are you.
i need it i need it all
The pan for the filet mignon...great, a real MANPAN. My DeBuyer pans look like that too...a couple of days ago an ignorant woman referred to it as "your dirty pans", needless to say the divorce-procedure will be initiated soon. 😍
Nice👌
wow...I never had the chance to take a pic with Hiro and from Jun 2015 till now I have been visiting Nove kitchen at least once a month...I was in Orlando in a Disney Vacation from July 25 - Aug 6 of this year 2016 and on July 28 I drove to Miami just to go eat there with my family as always...not a little chance to take a pic with Hero...also before I came back home (Texas) we drove back to Miami one more time to eat at NoVe on Aug 7 ...again failed to take a pic with Hiro...finally Aug 8 we came back to texas...hope next time or on September 2016 can meet Hero.
Hi how are you? Hi how are you, good afternoon.
Rare is how I eat all of my steaks💁🏼✨ I want that meat fresh, bloody and still Moo-in' :) It's so so delicious😱💕
Very impressed too wawooow!! Best regards from Belgium dear Master Sushi Hiroyuki Terada
Honestly very impressed you take classic/traditional Japanese ideas and mix them into more modern ideas. Very innovative and delicious! Good work Hiro!
big thanks and respect for your work and for showing the genesis of your sushi. i'm very interested in your videos. unfortunately i'm from austria and i'm living in normal conditions, so maybe i will never get the chance to visit your restaurant. Thank you so much :)
master chef, I want to attempt your dish using tuna boiled potato nicios style. you gave me an idea, amongst others to try! I'll let you know how things turn out. thank you, master chef.
camera man needs to chill the fuck out. rude af
It's a shame I didn't find this channel when I used to work at the Braman BMW just up the street from you guys. I moved to Chicago 2 years ago, I'll have to come by when I'm come back to Miami to visit.
Waste of good meat, imo. Medium-rare for good beef.
what leaf is that?
HOW DO U EAT MUSHY STEAK I LIKE IT BURNT TO CHARCOAL
It might be helpful to explain to the viewers how you cut the steak i.e. against the grain vs with the grain of the meat. This affects the texture if I'm not miSTEAKen. Great video!
I'm pretty sure if you served Gordan Ramsay that, he'd send it back and say "IT'S RAAAAAAAAAW".
What is the knives that Chef Hiro uses?
I would try it, but I'm scared of tape worms, so I'll pass
Wish I could be that kid.. -_-
Tutorial: how to charge $35 for $4 worth of food.
Is it weird that I am fine with raw fish but not so with meat?
I have seen several of this videos and everything Hiro "cooks" is either RAW or just fried or simply just chopped, I don't understand how he is called a chef.
every episode the food looks interesting but the camera man always ask stupid ass questions.... please be quite or at least talk less so we can appreciate the chef's work
Chef Terada, is there recommended proportion of rich to netta ? I was taught 17 to 24 grams of shari..
355,000 subscribers! You were only on 250,000 like 2 months ago! Well done chef Hiro and mysterious camera man :)  Oh, and yes. I was re visiting old videos :P
Kid comes all the way down to have sushi from Hiro, gets California rolls...
Why do I do this to myself. I am so hungry now!
lice
Fres h ava ca do
I am glad that I found this channel
Hy !
I hope to eat one day and have Master Terada speak to me personally. That would do me great honor.
too many annoying noises
I just learn some thing new, thank Chef Tera
I doubt if most us could attain Hiro's Master Sushi Chief skills in our lifetimes ?
that meat was rare?  super rare? lol
Filet**
freeshavacadoo
What kind of oil do you use to sear the meat? Love the series, thank you!
why are YOU always fucking with this Chef? its like you are up his ass watching and talking about his personal dishes. Maybe that guy doesnt want to share his little secrets with the fckn world!you just want to exploit the gut to out money in your pocket! I own 3 Cannabis Dispensaries here in Colorado. I grow completely organic and have won the Rocky Mountain Cannibas Cup 3 times. Why? I have own techniques I dont put on blast to the world. especially when it comes to edibles and extracts such as oils,Dab,Shatter,Wax,cold water extracted 11 bag Hash. Id punch u fckn all up in my shit. I do teach classes that are sold out for 3 months but i teach basics.NOT my secrets. damn
That's how I eat steak or blue even better
I am hungry now. Thank you!
is the camera guy Hiro's boss?
annoying ass narrator rather have the chef talk about to dish he is preparing even if the English is broken
Holy shit, does that look good!
It's.... RAW! -Gordon Ramsay
Or, save all that hassle of thin cutting, get some peppercorn sauce and some potatoes... Done.
Gordon Ramsay would be angry if he sees this
tooooooo raw....
I'm just picturing Gordon Ramsay looking at the meat and yelling   "ITS RAW"
fuck the camera guy is so annoying in every video
why dont u eat it!!
"slow motion" >_ > yup that was super slow lol
Rare is the only way I eat it
Im guessing the ratio of likes and dislikes to this video is proportionate to that of nonvegans and vegans in this world....
i love it..bcz i like sushi.
some balsamic or red wine glaze would be better.
I would absolutely love to eat here one day
What is the name of the leaf, he served the sushi on..please
Is Hiro the only sushi chef?
Hmm, this looks like a dish you can actually make at home.
Er... Nigiri is... Eel, isn't it? O_o how is it beef?
I want to see Gordon Ramsey judge Hiro's food...
is this a real steak??? it's just a raw meat... is it ok to eat uncooked meat like that? O_O
HI hiro I am a new subscriber. enjoy many of your dishes. hope to come down to your restaurant next year. I am from San francisco😊👍👍
absolutely love the videos, what a master chef
its terrible to watch when im hungry
i'd love to eat this one day. i am not really a fish fan. (i hate salmon and other fresh water fish, but i like crab, lobster and shrimps etc. also, seafish i like.
is that steak still raw?
You ever thought about teaching people how to cook? You know like those weekend classes? I know i would i definitely love to learn how you do things!
Genuinely one of my favorite YouTube channels out here! I had to go buy myself sushi because of Hiro's art.  Very talented man and your commentary makes the videos better! Big fan!
steak nigiri sushi, muricans...
Only took a few videos to get my mouth watering.
I thank you so much for share this great recipe. This is so honest. I take a deep thank you so much bow to the chef. <3
Hello, Filet with one L, not fillet.
he's slowing him down keep asking him to slow down. I can see what he's doing.
I enjoy these videos so much. Watching is so calming. I even fall asleep lol
Thank you for the video! I never knew that there's sushi made with beef. Is it particularly dangerous to eat rare/medium rare beef? Would love to try it sometime.
imo eating seared rare beef is the only way.
that cook of steak he used for the nigiri is called blue rare. very short sear only about as long as you would sear fish but quite delicious :D
Can you eat any kind of beef like this or does it have to be this one ?
I want him to try it!!!
I agree with Bradley, the camera man makes the team. But let's not forget about Hiro..... he da man.
Beef sushi?
One day, I hope soon, I will just walk in and ask to watch him cook live.
With the oil in that pan smoking that much, isn't it going to taste bitter? Shouldn't you be using an oil with a higher smoke-point, or did you want that bitter, burned taste?
if i could i would fly over to where your restaurant is and i would order the sumo roll
So would you like to be visited :)
best sushi master :) very best :)
how about adding a little cuban flare cuban sandwich sushi roll but with pickled radish
That looks so good :) I'm sitting here salivating..
why are you having him explain years upon years worth of training to make steak wannabe sushi? Also, when you tell him its simple to make steak nigiri style sushi even though its not on the menu and he should make it for guests who wants it is ignorant to even tell. This chef is way too patient for the camera man
looks beautiful
People often ask me about making non-fish sushi...now I have an answer. Thank you Sensi. Best.
I'm a fan of your channel. but I don't eat sushi if you will.
10/10 would eat this
What do you use the microwaves for?
20 vegetarians disliked this video.
so I can order that in your restaurant?
he sounds like the guy from the casting couch.
i have a qeustion did you try chicken fillet  sushi i wonder what is the taste maybe is this a crazy question
I want to eat the whole piece, not just some slices with rice... Ever heard of churrasco?
I just this with a cheap chuck roast piece of beef and it was tasty!
I don't like seafood normally but I would love to try high quality sushi cause I keep hearing there is a major difference between the two
You wouldn't happen to have a halal option for that would you? Because I need that in my mouth ASAP!
looks blue for me.
i live about 8hrs away from ur restaurant and these stinking videos are going to make me drive all the way to Miami just to eat. SMH food obsessions
what do you do with the rest of the meat? it can't just sit there and wait for another off-menu order cause it will go bad
Looks so damn delicious, you can almost taste it through the camera :D Can't wait to visit you guys some day and eat sushi the whole day :)
The camera man is too modest. This channel would be nothing without his commentary :)
I got exactly same nigiri making technique, I was always thinking its an amateurs technique..
This commentator is kind of annoying, let the chef work! No one is going to learn perfect nigiri technique from a 30 second explanation
looks more like blue rare to me or whatever its called
that is the only way to eat steak
It's not a good idea when you watch this at 3 am.
The sun does not boast of its heat, the wind does not brag of its velocity, the sea does not swagger as a tidal wave across the jagged shore, and Hiro does not call attention to his genius because his skill is self-evident and quietly profound.
yo dat shit is raw beef. wtf why would u eat that..
I salute the chef for his good manner and politeness meeting his fans :) humble man.
Chef Hiroyuki.It so good.
NoVe Kitchen, you know what's the best thing after a long hard day at work? Coming home and watching your videos and drooling lol!
Im an MMA fighter and black belt in Judo from West Palm Beach FL.. I will be seeying you and chef soon!
fake ass asian chef
pretty awesome you guys come out to meet the fans. and that fans from youtube come visit. what a cool age we live in.
That look absolutely amazing!!!!
Where is the NoVe restaurant
Do you guys prepare monk fish liver by any chance?
The piece of meat is totally raw... might as well kill a cow and cut out a piece of raw meat to chew...
6:06 - "You must try it seared rare."   That's not rare, that's raw; the steak is uncooked and cold inside. Rare and raw are two different things.
love the restaurant ambiance, & making your valued customers at home im sure they'll keep on coming back. i'm a Filipino & wish to work & share my knowledge in customer service in your famous restaurant. thanks!
This looks incredible.
May i know what sauce do you put on the steak? It is a bit too thick to be soya sauce i supposed.
that pan?
I honestly hate this channel for several reasons.  1-I can't stop watching these videos, therefore halting my productivity. 2-I am always starving after watching these. 3-It makes me long for things I can't afford. 4-On the rare occasions that I do go get sushi, it isn't as good as this looks. 5-On the rare occasions that I do go get sushi, I am buying things I can't afford as a broke college student.  Damn you. Rant over.
bruh the order only comes with 3 pieces??
Oh we'll then thanks 😂 love the videos
*****  Is it asking too much to do a more informative-how to video emphasizing traditional sushi and techniques step by step, elaborating each step in detail as such as sashimi, nigiri, and traditional maki rolls without giving up all of Hiro's magic? For example, this video left out(imo) a very important detail, the rice ball has a small air pocket and is not very compact at all allowing the rice to jus fall apart in the consumers mouth with minimal chewing effort, etc, etc. I love watching the videos. Alot of talent displayed and great sushi!
Do a dragon maki sushi guys
The narrator sounds like he has no soul, he is too intrusive,  you NEVER ask a chef the secrets of his trade, it's obvious he isn't comfortable showing you how he works the rice, you are a RUDE dog with no manners.
Of course, I dream running tickets, as I'm sure many do when you choose what you'll do with your life. I work for a great restaurent now. Wood fired oven. Running 800. 45 sec pizza, neoploitan, plus all hot apps.
This looks delicious, great technique. Do you guys do beef tataki as well, that's my fave.
How does it feel to have the best sushi in Florida
I'm curious if you can request the meet be cooked more instead of having it raw like that? More or less for people who just have had bad experience with raw beef (i.e. gotten sick from it).
When its Blue Rare... FUCK RESTING!!
2:25 Cesar milan on the right!
awwww why is this resturant located half across the world?!?! I wanna eat there omg.
That's it ima go out grabbing me some good beef, i get hungry every time i watch your videos keep em coming.  Greetings from france.
i know what immmm makingggg thissss weeeek :D
HIROOO MASTER!
love you guys but i think you guys use gmo oil, but so does every other restaurant
Procurem no Facebook Sushiman's vip e acharam tudo sobre #sushi e #sashimi
This is more raw than rare haha
Seared rare? This is blue breh.
I really like that microplane/grater. What brand is that?
If I ever get the chance to come to NoVe, I will. I'm in Kansas so I'm a bit of ways away from Miami!
Great Californian roll is my favorite
wow looks fantastic. how much would a dish like this cost ??
i think that's too much ginger
Do you think you can find a Steak Tartare dish? I've become very interested in Sushi and steak tartare lately but haven't tried either!
Watching these videos for quite a while and not one have i seen the person behind the camera... this is like cry all over again TT
What can I say? You are lucky to have Hiro Terada! He makes amazing sushi dishes! This looks delicious!
what kind of steak is that?
How about a roll with as many colors you can fit in a roll and call it the throwback roll
Okay since yall are in the restaurant business im going to Chicago this summer and need some good restaurants to go to. Help me out!
Very pretty presentation. Yes there is nothing like seared rare beef or steak tar-tar. Also I recently made sushi BLT (Bacon, lettuce, tomato  and mayo). It was great. I used spicy mayo. You should try it.   :-)
I want to see your face in a video
I'm loving the improvements on your videos, the tutorials were really entertaining as well :D   Keep up the amazing work guys.
I've seen so many of these videos that I will probably end up visiting Miami just to eat there
isn't the guy at 2:25 to the far right cesar milan the dog whisperer
Fantastic!
For some reason this reminds me of the 'Sturts Desert Pea' which is a popular Australian plant. Now that I think of that, maybe you guys could try to come up with an 'Aussie' sushi roll?! some suggestions: Kangaroo meat and Barramundi (popular aussie fish). I don't know how available these products are in Florida, but it would be neat to check out! thanks for all your videos, they are awesome!
Raw steak, yuk.  Burn it, then I'll eat it.
Always love your vids guys! Also i want a shoutout! Im one of the few that has had the privelage to see the camera mans face! Muahahahahh
Absolutely beautiful as always, i wish You all the best guys.
It's looks sooooooo gooooood from Singapore
Could you ask for the steak to be cooked longer?
The camera man mentioned something about getting to see him. But I didn't see him... I was always curious to know what the man behind the camera looked like too...
What kind of cookware do you use? Stainless steel?
the kid likes tuna... we know hes not gay
Now you are just showing off!
Sorry for the ignorance, but which leaf is the one he uses to decorate?  And if I may suggest a video, I like all the fancy sushi ideas and stuff, but, would you mind making a video about some simple sushi. Sushi we can do at home with salmon and vegetables let's say. As na example, here where I live the tuna is really expensive, nearly unafordable and hard to find fresh. I would love to see Chef Terada creativity on the combinations..  Greetings from your brazilian friend & fan.
I Love it!! you guys are like stealing the ideas I have right out of my head!!
Um
Did he say ponzu jello?
Ahhh! Seeing other fans meeting you two and enjoying the food makes me so jealous! Need to plan a trip to Miami ASAP! As always, the food and the chef look absolutely amazing. Cant wait for more!
I think the camera guy should try making somthing while the other guy videos(can't spell his name)
How much will this cost?
I need it NOW!!
Have you watched Rat Chef
Could you please maybe give me a little shoutout in the next video? 💙🐶
Looks to die for I need one stat!
just a tip, but maybe use a torch for the steak. this way it gets a better crust while maintaining the "rare" part^^
What kind of oil does he use to cook the fillet?
Can chef do a google plus hangout?
I can't watch it for some reason
Just a tip, let the steak rest for a bit after cooking it. When exposed to heat, the filaments open up like pores, allowing water to escape. To keep the steak tender, juicy and flavorful, it's best to cut it after a few minutes. As you'll notice, cutting it immediately results in a lot of liquid oozing out of the meat. It's best to let it rest before cutting it.
One day I'll visit you and eat all the sushi you have xD
Ummmmm I'm hungry jajajaj
I prefer my beef dry, personally.
Yes! New video! :D
Like always an nice video^^ i realy enjoy watching the video's. I don't make it but watching is good enough. Keep the good work going on. :)
Supper cool
I want!
Love the vid :) I wish I could come down to the restaurant
First?
First!
