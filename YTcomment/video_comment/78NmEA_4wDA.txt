Hi! I'm looking for a recipe similar that you are teaching here. I need that the dough thiny to bake and modelling that on the wood-roll, to make biscuits like a  semi-tube. I intend to serve filled with chantilly cream. Can you help me? Thanks. Maria de Lourdes Saragiotto - São Paulo - Brazil.
These look delicious 😋 thanks for the video.
could someone put the written ingredients and quantities please, I don't understand English, thanks
He didn’t mention the quantities or the ingredients. That’s useless. Everyone make it isn’t a big secret though
Is there a substitute for golden syrup? Or can I not use the golden syrup. With thanks
i made these & all of them got stuck on the parchment lol
Do you have to open the flame of the oven from down or up? Or both?
mmmm chocolate . j'aime chocolat.
Awesome really easy ,  pls want to know what is golden syrup ?  Look's yum .
what a brilliant video thank you. in going to make these using your recipe. i found your video helpful and you explained everything brilliantly. thank you
I got bored watching this video. What's wrong with using a wooden spoon? does this man not own one?
he put 25 grams of cranberries and 50 grams of mixed what? I didn't catch that part
Great video! So glad I found it! You've explained everything so well! I've a question though- I wanted to add oats instead of walnuts, so would I just put in the same amount of them in the mixture or less?
