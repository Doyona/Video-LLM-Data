Anyone in 2019
do u put in fridge or freezer
Why are you dressed like a gay samurai.
I am gonna make those soon and post that recipe on my sait. On Youtube.
3 Ingredient Chocolate Nutella Balls. Yuum
I know . Use Nutella instedd peanut butter. :-)
I changed the recipe a bit and added in some chocolate chips and instead rolled it in powdered sugar it it was so good.
why were you wearing a pink blanket
roll them in unsweetened cocoa powder or sweetened?
these arent that good. I made them and its not that good
Does anyone know if you can keep these in a container in the fridge? (Im thinking yes but I want a second opinion) If so, for how long? Thanks!
I just made these for some friends and they were a huge success but the only problem is I don't care for cocoa powder. Do you know of anything I could substitute it with?
I literally made these 20 minutes ago and they're all gone WHAT DID I DO T_T they were so good though...
are you wearing a snuggie
I made these and they were so good and I made the 2 ingredient cookies and cream cubes and the cookies and cream popcorn they were so good 😍😍
what the fuck r u wereing
it looks like dry horseshit
i love your pink blanket <3
Dang big blanket
Is this a cake ball
Could you do it with crunchy penut butter?
Could u maybe make truffles because inhave been trying forever and mine always come out wrong do rply x
When i made this, it turned out very dry, tasty but dry, what do u suggest i do to make it more moist so its not so dry and sticky?
for how long we can stored chooclate balls do rply
Thank You for sharing this great recipe! I made it for my mom when she had a bad head ache. :D
Look like elephant shit
its a blanket because he's so awesome he can pull it off :D
(looks at profile picture) *see's hooded woman* Mhmmm....
Can I use oreo ?
Can I use Quaker oats on it?
Is there anyway we can just use peanut butter?
Love*
Live the intro
Can you use nut on the out side besides the Cocoa
Also I melted the PB beforehand to make it easier to mix/pour
The only improvement I would suggest is to use Nesquick instead of Cocoa Powder, since cocoa powder can sometimes be very bitter
those look so hevenly i would die
Ya can you use Nutella
hiii
I made this earlier today and it tasted amazing! But unfortunately my cocoa powder was unsweetened and did not taste that nice but sprinkling icing sugar over it just makes it even better!
i trued this recipe and instead froze them in the freezer and it was SOOOO GOOD !!!!!!!!!!
can you use nutella?
Ok thx
totally making these tomorrow
I just made these, they're in the fridge. i modified the recipe a bit but i hope they turn out okay!
I did
Hey can u use nesquick??
Spring rolls please!!
I'M MAKIN DAT TOMORROW
Can you make somthing nachos ?? more nachos things :D
If some woman wanted me to wear a pink sissy dress and I went along with the prodding.  Would my yielding to pressure cause my wearing of pink to still indicate my being a real man?
Super cool! Please make more 3 ingredient videos!
Thanks :D
Thanks. No it's hot here. It was 35 degrees Celsius yesterday which is 95 F :D
:D
i think its his daughters blanket
Dipping them in melted chocolate makes them taste better. :)
Hi scc
Look tasty, by the way is it cold there right now? :)
Omg, ignore all the negativity! Who cares what he wears!! It's a damn blanket -__- he can wear what he wants. You're amazing! I love your videos, they inspire me to try new things. Keep up the great work!! Sending you SoCal love!!
0:00 to 0:12 wtf?
What is he wearing?
I made something similar the other day with crunchy peanut butter, cocoa powder, chopped hazelnuts, honey, dried fruit (cherries or cranberries, I've tried) and then I rolled them into balls over coconut. Put them in the fridge for a few hours, they didn't last long.
Yummo Dood !
Is that Milo u rolled it in?
hehe
Are you american?
I eat raw oats all the time, and I never have indigestion!
I just made these :3 THEYRE DELICIOUSSS!!! It's okay to use crunchy peanut butter, I guess. Mine turned out great ^•^
You sir, are a true genius.
do we have to use oats cause i seriously hate them
looks like a dog turd in the mixing process.
You didn't cook the oats. That will give you indijestion
Lol what are you wearing?
is there anything you an use instead of peanut butter like caramel or something :D
Next: naked cooking...would love to see that. Hasten to say: I hate pink..
hes got the balls to wear pink like if you get it
@ thesunraygirl you can take a normal cup(250 ml) ans Take in the oats than take the Same Cup an put in the peanutbutter ;)
@Thesunraygirl you can just take a normal Cup (250 ml) and Pit in the pats Teen Take the Same Cup and put in the peanutbutter;)
:D
To easy :D
I waant onee noooooooow!! yummyy
U COULD ALSO USE MELTED CHOCOLATE AND A STICK FOR DIPPIN' IN.  MAYBE SOME ICE CREAM TOPPING WOULD DO THE TRICK.
Can I send you my favourite recipe? *-*
That's a myth :P
Please someone help me... I want to bake this too, but since I just know gram-measurements this whole cup thing confuses me... I tried to look up how much a cup would be in grams, but every page says something different. Is one cup a special weight (eg 100g) or is every weight different (1 cup of peanut butter vs 1 cup of oats)? Thanks in advance :)
Doesn't look as yum as usual..
My mom used to make something similar to these.
Pink is slimming on you.
dude I love you so so so much
Can you use nutella? :D
No.....no...just no...
You need to make more 3 ingredient videos. These are awesome!!!
LOVE the new logo dude!  I know a couple who made Parmesan spinach balls. Maybe try this as a savory dish. :)
LOVE IT! at uni so must try this :3
Nutella, but dont abuse it :p
I really need to try this D: :D!
D you buy cage eggs or free range eggs
Fat....Just Kiddin
اللي مع اللوز شوفان صح ؟
What's a good alternative to use  instead of peanut butter?
why are you in Pink something on your body? do you have fever?
is there anything this guy doesnt like to eat?
I just made a grain free peanut free version of that (for people with grain and peanut allergies) we don't have almond butter in Egypt so i made a scoop of almond butter from 125 grams of almonds by processing them until it became butter then i added salt.. then instead of the oats.. i used one whole banana .. and I processed it.. then i rolled them into nesquick chocolate powder.. it's cooling in the fridge now.. hope it comes out well :)
Don't think you can go wrong with pb and chocolate :-)
Whats with the blanket ? :P
Takes a real man to wear pink.
When you said you can start eating like there's no tomorrow I was thinking of the Selena Gomez song Live like there's no tomorrow

When we made them we always used rice crispys instead of oats and roll them in powdered sugar :D

Coconut would have been better than oats.
i like it when my balls are just chocolate..

Is it sweetened or unsweetened cocoa?
I just made then about 30 minutes ago and I love them!

I would add hot chocolate powder because the coco may be too bitter but other than that I will totally make this :)
Mmm
Wouldn't it be bitter'bc of the cocoa?
Watz with the blanket?
LOL the faces you make when you eat the food always make me laugh.
