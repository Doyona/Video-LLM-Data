How to crochet a advanced beginner scarf
Good one Easy And Looking Nice and Neat
Gorgeous crunch shell stitch scarf.  Thank you dearly for sharing.
Thanks for the tutorial.  The scarf came out really beautiful
Hi there, I'm super new to crocheting and I'm having a lot of trouble getting past the second row. How do you start the 3rd row because I keep getting all messed up edges by starting in the 4th st from the hook... its slanting and not staying straight.
Lovely tutorial!! Really miss them. Please continue to post video tutorials. Thanks
I actually came across this video some time ago and saved it in my Favorites because although I'm an experienced crocheter, it is a lovely simple pattern that I can refer back to when I need it.  Thank you.
Boring... not need to watch you doing shell by shell 😒
love it am going to make one for myself. thank you for sharing.
I miss your videos.
Thank you for the tutorial! i really like the look of this stitch
Really pretty, very easy to understand, thank you.

Love it. Thank you. Ive started a baby afgan,in this stitch. In random stripes of misty green, charcoal gray and light gray. Coming along real nice. Having another grand baby in December. Thank you,again.
This is gorgeous, how many chains for the pattern or does this work with odd and even multiples?

Thank you Heather for sharing excellent tutorial  ♥  Looking forward to making.
Beautiful
Hi Heather , this stitch is great I love it . I'm using it to make a baby blanket and I'm using a k hook , have you changed color using this stitch ? How does it look if you have ! Thanks again . I just discovered your videos and I love them
thank you! nicely explained, quite simple yet elegant stitch
Row 2 is so blurry!
I love this stitch!!! Thanks for sharing it.  Now my favorite! :)
Help I can't find pattern on here
which number hook are you using
The first thing I noticed was your hands. They look just like mine. Seriously! The veins on the back of my hands kind of sticks out like yours. I can even see my veins on my thumb knuckle. I also have a dot on my left hand, between the first finger and thumb. My dot is actually a tattoo I got in high school. All of the 'cool' kids that liked z-rock have them. I have always had really long nails that were at least an inch past my finger tip. Anyhow, just thought you would get a smile from all this knowing that some crazy old hippy has hands just like you. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
Really enjoyed the video and love the pattern. You speak so gently and clearly. I appreciate that you talked slow enough to follow easily. You explained it so well. My only problem is there was no info as to where to get the written pattern and I have no idea how do finish off the last row. Help.
looking for a  new sitch and love this one. Thank you so much.
Love this stitch and I agree....it would look great in a blanket
I love this pattern. it's great for beginners, it teaches the 3 basic stitches.
very nice!
Thank you for this lovely but easy pattern will try a baby blanket in this stitch. I did a single blanket in brick stitch from your video it turned out lovely my sister was delighted with it.Your instructions are very easy to follow thank you for all the videos. I am in Northern Ireland and went back to crochet as a pastime when my husband died a few years ago once again thank you. Your voice is very calm and easy to hear.
beautiful stitch  .. thanks for sharing 🌹
This looks so pretty!
