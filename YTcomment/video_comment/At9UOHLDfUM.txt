Just tried this dish and it was amazing
This was AMAZING!!
I did this dish and is so delicious! Thank you for your recipe 👍
Do you have to add aluminum foil ? or is that not needed ?
Why are u black....
why does no one do spice measurements☹️
A few notes here:  a) Use a good paprika, and not the brownish cheap one. b) I followed the exact instructions, and somehow the mixture wasn't as liquid as the one we see in the video. c) COOKING TIME: Make sure to check at 40 min. because it may be way overcook at 1h15 min. (don't forget that some potatoes cook faster than others). So start checking at 45-45 min. d) make a larger quantity of marinade ;)
I made this again after so long and i was lazy so i did with whole chicken and popped the whole bird in my airfryer with potatoes underneath. Super quick and still came out yummy 🤤
That looks delicious, I will certainly try this. I love simple dishes like this.
Wow that looks delicious and incredible.. thank You for sharing 👍👍😋❤
This looks like a 🏆 winner I'm trying it today👍 Thanks for sharing 😊 I just subscribed😏 Can't wait to try the ribs😋

Sugar and mustard! This chicken must be so delicious 😋
She's still the best
Where is recipe!!!
425 1hr
From the look of the ingredients you look to be using more than what you posted unless it just looks different on video
Do we cook it that long even for chicken breast?

I just made this dish and had to make due with what Ingredients I had. I only had 3 potatoes so I added 7 large cut up carrots and an orange bell pepper Jillian cut to fill in the dish. Also,  only  had a lime  on hand for the marinade and it was fabulous even with improvising. I sprinkled it with scallions as I didn’t have parsley lol gotta make it work 🤣
I tried this recipe today, let me tell you,  my family loved it!! Thank you so much for your delicious easy recipes!!
looks so good.cant wait to try
Wow this turned out amazing and so simple.I watched your video earlier today and decided to give it a try. Had my parents over for dinner and what a hit. The flavours are amazing thank youse sooooo much happy thanksgiving
Being as chicken is the only meat I can afford to buy these days I've been looking for new ways to make it. I've done a few of yours. No complaints so far. Sustainable and affordable. Thank you.
Thank you SO much.
Tried it today turned out very delicious  Will do again Thanks 😊
Hi there , am from Sri Lanka and am very happy to tell you that I made this recipe for my family today and it turned out so amazing and the taste was sooooooo marvellous. Thank you so much for sharing this. Keep your good work, much love from Sri Lanka ❤️❤️❤️
looks great
I’m making this tonight :) I wish I could have made this for the women I loved… she’s gone now:
Very nice Chicken I like it😋
Claudia how long can I leave the chicken in this marinade. Whats the longest ? Thanks so much!
I made this and forgot the Dijon mustard(AHHH). But it was still so delicious, I loved it! I added garlic powder and paprika on the potatoes🥰 but now I’m making it again today, gonna do it right this time. Thanks for sharing❤️❤️
I will try it. Interesting.
Wow!! This looks so good!! 😊 I have to try to make this one day! Thank you for teaching the world how to make this amazing dish! Keep up the great work!! 😇🙏
🙌🏾🤸🏽‍♂️I enjoyed it
CLAUDIA, CLAUDIA, CLAUDIA!!!  I made this recipe for my anniversary.  This was so flavorful, so easy, and you best believe, I WILL be making it again.  I, however, varied it in two degrees...I used orange juice in the marinade and I actually boiled the potatoes for 10 minutes, removed them from the heated water, let them cool, and then continued on with the recipe.  Everything came out tender, done, and succulent.  It was truly delicious!!!  Thank you.  You are a wonderful cook.
I love your videos soooo much!!!!! 😍😍😍😋😋😋😋😋 I have a question!! So, can the Dijon mustard be substituted with regular mustard for this recipe?
Seriously one of the best-tasting dishes I've ever made. Thanks so much for your clear demonstration!
This marinade and chicken look delicious! I made it with chicken breast instead and it was so yummy! Thank you for your recipes! 😁
I made this it was soooo good ! My hubby loved it. His favorite part was the potatoes
I made this last night beautiful thanks
My kind of cooking....looks so good too!
REALLY love the ***(COLOR)****, of the CHICKEN!!!
Looks yummy. Love your seasoning mixture.
Where can I find the measurements for the spices?
Mmm yummy! I'm excited to try this recipe!
awesome
Can I use chicken breast for this ?
This is going to be my New Year’s Eve dinner tonight with my family at home. Thank you for the marinade it smells yummy. Still marinating in the fridge while I prep the potatoes but I know it’s going to be good already. Thanks for posting this!!!
You look amazing ...
This definitely was very good..I just made it for my family for Christmas dinner but just tripled the recipe 😋
Love your recipe.
Can you use white sugar please answer
I tried this again not skipping any ingredients (except thyme). Even squeezed my own orange juice and added orange zest. It came out delicious! Ate with rice bcs i’m super asian lol. Thanks!
This looks amazing. Thank you.
Gooood lord, I just tried this recipe and was blown away. Made an instant subscriber out of me!
THIS WAS LITERALLY THE BEST MEAL I’VE EVER MADE !!!😍😍😍
I made this recipe today and it was amazing!  I just have a quick question.  I made all chicken thighs and let them marinate over night.  After cooking them, the skin was soggy and wet. I probably should have turned them or drain some of the oil/juices;  but I notice you did do any of this in your video.  Is there anything I could've done differently?  Please let me know, thanks!
Absolutely beautiful! 🌹
Where can I find recipe?
Badass marinade!
Oh wow... This recipe looks SO good. Im going to try it... I know ill love it already!
Question: Do you bake using just the grill at the top of the oven or just the one at the bottom, or both on simultaneously?
Wonderful recipe.. Made this for the family last night they loved it! Didn't have thyme so I substituted with basil. Delicious!!!
Wow just watching it makes my mouth watery already hmmm definitely I will try to make it thanks for sharing
Wow! this recipe is a real winner! I'll make it for my birthday. Thank you Claudia.
Yay! Can’t wait to taste!! Just about to put this in the oven !! I just didn’t have paprika.. but shall see how it taste. But I’m pretty sure it’s going to taste AMAZING!! Thanks again for your seasoned recipes!! Especially during this time of quarantining😃😋❤️❤️❤️❤️
This looks so good. I'm excited to try this out
SO making this during quarantine! Thanks so much, Claudia! PLEASE MORE SUCH ONE PAN OVEN CHICKEN AND POTATOES RECIPES! You're beautiful, both inside and out.
tried this today! so so good, thank you so much for sharing!
Going to try this dish
Thanx a lot excellent recipe I was searching a good roast recipe  since long time then I found yours and Voila!  I added courgettes carrots capsicum  and broccoli also  turned out to be family favourite.😋
This looks delicious!
I'm in love!
Wonderful dish, however, I wish the recipe would have included all the steps instead of only ingredients.  The cooks need to be willing to share all of the steps of their recipes.  Sale of cookbooks will happen if one makes successful recipes from a particular cook.  Great dish!
Fantastic! This was so simple to make and full of popping flavors! I will make again soon. Thank you so much for sharing :)
I made this yesterday, loved it. Recipe goes to my favorite recipe playlist😀
Thx sisi i like  your resepi

would classic yellow mustard work too?

Yummy, I am your new subscriber now.
The cooking directions are not in the notes with the recipe. Or I’m blind, which could very well be! ;)
Delicious!
Awesome recipe...Good Job...
Hi Claudia! How much salt and pepper do you use to season the chicken? Thanks
Seriously so good yummy

Hi Claudia, What kind of camera equipment do you use? Love your videos!
Made this for a family gathering a few weeks ago, it was amazing, so many compliments. Making it for a quick family meal tonight also, thank you for the recipe idea :D ....
Tried it and wow it came out perfectly. I just wish there where measurements for the salt and pepper
It looks yummy!   How much salt do you put for marinating the chicken?  Looks like 20g?  40g?   I can't tell :(   Thank you!
Can I do chicken breast instead?
Man.... that seriously looks good...
So glad I found your channel  I love to cook😊 This Sunday dinner 🍲
I wasnt expecting much from this recipe as I found ingredients to be very less and I didn't have time to marinate it even for half an hour. So I just literally mixed everything and popped it into the oven...expecting a bland roast. But OMG it was super super awesome.  Full of flavours . Highly recommended. Just subscribed ur channel
Ooooh... that finger position when slicing though!  Yikes.
Im in LOVE
Where I can  find the recipe Claudia new subscriber and noted to have lots of excellent comments.
Just made it. It was delicious. My kids loved it and they're very picky. Great recipe 👍
Just had this for dinner it was delicious
Love your recipe
The 4th recipe I've done and I'm currently waiting on it while in the oven!!!
Yes, such a good recipe....after seeing this demonstration, I plan to serve it to friends --  It appears I can make more if I want.  Thank you. Joyce in Sunny Florida.
I’m trying this tonight.
Hi Claudia, I tried this recipe today. Well, sort off since I didn't have all the ingredients and had to substitute some of them. It still came out absolutely delicious and I'll be doing it again! Thank you so much! Best wishes and God bless :)
making this dish again, all your recipes i try are delicious😘 stay bless
I need to make this one day your a great teacher god bless you ❤️❤️😋
I’m definitely trying this tomorrow 😋
Do I have to adjust the time if I’m cooking it with chicken breasts?
Thank u for your hard work please keep up the good work
I'm gonna make this tonight, and from I read in the comments I'm gonna have to quadruple it lol.
Looks yummy!!! 💚 I'll have to try it.😊
What if I already remove the skin? 😭😭
I just made it but have to admit that in the end there was 1cm of oil at the bottom of pot, so potatoes were oily. Maybe I put too much olive oil - I dont know how much 1 cup olive oil is in grams. Can you specify how much?
that is a LOT of salt!! looks tasty though
That marinade looked amazing! The finished meal looked like chicken lover's heaven! Can't wait to try this recipe! Have a great one!
Awwwsome
Fantastic i replaced with asparagus
I just tried this Claudia , it was amazing,  thanks for the recipe.
Gm Claudia This looks delicious I will try this recipe Ty for sharing I'm try to find you On Facebook can't find you
Making it as We Speak !!!
I have it in the oven right now!!👍👍👍👍
Marinade smelled soooo good. I just made this today. Thank you, Claudia
Amazing dish ! 🙌🏻😍 My father comes over to visit me every Tuesday so I love making different meals and desserts for him to try...I came across your recipe, bought all the ingredients a day before. It was so easy to prep and make. My father could not stop raving about it. He was in love 😍 with this 🍗 chicken dish. Very delicious. Thank you so much ! 🙏🏻
Im late but my question is do i have to add butter? And can i eat this if im on a diet
Claudia!!! I making this again and I've ran out is the ingredients once again lol. I don't have brown sugar  , no Dijon, but I will substitute for honey mustard, finally bought smoked paprika.Will put everything else in there!I know this will be good
That thumbnail though🤤
It only took 45 minutes total for my 8 chicken thighs and 8 baby red potatoes quartered to cook. I cooked it on the bottom middle rack the whole time. I can't imagine it taking an hour and 20 minutes. I would highly suggest people to check this dish much sooner than that!
hello claudia... I m going to make this today evening...I need to ask if I use big pieces of chicken (I.e 4 pieces of 1chickenwhole chicken) do the cooking tym vary?secondly shud I only cook it in upper heat of oven or upper n lower both heats?  plz reply fast
I made this tonight it was delicious 😋
I have a question what flavor is it what I mean is like is it spicy or is it sweet cause my family loves neither of them
So I'm usually nervous about baking chicken but this recipe was simple and delicious. Thanks for posting 😄
Claudia how much salt you added? I have no clue how much salt too add and I'm scared I might add too much
Wassup with the dislikes tho🤔 ?
Food porn🤤🤤🤤
Thanks for sharing I'm making this today
Another video and another great dish! I just wanted to grab the food from the video and eat it. Great job!
I made it and it was super delicious thank you very much😋
My chicken and vegetables came out soggy on one side, as it was sitting in a pool of grease. Any suggestions? Beside that the flavour was on-point! TY for the recipe!
Hello Claudia i made this for dinner today and it was so delicious my husband loved it. Thanks again for sharing!😊
This is gonna be  our dinner  tonight
You favor Chrissy Teigen

Looks so delicious! I only have russet potatoes on hand. Do u think they would work with this dish and should I alter the cooking time?
You're just a fantastic, very professional
Well doing this receipe! Got it in the Oven 😎 Hope it turns out good? DIDN'T measure anything went by eye? Gulp Thx for this receipe!!!
Gordon Ramsay who?
ok
This is extremely similar to Laura Vitale's recipe.  The only addition is the melted butter, and mandarin used instead of lemon.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBUhV6KoAPw&t=76s
I'm definitely going to try this , looks so yummy . Can't wait ....
Making it now! The marinade smells so good Im tryin not to eat the chicken before it cooked 😂
This recipe looks amazing and so convenient! I was freaking out on what to make for a family potluck and I will definitely try this one! & I will definitely be subscribing :)
YOUR AMAZING
Me & my family have been enjoying ur recipes 😁
I wish my girlfriend cooked like you do😒
This was seriously some of the most delicious shit I have ever tasted.  I added baby carrots to it, they came out perfect too. My only problem was I should have made twice as much because we destroyed this! :)
Is it ok to use regular white sugar if you dont have brown sugar?
Wow, this looks crazy good! Gonna have to make this, and it looks easy!
This looks amazing Claudia, i will be cooking this later, i do not have Dijon mustard, can i use English mustard instead?
What is the recipe
Mouthwatering here! If I were to make it with chicken breasts would it still come out juicy?
Claudia how long have you been Cooking?. Your Food looks "Delicious"🙌
awesome, thank you for sharing
I tried this it was good, didn't have brown sugar so that part was omitted and i also made the grill chicken alfredo with vegetables(oh my many times,even at my one yr olds birthday party, a full foil bowl) all was gone. My friends want the recipe too. I use the alfredo sauce instead of the whole milk n parmesan cheese. Thanks beautiful and God bless 😍
Oooh that looks very good.
Dear Claudia, amazing, and congratulations on a beautifully made, professional piece of work, all in sharp focus and crisply edited—your team are TV grade but the fact you take the time to come back and engage with, and encourage, your many fans is what gives this a real sense of community ... YouTube can do what TV can't.
I've some chicken legs brined in zesty pickle juice. I was looking for a recipe to try with them, and came across yours. I will update how it turns out. Subscribed. 😊
😍😍😍
comford foods channel
Can she hear her own voice? If she can, why is she still talking!?
Looks good
Wow! Have to make this version. Thank you!
I'm making this right now. Of course I had to improvise because I had no orange juice. I used a little lemon juice. I had no brown sugar so I used a little splenda because I don't use regular sugar either. It smells wonderful, I hope that with the change I made it still tastes great. Your dish of course looks wonderful!!!
I made this yesterday it turned out great... thank you so much
Thanks! This was good video. Your food looks delicious!😌🙏🌴
Why not bake potatoes for half an before the chicken. As potatoes take longer to bake? As per your suggestion in one of the other videos
Look delicious
Im liking the one pan recipies.
Making this chicken dish for myself! Chicken marinating for 1 hour already!I love the marinade ingredients...using only chicken thighs...if I love it I will bring it to a potluck sunday night!
Good recipe!
Just made this!!!! It's the bomb!!!

Turned out good
Delicious!💯
Hi im making it right now what if the sos doesnt really look whats in the video?? But u have the ingredients ?
Do you think some spiced sausage added to it as well would be nice?
👍👌😋
It sounds delicious , no doubt it's right, add some lemon wedges or juice in marinate could be a twist. Just personal preference, try it as well. Thanks for recipe
Hi there Claudia, I just subscribed to your channel. This dish looks amazing and I can't wait to make it for family and friends. Thank you for sharing the recipe.
Yummy recipes 😋+ voice  so soothing= new sub. ❤
OMG you are an amazing cook, I love cooking with spices too also new to your channel
that voice though ... Music to my ears ... Makes me subscribe ...
Thed recipe was a HIT!!! Loved it. It was flavorful, simple and delicious. Thank You
How much salt and pepper did you use?
I am trying this recipe today, It marinating as I send this message. I will report back later as to how delicious it was. Than You.
Hi, Claudia! I just found your channel and subbed. I love your recipes!   I have a quick question though. I noticed that for some of your recipes, you use chicken with the skin on. My family doesn't eat with the skin on. So, can I still make it without the skin?
Yummy...I going to try this next
Oh my, my, my! I have been cooking for a very long time and never have I ever tasted something so yummy. I told my husband as we were eating the leftovers today that this is the best meal I have ever made. I added broccoli, snow peas, and asparagus for the last 10 minutes under broil like you did with the chicken breast in another video and Oh my, did this ever turn out delicious! Can't wait to invite friends over and make it again, I just know they'll love it too. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe with everyone. Much appreciated!!!
Trying for dinner tonight 😁💕
Hi, I had missed your cooking, happy you back,Vincent from Kenya
Claudia how are u ?looks so good .My guy is gonna get a kick out if this.
Claudia, you have taken cooking chicken n potatoes to another level. Honestly I thought the other chicken recipe looked yummy, but this one is 'Zeelicious' I just subscribe from Toronto:)
Great job!
I just tried sending  too you.
This looks amazing, I'm making this tonight for my family.
I just subscribed to her she is amazing I will always watch your videos and always like 💜👍🏻
Another amazing and easy looking dish. It's hard to come up with different chicken recipes so thanks again for sharing. I can't wait to try this!
wonderful
Omg!!! Its just ausom.... I gonna try it, god bless you dear.
Any sides ?
Claudia, I made it tonight, I added carrots (a couple of long ones cut in half), the dish was absolutely delicious, my husband said it was the best baked chicken dish he ever had and it came out of the oven looking exactly like your picture!! Out of sight! Thanks
This is amazeBALLS❤❤
Looks so great can't wait to make it tonight!!!!
I pass the recipes on cuz they are the stuff and I'm pescatarian now but Hunney, I still be salivating watching the meat recipes lmao 🤣😂
like this, thank you i will try.
You are an amazing chef!
you are so beautiful and awesome
Claudia, I made this with a slight modification. Since my oven wasn't working, I cooked it on the stove top and I only added 1/2 the paprika (since that's all I had). Since I didn't have thyme, I subbed in with rosemary. It's slightly a different dish, but it still turned out amazing! My guests and I devoured the chicken. It was so packed with flavor. Thank you Claudia for the delectable recipe!
Hello Claudia. I made this recipe and I ate like a pig 🐖. Hahahaha. How scrumptious dish. This is a Grand Slam in the kitchen. Thank you honey. God bless you. Ahhhhhhh, I forgot to tell you about your angelical 👼 hands. Again, thanks.  God bless you honey. I heart you 💓.
Wow !! Another great dish !! From the angel 😇 of cooking!! Can't wait to to make this !! Thank you dear! 😋👍
The marinade is just wonderful - love the citrus! The dish looks scrumptious! 😍💕
OMG, that marinade with mandarin is amazing! I love citrus fruit with chicken...adorable recipe as always <3
Hi Claudia, I literally just made this amazing recipe to your exact ingredients (which I don't normally do for recipes) and I have to tell you it turned out not only looking like your dish but was one of the best chicken meals my wife and I have ever had. Thanks so much for posting. I hope your subscribers try this awesome recipe. Look forward to trying more of your food. Well done.
I'm getting my seasoning together now, soooo excited! I know my family is going to devour it! Looks soooo good Ms Claudia God Bless You
Good Lord! I cannot think of anything that could make this dish better than the way you made it. Looks deeelish!
HI Claudia you say about 2 hrs for the chicken and potatoes ?I  can't wait to make this thanks
