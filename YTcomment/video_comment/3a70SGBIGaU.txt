do we need to blind bake first?
Looks like a soggy bottom!
Hi. I love your recipe. Question, do you have to blind bake the Pinecrest before you arrange it?
I love your idea of not having to pre bake the crust.  But what keeps the custard from not leaking out the holes you make with the fork? Thank you for an enjoyable video!  Paula
Surely the cheese should not be cheddar but a French cheese.I would have thought perhaps a gruyere....
What is the size of the dish pan? 9inch? Merci!
Perfect!  Thanks!
Normalement en lorraine on ne met pas de fromage dans une quiche lorraine
Hi is it not necessary to Blanc the dough in the oven with some weight? Thanks
Hi! Can we bake the crust before putting the filling? If so, for how long and at what temperature?
Try odlums quiche recipe
Just made this and waiting for it to cool down.Will be back to say if it's As good as it looks
I made it and it was AMAZING!  Thank you.
What kind of cheese is that
🙏🏻🌹🙏🏻
do you have to use cream I can't stomache it can't even look at it
Did he not bake crust a bit before adding mixture?!!
Très bien merci beaucoup pour cette recette 👌👌👍👍👍😊😊
Thank you! I love this recipe. It’s delicious.
How to make shortcrust pastry
my quiche crust turned out to be soggy, perhaps it should be blind baked first?
That pastry looked under cooked to me........I'm probably wrong but have a look at the piece he cut to eat...
Quick question: Should we bake the dough shell only a few minutes first, before we put the yummy ingredients,  to make sure the shell  is  well cooked.
This just told me how fatty this bill is it’s a wonder the French couldn’t even stand up after a meal after eating this with all the calories in it
Row pastry  nice  one
"bacon and cheese French style quiche"  Si vous arrêtez de dire quiche au fromage et aux lardon j'oublie tout ça s'arrête là, je vous laisserais tranquille, je ne vous poursuivrais pas, mais si vous ne dites pas quiche Lorraine je vous chercherais, je vous trouverais et je vous tuerais
Why can't you include American measurements?
I LOVE QUICHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Made this last evening and it was wonderful. I didn’t have enough Gruyère so I added 50 gm cheddar and it was just too “cheesy” for my taste but not bad at all. I substituted uncured ham for bacon because I can’t eat it. I added a little caramelized onion and it gave a sweetness to the savory custard. I used freshly grated nutmeg, organic cayenne and chives and it all made a very satisfying Sunday supper. Love your channel. 😄
Hi Stephan, I have been learning from you and using your recipes that are magnificent but also accessible. I have one question about this recipe which is do you think blind baking the crust is necessary? I have always used this method and am curious why you don't. Your presentations and clear explanations are brilliant and I particularly enjoy your version of duck a l'orange. Best wishes Peter.
I am so excited to give your crust and quiche recipe a go 😁🤞
I am French and I have never heard of cayenne pepper in Quiche Lorraine.
I can't help but notice that you don't pre-bake your base before adding ingredients. I assume this is just fine....?
You can see the bottom isn't cooked and soggy as you didn't blind bake
What the size of the baking dish please
Just perfect.  Used method for a shallot infused spinach, everything else as directed.  This recipe followed his potato leek soup & both meals followed the worst trip to a dentist ever, lol.  Stephane, your food is so good, it literally shot off much needed endorphins! Merci beaucoup👍!
I have a question, when I was in Paris, I had the best quiche ever at a restaurant on the Champs Élysées and they said most French people do not put cheese in their quiche, it is more an American staple. Is this true?
I woud make 4 eggs and 500 ml for better memorising. I eat with figs and goat cheese paprika and onion fried it was food of Olymp but french girls cooked with soya milk instead cream
Merci pour la recette. Cuisez-vous le bacon avant de l'enfourner? Merci;
It would be nice to have the recipe. Maybe update the link.
😇🍴 Pastry dough: Mix 225 grams flour (1 cup) and 100 grams butter (1/2 Cup) into breadcrumb consistency. Add a very small amount of milk (2 T and 1 Tsp), and knead that in. Cook Quiche Lorraine (heavy cream, eggs, bacon, gruyere cheese mixture in 425 F for 35 minutes.  Half a Bread Bowl Quiche Lorraine richly flavored with Gruyère cheese and smoky salmon then toasted.
How do I make  the dough please thanks in love  your cooking
Is cream whipping cream or half and half in America?
how are we supposed to bake the bottom of the crust just like the upper part?
Thanks you so much for this wonderful recipe!! My husband and I are literally eating it at the moment and waiting for the potato gratin in the oven as well ! It tasted absolutely delicious following your steps❤️❤️❤️ I made my own dough following your recipe and didn’t cut any corners! It’s a must try for sure !   Quick update! Just had the potato gratin and it was wonderful! Thank you ❤️👍
No need to bake the pastry first with beans on them before? I am confused
I made this and it came out watery- did I put in too much liquid? 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk??
amazing!
Perfect. Awesome and yummy!  Thanks Stephen.
Do u not blind bake before u put the filling in ? 🥰
Quiche should never be eaten hot, or fridge-cold. I think it is one of life's simplest pleasures to have a slice of lukewarm homemade quiche served with a tomato salad with a nice sharp homemade dressing (and keep the dressing simple).  Conversely, one of the worst things in a supermarket is a ready-made quiche which is what most people have tried first, which puts them off.
I think using hot sauce instead of cyanine pepper works better and gives a better flavor.
You didn’t blind bake the pastry… and the bottom looks soggy.
Dice the bacon This is a dish eaten with a fork
Merci pour cette easy recette.. et vous êtes beau
Silly question I think I know the answer to but do you not blind bake the pastry for this? Trying this today and it's my first time using shortcrust. I thought it needed to be blind baked before you used it
kiss Lorraine ...yes I would kiss  Lorraine again ..... !
cheese in quiche?????? never seen that before
1:49 Is it very OCD of me to fill the cream bottle with the milk right now to get the last bit of cream out? 😄 2:36 Quick mix cheese with bacon in the bowl and drop it in the pan. (I know this doesn't sound romantic).
Wait 30 to 45 minutes. Nooooooooooo 😭 So hungry
Hii, if I understood correctly you didn’t take the pastry to the oven before to pre-bake, right?
Made this recipe many times and must say it comes out perfect every time! Made it again for dinner tonight and it’s amazing 🤗 Use gruyere cheese 🧀 and it’s just fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe 👏
I made this earlier this morning, I followed your instruction implicitly it was beautiful when I removed it from the oven to cool, thank you for sharing, I am most grateful, Merci ^^
There is supposed to be more egg filling than the toppings that go in first. The egg filling should also be silky not all full of the rest of the ingredients. I lived in France I also made Quiche Lorraine for many of my college classes. That's not how it's supposed to look.
Why are you making a Quiche Lorraine witches from alsace-lorraine with cheddar cheese?? You also have great gobs of bacon and it should be sliced thinly.
Big fail on assembly, so sad.  Chop bacon, layer ingredients, and par bake the crust.
It makes me want to listen to the B52s
You don't need salt ,because bacon,cheese are very salty .This is to much cheese,very salty.  To much eggs and cream,milk,also to much  200 gr bacon. Very unhealthy and fat.
I  would sooo love to have your short crust pastry for your quiche recipe please. I  would be so grateful. m any thanks karen maslen
Quiche Lorraine is NOT made with cheese!!! That we call a quiche Savoyarde. Despite his French accent, this man hasn't got a clue about traditional French cuisine, as I learned from many others of his video's. He is a bussiness man rather than a cook. His lack of basic knowledge and ingredients is painful to watch! Please take a look at other sites on the internet for traditional French cuisine, there are plenty!
Making Quiche Lorraine today, Chef
I made the pie crust and in the fridge!  I just watched the quiche video to make tomorrow for a small group of ladies from church!  Your recipes are simple to make and I have made one quiche already.
1:08 But how do you make the f*cking dough?
Hello Stephen! read a book one time that said some of the French methodology for cooking derived from the Romans occupying France! I wonder what those would be?
Would I be committing a sin of sorts if I added caramelised onion with the cheese and bacon? 😅😁
I did not get the amount of milk & cream for the Quiche. Can you please tell me the amounts? Thank you
S'il vous plaît.
Vous a youtube Channel en Français ?
Thank you teacher. Love quiche
What's the size of your quiche pan?
i'm rewatching this again now to get the recipe right, I have just been out and got cream, milk, eggs. I'm going to make one using bacon, cheese, leeks and sun dried tomatoes. I can't wait. I've used your quiche recipe a few times now and it's a delight, so light and delicate and the cream gives it a divine flavour. Bravo the French!
Hello Stephane! Why didn't you pre-baked the crust? Thank you!
Stéphane, je l'ai fait plusieurs fois exactement comme le dit ta recette, sauf que j'utilise du fromage Comte. C'est parfait à chaque fois. Ignorez les critiques et les pleurnichards.
2 types of bacon ? milk & cream ? 2 eggs + 2 eggs yolks ? Nutmeg ? premium quality cheddar ?  Nah mate, not got all that in the cupboard. You Lost me at 'Simple'
I perforated the crust as instructed, and the custard leaked all over
Mais non!! Arretez avec le bacon!! A classic Lorraine is only chunks of ham!!!
Ugent. Please tell me if the bacon must be fried first, or used raw?
WTF! Cheese in the quiche Lorraine ! Paul bocuse must be spinning in his grave. T'a fumé la moquette ou quoi ?
`I've recently subscribed and your videos are wonderful, entertaining and easy to follow.  Keep up the good work, and please disregard the American morons.
Cheddar cheese?.. I would have thought gruyer, comte or swiss..
In Quiche we trust ♥ Greetings from France ! PS : dans ma version revisitée j'utilise des lardons, je mets quelques morceaux de tomates et du poivre par dessus pour parfumer
I made this today. Tasty, but my cheese and cream separated during the cook. Any ideas why? Love the channel and thanks for many recipe successes.
The bottom crust was raw.
Quiche Lorraine is a staple in French cuisine like croque madame.
you make french super easy.  To think I avoided french cooking all these years thinking it was super complex.  Thank you for making it easy to follow
Looks like shit.
I add sautéed onion and peppers and used duck eggs. Oh yeah
I’d use a metal flan tin for this - it conducts heat much better than a ceramic one.
I'm binge watching your channel, and I literally can't wait to learn how to actually make all these things properly. Going to have lots of happy friends and family haha
Obviously, cheddar is not French.  What kind of cheese do people use in France for a traditional quiche lorraine?
No leeks in it? I always use leeks. I also use something we call boston pastry here in sweden.
So I was dating this girl Lorraine, but in reality I liked another girl, Clearly. One day Lorraine and I had a falling out and we broke up.   I can see Clearly now, Lorraine is gone.
That bacons going to be soggy.  Also I would pre bake the crust a bit.
Hi, I am from India and completely new to French cooking. Could you tell me what else would go with the Quiche to complete the meal.
No leeks ?
Tried today and like every other recipe I tried of this channel, it was great:)
Absolutely looks delicious! What type of cheese is the best to use for Quiche?
This was the best quiche I have ever made.  Crust was perfect and flaky.  I look forward to trying more of your recipes.
i have one of these in the oven now, I'm incredibly happy to be able to make my own quiche. I wanted to start by trying the leek and onion recipe, but my supermarket was out of leeks, so I am making this but i added some caramlized shallots which i saw how to do on the beef bourguignon video. thanks for taking the time to make these videos!
Made it last night and it came out beautiful and delicious. I did let it sit over night which made it nice and firm, but juicy at the same time. Thank you!
your qu iche lorraine lovele Ilike it
looks beautiful, thanks for the recipe!
Just made this for my Husband's birthday breakfast this morning and is my third French meal, first from your channel! Superb my friend! We both loved it!
I saw a woman in Paris make this dish with a dough she purchased that was rolled in paper. She placed the dough, with the paper, into the tart pan and filled it with the ingredients. It was brilliant as the quiche didn’t stick to the pan and was easy to serve. Is this something you’ve seen? It seems so much easier. I would like to make your dough recipe and perhaps use paper to roll it out and place in the pan. Thanks.
why no onions ???
EDIT:  Hey, you skipped covering how to prepare the dough at 1:07.  I know how, but most people who watch these videos likely do not.  May I suggest adding it to your list for future vids ?  EDIT: You don't pre-bake your crust before adding the filling ?  Doesnt that result in a gummy crust ?  I've always pre-baked my crusts (shells) for quiche (not for other pies ... just quiche).  Method: line the shell with thin foil, dump in a pint of dry uncooked rice, and bake 20ish mins at 400F, remove the foil with rice, prick shell with fork, and bake another 5-10 mins, then brush with yolk, and bake another 2 mins until golden, then cool.  There are other methods, but that's the one I learned.
VARIANT: Just like pizza, quiche is friendly to a wide assortment of different flavors.  One of my favorites for quiche is roasted peppers and goat cheese (chevre).  The former are simply minced, but the trick for incorporating the soft goat cheese is to freeze it solid, and then box grate it (large holes) directly into the egg mixture, immediately before baking.  My other favorite is mushroom duxelles, crispy bacon, and sharp cheddar ... no special instructions needed there.  Warning: cooking quiche causes mild loss of testosterone, which I usually offset by spending a few hours surfing youtube for clips of old war movies, or playing with power tools.  It helps.  (j/k)
The word in English for poking holes in a pie crust is "docking." You "dock" the crust. It's the same verb -- "dock" -- as the one that means to tie a boat to a pier. Yes, English is a strange language.
I'm so sad for muslim peoples... they never know how it's wonderful...:-).
Thanks for the great recipe, I was wondering how big is the baking dish? Great channel just found it and I'm binge watching.
It's refreshing to see french recipes that are able to be produced in a home kitchen. Thanks chef - Having just found your channel I'll be watching plenty more videos :)
I would really like a French pecan pie recipe!
hello....love your channel and your presentation....regarding the recipe pls may i know if i can omit the bacon and if so what can i substitute for it....i do not consume either pork or beef..
I cooked this; without doubt 3 classes above any other quiche I have tried, thanks heaps.
Do you need to grease the dish before filling with the pastry?
We put spinach in it....sometimes leeks.  Great picnic food!
thank you. I try it and it was awesome. but I don't like emmental cheese after taste. Any other cheese suggestion please?
That is so much easier than I thought it would be. I adore quiche, will definitely be making one this weekend.
I can't wait to try this! French cooking is my favorite 🌺
Some recipes suggest to prebake the pastry before adding other ingredients. What is your opinion on that?
Magnifique!
Make a video about Baugette!
Bon soir french chef 😊 I made a quiche tonight for my evening meal with your recipe for short cut pastry. And it was so delicius!! Thank you very very much for sharing the recipies 😃👌🏼
Thank-you for doing these recipes. I get so tired of Italian and Mexican! Keep going!!!
Bonjour mon ami salut bu Brésil encore une fois. Le quiche Lorraine ois simply the best. Last week I asked you whether you were familiar with le tarte dijonnaise. I did a little research and found out that there are both tarte et quiche dijoinnaise. It seems there are some differences on how you assemble it but the basic ingredients are the same: páte brisèe, dijon, tomate et oignon. If you think it is appropriate what about preparing them for us? Thanks.
I live in Iraq and we don't have that cream in here,can I don't use it, if I made this recipe??  thank you 😃
The Quiche Lorraine was the dish that made me fall in love with French cuisine, first time I visited Paris. I remember eating this in a small pub close to Notre Dame, the pub was specialized in quiches. From savory to dessert ones, incredibly intimate atmosphere and chill out music in the background. Well, well well, looks like I know what I'm cooking this week ;). Merci!
Believe it or not; made the short crust pastry - by hand two days ago - to make a quiche lorraine today for Oscar Night. Your recipe could not be better timed and the Oscar for best quiche goes to... You! Merci Beaucoup.
Thanks for this yummi recipe. Definately going to try it out this week 😋
you have the most acurate description of bacon i have ever heard
Nice!
Early!
