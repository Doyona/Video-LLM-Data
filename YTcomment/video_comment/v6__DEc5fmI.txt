Love her work, she doesn't frighten people with scary nail techniques! Can she do more budget brands? UK 🇬🇧
What pen you use maa’m plz name
Is it better and easier to paint with pen,not with brush?
Wish you would have shown the start to finish of the longer nail.
Like the design. Not digging the ring finger.
I have the Calligraphy Pen, but I don't have the ink. Can I use Gel Polish or Laquer Polish, instead of the ink?
i respect the creativity but the uneven nail was so annoying to me I wanted to cut it off all the time xD
Your short nails are my long nails.
I know this is an older video... But wanted to mention how much some of these designs look like Henna tattoo designs.  If you want some interesting patterns just look up henna designs.  They can get quite intricate and beautiful.
Love this look!  I used black and matte clear and it turned out great!  Thanks Susie!  Love your channel 💗
awesome
When she starts to do the dots it sounds like the theme to Code Lyoko.
I think I'll have to try that, I'll finally have a use for that one sheer blue polish that I own
Absolutely LOVE this one too!!!!
I bet this sheer polish thing would work great with gel polish. It would level out the streaks and I wouldn't go grey messing with regular polish before it dries!
A lot of your designs would be beautiful matte with shiny designs.
The music just goes from really cheesy raver to porn music back to really cheesy stuff and im dyin hxc rn xD
very pretty
Why does the music sound like a porno
That edge nail shape is really growing on me 💙
did she just call decals "deckles"
I never even thought of using calligraphy pens for my nails thats f-ing genius
con que limpia la pluma, con acetona o alcohol? gracias With which clean the pen, with acetone or alcohol? Thank you
Please do more edged nail designs! Pretty please!
You know, it looks a lot like henna. Good job on the design and outcome. Thanks for the video.
Susie.  Love from Saskatchewan.   I'm just wondering where you got your blue light ball from.  I recall you have an orange one as well.  If you made it, can you point me in the right direction for instructions.   Hugs to you and camera man.
Would normal caligraphy ink work or does it have to be airbrush ink?
Would it be possible to do this design with gel polish?
lace nails so pretty
I love your videos
You know it's about to get real when she puts the glasses on. lol.
could you do the piece of lace like you explained? I'd love to see that!
Hmmm, I wonder if I could make my own sheer OPI nail envy color???
I'm making some sheer tonight!!
I started watching these vids  after Jenna Marbles mentioned how entertaining they were! And omg I'm down a wormhole Suzie! I've been watching you none stop for three days!!!
Can you  make a video of the acrylic lace inlay? Love your channel btw!! Can't stop watching your videos.
Your fantastic suzie I'm starting to teach myself acrylic and my friends have graciously offered to be my models ☺ your videos have taught me so much x
De Cals,   not deculs
How do you do this successfully with your left hand?
What is a deckel or deckle?
Where did you get that amazing pen from!  It's so nice 😊
i would love to see you do the lace inlay in one of these videos
Susie did you ever think about trying to put actual lace down on the nail then putting a gel on top like how you did the flowers with the acrylic & Gel overlay?
I wish I would have had a colligraphy pen a week ago, I did my friends nails for a wedding. The theme was burlap and lace! Great wedding design! I usually use my very tiny detailing brush but it can get difficult sometimes. Toothpicks work OK when hand drawing lace but your pen looks like it would be the best way! Love them!
Cool design 🤗
I bite my nails probably am going to go there
Is it ok if we mix clear gel and black gel color to create clear black?
What king of acrylic monomer do you like to use? Standard, low-odor, or odorless? And what is a get band of each to get as a student? Especially of odorless for my state broad test.
Can you use nail polish with a calligraphy pen or does it have to be calligraphy ink??
If you want some really good image references for lace designs, look up Irish lace, pineapple lace, and tatted lace. Vintage lace patterns have pretty cool looking ones too!
Those are short nails?  I would be thrilled to grow my nails that long!
I never had my nails done before, but I'd so travel to you to get them done! your amazing.
Hi Suzie, it's a marvelous video and nail art idea. I wonder if mixing super-frost (chrome) colour like silver or gold with clear nail polish will work? I would be great to have gold/silver sheer polish. It makes me think of thin silk!
Btw I have a that yellow dotting tool it's very pretty😍😂😄
😍😍😍😍😍😍😜😄😂💩
What paint do you use and where can I buy that paint pencil?
you kinda look like Valerie bertinelli. i love your channel! so amazing!
Putting a matte topcoat on this looks amazing!!
Ms Suzie keeping it real with that Tony Montana meets Martha Stewart sheer lace coke nail.
you are so beautiful you and your nail😍😍😍😍😍
Why 120 dislikes?
you can use an artist quality acrylic paint thinned to the consistency of milk with your calligraphy pen
When mixing the polishes for the sheer black, should they be the same brand?
I normally hate black sheer, but you make it look so sexy lol
Wow you are an artist! I thought you had used a stamper and when I opened the video I see how much this is great... its all handmade. Congrats!
Gorgeous and simply elegant
Gorgeous and simply elegant
You should do this in red
When I first saw the thumbnail I instantly thought…Starbucks, literally
Imagine she had matching black henna all over her hand that connected to the nail art design. I think that would be so cool 🙂
where did you get that pen from bc that will really help with the design I like to do
I love you and your nail you seem like such a genuine person
Hi Suzie! I was just wondering where you can purchase a calligraphy pen and how much do they cost? Also same thing with the ink you use with it. Thank you, and I love your videos! You're amazing at this! <3
is her ring finger naturally that long??. or acrylic ?
Who gives a shit about nails
your AMAZEING I keep practicing I wanna do nails just like u
What kind of ink should I buy for my pen I got something similar to yours please help
I wanted to ask. What do you think about sticking a fake plastic nail on a natural nail and putting acrylic on them both instead of using the little papera you use. I love in Puerto Rico so i dknt think that paper sticker kind of technjc is used here.
Susy  you are great!!! I follow you, thanks for the tips... I'm just beginning my career ☺ really happy  you have a fan here un Chile  hugs from Santiago de Chile!!!
Do you have a video on pieces of lace under a clean acrylic. I think that would be stunning for a wedding.
i have a talent show and i need a nail art that is light blue with pink flowers
plz show me how to do that shape on the long nail. It was beautiful and different 😍😍😍
How would you do it on your left hand? Also where did you get your calligraphy pen? Thanks!!
The music is always on point I want it 0-0
I like the lace, the small details, I remember i mixed couple colors myself to make it more "original" color :D it worked fine too :) and thanks for good advice and idea how to make nails even more amazing :)
how do you function with one long nail.
Where did u get they pen at

Why do you have a long nail?
Very beautiful 😍 could you please tell me what kind of brush is that?
+Nail Career Education Suze for starters you're magnificent in your work. I would love to be your nail model whenever you wanted to try out a new design. All of your work is gorgeous. I love your vidoes. I wish you were closer to where I live. I'd come to you to get my nails done for life. I love you Suzie!!!
that second to last nail!!!!
Where's the calligraphy pen and ink from?
can you do an aquarium nail?
I love them
Idk why but the ambience makes this looks like the entrance to heaven. like yeah okay welcome to heaven, congrats, help yourself out, i'm just trying this nail art design the humans seem to like.    on a serious note, wow it'd take me a looong time to do the drawings on the nails. But you did it like.. whoa. And you have a really soothing voice! I actually love to watch your vids before I go to sleep lol.
you're so fricking nice😊
can you do an aquarium nail art
Is the long nail an acrylic nail?
what happened to you nail remover pump?
Love the videos! Could you please do gel for beginners? Thanks!
Literally my only favourite nail artist on youtube
or another idea is making a video on how to remove polish properly from the nails 😊
you could a video giving tips for people with short nails, tips for how to take care of them or stop biting them Pleeease! 😞
this nail design is more organized than my future
Wow calligraphy pens for nail art is beautiful!!!!
Looks like henna nails Instead of lace but there nice ☺️☺️☺️
Pretty!
I really like that one long nail. Perfect for snorting cocaine!
could you maybe do a video on filling acrylic nails or maybe you favorite brands of acrylic powders?
Can you do aquarium nails?
thanks for all the great ideas. the longer nail reminded me of a horror movie, lol. I am so getting out my calligraphy pen. I have sever typs and lots of colors. yeaaaaaa thanks for the great ideas and I love the black color polish!
My nails are short and awful but I love to watch your videos. They are just so sweet and relaxing. Beautiful design.
Why aren't all of your nails one length
ΠΟΛΥ ΚΑΛΟ!!!!
Hey Suzie, I have a question about the acrylic liquid. I just started doing my own acrylic nails and I'm 16 years old. My mom was concerned about the odour harming me and now I'm concerned. The liquid I'm using is EMA not MMA based product. Are there any longterm negative effects of doing acrylics? I have anxiety and it's really bothering me. I hope to hear from you and your other fans on this matter soon. Thank you for reading!
OK...u & Cristine both pronounce "decals" the same!! so now I'm assuming you're in the Canadian region too?
looove the bangs...it frames ur face so well- very pretty & suiting...of course the nails go w/o saying...u never fail us sweetie!!a
yr amazing
ok thanks
sorry :[ !!!
eww i dont like your long nail !!!!
Could you do  a wedding nails 💍
very nise
WOW!!! Please, can you tell me what is the song name starting on 3:03?
Gorgeous, I love to watch you with your calligraphy pen the art is so beautiful xxoo
Hi,  You are from which country? I want to learn nail art professional course
What's with the long ringer finger nail????
I would love that as light pink sheer with white or even dark fuschia pink lace :). That was so relaxing to watch.  I used to get my nails done all the time and I would always go into la la land from it because it was so relaxing :)
At the risk of sounding dimwitted. Can you or have you done a video about tips to apply sheer polish? Every time I do it's streaky.
Your haaaiiirrrrr 😍😍😍😍
Can you do a video on how sculpt stiletto nails like the way you did them in your converting from stiletto to almond video ? I'm only 14 and watching your videos has taught me so much and made me want to become a nail tech.
You're hair's so gorgeous 😍
You're hair's so gorgeous 😍
I know this is weird, but I find your voice so calming... lol
A color gem would look great on accent nail too!
I love the look but that one long nail makes absolutely no sense..even nails are much nicer looking
Very Pretty design.
Gorgeoous! Going to try this with gel polish since it requires a thin layer maybe it will be sheer ^^ After these gels come off Ill try it, thanks for inspiring me!
I like the look of edge nails, but I can't get used to your edge nail being so much longer than the others. What do edge nails look like at shorter lengths? I am very curious even though it's unlikely I will ever get acrylics! They are so beautiful...
I love long nails but the 4th nail is way to long for me
Hi Suzie! Do u make ur own videos ? They are awsome.. :)
I really 💛 this look it's got such a vintage feel to it..Thank you for sharing.👍
Could you make a tutorial on how to do natural looking acrylic nails? :)
Could you by any chance do a video on how to keep gems etc stuck on I put some silver stars on my accent nail and on my right hand all but two out of the five I put on have stayed on left hand all staying on so far touch wood
Do you think you could do galaxy nails?
Saw your video of this design on NAILS magazine online!
You should do a compilation of wedding nail suggestions :)
easy
Hi suzie. could you do the one ball technic?
Stunning design Suzie TFS x May I just say your hair looks lovely xox
Your haircut is so cute! This nail art is really elegant and beautiful!
I wish you could do my nails xD
That interesting! I use this technical in my channel too, the effect is amazing, here in Brazil, the manicures already are using. Look: bit.ly/20ykXUq. Subscribe in my channel, I'm your fan
Is it okay for men to get their nails done? Because I was wondering, so I can get them done.
So pretty for valentines u could do shear pink with white lace 😄😄😄
I don't like it.
I am in love with your glasses. And you are such a talented drawer !
thanks
The hair.😍😍👌👌
lovely as always :)
I have a question?  You seem to favor acrylic over uv gel.  Do you think the uv light is dangerous and possible cancer causing as some dermatologists suggest?
Looks like a henna tattoo on your nail
Love the nails. And you're hair in this video is utter perfection!
Love it where do u got the pen and the paint ??? Please thank you!
Is it weird that when I watched this video I didn't move my whole body because I didn't want to mess you up 😂😂
I love your videos so so so much I was wondering if u could please change ur background music I like the music towards the end of the music but in the beginning I really don't like it I'm sorry I'm not trying to be rude I love ur vids so much
please could you do a video on how to use the forms on a rainbow colour nail please p.s I love your new hair and videos
Beautiful design. I had no idea that you could make sheer polish! What do you use to clean the calligraphy pen?

Suzie, you are such an insipiration. I recently qualified and also always looking for innovative ways of doing nails using different systems and keeping my clientele.. coming across your videos was ACAmazing!!! love it. from South Africa.
Can you perhaps create a video on how to place the lace under the acrylic?    I love your videos! it's very creative and educational at once. Thank you for all your effort!
That's so pretty!!😊 and would you please do a video about calligraphy pen?? I'm having trouble using it.
could you put a layer of real lace in between layers of acrylic?
I really find your videos helpful and relaxing...
Those nails would look amazing in matte
I love how calm and soothing, yet excited you appear in your videos! I can really feel your enthusiasm for nailart by watching your work :)
You love that edge nail don't you? Haha I love your hand drawn designs!
Love this! Where do you purchase the calligraphy pen & ink? :)

ı love you

Great video Susie, I love your instruction! This design looks great and so intricate!
there is an example of in-laid gel lace on naiouk channel. she uses real lace
Great nails!  I have been watching your videos for months now, and trying to figure out who you remind me of. I finally did! it's Valerie Bertinelli!
your hair looks great! can you do a video about the calligraphy pens? about the pens and ink, where you get those. and can you use polish or acrylic paint in place of the ink?
sheer white great idea
very chic :-)
Dear Susie  How do you remove your acrilic on your non dominate hand
That is really cool!! Can you mix clear coat with any color to make it sheer? 😋😊
Can you make a video on how to use Lace on acrilc

Valentine's Day Nails?
Suzie your hair looks so amazing love the curls
can you do a video on a ombre nail with the 3 colors of black,shearer black, and the shearer black k you use in this video with a matte topcoat

What if she did a summer nail design acrylic tutorial🤔
Cute bangs :3
where did u got the ink pen ???? plz let me knw....
I just can't find anything pretty on black sheer polish. It just looks dirty like smoker nails or something in my eyes 😟
I was thinking light pink and white as well! Two of my favourite combinations together. Love love love!
Where did you get your calligraphy pen? I've been looking for a nice one.
Where do you buy your material?
Love your hair! 💁🏽
Luv your work and appreciate your uniqueness. Watching your videos has helped me upped my nail game.😊 Thank-you for the uploads.
Well I love it but I wonder if you did use drugstore polish brand to mix it with the top coat
Sorry if someone has already asked this but is the ink literally just calligraphy ink for writing on paper? I've never seen this technique, it's amazing!!! So creative! You really take nails to the next level :)
Thanks
Thanks
Thanks
Beautiful design Suzie !! Love the bangs,they look really pretty on you:)) xoxo Aliza!!
LOVE IT and u look so Pretty with bangs lol, , , can you do a video on how to do nail strokes? I don't know how many there are.
Love your hair!
I love the sheer polish and design! Great idea! I am not a fan of the one long nail, but if it's your taste, so be it! :P
Lol I did a design on my accent nail and it was sparkly. My brother looked at it and asked me why I didn't do it on the middle finger instead. He said it would make more sense when you're flipping someone off😂🖕🏼
cool
Love your new hair style. Very youthful.  You are a very talented artist.  I wish I lived in your area.  Keep up the awesome videos.
Love your ideas and techniques. Also, I love your hair here. It always looks good lol 😊
You should do the lace in acrylic next! I really want to see that!
