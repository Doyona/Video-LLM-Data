Instead of making chocolate mousse, can I make nutella mousse? If I can, then can you pls tell me
Temperature of eggs
Can we use dark chocolate compound?
Hiiii there , can I use cocoa powder instead of dark chocolate and if I can how much should I put.
can we do this without the milk? cuz my dad drank all of it (its not a joke im being serious lol)
Not the best recipe in my opinion.  She added a splash of milk in the hot chocolate which solidified. Adding cold milk to a hot mixture is certainly not the way to go about it.  Wasted a whole dark chocolate for this recipe that I think is NOT to my liking!
Looks like an unbaked souffle
if she shut up this video would be great
When does the sugar enter the mixture
U forgot to use sugar in this recipe..🙄 then how I don't know
What about the sugar
Can I use coco power instead of chocolate
Was a success
She wasted so much time in the beginning n started at 1:03 n that was quite annoying
dis is the worst mousse ive seen so far
u r cute and funny specially the yummmmmy lol 😂
O..M..G! THAT LOOKS SOOOOOO GOOD OMG I WANNA HAVE IT SOOOOO BAD
love this vido
Don't lick your screen?  LOL <3

she finally started prepairing the chocolate mousse at 1:03
This is exactly the way my granny and mom always made it. Very few people I've met who follow this simple and efficient recipe. Thanks to op!
Wonderful recipe! It tastes so good!! Thanks a lot for sharing with us! By the way, do you think I could add flavorless gelatin to make it more consistent?
yum
Half of your video is just you gabbing nonstop in front of the camera about some bullshit. I thought this was suppose to be a recipe to make chocolate mousse
How many persons can eat this?
Hi! Is it possible to use melted dark chocolate compound for this? Thank you in advance!

can the dark chocolate replace with cocoa powder?
beautiful!!!
Thats the worst looking mousse ever Why does it look so hard
omfg.... i made two of these in this massive tin and ate it all, woops sorry family
will the egg smell?
will the egg smell?
I used chocolate syrup instead of melted chocolate. I just popped it in the freezer. will it come good??
I don't have electrical beater. Can you tell me how to do it without it?? Please do reply.
awsome....can i use whipped cream also??if yes then on which stage i can add that thank u ...u r awsome
If you folks is THAT affraid of raw eggs, then throw out all the mayonaise in your fridge ;)
can i use whipped cream instead of using egg whites
oh that seems nice and easy next time i get some choc i'll try it thanks for the straight forward instructions......cheers
"Don't lick your screen".  lol!!! :D
please reply, i really want to make this
where do we add the sugar??
you didint say anything about my sugar wtf my mousse is ruined it looks and taste like a monkeys sac.
its kind of dry i meen the choclot can i like put oil or something in it?
Thanks for the awesome recipe, it's so easy to make, I did it and I'm only 12 years old so anyone can do it ☺️
dont lick your screen DONT
nigella used marshmallow instead of egg white..
What is the white thing that you add in the chocolate ?
Wow
The final result looked kind of dry. I think you're definitely supposed to add butter (when melting the chocolate) and whipped heavy cream (after folding in the yolk) to make it a properly decadent mousse.
Is it okay to add gelatin?
Could I use 100g of chocolate
the egg white with pinch of salt is not successful..even i used mixer, it doest show fluppy or cloudylike form.
can i use normal eating chocolate (Cadbury) instead of dark chocolate?
How long would you reckon this last in the fridge?? I'm thinking of making a big batch but I'm hoping for leftovers for the rest of the week..
it yummy
Oh nvm it worked out hihi othet questionn is it possible to replace the dark chocolate with white chocolate??
Help When i added the milk the chocalte milj texture turned out hard nd clumpy...

Beautiful and easy  also going to  try on Christmas  Happy  Christmas to all

That looks crazy delicious! Nice!  Have a Merry Christmas and I will like to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ!  As most of you heard Jesus Christ is God incarnated, Jesus Christ descended from his throne to earth. By the power of his Holy Spirit he was borned of a virgin named Marry. Since Jesus was borned he was persecuted, as he grew up honoring and loving our Father in heaven he taught his chosen people the Gospel of Salvation, Jesus Christ healed the sick, let the blind see, mute speak, the dead brought back to life and the possessed free from demons.  As Jesus Christ finished spreading the word he was taken by his own people to be killed because they thought Jesus was just a men because his father by 'Law" not blood they knew and asked themselves how can he be God if we know his family.  So they wanted to kill Jesus Christ for Blasphemy even after Jesus Christ doing all the good works, the Jews elders back then did not like the truth and wanted him dead. They did not want to give up their traditions and religions, they loved to honor themselves as high priests and Scribes of the law but they could not even follow their own laws but preached them anyways. So Jesus Christ was sent before Pilate of Rome, innocent of any crimes Jesus Christ was delivered to him and the people wanted him crucified even after Pilate wanted to se him free, but the people wanted him dead which was all part of Jesus Christ plan of salvation.  Jesus left hand and right hand were nailed to the cross, his right hand on the right of the cross and his left hand on the left the cross, then his feet were stacked together a nailed pierced through them both and from this nails hung his body as it was set upward. After Jesus Christ died on the Cross 3 days later he resurrected from the grave as promised and as a sign to show all that followed him that he was God and that he has conquered the grave. The reason Jesus Christ had to die at the cross was to take the punishment of sin for all of humanity so that all who believe in Jesus Christ would be saved. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only begotten son so that all that believe in his name not perish but have eternal life and live in loving communion with God.  God Loves all of us and you need to seek him while you can still get resources, soon Jesus Christ will come back and before he comes back, getting the truth of Jesus Christ (the gospel) will be hard to get, you will be persecuted for trying to get it. Seek Jesus Christ and get to really know him! Read from book of John if you need a pointer!  May the Lord Jesus Christ bless all who read this and may their hearts hunger to get to know him! May Jesus Christ be Glorified when you see the truth that is HIm! Amen!  Merry Christmas and Happy New Years!
