is he stupid glowing sticks are not for eating???😬😠😡😡😤😠😬😤😡😤😡
Well it's too late for rob
don't eat the cupcake if you mixed it with that glow in the dark juice you'll get really sick
Ok the glow in the dark rice is cool and all, but why, just why would you do, yeah maybe it's fun, but whats the point exactly.
Did the glow in the dark jar, yes with the glow in the dark paint (I'm just going to go ahead and abrieviate glow in the dark to GITD, since it's so much simpler) and paint brushes, it looks really cool.
For all the people who are like you can't eat that your gonna die watch til the end
yes
It's toxic dumbass
Do a glow in the dark egg
You are not a post to eat a cupcake with glow in the dark juice

More Glow in the Dark
One time at a carnival thing when I was like 4 or 5 I bit a glow stick and it was fucking disgusting. Well duh, but the point of saying that was because I still remember what it tasted like for some reason. It tasted like chemicals and death. It barely got on my tongue so I didn't get sick, just traumatized
the fairy jars work with more glitter and more glow stick juice

Try rainbow cake!
I've visited the place where they make glow sticks. You couldn't of made the goo inside into a glow stick, because when you ate it (which you supposedly did) you would cut your mouth with the little shards of glass (that's what makes the cracking sound), and anyways that stuff is highly toxic.
When he photoshops his face on the little girls face in the Glow rice. HAHA
HE ATE GLOWSTICK JUICE FROSTING HOW IS HE ALIVE

Rob you could just add water to the mason jar then put the glow stick liquid and the glitter in and then seal the lid with superglue shake it and then it will be a fairy glass

for the glow in the dark fairy jar, putting glow stick fluid in baby oil actually makes it bubble and float, so yeah
For the fairy light jars, a quick way to do it is put the glow-in-the-dark stuff in a spray bottle and you spray it into the mason jar.

Aah, yes, the day of the 500,000. Now 2,000,000.
for the glow in the jar thing you take the little thin glow sticks and cut the top and hit it against the inside of the jar add some white glitter and your done. -BAD SIDE-  IT GOES OUT AFTER A FEW HOURS JUST LIKE NORMAL GLOWSTICKS.

your not doing the fairy jars right you have to buy thin glowsticks, cut them open and put that stuff into the jar (wear plastic gloves!) then shake, place it somewhere dark without a blacklight and taadaaa

I kept chanting "did he really" until the very end of the video... I was very concerned
i'm watching this much later, but i'm so disappointed with how lazy Rob has gotten.  i haven't yet caught up to 2015, but it's sad.  i went from helpful tutorials, to genuine how-to's and reviews, and then more and more i'm finding he's just using crude comedy to knock off a bunch of views and people are eating it up.  or just subscribed to argue in the comment section.  please tell me this gets better.  if you're going to use this as your livelihood, take the twenty to thirty minutes to make the dang icing.
LOVE THE RICE

Try the 3D Doodler!!
When are people going to freakin' realize the difference between "glow in the dark" and "black light sensitive"??? Anything that involves neon colors is simply black light stuff. Morons.

playing with dry rice is actually a really fun sensory experience especially for kids, so the glow in the dark rice which might appear pretty dumb and useless at first could actually be pretty cool.

Lol people are worried about rob, you guys shouldn't be yelling at them for being gullible. We make mistakes, and if rob actually ate the wrong cupcake then he'll just go to the hospital or something.
Your supposed to cut the end of the glow stick and bang it against the edge of the mason jar watch bunnie Claire's video for it
Uhhh... You didn't actually eat the cupcake with the glow stick stuff in it did you? Because glow sticks contain stuff like TCPO, which is toxic and carcinogenic...

I've been watching these vids for an hour and a half...this shit does work, one of my friends did it I can't remember the formula
Your not supposed to eat the frosting it has chemicals
He made one with green die and one with glow stick juice.He ate the one that has the green die in it.♡😐
Hi
I know😂 you just ate the one with the glow stick liquid😂
try glow in the dark cake mix
i think he really ait the one with the juice because on the other one the swirls looked more squished and green (like food coloring) and the one he ait was really neon (unlike most food coloring (just like glow sticks))
he didnt really eat it it was a  replica
What is robs Pinterest name? I can't find it

the jars actually work pretty well if you just break the glow stick a little and then shake it, no glitter needed :)
i just saw the end sry everyone😂
for the cupcake, didnt you get sick because the glow stick juice is totally toxic😂

Dangoutus
Lol guys I also commented thinking he ate the glow stick icing but he didn't just wait till the end
for the jar thing, I know what it said to do was wrong, but I did it before and it worked. I used thin glow sticks, cut them open, and took the glow stick and splatter it in the jar with different colors. it is hard and linger but it works
for the glow in the dark jar try using a different glow stick
Didn't they say that the stuff in the glow stuck is poison?

the fairy jars were stolen from another pin, for the real pin you use glow in the dark puff paint in whatever colors and put a bunch of dots on the inside of a jar, you can also add glitter to the inside of it if you want. The actual pin looks rlly nice.
I'm pretty sure glow in the dark juice isn't healthy /.\

WHY DOES NO ONE UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS JUST TRYING TO BE FUNNY AT THE END? Can no one take a joke anymore?!?!
For the fairy jar, I saw a tutorial where you break the glowsticks and wiggle them around in the jar so it like splatters on the inside

he didnt eat glowstick stuff and its not poisonous because once i drank some and got it in a open cut 6 years l8r im perfectly fine
Have you see this one? I'm a little skeptical. http://pinterest.com/pin/255579347580877371/?s=3&m=gmail
I know
Dont glow sticks have toxic in them?
Knowing me I'd try cooking the rice and eating it after I was done with the experiment.
Omg he ate the one with the glowstick
You should make homemade flubber!!💚
you guys are dumb the glowstick fluid is not TOXIC YOU WONT DIE IF YOU EAT OR TOUCH IT they are made for childeren they can put that in their mouth and it can broke do you really think this kind of toy would be accepted SERIOUSLY??!
Glow sticks are poison
the second .. using paint..dots.. actually works..LOL.. done it several times :)
So... If i buy a can of tonic water, some frosting and food coloring and mix it, i'll have a glowing in the dark frosting?
On the jar one you were supposed to get thin glow sticks and cut them in half and NOT just put the juice were supposed to put the open part in the jar while still holding it and then just shake the glow stick and then add glitter and shake it
Omgosh you okay and sorry but Lola
Lol at the bad choices part!
Do a melting crayon thing
The ending tho 😂
Glow in the dark bath thing
For the glow in the dark jar you're supposed to use glow in the dark puffy paint of some kind of glow paint!

The amount of people saying that he ate glowstick juice is ridiculous. When I was little, I used to eat alot of glowstick juice, but it doesnt look like im dead or sick. Either that or I have really strong acid (stomach acid) in my body or it's nontoxic
Bullshit
When I was little I didn't know what glow sticks were but I knew they made a cracking sound so I bit them and once i bit it too hard and I tasted glow stick fluid. Didn't think much of it till now.

Your supost to put glow in the dark fabric paint on a clear plastic sheet.Then you put that inside a jar.Cuts depend on the size of your jar.
Your doing it wrong
The thing with the tonic water really works... maybe try it out, before saying it's bullshit ;)
I'm pretty  sure the frosting was toxic
for the glow in the dark rice do u need a black light for it to glow or do u just play with it in the dark
To do the fairy jars you can also just take a skinny glow sick and poke a hole in it and shake it in the jar. My friend does that and it works. just a heads up
Do the homemade fluber!
fairy jars are made with glow in the dark puff paint and plastc

Hey Just letting you know that the glow in the dark Fairy Jars sorta work, it does not look exactly like the pin picture but we did several last year for kids to play with outside at night. We cut open the glow sticks, and poured the contents into a jar ( with the glass tube inside still intact). then added glitter and shook them up to break the glow stick tube and they made a decent lantern! lol

The "may or may not" defeats the entire purpose of the warning. I still don't know if should prepare because there "may or may not" be blood. That honestly and geniunely angered me, it's not cool to do that. You should tell us straight up, I can deal with it cause I don't have 'blood triggers' but I know other people who do. And they wouldn't watch this just because it "may or may not" have blood.

Friends ask me why I'm not on pinterest. This is why. So much b.s. to wade through to find an actual project with instructions that works. Thanks for this series. I watched all the Man v. Pin episodes in two days and I made the Glow Cloud the other day because of you. Your episodes make me laugh. Keep on being awesome. =)
For the Jar you use glow in the dark paint and your paint inside or outside the jar
Rainbow Soap Foam — Directions; — In a bowl, add 2 Tbsp of dish soap and 1/4 cup of water. Add food coloring or Colorations Liquid Watercolors (we used Liquid Watercolors here) to the mix if desired. Mix on the highest possible setting for 1-2 minutes. Your foam should be able to form stiff peaks that hold their shape. Scoop it out into your container and repeat as necessary until you have the desired amount of foam!
Get a cloth and put it in the oven for 1 minute and dy it and then put it in the freezer you'll get a hard glowing ball

I like the video's but i feel like some of the pins he has tried and they didn,t work was because he he didn,t do them correctly, No disrespect at all the vids are skill rad tho.
You seriously picked the most unnecessarily difficult glow frosting recipe ever. Look up mycupcakeaddiction's video on it, it seriously takes like maybe five ingredients and a stand mixer
I'm made that glow in the dark fairy jar by painting the dots, and it is time consuming, but it looks really cool
Did he really ate the cupcake?
Isn't that glow stick crap that he ate toxic
LAWL ... I was wondering about that glowstick Cupcake XD ... cuz I am preeeeetty sure its actually toxic to eat x.X ...
I don't think you are supposed to eat the muffins...

Glwstick juice is toxic
Pleeassseeeee reply. It would make my day :)
I love man vs pin I've noticed 99.9% of Pinterest is bullshit
Is that not dangerous to eat this cupcakes with glowing stick products? Is that not crazy chemical?
It always excite me whenever i see you uploaded. ThreadBanger is just so cool!
I don't think that cupcake you made is eatable... Thanks for the disclamour
I felt like throwing up just thinking about cupcakes and glow sticks, gag gag
I suggested the frosting 😂
Hours of entertainment with the glowing rice!
To get the glow jar effect, you flick the glow stick inside the jar to get the splatter effect, without having to paint each individual dot on. Hope this helps!
Eating what's inside a glow stick, isn't good.
The glowstick jar is possible, lots of youtubers have done it
ROFL I love the new disclaimer, really it should read for those who are too overly sensitive please watch with eyes closed.
You should make glow in the dark jars
Well done on 500,000 subs! You guys deserve it💎🙊✌️
Oh god i got really worried there for a second
Been watching this channel for 4 years and it's getting better and better😂😂
I loved the video!
Where did you buy the glow in the dark paint... Lol i want it so bad :-)
Oh honey, you can't eat the cupcake
http://pinterest.com/pin/487022147178063138/.   Or this
Uh oh glow sticks are pois
http://pinterest.com/pin/487022147178127396/ try it
when you ate the cupcake with the glow stick frosting.. I passed out!(jk)
Haha the Joke at the end was awesome xD
I don't have the link but could you do a glow in the dark bath water or DIY bouncy balls
That neon rice thing,, is freaking awesome!!!
Try this http://www.pinterest.com/pin/392446555002759591/
After eating that cupcake at least u will poop neon green poop :D
U should have done the crayon melting on pumpkin
I almost died at the end of the video. cause of the glowstick frosting thing.  omg.
OH SH*T. You are such a fool. You didn't know the liquid in the last part of your video is highly toxic... but who cares.
Diy lava lamp  http://fr.pinterest.com/pin/531354456010150131/  Try out this one !! :-)
I need that glowing rice in my life. But I seriously fell for the cupcake thing, don't scare us like that!
the disclaimer is so considerate
DON'T DO THAT TO ME ROB, I'M DRUNK!!!!
Who suggested the glow in the dark icing cuz I know that I did but I don't know if anyone else did
I watch your videos knowing I will never attempt to make anything on your channel. I enjoy your videos nevertheless :)
When u ate the cupcake i flipped my shit and shouted omg rob noooooooo don't die i won't br able to live anymore!
With the glow stick cut it and hold it just into the jar and shake! But no hate cause you would not have known, good luck!
In the fairy jar he could've just gotten a thin glow stick cut it and just flick it everywhere in the jar and doesn't  the liquid in glow sticks  have tiny glass shards in them?
I was prepared to be really concerned if he ate the glow stick frosting... Haha
I love watching your man vs pin videos
oh never mind...
u did the ''fairy jar'' wrong. there is videos how to do that xD aaand it works. just letting you know :p
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/53409945554585264/ http://www.growingajeweledrose.com/2012/05/glowing-bath-play-ideas.html Please do dis
I wonder if you can die from eating/drinking the juice from glow stick well if he doesn't post anything in a while we all know what happened.
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/360147301425538302/  do this please. I really want to be in the video. If I am, I will be your best friend.

The rice thingy is cool ! I thought you really ate the glow in the dark cupcakes 😂
Thanks for all of the fantastic Halloween costumes. Was the Ice Bucket Challenge this year and last year was Sharknado. Haven't won my schools contest yet but I always get great compliments from my friends. Also this video is rad.
What? No blood

Congrats on 500,000 subs you deserve them always looking forward to your videos! :)
The glowstick its supposed to be toxic isnt it?
Is that safe but really f*ck safety
Um, isn't glow stick juice toxic?
Càn you can do more please
Oh my god did someone really just find something "wrong" with this video about the glow stick cupcake joke. Jesus Christ. People, I swear.
Dont eat glowstickk
I almost flipped when you were eating the cupcake....

Umm btw why are you always bloody?
Nice👍

I dont think its healthy to eat glowstick juice😂😂
Rob please don't eat that stuff it's not good for you. I know you love your subscribers but I don't want you to get sick from all those bad chemicals.
Try the mason jar prism light!🙈☺️
Bro, that shit's toxic.
Seems a bit risky to do that glowslick joke at the end. What if some kid watches this video and doesn't watch it until the very end and drinks glowstick juice? I paused the video just before the reveal (I thought the video was over and I pause while I read comments so the autoplay doesn't change videos on me) and only knew to go back and watch the end because I caught a comment that talked about it. Hopefully if someone doesn't watch past the conclusion summary and drinks that stuff it's not too dangerous a substance. I get the joke, and I think it's funny, but don't you think it's a bit risky? Maybe I'm just paranoid. Anyways, thanks for the great info as usual.
Do more man and Carrie vs pin pls
My brother keeps trying to convince me glow stick juice is non-toxic -_-
So did you actually ate the glow stick juice cupcake? Or did you not?
Hahaha lol u ate GLOWSTICK
that jacket is so sick though where did you get it
I won't lie, I'm sad Halloween is over because we wont get anymore Halloween threadbanger videos until next year. :( You two always do such a good job!
Did you just eat glow stick juice wtf
This is like my favourite channel right now =3 so funny and it's just so addicting🙈 I'm going through the playlist for the 2nd time!
Lmfao love the videos! Congrats on the sub milestone :)
Lol I love your sarcasm
I bought like a cheap 99 cent store glow stick. And I made a slit in it , while it was over the jar. And I shook the how stick in the jar so it made a spatter effect, and it totally worked!(:
He's fine guys ... We all know it was just a little JOKE .
Rob, when you were celebrating about having 500,000 subs, I was like "why the fuck would you be celebrating if your fucking dying"
U can't eat that cupcake
I'm 100% sure glow sticks are fucking toxic lol you're gonna die. Don't die! 😢
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/4081455887668312/
I just discovered you guys recently, but I'm thoroughly enjoying your channel! Man vs. Pin is especially entertaining, especially when I discover brand new ideas I hadn't seen before, such as the glow in the dark rice. I've got no idea what I'd do with the stuff, but it looks awesome and now I want some too!
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/4081455887684498/
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/464504149041559842/ ThreadBanger You should try this one. It looks awesome. I check my email everyday to see when you have a new vid. AMAZING!!
Laughs at the people who thinks he actually ate the cupcake.
Well, glowstick juice is toxic. I really hope you didnt eat that cupcake
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/4081455887684502/
LOL!
Rob you can't eat a glow stick
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/548313323357274578/ Wish this worked, have a feeling it doesn't though lol But cool nonetheless
Please invite me to your funeral
I got really scared when you ate that! Those things have so many toxins in them and a lot of them have glass tubes that separate the chemicals 😷⚠️🚑
Oh Rob for the glow in the dark jar, you just make a small hole in a small glow stick and sort of hit it against the sides and shake it and then you get that awesome affect. Like a fairy house!
I always love how these turn out😂 thanks for making amazing funny videos!
For the glass jar the actual instructions are Ina YouTube video
the frosting would have worked because Tonic Water has quinine and glows in blacklight
I tried making the glow jars and when I cut the glow stick it got in my eye and hurt reeeeaaaaly bad! And of course it didn't even work :| great video tho! Love these
Look at this really cool pin! It jelly in an orange! http://pinterest.com/pin/452541462530953612/
I swear every time I click on one of your videos I can't love this show anymore. And  the first Second in, and you prove me wrong! You are the BEST!
P.s. the neon rice was off the chain
Can you try http://www.pinterest.com/pin/518125132102695807/
Awww. Wish u actually did the cupcake one. I was curious if that worked :( I shall cry now
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/353673376960705352/ This looks cool to try!
THE GLOWSTICK IS SO TOXIC OH MY PLZ DONT DIE
Lol @ the warning in the beginning, it's so sad that you have to add that for those select people XD
What's the point of swearing when you beep it out?  We all know what you're saying ._.
rainbow effect fan blades
http://pinterest.com/pin/A0v3OQAQQIcFOjjl1MgAAAA/
rip Rob
For the glowing frosting you can just use shortening, powdered sugar, tonic water, and food color if you want but I have know idea of the amounts
floam
Oh man I love this channel hahaha
You make those jars with glow in the dark puffy paint, not glow sticks silly
If we all don't see you in the next vid, we all will know what happened.
Is the rice and the cupcake edible? I want to try it
Omg I love you, you make my day
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/533676624567777004/ This would be cool to try!!
Awesome video love this series !!!! And how they did the fairy jar the first time was cut open a glow stick and shake it around the inside of the jar to get a splatter effect!
Why make glow in the dark frosting on a cupcake if you can't eat it XD
does it only glow under black light?
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/533676624567777004/  This !!! This would be a cool pin to try !!!
I think it's really nice that he responses to comments
Please don't die ...
I almost shit myself when you ate the cupcake I just sat there shaking my head XD then I was like ohhhhh
I have glow sticks.... I'm making it happen tonight!!
You should try diy chalkboard paint! I don't have a link thoooo 😊
Okay, yeah, cause don't eat that stuff. I got, like, a drop in my mouth once and I was sure I was about to die.
At first I was like: "Don't eat the glow juice!!!!" And then I was like: "Oh yeah, this is Man vs Pin, it's all good"
Yall are like awesome! Defiantly liking this video!
Lol you're neon jacket is da bomb 👌
I love the new disclaimer ;) haha
Glow a thong
You at from the glow stick 😳
325 coment bit unly 301 vuiws :D hecks!!
Ahh man, I love you guys! Hilarious video yet again, it's always great to see a YouTuber who isn't afraid of some fuckery. Seriously, keep up the magical work, throwing rainbows and sunshine your way
you are officially my fave channel on youtube
Isn't the stuff inside glowsticks toxic????
I really wanted to see if the tonic water worked
Glow stick juice is poisons don't eat it
I did the fairy jar before :)
I thought it said "GLOW-A-THONG" :/
Tonic water does actually glow under a black light! I mean I totally agree, too much work to make the frosting but it is doable!
http://www.ilovetocreate.com/ProjectDetails.aspx?name=Delicate+Dimensions+Doily
Hahaha I pissed myself at the end lol
for the fairy jars instead of using the paint you can get the thin glow sticks and hit it on the sides of the jars and it works just as well as the paint
Is the rice under a black light or is it just  dark? Just wondering
Hey Robbb!!! Please make more man vs pin!!!!!      Who agrees he should??
Hey guys (and gals) I'm a new Canadian YouTuber :) it would mean the world to me if you subscribed to my channel as I put a HUGE amount of effort into making my videos to make YOU smile :D THUMBS UP if it wasn't a waste of your time! :D
You adding the frosting to the glowstick fluid made me very oh so very sad. Terrible to waste frosting.
I wonder if I can eat glow in the dark rice...?
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/391602130072782355/ cool result... not much explanation
Isn't glow stick juice poisonous
Isn't glow stick juice
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/346636502542566461/ i think this would be really cool !!!
Rob you confuse me
i hope you didnt eat the glowstick liquid one

.... You should never eat glow in the dark liquid, it is poisonous
Glow in the dark fairy jar is made when you take glow in the dark paint and paint dots of it inside the jar. (This is another method)

The glow in the dark frosting one would work with any type of icing so long you used tonic water that had quinine in it as this glows under a blacklight :)
omg i died at 1:47, such a good video rob!
Hi I'm Da ChIcKeN  ThreadBanger
ThreadBanger
ThreadBanger can you try again on the mason jar glow thing? What your "suppose" to do is get skinny long glow sticks. Cut the end of it and place in the mason jar. Shake the glow stick to make it
Omg I had a mini heart attack when he took a bite of that cupcake

I love threadbanger so awesome DONT STOP DIYING
I  love how half of the things on Pinterest doesn't work
I THOUGHT YOU ACTUALLY ATE THE GLOW STICK CUPCAKE! I was about to cry )): lol but the neon rice looks really cool!!
Troll
Plz tell me the glow stick was non-toxic? I mean glow sticks taste like shit (I was a kid and my hands were glowing, of course I licked it) so I don't think you ate the wrong one but just in case....
First v omment
You did the jar thing wrong, you have to add like A SHIT TON of glitter. Worked fine for me.
Ismt the glow stick juice a bunch of chemicals and shit and u but it in frosting then on a cupcake and ate it?!?!? Like wtf ew no!
Sinon says hai to thread banger!
Pretty sure glowsticks are pretty bad for you
Please try this "egg painting" thing http://www.growingajeweledrose.com/2013/10/paint-filled-eggs-on-canvas.html?m=1
Glow stick juice is toxic
The first pin works. You are not suppose to cut it up and pour everything straight into the jar. You are suppose to cut the tip of the glow stick and shake it into the jar. I did it plenty of times before. It works!
These videos are so amazing. : D !!!
MyCupcakeAddiction actually shows you how to make glow in the dark frosting. Just saying it if you want to see if it really works.
For the fairy jar thing you're supposed to put dryer sheets in the jar, then put in the glow stick liquid stuff and shake it.
😱😖💀
Also try this fit candle  http://www.usefuldiy.com/diy-multi-color-candle/
That glow in the dark jar thing is soooo stupid
I loooove your videos!!!!!! Haha the ending was the best tho 👌
Hey threadbanger, don't know if its rob or corrinne, but I love you guys' videos :) good luck with yalls channel
Please try this http://lilluna.com/diy-lava-lamps/
Cool jacket bro
U nees 2 put water in the jarrrrrrrrrrrrr
I'm so making the glow in the dark rice!!
AWESOME!!
I actually did the Glow in the dark Fairy jars with the paint and it works! I made mine two years ago and it still glows!
I wouldn't even cut a glowstick open.. those are so toxic and not even worth it. Any pin with glowstick juicing in it I dismiss as bullshit
I've seen the glow in the dark fairy jars on YouTube before, it's real pretty on video but up close its like polka dots on paper (which is exactly what it is)
the end lmao 😂
XD I love watching you guys
can you make a candy bowl?!?!
HI THREADBANGERS pls say hi back or nah
HEY I LOVE YOU ROB
OH MY GOSH HE ATE IT. I know he didn't eat it 😮 😄
Well, if I don't see another vid again I'll know what happened. It was nice know ya bud! ThreadBanger
Haha! "I can understand why this girl loves it" classic! Funny x

You should do that pin involving melting a record into a bowl shape! Or cutting a record into butterlfies! Please!
I hope u ate the right one @threadbanger
He ate glow sticks😭
Ok so the glowstick cupcake thing. Thats a no no right? We shouldnt eat that?
