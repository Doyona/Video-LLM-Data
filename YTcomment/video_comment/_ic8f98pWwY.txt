GREAT  PRETZELS ! LOOKS SO  SOFT AND  TASTY ! 😊😊❤❤. JANICE HERBERT
Thank You so much for sharing your recipes with everyone around the world.  Oh my the pretzels are so delicious.. I have already ate 3 today, & just made them too.  How do you roll them up? I have a problem doing that. Everything else I do well. Please help me when you have time. Thank You in advance
Just tried these but dough was to sticky.... hmmmm  Can you post an actual ingredients with quantities  of each.  Yours looked much better than mine
Cool
Nice video
Good
Good recipe
Woooo yamiiii
Very nice 👍
🍩👌😜🍩👌😜🍩👌😜🍩👌😜🍩👌😜🍩👌😜
OMG! Your son is sooo cute! I came here for the pretzels but I almost forgot about them😄
mustard is good on them
I was skeptical about the 2 whole teaspoons of salt you're to add to the dough, but I trusted it wasn't a typo or something and I'm glad I did! After making it I taste that it was the right amount of salt, it makes them so savory. BUT THEY ARE TOOO DELICIOUS. This is my new pretzel recipe. Thanks for sharing, Hilah! I also really enjoyed your piece with Easy Tiger... It's on the other side of the country from me but it seems like the place to drink a beer and eat a giant pretzel.
"a boner in the morn..."   that was priceless!  thank you.
Omg hilah! chef baby is so big! the last time I remember him he was sitting in his high chair with short hair getting his first teeth in and now he's talking! wow he's so cute! ! love his hair
Awesome..Yeah!!!
These pretzels are making me thirsty.
Mmmm soft pretzels with dipping chocolate... Btw love your top, Hilah!
I don't know which one I like better, the pretzels or your shirt!!
Hi Hilah me and my mom get inspired bye your stuff and your such a great cook bye😊👍👍
"..like a boner in the morn"?! OMG I almost choked on my lemonade!! Hilah you make me giggle like a little girl! You're truly a gas.
😂😂 I love it, risin like a boner in the morn 😂😂
omg you are my favorite I love pretzels this is the best recipe I've seen yet
For real fans,  Video Bests:  * Best physics/chemistry moment in a Hilah video: 2:42  full on PBS.  * Best history of stuff moment. "Prairie Soap." (listen carefully for that.) *Best existential / time travel moment in a Hilah video 8:24 - 7 little words... explains the universe. *Best throwback... the Easy Tiger episode of "Hilah's Texas Kitchen" was outstanding... a Beer fest. * Best new word created by Chef Baby: Beck'uhl?  Ahhhggggh! :-)
Man that background beat was funky! You must have had chef baby on the turntables
And here I thought they were hard to make! This is even easier than making pizza dough, and if my yeast isn't out of date and dead, I'ma gunna make a batch of these tomorrow!  I stopped buying all purpose flour a few years ago. I just use bread flour for everything. Well... nobody told me I couldn't...  LOL
Love ya hilah, great recipe, great vid, but i dont like the music :/ chef baby is super cute
Oh goodness!!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 they look sooo delicious 😝
OMG Flint is growing SO FAST!!! He's absolutely beautiful!!
When you think it can't happen, Chef Baby gets cuter every show!
Love the hand actions on what soft pretzels are like Hilah 😂
I'm European and I cook with measuring cups imported from relatives living in NA! It's just so much more convenient than having to bust a scale out for every little thing.
PB and pretzels yum!
I'm in a place without Auntie Anne's :(..... You probably just saved my life!
"Boner in the morn" oh Hilah, you're too much 😂
Is it alright to use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour? It's either not sold or super expensive where I live.
Those look great!  I love warm soft pretzels, and I could tell from your reaction that the pimento cheese went super with them!
"It has risen like a boner in the  morn."  LMAO
Where are the disgusting, perverted comments?  People these days. 😆
Yeast are the sea horses of the culinary world
Hey Gorgeous Hila, where did you get the clear bowl?  Thx, Ned Dallas, TX
Beeeeeeeeeeeer cheeeeeeeeeese!!!
This chick is the shitz!! GEAUX GIRL!! Great Vid
Always a thumbs up for you Hilah!!! Your polka music just had me laughing and laughing. Thank you
Weed .That baby is mother fucking adorable!!
The soft synth in the background is that extra special touch.
I've tried making soft pretzels so many times with very little success. I'm gonna try this recipe tomorrow and see how it goes. You've yet to steer me wrong on a recipe. I also love that these are egg-free with no alterations as my niece (who I'll be making this with)  is highly allergic.
I love the recipe but I have to say your baby is so beautiful!
You have probably been asked this a million times.. but. .. what does your tattoo mean?   Also.. I am so gonna try this one day!
Pimento cheese goes with everything.  Chef Baby is one freakin cute baby.
Looks so good thx doll
My poor diet lol
I use margarita salt on my pretzels because it's always nice to have that on hand
Those look great! I remember making pretzels in middle school home ec but I don't think we did a bath. Maybe egg wash? Also WOW Chef Baby is now Chef Toddler and super cute.
is that a new kitcheb
omg you are solo funny! they go together like this????? lmao
I'm weirdly amazed to find out that pretzels were dipped in lye. I just though they were boiled then baked.
Your husband is a lucky, lucky man.  Remind him of that.  Oh, and if I guessed wrong and you don't have one, I can be rented out for parties.
They look lecker 😉
I love you hilah! 😄♡
good Lord! chef baby grew so big. and all that blonde hair. wow!
Absolutely love these pretzels Hilah, they look fabulous.
I love this recipe and your bananas are obviously very awesome.
hilah what you gonna be for Halloween this year? tinker bell again 8)
Wow... I used to love getting these in the mall... Haven't seen em around in years.
These look great!  But, as a soapmaker who works with lye every day, I have to add a disclaimer to this video!  First of all, I've done no research on lye as it relates to pretzelmaking, but I have to say that extreme caution should always be used when working with lye and protective equipment, including gloves, should ALWAYS be used when working with lye.  If you had dipped your bare hands into lye water, you would have bought yourself a trip to the emergency room with extreme burns.  I don't know what baking the baking soda does in terms of exact pH changes, but I'd advise anyone to use caution when working with possibly caustic chemicals.  That's all!  As an ICU nurse and soap maker, I couldn't NOT say anything!  Now, on to the pretzelmaking I go!
Hilah, these look amazing! I can't wait to try making these!
By heating bicarbonate of soda you eventually convert it to sodium carbonate -- or washing soda.  It crisps your pretzels and boosts your laundry detergent, too!
I'm hungry yo 😢
I love hot warm soft pretzels.  Great recipe.  Couldn't help but laugh at your comment at 4:50.  Thanks Hilah.
The music en This video!! LOL
These look fantastic Hilah!  You make cooking so much fun!  Chef Baby is so big now....and all that wavy blonde hair! What a cutie!!   :)
great show as usual.
BTW I love the tip on raising the ph level of the baking soda
Hey Hilah <3
Just a little bit of Sun Hilah?  Oh and the pretzels look delicious.
I like them with honey mustard.
Chef baby is getting so big!!
What do you like to eat your soft pretzels with?
I've never been this early! hello Hilah :)
lol the ending! <3
I just got done baking, I made some mini baguettes. I made soft pretzels a month ago as well. They were so good, I was surprised because it was my first time making them.
They look so good I will try to make some thanks for posting this.Video
Hi, Hilah. Those pretzels look delicious, perfect for snacking. I am definitely going to try it. What do you love about having a huge fan base? Have a good weekend, Hilah.
Yum! I will try them and send you a picture of the results!
