Best sewing tip I learned in high school,  take a piece of tape of marker and make a line from the edge of your foot all the way outward to the front of your sewing machine. That way you have a guide for the fabric for easier straight lines.
I love the the material !
This video could have been a lot better if you stop wiggling and make it more serious.  It was not clear and therefore confusing.
Well explained through a very short video! Love it!
Your stich  not  under stand  please  clear  explain
Super 👌👌
if you use a zig zag stich it isnt as obvious if its not straight
👍👍
I love this bag!! I love the fabric too.....don't sell yourself short, this bag looks great! I'm a Gramma and I'm new to sewing. We learn as we go. Good job explaining things to us, and you look like you could be a model. God bless you sweetie. Hoping to see more tutorials.
Thanks for useful tutorials
Good job! Great video. 👏👏👏
Great tutorial! I was able to follow all of it other than the part where you fold the bottom corners into triangles and cut.. But I was able to make a flat tote bag anyway which is perfect for a gift for my sister in law! 😊
Just finish my bag is it a big one!!  I like it! I did add a pocket on the outside and did some quilting on the outside material. I put interfacing on inside of the front and inside lining. Good instructions!! I wish I could put a picture of it.
Hi, at 5 minutes on your clip it is not clear when you sew it up.
Hi!! thank you so much for this video!! it really helped!!!
Thank you!
Just made this out of old jeans, looks fabulous! Thank you! 🤗
Pl Hindi me bataye nice bag
Well done
How can be so much talent and so much beauty in one person?❤️
You are marvelous! So are my bags!! Thank you!

Hey dope bag! I also do made a bag like this! but it had to be a tote and backpack at the same time. I filmed it and its in my channel .🔥⬅️️🏃
Thanks
Beautiful! Well done! Love your cute tote bag! 💖💞😍
Super👜❣️❣️❣️
The simplest tutorial I've seen this far...easy to follow and I plan to hand sew mine
Can you write it down the size of the fabric ？ Thank you！
I absolutely love this video. I've made one bag already. Working on bags 2 and 3.
im def. gonna try this i make purses and bags already so im gonna have to try to make a tote so excited cant wait to start
Good work, keep it up
So so so cute, I am definitely going to try it. Love the bag and your accent is wicked cute  😊😆
Very, clear detailed instructions
Thank you for this tutorial,  I am now one bag richer! Made a really  nice one, I added a pocket inside and did topstiches :) can't wait to use it!
is there a way to add a zipper?
Wow 💓 💓💓💓
Thank you for sharing. 👋🏽
Super madam i am from india
Omg u made it look so easy. Cant wait
Wow so beautiful
Super easy to follow, saving for when I get my sewing machine set up but this is a great video! Thank you so much for sharing!
This really helped me visualise how I want to construct my own bag! Thanks from another Dutchy!
Hi I made my first one ... Thanks to you
ongratulations on your work and advice, continue ! Here is one of my creations to offer: https://www.redbubble.com/fr/people/42nikky/works/43784731-fleurs-de-paon?asc=u&p=tote-bag&rel=carousel
For tutorials and DIYs show the materials and the steps are better than too much talking. Thanks.
We need only cloth
You know what ? Not everybody has a sewing machine
Super easy - I made the cutest Paw Patrol toy tote for my grandson!  Thank you so much!
Making this for a second time. I love it. Thank you! :)
Thank you so much ! I just finished it and it is magnificent ! It's a bit harder that expected, it is necessary to be really thorough if you want to align properly all the seams on the side (no discontinuity).  I've adapted the measurements so that it now is my new lunch bag for work :) Also, I left the opening between the two "linkages" of one handle. That way, I simply made a seam all around the opening, and it's the only seam visible on the bag overall (I took extra care not to mess this one !). Thank you again, I can't wait to see the face of my co-workers tomorrow !
Good job sister
U r preety more than this bag
I love your eyes
Very difficult to follow your instructions. Hard to get which is top and down when you are sitting horizontal in the camera. Would have been better if you pointed the sides using your hand
realy nice
Super cute bag! Don't you use metric in the Netherlands? I thought everywhere in Europe did.
you are so pretty
I know that this is an older video, as it’s now 2019, but this is very helpful.  I’m a beginner and I really appreciate the easy to understand directions. It was very clear especially the part where one attaches the handles.  Thank you!
It is very cute I love the bags very much👜👜👜
Thank you so so much for this video
You are quite amazing.... subscribed.
I like your video
Hame kujh samajh Nahi aaya
Sorry, a tad confusing as I am a beginner! When sewing the straps and adding the lining, how did you actually do it?
Beginner my butt! This is absolutely amazinggg
Pls learn other crafts and then teach it to us  awesome
I've made this and it's a nice size bag. The one thing I did was use fusible fleece for more stability
You are adorable. I actually downloaded the step by step directions and there was definitely a lot left out of this video. My tote bag came out beautifully!
Good
Made 2 bags from watching,  easy to follow...thanks for up loading 😁
Beautiful
Couldn’t watch it through, sorry. It’s not really an easy tutorial when you don’t show what you’re doing. An explanation of what you’re doing and a brief glimpse of it is just not sufficiently clear. “Pin and down and sew it up” doesn’t really say much. I moved on to a real tutorial
Very helpful. Thank you
Just awesome 😍😍😍
hello very nice bag very nice video I would like to watch a full video tutorial all about the sewing machine you used to sew this please kindly film ok?please kindly reply back ok?thank you very much
Awesome, I am going to make this bag. Great job!
Great video!! You explained the steps very well!!
This is rinky sharma
Thanks Di, am from india
Thank you a lot! I try this and everything is great!
took me hours to understand which side was up and what side i was sewing ... was hard to tell from the video ... explanation was bad for beginners ... ended up with a failure
This could of been alot better, your not saying which is the bottom or the top when you first sew the rectangle on the front fabric. Also you could of showed more of how your making this bag.
Great video! Thank you so much! You make it look so simple! I’m going to try it out!!!
Very cute bag, well done. Ironing/pressing all seams also makes it look more professional. We should never skip this step.
Gotta be a better way to NOT use so much fabric.  Very confusing
How many yards of each fabric! I’m a beginner and definitely want to try this 😊
Good idea
구엽다!😻😽
I have that sewing in a straight line problem too. I bought a walking presser foot on EBay for less than $10.00 and poof! Problem solved?
very beautiful
Super
Nice Paris
You are showing your face more than the bag .
Please make more sewing tutorials,  this was so fun and easy.  And you're great at explaining things.  😊
Oh No!! Ours came out inside out!!  Thought we followed the steps well.  Drat!
Hi iam new at sewing and really want to make an day bag but I don't want the red line in the bottom can I just skin that
Tried to follow the instructions but I was too distracted by this beautiful, cute woman talking at me.
Soooooper
I love this video, I am a total beginner to sewing and would love to make handbags, this was so helpful and patiently explained so thank you. Subscribed for sure :)
Did you use a graph board and cutting tools or just a ruler and scissors? I can’t wait to try this but it will be my first project, I just got a sewing machine for my birthday✨ Thanks for the tutorial! I really like the way your bag has more of a hippie feel then the topstitched bag ❤️✨
cute
very nice
Thank you  for the  tutorial,  I  can't wait to make one for myself

Hi I was wondering if you would make a tutorial on how to make the Gracie Tote Bag by Joan Hawley of Lazy Girl          Designs. I am not good at sewing and for me she didn’t explain some things so I thought id ask you .What do you say.

Show more sewing
Great tutorial. It's important to note for novice sewers like myself that when using lighter fabrics, use an interfacing to make it sturdy, when stitching the top/handles to stitch around so the top is still open. And when putting the outer bag into the lining, make sure to flip it the right way before inserting it. Thanks so much I'm really happy with how mine turned out!
thx I love ur way thxx .plz show hand bags
alles goede.
such a helpful video.....thank you for sharing
nice and beautiful
I literally watched this 45 times
how many yards did you use for this project?
THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!!!  IT IS VERY HELPFUL!!!!!
Easy as can be bag!!!  Would add batting for structure and pockets! I also would sew a box and X on each strap for strength!  Easy Easy Easy !!!
Would i need a fancy sowing machine for the stitching or will like a $90 one do ok? Thank you
How many yards did you buy
Useful tip for anyone who sews: Sharpen your scissors by merely taking some tin foil/aluminum foil and any scissors - pinking shears for fabric, crafting scissors, kitchen shears, everyday scissors, or even children's safety scissors - that need sharpening and snip-snip-snip the tin/aluminum foil until you're satisfied with the sharpness of the scissors/shears/crafting scissors. This is something that I have tried myself with every one of the dozen - or two dozen - pairs of scissors that I own, and it definitely works.
Very nice!
Are you Dutch?
beautiful
what measurements did you use?
Thank you so much for making this tutorial. I have tried so many other tutorials and they are all so confusing. This tutorial is amazing and clear. Your bag looks amazing. You should maybe consider making more sewing videos since this one was so good

I don't have a sewing machine and I really wanna try this diy, but I'm afraid a simple needle and thread wouldn't hold strong enough, I actually want to make a bag for school
very nice
Well I have to say that you did a fantastic job. Are you sure that you are a beginner. I am having some difficulty understanding. I guess I need to rewind this video until i get it. I see that the majority of people understood you but I am truly a beginner and would love to make this bag. Thanks again for sharing. Irene

Can you please tell me how to determine how far from the seams to place the handles, I see different distances on different tutorials. Is there a formula or standard?

رائع أنت مبدعة
this is a great video, I made my bag out of old sheets and scrap fabric since I was practicing and didn't wanna waste fabric, but it came out gorgeous, thanx for sharing
Thank you, you inspired me, i like it... verry like it...  thank you  #i'm from indonesian
Hello how are you? I am from India and why don't you show double zip hand bag?
The bag turned out great. I'm can really. Good job. Keep at it.
It's from "Bijou Lovely" blog-called the Market Tote Bag. The detailed photos and step by step instructions are still there. I am supposing this is where you got the design from?
Can you reveal the source of this pattern? I made this bag a few years ago and it was a detailed step by step written pattern from someone's blog. I was looking for it and found this tutorial. The original was a blue and white bag. Thank you.
Thank you, you inspired me to start sewing and creating again!
♥LOVE THIS BAG!♥
Love it, please email me a video so I can learn more.
You make this look so easy! lol
What type of fabric did you use? I'm thinking of making this bag and I don't know what kind of fabric to get at the store. Thanks.
And it's too close which is kinda difficult to understand
You're showing your face more than the work
Can u edit the description so the measurements are in the description box
My 12 year friend sent me this link for the tote bag and I love it!  Easy to follow and quick to sew with fabulous results - even for a beginner!  Thanks!
what the name of the fabric?
the bag is so awesome
I'm your new subscriber  thanks a lot

for coffee lover :) https://www.etsy.com/listing/267430988/coffee-addict-bag-cotton-canvas-tote-bag?ref=shop_home_active_1
I had made many such bags.Thanks for showing.
you sound like a boy
I gotta say when I first saw this video I was confused lol the putting the outer fabric inside the inner was like mind blowing for me. The first bag I made I accidentally sewed the handles with them outside, not inside and I came out with no handles LOL but handles were in between the fabrics. The second time I made it, it came out perfect! I LOVE THIS TUTORIAL
I loved ur video thank you so much I did my first tote thanks to you :)
I love this. Thank you!!!
your email address is being held in the UK, and I will be in the UK, and I will be in the
Your eyes are so pretty!!
Followed this video all the way to the end, and when I turned my bag inside out, my handles are inside of the lining. I don't understand how that happened, everything turned out fine except for that. Really sad because I've been working on it since yesterday.
nice
heyy:) can i sew this by hand...?
Man, this is for beginners? I would except something like, sew a square way here and here and you have a bag... >.>
I never saw you sew the bottom of the lining fabric to the bottom of the outside fabric. Are the two bottoms of the bag attached or is the lining just attached at the top?
I love your accent! Thank you for this video, it is very helpful! I'm a beginner as well
that was amazing 😘good job 1
that was amazing 😘good job
This is awesome.
supper
her voice is so wierd !!
Omg, thank you so much for this tutorial! I made a bag and it turned out great! I am so glad I watched your video!
What type of machines are you using dear? I noticed two?
I love your bag.! you make it so easy so Im going to town in the next couple of mins to buy my fabric and have a go.
Hi Loepsie, Thanks for this video. At the begin of the video, you mentioned that you learned this tutorial from a website. I didn't get the name of the website. Can you please tell me the name? Thanks!
This is amazing for a beginner!You have got true talent!the first this that I ever made one a sewing machine was a bag......but it wasn't very good though...
muy lindo y sencillo de  hacer
Amazing I just love it
I'm so excited I just finished up my bag after watching this video and I love it! for sure a good "beginner" tote bag! thanks!! :)
خير الكلام ماقل ودل انتى تكلمتى اكثر مما خيطتى وانا لم افهم شى من الجنطة
Cute bag ! You talk too much ! I need a new tote .thanks for sharing! So l"ll be sewing one for my self. *
Thank you Loepsie for an awesome tutorial!You are so simpatic.Greetings from Slovenia!
Can you please do a tutorial on how to do the basic hand stitches? And also please leave a link if you comment. Thanks!
Love you girl, you are so funny and upbeat.love your bag,it's fun and simple to make.i so glad for this tutorial,because I hate complicated things.
I don't understand why you sewed the base piece 8 inches from bottom and then folded it down. You're already lining the bag so why double up so much of the fabric? Not complaining but I don't understand because it seems like a waste of fabric. You are fun to watch!
i love it so cute
You are adorable! What your video was lacking in actual instruction was more than made up for with your sweet voice and happy disposition! Thank you!
Does anyone else notice her voice? Its like a roller coaster of girly to deep. Lol
SUBTITLES IN SPANISH PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE !!!!
Amazing! I'm totally going to try to do this!
I instantly subscribe because I think you're a really kind person and you love what you do too.. And your instructions are easily to understand for dummies like me.. hahahaha XD  Thank you for this tutorial!
Thank you for this awesome tutorial.   I love how your bag turned out.
You kind of look like Stana Katic.
I'm confused...
Sorry if my english is bad. I don't understand the measure, anybody can me right it please? Sorry again for my english and Thanks.
You did a great job!! It's so cute and I think your cutting and sewing skills are fantastic!! I've sewn for a long time but I still want to make this bag after watching you make it!!
I would love to share this with my group. would you be ok if we watched your video together as a group.?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHRUpw-E6d8
love your accent
congrats on so many views for this video Loepsie!

Hi, this was so helpful! I made one for my Mum for Mother's Day! *****
Awesome video! Thanks.
You are so fantastic! I just made two of these and they are so adorable. I know what everyone is getting for Christmas this year lol. Thank you!
thats so cute i really liked yr fabric
Thanks for the video! You are seeew cute. Thanks
I think you did a great job. I would do the top stitch around the top. Just go slow. Remember, practice makes perfect. If you have a 1/4 inch foot that would help you alot. But great job.  hugs Barb
Great job,thanks
I love your bag!! I'm a beginner at sewing and you made this seem so easy!  Where did you get your fabric?
I love your acsent
What accent r u
very cute
You might want to mention how far the allowance is for sewing. Are you sewing an inch in or a half an inch... etc. because you want to keep it consistent all the way around.
Great tutorial. Thank you!
Your hair looks so cute in this video!
Thank you so much for doing this!  Please keep doing sewing tutorials.  I am a total beginner.  You explain things well.  And, personally, I appreciate your simplification of the process!  Have a wonderful day!
Again - you look so adorable in curls ;) And what I personally find the best in your channel is your attitude. Love from Poland! :)
I love how DIY is seen as an art these days. I remember when I was in junior high I made a tote bag in sewing class and got made fun of. Lovely bag I am definitely going to try this!!!
I didn't realize it was mushroomed pattern until she said it, I thought it was strawberries and marshmallows. I feel soo smart :D LOLS
I remember you made your own laptop sleeve before, right? Would love a tutorial for that! (I need one, haha)
Love this! This would be a great gift for people
You've done a great job, well done!
I love your Spice Girls ruler! 😊
That's so cute! I think I'm going to make that for my best friend :)
I love your hair!! How did you do the braids? Is it just two French braids?
I love the fabrics you chose. So cute! :)
Cute bag! But you skipped the interfacing!  I know it seems like a fussy step, but if you buy iron-on it's really simple.  Without it, the bag may not hold its shape over time and may start to warp and twist.  I'm a pedantic sewer, haha...
Best sewing tip I learned in high school,  take a piece of tape of marker and make a line from the edge of your foot all the way outward to the front of your sewing machine. That way you have a guide for the fabric for easier straight lines.
Cute tote bag. I really like the toadstool fabric, and the combo with the red. It looks simple but sweet :). Thank you for the easy and clear instructions / tutorial Lucy ^.^
That looks great, I've been sewing for about 4 years and I've been watching your videos for about 6 years and I'm proud to see you try your hand on new things. Looking forward to more videos on seeing from you.
Well done for a beginner ! My first projet was a little 'bag' for my tablet with passepoil ( don't know the name in english). Thanks for the tutorial I keep it somewhere for when I found a great fabric to do it ! Oh and a little advice from beginner to beginner it really helps to iron your fabric at the beginning and before adding new pieces of fabrics 😊
I think it would help if the camera was further away to show the entire bag :)
Such an awesome tote bag! Also, side note, I literally could not stop admiring your stunning hairstyle in this video. Absolutely gorgeous on you, I wish to replicate it XD loving your videos and vlogs!
Now I wish I had a sewing machine! Looks like such a fun project :)
