I love the shorts! But you just used glue? Does it won't fall off when you washed it? It's kinda looks unsecure.
Will the lace fall off when i wash the shorts?
Cute shorts
Will the lace come off once you wash the denim shorts? I dont trust super glue or whatever so much
I love your shirt too! :)
Creative idea❇❇❇
Love the shorts! (: but the song was so annoying ! :/
Will the lace get screwed up in the wash?

Facial care companies would like people to give their products a try to demonstrate how good they are. Have you ever seen a skincare section set-up in your local mall offering free test products? Well I discovered a website that will send Free trials to your home, its the best way to get free skincare products :) You can get them here bit.ly/1cNG0a5?v=bssdo
I really love the shorts but oh my god that song was so annoying!
LOVE your anchor shirt
; those are nudie shorts ? cause if they are they cost like 150 .-.
You have a perfect body! Can you do a video about exercise or food you eat? :)
Wont the lace wash off when you wash the shorts
You are now like my favorite youtuber.
Please give this comment a chance. I know most of you will probably scroll right by this.. But if anybody, even if it is one person just can give me a chance i will not disappoint. Some of my new viewers assume I'm a famous youtuber because of the quality of my videos.. I'm not saying that to sound full of myself, i swear I'm not. It's just the beauty community is so competitive I'm trying to find a way to stand out. Even if I'm spamming a video I'm trying. Anybody who reads take a chance please
how did you get the voice over like with the music and your voice? is there like a software for that?
try a craft store like Michael's
you could buy it from any craft store like Michael's :)
Sorry 1:46
Actual video sarts at 1
Paramore shirt! :o :)
Where did u get your shirt?????
I sewed my lace on and it worked pretty well. It just takes a while longer.
no!!!!
OM TO THE G WHERE DID YOU GET THAT ANCHOR TOP!!!! SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!
where did you buy the lace?
Not if it's waterproof glue
Please make a tutorial on how to cut jeans into shorts
I spy a paramore t-shirt :D
Yes!
do these go through the washer and dryer well, anyone? thank you!
Is anyone else getting annoyed by the song she's playing
Does the glue come off in the washing machine? :o
Most of the time that what has to be done. Since its sorta hard to find high waisted shorts that are plain more people just go to a thrift store (or their moms closet, lol) but even then a lot of time you just find pants, but its cheaper and they're really easy to cut, youtube some diys on cutting into high waisted shorts if you need help!
Where did you get the lace from??
great!
Do the shorts get uncomfortable with all that glue?
PacSun! :)
Cute
Cutest shorts I've seen! I have to make those!! How much do they cost in store?!
Those are fab!
these are cool, where did you get the lace? c:
I like these a lot
Love the jeans , whats this song called?
