Im thinking about taking the driving test using my brother car but he took off the muffler which makes it kinda loud but not too loud will i be able to use that car?
I am 17 and I turn 18 on April. I have been practicing driving for a while now with my learners permit and I do feel ready to take y drivers license. But where I live there are people who cross on the streets and Jaywalk frequently and it gets hard to drive around them. This video helped me think more of that situation and I would rather stop from a distance

Taking mine in 20 minutes 🤣 I’m not nervous though I’ve driven for years with no license 💀
My test is tomorrow at 10 AM I’m so scared! I’ll update!  Update: Passed w one mistake. So easy... if you’re losing sleep or fearing that you’re going to choke, just let me tell you all that stress goes away when you start driving and it feels super normal. It’s like 10 minutes so easy

Wish me luck😬
Is it just me or does this guy sound like Eddie Murphy
Too much background noise including the music..
One more critical error NO ONE will ever teach you(at least this is true in california) if you dont check your blind spot before making ANY turn you will fail, even if it is a right hand turn and there is no bike lane or parking between you and the side walk. I fail my test this morning because of that
Anyone here from Williamsburg Va who has taken the test already
Wish me luck
Taking mine tomorrow 😭I’m nervous!
I just passed my learner's test and so scared now with regards to driving lessons
I knew I had failed on my first try when I put it on reverse to leave the parking lot & hadn’t even turned the car on... lmao
I was so close to passing my second test, but I got to confident with making a left turn on an intersection. The instructor had to intervene. It was the second to last turn into the DMV.

Taking my test in less than 3 hours... Third attempt. Thank you very much for this!!

5:00 Lmaoo "Dont be that guy, dont be that guy."
I will take the First test in 2019 Next Month, hopefully I will pass, I try to not nervous when the test start. Because I notice that when you are nervous, your brain will think too much things, it can cause you focus bad on the driving.  Try to not nervous, just relax and drive the ways that Examiner tell you to do！
Bro cut the music off
lmfao nigga redo this vid your lazy lol
Watching this the night before my test wish me luck :)
Just took it and I passed with flying colors! I can’t believe I was nervous. Practice and be confident.   Tips how to pass: -ALWAYS use turn signals no matter where you turn or how small.  -They’ll make you reverse straight. Make sure to turn your body to look back! (I missed points for not doing this.)  -Watch the speed limit.  -Do Hand-over-Hand U-turns.  -Stop before the white line at stop signs and make a COMPLETE stop.
Im taking my drivers test in Inglewood tomorrow. Im hella scared, thank you for making the video!

Very good instruction in giving tip on driving license lessons👍
I feel like I've seen you somewhere. Dont know if it was another video.
Man the only errors he's making is his typing
Okay the video quality you made this video with is very bad when you're making an instructional video don't have music playing in the background where we can't hear you I had to turn this video off as soon as you started your car and was blaring your radio and didn't even turn it off I guess that shows how to pass your driving test just start your car and play radio
what city is that? and thank you! this was helpful. I take my tests after Im done going through the Drivers Handbook
taking mine TOMORROW ON MY BIRTHDAY LORD FORGIVE ME FOR MY SINS AND LET ME PASSSSSS

If I'm driving a vehicle with a rear camera how important is it to still check the rear window when backing up?
I have my test in a little over a month. I’m nervous
I was thrown on the interstate highway as soon as I got my permit. I did just fine.
Whose mans is this? Showing ppl how to drive high asf
5:42  true a guy almost hit me because he want turn right
Jesus loves you no matter what you have done. He died and ros eform death so we could be forgiven of the critical mistakes we make.

Forgot about hand placement on the wheel
I failed my driving test twice from critical errors but passed it like 2 months ago... Behind the wheel is mainly just scanning and making the right turns, I was focusing more on having the perfect speed limit/handling when I failed
Bro it’s amazing I watch your wave videos and I just so happen to see this !

If I am driving behind a slow vehicle during my driving test, can I go around them or do I have to wait for the instructor to tell me to do it?

Your music is a critical error it self lmao.
This guy is dumb lol

Thank you I appreciate this bro!
You want use to fail I mean you got loud ass music on while teaching
You almost drowned me bro
Omgggg my test is tomorrow...can’t sleep
Have my test in 2 days, wish me luck!
Im so happy, I PASSED THE FIRST TIME!!!
I don't know why im nervous about this. I passed the written and practice with no problem.
i failed the first time, for running over curb. just be careful, and make sure you STAYXfar away from the curb!!!
The lady I was with didn't give me enough time to make turns she told me to turn left or right 10 feet before I needed to make the turn so everything I did looked sloppy and like I was driving for the first time also I my driving instructor let us use the backup camera in the car we had, but the car my parents own is a older vehicle so I had no back up camera and I hit the cone ls not to mention she was a bitch I hated her she was rude and when I was done with the test she just said you didn't pass and talked about everything I did good and not about what I failed and how to improve on it. now I have to wait a month to take it again because where I live has the stupidest rule where you can only take the test on the second Friday of the month
It’s crazy you driving in my area lol but I took my test and failed she said I blew a stop sign but there was no sign??? Sooo how i? But okay how you scan the road and not get distracted? Because I’ll be scanning and then I see something and I’ll be like “yo did you see that dog!!???” And I keep looking back to see whatever the distraction was 😂
How many mistakes I'm aloud
I failed my first try😭
Pls turn off music
I don’t understand if u know ur making a video why do u have the music so high

Taking my test tomorrow, wish me luck.

How are you “showing” ppl how to drive and blasting your radio at the same time 🙄 makes no sense.
Try to speak slowly and clear English please. Not everyone watching your videos is an American. Especially blacks. They have heavy accent which is difficult for most international students to understand. Thank you 😊

This video is bs. I just failed.
I failed my road test twice. My instructor failed me because another driver attempted to wrongfully cut me off, and I didn't allow them too. I desperately need my driver's license for work, it was embarrassing​ for me to tell my boss I failed my road test.

For San Diego, California go to the Poway DMV. Easy test as long as you can maintain speeds of up to 35 mph on the main roads and then 25 mph in the neighborhood. Keep a good distance in between vehicle as the examiner can mark you off on it, but I passed.
is it common to fail the basic skills test that occurs before the actual driving test? I did my first time attempting it. I feel like I'm a good driver I practiced the route beforehand and did pretty good.I've drove much longer distances perfectly fine. I just panicked beforehand and failed the basic skills test. I know if i can just get on the road I'll be ok. I was just wondering who may have also failed it.

One error is your illigal spelling... LOL
Good video 👍🏽
I passed mine without watching this video tbh lol
I failed my road test 3 times. Here's the story: 1st try- I only had 2 errors, which was my bike lanes and I "slowed down too much on a green light" while turning right. 2nd try- Alright this examiner told me I couldn't go right on a red stoplight even though its legal in my state. Then she told me one of my other errors is the pedestrian crossing. Pedestrians were crossing the road. In my state we're allowed to proceed when a pedestrian has crossed HALFWAY of the crosswalk (which I did). 3rd time- This examiner basically told me the complete opposite of what the 2nd examiner told me, Which is why I failed.  My 4th try is coming this Thursday and I'm getting really frustrated about getting my license. Is there ANY possible tips anyone here can give me beforehand?
I'm taking mine tomorrow morning, OMG I am so nervous! Please wish me good luck.
I just failed mine because of parallel parking lol
Roll up ur damn window so I can hear you
Took mine today, thanks I passed first try :)

I drive a Ford Explorer but I'm thinking I should use my mom's Toyota Corolla because it is smaller. What do y'all think I should do? Also any tips I should know about?
This was a perfect video, thank you very much man.

I Pass Mines In One Try☺️
omg we live close by lmao
I'm scared about hitting that curb man. When we reverse do we put a hand behind the passanger seat and look back? Or do we leave both hands in the steering wheel? Also if you're making a right turn at an intersection and there is a bus stopped in front of you, do you stop and wait for the bus to move or do you go around?
Just noticed.... you are at the forum !!
i needed to watch this thanks for the tips 👍
On my first driving test I passed with 96! I'm happy AF right now. Good luck to anybody else getting ready to take the test.
Or, maybe you could turn off your music.

taking mines tomorrow wish me luck..😐
useful tips! Thanks
When turning, right or left, when there is only one turn lane into a four lane road (where there are two going in each direction), you MUST turn into the closest one. If you turn left, you must turn into the left lane and may only get into the right lane after you have made it into the left lane and prepare for a lane change.
If your gonna be talking in the video atleast turn off your stupid whack music. I can say how annoying it is whem people talk with stupid music in the background
i feel like i suck at driving. i got my permit about 5 months ago and im 17. idk what it is i think its just cause im new to driving or not but i im pretty scared when driving and  go to slow every once is a while. its very discouraging..
Great video but my instructor alwats says you must stay in the far left lane when making a left turn even when there's two lanes cause a vehicle could make a right turn into the same road you want to turn.

Found this video tonight, my test is tomorrow at 2:30 pm. Fingers crossed that i pass, though i hear that they never pass male drivers their first time, even if they did really well, so there's that. Hopefully thats not the case
lol I was so nervous that the first thing I did was press the gas while the car was still in park. I admitted that I was a little nervous. Didn't make the best first impression, but my road test instructor didn't seem fazed. Once I started driving I calmed down and everything went well! Passed with flying colors! I watched your video beforehand and it helped.
I passed thanks to you man
I have test tomorrow wish me luck
taking my test in two hours wish me luck hope I pass
Got a test in 4 hours! I' m nervous, wish me luck everyone!
I passed this was helpful
Failed the 1st test. I stopped before the stop line, waited 3 seconds, and then I crept forward slightly because there were bushes blocking my view of the road. My road test person assumed that when I started to creep forward that I was going to floor it instead of coming to a complete stop (I was absolutely going to stop, but unfortunately she jumped the gun and thought I wasn't going to stop). Like htf am I supposed to see the road without inching forward? Took it again with a different person, and this time when I reached the same stop sign, I stopped for 3 seconds & I said out loud, "okay I'm going to creep forward a bit and stop again because my view is currently obstructed." I did this for pretty much every flippin' stop sign (& right on red) on the test. lol at the end of the test the guy goes "you didn't have to tell me what you were going to do at every single stop" and I said "Believe me....Yes. I. Did" BTW I passed it. :D
You are gorg lmbo, I'm in line to take mine now 😁
Great video, I got lots of notes thank you!

Inglewooooooood
Damn you were right outside the forum huh
i live area or Crenshaw thats wassup
I have my driving test in a couple days and I have two questions. My first question is can I just use my mirrors and back up camera to go on reverse and just check for a car behind me ? Since I have a camaro, the rear view visibility is terrible. And my second question is, may I make a slight wider turn when leaving or entering the parking lot ? Reason is because on the camaro the visibility is terrible on my lower right side of my car and I can't see the curbs. I just don't want to hit a curb by accident which I haven't so far but I don't want to get unlucky and fail my test.
When you go to back up do you keep both hands on the wheel or put on hand behind you ?
My test is in 3 hours, ahhh!
Aye inglewood I'm from there
im only 11 and i have a 5 year heads up
I have my test today 😁

Thank you so much for the video. Helped me out a lot
Thanks For The Video!!!!!😄
Thanks For The Video!!!!!😄
oh man I was driving a bit ago and so many douchebags were being "that guy" that sped and passed me illegally. that is why it is critical to just focus on yourself and make sure you're doing everything right. I will be taking my driving test by the end of this month or the very begining of next month.
from a country that drives on the left side.. this was slightly confusing lol
Thx I passed!
Thanks for the vid! Very helpful. I have my test tomorrow, I hope I pass since it's my first time.
3:26 "illigal left turn" well done.
Thanks for this. Took you 7 minutes to explain what most driving videos explain in 20 minutes.
my test is in 2 hours.
thanks!
This is BS! Fuck Obama for making this test to hard!
thanks for the tips
Thanks a lot for making this video! I passed my driving test today using the tips you gave us.
Braking in neutral or with the clutch in is another critical error.
hey do you go to csun?
Very informative video, Thank you!  My test is today and this helped me relax and remember what I need to do.

Inglewood 😎
My test is tommorow
thanks man. im taking test tomorrow.
congrats for your first 1M vieuw :)
I have my road test in 4 days and I'm so nervous! Especially for parking (perpendicular and parallel) because I get really nervous and always mess up!
I failed yesterday because as I was in the parking lot at the end of my test waiting for an old man to slowly cross in front of me so I could turn and go park, a truck decided to start backing up without looking behind him and almost backed into me. I didn't notice him as I was waiting there for the old guy to cross and so the tester had to honk the horn to get him to stop. He felt really bad after I parked because I drove almost perfectly and he said I deserved to pass, but he had to fail me because technically he "took control." Hopefully better luck next time.
I take my driving test next saturday, im constantly watching this video!
Inglewooodd & Crenshaaw!!!
Not sure if it was mentioned before ( you have lots of comments!). But don't cross your hands over when turning.  That's a fail too!  You have to 'feed the steering wheel pushing up into the other hand it down into the other hand.  Great video !
Seeing how were both black men I know this is weird but is the test different for those that are white, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American?
im scared im taking my driving test tomorrow and omg im starting to think i shouldn't take it
i only subscribed cause i rember your tutorials on how to get waves and you have waves if i fail my test ill unsubscribe
Should I stop once or twice at a stop sign? My instructor said twice for certain ones.
I drive stick. do a stick version
I have my driven test today, I hope I pass. Thanks for the tips
don't be that guy
my test is on Friday and I've never been so nervous.. yet I still feel confident. :/
that was very informative. I hope this helps me.

OMG I just loved when you said DON'T BE THAT GUY  thanks for this video
6:17 why did he turn isn't it a red light
You're so handsome lol those grammatical errors though 👀 lol and when big rigs hit you expect to get paaaid!
one error is that damn music lol
Critical Error #1 : Don't be a black man driving a nice car
Too cautious is an error?? Wtf is that?!? Rather be too cautios than b wreckless
When you take the test does the instructor tell you what to do or you showing him?
He's at the forum in Inglewood

My test is in fifteen days and I haven't been taught\learned how to parallel park or gone on the freeway.  I'm done
I have a drivers test tomorrow morning and I'm freaking out!! I have a question about the left turning lanes. If there are two left turning lanes going into a 3 lane road, which lane does the car in right left-turning lane drive into? The middle or the far right lane?
My test is tomorrow, I'm nervous 🙈
This is so great thank you for this information!
I have my test today, so nervous lol.
Googled Driving test tips and this came up first, great advice and halfway through I realized he was driving through my hood of all places! haha thumbs up for sure.
Why your eyes so glazed bro? 😂😂
I have a question by the way. In an intersection where there is a dedicated right turn with a yield sign. If there are no pedestrians crossing but there is oncoming traffic. Do I stop behind the crosswalk and wait til its clear?
Taking my test on Wednesday here in Salinas!

Idk how i ended up here, nj on showing these errors, but man.. xD kinda hard to hear you with the music, it's cool in-between cuts and stuff, but just have it off when you're talking, other then that, good luck!
Failed my test because I did not yield to make unprotected left turn. Make sure to yield guys! Taking it again in about 2 weeks.

This comes in handy since I'm going into my sophomore year, thanks bro
I just passed my Driving test! I was so nervous. I scored a 97! The administrator said my parallel parking is the best she's seen in years. A few tips i can give people would be to observe your surroundings. Even if there's nothing going on, make it look like you are really observing. ALWAYS look over your shoulders before changing lanes. Keep your head and eyes in motion always. Signal when turning. Never drive more than 5 miles above and below the posted speed limit. ALWAYS and I repeat ALWAYS come to a complete stop at a stop sign or red light; no rolling over!! Just remember to keep calm everything will fall into place when you follow the rules of the road. Now i kick myself for being so nervous, cuz i didn't have to. Good luck!!!
My test is Saturday morning and this helped me feel at ease. We don't have a lot of pedestrians where I live, so I wouldn't know the rules about them if I did see some.  I'll be conscious about these things while I'm practicing for and taking my test.
Can I make a suggestion ~ Do you mind showing us a 3 point turn if you do get a vehicle. I'm having trouble focusing on that particular topic. I have never taken my driver's test yet.
you should shut your windows so we don't here the wind planes and sirens and turn the music off
I have a question, lets say my light is green like in your video 5:20 and there are no pedestrians do I still need to stop before the white line in the intersection? Or can I just go through and turn right without stopping?  Also lets say there are cars on the opposite side of me wanting to turn in the same way im going, im in the corner and there in their turn lane and their is no arrow, who has the right of way to go first?
Do i HAVE to look over my shoulder to change lanes
I didn't know that if pedestrians were so far that you still had to wait for them to safely cross the street.
I'm 16 about to turn 17 on next Wednesday and I'm taking my drivers test this fall
Thank you :)
Ima Take My Driver License Test Soon , I'm So Nervous Ugh 😩
This video would have been so much better had you turned the music off while recording.
This is really helpful! Thumbs up.
Nice video. I swear this is Inglewood.
thanks haha these critical errors are worth knowing, wish me luck !
You spelt illegal wrong my dude 😐
Nice waves man. I'm trying to get my shit like that
critical ERRORS

Hey man im taking my driving behind the wheel test tomorrow thanks for the tip!

Seatbelt dick head

Ayee thats the forum parking lot 🙌
You should never try to no one anything
Boy how are you trying to teach someone how to drive with that loud ass music on
I'm taking my test tomorrow morning and I'm kind of nervous, but this video is a great refresher and made me feel more prepared. Sorry about your truck by the way!
Great vid !
I live around this area so it was a perfect video to watch to help me practice driving in the area. Thanks!
okay so if someone starts crossing the street but lights dont indicate for them to walk, but you are two lights stops away from them and speed up all the way because its green yet you see the pedestrian the whole time. Would you still have to stop regardless of the green light or is it wrong if the person started speeding just because the light was green yet someone was crossing. I saw someone do this at the school crosswalk just because it was empty and the lights were taking forever to allow us to cross but they took initiative just to cross anyway, but the car was coming from down the street, the kid was in the middle of the cross walk. They got mad and said watch where you're going and sped off when the kid was just a little bit past the car but they braked really hard at the light as if the kid magically appeared in front of the car. That was really unnecessary and dangerous on both parts but legally which one has to watch out.
take it tomorrow hope i pass brah
Take mine friday July 10th hope I pass
Taking my test today. I feel nervous but I know I will pass
Check out Lethbridge Driver's who Fail part 1,2 and 3.
Taking my test in an hour! Nervous...
black people's accent of english is so bad i couldn't even understand anything what he said But thanks to subtitles. And he drives really good If all people drive like this, I bet there will be no severe and fatal accidents, but some drivers are stupid.. like the one who overtake him in silver car
Is this Westminster? That's where I am testing!
I take my test tomorrow and I'm hella nervous. What makes it worse is that my sibling is also taking hers after mine. I swear if I fail and she passes I'm going to die. :'(
was anyone else looking at the krispy kreame sign at 5:25.......
Taking mine in the morning
taking my test tomorrow morning!
Taking my test tmw morn.
I'm glad that you mentioned pedestrians so much! Most people just ignore us, I don't have a car and walk every where and the cars don't care at all, plus the cross walk lights go off way too fast so sometimes you can't make it in time before the light changes!
Ima bump some Dom Kennedy and Ty dolla $ign to in my drivers test haha lol jk
ayyy the forum thats like 15 mins away from me! thanks for this video, im taking my drivers test tomorrow and this helped a lot!

"Don't be dat guy" haha thanks man for the lesson.
Thanks men!
ayyee, dom kennedy!
My test is next week Thursday and this will be my fourth attempt. I should have passed the first time but I got nervous and made silly mistakes. I am going in confident this time but I won't lie I do have my nervous moments. I will share my advice. 1) ALWAYS know who and what is beside you, behind you, and in front of you. I failed my second test because my eyes were glued in front of me and I wasn't scanning enough. 2) Have a good distance from parked cars. I failed my 3rd time partially because I was too close to parked cars during my parallel parking then when I was exiting I didn't reverse and nearly hit the car in front of me. 3) Trust your judgement. The main reason I failed my 3rd time was because it was raining and the mirrors and windows were foggy. I knew I should have put on the defogger but I was so sure I was going to fail a 3rd time that I just didn't care. 4) Stay calm :) Nobody is perfect I guarantee that I as well as many others will make mistakes on this test BUT if you made one small error, it isn't the end of the world. Shake it off. I am very happy to have a chance to be able to drive on my own but this time my nerves won't get the best of me
My test is today and I was scanning the critical errors. I'm fairly nervous because I tend to go a bit slow and stop a bit far back when I see other cars stopping. I'm kind of nervous, but the nerves won't kick in until I'm with that driving instructor!
I swear everyone was trying to interrupt you. First the plane, then the fire trucks. :P
I'm from New Jersey and omfg, my friend failed the first road test because he had a "bitchy" instructor said my friend. So it's better to have a nice instructor... Greater chance of passing.
Oh my!! Im going to have my road exam two days from now and but i  can't even make a proper turn ..!!!! It's always confuses me how much should i turn ...
Just passed mine today easiest thing ever
I just watched this. Now I am leaving to go take my driving test . HOPE I PASS! WISH ME LUCK GUYS!
i take my test tomorrow! thanks for the tips. i hope i pass
thanks i needed this, because my parents don't teach me how to drive and i have a test next monday.
I got my driving test tomorrow morning and I'm confident about passing. The only thing I'm worried about is backing up.
AY! Slauson and crenshaw
Thats the forum! :)
Man ive made all 10 of these critical errors when driving before i guess i need a lot more practice
The only reason I did not pass was because I must always drive on the bike line to make a turn unless there is someone
Thanks for making this video I've been driving for 9 years now and i still make some of these mistakes.
omg I taking it tommorow I'm so fucking scared thanks for the tips
This really helped me cause i have a driving test today and am kinda nervous about it but i think i can do it :DD

How Many Errors (Maximum) Can you Miss To Pass.?
I doubt if you should turn your music on the radio while taking your driving test.

Thanks for this video! :) I've got my test on Thursday and even tho I've been driving since December, I'm still suuuuuper nervous lol!
You have shiny eyes.
Taking my test next weekend, I'll be sure to remember these tips, thank you so much!
Can you put a video on how to parallel part? The tips you gave on this video was so helpful.. Thanks
This looks like the stadium in San Andreas
Taking my test Friday
I just passed my test first go, and the best piece of advice I can give anyone about to take it is just see the instructor as a guy you have to give a ride. He will tell you where to go, and tell you to do something that you aren't actually supposed to ( like park on this red curb kinda thing) but just stick to what you know and you'll be ok. Start a brief conversation if you can to ease the tension. They aren't bad people and they don't want to fail you; they are however probably bored as hell of watching people drive all day...Good luck to everyone!
Good video friend!
I'm a little nervous on taking mines soon. But this really helped.   Thanks
At the forum lol
Thank you
Making me miss Cali watching this lol
its scary how easy the nj test is
I am taking my test this saturday.. I feel ok with it, I am just nervous for my parking in the cones.. I park ok, I just know if I hit a cone I fail and I can not have that!!  Does anyone know the best way to do perpendicular parking?? Like if its on your right and you have to turn right into it.. I think I have a good method, but Dont know if I run over the lines..
Took my test last Friday and passed on my first try! My license already came in the mail your video helped a lot thank you.

I take my test May 5th and I pray that everyone that tales their test pass and so do I. God is good everyone just keep practicing and let us put our confidence in Christ.
Inglewood always up to no good
Great informative video. I am going to take my drivers road test by next week. Good thing is, it is super rare for people to be out walking in south Texas, so I do have to worry about that critical error. There are crazy drivers from Mexico here though that just about evens it up. One question though, if I remember right about what my ex said, up is for the right blinker and down is for the left right? Oh and one more, is parallel parking hard?
I'M TAKING MY TEST TOMORROW AND IM FLIPPING OUT RN :( :( :(
Strange how most of these American drivers have automatic gears
Thanks bruh
Q
I'm taking my test on Monday at Westminster, Wish me luck. Thank you for the tips
Today was my second time taking driving lessons. I am slowly coming out of my shell. The first time I was so stiff I was really nervous. I think I might need 20 lessons lol, But thank you for this video!!
Taking my test tomorrow, I'm pretty nervous... Thanks for this awesome video!
Dom Kennedy! And my hometown Inglewood!

6:31, that Tasty Q ? Always used to get turkey necks from there.
Ohh shit , Crenshaw !
You look like you're in Compton
Dope video, thanks man you helped me a lot
smh you was right by my house.. I was like hey that US Bank is on Jefferson. And who could forget Inglewood. Grew up there.. Anyway, this video was helpful. I'm this year and I will be having my road test for the first time. I've had my permit 3 times but unfortunately I kept letting them expire. This time, I will put it to use and get my license. I've never taken the road test, so I've been doing lots of research and trying to get some practice in. I'm going to be test at the Culver City DMV, I heard it's one of the best ones to go to besides the Inglewood one. I've heard the staff at Inglewood can be a bit much sometimes though. It's been easy to get around since I ride my bike pretty much everywhere, but there are moments where I wish I had a car, and so, I am going to go for it. Thanks for sharing!
rashad when the "pretest" comes up what do you do? and btw my test is april 17th

Good video ... i liked how you gave examples from the cars around you!  *illegal
Thank u very much for this!!! I feel less nervous!!! Xoxo
my first advice coming out the parking lot for a new driver would be stop behind the line and check for pedestrians. golden rule #1 then blinker and creep up while checking traffic.
Good video even though the sound isnt the best, i didnt know you have to wait for a pedestrian to cross if they are on the oppisite side of you, i thought only if they are on the same side. Thanks.
This is how I learned to "Get comfortable with driving", They handed me the keys to their little generic car and told me to 'Drive'. And yet I wonder how the car only has a few dents. These were helpful thanks!
Checkout Part 2 of this video here - How to Parallel Park to Pass your Driving Test: https://youtu.be/xqDLI9QIaNA and follow me on IG too request videos @RashaadRahh

Oh and I'm taking my test in Glendale, CA 91204
I see most of you guys posted saying you guys had a test and passed, I have my test on 3/19/15 and my car (my car I bought I've been fixing up) is lowered because it's a 93 integra da9 jdm (: but it always scrapes coming off curbs of really anything cuz it's so low, my question is will get points marked off? I'm 18 btw...
You look 29
I'm 16 and I'm taking my driving test on the 9th of March 😂 Thank you so much for this video. I'm excited and nervous at the same time.
I take my test today! This is why I'm up watching the videos! haha

Yo bro your video is on point ! I'm taking my test in 24 days ! I'm so nervous! Can you make a video on parallel parking ?
is this learn how to drive for nigguhs??? lmao
Thank you for your help man!!!
after watching this vid I passed my test for the first time! Most important is when you right turn always check the bike lane before making turn, always look at mirror when pressing brake , Do not pass the white line in a stop sign.
taking my test in a couple hours, super nervous i feel like i khow it all but at the same time i feel like ima forget everything when im there.. i hope i pass watched this video like 100 times no lie man
goin for mine friday and i really hope i get it
HA!!!! This video should be what they're showing people in Maryland! Especially at 6:30! I've been taking the bus for going on 9 years now, now and I'm finally going to get my license in a few months. In Maryland we actually have bright white pedestrian signs. That's OUR right of way. But like you said, people are so terrible that they'll try and beat you into the street. And in your video the pedestrian was coming from across the street. There are many times where I get my white light and a person decides to turn before I put a step into the street. How rude! Especially when it's snowing and you have your hood up, it's almost like a blind spot. I promise that I'll always give pedestrians the right of way. Yeah, it's the law, I know, but it's also about not being a jerk!
Tomorrow is test day!...
Thanks a lot man your video was helpful I'm taking my road test today and just by watching this video I feel confident that I'm going to pass and come home with my license. Once again thank you you're such a helpful person just for that I'm going to subscribe ya page man.
Thanks, I subscribed. What's the song at 6:50 bro?
I take mine tomorrow!!!

very insightful, thank you!
Thanks! Subscribed!
Can you shoot the address for that big parking lot?
Thanks thanks i passed it  with your help
What about merging. Can I make a immediate left turn if the incoming traffic is clear or even do the incoming traffic is clear I still need to stop in the middle of the merge and then I turn left.
DOM KENNEDY
Thanks for the video It helo me a lot
When i take a right turn, do i stay stay in the inside lane?
My test coming this Months february 27 / 2015
Saw this before taking my test and I passed, thanks for the tips man.
I'm going for mine tomorrow and I'm shit scared of failing!!!
any galaxy XD
Yesterday I went for Behind the wheel test. I failed. She said I was driving faster.  This NFS ruined all this exam.
Thanks a lot for this video. I just got my driving permit, just started practising to drive but so scared and I keep forgetting to turn on the is signal. And i keep turning the wheel too much, I hope I get better.
Is it the same on Michigan?
Dang that's real good tips. Perfect with this.
I take my test next Friday, I hope I pass.... I have had my permit for 6 months and in Kentucky you can get your intermediates(you can drive alone and have one non-family member passenger) after 6 months of your permit and a road test.
It was a good video it was just annoying trying to hear what you were saying because the music was blasting.
Thanks for the help bro! I'm happy to say that I passed today.

im nervous for parallel parking ive only done it 3 times and i got it on the 3rd try..  also im a little bit nervous for round abouts and the sharp turns other then that i can do the highway and on main roads good. i plan on taking another set of classes but the downfall is that they only last for 5 days and are 3 hours long but they are the only ones available since im 20 :/
thank you i live in inglewood.
I had my road test yesterday....I passed first time.....it was really easy. Good thing about Florida is that there is no parallel parking....thanks Shaad....your video helped me a lot.

thnks
Crenshaw Blvd, Louisiana Fried chicken. Brings back so many memories from when I lived in California!! Gardena for life
I'm honestly terrified as I'm going for my drivers test (again) tomorrow, after failing the first time during parallel parking. I feel like here in PA they put way to much emphasis on parallel parking, and everyone around here fails at least once before passing. This video helped tho, and I'm reassured I'll be able to pass this time.
Please how do I reverse and parallel park?.
Thank you for sharing your video. I didn't  really need to drive in NY. But it is a must to drive out here in Orlando. I sure need all the tips, that I can get.
Thanks man! The video is really helpful. I've been doubting myself especially since my driving test is in a week or so LOL.
Thanks a lot for the tips, I have my permit, and a car, now i just need  the license lol no more shady business :)
I thought for number 2 they want you to to take the road closest to you when making a turn
ugh im taking my test tomorrow. Im so nervous! hopefully i pass :)
I know where you at bro , I went to inglewood last year.  Lol can you spell check tho,  And yo music in most yo videos too loud but Keep going!! btw my last name Rashad!
Thank You. I hope i pass soon!(:

Taking my test today. The only thing I am worried about is parallel parking. I went and practiced in a big truck yesterday and seemed to get it. But thank you for the tips video.
Awesome.  Great help. Many thanks
inglewoooood
Thank you for this video, refreshers on the rules are really helpful. I hope I pass tomorrow!

Hey man, thanks for the video, that makes things easier.
What's your IG?
Well I have a question, if I have my permit on the date 06/25 and I am under 18. Do I need to wait until the date 12/25 ( 6 months ) or I can start my driving test on the beginning of December like 12/15 ?
Good job bro my road test is tomorrow thanks... I will cop my license
Still listening to the yellow album in 2014 lmao yes lawd!

tomorrow is my day...help me God #Nervous
I was focused more on your handsome face than the video.... :-(
i have a driving test in 3 days and i'm so nervous
Thanks. I'm taking my test tomorrow, hopefully I pass! I'm a little nervous but fairly confident..
your video is awesome! please check your left turns when yield cars because you cannot block the interception (you wait for the oncoming that came toward you "perfect" but.. the 1st black car that  made the left turn didn't wait because you weren't moving) "If drivers approaching from opposite directions reach an intersection at about the same time, a driver that turns left must yield to traffic that moves straight or turns right. "It's a matter of seconds"  you have proceeded first because it is your turn do not doubt....I  think you only yield the cars that are going strait and making right turns ..but if you see ahead its left signal and tha car is approaching do not hesitate and go, that car has to slow down a little bite but you proceeded safety enough, but net time according with the rule go ahead and make your turns quickly and with out doubt. one again I think you also have to creep I little more when you are waiting for your turn and complete right away quickly. THANK YOU FOR YOU VIDEO sorry for my grammar mistakes!
Yo Rashaad thanks for the video man. You were real calm, and straight-forward with the video, and good editing too.  This video helped me out with my studying for the driving test, and now I got my license.  Preciate it fam
Thanks for this video. I am 24 but I only got a permit to drive I am not ready for a road test yet. Driving is my biggest fear in life I am from Philippines which most of the people there don't own a car. We have a lot of public transportation in the Philippines so when I get here I was kind of shock because we live in Cleveland TN and we don't have public transportation. You video of is very helpful.
Avoid the inglewood dmv! Too many hills and holes :(
You were at the beautiful forum :P it's good to practice in Hollywood park indeed lol.
