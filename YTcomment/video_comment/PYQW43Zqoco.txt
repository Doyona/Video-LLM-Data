So old
This video helped me start my string art business 👏🏽 Can't thank you enough💪🏽💛
Such a great video! Thank you for sharing! I have a few questions. Do you use Paint 3D, Paint Universal, or another version? What size font are you using for your template in this project? I think that is all! lol
what software are you using to make the stencil?
Зачем так усложнять?
This is a valuable addition to my woodwork collection https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxkNYRBJuiJ6EwD-tQSAlxg0eFKsnR2cgz  I still will rate this woodwork plan as the best in my reference library. It always seem to stand out from the rest whenever you go through the library. This is a masterpiece.

Thank you for making the video. It will be my first time. Your detailed info and helpful hints were the best I have watched. I appreciate all you did to help explain it. 🌺
I did something like this a month ago with plans from Stodoys.
I have seen several videos on making string art and none of them can compare to yours. Love all the tips! Beautiful result 😍
how to make string art is cool 😎
great work
From start to finish, how long did it take?  I have had people ask me to do this for them. Until now I really didn't have a clue where to start.  Thank you for the video!
What is the font and the font size please
There are many similar projects in Woodprix's plans.
Hei this vedio is very helpful for me... please upload more vedios about wood and string art step by step ideas or trick's  for beginners.
Amazing 😍
I remember you saying what type of wood your using. But now it’s slipped my mind and can’t find the part when u said it lol.  What type of wood do u use?   Great job by the way! Started doing string art and ur method is by far the nicest!
What's a Heinle?
Why do you prefer cedar?
Nice..
WHAT FONT NAME DID YOU USED?
Hey!  It is one of the best I have seen!  I specially like the vintage touch of the wood!
What type of wood do you need to do string art?
This is the best string art video I've seen, thank you! What type of wood would you suggest using? Also you sound like Ron Swanson, it's awesome!
Best tutorial still! Thanks for the detail!
Super cool, but looks like it’s better tedious
This reminds me of rubber bands and shapes in elementary. I loved how it turned out!
What kind of cedar is that? Looks like flooring planks. Can you buy this at a big box store?
this is a great tutorial , but one question i can't make the font bigger than 72 could someone help me
A tactical west for art. Murica is proud
What string would be reccomended?
What is the thickness of the wood?
What font was used? I went to dafont site but couldn’t find it.
Wow!!  Great job and nice tutorial!  Glad you used yarn because I have a lot of that!  Thanks!!
Wow! Beautiful and well explained👍
Thanks for sharing.. looking forward to trying my first piece.
Love your Video!! Great job... May I ask what size font you used? I’m in the process of making one similar and need a little advice. Thank you
"My good hammer" haha cute
what type of wood are you using ?
I bought excellent handbook from woodprix website. Just google woodprix and make some dust.
What kind and how much string do you use on projects like this?
Nice.
I love you
Awesome 😎
What font did you use?
“The ladies love em” lol cute 💕
how many string do I need for like the same size as you
Awe you’re the best. Thank you. This has been the most helpful tutorial so far.
Watched your video and knocked my first one out of the park. Thanks!
my classmates and I want to make a tree for our teacher. and this vedio was very helpful thank you sir
Great video. I learned a lot thank you.
How much would you say this costs to make?
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
thank you nice job
Thanks for sharing❤
What was the font size u used?
Before I pressed play, your expression with mouth wide open makes it look like you have dropped something on your foot. Great video by the way. Well done.
Genuinely enjoyed how realistic this was. I've been wanting to try string art, but after seeing how similar the process is to that time I made a geoboard (and hated every second of it), I'm thinking this probably isn't the project for me!
He needs to pant the backboard black and the nails. Then use phosphorescent string and outline the boarder of the backboard with a blacklight led strip. That would kick this up into a different demographic , maybe for home bars signs and game rooms.
Thanks for the great tutorial! What kind of wood is that? I know you said cedar, but what do I ask for at the store? Sorry if I missed it in the video
It is a "painfully awful" process. I've done two & they turned out great, but all those nails!
What is the font you used in this video?
does anyone know which font he was using?
Thank you
I was gonna make stirring art       but then I got high. . .
Heinle-unique name
Crafts with Eyeore lol. You sound sick of your life
Just thinking... you could have some LEDs in between the top and the bottom lines... so the writing could be illuminated from behind.
Just subbed man keep up the good work. Love the detail I'm going to try myself. Check me out sometime.
the best artwork for Slow children.
And the ladies love you! You’re a hottie. Lol. ☺️
What kind of wood is better for this?
Did you know you can have access to all your accounts on your messanger? You can get daily updates on your balances and see where your moneys going, how much you have made this week and have cash back on simple things!   https://meetcleo.com/referrals?code=cleo--Qykmw
How long did it take to finish
Great video!
Cool idea dude. I think I'm gonna make this voor my eldest kid too.
Nice! Still have my childhood string art! Great job!
Never seen this done so well. I didnt like the string art until I saw this. Great job! Im going to try one.
Awesome❣️👍🏼 I love the idea of having the yarn extended from above 😊 wow making it so much easier to work with ❣️❣️❣️❣️ thanks for the tips and video ❣️👍🏼😊
Disappointed your handsome face is cut out of most of the video.
Clicked this video thinking that said "henti" and I was like "What in tarnation?!" Nope. Just my dyslexia.
That was really helpful thank you i want to try and do something like that for my nephew and i wanted to ask you what thickness is the wood you are using and nail length please ?
Can anyone help me with the font style used?
I'm making this type of thing for the pops. Thanks so much for the guide!
Perfect tutorial. Very easy to see and understand. I especially like that you has an error and were able to show us that it was no big deal.  We are about to try our first string art project and this being the first video I watched, I seriously doubt we will need to look for any more. Great video!
Great job, told me everything I needed to know
Do you have any suggestions on where to purchase the wood?
wtf https://www.etsy.com/shop/DopeArtStudio
Well you sure are highly motivated... 😂 But great tutorial, thank you!
Is quite easy
I made this in school today
Did you paint the nails after they were all nailed in, during the jump cut? If so, what do you use?
What an interesting idea)))) I have on my channel a new video in the technique of string art, I will be glad to guests)))) with me like)))
I am far from an expert, but if you're really concerned about printer ink you should use a program like GIMP. It gives you greater control over text, and if you want just an outline, then you can outline the text and use less ink. Also do lots of other fun stuff too like learn to use paths, etc. etc. It's a free dupe of PhotoShop.
How long did it take you?
First time on your channel and I have to say you’re a very attractive guy. Seeing a guy doing something like this is oddly attractive to me... I didn’t know until now lmao.
I am making a going away gift for a friend who is moving. Do you have any recommendations to about wrap 12x12 square plaques of string art?
Top Banana!
Clear and concise. Helpful. Thanks.
Awesome tutorial! Great job! ❤❤❤
That's so rad
7:21    mood
This is super cool. .. But it's an art I'd never do because it would piss me off. Similar to dot Mandela's
I was taught this in JR High about 45 years ago😂
I'm  having Vacation Bible School kids do this project in a cross shape next week! Cant wait!
Thanks for sharing.  You made it seem so simple.
This is brilliant. Very helpful and informative. You’d have to be pretty dumb to not understand your instructions. I think you taught well. Thank You. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I've done a couple of these before. I love your idea of having a eye hook above your work area to hold the string I will have to do that.   I just do simple words like Welcome, Home, Love and so on so I have one temple per word and reuse it.   Awesome job on yours.
Faça com legendas se possível, estou assistindo do Brasil 💚💛
How do I hang this on the wall?
Thank you so much....this way of threading makes it look a lot more intricate...
Great art...
Wow that looks so good!
Thank you sooooo much for showing us this video!  Alot of 'sting-art' videos state that there is NO method to the madness (as one quoted).  They looks super messy when they were done.  You actually have a method to the string art madness.  Your finished string art is beautiful!  It is clean, has straight lines and doesn't look crappy.  Some uploaders were using crochet cotton which is super thin ( the string used to crochet doilies).  I wonder what bulky yarn would look like... I don't think I would get a beginning and ending outline including the filler, with the size of nail u used, lol!  I would need a 2" nail!  It would probably look great on a huge sign tho.  Tfs!
Node tool irl. 🤦🏾‍♀️😂
Thanks seems like a cool project to start. Looks great
I like 😍
Looks gr8 that is hard work you definetly need a drink after that
Great job, would you mind giving the name of the font you used? THX
how do you make the font so big and take up so much space?? Help!!
Do you spray with a sealant or anything afterward to keep the yarn from getting dirty or is getting dirty part of the aging effect or doesn't it matter either way?
what kind of wood is the best to do string art? Because i have used pine but some places are to expensive. Any Tips Please
Good job man. Have to try this once..
love it!  Great job.
Wouldn’t a nail gun be faster ?
What kind of cedar is that? I thought cedar was red/orange.
To save ink in making your stencil AND make the font wider, add a thin outline in light gray and then change your text to white.  Your final result will look like a pencil outline of your letters.  You will know EXACTLY where to place the nails.
dear god I wish I had seen this month's ago. I'm using 3874 nails (not actually) doing small pieces..like 10x10-12" and it takes me a lifetime. and haven't had a technique for outlining. creating shortcut to this vid on desktop lol thanks for sharing!
Most detailed version I’ve seen. Thank you
I love the hope and tricks! Super laid back and straight to the point! My type of guy... Subscribiiiing now
You're hot, you're funny and you're talented. Terrible qualities in a guy.  Jk awesome job, this looks amazing!
Hi Mike, when you run out of thread, how do you hide the attachment? ok you answered my question, one letter at a time.
How long total did this take to do?
Hi ! I have the same scissor and good work !👍🏻😍😃😊
2:02 and to save black ink, the cheapest one there is, i use colour, which is more expensive and all that bs nice u could've put grey instead of light blue
“Pull it out with a tweezer”  How big are your eyebrows, dude?
Pretty straight forward project but looks nice anyway. One question: Could you use spray glue or spray paint at the finished project, so when it gets dry you could get rid of the nails and the board? I am thinking of seperate letters filled with an led strip and would like to know if this method could be used for this task. Thanks beforehand and keep up the nice work
Don't nail into the paper. I use a push pin to push holes into the paper and then take the paper off and do my nails.
You talk a lot \\(一_一)//
nice recovery the mark of excellence.  Nice job
It’d be cool if there was a way to add lighting to the letters
This looks great! :) But, America needs to adopt the metric system!
Great thing u made ❤️❤️
So this question probably goes beyond a "string art" tutorial but I'm struggling with the stencil. I'm following your instructions but just can't get my font to fill the 3x1 pages. Any chance you go into a little bit more detail on creating the stencil from step 1?
10:38 you missed part of the H for the outline.....
Beautiful!
Beautifully done!!!
Damn... that’s cool. Such patience. Looks awesome.
What kinda string is better to use? Which thread is easy to clean and dust?
Hard to NAIL       Don't SCREW it up
فن جميل حقيقي 👍😍
Awesome
By far the best tutorial on nail string art. A lot of the other videos try to teach it in under 3 min. Thank you for your great video!
What size font did you use.
can you please give me the name of the font you used? this is so cool btw
Hey Mike, might be embarking on the string art journey soon! this video was a great intro. Should I be worried about splitting wood with all those nails? Is predrilling holes a waste of time?
Please reply I need this project done before Sunday morning
How do you make the stencil ? On MS paint mine doesn’t want to work with that font
You are a FABULOUS teacher.  Thank you so much...I have always wanted to do this, string art....now I am 68 and retired and I can get right into it.  You must have been doing this for a long time...you are very good.  Thanks for sharing.  This is my husbands "email" We haven't quite figured out how to do a separate email for me...I hope I see more of your creatations....sincerely, Linda
Do you have a link for the wood
Could you give me the dimensions of the cedar from Home Depot
ahhhhhhhmazing!  <3 <3 <3 <3
How do you set up the text on the paint page? Add a textbox? What size font did you use?
Thank you for this!  I recently started trying out string art.  I seem to have issues keeping my nails straight.  The last time I tried one, half of them were straight up and down, then half of them ended up angled just a bit so I gave up on it.  Any tips?
Do you just use regular basic yarn for the string?
So glad I found your video. Never heard of string art before. Will definitely be trying this. You stayed on topic and and kept me entertained the entire time. Didn't even realize it was an 18 minute video!! Great job. Subscribed.
What's the name of this font?
Will this work on Photoshop too?
Oddly enough, I was about to do 2 of these as gifts, and when i saw your IG post, I decided to wait for you video. Thanks man for the tips!
Very cool. I will have to try this. Thanks for sharing.
Looks awesome Mike!!!! You do good work man!!
Something different  but stands out! good job! thanks
Perhaps the best "how to" video I've seen yet. Great job and thanks!
That was Awesome! I feel I could attempt something like that. Do you get Cedar tongue and groove and then stain it? Could you use stained or distressed pine?
Do you do any signs of pictures?  Like doing your logo?  That would be pretty cool.  Thanks for the tips.
Hey, where's the beginning?
