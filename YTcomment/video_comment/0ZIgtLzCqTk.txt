Question? Most things you are buying come in plastic containers. Doesn’t that bother you?
For a 78 year old woman the music is distracting. Been watching your video😊
Hi, my name is Richard. I’ve been watching your show and noticed that you always go over what actually good for you and what is actually bad for you and to stay away from please show more of that and especially about the beef and the fresh ground beef, different type of chicken, I appreciate you going over there. I had no idea about the water chicken and about the air dry chicken but keep up the good work. I’ll be watching your show more often. Thank you and God bless.😊
The OG Costco video
Can you tell me the best air fryer to get from cost o
Where do you get your T-shirts from?
"No one needs that much booty in their life..."  Speak for yourself, pal.  😂😂😂
How can you possibly use these massive size bags of food before they go bad or rancid? Most of the stuff you covered I have never ever bought. Guess I don't know how to bake or cook.
You need vitamin D supplements Bobby, everything else is optional
I’m so glad you brought pup costcos organic eggs! I bought them for the first time today and expected the yolks to be much darker and tastier than experienced.. didn’t notice much of a difference compared to regular eggs. Won’t buy again
Thank you. But unless the nut butter are organic they absorbed too much glyphosate right
I noticed that the yolk of the Vital farms is bright yellow maybe higher nutrition content
🤣😂🤣 "Happy eggs"🤣🤣😂
B Ha ha. Sooo funny to see Art eating costco pizza....love your videos 😃
The song tho 😂
Yes I have an upright freezer and I freeze all my nuts and seeds and bring them out as I need them
Hey Bobby I keep my Dried spices in the freezer now they seem to do really well for a long time
What products in Costco have crickets/cricket flour in it? This is getting bad.
Those poor rotisserie chicken are abused . Was a bulletin out on them several months back. Lots   of injured, sick birds at the "farms' where they were purchased. Very upsetting. Definitely avoid the rotisserie chicken for multiple reasons 💔
Art is awesome😀
Please give the brands of almond flour, etc. we can’t see the brand on the video and you do not mention.
Please give the brands of almond flour, etc. we can’t see the brand on the video and you do not mention.
I don't care if the chickens are happy or not. Are the happy ones still happy when they take the eggs away from them
Lol....gummies
I don't like chia seeds never
Hahahahahahaha he got hungry cool👍👍👍👍👍
Funny gassey and fart.
Lol that's so me #Bobby vibes while shopping and my bf is #Art vibes 100% . 😂 ❤️ Love when u guys make vids together!
Wow I learned so much from this video! Yes I have been buying the roasted  chickens too from Costco but not anymore after learning to read the labels and search for the harsh ingredients to avoid. Thank You for the informative information, helps a great deal!  I read everything now and take my time when I am shopping
The whistling soundtrack is really annoying!  I’m trying to watch this with the sound very low & my spouse across the room just said it was driving him crazy!
We need to comment all the PLASTIC PACKAGING!
Bobby!!! Please lose the incessant  background whistling,  I had to turn the video off!!!
Weird. My butter of choice is Kerry Gold, which is an Irish Butter-part of the British Isles. live in the UK & they don’t sell KG in Costco, but sell it in the USA.
I'm not entirely sure... But I believe it says this video is posted 3 years ago... I have your Bobby approved app and it approved suja organic cold pressed uber greens .. Only reason I tried it was because it was approved lol is it actually not a good buy or have they altered ingredients since then to make it approved?  Just curious I wont be disappointed if so lol wasnt my favorite drink lol
Don’t buy the farmed fish or shrimp..there is a documentary showing in Indonesia fish farmers pouring 5 gallon buckets of pesticides into the farmed shrimp hatchery.
Nasty oil..it is in plastic ugh don’t buy oil in plastic unless you want to eat plastic it leeches into oil..it’s from 24 different countries that hate us..LOL..really don’t want to buy food from countries we have been at war with over the last 69 years…🤪
Costco Peanut butter is not organic..and their organic brand has nasty ingredients in it..plus it is in plastic and plastic leeches into the greasy peanut butter.Try “Kinder” dry rub spice. It taste good on anything.
Why do you put the thing you drink out of in the shopping basket/ kiddie toilet? I see people putting their groceries there ..it is nasty. It’s been swabbed and tested and they found all kinds of fecal matter from baby diapers and diseases. Ugh. Think about it. You put your food there in the kiddie diaper toilet space then you go home touch the food make a sandwich whatever and cross contaminate your food with baby💩😃just sayin’🤮
The whistling is annoying, no whistling please
I have a Costco membership so I really value these Costco vids.
That Irish Butter is no Joke.  Its Delicious
Ok so… regarding the organic brown eggs… I’ve heard you speak about the “humane” label before on other animal products. The packaging of these eggs do say “Humane Certified” also “Cage Free” … so I am just wondering what the issue is, that you do not think they are good quality? 🤔
People Don’t want to hear that their brown “organic” eggs are not Good For them… it’s the epitome of denial.
I thought the almond butter at Costco was pumped with seed oils?
almond flower is your best friend no i am allergic to almond
One video you praise these and this video you’re against them. You even had that kitchen show with that other guy using these. Which is it?
Love this video
So I saw this video when it first came out and I’m rewatching it again to refresh my mind. I’ve heard so many good things about Kombucha so I’m wondering if your opinion about the drink has changed since then?
was that Alicia Keys??
I am still amazed you eat almond butter and almond flour that is not organic…just dunking your body in pesticide when you do.  Besides coffee beans those nuts are the most heavily pesticided.  And your recommendation of the pink salt supposedly from Asia but instead is some weird amalgamation of stuff…has a giant class action suit against it.
Thank you  just  watched  3  of your  videos so much  important  information  would  like  to see more
Hilarious!! Art eating pizza and hot dog! 🤣
I wouldn’t do the nut butter in plastic... it’s sealed and heated in the container
I m really enjoyed ur videos bro I am international student in Canada this help which food i buy and gain knowledge 🫂🍀
Love ure channel but wish you'd blur customers' faces for their privacy.
I bought a lot of good organic product in the Whole Foods Market  and very happy for the price and the quality , I also like it because if you bring your own shopping bags they will discount 10 ct for each bag you bring to pick up your purchase , this  Store Market is a FRIEND of the ENVIRONMENT , Walmart store should copy what each one carries his bag. The oceans are full of plastic and Americans have to change the world starting with this work.
Can you please do a Walmart one and Target and Cardenas market but as well great Costco video
Que pena no hablo inglés💙🙏
Love this channel
What about King Arthur’s gluten free flour is that a healthy flour for those that have nut allergies?
You need to speack.slowly and show the package so we can see. Thank you.
bobby you're the costco man i love you i saw you when i watched the sexy movie about colonel sanders omg i'm literally your biggest fan bobby i love you
Can we cook with extra Virgin olive oil ?
7:00 Him: you can’t go through this much amount of cumin in 6 months  Me : *laughs in Indian*
Whole Foods is a ripoff. Best to shop Costco or better yet, shop locally.
Found your channel today 9/6/21. Great info. Thank you I am gluten, dairy, soy and sugar free due to inflammation, RA, Hashimoto. I need dry crunchy foods, I was eating corn chips until this video. Any recommendations? Thank you
Love the channel. I've learned a lot. But you're dead wrong about Marianne's avocado oil. Great avocado oil right there
Thank you so much and bless you and your family. You and your family has helped me and my daughter on our new health journey 👌🙏🏼❤️
Don’t eat flax seeds if you’re male it lowers testosterone drastically
PLEASE CAN THE WHISLING SONG ,VERY ANNOYING!!!
🤡
Dumber then last time
Can’t believe how much cheaper prices are in the US as opposed to Canada .  Ridiculous!!
USDA grade "A" chicken. 😂 Grade A alrighttt
Uber green IS cold pressed 🤔 and the greens brand has little no fruit. The fruit being grapefruit WITH less then 4grams of sugar 🤷‍♀️ Suju is the ONLY commercialized juice I'll drink occasionally
You need to LOOSE the music!!
Vital farm eggs r also sold at Walmart. Cheaper.
Pine nuts from Costco from China but actually they are harvested in Sybiria, Russia.  And pine nuts from that region are the best quality.
I HAD that pine nut syndrome! Lasted about 4 days. The only thing that tasted good was sugar 😳 everything else was bitter. It was awful.
Repent , Jesus is coming back, Jesus loves you , he died so that we can live❤❤❤.
I thought I tasted sadness when I ate those eggs...now I know why.
Tropical Traditions/Healthy Traditions in which you cannot  buy in a store is the BEST!  hand processed, not machine.  Taste the best as well.
As for the vitamin aisle, you may be right however, for my elderly dad who has swallowing issues and is disabled, we use Costco brand and other band vitamins because he need them.
Quit that dumb whistling in the background
Am confused about the 'sugar water' reference with respect to pomegranate juice as there's no added sugar and it's 100% pomegranate juice from concentrate. Granted, it's always better to eat your fruit rather than drink it.
How did I Live To 70 Eating All The Un-Healthy Items You Mentioned.  Must Have Had Over 100 Chickens To Date From Costco and Never Once KerryGold Butter.
Salmon recommendations at Costco??
So so wish Costco to start selling unsalted kerrygold butter
Man I love that you have no mask. Those things are not doing anything besides making us look like sheeple. I don’t like that term but  man it makes me sad to know we will look back in time at the last year and just feel so much worse about this whole mask thing and it’s very frustrating that health care workers are really being so lax about being told to wear a face covering ! Face covering ? When were we wearing face coverings? I thought we were wearing masks and it’s important to wear the n 95 mask. Now it’s a face covering ? How about people mention that you can get bacterial infections and pneumonia by wearing these face coverings all the time. Just wanted to make sure that I said something. Think about it people.
I love ur costco videos
Just found your videos and love that you’re doing the legwork for us in finding healthy options ...also loved the comedy bit with Art...keeping it real! ❤️
You are suggesting to buy spices in bulk. Don't bulk spices stay in market bins for over 6 months
Question: kirkland organic eggs in canada are marked as free range. Are they still not as good.
In your other video, you mentioned Suja was Bobby approved. I believe it was a newer video. Is this because of the ingredients being of higher quality? Thank you!
Costco needs to stay with chosen foods
A new egg substitute called "JUST EGG", WHATS YOUR TAKE ON THIS. LOOKED AT INGREDIENTS because I believe bad.
Aww darn no to the cooked bacon
I am looking for your video that talks about protein shakes. Specifically, Premier Protein Liquid Shakes. Where can I find that one?
Bobby whats the best I can order from the foodcourt at Costco?
Call them out bobby! Makes me feel good hopefully they can make real good food
Can you please do a video on the top staple items you buy on Thrive Market? Please!!!
Haa haaa i laughed out loud when art was eating pizza n hot dog...love your videos...im learning  😄😄😄
Do you have a video on protein bars,and shakes
Great video but that music is very annoying with the whistling over and over again. It was difficult to listen to you with that music.
Thanks for showing us the ins and out going to Costco.
Could not get past the background whistling. Just terrible
I new to channel... who guy with you? Business partner... he seems be with you more than wife about cooking an food... just curious
Also just curious, is there a difference between regular olive oil and extra virgin olive oil?
Will you go through that much cumin??  If you're Cuban you might..
I'm wondering, if something says Non GMO but not organic is that fine to have?
I wonder why I could not find some of  the items you mentioned  in Canada @ Costco
7:06 trust me if you're moroccan yes you're gonna go through that much cumin 😅👌
I still have the chosen foods avocado oil I live in NS,Canada.
Disagree on the pine seeds. People can have different reaction to different stuff. It could be different breed from whatever other countries produced, but they are legitimate great product.
This man is just a walking food fad, it's honestly amazing. Using cherry picked bits of information to make broad conclusions about human health and nutrition.
Good news, Costco's organic eggs are now pasture-raised!
Pre- pandemic! I miss this.
Nothing you say will get me to stop enjoying the delicious Costco rotisserie chicken!
Yikes! Thumbs down on that irritating whistle soundtrack.
That was adorable
What about the sea salt and black pepper from Costco? Are those okay?
Yeah, my mom would freeze Walnuts when I was growing up.
Don't buy anything from china
Great video very informative. But the music and whistling is driving me crazy...thanks man
ove your videos!
Thanks for your informative and fun to watch videos. I notice that your recommended almond flour is bleached. Does that make it less desirable?
Great info, enjoyed the video.
Don't know if you'll ever read this but seniors need those gummies. Some tablets and capsules are just way too big and hard for them to swallow. But yeah, would be good to lower their sugar content.
I only buy organic nuts and spices, chia, oatmeal etc.  and oils that are Organic  - and the oil in dark glass bottles not plastic.    My Costco store doesn't carry a lot of what you're talking about. I really like your energy and information on your videos, I always learn something new and useful.
yes i rather hear you Bobby than the music
Do you knew that all almond in USA is Gmo
Oil in plastic bottles
Love your shows ❤
I'm new to yours  channel  just subscribed  and 👍  San Francisco , California
LOL I buy Vital Farms Eggs only! And then you said you do too! ;)
Please, Create a Q&A link for question and then answer the questions on a video, because I have so many, to many to put on this video.
If, you've eaten unclean forever, how long do you think it takes the organs to recuperate and benefit from the cleaning eating once you start, eating clean?
I love these Costco videos! As an Alaskan where food costs are high and produce quality is lower these are soooo informative!
My Costco never has peanut butter 😭
🥱sgdvs

I get the Kraut dog everytime at Costco....the best....It goes great with health foods.
Love ur awesome healthy info.BUT PLEASE GET RID OF THAT ANNOYING WHISTLE MUSIC. YOUR INFO IS SOOOO IMPORTANT. JUST KNOCK OFF THAT MUSIC...PLEASE
,1111112222322211evv%:c.db u bug8bhhy4r
Thank you two you are saving my sanity by doing the research.
The end of the video was epic!  So awesome Art!  Way to bring it home, LOL.
love your show man i wish you had a patreon
Please no music it’s distracting. Sorry! Love all your videos. 🥰❤️
As cheap as balls, gotta love it! And Art is busy fullfling his chest day requirements.
I work at Costco and every time you touched a sign and made it crooked it made me cringe lol only because I make sure they’re straight when I put them up there
The chicken is cheap to lure customer. Their legitimately losing money.
Costco started selling kirkland organic pasture raised eggs. Are those any good compared to vital farms?
My granddaughter is 11 and has begun watching you. She ran to get our creamer to check label. Poison is in our food!!!! She says we need to take the time to read more labels. Thank you for helping educate her. Very interesting and fun to watch together.
I still buy Almond Butter at Trader Joe's as they have RAW Almond Butter. AFAIK, Costco only carries roasted (i.e. cooked) one
That Costco bacon has sodium nitrate as one of ingredients (thumbs down)
Hey Bobby just returned from Costco and picked up their almond oil. How is this for cooking?
I don't care how much good the double the price egg is, I'm not going to spend a cent more for eggs
Question!  Do you do the media request form ? and submit the "Costco Filming Agreement." ?     Individuals and businesses who wish to film, photograph, or broadcast at any Costco location must simply fill out a Media Request Form. ... If approved, we'll also ask that you submit a "Costco Filming Agreement."
dont buy organic eggs....BUY BUTTER AND BACON.
0:51  Costco: No preservatives Bobby: This chicken is pumped with preservatives. Costco: >_<
In south asian households that much cumin won't last more than 2 months max
Get rid of the whistle
I like this video but why are you telling us not to buy thing? people buy what they want
The Healthiest Pantry Foods see here  https://www.entirestrength.com/the-healthiest-pantry-foods/
And do a video on making your own butter.
Vitamin and supplements are essential for those with autoimmune and severe leaky gut. It greatly improves my life quality. 20% of USA population has autoimmune. Therefore, to say supplements are universally useless is bogus.
Have to say I would actually go through Costco sized of 5 spices I use in italian cooking like spaghetti. Lol.
Bobby: Explains why you shouldn't buy organic eggs to a random guy for 2 whole minutes. Random Guy: (Buys the organic eggs and leaves in front of bobby). Bobby be like: Really dude.   Awesome content though bobby. Cheers for the video.
GMO has no consistent definition from country to country. It is controversial, and even scientists cannot give a 100% sure answer whether it is good or not. How people can say it is definitely bad without any scientific evidence. Plus, genetic modifications happen all the time naturally too. Almost all the plant food we have now is GMO, because they are all so different from their ancestors.
Actually free-range eggs have a higher risk of being contaminated with increased levels of dioxins and DL-PCB than cage eggs. You keep talking that GMO is not toxic and bad for our health, please give us solid scientific evidence (experiments with control group, scientific articles...).
Costco is making America fat because is forcing people to buy in bulk and "eat in bulk" they need to reduce the sizes in half and charge only half (trader's joe or Sprouts are  better options & are helping America to get slim !)......&I only buy organic at Costco (e.g. only pasture raised/organic eggs & if i can trust they are really organic) not that i am rich but anything else is waste of money (most items in costco are waste of money anyway since quality has gone down lately).       & thanks to your bragging about low prices on some items, greedy Costco pumped up the prices by 30%. e.g. the almond butter is not $7.99 its over $12 now. the average worker at costco makes $25/hr. so we are paying for some other peoples' lifestyles.....you come out of this place and easily spend at least $100.
I miss Costco samples 😭 I agree on the kerrygold butter it is amazing!
Yeah Irvine on that box is sad I think they have him on their to sale and give him a cut since his face is on that package. I do wish once his contract is up he make a deal with another company that has something more healthier.
I

Littlefinger has a YouTube channel. Amazing.   *Subscribed*
Hi! What about the almond butter and flour, does it need to be organic?
1:35 That awkward handshake though 😅
Can you drow girl fucking girl
As we grew older, more likely to love this chanel. Great one actually! Keep going
Love this guys videos.  I dont know what it is but his vib is a very gentle love the way how he explains it keeps me entertained
This is his first haul video 😱😱
Bobby, Coconut milk is easy to make, just buy a real coconut steep in hot water and blend ....Art is the comic relief
Art chowing down in the Food court is vintage....good stuff.
LOL Costco pizza and hotdogs are a decadent treat! 🤣
Thank you for doing all this & being real at the same time.
When I am so convinced in buying healthy foods at start,, but at the end of the video when the guy eating pizza and hotdog with softdrinks...nahhh I think I changed my mind!
What do you think about using Avocado oil to deep fry?
The end was really funny I always follow your foods
Use unsaturated fat for dressings and dips. Unsaturated fats can be easily damaged and oxidized when heated, but are supremely healthy in their organic, extra virgin, cold-pressed form: Avocado oil Macadamia nut oil Olive oil Sesame oil Walnut oil
Use saturated fat for high heat cooking. These fats can tolerate higher heat temperatures without becoming oxidized. Buy organic, unrefined forms, from grass-fed sources if animal based, whenever possible: Coconut oil Palm oil Animal fat (from beef, lamb, chicken, or pork) Butter Ghee
we only have Sams Club,can you do them?
I like your channel I learn a lot about what to buy and what to avoid etc.
Notice that you didn’t mention buying organic nut butters.  I have heard that nuts easily take on pesticides.  Your thoughts please.
I found out  that  Bob and  Thomas are  diabetic ketoacidosis  people   who  fear  on what they use to eat  that's why  this channel is really made for   people  who's  got to  have  a certain  special kind of  food  and that's  keto  products . So  if you're not  in diabetic ketoacidosis  this channel is not for you.
My God Man!....you're a treasure chest of healthy food!.....subscribed to keep up-to-date on your knowledge.....and it's true....Canada food stores are way behind in quality!....So Sad.........
You say that PAM cooking spray for baking Is bad. I agree, but what would you recommend in its place???
Awesome help and funny, Art needs a little help there at the end, me too Very funny...lol
Luv the video but the whistling in the background is distracting!
lol funny guy, has common sense
Bullshit!   Avoid everything that this fool has to say!  If you believe this crap, you are gullible and deserve what you get.
I thought Quinua was a no no for paleo or keto. Is that correct?
Lol “ it makes me gassy and fart”
Ugh COSTCO PIZZAAAAAAA ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yes get rid of the whistling it's not good
Hilarious Art!   Ive heard Olive oil can go rancid so I hesitate to buy the big jugs.  How long does Olive oil last once its opened?
Making small talk at the the grocery store with strangers is sort of a habit for me.
Suja Organic Greens is an excellent organic beverage it isnt  "sugarwater"
BACKGROUND MUSIC.  CAN NOT WATCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pinenuts grow naturally in Nevada also. Picked them as a child with my Italian Grandparents.
I’ll take organic eggs at an amazing price vs “happy” eggs with no additional nutritional advantage for double if not triple the price.
Free range chickens run around eating out of cow patties. Chickens will eat anything. I prefer the caged ones with a controlled diet.
Not a fan of the loud background music.
I thought it was important to always buy oils in glass bottles so they are not exposed to light?
why do you need to slam someone for their age?
There prices are too high, I shop at Sam's Club and there member ship price is even cheaper. Looks like you are not buying too much.
Why is every item so expensive? He presents things like oil and eggs talking about value - then you see the price. $5.99 for 2 dozen eggs. At the time I could buy 15 eggs fo the dollar equivalant of 1.35. 1 liter (34 oz) of Mediterranean style oil for 2.60. Glad I don't live there!!
I buy 1 quality egg for cooking another for eating
And why does everyone have to have “mercy.”  Selling a t-shirt for $20 that worth $1 at the most is unconscionable.
Right on! on the supplements, what a waste. Like your videos a lot since i religiously shop at costco and have similar mentality towards good quality food even if its pricey and at the same time avoid the ones that just sells you sugar and heart attack.
The legit sᴜʙsᴄʀɪʙᴇʀ and ᴠɪᴇᴡ have truly only $2.54 1000 ᴠɪᴇᴡ and sᴜʙsᴄʀɪʙᴇʀ iz - *RAZORVIEWS.* *COM*
you've earned it Art!
My son has been working for Costco for years now. We live in MS and only have Sam’s Club. I wish they would get one here!
best part of this video..the great ending pizza and hotdog...real food😁😁😁
Are you making fun of old people?
Omg. Art how could you ????  My tummy is rumbling just watching you chow that garbage. Here I was thinking you guys are like total fanatics about healthy food. My heart is a little broken now but I’ll get over it. I really love the videos. Mad love and peace to the whole planet.  Xxoo.
What a lot of people have to realize including Bobby is that people buy according to how much money they have... You cant buy the best on a limited budget .....
I like the keto food diet but I also follow my blood type diet along with it!Being a type O. blood type Keto    goes well with me!
Just discovered your channel and I'm loving it!
I would not recommend buying flax seeds that have already been milled because flax seeds go rancid very quickly. Buy the seeds and use a spice grinder or re-purpose a coffee grinder to grind up the seeds as you need them.
I bought the almond flour and used my bag sealer put in 1/2 pound bags then put in the freezer.
Traitor
Love your videos but the whistling in the background is annoying! 👎🏻
I don’t think you’re in the position to tell people that they don’t need to be taking supplements. Even if someone has a healthy lifestyle, some instances call for extra supplementation. I think you are crossing the line there and you can’t be giving that type of advice on your show.
So,, how many kids are you and your wife feeding?. What's your budget for groceries every month?. When you do get there and have a big family  SOME shopping patterns and philosophies might change a little bit..lol
27 oz jar of Organic Creamy Almond Butter is now $11.89 in North Carolina
Hi Bobby, Can you go over some Worcestershire sauces please? thanks!!
I love  your videos but the whistling music makes me crazy.  Would prefer no music at all.  sorry
That background whistle is so annoying!!
website called spice house you can buy by the bag/oz and put into your own containers
hey! what's wrong with wholefoods organic bacon you cook in microwave? ai have a kiddo on the spectrum and if i can save time here and there I do. I cook 7 days a week for 2 different diets so I will keep my microwave bacon
Love the ending!
If he was a super hero his name would be "Mr. Whole foods"
I'm gonna  take this  video as comedy entertainment  cause  I kind of  laugh a little  when  he  insults a good  roast chicken   eliminate the  eggs   saying  all juices are  sugar water and  saying  more  fatty  bacon is better  peanut butter is terrible  and  to be  honest almond flour  is not  the best thing for cooking  alot of people  make more mistakes with  almond flour than regular flower  if you see how they try to make pizza out of it  and it looks fucked up all tho they  try to prove their points on You tube. And it's even more funny when  he's eliminating  vitamins and all the  oils  and  putting down the  protein bars  and than at the end  he  looks  stupid while his  friend is  eating a  normal lunch.
YOUR FULL OF SHIT ON YOUR PRIDUCT KNOWLEDGE  FOR THE MOST PART
dont mess with my precooked bacon but i throw it in the skillet a couple minutes tho.
i dont like the roasted chicken at costco got no flavor and raw
For the last F*ing time, hormones are illegal to use in poultry. Stop spreading misinformation.
I googled the Avocado Oil. “The oil is water extracted from the avocado fruit without the use of harmful chemicals and solvents, much the same way olive oil is made. We take it one step further and refine the oil to make it the perfect product that is suitable for all of your cooking needs. Marianne's Harvest Brands™ Avocado Oil is NON-GMO Project verified.”
I didn't know that nuts need to be in the fridge to preserve the oils and keep from getting rancid!  Good to know.
I can’t believe how many haters contradict your comments....I guess those people want to show they are super smart by putting down another.....maybe they need regularity or help ?
Well I  guess it's  ok for  these  keto assholes  to  make people believe that  everything your buy at the  supermarket is  bad for your health while his friend at the end is  chowing down  a slice of  pizza  and a hotdog.  And  he's got the nerve to say  shame on these people while the real  shame is  on them.
Seriously had to turn the video off....can't handle the whistling!!!
Agree with Joanne Mercier....whistling music makes me want to turn the video off!!! What's with that???
Let's see a blind taste test for organic eggs!
I tried Costco eggs at least twice and they always make me bloated and sick to my stomach I thought I was just becoming allergic to eggs now I see I’m just allergic to Costco eggs they are junk!
All right the rest of your picks sound good.  I pretty much agreed with you. I am a Costco fan
The skin does have seasonings on it and that can be taken care of by tearing the skin off don't eat the skin shouldn't anyway
In other words, it's their business philosophy—plain and simple. (The company has the same rule about keeping their concession hot dogs and soda at an inflation-ignoring $1.50.) Some were skeptical, though. According to Money, a more likely explanation is that the chicken is a "loss leader" that's meant to lure customers into the store later in the day—especially around dinner time. The hope is that these hungry customers will pick up a few other items they wouldn't have bought otherwise. As CNBC points out, that's why the rotisserie chicken counters are strategically located at the back of the store.
Coconut oil is crap as its super high in saturated fat. Problem with hemp hearts is that they mostly only contain omega 6. American diet is already rich in omega 6 and lacking in omega 3. Opt for ground flaxseed instead which has more omega 3 than 6.  You want your ratio of a omega 3 higher than your omega-6 in order to reap the benefits of a heart healthy diet
Not even lying, I go through that much cumin in 6 months. Maybe double. Hahaha it's my favourite spice
Nigga turn the background music off
I love your videos, BUT the background whistle "music" really is terribly repetitive and irritating!
Never heard of the pine nut syndrome before - good info on that. Is there a better choice at Costco on eggs?
Best part: The PIZZA eating!!  I am an avid pizza fan. Cheese pizza for me though.  :)
3:12 love how he told us not to buy it and then 5 seconds later he’s passing em out to people 😂😂😂
The whistling sound was... well I could listen all the way thru! Bummer I love your videos...
Please please please don’t play that music or at least lower it!!! It’s almost to much..😩
from china---no thanks.  soft plastic, avoid, esp w liquids like oils.
Your a dumb fuck
Thanks...but your background music (on repeat...) was really annoying lol!
I’m new to your show and I love it! Thank you.
ART! You so crack me up 🤣😭🤣
Some of us can’t even afford the organic ones at all
Shame on you.  Costco chicken is the best.
New Mexico.has pine nuts, they sell on the side of the road. Expensive stuff. I don't know about Cosco. Great buys, but the size of containers for singles. As a side, Art, OMG! :D
Is it wrong that I will absolutely go through that much cumin in 6 mo... if my Costco had that I’d be all over it
I liked your videos!
I buy pirate booty for my kids class snack! The kids love eating it and the name.
Food court has to update
What's the annoying whistling in the background from?
Art is keeping it real,  I  can't leave without my hot dog either.
The only aisle in Costco with no people in it.
I love this! I am going to share this video with my FACS  (Family and Consumer Sciences) classes!  I will also be checking out your recipes- thanks for sharing.
I’ve ALMOST forgiven you for the “middle aged” person at the Costco entry comment. (Coming from a middle aged woman, 53). Thanks for your videos. I have learned so much!
The avocado oil is water extracted, non gmo and refined.
You owe us an apology for that GD whistling! What maroon would think that's a good idea! TV production 101 ... don't distract with background.
which location costco is this?
I learned years ago that spices will deteriorate in heat.  Parsley, dill and other green spices will turn brown and then are totally useless.  I got tired of having to run to the store every time I needed a spice ingredient so I started storing my spices on the door in my refrigerator freezer.    The advantages are (1) you can see what you have, (2) nothing ever goes bad, and (3) spices kept in the freezer are twice as potent so you only need HALF of what the recipe calls for.  Yes, it works every time.  And when spring rolls around I buy fresh dill, parsley, scallions, rosemary, etc. dry them, roll them between wax paper with a rolling pin, put them in glass or plastic jars in the freezer and save a ton of money on really inexpensive spices that are overpriced in the grocery store.  And you never have to run out.  What could be more convenient and frugal?
Irvine is a sell out look at those ingedients, it reads more like a candy bar
seems everything so called good for you has too be the more expensive stuff
Way to go Art... scoff that pizza! Hahaa
God bless you... I ALWAYS buy the VITAL Farms Pasture Eggs now.  Happy chickens Happy life!
Jessica @jambeauty89 I think that’s her, recommended you to her audience, this is my 4 th video and one you said “cheep as balls” you had me as a fellow person who uses balls in their daily language.
The whistling is totally annoying!!  Great content, cut the whistler.
What about the absorption rate on the vitamins.  Are they govt government approved?  A Co. named melaleuca has vitamins that were tested by Feinberg institute.  You get good value for money.
I know you've got a great diet but have you had your B12 checked?
New sub..👍
Mexicans use cumin everyday! Lol we could definitely use that in 3 months.
Your comment about getting by the middle aged person was unnecessary !
Art! yrr killing me 🤣
I am at Costco all the time because I love them been a member for over twenty years, but I must say I agree that European butter is better, but I have been to Ireland and France and I prefer French butter.  Never buy eggs in plastic or styrofoam cartons only buy the ones in cardboard cartons, they stay fresh much longer that way.  Buy the Himalayan Pink salt and the Black Peppercorns, keep in a dark, cool, dry place, they will keep, i only buy small amounts of dried spices at the grocery store.  Costco has really awesome meats, but if you live in a Condo like I do not even freezer space, for any big party though or special occasion, I will definitely buy my meats there.    Obviously, you are obsessed with your food obsessions, but definitely the place to buy bedding and towels and half of my clothes were purchased there, great quality and pricing and I still own clothes I bought there 15 years ago and have been washed many times and they still hold up even if I don't wear my old favs much any more, hey styles have changed.
Love Art.... Go Pizza 🤣
Please kill the music
Thank you soooo much... I'm learning a lot from you to take care of my health.👍 God bless you.🙏
Great video!!
My friend Frances is in your video.
Everthing is packaged in plastic. So you're saving money at the expense of the environment. Leave that bill to your children and grandchildren, right? Smh.
Pine nut syndrome????  China?????
what are the GOOD juices? As in cranberry juice.. is there any GOOD cranberry juice?
I have to disagree with him on the gummy vitamins and gummy calcium. Some adults are unable to chew or swallow traditional pills. The gummies provide an ease of use for those people. Also due to the medications that some people take, they have to fortify with specific vitamins.
I am very surprised you missed a critical isle where all the items doesn't have any ingredient  labels....Veggies and fruits isle?
Hi- yes please go through the meat dept. at Trader Joe's.
I just love your videos. My daughter got me started, I'm one of your aka middle aged people.
Watching this video makes me want to chop down a tree and eat a spotted owl.
Love your show. Thank you for helping us buy the right foods.
The random encounters are so awkward i love the cringe.
Uncle Farturo and Bobby classic.
The first haul video with Art. Legendary! Where it all started.
OMG.... those prices!!! How do you even live!? In Europe: Penut butter 16oz 2.20€. Free Range Eggs 24 eggs 1.40€. Coconut oil 13oz 3.00€. Extra virgin Olive oil 169oz 6€. Almond butter 16oz 3€. Coconut flour 3pound 3.99€. Unsmoked bacon 0.80pound 1.20€. Pecan nuts 3pound 2.99€. Coconut milk 13oz 0.89€. This is an example...... and in talking about Keto friendly, high quality foods here. I don’t know how you can get through the month.
I busted a gut with Art chowing down on the hot dog and pizza. Great video on Costco stuff. 👍🏻 Please lose the background jiggle.
Love Art! 😆🍕🌭🍕🌭🍕🌭🍕😁
love it!! thank you so much!
Guy at the end scares me every time. Lol why is he there??
Don't like the whistling music..you really don't need background music in your videos..
I tried watching until the end, but I just couldn’t. That whistling music was giving me anxiety. 😂 I still love your videos man. 😃
The Kirkland organic peanut butter is like chalk
Oh my goodness!!! Art had me laughing so much at the end!!! He is me!!! Haha I go to costco and buy the organic and bobby approved buttttt I always have the pizza with coke!!! In my mind I balance it out!
This is totes adorbs seeing Bobby in street clothes with his hair not slicked back -- surprised to see this was just a year ago.  I love these videos -- Bobby is my official youtube food guru.  Thanks Bobby, Dessi & Art : )
I miss Cosco since I moved to FL from NY. Can you do a Sams?
Wonderful store but they drive too fast in the parking lot. Smaller stores are more convenient such as Aldi.
One year ago today
im all for this guy but it feel like a little bit of my way any other way is wrong like its fine if you want to eat 10 dolar drink who gives a shit. do i want to know my shit sure but im not gonna do this religiously
Falfurrias butter
Ur definitely not a spokesperson for Costco. U speak for the ppl. Thank you..😄
If you ever see first fruit name. Buy there fruit. Apples in season now and on stores. Totally organic they do not allow any spraying around the orchards.
The whistle music is horrible. As much as I love your video, I can’t listen any more!
Why don’t they have any organic products?
tip... kerry gold cows are grain finished... you may want to stop promoting it!
One slice of that Costco pizza is a ridiculous amount of calories.
Please speak more about Paleo!😀 Thanks for the videos.
Art: * It's NOT what it looks like* HAAHAAA
stupid whistling sounds...distracting
Art is against everything you've preached for the last 15 mins lol
I totally agree that Vitale farms eggs taste the best, and that’s what I buy.  However, they are very expensive.  I’m the only one in my family who eats eggs so it’s doable for me.  But I’m guessing a lot of the people buying eggs in bulk have much larger families who all eat eggs.  Sometimes, the budget just doesn’t allow a family to buy the absolute best.  If budget didn’t matter, everyone could buy the best of all foods.  It’s just not practical for everyone.
I'm on the Mediterranean diet. Kirkland olive oil is rated super well. I buy my eggs off of a farmer for $2.50/dozen. I buy my quinoa there as well. I make my kombucha at home. I have that peanut butter. It's not a big part of my diet. I buy my Kirkland's Greek yogurt there, as well. You use a lot of herbs and spices with the Mediterranean diet. I doubt I would use that much cumin. Most spices are old when they hit the shelf. I have soft teeth so I have to take Vitamin D.
You guys are funny and real!!!
I know you talk about gut flora a lot, can you make a video about the topic?
I STOPPED AFTER 2 MINUTES DUE TO THE UNNECESSARY WHISTLING. GET RID OF IT. IT'S VERY ANNOYING!!!!!
I’ve had spices in my pantry for like a year that literally tastes the same as day one. Common man, let’s not exaggerate.
Most awkward laugh and handshake 1:36 lol
I would love a coffee alternative video!
does eating non human food like seeds cause you say bomb all the time?  How many times per hour are  you pooping
The World Health Organization says processed pork products like bacon is carcinogenic. No thank you!
Can you use coconut milk as a creamer?
Does anyone know of an equivalent channel to this but for Spanish speakers?
TLDW:  1. don't buy rotisserie chicken, buy chicken thighs, roast at home, see recipe at flavcity.com 2. kerrygold unsalted butter is better 3. costco organic eggs not so good, buy Vital Farms from Whole Foods 4. avoid pom or suja organic juices, acai...  5. buy thick cut bacon (with green/black label) 6. buy almond and peanut butter from costco 7. buy almond flour and see recipes at flavcity.com (biscotti, crackers, etc.) 8. dont buy bulk spices from costco, buy just enough 9. buy coconut oil 10. avoid canola and veggie oil, buy olive oil and EVOO, buy avocado oil (look for cold-pressed, Extra virgin, Chosen Foods is a good brand) 11. buy bulk nuts and store in fridge or freezer (avoid pine nuts made in china, dont buy the Costco organic pine nuts) 12. buy hemp hearts brand (hemp seeds) or any brand of flax, chia seeds, quinoa,
I started buying  VITAL Farm eggs a while back...glad to hear my "gut" was right.
I love your videos however please check your privilege. "Eat good ,work out. that's all you have to do. "Please realize that not everybody have your privilege or this luxury.
Cheap as ballz
Almond flour is high in omega 6,  I  though it was bad for you?
You lost me at "If you're on Keto... you better be...buy European style butter." Don't tell people what diets they should be on or not, patronizing and/or condescending down to your viewers is not a good look.
I like to use olive oil on my hair
Where. Do you get your lundary detergent from
You're still a Kerrygold fan despite them currently being sued for not being grassfed? Bummer...
What does hipster aisle mean?
Fun and Interesting perspectives but for one thing, do your cooking with coconut oil period.  Never ever mess with canola oil, and as for olive oil, buy the good stuff in the glass bottle and use it for salads not cooking because monounsaturated is more delicate.
Please look for meal supplements drinks that are bobby approved! Also what protein powders are the best? Love your show! 😊 Thank you!
I can't beleive that's not the top comment.
Seriously guys!  No-One saw that incredible hand hug!   1:27
I just Love you guys 👊 🤪 ✌️👏👌 So much information Amen 🙏 😇 👊
Thanks for all your information,  Almighty God bless you and your family!
At my Costco,  the price for the almond flour is 12.99 , Brandon, fl
Have you done a review on the Costco pasture raised eggs?
You're not paying for a lot of fat with the precooked bacon.
Hi Bobby can you do more Costco videos and an ice cream review!
Thank you!!
Thank you!!
Spices last longer than 6 months in Tuppwerware!! Try it!
Thank you sir!
Love these videos, Thank You
What about peanut oil?
Love these grocery store hauls! Can you please do one on the baby food solids section? (Plum Organics/Earth's Best, etc) Or something that can help those of us with 6-18 month babies? Thanks!!
Bobby’s voice just changed when he got off script at 3:24, gangsta
OMG! Pine nuts are my favorite at Costco!   I need to look for pine nuts from Italy now😀
You should do a Sam's haul.
Hi Bobby, can you please add something regarding if is ok to cook with pork lard? I know that is one white and another brown... Please can you let us know if is ok to use it....Than you
You remind me of the guy from Westworld lol
11:46 omega 6 increase inflammation, flax increase extrogen in men along with boobs and ED.
You can use olive oil for frying and EXTRA virgin olive oil for cooking. Dahhh
Peanut butter increases inflammation in the body. Stay away from it.. go Almond butter ❤
the pizza hotdog combo at the end had me laughing so hard 😂😂
Thank you so much  for the information, Costco will be opening in Perth 2020. Looking forward to it.
The 2 pack olive oil Costco has is refined. How bad are refined oil for us? Appreciate your videos.. big thumbs up..
Happy eggs??? Seriously?
amazing video
Pantry items are items that Don't need refrigerators.
Art rocks. More Art please!
Great information
Lol I love Art
My doctor prescribed vitamin d for me and I buy that at costco because as you age your bones need more vitamin d.  You're young and as you age some vitamins are prescribed.
Well HA!! I went into Costdo and got a membership, and told them it was BECAUSE OF YOU AND ART. This is funny --- while processing, one of the ladies pulled up one of your you tubes and was watching it.  Your videos are the reason I got a membership.  They should recognize you are a draw.   Love your You tubes, but I want you to remember you are cooking for two --- OK three with Art.  If you are cooking for six kids, a husband, and left overs for healthy lunches to take to work,  you must think much larger.  Won't go into my past with all the foster kids and adopted kids we have had --- and they seem to still hang around, but you cook SMALL!!! Maybe you should do a feed the army size family with good food You tube.  I loved your show on EBT.  I am a food fanatic, and with in reason, and it can be done. I will tell you that when you cook healthier, they eat more, and rarely get sick.  Art can come to my house any time!!! I make our own whole grain bread!! And pizza Art!!! As I said, love your videos.  Bought the cookbook --- you guys rock!!! SMOOCH!!!
also best, clean kept groceries
yes best things to get at trader joes and winco please do a video on that
Why talking only about keto should be more general
I'm glad he called out the snake oil supplement industry
What about omega 3 eggs, are they better or is it b.s?
I don't have a Costco store near me, the closest one to me in 1 1/2 hrs. away. Would you be able to do a grocery haul at BJ's ?
Yes, the background "noise " is unnecessary, maybe a gentle, meditative tune instead, please!
Ahhh, did my Costco haul today and soo kept thinking, is this Bobby Approved??? I almost got the rotisserie chicken and my brain screamed NOOOOO!  I have a sensitivity to corn related and gmo doctored foods. It causes me to seize.  So, i got my avocado oil mayo you said ok to and when did hellmans go soybean oil first?  I didn't find the healthy cocunut creamer for coffee, but Jewel has creamer from Califia Farms called Betterhalf coconut cream and almondmilk with vanilla and no sugar!  Its in the cooler with the diary products and really good.
Great info. For those who are crying over what he thinks....shut up already he can have his opinion is his channel, his life you are choosing to watch. This is good information not perfect but not bad
I take Kirkland fish oil, vitamin C, and Clacium from COSTCO every day...I hope it's OK.
Arturo knows how to live!! lmao great informative video!
I’m gonna die anyways.... but anyways good bye
Just have to say thank you for the info about the organic eggs. When I picked up the package, I could literally feel the energy of the chickens pain, for making those eggs and had to put the package down, before I started crying in the store. And, confirming that I felt correctly! :)
I agree about the pine nuts It happened to me too. My taste was bitter for a whole week. I'm from Santa fe NM. My family came from the colonizers here. We were Jews fleeing the Inquisition we brought with us from Spain and Portugal Pinon trees. Some of the best pine nuts are from the  Northern part of NM. We used to pick them as children. We call them Pinon. You would love Santa fe NM. We have the best sun sets
Oy, the smugness! It burns!
We buy fully cooked Kirkland Bacon all the time. So if it's so 'wrong' elaborate. Just saying it tells me nothing. I'm listening . . .
I would like to see videos regarding drinking water;  Distilled, spring or IONIZER water
Great info but please lose the whistling music or whatever that is in the background.  It’s highly annoying.
No poultry has added hormones. https://meatscience.org/TheMeatWeEat/topics/meat-labels/article/2017/06/08/misleading-claims-of-hormone-free-or-antibiotic-free
I learn alot from your videos. Thank you. You are fabulous 👍
You are buying artificial junks at all.
My BS meter is screeching in response to this guy.
Are we aware that not all chemicals in ingredients are bad?
Agree with some comments, but a plant based diet is the most healthy. Bacon??? Eggs?? Coconut oil...not so much. https://nutritionfacts.org/introduction/  Check out some statistics...for real health.
why the whistling?
love it
Costco Chickens are delicious and a great value for a fast moving family.  This guy is an Omega male.
You are hilarious😂😂...subscribed !
But butter yess I to eat mine
I love your buddy there. He makes me feel less guilty when I decide to eat the super unhealthy stuff  after shop the healthy food.
I store my ground spices in the fridge, and dispense little at a time in a smaller container and keep it in my shelf, It stays fresh for more than a year
Hard to believe he is as educated as he makes it out to be when he says "Eat GOOD, workout and ignore these bull-crap supplements." He also says "in my opinion" alot. The idea of the video would be great if I had some more legitimate sources of information.
I’ve been a Costco member forever but will not be renewing my membership. Reason is the portion sizes of most purchases are so HUGE that I can never use them up. Being a single person, I have no one to share the purchases with. Spending $60 a year for membership makes no sense. Wish they’d sell things in smaller packages.
I’m going today, wish me luck 😆 so much crap to weed out !!
Lol I love the vitamins Isle . Waste of money , crap ! So true . People just think it’s easier then eating healthy and exercise so they buy a gummy to think that they are being healthy. 😂 this world is so silly ! So much shit on shelves. It’s nuts . Be smart and do your research!!! Buy nothing from China . 😑 not healthy
Can't believe people buy this dudes crap.
This is cringy to watch. The guy isn't very educated on most of what he claims to be educated on. 🙃😑   Why is this in my recommendations?
The original Land o Lakes butter is the best and then the one with Olive oil.
I’m surprised Costco didn’t kick you out right away. They don’t allow filming, especially negative filming.
Nice! You buy products with plastic containers😖😳😱😡Don’t buy anything with plastic and paper packaging  Huge pollution problem
Check out farmersbox.com/healthfood for real chickens and beefs products. You can get them delivered directly to your  doorstep as well as making a profit out from them !
You tell me to stay away from the sugar water juice and kombucha but advocate for the thick-sliced bacon...🤔
But seriously, hot dog, big slice of pizza, and free refill soda -- all for $3.49 is ridiculous value.  That is a filling (albeit not so healthy) lunch.
Me:  I see your point about these organic eggs.  I would want happy chickens too. Him:  I buy organic eggs from Whole Foods, which are literally twice the price, but... Me:  Nevermind.  Pass me them eggs, man.
Thank you so much for this information
when he commented on the possible hormones in Costco's roasted chicken I felt he really doesn't know what he's talking about.  Adding hormones to the diet of chickens has been banned since the 50's.....and his negative comment about not buying cooked bacon made no sense.  It's a personal choice, I may want a small amount of bacon for a recipe but the why go to the trouble of cooking bacon when I need one slice.  I really enjoy these types of videos but one needs to really know their facts, there's enough myths out there to puzzle up the best of us and the chicken hormone thing is something this guy should know.  And if he doesn't like buying cooked bacon then I think he needs to give a reason not just an opinion, otherwise he sounds like a snob not an expert.
Funny ending!
I’m sorry but I hate thick cut bacon!
Few good tips but mostly useless
Ummm is this a joke? I mean he said avoid the chicken because of the preservatives when it literally says there are none....
What about the organic frozen selection of broccoli, rice cauliflower and berries? BEST deal ever. Don't want to take from the local farmers, but there is nothing better than vine ripened from the farm, 2nd best is frozen.
Love your videos!
😂 You’re going to get kicked out of Costco if you’re telling customers there not to buy their eggs hahahahaha
Kerrygold has unsalted. You said in another video to use ORGANIC almond items because of pesticides, but you just got the non organic almond flour.
Hi join your channel consider me to win your giveaways
Costco. Near me has organic Pasteur raised  eggs....so glad
Your videos are really informative and entertaining. I would just note that flax is a powerful *estrogen precursor*. You may want to look into this for yourself. I avoid flax for the same reason I avoid soy! While flax is not as likely to be GMO as soy, the hormone disrupting factor is still there. That should give anyone pause, especially for a guy, though. Just a thought.
agree...👍🏻 video               👎 whistling music
I just watched 2 of your videos and I love them! Really educational!
Just stumbled onto this man, does he eat fruits?
Do u have a Trader Joe’s food haul video?
Welcome to Costco, I love you.
7:03 yes my family goes through spices that fast because unlike you we ethnic people know how to season our food
Tells people that Kirkland doesn't have the best organic eggs, but then agrees to help the couple out by lifting two dozen eggs and putting it into their carts. Then he goes on to say that Kombucha makes him gassy and fart. Sometimes Bobby makes me LOL so hard. I still watch all the videos to the end hahaha. I love this channel.
U should do a video don’t for Sam’s club
Question! On supplements and keto. I HATE taking vitamins and they make me feel crummy after taking them, after I eat. But I keep hearing that because Of the extra fat I’m eating, I need certain supplements like gall bladder formula to help process it. Is that true?
I love your show but the whistling music is very anoying
Wreally!?  Toilet tissues are very popular item in cart!??  I usually observed customers.  Big ticket items should be the biggest discount amount to recoup fee, right away; like Apple computa
what he says makes a lot of sense ! unbiased reviews
Thank you, eye-opening..
Hi would it be possible to do a video on buying foods for diabetics thankyou
Do you know how those pigs are raised from that particular bacon?
Robert Irvine is the classic example of "fit" but not "healthy" ....as most gymrats are. Sadly.
Background music sucks.
No need to bullshit. You have skills why spend time with politics or things you have idea about!
Microwave bacon has lots less fat than regular bacon. I have heart disease and how to have lower far diet.
Thanks for sharing bro for healthy
Can you  video on Kombucha
Not everyone shops costco. But thanks for the info
Trader Joe’s, is owned by Aldi’s
Hey, Let me have my gummies! You are no fun at all!
even if chickens have happy lives that doesn’t mean that they want their eggs to be eaten and the majority of “cage free” eggs aren’t even actually raised in a pasture, it’s just a big open factory floor with chickens stuffed in there.
Very helpful!
Sam’s club has the best deals for cold press organic avocado oil !!! 32 oz for $7.95!!!
To address your point about Costco rotisserie chicken.. "no whole cooked chicken should be priced at 4.99.." Costco actually sells these at a loss, about $40 million per year. They do this for the "wow" factor and a way to get you in the door. Every Costco is layer out differently but often times the rotisserie chickens are placed at the end of the main isle, attracting customers to go in that direction, walking past all the great products they're trying to promote. I don't work for Costco, I'm just a dedicated customer of theirs and after knowing this, I can't help but share haha
Pretty good video. I agree with much of what he says. We Love all the organic stuff at our Costco. I love Kerry Gold butter but it is expensive at 5.00+ per pound. I like to eat slices of it like cheese sometimes. For cooking/baking I like their European style butter. 4 pounds for 12.49.
I use extra virgin olive oil and avocado oil in cooking and I air fry everything now
I just bought Chosen Foods Avocado Oil at Costco in Eugene Oregon.....seems I got lucky!!!
Middle aged man or woman? Really? C’mon!!!!
Totally gonna keep buying the Costco chicken #sorrynotsorry
I wish these types of videos would have been around when I was younger, would have saved me some health troubles I experience now
It is "cheap as balls"! Love it dude, great show
If hormones are not added to chickens since the 70s, why do you mention it as a reason to avoid the rotisserie chicken?
All grocery stores:  This guy: I’m about to end this man career.
1:35 that handshake. Do people really listen to this guy
Good tips, sound like a douchebag tho😂
this is the most pretentious asshole video i have seen. Eggs are eggs, unless you are an athlete that needs their body to be absolutely finely tuned so that no tear sprain or weakening can occur, just eat fucking eggs. eggs are eggs, you fail to mention that the chickens natural foods are veggies as equally well as bugs, bugs make chickens carnivores. to restrict a chicken from eating one of its natural prey is harming the chicken. how can you be so cruel to the chicken? you restrict its diet is like restricting its personal space, so cruel
you can also deep fry in coconut or avocado oil. i have never done and don't about the temps, but Ihave known it to be done
Great video!! More please. God bless
I don’t have a Costco card but Sam’s, trying to see if any brands that you suggest are sold at Sam’s.
WTF is wrong with your brain? You put all that horrible repetitive whistling in the background of your video and make it so irritating while trying to listen to you.   I kept wondering over and over what the hell is that whistling. I thought it was some idiot whistling in the store. Finally I realized you were the idiot who put it in there.  Noise is the ultimate inhibitor in communication. It's functions in every social setting. Time for you to wake up and take a class in behavioral studies!
Dag everything is bad for us what can we eat I guess the best thing to do is read the ingredients on everything I do think a lot of the foods we eat are poisonous
Can you do a video on acceptable bottled drinks and summer drink. Thx, your videos are very informative
I’m at Costco evvvvvery two weeks to shop! I wish they sold Barney’s Almond Butter because it’s the absolute best tasting Almond Butter ever to me!
U are the guy that some people see and immediately want to get kicked out of the store because you are a know it all. It gets annoying honestly how u approach things with people.
I always buy Kirkland peanut butter and almond butter at Costco I love them
He would bug the hell out of me if he told me that about the eggs in the store. I buy what I want dude 🙄
100% Kerry Gold îs  The Best!!!! And love the salted butter better!
Thanks for the review, but to each, their own. One man's treasures, are another's items to avoid. I hate butter and bacon both which are loaded with fat. Love Costco's BBQ chicken @ $7.99 Cdn., can't beat the price, since Costco sells 3 uncooked ones for $25. I buy 2 1/2 doz. extra large white omega-3 eggs for under $6 Cdn.
Bobby, please kill the whistling music.  It is so annoying it overrides your wonderful message.  Thank you for the good information.
Love vital farm eggs
I’ve always wanted to do this, but my Costco is crawling with Mexican kids! Like six per family; all screaming. Went to an Oregon Costco recently...not so much. 🤔
Art is Awesome!
You should do ten healthy items to buy at the China mart.
bad music
over priced brown eggs.
Do you recommend how I should blend the Thai coconut milk together since it separates. Thank you.
Coconut oil is bad pure saturated fat
I like your videos, have you done Earthfare or Whole Foods haul’s? I would like to see those.
Thanks we love onions
thats the most awkward hand shake
We have hemp hearts at Costco in Independence MO so I assume they have them everywhere.
Dude canola is extracted from rape seed which is poisonous...  check it out.  :-)
I deep fry with pure lard.
Enjoy your information but that whistling sound is soooooo annoying.
I have celiac disease and live in Canada where we don't get enough Vitamin D because of the lack of sunlight. I have to take vitamin B (Costco B Complex works really well for me) and their Vitamin D is the best price. I have to take both of these along with Calcuim because of my celiac disease as my body does not absorb these vitamins well plus I cannot eat wheat products so I do not get enough Vitamin B.  I also have a dairy intolerance.  So Costco's supplement aisle is a must for me. My doctor monitors my levels to help me maintain good health. I know we can get most vitamins from our food supply but some of us need a little extra help so I wouldn't discount or avoid the supplement aisle as in some cases it is a must to assist some of us in maintaining our health.
This guy is an idiot. Just watched a video of his on chicken and he says how it is illegal to add hormones to chicken, then tells you not to buy the rotisserie chicken because of added hormones?
A small jar of organic almond butter at Wal-Mart is $16.00
(Not sponsored.) Those Suja juices are truly just veggies + fruits–no sugar added. They're also cold-pressed so they can last a long time in the fridge and aren't rip-offs like the ones you'd buy locally w/fewer ingredients from a juicer but for 4-5x the price. That's cool that Costco carries them as well.
im glad you told us about the organic eggs: chickens being kept as "battery hens" where each chicken has to stand or sit in a cage that is only one inch wider and longer then their body.  buy free range eggs.  the pomegranate juice says 100% pomegranate so i don't see that that is "sugar and water". it is interesting to search if being pasteurized would ruin the flavonoids and antioxidants....? , if so then yes its a waste of money.... i'll have to look into it!   sorry to give a different take on the bacon.... (we canadians always have to apologise! lol)  the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified any preserved meats (bacon, sausage, salami, ham, all highly processed meat in the deli department ) that have nitrates /nitrates, as a definite carcinogen encouraging colon cancer. Those "cured" meats now are on the  same warning/classification as smoking.... !!!  Unfortunately the "natural cured" with celery extract" still has the same cancer-causing,  chemical effect as routine nitrates and nitrites, (according to the "Time" magazine article on this a couple years ago...) so it doesn't avoid making the meat being a carcinogen. i was fooled by that for years...   Many processed types of meat that look "healthy" like turkey sliced have nitrates and nitrites.... all that meat that gets sliced for you at the deli section....   i have had breast cancer and had earlier done keto, for a few years.... I had bacon frequently, those turkey mini pepperonis, and a lot of meat, dairy, .. .  i think in retrospect the keto diet spurred on my cancer... i have since read good studies where certain animal proteins and fats feed cancer and promote hormone excess (www.nuturitionfacts.org)     keto may be ok for young people (high meat/high animal fat/ keto) but please research other sites that focus on curing cancer through complementary medicine and diet... (eg www.chrisbeatcancer.com and www.nuturitionfacts.org) especially if you are older or prone to cancer. www.nutritionfacts.org focuses on assessing old but relevant research with new gold standard research...  According to W.H.O......people need to avoid  (special occasions only? ?) preserved meat with nitrates... especially as colon cancer often isn't found till late.... Time Magazine had an article on this .. maybe a couple years ago now...   Was great to see what was useful to buy at Costco otherwise, and also alert people to the chemical soup of the roast chickens,  they are so darned tasty but so is all meat with sugar, flavorings, preservatives... they just LOOK natural after being roasted...   Thank you for alerting people to the caged hen situations of the organic eggs. it's more about the really cruel way of keeping the chickens. imagine your whole life in a wire mesh cage with only 2 inches ALL  around your body.... can't EVER  turn around.... Shame on Costco for not selling free range organic ... there's lots around... it seems more "expensive' but it's only what? about 3.00? more to buy organic AND free range.... its still really very little as a food source.  At least consider choosing  the free-RANGE and farms that are certified by the SPCA ....  (free "run" is more vague.... . ) ... better to eat fewer eggs anyway... see www.nuturitionfacts.org about eggs too!   thanks for your care and generous sharing of your time... love your humor too!!. Sue
Aldi next please!!!
You gotta love Art lol!!!
I didnt know that chicken has all those preservatives thanks guys!!!
Are you guys here in Chicago???
Hormone growth is illegal in the United States. Don't let the hormone free label fool you, they can't use it anyways.
My co-worker has hens and I get my eggs from her super super cheap. Those are the happiest, most well fed hens and they lay the most beautiful eggs with a deep orange yolk. Yum!
Art looks like a 42 year old. Dude monitor what goes in your mouth! Train wreck waiting to happen
Part of your claims are full of Crap!
There should be ingredient in chickens mmm
I like to use coconut milk in my coffee but when I drink it then eat something it keeps me in the ladies room don*t wanna use half &half any more milk & cheese keeps my nose full of mucus so im trying slowly to eat clean I bought the milk form dollar tree I notice it has sodium in it wonder why I stayed bloated I saw some in trader Joes  it was about 2.39 a can not including tax .I looked in Sams club they don't carry any coconut milk
my nutrition class professor told us if you have coconut oil at home through it away immediately!
Your “Middle Aged” comment was pathetic and uncalled for.
I don't know where I heard that chia seeds cause inflammation but I've stopped incorporating them in my diet
thx for suggesting buying chicken thighs rather than roasters, than living like king's meal also trader joes!
What substitute sugars should a diabetic person use that is also good for you and good for your body
What ketchup are sugar free or no sugar added.
Authentic pignoli nuts  from Italy are  so delicious; the ones from China, HELL NO !!!!!
Bobby, how about BJ's !   That is where we go as it is more convenient  and it isn't too bad !  Plus, the size of items isn't quite as large as Costco and it is a smaller store;  that's good !
Wow that black girl at 1:25 is so pretty
Please re-do this video without the sounds in the background. It sounds like a train.
Was a bit skeptical on your review of costco eggs, so looked up the cornucopia site, https://www.cornucopia.org/scorecard/eggs/kirkland-signature/ . The site seems to have no data on kirkland eggs. Due to this, they gave kirkland a 0 rating on all categories. This doesn't mean that costco eggs are bad or good. It's just that they don't have info on costco eggs.
LOL ART IS SO CUTE
Ugh....I had to turn this off due to the annoying "sound track" of whistling.  SO annoying I couldn't concentrate on what the dude was saying.  Why do people do that? it negates all of their hard work on the video they're sharing.
Thanks for this great video! So helpful 😊 I could do without the background music though... Or maybe turn it down?
Every video be like yo dawg, make it home ITS SO EASY.....unless you work more than 20 hours a week then you aint got time to do that cause the rent is too damn high.
Yes I will use all the cumin in 6 months Lol.
I like the bad for you bacon tho
Bobby's assessment of the vitamin and supplement aisle (with the exception of what he says about sugar added gummy crap) is judgmental, ignorant, and just plain wrong.  It's not as simple as "eat right and exercise" for everyone.  It feels like only yesterday I was doing extreme sports and eating super healthy vegetarian food.   After suffering from inexplicable fevers for years I finally find out I have Lyme Disease, and it's spread everywhere, causing body-wide damage and inflammation.   All of a sudden I have vitamin D, B, and magnesium deficiencies.  And thank god for Turmeric/Curcumin capsules (also in that aisle)... without it, I'd have to take pharma crap to control pain.  Be grateful for your health, Bobby, not judgmental of others.
I wanna try that uncured turkey bacon. I might join Costco because BJ’s don’t have it.
I agree with avoiding rotisserie chicken. And besides, it’s always dry when you reheat it. If you have an air fryer, you can make the best rotisserie chicken ever in 1 hour flat.
Background music is annoying.
I have good hearing but this guy I cannot hear  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
awesome people!
Do you have a sams grocery haul?
Bitch not all adults can swallow regular pill..... that’s why they use the adult gummy. Don’t be naive
Am I the only one who was secretly pleased when people ignored his holier-than-thou put downs of the Costco eggs?  To be honest, I don't buy the eggs from Costco, and the price on those were ridiculous, but people who do what he did here drive me insane.
My organic eggs from Costco says "Cage Free" on it.  Are they lying?
At 7:13 he said u cant go through that much in 6 months me : not if your mom cooks paskitian food almost everyday ps. She spices everything with cumin
In my costco they have silver kerry butter
I love shopping  at Costco.
Agree with your statement that 99% of sold supplements (mnieral, vitamin) are a waste of $, not needed. However, IF there is a scientifically documented thru frequently repeated labs)deficiency, not remedied thru nutritional intake, as in my case with vit D3 (was as low as 11!), yes, it can* be partof your health regimen.
Cashews are cheaper at Aldi!
I like the organic young whole chicken and cook at home in the instant pot. I wish their almond butter was in short wide jars instead of tall and skinny, so hard and messy to stir!
New follower 👍🏾
Guys like these are bitches
he needs to pick up that 128oz jug of lube....  power bottom bishhhhh
The problem with using the Cornucopia Institute as a benchmark for if Kirkland/Costco eggs are good or bad is that their rating system is horribly flawed. The Institute rates them based on responses to surveys that were sent to the producers. Since Costco didn't respond, the Institute gave them all zeros. The Institute list was originally produced almost 10 years ago. They provide zero details on when they surveyed producers or when they resurveyed them, if ever. And assigning a zero to a non-respondent in a flawed methodology. I've seen greater scientific rigor in a 6th-grade science fair project. Love your channel and Instagram feed, but please investigate the "sources" you are using before citing them. And please stop telling people to not buy Kirkland/Costo eggs based on flawed and misleading information. Also, Kirkland eggs now carry the Certified Humane certification as well.
sooooo.... i guess the big signs that say "Cage Free Eggs"  that you grabbed the eggs from are a lie?
I buy the Livfit Superfood Blend. Is it a good choice?
Clickbait! Eggs, Butter, Bacon and oils are cancer-promoting and absolutely NOT healthy.
Sure listen to the scrawny guy wearing a vest with an unlimited budget and no kids to feed ... do you even lift bro 😂
I don't think we need that much fiber in our diet lol
I don't waste money on fake kombucha sugar water.... Picks up bacon right after lol
I cant believe it , great video up to the part where you pulled out the bacon ! With all the great food research you've done you really should know about bacon or any pork products for that matter. Very disappointing
I also only buy Vital Farms, certified humane, eggs.  Only eggs I will buy.
No one needs that much booty??? You underestimate me.
We're all gonna die someday EAT UP overanalyze your food and you'll probably end up in a freak skydiving accident
Applewood-smoked bacon is smoked in arsenic poison. #DoSomeRealScience
New subscriber after watching. Intresting 🤔 Did not know about the chicken and vitamins. If only I came across this video last month. 🙄
Always avoided cooked chicken at Costco and now I MUST try it
quinoa and raisins?
I appreciate the information you share. I want to learn about the cornucopia website❤
This was great with lots of good tips. I have one serious beef with what you said which was about the salt in Kerry Gold butter. People obsess over the salt in butter, OMG. The salt in that butter is a natural preservative to prevent the butter from going rancid and it will go rancid easily and quickly, even in the refrigerator without salt. You have to freeze it to prevent that. And the amount of salt that is required is a tiny, tiny amount and shouldn't affect your cooking especially if you go by taste rather than following a recipe and adding a specific quantity of salt. I almost never use the amount of salt specified in a recipe. Usually, you need more or less depending on many other factors, like whether you are using salted butter.
The food industry uses terms like "gmo-free" and "organic" to overcharge people for a PERCEIVED benefit they do not get.
I  can  not  believe   they  are  letting  him  record  in  there
Please kill the music
😢😭😬😠 cost too much.
Love your videos, but from a nurse’s perspective, just remember some people do need supplements for medical reasons and cannot swallow large pills so gummies for adults (despite the sugar) do have a role!
The eggs at my costco are organic and pasture-raised.
Hi Bobby, the cumin powder box you showed in this video and asked whether we can eat that much in a few months, an indian eats that much in a month :) as indians use it in daily cooking and it is super healthy as per ayurveda
home boy....best video on Costco food...( im diabetic ) all these foods you talked about on this video are the ones I had doubts about....thanks ....oh yeah...just subscribed and liked your video ( and will like all of them now )thanks for the upload
How are you going to claim the chicken is full of preservatives when the sign clearly states there are none? Do you just pull this stuff out of your ass to trick ignorant viewers that you know what you're talking about?
The only Whole Foods over here is by the rich people who are in the top 5% and 1% (you know, those who can afford to pay $750k for a house in the Chicagoland suburbs like it’s nothing). Why? Because it’s for rich people lol. Or at the very least upper middle class. I live in a nice area, but we’re mostly middle class with some upper middle and I don’t think most people here, even the upper middle class, would not pay double the price for eggs. I understand WHY they’re good, but clearly the system needs to be changed first because we simply can’t afford that adding up AND a mortgage AND a car payment AND appliances or cars that break down, etc. (yes, even without eating out or going on vacations). It’s unfortunate, but it is what it is at the moment.
We don’t have a Costco but we do have a Sam’s. Maybe one day we’ll get a Costco 🤞🏼
The chicken actually is not all that unhealthy. https://youtu.be/hnymeCIhWaA yes it’s processed but it’s far better than most processed meats.
What about the canned Tuna? Yah or nah.
23 bucks for pine nuts!? dude take a road trip to new mexico and buy them from the dude selling out of the pickup! even with gas you'll still save money lol.
Well unless he raises his own chickens i'll take 5.99 over double the price
Hey bro, great content and videos you put out on YouTube in the groceries store.  Thanks for the tips.  Question about an item at costco, the Kirkland Signature Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon 6ounces in a can.  What do you think about it?  Good to buy or avoid it?  Thanks a lot man
LECTINS...since I got off peanuts + almonds + cashews the pain in my body has decreased majorly.
OMG I live Kailua Kona, Hi supposedly one of the most profitable Costco locations. We don't have 1/3 of the products featured in your video..😥 third world state Hawaii😲
You’ve mentioned in many of you videos your quinoa breakfast bowl.  I’d appreciate a link to the recipe.  Currently I eat a cup of cooked oats in water, no salt, and w/one tbsp of brown sugar for breakfast.
Art is cool and normal
I buy whole spices and grind them home whenever I need some for cooking.
wow he is saying kombucha is bad because it makes him "fart" and then he is condoning thick cut bacon and the keto diet which we all know is extremely corrosive to our bodies. wow I hope people dont listen to this disinformation. GET EDUCATED

I wouldn't buy most of these suggested items because they come in plastic containers and/or are non-organic.
The reason Costco's rotisserie chicken is so cheap is because they sell them at a LOSS! They lose ~$40m per year on the chicken.
Bobby, I cook with grape seed oil, what are your thoughts on that oil?
Thank you for removing the whistling Bobby😙
You ALMOST had me until the kombucha, DEAD wrong..  but that's ok..  carry on..  Trader joes produces and A LOT better for you then Costco!
Bacon really? Pigs are smarter than dogs. Yes, it's true, google it. Also, bacon is loaded with carcinogens, so essentially you are eating a cigarette.
Love this!!
Not my Rostiserrie chicken 😭
I'm an adult and I will absolutely eat my vitamins in gummies.
Love the Costco restaurant experience. Dollar fifty hotdog with drink while people watching. That's the life!
Hi Bobby love your videos but my only complaint is the whistling music in background is annoying sometimes your voice cannot be heard clearly. Thx for listening 👂
Bruh he stole a lot from another video
What's the point of living longer than everybody if you're so bitter,  complaining about the other people you share the planet with? Last time I'm wasting time on this miserable dude.
Great video! What about the bulk Pink salt that we get in Costco..Is it a buy? Thanks
This is really great suggests as long as your not allergic to NUTS
Get the cage free eggs that are RIGHT THERE THEN.
What a gorgeous no makeup beauty! Love your videos. ❤️ I learn so much from you.
I'm not buying it... puts in his cart🤣🤣🤣6:02
funny at the end of the health video he's scoffin down some pizza and a dog with a soda.  I would too.
Typical a hole who thinks he knows more than doctors - people DO need supplements, and some of us with medical issues RELY on them-dont listen to this obnoxious jerk
There is nothing unhealthy about eating Costco Rotisserie Chicken in moderation. The nutrition facts for the Costco rotisserie chicken: 3 ounces is 140 calories, 7 g fat, 2.5 g saturated fat, 0 g carbohydrates, 5.6 g sugar, 19 g protein, 0 g fiber, 460 mg sodium.. It may be a tad high in sugar but not in any way an unhealthy level, The sodium is probably less than what you would add at home with a shaker.   It is a time saver and the reason why it is cheap is because they sell it at a loss to get people in the store. They reported they lost millions just last year on them. They are now buying their own supply chain all the way from farm to slaughterhouse and the distribution networks ...the whole shabang! That will allow them to keep the price low. That said...I am not a fan. I like mine fried.
Fyi... My Costco sells organic free range eggs by the dozen for a good price.   The nitro cold brew coffee is sugarless and delicious!   Love your channel.
Does that peanut and almond butter have only ground nuts? Many have bad oils added in!! 😱
do whole spices last or not?
Where to buy quinoa?
makes me gassy and fart
Love your show!
Wooow, as a Dutchie living in Norway, the package sizes are insanely huge. The coconot oil container is insane :P
Love your opinion on juice. My family never buy ready made juice from the store, they are just water packed with tons and tons of sugar. Much more nutritious to make our own juice at home. I'm also skeptical of the rotisserie chicken at Costco. I know the store doesn't profit from them and just use the chicken to attract customers, but I'm sure they try to lower that loss as much as possible which equates to using lower quality chicken. Also, the amount of sodium in Costco's rotisserie chicken is ridiculously high.
What is your favorite protein bar?
Please come to Texas. We got Kroger and H-E-B
Hey leave my gummies alone
I do have a problems with emulsifiers. That explains why when I made a dish with the Thai coconut canned milk I threw it all back up.
Chosen food avocado oil is here in Christiana DE COSTCO
Olive Oil is not good from plastic bottle. Its wrong way to put it. In Greece and south Europe we put Olive oil into cans or black glass bottles. Sunflower oil is also only good in brown bottles.....
its not easy in usa to eat healthy i mean buy healthy because the food restrictions are not to hight as here in germany...i would love that usa stops using certain chemistry in the food ....at some point they must wake up....
I like him! Thanks for the videos!
Had fun watching you shop Costco....I shop the same way there.  I love Quinoa for breakfast and that is the bacon I buy at Costco.  As for the eggs....I broke down and have raised my own chickens for the last 6 yrs.....
Headed to Costco in am. Was crushed by eggs and avocado oil but glad I know
03:08 this reminded me of Chris Traeger and i believe, this man trained rob lowe in every aspect of his character for parks ans rec.
Why is canola oil bad for you?
you are so funny, Bobby and so is Art with all his food!! loooooooove your videos!! can you do BJ's,.Publix, Harris Teeter, Food Lion?????? dont know if you have these in Chicago.
You are way crazy  🤣 I was thinking iam the most crazy about food but thanks god I have u know
Thank you Healthy Guy..#NutrtionKing #LiveHealthyWithNoILLness
Fun video, I'm already buying most of those items. Sad to say I have been buying those chickens but will definitely pull that off my list.  Good tip on the eggs, they have a secondary organic egg option at my Costco.  I'm checking out Cornucopia.  Thanks!
Loved the video!!!!! Very informative😁
ALDI haul would be great!! Amazon too!!! I’m new to Keto and am lost but I’m trying
“When you can’t pronounce half the ingredients that’s a bad thing.” YES
The Rotisserie chicken is whats called a loss leader, they are selling it at a loss in order to get people in the door. Thats why its so cheap.
Good advice! The only thing is that whole food it is too expensive and some people can not afford it. So I think they just should stick with the organic brown eggs from Costco.  Great advice about the vitamins they are unnecessary. There are better qualities.
Arabs use them in ours dishes and mom does not like to buy them from Costco either so she will agree with you for sure. She only buys them from Arab (Mediterranean) stores.
Arabs DO go through that many spices lol we cook everyday for many ppl and use many of these spices you just named 😂
On Keto for almost 4 weeks, surprised quinoa is Keto friendly. Thanks for the tips!
love the information on this channel, instant new sub!
Coconut oil is TERRIBLE FOR YOU. 12g Saturated Fat per tbsp.
My
Get your kerrygold unsalted at Walmart! Comes out costing the same
You shouldn’t film at Costco, the manager should kick you out
If you're looking for quality whole food suppliments try out Standard Process.  https://www.standardprocess.com/  I've had a heart condition since birth and since taking these, my stale medicine breath disappears! It's amazing! 😁
Thanks for letting us know what's the best for your health and about which eggs to buy. Also thank you for saying that coconut oil is the best! Unfortunately a lot of people think that canola oil and vegetable oil is good for you but I think it's only because we have an easier time growing these foods in most of the States in the main land.
what about the teas and drink isle
People life and medical insurance can eat anything .. eat up .. per the sadistic
Just my opinion...but I think he comes off like a stuck up twit.
Good Grief....my guess is you'll live another 24 hours longer than the rest of us that don't obsess over all food you put into your mouth.
I'm sorry...NO bacon is healthy
Wow thanks for sharing
They lose money on the chickens to keep them $4.99
You can keep spices in the fridge to keep the flavor and their peanut butter isn’t the best taste, to me the best is ADAMS brand
"When you can't pronounce half the ingredients, thats a bad thing" ...um, no. When you can't pronounce half the ingredients you simply don't understand chemistry. Any regular piece of fruit off the tree has dozens of chemicals you probably can't pronounce in it.. it doesn't make it bad for you. Everything in existence is made of chemicals. https://www.businessinsider.com/what-chemicals-are-in-an-all-natural-banana-2017-6
It is not enough to complain about the low price of their Roast Chickens. They’re not sold for profit. They lose money on them deliberately. They’re sole as a loss-leader to get people In the store. They lose millions of dollars a day on them. They are bigger and tastier than ANY store bought roast chicken. That said, it is not likely ‘pasture raised.’
I think we all can learn from you. Americans need to stop buying products that have bad addatives in them thanks
Thank you for the informationI don't deep fry any more I use my air fryer for a y thing I would like frayed. I .make great steak fries from scratch using  1tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. My other comment is if so many y products are not good for us perhaps you could teach the store why they shouldn't carry somethings.just food for thought. Thank you Sincerely Deb
Helpful! Can you do one for Sam's Club? We don't have Costco!
funny how you preach about "humane eggs" (that aren't that humane to begin with) yet suggest bacon? The least humane and most toxic product on earth lol...
Does this guy know what the word "pantry" means?
I recently discovered you and I just love you! I love the great tips AND your knowledge and sweet disposition!!!!
They do not put water in butter....
I wanna see Aldi version.
I can’t tell if this guy is for real or not 😂
Watch "This Is Why Costco Only Charges $5 For A Rotisserie Chicken" ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qTZnwRbFY0&t=2s ).
So I eat gummy vitamins and you just call me a kid! Great job in subscriber adquisición. You will not get me to follow this Sams Club fan boy.
Still don't buy Marianne’s Harvest Brands 100% Avocado Oil? This is what they say on their website: "The oil is water extracted from the avocado fruit without the use of harmful chemicals and solvents, much the same way olive oil is made. We take it one step further and refine the oil to make it the perfect product that is suitable for all of your cooking needs. Marianne’s Avocado Oil is NON-GMO Project verified." https://www.mariannesharvest.com
Gonna be hard not to pick up that rotisserie chicken. Just how much sugar are we talking about? Do you get the chicken thighs at Costco?
Use discretion and don’t just buy something on impulse is the best way to shop. Love your tips for shopping and to be more selective! Thanks
You forgot to include the meat department..... but I guess they are all ok for keto except the process ones!
I like Costco have on sales, because I usually go to buy if they have promotion
My husband and I have watched this like 5 times simply because we love Bobby's energy ahhaha
Costco notes: Kerry gold butter, almond and creamy peanut butter, almond flour, extra virgin coconut oil, Mediterranean blend oil for deep fry, olive oil, extra virgin for salads, avoid pine nuts, hemp hearts , chia seeds, quinoa, avoid supplements
Ugh. Enough with the godawful 8-bar millennial whistling track. Also, boxed bacon is science’s gift to portion control.
Another awesome video!!! Thank you!
I wonder how many of the dislikes are because of the #$%!&* whistling.
You need to do your research on Kombucha!  Tons of health benefits, you are missing out my dear!  Great video content tho!
What a pompous douche
Most excellent. Thanks for all your hard work researching. I’ve researched rigorously and have come up with same info. I personally dont like Kellygold butter. Keep up the good work. My first time viewing and having a hard time stopping myself from watching. Taking a break😅
I want husband like u 😍
i dont give no hecks about this im still getting my 5$ chicken
Quite possibly the most annoying background whistling music I've ever heard.
Costco has admitted to selling the rotisserie chicken at a loss, do your research buddy before assuming its chock full of preservatives
I had the cheese pizza....it’s good; I had the hot dog, which is truly all beef.  For $1.50, it’s easy on the wallet and fills you up.  Forget the bacon.....pork is so stuffed full of chemicals that can make you more sick than what the man in the video knows......if his cameraman is eating what he says to avoid......well I go with what the cameraman wants to buy
Peanut oil is the best oil to deep fry. I’m white but I’m not this guy white. I’m southern so I’m not into all these pansy foods
Talk about being more confused 🙀 I like his  tips however I can’t afford most of the items plz do a video on healthy on a budget 😀
If he doesn't like Costco why does he mention it in every video he does.
You missed the main argument in favor of pastured eggs. They're cheaper!!! Pastured eggs are 8 to 12 times more nutrient dense, so if you're buying nutrients, the pastured eggs are cheaper.
Sams Club Please
I agree totally of the waste of money on vitamins and supplements. Been saying it for years if you lose the fast food in your life eat moderately healthy and work out a little you don’t need that crap. I know it’s easier to be lazy and unhealthy and think a pill will make it better but I lived that life and it doesn’t work like a healthy diet does. Not to late to get smart.
This guy is an idiot.  The rotisserie chicken is an amazing deal, the chicken is high quality.  And almost no commercial eggs come from chickens running around. There simply isnt enough land to do so.  Also organic is a bullshit label anyways. And dont buy spices at costco? You are paying literally 10 times the amount buying at grocery stores. And spices don't lose their f'ing flavor after six months. My mom had spices older than me, and they were STILL fine.
Yes Art!! Sometimes you just gotta have it.
You didn’t give a valid reason why gt’s kombucha isn’t good for you? You have a biased opinion can you elaborate more?
Dude is hella pretentious
COSTCO is the Disney Land of keto items with great deals! I miss Chosen Foods Avocado oil. TY
quit with the whistling repetition !
Pigs are not for human consumption. Pigs are God's garbage men. They consume junk... That's their job. Pork is BAD for you!!
Costco hotdog and pizza! Yeahhhh Art!!! Yum hahahahaha
Great reviews! As a frequent Costco shopper I enjoyed the content. You got a new subscriber!
My WalMart has expeller-pressed but not cold-pressed Chosen Foods Avocado Oil. They're processed at different temps. Is the expeller ok?
Really appreciate the video but the music is killing me. Aazrrrrrggggghhhhh!!!!
I saw a video here on youtube of a nutritionist & athletic coach that said chia seeds are gimmicky. Yes theyre healthy, but you have to eat so much of them that its impractical. Your body cant digest the seeds very well unless theyre ground up.
this guy's a tool
Nigga you suck
brown eggs segment was hilarious. People were seeing brown eggs, not hearing your advice. Marketing is still so visual.
That whistling music is too distracting and annoying I couldn’t finish watching.
I thought their olive oil in the plastic jugs was fake and blended w other oils (like most cheap olive oil in North America)
6:07 Almond Flour-  great to know,  thanks.
Of course Robert Ervine energy bar is for him to make bank and I betcha he don't eat them!😂
Please take the annoying whistling out.
Costco peanut butter is the bomb! Just the peanuts and salt and it’s super creamy and even has a hint of natural sweetness that is subtle but tastes better than the ones with added sugar and oils etc
hate people who film at stores for there vlogs. usually security kicks them out. let people shop in peace
I could only get through a minute of this video. This man's voice is hella annoying, HaPpY EgGs.
Thank you for this video. Can you video even more detailed about all the food products they offering there, not just the food of your interest zone. Thank you
Lol....maybe have watched one too many of your videos.  My husband and I went out last weekend and bought a Cosco Membership!!!  Love your videos, but can't do the Keto thing.  I do do Weight Watchers for healthy eating and have about 20 lbs to lose....I find WW more balanced than most eating plans.  Just keep turning out those videos!
Sorry Bobby, I stopped watching when you dismissed the roasted chicken.  Who are you shilling for?

Thank you for sharing your food/nutrition knowledge!!!!!
Really good tips.  ty  Just one tip for you.  The nuts at Costco usually are coated with a light starch to keep them from clumping together. Any nuts in a sealed bag probably have a coating.  Usually best to buy in bulk at Whole Foods or a co-op.
Keep up your good work. People aren't realizing over time how bad food choices cost your health in later years. Also the foods that are a good buy you point them out also. Yiu are a true customer advocate. Cosco should THANK YOU for calling these items out and reward you for your wonderful CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! much appreciated!
It's so helpful
Now I hate myself, I buy most of the “bad” thing...😥
He should’ve never said what he did about the supplements. Not everyone can afford fresh fruits, veggies, seeds, nuts, proteins daily so additional supplements picked wisely  are crucial for millions of people.
You buy the olive oil from Italy?  The mafia cuts the olive oil with formaldehyde. Buy from Spain or California instead
Really ???   pumped full of hormones and preservatives ?  Can you state your source ?   Why ?  Additive hormones are banned by the FDA and have been for the past 50 years.   Do your research and get yur facts right !
I liked the end where ART the camera Man is chowing down on a Hot Dog and Cheesy Pizza!!
Idk where is the Costco  you were shopping at, but OMG I can't believe how slow that store is. The one I shop at, is always packed, regardless of what day or time I go  :(
https://www.mariannesharvest.com/ This looks like a great brand of oil
Please apologize for your ‘middle age’ comment. You will be there eventually.
Hi Bobby, what do you think about chicken breast from costco. Or which brand do you recommend ?
Hey, you'll be a "middle-aged dude" someday... IF you're lucky. Disparage not the elders. And IF you're lucky, you won't have to work at the door of cosco or walmart.
if im there out to save chicken...i would love to think of me eating them out from their misery....being coup in a small cage eating bad stuff blah blah....not that happy chicken roaming around with their friends, happy probably thinking, dreaming of worming the next day and then poof there i was barbeque
Haven't you read the latest medical news Keto is not healthy long term. Please stop preaching it!
I appreciate the reviews. Read, read, read the ingredients! Thank you for posting.
Ugh... stop the whistling or piccolo!  I had to turn off the video it's so annoying.
"It's the BAUUM"
its the same chicken. just because you cook it, doesnt mean it is any safer.
It looks like lots of the organic stuffs are full fill in the store now...I wonder are they really certify ?
I've worked for Costco for 29 years. Our rotisserie chicken is hands down the best out there. It's $4.99 for a reason. Bobby Parrish, do some homework before you speak. We don't make $ off of it. It keeps members coming in and shopping. It will never be more than $4.99 just like hotdog and soda at food court. it's at least a 3lb bird. Go anywhere else and they try to sell you a dried up 8 hour old 1.2lb thing for $8.99. Also check out their ingredients. Costco by far is superior.
Dude...stop...
could we get rid of the hipster whistling? Please?!
BULL!!!   You need to look up the video as to WHY they sell the "rotissery Chicken"!!!   You are so stupid, anyone following you is insane!
cccar67 is correct. Most of the rest of you need to do some research.  Much of the US's food supply is in the tank--frankenfood.  Michael Pollen and Eric Schlosser have some very readable materials for starters.  Your government has sold you out--your food is likely killing you. Quality of food is not necessarily determined by taste.
Bad, Art! Bad! 😂. It was probably delicious 😋. 😂. Great informative video. Thank you.
"But I do roll with this bacon."😂 lol
I drink the pomegranate juice everyday😩 I was wondering how I was putting on weight
Unless he is going to by my groceries from Whole Foods or Traders Joe’s. Ain’t listening to a word he says. This should shut him down about the rotisserie chicken 🍗 https://youtu.be/3qTZnwRbFY0
What if I don’t like peanut butter?
You're wrong on so many levels:)
Do a Sam's Club haul!!! #FlavCity Awesome
I wish you could go back and do a better More Thorough job on the KETO aspect of buying at Costco for us that may be considering buying a membership.  I mean go down every FOOD isle and give the low-down on price and ingredients.  If there are only a hand full of savings then maybe not, it has to equal the amount and better it, on the cost of the membership yearly.  Ya know!
Thanks for the video! I would add though that you shouldn’t buy oils in clear containers (only dark glass) because if the oils sees sunlight it oxidizes and goes rancid. And similarly, I prefer to buy my nuts at Trader Joe’s because they sell raw nuts! As you said you should store them in the freezer because they will go rancid- that’s because they are very sensitive to heat! So if they are roasted, a lot of the nutrients are depleted.
Costco in SoCal still carries Chosen Foods Avocado Oil - let's hope it comes back to your store.
A Wal-Mart hual would be nice.
Thanks for your insightful videos.
You forgot about the Nuttzo.
Thank you for helping me and others my first week of no carb keto meals so hugs frm Sacramento and I love your videos
Lol when he said "LITERALLY" he sounded just like Chris traeger from parks and rec
The way he tried shaking up that black woman lmaoo
Good people, you have the choice to take or disregard advice. Just saying. This guy actually gives great advice in this video Main thing I took away: Read the damn label and buy organic.
I saw in a documentary coconut oil when heated is poisonous? Thoughts on that ?
Can you do one for wal mart
And where is the quinoa from?  Don't pretend to be some kind of global citizen without considering what is happening where the food is coming from.  Such as those chickens.  Who would want to eat a chicken that was lives knee deep in chickenshit?
People like this are super annoying.
1:36 The whitest handshake ever
Wow thank you so much for helping me out with labels, good prices, and healthy options you are amazing
Bobby Plastic bottles for Olive Oil? I heard the chemicals leach into the oil
Love all of your videos and recipes. Thanks. Keep them coming!
Can you make a pancake recipe using almond flour .
All Mono and Polyunsaturated oils no matter who makes it or what kind it is changes to Saturated fat once you put it in a pan on the stove or in the oven and heat it up. All Mono and Polyunsaturated oils are meant to be use in the raw state such as in salad dressings or used to drizzle on grilled steak, fish or chicken after it is grilled.  If you are going to use it to cook foods you should use a pump bottle and just squirt a small amount on each side of the food before cooking. Heat will change the molecular structure of any good oil fats to Saturated fats. Even toasting seeds and nuts over heat changes their good fat to saturated fat.
this guy is so wrong about bacon and some of other items id throw him out store he must work for wall mart
Species..just go  to any Indian store
Cheap as BALLS! LOL He said balls
Such a jackass. Dont buy rotisserie chicken because of price? This guy is plain trying to be oversmart. He is ignored the fact that this chicken contains seasonings/spices. Get your facts checked before you vomit out nonsense please.
What is a great tasting and good alternative sugar substitute when you're on Keto diet?
I almost got into a fight. I thought my roommate is wisteling. Please stop the background wisteling.😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖
Art knows what’s up lol. Costco is all about the $1.50 hot dog and $2 slice 😎. You forgot the fro-yo lol!
The shit this guy was raving over made me want to vomit.  I've tasted many "healthy foods" and,  unless you've been raised on this crap,  you will gag. One man's meat is another man's poison.
Hi Bobby, do you have your quinoa breakfast bowl recipe? Can't wait to stock up at Costco again!!
New subbie.  I'm vegetarian.  But I eat meat sometime (I cut way back on meat).  Like today, I bought salami, cheese slices, and club crackers for home made *Lunchables
You are awesome! Just followed you on Instagram... I do similar stories with my favorite market finds ! :)
I will like you the do a Video in bjs about wat is good for us to buy too thank you is been very helpful all your tips and recipes
you should do the 99 cent store
The if you can't pronounce the ingredient, it's bad for you is such a bullshit cop out. I liked the video, but that's nonsense
Can you please come to Naperville and rate a grocery store called ‘Patel Brothers’ - I am really curious as to the revelations you might have compared to your Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods trip!! Please try...you will thank me later 😄😄
Sorry but I enjoy this guy. I think he's very informative and helpful.
This is how I think when I buy food. 😆 OMG yes! Thank you!
Love your videos!! I have a daughter thought allergic to treenuts/peanuts. It's difficult most of the time I use soy.. I love Chicago!!
Loved your video and just subscribed. The only problem I have with it is that constant whistling music, over and over and over. It's really annoying and distracting. I found myself noticing it rather than listening to you!
Can you do a seafood video? Frozen fish, caned fish? Where to buy it, and where its most affordable
US chickens have no hormones by law . Brown shelled eggs are no more healthy then white shelled eggs they just come from a breed that lays brown eggs .
Are you on Keto? Is Quinoa and apricots, raisins Keto? I am confused ?
Make a video like this on Kroger!!
Discovered your channel today., I’m so bummed about the rotisserie chicken. Where else do they sell good ghee if I don’t want to make my own?
how about peanut oil?
Why is he hooked on shredding chicken? Roast chicken is delicious! Some pretty good deals here, though.
Why was this in my recommendations?.....waste of time.
Great video.  new to your channel.
Great stuff. People need to understand. There are great buys and poor ones. Love Costco but every store sells crap.
Amazon haul please!!!
Just found your channel and am loving it! I really appreciate this information but this background noise with the repetitive whistling is driving me crazy. Is it possible to remove the that background noise in future videos? Especially videos that have you explaining the products please please please 🙏🏻 thank you
Great job 👍 thank you.
Lol the hipster aisle
great
Interesting video but I prefer to make my own decisions about what I eat and drink.
Why don't you actually work at costco then talk shit... Idiot. 😂😂😂😂
Spot on with most of the stuff guys! I see a lot of lazy people are mad at you because they are too lazy to cook a proper chicken at home! Well, good for them! Keep up the good work! Thanks for the video!
What about those Cage Free eggs right next to the Organic? Are they any good?
You just don't get it,  mostly restaurants use the big volume items. And do your homework,  spices don't usually ever go bad! You are not right on everything you are saying... you need to do more research.
Was that the Costco on Damen and Clybourn??
“Avoid rotisserie chicken” *exits video* lol
But those Robert Irvine bars taste soooo good!  Cmon I'm 61 let me have my "protein" bars!  I buy the almond flour, the peanut butter (and make my own sugar free chocolate chips too with little molds I got from Amazon) and make yummy cookies, but I gotta have those protein bars for in between baking.  I gotta get that biscotti recipe.  We now have our own free range chickens and personally I would rather buy the cage free than organic, but luckily we don't buy much anymore with having the 4 girls (they were baby chicks in May 2018).  Also we don't buy bacon at all! My husband actually makes ours.  We give it away and people LOVE IT!  I think he sells more Traegers at the road show than the actual Traeger salesman! I just met you.  I apparently need to check you out to get some good recipes.  Thanks for the work. Our business is a block from Costco and DH is on a first name basis even with the demo people!
_You are GOOD AND HONEST THANK UUUU
I am a Costco fan for some things. I never buy deli type stuff, but do buy some packaged foods, booze, and their Kirkland brand of coffee for the Keurig coffee maker is the bomb, and such a good buy. I bought my grandkids pajamas there for Christmas. I hated the way they were packaged, were a pain to get unpackaged to wrap, but were good quality and the kids loved them. I just hate those plastic t strips that attach everything but know it might keep shoplifting down. Who knows. Anyway, finally we have a Costco within an hour of us. Life is good!!
Can you do a Sam's club haul please?
thanks for sharing the do's and don'ts at Costco
We Were friends until you started talking about the ‘Happy Eggs”!
Great video and very informative, thank you!
Peanut butter in Cost co is very salty!love Cost co but know I have hard time to shop there I have to use there Electric Cart 🛒 most of time there is none or is not working my Cost co do not have the coconut milk .And I really think this guy is Health freak .you still get old  and die.Cost co is fun shopping don’t grants you live for ever!,,, They have the best lamb chaps the best 🥩 Vile .
There is one problem with that butter is salty and I never get use to salty butter Why cost co do not bring  the no salt one I buy it from Net Cost it is Russian store.
15 minute commercial for Costco  1.3 millon views   smart guy
Just saw you endorsing coconut oil, so this video was made when coconut oil was the in thing! After further investigation it’s been found that coconut oil is BAD stuff.
Can see where your coming from, keto, gluten etc. what ever seems cool today, yet you talk about happy eggs? Weird
I love your video but would love for you to give warnings of the use of Palm oil, it is destroying nature and wildlife
He’s right but I eat all the things he said to avoid and my dr. said I am a healthy person, this guy is hard core health conscious
how did Costco allow you to film this ? You did put down some of their product .. i am surprised they didnt boot you out of their store .. just wondering .. just wondering .
Excelente video!! Thank you 😊
I disagree with the vitamin thing. I consistently eat healthy, but I work and I'm in uni and I'm prone to illness. I tried implementing more tea, oranges, orange juice, ginger, etc. to my diet but the only thing that actually works for me is taking Vitamin C everyday. Also important to take vitamins if you're vegan as well.
Don't eat the chicken but throw in some yummy thick pig bacon!! 😏
Lame.  Sorry if Kombucha makes you gassy, that doesn't mean it's not healthy.  And not everyone can afford Whole Foods organic eggs.  And Keto isn't the only way to eat healthy.
Actually, chicken is not allowed to be fed hormones anymore so that is not an issue. However, it likely has antibiotic in it. Mostly it is the way chickens are raised that bothers me. Not to mention their soy/corn diet.
Sorry to bust the bubble here, but I am a corn oil guy. Love the flavor and the way it makes fried food crispy and really good regardless of all the warnings.
Great video! Great advice. Please cut the stupid background whistling music out. Really gets on my Nerves!
I personally love getting cases of kombucha at Costco. The single flavor of GTs they carry just happens to be my favorite, the Trilogy. I know it makes some people gassy, but for me, it just helps me feel less bloated. Been adding a lot of fermented foods such as kombucha, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Been feeling great
Nah... I'll stick with the rotisserie chicken, rice, Costco organic eggs and local wheat flour for my baking since I happen to be one of few NOT gluten, dairy and whatever so-called, hypochondriac intolerant. Thanks for the vid tho.
Hey, nothing wrong the pine nuts is from China ! Even Italians works for China! So how can you trust the labels?
As a Registered Nurse let me correct you.  Gummy vitamins give a far superior absorption rate for older adults.  So your statement saying they’re only for kids is very inaccurate.
Canadian Costco are better 👍✌️☺️😊💕💕
Actos generic have soy milk in it
the prices in different stores and lactose milk
Actos milk a cousin different recipes in it like some of it has real milk some of it don't some of its mixed with something else doesn't work right what am I looking for in lactose
Like to know about low lactose milk which ones to get cuz there's all different kinds
Pine nuts come from italy? 0-o
Hi Bobby Parrish! I think organic eggs from Lidl are the best. 100% vegetarian feed & outdoor forage
Peanut butter,  got to be Adams!
And what about Vitamin D? You need to look it up.
Buy those pasture raised eggs you mentioned at natural grocers
Any opinion on the white Cage free eggs beside the organic?
Thanks so much for the information you are sharing, I have learned so much by listening to you. Keep up the awesome work 👍👍🤝
Could you do a Sam's club or do you think it would be the same as Costco?
This guy must be a blast at parties.
Interesting but the 90s called and they want you to go back there and say "the bomb" .
Guy, almost EVERYTHING in your life has chemicals. Do you eat dessert! Any sweet? How about alcohol? Its ALL bad for you! Do you order pizza? Yeah, everything on your pizza is not organic.
wow very good info
your just strange, i agree about the oils but that's about it
The coconut water you are drinking have added chemicals to keep it long. Real coconut don't last so long, it becomes acidic and bitter in taste. I live in a tropical county
Hi, I was wondering if you were gonna say something about sugar 🤔, what's your view on it? Please help 🤝
Bobby do you know anything about the Kirkland organic butter? Just found today. Sold in Canada, $6.99 a pound
That coconut milk is in a can, aren’t all cans bad because they are lined with BPA?
I used to buy Vital Farms pasture raised eggs too and I still do occasionally if I have to buy from a supermarket, but I’ve found farmers market eggs to be much higher quality, fresher and more golden yoke, also much cheaper.
Unless its a pet, why should I care about happy chickens when they'll be food soon?
I ❤️ vital farm eggs. Expensive , but soooooo worth it. ❤️
Toxins are stored in animal fat. Bacon = Cancer! Jillian Michaels got Keto right. Worst diet ever! Keto = Cancer and heart disease!
Avoid Costco, go to LIDL.
Background whistling doesn’t make you right.
They sell the Chosen Foods Avocado Oil at the Katy Tx Costco store.
He just like fat?
What Costco is this that the aisles are that empty? My Costco is more packed than a Superbowl stadium.
I loved watching this and the Trader Joe’s one as well! Helps out a lot to be mindful with what produce you are buying, can you do one on Whole Foods?! That would be a great help!
Yes you can go through that much cumin if you make curry
I can't eat seeds corn or nuts due to a colon issue. I wish someone would do a video on replacement ingredients. I have learned to eat hominy instead of corn. Can you help?
Canola oil is not only highly processed, but is derived from rapeseed plants. Rapeseed plants are poisonous. I used to work at a University where I worked with a PhD biologist who specializes in foods that were good for you. She told me canola oil is the worst oil there is; basically poison, due to coming from a poisonous plant. She told me to never eat it.
Keto can be expensive. He didn't show the price of the almond flour. Coconut oil does not make all foods taste good. I have tried it.
Dry herbs and spices don't go off they just lose some flavour over time but are still safe to use even a few years old
Our Costco prices is 2-3x of your Costco. Your coconut oil price is $13.95. here (Saipan) it's $36.95. quinoa there is $9.+ And here is $18.95..
They have Chosen Foods Avocado oil in Costco Canada...don't buy it all!😜
If you really want to know what's the deal with the meat here in the US watch food inc that should shed some light I can't believe ppl think that meat here is hormone free.
I want Costco pizza now...
I loved your Cosco video.  Please do more.  I was a fan of the rotisserie chicken.  But not anymore.!
Pine nut syndrome is definitely a real thing. I thought my taste buds where never coming back.
Wow great video!
If you're keto, get your uncured bacon  at WinCo.
We Indians use spices for almost all vegetables
I know I watched this a couple of months late. I recently became a subscriber because I watched your most recent videos and you  more than likely won’t read this; however, I had to call you out on a portion of this video...the vitamin section at Costco. About 5 years ago I moved back home/my parents  to help dad take care of my dad as well as I could (mostly administratively as I was(continue to be) disabled and was/went through a very difficult separation of a 25 year marriage (divorced by husband of 25 years). I did take of the family’s health/diet and continue to pursue a healthy education of food. I also have a daughter that has lived with me and brought with when I moved back home (Thank God that parents loved us). Anyway, I enjoyed your channel as well as some other Keto channels. I feel that you well educated on Keto. But, do not understand health especially for the elderly and or culturally and their foods. I happen to be Hungarian and was raised by the foods of my heritage for a lot of years and even now I teach my son & daughter to cook foods of culture but a better way, a healthier way. However, some vitamins are needed due to health issues, such as Fish Oil especially individual(s) with heart issues and or concerns. I hope that, maybe before you say such a statement has you did in this video that you may review such issues
Please do a video Sprouts store.  They have them in Chicago.  It is my go to store for vegetables and bulk goods.
Regarding oils - What do you recommend as a replacement for oil used in baking cakes, cookies, etc?  I am allergic to anything coconut.
Regarding spices.  Handy hint - At Sprouts you can buy spices in the bulk section.  So if a recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of coriander.  You can literally buy just one teaspoon.  It ends up costing much less than a bottle of spice that you may not use within 6 months.
BTW I am a new subscriber after watching only 2 of your videos. First was the Aldi and then Trader Joe's. Now watching this Costco video. Looking forward to checking out others.
I have to disagree with you on the nut butters.  I looked at the Costco peanut butter and the ingredients were not solely 100% peanuts.  It had some additives, salt for sure and I think oil too.  I much prefer either Sprouts PB found in their bulk aisle or Trader Joe's both were solely 100% peanuts with no additional salt, oils, sugar or other additives.  Americans already get to much salt in their diet, no need to add more.
"I can't buy this because I don't know if it was cold pressed." Talk about your first world problems.
Yeah, well,...that’s just like,..your opinion man.
You are talking about good healrhy food and your friend eating junk food haha. Guess what i feel like eating pizza 😉
What a wealth of info to consider. Will share your videos with friends - especially what to buy at Aldi's. Thanks.
You should do Save-A-Lot
I asked someone who has a farm and has chickens. I asked her about the egg color. She says it's all about the breed of the chicken. Each breed lays a different color.
My local grocery store says they only put salt into the cavity of the chicken when it goes in the rotisserie .  I noticed when you talked about the eggs here was a another product next to them and it said "cage free" on the box.
LOVE the info and your opinion on the items in various stores, but that whistling was so distracting. I need an Advil....
Bacon is healthy?
godddddd first world problems
I stopped at gassy... I have kombucha everyday and when I am between two homemade bathes, this ones are great... If you don't like it, you don't like it...
On my middle east/India cruise I used a bottle of gummie vitamins to hide my gummy THC tabs. They are useful.
Most Americans lack B12. Flax oil is needed for dry skin, eyes and mouth. I hear it's great for your heart too. Although I do consume flaxseeds often, as a vegan, I needed way more fat than what I consume on a daily basis.
Wow! So glad I just found your channel. Do you have a link with your Quinua breakfast bowl recipe?
A friend of mine was a farm inspector for the USDA.  The only organic product he said to NEVER buy was peanut butter from organic peanuts.  He was unable to describe it, just said it was disgusting and do not buy organic peanut butter, ever.
all good, the music though, I am sick of it.
If possible can u do a video on Sam's club or Bj's
This guy is talking about health and happy chickens.... but talks about eating bacon. lol This guy is a walking contradiction and comes off as condescending.
Seriously you got so much wrong. COld brew coffee for example does not have sugar, it's just black coffee. Try reading a label first.

Thank you want prepare for my next haul at Costco
Art got hungry lol
Your intentions are good but I'm surprised Costco didn't throw you out after filming customers. It is one thing to have an opinion but to interrupt shopping customers with yours could be considered harassment.  But Officer those eggs are bad... tell it to the judge :)
https://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/beware-the-new-kerrygold-butter/
I love brown eggs. The yolks are richer and they taste better. Thanks for the info on not buying organic or cage free eggs, I'll keep that in mind.
This has to be a joke your at Costco
Virtually all salmon marked “Atlantic” salmon is farm raised (artificial dyes, chemicals and causes much destruction to local wild Pacific salmon where the fish farms are located).  The real deal is wild Pacific salmon. How to tell the difference - price!!   If you get a huge inexpensive pack it’s farm raised. Bad for you, bad for the environment.
Lol cheap as balls
Disagree entirely about his issue with supplements.   While eating right and exercise is always good, it still is often times not sufficient.   Myself... I have hypothyroidism so my absorption rate is screwed up, requiring me to not only take supplements but to take a higher amount to achieve normal levels... also environment plays a huge part... I live in southwestern Washington state,  rainy season from October till May.... I can guarantee you thst majority of people here are low on Vitamin D3.... he should of handled that differently... and if one is going to buy supplements costco has great deals on them... not only great deals on supplements but on their OTC medications.
So judgemental. The points are valid but the video comes off as only being preachy
Could you please turn the back ground whistling music down..It is distorting you speaking.  And it is very annoying...the whistling.
You should NEVER buy olive oil in a plastic container.
I just found this by accident, thank you so much for all this information and all the recipes!!  I love you guys!
Costco's chicken tastes like it has all those terrible additives in it........... like they are trying to "disguise" something!!!!
Very informative and you make sense Thank-you
How about making rotisserie chicken with flax seed sandwich? Lol
Butter, really? Credibility gone.
Hey I like that rotisserie chocken !!
This guy denies science and just lives on hippie fake news.  He should pay the stupid tax at Whole Foods every day.
Thanks for the info but this is the whitest video I've ever seen
oh Bobby you're breaking my heart! Avoid the Costco rotisserie chix? Oh yeah. You're right. Roasting chix thighs at home is a healthier choice. No one needs all those additives in food. Dang. Love the prepared convenience tho. I am fortunate to have co-workers who raise chickens humanely and sell eggs at work. Great Costco tips. Thanx pal!! I enjoyed your Costo visit including the end bit with your buddy finishing up with a slice and a dog. Funny!
Could you please check Smiths?
What about the free range eggs right behind you? They taste wonderful and the shells are so hard, I can't believe they are less than healthy. Adding to your comment about peanut butter, the Kirkland brand of organic peanut butter has no flavor. I baked Christmas cookies with it (adding extra peanut butter than the recipe called for) and they had no flavor. Sadly not one of my friends complimented me, I just wanted them to enjoy them. Regular old Jif has waaayyy more flavor!
Will it work for making scrambled eggs or an omelet?
dude!! kill the whistling music stuff ~ makes it hard to watch! O.o
5 minutes of my life i will never get back. glad i didn't watch the whole thing
Do you have evidence that Costco eggs are factory farmed because they are sold as Organic Cage Free Eggs?
I went gluten  free  and I miss Costco pizza...
Sorry to tell you but some do need the vitamins and there because some aren’t able what they need out of there food you did have some good info on some things
Good video, BUT PLEASE get rid of the whistle in the background - can't hear your comments all the time because of that obnoxious whistle!
I am a new Costco member I Hate going to mine  have only gone 3 times~ the staff are so rude and the place is so hostile , I had been a member of Bjs for over 20 years always liked it thought Costsco would be the same , but its not ,or maybe its just the location I am at ~ I only decided to Join because its closer than BJs  to where I am living ~ very disappointed, also the produce is not good I bought tomatoes and cut into them and they were all bad looked fine on the outside not on the inside, very weird
We will attempt to quit Costco this year altogether. #breakfreefromplastic requires us to stop compromising our values for convenience.  We would quickly come back if they take responsibility for their packaging and start accepting all those plastic bags in which things come in. We will be posting how muy we save or hope to save by buying only by bulk after a few months. So far so good!
This Guy is over critical about the products. He buys what he likes . So do I. It doesn't mean its a perfect choice . Costco  Rotisserie chicken is the best . If your worried about the seasoning take the skin off before you eat it. Enjoy.
Just subscribed cuz you make pretty good points 😊😉
Very honest reviews. I love it.
The extra ingredients in the rotisserie chicken is just the stuffing... if it’s a problem just don’t eat the stuffing.... my issue with a $5 chicken is the intensive farming practices used to grow a bird so cheaply
The addition of vitamins may be necessary for certain needs, i.e. b12 for those that don't drink reg milk, vitamin d for those that live in cloudy, dark regions of the world; calcium for women's bone density that naturally depletes with age.
Some people here are being ignorant to the knowledge that's out there for health! Your loss!!!  Occasionally eatting bad is not that TOXIC.  But not all the time like we do out of ....  I appreciate this guy and I'm on food stamps!
Thai Kitchen coconut milk still uses cans lined with BPA.
Costco hates you
I don't like shopping for bulk food items they take up to much space and they don't have a lot of variety to choose from and the prices there are good on some items not all. Grocery shopping in a wear house no thanks I'll stick to my grocery stores.🍓🍌🧀🍞🌶
Robert Irvine 🤦🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️ hay shy hay ....😆
Bullshit, idiot; Costco sells the rotisserie chicken low as an advertisement to get people inside the store, and as they walk out you magically buy more stuff.
Isnt this a violation of Costco terms and conditions and soliciting??
I won't follow this  advice to the letter. But he made some good points. Thanks.
did you read the signs on the chicken?
You lost me at the chicken. I'm out.
Wow!! Thanks for the heads up on the chemically processed rotisserie chicken  and the caged corn fed “organic” eggs I will definitely find me eggs elsewhere where they roam freely and not fed corn !!!!
The fact that this guy's name isn't "Craig from Portland" is flooring me.
Re: Oils at Costco.  Costco does not sell 'TOXIC" foods.  You could use a proper definition. You're not a chemist, nor a scientist.
That was so much fun, and the ending was perfect!
I love Vital Farms eggs, too!  Completely agree that they are be best eggs
I eat very similarly to the way he does. I also feed my family this way and on a budget. We never need to visit the doctor because we are sick. I appreciated this info because I shop at these stores and regularly buy many of his recommended products. I love the tips on where to get the best prices for quality food.
The most inconsistent, shrill, preachy person ever
I would love to see a haul from Walmart.
... I personally found the information to be very interesting!  Thank you Bobby Parrish!  Turns out... I'm already doing most of what you mentioned... the rotisserie chickens have always tasted funky to me, so I don't get them.  The eggs and as much of the rest of our food as I can... I buy local, free range and organic whenever possible!  Grow what I can too.  Always makes me ill to see the negative comments... people hide behind the internet and post the rudest things.  What happened to kindness?!?
How where those pigs treated to give you that thick bacon?
You don't "roll" by paying $5.00 for cold press drinks, but you will pay double the price for organic eggs at WholeFoods. I go through 4-7 dozen eggs a week sometimes, and for baking and I am not spending double the price for a good conscience.  That said, your section on oils was informative.
Is this the Mettawa Costco? 😆
Organic eggs are still better for your body than non-organic which have pesticides!
What do you think the garlic salt at Costco as well?
This guy really acts like an arrogant ass.
i would not want to shop with u =(. though u probably mean well
Great info...thank you!😊
No rotisserie chicken??  NEXT
Uk 🇬🇧 Costco doesn’t sell half that crap you have there
po-cans? what
I’m sorry I didn’t like how you laughed throughout the store... making fun of what we thought it was good. That’s not the way to teach anyone. I like your other videos though
Pro-tip for people getting into cooking or nutrition for the first time, ignore people like Bobby who tell you to buy organic, avoid GMO, or to avoid certain brands or to just buy thick cut bacon or European butter, etc. Bobby can afford that type of privileged pickiness. There is no actual science that shows organic or non-GMO foods are healthier for you. Focus on eating/cooking a cost effective and easy meals. It’s funny Bobby gets mad at hipsters selling expensive juice and then tells you to buy expensive eggs.
What about Lidl?
When did coconut oil become healthy.  It’s a saturated fat just like palm oil.
Spices are great at Costco! If you use Taco Seasoning, Garlic Powder, Cinnamon, and especially their Organic Salt Free Spice Mix (whatever it's called) ... great on chicken, meats, veggies!
Love your recommendations, do you have a video for Sprouts?
So my  dad should  not  do this  I will  tell him okay
The music was so distracting.
Actually those chickens are really not as bad as most other chickens, You come off really jerky,IMHO interesting he would pick on that. Also,not everyone is rich. That 4.99 chicken and a few side dishes can feed a family of 4 that were forced to because of finacial reasons.
Costco loses guite a bit of money on rotisserie chicken sales, it is a loss leader.
but i cant leave costco with out the vegitable chips!
Wow.. Look at all the negative comments.  Perhaps if more people did their science research on these foods they'd realize you are right.   Btw.   Try AROY-D coconut milk and cream.. Excellent..No additional test. it contains just coconut milk 60% AND Water,  Cream contains 70% cream and 30% water.. DELISH!!
Yeah, don't get chicken with sugar in it or fruit juice but, by god if its high in cholesterol or fat then by all means throw it in the cart!
LOL...I love Art eating that garbage at the end of this type of video...hilarious!
The rotisserie chicken is perfectly fine.  The modified food starch, etc. - ingredients actually in the spices rather than the chicken itself.  No big whoop.  It's fine.
The assessments and recommendations were extremely uneven. Healthy bacon??? Keto, c’mon??? Healthy butter??? Better than the organic eggs??? What about the treatment of the pigs and meat chickens??? I do agree on pasture eggs the higher square footage the better and Costco nuts and butters
https://youtu.be/0ZIgtLzCqTk?t=802 You mean eat "well", right?
Very fun video and informative to watch though I don’t live in the US. Keep the good video going!
LIFE IS SO REAL
Wish you would of noted where some of these products were made.
I stopped at Kerrygold.
Thank you sooooo much for all the healthy tips. Helps a lot not to buy the wrong stuff thinking it’s healthy. Looking forward to browsing through the recipes.
By the way Costco specifically changes the items on the Isle so when you keep saying I'll 307 those items won't be on I'll 307 in my Costco and even if they are the Isles change they do that as a marketing strategy making you are forcing you to shop through the entire store in order to find the items that you love the most
We LOVE these videos, can you do more stores like whole foods and walmart???
The eggs I just bought from Costco say they are Pasture Raised / Organic. Hmmm
All those vitamins/supplements are garbage. Full of fillers
Hi, I'm from here in Chicago also! Your video showed up as a recommended video and I am glad it did because my husband now has a heart condition and will be having  bypass surgery soon and I need to cook better for my family. We are Mexican but I also have German and Italian in my family from my Mother's side. I have shared two of your videos and will be sharing with others now. THANK YOU ❣️
When you go to Costco to ooze your white privilege everywhere
Do a review on sardines sold as Costco.
He’s actually savage “I’m not gonna call you out” and then proceeds to call the guy out. I was smiling so hard
The Costco chicken was never meant to be “healthy” Costco loses money on it, they just sell it to try and get you into to store, same with the cheap pizza and hot dogs. Costco isn’t perfect but they got good quality stuff for the money.
Aldis is great! They have many more wonderful healthy items than he showed organic for very reasonable prices.
Thank God Bobby Parrish, you’re our new Anthony Bourdain… not! Bite your tongue as the word “hipster” leaves your lips. You’re only here to deliver the audio effluent as a self-anointed, free-range guru of your salt-free, condescending gibberish.
Would love to hear your opinion on celery juice, bulletproof coffee/matcha, and drinking lemon water daily in the morning. I see a lot of fitness influencers recommending these but I'm not sure of their benefits.
No eggs are happy eggs
RIght next to those organic eggs are cage free.
Banning California near Palm Springs.
11:25 cripple guy walk by
How is it like to have a husband like him?  Well...the marriage won't last.
Amazon shopping video, please!  Thanks!💐
Haha, clearly Art sticks to being cameraman and doesn’t follow your preach 😄😄 but glad to see you not eat the junk!💐
Si I need to cook with oil but you disqualified all kinds, except olive. In my city is too expensive to use olive oil. So what kind of oil is healthy for cooking everyday and cheap enough to deep fry stuff once in a while. Thank you.
Hi!  Like watching your videos.  How about Meijer, Target 🎯, Walmart and Kroger!  Would like to hear your take on them also.
I'm never going to stop buying Costco rotisserie chicken, its the best sold for the price!
What is a good Cinnamon to buy? Which are the "real" Cinnamon.
google "loss leader" -- they are taking a hit on the rotisserie chickens to bring in business
Art I understand Costco has the best Pizza EVER
Costco’s rotisserie chicken are non gmo, no hormones or add preservatives!  They a price so low to bring in business.
Thanks heaps, Bobby! I shop at Costco for the items you've covered in this clip. Your clip has informed me well and now  I know to what to buy and not to buy at Costco.
Art is the man!!!
My Only thing is you picked up almond flower that was BLEACHED...any thing Bleached is harmful to your health.
loved all 3 halls.  great tips and great buys.
You are what you eat. Try farmers market.
I have watched your Trader Joe's & Aldi's video's very good!! thanks for sharing! I never buy anything with Canola/rapeseed oil, not good for you, unless you believe snopes hahaha
Seriously I eat healthy but yeesh...enjoy life a bit my friend...we all die someday...don’t get crazy over diet to the extreme....pirate booty is bad? Yep..let’s eat seaweed grass instead..nope..u can have my portion...
You don;t buy canola oil but fall for those fake blends that are 90% canola oil, just more expensive.  Coconut oil is like pure saturated fat....
i love your  watching you i learn a lot
The guy is crazy... kombucha is so healing to the body 🤦
These are his opinions.
Almonds and walnuts are a must buy.
Bacon good, juice bad?
I closed the video when he said chicken is healthy, obv meat ain’t healthy
I wish you would have given the size and price of the coconut oil. Also was the peanut butter only nuts and salt? Otherwise I enjoyed this info.
The stuff in the chicken is likely in the flavoring that it’s coated with... don’t eat the skin.
Costco rotisserie chicken is fantastic.
Sams Club!!
Bit of an excuse for him to push his own food agenda. He tosses out opinions and personal fads as if they were somehow "true." Overall, this CAN prompt us to shop with more purpose, which is good. Needs warning though, that all this is his opinion and personal preference. He demonstrated his subjectivity bigly (which is also totally fine) when he tossed off the comment that "thick cut" bacon was superior and the best and the only one to eat - and thick cut was somehow morally and health-foodly better. Ha! I dislike thick cut, myself. Just saying - he sometimes confuses his agenda and taste with God's Holy Truth (I think God likes uncured thin cut bacon, like I do). And he's simply misinformed about the chicken. His "facts" are incorrect - he just ain't right.
The whistle music is very annoying... please!
Walmart carries the Chosen Foods Organic, cold pressed, Avocado oil you speak of currently at the best price. 😉
Weight lifting with the oil. Lol
Thank you. Didn’t feel like the gym this morning but no way could I skip this
I don't understand why America uses feed lots for meat and dairy, in Australia and New Zealand, we do grass fed, America has plenty of farm land, surely?
Could you also cover the meat in Costco? A meat haul please...!
New sub. Thanks for all the info. The worse thing to take is vitamins yrs. Ago we went to a homeopathic doc. She was also a nuclear physothis , she said vitamins were very hard and toxic on the liver. My husband trashed all of his. He is 77,I am 76 we have always tried to eat good food and not to much. Thanks for your blog I will be watching.
This guy is spot on!
I love this series! Did you do whole foods yet? I saw the others which helped me a lot :)
Love your videos. Absolutely hate your ‘whistling’ music!! Gets on my nerves immensely. Could you find a different music please. Thank you.
What are your thoughts about Costco frozen chicken?
Omg. Turn down the music!!
The anus cornhole corpia slimstitute , Mr team creamy avoids middle age hetros at Costco lol vitimans are bad. ?
I like your store gaula!,
Thanks for the videos thanks for the good information!!!❤️
The whistling is awful!!!!  ugh, my ears hurt.
New Mexico, my home state has the best Pine nuts!!!! You can order online too. The pine nuts or piños are grown naturally and fresh. Lots of flavor varieties as well!
I love Costco's rotisserie chicken and hot dogs. I do not eat them on a regular basis. So, I feel safe in eating them and I will not stop eating them because of this guy's opinion. All this video is is this guy's opinion. I do not know this guy and his opinion means nothing to me.
I am surprised you’d endorse the olive oil which is cut with cheaper oils (for cooking) and flax seeds that are already ground and hence lose their nutritional value.
WinCo Foods has better prices on your do buy items
couponers can get vitamins cheaper then costco prices
yep saw another show about chickens. it said that the term organic eggs are used loosely in the world of egg reproduction. They can use the word organic as long as the chicken is eating right. not because their able to walk freely.
Can you do a Haul on BJ's please
Rotisserie chicken is something you get when you have no time to cook. My mother lived til 96 at the age on 80 her doctor told her her cholesterol was to high. She laughed at him and ate what she pleased. 96 and didn't go from being sick.
You sound like an elitist asshole btw. I spend $120 a year on the membership. I am going to buy and eat all the rotisserie chicken I want.
Costco sells pasture raised eggs and you can't even pronounce kombucha.
Been reading ingredients for years.. and I also do lives about all the crap in processed foods no wonder everyone so so sick..
I wish this guy was my friend. JK. I would rather put my head in a blender.
It bothered the crap outta me that he messed up the signs and didn’t straighten them out. AND put the coconut milk back backward 😡
Cucino italiano co prodotti italiano da witros  Aldi non capisce prende solo monezza. E pure tedesca
Io sono italiana ma come fate a magma sta shifezza.
The normal olive oil not the extra version
Your olive oil is just canola oil in disguise you need to buy olive oil that comes from California or in the USA and is in a dark bottle
The Best Buy's are the  Kerry gold butter? Right behind him was the organic grass-fed butter which is the best buy !
Elder people - they prefer gummies because they cannot swallow large tablets .  So the older population take gummies and feel good about it.  They continue to include vitamins that will help them as they age.
You are the best!!  Love your realz!
It says cage free eggs on the box you idiot.
Lol at how he's jumping on the pop garbage hipsterbashing bandwagon. Hard to take such a mindlessly socially obedient thrall seriously at all. I'm outta here.
Did you buy coconut oil in a plastic container?
Great content. Thank you for all the good info! (On a random side note...please get rid of the whistling in the background)
most of it comes from china and china owns cosco
Tell the truth about American butter. Don’t lie. The difference between American butter & European butter is: American butter is whipped from heavy cream, the liquid left over after the butter is removed is buttermilk. Clean & simple. European butter starts with buttermilk & sour cream. The buttermilk & sour cream are mixed together & put in the fridge to ferment overnight. Then the next day it’s whipped until the butter comes out of the solution.  So, the difference is American is made from pure heavy cream; Euro-butter is made from a fermented buttermilk/sour cream mixture. European butter uses what we consider a waste product from American butter! Tell the truth. Another thing, why aren’t you feeling sorry for the poor pigs that gave their life for the thick bacon? It’s all about what you like isn’t it? TELL THE TRUTH!
Great video! Thanks:)
Hate the whistling but would love some of the products here in the UK!
Can you do a Whole Foods top things to buy? I watched all three videos and you referred to them in every video. Thank you!!!
But you eat pig??? Nastiest animal in the grocery store. Read up.
The Kirkland Organic eggs at MY Costco are Free Range. I buy several pckgs at a time. Sorry about yours.
I’m from Chicago, and I can tell who in the comments are from the north side of chicago Lmao love your videos dude, people callin you a snob is so annoying!
This was awesome! I enjoyed watching ...wasn't boring at all. Thanks for all the info.  Where can I find your recipes?
I shop at Costco regularly and have for years.  The rotisserie chicken is the best and we love it.  I use it for chicken salad, casseroles, sandwiches, noodle soup, sliced with barbecue sauce and more.  It is delicious and a great buy and I am going to continue buying it every week.  Thank you for the other suggestions.  I have watched labels for many years and glad you are encouraging others to do the same.
Thank you, I finally learned which bacon to buy. Without added sugars of course.
OMG...LOVE YOU BOBBY
Walmart Haul Please...Thank You
Can you do Leto Sams club???? ❤️💯 I have watched your videos for the first time today as we start our beginning of the year Daniel Fast. You have so much good information. I am preparing to have a healthy life even after the fast! Thank you 🙏🏾
What does organic even mean? If chicken eggs can be called organic although the chicken live in cages, why would we ever trust the “organic” label...
Please don't throw shade on us middle aged people.  There was no need to make that comment about the guardian of the gate.
Costco chickens taste awesome and Costco uses them to lure you to the back of the store. They know that they lose money on every chicken they sell but you always go to the checkout with over $100 in items.
I like how he tries to convince people the eggs aren’t good quality yet they resist his voodoo preaching and get the Costco eggs.
so happy I found this channel. Looking for another on Sam's in the future!
Nice info! Pine nuts, never got costco's, too many and now I know not to get the Chinese ones! Hey, adults like gummies too, just not the expensive "vitamin" ones 😂😂😂 too bad that Harbor doesn't sell the food/fruit juice colored ones around here, all you get are the artificial colored ones, must be more appealing to the American eye.
I just love you ,thank you so much for your hard dedicated work.
Love, love, love this channel. More useful information! I shop in our local "Fresh Market". Are you familiar with Fresh Market? Do you know anything about Earth Fair Markets? I have to travel over  20 mi. to get to a "Whole Foods Market" but I do it anyway. However; I did discover an Earth Fair Market just 3 mi. away. I think I will check it out. But, if you have an Earth Fair in your neighborhood, would you consider providing a consumer report? Also I have been trying to keep score between Cost Co, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's.  For the price, of healthy foods, which is the best buy to shop in and for the highest quality of healthy foods which is the best to shop in.? Are you able to tally it up? Because I'm not; I just get a head ache. I am trying to come up with an over all best place to shop in. I don't mind having a secondary store to shop in,  especially for those really good items but I would rather not have a third and fourth store to shop in if I can help it. The simple life is the life for me.    I haven't had a pizza in about 10 years or so. I think my salivary glands went into flood mode when I saw Art eating that Pizza but with a hot dog, man,  you were going for the Diablo affect. Is there any left?
So animal products that clog your arteries and contribute to climate change are "good for you"?  LOL.
Hey, you even said pecan correctly.  Ahhhh, thank you from Texas.  LOL
I am an ingredient hawk! You have to look at the ingredients in what you are buying. Things that seem healthy are often not. Clean eating is my goal...
So what’s wrong with pirate booties? Lol
Go to farmers market!
You are such a likeable guy! I am going to subscribe. I will look for you. As of Thursday I will be a demo lady in Chicagoland!
The best part is the guy eating crap at the end! LOL
Can you do Sprouts?
Kerrygold as unsalted butter...which you know by now because of comments?
Thank you. Great info! I am always looking to reduce ingredients. My 5 or less can be hard to achieve. Keep going!
Go to Sprouts
Thumbs up for “more like... protein bar impossible....ly disgusting” 😂
These American prices are amazing!! I forget how expensive Canada is till I watch videos like this.
This snob makes me so mad. Why did YouTube have to recommend this to me
The only eggs I consider to be organic are from my own chickens, they roam around eating flies and I don't feed them corn. The difference is just unbelievable.
Ok, so you are telling me to stay away from the kombucha but recommend buying butter and bacon. Sorry, I can't pass through half your video. Non sense, I do hope it's a joke!
What about the honey aisle? Is Manuka honey really that beneficial?
Rotisserie chicken, fat in the butter=saturated, eggs? organic=stupid moron, bacon= stay away from all Costco bacon, horrid flavor. Half wy threw the video and I'm gone, this guy has no clue.
I love this vlog. It's all about reading labels! Can you do Mariano's? Please.
Yes it has MSG & stuff - but DAMN it's THE TASTIEST chicken I've EVER had & it's cheaper than buying it raw!!!
You should make a Vidoe on Sam's Club😊
How about the other protein bars they sell? The Pure Protein or the Kirkland brand? Are those any good?
One of my favorite YouTube channels
I get fresh farm free range eggs from local farms for $2.00 a dozen 😁. Yuk fully cooked bacon👎👎thick is totally best from my local butcher shop who only buys locally😁. Oh I cannot believe you would buy your olive oil in clear plastic 😲. Always always dark glass.
Canola oil is toxic. Most olive oils are cut with a lot of canola oil. Coconut oil to fry, organic hemp seed oil for salads are best.
Take thin cut bacon and fold in half. Delicious!
Pun. Chickens shouldn't be cooped up! Lol
They own the ckn farms
There is no almond flour in any Costco in New York City... Unbelieve!!!
you know the difference between almond flour and almond butter, about 6 seconds in the processor.  Make your own.
Awesome vid!!  Go to Publix
You love saying USA chicken has hormones.  Why?
People allergic to tree nuts...no one address that.  Autoimmune diseases.  [not expecting you to help or solve those issues, I’m just saying. I know a few people that your favorite aisle would kill, including myself].   However, great info for one of my best friends who is kept and GF!  I shall pass the info on.
The reason it’s $4.99 is to bring you into the store. They actually sell at a loss.
This guy is stupid.
I love Kerrygold butter.  I use it when I make my Irish Soda Bread every year for St. Patrick's day.  To off set the salt I cut back on adding additional salt to my batter.
I'd love to see you do one for Sams Club or BJ's!
I love Kerrygold cheese, especially the Dubliner flavor. They sent me a huge haul. I made a video on it. Great product and great company.
Someone stop that woman at 2:19.....Noooooo  ... don't buy the smart balance!!! ewwww
amazon and a regular grocery store please. thank you
I have a question about vitamins. I had weight loss surgery years ago and I’m told I have to take an array of vitamins for life due to malabsorption from a smaller stomach. Should I assume that the doctors are accurate?  Should I not be taking vitamins?  Am I wasting my money too?
The repetitive whistling back track is soooo annoying.
You are right, but also have a whole lot of money! I could never afford to shop as you do. Wish you'd talk about living healthy on a low budget.
Thoughts on the Chosen Foods avocado oil spray?
Annette; Bacon has always been healthy most of the crap this guy is talking about will kill you yuck....Hal
You’re trolling that’s not good because you confuse people you say that healthy food is not healthy
We can get fresh Piñon (pine) here in New Mexico !!
CHECK OUT THE MILK TOO.
"No one needs this much booty" as you put it in your cart lol.
I don't know if you've gotten the Grocery Outlet there in Chicago yet (it's big in CA), but they get a LOT of Costco's castoffs and often it's priced lower. We still have the Chosen Foods oils and they're also at Grocery Outlet. If you DO have GO there, check it out! They're all very specific to their neighborhood (independently owned), but ours has an amazing selection of healthy products.  Thank you for the video, I was laughing at how you were saying so many of the same things I do! And I won't buy the rotisserie anymore...you're right and I shouldn't be doing that just for cheap convenience! I love Costco's frozen b/s organic chicken thighs!
love your videos! thank you
at trader joes the peanut butter costs less. its $2 for 16 ounces ($.124 per ounce)
He neglected to mention the best facet of Kerrygold butter - it's from grass-fed cows.  Kerrygold guarantees at least 90% grass-fed - it's usually 100% but during some harsher winters they have to bring the cows in from the pasture.  GMO feed is guaranteed no more than 30% of the 10% non-grass, or maximum 3% of the total feed.  During many years it's 0%, but it's guaranteed a maximum of 3% at any time.
There is no such as organic in the usa becasue farmers has a mortgage to pay so they have to use anyhthing to have a good harvest to be able to pay their mortgage.
Egg is egg.chicken feeds on corn.
TY for the great advise and reminders of just because they Say its  good...doesnt mean they are good.
What a boring video
I’m so happy every time I see the egg issues talked about because I raise my own chickens and don’t have to worry about that. It’s also insanely cheaper. I have enough birds to give me two dozen eggs every day for a lot less than six dollars. I just have to go out in the yard and pick them up.
I Love their. 9.99 pizza even though it's 4,000 calories
OMG! I was just saying in my mind about those organic green, acai and pomegranate juices, how bad they mut be. I juice greens every other day. I was thinking what would be the fastest option when I dont want to juice greens. But, you confirmed it, I will continue to juice greens!!! Thank you!
Thanks so much for this video. I have learned so much.  Pammie from Chicago
You sure that olive oil is real? Lots of fake olive oils on the market. I would not trust it.
Wait. That applewood bacon. Is is dry cured? Otherwise thick sliced is only a preference not a health consideration. I am suspicious that Costco would sell a dry cured bacon because it is so much  more expensive to produce.
Online Amazon 🤞🏾🤞🏾
If you would do a Sam's Club shopping video that would be very helpful for some of us.
sugar in the roast chicken, dang nabit, even my deli meats have sugar. drs orders i gotta go wheat, dairy, corn, grain and sugar-free. some wacky inflammatory thing going on in my body. trying to get control of it. basically, I'm keto with no dairy. been a hard week. I'm grateful you are bold enough to speak the truth so people can make an informed decision.
Vita cost, Thrive Market, Amazon Foods, please.
the rotisserie chickens are packed full of hormones, but the thick cut bacon is the only right way to do it?  This guy is full of dextrose.
that pizza looks sooo good😍 😂I'm about to make my califlower pizza right now 😉lol... thanks Bobby for the tips🙋🏾‍♀️
The organic quinoa really is terrific. None of that soapy taste that other brands of supposedly pre-rinsed quinoa have. Hint: Dump desired amount of quinoa in a DRY saucepan. Toast, dry, over medium heat till you smell a lovely aroma and some grains are popping. Stir is needed, but not constantly. When nicely toasted, add required amount of plain water and cook as usual. This is GREAT!!!
Thank you.  You are so informative and to the point
Spouts!!
Happy egg?  You are an §€£¥|£££]][^_¥¥.
Had to dislike the video because of the chicken comment... There is no ethical consumption of animals. I'm not a vegan, but even I know that.
This is a very good vid.. I can pronounce all those words and sometimes wish I did not know what some of them are.  Cargeenen gum is bad for you Guar gum is good for you.  There seems to be no reports of any significant side effects of carrageenan. Allergic reactions to carrageenan are possible. Vegan Yogurt? Have you lost your mind?
Can you do a video shopping at whole foods?? I mainly shop at trader joes, Costco, and whole foods and you have such great advice for a newbie who wants to eat more plant based and healthier and telling is whats more expensive and where is so handy too. I tend to not look at prices and just check out and the next thing I know I’ve spent wayyyy over budget!  Oh! And since you’ve talked about eggs at Costco not being cage free and stuff do you have a recommendation on where yo get eggs that had better treatment?
Nice info...good to see you representing for Chicago, too!  On the subject of gummie vitamins.....yes they have sugar BUT if you cannot swallow pills easily because of health issues and you can’t afford highly expensive liquid vitamins....gummies are the way to go.  You’re a young Turk and your body systems probably function very well...kudos to you on that...but when you hit the “senior” level of life...that inability to swallow pills easily is just a pain in the ass.  My life!
Where are u getting this info from?? I know for a fact that eggs at Costco have a “certified humane” label on the carton. Not to mention they are cost effective.
I've had pine mouth before, horrible. Lasted for 7days. Made everything including water metallic and butter tasting
What about the "cage free" white eggs that were next to the brown eggs?
I love how he talked so negatively about vitamins, but the first ad that played on his video for me was a vitafusion gummy ad. Lol OAN: How much is this dudes grocery bill, because he didn't buy anything that he could actually make a meal with and the stuff he picked up came out to at least 180 bucks. Yes, I know he is buying in bulk, but dang.
Regarding the chickens at Costco...this guy's an idiot and has obviously never heard the term "lost leader" in the retail world. It's also why those chickens are in the back part of the store... to make customers have to go through the whole store with the hopes they will (and probably always do) purchase other items they see. On top of that those rotisserie chickens are great and even a bit healthier if you remove the skin as mentioned by Dr. Oz.  ;>) Then he talks about the organic eggs not being organic which is, by the way, different than "cage free". Funny how as he's bashing those eggs you can see the other eggs/boxes that say "cage free". Is he blind as well as stupid???
Entertaining and fun. Keep up the good work!
You are worried about the organic chicken egg chickens and their comfort??? Please, before you buy that pig flesh look how they are treated and killed.  And suja “uber greens” IS NOT SUGAR water.  It has almost no sugar in it...it’s a “greens” juice.
I enjoy your videos but the music is distracting. Hard to listen to you talking while music is playing at the  same time.
Thanks for the tip on the rotisserie chicken. Never occurred to me to look at the label.
Never buy olive oil of any kind in a plastic bottle it is just one of many signs that is very low quality
I’d like to know what time and day of the week he was at Costco... so I can also go at that time and day...
Great video but please stop the whistling background music. Thx
Really, coconut oil is supper saturated.  You need to check this out with a few nutrition experts, then make you comparisons with other oils.  And, olive oil in clear bottles is also not the way to go.  Otherwise, good review
😍😍😍👍
This guy drives an Audi, raves about buying eggs at Whole Foods, says their rotisserie is bad because it’s cheap, I’m gonna guess he’s one of those people on the road.
Your friend is not keto!🤣🤣🤣
Adult gummies digest easier for me. I have digestive issues.  Not stupid,  just different.
I use to think the same thing as he does regarding supplements but I've had life long insomnia, not just since getting older but started in my teens, and anxiety (like everyone else in the world).  I added 5 HTP and Gabba (supplements) to my night time regime and voila, no more insomnia and feel so much better!  So if you are deficient in something, supplements can help.  Oh and my husband has an enlarged prostate like most older men and was prescribed a common prescription for that and started taking Saw PawMetto (sp?)  and doesn't need the prescription any longer.  He wasn't a believer either.
Nooooo Canola... even blended not healthy TOXIC FOR YOUR BODY
Pretty nice that Costco even let this dude in if you ask me.
This was a fun tour around Costco! But my favorite part was catching the guy at the end with pizza AND a hot dog... LOL!
Can I ask you for BJ’s review? Love your videos! Yay!
So you are on a diet (ketonic) otherwise you get fat ? Don't think so. Not buying gluten...so you are intolerant to gluten  ? Don't think so...and to milk ? Sure...   I think that you are a hipster who reads something an then he also needs to live by that rule...
Pine nuts at Costco is 100% real deal! China has a few organic farms in Northern part of country where those beautiful pine nuts grow. They are at the good price and always delicious :)
I have spices that are years old and the finished results are fantastic, the dealers want you to throw out spices and drugs out after a short time that has no relationship to reality!
3:20 *says that their organic eggs are bad* *customers tell him to pass them the same eggs* LMAOOO
The amount of calcium a woman needs cannot be obtained from a daily diet. She needs calcium supplements.
Did he really try to give that adult, African American Woman a HIGH FIVE? I love world travelers who have no idea how to interact with the cultures right next door.
You guys are awesome, I learn so much about my home Costco today. Thank you from the bottom of my heart💖
Chicken thighs are disgusting, too juicy and fatty
Wow!  Glad I found your channel.  New subbie!   I love me some Costco and Trader Joe's.... yes sireee!
Kinda lost all credibility at the end with Art stuffing his face with a hotdog and oversize slice of pizza, especially after dissing the shoppers about their eggs and oil choices on camera.
Hey, your videos are fun and I enjoy them. If you eat bacon and delete butter maybe you haven't discovered the beauties of a lard. Lord has half the price of coconut oil and it has a high smoke point. It can actually fried about 365° coconut oil at about 365° as well. I actually bought a deep fryer that is nicely tucked away on the back corner of my kitchen counter. Here's some more beauties of lard, your house / apartment doesn't smell like yuckiness because it's a natural oil it just wipes down with no problem if you've ever fried with synthetic Wells IE vegetable, canola sunflower Etc you know that that stuff does not wipe off ever! Try the Lord. $6 is the most I've ever paid for a tub. Give it a try
No just no canola oil! Its deadly...research
Hes a Ass Hat
Hahahaha
hi i like to know as to when you will be making a video on air cleners a revew would be verry nice thanks keep up the good work
Did Walmart pay you to come & Bash Costco
Sorry all the vitamins annoy you at Costco.  For me. It's a God send.  Same vitamins I can buy elsewhere but a much better unit price.    I take a Super Vitamin B Complex and it comes from Costco.  As does almost every vitamin I take.  Omega 3, Vitamin D, Magnesium, and more   Your words were rude and hurtful.  I am totally disabled an have autoimmune conditions.  You wouldn't last a week in my body.  So I take the vitamins my doctors have told me to.  I can't get up and go for a run.  My lower back was destroyed in surgery, so I'm stuck dealing with it.  Next time, stop and think before you open your mouth.  You don't know who might watch your video.
Um...  Bacon isn't good for you.
FYI Canola oil is Rapeseed oil. It's only called Canola because it's made in Canada I.e. Canada Oil = Canola.
Not a word about the increased price for brown eggs over white.  The egg color is due to the color of the chicken and should not cost more based on the shell.  The nutrition is the same if raised the same.
This guy is a joke. He picked the worst possible oil for frying. Not only it’s canola it’s also olive oil and grape seed oil both of which have a low smoking point. That’s guaranteed carcinogens when fried. Out of the Costco oil selection avocado oil is the best for frying.
Did you make sure that bacon came from free roaming happy pigs? Or does that standard only apply to eggs?
Shelled nuts can be either fumigated or heated, in order to preserve them. Costco nuts don't tell you how they are processed, so there's no way to know if they are fumigated. I'd rather stick with Whole Foods for nuts.
I am new to US and whatever Costco item's you suggested as not good for health, I am eating that from past 8 months 😫😥😢
Hello! which is better? Costco or Sams ?? to buy Keto products. Thank you ☺️
Kerrygold grass fed butter is the best. It also has unsalted version available in winco. I use the unsalted butter to prepare ghee at home.
Happy eggs? No eggs are happy eggs. The male chicks are all killed in the egg industry. Not to mention the diary you are buying came from farms where the baby male cows were killed and the female cows were forcefully impregnated and babies were taken away. The meat you bought was from farms where the animals were not treated well and then killed. Why do you say you care about the wellbeing of egg-laying chickens, but yet are a hypocrite when it comes to other things you buy? Also, keto will kill you. That's how Bob Harper almost died.
This guy is an idiot! He's passing his opinions off as facts.
Well, this is certainly an entertaining video and it has been very informative. For instance, I have been wondering why most of the young people in this country are so different and clueless about life. I thought at first it was due to poor parenting by folks who had rather party and take drugs than to care for their off spring. However, I have now found a better reason and that is because you all do not know the value of eating a normal diet. No matter who you are, or what you eat, death is total in every generation and you will eventually die. Knowing this you should eat and enjoy it while you can. Now since none of you are birds you should stop eating grains and seeds and other weird things and start filling up on collard greens, fried chicken, potato salad, hamburgers, chopped BBQ, hush puppies, cabbage, seafood, steaks, fried or creamed potatoes, hotdogs, chicken livers, and any other good and normal food available. Normal is what most people do most of the time. Most people in the USA do not eat strange things. This includes bugs, snakes and other sickening things some people eat in other countries. People who have eaten normally all of their lives often live in good health on up to their 90's. I have noticed people who eat little or strangely have minds that operate too fast and they tend to get off into areas they shouldn't be in at all. Too much knowledge is dangerous. When you get in that area you forget how to relate to other humans. Your mind is going too fast to be courteous or caring. Leave off the following for a safe happy life. Cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, gambling, consumption of drugs, playing the lottery, driving too fast, guns, adultery, fornication, murder, stealing, lying, cursing, jealousy and read your Bible everyday. Also, go to bed at night and sleep. Do not be a night stalker! You cannot soar with the eagles in the morning if you hoot with the owls all night!
The Mediterranean oil wasn’t available in Hoover Alabama.  I found it at Costco.com
WHAT??!!??! “Nobody needs Pirate Booty in this size.” I beg to differ! 😋😂
Conflicting comment section 😔
Pine nuts in italian is pinoli and not pignoli or piñoli
I invite you to read carefully the extra virgin olive oil label, you will find a surprise,  this oil is imported from Italy but the oil came from Spain, Urguay and other counties.
CLICK BAIT... Titled, “10 healthy pantry items at Costco.” And 80% of the time he is bitching about Costco products and prices.
Canadian chicken doesn’t have any chemicals, like our milk, zero chemicals!!!
Your way of analysis was confusing and non-practical, so hard to understand.  Should I say 'Biased' in common word? Not really helpful at all. Why you focus on all kind of oils? Disappointed. If you don't like it, just don't buy it. PS. I shop in Trade Joe, Costco, Whole food, also local farmer market in SF. Smart shopper for sure!!!
Hormones in poultry are illegal in the United States. This guy hasn't a clue what he is talking about and needs to delete this mis-informative video.
Any bacon is good bacon you fruit
shut the fuck up.pine nuts are fucking expensive. pinenuts from china are valid
After watching your video I realized why my American-Made butter, including the American-Made European Style butter melts waterish instead creamish. WATER ADDED? Insane! Never again American Butter.
I will tell you also somebody that cans butter on YouTube canned castco organic butter.  Well this same woman makes organic lip balms and face lotions so she can recognize wax when she sees it. While she opened up the canning jars and showed us how the top layer of the Castco organic butter was nothing but wax melted and water.
You're highly annoying and I don't trust anything you say. Stopped watching this food snob!
APPLEWOOD smoked bacon is DABOMBDOTCOM!!!
My Costco sells unsalted Kerigold
I am  so surprised that  this guy doesn't know that Costco sell it the chicken for no profits , and they just sell it to attract customers. and also Costco plans to rise their own chicken in  farms in (Nebraska/ not sure)  with  farmer partnership.
Thanks for the tips. Now I want to check out your recipes!
If you are prone to kidney stones,  chia seeds are a huge problem as is black pepper.
Curing your own bacon is the best.
If you're "gluten sensitive", are you required to wear skinny jeans?
03:10 - What the f*** is a "HAPPY EGG" ????????????,  Who IS this guy?????!!!
What a great video   I really love your enthusiasm and energy I appreciate your videos keep them coming take care and thank you 👍😜
I love Kerrygold Irish butter it's the best butter to make ghee or clarified butter out of.  I've tried many butters and Kerrygold Irish butter wins.
Do YouTube a favor and stay off it.
this guy must be paid off by Wal-Mart to sabotage Costco
Depressed chicken eggs are cheap.
Who the hell r u to say whats good or not your not a doctor. U may do some research. Definitely need to do a disclaimer
Bitch please.
millet is better than quinoa
any oil in plastic is not preferred
The USDA addresses  issues of animal living conditions. USDA regulations mandate that livestock, including chicken, labeled "organic" must be allowed "access to pasture" during raising. This requirement includes "access to the outside, direct sunlight, fresh air and freedom of movement."  So Costco's Organic eggs are good because all organic eggs are required to meet this free range requirement.
If you have kids, you definitely buy pirates booty by the massive bag buddy lol!
The chicken is 4.99 because of the bulk...
Great video! thank you for sharing your tips! following you in IG now!
How out of touch can you get? People shop at Costco for low prices because they may not be able to afford Whole Foods. If it's not a good deal, point it out, but don't shit on people for buying organic eggs just because they're not the #1 organic eggs on the market, which are twice as expensive and probably not in the budgets of those people.
So he doesn't like the brown organic eggs, but what about the white cage-free eggs right next to them that he ignores when telling us to go for cage free eggs? Hmm. And not all his "healthy" choices are so healthy, like coconut oil.
That's a nasty thing he said that just because the rotisserie chicken is cheap, it must be filled with garbage, how would that lower the price? Makes no sense. The truth is that Costco subsidizes those chickens to get customers into the store, they lose money on each one.
the whistling is killing me, but the info is good
A great place to get coconut flour is TJ Maxx! Sounds weird but that’s where I found mine and I haven’t found it anywhere here in Charlottesville but there.
This guy was going OK till he started talking about nothing he knows about, Supplements. The American diet is missing so many vitamins and minerals, supplements help so many people.
What a stuck up snob.
I am going to have to ask you to make a list of good stuff and bad stuff thanks for sharing
Most of the good staff disappeared from Costco in last 2/3 years.
The music is so annoying and distracting.
Funny how you tell people about the eggs and they still buy them😦?  Not many people care about quality they buy whatever they need not what’s truly healthier.   I buy these eggs all the time but after watching this video “no more”!!  Thank you so much keep up the good work! 👍😁
Stop the whistling
This video is very ignorant.  He speaks like the average dweeb that believes every stupid thing that the alarmist "news" tosses at him.  Ohhh, chemicals!  Bad!
Costco chickens are hormone and antibiotic free and have recently moved to cage-free.  Unless you have a sensitivity to wheat, corn, rice, tapioca or potato embrace the modified food starch. (flour) It is used to thicken or smooth the texture of the food (you know, like Mom's gravy). Dextrose is simple sugar that is made from corn and likely contained in the brining solution.  The chickens are brined and rubbed so probably a bit high in salt but.....you're not supposed to eat them every day, right?  They're a treat.
Don’t buy healthy PLANT items. Just buy dead animal and unnatural dairy products. ‘Cause THAT is healthy!  Read How Not To Die by Dr. Greger.
This guy don’t think anything is good there oh well I am still going to buy it
Dip shit
Terrible Video. If you can't figure out what you need by yourself at costco don't go. Pretentious and loves hearing himself talk. Biggest waste of time.
FYI olive oil isn’t supposed to be light yellow.... that’s bad oil (and good oil shouldn’t be in something clear as that further degrades it).. also for China- they can put anything (even poison) in anything (even food)... they have no regulatory laws and cos in the USA will just claim ignorance... even cos that manufacture over there and try to be environmentally ethical and enforce USA standards, the Chinese managers go behind their backs and do everything as cheap and unethically as possible ... and I assume a lot of the chicken ingredients are seasonings ... and there are many items stores will sell below cost to draw customers to that area to pay for the extremely over priced items (bread is usually one that’s sold pretty much everywhere below cost)... you’ll notice any sides you may get to go with the chicken like Mac n cheese is about $12 a pan and probably cost Costco $1-$2 to make at the bulk prices they get from suppliers (maybe I’ll even be generous and say $3)... plus when you talk about pricing, you’re not factoring in membership fees...
You buy olive oil in plastic bottles?  That's just wrong.
Buy spices by the ounce sounds all very well and good but it's also how long those suppliers have had that item themselves before you buy it therefore it isn't fresh.  RESEARCH.
Almond butter and peanut butter will contain preservatives to keep on the shelf also anything that has added palm oil should also be avoided.
Bacon? Bacon is full of nitrates and is a known and proven carcinogenic food. AVOID.
the rotisserie chicken is the best at Costco. Also, he’s rude with the comment about middle aged people. He needs to stop giving unasked for advice.
Thank you so much for the useful information!!!
You know i became more aware of foods after a health issue that i had recently. I check my labels, & found how much unhealthy food is at Costco. Check labels, i was going around looking at comparing all typed of frozen food just checking labels, & their frozen chicken, beef the salt/sodium is very high, because of the preservatives to sustain shelf life. So please check labels, you will see what i mean to just compare.
Very insightful video. Good to get some education on the healthy aspects of some of these products. I'm a fan of the fresh fruits and veggies sections which are great buys. Costco is great for large families and definitely good to know what you are feeding your kids. Nothing beats the extra virgin olive oil for all cooking. If sunflower oil is available, is that a good substitute for canola?
F
Should be titled, I like to blow a lot of money at whole foods. Mr picky  and finnicky! When you are on a budget, you can't spend hundreds of dollars on sterile food! Buy a few things at Costco and go to a regular supermarket.
My kids love the chicken.
It's Costco chicken all the way! The main reason I got Costco membership. lol.
$4.99 chicken is fine and delicious.  Have you heard of "economies of scale"??  They sell so many chickens that they can cut their profit margin to almost nothing, because they make up the difference with foot traffic and brand/store loyalty.    You have no idea what you're talking about with half of this stuff.  Just because you don't know how it's made (avocado oil? hello?) doesn't mean that it's bad!
First time watching your video and Omg I have learned a lot !!!! Thank you
I buy Jif natural at Meijer for the same everyday price.  No soy too!
he lost me at butter then said you have to have the bacon. no honey
They have great organic beans and tomato products.
This guy knows his stuff. However the music with the whistling has to go 😁
This guy eats like a bird.  Seeds nuts oil and bacon. What a delicious menu he must have at home.  Haha
Do you use the Ghee from Costco?
these days only paper is good to eat....smh
I'm vegan, mostly due to my autoimmune disease.. costco has great hummus prices.. and produce
How much y'all wanna bet dude sneaked a bite of Art's food, though? 😂
Your kinda a douche.
don't buy a rotisserie chicken but buy bacon? You know how unhealthy bacon is?
Nobody care what you said of the eggs😁😁😁😁
Hey mayo you not are from the hood ok baby
They should NOT kick you out of Trader  Joe’s I went in after your video and bought everything you said was good. So they owe you haha
I used to buy a whole frozen chicken wash and season it well then put it in my crockpot on low and let it cook slowly ...it’s inexpensive and super tasty..you get the chicken for one meal...then the carcass we used for chicken soup...delish..
Can’t believe the comments below!  A lot of people don’t care about nutrition until they get sick. Thanks for this review and the truth about chicken, eggs and other items. You are so right on!
What’s WRONG WITH BEING “A MIDDLE AGED MAN OR WOMAN”??? (Re: some of your first words spoken in this video.)MY INSTINCT WAS right ON, turns out — to NOT SUBSCRIBE TO YOU!
Good lord dont buy things at whole or barn stores..if u ever saw the amounts of rodents in those places and yes they do get in the bins!!! Every whole goods type stores sprays regularly with chemicals for beetles and use chemicals for mice and rats  .I buy things in packages that way if they are not chewed through then I know no rodents got at it
Chicken thighs, are injected with chemicals just before they are packaged. CHECK IT OUT. Any meat you buy in American stores you think is a "whole food" may have extra chemicals you have no idea are in there.Do your research! Also excito-toxins  or glutamic acid is the "G" in MSG,are added to almost everything. Code names for them are "Natural Flavors", "Citric Acid" "Yeast extract" "enriched". "fortified" "spices", "Broth", "seasonings" "fortified protein", "enriched protein",are all  just a few of the code names for glutamic acid which ruins the frontal lobe of your brain. Check out the book by Dr. Russel Russel Blaylock,, Excitotoxins:The Taste That Kills. I bet you at least half of what you have in your cart that  you are recommending people buy have excito-toxins in them.
get the eggs at whole foods they're twice the price... UM YEA WE CAN AFFORD 12$ eggs on the regular ffs.
Honestly, you don't look that healthy so I don't think you are really qualify to be giving nutritional advice.
You re full of shit. You are saying you can taste happiness in the organic eggs. What a load of elephant dung.
Please lose the background whistle music. Was listening to your critique, noting the background music was unnecessary, when my husband said (from afar) that he was ready to break whatever machine that whistling music was coming out of. Haha. If you want people to listen to your message we only need your insight; what might be annoying background music to some isn't required.
You can refrigerate or freeze your spices and herbs which makes them last a lot longer.  I still fry the pre-cooked bacon on a griddle. It cooks really quickly without grease spattering all over the place. You don't pay for the fat with precooked.
Vast pool of medical research proves nutrition- vitamins, minerals and proteins and fats are vital to human health. You cannot get any where near enough from food to achieve optimal health.  Supplementing is required to protect health.  Because someone says something on a video does not mean it is at all valid.
I had no idea until these comments that Cosco had so many stans.
Thank you for clarifying so many things that we put in our bodies! I would like to see online quality supplements or and or online food things from Amazon thanks!!!
you talk about spices going bad if you buy in bulk, but what about oil? Unless you eat oil on everything, thats going to go bad too.
Great info! TFS!!
So many haters. Thank you for the video!
The eggs said cage free chickens, yet this idiot is saying they are all cooped up. Idiot.
He's confusing quality with his particular and peculiar political views. Gluten is actually very a very healthy protein. It's only bad if you have celiac disease or a particular allergy which is very rare. Coconut oil is very bad for you. No one should trust this guy for any health advice. Ask your doctor like a normal person.
OMG, life is too short to live like this. I believe in balance and moderation. If you shop like this you'll need a second job.
Massively pretentious, hopelessly clueless- making this video totally useless.
How much did Costco pay him for these videos
Hmm... The "KETO" "GLUTEN FREE" BS just happens to be way more than normal food.  Do you all feel like sheep now?
Their cinnamon is d'bomb ... you'll go thru it... XO, Kelly ps get chickens
How do you do Keto if you have high Cholesterol, High LDL!
The background whistlers MUST GO NOW.  It's shrill, annoying and gave me the worst migraine I've had this century.  I really appreciate the analyses and reporting of the various foods, fats and fallacies of the food industry.  Thanks
With the spice you have to remember that costco also cator to business such as restaurants. So business can use up fast.
CHICKENS DONT HAVE FRIENDS THERE FUCKING CANNABIS. I GREW UP ON A 100 ACRE CHICKEN FARM!!!! THEY WILL GANG BANG A HEN AND KILL HER THEN EAT HER !!!!!!! DONT FUCK WITH A ROOSTER !!!!!        PEANUTS ARE BEANS YOU FOOD SNOB ARROGANT DUMB ASS     ALMOND FLOUR ACTAULLY ISNT GOOD FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU END UP EATING A LOT OF ALMONDS AND ALMONDS ARE HIGH AS HELL IN FAT... KEEP FAT AT 15-30% OF YOUR CALORIES IF YOUR GOING FOR HEALTHY. IF NOT HEY BODY BY OREO CAUSE THAT GOURMET COCOA HE PASSED IS AMAZING LOL     THEY SELL DEEP FRY OIL IN 5 GALLON TUBS AT THE BUSINESS CENTER, JUST SAYING. I SOUS VIDE SOY I DON'T USE.     THEY SELL COCONUT WATER 12/ 1 LITER BOTTLES IN A BOX FOR CHEAPER THAN COCONUT MILK    THE PRICE EVERYWHERE IS BETTER THAN TRADER JOE'S. ITS NAME BRAND ALDI'S      NO PROTEIN BAR IS GOOD THERE ALL FILLED WITH SUGAR SO THEY TASTE GOOD     HOW DID YOU NOT GRAB A BAG OF FROZEN FRUIT. THEY MAKE AMAZING SMOOTHIES WITH COCONUT WATER!!!! YOUR THE DEVIL    ALSO COSTCO SELLS THE EXTRA MOST BESTEST 40 LB BOX CHICKEN BREAST BONELESS SKINLESS FOR 1.69 PER LB....
People who are always  having  to swallow  medication  everyday, like gummies,  because you  get so sick of swallowing  PILLS!
I’m a little curious why you make such a big deal about avocado oil but not the olive oil.... the olive oil in those big containers is not true olive oil, and is a blend like the other oils. There is not legal requirements for labeling the oil. But you have no way of knowing how the oil is extracted on those big jugs of olive oil. Put that olive oil in the fridge and if it doesn’t solidify in some way... it’s fake
I stopped shopping at Costco because I do not agree of that company's policy of laying off supervisors/ managers who've devoted at least 20 yrs of their time for that company. The bottom line,   Costco does not really care if you've been loyal from the ground up. To prevent people from retiring for pension, they would rather lay you off before it gets to that point.  This happened to a friend of mine who is now struggling.
Surprised Costco let you shoot this and put down their products . I don’t shop at Costco
I'm starting to see Chosen Foods avocado oil and mayo in the grocery stores here in New England! 🙌
The only you should cook with is avocado oil. Oils like olive oil hydrogenate into trans-fat when heated at cooking temperatures.
Yea, China is a small country, we don’t have wild pine trees.😂😂
Bobby Parrish, you are full of “BALONEY”.  You really do not know what you are talking about!  Why don’t you compare the COSTCO products with the other big grocery store such as Walmart, Target, Trader Joe, Safeway, etc. in the same category & comments?
Italy is the only country that has real pine trees?
i cant believe costco hasnt sued him for lying and saying their chicken is pumped up with chemicals and hormones. hormones are ILLEGAL in the united states.
Love the video!
Animal products are not healthy. Clickbait.
Your an idiot.
Mayb I should think about renewing my membership.  I just hate walking out with $300 of stuff and only 4 items in my basket.  Ambivalence is real.
i love that coconut cream from Costco!
My husband I enjoy your video...was SURPRISED at middle aged greeters. We ARENT greeters....but surprise my husband is 81 years old and works our gardens and farm daily for8-10 hrs daily. Enjoying new, easy recipes....honor the Elderly....we made the way for the next generation....like you😀
Waste 5 minutes of my time on BS.
Not a word is real!
He thinks only he is right n we all wrong
Coconut oil is bad for your health. It is a proven contributor of coronary disease.
The lesson in this is you have to read the ingredient label and understand what it means.
This is funny. He may be annoying at certain time, but he bashed people that seriously needed to be bashed.
whistling soundtrack is incredibly annoying...

Besides the chicken and the egg corrections, coconut oil is very high in saturated fats, and canola and vegetable oil is low in saturated fat. Saturated fat raises your cholesterol, and the American Heart Association recommends you eat 13g per day maximum. Coconut oil contains 12g per tablespoon. Coconut oil is worse for you. That's all there is to it
Açai sugar water? 🤔
The Costco rotisserie chicken is way too salty for my taste.
Why did I click? Why why why
My family supplies organic eggs to Costco.  They have free range chickens that are not all in a cage unable to move.  You should go visit.  And maybe do a little more research.
He is a liar!
But Costco doesn't have coconut flour for those of us who are allergic to almonds.  I get so sick when I use almond flour.  Yes - bring back Chosen Foods Avocado Oil!
No one store has the best prices on everything. Who is this douche?
Ok, this guy is supper annoying ...... Good info though.
I am going to check these out in our Costco in Kanata (near Ottawa) I never know is it really healthy or not, read labels!  Learned the hard way. Thanks for the quick tips! 👌🏻
Sorry but pre-cooked bacon is the best! We eat less fat, oil and bacon. Not Keto family, but on balanced high protein and we are losing weight.
Almond butter depletes our water supply
Sounding a bit like a pompous ass here. You got kids Bobby? Teenagers? I got an idea, when they want BLTs at random times, you come to my house and cook up that fresh bacon. I work 60 hours a week and have a house full of kids. Shortcuts are necessary sometimes. Sorry friend, but ease up.
love this. please bring videos like this!
What the heck. The whistling 😙 was soooo annoying.  I had to stop 🛑
"God knows how much sugar is in these..." READ the label, you won't even have to ask god!
So much helpful information 😊
costco pizza is the worst.
Buy your cooked chicken elsewhere...too much water and fat pumped into Costco roasted or BBQ chicken
if you're on keto, you BUTTER BE! ayyoooo
Hello!!!!! right now costco eggs are pasture raised!
Thank you 🙏
Oh ya because you say it , that's what we should do. Keep your ideas to yourself and don't waste YouTube space.  Music is stupid too!!!
nuts contain "essential oils" that go rancid, seriously !! They take out oil " vegetables " this guys is full of >>>>>>
Its all processed, and bad for you.  See how that stops people from buying?  NOT!
And the guardian by the gates? Some middle aged man or woman?  Really???? Not nice!
All that for a rotisserie chicken that has some salt and sugar?  What will you say about the BBQ spare ribs?
why are you worried about chickens being cooped up in cages for your eggs when you eat chicken and bacon lol
Would it be ok to let each  person choose his own poison  . People don't care what YOU know, until they know you care. Also, never tell others about your problems, 80% don't care, and the other 20% are glad you have them.
Plz  is almond butter GMO ??
Dallas in the house
Canola oil is GMO. It's still cheaper to buy those big things of spices and waste them than 2 oz. of "regular" priced spices. The juices like the Pomm is not mostly water. Just because you're on keto doesn't mean to pass up good buys for folks who aren't keto. =p That olive oil is from a mixture from various countries.
I’m not Keto but this stuff is helpful.
Rotisserie chickens were raw chickens which reached their sell-by date. Cooking makes it legal to still sell them. If they aren’t organically-raised they will have additives in their food to help them grow and avoid infections from being in close quarters. He is also talking about humane conditions for them as well as additives. Did you people hear anything? He’s right on the money for those who care about quality, compassion   and health. If all one cares about is taste — go for it.
Don’t pay attention to some of the comments.
I love your shows, please keep doing them, I am learning a lot.
Coconut oil has a lot of cholesterol in it compared to other types of oils.
I eat that much Cumin but I love curry.
You rock!!  You are dead on it.  It Is a lot of trickery at the stores Costco, bJ's, trader Joe's whole foods.   I just signed up for the cornucopia institute. Thank you for putting together a well in form video. You are so right about the chicken and the eggs at Cosco  the chickens are in Normas and tasteless.  And the eggs are terrible.  When shopping at these places you really have to go in there with an educated eye.
Oh my goodness thanks so much for posting this will pay attention now when at Costco . I don’t buy that roasted chicken anymore as I get so sick every time I eat it. it’s horrible we have to be so careful in what we buy in the grocery store scary
Please loose that music it is so distracting
Yes the Keri gold is great!
Pretty sure that peanut butter has additives. I love the peanut butter at TJ’s that is just peanuts and salt. It’s addictive.  Btw, I’m middle-aged and so are you. What are you? Early 40s?
“Are you going to get through that much cumin in 6 months?” Clearly you don’t live in an Arab household :p
You could also not be a prick and let people buy whatever they want.
well seeing as how Costco gets its chicken from the same places you get your OTHER chickens, until they can start producing their own (which will be soon) all your other chickens? same thing as the ones you will pick up from the shelves.   and its 4.99 because they do the same thing as their hot dogs and soda combo for 1.50, they sell it at a LOSS because its one of the things to bring people in. they lose about 40 million dollars on chicken yearly.   costco is probably one of the last honest or close to honest companies you still have out there.
Asshol** what should we buy.....fuc**
You say "the bomb" way too much but otherwise, a lot of what you say I like and are products I use and what I've been moving towards using food wise. Making smarter decisions and making better life choices.
If someone was to buy eggs Fromm Cisco which one would you recommend. Thank you for your input on Cisco’s products and this was my first time watching you so Thank You  Again KJ
Thank you for info about the eggs.   Yeah, anything from China is no good.
Did he just walk pass security guard?
lol no
brown eggs are not necessarily organic eggs. They are just brown.
I love ❤️ Costco
Thank you .... helpful..... I'm so tired of the constant battle to eat healthy.....I grow my own micro greens & wheatgrass but you never quite know how good your oil is....
“When you can’t pronounce half the ingredients, that’s a bad thing.” Maybe you have a problem with pronouncing things... lol
excuse me sir the olive oil is very danger if you heat it or use as deep fry .. most US and Erup they dont know anything about olive oil it should no use for fry . i am very sure you never read about olive oil and when u start talk about olive oil i find out you just folow the details on cane or bottels but no any idea about knowldge . sorry my english not perfect but i am from olive oil family you cant use it for deep fry
LOL look at the negative comments. This happens when you mess up with people who love Costco. I am one of them, sadly I could not watch the rest of the video since what you said about the chicken did not make sense. Thank you for your effort.
Trader Joe's haul!!!!
Thank you, really enjoyed  your comments on  Costco! Shared with my family ! I want to subscribe to your channel , but not sure how to do it I also want to see your other videos how do I do that?
Can u make a sprouts haul?
We accidentally bought 5 pounds of paprika on Costco .com
Canola, olive and grapeseed oil doesn't fry at high temps like traditional vegetable oil does..
Thank you Bobby for sharing! I’ve learned a lot from your video!!! You are absolutely right, there is no point to pay for all the sugar, water, low quality organic food 👍👍👍
Used to buy the same bacon until I realized it has sodium nitrate. Super dangerous chemical!
I just found your youtube channel.  I LOVE it.  Please do more of these shopping trips!!  Really great!
No chicken in the US has added hormones. It’s been illegal since the sixties.
Where can I find the inorganic food? You know, made of metal....inorganic. Metal food. There must be some.
Great video, made alot of sense
High fat, high salt butter? No thanks! I don't want to have a stroke or heart attack!
Like fingers raking across a blackboard,I couldn't even finish the video! How did we ever live before he came along?lol!
The prices at my Costco in Austin, TX are so much higher! The exact same almond butter is almost double the price.
Give me a break. I’m still gunna eat that rotisserie chicken and eggs.
you are telling people lies about the chicken. you cannot add hormones to any poultry in AMERICA. that is law. just because you do not like it, stop telling people lies. some of these folks are just much of a fool like you, by not taking the time to study.
The eggs might be the most healthy quality in Costco but we don’t care at what cost. He is right about chicken kept in confined cages to only eat and lay eggs. Walmart has large organic CAGE FREE brown eggs. We also need to be considered for animals
https://www.bonappetit.com/story/pine-nut-mouth-syndrome  He's wrong about the pine nuts
there is nothing wrong with a Costco rotisserie chicken. This is absurd. It is perhaps too salty but it makes a great chicken soup and there is no greasy pan.
I need your help Bobby!! I got choosen foods avocado oil from Costco but it’s cold pressed and naturally refined. Is naturally refined not good? They don’t have extra virgin. Your advice will be greatly appreciated
I trust this guy. The things he said are almost spot on. Being vegan as a kid and now growing up to try diet like keto, paleo, and my yucateca diet lol, and not to mention my husband's Americana diet, I for one understand food. I dont eat stuff like hemp hearts too much and use almond flour, which i will try soon, but i do give it a go and I'm just simple as i eat what i can afford and stay as simple ingredients as i can. As of recent I eat mash potatoes instant, and mac n cheese from a box only because I have 6 children to raise and make 3 different meals per sitting sometimes because all my kids have different diets and eat very differently for medical reasons. Only my autistic son he is just picky like I was with the no meat thing. As a kid i wasn't allowed salt, some meats, cheese, milk from cow etc. I had sever asthma to this point of going blind and not walking from lack of oxygen to the brain and living like this for a month. Not all things all bad in small amounts. I was given horse steroids to keep alive and now i have diabetes from it and here i am still kicking and pushing. This guy is trying his best to keep us inform and stat away what you dont want.  Just get the chicken. One wont kill you or anything. The whole month I went blind I just ate crackers and 7 up okay. That's all I could take in without throwing up so, this is all informative with his perspective. Thanks everyone. Long post, but nothing we do in life is bullet proof. Trust me. It's like I was never breastfed or vegan. I'm 34 years old, fat, diabetic, with 6 kids, poor, and my poor husband works to keep it all together with his bad eating habits and is healthier then my children. Lol check that out!
When this guy brushed off the Kombucha, I knew he was a moron.
Total fat diet no way. If you shipped with me I'd be like go wait until the car .  Zero vitamins or plant foods you spend your day in bathroom no doubt. Plus all the fats keto your going to burn out your kidney's and get cancer.
POM is not sugar water. It is juice. It does have a high sugar content. Don't drink 8 ounces, have an ounce.
Dude you look at a healthy how can you  Anybody but food.. If I look like you I do everything the opposite of what you doing
My autistic kids need vitamins because he would not will not eat meats and alot of foods. So vitamin Ds and Omegas he has to supplement
Well there are other people who needs those VITAMINS ok? even they still eat healthy they still need those especially with people who have health issues. Unfortunately not all people are as healthy as you.
Wow, this guy is super unlikeable. How does he have any subscribers
Who the heck is this guy, spewing unsubstantiated nonsense and full of himself.
What a lot of BS!
These new religions are pretty dull...
I only buy roast chicken so cheap and yummy😋
He needs to not involve random people in his videos, because his food choices are so snobby, and they end up just making him look silly and rejected 😂
I always buy rotisserie chicken:  it  is  DELICIOUS. My  ADVICE  for   everybody:   EAT WHAT IS TASTY  NOT WHAT IS "HEALTHY"!!!   Georgy  from San Francisco.
Lmaooo at the food court👏🏼😂
Perfect video!  Can you add a video on how to figure out whats healthy at a family dollar style.
Sounds like you work for Whole Foods store so obviously you are at the wrong store!
He's right about one thing, "Certified Organic" is a total scam. 99% of the time you're buying the same stuff at 3 or 4 times the price. Whole Foods has been busted COUNTLESS times for lying about the quality of the stuff they sell. A few years ago, the 100% farm raised, organic, ridiculously overpriced fish they sold was actually bought from some prison is Colorado, raised by prisoners. Here: https://grist.org/business-technology/whole-foods-is-selling-you-fish-farmed-by-prisoners/ Please take a second and google it for yourself. Whole Foods is a scam.
Right out of the gate this guy is full of crap. If you buy those packages of chicken thighs at Costco, the thighs have just as much additives as the whole chicken. What a clown. It's like saying unrolled cigarettes are better for you then pre-rolled packs of cigarettes.
"hormones and chemicals being pumped into the chicken." That's a lie. NO producer even does that. It has been illegal to do that since the 1950's.
I thought he would mention about the milk. I was shocked to see refined fish oil as one of the ingredients in Kirkland milk. I'm a vegetarian and stopped buying milk from Costco. Next time you buy anything, check the ingredients.
Lll
What about frozen fruit? I buy them at Whole Foods $$
I bought almond butter last week--it was $12.!
When did bacon become healthy.
I went to Costco UK yesterday... I love going there! I'm glad I was able to find the avocado oil in glass bottle. All the rest is pretty much the same. 😉 going back there before xmass again!
Man, he is annoYIIIINGGGGGG!!!!
He acts like a total know it all. 🤢
Annoying and so condescending!
This guy makes me go 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Eggs are cage free eggs...says so on the label. Someone is lying....or wrong. Maybe different locations?
Wait I thought coconut oil was a bad fad?
Great video! Aldi would be wonderful for a future haul
Amazon! Great video, thank you!
Right on about the sugar content in those "juices" . Make your own with a juice extractor. Tastes so good and way healthier.
Hello! What do you think about organic fruit?
Kerry Gold butter is so good!
Why do we watch videos of people telling us how to shop?
Corn is GMO. How can those eggs be organic?
Ummmm pretty sure the peanut butter and probably almond butter is loaded with sugar.
I agree with the no on the eggs and rotisserie chicken.  Curious about those cage free eggs?   I don't but eggs because i have chickens. But curious
Here's a tip... Stop buying dead animals.
Costco is awful at organic foods.
Who are you? Do you really know what you are talking about??
When are you getting to the water aisle?
Typical left wing dick.  Ignore.
Thanks for the tip about storing nuts in the fridge and the ingredients that are in the rotisserie chicken.
He's wrong about the nuts at Costco.They are genetically modified.unless it says Organic don't purchase them. Costco sales organic cashews as far as nuts go
You are an arrogant, loud and obnoxious person...obviously deprived of any real affection as a child...probably raised by a domineering mother!
This dude is so ANNOYING! If he did the research on peanut butter he wouldn't eat it ether!🙄
Happy music helps the negativity go down
You totally skipped the frozen veggies and fruit! They're organic and sooo tasty.
What about the Cage Free eggs behind the Organic eggs in that Costco freezer?
What about the RX bars or Kirkland quest bar brand
#donteatlikeart :) I'd like to see an Aldi haul... and please tell me why expellor pressed is being recommended Vs cold pressed (for coconut oil at least) - I'd like to hear your thoughts. Thanks.
Organic is such a scam, and you're gullible for believing it.
Thank u very much and God bless you. I will watch out..next time if i go there
I wouldn’t buy any of the shit that he thinks is so good or nutritious.  Well, maybe the bacon.  And salted butter is a must.
I've had the pine nut mouth!! It's the worst.
What makes you such an expert about foods? Give me a brake.
Great haul very informative! Art😂😂
Don't buy anything from China!!!!! We are in a silent war with them and they want to destroy us from within!!!! Get it?!!!
I think the precooked bacon is a great deal. The Kirkland brand bacon is pumped full of water and the tremendous amount of fat that renders off to reveal shrunken slivers of bacon is obviously not worth the money spent. The Hormel precooked bacon on the other hand has none of these problems and is ready when you need it. Additionally, a pound of the Hormel lasts a long time and little to no grease to dispose of.
This guy is ignorant.  It's common knowledge that Costco Rotisserie chicken is a loss-leader; they've already determined that they'll never charge more than $5 for one, even if they lose money on it, and this guy is judging it on price alone.  He thinks Kerry Gold butter is so great, and it's very tasty, what he doesn't know is that it isn't even organic at that price.  He's a weak little soyboy that is trying to tell us how to eat? lol
Eggs ... I always get a brand called "happy eggs" . They're pasture raised and the yolks come out so dark.
This guy says don’t buy eggs and chicken but he recommends bacon?!! Which is literally fat... load of sh*t
This guy can not stop tripping over his hipsterness enough to not bash perfectly fine things.  "Who needs all this, no one needs all this!" *Proceeds to put it in cart*  I especially love when he bashes other hipsters.  Irony.
Seriously! People....take a breather. He is not God and everything he has mentioned are" in his opinion"  It was my first time on his channel and enjoyed it. I am much more interested in his recipes then his shopping.  Clearly his interest are for us to get healthier! It's your choice...Eat on
The definition of food. If it does not rot don't eat it. So eat food ,not a lot, mostly plants.
You're not healthy..read the China Study. Look up Dr. Sebi...get a clue before ranting that you know what health is
This guy is a spoiled baby.  He needs to spend some time in Africa.
Why is fully cooked bacon bad?
This fucking dude talking about happy eggs and rotisserie chicken. LOL
Yes, because buying a whole chicken, roasting it, then shredding it sounds so much easier and cheaper than buying a Costco rotisserie chicken😕
I'd have to ask this guy to leave my store if I worked there.   It's one thing to make a video giving out "information", but trying to dissuade actual shoppers is going a little to far.
Subtitles are atrocious.
Costco sells their  rotisserie chickens at a financial loss on the assumption you will buy other things. They achieve savings by owning their own farms and processing facilities that achieve vertical integration. Coconut oil is not medium chain length designer variety. Not that great for you
Aldi haul and do like this one, tell yays and Mays. Just found your channel and will subscribe. Interested in recipes too. Said on this vid too fast to follow but that works if you have recipes on another video.
Thank you. I learned alot about learning where things come from and now going to learn more about how to buy things based on where things are SUPPOSED to grow to avoid problems.  Thank You!!!!  Oh  one more thing...The FDA doesnt even regulate vitamins and we HAVE NO IDEA what is actually in the vitamins or whether their claims on what they do are truly accurate.
First of all, you’re shopping at Costco.   The biggest collection of ultimate land fill on the planet.
Your advocating using canola oil and rape seed oil..  Probably the worse oils EVER. Sorry dude that's a no no!
apparently art is the one who should be doing the costco buy/dont segment.  he knows whats up
IDK why I thought I would find this video helpful..
Well now I want Costco chicken! lol
Some people cannot swallow pills because of their gag reflex, little throat passage, or whatever other reason.  My Husband has this issue.  Adult Gummy Vitamins are not always a bad thing.  To each, their own...right?
The word "Pine Nuts" comes from Italy. But it does not mean it originally came from Italy.  Also, a lot of products come from China. Those products even include your underwears and socks. Just hold your tongue, plz.
This is very good  information..
Love it! But  I Could enjoy a non - whistling soundtrack more...
An Aldis video would be great.
That Kirkland brand pre-cooked bacon is delicious! There is not one thing negative about the taste or texture and it cooks in seconds with no mess or stress!
You are amass...
If you wanna label something a buy I suggest consistently labeling in green and a not buy in red
Those ingredients on the chicken are the seasonings,  which makes up a very small fraction of what you are eating.
Vitamin B12 is an important supplement for people who dont eat meat.
Ive never seen that type of flour in my local costco.. or any alternative to regular sugar
that bacon you like so well has a crap ton of sugar in it
The spices we get at Costco are of best quality, I can guaranty. Ask any Asian that big pack of Cumin won't for last more than 2 months.. also you need to store it in a airtight container. Also, you can never know how long the whole foods has stored the whole spices too.
It's been illegal to add hormones to animals in the US for decades.
Why does he come across so snobby?
Yeah.... I ate a rotisserie chicken from somewhere, a couple of times in desperation - too broke,lonnngg hours, no time to cook. I got a headache both times badd headache, felt a little sick, too.
The best thing about this video is Art! What a trip! You go Art! Don't drink the Koolaid!!!
this guy should go out hunt down a wild chicken ( no hormones ) let it die of old age ( do not cause it any pain ), dig up some wild roots ,flavor them with grass , render oil from self gathered pine nuts etc etc and not bother us with his mindless dribble
You’re not buying eggs or chicken but the pigs are also mistreated and slaughtered. None of the animal products you showed here are healthy.
Videos are too long!
This guy is a fucking idiot.
That whistling music in the background is sooo annoying.
I disagree on the oils. The most dangerous oils you can have in your diet are palm oil, followed by coconut oil. They both have high contents of LDL-which is the bad cholesterol that can build up in your arteries and eventually cause a heart attack. Now, a small amount of cholesterol is good for some bodily functions, but loading up on it via coconut oil can be detrimental in the long run. He best oil options are: canola, olive, sunflower, flaxseed and  a variety of vegetable oils. Read up and beware of what you are putting in your body. Disclaimer: (All things in moderation). You are all welcome.
The Clinton's have been lying so long that they actually believe in what they are saying they probably could pass a lie detector tests that's how much they actually believe in their lies
My mom had a terrible allergic reaction to Costco chicken. She is a purist in her eating habits so anything artificial or chemical shows up in her system.
I'm 64, a good cook, still healthy and attractive, and I find you pretty insufferable. I don't belong to Costco, I prefer to shop at my local grocers, and I can make my own decisions about what is good for me and my husband.
Luv ya babe well said well done from Costco Melbourne Australia
Hello  What if I told you that some king know your name and want to invite you to his palace ? What would you do ? You will be the happiest person in the earth .

One more thing You need to do some good deeds ,  and be the best version of your self every day . I really hope that you accept this message with love  Have a great and peaceful life guys . Translated from French to English.
Chicken is fine just salty,  which is a natural preservative and for flavor,  better  than cold cuts, eggs are healthy but not from happy chickens, afraid i can't afford ethical eggs, i wouldn't buy oil from plastic bottles,  also in moderation pom is good for you,  no sugar added except from the fruit, the green juice has no sugar virtually so he didn't read it,  kombucha makes me burp but also eases my digestion, agree European butter is better,  omega ratios,  grass fed cows. Some of us don't eat perfect like his buddy eating dog and pizza so supplements help., agree about half of what he said.
Why not the pre-cooked bacon?
Don't eat the Costco meatloaf. It's worse than any chicken
If we compare blood works now, I'd bet you that you'll lose.
How did he managed to video this without getting kicked out
Ugh...keigo...My Mom did NOT teach us keigo well and as such, I don't hear it well. *sigh*...need more practice
Asshole. Plain and simple, ladies and gents. Go get a real job, jackass.
The first example you chose exposes your ignorance.   Modified food starch, sugar and dextrose (essentially glucose)...is the seasoning. You're basically telling your audience to stop buying the chicken because it has seasoning on it. Only idiots claim that "something is bad if you can't pronounce it". If (5R)-[(1S)-1,2-Dihydroxyethyl]-3,4-dihydroxyfuran-2(5H)-one sounds like a horrible chemical....it's conveniently called Vitamin C for the uneducated. There is no basis for assuming toxicity based upon a man-made word for a substance.   If you did not text that chicken meat in a lab to check its hormone and antibiotic content, you have no basis for that claim either. You also have no idea whether a cooked rotisserie chicken...is actually from the same source as the uncooked chicken sold in bulk packs in the freezer/fridge area.
Gummy vitamins are for adult with digestive issues...dahhh
Loved this video.  Very informative.  Thank you for sharing this with all of us.
He's right about the eggs, Marketplace or somebody did a show and busted them. You can tell good organic eggs, the yolk is more orange.The chicken is too good to be true-beware...but for the price a hot ready tasty meal once in awhile! KerryGold butter and cheese is from pasture fed-best. Juice is just as bad as pop, unless fresh squeezed. Never buy vitamins from a drug store, only from a health store. There pharmacy dealings was caught in a scam as well on a national show too. he went by the organic canned soups, all good, easy open lids, no toxic  coatings in cans, and yes their coconut oil is the best deal ever, use in replacement of all butter/oil in every recipe for everything, all over the body, hair and even a great lube!
How do you feel about peanut oil?
You are full of shit mate.
That music has got to go...
DB
Weirdo...
Coconut oil is high in saturated fatty acids, and saturated fat has been linked to high cholesterol levels and heart disease. Come on... Olive oil has more "good fat," monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, than virgin coconut oil. Coconut oil is just a stupid fad.
Twig boy is full of shit 💩💩
I don't buy already rotisserie cooked chicken, or anything that's already made, I enjoy cooking everything I eat. But those rotisserie chickens people buy is because it's a quick meal..People come home late from work and they want something quick to eat..They don't have time roasting a chicken, and they think this already cooked chicken is better for them than eating say, Burger King, or whatnot. There are chemicals with everything we eat today..I don't truly believe everything on the label , even if it says 'Organic'..Just few years ago there was a whole big thing on Extra Virgin Olive Oil being not what it supposed to be..We all try and eat healthy, but some of us just can't afford the expensive stuff..And Costco is a good place to start and get a good value for our dollars...And I don't buy anything that is made in China that goes into my food supply and body...I read all the labels on the all the food packages, and beauty supplies as well..We can't be too careful these days with made in China crap!.
Very informative glad I found this!!!
"Costco rotisserie" - Costco intentionally lower it to that price. And they lose money every year on that, but it is a business strategy, coz it brings more ppl to their store. And once you in Costco you end up buy other things. No one will go all the pain just to get that chicken. You didn't do homework.
A lot of negative comments here, but I think you have to give Bobby credit.  I've watched thousands of YouTube videos over the years and Bobby managed to find the most annoying background 'music' I've ever heard on a video.  The whistling just repeats over and over.  Congrats Bobby!
I will still eat the chicken, I know it has more salt than should be consumed but if I am in a pinch it works.
I want a Costco Churro now and his breakfast sounds gross..
I’m disappointed in most nuts from Costco because they put them thru an homogenized process that causes them to lose their “crispness”. I don’t purchase them there anymore but if anyone learns they’ve stopped this, please let me know!!
Great Video!!
I get the feeling you are out of touch. Go back to your kind.
Im on a keto diet so some of this i get but i also LOVE the chicken. I wasnt that shocked about a couple things because there are things i already buy now but if your someone that likes to look up where your food comes from then i guess that works for you. I always thought costco was more health conscious so the thing about the juice not being good because it isnt fresh squeezed kinda surprised me.  I havent bought a chicken from there yet but would like to know that i COULD if i needed because i have kids and like a few others here have said, its hard to set aside time to make things from scratch or things that require too much time to prep. Having a toddler and an autistic 7 year old doesnt exactly leave you with alot of time. We get our dino buddies chicken nuggets from there, as well as lots of other things that are easy and fast so i hope those are better quality! i dont pay for a yearly membership so that i can buy shit food! lol!
lmao fuck this guy
Nice educational videos. I don't think the values of this video relies on whether or not we agree with these dudes. We are reminded that we can always get good stuff not at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's but places like Costco too. People nowadays are too obsessed with self image. Shop wisely and do not let the corporates fool you. Read the packaging. Do not be tricked by the marketing fluff. Good things can come from any where. Good video guys..
He kind of a jerk😕
something annoying about your preaching ---and that stupid music w/ whistling gets on my nerves
Costco eggs aren’t even close to being fresh ish. Wish I could use almond flour- it is goitrogenic and should be used in small amounts for those with hypothyroidism.
Appreciate the positive comments of what to buy, but the food shaming is not necessary.
that guy eating the pizza and hot dog is the only one living happy on this video...
What about sams club?
everybody dies eventually, enjoy what you enjoy, as far as you don't harm others, cause you encourage others to be shitty like and then you'll be harmed of it as well genius  yes...
Enjoyed shopping Costco with you, however background music became annoying.
it's funny how no one wants his advices, i was dying here  those people have old habits
it like an Ikea for food
Organic  is a joke if its grown ,made on this planet its not chem free  its not clean ..
sorry i go there just for the chicken so stop talking right now .lol
"OMG Dextrose! Hide your family!" It's sugar you nitwit. As is pointed out elsewhere in the comments, the ingredients you're scaremongering over in that chicken are simple and safe. You're spreading misinformation presented as fact.
Listen to him he knows his food
Pom is not sugar water.. ..that stuff is sooo tart with nothing added to it.. can't trust this :T
rotisserie chickens are the same price as walmart's and pick n save around here.
I just subscribed to your channel 👩🏻‍🌾
The background music put me off this video
Thanks!
lmao the lady with the eggs - she had a quick snap back for him  they're not the highest rated but they're the highest rated here at Costco. bam! lol
Can you do one on Trader Joe’s.  Thanks!
Everyone that believes what is on the package and Govt mandated law probably voted for Trump and if not I have some land for sale in Florida with a mountain view.
Best video ever on Cosco! Subscribed! Looking forward to checking out the website!
Anyone who doesn't understand the preciousness of the big bag of Pirates Booty - my kids go through a bag in no time and when we run out it is PANDEMONIUM.
I rotisserie cook the whole organic chicken from Costco on my grill with a spice rub (preferably from Penzey's) at 400 for one hour, and it is amazing!  Way better than a dried out pre-cooked chicken, way better than other grocery store's chicken, and not expensive. Thx for the video.  Learned some new things. All the haters in this thread must be those OBESE waddlers that take up the whole aisle at Costco, oblivious to anyone else trying to get around their inconsiderate fat asshes, and who also park themselves next to the free food with their carts sideways, again oblivious to anyone else around them trying to get by.
Costco subsidizes the cost of their chicken. You are right No. “They shouldn’t be this cheap” Costco just started their own chicken farm to help them keep their prices lower.
This is such a good program that made me subscribed to this channel. I have always wonder why these so called organics eggs never taste good...I tried to like them for the price and the label "organic", but my taste buds won't lie, those small pale yellow yolks won't lie, so I've already stopped buying them just based on instinct, now I know better :)
Enjoyed the vlog mate, I'm from england
Costco should put this guy in trouble. We love Costco
So basically your saying Brian shaw is wrong
You guys don’t realises how big are the pack foods in USA, everything is to big , to process ! Last time I been visiting first week I was craving for salad and healthy food !
Ok no but nothing , go there look around eat samples and don’t buy ! Simple like that that guys is to skinny don’t pass trustable world lol ! Hahahaha
Newsflash!   Starr, Pompei, And most popular brands of olive oil, are FAKE.   research it.
The chickens are so cheap to get people to come to Costco for a $5 chicken, and spend hundreds of dollars on other things. Not because they’re unhealthy.
I worked for Costco for 12yrs...how is this guy able to even film in the location...it's not a "pro" Costco video
Live u life we dont no enything please enjoy u self
dud my kids would not eat that crap, they eat salads and meats amd i cook with very natural foods, but i am know where as picky as you are.guess what that type of food is not available everywhere.
Older people have problems swallowing so many capsules and large pills, so they prefer gummies, and the sugar doesn't bother them!
FYI Canadian Costco has better eggs
This is the most inaccurate video I've seen in a long time, if you check his sources most of them are just random websites
Had me until you picked up the worst Oil in the entire world, ask your Dr.   Not worth being hip, if you're dead.
The guy's got some soulless eyes
Why does "to cheap to be good" only apply to the items you describe as unhealthy but the low priced "health foods" are a steal?
I wonder if Costco can sue him? 😂
For the butter the silver one is not salty.only the gold is salty
Roasting your own chicken thighs sounds good. However, how can you be sure that the chicken thighs aren't from CHICKENS that are pumped full of hormones, antibiotics, etc? If you are buying the organic chicken thighs, you pay like 50% or more.  Also, the "toxic" chemicals are pretty far down on the ingredient list. If you don't know how ingredient list works, I suggest you to research on it. Of course, who wouldn't want cage free organic free range chicken? But given the "toxic" chemicals are at the end of the ingredient list, I wouldn't pay too much attention because they are quite insignificant. On top of it, it isn't like you are inhaling 10 Costco chickens a day. Moderation is the key. If they were the top 5 items on the list, it would be a different story. If you want to pay more and spend time to cook your chicken, more power to you. But paying $4.99 for a whole large cooked delicious chicken is a pretty good deal. If I may say, you wouldn't find that anywhere else in town. More than often, you pay more for a smaller less tasty cooked chicken.   As for the eggs, did anybody else see that the Kirkland CAGE FREE eggs are right next to the organic ones? The sign says $3.29 for the cage free eggs? That's a pretty good deal for 2 dozens. There is your good deal for happy eggs.   It is quite easy to make your own kombucha and it costs a lot less. You just have to acquire the scoby. There are different scobys for black tea and green tea.  Good job on pointing out the almond butter and almond flour.    I travel across the country often and always visit Costco warehouses along the way. Some items do have different brands as well as kind of items. For example, Costco in the Silicon Valley has significantly different items than one in Mobile, AL. I have also been lucky enough to shop at the Costco in Korea. They have mostly seafood and Bibigo items.
The "brown organic eggs" we buy from our Costco state that they are Pasture-Raised, which means that each hen gets at least 108 square feet to herself. That's better than Free-range which are allotted only 2 square feet and Cage-free less than 1.
Your talking about chemicals in your foods, low rated eggs and your mentioning bacon which is from pigs that are not treated any better than the chickens you spoke of. #plantbased
A very bad company who lays off their career managers because they don't want to pay benefits. I know two people they've done this to who both had to walk away from their mortgages. They devoted at least twenty yrs to this company only to be told they had to go. I do not support Costco at all!!!!
Lost me at the avoid chicken...
great info!  thanks...only one problem for me...lose the annoying whistling music!
At 6:00 what's he calling that stuff?  Inintelligable.  And he moves the bag around so much I can't read it.  Cinematography:  C-.
I go to Costco for one thing, and ONE THING only:  the rotisserie chicken.  For 4.99 (plus the $60 dollar membership, divided by the number of them you buy in a year - no, not cheap!) its still the biggest bargain anywhere.  Utterly delicious and juicy, and I easily get 4 meals out of one.  Me and the old Jewish ladies crowd around when they're ready to unload a batch.  Otherwise Costco is a ripoff.
I'd love to see Trader Joe's haul
Anyone who thinks cheap stuff must be bad for you is a bad influence. Dude, normal unprivileged people cant even afford the stuff you are saying is bad. Get your head out of your ass and open your eyes. YOU are the reason people cant afford decent food.
Talks crap about the canola oil, but talks good about the crap extra virgin olive oil(EVOO). If the EVOO doesn't have the cold pressed date it's your low grade stuff, Costco does btw sell the good EVOO in the smaller 1L glass bottles
Is anyone else concerned with the frequency that this guy mentions “keto”? He’s definitely not a food scientist.
This guy doesnt know eggs.
Art looks healthier eating the pizza than the other guy talking about his keto diet.
"omg dont buy these eggs these arent from happy chickens, pay the more expensive price at whole foods" *buys cheap bacon just cause its yummy and makes no consideration to the quality of lives of the pigs* this guy contradicts himself and has no idea what hes talking about. btw no one going grocery shopping wants to have to muscle past some loser telling them not to buy a certain product lol fuck off
Man eating a rotisserie chicken once a month or so ain't gonna kill you.... you should be more worried about all the radiation from cell phones going thru your head... I'd say stock up on their aluminum foil and make a helmet to wear around at all times!😂😂😂👽👽👽 just kidding you're probably right I just do the best I can with the budget I'm on... but I do enjoy a rotisserie chicken occasionally 🍗🍗🍗🍗
Almonds and peanuts have lots of toxins in them if they are not organic. They get sprayed a lot. Also, just because Kombucha makes someone gassy, it doesn't make it a bad product for everyone else.
This guy makes me so angry. Organic eggs at Costco aren't the best but the Kerrygold is the worst butter if you're trying to lose weight. Plus, why in the world is he just saying things like "You shouldn't get these eggs, they are bad for you, don't get rotisserie chicken, a place rate these eggs a 1 out of 10 stars" I mean come on!
You’re an idiot, Costco chickens are just fine.
Love the video but please don't use the whistling music in the background. No music would be best to focus on what you are saying. Thanks.
I'm sure this person can tell you the best kind of soy to buy.
Bet that bacon is really "healthy"....that chick is such a douche.
Take a chill pill.
Nice tips for the vegan portion of the video!
Hilarious how he thinks he'll be able to change ppl's minds about buying the eggs by yapping at them about how low they are apparently ranked. If I ever encountered someone like that, I would be nothing but annoyed and irritated by his judgy tone.
People buy rotisserie chickens because they don't have TIME to cook a damn chicken!
I read in a book that canola oil was not even meant for human consumption.  Very good video!!!  I love Costco, and this was a very good overview of some products.
So wait... he cares about the life quality of the chickens... but he still eats meat?   -__-
Very nice...
Why buy nut butter when it's so easy to make? It's fresher and you know the ingredients. Just the same as the chicken :)
Damnit, we LIVE off those eggs.  =(  We don't get much from Costco outside of these eggs and  few other items you mentioned (butter, coconut oil, olive oil, etc) but man I'm bummed about those eggs.
"These chickens are sad and stuck in a cage" literally says cage free on the box 😂
Great info! I’m doing an anti-inflammatory diet. Going to check out your recipes.
Some good advice, however Costco chickens are the best.
Thanks a bunch!!!!👌🏾😊
TOO LONG VIDEO MONGO LIEK SHORT VIDEO NEED WATCH IN TIME IT TAKE TO POOP
There is so much false information here. Not everything, of course. But a whole lot.  I really want links to your published studies you figure out this information from. Because I've read a ton of trendy articles too- which reference to out of context studies.
lame.
My dogs love Costco roast chicken. We buy a chicken every week and add some to their regular food and give them some as a treat at night. Separating the meat from the skin, bones, etc. is the only annoying part. Gotta do it when it's still warm to make the task much easier.  One thing I will stay away from is the packaged, separated chicken meat they sell. I bought a package once when they had their ovens down for cleaning. It didn't feel right, smell right, or taste right. It wasn't rotten, but it just didn't seem like real chicken.
Actually, I believe what he said.  I don't trust Costco because a lot of things that sell from Costco are GMO products.
so I always get my organic frozen vegetables from here like broccoli, green beans and mixed veggies. I was hoping he would touch on that but even if its aswered in a the comments, I'll take it ;)
Just wondering what one would do with a little two ounce bottle of chili powder or cumin.  Pour two of each in a big pot of chili?
Dude walked right past that baking cocoa which is bodacious!  I would never buy spices in that large amount; I am very fortunate to have 3 stores with bulk spices; measure out what you need and save tons of money plus they will be much fresher and stay that way.  (Sprouts, WINCO and Central Market). I buy the huge bag of walnuts, I bake with them, we put them in cereal, salads, crunch them as a snack.  If I have a need for mass quantities of pecans I'll get that too.  I also buy the huge bag of chocolate chips Kirkland brand if they are there.  I do not consider anything a pantry item if it needs refrigeration - regarding butter, I get the Kirkland unsalted which is in the long packages and has the short sticks.  It is fabulous for baking.  I bake a lot so these items are great!  If I know I'll need them I will get a big tray of eggs but I can find them for less other places  I might grab some Kerrygold for a fancy dinner to eat on hot bread....but never that much.   (I am assuming he was in a cold room for dairy and eggs. I sure hope so!  My Costco has sliding door freestanding places for those things. )  We buy Dave's Killer bread 21 seeds at a good savings and a hot/sweet pickle that we love.  I have the perfect Tupperware pickle box which will hold the whole jar.         Things I never buy anywhere else:   Kirkland canned chicken breast.  I use it to make soup, chicken and dumplings, enchiladas, chicken salad  and any other recipe calling for shredded cooked chicken breast.  Black Beans.  Diced tomatoes.  Ro-Tel tomatoes and chiles (I live in Texas; it is ubiquitous) Chicken broth, mushrooms.  ( I make an easy soup which my husband named Pantry Soup. 1 can each: chicken with all the broth, chicken broth, Ro-Tel, black beans (rinsed and drained) .  I add chili powder, cumin and either cayenne or Yucateca Habanero sauce.  After it cooks a bit to blend the flavors, I add a whopping handful of frozen corn.  If I have any in the freezer a small amount of frozen leftover rice.  When these things are thawed it's ready to serve.  4 large servings.  Not nearly as salty as you would think either. )  Kirkland Black Forest Ham is great but we can't use it up without freezing it; goat cheese is a real bargain!    Another thing I like to have around are the chicken breast in the vaccum packs.  Two per section; cut the sections up and drop into the freezer.  So convenient and money saving too)
"Is this where you get your Avacado Oil?" Wanker.
This is not helpful what so ever..this guy is so pretentious.
Why do people think that brown eggs are organic and white eggs are not? The color of the eggs is totally dependent on the breed of chicken that lays it.
Just what the hell is with the background whistling/music???
You can't pronounce "kombucha.".  The "cha" should be accented, kombu-CHA...it means "tea" in Chinese.  And "kombu" is a sea vegetable.
He actually is correct about one thing:  the brown egg chickens are living in hell.  You can find videos taken secretly on YouTube, and see for yourself... but be prepared, it's graphic and upsetting.
You're way too fashionable.  Those rotisserie chickens are loss leaders, Costco will never raise  the price because it's a customer draw, and they're no more toxic than the raw chicken they sell.  But I'm vegetarian and don't have a horse in that race.  What's pissing me off is that they've been discontinuing foods and produce I love over last two years, while they raise their membership fee, and once I resorted to getting the items st Walmart, I discovered Costco didn't have the cheapest prices.  But now I have to pay two dollars more per unit for Tillamook Pepperjack cheese at Walmart, it's popular but they got rid of it.  They discontinued ramen noodle soup, and I found out Walmart is cheaper on that too.  Also Nabisco honey grahams are the same price at WM.They discontinued traditional reduced moisture balls of mozzarella and now only sell preshredded cheap fake mozzarella that is mixed with anti fungal and anti caking agents.    And they've removed the red be chmthaf us disabled people need, to sit on and wait until a scooter becomes available.  They told me I could just sit outside on the filth,  hard cement ledge, where people smoke and spill beverages, where it's hot and dusty in the summer, and bitter cold in the winter.
load off bollocks to be honet.
To be fair adult gummies can be used by older people who cannot swallow larger pills. I have seen it in the pharmacy when I use to be a pharm. tech.
morons keep buying eggs from caged chickens. This is horrific!!!!!!
What’s wrong with the pine nuts from China? We have 16K square miles Pine tree forests existing for hundred of years in the north of China, and they grow the really high quality pine nuts. I know what the pine nuts taste like. Not only the foods from Europe are good. If you have a bias to Chinese product, stop using anything made in China. Please , don’t use them. Fair?
Oh, shut the fuck up. Those chickens are amazing and 4.99 is my budget
Why didn't you tell us about all the garage in that bacon? sugar, dextrose, nitrates, nitrites, phosphorus and so on?
Art is hilarious I did not see that happening! Take Care
Lol you shouldn’t buy cooked chicken you should buy uncooked chicken and cook it! You don’t say! You shouldn’t buy unhappy eggs for less you should buy happier eggs for more! I am really into getting Best Buys... bulk spices loose flavor quickly so you bulk buy oil that goes rancid. Yeah spices last longer than oil. Good shout out on healthy seeds and vegan yogurt... carry on sir :)
I cannot believe some of these comments. People, this is just one guys' opinion.  You can buy what ever you want. He is solely sharing his thoughts on items at Costco. Grow up!
lol I normally dont comment on videos, but this guy is ridiculous lol.... does he not realize that big families and businesses shop here to save money and have things because they need them "nobody needs this much of this". not if you are buying for yourself you sad little food snob lol......worst channel ever
LOL, I'd like to see you go on nothing but $25.00 a week. I can't afford to buy in bulk or for the membership. I like WinCo better.
Lost me at the chicken.
12:20 do you have a recipe video for that? It sounds delicious??!
To remove the salt from the slated butter, soak it in water. That was a trick my mom used to do.
There is a lot of inconsistency in this video, how do we know the bacon comes from high quality pork? Recommend expensive butter for higher fat, 5 times more expensive oils than what people been cooking with for decades, pine nuts from Italy but not china, he seems to be influenced by marketing fads, do not trust him.
This guy is trying to give everyone his own food issues.
Wow this guy is sharing some wisdom!, it is unbelievable to see the huge packages they sell over there, do you really eat in industrialised quantities? processed food is bad for us, massa production of processed food is terrible for all of us, the planet. I am glad some people are starting to wake up and plant their own vegetables or just eat less processed foods every time and choose more natural, we can all contribute, every bit counts. In Peru we are running out of quinua (Quinoa) mainly due to export, I guess it is the price of globalisation, bad regulations and a consumer that is a zombie and does not realize where the most important thing comes from, his food
"Chemicals" {eyeroll}
People, I love Bobby and I just ran across his video.  Do not ever buy salted butter unless you are cooking for yourself.  Your guests will be much happier.  Home cooks, you should care more about your friends rather than saving a dollar.  Bobby, please give better advice when it comes to cooking.  Thanks, Brad
"Must by organic, free range happy eggs" buys factory farmed, cruelty-laden bacon. Weird flex, but ok
what about all the palm oil in the peanut butter.
he is saying the truth
Costco loses money on the rotisserie chicken -- that's why it's so cheap.  It's a loss leader for them.  This guy is an idiot.
Sorry but people will find out that the Me to diet is ruining their heart..
Some of us can't afford to pay more for a roaster chicken and then cook it at home (figure in the cost of the electric or gas for the oven).  Throw me some $ and then I could shop at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's)
The $5 chicken is ok, but I can broil a homeless person for free.
lmaoooo i'm not gonna have this soy boy tell me not to buy rotisserie chicken and eggs at costco
This was great info and fun! Not boring and kept me interested. But I had to mute it use closed captioning. That friggin whistle in the song gave me a headache.  But info seemed honest and unbiased. Good stuff.  And I really really hate that song.
I'm allergic to coconut. What would you recommend as an alternative?
What an annoying, ignorant ass
Fix the signs you knock around, you damn heathen.
First of all, being scrawny means you are not at all someone who should be listened to. Second, keto is very bad for you. Third, his anti salt, pro ‘organic’ opinion is idiotic.
Omg I love Art. I want that pizza too!
So would the cage free eggs at Costco be good? Or would u have to go to Whole Foods to get the vital eggs?
I'm on the Keto Diet.  Love what you said about the right kind of Butter to buy, and the right kind of Oil.  Have you got a site you'd recommend with more stuff to do with Keto?
This is the moment that I wished youtube would have that block button so I wouldn't have to see anything from this guy ever in this site...
Holy Crap......I ate the chicken!!!! H.....elp!!!!  ;-)
Most chicken (beef/pork/etc) is pumped full of preservatives, chemicals and hormones so buying one yourself and making it is no different. LOL
This was amazing !!! Thank you 🙏🏼
He says the chicken is pumped with preservatives, but the sign clearly states that it has none. How does he know that no chicken can be that price? This guy is a tool and I don't want to finish the video.
There are adults who struggle to swallow things like pills. Adult vitamins that are gummies,  are actually a good thing. If you don't suffer from dysphagia - I'd suggest you probably not bash it. =)
Tho i don't think you deserve that much hate from the comment. You did made some less educated claims, but you are not a nutritionist.
I really liked how much detail you provided, I see a lot of videos that just use “sources say” with no explanation , I appreciate your research and reasoning!
Great video!
when you can't pronounce half the ingredients, its bad -- classic naturalistic fallacy haha.
Holly what kind of pizza is that. That looks so big compare to one I get from Costco in Canada
This feels like an episode of Portlandia!
haha going for that gangsta shake with the black girl @ 1:35, you racist douche
The '90s called - they want the expression, "the bomb" back for their museum ... do you mind?
This is the most pretentious video I've seen in a long time. Nothing says middle class snob like telling people not to buy avocado oil that isn't "cold pressed". Seriously, I want to punch through my screen with the hope that it connects with your face.
Assuming that Costco’s rotisserie chicken is bad just because it’s cheap it’s like denying all the samples because they’re free.
Some people need vitamins like post menopausal wemon often need extra calcium, which are a great price at Costco
Which costco in chicago is this?
Probably one of the biggest things to avoid at Costco was the last thing Art was eating. That stuff is the most chemical laden and preserved food in the store. And recently Costco announced that they were going to fix that. Will see if they follow through???
Love Cosco’s rotisserie chicken and I don’t trust you.
Is that the one on Elston ???
You're an idiot!!!
Hey Matt -  I'm interested in low priced stocking stuffers
eggs--the bird farms kill the male babies..you can see them killed, here on yt.
Don't be someone who shames.  Shame on you.
Haha as a worker at Costco who worked in the rotisserie department I can tell you the chicken is the same as the uncooked in the fridge. Costco actually looses money on many of its ready to eat foods, but they make it up on the memberships that’s why they have memberships, so they can take a hit on items.
WOW. Just wow. What a self absorbed completely out of touch douche.
What happened to the audio quality throughout the video?
I'm switching to six different items you spoke about, I also like the ending of this video😉
What a trendy ill informed asshole, move on nothing here!
I have learned not to listen to someone who just talks claims about effects of different foods without offering supportive evidence. It's sad to see that these people have replaced the scientists as food experts for illiterate people.
LOL this guy likely will die of heart attack at 53.... since he's so deprived of life goodness.... probably beats his wife for leaving dirty dishes.
Thank you, but you need to learn about the genetic modification process before coming across as a health educator.
Omg he is bashing everything we buy and use!
if you are not a cheap ass, why you go to Costco? lol
Ok., here’s what I think.  He’s accurate on most everything.  Costco used to carry organic nuts.  They no longer do here in Florida.  He recommended the nuts but they are not organic.  Nuts are sprayed with various chemicals, so I personally would not purchase them if you are concerned about consuming pesticides.  Re: vitamins.  He’s accurate.  There are Honda’s and Mercedes.  Which would you prefer?  If you are buying vitamins with toxic ingredients in them, you are wasting your money.  Research top organic food based vitamin companies and go with those.  Thorne is good.  Garden of Life, MegaFood, etc.  Do your homework.  High quality vitamins saved my life.  I don’t agree, ever, with people telling others not to take them.  Certain health conditions can only be remediated, “healed” with supplementation.  Toxic chemical exposures, pharmaceuticals, poor diet are things that can require a person to supplement.  Research “drug muggers”.  You will understand then.  Taking certain pharmaceuticals literally rob the body of certain vitamins.  These must be put back into the body or you set yourself up for some health issues.  He means well, people.  Every person must do what is right for them while keeping an open mind to do better... God bless.
at first i was like aww he’s adorable and then as the video continued the advice and suggestions were just... so wrong and so unhealthy no.
It's nice to know that the products I buy are the ones that you chose also verifying
Did this guy say the chicken is not a good deal??  BOY BYE!
The peanut butter is not good for you if it has hydrogenated vegetable oil.  Kroger makes an all natural with only two ingredient peanut butter.  Good stuff!😁  All rotisserie chickens are pumped full of salt and other unhealthy ingredients.
WHOLE FOODS SELLS ORGANIC BANANAS FOR $0.25 EA, LOL
This is the most pretentious thing I've seen in a while.
The chicken is a loss leader to get you all the way into the store....
WOW! I'm shook about that rotisserie chicken.
Cant afford Costco.... cant afford food! :(
How can you possibly think bacon is healthy??? You should research that.
To be fair the adult vitamin gummies are really for old elderly people who cannot exercise or may not be able to eat certain foods.
Do a what to and not to buy from Wholefoods.
Pooh poohs all over rotisserie chicken then highly recommends bacon - a Group 1 Carcinogen per World Health Organization.  🤣 Ain't anybody with half a brain gonna trust this fool's advice.
Bobby seems like a nice guy, and well-intentioned as all get out. But if you do all your shopping at Costco, Whole foods and/or Trader Joe's, then you either are spending too much of your hard-earned money on yuppy, (aka hipster) chow, or you're trying too hard to eat healthy.   Look, it's not that hard. In a grocery store, any grocery store, shop the periphery. Stay out of the aisles. Eat whole foods, (aka real foods). 80% of food in all food stores is processed, and processed foods contain preservatives and added sugar. The amount of sugar, regardless of form, that you need to survive is equal to goose-egg. Zero. Zip, None. Nada. The same is true for carbohydrates that aren't sugar, (starches). If all you ate was either protein of fat you'd get by just fine. If that statement wasn't true, there'd be no Inuits, (aka Eskimos). They've lived eons without carbs, (sugar or starch), and did just fine.   You want "clean food"? Grow your own or buy directly from someone who grows it. Farm to table. No middleman. The only reason to have "prepared foods" in your house is as insurance against hard times. You own that stuff with long shelf life for the days, (should they come), that going to the farm where you shop isn't an option. Think of what that looks like. Flood, hurricane, earthquake, civil unrest, whatever. They won't last forever, but having the option to NOT leave your house at such times may be the smartest prep you can do.   Be ready, be wise, be healthy, be safe. Walk in Peace. Right wrongs no one. Live long and prosper.
just found you by accident. You are all over the place. The title is misleading since it says you are showing healty items at Costco but you are showing bad moves to make. You should have made  2 videos. I can' follow this.  Bad move.........
Thanks for the video! I recently checked out Costco for the first time and was disappointed that they had basically no high quality meats. Ah well. Totally agree with you on the eggs. Vital farms butter and eggs are a staple in this house!
Yaaay Polyethylene!!!
Don’t agree with you, SORRY!!
Happy Eggs??!?!??! Hahahahaha. What a joke!
Really interesting video, but after 12 minutes I couldn’t take the whistling background music any more.
' plan going to the costco store... be good healthly / longer life / wiser... not important and keep avoid on the lists... 1- alocohlics / beers 1- cigars 1- ccooffees 1- fatty / greaseey / oilly foods 1- sugar sweety / salty foods
@FlavCity with Bobby Parrish  CHICKEN  IS A LOSS LEADER    THATS  WHY IS SO  CHEEP  .
The rotisserie chickens are their best seller I'm surprised this dude didn't get kicked out for this. yeah it's probably healthier to cook your own chicken thighs or whatever, but when it's 6pm on a Wednesday and you've got shit to do and you're on the way home from work, it sounds a lot better than McDonald's to go get a rotisserie chicken from Costco.
Poor video and poor taste
There's really no proof for much of what he is saying.  The roast chicken is actually a loss leader for Costco, they aren't making much money on them, it is to get you in the store.  The spice advice is silly for example I use spices that are more than 6 months old and they are still fine, in fact potency is fine for a decade out in my experience.  The way canola oil is processed is really not an issue, my concern is buying that much oil is that the oils can go rancid before you can use it all up.  Comparing food to whole foods is an absurdity, whole foods sells you eco-cred at top dollar...you shouldn't be going to whole foods if you're concerned about value.  Organic is a waste of money as the taste and nutrition is the same.  I especially like the douche aisle with the quinoa and the hemp hearts, just as wasteful as the (correctly called) supplement aisle.
Fuk this pompous shit stick.
This dude: Now you don't want to buy rotisserie chickens here because they're gross The chicken lady behind the counter that's well within earshot: ಠ_ಠ
3:22
Does anyone know why  my bags expand when I freeze nuts, walnuts, pine nuts etc.They look like small blown up balloons.
We Love Art! A Coke, a slice of pizza, and a hotdog. It's a cheat day:) I love it! I had learned to eat organic and choose my food wisely. The benefits of eating very healthy are outstanding. Thanks for the tips.
> Talks about health > Mentions the keto diet like it's actually healthy for people No, man. Just no. Keto is terrible for anyone actually looking to eat right or lose weight.
I don't care what you say....if it was not for the chicken, I probably would not go to Costco....well that's not true, but it is still one of the things I always get when I am there
You can get all sorts of Pine Nuts in the hills around Virginia City NV. Close to Reno NV.
Art with his pizza and hot dog!  Lmao!
Great tips! I also would like to add that you should look into European deli's and buy Sunflower oil(it's so much better than canola or soybean oil) and it goes for $2.99 for 32 oz bottle. Also Aldi has great prices and sales on irish butter $2.49 for 1/2 pound and than on sale it goes for $1.99
News flash, Costco sells a number of items at below cost to bring in business, including Tires. Rotisserie chicken being "too cheap to be good" is just a stupid attitude to have.
Christmas cakes
I'll bet Costco appreciated the hell out of this.
You are not clear in some of the items whether they are good or bad. It's confusing
Almond flour is calorie dense, also processed to the point it loses a lot of its nutrients.  Almond butter is very calorie dense. Coconut, olive oils and coconut milk are calorie dense, high saturated fats and are refined processed foods, heart attack inducing foods.
Very nice, what do you think about the baby spinach
this guy doesn't know much . Ill informed guy
I do not agree on the bulk spices.  I buy mine from Frontier Organic by the pound and freeze them and they are amazing and always on hand plus they are non-irradiated.  The Thai Coconut is gross, they add the gum to hide the fact that their actual fat content is way less than other organic and natural brands.  Typically in any can there is about 1/3-1/2 of the actual fat than should be in the can.
Peanut butter not good for you.  Pistachio butter is great.
Amen on Eggs !
This guy misleading people.
190 calories per bar???? No way
If you want to buy good quality flaxseed for very very cheap go to an animal feed store for horses and buy a 50 pound bag for around $20. Because it's not ground you can keep it outside but bring in what you want to bring into grind up and then use only that amount that day if you do need to save what you have ground up you can put it in the refrigerator but I think only for a day.
Anyone who pushes coconut oil has no credibility in bashing veg oil for using a "chemical process". Digestion is a "chemical process" too!
FUCKING JACKASS WEASEL
What’s up with your store still rocking the old-style carts?
I like a big tub of dish washer tablets. Not having to think about that for months - winning! Also, fully cooked bacon is the bomb. 60 seconds in the microwave and no mess!
What a waste of time.  This guy is NOT COOL.
"Nut butters are a must buy at Costco.  I'm on team creamy."  I can't be the only one who laughed like Beavis and Butthead at that.
Middle aged man or woman at the door? Hrmph.......... At our costco it’s any employee dude
Yeah right. All this stuff is waaaay too cheap. You wanna at least pay tripple the price for anything just so you can feel more entiltled and priviliged. Dude needs a serious reality check. Most people who go to Costco have money to burn!!
Do me a favor, take a trip to this magical place where your fav organic eggs are from. I would like to see such a place with these free roaming, happy chickens. I Don’t believe this exists.
Just trying to get income from views Another one of these rich Keto diet rich white guys who is turnoff! Thick cut bacon  and organic eggs, not a purist!
I prefer my coconut oil in a glass jar to more easily melt it in the jar in boiling water, then pour out amount needed. We're new to Costco, so really appreciate the tips. Thanks!
How Chia seeds will affect your health? ask Dr.Gundry , too. I had Chia seeds and I got bloated.
@BobbyParrish, ever heard of the pink lagoons of smithfield hog production. If you have not heard of them, youtube it. there is footage of a drone flying over one. Enjoy your bacon.
I don't trust nutrition advice from anyone promoting high saturated fat foods like butter, bacon, and coconut oil. It's pretty well accepted among dieticians that saturated fat raises cholesterol levels. There is no good reason to do restrictive diets like keto. People love to demonize carbs. But carbs aren't the enemy. Glucose is our body's primary fuel source. Which we can obtain from starch. Whole high starch foods like grains, and beans are very healthy. Healthy diets don't have to be restrictive.
First time viewing this guy's content. First impression was him saying this at 0:11, Seemed pretentious to assume, especially if you have grey hair and wrinkles. Besides I've had early 20's greeters as the guardians of the gates at my Costco. Literally chuckled at 5:02 when he talks right over that woman and walks off eating his free sample. Later at 5:54, I was so confused, nobody needs this, nobody needs pirate booty, booty is a good thing (high pitch "ha ha") , nobody needs this much booty, puts the booty in his cart. WHAT ? later goes on to bash multivitamins? I had to finish this vod, but it was pretty grueling. Youtube has to work on their algorithm for suggestive content.
Isnt free range and organic 2 diff things though?
I don't like you.
This guy must be a democrat.
The egg information was a very good thing to point out👍.
Ok, I liked your video until you knocked on the Kombucha!  I've been a student of nutrition for about 24 years.  While some brands of Kombucha have more sugar than necessary(it's never actually alot), the majority of them do not, certainly not the Gingerade that you passed in the video!  Kombucha is loaded with nutrients that contribute to healthy gut  flora, balance body ph and reduce inflammation!  If it makes you gassy, your gut flora may be imbalanced and Kombucha is helping you detox.  It is quite possibly the most AMAZING nutritious beverage anyone can drink!!  There is nothing nothing more nutritious for you at Costco than Kombucha🌱!
The people working on making the chickens must be like "hey buddy do u mind moving it on down" damn
Thank you so much for these suggestions. I absolutely agree with you on roasting a chicken yourself. It is worth the time and effort. I will look up your chicken salad recipe.
Do brown eggs taste different to white eggs?
Typical Upscale, Self Indulgent, CostCo Shopper. I worked one month for CostCo, having been a customer for 27 yrs. In the first 5 mins on the floor it was clear an employee should have no expectation of privacy. Further, all new temporary employees are hazed by management. I took issue with my treatment and quit. I thought I would pursue the matter, but when I realized the entire organization agreed with the practice I dropped the case and haven't been a member for the past four years. CostCo's successful business model relies on compliant Associates by hazing new hires and dumping 3 of 4 hired as Holiday help. Corp's hazing of new hires shouldn't be legal. Once it begins it spreads through all Depts. I can't advise Members enough to beware of the practice and put an end to it.
Did you go to acting school
@12:20 You are more ODC than Sheldon Cooper.    (yes, intentional)
Good content thanks
We don’t all have the luxury of spending hours a day making keto crackers and flax seed and sadness “energy balls”
thats why it's only $4.99
From what I heard Costco gets free whole chickens from Foster Farms  Since they buy  lot  chicken parts.
Pine nuts don't just come from Italy, heard of Russia, you moron?
Thanks for this video!
Yea, read onto it, Canola oil is healthy, healthier than that almond sawdust you bought two packs worth
Don’t shop Costco but Sams club are totally the same
I am sure those happy pigs just ran around the happy farm before they became the healthy bacon you are recommending.
bruh, that Costco rotisserie chicken is life.
hey creepy guy, get out of people's way, they are trying to shop, no one cares about the things you prefer, not everyone lives in your fruitcake world
crap i eat that chicken literally every day lol it's my fav thing from costco
You're a snotty arrogant bitch. Your opinions are irrelevant and not true. Bye Felicia thumbs down
Coconut oil is bad for you.
If kombucha makes you gassy, it means you're not eating/drinking enough probiotic foods.
This lady is annoying.
Why would you pick up a protein bar that doesn't advertise itself as being "Healthy" and then start tearing it apart verbally? It's like picking up a box of Smarties and talking about how it isn't healthy. It just comes off as you looking for things to bitch about, it's pretentious and not informative or helpful at all.
fuck price
Nitrate free bacon buddy - and don’t follow a Keto diet
I'm with you Are😋😉
Oh that Kerrygold butter is the very best.
"adults should not be eating gummies" MAN IF YOU DONT STFU AND LEMME EAT MY GUMMY VITAMINS
What a pretentious judgemental prick! Dislike
I look to see if anything contains Citric Acid because it is a preservative made  in a lab from the black mold of rotting onions. Nobody is sitting around squeezing lemon  juice into to it! If it has lemon extract it will say so and sometimes you will see where it also says Citric Acid. This is cheaper and made into a powder.  I discovered it causes skin problems and people do not know that.  If I dare use it, I will get eczema  or vaginal burning.  I estimate it is in 80% of all packaged foods. I found in a brand of health tea. I contacted the tea company and they said I was correct and they just found that out and are no longer using it. Even companies that say their product has no preservatives will contain Citric acid which is a preservative.  JanieMartinSings
Of course we go through that much cumin...we’re Moroccan Berbers❣️
Where are you from!
This guy sounds as if he might be a spy for Sam's Club!  There is NO comparison between the two warehouse stores.  Costco is GREAT, and they also treat their employees like human beings, unlike Sams/Walmart, who treat their people like serfs.
Does Costco allow people to film inside?
I stopped watching when it came to the bacon.  Total food snob.  He's willing to spend more money for eggs, but not for almond flour.
who is this bozo?
There are no hormones in Costco rotisserie chickens that is against federal law.
Costco should have the sheriff remove you.
Ok so I live in Perth western Australia we are finally getting our own Costco I'm so excited but I'm curious at what products we will have access to and how Costco works?
I stop watching as soon as this moron ranting about the rotisserie chicken, completely healthy and no different then other stores. Or maybe I am from Canada so the chicken itself is much healthier
YUCK...Eat a pizza. Costco has the best pizza.
Costco actually sells the rotisserie chicken at a price below its value. It's a loss to them, but I guess it helps bring people into the store.
Coconot oil is not even healty according to new heath research, lard is healthier
What about sprouts? No mention of that store. Can you do a video about shopping there or a comparison video about sprouts and other stores?
THEW BEST TO AVIUD COSTCO QND THEIR WSHOP THEY ARE DANGEROUS  ET BUY THAT LARGE QUANTITY OF  FOOD  whne they 80 million diabetic   AND THEIR COSTOC EVERT  WHERE  PLEASE AVOID THEROR STUID ASSES   AND THEIR DANGEROUS QUANTITY OF  FOOD     THEY WILL  KILLINTHE LONG  RUN THEM AND RITE AID AND
I would honestly buy certain spices in that big bulk size. Parsley flakes, minced onion flakes, Italian seasoning, and onion powder. I use a TON of those every month.  ...also I do take some supplements, such as Vitamin D because I have PCOS and one of the far lesser known problems that comes from that is a difficulty in absorbing and using Vitamin D, leading to SEVERE deficiencies. I won't touch liver, I'm limited on how much cheese or eggs I can have, and I really, really despise seafood with every fiber of my being. Smelling it makes me want to hurl.
Why do we have to listen to that cacophony of background ‘music’ when the guy is talking?? Ridiculous😡
Talking about not wasting money while buying "organic" anything...  LOL.
This is the most Caucasian video I've ever seen
As a Costco employee I value this information. Bobby although this is your insight,  Costco will not lose its passionate members. I’ve always disliked the rotisserie chicken from there. Thank you
Palm kernel oil is pure
China is the source of evil.
What about the hot dogs?
was at costco the other day and found some pasture-raised organic brown eggs :)
Costco pineapple is the best!!! makes great smoothies also strawberries...I like the almond and soy mild there
douchebag
Art looks healthier. Must be the delicious pizza and hot dog! I love Costco chicken. Legs for soup, breast for chicken salad. I love the beautiful and reasonably priced clothes. To each his own.
Best pine nuts are American
This guy is irritating me 😅you are kindda bald going there and do that...
By the way ... i dont trust whole food, sprout all this shit anymore .... 70 percent of it is a lie.... i buy what ever now but i am still eating healthy , nothing is organic really, illuminati and satanist control everything😹depopulate us , they dont want us to breed  normally ,wake up people , do you researches!!!!
Love the bacon and all the products you recommend except the PB yuck. Sad to see the roast chicken is so bad. Never read the label just ate the yummy morsel. Good thing I hardly ever eat it. Make sense with all that junk infused that it taste so good. Uggh
Lost all credibility when you said "NO" to Rotisserie Chicken
Funny how you think u are so healthy.
The shit about ground spices is just that, spices used to spend 10+years travelling the seas to get where they had to and we're still fine. If you rub them between your fingers the heat revives the flavor
Costco organic eggs are now pasture raised and certified humane.
I live in Chicago and I go to this Costco all the time
New subscriber..   Awesome info...
At Costco. I buy solid beef(choice), and low % burger. In my area, a better price than comparable markets.  The take-n-bake pizza is a good deal, quality suffers a little, but it's a huge pie for $8.99.  If you are conscientious and comparison shop, clothing can be a deal, seasonally. I have had good luck with men's jeans($9.95), nice, thick flannel shirts, seasonal (9.99). It's just me and the ol' lady so we don't need a large supply of Cheerios, or peanut butter but it's a good buy if you can use it up. Pharmacy is great especially if no Ins. I was paying $125.00 at Rite Aid and had the privilege of crappy service, the same script at Costco $28.77, this is per month, I was astounded! That makes up for the membership fee. Last year I had a reward on the visa card ($429.00), this is my go-to card. They will cash that out in store for green money. Gasoline will be the best price in the area. One downside is the crowds especially weekends, sometimes a long check-out line. If you can go on off-hours it's OK.  Flat screens, 'puters, photo... etc are very much worth the look. Around these parts "Best Buy" usually isn't. If you want more jaded, useless comments, leave a comment below.
"açai Brazilian sugar water" maybe there in USA, here in BRA its a healthy thing
OK let me get this straight the eggs are not organic enough and he suggests that you go somewhere else and spend six dollars a dozen for eggs but yet be damn sure you stock up on that thick sliced bacon.
Can't afford organic eggs
The background whistling is pretty annoying
I do NOT consider butter healthy, nor chicken thighs, nor milk or eggs, nor bacon, nor deep fat frying.   If it had a face or a momma, I don't eat it.   I will not be following your advice.  Sorry.  lol   IMHO, if you want great health, you not only need to put great things in, such as the hemp hearts, but keep the bad things out, like bacon.
Keto, canola, coconut oil, antioxidant, etc. myths out the wazzoo.  But don't eat half a gram of sugar with your chicken.
out of all your items I would take the butter only most of the rest sit on the shelf for years
lol.. worrying about the conditions of the chickens that provide the eggs? They're there to pop out eggs until they die, and some extra happy-happy space won't change that. It just makes us feel like we're doing something. As far as the $5 chicken, get a life, it's chicken, cooked and seasoned in an assembly-line process. That doesn't make it bad for you. That makes it affordable.  To address the snarky comments in advance, do I care about chemicals in my food? Unless they're illegal, not really. Costco is not out to kill me. As far as the chickens's welfare, they are factory farmed to feed millions of Americans, no more, no less. They are not your typical beloved pets. If you care about them, then you will go 100% vegan and remove the demand side, otherwise, it's just window dressing.
Winco has peanut butter for like $2 a pound
Chinese pine nuts are not nuts? Not sure they are the best, but get your agriculture knowledge straight.
What about the cage free eggs that were behind you?
you get what you pay for...nothing learned here
You passed right by the baking soda a huge bag that last about a month and you ignored it, UNFORGIVABLE that's a humongous NO NO  do you have any idea all you can do with that???? please do a research about it and next time buy it!   ah the organic eggs are bed the the bacon that is pork is good? hell noooooooooooooooooo
Wow, people are resistant to basic health and humanity. Treating chickens like machines is so not humane, and no, antibiotics is not about natural "sickness" in animals; it's because they feed the animals food which make them sick (corn for cows, for example) and then need to feed antibiotics to keep them from dying -- which means we're chomping down on antibiotics in the meat AND in the water supply. Even my local supermarket offers a couple of kinds of no-antibiotic chicken for no extra cost. (Why should there be? Antibiotics are expensive!) The take away is, Costco offers some good deals, but be careful. I already knew that, but am grateful to learn what to take care over.  I'm just happy to hear that the cultured butter really is worth what I pay -- my doc believes in it, but I go crazy doing the math and remembering what it costs unsalted at, say, Whole Foods.
you should never deep fry or even pan fry anything in olive oil. Olive oil turns carcinogenic when heated. It should only be used for things like dressing. I"m surprised you would promote using it. Grapeseed is not good quality either. The only oil you should use for frying is coconut or avocado.
Best place to by cheese too.
however, I do agree, don't buy pre-cooked bacon uugghh, that's disgusting!
Mr. know-it-all!!
why haven't you done a video for Trader Joes or Aldi yet?
So many people here seem lost... Research tells U that eating dead animals that R eating soy, for example, is just plain unhealthy & downright cruel... Eating dead animals & animal products, eggs, cheese & yogurt come at a very high price to the animals who create those products U buy all packaged nicely & neatly.  U did not see how that animal was feed, raised & slaughtered. Not a pretty picture. Check out H.O.P.E. It is long over 1 hr. & of all the films regarding treatment of animals & animal products, it is less upsetting to see.  Maybe check out some people who know tons more than most of us, including me...I am always learning more & more...  There R many informative Docs about eating clean & why U should. it is your life, your body & quality of life. Eating clean is so important to being healthy & not being a party to the cruelty to animals.  It amazes me how people can love a dog, cat, but can so easily sit down & eat an animal that is an acid product in your body ( which encourages cancer cells). Please don't believe me... I am only passing on info I have discovered.   I too was blinded by the bullshit out there. I am WOKE!!! Please check out" FOOD INC."  "FORK OVER KNIVES", "EARTHLINGS," &  "LIVE & LET LIVE." Just a few Docs out there to enlighten u as it has me...  There is so much wrong with the food out there... It is your life, your body & of course always your choice.  I just know I am feeling better not eating dead animals...I gave up butter, for a coconut cashew vegan butter. So yummy & a better choice if U love living & being healthy... I am on that journey to a better quality of my life through a more informed way of eating & certainly cruelty-free... Again this ONLY MY OPINION VIA MY RESEARCH... Everyone needs to do their own homework & come to the conclusion best for them. Being educated, informed & knowledge is where it all started for me. I hope something I posted here stricks a cord with someone out there suffer, pain, poor health. someone seeking a kinder, better way to eat & live... I HOPE SOMETHING I SAID HERE RINGS A BELL FOR SOMEONE...  Eat well & prosper...
FYI it is illegal to use hormones in poultry. My chickens and ducks give me backyard eggs with dark orange yolks. Love the Kerry butter!
What do you think of better than bouillon?  It's my favorite chicken base for quick broths.
Costco chickens are cheap for a reason. Costco deliberately loses money on them as an incentive to come into the store where you will likely buy other things. As to the ingredients, dextrose is just sugar. It functions to aid in browning. He didn’t name anything in the ingredients that would keep me from buying them. I make delicious bone broth with the skin and carcass after eating the rest. He needs a course in basic food science and nutrition. Coconut oil isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. He’s not much of an expert IMO. He’s parroting a lot of hype from the latest food fads. Nuts are good at Costco. Sprouts, if you have one, beats Costco’s prices on produce and bulk grains and seeds, if you shop their sales. I’m not likely to subscribe on the basis of this vid.
This guy is mostly wrong, so the video is useless.
most of your suggestions are just shit for your health. wtf.
No offense, but Costco chicken doesn’t contain hormones and likely doesn’t contain preservatives. All poultry in the US is hormone free by law, and dextrose is a natural ingredient. It’s certainly not healthy, but the 4.99 price is a marketing strategy to attract customers to the back of the store. Costco loses money on every rotisserie sold.
Just because you can't pronounce it does NOT mean it's bad for you. Don't be an idiot, by your logic, dihydrogen monoxide is bad for you. The pronunciation difficulty has ZERO to do with the contents of the item so please stop spreading such ignorant misinformation. Also, the "fillers" in the chicken are just the seasoning, they sell the chickens at a loss in order to attract customers (just like the food court). Finally, happy chickens do not make better eggs, it's been tested countless times and there is zero difference in the nutrition or taste of the eggs, so if you want to do it for moral reasons, fine, but don't spread misinformation about the health content.
I like your comments. If you conscientiously eat the best natural food you don’t need the supplements which is  a very expensive (and questionable) way of getting nutrition. Reading food content labels is essential. Avoid highly processed foods. I’m not sure about coconut products though. But you’re right about the eggs. The living conditions of egg producing chickens is as horrific as Auschwitz. California just voted for raising the standards for caged animals like chickens, pigs and calves. It would be great to see other states follow California’s example. It’s not just better for the animals, it’s also better food for consumers. Thanks for your videos. I’ve subscribed. BTW I would never buy nuts from Trader Joe’s. They source from the cheapest vendors and the quality is atrocious. Often one can get a whiff of fumigant when you open a bag of nuts!
Bacon is good but no sugar veg juice is bad--ahhh no data for that.... Deep frying with any oil is the work of Satan.
He's not spent much time with chickens...they are cannibals. :P
Knows nothing about nutrition
Bobby--What the hell is "tired booty"?  As you came around the corner at  05:51 in (Aisle 307), reached down and picked up a large bag of what looked like potato chips that had "Aged White Cheddar" on the front of it.  Even the transcriber couldn't decide if you meant "moody" , "booty" or "booties".  It seemed hilarious to you, but it made no sense.  You held the bag in such a way that I couldn't read what the product was supposed to be.  I assume it's one we should avoid, since that seemed to be your theme.  And yet, you picked it up and put it in your basket.  And yet, you advocated the purchase of thick-cut bacon.  My advice is:  If you've got a theme you're promoting, stick with it; otherwise, you look like a hypocrite.
This guy’s such a pretentious douche. I bet he tweezes his ass hairs.
Art is MY kind of guy. 😂
just happen to stubble across your video , wow thats great info thanks !!
Peanut butter is full of sugar and has palm oil. Not very healthy to me. It is better to go to a store where u can make your own peanut butter.
But that rotisserie chicken is to die for
Bacon is a class 1 carcinogen and saturated fat isn't good for you. This is no good.
I love the ending with all the bad foods you shouldn't eat!
Wow, where do you live! I'm CA my almond butter at costco is 12.99. Everything else here cost so much more than at your costco.
clearly a very ignorant individual. you do realize you’re at a COSCO grocery store right? Don’t advice people to buy items based on what works for YOUR lifestyle and preferences....
I really dislike your whistling soundtrack. Musical brain damage.
Why do you think it's harder to control the salt when you're cooking whit salted butter?? Do you not taste your food before u put salt in ? There's no butter out there that will make your food to salty ! It's step 2 of salt that can make your food salty.. as long as u taste be4 u put in additional salt there's no probs... ;-) nice video though..  Big bless from Sweden
"Oh my god, rotisserie chicken has starch in it!". Your beloved quinoa is 50% starch you moron.
I’m sorry but I can’t trust someone who thinks keto is healthy and recommends bacon, Cooks with oils and recommends kerrygold butter. Keto diet will create cardiovascular problems in the long run and it’s not sustainable for long term health.
Wow! Had to sub! So much valuable info. Thanks! Awesome job👍
I feel like most of the "ingredients" in the rotisserie chicken were in the rub the put on it, but otherwise that was almost as much fun as going to Costco myself! I use a lot of Quinoa to flesh out the stuff I know I shouldn't be eating like Kraft Dinner or canned pasta. When I'm hella broke, a half cup of quinoa and a can of beans makes for two seriously filling meals. Add in a half avocado on toast to round out the proteins and I can feel pretty good about what's in my tummy for about a buck, buck fifty a meal. Not great, but as I said that's when I'm broke as hell.
Good Job Bro ..thank you!
Great information.  Please do more.
I'm a new Costco member who usually shops locally for good healthy food and products at great prices. Here, it's like a shop-til-you-drop foodfest with ginormous carts to fill up with years' supplies of stuff for people who don't have or take the time to shop around locally. The money they end up saving is gobbled up by the massive amounts this formula encourages you to buy. Bobby is so right about the chickens and eggs and most of the things he describes, but for the folks who are Costco junkies, they're not very pleased.
The eggs next to the organic ones are cage free.....
Next time just tell the egg people the chickens are hurt
This guy's a pretentious hypocritical food trendy douche who doesn't understand nutrition.
Your a very  annoying person ( just saying )
Just because you like it doesn't make it right for everyone else.
I'm surprised Costco hasn't flagged this video🙈
Have you no shame singling out the age of the "guardian" at the gate.  Cool comment does not pass for a joke.  Shame on you.
I have a feeling he's one of those types of people.
Ha Ha, those people in the fridge were just like don't tell me what to do just gimme my damn eggs.
Listen up you pretentious arrogant pompous why are you at Costco if you're going to look your nose down on the items? If your palate is so refine so prestige why spend your time on a rotisserie chicken? you know for somebody that's trying to promote healthy you might want to look at your face it's a little bit dehydrated and you flat-out look tired. So give me a favor back to fuck off I don't care who the fuck you are and why the fuck am I watching this video? Oh yeah that's right I'm proud of Costco and Sam's Club.
Question: "What is a good alternative to Costco Rotisserie chicken?" Answer: "Buy one and cook it at home"                  You couldn't make this stuff up.                               Just like cheap fillers bulk out food - that was a cheap filler to bulk out your video.
Everything else you suggested is great except the bacon anything made from pork is extremely unhealthy.if you like to be healthy stay away from bacon but there are better alternatives available like turkey bacon 😊
I luv Costco
The whistling in the background is really getting on my nerves so cut it now.......................😎😎😁😁😁😎😎
Lol....hands eggs to folks, after bitching about them.
The whistling background is very annoying. I always enjoy shopping for good deals. I take his advice with a grain of salt. I have an alternative health practitioner who I see yearly to get my bloodwork to check for deficiencies and abnormal values to keep me in charge of my health. There is no ONE DIET for all. We all are unique. I think it’s called bio individuality? I enjoyed the video. I’ll check out your website for the almond biscotti.
Keto was made for cancer people not healthy
He is middle age!
L T
They sell the chicken at a loss, though
Bobby, you mentioned a quinoa breakfast bowl.  Can’t find the recipe here or on your site.  Please share!  I love quinoa.
Very nice job. I enjoyed it.
If you cannot pronounce the words it means you don’t know what they are or mean. Shows your ignorance so why should viewers take what you’re saying in this video as the gospel truth?
Meanwhile, people in other countries starve to dead.
They lose money on the chickens. It's a business decision because very few people ONLY buy the chickens so costco can afford to lose money on the chickens
He is right about the Costco Applewood Smoked Bacon.  It is the best.  Not healthy, though.  It's bacon.  So if you're eating bacon you shouldn't worry about the brine (which is mostly just salt) in the chicken. And besides you can't make a chicken at home for $4.99.  Price a whole chicken; you'll be paying at least $6 (and likely more) for a raw, unseasoned chicken.
Dont use flax seeds -your dick will die from the phyto oestrogens.Stay off soya for the same reason.U dont want to assault yr partner with a dead weapon !
how do I dislike twice
Many of Costco's products come from China but are channeled through US dealers
I think those Costco customers see you as the middle-aged guy who gets in the way of their shopping
Pine nuts from the PRC are no good.  Maybe you should do the same with all the other items.  Where is the quinoa from, for example?
I know for a fact this dude shops at Trader Joe’s 😂
Bio get yo ass back to Trader Joe’s 💀
Non of this considered one be healthy, I don’t understand where you get you information about health food
....
All eggs taste the same
The only problem with Kerrygold is that it manufactured here in the USA. East coast.
Your justifications and explanation makeeeeeee the darn video.  So educational.  So invaluable. u just saved me about 3 hours of research. So much gratitude for you!!!
you lost this whole video when you bought the coconut oil. look at the saturated fat in it. THEN look at the poly and mono UNSATURATED fats in it. there is no unsaturated fat. its a joke. the american heart association is against using coconut "oil" but the funny thing is, its not oil. its all saturated in that bin hahah
Dude, slow down when you’re eating! No choking is allowed. Sorry I know I’m butting in, just needed to say that.
Chemo diet
Healthy choices... Butter, bacon, coconut oil. Are you on a saturated fat diet? I’m sticking with whole plant foods for a healthy diet. McDougall, NutritionFacts, Neal Barnard, Garth Davis for health advice.
Aren't you middle-age?
Excellent ideas
Costco prices are SO different in 🇨🇦
I’m confused by your animal welfare concerns: Pay prime price for eggs from “happy chickens” but “don’t pass on the bacon”??
I like all your recommendations. But your grocery cart looks pretty expensive. How can you shop at Costco or any grocery store and eat pretty healthy on a much smaller budget? This would be especially important for larger families who want to try and eat healthy and have food sensitivities
Lol I should marry this guy !,, so that I will not worry about cooking , diet and health  ... 😊😊😊
I want to see more Archie. I mean it's called balance xD
Lotsa COOL products in your Costco that we don't have here but as for the butter, no Irish butter here, but there's a SO GOOD french butter, the butter is unsalted and is sold in 500gr/1.1lb. packages, the name is Président and French butter is produced by "happy cows", a friend in France told me this, no antibiotics or hormones in the milk that make it, its expensive, I don't remember the price as I just saw it yesterday but for the best pastries, nothing compares to French Butter! Could be similar to the Irish Gold, you said this butter was salted, Président isn't, its unsalted.
Chickens are not and have never been 'full of hormones.' Do your homework!
My daughter says this guy is a douche bag, I agree
Love this guy👍🏻💯
Coconut oil considered poison by the nutrition experts from Harvard (they are correct) but we see the “expert” buying in bulk here.
first he said cooked chicken is no good , full of additive. Now he said Kerry butter is good for you  , full of fat and salted . Im so confused or he is full of it.
The constant whistling in the background gave me a migraine. Can't take that annoying noise. It's completely unnecessary and offensive to my senses.
i only got to 3:46 and had to stop. people dont just buy food because its better theres a cost factor and some people think that cost is a major factor. i dont even buy organic i buy the massive produced eggs, i buy margarine, not butter. if i want something to taste amazing i use crisco every now and then for special occasions.
Every time I buy the almond butter there it's rancid. If you buy it open a jar before you leave so you can return it before you leave the parking lot. Or don't buy it. Not a great deal if you have to bring it back.
What an F,ing Jerk.
Brown eggs over white eggs is just a fetish. Free range eggs usually have best egg yolks.
I think his ideas on what constitutes healthy or unhealthy food are somewhat misguided.  His cart consist of mostly oils and fats and I don't know if he's ever opened up a coconut, but the coconut oil doesn't just flow right out of it.  It takes no more processing to generate safflower oil than it does coconut oil.  He did qualify it by saying they were his personal recommendations though so I don't think anyone can get too mad at him.  If he eats a bowl of grains, oil, and nuts every day then good for him.
Ageist asshole. As a "middle aged" human being, you're someday just going to be a jerk trying to recapture your youth, because the corporate American Machine sells to those with a "shelf life". What an incredibly unimaginative assumption with which to live your largely unconscious young adulthood.
Did he say "Poh-Cans"?
Um, if you deep fry with that olive oil blend it will start smoking and make your entire house smell like smoke for months. Just one terribly misinformed suggestion from a grade a moron pretending he knows his stuff.
Still assist the guy with eggs, so you partake in the crime.....lol
I buy almonds at Trader Joes because they use low heat on almonds rather than a chemical.  Yes, on the almonds labeled raw, per regulations.
he is preaching about those eggs, yet talking about chicken is OK . oh yeah, free ranch chickens so we can then slaughter them. there is no kind way to treat animals that you are going to kill.  Ignorance.
You talk about being healthy (healthy eggs, etc.), but bacon is not healthy! It has a lot of salt, nitrates, and saturated fat (which can lead to heart disease). There are many articles that talk about why bacon, processed meat, red meat, and deli meat isn't good for you...can help contribute to one getting colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer.
Sodium is horrendous!!
You are comparing Wholefoods to Costco? Really? 😝
Wow so gross
Lose the whistling music, please!
Good content but the music needs to go, very annoying.
Dairy still causes cancer. Dairy is for baby cows and the baby has to be ripped away from its mom and the mom has to be hooked up to a milking machine for about 12 years til it can't stand up any longer and then is sent off to slaughter. Dairy has enough hormones to make a baby cow grow 400 pounds in a year. You are not a baby cow.
Excellent clip.  Thx.
Can you just replace Almond flour for regular flour...and have the same quantities and everything? Like it would stay the same in the recipe? Does that make sense? lol
He is telling the thruith. I did the study.
Thank God he didn’t touch my beloved butter croissants 🥐
read ingredients of good stuff. XD
you didn't recommend the uncured bacon, I wonder why.
I'm curious why he didn't go through the nitrates and sugar in the bacon since he is all "organic" etc.😂
Spices don't "go bad".  They can lose potency over time, so just use more.  If you buy spices in bulk at Costco, it's usually for commercial cooking, but if it's for personal use, just freeze part of it for later.
You are not correct about the rotisserie chicken.  I have seen them put the raw chickens on the spit.  They are the same chickens they sell not cooked.
Do and don’t videos are just asking for trouble, as everyone subscribes to different beliefs, diets and standards. If you are on Keto, butter and bacon are great buys but if you are vegan not so much. If you can afford organic eggs great, but if you can’t Costco eggs are a good buy. Costco has said their rotisserie chickens are priced low because they provide a nutritious meal for low income families and after considering raising the price as they loose money on them, they decided against it. Everyone should take into account their individual needs and make the best choice for them. Sometimes compromises have to be made but each day is a new day. Do what you can and strive to make better choices for you, tomorrow!
WHY was this even a suggested video? Too much negativity.
I have to disagree about the Robert irvine protein bars. They have the best macros that I’ve found in a bar that doesn’t taste like trash. Should you eat them every day, no. But you should be cooking meals and having protein bars once in a while. And those bars are bomb.
why am I spending my Friday night watching a guy tell me what to buy at Costco?  I'm only 15.  What am I doing with my life?
Go vegan people! Meat is carcinogenic. See www.nutritionfacts.org
oil from a bottle is NOT healthy. The oil from eating whole olives IS healthy. Without the fiber to regulate absorbtion you are eating TOO MUCH OIL.  When Samuel L. Jackson went through the Mayo Clinic's full body examination they found a massive arterial blockage. His options were life-threatening surgery or eliminating ALL OILS and going 100% plant based (fruit, vegetables, grains, beans, only) while undergoing medication. It worked. Hes back eating certain animal products in MODERATION. I assume this is less than two servings per WEEK. As for oils, let me clear.... ALL oils create inflammation even omega 3 rich oil if the quantity of oil is incorrect. Most people add far too much to their cooking. You may have an arterial issue and be unaware of it because detecting arterial issues are tricky sometimes using just routine testing. Either way if you are trying to be healthy you DO NOT NEED OILS. Simply eat more chia seeds or flax seeds if you want to keep your Omega 3 and 6 balance correct. Secondly, do NOT eat peanut butter that has ANY hydrogenated oil period. If you can hold the jar upside down without the lid on and none pours out then throw it in the garbage asap. A single serving of PB with hydrogenated oil will take nearly 2 months to leave your bloodstream entirely. Get the organic peanut butter that is always "pourable" and use it SPARINGLY.  Third EGGS ARE NOT HEALTHY. They contain all the cholesterol you should have in a day. It's a great once in a while food if you grew up on it. But the nutrition in an egg is so insufficient that it cannot be legally marketed as healthy. Meaning it is literally illegal for egg companies to say their product is healthy. They can only say its incredible or edible. Lastly DO NOT increase your consumption of foods high in saturated fat without scheduling bloodwork to see how you are adapting to it. Everyone is different and processing the high level of triglyceride in coconut products can have disastrous effects in people with a family history of high blood pressure or high LDL cholesterol. You can set yourslef up for cognitive issues like vascular dementia. oils are not to be played with, if you increase your consumption of them in a significant way, get your bloodwork done by a doctor who is well versed in this area.
costco vodka!...heyyyy
"No one needs that much booty in their life". Lol
the cosco rotisserie chicken has soy in it, soy overloads you with estregen and causes breast and prostrate cancer, all cosco bakery stuff has soy in it. if you are not smart enough to figer or eaven look up the health problems of soy than you deserve to get cancer. since i stoped eating soy i have lost a  lot of wheight.
He has done a lot research, looking into products and comparisons.  A lot of good information here  Good hemp hearts, grass fed butter, think cut bacon, quinoa breakfast bowl 🍲
who are you, are you another expert . or another youtube expert ..just asking .. did you know that healthy or so called die of heart attacks..you know why, they dont eat real food and their body doesnt like it .. eat what you want but dont under do what your body craves and often needs.. everything in moderation..
Thank you! We've got Costco in Australia and we love it. According to food, we've discovered Dr Goundry's "Plant Paradox" and we try to follow his suggestions. Highly recommend. All the best!   :)
Call the company to find out if it is cold press.
What if you remove the skin from the rotisserie chicken?
Almond butter still have sugar but if you buy raw organic almond butter is much better , for looking good butter needs to b grass fed butter or Europeans butter much better than US
I wanted to finish watching this but that annoying background music was too much.
what a crock of shit
“If you’re a butter fan, a keto fan”... oh yeah, now I know who this guy is. He makes money off people buying into the keto bullturd him and his followers are preaching. Use cronometer.com (yes, crono without the h after the c) and enter the details, be blown away by the numbers. But how bad really is it? Well, what do you think the Standard American Diet (SAD) and lately also more and more so European diets too, they are all about eating animal fats and those make you sick. So, just plant oils then, that’s good or at least not so bad, right? Sure, so it smoking 10 cigarettes a day instead of 15. Don’t listen to frauds like him and other wannabe doctors (they are “holistic doctors” AKA not medical professionals with a doctor license!!!), they are all out to sell you their stuff AKA frauds.
You poo poo'in the Kombucha .... shame on you!
Thanks for sharing, the information on the eggs was good, I buy Costco eggs now and then, but I do prefer the cage free eggs because you definitely can taste the difference.
If this guy wants to pay for me to buy eggs from "happy chickens that play all day" I'd be thrilled to eat those, along with many other foods he says are better.  But many of us mortals who would need to rob a bank to eat what he says is all we should eat.  And as for those rotisserie chickens, I think they are a good enough treat when I need an easy meal that involves as little effort as humanly possible. FYI they brine their chickens & most ingredients he read off were from that.  As you just soak a chicken in the brine, then put it on spit, little stays IN/ON the chicken.   It is far healthier than most other things I would choose those nights, along w/being far more economical, and something I only buy now & again.  (I have severe nerve damage & don't always have the luxury to stand & cook :(
I wanted to like this video but after he started preaching about how chickens need to roam free, and then an aisle later says to buy thick cut bacon.......wth dude.  Pigs have it the absolute worst out of all the mass produced animals out there.   --
Hi, Bobby!  This is my first time viewing one of your videos and I was really interested in your information, UNTIL around 4:04, and I couldn't concentrate on you because of that incessant, unnecessary, obnoxious, tiresome Whistling!!  I clicked on Pause (it also Mutes) and decided to read the comments below.  I got through a  whole bunch of them, but the whistling stayed faintly in my head.   Couldn't make it go away!  That caused me multiple Ear-worms, and now I don't want to go back and finish watching the video.  May I ask, in all sincerity:   why on earth did you add that shrill whistling?  I really want to know.  Whether or not your research is valid, I want to know what you've found out.  Get rid of the whistling and I'll check back to see if I can watch it.  Your reply will come to my  email box.  Right now, I'm going to my music lists to find some Moody Blues, Doors or Jimi Hendrix to listen to, hoping it rids me of the whistling ear-worms.   :-)    DBB
I am a demo lady .....at Costco ..they use that rotisserie chicken for everything ....
what a great vlog!!!
Sorry, but your statements have shown clearly that you do not know what you are talking about.  This is a classic example of the ignorant person who truly believes their own bullshit.
Everyone has different taste buds and just because one thing is healthy doesn't mean there aren't other things as healthy as well.
more hauls at different stores amazon trader joes would be appreciated !
organic stuff is scam, just like global cooling , um, global warming, wait a minute, "climate change" is hoax.
He is showing bacon buy it thick is the right one he does not know what he is talking about. Be careful about the kind of Coconut oil you use and don't deep fry food unless you've not to die of a stroke
Awkward "I know black people" forced hand shake https://youtu.be/0ZIgtLzCqTk?t=93
You shouldn't eat bacon because of the fat unless you want to die of a stroke
why the fuck should i care if the eggs come from a farm where they can run around with rainbows...i'd rather save $6 and feed my family rather than pay $12 so i can make sure a chicken is happy with all the rainbows.
Where does this man get his food facts from?  It has been estimated that refined vegetable oils extracted with hexane contain approximately 0.8 milligrams of residual hexane per kilogram of oil (0.8 ppm) (2). It is also estimated that the level of ingestion of hexane from all food sources is less than 2% of the daily intake from all other sources, primarily gasoline fumes. There appears to be very little reason for concern about the trace levels of hexane in canola oil.     Too many partial truths from his lips.
Hi, I  was just told I need my thyroid removed and I  saw a video  say not to buy peanut butter but to buy almond butter. Not exactly sure why.
Great vid BUT Irritating whistling background music Why?
Would love more haul video's from Trader Joe's, whole foods, fine fair etc. Thank you love your videos
I'm going to buy the microwave bacon tonight 🤣🤣🤣
Costco rotisserie chicken is bad?  So convenient.  I don't buy them often, but I will continue.    All those seeds, I never heard of!   Seems like we can't eat anything these days!!!
A friend of mine has a brother-in-law who tested some of their products and it had a bunch of filler in it! You talk about healthy food and he is eating major junk food...hot dog and pizza.
I don’t like oil in plastic. They melted it to put it plastic! I wonder if it doesn’t bleach chemicals from the plastic.
"kombucha makes me gassy"  it makes you gassy cause its feeding your good gut bacteria... this video is ridiculous
Happy eggs
I always thought their rotisserie chicken tasted wired never really liked it but these are dark times you know ... when you’re hungry most things will taste great lol
He looks so opinionated and stupid.
You lost me on your middle age comment ...I didn't know you had to be young to shop at Costco ...better look in the mirror ..snob
mmmmmm. happy eggs. Remind me..... What are eggs again?
your awsome...very very true and genuine..thankyou😊
I use so much cinnamon...I know it’s bad for me, but I literally use more than 2 tbsp for breakfast.... 😐
No joke I'm eating chicken salad sandwich from a rotisserie chicken right now. Its good.
If you want to eat healthily DO NOT buy any fat in plastic containers! The  solvants that prevent the containers from becoming brittle are fatsoluble  and leach into the oil,  margarine,  cheese and what not. Buy glass containers, that are tinted  brown or  green,  so the UV Light doesn't destroy any vitamins. Fun fact: olive oil  should not be used for frying at high temperatures, since it degrades into toxic and possibly cancerogenic particles.
Thank you will today my own chicken!!!!! Will be following you
We bought the eggs  here in Sacramento  $ 7.49  for 2 dozen.$5.99 must be a on sale price.
This is a comment for particularly 7:16. I would have brought that big jar of Cumin powder as one can always retain it’s flavour by just using a small tip. It’s simple one just has to roast them on low flame for few seconds. Let it cool a bit and voila !! It is ready to use !!
It's cheap because it's a signature item that brings people into the store. What makes him think he knows if the company sells it at that price and makes a profit off of it or not. They are real chickens that are healthy for anyone to eat. This guy is spreading lies without proper research. Very damaging to spread these kinds of lies.
No rotisserie chicken? I don't like you!
Is it refrigerated?
"10 Healthy Pantry Items . . . ", my screen is frozen on BACON.  . . . and I'm outta here!
Robert Irvine is only out for the Money
What an idiot
This guy must be really fun at parties.
After watching for 5 mins I really just wanna punch this guy and force him to eat rotisserie chicken.
is your name Dick
Hey, what's wrong with Kombucha?
Why do you use vegan yogurt in your quinoa bowl when you eat bacon and eggs?
Eggs are not healthy
I’m just so tired of people saying how coconut oil is so good for you when you can do a little research and find out it is the worst possible cooking oil to consume worse then lard
everything you liked tastes disgusting... if you preached to me at costco i'd lock you in one of there plastic shed's....
Saying the chicken is bad  because of the price,  You should know that  cosco  sails them at a  lost  a fore years  and  as of 2018  each one sold cosco losses $3  so they are $8  chickens. The ingredients on the container is of the Adding Spices. Witch used to be sold next to or near the chicken years ago
You are just literally buying what you wanted
Had to giggle.. Oh hunny I do go through that much cumin.
Butter is salted so it doesn’t go rancid. Unsalted butter spoils very quickly.
Yikes. You’d never find an empty aisle like that at our Costco. It’s always just packed.
I only buy California Olive Ranch olive oil.  California has the strictest standards and COR bottle their oil in dark green bottles.  Best to buy in smaller quantities, too because once you open it air, light, and heat starts to degrade it.  If you care about quality olive oil, be sure it’s from Cali, because a lot of these brands in the stores cut them with other oils and charge a small fortune for them.  Dr Oz had oils tested.  I’m sure you can Google it for more info.
LOL several months ago (before my own chicks began to lay). I bought the Costco 'cage free' eggs, when I cracked it open the yolk was far from golden yellow...so I called them, day or two later the customer service rep called me to say  the farmers told him the chickens were only fed OMG!   CORN & SOYBEAN  AHAHHHHAH  Naturally I told him that was a horrible feed. So glad my girls have been laying, there is nothing healthier than eggs from well fed free range hens. Happy Thanksgiving. Your video was very good.
Where do you buy costco gift cards?
"Healthy Pantry Items"  *picks up bacon*  ....????
Talk about a food snob....this guy has an arrongance about him. And that chicken... it's not like people eat that every day. Everything in moderation and you'll be fine.
all animal products involve mass cruelty to animals. kept diet is a cruelty diet
LOL stopped listening after the ingredients in the rotisserie chicken were read.  Basically you read the part of the simple ingredients in the brine (salt, sugar, water) used to tenderize and season the chicken.  In this case they used dextrose (sugar) and granulated sugar.  Corn starch is used as a shield to protect the meat while cooking in intense heat.....like an industrial sized rotisserie at Costco.
Thank you
​ FlavCity with Bobby Parrish   Ever heard of a loss-leader????  What's so poisonous about modified food starch, sugar  or dextrose?  It says  right on the Kirkland label that it is hormone free.  Also, antibiotic-free since at least 2015.  Have you been contacted by Costco lawyers yet or is your pandering to other ignorants like yourself not putting a dent in sales?   Living proof that anyone can have a YouTube channel and have 4500+ Public school graduates up vote your authoritarian bs. Here You go: https://www.thedailymeal.com/cook/15-secrets-499-costco-rotisserie-chicken-slideshow
Thank you so much for this video. Very helpful
I beg to differ with you.  Many of those Organic Eggs are from Wilcox farm and they are farm raised.  My daughter has toured their facility and was very impressed.
I was interested in what he has to say at first but he lost me when he said god knows how much sugar is in coldcrew coffee... this idiot
That's your opinion dude. Who says you are right
I just bought my “chosen foods” avocado 🥑 oil  from Costco 👍🏼
What about the white eggs that said "cage free"       on the box?
It takes an add hole to offend people and can't see what you said. You are a little boy. Shame on you. You are a reflection of your up bringing.💩💩💩
IMO... I think the title should have been what I prefer to but and not buy instead of saying "what to avoid" Somethings are fact based (like veggie oil) and somethings are opinion based.
Kids should not be eating gummies. But gah I love Costco.
I once was a manager in retail, in pre-cell phone camera times.  We had to prohibit people taking photos.  All the displays were copyrighted.  I can't imagine dealing with this nowadays.
I've eaten spices that were decades old. I disagree with about half of what he says. Canola is literally one of the worst things you can buy. This guy is clueless. Look up how grapes seed oil and canola oils are made. And about the nuts, you buy salted nuts, kills bacteria on contact.
I buy eggs from my neighbor. And the rotisserie chickens are  literally the best deal in food. Pre-cooked? no Cleaning? That's like a $5-$10 value in my time.
I know that you weren't on board with the whole supplements thing but its something that really helped me when I was taking medication that was lowering my energy levels excessively. The B vitamin complexes brought me out of not being able to stay up during the day and kept me away from coffee. Just because something doesn't work for you doesn't mean it wont work for everyone else.
hmmmm so health conscious.... are they fair trade ?
Uuugh, guy who’s looking for deals but has enough money to provide chickens a better life and eat keto. Dude, your not right.
I am starting to get a complex, I like your video but no one else does, does that make me a vegan?
good info. interesting.  the whistling in the background maddening.
What let you think that peanut butter is good for you? You are avoiding salt but eating hydrogenated oils presented in peanut butter?
Why do you even go there? Just go to your favorite store which is obviously not Costco. Save membership cost and spend it on elsewhere.
I love Costco too
Other then meditarian oil which oil is best for deep frying? Can I use coconut oil for deep frying?
Which Costco in Chicago is this?
Ok. Stop right there...coconut oil! Surely you're kidding. That's SO UNHEALTHY! I'm just old enough to remember how we (the public) were sold this unhealthy product back a couple of decades ago. It wasn't good then, and it's not good now. Sorry to burst your bubble but stop telling people it's healthy. It is NOT. Stick with olive oil.
You had me right up until the peanut butter.  Not a "nut" but a legume, and grown with lots of mold.  Taste-wise, I prefer it over almond butter, but health-wise, I just had to say "no."
so the nut butters are good price but how is there quality???
Love the honesty
Who has the time to roast this roast that??!!  And I like salt.  I use Adkins/Keto diet.  If you live in a small place when you go do COSTCO you have to think about storing that stuff.  The first thing I check is the Carb count. Period.  Full Stop.  And who has all that time??
ther,e is nothing wrong with the roast chicken you can make a salad or a Sandwich with cheese chicken avocado mayo and tomato lettuce duh.he,s one of those snob toffee nose know it all pathetic dumbass.he must be gay and the way that he talks.
bro you dont eat chi cken eggs from caged chickens but you eat caged farmed out pork?  lol please tell me whats wrong with this picture
1:35 awkward handshake
Also, U don't need tons of protein... Best to eat an organic plant-based diet... I hate to tell U that no animals raised in the USA to my informed knowledge are they R all not raised well, or killed well... They eat grains, R not really living the life they should & surely R not slaughtered pain-free.. I only know of 1 farm that is raising proper organic cows. They R however still killed in a painful way. Not good!! It is in Upstate NY. The farm is not very big, but even though the animals R feed well roam free, they die a painful death... The farm is run by Sandy Lewis... He is very strict about his cows never being shot with antibiotics!!! Please check it out for yourself. Please don't take my word for anything. Please do your own homework & research.
This roast chicken is so unhealthy look at all the spooky chemicals and additives it has. Gotta buy this processed preserved bacon!
I hate to mess with your video, but most of this is useless.. 1. Don't eat dead animals. 2. stop with animal products. U can get Miyoko's vegan butter... Not from animals. She is also making non-animal cheeses..... Time to realize all animals organic or not meet with a cruel painful cold death.. They are not treated with respect. They suffer much pain when they R killed. organic or not.. Don't eat bacon. U R eating pigs that were tortured before they died. They R scalded alive, stabbed with hooks in their nose, rump. As babies, their tails R cut off without any anesthetic.... Regarding Whole Foods, they R apart of Monsanto's,& most of their food is NOT organic!!! U R misleading people, because U  R not informed enough. Please do your homework before U tell people what to eat or not eat. U don't have enough information to give health advice... I have done tons of homework & I still have tons more to learn....  I think so do U.......
Will I go through that much cumin in 6 mothss?  Yes!  I put it in everything.  Tasty!
this guy just told yah that kombucha is bad and bacon is good... riiiiiiiiiight
The bit about only one nuts from China causing the syndrome has been disproven. ALL pine nuts can cause it, regardless of country of origin. If it happens to you, best avoid all of them.
This man is so ill informed and ignorant.  1. The ingredients listed on the rotisserie chicken are from spice blends they use to season the goddamn chicken. 2. He said the chicken are “cooped up in little cages” when the box behind him literally said “cage free eggs.” 3. Bacon is not healthy especially with all those sulphites even natural sulphites hidden under the word “cultured celery extract”.
Aldi would be great
Fuck you and your remark about middle age people. You had horrible parents you are a reflection of them . You make me sick😝😝😝😝😝😝
Okay you are so annoying with the bulk spices. You can save money. Just freeze the rest. It is way cheaper than your favorite Trader's Joes.
The thick cut bacon I bet has nitrates. Nitrate free meats are healthier. Roasted chicken is healthy even if on the ingredients it lists the spices the put on it before it is roasted. Better than a bucket of fried chicken from KFC.
dude chia seeds bad for u per dr gundry.
It great if you can afford eggs that cost double that, but the majority of people cannot. I am sure most people would choose to buy happy meat, eggs, and dairy if they could,  but it simply is not possible for most.
The coconut water and coconut cream from Trader Joe’s suck! Coconut cream there at Trader Joe’s is so watery nothing like a cream. Way to thin. And neither the coconut water nor the cream are good. If Trader Joe’s had a different brand like Arroy-D I might actually try it from there but they both suck for cooking. I buy Thai Kitchen coconut cream and milk because the consistency is much better and so is the taste, texture, etc..
The hot dog and pizza are the bomb!
Don't buy the organic eggs but buy the thick-cut bacon?
Im a mostly Mcdougall er myself, but ill watch anything Costco.
Thank you so much for the background on the org eggs. I find the cinnamon at Costco is blander than in bulk at natural food store
s.This guy is annoying
I like that the point that the lady made about the eggs They’re the healthiest at Costco  Sometimes you just have to shop and go and compromise so you’re not driving around town  There’s so many good tips for Costco shopping on this video and others  Always helpful  Thank you  I think we all have our version of what healthy is I don’t buy oils in plastic for instance
Love the Acai juice.. Pesto. That Irish butter. Biscotti in the big jar. Filet Mignon. I'm going to Costco this afternoon. Gonna buy a chicken.
I don't care. I'm gonna eat the chicken.
Legit.
This’s so sugary
This is the first video of yours that I've seen and I've subscribed.  I appreciate all of the info and am diabetic so I need to learn as much as I can about what to eat and not eat.  Thank you for a great video!
Do you have to buy a membership to shop here?
What a pretentious douchecanoe!
There should be a warning label on this video..."For foodie nuts only"
A family of four can eat on a Costco chicken for $5 and use the leftover bones for stock. It's a great healthy value for working families. Fuck this smug weenie.
How ironic that you go nuts for the bacon and condescend to someone buying organic eggs. Pigs are raised with appalling lack of humane treatment! Of the two species, they are mammals with intelligence and personality. Yeah, delicious too. Gonna walk the walk, talk the talk.
I cant take vitamins In tablet or pill form so instead the gummies help. BUT since you say it isnt that great, any advice on good brands that sell powder or liquid forms ??
Here is the truth: eating a Costco $5 chicken is much better for you than the alternatives regular people make such as the drive through. The eggs at Costco that are organic or not are just as healthy as any other egg. If you can afford 2x the price if the Costco organic, or 4x the price of the regular, and want to make an ethical choice that is what you're doing. Dont listen to this man's lies. He's selling you a religion that rich white people can afford and not something that is going to make for healthier people at all incomes.
can you have quinoa on Keto? I looked at carbs its really high
Countering his bullshit: https://www.zmescience.com/other/science-abc/organic-food-science02092015/
Yeah! Good luck on that rotisserie chicken thing at Costco.
This guy is selling white yuppie religion, not science: https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-go-organic
The bullshit about the chicken makes the rest of the video invalid. The chickens are entirely healthy.
Please shorten your videos. Good info but too long
The pizza slice and hotdog do not look appetizing at all. :-(
why so many dislikes Y'all?? Im just curious and Im not subbed...yet
Aldis plzzzz can you do items to buy and not to buy ❤️
You have to remember that not everyone uses that much spice for food. Sometimes they're used in cold process soaps for colorants or oil infusions, and yes we go through that much. Especially if you sell your products. And again... soapmakers use canola oil in soaps. Especially if it's high in oleic acid. Soapmakers love Costco for the spices, herbs, and oils.
Sadly, we can’t get Kerry Gold or anything similar in Canada. Which is weird because we have so much variety, you’d think even a local dairy would think to make something similar.
How can I know if the chickens are free range? What is the difference between free range and cage free?
This is the first time I ever watched you and wow I can’t believe the negative comments you get! People are so ignorant! I’m actually vegan and didn’t realize you’re a proponent of a keto diet until I started watching (yikes, don’t get me started on being afraid of the sugar in fruit, but bacon being ok) but I agree with you on avoiding the chemicals in food. I still feed my family meat, dairy and eggs. I will NEVER buy a roasted chicken for $4.99! I don’t care what the commenters say.
I understand the premise of your video. Most of the things at Costco are in bulk and large quantities for larger servings. Keep that in mind. What I don't understand is your comparison to the products with what I call, budget fails... like Whole "paycheck" and Trad-yer "paycheck." The majority of people try to look for bargains while having it nutritionally dense for the family! It seems to me that your goal here was to find healthy options directed to your own personal health goals which many can't relate to. Maybe add a caption or modify the title to direct it to a certain group of audience. Good try, not really. Lol
Nobody cares about you
What a fool
i like the pepperoni pizza at costco
The roast chicken, much like their food court options are draw items.  People are drawn by these low cost items (even at a near profit loss) so that Costco can get you to spend money on other things
That pizza looks yummy
I would rather eat the garbage then that crap he was buying
thanks
Great video but please cut the whistling music out!😳  it's super annoying!  Thx
Good video! Could improve his tone a little more because not everyone have the money to buy $12 eggs. This $6.99 two dozen eggs could be the most affordable organic product that they can get access to. Not everyone has the money to eat good and organic. Could be more inclusive and considerate.
I hope costco revokes this dipshits membership. Try to revive yourself with the bacon....get tf out
Sorry but you have to change that song. It was very irritating while watching your video. Otherwise good video.
LOL about the middle-aged shopper in the way. I'm wondering how much younger than middle age you might be? For men, middle age begins at 36. You just might resemble your joke.  This is my first time watching a video of yours, I really found it useful. Especially the comparisons to the meccas of Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. Excellent understanding of comparing apples to apples. Then with your recipes and encyclopedic knowledge, is a treasure trove. New sub!
I like that you werent just saying "oh this is bad" but have actually looked into it and done the research. And you were honest like the avocado oil, you werent sure if it was bad or not and were honest about it.  Will definitely keep these tips in mind during my next Costco run!
So that's what happened to my lost Costco grocery list!
FYI -  Costco's $5 Rotisserie Chickens Are So Popular, the Company Is Building Its Own Production Facility https://www.foodandwine.com/news/costco-rotisserie-chicken-production-facility-nebraska
I want a Costco hotdog.
You could grow your own spices yourself. They are easy to grow in pots.
Watching your video for the first time, and loved it. New subscriber here 🙌🏼❤️
Omg Costco has the best hot dogs!!  I love how this video seemed to piss people off. 😂  I mean I don’t agree with everything you said. But it was still a very interesting video. I love what you said about the chicken as I did not know any of that. Now it makes total sense! I’ve never liked their roster chickens and have said they don’t taste like chicken. Although I’m use to fresh chickens from a friends local farm.  The vitamin thing was so funny. I’ve had a kidney transplant and my transplant doc has said don’t take vitamins unless it comes up in your blood work that you need extra supplement.
The rotisserie chicken and the organic eggs? Say what!!! you just ruined my Costco vibes...smh. Your explanation about the difference between the European butter and the American butter is wrong because the difference isn't the fat content but the fact that European butter comes from pasture grazing cattle. You can actually tell the difference by the color and flavor. The American butter is pale and mild in taste due to excessive corn and hay feeding, in comparison to the European butter which is made from chlorophyll rich cream. The rotisserie chicken is not priced low because it's unnutritious but because megastores like Costco, purchase in larger quantities thereby passing the savings down to customers. Pricing the chicken low also sells it faster and curbs food waste. Lastly, the sugar and all the ingredients listed on the label are the poultry-brining ingredients.
this would be if chris traeger did yt
I dont know why you came out snobby. You sounded smart, but not all your information is right. I am not attacking you or what. From what you said about organic eggs. That is true chicken has to roam around, but if you know more about the fact, chickens are better in a cage, they are safer. Cage-free chicken tends to fight and they group up. Chickens beat each other up. If you do not believe me check it out and I did research in my university on cage free chicken and cage chicken
This video is so clear (and informative)! what camera did you use?
He says the chickens are cooped up all day and it says cage free right behind him.
I only buy organic, this guy is clueless.
This man is telling you the hard truth about the food that he eats.  Don't hate just because it's too hard to make a healthier change in your life.  Make a small, healthier change whenever you can.  Something's better than nothing.  Remember, it's possible to go even healthier than this:  no cans, no corn items because all corn is GMO, only fresh produce, don't heat olive or coconut oil, heat only grape seed oil, and of course, no meat, no meat products.  LOL.  A Trader Joe's or Whole Foods haul would be nice.  Subscribed!
Nice to know that pine nuts
Cool vid
Before I watched this whole video,  had to comment that dude has a pretentious face. Sorry, I'm sure he's nice though.
Offensive
You’re right about the eggs. I have my own backyard flock that free range and eat strictly organic or Non-gmo feeds. Their eggs are 100x better than any store bought- bigger and darker yolks. Question on frying with the oil blend. Does it leave foods tasting like olive oil?
He is not okay with buying a pre roasted chicken but bacon is fine? Lol. No offense, but he has no idea what he is  talking about.
You're so obnoxious. One day you, too, will be middle aged. I hope people aren't making fun of you.
I don't agree with a lot of what this guy says.
Informative. I may not agree with everything you have said, but thank you for your time in offering your opinion. As for being pretentious, well I don’t see that; some may just be overly sensitive.
Got it.  So if it's cheap, don't get it.  But if it's cheap, get it because it's a great deal.  But if it's cheap, it's bad for you, so don't get it.  But if it's cheap, get it because it's a great deal.  But.....
re: your recommendations: (i) the Mediterranean oil blend:  ALL CANOLA OIL THAT ISN'T ORGANIC IS LIKELY GMO!!!  (ii) the bacon: thick is good, yes, but more importantly, folks need to read the ingredients carefully as it is very rare to find ANY smoked products (bacon, ham, sausages, etc.) that aren't augmented with far too many types of sugars and several really gross preservatives, not to mention the antibiotics and/or hormones the pigs were probably raised on!!  For me, once I learned that pork DNA is approximately 85% identical to human DNA, that alone has pretty much led me entirely away from eating it! ; (iii) you need to do your research before stating that supplements aren't beneficial, and that indepth research is very important, especially when it comes to understanding which supplements ARE of value, i.e. their bioavailability, so in that regard yes, folks can spend too much $ for the benefit they receive!  Because our soils have been severely depleted since the 1940s + the amount of Glyphosate and other chemicals that are now used which severely contaminate our food supply, often even the organically raised crops where "drift" happens from non organic farms who are spraying, it is very challenging to get the required and quality of nutrients from one's food unless you're buying everything from a local farmer who completely organically and regularly amends his/her soil!  Some supplementation is key now!
So you don’t like the roasted chicken but love the bacon?   Confusing.
I found this enlightening as an avid Costco fan! Thank you! (And don’t pay any mind to the meanies in this comment section. Good grief. Why are people such grouches online? If your opinions aren’t kindly constructive in some way, swallow them into yourself and see how you like it.)
So why do you think you are qualified to say we don’t need Vitamins - I actually strongly disagree. The way you just dismissed all the vitamins tells me You still need to learn a lot - and admiring only vitamin C - tells me you don’t know that much - you should of just skipped the aria You-are not that good at. Just keep doing what you good at . I still subscribed.
Doesn't that recommended bacon have nitrites?
By the KerryGold in the silver instead of gold... it's unsalted.
Got salmonella poisoning one from one of those rotisserie chickens.
Some of those items might be cheap but not everyone has loads of money to spend, would it be better to go hungry than buy the cheaper products, this guy is not on a budget, if he thinks that everything is rubbish why does he even go to Costco, but then I don't live in America
Do you work for whole foods? So ,what are you doing at costko????
Couldnt finish it. I tried. If I want to be talked down to, I’ll go to my mothers. Ps telling your viewers shame on them is an awesome way to not have viewers. The chickens are about convince so telling people to make their own, not helpful lol...dude. And telling me I “better be” keto?! You just come across like an “uber” pompous jerk
Those eggs are pretty good. You just have to put some processed salt on them. Good taste, and you just saved $7.00. LOL. People are going to buy whatever is cheapest, and not read the small print.
becawwse, pecaawwwns, he thinks he's the queen of england
I bought rotisserie chickens from Costco on a couple of occasions. The first one tasted okay but the second one was so awful that I ended up throwing it out. Needless to say, I don't buy their rotisserie chickens any more. Yuck! :/ I do love shopping at Costco though :D
I like your video. But do you know that Chinese people have the history of eating pine nuts for centuries? They have amazing quality pine nuts for snacks and cooking.
The ingredients are bad in the rotisserie chicken!
This would be impossible for a family of 6.  I have teens that eat up every thing.  You'd have to spend so much more money just to feed your family using only the ingredients you recommend.
That music is awful
I kind of appreciate the pretentiousness because I strive for a clean diet, keto or not. At least I know his standards are super high so whatever advice I do CHOOSE to take has the green light, and he's probably already done the research that I don't feel like doing.
FYI, I’ve heard that the carbon footprint for getting quinoa is ridiculous.
Btw, everyone is annoyed because they don’t want to hear the inconvenient truth.
I found the info about the organic eggs very interesting! I didn’t know that before, glad I know now!
Thanks for doing costco as they are everywhere there are no auldi's fred meyers and all the other stores here that people ask you to do a video on
Thick cut bacon is gross, don't but olive oil from costco it goes bad before you use it.  I buy my olive oil at costco greek olive oil is best, dont buy almond butter at costco it isn't raw, it is roasted and has salt, buy trader joes raw almond butter. Coconut oil from costco is good buy it all the time, deep fry with peanut oil or coconut oil. Great tips going to check out the super foods you mentioned.
Ñ
Btw, folks, nothing against this guy, but keep in mind that's he's not a physician OR a licensed nutritionist.  Just take what he says with a grain of salt.  I want see CREDENTIALS before I believe medical/nutritional advice from anyone.  And, I don't care HOW many books, articles, they've read on the subject.  Just because someone SOUNDS like they know what they're talking about does not mean that they do.  Would really like it if people who make videos like this to start out by pointing out that they are NOT a physician or a licensed nutritionist and that, therefore, people should keep that in mind.  i'd trust such videos a LOT more.  (But, I'll still check out their info before I take it as"gospel").
I wish someone in Canada would do this video as some of the items you mentioned aren't sold here. I was so suspicious of Costco for so long I wouldn't even buy my own membership and went with a friend instead. I'm glad you mentioned the eggs as I was suspicious of their quality, they are also not very large. It also bothers me that they are packaged in plastic rather then paper cartons. I will not be buying my eggs at Costco anymore. It's worth it to pay a bit extra for eggs from happy chickens. Most Costco products use way too much packaging.  I read my labels carefully. I would never buy a prepared chicken anywhere let alone at Costco. It's quite amazing to me that so many people do not make the connection between rampant cancer in society and food. Cancer aside just general good health depends on the kind and quality of the food you eat. There are no short cuts. Cook your own food from scratch and know the quality of the ingredients you use!
Great advice! Thanks. I never understood why people would take a vitamin that contains sugar and carnauba wax. I'm new to your channel.
jesus pick some better background music.  that obnoxious whistling....
Yes please an Aldi Haul would be great, as I've been shopping there more recently.  Although, this video kinda depressed me:-( lol   I'm not on your level yet man!  But all the info is dully noted and shall be useful as I persevere on this healthy journey!
Thank you for this video.
I was waiting for this guy to get kicked out of the store...the workers don't care or are too busy...
i wish you had talked about the Kirkland canned tuna. I thought that was a good deal for the albacore stuff but it smells bad and looks odd like it was cooked in the can.  The canned Alaskan Salmon on the other hand is pretty decent.
I definitely need that big bag of pirate booty!  I have three kids who snack everyday!  that bag flies even if they don't eat it everyday consecutively
This guy really likes himself.
this guys taking gay to a whole new level.
why don’t you just farm ang eat your own food, we mortals rely on costco to live!
Just found ya... great tips and simplified video. Subscribing
We don't have Costco Stores where I live . No Sam 's Club either.
Just curious about the costco eggs - the display said cage free birds, so I'm confused?
This guys has no idea what healthy food is
Aldis! please
Just so you know....people with Pernicious Anemia cannot absorb vitamin B.  We lack intrinsic factor that processes B.  We have to use sublingual B 12 or injections.  Soooo that means we need that “processed” vitamin to stay alive.  Rest of video was great.
Leave my damn chicken alone!
You need a lot of money for good and healthy goods. How many people can afford them?
Just stumbled upon your video really enjoy the Costco hauls so what oils do you use for cooking and baking and what about flour for baking
Good to know
thank you for this video good thing i just bought my nuts, almond peanut butter and almond flour recently this is a great video is the organic chicken at costco good  i git some drumstick and wings too?
Tip on the spices- next time you & a friend or two are at your market, pick up a brand you like (yes, even if it's a little more expensive) that comes in a glass container (you're paying for that little jar). Then, when you do go to Costco, split the cost of that big container, refill the little glass jars from it and toss it into the recycling. Why glass? Easier to clean, they clean more thoroughly and will last longer. Also with glass, it's easier to remove the previous label, if you so desire.
HEALTH? YOU PROMOTE BACON? LOL
07&#
I agree with most of what he said except the cooked bacon (delish) and a few other things. And once in a great while I just have to have a hotdog. Or two. Not healthy though.
End this dude.  He’s gone too far
Not buying Costco one and go buy the one at Whole Food? Not everybody can afford that. Healthy eating is not supposed to be something that people who are not having high income can't afford.
That was great I didn't know to look at those things
Great video!  Good info and I agree with you on everything.
So wish there was something healthy I could eat at the ready made food section that's not full of wheat, soy or dairy! Totally agree with this list, and esp adding bulk organic greens, and frozen berries, frozen broccoli, squash. I don't really agree that peanuts are healthy- they're highly inflammatory/allergenic and contain molds, etc. are high GMO crops, but the almond butter is great if you can handle it. I find a lot of people can't do almonds and almond flour in that high amount, causes gut inflammation, but in moderation it's good and esp if sprouted it can be a great food! Love the coconut products at Costco too! Wish they provided grass fed/pasture meats locally where I live. Organic coffee is good there too to save! Grinding your own keeps it fresher.
Thank god for gays that have nothing to do and be healthy
Man, you are uninformed about a lot of things.  This is not healthy.
More healthy hauls at both Costco and Trader Joe’s. Need to learn what is healthy and you explain the items so well.Awesome Video🤗
If I ran into this guy and he tried telling me not to buy something I would literally open it and eat it or drink it in front of him. I follow a keto diet but sometimes I want to eat GARBAGE and drink SUGAR water.
I like to buy the Kerrygold butter from Costco when it's on sale and freeze and just use to serve with bread or what not for fancy meals or dinner parties. I get the unsalted Costco butter for everything else.
Can you make a haul video for Aldis and trader joes
A better way is to not eat any animal products period ! ☹️
You complain about the eggs not being "cage-free" and additives in chicken but you recommend bacon? Also do you know cooked olive oil is not gonna be better than vegetable oil?
Organic pine nuts from China lol.
Costco roasted chicken proves once again how easy it is to take a perfectly healthy food like chicken and absolutely destroy its nutritional value, turning it into a worthless, harmful, snack food.
Hi Bobby, good vid, first visit, gonna subscribe.  Quinoa is high in lectins as are peanuts.   Lectins are inflammation causing agents, as I am sure you are aware.  You probably can handle them but many can't.  Peace and Love.
What's with the whistling music in the background?
You are my new favorite!
He's explaining about why not to buy the brown organic eggs, because the chickens are all cooped up in a cage,  then right next to them in the background is cage free eggs, LMAO
"If you're on Keto and you better be"..What a twit. He'll be on the next craze in a few months..Hipster aisle...OMG..Dude..You need a kick in the balls.
I don't know if someone has already addressed this but the chickens are always at the back of the store, they are a loss leader, as is TP, that force you to walk thru the store and hopefully impulse buy.   What better place to be tempted to spend than Costco.   Costco marketeers are geniuses.
you can freeze spices if sealed properly to retain their freshness, and you can also use the machine which takes out oxygen to seal them. If you are saving for a SHTF situation, Cumin would still taste pretty good if stored in these ways (you may have to use twice as much, but oh well).
Stop saying low prices are ridiculous!! Jesus!
“Don’t eat organic, unhappy eggs, but totally kill and eat the actual chicken.” Eye roll.
All things in moderation.
I could not afford to buy all this  crap,I do take vitamins,try to get whole food vitamins.
Kombusha makes me gasy and fart!!! I can’t !😂😂😂😂 thanks for the info lol I get my peanut butter and almond butter there too yummy omg 😮 yes!!!! Plz do a Amazon Haul that would make my life lol 😂
You say don't buy the rotisserie chicken but OK to buy the thighs, where do think those thighs come from, the same chickens they rotisserie? All that coconut oil/milk/cream one day we're going to find out it's really not good for us. I agree with you on nuts, I always refrigerate my nuts..........brrrrrrrrrr.
I'm trying to imagine doing my shopping at a Costco, minding my own business, and having some slickster with a video camera proceed to "advise me" on my purchase without so much as a by-your-leave.    I know what *my*  reaction would be, and I'm not all that unusual.  So I can't help but wonder how many "Nobody asked you, you pretentious jackwagon"s were edited out of this video.
Art looks like my kind of guy!
I have a freezer full of costco nuts. And I like their chicken broth.
Y'all ROCK! HILARIOUS.THANK YOU! I was like DANG, the news about that rotisserie chicken, DEFLATED ME MAN!  I actually cannot wait until I'm able to afford my Costco card again because I had that RChicken first on my list....prior to ur vid!  Funny, like I'm laughing right now. Definitely loved this video and when I am back in there, I'll grab chicken Thighs. Smiles tcs
Wow i did not know that so many things are not good for you. I have found out a bunch of nut butters have sugar in them and I like to eat nut butters with out sugar. But jif natural has been my favortie for the last week. My mom love to buy almond and make her own flour. We go to sams because there is no casco in maine and it would be a full day trip just to get to the closes one that is in mass.
What's the big deal with my gummy vitamins..  only 3g of sugar, plus I'm getting all those vitamins..  yum! :>)
What alternatives would you recommend for those who are on a dysphagia I diet and have swallowing issues for vitamins? I understand that adult gummies aren't the best, but for dad who has issues after multiple brain surgeries, it's kind of difficult in trying to just supplement it with foods. We do our best in giving dad a nutrious meal, however we do supplement with ensure and other vitamin products if possible.
You're worried about the chickens, which is great, but you're buying bacon, I'd be concerned about how those pigs are raised.
I love the chicken!
OMG!!! A sandwich with sliced Costco chicken, slices of Kirkland bacon, GMO tomato from my yard, slathered with homemade aioli made with Costco eggs and drizzled GMO oil. YUM!
My favorite chicken eggs are from my neighbor's hens. They are free roaming and are constantly screeching in fear as hawks and other predator birds swoop in for the kill. They eat worms and bugs that emerge from the soil that was sprayed repeatedly with Roundup. He feeds them homegrown GMO corn and their own eggshells for calcium. just sayin PS-The Costco rotisserie chickens are awesome. For $4.99, I get a huge chicken that is juicy and moist. I shred it for chicken salad, burritos, tacos, and nachos. All are made with store-bought masa that is made from GMO corn. Topped with salsa, onions, etc. from my garden. They grow great and taste even better. However, I did kill the weeds on my yard with Glyphosate and fertilize with 16-16-16 which is a man-made chemical compound.
Very interesting!
Agreed rotisserie chickens are evil at the Costco.
Great post, thanks! I pay 8.99lb for my gluten free blanched almond flour from Nuts.com!
I thought this was helpful, and while I don't agree with everything I do  wish you had shown alternatives for all of them. For example, which protein bars would be a good pick? What about that Kirkland organic butter, would that be okay?
Wow this guy is super annoying.
Fuck you everyone is not rich like you
What's this guy's authority to make nutrition-related claims? Would like to know.
New subscriber, great vid, TY!
new subscriber!!! great video!  Thanks for sharing ☺
costco actually LOSES money on their chicken THATS why its so cheap! its not because its a bad chicken. its a benefit tehy give to their customers
Nope still buying the 🐔😀
At my Costco in WA state, there’s a more humane option of eggs. It’s the Wilcox Free Range $4.59/18 eggs. No, the FDA does not define what free range means. Any company can use that term legally. This is different because farms where the chickens are raised meet the standards of a third party organization called Certified Humane.   It’s worth finding out more. From their website: “Certified Humane® defines Free-Range as having at least 6 hours of outdoor access and a minimum of two square feet of outdoor space per bird.”   That’s a decent standard in my book, and the price is within my budget.
I'm pretty sure you should not fry with olive since it have low smoking point
How can you say the rotisserie chicken is bad. Your daily cornstarch is exactly that modified food starch.
It's sad that you're saying bacon is healthy lol... No animal based product is healthy... Then the video finishes with dude eating a hot dog and Pizza..  yeah ok
lol, vegetable and fruit juice is unhealthy sugar water... but bacon is good? Thumbs down!
🌚
terrible choice of background music, was difficult for me to even concentrate on anything you were saying
The fat you eat is the fat you wear. Bacon is a class one carcinogen in the same category as plutonium and cigarettes so why would you ever eat red and processed meat.
Adults need gummies if they want gummies, where's the law of no gummies over 18? #freethegummies. Thx for the tips tho (Y)
@flavcity, On the eggs it says “cage free” and your saying they are trapped in cages... confused 😟
Aldi blows don't bother doing a video there.
Vital Farms eggs are indeed worth paying double...look for the black label !
Can you do a Sam’s Club one?
I want to see and Aldi haul. I purchase by lookingat sale papers allwlays.
This guy is an opinionated pain
Fab vid, such good information
I wish you could go with me to Costco every time.  Great video.
Coconut oil is definitely worse than canola oil.
Gosh i love this guy! I would feel so safe with him knowing what to buy and eat:))))
Could you be any more pretentious?  Im sure you mean well, but dont be such a snob
Pizza and a hot dog simultaneously! Ewww
Oh man I love gummy vitamins lollll I noticed the avocado oil quality decreased. So sad. :( I did still pick it up. Idk what temperature stable the Mediterranean blend is and a girl is got to cook with something! Lol
Thanks for ruining Costco :(
Excellent video, so informative and helpful! Your channel is like a trip to the library. Thank you so very much! 🌺
kind of a  dik review
Awesome❣️
Thank God I am a vegan and have been for 10 years dont eat butter. I deathly allergic dairy,  eggs and meat. I am currious about Costco.    Can't eat meat though or dairy. Never Been to Trader Joes either. I have been to Earth Fare love it! Alound flour never had it but I am gluton free too
For a "tips" video he's awfully preachy, not to mention spotty in his advice.  Hey, let's decry the sugar and "weird" ingredients in beverages, then praise nut butters that have sugar and hydrogenated oils in them because the price is good!  🙄
Please check the ingredients in the peanut butter. It may have added palm oil or some other oil.  It's difficult to find pure peanut butter.
almonds are the heaviest sprayed nut, so if u not buying organic almond butter and organic almond flour, not good.
Shame on me for bringing home the bacon haha
What a hack! Don't be taken in by his authoritative tone: he's spewing nonsense.
I hate quinoa
Greens are great fiber
Great costco video ... and yes !  vitalfarms to begin with actually taste like a real egg !
Who cares if your eggs are happy or sad if there happy eggs ur still gonna make their moms sad by taking their eggs away 🤷‍♀️
just because gummies have a little sugar in them don't mean im a kid for eating them, some of us don''t like to take pills in any form, so gummies are the difference between me taking them or not. Oh well this guys a kid compared to me lol
thanks for the tips. good to know :)
This is not health. This is an obsession. I just feel bad that this is the type of influence people have when they try to lose weight or eat a healthy diet. These are the type of people who make being healthy seem impossible. If you want to actually be healthy, talk to a dietitian. They are professionals who went to school for this and they know what they are talking about. Many dietitians even have channels here on youtube. Don't trust everything you see on the internet.
How about the premier protein shakes? I buy those at Costco, but is it a good or bad buy? Sure will appreciate your feedback thanks.
my dr prescribes me b-12, c, fersol, b7, a few others but my insurance only pays while i'm in the hospital, the only 3 i feel i medically need is probiotics iron, vit c to absorb the iron. my problem, is back when i was working and keeping up on new medical info probiotics  were listed as yogurt with live cultures, now there are so many diff kinds, i just basically look for ones that are enteric coated so they will survive the stomach acids
I buy a lot of food at Costco because of the good prices but one thing I don't buy is hemp seeds. Actually, I don't buy hemp sees at all any more. As someone with celiac I am concerned about the potential for cross contamination of hemp with wheat. Hemp is often grown in areas that grow wheat and the equipment that is used to harvest wheat is used to harvest hemp. Also, hemp is often stored in the same facilities as wheat increasing the chance for cross contamination even more. The chance of significant contamination is small but worth considering if you have celiac.
Why buy almond butter 27 oz  (1.25 lb) for $9 when you can buy 3 lbs Kirkland raw almonds for $15 and grind it yourself in any food processor.  Same goes for almond flour.  Just don't grind it as long--Voila almond flour.
this is so funny, you don't recommend the organic eggs because of how the chickens are raised or don't drink the sugered-down fruit juices but you DO recommend bacon which is a Class 1 Carcinegen, that's probably worse than the other 2 put together!! And I won't even go into how unhealthy any of that garbage chicken is!!  Sorry, just sayin . . .
What haul!? You shopped at Costco. Hardly a haul. Oh and FYI, vitamins for ppl who don't absorb vitamins thru food based on diet or food restrictions is essential. I know my body.
Please stop the stupid whistle!
God help us to choose the right food!🙏🏼
Oh my goodness I just found your YouTube channel.  I love it!  Thank you for the great tip about eggs.  I buy my eggs now at Natural Grocers.
In my mind I'm Bobby, but in reality i'm Art lol and enjoying it waay too much.
Art is really enjoying his food.😀
cumin lose power? funny
All information are good, I enjoyed video, but I have a question about egg, when you say those things about eggs at Costco I check mine in freeze , on box it written that it is “Cage -free”.did you check that? Please try to answer
Nothing like Costco chicken and salted butter...loved the people who bought the eggs and just ignored this guy! Love pirate bootys! This guy is a HUGE downer!  Because he says so, it’s true?!
Robert Irvine bats are great!
The Suja Uber Greens juice is “packed with” only 6g of sugar
But also if you’re Keto make sure your arteries arn’t clogged... 🙄
Man you i can sure see you live around pavement and concrete walls,you are brain washing your viewers with some false information.
Vital Farms eggs are REALLY expensive.  You can buy farm fresh eggs from pasture raised chickens at your local co-op for a reasonable price.  Vital Farms eggs are quality eggs, but they still have to be packaged and shipped.  My local co-op gets our eggs within 24 hours - very fresh from healthy chickens and we can by them by the egg - pick your  own.  Support your local farms.
awesome video! my only issue being the part about the vitamins, specifically B12. people following a vegan diet cannot get B12, and its essential, so many take it as a supplement. also, as someone who has suffered with near anemic iron levels my entire life, i try to take iron.
Some of his statements are not correct.  1. The organic egg from Costco is actually cage free. 2. Bacon is not good for your health. (Processed meat) 3. "The new version Avocado oil is water extracted from the avocado fruit without the use of harmful chemicals and solvents, much the same way olive oil is made."  https://www.mariannesharvest.com/
Can you do a similar video for BJs?
Have you considered the whole food plant based diet?
Who is this guy.  I love shopping at Costco. I never but Bacon. Because I do not eat any pork stuff.
Please go ALDI
First time seeing this nut, he is too weird, first off he denigrates costcos eggs because the chickens are in cages and right next to them is an egg display for cage free eggs.  Vitamins and supplements are not a waste they are recommended by my Physician , and I will take his advice over Bobby.
No kidding!  You went round telling us the good stuff to buy and now you're eating. ..what???😂😂
Can you do a Trader Joe’s Haul.
Suja juice is not sugar water and it is cold pressed lol the only green juice I’ll drink
Well, nitrates and nitrites in that applewood bacon renders it super unhealthy. You could get the uncured one instead.
Is this guy a dietician? Lots of what he's saying doesn't make sense. The chicken ingredients weren't bad. Kombucha is great for digestion and low in sugar. Thick cut bacon has way worse ingredients than that chicken. The fact that he mentions deep frying at all is pretty ridiculous.
This guy is super annoying.. and you can hear it in every interaction.
I love how you were sharing your knowledge with some of the shoppers. Kinda blows my mind that there are so many that don't care about the quality of their food or how it is raised. I buy the same eggs you do. Because that matters big time to me. :)
Why wouldn't the chicken thighs have all the same hormones & antibiotics as the rotisserie chicken???
Our coconut oil here at Costco in Canada 24.99 man I buy it but 11 bucks cheaper in the states ...   The olive oil should be in a dark glass bottle thankfully we still have the avocado oil you are talking about!
Both of are sexy.
Great information.  There's only one Casco, in my town. Which happens to be on the far east side. I had a Casco membership for a year, I used it twice. It's just hard for me to go that far.  We just  got a Whole foods, here by me.
i don't agree with all your opinions but thank you for the video, very informative!!
Kombucha isn’t good for you ??
just found this intelligent channel
damn i bought that roasted chicken most of the time.
are tj's and wf's items organic, vs Costco non organic?
Hi, love your channel. I would love to see kid friendly foods.
The chicken is 4.99 because Costco sells them to lure customers to buy more stuff and not really making money out of it. That's also a reason why the chicken is always at the far back of the store so you have to go pass so many items that you potentially would buy. Don't make false speculation when you don't really know.
I bet  Costco just love it when this “jumped up know it all” walks in the door..  why do they even let him in the door ??
There are no hormones in poultry in the US by law.
lol huge signs behind him while talking about the eggs that read "cage free eggs"
Enjoyed it and learned a lot.  Like I was deciding today between a 1 egg and a 4 egg and bought the 1 egg.  Live and learn will have to make a lot of baked goods to use them up then.  I like getting the rotisserie chicken at Gelson's, but it's probably comes from the same place as Costco's.
You know so much! I love your presentation style. We are what we eat.
interesting video, but dude that whistling is super irritating!
They let you record this?
Fuck this....those chickens are delicious
You did not look at the ingredients for  the peanut butter... And yes it makes a difference...
lmao that egg bit tho
The prices and selection of an American Costco is always so much better then what we have here in Canada. Very little selection when it comes to organic products and of course our prices are crazy - the rotisserie chicken is $8 , the organic eggs are $12 -we only have 1pound butter not multiple and the organic Kirkland butter only $9 1pound - I just bought the Almond butter few days back - $10 - the coconut oil i recently got $22
I'm watching your video now and I see you're leaning towards the products that are more expensive for that keto thingamajig! Some people can't afford most of the high-quality food; they always go towards the cheap stuff in (I think) everything including food! They always check the food label. Fat and trans fat plus sodium levels are the things which most people look at on top of ingredients. I'm just saying based on what I know and see, I'm not being mean or anything!
Organic eggs at Costco taste better than other eggs.  I dont buy any other eggs either.  Their rotisserie chicken would be a healthier choice than any brand bacon, am I right?
Chickens in US not allow to usé hormones.
My first time seeing you and I loved your video and will follow you.  Best  wishes for your continued success. Blessings, Evelyn
Brazilian sugar water 🤣🤣🤣
There are a lot of claims made in this video, without any facts to back them up. Just out of curiosity, what qualifications does the host have?
Art that was to cute eating pizza and a hot dog love it. Made me laugh
My new favorite channel!
Distracting whistiling music!
Flax seed is great for estrogen for women, and man-boobs for men! Otherwise, great information.
This was SOOO helpful! Thank you!!
Arts in good shape he can afford to eat pizza 🍕 and hotdog
if you buy few ounces of spices from a bulk bin, who knows how long those spices have been in those bins?    love this series though please do more.  And yes include Aldi and Walmart too
this video is so good, i wish someone can do this kind of video in the uk.......
Most of the food there is loaded with preservatives.
Love the honesty, great content,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻.
My doctors have me taking vitamin D3 because I'm deficient. Also, they have me on Red Yeast Rice for my cholesterol, lecithin for my liver and fish oil for my dry eyes. I have Systemic Lupus erythematosus, sjogrens syndrome, hostilities, rheumatoid arthritis and a few other illnesses. If you want to ask my doctors why they have me on these supplements, they will tell you it's because they have read many medical research articles in medical journals. Forgive me if I don't take your layperson advice.
Why did you ignore the white cage free organic eggs next to the brown organic eggs? Aren't cage free eggs what you were looking for? Also, not everyone can afford to eat night priced eggs.
Omg!!! Thank you for letting us know about the organic eggs there
why dont you buy everything from italy,  it guaranteed high quality.  if you want to pay 500 usd for a pair of pants and 200 for pine nuts
As a Costo chicken lover, thx for changing my diet!
Its funny , that u say " the organic eggs " r not healthy ...but you throw a bag of chips in your cart ...Thats ridiculous !
Really good! Yes please do one for all of the stores 😆 Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, etc!!! Really good info!
New to your channel love your content
do a side by side with the eggs.  you said the eggs that are free range taste better?  I dunno.  taste test.  thank for the video....you are cute.
You bash on vegetable and fruit juice then pick up the bacon? Bye.
I disagree about the rotisserie chicken. For starters, CostCo can afford to sell that chicken as a LOSS LEADER (a small loss to get you to come in and fill your shopping carts by the time you get to those chickens, not to mention all the member fees).  The only 3 really 2 things that are really bad for you are 1. HUNGER/starvation, 2. OVEREATING, and 3. If and ONLY IF you suffer from food allergies.   Genesis 2:15 King James Version (KJV) 15 And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.  Genesis 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat. In Leviticus God tells us which animals we can and must not eat.  Acts 10 King James Version (KJV) 12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. 13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.
Thank you... great vid!
"God knows how many hormones are in this [chicken]" -- The FDA prohibits hormones from being used in poultry. Hormones are only used in cattle, and there is no reason to think that hormones used in cattle have any effect on humans.
"When you can't pronounce half of the ingredients..."   smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
Wow...I thought Costco’s organic eggs were certified humane?😳
just because you don't know what the ingredient means does not mean it is not natural or is highly processed, sucralose helps make the sugar content decrease. And things like carrageenan and guar gum are natural they come from trees or seaweed, they are fiber. don't let the name fool you. please do more research to be informed consumer
I would love to see a part 2!
Thanks for enlightening us on smart shopping at Costco, I must admit, I was a sucker for the chicken and the eggs. Could you post a receipe for the biscotti, they looked absolutely delicious.
Really make sense, thanks for the tip!!!
LMAO at 2:20 that lady ironically getting smart balance; doing more harm too herself with that vegetable oil fake butter; Anyone on keto cringe when they say that XD
Can you please do a video for the quinoa breakfast dish that you talked about?  I would like to see how you cook the quinoa.
What juices do you recommend to buy since all of the options you mention are just sugar water?
Walmart has better prices on peanut butter
Costco chicken look like bodybuilder chickens on steroids.
I’d love both aldi and Trader Joe’s
You live in chicago?? Yay!! I'm a new subscriber!!
I agree ....the chickens at costco are slimy and taste like chemicals..
Do a sams club.   Video
He sounds like pretty textbook orthorexia.
He did say it--"In my opinion"
Great video - good info! I believe you!!
no such thing as organic eggs.. Organic products are a scam..
Costco should ban you from their stores.
Costco purposefully made the chickens $5. They are known as loss profit items meant to get you to buy more stuff. You'll notice the station is always placed in the middle of the back wall. Which guarantees you'll walk through one side of the store, then the other. The same is said for their cafeteria after registers, which makes you feel like you've got amazing deals throughout the store.  Please don't provide misleading information, just because you don't understand marketing.
Stop saying baby!! It’s annoying
OMG does this guy have an off button? Between the annoying music and him telling people what not to buy is cray cray.
Nice but you can not add one day to you life.
Lol this shit is funny . Like the video Haha
Loved this! Thank you. I’m a neurologist with some 2 cents-don’t “cook” or heat up olive oil. At an elevated  heat level is can be carcinogenic and directly effect your brain. Better to cook on a high heat with avocado or grape 🍇 seed oil 👍🏻
Thank you!  Pine nuts from China☹️, know I now!  The egg information made me sad!!!!!!  A Whole Foods opened up in my area.  Been wanting to try it, now I will have to visit for my eggs.
Very informative.
Can you post the quinoa breakfast bowl recipe please 😊
I love it...,  can you prepare ALDI tour as well, please.
Costco rotisserie chicken and eggs are the best. I can’t trust this guy. Lol
Great video. Thank you. Is it possible to make a video without the music?
Quinoa is not keto dude
wow, loved this do more plz
can you do one at Wal-mart?
Dang I got everything on the do not buy list. Good information thank you
OMG The nostalgia button you hit when you said thick cut bacon... Grandmoms kitchen in the hills of Western PA when every day started with "slab bacon" lol
I really appreciate this 👍thx a million
My Sprouts sells Vital Farms pasture raised eggs and they are totally worth it! REALLY orange tasty yolks! Kelly gold rocks. TJ's price is pretty good for not buying a ton. I stopped shopping at Costco cuz it's only me and I can't even store, let alone eat, such large amounts of fresh stuff before they go bad.
Because something says healthy does not mean it is healthy. When you buy stuff to cook healthy is how you cook it and what you put on it and as for the pre cook stuff you never know if it is really healthy because you were not there when you cook it. as for your meats you dont know if on the package they are telling the truth like they can say this animal ate healthy and it got to walk around but if you yourself was not there to see if the animal was eating healthy or was able to walk around how do you know if that package of meat or eggs is telling the truth?.
I have a sams club were I am at and when I go to sams club i usually get the stuff I use a lot, drinks or dog treats that my dog eats alot of but once and a while I will treat myself and buy something at sams club that I dont need but I want. I am a tiny skinny person so i dont eat all that much so when it comes to my breakfast stuff or some of the stuff I use for my dinners i get all of that at walmart. Sams club when it comes to stuff to make my small meals with I get crab cakes to bake or i buy some chicken wings and bake them as for snakes I get kind bars, protein bars and some baked chips. Snacks I get a walmart are the snacks i like to eat every once and a while and I buy rice cakes, for my dog at Walmart I get the treats she eats every once and a while the onces that she is soso about and I get her meats to make her food my dog dogs not eat dog food she is on the meat diet and the only thing that she eats that is for dogs is the dog treats that are good price at Walmart is that is made of 90% meat or 100% meat. My word of advice is that when you go to sams or costco only buy the stuff you use alot of and the rest of the stuff you need get it at your local food store.
The label on my cold brew coffee says coffee and water are the only ingredients, is that wrong?
I'm going to have to disagree on the supplements....I work out, eat healthy'ish, but I still have to consume Iron, Vitamin C & Vitamin D! So, that advice doesn't work for every BODY...you should know that!
OMG I just bought those damn eggs yesterday.
Very good video.  Your Costco is not crowded like mine in LA.
Saludos amigo...
I think those almonds are irradiated.
nothing better than dumbass people spending $12 for some "better tasting" "free roaming" chickens! HAHAHAHA
You eat like a high school girl.
The most awkward shake ever, he went straight in for the brotha shake 🤦🏻‍♂️
Needing a Aldi haul
does he only do keto meals now? I loved this channel because he did low carb weight loss meals that didn't include bland typical sweet potatoes, chicken breast, and broccoli. his food recipes was a life save but I am not keto so I miss the old recipes. 😞
You realize they sell their whole chickens at a loss on purpose. It does indeed cost more than 4.99. Also the chicken thighs at costco are the same chicken supplier so.... the preservatives/raising will be the same.
Absolutely amazing information.  Learned so much and agree with you 100% on everything.  You’re awesome!
Miserable man!!! Go away!!!
Great info!
Loved your effort educating customers on the eggs. Good for you!
Go to Walmart have more fun.. best place to work for Costco has so much benefits and start at 14$ an hour here
Thank you for doing this video!  Very interested in a series!
The ingredients on the chicken comes from the seasoning, not the chicken itself.  Have you even looked what’s in your spices at home?
I soo appreciate this video!! I go to Costco and get way overwhelmed with what is really good for you, and whats just marketed to be!!! Thanks for taking the time to educate us!
I love your series, It's very informative and it's helped me no end on my bodybuilding goals, I have been struggling with the same boring meal prep and occassionally cheat meals just because how terrible my food tasted.Since I discovered your channel I have spent a little extra time prepping better quality food (well, frankly not much more time!!) and I have been consistent in my food for 2 weeks now. THANK YOU!!  P.s I wouldn't eat it, but Brian Shaw eats that exact cooked bacon.. Haha!  From your English fan, Mike   (Please keep up the amazing work!!)
Yes! More haul videos!
Thanks for sharing the video of Costco is very helpful for me to see what to buy or not buying thanks the juices from there are not good is very sugary
So the sunflower oil cold pressed is good or not can you tell me please because I cook with that
He's the man of the people! Bobby Parrish for President! :D
Did she shook your high five🤨
Yep so bummed my Naperville Costco no longer carries chosen foods avocado oil😕
I really enjoyed your video.  I've learned a lot. I love costco and I hope you continue doing videos like this.  Could you also do videos on Trader Joe's and Aldis.  Thanks 😊
Aldi’s!  We’re getting a new store and I’ve never been to an Aldi’s yet. Can’t wait!!
How can you go into someone’s place of work and try to make customers shop elsewhere?  Making a video to inform is one thing.  You tried to stop people from buying things there.  If you don’t realize that this is wrong, then re evaluate your fans.
the other thing i would have love to see in this haul is the bag of dates. what do you think Chef Bobby?
Enjoyed watching this. I’m surprised no one came to stop you from recording when you were giving the negative reviews 🤣. Some of the products are quite expensive there. No wonder it is even more expensive here when it is imported.
Trader Joe’s Haul!!
Trader Joe's and Aldi haul, please! 🛒
How often do you go to Costco?
Love this type of video!!!!! Learned alot!!
Hi Bobby ,I'm from saudi Arabia we don't have Costco here ,how to have one branch here ?Bobby I have three boys around your age so you have to listen to me ,ok.I do understand what you want to say and it's true that our bodies don't work like our minds ;by the way I have your mind too but not your body,lol. However,don't you think with me that we deserve to have those goodness in better prices than that.You don't know how much I got angry when you show us that package of pines from Asia ,we don't have that much of pines ,why?
Awesome video, keep them coming
What is wrong with pre-cooked bacon?
Thx for the PSA on the “pine nuts”. I had Pine Mouth once from eating fake pine nuts. It was horrible. Everything, (even water) tasted astringent for 3 days 😱  Please do a Trader Joe’s!
When you dissed the rotisserie chicken, you lost me.
Go Art! 😆👍
This is such a fun and informative video, you have to do it more often. Your knowledge of food products is incredible and thanks for sharing with your viewers.
So interesting....learned alot! Thanks. Would love to see more do's and don't!! 💓✌
Wow..I am so happy that your videos came up on my feed. Just started watching and love them. New subscriber here.. Trader Joe's one next pleaseee!
If you have digestive/mal-absorption issues, eating good may not be good enough.  And you will find as you age, you will likely need to supplement B12 no matter how good your diet is.  As for vitamin D, most Americans are low, even those who spend a lot of time outside. Vit D gummies are great for adults, esp if swallowing a pill is an issue.
The Mariannes avocado oil is water extracted. I think the Chosen brand is as well. Both are refined, for a high smoke point; and both are non GMO.
Aldi haul please!
Hormones have been banned in poultry since the 1950's. The sugars in the ingredients list are probably in the basting sauce or the injection sauce that keeps the chicken moist during cooking. They are cheap b/c Costco buys/sells 60 million a year. Their per chicken profit margin is slim to none and that is why they are only $5 each vs the $6 I pay at my fancy grocery store. https://www.thedailymeal.com/cook/15-secrets-499-costco-rotisserie-chicken-slideshow/slide-7
This guy reminds me of the American Psycho
the ending was amazing.
Awesome informative video!  Glad I subscribed!
I wish we had costco but we don't :( please do aldi, trader joes!!
Very helpful thank you !!!
So helpful!! Ive always bought my eggs here and never knew how poor of quality they were! Im shook!  A good buy I just discovered are the jumbo cans of garbanzo beans! 2.99 for 64oz (i think id have to double check) we like to eat alot of roasted chickpeas as snacks and on salads!
Is Quinoa Keto ?
Loved this.  I agreed with you on many items and learned more on the rest.  Keep making these please!
You telling people to shop somewhere else as they’re shopping there is wrong.  Do you realize that you are costing people’s jobs?  Stick to the recipe videos .  You are part of the problem biw
*TJ HAUL* !!!
interestingly informative....One of the main take always from this is to read labels...Educate ourselves on what we’re consuming...Thanks Bobby
Trader Joe's haul, please😁
You did let us know which eggs you recommend us to buy. Please advice. Love all your videos. Your the best of the best. My favorite chef 👨‍🍳.
You’re rocking my world with the info on the eggs.... but it says cage free. Are they lying?
New subscriber.  Wow, very informative.  Thanks.
Yes, please do more haul videos! We still have the good avocado oil in the glass jar that you talked about -- it's become the only oil I cook with because I like to cook with high heat and need that high smoke point. As a single person living alone, Costco is the only place I go for meats. I like to stock up, freeze in individual portions, and it's nice to know that it's at least somewhat good quality.
There are at least 10 other sites that do shopping videos.  Stay with what you do best, cooking.  Flavcity and mind over munch are my go to for really yummy recipes.
Awesome video!
Really good tips!
Loved watching this! Please do more haul videos, it's been so informative! Would like to see Trader Joe's, Aldi, Wholefoods and even Shoppers or Giant as I literally go everywhere for my food to find the best lol
I would love to see Traders Joe
Great video, a great reminder to stop and look at the ingredients, not the marketing!
This was great and very informative! Especially about the organic eggs. I agree with the oil, my cotsco near Princeton NJ still had the chosen food avocado oil it's all I use for high heat cooking.
Yessss do an Aldi haul!
Aldi and Trader Joe's sounds good 2 me. Thanks 4 the egg info. I always buy those organic brown eggs. I won't be doing that anymore.
Stick with cooking
When you have a lot of money then you can buy whatever you want, when your poor you buy what's cheapest. Sorry, I dont have money to waste on expensive happy organic chicken eggs.
Hi from the 🇬🇧. Such a shame that the Costco stores in the UK don’t carry most of the stuff you’ve shown for Keto. No kerrygold butter although they carry lurpack. They don’t even carry antibiotics free 🥓   I seriously wish they would carry almond fluor as well as the nuts. ☹️☹️
Love this video and breakdown of the buy/ no buy products, please visit the other chains
We needed this! Awesome! Agree with vitamins. Being European we believe vitamins come from food. But when you need them ( and since moving to the States I became Vitamin D deficient!) gummies are the way to go. Everything else makes me nauseous!!! Go ahead! Give me some tips for where I can find vitamin D in food! I won’t hold it against you. 😜 Did I say fabulous job on the video?
Is he allowed to go to Costco and tell people not to buy their products?
This was great! I'd also like to see you do this in other grocery stores! Even if your not on a diet it's nice to know what's good/bad and what you can swap out. Maybe you can do a  "beginners guide" for those of us who may not be on any type of diet and just want to start incorporating healthier items onto their grocery lists or wanting to learn about what items can be swapped out for a better choice. So many of these products are so misleading and it gets so confusing. I honestly never thought a rotisserie chicken was bad!
This was great, thank you!
Need an aldi food haul
Loved this video! I can’t wait to be able to start eating again to start shopping for food.
More hauls! 😉 Thanks for the heads up on the rotisserie chicken, my relatives love it. I tried it once, couldn't get past the texture. It didn't feel like real meat. I thought maybe because it was brined, I can't get past that weird wet, not moist texture of brining.
Trader Joe's Haul please
More hauls plz!
Great vid! Very useful - I liked how you showed how easy it is to buy the wrong stuff due to misleading labeling (eg “organic”). More of this at other stores like TJ, WF, Amazon AND budget friendly stores would be awesome. Lastly - listing info/sources in your description box (eg cornucopia for eggs) also big help! :))
aldi video would be legit!  awesome info it enrages me how crap the ingredients are in alot of "healthy" food nowadays. the companies are just plain deceiving
I’ve unsubscribed now.  You have lost my trust and interest.  Maybe just think a little more of the people who buy bulk to save.  Get off your high horse .  This is life.
He said pecans funny. “Peekonsss”
This was so helpful and eye-opening!
I’m glad you mentioned the rotisserie chicken. If people were to just look at ingredients you’ll know that, that chicken is weird. Also to me, it has no flavor.
About the pre-cooked bacon.... you tell Brian Shaw that to his face, lol... ;)   @3:40=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrhLkLxR1Oc
Yes please! Can’t wait to see TJ and Amazon and if you have Sprouts? My fav store of all time!
Quick question- I’m gluten free and keto but allergic to almonds and peanuts. Any recommendations to the nut butters and flours to substitute? We have Bj’s and Sam’s clubs here in western New York.
What would you suggest as an almond alternative for those of us allergic to almonds?
I have to agree with Art. Costco pizza is delicious (and inexpensive).
Absolutely love your videos!! Please do a Sams club video I would appreciate it!!🤗 Aldo too!
In this video you endorse Cosco  olive oil and say this is what you use for cooking and topical but in a previous  video most recently you endorse NAOOA olive oil?
Great Video Bobby, would like to see more from TJ's and Sprouts, keep it going along with your cooking vids, Thank You..
Terrific video!!!
OMG I buy fully cooked bacon all the time, why is it wrong?
I would like to see Trader Joe's and Whole Foods.  Thank you, this video was very helpful.  I didn't know their price was so great on quinoa!
Oh wow. I never realized you were from Chicago and I've been subscribed for so long. I'm from the northwest suburbs. 😁
Brilliant video! Australia has only had Costco in the last 2 years and we have Aldi.  Our Costco have similar products as the US. Learnt so much. An Aldi video would be great. Again, similar products at Aldi US and Australian stores.
Hey, can you do a TJ’s haul please? !
14:12 I was gonna say, where’s the pizza? That’s an essential healthy food! 🍕
Man, never thought about the rotisserie chicken! I usually look at labels, too!  Guess I'm so programmed in buying 'em.  Also, thanks about the tip about the eggs!  Definitely gonna think twice about my Costco purchases.
We don't have Costco in my country, but I watched anyway and still learnt so many amazing tips. :D
That ending was hilarious! 😂
Haha, we always have family dinner at Costco when we go. This video made me so nervous. I was convinced a Costco employee was going to show up at any minute. LOL Thanks for doing this. I got so excited the first time I saw the Almond Flour there. It's a great price. I enjoy seeing what different Costcos offer around the country.
Thank you so much for this informative video. Can you explain further why corn fed chicken aren’t considered organic ? This is so scary.  Would love to see an Aldi haul like this .
Loved this video, please do an Aldi haul!
This was fantastic! I agree with everything you said about food origins and how things are processed. I also like how you aren't afraid to call out the hipsters! Haha Great job!!
Great tips
Heehee...loved the kombucha comment. Kombucha has actually helped me a lot! I was having it every morning and getting drunk on on an ounce! I thought I was reacting to the alcohol, since I'm sensitive, but I realized that I'm also sensitive to fermented foods! Thank you kombucha!
I’m not use to him stepping outside of the kitchen. LOL. 😆
This is awesome! It might be nice to see a review of BJ's Wholesale and Sam's Club. Both have online inventory to browse through if you don't have one in your area. Sam's Club has Olivari cold pressed Avacado oil 7.99 for 34oz.
Aldi haul!!!
Great video, please do more grocery haul videos. Really appreciate the insight, so informative! Thank you
🤣🤣🤣 Costco gonna kick you out for talking bout their eggs.. love the video.. this is Natasha From Yonkers
Trader Joe’s field trip would be fun ~
Loved the video! It's super helpful because I'm planning to check out Costco soon. And I'd definitely love to see more grocery haul videos.
Absolutely love your hairstyle in this video! And the outfit!
This was the best haul video ever. I love that it was not the typical look what i got haul.
I love you vlogging! Eventhough you burst my bubble with the brown eggs, still a great video.
Hauls from anywhere!
This was so informative. Please do more of these!  For every store- Aldi, Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods. I have watched a lot of Costco haul videos of supposedly “healthy” hauls and this was the first video that was original enough to explain why the eggs and rotisserie chicken aren’t so great there. Are they the worst thing in the world? No- but they are your best options.  Some people just don’t know know the difference and what you are doing is teaching them- thank you.
Love it! So many wonderful ideas, and love the tip about the rotisserie chicken. I will pass that tip or one to my friends and family. Yes, I would love to see an Aldi and an Amazon hall. It will be so beneficial. Trader Joe’s would help also. Thanks for the informative videos!
😆 I’m happy Costco didn’t throw you out ... thank you for sharing 💙💙💙💙
Great video I would love a Trader Joe and Sprouts haul
Thanks for the pine nuts information .
Kudos and five star to you .
Omg I cannot wait to pick up chia seeds!!!!!
Yes- an Aldi haul would be fabulous- keep up the great work!
the shit about the roasted chicken is just that yes there are better ways like cooking your own but the additives that he talks about are in the spices or are spices, there is nothing wrong with them for a quick meal for yourself or family as long as it is not all the time
Thanks for the tips Bobby, more video like this please👍🏻🙏🏻
Have you made keto pasta?
I can’t believe you did that in the egg section smh
Thank you so much for this video! It is so helpful!  I had no idea about spices. Gross about the pine nuts! I stay away from fresh garlic from China too.
Awesome! I would love to see more haul videos. Helps so much. I do my own research but its hard to keep up on it all. So thanks!
Number 1 reason to skip most of the Costco vitamins are they're synthetic and not bio-available, so your just wasting money. They do have a couple supplements I like, just be mindful of the ingredients.
But... the pirates booty is so tasty 😫
Magnesium is a good supplement to take if you’re on Keto diet. It significantly helps with lessening keto flu symptoms.  Great video Bobby 👍🏻
Wish there was a shop like this in germany.
What about quinoa breakfast bowl recipe?
"Acai = Brazilian sugar water" Me: thanks for the tip!
Please more hauls
Please more hauls!!
Samsclub please
Wow I never thought about the rotisserie... thanks for the tip
You’re the man! Cool vid. Can you do  a healthy sous vide recipe video please since everyone else only does sous vide steak videos 🤦‍♂️? We need your creative take on this since your food recipes are amazing 😉.
I would love to see a TJs and Aldi haul as well... the good and bads... what to buy and what not to buy! Great Costco video!
I'd love an Aldi video too. Sam's Club would also be wonderful! (Different music though...it was hard to listen with the sing song background music in this one 🙂.) This was a great video - especially the ending! Thanks!
Is this going to be a series? I really hope so. So much to learn.
Absolutely love your channel. Could you do a video like this at Sam’ Club and Walmart? as I don’t have a Costco or Trader Joe’s in my area. Would also love seeing an Amazon shop
Hi Bobby. In the tiny towns I live in and by, we only have Kroger, Wally World, and Meijers. I so want to go to a Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, and Costco.
Leave the B vitamins alone 😅
So helpful! 🤗
I'm super excited about this!
Can you do a What to buy:Not buy Aldi edition? It would be most helpful. I am interested in TJ and Whole Foods but they are an hour away and wouldn’t be very cost effective to shop there.  Also do you have a video on cookware and how to pick out ones that are good quality ?
Love your channel, I would love to see an Aldi haul from you.
I can't stop laughing, he had both hands full of food. lol
My question is how do you shop for ONE at Costco since size is so big and I do not want to eat the same thing all week or have a party.
I’ve been waiting for this video since I discovered your Chanel! Can’t wait!!
Cant wait to see the video!!!
