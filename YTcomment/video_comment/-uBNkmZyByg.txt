I hope you enjoy today's video with Juanpa! What's your favorite frozen dessert? 😊🍦🍵💕
I wonder if she knows she collaborated with someone who stole money from the victims of an earthquake less than a year before this vid was uploaded.
I loved the video! I wanna try that, just without teas or coffees for the flavor.❤❤️❤️❤️❤️ Do you think you could do something BTS inspired at all?🇰🇷💜👑♾️

Hi
anyone else rewatching this while wishing they had little moons
anyone else here in 2021 when these are now a huge thing
Such fun Rosanna! You've grown up, everything is upgraded!  But your personality is still so sparkly. Watched one of your videos almost 7 years ago, the Rainbow Unicorn Cake which I had made for my daughter when she turned 5.  The kids absolutely loved it.  Am going to try your Mochi recipe too.
1:30 We met by,  Ro: YouTube  Juanpa :  Tinder
The Spanish music that intensifies when zooming in on Juanpa  s e n t  m e

Tapioca starch is better. Adds a lol sweet to it. IJS.
Hi juampa
No entiendo nada
to normal people mochi = mochi to ARMY's mochi = Park Jimin
That's ice cream Mochi..
Girl your kinda old to be having minors on your channel
No Jimin in the comments section... im sad
._.
At least learn how to say mochi😐!!!!!!!..bcz thats our beloved park jimin's side name💜
The reason why mochi dough is sticky is because it's made of rice mixed with water and pounded or in some cases, they use glutinous rice flour.
is it ok if i replace potato starch with corn startch??
Everyone: watches video normally   Me: hmm he looks like he is mature they would be really cute together
I just got a mochi ad, coincidence i think not.
I love mochi to

Who's watching this video because it has Juanpa from Brent Rivera's videos and his friend's vids?       also came for the mochi :)
I love this collab
I don't necessarily like lele and her "clan" by juanpa and his voice really got me like 🥴

Juanpa: Wiz khalifa the dry                                       Me:He‘s dry?
I felt like he was a little too friendly
The part that he says *BOOM* at the end is so funny 😂 XD
You car so cool and do you stand om a stand to new tall
Asians that not mochi
I love  mochi
make fluffy pancake
The extra gluten is what makes the rice sticky, that's why it's also called glutinous rice flour when in this form
Me think of Jimin as the mochi:👁👄👁
Ro and Juanpa are such a good team.
I like how he just kept chomping down on his teeth lol
Your a Rofessional baker (get it 😉)
1:29 omg but why was Ro trying to look away xD like it was true or something
Chim Chim would have loved to make this with you ro 🥺🥺🥺
Wow my favorite video congratulations Ro
Holy mochi-

Omg I love Juanpa's accent who else?
Omg I’m Mexican too and I started laughing so hard because of ro’s Spanish 😂😂😂
Juanpa:let me take my ring off  Ro:yea take off your ring  Me:RING EHAT IS HE ENGAGED?   😂😂😂😂😂😂
Don't be heating on me but I think ro has a crush on juanpa
She's like the sweet cousin or aunt that is always fun to be around

Normal people when thry think of mochi: Food  Army: Jiminie??
7:46 Juanpa: *POKE*
Jimin has entered the chat (If your a bts army, you'll understand)
I never expected that-...
Juampa=my friends Rosanna=me  Height (Sorry for incorrect spelling)
Please make another mochi recipe please...
Why is this so cringy and awkward... i just came here for the mochi recipe and now i'm cringed af
I love jumpa. Sorry I spelled it wrong
7:54 My sister was watching this and i came over to watch it at this time and i thought it was gruacamole
i just google searched mochi is from china *corona virus
i love japanese deserts like mochi
The first thing I remembered seeing the word mochi is Park Jimin (baby mochi) from BTS
I love Moche to
that was an. interesting intro.
These two are so positive
Juanpa in thumbnail: 😱😲  Ro in thumbnail: 😀☺
Rosana: do you need an apron  Juanpa: what’s an apron?   Me: content😎
Honestly, Juanpa is a whole mood
ok but they’d be perfect if they ro didn’t like girls
Anyone who is thinking of jimin
J:"serca" r:"sgha.did I say it right"j:*looked dissapointed at camera*."yes"
Oh the mochi looks tasty
He is on tv
Juanpa : I won't be able to take out our pasta Ro: * is confused *

At Walmart, I buy this mochi that’s mochi strawberry ice cream! It’s delicious! 😋 ❤️🍓
Why do I lowkey ship them💕😊🤭
Why do I lowkey ship then ngl 💕🤭
I honestly find it amusing that they think normal mochi has ice cream in it
You call yourself a baker and you call sieve Si-ve No! It’s Siv ha
I think mochi ice cream is asian because I think mochi is from Asia plus ice cream = mochi ice cream
Ro: mochi  Me:omg ro is cooking jimin 😮😮😮😮😮
en realidad tortilla viene de una lengua indígena que significa tortilla doblada no tiene que ver con queso que yo sepa pero meh les dejo el dato ahre
I got really happy when they said "Empezemos!"

Juanpa: “I think you’re mexican”  All mexican people: “Ni mais pongala a tomar salsa como agua y ahi vemos” (translate: “no way put her to drink spicy sause as water, then we’re talking”)
Ro: “We got green tea ice cream”  Juanpa: “oof”
Luis Miguel’s life is so sad and hard you really should see it
Yo soy mexicana y me estoy atacando de la risa por lo de quesadilla (im mexican and im laughing soo hard because of the quesadilla thing)
Juanpa is Hispanic and doesn't know how to cook??? UNHEARD OF!! I myself are Hispanic and know how to cook, my mom wouldn't let me live if I didn't! Lol

They would be a cute couple lol maybe
I love that he just wants to bite everything😂
Normal people: OMG making mochis!!!!!  BTS FANS( Including me) : OMG NOO PLEASE DONT EAT PARK JIMIN PLEASE DONT😭!!!
Rosanna. "We met on YT" Juanpa. "Tinder.... wait what?"
Is roe wearing heels 😂❤
fact i think mochi is not really ice cream in japan it is just like red bean but not ice cream
One time my brother was eating mochi and he let it sit in his hand too long and I got super sticky it was like melted slime
After they made it juanpa was always watching the mochi
They’re like siblings i love it😂
Ik I'm late but O smell A SHIPP
Can she reach the microwave....
7:14 the moment she realized what he said
8:55 whats an apron?
I like how Rosanna is one a step stole

That Aloe Vera plant in the back looks like me on mondays     On non quarantine days.....😬

*Me slowly crying cause i know i cant eat this cause i'm Lactose Intolerant*

3:51 its sounded like she got into a stool. Heyy I'm watching this is 2020 and its amazing.
Not trying to be rude but, how does Ro reach her microwave?? 😂💀
Why dose he act like a 6year old it’s fine but he always act grown up
😂 I love when he said a kid couldn’t survive in this and Ro started wiggling her arms acting like the kid
I love emoji everybody thinks it’s weird so good!!🤤
Juanpa: suavesito   Me: Despacito
"oOooohhhH Its a cupcake tray" *DSKS*DNED

Did any one notice that in 9:54 instead of shake she said something else 2020
Nobody:  Ro:"me and my girlfriends love this stuff I've got rainbow banana strawberry
Who else is thinning that they would have been the cutest couple ever
I love mochi 🍦🍚

I really sowwy husky but... why do I ship them so much. They are just so funny together and it’s really sweet! I wanna see more videos with him in it! Love you Ro💕
Juampas facial expressions are everything
Now a days you won't touch the food your mother made cuz of the Corona :>
Rosanna:Do you want a apron Juanpa:what's a apron     That shows he does not know how to cook
Mochi is rice cake with a red bean paste filling that is a traditional desert in Japan. Ice cream mochi is American
Ro is so short compared to him😂
Me too I love love mochi ice cream green tea

Damn he is taller then her 😂

Legends say that to this day juanpa still doesn't know what an apron is
Juanpa!!!!!
Him:The show is about Louise Miguel  Me:o damn I legit just thought you were saying my bf is in a movie his name is Miguel and I didn’t hear the Lois part until now lol
Ok is it just me or does anyone else think his accent is so cute like

When the espanards went to the Philippines we learned a little español
Where can I get the ingredients
Is ro on a stool
Look at the size difference 😂😂
Who else is dying over his accent? 😍
The height difference is funny
I'm assuming u can substitute any flavour of ice cream with this recipe, correct me if I'm wrong
This is how Jimin was born *
Ship
Lmao she is flirting like crazy
Nooooooooo Microwave
Juanpa was having a mini stroke looking at all the ingredients

Queso (I spelled it wrong) and cheese to me are two different things

Where can I buy sticky rice flour?
Watching your videos is like watching dora and diego cooking
Empezemos means "we start" ....
I feel like he kinda has a crush on her😂 And in my mind I think she is like a mother teaching her son how to cook🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m going through a million mochi videos to find one that doesn’t have people talking about Jimin
the actual video starts at 3:59 and they eat at 13:22
Juanpa: Can I slap it? *Juanpa slaps it* Juanpa: ok! Me:dies of laughter*

Is Juanpa maride because I was just wondering or is it just fashion 💍👍👎
That's was a surprise I wasn't expected that I love him woo 😍
Ive done this one and everyone who had never tried this should try!! The most non dangerous food ever been created to do with kids 🤣 Warning : never even thought about adding more "sugar" eventhough u make the original mochi...it was...VERY sweet according to cute Ros recipe  Ps:Ive made this with green tea KitKat from Japan so it was 0% of sugar and it was perfectly balance with this recipe ^^ luv u ros ❤️
Juanpa is so adorable 🥺🥺
7:37 Juanpa's face as he says it's just "a little hot"
Mochi tastes great
Park jimin Bts stans where u at  💜💜💜 Moch.ChimChim.Chimmy.Jiminie💜
Juanpa: If a kid fell into this they wouldn’t survive Meh: Really? I’ll eat it all!!!!
It’s called sticky rice/flour because there is no English equivalent to the Chinese name
13 minutes and 53 seconds of Rosanna being the smart mom, and Juanpa being the lost child looking at ingredients like they are going to attack him
2030 anyone ?
My favorite dessert is leche flan
3:51 i love how she goes on a stool 😂
Is Juanpa really tall or is Rosanna really short? 😂
*Lele Pons has entered the chat*
Please tell me everyone say ro step on the step stool
THIS IS MY FAVORITE VIDEO OF HERS. MOY BUIEN!
Mochi doesn’t normally have ice cream though. So this is specifically ice cream mochi not regular mochi...
Ros videos with guests are clips of her cheering her friends on to do the simplest tasks.
I love how she is so small she needs a stool🥰
Ro is on a step stool
.
The slight Spanish accent of Juanpa is so funny xD I'm dying

I love his accent and how childish he is, my fav part  Ro: and you wore all black, do you need an apron?  Juanpa: what’s an apron?  Ro: *am I gonna explain?, nah* we don’t need it
I know Spanish cause I'm Puerto rican
It looked like pancakes gone wrong lolol
3:02 is when they start making the mochi you are welcome!

I would honestly ship juanpa and inquisitor master because they could actually speak in spanish to each other.
Green tea ice cream is my favorite ice cream

3:53. To sounds like she’s getting on a step
I love how ro steps on a stool😂❤️
Omg my mouth is watering 0ㅇ0
I love your dress!!!😍❤️
2 of my favorite ppl made a video with together
They are making jimin
Can you make mochi without rice flour
Your wrong even if the ice cream is big you can still wrap it in the mochi because I saw a video with giant mochi
3:25 that oof
Am I the only one who cringed a little
1:37
Where do you get your clothes they are so cute love you and I love to cook two☺️😍😇😘
When Juanpa said, ‘Órale!” I died 😂😂😂
No entendi casi nada pero me encanto el video XD jajajaja
3:51  I did not know that😶
I wonder what ur Husband Or Boyfriend would Think if Calabed with lots of Boys/ You tubers
Me and my cousins tried it, we made vanilla and strawberry mochi
Juanpa is taller than rosana
Did anyone realise that ro is on a stool XD!!
Can you make honey comb because mochi really reminds me of asmr
Correction: ice cream mochi  Mochi: bean paste in rice dough
6:54 Rosanna:PRO  Juanpa:PRO Rosanna:PRO  Juanpa:PRO  *microwave stops* Juanpa:Ro Rosanna:PRO Juanpa:Ro! Rosanna:PRO Juanpa:ROSANNA! Rosanna:Juanpa if you kept on yelling we couldn't have herd the microwave! Juanpa: ;-; OH! IM SORRY! Rosanna: its ok now lets mix and put it back in the microwave!  Juanpa: @_@
You are cool on escape the night
SHE CALLED HIM BAE!!!!  ✨🌺🌷🍒🌸🍓🌹✨   AT 5:54
Mochi
Juanpa and Ro look like long lost siblings!!!
Can you make a Eiffel Tower cake
Holy machine a new word
I wish juampa will always in rossanna's video
I think what you made was mochi ice cream and not just plain mochi. I think plain mochi is the outer casing of the ice cream. I am not expert though😂 Either way good job y’all are so awesome love you Channel
When ro stepped off her stool I was like oooooof
‘Did I say that right?’  *Camera zooms to Juanpa’s face*  ‘Yea’ Me at home: Nope, no you didn’t!😂 Also me: *Dying of laughter* I loved this video!🥴💛
He's so cute.... But so stupid at the same time
Juanpa is fav so now I sub
Hi Rosanna I’m a big fan and I just want to ask if you can make crepe cake because it’s my favorite dessert but I don’t know if it’s an frozen dessert
When is your birthday Ro
You guys kind of match❤️❤️❤️
4:51 For the one who play fortnite  *when u try to snipe someone and u are a deafult like me*
Be careful with the ice cream Someone maybe licked it  Stupid trend...
I'm Hispanic to look - pretty vonito  or vonita
You know Mochi is made out of rice and then pounded to a sticky dough
Where did you get the sticky rice flour
Love you Ro but what where the measurements  for the doh part? I really like Mochi so can you please tell me the measurements. ❤️❤️❤️
Nobody:  LITERALLY NOBODY: ME: FoR SoMe ReAsOn I ShIp ThEm!!
Jaunpa this is a message for u DATE LELE PONS AND BR HER GIRL FRIEND
Lele! Juanpa cheating on u 😂
Am I the only Mexican one here that can understand juanpa
3:52 she step on a stool
I love that Rossana Pansino is so short that she needs a platform for her to make her look more taller! Lol (not being mean I'm just saying)
I mean to I can help you with Spanish 😇
i understand everything
Not trying to be mean but u don’t add ice cream
mochi!
This is the first time that I realized that Rosanna stood on a stool.
You're pretty
HOLY MOCHI 😂😂💕
The ice cream they used doesn't exactly tastes like a classic green tea. But there are diffrent ones you can find in I believe any asian market. In my opinion the Halo top one tastes like hair spray. Advice👌
i don't know but jaunpa is being wired like he dose not not know what to do
Ro your Spanish is excellent 👌👍
It's like edible Tar
3:40 there was a frickin full freezer of ice cream....that’s like...a dream!!
"How do you say great?"   "Despacito."     "... That's 'slowly', isn't it?"   "Yeees."
“Holy Mochi”    That killed meh
Nobody : Me: omg he is so cute
I went to google earlier and apparently Rosanna is 4'10......i thought she would at least be my height or even taller
I came for the mochi not for Juanpa bc.....he kinda scares me👀
Anyone else notice Juampa say. “Oof” At 2:26
I was just wondering if it has to be sticky rice flour or if you can use normal rice flour?
Juanpa: Can I slap it ?🙂 Ro: *confused silence* Juanpa: *slaps the mochi*    Ro: giggles
Mochi
Quesadilla dont come from queso Google it
He is sooooo cute!!!!!
Ro: how you say great? Juanpa: despacito  Me: did I hear that right? 😂*replay*
Juanpa is 22  Ro is 33  But juanpa is way taller than ro
Pro-pro-pro-proreillyyyyy microwave parts .....ow
Who else realized the cinnamon roll stands on a foot stool😂😂😂
I can cook
I knew how to make mochi but not the ice cream mochi. Thank you!
Anyone think there a cute couple

Ro: we met on YouTube   Juanpa: Tinder... wait what     Me: 🤣🤣😵 ahhh I’m dead

Juanpa: we was like walking dead  Me: 😂😂😂😂😂
Juanpa " thank you for the hug!"
I did now the  quesadilla word
Omg Rosanna Pansino I was watching Nailed it and I saw the episode that you are on. FYI I was screaming.
juanpa's a better Spanish teacher than my actual teacher
How do you Say Great?  Despacito Isn't that Slowly?  yes
1:30-1:31

Hola como están yo habló español.
M-OH-CHI good lord you say it wrong every time also this is ice cream mocha traditional Moche doesn’t have ice cream in it
I don't know why latina boys are having that face 😎 I am latina and my friends are having the same face😂😂😂
JIMIN MOCHIIIII 🍡🍡🍡🍡
This was 4 days before my bday.
Im an army but everyone who mentions jimin is so cringy.
It bothers me h ok w thry are saying "mochi" when they are really making "mochi ice cream" mochi is NOT typically made with ice cream inside of it. That is a completely American thing. Typically it has red bean paste inside and it's not cold. It's a neutral temperature
Am I the only one who saw that thing in the back of her
Juanpa: blaaap  Me: LOL his face is so weird
Lowkey they look like a cute couple 😂
Can you try to cook crepe cake??
Ekkkkkkkkkkkkk I love zuanpa alot and his cines took 😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍💖💖💖💖
I love your food
It sounds like Juanpa is sick
Wow can we just talk about how she can cook with a tight dress on
When this ended I was mad, I WANT MORE!!!! You two together, I want it always
Ro:wisk it together Juanpa:wizkhalfia da dry  😂😂😂

Umm excuse me, Ro can you be my BFF?? (im an addict to sweets...)
You and juanpa would be a relly cute cuple

Can u give me some jimin *urg* i mean mochi please
He porphorms which Lele pons
Hey! Ik a rlllly easy way to make Mochi! It’s a TINY bit tougher but it tastes good.  Flour  Sugar  Soy milk/almond milk/coconut milk Vanilla essence- optional  Use equal amounts of everything (unless you want less sweet, then half the amount of sugar)  then add vanilla if you want  Put it in the microwave for 3 mins then check, repeat, etc.  To check, use a a chopstick for eg make sure it’s no wet. But not hard to poke xx
“Kingkong booger”
8:57 omg Juanpa lol!

Mochi ice cream is an american thing .-.
I subscribed!!!
My dogs name is mochi
hi
Omgggg she’s on a step stool 😂😂😂 I can’t
I just think that rossana is standing on somthing
What makes it sticky? Mochi is made out of glutinous rice which is stickier and denser than regular rice. Perfect for desserts. My favorite is also green tea mochi followed by dark chocolate truffle mochi
Never had mochi but this makes me want to try them lol
Juampa
U should contact Joey I’ll have my assistant have Joey put jumps on escape the night
I’ve been craving mochi I’ve never had it but I rlly wanna try it 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓😉😉😉

Who else thinks Juanpa is so freakin cute?
At 3:52 you can see that Rosanna steps up on a step stool. And why does he have a ring in the spot where you put your wedding ring?
Did u here the '' oof'' that he said at 3:24

Nice a Japanese treat finally somebody doing good something different yay💖😊😀
The fact she has to use a step stool she’s so short
*goes out and buys Mochi ice cream* DONE I MADE IT lol
SAS -ASMR AND RO SHOULD DO A COLLAB
Halo? That’s not how to pronounce it..
They would make an awesome couple😃like if you agree ☺️
anyone else come bc “mochi” was in the title and thought of jimin?
Lol they are making Mochi,where is our Mochi aka Jimin😂
*green tea mochi* Me: JIMIN?
I know! I am watching this on 2019 but can u have a colab with lele pons?
You haven't truly made mochi from scratch until you do it the traditional way - pounding it with a mallet. I had to do that with my Japanese class and it was a workout and a half... Fun though! Also for the reason it's sticky, mochi is made out of a glutinous rice that grows in Asia and has high level of amylopectin. The more you know!
Is it just me or is she standing on something to make her look taller
Juanpa is giving me some serious Cole Sprouse vibes 😍😂
Rosanna pansino 🤔do u think that juanpa is cute😮do u like him
:v it stuck to my hand

I tried this recipe and it didn’t work the first time because I couldn’t find rice flour so I used regular flour so don’t do that but then I got sticky rice flour from amazon and it worked perfectly thx Ro I have always wanted to try this and it was DELICIOUS also I made strawberry flavor using strawberry extract Incase you wanna make a different flavor and you can’t find a powder
The title should have been Juanpa being adorable.for 13 min and 12 sec
I like how she stepped down I was oh she short

SHIP JUANPA AND ROSANNA
.................i ship it sorry husky
For anyone who wants a review of the recipe-  It was def mochi but personally I like it sweeter so I would add double or triple the amount of sugar otherwise it was good!  But maybe it's just me but that Halo green tea ice cream tastes super gross I'm glad I got another flavor too for variety bc the green tea flavor tasted really strange? So definitely make sure to get an ice cream flavor and brand you like!
Omg
I think Juanpa and Inanna Sarkis would be a good and cute couple
I watch u all the time Juanpa I watch you with Lele,Hannah and Twan
Omg he doesn’t know what an apron is #IloveJuanpa
Juanpa is like me "What's an apron" that's litterally me when baking with my mom lol but I live you so much you make my day! 😃

Pensacola Alabama they could have you sugar paste instead of fondant look as fondant taste disgusting sugar page source is like sugar I had sugar paste once I'm in love with it they give you sugar paste
Moche when I went to Pensacola and orange beach and they're made out of fondant and ice cream the ice cream was good but the van that was absolutely disgusting but I like the idea that they're making it out of the rice krispie treats or whatever because you can barely ever taste the fondant but cuz it arson have our crispy treats it just was like gross like

I NEED A FREEZER STOCKED WITH ICE CREAM LIKE ROSANNAS 🍦🍦🍦
It's amazing that not a Japanese like you make matcha mochi ,using matcha ice cream. Matcha has much vitamin C and  so many good effects something like   relaxing, stress free, aromatherapy,bactericidal effect,  odor eliminating effect for everything, espesially for your mouth,  beauty skin, diet, constipation etc.
RO PLEASE DO A COLLAB WITH LOGAN PAUL!!!
rossana looks like a MOM
Ship it
Juanpa is my spirit animal.
How do you always look so bomb, like I would look like a squashed bean
"What's an apron?" Aw 😂

Ro saying “let’s get started” in Spanish is me when a teacher explains anything
Can you do the Korean mozzarella corn dogs please!! 😩❤️🤩💞

Damn, if you’re army you know why I’m here

as i clicked on this video i was wondering how many jimin related comments there were going to be. well my prediction was correct and there was lots. btw im army as well so when i saw the video i immediately thought of jimin
2:34 - 2:37  dying
I love how Ro is on a stool but it is still 1 foot shorter than Jumpa
Can u do more videos with jaupa
Rosanna
What’s a apron 😂😍😍
This isn't traditional mochi. This is called ice cream mochi. Clickbait.
That’s not mochi. Mochi is the sticky outside part. (Btw I live in Japan so I would know)
I wish you do a video with lele pons
Omg Juanpa does vines😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Rossana: do you want an apron  Juanpa: what’s an apron  Me:😂😂😂😂😂
I watch him in the vine vids I watch is one of my fav😊😊😊
I need to add potato starch -Juanpa 😂
Jaunpa: "it stick to my hand" Ro: "how much" Jaunpa: "I can not move" I'm so dead😂
I watch you when I was 5 year old
Hi I love your vids
I ate green mochi the second you did I also know Zuanpa
Excelente me encanto!! I'd loved it!!! I'm Latin too
Juanpa is so childish in a good way
Watch out Zuripons fans we got Raunpa 😂
YO ESTOY VIENDO LA SERIE EN TELEMUNDO ESTA BRUTAL
i love mochi
“im gonna try halo for the first time inside oUr mochi” oml his accent when he said that😻😩

Can BTS army stop?! Jimin has nothing to do with making mochi.
Do with Lele pons
8:56 *wHat’S aN ApROn?*
U guys would be cute as a couple
Can't believe i met juanpa at terminal 2 today he has a really bright personality. Really funny guy. Awkward conversation tho. He didn't know what 'expensive' mean when i told him he was buying an expensive food lol. He spoken english really cute haha.
OMG JUANPA!!!

Try to bake with Lele Pons💗, Like if u agree
I have never had Mochi. I get jealous when I see people eat it haha! I would really want to try it some day.
Omg she is really small
I actually love Mogi
Juanpa is literally my future ex husband 😂
Ro: Do you need an apron, or are you okay?  Juampa: *Whats an apron?* Ro: ..We dont need an apron, okay lets go

While reading the thumbnail, it said Mochi and I instantly remembered jimin from BTS 😂    So I decided to watch this video and it was pretty entertaining
I put the subtitles on and when Juanpa said Tinder the subtitles went: tender. Omfg I'm dying X'D
How do you not know what a apron is

How can someone be cute speaking "Ai"? So adorable!!!
The title reminded me of Jimin SCREEEEEEEEE
I love mochi

Jimin oppa?
I thought of Jimin while watching this video.
This is the collab I didn't know I needed in my life.
I know this is random but does anyone remember her song  Edit: It was called 'Perfect Together'
I love this vid
you should make stretchy ice cream
KING KONG BOOGER Me: LITERALLY DYING HAH
i love papa
Love uuuu
Squishy Mochi!!!!!
Its so funny that ro has to stand on a stool
I know this is weird but my friend and I were talking about stuff (idek)  and suddenly Lele got involved and we were just chatting about her when my friend brings up this dude named GGuAnPa, and so I thought,  'Hey, didn't I watch videos about him like last year?'  and she was like, 'I really, really like GGuAnpA.'  And I'm like... "Oh yea I like Juanpa" *Correct pronunciation* And she looked at me like, "Bish you dumb?"  and she said, "No [My name] It's GGGGuanpa!"  Me "I'm pretty sure its Juanpa."  And she was just like "Oh.. well whatever"  and continued chatting lol. Lmao and she calls herself a fan.  Btw that friend is one of my close friends but she's kinda a noob on the internet lol. Honestly, though I was kinda triggered rip.
Jimin mochi!!!!
I love mochi it’s delicious
I never knew they where making jimin
I liked him and lelepons they dont look like a couple but lelepons and him look good p.s they are both spanish
"That looks like king Kong's booger" 😂😂😂 really juanpa 😂😂😂😂😂

3:59 juanpa imitating her sounds was so cute 😂

Who didn’t know the meaning of despacacito even after the song but Juanpa taught u
I love ro’s outfit I need I know where it’s from omg! If anyone knows lmk
Regular mochi are Rice cakes with red bean paste! Ice cream mochi is just a variant :D
I feel like Juanpa was flirting
*ROSANNA* I was so shocked that you were In ESCAPE the night SEASON 3.You survived the some episodes..I cried whenever *COLLEEN* went in the chamber...I cried when everyone of you died..I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 4 *JOEY* SAVING ALL THE SOULS TGAT HAVE DIED!!
the reason why I clicked this video 10% Juanpa is in the video 90% MOCHI'S (they are making Jimin's...…)
Lele pons making a flower shaped ice cream with Ro
It looks like slime
Holy Mochi
Most of the comments are about Jimin . I wonder if Jimin actually comes to watch a simple video of making green tea mochi and finds himself all over the comments section
I’m not trying to be mean but when you came back from the freezer I saw you had a step stool
We got some fortnite emotes up in here 5:55
You are so funny
where is your GF LELE Pons
I saw the mic in on her back
I love ro anyone else notice she was on a stool 😂 💕
Juanpa and Ro are so cute together, but I feel like if they were in a relationship their personalities and lives would collide.
This reminded me of Jimin from BTS... 😂
Huanpaaaaa!
Lol I'm weak he said "oof" at 3:25 😂
Mochi isnt just icecream wrapped in rice cake....
I love juanpa #juanpa❤
I’ve made a couple batches following your recipe but mine doesn’t turn into the sticky mixture your does. Mine is more like a ball of dough. No matter how much I heat it it doesn’t get smoother and sticky. Any tips?
Juanpa though 😍😍🔥
IM DEAD! I love that ro has a step stool!!!!+

I am just a HUGE fan of Mochi. Eat it everyday
I kid how she uses a stool
Mochi is a japanese sticky rice dessert. In America it's become synonymous with mochi ice cream, but there are so many more mochi desserts that exist. I hope you give them a try :)
I love you Ro💖❤️
It’s the gluten in the rice which makes it “sticky”.
I really like mango mochi
Oh look it's Jimin Oh look there goes armys
You guys can be a cute cauple
I subscribed

Juanpa kinda sounds like Fez from That 70s Show and I am *LIVING FOR IT*
dus hi no lele
late to the video but i love when ro steps back to go to her freezer and gets a little shorter x3 love you ro
I don't know why but I actually ship them 😂😍
I love how passionate you are about everything!!!
Órale jajajajaja neta amo mexico
I love your step stool!! lmaooooo
Hi
Hot, hilarious, Spanish, and talented... I'm in.
Juanpa's voice is so cute!!!
Also I've never had it but that Kochi looks gucci
Sorry this is terrible but mini lace had a dog named Kochi so think of it like this " what's that in there? " "It looks like little chunks of mochi." rip moch
Ecause WHAT. DO YOU WANT TO GO TO JAIL. ( sorry that vine has been stuck in my head)
And also look at the height difference
We need Twan, Lele, Anwar, And Hannah now
can we just talk about Rosanna's personality! aww! She is so nice, sweet, kind, cute, and amazing! her future children r so lucky to have a mom who bakes all the time lol😂 I love you so much Rosanna, your amazing!
“It’s looking like..like a King Kong booger” lol
This video made my day😂😎. I love Ro & Juanpa (Fav youtuber & viner)
My sister LOVES Mochi Jumpa
At 3:52 you notice that she has to step on something to be taller!! Love ya! ❤️
That time that she walked back from the freezer and just becomes 5 feet taller
Make connolys
Jaunpa is like a foot taller than Ro
Holy mochi .....
yall immature armys always gotta bring up bts whenever, wherever
QUESADILLAS SON DELISHOUSH *jfkwjdj*
COLLAB WITH HIM AGAIN PLEASE!!!🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆💝💝💝💝💝
we accept Rossana into the mexican familia
Jajaja its funny how you fail at Spanish by the way i'm mexican
The are so cute together 😍
You should do a mochi. Change loooooooove you
Please collab with the Dolan twinsss❗️
Proof in the Video that those who died in ETN 3 come back to life
is juanpa engaged becasue he has a ring in the engaged finger
Your so smallxxx
it was kinda awkward  i just felt that... but it was funny
I wish I had the money to buy all the ingredients for this xD
If you're confused, they're making ICE CREAM mochi, which is ice cream wrapped in mochi skin. Regular traditional Japanese mochi DOES NOT have ice cream in it. Usually mochi has red bean paste and a strawberry in it (daifuku), but then we can be real complicated and get into kirimochi, which is like a boiled rice cake that can be flavored it a lot of ways (mostly savory).
OH MY GOSH I kind ship them
"Making mochi for the first time" I was like: WHAT THE...THEY ARE ABOUT TO COOK JIMIN OMG THAT'S MOCHI CRUELTY 😭
He have a high voice lol
It’s stick to my hand I can’t move     Can we slap it 😂😂i Love Juanpa
Whatever happened to nerdy nummies
1:31 how will Lele Pons live XD
What's an apron that was beautiful
Am I the only one who noticed that Ro was on a stool
You should make some sanders sides cookies with Thomas sanders.
i tried doing this and the ice cream melts so quick and causing the mochi to not stick together :(
this is too cute <3
I think It’s called stick rice because when you cook the rice, the rice will be sticky and it is normal
ohh! juanpa you better hope lele doesnt watch this! xD
Can Ro be my mom plz? Thx.
Please do another video featuring him! This made me laugh so fast! I love the way you edited this video
“King Kong’s booger” 😂😂😂🤣🤣
Living mochi= Jimin. Like if you know BTS
I love you
Mochi
You people that do thumbs down are weird why in my opinion I don’t like Moche but I put thumbs up
YOU SHOULD COOK WITH TOM CRUISE OML PLS LIKE THIS SO SHE SEES
I swear you could make a million “that’s what she said” jokes in this video
the fact that she uses a stool is so cUTe-
Dear Ro Please collab with Lele next!!😁❤
Tortillas
you should colab with lele pons
u know when rosanna said its steaming, I had to check the subtitles because I thought she said, "its semen". im weird
you can tell *juanpa* was so confused  *ROSANNA* was like you can do this
I love Jaunpa’s accent soooooooooo much
So lele and juanpa are engaged? He's wearing a ring
Matcha mochi is very good!   I think it’s actually matcha which is kinda like green tea but more strong and is in a powder plus it’s even more green!
Pause at 4:53
I'm American and I'm 9 years old and I can speak Spanish I know only one bad word
Juanpa is so sweete and cute 😁
Can u do a video with Liza koshy
He Spiderman
Is there any episode of amigos
Well traditionally they put sweet bean paste in then buuuuuuut.... in my opinion the bean paste is to sweet 😝
i dont like mochi but that looked so good!
Is the sticky rice flour Mochiko?
Why cant i find this on Netflix😭
5:50 😔 disappointed​
I love red bean mochi
Ok, ima be honest, I only watched this video cause Juanpa was in it. 😄😁😄😁😄😁
I am learning Spanish in school
I love Juanpa!! <3 <3
I’m not sure but when I went to Thailand I think I had that.
(Halo kinda sucks)
Um sorry to pop your bubble but quesadilla comes from quetzal no queso y tortilla thats just an assumption
Juana is boyfriend of pautips
Mochi is not filled with ice cream! That is ICE CREAM mochi. It's filled with sweet red beans.
You two looks so cute together. Y'all would make a cute couple.
i bought a box of mochi for the first time today, and at the shop they were just sitting on a normal --out of fridge-- shelf so i just opened it a few minutes ago and ate one.......................and wondered why and IF it was supposed to be THAT soft.....and if i was supposed to put in the fridge or in the oven before eating it........ so after eating that one sad mochi i looked it up to come to an end with my internal doubts and here i am, ashamed
Likeeeeee
Is this for chim chim??
I'm so happy knowing that you use a stool to get to the right height in the kitchen too 😍
5:51 #SaltBae

I wish I had a friend that would actually like my baking, or at least tell me the truth. I baked my friend cupcakes, I put everything that she liked in it, and I asked her if she liked it, she said yes, but then she wrote a paragraph about how to make MY horrible cupcakes. And I even said I would make some for her birthday, but idk if I should... that just made me really sad for the rest of the day.😡☹️😥
It’s not educational for me I already know Spanish lol   Read more
Did you put plastic in the microwave?

I know juanpa
Ro, you've done almost everyone   What about Jacksepticeye??
3:25 hahahah hahahah 😂🤣😆🤣😂😆😅😆
Sticky rice is sticky because it has amylopectin. Which is why it is called glutenous rice (it does NOT have gluten, rice doesn’t contain gluten). The amylopectin reacts with hot water and creates a melting type effect (think of solder welding) and causes the rice to stick to each other. #ThankYouFoodScienceDegree
Mochi? JIMIN?! 😂💜

Aww Rosanna was standing on a foot stool😂💖
Can people stop talking about BTS? This is Juanpa and Rosanna, not whoever this 'Jimin' person is.  I'm gonna get hate from the fandom, but I really don't care, because I hate KPOP. Hate on me all you want.
Ayyyyy love when he said that
Pls do another video with Jaunpa
I love his ascent
I love how Ro got shorter when she went to show off the ice cream,  but Juanpa stayed the same 😂
Ro u look so cute today love ur dress from Hannah....😍
For people that talk spanish too. An apron is: un delantal
In spanish the word "Great" is: Genial!
😂😂😂😂😂
Ro has a step when ever she cooks!
Shiratamako
Isn’t the flour called Shitatamako
Zurita you have to cook for lele pons💜 its gonna be romantic
I’m confused.  She calls herself nerdy nummies but her channel name is actually Rosanna pansino
I now who Juanpa I watch his vines all the time
I’ve never tasted Halo Ice Cream 😂
I am Mexican
Please make something 5sos themed
Ok I just saw the tittle “MOCHI” and thought of Jimin only ARMYs know😹😹
7:16 😂😂😂😂
Ro always looks so short compared to her guests 😂

Wooahhh Ro its been awhile 😄 u have lost sooo much weight ? Glowing though as always
Omg i love this
I live in Japan so I eat Mochi a lot. If you were wondering I am American and I live in Japan
WOW YOU KNOW HIM💓
Please stop commenting about Jimin, everyone. I myself am a hardcore ARMY, but I am getting fed up with all the BTS comments on non-related videos. I understand that you may want to share your joy and love for BTS with the world, but Ro's comments section is not an appropriate place to do so. One of Jimin's nicknames IS mochi, but he was not mentioned in this video, therefore this is not an acceptable time or place to talk about BTS, or even other unrelated interests you may have.
Juanpa😍💛💙
Omg I love watching The Luis Miguel series!!!
😂😂😂 omg he is so charming!!!
JUANPA!!!!
Currently making this right now with the exact same Halo ice cream. Can’t wait!!

So many comments about jimin 😂

@Derek Gerard You better watch you woman XDDD
I just read the title and come bc its one of Jimin's nicknames....(mochi) And of course that I really like this channel I've been subscribed since its very beginning 😊😊😘
I really love Halo Top ice cream but their green tea mochi one is so nastay! It tasted like some kind of grandma's old perfume to me! LOL
OMG. Army fans don't understand mochi is a real food?
Low key never thought about these two being in a collab video together😂
Don’t you need to bang the mochi?
it looks like they could be a great 💑  couple
Num
empesamos!
😂At 7:05 ro is sooo small and he is sooo tall # I love u ro 😍
"What's an apron" omg he's too cute
The second you said this is now a learning channel I lost you...  LOL 😂
I tried to do this and failed 😂 so badly, any tips
3:51 omg is she on a stool 😂

Lmao I clicked on this video when I saw the word Mochi thinking there has to be at least one Army that left a comment about Jimin, instead 90% of the comment section is Jimin related😂❤👏🏻
poor Rosanna, she is soooooo much shorter than Juanpa😂😂
Can you make a Voltron cake please and I love your videos 😊
YOU MUST DO MORE COLLABS WITH JUANPA
4:22 to 4:27 😂😂😂 I’m dying of laughter
*holy mochi*
I love mochi!
I thought mochi is made by pounding cooked rice 🤔
tinder:D
the fact she stands on something makes me hit the like button subscribe button and natfication
03:03 starts cooking
Omg she looks so tiny standing next to him it's so CUTE
he looks stupid
rosanna plz give me ur no.
3:52 * takes little step to get taller *
He was in Lele Pons vines :))))))
I looooved this video!
Other people when they think about Mochi:- food Me when i think bout Mochi: OMG JIMIN YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN A COOKING VIDEO?! ROSANNA PANSINO MET YOU FOR FREE?!??!?!?!?!? OMG MUM NOW I WANT TO BE A YOUTUBER THAT COOKS SO I CAN MEET JIMIN!
I LOVE HIS VOICE RJFHDJFBSJFVDB❤️❤️❤️
I just realized she needs to use a stool to just stand by the island 😂
I wish I could cook like her 😥I've literally put the food on fire everytime I cook that's why I'm not allowed on the kitchen anymore
Make a FONITE 🎂 CAKE PLZZZZ
Can you make the curry buns from Black Butler please? That would be so awesome 😁
*_When Juanpa was speaking English I was like, FINALLY HE IS SPEAKING ENGLISH_*
mochi traditionally is made from rice. You beat rice over and over again using a wooden hammer and wooden bowl and is folded between hits using water on your hands.
I ship
OMG THIS WAS SO HELPFUL THX!!
I HATE Mochi, i throu it up once, haven't eaten it sence... i still watched the video tho.

Holy mochi 🍡
Next time just bring all of bts instead of just jimin
Is Ro standing on a stool while at the counter? Because when she and Juan pa step away she looks so tiny compared to him.
He said tinder 😂
Juanpa is so good at trolling people when learning Spanish. It’s great
Red velvet cake with somebody
"or else I won't be able to take out our pasta" Ro's face 10/10

It looks like slime😁😁😁😋😋👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌
Juanpa is so hot 😍😍😍
Omg, Juanpa 😍😍😍😍😍
Juanpa me hace recordar que yo soy latina pero aprendí inglés
3:33  She had to step down from the stool😂😂💀
When I first saw the word Mochi the first thing I think of is BTS Jimin

You guys keep pronouncing mochi wrong. The "ch" makes a hard "k" sound not the usual "ch" sound.
it's pronounced as 'moochi' but written as 'mochi'
9:16 was so anticlimactic 🤣
8:09
Can you make ice cream cake

Ro i just love your channel so much!  OMG J LOVE MOCHIS SOOO MUCH
When you immediately click on the video to first check the comments for anyone spamming Jimin's name all over xD  (edit) To be honest I may just keep this recipe written down and make these on Chimchim's birthday xD
He mixes the exact opposite of Markiplier
I saw mochi, I thought of Jiminie... I looked at the comments....... I guess everyone thought of him too😂😂
Now thats how you force a company to sponsor you😂😂  Edit: GO FOR HALOOOO!!
juampa was so funny
YES MOCHIIIIIII MY FAVORITE FLAVOUR IS STRAWBERRY (jk Jimin is my fav)

MOCHI REMINDS ME OF SOMEONE
Omg they made jimin my little mochi
Does anybody else wonder what they do during all the time it takes to cool and refrigerate the mochi?😂
Could you do a little throwback dessert? Like something they would eat in the 1700s or 1800s? Or when Alexander Hamilton was around :)

Literally 75% of the comments are about Jimin or BTS. Army is taking over, man. Forget about the Phandom, we have taken their crown.
Omg I love Juanpa! I love that he’s being introduced to the 🇺🇸
Rosanna pansino just baked Park Jimin
Juanpa is unprofessional
Rosanna I love your videos 😘
Hello, I was wondering where you would be able to find sticky rice flour/ glutinous rice flour. I’ve looked online at a lot of stores, and they all say it’s out of stock. If there is a store you think it might be at or a substitute please tell me. I understand if you can’t answer since your very busy. ❤️🍪❤️🍪❤️🍪

Oh dear! Looks fabulous but...mochi with ice cream aren't the most popular ^^ originally they are filled with red beans cream
New style of curls wow
Does any fellow bts army’s think of jimin when you saw mochi in the title?!?
FINALLY a video of him speaking English. I try to watch his yt video of him speaking Spanish  but I have no idea what he’s saying 😂

This is not the original way to make Mochi.  Mochi is basically RICE CAKE.  Just wanted to let you know the facts. :)   And mochi is Japanese word but basically is from South Korea.  But those mochi looks greatttt
Ro: Did I say it right? Juanpa: ... yeah. I think you're Mexican. 😂

Look, I don't have anything against army's, but could you fucking stop with the Jimin comments in literally every mochi video?? It's really annoying.. if you look at the comments and see there's already like ten of them saying something Jimin related, you don't need to add more, just respond to one of those threads and have an army chat over there, don't spam the whole comment section with the same comments please
Juanpa is my celebrity crush

Oh,so you made jimin. Cool.
Its jimin!(from BTS)
Rock and his hight differens is ufgufyhfujhfxfyjfgufyjdtu to is so small and not trying to be mean
I’m Mexican
The green tea mochi could be for...                                                                                                                    Jimin/little mochi ❤
Pls collab with bretman
They would be a cute couple 💞🥠
They lool so fucking cute together
The Netflix show is amazing!!!
Hey roe can I come over to cook with you plz
What’s a apron? 😂 Why do they look like they are brother and sister??!!?!? 😳
i'm going to eat mochi Aka Park Jimin that was dirty and i ship Ropa
Ur learning Spanish
If we were in Spanish call she would be me!  Me: "estobo serqa"._.
If she was like 10 years younger.... id ship it!!!! Ropa!!!
Mochi is most of the time filled with bean. Mochi ice cream is a good dessert.
I like how your just stating the facts and Juampa looks like he has no idea and just agrees with you 🤣
his voice
Either ro magically grew taller or she's using a stepping stool 😂
He is doing vids with all my fav youtubers rosanna and the dolans !!!!!!!
🍡🍦
I don’t know why but I love his Voice or accent ♥️😂♥️
🍡🍦
Kids can make MOCHI too. We made cookie dough flavor. Check out my video! Subscribe and please give s thumbs up it will help me!
I wanna see Rosanna cook with BTS!😍😱 #ARMY
I love that Ro has a stool! That would be me too thought.
Me: Making mochi for the first time...making Jimin for the first time?
This guy is hilarious 😂 ♥️
Mochi?🤔 Were is Mr Park Jimin? When you an army and like straight up thought of Jimin 😂
Juanpa is freaking BEAUTIFUL
These are also not inspired by dumplings. Dumplings come from China, and omochi, (not mochi) come from Japan. Also, usually omochi are not stuffed with ice cream, but are instead filled with red bean paste made from azuki beans. Also called anko. Don't worry I'm Japanese.🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
OML 4:36 SARCASTIC JUANPA IS BACK AMIGO'S
WHYYY ARE YOU EATING JIMIN 😭😭😭😭😭😂
Just because, they are pronounced omochi, not mochi. Don't worry I'm Asian and my mom makes these with me all the time
HOLD UP YOU CANT MAKE MY MOCHI JIMIN HE IS ALREADY MADE
Yet again, Army prove to be the most annoying fandom by bringing up BTS in videos that has nothing to do with them and just being disrespectful to Ro...
🍡🍡🍡🍡🍢🍢🍢🍢
YAAAY!!!!!!!! :DDD
Who else just noticed Juanpas Is so tall
wtf
Also gotta love Juanpa, can I ship this?
Why does this video reminds me of Jimin?!
I can't ever get over how Adorable Ro is, I really cant
This is so funny
Juanpa, los del DF te van a linchar por decir de dónde viene la "quesadilla" xD
plastic surgery is the devil
RO SPEAKING SPANISH IS THE BEST THING EVER
My favorite dessert is mochi too ❤️
Omg collab with Logan paul
MOCHI!
JUANPAAAAA 😂😂
Thinking of jimin hahaha gonna cook mochi
uuuuuuuuuuuuum this is mochi ice cream. not mochi. mochi is the rice dessert AROUND the ice cream. so his favorite dessert is mochi ice cream. not all mochi has ice cream in it -_-
OMG I LOVE MOCHI❤️❤️❤️❤️
Me: *sees this video* oh cool that looks really good! Also me: *sees this video* oh Jesus Christ every comment is gonna be about jimin        Message to meh fellow army’s: plz don’t spam army comments. Ok? The last thing we need is a bad reputation on YouTube comments. I️ mean it’s ok here there is a mix of normal comments and stuff but plz don’t spam jokes about jimin on jam videos. Ok thanks.
JIMIN!!!!

My favorite feozen  dessert is ice cream and popsicles
My sister made me try that and i almost THREW UP it was gross to me
I remember watching her when I was in 5th grade, now I’m a Junior ur in High School 😭 anybody remember Nerdy Nummies?
Juanpa looks like hunter rowland and sounds like him

My favorite mochi flavor is Jimin 😝😚
COLLAB WITH SAFIYA NY- UH- LAST NAME 😂😂😂
JUANPAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i hope i wasn't the only person who saw how much Rosanna was flirting
Juanpa is wrong about Quesadillas.   The word in its native language means "Tortilla doblada" = Folded tortilla  So a Quesadilla can be stuffed with anything  I'm telling you this because I'm MEXICAN, and I do know my culture
OMG I FREAKING LOVE MOCHI ESPECIALLY GREEN TEA 😍mmmmm
The sound their making cracks me up 😅😂😊😁
Like si hablas español

GREEN TEA IS LIKE ONE OF MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM FLAVORS! I sometimes even get that flavor when I get Boba.

I love your channel Rosanna
JUAMPA! WOOOOOO!
OH MY GOD! with real mochi, you have to POUND IT, and also, real mochi doesn't have ice cream inside of it, it has "Anko," which is a kind of Japanese sweetened red bean paste made from "Azuki" beans. mochi can have whatever filling you want, but it's ususally made with Anko.  P.S. Please don't give me hate, this comment is *entirely* true, and I know, because I'm Japanese/American. Like if you're a fellow cringing Japanese!  Please excuse me, I have to go face palm a couple dozen times.
who else things ro and juanpa should date??
Ro: We met on Youtube Juanpa(love you Juanpa) :On Tinder
“We met on YouTube, (juanpa tinder) LMAO😂😂😂

I love mochis now since you made this video I am going to start making mochis for the rest of the summer 😛😝😜🤪
Luis Miguel is not a Frank Sinatra🤦🏻‍♀️ just a big spoiled talented asshole drug adict and is everyone ignoring he was in jail for taxes? Just a big ass who is earning money from this netflix show so he can get you audience but naa I don't support that

WHAT IS A APRON?! OMG I LAUGH SO HARD!!
HOLY MOCHI!!
landi eh😂
Can you make a video with Molly plz.
Making jimin 👍:)
U just made jimin lol
It's glutinous rice flour! Alot of asians use it! I even use it to make alot sweets! And we traditionally use our hands to shape them and spread them out
lmao Rossana is so cute runnin around with her heels and using a stool
When rose went to show him the ice cream I thought she was getting a spoon 😂
9:48 mood 😂
I have a question "what's an apron" I died at laughing
When i read Mochi i thought of Jimin
I love how Ro just gets shorter when she goes and shows Juanpa her ice cream, it’s like she gets off a chair and just walks away like a sass master
Poor lele
When I Red The Title, I Remembered Jimin “Army’s Mochi”
I've always wanted to taste mochi, finally I can!
7:53 notice how Ro steps off of a step 😂😂♥️
*JIMINS*

“King Kong booger” *no comment* WHY THE HECK ARE THERE SO MUCH ARMYS LIKE I SAW 8 ARMY COMMENTS IN A ROW WTH
Roe PLEASE HAVE JACKSEPTICEYE WITH YOU
Ro should do a colab with the Dolan twins that would be hilarious
Where is lele ; (((
Oh my gosh just stop talking abt jimin. We. Get. It. He's a mochi ha ha ha. A few comments abt it are enough, don't need to bombard the comment section with tht overused comment. Literally every video tht has to do with mochi the jimin comments are always there and people are tired of it. Don't get me wrong, I love tht busan boy but it is tiring and annoying to read abt that again and again. Please, stop it D:
Making Jimin 101
It looked like slime
Do crepes
ok but if this wasn’t the cutest thing i’m not sure what is   “bloop” “bloUp”  “shoum” “.. CHoum”  he’s trying his best 😫👏🏼 and her noises were so CUTE
Idk if I like this or not?
Everyone making BTS comments, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, S T O P. I like bts, I really do, but that doesn’t give us the right to make every single youtube video related to it. You guys are completely taking the focus away from the actual video to promote your group, even though it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with kpop. Ro and her crew put so much effort into making this video, and you’re just going to make everything about Jimin? Seriously? Come on you guys. I’m disappointed. Ro deserves better. This is Ro’s channel, so just watch her video and stop giving all the focus to BTS.
This video made my day :))
11:45 wtf is a pancake? Mexicanos only know hot cakes 🤪
Do Something With Ld Shadowlady!!! PLEAAAaAsE
8:55 “what’s an apron” 💀
¡Lo siento! But my gay ass adores him because hes super awkward. Not like in "oh god im so uncomfortable" but more in "please dont let me mess this up. I just wanna have some mochi, por favor"
Did anyone else notice how Rosanna had to step up on a step at 3:50 it’s soooo cute she’s just a cute bundle of joy I love her sooo much 😂💕
Why was this a little awkward to watch? 😂
did juanpa call it pasta @ 7:14 ???? 😂💀

It'd be awesome if she collabed with the Dolan twins
I think mochi is supposed to be made of glutinous rice and black beans but they did it another version but I think what they did tastes good too
Not everything is about fucking bts. Gtfo

I love Luis Miguel la seria
AWWWWWWWWW Ro had to stand on a step stool how cuteee! She's such a mochi
empesemos
Cringiest mochi making video ever. Why ro why??
this is a comment section I have been a fan of Ro  wayy than longer than BTS , and this is a comment section, meaning we can comment. And I see people making irrelevant comments all the time but the moment it's something related to kpop or BTS everyone gets mad . And those of you that have been here for a while know Ro believes in everyone having there own opinion and not judging. And I'm pretty sure she wouldn't mind, so stop being rude just because you don't like something
He is so cute! "Oh it's a cupcake tray...." lolololololololol "Do you need a apron" "What's a apron..." he is so funny
Any Mochi Chim chim ARMY out there??
I love Juampa! He’s so amazing lol! ❤️✨😂

I had mochi a few months ago and mine had a red bean filling inside there was no ice cream I bought mine from a Japanese shop
Where is Derek Gerard's comment at lol
Can you bake with bratayley Annie and Haley
Why is this Jimin💜👑
Yay! Juanpa!
this whole video had NOTHING to do with BTS. I am army/ BTS fan myself but this commenting about Park Jimin is very rude to Ro. It’s HER video. You’re not even acknowledging her hard work.
Army where are youuuu?
Green thing looks like slime
Please Pay It Forward to Tammy Becker and Elise Becker. I miss some of my old friends from high school. I love soccer and I played midfield. I liked it because I was offense and defense. Please Pay It forward to the Becker Family!
I love this vid
Mochi is actually not traditionally made with ice cream but instead with a Japanese kind of bean inside of the mochi
Have the Dolan  twins cook with you please
Do a collab with lele
This is soooo adorable!💕
Cutee
juanpa = salt bae
I eat red bean mochis a lot!
when they went to the microwave i was like he didn’t look that much taller than her earlier them i realized she’s on a step stool😂 and later you can see her stepping on and off it😂😂
BRO WHY ARE JUANPA'S EYES SO FREAKIN BEAUTIFUL💗
I never tried mochi .___. I feel left out
I tried it and it wasn't bad but it wasn't nothing to write home about lol was very disappointed in salted Carmel.. birthday cake was the only other one I tried and it was better but not better than plain old ice cream lol
*I understand it’s only been one Collab  but I ship it so hard*
Where is the nerdy cookie I missed   it
RO IS STANDING ON A FREAKING STOOL YESSS
OMG JUANPA BIG FAN ❤️

Rosanas spanish is so cute
Today is  my  birthday 27 July
The fact how they say mochi. Has me cringing it’s ew but otherwise I liked it
Anytime​  sprinkling something, I half to do that it's to funny.
I used to eat Mochi before Mochi was cool. Because my grandma is Korean and grew up in WWII so she, ya know like Japan happened. And she would buy me Mochi all the time. Now if I say "Oh my gosh I love Mochi!" People think that I'm being really basic and trying to be cool. But I don't need to try. 😎😎😎...... 😂 but I'm low key really upset that people straight away assume that I like Mochi just because it's popular.
I'm Latina
Isn't he dating lele
Is she on a stepping stool 😍😍Adorbs
YAY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS COLLAB FOR EVER!!😝😝

Why are they making Jimin? I mean, I love him too, but he's like getting really busy with his schedule  and everyone trying to summon him...
They both have such similar personalities. It’s what made the video 10 times more enjoyable

Ooo I like him
“Órale,orale” 😂
http://instantworking.com/?dowork=52876
Kinda ship it😉😜
You have different types of rice, long grain and short/small grain. The long grains are dryer like basmati and white rice and the smaller grains are stickier like jasmin rice and sushi rice. The small grains are stickier because of the amount of starch they  contain! You also have broken grains which are leftovers from production and they can be used as dessert rice. Because they're broken they can absorb lots of moisture!
I literally just tried mochi yesterday
Can you make ice cream rolls they’re very trendy rn
But, this isn't mochi. It's rice with bean paste inside. I've seen this, keep in mind I'm talking about traditional mochi. Don't come 4 me.
COLLAB with Lele Pons!!!!
awe ro is so adorable i’m done
I want someone to look at me the way juanpa looks at mochi😭😂
Who else thought of chim chim while watching this
Your so short it's freaking adorable
"It's like 2 desserts in 1!" That's because it IS 2 desserts in 1. You made mochi ice cream, which is ice cream and mochi combined. Normally, mochi isn't frozen and is filled with red bean paste.
*Dood, most of these comments are about Jimin im DED XD*
Omg 😂😂 you can see ro get back on her stool 💕❤️❤️💖💕

I heard him say so many words I recognize from despacito 😂
OMG I love him and you❤️
You should have chef Gordan Ramsay on your channel.
This inspired me to make mochi but I made vegan ones with vegan ice cream. There were a few problems; the mess of the corn starch, the ice cream melting and pinching the sticky rice dough. But overall it tasted great, I also made a chilli chocolate sauce that complimented the mochi well
SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL PLEASE
juanpa is so cute and funny at the same time😍💕❤
can you make a cake that looks like your dog
People are only commenting about Jimin from bts or how much they ship them 😂
He’s like a little kid 😂
The dress 💕
You know who’s my Mochi.              Jiminie.

I love mochi too I'm Japanese so it's delicious I love I'm more of a fan of the real mochi with beans but the ice cream one is fine too
I thought I was the only one who ate green tea ice cream
*Someone tell them that Jimin is not edible😭😭*

I love Juanpa so much hes so cute

Please make dragon breath !!!!!! 💗
So many people are getting triggered about someone thinking juanpa and ro look cute together. 1)It doesnt matter if she has a boyfriend, our opinion on thinking her and juanpa are cute wont affect THEIR relationship one bit. Its not like its up to us who they date, it's their choice. 2) Hes not dating lele, hes dating someone else, theres a WHOLE VIDEO explaining that they're just friends, its in spanish but still. 3) Just leave people alone, if someone says "I think they're cute" dont rain on their parade with negativity, its just rude :/
juanpa screaming, "jesus! jesus!" is such a mood 😹😹😹💗
A frickin cute couple!! Hook up with each other...now😍😋
I love how Rosanna steps down from her step stool to show Junpa the ice cream😂
The height difference though...lol

OMG! Ro and Juanpa is making Jimin😂 (BTS ARMY can understand this comment)
ARMYs love mochi... Mochi loves ARMYs...
Armyyyy who wants to see something BTS?
The fact that she stands on something(a stool..?)to make her taller is honestly so cute😂
I lovee mochi !
Can you invite Lele Pons
do one video with lele too plzzz
Fudge. I love Juanpa 😂
0:30 Says in his head  "Whos the smarter one now😏"
Juanpa is sooooo fun!!!!!!!! 😂❤️❤️
She’s short
I feel like Ro isn’t tall enough to actually reach the top button on her microwave😂
" órale ! Órale ! " that's my mom throwing the chancla at me 😹
There’s different kinds of Mochi besides the icecream one but the best one is 100% the best

I remembre Juanpa from lele pons

Idc idc *IM SHIPPING THEM*😩😩😍

I broke my leg
Im excited to try this recipe. Just wondering if i made with vanilla ice cream, what should i substitute the matcha powder with ? Vanilla powder ? Milk powder ?
Awww! "What's an apron?"
UNEXPECTED COLLAB!!
Everything juanpa did I would melt LOL 💕😂🤤
AAHHHHHH!!!!!! HAPPY 10 MILLION SUBS!!! AHHH CONGRATULATIONS 😀 😁 YAY!! 😃
LOVE she has to stand on a stoole
your back ground is too light and it makes some of us get really annoyed watching :( please do something about the lighting
She has a step behind her counter 😂😋
YOU JUST MADE PARK JIMIN💕💕
Lol I eat quesadillas like everyday
Ro I am a big fan but your like 12 years old beside the guy that I can't spell he's name
Thay would be so cute together like if you think so to
Anybody else irked at their misuse of the word Mochi?   Mochi is only the rice dough that covers the ice cream. It is not the ice cream treat itself. Regardless, great video and great Chanel!
Jimin my lil mochi 😁😂
Ro: Let’s see the resuslts... don don don don!  Juanpa: It’s great! Subscribe! Me: WHAT THE HECK😂🤣
1:30 haha

After i watched this i went to go watch lele pons and i noticed...he is in lele's videos and i was like WAAAAAAAT HOW DID I NOT NOTICE
Wait I wanna say my opinion omg love him!!!😂😂💕💕

He sounds like Manny from Handy Manny. Lol 😂😂
Ro swoons over juanpa for 5 minuets
You know mochi is just the rice cake part just on it's own? Mochi icecream is and different thing..
He blew my mind with the quesadilla fact
She's so weird and I love it lmao
Who else loves juanpa as much as i do💕

Oh my god I can’t stop laughing at the part where she steps up on the stool comming back from the freezer!!! We love a short queen 💁‍♀️

“Our pasta” *ro looks at camera very confused* 😂😂😂
I don't like Ro's new lips. I am so sorry.
I love how she pats the potato starch onto the rolling pin because she knows if she rubbed it on she would get so many inappropriate comments😂
Watch out lele passino coming
omg! I literally just watched his collab with the twins yesterday and now this! I love him
this sucks, I'm unsubscribing.
How would I make the mochi but Vanilla flavored?
I like strawberry mochi
my fab flavor green tea
He is soooooooo FINEEEEE <3
Lol was I the only one thinking about jimin
Could you try making something Voltron related if you haven’t already!!!
2:30
Did anyone get a mochi add? (Or is it just me?)
They would be the cutest couple on the face of the motherf***ing planet😍😍
She is so tiny compared to him they kind of look cute together hmmm I wonder what their ship name would be? Ropa or juansanno? Hehehe
I love wampa
I cant believe Ro is 33 and 4’10, I love her!
To honest I only clicked of this video because it reminds me of Jimin from BTS. Did anyone else click on this video for the same reason??????🤔🤔🤔
DO A COLAB WITH THE DOLAN TWINS!!!!
Ohhhhh you love him wow
Best collaboration evvvveeerrr
How is she so skinny, If I could cook and bake as good as her I would be soooooo fat!!! 😂😂😂
Zuricatas repórtense 👐🏻👐🏻😍❤️
Ro's makeup is so nice this video
I forgot who that dude is, and then I immediately thought- Oh... Vine died.
You should of invited lele pons

LMAOO WHEN HE SAID PASTA
7:50  "Ay"😂😂💘

Ro we met on YouTube   Juanpa tinder   Me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂dieing of laughing
Omg this guy is hilarious, how come I’ve never seen him before I’m definitely subscribing to him #latinocomunity
Wait he's married 😱
Please do an ice cream themed treat with Liza Koshy????
@ 3:52 you can see that  Ro is on a stool Lol SPP (Short People Problems) (I love short people so I love myself and I dont mean to be mean if it sounds rude) (im super short too)
I LOVE Juanpa
When Rosanna stepped off the step stool😂😂 Also I love her shirt
He is soooooooooooooooooo... hot❤❤❤❤❤
Put ur hair up
U make me nervous
Make another with juanpaaa ❤️❤️😍😂
Omg! I never could've imagine two of my world colide, I have followed Juanpa since he started and I have followed nerdy nummies since 5 years ago.,  this video is just crazy!  I love you guys
I ship them ;-;
He's so cute!!
Ready mexicans???        JUAN HULIO JUAN HULIO (Idk if I spelled it right .-.)
Yay Juanpa
Ayyyyy!its Juampa
You should have Liza on the show like if you agree
You should be a special guest on Nailed it it’s a Netflix series that home bakers are brought together and build some masterpieces and Rosanna should be the special guest I think it’ll be funny 😂
Just made it and it totally worked! However I did change the green tea powder for taro powder. Also if someone is doing the recipe be careful with the amount of water, at least in my case what ro recommended was way to much and I had to add more flour to overcome the situation. Apart form that great recipe and the dough is delightful to work with! (As long as you have a vast supply of cornstarch)
It kinda looked like green slime 😂😂
Love it the best juanpa 😍😍😍😍😍 love this videos ❤️❤️
I tasted it before it was bomb!
And I though juanpa was short....
Can you cook with Lele Pons
Comments:  99% = BTS for whatever reason  1% about the actual video and future collab requests
My favorite frozen dessert is ice cream oreo cake its really good!
No no no Ro. I'm so sad now. That specific flavor tastes awful. I'm sure you made it great, but a different ice cream would have been better. Maybe vanilla and just add matcha powder? 😊
I love mochi
Im still waiting for her and mattpat to colab cuz thatd be iconic
low key ship them
I saw Juanpa on the thumbnail and I clicked instantly! TE AMO JUANPA!!! ❤❤❤
I love Ro, have for many years... But mochi isn't actually an ice cream filled dessert? Its just a sticky rice cake, usually filled with sweet red bean. The ice cream mochi is more recent and not what is usually meant when you just say "mochi". I'm a little sad that she didn't make it more clear.
I love Juanpa I am so glad you did a calab with him
Hahaha this is funny
Who first thought of Jimin when they read mochi
Omg yeeeeesss! A video with Juanpa!!! Ro, you look so cute and tiny next to him! Lol >^-^<
“What’s an apron?” 🤣
I love Juanpa. So glad you did a video with him.
U are not making mochi u are making Jimin
Ro looks so much skinner
Lmao her freezer 😂
Awww, I used to love him back when he did vines, he actually used to go to mall near my house a lot, I never saw him tho. Glad to see he's doing great 💕.
Juanpa is so cute and his voice ❤️😄
oh now I want mochi ice cream T-T Love you Ro <3 Edit: I just saw all the other ARMY's here!! Hey fam!!!!! Yas, our precious lil Mochi Chim Chim <3
Wait wtf Juanpa has a ring on his ring finger!!!
I’ve never laughed so much!!
Is it just me that that checked Netflix for the show
I love mochi
They are cute together ship them like if you also think 🤔
Army where you at???
Does Ro have like a stepping stool or something 😂
Green tea ice cream and everything that is green tea is my fav
Is it me or most of the Comment Section around Jimin from BTS? Just wondering since tbh he is my bias wrecker 😍😅👍
not gonna lie, i thought at first she was referrin to one punch
make some thing else with markipler
He is SOOO Attractive 😍😍😍
Hahahahahaha after I was watching the vid there was a add of the ice cream halo ahahhahahahah
Rosanna:”We met on YouTube-“ Juanpa:”Tinder....wait what?”   I died at this part 😂😂😂  Edit:dang thanks for all the likes 😎🤙🏼

To can you make cake pops plz I love you so much
I wish they were a couple💖💖
Ro: I love this guy! He's amazing! Me: Yeah man, all Latinos make everything funny cuz they is btw Juanpa is hilarious 😂😂😂   Also Juanpa is me in cooking class 😂😂😂😂
Lol did you see ro step on a like something to be taller
JUANPAAA 😍😍😍💕💕💕
I ship it. All I have to say 💖
All I’m seeing in the comments is “I ship them” and “Jimin army” just 🤦🏽‍♀️
MOCHI JIMIN!!!!
He's stupid. It's called quesadilla for a Nahuatl word that means folded tortilla. Stop pretending you are a pure latino
Y ADONDE ESTÁN LOS KE HABLAN ESPAÑOL???
Juanpa me pone nerviosa bUT I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE MOCHI
Do a collab with Derek Gerard
Juanpa defendiendo las quesadillas con queso :b a hueso
“Ok..pause right here” *blows cover and steps off of stool that gave her 3 more inches of height*
Just me or is Juanpa in a lot of videos lately
Where did you get your outfit?? It’s so cute!!
Me and ro are both super short and I like how she has a step ☺👍
😍😍
Can you make something BTS or BT21 related❤️
did anyone notices that she has background music
Ro I was wondering do you ever bake for fun and is not on a video.
Please bake with Liza! Like if you agree
its technically not real mochi. Real mochi is a rice cake but the original ones have red bean in it. What they are making is mochi ice cream which is one of my fav desserts
Is it just me or is he basically andy samberg?
I think Ro has a crush!
Ice cream mochi is actually a lot different than regular mochi. Regular mochi is pounded rice that is rolled into little balls. There’s also mochi with fillings in it like red bean paste.
“If a kid fall into this, it wouldn’t survive” 😂😂
JUANPA AAAHHHHH
The height difference is so cuter
Ro is on a step stool😂😂💗
you are so tiny you are like his daughter
Ro i love you can you come to kentucky please 😉
Juampa is hot
Can you bring lucas and Marcus on the show to bake if you do plz give me a like
I don’t know if anyone noticed this but Ro said “Green Chea Mochi” when the mochi was finished. Just thought it was a little funny ☺️
It’s so cute that ro is on a little stool and in high heels!!!
Hey please do another video with mark when you get your dimond play button
You should do Mexican food next!!
He says “what’s a apron?” Ahah I died there
I’m pretty sure what makes sticky rice sticky is fish head oil
"What's an apron?"😂😂😂😂 I'm dieing😂😂😂😂😂
Ya vi Luis Miguel Juanpa
CHIM CHIM there you areeeeee
Starts at 3:00
Juanpa ! 💜
Bts cakeeeee
your dress is so pretty!!!!!!
“if it touches its child it attaches to it” oml😂
“What’s an apron?” He is the cutest
Hmm maybe the fruit Tray thing one one of the cakes from the dinner scene in the new beauty and the beast or a rose cake?
OMG!!!!! JUANPA I LOVE HIM ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yum mochi
He is so cute ❤️😭 😭😂😂😂 ik him I follow him 😛😛
the sticky rice flour is called mochiko, (もちこ)。its basically rice flour, but they use a different type of rice that contains more gluten which makes the flour stickier!
Ahhhhh!!!! My crush and my favorite youtuber. Ahhhh!!!!  Favorite video
I actually ship it ❤️❤️ Te quiero mucho Juanpa !!!!!
Hey ro can you do something splatoon 2 related? That would be awesome
I kinda ship them tho
"What's an apron?"

Im ROs biggest fan im 11
I kept thinking of Jimin throughout the whole video
YAY JUANPA I MISSED HIM YAYAYAYA
Oooo they like each other
Arroz con leche
OMAGGG ITS JIMIN
To be so honest this has to be my favorite one of her videos with someone, they just made this video so cute and plus I absolutely love mochi. I am so going to try this
Ship it!!!!!
I'm re-watching the new Beauty and the beast and I'll comment if I can find any food and I couldn't find the original on Netflix
I love MOCHI!!!!!!!!!!!
all the comments abt jimin and bts are low key annoying; this vid has nothing to do with them. im proud of how many people are genuinely getting in to bts but speaking as an army myself, we give our fandom a bad name by turning everything into having some kind of relation to bts when there isn’t one :/
Juanpa was so eager to eat the mochi😂
yay i LOVE juanpa ❤️❤️
I knew I would see Armys here , ‘I was really digging mochi’ that sounds wrong
Omg this was soooooo funny mostly bc i speak spanish and i can understand what he says im crom here but my parents from mexico  Edit:😂😂😂 cant stop laughing
Roe is like the grandma you wish you had... lol.
Tinderrrr🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂
JUANPAAA
❤❤❤
chim chim is the mochi, im sorry I had to.
Please Rosanna make a video with lele pons please😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤
He is so cute
How does she even press the buttons on the microwave? Love her
I ship soooooo hard😂😂♥️♥️♥️😩😩😩
I just realized she is so short she has to use a stool! Love you Ro!
I watched Luis Miguel
I loved this video, I love Juanpa, I love you, like this is the perfect video #quevivanloslatinos
Okay, Ro, I love ya, but THIS ISNT MOCHI GURL. MOCHI IS JUST THE RICE PART.  MOCHI ICE-CREAM is what you made... just clearing things up here bc tbh it’s really annoying when I see someone say “Ohhhh I love mochi” but they refer to mochi ice cream... 🤦🏻‍♂️ *sigh.   It’s okay, I still love you Ro. ❤️
My favorite frozen dessert is a popsicle
How do I put like more than one time ??? *Sending a lot of love to them*
YOU SHOULD HAVE DEREK GERARD ON YOUR CHANEL
i love juanpa, he's so funny in this video haha
Hey Ro!! One day can you do a Keto Recipe?
Omg they r soooo cute together. They need to go oooooout! I love u both 😍
i love how i still watched your videos since you are cooking on the tiny kitchen😂❤
“Do you need an apron?” “What’s an apron?” *Awkward Silence” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What’s an apron😂😂
I love jhanpa
Juanpa was so fascinated
"What's an apron"          I'm dying 😂😂😂
Try kohakutou next!
i love Juanpa!! he is my favorite Mexican D&G Model
Estubo cerca not EstuBo Serca but it was good
Ship them...but what about lele?
oh god this whole comments section is fLOOODDED with army
I need to know where did u get ur dress it is sooooo cute I’m obsessed
when he asked, "what's an apron?" i totally freaked out with laughter
Drinking Game!  While watching this video, everytime you smile, take a shot.                    Wait, actually don't try this... High risk of alcohol poisoning.
I recently watched one of your older videos and noticed how you have gotten in such better shape! Not that you weren't in good shape before, but your healthy lifestyle has helped you a lot! Great job, Ro! ❤
WHY THE HECK ARE YOU SO PRETTY!! Juanpa is cute ✨
It’s funny how she needs to stand up on something at 7:58
they look so cute 💚
Ro i love you!!!!!!!!!! I've known you since the Zelda cake! I also love vine so go juanpa!
they are making jimin!
Loved this collab
I want to make mochi badly
Juanpa sooo cute he should do like a cooking show with specifically Mexican Food I would love that
I kinda looked like rosanna I didn't like it
LELE WHERE ARE YOU
I love Mochi I just had some today
Ship!!!!😂❣️
Is it just me or are they both annoying
This was so adorable you should work with him more <3
YEEESSS i looove juanpa awsome vid
SHE HAS A STEP STOOL !!! 😭😭 that’s adorable
You can see And hear the difference of culture; Ro is so chill and Juanpa is yelling and moving around
Juanpa Zurita ❤❤🇲🇽🇲🇽
You should make the cake from Fortnite for there one year birthday
CAN U PLEASE DO ANOTHER VID WITH MARK
R.I.P Lele
green tea mochi is the absolute best. last time i had it was 2 years ago rip
All of the bts comments are killing me
JUANPAAAA!!!!!!❤❤🇲🇽
Honestly this is a good vid but the shippers are so annoying. Like I never got shippers but sometimes they are annoying. Like if you ship you do you but for them it doesn’t make sense
This reminds me of jimin from bts love bts
Juanpaaaaaa😍😍😍😍😍😍
OK I know this is wierd but they are couple goals
Who else just watches these types of videos and just never makes the good?
El bilingüe del Juanpa 😂❤️❤️❤️
So cute! I love strawberry and red bean paste mochi. I think the next video you should do is something voltron themed with one of the cast members! (Like Jeremy Shada or Josh Keaton)
All I see when someone eats a mochi is park jimin from BTS STAN them you will fall in love at first site!
I never knew you could make a Park Jimin in the comfort of your home....
*I reaaally need to try a mochi*
Everyone is collabing with juanpa       _my life is complete_
90% of the Video The Living Mochi of BTS (Jimin, my Bias ❤❤❤❤) 10% about the video
Or Rosanna with Matt
It’s edible slime!
He used his new slang from his collaboration with the Dollan twins "tea" 1:27
Is it me or I sooo ship Ro and Juanpa? lol 😂 ❤️
I think they would be a cute couple

I would suggest most people do some research on Halo Top ice cream it's really not as healthy as it seems, I use to eat Halo Top and yes it's good but then I found out what was in it and I quickly stopped eating it.

Hi Ro! I'm not sure if you know who bts is but they created some cute characters called bt21 and it'll be so nice if you could do a video incorporating them😊
YAY
UGHHHH he’s such a papi😩
I ship them❤
Mochi is japanese dessert and it is not filled with ice cream. The filling is usually redbean paste but ever I have seen an ice cream filled one. Of course making the dough at home is kind of hard since it is Japanese traditional and extremely professional work. So the way you made it is okay. The color looks so yummy.
OMG ITS JUANPA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH (Are you having Lele next?)
Omg is juanpa
Is Ro standing on a stool😂😂. I’m short too no hate. Love you
Make some ice cream sandwiches with Liza! Edit: With non leclactose milk

I thought she was gonna say guava juice
Some people down in the _lovely_ comments section insist on shipping these two (despite the age gap,) but I personally don’t see it. I really see the two as a brother/sister or student/mentor pair from the friendship they’re creating and learning off of each other.
Me: ro is so tall now 10 seconds later Me: whait what she is standing in the stool 💥💥💥💥
Starting at 13:00 Juanpa is just like "I WANNA EATT, I cant hold it. OH MAH GAWD. I WANT TO EAT THEM!!" I was laughing my head off! Lmao
Omg I noticed that Ro used a stepping stool to make her self escalated!!! 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
Comments section is half jimin comments and half "i ship them" comments 😂
Juanpa: "Whats a apron?"  Ro: "Eh..we don't need a apron no more..."  Me: "LMAOOO! 😂😂😂 *died of too much laughter*"
I know a mochi called jimin😍😂
Why is Ro standing on something while is making a video ?

Who is Jimin or what is Jimin?? I don't get why everyone is saying it's Jimin..
W.A.I.T MR HUSKY IS RO’S BOYFRIEND?!?
Ro pls make a Boyfriend Tag plssss!!!
I just realized that Ro stands on something to seem taller/to reach the counter.
Heyo Ro can u make a book cake or a Disney villain cake???
Junpa ❤️❤️❤️
Ice cream wrapped in mochi is called "Yukimi Daifuku (雪見だいふく)" and sticky rice flour is made from glutinous rice which has very high amylopectin content so it's more sticky compared to other rice
Oooooh Ro has a Tinder scandal with Juanpa!😮
BTS Jimin is the cutest little mochi ever
My big boy teaching my daughter wrong ha
I think you should change your video title because what you've actually made is green tea ice cream mochi! Normally mochi doesn't actually have an ice cream centre. It's more like a paste, for example red bean. Your mochi looks amazing though!
plz make brownies with little brown boy (liza)
PLEASE do something to do with Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them!?
I love her outfit so much
OMG HE IS BEAUTIFUL
Oh you talk about coco
If I would fall into the rice batter I would eat my way out
Why do i like the thought of juanpa and ro being brother and sister

Idk why.... but I ship this 😍
JUANPA!😵
OK just so everyone knows mochi is not ice cream it's a rice cake filled with red bean and other things and if it's filled with ice cream then it's called mochi ice cream
Fact of this video:Video 600 of Ro Channel.

When I saw mochi I clicked because  it reminded me of bts jimin living mochi.
Can you do more videos with mark
Hey! So Ro, if you could answer, or anyone else that's great! Anyway, I was wondering for the dough, could you substitute the matcha powder with cocoa powder, or even leave it plain? If so, how do you think it would taste? I have a graduation party coning soon, and I really wanna do some home baking! This looks really good, I just can't have matcha; doctors orders. Anywho; love you and thanks so much❤❤❤
How about an Electric mochi? Ya know... E-mochi😂😂

I waited maybe more than 3 months for this!!!!
I was shook when Ro came off her step stool. I didnt even realize she has a step stool there!! #shortpeopleproblems
I already watched juanpa and ro separately so this is really weird but i like it
At 3:52 did Ro stand on a stool????

Hey Rosanna! I have a suggestion that you could possibly do with one or two of your friends. It’s a challenge where you would have to decorate mini cakes on a certain topic and a time limit! Again just a suggestion
Please do something to do with the abc tv show Once upon A Time and something to do woth Loki. I love your bales and snack ideas. You inspire me to bake.

I love mochi and mochi ice cream!  Can you make something How to Train Your Dragon themed, I love that series.  BTW, my favorite frozen dessert is ice cream! ❤️
JUANPA
mochi with ice cream in it is called mochi ice cream. Mochi otherwise is just a soft chewyish and kinda sticky treat.
Omg i get two videos of jaunpa with two of some of my favorite youtubers in one day?!!?? Ro and the Dolan twins! This day couldn’t get any better
Me and ro r the same I always waddle to get stuff near me 😂

What Netflix show is he in?
Yaaaaaassss😍 Juanpa😍
R U sure Luis Miguel is on Netflix, cuz I can’t find it??
I don't know what a juanpa is but I don't like it  Also video starts at 4:10  For "YouTube's biggest cooking channel " cooking doesn't seem to be the main priority
Mochi is the rice dough part. It does not have to have ice cream in it. That is a sub group of mochi treats. Mochi is more likely to have red bean paste, another paste or be just the mochi by itself than have ice cream in it.
JIMIN ?
RO i WISH i was as BEUTIFULL ase YOU😯😯😯😯      Btw love yo vids and juapas iv ben wating for this to hapen
lol WTF Juanpa is EVERYWHERE! xD
Juanpa is my favorite YouTuber oh and the girl
I love Juanpa #Zuripons
I ship them .” Ronapa” is their ship name !!!!
if anyone knows where ro’s dress  is from please let me know
Normal Mochi usually doesn’t have ice cream it has red bean or nothing inside. mochi with ice cream is not common unless you buy it that way its more of an American thing it’s called mochi ice cream.
He reminds me of Fez off The 70s show
So I nailed it! Ha yeah you did ;)! I SHIP IT!
My sister's cat is named Mochi.
Encantada
am i the only one who thinks they would be cute together?! 😂♥️

Do a Nerdy Nummies with Aphmau!
i tried these from a asain store, i like strawberry the most
Wait… did I see you step on a step stool… Lol I love you Ro ❤️ ❤️
Can people stop with the " OMG SHE ATE JIMIN!!!" Its getting annoying. The video isn't even bts related, let alone music related. I know you would probably be annoyed if some kept talking about a band member on a video not about that band. Bts is eh, okay I guess. Overrated but alright. The fandom is okay too. Its a really sweet place I bet. But this side of the fandom is talking it too far. Making a reference every once in a while is fine, but trying to consume the whole comment section is unacceptable.  You don't have to listen to me, just hear me out.
Maybe one of my faves videos💙💙💙💙💙 love you both!!!!!!!! Los quieroooooo
I SHIP THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!! I SHIP THEM MORE THAN I SHIP MY DRAMIONE SHIP!!!! but they actually would be really cute together.....
More videos with Juanpa please!!!!!!
Can you plz do a collab with collins key😂👍
This guy (Juanpa) looks like the Mexican version of Linguini from Ratatouille omg so funny and cute
I love this guy!!
Juan is a beautiful man.
HE'S SO CUTE
I’m not sure if I like or hate his voice... it sounds like he had a sore throat and then gargled some salt water
Juannpa yay 🤣😂
Je suis desolee, mais je ne parles pas espaniol..
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW HIM
Hot cakes = pancakes 😂
He’s perfect.
rosana  derek jerard likes you and you should hit him up

It's so weird to see people call ice cream mochi, just regular mochi.   It makes me a little sad for OG mochi :c Like it's being forgotten.

3:25 “oof” bahahaha i’m cracking up 😂😂
halo top mochi tastes nothing like mochi/green tea. It's a disgrace. It tastes more like ginger than matcha.
This is Mochi ice cream, mochi is the rice doh stuff that is around the ice cream. I like it both ways.
I like how Ro's learning spanish!
4tbt t
SHIP
Did anybody else notice ro is standing on a stool
bro i ship like if u do
Is it just me or is YouTube glitching/being choppy a lot
He’s bae for real. 😏
I love ice cream and cupcakes you should also do a video with lele pons
Hola te amo
Why does he keep quoting Despacito? Love Juanpa ❤❤❤
me encanto!!
Te amo Juanpa! He’s so HOT 🔥🔥🔥 and funny 😆. Ro is so cute while trying to speak Spainish 🇪🇸, my FAVORITE MOCHI is MATCHA 🍵
STOP EATING PARK JIMIN. AKA MY BIAS.
Wait theres ice-cream mochi now?!
I thought jimin would pop out..
Juanpa is so funny when he said you guys met on tender and you said YouTube LOL 😂 and he is funny in general like 👍 if you agree 😂😂😂😂👍👍👌
I lowkey ship them💛
😮😮😮😮😮😮YAY
He reminds me of Martinez twins
Omg yay you did a colab with Juanpa!!!

He's adorable lol please bring him back
JUANPA,TE AMO PAPI😍😘❤❤u gotta have him on ur channel again Rosanna!😁
Dang Ro you have every halo ice cream you could ever think of you should open a halo ice cream shop and by the way Ro I love your videos and you should do more videos with Juanpa
I heard Mochi and I automatically thought of Jimin army’s wasssssuuuuuup
I've found that the mochi is easier to handle in larger batches. scaling this recipe up by a factor of 10 means it cools faster, and is easier to work, without tearing apart.
Sorry im really late I had to get up early and I had a migraine I threw up so u we to bed I just woke up great vid and subbed
I LOVE BOTH OF THEM ( he makes her look so small 😂😂😂😂😂)
Lele pons next
can you do a nerdy nummies collab with liza koshy?

YAAAAY

Not only am I proud spanish-speaker but I'm also proud Mexican wow Ro you have entertained us all with your Spanish speaking
I absolutely love the fact that Ro is on a step stool. That's absolutely awesome
I'm on holiday in Singapore and spotted mochi in the supermarket yesterday and was like what on earth is mochi? This video is so cool😂😆
I'm a proud spanish speaker and im so proud of Ro to speak spanish
Despacito
Ro do you think i can use an ice cube tray instead of a mini muffin tin?💗

WahhhhhhhhvJuanpa!!!
que wea esta haciendo el hermano de luis miguel aca xd
This is the second video collab ive seen with juanpa today
You're making Mochi with Ice cream. Mochi is just pounded rice and then shaped into usually round balls.
This is one of the funniest videos I have ever seen.  😂
I love this colab, they're being silly 😋
Is anyone else thinking that you could make edible slime with this stufff
Is he married?! I wouldn’t be surprised bc he would be a PERFECT HUSBAND!! 😍😂
What is the so called
Would powdered sugar work in place of the potato starch?
I ship them
I wonder if she has boyfriend? Is she still single ? Someone let me know. Hie old is she ? 30?.35?
I might know why it's called sticky rice flour I'm not sure but sticky rice is rice that is steamed for a long time so when you add water to it and heat it up its like the same as steaming rice so then yeah I'm just you're average Asian
Ro  your awsome and love your videos because there fun and cool
lol this is funny
Martinez twins next!!!
Jamás en la vida imaginé este collab y estoy más que feliz!!! Los amo a ambos ❤️
I learned how to make Jimin today lol
Juaanpaaaaa
I love mochi I'm Japanese so I used to eat Michigan all the time when I was little
Tinder😂
Rosanna pls pls make a some sesame balls....sesame balls are I think asian goodies             PS: My family and I LOVE them but we can never make them
Spanish Pride🇱🇷🇱🇷
Holy Monchi 😂😂
if i see one more comment about jimin i’m gonna kill someone
I like these popular treats, but I miss the truly nerdy and geeky recipes 😕
Awesome video.
GOD I LOVEEEEE MOCHI!!!! It’s my favorite 😍
This dude sounds like he got a permanent hoarse throat
When I think of Mochi I think of Jimin. His cute little cheeks 😊
Me: wondering why an Hispanic is ft in a video to make mochi
They so like each other
They are so cute lmaoo
Shipped 💕💕💘💘💗💗💓💓💞💞💖💖❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Ro: “Do you need an apron?” Juanpa: “What’s an apron?” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
can't you collab with lele Pons 😀😀😀
automatically thought of Jimin
A dream come true my two favorite people colabing😍😍
I'm not going to lie, I was really mad at Ro for Colleen's death in Escape the night but no one can ever hate Ro so lol 😂😂😂
Juanpa 😃😃😃
That halo top tastes like Palmolive don't @ me
Ayyy hanpha
I love mochi, I love the mango flavor
Okay.... does anyone else get a little bit annoyed whenever people refer to ice cream mochi as JUST mochi? Regular mochi usually has a red bean filling or different variations like taro etc. ALSO YOURE USING HALO TOP GREEN TEA MOCHI THAT ONE IS NASTY!  This is still such a cute video.
you should make a Venezuela cake with lele pons
mochi😭😍
Oh tinder 🤔 ok                      IS HE YOUR BOY FRIEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ro stands on a stool?😂 And why is Zuampa's voice raspy?
insert 200+ clips of lele pons demanding juanpa if he’s cheating on her
When she gets off the stool to show him ice cream. She's so tiny!
His voice is so gruff... I’m dying
Come on Ro when will u post the q&a
R: How do you say close call? J: Estuvo... R: Estuo J: Cerca R: Celica R: Did I say it right? J: ... J: Yeah.. J: 😓

Please do a video with the Dolan twins that would be the best thing everrrr
Halo top matcha taste like fabric softener
i'll be honest, i'm kinda cringing from the way they made the mochi
Actually quesadilla means folded tortilla and doesn’t necessarily needs cheese
I am so happy to see Juanpa tho! :D
I love this crossover ❤❤❤😍

Collab with Lele Pons next! Also mochi!!! Jimin!! Army?
Steps off step stool😂😂😂
It's mochi fact time!  Mochi is a Japanese sticky rice paste. Mochi with ice cream inside isn't just called "mochi" it's called Mochi Daifuku. It is popular in Japan to wrap mochi around many things like ice cream, anko (sweet red bean paste), strawberries, ect. Anything that consists of mochi wrapped around something sweet is called mochi daifuku. Mochi is traditionally made by steaming mochi rice (a type of sweet rice) and then pounding it into a paste with a mallet in a large wooden cauldron. It requires 2 people, one to swing the heavy mallet, and the other to knead the mochi and put water on it between swings of the hammer. This takes intense focus and coordination with the other person so you don't crush someone's hand! Some people are so good at this and can go so fast it's insane, look up high speed mochi making videos. You won't be disappointed! What makes mochi sticky is the gluten in the rice.  Mochi is most commonly used in deserts such as mochi daifuku. It can be eaten on it's own, or with toppings on it such as sesame seeds or kinako (toasted soybean flour). But mochi is also loved in savory dishes. It can be put in soups, or grilled and dipped in soy sauce or wrapped in nori seaweed.  Mochi flour is called Mochiko. It's a simply easy way to make mochi, but it doesn't taste the same as fresh rice pounded mochi.  Fun Fact! In Japan, the term "mochi mochi" is used to describe something that has a pleasantly squishy texture. Many young girls want to have "mochi mochi" skin.  Hope you all enjoyed the mochi facts!
Juanpa is sooooooooooooooooooooo cute I think I’m in love😆😆😆😍😍
Honestly I like the ice creams that are made wi th water insteD of milk But I really love mochi

SAVAGE

Came from Dolan twins😂😆
Making my favorite dessert with some of my favorite people ! 😍❤️
Juanpaaaaaaa my king
Ro: this is now an educational channel   Me: WHY YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME! 😭
mochi is just the squishy rice pastry. The ice cream is extra.
JUANPAAAAA I WAITED SO MANY DAYS FOR THIS SAW THIS LAST MONTH ON JUANPA's IG STORY😍LelexJuanpa💖
You should do baking with Lele pons. 🐈😊
am I the only one wishing that Ro would do a baking ep w/BTS? edit: something like a snakeu cake or sprite cake
When us the video of u and mo coming out
We lowkey need bangtan to cook with Ro
*”If a kid falls into this, he wouldn’t survive”*
His Spanish accent 😍😍
you should try caramel mochi soooo delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I live in Mexico, where can I buy your baking line?
Never thought they would callab together
I also watch his brother rody
*Youtube notification* Rosanna Pansino uploaded a new video: MAKING MOCHI FOR THE FIRST TIME (to lazy to right the rest) Me: *smirks* I BETTER FIND ARMYS ON THAT VIDEO!
So funny
Ro you have one of the cutest waist I've ever seen...how can u  maintain your figure so well despite of making hella yummy food..
Omg!! I love mochi. I always thought it was harder. I'm definitely making these. Also love your dress Ro. I love you Ro. Also loved you in Escape the Night!!
ILY Juanpa!!!
Omg😂.this video
Video starts around here: 3:00
I love MOCHI
I love mochie
I speak Polish lol
I've never had Halo either...
Josanna is real !!!!!
“What’s an apron”😂😂😂
8:16 looks like slime lol
When Juanpa said queso and a  tortilla made a quesadilla, i felt so stupid because im mexican too XD
I think the sticky thing is called tapioca starch probably cause it is sticky
Hi hello friend's !!!
tiny food challenge please
Is ro on a stool😂😂😂
what are they talking about ! Mochi doesn't have icecream !? it's dried fruit paste or beans, dafuk
Mochiception
OMG THEY LOOK SO GOOD!!
You guys are alot of fun!! Love this idea!! great stuff!!!
You should make something pineapple themed with the Dolan twins
Love how ro uses a small step so she is taller and reaches the counter better😉❤️
I feel like this is a brand deal for halo top
Am i the only one who thinks he is very good looking or what
The way Juanpa hugged Ro😀💕I love it
I wish I could have the Halo Top ice cream, but I'm dairy sensitive and react badly to erythritol. 🤢 ...so I'm limited to the So Delicious almond or cashew milk ice cream. #givemesnickerdoodle.
Oh, wow, I never realized Juanpa was so much taller than Ro. Edit: I'm curious about what they did together while they waited for the mochi stuff in the fridge besides cleaning up and if Juanpa's personality stayed the same.
I was just thinking she never made mochi then I saw this
3:50, after all these years ,I never expected Ro to cook on steps.
id love to have jaunpa as my spanish teacher lol
I swear I was eating a green tea mocha when this vid came out and I screamed FREAK I WASTED 5 DOLALRS
Rosanna Pansino is the best YouTuber in the world! 🌎
Am I the only one who thought of jimin 😊
This is probably not intentional but his shirt has the iconic jughead crown on it sorry I’ve been in love with Archie comics since the 2nd grade
Juanpa is so tall
Now I have a very good reason to why I watch your vids so much, because it's educational, wow, I will be a Spanish pro if I keep up the rate of me watching your vids, :) lol
What's funny, I tried Mochi for the first time  when this was uploaded 😂
I just started a cooking camp and i love it. Ilysm ❤️❤️
He was on Lele pons vins
one of the funniest videos from you ive seen!
The tinder thing reminded me of the mark and cocaine
“Oof”or “tuf” 😂
Juanpa: what’s an apron  Me:😂😂😂😂
*the ice cream starts flipping in the mini cupcake tin* “JESUS JESUS!!” 😂
Lmao
Interesting, I've never seen mochi like this.
4:59  My new favourite saying                                               *HOLY MOCHI U STILL READING?*
can you do a collaboration with Logan Paul plz

If possible.. you should also collab with lele :DD!
Omg this is amazing, I love mochi soooooooo much, and it seems difficult to make. Also, I just had some mochi today and my friends were so confused by it, lol.
0:01 why did sounded that she said "Hispan--special guest" 😅
Good job ro

Yay!!! I’ve been hoping you’d make a Mochi video! I love that this is a quick way to make a Mochi. All the versions I’ve found online are real complicated and on the stove. This will be a nice easy way for me to make Mochi since I can’t stand for long periods. Thank you for this!!!! ❤️ I can’t wait to try this recipe out! I just need to get me some more matcha powder!
Can you collab with the ACE FAMILYYYY??!!!! puhhhleaaasssseeee
Mochi doesn't always have icecream in it.
i love juanpaaaa!!
This is so funny I speak both languages and love both of them . Love you ro

Mochi means “Sweet Cake” doesn’t it? I’m gonna start calling Ro “Mochi”
Salted Caramel would be really good!!!
OMLLLL YASSSS
Hims voice 😍

JUANPAAAAAA! I missed this boy so much
The best thing is that Ro has like a step stool for the counter
You can make instant mochi with mochi rice and water I'm Japanese my mom makes mochi.
My whole day was such a mess , hearing about so many people dying and thousands of others in need of life staples trying to help them  (living in Greece and there have been some serious fires here yesterday killing 76 people injuring more than 190 and more than 1000 houses have been destroyed. )   Those two really made my day . Thanks 💕 #prayforgreece

This is called mochi ice cream, mochi is just a rice cake
Do more videos with Juanpa. Please
Yesssss finally I’ve been waiting for this vid for forever yayyyyyy juanpa
Hi Rosanna!  Love the video.  Just a quick correction.  There is a difference between MOCHI and Mochi ICE-CREAM.  Kinda like his explanation of quesadilla being a combo of TORTILLA and QUESO.  The Mochi is what you wrap it in.  Hope that makes sense ❤️
Best collaboration of the year
Adorable! I loved how Ro stepped off her stool - I already thought she was tiny beside Juanpa. XD Love you guys!
I love this collab 😍❤️
I’ve never thought I’d watch Juanpa and Rosanna in the same video omg 💕

There so gorgeous 😭 This video made my day
Mochi has ice cream in it? Are there different kinds of mochi because I had mochi for the first time in Japan town in SF and there wasn't any ice cream in it, it was just a ball off chewy gummy goodness.
Did you know in Mexico City if you don't ask for your "quesadilla con queso" you won't get cheese on it... But not in other parts of Mexico, just Mexico City.
I love ice cream sandwiches! Can you make Kirby themed dessert please?
I know him he is in Logan Paul videos and in Lele ponsa videos too

anyone think Juanpa was tryna flirt with Ro? at the very beginning he was pretty touchy 😂😂 anyways he seems like such a great person to talk to and be with. a great energy
All i thought during this video was  *cHiM cHiM*
Rice is sticky because of how much water you put in it and how you cook it. For instance using a pressure cooker use less water because of how it "cooks" food.
7:50 it looks like Ro steps on and off a stool.... I RELATE SO MUCH.
I love this video its so funny
Ro got her lips done?? Wtttt
I litterally just bought mochi!
If anyone that doesn’t know, you can die from Mochi by choking from it.

I have mochi sometimes but I end up having the ice cream falling out :/
Juannnpaaaaaa amazingggggg
Juanpaaaaaaaaaa!

I am not Asian so correct me if I am wrong, but I think it’s sticky because they don’t add any oil into the rice.
This is messy but amazing ❤️😅
Love it!!
Make riverdale southside serpents cookies
Something from fortnite plz
Ro you should do one with lele pons and hi Juanpa
Is it just me or do u totally ship them😂
I love mochi too!
When Ro tried to say Cerca i thought she said Ceja😂❤️ (sorry if I spelled it wrong I only speak Spanish not write it😂)
I’m dead when ro steps off the step stool I was like damn she is short
Is it bad that i kind of ship them?
7:27 me @ myself in the mirror every morning tryna convince myself
I just laughed so loud when he said pasta and my aunt is sat in front of me and she was so confused
Love it!!! My two favorite youtubers!!! Lol Ro have to get on a bank!
I love mochi but failed making it. Maybe because I tried a hand at the ice cream one after not knowing how to make it and what was the proper way to make it. It’s so yummy~~~
YAAAAAASSSSS!!! I FREAKING LOVE MOCHI!
We are making this today.but cookie dough flavored
YESSSS JUANPA

Mochi is NOT ice cream in a flour shell. Yes it is a form but traditional mochi is warm and dry.  STOP WHITE WASHING ASIAN FOODS
When I first saw the title I thought of Park Jimin
MOCHI IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL
Adorable 😰
YAASSS JUANPA 🇲🇽❤ So proud

HALO HAS GREEN TEA ICE CREAM OH MY GOD WHERE HAVE I BEEN?? IVE BEEN MIXING MATCHA POWDER WITH VANILLA ICECREAM
I love Juampa  he is so awesome
Can you do a funny moment and bloopers with guest
He's adorable. I'd just never be able to understand anything on his channel xD
I LOVE JUANPAAAAAA
Hola
it should be mochi ice cream or mochi wrapped ice cream since mochi is just the squishy rice part. i don't want people ordering mochi/buying mochi and expecting ice cream in the center because it usually doesn't.
Ro ending the video but juampa said wait but my opinion atleast thats what i heard
The mochi  LOOKS SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD
Ship😂❤️
U guys always make my day
I knew he was going to do the salt thing lol
al fin un vídeo hablando algo de español
I hate halo cuz my mom loves it and it tastes really bad
you should have juanpa on more often!
Juanpa isssss hooooot
🍧🍨
Hi
I ship them
Love this episode
Love this!!! My friend and I have been wanting to make mochie!!!!
Hi
I love this video
Love you both 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩!!!!!!!
Omg was Rosanna standing on a stool😂😂😂
Do a macaron caramel flavor
My sister bought the green tea mochi ice cream, and she is obsessed with them she would just eat them and nothing else. And she wants to know how to make it so this is helpful, thx💖
She is super cute
There so cute together awwb😍😗😘😘❤💖💞🖤💜💛💚💙👌👌👌
You guys are sooooo precious😣💞

MOCHI YUSS 😍💕
I really want those!!!

Can you please make something Percy Jackson themed food
Looks so good
I love mochi ice cream, but my favorite mochi is stuffed with taro. Mmmmm. I want some now!
I'm hungry😣💞
And I got a mochi chimerical
Haha she has a stool
7:56 she stepped up on a step stool
Hangout with juanpa again
to clear up any misconceptions, traditional mochi does not have ice cream as a filling. mochi ice cream is a dessert but generally when referring to mochi it is not a frozen dessert but rather filled with things such as red/green bean paste or black sesame paste
YASS, *JUANPA ZURITAA*
Ro: we met on youtu- Juanpa: Tinder. Both:what? 😂😂
Yasssssss ro is shorter though
Can you do something with elephants?
It's great how Juanpa is in this video becuase im spanish myself and its also education😂😂😂
Please do another Calab with him and markiplier
Yasssss!
Thumbs up for more Latinos cooking with Ross!!!
I LOVE MOCHI SO MUCH IM GOING TO NAME MY CAT MOCHI

Plz subscribe to my YouTube channel I just started 🙏🏽

Do Lele pons!!!!!!
la cara Juanpa 😂😂😂
I ate mochi yesterday and it was delicious!!!!!!
JUANPA
Ro, I'm not trying to hate or anything but that's ice cream mochi, not regular mochi. Regular mochi has fresh fruit and/or pudding/paste. Ice cream mochi is filled with, well, ice cream.
Jaunpa
I love when Rosanna comes back from doing something and she steps up on a stool because I'm short too so some times I have to do that.
i have been waiting for this collab for ever thanks ro!!!!
Ro is so cute shes killing me..
OMG TWO OF MY FAV PPL MAKING A YOUTUBE VIDEO!!!!! IM DYIIIIIIIIIIIIING

This is really cool, very multi cultural episode! I LOVE IT! Also, I believe what makes the rice sticky is just that it has a higher starch content.

Unless you have two well coordinated Japanese men pounding mochi rice to make it then this isn’t mochi.

It's "sticky" rice flour because it's made from a type of rice grain which when cooked is glutinous hence the name sticky.

I love your food Rosana! Every time I watch one of your videos I get so hungry! My friend loves your videos so much so do I!!!!
Lol they meet on tinder

JUANPA!!!Glad you made a video with him👍💜
My two favorites❤😭😂
Juanpa and Rosanna...this is already my favourite video😍😍
Whenever I see the word mochi I think of Jimin only me? ... okay I’ll leave.
I wached this video while i was eating a quesadilla😁
Omg!!!!!can't believe it's happening!!!
MOCHI INCEPTION
I ligit screamed when I saw juanpa ... I love him, Rudy mancuso, lele pons, Hannah stocking, and Anwar jibawi all my favorite YouTubers!!!!!! 😝😝😰🤑😇😍😍😍😍😍😘😘
Y'all Ro sounded so annoyed at him by the end of this video I was dying. 😂
Ro: You wore all black today, do you need a apron? Juanpa: What's an apron? Ro:...we don't need xD best part
Just saying this is ICE CREAM MOCHI. The classical mochi is NOT filled with ice cream, it is typically filled with red bean paste. Not hating because it is a common mistake from Americans. I have had many many many mochi in my life but not much ice cream mochi.
Someone protect my Jiminie  from rossana ...
You should make more videos with him they are so funny and fun to watch
Hey Ro, I know you may not see this or may not want to do it but my wedding is coming up in two months and it’s Harry Potter themed (Ravenclaw to be exact). I was wondering if you could do something HP/Ravenclaw theme?
Mochi ice cream doesn’t remained you of someone his nickname is mochi ??
Make olaf  cake 🎂plz plz work on it
0:31 The more you know The more you know! this was an amazing collab ro! we love Juanpa!

I have been trying to make mochi for suuuuch a long time and who better to learn from than my favourite YouTubed
Yayaay
My favourite ex viner with my favourite cook(Juanpa still makes some vines)
8:53 - 9:00  “What’s an apron?” 😆
Ro is gonna be so confused by all the comments about Jimin and BTS. For all we know, she may look them up and fall into our fandom. I actually kinda want her to make like cookies that are the BTS logo. I am BTS trash. Please do something BTS Ro. We love you!❤️
Ro: Do you need an apron?  Junapa: Whats an apron    OMG! That bit for me was really funny.
Q. Where did u meat  Juanpa- tinder
Yay Juanpa

I love you Juanpa❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Literally the DAY after I fail at making Mochi YOU out of ALL PEOPLE makes it and now I know how to make it properly... thank u 😂
Has to be my ultimate favourite video from Your channel Ro x
Mochi is actually just a rice cake made from mochigome, a Japanese short grain rice. It was adapted to a dessert when people thought to wrap it around ice cream. I used to just have mochi as a topping. Mochi ice cream is fairly new (from the early 90s I believe) and only recently became popular in the US. Just wanted to tell you if there's ice cream, it's called mochi ice cream. Not just mochi (that's the rice cake by itself) 😁
Juanpaaaaaaaaa  Rosannaaaaaaaa Mochiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Green teaaaaaaa
ro you should have alex wassabi as your guest
I think that Ro trying to speak Spanish is the funniest thing
You should do the impossible dragons beard candy

Oh My Gosh isnt Ro an amazing beautiful kind funny person. Acctually theres no word powerful enough to describe her
usually, Ro, when i make cookies I'd melt the margarine first and then mix it and the eggs with the dry ingredients and then pick out small lumps of dough, roll it, place it on the sheet, and press it flat. no extra flour needed to keep it from sticking to my hands.
Can you collab now with Lele Pons
Yayy juanpa😃and rosanna😃both together😍
I love Juanpa's accent. I have an American one. I am Pakistani. Everyone thinks I am from America, it is honestly ANNOYING!
JUANPAAAAAAAAAAAA  WOOOOOOOP
YAS JUANPA
I've always really wanted to play with the mochi dough...it just looks so satisfying🍵🍦🍡
Please make something related to miraculous ladybug or teen titans go please please please!! I like one request 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Please someone for me

Love your videos! Just so you know, though, "mochi" and "mochi" ice cream are different. The little mochi ice cream balls are called Yukimi Daifuku. Or you can just call it mochi ice cream. :)
OMG I LOVE JUANPA
Can you make the  mustache and glasses from the skorys and also can you maybe do a collab with the skorys! PS your amazing
what is his netflix show called?????
LOL Look AT 6:54 Look how tiny Ro is!!!!!XD
I love how most thingz in ROs kitchen is marble the counter tops the walls even the rolling pin
Y yo hablo español
I watched at 16 minutes out
Love you Ro! You should try to make these macrons that are shaped as a corgi and it has a unicorn horn on it! A UNI-CORGI! AND WITH A CHOCOLATE FILLING!
I was hoping you were making real Mochi ( I am Japanese and every year in December we make it. We make it by steaming rice and put it in a granite bowl and use a clean wooden stick and poke the rice  and then pound the rice with a wooden mallet and it gets to the consistency of what Ro had ( the super sticky one) expect a little less sticky and bring it to a table with corn starch and form the Mochi into balls
My favorite frozen dessert is ice cream
You should collab with Sofie Dossi or any of the cast of Stranger Things because that would be amazing
i love your videos ro there so creative!
I love this video so much ❤️
Juanpa: Imma hand tis to you.  Ro:okay.  Juanpa: Otherwise I cant get our PASTA!! LOL!! (im sorry but for me its funny cause i speak spanish)
