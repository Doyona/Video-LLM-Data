You are indeed an amazing Person - love the arrangement thanks for sharing
Is that coral or is that salmon? I have both.
Isn’t that too many plants for a 24X24 container? I am new to gardening and trying to make sure I don’t overcrowd the planter that could inhibit growth in the long run. Appreciate some guidance
All your work is amazing and watch your videos all the time and your property is outstanding keep up the good work
Ok I live in Kansas and my gerainiums are kinda wiltering in the hot sun do I move them
Look so beautiful all those flowers combination 😍
Cute together
Hello Laura, love your videos. Your so helpful to us beginners. Can you tell me what Zone your garden is in. We’re in Texas where it gets extremely hot this time of year. Thanks again
gorgeous, yours are the nicest arrangements on line.
Full sun???
This time I will do it manually with the help of Woodglut designs.
what did you put in the bottom of the planter?  did you feel the entire planter with soil!!!   8k pounds and 10k dollars

I love your videos!
Beautiful !!!!!!! Best colour combination of flowers .......
Totally copying this look. I absolutely love it!! Thanks for the inspiration!
I always learn so much.
Those are so gorgeous 😍
Beautiful I love the  colors  you used. ❤
Wonderful ideas. Is liquid fish  fertiliser good as a weekly feed??
I finally completed my my pool side containers arrangements. Thank you for all you advise
Love the colors.
Off topic, but you look like the original kylie Jenner before all the Botox and surgery she done to her self .
Can geranium flower needs cold weather
Gorgeous 👍❤️
Hi laura 'm your avid viewer on your gardening vlog Every day im looking for you. Anyway i love planting also and i wonder what kind of fertilizer you always mix on to the soil before you put the plant . If you dont mind can i  know it so i can get one for my next plant.thanks and have a great day
Beautiful planters!! I really enjoy watching your videos.  I have been a gardener for many years  but my pots have never looked like yours do.  I do pretty much the same  as you when planting, but am thinking I don't fertilize enough throughout the growing season.  My question is  when you fertilize with a water soluble fertilizer how do you do it. and how often. I mean what do you use to do it.  most water solubles say like 2 tbsp per watering can.. well I have an acre very large yard like yours. filling a watering can is just not practical.. How do you do it.  and also I know you use all the Proven winners products but I can't get these where I live.  What should I be looking for in a fertilizer to produce flowers like you do.  thank you! Lucy
I'm enjoying the awesome advice. Thank you  😊
Can I use this arrangement for window boxes?
Another gorgeous work of art! I have a question Laura, don’t you have deer or rabbits where you leave? I copied few of your planters last year and they looked almost as beautiful as yours! But I was covering them every nights with nets to save them from our deers and other creatures who loves our plants!  Can you please make a video of how to prevent deers from our yards ? As always, thank you , thank you and thank you!❤️🌷🌸🍃
Thank you Laura - do you always totally fill the containers with new potting soil ?  Do you ever just add to existing if roots don’t go very deep ??
Tedria k ser en castellano tambien gracias
I made it too. Just used woodprix for that :)
no no those are pink not coral
I made a container that looks just like this  so pretty!
Book ! Fabric ! Flag pice./ Natural Food plant / Farmer Bence /
Omg!  That purple supertunia!  Stunning!  Thanks for posting!  Beautiful blend! 👍
🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
More geraniums please!
Absolutely beautiful! Excited to see later as the Ktut grows!
You know we are not all expert gardeners like you. Would you plz tell us how you mix your soil for these containers?
Beautiful. Excellent Job. I'm going to be dangerous.
This is absolutely beautiful. The double purple petunias are my favorite
What does well moist soil mean? Watered before planting?
Great colors but I also like so many other combos. I haven’t found supertunias in our northern Indiana area. Love watching your videos though...
I'm in love with your large containers, where can I purchase the Square state planters at? Been looking online & at stores but have had no luck.
Such beautiful flowers, and I agree that the pots complement the shutters.
OMG, what a beautiful arrangement of flowers! Thanks for sharing
Video would have been better if you didn’t talk so fast, need to slow down.
I don't get it. Those are small plants in  huge containers. Don't they need to be in smaller containers for proper watering????? I'd think they'd die bec the containers are to large.
I love your channel, but you talk too much......slow down.......
Hi! Where did you purchase your containers, and what are they called?
Found you today fab gardening tips so inspiring thx xx
Be careful with king tut grass tends to look like a weed in middle of your container. My two cents
I just love 💘 her videos on container garde ideas.
amazing...can i ask what is the name of the pink flower?
Always loved this girl .Her smile Is amazing and bright. So beautiful.
When you add slow release fertilizer do you still use liquid fertilizer later? Thanks for all your amazing videos!!
Which country
I tried to find some of these plants in a couple of nurseries, and they dont carry them. 😔
Que hermosura. Bello bello.
how many plants can I put in a 12 inch wide container? Zone 9a
I love this video I come back every time to watch it!

Very pretty, love your channel!
What's the name on the first plant mentioned?
Great
Can I keep a portulaca plant through winter
Even though this is a container from last year it is still one of my favorite containers I have seen on your channel 😊
Beautiful
I was wondering if you could actually harvest seeds from supertunias because I tried it and i couldnt find any. And i las thinking if you could show us a video when you grow supertunias from the start of their life and so se can know how to make more supertunias.
It's beautiful Laura! How can you afford so many flowers! I looked up supertunia and they are $35 for 4 x 4.5" pots....ridiculous
Beautiful this lady is on top of things, i feeling like i should no her any way beautiful home!
Love them , is the grass center piece good for full sun.. I want to put that in my front pots :)!
Just found your channel. Loving your videos. So inspiring. Could you do some planting ideas for the southwest. I live just outside of Phoenix. Talk about full sun and heat 😱!  For about 3 to 4 months out of the year it's like the surface of the sun. Thanks.
I have a question about sun patients. Do they have to b in full sun? I put some in container with other plants on my porch, in full light but not sun, and they don’t seem to b growing like I thought they would, maybe I should be more patient myself?
Can I use roses as the centerpiece? Thank you!
what kind of fertilizer you use.
Hi Laura, what type grass was it? That geranium color was spectacular!
I love your videos! Thanks for all the tips
I just discovered you and am loving alllllllll your videos!! Which water soluble vitamins do you use. You posted the slow release but not the water soluble. Thanks
Beautiful planter arrangements ! Love all the flowers you used in them !! :) I Love your Channel, its my Favorite, I'm always learning new things, and love watching Everything ! Thank You for another Great Video... 🌻🌻🌻
Thanks great info.  I was wondering which video has the update on this so I can see the grass?
Hello Laura! I know this an older video, but it’s important to note that these geraniums are actually pelargoniums! It would be interesting to dedicate a video on the difference between “hardy geraniums” and pelargoniums! They are both gorgeous plants but I believe pelargoniums deserve the proper name :-)
Love your channel! Please do more plants for sun.
Could you please speak a little more slowly? I want to write down the names of some of the flowers. Thank you. Your flower choices are beautiful.
😮
They are lovely!!
Grrr, i love this so much, but the deer here would eat it in 24 hours.  Beautiful plants!
👍👍👍
Hola soy gabriela y vivo en guatemala casi no entiendo lo que dices en tus videos tengo que preguntarle a mi esposo porque el si habla inglés pero aunque no entienda mucho me fascinan tus videos
I have a beautiful ( or it was) geranium hanging that my daughter got me for Mother's Day but I'm a bit sad it's not looking good, do you have a video on caring for a hanging plant?
Can you please mention in a video what slow release and what liquid fertilizer do you use?? Miracle grow killed my plants
I love these planters,so classy looking!!
Gosh I LOVE those coral geraniums!
What is the name of the center piece again?
Looks great!!
Love the planters! They look gorgeous! That double purple supertunia! Beautiful.  I was wondering what brand of water soluble fertilizer you use that you really like? Thanks for the great videos.
Love it. Happy growing.
Just a reminder to everyone; Don't forget to pluck the flowers as they die off too. This will encourage your flowers to continue producing blooms. Because it tricks the plant thinking it hasn't gotten any blooms produced to continue into seed... ~Green Blessings
When you are replanting containers do you take out all the old potting soil?
How do you keep those container plants watered when you're away on vacation?
Last year you planted Strawberries in a white laundry hamper and said you would show an updated version.  I never did see it or did I miss it?  I planted one and got 6 strawberries but I live in a colder climate, Newfoundland.  Just wondering how yours did.
Is this your front door entrance area?
So nice! Excited to see the prince tuts fill in!
Is the whole planter filled with dirt or just halfway?
Dear Laura,                        Wow! I just love that planter! I think that plants in pots look great and make an amazing statement in the garden! I just saw your, "Tree Peony" video! It looks like an awesome plant! If I had a garden like you have, I would be overwhelmed! I've watched your garden tour video's and I've seen how much you have to take care of! I greatly admire people who work out in the garden like that and end up with a beautiful space like yours!                        Thank-you and God bless, Jackson Miley.
Beautiful!!!
How can I plant and take care of plants that started as seeds?
beautiful!
Beautiful as always you guys!!! You honestly get me so excited to garden!!
pretty pots
Laura, please, please tell me what to do to get rid of mealy bugs.  They are killing my collection.  I've tried alcohol now what?  HELP....
Beautiful!
Any chance you could show us how you do your water soluble fertilizing and what products you like best?
love ur videos
That grass looks very beautiful when grown 😃 great video!
I give my flowers once a week Jack's let me know what you think about that
beautiful
Hey thanks to you laura i now have a job at my local nursery!!!
How many bags of potting soil did you use in one of those containers?
Perfect timing!! I was looking for full sun containers and these are gorgeous. Thank you soooo much xoxoxo
The containers you use are beautiful, but a lot of us use large single wall plastic containers for economic reasons.  Do you have any "tricks" on how to shade these pots so you don't cook the potted plant's roots?
I can't wait to see the update, these are so pretty.
so pretty! may have to get those plants now.
Those pelargoniums look fantastic, the ones in my local nursery are half that size
Great color choices!
Absolutely gorgeous!! 😍🌸Definitely one of my favorite containers you've done! 💜💛💖 Can't wait to see its progress. Only thing missing was a glimpse of Dexter! 😉🐈
do you grow mint? if you do hiw do you keep the tiny white flies or whatever they are off your plants. thanks. ..
Love!! Could you do an all season perennial container? Thanks for doing videos everyday, I look forward to them!!
can you show us how your vegetable garden is doing
Very beautiful
Perfect timing as I'm replacing my pansies today-I knew I wanted a pink and purple theme this year and this is just a classic look. Can't wait to go shopping in a little while and plant up my containers today!🌸
