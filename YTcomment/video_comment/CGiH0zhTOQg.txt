So glad I had this saved in my foods playlist! It's been years and it's time again :)  Google failed to have me find you, so I'm glad I had this video saved :D
Thanks! Very simple, short, and educational video.
I never had them before I wanna try them
Thank u
Thank you! This looks so easy to make:)
if you peel the ends they will be just as tender as the rest and you won't have to throw as much out.
Thank you!!!!!!!!
Just made it, added a little extra butter, salt and some garlic... Delicious! Thanks for the video. The wife even liked it which is amazing because she is picky!
Thank you for the fun video. You're a hoot and I am going to make some delicious asparagus, just like you made it.
I guess the top ones are steamed and the bottom ones are boiled.
Helped so much!!!

Thank u i'm cooking filet mignon tonight w/asparagus!
Mmmm that looks good! I'm cooking some today!
Thankk you!, Simple yet delicious!
stinky pee...
My info comes from one of the worlds best chefs.   Skip to 4:08  youtube.com/watch?v=ZF5VJmChoc0    If you want to keep the maximum amount of flavor in the asparagus, then boiling them is not the way to go due to the flavor molecules being too water soluble and you end up with asparagus flavored water.  Great if you are making asparagus soup stock or puree.  Otherwise, keep the flavor inside it and use another technique.  Louise, you are short bus special.
You NEVER put asparagus in water, (soup stock exception).  The flavor molecules leach into the water and it breaks down the cell walls to much.  Also, to separate the bottom you are suppose to snap each asparagus by holding the ends and bending them to meet each other, which it will end up snapping in two at the perfect spot where the fibrous bottom meets the tender top.
Thanks Ma'am.  And that's how I'm going to do them  thanks from San Antonio Tx
thank you :) I will cook those fellas today ;)
Thank you, I'm 54 years old and will be cooking my first batch of asparagus ever!

They are delicious, thanks for the video
Cute video. We always buy frozen asparagus...maybe I will try the fresh sometime.
she is the cutest!
Im guessing your fat..
I want you to be my mom.
You know what is bothering me? What is bothering me is that in the past people used to smoke cigarettes and use cocaine and nobody would say anything about it, while we KNEW what it did to people. NOW we do talk about it and cocaine is FORBIDDEN. What is bothering me is that fucking fast food and not exercising is worser than smoking your whole life but nobody is doing something about it. You know why? because fucking Mc Donalds has too much power! Because people like you eat there!
cool mate
Thank you :)
Thanks for showing such a simple way of preparing this.  ; )
Id let her cook for me anytime lol
Totally agree!  That's what I came here for.  lol.
Canned asparagus? #OnlyInAmerica
Ha ha ha! au contrairé my drole amié. Au contrairé
my recipe is far superior featuring succulent cranbérrie glaze and roast pécan souflé. This is recipe for peasants.
That looks great and an easy way to cook asparagus. Thanks.
Simple and perfect!! Thank you!!
asparagus is really good and I love it but my pee always stinks after eating it. LOL :D
Thanks for the simple, easy to follow instructions!  I love asparagus!
Asparagus is the best
hes silly isnt he. your body is your temple you should respect. You know they showed a society of vegans and cancer didn't exist within that society because they where so healthy. Yoga is a great way to stay in shape and cardio is good to if your overweight and after you shed all the fat off just do yoga everday to keep it up. Your body is your temple now fucking respect it
Thank you! I had no idea how to cook asparagus~
what did u do with the other part u chopped off  garbage?
YOU'RE LEARN TO FUCKING SPELL YOU DUMB SHIT
Awesome! Love asparagus, but never made it myself.  Thanks for the quick'n'easy method!  Gonna be chompin' on some in 10 minutes!  Happy Thanksgiving!
I really enjoyed your video. I can't wait to try it. Thank you for posting it!
...is it really that simple? Wow. I LOVE asparagus, but I've never been much of a cooker. I bought some tonight because I'm going to start learning how to cook for my spouse and myself. This is awesome! Thank you so much.
She's so sweet!
And by shrimp i meant asparagus! rofl
You are amazing and adorable...and you taught me how to cook shrimp. I love you! Keep up your videos they are very helpful!
cute
thank you
Well, that was f'n easy.....  tee hee hee.... :)
Thanks! simple and awesome!
Thank you for this vid! I'm trying to make a "fancy" dinner for my hubby tonight! Lol
thank you
I have tried this and it was great. Thank you so much for making is so easy.
Are you blind? her hands are wet, she washed her hands before recording. Don't be so naive.
Wow, this looks really easy . I'm excited to cook this tonight.
how come you don't wash before you cook
omg.. i love her. she's so adorable! i laughed in the beginning when she was laughing :P
Love all your videos - they are just great.  Wonderful Louisiana home cooking.  Thank you so much.   Beth
quick instructions and to-the-point! I hate videos where I just want to know what to do, and not listen to unnecessary blah-blah. thumbs up!
I think I'd rather take cooking advice from someone who knows how to eat! :) This looks tasty.
Thanks :) Just convinced my OH to try eating aspraragus (he's not a big veggie eater) and I'd totally forgotten how to cook it without a proper steamer! Ta :)
Great simply to follow video :) it helped me out THANX
Thx for the video! I'm a complete novice, you really helped me! your super cute by the way : D
thanks because i just started eating  asparagus and got some and didn't know how to cook it ... turned out awesome
thanks! wsn't sure about which part to cut
That lady looks like a sweetheart. I am sure she could care less what people on youtube think about her.
Nice crash diet. You obviously know so much about the human body.
cant believe there are really people on here talking about her weight. for crying out loud she looks like a nice lady just trying to show you how to cook some freaking asparagus. be nice. we're all God's people.
lol you're mean
Woman needs to go to the gym thou for real, she is fat. Go for a half an hour a day to the fucking gym, you wont fucking die. If you dont go and take care of your health this is the natural reaction, and you will probably die very young from some kind of hart attack. I know its not cool to say mean things like that, BUT DONT FOOL YOURSELF if you cant take half an hour a day to work out, you gotta changa your agenda.
holy fuck u need to exercise
Thank you; u've saved a life of an abroad student !
i love asparagus but im the only one that likes it in my family so i rarely have it:) they say it tastes like crap...
LOL What a twat.
I don't understand how hard it was to make this? I mean all you did was add a lil water, never said how much and then after it was done STEAMING, after 5 mins you brought over your pig troff and served to the piglets I guess? Now I am looking for a healthy diet....do you eat this often lady?
How do you like my Asparagus video?
"And we so fancy over here, I got a special plate!" Very funny, and thanks for making this video! I bought some asparagus today and plan to steam it up tonight!
I've only watched 40 sec. of this video and already I'm in love with this woman...and her cooking!
You are lame and pathetic. Have fun in your superficial life.
funny lol
love it, thank you!
Thanks for the instructions!  Cooking mines now!
Jeeze....can't even watch an asparagus video without the keyboard warriors
your recipe is sweet and simple thanks for sharing, the only thing im adding is fresh minced garlic :9
@Zakariah1971 Youre morbidly stupid and have no character....what good is being a great shape when insight you are rotten and perverse and rude?  like bad breathe we cant stand your rude public comments.  Grow the heck up....10/10 times you'll look at an anorexic chick and say absolutely nothing.  What should you tell her?  You dont speak to people like this on the street so please dont speak to people like this online unless youre just a coward.  smh
@Zakariah1971  come on bro do you really got to diss on athor people becuz you have the time of day to make fun of her? Your pathetic bro
JENNY CRAIG TIME!!!!
Stop truth telling? Never! This woman has morbid obesity! 40 day waterfast ASAP!
@Zakariah1971 stop being mean
Never take cooking advice from an obese person.  Fat as a damn PIG
Once you boil green veggies you lose nutrients to water unless you Drink the water in that pot also those asparagus are as nutritious as a Big Mac... Proof is fact she is as day as a damn pig
@Zakariah1971  not true. protein doesn't dissolve in water for example
yay
All the nutrients are in the water fools
Thank you soo much! My first time making Asparagus, and you helped me make it.
Thank you maam.
@BleuWaterStones NICE
For some reason all i pictured was her chopping her finger off when she cut the asparagus
@MhmmAngelo same with the tortilla halloween chips thats are black and orange..i pooped neon colors
Thank you!
Asparagus makes your poo a different color :P
thanks.. a lot... before icehockey training. I always had problem what to feed him.. today lesson is so nice.. you are so nice friendly teacher..bye bye
Wow! I'm a University student trying to broaden my cooking knowledge so to speak and I didn't have a clue on how to cook these. I didn't know that it would be this simple! Thank you!
I love your accent! Thanks for the recipe tip!
Thanks so much for this video.  I was able to cook a nice meal for my wife!
Thanks!
I  Am About To Cook This Right Now Thank You So Much I Am A Single Parent  (Dad) And I Wanna Cook My Little Girl Something Special Thank You For Ur Help And God Bless You
do we really have to cut the end...we cant eat that?
Yay. I'm cooking lemon cream pasta with chicken and I will be adding the asparagus as a side. Wohoo. Thank you.

fancy plate... aka, butter dish
Thanks so much..love that southern accent ..
Love this video! I feel so much better about steaming them! You are very helpful. Thanks!!
no no no thank you ma'm
you are funny. i think that you are great :)
Thanks for the vid
away to give it a go for my tea tonight with chicken chazour
taste like penis
thanks it helped alot
i actually googled how to cook asparagus and watched this haha you're such a happy cook
awww!
Your kitchen is neat!! Its like in the 80s
needs more bacon
that looks good :)
what do they taste like? I'm having them with roast chicken tonight.
thanks for the video!
Easy way to cook asparagus and very good!! Just had some for dinner.. Thanks for posting.
Thanks for posting!  Never knew how to cook asparagus...now I do!
@chrisdorsh She did wash it, and said so near the beginning of the video. Pay closer attention before making unfounded remarks.
@kokafones Oh man, really? Someone has misinformed you. The tips are the most nutrient-dense and tastiest part of the asparagus. People tend to cut the other ends off because the very ends are usually too fibrous to be enjoyed.
this sounds great!  i'm gonna give it a try tonight!  :]
@songa520  actually u prbly shld kosher them like u shld all ur fruit and veggies
You sure love pink, dontya?
Where are you from? Your accent is amazing!
I love your accent.....and your cooking! YUM!
does the water have to already be boiling before putting in the asparagus?
Make your own garlic butter and pour over them !!!....Even better.
My fave veg!! I use a special asparagus pot. You stand them upright in it and the stalks are simmered but the tips are steamed. Great tip for cutting off the ends! Try them wrapped in parma ham (prosciutto?) brushed with butter and roasted for 5 minutes.
@mikestokes1 Hi, thanks for the info, do you submerge them in water while cooking them?
@mikestokes1 Well I know that NOW :)
@steakimdone but a lot less tasty
It's not steamed. It's boiled!
@kokafones Oh my goodness, they are the best part.
@AndrewIWA Thanks for lwtting us knowl, and thanks for watching!
@songa520 Yes, we rinsed them in cold water.
Were they washed before being cooked?
I didn't know that you ate the buds at the top.  I've been cutting them off!
my favourite part:   "...goofball Camra-maaan...." loop it and LOL.
u r darling, mwahhhh!!!!
we so fancy over here i even got a fancy plate.. hahaha
Thanks for the tutorial. I'm planning to cook mahi mahi with asparagus on the side tonight.
