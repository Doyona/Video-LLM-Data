A great video and a bit of humour 😎🇦🇺
I've never seen somebody use a bungee cord and not know what they're called. Silly foreigners, make me laugh.
No 3 👍
Say Gurl, Whats *The Name Brand and Manufacturer for that Camo Tarp?* I Want a *10×10 Waterproof, Lightweight, Durable, Quiet, Stealthy Tarp!* And Easy to roll up a move quickly if Need Be!! Those *Blue Tarps (like at WALMART)* are ok, They just *Heavy an LOUD* While Moving!  *_I need one that I can haul around on my Backpack._*
Efficient and funny! Fantastic video for us females!😹👍
เสาอยู่ด้านใน มันกินเนื้อที่ครับต้องแบบนี้⛰️🎣& 🧶/⛰️☝️😅!เสาร์เฉียงปักไว้ข้างนอก
Brilliant - good explanation of set ups
Please add a link to written instructions in the description.
Super beautiful, charming, cool girl subbed, best regards, the scene with the spider was great, well done to the cameraman
We call them stretchy rope thingies... Bun-Gee Cords. Thanks for the tarp tips. Glad I found you again... seems like YouTube dropped my subscription  :(
I would suggest taking a bottom tarp to keep your bedding dry and to keep insects from crawling over you. Also,  if you have trees I would suggest lifting your tarp tents from the top via a ridge line between two trees, so you don't have limited space because of the trekking poles.
Entering the triangle pyramid made me laugh. I'm so immature
Great tarp set up demonstration
Using a bungee cord is a brilliant idea ✔👍
Nice, thanks for sharing this ideas!
Génial les croquis! Ont resent la touche feminine, beaucoup plus complète et détaillé! Bravo
Why no new vids. I miss your vids.
very interesting forest there is moss everywhere.
THANK YOU!!!! Sorry about the all caps but I've watched half a dozen videos showing this tarp set up and they all have awful camera angles and less than helpful directions of 'now peg here' where?!  The little diagram showing a floor plan is so useful! Thank you again!
I liked the 3rd also
Keep on hiking girl !
Check a BEAK FLY tarp tent, That one is much easy.
Like the first set up, the second brings all the disadvantages of a tent, it will be a lot colder due to enclosing in the condensation from breathing
very good video. thanks.
Brilliant video why am I only seeing this 6 years later
Do you still make videos
Thank you.for the video. I most enjoyed the fun music.
Thanks bunch and really enjoyed your last option,  half way open set up. 👍
Hi Maiu, thank you a lot. Have a nice day.
you can use pine cone knot instead of pole, place pine cone or rock or chewing toy inside then tie it from outside, you can place it any where and tie it into tree
Opens video. Ooh dog! Immediately hits the button. Then watches video...Very good! Love the schemes. That's a very useful addition!
I love your presenting style- you make it all seem fun rather than an army exercise which so many Bush craft people do. You have a new subscriber.
Exzellent 👍
Would love to see your sleep system and is there any security you use to keep your dog from running off in the middle of the night? I haven't tried tarp camping with my dog yet, but I'm worried he is going to bolt for an animal or a night time hiker. 😄 He usually sleeps very well but there was one time he tried to charge through my tent at an animal.
You are very beautiful. 🥰
Thanks for a cool video. I like your last setup and will try it. Subscribed!
Bungee cord(the string thingy) lol
Thanks for sharing,that was quiet instructive and entertaining
Keren aku suka 😍🤩👌☕😁
Watched all of it
I've been researching tarp setups and this popped up on my feed. Was very informative, but most importantly, very amusing. The number 2 setup looks like the tarp gave birth to you ...
I agree !  Save space and weight in your backpack , bring a tarp .  Good video 👍👍
This appeared on my Youtube feed. lol. All the best for Sweden.
Adorable.....love the accent....
I'm new in tarp setup, i find in your video lot of semplicity i love it, you make it very easy to understand :) good work
Hello, looks like I found a new friend for all of this. Ok, I'll try to see you in some videos 🙂
Excellent video and thank you 👍😀
Молодец!
😍
I often use the pyramid shelter for cold weather, (the second one) and UT does great for helping keep wind out and some of your body heat in, but as you proposed, it does indeed collect condensation. A ton of it. But when the weather is below freezing it's not a bad tradeoff for the extra warmpth.
Great video, really useful with drawing note pad. What a wonderful accent.
Love the tarp tent building instructions. Keep it up my friend!
Good idea what you did with the pole. Wrapping it with a bungee.
Hehe, I had fun watching this! Your personality is great and I learned some things!
One day I will find a wife like this
Thanks for your time it helped!!
Lovely xxxxxx
Still like this video :) I can recommend the "Lanshan 1 flame´s creed"!!! I´m superhappy, costs around 100$, 900g, supersmall packing size, but big enough for me (1,92m) plus 45l backpack in the apsis,and it was waterproof in heavy rain on a mountain, Got it in khaki (a kind of brown), fits very good in autumn forests :)
I really like your drawing it helps so much 😊 your right the price of tents are not worth buying any more. A tarp and a net is the way I'm going for now on.
Really useful video.
Thank you for sharing 👌🏼
Cool.  There's me thinking "I wonder what ways I could use my poles with a tarp" searches YouTube and I need look no further as this is the top of the list. Thanks.
Very good video. Subscribed. Hello from Louisiana USA !
Try the "DD hammocks" 3x3 Tarp or bigger,.  19 attachment poiints, 5 on each side, and an extra 3 on the centre ridge, making 5 in total.
I thought were farting in that tarp by looking at the video thumbnail...
Hi Maiu, your tarp version 2.1 is really much better than 2.0. Thanks for the clever idea - I was looking for something like that, and now I have found it :-)  Greetings from Czechia, Prague!
i still come back to this for great set up instructions
Cool. I never thought of using poles in a tarp but it works quite well by the look of it 👍
You are really good! Thank's for this helpful and nice video! :)
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
No trees needed!👍
That first set-up is very nice. If the weather gets bad you could close those "wings" and restake to the front and you'd have an almost tent-like set up. Very nice. Also, the "rubbery" thing is called a "bungy."
Great video, that spider tho 🥴
Bad video - unless you've pitched a tarp many times before
One of the most important things that all of these style of videos don't mention is facing. Always put the low end into the average wind direction so it doesn't fill from the front & rip your tarp off you in the middle of the night. Experienced hikers would know these things but new folks not so much.
this is great but... where did the spider go?!?!?!
Nice art, I really love your style. Some bigger paintings would be nice to hang up in my room :p
Really good fun to watch video.....  Very enjoyable & instructive. 👍🏼
5:48 "Just put a trecking pole here" - pole tip penetrates the tarp. You are really funny hahaha
It's a bungee cord, the stretchy thingy,lol, you're awesome. 😁
if you are camping i think you should make trenches like a moat so that if it rains you won't get flooded
So glad you're still making videos, I really enjoy them :)
I think I just fell.in.love
Very nice video. First suggestion get yourself some paracord and/or bankline. You have plenty of trees in your area, trekking poles are superfluous and taking up interior space.       Set up a ridge line between 2 trees to pitch tarp under. Place a small smooth object (ie a large marble, single tightly rolled sock, 1 inch diameter rubber ball, etc..) where you would place your tent pole on inside of tarp. Loop paracord around bottom of object outside of tarp, and use Ridgeline to lift tarp without a pole. A similar method can be used to move the second trekking pole or a y branch at the back outside with additional paracord. A tent with no poles inside. Also places less stain on tarp than a pole trading to poke through it.
Super!!!
merci pour vos démonstrations je n'avais jamais essayé la dernière, bonne continuation
the graph paper diagrams are super useful. many thanks.
nice silent movie piano music
Flexible string rope thingy. This is the terminology Americans used when they were naming the Rocky mountains and yellow stone 🤣
10 foot by 10 foot
what is the size of the sheet ?
Great video ! Thank you for sharing !!
Flexible rubber string 😂😂😂that's made my day
i will use this configuration, looks great!
Very beautiful
lol just save up and get a tent to protect you from the elements, solo 3 season tents of decent quality aren't more than 170 to 200 usd.
Well done more configurations are possible depending upon the size and make of your tarpaulin also the use of a few tarp clips can be useful.
Bravo! Super quick and super easy!!!
I love the flexible string rope thing , great statement , l.o.l , be well and take care .
“Flexible string rope thing” just so you know not criticizing! We call that (or I and the people around me do) a bungee cord in English. 👍🏻
Good to see a woman doing this too. Not many putting out vids but plenty camping
Great video! Nice tutorial!
I'm glad you're real cute, and have cute accent because if I would have heard anybody else calling a bungee cord a "flexible string rope thingy" or "rubbery thing" i would just stop watching right then and there.
Never seen someone so happy making shelters. Subscribed to see more happy videos. Thanks.
Excellent job, thank you. Subbed.
Hi! Other suggestions from me https://youtu.be/F_9io7b588s
A good video for you to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8lw64__n8M
Nice video but its called a bungee cord not a stretchy rope thing. Chring
Your tarp pitching video is so great !! Awesome!!  I subscribed your channel ! If you have time ,  please visit my aerial travel and drone channel . Have a nice day !!
What do when ground is wet
the rubber thingy is called a bungee cord :) cool videos
Wonderful demonstration!   I’m using a part of your demonstration to make a 4 season shelter for fishing in the rain and ice fishing here in Chicago, 🇺🇸 USA.        The only difference is, I’ll be using a clear tarp, so I can see  the orange floats in the water when they go down      I’ll be using a small propane heater to take the chill off ( fishing late October/ November ).     Trying to get outdoors and make up for the lost time in 2019.         I had a beautiful brown Finnish Spitz 🐕 who used to love going on long walks in the woods, and fishing with me.        🎉Your enthusiasm is contagious and you have a lovely smile.         I know why, it’s because it’s so relaxing and energizing to be outdoors and doing what you love with no pressures       Keep up the good work!   💯👍🏆  🐕
You are fabulous. Love this vid. New subscriber! Love from Texas!!
very poor designs and waste of tarp
I'd like to see you setting up a tarp when it's starting to rain, gusty windy & or on the kind of ground you'll encounter when out hiking not is a soft backyard lawn.
Great video, love your enthusiasm. Sub'd.  I see from your video list that you've hiked in New Zealand - looking forward to watching them.
tents are no reason. tarp is less expensive.  walmart has inexpensive tarp
Very well presented with a bright personality, Your dog adds a nice touch .
have you got a link for your tarp please
Open tetra and several versions of 3x3 DD tarp tent, with a smaller or bigger floor. Greetings from Poland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P_SSGzuHA8  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8PhIHySqac  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOYGeffGGK4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogk_5fv99Sk  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdWjA0q9yUw
I definitely would go with #3 because unless you have set up on top of a small mound, you're going to be sleeping on wet ground. Been there, done that! Never Again! If you're in a forest, I would take no less than 2 tarps and at least one ground sheet. I'd set up #3 and the second tarp over the top to both protect the open front and channel the rain away from the tent. I used to go camping in the mountains and we would stretch a huge tarp up high (at least 7 foot) between the trees slightly sloping down hill, then we would set up our tents underneath it. We still needed a lot of padding under our sleeping bags to keep warm (a futon works Great!), but our whole camp would stay dry. I miss it but am too old and physically unable to do so now, so enjoy it while you can!
Great job bud, have you actually used any of the versions you demonstrated? And if so which one was the best overnight?  Cheers,
Nicely explained. Thank you.  For me, I'd definitely take something to lie on.
Good job, however a second tarp would be a floor
Come in my tent  ⛺️ lol
Just came back from my first night under a tarp, it was raining all the time. Thanks for your video, it was very usefull.  (I had a horrible night btw but I was expecting it, practice makes perfect)

String rope is called bungee cord
Love the video.  'Rubbery thing with hook" is "bungee cord' ... but I like your name for it better!!  😀
I enjoyed your enthusiasm and love of the outdoors.
The tarp movement is so absurd. Why should you go camping with half a tent? There are plenty of regular tent which are solid, light and compact, for an acceptable price. For example Décathlon forclaz.
Now i go and take a hike!
this lady is adorable!
You are awesome . Number 3 is my favorite !!
A rain trench all the way around the tent/shelter.
I’ve tried that 3 sided pyramid.  The flaw in folding that flap to the inside is if seepage occurs, it is now directed to the inside and that open edge pretty much allows water to drip on that whole side.  I found it works better folded to the outside.
I've been camping since forever. Blah,blah,blah,    You are adorable.
Go take a hike yourself,🤣🤣so many blokes from the waist down,well done you,have a look at the DD Tarp videos,there are so many different configurations,just to suit your environment,as it  does change from place to place
Hi. I have a military tent, but it's not square, but rectangular, do you think you can do the same with it?
I would get lost with you in the forest bushcraft girl
She's fricken beautiful tho isn't she?
Great tutorial, thanks for sharing.
750 thousand views wow, I remember that was about three hundred totaal :))  I've been focussed on climbing for the past two years and didn't get much hiking done. New channels have emerged and yours has just exploded, congratz. Last thing I remember is you were preparing for Tibet(?) with your mom. Or maybe you were already there? I have some catching to do. Nice :-)
This is exactly what I was looking for !
Fantastic video, I learned a lot. Thank You ever so much.
Maiu seems like a fun and rational hiking partner!
In your last set up... Better make sure you don't poke a hole in the tarp with that hiking pole... The rubber top is okay but cover both ends of the pole with socks to be safer.
Hello and thank you from Yukon !
Hmm. Hadn't considered Tarp tenting. I'm impressed.
I love tarp camping. Recommend Borah gear. Luna is a cool pup. Thanks
Luna takes her job of security very seriously!
Your stretchy rope is a Bungee Cord :)
Need a tarp on the ground to lay on or your gonna get wet from the wet ground
J'adore cette vidéo mademoiselle. Elle est pleine de bon conseil. Salutation.
What a lovely women .......to go camping with so how about it
4:50 That's how I was born, except covered in blood and screaming...
Thanks. They look great. Like the music.
I loved this video! Respect from the UK :))
👍
What tarp are you using in this video?
So awesome! I'm glad you showed me how I could get around that extremely heavy or extremely expencive tent on my hikes! :)
Looks like pitches for short people
Take Heed and Behold For I have just imagined my perfect wife Into existence A Beautiful Creation Indeed A Viking no doubt.
👍🏻👍🏻😍😍
hej hej, which tarp is it pls?
Your rubbery thing is called a bungy or bungee (pronounced bunjee) strap or cord. Great vid, packed with information, but simplified. Good work, young lady!
5:18 this is interessting
I can't make head or tail of this bllsht display.
Love from Greece.  Spiders are friendly too,here :)
Hi  Malu. For the back of the tent you might try a 2foot stake on the outside and running a line over it and then staking it away from the tent. It gives you a little more room inside. 👍👍👍 YouTube channel Survival Theory has great videos of tarp building 🙂
The stretchy thing is called 'bungee cord'.
Awesome video.
Beautiful and doesnt need to be half naked to make a video....A+++
4.50 happ birthday😂🤣
On the second setup watch that the bungee cord hook does not puncture your tarp other wise you gonna get wet.
Major comic relief.  Life is so goot unt hezee.  Now, go take a hike yourself, too.  😅😂😜
nice video seems like a totally awesome person also
Excellent...love your enthusiasm :-)
Nice tarp shelter video. Like the dog too. So to pile,,,Bungee cord or rope (sometimes spelled bungie), also known as a shock cord.(pronunciation in English: ˈbʌn.d͡ʒi
Geez lady you’re killing me it’s a bungee cord!
Nice set ups keep practicing there is hundreds of tarp set ups and you're a great teacher
How can anyone give this video a thumbs down? I think you did a very nice job, thank you for sharing.
I love your accent <3
Love this one! Tarp Class 101!
That was fun!!!  Thank You!!!
Geniously!! I guess your professoin is egeneer.
Very good thanks
Teşekkür ederim 🙏❤️💐🇹🇷
AHHH the spider!
Great vid
In tarp set up number 2, you can pull the door flaps out ( open) and that will allow fresh air inside. If it starts raining in the night, unhook the two bungee cords( rubberie things) from the door and close it up the way you did. That is my favorite tarp tent. BTW: I LOVE the camouflage pattern on your tarp.
Nice video! You have a nice personality for making videos. Thanks for work and the video!
Very clever. I'm wondering what you might do with a bigger tarp. Perhaps a 4M x 5M? Or a 5M x 6. Perhaps a floor AND flaps to act as a folding door?
the stretchy thing is called a "bungee cord" in the USA.  Every time you Calling it a stretchy thing, my brain was like " oh, yeah, woman talk". anyway, good job, hike free and God bless.
Very inreresting, do you speak Russian?
Very cool. Thank you
Great job. Thanks a lot from Virginia.
Very very nice! Your presentation was excellent and informative! Thank you from California!
Oh you are brave! I like to be closed in completely !
Masz męża?
Stretchy thing is "bungle cord" in US. 🤠👍
Don't know why I haven't subscribed before. I like "Bushcraft" channels, but, only ones with no drama or conceit. Yours are straight forward. If there is a mistake or a modification it's shown and how to correct it. It doesn't hurt that the camera likes you. Keep on keeping on
20 extra hotness points  for accent.
Thank you! Well done.
Love the way you sketch out the floor plan as well, very helpful
They are called an okey strap in AUSTRALIA
Beautiful and smart
Женюсь!!!
And if you have two tarps?
Use the money you save from buying a tent on 50 cans of bug spray.
I want to go
Great video. Might I just add a very beautiful presenter. Just for your information the rubbery thing is called shock cord. But that makes it even cuter. Oh wow I just saw you were from Estonia. I've been to Tallin and met Taavi Roivas when he was Prime Minister.
She's a Cutie
Good setups. Have you used a hammock to sleep in? It gets you off the damp ground, and they are a joy to sleep in?  Here is a tarp setup for two trees that has adjustable cordage pre-tied. I took classes from Mike, and use this tarp setup on almost every camping trip.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjMmla9DSzo
1) I'm using the triangle (fully enclosed)  tent on my next overnight if the weather sucks 2) this is the cutest video I've ever seen
Wife material!
The rubbery ropey thing is called a bungee cord. 🧐
Damn grl u r perfect....a sexy beautiful grl that likes to hike n camp
Thanks for the Vid, i've used the 1st one before, but the 3rd i havent seen and looks like a good one for hot weather but with a risk of rain , going to try that next time (I think I'm too tall for the fully enclosed one, but will try it and see), I love the fact you are not up your own arse like on some of the vids i've watched. Also, nice tip with the bungee, simple but effective!
Oh Hiker in Estonia...you are so adorable :))
You are super cute! Can I be your dog? ;) Great vids!
estonia looks like a beautiful country
Why would any one else be in the woods where you are ?
Thanks for sharing  👍
No need to back pack alone Pretty Lady...
Well done bid but already done (plus other stuff) from papa hiker using DD gear.  Mind you, she is much easier on the eye than said papa hiker.  Can’t hurt to show it all again though
All night long.
Do it slowly, please, thanks
Do you sleep in a water proof bivy?
Some useful ideas here. Have you tried using a hammock? That's my preferred method. Hammock, tarp, a few bits and bobs to make things faster. Job done in about 2 mins, once practiced. But always looking for tips and trick.
rubbery thing, string rope thingy.      i think i love you          it's a bungee
i was getting bored until you mentioned the string rope thingy   hahaha I understand
You are a genius!
The dog is cute
HAHAHAA @ the spider and horror music. That was very funny
I love your tarp ideas!!  Question:   Ifn you're setting up in a wet area, where the ground is already damp or WET, what do you do for a floor. or something to keep your sleeping mat and bag dry.... from getting wet??   Terrific video... thanks for sharing.               Ax
kind of ugly. just the way i like it.
That was brilliant to use the bungy cord (that's what those rubbery cords are called) to wrap around the tarp and handle of the hiking pole. You've got a very pretty dog! I like your diagrams showing the stake out points and stuff.
Really enjoyed the video. I use a tent made from a tarp on my sailing dinghy for overnight sleeping. Condensation is always a problem on very cold nights.
Great video, many thanks.   I'm wondering about tarp camping as an alternative to carrying a tent when cycle touring for the reasons you described, and also because I'll be in Japan where I'll want airflow at night.   I'm curious: when you are in a forest, why would you make a free standing structure?
nice video, you are cute, smart and funny .
great presentation : )
Last shelter has a string on the front running down right where you'd want to make your fire.  I prefer running a line between 2 trees.
Quite interesting presentation. I never thought of using a tarp either.
What's  up you people  and dog it's   just dog dog dog
I think I'm in love. Those other things are called Bungees.
Приятная девушка.Молодец.
string rope thingy is an official term
I'm confused by the dramatic music at 4:15. Was that a spider? a tick?
Great video. Thanks for sharing.
Maybe you can make two units one smaller to be on the inside of the larger one and then you have insulation that would be a good idea I think periods are cheap enough to build so when I go for a double layer of super insulation you always put leaves in between
I met 3 girls from Estonia in Alaska and thought it was funny for without having watched yr video I would have never heard of Estonia.
I hate to break it to anyone, but that's not a normal tarp as a normal tarp has tiny but noticable holes in it for breathing.
Bungee-Cord is the rubbery thingi. ;)
Awesome   Personality
And all those nice trees in the background to stretch a line between  and have a nice A frame shelter.
For the bar in the middle, it is worth taking a tennis ball and cutting a two-centimeter hole in it. So you can put this ball on the upper end of the bar. This will avoid a damage of your tarp.
Great presentation and to the point. Thumbs up.
Very informative video and that is one Beauitful forest!
Omg you are so cute 😃🤠❤👍🏻
Yep the other poster was right the rubber string thingy is a bungee cord.  Rubber string thingy or however you said it was a pretty good description though. I agree with the other poster who pointed out that you need some protection from the damp ground especially if it starts raining. Thanks for the video though I like the first two set ups as most of the places where I camp don't allow real camp fires.
I hadn't thought of that second one, that's a pretty good idea. It's probably better to fold the excess on the outside of the "tent" instead of the inside. Bringing it to the inside would actually let some water in.
I use an army bivy bag and a grabber space blanket. The tarp is set up as a lean to with the reflective side down. I make a dakota fire pit in front.
No, she is not irritating, it's just most likely you should be watching someone else.
She is gonna be wet. Rain water flows within grass and some times flow thick. You need protection underneath you as well that if you have cold rain at night, you might as well stand outside and just take it.
Thia lady is fuking irritating
Watch'um Girl
great video.thanks
On the picture... you are shitting or what?
Great video, very entertaining!
Use two tarps.
Where was the tarp ? I watch the video over and over and never saw it. Gonna watch it several more times looking for it.😉
Flexible string rope thingy? We call them bungee cords but I like your name for them.
Wow. Susan Dey does survival shelter training :p Oh my. I was about to comment about spiders in my lawn when I tested similar for practice...then I saw 4:11. Good thing yours looked like a 'false daddy long leg' at least in blur. Mouths too small to bite humans. Hopefully is what that was :/ Thanks for the vid. I hadn't seen shelter #2 before. Will have to try that one next. Sans spiders tho
I am in love , that dog is so adorable
Estonia looks like a forest from a fairytale. I like the look of third set up the best. Set up that way it might capture some heat from a campfire to keep you warm at night too. Good job.
i forgot where i saw it, definitely not my idea, but ive seen someone pad the trekking pole with dirty socks to prevent damages to the tarp
https://youtu.be/bRBtof2pAqI Nice video thanks check this one out,,  maybe you've seen it.
I want one of them 😁
Nice dog.
Great video! Good info on tarp setup, use the plow setup myself a lot!! 🙂
I don't subscribe to very many YouTube sites, only those with good information. You just qualified for one more follower. 👍
a very interesting women an cute as a button n smart
Brilliant video, the bungee cord (rubber band) is a great idea.
At 7:10, for that configuration, with part of it under you, you'd be OK if the wind stayed in the same quarter and you put the fold upwind and the open side down.  But in severe wind one time and wet snow, another, I just made myself a decent debris bed out of what was available, threw down the tarp, with the sleeping bag on slightly less than 1/2 of it and then just folded the other half over the sleeping bag and done.  The only thing you're really missing would be bug netting for mild weather.  I've used a lot of 5'x8' tarps for that.  More than enough length and just enough width to fit around your sleeping bag with a little extra.    An 8' x 10' (feet.  1 foot is about 1/3 meter (a little less)).  So I dunno.  3 meter x 2.5 meter?  But that's pure solo.  With a dog, you want a little extra, but you're a wee thing, so I imagine the dog could snuggle in and you could make sure they're not suffocating.    It's good to know how to improvise.  You're gifted.  One of the joys of getting older is you can save your pennies up over time to GET that nice tent you wanted.
Much more elegant use of a tarp to make a shelter.  You've a good eye for this stuff.  I've seen a lot of bushcraft videos, where somebody throws up a tarp and get very little protection from much more square-footage.  That hexagonal setup would be much more snug than most 1-tarp shelters I've seen, with or without a fire.
great video! thanks :)
Kas sa õmblesid ise või saab neid kusagilt?
I really like your videos. They're very interesting.
Hard to believe that such a significant woman hasn't found the right hiking companion. It's only a matter of time. The odds are overwhelmingly in your favor. By the way, I think your second tarp setup is called a pyramid configuration.
Cute avec toi je vais  n'importe  où bisous
This is the first video I ever saw of you. God, you're fascinating!!!
Nice simple illustration with drawing insert... Kudos... Good teacher!
I prefer a plow point with an A-frame. But, you would have to take a hand saw and maybe an axe with you for that. I am a bit bush crafty. Lol
👍 amazing what you can do with a tarp!!! Good one !!
Bungee cord sweetheart.
For the first shelter you can place the smaller pole behind the tent. Extend it fully and connect it with the loop where the pole usually stands. All you have to do now is to tense the pole with paracord to the ground. The Tarp will be lifted up and you have more room to move inside ;)
all the tent set up is not user friendly.... good luck try it with more options
Hi from Maryland in the US
Cute pup
The elastic cords are called Bungee Chords and have many, many uses  both outdoors and indoors and great for attaching to Luna so she doesn't wander far.
Hi What kind of tarp is it? also what are the dimensions? very nice video
You did that perfectly!
.... im a genious .... haha
You have pretty voice.👍
Came for the tarps, subbed for the accent
Thank you. You are very good at this.
There is nothing that I could say about the tarp shelters you did, they all look good. My choice would have to be for number 1. This person (@UCagta6A5CURzTgHx8FJ4FVQ) added some mylar reflective sheets to his tarp and I think that was a really good idea.
OMG!!! MARRY ME PLEASE!!! You are gorgeous! And your eyes...WOW!!!
I love you so much
When it rains, i stay home
Guess if there’s anybody I want to be stuck out in the woods with it would be her
OK, I am new at tarps but don't you get wet from the ground when it rains?
Where did u get the tarp.
A women with brains 😀
You're absolutely Gorgeous.  I'd love to take you along side for backpacking and canping.😘💯
I wish YouTube could block terrible, annoying music.
Nice Brain!
Very cool movie from a very nice lady. Good work and you could use two tarpaulins, the other for a floor. The trekking poles have more than a single use too  Subscribed*
would you really spend a night alone in the forest in that tarp?   Scary  :O
Greetings from the Himalayas!  Your videos are not just pleasing to watch they are really informative too. These tarp setups were cool!  im gonna try #3 on my meteor shower camp this week.
Can i suggest if going lightweight you use just sticks and not ready made pegs and walking sticks. Much lighter then ! Great vid on the different ways to use a tarp, Can i suggest a couple of space blankets instead of the ready made pegs and walkers. For then your ready for cold n rain. Oh and always have at hand true 550 paracord. So my test to you. Two space blankets, One tarp and paracord and one knife with all you can muster in the wilds. Good luck ! subed !
Great video i will try these set ups when i finally get round to going hiking. I could listen to your voice all day
beautiful woman
Realy nice eyes
I've found my soulmate.
nice set  ups, but if you want to stay dry when it rains, you will need a floor or something waterproof to keep you off the wet  ground.
Nice work 👌 Its called a bungee strap 😉
Excellent video sista! Subbed!!! Feel free to check out my channel
Done!
I like the schemes you did, pretty clear!
Brilliant
=)
I absolutely love this video - I love the way you present as well - Fabulous! I have recently purchased a Tarp - so found this really helpful.... (take a look at my video on my channel!) I will do a video myself based entirely on trying out your configurations! Great stuff -Thank you! Got yourself another subscriber  😜
We call that springy cord a bungee cord.  "Bun G"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0pMpoguf5g       Great video! And don't forget you could do this with the tarp also!
CLAPP, CLAPP, CLAPP, ESPECIALLY THE SECOND ONE BY CREATING A WINDOW WITH MOSQUITO NET/VENTILATOR.
It was fun watching this again. You have improved a lot in your video making in two years
2 thumbs up, brilliant. ☺💙
Nice job
Cool video ! Excellent job !
Please make a video for the 2x3 m tarp.
3:46 looks like a wizards sleeve!  But dont camp alone , i'll go with you... that russian accent is HOT ;)
I like the way you are speaking. Sweet and amazing person. Best greetings from munich.
Great stuff! Thank you.
Thank you for this marvelous video! You covered so much information in 7 minutes and the drawing insets help very much. See you on the trail!
What a joke, lol dose the dog like peanut butter?
Ok lmfao, what is 3 meter
Almost like Benny Hill.
This was the first video I saw of you and then I watched all your other movies .... I'm glad I did that because I sometimes have to laugh at you. Your movies are really nice.
loved the video
The rubber thingy is called bungee cords
You are so damn adorable.............
Cool channel, subbed!
That was awesome!
I’ve been watching a lot of tarp set up videos lately. While I’ve seen most of these set ups the little drawings do help make them easier to understand. I found your videos easy to watch and entertaining. Great looking dog also !
My kind of girl😍, Stay safe sis😚
I have all the gears to do the tarp configurations you show but I live in Tucson and we have nasty critters so I am not very willling to do this with my 7 yr old son for now. How to prevent snakes, spiders and scorpions from coming to our tent? Thanks for the video.
Maybe carry a small inflatable sleeping mat as well, it will keep you off ground and warm in case you break a leg and have to stay until help comes
what a great video, i usually just strike mine low to the ground with both ends open, but you have to think about wind direction.
What kind of tarp are you using?
vaginal
your funny
That flexible "rope thingie" in the US we call them bungies. (Pronounce, Bun-G's)
Great video. I liked when you drew out your tarp designs. Now to the important part, come to America and let’s get married. 😊
I like Your G-point Layout the best! ;)
Those are bungie cords good video
I've just only within the last while found your channel... This particular video was brilliant... I think making these vids much as I do having a sense of humour makes it first class.... Well done great vids
Thank !!!
She likes six pegs 😂
C.. "What" prevents tarantulas and snakes from slithering in at the bottom since it does not go all the way to the ground?  "How" do you keep them "out"?
Thank you very much.  Very  useful.
Very very nice.
Why the heck are Estonian women so cute??
So I’ve been seeing a lot of these tarp shelters videos pop up on my YouTube feed and I feel I have to ask the question at least once, why only one tarp? I’ve always packed two tarps (or teamed with another person so we have two tarps between us) so that I can set up a weatherproof floor under the shelter (or additionally to set ontop of a debris floor for padding and insulation) the second tarp would need to be the same size or thickness just something that you could pull the edge up along the inside of the shelter top to keep run off rain away
tolles Video Grüße aus Germany
Very informative and entertaining 👍 you make me want to go hiking 😎
Thank you for putting this up.  You have some great ideas and variations. I'm going to show this to my Venture Crew to give them some ideas for setting up light weight and inexpensive camp.
this is future for Americans .
You could carry 2 extra hair bands (hair scrunchies) instead of the bungee to save some weight.  A couple of times around the trekking handle and you're done!
You are so hot
GET A ULTRA LITE SINGLE SKIN PLAY TENT USE THAT UNDER THE TARP presto best of both worlds
Bungie cords are very useful  thanks for the post
You are genius 😉
reverse birth at 3:43
you and your dog are cute
a simple A frame is easiest! 2 poles, with the tarp stretched either side. The length is more than enough for a normal sized person with kit
Lovely voice, I could listen to her talk a long time🍺👍
the rubbery thing is called a bungy. Nice vid.
Love the way you did your video. Two others to consider is the diamond/plow shelter and a tarp hammock (especially if you have 2x tarps; 1 for roof & 1for hammock)
Excellent recommendations! I'm sure I'll apply one of those for fishing days !! Greetings from Ushuaia, Argentina!
Great video...good content and excellent delivery.. Cheers
Very much like your configurations. Subbed.
Nice video, informative, energetic and fun to watch.  Showing the diagrams is a great idea!  Do you mind telling the dimensions of the tarp and your height so that I'll know how my 6'1" frame will fit(185.5 cm)?  Also, I really like dogs. What breed or breeds is Luna.  She certainly looks like a shepherd breed or shepherd mix, maybe part German Shepherd Dog or maybe a breed I've yet to discover.
I am going to go hiking in Estonia in May, and I love camping under tarps. Glad to see they are useful there. Great video.
Koo 2nd funny over all very nice
Second one looks like you enter a giant green vagina ,haha .genus vid more creative then I
I used the first tent setup once, when on a hike with a friend. It's a really awesome setup. More than enough space for 2 grown men + backpack. Only downside was a medium buildup of condensation. Not enough to wet the sleeping bags though.
be honest you found that *SPIDER* during editing .... lol ....      I would have BURN down the entire forest just to rid myself of that thing
Yet another comment stating how attractive you are.
thanks nice vedio . good tips.
They're called "bungee cords" or "bungee straps" in America 😀
I have to get one of those rubbery things.   Yaaa
С каких это пор эстонцы начали на английском гутарить?  Хайкин в Эстонии, это примерно так же как вокруг столба с ночевкой :) Estonia - GREAT european country! No doubt!
Only one comment ... More video.  You seem fun.
Wot a ray of sunshine you are (and I imagine you're quite a force of nature too👍)
I've watched 4 timea this week. Thank You.
lil tip.. tie a rope between 2 trees. throw the tarp over the rope. stake it down. done.
aaaaa!!  hahaha! "String Rope Thingy"  ? Your cute but your killin me. Lets go camping. i love to laugh.
Girl of my dreams,, tarp, thingy x
"Flexible string rope thingy", also called a bungee cord. If only my Estonian was 10% as good as her English. Lovely video. I have always wanted to visit Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.
I just watched your video on Tarp Set up, back in 2016.  Hove you continued to use your tarp and if so, what advantages have you enjoyed and what disadvantages have you discovered??   Your evaluation would be wonderful.         Love yas..........  Ax
Hey hello, Thank you for your ideas. But : 1. When you don`t tight your tent at all sides strongly, in causes of rain, water will drop inside. 2. When you bind your tent around your walking stick with your blue elastic, water will also drop in.     So : the tent must always be tighten at all sides!! 3. When you use your walking sticks of support your tent, turn them upside down. Because: the top side has a smaller contact to      the tent, what also beware you of dropping water inside. I don`t think, that you want go out in the little of the rain by heavy rain!! 4. When you wrinkle inside those ports of your tent, you don`t need to protect you from wind and rain, you can sleep calm on the      ground whiteout  inside floating water during the night.  As you demonstrated as well. 5. What you forgot to say :  Always align the door to east. or north. So you will never be trapped by the rain, also by heavy wind.     To find out, where ist the west, trees gives the orientation, because at the west side, trees are mostly gray darker as the rest  of        it`s bark and sometimes overgrown with moss.
Great video, I have hit the red button to support your channel.
Darling try a pop-up tent.
String rope thingy!!  Love it 😊
You, though much younger, remind me very much of my Swedish grandmother
Intelligence runs in Baltic country folks... Clever, thanks for sharing Ms. Hiker
Bungie cords.
ur voice is so nice r u marryed?
Wow!!!! Yer cute too
Wow, great video!  What charm and skills you have.
Very nice darling. Stay safe...
"I don't have the money to buy them". WANNA JOB? Hint.... Hint.... Hint.... Or if you wanna DIE of pneumonia, that's your choice, this is STUPID!
Your a sexy European chick !<3
Hiker - You didn't mention what size tarp you used.
В итоге её отымели етти в палатке
Here is the link to my tarpology video, please enjoy and some other videos you can see me camping out in them. https://youtu.be/d_-y1tsoVIE
love the music lol
Hello Please visit my youtube channel I have done a video on tarpology showing different configurations, love your videos
That stretchy rope thingy they're called bungee cords.  And they were around before bungee jumping lol...  My dad used to use those back in the seventies to strap things to his motor bike.  Great video, love it.  Some brilliant ideas there.  Thank you.
Was a cute little spider, most Australian spiders will just kill you. 😂
interesting vid
Whats the point of this video?
Nice! In Australia the rubbery thingos are called Octopus Straps, but every one calls the "Occy straps. They are very handy, but very dangerous, many people have been blinded up them when losing their grip. Please be careful that your head it out of the way. Great video.
Keep safe 👍
20 Euros is expensive? https://www.decathlon.de/zelt-arpenaz-2-personen-id_8293539.html# Still great video.
https://youtu.be/O-oKxShuDXU?t=4m13s and that's why tent is better for me :)
I tried out the second one in sub 40F weather with a 10’x12’. My dog and I slept comfortably, but (as you said) condensation was an issue. I’ve learned that tarp shelters don’t really offer much in terms of insulation. The stagnant air will combat convection and it will keep the rain off of you, but that’s about it tbh...
How do keep dry on the floor? Won’t the water just come under the edges?
With that many trees . . . Get a hammock girl . . .
I love you. Your videos are great. Snd you have a great personality.
STRING LIKE THING = BUNGEE CORD
Just about to do a 400km hike in Sweden with a tarp so THANK YOU! Really helpful.
Aku cinta padamu
The rubbery thing is called  bungee cord .... good videos
Hi from Ireland 🇮🇪, much cheaper than military basha too! A bit of tarp and trekking poles,,, cheap in Lidl lol,,,,, 😎
A beautiful smile and a very interesting video! Thank you)
Nice video
Wow! You look like a Norge shield maiden... a dark haired Kathrynn Wynnick😙
you are going...
I love your accent👍🏻
You make it look very easy and the forest looks beautiful 😊
My dog wouldn't let me work alone like that. He would try to get involved and possibly cause a lot of problems!
The moment with the spider was very funny
Thank you for this.  Fab watching you with builds 👍🏻
Beautiful forest there !
that spider.. amazing xDDD
Nice
Hey great video you have really inspired me! Like you I am an outdoor enthusiast too if you get a minute or two I would love it if you can check out my channel? Have a great day and keep up with the amazing videos
Nice videos I tend to use a simple open one side design like your last one if you have a fire with a reflector wall that is the warmest one in our winter climate.my tarp is 3x4m which gives me enough for a thermal break from the ground and moisture, I like your video format.nicely done.
Beautiful woods.
The Stretchie Thing is a, .. "Bungee Cord"...
The elastic line you had is called a bunjie cord. Or at least it is here in Canada.
Thanks for the help
Thanks, interesting... greetings from Spain Michael
yuo may lik SS Zeltbahn
Cute video, very cheap for the wallet in a pinch.  Sometimes you just have to rough it.  This is better to have instead of nothing, especially if something happens all of a sudden, you never know when you're hiking.  If it's a day hike or even a 1-2 day hike, you want to travel light.  Well done from Portland, Oregon U.S.
Good job.cool stuff.
Best of ideas. Thanks!
I enjoyed this video very much! I like the "dog space"  :-)
I just stumbles across your channel and this video.  Excellent.  Very nicely done.  Hope to see more of your work.   Best wishes... Ax
I know this is a couple of years later, but having just come upon your channel, I watched and subscribed. So, HI from the usa! And that stretchy cord is called a bungee cord.  As for me, taking two tarps is not any more of a burden than taking one. Never know what the weather will throw at you and having the ability to not be laying on bare earth is a plus to personal comfort and health. I enjoyed this and will watch your other posts.
read my blog page about what the essentials are to survive in anay situation i talk about the bare essentials not things that would be good to use im on about the absolute basics!  https://www.escapadeonline.co.uk/single-post/2018/01/22/Essential-Survival-Gear-only-the-necessities-for-survival
Great videos. Music is great!
Hey Hiker in Estonia. This video made me subscribe so I'm new to your channel. What did you use for your ground sheet and sleeping? I'm questioning whether or not to bring a tent or a tarp on my travels. Thank you. Keep sharing.
Brilliant!  You made me laugh too! Great video!
I enjoyed your video! Thanks for your efforts!
Where's ya boyfren at tho?
Yours is by far the most informative video thank you
The enter looks like a virgina.
You're not backpacking alone- you have your dog! :-)
I liked it so easy. I must try it... Tks
Pretty clever solutions! :) Time to practice!
brilliant.
Great video I just subscribed to your channel. X
I love this video!!  😊👍👍💙💖
Nice setup, well explained thank you 😁
You'll get wet from the bottom
Great job! I subscribed
Harika. Çok başarılısın. Artık Türkiyeden bir takipçin var. :)
Oh, another tip. Before constructing the tarp shelter test the ground by lying on it for flatness and comfort. The flatness is important if you use a ground sheet as you can slide if it is on an angle. Happy travels.
Nice video. I have used tarps for camping since the late 1970s. In many countries and in many different weather conditions. Like you my longest trek with a tarp was one year  and so I have a lot of experience with them. My main tip is that using bungees (the rubber cord with hooks) for some or all of the guy lines protects the tarp from even very strong winds and also from noisy flapping. I still use a tarp but these days but usually over a hammock, which gives maximum comfort and weather protection and is warmer in the snow. Happy travels!
From Argentina I say hello I would like to hike by your side, sorry for my bad english, I speak shanish, <3
it is so clear that you have never had the need to use such a thing, or you should be aware of how much moisture comes out of terrain during night!! make another video with tips to make a tarp shelter WITH FLOOR
6:25 wish there was a rear camera.
You have a natural way to make it look so easy, I will have to try it. Also, I think you have a great sense of humor.
thanks
Hahahaha @daddy long leg!!!!!
Lol love your pose!  Bending over for the fans... +1  Nice vid.
Your rubbery thingy is called a bungee cord, great vid
If you use pole as an A frame by putting a sock on end to join you give more room and no poles in middle .
Im in love :)
Very interesting video ...good to see you again! Thx for sharing
Where did you bouggt this tarp?
wheres she from ? she is   a babe !  ( not relevant i know ) lol. edit.. hiker in ESTONIA .. right..
An Army Poncho, UK or German, with a Poncho liner will make a great ground sheet for you in your tarp shelters. They are really good doing what they were designed to do too. Keeping you and your gear dry, warm and concealed. I admit to liking the German colours. Great for an outdoors person like yourself, on a budget. Good luck Estonia Hiker.
enjoyed it
Thank you. Illustrative and informative! Whilst being good fun.
wonderful video!
Hello, a use the first one and also use a a cheap tarp for a ground sheet, new sub aswel only just found your channel, take care Liam.
You are a origami magician 👍
Cool
Very clever. Those are good tips. Love your energetic approach.   I would love to see what you could do with a 4m x 4m tarp. I bet you could even arrange for a floor.  I have found nice, lightweight two person tents on ebay that weight only a tiny bit more than a tarp for $30 USD. If you are going to be out on a rainy day, a floor underneath will be a blessing.
straight to the point no stuffing around thanks for your post
Great Set Up. like the walking poles for the poles.
I enjoyed your format.  Speeding up the playback during setup makes it more interesting.  Many otherwise useful videos become boring while you wait for the demonstrator to tie knots and make minor adjustments in real time.  I am going to try your open setup when I go out with my new tarp (first time with a tarp) Thanks!
nice one
Good video, Nice tips!,  The stretchy cord you were using is called a Bungee cord,
I find this woman incredibly sexy. Off topic, I know. Sorry. Just needed to say it.
I find this woman incredibly sexy. Off topic, I know. Sorry. Just needed to say it.
Those are some really useful setups. Thanks for sharing!
good ideas.   What size is your tarp?  3m x 3m perhaps?  Another popular arrangement is called "flying wedge" which you can find on line.  Thanks for your video and pleasant smile.
Rubbery thing! LMAO It's a bungie cord! ;)
Always a pleasure watching your videos even old ones like this 😀
This was great and I love that you hike with your dog.  I kind of want to try the last two layouts with just sticks and some bungee cords. I feel like a tarp being a part of my pack is something I can put in there and forget about.  Usually the rest of the space is taken up by camera equipment.  I don't usually head out so far that I need a makeshift shelter, but it's nice to know you can make one if you need to.
I love you...
Позитивная тетушка))) мне понравилось)
Damn you are beautiful !!
Thanks for the video, super helpful
You should check out the Andrew Surka guy line video.  He shows how to use paracord and simple knots which will help you save weight in shock cord / bungee and keep the tap tight (taut?)
ive been planning in buying a simple tarp for a while.  you make it look easy so im going to get one. nice videos
nice video keep up the bushcrafting!
I wished I could give you two thumbs up!!! Well done!! I usually hammock camp, and occasionally solo tent camp. I like this idea of just a tarp and tracking poles..but I am not going to lie, I am not keen on a copperhead snake sliding into the shelter with me during summer camping. LOL I have only used the plow point setup. You showed some really nice setups. Thank You!!
I've done a lot of survival camping,carrying only bare essentials.both in winter and summer.I try to keep up on everything I can.keep on and ignore other comments.good video
bungee cord.
Very refreshing to see a woman doing "survival" stuff! Keep it up. There are a lot of other setups using tarps, my favorite is a setup which gives you a tent like structure with a floor. Kind of hard to explain in words, but here is a video of it (in spanish but hey, you'll get it) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETfRihB01LI&t=0s
Well done, We get lots of rain here in southeast Alaska. This will come in handy. Thank you for sharing.
You ARE a genius :)!  Thanks, so great.
Interesting,entertaining  all love,A
TRE a hammock with a tarp over. You may like
Informative and funny. Love your work! Got a tarp delivery next week, can't wait to try out your ideas. Thanks!
you're awesome, thank you so much !!
String rope thingy for a bungee cord, this video is so great! I mean that with all the respect in the world too :)
lol! I was just looking for tent ideas and stumbled onto you. How refreshing, entertaining, and informative! Oh, and here in the US, we call those flexible string thingies "bungee cords" Thank you!
Super nice video, greeting from Germany Peter and dog - HEINZ :)
Excellent & informative clip.
Hello. Did that monster bite you or you had Gardex or smth else for protection?)
How are you so good!!!
Actually there are some more setups.
Tere! Kust selliseid telkmantleid võimalik osta on?
cute
really enjoyed watching this. I like your sense of humour.  The stretchy rope thingies are called bungee cords :)
Hi everyone I hope u don't mind me commenting, can u please check out my friends new channel he would love the support thank u 😊 https://youtu.be/kdjnSWZdUVE great video by the way ☺
Å jaa! Must try these - simple and clever - I love these kind of things - Kiitos!
The stretchy rope is called a "bungee" here in the states. I keep several around to secure stuff. I would not use one for anything that was critical, but they are really useful to minimize "tarp flap." Good job!
OMG you're so cute. *-*
One of my favourite tarp videos, keep up the good work. :)
You are a dork lol
Hell with the tent!! Lets find a 5 star hotel and make love all night.
Good ideas, thanks!
Wtf you got a problem  with Muslims  friend?.
Great information video well made , nice one
In the half open setup, for extra room, you should put a rock on the inside of the tarp and put a rope around it from the outside. This way you can pull the tarp away and create more room without having to use the walking stick.
Love the spider xD
Hey! Where did you get that tarp? Any good shop in Estonia? I tend to find them overpriced, and normally order from Varusteleka in Helsinki.
0:06-0:13 Because Estonia! :D
plenty of trees around you, couldve just used those to make an easy A frame tarp setup
The more you know.  I should be trying this.
Nicely done. Thumb's up video!~John
What about a rope linking two trees, four pegs maximum or small branches, no hiking stick needed...?
Why didn't you do any close up of the drawing and that ass
I could barely pay attention at all. I'm sorry but your legs and ass are far too distracting. I'm a pig, but I had to say it.
Thank you, good video, enjoyed the thoughtful input. Disregard the stupid comments.
Great video!!!
lol
very nicely done!!
3:13 "O man, this was soheasy!" :D  ;=) Nice.
The rubbery thing is a bungie cord
She can go camping with me any time she wants,,, now the question is can she skin an elk? :)
that's wife material if I ever did see it😍
That rubbery string thing with hooks is called an "octopus" :)
the nature looks like sweden :D
New viewer and subscriber. Professional video.  Really liked these tarp set ups. Well done, Not sure if you mean to be quirky, but, it's part of the appeal :-)
your adorable! And now I must sub.
Have you tried sleeping outside in these setups? I'm curious on how good the last one is at shutting out rain, especially if the rain shifts directions during the night.
what kind of dog is that? my dog looks just ike that and we dont know what breed sh is
Nice! Great job.
After just 3 seconds of watching the video I had already thumbs upped and subscribed. I'm in love :-)
that spider thoe 😂😂😂😂
cool
That looks better then a tarp. The ones I have are all mesh like, this actually looks water proof. Looks more like the material my poncho is made of
Its called a bungie cord!
if you have no floor you always trench your tent to keep dry the rain goes into the trench you dig it's like a water canal works great.
Very ingenious tarp origami and well explained with the drawings, I loved it. My only concerns is, here in Québec, Canada we have the most voracious mosquitoes and in crazy amounts. So for me, sleeping in an open tent would equal to suicide!
Hmm.  Transformers, camping edition!
the woods are beautiful...you would be plethora of out doors knowledge to go hiking with, you have drive and passion for the out doors...I like that...keep it up.
I'd hop in a tarp with you any day ;P top notch video though!
Tarp origami - great video!
you're a magician!
sexy :)
Good editing,  the part with the bug was cute. nice vid.
Oh man, this was so heasy
Good Stuff, you have a nice way about you, keep up the good work ;-)
Great designs, thanks for sharing! I'm a bit worried about having the trekking pole so close to my legs though. I would probably kick it in my sleep and make the shelter collapse. Do you ever have this kind of problem?
looks druppy....ergo how the water to drain off..
It's very nice that you made drawings and then the real setup - So it is very informative and clear. Thanks for sharing your approach.
Great you called it a rubbery thing! That way, since english is only a convenience language, most of us know what you are talking about as well as knowing our own languages word for it.  This is written in regard to all the worlds viewers whose daily language and doings are not related to english or its sphere of influence, but share common pursuits. That might well be most
lovely lovely lovely
A great video, but the reason tents are so popular, is that they eliminate Creepy Crawlies, whereas a tarp on bare ground doesn't, as seen on her shoulder @ 4:12...
Great setups, my type of woman, outdoorsy, and beautiful to boot, keep up the great video's.
where I'm at, you probably want to be off the ground, if you have a choice!
great video!
She is gorgeous.
I don't camp out.  I just liked watching you.
excellent video😁 great advice keep up the good work👍
:-)      Thank you.
we call that rubbery thing bungee cord in USA
You're ridiculously cute x
Thanks for the ideas.
Very nice you to experiment different shapes for us. Very interesting and well documented designs. Many thanks from the Great State of Texas...
It's very important to keep your hind quarters dry.
omg your accent sounds nice to my ears!
good woman yourself, great video
"Im a genius!"   ...... Suscribed XD You are great and funny, and a genius of course
You should check out hammock camping. For this year I picked up a warbonnett xlc system and will never go back to ground camping
You replied to me,  "that's because most people from the US are idiots?"  THAT was not very nice and NOT the way to make friends and influence people.   Adios my friend.
Don't know if anyone said this yet or but the "rubbery stretchy" thing is called a bungee cord, at least here in the States. A good old fashion A-frame is good for all around rain protection and air flow, but probably not as much fun to set up. Very fun video!
Great tarp set ups.
Anybody who is willing to sleep outdoors using a tarp is okay in my book!
great idea ! thanks :)
The 'rubbery things' are bungie cords ☺
,nice practical lady,sexy too!
Yes, I would camp with you anytime, especially if you speak German 😀
Very cool lady
I would camp with you any day ;)
Good Video.  You speak English better than most people from the US.
OMG your amazing, helpful, knowledgeable, resourceful, natural, and beautiful. The people close to you are lucky.
I found the tent building instructions very informative. AND... You use a tripod for your camera, you edit out long boring pieces of video, you talk to the camera like it's a person, and you use background music! Great job. You're already in the top 5 percent of Youtube producers.
I can't follow her speedy set up.
Total cutie. I have just pitched a tent! (See what I did there..?!)
Love your enthusiasm, nice video, my thanks.
This woman has been Pixilated! https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pixilated
the stretchy cord is called a bungee cord 😊
Thanks! Exactly what I needed. I hope this will be useful for my summer eurotrip. Last year I had cheap tent from Maxima supermarket and it wasn't best experience. :| Looks like tarp is better solution.
Great video! Just stumbled across your channel and really enjoyed your presentation and style, especially the sketchng. Going to try #3 this evening as rain is on the way and like the view. Is that a 3x3 metre tarp?
What happened to Luna?
Funny girl... "just attach with this rubbery stringy thingy...."  (That would be a bungee cord 😁)
Awesome video! Your sketchbook diagrams are a brilliant addition.
Watching for the 5th time to study once again, having now bought some tarps, how to work them into it. Thanks.
I liked it! We have a plastic tarp we'll have to try out. Pretty scenery in your video - where did you film?
come to canada back packing!
trust me to buy a bloody 3m x 2m tarp
thumbs up, smart and pretty
Eeeeeeek A SPIDER!!!
great editing
Great job, the last one very original, I`ll try it...    Good video...
Thank you so much for all your videos! When I have a bad Working-Day.....I watch one of your vids and it puts a smile on my face, because of your happiness and your wonderful smiling and of course Luna.  Go on that way, thank you,  give Lunar a Kiss and a hug from me.....and a sausage :)  Keep on smiling, greets from far away Germany,  Henning
Check out Louisianahiker channel on poncho, hammock, poncho liner. I liked you video, very creative and funny at times. I think you did a great job making something basic interesting. I have used a tarp for decades. I like to see the outdoors when I camp. I can work or relax under a tarp. I can also make it into a bedroll, or configure it to block out weather. I have hammock camped off and on for 20 years. Depending on the season or weather I bring a military style poncho or 8.5 X 8.5 foot tarp or 3 meter square. I'm glad to see more women enjoying the outdoors. You can make a DIY hammock from any 3 yards of material. Put a prussic knot near each end. Then decide how you want to attach it to the trees. I use a reflective car sun shield as a mat in the hammock. Duct tape some paracord to one end of the sun shield and tie it to the head of the hammock so it does not slide down. It's good to about  40F degrees.
Six packs are good for hiking.
I love your videos. It does help that your stunning though😊. Did you know that the flexible string is called a bungee? x
Damn..This woman turns me on. What a honey.
Very awsome video also the rubbery thing is called a Bungy cord
This was my first time watching one of your videos thanks for sharing the tarp knowledge. Great video and I even like your accent. I have no idea where Estonia is but it looks like a nice wooded area there also.
Lol. You are great
Your accent makes me melt  :) Nice video, thank you for sharing. Regards from Netherlands.
The music is fantastic.  I love this video and your accent
That "kind of flexible string rope thingy" is a bungie/shock cord, lol :P  Great video though, it's funny and I like the music when you're putting the shelters together. I subbed! :D
kewl from Canada
👍 👍🏻 👍🏽
Very fast for estonians)))
I am getting a tarp...inexpensive...crafty
Very well done! Thank you!
What's the point of the tarp being lightweight if you also have to carry a piano?
nice setups
I played 4.38 over and over again. it looked good. sorry.
What type of tarp are you using? Is it a British basha tarp?
You are so cute. Thanks.
Sweet video! Check out Tiny House video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGcG4fStbKw
I would like to marry you !
śliczna Pani :*
Smart & pretty!
fairplay to you.very nice video.
a women doing a ( quite cool ) video and half of the comments are sexist ... what´s wrong with you people ....
I loved this video, it's fun and instructive, thanks for posting it.
yumm yumm yumm
Hi, I'm from Brazil. You're single. You want to marry me. I'm single. I liked you. Get in touch with me. Thank you.
never imagined you could use a tarp in so many ways thanks for that
Flexible stringy thing may just be a bungee cord hmm lol
Wouldn't you just love to share a tarp with this lady :-)
wow you are sexy
Nice video.thank you
Can't do that in Australia.  You would get eaten
1:09 this thingy its just called bunji cord :-)
Great inspiration, as always :) In your first video you used a hammock. Why did you switch? Was it because of the windchill from below? Or some other reason? I'm asking because I'm totally new at hiking and I'm waiting for a camping hammock I ordered (with mosquito net, yay!). I found your channel when looking for tips and tricks and I've realized I probably should get a reflecting pad (or the budget option - a windshield-screen for cars) to have some sort of warmth even in warm summer nights in my hammock.  Also, the orange tarp you got - was it bad? You didn't seem too impressed with it in your review, but I couldn't tell if that was because of distractions or if the tarp wasn't good?
Excellent video.
How are the hiking possibilities in estonia? Ok so i just went and googled it. You guys have pretty great number of national parks. So seems good.   Greetings from Finland
try to find you some Tyvac
Hi, great video, loved the horror film spider, made me laugh! Well done.
I'd rather stay off the ground under heavy rain. Hammoc + Tarp cover. Here you have to hope the ground will suck up all the water before it gets the chance to run under your tarp edges ... I guess it depends where you camp
Ground cover is most important. Take a look at how to make a bivvie with the tarp.  It's like a sleeping bag
One trick you could do on the "half open with a floor" version is take a rock and put it in the middle of the back wall and then tie a ripe around it (with the rock making a lump in the tarp like you did with your pole) and then pull the back wall taunt to a spike.  Great video!
Nice, thanks for your video from Spain, I subscribe and, of course... is like. Don´t stop uploading more videos. Ty
What about mosquitoes later in the season? They would eat me alive using tarp
nice video and beautifull place in the forest.
Cute as a bug! Nice tarp setups too!
Have you stayed out overnight in any of those shelters? By the way, in the U.S. we call those "stretchy strings" bungee cords.
Great fun vid. Subscribed! Instead of bungie for tarp "top knot" on walking pole, use "constrictor knot" with 30cm of paracord. P.S. If you have trouble with "Wind", I believe there are pills available for that.... xXx
camo tarp and hi vis guy lines??????
not to bad
Ale zajebisty las :)
very cool, would go hiking with you anytime.
Just found your channel - great vid! Your English is excellent so please don't take this as criticism just for your future knowledge... in the UK we call the 'rubbery thing' a 'bungee cord'. Like when people bungee jump off a bridge!
you're beautiful and I like your videos
Love you...
Hello your dog looks like mine, super video. Greetings from germany
good english
super!!!
Great video!  Appreciated the inset diagrams.   Keep up the good work.
I just discovered your channel and subbed. Great tarp set ups. Thank you for sharing.
Клёвая тёлка. Мечта туриста.
Love the jazzy piano music
Thanks for your video.  Please check out my original, homemade songs, He Wasn't Just A Dog, Go'n Downtown and Evergreen (We Remain).  Thanks for listening and thanks for your video.  If you like these songs, please ask a friend to take a listen.  Thank you.
cool location. great sunlight in some of those scenes.
Love how quick those set up. Luna's a badass.
Does this protect against bears?
You're so cute :-)
hi
Ikea urządzasz i masz😛
żeby roboczek nie wszedł do dziurki😀
Good info, thanks for posting!
if i may suggest... instead of using single post as center stand... tie a pair of pole instead and make it stand as inverted "V'. that would then give you more flexible unhindered legroom to move on the tent center. just my 2 cents.,,,, cheers!! ;-)
U are so much fun hehe
Thank you for the sharing these tips. I'm a Game design student and was looking to get insight/and ideas for some kind of mock up survival game. Keep on exploring.
My great grandfather came from Estonia.  You look like you might be a relative. ;)  Nice tarp tent ideas btw.
You are nice looking
I like the last one as well.  It can also function as a heat reflector.
how about snakes,,, can easily pass thru sides ??
Thank you for sharing your video.  It was easy to follow all your instructions. I love what you call the "stringy ropey things" We all can see what they are buy the way you describe them was genuine and beautiful.  Thank you!!!!
You are an refreshing creature, nice video, i have to keep an eye on you well done
Square tarps for life! Nothing is as versatile or effective as a 3x3. I go with a full silicone tarp myself (my old Nordisk is still going strong after years and years of abuse).  I never had to use my tarp in tree-less terrain. In that case I usually just use my waterproof bivvy bag, so I stick to tree setups. You can go fully or partially closed on those, too. But the reason I like tarps is that you can sleep out in the rain, but still see the stars when they poke through again later. I have seen gale force winds in them (not fun, but it worked), nights of driving rain and full bore thunder storms (those were fun!). Even then, nothing beats a good tarp setup.  Awesome enthusiasm! Keep up the good work and keep having fun out there!
"String rope thingy" is called a bungee cord in the U.S. I like your #2 set up as it fully protects you from the rain no matter what angle it comes from. Never cared for sleeping under a tarp. Bought and got to using/liking the Lavvu setup. Thanks for the video as I'm always interested in how women think when doing things outdoors.
You have an amazing ass..oops
Good ideas. Thanks.
I use a Hennessy Hammock, but I'm looking for alternatives (when there are no trees).  These are good ideas, but what about the MOSQUITOES?!
whats the fucking name of that song at 1:23 ? haha :D
Loved the video, very interesting and I like your enthusiasm thanks
LOVE YOUR SELTER NUMBER 2 BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CANAL OYT SIDE SO THE RAIN WILL NOT ENTER YOUR TENT
really nice
Some good ideas. :-)
Hello, is very useful. What do think about Plashch palatka Плащ палатка ???
adorable =)
Nice Tarp Idea's :-) Hello from Scotland :-)
awesome imagination, thanks!
aren't you afraid of Spiders??
Just great vid 📹 👍. Tks for sharing.
Plenty of room for a MAN also.
Your rubbery thing is  a bungee cord :-)
with that many tree clos by, I will go with a classic A frame 😊
lol I should send you my own 2 person tunnel tent, I never use it anymore since I prefer tarps. At some point in life I decided to make things more simple and stop carrying so much high tech gear, and I am very happy with that choice.
Just a thought but if you swop a photography monopod for one of the hiking poles you'll be able to get more height inside as the monopod is longer when extended. Regards Wayne
Great Vid and 3 functional Tarp Setups. Greetings from Germany
Hey great vid
Thanks for the great ideas.
It's call a bunji cord'
Really practical, easy to build and very well explained...Regards...
How much does all this gear weight?
to Kute 4 words.   kutos on your englush just a hint of accent but well done!!  oh and strechy thingie = bungy cord
For your #3 design, you pretty much took care of leaning the back wall away from the interior space with your trekking pole, but just a thought I had, was that you could use a pebble or coin as a grommet, so that you'd be able to tie a line to that empty space of the tarp to pull the wall out of that interior space that way... so it wouldn't have to be propped up, etc. I found a YouTube video to show what pebble ties and coin grommets are just in case this is unfamiliar terminology (you might know it by a different name): "Pebble ties & coin grommets. Easily add pegging points to canvas tarps, tents, windbreaks" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26XTAlrqVFs. Thanks for the video.
so... that's great and all, but what about when it actually rains?  All the water will just run under the tarp and soak you and anything you might possibly be sleeping on or have brought with you...
You are so awesome :-)
That was soooo good and fun to watch. thanks for sharing. Yes I subscribed.
Love your videos and wish to see more soon,
The camp set up you have is awesome. being myself from northern Canada , you do instill great camping and bushcraft skill. thank you.
I got a tarp to put over my hammock as a rain fly but always wondered what else it might be good for. Thank you for creating and sharing this video. Happy trails!
what is the name of the tarp and where did you get it?  Thanks
You might want to take a look at this video for tarp set ups  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxtHJm51NPY&t=1007s or this one     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8lw64__n8M
Nice video and informative subbed you looking forward to seeing more atb from Scotland.
love you x

Nice Job 2nd one was my favorite. First one looked like a strong wind would blow it down.
Great video keep them coming
great video!
Im curious, are insects ever a problem?
decathlon sell one man lightweight tents for around  €24
You are adorable. Thanks for posting the video!
Love your enthusiasm!
Cute video! You're a lot of fun! Good music mix and presentation!
rubbery stringy rope thingy = bungy cord :-)
Great job with all the tarp shelter set-ups. I used the third (last) one you demonstrated and for my use, it was the best.  Rigged out my 3x3 meter tarp with all the guidelines, so it's a fast set up.  Thanks.
These are great!  Thank you, loved the presentation. I'll have to try these.  I used a tarp shelter for cooking when I backpacked Scotland in 2015.  Here's a blog post about the tarp configuration I used, scroll down to see it with my dog. By the way, I would recommend the Saguaro backpackers' tent by Texsport. Lightweight, inexpensive, and has served me well. Cheers!  http://featherlady.blogspot.com/2015/05/shelters-or-home-is-where-you-happen-to.html
How do you deal with mosquitos ?
i 💓 the presentation.
love
Thx :-)  Loved the whole attitude and the tips.
really great review easy to follow thank you
You can never have enough flexible string rope thingies on hand. =) Liked the vid, thanks for sharing
Try hammocks! :)
wow, nice work.  thanks 4 the diagrams, that helps.  i like your jacket, what brand is that??  :)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWPovzXGg6c
thank you for your video some interesting set ups
Респект девчуле!
Rubbery thing is bungee cord dear. Very good videos. Love the dog.
Very nice! Greetings
Nice ideas, like it.And does ANYONE knows what camo this is?. Never seen it before, but it would perfectly match the most woodland undergrounds where i live, much better than our 'official' camo.
Thanks I'll  be under a tarp hiding for a SAR exercise Sunday
@4:50 worlds fastest child birth
Hi! A very nice video! I like the last one :-) Thumbs up! Atb from Austria, Martin
cool video...I like those inset diagrams.
That rubberie thing is a bungie cord and it is made from the same material as shot cord.
If you woke up with lube a around your rectum when you woke up while camping would you tell anyone?  If not, let's go camping.  Hell even if you would let's still go camping.
Hi there. Great stuff!!   Your "stretchy cord" is called a "bungee (bun-jee) cord".  At least that's what they're called in here in North America.
In the original pyramid gonfiguration, instead of a pole, use a stone, a larkshead know, and rope to throw over a branch fo get the height correct
very creative
Great video, very clear and well explained,  I love your energy x
6.30s hands on yur kneeees!  phoaar
your fukin sexy as fuk!!!!! :-) xxx
Great video. I love how you show a diagram of the tarp set up with each configuration. Well done..
lol thats funny
Just found and subbed your channel. ATB from Scotland.
Thank you for posting this! I'm definitely going to try set up number three next time I'm camping. I've used method one and didn't like much. Usually I just set up "A" frame or lean-to.
What do you do when the rain gets under your tarp??
your cute, very nice looking to
nice vid, keep it up
OMG Becky look at her tarp I love big tarps and I can't lie
That forest is beautiful!  Great setups!
Great video Hiker in Estonia. Luna sure looks like she enjoys it too!
Enjoyed
Young lady, you just made my day. High fives to you. Keep up the fun stuff and enjoy . Thanks for sharing.
Love this so much! Extremely well done :)
You are the sweetest! Watching this video definitely made me smile x
Where did you get your tarp? Do you have a link so that I can get one.  Good video
Лайк не глядя красивой женщине!
Stretchy rope thingy = Bungee Cord
a ground cloth is essential
lol nice.
I really liked how you drew the shelter while also setting it up at the same time.
Hiker in Estonia, You have the bottom of a lady teddy bear ;)
Just subed.  We started a new channel, so are using a new account, and we've found all these great new camper/bushcrafters!  It is like YouTube had us in a box, and wouldn't show us anything else.  I'm utterly astounded at the amount of quality people making videos now.  What is that white font that you were using, or was that hand drawn, if a font, we intend to steal it from you, it is really nice, lol!  Thanks for this vid.  We're tent campers, but are making the transition to tarp.
great sense of humor
I have the 3mx3m tarp also by DD Hammocks. I have also made a video of different style also. I like your last set-up. Il will have to try that next time i'm out. Thanks for some new ideas. Gordon
tarp is the best way to go!!...especially if one needs and wants to avoid people!!! ;-)  thanks for the video...
What kind of tarp is that? Where do you get the designs for your tents?
wow your a amazing women. im full inpressed with your innovative ideas.I'v been using tarps for a Cople years have you tryed use a slightly bigger trap & make a teepee I use 5  7 ft sticks, tie them together on the ground helps with a strong shelter.  looking forward to more videos
Hi, you are a lot of fun to watch. Thanks
I really need a tarp. Thanks!
the rubbry thing is called a bungy
White David she said she couldn't afford a tent that's why she used a tarp
great setups think i will give that ago myself cheers
Love the set up ideas! just for an extra ounce or two a ground sheet such as Tyvek or polycro will give you waterproof floor. Great video
That's really a great bit of kit. Thanks for sharing your ideas!
Very good, especially the second one - thank you
I like the flexible string rope thingy (Bungee cord).. That was adorable!!!
Very good video!  I like the setups and I like the fact that you are using a normal tarp: not an 80 dollar one.  In the last setup: with the floor and open front, you could have a small fire in front and stay very warm due to the reflected heat.
thank you for another video!  Do you ever bring a floor with you? Oh, I see you answered below!
But .... who carries hiking sticks?
that's actually a neat simple setup
oh outdoor outlaw 7
hey check out my shelter set ups these are just a few that i have made with one tarp i have approximately 18 set ups that i will share over the next coming year 2017 as im going to europe for one year to do some more videos so look out for them
Cutie...
I love your accent.
To get better airflow in a fully enclosed setup, attach the tarp to the pegs a bit higher up and you get some inflow from the ground. Unfortunately - that also means more forest spiders (we have the same ones here in Sweden too).
Good shelters, but remember you would on the 1st two be sitting on the wet ground. If you get one of the very inexpensive 2m x 2m plastic tarps, you would have something to sit / sleep on .  2m x 2m folded on half is then thicker and a bit more cold resistant. You could even stuff it with grass or thin branches for comfort and heat retention.
please can you mention the specs and price in description ?
#3 would be useful as a windbreak and with a warming fire.
It's called a bungee sweetie
Great video! :) Just an idea for the rubber-thing around the pole: I have cut an old bike-tube into little rings. One put around the pole on top would do the job too I guess. Very much lighter tho and easier to transport. I carry 5 or 6 of those around the sheath of my knife.
Terrific. When I was a Boy Scout, our troop only used tarps for tents. They are better than many tents. Just add a waterproof ground sheet, and Otto's your uncle, warm and dry.
budgie cords
This was great, thx, thumbs up
aww super adorable how you said packpack
the stretchy rope-- in the US we call them bungee cords.
great video :) the host was awesome and so too was the security dog :)
I like your tarp setups. But I'm a wuss about bugs and mosquitoes all over me. Got to have a bug net. Still, fun watching you. Thanks!
You're great!
Vera usefull your Videos ....
really fun and informative...dry in southern california....who needs a tent anyway!!!!!
Thanks so much got all my hiking  gear ready to go 😉
THE Tarp 3*3??
you finnaly got your channel back 👍
I'm not going to lie I started watching this cause you are very cute but you done an awesome job on this video  I learnt some cool stuff today thanks to you much appreciated
Does your tarp really have that many holes per side? Like your drawing? Mine have only 1 or two holes per side
Like Origami for tarps!
The "rubbery thing"- Bungee cord! Great stuff always have several metres on my pack.
your dog is awesome......always 'eyes on' at the start
you might like Emilie Learning Bushcraft, in Sweden.
Great video.....thanks for the ideas
The second shelter; the pyramid design is the best for shelter from high wind and rain.
Hah! Telling someone to "go take a hike" means "go the hell away" in the U.S. Here, if we're suggesting hiking to someone else, "go *for* a hike" is way more friendlier. 🌲
Clever use of the notebook :-) Greetings from Norway, and thumb up.
Very sexy♋️🍒
first time in your channel. Your excitement, your positive attitude and your cuteness are contagious. Thank you :)
man your cute !
Tarps are ok but they really suck when the winds pick up because the noise of the wind hitting the tarp will drive you insane, then you will go nuts and rip your tarp down and just sleep out side for about 30 min, then its going to start to rain and then your going to wrap yourself into a human burrito, trust me this suck :)
=^.^=
Excellent explantions, best how-to tarp video I found so far.
all kidding aside,, you're cute !!
Useful demonstrations thanks!
Rubbery thing = bungee cord!  :)  Nice vid, just got back from camping this weekend in Georgia!
Nice video. I will show some of the tarp designs to my scout troop. Always looking for something simple to pass on, and get the kids outdoors.
Dear boys: How about we try complimenting her on her video making, her bushcraft skills and less so her looks. C'mon.
a very beautiful outdoors woman the best kind there is
Nice video. With all of those trees, you could tie one corner to a tree about 2 meters high and only use three pegs for the other corners.  I usually sleep in a hammock with a diamond shaped tarp., so I use two trees for a ridge line then use two pegs to hold the sides down.
Brilliant video, Hiker!
Say Heah,  Lemme be the first to Wish You a Merry Christmas,   https://youtu.be/OJRTqWybfok  Paul'ie. ,, .
cool vid,hi from the deserts of Arizona
I really enjoyed this video you have a new subscriber
sexy lady
What type of tarp are you using? Is it army surplus?
true love ya
I like the third setup.  Never thought of that layout. You are very fun to watch I am looking forward to what comes next. Include your dog more please and purple is a great color on you
cool. great vid. I like the location. open tarp design 3 is my favourite.
Bonjour !tres bonne video et beau chien !.Cordialement M.
I was like she is beautiful. Then I saw she is estonian and I was like of course she is beautiful. Her genetics are western finno-ugric mixed with northern germanic. The same reason I am so damn handsome.Greetings from Finland.
beautiful luna. great vid
I have camped up north canada and there are many things that are important......a good sleeping bag is a must and knowledge how to make fire in rain , snow , is paramount importance...........be safe
Please!... go invest in a decent one person tent.  Many don't weigh anymore thanyour setup and will really keep you dry because they have a sealed floor. Also theyhave a screen to keep bugs and rodents out.  I promise they will make your outdoorexperience much better.
What's going on with the camera?! All the jumping around and cut marks!! Fuck! Can't you formulate a thought longer than like 10 seconds!?!?!
Great! Greetings from Brazil.
How tall are you? Just trying to figure out what size tarp a taller man would need.
you are so cutre~ what kind of tarp is that? and the size? thanks for the vid~
great setups! do they hold up well when theres wind?
excellent video, i've tried all your tarp shapes/designs and they all work up here in the north of scotland
Great video, good work. Hope you have a wonderful winter season from all of us at North Wind Guides. (We are giving out a FREE bushcraft KNIFE on a contest on our channel right now)
The rubber thingy is a bungee cord. I enjoyed the vid.
Cool!! I like ur music choice too!
the rubbery strappy thing is called an occy strap. i think it comes from octopus because they hook onto stuff and don't come off  ;)  i like the music too
I think I'm in love lol
Great Vid !
Over here we call that elastic thingy a bungee cord, or strap. I love your tents, however, fully enclosed tents are made to keep bugs and snakes out. That can come in handy. But you are doing great. Carry on.
Moyà princessa. Very well done for a Eastern Europe girl. You should come and teach our American girls.
Sweet video. Good fun and info. Cheers
Please excuse my naïveté, but are all tarps the same size (like 8' × 8')?  Does Estonia have various elevations to camp in?  I'm in Denver, Colorado (U.S.A.) where it's a mile high above sea level. Our largest peaks are only a bit over 14,000-ft.  You're a wonderful & pretty lady & I enjoyed my first VID of yours tremendously!
I like your resourcefulness
Lol bungee cords
greeting from indonesia. i like your videos and enjoying it very much. it gives me knowledge. your vid inspires me to take a hiking journey with my wife. keep up the good work & be safe!
Nice!  Might have to get two trekking poles now.  Never saw a use for them before.  Fortunately I have plenty of stretchy / spider things on hand, and tarps. :)  Fun, informative video, thanks!
Great video!
I like it if one make something for more than one function.  A poncho is a pretty awesome piece of kit you can wear when you're hiking in the rain, but it's too small to use as a tent also.  So how about if you make two poncho's as one piece, you wear them on top of each other (so what ?) and when you want to camp you separate them and fold open to have double the size.  You can extend the rear of the poncho's length to cover your rucksack without being too short at the back and gain a bit larger tent that way.  When done sleeping you fold the one over the other and you can wear it or carry it.  A poncho is just a piece of rectangular tarp with a hood fitted.  A double tarp will be a longer rectangular with two hoods.  Lol, just make sure the hoods face the same way when folded.  Want to give it a go ?
4:35! :D damn you! I must to try!
Pretty eyes !  And that "stretchy rubbery thing" is bungee cord. Camo with red ropes... ? But well done on the configurations. You will want a waterproof ground if it is going to rain.
nice
The last setup looks quite nice. If you would tighten up tarp a bit would be perfect. Happy hiking :)
hello from Paris  it is à very good idea to use tarp than à tent I will use thé next time it's easy to carry may be I will use two tarp
you are very beautiful !
backdraw with open front tents is when it's Rain and the wind is turning from direction ;)
I feel happier from listening to you 🙂
As regards what we British commonly refer to as a bungee cord, does it really matter what it is called when the young lady explained very clearly its nature & use, things are often called different things in various countries? To remove any shadow of a doubt, she clearly showed the cord and displayed the nature of its functionality. This is the first video I have seen by hikerinestonia or whatever her tag is? I do NOT generally sweat the small stuff but I enjoyed your presentation. I am in awe of your linguistic abilities, for which I congratulate you, as you put me & I suspect many English native speakers to shame as we tend to be less able or inclined to be fluent in regional dialects & other languages, speaking personally I even failed compulsory French at school. Although to be fair I am learning Dutch currently for personal reasons.  Thanks once again M'dear I have subscribed to your thread and will watch your future videos with interest as I have long been a prepper and as an ex boy & scout, I like to be prepared. ;)
Clever...young lady.
Awesome vid, well done! BTW thank you for assuming the other folks would prefer not to have dog they don't know come bounding towards them! :)
What ist this for a shelter? Can you give me the shop/link where i can this Tarp order? Thanks
The rubber (thingy) is called a bungee-sweetie😘
You're adorable. :)
enjoyed the video, will try to make these on the weekend, Thanks from Canada
In Australia we call the "rubbery thing" an "oky strap".  Nice vid.  Thanks.
Along with your tarp carry a , painters drop cloth , weight 6 ounces, 8' x8' , put down on floor,  then you are truly ,,good to go,  I carry 4 or 5 of them in my pack always,,, Saved my butt many times,  I live in Alaska, $3.00  plastic drop sheets have made me sleep very well,,, many times..
Your cute as a button and Love your dog.  Looks like my mischief maker.  Thank you for the video.
thanks I'll try them out.
looks very cold at the night
I've never seen some of those tent setups - I'm going to give some of these a try ;>) Thanks for sharing these ;>)
What a great combination of beautiful lady, intelligence, and innovative girl!!  Thanks for this video, and, since I have tarps, I never imagined them to be used so creatively!
You mean there's an actual, real place called 'Estonia?' All these years, I thought it was some type of 'map-marker' or something of that nature!Also...could you please establish if the Capitol of 'Itty-bitty' is called 'Istsy-bitsy?'  I've tried 'Wiki', but no help from them!(they are 'snooty', I believe)I have read that the 'Mongeese season' is in full-sway there in Eastern Europe...could you verify this, please?Thank Youps...das ist ein schoen fraulein!
your very beautiful
Excellent vid lady !best wishes
never used a tarp cause i don't know how too. This looked great so will be online shopping for tarps tonight ... .thankyou from Scotland
This has some great ideas for how to set up a tarp.  Thank you.
Great video, nice setups!
Oh God, why have I never been to Estonia?
Good and entertaining video. Subbed you.  Keep up the good work!
No ground cover.  Not me.  When the whole ground is soaking. Ground from the inside will get wet.
Lay on the ground with a mosquito net over you. Instead of 1 poncho use 2
Nice Demo! Love the enthusiastic presentation.  This guy has a cleaver tent, 12ftx12ft, full floor, headroom, one pole, door that closes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRBtof2pAqI  Another comfortable tent, better for two people, 10ftx20ft tarp, full floor with partial tub sides, one pole, waterproof door http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX8o_zoWzJE
The 'rubbery thing' is called a bungee cord :)
really nice presentation.. specially the scetch snap.. totally informative. i am a hammock camper. but when i there is no trees to hang my tarp, i have to make one of these configurations. each has its own cons and pros. i prefer the first one as i can adjust the size of the entrance. gives sufficient room even for 2 persons with backpacks. however it requires many sticks.  the pyramid is an optimum solution with less sticks and easy to build. i just donot feel comfortable with the entrance and it cause alot of condensation. the third one looks nice and cool. i will try it definitely next hike.
Nice video...and its called Bungee cord...great for quick tarp setup,  especially in the dark...can set it up next to saplings or small trees  to tie off to them...or use 550 cord/paracord to tie off...anchor  corners and edges of tarp down with small stones if available...may want to carry couple of large rubber bands to wrap top of tarp around trekking pole...
Tere! Thank you for sharing your experience!   I think only tarps is better than a cheap tent, and I guess many tents are only good for 4-5 years.  (I always need to put a tarp/or lightweight plastic over the roof of my tent, and one for the floor). I have found a very light tent "Gelert track1 tent", with the idea to bind it on the front of a kayak.  Thinking about it, tarp only could also work!
awesome! please check out my channel. cheers
I like #2 but a part of me assumes if you tuck the entrance into the tent it would allow water to follow the crease inside.
good job but really needs a floor
0:56 the looks of that dog :)
Thanks for posting these video's.  Great job.
Aaaaaand here come the pervs haha
Great videos...
You're cute:)
Oh my gosh you are so cute! And very creative!
are you Estonian?
Always a good idea to bring a tarp and string. But you can buy a little 1 man full coverage tent also, Light weight...But great job!!!
Good ideas for a set up....thanks
There's not enough women like this in the US!
Nice tarp set ups. I think we were meant to go hiking together.
That was a great video! Always looking for something different to do on my overnight hikes with my son and dog. I can see depending on the conditions using all 3. Subscribed.
what is the SIZE of the tarp???   Thanks.
Nice, you make tarping look like a lota fun :D
Nice Video. Thank you for showing these setups.
Really nice video! When I saw Estonia in the title I had to watch. I have great respect for your country and people. One of my favorite books is Woodworking in Estonia, by A. Viires. A great resource about traditional woodworking. I have subscribed and shall explore your channel. :)
Great! the diagrams are simple. I am just getting now getting educated with shelters. Is the paracord/ rope cut in multiple lengths, or is it 1 long strand?
Thanks for making this interesting video. I've been toying with the idea of buying a tarp for the same use. One of my concerns, though, is all the spiders, scorpions and snakes we have in Australia. I'd probably be safer in a tent, but they weigh more.
A tarp it is :) Cool weird looking combinations, worth trying out thrue the night. Thank you for sharing.
Wufh! :-)
from US, No shit one of the top 3, and yes I have seen and lived thru alot am a tarp fan, I go larger, I am old and slow, anybody who shares Luna as a dogs name is truly Genius! good stuff
Your 3rd setup is definitely the best but id suggest bringing some  plastic to line the floor, you can roll the plastic up around a log on  each side to create a barrier so your bed does not flood.   As well with the string to your top flap if you run 2 lines in a Y instead of 1 you can build a fire near your shelter with out burning through the string.
very nice and so helpful ☆☆☆☆☆
Thanks for sharing
Wow! Thanks very much! I'm going to practice these in the backyard.
Ma'am, you are delightful.
stretchy string rope thingy is "bungy cord" or elastic rope. . bungy cord. nice video
Nice video and easy to understand. It's funny as well. Good job.
where can you get a tarp like that and does it have a name>? thanks
nice video :) thx for showing this tipps
Very good video. I love your accent!  lol
I'm with  Mike Cooper your awesome, let us know when we can go camping with you.
Great video and I like your diagrams for each set up.  It makes it easier to follow.
Great work!
in the UK we call the rubbery thing a bungee cord, can have it with or without the hooks
I would backpack with you anytime! Keep up the great work!
cool video,  love the fun you put into it. keep them coming.  NTL BUSHCRAFT
you are very fun and cute. thanks for the video :)
interesting video,  its great to see new ideas from someone with really interesting personality
I like your tarp set ups. Have you tried the "plow point" set up ? perfect for a square tarp. For a video go to Dave Canterbury, good info.
fantastic and entertaining, loopers and all. I believe a couple small pieces of heavy fabric would help preventing the poles from chafing and wearing the tarp thin at the points of contact but I think is smart. thanks
Bonkers, but cute :) Keep up good work x
Nice job! Is that the "blue stone" tarp brand? I have the olive one. Would like the camouflage one too!
😂👏👏👏👍👍👍
Thumbs up! Great video. New subscriber here. Thanks for showing us the various tarp configurations you use. It's always awesome to get nee ideas!
Ideally your tarp would have loops sewn onto the outside so that you could run lines from nearly any angle in order to create different setups. I have a DD 3m x 3m tarp and it's great for this purpose.
I love you!
Sei brava e molto carina😘
wow that pretty cool I use a paracord between two trees but if they too far apart trekking poles look like a great alternative ..,
Loving that tarp
very nice job
"Flexible string-rope thingy"........????
Very nice video! Subscribed! I love your eyes! xD Thanks for sharing and regards from Argentine.
hahahah that spider close up. Nice video, thanks for sharing!
your strech cords are called bungee cords,
I think I love you! #banter
Wow this was really interesting. I want to go try this now LOL. The rubbery thingy, we call it a bungee cord over in the US. I often wonder if it's the same name everywhere. I like "rubbery stretchy thingy" better LOL
Nice video. Hello from Latvia.
Here is my favourite setup, simple and easy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7NdWp0JMVM This one is in Norwegian, most of my videos are in english, but you will understand the setup. The benefit with this is that you dont need a big tarp, even a small one will cover you. try it. :) You have a great presentation appearence, really like what you do :)
Hey, very nice video, thank you for that!!! Your english is sooooo understandable for germans, it was like listening to a german Vid, THX :) :) From which part of the lovely UK are you from?
This Video was verry helpfull, thank you...
I just subscribed to your channel love your positive attitude and thoughts!
You are an intelligent and fun lady. Thanks for a great video!
engenious. good work!
Thanks for you video.  Please check out my original homemade song, He Wasn't Just A Dog.  If you think it has merit, please tell a friend to listen.  Also I have two other nice songs, Go'n Downtown and Evergreen (We Remain).  Thank you for listening and thanks for your video.
I like them.
found you by accident loved the video subscribed and like ...fellow  hiker in vermont usa
Great video and the music was perfect for the task(s) of building the shelters. The rubbery rope is known as a bungee cord. If it gets frayed get rid of it and get a new one. Just some advice so you don't have one snap back and hit/hurt you.
Friendly spider at 4:10 xD that was awesome hehehe
Scheme 3 -- You can have a fire on the open side for warmth. Although you might need to reposition the front guy line.
hi. Great video. Now you just need to add this baby: http://lesovik.eu/sklep/ultralight-2-ch/ And you don't care if ground is wet or dry :)
thank you
Excellent video
great video I have one of these tarps but not got to use it yet love your accent
Ummm well ah... Add Rain and see how ya do LOL
That was helpfull, thank you
Love this video -- going to go out to a state park with my son to try this out this Saturday. Question: are your drawings of these layouts available online? I will probably just pause the video and transcribe them, but if they were available online that would be nifty.  Great channel and you are so charming -- looking forward to more videos!
greatly enjoyed thanks
Honestly - you do a great presentation with your vids! Lovely background, good talking. I really enjoyed it. Big thumbs up.
Great video, and I love the setups! also, it never hurts to put a pretty girl in front of the camera. I call the first set up the "DD TeePee".... Its an odd name, but it stuck with me. Mostly cuz the first time I saw it was with a DD 3x3 metre tarp when I was searching for TeePee ideas....
Check out BushCraftUSA.com  Silnylon tarps. Great prices and extremely durable.Lots of information on configurations as well. They have a lot of hiking oriented Info too.
Really like your style.  I will definitly try all these setups!
great video and information!
the rubber cord thing with the hooks, I have always called them bungys. great video. x
tarps work great as well tho so you go girl
and amazon has great deals on all season tents I picked up a 2 person 4 season tent for under a 100$
bungee cord
Too expensive ? You're not looking hard enough.  http://www.sportsmansguide.com/product/index/guide-gear-bivy-tent?a=1749232  http://www.ebay.com/itm/GoLite-Utopia-2-freestanding-floorless-tent-Ultralight-4-Season-Backcountry-/201715918091?hash=item2ef734a50b:g:zxAAAOSwXeJYJkwd  Now for "the stretchy thing" ... repeat after me ... BUN-GEE CORD. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bungee%20cord  Overall your's is a good video, quick and light hearted. The tarp has an advantage over a tent, because of your dog. Dogs tend to put holes in the floors of tents with their claws, even though they don't intend to. Thanks.
good video! I just subscribed glad I found you! I love tarps no tent! LOL
check my channel for "Survival Tarp wird Zelt mit Boden 5 euro Tutorial" that is a spoken in weird german but i think you will understand, i used this eays 100 times and works perfekt, and with a extra poncho you can even close it compledly when the weather gets realy bad, its perfekt when traveling with a dog or 2 person  all the best and i wish you a awesome time outdoor Stefan
this is a nice idea, but, they sell small tents with floors that go up fast and are self supported. When its raining, you want a dry floor, and fast setup.  Small one man tents are the way to go.
The cord is called Shock Cord/s, nice video...
Wow you are so beautiful. I think I'm in love
not a bloody chance!!!!!😁
Survival Lily?  Wait... who are you??
it's the groovy music I like
Very Nice! To save space, I bought shock cord which is much thinner and less bulky but does the same as the bungie cord.
bungy-cord!! not rubbery thing!
Never knew Estonia had cakes. Subscribed!!!
i'm in 2 minutes and giggling along . you are FUN to watch and listen too , thankyou :)
Sooo good to see a woman doing one of these vids! Great to see the landscape of a Baltic state and another thumbs up for doing it in your second language. Your English is excellent! You're an inspiration!
'Go take a hike yourself'  ?   That means something rude here, haha.
it looks beautiful there.
The rubber stringy  thing is a bungee (or thats what we call them in the UK)
Great Video and pretty cool setups.  My thump Gose up. I take your Abo.  Greatings from Micha :-)
You may want to try this for weather proofing & light weight fabric.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-UTZPllgqSc Also ripstopbytheyard.com
Great video!  Where did you buy your tarp?
I like your sketches!  They make what you are doing much clearer.  thanks!
its wonderful to see your videos with this lovely woman brimful of life!!!
watching this on my work lunch break and I about choked on my bread laughing at the spider part LOL Very funny!
Did you get a chance to test drive any of these overnight or in the rain? I have a cheapie little tent that served me well this summer, but I've played around a bit with the idea of just using a tarp. Thanks for sharing.
GENIAL
This was a very nice presentation.  Thank you.
that is some very beautiful forest behind you. The rubbery thing is a bungee cord.
Great work! ;)
youare very funny!👍
I will defo try the last one, thanks for sharing.
Hi, experiences with snow or very cold winter with the shelter?
Great. Well explained. Many Greetings from Steffen from Thuringia :)
Awesome video. Simple and useful.
BUNGEE CORDS! That's what they call those elastic ropes in the U.S. :)  This is the first time I've watched one of your videos. I enjoyed your smile and fun loving presentation, and I like your dog too :)  Thanks for sharing :)
i guess too many ask to be your camping partner......sigh....
love the music.
04:50 the tent/tarp just *gave birth* to a Hiker.....  lol
Thank for this video and your humour and smile. +1, bye :)
Thanks, good job! And what a nice dog... Look for the setup oft this Isle oft Wright guy, interisting. Linke setup 1 but much better with the pole in the middle and fully enclosed.
The first and last were my favorites.  Thanks for providing the diagrams.
LOVE THE DIAGRAMS
Very good!
Excellent presentation. I'm a hammock camper.  There's a bit of a fiddle factor in the beginning but it gets easier with time. I would knock this trekking poles over in my sleep as I toss and turn.   I really enjoy your videos and hope you continue to make them!
good video; thanks for posting! I'm surprised that I haven't seen your channel before
Well presented layouts, very well presented video. I particularly liked the last one, as you said it gives you a more open feeling, which is why I prefer tarps over tents as you're part of the environment not just in it.
Awesome set ups, really liked the 3rd one. Thank you for sharing : ) Jay
In your 2nd setup, instead of flip the "door" into, bend it over the side out of the door. The same as you can see in 3:16. Get into the tarp and then catch the corner from inside and tie it to a pike beside the tarp. If you bend it into, rain slides into while doing that it's really closed and keeps out the rain.Excuse my bad English, sorry.
Bingo cord
Doesn't the water flow under the tarp and make the ground wet?
its a bungy cord dear.
Have you ever considered hammock camping? :) Much better sleeping off the ground and you have most of the stuff needed anyway. Search for "shugemery+tarp"...happy hanging :)
its nice to see more ladies camping
i like it next do it in slow motion but great video  i like youtube videos but not yanktube and i hate it when people play horrible music
thank you very much for sharing with. us do we get to see a camp fire and some great cooking some time.you look like a great cook. love from nova scotia Canada.
Very nice tarp ideas. Thank you. I loved this video
I dont get one thing. How can one be protected if its raining ? I mean....the water does flow through the terrain and end up inside...probably not at the last one depending on where the water it travelling but still....how ?
good video ☺
Great vid and set ups!  Plus, hilarious!!  I know my Sheltie Owen would knock my hiking pole over in the middle of the night ~ but I'm going to try it anyhow!  Thanks!
I d love when you said "i have a feet room"😉 Legroom is okay as well. I like ur inventions they are jolly good.  Cheers
I love how you've added the diagrams.  Great setups too.  Subbed.
Love your channel and energy ! I use a very similar tarp setup as you do in the 3rd demo but instead of using a pole at the back I place a small rounded stone on the inside of the tarp and tie it out from the out side by tying a string around the tarp and stone. Gives you that added room...just subbed your channel and thanks for sharing 👍
Hi there I've just come across your channel & subscribed to you. What a great informative video. I to am trying to use tarps as tents are so expensive.
Very nice video really!
Well done, good vid. I like the setups ,in particular the last one. Just subbed you and look forward to seeing more.
Well done young lady! Just subbed! Awesome video!
I like the 3rd one as well! And one of my favourite setups is the plowpoint because it offers a lot o room as well as decent protection. Although for one person your alteration 8the 3rd one) is acctually a lot more practical. David
Nice Setups and very well shown with the good drawings! Thanks and all the best, Sepp ps if ppl. watch me filming and start to look funny, ...i start to film them, and they go away ;)
Love your video and your beautiful smile!  😉 My dogs name is Luna as well and she's a Shepard mix. If you are ever in California I'll take you for a hike in Big Bear  keep up the great work and look forward to seeing more of that smile!
rubber thing is a bungee cord
Excellent presentation.  A lot of fun to watch as well.  Keep up the great work!
neat, very fun demonstration. i liked it a lot.
Love the "architectural" drawings! Nice job! Hope to see more Estonian adventures!
I like the plow point myself. great video tks.
4:13    hammock.  always.
I like it, new sub here Thumbs up!!!
Thanks for these, I look forward to other videos from you.
Thank you for your smile and your fun. the little draw are very interesting.
I enjoyed this and some good setups
Great ideas :) thanks
Great channel, great videos.... keep going. Thumbs up...!!! Greetings from Spain.
Thank you very much!  You and your doggy are super adorable!
The number 3 it is look great, great video.
I have used a similar sized tarp. The first set up is the way i used it. The third one looks in interesting. Instead of a bungee cord I use a large elastic band. Watch some of my early videos.
Thanks for some good tips. Your 'genius version' of #2 is new to me and it is brilliant. #3 is totally new to me and looks like a 'no trees' alternative to the diamond tarp set up. For more room in the back you could use the 'wrapped pebble' tie out to a stake instead of the second pole inside.
I enjoyed watching that, some great tarp set up's thanks!
Hahaha, telling someone to take a hike in Scotland means telling them to f**k off, :)
Nice video! Nice channel.  subb. Very helpful. Lovey dog!! Luna in italian means "Moon". I have a german sheperd "Sun", he is my brother.. Check my channel. Cheers from Italy!!!! Roberto
Really cool video! Hello from Michigan! Cool video! Great job! Would love to hike there! I subscribed to your channel!
my new favourite channel, I've just finished watching all your videos back to back and I'm totally inspired to go for a hike, but I have to go to work so that'll have to be tomorrow. I've subscribed too, so I'm looking forward to more videos. great stuff. :)
Awesome and very entertaining! Subscribed I wish I could tarp tent more here in California but we have tons of Rattle snakes, Scorpions, and big spiders that Im always uncomfortable. By the time I throw in a Bivy with the tarp, the weight comes out to the same as a light weight tent! But it does feel good being able to throw a Tarp shelter anywhere.
I've used the first setup with my 3x3 only using a canoe oar as the center pole. Will def be trying out that third setup though. Thank you
Very instructive! Good idea to show the schematics simultaneously with the actual set-up.
Great video thanks. I like number 3 too. Here are some that I did that you might like to try also http://sdbwanderings.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/pimp-my-tarp.html?m=1
I really like these ideas but not sure how they would stand up to the rain and wind in Scotland? Maybe better for the Summer months?
I only watched that because you had a lovely face. who new abit of tarp was so handy. worthy and handy tips on how to use one
Hi....thanks for showing the tarp set up's.....the third one i like the most.... Cheers Chris
Flexible rope= bungee cord😀👍🏻
Kui maailmalõpp on lähedal, siis ma tulen definitely sinuga. Best chances of surviving. 👌
One of my favourite setup is a diamond type. Peg three corners. Trekking poles for the middle tie outs. The last corner makes a triangle and is guyed out. This probably makes no sense hahahahaha
kas niimoodi öösel külm ei ole?
