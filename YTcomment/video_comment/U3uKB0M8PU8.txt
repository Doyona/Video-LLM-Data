Guys, Jock itch is very uncontrollable infection which doesn't let us to do any work. I recommend you to stop Non vegetarian first. I have been infected for an year and came out of it. So stop non veg, don't go under sunlight more than an hour, wear cotton pants and loose, have good food and proper diet, use calapure lotion and creams advised by doctors. Dont go to local clinics as they will advise only branded products. Go to good hospital and make it done. Have enough water, lemon water, complete stop non veg for 1,2 years except egg. You will see major difference. Don't try any natural remedies in beginning. If it is thighs area, apply dettol antiseptic liquid 1 spoon with 2 spoon of water at the area. Apply for continuous one week. You will see improvement. It will burn but it will control itching. I have done the same. And then after apply any cream. If you feel burning sensation, apply ice and then after cream. Have garlic food, Green foods, Apple Cider vinegar daily one glass... Hope it will recover. For any doubts, comment here and i will reply.
Can i use it daily??pls reply
What do you recommend for cellulite

So y'all... My inner thighs are so dark they're like purple! I bought ground turmeric, olive oil, baking soda, a cup of Siggi's plain yogurt, and manuka raw honey. The yogurt really made it pasty. I put it on my thighs at 2 in the morning and slept at 2:30am. I woke up at 10:30am, used my brown sugar and olive oil scrub to get rid of the dry pieces and rinsed... And then I realized... Where did it go?!?!?! The dark spot, the length of my hand... Was GONE y'all GONE!!!! I think this should be sold in beauty care somewhere.   I literally just eyeballed everything.  I got a medium size cereal bowl and filled it about half way with turmeric. Then I added half as much baking soda. I added a lot of olive oil, enough to saturate thoroughly all the dry turmeric.  Then the manuka honey, the one I have is an 8 oz container so even if it looks like you used a lot you always have more when it settles, so about 1/3.  And then last but not least a cup of Siggi's plain yogurt. I am a fan of all their flavors but that one, too plain, so it's perfect for concoctions! The yogurt really makes it into a perfect batter, not too runny but like a pliable clay. I know this was not asked for, but I also applied it to my bits and my purple labia and surprisingly they are a shade lighter. Slower than the rest but definitely shows improvement!
Supeർ 👍👍sb Done👍👍👍
Can men use it also ?

Great remedy. Try this also https://youtu.be/7fokS0ykW-g
Its really look like amazing
Baking soda really works but not on everyone’s skin, like mine, whenever im using it, it irritates on my skin and end up having redness on those area. I just recently tried this cream “ponds cream” pink, the one with B3, and proper hygiene and routinely exfoliate(whatever you’re using) and after 2 weeks I can see the difference now. It’s not perfectly white but I can see the progress

IS THIS TRUE
You were great 👍
Wow she is good
If you are of color what do you expect love your self

uhg me too Zack Agyei it doesnt look nice
ok this is not only dark skin problem, I'm white and I have it too, I use hair bleech ( special for face and body) it cleans up the dead cells really good.  the other thing that cause this discoloration,  is dry skin, keep it moist with really good moisturizer!!! natural stuff like backing soda works ,but if u soak in the water and backing soda at least 3 times a week for 20 to 30 min ....and your skin look young ,bright and even.......🙄
are you a Jamaican
