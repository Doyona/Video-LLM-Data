Are you attaching the lashes to your skin or to your actual natural last? xx
can you reuse the individual lashes like you can with strip lashes?
This is probably my favourite look I've seen you do. It's so me, yet different than the looks I normally do, and it doesn't look too difficult. I really appreciate when you do more neutral, wearable, everyday kind of looks.
OMG you're freaking adorable!
I love your style! Your hair, your nails, everything!!
I've been experimenting a lot with make up lately and I was like 'hmm, wonder if I could find a good YouTube tutorial on individual lashes' I was catching up on your videos anD I SAW THIS. Sam, you read my mind. God love ya. ❤️❤️❤️✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻
perfect look <3
Sam, I've given up my hope on you and remembering the name of the RT accent brush 😂
I've become obsessed with your YouTube videos. I love how real you are!
those nails, gurl! stunning!
GTA 5 omg I died laughing! Girlfriend, I can relate LOL I love you so much hahah!
Can you do a video on after care for false lashes. After I take mine off, and they are covered in glue and mascara I just trash them. This stops me from buying good quality more expensive lashes. Where do you store them, what do you use/ how to clean them, how do you get them to maintain shape?  Love your videos, Sam :)
Does anyone have any tips for blending out gel liner? I just started using it recently and I'm not sure if its just the product I'm using or what, but I feel like it's impossible for me to blend it out the way I want.
Hey Samantha love your "makeup looks" and "how to's" :D. I was wondering if the Smith 230 brush is like the MakeupGeek outer V brush? From watching your application with it,  think it would really help me with applying eye shadow to my crease. I have used the Sigma E25 for applying and the E40 for blending. Albeit I tend to have my crease color close to my brows.Your thoughts and suggestions? :)  Mad respect for you.
nahhhh, forget the burFFFcontrol! lol I would much rather someone with a DNA workup like yours reproduce rather than most of the idiots out there that keep popping them out on my tax dollar while i work and bust my ass, as do you, while they sit at home and collect food stamps and a check. i work every day all day and can't get ANY sort of gov assistance. How does that work in canada? LOL way off the topic of makeup, i know. sorry. LOL you look gorg! as always!   your nails under that pound of acrylic, look long. why do you wear that stuff? it ruins your own nails so bad. File your own claws. I bet you have beautiful nails if you took take of them.
Perfect timing my dear. I just bought these HOL individuals & needed this exact tutorial. Thx for always helping me & making me giggle along the way. Wishing you a peaceful, SILENT, wknd. 😁
amazing. I'm defo gonna try mascara after next time. thanks for the tip ! gorge as always xxxx
Good lizard, moon spoon looks magical.
Best Individual lash video I've seen! I got got a set and I've been dying to try them but I couldn't get them to look natural.
You are so funny but love it! How about bottom lashes
Does anyone else find this camera angle really annoying? I love Sam and I love all the looks she does but I find this super zoomed in, half face angle really difficult/ annoying to watch...
Gorgeous!!
It looks so easy when you do it but everytime i try to apply eyeshadow on the lower eyelid I look like a racoon ... 🙈
Love individual lashes!!!
What is the super sparkly urban decay color ?! The gun metal color. I can't go back 😩
For most of Sam's tutorials.. I'm left staring at about 10% of the screen. The little itty bitty bottom left corner is all she uses lol
I laugh so much watching your videos, I just fucking love you.
I love when the birth control was mentioned!!! That was true idgaf moment, I love you haha
Am I the only one who think that strip lashes are way easier? Yes. Ok then.
In love ♡♡ :)
I'd love to see your take on big round doll eyes! Or a look with prominent bottom lashes (drawn on or fake)
With strip lashes you can reuse them a few times, is it the same with individual or are they a one time use kind of thing?
just wondering why you don't ever have lash extensions put in? I'm wondering if I should get them but I never see youtube make up artists with them so I'm not sure if its even worth the money.
you remind me of Khaleesi!
i have always struggled with individual lashes. they always look wonky and turn in weird angles! and I always seem to have a gap between my natural & fake lashes, do you place the fake ones on the actual lash or right where they meet the skin?
Anyone wanna be YouTube friends? ☺️
Did you take your BC? Don't forget!
thanks so much! I don't believe I've seen a video on individual lashes so this was super helpful! also just curious how they would apply and look on the bottom lashes, or if you have any tips for false lashes on the lower lash line. thanks!
hey girl, i wanna see an update of your favourite brushes please! what brands are awesome quality and affordable etc... peace x
Now she has to do the other side..
So do you place the individual lashes onto the skin as close to the lash line as possible? Or on the base of the real lashes? I'm confused, because I always placed them on the skin, but someone told me it was supposed to be adhered to the real lashes.
Take your pill! lol
Not sure if you specified, but do you place the individual lash onto your actual lashes (just close to the lash line) or on your skin (just close to the lash line)? Love your videos!!
You rarely do Smokey eyes! Do your fall version... from the bottom. I like to see you doing the full makeup, cause we can see your little tricks... also is when we can see your opinion on new products, etc! know what Im saym?! Yeah u know the drill! thanks and peace out!
YASSSS! finally an easy to do tutorial!
Hey Sam I was just wondering where you purchase your nyx products?? Im canadian like you & its not possible for me to drive to the states to get it :P can u help a sister out??
What glue is she using 😕
dont forget your birth control, sam.
Loving this look its bomb👌 I'm gonna have to give individual lashes a try now for sure
i rejected a guy today and he called me fatty out of spite. I came here afterwards to feel better and it worked lol that is all
you should totes be khaleesi for halloween
quick question guys, so do you not wait for the glue to dry or get tacky like with strip lashes???? does it not matter? cuz it seemed like Sam was just going straight in with  the individuals right after applying the glue.
I really liked this,  although I think it may have been a bit easier to see the lashes with a nude eye(at least for demo purposes). Do yu think one can just wear the individuals on the outer corner?
amazing!
How would you take them off? Like how do you know where they are?
Could you do a homecoming look?
🙍🏻😤Getting em to face the right way can be a biotch! Either they go good for me or they all refuse to cooperate. Yours look wonderful though! 💋
Best eyelash tutorial I've ever seen! GREAT JOB!!
I have done the long individuals in the inner corner for someone who had partially grown out her eyelash extensions and the extensions were kinda brick or brack. But it also depends on the eye shape.  I have used the very individual eyelash extensions, were it's literally a single strand of hair, but I don't really see those tutorials on YouTube. I have found extensions like that in New York but they are really hard to come by. Those are virtually invisible when on and help when you've lost a huge chunk of your eyelashes and need assembly line placement.
What foundation do you wear? and highlighter? it looks so dewy and perfect. *.*
Thank you so much Sam!! I am getting married and I've been googling "How to not cry eyelashes off?" to no avail. Hah.
"Remind me to take my birth control guys, because I just turned it off for you...." Seriously, I have to take it IMMEDIATELY or the thought is gone forever
Would you curl your lashes after applying the falsies, but before mascara? Did I miss you doing that in the video somehow?
Sweet lord I can't Handel this eye look 😩!!! Uhhhhhhh, fucking gorgeous!!!!!!!!!!!
Brilliant!
Please tell me which birth control you use, mine is causing so much up and down-ness with my weight and you stay looking great!!
hi sam you're always stunning !
why the fuck don't u have more subs. I'm not ok with this! you're the best artist ever!
Samantha, I keep trying to wear normal false lashes but no matter what I always feel like they are too long because I'm not used to wearing them. I really want to wear them occasionally when I don't wear winged liner, have you had this problem before?
I know it's really specific but it would be awesome if you did a video on top makeup tips/hacks for watery eyes, mine are the bane of my life and/or makeup lol
it's official. you make anything and everything look fucking perfect.
omg your hair colour is amazing. which one is it?
Hey Samantha can you do a video about your contacts and how you apply them with your nails because I'm getting contacts and it's so hard to put in especially if I had long nails
You are really good at that! also it looks so natural but time consuming but it seems worth it. Oh Reminder:be sure to take that Birth control. lol great job Thank you.
Do a video on your hair style!
I have always wondered... anyone can help! Why aren't eyelash extensions more popular? I know they are expensive but if you can afford it why don't more makeup gurus do that instead of bothering with falsies everyday? Thanks!
Thanks sammeh!! I'm no longer afraid of single lashes.. X
You're so cool 💕
Loveeee individual lashes. & this eye look 💪🏻👌🏻
Love u Sam
she looks so much like reese from legally blonde
what colour contact lens is she wearing. So pretty
i didn't see you applying mascara. did you just forgo on mascara? or did you apply it after?
Samantha when I film is happens the same the weird noises! Lol! And love the eyelashes they look so natural and pretty!
Can you make a tutorial or maybe some tips for hooded eyes please Saaaam
your such a tease!!! I wanted to see the tarte holiday palette:( I want!!
holy shit! your eye make up in this video. 😍😍😍😍😍
Tips and tricks for strip lashes
If you end up  having a baby in 9 months Samantha, I swear to God I'll never look at individual lashes the same again.
Question: Are individual lashes always single-use, or can you reuse them like strip lashes?
This is probably a stupid question but is it easy to remove them afterwards??
I'm loving all your videos you have been posting lately. I was so excited after seeing the name of this video because I had gotten some individual ones forever ago but never knew how to apply them. Now I know how to use them, yay!! thanks for teaching us how to use these!! :)
I see tons of tutorials online if I search (not that I'd really watch any of them aside from yours) but how are they maintained? Are they maintainable? I know tons of people clean their strip lashes and reuse and it's much easier to just peel those off, are individual lashes the same?
ILYSM. . .I came for the makeup but stay for your personality. Your videos never fail to make me smile ☺️
Your nails are gorgeous!!
I would love too see a tutorial on the urban decay vice 4 palette. and the too faced grand palais palette
love the colors! Is the tarte pallet you used the new one on sephora or its it the one on tarte's  website?
What's the name of the shimmery grey on the lower lashline?
soo glad you did this! i have been stugglin so bad trying to do individual lashes. I like the way they look much better than lashes on a strip but i have to bother my sister to do it for me. thank you! could you do a look with glitter freckles. its looks like it would be really fun for a party. or like a super over the top glittery lower lash line. i'd love it :)
So fancyyyy, love it babes <3
your eyes are so pretty. #jealous.
Hahaha you're so fucking hilarious.. 'I can't escape noises.. everyone on youtube lives in a majestic silent paradise' haha laughed so hard when you said that. Thanks for all the the tips you're giving in all your vids, you're fucking beautiful!
Wow This definitely made me realize why I should be using individuals more. Its such a struggle for me to put on falsies. The whole thing of putting mascara on after makes SO much sense. Now i am going to try that trick and see if it works for me. Thanks so much boo!
What is your lip color? it's such a gorgeous nude :)
can you wear fake lashes if you have watery eyes?
You are SUCH a life saver! I'm getting married next June & was so worried about wearing band lashes because of the inevitable tear shed. I'd hate to say "I do" and have a lash suddenly fall off😂 But thanks to you, I've found a solution! You the real MVP👌💕
wait which tarte palette is she using?
Very nice. God advice with the spacing. I can do my right eye fantastic but my left is a cluster fuck of craziness. Thanks for this will give them a try again.
Don't forget to take your birth control!~ awesome eye look girl! Love you!
How would you take them off ?
This was such perfect timing to show how to do individual lashes!! I want to wear them for my wedding and you've totally made it much easier on me! Thank you so much babe! Fuckin Lerve yew man
Are their any lashes that you can wear with glasses?
I'm getting married August 6th '16... (doing my own makeup yeah!) Totally using individual lashes <3
Wow you're rough. Such a gutter mouth
I'd love to see another video with Luke soon!
This is one of my favorite looks! So glamorous yet natural
absolute SLAAAAAYYYYYY <3. please list products in drop bar if possible, totally want to re-create this look i lahhhveee it!
hey I actually did learn something thanks haha
I know how to do these but I watched it anyway cause Sam ❤️
im obsessing over this makeup look too tbh 😍
What happend with your website?
Love these eyeshadow colors!!
For those of us who don't have the palettes/eye shadows, it is very helpful to see the the colors in the pan so that we can look for something similar in our collection. It's very difficult to recreate the look otherwise.
hahaha that so funny cause im litterally playing gta5 while watching this
dont forget to take your birth control   :D
you need to get the name of that real techniques accent brush tattooed on your forehead girl, you never remember it lololol
Can you talk about what birth control you use and your experiences using birth controls?
Just reminding to take your miracle pill (birth control). Even doe little Samantha's and little Luke's running around your house playing in your most loved makeup/other shit  would be amazing I know you probably don't want any kids right now. So take that  damn pill! ( which you probably did already but I'm late sorry lol).
I've always been so scared to do individual lashes because I've heard how strange it can be to get used to them. That being said, I really don't like strip lashes so I'm feeling a lot better about individuals, especially after watching this. THANL YOU! <3
This is awesome! Thanks for the tips Sam!
This just reminded me to take my birth control.. Thanks girl!
Love love this! I absolutely love individual lashes too!
I definitely learned something cool, I've always been intimidated by doing the individual lashes but you were really helpful and informative! I'd like to try them cause the lash strips do tend to bother my eyes sometimes. Also the whole eye look is nice, you look so pretty!
I literally just tried using individual lashes yesterday!! The timing of this was wonderful lol
I love how individual lashes look, but I suck at putting them on. I think I might be using too much glue or not letting it get tacky enough. They tend to slide around.
Lol, GTA 5. :)
Great tips on doing lashes ! It's so hard for me to do my own , but on other people I can do them like no body's business lol so weird
Ham hotel lol
Just reminding you to take your BC hahahaha seriously love you
You've been banging out videos left and right and I'm lovinggggggggg it!
beautiful! I've only been wondering recently, why most beauty youtubers are wearing fake lashes most of the time, instead of lash extensions. is it because it's costly or that you don't get to enjoy the variety of styles each day?
These look so natural and pretty 😍
I love individuals
You did a beautiful look 😃😃 love your channel and wearable looks that you do 😍 Would love it if you could do another green look....I would really love that 😃 Hugs
beautiful !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Haha the Real Techniques accent brush strikes again. You never remember the name of that brush lol. Beautiful makeup :)
So pretty
anyone else think sams voice is oddly relaxing??????
Love this! Could you possibly do a video on how to care for lashes? Like removal and cleaning and just basic information for beginners?
hahahahahah "remind me to take my birth control" I couldn't take anything serious after that too funny
sam, you should show us the eyeshadows you use on camera so we can find duplicates if we dont have the same palette that ur using. 😀😀😀😀 love you!!! xoxo from Puerto Rico
HAIR TUTORIAL OMG
Digging the lip shade here. You look flawless. Great tutorial. Thank you
Beautiful look, Sam. ❤ You're such a great makeup artist. You deserve everything you have and more.
Wow, that chrome color is incredible!
Slayin as perrrrr
I'm so glad you mention eyelashes being too curly. While I'm lucky to have very curly lashes this makes it near impossible for me to get strip ones to hit my lash line. I've practiced & that keeps being a major problem. I will have to try individuals to see if they work better.
how come you don't use the long lashes on the end like the longest length?  And this helped me so much i was in a car accident and have had 9 facial reconstructions and i have like no lashes on my inner corner so I'm super pumped to try using the single lashes. but I'm just wondering why you don't use the longest length on the ends of your eyes is there a reason or just personal preference. hope to hear from you 🌞 xoxoxo
Did you wait for the glue to get tacky or did you just pop the lashes on right after dipping them in the glue? If so, I need me some of that glue bc the one I have takes forever to get tacky and workable haha
You rock!
Ahh! I think you may have just solved my false lash issue! I always try to do them after mascara and my real lashes just get in the way. Next try I think I'll try doing mascara after.
i think i might actually aTtempt this.  I'm all about strip lasHes but for some reason just looked hard to do those but after watching I'm gonna give it a go. ..i think it's cool you can decide how they look based on what you use! great vid!
Those look so natural! Love it!
Just added that liner brush and tarte liner to the list of things I need in my life. Your tutorials give me life. Thank you for this I haven't considered trying individual lashes until now :)
Oh my god, I love how real you are xD
your nails are everything UGH i die lol
Gurl you better have remembered to take that birth control! And yea that gta5 joke had me dying too. I just love you ❤️
do you play gta?
I love individual lashes, but they take sooo long to apply :( xo
That eyelash curler 😱😍
Your eyes are so beautiful!
I'd love to see you make a video about cleaning makeup brushes PS i love your hair <3
Samantha, how do you keep the eyeshadow on the lower lashline in place? mine always seems to move or my eyes water and mess it up...
You make this look so easy! I can not get a hand of individuals lashes for the life of me! Strip lashes are my friends, they're much nicer to me haha
Love this cooler toned eye!
how old are you sam? love you!
