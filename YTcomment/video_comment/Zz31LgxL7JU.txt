Thank you ❤❤
Great tutorial; my only concern is that my chicken stuck to the basket (have similar fryer as yours) and I did not crowded the pieces of chicken and set at 350 temp.  Any suggestions, Thanks and God Bless.
sounds like john ritter
Wonderful 😊 keep them coming 💯💯💯 awesome fried chicken 🍗
Looks delicious
Where do you get the fryer? I keep trying this in a cast iron skillet and I always seem to slightly burn it. I can’t get the trick and I’m from the south so it’s hurting my soul lol
Amazing work
I've never made fried chicken before but followed your recipe tonight (with a twist): I added 1/3 Red Lobster biscuit mix to the flour and it was extra fluffy and light, still crispy. It was absolutely delicious. Thank you for making it so easy!
you pointed at 2 eggs with 3 fingers
Love this recipe!
I like your marinate method but l fully season the chicken first than marinated overnight.Was so delicious..
Those look really good! 👍🏾
The best chicken recipe it never fails you! This is the simplest and it comes out perfect everytime use everything he says don't skip
Looks delicious and tempting, well presented, thoroughly enjoyed the whole process and absolutely love the end result, thanks for sharing.stay connected.
I’m a southerner being taught how to make fried chicken by a Canadian, my the world we live in. Bless my heart
❤ looks amazing
Can I use Texas Pete in place of Franks? It all I have on hand. Will it be to vinegary?
Any chance you can use almond g flour and it would be as good?
Awesome 👍 chicken 🍗 on point 👍 you the man
It looks delicious 😋 I will try it tomorrow thanks 🙏🏾
Thanks
Nice and easy too thank you so much//:
Bravissimo!!
Thanks a lot for this amazing recipe. What i liked the best was it is simple and foolproof and the chicken was not too doughy. Just a nice thin crispy crust. Baking powder and hot sauce did wonders. The cooking time for my drumsticks was 11 to 12 minutes at 350. Wonderful recipe. This will be my go to recipe for fried chicken. Thank you so much.
Your video is great. Your recipe is simple and consise. I wish other cooks would learn to keep their presentation on topic like a Pro. TY
Man I've watched 3 different videos on how to make fried chicken in an air fryer and deep fryer. I like what you did because you didn't try to do too much in making it. Unlike the others, yours look cooked. So when I take a chance in making chicken fried, it's either the stove or deep fryer. Great work.
Ty
I use tapatio instead and freaken work😂 delicious chicken
Yummy
Very nice! I am convinced that the process should be repeated once more before frying...wet-dry, then wet-dry again.  Long live food...🥰
notice how he didnt wash his chicken before cooking. It because you dont have to. Anything bad that is on that chicken is gonna die when you fry it. Theres nothing wrong with what hes doin
👍👍
Yum! I'm gonna try for sure!
Awesome
I substituted Frank's hot sauce with Sambal Oelek and the regular flour for almond flour (since I'm on a Keto lifestyle) and it turned out delicious. Thanks for the recipe.
2022
👏👏🙌🙌👍
AMAZING VIDEO!!!🌻🌞🌻
Yummy
quick question can u fry them on a pan with a lot of oil?
Beautiful presentation a must try💯💯💯👍🔥
Thank you for not playing music thank you for talking and explaining what you have very excited to dry your recipe thank you for printing your recipe I so I could see it love the way it put this together excellent video two thumbs up thank you
still my go to bro i love this
Marvelous
What is the liquid it’s being fried in
Thanks bud, this video helped me out. Think I had my oil a bit high so the batter got a little bit burnt/crispy I did an extra two minutes as well. Still turned out pretty damn good though!
What if I want to cook more than seven pieces of chicken
Yassss I d I wanna see what you just ate we all do❤🤗😋🙋🏽‍♀️
Thanks for opening  up buddy very very nice video 😋🤗❤
Is it good for kids?isnt spicy?
that sound!! that CRUNCH!! amazing looking fried chicken 🍗
This easy and look good!
I found this recipe 3 years ago.....the ONLY way I fry chicken now!
I will try this today without hot sauce because I dont like hot sauce, I will go to the supermarket to bring ingrediants and follow the instructions on this clip and let you know.. Wish me luck 😉
I made these today but used vegetable oil. It was a hit so this recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you so much!!!!! 😋❤️
what awesome looking chicken bro
Thank you including the step by step instructions. Excited to make this!
Yummy 🤤, thank you so much 🙏
" wash ur hands with SOAP after handling chicken " so many chefs on youtube just ignore this and it hurts to watch lol thx for including it !
First of all i tried this mans mud cake recipe .. it was amazing .. now i look for the chicken drums .. and my guy still got my back xD all the love to ya man ! Hope 2022 goes amazing for u
Me and my girlfriend made this today, it was amazing 👏 first time making fried chicken this good and with chicken legs, so good we tried it with chicken breast into strips to and was really nice as well!
A good trick is to press on the meat to tear ot a bit in the flour
So simple and looks just right!! Color and all
Very tasty, easy,and Yummy.👍🏼
Is the baking powder necessary?
Ayo these look insane 😳
Making your chicken tonight, took me forever to find your recipe
Love this video I'm gonna try it now got the chicken in the fridge.
Yum will be trying!
I need your help. I don't have a fryer. If I cook in deep frying pan, should I still cook it for 10 minutes or more?
Thanks very much
Excellent!!
I made this recipe yesterday? And it is awesome, exactly how you showed the end results from frying the chicken? Crust was crispy. Keep those recipes coming
looks so good trying this weekend for sure
Making your chicken tonight
Looks amazing! Had to sub😉
Looks and sounds good ....well done .
You did that effortlessly. This guy is a pro.
I marinaded mine for 8 hours and added a few more spices.  The franks added such a subtle yet amazing character to the meat.  The breading was standard fare but the marinade is what sets this recipe apart. The whole family LOVED it. Thank you!
Just tried this recipe..... sooooo good 😋😋
Thank you so much for sharing My husband Love it God bless you and family Sir Fr: Mrs Taurus of Las Vegas Nevada
hes canadiamn
Still a good recipe
Very picky about my friend chicken! So is my family. No complaints on this round, we very much enjoyed this
I truly love how you add extra comments like “WASH your hands after touching raw chicken” because when I was little learning how to cook for my siblings I never had anyone tell me to do this so it wasn’t common sense to me. Until I got more advanced in my cooking. The recipe looks delicious btw!! Going to try this for dinner tomorrow!!!
Delicious just by looking at them.. Can I have one!
I thoughy instead of water use buttermilk🤔
The whisk stir is so satisfying
Trying this tonight 🍗
Good job
Hot sauce is normal tomato sauce ?
That’s how you get it done!
The best and most simple recipe!!! I used Cholula hot sauce (1/4 cup) and Huichol hot sauce (1/4 cup). They were better than Raising Canes tenders. Thank you for your time 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Between Brine and Marinade which one is better?
But which one is 180 c from 1-12?
I've seen many many videos here on YouTube on how to fry CHICKEN  This video was amazing ! The chicken looked like it came from a restaurant! Yum
ignore me as i write down everything he just said for later:  one bowl with two eggs, a 1/4 cup of water, 1/2 cup of hot sauce. whisk that shit. as 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. 1/2 teaspoon of salt. 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. stir. dip drumsticks in that bitch. cover with plastic wrap, let sit for at least 1/2 an hour.   dry batter. 1 cup of all purpose flour 2 teaspoons of baking powder 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder 1/2 teaspoons of salt 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper add anything you want  dip chicken into marinade, then coat in flour.  deep fry at 350 degrees f or 180 C
Thank you for this wonderful recipe😆
This guy whisks like his life depends on it!
What type of fryer is that?
that looks great, but we only like white meat, so how long do I cook a breast for and a wing tooo, please!!!!?
Is it still 350 if I use vegetable oil?
Nice
Nice video, but it's beyond overkill to have  your channel name on the screen in 3-4 spots throughout the video. That's just not cool. Thumbs down any time I see that. Sorry man.
Yummy
How long do i have it cook on the stove top,
Good job and great video.
Thank you so much. This is the best easy recipe ever!
It is 4 19 am! Im going to try this at 5 30!
what brand of frier did you use Sir?
I want to cut up and deep fry some cornish game hens, make little bitty 8-piece bucket. I’ll use this method.
yummmy im hungry....thank you
im cooking this tonight very simple very straightforward!
The best yet thank you 😊
They look very testy. Thank you
Sucess!! Just made this for dinner used the buttermilk. Added poultry seasoning in the liquid.  Added smoked paprika and a tad bit of red pepper to the flour. Everything else the same. Awesome!
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 THIS is how it's done! That's seasoning and flavor not just salt and bland flour! Looks delicious 😋
Awesome recipe 👌, question though. The last 2 time I made these they turned out really wet inside. Thought I knew why, turns out I didn't. Any ideas what's causing my chicken legs to be wet inside?
This recipe was a hit!!!! My bf and I loved the chicken I made all because of this video ❤️
Thank you this recipe is so yummy
Did you wash that chicken first
Oh, wait.. I thought this was a KFC order window... Sorry, I'm baked like a pro!
Can I use tapatío ? 😂
Nice...!
Just did you recipe today and I like it thanks
Hii sir.. I'm from India.. can u plz make  a original KFC recipe plzzz waiting
I didn’t know you also did non-baking videos 😂 I’ve tried your cake, pizza and cookies, and they were all so good! I’ll try this one next ^ ^
looks good yummy thanks for the recipe
👍👍👍👍🌹🌹
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️
Awesome. Just bought a deep fryer. Was a tad bit intimidated but this video def helping. Doing this tonight
I like it....great illustrations and instructions....gonna try mine like yours.....
Made fried chicken once and it came out bland:( tip anyone ?
❤️😋😋😋😊
Fantastic and superb. Thank you for your painstaking work more grease to your elbow and more wisdom always.
Thank you for the recipe AND for putting in there, wash your hands with soap after touching raw chicken.  Some people are scared of soap and water so they think if they rinse their hands in water, they’re really washing it.  And I’ve seen people simply just wiping it on a towel. Soap and water is the best!
Wait for me I am on my way, yummy!
Amazing. Can we do the using just a pan instead of deep fryer?
Ymmmiesst thanks for the recipe
That chicken look so pretty
Do I put the chicken in the refrigerator for an hour right?
Awesome video👍!  Other videos go to fast with the ingredients!  Yours is perfect like your chicken 🍗
it was great you show the inside thank you
Trying this now thanks 😊
Wow so nice
Yummy
Very good recipe mad em so hungry 😋
Just tried this and it great thank you for making such an easy to follow video.
I wanted to let you know that I worked this recipe  this past Saturday. I did take some picture of the end result but I cant find a way to share them with you. I had a bit more time to marinade the chicken - over night to be exact. I couldn't wait for the electric fryer to arrive so I used the giant out door propane fired fryer I use for Deep Fried Turkey - the only way to do Turkey. I used Whole Chickens which I cut into pieces. The Chickens I had must have been mutants. The Breast was HUGE. You only used Legs and so I took your timing and worked from there. I got the oil to 350F, this is very hit and miss with a propane fired fryer, but I'm pretty practiced making the adjustments on the fly. Remember the Galloping Gourmet? He would always add a cup of wine to the Cook? yeah not this time. I got the Chicken to Room Temp before frying, Breasts - I had 2 split so 4 individual pieces - set the timer for 20 minutes and dropped them in. At 12 min I dropped in the Thighs, at 10 in went the legs, and at 8 in went the wings. I was able to keep the temp close to the 350F and when I pulled the basket out of the PEANUT OIL they were perfect!  We let them cool for only a few minutes, family could hardly stand it. There were 6 of us. Two whole chickens cut into pieces - 16 pieces total. Legs were gone, Wings, gone, 1 thigh managed to make it to the Fridge but didn't last the night. We got two of the 2 pound breasts - yes each were two pounds these things were HUGE!! - into the fridge and by lunch the next day they were gone. Thank you thank you thank you for sharing this recipe with us. It is NOT too spicy. There is a hint of Tabasco flavor so if you don't like that then avoid the hot sauce. If you have any other marinades, please share and if there is a way to share photos, please let me know. This is truly part of our hit parade... and the electric fryer will be here in two days... wah hoo..
I know that this is a bit old, but, how did you choose your fryer?
Do you have to use hot sauce?
This is very helpful, thank you.
It's look so delicious
Can this recipe used for chicken breasts and wings?
Really really thanks man. Been waiting alot to get a good recipe for a fried chicken and that was really good. Subbed for sure
You did a super job with fried chicken
Don't be shy put some more😂
Wonderful
hello, incredible video.. would siracha work for this recipe?
Hah no more bread crumbs on my wings thanks
Looks wonderful, but I don't have a deep fryer 😢
Nice to have clear instructions. Some Youtubers use poor grammar, poor editing  and dont give enough details. This guy covers everything we need to know.
Finally, all I want was just a simple good recipe, Evey other ones were sooo complicated or didn't even show the seasoning but the batter. THANK U😍
Best fried chicken I saw 😍
Hello, your recipes are always on point!  Please share what fryer you are using to fry.  I think i would rather use a fryer for temp consistency rather than not.  Thanks and all the best to you!!
SO EASY
your excellence bro
Great recipe! just made this with chicken wings today and came out perfect!
I truly appreciate you!!! This is my all time favorite way to fry chicken now. It turns out like you got it from a restaurant. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 I did it the way my mom, and grandma made it but, it wasn’t quite right. You made me and my family HAPPY...👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽....Yayyyyyyy!!
Really nice video...
In love 🥰😍
hey bro I like your cooking process ,it is very nice and in a clean way which u have made it  ...I really like it ...😛😘👍
Thank you
When it comes to fried chicken, drumsticks are easily my favorite piece, those look damn good!
I just got my first deep fryer. Been frying chicken on the stove since I learned. So using a deep fryer will be a little different. Will give ur recipe a try 😊
Perfect just made this turned out great the family loved it thanks
I made fried chicken yesterday and I had such a hard time controlling the temp, even with a fry thermometer. I don’t have a deep fryer like yours tho...
is there a written recipe?
cooking changes for those without that fryer?
It looks great btw. Trying it tonight but I don't have baking powder
Is there something to use instead of baking powder
This was my first time cooking chicken  and it a came out perfect I 100 percent recommend this food blog!!!
Can you please tell how can we make a chicken spicy. like when we bite it will become red from inside. kindly reply. I m following your videos
Save me some homie that looks good u feel me
I've never made fried chicken before but followed your recipe tonight (with a twist): I added 1/3 Red Lobster biscuit mix to the flour and it was extra fluffy and light, still crispy. It was absolutely delicious. Thank you for making it so easy!
I made this tonight and it turned out great, thank you!

Awesome video ♨️♨️
Very good chicken.
going to try it today, thanks for sharing....
My son just bought me a deep fryer for my birthday.This is going to be the first recipe I try..It looks so yummy..
where did you get your fryer from? And if frying in a regular pan how long would you leave them in for?
I like  100%
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww exellent
Are we allowed to wave our perfect drumsticks in the air, stop traffic and scream like a madwoman *"my search for perfect fried chicken is over, woohooooo"* ☺️
Had issues with the breading sticking to the basket and other chicken. Any advice?
Wow I love eat 👅👅👅 I'll try this soon 👅
What purpose baking soda , and Baking powder
I'm going to try this. I might leave out the hot sauce though.
I thank you
Made this tonight.. OMG>>  So good, its a keeper.. Better than carry out. Only difference had to cook my legs 12 min. and thighs 19min.   They were bigger. But so crispy and juicy tender in the inside.
I tried this, it's the best fried chicken I ever cooked. But I did add 2 extra minutes to the cooking time. I couldn't stop eating.
How long to cook for thighs?
2016 no 2017 no 2018 no 2019 yes
Awesome crispy...
I love to watch people on how they make there chicken...
You from Canada? What's that all aboot?
Looks great. For real. I can tell you know what you're talking about. Nice
Thanks for sharing and you r calm for explaining
hi! is the baking powder necessary for this recipe? TIA!
I just tried to make this and my chicken browned way too fast.  My chicken was not cooked well enough after the 10 minutes. Was still pink with some blood.  I figure it must be one of two things.  My temp was too high, or the fact that I used vegetable oil instead of peanut may have been the problem. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Thank you
Good recepi👍👍🧡
Damn just made it, really good taste never going out for chicken wings again lol Best chicken wing ever 😀
I been looking for a recipe like this. Im going to try this.
Hi can you plz give me all the powders  name that you used in this recipe.?

Looks amazing frying the Mrs's and myself some of this tonight. Also joined and shared your face book page. And a subscriber. Thanks for the recipe. and the homemade buttermilk trick.
ten minutes is not long enough for dark meat.  I'll bet there is blood around the bone.  but the recipe is absolutely great
And do we have to use cornstarch
Can I use tapatio insted
I love fried chicken!
Do you have to add baking powder ?
WOW!! Such an easy step by step recipe and such great results. 5 star cooking has never been such easy. Thank you for simplifying it such. JCM: Nairobi

hello chef. can you show me the pepper of the brosted chicken plz
Hello, BakeLikeAPro, I should like to ask these two questions: 1) Is this recipe applicable to any part of the chicken? 2) What would happen if one were to put the chicken pieces in the deep fryer without marinating or adding the coating?
I'm hungry now, shopping tomorrow i guess.
Omg! This chicken looks so good!
Can Chicken Breast be used
Can you use this recipe with Chicken Breast turnt into Chicken Tenders
chickens on hit, great job, must try the baking powder batter looks excellent.

Glad to see fried chicken on Bake Like a Pro.  My motto has always been, "Why bake it, when you can fry it."

That's some fine baking right there!
Finger licking good. Good tip about washing hands after touching raw chicken and also wash areas where raw chicken has been.
can i just use a normal milk? then add some spicy sauce?
is it okay if i use skinless chicken ? will i still get that crunch?
I should put it in fridge
could i use any other sauce than hot sauce like barbeque sauce
i didn't use the marinated for the chicken as in your video coz idh hot sauce,but i replaced that with curry powder+fennel powder+cummin powder+black,white pepper....that's the available ingredients..but i do love the coating,it's super crunch!!i just use flour+pepper+salt and a lil bit of cumin for color...well,really thanks to you,now I finally able to figure a great crispy fried chicken..my family enjoyed the chicken sooooo much!! keep sharing easy and yet delicious recipe with us..😍😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💞💞💞
This is delicious at a party or something ;) thxx for the vid 😍
