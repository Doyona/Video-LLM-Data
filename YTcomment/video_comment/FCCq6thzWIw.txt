Still making it 10 years later
Still my go to mini cheesecake recipe. Share them with family and they’re enjoying them in 2024❤ Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.
Can I use milk instead of sour cream? 1/4 of what the recipe (sour cream measurement) cake for?
I’ve been using this recipe for YEARS!!!
What size cupcake liners are these? It says mini but the ones in the video don’t  look like they are mini.
I make these all the time! Love your recipe! Thank you.
I’m having a hard time finding this recipe. Can I get the recipe of this mini cheesecake
Healthy.  Tasty.  Mini.  Cupcak
Espectacular ❤ Gracias.
Still my go-to recipe for dessert! Even years later I’m here again to rewatch and make them for a work Christmas party. It’s the lemon zest sugar that knocks this out of the park.
Where is the recipe, what amounts of ingredients please.
Hi will I b able to skip egg
My cheese cake from your recipe new York is so good! I enjoy adding fresh squeezed 1/4 wedge and not baking the crust previously.  I enjoy the moist crust more!! Love this cheese cake.
Hi  how about without egg can we still bake them.
Hola qué tal me puedes decir cuánto sería  de queso   en gramos  gracias

Very good thy
Do we have to use sour cream? I don't have it :/

Albondigas siup
I wish you would give some mesurements
Ooh wee!
Wow easy recipe 🙏
Super easy to make and delicious 😋
Will you get the aftertaste of the lemon zest and the lemon juice?
Base: digestive biscuits much tastier.
I just discover this channel, I’ll make this today!!! 🤩
I want to make these for my mom's birthday I hope is likes them.
Instead of sugar i use condensed milk.....delicious!
Mam where we get graham crackers?
I’ve made this recipe many times and everyone loves them. Just wanted to say thank you for such an amazing and delicious recipe 🙏
I only have one egg . Need to make these asap! Will this still work ?? :/
Is there any substitution of SOUR CREAM. I cant find sour cream in the stores near me. Pls answer.
Can you also bake this recipe into just one big cheesecake?
What size of cupcake pans did you use or ounce?
Looks so yummy
you are so thorough🤩
What If I dont have a mixer
I JUST MADE THESE WITH A FEW ALTERATIONS. I ONLY HAD LIME BC I FORGOT TO BUY LEMONS. I USED LIME ZEST & LIME JUICE, 1/8 TSP OF SALT, & 2 1/2 TBS OF FLOUR 😊
hi , this recipe can make it in 6 inch round pan? notice me please
I wonder one thing. Why do americans always use unsalted butter and add extra salt? Here in Norway, that is unheard of. We just use salted butter for everything and don't risk forgetting to add any extra salt. I just don't get why you americans always, always without exception use unsalted butter. It makes no sense at all. Unless the unsalted version is cheaper? Is that the case?
Can we add melted chocolate to make it chocolate flavour ?
Hi there mam, i love your videos! May I ask will it be ok to manually mix the filling because I dont have mixer yet? -krizna from the PHILIPPINES
Hi Diane! First thing first, thanks for your recipes! They’re all just fantastic. I tried already your mini cheesecakes and I just loved them. Now, I wanted to turn your recipe into a gluten+lactose free one by using gluten free cookies and lactose free cream cheese/butter! Would it work? Do you have any suggestions? I’ll keep u posted about the results 🙏🏻
Hi Ms. Diane,  I am Jhoana from Philippines.   I have tried your mini cheesecake (#140) recipe yesterday and my husband loved it so much. I used blueberry jam (his fave) instead of strawberry and raspberry. May i just ask, i am planning to bake the same recipe however, I would like to use a round pan to make it one cake. Any suggestions for the pan size and cooking time?  Thank you very much.   More blessings!
Not everyone has a kitchenaide mixer.
Yummy looooooooooove this mini things

Hi Di~~ my kids wants to watch it forever. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Yummy
I need these in my life! Like every day...
How many cheescakes does this make
Hello Diane! I noticed you used unsalted butter in the graham cracker crust, then you added salt. Is there a special reason for not using salted butter instead?

Easy and delicious. Thank you for the recipe. My family like it.
Nice video.  I love the concept of the lemon zest sugar.
Hi can we use cabot cheese ?
It would help to have measurement. .very helpful for first-timers...or not!
oh i can tell it is tasty but I will work on the garnish. I will use whipped cream at the bottom and drizzle with chocolate syrup or strawberry jam on top. Then top fresh berries, one of each halved strawberry, raspberry and 2 blueberries around. And a mint leaf
It's 2017 and I've now tried this recipe. It is the BEST. Easy directions to follow. Make sure when you bake these you sneak one for yourself because when people taste them.......they love it and you risk the chance of not getting one yourself....lol Great recipe Di.

how long do you have to bake this using mini muffin tins? like those 1 bite size?
Can I use lemon juice instead of the zest? I don't have a fine grater :/
Hello Diane! I just wanna ask if ever I'm gonna make mini cheesecakes using the 24pc tray, how many minutes should I bake the cheesecakes in the oven using the same temperature?
Soooooooooooooooo easy
These look great..... I think I will have to give them a try.  Thank you for sharing.x

I made your ny cheesecake for Easter, and it was the best cheesecake I ever made. Your instructions were clear and it was so easy to follow along with your video and recipe. I would love to make these mini's for my daughters engagement party. Can they be made ahead? If yes how many days, and also what are your thoughts on freezing them ?

Great video!  I have always been more of a cooker than a baker, but you make this recipe look so easy that I have to try it! Thank you Di!!!
Thank you for this recipe. Really love your videos!
This recipe sounds very delicious. Talking about the crust, that's why I use regular butter because the cheesecake will have the salty hint, and because regular butter it's a lot cheaper.
Good tip, with the lemon peel into sugar...makes sense to basically flavor the sugar.
sour cream? ?? imma try without it
can i use mascarpone cheese?
This is amazing! Thank you Di!

Brilliant recipe! Thanks for sharing! I'll try these. Perfect for portion control. ;)
can i use yogurt instead of sour cream?
I was eating cheesecake when I was watching this video lol
Hi, Di! Is it possible not to put  sour cream? Does the taste still good? Hoping for your positive response. Thank you! 😊
Is it ok to increase the sour cream? What will happen if I've added more sour cream in the recipe?
What are the measurements
I added a small amount of the flour and it turned out to be great! The taste wasn't different just scrumptious .....
thank you
I LOVE this recipe! I already made these a bajillion times and each time, they came out perfect! Tangy, sweet, perfect sweetness and cream cheese flavor! I love it! Great recipe Diane!
Discovered your channel today. This recipe is amaze beans <3
is like water...
when I make why it is so wateryy
Great job. My only critique would be to make a proper fruit sauce instead of just using strait up jam, which is so heavy it's going to overpower the vanilla cheesecake. Using a basic cornstarch-thickened fruit sauce you can bring it to a gelatinous stage where the filling will stay put even when you cut into the cheesecake, and it will be lighter, with a pleasant translucent color. If you're going to go this far into making something so nice, it seems incongruous to just slop some store-bought jelly in there as filling.

Hi Diane, could you make a normal big cheesecake with this recipe? What would I need to change?

Diane, i love your youtube site, i have a important question for you:  I want to make a traditional apple pie about 5 days ahead of time and freeze it unbaked, can i do that and if i do it that way, how do i deal with this frozen pie when i take it out of the freezer and transport it for 4 hours by car to my son's?  Do you think freezing an unbaked apple pie in its pyrex dish is a mistake to do?   I don't want him to cook it and for it to turn out so bad he dumps it out, please let me know if you have anything to add to this question, thank's for a wonderful website, ray lowery  Reply  ·

Do we have to use lemon? I would prefer to not have that in my cheesecake.
I love making your mini cheesecakes
This sounds heavenly.  I'm going to try putting a whole nilla wafer on the bottom (out of sheer laziness) and make a half recipe so I can cook it in the toaster oven.  This sounds like a keeper.

Great recipe! But I have one question! I have one of those mini muffin trays that I wanted to use for this recipe. How long would baking time be for that? I figure since it's a smaller cupcake, it shouldn't take that much time to bake! Let me know! Thanks(:
Oh my goodness I am making them right now I will post them on Instagram ok what's your Instagram
Can u write down the recipe that I need to buy
love your show,, Greetings all the way from Thailand..
I have the same china as her the exact same set
This is awesome . Thanks
Hi Dishin With Di  can i use whisker instead of paddle attachment?thanks
Me gustan mucho !
Can I use the whisk instead of the paddle for the standing mixer? Because i don't have a paddle attachment.
Can i use yoghurt instead of sour cream?
Diane .....you are very good at cooking please show me how to make strawberry tarts!
Her bananas are spoiled. Look at the back
Nice work

Just made these Mini Cheesecakes as one of my Christmas Eve desserts!  Happy Holidays!  Diane
how many measures of ingredients u use ???????????
hi diane, love your video. but sometimes i'd wish that the camera was on whatever you're doing instead of your person (no offense) so that i can see what was going  on?
Awesome thank you for the video!!! By the way,, Love the red!!!
so do you think I can add peanut butter to this recipe and it would still turn out correctly
I'm going to make some of these for my uncle's store
How many sour cream i need? :(
You don't say how much of each! What if someone adds a little too much sugar then it would ruin the whole thing!!!
I'm going to make these for thanksgiving do I HAVE to have unsalted butter for the crust or will regular work just wondering I can always pick up unsalted butter (:
Hi... Instead of Graham cookies can I use vanilla wafers? Would it make any difference?

Just find your channel searching for good cheesecakes...

I have been making cheesecakes for 35 years that I got out of our church recipe book. I almost always end up with cracks in my cheesecakes. After the cheesecakes is done it has me mix up sour cream, sugar, and vanilla, put it back in the oven at 425 for 5 minutes to cook the sour cream on top. So how would I do that if I wanted to make the mini cheesecakes w/ sour cream on top of them. Can you please help me or do a video on mini cheesecakes adding the sour cream on top.
HI DI  i love your channel but for this recipe do you know what i can use instead of eggs? but thanks soo much the recipe

Can you give us the measurements? Thanks and congrats for your son!
Can you replace the limon for something else?
I find this a very delious recipe, it's just hard because you never say exact amounts of ingredients to use so it gets confusing:/ but besides that I love your work:) keep up the great work
Di, for the New York style & this recipe, can I use the flex edge beater for my stand mixer? To save time from always scrapping the sides. Just curious. Thanks! Luv watching ur vids. Can't wait for more.
The video was somewhat instructional it's just that you didn't give the measurements for anything
Seriesly can you dishin with di

Very cute little cheesecakes!!! Good idea to make individual little cheese cups!!!
Hi Diane  Just took these out of the oven and they smell devine! Did the trick with the lemon and sugar, what a great idea! I put these in the muffin tin then put the whole tin inside a large rectangular deep pan and added hot water and gave them a water bath. They didn't crack at all!!  Thanks again!   Going to a BBQ today and taking these as a dessert. I'm sure they will be a huge hit!   It's Canada Day here in my country!!

Hi Di. I just found you on you tube and am delighted to see you have many great recipe's! Thank ypu for sharing this one on mini cheesecakes made in a standard size pan. I am thinking of making these but in a mini cupcake pan. How long should I bake for in the oven for mini's? Thanks ahead of time....Susie in Cali
do you have to use a mixer?
It looks so good
Dear Diane ... I'm from Brasil and love your recipe, but sometimes I can't find some ingredients; sour cream for example! What I should do? Thanks Débora
please don't take this in any offense but............. It annoys me how you don't say the exact measurement..... can you maybe please say them next time? please don't take it any offense. I love your dishes and especially your desserts! but it be nice to know the measurements...
These look awesome! I actually made them tonight. The only thing I did differently was that I made them with a water bath and that stopped cracks from forming.   I can't wait to top them and eat them! Thanks for the recipe!
Hi Di! Your expression when you bite the creaamyy cheesecake was priceless. Gonna make this soon. love youuu
Oh, these look soooo good!  Thanks for sharing, Diane.  Is the vanilla paste more potent (more flavourful) than the regular extract?  These would be great for a party.  These cupcakes are a good way to have portion control, as if we ever worry about that!  :)
Thanks for this one, Di! I made my mom the New York Cheesecake for Mother's Day. Took some time but came out great. I was wondering, have you made a video on how to make bruchetta? I'm craving that right now.  And congrats to you and your son. I graduated college last year and it's a great accomplishment!
I like your channel the best I think. You make everything g so simple. If I got this on a another channel omg .. Like nine hundred steps and a million ingredients ! Lol. Thanks
What a Pity... you had to eat it! lol.... Looks great Di. Congrats to your son and to you for 50,000 subs :)
