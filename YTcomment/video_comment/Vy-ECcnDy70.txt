Hello mate. Daft question but where have the hidden the reservoirs for the rear breaks.
And we don’t bleed the brakes out because?
Isn't there a retaining spring for the pads that no one seems to mention 🤔🤦
does any  one else think the rear brake on the 650 versys , are pretty poor as stock. Mines a 2007. Bled it twice but still not that good compared to my 250 ninja.
Thank you for not taking about half an hour to show us all how knowledgeable you are and just showing us what to do.
You didn’t remove the whole thing. I needed to see the the part you didn’t remove on the breaks.
merci ça ma fait économisé de l'argent
Nice Video, the best i saw about this changing pads... i couldnt get the name or what is that cream that u use to keep the piston hydrated?
I had a clip fall out of the calliper the size of my pinky nail. Could it be the pad separator or anti rattle? Problem is I don't know where and how it goes back in
I just did mine for first time. Didn't seem to need to compress piston...pushed it in a bit w hand. But new pads installed, slipped right back over disk. Brakes seem to work fine...did I miss something I should be worried about?
