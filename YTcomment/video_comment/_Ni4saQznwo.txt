Me I'm Irish-Italian from Portuguese Hawai'i.   I'm off-white, too, speaking Japanese Cuban TV english.  We love our manapua!
Char siu bao, manapua. The bread is ok,  the inside better!
Called Manapua in Hawaii.
Why do you talk in that annoying as fuck cadence
I like this food and the recipe is great.
It's all part of the plan because apparently I go waaaaaay to fast, like Lightning speed !!! 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🍿🥳🥳🥳🥳🙏💪💪💪💪💪👍✨🌈🪽😁💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Liar we are pros and very skillful we are God. Damn u still lying Jesus?! 😂😂😂😂😂 💪💪💪🙏👍✨🌈🪽🙌🤗😁💖💖💖💖💖🍿🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😋😉🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😆🕊️
OMG HE DID BAOZI!?
I love your cooking you're like imperfect like the rest of us. I don't know how to fold the bao bum too
One way to "cheat" that extra sweetness and color for this sort of short cut recipe, is to use some "plum sauce" or red sweet/sour sauce. It adds the color and honey missing from classical. Love manapua... they 'da bes'!
Might try building these with a sourdough…anybody ever try it?
No list of ingredients, no.
Perfect
I played the video game Sleeping Dogs, which is 10 years running since its original release, takes place in 2010's Hong Kong, and they have marketplace and  street vendor NPCs (non-playable) characters who offer food to the playable game character Wei Shen, who is an undercover cop who infiltrates Triad organization and uses mixed martial arts on his foes and evildoers. and every so often when I enter the marketplace, the one vendor sells char siu bao, steamed pork buns and his favorite phrase is "A man who never eats pork buns is never a whole man!". when I see him, I pay the virtual 25 Hong Kong dollars which is equivalent to about 3 American dollars. there was a female vendor who mentions "char siu bao" instead of calling them steamed pork buns.
The ole poka poka
Thank you Sir
I like the baked ones more.
I love your honesty but this recipe had several no no's. Filling should have been traditional...you put cayenne??? Re: your dough you should have folded layers b4 rolling & cutting the dough...And your rolling method was floored...sorry chef I usually just love your recipes but not this🙃
Omg, that pinch everywhere technique is definitely my technique too. This is so hard to make actually, I tried 5-6 times to finally accomplished the result like in this video. That struggle is real, trust me. Mine is always burst; because I put too much fillings everytime, lol.  Oh, to make it looks quite white, just use vegetable shortening, it quite help to make it looks not off white-ish. Now. i'm craving some of this. :'9
Ground pork and Korean bbq sauce is good.
Ergo Cogito Dim Sum:  therefore I think I’ll have a pork bun.
I love your take on cha siu bao!! theyre a crowd pleaser
Cha *siu bao
Just like chairman mao, he killed it....
And some coriander leaves.  Yummmmm
I love how you made it your own and usedwhat you had to hand
You made a delicious  pork bun
More than any other youtube chef/cooking channel, I trust Chef John. The only exceptions to these are Asian cuisine and Italian Cuisine.   As with most other professional chefs trained in the Anglo-Saxon schools, he really f-s up Asian and Italian food.
Chairman Mao killed at least 45 million people in four years. I know you're being cute or whatever, but I'm sure you would never say anything like, 'After all, you are the Hitler of your ginger'
"I dont mind the off white, I'm kinda off white!" 😃😃😃😆😆😆😅😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣
I have made Bao with bread dough from the freezer section and pop and fresh biscuit dough. Neither is as good as homemade dough, but it is quick and easy....
Try hoisin mixed with your favourite bbq sauce.  Quails eggs hard boiled are another good filing to add to the meat
Chairman Mao of your pork bao LOL 主席的水晶棺材板压不住了
The best buns I have had have less dough and more filling. Those things can cost 3 to 5 bucks a pop these days and it pisses me off when it'd mostly dough. Good job, John!
"A man who never eats pork bun is never a whole man!"
Sir pls share recipe of bao buns.
In SF China Town they use Staples printer paper and not parchment paper.   Been eating them for many years and you just need to cut off the stuck disgusting bottom 1mm layer.
After all, you are the Beijing, of what to put in your filling
Bao/Baozi is among the cutest words in the world!
hello chef hohn. these bao's looked really great.  i wanted to ask you a question. since we don't eat beef or pork, can i make these with chicken. thank you for all the great recipews
I'm using your recipe for this Lunar New Year, Chef. My ancestors will be having this, Chef. I'm trusting you.
I come for the recipes, I stay for the humor... 😂🥰
put some white vinegar in your steaming water to keep them bright white
The ones I used to buy were golden brown.
He talks like yoda sometimes
Using only thumb and index finger to pull and press the wrap can help make the creases very efficiently. It's not difficult, just take a lil bit of practice. Search for a video made by any Chinese and u'll see how.
sambal olek would be so much tastier than cayenne
Hungry now...
Some good ones at superstore.  But nothing beats more authentic food
I know I’m not the only one that says “Hello this is chef John from Food Wishes. Com wiitthh...” 😂
Hi Chef! I've noticed in the many videos that I've watched that when pinching the bao, folks use their thumb of their other hand to lightly push the filling into the pouch as it is forming. It slightly stretches the dough from the center and gives you more for working. Looks delicious. I'm making these as a Thanksgiving treat. Thank you!
yest + baking powder ?? really ? I don't think so. Baking soda just kill your yeast so what you do is actually sodabread dough. Just throw your yest on the sink and your bread will be all the same. Or use regular flour and just get a little more patient with the razing.
True San Fransisco native, that's where I first had them!!! Cheers from Sonoma county!
How did they steam the next day?
and as always.. enjoy!!! :)))
Love these recipes and the commentary is fantastic, so entertaining and absolutely relatable to us regular people who love to simply cook. With love from Sri Lanka❤️
There's a dimsum place in NYC's China town that would bake a sweet egg glaze over them after steaming.   and now I'm drooling just remember them.
Chef while I'm sure they taste delicious them pork buns are ugly as me.
I did try these yesterday, but used a bit too wet of a flling, I belive. They were pretty soggy, but still good.
Most self-rising flours do not use all-purpose flour. They use lower protein flours all the way down to cake flour. Most of the time it will work using AP to make your own but every now and then it's a train wreck.
So please try to relax. What a great instructor. Thank you chef John!
Is it me or does this guy's voice go up and down, when he talk, like a sea saw
Wouldn’t be a food wishes episode with the good ol rhyme :) I always listen out for it :)
YUMMMMM!
Sri lankan steamed kurakkan & coconut sweets recipe ( Helapa ) 🌴🌾🍯 https://youtu.be/PA5NM8-AQzg
Could you make a video for steamed bao buns pleas?
This man talks like he’s both confused and out of breath, bless him
👌🏼🌹💚🥰😋😋
I'd like to make these but in my household there is no such thing as leftover ribs... :(   So I think I might sub a bbq chicken or something...
Chairman Mao of char siu bao 😂😂😂 I will massacre those buns!
In Hawaii these are called manapua and I'm not in Hawaii so this makes me happy.
The way you inflect at the end of each sentence makes me really uncomfortable lol
Exact measurement pls, good job, thank you n more power!
I diedl when you said,”I’m kind of off white”.
I prefer to deep fry them after steaming until the outside gets brown. I think the crunchy outside adds a texture element that the steamed alone buns are missing.
I don't think most people recognize the comedic genius in this guy. I crack up at every video.
OMG I love these things!
Did you really use a Mao reference for your  rhyme? The dude killed 45 million people. Do you have a "you are after the Hitler, of your lemon spritzers"? Bruh...
Wouldn't the self-rising flour kill the yeast?
The most annoying voice ever
You can buy little round parchment doilies for your steamers that cost very little money.
A MAN WHO NEVER EATS PORK BUN IS NEVER A WHOLE MAN
You're a good man
I love his videos. His voice is relaxing and calming. Oh, the recipes look good too.👍
I need to knead.
I watched one dumpling video and now there is so much Korean food on my recommended😂🤔
Mmmmmmm.do yummy
finally a recipie for steamed hams
To me the dried yeast is strange.  We always buy active yeast, in small packages of around 50 grams.  Btw. Self rising flour isn't an issue here. Flour is flour.  Although it comes in lots different versions, just not with any additives.
Love these things, tried them almost twenty years ago.
The good thing about these buns is that they always come out great, no matter how weird they looked when uncooked.
Ai mara this guys voice 😂😂😂😂👌
Is this person cooking deaf and the person speaking his interpreter? I absolutely love watching all these videos keep making them🤟🏻
😂 wth 😂😂 yum 😋
Scallions, also known as Green Onions, also known as Spring Onions...
I wonder if I can fry these. They seem really similar to potstickers...
Your voice is so bloody annoying
The way this guy talks like dr Seuss
Aren’t these the same thing  as typical Chinese Baozi? Generally eaten for breakfast.
the untold story Human mean roast pork buns,1992 anyone?
I find the sing-song nature of your diction to be annoying
Can you do a video of making pumpkin pie from a pumpkin?
I just think these would be alot better baked with a crispy crust than a soggy crust..🤤🤤
I have tried others recipes and the buns never turned out good. I will try this recipe. Steamed pork buns are my favorite!
your intonation is very peculiar
Where I’m from this is called POW. Love it 😋
you have to practice chef!
💞
Have you lost wieght?
You you are The BEST ❤️
Also called shopau in filipino cooking..basicly steamed. Fough filled with all kinds of goiodies
I feel like bulgogi is closer to a barbecue sauce in my opinion.
You, sir, are the best food channel on the internet.
Here's a shortcut u can use any frozen can biscuit dough just roll out with flour dust it'll save u half the time.
Chef John, I love your videos, I always learn so much from you, thanks
Genuinely curious to know if your voice goes up and down as much as it does in these videos. And with the exact same timing between the ups and downs 😂😂
You are the the phoenix suns of your char siu steamed buns
They may have been less filling, but they sure taste great.
actually char siu sauce is chinese bbq sauce. (char siu = prong/fork + burn/char/roast = bbq.) and hoisin (means seafood) is oyster sauce which is a component of char siu sauce.
Garlic... Garlic.... Garlic ....
Hey there chef , i am a dim sum demi chef , we have few methods to make these barbecue buns . The best variant  is the hk barbecue bun , which the dough is fermented for days. And we will use our thumb to press the content , and we fold it in a completely different method. Hope to contact you to exchange more info .
Shaggy dough man we don’t deserve him
A man who never eats pork bun is never be a whole man
I admire your honesty and coolness with the lack of technique with the pinching.  :-)  Also, I believe the traditional bao uses a 50-50% mix of cooked/uncooked pork. I am sure yours turned delicious as well.
You're too adorable Sir😉👍😉
So this is basically Nepali Mo:Mo with pork instead of chicken or buffalo
Subscribed! :)
In the Netherlands they called bapao. Hmmmm
you need to practice hard the pleating part.pork buns are not yr forte ;)
I make these breakfast style with scrambled eggs, veggie sausage and cheddar cheese for the filling. They turn out so amazing and delicious.
Chef John is just so funny...and real. Makes cooking more enjoyable :-)
What an extraordinary combination of brilliance and hilarity! thank you Chef John.   :)
Thank you. I love your channel ❤️
“and theoretically as you do these each one will get a little better although not for me this one looks exactly the same! but hey at least I got sauce on the dough”😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 got me in tears 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chef John, the King of puns, of steamed pork buns.
ء🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️
Whoa I'm surprised he didn't add the sugar earlier for the yeast to eat!  I do not question chef John's skills😅
I've never tried to make these but it doesn't look as intimidating now, thanks.
You son of a bun ✌️❤️😁
Speaking of pork buns,  Andrew Yang Humanity First 2020
I actually made these! the first time i followed a youtube recipe...I never had buns before but my GOD! Alot of work, but it was all worth it! Thanks!
I’m conflicted with this channel. I love your videos but you talk in a really annoying way that I have a hard time articulating. I think it’s the way you end every sentence with an upward infliction.
You so shaved your hands lol I love chef John bro
My humble personage baos before your grandeur.
I can't beleive there are people disliking Chef John's videos. He's so wholesome and corny how could you not love him
Sweet steam buns recipe please sir.
Not sticky because of the vegetable oil.
I have seen Asian women put a towel then the steamer lid. So the water vapor doesn’t drop on the dough and make the dimples.
Fun to watch the Chinese ladies whip these together. A bun every 6-8 seconds or faster. Years of doing I guess. In Hawaii they are called Manapua, and as a teen we would take the bus to the beach for 10 cents, then after surfing got two buns for 25 cents each and a snow cone for the other 50 cents of our dollar. Best value on the island!
at first your voice annoyed me, then i got used to it, now i like it, its unique
His voice is sooooo annoying.
Very Nice, you definitely know the techniques for the bao!
He who never eats pork bun is never a whole man
The different emphasis on all of your words is so interesting
Being married to a Vietnamese I have eaten my share of Bun-Bao.  Either your lump of pulled meat is too large or your dough needs to be rolled out larger but not thinner.  Cut your dough log into quarters instead of sixths.  You'll get a thicker shell on your Bun which is how most do turn out.  Those are some of my favorite foods, but considering the Calories each has, it is not something I'd pop in my mouth and eat like I would with doughnuts.  The larger ones you can purchase in the Asian stores are almost a meal in themselves.
At the end of the process I would put them in a hot oven for 15 (?) minutes to brown and crisp a little.
I like your approach, all done by hand and going by heart, not by measurements. And encouraging use of leftovers! :)
I love your videos but your up down Rollercoaster voice gives me a migraine. I mute with subtitles :)
Great video and baos. But don't use dumpling flour. Dumpling flour has the gluten washed out, so you cannot make good dough with it. It is used mainly for Chinese dumplings.   And this is the northern style bao. Bao in dim sum restaurants is Southern style known as Cantonese style bao. Just want to mention this in case anyone is interested in trying different styles of baos.
I love this guy even though he's from the west coast.  :)
now do soup dumplings
Question to Asians: When you were young did your mom tell you to peel off the smooth surface of the bao before you eat because that is where the chef's hands had touched?
In the Philippines we call it Siopao.
Chinese seal of approval.
Love the recipes but cant stand commentary(do u rlly have to talk like that)
Your intonation confuses me
Pork buns.....lk..
How steamed Knishy of you! Why do you use self rising flour?
Chef John is indian? Has an indian accent!
I love these ! Looks tasty n easy to make thks!
Use to eat these when I was stationed in Guam
The way he talks is annoying...
You are hilarious!
很好唷！ 其實不但可以做成用蒸的包子，其實還可以用平底鍋做成用油煎，或是油+水做成水煎包.........
You are the best Chef, very funny!!!
Oooohhh. That's why mine were dry. I didn't leave them covered for 15mins after they were cooked
I  cannot listen to up and down stretched out then shortened tones of his voice.
Who els is hungry at 2:00
香港人如果看到這個飽,一定開心笑出來
I love your videos and your voice you make it sound so fun!
i try one of your recipes the pateis  de nata it was great thank you.
Love your videos! Hilarious!
Why does he talk like that?
Your recipes are close to impeccable.. But what's with your voice/intonation ????🤔🤔🤔 Irritating...
what are "left over" ribs. I don't understand.
you should do radio.
Honestly, I like all your videos, but you couldn't do this recipe perfectly, but in any case I like your Chanel
I would love to be able to bake Portuguese Corn Bread.  Chef John, can you help?
I like ur videos..especily it has no music thnku
Made these yesterday - fantastic!  Great recipe, easy, and tasted great.  IMO very close to those from bakeries in Chicago's Chinatown.
Why do you sound so much like Seth Rogan lol
This guy says everything in the same tone of voice
How do you clean bamboo steamers?
Yummy
*The ol' polka polka*
Do you purposefully put inflections on random syllables?!
Or... I'll just keep going to Yank Sing
Extreme Roller Coaster narration will drive you insane as you watch this otherwise informative video
I’m kinda offwhite.. hahaha so funny
Amazing ...not just the recipe but your sense of humor too. Loved it.
I love your  channel! I watch every video! I make tons from them.   During the video you said your technique wasn't so good. I watch an channel called "Strictly Dumpling" He is awesome as well... this video he makes Pork Dumplings and shows how to form the dumplings in 2 angles & slow - mo as well. You used cooked meat and his is raw which is why the timing is different. He also uses the white flour. Anyways... Here's the link:  https://youtu.be/qvOBLYVWPYY     I hope it helps :)
Was the dough fine to keep overnight?
I am going to use a cheeseburger filling!
wibble wobble wibble wibble. shaggy shaggy libledible. smooth
Nice. Only thing I would recommend to alter is: There is absolutely no need for the Baking powder. Really, it just gives the buns that terrible baking powder taste and mouthfeel. Just let the yeast do it's thing, they will come out gorgeous all the same.
What did the dog say after seeing this episode? Bao Wow!
your arms are super hairy...
You sound burger king foot lettuce
And as always..enjoy. My fav part
I love your style. LOL!
Haha you are hilarious
Why do you raise and lower your voice? Is there a reason? Love this channel just looking for an answer haha
I absolutely love your channel Chef! Fantastic :)
Oh my god your speaking cadence though is like a 3rd grader doing a book report aahhrjhtgjfdlkgfdg.
that,s not chinese  its our traditional dish (of Gilgit Baltistan ) we call it #Mamtu <3
Thank you for all your great recipes and I love your voice.I notice your voice  because my brother is an anime voice actor.
wow, that was awesome!
Hey Chief, Hoisin means seafood, so hoisin sauce means seafood sauce.
You're voice is like a roller coaster!!
I recommend to mix a little butter to the filling. It will make your dumplings juicy 😋
(3:03) - (...and also known as Spring Onions over here in the UK.)
(0:36) "...and as usual, that'll begin with some warm but not too hot water..." "Some" warm water? "SOME"? How *_much_* warm water? How *_little_* warm water? Does it even matter?  You know, I really enjoy following complicated recipes to the letter. The more complicated, the more enjoyment I get. But when I come across quantities such as "some", as in this one... ...Honestly! It drives me *_NUTS!!!_* I CANNOT BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM. THAT'S WHY I'M USING ALL CAPS. YOU KNOW WHAT? F-U I'M GIVING UP RIGHT HERE AND NOW. JUST, I GUESS, LIKE SO MANY OTHERS. JEESUS. YOU FAT-FUCKS JUST DON'T GET IT. SHADOW BANNED? TOTALLY BANNED? I DON'T GIVE A FUCK BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT THERE, THEN I KNOW YOU READ IT. GOODBYE SIR. THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE MY CRITICAL COMMENTS SERIOUSLY? WELL, THAT'S DOWN TO YOU NOW, ISN'T IT? XXXXX LOVE YOUR CHANNEL BY THE WAY BUT THIS ONE VIDEO LET YOU DOWN BIG TIME. PLEASE EMAIL ME ON chocksaway@bodragon.com and I promise to get back to you.  Well, All the best then. Chuck Bodragon
His voice isn't like this normally. This way of talking is so annoying. Stick to the website. You won't want to put a sharp object in your brain.
The Chairman Mao of your bao? You've got to stop this, lol.
For the past few months I have been trying out different recipes for bao dough. This recipe here turned out best, light, soft and fluffy... I'll stop my search here and this will be my "go to" bao dough recipe.
This is the fun recipe, and thanks for making it. I’ve just got to say there such a strange cadence do your sentences there’s a lot of up-and-down and emphasis in odd parts of the sentence with a lot of stretching of the last few words of each sentence.
I like this guy but his pentameter drives me nuts!  Thanks for the great bao!
WHOA! Maybe use the sloppy joe tip for filling these.
Mainly watched this to learn how to use a bamboo steamer, but I might try to make something similar to this once I do get a dedicated steamer. I don't eat pork, but I can see doing other crazy things with chicken, or even veggies. I like how you came out and said you were making these with leftover meat. Really gets one to poke around the fridge and think, "Huh, will this work...?"
what would make the filling better or more authentic?  any tips?
Lol why do you talk like that you get higher pitch at the end of you sentence
I just made my request on your most recent vid but I thought I’d leave it here too bc this recipe is why I thought maybe you could do it.... my food wish is a steamed bun like this but with sweet egg yolk custard filling instead of the savory bbq pork.
Red beans more delicious
<3
I’m going to make them sweet and spicy for sure!
Please tell me your trolling with your voice. This low to high to low is killing me.
These are SO addicting! I worked at a salon where a lady I worked with made these from scratch and they've been my favorite ever since! Lol
another homerun
Could you please make pelmeni, the russian dumplings? They taste so good!
I wish you gave actual measurements instead of saying like "a little bit" because that's not very helpful at least not to me
I love your videos. But your voice is just hard to listen too.
Good job on making me laugh
But why is your voice so annoying ?
Is chef john john c reilly?? 😂
@1:26 i thought he was breading a chicken quarter
Love it
The enthusiastic pessimism x)
Lol, the ones in the City (SF) are more like pork jelly donuts :) Oh yeah baby sweet!
One of the best cooking channels in youtube!
Wow!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe. You always make good food, I think you must be part Asian?
So what does dead yeast look like? Lol
8:11 fancier way to say 'fake it till you make it'
To get the buns really white, put a bit of vinegar in the steaming water
Your voice is very calming
I love this guy's voice and speech quality. Wish he could read me bedtime stories and cook all my meals while i listen to him talk endlessly. :-)
I actually prefer your bun-to-filling ratio better than most Chinese restaurant's version.  I always feel a bit cheated at the mostly bread and a thumbnail's worth of that delicious meat.  And being a savage meat eater, who cares if the pinches ain't perfect, if it tastes awesome!
I've seen these buns on Chinese menus for decades, but hesitate to try them because steaming a yeast dough just doesn't sit right with me. I'm accustomed to sweet and savory bread products have been cooked/baked to a golden light or medium brown.
Yo ta momo ho
My family uses milk for the dough!
Hi. Can you please help me ? This question is not regarded recipes. How you are uploading crystal clear videos.? I have just started the channel and my videos are not clear as I upload. Heard YouTube would shrunk the quality. My videos were 10 min and 7 minutes. I am asking you because I started a channel by your inspiration. Watching your channel for the past 3 years. Please help me.
You had me at self rising flour
Every single sentence has the sharpest pitch change at the end
Is it possible to deep fry it?
I made pizza rolls using this technique.  Was really good.
1:25  Which is just like a regular dough, but it likes snacks and solving mysteries.
You are the Chairman Mao of your Char Siu Bao
Hmmm... it’s called *SIO PAO* here. My most favorite is a Pork Asado Sio Pao... i could eat way too much if it wasn’t that much of a carb bomb.🤤 It’s so soft, warm, and meaty in the inside UGH
the sing songey voice grates me, and it wasn't so pronounced on your older vids, but i still subscribed
so funny this video
Needs some hot oil.
Dudeeeeeeeeeeeeee I love your videos and recipes. What "drives me up the wall" is hearing you say " I'll go ahead" bla bla. Is this a mid west thing? Or you say I went ahead.... please help me understand.  Best wishes and thanks.
Can i use roasted chicken as the filling?
I love Bao, but I would also love to try them with buffalo chicken as well >.>
the bob ross of cooking tutorials
WOW! My mom would be so impressed by your technique! I sure miss my mom's cooking wish I had paid more attention to her cooking! Oh the memories! Thanks for sharing! I'm definitely going to try your recipe!
WELCOME TO MY show.
This is similar to manapua char siu filling in Hawaii we call it manapua eather baked or steamed
You are, after all  The Chairman Mao Of your Char Siu Bao!
I enjoy your voice sir. This was a good video.
Nice Muslim Dish....
I think this would be a great use for left over turkey after Thanksgiving :)
Omg he says everything with an upward inflection... (voice trails off as going higher pitch)
Your downward inflection can make it really hard to hear what words you are saying sometimes. Especially for ESL folk.
Chef John I made your recipe yesterday.   I like to follow your style of cooking technique    They looked and tasted as I remembered them in years past.    I used a $1.19 package of Premixed Bao flour I had.   I folded them like you did and let them rest a while before steaming.   I had a bit of BBQ pork in the freezer that I had left over from the Song Dynasty.   Then I made the filling with TONS of onions.   Onions flavored with BBQ pork.         I really like pork buns.   I ONLY like pork buns.   I've tried chicken, vegetable, stew, curry, 5 spice beef and the Vietnamese ones with hard boiled egg, ground pork, and who knows what.   I like BBQ pork buns steamed or baked...PERIOD.     I've had BBQ pork buns in 17 different countries and I think the ones in San Francisco are the best of all the Cha Siu Bao I've ever munched.    I spell your "Char" as "Cha" because that how It's pronounced where I was born...the most Northern part of Southern China.   It snows there in winter.   Can you guess where that is?  .
U R SO CUTE AND FUNNY! Love the presentation!        Enjoy ur humility! And thank you Chef John.  <3 <3 <3   :-))))))
Thank you  thank you thank you soooo much for the recipe I will cook it with beef or lamb
I love watching your channel, you are direct, funny and keep things simple.
news narrator mam
hmm mon chat a bien aimé
Great recipe, but do you really talk like that?
Omggg!!!!! I love your voice, make me laugh so hard how you narrated your recipe... because this is me every first time on everything ☺️🤣😂😎
Keep the great work up!
Hate how you talking
I love this! Your voice makes me happy!
I have to wonder if this guy talks like this in real life lol
traditionally (in any yeast dough), sugar is added to the water before the yeast is added.  this gives the yeast "food" to help it bloom.
I know this is not that related to the fantastic food content of the channel, but am I the only one who notices the change in speaking cadence, from Cheif John. Where he repeatedly accentuates the beginning of each sentence and quiets down at the end of the same sentence. And keeps repeating the same speech pattern throughout the entire video. It sounds very artificial, and you can notice it by comparing his speech pattern from this year, to any of his earlier videos, from 2013 for example where he speaks naturally. I honestly don't mind. But it is quite jarring when you compare the two ways of how different he presents and speaks in his videos, now to the way it was before. Strange I never see anyone mentions this, so I felt compelled to. Nothing against this fantastic channel ^_^ It is still my fave cooking chief/you tuber, for my home recipe ideas :3  Compare the speech pattern with this video as an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_HMX1SuW28
My anaconda don't want none unless you got..... Oh look you got buns... How nice...
Oh my gosh he cracks me up !! “I don’t mind off white.”
You should go you will enjoy it. My husband surprised me with a fabric buying trip. The hotel was a dream! I did not want to leave we were so pampered. I tried this and I could not get pass the dough but I will try your recipe.
John you lost weight
Can I use some Pillsbury Crescent Roll dough from a can for this?  Probably not, but I'm gonna try it anyway....
AWESOME, YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!
Did this recipe make anyone else think of Firefly?
His lilting voice is so weirdly soothing?
Somehoowww! Somewaay! Which Disney song is John's dough aspirations from?! I forget!
#KungFuPanda
Chef John you are so funny! Your videos make me smile and feel good. Thanks for always being such a pleasure to watch. Love from FL
No offense to you but everything you say when you end your sentences sounds like your going to say something else and I love it
You did well, Chef! Not many people, even Asians, can do siu bao/siopao. Try making a mixture of hoisin sauce, soy sauce, and a bit of brown sugar for the sauce next time. It’ll make a whole lot of difference! And twisting the dough tips in the end will help seal the bao. ❤️
who dislikes this?
Tao sa bao is better.
Haven’t been on the channel in awhile. So you no longer give the measurements??? Seriously....
Bro.... Why are you exaggerating EVERY DAMN SENTENCE!!!...
Super random, but your arms and hands look thinner....
Asexperiecedas I Am.... Why does he sound like that
https://youtu.be/kGnVcmrSKHE
Try adding some milk for the dough, it’ll make them fluffier.  Love your videos and puns!
Хинкали?
Your dough was a tad dry and the edges were too thick. Your bottom was great, you could have even made the bottoms thicker. They turned out good even with the dough issues. ^^
Steamed is good but baked is my favorite.
When I was in high school we had a little grocery store about 100yds away owned by an Asian family. it was always a race to get to there first at lunch to get in line for pork buns they made them bigger, about what would equate to a regular ham or turkey sandwich, and they were always sooo good. It was a shame because middle of my jr year the health department said they couldn’t sell them anymore because they didn’t have a kitchen in the store, they made them at home and brought them in every day and apparently you need some special license to make food in your own kitchen to sell.
Hmm Steamed Hams
Chef you should check out an Indian rice flour dumpling recipe called modak. I think you’d like them!
I loved looking at Chef John’s buns
Why the extra time and steps to have to look into another source for the measurements? Why not simply include them with the video?
“Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway....”
I'm bad at making dough. Really bad. And it consumes a lot of time.   But it tastes so much better compared to store bought dough...
Pinchin' and a pleatin' . 😊
So its like a sandwich but takes a lot longer to make?
Looks great! Tip for those that want to make these.. Make the center thicker than the edges (and the edges thinner than what Chef John did).  It will make closing and doing the pleats a bit easier.
I would love some more recipes for dipping sauces for buns and dumplings
Your meant to use rice flour mixed with plain flour....
If anybody finds the recipe for Manapua meat filling, please link.
Now I'm craving Manapua but I don't live in Hawaii anymore. F*ck my life.
The last word he says in every sentences has the same sound or pitch or like a certain uhhh u know what just listen
I only got halfway through before the supid way you're talking got to me.
This voice overs are hte best, I am secretly in love with this man. Hahah you always make my da!
Can I use rice flour?
Got a batch of dough rising, and my filling is ready to go (I pulled, minced and sauced some meat from leftover slo-cooked spare ribs). Woo hoo ... fresh bao for lunch. My first attempt at bao btw .... ive done plenty of dumplibgs, but never bao.  Thanks Chef John.
Love watching your videos!
Pork 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
This waS A REALLY GOod videooo.
Ok so as I've discovered, The Char Siu bao sauce is actually not char siu sauce...the reason being is cause the meat is char siu, but the sauce around it is some ultra hard wierd sauce
Is it wrong for me to want Chef John to shit in my mouth?
Do vegans eat yeast?
I've loved bao for about 25 years, but I falsely assumed that they were made from rice flour.  Thanks for the tutorial!!
What is it with this guy's yoyo voice?
Bahahaha this is cute
Why do you start off high in octive then get low in every damn sentence, I like the recipies but I can't stand your freaking voice
Shaggy “doe”
"I'm kinda off white". I​ love his random comedy
Pinchin and a pleating!
We are the Mao of our Bao! Wonderful vids Mr. John, thanks for all of your hard work and insight.
In Chinese we call these baozi! They're pretty popular in China, but I think steamed/boiled dumplings are more common. Char Siu actually isn't the most traditional/popular filling, just the one you see most often at dim sum (which is how it got so well-known). The most traditional is probably pork and leek, which is super delicious. There's no wrong filling, but most baozi are actually much more savory than Char Siu Bao, which are sweet because of the marinade/gravy used to cook the pork.   On a side note, I can't believe you've never visited China! It's a food lover's dream. China has so many different types of regional cuisines, and while SF Chinatown has some great food, it will never be an accurate representation of the insane diversity and rich history of Chinese food. I highly recommend to anyone who likes food, visit Beijing or Shanghai and find a local willing to show you around. It really is worth the trip.
Those look better than the «authentic» ones, which have too much doughy dough & not enough meat.
Can u do ramen?
Could you make soup dumplings
friendly
Please do a part 2 where you make baked bbq pork buns too.
Why does he sound like hes asking a question after each sentence.
You're the Hu Jintao of your cha siu bao.
"And it really is a great technique to use up some leftover meat..."  What, pray tell, is leftover meat?  That never happens in my house.  It's like saying "leftover pie" or "leftover ice cream."  And the more savory approach is a Vietnamese-style bao... which is generally spicier than chinese style (as made in the USA, of course).
A tip: If you want to give your BBQ pork an extra Char Siu kick to it: Substitute some of the Hoisin for some chinese cooking wine. It really works a treat when stuffing your buns! :)
Could I used minced pork/beef in these? If so should I cook the meat prior to steaming?
Love "The ole poka poka"
This reminds me of Filipino Siopao.
Chef john, have my babies
When I worked at a vet hospital in San Francisco, one of our clients would bring us like two dozen pork buns once or twice I week. Pretty sure I gained 20lbs. I would tell people "this is my pork bun weight"
*Kungfu panda Po’s mouth is watering*
I planned to add some pink elements like the nipples of venus but I couldn't found food colour in the grocery. So sad! They dimmed my inspiration.
Thank you for these beautiful videos and very useful and I wish to activate the translation system for other languages ​​and special Arabic language .. Thank you
This actually makes me want to try to make these but I have never tried them before
I'm surprised you didn't make a joke about a Shaggy dough... Scooby awaits. Not sure it's possible to make a pun on that, though.
Is there a gluten free way to make this dough?
Baozi! Mmmmm. If you want to make the pleats look all proper, you hold the previous pleats against your thumb and pull the next pleat into them. Otherwise they look fine and doesn't change the taste if they aren't perfect. Good one as always.
Green onions are spring onions not scallions =/ LUL
Bao! Bao! Bao! (in my waka flocka voice)
I clicked on this and read the title and both my stomach and mind screamed in pure agnoy because I'm in bed already in hungry
Do you have a cook book?
"i'm kind of off white" HAHAAHA
We call this a #Manapua in Hawaii. One of my favorites 💖
I feel like making this but putting sloppy joe inside instead of BBQ pork  🤷🏽‍♀️
Chef John, you are officially the best cooking channel on the internet. You make life seem ok. I love you.
i would use maple syrup to make the pork more sweet and on point..
Can you please do your take on Chicken Adobo??
Thanks for the video. Can you make another one for dipping sauce?
OH SHIT IN FROM CHINA AND WHEN I SAW THIS I SCREAMED A BIT THANK YOU CHEF JOHN
This is the best food channel on Youtube PERIOD. Also the only channel where you laugh and learn about food at the same time.
Beat Babish to the Bao, huh Bjohn?
Takes me back to my days working in S.F. and having lunch at the amazing Chinatown dim sum places. You're the best, Chef John. And let me add my food wish again, it's been a few years. Can you consider some kind of buckwheat crepe with a mushroom and gruyere filling? Maybe you hate crepes, and maybe you hate buckwheat, but hey, maybe you don't and I'll get my wish!
Chef, can you do a rabbit dish please? We would be the hopper to your rabbit topper.
Absolutely cracking up at your pleating. Good to see the holey spatula.
Can you do Pastéis de Belém?
love a good shagged dough
Can I bake these instead of steaming them?
Please make a video on how to do tater tots. PLEASE!!!
im a Chinese, I got it wrong, man
Why are they flat, Chef John? :D
You are hilarious!
make muslim bean  pie. please
Chef John hasn't uploaded in  while, is everything okay?
Was wondering why you haven't put out a new video in a week so I went and looked at your Twitter.... wow, never knew you were a vehement anti-Trumper. Guess this is another Youtube channel that will NOT be looking at from now on. Good luck with your hate.
Chef John.  Bavette.  Grilling season 2018 needs a superstar.
Chef John I love your videos so much! And I literally learned how to cook from you! Thank you for being so good at what you do and being so entertaining and funny!
Has anyone ever even experience dead yeast?
I’m not sure if you have already done so, but could you show how to make a great tasting mantou?
I missed this video, Sorry Chef, Your food is glorious, keep up the Great work.
I wish sports were narrated with your voice!
Um ... yeah. This is awkward. We don't care if you're on "vacation". We still expect our awesome videos. :D
Dear Chef John, I have taken it upon myself to notice that you haven't uploaded in a week. Me and my girlfriend are hoping that everything is well with you and that you are doing great.
Hi chef was hoping maybe you can make a Croatian dish in celebration of them making it to the world cup final (kind of like when you did the Superbowl themed dishes)
Can you imagine accidentally bumping into someone at your local food market and they apologize to you with his voice
Hi Chef John, please make this recipe in English. It looks amazing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThSE_9KFlaI
I love your video so much . you are funniest cook in the world!!!
i really love your videos.  i was pretty sick for a few months and couldn't eat--like, anything.  but watching your videos has helped me regain some of my appetite and enabled me to actually put food in my mouth, which i hadn't done in a long while.  so thank you so very very much for helping me.  now, all i have to do is gain the 50 lbs back that i lost.....  but i have hope that that will happen!  thanks again!
GREAT on everything... except the filling. If I could revive my auntie, she'd show you.
The way this guy talks cracks me the fuck up
The way this guy talks cracks me the fuck up
the filling is not up to you, that is a tradition which you fucked up big time
please do your pasta dish, and your chinese boa is AWFUL !!!!!
Dude I did a very odd take on this after I watched. Doughs the same, however for the filling I used some leftover pork roast that I baked in sauerkraut, some of the sauerkraut, and I caramelized some onions and added some bacon. As you can guess, it did turn out a little too moist but using a thicker layer of dough completely counteracted that. It was almost like a soup dumpling.
Delicious buns 👍🏻
Dakotaz anyone?
Dakotaz?
Chef John I just wanna say thanks for your videos.i love to Cook. And have since I was 10. Wich isn't that long im only 17....I only really cooked simple things and recipes that my family taught me. Until I found your channel. No I cook things from all over the world. Instead of American southern food. And to me that's cool. That there are different foods that are no where near the same to where im from. You've inspired me. I have cooked so many amazing things in the past year. And that's because of you. I am I high school drop out. But yove inspired me so much to the point im getting my GED and going to apply for culinary school. And im going to follow my dream and hopefully cook in every corner of the golbe. .... Thank you.
Happy birthday Chef John!!!
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
A man who never eats a pork bun is never a whole man
so much inflection in your voice like austin evans
Damn, love his vocal inflections
Eating technique:  bao in left hand, bottle of Sriracha in right hand.  The first bite is pristine; thereafter, apply a squirt of Sriracha to the about-to-be-bitten portion.  Trust me on this.
This is one of the things I've missed most about Seattle! Going to have to give these a try soon. Thanks!
I am now hungry for Pork Buns! I love the video!
Hey Chef. I know it's overrated, and I sure you're against it, but could you make just 1 video that's Keto or very low carb?   Hope you're enjoying your vacation.
I never make the same fillings either but was happy to get the dough recipe. Will try this. Bao bao 4 now
Hey, Chef John!  Can this dough be given a pretzel bath and then baked?  I was thinking a barbecue and beer cheese pretzel bao sounds like something I'd like to experiment with.
Chef John, please watch Mike Chen's bao video. He teaches how to wrap them in the proper and  beautiful way. Highly recommend! https://youtu.be/qvOBLYVWPYY
I wonder why didn't you make a real char siu sauce for the meat. It is simple and so much worth it!   Still, really cool seing you making this amazing dish!
Can you do a video on sesame balls?  Pleeeaaassse?
Hi John can you do an Rome cacio e Pepe pasta dish pleeeeese
I remember Chinese people in Iowa using the pre-made biscuit dough in those pop-open containers to make boa zip. Seems like travesty but ... when a person needs boa zi ...
https://youtu.be/Q0w_uSTPuqQ
I am now ready to be a whole man
I've always used ad-block, but your videos are a special exception.
Chef John I love you
❤️🤯❤️
Someone saw incredibles 2    Should have dropped hints
I just can't get over his diction. Am I alone in this? Please vote. Maybe he tries and works on it. Reminds of Austin Evans. Please sir please I beg you just think about it.
The inflection in the way he speaks drives me nuts. 🤪
“A man who never eats pork buns, is never a whole man!”
you didn't say "round the outside" :( :( :( :(
Chef John! ... please do a "Hot Brown" recipe!!!!
Finally something simpel I can make with ingredients I can find easily... love you uncle Jon
Shouldn't those buns have a  noodly texture to it? Now i'm confuesd for all my life...
As a young chief I love these videos  But as a gamer, does any one know how this guys voice sounds like direwolf20? I can't get that thought out of my head. I just simply can't
Its very helping me thankyouu❤
guys eat alot of pineapple in SF. Thats why it tastes sweeter to you Chef John.. lol
And as all wees, enjoi!
You are hilarious lmao
May I suggest a recipe. I’d like for you to make Beehive dessert, or it could be also called honeycombs
Mmmmm, steamed hams
Chinese BBQ pork next?
Hey chef john! You should make oyakodon sometime!
Holy shit! I was actually craving those! today I even bought the dried mushrooms :D
Daehan All Purpose Flour is excellent for this.  It's the Korean-brand flour with the polar bear.
Itadakimasu..
best food ever
▓▒░  What  a  coincidence.  I  ate  this  just  yesterday,  July  06th,  2018. `  Here  in  Malaysia,  they're  called  Char  Siew  Pau.  ░▒▓ `
This is called Pau. Yeah...
In Filipino,it's called as "Siopao".
"leftover meat" There is no such thing.
His voice is almost as bad as CHILLS .. lol but good recipe tho
Love the content, but man o man, change the way you voice over your videos. I can't finish the videos.
Please make pani puri 😍😍
Is it just me or did chef John lose weight:
The most awkward rolling technique with the strangest narration voice ever 5:16!! oh and traditionally "they" use a thinner rolling pin. Who is they? If that is you in the thumbnail I totally understand this video and the rest. IMO SMH!!
Dear chef John, can you make more vegan/vegetarian recipes? Thank you! ❤️
How about doing sfogliatelle? Thanks for the fantastic channel. 👍👍👍
i always wanted to make these. the timing is just right. thanks chef
Chef John do you spy on my youtube search patterns to know what video to do next?  Thank you for the upload , this is the 3rd item I search that you post not long after.  I am definitely going to try this one since I do happen to have some smoked pulled pork lying around, even after the pulled pork nacho's and the pulled pork poutine we had this week. (please no comments on the healthiness of my meals,  at least everything is homemade!)
Wait, Vegetable Oil and not Sesame Oil?  Shame on you.
We gave it a go with some adjustments for the filling - works perfectly. Just as good as the stores.
I'm confused??? In the video "getting to know john from food wishes" (hungry nation) he talks normal and he is not the guy in he's YouTube icon
My good man, the secret to the dough is cornstarch.
They call those '' Salapa '' in Thailand
Turned out really well. I have made them a few times and I know the struggle. I think you need a dipping sauce though, but that is just me.
Hey!!!! You should make a French onion dip!!!! I have to take that, guac, and salsa to a party next weekend and I’m the crazy lady who’s going to make them all from scratch! So honestly if you want to make all three in one video that’s awesome... for... Labor Day? I was just looking for recipes and was shocked you don’t have one for it!!
Why do you talk like you just learned english
Thumbs up for effort! I agree that food doesn't have to look good to taste good!!!!
do you have a baked pork bun recipe?
After watching chef John’s awkward folding technique.  I am now 100% sure I can make this 😉. Thank you chef.
The highs and lows in your tone slays me!
You should try them with carnitas instead of pulled pork...they taste pretty good!!
Would you cook a dish from Dominican Republic? You've got a small but solid fanbase here!
Delicious! Wow, my mouth is watering, but I dread not having the time to cook like this! Thanks!
Chef John, I looked for your video on making Miso Soup, but you don't have one. Can you help me with my food wish?
Oh. My. Gawd...  PLEASE show us how to make big soup dumplings!
Food Wish: ... Totally craving something with gnocchi <3
My mom adds milk sometimes to get that whiteness and more richness in the dough
The protip if you don't want to bother looking for that Chinese dumpling flour is to add some turmeric into your dough. Then "but why isn't it white" turns into "it's yellow because of the turmeric". Other colors work nicely too, like green for instance. This is especially useful if you're making them with different fillings, you can color code which one is which, and for none of them will it be obvious that the color isn't white because you just couldn't be bothered with that flour.
For those who don’t know, “bao” means “bun” and “char siu” means “pork” :) great recipe Chef John!
I made these often at Bonefish Grill when their menu was all over the place.
NICE BUNS!!
Yay, captioning! Thank you for those. I really appreciate them. <3   I can't wait to try these!  Steaming food is much nicer than turning on the oven in the heat of the summer.
OMG! Chef John and my favorite foodchoice <3 wonderful!
awesome! do you think it would work better if you used a ramen noodle dough recipe instead? I am so making these, big chief. thanks so much for the inspiration.
After binge watching some videos... it looks like the dough wasn't thin enough. You want to press harder around the edges so you can pleat the edges but not build up a big clump of dough.
steamed pork buns are like perfection. sweet and savory with great protein to carb ratio for breakfast mmm.
Too much work.
Don't have any pork but I do have 5 kilos of grilled chicken....
What if your Shaggy dough looks more like a Scooby dough is it still okay to use...?
Great video Chef John! You are the ruler-wielding nun, of your steamed BBQ pork bun!  Question - Do you have a go to bao in San Francisco? I’ve had them in the Ferry Building and also from a few bakeries in Chinatown. Wondering if you had any awesome recommendations.
Steaming is a horrible crime against dough. :(
Look nice and have smooth surface. That's important. But if you wanna have achieve white dough, just use high protein flour, or use flour whitening powder. Overall, it's okay. props to you, chef! But if I'm allow to make 1 tiny recommendation, the bun should be sealed all the way with no hole at all as to avoid the filling to burst. Talking from experience here.
If my bao smells very alcoholic when I bite into it does that just mean I've let it rise for too long?
How the Fuck are you speaking the last words in your sentences are so annoying
Hi Chef John! You can actually help the white colour with a little bit of vinegar, like rice wine would be a good choice
We call these "manapua" in Hawaii. It's the shit!
Chef John... ain't nobody got time for that!
Siopao!
There's another version of this with sweet bean paste. Can you do one video on that? Or maybe just a blog post?
I started to buy those because I thought the bun wasn't made of flour,so it's not that healthy,I guess is the same thing like eating a regular sandwich,you're eating bread and meat. I'm disappointed now.
Yum! I would love to see your take on red bean buns!!!!
have you ever had a dead yeast package?
About the snowy whiteness, my grandpa once told me that you add a splash of white vinegar into the steaming water and they turn out brighter. I've never tried it but you could test it out?
This looks like a bit of a fail, dough is too yellow, doesn’t look fluffy and needs several more ingredients to be super fluffy like restaurant Char Siu Bao. You need to add wheat starch and change the vegetable oil to shortening and Hong Kong style flour
Yasss thank you for making these, these are the best
Oh my gosh why does your voice go up in every phrase you say. I can’t omg
Where ya been ?
You know the world is ending when Chef John DOESN'T use cayenne in a recipe (not that using the spice is a bad thing).  :)
I used cake flour to make bao before,  they looked white.
I made bao just last thursday, but not your recipe of course so I think I'll have to make them again (: Thank you Chef John for all these amazing recipe videos, they're my favorite to watch, especially when I'm in need of some inspiration for dinner.
Lol
Thank you much^__^:)*
MANAPUA! I live in Hawaii but am currently on the mainland and was just telling people about these who didn’t know.. I must make them for everyone now that I have a recipe!
A MAN WHO NEVER EATS PORK BUNS IS NEVER A WHOLE MAN
the hardest part of making bao is folding/wrapping them
Have to watch these on mute. The voice inflection is just way over the top.
finally!
Very good job, Chef John. I actually prefer the thinner dough method. BTW, you should try making the BAKED version. That not only tastes great but also travels and reheats well.
You can't call these Char Siu Bao in your title and then use American BBQ meat.
does that mean you're going to make Chinese dimsum steamed shumai?
A man who never eats pork buns is never a whole man!
Does anyone else find the way he finishes his sentences really off putting?
JUST SPEAK NORMALLY.
i love your humor Chef John!!! you had me cracking up! and thanks for this recipe, i grew up eating char siu baos.
Will one come to life?
CHEF I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ONE I LOVE YOU !!!!!!
Chef John is like Bob Ross, but in the kitchen. "There are no mistakes, only happy accidents"
Wow chef John!!!! 你做了包子！！！！！！！
A slight abomination.
☝️I want ten of those, check please
I think cabbage and shredded carrot would have been nice additions
HONEY HONEY IT NEEEEEEDS HONEY IN THE MIX...  TRUST ME ;) ;) ;)
YEAH!!!, i requested this a while ago!
I love it so much! Very easy to follow and I’m excited to try it myself, but the tone and pitch of his voice follows the exact pattern and trajectory over and over, which from a listeners perspective is quite distracting. Just try to be more casual and ordinary with the narration and the video would be about perfect.
Make some dumplings too and I will teach you how to fold and wrap them! ;)
The constant backtracking is adorable! It's a really encouraging thing for aspiring cooks to see that apparent failures during the process can still have fantastic results so you've got to persevere and trust your instincts sometimes.
I know Chef John doesn’t have time to answer, but someone tell me if they think that freezing these things would work. I’m sure they won’t be as fresh, but I’d love to make a bunch of these for a party at a later time.
I learned what these were from The Food Ranger!  They look so good and very similar to the ones he shows over there.  Good stuff !
You are after all the Attila the Hun of your steamed pork bun.
this was kinda boring
It looks like you lost some weight! Good on you.
ohh those look great!
Chef John are you losing weight? Your arms look kinda slim. ;)
You are one our inspirations!
It's like Japanese and American at the same time it's like freedom in a bun
Scooby dough might have worked better
how did the dough turn out the following day?
2:37 Chef why not refer to your old recipe of Char Siu here? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT7dUC-8PR0
Looks delicious as always Chef John, could they be filled with different meats? I cant have pork for religious reasons.
I'll be honest chef john, I hate this strategy of yours that dilutes, bastardizes traditional dishes just so some idiot in Arkansas who is too stupid or lazy to order off of amazon can make something that resembles visually, but is actually very far from a traditional dish. Why do this? This sort of interpretation of a dish that has been evolving in a loose cultural bubble doesn't help our world. It doesn't help that we now have a dumbed down pulled pork and hoisin sauce steamed bun. The world is quite literally a better place if we had another video demonstrating how to make a real char siu bao, and worse in a world where people make videos of knock-offs. Imagine we lived in a world where every woman could have a Prada bag, and there was really something special about the craftsmanship and aesthetic that was undisputed. All one need to do, is go to a store, and get the materials, and it was a simple matter of assembly. Now imagine some dude in Burma was just like .... "I'll just release the formula for a Preda bag." "It's not a Prada bag at all if you're seriously inspecting it, it would only satisfy a person who was completely ignorant(which means to say these people really don't know what they're missing, and that's a bad thing). Would we want to live in a world where people needlessly made inferior replicas? I don't think so. I just can't imagine how this helps. Just go to a Channel like Chinese Cooking Demystified and do the real thing. We live in 2018. You can get everything off of amazon. Why half ass something like this... It makes no sense for anyone who is passionate about food. Are your sure your incentives are in the right place when you make videos like these, Chef?
I think they look pretty darn good.
Hello! My name's NNNIIIINNNNNOOOOO!!!!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOBLYVWPYY  I wish you would´ve like to at least see you giving a shoutout to him for his video.
Can't believe food wishes will make Chinese food like叉燒包
I'm off-white too, brother.
You missed a chance to say "around the outside, around the outside, around the outside"!  I am disappoint. Great video, though!
you always make me smile with your videos. Thank you :)
is that intonation on purpose?
I’m not lying I made these as soon as I saw the vid and they were amazing
I want to watch more of your videos because your stuff is great but me and my fiancé can not stand the way you talk up and down up and down your voice is so annoying !!!!!
I'm going to fill mine with chicken alfredo
Egg foo young!
Thank you! The professionals make this look extremely difficult to make "right"! But you're a professional that finally made it look not difficult at all and it still looks right! <3 Thanks Chef!
My neon green San Francisco Chinatown sweater looks so much more authentic after this XD
What about the experiment?  We demand the result.
1:22 *Binging With Babish?!*
Adding a little bit of vinegar can help to keep the buns a little whiter. Not as white as that special Chinese dumpling flour, but it's noticeably lighter.
This video came out literally an hour after I got done making a batch of pork bao! Iused a recipe by the creator of the Pixar short "Bao". That short really help me pick up the folding technique!
GO watch Maangchi's video on Jjinppgang-Mandu buns and learn how to pleat
In Mexico, we use a trick by taking a coin and placing it in with the boiling water. As the water comes to the boil, the coin will start to "tick". If extended periods of steaming are involved as in tamal making, the tick lets you know that water is still in the boiler. Should the ticking stop, check your water level. Just a helpful tip. Great recipe, Chef!
Ohhh so this is like a siopao
Looks lovely! I'm alwayss disappointed when I get a bun because it's always too bread-y. More fill, less bread!
somebody just watched Incredibles 2. And those were not tears in his eyes after watching the short. That was just excess humidity that had accumulated around his eyes.
Incredibles 2?
Who has left over ribs!?  Hasn’t a night passed since the cook-out?  That’s middle of the night food!
You did a really good job, but...at the same time, you also live in San Francisco. Just hop on down to Clement st., Chef John.
Oh yeaaaahhh.... de bao bao... chicka chicka
I just watched your Persian Rice video, and you should totally do Ghormeh Sabzi to go with it!
You should watch the video by strictly dumpling! He has a great folding techniqe instructions! And a really good recipe!
You are the Curtis Blow of your shaggy dough!
I'm going to cry. I've always wanted to learn how to make char siu bao. ❤️
Aww - it's just like the short before Incredibles!
Another wonderful video!! If you’re interested in a whiter appearance, use cassava flower!
A man who has never eaten pork bun is not a whole man!
John, You should move back to the east coast.
Can you Fry em?
*I suggested this!!!!!!!!*  (To be fair probably a lot of other people did too.)
I'm addicted to your channel! 💝Love your recipes and your sense of humor. 😀
traditionally, it's more savory than sweet, you got it right chef john, props to you :)
Not very authentic. The cha siu in real cha siu bao isn’t mixed with all that garbage. It’s just pure meat and goodness!
I'm seriously doubting the authenticity of this video. There's just no way the real chef John would have left over ribs.
I loved this video! I've been wanting to see a video or this fit a while. Thank you!
I love these bao too so thanks for the inspiration.  I would just go buy meat from Chinese restaurant.
It's estimated thatt 100 million Chinese were murdered and starved by their own government under the reign on Chairman Mao. He went on a decade long campaign to destroy Chinese tradition (artifacts, writings, buildings) in an attempt to make a "Great Leap Forward" . Look it up dumb fuck. A grim reminder of what fantastical, utopian dreams of a perfect society can produce.  Inappropriate use of a rhyme there chef, that's where I draw the line.
If it ain't white, it ain't right!
Hi Chef John.  You're so funny you should really do stand up comedy.
I love you chef John but no.... just......... no.........
I love you chef John but no.... just......... no.........
chef... you didn't go round the outside.... round the outside.... round the outside....
Fantastic, as usual. Really missed an amazing sauce to dip the bao.
I love char siu bao.  But I've always wondered how they'd fare if you replaced the BBQ pork filling with a thick custard or pastry cream.
But white sugar is poison.
Did you lose weight, chef?
deep fry those baozi john
"Leftover ribs"? What is this phrase? I've never heard of it before, it does not compute! It is illogical!!!
“I’m basically off white” 😂
Try some sweet soy sauce in the filling.
Fresh bao?  Quaint!
Oh chef John there’s a method to pleat & u gotta keep ur left thumb on the filling & pleat around in a circle against ur left thumb w ur right fingers (like your pie crust technique but with dif fingers). I think the ideal is to make 10 pleats and with the proper technique you can churn these tasty boys out no problem
Hey, I used to make these all the time in the past. Even I never used self-raising flour they always turned up pretty good. For the filling I used to put some thin beef strips in soya sauce for an hour or so in the fridge then finely chop some white onions, carrots and green onions put them on a skillet and then deglaze it with some fresh orange juice. It's pretty good with chicken too pretty sweet (if the oranges are not as sweet as you need them to be may use  1-2 tablespoons of honey). Then you cook some of them the way you show here and put the rest in the freezer. Then you can instantly use them whenever you want, you just add 5-10 minutes on cooking time on top of the initial one and you are golden. Cheers!
How do we know the dough has doubled in size?  It will be twice the size as it was before.
Good to see Chef John is abao that life!
My stomach don't want none unless you got buns hun. Pachow. Love you chef John. I would like to do the old poka poka on your cheeks. Lol
i think im gonna use your dough recipe, but the filling from another recipe i know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMYRjp4h0y0 - she's pretty awesome at the pleats. Maybe that'll help.
Good Job Chef John! Love your style, resilience..only stronger people admit any error or shortcoming in a piece of effort, and do the best anyway. Professional, nice way.
That's looks great
Great one chef 👨‍🍳But how did the other piece of dough turn out next day making more dumplings? Was it better? 🤔🤔🤔
Great, now I have to go to my favorite Chinese Bakery for steamed buns. You see what you did? Thank you.
Chef John, please make some momos 😋😋
Char Siu Bao looks stunning! 😍😍😍
You are the Adrienne Barbeau of your Char Siu Bao?
I read that the special bao flour is not just bleached it's also ground finer and has less gluten. So that effects the end result.
very pretty I'm going to steal this recipe.....
They look yummy.
Hi John, some tips. Less filling so the top can be completely sealed. It will help to keep the moisture. Since your dough is thinner, less minutes steaming because it looks like a bit overcooked. Or a ticker dough so you can obtain a must desired fluffy texture. But overall nice try on char siu buns!!!
It sure doesn't look like the traditional Char Siu Bao, but I  am betting yours to be a lot healthier Chef John.  Those bleached as white as snow bun flour from Mainland China(CCP) often contains shady unlisted ingredients that wrecks havoc to your health.
A man who never eats pork buns is never a whole man.
I got a free electric steamer, and the first thing I thought about making in it is bao. Since I've never had a bao of any type, I was clueless on how to make them...until now. Thanks, Chef John.
I imagine this could be outrageously good (and really Americanized, I know, it’s not authentic) with bbq sauce in it. You could get really creative with the fillings.
I'm so excited to try these with bacon jam as a filling
I haven't seen Incredibles 2. This made think of Kung Fu Panda! 😋
I use Pillsbury's Grand biscuit dough instead of making my own dough because I'm lazy.
I love giving meat pillows the old poke-a poke-a, what a perfect recipe!
I make the dough and I always get my wife to do everything else😂
Lol.. I laughed so much that I failed to pay attention to the recipe itself. Now have to watch again!
Thank you for not making a Scooby Doo joke
HOISIN means "seafood" in Cantonese, so basically its Chinese seafood sauce
"It was really soft and tight"  Oh really now sir! 😂
You're an odd fellow John but you steam a good bun.
If you don’t like your seams you can put them on the bottom and mark the top with a dot of food coloring. Yellow = Chicken, Purple = Pork, Red = Beef
What's the rationale behind using yeast in a self-rising flour? I was hoping it might have been in the blog post but I didn't see it there. Is it a textural thing, like using baked soda when you make ramen noodles?
We have many enterprising Chinese immigrants in Peru and 5hey sell these as street food. We call them min pau. They are sooo good! They usually come with a boiled quail egg inside along with the pork.
Who makes only three pork buns?
Noice!
This guys voice grates on me, great video though
How can I get a thiccer layer?
Hmmm interesting take! Savory char siu sounds pretty dope!
If you've ever wanted easy and delicious steamed bbq pork buns, baos your chance! 😉😉😘
i'd rather just buy them
Man who never eat pork bun, is never whole man.
Man without pork bun never a whole man
Kung-fu panda food!!😆😆😆😆😉😉😉😉😉😉😉
What's this leftover BBQ he talks about? I've never seen that.
Thanks Chef John, they look great.
I love pork buns and you made it look so easy. I will be trying this recipe even if I don't know how to cook 👍
Nahhh they look cute ☺
You say everything like a question
Chef john, i beg you to make a copycat of Tim Ho Wan’s baked bun with bbq pork. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Well sir my food wish is French snails 🐌 yum 😋
I want to sit on them! Lol
it is so funny to watch u pinched the buns....LOL we also have black sugar version of this kind of buns.... I love them so much..：P
I like chef John‘s way to fold the bao together, as I never can learn from my mom, her way is way to complicated, I want to see your recipe on fresh meat bao next time， please! 鲜肉包子！
how about tackling Xiao Long Bao?
A man who never eats Pork Buns is never a whole man!
Staining the dough....well say enhances the flavors
char siu already means bbq pork, so char siu pork is redundant, sorta like "chai tea" and "atm machine"
LOL looks good Chef.  Mine would not be white either but then I use blends with sprouted wheat flours, rye flours and other seed meals that  produce a much more robustly flavoured and coloured bread.
A shaggy dough, that is like a regular dough except it hangs around with Scooby and the Gang.
pretty sure authentic buns use alkaline water
Wow beautiful!
Brave thx
I’ve always wanted to make these!!!
food just does not taste good to me with my mouth on fire or I could just be a sissy boy that can't take the spice?
Very timely recipe
Chef John,  Your bao technique is just fine.   Most Asian housewives can't do as well.   Your bao look like the Vietnamese style not tall, but squat and smaller.   If you live near an Asian market you can buy the prepackaged dough flour mix in a bag for a little more than a dollar or so.  I buy it on sale for 99 cents so I stock up as they keep well.    Sometimes the instructions are in English.  If you get a bag of what you want, cut the English instructions out and save it as your next bag might not have English instructions.  In time you can make the dough blindfolded.    Bags of different dough flour mix for dumplings, Potstickers, Har Gow and other types of goodies are available too.  I actually have found 5 different kinds of dough flour mixes in my travels.  There may be even more.  One tip I got from a Taiwanese housewife was to use a combination of 1/2 water and 1/2 milk for your bao.  I liked the taste and texture better than with only water.   I think that's the Asian cooking tip that is the western equivalent tip of using a little water in your cake mix for a better texture.  Chef John should weigh in on that tip.    I always read as many of the comments I can.  Sometimes hundreds.   The funniest ones are the "Can I substitute this for that?".  Sure you can.  Be daring with your ingredients.  That's the fun of cooking!   Recipes like Waldorf Salad, Pears Helene, Shepards Pie and many others were invented out of not wanting to waste food in a home or a restaurant.    You should look in your refrigerator and see what main course and sides you can make out of all your leftovers.  Save money and invent your signature dish.   The takeaway from Chef John for me is technique.  With his Training & Experience in food preparation you might really learn something useful.    His videos on Turkish Delight and even Chinese scallion pancakes were very useful to me although I am quite proficient on those and many other recipes he has done videos on.  I learn something new and polish my old techniques on every cooking recipe Chef John does.  Thank you and God bless you Chef John.    .
Someone watched Incredibles 2
How do you know what I have been craving?
Chairman mao killed 50 million of his own people
Ugh I love your videos. Been watching for years. Don’t know if your bored or whatever. But this hi lo way your speaking is driving me nuts. I used to enjoy the info plus the great wit but not no mo. Thanks for all the great info throughout the years but I’m moving on
Will there ever be a fan meet up in SF? :D
What are left over ribs? I've never heard of such a thing.
No "round the outside, round the outside, round the outside"? Sad! ;)
Guess Chef John made it out to see The Incredibles 2?
while your closure technique may need some work (practise makes perfect!), the dough looks perfect!
"I don't mind the off-white...I'm kind of off-white."
A bit dry but The bun looks so cuteeeee ^^
After you bit into I thought...hmm homemade hot pockets.  Mmm
The Chairman Mao joke was hilarious.
When it's 12:00AM and you have nothing to eat....
A man who never eats pork buns is never a whole man.
rolling/pressing the dough out looks like a good job for a tortilla press
Oh yes! Im not mad any more about the Celery sorbet, this i like 🍙🍽🍽🍽🍙🍙
Please, please do a video on making the Chinese BBQ filling for these - I'd love to see your take on Char Siu.
Your recipe links don't seem to work.  I love steamed buns. I don't eat pork so I seldom get them in restaurants but this technique should work fine with chicken. Thanks!
Would love to see you make the curried beef buns that seem to only be available during Chinese New Year.
But WAIT did the dough do well on these the next day???
chowking pork shiopao / pork buns. u gotta try that in the philippines
I grew up eating these and survived college with char siu buns in my freezer lol.
3:36 did he just imply that we taste the meat when its raw
*A MAN WHO NEVER EATS PORK BUNS IS NEVER A WHOLE MAN*
Did chef John see Incredibles 2 and the Pixar short story before the movie about this food item.
Well Chef John, you're an odd fellow. But I must say, you steam a good ham!
You should check out Chinese Food Demystified for the full authentic recipe.
You should make Dim sum next :)
叉烧包
Cooking battle with maangchi? :O)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzG5CXE0hfo
Hi Chef John I really enjoyed this video!! Can you please cook more Asian foods!!! I am asian myself I love Asian food!!! 👍
You're a national treasure, chef. Nick cage may kidnapp you.
Do the baked versions next, you’ll probably like them more.
This seems to be a mix of 2 kinds of the mass-produced buns, the pork one (more densely packed meat with vegetables and no sauce, sometimes with a piece of egg in it), and the char siew one (reddish honey barbecue sauce with only meat and no vegetables). This would probably be something found in an expensive dim sum restaurant.
You actually add vinegar to the steaming liquid to keep it white
肉包子很好吃
Cha siu bao 叉烧包 not char, which means fried, as in char kwey teow.
How come mine sprouts a body and becomes a child I’m emotionally attached too?
If you use the word Bao, it would be chinese. So Char Siu wouldn’t apply. It would be Cha Sha Bao. However, I’m not sure what Char Siu is (maybe Japanese) and I don’t know Bao in any other languages
A Shaggy dough is just like a regular dough except it has a big dog that solves misteries?
in China, hoisin sauce is called haixianjiang
It's so coincidental that this just came out, I just finished David Chang's Netflix series Ugly Delicious which finishes on dumplings and stuffed dough foods. If you haven't seen it, I recommend. It's about food but mostly the culture around food that brings people together but also keeps cuisines apart.
Sir, i admire ur enthusiasm of making this bun even though u r learning of doing it👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
PLZZZZZ  find a way to grill a frozen chicken breast. You have no idea how many times I get stuck with an unfrozen one
OMG I've been waiting for this video and didn't even know it
Can you teach us how to make Dim Sum?
Interesting. Not the typical way to make this but I'll have to try this and see how it compares. Not always do I want to get sourdough starter to make this traditionally so this seems like a much simpler alternative rendition.
The filling is not cardboard. That ain't traditional.
Can you make this same dough but make a red bean paste?! I’d love to see Chef Johns take on steamed red bean buns!
These are really fun to make. Yours look a bit better than mine did. But I will continue working on it. They are great for picnics and going to parades as they travel well.
Literally food from the heavens
I got my final 7 30 am tomorrow, but probably learn how to make steamed buns is more important now.
Test ya skills, make soup dumplings chef!
Siopao is really popular here in the Philippines. I'm definitely making this every chance I have
I just gotta say I love you so much
I can't wait to try this recipe! 😍
Too many things to mention got you my subscription and like, but your honesty got my loyalty. LOL!
ohhhh, yummy! it's BAO time you made these buns!
siopao ^o^
Porky goodness in a bun format. Those do look really top notch.
Chairman maObama .. hehe
This looks so wrong but so cute omg.
I swear that one looked just like Chairman Mao likeness.How'd you do that? XO
Yesssss do more of this
Great looking recipe, but, not gonna lie, kinda dissappointed that you skipped on the opportunity to do the 'Round the outside, round the outside' thing here...
I've got one, Chef John. How about AMISH style Chicken & Waffles?
I too am off white
Shaggy dough!!!!!!!! Oh my. This was the perfect end to my day
Thankfully when I moved back to the US from Southeast Asia, I ended up relocating to Southern CA & was easily able to find some of my favorite Asian dishes like these steamed pork buns (soft, lightly sweetened & fluffy) which I believe were referred to as "Siopao" in Hong Kong???  Thanks, Chef John for reminding me how easy these are to make at home!!! It's been awhile so I'm inspired to make my next batch...(with Carne Asado)  Plus, I'm anxious to use my new French rolling pin...HaHa
You are the chef john of your steamed bun
My absolute favorite thing to snack on since I was a kid. I grew up eating the baked ones more so than the steamed, but I still love them both and as such will make these very soon. If you have the chance, and haven't already, you should check out Wing Lee Bakery on the corner of 6th and Clement. My favorite spot for Char Siu Bao. On a side note: I read this comment back to myself out loud and subconsciously did so using the same mannerisms and inflections as you lol
You are, after all, the Attila the Hun of your Steamed Pork Buns.
Yummy
I see Chef John saw Incredibles 2😂
Good job! My wife makes these for me all the time. Same steamer. 😃
Hmmm this is one recipe that actually doesn't need the signature cayenne pepper
delightfully devilish
Last time I was in Korea I had some that were kinda erotica in their presentation. My colleagues also made comments on how full and soft they were. It brought a whole new meaning to food porn for me. Some things can never be unseen.
Ironically, hoisin sauce translated from Chinese is "seafood sauce"
Request: veggie pork buns
Oh my gosh! I suggested this! Thank you SO MUCH for making these! I can't wait to try them. I may also want to bake them (after trying them steamed, of course).
A question: Could I use a cabbage leaf under the buns as opposed to the paper?
...because you are the New York Villain of your pork bun fillin! ;]
Looks delicious! Just keep practicing the pinching technique 😁. I wonder what else makes a good filling in the dumplings 🙃
I used to get awesome hum baos in Seattle from an Asian market. They were so good.
Yeah I've always had them with a thicker dough but I much prefer the look of these - more bang for your buck!
Did you see pitmasterx did this? He's are legit as you!!
Looks like a siopao
Yeast and self rising flour?
Aloha ~ man do I miss these. Every 711 and Menehuni market in the islands sells these... right next to the spam musubi 🤙
hmmm did you watch incredibles 2? 😂
Thanks! I've always wanted to make these and never knew it was this simple.
Can I replace pork with chicken?
They look like mad babies.
Chef John wins the self contempt award of the day! lol
饿了。。。
in vietnamese banh bao xa xiu
No joke there were the next thing I was planning to make and now there’s a video the same day.
A man who never eat pork bun is never a whole man!
good job, now do soup dumplings!
I think if you use a ramekin and put plastic wrap in it. Them put the disk on the wrap followed by adding the filling.  Then pull the edges of the plastic wrap ..  you should get good shape of a bunn..
Add something like chicken/pork demi-glace and you will get a much, much juicier bun! I think the authentic one has quiet thin bread, and the dough tastes much fluffier, and a lot less chewy compared to the one I tried with all purpose flour. Not sure how they did that. :( My guess is they use low gluten flour. I will spy one of the restaurant and tell you their secret one day.
Nothing better than piping hot bao
I might be wrong, but aren't bao usually made with rice flour?
You shave your forearms and knuckles don't ya Chef John?  : )
Chef John you never disappoint me, that's the second time I'm thinking about trying a new recipe and out of a sudden you post a video of the one I had in mind.
Lmaoooo “I’m kinda off white” as a Chinese person I approve! :)
I wish you would have made some with your Korean rack of lamb meat.
Where in SF are you finding these Bao? I'm a big fan but don't know where to look!
This is what I like most about you Chef John, you inspire courage when you're willing to be vulnerable in your videos in admitting you're not an expert on these but giving them a shot anyway. And they looked great so now I the layman feel empowered to give this recipe a shot.
OMG.  YES!
Well done chef! 👍
You gotta show us how to make the sweet buns like you get at the Mongolian BBQ's, man. I need it!
Have you lost weight? Your hands and arms look thinner.
Ah, steamed pork buns (baozi) -- my favorite dim sum munchie ! There are never too many baozi.
is shaggys cousin shiggy lmao
Yesssss! I’m so excited!!! ^_^ <3
Chairman Wow! That's sum bao 👍
Dat shaggy dough
Good lookin buns you got there, Chef.   I bet you get that a lot.
Nice buns dude, no homo. ok, maybe a little.
Chef John I'm your Chinese fan!!! I knew I'll stick to my stuffing recipe and my "pinching" technique, before I even clicked on the notification hahaha. But I did click on it because I also knew I'd love your video and wouldn't feel offended at all!
A lot of chinese places just use white food coloring for the dough. Just saying.
p.s. i feel like your wrists look different. did you lose some weight, Chef John?
Mmmmmmm meat marshmallows !!
Please do Chinese soup dumplings
my FAVORITE. i used to make late night trips to Mott St in NY to get my Bao fix
Oh my goodness I really want to make these... I love bbq pork buns.
I know I’m not the only one that says “Hello this is chef John from Food Wishes. Com wiitthh...” 😂
“ Actually I’m kinda off white”.. that made me do a really loud obnoxious laugh. Don’t ask why
Mmmhmmm steamed hams
Chef John what is your favorite place in the Bay Area for dim sum? I visit the San Francisco, and Oakland/Alameda often. I would like a recommendation.
Now you don't have to go to the mall, to get a splendid meat filled ball.
"I'm kind of off-white" - Chef John LOL this had me in tears.
could you bake these?
maybe some soy sauce?
You are the Tommy gun of your steam bun, and a little rebelliousness never a bad thing.
I've been looking for a professional syle video on these for so long.. thank you so much!!!
Hi Chef John! I can't seem to find your recipe anywhere, would you mind telling me the website link?
My, what soft buns you have Chef John. 😍
nah.  i'll go to dragon beaux.
Chef John! Could you do soup dumplings?? I had them for the first time three years ago in Melbourne, it was also the last time I had them and it's very upsetting. Unfortunately I have never been able to find anywhere near where I live to get them. So I think I'm going to have to resort to making them myself, wanna help?! Hahah
I love your channel chef john!
I found that buying yeast in a large container gave me poor results, as if opening the dry yeast killed it over time. I'm going back to the single use packs.
woah
The Mao reference lacks taste.
Be careful, if you leave them out too long they'll come to life and then break your heart by trying gain independence
Souped Up Recipes has a great Char Siu Bao recipe that is truly authentic.  This is a good vid, too.  Love Chef John!
The best😂🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
You’ve got some nice buns there...
We all love chef John from Food Wishes For posting these vids of his dishes On Tuesdays and Fridays We know we will always Get dad jokes and recipes delicious!
Your folding technique made them into Asian Knishes.....Char Siu Baowitz
There's no such thing as leftover ribs 🤔
Can you please show us a recipe for chicken vermicelli bowl. (Vietnamese) I love your vids!
This time, cayenne pepper felt weird going into this dish. Idk why.
My favourite dim sum item!
Is anyone else thinking about that Pixar short?
You are the Atilla the Hun of your steamed BBQ pork bun.
Ty Chef John you are soley responsible for helping my recipes turn out.  You are  an amazing  Chef and make the hardest things look easy. Love you lots!
Happy 4th of July everyone and you also Chef John! 🎂🇺🇸🏳️‍🌈💥🎆🎇
I thought they were beautimous. I bet they were tasty, too. But I could just sit and look at them. Well, for a while. Then I would eat them ALL!
no FUCKING way. Excuse my language but I’ve been looking for a recipe for this recently, but nothing seemed easy to follow. I’m sure his will,  so... I’ll go watch that now.
Like what we call siopao in the Philippines 🇵🇭!
I thought it was called siopao?
They look awesome! South East Asians make their baos with different fillings. My father would have approved.
Wait.... was that a shaggy dough story ?
Oi Keep it up
You can actually make these a bit whiter simply by adding a small amount of white vinegar to the steaming water. Sadly when I tried making these a few years ago I didn’t have any white vinegar so I used red wine vinegar which resulted in really ugly kind of red dumplings lol. They did still taste yum though.
Don't Sauce me Bearnaise
Dang it... I work tomorrow and there's a vdo.
Omg yum! Also known as "manapua" in Hawaii! 😄
I gave up pork last year and now I hate myself.
Arms look like Burt Reynolds.
Pork Buns with funny puns. Yum 😃
I immediately thought about the Incredibles 2 lol
love me some bao
Why are there solid clouds in your house?
When making steam buns, i usually used milk instead of water. I wonder is there any difference?
Round the outside, round the outside.
Nice ass... I mean buns... I mean ass
Take a bao my friend on a recipe well executed!
Hey chef john
Omgosh hahahaha 😂.  Had know idea.  I didn't know what I was doing. That's how I do things too.
This is the absolute last thing I thought you would make. I'm so excited. I love these.
Dead Yeast! My yeast is always Dead! I buy yeast, (envelope/jar/big bag) put it in the fridge/cabinet, forget about it until I want some bread/rolls/donuts only to discover Dead yeast. Ppppss me off. Go to the store get some more, PPPPPPPS
Nice buns 👍😀
Oh wow, that looks tasty
I wish I had the time to make these. But, at least I can say that I'm as saucy as those buns
What about a Scooby-Doo dough? 🐕 🍞
For a second, I thought the title was “Steamed Hams”
I love you chef john 😉
Them look good
猪肉包子- zhurou baozi. Pork buns
Looks so good! I need to make these i have been planing for it forever! Cute buns! 😋
can you post a picture of your Cayenne Pepper  jar? It must be huge
Been a long time subscriber, but this video felt a bit lazy. Sorry, John.
Insert double entendre here.   But use lube.
Ever since I saw "Incredibles 2" and watched the short "Bao," I've been craving bao!!😛  Thanks for the recipe.  Also be real Chef John, that's the real reason why you made this video, huh? 😉
how about some hams now?
Oh yummm. Could you tell me is that a  stainless steel table you rolled out the dough on? I really like it.
Looks killer , awesome
You can steam my buns any time, Chef John.
I actually made these earlier today and now Chef John makes a video....looks like the Matrix is lagging XD #NotSlick
I think chef john is my twin...everything I make not long later me makes..or something I want to make he already made.....chef john we should open a restaurant together !!
Finally
Chef, you just made me hungry. Isn`t a chef supposed to do the opposite?
Short film before Incredible's two! Anyone?
I was expecting more puns for your bbq char siu buns. 好包子啊，我喜欢猪肉包子呀，这么多啊啊啊！！！
I love a shaggy dough ❤
Been waiting for this for so long
Can you make another dip soon I love those dip videos!
Look at those buns! 😍
360 gang you with me?
Mmmmmm meat pillows.😋
Mmm, steamed hams..!
You are the Tom Yum of your BBQ pork buns
Well done chef!
First
Hi everyone! I hope you have a delicious day!
Look tasty
