I wish had the names of the actual cheeses!!!
It's always the most busted looking cheese
How to become a cheese expert?
"This one is Swiss, but this is American and supporting American cheese is really important" Unless you're not American and especially if you're Swiss.
Im a chese and im a liz thorpe expert this is a mass produced liz thorpe perfect for making a cheese toastie
Surrealistic review😩
I didn't know Dee Williams was a cheese expert
She looks like julia bowen
1:18 Am I the only one that got triggered by her cutting the tip of the cheese? Always got told it was rude and selfish.
im not an "expert" but i got all of them correct by just looking at them.
I got a passing grade (80%) by assuming the more expensive cheese was darker in color
Yet she doesn't know how to pronounces Gouda 😂
She looks like high quality cheese herself.
Dear video makers: it would be incredibly easy to also put the price in metrics in your plaques. Perhaps next time you should try that.
this is not hard, anyone can guess if a cheese is cheap or not. its basically plastic or its not.
Americans will think that saying "Parmegiaan" sounds cultivated when it's actually Parmesan oder Parmegiano, but not something between those.
This would have been *much* more interesting if it was a cheese amateur trying each one and then she walked them through what they tasted/saw after they made their guess.
this is so stupid...
yeah that woman definitely loves her cheeses
which one is more expensive, this plain one, or the one with a rind and wrapped in leaves? 🤔
The content would be so much better if she just guessed the price of the cheese. Still it’s fun to watch
I could have guessed this! Just look for the uglier and smellier cheese.
"aged in plastic" sounds very American
Why she look like sugourney weaver
I bet she loves the smell of her feet
As a lactose intolerant, i watched this video on the toilette.
i only came here because she physically reminds me of Julie Bowen-- i might watch this anyway later on as i love cheese lmao
she be cutting with differnet knives, each fancier than the earlier ones xD
i think they should get two expensive or two cheap, so the difference would be little
What’s the name of the expensive blue cheese at the video ?
Here I am, a lactose intolerant person, watching a cheese expert identify cheap vs expensive cheeses
No doubt...she KNOWS her Cheeses...but......WHO POINT'S WITH THEIR PINKY? (9:01)...and "Wrapped in LEAFS"... 9:23
how does one get the position of cheese expert
I want her to smell things blindfolded and once in a while you have her smell a hockey bag or a pair of shoes and see if she can tell it’s not cheese
An average joe can tell whats more expensive, but an expert, however, knows *why*
Thank you!
im basically a cheese expert
I'm a random Frenchman and i can tell you everyone here is a cheese expert... the différences are easy to make just visually it’s obvious
cheese sniffer!
Loved that video
Since when is goat cheese "brie-style" i think she needs to educate herself a little more.
If this comment gets 1000 likes Ill start a go fund me and try every cheese
She can’t even pronounce the names correctly
Best swiss cheese is my opps
‘You sit around with your friends and eat this style of cheese’ Me, selfish cheese goblin: excuse you
I’m still here. I can’t move on.
30 vs 50 it does change
I always see Blue and Bleu cheese spelled differently. Is there a difference?
She uses names of protected cheese brands to discribe younger fakes. That's unacceptable for a "cheese expert"  she has done at least three errors. There is no such thing as american feta, american parmesan e.t.c. eat what ever you like but stop using our names
Yummy
8:11 "It takes considerably more sheep milk to make the same amount of cheese."  Why?
i am so jealous of this woman
You are criminals... Ageing cheese in plastic? Why? Why? Why?
🇨🇭  is not part of European Union?
FOOD POISONING
She has the bonus - sees them before tasting them.  How about, just tasting them and learn about them later?
She needs a blind taste test.
her eyes are so pretty! almost violet
Why couldn't you just say it's Cabrales?
They actually gave her a cheese wrapped with leaf, and asked which one is the more expensive 🤦🏼‍♀️
why is the parmagianno reggiano irish
An adaptation of the Monty Python cheese shop sketch is called for here
I LOVE CHEEEZZZZZ 🧀
ofc a "cheese expert" is a white woman
I find it hard to accept the first cheese she looks at that’s “really aged” she can’t tell if it’s Gouda or Reggiano.  If you are a cheese expert: 1. You can recognize Reggiano on site, and 2. You would never mistake Reggiano for Gouda.
Let me tell you all a little secret.    Grass is free.
this ‘expert’ cannot even pronounce the names of cheeses properly.
“It’s like biting into a crayon.” As a cheesemonger I would never cite crayons as texture or flavor profile😳😂
she's cute
Nigerian Parmegiano cheese, facepalm
RIP. you went so early and you were an amazing cheese expert! I was sad to learn she passed 😢
Anyone else notice that the aged goat cheese is only 3.33 times more expensive than the fresh goat cheese?
Almost all the blue cheeses in Spain are traditionally wrapped in Maple or Oak leaves.  I'm guessing there are many others around the world as well, not just 2 blue cheeses that are produced like that.
this was too easy....
Aged Gouda or aged parmiggiano reggiano!!!! 😂😂😂 Really? They are sooooo different!!
I guess the FDA takes the fact that a US citizen calls herself a cheese expert as a failure in their mission
Modest cheese queen 🧀 lol I love her
Im alos cheese expert   just by the look I make no mistake
I wonder what the prices are now
She knew the answer before even eating any of them 😭😭😭
Why didn't my career councillor in school advise me about being a cheese expert
This comparison is totally BS, she needs to be blindfolded and someone else needs to give the cheeses to taste blindly. I don't doubt that she is a cheese expert, but I still contend that this proves nothing.
"It tastes like biting into a crayon with little salt crystals in it." "You want it for its flavor"
Plot twist: she didn't need to taste them she just wanted to eat cheese
I’ve watched this video so many times idk why it’s my favorite year after year
cheese expert try not to say parmigiano reggiano challenge (easy mode)
Whoever thought about making this video needs a raise !
I am a cheese addict and just by its look I can tell with 90% accuracy if it is cheap or genuine stuff . Then when I smell it I am at 100% ...tasting is just because I love them !
Your no expert if your guessing
I've watched this probably 10 times now. I love how thorough her explanations are.
Them: Bet you can't guess which is more expensive! Liz: *tells history and age of each cheese before even tasting*
u dont have to be a cheese expert to know which one is more expensive, you just need to have eyes
The test makes no sense. They don't compare cheap VS expensive... They compare cheeses, with different time of riping, different looks etc.
watching this now..$16 of cheese would only get a sliver of any cheese tbh
Is she just pretending she is unsure?  It seems she could name the brand and country of the cheeses without much issue.
True professional
Should have been blind folded and tasted to guess
She looks a bit like the actress that plays the alien in species.
American do love their food quick- made and cheap but also less flavor
Epicurious you dont need to be an expert for these videos its insanely easy to tell them apart even for people who have never tasted the cheese
Some brand names? We’re not all cheese experts.
Admit it you click on this video to see if she'll get something wrong 😂😂😂
I need that job😅
It’s the Irish Parmesan!
You don’t even need to be an expert to see which ones are expensive. The cheeses almost tell a story of how long they’ve been aged and handed ❤️🧀
If it looks weird, moldy, or kinda gross, it’s the expensive one.  If it looks like the stuff you see in the grocery store, it’s the cheap one
To make a long story short the us pales in comparison to Europe in Cheese.
she really needed a job after modern family huh
No chalk art? :(
The idea of cheese itself is rampant and foul I blame Europeans
Sigourney Cheddar is here
when is she going to eat maggot cheese
YUMMY I LIKE EATING CHEESE
The B blue cheese is Rouge River Blue btw. Not sure why she didn’t say it. It’s soaked in pear liqueur and wrapped with gravel leaves
I guss I am a chees expert
This reminds me of my French friend, he's just an ordinary French dude who happens to eat quality cheeses in his country on daily basis. He just have less appreciation with my Kraft cheez whiz.
Well the "cheap" cheeses are still expensive for me; I resolved to Kraft 35 cents.
The more expensive cheese isn’t always the best cheese to use on all occasions. For instance, it’s a waste to use Parmigiano-Reggiano when trying to mix cheese into a cheese sauce for macaroni (you could but the complex flavors might get drowned out). I wouldn’t want to have the aged goat cheese for times when I want a lighter snack. It’s a matter of informed decision making on the cheese’s characteristics more than the cost.
A cheese expert… I feel like only a white person will ever claim that 😂
elle resemble a une souris
I immediately thought that she strikes me as a cheese connoisseur
The American parmezan is called "Gene"
She didn’t need to taste the cheese, she wanted to.
What kind of cheese experts tells you to buy american parmesan knstead of parmigiano reggiano!!!!!! Lol only in america
6:02 joshua conner moon seething
Is there anything better than cheese (not including wine lol)? Gosh i love finishing my meals at the restaurant with a nice cheeses plate instead of dessert. And of course accompanying it with the rest of your wine bottle mmmm
Anyone else think her eyes are insanely intense lmao
Who splurged once a year on cheese? I love food but that is foreign to me.
cheese people
The term "special party cheese" needs to be a part of my vocabulary now.
dys🌸
Ty
Yssbasm
If Cheese was a female this would be the healthiest interpertation.
Where can I find that special blue cheese
She's an expert but pronounces Gouda as wrong as it's possible. xD
🧀
As a cheese enjoyer but in no way a connoisseur sometimes i can say some cheese is better than others and certains things are simply not cheese, but I enjoy cheese in general so just having cheese makes me very happy
In summary, the wrinklier the raisin, the sweeter the fruit
Cheesy! 😁👍
Great, now i have to do my own research to find out what type of cheese gets wrapped in leaves.

this lady defitenly can has some of my cheese if u know what i mean ;P * grabs groin
What?! No comparison of Kraft Singles vs runny cheese in a jar? How are we to know what to put on the nachos for our husbands' and his friends game day party?
Cheese is overpriced in murica
Usually even bad cheese is still good, but good cheese is even better 👍🧀🧀
I focused only her eyes. They are purple, she is truly blessed.
I love cheese I would give you a run for your money on  tasting them x
Unless you shaved it, the Parmigiano Reggiano MUST have the typical rind with the punctured words Parmigiano Reggiano. If it hasn't got it, then it's not the Original PR but just another imitation.
I don’t personally fw epicurious but I love this video and this cheese woman 🧀
she looks like a cheese expert.
I love blue cheese, but I’ve never once smelled it and thought, “mm fruity”
I learned from my grandma (she went on a trip to some European cities) that the cheese produced where I live is actually *very* soft, and it would take a lot for us to get used to The Good Cheese™️. So, with that in mind, I'll *gladly* take that fresh goat cheese from you if you don't want it.
2:25 - I believe you're using Irish flag instead of Italian
I haven't read all the comments but I'm pretty certain the last blue cheese is the Organic Rogue River Creamery Blue that is released in limited edition in November.    I still have a couple wedges of it left at my shop.  I might have to bring one home before it's gone.
THIS HAS BEEN IN MY TOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YEARS. NO MATTER WHAT I WATCH. OK FINE I HAVE FINALLY CRACKED.  Edit: worth it. quality video right there. thank u youtube algorithm for not giving up on me.
i think except the feta this was mostly common sense. not really hard to tell the difference
The Blue Cheese (the expensive one) I think is the one that won the 2019 “Best Cheese in the World”. First time the US has ever won…..from Rogue in Oregon.
She really knows how to cut the cheese....
I’m not even going to watch the video. I’m just here to ask if anyone knows how I could become a cheese expert
why does she look like cheese?
What happened to your wonderful artist who decorated the blackboard behind the experts!!??!? I miss her art!!! It added so much
Please bring back this series.
Why does the Parmesan Reggiano have an Irish flag next to it? 🥴 The Irish aren’t renowned for their cheese!
I loved the blue cheese section because I immediately knew not only which was more expensive, but exactly where the expensive one was from. I'm a cheesemonger in Massachusetts and Rogue River Blue is the most expensive large format cheese we have in our shop at anytime. I always tell my friends to try it even if they don't like blues just because it's an experience. It's also the only American cheese to win Best Cheese in the world.
What happens to the leftover cheese? 😂
I've never seen someone getting visually aroused by blue cheese.
Them: What's your dream job? Me:  It's complicated...
Is there any video on this channels where Experts are wrong?
Why aren’t chees’s ever marked Kosher?
Cheese expert? You just love cheese right
Very informative, but I wish she mentioned who the farmer is that makes the leaf wrapped blue cheese?
PLEASE BRING BACK PRICEPOINTS!
Seems like i have missed my call. I for sure needed to become a cheese expert.
Let's see ... I wonder which is more expensive..... an aged, sharp, grass-fed cheddar?.....or Cheese Wiz?
without being any sort of expert, those picks were obvious and easy.
Pretty ignorant about "Alpine" cheeses. The Alpine regions have more variety in Cheese than all of the US combined. I know cheese stores where you can get hundrets o different cheeses and none are American...
Now i want some cheese 🧀 🤡💔
how do u eat brie
Thanks Liz for your incredible simple and very informative videos about cheeses 🧀👍👍👍.
I invented a cure to lesbian
Again, I say bring this series back. If anything, make it a “how to look for quality in a grocery store” series.
This should have been blind folded. Even i predicted which is more expensive by visually analysing them and i have only had cottage and processed cheese in my life
ngl she look like a mom lol
Ok, you lost me as a viewer when you couldn't be arsed to convert all the prices to the same weights, so they can be compared. Lazy.
A cheese expert….really
wrong flag
Sorry but even I guessed which where the more expensive ones.
My lactose intolerance is being triggered through the screen.
I think this women likes cheese? Could be reading her wrong, unsure.
i diden't know parmesan-reggiano was from Ireland, pretty cool
Seeing blue cheese makes me want to undress myself, does anyone else feel the same way?😹
I would love to know which cheeses these artisanal cheeses are... "made by one farm in the world..." yeah okay... But which one is it? Blue Stilton? Montagnolo? Gorgonzola? There's plenty of blue cheeses that are expensive. I wanna know!
I have to say this with out having prior knowledge of cheese i guessed all expensive cheese right....just select the odd looking one out 😂
Yeah. This video was pointless.
it's earlier in the series so that chalkboard art isn't quite there yet
Cheese candy  Crunchy cheese Mind blown
I like cheese
Alpine Cheese: supporting this type of production is really important But i buy the parmigian aged in plastic over the regulated cause it's cheaper
I looked it up and that cheese with the leaves at the end won World's Best Cheese in 2019, it's made in Oregon.
Wait! Eating cheese is a job???
If you count american parmesan as real parmesan, you could as well count cottage cheese for buffalo mozzarella. Understand me right, cheese are expensive because of the work put into it, reserving production space for maturing the A-team among cheese for sometimes more than a year, turning and rewetting them every day. This is why expensive cheese is expensive. PS: how do you americans get _fromage qui pue_ (=french for 1st quality stinking cheese) without smuggeling unpasteurized cheese to the USA? On ships on international waters?
That was a pretty easy challenge. I'm not a cheese expert, but it was obvious which ones had more work put into them just by looking at them.
Idk anything about cheese but I’m not eating anything made of milk that’s been left out for 18 months. Hell no
Lol the best cheese of me is the cheapest
Why there is an Irish flag next to the Italian cheese 😂🇮🇪
She seemed by far to prefer the cheaper, American feta to me, but then recommended the more expensive one after finding out the price. Seems fishy.
Why does saying I'm a cheese expert sound so pretentious lol. ps she has to be constipated lol haha. PPs I love cheese
You’re invited to my fondue party :)
So we just gonna pretend the Parmesan price tag doesn’t have the Irish flag next to it instead of the Italian flag.
So educational!
they used the irish flag for the first italian parmesan💀😭
I am new to cheese . The cheese I kept in refrigerator turned blue spots one day . I had to throw them away . Do you think they turned bad or aged ?
I’m just eating a whole block of mozzarella rn help
I make my own cheese. I age it for about a month until its ripe and tangy. Then I scrape it from under my foreskin and serve it on crackers. Guests absolutely love it.
They must've held a cheese tasting party to eat up the cheese..
i love the way she described the smells and flavors, i couls almost taste it through the screen
1:17 did this mf just fart while speaking 🗿
I stopped watching at "I personally don't notice the difference" *facepalm* Noob.
Ahh, so it's more expensive because organizations artificially limits the production. Funny how that works.
please stop with the up-speak dang it's like every sentence is a question
And she really doesn't reveal the type of cheese in the last one?? Great  A quick search reveals it to be called Rogue River Blue.
Plot twist: she's lactose intolerant
"This one is older, creamier, tastes better  and therefore more expensive."  Said no pimp ever.
That knife is totes adorbs
lol... seriously? let's give maximum visual clues before we even get to the tasting part And - oh yeah - American cheeses suck
I’d love to know what the day to day of a cheese expert looks like. Is she on call? Or has she simply become that good of a cheese taster that she doesn’t need to taste cheese anymore and simply exists as the go to cheese expert. So many questions
Ah but would she know a Lancashire from a Cheshire?
Dude why isnt she blindfolded
Chinese can easily make all of them with half price. AhahahaHAHAHAHAHAA
Ok but how does one become a professional cheese expert?
Having dinner with people that know so much about the food being served is such a joyful experience it's almost as if you are tasting the work to create the products.
Either I've wasted my life, or she's wasted hers
She loves cheeses and she's smoking hot, what an item...
She's indeed an expert 😲👏👏
Remember, no matter the price, it all goes down the same place.
In Europe it wouldnt be allowed to call the us made cheeses with its original name. Like Feta, in Europe only cheese from Greece is allowed to have this name.
Cheeses loves you all my childs, happy easter
"Cheese expert tries to justify her existence"
Actually parmigiano Reggiano it's min 12 months
I'm a self-taught Tuna Expert. I would love to become a Cheese Expert :D
I love how she makes spaces and has settings for cheese as opposed to a lot of other people that would “spit on you” for daring to bring a cheap cheese
You can tell she knows nothing about cheese by the way she talks about Parmigiano and the way she cut it 😂
She looks like Julie Bowen, the mom on the tv show Modern Family
Me: sleep time Phone: want to watch the cheese lady guess the cheese? Me: 🧀
2:23🇮🇹 This is Our flag, not this one 🇮🇪
Cheese expert "God this is a hard one... one is hand-wrapped around in mulberry leaves and looks expensive, but the other has holes... I wonder which is the more expensive one
Omg her eyes
why is there an ireland and not an italy flag with the parmesiano regiano ?
We just need an air expert who travels the world and smells the quality of the air
That $28/lb American Alpine style cheese looks like Pleasant Ridge. Can anyone confirm?
her: "it's got lots of fruity flavors" whenever I taste different cheese: "hmmm it's cheese"
IT'S NOT PARMESAN, it's PARMIGGIANO REGGIANO! (as the expert lady said) all the rest it's a mere imitation.
I don’t think she needed to taste them because she knew the difference by looking at them lol
Her math is bad. The goat cheese was not 5 times expensive.
……………….. 2:26 ist this an IRISH flag ????????
She can’t be an expert, she pronounces Gouda the wrong way completely, it’s pronounced Houda not Gouda. Stupid blonde lady, how stereotypical
Next time blind fold her lol
Can I be on your show?! I mean it can be really hard to tell what costs more and I think I could guess correctly for less than what you pay there people from this show. 🤔
So, okay lady your "A Mouse Or A Rat" got it!! 🍽 🧀
This was hardly rocket science. You're average foodie could guess as well as the "cheese expert"
1:17 who farted lmao
She should do this blind folded and given bite-size.
This lady is extremely intelligent & at the peak of her craft. It's astonishing
Apparently i am a cheese expert and all I had to do was watch a few videos
The only food i miss as a vegan is cheese. But going vegam was definitely worth it
Ще извадят сирене и няма да сложат българско, пууу
She is so happy lol  Makes me happy
She is good 👍
I love how she doesn't talk down on the cheaper products.  I remember switching to a more expensive parmesano reggiano, and after a few months deciding that I preferred the flavor of the cheap stuff for what I was using it for.  Expensive doesn't mean you'll like it more, expensive just means it required more effort.  It is what it is, enjoy what you like.  Sometimes there's no substitute for the unnatural ooey gooey thing you get from fake processed cheese.  Other times there's no substitute for something that was crafted by a 34th-generation Italian grandma using only her feet.  Depends on what you're doing.
Barely skimmed the title and honestly thought it said "Chinese Expert"
So what, you could get ANY white woman up there to guess cheese
I bet her farts smell
I could just tell by look and im not an Cheese Expert at all.
This is just a "are you good at your job".
How does this affect Lebron’s Legacy?
i got a different type of special party cheese
When I grow up I hope someone refers to me as, “…this is the “It’s New Years. It’s Christmas I’m gonna splurge on something that I can only get once a year? This is that cheese!”
I guessed everything right without hearing the explanation or tasting the cheeses. IDK if cheese is just easily distinguishable by looks, or it's just specific for these cheeses. More info pleasee!! :D
She looks like a cheese.
This is a very wholesome video.
I bet they pay her in cheese.
i dont even like cheese
1:18 they did not just add a farting sound when she cut that cheese😂
I guessed every one correct, and i never eat cheese. Dont need to be an expert to see which cheese is more moldy
She too skinny to be an expert.
Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."
Who grows up and says “I wanna be a cheese expert”?
Is so easy to identify the cheese but she makes it hard because she’s blahbling to much
I hate those crystals in my cheese. They just knock off the whole eating for me.
Yeah she looks like a cheese expert
I’m a cheese expert 👩‍🔬
You’re telling me this isn’t Cynthia Nixon?
2:24 Irish flag instead of Italian
Lord, she's so cheesy.
She can’t even say Parmigiano-Reggiano properly
“Let’s take this stuff we squeezed out of an animal, make it go bad, then put it on a shelf and let it get dry and moldy and maybe have bugs living on it. Then let’s make everyone love putting it in their mouths so much that they envy the rare people who make a living putting extra-dry, extra-moldy versions of it in their mouths.”
My ex used to call Gruyère - sweaty ball bag cheese cuz of the smell 🤣
I picked the wrong career
the first one was not a challenge wtf
I honestly don’t know why I’m watching this cause I don’t like cheese but there is something that keeps me staying 🤔
I love how there is a different knife for each cheese loll
"Tastes like you are biting into a crayon" that's exactly what I want when I buy food -.-
This is the most beautiful cheese expert in world I bet on it. haha  edit: tho she can dress better ;p
Eden nothing else
i love that she obviously immediately can tell just from visuals which is more expensive but loves cheese so much she has to keep it ambiguous so she tastes it anyway
I like that cheese knife! Edit: oh! Multiple cheese knives!
I don't care all that much about cheese, but this seriously held my attention all the way through! What a wonderful expert.
Switzerland is not part of the EU
eww. goat cheese smells awful
those cheeses must've came from great oxes and made by great peoples  i know many mouses who would love to taste it using their tooths
that brain goat cheese gave me the heebie jeebies
What do you want to be when you grow up Sally?  I like cheese
2:31 you're welcome
7:27 thats the age difference
Cheese is disgusting.   Mold and rot.
There is *no* EU subsidies to Swiss cheeses producers, because Switzerland is *not* part of the European Union.
She's a "cheese expert" but she don't know how to cut them...
It is not that weird that cheese or wine experts exist. there are experts in all kinds of food and they are legitimate jobs in the food industry , cause companies need to know whether a food characteristic is changing  with the modification of some variables .
why do the use the irish flag at 2:25?
Actually isn't it obvious from the very first sight which one is more expensive? Meeh
This video is sponsored by Constipation
She is Constipated now
I could literally have done this and I don't like most cheeses.
I bet you she isnt an expert at all but she is just living in the moment for the free cheese lol
No milk expert?😏 PAUSE! giggity giggity!😏
Anyone notice that the flag is Irish?
I should study for math exam right know…Instead I am watching this.
instead of italy flag thdy showed an irland flag💀💀braindead
are you playing some games with the Italians here or why are you showing the Irish Flag for a Parmiggiano Reggiano? https://youtu.be/lR-oJvKJyUY?t=144 Seriously, this offends even me as a german
cheese.
imagine she gets lactose intollerant
it looks like you used the irish flag instead of the italian flag lol
if not grass what else are they feeding cows?????
Tell me you grew up rich without telling me you grew up rich.
How do you become a cheese expert?
i thought you said cheap expert
Casu martzu
2:20 of the expert can't tell the difference too much, don't think you will either
Is that irish Parmigiano-Reggiano?
Next Challenge should be blindfolded, I feel like most people could get it if they just looked at it lmao…
How about some foreskin cheese?
How tf cheese have fruity flavors
Disappointed that they didn’t throw a wad of kraft singles in there
Liz THORPE ?! Ain't that Claire Dunphy ? 🤯
how do i become a cheese expert
If you can't pronounce 'Gouda' correctly maybe you ain't no expert...
Great. Now i’m craving for cheese
Anyone else currently watching this after binging food insider now feeling like a low-key damn know-it-all? 😅
Cheese is such a blessing 👏🏻❤️🥰 I’m so happy I live in a time I can have all these wonderful kinds of cheese 😩🙌🏻❤️
You know, I’m something of a cheese expert myself
why am I watching this
oh cheeses! 🧀
2:23 , that's an Irish flag not an Italian one.
Funny how they only add the flags when one of the cheeses is made in the USA
Woah making these damn near impossible...... smh might as well give her blubel
10:52 Sorry madam i don’t spent that much on cheese for new year’s and i don’t see anyone doing the same.
all asians can say they are experts….in rice
I’m not a cheese expert at all and I could tell which one was the most expensive by simply looking at it. Please do better
Idk why YouTube brought me this but it's very interesting
Mmmm...love cheese.
me: its cheese and it smells bad and sometimes taste good
I guess we don’t need a cheese expert…I only guessed one wrong. I don’t even like to eat cheese.
What’s the name of the blue cheese wrapped in the leaf
I love that these say "expert guesses". Lol. You're an expert. There's no guessing invovled.
Bro b was always expensive
Didn’t know a “cheese expert” existed
They need to do this with a blindfold. Any moron can tell which is more expensive by the look
This channel has experts tasting what they specialize in?! How satisfying, how informative, how fun?! Love it.
Could she please pronounce the cheese the way it has to be pronounced??
why need a expert you put a new cheese beside a aged cheese so easy to see which is more expensive omfg
I hate cheese why am i watching this
Actually I am no cheese expert but it is easy to guess, the older it looks the more expensive it is!
She looks like eminem
I feel like they need to do this first as a blind taste test, get their initial guess based on test, then show them the two samples and let the expert adjust their guess.  Then do the reveal.    This format is way too easy with real experts knowing which is the expensive and which is the cheap one by just looking at it.
White people love cheese.
U lactose intolerant? Then f*ckin tolerate it!
I love protein crystals in cheese
Time to get some old cheese from stores and sell it online once it ages 😈
its like, asking an astronomer what the third planet on our solar system is 😭 what's the point
they LOOK like they're a cheese expert. /neg
Blue cheese is the most disgusting thing to ever exist. I’m more of a Brie person myself.
That room must smell nasty
They used the flag of Ireland for Italy..
Her: it’s fruity, it’s nutty, it’s lemony, it’s salty, it smells like olives Me:  cheese is cheese
way too many type of cheeses
can't wait for "cannibalism expert guesses cheap vs expensive cadavers"
I never eat rat bait.
Lame.  Make her test it blindfolded.  100% she won't be able to tell.
Was she on top chef family style ?
You know it's expensive when it tastes like soap
as a french person, i honestly, genuinely feel like i would have made the exact same comments about the cheese when seeing them
Damn, identifying cheeses is like identifying minerals in geology, it feels difficult.  If on another planet and we found cheese I wonder if Matt Damon would have any problems identifying the different cheeses.
Imagine being a cheese expert
i am CRAVING cheese so so so so so so so much now😐.      thanks
1:10  how does she know how it feels to bite into a crayon?
So I live in the gruyère region and I really don't get the argument of vote with your dollar. Switzerland is a country where it snows in winter. The gruyère cows live on pastures in summer where they eat grass, but in winter they have to be fed hay, because there is no grass. Is the argument that one should only have cows in places where the ground never freezes?
This is a mouse dressed as a woman
Whats next? Receipt expert?
*“Now this looks like a job for me”*
You can just tell by appearance which is more expensive
She is a cheese expert but pronounced gouda wrong :(
I'm something of a cheese expert myself. If the cheese tastes nothing like I've ever bought, it's expensive.
I need to stop watching these videos because every time I do I buy a wheel of Brie cheese
I think the expensive blue cheese is maybe the rogue river blue. Which I wanna try badly lol.
"American style..." That's never a great way to describe any good cheese.
I predicted the type and winner 100%, can I please have this job?! 😋
Why I just watched a woman talk about cheese for 11 minutes, I will never know....
There was an Irish flag instead of Italian at the first cheese!
2:23 parmigiano reggiano from Ireland?
Switzerland is not a member of the EU, they do not need their subsidies, they are smart.
This is a cheese expert?? Mi chiahuahua could probably do a better job.  Even her description is so abstract and the terminology is completely off.  Hilarious how you gave her the easiest possible comparisons; this video is complete garbage!
Did you mix up the goat cheese? Cause usually goat cheese crumbles if I remember correctly
I find it a little confusing how the sides are flipped when they cut to the overhead view, think it would be better if they were on the same side next time!
I didn't know Rachel McAdams was a cheese expert.
Someone Farted in 1:18 . The sound of the people who love Cheese.
They should make them look the same. An expert would know the difference anyway, but be fair.
Too easy to tell by appearance alone. It would be interesting to make a real blind taste test video, with the tester blindfolded and everything.
I was expecting there to be mozzarella
As a french person: What the heck is Alpine cheese? there are hundred of cheese made in mountain! All have a name.
Such beautiful eyes 🥺
So cheese is super expensive in the US, eh?
How do you say Rogue River Blue without saying "Rogue River Blue"? 10:11 🤣
Crunchy cheese sounds so unappealing
Im doing the wrong job, if not everyone thought it was pretty easy to detect the expensive cheese by optics 🙈 i think its crystal clear in a matter of seconds if you eat cheese from time to time… no need to be an expert with those comparisons 🧀
Did someone farted at 1:16?
This has to be my dream job
Idk how peiple eat old cheese, i would be gagging
Someone farted during parmagano test
SWITZERLAND. IS NOT IN THE EU
and In our Universe .... normal salarie  200/300 U$S  per mount like 4 or 8 lbs of bluechrismaschess ... please stop saving the planet and the animals and start invertions and productivity in the 3th world ... bye cheese
Nobody :   Me at 3 am : Hmmmm .....that's interesting
Always choose Cheese B.
Why she got so many funky knives for cutting off a chunk of cheese?
I was really hoping for casu marzu 😅
4:03 not 5 times as expensive, but about 3.33 times as expensive
Why is she acting like the two cheeses aren't meant to be the same type of cheese?  Annoying
I would be very good at this
Knob cheese should be in this
That's so annoying that they didn't name the final cheese! What is it?
Christianity is a religion if anyone needs a religion to join,god loves all and forgives all, god can help you through what ever you are going through,you just have to believe,be safe everyone,have a nice day,i hope you have a good day
This video is cheesy af
I actually love cheese
It's like mukbang to us lactose intolerant ppl...lol
She looks like she eats 39lbs of cheese a day
you're not fat enough to be a cheese expert!!
A "cheese expert" who cannot pronounce the names of different cheeses properly? Brie cheese is made of cow's milk, not goat. And I know you said "Brie style", not just Brie, but, you are the expert. Say Chabichou, Cabécou, or Banon. Those who do not know, will look it up. I'll pass dear!
That bleu cheese is rogue river bleu, made in South Eastern Oregon by rogue river farms. Those leaves are pear leaves and if I'm not mistaken its also been brushed with pear brandy. In 2018 or 19 it won best cheese in the world. Prior to that award it was 20 dollars a pound and I used it for everything, now its impossible to find because they release it in batches. Rogue river caveman is a good alternative
Wtf I didn’t no Parmigiano Reggiano is from Ireland. According to the flag on the reveal card.
Cheese is cheese ok
Can someone teach her to handle properly a knife and cut the cheese in the right way?
not to state the obvious but she cut the cheese at least ten times.
i dont like cheese that much and could guessed everything just by looking. My Family likes Cheese... xd
In the Parmesan, THAT IS NOT AN ITALIAN FLAG. IT IS IRELAND 2:26. Compare it to USA's red.
Does eating all that cheese affect your smell?
The video is great but i gotta to say she looks like a young Sigourney Weaver
Protein crystals are my favorite! I had no idea what caused that texture
02:26 Nice Irish flag there
She must have a really healthy gut microbiome !
Isn't reggiano supposser to be pronounced without the i?
I am happy to live in Europe where these cheeses are more affordable
Smells nutty 😳
Anyone else really miss this series?
This is the job I need
SHE'S THE QUEEN OF CHEESE!!!
the darker the color of the cheese, the more expensive it is
I recently had my first nice cheese and it was way better than the cheese squares
Anything with a rind is more expensive apparently
Real cheese is one food that is worth the investment every single time.
I am no cheese expert but I was guessing along with her and got all of them right 😂 I just figure the uglier the more expensive
3:19 some one laughing at the background/coughing
Would like more info on these brands
Modern family person
Me watching this, while eating a slice of cheese from the refrigerator....yeah I am kind of a cheese expert myself
finally, i have found my dream job
I love cheese
I DOLOVE CHEESES, in the 60s I used o make my own cheese dressing   Using ROQUFORT.   I buy lots of STILTON, which I eat many times by themselves where I grew up, DANISH BLUE   Was a standard BLUE, , Easter was BUN & CHEESE,,, GHOUDA,  I tend to go for the ‘SMELLY’cheeses,   Even LIMBURGER, there is ONLY 1 COMPANY WHICH makes it in USA, however MATAG BLUE should not count, it’s awful,,  ENGLISH CHEDDER is great, , Gorgonzola crumbled over salad is nice too,,,🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Damn cheese sounds like a good investment. Just leave it around for a few months and its basically compound interest
Actually the goat cheese is just 3.2 times more expensive not 5😅
I know the skill to value the cheese. If it looks older, it is more expensive.
I don't even like cheese, yet here i am
Smells kinda nutty you say
This woman is impressive!
it's better to take the swiss cheese, because, it's a little production of an artisanal product (if you live in Europe)
I love that she is holding so much to not say the cheese name 8:30
funny that you described more expensive parmesan with "waxy" and "crayon". Which are not eve food related words. How is that suppose to be enticing? The cheap stuff you used "creamy" and "candy" to describe. What does that say? I'm just scratching my head.
I am dissapointed her name wasn't Brie Pamerson.
Look, you summoned my french side.
Cool occupation
I want this job
Holly from the office is doing well.
She looks like cheese
I want the cheese and some wine and her once the wine start working it magic!!
just wanted to share appreciation for the cheese knife :)
"It's like biting into a crayon" wait, have you eaten crayons before?-
Please, for god’s sake, fire the person who edited this video.
nobody: the person who made the alphabet: 3:05
What a cheesy video.
I swear this person was a rat in their previous life
whats your job? Liz: "oh yeah im a cheese expert"
I don't even like cheese why am I watching this
The way she says "parmegiano-reggiano" is soooo satisfing oml
I didn’t know that pumpkin from flavor of love was an cheese expert
Funny how they used the irish flag instead of the italian flag for the Parmigiano-Reggiano x'D
Oooh!.. I like her.
Going to be honest, i came into this expecting the cheese expert to be absolutely destroyed. I came out of it with alot learnt about cheese
5:35 me too cheese, me too
Please show us a „cheese“ counter
I'm personally a fan of the grocery store "fiesta blend" cheese. Very complex, very delicious.
blue cheese has mold in it!? not eating that again lol
her breath after this video: DISGUSTANG
From a French point of view, it's funny to see no runny ou creamy cheeses being tested, because we have soooooo many variety of those xD But yeah she know her stuff... and obviously didn't needed to taste them but who doesn't want to.
No such thing as a cheese expert really, because there’s cheeses from different parts of the world that everyone likes differently, like cheeses from South America, aged or not, that might not be liked by others around the world and there’s cheeses in North America aged or not that might not liked in South America, everyone has their own taste, Gordon Ramsay is supposedly high quality type food, but when he tries to remake food around the world like in Mexico and phillipines and India, to name a few, it’s not accepted because he makes it to his liking which usually consist of the least amount of salt and sugar but some foods require more because of the dish it self, so it depends who you ask, the only expert thing most people can tell is which one taste more like plastic (due to preservatives) vs regular cheese.
the expensive goat cheese reminds me a bit of polish oscypek
🇮🇹 🇮🇪
I consider myself a cheese expert
If she is cheese expert then she should know how to pronounce Parmigiano Regian...
Mhm... here in Italy you find Parmigiano Reggiano for €16 the Kg. And the proteine crystals are the normal costincency about it. The other one should be called "parmesan cheese". It's just USA cheese
Alternative Title: Cheese Expert is really good as being a Cheese Expert
I'm lactose intolerant. What the hell am I doing here?
That irish parmigiano has to be good
They should of done difference between squeeze cheese and burger cheese
How does one become a cheese expert? Because my boyfriend and I would like to apply
Her eyes look like she sniffed roo much cheese
This ‘expert’ has got a lotta dumb energy, lolz 😂
I know absolutely nothing about cheese but this is so interesting!
so whatever cheese looks old asf is the more costly cheeze
did anybody notice in the first cheese they used the Irish flag instead of Italy's which is green white red not green white orange
why did I watch this, I don't even like cheese -_-
I am waiting for the expert to fail but nah not my day lol
I would date her. I can appreciate people who know their craft
Cows: *Make milk* Humans: “Lemme leave it out in the sun and see what happens”
I'm ju
how about a blind taste test.. i guessed them all without knowing anything about cheese, i feel like this is way to obvious
I ain’t no cheese expert, I’m just french  And yeah that’s sufficient to get em right by the looks lmao
1:13 "biting into a crayon with little salt or sugar crystals in it"😂
In the first one the flag it's the Irish flag I mean the Italy and Irish look similar but they don't look the same 2:27
She is so incredibly white.
How dare you make a video on cheese without presenting french cheese ? France has started wars for less than that.
Why am I watching this? I am lactose intolerant!
guys im kinda disturbed by how the goat cheese looked...
When you feel smart because you saw a video of Rogue River Blue Cheese a few weeks ago and knew what it was as soon as it showed up in this video.
Cows in North norway is feed grass a lot plus they live a happy and the cheese/milk is fantastick
why am i watching this
The more disgusting the more expensive.
Well looks like im a Cheese Expert...
What tf do Americans knows about cheese?!!
They're all pretty obvious except the Alpine cheese, generally the one that looks crustier/funkier is more expensive mostly because aging.
her eyes are freaking violet.
i am from parma and that is not parmigiano reggiano
They weren't playin when they said cheese expert
This woman LOOKS like a cheese expert
7:45  And all the Greeks cheer! Someone could actually tell which one was the genuine real feta cheese! 😆
Lady definitely looks how I imagine a cheese expert would.
Watching this in 2021 after the popularity boom of rogue river blue. I immediately saw it and finally recognized it
If you “guessing” you ain’t no expert, no confidence at all
Conclusion: Europe makes excellent cheese. USA has good cheese experts.
her breath must be rancid
Isn’t mold a health hazard? Why are we eating mold
ok so the uglier the cheese the more expensive 😆
Darn it I got the feta wrong but then again I didn't get to taste any of these :P I love handmade expensive cheeses it's really a few times a year treat when I can go to the cheese shop and get a pound of variety cheeses for a pretty penny with some good fitting wine, crackers, nuts and grapes, but it's so worth it!!
She is making up smells I’m telling you
I hate the way she says REGGIEANO after I heard an Italian woman say it.
wait you pay 29$ for a little less than half a kilo for parmigano-regiano (to be fair i live close to italy but i didn't know it was that expensive to ship it)
She seems pretty cheesy ngl
I’m lactose intolerant.  My stomach doesn’t care if the cheese is cheap or expensive.
She is so beautiful! honestly was surprised at how entertained I was by a cheese video
You dont need to be an expert to tell a cheap cheese from an expensive one
It's new for me that Swiss is in the EU
She can actually answer right away with just looking by it she just tastes it as a formality of the challenge. I also noticed that there are different knife for each cheese.
Honestly anyone can do this, with meats, cheese etc. These experts think theyre smart but actually anyone can do their jobs
You don't have to be an expert to tell what cheese is more expensive you can tell by looking at them smh self proclaimed cheese expert I'm actually a frozen pizza expert
Why she kinda bad
You can guess everything right just by looking at it
Not saying I’m better or know anymore but I think I could easily guess most of them based on look alone
as a french guy you dont need to be a so called expert to know which is pricier. any average french person knows the which would be which
First cheese, thats the flag of Irland not Italy. Where is the red?
Cheese isn’t my favourite
She looks like a cheese expert
God, I love cheese you wouldn't even understand.
The one with the rind and darker colour is expensive.. easy 😂
Now she needs to react to top 29 quintillion cheese
So we all here in the early hours of the morning watching videos about cheese huh?
The chalk artist called in sick this day
Cheese Expert? Man the professions people come up with these days
Can we just talk about her purple eyes?
ok but who gets to keep the leftover cheeses?
This is a great one. She was quick and to the point!
I keep thinking shes an actor, I recognise her from somewhere... I think she reminds me of Victoria from HIMYM
got all of them right based on looks alone, guess im also a cheese expert now xD
The ritzy badger increasingly stamp because lift concurringly trap anenst a obedient breath. chunky, infamous port
girl i dont wanna learn about cheese, just guess istg
4:00 - She may know cheese but she doesn't know math.  $4/4 oz = $1/oz. $20/6 oz = $3.33/oz.  So the more expensive cheese is NOT five times as expensive as the less expensive cheese, it's three-and-a-third times more expensive.
1:12 you ate a crayon?
I like my cheese young :)
experts can tell for sure but can a non expert guess?????
I too. Love cheese
Well its bCoz cheese are creamy… its milk that goes on a lot of process..
Yahhhhhdeya
An expert can taste the different. But a pretender would not
Just taste and tell if your real
Scripted 4 sure
Just taste and tell..    LIVE
This is a BS.. Why not taste and pick. Your an expert anyway
Does slot better than wine sommelier.
Her at 5:02 & me looking at overly expensive  cheese, ALWAYS:  “I think I need to… taste them.”
dont need to taste it to know which one is the expensive one, if it looks bad its expensive
Cheep feta is better in my opinion.  I decided to splurge once and it was not worth it.
The cheap one is better because it has to be.  Simple as that
congratulations your an expert on animal puss
ew the politicial insinuations at the alpine cheese. keep that stuff out of here. go get universal healthcare or something.
The blue cheese on the right looked like it was covered in a big leaf
no front she looks like an oblivion character
I love cheese
@7:50 You can tell she played this game with her Dad when she was a girl. 🤣
anyone could tell which ones better bro
take a shot everytime she says the word 'cheese'...
It's not hard to determine which is more expensive, I just guessed which ever looked more dry to me. But I like the cheese facts.
"So what do you do?"  "I'm a cheese expert."
why am I back here watching this for a fifth time
This is probably the least difficult thing to determine which is more expensive
just sitting here watching them unfold their knowledge on cheese, while knowing absolutely nothing about it, is surprisingly comforting
Pls do a wine expert taste wines so we finally show they know nothing aat aall xDD
How did I get here......
video idea: two experts guess the more expensive item in the other person’s field
I think she knows the right answers even without tasting them, but she just wants to have a bite because why not :D
Spend money on Parmigiano Reggiano
Why did they pick some of the worst cheese from America? We have so much better than that, oh well doesn't matter.
Generally, these videos just boil down to whichever food looks nastier, is gonna be more expensive
I think i’ll stick with my craft cheese:)
my advice is look for the cheeses your country produces locally or that are closest to you. There are thousands of variations of cheese all around the world, you wanna eat good food, food you can trust, this way you can also help your local economy that way.
why am i watching people eat cheese wtf is wrong with me
I love how I know nothing about the finer details of cheese but even I can tell which is more expensive. These are way too easy.
Wait, what? The alpine cheeses.. wouldn't you want to support the traditional method? It's cheaper AND more authentic. You lost me at that part.
this is so easy, the one that looks more nasty is more expensive. just look at them
I guessed all the more expensive cheese 🧀makes me a cheese expert.
Whatever one looks like something you would find in a plastic container or in the supermarket is not the expensive one
try all best 500 cheese
it’s midnight and i’m lactose intolerant what am i doing
But most of these videos are just super obvious.
I guessed every cheese right do easily I mean come on you don’t need to be an expert to even see the visible difference between the cheeses. Next time use cheeses that are the exact same sort and also do not show it to her… blindfold or something
Gorgonzola
I am not Italian, I do not even speak Italian (or very little) but her pronunciation of "parmigiano" casued me physical pain everytime she said it... for cheese's sake, it is Italian (she knows where does it come from for sure) not French
No one else noticed the Irish flag on the Parmesan reggiano??! 🇮🇪
Can't call the American stuff Feta. By definition Feta must come from select regions of Greece. The expert should've pointed that out
Kate McKinnon.
You don't have to be an expert to tell which one is more expensive, you don't have to taste them. I think even an eighth year old can tell
the nastier it looks, the more expensive it is.
smh most of these seem like common sense
I’m not even an expert but I guessed it all right just by it looks lol
I'm sorry but It's not that hard I live in France and most people I know could tell you what she's telling you
They talk like they "actually didn't knew" every cheese and their price from the begining. Good acting.
Owwwww, really ?? Did you really put Irish flag instead of Italian flag next to Parmigianino regiano ??
It should be a blind taste test because seeing the cheese she made her decisions, and tasters have to be so superior.  🙄
Thank you i didnt know parmigiano reggiano was irish
Me: watching an internet video of a well educated girl, cutting the cheese...
4:03 its 3x more expensive, not 5 lmao
Fresh cheese smells like milk though
The fancy goat cheese wasn’t 5x as expensive, it was slightly over 3x as expensive.
Why did they show the outside of the cheeses, pointless exercise, you then easily tell difference
φετουλα
1:18 I'm gonna pretend i did not hear nothing.
If anyone is looking for an eating expert, feel free to contact me.
There's an expert for everything.
I could tell literally EVERY expensive cheese *instantly* before she even started speaking just from looking... visual answer. And I'm a complete cheese no0b. It was quite obvious..
1:17 "this one is totally different" *FARTS*
Tbh I could probably do this
omg american pronunciation is HORRIBLE in every fckn way when they name foreign stuff. HORRIBLE it even seems like that u Americans don’t even try to pronounce words right…it’s really representing the American plastic lifestyle arrogance 🥴
Bruh , I missread the "cheese expert" to "Chinese expert"
Party cheese haha, I be eatin that stuff on the side as a snack. Peasants. Didn't even get into the unpasteurised washed rind cheeses. Can't beat a good Époisses, Langres or Taleggio
I think all French people is cheese expert!!! No need for an expert to say all what she said!!! No surprise that Americans need to be teach about cheese… lol
Skyler eating cheese and Flynn shootting.
Are her eyes purple?
I wonder if she likes peneasian cheese heh
Love those protein crystals but didn't know that's what they were until now. Thanks!!
I feel uncomfortable with the way she pronounces parmigiano reggiano hahah. But dang, my mouth was watering just watching this
Let's be honest, You don't really need to be an expert in cheese to tell which will be more expensive..
1:18 did someone farted?
Not sure what cheese is the cheap version when it came to the bleu, but she was right on the money with the expensive one (no pun intended).  That is Rogue River from Rogue Creamery.  That is an organic Syrah leaf on the outside which has been soaking in an organic pear spirit liquor.  I worked for Rogue Creamery and that is definitely a very labor intensive product but is definitely THE best cheese in the world.  It is worth the price WHEN you find the right wheel.  Since it’s an organic, hand made cheese, you can get some that aren’t amazing and there is no rhyme or reason.  However, when you find the perfect one…there is simply no other cheese in the world that compares nor competes.  I hated working for them but that cheese is DAMN good.
I don't think she really needed to taste them; she knew everything just by looking! She just wanted to eat cheese.
Soap expert!
What a beautiful cheese expert. Sorry its just unexpected.
1:18 fart?
Home girl must have some rank gas after doing videos like these 😷
Lol I guess that makes me a cheese expert because I can easily tell the difference between expensive and cheap cheeses
How bored you must be to become a cheese expert? 💀
Of all things human beings have accomplished, cheese is easily in the top 10
Remember: Sleep is important
Does it taste weird and pungent? Then it's expensive, tada.
Please stop allowing the experts to look at what they are comparing in these Cheap vs. Expensive videos. I need to hear what they say on mouth feel and taste only.  I am sure that they can often identify the items simply by looking at them. Blind taste tests please.
Are the colours on my monitor way off or  did they put the Irish flag on there? 2:27
*screams in french*
Cheap, ignorant, sloppy American cheeses.  The difference stands out!
I wonder if she can discern the subtle differences between traditional and American made  Venezuelan beaver cheeses
Gouda cheese should be pronounced with an H instead of a G.....
Should out to her , very educated.
obvious choices... and she really could have checked how to pronounce "parmigiano reggiano".
Next she should try maggot cheese 🪰 🧀
Ive been in the parmigiano regiano factory and aging room its so cool!
Rogue River blue, Bleu Mont bandaged cheddar, and Cowgirl Creamery Triple Cream are my three top choices.
Rogue River Blue is the real deal. That stuff is so good. I don't generally love blue cheese but it's so smooth and the flavor is just amazing.
Ehh i can’t trust an “expert” who doesn’t always go with parmigiano reggiano
She finna be stopped up for days smh
She is amazing! Knows her stuff but is humble, doesn’t hate on the accessible cheap options… when I grow up and become a cheese expert I want to be like her
The second one does not look anything like brie. Not the right rind, shape, coulor...........
Basically if a cheese looks ugly it is costlier
She is incorrect in saying that only two cheeses are wrapped in leaves. The most notable are Rogue River Blue Cheese (seen here) and Valdeon from Spain, but there are many more. I haven't tried the Rogue, but the Valdeon is amazing in small amounts (when I first tried it, it was the best blue I ever tried). It is intensely salty and acidic, so eating more than a taste will probably not be too pleasant.
a Gruyere cheese without holes!!
If she develops a lactose intolerance would that be considered a career ending injury similar to an athlete tearing their achilles?
No one: Girl with blindfold: *THAT'S GOOD CHEESE*
nutrition ... not price !
i hate cheese and don’t know anything about it and i only guessed one wrong just by looking at them, definitely don’t need to be an expert to guess this
If these videos have taught me anything, it’s that I too am an expert on many types of food, as you can nearly always guess the more expensive one just by looking at them
ooooo i want to be a cheese expert 🤩
what is a lb?
Is she a vegan? 🤔
I miss this series sooooo much!!!
1:18 Fart
When do we get a video on the Expert Expert?
Umm I have a solid  cheese phobia... So it's weird to watch people eat cheese 😐
3:19 - Well, you shouldn't be talking with  mouth full of food.. it's rude and bad manners. :P Maybe you should listen to the cheese.
I can’t believe I just watched this whole thing she is a wonderful speaker lol
The light library microscopically flow because produce crucially enter within a noxious grease. striped, dashing cream
Yes, this aged cheese is more labor intensive, thus more expensive... we had to sit it on a shelf and wait.
I feel like this woman could solve a murder just by the cheese the killer ate
My ballz smell like Parmesan cheese
I love her
so no one is going to talk about the guy farting on set at 1:20
Well looks like the cheese went right through her 1:18
It's too obvious lol
Wish I could give her my cheese 😩
Other cultures: No we have to make cheese this way!!  America: hey let’s go to the heart attack restaurant and drink butter smoothies
Imagine being a lactose intolerant cheese expert
I know nothing abt cheese i dont even like cheese but here i am at 2:37am watching intensely
Why am i here? Why did i watched? *I dont even like cheese*
Lets all just ignore how many times she cut the cheese during this production. 🍑💨🧀🔪
hi
Rind is a got way to say fungus
I just spent 11 minutes and 19 seconds learning about cheese and I don’t regret it
Dont you have to be European to be a cheese expert?
i literally know nothing about cheese and i got all of these right. what does that mean?
How does one major in cheese studies
Hi, I’m Renata Bliss, and I’m your freestyle dance teacher
I’m so sick of watching other people live out my dreams
Would have been nice to get all the cheese's names
“Cheese expert” truly the dream.
Chesse lol
laughs in french
I want to see a version of this but they’re all cheap cheeses and we get to see which ones are actually goodish
if it looks ugly, its the expensive one. There you go, yall are cheese experts now.
Yooooooooo WHO is rn on vacation in italy and 20 km away from Bologna and 5 km from the best parmesan in the world
her: "it's got lots of fruity flavors" whenever I taste different cheese: *"hmmm it's cheese"*
7million people watched a video all about chees. Love it
why am i watching this. i hate cheese
How can I get paid to eat cheese ?
If she says fruity one more time😤 jk😂
I have to ask her which she prefers more tho
I feel like I got all of these right cuz they were so easy 🤣. But maybe I just have a good guesser
i got them all exept one
Should have messed with her and flipped the cards so the cheap one says it’s expensive
This lady walks around in a fart cloud lol
I could literally watch her educate me about cheeses for hours
Did anyone else hear the fart?
¿I am the only one who noticed that they used the Irish flag instead of the Italian one?
i want to have this job
Why is this so entertaining
this made me want cheese
Its 2am and I'm learning about cheese
The fact i got all of them right by just looking at them
They should of had her do this with a blind fold and just tasted them
I should be a cheese expert i knew all of these lol
The more gross looking cheese is always the more expensive one.
so that's what Kate McKinnon did after SNL.
I love how she pretends she doesnt know just by looking at it 😭🤚😂
With the Swiss alpine cheese they say that European cheese makers receive subsidies from the EU, but Switzerland isn’t part of the EU….
lmao I don't even like cheese and I think I've eaten maybe 3 kinds. I could tell just by looking at them and it's funny how she acts like she didn't know as soon as she looked at it
did they really mixed up the irish and italian flag?
the only similarities that cheese and I have is that both are dusty, crusty, and musty.
Why did they have Ireland’s flag on the first fancy Parmesan
Her eyes are like purple 😍😍😍
Okay but, even for a non cheese expert it's easy lmao
1:18 that’s was a fart?
Blue cheese has mold in it
Some people: Moldy cheese.... yum 😋  Germaphobe: *runs*
Yeah she from Wisconsin
How do you even become a cheese expert.
I keep thinking this is an SNL skit with Kate McKinnon with the thumbnail, even though I've watched this video before.
The fact that an "american parmesan" is contemplated when the name parmigiano (parmesan) literally means "from Parma" which is a city in Italy is tragicomic
I already know that whole room smelled bad
special party cheese! hahahaha first world problems.
if its very smellier its expensive
I wasn't aware these food experts exist 😂😂 sounds fine... I might grow up to be  chocolate expert
This is the equivalent of saying "Math expert does 1+1"
I think Ik what I wanna be now
i wonder how many times cheese was said in this video
I could pick this woman out of a crowd and know that she is a cheese expert
SMELLS KINDA NUTTY
Imgaine if she fails that would be sooo bad.💅
I'm no expert but I could easily tell which was more expensive just by looks
How do I become a chease expert?
I really enjoyed this video it was super interesting
I got all them right except except the blue cheese
After this my toilet would be sad 🚽🧻🧻🧻🧻🔥🔥
I’ll personally cry if she’s not from Wisconsin.
I think they should try this again with someone who just likes cheese 👍
While this is neat, I think it was too easy.  I think a non-cheese expert would get most of these right, just from watching the video I got all but the feta right just by visual appearance alone.
7:22 That's what she said😁
Just me who knew all of them by just looking at them
tbh you don’t even need to be a cheese expert in order to know which cheese is the expensive one.
Should’ve blind folded her
Ngl French people average people have almost as much expertise as this American cheese expert
Cheddar?????????
Ok what I understood is that the uglier cheese is the most expensive alright
Is everyone ignoring the fact that they used the flag from Ireland instead of the flag from Italy?
GOD BLESS IN JESUS NAME🙏🏽✝️
Uuuu i wanns eat cheese but im lactose intolerant.
“This Feta, tastes totally different” *as they show the same shot of her grabbing the first one*
This is my calling in life, got all of them right!!!
Does she have purple eyes?
Right off the bat
When she started going on about the cows being grass fed it reminded me of the time I went to this mom and pop owned restaurant and this waiter had the audacity to be like “today’s special is our top quality sirloin from our *corn fed* cows” like *SIR* ... do you think I’m dumb?
she looks like a cheese expert
Ugh I wish I was a cheese expert 😫
Skill is not needed in this video
Dude I like that mini clever just so cute looks like a mini serial killer would use
Moral of the video: the more ugly and smelly the cheese is, the more expensive it is.
She makes these cheeses sound nasty saying it taste like biting into a crayon or that it has a texture of dough
2:20
She knows her stuff, that I can’t argue
h-how do you become a known cheese expert?
1:18 I heard a fart anyone else did?
It cost that much cause it takes me f*cking hours lol
Glad to see that Claire from Modern Family managed to find a new job after the series was over.
That's really funny that I realized today that I'm a cheese expert only because I'm french ...
why did i just watch a woman talk about cheese for 11 minutes
I got all but one right.. I am now a cheese expert😏
So the nastier looking cheese the expensive it is? 🤣
Cool cheese and stuff, but what the hell are those knives?
Cheese smells concentrated means It smells like a hundred year old wet foot on socks...
i must be a cheese expert too, i guessed them alright
1:18 is that a fart? HAHAHA
Truely expert
Wow, watched the whole thingy .
idk y but she looks really identical to caroline forbes's mother liz forbes from vampire diaries.
Parmigiano Regiano is my favorite type of cheese. I could tell it was the more expensive at the first one just by looking. I'm not too good with cheese types, but I'd know my favorite cheese anywhere.
“hey what do you do for a living?” “cheese expert.” “…”
The way she pronounces Gouda cracks me up.
me after eating 20 cheeses "you know, I'm some what of an expert myself"
A cheese expert you say… that seems like my kind of job
Idk why I’m watching this I don’t even like cheese lol
Alright, so darker cheese means more expensive
Can we talk about her eyes? They are like Elizabeth Taylor’s violet eyes ✨
I'm a cheese expert at 1 in the morning.
I'm proud of myself that I got all these right even though it was obvious
I don't know anything about cheese, I think cheddar is a type of cheese, I think. Anyway, I guessed correctly with all these.
Is cheese experts paid? I didn’t know it even existed
I love the fact that it gets uglier as it gets cheeper
Can I go on this show? Please… Cause I’m a sleeping expert!!!   Lol does that even make sense 😵‍💫
Umm is that a flag of Ireland i see by the parmigiano-reggiano?
Any idiot could guess these cheeses and which is the most expensive. If she's a professional cheese expert then I'm a super duper rocket scientific researchistic cheesy amazing wow balls professional cheese expert 😂😂😂😂
I watch this atleast twice a year this is so satisfying.
I love how she analyzes factors and information to guess which is expensive. She's good at what she does
my lactose intolerant stomach is crying
Even I can tell the one that is more than expensive by looking at it. Should have been done  blind.
Kate McKinnon hits this longform improv so hard
If someone starts using their hands and fingers like that I know they’re into what they’re talking about. Idk how else to explain it but it’s true.
i was just waiting for camembert
Me being* lactose intolerant: 👁👄👁 yuh
*Watching this while eating a whole block of feta cheese* Like what do you study to fit the job? my cheese lover self is suddenly interested
she looks like brienne of tarth
I want to be her.
Cheese is worth buying the expensive stuff. With things like cheddar you don’t need to get the really fancy stuff but making sure it’s good is important but anything else it’s important
Gurl your my idol- im addicted to cheese so- yeah-
Im not cheese expert but I knew all of these. I think it’s easy for anyone that loves cooking/buying nice ingrediants. You always have the ‘obvious’ industrial look and organic/home-made one that is almost always more expensive.
My lactose intolerant stomach could never 😂😂😂😂
She was guessing that it was younger.... Wasn't that hard to tell..
Okay I got all of these right just by looking… I’m sure she was easily able to tell which was fake and which one wasn’t 😂
skyler?
If i were there i would answer the darker is more expensive😭
its so obvious its annoying
I love this video so much
I enjoyed this video quite a bit 🤗🤗🤗👌🏽
I'm too poor to appreciate the taste of fancy cheese. I just know I wouldn't like any of these
is it just me or does she give off kristen wiig vibes ahah
what r u doin here claire dunphy?
Well, at the end of this video you will find yourself with two things:  1) A Watering Mouth 2) A PHD on Cheese.
So I have 1 female goat (getting another female in the next 6 weeks) and twins on the way (might be females not sure) so your saying if I make goat cheese and let it age for 4-8 weeks I could get lots of money... 😈
Imagine messing up with the italian Flag, labeling the Parmigiano Reggiano as an Irish cheese... smh
darker cheese=old cheese=more expensive
she makes cheese look so tasty
She really looks like a cheese expert
idk if it’s because i’m french, but i guessed all of these correctly
2:55 looks like worms 🤢
She's like the Sherlock Holmes of cheese
Imagine calling yourself an expert on milk of another species ew Milk isnt from cows its from mothers if you would not suck it yourself or drink the milk of your dog maybe think about how weird this is
2:27 🇮🇪 is that an ireland flag??
More disgusting taste,more expensive.
People who eat cheese for fun freak me out
Can someone please tell me the name of music at the beginning and at 5:05 ?
how do you become a cheese expert? asking for a friend
think the last one is cornish yarg wrapped in nettles
You don't have to be a cheese expert to work out which is more expensive just by looking at them...
Sorry cheese what?😂. Cheese expert?😂😂😂
I think the point of this video was basically for her to prove she knows her stuff by getting all of them right! I actually enjoyed the video I am not a huge fan of cheese but I'm just fascinated how it's made how it doesn't go old so I definitely learned alot about cheese watching this video so thanks for that
Cheesy.
2:24 Irish flag instead of Italian lol
Basically, the raunchier it looks, the more expensive it is.
if she hasn't tried the forbidden cheese then she's not an expert
Cheese expert that pronounced half of the names wrong.
This video makes me want to go eat cheese now
1:18 Did she fart ?
So moldy cheese is expensive
Well thats not italian flag
2:25 Irish flag??
I like cheese
I think you could do an entire episode on Blue Cheeses: stillton, Danish, French, gorgonzola, special layered cheeses like Colby Stilton, or cambazola😋
they should have had her do a blind tasting because obviously an aged cheese is more expensive.
Wife of Gil Thorpe lol
Crying in lactose intolerance
The way she says parmigiano reggiano makes me cringe
Great content, I came here to learn more about wine and now I also know more about cheese. Which is sad because I only have access to processed cheese where I live 🥲
how does one exactly become a cheese expert asking for a friend
I wish she would’ve said “honestly the more medieval it looks the better the quality”
so basically the older it looks, the more expensive it is
I love how Liz has natural "suprised meme eyes" when she reacts to each taste
Her eyes look violet to me...
Smell this cheese *rolls back foreskin*
She probably smells terrible
Ew
Well apparently I am a cheese expert because I learned absolutely nothing from this video. Didn’t know I was such a connoisseur!
I bet she knows whats more expensive from first sight but she wants to taste it
Skyler from breaking bad made a big transition after the finale
as I'm studyig for my CCSE and realising I can Identify these cheeses by sight is making me feel way less stressed. but that Rogue River blue is iconic and if she didn't know it right off I would have had questions.
theres something her being a cheese expert that makes me feel uneasy, i mean its just awkward... whatever
cheese 5head
Love you liz❤️ You can thorpe on me anytime ❤️
is cheese sensitive
am i the only one who absolutely dislikes cheese and watches this?
I watched whoopty once and this is what I get recommended
All cheese(s) are paid actors !
Where is a potato expert???
Ok but nothing beats shredded cheese at 2 am.
How does one become a cheese expert
Imagine being a cheese expert
Makes me want some cheese 🤤🤤
So cheese is all about patents?
1:18 Did the cameraman just fart? I'm using headphones so the sound was very obvious, apparently no one in the comments heard that.
Hot and loves cheese = winner :)
Why is there no chalkboard drawing?
Oh well another food expert/snob. Any food, if you enjoy it, is not wrong.
The only that i could not tell  the expensive one was feta, maybe because i never ate feta in my life
"what do you want to be when you grow up?"  "a cheese expert"
*C H E E S E*
these cheese knifes are fire
As a European in ameirca, I'll always choose to support European cheese. Obviously. And there is no comparison as far as quality and taste.
Does anyone know what her set of knives - I really want to buy this set!
Parmigiano Reggiano is also lactose-free
I watch one video of a woman slicing cheese and now I have all these cheese videos being recommended
I adore that she didn't trash the cheaper cheese.
🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷
I’m a cheese fan. I love the Spice Girls 😍
What’s the point of this if they aren’t comparing the same types of cheese?
Calling yourself a cheese expert and saying that you don’t feel the difference between beautiful Parmiggiano Reggiano and this american made crap is kinda laughable
its kinda funny because some of us without knowing anything about cheese can se which one is more expensive
she looks like a cheese stick
2:24 can we talk about the fact that this is Ireland’s flag ?
*this is my DREAM job*
Well the Flag on the first cheese is wrong, That is the flag of Ireland
"Goat's cheese, like a brie style."  Please hand in your weapon and badge, leave all your personal belongings here, you're fired.
We need a poop expert where they eat pieces of poop and guess what animal it came from 😂😂
Too easy I work in cheese I’d say I’m a cheese expert also, and just by looking at them you can tell which cheese it is. They should have done it blind folded
After watching the "How to prepare every cheese" video, I can now recognize these cheeses by looking and understand everything she says.
if anyone was wondering what the expensive blue cheese was, it’s called Rogue River Blue. it’s the blue cheese that helped me to stop hating blue cheese :)
i want this job
I wonder what they do with the rest of the cheeses after shooting...🤔
Hi I'm Dr.sandflea and I'm an expert on watching weird cheese videos and this is indeed a cheese video
I wonder when she realised that she wanted to be a cheese expert  🤔🤔
This was dumb. I could have guessed just by looking at them too and I know nothing about cheese. Should have done blind tests based on taste only
Im pretty sure she already knew which one is more  expensive just by looking at them. She just pretend like she doesnt know so she get to taste them 😆
After watching how to cut every cheese, I can visually identify the more expensive cheese here
What a strange job eating cheese for a living
Is it just me or does the parmesano reggiano flag says it’s from Ireland?
why am i watching this? *i don’t even eat cheese*
Why doesn't she identify the cheeses?  Worthless as an educational video.
Okay I’m sorry but this was a little too easy for her I know nothing about cheese and by looking at them I knew which ones were the expensive one...we need it to be a little more even
Does someone know what’s the cheapest cheese?
One can find good cheese without spending a fortune.  One trick to get a really good cheddar is to buy, at your local US supermarket, the common Cracker Barrel brand sharp cheddar, except leave it unopened for 24 hours at room temperature.  The improvement will be dramatic.
Can't believe she said Parmigiano-Reggiano wrong just 45 seconds in, she's a self proclaimed cheese expert I would not trust her with my cheese.
That is the flag from Ireland!
4.02 its not 5 Times as expensive, the first is 4 per 4oz. And the second 20 per 6oz. The first one would cost 6 per 6oz.
The more weird food is , the more expensive it is
My guess is that the leaf-wrapped blue is a Rogue River. It's too light-colored for a Valdeon.
The knives are so cute 👀
I really didn't liked vibes from her TBH
Why tf am I watching this?
she should have been blind folded
I just keep going back to watch this over and over again.
I dont think i need to be a cheese expert to know which one is expensive 😁
So she was "guessing?" I got all but the feta correct with 2 years deli employee experience, thats IT.... Talk about a set up XD easy stuff here..
When someone asks me what i want to be when i grow up, i always don't know what to say. But now i think i want to be a cheese expert bcs i luv cheese lmao.
I literally called every single one right, its not even that hard to know what cheese is more expensive wtf
for a cheese expert she is horrible at cutting it
Okay, I got all of them right... Without even tasting 🤚🏽😭
Bruh, I was watching some good Hololive clips, how the hell did I ended up searching "Cheese review"?
Cheese, one of those foods that gets more expensive the nastier it gets
Ah Liz I’m from Wisconsin😌✋
I'm npt cheese expert but I can tell that just by the look
“What do you do for a living?”   “I’m an expert in cheese...”  “👁👄👁”  “...👀...”
Nobody’s gonna mention how cute the knives were?
It would be a white person being a cheese expert 🤣🤣🤣
Idk anything abt cheese but I can tell by just looking at them which one was more expensive.
i love alpine style cheese
Right off the bat, I really enjoyed the video
Im gonna become a professional cheese cutter.   I will be the BEST at cutting the cheese.  Mark my words
As a Greek, I'll tell you this: any """"feta"""" outside of Greece isn't feta. Because it has to meet really certain criteria.
Yeah, I'm gonna become a cheese expert. I definitely won't eat every single cheese out there on my own **wink wink**
The fact that parmigiano reggiano came from ireland according to the flag
So, the uglier the better?
Pfft. I am very good at this when it come to water.
I am not a cheese expert, but could tell each one, just by looks. Cheese, like chocolate tells a story with color and texture.
Funny how i got them all right just by their looks
*THE KNIFE. THE CHEESE KNIFE.*
So the blue in the cheese is just mold💀
editing mistake... with the feta the one that smells like olives is the one to her right... you guys edited it as if it was the cheese on her left.
me being lactose intolerant: hm yes i think i'll click this video that is miles down from the top of my recommended.....
The fact that this is not my first time watching it
i'm lactose intolerant why am i watching this
Ive never tasted American cheese !! I really want to try it out. Especially the last expensive bleu
Is it just me or does that flag for the Italian cheese look Irish?
1 Fun fact and 1 important fact! Rats arent crazy about cheese as everyone sees them as. They actually prefer stuff like sunflower seeds over cheese. MOST CATS become lactose intolerant after breast feeding months! Keep this in mind while filling up a bowl for street animals please.
_parmiğïaňó rejìãnø_
Soap people  Knife people Cheese people YES
Blue cheese is disgusting 🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮
Is she Valyrian?
I wish they went in touch more about the origins or the blue cheeses
If the cheese is made by cow's milk or is produced outside of Greece then it's not feta by law cause it is a Pop (product with specific characteristics that comes from a certain area of the world) item. Basically the USA is violating the law by calling it feta. The correct term is "white cheese" (lefko tiri). That is what we call everything that is wayyyyyyy to cheap and/or awfully made and/or by cow's milk. Actually "white cheese" is frowned upon and cheap and mostly bought by immigrants that can't afford real feta or think that they are the same think. Very few Greeks would actually buy "white cheese" by choise and constantly like they do with real feta
The feta cheese was cap. She sounded like she liked B until she had to choose, then she randomly changed her opinion to A for no reason
I love cheese SO MUCH, but to this day I cannot touch blue cheese and I cant wrap my head around it
I am really impressed by her skills, no doubt. But please stop pronouncing Parmegiano Reggiano like Parmeshan Reshiano.
6.7million people: I'm interested
The flag on the price tag for the parmigiano reggiano is that of Ireland though, not Italy
She looks so much like Miranda from Sex and the City 😯
Am I the only one who sees her eyes look purple sometimes?
This i my 15th time watching this video in the last 4 days
Cheese expert op
02:56 that cheese is so ugly omg i wanna cry
Claire Dunphy
Im so lactose intolerant that just watching this video made me gassy
As a French person, I guessed all of them right the second the cheeses were shown
She doesn't look like she eats cheeze as a job
Really good to have someone who is an expert without being snobby
I would have kept eating that blue cheese during the whole explanation xD
I could’ve guessed all by just looking at it lmaooo I need to become a cheese expert
Didn't know skyler was a cheese expert
i really dont know how but i got them all rights except for feta just by looking at them
Nem de queijo eu gosto, mas estou aqui hahaha
Not a cheese expert and i guessed them all right anyway :P
Did she try both feta?
Not gonna lie, this is at least my 5th time watching and i will be back
1:18 did she just fart
GUDA?
Am I the only one who noticed the Irish flag next to the Parmigiano Reggiano?  Better change that before the Italians see lol.
Always buy feta in block form with brine!  Not dry crumbles! Greek cheese is always the best!
My Lactose Intolerance is screaming
Can someone ask her if she’s lactose intolerant? I need to know the bowel situation
what my mom thinks I watch when I lock my door: 🅱️entai what I actually watch:
Didnt know it was a real job
aged in plastic... a great metaphor for where the cheese came from
clue: the grossest moldy cheese the expensive it would take
6:50  “Pretty much anyone would look at these and say oh it’s feta cheese” Wow this woman is in an entirely different league HAHAHAHA I had no idea :)
Wine tasting...but cheese
mom i know what i want ti study for now
Eat a piece of feta cheese and follow it down with a piece of watermelon, thank me once you've tasted heaven .
Blue cheese has mold in it.
She farts at 1:17
I love how as a french, I know all of this and I’m always right even if I know nothing about cheese view from french people
Her: i’m a cheese expert  Lactose intolerants: 👁💧👄💧👁
and I'm your freestyle dance teacher
Imagine her making a cheese board
what i got from this is, the uglier the cheese, the more expensive it is
im not a cheese expert, but i can even tell which is the expensive cheese js
I keep looking at this woman's eyes. Are they really that color!?
Wtf am I watching this
did no one notice the flag was wrong on the first card? it's meant to be italian but it's irish
I better see some babybel cheese
5:36 my mom when she saw me
Parmigiano-reggiano can only be made in Italy.  They used the Irish flag instead of the Italian one...
So what your saying is I’m a cheese expert to
Idk why I’m watching this. I’m allergic to dairy. But I’m watching it sooo thanks YT algorithm
I wonder what her sweat smells like
My parents: u can become whatever u want when u grow up Me: CheEsE ExPerT
Seems easy
I LOVE CHEEEEESEEEE!!!!!
I honestly can’t believe people eat blue cheese on purpose. Without being held at gun point. And enjoy it.
Why did my lactose intolerant self watch this whole thing?
If you’re a cheese expert is that an actual job like do you get paid guap for being a expert
This is the whitest video I’ve ever seen-
Wow! Astounding violet eyes!  Ps I love cheese 🥰
4:07 ah excuse me B is SIX ounces-
Liz Lemon approves the name of this cheese expert
literally my favorite videos on the internet. Give her a TV show or something I'd watch it.
Where is the french cheese ?
I wanna know w h y she’s an expert
Parmejiano rejiano
Im confused on why im watching this
Man: So what do you do for a living? Her: oh im a cheese expert Man:👁👄👁
Should've blindfolded her.
Bro I would never eat aged cheese like ew
This is my lactose intolerant friends dream job
What have we learned people? If it has a rind/skin than its more expensive , if it looks darker than it is more expensive
I feel like I want to be friends with her
Being european i feel bad, knowing all the expensive ones (except the grier ones) because they are completely normal here...
This is the whitest thing ever
ngl they seemed obvious but would only be random guesses lol
I never imagined that one could feed grass to milk. 6:20 mark.
She's definitely got some Claire Dunphy vibes from Modern Family
I like to imagine she knows all the answers from looking at them but just wants to taste all the cheese. . . cuz I would too
I got like all of them right based off which ones a haven't seen in my fridge :''D
I got all of them right just by looking at them before she judged them😌😌
moral of the video: American=cheap
Wait. Cheese expert is a thing?! As much as I LOVE cheese, where can I sign up for this career?! Lmao
I worked in a deli for a while and I feel very proud of myself for knowing all this random useless information lmfao
Imagine she finds out she’s lactose intolerant...
SKYLER WHITE
So darker is more expensive got it
I love how she pretends she doesnt  know just by looking at it.
Did they use the irish flag for the first cheese??
I love cheese but I’m lactose intolerant
What profession exactly is a cheese expert? What does she do?
No chalkboard art in these early ones??  *GASP* 😱
c h e e s e
Stranger: So what do you do for a living? This chick: Cheese expert. Stranger:
No offense or anything but first two were a lil obvious by looks
I'm all about that walmart brand american cheese. Cheap = best.
I'd like to try Liz's...uh, cheese. I'm sure she's pretty tasty.
I hate that she says Parmigiano right and then says "Reggie-ano"
@1:18
Well, to be fair, most of the expensive cheeses gave away their price just by the fact you could see they were aged for a longer time. So you don't really need to be an expert on that. It would have been more legitimate if all the cheeses had been cut into cubes of similar sizes, straight from the middle, with no rind.
How do you know what it feels like to eat a crayon
Why does she got to cut soo big chunks and slices but take only a small bite? The rest of the piece probably goes to waste.
I'm a chicken expert
Who else got a wierd craving for cheese lol
1:18 did she... fart?
I wish epicurious would do more expert guessing prices of stuff
Hi, this is Sigourney Weaver, & you are watching Alien Cheese.
Which ever ate last seemed to be the the more expensive... hmmmmmm interesting
Next up crackheads try to figure which cocaine is more pure
I hope one day I'll be referred to as a "cheese expert" 🧀
I got dairy-free cheese by accident, and I almost died from eating it. Horrendous.
Someone: what do you want to be when you grow up? Me: _cheese expert_
This gives me Napoleon dynamite milk tasting vibes
I got them all right I could easily be an expert
You can usually tell if a cheese is more expensive based on how bad it tastes
If youre dutch you know it just by looking at it
wait is a real thing?? we had soap expert now we have cheese expert?
I don't even like cheese, but here I am.  Also, did she say they put mold in cheese, like...what??? Isn't that a bad thing? Cheese people please explain to me what's going on here
Where is the cheese in an aerosol can?
I didn't know Elizabeth Banks was a cheese expert.
This lady knows her cheese, and after watching this video, I know more, thanks!
Quest started: "Taste The Cheese and Guest The Price"  "Wait, let me check my cheese rank" "Ohh, im in expert level. This will be easy"  Quest completed: 'Taste The Cheese and Guest The Price" Reward: - Cheese  - 250 gold
Wait. WAIT.  HER NAME IS LIZ AND SHE LOVES CHEESE. And now all I can think of is, "Working on my night cheeeese." 😅
i want cheese
Mahh, i want to be a cheese expert
Nije ova probala stari sir iz sela moga dede, ne bi nista slicno u zivotu probala....
Seems i'm also a cheese expert. I guessed all of them right by their looks. :D
You messed up Italy's flag. It's green, white and red. Green, white and orange is Ireland 🤦🏽‍♂️
bro i guessed half of them
didnt need an expert to tell the one with more detail and mold is more expensive
I've yet to sleep, I have a class in 2 hours, what am I doing here...?
Where you ever just laying in bed just watching random stuff on YouTube and before you even notice it you're watching documentaries about cheese at 4 am...        Great me neither
Cheese expert, cuts the cheese wrong.
I know nothing about cheese and obviously didn't get to taste them, but still got them all right before she started speaking about them. Maybe I have a natural talent ;D
Bruh I wish I could be a cheese expert
I want to be a cheese expert too :)
Now I'm curious if she's actually bitten a crayon
Did she say it was five times more expensive? Bruh look at the ounces
3:19 Giggity
Sheep milk! Ew. Sheeps are male.
Anyone even without tasting should be able to see which one of these are cheap and expensive right away
This made me crave cheese in a way I didn’t know I could
Just pick the weirder looking one and you are right every time
1:17 did someone just fart wtf is going on
The blue cheese with the grape leaves is called Rogue River Blue from Rogue Creamery in southern Oregon. They also make one that's aged even longer called Rogue River Blue Reserve which won the "Best Cheese in the World" for 2019 at the championships in Bergamo, Italy. First time any cheese from America won this. The Syrah grape leaves are soaked in pear brandy. I've been trying to buy it for a while, but you have to be on a waiting list to buy any.
1:18 why does it sound like someone farted
If she is an expert why ia she guessing. If ur an expert u dont say crayon to describe food.   Bet u she is a SELF CLAIMED EXPERT
How do u become a cheese expert ?
Seeing her tasting those make me want to eat the CHEEESEEEE🤤
That leaf wrapped blue cheese is from Oregon, Rogue Creamery - Rogue River Blue. Won the world cheese awards competition in Italy for 2019 and 2020. Soo tasty
"It's like biting into crayons" Guess cheese lady here used to be marine then decided to pull a Bob Ross by switching to a completely different career  Joke aside, appreciate her enthusiasm and profound knowledge on cheese
All I know is cheese smells wet-sock-y and makes a burger taste more McDonald-y
CHEESE IS CHEESE  damn im hungry
What? I has been there years?
Ah yes me at 3 am
i hate blue cheese so much. just seeing it makes me so angry idk man
you just have to look at it to see which one is more expensive
So basically if the cheese is old then it's expensive
I'm a cheese expert.........  has anyone tried this as a chat up line?
All of these are expensive to me
Why did i fell in love with her?
i want to see a so-called 'expert' get everything wrong
I was able to guess all of them just by the looks. I do love cheese though... considering a career move.
Cheese expert: doesn’t notice the difference between Parmigiano and parmesan.
Water expert guesses more cheap water vs expensive water next pls!
This lady but only French cheeses from artisan fromagerie
Expert, but can’t pronounce ‘Gouda’ correctly
She looks like if someone mixed Skylar from Breaking Bad and Claire from Modern Family together.
2:25. On the sign for the Italian cheese, they used the flag of Ireland instead that of Italy.
Are we gonna talk about the knife she’s using.
Has there been a episode where they get one wrong?
I love that they made this informational as opposed to just trying to trick the expert.
Wallace needs to pick up on this
Imagine the thing you do for a living is eat cheese, it's the perfect balance of bizarre AND dream job
So stupid, like a beer expert tasting beers out of bottles with the lables removed. Most people notice the the bottles and can tell which ones expensive and which on is cheap.
The only cheese you need is cheddar.
I wanna be a cheese expert so bad now
Fart 💨 *
I like how cheese is never described as like “amazing or anything” because it’s literally different versions of spoiled milk
I guess I just like watching attractive women talk about food.
Uglier one is the most expensive got it
Can we talk about the fact they used the Irish flag instead of the Italian for Parmesan? Plus I think we all couldve told which one is the more expensive without those scientific explanation
Cheese is just hardened milk
How do I get this job
Nice work if you can get it.
500:555
gOuDa 😩😩😩 girl noooo
Is it anyone that heard domone fart 1.18 minutes in the video.
What about Richard Cheese.
I’m so glad to live in a world where there are experts in medicine,biology, Astro physics, and cheese but I mean come on who said hey you know what we need we need a cheese expert since that’s important 😂😂
"this ones the drier one; it wasnt as wet"  you dont say
Fr I think I've watched this 5 times in my recommended
Hmmmm, I might be a cheese expert.
Can we talk about how she pronounces the "Reggiano" in Parmigiano-Reggiano? The i in "Reggiano" is silent.
I wish there was also a control where just a regular person is trying it at a separate time just to see what they think
The more visually appealing cheese is the more expensive cheese
Did she fart at 1:18 ?
I hate the taste of cheese but I just can't to seem to stop watching other people making or eating one
can we get the cheese expert, meat expert, and wine expert get together and have a lavish party?
It’s literally a excuse to eat cheese lol
I like that they got an actual expert instead of someone who "really likes cheese"
Cheese
I would like a version of this, but with someone that knows absolutely nothing about cheese.
I made that feta pasta from TikTok and wondered why the Greek feta I bought was so expensive. I learned something today
I just wanna try all those cheeses 😭😭😭
it is like watching a person having a test in a class but she physically explains her answer and she nails every question
Im guessing she’s the type to know what nutrients you’re missing when she swallows
I absolutely sit around with my friends and eat cheeses
Basically, the darker the more expensive, except when it’s not.
Am I the only one who heard the fart at 1:17
Me explaining why this game is really good and saying all the reasons:  My mom  who just wanted to know why i took her credit card : 👁 👄 👁
this is so not vegan friendly
Honestly soft cheeses are superior, especially for snacking with on a nice seasoned cracker when watching movies or gaming
Tbf you can look at the cheese and already know. But she did explain incredibly well which is something I lack
"I'm Liz Thorpe and I'm a cheese expert" why is that a thing
You can easily tell by how they look and the designs lol I got all of them right too🤯 guess Ima expert
She knows exactly who made the cheese but never name dropped cos she’s not sponsored
Random person: so what do u work as? Her: oh im a cheese expert  Random person: ah....cool...thats uhm.... great 😅 Her: indeed it is :)
1:18 nice fart
I'm so sick of hearing, "grass-fed beef." Cows are ruminant meaning they can only survive on a diet of grass. If there is non grass-fed beef, the cow's owner is essentially killing it slowly.
Who else.came from the man opening a big wheel of cheese video
Yes. Now I too can tell that the best cheeses are more expensive just by knowing they are ‘fancy party cheeses’
This is super interesting
Cheese experts hot
For most of these I can tell at one glance
The knife is given me anxiety, and I don't know why.
Me: im gonna go to bed early tonight Also me @ 1am:
Anyone else heard the fart at 1:17-1:19?
Cheap or not, Cheese is cheese and cheese is tasty
did anyone else hear the fart at 1:18 ? XD
The leaf that the blue cheese is wrapped in looks like grape leaves
if it looks gross it’s probably more expensive
"Parmigiano Reggiano"  *Shows flag of Ireland instead of Italy
I could tell that she is a cheese expert by looking at her
The more disgusting a cheese looks, the more expensive lol
2:27 maybe I’m just colourblind but isn’t the  flag on the left the Irish flag and not the Italian ?
After watching this video, I felt my Borden cheddar-eating peasantry leave my body. I'm ready to drink my coffee with my pinky finger sticking out!
I miss Price Points so much.
Her analogys were on point
Have you tried bull milk cheese yet?
Does anyone know, is the blue cheese wrapped in the vine leaf a Rogue River special reserve blue ? If only they revealed what names of the cheeses were.
who?
as a poor person do you ever just sigh in envy when someone says that they grate one of the world's most expensive cheeses over salad
Love this woman, I will marry her in my next life.  I would have loved to see the names of these cheeses though, i.e. who produced them.
did they put the Irish flag instead of the Italian?
Imagine she picks the wrong cheese and hulks out
"It's like bitting into a crayon"  What she just say? You're telling me you ate-wha
She lost credibility with me when she said she prefers Parmesan over the real Parmigiano-Reggiano. Also her pronunciation of the latter is so cringe. This is how it should be pronounced! https://youtu.be/N1CoabrDlec
Would have been better as blind tasting, visual ques give a lot away.
1:26 enjoy the view
I thought that was Claire Dunphy when I just saw the thumbnail
That parmesan cheese looks so yellow I almost couldn't recognize it
Cant hardly get any good cheese in the US due to our dumb regulations on raw and unpasteurized foods 😣
I can tell, She love her job so much 😂
Maybe its her hair but she looks like what a cheese expert should look like
I would love to talk to her more about cheese for 10 hours straight no cap
so the ugly cheese is the expensive cheese
Good cheese vs American cheese
These cheeses are rich people's guilty pleasure.
1:18 do you hear the fart or is it just me ????!!!
go follow her youtube channel “the people’s cheese”, she only has 1.5k
literally don’t eat cheese at all but here I am
1:18 Am i the only one who heard a fart?
More gross looking = more expensive 😂
Wait. At 7:25 & 7:33 u cut it to make it look like she was trying out the same cheese two times. So A was the one that smells like olives i assume?
I learned so much
Fun fact : Theres a thing called Cheese expert.
4:00 nooo its not 5 times more expensive smh 🤦🤦 its 3 1/3 times more expensive
She has mesmerising eyes!
Moral of the story: the uglier the cheese the higher the cost
Can we get a chicken nugget expert in for an episode?
Lesson: the more crap it looks, the more expensive the cheese
It’s easy to tell. The one with less vibrant colours or more looks more old or disgusting is the expensive one
Basically, uglier it looks, tastier and pricer it is.
Ngl I thought of this as soon as I saw the title Kid 1:I wanna be a cop Kid 2 :I wanna be a firefighter Her: I wanna be an edacational cheese expert which can tell every type of cheese
This was really impressive
Mom: what do you want to be when you grow up? Me: 👁👄👁
A real artist decorated that chalk board behind her
i just go mmmmmmmm what is that its good
Is that rogue river blue? Holy smokes those are amazing!
The two factors that make cheese more expensive are how much it tastes like barf, and how much it tastes like fungus. Typically, fungus is a more prized taste in cheese. Cheeses that taste like someone barfed and mold grew on top of it are the most expensive of all.
3:33 I think the farmer is milking the wrong place
Is she proof of cheese= youth?
Why doesn’t she just cut smaller cheese pieces instead of wasting them?
Awe it's Feta. I thought it's Feather 😂 Hahaha
bro i swear if the world ends i can’t live without cheese
I searched “professional cheese tasters” after boxtrolls for some reason
my dream job
I just guessed them (from tge looks) and i got almost all of them right 😅
Me preparing for finals week by knowing that darker yellow = grass fed cows
A expert.. she thought the first one could be gouda. Hahahaha, you stupid
as someone from switzerland im sitting here like °O° when she reveals a more expensive, american gruyere! i want to taste it now :D
Wait a minute... Are you copying Good Mythical Morning????
You make feta with cow s milk? You could never sell that here in Greece as feta. I mean there is no way that thing tastes anything close to the real deal.
I hate these worthless videos. Literally anyone can tell cheap from expensive, but she can't tell the difference in price because the value is arbitrary. That blue cheese comparison is the best example. No one was surprised that the older, fancier cheese was more expensive, but an expert would be able to tell you the price difference and explain exactly why that difference exists.
Why would someone eat salted crayon?
Wait there are cheese EXPERTS!?
Imagine Finishing College After All That Hard Work. Just To Become An Cheese Expert
since when is mrs. Dumphy a cheese expert
1:08 did you hear it guys? ;  )
So basicly old is expensive, no expert needed.
Moral of the story: older cheese is more expensive
🤣🤣🤣
Thought title said “Chinese expert guesses cheap vs expensive cheese”
$4 for 4oz compared to $20 for 6oz is not 5X. She may be smart and super knowledgeable about cheese but with math skills like that I hope she doesn’t run a business. 😂  Sorry, the math nerd in my head doesn’t know how to shut up.
She's like the white version of emmymadeinjapan
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! when she cuts the goat chezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
My dad: watches this video Also him: CHEESE IS CHEE-
"cheese people"
Meanwhile India : cheese is cheese. There is no difference 😂
this is the best type of expertise.
She's so awesome! 😃
Wait, does she eat cheese for a living? I want her job.
At least this chick just proved she’s good at her job.  Nailed it.
so you could call the younger ages blue cheese a... baby blue?
how does one become a cheese expert
Imagine a cheese expert becoming lactose intolerant
i don't even like cheese. i hate cheese. and hate is a strong word.
You searched up cheese, and so did I
Ugly means expensive
Her pronunciation of “Gouda” nearly killed me... (I’m Dutch)
I salute her
Help I have a crush on this cheese lady
It’s all fun and games until she eats ur Shmegma
I wish this was my job
I feel like this was entirely obvious
...why is salty crayon cheese more expensive than candy like cheese?
did they really put the Irish flag instead of the Italian flag 💀
ima just sit here eating plastic cheese slices
2:24 they really just put and ireland flag instead of an italian flag 😂😂😂
What do you wanna be when you grow up? Me: a cheese expert
I can usually tell the price after the third wheel
Happy that Skyler White be doing good with cheese after Heisenberg died
Black Diamond 3year aged white cheddar.  About $4 for 6oz. Nice strong nutty flavor good with sweet fruit or earthy crackers
I love eating mold
1:10  “It’s like biting into a crayon”  Mmm that must taste very good
I can't concentrate on the cheese  with those magical blue eyes looking at me 👁
How are people pointing out 1:18 as a fart? Aren’t you all watching the screen as well? That sounds literally happens the exact moment the edge of her knife hits the table, and it even sounds like a metal tapping the table. Y’all are soooo so dumb for not being able to put two and two together! Zero intelligence
Cheeses can have a fruity taste????🤔
Is cheese kind like wine, the older the better? no wonder wine and cheese are suited together.
THe blue cheese was probaly Rogue River
I love how she explained the importance of "voting with your dollar" in the US. Props for that!
i wish i could go around telling people i’m a cheese expert :(
An American cheeze expert?
I know what is expensive just by looking it. Very ez
Is it just my eyes or did they use the Irish flag for the parmigiano reggiano?
You can tell she's an expert because she can contain her excitement when presented with a GIANT BLOCK of Rogue River
Is this a real job ?!?????!?!???!?!?!?!?!?!
The fanciest cheese I’ve had Is powdered Parmesan from the super market real cheese Is way to expensive
Im not lying, i have never eaten a cheese in my life or seen a chesse
5:20 SAY IT! IT'S A GRUYÈRE AND YOU KNOW IT! SEE? NO HOLES!  Edit : hooray she said it!
Cheez man
she looks like melted cheese   so hot,Ok sorry but she is a cheese professional,I love cheese....i will shut up now
I got all but the feta just by pausing the video and looking at them lmao. Now let me go back to my ~block of sharp white cheddar and shredded cheese~
When you accidentally saw her at the grocery store looking at different cheese to pick from and you wonder what she's doing and you don't know she's an expert in cheese 😂
I could watch this over and over 😋🤤
2:24 they used the Irish flag instead of the Italian flag for the left cheese
I kind knew the answer to  the cheap & expensive cheese from the way she explained them soooo does that make me an experts😂
This woman is so cheesy.
The parmeggiano reggiano had the irish flag on it😂😂
1:18 did she just fart???
honestly these vids, i would be more impressed by experts guessing the more expensive between 2 that are only a few dollars difference.  im not an expert on anything and i can look at most of these cheeses or other videos items and guess which is more expensive and im close to always right.
Do I count as a cheese expert if I can literally just look at them and guess which ones more expensive because I mean it’s totally not obvious at all.
Give her cheese without the appearance....bet she won’t get it
I can tell which cheap is expensive by looking at my wallet after I buy it
cheese is the best food in the world.
*when you know most of the facts and guessed the same stuff as her* I may be a cheese expert
If i can only afford it at the end of the month, that mean its the cheaper one.
What's with the tense spy music every time she tastes the cheese?🤔
not sure why i’m here but i’m glad i’m here
Bruh imagine being a teacher and asking a student what they wanna be when they grow up and that kid says “cheese expert”
Imagine being Gordon Ramsay but with only 1 topics like chocolate, cheese that says alot about gordon
Those American blue cheeses have hardly any mold compared to the blue cheeses here in the UK
Is anyone here from being bored and binge watching tv shows
Feta cheese has like no flavor
I remembered that I'm allergic to dairy about halfway through the video.
Why the Irish flag with the Parmigiano Reggiano?
i just bought pecorino romano and that cheese it good
if she does not notice the difference she is no cheese expert, the first is good cheese, Parmigiano Reggiano, the second a fake, an imitation usurping a name to deceive consumers it is the real thing
americani non capite una sega di formaggio          translation: you americano know nothing bout cheese
I want this job
Whats a cheese expert
irish parmesan is even better
I'd kill to have skin like hers while being a cheese expert lol
Ghost like this video
I need to take A LOT of Lactaid pills to do this job, because I’m lactose intolerant, it will be worth it because I absolutely love cheese
swear she basically said american swiss cheese is better than swiss swiss cheese
Hmmm...
When I grow up I want to be a cheese expert. Cause that’s very important to the world. Without cheese expert we would have no cheese. I want to know so much about cheese that I was a degree in cheese
Didn't know i could get payed for being white
In short: The better the quality of the cheese the bigger the price.
Purple eyes?! Contacts?
2:24 I didn't know Parmigiano-Reggiano came from Ireland
really makin me wanna waste money on fancy cheese
She looks like Julie Bowen
Wait it’s a Greek law to make Greek Feta with sheep and goat milk?
Tabla
Interesting
She knows her stuff, but ngl, it's not that hard to tell which cheese is more expensive, you could honestly tell just by looking at them😂
only me eating hamburger cheese while watching this?
may I ask how she got to this point I mean her job is to eat cheese
I want her to come back and try funky cheeses.....like the brain mold cheese
I missed this early one. I like the additional facts she gives, but I miss the impressive chalk art that's in the other ones.
I bet this ladies cholesterol is sky high. Cheese has so much cholesterol in it.
Parmeggiano Reggiano is the European name for Parmesan? No?
I actually learnt something 😂
I am italian and if ya want to speak italian you need to use double letters is not parmigiano is parmiggiano the pronounce
oh my god this kinda makes me bleuuugh
I wonder who thought it was a good idea to eat old cheese
The size of the pieces she cuts and then discards bugs me do much 😂 it's like I can almost hear my mom yellow "DON'T CUT THAT ID YOU AIN'T GONNA EAT IT!!!!!"
I have achieved great knowledge  Cheese knowledge
I just eat the cheapest cheez still the same😑
this is my dream job
When i grow up i wanna be a cheese expert
My stando cuk-e-CHEESE let’s me tell if cheese 🧀 s cheap or expensive
The leaf wrapping is vine leaves
She keeps saying "I guess this is the more expensive one..." .Honestly when you know  THIS MUCH about  cheese is it really  a "guess" !?! Great vid!
It's funny how all the most expensive cheese was cheese B
She’s eating cheese
For you, the day Blue cheese graced your table was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday
I wonder, why they do these videos, because im sure, that 99% of the viewers know, exactly, which cheese is more expensive without smelling and or tasting it. I still enjoy the video, but it is preety obvious.
"I'm Liz Thorpe and I'm a *thump* cheese"      Who knows knows
That's funny!  So far I've guessed all the right ones just by looking at their appearance.
Uuuh the flag on the more expensive parm should be italian its an irish flag
The older the cheese the more expensive lol
Thank you for sharing your enthusiasm and knowledge about cheese. It makes me feel confident seeing my in laws from Europe in the future. Hahahaha
Wait what. She said "Biting into a crayon" 0_0
You can tell it easily by taste 'cause expensive makes you worry about your financial regret
I thought the title said “Chinese expert going to guess cheap or expensive Chinese foods “ anyone else ? Lols
i didn't need to be cheese expert to guess correctly which one would taste better and of course more expensive by the look of it
My brain at 3:00 midnight: you have to watch a lady guessing what cheese is cheap and whats expensive Me: why? My brain: you just gotta
Exactly what we needed a cheese expert , what's next a water expert ?
But that wasn't Italian flag, it was Ireland's flag lol
2:26 am i blind or the flag is wrong? lol That is orange, aka Republic of Ireland's flag, not Italian
She really know her stuff!
She's hackingggg
Lmaooo here in Italy the parmigiano reggiano aged for 24 months costs 13 euros/kg
Here’s a tip the more disgusting hard cheese is the more expensive one
Cheese 🧀
Is it just me or does she have purple eyes
I searched what brand of cheese are you and I’m not disappointed
I remember when I was young, whenever I watch Tom and Jerry, I used to think that cheese were quite sweet and creamy-   Well, that was like my ideal thought of cheese before having real cheese.
this would be more enjoyable if she was lactose intolerant
If it looks more rancid it’s more expensive.
I love blue cheese
When you choose everyone the professional does 😁
This is the whitest video i've ever laid my eyes upon
This is definitely what I should be watching at 2:00 am
That's great and all but have you asked Arsenio Hall how good the cheese is?
Mm this is a great idea, I’m gonna feed this to my basement kids 👨
You want the worlds best parmesan? Buy Wisconsin cheese, Wisconsin cheesemakers make up 5 of the top 6 finishers in that category of the World Cheese Competition (Wisconsin cheese makers regularly take the top spot and most of the top 20 for every cheese style)
the dislikes are from lactose intolerant peeps
29$/lbs for parmigiano regiano?? Bruh I can get 1kg for the same price where I live 🤣
So aged cheese are expensive one..then why the hell there is expiry date on package?
That first flag is Irish not Italian.
So I think I’am the only one who really hate her hand gestures.
Let her taste Harzer Rolle. 😂
2:25 is it just me or did they just said that the cheese can be only made in Italy and on the price tag they have the Irish flag on it
1:18 did someone fart😂
I think it would be pretty cool to see an expert compare two different things—like, have Liz compare a parmegiano-reggiano to like, a cheddar, and talk about the difference between them and figure out what’s more expensive across the kinds.
Bish why don’t I just buy a fresh and then let It age? LE FCK?
Old = more expensive  New = less expensive   Well then Im gonna kidnapp only boomers  no kids anymore
No one talkin about the fart at 1:18 ??
The goat cheese was actually about 3 times more expensive per ounce (4$ per 4oz = 1$ per 1oz vs 20$ per 6oz ~ 3,33$ per 1oz), not 5. It was 5 times as expensive per wheel, but not by weight.
2:24 OMG the Italian mafia is going to take this channel down if they found out you put Irish flag instead of Italian
Very surprised she said that she buys the American version as she doesn't notice the difference, other than on salads.  Having said that, I like plenty of less expensive cheeses, too :-)
*Comedy skit Idea* An expert cheese taster but lactose intolerant, and over the skit, endures the gut wrenching pain but still keeps the poise but visibly in diarrhoea state.
The weird looking cheese is the more expensive...easy 😐
Crunchy cheese sounds terrible
i love cheese so much but i’m lactose intolerant
Watched this while eating Parmigiano-Reggiano
http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFrZDWn4JOrEMdEFKM3yGvA you’re gonna love this
I knew i was depressed when  I heard "cooked pressed cheeses", as "cook depressed cheeses".
2:25 that’s the flag of ireland...Italy is green white and red
This was a very pleasant video I must say.
That aged goat cheese looks like a disease
am i the only one getting annoyed by the fact that the italian flag actually looks as if it is the irish one?
About the last cheese which was made by the one farm in the world, I actually live very near where they make that. It’s in Cornwall in the uk and it’s a style of cheese which involves wrapping it in stinging nettles
Her: it’s like bitting into a crayon  Me: wow  My mom: so you’ve been eating crayons
Who else watching this during lockdown?                                                      Ps I don’t even like cheese...
She looks like cheese.
If it has mold it’s expensive 🤔
This video in a nutshell: a well-intentioned, informative-ish lesson in some cheeses. The failure is in the last sampling. She never reveals the exact name of the cheese. There are many types of bleue cheese. My guess is the grape leaf wrapped cheese is a type of Gorgonzola—but again, she never said.
Can she be my teacher like damn i like the way she teaches and all my attention is on her and what shes talking about
I like how, like, amercans, like, like, use, like, the word, like, like, like in every other sentece, like, its kind of, like, the language, like, has, like deteriorated. And I'm not, like, a native speaker.
This is a no brainer tho....... Jesus
anyone could tell this
So I was scrolling and my brain replaced "cheese" with "Chinese", so everything in the thumbnail made me question life.
Is no one gonna talk about the knife- It's a fridgin cheese knife-
Omg I cannot tell who she looks like!
Imaging going to school for over twelve years just to become a cheese expert
Are we just gonna ignore that the flag on the first cheese looks suspiciously like irelands flag and not Italy’s?
Eden Cheese...
this is the best I can tell which cheeses are cheap and expensive, don't be fooled.
I know the most expensive aged cheese! It is!!        Old grandpa toe cheese
What fun!
You don’t have to be an expert to see store bought cheese when you look at it
It's like Napoleon Dynamite taste testing milks for the FFA.... like the God milk from the tuna onion patch.
I had to take a pee the other day, and i smelled something of a really really old cheese. Lady can you help me with this ?
Why are all “cheese experts” white blonde American girls? Lol
i think A in 2nd comparison is either manouri or feta .
C H E E S E  E X P E R T
Is it me tripping or that italian flag looks like the Irish flag 2:24
i want that knife ... any ideas of the name or brand ?
what was that noise at 1:18
has anybody ever in this series got it wrong
the worse and more inedable the cheese looks the more expensive
omg this iis so sticky and white I can barely talk   sorry
It's 3 am and I am lactose intolerant
I've learned more from this more than I could ever at school 😑
I first read the title as “Chinese expert guesses cheese”
Mom: what's your dream job? Me:
Any one else hate how she says “pahrm-my-jaunoe-rejjjieanoe”
The i in reggiano is just as silent as the one in parmigiano, had to get that out of my system x) I really enjoyed that vid tho, I vould listen to her talking about cheese for hours!
Am I an expert if I could tell which one was more expensive by look?
Tu peux pas être une expert du fromage si tu n'es pas française ou a la limite italienne. Tes mensonges ne trompent personnes vil mégère. #jesuisdevilman
Cheese is cheese
fart @ 01:18
I can't be the only one who read the title wrong
Parmigiano Reggiano has to be aged at least 12 months, not 18. Iive in the area where it's made and shops and producers commonly sell it when it's 12 months old. In fact, many people prefer it that young. As for the robot machines turning the wheels, I've never heard of that. Yes, the wheels are heavy, but they can be turned by hand, even if you need two people, but usually whoever works Parmigiano Reggiano is used to handling it and can lift it, there's no need for a robot machine. Brushing the cheese.... Again, I've never heard of that. Personally I've visited dairies where this particular cheese is made 3 times and no guide or worker has ever said anything about brushing. Turning, yes. Open air, depends what she means by open air. Usually the wheels are aged in a room where temperature and humidity are constantly the same, they have ventilation systems etc that keep them in control. So yeah, they are in open air, but still in a very strictly monitored room. If she meant that they're not in cloths or molds or containers of any kind then yes, that's correct. They're just sitting on wooden shelves. Another difference with american parmesan, which I believe because of the regulations is not legally allowed to be called Parmigiano Reggiano, is that Parmigiano Reggiano is branded with fire. When the makers are done aging it, an expert will come to test the quality of the cheese, and if everything is well he'll brand the cheese with this metal tool that imprints the name of the cheese on the wheel (many times, all around the curvy part of the wheel) , as well as various codes that stand for where the cheese was made, the specific Province and maker, and when. This fire brand is so important that this cheese cannot be called Parmigiano Reggiano without. I don't know about the difference in taste with the American cheese given the fact that I've never tried it, but I really doubt that they taste the same, or that one couldn't tell the difference. Parmigiano Reggiano has a very distinct taste, especially if as old as the one presented in this video, which seemed quite old. I couldn't say exactly how old, but I can see that it has at least 48 months. Also, those granules, the crystals, are not protein crystals, (I don't think proteins can crystallise, but correct me if I'm wrong) but calcium clusters. When the cheese ages the calcium in it tends to compact and crystallise like that, I don't know why though. I think it has something to do with the lactic acid breaking down, but honestly I'm not sure so I don't want to say anything incorrect.
1:17 tell me im not the only one that fking heard that xDDDD
The smell is probably cheesy
why do I keep thinking of how her eyes look purple
Only a cheese person has room for the idea of a Tuesday cheese.
Female Dovahkiin after solving Skyrim problems gets invited to talk about cheese (and you know why)
they have done it they brought a karen on this show
Boomer cheese
I bet her farts were gnarly after this vid
She just wanted to eat cheese lmao
This isn’t all that helpful when we aren’t given the names. All we know for sure is that more expensive cheeses have more complex flavors
When I spend the money on Parmiganio reggiano I eat it straight up and don't put it on anything lol
swiss (and in europe in general) produce grass feed cheese too... it's just more expensive... Also ... usually it's the same producers, it's just depending if it's made on spring/summer or fall/winter
So if my milk were to spoil is it the beginning of a blue cheese?
The uglier it looks, the tastier it gets.
Oh she is a cheese expert but she doesn’t have a proper cheese knife to cut    it 👍🏼
This woman is amazing!!! So much knowledge and appreciation for artisanal cheese making, I loved it!
I feel like for most it’s pretty obvious by the way they look
The weird looking one is more expensive
why are people watching this and why am i watching this
You can really tell when she hates something. Her entire face changes to disgusted lol
You will die if you use play a drinking game with this video and the word cheese.
My lactose intolerance is screaming
Cow’s milk feta ???
So basically the uglier the cheese the more expensive it is.
Simps in the comments showing their love to the cheese goddess.
people who dislike the video is lactosed intolerant
What cult do you have to go through to be a cheese expert
Get me on this show, I can tell the difference between cheap vs expensive weed.
that's one hell of a chinese expert.
i think you forgot about a certain cheese :^)
Btw I think the last leaf-wrapped blue cheese is called Rogue River Blue. I've had it. It really is that good.
Must be nice :(
Mice in cheese factories: 👁️👄👁️
So basically the more moldy and expired it looks the more expensive
Moral of the story: She knows her cheese.
I like pretty cheese lady
I love cheese😍
How to tell cheap cheese from expensive cheese:  Step 1. Which one looks older. Congrats now you know how to tell cheap cheese from expensive
they.. they used the flag of Ireland for Italian cheese.. 2:24
This video makes my stomach hurt
this is somehow not hard to guess the price by the look, although I cant tell what cheese that is
I literally guessed every single one just by looking at it its not that hard
Is it weird that I guessed all these right? 😂
cheap
Teachet: What does your mum do for a living? Her son : SHE IS A CHEESE EXPERT
THIS VIDEO* Old cheese= Expensive cheese
I love cheese! it undergoes enough change (the harder ones anyway) so that I can eat it with my lactose intolerance! Danablue is sooo good!
no one talking about how her name is liz and she looks & sounds like a younger version of liz from tvd..

Absolutely fabulous episode....thank you
Thats why i like milfs

He breathe must smell
She gets paid for this??? Man sign me up
No casu marzu??  A shame 😂😂😂
You can the dissapointment on her face when she said I'm a cheese expert.
Kinda biased as she's able to tell just from looking at it.
And I thought I loved cheese
Did she remind anyone else of Miranda from Sex and the City?
I don’t know if it’s because Im french or else but I feel like all of these were just obvious like for the blue cheese or the goat cheese. It was still really interestings explanations tho
i don't eat cheese too much and why i guess it all correct.?
What this video has taught me:  If you make your cheese look really gross you can sell it for more.
I am also a cheese expert because I go to the fridge at 3am and eat a bag of shredded cheese
I’m lactose intolerant
Why am I watching this at 1:00
in my opinion the only good feta cheese is the jared one from apetina here in scandinavia, no i dont know where it is made but i've been in greece and damn that wet feta cheese is not something i would call feta cheese, even though, as i think, feta cheese is a greek thing.
You don't even need to be a cheese expert to know which is more pricey.  If it's dark, it's expensive.  If it looks old, it's expensive.  If it has a more compact and intense smell and flavour, it's expensive.  If it looks more exotic than the other one, it's expensive.  You don't need to be a genious to know that. It's common sense.
cheese is CHEESE
wow this women is payed to eat cheese  AMAZING!
WHY THE HELL AM I WATCHING THIS
So, how do I get this job?
she just looks like a cheese expert
I can literally tell cheese by looking at the cheese dont need details not a taste its that easy
God i want some cheese rn
With most of these guess which one is more expensive videos you can guess which one is more expensive by just looking at them both.. its like so obvious

Blue cheese is literally just mold cheese I hate it
You know you’re at a low point when the most notable thing about you is that you’re a cheese expert
I think i can be a cheese master now :3
Is that Miranda from sex and the city or am I crazy?
CHEESE IS CHEESE !!
in conclusion: old was always expensive.
Crunchy cheese
Make her taste the Cazu marzu

Who else thinks this is really satisfying to watch🤔
😋 😋 🧀 💫 💛
I never thought I’d be this interested in cheese
ceo of right off the bat
Alpine is not just Switzerland, it also can be Austria.
she could literally be completely bullshitting and none of us would know
I’m getting flashbacks of raven eating that cheese in the air vents
How do you become a cheese expert? Do you go to cheese school?
She just says she needs to taste it because she wants to eat the expensive cheese.
7:25 and 7:33 who noticed she cut into cheese b both times when comparing both cheeses? Did they use the same footage??
dont you think that confidence and professionality radiates attractiveness? I am a gay man but listening to her just makes my heart beat faster lol
If youre asian blue cheese is just awful 😵
i’m vegan, i don’t know why i’m here.
Never knew there were cheese specialists out there. I wanna be a cheese specialist.
Liz: "I'm a cheese expert!" Also Liz: "I usually go with Parmesan [...] I can't notice the difference that much". Are you serious!? I'm no cheese expert at all but I could tell a parmesan from an Italian Parmigiano Reggiano with my freaking eyes closed and just from the smell, without even tasting them. It must be because I've eaten Parmigiano Reggiano, Pecorino Romano and Grana Padano all my life and the first time I went to the States and tried their crappy parmesan cheese I wanted to cry in despair.
Any chance I could get some tips on selecting a good Brie? I like to warm up Brie so it becomes gooey, but I've experienced some brands just straight up completely melting into what is essentially butter. Would such a thing mean it's a cheap cheese or a high-quality cheese? Thanks
Just imagine what here stool smells like
God damn shes so hot and knows her stuff
I wish this was my job bc I love cheese 🧀🧀🧀
Why does she look like an ABBA reject?? Or like she's related to Agnetha  Edit: 6:02 She reminds me of Monica Geller
My dream job
Im so shocked about the prices. Here in Europe, cheese is much cheaper.
Bla bla bla
I hate that she cut in pieces bigger than how much she actually taste.
She probably smell like cheese
She's wasting all that cheese by cutting a huge block then only proceed to take small bite!
Funny how Americans, even a cheese "expert", can't distinguish between "parmigiana" and "parmesan", so they end up pronouncing parmesan, which has no "G", either hard or soft, as "parmagian". Typical American ignorance, I guess.
uglier=more price
i use eden cheese
Me: it's 4:23 am and I WANT CHEESE GODDAMIT Also me: I've never eaten anything but britania slice cheese/babybels (when I was younger)
I don't even like cheese and I'm watching this...
I just like cheese
i can just look at these and tell
*”I’m Liz Thorpe and I’m a cheese expert”*  4 year old me when I learned that cheese is made from milk
Poor woman, after all that strong cheese i imagine she won't be able to poop
This was very interesting!
Whitest video ever
Weird flex but ok
Now I'm gonna stop h in the comments here's the twist  She actually looked at it she's not really an expert🤣  (Jk IDK)
How TF u can become Cheese Expert lol
it's 4:51 am and im watching someone smell and eat cheese.
In den nächsten Tagen werden wir die nächsten zwei Tage wieder in die Schule fahren oder nicht oder soll es auch nicht klappen oder so dass wir es morgen wieder sehen oder so und ich bin auch          That is what happens when you put your keyboard on german and just type what ever is suggested
The video was great but it was pretty obvious which was more expensive
I thought she was going to be swiss or french
*i want her knife*
I love CHEESE 🧀 🍷
Let me guess, no one searched for this video
Me, having splurged and eaten 5 lbs of Greek Feta cheese a few months back: *laughing while holding back tears as she talks about Feta’s prices*
Okay so the nastier the cheese looks, the more expensive it is. Got it...
Damn she really put the goat cheese near her nose like that while I can’t even stand the smell from a meter away 😭😩😩
old is gold.
If she’s an expert, she shouldn’t be guessing.
I have work at 8 in the morning and I'm watching a video a woman guessing between cheese  I'd say I'm doing well with my life
She looks like a crackhead
I guessed every one right, old=more expensive
I miss her. No new vids with her?
Boola boola!
Do this blindfolded.
Imagine watching a woman eat cheese
A cheese connoisseur.  I like.   I watched this while I shredded cheese.
I hate cheese why am I here
She looks a lot like julie bowen
Je suis baguette
1:18 I'm the only one who heard that?
I always come back to watch this bc this woman is just so damn stunning, I know I'm weird....
I feel so worthless, I don't have fancy cheese knives. :(
watching this while eating a sandwich with Krafts American cheese
CHEESE
Wtf is a cheese expert?
She needs her own channel!
I've just become a cheese expert.
Our society is so underwhelming that we have people calling themselves quote on quote "cheese experts" unironically.
I think ive watched this vdieo at least 4 times now
cheese is a loaf of milk.
The worse and more disgusting it looks the more expensive it is.
As a Swiss, I feel I am taking part on a council.
a job where you paid to eat chesse!?! im in!!!
I aspire to be this woman in 5 years
the fact that being a cheese expert is a legit job
I think someone farted at 1:18 ??!
WOAH, THAT'S AN IRISH FLAG, NOT AN ITALIAN ONE🤣
IT is so RUDE that there ISN'T Georgian Cheese, and if you don't know why I said that just Google it
Imagine paying 50$ for a cheese with mold, Jesus.
Me: * *_cries in Processed cheese_* *
For a cheese expert she doesn’t know how to cut cheese
I'm getting diareah looking at this
I cant get over the fact that she looks mouselike
Whats that noise in 1:18 ?!?!
Ok but can we take a moment and gaze in her GORGEOUS VIOLET EYES?
Cheese candy... two fav words  saying it makes my mouth water.
Dammit i watched it at 1am and now i want a snack
No way is someone going to be that accurate with identifying all the cheese...
A mouse joke.
if she is a cheese expert so am i
Why am i here i dont even like cheese
Stupid to compare prices when the cheeses do not weight the same smh🤦‍♂️ 4$ 4oz and 20$ 6oz ok... So not 5x more expensive ( 3:59)
So like... you can actually call the cow milk "feta" a feta in US? In europe its literally illegal cause of the laws protecting regional products. Which means we know if we buy a product called feta it will always be real and regulated. You can buy fake feta type cheeses but theyre always called like "Greek cheese" or something. Same thing with mozarella and polish "oscypek" cheese - name protected by law.
Cheese expert and doesn't know how to pronounce the cheese name correctly.. makes sense to me
Soooo, the one that looks older is the more expensive one. Shock.
I’m not a cheese expert but I can tell which one is cheap and expensive
6:25 Switzerland is not part of the EU
Who else heard a fart sound? 1:18
the way she talks is so elegant
They make it so easy to identify Which is which
Ugly= more worth Ugly= you
The goat cheese is not 5x as expensive it’s only 3.33...x as expensive. Learn math
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BACKGROUND...cmon
if it stinks it stonks
I hate cheese but I’m still gonna watch it._.
I’m guessing quarantine?
Is she related to The Waitress from Always Sunny in Philadelphia?
Here i am watching cheese. Damn i need to work.
There is a cheese exclusively from Serbia that is about  $70 or $700 which is only in one region is dinkey cheese
Damn she really knows her cheese!
Try a 24 months Gruyère next time. Very few people eat a cheese that young in Switzerland... that’s mostly for exportation 🤷🏼‍♂️
Whoever did the flag for the expensive Parmesan at the start didn't do a very good job
Plot twist she's stacy's mom
Anybody realise that the price tag is for different amounts
originally i was going to listen to music. this is my 5th cheese related video, I DONT EAT CHEESE
girlfriend: whats your occupation? me: *cheese* *expert*
Did she just says "northern Italy"? CMBYN Fans (◕ᴗ◕✿)
I watched this eating a cheese stick
I really want to taste every cheese from the video
>cheese expert
She looks like "Stacy's Mom" (Rachel Hunter)
She looks like a Karen..
If it looks older it's expensive
She's so annoying.
America is a lawless wasteland when it comes to cheese regulations
She looks like Madeline Kahn. She doesn't sound like her, though.
you know you’re french when you can just tell visually which one is more expensive
Next time I’m wondering why the fancy cheese section is so expensive as I head to the Kraft cheese aisle across the store I’ll know the reason.   Maybe I’ll break down and try the $$$ one.
She looks like Miranda from Sex and the city
My dream job
I love how she gets excited every time she gets it right 🖤
I am pretty sure that is fig leaf.
I wanna taste those cheeses so badly.-
She looks like  wine expert
Didn’t it piss anyone off how she cut the cheese
Julie Bowen
Next Up : Porn "Expert" Guesses Amateur vs Pro Porn.
I heard a fart at 1:18
"Not in the mood for cheese? That excuse has more holes than this fine slice of Gorgombert !!"  come on somebody must know this
Friend: What’s your job? I’m a Veterinarian!  Friend 2: I’m a construction worker!  Me: Oh I do YouTube!  Me, Friend 1 and 2 look at friend 3:  Friend 3: I’m a cheese expert.
She kinda looks like she'd be a cheese expert.
So the more disgusting the more expensive. I get it now
كل الإحترام والمحبة عمل رائع ولذيذ شكرا
Who likes cheese know  Me. I don’t like cheese know
Secret plot twist: this cheese expert with her precisely honed palate actually went home after correctly guessing all these expensive cheeses and opened her cupboard, loosened the plastic top off a can of CheezWiz, and sprayed a huge mountain of it directly into her mouth!
like biting into a crayon...yeah...thats what I want, it would be cheaper to put salt on a crayon than to buy good cheese
White people love cheese
I can't unsee but her hair makes her look like cheese
Gotta admit, she knows her stuff - and explains all that lovely info without being snooty or anything. Just a pleasant time, honestly. I feel like I've learned and retained.
Man, I wish I'd get my hands on that special gorgonzola that ripens for a year or two without having to pay a fortune. Maybe I should become a cheese expert and work for Epicurious and hope they serve it to me. :D
1:12 ... Biting into a crayon?!? What the?
This was the video that introduced me to Epicurious
You have every expert ever
The uglier, the more expensive
Now this is quality content
Cheese is a kind of meat
Anyone else thinks she looks strikingly like Actress Julie bowen from Modern Family?
I wish my guidance counselor would have told me that you can make a living out of eating cheese.
While watching this video i got a parmigiano reggiano ad😂😂
Grass fed, water drank, oxygen inhaled cows milk.
Nobody :   Her hand : ↗️➡️↘️↙️⬅️⬆️↖️⬇️
Whoever made the decision in the past to solidify milk to make the masterpiece known as cheese, thank you.
OMG, beyond the fact that she is a super cheese expert and very didactic, does she really have purple eyes??? The sooner  I saw her in the thumbnail the faster I clicked on the video just to see whether she really had this pretty purple eyes or it was something from my mind
Why does she look, talk and move exactly like Tina from The L Word
The older the cheese is the expensive it gets
Why is it 30 and 15 dollars for cheese?  Is 15 cheap in the USA?
How amazing what a wonderful mind thanks for sharing your expertise with us common folk😁
I like how she didn't say one was better than the other. Its about how you use young and old cheese
A common thing in all these vids is how sugar is used in cheapo production
I love the fact that in EU you can't call your cheese feta if it's not feta. Same with all other's region protected names, that's a nice move for customer, because you are not paying a lot of money for something trying to mimic original product
I love this queen!!
What the hell is a cheese expert? It is a cool video, but ive never heard of that until now. Im guessing it's like a type of chef. Although seems strange for someone to hire her just to tell her what cheese it is, especially when the type of cheese is written on the outside of the wrapper. If anybody has any experience with a cheese expert please tell me i would personaly want to know what they do or if it this lady is simply extremely obsesed with cheese.
Is her eyes purple?
You could have picked anyone from Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa to do this and they would be batting 1.000
I would be interested to know what, exactly, all the cheeses are (Producer and style) at some point in the video or the description. Because I can't really go in and ask for it based on a description of the video.
Can I have her job, please!! Yes, I am lactose intolerant but cheese is life 🤣 I'll take the tummy acks to eat cheese for a living!!!
This highlights how bad American food standards are :/
Her mascara tho
You dont even need to taste it to tell which is more expensive. Im no cheese expert but I can guess which is more expensive by how moldy and rotten the cheese looks
As a person who dont like cheese, this would be a terrible job for me.
did she fart at 1:19 or i''m bugging?
This is my dream job
Costco has all the authentic cheeses for a great price!
If it looks worse, it's more expensive
Yes
Cheese B of the Blue Cheeses is Rogue River Blue Cheese from Oregon. It won world's best cheese at the 2019 World Cheese Awards
I know nothing and I got everything right. It’s just what looks older/more aged.
1:18 Do you hear that? Somebody farted.
She looks like a cheese expert.
I'm no expert, but all these videos are easy to spot
Why would y’all give her cheeses in wedges and with rind? If it has a rind or even looks aged, almost 90% of the time she already knows.  Just cut two tiny chunks and have her guess. A true challenge.
she’s betty from riverdale, she put her genius senses to cheese, and left her past behind
4:05 "it's 5X more expensive" Nope u are wrong. The Second blind tasting, Cheese A costs $4/ 4oz = $12/ 12oz Cheese B costs $20/ 6oz = $40/ 12oz  That's makes cheese B just a little over 3X as expensive as cheese A.  U surely know ur cheese but leave the math part to us Asian kids.
Government subsidies. Icky.
Nasty moldy calf food
Did anyone notice the cheese knife
This vid is so cheesy
i dont even like cheese.. and i knew them all...
I’d love to be a cheese expert and taste cheese for a living
I can't stand Bleu Cheese.
You forgot my Wensleydale

Is it just me or is American cheese disgusting ? I feel like the reason people I know like it is nostalgia
Anybody watching this, 3 am while eating cheese?
Por qué me aparece esto justo cua do hace unos dias me apareció un tutorial de como cortar parmesano regiano?
Mmmmm cheesy
4:03 that's not 5 times more expensive. $4 for 4 oz and $20 for 6 oz, not $20 for 4 oz. If it was $20 for 4 oz, then it would have been 5 times pricier. So if for 6 oz it costs $20, then how much does it cost for 4oz? 4x20 = 80. 80 / 6 = 13.333. So for 4 oz, B costs $13.333. Let's say $13. $13 / $4 = 3.25. So B costs 3.25 times more than A.
wow the professional got all of the questions right thats crazy
“Like bitting into a crayon.”   Very helpful, I always know what that tastes like.
Omelette Du Fromage
who made her a cheese expert did she just sad that and thats it ? or is there something i dont get?
I could guess all the expensive ones myself and I'm no expert. 😂
how tf do you become a cheese expert lol
1:18 Fart XD
I've never understood blue cheese... like let me put this stuff that i clean off my walls or floor into my food.  Wut?
I eat cheese on a dai[r]y basis.
I can tell which is more expensive by the way it looks...
The cheese lady, the wine lady and the meat guy are my favorites
No its not five times more expensive.  Different weights...
Im supposed to be studying rn
This milk tastes like the cow got into an onion patch.
It kind of obvious tho
People : What's your job Her: Oh I am a cheese expert what do you do? People: .... I am a fast food worker
It's funny how such a cheese expert would really be jobless in france or italy
did she not do the exact same freaking thing for another video ? lol just the cheeses are different
why is the flag on the first cheese irish
Newest Alphabet  *shocking one  https://youtu.be/-I7v0HqejXE
Well, minute 2:01 the Parmigiano Reggiano doesn't must be aged at least 18 months, from 12 to 36, 12/18/24/36
I'm hungry
Omg imagine when she farts 😧
Cheesus
her tits tho
1:18 she's lactose intolerant
*a PORNSTAR can tell if my cheese is expensive or not???*
In the first comparison the more expensive cheese is double the size of the cheaper cheese .(price is also double) technically the price must be the same .
Government regulated just means inflated price, and does not mean the cheese is better. This is why mainstream news is dying, their love of government regulation is not sticking well with our generation
Imagine kissing her
Was the blue cheese Rouge?
She prob has the worst farts
6:15 surprise to see something from USA is more expensive than Europe counterpart
How much protein do those crystals have
Oh so the cheese that smells, looks, and tastes older is the more expensive one   Would not of guessed that
Bruh there has now been an expert for: cheese, coffee, ice cream, bread, vinegar, knives, spices, whiskey, hot sauce, chocolate, meat,  another cheese video, bacon, wine, pickles, tea, condiments, beer, sausages, butter, pasta, mustard, yogurt. heck even an expert for freaking salt!! I didn't even know there were more than 2 different types of salt XDDD I'd like to know where they are getting these so called "experts"  and what's next? "A sugar expert" lol
even i could guess what's more expensive.
The thing I realised from this video is that I know a lot about cheese as well lmao
The chalkboard expert took the day off :(
I’m eating cheese while watching this it’s just mild cheddar from the store tho :P
I don’t think she’s a cheese expert,  she’s a wine expert that dables in cheese
Wtf is a cheese expert
Kaşar uzmanı
I‘m from switzerland. And I get very angry if someone says „swiss cheese“ because there isn‘t such a thing. But what I can definately say is that I can go to the supermarket and buy a cheese called „Appenzeller“ and its better than anything this woman ever had.
I love how humble she is.  Like, she knows she knows a lot, but she's okay if she were to get one wrong.
I would like to know if this woman is married. If this woman is single I would totally ask her out on a date. Her knowledge about cheese is super sexy and a turn-on for me.
In France, the smellier the better.
Someone pay you to know how cheese is?
So in general, american cheese is not up to standards, but ok for general usage
We can physically tell if it is cheap or expensive and i am not an expert
it amazes me how they can guess right!
What everyone sees: I'm Liz Thorpe and I'm a cheese expert.  what i see: *I'm Karen and I'm taking the kids.*  Karen  i miss you

Only One Business in the Galaxy Gets You This Rich...
As a Try Guys fan, she has a resemblance with Ariel Fulmer.
American feta is called domestic feta, and Greek feta is usually made and imported in a barrel. The reason feta cheese is so salty is because the brine it’s kept in is just very salt induced water. Hi I work at a place called the Greek store where we sell over 20 different kinds of cheese, including about 10 different types of feta such as French, Bulgarian, and others LMAO
You mad that’s so hard for her a ha ha
Why can I just smell her breath
2:58 this is freaking me the hell out
she’s pretty for a cheese expert
This was simple which  one  was more  expensive
I kinda wanna just go into my fridge and eat cheese now...
She's so full of herself and only thinks about world's known cheeses such as brie but the thing is this goat cheese is not even close to brie
She looks like cheese
Google.com
This screams diarrhea to me. I love cheese but I'm lactose intolerant.

Cows that get free food make expensive cheese.  Cows that get food that costs the farmer make cheap cheese.   Logic? None.
I’m not a cheese expert and I guessed all of them correctly
Interesting...
Shoulda gave her some fromunda cheese 😂😂😂
"American feta"...  stop US from using European cheese names like feta (gorgozola, parmesan...), the same way i cannot produce and manifacture a carbonated soft drink then calling it "coca-cola". You understand?
Why would you be a cheese expert
I love Parmigiano Reggiano, and have been eating and cooking with it for 25 years. It is indispensable, of course. I have lived in Roma, and have travelled extensively in Italy. However, in the past couple of years, I have noticed there to be a much larger variation in its flavor. I purchase from very reputable vendors in Austin, Texas. The rinds are properly marked and stamped. However, many taste bland and odd. I often think the flavor seems "too young", not aged enough, as many samples seem softer than usual, with too much moisture, not dry and hard enough. Or perhaps I taste ammonia? I don't know. It's difficult to describe the difference, but most don't seem to have the "sour tang" that Parmigiano Reggiano should have.
AHAHAHA I’m lactose intolerant. But I love cheeseeeee
2:27 that's irish flag you numb nuts
I want some cheese now
Am I the only one that noticed the fart 1:17 😂😂😂
Is it me or did I gag when the cheese was moldy..? (Btw I don’t like cheese so why am I watching  this)
$47 for a moldy cheese wrapped in dry leaves?! WTF?
She looks like the cheese lady
"I'm a cheese expert" ... "It's [like] really intense". Bye!
See that ring on her finger... yea that's not me. *sits in silence whilst questioning own existence*
Does anybody knows the brand of the American 'Alpine'-style cheese showcased in this video? The $28 / lb?
Adult: What do you want to be when you grow up? Child:
You can look at cheese from across the room and tell which is better and more expensive
most of them are rotten cheese if you ask me, they look  poisonous and for some reason, more poisonous they look more expensive they are
what about the every popular CHEDDAR? Cmon you leave that out? Thats one of the most popular types of cheeses.
1:17 i heard a fart
Im no expert, but even i can see which cheese is the priciest
Please don’t the first one is a very aged parmiggiano reggiano if it doesn’t even have the parmiggiano reggiano marks on the crust that is a fake one it doesn’t even look great it’s too brown even if it’s aged a lot
She could obviously tell which one was more expensive. She just wanted some cheese.
Nice
Uglier is real.
I don’t think this is mad libs
How did i get here😂
Cheese expert   Mispronounces Gouda
Disgusting. leave cow milk for baby cows and goat milk for baby goats. *animal milk is not produced for human consumption!* that's why many people are lactose intolerant. would you eat cheese made from human breast milk? same concept. yuck.
Why is the flag of ireland on the parmegiano reggiano?Che cavolo
Are those the right sizes and prices
She looks so excited to taste test it
So, did anyone else hear an audible fart at 1:18 ish?
They got the Italian flag wrong. I’m triggered
Is it just me or is the one that is supposed to be Italian have an Irish flag 🇮🇪 not Italian 🇮🇹😂😂
Lmao ironic that an hour after I watched this I found a rock that looked like the cheese
Awww.. This doesnt have the beautiful chalkboard work in the background. I was kinda looking for the artwork as well
but why does the knife have holes
So basically if the cheese looks more aged then that means it’s going to be more expensive.
All cheese matters... Except the cheese that has maggots all over it lol.
Nice irish flag instead of italy didn know that parmesian and pizza came from here?
Just the cheese lady and the meat guy would be excellent party guests
this video has driven me nuts. ive tried to forget the pain it has caused me. this lady calls herself a cheese expert. if this is all it takes to be a cheese expert, sign me up. it is so obvious which cheese is more expensive. hmmmm i wonder if the blue cheese wrapped with leaves is more expensive?????????? its been nearly 2 years since i saw this video. it comes up in my feed all the time. if this is all the talent you need to be a cheese connoisseur, then sign me up.
It's like biting into a crayon  HMMMMMmmmmm!!!!🧐🤔
Coommon, you actually called the first cheese American parmesan?????? Wtf. Parmesan is Italian, not only Italian, but legally only Italian cheese made in a specific region of Italian is allowed to be called parmesan. This is no expert.
so this is what the mom from modern family does in her free time
the only cheese I know is 'Eden'
4:00 Actually B type cheese isn't 5 times expensive as A one is $4/4oz and B one is $20/6oz. Hence, B type is $13.3/4oz. Therefore B type cheese is actually 3.3 times as much as A type. Thanks for reading. Have an amazing day.
Amused that she is a cheese expert and doesn't know transhumance in the Alps...
craving cheese and biscuit at 4 in the morning 😩😩
So.. in order for people to have dairy, cows are forcibly impregnated with a metal rod up their cervix. They then become pregnant for 9 months (just like human mothers) and they form a very close bond with their baby, in the exact same way that human mothers do. Within 72 hours, the baby calf is taken away from the mother and this causes the cow and the baby calf extreme distress. The mother will try to follow her baby as far as she possibly can and when her baby is gone she will cry and mourn for days. She will go to the same place where she last saw her baby and cry. Then the whole process starts again when the farmers forcibly impregnate her again, and she goes through the same cycle over and over again until her body cant take it anymore, and then she is murdered. As for the calves, if it's a male calf they are killed for the veal industry and if it's a female they will live the same tragic fate as their mothers. Please be vegan, there are so many alternatives out there.
Everyone is always like Greek feta = best feta, but why does no one ever see the goodness of the Bulgarian a.k.a better feta. ( This is an opinion don't take it seriously 😉)
I’m qualified in C H E E S E
*Why is a Cheese Expert even a thing...*
So he can taste when the milk is spoiled
So in chesse the more older  The more expensive????
Hard cheese > soft cheese, don't even @ me
the more old and more ugly are more expensive :v
nobody talks about how she farted  1:18
Why am I watching this    Like if you are  on one of those videos you don’t know how you got here
**laughs in lactose intolerant**
As an Italian, I really hate how she says parmigiano reggiano
Dream job
It's really interesting how small differences in the methods of making the cheese can really change taste, texture and value of it
Me:what do you do for a job?      Person:im a cheese expert.     Me: ...
I always have a two year cheese, that looks normal
No drawing in the background like the other videos. Tight budget.
*C  h  e  e  s  y*
I came here from that maggot cheese vid.
how is she a cheese expert it doesn't take much to guess which one is cheap and which one is expensive
her eyes are huge and the thumbnail is scary
i hate cheese lol please don’t attack me
Yea sounds about white
Oh wow, the CHEESE EXPERT guessed the right CHEESES
Cow milk is for baby cows.
How do people like her consume so much dairy and have no acne, but then there’s me who consumes dairy once and I break out all over? Ughhhh
What a lovely person. I could watch and listen to her all day
Never knew i can eat mold and still get paid...
Plaggs best friend
1:17 anyone else hearing a fart? XD
okay now get a lactose intolerant to do this again
Here I am at 2AM
7:23 her knife🙈
Right off the bat.
I want to be a cheese expert
Now this is the right job for me.
Its so obvious though
I’m watching this and eating cheese
Me: its 2:30am go to sleep Also me: oooooo a video about cheese!!
at 1:18 did someone fart
cheese B was Rogue River bleu, wasn't it? They are the only ones I know of that make a bleu in alcohol-washed grape leaves.
Cheese expert can't even say Parmigiano Reggiano properly.
I call the crystals that grow on batteries protein crystals too
Who came here off the meat expert video ?
Wow, she really knows her craft. I can listen to her all day
When you relise you only eat the cheap stuff
“Cheese people”
by far, my favorite video ever to watch at 3 am on a saturday night.
How does one become a food expert?
Am I the only one who thought this was the ginger lady from sex and the city?
Where's the wine
Guess... more like choice
“CHEESE EXPERT?? Can’t tell the taste difference in Reggiano and a plastic American Parmesan wtffffff
Ne zeri sirekistan, fali vam juka
CHEESE IS DISGUISTING
Weird flex, but ok.
Parmesan cheese from Italy flag looks like one of the Africa’s countries since it’s orange looking when the prices are revealed
There isn't much that irks me more than not paying attention to the unit of pricing, aka the goat cheese - $4/4oz vs. $20/6oz makes it only 3 times more expensive, not 5 times! The rest get a pass THIS TIME because they were all /lb.
Imagine being a cheese expert
Cheese no good.reeeeeee!!!
I’m pretty sure an average person can tell the difference between which is more expensive
This is so sad im in europe and the only parmesan i find is the italian one lol
The editing on feta is really confusing. She appeared to try B twice...
the uglier and older looking cheese is always the more expensive
I’m watching this knowing my lactose intolerant self will actually die if I have aged cheese.
This beauty really do know her stuff
She is the best expert they found :) I can taste everything by her description :) and I really learned a lot :)
I’m now eating cheese because of this
The chocolate lady was better
Like the show just wish it wasn't so obvious like I know nothing about different types of cheeses and not to much about cooking and I figured every single one out by the first picture
Why no kraft singles?
This should have been done blind. Anyone with atleast one eye and common sense could have guessed this.
i'm now a cheese expert
Who else thought it was a kid tasting cheese because of the thumbnail?
Wha-Why would you make feta with cow's milk? The whole point of feta is that it's sheep/goats milk. I'm baffled.
Her, the bread guy, and the meat guy would make killer sandwiches
lol @ her letting 1 rip at 1:18, all that cheese
Cheese expert u say 😏😏😏
my lactose intolerance flared up just watching this video
Am I the only one who guess just by looking at them? I got all correct lol
She is aggressively beautiful
uglier and smellier the cheese the more expensive it is
you people are crazy. why buy and eat aged cheese like there's no fresh cheese for you ?
i wonder if cheesexperts are plagued with horrific extremely loud stinky fart gas that whofts and envelops all that surround them?
1:17 listen ??
She would be a cheese expert...
I got them all right and I don’t even like cheese
Best work of the world
Lmao "i do know my stuff"..."just kidding". Lol. Wanting to remain relatable much? Hahaha. Yer 3 for 3 so far in the video so yeah ...you know your stuff.
is it just me or do all the wierd lookin ones always end up being super expensive
you should have amateurs at the same time
Should have gave her Casu Marzu too
Liz Thorpe reminds me of a glamorous Brienne of Tarth.
Cheese lady, come to the north of Spain. There are several blue cheeses traditionally leaf wrapped, but which due to commercial regulations are not allowed to be sold in that traditional wrapping but aluminium foil (they have their corresponding PDO and so on). But within the small production region you can still find the real stuff... Enjoy!
.... as I empty a bottle of squeeze cheese directly into my mouth ....
she looks amazing for some one who sits around all day and eats cheese
Am a duck and am a bread expert
It’s so obvious which one is more expensive
Can we just talk about how amazing those cheese knifes are?
For the first two, she knew each fact about those two cheeses so obviously she would know witch one is more expensive
3:29 : Brie is cow milk cheese, not goat... noob
I really enjoy this series: it's not a hokey game of trying to fool the expert, it's having an expert in a particular type of food sit down and explain in detail WHY the foods are different and why that makes them more expensive/taste better.
When you grow up in southern europe and are cheese expert by birth
that chalkboard tho
Get used to it. I did
Peopoe do that now
Protien crystals? So?
Damn cheese in the US is expensive
2 Apples with some sharp cheese and crackers is my favorite lunch, with Guldens' spicey mustard and a glass of chablis. I slice the apples into thin sections before I begin eating. It doesn't get any better than that..
1:18 some one farts lol
Guys fun fact french wines are regulated everyone in the world except in the US thus why you can buy some champagne even though it's not from champagne. Fix this because not only is it misleading for consumers it harms the image of the local products from the different french regions.
She keeps repeating that she needs to taste the cheeses to judge. I was definitely hoping that the judgement will be made without tasting - that's cheating!
Ive seen this cheese expert before & she really is an expert at what she does. Definitely take her recommendations!
Hah, not so fast! You can eat the last expensive cheese any day u like bois, don’t let women tell you what to do, we are strong independent males, we can decide for ourselves
2:24 that's Ireland flag not italy
Wait there’s carotin on grass?
Where IS the french cheese ???
Well, i hate to say it but she's not a math expert (not that I can blame her, because I almost missed it myself too). $4 for 4oz is $1/oz, $20 for 6oz is ~$3.33/oz, so a bit over three times as expensive. I never noticed in previous episodes that they've had different per-unit measurements and it makes me wonder if I've been missing that this entire time. It's a really deceptive way to exaggerate or hide differences, and not happy to see it show up here.
Anyone know about Hook's 10yr cheddar $100 /lb best cheddar on this planet. Suprised you didn't talk about cheddar.
This video was pretty cheesy.   HEYOOOOOOOOO
I believe I am more qualified as I am from Wisconsin
Plot twist: they were all made with rat milk
This video proved that my life is a lie.
Im must be just me but cheese smells like swesty ballsacks to me
Moral of the story:Older is better
I’m not a cheese expert and I guessed every cheese right. I have questions for this woman’s credentials. Or, maybe I missed my calling.
7:28 when you enable voicechat in csgo competetive
Any type of food expert: "More complex flavor, hints of fruit, nuts, etc."  Cheese, whiskey, vodka, etc: "Huh? The hell kind of fruits and nuts have you been smoking?"
I want to know how they got their hands on a wheel of Rogue River Blue.  That stuff is super rare.
This cheese 🧀 taste's like the cow 🐄 got into an onion patch...
I'll stick with Kraft
6:25 switzerland is not in the eu
Cheese expert who can not pronounce Italian names of cheese... well
My favorite fromage is a Liz Thorpe "wink wink"
*me eating a bag of shredded cheese while watching this* "you know im something of a cheese expert myself."
I nibbled on some of my favorite Romano while watching this.
This woman will forever smell like cheese to me
1:18 she farted
Why do they have an Irish flag on the first one instead of an Italian flag
(white people)
All these are obvious.
1:18 anyone hear the fart?
The holes are form injecting the mold, makes for horrible blue chess.
Tip, dryed out chess also becomes more yellow and that is not always a good thing.
1:18 fart?
3:33  that’s what she said
1:18 did someone fart?
no cheese can escape this girl
Cheese has got to be one of the nastiest things humans eat. Not because of taste but because of what it is and how it's made.
Calling yourself an expert and failing to pronounce Gouda properly
The aged goat cheese is not 5 times more expensive. It is 4 oz. vs 6 oz. It is closer to 3 times more.
Sigh* i hope i was paid to eat some fvcking cheese.
Okay it’s almost midnight, i have Exams in 2 days and I’m watching some woman tasting cheese....
I dont want crunchy cheese
im a little skeptical on the gruyere without holes
Summary is expensive cheese is  "Like biting into a crayon with little salt crystals"
1:18 who cut the cheese?
I didn't know that Parmigiano-Reggiano is Irish...
First one was difficult.
She is clearly from Wisconsin....
loving this series. more, please. ^_^
She reminds me of danaerys targarian.. If she was into cheese
This is like... 80% of the time an idiot can guess the correct more expensive cheese.
Where is the mozzarella?
I never understood why people would deliberately eat mold...
they've come a long way in set design
@2:24 Didn't know Italy's flag was the same as that of Ireland's
If you wanted a honest review you hand her a piece to taste. I'm no expert and I could point out the expensive cheese the way it was presented
Her boobs B is showing a bit. I go for B
Cheap sushi vs expensive sushi!!!
She reminds me of Meg Ryan back in the day.
Ya know just your typical cheese expert
Um she didnt even try any country-cottage-cheese..must be a fancy mansion girl?
She is smoking , on fire hot .
As someone from switzerland, may i just inform you that our flag is not rectangular?! 😅
2:26 Isn't that the Irish flag, not the Italian?
ROGUE RIVER
Blue cheese is nasty.
these videos are so great! I know you mastered the food types for comparing but you could make more of these! I wouldn't mind seeing more of cheese or wine these experts are really professional and entertaining. I feel like learning while having fun. Yummi :P
Marry me?
Mm I love moldy cheese   Yummy
Click for cheese bites   1:09 1:20 3:13 3:33 5:18 5:31 7:26 7:36 9:42
You shouldn't call the Gouda cheese [goodah] for there is the unbelieveable smelly Guda cheese in Georgia, which you, obviously, know nothing about. Meanwhile it can easily compete for being world's cheese number one. You're so biased towards the European cheeses.
She only got one wrong out of the whole bunch and I’m sure that was just to throw us off!
THERES NOTHING TO GUESS! SHES A CHEESE EXPERT FOR GODS SAKE! I WOULD’VE ENJOYED WATCHING HER BEING BLINDFOLDED AND GIVEN THE DIFFERENT CHEESES SO SHE WOULD HAVE REALLY AND TRULY HAD TO GUESS THE PRICE/QUALITY AND TELL US WHICH ONE SHE LIKES BETTER!!!
Nice Irish flag on the Italian cheese there.
You took the wrong snip at 7:40
I played a game where I looked at the cheeses I guess without the expert saying anything and you Betcher I got every single one right
Different background this time! What happened to the detailed sign?
I learned too much on cheese in 11 mins of my life
If i hadn’t watched this video, I would have thought the aged goat cheese had a serious mould infection and threw it away
Small and old is more expensive I guess
I started watching video game streaming and then all of a sudden it’s 5AM and I’m learning about fine cheese. #youtuberabbithole
I'm not here for the price  I want to learn
She knows her cheese
What am i doing here? Im vegan
Brie-style ignorance
We already know how to cut parmesano reggiano
*watches in lactose intolerance*
Started to make our own cheese it's really fun
Isn't it time Liz Thorpe, cheese expert, becomes our president.
For most of these, it’s just the one that looks older is more expensive
In my opinion the "parmesan style" cheese (the cheap, fake) should be illegal to sell and produce so that the original and expensive parmesan cheese could be the only parmesan cheese avaliable in the market and i don't even tasted the original pasmesan but I'm ok with it
I can tell cheap from expensive by looking at the price tag.
Can we just appreciate how much she knows about cheese and how this video is actually very educational?  Also, she seems to be so sweet!  And her enthusiasm about cheese got me hooked up for the whole video! 😊
When I become a rapper I'll name myself "young goat cheese"  Its a bit *cheesy* though...
Has she ever gotten anything wrong?
I remember something from my ex that smells exactly like cheese. Uncut and nutty. Lol
I LOVE the crystals in aged cheeses❤
I like the part where she cut the cheese.
Living in France I am a wine and cheese and chocolate expert for life because it's cheap so why not do it!
The way she tells the cheese fact is more important than the price guessing
I'm loving these videos!
Switzerland isn't in the EU
3:59 she knows her cheese but not her numbers
DOES IT TAKE SKILL TO KNOW?
How can i be a cheese expert???
Me : has a test tomorrow  Now watching a cheese competition
Not enough cheesy jokes.
I hate blue cheese
If she is an expert .I'm Jon Paul II
« The UE subsidies to european cheese makers » And show a swiss cheese... And BTW you don’t have to be an expert for this, you only need to be French xD
I bet when she explains her job after the first night they understand why she had so much gas the night before.
Wheres the halloumi cheese?
Of course she’s a cheese expert. She has white skin and she is blond
She looks like a blob of cheese herself
kim jong un become honry by watching this
Those British countries stealing everything from the World and now they put Irish flag instead Italian... by my opinion this wasn't mistake!
i’m vegan why am i watching this
Is it me or was guessing the expensive cheese easy?
Did she really just call a Parmesan a Gouda?! Incredible expert lol
So old cheese=expensive
I thought some of them were pretty obvious
In 2007 I stayed up way too late watching reaction videos to 2girls1cup. Now, twelve years later, I'm up way too late again watching a young lady literally cut the cheese. Wtf has my life become?! Thx YT! 😠😪😂
Honestly this is really satisfying
I really admire how she knows the rarity of the blue cheese wrapped in leaf, like she actually know who made that blue cheese.
They used the Ireland 🇮🇪 flag not the Italian 🇮🇹 on the parmasean
But they all tastes the same on my pizza😋😛
what
1:19 did anyone else hear her fart
*The older looking are the most expensive! It was easy! Dont need to be a cheese professional to guess it* 😆
I think other than a good yellowy orange cheddar all cheese is mostly horrible, including brie, blue, camembert and cheese spreads. And white cheese is hideous. As is cottage cheese and god forbid Ski Queen and laughing cow. I don't like all Asian food except occasional Indian or Thai but at least the Chinese have sense not to eat much of it even though they eat awful stuff I could not imagine and I hate sushi sorry but I do. Eating what tastes bad makes these people look cultured or what. Im cultured enough I don't need to be more through cheese
Where is Rhett in this video?😂
Always pick the one looking like a moldy mop you’d never put in your mouth, those ones are fancy 👌😆
Im never going to look at cheese the way I used too
Female sexy rat
That "so" was weird 😐 6:31
I'm not an expert but I guessed all of them correctly, within the first 5 seconds of seeing them. It's rather obvious.
1:17 was that a fart???
Swiss is not really in EU xD
I’m lack toes in ants why am I watching this?
Smells kinda  *N U T T Y*
dream job
only that swiss is NOT EU. And I'm not sure cheese production is subsidised. In France, yes. But the swiss I'm not sure they do that.
cheese is a lil gross. it smells bad 💀
Thank you for making this educational. Wether we like or hate cheese, or even if we are vegan... info like this is important. We learn science and respect for other people’s love and dedication to their craft and livestock love.
"Cheese expert" what is wrong with this world
So what we learned today...most cheese that look worse are actually better. NeveR jUdge a BooK bY itS cOver
This video was really lazy...being able to see the aging process made this way to easy
I’m surprised nobody said “say cheese” at least once
i’m lactose intolerant and it’s 3 am what am i doing
1:18. She farting from eatin all that cheese.
I don’t even know what cheese is why am I watching this
Imagine telling your mom you wanna grow up and study cheese 🧀🧀🧀🤣🤣🤣🤣
I literally read Chinese expert guesses cheap cheeses vs expensive cheeses I have a problem
Charness yung ad. After she said im gonna guess b and about to pull off to see the prices with matching adrenalin music then the ad pops up hahahahah
I luvv cheeszeeeessz
I laughed when someone laughed on the background hahaha
*Why.. just why?*
YOU GUYS FORGOT TO SAY THAT GOAT CHEESE IS MOSTLY MADE IN BALKAN!!!
I want her to go groceries shopping with me and give me wise insights on my life choices.
Her anxiety in finding the answer is so relatable
Why did I get all of these right
she cuts so much cheese but doesn’t finish it :((
I thought that the title said Chinese expert at first... My life is a living flop. 🤺
That's basically me at home after buying a lot of cheese
Wait so what she's saying is that the uglier they are the better?
You don’t need to be an expert to guess which one was more expensive. If they looked fresh and like it came in a plastic wrap, it’s cheap
i literally threw up like ten minutes ago because i ate too much food and now watching this woman eat cheese (i hate cheese) makes me wanna throw up again, just saying.
I guessed these all right withouse tasting our smelling. Just looking lol.
I could smell this video
Goat cheese is so gross to me 😫
HOW DOES SHE KNOW WAT CRAYONS TASTE OR FEEL IN HER MOUTH HMMMMMMMM 🤔🤔
If being aged makes the cheeze more expensive she should just pick herself
How does one become a cheese expert
No one:  Epicurious: Cheese expert guesses which cheese is more expensive
That looks like the Ireland flag. Anyways, you can not compare italian cheese with united states “cheese”.
Why do I feel like being a cheese expert is the easiest career ever
Vegans r quaking
How does one become a ‘cheese expert’? “Hmmm this is some fine cheese and I do quite enjoy it maybe I can become a cheese expert”
I also fussed everything right😂 Yeah she knows her stuff well
I’ve been watching YouTube all day I go from football to cheese videos🤦‍♀️
now i want cheese and i don’t even like cheese
Oh what do you do for a living?       I’m just a *cheese expert*
She needs cheeses.
1:17 i think i heard a fart 😂
This video is cheezy
1:18 sound like fart to me..
she’s so excited about the cheese
They used the Irish flag rather than the Italian one on the label of the first cheese. Don't mean to be 'that guy'...
*my lactose intolerance is shaking*
WHERE IS MY BOY MOZZARELLA AT ??????
Im a food expert invite me to taste exotic stuff 😂😂😂😂😆
*MOM I FINALLY GOT A STABLE JOB!* *what is it?* *A cHeEse ExPert!*
smells kinda nutty
Girl, please learn to say Parmigiano Reggiano.  I’m from Parma and my ears are bleeding
I’m watching this at 12:45 am
Why not mention the name of the expensive blue cheese? I want to try it
madness parmigiano reggiano is basically the same price as normal Parmesan in England guess the transport really bumps the price up
Person: Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Me:
top ten most useless jobs to ever exist  10. cheese expert
Cool video!
Why does this lady look exactly like the type of person you'd expect to be a cheese expert
3:32 she said nutty lmao 💀🥶
My question is, how the hell do you become a cheese expert?!
Before watching this video I only knew two kinds of cheese: parmesan and mozzarella
why am i so interested
3:34 NUTTY
Man my stomach is acting up just looking at this
Her breath must be 🔥
Welp, she’s not a vegan
I'm lactose intolerant why am I watching this
How do you become a cheese expert like just spend your time eating cheese or something
Who else wants cheese now or is eating cheese?
who the *frick* ate moldy cheese and was like ‘uhh yeah this is it’
Those cheese spelling are killing my ears as a european
Halfway through the video I ask myself why am I watching this
1:18 sounds like a fart😂
She must really smell bad.
1.18 , Someones's farting
"What do u do for a living?" Me- "im a cheese expert"
Imagine if she got one wrong lol
Hey, what you do for a living. Yeah, im a cheese expert wby
Is it just me who was expecting to find chalk art in the blackborad? 🤣
I felt the anxiety when she was about to reveal the prices😂 'Please don't be wrong please don't be wrong'
I wanna be a cheese expert it looks like so much fun
I’m meant to be doing my homework why did I jus watch this person talk about cheese all the way through
Imagine growing up working as a cheese expert
Thats the flag of ireland and not italy at the beginning at the parmesan 🙂
I love cheese
first look i already know which is expensive i don't even need to taste. does that make me a cheese expert?
WHO STUDIES CHEESE?!
Wow I didn’t know that cheese can age
Her eye color looks purple wtf
Who got the Hyundai AD
😂😂did anyone else hear the fart at 1:18 😂😂 I literally can’t stop laughing!!!!
I want to do this for a living...I love cheese
That woman is so cheesy       And me commenting this is corny
Wow, she does know her stuff!
I like cheese but I’m lactose intolerant and it gives me acne🥺
Should she really be proud of being a “cheese expert”?
Sooooo you can eat erm old cheese?     And not die?
I'm a milf expert 😎

How fun trying cheese, if I take a bite of any of that cheese I will die ,
Only thing I didn't like about this is that when she cut a slice she didn't eat it all. I'm only saying that because I'm hungry and this looks good.

I'm no cheese expert but I guessed every single one of them correctly just by looking at them without hearing her comments.
I could've guessed them all right lol
Nobody:  Youtube: you like cheese
What i know about cheese is that the more mouldy it gets, the more delicious and expensive it is

Experts of chez
4:03 *3.3x More Expensive Not 5x*
As you can see all originals are european. As a half italian, half swiss I have spottet at least 6 issues, most consumers here would be more of an expert than her, no offense, it is just not part of US culture as ir is here in the old continent.
The thumbnail made her look like a kid..      That’s for me. How bout’ y’all?
Great recommendation YouTube
You don't need to be a cheese expert to recognize which cheese is more expensive
Vegan gang?
This is the exact opposite of The Cheese Challenge
Her V-neck tho... -I’m sorry, I’m dirty minded-

I love feta cheese because I’m Greek 😂🖤
Imagine making out with this woman...
I thought she was gonna do sandwich cheese lol :/
Sorry to be picky but the expensive goat cheese was not 5 times as expensive due to Cheese A being $4 for 4 oz and Cheese B being $20 for 6 oz
Wat a coincidence, an ad about cheese
They should've done this with the expert blindfolded ..
Damn. Bacteria is expensive
i dont really like cheese
I only know one cheese.       The good one. uwu
I like that she isn’t calling the cheap one “gross” or “bad” like the other food experts do. She actually gives when and where each one are good. I like here
just got a cheese ad Before the video start
I hate cheese.
Plot twist: she's actually a mouse
I could have guessed all those right just by looking, apart from probably the feta.
I could have guessed all those right just by looking, apart from probably the feta.
Oh! Rouge River Blue!!! Can only be made in Summer!
Well it is not that hard to tell which is more expensive
Please note that Switzerland is not a member of the EU.
Anyone else notices the fart at 1:18 ? =))))
Anyone here that doesn’t like cheese besides me?
Ok wtf is cheese expert?
"Smells kinda nutty..."      thats what she said...
lol the first two cheeses she said that A can only be made in some areas of Italy. But the flag beneath the price is irish, not italian 😂
Imagine being that good at your job
How exactly does one become a so called cheese expert?
How does one get a job as a cheese expert?? And what does she DO exactly? Besides knowing everything about cheese of course.
Plot twist  She’s lack toast and tolerant          Hehe I triggered some of u
I love that cheese knife
1:18 sounds like someone farting !!
Where’s the Sardinia worm cheese!!!
Epicurous: here is the cheese you cheese expert.  Cheese expert: I can tell that the cheese looks yellow   Epicurous: guys she is an expert
Person: What is your job?  Her: I’m a cheese expert! I tried to guess what cheese is most expensive in a YouTube channel called Epicurious the other day.  Person: Ugh.... 2019.....
I hate cheese
Bet her farts reek 😂😂
She go to cheese college?
i am a cheese expert now too
So the older, grosser looking and most filled with mold and yeast, is more expensive? Gross. Who buys these?
It makes me sick how sche says Parmigiano Reggiano
Youre not liz, youre Karen for now on.
Did y’all hear 1:19?
Conclusion don't judge cheese by its appearance
It's easy cuz of the looks give her a blind fold like da most of them are easy cuz of their looks
God rid  us of these "experts"
Rind= more expensive
2:57 trypophobia
It's funny how the ad I viewed before the video played was an ad cheese fillings
She even knows what the cows eat
the knife shes using lokks like cheese
I think all dutch people are cheese experts
Weirder=more expensive
where ratatouille at doe
Does she have purple eyes????
Only cheese experts would know All the cheese shown on this video  Rats:Our we a joke to you
I’m lactose intolerant
If I’m being honest this cheese episode wasn’t as impressive as other ones
"kinda like cheese candy"
She sure does look like a cheese expert
2:26 When you notice they swapped italy and ireland flag
omg sis just get to the point, which ones the expensive one??
This woman knows what she's talking about
I have an exam on ancient Greek literature and im watching this.
Oooonly in america
This woman could be an X-Men.
I like women who is into these kind of details or expertise. She's good about those cheeses.
I really like watching these videos with her. So informative.
2:24 that's not an Italian flag, that would be the flag of Ireland...
I have no idea of cheese and even I saw which one was more expensive every single time...
I got a cheese ad right before this video started
I'm literally eating Swiss gruyere and gouda with apples as I watch this
Literally why the hell is this in my recommended?!
She said cheese candy I’m done 😂😂😂😂😂
I thought the title said *chinese expert guesses cheap vs expensive things*
1:19 anyone else hear the fart?
She looks like she smells like feet
Does anyone think she looks like Clare from Modern Family?
So I guess if a cheese have rind its expensive?
Did they messed up the colors in the italy flag?
Me sitting here eating my baby bell
2:26 using irish flag nice
Idk you really need a cheese expert for this
Good looking cheese = cheap 😂
She knows like what animal its from and like its mothers mother like wtf
Cocaine expert?
Fuk I love cheese
Mousey
If that was me I'll be in the bathroom all day!
How do I get a job like this......
Why does the woman reminds me of a mouse?  Wait, it would make sense though...
I think its logical to blind fold her so that she'll depend more on the taste of the item
She's a rockstar
God dang this lady's a cheese expert but can't even cut it correctly without it crumbling 😭
Nobody: Yt algorithm:
Wow ugly cheese is more expensive and and richer in flavor. I am cheese
Imagine her talking to u with tht concentrated cheesy breath.
Milk do not come from cow, but from mother. Not your mom? Not your milk?
Did you use the irish flag instead of the italian one?! Ffs.
The way I cringed when she said 'regiano'
Hi I'm Liz Thorpe and in your cheese teacher
Does she know we have eyes right?
Anyone notice the flag of Ireland at the first cheese?
Im no cheese expert but i guessed it all!!!
They're too basic.
a cheese spread ad came before this video
I bet her farts smell like death
I'm just watching these now and this one doesn't have chalk art :(
The more vine I drink, the hotter she gets.. cheese ? who cares ?
Wallace would have done a better job
i dont know why youtube recommended this to me but here i am... watching this at 1AM... learning about various cheap & expensive cheeses.
They asked which cheese is more expensive not what type the cheese is
I hear she has a cheesy personality
No one noticed the Irish flag instead of Italy.
I guessed the most expensive one every time besides the feta cheese
Next time I get a cheese platter I'm about to pull up on my friends with the facts as I drink my $5 bottle of wine.
I just tried for the first time a high quality cheddar that cost me 5 bucks for a tiny square...  ...I've been so blinded by cheap cheese. It was mind blowing how strong the cheddar was.
I’m sorry but you don’t need to be an expert to find out which is more expensive it’s kinda obvious
I swear to god. Any video like this is so dumb. Pretty much everyone can ell which one is the more expansive.
What is your favorite Cheese? Mine is Saint Agur from France.
That's not the Italian flag that's the ireland flag https://youtu.be/lR-oJvKJyUY?t=144 🤦‍♀️
guys guess Bulgarian feta is traditional feta cheese not greek
I just wanted to say that I actually come from the region where parmigiano reggiano is produced, and I find that the more expensive Parmigiano Reggiano looks pretty bad, I honestly thought it was some kind of American imitation gone awry 😮 it probably has to do with the fact it was kept in open air too long? Anyway yeah, the visual difference with the other cheese is obvious, I'd never seen the other one and I'd never think it's Parmesan either
this cheese expert can get it
I bet this lady rips some serious farts
Part of me thought the whole “cheese expert” thing was a joke, but she really knew what she was talking about. Pretty impressive, I bet she can get good work consulting restaurants,
Poor cut at 7:33. Makes it seem like she's eaten from the same cheese twice
Why do they have the Irish flag for the parmigiano reggiano?
no bra... perfect boobs...
CRUNCHY WHITE CRYSTALS
......I love her.
How the hell is she so fit? Maybe I ought to eat more expensive cheese!
I wish they would list the cheese names in the description.
Why do they all look so much like their food?
HOW DO I GET THESE JOBS?!!!  CHEESE EXPERT. CHOCOLATE EXPERT.   WHAT THE HECK.
I like how she gets happier each and everytime she finds out she’s correct!
If she's an expert, she could at least learn to pronounce Parmigiano Reggiano correctly.  Also, that doesn't look like Parmigiano Reggiano,... PR has the name stamped all over the rind,.. while the sample in the video doesn't seem to,... the color is a bit off, too.
4:04 small nitpick. A) 4$ for 4 oz = 1$ per oz. .. B) 20$ for 6 oz = 3.33$ per oz. ..  Cheese B is 3.33 times more expensive, not 5
I can’t tell if that cheese knife is a brilliant or bad design.
I LOVE feta cheese. It's one of the only cheeses I love actually.
How is the first Parmigiano Reggiano is it's not made in Italy? That's not the Italian flag...
in either one of the videos (the new one also) we don't have any of these cheeses widely domestically made but with the exception of Feta (I had to search for the translation to be sure) and I most definitely love the sheep's milk one (goat is also okay, but somewhat sour and i like the sheep texture better) and any other kind of milk other than sheep or goat would be definitely a sin imo
Are any of these vegan?
So it seems, in general, that the longer it’s aged the more expensive it is.
How’s her breath tho?
7:14 - 7:39 , bad editing for the feta cheese tasting. Crazy how far this series has come in terms of clarity and quality.
WOW she's a Cheese Whiz!
Did she fart at 1:18??
2:07 I love this moment when she geeks out about a cheese robot
🅲🅷🅴🅴🆂🅴
Yo my last name is Thorpe too. I wonder if we r related?
she looks like Julie Bowen :3
So she said real greek feta is better but then at the taste test, she said A (real) tasted salty, and B tasted like olives ... Wtf!
Between this one and the newer video's, the chalkboard art has DEFINITELY improved, lol.
Lovely video... so interesting and informative!
Really?? I Got A freaking cheese ad for Philadelphia 😂😂
they shoudl put czech syrečky in there, test by smell XD
Her gracious giggle when she realizes she’s correct. 😍
I love the face Liz makes when she finds out her guess is right 😂
Im i the only one who thought she was unsure on half of them
1:18 Fart lol.
Wow. That chalkboard is sad. We need another cheese episode so we can have the proper chalkboard art backdrop
I can’t even afford the cheapest cheese fml
Why can’t this be my job!?! 😭😭
She should make a YouTube where she reviews cheese
"EU subsidizes cheese makers" Sure, but Switzerland is not in the EU.
She never named that last cheese.
This woman looks like the personification of cheese itself.
Man am I thankful for being European where good proper cheese is easily accessible and affordable...
A cheese expert that mispronounces Parmesan? O.o
Am i the only one who wishes to see a mud fight between the cheese expert and the chocolate expert? (I bet the cheese expert would win easily.)
Cheese is one of the best things in life. Oddly enough I love these but hate cheese that tastes like milk (that almost sour'ish milk taste/smell) not cheap cheese but just how it was made I guess.
The queen
Somebody has got to just reach up and grab one of them bottles of wine with the cheese.
Switzerland is not in the EU so that claim that 'The eu provides subsidies to europen cheese makers' is actually not applying here
useless and pointless.
I will always hope for anyone to review Queso Oaxaca ;;
1:18 did someone fart?
Beautiful girl. She could sell me anything.
Charlie kelly is THE cheese expert
horse expert guesses cheap (kill pen bought, maybe) vs expensive horses!
She is definitely not an expert she said that more milk is needed for a cheese made out of gout or sheep compared to cows milk - that a bolony because sheep/goat milk is much richer in protein and fat it take less fat to produce the same amount of cheese but sheep/goat produces less milk like 7 times less that cow does that is why cheese mage from s/g milk is more expensive coz  you need  more s/g
idk why but i love the way she says "rind"
1:18 anyone hear that?
When they get to different types of Ramen noodles, put me in coach
2:22 thats the irish flag...
still waiting for the 2 items to slide out and the expert points and says "that one" looking at the camera blankly, then the next 2 items slide out.
they need to rename this series 'American vs European' products.
Thanks a bunch for the video. :D
Does she ever not guess?
Who else just ate cheese
Cant wait to be rich enough to buy hella nice cheeses.
no cheddar ???
Personally i hate reggiano. Its just too salty for me.
We reviewed the (cheddar) cheese of the sea underwater on our channel, I would like to see her opinions on it.
Have you ever eaten maggot cheese? Casu marzu
The dessicated cheese is clearly older.
I'm 90% sure the expensive blue is Rogue River.
i'm in love with the cheese lady
Wow, this predates the gorgeous chalk backgrounds. And the newer stuff doesn't have the bulletin point lists or the country of origin flags.
She looks like cheese lmao
I had no idea I'd be so interested in watching this woman talk about cheese!
Cheez Whiz .
I've never seen one of these experts miss on any of them.  They make it pretty easy.
I bet she has the worst flatulence.
The price reveal should be equitable. When the reveal for the goat cheese happens, it's $4/4oz vs $20/6oz. She then says it's 5 times more expensive. That's not correct. It's only 3 1/3 times more expensive. The basis of this show is the cost. I would hope you would compare apples to apples. It is misleading to have the price for different weights.
We get only processed cheese in india🙁
Any Asians??
Panty sniffers guess cheap vs expensive stolen panties
That's one hell of a profession.
She is really a cheese expert, but I just can’t stop looking at her eyes for the entire video( ✌︎'ω')✌︎
Europe wins!
I think by far, Liz and the meat expert guy are the two best reviewers you guys have had for this series.
Cheese! 😍
but has she ever tried the maggot cheese
Back when there wasn’t any art chalkboard
She must be high parmigiana reggiano is 10.99 a pound
Marry me, we can eat cheese till the sun dies.
chesse expert 😄😄 and this ppl understanding?😅
Am I the only one who just only likes Parmesan and mozzarella only
A: hey, what do you wanna be when you grow up?     B: _cheese expert_
Is there a reason she always holds the cheese up to her nose in a strange way? I can't imagine how it would help but she seems so consistent about contorting her hand around when she sniffs.
YouTube keeps recommending me food vids as if it thinks I'm into cooking or something. Nah, I just like eating food.
Cheese experts are weird
When you guessed all of them correctly just because the ones you eat are the cheapest ones.
An irritating point is the absence of source information. The great blue cheese is probably Rogue River Blue, from Rogue River Creamery. It’s wrapped in grape leaves soaked in pear brandy. She mentioned that there are two leaf-wrapped blues. The other great blue cheese wrapped in leaves is Valdeon from Spain.
the more gross it looks the more expensive it is was all ive learned from this
I'm pretty sure the alpine on the right at about 5 minutes in is Pleasant Ridge Reserve.
She must have bio warfare going on in that stomach.
Why am I watching this
Ma non si dice "parimgiano regiano" Si dice parmiggiano reggiano
expensive cheese is like expensive wine, the nastier it is the more it costs
How dost thy become an expert of the cheeses?
0:47 AAAARGH! "Parmizhiano-Rezhiano" NO! There is no "zh" or "French J" sound in Italian!
5 millions views and 81k thumps up, and every single view and thump is well deserved.
dream job honestly
Marry me?
Right off the bat x50
For the Feta comparison, the edit shows her trying B both times...
Would love to see a tea expert video :o
there aren't enough cheesy jokes in the comments
Lol is that the irish flag on that chese
"Two shopping mall bries go rind the outside, rind the outside, rind the outside..." - Without Cheese
WOW she is EXPERT with a capital E.  I'm a BIG fan of Epicurious now because this is a professional erudite food review.  I have learned a tremendous amount of things I need to know when selecting cheese for cooking vs for entertaining when presenting a wine & cheese platter, etc. Nice!
God I love cheese
Do you like...have to go to cheese school...to become...a cheese expert?
The only reason i found this video was because it was in a cowboy bebop playlist
my butler makes me  grilled cheese sandwiches with the last cheese in the mornings, before my chauffeur picks me to bring me to my private plane.
Do you guys ever think you will do a price points on jewelry? Currently looking for jewelry right now and wishing i had some more info
Would love to see an olive oil expert please!
I love that when she saw the expensive blue cheese she practically knew the cow it came out of and how expensive it was.
Sonny hey love your show been subbed form along time
not focused
she's adorable <3
I thought FETA supports veganism.  Hahaha yet they make cheese from animal milk?
Try Gamalost from norway and lets see how tough you are 😂🤣
Feels like anything made in america = bad
3:59 why is the pricing for different weights? They seriously couldn't adjust it...
Always pick the cheese with a rind
dat  right goat cheese makes me super uncomfortable
Is this lady's job to literally eat cheese or is she just a major cheese enthusiast?
*tastes the cheese* Soothing creamy cheese melts in my mouth. I can tell that the dairy came from a happy cow.
what is that leaf-wrapped cheese?
After watching the bacon video and this one, I am hungry again. Damn it!
My, but what big eyes you have! ;)
They need to say who the makers of the cheeses are at the end.
My FromUnda cheese is pretty good, stong odor to it .
Cant beleive i just had a wank to a woman discussing cheese, im so ashamed
Do cheap vs expensive hookers.
This is an amazing concept for a series! Enjoyable, quick, and easy to follow.  One thing that saddens me a little about these videos is that the expert doesn't have much time to go into -what- the cheeses are.   If someone were to see this video and want to try any of these cheeses, they wouldn't be able to go out into a store and purchase them.   For instance, the leaf-wrapped Blue cheese could only be Rogue River Blue by Rogue Creamery in Oregon. They soak those leaves in pear brandy before the cheese is set to age, which imparts a strong sweet flavor and fruity notes to an intense blue cheese. It is only released from Sept-Dec and (in our store) can be found for 27.99/lb, which is definitely on the low side. It is one of the most unique cheeses I have ever tasted, and would recommend it to anyone whether they like Blue Cheese or not.   If you didn't already know what these cheeses were by looking at them, would you be able to go and find them in the store?
so everything but the blue was treated with the same variety of cheese going against each other while the blue was treated as some generic competition.
Though this cheese expert knows more about how cheese tastes than me, those crystals are calcium, not protein.
I keep watching this video- over and over again. I REALLY LOVE CHEESEEE
If your food looks ugly it is more expensive
why are all of these food experts so damn skinny? You eat cheese all day!!
Is a cheese expert Uses term 'Weird Robot Machines'
"5 times more expensive" XD $4/4oz - $20/6oz
Her knowledge is amazing 🧀
I hope that she hasn't stinky cheese feet
In the feta comparison, it wasn't clear which sample she was tasting and describing.
I want her to test what slice of Camembert is cheaper and what isn’t because I wanna try Camembert but I wanna know how people react to its taste…but there’s no Camembert in this vid
SMASH
Is it me or did someone confuse the Italy flag with the Ireland flag on  Parmigiano reggiano because its green white and red not with orange on the end
Have some cheese candy with your meat candy, sweetcorn and candy dessert. The only taste americans have is sweet, sugary or industrial. It's just so sad to see what you let them feed you. Why is it so hard to have regulations on production there?
This cheese was aged on a wooden Ikea table. The table was in a cellar. The table belonged to a Venetian grandmother and a lot of children. She lost her husband *pauses and tastes more intently* she lost her husband six to eight years ago. I can really taste the hope and the healing. I think that B is more expensive.

I know parmesean cheese too well
Frankly, I can't stand Blue Cheese. If you've ever had a case of black ants in your house and killed some by crushing, you'll know that they give off a very distinct smell when killed. Blue Cheese tastes and smells exactly like crushed black ants, and as such trying to eat it makes me sick.
Your light make-up pushes your natural  good looks to be seen not covered. Subscribed!
Is it just me or is there something sexy af about a woman who knows her cheese?
First of all you put the flag of Irland instead of the Italian on the parmigiano reggiano and then you are not a cheese expert if you think that parmigiano and the other thing on the right, produced in that country which I've forgot the name of, taste remotely similar :D
Never felt this excited and entertained about cheese before lmao
Imagine if she gets one wrong
If you really want to make it hard, put different cheeses of varying quality up against each other. Then one of the cheese should be frumunda cheese
She is amazing! But the editing... I think the pace is too fast for this content.
Can we get Zefrank to do one of these? "Because that is how a blue Cheese do."
I'm guessing this video is before they hire that awesome chalkboard artist.
Mom: what do you wanna be when you grow up? Me:A CHEESE EXPE- *Roblox death sound*
A ADVERTISEMENT SHOWED UP!
Thank you Epicurious for having Liz Thorpe back again!
Goat milk=white peaple Milk=Asian peaple Chocolate milk=African peaple
You don't have to be an expert to guess right.
Damn I wanna be a cheese expert.
I’m gonna binge all episodes of price points
Bad voice...
http://www.roguecreamery.com/store/product/1311/Rogue-River-Blue-Cheese-1-8-Wheel/ ;)
Wow she sounds satisfying. I could listen to her all day
Blue cheese is my absolute favorite!
she would be blonde...
Wow. You can make a profession out of anything. I literally just did a cheese haul. Here's the vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44BXaps3-I&t=114s
junky guesses good vs bad heroin
The goat cheese on the right is not 5 times more expensive, prices are per different weights. The one on the left is 1$/oz, the one on the right is 3.33$/oz
this selection of cheese makes much more sense than the other cheese test done by this expert
4:04 isn't 5x expensive, its 3,33x
shes gonna have some intense cheese farts
u know she love cheese dic
Srs, i can do that too... only by looking
An orangutan could pick pick the pricier cheese
And I’m over here eating my American kraft processed cheese
I'm a fart expert for women's
Ok, hats off to the cheese producer who uses grass fed milk and won over Swiss Gruyere cheese. That's remarkable.
I find these protein crystals in Parmesan cheese.....and my hair if I don't shower.
I eat cheese and then a fart 100 times and then i finally poop. Not because i want to but because i have too.
that was amazing.
I was totally hoping to see the traditional Pag island (Croatia) cheese. :I
I’m far from a cheese expert and I guessed all them correctly in a second as soon as each cheese was displayed.  The real challenge would be if she can guess those purely off taste, otherwise it’s completely obvious.
basically a fungus expert... no thanks!
I could guess them by looking at them
Excellent work. :)
Cheese tasting with Julie Bowen's sister.
So... Where and how do you make a living by being a cheese expert?
That's not an Italian flag *BRUH.*
I like this expert. Unlike other experts like the coffee one which equates price with quality, and the ultimate indication of what's the best tasting, this one recognizes the difference between the industry practices that controls price, and her own personal preferences when it comes to flavor.  Was pleasantly surprised that she found some of the cheaper cheeses to be her preference.
The flag for the parmisono resiono was an Irish flag
ew cheese. the only cheese i will accept into my food is mozzarella
I really love watching these videos. Could you make more of them please?
Cheesus!
We are living in a cheese state #cheeseinspector
Cute expert...
Wonderful! It's time for celebration... Cheese! For everyone!
Goat cheese is so gross
She has the knowledge of an average french 9 year old lmao
2:31
im not a cheese expert but i could have guessed which 1 was expensive
How many times did she say cheese in this video
Cheese
So at first look this one is wrapped in gold leaf and the other one is wrapped in toilet paper. I'm going to say the gold leaf is the more expensive one.
I live in USA. Where can I go online and order real Parmigiano from Italy - the good stuff? My local supermarket doesn't look this yummy. Recommended brand name would be nice.
Looks like she has purple eyes
She does know about cheese but math is not not her thing :D Love these price videos, keep em coming!
Right off the bat
I could listen to her talk about cheese forever, lol
What was the name of the leaf wrapped blue cheese?
Ive seen so many of these "experts guess" videos now, and no one ever fails. Im starting to think that they are told the answers in advance so they can look good. Why would all these experts show up and guess on someones youtube channel to look like foolish anyways.
this is all pretty cheesy
So the Swiss cheese is LESS expensive than the US one because of EU subsidies (let's forget for a minute that Switzerland is not part of the EU). And then the Greek cheese is MORE expensive than the US one because these subsidies are irrelevant all of a sudden?!? Are you making up reasons for these prices as you go?
1:18 Did anyone else hear that?
Last cheese is "Cabrales" an Spanish cheese made only in Asturias, a region of the North of Spain. It's enveloped in grape tree leaves. You're welcome.
She knows her cheeses, but her math isn't too good. The expensive goat cheese was only about... 3.3 times as expensive. She forgot to counter in that they didn't have a common denominator for her to compare them immediately.
So I'm a cheese expert then... And why are your cheese so fckin expensive ?
She is a cheese enthusiat not an experts. Fx parmigiano regioanno has minimum aging of 12 months not 18
do sushi please!!!
Wait, grass fed cow milk would make a more yellow cheese ? But I heard that back in the days (like Medieval era) cheese are more white, almost no yellow at all, and the yellow in cheese we see nowadays comes from coloring ?
Huh, so the more expensive cheese doesn't always means more delicious. I'm glad I could learn that now.  (I prefer cheese that taste saltier and milkier, like blue cheese, and I absolutely loath cheese that taste like crayon or candle)
As a cheese expert do you like all cheeses or are there still some that get to you?  I’d love this question to be answered but I don’t think it will be, given how many comments are here.
Did- did they show the Irish flag for Italy?
The goat cheese was 4 times more expensive, not 5 - the price was per a different amount.
Making her a grilled cheese must be hell.
Not even one french cheese, so disappointed !
Pfffft.  $4 vs $20... You don't need to be an expert to taste that difference.  Let's see these experts guess between 15 vs 20, something a little closer. This isn't a challenge.
Ummmm, ACTUALLYYYY, the more expensive goat cheese costs 3.33... times as much as the cheaper kind...not 5 times.
This is Internet at its finest, a pretty girl plays a fun game with cheese and speaks learnedly on it.  Well done!
Sorry, but I can't not laugh when someone says they're a cheese expert.  Charlie Kelly is a cheese expert.  He is also a connoisseur of milksteak.
"Kind of like biting into a crayon with little salt crystals in it"  And that's the more expensive one? Lmao
I CANT STOP WATCHING THIS
she is a cheese expert but always wears really weird shirts.
At 4:05 "5 times more expensive." As a math-oriented person, I can't help but say, it's 3.33 (repeating) times more expensive. 20 / 6 = 3.33, 4 / 4 = 1, 3.33 times more expensive.
Bitconneeeeect
hot
She's good at eating it,  but what about cutting it.... Ahhahahaha
I'm just a nerd who took a liking to cheese because there was a Belgian Bakery in my college town and I happened to guess all of these cheeses correctly except one. #SuperExcited
i just wonder what her breath smells like
“Smells kinda nutty.”    ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Taleggio is the best cheese. Fact.
The cheese expert is the best of this series
Have any of these experts been wrong?
Cheesy mold or moldy cheese is the most expensive
Been a cheese lover all my life. Just love good cheese. The uk has some of the worlds best
There is no such thing as ''American feta''. Feta is a copyrighted name and may only be produced in Greece. Calling it feta when it was not made in Greece is illegal.
You need Jefree Star on here doing a cheap vs expensive makeup!!
I personally like the knife. So cheesy.
After watching all these videos. I will surpass Gordon Ramsey in an analysis over many types of food.
Count how many times she says “right off the bat”
Is it just me or does she have a Sigourney Weaver vibe?
I literally read that cheese as a Chess And come here
I'm not a cheese  person so the only cheese I eat is American cheese but why in the world would anyone want to eat moldy cheese
I need her job
What would you call Parmigiano-Reggiano that's made exactly how it should be but is produced outside of Italy? Parmigiano-Reggiano-like?
Foot cheese is better
This was amazing! I want to follow this cheese expert around and take classes from her!
Cheese is life
Cheese experts? Now I've seen everything
This seems like a pretty cheesy video  .....sorry.
Small applause for the american gruyère killer.
Not 5 times more expensive since they are prices for different amounts of cheese.
Im literally just waiting for one of the experts to make a mistake 😂😂😂
Wow I feel so educated on cheese now
She can't pronounce the names right, or even try to
1:18???
how do i become a chess expert
She looks like Julie Bowen
omg who eats that much goat cheese at once
This was great, thanks, I've been looking for "how many combinations with 6 numbers lottery" for a while now, and I think this has helped. Have you ever come across - Zenulian Lottify Bonkers - (should be on google have a look ) ? Ive heard some great things about it and my brother in law got excellent results with it.
“Cheese expert”
Even my 12 years old can say these things.
i used to LOVE cheese, but these days the cheese i can afford is to sweet and after a few bites i gag ... i could eat a pound of cheese when i was younger in one sitting, at birthday parties my family even gave me a seperate plate with cheese on it, cause i would eat everything hehe it changed like 20 years ago, its quantity over quality these days, thats wat you get when overpopulated, i guess (visually i got 1 wrong, the feta)
Cheeses Christ
Could have swore I've seen the same video that was made one month ago.
Brie is cow milk not goat, and swiss is not part of EU
Lol they switched the Italian flag with the Ireland one
These are stock skills if you grew up in Italy.
The goat cheese isn't 5 times more expensive. It's 3.33 times more expensive. I win the maths Little Miss Cheese.
I wish I could taste these. Cheese is one of the greatest substances known to man.
i heard that they had to heavily edit this video because she was constantly burping and farting in the middle of sentences
I can tell you which from just looking at it ffs. Make it more difficult but like the idea of the video
the way they cut this video makes her look like she ate version B of the feta twice
I'm becoming a food snob.
Am I the only one that loves the smell and taste of Blue cheese and the dressing?
so im not a fancy white person  do u eat any of the cheeses with a rind on or do u "peel" it off
Is it me or did the flag for the parmesano reggiano look like the flag for Ireland
i dont like the idea of women eating cheese -- women should always be elegant and feminine....but the thought of chewed up bits of cheese coating the inside of their mouth, their teeth, their gums is very ugly, and unladylike. Women should not be allowed to eat cheese.
Do you imagine if all your high school teachers were this passionate about their lessons?
That was really interesting! Thanks for the great info! 😁👍
Greek feta cheese is to sweet and has a weird taste I prefer a nice lacticus bacilicus bulgaricus feta cheese, its like your in cheese heaven.
Let’s admit, we all came for that face
Switzerland isn't part of the EU...
she lost me at protein crystals lol
So jealous you get to get to eat super good cheese all day
For the Blue Cheese, the "B" cheese is wrapped in GRAPE leaves. (she said "some kind of leaf")
I´m really starting to enjoy these videos :) ... if only they wouldn´t make me so hungry :(
...at 4:00 it's really about FOUR times as expensive and not FIVE...but, nonetheless, A LOT more expensive...nice vid about cheeses
I think that the leaf wrapped bleu cheese is valdeon or cabrales but I would guess valdeon. wild guess the other one is maytag.
Eh not that entertaining. Would not recommend 2/10
Its more expensive because it’s got a tax and tariff and exclusiveness that makes the demand “higher” than the supply. But can it be made the same elsewhere.... yup
"Voting with your dollar"  This was genius and made me want to only purchase organic/grass-fed/free-range/ect… ORGANIC!
i only know cheese slice
When there are no more jobs on earth
She's a Trump Loving Cheese Lover!!!!
she cute
Darn, missed the feta. Got the others. I was ruined on blue cheese because I tasted the expensive one first and loved it. The second to me doesn't come close to the same flavor so it's not the taste that comes to mind so it doesn't taste right.
Really enjoyed this video, Liz & Epicurious. Liz, I love your brain and your language (verbal & nonverbal). Enchanting, to say the least. I would love to just sit, each night at dinner or after dinner, and learn something new every day. Of course, I would teach you something new from my knowledge base as well. I love learning from people who do things and know things that I know nothing about! Great video. :)
You don't really need to be an expert to figure these ones out, lol.
so basicly the older the cheese the expensive it is
Can you eat the rind
I want to try blue cheese but I'm allergic to penicillium so I can't have blue cheese
Her eyes look like some Snapchat filter...which is really cute!
I love feta cheese...+1 if you are from greece...I am😎😎😎. Που ειστε ρε αδέρφια!?!
lmao at the irish flag with the parmigiano reggiano
Experts with clothing (plain white T-shirts)
Cheese is absolutely disgusting.
I'd totally eat cheese candy.
Cheese expert??? This is a job now
I luv cheese....😊
Would have no hope doing that in the uk
u should blindfold her and asked her to taste it
A pity she had to bring nationalism into choosing cheese
Where is Cheese University?...I'd like to go there.
I died when she said it smelled nutty
FETA CHEESE ♥️
she is so beautiful 😍
love her, she's so cute!
anyone else keep picturing her getting diarrhea from eating all that cheese?
who copied who
I'm no cheese expert but I guessed all but 1 correct from looking at them.
honestly all i’d have to do to charge 25 dollars for a cheese is let it sit outside until it’s hard and disgusting
This video made me realize how hard it is to explain cheese without expressively using your hands.
Nothing says christmas like $50 moldy cheese
Well I'm lactose intolerant so I have never wanted to try any of these cheeses
what about donkey cheese
Anyone else not a cheese expert but was able to guess correctly each time?
I have no desire to watch this video but I’m watching this video
6:00 as a neutral swiss I have to say this does not look like a Gruyère at all..
I didn't take any lesson to know this things, I'm an amateur, but she did a good job except for the vocabulary. But to me, you dont know the most epic tastes of cheese if you didn't try the raw cheeses, to bad this crap american laws "protect" you from that, but don't protect you from pesticides and endocrine disruptors.
I got all these videos right and I'm not an expert, they need to be blind taste tests
Rogue. River. Blue.
Like se sei italiano e ti ha dato fastidio come ha detto “parmigiano regiano” 🤬🤬
Blue cheese is my favorite kind of cheese. Easily. I like pretty much any kind of cheese, but blue cheese is the best.
Please pronounce parmigiano reggiano
Where do you get all them cool knifes at ?
I actually liked this episode. A lot of times the answers are really obvious (like with the first two or three here) just from a visual inspection, which makes the reveal rather anti-climactic. However, there were a couple here that did actually need explaining.
"Alpine cheese", because Americans decided to call every cheese with holes in it "Swiss cheese", regardless of where the cheese comes from. Also, an American "Alpine cheese" that‘s more expensive than an actual cheese from the alps. Also, implying Swiss cows eat anything else than grass... Dear cheese expert: I hereby invite you to come and visit me in Switzerland. We‘ll go to the places where these cheeses are made, and you‘ll get to taste the best cheeses in the world.
This video made me go and ATTACK the goat cheese in my fridge, finished the entire log
She talks like a dumbo. Like, like, like, like.....
For the goat cheese, why was one of them price per 4 ounces when the other was price per 6?
She looks like a cheese 0_o
Imagine the cheesy jokes she has to deal with.
Does she think that brie is a goat milk cheese?
i guessed all of them right just by looking at them
Cow’s milk feta is just nasty
Cheeses seem to be simple. Ugly = expensive. Dirty = expensive. Smelly = expensive. :)
why do i love this so much it’s just so relaxing
impressive skills! she read those cheeses like a book it's crazy
did anyone else notice that they used the irish flag for the parmigiano reggiano instead of the italian flag
how does one become a "cheese expert"????
She laughs like a kid each time the guess is right. So cute :)
Your next video should be if these "experts" can tell the difference between black and white cards.
This is such a terrible show. They could at least make it closet. Anyone could guess these just by visual analysis
I have never in my life sat around with friends eating cheese. I've had dinner parties and work events and all that jazz but never have I seen someone get out cheese and just eat it on it's own or with some wine or somehing.... where are all these people having cheese-parties?
Correction at 4:03  The aged goat cheese "B" is 3.33... times more expensive than the unaged goat cheese "A".
Parmigiano vs. Grana!
watching this series i noticed how poor on food u.s.a. is. everything good is from another country.
I am learning so much about cheese.
This is so fascinating!
The only thing worse than this kind of “Purple Prose” talk is Sommelier Speak. — Wholly obtuse almost extra-ripe Pinot Noir. Strong kalamata olive, hoppy celery and aggressive strawberry jam. Drink now through 2016. — Redolent of plum with a hint of urine. — A good-humoured wine, benevolent and cheerful — slightly obscene, perhaps, but none the less good-humoured. How far can experts go in their metaphors?
Is she wearing contacts? Her eyes looked violet in the thumbnail.
Her eyes are purple! They're so beautiful 😍
3:32 *OHH IM BOUTA SKEET*
"B is my guess!:...cuts to unskipable ad....noooo!
How did I not know feta is made with sheep 🐑 milk smh 🤦🏽‍♀️
I'm not there yet, but definitely somwhere on the mountain lol
The editing continuity is quite poor in this, it's cut so she looks like she's tasting the same feta twice.
voting with dollars? why does everything have to be political for Americans
She should do another buzzfeed video like this one but they should trick her into eating gourmet vegan cheeses as well
i need more of these
I’m no cheese expert, but the ugly one is the expensive one
You can get it year round.. it’s a peñacorada
It looks as if they messed up the editing on the feta cheese. "A" was the olive-tasting cheese it would seem. They show her picking up the same "B" piece twice.
Anyone else feel like they could do this not being an expert?
Feta cheese    Women: "This tastes completly different"   Me: how so?
Liz you are a savant. I absolutely love listening to you. Thank you Epicurious for featuring her twice :) its wonderful to listen to experts talk about their passion.
I'm searching for the most funny comments about how the hell she knows all that
2:24 the Italian flag looks like an Irish one
These are BS videos. feed them pre-cut samples so it is less visual and all about the persons tasty skills
God i love cheese.....
They couldn't do the math to figure out price per ounce? 3:58
She got wrong a couple of things, Parmigiano Reggiano can be aged as little as 12 months not 18, albeit 18-24 is the more common. And Feta is actually meant to be firm and slightly crumbly, i'm shocked that the wet creamy one was even Greek.....i'd have guessed it was a knock off.
the older the cheese,, the expensive
how can you be a cheese expert and at the same time mispronounce parmesan..
does anybode care to write yet another *cheesy* comment?
I wanna marry her
Let's give her amul and britannia cheese :P
The background is fake. It's a green screen behind.
just call it mold lady
The editing makes it look like she tries B for feta twice and it looks confusing. Looks like she’s saying good things about the one on our right but then calls the more expensive one on our left.
Those eyes, those damn eyes
cheap vs expensive hotsauce
Why eat cheese that’s aged it’s bad for one’s health
Who farted at 1:18
I’m not sure why I’m watching this video I’m not a cheese person. Nevertheless I shall finish watching it.
next time green tea expert.
I never thought a cheese expert would be so pretty. It gives hope for all us cheese fattys.
take a shot every time she says “right off the bat”
2:24 well that's flag of Ireland not Italy
0:45 I am absolutely clueless around cheese; but if there's one thing I know, it is how to perfectly cut the Parmigiano Reggiano.
Love her! every time I watch this I wish she had her own show
The alpine cheese could be from Montana, because there are ranches everywhere, and pretty much all of it is grass fed, also, there are mountains everywhere
Any adult would know the  older  looking cheese would be more money duuuhhhhh doesnt take a expert
i guessed everyone right too? (just which was more expensive, but still) i could be a cheese expert
Her breath is probably horrible lol
Did't know Irish make parmigiano reggiano 2:25
She looks so bloated from all those cheese tasting
That editing, tho. It makes her look like she eats twice from B feta cheese.
🤮
Cheese expert
3:32 Yeah i get my nuts and cheese mixed up all the time myself.
YAY! CHEESE
I don't have children so I can eat better cheese.
*Right off the bat*
Loved this!
Stop torturing us with these expensive cheese :(
I'm training to be an assistant cheese monger, and today I got to slice and package (and sample) that same rogue river blue cheese- super cool to see it in this video!
Even though they are experts I still hope that they guess wrong 😅😅
This is making me sooo hungryyy
Cheese expert: doesn't know how to cut hard cheese
Why am I here.         I don’t even like cheese.
The extra “luv” and care that goes into a food produce should cost more; that’s very fair!
What, parmasan? What makes you think it’s pronounced ‘parma-jawn’? Such a pro cheese whiz, yet can’t pronounce a basic cheese name. Get outta here!
They got the Italy flag wrong.Hahahahahha.😅😅😅
Switzerland is not EU... :P (Though the Swiss government probably also subsidizes their farmers. But Idk)
Why is there a irland flag instead italy flag
hahaha all the knives she used were so cute
can imagine the smell of her mouth after the video lmao
GIVE me the cheese.
and breast milk turn into cheese
1:18 someone farted
This video is completely set up to jerk off the "expert"
so how do you become a cheese expert?
"I'm not there yet, but definitely we're in the mountains....somewhere...."
parmaSAN, not parmigiana
I know this is late, but please tell me I'm not the only person who thinks this lady looks like Earana from Oblivion.
I don’t see Rhett on here
Lotta self proclaimed "cheese experts" in this comment section😏
I want this job.
So... why is the Parmigiano Reggiano shown with Ireland's flag?
I find it  funny because in all those videos about meat I and my roommate always picked the right solution. The point is not for braging about it but I feel like europeans can look better at food and tell wich one is the real deal than americans (and its not supposed to be an insult).
❤️🧀❤️
3:31 smells nutty? u sure ur milking the correct part of the goat ?
I guessed all of these just from looking at them for 2 secs!
I would give her something cheesy to taste.
I just lost liters of saliva
I love       Cheese sooo much (I’m kinda addicted)
You're new.... Not much of a *rind* on you...
*bleu cheese
i am french and even by just looking at the cheeses i guessed everything right
PSA: parmigiano reggiano is pronounced with a j sound, as in jar. That soft g/sh sound is French, not Italian.
The older cheese is the expensive one.... Yeah... There's the point..
She farts at 01:18
the word "cheese" stops making sense about half-way through the video
I hate when people get it all right.
Cheeese
Blue cheese at the end is Rogue Rive Blue?  Wrapped in grape leaves mascerated in Pear Brandy http://www.igourmet.com/shoppe/Rogue-River-Blue-by-Rogue-Creamery.asp?src=froogle&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr7TspNaK3AIVhI2zCh1X8gHDEAYYASABEgIRdvD_BwE
Switzerland is not in the EU.
Where do you find these humans?
I used to think the only difference is whether or not it came in a can.
ALL of these Cheap vs Expensive videos are toooo obvious! NONE of them require experts!
Can someone explain that bleach experience with blue (bleu) cheese? Anytime i'm exposed to raw (un-tempered/not cooked) cheese, i *always* taste AND smell bleach. It's such an uncomfortable experience both cooking and eating with it, because the ability for me to eat and enjoy a meal for me is the difference in whether or not the meal is thoroughly cooked or heated properly. (Try making a burger with blue cheese crumbs as a topping when you cant get the meat to properly cook/melt the cheese...)
i want this to be my dream job.
1:13 how she know what a crayon taste like
Basically, the smellier, the more expensive
My favs: tete de moine, english stilton, red shropshire and delice de bourgogne. Recently i tried some basque cheese (from trader joes) and i added to my favs.A good manchego is amazing too. Nothing more amazing than a cheeseplate with some good wine and good friends!
Y’all I really want this job
All the Americans watching this are like "WHAAAAT?! It doesn't have to come from a can?!"
Life in general is "subsidized" in Europe, not just cheese.
This should be done with blindfolds. I am even tell just bye looking at them
its not dificult though :\
This is sooo easy! You Americans do not know anything about cheese
Dairy is Scary
All of these were obvious just from looking at them for a moment.  You don't need an expert to pick these out.
Good thing she's not lactose intolarant
Support america ripping off swiss cheese. What is original from America actually?
King of cheese here saying hi. Just had a Limburger sandwich ! Hit me up for the recipe.
Cheese is gouda.
"Cheese People"
Would’ve been better if random people did this instead of a cheese expert
Only a few months late, but afaik the crystals in aged cheese are predominantly calcium lactate and tyrosine. To be pedantic: those are small molecules – tyrosine's a component of proteins, but it's not itself a protein!
Enjoyed this, but Liz, at one point you said "you know your stuff" and then apologized.  You don't have to apologize; you're an expert and it is okay to acknowledge that.  I want to see this kind of stuff done by experts, not just anybody.
Oh I thought this was a joke video... It's not.
:/ I failed with the Feta... I knew it always comes in buckets fill with salty brine to keep it from spoiling and get that fresh look. the dry one looked fancier! :(
I'm French so I'm a cheese expert to !
Has any expert ever got something wrong in this series? I have not watched one where they got it wrong.
She says the Swiss cheese is cheaper than the American cheese because of EU subsidies, but Switzerland isn’t in the EU. Weird claim.
I love those knifes 😍
Expensive cheese looks and sounds gross.
I want to spend new years with her and splurge on some blue cheese.
I love it when the experts get excited because they realise it's a really rare or expensive product, a kind of kid in a candy shop moment
what no mozzarella?
Valdeon is a Spanish blue cheese wrapped in Sycamore leaves.  It is one of the best cheeses I've ever tasted.  Someone below says that the one in the vid is Rogue River Blue.  I can't wait to try that one.
Being something of a cheese expert myself, I would think the specificity of cheese as opposed to wine or beer or coffee would make it pretty doggone easy to tell cheap vs expensive cheese. For example, the first comparison...if I can't instantly identify Parmigiano-Reggiano by both taste and appearance, then I'm in the wrong profession. The second example has a Geotrichum Candidum rind, and by appearance I would guess that it's Coupole, by Vermont Creamery. That's what I mean about the specificity. I mean, yeah, I could make general comments like "this one has a rind and is therefore aged," but the fact is I know (or at least I'm pretty sure) exactly WHICH cheese it is, and how much it costs.  I promise you that Liz knows as well as I do what these cheeses are, but just can't reveal that for the video. Le Gruyere can be expensive, but choice B was obviously Pleasant Ridge Reserve, as any serious cheesemonger in the US would know, and it's generally more expensive than Swiss Gruyere.  This isn't like looking at a plate of light roast coffee beans, which could come from dozens of different places. Many cheeses are instantly recognizable, and someone of Liz Thorpe's pedigree will know what they are immediately just by looking at them.
3 minutes in and I'm thinking this cheese lady is hott.
You shouldn’t be calling it feta if it’s not from sheeps milk and to be honest Greece just like parmigiano reggiano vs Parmesan
They should do these tests based on only on taste, not appearance. After they are revealed you can explain one vs the other, but it should be a true taste test. That's more interesting in my opinion.
this is not not how you pronounce parmigiano reggiano, other than that, she knows her stuff! haha great video
I like the knives she used on the cheeses
Come on the ones that are aged the longest will almost always certainly be the more expensive ones.
If notice that there is a different knife for each cheese. Wow that’s crazy that one would need a specialty utensil for each cheese
OK, those white calcium dots in aged cheese are protein dots instead?
Her skin looks like a creamy ripe cheese.
So on every expert videos I’ve seen Americans kinda suck at everything except for that one cheese, they suck at meats and chocolates.......wow
So cheese one is a parmigiano Reggiano that can only be made in italy you say.. how come then this one apperently is made in Ireland? ;) (flag)
Bish how you know all dis crappa bout cheese
These videos are so fascinating. I wish they could call it which one is the higher quality and have the guests guess the price range or tier. Not guess which is more expensive.
Funny that all the more expensive cheeses were B
Yes but why is there the ireland flag next to Parmigiano Reggiano ?
How  tf does anyone taste cheese and say it’s fruity flavored
A woman of culture.
It smells a little bit *nutty*
Do Olive oil!!!
u farted @1:18
she says the got cheese is five times more expensive, but really it's a little more than three
Crumbly would probably be a better word to use instead of crummy.
Is older better?
4:05 wrong, it's actually ~3 times more expensive. The measurements are different per price. If we're talking 4 oz, then the aged cheese should be around $13.
TIL cheese expert is my dream job
Wrong flag for the first parma- thats the irish flag.
FFS!.....................Where's the cheddar?
2:24 That was an Irish flag not Italian lol
Not really an original video, pretty cheesy.
My favorite is aged, smoked Gouda. But it's hard to find both aged and smoked together.
Easy. The cheesier one is more expensive
Does she have her own cheese channel? An enjoyable learning and drooling experience.
Edit mistake! She tasted the same cheese in the clip, atleast it looked like that  7:24 7:33    I know she tasted both
I hate people who hate cheese....
I'd love her to try my fromunda cheese
How do you become a cheese expert?
She should try my cheese ;)
I saw a cheese wrapped in leaves and I hoped it was Cornish Yarg.  I was disappointed.
I'm surprisingly annoyed at how she cuts cheese, being an expert...
I was really into this
Im craving cheese now
She cut the cheese at 1:17
I'll stick with Kraft cheese 😊
Cheese porrrn. I ❤️ it ... almost as much as the knife porrn on the other Epicurious videos
Hmm.  I don't think I want to eat "cheese candy" _or_ "a crayon with little salt or sugar crystals in it".  😐
Can I have her job? Lol
Every time she mispronounces parmegiano / parmesan, I want to hit her with that hard block of parm in the teeth.
It smells kinda nutty
Got them all right just by looking at them.
Her kindergarten teacher: what do you want to be when you grow up? This lady: a cheese expert ofc. Her kindergarten teacher: great! Me: bish wtf does that mean?
Not good at maths, though, the second round she said the B cheese was 5 times more expensive when the first was 5 dollars for 4  ounces and the other 20 for 6 ounces. It is actually about 3 times more expensive.
In the first 10 seconds I here it’s really intense...HOW INTENSE CAN EATING CHEESE BE?!
I didn't know Miranda (sex in the city) was a cheese expert. Damn she's well rounded. A lawyer and cheese expert. In love.
That blue cheese in the leaves is the best imo.
Can I HAZ CHEEZE?!
No Manchego?!? How could you do this to me
Buzzed is already copying you guys lul
Where is the cheddar?
why did the parmigiano have an Irish flag?
Damn girl i saw that lerdammer all the way from italy how could you say the only difference is the color...
take a shot for everytime she says, "so right off the bat"
She can get it
There are many cheeses I don't like, especially when they haven't melted and I had difficulty with watching her eat them.
With cheese, the nastier it looks the more expensive it gets
at 2:27 they used the Irish flag rather than the Italian flag.
7:30 the edit went wrong... it made her take the cheese B 2 times. I thought a cheese expert would be a big guy......
I LOVE CHEESE
V     The and the other one Asalimdenny@gmail.comAsalimdenny@gmail.comAsalimdenny@gmail.comAsalimdenny@gmail.com
I came for cheddar, Where's my cheddar?
3:59 A is $1/1oz, B is $3.33/1oz, which is only 3 times different instead of 5 times.
If I can guess right just by looking at them in this video, does that make ME an expert?
"Cheese expert"
This is a video with smelling...
Did anyone else notice that the knife she used to cut the cheese (pun intended) looked like Swiss cheese
It’s so strange to see my city mentioned in an American video 😂 great explanation btw, very clear and interesting ✌🏻✌🏻
A wish for PRICE POINTS anchors: to obtain a salary for every correct guess of which ingredient variety is more precious.
Irish flag for Italian cheese?
Seriously, compare this vid with the chocolate expert vid. This woman looks like she's, like, totally right out of Highschool and, like, you know, totally, like, expert and stuff. This one cheese looks, like, totally more watery than the other one, like, oh my god, totally.  Just comes across as.. you know, not that experienced.
Like, totally
Why is this so informative
I want to go to a cheese and wine tasting party now.
4:00 No madam, that is actually 3.3 repeating more expensive, or the fresh goats cheese is 1/3 the cost of the aged.
"Cheese candy"... I think she's onto something
I love how excited she gets when she gets it right
blue cheese is never a good choice.
That's really cheesy.
I miss cheese. Allergic to dairy 😢
honestly she looks like what you would expect a cheese expert to look like
"Smells kinda nutty" **continues to eat**
Concerning crystals in cheese. They are *not* protein crystals. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_crystals
13 milioane scria pe voi
da baaaa , mistoo
I have a feeling that she was tasting the cheese more for pleasure than for determining which was more expensive, it seemed she knew just based on sight and smell. Cheese expert indeed!
She might know her cheese, but not so sure about her politics. I highly doubt Swiss cheese producers receive EU subsidies. Switzerland is not part of the EU, classic american ignorance..
I guess you could say she is.. *LEGENDAIRY.*
I thought this was buzzfeed
I just watched her butcher the first cut of parmigiana....
Why should anyone eat that shit😂
i wanna be a cheese expert
Did anyone else here a laugh at 3:22
Owh come on, only by looking at them you can say which is the more expensive one
Made in America.... Mostly garbage
the smellier it is the more expensive it is unlike my vag
I have watched this a couple of times. I dont know it's soothing for some reason. It gives me a bit of hope in some ways. That if you really put time and effort into something you really could be an expert on it. Gives me a bit of a drive in life. :D
2nd cheese, definitely not 5 times more expensive. $4/4 oz is $1/oz. $20/6 oz is $3.33/oz. So a little over 3 times more expensive.
"I'm Abdullah Rifai and I'm a cheese expert" Doesn't mean I actually am...
Best job ever
I think we can say that Liz is from Wisconsin.
Whatttt.....amaaaaziinngg👏👏👏👏....
In my country none of these garbage is considered cheese.
how can cheese taste like fruit xD
Tbh, this isn’t really a “talent” like the chocolate expert. Even I could guess which one was more expensive and I’m not old like her.
She says it like parmajohno it’s so annoying
All cheese tastes good
These videos are great. Cool channel.
No but I got cheese whiz
mmm milf mommy m&ms
Do you really need to be an expert to figure this out?
are cheese people like a cult of people who live in a mansion made out of cheese on some island no one has ever heard of?
1:18... Did someone fart?
Imagine being a lactose intolerant cheese expert.
damn just imagine her breath after this
I love cheese! English Cheddar first, English Double Glouster 2nd, Belgian hard cheese third, hard Asiago, Parmesan, real FETA.
First thing first - learn how to say Parmesan.
Ma quale parmesan cheese, Parmigiano Reggiano tutta la vita!
How about this kind of video for bread? sourdough bread?
Too bad im lactose intolerant 😢
I thought it’s blindfolded test. That’s too easy to just show her the cheese
Fetta(real fetta) is a combination of 2 milks..like 60-40 %%...i am Greek so...
You never said where the expensive blue cheese was from?
I honestly love watching your experts get it right. It lends so much credibility to your guests.
Turkish Kasar cheese and Ezine (white) cheese are the best, but very expensive.
my dream job
That moment on 2:24 when they put Ireland's flag instead of Italy's..not cool, not cool...
The closest comparison she makes is between the alpine cheeses. Both are raw milk, both are amazing, superior-quality cheeses. THE BEST alpine style cheese I've had was American -- Ascutney Mountain by Cobb Hill Creamery in Vermont. It's ridiculous. It glows yellow.
plz, do cheap vs expensive ice cream.
That first thing doesnt even look cheese
How cheesy
I'm no cheese expert but just by looking at the cheese I could pick the expensive one each time without fail. I would have preferred to taste them though as I love cheese.
She is the best expert I have seen on these types of videos. Well done!
How does blue cheese taste like???
*cheese(ust) christ* she knows her stuff.. i’ll go home
She looks like a brie.
Why the hell is cheese so expensive in america?! In germany/netherlands cheese is really cheap and most cheeses that acturaly taste good are not over 2-4 euros per package.
Me "Wow all these cheese facts are interesting, I should buy better cheeses" Also me *eats another cheez-it*
I only clicked on this vid bc liz is the shiz
I like how she is a expert but not a snob.
A cheese expert that pronounces gouda as gooda?
I'd hate to smell her breath.
I’m lactose intolerant can I still be a cheese expert?
Cheese is a culture
I keep clicking this video just to watch the part where she eats it
I hope this is a major
@0:43  Absolutely *not* a "cheese expert" if she can't visually distinguish between a Gouda (mispronounced) and Parmigiano Reggiano--especially if she can see the outer edge.
The aged goat cheese looks disgusting. Period.
She looks like she likes cheese ya know what I mean
This woman has definitely perfected her craft. I'm jealous because she gets to eat all these different cheeses and make money doing it. It's also surprising she's not a nerdy fat chick. I wouldn't ever picture a pretty woman being a cheese connoisseur.
I'm a cheese expert too! Give me lotsa cheese to taste test. I won't give any constructive criticism, though...I'll just tell you whether it's good or not. (I just want some cheese)
I myself could guess all of them right even though i couldnt taste or smell any of them and i aint even no cheese expert, i hardly consume any exotic cheese so i dont know if someone needs that much of a badass title to do all this... (Not a hater btw)
For most of the cheeses she knew which one is more expensive without needing to eat them, but still ate some haha
“This taste like the cow got into an onion patch”
more of these!!
That goat cheese was only about 3 times as expensive. Cheese expert, not hard maths.
nice video though i find it weird that humans still like cheese from meternal animals in 2018.... we should evolve and make nut cheeses from almonds etc ... but thanks for uplading, it was fun to watch.
Unfortunately most people don't eat good cheese. As a swiss I'm spending a lot of money on cheese and believe me it's worth it. And Americans, please don't call your rubbish cheese swiss cheese because it's not.
I love chesse This was very informative and enjoyable to watch
Have you really done a cheese video without french cheese ?
I'm basic with my cheeses. I like: cheddar, provolone, swiss, parmesan, gouda, fontina. :3
Girl you do know your stuff! Own it ❤️❤️❤️
Do a wine one
Did anyone else think that this was Cynthia Nixon?
I kinda hate the slow-mo effect when they reveal the prices. Makes me want to vomit. :P
Im extremly jealous of people who can eat cheese without getting pimpels
Lmao they used the irish flag for the parmegiano they could have at least used red instead of orange
"B" was more expensive every time.
This makes me very hungry.
You look like a cat lady.
I came because the thumbnail shows her having purple eyes.. Or that I must just be color blind
I'd love it if they make a video on experts in vegan and vegetarian food! It'd be interesting what they look for!
It bothers me that she doesn’t eat the hole thing that she cuts off
Why am I watching this I'm meant to be studying
Basically the uglier it is, the more expensive it is.
Had a blue cheese sample in a grocery store the other day. It reminded me of the time I slept on a moldy mattress and got a horrible cough for weeks. It felt like I could feel the spores in my throat (that's probably not what it was) and the aftertaste was horrible.
this girl had to have been homeschooled
Was there off editing in the feta section? Sounded like she was praising the American feta, when I thought it'd be the other way around.
I personally like these ones better because I feel like I learned something rather than the professional just stating their answer and moving on.
it would be a white person 👋😂
“Cheese people”
1:16 - 1:20 I think she farted, then the next scene she says, " It's almost sweet, kinda like cheese candy ". Valid point considering she is, after all, an expert in Cheese...???
Blue cheese shouldn't exist and you should feel bad for eating it... freaks
I know her breath must smell like feet. Lol
i know this is cheesy but you're good
Dicc cheese
I need cheese nooooowwww!!!!!
THE WAY SHE PRONOUNCED PARMIGIANO REGGIANO
Do more of these price point videos! I love these, but there are only three to watch!
Is it me or did anyone guess that the more expensive cheese is the one that was more labor intensive or more naturally made? So clearly it would be more expensive.
I feel like most people could pick the more and less expensive cheeses out by look alone. A blind taste test would be more interesting.
there's no such thing as too much cheese <3
I came here from the chocolate video and I’ll have to go back and leave a comment on that too. This was so enjoyable to watch because she genuinely seems to love cheese and isn’t a snob about it. She speaks well about production and uses in a clear and understandable way! You guys have picked great experts to make this videos, keep it up!
How does one become a certified cheese expert?
Easy, the more aged and darker, the more expensive it is.. I got them all
It should have been Rhett mclaughlin because we all know he's a cheese expert!
Anyone notice they used irelands flag isntead of italy in reggiano?
Anyonw hear the fart at 1:15
So if its moldy and look real old then its goos
Am the I the only who thought she was the mom from modern family at first
So informative!
If I was watching porn it would be better
I'm a vegan and miss eating nice cheese especially blue cheese :(
Expensive cheese looks disgusting
For the first cheese thats and irish flag
Now I want cheese!
That looks like Rogue Valley blue cheese... I can confirm, it is amazing...
So size wouldn't make a difference in cost as I am referencing the first one? They cut the Rhine off on one to make a perfect triangle. I won't doubt the taste but please don't make it obvious which one is more expensive. That is like comparing a hot wheels car to a motor vehicle.
Like biting into a crayon? Yeah i know that feeling
I've watched pretty much all of these style videos you guys have made, and I can safely say that anyone with working eyes could tell you the difference, it's always painfully obvious
sound volume pretty low
She is hot
I would not want to kiss that
All the experts have hair the same color as the food
Nice Ireland flag for Parmigiano
Did she fart? 1:18
I want some cheese now!
So the cheese that tastes like a crayon with salt crystals is the better one
Dame cheese well I mean people like all different type of stuff I guess
Did anyone notice that they put Ireland's flag instead of Italy's? 2:24
Fun fact: Milk from cow is actually a blood that been filtered  Also milk from a mom   (Sorry for my English)
A so called expert pronouncing Gouda as Goodah. Sigh...
I love goat cheese I'm hungry now
Lol the last cheese
Anyone else watching this while eating cheese?
Why do you put Irish flag on the Italian cheese?
The ugliest the expensive
Do one of these but with coffee
I can't have cheese it gives me acne..of all foods man
How does someone became cheese expert ?
5:07 she tested the cheese before reviewing
I need more videos like this
BRUH
leaves not leafs
All the smelly, disgusting cheese is more expensive. I personally don’t like cheese and don’t understand why someone wants to eat something old and yucky.
How is her stomach though
Tf kind of surgical instruments does she need to cut some cheese for a bite
Walmart vs Gucci
4:29 the cheese on the right looks like a lemon cake. Mmmmmmm lemon cake with vanilla frosting 🤤 Save a calf....eat lemon cake instead
I expertly eat cheese.
4:00 Technically, 3 and 1/3 times more expensive lol
I like dickcheese.
Recommended section sure is something
Cheese expert? Learn something new every day. O.o
by weird robot machines that are really cool xD
Not sure why we should be "voting with our dollar" on the American alpine cheese"? I see cheaper Swiss that uses classical methods and is subsidized to be cheaper as a BETTER option. I could be wrong...but on face value it seems to be better to buy cheap and classically made.
Am I the only one that doesn't like cheese?
So according to flags that parmesano reggiano came from... Ireland?
Soooo the really gross looking one is super expensive
blue cheese lmao
imagine if she didnt know what to say omg
cheese or cheesecake?
This is a joke. A so called 'cheese expert' would have name every single cheese in this video just by looking at it.
2:24 that is the wrong flag, what is this show doing, how can you mess that up. That's the bloody tricolour from ireland, not the italian green white red.
She's so surprised every time when she's right; YOU CAN DO THIS!!! HAVE CONFIDENCE!!!
I think the cheese got to her at 1:18
I knew it😏the uglier it is the more expensive it is😂😂
What next? CHEAP VS EXCPENSIVE ROCKS?!?!?!
This woman is amazing. She really knows her stuff!!
love this cheese woman
I wonder where you go to learn about cheese
Honestly loving these experts guess type videos.
Hey. I like these videos a lot. Keep crankin them out! Thanks.
Dam dis is cheesy
this series is so amazing
Terrible editing... make these 5 mins and people will watch.
i rreally want to be a cheese person.. i love cheese but all i buy are kraft singles and alll that other fake stuff.. i wanna get into the real cheese. from where do i start?
I want cheese now.
tea expert would be intressting
I love cheese, but blue cheese is just disgusting.
At any party, people love it when she cuts the cheese.
Erratta: at 0:34 your so called 'expert' incorrectly mentions "protein crystals". Those are Lactic Acid Crystals.  Fail.
I'm so fond of cheese I could have guessed right when I was 5. Yes I'm from france 😂
You can guess these just by locking lol
I'd like to see a Coffee Expert :)))
Today I learned that I should be a cheese expert.
The B goat cheese made me uncomfortable
I dont know why Im watching this, I despise cheese it is repulsive and the most disgusting food on this planet. It totally grosses me out like I cannot
Dream Profession.
Fart at 1:18!
Do you need a 3D printer , which can help you make more creative~www.facebook.com/wiibooxsweetin
Right off the bat
Stop making it so obvious on which is more expensive
To conclude, price shows the quality. If we want a quality cheese, get the expensive one =)))
umami
While this test was slightly less biased than the meat one,  they still gave some clues away by including the large chunks with the rinds. (And I know that this one was published before the meat one.) Even upon casual inspection, it was pretty simple to tell from the rind which one was probably the more expensive, with the exception of the feta, which had no rind. It was very interesting in hearing what she thought during the tasting, and I enjoyed her commentary, but I don't think this series is much of a "challenge" for these experts, at least in the way the format has been set up. I think that they could show the larger pieces to the viewers after the expert has made her decision from tasting visually similar samples.
do a wine one
I can tell just by looking at them and I'm not an expert at all.
It tastes like cheese candy 😩
*N O R I N D*
Why did they use the Irish flag for the parmigiano-reggiano?
Am i the only one who gets sad that she didn’t review mozzarella cheese, that’s my favorite cheese c’mon
Ok older aged cheese is more expensive, good job cheese expert 😒 BS job
I thought this was Buzzfeed!
Great video, but to clarify it's not important to support this type of food production as she claims. It's important to not support any milk or cheese production, for your health, the planet, and the animals.
Best part of the video....the Irish flag :D :D!
Um our cows are always grassing on the alps on big grassing fields, but ofc the american one is "grass fed" sure
I can't stand cheese but this was genuinely fascinating
Cleavage..
now i want cheese
"Gooda" "parmeshano reshiano" @_@ please take the 15 minutes to learn the actual pronunciation of these words...
4:04 - oops... she’s a cheese expert, not a mathematician
Was waiting for $500+ cheese 😔.   If not found mix in some truffles with gold leaves 🤑
Mold=good
In Asia we don't eat a lot of cheese, usually we only eat cheese in a food so we don't really know the differences of each cheese, this video is a really good learning video.
Has there ever been a vid where the expert guesses he wrong one
Is that last cheese rogue river blue? I believe it's soaked in pear liqueur. I've never tasted another cheese like it.
She really is an expert! I was hanging on her every word 🧀 bravo Liz 👏
I want her and the guy from the meat video to make a sandwich together
I dont like cheese but still found this interesting. Was thinking that it was lucky since I dont like cheesy that I dont live in a "cheese country" like Switzerland, France etc. Then I read up on it, and apparently we here in Denmark is the country in the world that eats the most cheese. I was born in the wrong place.
4:05 more like 3 times check your math lady :-)
I’d love to eat cheese for a living.
You amateurs, that's not italian flag at 2:25
Meg Ryan is a cheese expert. Who knew?
Don't assume that it was she who "cut the cheese" at 1:17. It could've been the sound or camera person. . .  or someone else.
I wonder If she got to eat the rest of the Cheese after Sorry misspelled “she”
Just sitting here watching a video on cheese, trying not to drool.  LOL.
I am no expert and I guessed all of them correctly. Why not challenge her if she is an expert? All of this was obvious even just by looking at it.
At the first cheese, you put the wrong flag. Your flag ( green, white, orange) is irish flag. Italian flag is (green, white, red).
Did she go to cheese school?
(More age = Money Cash Bucks Peso)
*so intense*
Come to Thorpe Park after dark!
4:04 "...five times more expensive."
I don't even eat cheese and only got the feta wrong
so much for the expert
*smells kinda nutty*
How does one become a food expert?
Blindfold her.  Make her smell the foot of a teen after a sunny day in cheap synthetic shoes. She will tell you it's the finest french Chaumes.
.... i'm hungry now ...
I don't know why I got sooo into this cheese culture videos recently, but I do enjoy to see them!
She's lactose intolerant
Cheese are my nightmare
Ik don't know but am I  the only one that could just see the most expensive on on sight
If she was lactose intollent 😆
Interesting how you never showed the US flag when it was the cheaper/not as good, more mass produced cheese 🤔
What happens to the cheese after the episode is filmed?.
*sound of french people screaming internally*     PS: I'm french, so I can relate
Sorry but Switzerland it’s not part of the EU. I am seeing a lot of bad errors. Parmigiano Reggiano is unique and cannot be compared to Parmesan which is fake
If you want something from Italy, please read all the informations on the product, these fake Italian products are damaging the Italian producers, we are talking about 60 billions € just for the food industry. Again be wise and get informed
Actually the goats cheese is only 3.3 times more expensive...bitch...I’m kidding but get your numbers right
lol they got Ireland flag mixed up with Italy
Time to nerd out with math - @4min (goat cheese) "all that work makes this cheese 5 times more expensive." The tags showed prices for different amounts in ounces so you have to convert to a common ounce denominator.  So, while she was right that it was more expensive, it's really only 3.3x instead of 5x
Cheesy made cheese
So basically you pay more for the more spoiled milk
Another "expert" who knows less than me (which I'm not an expert at all) #fail
I wonder how her cheese taste like.
I would really like to know the name of that American “Swiss” producer.  She said said to support it after all.  😄
The whitest job in all the land
Lol She isnt an expert when You Think a parmasan looks like a really old Gouda. Guesss You have to be Dutch to be An expert.
Can u eat the rind cuz dat looks foul
10/10 would cheese again.
Annoying chick
so the uglier the cheese the more expensive the cheese is
You come from the Parmigiano Reggiano cut by hand video, right?
normie
God you suck at food and geography...
I actually enjoy a drier feta much more than the creamy stuff.
Love how she didn't depreciate the cheaper cheeses. She can tell if it's industrial and if cheaper ingredients were used, but still acknowledges that they taste good.
taste kind of nutty ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The second one was only about 3 times more expensive not 5 times. It was $20 for 6oz vs $4 for 4oz...dats quick mafs
This lady really knows her cheese. =)
Its a Swiss  cheese knife XD
50 bucks for cheese ?! F*ck you@!!!!!
I'm losing my mind over all the different cheese knives.....
I find it disconcerting how she smells the cheese.
Pretty sure Liz Thorpe has forgotten more about cheese than many of us know about everything.
so i got them all right excepct one so basically im no expert so can i take those i got right home ? pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase :'( it's too much
3:18 😏
The last cheese looks like it's wrapped in Grape leaves to me.  Rogue River, maybe?
watched about half of it, then thought wait, why am i watching this? i dont care about cheese at all....
I dont want to be mean I have watched a couple of your videos now. And I'm a not a food expert at all. And I can pick out the more expensive one just from sight before the say anything.
I want cheese. Even some nasty blue cheese after watching this.
Woah woah woah. Left out in the open and unpasteurized? I don't get it how does cheese not make you sick
I loved her in Game of Thrones.
Actually also Gruyere is made with grass fed cow milk.
4:00 It's just over 3 times more expensive not 5.
You need to get a cheese-cutter. its such a travesty to watch the cheeses being slized with a knife.
"cheese expert". is there such thing as a better job. literally just professionally eating cheese.
wrapped in leaves? that would be elf-cheese.
they maybe made it too simple for her over here
Would be awesome to get the name of that last blue cheese (the expensive one).  I now want to try it!!
For the 1st cheese the more expensive one the Italian one had the republic of Ireland flag beside it.
girl gonna have them nasty farts tonight.
So no British cheese then?
Bro these tests too easy you don't need to be an expert to tell
I wanna know how do some cheeses get the sour/extra salty taste like feta cheese??
Firm
This video is so cheesy... Badum ts
How sad must your life be to be a expert on cheese
Anyone else likes cuajada?
She farted at 1:20
7:49 Yay my country won
this video was a lot more ambiguous which would be more expensive compared to the meat video. in the meat video you could almost right away tell which one would be more expensive, it was sometimes ridiculous even comparing the two meats. this video is definitely the better of the two
Are you kidding me... I got these all right just by the first look at them. Either everyone got this right because it’s easy or I should be a cheese expert.
The vocal fry was strong with this one.
I love cheese
This is so easy. literally most of the chesses that were old and ugly looking were more expensive.
from the cheese they used in this video, it doesn´t seem like you need to be much of a cheese expert to get the right answers, even without the taste and smell test you could easily identify the more expensive cheese from just comparing in the video footage... but it seems their jounalistic competence for this tv report end with the italian flag and starts with the irish one... lousy content for the brain dead...
She prob smells like a cheese too
Her and the meat expert should get together
Liz & the cheeses; delicious.
cool cheese mom
Feta is greek and americans cant top greek feta
Very good video, the "I" in "Reggiano" is silent tho ;)
"I'm a cheese expert" "it's either Gouda or Parmesan"  What? It's like a meat expert saying "It's either a bologna or prosciutto"
She is so cheesy
but where was the more expensive blue cheese from? please?
Lmao I guess all of them right by just looking at them. ''if they look grosser than the other then it's somehow more expensive'' God humans are stupid beings giving nastly looking cheese expensive price.
Here the real Parmigiano Reggiano: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI2eomeTsho
Goat Brie is so good
Honestly after seeing this video I don't think I'm gunna eat cheese again
No dutch cheeses? I feel offended.. lol
also $20/6oz is not "5x more expensive" than $4/4oz
if you're a 'cheese expert' whatever that self-claimed title means... then distinguishing cheeses isn't impressive. I'd hope my mechanic can tell the difference between a bmw and benz
Oh god. Goat cheese is the worst. Cant stand it!
Really interesting and informative.  Thank you very much Liz Thorpe and Epicurious!
For being a cheese expert she sure doesn’t know how to pronounce parmigiano reggiano
Lady how bad is your breath?
Did this make anyone else want to all of the cheese in their household in one sitting
I wish the makers were listed. I get a bleu cheese from a local farm that’s wrapped in fig leaves. It’s delicious & from The Sequatchie Cove Farm, in Tennessee if anyone’s interested. 5⭐️
i wouldn't kiss her for 10000000000dlls after this
She's so pretty 😍😍😍😍😍
The lesson is that the more the cheese looks like it was left in the corner of a damp cellar, the more expensive it is.
She farted at 1:19
The way she cut all the cheese bothered me
she farted in 1:19
I guessed them all correctly except for the feta without even tasting. Dont know why you would need an expert for that
Right off the bat
1:18 Did someone...cut the cheese?
All these answers are obvious.. you can tell the more expensive by looking at it
Salt and spice? There is no spice in cheese.
She ought to fart a lot.
you can just look at these cheeses and see which one is more expensive. The one that looks like it would kill you is the expensive one.
3:21 the little tihi in the bagground made my day
Her face and expressions remind me of John C. McGinley.
Am I the only person that notices how badly she cuts cheese for a cheese expert? #ThatTriggersFrenchPeople
1:18 Fart
Lmao that’s an Irish flag 🇮🇪 not Italian 🇮🇹
I honestly have no idea why I watched this..
i think that most of the americans have to learn first that cheese does not come from a can or plastic squares.
4:01 it is not 5 times more expensive lol it says $4/4oz to $20/6oz that’s a different amount of ounces
With the cheese shown here, I love that it's not unnecessarily overpriced ones but rather cheese where the price difference is actually explained through differences in quality and ingredients.
The first one looks like Gouda??????????
I'm digging this series based on the level of detail provided by the experts to explain what differs between the products. Even though you can almost always tell the difference between products at a glance, its great to hear a detail explanation of those differences.
honestly i'd rather buy the american feta simply because i'm not a huge fan of super salty cheese
Candy/chocolate expert please.......
There clearly needs to be blind taste tests..... I mean its ridiculous
The uglier it looks, the better it is 😅
She can’t do maths, doesn’t see the /4 oz bit
No brown cheese. I feel offended.
wow she looks like charlize therone...
Maybe start doing a blind taste test. You can CLEARLY figure which is more expensive just by look of them.
easy to tell just by looking.
She is so much more down to earth than the meat guy.
American Cheese is the best you damn nerds!
This channel is garbage. Do it blindfolded or don't do it at all.
I NEED THIS JOB!
Smash
shes so beautiful
Did i hear a fart at 1:17 ?
shes hot
So much better if it was a blindfolded taste test
Not much of a challenge when almost all the more expensive cheese are labelled B.
I looked it up and the blue cheese wrapped in  leaves is made by Rogue Creamery
This was a “Gouda” video
"I'm Liz Thorpe and I'm a cheese expert" I don't even know why I laughed
im sorry.. why are there *cheese experts?*
Tell me why you know how bitting into a crayon feels like.
cheesebae
Chocolate expert.
I'm honestly here because I'm a really big fan of cheese.
Just for the part at 6:45 she is awesome I agree whole-heartedly!
Man I just came from the meat one, and I just realized, I can't listen to blonde women talk for more than 2 mins... I must be sexist. ='(
why she know so much bout cheese
well im a sex expert .. :D ill know if ur a virgin or not hahahah :P
its so cute seeing her and the meat expert get excited that they got it right
Let’s add mold to this cheese and then we’ll eat it!
way off buddy
very nice video! thanks!
Me puts cheeses in mouth: yep, same cheese
If this was a buzzfeed video I would hate it
Giv' me da cheese!!
This video was "Legen... wait for it"   -  "DAIRY"
With the Goat cheese they didn't even compare two similar cheeses.... and nearly all of them were easy to distinguish just form the looks.  Also - what is up with those insane prices?!? i can get Parmigiano Reggiano for 29€/kg - half your price, and that from a cheese dealer with free shipping for orders above 50€......
These should be done blindfolded. I only care about taste and texture.
dont have to be an expert, i guessed all of these correctly by appearance alone
SMELLS KIND OF N U T T Y
lol someone farted at 1:18
I got them all right just by looking at them 😂
5:14 This tastes like the cow got into an onion patch
How isn't cheese incredibly dangerous to eat if it's basically congealed milk?
I think it really wasn't that difficult guessing them right by just looking at them,i got them all right except for the feta cheese.
i enjoyed her comments, as she made a point of noting that there is a "right" time for each of the different cheeses...one for a regular day, and one for a splurge. however, i wish these "expert guesses" videos included a blind taste test, because you can pretty much tell which will be more expensive just by looking at the two things side-by-side.
it really does annoy me when she's an expert, but mispronounce the names
How can you compare fresh & aged cheese??
If you like cheese, go to Gavin Webber's channel.  :-)    Become a cheese nerd.  :-P
Love it! I learned so much about cheese!
I liked this a lot, appreciating the cheaper cheeses for what they were made this feel much more interesting and useful than just thumbing your nose at the cheaper versions like a lot of connoisseurs might
4:06 is not even 5 times more expensive because a) says 4 pounds and b) says 6 pounds 😂
I really like how she didn't shame the cheapest cheese and was pretty informative. She's a humble expert.
7:30 - "All I taste is salt... it's like salty crumbs."  HAHAHAHA
Fart at 1:17?
Lady must not be good at math because A is 1$/oz and B is 3.33$/oz, not 1$:5$
4:05  blaze it
I bet she smells like death
the try to tell that american feta cheese is almost as good as greek feta but it's not. they take a "greek" feta from some market vs a good "white cheese" from some farmer. is called "feta" because is a protected designation of origin product and you HAVE to make it with ONLY sheep's milk, or a mixture of up to 30% goat's milk! depending on the place of construction also has variations to texture (soft or hard) and how spicy is it. Kalavrita, Kefalonia, Ipiros is only few of the areas you can meet this product at its maximum "performance"! "white" cheese and FETA are two completely different things!!...so...you dont know your "stuff"..
Am I the only one getting triggered by how she cuts most of the cheeses? So unsatisfying
If all it takes to be a cheese expert is to eyeball which of the cheeses are older by looking at the color and the state of fermentation... Seems like i am a cheese expert.
I want MORE! Pasta experts, Wine experts, beer experts, cider experts, Coffee experts, Cadies experts WHATEVER! I need more!
I love cheese but im lactose...
I am correct everytime. 😂
what do you call cheese, that is not yours?     *Nacho Cheese* get it? not yo cheese ha! ok i’ll stop
"I love this nice marble effect" Its moooooooooold.
I have soooo much homework, why am I on youtube watching this lady expert talk about cheese
Biting into a crayon and waxy is not my idea of good cheese.
Dr: What is the problem you're having? Liz: I I've wrecked 763 of my underwear. Dr: And what is it you do for a living? Liz: Cheese expert...
Glad that she isn't pretentious like other food testers. She didn't completely shame the cheaper cheeses and actually seem knowledgeable
what is that noise at 1:17
She is soo cheezy
Liz is fine but i wouldn't want to smell that breath in the morning.
You should do another one of these like with fabric can a someone from the fashion department derterment the most expensive by feel but from the original thing for example silk make them look touch feel the silk work see which one more expensive
Is that.... Ireland's flag?
4:00, not 5 times, 3.3
Do you think this video is...... Cheesy?
I can't wait to hear your cheesy jokes.
I like cheese and i like to try diffrent kinds, the one that i dont like is the blue cheese because taste like vomit lol ☠. I have try blue cheese in different places and even in dressings but just tastes like vomit 😝😝😝😝.
Irish flag instead of Italian. Sad.
If you’re an expert you don’t guess. You would know “right off the bat” which is expensive and which is cheap.
I bet this lady has some nasty farts
right of the bat
I can't believe I watched this video all the way
Parmigiana reggiano cheese grated on pasta is soooo good :D Kraft Parmesan sucks ballz. Taste like plastic
She loves to say “parmigiana regiana”
She got the price completely wrong on the goat cheese (see 3:59). It clearly said 4$/4oz vs 20$/6oz, which means that it's 3.33x more expensive, not 5x.
I just realized it doesn’t take a genius or even someone with decades of experience to tell cheeses apart. I can basically already tel which one is more expensive and I hate cheese. I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve tasted cheese in my life
She cut the cheese
Why do we need certain food experts?
yo epicurious, hire me, i'm an instant noodle expert
You can guess which one is more expensive just by looking at them
CHEESY jokes incoming
Basically what ever one looks older is  more expensive....
She’s not a cheese expert! Charlie is a cheese expert !
I only got one wrong, and I couldn't even taste them...
Please try expensive vs cheap alcohol (beer, whiskey, wine, etc)
i touch big bongos
Im getting a buzzfeed vibe and i dont like it
I hate cheese 🧀 but here I am 😂
I got them all just looking at them.
You could've got any Dutch person on the show and they would have done it for free! lol
right of the bat i can see that we all are wasting our time on just watchibg whatever
im not even an expert and i can tell you which is the more expensive.
1:17 wait did she just fart?!?!😂😂😂
How can a cheese expert pronounce Gouda as "Goo-dah"? Yikes.
Finally found a profession that still cannot be performed better by a machine, ironically farming is one of the first human professions.
I wil take fresh cheese over aged cheese any day. The flavour and texture is uniform.
She probably has the worst smelling farts
Did she fart at 1:17 ?!!?
Lot's of American rip off's of other countries intellectual property. Surprised she didn't make an all American Kobe beef, cheeseburger and have it with a glass of Californian Champaign.
quel "parmigiano" mi ha traumatizzato
No... 4:06, B was only 3.33 (3.SF) times more expensive.
editing problem around the feta cheese tasting, no?
She looks like a Barbara
i bet her farts stank af'
Dang she's good.
People here are arguing about the flags colours...
“In kazakhstan, is tradition we eat cheese before we talk.... my wife made it, from the milk if her teet.”
1:17 fart
"Cheese expert" who can't even pronounce "Parmigiano Reggiano" correctly. LOL.
Love to taste her cheese *-* if you know what I mean. Cutie! Great vid.
What is the brand of the leaf-wrapped blue cheese? It looks delicious.
I can guess all of these right, the dirty ugly cheese is the expensive cheese
1:17 Hmmmmm something smells cheesy...
1:18 fart
this is too easy
1:18 listen close she farts lol
Where is the Cheese from the Netherlands/Amsterdam we make the beste Cheese in the World
Nice idea to get 10min videos
which feta is the salty one and which one is the olive-y one? It looks like she got both from the American one. I NEED TO KNOW.
i Like Cheeeeeeese
This is great, its like Buzzfeed's worth it series, cept it doesnt have a flamboyant asian dude and his uninterested boyfriend hosting it. A show tht challenges experts' skills and shows common things to look out for in foods. Love it!
Idk for that first cheese but raw milk is illegal in Canada so is the cheese illegal
Smh I’m not even an expert on any food but I can tell which one is more expensive, not really that hard.
I love all the different knives she uses they are all so ridiculous
All these father and baby cows killed in the process 😢 GO VEGAN
why would you age something in plastic?
"i know my stuff, just kidding"... why? so you dont know your stuff?
i've watched this at least five time already..
Dream job tbh
No spray cheeses?
Imagine your relatives asking what you do for a living, and you tell them that you're a cheese expert.
3:21 Is that Michael Jackson's laugh?
Cambriezola is God’s cheese!
Everyone forgets about the world famous Brazilian Minas cheese :(
4:35 THE WRAPPER IS ON STILL ON A
They should have cut them the same size so it wasn't super obvious.
Why do I find this interesting?
10:16 was hoping a button would pop and "let her reveal".....
Imagine what her breathe smells like after this interview 😥
Who else heard the fart at 1:18?
Tell me more about the ONLY farmer in the world that makes the leaf-wrapped cheese!
Meat guy was way better than cheese girl
This is too scripted
The Feta breaks the rule that the uglier it is the better it is
Dream job!
Wensleydale?
Is it just me or is her eyes purple?
I like that in this series the expert is not a snob just because a food item is cheaper
You need to blind fold them. Even I can tell which one is more expensive and I can’t even taste them.
The swiss cheese wasnt gruyere, but appenzeller cheese..
i guessed all of them right just by their looks.
I just took a look at the cheeses and knew which was which
The 2nd goat cheese isn't 5x more expensive. It's 3.33x times more expensive. Gotta compare the same weight.
Grosser looking cheese = more expensive. Got it.
These videos are not entertaining nor are they really informative.
smells NUTTY lol 3:33
Couldnt she say WHAT that amazing blue cheese at end is called
im hungry i want to eat cheese
No Vegans were hurt during the making of this cheeeeeese video! :p
This was really interesting. I like this chick.
The cringe when americans say the word "parmesan". Its not "parmeshan", its "parmesan"
Does anyone know where I can go to buy these cheeses
what a job!
The nastier the most expensive
Special Party Cheese is the name of my Weird Al Yankovic cover band
Can I ask why the it’s the Irish flag rather than Italian
I’ve watched this about 10x times and idk why
Why can't Americans pronounce "parmesan"? PARMA ZAN....
As a swiss and cheese lover, i can tell that she is right just by looking at the gruyère and the american style gruyère We don't have a magic wand to make the cheese taste good. It's like anywhere else in the world. It's about the amount of work, love and time you put into something that's make it good. At 17$ you have the very basic gruyère that you can find in any supermarket here. If you want the high quality (and very expensive) gruyère, you need to taste "l"Etivaz". It's like a good aged emmentaler, taste like a fresh fruit.
1:18 anyone else notice the fart?
4:06 aparently she cant do maths
even i could tell the difference of which one is the more expensive lol
*_R I G H T   O F F   T H E   B A T_*
She “cuts the cheese” figuratively and literally at 1:18 😂
If she eat cheese all the time imagine what that kitty taste like
The farts she got after this video...
Holy Cow!! She knows her cheese!
Drinking game every time she switches knives take a shot
That was some nice Irish Parmesan
"It takes considerable more sheep's milk to make the same amount of sheep". I'm pretty sure she misspoke here and meant more sheep themselves are required. The amount of milk produces the same amount of cheese..I used to work in the cheese department at whole-amazon-foods
Wait, Cheese Expert is a career? Why didn't anyone tell me?! My whole life has been wasted.
its 4am and i am high af
Did someone fart at 1:18 ?
Should be a blind taste test
(Me, a self proclaimed cheese expert) *Given the Feta* Me: A tastes like feta *eats B* Me: B also tastes like feta Crew: Which one is more expensive? Me: uh...
Impressive, but god damn, "nice" cheese is so nasty
Is there a list of the cheeses shown?
An American cheese expert knows as much as a french 16 year old...
The slow mo reveal is cringe, someone forgot to shoot in 60fps and edit in 30
This made me grab some cheese from the fridge.
4:03 "All that work makes this cheese five times more expensive" ... $4 / 4oz ($6/6oz) vs $20 / 6 oz ... 20/6=3.3333 ... that's not even close to five times more expensive.
Why do I see Macaulay Culkin...
And here I was watching LinusTechTips and here I am watching someone eating cheese
Irish parmegiano reggiano?!   EIREEEEEE
My older sister watched this and was craving for cheese for 6 days      Thanks 😠
Proclaims to be a cheese expert, calls a cheese “Goooda” instead of Gouda...
this lady is so wonderful
Cute AF
"Good-ah" lmao
Irish flag at 2:24
Midnight: just one more video and im going to sleep 3am: CONTENT
No EU subsidies in Switzerland....
I got all of them but one it’s just which one looks older
Switzerland isn't in the EU, European continent but not European Union 😋
@4:00 it isn’t 5 x as expensive 4 for 4 or 6 for 20 is not a 1:1 comparison, the 4 for 4 is the same as 6 for 6..... so 6 for the one and 20 for the other, just a smidge over 3x the price... not 5x (3 and a third)
I only like goat cheese
Her breathe must be rank
Claims to be a "cheese expert".. can't pronounce gouda
iss a me mario regianialano
I don’t even like cheese and this is satisfying to watch
Besides using the wrong flag for Italy. You can't even count...  4:12 it's not 5times more expensive. It's 20/6oz and $4/4oz... there's a weight difference. Can you guys put in more effort to make the video ......................................
I love cheese and older women. She is beautiful. The lady is hot too.
why do you cut such a big piece and eat like 1/4 of that piece. Just cut what you wana eat. I hate people that eat cheese... so wasteful and pretentious
Some people in the comments were pointing out that the flag at 2:24 is an Irish flag when it should be Italian. They're right, but at 6:07 the Swiss flag is also orange instead of red, so I think it has to do with a printing issue or camera issue. I'm pretty sure they printed an Italian flag but the color got screwed up.
I don’t like cheese, and yet here I am
Wowwww I got every one right it’s easy just look what looks fake
I love this video. I love cheese and I love seeing other people get excited about cheese. It's especially fun to see someone know what's what with food really dissect it.
Cheese MILF....... internet wins again.
Cheese expert and Meat expert should date
Bleu cheese tastes like soapy doodoo to me I can't do it
I tried Rogue River Blue (the vine leaf wrapped blue at the end) for the first time a couple years back. $40 for a 1/8 wheel but as long as Rogue keeps making it I'll keep buying it for the holidays. It's worth it.
Her outfit looks like the designer gave up half-way through because of fabric shortage, it makes no sense.
Off-brand buzzfeed
These experts should have been blindfolded.  They are choosing based on visual cues rather taste.
“Right of the bat” she literally said that 3 times
shes good
Not really guessing when you can do a detailed inspection.  A blindfolded taste test would be closer to guessing.
Homer Simpson:  "MMMMmmmmmm..... 64 slices of American cheeeeeeese..... (drools...)"
Why are these even considered experts? I have chosen the correct cheese on sight right when they slid the tray out every single time. The meat video as well, I was correct every single time. To be fair though I am a pretty advanced home chef and I use these more expensive brands quite a bit.
What about cheap Gouda and real Gouda? Or cheap Mozzarella or real Mozzarella, ect?
I want to eat cheese now.
Really enjoyed this! Love her know-how and delivery. Thank you for enlightening me ☺
1:18 lol did she fart
What happened at 1:18? Anyone else pickup on that sound?
Parmigiano Succamydanno
Is it just me or when she said she needs to “taste” them she just wants to eat it
SPLURGE
i guessed the more expensive ones just by looking right off the bat. so ez
Constipation for life
Me in 10 years: chicken nugget expert
My lactose intolerant self is shooketh
Would've been cool if her name is Brie. Brie the cheese expert.
Just choose the older cheese or moldier cheese
Isn’t that Ireland
It easy I can tell to the more expensive got the mold outside and it darker
Me like cheese
The Swiss flag in this is orange, and the Italian flag in this is the Indian flag
I am one of the few people who don't like cheese (it is very bitter) but I learned things and that is always a good thing.
Why everything American is cheap?
Wow! She’s is so lucky she gets to eat cheese! I love cheese but I’m lactose intolerant
This jar of Velvetta I can tell is a total jar of spreadable Velveeta, because it has a lid, and says ‘spreadable’ on the Jar.
She's a cheese expert, not a math expert. 3:59
Her face makes me angry
The thumbnail makes me angry
Anyone know the brands of the cheeses so we can get them?
I need to just spill the beans, but I love every food except cheese.
WTF with the Gruyere - USA! USA! USA! How about growing up and saying its a better product because it is (taste, environmental impact etc.) rather than going all nationalistic. Trade involves reciprocity, compete on quality/price, not artificial divisions created by the elite to sustain their privilege.
LOL I dare you do this for wine.
Please, if you're a cheese expert, learn how to correctly pronounce the names of cheeses you're talking about.
MORE OF THESE VIDEOS PLEASE!!
anyone else hear the fart a 1:18 ?
Anyone noticed how they skewed the data. They had $4 for 4oz compared to $20 for 6oz
I dont want to hate but that old goat cheese isnt 5 times more expensive because you're comparing 4 to 6 oz
No rind outside , rind outside and dozy doe your  partner
and here i am eating my single slice cheese...
Does she also play 6pool banelings on starcraft2?
As a Greek I gotta say we also have cow milk feta difference is we just know how to make it taste beast xD
This has been one of the MOST enjoyable food videos I've seen! She was so thorough and fun!
Ah cheese. It's shortening your life but also increasing your will to live. That lady gets it.
Just bought a 1 lb pack of "imitation" sliced cheese for $0.99. No regrets.
She looks better than any cheese.
grass fed milk? can someone explain?
She looks like The Waitress from Always Sunny.
1:18 fart
Cheese "expert" can't tell the difference between an aged parmesan and an aged Gouda until she tastes it? Lame.
wow this expert is lit
She looks like Miranda from Sex and the city!
I’m in alpine
This video was like comparing a used civic to a lambo... They couldve tried harder to make it harder...... Like at least cutt a chunk of cheese away from the outside and let her tastebuds do the talking..
how does one become a cheese expert?
wtf
1:06
I really like her! She doesn’t sound pretentious and seemed genuinely happy and proud to taste the differences!
Damnnn😂😂the only cheese i know is eden😂
Am i the only one who guessed everything right?
Was i one of the only people who was thinking about the camera angles
That was cheesy
Idk how I got here, or why I watched this
i like how she reviewed the cheese. clean and detail
That parmigiano reggiano looked damn good.
Yo her eyes were purple
What in the pepsi colas did I just watch
1:18 was it fart sound?😂Use a headphone
amaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing!!!!!!!!!!!!! you are sooooooooooooooo gifted................
Automatic +1 for her because she doesn't come off as snobby.
Fun fact: It is against federal law to sell unpasteurized goat cheese, no matter how how healthy the goat or how clean the facility is, in the US.  You can legally sell unpasteurized cow cheese that has pus, blood, urine, and feces in it, while you can't sell unpasteurized goat cheese with none of these contaminants.  The dairy industry in the US is very corrupt, and has complete control over what foods enter the markets.
it doesnt take a cheese expert to look at the cheeses to know which is more expensive...you should have done a blind taste test
I just sat and watched an 11 minute video about cheese at 1:00 a.m.. I should be re-thinking my life choices, but I'm really thinking how long I have to wait before I can get my hands on some cheese and bread tomorrow.
1:18 who cut the cheese?
Plot twist: she’s lactose intolerant
10:21 $47???? jeez!     or should I say... cheese 😂
The appearance gives it away it should have been a blind taste test
Plot Twist : she's lactose intolerant 👩🏼👉🥛🐄🚫
can somebody please tell Charlie about this career opportunity
2:24 You used the Irish flag instead of the Italian one
This made me want to become a cheese expert, but then I just remembered I have dairy intolerance 🙃
that american feta should not even be called feta, its just white cheese, feta has quite specific production. I am eating feta cheese right now btw.
So the cheese that looks the nastiest is the most expensive.
No the goat cheese is not 4x more expensive, one is 20 per 6oz and the other is 4 for 4.
You don’t need to be a cheese expert for common sense this was obvious
Kim jon un is watching
I learned that Cheese Whiz with green stuff growing on it doesn't mean it's better.
I... wanted more information about the more expensive blue cheese? She left it like a cliffhanger. JUST TELL ME WHO MAKES IT AND WHY IT'S SPECIAL.
Am i The only one who could just see On The cheeses, before she even tasted it, which one was most expensive?
Except feta, the uglier the more expensive.
So basically the moldiest cheese is the pricy one
"I'm Liz Thorpe and I'm a cheese expert."  What a job. What a bloody job! :P
"I'm not that good" you just guessed what the cow ate.
Can you tell the difference between standard and name brand bleach? I'll be standing by, Chelsea.
White people in their natural habitat would be a better title
why is this a political video
I found my dream job
Parma --what now??
What am I doing
What I've learned from this video: complex rinds, creamy texture, darker/imperfect colour, fruity/multitude of flavours besides the salty cheese taste = more expensive.
Should have cut off the rind of the cheese and just grated it to do a double blind taste test.
smells like feet
The darker ones are the higher price. Doesn't take a degree to figure that out. Got them all. It was educational but wish it was more of a challenge to her. It would've been more interesting to watch.
I thought this was Buzzfeed at first but when I saw that the woman knew what she was doing I had to double check. Turns out I was right. The quality of this video is way too high to be something from Buzzfeed
Suddenly I wanna be a cheese expert. Would suck to learn all this then become lactose intolerant.
Cheese for the win !
I can't believe many families can afford $17/lb cheese let alone $47!
how do you earn the title of cheese expert?
I learned today that you don't need to be a cheese expert to tell the difference between expensive and cheap cheese.  At least in these situations.
Forget the cheese. I want her as a snack
Who is eating cheese right now....nom nom!!
puts some sloppy goat milk cheese next to a designed cheese. I wonder which is more expensive.
this woman is my idol
Cool video but I could have guessed all but the feta just from looking at it in a video.
I'm going to throw up if she eats anymore moldy cheese. Might as well go to my window seal and make a nice slice and put it on cheese. Gross no wonder why sickness is a thing
the video i didn't know i needed
she farted at 1:17 check it out
8:25 It is Bleu Cheese, not "Blue Cheese"
I got everything correct so i guess  i'm a cheese expert from the other side of the world.
This video has changed my life...I'll never look at cheese the same again!
Actually is knowledgeable unlike wine experts
she noses them sacrilege...
> cheese expert > saying "gudah" instead of "Gouda"
Cheese is cheese 🧀 Get a real job
1:18 TOOT
Last cheese... the leafy blue cheese is very comon in the north of Spain... in fact there are 3 towns that produce it: Bejes, Tresviso y Cabrales...
So I just discovered I'm a cheese expert... or wait, could it be fu obvious?
You should do a blind taste test since a lot of the hints she used were visual!
It’s officially my dream job
Off course is a difference, cheese use a huge biological and chemical proves.
The expensive cheeses looks evil
How does one get this job? I'm asking for a friend.
Cheese candy
JUST EAT IT GODDAMMIT
I watch this video and I learn so much about cheese now
I love cheese I put it on most of my food
i learned so much about cheese..
Who in the world just decides to become A CHEESE EXPERT, DOES SHE GETS PAID FOR THIS!?
Is it me or do I hear a fart at 1:18
What made me curious is that for every European cheese there is a cheap USA one,why is this. P.S.I love that they included Φετα(Feta) in the video.
you don't need to be a cheese expert ! Just be french  xD
Did she fart at 1:19
Now I want cheese
An "expert" saying obvious stuff all the time. Ridiculous
why should it take an expert with years of training to barely figure out which one tastes more expensive... what's the point of buying more expensive cheese if you probably can't even taste the difference
Imagine holding a child for 9 months just to have them grow up to be a cheese expert
I love how she actually breaks down every individual meaningful thing that makes the two cheeses different and explains why rather than only saying that it has a certain aroma or flavor. She explains the reasons behind everything which makes for clearer communication with the audience. She seems cool too. Def an expert
well now i know a few things about cheese, Why?, idk
she looks like cheese
she knows more about cheese than I've ever learned about math in my entire life
How tf do I get this job
Supporting deforestation for pasture livestock and the raping of cows and over breeding isn’t a good thing my dear
she’s amazing
She is my type
RIGGED
Damn I love cheese
The uglier the cheese, the more expensive
basically, like most region specific foods, parmesan reggiano can be replicated completely anywhere in the world. But of course they can charge more because the name.
most of these are visually obvious
Her training has really paid off. She can explain everything just from the top of her head, it’s truly amazing!
Okay so what was that fancy blue cheese?  I need to go buy some.
What a cool vid. Why does she require a completely different knife for each cheese? thats a lot of cheese knives.
I got all those right and I couldn't smell them or taste them. Soo when am I hired as a cheese expert.
wow she’s good...
11 minutes watching someone eat cheese. Wow. And yet I watched the whole thing
Did she just fart while cutting the cheese? 1:17
1:17 to 1:19 do you hear that strange noise?
just collect a few pinecones and then post a video about yourself to be a master expert collector
is it weird that I got them all correct?
why would you want crunchy cheese with a black layer?
Wow this actually taught me a lot about cheese AND she doesn't come off as a snob at all! Thanks Liz!!
She has nice skin for being a cheese lady.  Concerned about the gas, though.
half of those were kinda obvious for anyone that made tir own cheese
a little cheesy, but a pretty gouda video
damn i was 5/5
Some food experts are very annoying and acts like they can't be wrong about the food they are expert at but this woman... she is humble and seems like a really cool person ( and actually knows about cheeses )
I need a cheese major
take a shot every time she says "cheese". good luck
take a shot every time she says cheese
That's quite cheesey
I could tell which one was more expensive when I first looked at them, it isn’t hard
Should have been a blind taste test
Why am I watching this?? I'm allergic to cheese...
Why does she always cut off like four times more than she eats though?
You'd think the Parmiagiano regulations would say a thing or two about the state in which those Italian cows are kept. But none of the sort.
This wouldnt be published if she had got them wrong so cant see the point of the game, it would just show that she's bad at her job had she got them wrong and potentially affect her career, so of course she's gonna get them all right or this might have been scripted Not hating, this just could have been a cheese comparison vid instead of a guessing game
She is incredibly likeable
She cut the cheese many times in this video
I would love to hear more of her cheese difference and analysis classes like she did in the video. The way she talks and explain it was pleasant rather than arrogant. Not boring too.  I actually waited all minutes to see if she got one wrong but was weirdly satisfied that she got all right. She was an expert all right! :>
Is this me or she kinda looks like Willam Belli?
1:18 Cheesefart! :D
Worse looking, more intensive = more expensive give me my degree
Plastic kills cheese
You don't have to be a "Cheese Expert" to know which is more expensive. I did not even taste them and I got all correct. :/
Wallace would love her
Take a shot every time she says "right off the bat"
Wtf?? That American „Parmesan“ has the consistency of a European Gouda... O_o
Imagine you ask someone what their occupation is and they say that they’re a cheese expert...
I'm not a chesse expert but I knew which was more expensive
I'm a little sad they didnt do mozzarella.  I live off of that stuff with tomatoes.
This makes me want to eat a bunch of cheese
If it's ugly it is expensive
does she ever shut up
I love the different kind of  cheese and now I love her
Why am I watching this? I can't even name more than 2 types of cheese. I honestly don't even like cheese. I can't AFFORD this cheese.
Not much in defining quality.
this video is so white
Lol I don’t even like cheese.
I gotta say... she's really Gouda this.
I knew all of this and I'm hardly an expert.
did she fart at 1:18?
I though this Chinese experts
Two year old mouldy cheese, lol I'm sorry aged. You know you're rich when you pay primo for expired food that tastes like the bottom of a bird cage
you look like the woman out of weed with the cheesse shop
Who else loves her sapphire eyes?
2:24 oh my god should the flag on the left be the italian flag? Lmao how stupid can you be?
Mom: what do you want to be when you grow up  Liz: I want to be a cheese expert
Y'all notice her eyes or just me?
This video really pisses me off. Not sure why but I'm really angry while watching this.
Im sorry, but why is this a thing?
To me,  all cheese is the same,  and I hate them all,  I like the chemistry behind them though
Damn she's smart
Damn, I love hearing the way all these food experts break down what they're eating for the first time. Eater has pretty good ones too.
A-Am I a cheese expert? I thought the same things as her without even tasting it. Help. When did I become a cheese expert? When did this happen?
First on  I’m gonna have to taste to find out  Me: no you don’t YOU JUST SAID WHICH ONE IS OLDER SO CLEARLY THAT WAS IS MORE EXPENSIVE
this  video  basically shows us that which ever  cheese looks the ugliest is the most expensive
Fetttttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, I'm Greek 🇬🇷
You can kinda just look at them and tell
They used the Irish flag at 2:25 instead of the Italian flag...
THAT'S NOT THE ITALIAN FLAG
I got everything right just based on their appearance... i am a pastry chef thought =)
How do you like choose to be a cheese expert?
Is it me or I guessed all the expensive cheeses?
can cheese trigger you? cause B on the second round TRIGGERED ME SO MUCH    just me? ok
The rind is a little arrunge.
Pronunciation of Parmigiano Reggiano  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_amiZeNDsc0
Why am i watching this
I just wanted to watch a MW2 trickshot montage..... but i aint mad
Oh wow I couldn’t tell that it was old because it has mold on it.
What am I doing with my life?
Omg cheese is nasty
In the third cheese, just look at the side facing the camera. There is a yellow and purple piece of plastic. Just like that I knew its cheaper.
"Parmejano Rejiano" i cant stop saying it!! Hahahah
i'm a nugget expert
I’ve watched this 5 times.
So biased towards Us made cheeses whether its cheap or expensive.
Not sure this is a skill to be proud of
8:28 bLuE cHeEsE hAs MoLd iN iT!!!
i fell like you gould get anyone that's had chezz befor and they wold get almost all of theas right.
φεεεεεετα ωρεεεε
She really knows her cheese!
I don’t really think it takes a cheese expert to guess these tbh.
2:24 FFS THAT’S NOT EVEN THE ITALIAN FLAG
Got all without hearing the taste 👀🤔
Great video, really illustrative
"Parmegiano Reggiano"
4:26 how does one become a cheese person
Did anyone else hear the fart at 1:18? Someone cut the cheese lol
Her turds must be diamond hard
she looks a LOT like larry david's wife on curb your enthusiasm
She didn't guess a single thing, this is all scripted.
I clicked because I didn't know there was such a thing as cheese expert
Got them all right just by looking at them. Not a difficult test.
The expensive ones are so obvious
3:33 smells kind of nutty N U T T Y
I could easily tell them apart, the impressive part was just how much she knew. Aged cheese is always more expensive and you can tell a cheap fresh cheese if you eat cheese a lot.
I'm a meatball expert
Jesus im so high, i watched that whole thing
"So what do you do for a living?"  "Oh, I'm a cheese expert"
I enshoy sheese a lot, but shust when I washed it, I couldn't stand the way she's pronouncing Parmigiano Reggiano -  immediately I had an Inglourious Basterds déjà-vu - "Arrivederci"
Melted Mont d'or is the best chesse in the world. But even here in France it's hard to get a good one if you d'ont leave in the area of production.
Why am I watching this?
am I the only one wondering how to become a pizza expert 😂
This is kinda dumb lol shoulda blind folded her
Soooo old cheese is more expensive than new cheese....
Don't know why this was in my reccomended but I'm glad it was
Now ill be better informed when i go out to buy my Kraft singles
I could tell she's a cheese professional by looking at her
Cheese expert and she doesn't know the word translucent....Riiiight.....
I only knew amul and Go cheese brands and cheddar cheese.
Underwhelming af
Is it me or the little flag on the parmigiano reggiano is the Irish flag and not the Italian?
wanted it to be longer
I love how she explained how each cheeses are differently made from one another and I definitely learned something from her, besides looking at cheeses
This video smell cheesy.
The only one that you can't tell just from looking was the Feta.....it didn't really take an expert to tell with most of these.
The second set of cheese isn't 5 times expensive. The weight is different
gooda xd
Imagine what her boontie smells like
What I learned: the worst looking the cheese the more expensive it is
i know nothing about cheese but it was clear every time which one was the more expensive one
I need some cheese now I’m hungry 😭
3:33 NUTTY
If this is a true taste test then BLINDFOLD her and give her the samples.  She's able to pick the correct cheese with her EYES.
no cheddar ????
how can a yank be a cheese expert ? they only eat plastic cheese by kraft
But can he play!
cheese is like antiques. The older it gets, the more expensive it is.
Kind of annoying that careers like this exist.
This is a cheesy video.     Like if you like my Pun. Ignore if you hate puns.
I don't eat to much cheese and I'm not even close to an expert but these cheeses looked really easy to predict
I’ve always wanted to know how you get a job as a food expert
great video! i'll be honest, when i heard "cheese expert" i wholeheartedly expected someone who would be really pretentious, but she seems really nice!
Definitely Definitely Definitely Definitely
Nice!
my dik is so hard rite now
I hate cheese why am I here
Impressive.
As a swiss, I approve. Gonna have fondue tonight.
I just watched the whole video.. what am i doing with my life🙃
1:19 was i just me or did she fart?
I was right 100% of the time by looks alone. Yay
3:18, Lemony?🤔
tfw she said the alpine cheesemakers get subsidies by EU while the flag is a swiss flag
Cheese expert .. let me repeat that , CHEESE expert  Come on people
She is an expert but called it Greek Feta, when Turkey has just as big an economy around it?
Next time you should have money experts choose what’s more expensive. A dollar or a penny.
maybe she snapped
AHHHHHHH
Tuesday night? More like.....      BLEUS-day night!
I love cheese!! Marry me? 😂
So how do you make a living :/
To be a cheese expert makes more sense than a "wine expert".
it's like miranda from sex and the city, gourmet version
Cheese expert with totally wrong pronounciation. FAIL expert. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigiano-Reggiano
Woman "expert" =  opinion discarded.
I CALL A CHEESE EXPERT TO SEE OUR ROTTEN EDEN  CHEESE IN OUR FRIDGE    (CHEESE EXPERT COME)  (SHE TASTE IT)   Chhes EXPERT: hmmmmm Its very Complex,that CHEESE Would worth about $50000
I can't handle this video
3 cheese, A is more expensive
Let me guess, on the 2nd cheese, B is the more expensive
Ok the first 1 was obvious and I’m not even a cheese expert lmao does she get payed for this crap?
Tf is sheep milk???
Fake
Lmao anyone could have guessed this
These were easy af
Woah this was actually pretty interesting.
"Cheese expert" is one of the saddest yet most amazing things I've ever heard
I got all of these right.
Usually "food experts" just taste stuff and go "hm I dun like cuz A/B/C". She actually goes into the "science" of stuff and why its expesnive and how she distinguishes between stuff. Its actually slightly educational and interesting for ppl who love cheese.
She talks like cheese is the best thing in the world...
I could've told you that and they intentionally did that so they make it more relatable.
Ok
So usually darker cheese is more expensive and American cheese is cheap unless grass fed.
This was oddly satisfying to watch
i’ve found my calling
She is wearing a wedding ring which means somewhere out there a guy has to smell her cheesy farts.
I love how descriptive and into detail she was about the flavour and exterior
Good job Liz! 🙂
And yet I still hate the taste of cheese.
Old cheese is always more expensive.
Ss  Why did I comment this
I guessed all of them
I'm not a cheese expert, and I didnt taste any of these, yet I still got all of these right😂
I just got here from the buzzfeed mozzarella video. lol
Thumbnail had me thinking Cynthia Nixon was a cheese expert in her off time.
This is actually first time that i see someone that knows what the hell they're talking about. Of course you could easily spot the more expensive one. But she also explains kind of why it is expensive or believed to be more expensive.
Fart sound @ 01:18 cause she cut the cheese
Did anyone else get here from.that how to cut a cheese wheel video
I don't even like cheese
2:25 I didn't' realise Parmesan was made in Ireland
Why was this so interesting.like honestly
my  bick is dig
I could tell which ones were more expensive just by looking but I really enjoyed listening to everything she had to say about all the cheeses it was interesting
lmao did she fart at 1:18?
fake and cheese
It really doesn't take an expert to tell the difference between these cheeses. They are worlds apart in terms of aging, quality of milk and production process. With cheese, unlike wine, you usually get what you pay for, and any average foodie can tell the difference between mass produced young cheese and aged artisan cheese.
2:25 it's the Irish flag, not the Italian one...
Basically most are really easy to tell just by looking real quick. Less expensive look more processed
I wanna be a cheese expert
She was quite "cheesy" really.
Can't imagine her breath after that
For a second I almost missed the "scripted part”
I appreciate that this video’s expert truly showed knowledge of cheese: type, rind, color, consistency, and what type of animal or place of origin produced the cheese. I know very little about cheese and this was quite informative, what with letting the cheese expert share her knowledge rather than the typical “we fooled the experts” videos that seem so popular. It was refreshing to watch an expert be an expert.
my kind of job
She kind of looks like Holly Flax from The Office!
She’s like a cheese sommelier
DO MORE OF THESE PLEASE
My face when they put the Irish flag instead of the Italian flag
That wasn’t a Italian flag
now i want cheese
That’s 11 minutes of my life I’m never getting back
She looks like a cheese expert
What do you mean cheap? I only see expensive vs. hella expensive.
I feel like I’m a cheese expert now...
Her knowledge of Cheese is deeper than Mariana Trench
The way Americans pronounce parmigiano oh boy
im surprised shes not a finger wiggeling expert
PARMESCIANO RESCIANO Hahahahahahahahaha XD 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
2:27, wtf is the Irish flag doing there?
Shoulda thrown a vegan cheese curve ball at her
3K dislikes from cow
Blue cheese is disgusting
This video was fun and this woman's amazing- I loved listening to her. But if you know anything about cheese the quality difference was obvious at first glance...
like, her knowing the type of age was impressive. but when started about what kind of container it was made in, whether it was aired, and what animal was used, WHERE it was produced, even what the animal was fed..... BY SIGHT. she hadn't even tasted it yet. ridiculous.
closer to 3 times as expensive not 5
That old goats cheese was creepin me out
I actually learned stuff about cheese, I didn't come here to learn but whatever
If she thinks that "$20 / 6 oz" is five times more expensive than "$4 / 4 oz," maybe she needs to take some time off of cheese tasting and go take a math class.
The one that tastes good must be the expensive one
I really enjoyed watching this. I love seeing people talk about things they are knowledgeable about! She is great.
I bet her fingers stink
Disgusting!
the swiss cheese was actual better.......why? because itsnot made with grass like the dutch chees, who is incredible cheap compared to theamerican product and has the same taste, it wa sjust a bad couple to campare a mountaincheese with a flatland-cheese. feta is different by its brine and not by the milk. there are cheap geek and turkish feta in cans with a lot of different brine.
I can smell this viedeo
I do know my stuff . . . . . . Just kidding
She is good. Demonstrate her professionalism
I can pretty much say that I am hungry looking at those cheeses.
I don’t like dry cheese or any cheese except mozzarella
I guessed every single one just by looking at them. This wasn’t hard.
You can't say American feta...feta is a Greek product and made with sheep's and goat's milk from Greece ONLY...There are not exist feta with cow's milk... It's not feta...Even if you make it from sheep's and goat's milk still you can't call it feta...Feta is a protected designation of origins product and you can call a cheese, feta when it's made in Greece with Greek products only....
Im lactose intolerant so her explaining how it taste helps
she reminds me of elizabeth olsen
She most definently farted
"you're voting with your dollars" very true
damn she knows her stuff
I don't want old expensive cheese it doesn't even look like cheese it looks like it spoiled long ago so it's not appetizing for me
I wish I knew as much about anything as this lady knows about cheese. I'm impressed
So how does one go about becoming a cheese expert?
She meant connosiur right.....
just wonder what is more smelly between the cheese or her armpit 😋
Anyone disturbed that THAT Parmesan is milk that has rotted to a crumbly solid?
how did i get here and watched the whole video about cheese. i dont even like cheese wtf :D
she said cows milk comes out yellow yet all the milk I buy is white :(. now I hate dairy but Love white women.
I loved this video. Really informative, she's pleasant to listen to and not pretentious. She's a cheese nerd instead of a cheese snob.
Smells kinda *_nutty_*
Now I want to go back and get that log of blueberry goat cheese I found at Costco. It was big, but if I eat some everyday, I could probably get through it. (Get the smaller ones at Aldis all the time, but sometimes they don't get finished because I buy like five different cheeses at once.)
Lol I’m from Switzerland and Gruyère is not considered an “alpine cheese”  here  :) still delicious though! Must say this expert was really enjoyable and this was such an interesting video!
i could watch her talk about cheese all day. no shame.
Just choose the old one and it's expensive
The goat cheese rind looked so gross- But I still wanna eat it.
I want cheese
I would like to get a good cheese and a good baguette and have lunch with her.
why did i watch this? i'm lactose intolerant
Jesus Christ that Parmigiano Reggiano pronunciation
she's the most entertaining person to come to this channel
im no expert and I guessed every single one.
The one that tasted like crumbly crayons was more expensive than the one described as creamy?
she looks like shakira
I hate the word "splurge"
An original video for once.
this is honestly SO cool!
Wow she's passionate!  Really informative!
that's bull she's already done this and then she recorded after
how can she call her self a cheese expert when a 10-year-old can see what one looks older "wow this one looks older it more $" she a frud
She has my dream job. I would marry in a second.
*”I know my stuff! No just kidding.”* HAHAHAH mee
i hate cheese but this fun
So many different cheese tools
Nice. I’m actually impressed by cheese. That’s a first.
*watches 1 video about cheese, thinks he is a cheese expert*
That’s an ivory coast flag not italy
1:18 Dafuq
I was always right
Does anyone know the name of the American company that used grass fed cows milk only
I liked her a lot, and I would definitely watch more of what she has to say, about cheese usage and selection, and her favorites for different applications, and what cheeses to splurge on.
1:18 did some one just fart
I got a neutrogena Kristen Bell commercial before this 😂😂     Uhh they both have blond hair, blue eyes 😂😂
PARMIGIANO REGGIANO IS THE ONLY CHEESE I LOVE AND EAT IN ITALY AHDHDH
I really enjoy this video
She said "It takes more sheep's milk to make the same amount of cheese," when talking about the feta.  I think she misspoke.  She probably meant to say "It takes more sheep to make the same amount of cheese."  The same amount of milk will make the same amount of cheese.
would make more sense to do it blindly. you dont need a cheese expert to know that the cheese is aged longer therefore its more expensive. Atleast with vodka tasters, youre not given any hints just by its appearance. She didnt even need to taste the cheese to know the answer
4:05  yep, $20/6oz is definitely 5 times as expensive as $4/4oz.  $3.3/oz is definitely 5 x $1/oz. for sure
I have a 1 year old cheez whiz pot in my fridge selling it for 50$.
why would you eat moldy old cheese tho D:
She honestly went off...
crusty cheese .. **throws up**
She clearly knows what she's talking about, but how do you even become a cheese expert?
Whyyyyy??!!!!!! Did you pronounce Gouda like gooda??????? I can't ughhh.... I get that you can't pronounce the G but ahhh atleast prounce the OU right say gouda like OUT.
thats an Irish, not an Italian flag.
We need this to be done blind; the appearance gives clues.
Her life must be every rat heaven!!!
I'm a fruit expert
I can be a cheese expert if it stinks looks disgusting and tastes like very strong feet it is the more expensive cheese (except for feta)
Was anyone else more interested in the utensils than the cheese?! No ? Okay...
Everybody can tell the difference only by the look, come on guys
that expensive goat cheese looks like my nuts
How can you compare goat cheese with Brie? American cheese experts...
Are her eyes dark blue? They're gorgeous
She said reggiano wiredly
I wanna make lover to her then share a cheese platter
Now i wanna eat some cheese...
Do it again but blindfolded!
I came here from a pellet gun review
damn she's good at what she does
1:17 did she fart?
I started to die when she was like “I HAVE TO TRY IT” Also at 1:19 WTF WAS THAT DID SHE FART LOL
Who else was crying and screaming through out the video saying 'don't put it in your mouth.... It's OOOOOLD'
This made me want cheese so bad!!
very educational
there is no american made feta, just sayin... "feta" is like "champagne" u cannot call it "feta" if its not made in greece, just like u cannot say "champagne" if its not made in champagne... simple really... the american version is just "white cheese". i know i am splittin hairs here, but since this video is all about cheese, i thought it has to be brought up...
Ok I could have told you which ones were more expensive
She should be in an anime
I got all but 1 right
Easy expensive cheeses have more of a strong fine taste
charlie kelly would love this woman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcN7SGGoCNI&feature=share
Mom: what you want to be when you grow up?  Me: Cheese Expert
I hate being lactose intolerant 😭😭 i love cheese :(
90% of this was based off of how the cheese looks, which is common sense. I'm in the wrong job.
Based on looks alone its pretty obvious which one looks more expensive
I liked the utensils she was using .
"right off the bat"
I learned so much today. Wow. I WANT CHEESE NOW
I love cheese.
Who farted at 1:18?
Watches this video starts reviewing yellow cheese slices
Shes so entertaining! The way she explains things are not annoying or something.
I never knew about feta being made from either cow or goat...fascinating
She's hot
But what assurance do we have that this is not scripted or she rehearsed this beforehand? I would've guessed all these too and im no cheese expert. Gotta question things.
Take a shot everytime you hear the word "cheese"
Mais c'est d'la MERDE
cheese expert points out the visually obvious
I never saw/knew/imagined of someone that was paid to know and eat cheeses. I feel i failed in life!
The parmesan cheese had the Irish flag on the label. Was that an error and it should have been the Italian flag? Or was the cheese produced in Ireland & not Italy?
I would just devour both cheese  cheese lovers where you at? 😂😂
she looks like a cute mice
i want cheese now
i love how she carries herself and the way she talk unlike some 'experts'
thanks
Man I wonder where she got her cheese diploma from?
Im willing to bet that the first cheese from the US was Rum Runner, a parmesan style blend thats brined in rum giving it some sweet characteristics.  (I work as a cheesemonger in a supermarket chain)
Twas too easy. Got all of them right but one and guessed just by initial inspection. Raise your cheese game
i love cheese.
Don't even need to be an expert
thought this was a chess video this is awkward
"Crusty"
Next: Porn expert compares free vs paid porn
dident even had to taste them, noticed the difference just by looking at them.......
*I've become cheese expert after watching this video*    cheese lover here
im a cheese expert too, i am dutch so yeah xD
a goddamn cheese expert. well damn im gonna be a tapwater expert.
I just realized her knife looks like cheese
do u guys think shes vegan
excellent.  she was right on the money!!!
Pretty easy. More aged = more expensive.
The way she pronounces Italian words made me cringe so much omg lol
you shouldnt have shown the cheese before the tasting.. Its obvious which one is more expensive and as we all know, the eye eats also
She's talented!

Parents: What do you want to be when you gros up? Me: Cheese expert.
How can you call this goat "brie style" ?? It looks like st Marcelin / st Félicien. Brie (cow) has a dry rind, those are humid.
I'm a huge fan of cheese, but I gotta keep it real witchu chief, aged sharp cheddar is my all time fav
I was right every time. It’s looks looks are everything.. in cheese xD
She’s a blonde Teri Hatcher.
The more expensive host cheese actually wasn't 5 times more expensive because it was the price for 6 and not like the other one 4 ounces
I clicked by accident really and thought it would be boring but I really enjoyed learning about cheese 🤓
The 2 firsts was obvious.
Oh I'm a cheese expert too. And I HATE cheese
This is too easy to her, she just came here for the cheese
This is breast milk mac and cheese
Does she poop, ever?
Do more vids with Liz! she's good.
I can’t eat cheese
its funny how "grass fed" im the USA is a rare thing, it's more or less the standard in the UK!
This woman needs her own show/channel. I would sub to a cheese channel in a heartbeat.
I could have guessed these just by looks tbh
Anyone else watching this and thinking damn this is what white privilege looks like :P cause I was giggling like a school girl watching this woman that took this amount of obscure knowledge so seriously, like the last type she goes oh leaves , some wife beater in a forest in East Germany makes that or something, like seriously its just amazing just looking at someone with so much knowledge on something so mundane, its actually amazing someone is this rich.
Who else thought of Claire from modern family at 4:03
This seems more legit than any other food or drink "expert" I've ever heard
everyone of these cheese's you could of guessed which one was more expensive just by looks... she should have done a blind taste test or something cause each one that popped up i was instantly able to go " that one is more expensive cause look at it ... it looks intense compared to the other one" ... i know shes an expert and i know shes got the skills but by looks i think a lot of people even amateur cheese lovers could have guessed which one is more expensive
she's hot
plot twist the government employs her to choose cheeses that help hide food poisonings
Called them all on visual...Think I should get a new career going.
I read this too fast and thought it said chinese expert
Why does the knife change each time?
I’m sorry cheese expert?
In my country, Alpine Cheese is called Queso Paipa
what isa theese? Cheese - borat 😂
she didnt say where the blue cheese came from. it looks like Cornish Yarg
think she likes cheesy feet
I didn't know cheese could be so interesting.
Why was there an irish flag instead of an italian at the parmesan
Why was I able to know all of them?
I’m no cheese expert... and I still was right with every guess on which was more expensive. The hardest one for me to guess was the feta.
What I actually loved about this is how the cheese expert isn't snobby at all, even though she could've been.
Here I thought this was going to be a small sample test. Not a no kidding test.
i thought it said chinese at first...
Wow it is soooo hard to tell you don't need to be an expert always choose the cheese which is more aged.... I storing of cheese will cost the company more money and in the end it is more expensive.... As I said you dont need to be an expert
Now if she was blind folded...
i never knew how much i wanted to be a cheese expert until now
More uglier and its more expensive cheese
Learn how to pronounce these cheese names
Cheese Bee is more expensive
Φέτααα
I hate blue cheese
Take a shot every time she says “right of the bat...”
This made me crave cheese
Ehhh she's nice but I feel like a person here in France would wipe her in the floor with cheese knowledge. Very basic cheeses in these tests. Missing roquefort, etorki, chaussee aux moines, camembert, tommes d'auvergne. :P Even raclette cheese.
Why do jobs like this exist?
I think I’ve fallen in love
She can taste my cheese if you know what i mean hihi
I hate the way they say parmegiano regiano
Whatever looks older..states stronger..is more expensive
Ahe sounds like menasha please
Cheese making is an art. A very annoying but delicious art.
BUEN VIDEO Y MUY BUENA EXPLICASION DE DIFERENCIAS SALUDOS DESDE MEXICO 👋👋🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🧀🥖🍷👍👍👍
i lov her
Guess the cheese on my knob
I wouldn't eat the aged goat cheese by it's appearance alone, looks really creep
cheese? that is some stone age stuff... its time to leave that in the past. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcN7SGGoCNI
She might be a cheese expert but she doesn't know how to pronounce names of cheeses she is evaluating.  She refers to the outside edge of cheese calling it a rind, it is actually a German word meaning edge or crust and the letter "R" at the beginning of the word is rolled on the tongue to properly pronounce it, but most important is how to pronounce it. It is pronounced like BEND or MEND, not like Rind which sounds like FIND or KIND. She is correct in asserting that Americans really can't make quality cheeses, low quality soaked in chemicals. YUCK!
for the first one why did they use an Irish flag not an Italian??
Damn I love cheese
wheres the carzu marzu maggot cheese
Jesus I hate her vocal fry.. there is no reason to make your voice sound creaky on purpose.
That was easy by looking at it
Youtube knows me far too well.
How does one become a cheese expert?
She's lovely
"Your eyes dilate when looking at something you like" She must hate cheese lmao
OK this is my dream job, how do I learn and apply for this?
i want to be her friend
really wmf cheese knifes...
Who else learned more than they expected😂😂😂😂
shes great
She's making cheese sexy!
can she tell if it is the chesse from my nails
I would love have your job. I love CHEESE 😍😍
WTF is a cheese expert😂😂😂
4:00 Cheese B is not 5x more expensive than Cheese A, it is 3.33x as expensive.  Because A is for 4 pounds, while B is for 6.  Edit: Ounces, not pounds
Literally its 1am and I’m lactose intolerant what am I doing
I read this as Chinese expert instead of cheese expert
I need to eat cheese rn.
How does one become a “cheese expert”?
I loved you on Modern Family
Loved this!
Man she is gorgeous to me
is it me or does she look like a blonde teri hatcher?
So what do you do for a living?  Me: I’m a cheese expert
Why was Cheese Whiz not included in this test?
7:35 thumbnail
I was guessing and surprisingly got all but 1 right! I kinda just chose the old/darker one and that strategy seemed to work. Please don't hate on me.
I can guess all of the cheese b’cuz I’m a cheese😍
I wish I lived in civilization. I guessed all of them right by only looking at them.
I never heard pf cheese ppl xd
i only got one wrong
If you guys love watching someone with a cool personally describe food and taste a bunch of delicious stuff, check out Simon and Martina. They are a couple from Canada living in Japan and make very fun food videos :) (not an ad.. I just love watching easy going and informative food videos... I love food ^^)
basicly if it looks old its expensive.
Only here because I thought it was the cheese lady from Christmas office party lool
Macedonian or Bulgarian feta is what I usually buy, just tastes better to me.
It nothing like a Tom & Jerry Chesse
I got them all right. I’m 14, have no knowledge of cheese, and didn’t taste them😂
I like this woman
Cheese goddess
She's got nothing on Rhett (From GMM) lol jk
Is it just me or does she look like Claire from modern family
FOR SOME REASON I THINKING IM WATCHING BUZZFEED..IM NOT
I don’t even know how I ended up here but I just learned a lot about cheese
Only white people would have a job like this
im not an expert, but i could tell which was the most expensive, every time
I played the game along with her so far everything right...I’ll edit for final results...     Edit: 1 wrong
What is it with White Women and their obsession with Cheese??
Oh my gawd! I want her talent
Right off the bat
FINE I’LL WATCH IT YOUTUBE
the alpine cheese sounds like the cheese in ratatouille
Don't come with "I do know muito stuff. No, jk" Yes you do, ma'am, and you should be hella proud and unapologetic 👏
types of cheese I know:  cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese & cheese
i still like spray cheese
COOL JOB
So right off the bat...
I like cheese
Is it just me who guessed the cheese with her? :'))
Cows work hard! 😯
They must've told her beforehand. If it was a man, they would've made him look foolish.
so is my cheesy jokes expensive??
I guessed most of em based on how much mold and if they had a crust it’s not hard
Wowwww she’s so admirable ☺️
i don't even like cheese that much but i watched the whole thing
I like cheese I eat a lot of cheese   I AM A CHEESE EXPERT!
I want her to review all types of food in the world! Please give her a tv program of a YouTube channel.
Not even one minute in and I'm already triggered by how she pronounces Gouda and Parmesan
Bruh number A on 1 looked like a rock
So basically the more disgusting it looks, the more expensive.
why is this in my recommended 😂
She knows everythin i mean *EVERY CHEESE*
Another One       *Knowledge*
What a worthless skill, she knows what type of cancer is more expensive
Too easy to tell the cheese, if she was a real cheese expert one look she can tell what it is without tasting them...
They expend something like a thousand dollars in cheese.
Fake test.  The cheeses did not look similar on any of the tests which will fix the test
S a t I s f y I n g
*my new role model*       notice me senpi
this is what I want to do with my life
Give. Me. CHEESE!!!!
She's supposed to be a cheese expert? Could tell you most of this offthe top of my head.
I love her little cheese knife
how did I get here
What do you think you will be in the future     A cheese expert
The pronunciation tilts me
Couldn’t anyone tell that the old disgusting one was more expensive, it’s always the disgusting one
i wanna be a cheese expert when i grow up
Every veagans enimie haha
Right off the bat
What do cheese experts do exactly?
One of the best youtube videos to date
This woman really knows what she's talking about.
Where's the mozzarella at?
This is kinda stupid cuz I’m not a cheese expert and I could tell which is more expensive
Where do you learn this stuff... cheese school.     I swear if someone says cheese school actually exist I will literally strip myself and go outside for 5 minutes
Wow! I am proud of myself, I got these right just by looking at them and a little extra help with her saying how it tasted.
I think I found my profession, because I guessed the answer to each of these correctly.
I didnt know that porn can be on youtube
A cheesepert.
this made me eat all the cheese in my fridge
great great video you guys
clicked on this video to watch someone guess cheese prices, not tell us every fact about the cheese....just guess which is most expensive, dammit!
Cheese but to the     *EXTREME*
This must be the best job in the world! I love cheese.. She's so talented. 😍
In all cases I guessed only visually which cheese was more expensive, even though I'm not a cheese expert ... But I'm a cheese eater!
I love you Liz! I want your job!!!!! I could die by cheese consumption!
cheese meaning balls or cheese meaning dairy?
fruity flavor in cheese haha
She is sooooo cute!! I couldn't focus on the video.
How you guys pronounce GOUDA    Hahaha
so much of cheese knowledge...........
"Smell's kinda nutty" sounds legit.
I wish she'd told us where the expensive blue cheese was from.
blue cheese hAS MOLD IN IT
If it looks disgusting its more expe sive
Got a joke 'bout her cheese?
I guessed correctly on everything except the feta, and the only thing I know about cheese is that it's delicious.
The music is like the just cause 2 menu music
This is.. Very, very easy.
4am and im here thinking why all the expensive cheese is B
Man. I felt good about my life listening to a cheese expert.
That’s an Irish flag, not the Italian one
Ok Greek feta cheese is nothing like feta cheese in other countries but thats my opinion so *flies away*
Switzerland isn't part of the European Union
Top notch content!
Where can I apply for this job?
now do it blindfolded
Where is the goddamn gouda?
Cheese expert!!!
She's a cheese expert. It's not really 'guessing' is it?
can we have a podcast of this please? this is the cheeseknowledge i came her for
1:18 .... did she just thunderblast her pants?
She taught me so much. 🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️
*"so what do you do for a living?"*
Why don't they tell us the actual names of the cheeses?
she knows so much..
Too easy witch one is the Expensive one  onli on 1 look
Oh look, I could guess right just by looking at them
now THAT'S a professional !!
I’m lactose intolerant. I don’t even enjoy cheese that much, but yet I’m here immersed in this video. It’s kind of strange how no matter the subject, watching someone talk and show their expertise in a subject they enjoy is quite enjoyable, almost addicting.
This video is 11 minutes long but i enjoy every single second of it. Great video!
Is it funny that I grabbed some cheddar in our fridge since I was getting hungry?
Anyone else not like cheese (Except for pizza, pizza is good.)?
So basically, the older aged cheese is more expensive
Lol I found my career I new every one of them
Alright. I got all of them right, because the weirder it looks, the more expsensive.
You can be a cheese expert? How do I sign up?
Where can I apply? I luuuuurrrrvvveee cheese.
Am I the only one that didn't know *Cheese expert's* were a thing?..
Im not near a cheese expert and I could have tell away which one was more expensive
I have never wanted any job as much as her job more.
My only complaint is that she didn't say where to get that bleu cheese lol
I just enjoy watching people who are good at their craft.  Good times.
dude she totally farted at 1:18.
Jim Thorpe??? Ancestry?
I’m craving cheese... my next google search is how many types of milk can humans drink.
Am I the only one who thinks that it's visually obvious which ones are the more expensive ones????
How do I end up here
She's really what you want in a food expert - knowledgeable but down to earth.
Dickcheese
What I learned: The darker a cheese the more expensive it is.
Shes fat cause she eat cheese
How tf does one become a cheese expert? Like "what are you majoring in?" ..."Cheese" lmao 😂
Oh my I actually guess everyone right!!!
Am I the only one that noticed at 2:24 they used the Ireland Flag instead of the Italian Flag? Lol...
the more shittier it tastes the more it costs.
i didn’t like looking at that aged goat cheese
hot
Wow just the thought of something I love chese has to grow ew
Cheese is always the best
She cuts the cheese at 1:18. Literally and figuratively.
anyone else here love cheese so much this video made you hungry?
I wonder how much she makes
I like your cheese blades there pretty cool
So, where can *I* go to school to learn how to do what this lady does? Because her job sounds amazing lol.
Teach me your cheese ways
Teacher: where do you see yourself in 10 years? Parents: what do want to be when you grow up? Me: 0:01 pause
Kind of cheesy video for my taste :/
Of course, their white
Someone farted at 1:19
I never seem an expert with such a lack of vocabulary to describe taste, shape and color of her field of expertise
Why does goat cheese taste like soap to me?   But cilantro is delicious I don't have an issue with it at all.  I know people describe both as soap-like, but the cilantro issue is because of an actual genetic trait some people have.   Maybe not genetic, but there is a biological reason.   Is there something similar for goat cheese?  Because to me it doesn't even taste edible.
She defentely knows her cheese
"...and I'm a cheese expert." My kind of woman.
Too bad, I only have Eden cheese...
it’s not 5x more expensive cause the weights are different
Did someone fart @1:17
You too, can spend either $16 or $47 to have your food taste like feet.
this is the third time i watch this video     Not the last tho
wooow. i loved this!!?
Why is there no link listing all the cheeses and where to buy them at? I'd def buy a 1/4lb of that blue cheese
Greek Feta Cheese is bae❤
Love the cheese knife!  Yeah, a really clear difference in the appearance is a dead giveaway.  Might have to go and eat some cheese now :-P
Creamy
29 bucks/lb for a Parmigiano Reggiano? Thank god I live in Italy! Here a really good Parmigiano is around 20 €/kg, meaning 11 bucks/lb. Come visit us :D
This was a really great video. I’ve learned a ton & her passion for her career is infectious.
I searched pimple popping videos, and now I'm here
This was cheesy
Bro your breathe gotta smell like aged brown yellow-y protein crystal open aired young concentrated creamy ball sweat.
Why does she not have more videos? She is so passionate about what she does and she is very knowledgeable and doesn't come across as a snob like so many "experts" do.
This was waaaay more informative than I thought it was going to be. I love it! It makes this video so much more interesting to watch. :)
i love cheese. thanks for your awesome presentation!
So the ones that have disgusting rinds are expensive....
That's pretty cool.  Maybe not fap material but was entertaining none the less.  =D
Next time... don't show the whole piece, I could've guessed the more expensive one just by looking at it.
WHERE IS RYUKAHR?
I love her but why does she cut a huge piece and eat a tiny portion of it it really annoyies me
Chese expert xD i could tell you which is more expensive right of the bat
Wait I can make money doing this sick
What I have learnt - The more mold, the more expensive.
she is hot :)
I didn't knew there was Michael jordan cheese G.O.A.T
I got em all right just by looking at em
*White People*
Conclusion: the uglier it looks, the more expensive it is.
Two things im paying attention on  1.the cheese  2.the different knives she uses to cut each cheese
did someone on set fart at 1:18??
Did any of you actually think she'd get anything wrong?
Yeah, but they're all kinda gross mould that tastes funky and makes you fat in addition to costing a bajillion dollars, so no thanks! D:
cheese with maggots where is it
my father would love to eat your milk curd
1:18
You should smell my cheese.
I gained 5lbs just watching this
A job to eat cheese and study cheese, I totally qualify
this is one of the most interesting and unimportant videos i’ve ever watched.
did someone fart at 1:18
She looks like the rat guy from Harry potter
To my surprise, this was informative and enjoyable.
I bet her mother is proud of her
0:04 1:07 1:21 3:08 3:30 5:07 5:15 7:34 9:36 9:51  Jenna marble's OH HELLLL YEAAA  thank me later
These were the furthest from “guesses”.
Well I'll be dayumed! I learned something today! Thank you cheese expert lady!
she knows her cheeses, but she doesnt know math.
I love this. I never thiught I would enjoy this much cheese-talk😍👍
I have no money to buy any of these cheeses, so I siply watch such videos. TY.
She probably has the worst breath
the goat cheese is only 2.5 times more expensive
As a Dutch guy,  I guessed everything right.
Why would u want little crystals in it
A cheese expert that cant pronounce cheese names? Ok
Cheesy expert.
This video was cheesy.
Where were the cheap cheeses?
this is why theres a pay gap.
Xxx
Good lord I want some cheese now.  I wanna nibble on that blue cheese so bad.
it doesnt take an expert to figure out which ones are more expensive
Who likes cheese thus much
Yo, what? Its got the Irish flag. 29$ is like €33.
Why is it the Irish flag
What when did shep make some milk and why has the man put holez in a cheeze to have it mold and make blue and is mold not very dangiros
Seriously? I looked at some comments and all said that she was so knowledgeable and stuff. But i mean. You see it!! If the cheese looks older (whoch isn't hard to guess) you will know the more expensive cheese...
This is a very minute criticism, but.....although I very much appreciate her knowledge of the characteristics of good cheeses, it's not really a blind taste test - I was thinking more along the lines of seeing if an expert can determine the difference in pre-cut, pre-portioned bits of cheese.  That being said, I think she'd still be able to identify the cheap versus expensive, though, based on her expertise shown throughout the video.
Lol mention become inventors, women become cheese experts and they write books for social status. Wonder what she wrote
I always knew too.. its not that hard!
Doctor: *You have eleven minutes and twenty seconds left to live.*
How do you become a cheese expert ?
White people and their cheese. Smh
Ok, but someone definitely farted at 1:18
Cheese expert...wow...
After watching this, I have heard the word cheese so much so that is doesnt sound like a word
Her toilet must of been roasted
I like cheese but some of these are just disgusting. Cheese thats gone hard or mouldy should be thrown out not eaten 🤢😷
Italian flag is with red not orange
she kinda looks like the mom from modern family
I'm a bit confused as to why the EU would be subsidizing Swiss cheese making when Switzerland is not part of the EU.
Really? No "Who cut the cheese" jokes in the comments? Am I the only immature one here?
Taste test     Sniffs cheese
it's so obvious the old one is the most expensive cheese da!!!!
ew
Whoa your cheese knife is awesome
Welp I can't have expensive cheese because I'm flipping allergic to mold
"Cheese Expert" - then proceeds to call it "Goo-da"  .........
this really just made me crave cheese, like insanely bad
Why did I watch this... Now I really want cheese. but I live in college dorms, there's snow and ice on the roads, I have no cheese, and there's no place to get any on campus. I live a sad life.
I love the cheese knife she has.
you confused the italian flag with the irish one... come on.
so thts what my great grandnma was eating at breakfast
It would be funny if she was lactose intolerant
Wow, no need to be a cheese expert to guess which one is the expensive one.
I don't claim to be an expert by any means but I love cheese and I only got one wrong, and I didn't even get to taste it, so I'm really proud of myself 😊😊
she's legit
Girl... I could have told you without even tasting or smelling them 😂Don't misunderstand me, your knowledge is admirable and you've said many facts I didn't know. But for the looks it's easy to tell which one is the expensive. It may have something to do with being meditarranean maybe? But for us it's really easy to tell when a cheese is going to be cheap or expensive, they just look totally different.
This shows that you don't need basic elementary school mathematics to become a cheese expert...
LOL
Cheese expert, deosn't know how to cut parmigiano
I’m going to bed early tonight *3 in the morning*
cheese
No clue why tf this was in my feed, but was impressed nonetheless.
easy the one that looks rotting is more expensive
That expensive Blue Cheese is from my town in Oregon. It's Rogue Creamery's Rogue Blue in Central Point.
Imagine being so white you're a cheese expert?
She’s so cool!
Her breath must smell SO bad
The younger the cheaper.
This is basic knowledge here in Italy
But seriously, if you're just a little bit educated you could have known this too. It was way too obvious
Cheap doesn't mean worst with out knowing the price and knowing the price it changes the way someone finds the taste
I got all of these I think I found my new career
*Appreciating that Italian pronunciation*
Imagine how her armpits smell
U could say this is a very..Cheesy video
4$ / 4oz = 6$ / 6oz. 20$ / 6$ = 3.33 x more expensive, not 5.  I love these kinds of videos especially for certain products such as wine and other products which tend to have a very snobby and trendy following. They often show how prices mean sweet f***all and even so-called experts often prefer the more affordable version when tasting/testing blind, instead of the artificially hyped up pricey items.
be good if you could identify flags as the first 3 minutes of the video, the parmesan cheese..... they are using a republic of Ireland flag on the card not Italian
why am i doing this?
I'm not even italian, but I notice how she butchers the  pronounciation of the parmeggiano reggiano...no hate at all, but she might want to talk to someone from italy.
if the cheese is italian why is there an irish flag next to it? unless its the filter
I literally could've told you the A parmigiano was more expensive just by looks
I think she should try my very own Fromunda cheese.....         Fromunda my foreskin ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
4:00 it wasn’t 5 times more expensive it was 2.3 times more expensive
$4/4oz and $20/6oz = 5 times more expensive :D
the way she says PARMEJANO REJIANO.... god damn.... rip italian language. I know she is american but she could have shown some class...
It's Butters' mom
Rogue River Blue
This is my favorite comment section on youtube. I love how theres no hate. Hooray for cheese and boredom
show us your cheese
This made me want cheese
Madison hills mom?
How do I go about being a cheese expert...?
Jesus H. Christ she's a cheese expert
I love how she even finds uses for the cheaper cheeses and doesn't act like a snob about expensive cheeses
i love cheese
2:24 apparently the expensive cheese is from Ireland
I LOVE CHEESE🧀🧀
Damn, she really knows her stuff!
Do del taco shredded cheese vs Taco Bell shredded cheese
I’m not even a cheese expert and I got all them right, she sucks!
I love cheese. This may be my calling
she feels really proud of eat cheese haha
I kinda want to eat cheese now.
She's a...Cheese Whiz.  That said, I guess I am too as I picked them all correct on sight alone.
No dutch cheeses, it hurts :'(
Best job ever.
ITS 2 AM and i see a rectangular swiss flag i cant sleep anymore
hello brucella
I wonder americans can make real cheese ^^
So where do I go to become a cheese expert?
I have no idea how I got to this video but wow that's awesome and love that she's sooo passionate about it
damn. I didnt know it was possible to make a living being a cheese expert. I want to do that
parmijiano rejiano
This is sad
White people don't have any cul--
Why am I watching this at 2am when I have to wake up in 4 hours!?
So basically im an expert in cheese too i guessed them all before she even said a word about it.
She has a really good video persona . Love her
"Parmigiano Rejoano"???? 00:46 as an Italian speaker I feel ofended.
I love this!
She's very knowledgeable, makes educated guess, and admits when she's not sure about something (as opposed to guessing blindly and pretending that you know the answer as amateurs do). As a result, her answers are dead-on. Truly an expert.
To be fair, you don't have to be a cheese expert to tell the difference between the cheeses in this video. You can really tell on first glance, just by how they look.
I want her Job
This is where you end up at 4 in the morning and you just say one more video.
This wasn't even hard, I got 100%
I'm into what she does, but I cant help but wonder how they manage to not have breathe stink.
I just watch a woman eat cheese for 11 mins. What has my life become
So basically, the darker cheese is more expensive?
*oh look the cheese expert was right about cheese*
She really looks like the nude model from my Tortora and other anatomy books. Gad
its 1:35 in the morning. why am i watching this instead of doing latin
I have no clue why but this video played after a totally unrelated video I was watching while I was preoccupied. It was one of the most entertaining things I've seen in awhile for some reason. I could've watched her talk about cheese all night long. She's got a great presence on camera and you can tell she's passionate about it because she so casually talks about everything with confidence so you just want to sit back and listen. Great smile too.
“Smells kinda nutty”         Takes a B I T E
This chick must blast the nastiest farts.
tbh ill just put some crayons in my salad instead of that cheese.
What if she try MAGGOT CHEESE.
Since taste is personnal, the best cheese is the one you prefer. If you want to understand the true french lifestyle you'll have to stop being in America with those "experts" that can just tell you how people will see you eating cheese. In France we doesn't look at our wallet to buy cheese, we look at the amount of people at our table. *Flies away on a baguette*
This is the most interesting thing I’ve ever seen 😂 and I’m really surprised
I’m watching this because I freaking love cheese
I was gonna laugh when she said splurging on cheese, but then I remembered that I would do that.
at first, I thought this was buzzfeed
Guys it's the cheese goddess. She is the ultimate boss no one will be able to surpass. Don't even think of trying and give up already she will obliterate you. I'm giving you a warning children please take the warning seriously. Wait.... she is *cheesus* **^**
I love that I actually learned a lot about cheese in a short amount of time from a person whom I found very charmingly without arrogance or pretension.  Thank you!
I guessed all of them right, am I a cheese expert now?
Huh...I would date this woman
If you're going to be a cheese expert, at least learn how to pronounce the names right from different languages
Damn she good, didn't even miss one
This is like the 11th time I replayed this video
She can taste some of my cheese.
They used the Republican of Ireland flag instead of the Italian flag on the first one.... Wat..  Also Switzerland isn't in the EU.
I feel like all food/drink experts as handicapped by small amount of adjectives to describe the taste. Always the same description although completely different products; rich, melts in mouth, beautiful aroma, beautiful texture etc.
I guessed all of them right, just by looking at them except for the feta cheese
I'm getting a strong craving for parmesan, but it's 4 in the morning and I'm too comfterble
I just cut the cheese
1:12 *"like biting into a crayon"* like how in the hell you know what crayon taste like?
So from the beginning of milk and cheese, Europe does it better?  hau  ba tat.
Da Vinci Gouda
I´m vegan yet I´m still entertained by this
Oh she likes black olives? What other black things does she like? Asking for a friend
I could guess these by just looking at them it’s really not that hard
The more rotten the cheese The most expensive it is..
Hubba-Hubba, Liz. You and I should get together and...  make our own soft cheeze.  DEFinitely a collaborative effort
and they say the perfect career doesn't exist...
NEVER argue with a woman like this, either she is right or you're wrong. I mean i can't tell the difference in cheese while they're still in the supermarket shelf
Only problem is even an uneducated person can guess these. It would have been tougher (and as a result more interesting) if they'd gotten a few a little less obvious. Sure I couldn't tell you these specifics about each cheese like she could, but guessing which was the cheaper one based on visuals alone was a cinch with even slight knowledge of what makes cheese more expensive.
I’m Greek so I eat feta all the time!
It upsets me that she's a "cheese expert" but can't pronounce cheese names properly.
Hm, not a cheese expert but I got every single one right.
easy..... i know nothing and I could tell just by looking at them
Hmmm....Im a cheese expert too.Whatta guy  :)
yes i really like parmigiano - reggiano... its my favorite cheese
Now can water experts explain why there's water bottles over $100 to $400
What a cheesy episode.
Finally an expert that we can enjoy listening too.
would have been more interesting if you presented her two pre-sliced pieces so she can't judge off anything but taste
How does one become a cheese expert and can this wonderful lady adopt me please so she can teach me her ways
"Parmezian"
I wonder what she thinks of vegans
i would love to eat and explore cheese as a living. dream job. my weight gain every christmas is down to cheese alone haha.
How do I become a cheese expert?  Also: I wonder how regular her poops are? I eat a lot of cheese and it’s not so good for me.
1:18 If you listen closely you'll hear a fart.
Wtf am i doing
As a European I can assure you, nobody in the USA even knows what cheese is - that plastic garbage you eat isnt fit for animal feed
I usually despise food experts but for some reason I like this woman. She taught me a lot about cheese and she just seems very down to earth. Good job Liz.
I would do “almost” anything for a piece of Feta right now.
For anyone curious about the leaf-wrapped cheese, it's the Rogue River Blue. It is, by far, one of the most incredible cheeses I've ever tried. Where many blue cheeses have the mold flavour overpowering everything else, Rogue River Blue's cheese has a tangy, creamy, fruity flavour that is just as strong as the mold.  I'm betting the other of the two leaf-wrapped blue cheeses she was thinking about was the Spanish cheese, Valdeon, which is also another great blue cheese and a bit more affordable.
Switzerland is not the part of the EU
Cheese is very bad for you, it's also very bad for the planet, plus the cows get their calves taken away and slaughtered for veal meat... It's addictive due to casomorphin which is responsible for babies going back to their mother's breasts until they're weaned.
pro tip: the uglier the cheese, the more expensive
Of course it’s a old looking blonde person that’s a cheese expert
holly shmoolly she's really a cheese expert
"...and i'm a cheese expert."
Why are they comparing Irish prices to American prices?
i love cheese , there are so many of them so everybody will find a favourite :-)
smells kinda nutty
I don't even like this cheese, but this woman talking about cheese gives me a semi.
Mom. When I grow up, I want to be a cheese expert.
Dang. I learned things here.
I appreciate this video a lot because americans have a really terrible concept of cheese, so the more awareness there is about this beautiful food, the better!
ye the more aged cheeses are more expensive lol
Why would you pay more for Crusty old cheese
I can tell which are more expensive just by looking at them.
At one point, her smile looks like "YAS LEMME EAT THE CHEESE" when she says she needs to taste them. And the happiness she exudes when she reveals the prices. HAHA! It's so obvious how much she loves her job. I love her.
Liz Thorpe is hot.
That moment when you realise you just wasted 10 mins of your life watching someone guess cheese
She really spoke truth tbh at 6:32 it's important to think about how you use your money and what that supports in the world on a deeper level...
I got them all right.. I just took the ones that looked older
Proof that a good teacher can make any subject interesting.
This channel feels like one of the many hydra heads of buzzfeed and I'm not sure I should be watching it if that's the case.
Is it just me or does she look like drew barrymore
Take a shot everytime she say cheese
i know nothing about cheese, but knew the answer to these by looking at the samples. why not a blind taste test for her?
1:18 I guess you can say, someone cut the cheese ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I wish they'd add a really nice vegan cheese to compare with non-vegan cheeses. It would make for a very interesting comparison!
All cheese smell like farts.
blue cheese made with mold? dafuq
Hey I guessed most of these before the reveal. Guess I should consider a career in tasting expertise.
So food is better if you let it age for a few weeks. Just like in Kitchen Nightmares with Gordon Ramsay         Oh wait....
I thought she was Miranda from Sex and the City :O
This was great! I was a little hesitant to watch because cheese can be pretentious, but she was so approachable and passionate!
This was actually very informative and useful.
I’m lactose intolerant...why did I watch this.
i watched the whole  thing  ...why?
All I can think of is 30rock  "working on my night cheese."
It would be a better test to do it blindfolded because she predisposes herself to the one that looks that it might be pricey just by the aesthetics of them. Various times she says ¨it is more labour intensive¨ but that´s not quite right, there are other reasons but not about how much work is needed, my family produced cheese for a good amount of years and while it consumes some time it is nothing out of the extraordinaire except for the waiting in the aged cheeses, and one of the main reasons of the price in some of them is because of the amount of milk needed, aged cheeses dehydrate so you need quite more cheese to produce a kilo of aged cheese than to produce a kilo of queso fresco or panela (I think in the US there are a lot of cheeses they do not know that are produced in México), or to produce a kilo of cotija. The ones that are made with milk from cows fed exclusively with grass are pricey because there is a sector of population that is willing to pay more because they find the taste better even if it is not, they might find nuts and almond flavours if they know it is comes from a grass fed cow... which is why a blindtest would reveal quite a lot more.
I want her job
I can taste the cheese just watching this~
Thanks YouTube,now i am an expert in cheese
I don’t understand how people become cheese experts
I'm tired of her womansplaining
She’s like a cheese detective 😍
Why did I guess them right before it was revealed or talked about by looking, I'm a nub when it comes to cheese, I just know what I personally like. Confused :x
Can’t. Stop. Watching. This. White. Lady. Talk. About. CHEESE.
When you're lactose intolerant and cheese is one of your favourite things
"This is made with a different kind of milk."  Ya, I'm guessing it is milk from at least a different part of the globe, so guessing they were penalty fed differently.  You could have said that with every pair up there.  It gets creepy when the person starts fishing for random things to say.
This woman has my dream job. Great video. She has a knowledge and passion for what she does. Always great to see.
I get the feeling she knew what shes having before it was pulled out infront of her by herself with the labels printed by her.
There is laws about cheese in greece?
I wanna be a cheese expert now
"I'm gonna have to taste it" translates to "I didn't have lunch"
"probably about the same age, probably 10 months"
So much scripted....😕
Im lactose..
She need to be my wife
this made me crave cheese
At 2:24 that's not the italian flag. That is ireland lmao
Cheese expert....now there's a useful occupation!
how she pronunce "parmigiano reggiano" made me laugh all the time
Blessed are the cheese makers.
Why am i watching this without eating breakfast and lunch, and it's almost dinner here..... i want to taste those so bad..
That's not 5 times more expensive...
When you're lactose intolerant and you watch other people eat cheese for you
i guessed which one was more expensive just by looking at it. Didn't miss a beat.
Duh!
What about cheddar?
Don't let her see the cheese
Hey I guess I'm a cheese expert too!
I can only imagine her pickup lines
I don't want to brag but, I'm a cheese expert so I'm kind of a big deal.
Very informative!
can someone explain why anyone would eat molded cheese?
Everyone is a cheese expert, if it looks old, then you can't afford it. If its ugly and hard, then you can't afford it. Ill stuck to my prepackaged Asiago from walmart lol
I’m not a cheese expert and I can guess which one is more expensive on almost all of them
Why am I watching this I’m lactose intolerant
*facepalm*
Should have been a blind taste test.
I guess she didnt forget the criteria...
The first 3 cheeses was not even hard to guess only by looking at them
I like her bring her on again
Dont tell me u didnt hear the fart at 1:18 xD
Did anyone else think that the title said Chinese expert
She kinda looks like Kate McKinnon
I think it defeats the purpose of saying parmesan right in a sense that you say it parmejan of you twl it in a thick american accent anyway. In germany they just use the  s. parmezan
...It's just cheese. Wait, does that men I can be a candy expert? I get to taste candy and shiz.
I dont understand the nut thing. I never taste nuts or fruits, but everyone else does.
Best job ever
It's sounds weird to me to describe a cheese with a brie look.  For those curious, brie is the name of 2 cheeses in France, both made not far from Paris, Brie de Melun and Brie de Meaux, the names mean, Brie from the town of Melun and Brie from the town of Meaux.  Neither of them look anything like the goat's cheese, probably because brie is made with cow's milk.  If you ever want to buy a French Brie, you have to make sure it's called Brie de Meaux or Brie de Melun since they have an AOC, which means to have those names they have to be made in a very specific region, with a very specific milk, in a very specific way.  Wow you made it this far, congrats!
Why was this in my suggested?
What am I doing with my life it's 5am and I'm watching a lady eat some cheese tf I'm going to try it my self 😴
This test was a joke.
I was able to guess all of these because I'm so familiar with cheap cheeses
I got all of them right except the feta cheese.
Am i the only one who thinks she looks kinda like julie bowen???
"I think I need to taste them." Means in cheese terms, "What? I want cheese and it's right here and I like cheese so Imma eat the cheese."
Why am I highly entertained by this video???? I could watch her go on about cheese for hours and I would still want more.
Supreme patty eyes
who can defeat her ???? shes the cheese wizrd ??????????
Well usually the more aged cheese is the more expensive
I like how she explains the price differences. Most of the time it comes down to how much work was put into it instead of "because it tastes better".
Its cheese... Why would you need to be a expert.
i was so nervous she was going to get one wrong but she aced it, like a boss.
Why am i watching this.
Wow, I wish I liked cheese
will this be the first Cheep vs Expensive Expert style video were there is actually someone knowledgeable talking?
you can tell the difference by the look
Litterally the easiest cheeses ever.. I could guess all of these. If a cheese “expert” missed any of these I’m afraid there entire existence would be in vain.
This really made my day!
according to the flags on price labels, that parmigiano-reggiano is from Ireland
For the second cheese comparison it’s not 5 times as expensive, because it’s 4 oz compared to 6 oz. So the less expensive cheese is $1 an ounce, and the more expensive cheese is $3.3 an oz. So not a really that crazy of a price difference.
I almost threw up when I saw the second sample set with all that bacteria shyte on it. Disgusting
Honestly you don't even have to be a cheese expert  to see which ones are more expensive.
Is it a bad sign when a random woman eating old cheese is more interesting than studying Math???
Why is there an Ireland flag on the first one
did anyone notice her weird knife
How does one become a cheese expert...? Asking for a friend.
I don’t even like cheese. Nevertheless I somehow ended up here.
Im lactose intolerant, i have to learn what am i doing here
Lactose intolerant and hating life rn...
FUKIN KG PLEASE
I can tell which cheese is more expensive by looking at it.
Huh, I don't eat all these different types of cheese and know nothing about them, but I could and did easily guess the most expensive from the look. If you REALLY want to do a REAL test with an expert, then take away that visual, at least cut equal cubes of the cheese...
damn this lady is so good at her job u go girl
came for the clickbaity title, stayed for the e d u c a t i o n ✨✨✨
She probably smells like feet
She is a beast until you realize is a fake test.
Almost none of the cheese that they showed here was cheap. $3.30 per 100g is not cheap. Cheese in general is expensive, but especially if you go for many of the styles which have to be produced in a specific more costly process.  I'm not saying that the video is bad, but it should be called less expensive vs more expensive cheeses.
Old cheese, smelly cheese, "complex" taste cheese = expensive.
I hate cheese why am I here
Very informative! This girl knows her stuff. Wish shed talked more about the leaf thing and who made it etc
I think pretty much everyone could guess which one is more expensive.
It doesn’t take an expert to do this cheese test come on
Pile cheese is 1,00 euro or 600 USD
How doesn't cheese get everyone sick its aged milk lol
I bet she throws awesome dinner parties
NO CHEDDAR?!
She looks like cheese
I like the fact she still appreciates even the cheap cheeses
Her eyes are purple
Absolutely loved this segment!
Now, do blind folded
I don’t care about cheese. Why am I watching someone eat cheese.   And why am I entertained?
*mom walks in Whatcha watching? Me: a cheese expert taste cheese
this is better than any buzzfeed food testing video. i actually learned something here.
Me just looking at them for 2 seconds without tasting or smelling them had me know the answer... It would have at least been better blindfolded. And I don't want to throw shade or anything because she does know her stuff, I just don't think it was in any way a challenge.
I legit wanted to find out how one becomes a cheese master but I’m also lactose intolerant so... nevermind
*smells the cheese*Her: I can tell the farmer who made this farted twice then did a backflip 7 weeks ago
Cheese does not smell good even if you like it
You should eat my cheese. 😣
I really enjoyed this video. I’d definitely watch more from her and more about different cheeses.
She said she is a cheese expert so proudly
She may very well be an excellent Cheese Expert, but I am a Cheez Whiz!
imagine having to tell people you're a cheese expert
God, learn those words, pronounce correctly if that's your expertise... not rejeeeano it's reggiano (reh -djaano ) also parmigiano and gruyére is not pronounced liked that
wow this is extremely unimpressive
Should have given a a piece of cheese from the same company but different sizes so prices are different  just to confuse her
omg she really is cheese god
Mind: You really have to do your homework and learn for exams! Me: watches this video
She was awesome!
it sucks being lactose intolerant 💔 I still consume dairy tho 😂😂
it sucks being lactose intolerant 💔 still eat cheese produ
She is the first "Master" that I have seen on YouTube at least that not only knows her stuff but still has a appreciation for the other cheeses and helpful info. Really dig it .
I mean I can tell which is more expensive just by looking at it  Older=Expensive right?
Why do you have an Irish flag for the Italian cheese
ngl anyone could guess which cheese is more expensive XD
how about making durian expert guessing which durians is more expensive?
👌
I click because of cheese... I don't even like cheese yet I watch this... Fascinating...
I was thoroughly entertained by her eating cheese
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"  *becomes "cheese expert"*  "You are a disgrace"
Her knowledges about cheese are so admireable!
goat cheese = 420
She really knows her cheese. Damn. She’s all like “That is definately made with grass fed cow’s milk as the color is darker which will make it more expensive” meanwhile I am like “This one tastes better...”
So basically, the uglier the cheese, the more expensive it is.
this is my favorite video in the world
My dream job      Who is she kidding, she knows exactly which cheese is the most expensive the second she looks at it
I want to see this done with wine. I bet they won’t have the same score as this cheese professional
Should have blindfolded for tasting
This woman is someone i should look up to, but not with just cheese, with all foods😂😂
Anyone hear the fart sound like at 1:18 ?
What a weird and amazing job, i think maybe a chef or a farmer that would like to get some kind of recognition would hire her for that? Besides of that i cant think of anything else but i do know if something is gourmet involved is expensive, idk how much money shes getting for that but sure is a fair amount
I'm Liz Thorpe and I disappoint my parents
i feel like she knew the answers before
*My parents* : What do you want to be when you grow up? *Me* :
How does she earn a living again?👀
"Like biting into a crayon"   Wut? 😂
Smile for the camera CHEESE 🧀
Damn I love blue cheese
Hi! I’m Alisha blis and I’m your freestyle dance teacher
man expensive cheese isnt dat tasty lmao often its rlly dry
Food experts = I'm good at nothing so let me eat
I freaking love cheese
this would be my daughter's dream job!! lol
This makes me so hungry for cheese
I once ate cheese with the white crystals, they were annoying as hell.
White Stilton with Blueberries. So good.
I lived in the cheese, i smell like cheese, I have been molded by it. And I really mean mold. Its disgusting.
1:17, did she fart?
I could be a cheese expert apparently lol
Americans should really learn how to pronounce foreign stuff.
I hate how she cuts the cheese.... no offense but great review!
I'm just a normal bloke and I got only one wrong. The feta one. Guess I'll become a cheese expert.
👌👌👌
You know you've accomplished soomething in lief when you call yourself a cheese expert
Just me or every cheese taste the same 😵
Who cuts cheese like that? wtf
1:18 was that a fart
How did I get here... I'm allergic to cheese
it's 3 am wtf
Some people are attractive for reasons outside of physical characteristics. This woman displaying her cheese knowledge is doing it for me.
I don't even like cheese and I found this video super interesting and enjoyable.
I absolutely adore cheese.  Looking at the comments I guess I'm a cheese snob. I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I knew like 60% of the stuff she said just because I can't stand cheese rind or blue cheese so I've done a bunch of research into cheese to know what to stay away from. And then I choose better (typically more expensive) cheeses based off of what I would like.
I love that this series doesn't seem to want to "call out" supposed experts and lets their experience do the talking. There's no "got you" attempts at the experts expense. Very informative, thanks!
Guess I'm an expert, I guessed them all correct just by looks
Cheese Connoisseur  ;D
I’m no expert but you could tell by the appearances which would cost more
Really wish they listed the names of the brands/makers of all the cheeses
I'm a cheese expert. Everytime you see molds that's expensive
When you’re lactose intolerant but eat cheese religiously
How does she get paid...?
$15 FOR CHEESE!!!!!!???????!!!!
Liz, teach me your ways. I must know how to be the cheese master.
she bleu my mind
Wow now I want high level type of cheese now with my friends that I don't have ,p
Wow now I want high level type of cheese now with my friends that I don't have ,p
Wow now I want high level type of cheese now with my friends that I don't have ,
This is my dream job
Basically longer aged more expensive
She got them all right. Illumicheesei confirmed.
This was too easy obviously the aged cheese is more expensive
This is more like an intro to cheeses, but cool video idea
Imagine going to college for this
Wait Parmigiano-Reggiano Can only be made in Parma... Reggio Emilia... Bologna, Modena and Mantua, Italy................ The Tag of the cheese has an Ireland flag.....  2:24 .... That's an Irish flag sweet heart not an Italy flag.
I thought this was BuzzFeed
I expected her to be super pretentious but she was solely informative! Cheese queen!
why i'm here, i can't eat cheeze but i watched the whole video...
One day I hope to know as much about something as she knows about cheese.
Cheese is trash... idk why this was even in my recommendations but it sure was interesting to watch a cheese expert at work haha.
I thought parmeggiano reggiano was made with sheep's milk...
Any expert should know that the Italian word parmigiano is translated to English as Parmesan. Trying to make up a word “parmejaaan” is ridiculous. Pick one or the other... then if you are presenting in English USE THE ENGLISH NAME!!!  An expert should be fastidious about correcting such blasphemy - not perpetuate it.
The cheese expert is white? LOL!
Whichever one tastes the worse is more expensive
Any other greek people just watch dat video and jus be proud of their feta cheese?:(
was she from my state of wisconsin
Is that last one Rogue River Blue?
I think the hard part here was that the contender (cheaper cheese) was still of a high quality and thus quite expensive.
Who's hungry for cheese now?
I love her passion and dedication, but then I remember it's about cheese. Imagine what an interesting person she would be if she applied herself to something that actually matters. She's obviously very smart and competent.
I don't even like cheese, what am I doing here
Can i make mouse tiddy milk and sell it for a huge amount cuz mice have little tiddys??
She's ultimate gay🍆
Anyone else notice the Irish flag instead of Italian flag at the beginning?
Wow they really used an Irish flag thinking it was an Italian one
she may has used both cheap and expensive cheeses. that why she has so much knowledges.
Why B is always expensive than A
I was very impressed by how much she knew!
What a honey!
Why did I decide to watch someone eat cheese
Find the pointy penis hint:its apart of her shirt
If my life doesn’t work out I’ll become a cheese expert
What am I doing here, I’m lactose intolerant
Okay but I love Cheese lady thank you so much
Why are they comparing costs over differrent weights?
When u're a cheese lover it's not very difficult to know what cheese is cheap and what is expensive.
420
CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESEE PLEEEEEEEEEEEAAASE (btw this was extremely boring)
Goo-da Goo-da
Oh come on that was easy XD
I love her!
one day , I'll be a cheese experts.
Have you ever been in love with cheese ?
I just watched a 11 min video on cheese lol, and I am lactose intolerant
um ok wow tho
Is this not buzzfeed
Cheese that looks way older and disgusting is more expensive NO WAY!!!!!
I don't know why I'm watching this, I'm vegan...
Anyone else disturbed by her pronunciation of 'Parmesan' ?  sounds like shes saying "Par-ma-Jean" as in Jean Claude Van Damme
Damn! Cheese an expert  Yeah..
I mean any person could have guessed most of them by price. Should have been blind folded
where were the blue cheeses from?
1:27 Youre welcome guys
She is really good at explaining her thoughts! Also, she reminds me of Julie Bowen a lot. Great video!
...now...im not a cheese person and I know very little about cheese, but the only one I got wrong was feta. Not that hard
WHERE IS THE OO IN GUDA? PRONOUNCE PLEASE LIKE GOWDA.
Wwhen you are rich and have too much time
you do NOT need a cheese expert to tell wich one is more expensive, its kind of obvious
an aged  G O O D A H
Damn gurl. I'm cheering you on. Your knowledge and passion is beyond impressive. This was awesome.
just from looking i couldtell most of them and i'm not even close to a cheese expert
She shouldve had paneer!
A cheese expert should be able to say the names properly
How can anyone govern a nation that has two hundred and forty-six different kinds of cheese? Charles de Gaulle
it was kind of obvious at first glance which ones were more expensive. except for maybe the feta
i really want some cheese now
4:00 I see what you did there buzzfeed
4:00 ...( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I guessed all of them right.. they should've done dime sized cheese
She has my dream job! Rogue Valley Creamery in Central Point, Oregon once a year makes a grape leaf wrapped blue cheese. Haven't had it yet but their Crater Lake Blue made me like blue cheese (the quality ones). And in Bandon, Oregon we have some award winning cheddars from Face Rock Creamery.  I admit I am a cheese-a-holic.
You are a cheese connoisseur
Cheese people 4:25
Me:Blue cheese Triggered person:blue cheese has mold in it  Friend:Blllluuuueeeee cccchhhheeeesssseee Triggered person:BLUE CHEESE HAS MOLD IN IT Random person:Ranch Triggered person:ranch is goood
I really don't think you need to be an expert to do this
There me: oh it’s just cheese   Cheese expert: * slaps* it’s more then just the cheese!!!!   Me:wtf
This is fixed, she knows the answers because she's part of the show
I’m lactose intolerant 🙁
I want to be a cheese, beer, and cake expert. Lol!
I want her to try different kinds of Cheese itz
when she said the cheese will GROW A RIND, i just about left  the video
Just guess B
2:24 looks like an irish flag to me...
*I THINK I HAVE TO TASTE THEM*
"It's super salty. All I taste is salt and crumbs." Then she ends up saying you should choose it because it's special. Why? She clearly preferred the cheaper cheese. All the other times, the more expensive cheese had a preferable flavor.
Who is  eating cheese right now
Great video, please do more like this one!
As soon as you see/hear the word "expert" used in news/media, question what you are seeing/hearing.
interesting that a cheese expert calls it Gooda vs Howda
Why am I watching this I’m vegan
parmeshiano reshiano
Jeeezzz or should I say cheeeese?
“What do you do for a living?”  “Oh I’m an expert in Cheese.”  “What do you do in it?”  “I eat cheese and say if it’s expensive or not.”
1:17 did she just cut the cheese while she cut the cheese?
I wish she was blindfolded, but good vid. although I could tell because of how they looked and I am the opposite of a cheese expert
Bruh... I'm must be a cheese person 2 cause I guessed all the tight ones as well 💁🏻
I don’t even like cheese why am I here
honestly if it looks more spoiled, it's more expensive
I'm severely lactose intolerant... why did I just watch this?
I'm doing the wrong thing with my life
1:07 *sniff* replace the cheese with cocaine 😂  Sorry... 😐
The thing is that she's such an expert that this video isn't cheesy at all
White people have no culture? Try again, sweaty
I was hoping for some really cheesey jokes... ...but I guess it's no joke when you're an expert.
I bet someone has a fetish for this
I love Skylar from Breaking Bad
Guessed all of these by sight alone. Easy cheesy!
If you can see it , it not a test
This is so Cheesy...
they mixed up the flags from Italy and Irland.... 2:25
wow, impressive cheese facts going down here. she knows what she's talking about!
I'm no expert and even I could tell those apart. Must have been easy for her
6:04 when u feel like a genius but realized people are watching
What do cows most like to read?  Cattle-logs       Sorry I guess that was a cheesy joke
3:19 that's what she said ?
Some people are brain surgeons Some people are pliots Some people are cashier's But not many people are......... Cheese experts
omg salute to her expertise
Gorgeos expert..
the more older it is the more expensive it is hahahahahaha jk
No cheese slices, that’s a little disappointing. But she definitely earns her title.
i personally hate cheese, why am i even watching this?? XDD
I wanted her to be wrong *so bad.*
What a great profession
Not your mom, not your milk. 🍼🐮🌱
She probably is an expert but I could've discern myself
Watching this while eating 1$ cheese
02:25 That's the Irish flag not the Italian.
So you're a cheese expert...you get paid for identifying cheese and eating them
I'm confused how a cheese smells fruity...
feta cheese comes out me: tofu
I don't really eat cheese...and cheese is not so common in my culture... But that is amazing what i just saw..
I wouldn’t eat these cheeses for a million dollar
I didn't have to taste it to know which was the most expensive one.
fart at 1:17
Oooh can I have her career?!
Ok she may be a cheese pro but she definetly didnt do her math homework. How are $4/4oz 5 times less expensive than $20/6oz? Like im not really good in maths but even i notice that the prportions are different. Correct me if im wrong.
im allergic to dairy. i have no idea why i watched this.
Old=expensive
Its so easy to get right which one is expensive if u have common sense
when i see my cheese has mold on it i toss it in the trash
Now I'm hungry
Why are so many flags wrong? The Italian flag is the Irish flag and he Swiss flag is orange..
honestly how can i have this kinda job
Not much guesswork here. So I will guess..........this video is a fraud. It isn't as if she had a hard job with no blindfold.
if its on the brink of mold and sickness        YoU CaN StILl EaT It
Woah my goodness...This lady is a superhero!
“I do know my stuff” I love that part.
Actually Fetta Cheese is made in Bulgaria and it's a Bulgarian type of cheese.
4:04 why would you not keep the ratio the same? the weights are different, i could play with the weight and make the cheaper one more expensive too. it wouldn't make a difference here, but seriously?
0:44 aged guda lmao Cheese expert and cant even pronounce the names of cheese correctly.
I don't know why anyone would waste money on mouldy cheese... It probably tastes horrible.
This could have been better...the fact that she could see the cheese first gave so much away immediately. By the time she finished talking about her observations and guessed we already knew the answer.
Im a cheese expert. I put cheese on everything
interesting, helpful and informative. thank you.
this is actually very informative
Never seen before in my life someone that’s so experienced in her field.
Any one could of done this unless you don't know anything about  chesse They should of done the blind fold taste test
go vegan! :D
Blindfolded would be more impressive cause this wasn’t hard by looking at it even for me lol
Cheese expert, more like fitness trainer.
She looks like my teacher
Mom: Honey, what do you want to be when you grow up? Daughter: *A cHEeSE ExPErT*
She's hot
Here come all the cheese experts saying they know more than her 🙄🙄🙄
Should have been a blind taste test
I learned a lot about cheese.
This is what I end up watching at 4am wooo
Am I the only one that noticed that she said 5x more expensive when one was $4 per —4oz— and the other was $20 per —6oz— meaning it was really 3.33x more expensive
She's more like a cheese scientist.
yeah this helped me decide which cheese id get at my local supermarket. haha just kidding im lactose intolerant
She could be a teacher.  The way she expresses everything and how she speaks
Not my proudest fap but it got the job done.  The cheese expert was cool I guess...
Holyshit blue cheese
This was a pretty cheesy video
Cheese is sooo good. I love fresh provolone or pepper jack cheese
You don’t need to be an expert to guess all 4 of them by looking at it. (Only the feta is difficult)
She is anhonest critic and not bias
BUT WHO THE HELL MADE THE LEAF WRAPPED CHEESE
its just the one that looks older...
"cheese expert? pfft. what can she do that-".......... " *O H WOW* "
lol thought this was the onion parody vid
In my country there's only 1 type of cheese for the majority of people and it's called cheese.
That last blue cheese is probably Valdeon made in Spain.
This is so easy, I hate cheese and I could do it by sight alone
She’s giving me Miranda vibes from Sex and the City ..anyone else??
It is very ez to see which is cheap !!
There is no cheese expert
Cheese experts turns me on
cheese expert comparing types of cheese she already know and can classify, guessing their price on which one is expensive? the heck are you trying to prove here.
The uglyer the cheese the more expensive and the nicer the cheese the more cheaper it is
Buying American Cheese is like buying Rwandan Sushi.
why do I feel positive she likes black men?
Dude me and that lady have the same last name except mine doesn’t have the e on the end 😂😂
American cheese > all
They say you look like what you eat.
Am I an expert now because I guessed them all right?
The grosser it looks, the more expensive it is.
How to get rich quick 1. Get enough money to buy a block of cheese 2. Buy block of cheese 3. Go to your nearest park 4. Wrap cheese in leaves 5. Sit outside a store and sell the leaf wrapped cheese
Where do I get a degree in cheese? I love cheese I think I can ace it... one can only hope
imagine one day she finds out she’s lactose and tolerant and allergic to dairy
I'd be a cheese expert too if I got free cheese
I feel like I should be taking notes
No one has to be an expert to know which one is more expensive by their look, blindfolded that's another story
Accidentally read chinese expert instead cheese expert. Oops.
I can’t stop watching lol
Cheese really is disgusting when you realize it's just old, moldy milk. Like for real, if anything else we eat had been out and "aging" for 18 months we wouldn't even touch it with a fork.
Impressive.
What makes someone a “cheese expert”? Is it knowing descriptive terms?
So if she got one of these wrong would she lose her title as Cheese Expert
The title should be expensive vs. more expensive
I guessed them all right within 3 seconds of seeing them. Maybe i can be a cheese expert?🤔🤔🤔🤔
Lesson: IF IT HAS AN UGLY RIND AND YOU KNOW IT IS OLD, (and taste strange)  IT IS FREAKING EXPENSIVE! Thank you for your time.
I really like this lady. She seems cool and she's entertaining. She should have her own show.
Glad to know Kraft singles are made from grass fed cows milk
How exactly does one become a cheese expert? I think I may have found my calling.
This video was pretty CHEESY
How does one go about becoming a cheese expert?
She said ‘right off the bat’ too many times
The way she says parmigiano reggiano bothers me so much
She is the wife of Sheogorath!
Impressive
I guessed these all right. Guess I'm an expert too lol
I'm lactose intollerent why am i watching this!
you gotta have that goat cheese.
To really see if she can distinguish between a cheap or an expensive one would be a blindfold test. That way you could see if there is actually any point in spending more.
Legend has it. She once got trapped in a mouse trap
got all of these right just sayin' why is she so proud of herself this is lame
Why do I always end up watching stuff Id never watch ,never look for and have no interest in....when im gone past the point of tired.
this woman is gorgy !
Swiss cheese doesnt recieve EU subsidies given swizterland isnt in the EU.
i like how the knife also looks like cheese
"parmegiano regiano" omg... please spell it correctly, the differences is : italian food is the best, american food is a chunk of fat.
Okay Youtube, I'm going to watch this video now, geez...
"What's your job" "Study cheese everyday"
Teacher:"what do u want to be when u grow up?" Me:"a cheese pro"
her breathe must smell awful after this
i bet she loves giving head
She looks like a mixture between Neds wife and this one blonde from Buzzfeed that tried weed for pain
Your cheesing me
What cheese expert do?
so darker colour = more expensive
Ew
I could tell which were the expensive cheeses just by looking alone therefore I must be more of a cheese expert than Liz!
“parmeséãāäænñ cheese”
wow she's amazing
a "cheese expert..."  she's not super ugly -- so, i'm assuming she's not a virgin -- but "cheese experts" likely scare off virtually all potential suitors (aka she's been single a long time).
2:24 They printed an Irish flag instead of Italy....
Cheese experts>meme creators       NO JUST KIDDING _inhale the memes exhale the memes inject the memes into my bloodstream there are good memes there are bad memes why have they abandoned us_
6:04 “I do know my stuff, no, just kidding...” *is called a **_cheese expert_*
This is my favorite video on the Internet.
Ok, I watched it, you can take it off my recommended now...
I don't know why I have a crush on her after watching this video.
What is that smell aged cheese? No my girl friend just has her legs open.
Who as a little kid says “I wanna be a cheese expert”
I’m not fascinated with cheese but more so people who have such a deep knowledge in one subject very interesting to watch a true master of something talk about something you have no clue about and use everyday
White people
Parmesan Reggiano. I buy mine at the italian store or the cheese store where they cut it off from the wheel and  the aroma is amazing. Best cheese for my Ceasar salad, makes a difference if its the right cheese and anchiovy
what makes it different between cheap and expensive mozzarella?
Aged cheese= tastes worse/ costs more= scam
Should've been blindfolded
Its 3 in the morning why am i watching this?
She's kind of hot.
Cheese Expert?      ok
I'm italian and I think it is funny how she pronounce parmigiano reggiano, but I kinda like it
Now I really want cheese
Cheeeeeeeese
walter whites wife ? da fack XD
how hard was that? just pick the one with a rind vs without a rind or the darker of the two
The aged goat cheese was not 5x more expensive because the units of measurement were different.  A was $4/4oz, or 1$/oz.  B was $20/6oz, or $3.33/oz.  So it was 3.33 times as expensive.
So basically, the older, darker cheeses are more expensive than their younger, brighter counterparts?  Don't really need to study to know that, imo.
I just realised I'm the cheese expert!
She's claiming to be a cheese expert and cannot even pronounce the names correctly.
She is a cheese expert I am a professional cheese consumers
Not an expert and got all of them right.
where the heck do they get these prices. I love cheese and each all types and never saw such high prices as they have here. Especially the cheaper cheese, 15 dollars a lb? are you nuts? lol
P A R M I G I A N O R E G G I A N O
I fking HATE cheese
This is great.
what a lovely lady
I've had $50 a lb. cheese on Rodeo Drive in California.
I was able to guess which were the more expensive ones just by looking at them. You do not need to be an expert to notice quality.
i’m gonna wrap some mozzarella sticks in leaves and sell them for $65 a stick
I can tell the more expensive one, it's the one the looks older.
she must have nasty farts
Wow this lady knows her cheeses. Enjoyed watching.
Cheese expert? Is that a cereer?
Ah, it made me sad when I saw her wedding ring. Loved this vid, thanks!
Cheese experts talk so cool
marry me
"It's 5 times more expensive" this is why you're the cheese expert and not the math expert.
4:27 you mean like you?
"It tastes like a salty crayon" Yum! Just what I wanted to spend 29$ per pound on
rubish american cheese made of pasteurised milk... You have no clue what s a good cheese
I hate cheese, why am I watching this
What do you want to be when you grow up  A cheese expert   Okay then... 🧀 🧀
So... a mouse?
she said cheese people  ummm we call them europeian
lf she's an expert than this isn't guess work...
That more expensive Alpine style cheese looks like Pleasant Ridge Reserve.
How did i get here?
didnt expect to learn so much, thanks :}
I Barely know if it's actually cheese  looking at it😑.How do u do thattttttt?
While cheese here in the Philippines tastes like rubber...... with a pinch of salt.
Why does this occupation exist and why did I watch the entire video
Older looking one is more expensive
i want to eat cheese with you, in the moonlight!
1am on Christmas morning and i just watched an 11minute video of a woman comparing cheeses .... I’m not a loser at all 🤗
How does one become a cheese "expert"?
My real question is how I become a cheese expert?
dayum this lady knows her CHEESE
1:06 that cheese went in her nose
White people be coming up with careers out of thin air
I’m not a cheese expert and I got all these correct
I bet she has dank farts
I guess them all. I think I'm a cheese expert. That was pretty easy.
I guessed em all and I don’t know how to spell cheez I actually hate cheez
She fats at 1:17 lmao
If she can be a cheese expert, then I'm going to be a junk food expert😂
**is lactose intolerant**  my dream job
Why is WALLACE not here he went to the moon for cheese for Christ sake
“Cheese expert”
''it has these'' ..then high pitch voice ''in it'' man i love white women
So... what do you do for a living?  ''I'm an official cheese expert''
Sounds cheesy
Why did she slice a lot when she knew she would just pinch and tried a bit? I hope she didn't throw away the rest of the crumbs..
Always go with the old looking one
20 dollars / 6 oz is not 5 times more expensive than 4 dollars /4 oz...
like dude i can tell it all by look lol
I wanna be a cheese expert
I’ve been drinking milk for 14 years of my life can I be a milk expert?
'I was right' - could she pat herself on the back anymore
I knew the feta one by sight.
*_S M E L L S   K I N D A   N U T T Y_*
yung cheese
"Hi, here's a cheese expert who is going to guess everything right. Darn, here we were, thinking that this would be a cool vid idea.'
Baby rind on me....relax your mind take your time with cheese
I guessed all the right answers just by looking not smelling or tasting it would have been better for her to be blindfolded
She said CHEESE so many times I started to hate the word. Lmao
why no info on the makers?  Here's the best blue cheese in the world, but figure it out for yourself.
This is gonna sound cheesy but i love cheese <3
Wow! Cheese in the US is expensive.
Im not even a cheese expert and I got them right.
I am no expert and I could tell the expensive ones just by looking at it. The cheese wich looks more disgusting is the expensive one, am I an expert now?
So what was the expensive blue cheese?
Oh, shut up you guys. No one cares if you think being a "cheese expert" is a stupid job. She's legitimately good at it
I quit.
It would have been better if she just tasted it and didn't have the advantage of looking at it first
This broad farts at 1:18
nothing amazing about the guessing, could have done it myself.
she sure knows how to waste cheese
Expert in cheese hmm. Can I be an expert in cardboard?
Its Parme *san* god damn. Not Parme *shaan*
Have you seen the video where wine "experts" can't tell the difference between cheap and expensive red wines? This lady knows her stuff.
Umm.. you already knew which one it was because you put it there. Also you're a bit wrong on some of your points, and are literally reading off their label for some of your 'info'.
This is a fantastic video, what an awesome way to learn about new things!
ive got some cheese for you!
you don't need to be an expert to see wich one is more expensive.
4:00 20/6 vs 4/4... :thinking: definitly 5 times more expensive
6:40 unexpected patriotism
I CHEEZED WATCHING THIS.
It’s 5 in the morning and I’m watching a woman explain cheese prices to me
CHEESY BONELESS PIZZA
why would someone become a cheese expert
I literally thought this said “Chinese Expert...” I need sleep
This was obvious from just looks
wait I have a test tomorrow what am I doing?
Now, how do you get this job?
I was watching BuzzFeed and now I'm here :o
lol I am not even a professional and I could've told you this
This woman is too racist
I could guess which cheese was more expensive without even being there and before she said anything. The producers could've made it more challenging.
Her eyes look like a mouses eyes no wonder she's a cheese expert
Gday curd nerds!
Why is ther an Irish flag for italy
Being that is called "PARMIGIANO-Reggiano", maybe it is made around Parma and neighbouring areas, what do you think? Just saying.
Please do a Masterclass
"I think I need to taste them" C'mon, you said that for all of them, you just wanted to eat some good cheese for free ;) I would too lmao
Crayon with salt vs creamy and sweet cheese candy. Hmm....
I love that she is giving a lot of information without being pretentious like so many wine, cheese, and other food experts!!!
too easy to guess
grujer, grüüjeeereee
That women knows her cheese
OK lads. We now know that more expensive cheese are usually older and has better rind than the other.
I want to eat cheese now so bad.
Wheres the casu marzu?
Honestly, this cheese expert wasn't really challenged in this video. Just utilizing basic knowledge of cheese I could've guessed all of the cheeses.
Whenever she mentions its young I always go 'aaaaahw'. Then I remember its just cheese lol.
I want to be a cheese expert
How exactly do you become a Cheese Expert?
Ehhh, i'll stick with Cheddar Ruffle chips😂😂
I was hoping for a blindfolded test.
2 million views. Most well paid cheese sniffer on earth.
Bet she ain't vegan
So what do you do as your job?  Oh, I determine if cheese is cheap or not
Could any body else smell cheese while watching this
I could be a cheese expert, I love cheese. Where do I sign up
1:18 letting a quick one rip like
Dang I learned a lot just from cheese
btw the goat cheese is 3.33 more money not 5 times 4/4=1 20/6=3.33
I literally guessed them all
A food expert that can actually tell the difference between foods they are an expert in? Stop the presses!     I know that sounds sarcastic but after so many videos of these "experts" getting swerved hard, it's kind of nice to see someone who knows their stuff.
Even the super expensive cheese seemed to be somewhat reasonably priced. Like, with a lot of other gourmet foods you get massive price differences and insane, unjustifiable prices at the high end, but $50 a pound for apparently one of the most expensive cheeses out there is not that bad.
If she can’t do that simple task then why would she be a cheese expert
i could watch you day long
Thorpe.
I'm not even a cheese expert and I could tell which is the more expensive
I want her job
4:04 More like, about 3.4x more expensive.  Not 5x.
She just told history just by looking at the cheese. Wtf.
I'm guessing B, the $28/lb cheese in the Alpine style round is Pleasant Ridge Reserve. #andyhatchtag
Why am I here I don't like cheese that much
Cool so the more disgusting and less appealing it looks for the average human being = more expensive, so when do I get my payment as a certified cheese expert?
“I do know my stuff. No. Just kiddin 🤓” a typical nerdy joke 😂😂
she cuts of too much cheese for just a single bite tbh
4:16 knew it cause A still had the wrapper and it was not a fancy looking wrapper
That's rogue valley premium blue, it's in my fridge lol
you know if someone has a weird name they have a weird expertise
I'd have liked to see this blind folded? How much of taste is biased by expectation?
Find the diffrence  🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂☺🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
My mom just cut the cheese                🧀🤢
She keeps on cutting the cheese.
she is full of s***
um did she fart at @1:18 ?
I thought she is an expert to smile on photos ...
Can anyone think of anything besides this broad’s farts?
Looks a bit like Skylar from breaking bad.
Wait a minute, that first expensive one is Italian yet there's an Irish flag on the little sign. Something doesn't add up here. Is your camera ok?
This just goes to show that any moron can have a job. A cheese expert?? That is what this world is coming to.
Cheese expert. Cut different cheeses with the same knife... Next time, wine degustation with only one glass
i like that they tell you why it's more expensive as well
Why Gooda? Why not Gowda? It's that easy...
Is no one going to address how beautiful the knife she uses to cut the feta cheese is?
Didn't take an expert to tell which ones were higher quality xD
lol I guessed them all correct just based on how they look, and I don't even like cheese. Should have been a blind taste test.
Did she just fart at 1:17 ???
It’s interesting but anyone who eats cheese can tell which is the expensive one, even just from looks
Une experte en fromage qui nous parle de brie-like pour un chevre? Non mais j'y crois pas!  Doom
I think they screwd up with the editing on the Feta. She said that the expensive Greek one tastes like salty crumbs, and the cheper American cows milk one is excellent. And then she says that you should spend the extra money on the Greek Feta which tastes like salty crumbs.
the rotten ones are more expensive
why im a watching this, i dont even eat cheese
You are what you eat. Guess what she smells like down there?
Basically, anything that might in other situations indicate that it may not be safe to eat indicates, in cheeses, that it is more expensive. go figures.
Her neck is gross.
The real title should be: Cheese expert does her job.
does anyone else find cheese repulsive
Damn this girl knows her cheese
Can I get this person to come with me next time I buy cheese
its 2 am
I got every one right.. Where is my price?
All of these were incredibly obvious...
I really want cheese now...
Cheese experts: This tastes like grass-fed cow milk produced in the mountains.  Me: 🤨🤨 This tastes like cheese...
4/4 = 1  20/6 = 3.333 The goat cheese is 3 times more expensive not 5 times. But it's mostly the fault of whoever was in charge of labeling the price... Price should be for a set weight.
Now that I've wasted 11 minutes of my life. I'm going back to Reddit
Found my dream job
what does it take to be a cheese expert? i like guesses every cheese right and i don't know anything about cheese.
funny, because of her american accent, I have a hard time viewing her as an expert. I guess I just don't associate culinary sophistication with americans. i'm aware it's a bias, but what can I do. in my mind, an american accent is a working class accent
There are useless careers, and then
I could listen to this woman talk about cheese all day.
The only one I thought I would like the cheaper version better was the feta. That last one looks glorious.
Anyone notice the fart at 1:18?
I guess I'm a cheese expert too then because I chose them all correctly within seconds just by looking at them. Where's my check?
Cheep Parm in #1 is a rip-off, sorry perhaps it is just living in Texas where stuff is cheap and having good groceries but I work at a a place that those will be 25-35 and 5-7 USD a pound.
I guessed all of the cheeses right, obviously without tasting haha. I don't like most of them but the older they are, the more fermented and flavorful they'll be, so more expensive. I probably don't know anything about cheese but I'm pretty sure most people in France know this.
Not really a cheese expert more like a rocket scientist or a brain surgeon -  Younger and Domestic = Cheaper,  Older and Imported = More Expensive - I'm astonished at her insight (slaps forehead and sobs gently into hands)
Please teach about wine too
Those knives! #knifeenvy
I don't even like cheese and I'm watching this?
I dont know how i ended up here but i liked it learn something new again in youtube :3
1:17 *she farts*
This taste test is rigged.  And it's rigged by the taster.
Wife material
She got all of them right,  where is the fun in that..😶
From the thumbnail, for a moment I thought you are Cynthia Nixon 😂
'right off the bat....'
Tried the rogue river blue with a coffee stout called "big bad baptist", completely changed my perception of blues.
No cheddar? I'm hurt. I'm deeply hurt.
She has very gouda skills
They tried this with wine experts. Wine experts are scam artists apparently
I got every single one right. (Not a cheese expert. -_-)
I love this cause she knows what is what. More vids like this
I'm sorry but this video is too cheesy
This is a excellent class. Thank you
I guess you can she's "cheesy to the bone".
Gil Thorpe?
is there like a school for this. wth
To note a small possible improvement: The cheeses should have all been priced by the same unit. Either oz or lb. That way you could get a proper comparison both within each type, and across the whole range.
You forgot one! Kraft slices versus Dollar Tree cheese-food slices.
Am I the only one who thinks this is obvious?
I was expecting this to be more pretentious. I actually really like this video.
Bet she smells like cheesepuffs 24/7
How does one become a cheese expert?
Déjà elle à ni de pain ni de vin donc elle peut pas vraiment goûter  avec l'expertise la pauvre :p
As an italian I can say that every italian could easily understand which one is the more expensive withouth being a cheese expert...
Well, i seems like im a Cheese expert now.. theres nothing special to say which one is the cheaper one or not
Cheesiest video I have seen tonight
i want her to b my mom for some reason, also she reminds me of claire from modern family
stepladder creamery - cambria california - check it out @ http://stepladdercreamery.com
Try my cheese
At 2:26 you're using an Irish flag. Shouldn't it be Italian??? :-D :-D :-D
right off the bat
I could have told you the first two that's just obvious
All expensive cheeses look autistic
LOL....when you think as an American you are 'distinguished' when you can tell cheeses apart, but anyone from Europe knows where any cheese is from by heart.
Take a shot every time she says "right off the bat"
It's always fun to see Americans talking about food. You realize that stuff every kid knows in Europe about food, is totally mind blowing for Americans. Must be hard to live on a continent where nobody ever grows it's own food outside, or knows the people who produced the food...
Dang, she already has a ring..
The aged goat cheese was only 3.3 times more expensive since it was $20/6oz vs $4/4oz. That comes out to be $3.33/oz for the aged cheese and $1/oz for fresh.
What exactly does a cheese expert do?
Don't wanna kiss her after that...
Irish flag?
Old and darker is always more expensive. I could have guessed these easily. It is all just age with cheese and wine.
4:10 yo who's out here sitting with their friends eating cheese?
If it taste awful its the most expensive. They should of brought the US banned import cheese. Its the one that has maggots in the cheese.
Legend has it, this woman has not taken a dump in 15 years.
can someone please tell me why im not a cheese expert
Parmigiano regiano nnaggia a te
I read cheese as chinese
I couldn't sleep and youtube led me to this video.
So if I wrap some cheese with some leaves it’ll triple in price? Okay cool.
the second one was 5 times more expensive for 1.5 times as much so it was less than 5 times more expensive.
You can be an expert, but you can't spell Parmigiano Reggiano. Poor.  And that is not Parmigiano Reggiano in any way.. I'm Italian ;)
OF COURSE THE AGED ONES WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE DUH
4:05 actually it's not 5 times more expensive... That's because it's 6 oz vs 4 oz so it's only about 4 times more expensive
Why am I watching this?I hate cheese....
Okay but how does she not have dairy acne or fat pimples as a cheese expert, you would have to taste cheese many times and one would probably get pimples from it. She might be past the age of getting regular dairy acne but just curious..?
So, great video very interesting, lots of info, but would have liked to see a blindfolded taste test and then the explanation for the choice.
i watched the whole video, and i don't even like cheese
Goat milk cheese is always whiter than cow milk cheese. 5 minutes later - here is some cow milk cheese which is whiter than the goat milk cheese from earlier.
Liz, it won't matter whether you are eating cheap or expensive cheese, as you will still be building chunks of plaque in your arteries, and compromising your health is very serious ways.
6:08 - and now that I am here.. She suddenly seems to know that the cheese thats local to the US and was described as especially amazing and much better than the swiss (aka original alpine style cheese) one, and that there is one specific farm who does that.. I see what you are doing Epicurious.. But this has to be marked somehow if I know you advertising laws right over there..
4:45 - but (especially in the US) this is no sure sign.. because beta carotin is something you can add to the cheese.. so watch out for the ingredients on the package if you find a quite dark yellow alpine cheese, if they write beta carotin, its faked probably
This shows some people have way too much free time
i think this is fake 6:02
If that's what it takes to be a cheese expert I would be a cheese expert right now
4:05  $20/6oz is not 5 times more expensive versus $4/4oz. Its 3.33 times
the lady was really nice and genuine
She knows her stuff.  I wish they listed exactly what manufacturer/brand each cheese was, though.
I can only tell the difference between vegan cheese and cheese cheese
was that supposed to be hard to tell, i could tell all exept feta
her brain is cool
I will never know as much about anything as she knows about cheese.
marry me!
this videos is actually really interesting, she is so good in her job and also really pretty ❤❤
Oh man.. i wanna be a cheese expert... hmmmmmgggg
Can't believe I spent 11 minutes watching a video on cheese. *subscribes*
Her knife is like swiss cheese
You can control white people with cheese
lesson learned, the more mouldy and old the cheese looks, the more expensive it is
In ones like this you should have made her guess the price range
More cheese videos please
It was pretty obvious...
The more nasty = the better and more expensive
and not that difficult to fap on, either
Why does the italian cheese have an irish flag ? 2:24
I only guessed the feta cheese wrong and that's only because i couldn't taste it. You don't need to be a cheese expert to know which one is more expensive.
THANK GOD YESSSSSSS!YESSSSSS!YESSSSSSS
This tastes like the cow got into an onion patch
Obvious.
imagine the farts tho🤣
wtf this is so ez
My procrastination has gone so far that I'm watching a video about different types of cheese... and I'm lactose intolerant.
it seems that with cheese, spending more pays.
How does one become a cheese expert?
I just grabbed some cheese after this video
1:18 fart
even i could guess that
well they mixed up the Irish Flag and the Italian Flag
I'm no cheese expert or whatever but I can recognize a Grana Padano (like 100 times better than american parmisan) from Parmigiano Reggiano (another league). I don't know why she says "i can't even tell much the difference". I can even understand if a Parmigiano Reggiano has been purchase pre-grated (which is worst) or it has just been grated.
every time she says parmeshano reshiano, an italian died...
I don't like cheese because they always give me the bad cheese to taste. Someone recommend me some good cheese.
She's wife material
She makes me want to learn more about cheese.
i dont need a cheese expert to see which cheese is more expensive without even tasting..
is she a vegan
Your defentaly a cheese expert
I demand a rematch! This time, blindfolded. 😂
i hate cheese
I'm impressed but I still think that no one is supposed to know this much about cheese.
I’ll stick with my 25 cent a pound string cheese
I may be in the wrong place because I hate cheese
cheese expert? serously it's like common knowledge where i live..
lol the blue cheese... Sadly for her roquefort is illegal in usa... So she got to eat her wonderfull blue cheese as"the cheese she would eat once a year" lmao. Sérieux, un putain de bon roquefort papillon noir,  je suis sûr que ses papilles "d'expert en fromage" ne sont pas préparés...
How did i get here...
This is one of the most engrossing videos I've watched in a while
All the darker cheeses demonstrated are more expensive
at 1:18 was that a fart?
I'm not a cheese expert, but even I knew these things, and guessed the more expensive cheese.
Why was the first expensive cheese have a irish flag?
Oh i want to study to be a Cheese expert....
I dare someone to eat an entire block of blue cheese..
Marry me.
For once, an expensive food expert that actually deserves to be called that.
*cry in lactose intolerance*
By the first look on the video you can tell which is more expensive (rustic look) no expert needed for that :/
Man, i also would give that anwers, u just have to look
How did I get here...
Well boys i found my calling
tfw your future cheese wife has a wedding ring
baaah, I hate cheese
I literally know nothing about cheese, but I got every one right just based on appearance...
Miranda Hobbes is that you?
I hate how she pronounces parmigiano as par-meh-jhan instead of par-mee-gia-no.
I don't even like cheese... why am I here??
Groundbreaking. My life was changed because of this video. I feel like I am a better person and that my soul has evolved a thousand years or so. This was beautiful. In this video I seen my future children and my own death. Bravo.
I think I need to taste YOU...   ;)           how you doin' ?!! ;)
I think she will be constipated after all the cheese she ate... lol
mmm
1:16 did yall hear that fart? lmao
Could you please tell me who cut the cheese
The difference between cheap and expensive cheeses seems more substantial than between cheap and expensive wines :o
Im no expert and I only got one guess wrong
Went into this video not expecting much and too click off, watched the whole thing and was pleasantly surprised, very informative and awsome presentation
You can't do a nice cheddar?  No one who isn't rich or pretentious eats these cheeses.
Go vegan!
Did anyone hear the far at 1:15
Ok this lady is insain
Oh yeah, cheeeeeeese.  Didn't we lock you in a dumpster one time?
So, what do I do for a living?  *ya kno... imma cheese expertanto.*
B chesse in 2nd test wasnt 5times more expensive :S
2:27 i'm pretty sure they used the irish flag instead of the Italian
How does one qualify as a "cheese expert"
I guessed all of them...IM A GENIUS
yooo, where do i go to become a cheese expert???
I tried to age my cheese, now its all green coloured. I think i will sell it for 50$/lb because this is the only green coloured cheese in my fridge.
I thought this was buzzfeed
I should be a cheese expert. I knew which was more expensive straight off the bat
greek feta is sooo good
Im french so i know that even i don't learn that anywere .. Its genetic..And she don't know what brie is .. This is clearly not brie
she may know cheese.. but she doesnt know math.... 4$/4oz    and 20/6oz   is not 5 times the difference..... not only did she make the mistake, but then decided to put it online as well
Is it me or the flag for the first one looks like the Irish flag and not the Italian one?
A: I search a Job B: oh ok what did you study I'm sure I can help you! A: I studied Cheese B:........What?!...…..
Wow, I got all but one correct. I must be a cheese expert. Pay me moniez!
I know cheese is cool, not to mention DELICIOUS! But why would anyone want to be a.. cheese expert? 😂
I didn't even have to taste them to tell the difference, and I hardly ever eat cheese :P
Weird test. I got all of them right just by looking. Next time taste blindfolded and then explain........
i learned some interesting cheese facts today :O
How did I get here? I have to study for finals 😂
The one that is aged which I mean all of them don't look too good.
I just fell in love with u
Im lactose and i hate cheese so I don't know why i'm watching this
pleasantly surprised to find an expert that actually knows in a blind taste test what is what.
Why in the world would cheese be regulated????? I think I'm believing on the cheese conspiracy now.
I protecc  I attacc  But mostly , Y’all lookin leik a snacc
I wasn’t surprised they were white
uglier cheeses are more expensive lol mazu cazu hahaha
ive had the cheese shown at 4:52 and mine was aged, but i got it for cheap with a coupon. And it was the best thing i ever tasted. Go try it lol
i was expecting this to be one of those videos where they shame experts into wrongly predicting cheaper stuff is good but no.
She sure knows her cheese.
An American cheese “expert” 😂 from the country that has cheese in a can. Go home
The EU is heavily subsidising the dairy industry in the EU, correct. But (surprise, surprise!) Switzerland is not part of the EU, thus they won't get a single €, or better a single Swiss franc. BTW: E.g. Emmentaler AOP will necessarily be made of milk from gras fed cows.
10 $ for a pound of genetically manipulated cow milk American feta?  Hahaha,  In Germany you can get 5 pounds for the same price AND good milk.
lets play a game:  drink every time she says cheese
As soon as the blue cheese shows up my mouth fills with water
Why is the Parmigiano Regiano presented under the Irish flag?
Umm... didn't they put Irish flag rather than Italian in first comparison? :D Differences can be very subtle, depending on various sources, but this one looks a bit too orangish fot Italian. Correct me if I'm wrong ;)
How does one become a cheese expert?
If this was (real) Gruyère AOC, it's also from grass fed cows, because in order to have their cheese called that way, "cheese makers" have to feed their cows with grass (that's one of the requirements).
She is supposed to be an expert but she can't even pronounce it right. I mean the fcking Parmigiano Reggiano
plus...european cheese is from animals that arent fed gmo crap.
useless to teach americans, they probably put ketchupon it anyway.
These are my kind of people. I really do need to get into the professional culinary world.
How does one become a cheese expert. I may be mildly allergic to cheese but I how do I do it.
of course a cheese expert is white lol
which tastes better?
I am no expert at all but i would have got 100% of these right just by looks, unless you have zero clue about what fermentation looks like, longer age=more expensive every time.
Comments: “ I guessed all of them right without being a cheese expert”
how can I become a cheese expert? :)
What type of blue cheese was the last one?
Kucing
I'm not even an expert and they were pretty obvious which was more expensive
For the feta cheese they just reused the same shot of her grabbing a piece from B, so you can't tell for sure which cheese she's commenting on
Knows her cheese... but terrible math. 4$/4oz vs 20$/6oz... thats not 5x
Wow one looks fancy and one doesnt I wounder what cost more?
After eating more types of cheese I can’t go back to bad processed cheese
I forgot this was even a challenge, it was just enjoyable to watch in general
I went on YouTube to try and remember the unit circle... how did I get here?
She literally eats cheese for a living.
shes smart asf on cheese
Such a humble cheese eater she is.
Flawed from the start. If she a cheese "expert" she Gon know.
How does one become a cheese expert
The Italian flag in the first tasting looks like the flag of Ireland
The more expensive goat cheese is about 3x more expensive… Who made that card? Using different units and comparing is a terrible idea.
1:17 lol i heard that
I guess this video is a bit cheesy hahahaha ok sorry
It seemed like she liked the cheaper cheeses better. She always had less of the expensive ones. Im guessing the flavor is too strong. Probably better for seasoning.
good job sharon
what am i doing right now
Lmao contradicting yourself much?  BTW make no mistake the swiss cheese is better.
Last time I checked your mom wasnt a cow.....
Cheese has casomorphins, which are in the same chemical family is opiates... It is more addictive than opiates though. Dont fall for the trap. Dairy is scary. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcN7SGGoCNI&t=39s
Cheese is amazing i make cheese every 3 days or so and have a stock pile of homemade amazing cheese's from Mozzarella to Parmesan and even Goats milk Its become a main ingredient too my cooking and diet making your own cheese is also massively Inexpensive, Say i make that Blue cheese it would cost me about 10% or even less to make my self just a long wait before you can taste the final product haha but its worth it Especially if you get Raw Milk straight from the farmer and best at spring time
Where’s Charlie Kelly?
nerd
Did anyone else notice that between 7:29 - 7:33 she took the same cheese twice but said they were both different?
taste it blind, then you can call her a real expert
damn she was on point
anyone else hear the fart at 1:17?
Guys, I'm a pizza expert if you ever need one of those. HMU if you need me to taste test them for you.
Cows can make milk but can milk make cows?
Cheese expert my ass, without beeing cheese expert I could guess which ones were more expensive.. maybe coz I am french?
this is the Ireland flag , not the italian flag
How cant you tell aged gouda from aged parmesian ..... there two completly dofferent cheeses wtf
Last one is easy, it's obviously Rogue River blue.  The pear brandy soaked grape leaves give it away.
i hate cheese and she makes me want to eat cheese
I'll eat all of them and I don't care how expensive or cheap if its food I'll eat it
Thorpe is so close to my name... what..? that's an odd name...
FINE I'LL WATCH IT YOUTUBE. THE FUCK.
Wow she's pretty good.
"How much cheese have you eaten today?!"  "...How much cheese is too much cheese?"  "Any amount of cheese before a date is too much cheese!"
More informative than funny. Very disappointing. I totally came here for laughs.
Blue cheese has mold in it
Now, do it blindfold by taste only
$15/lb for crappy american cheese? wtf!
I want some cheese now
Good girl
Fuck, I want some. :'(
And here i am buying 1.99 cheese lmao 😔😂
Y’all outta Hmu next time I’m a self proclaimed cheese guru
does she poop ok?
Oops!  You picked up (and I assume tasted) Feta B both times. Which did you actually like?
Charlie Kelley is the only master of cheese.
how tf you become a cheese expert? is there some college degree you need or do you just gotta be a weirdo that way too into cheese?
I DO NOT GIVE A SINGLE FUCK ABOUT WHAT OLD CHEESE LOOKS LIKE
theres something cheesy about this video
I love cheese
4:18 i thought that was airplane cheese and i was like wtf? Lol
parmeSan not parmeshan
Maybe if they actually fucking switched the position of the cheeses the dumb bitch would have gotten it wrong
thats a good test she did it all alone
You should try communist Berg, greeat stuff, worth the cost ($50 - for fattening)
totally couldn't guess the cheese covered in leafs would be the most expensive....
in cheese  if it looks old and rotten its probably more expensive          also f u auto correct
Whatever cheese looks the oldest ... IS NORMALLY MORE EXPENSIVE. ALSO I'd smash
ok she literally said the american feta tasted better before she knew...and then said it was a good time to splurge on the more epensive greek feta after she found out...
4:02 $4/4oz is not 5 times more expensive than $20/6oz. Per ounce, the first is $1 and the second is $3.33, or 3 and 1/3 times the price. Math!
Cheese expert
They went so easy on this bitch. I ain't even a cheese expert and it was pretty obvious which cheeses were more expensive.
She's so white lmfao
you can already tell solely by the looks of the cheese which one is the more expensive.
par-mae-zarn-no rae-giee-a-nou lmao I cringed so hard.
how does one become a cheese expert?
Cheese *EXPERT*? God if I could switch jobs for a day. 1. I'd have the cheese of my life and 2. She'd be doing nothing because I'm unemployed
Clicked for the violet eyes, stayed for the cheese facts.
So basically just pick the older one.
Kraft singles are exquisite
who wants to eat a crayon with salt crystals :U
How does one become a cheese expert
Right off the bat...
I got the feta wrong because of the 'saltiness' she described. I always associate 'too salty' with cheap.
1:19 Is that a fart that I heard lmao
1:18 You hear a fart! 😂Lol.
I hate cheese so much
I wish I was a cheese expert.
I clicked because I thought Kate McKinnon was a cheese expert.
I got almost all of them right!!
Eh? She said the swiss cheese was a cooked milk? Then it's not gruyere. AOC gruyere is a raw milk cheese.
Yah I don't know anything about cheese and I could guess these pretty easily
She's so knowledgeable, I'm impressed
I want this lady's job
I could do this too, she just describes what she is seeing. I could do this too and logically say which one is the more expensive one
#onlyhereforthethumbnail
A good cheese taster, but can't do math. 4:00, 5 times more than the other cheese? It's 6 oz vs 4 oz!
Wow, that girl is clever! Not only that, cheese hot!!! Lol.
I didn't see her do american vs. velveta.
01:18 someone farted
lolz, cheese expert thinks $4 / 4oz times 5 equals $20 / 6oz (it is 3,66... times more expensive)
Love this video n she’s she knowledgable! Wish she had shared the brand of the expensive blue cheese!
Stop talking and eat more cheese.
wtf biting into a crayon?
I'd let her eat my cheese
I hate cheese ewww
Cheese in the US is retardedly overpriced xD And these fucking morons don't even mind.
It's pretty easy to guess the more expensive just from the look of things. The only one I got wrong was the feta.
How did I end here?
0:43 came to hear her say this cheese is Gouda... was not disappointed!
You don't have to be an expert to spot these differences, the rinds, exteriors are a dead give away. I could go head to head with this lady and easily discern the different cheeses. Cheese is a favorite food for moi'.
The aged goat cheese was not 5x more expensive because the price was for 6 oz while the $4 price of the fresh goat cheese was for 4 oz
they cut this a bit strange, so many times she'll say "this one" or "that one" without saying A or B and they cut so you aren't sure what she is talking about.
So if you are on a tight budget, usually cheese type "A" is the cheapest, it that right? I learned so much!
Cheese expert....can't pronounce Parmigiano Reggiano
Why ask an expert to guess the price😂
what about maggot cheese?
Why am I watching this video...
THERE IS A CHEESE EXPERT?
she doesnt know how to fucking cut cheese wth
That woman has the greatest job that has ever existed.
Cheese expert can't pronounce "Reggiano" properly
me in 10 years
you know your life is downhill when your an expert in fucking cheese
I don’t like cheese
Just imagine how her farts smell 😵
didn’t expect a cheese lady to be so woke.
I LOVE Gruyère 😍😍😍 i mean i am half suisse.. But still 🤫
Jesus Christ I can get  Parmesan Reggianno for about 17 dollars a pound where I live
I do not like the crystals in my cheese, 8 months aged is my max (excluding blue cheese)
PARMESAN WHERE MY ACCOUNTANT LIVES IN FACT I'M DOWN WITH THIS
So every cheese that looks rotten is more expensive
no cheddar?!!?
I would consider myself a cheese expert😂
SOMETIMES I DREAM ABOUT CHEESE.
wow 5 for 5
her build looks like that of a man.
This lady probably only poops once a month
how the fuck do you get to be a "cheese expert" or a "tea exper" THE FUCK?!
I don't even like cheese, why am I watching this video?
dairy causes a lot of health problems like cancer etc    not to mention in diary farms they separate the calves from their mother which cause a lot of suffering (was found in a research  but you dont really need that cause its common sense that separating them would cause a lot of suffering )
what have you done in youre life?         ima cheese expert
This is one of the first "expert guesses" sort of thing, where the expert gets every one right.
American diary products are banned through out the EU Australia, New Zeeland and UK
Damn I wish my crush knows me as well as this woman knows cheeses
"I'm not sure. I'll have to taste it." Suuuure. That's why you tasted it. xD
Idk why I'm watching this. I'm lactose intolerant!!
I thought feta is vegan and that they dont consume dairy products can someone enlighten/correct me? Respect please!
i think it's disgusting how much she smells the cheese
ILOVECHEESEILOVECHEESEILOVECHEESEILOVECHEESEILOVECHEESECHEESEISBAESTCHEESEISBEST
my dog, the dog to the left there, eats parmigiana reggiano for dinner every night.(tiny amounts) Cuz she likes it. She also eats shabu-shabu beef, yum! (plus the kibble in the photo of course.)
Sometimes, I dream about cheese...
I already have to use the restroom just watching
C'mon you can be an idiot and tell which cheese is more expensive by looking at it <.<
"What do you do for a living?"  "Oh I'm a cheese expert."
oh wow a cheese expert! and why would I care?
I learned many thing thank u
1:17 ugh.. who cut the cheese?
Wait the a permasan has to be from italy but the flag is a hungary flag dafuq?
the more it tastes like ass the more expensive
i dont even really like or care about cheese but this lady is cool
Daaaaaannnnnggg this was inpressive
how did i get here
She knows cheese but not Math lol @4:00 That is NOT 5x more $ darling 😎
Im not an expert but this is not at all a challenge to her because of course the older more complex cheeses are more expensive
Is youre parents proud  that you became a "Cheese Expert"? (Idk if i spelled proud wrong or not)
I feel like a cheese expert now
Funny as fuck to watch an American rate European made cheese (real cheese)
ah yes mold black mold can kill you mold on food means it has gone bad but MOLD IN CHEESE I S FINE
1:18 - 1:19 did she fart wtf
She says splurge too,much
And I love the different knifes
I love this vid maybe bc I love cheese
Im over here trying tasting the difference between Kraft Mac and cheese and store brand
In each case, you could guess by appearance alone.
I though it said Chinese expert... Dislike
This was really good, I'm impressed!
*I FUCKING LOVE CHEESE*
what is ur favorite cheese? reply this comment to tell me :) (mine is TOTALY feta cheese!!!)
I appreciate the fact that she's not snobby about the cheaper cheese and has an appreciation and a use for them.
How does one become qualified as a “cheese expert”?
Why the fuck am I watching this?
fart  @1:18
honestly I could've gotten all of these
I knew which one was more expensive without her explanation and just by seeing the cheese i don't think i am a huge cheese conosiur but apparently it's not hard to see which one is more expensive and why...
These are so obvious by the way the cheese look...
i can tell by looking aged woman from younger woman too
i should be studying
I think those are grape leaves, they use them in Mediterranean cooking.
I'm watching this as i shove multiple string cheeses into my mouth
You weird bitch. You eat goat cheese with ur friends
I'd taste her fetid cheese any day of the week. Fnarr fnarr
Why would anyone want to be a cheese expert 😂😂
How does one become a cheese expert?
1:20 did she fart?
Mouth IS watering
I. Hate. Cheese.     Am I the only one??
Why is it almost always the uglier ones that's more expensive
?Wait why am I watching this I don’t even eat cheese¿
I wonder how much aged government cheese goes for?
I'm not a cheese expert and I could tell the difference just by watching the video , this is bull she could tell just by seeing them , should only give small portions that look the same
I bet it smelled like 1,000 farts
Crusty is the grossest word.
Mild and crumbly real yorkshire wensleydale cheese
I'll stick to my string cheese...
If I were there: Yeah guys, it taste like cheese let’s see if I’m correct
im lactose intolerant
Is that a Rouge River Blue I spy at the end? That is, hands down, the absolute best blue cheese - and in the running for best cheese of any variety - ever made by any cheese maker ever in the history of the universe.
Irish flag
She not French tf she know nothing
They put the Irish flag 🇮🇪 instead of the Italian flag 🇮🇹 in the first one
how the fuck you get a degree in cheese
So like, who actually decides one day “hey! I wanna be a cheese expert as a living!”? 😂
Its actually 3 1/3 times more expensive not 5
Egoism
Liz is amazing, had to follow her channel
*"Smells kinda NUTTY"* xD
I've been watching this non-stop
Goats cheese, "its like a brie" SERIOUSLY? Mixing goats cheese and Brie which is cows cheese?
Who else paused the vid, got some cheese, and continued watching wile crying cuz urs was literally 5 cents?
of course that is a job
How does one become a cheese expert?
Hi
Why am I watching this
Lol
I have the weirdest boner.
i'd be more impressed if this was blind tasting
This was actually really educational. cool.
Isn't the first flag irish instead of italian??
I thought this was BuzzFeed. What the fuck.
Even I am an expert. Ugliest cheese = more expensive,simple
Loved this video! More!!
I wanna be a cheese expert but I'm lactose intolerant
come on , im not cheese expert but i had 100% sucess without even trying lol :P
Plot twist—she’s lactose intolerant.
Has to be a blind taste test fuckers
Good luck getting some of these into China, where I live. They banned soft cheeses.
2:24 Talking all about how the real Parmigiano-Reggiano has to be made in certain parts of Italy and all that, CANT EVEN PRINT THE RIGHT FUCKING COUNTRY FLAG .... (Apparently Ireland and Italy are the same fucking thing) - god dammit, pay attention to the details will ya ?
1:18 fart?
FETA!🇬🇷
Expert spotted
What if this was live and she did A LOT of explaining and gets it wrong
How to get free cheese: pretend you're a cheese expert
Thought this was Buzzfeed
So it’s ok to eat expired cheese?
The nastier looking cheese is more expenisve
In case anyone was wondering the expensive blue cheese is Rogue River Blue.
The goat cheese is not five times more expensive than the other one. $4 for 4oz vs $20 for 6oz is less than three times as expensive.
I don't know why but she really irritates me.
She is sexy af!!!!
Why are people being so mean to her? A woman is good at something and a bunch of turds on the internet just hurl insults. Pathetic.
Fascinating! Thanks for the upload!
If she's such an expert, you'd think she'd pronounce the names correctly.
And shes so exact with her explanations
*SPLURGE*
YO SHE ATE THE SMALL YELLW GOAT CHEESE BRAIN
She looks like Miranda from sex & the city. 100%.
The price comparisons were way too obvious.  I think there needed to be more cheeses that were closer in price.  Maybe something to trick the cheese expert.
I don't like cheese and I know nothing about cheese but I got all of these right
Damn she is like a REAL cheese expert
very informative however not very hard to guess which is which........
SPLURGE
me
How much does a seasoned cheese expert get paid?
How to tell if the cheese is expensive:  If it looks nasty and old and brown, it's expensive
I don't know how I got here...
she could host her own sitcom and I wouldn't be mad. Internet, please make Liz Thorpe the worlds foremost cheese communicator
This is more dramatic then I think it should be. xD
Why tf am i watching this ?
4:17 i think y'all left some of the wrapper on the cheese on the left lmao
Oh my she’s so great! 😮
when ppl say there real cheese ppl trust me you dont know anything about real cheese
This turd is selling you death.  Most cheese is 75% fat. Cheese is the unhealthiest food you can eat bar none.
Who the fuck becomes a cheese expert? What are you gonna brag about it to your friends?  "Oh, you have cheeses on those little sticks? Fuck you, I only eat the FINEST cheeses, because I'm an expert on CHEESE" Why am I so angry about this?!
she looks like she'd be a cheese expert
"How much cheese is too much cheese?" -Charlie "wild card" Kelly
Guess im a cheese expert. Got them all right besides the feta, just by the first initial look.   I definitely do love me cheese
Why did I just watch this? 😂 it’s 2:05 in the morning
cheese taste and smells so bad its so gross
And her name is... Erina Nakiri the God tongue.
Anybody else notice she changed knives with each cheese
I want to scrape out the yellow stuff under my big toe and see what she says about it
Man I knew these fucking answers before she did
I got them all right      I don't even like cheese
Don't worry how much it is just eat the flipping cheese
Her shits must be awful
*Kinda NUTTY.*
Wait, their are cheese experts, oh 21st century🤦‍♂️
Parent: what do you want to be when you grow up?  Me:
1:18 did you hear that?
Was it just me or was that noise when she looked at her second cheese a fart 💩😜
-What do you do for a living? -I'm a cheese expert -Oh... And why do you have a different style of knife for every cheese -To really express my love for my job and merge with the cheeses like become one, it's kind of what I do -Uhhh. Ok just keep doing what your doing
By taste and smell only would've been more fun. Even I could spot the right ones.
I don't even like Cheese, why am I here? 😂
kinda biased on the alpine cheese....''Swiss cheese is meh,this one is on another level,because support your country,its more important than supporting the best.'' It kinda was obvious she knew on the get go.....
This video makes me happy to be vegan those rinds were fucking vile lmao
What a curd nerd
Next up...    fromunda Cheese.
Btw Swiss isn't in EU. So that doesn't apply really well.
Damn cheese woman has become a meme
I hate cheese, but i loved this video.
How to become a cheese expert: Always choose darker, mouldier and thicker cheese.  Lol dumb bitch.
she's so knowledgeable! love it!
MOM! when i grow up i wanna be a cheese expert!
I can watch her explain and eat cheese to me forever.
The lady knows her shit! she nailed it!
I’m Unmuting, and I’m a do nothing all day expert.
They fucking used tge irish flag insted of the italian one
I can’t ever be a cheese expert, I can’t just eat straight up cheese it makes me sick to my stomach, but I can eat straight up mozzarella. So yeah.
Wow she knows her cheese xD why every girl I meet loves cheese wtf xD
Nothing to say about the expert, she's fine and know the job. But, and i mean BUT, usually aged cheese is more expensive than a less aged... The right way was with SAME age cheap vs expensive. By the way, "expensive" is an incorrect word, instad you should use "properly made" (except for the swiss cheese).
i love melted bopperino sandwiches with sliced pepperone.
I love listening to her. Please make more. Make a series. ❤️
This was a pointless video from a taste test perspective. Anyone that likes a decent cheese and has basic actual cheese knowledge (I.e. Not just American brick 'cheese') could've picked the expensive ones on looks alone, aside from maybe feta. Because aged variants are always more expensive, since they have to be stored longer. Basic economic principle. The longer fabrication takes, the more expensive it is.   What I expected, and is the norm, is to see a cheap and expensive cheese of the same type pitted against each other.  Fresh goat vs fresh goat. Aged gouda vs aged gouda. The only comparison value I got was from the feta. The others were different cheeses with different uses pitted against each other. Shame.   At least I learned some more about cheese in general, even if the taste test wasn't a taste test.
This was extremely insightful
I don’t like cheese but I clicked on this video anyway
I'm lactose intollerant, yet I'm here watching cheese videos at 1AM.   Oh Youtube, give me my life back.
She has some stinky kisses and funky booty
I now fell numb when I hear or eat cheese
Seems like she cuts the cheese a lot...
Why is no one talking about how fucking gross the aged goat cheese looks.
Hate cheese. And it is so expensive, like wtf
How do I get people to ask me to be in cheese tasting videos??
But imagine being a cheese expert...
I LOVE BLUE CHEESEEEEE!!!!
Her as kid: “I want to eat cheese for a job”  Her now: Cheese expert
Im gonna buy some cheese today at woolworths....
ugly, hard earwax cheese= expensive, actual appetizing, good tasting cheese-=cheap
I could have guessed all of these, just based on the appearance, I want to see a blind taste test. That would be actually interesting.
Why she smell the first one so much
Sooo, already at test number 1, the cheese that tastes like salty crayons is the expensive one..... I will never understand the world of delicacys....
She aint an expert! everything she sais is common knowledge!
Blue cheese taste like shit
When you ask a two  year old what job they want
wtf.. how is cheese expert a job?
Nice take on this sort of video, I feel like I learned a thing or two.
You don't need to be a cheese expert to get these right. Just go for the one that looks shit.
Im 4 minutes in and im gonna go ahead and say that anyone could have got that 100% right. "Oh this one is aged" expensive. "oh this has a rind, therefore its aged." Expensive. Duh
Why am I watching this??? I don't even like cheese...
You should have made her taste blindfolded, and after she guesses show her the cheese and have her analize the look and talk about the details
What exactly is a "cheese expert"?
This is the most retarded vid on youtube. Even a random person from the street can see the difference between the expensive vs non expensive cheeses when you give them this obvious examples. Hes a new video idea,, Car expert guesses which car is more expensive.. a honda from 1990 vs a ferrari spider.  or A hummer vs a toyota aygo.  1.6 mil views guaranteed.
The one with more color and texture and has a stronger taste is the more expensive one, it goes for all. I dont think it was hard at all from what the lady described
Maybe you are an expert but you don't really fcking know how to correctly cut a fcking cheese
Beta carotene in the grass?
I like her
Her fanny smells like cheese
You can tell she has thunder thighs.
Not fair. You need to do it with cheese that looks identical
She looks like a cheese.
Fake news
She didn't even tell the name/origin/makings of the most expensive cheese, what is this, buzzfeed?
annoying cut at 7:24... cuts B cheese, but is tasting A
I fell asleep and left my autoplay on. Then I woke up and this video was playing.
do an episode with vegan cheese
2:24 They use the Irish flag instead of Italian
Mmmm i love me some dick cheess
The flag on the first cheese price tag is WRONG! This flag is from IRELAND not ITALY XD!!!
*Cheese candy*
These are the people, so involved in their job, that their whole life revolves around it. Like I'm quite certain she can be turned on just by sniffing cheese
american cheese better than swiss one *TRIGGERED*
This is stupid. I thought it was going to be a more difficult test, but the more expensive cheeses were *OBVIOUSLY* discernable by look alone.  Doesn't take a cheese expert to figure out which were the more expensive....
Where's the sausage lady at?
Man now I’m hungry for melted cheese ;-;  I’m a cheese lover But I’m also a chicken lover
In China, the cheeses are made from dog milk
Nasty ass looking cheese is more exspensive
You forgot the maggot cheese it actually tastes good I have problems
i would kick it with her
Fantastic presentation and speaking skills, very informative and a complete professional.
Now serve smartypants two versions of human cheese. That'll throw her off.
I absolutely hate cheese
Her commentary is great
Love my Bri! ...   ;)
Lol these long ass explanations when really all it takes is which one is more yellow.
familiar face
Right off the bat, I thought she was gonna be a cheese snob who dismisses the cheaper cheeses as even authentic cheese, but she gave each cheese a fair and equal review, providing educated explanation, and even went as far complimenting some of the cheaper cheese. For that, I cannot hate her.
Can’t believe I really watched a while 11 minute video about cheese
a fucking cheese expert?
what the fuk am I doing here?...
Pepper Jack Cheese 😫😫👅👅👅😩😩😫😩😩💦💦💦💦💧💧💧
We're all cheese experts, am I right
Ha what a sick job j eating cheese all day
Lesson learned: become a pro cheese maker to be on epicurious
This is a cheesy profession
Finally, someone who knows their shit.
Did you just use the Ireland flag
Nah I'm just gonna stick to eating the little velveta cheese packets. It's sooo good 😊
How the fuck does your life get to being a cheese taster? Does she get paid to do this?
aw.  she's cool.  i like her.
Ew blue cheese
The first cheese had the wrong flag for the italian lmao, that was the irish flag
1:18 did anyone else hear the sound XD
I’m going to put my cheese outside and make a profit
“Cheese Expert”.... are those really jobs? That’s so weird. I’ve never heard of that before!!!
This wasn't what I was expecting.  This is not a test of the expert but, rather, a cheese tutorial with click bait.  I prefer some water crackers and a nice red.
Why not a blind taste test?
4:04 Nope, not five times more expensive. A is $1 dollar per ounce and B is approximately $3.33 dollars per ounce.
junge ich brauch nichmal zu probieren man sieht es doch direkt welcher teurer ist
This video is so cheesy 🧀
Well done, you correctly guessed which Parmesan was the more expensive one. I could have told you that without even tasting it. I couldn't watch any more because of the pronunciation of "Parmesan".
Not so much an expert. I could tell which one was the most expensive within about two seconds of looking at them.
Uglier and older cheese is of course the most expensive. No need an expert to judge those cheese
Me when I grow up:  Eat cheese until I be a pro
I got all of them right except one and I'm not even a cheese expert.
I'm no expert but I guessed them all right just by the look
What about Protoss cheese
"What do you do for a living?"
Is no one gonna mention her violet eyes?? THEY’RE SOOOOO PRETTY
An expert doing her job: surely creative.
👏🏻the👏🏻dream👏🏻
She is impressive as heck!
I should be studying for finals...
That's an Irish flag, not an Italian flag.
I love her passion for cheese. I like cheese too
I THOUGHT IT SAID CHINESE!!  NOT CHEESE D:
i hate how she cuts a bit, bites into it and then doesn't finish it.
She got every cheese wrong and is a white supremacist. Your welcome for saving 11 mins
I am so high, and now I am craving for cheese.
How does she make money? Not being cynical, just curious 😊
Wait is the price for the other cheeses that are from other countries already in American form or is it from there and if so shouldn't they like transfer it to an American form
Lol if you pause at 5:53 you see the label on the cheese on A
Girl knows cheese but can't do math. 4 for 4oz is clearly not 5 times cheaper than 20 for 6oz.
wtf am i watching.
Great video! thanks for sharing.
Cheese is disgusting
its just charlie from asip
About feta cheese: milk-based "feta" isn't feta. We call it "salad cheese" but it's awful in salads bc it's harder and crumblier and doesn't melt in your mouth.
I honestly don't care about cheese but somehow I found this video interesting
I like Protoss cheese, plz, someone get that reference...
Shes so impressive~~
I should be doing homework, but instead I’m watching a cheese video.
Why the fuck did I watch this whole video?
guessing just by looks i only got 1 wrong this doesnt seem that difficult
Switzerland isnt in the EU
I got and ad about dairy. Spooky
So we have a holiday in Holland, called Sinterklaas (if you wanna know more just google because explaining is too complicated) and we get the first letter of our name in chocolate. BUT MY DUMBASS LOCAL STORE HAS LETTERS MADE OUT OF CHEESE 😶
I ate cheese during this.
let her examine full ad garen top next
If there chesse experts they should know cheap to expensive instantly
So the old ones are more expensive then?
she farted at 1:17
She reminds me miranda (the red head) from sex&city
She could eat my cheese
P A R M E S A N I O  R E G G I A N O
This is so wholesome
i hate cheese but i keep watching this
Peta and Mozarella are my two faves
Guessed without eating omg im GEENY PEENY
Why is this in my feed?
Taste kinda *N U T T Y*
just came from watching little kids talk shit about cheese, now don’t disappoint me cheese girl.  you didn’t fail me cheese lady
I'll be damned. She got them all right. Perhaps food expertise isn't all horseshit.
I wish she went into which tastes better rather than only guessing which is more expensive and why. Of course a cheese that is aged longer and under unique conditions will cost more. Aside from the Feta I don't think she helped me out when choosing cheeses the best cheeses for the money at my local cheese shop..
6:03 HAHAHAHA
I'm ONLY curious.. nothing sexual. Can breast milk be made into cheese??
how bout a blind test???
I like the cheddar I get from the corner shop.
So basically an expensive cheese has a obvious crust thingy
"Cheese expert"
Noooo what about camenbert
Get out of my recommended!
She knows her shit. Not one of the "experts" like in a buzzfeed video, she is an actual expert
So anyone who ate cheese at least once is already a cheese expert
i dont like cheese
“Cheese candy” yess daddy
Wait, if there are cheese experts, can there be anime experts?
TASTE THE CHEESE 🧀
so: rind = good
Was I only the only more intrigued by the type of cut ware she used based on the type of cheese it was?
I went to Greece once and dang, the cheese I tried there cost cheap but was so creamy I could spread it on some toast!  Versus the cheap feta I got when I went home, and it literally fell apart in my hands xD I feel like feta is definitely one of those cheeses but you should definitely go the extra mile and buy a little more expensive because the taste definitely changes a lot from cheap to expensive
$15 a pound=cheap=my paycheck
For a "cheese expert" as they called her she's pretty healthy unlike me🐷🐷🐷
I guess all of them right simply by looking at them. WTF is my job... smh
Man she sure likes cheese Itd be cool to eat cheese Like I mean for a living For you to get paid
damn i wanna be a cheese expert
Why the fuck am I watching this?
One thing she DOESN'T MENTION are CHESS made out of ROW MILK, that takes the CHESS two a MORE INTENSE FLAVOR.... it's still cashing up in the US, ....
I’d let her fart in my face.
She won from seeing the age...
I mean, some of these cheeses you could have served in a plastic bag and the other on a golden plate. Even to someone who knows nothing about cheese it's pretty obvious which one is more expensive.
well this was uber fucking stupid anyone could guess this shit wtf cool u eat old ass cheese and werent blindfolded and already knew all the answers so fucking dumb why do people watch this shit????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Craving for some jarlsberg now
She gets it right 5 outta 5!!
We get it, you're stuck up with your fancy names, fancy cheeses, and fancy wines
why wasn't there string cheese there
This video makes me gassy.
She gonna be constipated LOLLLLLLLLLL
I love cheese
Yeah,  and I'm a porn expert
This helped with my cheese withdrawals. I only had cheese once today
OK....but you don't need to be an expert to know which is the more expensive cheese...you just need eyes...it was VERY obvious which was more expensive...
How do  you  become a cheese expert  and why
+Epicurious Hardly a guess between cheap and expensive. Given she already knows what cheeses are to be in the segment, and what to say about them. Its all fully planned out. Still a nice video.
hey did u come from the l word?
I guessed all of them just by looking 😂
Yeah cuz 20/6 is 5 times as much as 4/4
Why wasn't she blindfolded.
I can only downvote once? I'm disappointed ...
I always like a creamy non aged cheese it always tastes better to me than an aged normal cheese
So what's the name of the expensive blue cheese?
Geez, she knows her stuff
why do her eyes anoy me so much?!
Why was this in my recommend? Why am I watching? These are questions that we will nvr know the answer to
The fucking expert cant even pronounce "Gouda" right
You can tell which is more expensive easily by looking at them.. Do a blind taste test next.
It’s sad that she spent her life studying cheese
Goat cheese is disgusting
I am not spending $29  to eat moldy cheese
With why does the first expensive cheese got the Irish flag on it
Did she fartet at 1:80
lmao she farted 1:15 hahahahah
1:18
Protein crystals in cheese! Could this be the new method to do x-ray crystallography analysis on proteins?
Lol another scam video desperately trying to justify the existence of a sham profession
“what do you want to be in the future?” a cheese expert
Even an idiot could have seen that, no?
go vegan
Why u say parmigiano reggiano sooo wrong  I'm Italian
Nailed it all of them, cheese real good!
did they take the irish flag for the reggiano in the beginning ?
Cheese expert? That's called: every italian who likes cheese ever.
Can't pronounce parmiggiano reggiano like an italian, THIS IS A SCAM SHEEPLE!!!! SHE'S NOT A PRO SHE JUST DOING GUESS WORK
When did she fart?
That cheese knife I need that cheese knife
what is this bullshit..there is a cheese expert who tries to find out wich is the expensive cheese...but she is allowed to see and not only taste it...im a cheese noob and i can tell by just seeing it which one is the better one..
The thumbnail looks like a put together version of Nicky from Orange is the New Black
I love cheese... Guilty pleasure
I hate the way she pronounces Parmigiano. Parmigiano and Parmesan are two different words. Lol
The spark in her eyes when she said I think I need to taste them.... she is in love!
I’ve guessed all right!😄 Since Iam a cheese lover!🧀🧀🍴😍
that goat cheese looks like coupole
Her eyes are purple
Why does the room look like its for a porn video
Could you please do an A & B of the cheese on your undies (A) after a long day at work (B) after a long work out. I am going with A for a darker yellow more past like pungent smelling cheese over B a wet more milky fresh almost sweet and tangy cheese
Why am I watching this I hate cheese
I don't like the smell and taste of cheese.
Click bait, she can tell by looking at it! Not by taste
Very easy to guess to to look at it
I FOUND A ROTTEN CHEESE INSIDE MY COUCH, THEN I ACCIDENTALLY GOT INTO THIS VIDEO THEN I DECIDED TO SELL IT 2x IT'S PRIZE AND THEY BOUGHT  IT!
"I do know my stuff, no just kidding"   Nah you definitely know ur shit
I really like this type of video! I learned a lot, could it be a series with different foods?
More ugly the cheese more expensive
1. swiss cheese 2. french cheese 3. all the other countries
*"Right off the bat,"*
I love goat cheese lol
Well, the cheese that looks like weirdo is the more expensive one. As in the video
It's not five times more expensive you goon. $20/6oz is a little more than three times as much as $4/4oz or $6/6oz if that makes it more obvious.
Why do people keep talking about fart ?!?!?!? *smh*
I just like a good, smooth, and creamy mozz. I don't like anything else very much. Parm is okay if I have a salad though.
Lol cheese expert
I hate the way Americans say 'Parmesan'
$4/4 oz and $20/6 oz is not 5 x more expensive, more like 3.3 x more expensive
Godamn she actually really knows her stuff. Thank you Epicurious for hiring an expert who actually earns that title vs other channels BS excuse just for entertainment cough Buzzfeed cough.
this is what you need to learn in school
Cheesecake
Cmon guys stop acting like this is the first time you see someone fart. There’s no rule saying you have to tell people when you fart 🙄
"It's like biting into a waxy crayon"
Get yourself a person who nlknows their cheese
this is the worst video i’ve seen in a like a year. all the comparisons are super obvious. any moron would be able to tell which cheese was more expensive just by looking at them. fuck you for making this video. it’s hard to do but i think you made an even worse video than buzzfeed 🖕🏼
I didnt know grace helbing was a cheese expert
She is so sweet!!!
She might want to start taking some classes for pronunciation.
I would like to tell people I am a cheese expert
This video was very *cheesy* Im sorry, was that joke not *gouda* enough for you?
4:02 I’m a nitpicker but it isn’t five times more expensive because 4$ for 4oz and the other is 20$ for 6 oz it is a little more than three times as expensive
I’m supposed to be writing a research paper. What the hell am I doing here
One of the best food videos I’ve seen on youtube.
How exactly does one become a cheese expert?
I just get cheese from luckys
at 1:17-1:25 if you listen closely someone farts.
But can she guess cheap dick cheese from a poor guy vs expensive dick cheese from a rich guy?
Why did they use the flag of Ireland? Italy is red not orange.
Wait. This isn’t buzz feed
Wow she's so well educated.
i dont eat cheese and i still was able to get them al right
Did she say ‘cheese people’
Right she has studied cheese for way too long
Learn a lot today! Wow. Thanks!
I can't eat cheese as I have a nut allergey
I'm impressed! She really knows her cheese!
Alright, recommendations, I'll watch a video about cheese.
4:00 3 1/3 times more expensive*
Government subsidies for CHEESE FARMERS?!?!?... we gotta put a stop to big cheese.
Super sexy AND she likes cheese...she's perfect.
Oh god they exist....
The only cheese I eat that isn't singularly wrapped is Queso Fresco
This video made me want cheese
What specific cheeses were tasted??
3:21 Woman:HEEH HEEH,
Мани ги тея,пробвай българско сирене и тогава ще си говорим!
My dudes what was the cheese that beat Gruyère? I love Gruyère.
Thought it was going to be done blindfolded
I guessed all of them by look without tasting them, pro food tasters are bullshit.
Cut the grind off, let her use her sense of taste.
Try doing it without obvious visual clues...
When you wait for some British cheeses but there isn't any :(
Is she using a french pronouncination for Parmigiano Reggiano? Why?
I hate when people use pretentious ass words like “this cheese is fruity”. Get the fuck out it’s cheese there is no hint for fruit in it. Neither is the goat cheese lemony. It’s sour sure but not lemony smh.
cheese is one of humanity's greatest achievements
Not one french cheese. And you call her a specialist.
She just keeps *cutting the cheese*
How can you tell hum 2 b is better price, for more, if detonator is less
why did i watch 11 minutes of this? and also the uglier the more expensive xD
You don't have to be an expert to tell which of these were more expensive, right? Or is that just me being European?
My nerd ass misread the title as CHESS and came here anyway
What kind of fuck wit would pay $30 a pound for cheese
When did Claire from Modern Family learn about cheese?
Did she study cheese in University?
I came for Camembert and brie
"Cheese expert" bullshit
IT'S BECKY WITH THE GOOD CHEESE!!!!!
Why is the most ugliest cheese or disgusting cheesses are the most expensive??!!!!
So am I a cheese expert because you can clearly tell which is more expensive
I think it's safe to assume that this woman has terrible breath at any given time of the day
When she said “I do know my stuff, no just kidding.” Yet she knew the age, type, origin, process and price of each cheese so if isn’t knowing your stuff I don’t know what is
this was actually so interesting to watch! she's so informative and it was awesome to see how she broke down the information and her recommendations :)
did anyone hear that far at 1:17 ?
Lactose intolerant here... And this was on my recommended feed.
Rind=Expensive
Is this even suppose to be a challenge?
why is this interesting to me
is the B goat cheese actually a brain?
Why did u give her obvious ones.
It's interesting how in America I'm so used to how feta more hard, firm, salty, and crumbly and I didn't think about the fact that people use other milk
it’s almost 1 in the morning and i’m watching a lady taste old cheese. Okay then
So, after you guys shot this video, did you have a cheese and wine party with all of the leftover cheese? Because that's some fantastic looking cheese and it be a shame to waste it all...
I'm just clicking random, intriguing videos now.
I wonder what kind of cheese she is?
why am i watching a video of a women eating cheese...
no such thing as a cheese expert.. same goes for a (wine) expert .... self-given title of rich-egoed losers..
It should of bin a blind taste test
4:25 ``cheese people``
Why does the blue cheese look like a horror film
Cheese expert... I think I missed my calling in life.
I love eating cheese, but the speaker made me appreciate cheese.
I’m so craving cheese now
3:59 Cheese expert =/= math expert apparently.  First is $1/oz and second is $3.34/oz. A quick math lesson tells you that 1 times 5 is not 3.34.
My freind M***an Thorpe loves cheese!
This women loves cheese I guess u can say this is cheesy haha no I'll stop
cheese is good
Her breath hot asl
Good at cheese (not sure you're an expert), but not a match expert.  The goat cheese is not five times more expensive if its 1/2 again as big....
My job is awesome, but this is next level.
how does one become a "cheese expert"?
I would wanna die if my job title was cheese expert
"It smells kinda *NUTTY*"  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Cheese is my kryptonite. I lost so much weight because I banned myself from buying cheese....then when I was at an ideal weight, I lifted the embargo!  Freaking heck, in one year I think I gained over 30 lbs.  At least I know....back to no cheese. It’s already working. I won’t make the same mistake twice. Oh cheese, you are my forbidden love!
Did anyone hear the fart at 1:18
She is faking it
it doesn’t take an expert to be able to figure these out😂
Do I just have to eat a lot of cheese to be considered a cheese expert or is there a cheese school that I can go to?
As a cheese expert myself, I indulge in the specially wrapped cheddar variety. Wrapped in the highest quality aluminum can, the cheezus whizicus is the most delectable and finely aged of cheeses available.
Why would anyone want old crusty hard cheese that’s sat out for over a year
1:18 casually lets out a fart.

Sat here eating a cheese string thinking ....."Hot milf action...i got some cheese you can taste"...plus my doctor says its non-toxic soooo bonus!!!
Mfw I realized I watched a video on cheese. Mfw I found out cheese experts exist
Okay now I want to eat cheese
Got them all correct except for the feta...
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Cheese Expert
parmesan is disgusting
Blindfold her and let her taste them next time.
I didn't think I'd ever see "Cheese expert" in my life
Blue cheese has mold in it.
Well fuck, anyone with the untrained eye can tell which one is older just by judging with how it looks lmao.  1:18 to 1:20 *Fart noise and audible pause* She did fart lmao.
There are cheese experts?
When you live in France and see the cheese prices in the US lmao
I read the title as chinese instead of cheese was confused
I legitimately guessed all of them right, and it looks like being a cheese expert is no big deal.. Meh
4/20 LOL
i call bs on the feta, having salt in your mouth and given the smooth texture is what fake feta is like
They had the Irish flag not Italian on the first
Every B is expensive... maybe i didnt watch the whole vid
Greek feta is the best
There’s no such thing as cheese experts
lol
This lady was awesome, informative and knowledgeable; a real expert, not a faux wannabe.
Welcome to another episode of why is this in my recommended?
Yeah ok I and I think everyone could pick all right just by looking at them.
"I was right" followed  by a chuckle. Time to switch vids.
The perfect woman doesn't exi...
She gives complex and thorough answers as to what things are and why, but the only thing the video actually confirms is the price comparison?? That disappointing.
Even I could tell... This really isn't difficult...
The thumbnail is creepy as fuck
Where do you see yourself in 10 years ?
mother: what would you like to be when youre older?  daughter:  a cheese expert
My next job apparently
Why in the fuck did they make it so obvious you coukd literally tell by looking at them and I'm not a cheese expert
i hate cold cheese tbh but ill eat any cheese thats melted
Wow very informative!! Thanks for the video!
I didn't know that there were many different kinds of cheese??😂😂😂
Her breathe prob always fucking kickin
im a chicken nugget scientist
Why am I watching this? I don’t even like cheese
Ryan Ross where are you?
Boyle from Brooklyn 99 as a woman
I know all the answers but the info is gold 😂😂
yes, a cheese expert. now that’s a career I can pursue
Cheese people
You know what? She really  does know her stuff :-)
ugh....that brainy goat cheese... im sick by looking at it.
How does one make a career as a cheese expert?
Maria.... Thorpe?
Here in Italy cheeses are different!! I buy them in Parma and the colour of for instance parmigiano reggiano is like the ceaper, but has the brownish(but not so muc) rist. Idk
Can you have someone do this with weed?
I have NEVER heard of feta made with cow's milk. That is just not the same thing
hate to smell her breath
Mmm hardened puss. Dairy is disgusting
Her face and body color doesn't mix....?
I fucking love cheese.
Why did I watch the whole video,and why was it my recommended?
You don't need to be a cheese expert so see which cheese is more expensive lol
i read the title as "Chinese experts guesses cheap or expensive cheeses"
Fart at 1:18
I don't like cheese but I assume that if I did I wouldn't want it to be brown and crusty
She maybe a cheese expert but she hasn’t got as much experience as Big Smoke.
Cheese expert.....* slow dramatic nasal inhale * ..............AAAARRRRRRRRRGHHGHHHGHHGJJENENSICHHFHFIEAOOWNR
You can tell just by looking at them... You dont need to be a "cheese expert."
NOOOOOOO....IM A CHESSE EXPERT...😢
She should be blindfolded
they used Ivory Coast's flag to represent Italy  DAfuq
In my opinion aged cheese tastes like shit. Maybe my taste will change bit right now i just eat young gouda or morzarella
I thought that leaf was grape leaf
They should do this again but have another cheese expert choose the two cheeses for every round and the expert from this video  has to figure out which is more expensive.
Cow puss
They don't use the Italian flag next parmigiano origino, they have the Republic of Ireland's flag next to it
Solidified bovine secretions
we have found the whitest woman of all time
Best cheese is Cheddar.
If you're a "Cheese Expert" 1. You have too much time on your hands 2. THAT'S NOT A JOB 3. What are you doing with your life
This is one of the most interesting videos I've ever seen
I dont under stand why rich people like mouldy cheese
I hate cheese
Give her a kraft single
I'm no cheese expert, but I was able to guess every cheese correctly just based on looks. Seems like that is not uncommon based on the comments...
Bruh I was literally able to tell what was more expensive just by looking at them.
Wtf am I doing here watching a cheese expert talk and eat cheese and guess which is more expensive
Cheese is my favorite food like if you agree
How the hell did I go from watching Primitive technology to watching someone eat poor and rich people cheese?
It’s so satisfying
She is the cheese version of a Somm. i love it.
When did I get here
I dunno why I’m watching this when I’m allergic to any type of milk from any animal...☹️
The smeller the cheese the yummier
How fucking desperate are you
Well this video is retarded. Of course a *CHEESE EXPERT* CAN GUESS WHICH IS WHICH!
I was able to tell without tasting, what makes her an expert?
You guys she's not farting. It's the music.
Mild cheese is nice like if u agree
why do people pay more money for something that's equally as healthy and tastes worse.
Legend has it she hasn't shit in years
SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT
This cheese looks like shit, smells like shit, and tastes like shit. MORE EXPENSIVE!
*sMeLls KIndA NuTty*
I bet she farts so much          But so do I so....
It's not a very good test if you don't present them the same way... right off the bat an experienced eye can tell which is which
Me: *eats kraft singles*
I'm no cheese expert but I thought it was pretty obvious which was the most expensive, anyone else?
Who wants to be a cheese expert?!! I mean like who wants to be a cheese expert  barely anyone wants cheese lol XD
"Just kidding" this reminded me of kristen wiig's character in SNL
Wtf is a “cheese” expert haha
She is probably a wine expert to she looks like a stay at home mom
*tastes an exotic cheese once* 0:00
Cacio cavallo potolica is better than all those cheeses.
out of all things... why a cheese expert?!
I like cheesecake. I loVe cheesecake at night
You are just getting this video's content from buzzfeed
Beautiful white woman
They should of blindfolded her!!!! 🤦🏻‍♂️
Yeah those are amino acid crystals. gotta love the experts.
"I'm a cheese expert" well i'm a pizza expert EVEN IF YOU EAT SOMETHING A LOT IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU AN EXPERT
You americans like eating plastic "american" cheese slices what a shame
I'm allergic to cheese
I just have a question: why is handmade better than machine made?  I would imagine machine made to be more precise, what is so special about handmade? all you need is the right process, it doesn't really matter who does the poking holes or who does the packAGING?
1:17 *lol who farted?!?*
why did i watch this
she nailed it. but they should have giver her some curveballs. like human breastmilk cheese, or some donkey cheese lolol
If gordon ramsey turned to a girl and liked cheese and was nice
I myself isn't really a fan of cheeses but I myself can also guess those correctly -.-
I️ could’ve just by look
im not a cheese expert and even i can tell you that the weirder the cheese looks the more expensive
Blue cheese 😷😷😷😷 yuck
I want her job
she cut the nose off, shes not a cheese expert bye
Sweet dreams are made of cheese,  Who am I to diss a Brie? I cheddar the world and the feta cheese Everybody looking for Stilton
Sweet dreams are made of cheese, Who am I to diss a Brie? I cheddar the world and the feta cheese everybody’s looking for Stilton
“Its like a crayon...” uhm no thank you.
I don’t know why but this woman seems so lonely
Ok simple as that! When you see ugly cheese you know that, that is expensive! So when you think someone bought you rotten cheese (well rotten cheese looks ugly but ITS VERY UGLY AND THE SMELL) be grateful that, that person cares for you and they spent their money? I guess?
Why did she fart at 1:18 like was it that old the dust just went straight to her ass
Who gonna pay that much for crusty cheese
damn I wish my girl knew me like this girl knows her cheese.
Am I glad I live in Europe, in the states cheese is very expressive compared to what I'm used to in Amsterdam
I wish someone can read me like she reads cheese.
Can you link to the cheese knife used in the video?
This video is CHEESY!     Sorry, I'll be gone now
Cheese is a fancy food in my opinion
The uglier the cheese the more expensive it is.
Where and how the fuck do you become a cheese expert
It says the dearest one is only made in Italy but it has an Irish flag on the card 2:40
This is the video with the most "Right off the bat" s
I'm a 18 year old boy and i would like to taste your intimate cheese. I have all kinds of skills ; )
This is a little cheeay
18 months?? Yeah I don’t like cheese. Idek how it’s good for you. Looks like there’s mold
she's so awesome
I'm eating cheezits
What brought me here? Seriously? Usually my recommended videos have something to do with previous videos I have watched. So, why was I suggested this? I don’t care about cheese. I couldn’t care less about cheese.
Ever try human cheese?
She seems really into smelling cheese.
I love cheese. 😍
“This isn’t a phase Mom. I just really love cheese!”
fake
89p cheddar at ASDA is just fine mate
"Cheese expert" Call yer da.
this was cool except she kept saying "splurge"
Teacher: what do u want to be when u grow up Me: Cheese expert
"Sit around with your friends and eat this style of cheese" I never invited a friend over for cheese
My dream job
Bad video, visual gives away to much, taste vs taste is better
This was a really awesome and interesting video !
Im Philip and im masturbation expert
Legit thought I was watching Buzzfeed at first
how the fuck is cheese gunna taste fruity to you ...
This was not a very hard test, I know nothing about cheese but I got all of them right
Me talking about pizza
Which one is most expensive A because is way bigger and aged lel
so yea i guessed all of those from just looking and i dont even eat cheese that much.
so much less BS here than wine tasters
If I were her, this would be my thought:  Hmm, there must be a pattern in the answers.
I️ know what I️ wanna be when I️ grow up nos
Buy Local cheese. Don't import.
How could you mix Ireland's flag for Italy's hahah
i dont even eat cheese and this video was fuckin entertaining
4:00 5 times more expensive? It should be 2½ more experience Math
I want to retire on a cheese farm
very interesting i could honestly listen to her talk about cheese all day...and night ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I HATE CHEESE
She needs to have a show.
Cheese expert but still can't pronounce Gouda
"its sticking to my mouth i can barely talk" lol ok.
Goat cheese B is so disgusting looking.
Is it a thing now??   Being a cheese expert seems like nothing to me    No offence
I went into this hoping she would fail. But after this I am super pleased with her, this was amazing. Thank you!
Cheese is fucking gross
1:18  what we learn today: dont eat too many cheese because it causes gas
And to think I was one of those people that never ate cheese. I've tasted some really delicious cheeses lately, My mouth was watering at these.
Goat cheese and milk taste exactly like a goat smells. I feel like the only people that can enjoy goat cheese and milk are the people who've never met a real goat in real life.
Mom, I found my job!
swiss flag was wrong...
now i want cheese
Uggh fuck here we go... A cheese expert, brilliant. This shit is so stupid.
I hate cheese lol
This is quite enjoyable to watch!
I want to eat cheese now..
Why did they use the Irish flag for the Italian cheese?
"Cheese expert"
I only can afford the cheap ones so its easy to me to recognise
Maggot cheese
9:44 is it me or is there a mold paper clip in that cheese XD
It's pretty fucking obvious what one is more expensive
Older cheese = expensive cheese
This vid made me want to be a cheese expert.
that was amazing
Now i know wat im gonna do as an adult
GIVE ME YOUR FUCKING JOB WOMAN
This video was really grate I'm sorry that one was real cheesy.
"It's like eating a crayon with some salt"
omfg im now a cheese expert!!!!!
I could be a cheese expert. If the cheese looks like something you don't wanna eat, it's more expensive
smells n u t t y
She reminds me of my Chem teacher  She's so adorably awkward but knows what she's talking about
No American cheese? Kraft vs Velveeta?
gosh I love feta
It would be better if she was blindfolded even i can tell wich one is expensive
Y’all should make this exact same video. Same lady and everything. But she taste test ass
"I'm thinking an aged gOOOOOOOduh"   ga weg jongen
Im not even a cheese expert and i can tell the difference.
I got all f them right it’s just the one that looks more dry
i dont care about you how about i buy what tastes to me ?
Blindfold or it’s cheating
She looks exactly how I would expect a cheese expert to look
Why am I watching this at 1 AM on a school night? I have no idea.
"Cheese expert uses her extensive knowledge of cheese to tell us the difference between expensive and cheap cheeses" blindfold her while she tastes next time? Will make for an entertaining video as opposed to being told the obvious where it's impossible for her to be wrong.
You should have blindfolded her. I'm not a cheese export (nowhere near), and i got them all right.
I'd any of those idiots realise that the regulated "Italian " cheese had an Irish flag 🇮🇪🙄
everybody stop saying cheese
Right off the bat
This was an easy test I didn’t even have to taste the cheeses to know which ones were which. The only exception was the feta that I guessed right from her description of it but all the others should have been easy for anyone who is into cheese.
my perfect gal
There is a reason why naturally  women love cheese
Better Cheese means that Bacteria Dumped their Excrement longer on that cheese
I don't even like cheese why am I watching this?
Great idea for a video but it's way too easy. Cut from the center or something. Lose the rind. It's cake to pick what is what in this video simply from look!
I have now found the "special party cheese" Hooray! 🎉
This is such an interesting video! Great job!!
I guess I'm also cheese expert
a expert for cheese.....  such a thing??
I should become a chesse expert, all of my assumptions on every chess was right 😋
teacher: what do you want to do when your older? me:
Why are people complaining that she said the cheese was from somewhere else and the flag was different? this wasn't a mistake by the people who set up the cheese, she just assumed it was from a country that it wasn't. she's a blind tester not a psychic
So basically the grosser the cheese, the better the cheese.
This is just as stupid as the price of hookers lets see i could either pay 50 for aids or 100 for herpies. Let it sit there and get gross they will pay double.
Studies cheese and probably makes more than half of the millennials in America will ever make
No u smell nutty Liz
bitch said GOO-DUH. I don't know much about cheese but I know the dutch say it like HOW-DUH, and they made it
was that blue cheese rogue river?
Now I want cheese
Cheese expert > wine expert ?
Wow this girl knows her stuff.
Cheese candy
One of the few "experts" that actually know what they're talking about.
I just watched an entire cheese video...      I’m lactose intolerant.
Yikes, I'm not sure I'd want to eat unpasteurized anything. And why would it be against the law to make a cheese outside of certain parts of Italy? That just seems arbitrary.
Oh cheese its No pun indented.
So where do I study to become a cheese expert?
shit looks gross.
I could tell just by looking lmao
You should of just done a blind taste test, she went off looks instantly.
What do u wanna be when u grow up?  Me:
milf <3
She's the cheese master.
Watching this literally made my mouth water. I was able to guess the more expensive cheese before she even gave her description and guessed the cost of the more expensive cheese within about $4 or $5/lb. and I'm in no way a cheese expert.
Me thinks if she was blindfolded she’d be guessing wrong at least half of the time.
Can we get more info on cheese, cheese lady? :) you made it interesting! Also, now I am craving cheese...
😂 she farted
i only like mozzarella, everything else makes me gag.
Where do I sign up?
Cheese expert? Sign me up
How do i get here
Wait so blue cheese is just cheese with mold inside
Tuesday night $16 vs. Christmas eve $48 price difference cheese? More like Christmas eve $15 vs. 50 year anniversary $48 cheese. That's per pound, so what they're showing for that bleu cheese i would ROUGHLY (very roughly) guess is 3 pounds per bleu comparison. So the actual price for that slice is $150.
At 1:17 did anyone else hear the fart
What parts of the fancy chesses are actually edible
ughhhh why is cheese so disgusting
Imagine going to work always constipated
The cheese that looks grossest and crustiest is more expensive
I’m eating Mac and cheese rn
I wonder if someone in the comments is making cheese puns, but if someone is the puns gotta be to.... *cheesy*
Woa dibs on the hottie cheese expert
How do you become a cheese expert?
*WHEN WILL SHE STOP FARTING*
I dont know much ‘bout cheese, i do love goat cheese though :)
"I think I need to taste it" I THINK I NEED TO ASK YOUUU
Smells *nutty* bit she went ahead ;)
I wish knowing everything about cheese was my job.
People=cheese experts Me=Meme expert
Dang no kraft american singles.
2:25  You put an Irish flag instead of Italian.
More mole = Better Cheese
Summary: The more the rind looks like a dirty old suitcase, the higher the price tag is likely to be.
I thought I was watching Buzzfeed...
i don't need school i'll just be cheese expert
Cheese expert? Her b/o must be horrible!
I bet her feet stink like cheese
easy to tell which cheese cost more LOL
That's a cool set of ,,cheese knifes"  she has there.
Sometimes I wonder what drug the person who wanted to eat old hard milk was on
1:17 listen closely and hear something amasing
This lady knows her shit.
i love cheese
Best 2 cheeses in the world:  Asiago and Stilton.
I HATE cheese but she made it sound good 😂
I guessed them except the fetta 😂 all the gross looking ones are the expensive ones 😂😂😂 🧀
That was very informational! She's very good at explaining the differences to a layperson.
why the hell am i watching this
I love making my own cheese, oh man you need to try my paneer I've mastered the making of paneer cheese
It's not 5 times more expensive!  Expert at cheese yes, expert at math, NO!
me and my girlfriend both guessed all of them but 1, i guess it doesn't take much to be a cheese expert. 2 people who know nothing about cheese guessed 5/6 just by looking at it for a second or two. (we both guess before the "expert" started talking).
All hail the cheese queen!
I never knew cheese could smell and taste like a lot of different kinds of food and such (like olives, fruity etc). I guess I just haven't had much cheese in my life.
Me: goes to store and buys American, Chedder, and Pepper jack 😂  Them: Same dude
Wrong flag on the first cheese!
How do I get paid to be a cheese expert?
7:13 where do I get a knife like that
She got the best job ever.
Parmejiano rejiano. Holy fuck americans just can't pronounce anything.
Ewww the aged goat cheese rind is freakin me out
I wish my name was Thorpe
right off the bat
I recently visited a farmers marked with my mother, and a nice lady asked if we want to test a cheese. My fiancé and I love gruyere and this was what she was offering. But this wasnt like any gruyere I ever tasted, this was a 3 year old one. I thought I am gonna die it was soooo delicious... and 26€ a pound O.o. My mom was like "ah fuck it" and bought a whole pound to share with my fiancé and me. Goddamn we feasted on this for almost 2 weeks, in very little pieces. I am not willing to afford a cheese like this for my everyday life, but I learned that it is ok to spend some money on good cheese from time to time and enjoy with some wine ;-)
I am by no means a cheese expert and I guessed each one right.... maybe I should start calling myself a cheese expert.
Cheep high quality Cheese?
So do you go to school to be a cheese expert? IF YES WHERE DO I SIGN UP
Who new cheese was so interesting
No shit if you give her a whole piece of cheese with the visible rind she can tell which is obviously more labor intensive and aged. Give her a piece of the center.
You call that a cheese expert. Haha. A aged Gouda. Haha. Funny
it looks like shes trying to open her eyes as wide as possible so people wont think shes actually chinese
Youve done so mutch with your life
1:17 anyone heard that fart in the background?:)))
Why has the Parmigiano reggiano the Irish flag? 🇮🇪
How do I get her job?
Am I the only one who thinks those cheeses looked disgusting?
This video just made me want to taste all of those cheeses. I lactose intolerant though :(
How much do they get paid for their jobs?
How is this not buzz feed
The Parmigiano-Reggiano is more expensive because it's bigger.
Hearing her say parmigiano reggiano really hurts my ears as an Italian. Cheese expert maybe but please stop pronouncing parmiagiano reggiano like that.
cough buzzfeed
Such a shame that I don't like cheese :(
Cheese expert, says parmejan smfh lady
I may have accidentally read the title wrong. Chinese expert it was cheese expert so I reread it.
parmejiano rejiano.  experct my ass. learn pronaunciacion idiota
4:09 it’s not 5 times as expensive the prices were per 4 and 6 ounces
Expensive pus v. Cheap pus .... #butisitvegan
Have you considered trying the plant based cheeses? Miyokos Creamery sells aged cashew cheese. It's healthier, better for the environment, and they taste amazing! Just an idea 😀
I've seen too many tv shows about food so I knew which ones were more expensive.
Why did I just spent 11 minutes watching a woman eat cheese?
Anyone else high af
I like the fake stuff.
You dont need to be a fucking expert to tell the difference between  cheap and expensive cheese. What the fuck...
I think its grape leaf
It's pretty easy to tell which one is expensive. Old ugly weird cheese= expensive
her pronunciation of reggiano is quite difficult to listen to, abreviating parmesan to parm, is also not okay, americans dont do food, its true.
To me, cheese is just hardened, gone off milk  Disgusting
I could have told you that shit and I'm vegan
That girl knows her cheese
She looks like Emilia fox
Halloumi cheese is the best
This video whitened my skin
How did I get here. And why was it so interesting that I stayed
Nothing like being asked what you do for a living and saying I’m a cheese expert
Those cheeses are absolutely disgusting.
meanwhile here I am in college using that cheap-ass cheese that comes in the little plastic thing
we in Europe eat a lot of feta cheese  and we have two different names for just feta one name, others cheese
Anyone think she farted at 1:18
Cheese expert cant pronounce parmigiano reggiano 😝
That parmigiano reggiano looked really weird.
I'm curious if her parents are proud of their daughter being a cheese expert
Me at the beginning of the vid: lol cheese boring Me at the end of the vid: I actually think this is malteser cheese because of the round form and brown color It also looks like it's made from cow sheep and goat shit so that's why it tastes so rich i think it costs 1 kidney
I love cheese
Lmao how can you mistake an Ireland flag with the Italian flag @ 2:24 . Made me put up the brightness on my laptop just to be sure.
The more expensive the cheese the more inconvenient it is to eat.
Aww i was wrong on the feta cheese but i thought i’d make more mistakes lol i love how this woman talks about cheese. I actually watched this whole vid until the end... That’s a new record for me. Here’s a Like from me and thanks for the lesson on cheese! ;-)
I could recognize Greek feta from a mile away, I have it every day! Also that is the best job ever, I love cheese!
She kinda looks like Liz Forbes from Vampire Diaries
Just let a dutch person ( like me 😊) do this we will get it right just by looking at it😂
This was impressive to watch!
I just get those square thin American cheese
id let her taste my cheese if you know what i mean :>
I wouldn't trust a wine or alcohol expert but cheese this is another thing in it's entirety, her background knowledge alone proves her experience compared to sommelier that just uses pretentious language and words to enact a sort of prestige.
So are cheese flavor profiles as bullshit as wine ones? I'm more willing to buy into the cheese ones because at least they arent all made of the same ingredient in nearly the same process.
This one is five times more expensive if you do not compare weight
Btw its not Mantua but Mantova!
Wow sounds like a wine snob just spewing bullshit about the 100 different flavours they can taste in one bite
Yes girl you do know ur stuff
Cheese is cheese, I don't need to be an expert to say it's good
Now your definitely going to want to go with the Craft cheese over the more expensive one.
She THINKS she had to take a taste test because she WANTS to eat cheese xD
shes a cheese expert yet she cant pronounce Gouda
Im lactose intolerant
The first Parmigiano Reggiano is really dark and hard, so it was badly conderved.
1:18 did she just farted
Is anyone else triggered by the way she cuts waaay to much cheese but actually eats teeny tiny bites??? 😣💔
listen to this with your eyes closed xD
Switzerland is not part of the EU...
i love feta cheese 😍
Protein crystals? I thought it was salt..
Switzerland isn't EU country. Ignorant American
Well i would have guessed them too  , and i don't know cheese..
She farts a lot. But she’s lovely. So that’s ok.
JUST SPLURGE ALREADY
The only thing I learned from this is how fcking many different cheese knives there are
She pronounced gouda wrong haha oh wow.
I need to know where you got that goat cheese (A) because I never heard of goat cheese with no smell
Parmijiano rejiano
Teacher: What do you want to be when you grow up? Me:     A cheese expert.
This video is cheesy
“In blue cheese you put mold in to give it flavor”  Oh, and this is why I hate blue cheese :D
This is cringe and cancer at the same time
What a dream job. I'm basically doing the same thing but I don't get paid 🤔
Gentlemen, don your white hats ;)
I am hungry
cancer
>Cheese Expert >Doesn't know how to pronounce Parmigiano Reggiano
My dick cheese is very aged and rare, only one producer in the world
do more videos like this where we learn concepts/theory rather than recipes! thanks!
She kinda looks like a cheese (compliment)
does guessing right makes me an expert?cheap ones look cheap. that's it.
Do a blind taste test now to determine which cheese is actually better, not just which one is more expensive. Also with more than two cheeses per category. Put them in order of best to worst based on taste alone and see if that aligns with the price.
Wow, Teri Hatcher knows her stuff
My dream job
'Im Frank and im a leaf expert' Frank probaly earns more than you each year. What a world this is.
"My wife is such a dork. She's a cheese expert. "
Watching this made me feel like a cheese expert 😂
isn't it so easy? i mean like if it's more elaborated it's obviously more expensive, right?
She can try my cheese stick lmao
At 2:25 it's an Irish flag not Italian
What a cheesy video.
In the last pairing, what was the leaf-wrapped cheese?  I am thinking it was some sort of Valdeon or Cabrales.  Is it available in NYC area?
My dream job
Take it cheezy girl
Cheese Expert. Pronounces Gouda wrong....
Did she learned this in college?
http://YouthJobz.com/?refer=28580
Actually an excellent video! This kind of expertise is so interesting and it was incredibly well put across.
i dont like cheese...im more on peanut butter...
Hi Cheese expert lady, will you marry me?
Blue cheese has mold in it.
You don't like cheese but you still press on this video. What's wrong with you #-#
So the uglier the cheese the More expensive it Will be ?
I wonder what the day in the life of work is like for a Cheese Expert.
I love how she want's everyone to buy small farm local-American made..... She needs her fancy cheese at a lower price...  LOL More people buying the lower the cost can be!
OMG  ha ha ha "it has this really Strong fruity smell"='s her "that stinks" face 9:53
Are her eyes violet? :O
wow rigged, joking! :D
@2:23 You used the Irish flag for the Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano.
4:01 no because it’s 20/6 and 4/4 different ratio not 5 times more expensivd
I guessed all of them correct      Am I a cheese expert yet?
4:00 it is not 5 times more expensive. As you can see A is $4/4oz and B is $20/6oz. $20 divided by 6oz = $3.3333.../oz. $4 divided by 4oz = $1/oz. It is actually 3.3333... times more expensive. Not 5.
I wish I could afford those fancy cheeses
This is a fascinating video. I love cheese.
I dont get why people take cheeses this seriously. I guess its just a "Im more sophisticated than you" thing
I'm not a cheese expert at all, but it wasn't that hard to tell which is the more expensive one. Also does anyone noticed that she took bites from the SAME feta cheese @7:12 ?? They don't even try to make this look not fake..
After watching this I kinda craved for cheese lol
Doesn’t take a genius to guess this shit 😒
Whwre is maggot cheese?
I'm really interested in this type of profession. I wanna be a wine expert . How do you become one. im so amazed of the information she shared. THANK YOU
Liz... i want to be your student.  Learn me in the ways of cheese.
She bought the cheeses before shooting the video. That’s what I think is going on.
Interesting. But: They should have done one more challenging test where she's blindfolded. A LOT of information is visual and it's cool to see how much more even experts struggle when they have to rely only on taste :)
if one cheese is 4$/4oz and the other is 20$/6oz, the first one is not 5 times cheaper, it's only 3.33 times cheaper. Go back to school, you suck at math.
I bet she tastes her own cheese
I learned something
Sadly, the one on the left doesn't even look like Parmigiano Reggiano. I'ts surely not authentic as she claims.
"five times more expensive" check again
i bet she stays constipated
What the fuck why am I watching this lmao
how do you go about becoming a cheese expert 😂
Why does she cut such large slices but only take a little bite 😭😭😭😭😭
Dude. I literally guessed just based on looks and got them all right. Have her do a blind taste test for god's sake. This proved nothing.
Nastier older expired ugly cheese is the most expensive so who wants to start a rotten cheese business.? We'll put a price of $10000 so celebs can buy lol
THE VEGANS ARE SCREAMING
I want her job
pretty sure she farted @1:17
IM HUNGRY 😑
I thought she'd be like a pretentious wine expert but I was pleasantly surprised
When they use the Irish flag instead of the Italian flag for the parmigiano reggiano
Blind fold!!! No shit a cheese expert will be able to tell with their eyes smh
Well right off the bat
Wheres charlie kelly
your shits must REEK lady
Now I know a lot of cheese facts, cheese experts are cool XD
For 20 cents I can get a motzeralla stick sooooooooooooooooo🧐🧐🧐
Feed her Kraft singles!
Feta is terrible when it's cheap. Cheap brie and camembert and different and worse than their expensive counterparts but are good in their own way.
This was honestly so relaxing
Imagine having this level of immediate knowledge on any subject.
Constipation is a real and ever-present threat.
would you like to taste my homemade cheese. i can tell this cheese is Hand made too
The only cheese I'll eat is you because it smells like onions, fish, and pennies hmmmmmmm very preserved
We have to stop white people...
Ahaha, I didn't know the knife looked like a cheese until I rewatched this Cx
I never watch videos like this but I actually enjoyed this.
My favorite part is that she doesn't make her decision until after tasting them. Like she doesn't say "just by looking at them i can tell A is the more expensive one"
some real softballs guys, sheesh
This is dumb.  Showing the coulor and rind of the cheese gives it away!  Should have been a blind taste test. SAD!
I hate blue cheese
her breath probably stinks now
she's cool
i bet shes constipated
You don’t have to be a cheese expert to know the difference in these cheese. I would think anyone who cooks would know the stuff she talks about
This' bitches breathe must staaaaaaaank
Love you cheese lady!
Fucking cheese expert? I bet your parents are proud.
Liz is delightful! Thanks for sharing your cheese wisdom.
I just watched an eleven minute video of a woman eating cheese. Time to revaluate my life.
imagine how constipated she gets
How about dickcheese?
Ok i REALLY love cheese but not this much
What do you call cheese that doesn't belong to you?....      Nacho cheese :)
Me gusta el queso chafa :V igual no tengo dinero para gastar en queso fino xD
A blind tasting would have made sense. Visually it was way too easy.
nice blade though
Totally love this. I actually learned a lot of cool little facts and I love cheese as well.
I dont k ow why im watching this im super alleric to dairy products
I got them all right so I think being a cheese expert is useless
she low key not even that bad lookin
I think I know what I want to do when I grow up
It must be hard keeping your figure eating all that cheese.
1:11 she is a marine now
fresh goat cheese is so fuking good as a replacement of mozzarella on bruschetta. im italian and trust me on this! or put both......... man.......
I love cheese but damn i never knew how complex the cheese world was lmao i guess it’s just one of things you just don’t really think about until ya know. You live and you learn!!
Wanna hear a joke?    Nvm it'd be too *cheesy*        see what i did there
i love cheez
I love her can she teach a class in cheese at my school please
You want some cheese with that wine?
I got them all right just by staring at the cheese
Love this vid, she's super personable, and talked like a friend who's a cheese expert, not like a cheese expert tryin to sell you on hype
She cut the cheese 😜
I enjoyed all the insight into the cheeses but you probably didn't need an expert to tell which was most expensive, enjoyed none the less.
But can you cut the cheese?
It is 11:40pm on a school night. Why am I here
So right off the bat...
The goat cheese was not five times more expensive. Bitch can't do math
My dream job
Should have blindfolded her
Why am I watching this?  I HATE CHEESE!
She’s so down to earth. Please bring her back. She’s great and super informative! I love that she gave examples where each cheese at each price point would shine.
We eat lots of Feta Cheese in Honduras
As a cheese maker this is really interesting. Mostly the comment section lol
This is making me crave cheese 😍
i thought this would go down like a wine expert unknowingly tasting and assessing cheap wines
I'd love to see this again but with the specialist blindfolded!  There were a lot of visual clues to which was more expensive.  Taste was a big difference too, but it'd be cool to see the breakdown and comparison without the visuals.
I like cheese...but the processed and sliced, stringy pizza stuff
To save time. Old looking cheese is more expensive
She cut the cheese
I really like her personality (:
Milk is disgusting
How does one become a cheese expert?
This video is cheesy
Professional Cheese Expert: Living proof dreams can come true.
Informative and interesting video! I loved it! Thanks for sharing!
This is actually very impressive
ok she HIT us with those facts.. i expected it to be like “its expensive bc its ugly” but she had the figures
I love 🧀
Blue Cheese has MOLD IN IT!
I'm vegan. Why am I watching this? Haha! Watching someone show off their weird skills is so interesting lol.
uhhh does she fart and keeps on talking like it never happened??
this is so easy as someone who is French. Legit nothing special, I do respect how much she knows about the process though
The grosser the cheese looks the more expensive
Please do more of these food expert videos!!
I got all of them right except for the feta cheese.
R i g h t   O f f   T h e   B a t
Now do mushrooms or something else
Fake and gay
World's most constipated lady 0_0
too much queso @ 1:16
I just watched a ten minute video of someone talkin about cheese. The weird thing is, I was entertained.
She know her stuff well...    heyyo im actually a slacking expert.. you can invite me aswell
Mc chicken
Blinded test or GTFO.
Just look at the one that looks gross and that's probably more expensive
But what are they?! We need to know!
1:18  Anyone else hearing that?
I bet her farts are the worst.
why the hell would you want to be a cheese expert? seriously, why?
Why am I watching this? What has my life come to? 😂🤔
they should have given her a cheeto and some spray can cheese to say which is better
I like to consider myself a cheese advocate, but this video was so interesting and educational
So pretty much the uglier the cheese the more expensive it is 😂😂
Very informative and interesting.
Guuuuurl that fromage a raclette was not gruyère, no fucking way
How do I apply for this job
She’s legit!
I really really REALLY want cheese right now. But I want the expensive kind how i hate being broke
Plag is a cheese expert
Now i want cheese
This woman really likes cheese.
It's pronounced , par meh gee ahh no rejanoe Cheese expert my ass
She must get constipated a lot haha
Now i want some cheese
opens fan *Thorpe*
Alright what the fuck am I doing here, I got hw to do
I actually really like how she lists the positive uses for both cheeses, and that she actually explains the cheese making process that contributes to the flavor and outcome.
4:00 "5x more expensive". Cheese expert- not math expert.
I want cheese now
Wait a minute. This isn't buzzfeed.
As a French I like this video and it was so easy for me to guess just by seeing it haha
I feel like a cheese expert now, she should do classes
Anyone can be a cheese expert just pick the one that looks least appetizing
Sadukochunge
Honestly its easy. All it takes is uh, trying real cheese once in your life
Impressive.
19 +19 — — —   38  Not 25...
Great expert! Smart and knowledgeable without sounding condescending. Does she have an audiobook? Lol
Lol tbh i tought this vid was from BuzzFeed, typically a buzzfeed and inlove them so ill subscribe
1:18 there's a fart
It is really satisfying seeing a professional who really knows their stuff and seems dedicated to it.
I should really go to bed now
She had to brush her teeth 3 times after this
she’s an expert in fermented cows milk..
A video where the expert actually knows stuff and It's not Just a moron getting free food? That's a first.
I hate cheese 😰😷
I thought I love cheese until I saw this video. She outshines my mere affiliation for cheese
I bet I’m not the only one wanting her to fuck up
Par- me -ja -no   Ra-ja-no  that’s how u pronounce it for non Italians
This was a cheesy video
1:18 she farted
I just buy plain cheese from store.
Some people are going to hate me for this but I find American cheeses lower quality. Also, how the hell can it be feta if it's made from cow's milk. A total imposter. I'd feel cheated if I bought that.
I thought she was Kate McKinnon in the thumbnail.
I love cheese 😍 🧀
You cheddar believe that this was an informative video.   Cheesus Christ, that was a bad joke.  Just joking, these are pretty grate.   The rind won't ever stop.   You might as well kick me to the curd, for that one.  Alright, I'll stop. These jokes are way too cheesy.   *I'll brie here all night.*
this my calling, where do I sign up
How does one become a cheese expert?
A cheese expert who can't pronounce Gouda properly...?
Got all of them right.
Bruh I want this JOB
1:17 who farted?
Me when I pass the cheese isle
A "Cheese Expert"
How can she eat a big piece of cheese😱
I hate cheese (no hate) every I see it I just think:  this is aged milk
I hate cheese but I REALLY hate crunchy cheese
I've got plenty of under cheese for her tbh.
You have to be dumb if you don't understand that all melted cheese, sliced melted cheese are cheapest and most harmful in the world, because they are made of left overs and trash ingredient. Never give Sliced melted cheese that mc donalds and others fast food companies use, they decreases child's IQ Significantly and you all should read what is hydrogenated fats
Am I the only one who can't stand cheese.   Like a cheese stick or on pizza or mac and cheese its good, but by itself, it's disgusting.  It's too salty, and nasty.
She did really well....👍👍
The second is only 3.33x more expensive rather than the 5x she says... this is basic math people.
I want to be a cheese expert
The fact that you called her a cheese "expert" and not a cheese "whiz" is a real disappointment .
Rogue River Blue?
Cheeses fucking christ...
why am i watching this
Not even gonna name drop the creameries/farmsteads that make them...
i want that job
This is so fake and set up so she can promote herself. Ugly
The price revealing got me nervous because I️ want her to get each one right lol she’s an expert!
N mm.  N n n n.  N n.  N n. N m.  Mm.  Mm. N.
Mom: what do you wanna be when you grow up Her: a cheese expert. Mom: ooooookkkkkayyyyyy, I’m gonna go now...
Didnt know the good old parmesan comes from Ireland. C'mon guys ist just a google search away to find out the right Italy flag :)
RIND   NIGGAAAA
RIND
i thought she would guess without seeing the cheese... even i can guess which one is more expensive just by choosing the most weird looking one
I actually really enjoyed this video and I think Liz is so well educated on her cheeses and I'd definitely would watch her again for more cheese videos!
I love that this isn't just entertainment, it is learning! The more you know
I was hoping that she would be wrong... but it was still fun.
This was actually REALLY interesting... you should do this with more experts in other areas of food... the explanations were just awesome, I loved learning more about the cheeses even though I'm not a particularly big fan of cheese in general.
The darker cheese was more expensive every time.  No curveballs here.
I guessed them all right, not because I stuff about cheese but you can tell by the looks. The expensive one looks better, i mean look at the blue cheese, the one with the wraps and fancy stuff is obviously the expensive one. They should've done this blindfolded and see then. Crappy video.
This was NOT a hard challenge 😒
You know its expensive when its "Fruity"
At first I was like “ha yeah o k a y cheese expert” but I’m left extremely impressed
Truffle briat savarin is the best cheese ever made by human kind
dariy is disgusting
Ah, but can she tell the difference between knob cheese and toe nail cheese?
Don't like any parmesian.. I was able to tell the difference by looking at each, on camera..
Cheese is a horrible food. Unethical, waste of grains and waters(to feed the cows, and to produce the cheese blocks). Everyone should at least look into veganism, look at legit sources. Anyone who claims to love Science and wants to be healthy, and/or save the planet NEEDS to go vegan! Look it up guys! It might(definitely) will change your life!
Very interesting! Chick your skin is phenomenal too!
It’s 2AM, why am I here
this lady is super cool, i love the way she explains things
I’m lactose intolerant
Cheese Expert my ass anyone can do that.
"I really do know my stuff"... "just kidding" Women: stop belittling yourself like this. Yes you DO know your stuff, be proud of it.
this is very intimidating
I figured them all out except for the feta. Her explanations and knowledge was awesome.
Aged cheese is allways more expensive
BuzzFeed how is that not you?
Shit I am cheese expert.
she's pretty, and i like the way she talks. if more teachers like her in this world, man, no one will ever skip classes again
I loved this everything about this video
Great video. I want to be a cheese expert. I love cheese !!
If she thought that the left parmigiano was Gouda, then she is not an expert..
For a European, what is better is expensive. For an American what is expensive is better.
Cheese is an Opioid.
that aged goat cheese looks ugly and stylish at the same time
Ahh yes some good old parmigiano reggiano from Ireland LOL
quick question: how do i get to be a cheese expert?
discusting!
I'm a Dildo Expert
I don’t need to be an expert to guess which one is more expensive😂
That was super interesting and now I'm super hungry, thank you! I guessed right for everything except the feta, since I don't consume that that much.
You should do this but with prosciutto  and chorizo!
so jealous, i want to eat them all. love this woman tho
Gee, she gets to look at them and just go with the obviously less factory-made-looking one? I'd need to see her quickly and reliably distinguish otherwise identical *dishes* made with more and less expensive versions of cheese.
Did she fart at 1:18 ??
I told myself to imagine it was lard. That worked for a year. I've been eating it again for a 10yrs. I just got older and gained about 10 lbs.
Who else would bang the cheese expert?
Amy Adams. It's all I can see.
B feta is real Greek feta and mind her facial expression when she taste it. Feta A is the one that you can find in markets often and I personally don’t like it.  And that Parmigiano Reggiano is just crying for a glass of white wine
This bitch obviously didn't go to math class because she said that the 20 $ cheese was 5 x as much as the 5 $ cheese but it is 4x as much.
I managed to figure out all of them correctly
she talks too much
Wonder how upset she'd get if she suddenly became lactose intolerant?
A) Why B) its pretty obvious from looking and also the 2nd cheese is 3.3 times more expensive ...
I Love her voice...It makes me interested on whatever she is talking about...
What do you do for living  I taste cheese Ohhh kay
A cheese expert would be an European not an American
The new buzzfeed ?
Boring.
PHIL LESTER! 😂
I think i found my future career
She is s well informed and smart! Super humbled by this video
Mom: GET OFF UR PHONE Me: Chill, I'm watching an educational video that can help me become what I want to be In the future.
i hate cheese...why im watching this ?!?!?!?!?
You know, good quality real feta cheese in Greece isn't supposed to look like that, smooth and creamy. Your knowledge is very standard
What do you want to be as an adult?  Kid:I want to be a cheese expert!  Cheese experts aren’t rea- Kid:*plays this video*
I really enjoyed this video because it had an in depth explanation of her reasoning and gave us extra info about each cheese
Lol when your momma is a cheese expert and she sees cheese in the mall she's gonna rip and taste rich one is better than any normal people do to it 😂😂😂 damn it make sense when I said it
I don't actually look at the cheese but i look at the knife. And i want that cheese looking knife
if only this video had not a strong American accent. #thumbsdown
shes actually good wow
DID SHE JSUT FART FROM 1:10 TO 10:21 SOMEWERE INBETWEN THERE ???
should be blindfolded
Beautiful eyes, and great knowledge
Why have i just watched someone identify cheese for eleven minutes?
*Vomits*
I'm not about to read the thousands of comments before this, but am I right in guessing that the the winning "Alpine style” cheese was Pleasant Ridge Reserve?
she probably has really bad shiT lmao
Me luv cheese.  Very informative video. :D
I am not a cheese expert and i got every single one right...
It was really educational, but... Where is the French cheese?????
5 times its 4oz and 6oz
get the mistake at 4:02
It’s obvious af
What tf is cheese candy
I got all but one right. I just guessed which one looked the oldest and I was right almost all of the time.
Older cheese =More expensive shit! Gaah why even one has to be a cheese expert to know that. I can tell the difference even if I had a blindfold on me.
Excellent how she isnt all elitist about the more expensive cheeses. She appreciates cheese for what it can give you. Amazing!
Would be really interesting if she guessed first then spoke about them because its easy just but look to tell which is more expensive
Who else heard that fart at 1:19
I a m a c h e e s e
lol i dont have to be expert to guess a is more expensive, ones moldy one looks like plastic
Thought this was going to be some pretentious shit but it was actually good.
What do you wanna be when you grow up...?
I love this lady! She is super informed and I feel really enlightened watching this! Thanks for the upload!
this gave me lactose intolerant
"Cheese expert"
Well duh...you can look and see the better cheese.
2:27  Was cheese A from Ireland? I thought it had to come from Italy? If so, why was the Irish Flag used?
I just looked at which looked older lol and i got all of them right.
I don't think Claire Duncan is actually a cheese expert.
I don't think Claire Duncan is actually a cheese expert.
This would be bad for lactose intolerant people
Is it really necessary to take off such huge chunks... O.O
Right off the bat
Best know I'll be at my next party talking about cheese with all my newfound knowledge lmao .
Whenever I watch these things I always wonder "how the fuck did they become an expert of this shit?"
MILF ;)
Damn she's good
She knows her stuff. I guess u could say she’s a “gouda” cheese expert 💀
How is this even a challenge for her when she can see them and she's an expert so she knows what to look for, a better challenge would have her do a blind tasting
This whole video all I can think about is how are we supposed to know which mold can be eaten or not 🤔
I enjoyed all of the information, but this was a little bit like asking which the more expensive wine is, when you serve it in the bottle.
Mmmm......cheese heaven.
The oddest thing. I went into Price Chopper the other day and saw so many different cheeses...all I wanted to do was sample them all, or steal a wheel of a kind for myself. I held back and bought bread instead.
1K people hated on cheese.
waww .. niceee.. love this video..
I don't eat cheese very often but when I do I prefer grass fed. Stay cheesy my friends.
All you sub to my channel  :) just because :)
Interesting concept but super obvious
"I'm gonna have to try them!" That's my excuse too whenever they have free samples at the supermarket...
Cheese expert? Must be a human mouse or something
More useful information than algebra and calculus combined
4:03 10/3 times more expensive*
Wow, what’s next, Minecraft Expert?
i hate cheese
I'm lactose intolerant but this was fascinating! And Liz is really impressive! Wow!
there is no guessing, the looks gave obviously gave it away every single time
7:25 and 7:33 is the same scene? That is piss poor editing...I can't even tell which one she tasted first. Because she doesn't refer to A or B rather "this one". I am assuming she tasted B first and then editing inserted cut scenes of A so that she cut both at the same time. She looks at her right after saying salty crumbs which I assume is A I guess...So I guess A is the one she likes as black olives. Also since she made the recommendation to purchase the expensive one.   Overall she is amazing and this is very educational.
Did anybody realise that around 3:22 there was a giggling sound like someone was laughing sneakily?
Welp she isnt lactose intolerant 😂😐
I like this lady.
That was a religious experience.
Cheese.... my weakness
this made me feel like an expert on cheese now
1:18 THIS BITCH JUST FART?
i wanna eat a woman's breastmilk made into cheese.
I wish my cat loved me as much as she loves cheese
exuse me why am i not a cheese expert !
I hate cheese.. unless it's Nacho cheese on chips, Mozzarella on pizza or Cheddar in a burger.. Lol.
Thats cheating even if i saw the look of them id know.
Why am I watching this
It's so sad to see all the cheeses with wine, crackers, their "exquisite" flavors.  Because I hate cheese.  If it ain't mozzarella or parmesan, it's a nope for me.
Shoulda given her some fromunda
Her breath must be fucking horrible
Lmao this channel is a buzzfeed wannabe
I'm from Wisconsin and anyone from Wisconsin is a cheese expert. So. Yeah
She makes it gross
God that expensive blue is arousing
*Woah I thought this was buzz feed*
I got a Dairy Good add befor this video started
i don’t know why, but i read chinese expert
Am i the only one wondering why  tf there is such thing as a “cheese expert” ?
A girl like that doesn't spit.  My type of girl.  Yet the fat will get to her!
Does mean we're all cheese experts since they're so obvious? I straight away lmao, and I bet everyone else did too
She has a cheese knife Im SHOOK
anyone else feels like a cheese expert after watching this?
Bet her breath smells bad
Gouda is gooda.
"cheese expert" i learn new things everyday. And i thanks Youtube for it
@4:05 it's 3 and 1/3 times more expensive, how was she that far off?!
I clicked on this video because her eyes look purple ???
Her fart must stank
Who grows up deciding, "oh I want to be a cheese expert!". (Family talking about child who grows up to be a cheese expert) ever since she was little she just loved cheese! 🧀
“BLUE CHEESE HAS MOLD IN IT!”
aged guuda/gooda whats this?
i don’t understand why i am watching this at 4 am with a statistics exam in 3 hours
The only cheese expert I know is Charlie Kelly
I thought the title said chess expert
I thought a cheese expert would know how to properly pronounce 'gouda'.  I guess not, haha.
Who else thought this was buzzed tasty😂
Mozzarella?
I know this is out of topic, but I now have a crush on her. She is so gorgeous omg
But like, what qualifies one to be a cheese “expert”?
Rotten milk expert
Why am I watching this
PLZ DO A PART2 WITH BRIE
4:25 "Cheese people"?? What the hell is going on here?
the boondocks taught me i can befriend white people by offering them cheese, is this true?
I've learned more about cheese watching this video then I ever hoped to learn in my life.
wow she's really good but  i just wish i could eat cheese !!
1:19 was that a fart?
That’s a great knife
Who would fucking eat that green shit
You should make her test Norvegia! Best cheese in the world!
She has the best job. How do you become a cheese professional!?
i thought she was saying "parmigian  oreggiano"  haha guess i dont know cheese
I wanna be that good at something
Anyone heard the sound at 1:18
Now do wine experts!
Who's the idiot who decided to give price comparisons for different amounts of cheese (re: the goat cheeses)?
This definitely helped me understand why cheeses cost different prices and why it's so important to buy the more expensive cheeses especially here in America. I've only recently begun to enjoy cheeses and this helped out alot!
Anybody else confused as to why they watched this whole video?
She’s so good
Darker = Expensive (Am I employed now? ;-; )
https://youtu.be/cWDdd5KKhts
Doesn't it give it away (mostly) to see the cheese?  Kind of a predictable and pointless video.
This seems like a very useless job haha. Aged= more expensive. Wow so hard
wow i feel like a pro too
she ROASTED that feta
I love this lol
She went to cooking school and majored in cheese, lol.
damn, she actually gave really good insights and she wasnt obnoxious or annoying! yeyy haha
Pure talent!
What am I doing with my life right now
I don’t even like cheese but I could listen to her talk about cheese all day as a choice of procrastinate
I thought mold was bad to consume ?
What am I doing here. I don't even eat cheese
Cheese is literally just old cow puss with enzymes in it.
I never knew being a cheese expert was a career choice. That's my dream job. Eat cheese all day.
She juss want the cheese
Neither of the cheeses are cheap.
This is one of those binge watching 3am kind of videos
Wait...    This is not BuzzFeed. 😐
Honestly this is was so interesting.
Eat the whole pieces you cut!!!!
do more like this!!
I want to be a cheese expert
i want cheese now. anyone else?
this honestly seems easier the smellier and uglier and nastier it is the more expensive it is
Parmigiano Reggiano is the shit.
4:12 it's not 5 times more expensive
Any food that has the word "american" before it sounds artificial
Five times more expensive? Goat cheese A was $1/oz. Goat cheese B was $3.33/oz. It’s a little over 3 times more expensive.
Very informative and entertaining video! Learning what makes one cheese more expensive and the differences between them was fun. :)
Yall be criticizing the cheese expert and i'm here like "Wow, I learned something about cheeses in one video."
I thought this was buzzfeed..
This is the most cheesiest video I’ve watched today🙄
I really enjoyed this, but just watching this video is giving me diarrhea.
I'm a pussy expert: guessing types by my tongue
Fuck im hungry and i want cheese
What qualifications do you need to become a "cheese expert?"
The first cheese prices has the Irish flag on it, not the Italian flag
1:18 Did someone crack a fart?
I guessed every one of them correct except for the feta, does this mean I'm a valid cheese expert? Wheres my badge? lol
I like the video and she's very impressive and likeable
the fuck?  wheres the C H E D D A R and M O Z Z A R E L L A?
This would have been a lot more interesting if almost all of them hadn't been blatantly obvious.
*is a vegan but watches anyway*
why am i watching this. i hate cheese
Damn I’m impressed
Her eyes are purple???!?!?? Alexandria syndrome???!??
A video about cheese without Dutch cheese?!?!?!?!
No one can make feta than the greek one.And yeah im from greece
She is really enjoyable. She needs a cheese show on PBS. She had a total hard on for that last one!
i thought this was gonna be lame but damn she's so smart like wow she was giving so many details and i was like how does she even know this stuff idk she's wild i love it tho
i am no cheese expert but i could easily tell which was more expensive....the info was the interesting part
Did she actually fart at 1:17 🤣🤣🤣
This is really interesting for some weird way, love it ♥
how do people eat huge chunks of cheese like that? it's too much. i can only eat like a third of a dime size of cheese at a time or i'll vomit but i LOVE cheese
I love feta so much
1:17 did she just fart while cutting the cheese lol
Cheese is really bad for you and is a very cruel product. Do better people!
This was really informative for me as a cheese ignorant person so thanks
Not a single french chees...
I enjoyed this so much and I don't even like cheese
I don’t even like cheese. Why am I watching this?
Anyone hear that fart or something lol
Anyone think she's sexy af?
Cheese is disgusting
CONCLUSION:  Young cheese = cheap cheese
This was easy af man I eat kraft cheese at home and I could tell the difference lmao
I have feeling she has a problem pooping sometimes
LOL the way „cheese experts“ are a thing in the US. Swiss/Dutch people could sense the differences from Miles away. Even germans.
Why the fuck am I watching this
I couldve gotten them alk right by just looking at them
the nastier it is, the more expensive
Very informative.
Why the hell is she talking about " Brie " when it's goat cheese though ? Brie is from cow milk ...
I finaly found the purpece of that weird looking knive we have
obviouuuus
She's humble and likeable. And this video was very educational, loved it !
what am I doing here... im vegan
At 2:24 You guys used the Irish flag instead of the Italian flag! Get it together @Epicurious!!
Say cheese, expert!
I ain't no damn cheese expert and I guessed all of them right
I wish they did brie
buzzfeed ran out of ide.. no wait..
She didn't look closely at the labels on the goat cheese.  4 oz vs 6 oz.  The more expensive one isn't five times more expensive.   It's only 3.33 times more expensive.
well I guess I don't have to wonder about my career choice
I HATE CHEESE!
What a math fail. Goat cheese cheap one is per 4 oz and the expensive one is per 6 oz. $20 / 6 oz = $13,33 / 4 oz. Which makes it still more expensive, but actually more ~3 times instead of 5 times more.  Either you try to make the expensive one look more expensive, or you failed on so many points in making this video, that I can't really believe it.
what am i doing here ?
When I grow up I want to be a cheese expert
I was just watching a random video cause I was bored but that was very informative
who else thought it was buzzfeed?
how do you become a cheese expert I'm asking for a friend
There's one mistake...Switzerland isn't even part of the EU
I had no idea cheese experts existed
This chick is a cheese Genius. Some would say "Cheenius".
cheese,and other foods, in the usa are twice as expensive as parts in the uk.
at 1:18 someone farted
Seriously... Guessing the more expensive cheese was super easy, I figured it would actually be a challenge but this is something a 5th grader could just guess on. To make it more of a challenge, they should have put two very expensive cheeses together... Rather than an obviously cheaper cheese, and a super expensive cheese side by side.
basically whichever one is uglier is more expensive.
consumer expert guesses which youtube video is actually a paid ads | this one is
Ewww fucking mold on cheese
My lactose intolerant body cannot comprehend this
Kind of lame to compare aged cheese vs non-aged.....
I want her job wtf
anyone else notice they had the Irish flag instead of the Italian flag in the beginning?
Self-pronounced Cheese Expert - mispronounces "Gouda"
This bitch could've been an expert in anything and she picked moldy cow milk
WHAT , they add mold to the cheese??? D:
Gotta say this is a rather... cheesy video.
oooooh yeeeeah
Is nobody gonna bring up that her eyes look kind of purple?
I’m lactose intolerant but “cheese expert” sounds like my dream title
My kind of woman
I live in Parma and here Parmiggiano Reggiano is our pride along with Parma's Ham
The cheese expert doesn't know how to count. The second cheese comparison she said cheese A, which is  is $4 for 4 oz, and cheese B is $20 for 6 oz. Then she said cheese A is 5 times more expensive than cheese B. If you do the math, its 3.333 times more expensive, not 5. Go back to school!
I got all of them right by just looking,is that good or just sad lol.#realitaliansandtheircheeses 😂😂😂👌!
Wow! Look at that! A cheese expert with the power of two human eyes.
Wait, so.... i'm a cheese expert ? Cause i think anyone could've guessed the more expensive ones by tasting and smelling xD
Very easy to guess. I would have liked the actual names of the cheeses, especially the last one... What's the point if you don't tell what it is ?
I loved listening to her
I got every single one right just by looking at them, wheres my ''cheese expert'' title?
You can tell by looking at them for fuck sake
Thank you for such an interesting and educational short video.
This is sexy
I love cheese
I had no idea watching a beautiful woman cut the chees could be so educational. ; )
Was that fucking cheese *RAW*
The more expensive cheeses look more obvious, anyone who was asked to pick the more expensive cheese would go for a darker, oddly shaped and with a rind present cheese.  They should just have the inside of the cheese and have a direct taste test.
Wow i Got all of Them right just by looking at it...
Wait this is not buzzfeed
Why am I watching this? I just wanted to do some homework..
I know what I want to be when I grow up now
I got every single one right and I’m a fucking viking
Good God she must smell horrible
what am I doing here I have finals tomorrow
5 times more expensive?! By weight, it is 3.333 times more expensive.
What did i learn from this video?  A:You are getting ripped off for cheese in the USA. B: its easy to tell which cheese is more expensive just by sight.
Right off the bat....
ops just farted 1:17
This is obvious though
I’m gonna be honest, I prefer fresh goat cheese. I like a fresh, softer cheese that can be spread easily if I’m eating or serving goat cheese (and I LOVE herb encrusted goat cheese, usually a rosemary, basil, and other Italian style blend)
You guys bet a lot on this video
No vegan cheese :(
The more cheese = BLUE-ER EYES  Fact
wait what? you don't need to be an expert to see which one is more expensive! :S
We're Bass by U.D.O
Where Can I get her job?
I didn’t know the mother from modern family was a cheese expert
Do the same with wine :)
My experts say otherwise.
She should be a teacher! It’s usually so hard for me to learn anything new but i feel like i learned so much and i don’t even care abt cheese.
Now I know so much about cheese fmu
I thoroughly enjoyed this video. I love cheese and this lady did an amazing job describing the cheese and sharing her knowledge about manufacturing process. Holy smokes! share share share!!!
Liz Thorpe, she's pretty...
awesoome!!!!!
This is stupid, anyone can tell the difference visually
I am a cheese expert also, I decided I’m a expert after this video. Now when I look at cheese Ima say the cheese that always look old is more expensive. Thank you. Let me know if u need me to look at cheese to determine if it’s old and expensive
wow the cheese that looks more expensive is more expensive
You should do cheese expert tries vegan cheeses
She looks like a creamier, cheesier version of Julie Bowen
I also guessed everything right!! :D
i thought they would surprise her with one vegan cheese
so interesting
Rogue River 🤘🤘
white people really be out here eating cheese as a hobby, no lie
I don’t get how people could watch this video and question the fact that she’s a cheese expert,  she provided so much information for each cheese with her comparisons along with what causes each aspect she compares in the production of the cheese.  She also recognises some cheeses showing that she has experience.  Cheese isn’t like wine, it has a lot of cultural and scientific aspects separating different cheeses and making them recognisable instead of just all tasting and looking the same.  This video was obviously not made to call her out on being a fake cheese expert, they gave you tips on what cheese to buy and how to compare cheese for yourself.  The purpose of this video was to help inform people of different cheeses and the work that goes into it so that we will make more educated decisions in finding the right cheese for different occasions
irish flag instead of italian flag? how fucking stupid can you be like for real.
Why am I here? I don't even eat cheese
This is basic stuff.
Why did I watch this
Dang she knows her cheese
I watched till the end cos I was hoping that she will guessed wrong at least once. What a bummer.
Thanks for the education video
Cheesus!!
This was cheesy
Did anyone else noticed they added Ireland's flag instead of Italy's flag on 2:23?
“What did you go to college for”        “The study of cheese” “.......interesting....”🤔😂
So I’m a normal non-cheese expert and I could easily tell which of the cheeses was more expensive.  It wasn’t that hard
So. We’re all cheese experts.  Which ever cheese looks older,  costs more.
I'm a cheese expert I knew which one was more expensive just by looking at them. Didn't even have to taste them
Im waiting for her to start a class dedicated to cheese. I love her informatin
Would have worked better as a blind test to see if the cost difference can be tasted.
so, you go to the careers advisor and say, "I want to be a cheese expert!"
I have exams tomorrow, why am I here
3:26 thanks me later 0.5 speed
I'd love to get a good whiff of her cheesy breath 😫👌💓
well, maybe i am an expert too!
That's actually really hot!
I literally loved this and her and I don't even like cheese
Nice gouda cheesy video. Glad you got Youtube's parmesan to post. If it didn't send, I'd be feta.
Wow I really loved learning about cheese. Liz knows what she's talking about.
2:26 nice ireland flag
Your pronounciation of the different cheese types is so weird with the american accent
I should do homework but I somehow ended up here lol
at minute 6.28, it should be  *switzerland and the EU. by only saying the EU youre excluding switzerland, even though its swiss cheese lol
She talks way to much
fake
How can one be a cheese expert and have no clue or respect for the correct pronunciation of cheese names? Very informative bit, though :)
I am a cheese expert:proceeds to cut the corner of the cheese *faceplam*
This is the better Buzzfeed
fart? at 1:18 lol
Ewwww 10 month old cheese
€4/4oz is a fifth of €20/6oz? ok lmao
wow, probably the first "expert" video on youtube that actually know their shit, without sounding like a pretentious snob. very educational
American cheese? There's no American cheese. It's just processed stuff that have no comparison to the proper priced ones.
30$ for wax😂😂
Why did I want to see her reaction to craft singles?
Is the first flag supposed to be of Italy? Because its of Ireland?
I'm vegan and I don't even eat cheese but this was really interesting :D
I guessed them all just from the visual. It's really easy, especially with the rind left on. They should've just given small chunks or done it blind-folded instead.
Feta is so expensive in the states? Damn let me ship you some for like 3 bucks
Her breath prolly stank from all the cheese she eats
Highkey wanted her to get it wrong
at 2:27 they put an Irish flag instead of an Italian flag...
what do you do for a living, i am A FUCKING CHEESE EXPERT
this video just made my swiss heart smile :)
I just watched an 11 minute long video about nothing but cheese. I liked it.
"Right off the bat"
her math skills suck, at 4:00 she says the cheese is 5 times more expensive, but per oz it would be 3,33 times more expensive.
Clearly she knows her stuff, but even I guessed every one correctly and I didn't even taste it. Something like cheese where you can really see a difference is too easy.
i hope someday i will possess a ‘cheese expert’ title
Why is she calling the goat cheese «brie» when brie is a cow cheese and doesn't look like that at all?
Does she get paid for knowing her cheese?
fuck i wish i could be a cheese expert, where can i get this degree?
Buzzfeed is SHAKING
They should've just cut a piece and gave it to her
I love how informative this video is
they should do a blind taste test
well that means, the old cheese is the more expansive (Like Wine)  ! interesting!
Bruh i cringed when she said "gooda"
2:22 That's Ireland's flag...
i fucking love cheese yall
dam she knows her stuff about cheese
What kind of cheese expert calls it "goat cheese"? That isn't a type of cheese.....it is like saying "cow cheese". Goat cheeses are ANY TYPE OF CHEESE.
My favorite cheese is Gruyere cheese. What is yours?
Correction! Switzerland is not an EU member and does not get EU farm subsidies! It does have its own country level subsidies (the US also has agricultural subsidies), but is not a beneficiary of EU subsidies. Swizerland has some of the world's largest farm/agricultural subsidies, but these are to preserve traditional ways of foodmaking/agricultural ways of life and to offset the costs of doing business in one of the world's most expensive countries for farming and to be competitive with EU producers in their local markets!
Why does liz look like kate mckinnon
Her cheese farts though..WOOF
This was fucking delightful
How does one even become a cheese expert? Do you just get up one day and look at the cheese in the fridge and think "yeah thats what i wanna specialize in"?
Cuteness level = ∞+
I know nothing bout cheese but i knew all the answers?? Kinda obvious
I must be a cheese expert got them all right....
Can you eat the rind?
the way she says parmigiano reggiano makes me want to die
This video seems quite cheesy
She needs to get laid lol
Except for the feta I guessed all of them correctly, without tasting. Doesn't seem to be very hard...
It was so easy lol
"I do know my stuff, no just kidding" So you dont know ur stuff?
How do you become a so called cheese expert? Does she make and sell cheese? Does she work in a cheese manufacturer's research lab? Is she on the board of cheese approval/rating committees? Does she make money with her cheese expertise? Does she make money only from her (I assume cheese-centric) novels or in other cheese related ways? I want to be a cheese expert too but how do you get into a field like that?
Just that switzerland isn't in the EU... 6:30
The way she's prounancing 'parmigiano-reggiano' is so disturbing
the information was nice, but i would have preferred a blind taste test
TBH, aged cheese looks disgusting. I'd rather just eat my young cheese and live life.
Nah. Blindfold her and then let her tell me.
sperm cheese
I guessed all right by just looking at them
this lady needs a t.v show
I got all of them right it's usually the one that looks older than the older one
I'm craving cheese right now
1:17 jeez louise, who cut the cheese?
They didn't even used french cheese.... Come on !
This is incredibly interesting
Me: Okay great I have the whole day to study Me 5 minutes later: Cheese Expert Guesses Cheap vs Expensive Cheeses
Switzerland isn't part of the EU...
it all B....
I'd be honored if she took my hand in marriage and just talked to me about cheeses all day.
when you have this much knowledge about cheese...
Why x is more expensive than y has nothing to do with the amount of labour or cost of ingredients. It is about supply and demand.
just learned im a cheese expert as well.
The Italian flag is: Green White RED....you showed the Irish flag beside cheese A on the first taste..
WOW IM A CHEESE EXPERT!
She seems like someone who'd be able to solve a murder case simply based on her knowledge of cheese.
WHAT am I doing with my life ? cute woman tho !
Gooda, ParmeJaaaan, like wtf muricans.
Man... she’s a badass.
Then she realised she was lactose intolerent
Switzerland is not part of the EU....
excellent education that sparked an interest for me. thank you, Liz!
I didn't know cheese could be so freaking expensive. I'm fine with a cheap one that tastes good,  tho.  XD  Also,  I love how she basically says it's fine to pick the cheaper ones unless you want to really treat yourself.
Did she just say: “cheese people”? 4:25
Does no one else think she looks a bit like grace helbig?
I hate cheese
Eating rotten food for a living.
I learned a lot watching this
I kept reading the title as "Chinese expert“ and reread it and realised my stupidity
she kinda looks like cheese
blue cheese scares me lmao
i would eat your cheese wedge lady
http://www.france24.com/en/20171125-italys-top-cheeses-products-cruelty-campaign
Summary: cheese experts are better than wine experts.
wow hard to guess..3:28 my nuts smell better than this braincheese. had 5 o.o. 5 and im not even a cheese fan
After limit average holiday ideal orange free cold obviously global can
So a cheese that tastes like salted crayon.. is more expensive. How does that even work.
Isn't she the author of the cheese chronicles????? I love how details she explained everything.
She says "right off the bat" way too much
Guess I’m a cheese expert too because this was easy
My 6 year degree was a waste. I am gonna be a food expert, instead.    Milk and dairy is such a cruel production to make. People never think about that when looking at cheese. It's kind of sad.
Why the fuck am I watching this
thanks for demonstrating the different uses of the various cheese knives!!!
I could listen to her talk about cheese forever
I must be a cheese expert too XD I got them all right from the looks lol
Phill would love this video :))))
I like cheese but I am not a cheese lover; however, something is so cool about watching an expert talk passionately about something.
Is it better to eat older/younger cheese?
God sign me up to be a cheese expert
I wish I wasn't lactose intolerant
I think I know who I wanna be when I grow up
This was really good. Unlike a lot of the cheap vs expensive wine, etc episodes, this was one of the times where price point really reflected craft/effort and taste. She knows her stuff.
Perfect job does not exists.
She tried feta B twice...
Go vegan
1:18 I think she just farted. Must be all that cheese.
This is what I want to do for a living
She really knows her cheese.
This bitch knows her cheese
She does know her stuff o___o    amazing!
I hate people who ask for likes...        Im not kidding
Guessed them all right by the look. Pretty proud
"feda cheese" EVERY GREEK IN THE WORLD CRINGES. FETA. NOT "Feda"
Why are her eyes purple??
Hacks.
For some reason I was expecting snobbishness like an expensive vs. cheap wine tasting equivalent but it's much more relaxed than a wine tasting and fun and just as interesting
If ur a cheese expert then ur fat
I’m not even an expert but I got all the cheeses right.
I like this lady
Lesson learned: older cheese are much expensive.
Gosh i love how she provides information. 😂
Didn't feel right watching this video without snacking on some cheese... and so then I grabbed some feta cheese from my fridge and analysed it lmao
I’m not a cheese person n those cheeses look kinda gross. Lol
I got a dairy or cheese commercial on this video
What's up with all the fancy knives?
Blue cheese taste like what i think farts taste like. To me at least
I really sat here spending  ~11-12 minutes of my life watching someone eat cheese and telling me which one to definitely not buy/use for my nachos at a football party that everyone will probably just drink at
$20/6oz is not 5x as expensive as $4/4oz. Math is hard for this cheesehead.
love cheese,eat it everyday.I noticed that she was cutting with more then 1 knife;any info on what type of knife is best for selected cheeses would be appreciated.Also,if you had to choose 1 knife for all your cheese,which one?
Guys, let's be honest, the older the cheese, the more expensive it is, and the older cheese is the more obvious it becomes that it's been aged, so did we need an "expert" to tell us which cheese was more yellow?  Edit: I'm laughing my ass off right now, I legitimately cannot believe how many sensitive pussies I offended with this comment, it surprises me how soft this generation is and I'm ashamed to be part of it, people are truly desperate and pathetic these days.
Did anyone notice the knife with holes that looked like cheese?
I guessed them just be the look.
So what I learned wine experts =bullshit  Cheese experts on the other hand know what’s up
She cuts a lot off then takes a small bit off it... also it seemed kinda obvious because you can see the find on the outside of the cheese
With the amount of cheese given to guess I could guess correctly just by looking. I am not a cheese expert. Interesting framing for a cheese info dump though I guess.
4:30 - Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Cover the ears!!!!!!!!!!!!
Her daughter's name is Brie. 100%
I like cheese 🧀
the cheese looking knife i like that
i could tell immediately by looking at them
This is good
Someone tell  me about colleges that offer cheese classes. It must be a serious class not a cheesy one 😏😏
It’s like inside edition “experts”
I like her.  She knows her stuff 100%, but she's not a snob.  Even 'cheap' cheese has it's place in her world.
Am I the only one that got triggered because  she cut a piece of the cheese but ate like 5/6 of it
Am I an expert because I can easily tell which one is more expensive and what they are just by what it looks like?
I feel like just looking at them regular people can figure it out themselves. like if you agree.
Now im craving some cheese
Cannot believe I just wasted 11 minutes of my life watching a professional cheese taster taste cheese
Everything is fruity I've never heard anyone say cheese is fruity
...OK, originally I read this as 'Chinese experts", and I was all "what does that have to do with...oh, right. Nevermind."
I fucking love cheese
I'm kinda turned on by here eating cheese. Is any one else feeling that ?
Ummm I can definitely tell this is a cheese
I was expecting this to be like the BuzzFeed video a while back where they brought experts to taste cheap vs. expensive coffee, donuts and sushi. Those experts came off snooty and elitist without justification. But the expert in this video was very objective, not judgemental about the cheeses and really provided her knowledge and decision making process which I loved!
Watching this while taking a guess and I'm right about cheese I guessed more expensive
What irritated me is that she always took a slice of cheese and didn’t eat the whole portion she cut off
Alpine style cheese B is called Pleasant Ridge Reserve. I know because I worked with that cheese for almost 3 years. It is exactly what she says it is. Creamy, tangy and a little fruity. It’s made in Wisconsin and is 100% worth special ordering. I also recommend the blue wrapped in the grape leaves. Looks like the Rogue River Blue. It is a-ma-zing
I guess you could say....       This video is pretty cheesy
Excuse me there needs to be an entire show about cheese this was amazing
dear cheese lady,  $20 for 6 oz is not 5x more than $1/oz.
1:18 did i hear a fart?
i just realized i know absolutely nothing about cheese
I smelled the cheese through my computer.
fart @ 1:18 ?lol
Wow she knows her cheese. On point, informative and entertaining analysis.
LOL WHO CUT THE CHEESE 1:17
she was brilliant
She knows her stuff
Why would u be an cheese expert though??
She said Cheese so many times that now it's starting to sound weird to me. Cheese....Cheese.....Cheese....
I want contact lenses like hers. Except they'll be too expensive for me.
im lactose intolerant so why am i watching this
I think a non cheese expert could figure out which is more expensive
My dream job
why did they use irish flag for the Parmesan Reggiano?
It would be sad if she later on became lactose-intolerant, hahaha
is it weird that I guessed the cheeses right before she even revealed the prices XD  *I don't even like cheese*
Good she is cheese expert couse maths are not her strongest side :D
I wonder what her breath smells like?
Whats stupid about this video, is that the older the cheese, the more expensive. The more mold the more expensive. You dont need to be an expert to guess the first two.
Wait.... you mean an "expert" that actually knows what they're talking about?
dream job
6:16 REEEEEEEEEEEEEE THE SWISS FLAG IS IN THE WRONG RATIO
My mouth is wet  ... I wanna eat this cheese
Lol. Older cheese is always more expensive than the younger version
"its like biting into a crayon" "tastes like cheese candy"   umm, what?
That was awesome.  I'd try all of those.
Even I can tell which is more expensive, and I hate cheese
I don’t know why I find this interesting. I guess my life it’s just boring
I love the combination of confidence in her amazing competence and the nervousness to see if her guess was right. Also, such pertinent information, good job!
I'm almost crying.... I hate cheese so much. I fucking hate it
2:54 that looks disgusting.
I've been in Reggio Emilia. Beautiful place!!
Imagine your job being CHEESE EXPERT. So jealous.
There are any number of videos on YouTube about how to make Farmer Cheese. I cannot recommend this enough. It takes about 20-30 minutes, start to finish and you can make the most amazing, soft, warm, crumbly/melty cheese you've ever had. Go with goat's milk and add salt, dill and oregano. You just made your own Boursin/style cheese.
I usually think the "expert" types videos are just bs with people talking out their ass. But everything she said made sense and seemed to really know her stuff. So that's cool. Also cheese is lit.
I didn't think this would be as educational as it turned out to be.
damn i could blow my whole wad on some cheese like these
HOLD ON. She's a cheese expert but she pronounces "Gouda" as [Gooduh]?
Impressive
This is so easy to guess by looking at it
was hoping to hear some more explanation behind the leaf wrapped one/why the leaf and what it does
Why am I watching this at 3 am
Love this.  She explains the differences in the cheeses very well.  Wish I could be there to taste them as well.
im not a cheese expert and i can answer these easily just by the look
I bet she’s happy that she’s not lactose intolerant
why am I here
Im far away from being a cheese expert and i still was right (almost) every time. She should have worn a blindfold, that would have been impressive and more entertaining.
lovely vid!
Par mee jiano rejiano OML 😂😂😂😂
Ah, I get it. It's more expensive because It's made less. Let me just start putting my dna in the cheese and start selling it for 50$ more
Your own personal cheeses
SPLURGE
I don't know why I watched the entire video... I'm lactose intolerant
She didn’t need to taste it SHE WANTED to taste it
She's very pleasant.
Tbh i have no idea about cheese but these were pretty easy to guess. The cheese with the more intricate appearance was p much the more expensive
This was a give away tbh. I'm not a cheese expert but I know cheese that has been aged by looking at it as a result I know the more expensive one.  The only difference between myself and her, is that she knows other details like whether it's been grass-fed etc but challenge her next time make her taste them blind-folded and then we'll call her an expert.
i need a woman like this in my life.... a real cheese woman
She is totally great. Not only her knowledge is top notch but she is very good at explaining and has a contagious enthusiasm for her work. You end up wanting to study more.
goat cheese is the most disgusting food on the planet. it's like they give the goat a bath in the milk before they make the cheese out of it.
I'm sorry, I can't stand her saying parmashon
sartori parmesan made in wisconsin is the best I've ever tried.  real parmigiano reggiano is overrated.
It is 2 am, why am I looking at this xd?
this nigga eats crayons? 1:11
first up: this cheese old as FUCK
she is very kind to all of the cheeses.
Come on, blind taste test
New buzzfeed???
Mom. I've found my dream job
I love it when an expert is an expert without being a snob.
Didnt Buzzfeed do this?
I don't even like cheese so much, and I don't know how I ended up here, but I watched the whole thing and enjoyed it :D
I could guess just by looking at it!
Anyone notice at 2:26 the used the Irish flag and not the Italian?
What was the point of tasting it? it seems to me you can always tell which one is the most expensive from how much its been aged, and is there any big differences in milk quality? like wagyu beef is much higher quality compared to normal beef etc?
her skin's pretty good for a cheese expert
Now I know this bitch is constantly constipated... 🤣
So if it looks bad it's better
The uglier looking one is more expensive.
I think anyone with eyes can see which is more expensive
I highly recommend Good Mythical Morning's 'Name that Cheese' after this video. I'm watering from seeing that Blue Cheese shown because I know that's expensive from the leaf cover alone. Beautiful, salty goodness. Yum!
I'm lactose intolerant.. This is making my stomach hurt
It's 3am I don't know how I got here
she sounds imprseed she got it rigth lol
u didnt need a expert fr this
Why don't you list all the cheeses she tried?
'Emilia' *TRIGGERED*
This video was awesome, I'd love to see more of these types of videos!
She's a real expert
she really knows her stuff!  ^^
the music sounds like Zelda:Twilight Princess
Who else is eating cheese while watching
Take a shot when every time she says Parmegiano Reggiano at the first one.
im jack thorpe and never knew you existed
What a horrible job. I might have to sacrifice myself and switch with her. For her sake of course. I'm that much of a good person.
I hate cheese why am I here
i could have guessed the first 1 the first 5 seconds i sawy it
Any Swiss person could've done the same job : ^)
Flavor is objective, price is irrelevant
If you're such a cheese expert then why haven't you tryed Casu Marzu cheese?
She identified everything visually instead of a blind taste test.
The only one that wasn't obvious was the feta.  I would have guessed the one that had the least flavor, and was packed in water, to be the least expensive.
"cheese expert" >totally butchers parmigiano reggiano's pronunciation
I picked all of those out as more/less expensive within seconds of seeing them... hardly difficult!
What a bullshit guessing game.  How about an apples to apples comparison.
This was the dumbest fucking challenge? If you wanted it to be true it needed to be completely blind and cut a piece from each shaped the same. You see a triangle thats clearly bought from a grocery store vs a fucking giant wedge from what is clearly a wheel and has a rind what the fuck you dont have to be a cheese expert to clearly tell which is more expensive. Terrible test.
in the thumbnail she looks like the one from Modern Family
Really insightful but I think a blindfold would have taken it another step up. There'd be more surprise and an unfolding story instead of the tell tale visual signs.
I'm the random greek person that fucking loves feta and wonders how it tastes around the world....
You do not have to be a cheese expert to determine the expensive ones in this video. The right choices were obvious in this case.
Why did she say "just kidding" after obviously knowing her stuff ? weird...
Why am I watching this? I need to revise and I couldn’t care less
So this is a dishonest experiment because if she is a cheese expert she should know what the Cheese look like just from the rind. Like the blue you can tell one is Rogue River blue and the other one is Stilton you can just tell that by the rind
i guessed every cheese correctly i am a cheese expert 2 jk lol but i guessed them correctly xD
What is the name of the leafed one?
Yeah, this lady is quite personable but the only checked 'facts' in the vid was the price and I correctly guessed all but the feta without tasting or smelling them -and i'm not a "cheese expert". She is doing what "wine experts" do in reverse, if they really gave a crap they would have powdered a little and gave her that to taste -any idiot can tell the age of two wildly different cheeses from rind and texture.
Ehm, about the Gruyère... Switzerland is not in the EU, but apart from that, certainly in traditional cheesemaking, in Europe, cheesemaking simply tends to follow the season. I.o.w. your cheese there was probably made in December/January (it being approx. 10 months old) when the cows are fed on feed and hay, hence the cheese is paler. Buy gruyère that's made in the summer/early fall and it'll be more yellow. While dairy farming for consumer milk is still being oversubsedised (it's been cut back though), I don't think cheesemaking is and I doubt their bottom line is any better because of it, as most cheesemakers have dedicated dairy farms.
Impressive and informative. I got all but the feta right :)
Tfw you can tell the more expensive one by which one looks weirder.
Is it racist that at a first glance I thought the title said Chinese experts instead of cheese experts?
Can someone recommend me a good cheese fundue place in Toronto? I want it very bad after watching this video!
OMG Did anyone else noticed that she has purple eyes!!? 😱
im not a cheese expert but that wasnt hard to figure out ¬.¬
You didn't need an expert on most of those to tell which was more expensive. However, she did provide a lot of information on why it looks different. Good video
She better be from Wisconsin
To me its just... Cheese...
that first shit looks like straight up to fungus
What did i learn? The uglier the cheese, the more expensive.
Damn she is good!
wow, if i was making love with this lady, we would be sharing cheese in the bed.
Boonk gang that blue cheese
Why did I even watch this?  I don't like cheese.
Reads the script..."So I think this is...."
What does she think of Dick Cheese?
LIZ OFMFMFM
love learning about stuff like this
She isn't really guessing here, this is more like a cheese speech, if you challenged her to guess... then I'd be interested, this is just some lady talking about her work...
wow i'm a cheese expert
Nice to have the reassurance there's something behind being an expert in such a field.  Also, the U.S. is making a better cheese than the Swiss?  I would not have taken that bet.
Critique cheese and get paid for it? Best job ever
Around the 7:24 mark and 7:31 mark you guys have an editing mistake. You show the same clip of her picking up the same piece of cheese B twice when prior to the second clip she is clearly reaching for cheese A and after she is also talking about cheese A.
No. This has gone too far. I have no interest in this. Why am I watching this? What has youtube done to me.
Gnarly usually wins.
Hey mom guess what I want to be when I grow up?
This is sad
Im not an expert but i got em all right
Person : what do You want to be when You Grow up ? Me :
This makes me want a cheese stick
It's funny how the vast majority of the analysis was based on appearance, allowing a preconception to be formed before the cheese was tasted. I wonder how she would have fared had this been a blind taste test?
Am I the only one who hates cheese with a passion?
All these cheeses are fucking RAW.
Still can't pronounce there names, I don't think I have ever heard an american pronounce non american words properly.
It's cheese....
I’m not a cheese expert, but I got them all right. :p
I always have a wedge of parmesiano reggiano cheese in the fridge. I dont think its that expensive because the flavor is so strong you generally dont need much of it.
great video, learned a lot
I'm usually pretty skeptical of these kinds of experts, but she's good. knows her stuff!
She’s passionate
shes hot
Not gonna lie, the rind and protein particles look and sound nasty
funny that the expert cant pronounce the names correclty........ gouda is pronounced guda by americans but correctly it should be chrauda with the chr a guttural ch. parmesan is pronounced like parmeshan by americans but should be parmeSSan. a soft short s. the list goes on.....
Wtf was Bertram not here??
She is amazing!
Im really not into learning video but this one really got me in it
And I know one kind of cheese:Cheese
I love Cheese
While the information is interesting,I keep wondering,I as a consumer only know barely 3 or 4 kinds of cheese, at max.In the video,there must be another cheese connoisseur or expert,who have gathered all those cheese to make a comparison,not just comparison,a very well informed ,educated and  close comparison,you cant just compare just any cheese as the difference will be obvious.So,may be,just may be,would i be wrong to assume that that expert might  be herself ,who put together all those cheese for comparison,and the prices,so that the flow of information is good,and my be she knew what would be more pricey,as it would be humiliating to find out an expert is just as perplexed as we are,when it comes to food,taste and their real worth in terms of taste buds.
she knows a lot about cheese
Omg she's actually a cheese expert
She's amazing! I'm glad you left the rind on, even if it gave her more clues, I feel like I learned a lot more!
Anyone else sad that for the blue cheese she didn't say where that one farm is that makes it and why it's wrapped in a leaf? Also, I know almost nothing about cheese but I could tell which one was more expensive just by looking at it.
One thing I’m expert at. Eating. 😂
she seems like she makes bomb mac&cheese!
How is she an expert...The expensive one is obvious every damn time lol
Um thought it said chinese...
Right of the bat....
I wouldn't say they guessed that since a guess is like ok let's go with A and they actually got to break down the components which make the cheese more expensive
I wouldn't need to be a cheese "expert" to take a look and see which one looks more "aged" therefore expensive .
I got all correct
4:00  Minor oversight - The expensive goat cheese is <2 times as expensive (not 5 times) because the labelled weights are different.
Cheeseologist
where was the dick cheese??
"have to taste" giiiiirlll you wanted to taste it!
Charlie Kelly would leave the Waitress for her.
Yes! Actually gives information unlike anything for views buzzfeed
Vegans incoming...
You really know your cheeses!
Wow this video is so interesting. I learned so much from it
A cheese expert that does not notice the difference between Parmigiano Reggiano and parmisan cheese..
This is interesting, i dont rly like cheese so idk that the more aged cheese r the more expensive. The aged cheese looks ugly, i would think those white spots are molds lol this is a good information tho. But still those hard ass old cheese doesnt look appealing to me
Wow I guessed all but one right :D I should know this because as an Italian my bones are made of cheese
Any french could answer 100% and I'm sure that the parmesan style is more a grana padano than a parmesan, cause paremsan is protected in some region of italia.
I enjoyed the information, but the test felt kind of pointless. I don't claim to be a cheese expert but even I was able to visually identify every single one of those as to which was the most expensive.
Damn she knows her cheese
Should have had her blindfolded
yeah, still not the expensive cheese i've ever bought XD
Plot twist, she’s lactose intolerant.
I never found someone with my last name, and she has it, I'm so happy, all hail the Thorpe family
tip to be rich : buy a cheese from the market and leave it anywhere in your house, forget about it for a 18 months and congrats ! you can sell it x4 the price !
she looks like the modern family mom
this is retarded, you let yourself look at the full product without tasting. That equals cheating. bad video. LMAO 😂😂😂
I too, am a cheese expert
Danish feta is supposedly better than greek and made on cows milk!
I wish I knew as much about anything as she knows about cheese.
Interestingly, in Greek, feta or φετα means slice. So every time you ask for "feta cheese" you are asking for a slice of cheese.
My Toast also has these little with patches. Seems like Toast just needs a couple of days to build Protein Crystals....
i'm not cheese expert, i don't even like cheese but i guessed all of them right, the key is the ones that look older, weirder or darker texture are usually more expensive.
IT IS NOT 5 TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE! ONE IS $4/4oz  AND THE OTHER IS $20/6oz. IT PISSES ME OFF WHEN PEOPLE MISTREAT INFORMATION. IT IS NOT 5 TIMES AS EXPENSIVE, IT IS 10/3 (ten thirds or 3.3333...) TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE!!!
tfw I'm allergic to goat's milk along with a lactose sensitivity and I will never be able to enjoy fine cheese :(((
i’m amazed
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THORPE
$4/4oz is $1/oz, $20/6oz is $3.33/oz. 3 is not 5 x 1. you may know cheese but you certainly don't know arithmetic.
I loved this video! I love cheese, and the  so information was awesome. She is definitely likable too. I’d watch other videos of her explaining cheese and the like.
Cheese science is so interesting, I could watch this all day
The ratios on the goat cheeses do not make the aged 5x more expensive. But dam she is good with chz lol
“Right off the bat”
What, no triple cream brie comparison?
Respect to people who KNOW which food is more expensive but goes with taste even if it means it's cheaper :)
You made it easy for her.
Well that was bullshit any idiot can see which one is more expensive with out even tasting it the information is interesting the "challenge" not so much
This was so interesting. I played along, I got all of them right! This was so fun.
I’m sure a non cheese expert could guess which one was aged and which one is more expensive. Cheese experts are just like food critics. A bunch of fakes
I think she became lactose intolerant.  Did you heard the same thing than me at 1:18 ?
the way she described the cheeses was extremely bad. taste wise. whenever you describe cheese you're supposed to describe it in a positive way. and you don't just say 'it's like.. waxy'' and 'has this weird, brainy looking like rind', 'it's like sticking to my mouth. i can barely talk'.  you talk about it in a lot more detail. more in-depth flavors. and always positive. never negative. also i think it's fair enough to say that even non-cheese experts can see which cheeses are the more expensive ones visually speaking. without even taste testing. this video would be far more interesting if you would ask random people on the street to taste test the cheeses and guess which ones are more expensive. i am not trying to be rude and i guess she did say some things that might seem interesting to absolute cheese novices. but in my opinion the way she delivered it wasn't very professional.
you need to do these tests blind.
what does her poop look like
It’s so cute that she gets so happy when she’s right about the cheese
This is by far the most well-informed and educated specialist i've seen do one of these challenges. Normally food and wine snobs go on about the ridiculous tastes they experience but get the price wrong. She knows her cheese!
Agreed, should probably have given small cubes
Does anyone know what the leaf-wrapped blue cheese is called? My interest is piqued!
It's not Italian flag it's Irish
lmao, what a BULLSHIT job
I want this chick to taste my schmegma......
Ive never learned so much about cheese in my life
I'm going to take a shot every time she says Parmesan or regianno
cheese expert, is "parmigiano regiano" not "paermigyano reygiano"
I could guess which one is the more expensive too, not that hard.
I guessed them all right so I guess you dont need such a thing as a cheese expert to tell you which one is more expensive
Taste my milk then i taste yours., which is more expensive wahahahhaa.. lol
Mmmm,bull shit!
great video! shes knows her cheese.
I’m seeing a lot of sexist comments on this cheese video and I feel people are doubting her cheese ability because of her sweet and polite mannerisms. Yes she can see the cheese. She is trying to teach you! I’m sure she could do this blindfolded too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvppFMRy0ZE the cheese rap
This study is null and void as the subject was not given a true blind test.
At first i was like, why would anybody waste their time on something so stupid!?, but its actually a baddass art, cheese.
Literally I guessed them all right, just look at the ugliest fucking one and that's it
Anyone noticed how the knife has a cheese-hole pattern on it? It seems cool!
Would be nice if the look wasn't a dead giveaway on all of them.
Funny, I don't think it's very necessary to support American cheese makers. In fact I think as an European it's more important for me to support European cheese makers. Nice lady, but she forgot that she is speaking to a worldwide audience.
I thought the title said Chinese expert
Cheese for $100, Alex
I don't know how i got here but this was pretty interesting and informative.
you just grab the worst looking cheese and say it´s expensive. Then say some made up facts about the nasty looking cheese. It dosen´t even matter if it´s true.
Im not an expert and im sure i can tell the difference between appearence and taste. She is not doing something that difficult.
minute 1:17 is that a fart
You can so tell which cheese is more expensive just by looking at it, I mean you don't need a cheese expert to find these out
The cheese knife looks like cheese that made my day
This is so dumb. “Cheese expert”, I could do this shit easily
how do you become a cheese expert? At what moment in life do you realise you are a cheese expert?
she kinda looks like cheese
What the fuck am I watching.
Should have been a blind taste test. I know nothing about cheese and got them all right, easy.
@ 4:00 it's actually not 5 times more expensive because the quantity per $ is different.
Saturated fat...
Id let her sample my cheese stick.
sis said “it’s waxy, kind of like biting into a crayon” like no thanks, i’ll stick to the regular, creamy parm and not because of price.
Before the vid: Cheese expert? Oh please, that's not a thing. After the vid: Wow, she really knows her stuff. I wonder where she got her cheese degree.
3:59 It's only about three times more expensive per ounce. $4/4oz-$20/6oz
If you're sitting around with your friends eating cheese you are missing the point of life.
Haha i live in modena cheese here is great
But can she ell the difference between Greek feta and Bulgarian feta?
i feel sorry for you american's i can get Parmigiano Reggiano for 7 dollars a pound in the uk from a local super market.
She was an awesome presenter. She actually taught me stuff.
the pronunciation of cheese names is funny
Meh. I'll just stick with local Wisconsin Cheese.
what am i doing
I wanna be a cheese expert :(
Doesn't take an expert to pick out the more expensive cheese from the two
So original style parmesan....she just said "original" in Italian to make it sound fancy.
Amazing!
She must have a hard time shitting
She can't even do simple math
Basically, the worse they look, the more expensive they are.
lmfao it doesnt take an expert to do this lol
Shape made it way too easy would be cool to see it just on taste alone. Same size little cubes no rind.
I could tell from the time each pair was put on the table. I should call myself cheese expert from now on :D
This is so cool! I wish I knew so much about fancy things like whine or cheese :D
Wow! I only missed one.
from the title I thought it would show an "expert" be tricked, why the heck did I need to see an Expert show her expertise
I guess she's an expert for a reason....
It was too obvious imo... Good information on the other hand, i love cheese. Fresh buffalo mozzarella is my favorite. Also a fan of other aged strongly tasting types.
This woman knows her dairy! Nice!
How..... do i get this job?
I would of bit the whole damn thing. She cut it by 1/10.
She "needs" to taste em.
I didn't expect to learn so much about cheese today
I got all of them right and I know nothing about cheese lol
was that a fart at 1:18?
"cheese expert" .................. apparently  im a cheese expert myself :O
Bring her back for part 2!!
I want to throw in a guess: The last cheese was wrapped in grape leaves
Why does the first cheese have the Irish flag on the card for the price
maybe you should stop being obsessed with cheese since it requires animal farming which is an unsustainable practice to begin with. not to mention that consumption of cheese has been linked to cancer and various other diseases.
Who the fuck mistakes Italy's flag with Ireland's??
I'm vegan why am I here
her breath probably smelled so bad after this
I’m not a cheese expert and I can tell which one is the more expensive one just by looking at it. It should have been a blind taste test then we can see if she really is an expert or not.
More videos like these!
what i get is, the uglier the cheese, the more expensive it is
I bet her home is farted up like crazy. Just a indoor fog of farts!
Those cheese knives tho.  I see people complaining why isn't it tested blindly. This is supposed to be an informative video for normal consumers so they know what to look for. Appearance is part of it.
wheres the deek cheese?
Why this is stupid is because the expensive cheese always looks way different and aged. Cheap cheese always looks like the shopping Walmart shit
I'm no cheese expert, but I can tell which is the most expensive just by looking... I just love cheese!
I'm Greek the funny thing is that by looking I realized which feta was from Greece 😂 since we eat mostly that cheese
Tilterella's Sion's cheese is the best imo
i cant wait for buzzfeed to make the same video...
This is the kinda video where you look at the title and you’re just like...sure
cheese expert my ASS plz pronounce reggiano correctly for the sake of all Italians subjected to this
1:17 def a fart
Its kinda funny to see the comments here. I was lucky enough to grow up with a family that loved cheese, so most of this is quite basic to me. But it is fascinating to get a perspective from other people. For example if this video was of beef, I would have no idea and find it very interesting.
Cheap cow pus vs expensive cow pus. How nice
okay so what i learned today: *nothing....*
I watched this whole video thinking this was buzzfeed. Imagine my surprise when I checked to see who made it.
WTF how is goat cheese B 5 times more expensive than cheese A if A is $4 / 4oz  and B is $20 / 6oz?
Seems like I'm a cheese expert. Literally got all of them right lol.
“Cheese 🧀 expert” that is new
Can I marry her!? *.* Awesome vid :D
I literally only clicked this because the thumbnail was so batshit retarded I couldn’t help it
$20/6oz is not 5 times more expensive than $4/4oz
I could listen to her talk about cheese all day.
Italian cheese, Irish flag?
Expert ??? i can tell u this by just looking at them for 5 sec's come on .............
Damn, I want to get paid to eat cheese.
You all missed the point of the video! She has a CHEESE CLEAVER!
Forget the waitress, I think I found Charlie Kelly's new love...
I'd get the cheap one every time
You dont need to be a "Expert" at cheese to tell. The ones with the rind and smell is often the more expensive one. DUH And WTF is a cheese expert. We have Expert for anything these days.
She must be so constipated
With blind fold she would gotten at least one wrong. Basically in most cases if it is dark she realized it is old and aged so it is expensive.
after she cuts it why does she only take a very small bite?
1:18 is this a fart?
Cheese Expert seriously ? Well I'm a Interdimetional Travel Expert then
4:04 Being a cheese expert doesn't require any math knowledge. haha.
Basically if I leave out the cheese for long it's expensive.
You don't need an expert to guess which is more expensive...
No guessing what so ever
2:25 I’m no expert in geography, but I’m pretty sure that’s the flag of Ireland on the left.
Should have been blind folded
I thought this women was Kellyanne Conway by the thumbnail preview. I was wtf is lmao.
Hats off to the country with the world's best cheese! Norway!! :D
This was so relaxing and entertaining at the same time.
I learnt alot. Great video What an attractive and animated speaker
You really need a "cheese expert" for this? Is that even a real thing? I know nothing or have never tasted any of these and I guessed all of them right. Fucking idiots, shit video.
i dont know anything about cheese i missed only one. not that hard lady
Why was this in my recommended videos?
Im vegan but this was really interesting :)
What is up with liking cheese?  I've tried expensive cheese and honestly I prefer those fake American yellow slices that look like plastic
Why would u need a expensive cheese when u can't even figure it out which is the expensive one and need an expert to try it
I must be a cheese expert.
As long it looks older with more contrast and rind, then it is more expensive. That’s not hard to guess at all hey?
The 2 first was easy ass fuck, anybody with an IQ over 110 could guess that
I don't know a lot about cheese. But I know a lot about Feta Cheese. Being that it's probably part of my DNA, along with olive oil, oregano and bread, at this point, I can tell good Feta from shit Feta. The best Feta is French. The only way I'd eat Greek style feta is when I make Byrek (spinach pie) and thats cuz Greek feta is more firm and it still retains texture when cooked. Like style cheeses are also made in Albania from cows, goats, and sheep's milk. They are firm cheeses. Yum yum. Trahana with butter and fried cheese *praise the Lord meme*
Why is the Irish flag there instead of the Italian flag :/
I'm trash.. only cheese I ate are cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan and feta..
I'm French, the way she cuts cheese offends me
i wish they gave the producers' names.
She is a cheese nerd
Kinda made it obvious which was more expensive. Which one was the most decorative/ Which one looked like absolute shit?
How is she a cheese expert if she cant pronounce anything
i, too, am a cheese expert, let me come on and eat cheese (^:
cheese expert??? pfff probably never heard of etivaz....
The "fueya" cheese from Asturias is a blue-green cheese in leaves, too.
Great video. Lots of info and devoid of any snobbery towards the cheaper products.
fake & gay.
Honestly how pretensious can people be. Who gives a shit about price, do a blind taste test on which tastes better. I dont want to spend £40 on some truffle parmisano shit if it tastes like sticking your tongue up an india mans ass and letting it fement in there
1:25 in and I'm already calling this as garbage. No one buys a block of Parmesan aged that much for their weekly shop. Most Parmesan bought is MUCH younger than that. You're talking about a cheese for eating on its own vs cheese for a dish. I generally buy Reggiano, and it never looks that aged.  I realise this is about educating Americans about cheese, but this isn't the way to do it.
She's so Humble🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
must be annoying to meet someone who hates cheese as they would just loose all respect for your career.
I am pretty sure that the flag used in the first cheese is an Irish flag when it's supposed to be an Italian flag
i love the face she makes when she says "ok, now i need to taste these"
This video was paid for by a cheese consortium. It wasn't a test at all
This was so easy, I would've only been stumped on the feta, and I don't even like cheese.
This is way better than any buzzfeed video.
Damn I️ want cheese now
So she's amazing!!!
That went much better than the blind wine tastings I've seen!
My wife has some cheese you can try!
I was waiting for her to get fooled and it turning into an ad
It was interesting to know why exactly they are more expensive, but i guessed them all right, and the only cheese i eat is cheap supermarket off-brand cheese. It's very easy to notice by texture, age and so on. For example all cheap fetas i have tried would all be "crumbly", so as soon as i saw that texture i knew it was cheaper than the one that was smooth.
whoever made the card for the permigiano-reggiano doesn't know the difference between the irish flag and the italian flag lol smh
She must be farting a lot
That’s the Irish flag.
How did I end up watching someone eat cheese? O_O
Someone idk: What's your dream job  Me:Cheese expert
BEST FOOD CHANNEL EVER !
You could tell by the rinds the ENTIRE time. This was so set up so she wouldn’t get it wrong
the suspese thing about prizes really bugs me, it is so unnecesary
sooooo... basically I am a cheese expert? I guessed all the cheeses right and knew all the stuff she mentioned.   Cool, good to know. Experts, yeah!
You can't show her the mf cheese
20 Dollar pro 6oz isn´t 5 times more expensive than 4 Dollar pro 4oz
It's like wine, but the expert can actually tell the difference. XD
They were super easy to guess because right off the bat they looked very different so what's the point of this?
if shes a cheese expert obv she would know if its cheap or expensive stupid video idea
Liz: I'm Liz Thorpe and I'm a cheese expert.  Tom: It's 3:17 AM and you're tuned in with your main man, Tommy Inglethorpe.
"I do know my stuff" you do girl! Good job!
You cannot have feta cheese with cow milk...feta is just with goat milk from Greece....and that makes it Protected Designations of Origin cheese
I wanna try the most smelly cheese..wonder how to get in in sweden
On the next episode: A historian guesses real vs fictional events
Why does she always use different knife ? :D
Why am I watching a video of a woman reviewing cheese
basically the old ones with the rind is more expensive
Damn this video is cheesy
How is she able to leave the rest of the cheese there omg
I bet her farts stink. 😂😂😂
I would like to volunteer to help her eat the cheese. Not that I'm an expert or any kind, I just want to eat cheese
I'm a cheese expert ... that's like really intense.. wow !
Is it just me or do they use an Irish flag instead of an Italian one at 2:24 ?
Had this been done blind I don't think you would get the same results.
Would have been interesting if they didn't use cheeses with such a difference. I'd like to see if she is able to tell the difference in the taste/texture from the two cheeses that are more similar. Doesn't take a car expert to tell the difference between a ferrari and a fiat. I was able to tell wich one is the more expensive one just buy looking. I'm not a cheese expert by the way.
WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FLAG LABELS !!! FIRE THEM ! For the first cheese she said is from ITALY but they used the IRISH FLAG !!!! This is so cringe omg 😩😩😩
I dont like cheese but im italian. She cant prononce shit and really whayt she is saying is just obvious
This was very insightful! It just makes you have a further appreciation for the craft and its professionals and scholars - especially for our farmers who care to make cheeses the traditional way.
Why have they used the Irish flag for the reggiano?
An American expert on cheese!! Ha ha ha what a joke !! US does not produce what us Europeans call cheese, in fact most of French cheese (raw milk) are forbidden in the US. Come to Europe and try our cheeses, they will knock your socks off!
easy guess all the way
Wow she defiantly knows her stuff
She is NOT a cheese expert she CANT FUCKING PRONOUNCE PARMIGANO REGGIANO
Maybe do this blindfolded?
i thought this was buzzfeed
the most evident different cheeses where picked...obvious responses...dont need to be an expert
I like her. She's charismatic, friendly, knowledgeable and pretty funny.
Why was I so invested in this?? I'm hooked!
shit video.... you could have used a homeless guy on crack and still guessed correctly wich one of the cheeses is more expensive only by looking at them...
Im a pussy expert, i can tell from cheap to expensive too
Meh....not really a test. She can spot from visual. Too easy.
Teacher: What do you wanna do when you grow up? Liz: I wanna become a cheese expert.
There's loads of new channels that make entertaining videos "like buzzfeed" and I ain't complaining ;)
This exercise took an 'expert'? Using only the image on my laptop, and without any of the aroma, texture or flavour of the cheese, I was 4/4. This video was extremely unimpressive.
Damn I actually learned something. On a fucking Saturday.
Wait this isn't buzzfeed?
Should've snuck velveeta in there.
is her eyes purple or is it just me?
The more disgusting it looks the more expensive it is.
If something looks terrible then it's expensive.
I got all of them right just by looking at them before she said anything so yeah. I love CHEESE YUM
nailed just by looking at it. yuzz
"How much cheese is too much cheese?" - Charlie Kelly
Any casual french person would easily determine the same thing as the "expert"
I ate pecorino while watching this.
Everything was pretty obvious
“smells kinda nutty”
im vegan but this is so fascinating
3:59 actually no it is not 5 times more expensive, look closely.
The goats cheese isn't a brie style, it's a crottin style.
women that know their shit about their specific fields are really hot
Haha that'sna cheesy job
What annoyed me was that she took a big piece off of the cheese and took a tiny bite instead of eating the whole thing
Her breath must have been really terrible after this
I clicked on this expecting to get bored and change to something else but I actually found it super interesting! Thanks for the info
Its 2 am what am i doing here?
Someone has been cutting the cheese!
For the goat cheese it is actually about 3.3 times more expensive, the oz was different so if you make the price the numerator and the denominator the oz then make the fractions have a common denominator then that makes 12/12 and 40/12, 40 divided by 12 that makes about 3.3 times more expensive
Got them all right too.  Can you eat blue cheese if you are allergic to penicillin?
Loved this. More videos with Liz Thorpe! She was great. Informative, clear, not at all pretentious. Five stars! :)
i cant believe i just spent 10 minutes watching someone eating cheese .
Splurge
She really knows her stuff. Also surprisingly skinny for a “cheese expert”!
How the fuck do you become a cheese expert
people complaining on how this was not a blind taste test, wouldn't have got so much information from her if it was simply blindfolded and only tasted, everyone has their own taste buds and preference, she was telling us every details on how to define a cheese type, so we could choose either one within our budgets and taste preference without getting ripped off
Not sure why I loved this but I super did
The first flag on the left is an Irish flag. Haha. I thought it was from Italy  🇮🇹
Wait... the goat cheese wasnt 5x more expensive though more like 4.2x
I aspire to be this level of knowledgeable about cheese.
Very interesting and educational!
This was a waste of time. I could have told you, as a blah pastry chef, what was more expensive based on appearance. Lamesauce.
How the fuck she knew all that
You made a career out of eating cheese. You are a fucking genius, lady. I'm doing life so wrong.
Can you not tell us what the cheeses were or where they were from? It's a bit of a cock-tease to say something like "I know exactly where this fancy blue cheese is from because of the leaf, and its only from one specific place and its amazing celebration food" And then NOT tell us what it was from. This wasn't even a challenge, it was literally a woman standing there telling us straight up "This cheese is more expensive" and literally every single one was obvious to anyone who has had cheese other than American Sliced cheese in their life.
"i do know my stuff, no, just kidding"
In b4 this becomes a series.
How do you become a cheese expert
But do she like babybell?
eww.. I want to burn the rind goat cheese
Don't know why I watched all of this...but I enjoyed it. She knows her cheese
The most impressive thing in this video is all the knives she was using
Before I became vegan I never purchased anything but Parmigiano-Reggiano and I am far from Rich! But I would rather spend a lot of money for a little bit of something spectacular than a little bit of money for a lot of something meh. So I have less to eat but I eat better food even vegan. Alpine cheeses used to be my favorite cheeses. I now make my own vegan cheese at home and I have had non-vegans be really happy with it. I do a blue cheese I do have smoked cheese lightly sort of like a provolone and I do a good melting cheese.
i love when experts are knowledgeable but still humble about what they know. she clearly knew what she was talking about and she probably knew which cheese was which based on her observations but she wasn't like "ITS 100% THE CHEAPER ONE. IM POSITIVE"
2 things I know 4 sure.   1. Her breath must smell horrible lol.  2. She's gotta be constipated with eating all this cheese lol
this is stupid - should have used cheese of the same age and same type
I'm super glad she wasn't pretentious about being an expert in something. She just stated the facts and why she thought a cheese was more expensive. She even made a joke that she doesn't know what she's talking about :'D
Cheese expert a.k.a. worked in a deli for a 7.5 years a.k.a. me lol. I looooooooove cheese 😍🧀
who the fuck cares
Is there any reason to the different knives for different cheeses that she uses?
Amazing!!
Far out, if my calculations are correct that last cheese would cost $135 per kilogram in Australia... and thats just a straight conversion, I imagine the price would skyrocket with the cost of shipping it all the way down here. Fuck me. Interesting video though, good job.
this was super interesting ! i learned so much and now i wanna eat cheese lmao
I love how she pushed for people to support grass fed cows farmers. Corn fed cows should be left to Kobe beef producers in Japan. Cows are not supposed to eat grains. The fact that we support grain/corn fed bovine farming is sickening.
i swear the way she pronounces italian cheeses pisses me off as an italian
im watching a woman eat and talk about cheese but why do i feel so *inferior* ?
Fart at 1:18
Why are people complaining about blindfolding or if it should be purely a taste test? Do you want fake shit? They know a lot about cheese, it doesn't mean they have a god palette.
I could have picked these just by looking. B is more expensive on the third one. Its more rounded like hand made. Ps did this before she said anything
She is amazing! Love to see they have someone on here with real, refined knowledge!
i thought she was going to be annoying by the title, but this was actual entertaining and interesting
The Italy flag looks more like an Irish flag...
Is it just me or does the aged goat cheese scary?
I love how they use a variety of knives throughout the video 5:28 mini meat knife 7:19 swiss cheese knife 9:49 car part knife lol
What about Kraft singles?
Can't help but get the feeling that this challenge was slowballed. You can eyeball most of these and know which ones are not factory-made.
1:16 she smells really furiously
Anyone else hate this lady
I don't know if it's because I'm French, but I also guessed right, without even tasting them... x')
It would be better if a tiny cube of each cheese was cut to look the same, she was blind folded and it was just her taste and smell making the decision.  Also a little correction, the lady said "it takes a lot more sheep milk to make the same amount of cheese".  This is incorrect, as sheep milk is more concentrated than cows milk, it takes less of the same volume of sheep's milk to make the same amount of cheese.  Ten litres of sheep milk will make more cheese than 10 litres of cows milk, the only problem with sheep is that they don't produce a lot of milk.  A cow makes many times more milk than a sheep.
3:59 its 3.33 times as expensive, not 5 times. 4/4= 1$ per ounce. 20/6 =3.33 per ounce.
ew go vegan
Who has the time to be a cheese expert??? But I mean its really interesting
anyone notice that the first cheese is from Italy, but they used the Irish flag?
I'm no expert, but it was obvious and easy to tell which is older.
What was the name of the very expensive blue cheese?
So the darker ones are most expensive lol
Dark aged crystal more like fungus
They don't know Jack shit
I didn't not know that about the color nice learned something new
What I learned: crusty older cheese is more expensive
nothing beats good old aussie bega cheese
This was super ez mode.. there were clear identifiers which is more expensive..
Basically whichever looks worse is more expensive
What genius/moron thought "Hey you know what would make this cheese tastier? Mold."
This was actually really interesting
Fail test
Take a shot every time she says cheese or milk.
I guessed it and I got them right just by looks 😌😂
What has Ireland got to do with this ?  https://youtu.be/lR-oJvKJyUY?t=145
Y did I waste 11 mins on this?
What a charming lady! Fantastic video; thank you!
so uh.. she eats cheese and people pay her? dafuq
Impressive.
I bet if she showed you her bank account you would stop making fun of her.
Instead of giving just two of the same type of cheese, and making her determine which is the more expensive, why not make it harder?  Give her part of the cheese without the rind, simply have her determine if a cheese is expensive or not in a lineup of a few cheeses instead of two of the same style of cheese to be tested together.  The style this is conducted makes it easy for anyone never mind a cheese expert to choose correctly...
When you want to become a cheese specialist but your lactose intolerant....
Would have been funny to see her love one of the cheeses she sampled so much that they had to cut away why she pigged out :)
Well that was easy. Some of her pronunciation is dodgy for a cheese expert but I'm presuming that it's because she's American?
Her breath finna smell like a garbage can after all that
I feel like a cheese expert after watching this video
I guessed all of them correctly right away. If you know cheese, you know cheese. Cheese lover for life. #cheeseordie
I really like how respectful she was towards both versions of cheese, makes you feel less self-conscious about your choices like you would with a snobby "expert". Would love to see more :D
Are her eyes violet? They look like Elizabeth Taylor's in the thumbnail..
2:24 Seconds the flag looks more Ireland than Italia..  Think someone needs to listen to Sheldon for some Fun with Flags
Woah shocker a cheese expert knows her cheese!
The goat cheese has only about a $2 per ounce difference between expensive and cheap. The cheap one is about $1 per ounce and the more expensive one is about $2.33. I don't see why they had to change the unit of measurement for this one either.
0:09 dick on Cheese a
I think should have been done blindfolded. Also, at 4:00, you see that the prices aren't even for the same volume. Who measures prices per 4oz vs 6oz? The tester was even confused and did her math wrong. Just give us the apples to apples comparison.
I like how she wasn't all pretentious and snobby about the cheaper ones.
She probaly cannonrushes all the time
I'm so glad I watched an 11 minute video of a woman pointing out the obvious. I totally didn't guess everyone of these right before she even started talking about them.
Damn she’s a real cheese wiz
1:17 who farted there? Hm????
None of these were guessed by taste.  In other words save your money.
this is not just a taste test, it is an opportunity to teach people about cheese. that's probably why the rinds were left on. and why it wasn't blind.
Cheese expert pronounced goo-da which should be called ghoo-da
Moral of the story: the grosser the cheese looks, the more expensive it is.
why the irish flag beside the parmigiano reggiano 2:24
At what point do you say "I want to be a cheese expert"
As I am watching this I am hoping and praying she isn't lactose intolerant after all.
4:05 five times more expensive? I think your math is off a little bit
I could of guessed this and I'm not expert
I dont know why I watched this I hate cheese.
Talk about a fucking expert shit
Impressive expertise. One nitpick though: no EU subsidies in Switzerland... It is not part of the EU
It's crazy i fucking love cheese but cannot eat it raw unless in a sandwich
What a job.
This was so informative! Liz did an excellent job being concise with her explanations. I loved her insight!
Thought it was a funny video...till the american propaganda started. The EU helps their producers - so, how exactly does she taste the money :/
Maybe it's just my desktop. but why does the first A cheese says it's from Ireland?
They should have brought out Casu Marzu for her
SHES SO CUTE
This should've been a completely blind taste test because she's already made up her mind once she's seen the cheese.   There was a completely blind taste test for wine with supposed "wine experts" and the experiment showed that they actually couldn't tell which wines were the more expensive.   This is more of an eye test.
where you do work as a cheese expert
They shoulda made grilled cheeses and then gave it to her
They should have put  kraft American slice versus the Wal Mart version.. she might have been too Boujee to figure them out..Lol
2:45 Rind-the outside, rind-the outside...ok I'll leave now.
i could listen to her talk for hours
Wait... it’s NOT buzzfeed?? Lmao I just realized
😎
Thought this was a Buzzfeed vid until I actually started learning things. Loved it.
i loved the video but can i just say, if you're a cheese expert, learn to pronounce Parmigiano Reggiano. there are no j's in there.
take a shot every time she says cheese
So wine experts are full of shit, cheese experts know their shit. Got it
2:25 Didn't know Parmegiano-Reggiano came from Ireland
cheese is bacteria poop.
What is the expensive blue cheese called?
i cant even imagine the bacteria in her stomach from all the cheese,
Then what is the leaf packed cheese called?
cheese expert doesn't know how to pronounce parmigiano reggiano?
This was such a good video, and I love the woman you guys chose! She's so informative :)
Really informative, she clearly knows what shes doing. Great job!
this bitch really farted at 1:19
I must be a cheese expert...I guessed all of them right without even tasting them. Oh wait, it's just common sense that the older more distinguished looking ones are more expensive.
She knows her stuff
why does she look like a piece of cheese though
I don't even eat cheese and I still watch this shit
I'm no cheese expert but It wasn't really that hard to tell (just visually). Also, America is the worst country for cheese. They take cheese and make it bad.
Awkwardly using the Irish flag instead of the Italian flag for the reggiano. Awkwarrrrrrddddddd
This was free I could have told you the expensive ones Jesus.
Very informative. She really knows her cheeses 😊
I want her job. 😍🧀
That hot lady is cheesy! :)
Grass fed  😂😂 Wtf else the cows are supposed to eat ? That's why American cheeses are usually gross...
I have a favourite blue cheese, it's wrapped in grape peels and it's SO GOOD! A bit fruity and tangy to balance out the salt and fattiness. It's so delish but i can never remember the name of it.
"party cheese"
This was very interesting to me idk why
i live in switzerland, surrounded by mountains. we have many kinds of alpine cheese (austria does, too), sometimes with herbes, sometimes with pepper corns, spices, nuts, whatever xD  but at least she tried a gruyère
Anyone think she looks like the hot version of Cynthia Nixon?
Haha she said MOIST!
This is a great video! I wish they said what each one was, though I'm about 90% sure on all of them.
Wow an expert who really IS an expert.  Very fun to watch and informative.
She has my favourite job in the world!
I really enjoyed this episode. She was very lovely in explaining the differences. I like how she didn’t look down on the less expensive cheese, like some “experts” in other fields do.
Should have done it blindfolded, see if this bitch knows what's up then. If you spend half an hour reading about cheese, I'm sure anyone can guess which cheese is more expensive visually. Not that interesting.
by the power of elder cheese i shall grant you the tittle cheese prodigy good job young lad
I learned a lot. Thanks
Come o, I am not an expert, but that was not difficult to guess what cheese is more expensive!
She's really charismatic :)
At the feta part. So far ive guessed everyone correct based on looks alone. Boring af.
I love this video
I don't even like cheese but this was very intressing. Liz did a great job here.
I love her!
That rogue river blue at the end is so good. Wrapped in Syrah leaves macerarted in brandy, it is such a unique flavor for blue cheese
Blonde Sigourney Weaver
Omg I wanna be a cheese expert lol
But has she tried fumunda cheese
She looks like cheese
This was so fascinating :D god I love cheese lol
This made my intolerance to lactose flair up by just watching it
I love her! And the way she explains every single detail is just amazing. She really knows her stuff and is really excited to educate people. Love!
I wonder if there is an American who can pronounce Gouda correctly. It's just sad that an "expert" is butchering those names so hardcore.
omg I love her knowledge on the topic 😍😍
So many bats.
She's brilliant - really informative & entertaining! Well done!
When u can simply tell which one is expensive by look, there is no need for taste test
She looks like a discount Claire Dumphy.
This is honestly one of the best videos I've seen in a while. She was cool and humble and who doesn't love cheese.
i could have guess which one was more expensive without even eating it.. like wtf. Should have cut them without the rind.
Would you be my cheese wife?
The perfect woman doesn't exi-
This video is freaking amazing for someone who really appriciates cheeses!
Wow she knows her shit. Usually experts are pretentious but shes def an expert
1:18 a little cheese fart? 💨
basically the grosser it looks the better it is
I seriously don't you'd need to be an "expert" to get these they were so easy.  It would of been harder if it was a blind taste test, but even then it wouldn't be difficult.
You can obviously see which ones are more expensive
I am not a cheese expert, but I could have guessed The grosser looking one is more expensive rule of thumb guys!
Those are salt crystals not protein crystals....
I really really enjoyed watching this video. It was relaxing, entertaining and educational!
Cant wait to be a pizza expert
I love those little cheese crystals. @.@ So yummy. ^_^
I like her she’s smart
Shes awesome! I learned alot 👌 But nite i really want cheese 😭
who is she
She cute
This was way to easy.  I could tell right when they showed them which is more expensive and I'm no expert. The rougher less smooth looking is always more expensive. Feta's the only exception, but if I tasted it I probably would have gotten that one as well. I do like her though..she didn't say one negative thing , like "ewww, this is not anything like the high quality cheese I prefer" or anything pretentious.
when you think about it cheese is kinda nasty, this would be the worst job in the world for me
Damn this bitch knows her cheeses.
This came on my up next and just from hearing her voice I thought it was Winona Ryder speaking
if i ate this much cheese at once my stomach would explode and i would shoot fire for days....
The reveal cards should’ve had more informations on them, this video made me crave that fancy leaf wrapped cheese without telling me where I can get some, it’s like showing me porn then punch me in the nuts.
This woman knows her cheese
that flag of italy looks more like an ireland flag
It was pretty obvious which was more expensive. I could tell first few seconds
Anyone could tell the difference
Some people have too much money. Fifty dollars for a lb of cheese? Gross
This feta... All I can taste is salt. Then she says to buy that one. Fuck that noise.
This was just great! Loved it.
Hey guys lets do a test which is more expensive IPHONE OR NOKIA. HMMM well the phone looks like its the mnore expensive one. HUH, looks like you were write thanks expert. 3 year old can get the same friggin result. MAKE A BETTER TEST Epicurious. Gettin worse than buzzfeed.
What am I doing here? I'm vegan.
Liz seems like she'd be fascinating to talk to.
Plot twist: she's lactose intolerant
I waited this entire video for her to say what her favorite cheese is.🙁🧀❓
She uses ''Maybe'' , ''Could be'' , ''I'm guessing "alot  , this makes me lead that she has no clue what the cheeses are and depending visually on the cheeses
Whoever has a kid with this woman better name the kid Nacho!
I loved this video! As a relatively naive cheese eater it was interesting to watch the different identification methods. I actually appreciated her expert insight.   You earned a subscriber!
There is such a thing...
Kindergarten Teacher: “What do you want to be when you grow up?” “Princess”  “Astronaut”  “Cheese Expert”  .........
I don't know why y'all are complaining this isn't "blindfolded", there's more to a cheese's price than how it tastes. The video is that she's comparing THE PRICES of two cheeses of one type, not what cheese it is. It's actually more educational especially for consumers that, to tell apart an expensive from a cheap cheese, is to look beyond what it tastes like.   A blindfolded format would've been more appropriate for a "guess what cheese?" or something. Stop complaining!
I was waiting for the mozarella :(
Liar,i know blue cheese smell like farts
I really like hearing her talk about cheese.
O
That last cheese looks like Rogue River Blue Cheese (from Oregon.) It's wrapped in pear brandy soaked fig leaves. So good!
This is definitely one where I'd like to have a list in the description of the cheeses. (And I'd love a rematch comparing cheeses within a brand. Some of the smaller brands can still have a huge range, and that would be way more tough to determine price. Or, of course, throw in WSU Cougar Gold for the fun of it.)
Like, all I taste is salty tears.
I’m jealous. I think I found my dream job
I thought the Cabrales cheese was the only blue cheese that got leaves on the outside.
Why do I want mold in my cheese? Genuinely curious
best job ever
Idk why but I could just keep watching her do this
wow taylor swift's dayjob is interesting
I love how she talked about the merits of each cheese and didn’t just put down the less expensive cheeses. Now I have lots more cheese knowledge!
An American cheese expert 😂😂😂😂😂 👉🏻 No ...she didn’t really tell you more than anyone going grocery shopping around here 😉 #France
I was right about all of these cheeses as well without having to taste or smell it, so either I am a cheese expert as well or someone in this video is talking out of their ass.
Paying more for a cheese that tastes like a crayon with little salt or sugar crystals in it as she describes ? NO, thank you.
I think those that complain about the visual 'hints' she was getting are missing the point. It's not about the competitive aspect of guessing, but rather about learning (rinds and visual included), so you can make the best choice and try to identify these by yourself. At least that was my takeaway.
I really want cheese now...
7:33 7:23 why did she try the B one twice?
Really enjoyed this! Would love to see more cheese oriented videos from Liz.
You don´t need to be an expert to know that the eldest cheese is the most expensive one...
Okay so whatever is more aged is more expensive
Why is my lactose intolerant ass watching this at 3 am
What was the alpine b cheese
This lady is a cheese computer.
I don't even like cheese and I still watched this....
no dickcheese? come on
I think this is the first “blank expert” video where the person actually know their shit instead of just using complex artsy fartsy terms to describe the food
so totally off topic item here:  A $16/lbs cheese vs a $46/lbs cheese.  You take lots more time n effort to make the more expensive one and the lesser expensive one would be more easily made! At the end, the sales both end up similarly! It depends where your passion is at.
Comparing fresh to aged cheese isnt really fair. Significantly aged cheese will be more expensive. This isnt even a blind taste test. I could tell at a glance which was which.
She is pretty
“What did you major in college” “Oh I️ majored in cheese”
You do know your stuff!!
Blind tasting would've been fun. Also, a flag on each would help, only on some. Lastly the names of cheese would be awesome. I saw Rogue River Blue, looked like Pleasant Ridge Reserve beating non cave aged Gruyere and the goat looked like Montchevre against the Coupole from Vermont Creamery, I could be wrong. At least name the winners to promote the cheese. These are all thoughts but I love the video and cheese education. Much love
cheese is my favorite food and this lovely lady is blowing my mind!
Please make this a series but with different food and experts every time and maybe even do a blind taste test
She got crazy with the cheese whiz when she evaluated these cheeses
She got crazy with the cheese whiz when she evaluated these cheeses
Ironic. I'm eating cheese as I'm watching this. I knew that was Parmesan when I saw it. I've subscribed.
You've been a really good and informative and welcoming host :D
she was delightful
Needs to be blindfolded!
she did actually better vs "wine testers"... those fools are fooled easily
The analysis aspect was super cool but it’s not really her guessing what is the most expensive because she has all the information to guess that just by seeing them
I love the alpine cheese, i loveeeeeee them, unfortunately i no longer live in France and cant get it in Panama 😭
Blind part in the title was a bit misleading. I mean I picked all the same cheese’s she did except the feta. Just by picking the shitty’est oldest looking one. I wonder if this expert was truly doing a blind taste ,could she really have guessed the “most” expensive? Hey man if it tastes good eat it. Perspective is everything.
Some of these comments seem fake
This was way too easy. I'm lactose intolerant so I can't eat a lot of cheese, and even I could tell watching on my screen which ones were the more expensive.
"O-REGEEANO"   LMFAO... FUCK THIS DUMB BITCH
Really ? Am I the only one who's gonna say it ? She is hot af!
I really want some cheese right now...😭
So knowledgeable. Blown away by the amount of information presented. Great video, the best I have seen of this genre!
I love how she pretends she doesn't know exactly which cheese is in front of her. Even I could tell from a mile away that the more expensive cheeses that were not parm or feta were Coupole, Pleasant Ridge Reserve, and Rogue River Blue. Really educational video though, especially for those not familiar with cheese. Liz has some great books too.
I like her. I like this video. But I fucking love cheese.
Not gonna lie, the expensive cheese looks like it’s nasty as shit
Expensive cheese taste like shit and cheap cheese tastes good
Am I the only one wondering why a cheese expert exists
a good video made incredible by the level of expertise of the host
So easy, Rule: The chesse that looks more shitty is the better one, So damn ez.
Americans plastic
Thank you for the awesome content, I really enjoyed watching this. Of course I subscribed. Keep up the good work!
The first one was so easy
I thought it said chess expert lol
damn, i'm only a High schooler and i could tell the difference. where do i sign up to be a "cheese expert"?
i'm watching people eat cheese... What the hell has my life gone to?
1:12 Is "salty crayon" actually supposed to taste good? 1:43 Why?  Manufacturers lobbying government to enact restrictions, then marketing to snobs. 6:32 You buy one over the other because of grass-fed snobbery. 7:25 She ate from B both times (or the video editor screwed up).
How do u even become a chesse expert?
Whichever looks the oldest is normally the most expensive.
I loved it!
The ugly ones are expensive
For gods sake learn how to say ‘parmigiano reggiano’
Great video
Very well analyzed, very educated.  Great work!
Did you hear de fart in 1:16 hahahaha
Watch my tour in the fish market
That “I know my stuff” comment was funny.
Damn it the thumbnail looked like Grace Helbig
She’s very well educated, great video
I did not come here to learn what the hell im on thanksgiving break
This is a pretty good video, except for the fact that the cheeses were not identified. I'm especially in knowing what the American Alpine style grass fed cheese was.
This was an amazing video. I need more like this.
I can listen to her say "parmigiano-reggiano" forever
This was an awesome and extremely informative video! No gimmicks, which is what I thought I would be when I clicked on it.
I have no Idea how I ended up here but I now feel the urge to eat a big piece of Roquefort :D
Why wasn't this done blind folded?
If you are an expert please learn how to pronounce Parmigiano-Reggiano correctly.
Make her do this blind folded...
great video
Her face 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍forgot the reason what the video was about
I wanna see cheese novices try this. That would probably be more interesting. This seemed too easy.
Should have worn the glasses.
Nice *cheese* knife.
I want her job! Also great video!
like the explaination
Cheese stinks
Nice
That was great!
i had an expensive cheese on a wednesday night once. totally threw off my chi.
This video is everything I want. I'd love more educational videos like this.
Woah not just a gimmick video she actually explains a lot about it, chill, honest, and doesn't sugarcoat anything with BS, cool! Need more videos like this
i love the concept for this video... more please
Am a cheese expert in eating:)! I love chesses too! My fave is Brie, gorgonzola, camambert, mobier...etcs! Burrata is one of the best too!
I will say, Gruyere is what Swiss cheese wishes it could be. Seriously. And regards Parmagiano - Parmagiano Regiano for me please. And none of the crud in the plastic jar.
I loved Liz and the way she talkes..but...I'm not even such a cheese consumer and I would have been able to say the exact same things, and just by watching the images I would have guessed them. this one was super easy, c'mon..
im cheeeeezed
I thoroughly enjoyed this taste test so much.  But I have to say,  my mouth was watering at each new pairing.  Great job!!!!
Do a cheese , snack and wine picnic video
Leaving the rind on the cheese felt like it gave it away the majority of the time. It's like having a sommelier taste test wines, but having the bottle right there in front of them. I'd have enjoyed it more if they'd been made to simply blind taste the cheese.
