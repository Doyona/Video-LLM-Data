Wonderful video. Thank you!
Half of the times I just watched you, you're too sweet. Napkin should've double fabric or just a single layer of fabric work absence fine! Is cotton napkins are just handkerchief!! What's the difference between hand towels, napkins and handkerchiefs!!! Please reply, it'll help me a lot
Perfect! The best of all! Thank you so much, you just got another “ fanllower”
Thanks
Great information Just watched your video. Thankyou Could you use 2 layers of batting?
I hate hand sewing so I used some Heat Bond hemming tape.  I find that the 1/4 inch is very hard to catch by sewing and I like to sew a good quarter inch around so very easy for the fold to come undone.  I would truly like to have your comment on this practice….will ùi regret doing that?
Great tips on doing the placemats thank you! What is the best batting to use ? Cotton or 80/20?
I see this is from way back in 2014, but I'm glad to have found this tutorial. Thanks! It's really simple, well described, and fun to make.
Very Nice 👌👌👌 Radhe Krishna 🌹🙏👍👍🔔Pin me
beautiful ideas always  lynette
pretty bracelet 😊
Thank you , I love the way you teaching 👍👏🏻  I will start to make it now 😀
They are wonderful! If you quilt them how do you keep the stitching from coming out? Back stitch on the edge top stitch?
How do you make a Bible bag
Excellent instructional video. You are good teacher too.
The afternoon project....I have been trying to get my placemats right for a week and then I found this video. Thank you sooooooooo much!! You really simplified it and now I feel less incompetent.
Nice class thank you.
Hello Laura.  Hoping I can still get a comment on this older post.  I am able to make corners, but when I turn them,  I always have a problem getting a straight edge between corners.  The distance between corners "sags" for lack of a better word, and the corners look like rabbit ears.  How can I get the sides to be straight?  I've tried pressing the seams open before turning but it doesn't work.  There must be a way (???).  Thank you.
Oh my goodness. I love learning something new!  Thank you
ياريت يترجم للعربي الاستفاده اكبر ونفهم
U r so perfect
I want to make placemats with cotton fabric . I want to turn them and sew the edge, then a second topstitch 1/4 from that.  Should I use a thin batting?  or a stiff interfacing?  What about double sided fusible?  I want to be sure it washes well.
Thanks for the beautiful video. Now my question is, did you do the quilting stitch before or after side stitching?
Thank you for your tutorials. I have just made 6 table napkins and table cloth for this years table.
Very nice video and directions!
Thank you so much!  So helpful
Thoroughly explained with very important tips provided.  Thank you. Great video.
Can i use fleece instead of batting? TIA
I love watching you sew easy but I never can find the free patterns
Thank you for the video! I am going to try making these! For quilting the place mats...do you just add the extra stitching? I've never quilted before and wasn't sure how you did that portion???
Thank you so much! I sewed four place mats in a few hours minus the napkins and it turned out beautiful! :)
Wow! Good tips/ ideas on sewing batting to the place mats! Thank you!
Beautiful napkins and placemats.  When making the placemats, is fusible batting OK?  Thanks.
These are wonderful!  Thank you for the lesson!
Thanks for the good video.At first, I like your voice:>  I can't decide whether I need to use batting or interfacing for placemats.  Or both?  My fabrics are  cotton.
Beautiful
Wow, what a great tutorial, you’re so talented.  Not everyone can talk and show what you’re doing and keeping us interested at the same time.  Great job.  Thank you so much!
thanks for the tutorial, i always wonder if it's cheaper to DIY - i like how i can customize the look and love the double sided! newbie question - i love the quilted look you showed at the end, do you have a tutorial to show how it's done so neatly?  thanks very much!
Those look nicer than what you could buy at Macy's
Genius tip for easy trimming of the batting.  Why didn't i think of that before!
Hello, loving this video - what size fabric have you used for the place mats please?
how about shrinkage... the batting always shrinks more than the 100% cotton .... is there a solution for that.?
Thank you for explaining what happens if corners are not trimmed.  What do you think of trimming back corners a second time, trimming the freshly cut seam allowance from 45 degrees to approx 22 degrees?  And pressing to set stitches?  Terrific tip flipping the ruler to trim the batting über close to the sea.  Thanks again!
Sensacional!!!
all you did was be verbal in explaining - I  am a newbie...wouls have understood  more by physically seeing it done!
First of al I would like to say I love Jacqueline Kennedy she was a class act for sure and I think you are the Jackie of sewing  Your projects are well explained, your voice is very soothing and everything straight to the point s million thumbs up 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Thank you loura from India 🇮🇳
Do u quilt after u top stitch?
You’re awesome!! Tnx
Hi! Am I glad I have found this tutorial! 😎🌸 Thanks a lot Laura!
Like your tips
I'm obviously not a seamstress; however, I want to try this!  I am VERY inspired.  Your directions are so amazing.  I do have one question though ... you said that you prefer to hand stitch the opening.  I don't see you do this and I'm confused.  *feeling dumb* as I don't sew much at all.  How do I get the opening closed??  Thank you SO much for helping this beginner.  *hugs*
Nice..
Thank you. BEAUTIFUL TUTORIALS. 😃👍👍👍👍🌷
OM Goodness ... YOU have the most beautiful silver/grey/white hair I've ever seen.  WoW !!!
I am learning a lot from your tutorials!  I must add that your nails look beautiful in every video I've watched!
Thanks Laura,these are lovely and I will be making some.
Thanks a lot Laura! 😎🌸
Did you square the material of each square first?
How does one measure for wedge shaped placements for a round table?
Hellow so ellegant lady from Youtube,  just to say hellow from South América.
Excellent i love your videos
Smart ! 👑. Beautiful  place mat &napkins,  thanks for sharing. 😁
I was browsing thru my subscriptions and saw your instructional video for Christmas placemats.  Having/making placemats never occurred to me until I watched your video. You inspired me!  2 days before Christmas & I started making eight (8)  placemats.  I bought some beautiful poinsettia material & some black material (with a slight pattern) for the back.  You speak and describe yourself so clearly.  Thank you for making the instructions so easy to follow. I made eight (8) placemats in approx.  Six (6)  hours. I got them on my table in the nick of time. "WE" got so many complements on them. I didn't have enough time to make the napkins. Those will also be on my table next year! I made sure I sprayed the placemats with a fabric sealer. I didn't want any stains on my newly made mats.
Good video and good info and tips thank you for Sharing!!! Liz x
Thank you for posting!
Could you use a fusible batting and not press until all sewn and turned out?
Beautiful succinct directions!  Thank you!
Those are beautiful
Do you need 1.25 yards of both fabric? Or .75 of each?
Thank you for sharing such an easy project for beginners!  I am definitely going to subscribe to this channel
I love the idea of changeable projects gifts for birthday, housewarming or  backyard picnics... These are so beautiful with many possibilities. I am a beginner sewer & these are just the confidence builder I can try.  Peace n Luv, Jean
Do you wash the fabric prior to sewing?  I've made mine and they look pretty but didn't wash  and afraid they won't be absorbent.  Should I wash now prior to using?
Do you prewash your fabric before starting these 2 projects?  Thank you for creating thus easy tutorial.   I'm going to make these for Christmas gifts.  :-D

Great tip on cutting the batting perfectly!  Worked out great! Thank you for sharing your talent with us via video!
Should I quilt before I topstitch?
So you need 1.25 of each fabric to make 4 napkins and 4 placemats?  Is this correct?
Awesome video. You made it look so easy. I'm going to try this tomorrow. Thank you
I can't make out the type of machine you are using.  I've not sewed in a very long time, but now that I'm retired, I think this would be a good time to pick it up again.  You are so easy to understand and have so many wonderful ideas.
Hi Laura, you are so clear and uncomplicated.  Thank you for your tutorials, I have learned so much .  Jules from Australia
Wonderful...this is truly an awesome way to do placemats, I just have one question, when you don't quilt them, how do they come out when you wash them?
love this, I'm going to replace the batting with PUL & make placemats for our messy furbabies food/water dishes & probably my toddlers also.
Thank you for all your wonderful teaching videos. I especially appreciate when you specify the correct needle to use. You are so talented!
Hi,  what type of fabric do you recommend for napkins? thanks
Thank you Laura for all your wonderful tips and projects. It is all very much appreciated.
I just took a bit of a bigger seam and all is good!
I just reviewed this video to make my Canada Day placemats, ah yes, don't cut into the fabric which is exactly what I did, but was able to repair it easily enough.
You're tips were great!!!!   Thank you.
I was wondering why you didn't quilt the placemats until I saw the end of the video, but why did you wait to quilt them after you were finished?  I would be afraid that you would see the back stitch at the beginning and end of each line.  Would it not be better to quilt to the top fabric first before turning?
This does not have anything to do with the placemats. I love the quilt behind you. Have you done a tutorial on that pattern? It almost looks like bow ties. I am new to quilting and think i could manage that pattern, maybe?
aun que no entiendo lo q dice me gusta mucho sus tutoriales son muy lindas sus labores...
I love the placemats and napkins..how much material will I need to make these?  Thanks
Thanks....really enjoyed this.......
Wonderful tutorial and very helpful tips! Thanks for sharing :)
Oh, thanks Ms. Laura..I Love that. you are the bomb com. years girlfriend
I love your videos! You make everything come out looking high end. Thanks for sharing your expertise.
thank you for your good instructions.,
Thank you for a great tutorial with details. That ruler trick is neat! Will have to try that. Do you prewash fabric for napkins or wash after they  are done. Will the gold metallic thread hold up to washer & dryer? or better to hand wash & line dry?
Thank you for this tutorial.  I enjoy subscribing to your channel, your instructions are very clear!.  Thanks again.
Thank you so much 😊 that was a great 👍 tutorial
Great job. They look perfect. Very easy to follow tutorial and good tips.
This is awesome, may i ask how we can reach you for some inquiries?
So nice
I love your teaching style! You explain everything very well. Now I know I can make these for my daughter for the holidays! Thanks!
Hallo Laura, tolle Idee das zurückschneiden des Volumenvlieses, alles toll erklärt, vielen Dank!😊👍 LG Heike
Just finished making the placemats,your instructions are so easy to follow,Thankyou for all the help given to me via your tutorials🐣
Those are so pretty and I love the tip about the batting! Thank you Laura!
Thank you for the placemat  program.  It gave me more ideas for Christmas gift giving.
thank yoy its' awesome! hugs from Iraq
Yeah, just to let you know I tried to click on the fabric/packet one and It came up error on page so you might want to check into that.
Thank you! It´s awesome! Hugs from Brazil!
really like your videos .. you teach well
My goodness! You explained that very well!
I'm very new to sewing-thanks! I think I can do this.
I really love all of your videos.  Your method of teaching is so very pleasing.  Thank you.
beautiful napkins and placemats, wonderful useful easy to understand tips!!
Laura thank you for your fabulous tips and tricks.  If I want my placemats to continue to have a crisp look without a lot of shrinkage/puckering I know I can pre wash the fabrics.  But what about the batting?  If I use cotton batting it is sure to get that wrinkled look.  Is it safe to use a poly batting in placemats? Are there other bats that would have less change to them?  Again, love your videos and I always enjoy getting the notification from YouTube that SewVeryEasy has uploaded a new clip!!!
Beautiful!
great video. Was so helpful. Been wanting to make some. Thx
i need to the video that shows quillows for fleece material for pocket pleass.
very nice, and seems to be a quick project. altough i love bindings ;-)
I am starting to sew and was interested in the cutting mat you would suggest for me
Should I quilt it first then do the edge top stitching or the other way around?
great tips! i needed that
That was a great tip for cutting the batting! Thanks.
Love watching your videos. Only one suggestion...make more. :-)
This tutorial made me decide to subscribe.  My mother can sew with her eyes closed but she is in MD and I am in Alaska so I wanted to show her that I can do something.  I wanted to make her placemats and napkins.  I think she will like the reversible look.  Thank you for making it so easy.
Hi, im planning on making these in time for Christmas. What thickness of batting should I use?
Perfect and so easy!
Thanks for all the great tips!
I have subscribed and I am going to make the placemats and napkins and I will also be making the blanket pillow. I have enjoyed all the videos that I have been watching because I have learned a lot from watching you. Keep the videos coming because they are very helpful and useful.
love the tutorial. thank you
I love your videos, they are so much fun and helpful. I can't wait for more.
Love your trick with the ruler to trim the batting without touching the fabric!  BRILLIANT
As always, a great tutorial. Your teaching delivery is so calming and so easy to follow - so many tutorials assume knowledge that some of us simply don't have! Many thanks.
Thanks for wonderfully easy projects and ideas
hi femalemart1..the place mats start out at 14"x18" and the napkins are 11"square and use a 1/4" seam allowance. But you can make them any size that you want:)have fun!
Can you give the sizes for both please?  Thank you.
thank you for sharing, these are beautiful. Your tutorial was easy to follow and understand. I look forward to follow and watch more of your tutorials.
thank you!! Very good!!
Laura - Great tip on how to trim the batting.
I have a quick question -- you talked about pressing the seam allowance into the napkin to make it lay right after turning it right-side out.  What do you mean by pressing the seam allowance into the napkin?  Thanks!
Thank You for the batting tip!  50+ years sewing & I learned a new thing today :-) !
beautiful. gonna try this soon.
Thank you for sharing your expertise! You are a great instructor - I love your videos - you gave some great tips for cutting the batting and making the corners sharp. I'm going to make a set of both the napkins and placemats - while I watch your video.
Hi thank you for sharing.  its amazing and informative.
Great tutorial! You gave some excellent tips on trimming out the batting and pressing seam allowances to make for sharper edges and corners, things I have not seen in all my years of sewing.
Thanks SO much for this video! :)  I never knew you could use a ruler to trim off the batting like that! :) GREAT tip! :)
I really enjoyed your video! Thank you...now I shall try this, of course, with  your video close by so I can check to make sure I am doing well...
These are great.  Thank you for showing how to do this.
You make everything feel do-able.  Thank you for your video, I've subscribed.
I learn at least one useful tip from you every single time I watch a video. Thank you SO much for your great videos.
This is awesome! I just started sewing and once I get better (I'm taking lessions) I will make this for my mom, Great job!
Great tutorial! Thank you!!!
Enjoyed the video.  Are the instructions so they can be printed out?
