This is a very strange video.
Omygosh!!! I just made this and taste just like the real labna yoghurt soo delicious!! You guys are incredibly gifted so creative I loved watching you all as a family. You guys are funny and have a beautiful vibe! Thank you for sharing ❤️😘❤️
What is the raw probiotic used?  How do you open the coconut shell and scoop out the coconut with somewhat ease?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What kind of probiotic do I use? I want a good one with active live cultures.
Haram asf
Love your sister...she is ridiculously funny
💝✨️Thank you✨️💝
I don't believe a probiotic should be blended. Great video 👍
I made it. It was good! I put blueberries and honey 🫐🍯
As soon as I find the coconuts I’ll make this
This is the strangest video I've ever seen.
Thanks so much for sharing!!
I hung out in my teens late teens with ladies from Kuwait and fact Bibi Al Sabah princess of Kuwait... And other ladies from Kuwait that came to go to school in California... And I love Middle Eastern yogurt lebna... Used to only be able to get it in the '80s in San Francisco so we'd have to drive to the city from north... But well worth it have to try this new recipe God bless peace be with you
Vegan probiotics?
What an irritating trio.
Why use the store bought probiotics, just leave the coconut mixture out in a warm covered with a cheese cloth place overnight.
Where can I find the probiotics? Sorry if you have answered this already.
You look just lovelyyyy...
♥️🇱🇧♥️ I'm from Lebanon
Love this love from jordan
this is my favorite video. so much fun. stay healthy! i take a dose of sunshine from this channel during winter time
❤❤❤...
I am Arabic and I am loving your mothers Arabic accent
Beautiful
♥️♥️♥️Awesomeness, you all are!!!♥️♥️♥️
Very nice
OMG! This is was a real treat!! Thank you Habibis!!! 💕
Thanks for the recipe
When making using probiotics, metals kills the benefit. Wood spoon and glass.
A lot of weird smiling
Less teath please.
Your mom looks like your sister lol
you guys are so ca-yuuute
How much does this make just wondering. Trying to go more raw
Hi Kristina How long can this last in the refrigerator
You guys are SOOOooooooo CUTE!
They’re so cut lol
.......did she say .......pus ?   : - /
🤗It's amazing how all 3 of you guys look just a like...
Oh my goodness the Dorkiness  ...love it. Typical family like mine. Thank you for sharing time with your lovely Mama and Sister <3
I like the lifegenerators yogurt better, They don’t use lemon and he uses    Puradyme products, They tested the strains and it’s it’s great
Love mom 😊💗
Hi is this same at saudi laban and were can buy the himalayan salt and vigan probiotic thanks beautiful lady
why are they smiling weirdly.. they seem weird.. so weird..
I love yogurt but couldn’t find many that are dairy free. THANK YOU FOR THIS ✨
your sister is disgusting, don't film her plz.
Sweet sisters..bring more (lebanese recipes) on....
what's the lemon for?
😂 the look you and your sister have with your mom.
Man your sister looks like your twin. I thought she was you just a bigger
What is a vegan probiotic? Thanks...
YOU R SO FUNNY
What's up with Moms dogs hanging out?
And how many cups
Can I use shredded coconut??
3:29 lol omg so cute mom kicked into mommy mode, and Kristina was like 🤦🏾‍♀️
Hey Kristina,  Earlier today I purchased a four ounce coconut yogurt from my local health food store for $3.25, that had numerous thickers and additives.  I will NEVER do that again.  Thanks for such an easy and lovely looking recipe.
💓💞💕💜💛💚💙💕💞💓
Omggg the smiles and grins are so psychotic!! Are they mental? What the frick were they doing? Also they put the fat one in the middle hahah to balance out they really do look like they're from a weird cult with freaky smiles
Can you use liquid probiotic ( like coconut kefir) to make this yogurt recipe?
Edit out the first two minutes...get to it!
Can't wait to try this!!😍🤗🤗
I’m so addicted to Labne! I will give this a good college try
I must say, I'm excited for this recipe.
Hey. Do you know how to make the yoghurt more characteristic of cows milk? Less coconutty flavour and more creamy and neutral.
This is what you get when you get three ladies in the kitchen
Can't wait to try this!
i didn't know that you were lebanese!!! i'm lebanese too!!! i'm definetly going to try this laban recipe!
U GUYS ARE SO CUTE!
Hi, can we replace the lemon juice with other fruits?
i never knew you were lebanese. love your recipes! thanks for this x
Why so much excitement??? It's just coconut yogurt 😒. These vegans be acting hella extra
Thanks for the recipe can I use any kind of probiotics
💞💞 Thanks for sharing 🇹🇹
I'm definitely trying this recipe!
Bianca is gorgeous!!
Kristina is orange. She needs to cut down on the carrots. Lol
More videos with your beautiful family, please!!!
Gosh wot did bianca have for breakfast ?? herbal yogurt !! shes feeling herself way tooo much !!ahaah anyways always happy to see happy people ! and this was in abundance
Wow, you are all so beautiful!!! Yummy recipe💙
Three beautiful ladies,  and such gorgeous hair too!!
2:08
Such a beautiful and happy family! Will try this as soon as I find some vegan probiotics.... :)
It's love at first sight everytime with Kristina
Can this be made with almond milk. I don't like coconut at all.
Hi Kristina, where do you buy vegan probiotics for your yogurts?
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
The look your sister and mom gave when you said people in the U.S. put yogart on their cereal and smoothies was hilarious 😂😂😂
Where are u from Kristina??
I thought Kristina didn't consume salt. She mentioned it in a video that she made on top 5 foods she doesn't eat and salt was one of them
I'm half Lebanese! It's nice to see a video in English, from Lebanese people. You don't see that often!😊
Beautiful family
What is young coconut?
Love your videos and beautiful personality love to you and your family
You crazy ladies.....such good energy emanating from the 3! I enjoyed watching the chemistry among the 3 of you! Thanks for a great recipe.
Kristina I am new to your channel and I just subscribed.  I am so excited to have found your channel. Can you recommend a vegan probiotic?  I have been searching for so long and I can't find a good quality probiotic.
Te daría 100 dedos arriba... Pero sólo me deja 1
Do we have to use the probiotic? If not, will the yogurt come out the same?
Decided to comment recipe because I wrote it for myself anyway!   Coconut yogurt   -Meat from two young coconuts.  Add about 1 - 1 1/2 cups of water , less for thicker yogurt and more for thinner yogurt -Juice from 1 lemon  -Add 1-2 capsules of probiotics  -Blend until smooth  -Cover with plate and then towel in a glass container , let it sit for 24hrs on counter. 🥥🥥  Comment if I missed anything !
★★★★★ Kitchen Tools 1. Nutramilk http://thenutramilk.com/   let me know it you like this tool
I love hearing Kristina speak Arabic I knew she was Lebanese when I first time saw her videos she looks it alot as well.
So nice to meet your family  !
so beautiful! ty
Your three are so beautiful
lol. you guys had me laughing!!! cant wait to try this ...thanks!
I love your family...we'd love to see them feature again in future videos
Can you make raw vegan bashir? I love that ice cream!!
Really nice teeth
Why are y’all smiling so much tho
I don't know what I enjoyed more, the live recipe or the extra live family. Lol you all are beautiful inside and out.
BMW
I am going to have to watch this more than once missed the recipe the first time coz you guys are so funny and cute together...love your work!
Thanks a lot for this recipe, hugs!
Okay ALL that smiling is kinda creeping me out but I love her tho
If I don't have young coconut ? Howe I can make yougurt ??
Really loved the video I really wanna go fully raw. I stopped eating meat eggs and fish but I’m still struggling with dairy products
wow kristina what a sweet family! all of you are amazing!
I wish i have relationship like this.. :( glad you have.
OMG... I love your sister.... she is hilarious!
liked and subscribed.
Love it!! I did it and its almost ready
I don't have Instagram 🍍
You can also put the yogurt in a very small hole strainer and when the liquid is strained you have cheese
Still peddling the infoWars products? lol
This looks delicious. I am subscribed and gave a thumbs up! Keep up the great content!
Aw. Love it! Here in Philippines "laban" means fight. Haha nice :)
Looks so amazing 😍
Aww! Precious family! Blessings!
I love ❤️ you recipe ! @FullyRawKristina
@moenusair
Your sister is so funny! I am very interested to try this recipe, thanks for sharing.
Looks delicious.
No surprise your sister is gorgeous too!
Nothing new here lol. You should look up Lou Corona's almond/coconut yogurt.
Hi Christina, I enjoy watching your video. I very well explain thanks for putting all these different videos.
I don't have Instagram. :-( What a beautiful family you all have.
I thought leban wasn’t just a Lebanese yogurt
Beautiful loving family!  Thank you for this share.
Finally yogurt with no soy I love it ❤️
Jahnes love Kristina, can you please tell us what Vegan probiotics you recommend? I am trying to find one right now but it's difficult because probiotics have live cultures. Thanks for the recipe. Blessed love.
love your'r recipes
beautiful inspiring women emboding their Goddesses
too goofy!
You have a lovely family, God bless you
One thing. I would add the probiotic AFTER blending and stir in with a spoon, as the blending may destroy a good number of the living probiotics. Just a thought. Otherwise, great videos, love it!
Leban isn't lebanese, it's arabic for yogurt. Please educate yourself on terminology.
Is this traditionally a vegan yoghurt or did you change it vegan? I add Greek yoghurt to my smoothies so I may try using this... On the occasion of course, coconuts are very expensive (that and I don't really know how to get meat out the coconut)
I think I understand Kristina better when I see how her family members are 😋
you guys are hilarious in this video
Do you have to use the probitics? You all are so beautiful!!
Can you make a video on how to save leftover food from earlier meals for later usage?
does your hair have that wave naturally Kristina? or is there something you do to get it like that?
We are going to make it tomorrow look good
Thanks for sharing this.  We make this pretty regularly and LOVE it, but its just so nice to see you with your family in this video.  The closeness and love very much shows. Thanks for sharing them with us. ❤❤ Sending aloha.
Kristina's tone when she talks to her audience is like when most people talk to puppies...
What are you on guys  What ever you are on I want some of it Since when you use labaneh with cereal or salad, you ruined it And there is a difference between laban to eat which is for lunch with rice or Laban to drink with lunch too or labaned which is with thyme or zataar for breakfast or dinner Ufff
Really good I like Is gert how do you make
yummy
Aw so sweet to have your beautiful Mom and sister and you're beautiful too! This looks delicious!!!!😊
Beautiful family 😍

Hey Christina.  I love your recipes and the information you share comes from a pure place.  However, I was linked to another video that led me to wonder about some of the advice.  It was a video link about B12.  It made me wonder if you could start sharing some of the research into things you say in the videos.  Is your experience based on research or your own experience.  This is not to discredit your experience.  I'm still subscribed because I think the overall message you are trying to share is a positive one.
🍉🍊🍌🍇🍒🍅🍍🥑🍑🥒🍌🍓🌽🍠
Kristina is always saying how good her recipes are at the end of almost all her videos. So should I make a video of me actually taste testing her recipes to see if they are actually as good as she says it is?
It look fun
Wow!! This is an amazing must try recipe. Thanks for sharing!
Your sister is sooo funny🤣🤣
Okay girls, you need to rename this Lebanese Gushing- you girls are just so gushy in this one. Looks great when can I come over for breakfast? LOL Blessings!

🍊🍋
Sweet and incredible Kristina, first thank you for inspiring the world and I it bIetter. I am following you for a while now and I just want to tell how much … I love you. Today I am contacting you for a special request. I am actually working on an article on the theme "the Raw Miracle" for the next publication of the first magazine about raw living food and abundance in France, named "Le Chou Brave". They are gaining in notoriety thanks to its viral video about a famous naturopath in France : "Irène Grosjean : la vie en abundance" that you can watch in english. She healed so many degenerative diseases thank to living food and detoxification, and 5 persons from HIV… Would you agree to honor us by giving us an interview ? You can answer me on the contact tab of my personal page http://sovanna.fr/ or on Instagram RawSovanna (as I wrote you a private message). I was also healed and I raised spiritually thanks to raw living food. Your personal journey is amazing and so inspiring. You have a lot of support everywhere and also from France. Greetings.
Beautiful family ❤!
awesome thanks
You all make me giggle... hugs
You have a Beautiful family Kristina !
Omg love you 3 together👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
🍏🍏🍏🍏
how is your managing to eat rawvegan for weeks..how does she feel
The 3 of you should open up a raw vegan restaurant. You can call it "Kristina Mom and Sis raw vegan restaurant"
Hi, it is difficult to me find young coconuts, so Can I make the yogurth with normal coconuts? Thanks and love from Colombia!!
Definitely will try to make thisyogurt.
🍒🍉🍇🍓🥑🥝🍍🍑
Yummy!! 🌴🌴🌴🍍🍍🍍thanks for this recipe!!!
I can’t get young coconut in my neck of the woods :(  Would this work with regular coconut?
This is the first time I met your sister.  Never knew you had a sister.  Beautiful! I do not know how that woman is related, she is a bit shy around you guys, I think she is self conscious about her smile!  How do I know this!  Because she hesitates to smile.  Maybe all you guys can help her out with that, you guys all have healthly pearly whites and seem to love her so much!💖💖💖 Not to be rude or judgemental but coming from a person who knows by experience💖I am definitely going to try your version as store bought is soooo nooo no matter what quality💖Homemade all the way 💖
have been waiting for this recipe and to see your sister (you are so different, but soo alike) in your videos for a looong time! and now we get to make coconut yoghurt with your sister in one video! Gosh, This is too much for me Kristina! Amazing video
I'm not raw vegan yet #lifegoals but I did start my vegan life 2 months ago and I haven't missed anything....except yogurt on my potato so I can't wait to try this!! Awesome video and family!! Thank you!
I need a mini you in my kitchen...
You’re sister is so cute and funny! Love when you have you’re family members in you’re videos!🍉🍉🍉✨💫
🍇🍈🍉🍊🍋🍌🍍🍓🍒🍑
Thank you ladies! Going to have my sister make me some, yummy!🤗
🍋🥒🥝🍍
From one YouTuber to the next, thanks for sharing!
lmao I love her they look like witches standing over their vita-mix.
I don't have a coconut on hand....can I use organic canned coconut milk??
Good video, but in my personal opinion I don't think a 6 minute video should have a 2 minute intro. In most cases I'll have clicked off by that point as I'm bored of waiting for the content to begin.
The coconut yogurt appears simple and looks delicious but I’m guessing that it is super tart. Is there some sort of sweetener that you could recommend that might offset some of the tartness?
Blessings to your family.
You can do a family business
Hmm wanna to eat this yougurt. do you have a website to sell them online create one today https://goo.gl/2AfeVx
🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒
the way everyone was smiling excessively kinda came across like some cult thing xD are your mom and sister doing a parody of you?
Fun Aztec accent🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
I would like to see the food when it had fermented! :)
A lot of warmth. Thank you.
Can't wait to try this!
🍒🍉🍉🍐🍋
The sister looks like Caputos' girlfriend (Linda Ferguson- from Purchasing) on "Orange Is The New Black" lol
Should give name and qty of the ingredients to u'stand better.
Wow  Bianca looks like your twin!!
Laban is yogurt and Labneh is a strained salted yogurt so, when you make your coconut yogurt (do not add salt before the fermentation process) just add young coconut meat with 2 capsules of vegan probiotics and a bit of coconut water, cover and leave it in a warm place for 24 hours, the next day mix 1 tsp of salt with the yogurt and pour it into a cheesecloth bag and let it drain over a bowl in the fridge for 24 hours, the next day transfer the strained yogurt "Labneh" to an airtight container and use it "it can live in the fridge for 5-7 days"  that's it! And to serve it scoop it on plate and pour some olive oil and zaatar (zaatar is ground dried thyme leaves with toasted sesame seeds and salt) so easy sooooo delicious
LEBAN IS MY FAVORITE FOOD. BLESS YOUR SOUL. I love love love it when you incorporate your Lebanese culture! Proud to be Lebanese!
YT needs to have ❤ button instead of the thumbs up/down
Any one notice how Kristinas sister looks younger, she looks more youthful
Did 👍 to d Beautiful women beautiful family 😄😘🌹💖...👱👵👰👸

Laban is the thiner one, labne is the thick one :) my parents like laban with sugar or maybe with salt and zaatar, and labne is their daily breakfast on a toast with a lot of zaatar. Too bad it comes from cows, cause its really good!
You have a beautiful family.. bless you guys 😍😘🙃🙂😇📿📿🔮🌈🌈🍉🎁🎁🦋🌟🌟🦋🦋
Yesssss arabs represent!!! Ive been craving the creaminess of Laban for a while now and have been looking for a good recipe to get the same tartness! Thank you for this loves❤
