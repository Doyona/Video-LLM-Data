I just ordered some blonde clip on bangs from Amazon and I’m so disappointed with blonde hair it’s much harder to hide the wig and this one I got you can definitely see the wig so I got some clip on hair extensions I’m gonna have to get creative and do what your doing.
Bangs really suit you.
I was so close to giving myself bangs & I am honestly so glad I found this video lol! 😂
So I tried this and turned into a blond Lord Farquaad
Great Video 👏👏👏👏😘😘😘😘🤗🤗🤗🤗🥰🥰🥰🥰
eres muy hermosa como tú y yo soy tu fan Te ves bien me quedé impactada por lo que hiciste descolgando te las dianas te vistes muy genial Saludos me llamo Rubí
💝Wow you are extremely beautiful! You look like a doll😊
but would you seriously go out with that strip of hair on your head? please if you need to do a tutorial, at least try to do it right. if you want to fake bangs, the seam of the extensions should not be seen ...
Really good kick start idea to get started .x
looooove
I have NEVER been so offended in my entire life...
Bangs look so much nicer on her than without them. I think most women look better with bangs and I don't know why so many opt instead for the often haggard look of non-bangs.
It might be cute if you took some of the hair that you cut off & made a little braid & hot glued it to the track :) that or a cute piece of fabric or flowers like a head band :)
I'm not a guy ! You idiot!  :/
*With the shape of an L on her forehead~*       XD I'm not being mean it's just funny
your tutorial is uselesss. you even use a clip on bangs to make one hahahahaha
you look better without it
👎👎👎👎
Since the track shows it's good to wear a headband to cover it or something lol
please dont leave the house with that track showing
I think a quick thin headband would look good and would cover the line :) this is one of the best looking faux bangs I've seen! Thank you
you are using sewing sicsors?
What color extensions did you use in Rapunzel. I'm thinking about using this for a cosplay.
I have never bought hair extensions, so I'm lost.  What type do you recommend?
I kinda think you could pass for Christina agulara in burlesque
Sia haha
great dude loved it
you look like elle fanning
You look adorable with bangs! So pretty :)
lol she doesnt do them she just clips them on and the track is showing
Your so beautiful ❤️
So You Just Going To Leave The Track Showing,?
bye
doe
lol jk
i tought she was calling us losers doe😛😝😜😂😂
i tought she was calling us losers doe😛😝😜😂😂

Can I do it with synthetic extentions? ❤️😭
This makes me want to get bangs again
amaziiing!! u are beautiful💓
she  was wearing a legolas shirt :)
😶😕😐
Her hair is so pretty
no. 😞
great idea!!
without the fake bangs you still cute, i like it
you look like Gwen Stacy from spiderman! 😍
Ingenious! Thank you!
You're so beautiful and your videos are amazing!
when you had pulled your hair into a pony to cut the extensions after sewing I got glimpses of Taylor Swift
very nice and relaxing video :) those looked cool by the end!
So pretty!
u made this vid on my b-day xD
I absolutely love your hair colour!
u should always always always cut extensions by point cutting. keeps it softer and mor natural or u get the doll hair look other than that cool idea
I think this is great for cosplay!Especially if you don't wanna go out and cut your hair to bangs.I was so worried for a minute that I had to cut my hair
You look a bit like Eve Bauregard (not sure if I spelled it properly), the cosplayer
Am I the only one fan girling over her shirt?!
She has the face for bangs
This is really cute but the only problem is that the band shows :(
you look like elle fanning
I think you're my favourite person on the planet, you're so lovely and talented and your videos always make me so happy:') I hope you have a good day:D
You look so pretty 😁 you look like khaleesi
Those bangs look amazing on you
That looks very very good! Thank you so much :3
