Holy crap , did you see how jabbed that fish with a fork to flip it 😅 How did it not fall apart 😅
why would you put it in a oven? terrible chef
After preparing it as you did Ivan, it's beyond me to cook it in the oven at 400F which equals at 204C afterwards on top. You'll certainly finish up with the driest piece of fish ever... My suggestion as a hobby cook: Add some butter , cook 1 more minute on both sides, add just a hint of pressed garlic, baste it a and serve with baby potatoes. Bon appetite.
So you serve the blood line side up???
5 mins.. Nah.. I have to bring to a boil for a little bit longer.  Are you'll catch a stomach virus . It's the worst
Avocado oil is the only oil to fry in. It doesn’t make your food taste like olives, has a higher smoke point than olive oil, and all other oils cause inflammation in your body. Avocado oil is the game changer.
Fish looked so sad
That was simple and easy , thanks!
Thanks for the helpful tips
This stuff came through! Sear + over = clutch. Ended up with random red snapper. Only difference is that i used coconut flour.
That did not look appetizing
look the way u do it so easy just like a piece of cake 👍👏👏👏😊
super simple 👍 thank u very much Chef 👏😊
Probably one of the most unimpressive videos I've seen on pan-searing a fish. My dog ate my kitchen floor and I don't think he would want that grey, unappetizing looking thing.
This red snapper is terrible and I don’t know how this guy is allowed to cook.
Wow just tried it     Thru together and finished it in pan best blackened snapper I have ever eaten and I have eaten a lot of good dishes on coast including blackened Red Fish in its hay day these guide lines were fast and in league of their own .....Good Job Your The Man ....Thank you ...used extra virgin olive oil made sure it was hot before tossing in the filets....all you need is melted real butter to dip it in if you like poor mans lobster.....5 stars....edit being a Texan by birth and living close to the Cajuns I did sprinkle some Slap your Mama’s seasoning on it to give it a little Bam Bam
These are just the tips I needed. Thank you, about to cook it now.
how long to cook on the skillet??
Here from T and COCO to see what this dish was actually supposed to be 😂😂
dead loool salt and pepper shameful
How many minutes on each side in the pan
What if I’m camping? He said “finish in pan”
He didn't say how long it should be  in a 350°-400° oven.  I guess just watch it or watch another video.
I bless you with joy, peace, love and abundance in you life & your Y.T. Channel. Plus all those who follow.
Red snapper has been overfished and is on a list for endangered species. There are better sustainable alternatives to red snapper such as mutton snapper, rainbow snapper or yellowtail snapper. Ask your fishmonger. As a consumer, you can drive the market for sustainable seafood by choosing fish only from healthy, responsibly-managed sources, and caught or farmed in ways which minimize damage to the marine environment.
Recently started doing a light beer batter and frying red snapper in grapeseed oil, it's not lake perch but it's damn tasty.
350  400 F oven . How long  ?
This was wack! This chump doesn’t have a clue
beurre noizette requires butter not olive oil
That's too simple
Yum! Thank you for tips.
What flavor will bland fish taste like?  Who fried a nice snapper filet?

Really, really good!
