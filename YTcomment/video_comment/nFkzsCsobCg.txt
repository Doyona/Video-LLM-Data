My shoes are white boots with mad grass stains and I spent hours with hot water, dish detergent and a toothbrush. I got most of it clean. They are drying and I'm going to hit it again
Why you still put shoes in washer after you already cleaned it with brushes
Can I remove the scuffs on the ZX 5K Boost like you did here? My scuffs are on the bottom of the shoe. Your bottom part of UltraBoost is white, mine is grey and I dont know if the material of that is the same? I dont know if I will just ruin things even more😅
Great tutorial
Soup spuds. 🥔🥔🥔
If there is a scratch on the cage how to remove it
Spuds 🥔 🥔
Basically never get shoes with white soles.
Is the acetone melting a layer of the plastic?
I'm scared that it might make my teeth yellow.
Nail Polish did not remove the scuffs. Any other things that might help?
Toothpaste will clean that boost
nice video! Its great to see see a tutorial that doesn't recommend buying expensive cleaners
You can take a magic eraser to the soles and the white edges and will be perfectly white again. Trust me.
create the potatoes, the potatoes is what gets em clean. 😂
Yo I used the q tip to clean the back part and it left a big ass green stain.
This video is 4 years old and I still come back to it to make sure I'm doing things right! Really appreciate you creating this video man!
Yo bro I know you did this a while ago but do I put the souls in the wash, I have the new Ultra 21
Also what is the pillow case for ? , thanks !!!!
hello , My shoes are red and black  , white sole , and white " cage" , it have black stains on the white stripes ( cage ), will the nail polish work ?
Is it possible to change heel cup colour?
Try using a sanding block on the midsole.  Works well on all my shoes. Better than brushes IMO
Thanks brother <3 take care. Great video
when i got the same washer as him so i feel relieved that theres no way i can mess it up 😎
I can tell you this RESHOEVN8R is a BS product so save your money!
How long did you put them in the washer for?
why don't you recommend bleach? it won't ruin if you don't leave it in too long
Yo I used to use that toothbrush😳😂
i did the same to my og’s :(((
Thank you❤️🙌🏾 used your method and happy with the results.
You take it to the next level but why do you not whitening the midsole with a pen?
Will the nail polish remove the scratches of the cage for the adidas 4.0? I’m not sure the cage is the same material. Thanks a lot if you could get back to ne
Do I have to put insole into the washing machine too?
Really annoying background music.....
Can you put the settings on hand wash instead of delicate
1. Clean the sole 2. Mixed hydrogen peroxide with dishwashing detergent 3. Paint on the mixture with a small paint brush making sure you only get the mixture on the sole. 4 leave it out in the sun as long as possible.The sun activated the peroxide. Repeat this step until sole is white. You’re welcome. Painting these will only make the paint turn dirty fast.
I used acetone on my black and white ultraboosts on the heel cup. It made it so a spot of it has no texture now. Its this good or bad?  Edit: I have the 4.0 show your stripes. They are black with white stripes and a white midsole  https://www.flightclub.com/ultraboost-core-black-cloud-white-carbon-804646
Found some of these on the ground lol
Buy a magic eraser. Thank me later.
Will the acetone work on the cages on my 4.0 triple whites?
Ik im late but what a guy using household products. Walmart soap and and old toothbrush with some detergent works good. No need for a $35 shoe cleaner kit lol
A long bla bla.
My ultra boosts have suede on them tho😐 and I’m not sure what will happen with all the soap cause I don’t want to ruin them
Hey i know this is a 3 year video but do you guys know if the nail polish works on the ub20 cage?
Those soles were white before... how do change them from brown to white?
1:16 watch John manalo he does everything
My OG,s r beat as freak. I have holes and the sole is about to seperate
Thank you so much for this video! 🥰🥰 definitely subscribing!
After the washer how do we dry them do we just leave them outside for a bit ?
How about ultra boost variants with leather?
I ordered a pair of used 4.0s and they are SCUFFED imma clean them up real nice
Yo my chit is orange color.  WTF I try to clean even with some spuds😆 I will try this technique. Anyone else shit turn orange looking.  What work cause that shit seems perma-sealed!
Where do the potatoes come in?  LOL!
Would it work with my all white ISS boost?
Nice job cleaning them. The last step (you should have done) to do is to use one of those oil based sharpie markers to lightly cover up the yellowish on the bottom of the boost.
THANKS!! I HAVE SAME SHOES AS YOURS AND SAME COLOR !!! THANKS A LOT BRO!!!
Does it take off stains
Not even that dirty
Fuck you , just same dirty like shit
For me the shoe was clean in the beginning 😂
a spud is another word for a potato.  soap spuds
Thank you
At 4:33 its AIR word in the shoe !!1 AMAZINGGGGG
F
i dont have any option on mywashing machine lul
Bleach worked great on my white cream yeezys. U can also use a cotton ball instead of  a cutip cuz it’s easier to scrub and hold the shoe upside down so it doesn’t drip down onto the letters. Thanks for the video
What if I don't have a washer at home?
2:12 ask your parents or your wife 😂
THANK YOU!
Is there any type of protectant you recommend after cleaning them up to prevent them getting so dirty?
Did something happen other than disappearing scrathes?
hey you might not see this comment, but can you show me how to clean my Adidas ultra boost 20? im kinda confused on how to clean the padded neoprene part of the shoe. thanks
You could use a white oil based sharpie
My first pair of ultra boost are wayyyyyyy worse, it was genuinely yellow.
If I don't have a washer?
At 4:34 it fr spells air perfectly 😂
Bruh it says air on the heel cup at4:36
4:32 draws 'AIR' on addidas revealing Nike Air
Fool 🙉🙉🙉 if you used only tooth paste  so you get better result
How do you dry them if you can’t put them in the dryer
Toothpaste is very effective on whitening the boost
Do this method useful in removing the colors on the ultra boost's plastic cage? Thx in advance for replying
My white ones look brand new again! Thank you! 😂
I came up with a shorter version I got a cup of water took the insole out soap and a tooth brush and I dipped the tbrush in the bowl and then put soap on it and scrubbed
Can I just rinse it with water instead of putting it in the washing machine?
Do you leave the sole in when you put them in the wash?
best vid of cleaning ultra boost yet.
or just buy a new pair ~
I just want to thank you because I have the white Boosts and it helped a lot. They look amazing!
I’m about to try this with Boosts that is ten times dirtier than yours, wish me luck.
Could a sponge work as a brush
Thankyou Great vid no branded

Gunna try it!   Edit: I tried it and my shoes look brand new! Thanks for all of your help!
How about for ultraboost19 with pink colorway? its primeknit right? can i also brush it?

been searching all over for over a week now for a vid like this... cant get those damn scuffs off my heelcup
2:12 ask your wife first lmaooooo
What if my shoes have suede instead of plastic as the heel cup?
I know this is an old video but what about the soles? You put those in the bag too? Put them back in the shoe? Or wash them separately out of the pillow case? Thanks!
Can you do everything with the toothbrush?
Dang my man spelled air with soap and a finger @4:34
I beat my shoe up worst its all most a black middle sole now XD btw sorry for bad spelling cuz english isnt my main language
Adidas muit million company has a factors releasing poisons down that river. Here are some multi million celebraties that might not know they help poluate that river and contribute to the health of them people. They need to step up and help them with pumps that clean the water.
Water+shot glass of Clorox +scrub brush+ put in sun... fin
Can acetone/nail polish remover be used on the boost area?
If your boost is bad you can get a sharpie PAINT marker and put a few coats to make it new
I use charcoal to brush just my fu***** shoes.
SET the shoes on fire ....coz fire clean everything ...lol
improving the material and colouring the sole better than the white one, scratch resistant is a great feature as well, any how, great tutorial thanks mate
For a beater the boost midsole for ur OG is still pretty clean IMO, yea i get the specks of dirt but damn thats cleaner than any beater i’ve seen so far
👍
loved that vid
It s the same result if I use alcohol instead of acetone?
Used toothbrush + arm n hammer teeth whitening = orig color uboost sole.btway,toothbrush the sole first wd dawn dishwashing liquid.Merci.
Instructions not clear- my Skechers still don’t have boost
hey dude hope you reply to this hahaha but what about the washers that dont have those settings? like yknow, the old type of washer with just the spin timer on it?
Warm or cold water?
Ask your wife first 🤣🤣🤣 that’s me!!
Are you laying down on the ground?
I knows I’m quite late but how to do you clean the plastic part on the boost? Not the cup.
Why do I see the foam forming the word AIR at 4:34 😱
Thanks for the help!
Could you also use nail polish to clean the boost?
nice work my's just bright like never before
What if the washer is broken?
Life saver thanks bro
Anyone else notice the bubbles spelt air
Finally, a cleaning vid that doesn't teach me to spend a bajillion for shoe cleaners or Crep. I was afraid I was doing it wrong, but now I'm more confident with cleaning my UBxGOT and Nike Lunarepic 2.  Thanks for this! And you now have a new sub.
Can i just use a regular tooth brush for everything instead of a hard brush
Just use a cleaner called Totally Awesome to clean the Boost... Cheap - get it at Dollar General I believe...
Can you also put the insoles inside the pillowcase with the laces and shoes?
Thanks for this one. Question though, how do I dry them?
Him: I beat my shoes to hell Me:  *nervously laughs*
Actually worked because some other videos are fake and they chuck dirt on 10 minutes before the video witch is easy to get off
Is it okay if i put them in the wash machine?
Insignificant small detail but to the person who created this video - I wanted to point out that suds actually don’t equal cleaning power, although a lot of people believe they do. The suds are there for psychological purposes because it’s the soap molecules mixed into the water that really do the cleaning.
Does this work with nmd human race?
scam scam !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CAREFUL DONT BUY THIS
What if the nail Polish remover doesn't have acetone in it.
I did the exact same thing about a year ago for a pair of PureBoost 2's.  You don't need to spend large amounts of money on big brand cleaners.  Dish soap does wonders.
Try to cut down on the jumpcuts. I think they are a bit distracting. Otherwise a great vid!
Love your voice! thanks for the tips, very informative. nice songs too!
Good 👍
spuds
Mine has dirt and I tried everything and still does not come off  😭😭
No no no u don’t understand my shoe has coloured chalk on it and it won’t come off. Dm me if u know a good way to remember
What is the name of those ultra boost?
nice
I have cookies and cream 4.0’s and the cage gets so many scuffs I don’t even remember hitting it on anything
The best way?  Don't make it dirty!! 😉
My washing machine doesn't have a delicate cycle can I just throw it in?
Tip, get some of those magic erasers. They work wonders!
I have the same shoes and same washer🤣did everything you did and it came out nice thanks👍
1:20 I don't know why but I really want to drink that bowl of water
Thanks for this!
Budget Crep protect much?
Try buying it here in the Philippines, eazy
Boost soul manufacturing fault with soul colour it cannot white as new
Does it work on white
Worthless video.
How to remove paint of ultraboost???
the black paint on the plastic cage doesnt come off using that remover or is there no paint on the plastic? @jacobisamac
Waiiiit. The UltraBoost Lettering isn't glued on? Damn, i was so scared that i was gonna spend all that money and then have a letter fall off some day.
Can I use the nail polish remover/acetone on the white cage/heel cup?
Ultra boost use?
This works with triple whites too?!?!?
Bro at the end... Mow your grass. There is a bunch of grass cutting/mowing tutorials on YouTube, check them out
Lol the dirt is somehow literally inside the boost on my nmd’s and I haven’t been able to clean it no matter what I do
best tutorial ever thank fuck man thx a lot swear
Idk how well acetone will work on shoes cause acetone is some strong shit. From what I hear it will basically kill your shoes it will pull color off anything
Good looking out bro I got some new ultra boost and got a scuff on the plastic area and I was low-key worried but your nail polish technique worked perfectly thanks man 👍🙏
Do I need to put in wash?
Hey man did you know that crep protect brought out a boost whitener letting you know 😴
mow your lawn
I have a pair of Reigning Champ 1.0 Ultra Boosts. The upper knit is different and much softer, I'm afraid I might mess it up with any brush, even with the toothbrush
So you technically add detergent to the shoe :/
warning, just letting you know acetone can strip paint so be careful with it. that's why he used q-tips.
Dope! Thanks for the tips! That nail polish remover is great
I just use wipes to clean the boost material. I think that a toothbrush is too rough for boost material.
Greetings from Germany and thx
How do u dry it
Soap makes it harder to clean and leaves soapy residue which changes the color of the shoe . Simply use the Car detailing products A car interior spray and car upholstery cleaner the results will amaze you with the minimum hard work and the best bit is that you wont be spending hours on cleaning the shoe and waiting for it to dry
u can also use toothpaste
LOL any tips on if I really beat my boosts and that hand soap + toothbrush trick doesn't clean the boost and it's still discolored?  Or should I just call it :(
Awesome man thanks
Thank you my triple white ate looking fresh
I would not clean ultraboost but maybe some expensive shoes yeah i would
The bottom really work guy the sub botton really work
My shoe is really really boom bam errr srrrr.larrrrr braaaaa
thank u so much

You are wayyyy to delicate with your shoes, i've been washing my ultra boosts and any other shoes in the washing machine for years and norhing has ever happened to them, i wash them at normal setting for 1hr at 30°C. You can actually use the nailpolish remover for your boost too, it will get them white af

Need to clean my ultraboost i got for 20$ from a thrift shop
*paint

Real shit this video is like 1 of a kind
Is it necessary to put them in the washer?
I went to an Adidas store and one of the salespeople there told me to use toothpaste on the boost part (that works for any kind of foam). At first I doubted but decided to try and it works like magic, not no mention it's really cheap.
I was unfortunate enough to step in dog shit with my ultra boost. This helped thanks!
mayun just get sum crep protect
I mean u really cant clean scratches
Bro I was literally about about to buy Reshoevn8r but you just saved me hella money. 🙏🙏🙏

Will acitone remove scuffs on a 4.0 triple black cage
amazing vid !
Appreciate it thanks
Thanks for the video! What do you recommend for the insoles? Can you wash them the same way?
Will this work with nmds
Use oil based sharpie on boost guys, you don’t believe me YouTube it
Great stuff dude!:)
yall... please believe me when I say this! NOTHING WILL EVER RESTORE OR CLEAN BOOST!!! Just accept the yellowing, it gives it vintage character! Boost will never be clean because of one thing and we all know this! What do taking a bite out of an apple, peeling a banana and walking in a boost sneaker all have in common? OXIDATION! Boost is a very complex material. The more complex a substance is, the more organic or life-like. So of course boost will oxidize the more you use it! Look at the yellow and be proud of it... it yellows because its good quality, just like how real leather wrinkles or an organic apple oxidizes quicker than other apples, u get what I mean
Wow! can’t believe it actually worked
Can I use fabric softener also when washing it?
there are scratches on my ultra boost what do I do to get rid of those
now to recover the lettering?
Take a white oil based sharpie and color the boost that usually makes it pretty white but tape off the parts your don’t want to be white
the world needs gay men for this info.. thanks

Anyone notice to said “AIR” on the heel cup at 4:34 haha
My ultraboosts are very new and I scratched the boost sole. Now there is a sort of shallow tear on the boost material. Any thoughts on what to do about it? Dirt is getting in it and making it look worse, and I'm worried that it will get worse and fuck up the sole. Should I try to fill it in somehow? Advice much appreciated, thanks.
Does anyone know the best method of gettring rid of dog poop smell from around the torsion system on the ultra boost?

GREAT VIDEO

Dope vid fam

SPUDS I'm dead some potato
I got gold Metal ultra boost and I thought they were dirty but the boost is all chipped and peeled and it's like grey
Don't know if this was already commented, but for the white boost part on the bottom that is fading yellow, you can use an oil based white sharpie marker to go over it. It works wonders
Will the nail polish remover work with any color of shoe?
Question what if the washer does not have the settings like yours and what if u put purex will it clean? ASAP

Dang this dude is awesome he replies to all of your questions👍👍👍
I used the crep clean kit on my 3.0s but I used the brush they gave with it will that damage the primeknit?
Do you think the acetone will work on the NMD XR1's cage? Haven't had these a whole month and the cage is scratched up
Aren't every ultraboost cage also like 3.0 plastic too? Because I have scratches on my cage
In the end the sole is still dirty. Lol.

Throw the shoes in the washer when you notice that they are slightly dirty. The more you wash, the easier it is to clean.
How long should you do it

Stop touching the Boost all weird.
Does rubbing alcohol also work

This technique work incredibly. It is so easy too. I have had my ultra boost for 2 months and used them everyday at school and for long jump.
