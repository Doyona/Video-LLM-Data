My car is new and I already have to do this goddamnit I suck at driving
Was the part you repaired plastic or metal? Does this work on metal?
a lot of these comments are so helpless 😭 “can I use this to fix a scratch on my car?”
How come you weren't worried about having to paint the whole bumper to "blend the colors"? That's the emphasis that many body shops have been telling me in their quotes on why they have to do the whole bumper
Two doors on my car have some large long scratches. Can this method fix them? Thanks.
Is the base coat spray the same as like the little bottle of paint that has the same paint code as the door provides
Great work, outcome, and awesome video. My only suggestion would be to use a sponge-like sanding block with the sandpaper instead of applying uneven pressure on the sandpaper with your fingers.
What to do when bumper also get scratches
Awsome video. I feel I can do this! also made me loh, laugh only in my head, not outloud. Still, ty
Oh my goodness. Someone hit my pretty red 2017 Jeep Compass on the right front, like a truck pulled forward in a parking lot rather than reverse. Scratches and two 2.5 inch gouges in the paint. I'm guessing more than $800 now. My brother worked in a body shop in his 20's. Runs a private airport now and does touch-ups on planes. I'm hoping when he comes in town he can fix it for me. I'm a DIY person but think this is over my head. Great job! In 2025 this is probably a $2500 repair.
Awesome job ❤❤
Great video.
How do you make sure the color grade of the repaired are is the same as the rest of the body?
Thank you for this video. You are very peaceful, humorous, and your desire to help the world is honorable.
Amazing job 👌🏻nicely done
Cost me a bit more and I didn't get the same results.  Someone in here said "less is more" with the body filler.  I took that advice and still got slammed with that lesson.  My advice: if you have a large area to do with the body filler - MAKE MULTIPLE SMALL BATCHES.  It dries fast, and if it's drying as you're applying you may end up with large clumps that take FOREVER to sand down.  I'm not even sure if I did it right since the area I sanded is bleeding through now that I'm on the "let it dry overnight" step.
Good video-- very clear instructions. Thank you.
will try
Drink every time he says “clean microfiber towel”
So this is basically a how-to repair plastic, I take it. Judging from the thumbnail. And NOT a "how to repair scratches on your car," as the title suggests.
👏 great job
You can see the where the primer shrunk at the end of the video. Better to use actual automotive tape rather than household tape. Keep practicing
Great video. High quality good info and funny!
I have the same Jeep with those exact same scratches 😂🤦🏽 I’m watching this cuz my neighbor’s motorcycle fell on the rear door and although it’s small, it kinda looks worse than the front bumper
I wonder if this technique will work for dents as well.
I would like to know that "Bondo filler" you applied was for plastic?  If just the regular Bondo filler for metal, any problems after 7 years? I was told by 3M that they don't produce filler for plastic anymore. So wondering what filler I can use for bumper now.
So I scratched my sister's car today. Tomorrow is her wedding. Still haven't told her
My Truck was hit and it cost $13,000 in damages. Truck was parked and I was not in it. Whoever hit it, put one of those rubber "Jeep" ducks in the hole in the grill. Got it fixed. Too 20 days. The second I got it back, I hit a metal hand rail at Caliber Collision. FML!!
Excellent! Thanks
Wow that was an amazing job.   And mad funny,  keep up the great work man.      Lol "nooooooooooo"
nice one .
Thanks. This is what I actually need done.
Lookin at this in 2025 and I know the cost of all the materials has gone up enormously.
This was exactly what I was looking for!
Total time took?
I was rather depressed when I made some rather big scratches on my toyota camry. Then I read your article and I was cheered up!! Not only did  you empower me to do it myself with your thorough step by step instructions, but you made me laugh too!!! Thanks so much Thomas!!!
0) Look in the Driver's side door to see what kind of paint is needed. 1) Collect your paints. These should be: Sandpaper 80-2500 Painter's Tape Sand-able Primer Basecoat Colour Gloss Clear Coat Plastic Spreaders Body Filler (And Water)  2) Sand the scuffed area with 180 grit sandpaper. 3) Clean with clean microfiber towl  4) Mix the Body filler with hardener to the correct ratio.  5) Apply the body to the scratched areas with the plastic spreader, and let dry for 10 minutes 6) Sand areas with 80grit, then 180grit to smooth that. 7) Microfibre towel  8) Cover areas you don't want affect by paint with painter's tape. 9) Apply first coat sandable primer from the recommended distance. 10) wait 5 minutes, and apply second on a slightly wider area. 11) Wait another 5 minutes, and apply third coat on a wider area. 12) Let it dry for 30 minutes. Then wet 800grit sandpaper and sand down the primer. 13)  Sand with 1500grit sandpaper, then microfibre towel it to clear it. 13)  Sand with 2500grit sandpaper, then microfibre towel it to clear it.   14) Spray area with a light base coat colour, and let it dry for however long is needed. 15) Spray a slightly wider area with a second coat, and let it dry . 14) Spray a further wider area with a final coat, and let it dry .  15) After 30 minutes, apply a gloss clearcoat. Like before, to 3 coats over a wider area.
I enjoyed the video and am going to try it out... however, most of the links for your Amazon's products are not available.  I had to search the name of the product to find another listing that worked.  So, you might want to put fresh links because I would hate to see you not get compensated for the sales.
Great video Thomas.  You got to the issue right away without a commentary about nothing.  Great job and I use your techniques.  Really helpful - thank you!
How much would scratch like this cost to repair?
What type of water to use
Just curious at 3:15 you start applying primer but over a large section which includes prior clear coated areas.  Did you scuff that prior, and any problems applying sandable primer over original paint/clear coat?
Does the cost of materials include the glass of water? ;-P
Thanks!!! - hope to be able to do exactly this on my "23 KIA
to anyone who is trying this, please please have a lot of patience and dont spray the color all at once, if you do, it drips horribly but this really does work, worth a try (again with patience)
My car has got similar scratches on the front bumper, if I leave it like that, is it going to rust?
I scratched my husbands new car 😳😢 I hope this works
Thank you somuch....will try fix my car by myself....., after I will come back here to show. But I am just too lazy now 😢
I dabbed 😂
Buff indeed
Great video. Love the humor added in
To the person who scratched my car and didn’t said shiii! FY
Nicely done!
Got a huge scrape while trying to get through a parking garage entrance. Thanks for the video.
Grear video. Whats your location please?😊.
The before and after looks like sorcery but I'll give it a shot anyway
I know this is just the plastic bumper but with it be applicable on the door? Or metal part of the car?
Just scratched the corner of my bumper on a concrete post. Thanks for the video man 🤣
Looks great but it seems like a lot of work.
I got a long one covering both doors and the trunk it will take me days to fix😢
Can you share the link of primer that you used
Thanks for the great video. I followed the instructions but when I sprayed the lacker it made sume bump into the surface. Any tips on what to do to avoid this? Should I try send it down?
Il try it on a scrap from car yard wreckers
Awesome useful video, many thanks Thomas!.. and huge credit to you that it has 8 Million views! (June 25) And nearly 8000 comments - many of which have been responded to 🤣🤣 Awesome Youtuber 👍👍👍👍
Great vid. Dad jokes are ok aswell
Can't you just buy a spray paint to spray?
Amazing Job…!!!!!love the vid….
Was that plastic or metal where the scratches were? I have similar scratches  (not quite so bad - but still noticeable) they’re above my right rear bumper indicator light, but the panel is plastic - does it matter??
This video is actually amazing step by step and me and my bf will be trying this as i just got a big scratch today!
Can I send you a pic of my car I scratched today and tell me if this will work for my car ?
Who is here in 2025 after scratch they 🚗 like me😂
Awesome job
Miracle man😮
You pay 800 so that you dont want to fk the procedure are make it even worse. Convenience = money
Great job man! The exact video I needed
Where can I buy all this
thank you so much for this video! I scraped up my car that my dad gave me for college in a stupid misjudgement of space in a parking garage 😭 Im hoping this saves me some money lol
How much would something like this cost at auto body shop!
Well done…. I have key marks and other scratches on two of our cars… need help here Lexus pearl white color.. need some help here thanks.. ❤
Thanks for your wonderful video> Please help me to write down this: from 1:58 to 2: 04: what do you use? and sandpaper ?? the red bottle ?? and smal tube from 2:08 to 2:15. Thanks
Im about to get RIPPED
just scratched my new bmw bumper.. but everything will be here in 2 weeks 🎉
I've seen people make videos like this as long as 20 minutes. You did it in less than 7 minutes and made it entertaining. Thank you!
I'm scared to use primer lol. I wish my scratches aren't that deep. But heck of a video man. ❤ Btw you Pinoy?
Nice body work.  Great narration and camera work.  Thank you.
My wife's driving capabilities brought me here.😢
When you spray the paint on your car, does it need to go in a certain direction?
Great video.
Is someone able to do a video call I’m on the primer step and unable to figure what I’m doing wrong lol
I plan on doing this soon, I’ll keep the chat updated. Thank you for the great video!
Duuuude you crack me up!!! 😂 And thank you for the informed video
I KNEW IT WASN’T FOR DRINKING!!, I’m a detailer, my gf got scraped in a parking lot.
Who's watching this after they bought an already scratched car lol
Awesome and hilarious 😆  When you say 5 passes with the polish do you add polish each time or you just go back over the area 5 times?
1:00 learned something new
I’m watching this after I scrapped the side of my Suzuki 😏
I found a leaf 🍀 blocking the drain hole on top of the sunroof...  Pulling it out solved my problem
Good stuff! Thanks for helping me fixing the scratches my car already had, and the ones i made 😂😂
how much does that cost?
Thanks for making us laugh while we learn to fix our fuck-ups😂 your awesome!
Ok
Does anyone have a UK List for these items?
This is why I paid $400 to my local detailer to fix one ding on my CRV.  Sometimes time is more valuable then a few dollars.
Can you do mine plz 🙏 lol
I'm sorry but they charge 800 usd for a single car part to be painted over there? LOL my fking country charges 100-150 euro per part according to the job, this method will barely save me money😭
You are officially my hero. I have a 3 month old car that has scrapes on 3 panels ... don't ask. This morning the smash repairers quoted AUD$2500 WTF
ME. RECENTLY I CRYIED FOR 3 DAYS FOR INCIDENT HAPPEND I DIDNT SLEEP FOR 3 DAYS TO
Honestly just from reading this, I think I'm gonna embrace the "scratches give it character" and "each mark is a story" philosophy
I need to try this on my two week holiday break coming up
Hood job
Thomas how do you blend the lightly sprayed edge of the new clear coat to the old clear coat?  Will compound make the sandy dry coat smooth like the old one?  Thanks.
got hit by an animal and got all scratched up somehow on top of fender and bumper fucked
Ummm Ill just pay $800
wow
Watching this video 1/2/25 to save my life 🥴
For those wanting a cheat-sheet breakdown of each step, here you go:  1/ 180 grit sandpaper to sand the scratches 2/ Clean with a microfibre towel to clean up the dust (dry) 3/ Mix body filler to hardener to right ratio 4/ Apply only to the deep scratches with a plastic scraper 5/ Let dry & then sand with 80 grit over the body filler 6/ Then a 180 grit to make it smoother 7/ Next, clean up the area with a microfibre towel to prepare for painting (dry) 8/ Mask areas to prevent overspray 9/ Spray the sand-able primer 5 minutes between coats, total 3 coats with each covering more and more area 10/ Let dry for 30 minutes 11/ Clean with a dry microfiber cloth again 12/ Sand with a 1500 grit wet sandpaper 13/ Then sand with a 2500 grit wet sandpaper 14/ Dry with a microfiber cloth 15/ Spray with the base colour like the primer, 5 minutes between coats & covering more & more area 16/ After 30 minutes apply gloss clear coats like the primer & base coats 17/ Leave dry overnight 18/ Next day clean with water & a microfibre towel 19/ Leave dry for 5 minutes 20/ Apply compound in dabs & rub in making 5 overlapping passes (by hand) 21/ Again, clean with a fresh clean microfibre towel 22/ Allow to dry for 5 minutes before applying a polish 23/ Polish with firm pressure & overlapping passes using a polishing pad (by hand) 24/ Then wipe it off with another clean microfibre towel This is your final 'buff' 25/ Done!
First car  first day  first scratch
Hands down the best video on paint repari!
Ah, a new task at hand that I must do for my car. Very good video. 👍
How do you get the correct paint ? Like do they actually sell aursal paint like the ones for the walls ?
Very useful video!! Thank you!!  Would you also do one for repairing leather or vinyl tears of a car's interior?
I love this dude energy 😂❤❤
Did you apply the clear coat on top of the color paint? and, compound should be applied on top of the clear coat, right?
Wow OMG looks so easy 😮
thanks for the tips. very informative and straight to the point
brother nice video i burn a a paint because of sand paper how fix thank you brother
Any advice on finding the right color for your car?
Thank you for explaining so clearly and slowly.
Good work
Omg….you just saved my pockets…..will let you know how I do with MY CAR👍🏽
I got scratches on my car trying to squeeze it out of a tight parking spot my husband put it in. It scraped against the stucco of our house all along the side. I tried not to make it scrape but there was no way around it.  It was either scrape it or leave it stuck. The scratches were big and plentiful. I used a Mr. Clean eraser (available at any supermarket or drug store in the cleaning aisle). I got the idea from having to clean black permanent marker off a white painted wall successfully. I wet it and gently rubbed the paint (I did this on a small spot first since I didn’t know if it would also remove the car’s paint job as well. It cleaned the paint from the scratch without messing up the rest of the original paint job! I had to put a little more elbow grease into some areas but it worked. You actually couldn’t even tell that it was ever scratched!
After wasting $150 it’s going to professionals to fix it. The result was not the same although I followed all the steps.  I had a scratch on plastic bumper and may be it has few extra steps to take.  Lucky those who could save some money .
Thank you.  If I wet sand primer then it washes away the primer from plastic and you can see the imperfections. It’s not smooth.  I used it again at the imperfections then it started dripping. I will try dry sanding
What’s the meaning of five passes - does that means five times
Yes u did a good job 😊
I’m watching this after they told me how much it cost 😂😂
Lmaoo, "arms are now buff" 😆 great video tho, (awesome instructions) 👏
I tried this myself and would recommend against it.   The materials cost heaps already and you will likely not use them up at all.  Then you gotta put hours of work in for a mediocre result.   In this video he is holding the spray can like 10 cm from the car, which would not work with most spray cans. 20-30 cm recommended.  Also, the paint tends to drip very easily, leading to an endless priming or painting and subsequent sanding process that can easily go through like half a dozen rounds.   The end result did not look as smooth as in the video at all and looking back, I would have rather not done it myself tbh.
Great video! Thank you for the suggestions!
I just scratched my father's car nd dented it..I need this to work honestly, he's still sleeping
Total cost, $120 in material, $680 in labour
If you paint in temperatures too low, the paint will not look good when dry.  Caution, I did this and it turned out awful.
Scratching a car sucks😭😭, just scratched mine today😂
How did it merge this good ? I have a jet black car and last time I did a dIY the painted area looked like patched piece😢
I guess after watching to many how to remove scratch DIY video repaint is the most absolute and direct solution to learn and master.
Thanks for this. Will normal white masking tape be ok instead of the blue tape?
This was so helpful, funny, and weird.  Thomas thank you for taking some anxiety out of a frustrating situation. 😊🎖🎖🎖🎖🎖
Funny!
Thank u sooo much
Bro you saved my life
Anyone got some tips for me i bought a car and turns out the front bumper has been replaced in the past it was a gray bumper they painted in black (black is the colour of my car) and i had like a glue’d piece of plastic to my bumped i took it off recently and with taking it off it also took a huge chunk of my paint so im looking to fix it but i dont know what grid sandpaper i should use for this fix should i start with a lower number ald build my way up to 2500 or should i just clean the area and start with high grids like 1500 and work my way up to 2500 ?
Great video! I'm headed to Autozone to buy the stuff!
Dude thank you SO much for making this, and for the thorough rundown of supplies
Amazingly helpful, funny, motivating, inspirational, and educational video. May you be blessed for sharing and giving me the courage and knowledge of how to properly do it. The process of painting and fixing damaged areas on my vehicles is now simple to do. “I am your Daddy” Darth Vader 😂😂😂💪🏾 Amazing Video! 😂⭐🙌
Somebody backed up and scratch my BMW X3  notice when i was putting air in my tires 😢
Need to work on your sound…
^don't you see it if you paint only a part ? Why dont you show the whole front of the car so one can see wether there is a difference in color..
Excellent video.
Wow great job will you do mine. I don't think I could do that myself lol
This video rocks!  Thanks for sharing this and will be trying it.
I'm going to try this ..thank you so much 👍
What kind of water do I need to drink ?
Why do you make it look so easy??
Excellent work
Too much work, I guess I will pay the $800. 😢
So that's why its called buffing
I followed these steps, got the right color and the spot I painted is showing up a little Matte and lighter than the rest the car
i am your daddyy
Dabbed some compound 😂 this guys actually  quite funny
What was the second spray can you used? You didn't mention it in video. The first spray can was the sandable primer. Your 3rd one was glossy.
I’m just here to warn anyone with a black car who might see my comment… DON’T DO IT!!! You can make it look decent enough to pass on your fenders… but any flat surface? YOU’RE NOT THAT GUY. (Or girl) I’m certainly not. I got ambitious while doing my bumper. Thought I would fix up the door dings on the passenger side and the spots on the hood where the bug guts had eaten through the paint. I hate myself for it every day. It doesn’t matter how much you sand or polish, it will not be unnoticeable. Save yourself the regret!
How the hack the YT algorythm knew that my car has the same scratch same color I never looked for that at no site or web search engine this is very weird😮
😂💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🔥🔥🔥
I'm not handy, this is  complicated and outside my budget...for now. I appreciate the video though.
how durable is the paint job? also what type of body filler did you use? because of the plastic bumper?
Great video thanks but I’m trying to find a body filler in my area the link is out of stock is there any other product you would recommend?? I also am looking at a compound would you say to get polishing or rubbing compound? Did you use the wax , when and how?
Great work!!!
hi
Nice job !
My car has various scratches on body, so I’ll give this a go, with some help from my Dad.
Thomas, i have some light scratches on the side door of my black 2016 Jeep Cherokee 75th Anniversary Edition,  which was in beautiful condition until the scratches.  I am going to follow your tutorial and bring my baby back to her beautiful self! Thank you.
I have a scratch just over the rear wheel cover. The scratch goes over both plastic and metal. Do I need two different compounds for this?
Can I do this outside?
Can i follow my car paintjob following this video
Great video and the humor was awesome as well 😂
Really easy to follow.
Watching incase if any scratches
Good job!
What are the brand and type of materials?
Man this is not for the weak, I tried it and my bondo come off after sanding the sand primer like the tutorial stated, so I then painted over the black scrap and my car is red, and the paint woudnt even cover the black scrap for some reason. I literally spent 4 hours for nothing 😭😭
how long does this process take?
what about overspray on the other panels of the vehicle
How do I get my car’s color in spray? Everywhere I look, it’s quarts or gallons. Do I need a professional sprayer? It doesn’t look like he’s using one
When do you  remove the tape - just after applying the clear coat or do you wait until after it drys overnight? Thanks
Thank you, Thomas! Give this man a, "high-five!"
I will be harnessing this to try and repair some scratches I have on a Lexus RX450h . Have sent a direct email to you I obtained from your instagram account.
Bro by any chance do you know if bubbles appear what does it mean? Do I have to do that bubbled area again?
Great video I’m gonna try it
Something very important when using body filler is that it is designed for plastic. Regular body filler does not adhere to plastic. If I'm not mistaken, that body filler is not for plastic, which will cause the job to not last.
Thank you very much for sharing.
Why is everything blurred out?
how amazing 99% of humans, don't whipe their shit 💩 properly after defecation. But cares much, obsessed with slight scratch on bumpers 😂😂😂
Never saw him use the clearcoat huh.
I cannot think Thomas enough. This works beautifully. I'm a 74-year-old woman who bought my first new used car in 15 years. My sporty 2022 Honda is lower to the ground than my previous car so I have unfortunately scratched low frontal parts of it a couple of times. Following Thomases instructions no one could tell that anything had been damaged. I am so grateful.
Is the total price of all that stuff plus all the labor really worth it?  Instead of going to a pro? Great video though.
Not all heroes wear capes thank you my man I really appreciate it
wow this is a lot of work. i thoguht it be a lot easier
Guilty. My stomach squirm every time I see it😅😅😅. The level of anxiety I get from that scratch is beyond comprehension. Uff...
I need to do this so badly, its just, i dont have a garage or something sealed or enclosed that i can paint in. Cause painting outside is literally a nightmare and it always turns out bad
that was realy fantastic. thank you😉
Bro this video will save me about 800. Down to the local hardware store I go. 💪🏾
Thomas sounds easy guess ill try it
Where can I find the sandable primer?
Thank you. Very helpful and you're very funny.
Preciate it, T!
I did mine and it looks perfect but when i touch it its rough not smooth like before what did i do wrong?
Fact: you came here on purpose
*”Thanks, Thomas!” 💪🏾 -  MELL DUNEY 616*
Brilliant 👏
Video was so good I scratched my car on purpose to get buffed.
How much would it cost to have a repairman do this?
I tried and everything went well except I had a build up of paint at edge of where I taped.  How do you avoid?
Awesome finish great job.
I just smacked a cone while drifting and I don’t feel like paying 400$
wow man looks so easy!
damn bro that looks great! if you don’t do body work for a living you might wanna consider it!  how much would you charge for the damage i have on my vehicle compliments of a wallgreens pharmacy drive thru😳🤬lol ✌🏼
"Wow, this video is a lifesaver! Thomas not only showed us how to save a ton of money by repairing car scratches ourselves but also made it look so easy. The step-by-step instructions and materials list were incredibly helpful. Thanks, Thomas, for empowering us to take car maintenance into our own hands!"
This guy is not your average joe
Nice
I did this and its great but i have spots that are shiny and spots that are matte (dull). I have a black car. Idk what to do. I used the compoud amd polish and its still off. I even got the buffer machine its stoll has spots
Well done! I would repair scratches, and dents, on my vintage Dodge van in a very similar way. What I thought is that if I can't do a good enough job I can always bring it to a shop and pay the pros to fix it. I never had to bring it to a shop tho :D  The more you have to do this work - the better you get at it and the more your confidence builds up! After the 3rd paint repair I removed a door panel, banged out a dent (acquired in a parking lot from a negligent driver), and fixed the paint. Saved a ton of cash.
You didn’t come across to this video  You find it on purpose after scratche
800/1500/2500 on primer ? Horrible
Someone scratched my car, and they left bruh
Hi Thomas. I followed your steps but but I messed up to use black primer for gray color. When its dry up, it showed black spot every where. Now I want to remove everything and do it again. What the best way to do that? Should I sand them out? Thanks
Thinking how and how well can you actually fade the line of new and original paint/clearcoat?
Where I can buy all the material?
Bro this is too much how the am I supposed to do this when my dad comes home in 8 hours 😅
If I do this, should I still make a claim to my insurance? I don’t want my rates to go up since I already suspect I’m paying too much and can barely afford what I have now.
How do you know which Primer to buy?
How many coats of paint you did? 6 as well?
For how long i have to sand the scratches first and Body filler later ? Any tips for that?
How do you avoid over spray on the area without scratches?
Sad someone ruined this fine video overdubbing the informative speech, with annoying muzak, just like a cheap commercial…..please leave it out…😎
Grandma gave me her car and it’s been through hell. Learning so I can make it look good 🙏🙏
When did u use clear coat ??
Great job
All that paint is going to peel and not last very long at all.  Ur primer and paint have to grab a smooth surface because u did not scuff the area to give new chemicals the ability to bight into.  It's gonna peel for sure.u did not blend old clear with new clear.  The area where both clear met will have up and show for sure. This is how u do a ok  job that will look half assed in person.  You almost did a good job.  Find a road car painter who can do the job right for about 200.
IGH I WAS SUPPOSE TO SAMD IT!? ONCE THE PRIMER SETS ? I MESSED UP ALREADY 😭
Did you use scale for mixing filling for the right quantity or you just mixed with idea ?
For sandable primer which color should i purchase, I want to repair Tesla Y red color
I’m watching after my woman scratched my ride
this is the cleanest job i’ve seen, i hope i can replicate it 😂
Hey mate, followed your video and it worked a treat on my wifes car...i wish i could post a pic😂
Brilliant
Great job! Thanks for sharing.
I have never seen 7 millions views and I am included… Congratulations 🍾
I will be doing this to my civic in 2 weeks
Anyone else bothered by the sloppy mouth talking? Move away from the asmr mic
I’m pretty sure I would spend $120 to create $3000 in damage.   I’m impressed that you did this so well
Someone hit my car in a parking lot and drove off 🥲
😩thank you I ove you
How long was this process
Can you get these paints at the dealers or do you need to order them online?
800$ for this tiny area , so what will they charge for the whole car
With my naked eye, I agree, you did an excellent repair....
Where can i get my car's paint do i have to go to a body shop
Who's watching this after you sideswiped a guardrail 😂😂
Looks good with gray. But will it work with red?
After buffing my arms are now buff.😂
How do you know u sanded enough
I am going to do this
Will try that 😂 let you know how it goes got on
How do you blend with the existing paint work? You didnt really show this because the camera was pretty close
How hard is this to mess up? I’ve never worked on my car but I’m thinking of doing this as there are a couple scratches on it.
5:03 😂😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥
the result is awesome yes, but what if you have ding dong dent in the car door?
How about  when someone tries to get out of a parking vehicle next to you or getting  in the park área  and damage your  side passenger side door.
Amazing
Spun out nasty
I did same process but the pint no look same is match little bit more light and you see not look ok I look something what can help me match same color I do lot for this I almost give up 😂
Great video, very to the point and simple. Unfortunately my car is quite old and I can't afford a new one so I will be doing this to many old scratches on my rear bumper and a couple on the front. I feel much more confident having watched this. Thanks 👏
I dabbed some compound 😂
I just scratched my dads pick up truck, good thing I found this video before i got beat up
Man that came out great, good job
good job.
Would this work for multiple rock chips in an area?
Body shop quoted me $4200 for a scratch like that....I nearly shat my pants
amazing, great job
You're hilarious😂 thank you for making my terrible tragedy not as bad.
I have a Fiat Linea Tjet of the same colour (I think.) looking forward to fixing the city miles on it in a few days!
It looks great but doesn’t seem to have much shine as the surrounding areas , unless it’s the lighting .
Question: Is this method also applicable to a whole frontdoor ? I’ve got a real circular scratch with “autograph”😢 made with a key or screwdriver from a rascal. And how much paint to buy than ?
I got light headed while driving and i ended up scratching my brand new car 😢 tge scratch is quite deep
I took a fall on my motorcycle and its not bad scratch but I am totally wanting to fix it myself
Thank you for allowing me to drive less considerately knowing I can fix it myself now❤
You did a professional looking job ! 👏🏽
Pov: Driving Dad's car and smashing it
Thank You! I after taking forever to find a Detailer Guy who said he'd fix me up the very next day (today), but, then pulled a classic No-Show, So, after finding and watching this vid, I'm now a man with a plan as I'm headed to the Automotive Paint Supply Store. I'll let you know how it all turns out...
How long after you applied your final coat did you wait to buff it??
Nice work man!  I just may give it a try.
Somebody hit an run my car an my front bumper is all stretched up no dents so hopefully by this video I can fix all the stretches
I have scratches, chips, dents, and random spots of faded paint (1cm wide) on my 2018 Nissan Sentra but it’s not from me, it’s from the previous owner. And I’m like OCD I like a perfect car so I wanna fix it
I am sadly. 😢😢
Today I got done at work and got to my car and noticed someone side swiped my fucking car. No cameras around so pretty much stuck with it. Not even worth reporting. No cams means no proof. So yeah I'm here lol.
Are the spray paint cans that you buy the same quality paint as the factory paint the car manufacturers use?
Nice job
Great Video and short. Looks great. Thank you.
My wife who is now my ex-wife 😠😡
ENJOYED THE VID AND YOUR HUMOUR
Any idea why the clear coat that I used once on the hood after the paint peeled in flakes after about 6 months? Thanks
Really great.excellent.more than professional. Smart  learning
Hello, when you say 5 passes do you mean just going over and over again with the compound and the polish, or do you add the compound again?
Well done, you saved $680
For the amount of work one would put in, I think $800 quoted from your bodyshop is a fair price.
Excellent video, nicely explained, and I loved the humour!! Liked and subscribed!! 😃👍👍
Chainsawed my whole side on a barbed wire fence acting like a diy expert now lol😂
Guess I will have to pay. Too advanced for me.😢
Walden brother
Can you use same primer for white cars ?
very nice job
I'm never letting my sister drive my car again
Can you put what brand of products you used?
My car got scartch today. And My Heart like 😞😞😞
3:09 wtf lmao
"Clean Micro-fibre towel"
Lookin good
That was very impressive and funny.  Kudos!
Thanks a lot, was really helpful.
Great video , I’ll be attempting to do this over the weekend on my old ugly 1995 Nissan maxima
Is it possible can I just use the paint only and paint at the spot where it was scratch?
Anybody whose car has no scratches whatsoever?
I’m trying it today
Great video! Did you apply the compound 5 separate times? Or just did five passes over the same area with one application?
Im thankful for coming across this video after scratching my dads bumper
STRAIGHT LEGITE WORK💃AFTER WATCHING YOUR VIDEO. IM GOING OUT TO GET SOME SCRATCHES!!!! 😂😂seems more enjoyable than detailing and I'm sure the paint,"smells like laughter🤣"
YOU'RE HALARIOIS!!!!! Lol thank u. Superior Detailing NW, Rocky
Honestly amazing!!! Really great teacher you are
Can you do this on new cars?
Thank you so much for this.  Got rear-ended today.  The damage was a lot less after I cleaned up the area and this video, along with all the comments gives me confidence.  Thank you, again.
would this work on the front of a car. Or only the bumper?
I just found this video. Really good and detailed. I loved the humor. Great job.
Yeah Good job buddy
Nice job.
Isn't it covered under insurance? 😮
Great video, good job. Is no way that you only drank one glass of water.
Why the new paint and the old paint do not have a colour difference?
I bought all the products.   I followed all the steps.   The end results were horrible.    I should have left the scratches instead of trusting this video.
SALUTE CHAMP THANKS
This looks like a full day job for the average person.  For some it doesn't make sense to lose a full day's wages because of this! It's cheaper to take it to the body shop.
My friend please right  Down name is
7 mill views?? haha, this is the go to for car scratch repair!
someone hit my car and left so i’m here now
Came for the info, but stayed for the Oscar-worthy acting 🙂
Awesome video! What primer and gloss clear coat did you use?
Wifey scratched the Benz.. here I am
Excellent job
Do you know any Canadian brands that are equivalent to the automotive touch up brand you’re using? I went to order but it doesn’t look like they ship to Canada.
Pretty Darn Good! I know if I did it it would look horrible. 😂
is this suitable foe metalic finishes ?
Awesome results, very dedicated
Wow!!! What a difference
yo does it actually blend in w the original paint colour? or can you kinda see it if you look closely??????????? haha thks
how did you find the right color for your car?
I went out and scratched my car on purpose just to do this. Let’s goooooo!!!
No clear coat?
How long did I have to wait before using compound? I used it and some of the paint came off now I have to start over! :(
I accidentally scratched my family mine van when learning to reverse park 😔 got to fix it now thanks for the help
Watching Right here !!!! Lol
How do I find the exact tone of the color of my car?
Why do Americans always need to tell you the year of their car, lmao
Where can I buy the items you used?
Hey Thomas. Would you really do this instead of going to a car shop? Is this the best and cheap easy way?
It's ok to spray primer over existing clear coat? I noticed that on your video. some of area you primered wasn't completely sanded.
Nice job and thank you for the video.
Can I use bondo brand instead of others? Does bondo drying time longer than your body filler?
Today, your excellent video served as a great stress relief after the front corner of my beautiful blue Honda Fit got scraped by the carport wall while navigating out of my very narrow parking space. The car only recently spent three months at the body shop after it was damaged in a collision caused by a reckless driver. To my delight, the Honda body shop restored it to like-new condition🌟 So, today's incident had me pretty bummed out, despite the damage being less than yours😞 I am now motivated to tackle this challenge. I will also cover part of that wall and parts of the two opposite posts with self-adhesive carpet tiles. Halfed pool noodles on the wall already successfully prevent damage to the door as I squeeze myself in and out of the car each day. So, thank you again for the great video and the additional useful tips by commenters🙏🏼😊
Awesome job, and cheap compared to what  it would cost to paint a car .
Can the sanding be done with a sander or it has to be done by hand?
I’m at a dentist appointment with my mom I took her here but scratched the car when parking 😕
Good job!
What did you use on your cloth to clean after wet sanding the primer?
For that money you could fix other bits of the body. Good work !
Do i have to use body filler ?
Excellent tutorial video
Good job...thx for the step by step detail and supplies needed.
That's very amazing I'll think about doing that in front of mine cuz there's a deep scratch there I was just going to wait on it thank you for sharing
If you have a unique color (something not common) on your car, how do you know which color paint to get to exactly match it?
You did a very good job.
Entertaining but really helpful and educational
Jist scratched my car😕😐Now im here lets hope this works lol
PARABÉNS E MARAVILHOSO.
The dance pose is like a subliminal message. I can't quit watching .
Thumbs up!   I've done stuff like this in the past.. I don't have time these days - but you save a ton of money..   Great Job
Instead of the sand paper   Can we use buffer machine with fine paper to buff it   Thanks
Got to say you have done a brilliant job 👏
Why the idea of suing GLOLS CLEAR COAT and when should I apply it  ?
How much does this typically cost to have someone else do?
Excellent tutorial, excellent result.  Respect!!
Thomas, I see that this is an old video, but if you're still reading these comments could you tell me where you obtained the matching spray paint?  The only matching paint I could find for my Acura is one of those dealer sold touch up kits in a small tube with a brush. Please advise.  TIA. By the way, you did a fantastic job!
Great job. You now have a legion of DIYers.
Where’s your daddy 😂😅
How would you color😊 mach??
Awesome ...subbed
nice~!
You forgotten to calculate your labour costs. 🐨
I learned more in 15 minutes than what I learned in auto body school. Great!!
you need more clear coats on there. It's still not shiny and won't protect the paint for long.
Who is watching this in 2023 to repair your wife’s or girl car ? Save your money 💰
Thank you!! You really gotta trust the process though
Omg.  The humor 😅 that shit was so funny, yet so informative.   Gonna do this to my car!
Great video! Very descriptive and thorough. I have a couple of spots to fix on my Mazda 3.
Good, and funny!
Where do you get all of the items that you used to your car?
Which hardener did you use for miss w the body filler? It’s not listed on ur links.
This is a very helpful video. I have two scrapes on my black Mercedes E550, one along driver's side lower entry panel and the other right rear fender well from a parking garage pillar. These instructions should allow me to fix them myself. Thanks!
nice! Might try this.
I have a metallic black paint, would it be fine if I used any sandable primer?
Will this be a car that has a metallic color
Where do you get the base color (psc)??
What the hell man? I followed your instructions and it did not turn out good at all
Finally got the courage to do this. Looks alot better. Definitely a day project. Everyone doing this. Take your time and do it in doors. Will be easier and save more spray lol thanks man. Will eventually do my other scratches
This videa is great but how about sanding the clear before compounding?
bruh… i scraped my tesla sos !!!
dude, thanks for sharing. An student driver scratched my car and now my insurance is asking me to pay the first $500. Crazy. I'll repair this myself, also, I love learning how to do this kind of stuff. Your car looks beautiful
Which clearcoat did you use the maxx 2k or the automotivetouchup house brand?
Me watching who don't have a car 😅😅😅
Can I do this work in my Condo Garage or should I do it outside in open?
Thanks for your video But i am sorry to ask, renault 2012 megane colour paint is not available in the link🥲
What’s the brand for sand ale primer,basecoat Color?
If you could only fix the sound on your video.
Very good job, I'l pay you $350.00 to fix mine..same location & damage..
This is so impressive!! I’m inspired
Man, cannot thank you enough for this. Helping out a friend with his rav 4, in the exact same spot.
Me😢
Lmao you had me dying throughout this video. Shit looks good too 👌🏽
Robot voice Infomercial?
I got paint fix and it look good now, have not apply the polish yet. But the surface is not smooth. Can I sand it with 2500 paper (or higher) and apply the polish?
!WAO! nice job like a pro👍 those $800.00 stay home.😝
Amazing job!
What is the material cost of this?
great video! May I ask which step brings back the gloss? I followed the video but ended up a somewhat matte finish that should be glossy and reflective. I've sure the clearcoat was glossy one.
👍🙏
Hi brother , if you are in united states, where do i buy the materials ?
I’m doing this! Thanks for sharing
Nice 👌
You could bring the budget down to like 50$
Damn hella needed this. My baby has a little scratch on it from me rubbing against the wall
Does this work if there’s deep scratches, obviously it won’t make it look like before but I don’t want to deal more damage than what was done
Thanks for the video, and the humor ! Is it ok to paint just that area - and not the whole bumper ? The place where the new paint & clear coat meets the old paint & old clear coat - does not it show ? If not -what is all this noise about blending ? Could you please elaborate on that ? Thanks !
WOW ! Great video and thankx for sharing ! 😀
Bro why the porn music in the video 😂😂
Does the sandpaper really to have be 80 onwards til 2500 grit? Can I use like a lower grit range?
O man this is really professional job done. I will not be able to do that myself 😢😢😢
Someone hit my car while it was parked and left. Gonna try this out tomorrow🙏🏼
That Sand paper grit is OVER 9000!
Awesome video brother & damn good work.
After watching this, I decided to leave it to the pro
nice but it looks a little matte compared to the rest of the car. missing a gloss clear top layer? or more polish
Loved the video, thank you
am dead as hell i just scratched my grandfather new car he bought yesterday. I'm finna be homeless
First time watching this guy very interesting and entertaining while he teaches us
This is awesome just what I was looking for, BEST car paint instructions on YouTube, and humorous.
PRO!
Who is watching this after some bitch scratched their car😂
Someone hit my car today so I’m here
Would you recommend using an electric grinder instead of manually with your hand?
You mentioned "lighter sandable primer" (3:17)  where can I get this or are you referring to the original paint colour for your car that you used?
as I should have expected it seems that I messed up
https://youtube.com/shorts/QZ97ULmrR3Q?feature=share
Hi appreciate the video which site did you bought the paint etc??
Hiya, do you need to have both primer and gloss clear coat afterwards ? Or can you do it without it and just use everything else
😎👍. Cooool!
Just found you! Beautiful results on your vehicle!
2:12 how did you mix ?
Excellent job
Stop missing the big part of the Cake! Create your own Brand Kit, create a website and sell it (The traffic is aready generated from this video).  This is Solid Tutorial and it's pain in the $ass to buy things separatly especially for DIYers.
6:09 Powerful… thanks!!!
How long did they take to send you the paint? I order some and they didn't send a tracking number.
Great job brother
That was dope af will try this thanks 🙏
I started watching this to learn how to repair the scratches but I stayed till the end for the entertainment value as well Great job overall!
The dab😂 good job
Some asshole hit my car while parked but paying a $250 deductible is to much for the size of the scratch
Do i drink the water or not?
Amazing work done 😮
My little brother just scratched my WV golf, I need to know the list of things I need to buy,
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂Your "technic" requires "MANY" Skills & Not everyone can do it @ Home. Easy for ppl to mess it up W/ Spray paint job. Why not turn it into body shop..it is what it is
Your text fade game is a little too strong my friend
I missed the clear coat..
Shouldn’t u do the whole bumper? I have a silver metallic car that is scratched up on the side sgould I do thewhole bumper to match the colour? 2011 car so faded paint might be a problem idk?
Like it never happened
Excellent video........Thank you very much
Watched this and decided to go back to the body shop. They earn their money!
To 1 malade bro! Thanks!
Hi Thomas, we liked the paint Repair you applied and did super job. Thanks for going into details when taping this video ❤❤
3:12 Just give him an Oscar
Who is watching this after getting their car scratched? 😅
6:01 ouch, you can clearly see the scuffs thru the paint 8(
Hmmm not sure that rubbing compound clear coat and polishing the clear coat would result in the right finish, last few seconds showing the whole car doesn’t show clearly enough the colour match and shine, so I’m calling this BS.
My same caaaarrrrr!!!
Bro drink some water during your video your constant dry tongue sound is absolutely horrible
Great job.  I'm in the middle of doing some repairs on my Chevy now.  I was wondering why you didn't use a clear coat, but chose to buff instead?  Anyway, it looks fantastic.
Good stuff brother!!!!
Great work. Couple questions. You did 3 coats of primer but how many base coats and how many clear coats did you use? Thanks!
Very nice… will try to get my son to do this to his new car.
Thank you Thomas, very helpful tutorial video. Very simple and easy directions to follow. After watching your video, I will fix all the scratches on mycar. I also subscribed to your channel 👍
Nice job!!
EXCELLENT! 😄
i did fuck upp my mopped
I don't have car but still watching... 😅😂
Just better send it to a repair shop
Very good video
I have this issue on my rear bumper, I've wanted to do it myself but man I am not very patient!   Nice work!
Great 👌 job 👍 looks like new again thank you for your help big thumbs up Dave
You just saved yourself $150 bucks!
Who’s watching this after their wife scratched their car
Give the seven hundred to body shop guy and help our economy .
for the viewers before applying primer sand everything. otherwise you can just peel it of after one stone chip. if you just spray of unsanded paint like he did
what do u do if the scratch is inverted like a small bump?
This is not true dishonest.
That turned out awesome  I'm gonna try it
Can you please send the primer link
idk if someone will see this but does this work with all car colours??
This proves you don’t have to paint an entire section. Although you do have to match colors well. My black is no longer the same black as when I first bought it new.
Though it would depend on the type and size of scratch, but still even $120 isn’t cheap either.
Cool
I didn’t scratch it. Someone hit my car while it was parked!
Just have one question. Could you have used finishing paste-like ones that come out of a tube?
excellent
I know this video is old but damn is it informative. I’m trying to repair a big scratch on my car and I have been watching YouTube videos all week. Although all were helpful, my problem was finding the right paint color for my car. Every product I found was just “universal” paint, and let’s be real, not all cars have the same “white” paint job😅. I ended up buying an AC delco product from Amazon that is labeled “white pearl”. It’s set to be delivered on Wednesday of this week.. but then lo and behold. I find your video which had a link to a website that sells automotive paint. 😭😭😭 I guess my dumbass should’ve thought to Google the paint itself 😂 but I guess I thought I’d leave it to YouTubers to give me recommendations instead lol. Anyways, thank you so much for posting this video. I will now go and buy the correct paint for my car. 😄I’ll make sure to have my phone next to me and watch this video step by step when I attempt to fix my car. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I have a good car insurance, I don't need this bullshit
I used my dad car while he wasnt in town without him knowing...i scraped a bit of the back left hamd side (about 15 cm long) while coming in the driveway...im freaking out...i have no cash and he comes back in 2 days...any ideas??

i ain’t doing all that man thank you for the tips tho u a goat
How much  time spent?
Lot of arm work ...could you not use a buffer wheel in there somewhere,?  Good looking job  👍 😉
jesus christ my car looks worse than it did with the scrape and I don't even know where I went wrong
Why wet sand after primer? Thanks
For anyone who tried this, how much did it cost for all the supplies?
😊
Yeah in watching this bc a pole hit my car out of someone's truck
Thank you for sharing
How did you match the right colour?
Impressive
That was excellent!
After buffing your arms are now buffed 😂
Great job well done
like it
My wife just scratched our Dodge Challenger but I’m gonna practice on my 350z first. We broke out here thanks for the video
Did something similar but ran the hose to under the throttle body, didn’t have to remove the intake & don’t run the risk of the Vacuum line freezing in cold AB (-40) also it does not not have the upgraded rings & still works good.
Cool video , dab on em 😂
Great job Bruh...you can open up your own paint repair shop.perfect results
Where did the clear coat go ????
magic!  very well done!
Degenerate scraped me at work!?
Great video. But, what if we mess it up? What do we do then?
Can anyone help or advise please? I have spray painted and once it has dried, I can see  the filler through the paint. I have done 3 coats again but the filler is showing on some parts. Can you tell me what I can do. Thanks
Very nice job man. Absolutely perfect! Will these methods work on the main body metalwork?
A cut from Toy Story 2 elevator scene Belt Buzz and Zurg fight
Too quiet  I cannot hear
Most of this I definitely understand and think I can do, the one thing that kinda confusing me is getting the new paint and clear coat to look like it blends in with the original paint.
i got an a car crash my mom was leaving the parking lot and got a sraches from the back
If car is cheap then you fix yourself of course.
how much would it cost to get this done?
Subscribed because of your humor and knowledge. Got myself a project for the spring!
Hi I am fixing some deep scratches in my car. I am new in this. I found all the product except the sandable primer,and gloss clear coat. I really appreciate if someone can post the Amazon link of the same. Is the base coat colour is the same as matching colour of the car? Thanks
Does this work for plastic as well as metal?
Result turned out nice, i would only worry that the whole surface wasn't scuffed prior to priming and painting it should be fully scuffed not just the repaired spots, but only time will tell if it eventually peels in places
Great job ….
It seems as though you had somewhat deep scratching. Is that why you started off with dry sanding?
Who watching this after scratching their parents car
How can i fix the car scratches with nissan murano black car on the passengers side... Any tips?
First video I saw of yours  And loved it the edit and everything 👌🏼
WOW good job bro 👍🏼
I wish I could learn this trick before trade in my car cheap. I am not a bad driver but as night shift worker parking in dark area, I was so tired not to see the big pole and I am elderly as well. So it is my defending 😂😂
Watched cause I’m a bad driver. Subscribed for the comedy.
Thomas: remember that glass of water, I used it to wet the 800 grid sand paper. Me: Nooooooo
Amazing job and tutorial thanks. Can I ask what your total cost was for products
I’m hurt. I think someone scraped my car 😂 😂😂 now I’m here.
THANK YOU , Great overview and answered my questions. Now to see if I can be as professional as you are.
This is the funniest diy car video I’ve ever seen 💀😂🤣
Learned the hard way not to paint in sub 65F temperatures.  Days of work down the drain. Might be good to mention this so newbs like myself don't waste time and money.
Watching cuz some scum hit n ran my car
KILLED IT DADDY
Looks great! Amazing job
All the people watching this video are angry and upset as they have just scratched their car...like me. Sure hope this works. 😂😬
Who’s brand new car and deep scratched and watching w/me? 🙄 Lol
Great video. Thanks
Hmmm, other videos say wait for primer to dry 30m between coats and overnight after last coat.
Do we need the hardener for the body filler 😢
That's a lot of work and I'm lazy 🥱
To everyone doing this first time. Please wear mask and goggles.
This is the best video out there. Only problem I had was I oversprayed the primer so it left marks on my car. The best way I removed it was using tea tree/eucalyptus oil to remove the primer and it came off amazing. You’re the best my man
Is it fine if I sand down the whole area before bondo?
Lmaooo dude hellla funny. Didn’t expect the humor.   Absolutely great job on the repair   “Buffed” 💪🏼
Thanks for the detailed demonstration! I scuffed my bumper yesterday, and I'd rather gain new skills than pay money I don't have. I'm looking forward to this job.
Yo Bratha your vedio helped me alot, you made whole thing so easy for me.  Blesssed man  …………….   May lord bless you bratha  ❤
I love your video, but how do you match the finish of the new clear coat, to the original clear coat? I tried something similar and my new clear has an obvious matte finish.
You did a half ass repair. You put LACQUER spray can paint over factory BASE/CLEAR. You did a quicky repair is all.
Great Job 🤗🤗🤗🤗Thanks for sharing 👍👍👍👍
I've painted the primer coats, did you paint only 2 coats per base coat and clear coats? Also is it mandatory to let it sit overnight before applying compounding or a few hours is enough? Thank you
You make repairing scratches on a vehicle look effortless . I can’t wait to repair the eyesore scratches on the rear of my car . Thank you for sharing. Once I repair my car. I will share before and after results. Thank you. Wish me luck 👍🏻
great job Thomas, congrats on the final finish
Hilarious 😂😂😂😂 Definitely added some joy to my day. Great video!!!
I am your Daddy 😂
I'm on a kick, bringing my truck and my wife's car back to "new".  There is very little actual damage (less than yours) and, because if what I just saw you do, I am confident I can take card if all of the scratches and small spots missing paint.  EXCELLENT VIDEO!!
Honestly the hardest part is making sure the bondo is smooth with no lumps or cracks. How would we start over if the bondo is all lumpy and cracky on some parts and it has dried? Just sand it down again from the beginning? Best sand grit paper to start from starting from messing up?
hudai
Awesome dude
I watched you several times. I think?? I have the nerve now to fix my scratches on my car, good job! I hope I do as well, I'll let you know LOL LOL
Yeah I’ve got to repair in my 2016 Focus with only 30K on it. My supervisor at work was backing up the company truck and one of the utility doors was open and high-fived my car three times. He told me that the door was open when he was backing up, but didn’t have the common curtesy to specify which side, and maybe we need to check your car out for possible damage. I go to wash my car Saturday and wouldn’t you know it…I’ve got white paint scratch on my front fender, all the way across my driver side mirror, and a nice white scratch on my rear driver side door. God I felt so disrespected by the lack of transparency and honesty by my supervisor. I just lost all respect for him! I had zero scratches on my car until now.
YOU DON'T BASH OR  SCRATCH  YOUR CAR.ISUALLY OTHER IDIOTS DAMAGE YOUR CAR FOR YOU AND SCARPER.FREE OF CHARGE!
This video is exactly what I was looking for, thank you! 🙌 Plus it gives me more confidence to see other positive  comments by people who seem to know what they're talking about.  I haven't seen any of your videos before, but I'm subscribing for your humor 😜   Now, I'm off to go click some of those affiliate links, I'm done researching.  Well done.
Thanks
Does this work on metal like a quarter panel or only on plastic bumpers?
I hope ppl get the right coat of paint. Some car manufacturers have just that slightly different shade of color that you might not anticipate till you spray paint your car.
I think I can actually do this. Thanks.
Excellent video! Concise and very informative. This gave me the confidence to try doing it myself.
Thanks for the video. Ended up with great results.
pls mention the grate of emery paper too in detail.
Na it looks Matte finish
That was a pretty good job. Nice
Great content. Videoed well. Liked the tiny humor breaks. You should have taken a second glass of water to drink if you are getting buff.
I usually consider any nonsense to be a waste of my time, but you seem to have the perfect ratio of business and nonsense. The thing with the respirator was hilarious and the practical info was perfect!
Some asshole hit my new camaro w a shopping cart at night and since my car is black it shows the white scuff and scratches are
Hello, I sprayed duplicolor primer, base and clear coat after I thought paint was ready to clear coat. Some part was not covered adequate with base. Question, do you think if I went sand the clear coat, can I repaint and apply clea coat?
Damn you killed it. Great job and video
Hello, does the primer have to match the colour of your car?
That is almost exactly my car scrape except for being on the rear area. 👍🏼
Good job
Excellent tutorial! But I've already applied the base coat onto the scratches before watching this video, do I need to first sand down the applied base coat now before following the tutorial?
Wow! So excited!!!
Only a minute and 50 seconds in I’m subscribed lol
Hi, Thomas! I couldn't help but notice that you've done it so easy. I was really amazed. I really like it. Now, I would like to try it myself since side panel scratches really bothers me but I'm faced with this dilemma on whether to buy a generic pearl white spray paint via hardware or online. The color specifics is qx1 z (aspen pearl white.) I hope you don't mind but is there any better way to solve this? I'm just worried how will it turned out if I didn't get the exact spray paint I'm looking for. Please advise. Tnx.
Nice job buffy the scratched bumper slayer!    Lol
What clearcoat would you recommend? The one I wanted off automotivetouchup is sold out. It's the missing piece I need before starting my repair. Awesome video by the way and great humor.
I try to keep my car in good condition but--after 6 years of ownership--I made the mistake of parking to close to the garage door (for the first time EVER). I closed the garage door and heard the SCRATCH as it sawed a big gouge in my rear bumper. I don't want to pay 100s or 1000s (I've got other deep scratches on one wheel arch) so I think I may try this! Thanks!
Why do the tires look different in the before and after at the end? The rims look different in my opinion... Lol
My technician is telling me to repaint the entire bumper to get good results, what do you think ? I have similar scratches as yours
https://youtu.be/Ypf5l4EgKOU
This is like magic 😂
Would you say this process works even if the scratch is down to the metal layer?
To the Van driver that hit my car and ran away I hope your engine coolant bursts and engine overheats to a point of no repair.
Here in the Philippines a quality repaint job like that will only cost you $50.
Never sand to 2500 before paint lol
Invaluable
Awesome!!!
Do more repairing videos such how to remove benty doors, waxing headlights👌🏽💯 thanks for this!! Gonna do it next week,
What primer did you use…it’s not on that list
For the best cleaning of the surface use isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol). it pulls small debris onto the microfiber towel and dries faster than water.
Haven’t done the compound and polish yet. It’s still a bit rough do is it supposed to be this way?
It was very helpful
10/10 Fw the color💬 sum to have in mind  🔜
Don’t forget to wash the area with soap and water and let it dry before starting
Well,to be honest, it worked for my car. I got rid of nearly all of my car scratches easily.If you're intrested which product I used, you can check here guys: https://www.carscratchrepair.co/order-today
Absolutely amazing man!!!
I scuffed much pain against my brick fence from my drive way.
Thank you, will try
That's pretty good man, but my experience tells me it's harder then you make it look. I think the difference might have been the water versus the booze or whatever it is I use when I'm working on my car
Great video.  Does the sandable primer need to approximately match the final colour of the car? Or will any primer be ok?  Thank you
Not too sure about spraying over paint with primer and then painting that on top.
Great stuff
I got In a hit in run two days ago, damn this helped
Too much work.. too much time
Just got my brand new car for 2 months and someone scratched my car in a parking garage 😩 😡 like f*%king learn how to drive!!!
Do you know how to smooth the paint at the edge after removing the tap ?
Yall my neighbor passed by looking so fine and I scratched my car 😭😭😂🫡
I srtached my dads car and I’m not old enough to drive  I hate my life what do I do it’s not that bad I’m crying it’s new 2022 hybrid Camry
Where did you get your supplies from
Bruh I just scared my shit parallel parking. Road rage got me fkd up
How much does it cost?
How hard is this on a scale 1-10
Great job sir.
Excellent instructions! I am now “empowered” to fix my fender scratches (they look exactly like yours). Thanks!!!!!!!!
Where to buy the color spray paint
Followed every step and am delighted with the finish. Saved me hundreds of pounds on a bumper, wheel arch and door!! Great video!!
What do you think about using Rust-Oleum Automotive 257884 11-Ounce Enamel Spray, Gloss Clear?
Impressive! THank you for sharing !
The paint producer is an American company. Does someone know how to buy these paints in Canada or similar products ? Many thanks
nice job!
what is the brand for paint respirator that you were using? cost?
Wow
Thank you, Thomas of all trades, after watching your video I will start repairing my Mothers car scratches she just acquired on Saturday.
today i got up and went to wash my car i saw that my bumper was badly damaged no dents but super scratched up paint missing and all that it probably happened when some one was leaving the parking spot idk who did it there are cameras but i have a flight to night i just took it to the shop and the guy said that this bumber is way too scratched up for a touch up and needs full repaint i told him that i dont have money of that sort to fix it he told me he can do something he fixed it using his fingers and paint it looks good from far but ok from near idk what to do now my is  car gmc yukon denali new one and now the bumper looks okay but noticable what do i do now ?  i thought i might have done it but i think you will definitely notice a damage of that sort when driving so yeah super sad day
Wow
How about colored bumper … I scratched my purple Mazda today………
كيف بدي اعرف دهان سيارتي
How do you paint just a small section? When i mask off the surrounding area for a small square section i want to paint i can always see a square outline where i painted when i remove the tape even though i fill, sand and use the same color
If the scratches aren't deep and you don't need to use the filler, can you still follow these instructions but skip the filler part?
I just got scratch on my uncle's car. Now I am watching this video to remove it. 😂😂
Thank you for showing me how to do this.
Is it bad or good if I go to the carwash before doing this?
Superb tip thank you so much. This really helps.
I uh- scratched my mom’s van. She knows but I want to make it right. She won’t let me pay for it but she’s mad
Was the base coat paint  mix with clear coat all in one. Noticed clear coat wasn't apply after painting, instead went to using compound than finishing with polish wax.
Just scratch front bumper on my first car, my Subaru and I am crazy about it. So here i am😃
This was great video! Thank u!
do i need body filler? Im not sure when to use body filler
Yess!!👏👏 Thank you!! Great easy to follow video and I love your personality and humor! Thanks again for the video! I'll be trying this soon!!
Key is the spray paint. My car paint is water based and that itself costs $400
I was driving my rental car and the thing got dented from a little love tap with the true next to it. I was freaking out because I had to return it within the next two days and I knew my dealership was about to charge me so much to fix it along with other fees but my friend recommended this place in wisconsin called acci-dent and they do same day paintless dent repair. I brought it in and got it back within the same day and it looked good as new. I have never been so relieved, plus it was a fraction of the cost. So thankful companies like this exist
I just went looking for such a touch up video, chose yours first, that was very well done, and funny!!
XD hilarious! hope my car looks as good as yours did 🚗
What is the best color match paint brand?
Good job 👏
Got in my first fender bender. Gotta catch up on all that studying now😏
Just crashes my Cadillac a tiny bit .. thanks for the tip
Literally have the same car, EZ PZ👌🏼😎
Thank you for making this video. My cost was $120.66! Only $0.66 more than what was shown here! I am waiting for a day that is not humid like today is to start the project! I subscribed and will comment back when I am finished with the project!
Saving it for a day when I'll have enough scratches to do it all in one go. you can like this comment to remind me that. thanks
Will definitely save the video for later, when will try fixing scratches on my car
This is wild! I have two left hands for anything repair oriented but your instructions make believe that even, I, too, can repair a ding on my car!
2:38   It doesn't appear that the body filler patch was adequately sanded (i.e. feathering) prior to priming. And the spot was sanded without the use of a flexible block?
Great job!
Looks easy bet it’s not as it look
Great job that awesome
Ya boy here after scratching his car in a parking lot 🥲
Amazing job!👍👍
Awesome video, really appreciate your info.
I subscribed at the "glass of water"
Does the sandable premier has to be the color as the vehicle?
Any idea on the products he used, im dying to find the same exact type of primer, basscoat he used
It looks rubbish lol, will you come and do mine.... good job.
Looks great! I appreciate the humor that you sprinkled throughout this video.
Amazing video!! I have my whole front hood where the paint is chipping out. Can I use you method to repaint the whole front hood? Or maybe repaint the whole car.
Where do we order the paint?? Good video 👍
Excellent job
So you are telling me i can spray paint it with the same similar color as my car?
Are you using the ready to spray cans or the aerosol cans from your link?
$800!!! Nooooooooo!!!!
Some SOB sideswiped my rear left bumper today at a traffic signal
Best touch-up vid on youtube. This really helped me. Thanks
I did it exactly like the video. And the end result looks dreadful. This video is a lie.
Hopefully this works on my mirror man ):
Koji kurac ne prevodite ove video snimke na srpski jezik????
Who is watching after their wife scratched your car? 😂😂
Your video has given me confidence to fix all the scratches on my car put there by each one of my six children when they we're learning to drive🤦‍♀️.
I live in Cincinnati Ohio where do I actually get the supplies from I don't have really deep scratches like you have you can fill them with your fingernail but you can't like stick your fingernail in them and my neighbor like little fine scratches over the car so I want to just basically touch the car up where can I get the supplies from. Please reply
Good as new!!
I was a professional dealership detailer for years and the work you showed on the video any dealership would welcome and hire you as a detailer employee and paint and body shops. Great work. High quality brand name with Carnauba Wax or liquid glass would be good to bring back a shine base match to original paint coat shine then a nice electric high speed buff to make that shine sparkle again. Awesome job
This guy right here 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾.
Just scratched my Suzuki Swift 😭... I hope this help but will never be the same :'((((
Hilarious but very great job
For a 2inch by 2inch section, will this work? And how do I know how far out to paint or should I just tape off only the area that needs to be touched up?
Thank you! Someone just scratched my car and I was really furious. It's so annoying how you take care of your car and some people are just so clumsy or whatever and just scratch somebody else's car. I'll try this process.
Excellent video. I now feel confident about tackling similar scratches on my new car
That's alotta sanding
Too funny. I stay with a scrap on my car
The stupidass water joke made me laugh hahahaha
You can just come do mine for me...T.I.A
Excellent work mate!
lol this was funny.. great video man..
How do you color match though? I have a black metallic crystal. If I used register black, it would def show!
You could also wet sand your final product with 3k grit before buffing to flatten out the paint and make it blend better
Great job!  Thank you so much 😊
You funny thank you
Great Job great info
I need to repair my bumper i scratched it underneath
IMPRESSIVE!! Nice job. Nice presentation.
Good and Funny Video, The Part Buffing was funny lmao....Good Job Thomas..
Do bumpers require a flex additive to allow some bending, before cracking?
i am trying this soon wish me luck
Hi I’m back here yet again 😅😅 but now  i can see the borders where I put the tape on when painting. Is there a way to kinda just even out the paint so there’s no borders where the oem paint is and the new paint I applied is?
Very inspiring and nice job, on the paint, and the very informative video 👍🏽🔥
still rather just pay someone. Time is money
Your jokes are not funny.  No one came here to see your rubbish jokes.  You are. NOT a comedian
I too was hot and a chilled glasses of water. Great video!
my only concern is that did drink that glass of water ?
This is good enough for the everyday Joe but that finish was far from perfect. That bumper lost a lot of its shine. Still good result for the relative price.
Toooooo much work !!! Can't do it
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 got dammmmmmn !!!! Gonna try 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I have no car but still i am watching
guarantee this paint doesn't match at all, and this repaired area is plainly obvious to anyone whos looking in direct sunlight.  Silver in particular is notorious for being difficult to match.  Blending paint, and matching factory orange peel is very difficult to do.  Overall the process followed here is mostly correct, but ideally you don't want to sand your primer with anything higher than 400-600 grit if you want your basecoat to adhere properly.  If you want the paint to last longer, better to use urethane based solvent (or water base) and spray via gun or airbrush.  The acrylic paint that is typically in the rattle cans isn't up to lasting years in the open elements and being pelted with rocks on the highway, and the nozzle in the cans do not spray very well (typically) so your finish quality will vary when using these cheaper materials. Autobody labor and materials is expensive for a reason. Spraying itself is a technique that is very difficult to master, you can't be too close or too far away, or too slow or too fast.  Too light of a spray will result in a rough textured finish, too heavy will cause the paint to run and drip. You have to apply just enough paint that it is nice wet, without dripping.
i don't have to worry about scratches because i don't have a car because i don't need one.
Just pay the 800...you will be able to tell you got a spray can and did it yourself. Idk how many cars I see with people doing this...
Lol over-spray all over the body. There's no clear coat. There's a reason you take it to a body shop. This is a "Mickey Mouse" job
That’s a lot of work over two plus days especially if you don’t know what the heck you’re doing which can end up making the car look worse because of a lousy touch up paint job
🤣 Water! I like it! I appreciate your humor
For the people that attempt this time-consuming nightmare,  1. Read the other people's comments with tips and their learning lessons.  2. If you're doing all of this outside, THE WIND IS YOUR ENEMY! Blew crap on my work after I just started the gloss phase 🥲... So do it in a nice sheltered area or tape down/remove anything that can be blown by the wind.  3. If you've never painted before, use painter's tape only in areas where paint is not supposed to be (e.g. headlights, windows, plastic areas). Don't put tape on the body of the car if it's meant to have tape. I taped only around the small area that was damaged in a rectangular shape. After removing the tape, I saw paint ridges formed around the tape in a rectangular shape, which was noticeable as when it was scratched 🙃...
Did this shit without gloves and now my hands look like a Dalmatian 🥲
$1.5k now for a gas car!  $5k for a Tesla! SMDH!
Hell of a job man. I’ll most likely be using this
How to remove car scratches. First step, scratch it some more 😂
Great job. I plan to this too
Aint nobody got time for this jkjkjk
Love the humor in this video.
By the end of the list of items needed, I think I will pay instead screwing my car
after I'm realized the car is more shinier than before then I'm switched to 360p
Hey u uses no rust converter,cold gal , or primer - will your repair here rust soon if living near the ocean?
.....mmm  I thought that you need the fresh paint to dry for 30 days before waxing it
I think you did a good job mate!
Great job. Instantly went and bought everything. Good little weekend project. Saving this video 👍
I did mine easier way by driving it to a auto body shop and it came just like new
How long does it take please ?
How did you find the matching paint base color?
noice
As professional car painter I do not recomend this. Sanding paper 80 for plastic. Really? I watched more. 2000 2500 is good for polishing. This has 6m views and I can write essay what is done wrong and what is crap...
$120 dollars + your time. You forgot about the hours?????
Clean!!!
Awesome video! Thanks! Do you have a link on the primer you used?
for an extra hundred you could buy a buffer lol it would save time and youd have it for next time. And there is ALWAYS are next time ..
Materials = $ 120 Labor = $50/hr for 8 hrs Total = $ 570 + taxes
I dont even have a car
Really enjoyed and am inspired by your video. Muchos gracias mi Amigo.
Good effort  great result
Anyway, you can see that there is painted. Missing shine
I belive extra $680 are charged by painting shop for 6 hours of work and taxes:-)
Nice job!
I could watch you all day 😂
Good job there mate
buy a microphone
I CANT HEAR YOUUU!!!
You can see the paint doesn't match. It would look even worse in the correct light.
Epic!
My car full of scratches....
I know you watching me..and im watching you back
I can give you one more piece of advice. How to fix a crack in a windshield? Buy a new windshield and replace it.
Thank you for the share.
Man, u rock.
On second thought the scratches arent so bad.
I would personally save hundreds by not caring. It's even better than what you will suggest.
Great video! I highly recommend to people to use a 2K product for the clearcoat.
Thank you for the excellent quality of production. You are lightyears ahead of the competition!!!!
I will spend $800..
Hahahaha, its almost not possible to match new colour with old one and this guy hasn't faded anything. Pure bulshit
Hey what prevents the newly painted area from being more noticeable and standing out compared to the rest of the car?
Hats off young man.
I prefer to remove scratches than repair them, makes the car look better without them
You will never get a successful result. Let it go and repaint the whole piece when you have time and money.
Damn that looks pretty amazing and how it blends with original color without painting the whole part.
My grandfather was right behind my car with his car and he fucked my whole bumper 🤣🤣
OMG so unprofessional. If u want bad result do it like him
Process is right, but even on camera i can see difference between old color, and new color. I think you wouldnt take car from painting, painted like that quallity even if  they ask only 120 bucks????
Looks alot easier in this video than actually doing it
Great talking, plenty of info, beautiful shots, masterful work.
To make it 100% correct, you should not jump sanding papers more then 1/2 of previous size. So if you start with 80 grid, next one is + 1/2 or 80 + 40 = 120. After 120 you go to 120+60=180. By skipping you leave small irregularities on surface area that can not be removed by higher grid number. You probably used  high quality spay which filled those irregularities and help you with good finish. It's always a risk to jump from 80 to 180 by skipping 120. Great job anyway.
Everything about this video is wrong. The biggest no no is that you don't blend clear into existing clear 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
An elephant did sit on my car. Can you polish it?
Now try doing this on a 10yr old metallic red!..
I dont know why is it so expensive in ur country i paid only 10 OMR (about 25 USD) to fix those deep scratches which was caused by hitting the corner of the wall while going reverse
Better bring to the service if you do not want to waste money to buy a lot of things, to do this you must have standard skills that’s not everyone can do!
Jaaaajajajajaja, si tengo que hacer todo eso, prefiero cambiar de coche!!!!
ma quello non è certo un lavoro da 800 dollari, costa molto meno, ed il lavoro da fare è quello, video cazzata...
This is nothing new
Tight!! Very good!!!
Great video dude I like your style and presentation too Buff those arms lol
Can I borrow your hands for couples of hours, I don't believe myself 😹
It is like showing how a pro would do it. Better let the pro do his job and earn some money doing it.
Job well done!
Good job bud , I do my own paint repairs too
Nice DIY but it has a few flaws (no hate just helping):   - When you apply a base primer (or any spray layer) make sure to press the spray head firmly to avoid any drops, spits or spills (as seen on 3:22). Sometimes you can get away with it as it may stay hidden under another layer or get sanded down later.  - When reaching corners always spray "over" the corners and away from the car. That way you won't create visible overlaps you'll have a hard time to work out the overlay so it won't be visible. The same goes with lines and edges. If you want a clean finish you gotta paint up to a specific line or edge where your stop won't be visible. You can try this yourself on something else. Like an old door or other stuff you can train your skill. If you stop halfway you will have visible overlays.   - Spraying your color code might disappoint you in the end. Some spray colors tend to look different from what you have on your car. This may come from the light you are using (LED, tungsten, dayling, etc...) and angle (some metallic paints reflect light differently making it hard to hit the right tone of your color. Another thing is your primer. Spray primers come in a lot of colors. White, yellow, brown, silver, gray and black. And maybe some other colors. The reason is simple - using a specific primer color will help you to hit a different tone with your color spray paint. If you have for example a red car and it has been standing outside for some years you'll be on a road to hell getting your paint right. Silver is also complicated.   - *Using putty* - use only as little as nescessary. The more you apply the more you have to sand down later. Meaning the space you demand in your 1st step will increase in each step. Suddenly you gonna find yourself working on almost a space 10x times bigger then you were looking at the beginning :D Reason is simple again - when you have to smooth out your previous step you have to blend it with the surrounding. And that blending in takes space.   - When using *clear coat* ALWAYS use 2K clear coat paint cans. BUT BE AWARE!!!! ALWAYS WEAR HIGH QUALITY FILTER MASKS WHEN PAINTING WITH 2K SPRAYS!!!! If you inhale 1K spray aerosols you are pretty much safe. It will take some time to get out but you'll be fine. 2K on the other hand MIGHT KILL YOU!!! 2K means it contains not only the paint itself but also a hardener. Usually the hardener is separated and you have to press some kind of button before you can shake the can so both compounds mix. And when you inhale that stuff it may very likely glue your lungs stiff. Google it if you don't belive me.   - Once you've done everything and the 2K clear has dried out propery then give it about a week or two to get back and polish it. Yes it may be dry to the touch but since you probably won't have a UV lamp to speed up the process then let nature do the work for you and wait. Once that time is up you are ready to finish your work by polishing it. Depending on your skills (or how much you trust yourself or how much you bother to get it done) you can take: 1) a simple polishing compound and just polish the hell out of it or 2) very fine sand paper for wet sanding to remove most of your orange peel look and then polish it with some compound to a shiny clear coat finish. You can see in the video that the finish is very matt finish which is not what you are looking for :) but Thomas of All Trades did a good job of using his camera at angles where it doesn't look that obvious :D but if you know what to look for you  will see it instantly :) again - no hate just tips to help. If I wanted to hate I'd just press thumbs down and left some negative one line comment. But why would I do that?   - Last point - *price*. Why do paintshops charge you 800 USD when you can do it for 200 USD? SImple - 200 is for the rent, 200 is for tools and material, 200 is for taxes and 200 is what is left over. When I say rent I mean literally everything that is building- and property wise included not just the actual rent itself. The same goes for other "200" bits so please don't go into details here as this is not the point. And now what is left for you is the last 200 and here you have to really look out where you can save some cash. Lets say material. You work a lot so you can afford to buy bulk. BUT you gotta give your customers some guarantee (which you want for yourself as well because who doesn't want happy customers right?). Thus you gotta buy high quality stuff only. Now you gotta find the line where cost and quality is on par so you still save some bucks but you still maintain quality. But don't worry. As soon as you found your golden sweet spot the supplier will increase his price one day leaving you to consider what to do with that. Stick with your prices or raise accordingly to level out the buy price? The same goes for material, rent, taxes... everybody will at some point want more. And you have to play ball or find other ways how to cope with that so you don't lose customers. All that and more is something you DO NOT have to consider when you think "this is too expensive I can do it cheaper". Yes you can. And the paintshop could too. If the paintshop would not have to pay all of the mentioned above :D There is a reason for some prices being where they are. Do not disrespect it just because you are not ready to pay it. In most cases there is a looooong story behind it that you just don't see (and now you got a glimpse of it). If you are not willing to pay for something then that is absolutely okay. Go and do it yourself but please do not disrespect people that have to do your one time job for a living each and every day on a highly professional basis with a lot of unknowns and risks to take care along the way. This I am telling you as a person who is doing almost everything on my own because in most times I do not want to pay others to do stuff I can do myself :) BUT sometimes I do go all out and simply pay someone to do something for me. And I do enjoy the result as well as the feeling that this time I didn't have to do it myself.   Allright.... now go out and do stuff :) take care :)
I'm sorry but this is a joke... This paint job will peal in 30 days time...
Emotionell damage  💯🤣
Good job. Looks like you blended in the clear coat.
Well done.
What type of Elbow Grease do you use?
UR a liar
Absolutely fantastic  . Suspect comedy but you did a great job .
WOW THANK YOU
I tried this myself and I ended up selling the car for parts. It's hard than it look.
Youtube just recommended this to me - nice video! I've done this process before, and would not use the fine grit sandpaper until after you have painted to improve your finish (before buffing), as the paint needs a texture to bond to. I'd use a two-pack (2K) clear on exterior panels, and when applying clear coat, it's quite difficult to blend into an existing prepainted panel, as it will have different thickness that's quite noticeable - consider painting clear on the whole panel (to the joins).
What about all the nasty spray can spitting at 3:24? It's just magically gone... 😂
I don’t even have a car.
Bello, ma inimitabile se non sei già un carrozziere.
That’s insane! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 I’m doing that ro my bumpers tomorrow .
awesome
you didnt put a clear coat on?
Would electrical buffer like orbital buffer tool be useful?
Looks really good
After watching this I decided to let the scratches be were they are.
To anyone not experienced in this field this may seem like a good tutorial but beware if you try to do this following his steps this will almost guarantee to fail. Proper products not used and other product used incorrectly, which will cause the paint to peel off after a couple months(most likely). Also no paint match done, just because you got the paint code does not mean its the right paint there are usually many variations of different shade and metallic variation, on my PPG system there's showing 21 different variants. Also taping in stuff like the black moldings and not removing them cause the clear coat not to go under them leaving an edge to the clear coat will is also prone to peels. Hand polishing clear coat is never recommended. Thats scrape is about a $500 job at our shop, I would say pay a professional the money and get it done right and never have to worry about it.
After five passes I realized I messed up my paint and have to pay $1200 to fix my fix😜!  Great job
this way you can keep your scratches intact!
Can I buy it from eBay or Amazon
Please do recommend me some good spray paint for polar silver
Time to get buff.
You have not mentioned about clear coat application, so when did you use that gloss clear coat ?
Yeaa.. My car surely do have it's scratches (and partial loss of paint completely🤣).. But I think I'll pass trying to fix it. My old car is a workhorse and not a show-off..🤣 No idea how this video appeared in my feed. I rarely looks at car related videos.. But I hope this video helped many that needed advice. Well done!!😊👍🏻👍🏻
All this work for Jeep?  C''mon man. JK awesome job
my front bumber is messed up. i need to do something
My car got hit on the parking lot by an illegal immigrant that was too lazy to drive around so he had to cross in between parked cars.... Then he just drove away :(
Just one idea (and admittedly I know this is old and I haven't watched your other vids) but you may want to leave itemized lists up on the screen until all items are displayed. Around 1:38 for example you wiped it before it was all up at the same time. I can't speak for anyone else but I like taking screenshots of things like that as a future reference. Anyway, awesome work man, you seriously killed it. Thanks for the vid.
This was not only informative but entertaining. Good job!!
What a work of love!
Haha loved your video. Great results too !
Looks good well done
No sound
Joli
I didn’t know you can get a can of paint that matches car colour. Thanks
So this was a plastic part, right? Not metallic?
So good! No wonder it cost $800 , a lot of steps 😂  But if we don’t have much to do! This is gold
@Thomas of All Trades -  wearing a _suitable_ mask while spray painting is good but _you forgot to_ remove ALL beard ( = shaving until your face is as slick as a woman´s face) , beards prevent the mask from making a seal !
Very interesting video 👍
Los que ello están planiando no joderan a todo
Los corredores venificiara ha uno y se pejudicaran el pueblo entero
Esto y se va apone que si tu no tienen tu beiculo en tu casa para salí ha buscar los que necesita se quedará uno sin que salí ha comprar los que necesita yo ando en el medio si no es necesario salí
Dude, awesome job. We seem to have less people every year that can fix their own things. Much respect.
My Miata mx5 1990 says thanks you sir my body is  o.k now 👌 !
it s still dull?
Good job!
It's 2022, and I found your vid very helpful.  THANK YOU for creating this vid. I didn't realize it was this easy.  Now to work on the scratches!  Thanks again!
You didn't count labour in the cost, once you count that you overpaid for that crappy job.  It depreciated your vehicle more than the difference between your rubbish job and a professional job because it appears the maintenance of your vehicle is poor.  I'd advise my customers to look elsewhere as this owner clearly cuts corners maintaining his vehicle and assumes his non oven baked, aerosol tin can garage finish that has loads of dry, peely finish and bad blending lines won't be noticed.
Great video!
Nice vid, thanks for sharing the trick
Nice job, looks professional..👍
Stupid people try to take ownership or entitlement to things they didnt work or earn
People who work hard and buy things it should not be scratched by envy haters u don't know how many hours people work to make car payments but we know you can negotiate with a jelouse psycho there is no logic to your hate except u feel entitled to what's not yours
Love the humor
bruh not me watching and looking the possible things that I can do without to cost more bucks. I finally now have an idea how to do it but it's my inner me saying that I need help from an expert at least not the "expert who could cost me a thousands" u know what I mean. Thanks so much for this insight. I might need to look the color of my car Lol
Looks great
Great tutorial. This is great cause I have to do this on my gals car. She drinks. (Kidding)
Many thanks, I used this same method to repair my scratched BMW at worked like a charm. Much appreciated
Great job explaining everything! Now I’m not so afraid to take in that project for my vehicle. Can you give the brand names of the paint, primer and clear coat?
One thing to remember about airasol  can clear there is no uv protection and it will not last. Repairs like this fade or crack and peel. Another thing   you need to take the bumper apart so paint can wrap around the full edge to prevent cracking if the bumper ever flexes. You also didn't need filler for those small scraches could of sanded those scrapes with 180grt then 320, then spraya plastic promoter let dry and prime far better repair less time and effort
Close!  But you don't need to sand the primer to that level. It is a waste of time.  You need to wet sand the coats of PAINT  with the super fine sanding between coats. Then clear coat, then polish. The hardest part is getting the right paint that will match.
if its a 2K paint car can we try the same process in painting
fantastic explanation
Then two weeks later it all peeled off and the body shop charged $900 to sort his mess out. Well done 👍🏼 don’t copy this process 🤣
Great detailed instructions. Thanks
Very nice but I doubt I could do such a nice job.  I do have scrapes and am tempted to try.
You,sir, are a national treasure, or at least a you tube treasure. Your presentation was concise, informative and accurate—a rarity on the internet! I have done patch jobs in the past, with indifferent results, but your video filled in the holes in my knowledge and I now fill confident in tackling the paint repair on my son,s car. Thanks a lot.
Great job!!
I might leave it scratched...
Great job, man.
It will take a newbie a good 4.5 hrs to get it done if not more
Your brilliant
Good job! However it felt like the original gloss finish is no more there in the fixed area.
Top video 👌👍
I also need a guy who will bring all those items from the market. 😂
All this for $120? What year is this video 1955? Come on bro
Instead show how to repair crashes it’s better to showing up how to drive more careful lol so you don’t have to work in repair cars
I had a similar damage to my car here in the uk. Took it to a bodyshop and had it fixed for 60 pound which makes around 80 dollars!
You left out a step - you polished the clear coat but not the paint under it.
Wow nice job
Was this metal plastic  or fiberglass?
Wow, looks fabulous/new.
Thanks I will try this.
Did you add a coat of clear?
I have a long scratch along the driver side , it was like that when I bought the car , not deep scratch but obvious if close by. Should I do it myself, with this video or or what must I do? Can you help on this?
I notice the "I'm your daddy" tee-shirts. Imagine the reactions should a woman wear one!🤣😂😅
NOOOOOOOOOO
Great job. One or two added ideas. 1. Use a bumper primer for your undercoat. This is a special plastics primer. Other primers don't adhere to the plastic bumper. These plastics have an oily like resin in them so the right primer is important. After priming apply your filler. Again there are plastic fillers that will stay on. Regular body filler won't esp if it's a large scratch or gouge in the plactic bumper. 2. Clear coat in the can (your final coat) is tricky to use if you want a high gloss that matches the existing gloss on the rest of the bumper. And you will need to put some effort into bringing out the gloss and blending it in with the existing paint.
Fn sic man great work 👏 👍
Sorry but I'm not picking on your work. It looks great but when spraying make sure you don't don't fan the spray can or spray gun. You face the nozzle at the surface and spray pay past the surface going from left to right and right to left. If you can the nozzle? You end up with more orange peel or like a dry feel as opposed to a smooth finish. Still great job tho.
This is a refresher for me. Over 20years since I did a full restoration of an old car.   I have to respray my wife's Mitsubishi ASX rear spoiler on the roof.  Cheers from Australia. Subbed and liked! 🙂👍👍👍
No ! I better pay for it , it’s not easy to do
Thank you so much! This video is super helpful
Really great work
Nice job!
Very nice! Good job 😊 I have paint chip blemishes on my 2020 Kia Soul..I’m too chicken to touch them..lol
Man I scratched my damn rental car. I’m about to do this for sure before I turn it in lol
Wow? How did you get the exact color in a can?
How about final laquer coating?
no sanding block?
How long did this take?
Will this method work on fibreglass parts as well?
My car was keyed.  On a warm day I used a black crayon to fill in the scratches then wiped the edges clean with my finger.  It lasts through car washes for about a year and then I do it again.  It has to be a warm day for the crayon to melt into the depth of the scratch.
Hey I did my car too and it was really good but that side is lacking shine from the rest of the car. What was the reason be and what can I do about it
Looks good! Sanding is so fun!😁
I felt stupid when I accidentally bumped the Tesla Model Y on a cement pillar. Sucks but I just got the Tesla paint and dabbed it around the scratches. It doesn't look as good as original but at least there's no scratches when you see it. If I had the skill and patience of this guy it would've looked nicer but the cost was too much to get it professionally done. Perhaps if someone could've done it for $200 like this guy I would've done it.
Hit and run gang checking in lol 😭 someone scraped my car overnight and left me a present. thank you SO much for this!!! You’re a lifesaver, and damn you did an amazing job on yours! I hope mine turns out half as good as that lol
Great 👍👍where u learn this ?
So neat and clean . You are a good learner.
Just go to a local garage they do it for you for free!!
Love it
Great video.  Clear instructions plus some light-hearted humour... perfect 👍  Time to tackle my bumper 🙃
How do you mix the bondo?
Excellent presentation and results.
Where did you get the materials particularly
Idk my paint my car doesn’t say it, it is a toyota corolla hatchback nightshade edition
You know all the girls in here
This is a very important video. Not everyone is skilled with machine buffing and knowing how to do this by hand can make a huge difference. I've seen too many people use the tool and end up gouging into their own hard work.
👏 great jobs
How do you match the exact color? Doesn't the new paint looks a little different from the rest of the old paint in the car? Thanks for this detail tutorial.
Nice work indeed! Have you tried repairing a wrapped bumper?
well done.
Awesome
Amazing
great video, i’d also recommend noting to wear the goggles and respirator while sanding as well.
Outstanding ...and pleasantly humorous!
This wasn’t the perfect video on the subject but this was the first that mentioned pricing and gave a link to a retailer to match paint. I also appreciated the instruction to look in the car door for type of paint. So although not perfect, none are and this had info I’ve not see elsewhere.
All good how to advice for do it yourselfers but a word to the wise here is do not use any type of "bondo" body filler on scratches, what you should use "glazing" . There are many types available and it is the right product to use, been doing bodywork for 40+ years.
Well your Asian, I'm sure you'll be doing these kind of repairs quite often, you did do a fantastic job on that repair. When your done with that car you will surely be a  qualified autobody repair  person.🤣🤣🤣
brilliant! Well done! Thanks for sharing!
Very informative and funny. 😄Thanks for sharing this.  I have some scratches on my car that I have to fix on my own because I am not paying someone $500-$1000 to fix it.  Thanks to you,  I'm confident that I can fix it on my own.  Thanks
This is a great video. Do you have a list of all of the products that you used? Also where they can be purchased at? Do you know where to purchase Tesla red paint? Thank you!
And if you do it wrong, the scratches are worse than before 🤣🤣🤣
Do I use the sandpapers wet or dry?
Did this to my car using a small hobby airbrush and paint out of a touch up paint pen from dealer.  Couldn’t find a big spray can of paint to match my car paint.
Wanna do my bumper bro lol fr.
Nice video. I do have a question though, where did you get the spray paint to match the color of your car? Thanks for sharing.
I scratched my car using a sponge from the gass station. It had some gravel in it. Appearantly 🤪
You are good.
Why repair the damage, if you want them repaired doo it just before selling the car and thats only if its worth the costs.
How did you blend? Is this another fake video?
Hi, how do you find the right color to match? Thanks!
Time is more valuable than Money , and we should leave something for specialists . Who r earning Bread for their Family . Good job but looks Boring to me 🙏
Excellent ! !   Thanks !
To be honest, i did find the video helpful but i found myself deeply distracted by your comedy so now I’m not concerned about my little scratches. I keep watching the video for the laughs
Sound needs tweaking….
Thanks for the good video..  I have tried this with my car... it's partially successful and it's better than I expected but I found one big problem. Even though I used the same color code spray as manual shown turned out that  colors of the body and newly sprayed part were different. I think because the body color has changed naturally defected for 5 years.... Maybe after some time, it will looks similar. I hope.
Good job mate.... great result
Dude I need ur help broo.  Same thing my wife did to the x3 right side bumper. Smh.  I need all the list of materials needed. I'm doing this in the summer.
I did a hit and run today,thats why im here and no one needs to find out
First off, you did a fantastic job! Second, you made me giggle so now you have a new subscriber! I’m sharing this with my son so he can clean up my van! Thanks!
Good video but you never sanded your blend areas and also you never put enough clear coat on, that’s why it was a Matt finish instead of gloss, also 2500 grit is too smooth to paint on
Doing this now on my front bumper. I’ll let you know how it goes..
Great job!
Good job sir.  Saving  a lot...thank you, I'll try it...
you silly:)
"I am your DADDY." "Nooooooo."       😆
look im still practicing on parking :v
Key the panel before any spraying. Scotch-brite does the trick. Helps the primer, Paint and clear coat to grip. Or suffer it peeling in weeks-months time.
I'm actually impressed and excited to try this!
Just remember that this $120 dollar repair will look exactly like a $120 repair and not a body shop $800 repair. Don't get me wrong, it is just fine. Just don't expect miracles.
Where do you buy car touch up paint in a spray can?
Nice Job!
Thank you I did something similar to my car and I'm hoping this works for my car also
why are you blurring out the brand names?  we wanna know what to buy man.  jesus
add a boy!!  well done dude. deduct $1 for not drinking the water! :)
NICE🦅👍😎🇺🇸
What a shitti job
Thx, good info.
Well why don’t you just learn how to drive
$hit looks good homie boy. Just try not to side swipe other cars or walls when pulling into and out of spots.
Fantastic!
Omg I wish you could do my vehicle!

OUTSTANDING JOB.  Wow what an inspiration for those with the dedication and talent to pull this off.  3 thumbs up!
Great video. Make sure and decontaminate with the microfiber between sanding with different grit. Don’t want no squiggles, learned that the hard way.
Terrific job.
Great overview!  Thank you!  Quick question... in the final view, it does appear that the repair paint job is slightly more matted than the rest of the car.  It seems somewhat more glossy where no repair was needed but is this just due to the lighting in the video?  Would you say with the polish and buff it is just as glossy as the rest of the vehicle?
Thanks for. The video…let save this for personal project that never gonna be use. xD
I just brushed mine out using my electric toothbrush & some toothpaste! #MintyFreshScratchRemoval
All good man.. except the volume of your audio is lower.. You should raise or optimize audio amplication - This method helps especially when soft spoken. Otherwise, Awesome sharing!
thank you
Oooo Thomas
Great job. Save money and work hard ..
This was NOT your first time, OR either you had a professional coaching you while you edited the video.  A first timer will NOT get these results.
Yep you did that.
Thomas is a fighter of Mortal Kombat against the sketches
Impressive!
Kudos on feathering and blending silver!!!! Maybe looks different sunlight, but it looks perfect there.
Can’t even tell 😀
Great job😀
that's amazing but you'd have to do it for me, I don't have that kind of patients.
Excellent 👍
What a bodge. You primed and painted onto shiny paint. You should have flatted the whole bumper corner with 800 grit paper then blend the colour out then clear coated the whole bumper corner. It wouldn't have taken much longer to do it properly. And yes, I am a vehicle painter
Dhamm amazing work 👍thank you for sharing with helpful tips💪
Very Helpful and fun to watch!
Well done.
Excellent DIY video, the comments are helpful as well. ......subscribed
Nicely done video.  Humor was good as well.  Why did you blur out the products if you have them shown in the links?
How can a metalic paint doing only the touch up ? Colour differences can be seen after the patch up. Pls explain
How did you get the car colored spray paint can? I saw you read the door sticker but that’s not a paint color code.
WOWWWW.     Thomas this is Surmang from Northern California , that was absolutely outstanding job. really appreciated your awesome video , your video helped me and saved thousands of Dollars . my Nissan Murano LE 2019 was banged soo bad last week and since my Premium was just started not even month ago there for i went to one of my friend recommended Auto body shop which that guy told me this gonna cost more then $ 2500 dollars to fix scratches and paint , because scratches was soo bad and long at driver side , i was really very upset cant understand how to fix it  , finally one of my friend told me to watch youtube about fixing all these scratches, watch dozens of youtube  but nothing much helped. ..And Finally i found your video and i was amazed , I followed all your methods and here you go  it really helped totally amazingly work done  . thank you so much Thomas  for this great work  on minimum expenses . Totally Amazing . Iam Happy and my Wife was just blown away when she saw my hard work  . My total expenses was 275 dollars and still some of the items untouched . GOD BLESS you Man .
I started driving 2 months ago and the first 2 weeks I really messed up my car lmao, did a huge mark in the back of my bumper and a scratch by the right side of the front bumper, I’ve been driving with my car looking like this for the past month and it’s time to fix it now that I’m actually decent at driving, thank you for making this!!!
Where to get all this materials?
U are a hero
i wish i had your patience
Thanks, YouTube recommended this video, somehow knowing my wife backed into another car.
this guy cant paint for shit, he never flatted and polished the clear coat and he has no idea how to apply clear coat. It will be DULL in about 8 weeks.
I keep discovering brand new scuffs on my car that I obviously haven’t done
How do you fix a scuff on the black part of the bumper if that also gets scratched? Same process?
EXCELLENT video! Thanks for getting right to the point. I learned a lot!
👏🏻👏🏻
Should use yellow auto painting tape
Wow, got the same scuff. Got a quote, $850. So got the stuff and going to try it tomorrow. Many thanks! 🙏
I thought you will surround the area for paint with tape so dont contaminate the rest of the paint?
Great job. Can I ask you how much time in total you spent on this project? Reason being I just got my car with similar scratch marks from an incident yesterday and I am not as gifted as you to do the job at one stretch, having never done this type of work on my own. Please reply if you get my request.
Great job, well done 👍
Helpful and ur humour made me LOL 😆
Note: don’t do this at home.. pay $800…
Watched this video a week ago. And now is the time! Im about to do it!!! Wish me fckin luck! Im nervous!!!!
Awesome job bro.
Good Job!💪🏼
So helpful, thank you! I have a few cars to use these tools and methods upon. You make it look doable and your car looks fantastic!
Looks good
Had the same scratches and they asked me 1200
Thank you for the video.We have a brick mailbox and while I was getting the mail I cut the corner too sharp. The rear door is completely scratched so yk…
Super!!!👍👍👍👍👍
Very very good work !!!!!
The sandable paint online has only 3 options. My car is a gold color. The options are grey, white or red. Should I get the grey or should I find a different company?
Amazing 👏 🙀 😯 😮
Great video, got hit by some idiot, and came out to a scratched Jeep in the am smh. Anyway awesome video ! Should do the job
I just cratched tf out of my car so hopefully this works or imma go dig a grave for myself
For that sandable primer isn’t it different colors ? If so any specific one or doesn’t matter since it’s getting painted & sanded  anyway , & basecoat color is just the color of the car correct ?
Great job man!
Great Job!
I liked it..great humor
… me watching this after i hit my bfs car in literally the exact color cherokee in this video 😞
AWESOME!!
Can u do it on the whole car
Thank you very much I really appreciate I'm sick and tired of the crooked machanics
That's very handy our car need that and have a dent
Coming home from the gym my arms were weak and I didn’t turn correctly. Scraped my car on the concrete fence of my house 🤦‍♂️
Which primer do you use?
Would you do the same process for scratches on a metal panel?
Scratched my car up and broke the door handle😭. On top of that, it has a dent in it from me trying to park in the yard. The snow didn’t make it no better
I just scratched my car today like the people liked this comment.
Hi, If my car is black, what primer color do I need to use?  I only find in red, gray and white
That thing looks clean. Very professional job. I would have 100 grit sanded, base coat then bondo on grooves and then more base and she's good to go. All under an hour. But that's just me.
1:40 is what had me ⭐️
It's funny at the same time. Thanks!
Very good. Also a very good idea to sand everywhere you are going to paint, also use wax and grease remover before paint. To get a high gloss finish use 2k clear you can get it in a spray can..
Do you use any solvents to clean surfaces?
It's 100 percent mechanic / painter exercise, a lay man is not benefited by this Robbish video
Wow!
An instructional video.... THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE !!!  Absolutely exceptional video my brother... I am quite stoked that I ran into it.. so clear and concise ! And it seems as though a lot of your commenters through in some excellent tips as well... You have made my day !!!
Hi Thomas. Just subscribed. Just want to ask if this is applicable to plastic front bumpers? Thanks.
One of the best instructional videos I have ever seen. Great job.
Totally worked. Thank you for posting this.
Can’t wait to see my baby looking clean again
amazing job.
Lol. My friend’s car was parked in Brooklyn. Today morning he saw his new Volkswagen Atlas completely scratched the entire side. Plus a small dent looking like someone instead of driving away, hit deeper the front.
AWESOME job, man!!!  Thanks for the video...it helps me with a VERY similar situation on my vehicle.  Well Done!
Where do you get the paint and do you have any product and brand recommendations? I’m gonna do this and hopefully save over 1500$
My dumbass is here after trying to leave a parking spot and forgetting there’s a curve in front of me and mounting it. Scratched the whole front bumper 😂
Great job.
Impressive
I actually tried this myself, this was an awesome process and I fixed my car completely. My Front Bumper looks like it is brand new. Some tips and pointers that I can give to anyone else watching this is make sure you don’t spray too close or too slow. We’re all beginners, we will make mistakes and that’s okay. Just be prepared to do a lot more buffing if you make blobs of paint or primer. Try to use lower grit sandpaper to fix your errors and gradually smooth out w/ 1500 grit and 2500 grit. Also when you mix the body filler. Put a small amount of hardening in the mix. Your mix should be gray colored and not pink. If it is pink, it’ll harden fast and get chunky, you may need to buff it down and try again. Also TAPE EVERYTHING, the spray paint works very well in the way it costs and reached places, I didn’t think it would. Hope you can learn from my mistakes. Enjoy! Excellent video!!!
You did a great job!
Very informed video, straight to the point. Your hard work turned out great. Nice job!!!
What is a good store to order aerosol or paint pens ? Searched a few like touch up direct and micro finish , they have poor reviews. Any suggestions?
I hope people realise that doing this yourself will not be as easy as it looks 😄 and the panel you repair yourself will 100% be noticeable when you try to resell your car and will cause the car to lose value.  Also light scratches can be removed with T cut or similar products.
Hi , Thomas . I need your help to paint my car.   can I have your email please
Omg, you did a great job, but id be too scared too do that on my own car. What if i messed it up And made it worse? Lol my scratches look just like the ones you had but on the passenger side. Great video!
Thanks Thomas for this informative video. Will be trying this on my similarly scratched 2011 Infiniti G37XS Coupe front bumper.
This video made me realize that I should let a professional handle this and just pay them what they ask
Can you come do mine please
Can I use this method to fix the scratches part of the forklift?
Could youbdo mines
Fuck to much work bro I will rather pay someone to do this work
Can you use this method on metal body parts like the door and bonnet
Excellent video, thanks.
Excellent video...    now go and do your car...
Thank you for the awesome video! I think it is the best that I found on Youtube!!! May I know what sandable primer you are using? Can you kindly provide a link? It seems to be missing in the video description.:-)
Hi! Is the paint comes with the base coat and clear coat?
Excellent results! I'm curious to know how the color holds up over time. Thanks for sharing. I find body shop prices are getting more and more ridiculous.
made me smile, thank you solid video
Not the bad drivers hang out here, we were all bumped by bad drivers ☝🏻😄
You did an amazing job 👏
Well done 👏🏽 thanks
Spray can primer is junk, spray can color coat is bigger junk ( it would NEVER match ) Spray can clear is big time JUNK!  It will dry but never get hard.  Anything looks good in a video.
awesome job cheers for sharing
My car had bad deep scratches wow is this in Australia 🇦🇺?
Repent and turn to Jesus Christ before it’s too late
I loved this video amazing
Have you done this before? Be honest.
That was awesome.
Before going to all this work, try just using cutting/repair polish first.  You may find that you will remove all or most of the scratches.  If you still have a few scratches they may be small enough to leave.  If, on the other hand you have gouges like Grand Canyon and you have to follow this blokes instructions, YOU MUST wash the area with Prepsol or other solvent that will remove the silicon in the polish.  It is not really necessary but any silicon left could screw up all you hard work.
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅👏🏼👍🏼
i would just pay a bodyshop and have it done right. i don't have the patience to fool around with body work.
Now you know why they charge so much. This is not as easy as 1-2-3, it takes a lot of work, and if it isn't perfect, they won't get paid.
I want to know what happened to the 1 glass of water
Great video by an amateur for amateurs. I will do this for myself!
Love your cute sense of humor!!!...But I have to stay....thats is SOOOO amazing!!! You have a gift of patience and artistry!!! Great work thanks for sharing.  I need that done on front bumper of my car...wish we were neighbors!!!😄😅😂😂thanks again!!
Why no clear coat?
Great video, great work on the repair. I am inspired that I might try repairing my rear bumper my self.
It looks good  but did you apply clear coat. Doesn't look shiny like the rest
Great job and thanks for sharing! But when I watched all those steps, and then looked at my unexperienced hands, I decided to go for the 800 dollars solution 🤔
They say you can't believe everything you see on the internet
Great vid, thank you
You did better than the body shops I would pay you the 800 dollars 😆
Now go back and run your hand over the rest of the car that you didn’t mask off. You will feel the molecular overspray as small bumps. If that bothers you you might have to clay bar the whole car 🤔🤔🤔
Superb video, your step by step narration, camera work and supply list of products needed made this a comprehensive video on repairing scratches. Adding the recommended wait time between coatings was also appreciated. Good lighthearted humor, I’m now a subscriber.
Good luck with that method..there is a lot more to it than that..lve been painting fifty years from the seventies to 2005..trust me it is not that straight forward..😂😂😂😂😂🥳
Beautiful done and great instruction! Easy to follow and great humour 🤘😝
Great video 👍
Very nice! 👍
WOW.... GREAT JOB!!
Well done you did an excellent job.
Excellent video and the explanation in the notes are spot on.
2 much work
🤣🤣🤣🤣 glass of water!
Is your paint is metallic? One of the few things I know about metallic paint is that it's very much harder to match because it's so sensitive to technique, spray distance from the surface, humidity, etc'.
I’m crying because you didn’t sand all the areas u applied primer to all the areas that were painted before scuffing up the original clear-coat will chip from rock on road
I have a similar scratch on my Pontiac Vibe and the estimate was $200...maybe shop around?
Amazing better than auto videos!!!
Great job, thank you.
it will cost 10-20$ at a garage in india :-)
Entertaining vid! Thanks
Jesus dude I’m way to high to bother with all that, I thought you was gonna use something simple
👎👎👎👎----------------> 👎👎👎👎 👎
EXCELLENT Video!😁 Thank You!🙂
Rofl glad you clarified the water lol
The reconditioning of you car is great but all that noise and face stuff needs to stop. Duhhhhhhhhh or whatever you're doing. Very immature.
This was lowky funny though hahaah
Amazing and patient only problem for my car is 2004 so colour matching is a problem.
I just had a car bumper scrape yesterday. The car, however, is just a rental and am not trying to pay a fortune with the rental or my insurance so hopefully I can make this work.
Can still see paint difference under headlight…
thinking of trying this on my mercedes c300... got all the supplies just really dont want to destroy my cars paint by not getting it done professionally 😂 might just send it though, nice video
Seems like some  people say regular bondo should not be used for plastic bumpers. Bondo and other make a plastic filler.
you didn’t need to paint the whole fender 🧐
Great video! So now I have a really dumb question - where do you buy the paint that matches your car color?
Nice video well done!
Great upload friend. thank you for share!
111111111111111111111
Thanks! You did an amazing job on this.  Is it necessary to use a primer underneath regardless of the color of your car? (mine is white)
The water LOOOL🤣🤣🤣
I did it and the result was amazing, greetings from: Zacatecas México and Oklahoma City. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Good job
You can also not be obsessed with your car and leave the scratches. Save hundreds of dollars.
I think mine is beyond this but might try it
How long did that take you to fix? It looks fantastic
I have a Primer but its not a "Sandable" label can't it still be sand down?
Maybe it would help if you would tell us what # compound and wax you used that might be little helpful,  thanks
Good video. Why blue tape, not other colours?
the glass of water is a real good deal!
Work it looks amazing nice job
Nice job !
That's$800 and $120 different. You know why?  What's the problem of your project.  - scratches will show up after 2 weeks under the sun.  - paint off when you use power washer to shoot it - clear coat not shine after few months  *Filler never put on top the paint *Don't use over 1000G wet sand paper before to paint , the paint will not stick on. But you can do some more work on clear coat, 1500G to 3000G wet sand on the clear coat then spray clear coat again   From your scratches damage, I suggest a easy way for you.  - use a sander or a pad/ wood etc, not fingers!!! 😤😤😤 -120G/150G dry sand paper to sand down all the scratches area, 220G sand smooth 120/150,  320 sand smooth 220 and the primer area. (Use high build primer) -400G dry sand then 600G wet sand at the primer area , 1000G wet sand the primer and larger area ready for paint.   From your damage, no need to put body filler on it. Beside the plastic bumper better be plastic finished. or use plastic filler at the very worse area that can not be plastic finished.   Hope this suggestion can improve your experience. 🥳🥳🥳
After the video, he cleaned his camera lens, with                        A Cleeean Micro Fiber Towel
Nice car, I liked it. Well it's hard work involved in it. Firstly to do the painting and next to do the video. Good job!
THANKS SIR... I NEEDED THIS....My neighbor (who is a complete loser), keyed my car with 2 very long and deep scratches on my SUV.  I'm going to restore my drivers do and have my car looking like new...THANKS TO YOU!
Need like 10 microfiber towels for the whole process..😂
Makes me want to go out and scratch my car just so I can try this out.
Audio?
Soo funny and helpful. Thks.
Now I see why it costs a few hundred bucks... I will let the expert do the job, with guarantee.
Nice video. Where can you get the paint in a spray can specific to your car?
Thank you!!!!!💖
Im here after my Dumba** Neighbor Pulled out they driveway Rear ended my TRUCK and took off .. Sadly No Cameras and Wich neighbor out of 40+ apartment Doors ? FREAKING AYY MAN ...
Excellent job. Thanks a lot
Looks amazing 👏
I'm impressed!!
Hey i just scraped the door of my mums car coming in the driveway its so narrow 😭 shes away for 3 more days and I needa fix it before she gets back. Would I be able to use the same method you used in this but for the lower car door.
Absolutely amazing work. I'm amazed that you were able to get the paint to blend perfectly with the rest of the bumper.
what is a pass?  Do you mean you did this 5 times (pass)?  THanks
Good job!
Well done.  Got my one with same spot scratches. Gone they will be, thanks to you!
Fantastic job!
Not bad 👍🏽
Awsome
cheers mate, guide helped a lot
This video was excellent I just learned something that could really save me thousands thanks a bunch you rock 🤟🤘✌️🙌👍
Going to try my job tomorrow thanks buddy 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Im here after scratching my moms car🤣🤣🤣
I came here after I crashed my husband’s car😂😂
Very nice 👍 job
Looks good 👍
which clear coat did you use?
STOP DOUBTING YOURSELF!!! And just do it
You did a beautiful job!
Well done great repair
First time in my life, where I didn't blink for 6 minutes and 22 seconds. I was stuck. 😆 Great job!
You have no idea what your doing 😂
Easy fo you to say . . .!
Perfect. Thank you through talking through the steps with what you used and how you used it. You inspired me to take care of my own scratches on my car...
3:09 BEST PART 🤣
Wait what, you sprayed over 2500 grit????? 1000 grit is the max
Thank you for this❤️
what a video, you deserve millions of subscribers. My car has the same damage like yours, just came from the shop, they estimated $1,465 for painting a small separate piece.
You could just pretend they’re not there ! Save yourself ££££££££’sssss.
Great job, dude. Very impressive.
Here after hit and run :) thanks!
There is no way we amateurs can do this. This is really to display his skill,
Good job
Where did you get the correct base coat ?
This video is one of the best and funniest diy videos I have watched!  I have the bondo and primer done, will be starting the base and clear coat tomorrow, so far so good, it was way easier than I expected so far, just had to sand the crap out of the rust in the scratch!  Everything has turned out smooth so far!
Which primer should I get for a car that’s a more icey silver instead of grey. The white or grey?
What clear coat did u used?
Excellent 👍
I love this video! Thank you for this..Cant wait to try it!!!
Thank you very much for this vid, I now have a battle plan for restoring my impala, the first week I got it I parked in my tiny parking spot and just heard that unsettling noise, lol I rubbed up against the pole of my apartments so now I'm glad I'll be able to repair it on my own and I won't have to driver around with that embarrassing mark lol
You didn't include the cost of the mask you used to paint your car!  Anyhow, thanks for your video.
Do we treat this differently if there's surface rust?
Would you do this on the hood or larger flat area without doing the entire panel? Smaller , less eye catching areas with contours seem like you won't notice as much that its been repaired.
Can you polish my car!
Right on brother!
thank you bud
Lol I got a scratch on my 2014 jeep Cherokee!!
I've got scratch on my car , I didn't do it the wife did ....... Honest.
Not a novice !  lol.😂
shake well the can otherwise it wont be the same color as your car. and test it on a paper before that was my mistake and do not spray alot just go fast left to right
Soooooo good
I scratched my Nissan SV and im so sad🤣
I literally scratched my mom's car 🤦‍♂️
Thank you for the great video and the valuable info ! May I ask you where can I get the sandable primer,basecoat color and gloss clear coat please ? Also is still working well with u after 3 years ? Thank you very much
but he skipped the clear coat tho. LOL!
Brilliant video mate gave me the confidence to do the car I bought my lad that had a few scratches here and there.
No f#@@ way!!!
Thank you so much!!!
Thank you for this. I went nuts when I fucked it up but I redid it and it looks good. Thank you!
Waooo! Very educating,  thanks for sh,aring.
Getting a used car soon with some scratches exactly like this one, for sure gonna use this video to help me fix it, super clean!
Nice job!  Thanks for sharing
That was not properly blended and you can see there's a mismatch
Last year I had to do get my car repaired for deep scratches and the paint that was used didn’t match with the rest of the car. Do I just need to buy the base cost/clear coat? Thanks
Kindly list things to use  again
Great job brother 👍🏽
My car scratch I want to remove. mail me details so I can buy material.
How do you know what color/shade to get in the spray? That’s where I’m stuck at
Just fixed mine up :) can I hand wash the car the next day though? It was a small area but I don’t want to damage the fresh paint/clear coat
Thomas. This was by far the best step by step video ever made on painting! Thank you!
4 million+ views means there are 4 million+ people who scratched their cars and want to know how to fix it
napierdolił 3 kg szpachli i zadowolony
Do you have to repaint the whole bumper? Or can you just do the scratched area?
Wow u did a good job bro.
Looks like I've joined the club 🤦‍♂️😂 Great video! Very detailed and explained! Do you use the gloss clear paint in the video? I watched it over and over.. 🤔😅
My car got keyed by some piece of shit...
You the man
100 dollar's i have exactly the same scratches i did it with shine armour less than 20 dollar
This is way above my pay grade. It’s amazing but no way can I reproduce those results.
Where do u get the spray paint like psc
What about dents where that scratch paint is ?
How the hell did yt knew that I scratched my car and suggested this?  😅😅😅
Lol, just found where all the woman hangout.
I’m just curious what’s a good recommendation for how many passes you should do for primer, paint, and clear coat?
How tf u know how to do this u weirdo
Thanks for the video, if you have clear coat (gloss) residue in the form of droplets, what can I do to remove them ?
What I learned,  Spray clear coat light, but with many pass to avoid paint run.
Thank you so much for teaching us the way 🥺
woow, that was a great job.
Go to any body shop and take a look at every one who works there.  Then, decide if you appear smarter than any of them.  You’re welcome.
Very helpful, thanks.
I have the same scratch on my car on the same sight
Class!
Great tips for beginners, great beginning, but a very poor ending. Very incomplete instructional video. I followed your instructions from beginning to end. You never addressed the clear coat, sanding the clear coat if applied thicker (having in mind newbies are watching your videos). Maybe you have the touch, but 99% of newbs don't...
Who else is here because they are an idiot magnet and people keep scratching their car
Wow that was informative, helpful, and mildly funny 😄
Great work.  I’m gonna try it this weekend. Some Ash Soul keyed my baby. Hahahahahahaha.
my lil sister effed my car up by smashing a golf cart into it at the cotty soooo imma pray this works lol 😭😭😭
great  video! any problems to spray primer and then base coat directly the clear coat, surrounding the damaged area? Any potential issues to expect?
Fantastic job
Damn, you are gorgeous!  Your lips are the best!
Great job!
Good job man!
Thomas, that's a nice result and you get to keep some beer money to celebrate !
How to choose the right the color or where to take it? For a BMW
Such an amazing video. I love to watch all your video. They are super amazing and informative at the same time. Keep posting more!
You saved my life!!!
Well done - super job!
Sweet.
Yea needing to fix my bumber .
Dude you made it look so easy, thanks. If I fail to get a good result, I know where to find you (youtube) 🙂 cheers!
Good job done. 👍🏻. Could you pls tell me, what was the labour charge. 😀. You have mentioned about the 120 dollars material cost. What about the labour charge, ofcourse, you have done it yourself. 😀👍🏻.
Hey Thomas great job I try to do my car 2...god bless you bro...and your family...thank you ..but I don't know the materials list can you tell me the list what I need please..👍👍👍👷‍♂️🥉🥉
Good video dude, easy on the jokes
I’m back two months later to try myself. I decided to gain the skills and save that $700 to pay these bills :) I’m make a video inspired by you. Keep a look out for it or I’ll come back and let you know. Thanks!
maybe wet the towels before. It's always a bad idea to use a dry towel
Someone in my apartment complex scratched my car🥺 they still haven’t come clean but this helps
This video seem a lot helpful
I just scratch my 2014 Chrysler 300 for the first 😭😭😭 worst feeling ever
Looks good!
good job!
Where you get paint from?
W O W
The tranquil thunderstorm osmotically excuse because female fortunately order circa a teeny vest. tame, loutish news
It costs $300 to get a bumper painted where I’m at. Not worth all the hassle to save $180. Looks like a lot of work.
I scratched my car yesterday and my dad would die if he knew hahah thanks for the help!!💕💕🚗
How do you find matching spread paint?!
Awesome work! Bumper looked brand new. Appreciate you for sharing your auto paint techniques👌🏽
well done.
Funny
what color sandable primer are you using? Is it gray?
Bad ass dude is funny
...
How much it cost?
I’m here after I scrapped my car exiting my garage, thank you Thomas!😩😅
Idiot.. before you sanded you should cover the surrounding plastic trim.
I will pay you 200 to do mine
Dude you are the man...im impressed...I bet if I did it I would of totally f$%ked it up...
Great video bruh
Where did you get your paints? So many options.
Seriously the best “how to video” on this subject I’ve seen yet!!  I scratched the hood of my sons car putting a small tool box on top of it.. (The tool box had been in the house I didn’t think there was anything on the bottom to scratch the car) needless to say.. my son wasn’t very happy with me.. now I need to fix it.. with the help of this video.. I got this in the bag! 😅
Ridiculous 😂😂😂 unprofessional amateur
Excellent job
Someone scrapped my car last night in the parking lot. Gonna try this out. Time to get a dashcam too.
Lol definitely enjoyed the "I am your daddy" ahahahaa. On the real; I don't understand the thumbs down you received. Thanks for the tips and for providing as much detail as possible.
where can i get the gloss clear coat and  sandable primer
Can I do this without sandpaper primer and just go straight to painting because I did that?
I had to watch this a DOZEN times!!!! it took me 3 hours to get the point & learn how to do this repair!!! Because it started out serious & then it became seriously FUNNY & i couldnt stop laughing LOL
thanks .... i will try this on my bumper which is scratched too.. was wondering so u had primer  , base coat and clear coat
How can I get some colour of paint that are not natural
The glass of water part took me out😂😂
I crash into a pole ...backing up ...am so mad 😡
Great job on the video! Short and to the point. Definitely going to try it!
ive got my car scratch and im scraching my head ..dammit
Fffffffffffffeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnntttttttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaasssssstttttttttiiiiiiqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq   Jack ........!!!!
You talk too much bro but good video
Can I use this on two wheeler.??
Thank you. After searching forever finally found this video. Exactly what I was looking for. List of everything you used  And the process quickly done. Awesome!
To be honest, most people would rather spend the money to repair the scratches, because that's is just too much work just saying.
Amazing!!! Don’t think I can do it though… 😂
Wow, that was beautiful!
I'm here after I scratched my new Honda civic hybrid.You're awesome man. I don't know if I can be awesome like you. If I was awesome I'd be able to do same thing on my car 😢
Still thinking of buying my first car but was brought to this video!!! 😂😂😂
You’re amazing. Ever since I learned to change my own tires and replace my air filter I had never felt this powerful
Excellent!! You did it and made a video too..truly commendable 😀
EXCELLENT! !
bad job
Are you in la
Like a boss 👍
సూపర్ 👌👌
Great video thank you
Haha I like the way this guy does his videos! Always as me laughing 🤣
I wish he is my neighbor to guide me through this personally
Good work.  Nothing like trying to help your self.
Will it work if I have a little dent right there?
Thank you ?  🌺👏🌺
Can you explain what “ each coat covering more and more area “ mean ? Is it to blend ? Does it mean you went over the area you did not sand ?
I'm having a hard time making my car shine. I'll do some wet-sanding on the sandable primer, then I would spray approximately 9-10 inches away from the car the 3 light coats in 5 minute intervals. After waiting 30 minutes, I add a clear coat 3 times with up to 15 minute intervals between each coat. I wait overnight, then I wash it, put compound on, then I put polish on. The test-card I used to make sure the paint is the right color even shows the paintcan itself is fine... but my supposedly metallic paint comes out really matte and dark... I'm at a loss. Has anyone resolved this issue?
woah 4.1m views wow
@thomasofalltrades so you can get the same color of your car in a spray can?
I don’t think I got the skill for this 😢
Nice job taking matters to your own hands. Keep going
Thank you for the education. I'm in the same situation
I also needed a glass of water because I was thirsty. (2 MINUTES LATER) Remember the water from earlier? I didn't drink it, I used it on the sandpaper, lol 😆 😂 Great video btw 👌
Does the "hardener" come with the Body Filler? Or is that bought separately?
Thanks for the helpful video bro.
You did a wonderful job but you need some rims to is a rims to make it pop
Just to be clear, this was plastic bumper right?
Homie sound like he has a fat tongue no homo
Good job !
Literally got my license today and scratched it
Where did you get all your materials??
Yup  My brand new truck 2021 tundra Only 2 months and guess what ......yup , the wife did a36 inch scratch on it . Thats bs .
Its so easy
I scratch my car
Can you tell me where you got that crucial glass of water from please? Can you recommend also how you applied it to your mouth and stomach? Thanks
Hello mate I’m really appreciate you for what you have done it but I need to ask you what’s BASECOAT COLOR AND SANDABLE PRIMER?
Awesome
Nice dab
Nice job man! Subs 🤗
Thanks for this video my guy! Need to do some work on my car! Your deff getting a sub
Entertaining, funny and rewarding!! Thanks for sharing! You’re saving us so serious money!
This guy is good!!!
Looks really good
Looks nice
we have to swipe our IDs to get into our parking lot at work and i pulled up too close to the wall so here i am 🥲
wooooowwww! great vid bro! imma invest another 30 bucks for pizza and beer for help with the compound and wax labor from nephews 😂
Ima need to save this
I like his intro; "I recently got a scratch...".  It's more like, you recently hit something.  Anyway, the repair turned out great!
Do you want to do mines because am over here stress about the scratches on my new car😅
Thanks for the video, Thomas! Great step-by-step guidance. If I am painting a part of the car, how do I bend the paint so that it is less noticeable compared to the rest of the paint?
Funny thing happened to me. I hit the play button to watch this video and I didn’t know that it was first playing a advertisement and used the method I saw on the add and it worked. After getting the product I again hit the video and realized that I had not seen your video but only the add. Since I had the product from the add I tried it that way and it worked. I’m sure the method you provided would work but the other was cheaper and worked out okay. Haha that never happened to me before
Nice Work!!!
does this work on plastic bumpers? I have a Subrua Impreza. Also can you use a pen instead of spray?
You did such a good job thanks for showing the steps...I wont forget to have some ice water nearby, and dabb when I'm done 😂
Guys keep in mind it’s not as easy as it looks. If your a beginner and depending on how much damage, it could require a big time commitment & patience to do it right. Especially if you don’t have an extra car to drive while your working on the damaged 1. I learned the hard way. So If you don’t have the time or patience, & skill level for this, just take it to a professional & get it over with.
Brilliant, detailed, informative video. Needed something like this after the car scraped a gatepost. Not quite so easy as the guy shows, but I had never attempted anything like this before. The outcome was fantastic, if I say so myself, although the colour match was a little off, which is, apparently, to be expected when trying to spray an old car. Thank you Thomas.
Wish I wasn’t here watching this video 😭🥺
Where do you get spray can that has your matching paint
I just got amy first car today and my mom scraped the bumper down to the fiberglass so i think this will help thanks
What about the clear coat bro
I wonder how much the glass of water cost 🤔?
Dab some compound
LOL I subscribed after the dab  :D
I dropped my bike as I was putting on the  kick stand. And scratched the front fender on a rock. Thanks for the video
My dad's makin me fix a mark I didn't even do😭
Neat thanks
Thanks for sharing. This is confirmation that the auto body shops are a complete ripoff. If you go to them with a scratch exactly like yours they tell you that they must paint the entire bumper . Yet yours looks perfect even though you did that one spot.
I forgot to sand the primer before the base coat. I painted the 1st base coat and now lost. Can I sand now lol
Wiped the dust with a dry cloth? Lol
great video, where to buy all these sandpapers ,paint related stuff? I have Honda Civic and CRV which has quite scratches, like to fix by myself
I’m going to try this this weekend for a bumper scratch on my Chevy Cruze
Amazing job!   You inspired me to try it on my car!
Just practice on the scratches on your wife's car. When you get good at it, do yer own. If you screw up, she'll kick yer ass and you'll have two cars fkd up.
That was bad ass!!! Hella clean meng~ Thanks bro that gave me the confidence I needed, Great detailed explaining Thomas you're SIKWITIT
Very informative ,thank you.
Please never take this video down
Shit y’all cryin bout a scratch a nigga broke my door off my Infiniti  🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
loved the vid man
some douche hit the rear bumper of my car and ran away yesterday.. Now I'm here
Thank you very much for this information i did this with my car an it worked out great. 👍
https://youtu.be/JT6oycR_25w
I thought he still had a scratch on the car. Turns out the scratch is on my phone. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Scratched my car pretty bad yesterday and it suffers from neighborhood kids scratching it while walking so this is very helpful! I just need the materials and time and I'll be good to go! Thank you for the inspiration! 😊
I was hoping you would have done a head on shot comparing the right side you repaired and the left side, which i assume, was not damaged!?!?!
Hello thanks so much for this helpful video! I'm on the linked website for the car paint and they list "aerosol spray paint" and "ready to spray pint can" as two different purchase item options. What's the difference between the two and which did you use for your repair?
Bondo is not made for plastic bumper and panels.. you can do get away with it but it's barely there a palm bang a plastic bumper you will see the Bondo crack like dry clay.  You need a body filler made for plastic otherwise same technique
And them the color look nothing the same kkkkkk👎🏿
I am so impressed! Thank you for sharing!
Man how much Maco charge lol
the thumbnail looked like it was a beach
Awesome!! Thanks for sharing.
Video was liked good job Braun
Is it just me or is the clear coat not the same as oem !?
You did a damn good job. I bought the materials to fixed the scratch on my new Camry but I am still too chicken to repair it myself. Some bitch keyed my shit out of Jealousy. I think I might just take it to maaco.
Is it safe to put compound after clear coat? How long should you wait to polish with compound?
Excellent ‘how to’ guide - very well explained, structured and shot
i really wanted him to drink that cup of water. what a waste.
Very good Daniel-san. Now we learn to squish grape with chopstick.
Did you paint the whole bumper cover?
You did an awesome job, you do not recognize where there was a scratch,  it looks like new,👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍
.
I found something that works better it’s a easy puller device this is the link https://real-wheel.com/mini-car-dent-repair-suction-cup/
i have scrapes and scratches from parking lot idiots.  found repair system with all the items to fix it.  how much does the paint cover.  why is the body repair kit and bumper repair kit different
Too much work.
I am your daddy!
Dude you did a really good job.👍
Great job  , great video. Cheers
You got me with the glass of water!!!!! Lol That's funny 🤣
cool video now i’m going to get a whole bunch of amazon youtube adds across my screen it’s usually what happens on our diy projects. thanks man you should do this on the side.
Why r u hiding the brands?
Awesome job.
Woow you are so good
So like is this as easy to do as the video? Lol
😂
Thank you very much.  Love the humor hehe. Now I can fix my car scratches and get buffed!
I nearly had it at one stage Dougal.
This is a life saver. Thank you.
Excellent excellent video..  not a bunch of unnecessary commentary, great skipping and speed through of mundane repetitive footage and a touch of humor that was actually funny.  GREAT JOB!
700? What are you charging me 600 dollars for? Sir, I said 800. Noooooo lmao too funny
That was very helpful video.  Thank you.
Thank you so much for this! Awesome! I’m going try this on my car that someone hit :)
exactly my same prob thnx, gunna try this week
A guy reversed into my car today and caused a few scratches, I told him it was fine and just let it go so I'm going to use this video to fix it myself. Thanks dude
That’s how you do a YouTube video. Helpful, Simple and to the point. With some Light joking. VERY We’ll done sir.
Can i just buy the paint and not do the rest 😂 will it last long on the car?
Buffed
Can you please share the brand of sand-able primer you used?
Question: why didn’t you opt in to use the clear coat to protect the base? Phenomenal job and tutorial nonetheless! 👏
I’m stuck between paying $700 and doing it myself for the $100🤔
Thank you!!!
I've been thinking about doing this to my car for the last month now and your video pops up today...lol I have similar scuff marks on my back bumper that took off paint but didn't dig into the plastic which will make the job much easier for me. Your video has given me confidence to do the job ! Thank you for posting ! Very informative and entertaining too !
Hey Thomas, where did you find the car paint in a spray can? And the clear coat?
Am I able to do it outdoors instead of indoors?
Inspiring...i also want do it muself ...
Love this Video. Straight to the point with humor. Easy to follow
bro, i have a bmw 4 series g22 and i got a scratch on the bottom of the bumper and it was the size of my finger just by hitting the curb doing a u turn and I went to bmw and they got it fixed for $9000, no scam, wish i saw this video before I got it fixed.
Yeah, can I come and have you fix mine?
How many anxious people on this video who haven’t even scratched their car?
Great video. You have some skill.
Wow good job...👍
U did that!
I hit my moms car smh
Great - very clear, thank you! 🙂
How do I go about fixing very tiny scratches? I have a lot on my car
THANK YOU, you are a life saver!!
Bravo!
05:03  Dabbin' It
Good job fr ..going to attempt to do mine
Awesome job👍
Watching this makes me cringe. *this is a cheap fix, not a "good as new" fix that you'd get from a professional body shop*
Stupid question but: is the gloss clear coat and the primer any or does it have to be color specific? Do they come in color or no?
Impressive
I was so surprised when it turned out the headlight wasn't the only one on that side 😂 😂
Sir you made it look so easy actually it really is he did an awesome job and you know what no one's ever too old to learn something new thank you very much I enjoyed it it was plain and simple you put it in layman's terms thank you
I'm here cause my neighbor scratched my baby in the parking lot. I started calling her Tina Belcher😂😂😂😂😂
Terrific 👍, I will try but not sure it would come out this good. Thanx for sharing.
I cam here for the instructions and stayed for the acting.
Made a nice job of that dude well done 👍
Damn. I'm def gonna try this on my car. Got a new car and now it's all scratched from as ass hole at a parking lot. From now on, I'm gonna be parking in the far back.
Here because I hit a badger this morning (guilty for the unfortunate accident)
Nicely done!
Wow! Amazing! Thanks for posting 😀
There some steps that you forgot and another one's that you did unnecessary. The first steps are ok but, the bondo you need to press into the scratches and remove the excess with the spreader at 45º flexing it with your fingers to copy the shape of the bumper in this case. With this technique you will save sand time, a better adherence of the bondo to the piece, excess of bondo and avoid the use of a hard grade sandpaper to level it, you can sand it with 150 and you have to control with your fingers that there are no steps between the sanded bondo and the piece. Once you achive that you have to sand with a 220, 320, and finally with a 400 all the piece that will receive paint, if you don't kill the brigte and paint over it the paint won't stick and will begin to peel soon. Once you do that you can apply the primer coats, once it dry you have to sand it with a 600 and finally with 800 WET Sandpaper, clean all the surface (with a degreaser) let it dry and apply the base coats and the clear coats, always trying to blend the new base coat with the old and the same for the clear coat. If you use a 1K clear coat you have to wait a week to polish, if you use a 2k one day or two if you live in a cold or wet weather area. Before polish you have to level the clear coat pore, the famous "orange peel" and level the old with the new, to do that use a wet 1500 sandpaper, then a 2000, 2500, 3000 and finally a 5000 if you gonna polish by hand. And now you can use the compound and finish by hand to make it bright. Follow those steps and you will get a better, no peal and smoother finish.
To anyone thinking of following the instruction in this video... don't. This guy doesn't have a clue what he is talking about.
Thank You Thomas.  I was not well a month ago, just came back from hernia surgery.  I did not pull my car in far enough before I closed the garage door.  The door reversed and I new I scratched my bumper.  Well, your video is excellent.  If I screw it up, I am only out $100!  Now the real question is who are the 2200 viewers that gave you a thumbs down?
Well done
Wow!!
that small edit video in the beginning where the dealer said “$800 sir” was too funny 😂
Good job done. Thanks for sharing the  experience.
Hi Thomas I live in Australia. Automotivetouchup does not have delivery facility to Australia. Can anyone suggest me where to get right paint in Australia?
Om which distance i need to hold the spray? Is sparying difficult?
Great video with everything I needed to know, thank you!!
Thank you, but why do you have to cover the name on the product you are using?
Someone scratched my car 😞
I've bought a scracthed up car..
Wow that is so cool!!!
This video wasn’t only helpful it was hilarious and put me in a better mood 😇
PERFECT !!!
Who hasn't damaged a car but instead parked properly and still gets f****d by people damaging and disappearing shame on you bad drivers yano who you are ✌️👀😑
On my way to fuck up my integra 😅
After watching this, I decided to pay the 1,000 dollars.
My touch up paint always seem to look darker. Very frustrating since I’m following instructions!  Lol. But the video definitely helps
I just backed up into a pole so fast but managed to break just in time to get no dents, I just got some scratches and marks ( I accidentally pressed the gas instead of the break when I backed up) Hate my life
This is too much, I can't do it! Panel Beater wer ar u
Impressive and humorous
🤢🤌🏼🖕🖕
can you do my car next sir 🤪
thank you..what about a clearcoat? did you find you didn't need it? thank you i subbed and liked your vid..
I’m here after I scratch my truck 😅 thanks. I dunno if I can do it😅 thank you
no lies man,that's about normal..with the amount of work you did,is 800 that much more?
I have a scratch like this on my rear end.  1) wet and clean with soap. 2) lightly sand with washcloth.  3) apply two layers of betadine solution. Allow 3 minutes between each application.  4) using a putty knife, apply small layers of Boudreaux's Butt Paste, let dry for 30 minutes. 5) lightly sand with 10,000 grit Emery cloth, using fresh clean sparkletts water. 6) wipe again with extremely soft never before used lambswool, preferably from 6 month old. 7) collect and use your own ear wax on the location to prevent insane feeling of itching. 8) blow a light coating of baby powder.  9) prevent future scratches on your rear end by using soft terry cloth, use light coating of ear wax combined with 5.307853 drops of cortisone.  Rub softly but vigorously, easy but hard, keep it simple but be very detailed.  Best wishes for this perfect solution to repairing scratches on your rear end, everyone will thank you for it!
Those were not scratched they were gouges and scrapes. Best left to a proper body shop.
I got into an accident last month and the body shop was charging 2k to get it all fixed, saw your video and ordered everything, gonna start Friday! Not gonna lie I love your video and explanation the best!
Guys I just ran into my garage. 😂 I'll deny it to anyone else to my grave, but with my YouTube fam Imma fess up.
Wow, that's too advanced for me, and I'm usually adventurous...😓
How much do the custom mixed cans of paint and clear cost? Thanks for the informative video.
Got a scratch on the back of my car from a guy bumping into me at a stop sign and then just got a bigger scratch on the front yesterday from a stupid mistake in a parking area where I hit the railing infront of the car cuz I wasn't used to the parking spot not having deep holes that the wheels go down into🙃
Oh la la!My brand new car just got scratched and I’m having a heart attack!
just scratched my moms 2021 brand new car 😭😭
This is a super comprehensive 'do it yourself' video. I have been looking for something like this to fix a couple scratches on my truck. Thank you for sharing this. Super helpful!
After 3 attempt managed to get it right. Small scratch became big damage. Luckily everything got covered.
Great video! I'm definitely going to attempt to do this - Repair on my car. Using your step by step methods illustrated on the vid. Thanks  👍
Would rather you show the brands you use, so we can emulate your results if we need to. I recognize most of them but others will not.
Thank you for the nice video. How many cans of base paint did you use for the work done in your video?
Thanks for the great vid, it looks like you did a fantastic job!
wait what I'm doing here?  I do not even own a car !
I came to this video because I ENTER THE WRONG ENTRY FOR DRIVETHRU AND THEN I PANICKED BACK UP AND LEFT A MASSIVE SCRATCH ON MY SISTER’S CAR IM SO SCREWED
my black car has been keyed (one line around the entire car). I dont think the scratch has gone to the primer level. scratch just about catches my fingernail in most places. Is this the method I should use.
Just remember that body filler isnt for plastic and anything larger than theses tiny scratches shouldnt be filled with bondo
You didn't wet sand the Clearcoat?
If anybody would know, what’s the ratio we’re supposed to use with the hardener and the filler.
now that's how its done - perfect result!
I wish this bitch didn’t hit my car. Ugh. I hate irresponsible people.   Mind you, I was parked close to the curb and I was inside. No note, no nothing smh.
HI! Can anyone tell me what he means by overlapping passes? And what does he mean by 5 passes?
Wow thanks man excellent job
Watching this bc I fell victim to one of those decorative landscaping rocks on the edge of a parking lot exit being covered in snow and scraped the entire passenger side of my car. Been waiting for spring for fix it but hoping it's just a clear coat scratch.
Very helpful thank you.
Just scraped against a yellow light pole myself! Wish me luck guys
Waxing your freshly-painted car will hinder the color from going through the gassing process. So, be patient and wait for the car to be fully cured. Wait for about sixty (60) days before waxing your car. Also, ensure you use only real carnauba wax your vehicle when ready.
Great editing.  Video flows well.
Lolol How many people tried this.... fucked your car up.... then took it to a shop anyway?!?!?!
The previous owner of my car was a butthole apparently and got it keyed. Then my neighbors son decided to add to it. It got me $1000 off from the seller but I want it fixed 😂 so here I am
Excellent job. Thanks for sharing.
Awesome
No varnish ?
Its a professional job
no one ever uses a dirty microfiber
I just scratched and dent my car and I’m hoping I can do this as well because it’s so expensive to have this done professionally but hopefully I succeed because I need my car  looking like new anybody wanna help me !!??
I just touched my rear panel coming out the garage 😭😭😭😭 they’re small but I’ll definitely need to fill. Luckily I’m on vacation this week, I’m gonna try this. Pray for me y’all.
You did an amazing job. Nice wheels!
Excellent. Will start mine today.
Thanks for the video. Just what I was looking for
The glass of water hahahahahahaaa
You are a savior. Thank you so much
Nice work 😎
All that work. I rather pay a shop $800. Lol
Darn where u live. I need my bumper done. Im from Massachusetts haha
This is what you do when some jack@ss hits your car in the parking lot and takes off, and you don't want to pay the $250 deductible! 🤬
You made this look too easy 😂 I know I’m gonna mess it up, pray for me 😭
excellent video.  Thanks
Whats not to like about this video? Awesome job. Thank you
Hi, quick question, does the primer colour have to be the exact match with the car colour or can it be a close variant
Someone out there scratched their rental car and didn't opt for insurance. You came to the right place😭.
This is long way 🙄
Someone scratched the hood of my car with key and I am not sure how to get rid of those scratches 😢
How did you find the exact color of your car ?
Just did my car really helpful. Thumps up bro!!
This is where having an autobody technician as a dad comes in handy 😂
Glass of water too!
Hi Thomas, I want to do this on my car. Is it okay to do it outside? I don't have a garage.
Hello I’m having a bit of trouble with my paint for my camaro it says imperial blue and then there’s another option that says imperial blue 37A , 403P, GAP, WA403P. And yes I did call the dealer for help they just said blue imperial blue. My question is do you think I should just get the first option or second because I’m confused
Hey thanks, I made a mistake after applying the primer, I think I sanded too fast and the surface looks rough. Can I redo the entire primer?
Damnnnn not bad bro! But can you tell it’s not as glossy as the rest of the paint on the suv
Very informative and funny thanks 🙏
Wicked!
Do you live in Seattle ? Can I give you money to fix my car lol
watching this cause some stupid fucking bitch doesn't know how to fucking drive I swear we should have a 2 year check on who can drive and not ffs
I enjoy the good info mixed with good humor.
Where did you get your paint from
Thomas, you do a masterful job of presenting, teaching and repairing.  I salute you!  I've seen some where the guy is holding a phone in one hand and doing the work with the other, everything is fuzzy, and the final job is 3 on a scale of 10.
Wow amazing video thanks
Why blur the brand names if you're going to link to them in the description?
#CORE_CYBER helped me track my lost car he’s a genius🥰
Bro where you located ? I’ll pay you to do this 😂
Would’ve been a better result if you’d used more rubbing compound and used a polishing machine to get the shine to match the rest of the car.  I’ll give you a 7/10. Not quite finished
and i bet he a professional do this to your car if you want to lol
Very Professional video Thomas.   And only 6 minutes. You didn't try to monetize it by stretching to 10 min. +
fucked
Dude thanks. Excited to try this with my car. Any recommendations if a part of the body chipped/cracked off?  Is that the line where it needs to be dealt with professionally?
Would this work on a car that got scuffed against brick wall ?
LAME!
Is this going to last “forever” or would you have to do this a year later again??
Just about to sell my car and it scratched fml
What do you mixing with body filler?
hi nice video thanks a lot for explaining step by step and giving all the items needed. Could you tell me what kind of primer to be used ? and a link would be useful.
Cringe overload
What’s the sandable primer u used??
I scratched my moms car and I’m freaking out she cannot find out or I’ll never drive ever again
You did a really good job! Props
He just wasted the time by uploading the wrong information.
I'm watching this so I won't cry cost I'm losing my mind when I scratched my car
Is the filler necessary?
great job bro 👌
Can I do this with the whole Bumper lol?
Also if you look in the light can you tell it has been resprayed? I doubt it has as you did polish it in. But wow great job.
Great vid. Subscribed 👍
Can you also use the car paint instead of the spray paint? I couldn’t find mine in stores.
Nice job!  👍🤗
Hello, thank you. What did you do to make sure the paint doesn’t peel off after some few months?
Hey did u ever drink the water after all you hard work ??!! Ha
What primer did you use ?
Thank you for the extra tip
there are better tutorials out there.
Does the sticker in your car also said the color your paint has to be?
I am your daddy, lol. Nice job bud.
I just bought a dark smoke metallic 2005 Nissan Altima 2.5s for 1,600$ and I have scratches all over my front and rear bumpers and by the left rear door
Great tips, thanks for sharing
Wow... thats an amazing job. You have inspired me to do my bumper. THANKS.
Hell ya that helped out and was funny af
Thank you! Your video was very helpful. I Googled my paint color and I found a website called TouchUpDirect.com and it gave me all of the tools you used in one purchase for $80 out the door with a 10% discount.
So that looks amazing btw but it’s still a hair foggy, I think polish before the clear coat would’ve helped that
well my case, while i was doing an uber ride, the club bouncer told me to kept moving slowly fowarded towards the pickup zone, without me knowing, the front bumper scraped the kerb damage of 2 inches, passenger already told me about it as they saw, i had to pay $300 said the rental company.
Some professional advice, 100 dude
Hi Thomas, thx for video, i have to say pretty usefull. I got the scratched on my car the same place as you did. One question: did you get high lat gloss surfice after that? Mine is shine not gloss. Did your gloss got by polishing? thx in advance. 👍
Bang up job mate👍
Was wondering how to get the color spray? Did i skipped something?
this is the total meaning of tutorial on how to fix the deep scratch on your car. good job
Who’s watching this after finding a note under their windshield wiper with no contact details? No? Just me?
Nice job.
you not a bad driver you just had a bad day💘
Fire video bro
That repair is not going to last long paint is going to start coming off
what sandable primer did you use?
Thanks man, my fix turned out way better than expected 😅
Where did you shop for the stuff you needed?
Brother this is one amazing video on fixing scratches. Keep it up!!!!!
It’s not a bad car, but it’ll never be a real Jeep.
Wow..
That’s pretty awesome
Amazing bro 👏
Nice job
Amazing video, thank you for this
I want to try this but I’m afraid I’ll mess up. 😂 Especially the part with using the sand paper to “sand” the car before applying bondo. Any tips of not to make a mess in case I screw up??? Don’t want to be stuck with a scratched even worse car lol.
This looks so easy until you try it on your own car 😂😂
Thanks for the tutorial!
No need for now. Just found this video while looking for interior dashboard scratches. But I subscribed. I have few little scratches exterior like next to wheels but not big deal. I have couple scratches on rims as well :D thanks
Yeah I’m here because the pole hit me.🙃
Just Scratched my Momma Honda...again! I'm gonna go cry!
yikes over $700 for that? someone hit my car in a parking lot and it only cost about $450 to fix the scratches, and it was on multiple panels. With metallic paint, so it's even more difficult to fix.
Someone just scratched my car yesterday and ran. That’s why I’m here 🙄
Where all of this stuff you buying? Its auto zone selling them
Nice
Can you do this while its cold outside?
IF DONT WANT NOBODY TO SEE WHAT ARE YOU USEING THEN DONT PUT THE FUCKING VIDEO ASSHOLE
Can you do this same process on all bumpers or are some different than others?
Looks like I’m about to get Handy and do this because the shop is trying to charge me 400 to paint just one part of my bumper.
THANK YOU!!! YOU ARE BOMB
Thomas, what if your color is not  available in a spray can? ie has to be painted on with a paint brush? Technique? Thanks again! Michael
dude..that's impressive
wow nice
You didn't show the reflexion from the area. It doesn't look like it is glossy.
How do you match the car color
Some asshole did a hit and run :/ here I am now lol
Nice one
Hi. Just wondering how to pick the right paint colour for my car? My one is gray, similar to your video.
Hi so im on the website where you got the paint clear coat and sandable primer, my car is gold but they dont have that option should i just choose grey since its close to the color?
End result's fantastic👍 & you're hilarious😄
Sooo did anyone manage to repair without getting it worst?
Hello, did the video show where you added clear coat?
Brilliant, love your dry sense of humour with it
Dont understand why would you not show the product you did use this is not helpful at all
This looks so good! But I’m afraid to try it on my car 😬
Where are you located. Can you come and do my car like that
Great video but you needed to go thicker with the clear coat to really bring out the gloss. keep up the good work.
Will this work only in bumper/plastic or body as well?
I drive my dad's car and scratch it badly,  now going to fix it asap myself before he returns home and find out......
Very good job
This dude give me confidence that i can do it by myself lol but the best thing about me is I’m not afraid taking risks by trying new things! Wish me good luck y’all.
I have a Toyota Corolla 2009 silver . I couldn’t find the paint on the side of my door . Can it be any silver ? Please help , I did all the steps but I used some paint off eBay which was very expensive and it was very little I need more paint but need more spots to fill out. Thank you
BIG TIP : if you have multiple deep spots . Make sure to use the bondo (body filler) in small portions. I didn’t know but I poured a lot and it all dried up quick . It was my first time using this .
Very nice..   good job Mr
very good sharing..
I just messed up my squarebody hope this works thanks
Does it end up looking different than the rest of the paint on the car? How did you blend it into the other paint on the car? I have scratches on the door that I'd like to repair oh, and the body shop wants to charge me $1,200 CAD to take off the door sand it and paint it  I don't need it to be perfect. The car is an older vehicle, I just need it to look not obvious
👍👍👍
How did the bondo last? You can't really use that on flexible plastic usually it will crack.
Good job thank you for that information. Something just happened to my car recently and this video is very helpful.
Wow you did it fully legit👏👏👏i have hope to do it myself with 1/10th of all the products you had though but hoping for the same results lol
Good job
This is the best thing I have ever seen in my liiiiiiiiiife!!!! Need to fix the deep scratches in my truuuuuuuck! This gives me hoooooooooope!
Hey everyone, the best results that I have ever had was by using the Magic Painter Method (i found it on google) without a doubt the most helpful info that I have ever followed.
SWEET IM TRYING IT!!
If anyone is interested in spray painting the greatest success that ive had was by following the Magic Painter Method (i found it on google) definately the most useful info that I've followed.
hi guys, the greatest results that ive ever had was by following the Magic Painter Method (just google it) definately the most incredible course i've followed.
If you is interested in spray painting the greatest results that ive ever had was by following the Magic Painter Method (i found it on google) definately the no.1 info that I have ever tried.
me watching this after crashing my car into my grandmas gate
Also didn’t prep the old paint work for primer, meaning that it’ll flake lol cowboy
That job would be about £100-150 just the bottom of the number and light scratches, don’t listen to this clown
this 6min video is going to take me 6hr it all look easy when you watch it.
I'm super excited to try this after scratching my car rushing into my parking garage. I just wanted to ask how exact of a match is the paint you suggested we use? My paint job has a bit of "sparkle" or glitter or whatever you want to call it, so I was wondering if it would keep that same minor detail?
Thanks so much.  That was brilliant 🙂
Very helpful, thanks!
How did you match the exact colour?
I just bought a car with little scratches front bumper that vert below and I just opened YouTube to see how to fix it then saw the very first your video wow that was great but don’t have idea how to do it.🥲
what happens if you do this in cold weather outside?
good
My car is black. What happens if I skip all the sanding and just paint it ?
that glass of water 🤣🤣🤣
Do you even need a clear coat
Did that 😎💯
Excellent !!!!!!
What if your car is a red color ?
wow! you did an amazing job! loved the video! ❤️
Great video especially tip to check door for paint match.
Great Job!  I love when shared knowledge gives people OPTIONS.
Umm can you pls come to Melbourne and quickly do it for me before my dad kills me 😅
What do you mean by covering more and more areas?
Great job Bro! I used your video to repair some gnarly scratches on my CLS 500. Saved me at least $1,000.
Great job man 👍
I had my in-laws car scratched 😂
Lovely video. Simple yet effective explanation 😊👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼. Thanks much
I really enjoyed your re-enactment 🤣 thanks for sharing this video! Great info
Wow it’s looking good
Can I do the same process with chipped paint ? For instance like the hood of my car
Finally a good how to on youtube.
Did you miss out the primer link in material list or i am confusing it.
but the sandblasting part is so scary 😭
short and to the point LOVE IT!! im using this for my laptop btw, planning to get rid of the dents
Feeennnnnnnnnnnnnnntassssticcccccccccccccccccccc   Job  , Mate .
Did you have an issues with overspray?
Subscribed
You're not funny just continue the video normally
Good vid ,I done this on a vw fox to flip ,now looks like new and sold it for double thanks
Thanks for the video content! Apologies for chiming in, I am interested in your thoughts. Have you tried - Tarbbatigan Cars Rehabilitation Tip (erm, check it on google should be there)? It is a good exclusive product for learning how to repair your car the easy way without the headache. Ive heard some incredible things about it and my old buddy Taylor at very last got amazing results with it.
So I have two questions what if there’s some rust on some of the spots, would there be an extra step? and what if there’s been some spray paint added just put on top, would you still be able to remove with these steps?
No ones going to say anything about how its an Asian dude teaching how to fix scratches 😂
Great video!  Just few dumb questions.. do I need both base coat and clear coat paint of the same color of my car? Or just clear coat? Also, is touch up paint same as clear coat paint? Thanks
Good job dude. You’re hilarious.
I’m doing this this week haha my sister did two scratches on my car and she don’t wants to fix it or do anything about it 😢
You painted just the scratches so how does that blend nicely with surrounding area with no overlapping?
That’s good if the paint on your car is a basic color but what if it’s green or turquoise? How do you match the color?
Omg where are u from ???
This would leave over spray all over the bumper and pieces near it
Came here immediately because my wife just hit a curb....my poor datsun 😭
Thank u. I needed this video
Dude body filler or niki doesn’t stick to paint that filler will seperate from the surface after a while and your back to square one this is why painters or beaters strip the paint back to bare metal or plastic to repair the area good job if your gonna sell the car real quick though and it’s not your problem anymore
Thank you! Question - Can this be done outside during winter? If yes, is there a way to calculate drying time based on temperature? If not, what can I do to prevent rusting while I wait for a warm spring day?
I know we cant expect perfect results, so im not knocking but just asking genuinely, there is significantly less "shine" and "clear coat" presence on the fixed area compared to the rest. It seems that way just want to confirm
All I learn is to Buffing so you can be Buff
Worked beautifully on my Acura I can’t lie. Thanks for this video
Thanks for this excellent video Thomas. Your Jeep looks great after you finished. I plan on doing this same process on my car but I don't know which sandable primer color to get. My car is a dark graphite metallic (darker grey). Should I use the black sandable primer spray? I think your Jeep color made it simple to choose from since your car's grey is similar to the primer color grey.
Haahha i think this not pro job, but is ok for your self car, not  for customer
Nice will try this i have the same exact scratches on my front driver side, very helpful thanks.
Some idiot hit my 2018 G70 last night and left a nice scratch on it. So annoyed. This literally just saved me!!
THANK YOU!!!
Wow, you did a great job!
Nice work!
Scratched my dad’s car twice in a day😭
You are funny...how are your “buffed” arms doing?🤣
Good job my man!
this is like make up for cars. too complex for a simple female like me. is there no nailvarnish equivalent!? haha
Nice job
Hello. I liked the content. Your art is similar to Oli Mueller. His stuff low-key reminds me of Draw with Jazza mixed with a blend of Andy Warhol! He is a awesome digital artist in the US.  You should definitely check out his YT out and give the artist a like! 👉 #DayInTheLifeOfOliMueller
Awesome 👍
Great job
Is clear coat needed?
I wanna do this but i am afraid i will miss it up and make my car look worse
A mother f scratched my car noticed this when I was leaving work 😡😡😡😡
Thanks! Liked the Amazon and add to cart to buy all!👍👍👍
so by the way ,where can buy the tools?thanks again
subscribed! thanks a lot as it is so useful  to relive my worried about the scratched just did of my baby and dear car!
Great job man
It's called having the time and patience
I wish this YouTuber was within driving distance. I would just pay him to fix the scratches on my car. 🤷😁
If i dont want to use the primer coat, and skip it to basecoat and clearcoat.can or cannot?
Will a simple clear coat stand the test of time though? I feel like it not being baked on will be an issue.
Not bad considering you didn't use any clear coat lol. Would've been 1000x better if you did
This was funny!!
Ok, after watching this, $800 is not that much...
why did you cover the labels lolol
Its a backyard repair with backyard results.
How do you find the matching paint?
Just scratched my gf moms car I’m fucked 😢
Looks real good 👍 👍
Why did you need body filler if you sanded the the scratches smooth to match the rest of the bumper ?
Genius. Thank you.
You are really cool man
I want to send you a free inflatable paint booth. Please contact me at Sewinfla@outlook.com
That eeeezzz fennnnnnntaaastic Mite... Love that You're Not That Jack....🤪🤪
My wife’s dad just scratched the bike that I bought her less than a month ago 🥸
Do you absolutely need to use bondo to fix? And if so can I get away with using pre-mixed filler? Thanks for the video!
That was a very detailed and useful DIY video.  Now I have some confidence to tackle my own bumper scratch repair.
Great video. I have to repair deep scratches on my Vito front bumper. I don't expect to do as good a job as this but this video will certainly help.
How many of y’all are crying right now because something happened to your vehicle. 😢🤚
I still give you like for the video :)
Good hard work, but the area you painted does not have the same shine as the rest of the bumper. You saved but the bumper only looks good from one angle.
Nicely done, both the car repair and video. Thanks.
Thnks for DIY
Excellent job :)
I locked my keys in my car yesterday after work & then today in the morning decided to clean the inside of my car at home not realizing that I scratched the front of my car ugh! What would you recommend ? I scratched it against a brick wall. Thank you 😊
Really appreciate your video, but I appreciate your wit even more. Mahalo!
Love this guys humor!😂
How to Bypass Oxgen sensor in any car 😯 👉🏻https://youtu.be/k4Iaigwy7oI👈🏼
WOW
Great video guy. Impressive what can be achieved with some simple tools and likely a fair amount of talent and patience.  Other videos I watched had super bodgy results with filler pens. I was wondering if there was a less dodgy method.  ....you don’t happen to be related to that guy who fills in with 2 min noodles do you? 😝 that guy also does really impressive work.
CRV SE heater wants get hot show me the video
Does this work on a little deeper scratches? I guess just sanding off paint that has peeled+ filler will do the job?
Imagine you just put toothpaste on it like the disks
Please can we use any color of sandable primer
Damn
It's really very useful,, thanks,, l have the same problem hope to do it successfully,,
This is a professional's job, it would take a thick neck to give it a go if you have no patience. Good luck!
3:33 “Remember the water from earlier? *I actually didn’t drink it😄* “ 😂😂 outta the random lol
For someone who speaks slowly on the video, you do make your texts fade rather quickly.
You made this look so easy. The results looks professional. Someone hit and run me in a McDonald's parking lot,  shop told me $800 to fix  it. Or $1000 to replace and paint the new bumper. Thanks for sharing.
Damn...that's pretty good!!!
Love this so much! Thanks for the tutorial and for not making the intro half of your video lol
Can you please come do my car I will pay you
I think you got away with this technique because the color is fairly light.  I am trying to figure out how you managed to not have serious issues with the touch up paint overspraying onto the rest of the undamaged/unscratched/unprepped surface....you doubtlessly have paint on the top of the clearcoat of the adjoining area.  The only answer I believe is that it doesn't show because the paint color is light.
I have a similar area like in video - a paint/dent guy on Craigslist said he'd do for $180 after showing photos. Considering if I should trust him? I'd be a little surprised if there's any "overnight" procedure, I assume he's doing this in 1 day, so...how effective could it be? It's his profession, so I also assume he's a "professional", and said it would be like new when he's done. Opinions? I'd pay the extra $60 or so to have a "pro" do this. I'm not a skilled spray painter.
No clear coat or did I miss something?
I won’t ever trust myself to do all this... I’ll leave the scratches 🤦🏾‍♀️
nice job man, i also read the description and i concur, def use a wax after polish, so u can protect/seal the job u just did, the sanding with 2500 before compound is only necessary if you are compound by hand, if u use a machine and proper compound pad, u can skip the 2500 sanding
That's totally amazing 🔥
goof off also works
Wait I already know how to do this, why Iam I here 😂😂😭
Funny....
Good job, and thanks for the very informative video.  I might try this on my scratched bumper.
Thanks
This was a very helpful video made it seem like it is so easy to fix yourself I’m going to try this in 5 different ares of my car I have the kit now just have to do the work hopefully turns out as well as yours thx
Can you use any sandals primer? I can’t find it on the site
The wax is the last step you left out but very good job you did on your own car. The results were very  impressive. I bought a used car with scatches and needed some perspective in the matter.
Kinda crashed into my grandma car and ima get my ass beat if i dont get this fixed🤣
This is the most entertaining tutorial I've ever seen. Good job Thomas! 👌
U'r ligit... ty
Messing just pay the dude to do it
Just ordered the stuff ! I’ll update with how it went 😅😅
Good Video fam its very helpful deadass b
I scratched my daughter's car ...this is so helpful...doing it....Thank you so much...
Did you get any orange peel ?
Nice video.  Drink your water, it's the best thing for you.
Bought second hand car of bad luck driver, so trying to fix various dents and scratches to make the car look a little nicer again.
Was being stupid today and scrapped all down the side of my car gonna be doing these steps tomorrow wish me luck😬
Where to buy the materials & paints ? Is it from the car dealer?
That was grate !👍
😂
That's awesome! You're a riot!
Please send me the website link that you bought everything for $120
Well done
Very helpful. Thanks.
Thanks for this video! what primer did you use?
Am here because i scratched my car and pissed my husband with my terrible driving skills so hopefully I become a pro at fixing my mess cheaply 😂 😂
I still love her, its just a car right?

Could I do this on side doors?
Great video!  Just for some of you rookies out there, if you look up how much the replacement part is, sometimes it’s not that expensive.  You could just purchase a new one, and paint it yourself if it just comes primed, or, you can follow the instructions in this video.  Also, if you don’t know how to do it, it’s okay, you will figure it out. Just be patient and don’t get frustrated.  Good luck.
Ok,  So I have gone through the process.  Actually a couple of times, my conclusion is that the end result is not as polished or glossy as the original paint. It looks like mate when you comparing with the original paint (silver metallic gray MB 2017) The color is not exactly but almost, however the glossy part (3rd layer) is FAR.   Any tip for this?   I have wet sandpaper 2000 to 3000 after the gloss was dried overnight (5 layers). Polish with wax turtle and then buff manually with a microfiber.
Not bad! 🤔🤙🏽
I would have just paid $800.  This is not an easy job.
Thanks great info
Great work guys

How much time does it take to do all the steps? Thank you
lol thank you for this!! Somebody I knew paid over a thousand dollars because of a cosmetic scuff like that. Ugh.
This is a lot harder than it looks. You got to have patience, the correct paints and skill.... especially skill. Getting a decent looking paint job is tough enough. A perfectly blended in job almost impossible. Wish they would make waterproof stickers to match paintwork for a temporary "repair".
Looks great despite William's opinion!
Great video. Now I'm going to fix my 2018rx350
This video was really well done!  It was both helpful and very clear with step-by-step instructions.  Thanks!
Can I hire you??
Well done. Enjoyed your humour too.
....how
What is the point of blocking of the name on the cans of paint?
Great video thanks.....but after reading some of the interesting DIY comments, I don’t thinks I’ve got the ⚽️ ‘s to do this on my car! 😁
My first time hitting anything, I scraped  the barrier that protects the gas pump when I was pulling out, I was surprised that the barrier had more damage then my truck, it sounded loud
Super job! thanks.
I am eeyour daddy ...
Awesome video thank you.
Wow, that looks amazing! I need to do this to my car. Just need to find the right paint match
Hello,  my ex keyed the fuck out of my car, and it’s deep, would this work in my situation as well?
https://www.ebay.com/itm/363129431237
Some jerk just  hit my parked Mercedes ML 350.Hit and run,someone got the license,,but my insurance says you pay the 500 deductible,I told them no.My damage is very similar to yours.
But this repair not cheap either...
Where do you buy the primer?
You did a good job can’t even tell u did it U did it I just paid $800 for a new painted bumper if I could have did it myself I would have save a lot of money
One of the best repair videos I've seen
Dude you did such a awesome job repairing that huge scratch.My Dad & I are going to do the same thing on my 2015 Sentra.I am going to send him your video.My Dad was a Car Buyer & I doubt he could tell you painted your car.I just subscribed.Thanks!
Is it true that you shouldn't wash that area for a while? You can rinse but not wash?
Someone scratched my fucking car in a parking so now I’m here 🙄
ماشاء الله تبارك الله👍👍 😂🤣🤘👀🇸🇦
This just depressed me
hi everyone ,if anyone else trying to find out car spray painting course try Sovallo   Auto Painting Fixer (do a search on google ) ? Ive heard some incredible things about it and my mate got great results with it.
Bitchass neighbor parked behind my car..told them to move and they barely gave me room to park..my space is by a pole so when i tried to back out it lightly scratched thank god it wasnt a dent.
What about the lower area “darker black”. Got couple scratches in mine and would like to clear it up
I just scratched my mom's car today and I happened to come across this video 😂😂😂
I thought my car was small enough to pop a U 😔
Like a champ!
Please don't try this at home  🤣
Can I just use a drill and circular wet sandpaper Grit instead of by hand?????????
Great video..enjoyed your sense of humor as well !!
After doing all these steps, Finally you are ready to open your own Dent and paint shop.. Lolz
mhh. I rolled over my suburban last week it still drives but every panel is caved in. the roof shifted 10inches to the right. am about to DIY like you did in this video. looks easy.
Will this work on metal?
Pls come and do mine
Great job and the humor was great w/o going overboard!
I followed all the valuable instructions here but the end result was not as shiny as the original paint. If you want the super shiny look , after painting and before applying the clear coat, there is a step you need to do to get that super shiny look. It is called "color sanding" which is wet sanding the paint with 1500 sandpaper to make it smooth. The reason is to remove the orange peel bumps on the paint, think of the mirror and the smooth silver layer behind the glass. It is not only the glass that makes the mirror shiny but the smoothness of the silver layer beneath. Glass in this analogy being the clear coat and the silver is the paint. Thanks for the video Thomas, saved me a lot of money.
What about the clear coat ? I did not see you spray it ?
After buffing, my arms are now buffed! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🔥🔥
😂😂😂
I have 2hrs to fix my scratches before my dad see it
i think this is the best video , which i have seen soo far
Does it look as shiny as its original paint? At the end of the video it kind of looks like that particular part of the vehicle doesn’t have enough shine like it wasn’t waxed. Do I make sense?  I just want to make sure if I do this to my Jeep it gets the same shiny color and no spots that look dry
Htt bc
wow!! sooo good!! is the bumper plastic or metal?
Hi, thanks for video. Do you use any particular liquid to clean after using wet 2500 sandpaper? ( Right before using base color)
Great job
Great job and thank you !!
i thought the scratch doctor would do all this..lol
nice vid
And also the paint would only last 3weeks max then it will fade.
This only applies to vehicles with generic colors aerosol paints has limited color range and varies color depending on brand.
Seems like a professional.  Origin of big muscles - buffing polish? I don’t like the looks of your daddy:)
I had a similar issue on my suv. I masked off the bumpers and rocker and quarter panels about 10" high. I then had a local company spray the areas with truck box liner. Looks cool and will out last the rest of the body.
I paid (Maaco ) $1,700 to fix scratches on my bumper and repaint the car and all they did was repaint over the scratches I’m am unhappy about that. They said there was no way to get out the scratches and I need to buy a new bumper but you proved that it can be done I wish I knew I would have done it myself
Nice job
But what about a very tiny scratch? Do we need all that? Talking 4 inch wide
Seeing that this is 2 years old, how did it work for you? Is it still looking good?
How much time does this take? With prep and all? I'm guessing for someone who hasn't done this half a day? Bc I have not that much time on my hands and would love to be able to do this
Nice, funny to
You are my hero!!!
GREAT JOB!
Bro you KILLED it!!!👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
I just scratched my mom’s car a bit, I’m praying this works
i came here because my dogs used my car as a scratching post
Luckily no magic spray n done, good job for the vid
2020 The Chinese & the American markets are created a Nano Coating Body Finish Shine Spray but I recommend this Old fashion way Bondo /Primer/Painting/ect
I'll have to do this seeing my mom don't know how to park a rv and smashed my car
Which coat did u use first i am confused
I have bubbles in my hood can I use this same method to fix it ?
Can yoy do this on bigger areas or just small ones
Helpful! Even liked the corny humor.
what if I can't find a 225 grit what other option do I have
Does this work for the doors too or just the bumper? Somebody put a deep scratch in my door.
5:04 Dab some compound.
I followed the instructions, however I really screwed up because I taped a box around the area where the scratches were. I think I used too much primer too. It didn’t drip, the new paint is just raised up higher than the old paint. After I put the last layer of clear coat on, i peeled the tape off and I realized the paint was not blended at all to the paint around it. It just looks like patches instead of matching the cars finish. I also got overspray from the primer on the area outside the tape. I don’t know how to remedy any of this. So any help would be appreciated.   Do I spray more paint around the area to level it off? Do I wet sand the edges until they’re lower?  I really feel like an idiot because my car looks way worse off than before, simply because I taped it off instead off leaving the area open and blending it better  like I was supposed to. Feelsbadman :/
The line at the bottom??????
If you want better results, sand the clear coat around the affected area with 800-1000 grit before you primer just don't breakthrough. Don't spray primer where the clear coat is shiny and glossy or it will eventually peel.
Planning on working on this. Thank you for the video, I have a simple question. When do you determine that the body filler is necessary? I can see that my scratch removed the paint and the primer but the plastic under looks intact, however i can feel the gap with the nail. In this case the primer+paint+gloss should re-fill that scratch, or should I use body filler regardless? Thank you!
I love the commentary jokes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You added "Note" at top that says: Some of the comments suggested to use 2500 or higher grit sand paper after the paint is dry right before buffing to make it shinier and smoother -- Do you mean use 2500 grit after the clear coat (not paint) is dry before start buffing? Eman
Buffing part!! 🤣🤣
This was frigging hilarious.  You're funny dude. I appreciate goofiness.
The labor and time involved is why the price was $$$$
Question 1: Where can I look up what paint color matches my car? QUESTION 2: My scratches are on my door handle. The handle is same color as paint on car. Will this process work for that application?
The result 😍
Thank you so much for this! Mine didn’t turned out quite as well as yours but I’m still happy with it, proud of it, and $700 richer for it. Without it pointed out, really not noticeable at all.   Also want to say that because this video required multiple views (since I’m sure most viewers were watching it in between steps) the jokes actually got funnier every time they came up! Happy you peppered that in
just got my dads car scratched 💀 and the paint peeled off, hopefully i wake up early enough to cover some of it up so he won’t beat my ass😭 ty for the video!!! hopefully i live to see another one
This is just perfect. Thank you so much.   In my country (Iraq) the paint shop will repaint the whole car with the same color code for only (400 to 1000 USD) depends on the type of the car and paint.  They would paint my 2014 dodge challenger, for 800$, the whole car.  But they don't fix deep scratches if it was only in a small area like yours, because it's not beneficial for them, so they would offer to repaint the whole bumper for 100$.  However, they usually put a lot of body filler, without fine leveling, which cause some of the parts to be thicker then the original ones,   (not noticeable by eye, but it can be discovered by special paint thickness measurement tools)  So, having a whole door, bumper, hood ..etc, painted to fix deep scratches, will make my car lose at least 2000 to 4000$ from its value, according to the comon knowledge in our used cars market.  That's why I would like to do the job myself, and fix the scratched lines only.
damn son you did a excellent job
this is so harder than it looks cuz i tried before. It is very easy to mess up the paint!!!!!!!!! Then, it pains your as.s...sss
pillar men theme
my compound, primer, and sandpaper have  arrived but my actual paint hasn't! do you think it's alright if i start the process and wait for a couple days with the filler on my car without painting it?
did you do all this in one day?
You are cute. How old are u?💋😍
Where did you buy the can with the paint?
One of the best How To videos I have ever scene.  Very nicely done!  Thank you for taking the time.
5:25 you all are going to get arthritis doing this.  I rather use an electric motor sander scrubber or not do it at all than using up my joints on looks.
How can I match the paint colour (white) without going to the dealership? It's the BMW alpine white.
Did you end up spray painting the whole front bumper?
I will try this scarched my husband car last night on a massive rock. 😟 This looks really good
Great video
Thanks for the video.  Question, you mentioned :buffer" in the end, did you mean using a buffering machine or just manuallyt rub it with towel? I didn't see a buffer machine operation in the video. Thanks a lot, just got a scratch today on the front side of my car.
0:53 Love this moment
I have a hole about the size of a baby’s fist on my bumper. Can you make a video on how to get it out?
You'd think a mustang would be the one hitting someone but here I am because someone hit me💔
Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge! I have a silver Toyota Solara Convertible that had some bad scratches that hugged the corner of my right rear bumper so the scratches spread from the rear to the side. Following your step by step instructions I was able to fix it and it worked out GREAT! Thank you SOOO much! I can't believe I did this! I have to disagree with some of the comments below that this is harder than it looks. Complete opposite for me. It was MUCH EASIER than it looks you just have to be patient, buy the exact right paint that fits your car and buy the other accessories mentioned and go step by step slowly. Wasn't that difficult at all. And I paid less than $100.00 for all the material with plenty left over for future touch ups or scratches. May need to buy more 1500 and 2500 sand paper but that's about it. One thumbs up doesn't seem like enough. More like a thousand!
Great job
After clear coat no flatting off before compound ??
Hey man. I follow your video step by step. It came out fine but I have some issues here. I put 3 coat of clear coat. The thing is is not shunning as the old paint and there is some part that rough not smooth.. what should I do? Should I sandpaper it again then do the clear coat? Pls help
Good job. Very helpful
Thank you for sharing. This was a learning experience for me.
Man I would of drank that water bro. Ha
Your work came out perfect bro Im running out to buy the material to get started. Thanks for the inspiration and saving me money.
That is amazing!
Someone ran their bike into my new car today and I was praying if anyone out there could show me how to fix it myself.  I thank you for taking time to create this excellent tutorial!  I prayed for this and God answered - thank You Lord!
Some scumbag keyed my moms car yesterday
Great video, informative and quite humerous. It has been made simple enough for most to have the confidence to give it a go and build experience. Ontop of that the auther is still responding to comments 2 years later !  Wow
Is it Permanent solution
Does scratch remover such as 3M also work too? I am wondering since it's easier to apply and cheaper
I got 3 days to fix a massive scratch on my mum's car before she comes home. Wish me luck guys 😭 or cya at my funeral
How long will this lasts
hi what is the best wayto remove those part of the paint thats been mask  its like a dividing line. could i sand it?  to flatten it?  thank you
Very entertaining lol! Thanks I needed this video 👍🏽🙏🏽✝️
1.7K dislikes from repair shops 😂
I have similar scratches but I only have the small nail polish brush version of my paint. Any suggestions on where I can get a spray version?
Dude spent the $800.00
This is a good video on how to restore the finish of your car after a minor incident at the parking lot or your drive way. It is definitely harder than it looks because he sped up the video, this will take several hours from start to finish, not including the time that you mess up and had to redo it again. A few things I would do it differently though as I think he did not do it right. Before applying the primer to the bumper, he also should scrub up the entire area with 1500 sand paper where he will apply primer for better adhesion for longer durability of the paint job. Second, he should has mask off the entire front end of the car to prevent the paint overspraying from landing on them and he has to clean them off later. Last but not least, the paint looks fine at 4-5 ft away but if you look closely, you will see that there could be color mismatch or the clear coat did not blend smoothly at the edges of the paint area. That is why the body shop will charge $800-1000 to repaint the entire bumper, not just the repair spot to ensure that the paint color match perfectly and there is smooth transition between the repair spot and the rest of the bumper. This repair will definitely save money, what you do not know is that how long this repair will last as compared to the proper job at the body shop.
So this where all the bad drivers hang out lol...Great Video, Great job, I totally subscribed
fuckyeah man
a lot save of money
Love that this video was very clear and well organized. Thank you!
Amazing job!
Save this for my Husband ❤️🙏
You didn’t need filler for that on but but came out nice
Dad : MY CAR GOT SCRATCH BY SOME HOLAGAN.... AHHHH I GONNA FIND THEM AND GIVE THEM A LESSON...  Me : Um... wheres the scratch... I see nothing... *Shows dad the thumbnail of this video* SEE THIS IS CALL A SCRATCH... AND THIS IS MORE OBVIOUS...  Dad : Wait you are watching this video... I CAN DO BETTER THAN HIM.... 10minutes later.... Dad : *Goes outside checks the surrounding* Ah yes finally... I can watch this video that my son showed me... hmmm lets seee how to fix my car with this tutorial.... ahhh yesss I got it....
Great explanation,  great demonstration,  great video and sound.  And love the funny vid background too. 👍
The primer, you used, does it work well on plastic-like bumper?
Could you please provide the links where I can get all the items
Now I just have to wait for the fires to be gone so I can go outside again
I used to work at an autobody shop.  I think the  highest grit we used to wet sand was 1000.  The body shop wanted 450 because they wanted to paint the whole bumper cover.  I ordered the 3 cans of spray on paint , primer and clear for 51.00, a can of bondo for 8.  Never done a job quite this big but thats about how fucked up mine is. When I have more money and more damage I can order a new cover for 119.00 and have it painted but I have seen enough body work done that I'd never pay 450.00
Lmao how he mentions he didnt drink the water
What sandable primer do y’all recommend?
Apparently your overspray onto the undamaged areas of the bumper magically blended & smoothed themselves out. Do the job right & not halfa$$ed: respray the entire bumper or you will end up with a noticeable patch. There's a reason shops charge a lot.
this guy is the BIG epic
😂😂 God bless you man! This how I like my tutorials.
this dude with the water.... what a fucking boss!
Ordered a paint kit online hoping to save my car. Great tutorial.  Some stranger  keyed my car door both sides and windscreen rubber while it was parked. I’m absolutely gutted about it. Finished work to the worst surprise ever.
Amazing job.
When buffing with polish compound, it leaves a thick white residues in the buffed area, it also showed some orange color around the edge of the white film....when tried removing them with much elbow effort, it does come off, however, it removes the paint as well to the point my filler on the scratches are showing....any idea why that happen?
thanks for this video bro. I have been wanting to get my side skirts repainted but shops are charging me 250-300. The damage is basically the whole side skirts.
1:40 most important tool, don’t miss it
This is so ironic cause I got a Jeep to lolol
After doing it my self, It's important to note the following experiences: 1) Be prepared for at least 6 hours of work 2) Try to put as little filler as possible but the right amount or else you will be sanding half a day. 3) Don't overdo the paint, cause once it drips and try to fix it, ur are gonna end up leaving little bumps on the paint and there's no going back unless u want to sand and paint again and again. 3) For sure wear a mask and glasses 4) be extra patient.
All the dislike for this video came from car body shops that ll be out of business 🤣😂. I ev not tried it but have high Hopes. Thanks for sharing!
Never donate to a Demoncrat.
good video mate nice one
Great job sir.
Thank you for sharing this video with  everyone and the links are really helpful. Thanks again. You got another subscriber.
Golden humour.
Awesome video man you did a really great job and good info
Who's your daddy. nice video bro
Link to sandable primer please?
How much all the material cost you
Dude these people took your video lol  https://pin.it/52h9cn2
Bravo. And funny.
Dam, dealership really ripped you off.
Great video! Thanks!
Hi Thomas: this looks easy.... I just scratched in the same are as your car!
I'm surprised there was no over spray
$120 for the supplies. $500-$600 for the labor depending on quality of work. Now you know why they charge $700 at the car shop. The supplies are always fixed costs.
Don't follow this advise.  Bondo will fall off if you don't and the car well.
How you scrape the bumper but not the lower valance which seems to have escaped completely..... I bet power DA polishing would give improve on that finish.
I think he forgot to apply  the wornich
Look new
Do you need the sandable primer?  I just have the other 2
You painted over 180 grit sand scratches????..Good lord..the paint will def sink and you WILL see all those sand scratches...needed to finish with around 320, prime and then sand again...
Literally have the same car but orange. I backed into a pole the other day and got a little paint scratch. 🥺
If I have deep dents on the body of my car, would I fix that first before working on the scratches?
ok. i bought the parts and i am waiting for your response before i apply it on my gt86...  1- do i actually need to sand the scratch? can i not apply filler straight away? 2- how long do i need to wait between each coat? 3- do i need to apply light coat and then base coat? 4- how close do i need to keep the spray to the car? 5- if the result is terrible, can i sand it and start from scratch?
Save hundreds of dollars  Spends hundreds of dollars to repair😂
Now no one will know your wife drove your car.
You saved me alot frustration and money.
how do i get the right paint color for my car
Awesome fix, good job, funny too
This is B S he would of had overspray all over and no blend of the basecoat or clear
Thomas of all... I liked your videos so you owe me 800-120=680$ now
Very nice job.  After all that, I would suggest a pure sealant like Poorboy's EXP or Zaino, several others.
You did a great job!!!!
You’re awkwardly hella funny haha
Thanks man! Through this, I could save like around 300$! So stupid of me to rub my left bumper to a post. It’s a brand new Honda Civic sport 2020, just a week old. Yet I managed to damage it just like that! Fingers cross and hope the outcome will be great. Btw my car is blue, is it ok to use the same color primer that you used on this video? Thanks and Godbless Man!
Hey Bro, I’m trying to do this on my Black 2017 Lexus. Will this work?
800USD .... HAHAHA local private profi-paint 80-120€ in Praha, Budapest , Bratislava ...
Good job
😍👌🏻
How you match ur paint
Wow this is awesome 👏
Can you help me please
You didn't even key the painted area, that's gonna fall off in about a month. And when that's in the sun I bet you it looks absolutely horrendous.
3:09 lol
sexy
I done everything right. Except I sprayed my car green when it is black. Doctor later told me I suffer severe colour blindness.
My car clr code is 3r3 . In your video you don’t share the website name where did you buy your colors for your Jeep.
Good work. Should off used 2000grit on clear coat before compound and polish👍
Love that "I'm your daddy" part 🤣🤣
Thank you for sharing this video.  What brands do you recommend for sandable prime, basecoat color, and gloss clear coat?
Nice work. So you just spray it with the paint and it blends in perfectly wow.
Bro. This was hella helpful. I jus subbed mayne. I Appreciate it
What brand did you buy for the sandable primer, basecoat color, and the gloss clear coat?
How do you get a base coat paint
Awesome repair job!
800 dollars !!! I had a similar repair done by a mobile specialist in the uk for £100.Regarding this video,you need to use much finer wet and dry paper to finish off, then panel wipe and tack cloths or just IPA on lint free cotton to remove any coatings or dust left.When masking off its easier to use paper and tape,not just tape on its own and cover a large  area you dont want to get overspray on.Having said that you ended up with a pretty good job,well done
How can I contact you to repair my tesla model 3 with similar scratches
I wanna give this a try; backed into a light pole yesterday night. It was too dark and loud.. but I'll try it on my mom's car first just so that I get the hang of it.😂
Thanks for the great video! Great tutorial ... and kind of hilarious.
Very well done 👏
Hi Thomas, what's the difference between the body repair kit you've linked and the Bondi Fiberglass Resin?  Sorry if the question is silly, I'm new to this.
p800, p1500, p2500 csiszolópapír
Why is car bumpers so fragile, my brother crashed into my car with his scooter and there’s a big scratch almost like the one in this video🤦🏽‍♂️
Good job man maybe I start doing as well
The spray can paint is really rough compared to my car paint. It's also not nowhere near as shiny. Also when I did the rubbing compound after a day some if the paint started rubbing off and the finish looks awful.
Wow! Superb job. I have quite a bit of body repair to do on my old Vito so this will be really helpful. Excellent video too. Thank you
What did you do after you applied your paint? You sprayed another product what was it ?
Amazing 👍💪
I have an addictive personality so this is healtier than chasing strippers. Now I chase tools, buffers, sandpaper, waxes & polishes and most everything that takes 8 weeks to ship from China!
I followed the instructions to the letter...got my hair caught in the ceiling fan!
I have a sliver car and this the best video 🎉👌
What kind of primer was used? Adhesion promoter? Cause my bumper came out all bummpy. Looks great, but to the touch its bumpy.
I just wanted to check this out but in my lower economic country I can get this done for $50 haha
Great sense of humor.  Very good.
Beast
I followed his method precisely but when I removed the tape, some of the paint came off with it. How can I fix this without redoing the whole process?
Great job on the car and the video.  I am definitely going to do this.
Excellent job done. Thanks for explaining every step.
Where did you get your hardener?
Amazing video! I have a 2014 Cherokee, and could you tell me where to find the base coat, the primer and the clear coat?
I bought My 2013 Honda Accord EX-L Coupe with a scratch on it's back, and it's been 6 months sense I have it, and i can't get rid of the scratch, but i love my car
You could have used a duel action buffer to save your arms.
I just hit someone’s car and my car got the scrape. People who have tried this: please lmk if this works 😂
really good job!!
I too am Thomas. Kudos
did you use proper clear coat with reactor or just basic one?
Idk anything about sanding everything else seem pretty straight forward. I don’t want to sand my bumper off
I’m scared to mess it up even more and it’s 2 small scratches☹️
👍
Looks easy but this is not easy I did it and got bubbles and gritty ness on my paint :(. First timer here
There are many components to doing a pro job. One resource I found that successfully combines these is the Magic Painter Method (check it out on google) without a doubt the best course i've seen. Check out this  incredible website.

Would this work on a 2016 Maxima SV 300 hp with premium interior tinted windows panoramic roof cold air intake and Vossen wheels car? Not trying to flex just Asking for a friend 🤔
Well done, you can tell you're a fabulous kind of guy.  Stay fabulous.
You did a smooth job. As for me, I’ve leaned to be very very light on filler on deep scratches, and avoid on light scratches. And go very slow and wait patiently between paint coats to avoid paint drip lol.
What brand of paint did you use? It looks amazing!
Looks smooth  bro,  badass job and very fun to watch you got me cracking up homie.
You mentioned about mixing body filler and hardener. I don't know what's the hardener? I dont see the link to buy it.
wow, looks great
and he didnt have to paint the whole bumper.... perfect job

where did you buy the paint?
I’m so scared to try this, but I’m putting the things in my amazon cart as I type
good info but bad comedy, don't need that, painful to watch twice
Damn son. I need you to do that on my Camaro😭
Thanks for the humour I’ll do this when I’m done my bumper. I was doing clear and nicked the paint down to the primer(almost cried) what can expect I’ve never painted something this large before.
I did this and it saved so much money!!!!! Thank you for this tutorial! My car looks like brand new!! I fucked it up first time but second time I fixed it lmao 😂
Good savings.  I'm gonna do the same on my lexus nx200t.  They  charging me 1500,  I  spend 250 I will do a good job.  Thanks for sharing.
2 month ago i got 2010 Chrysler Town Country and it has the same scratches on 2 differently places and some of the paint are coming off. So thank to your video i have some idea on how to fix it. .
You should do mine haha 😆
That is the first stand-up comedy tutorial how to repair your car on youtube. Ive learbed and laugh my ass off hahahahaha
Excellent video.  Really helpful.  Petty funny bad acting and jokes. Great experience.  Thank you Sir.  I am impressed and feel lucky to have scratches and holes in my paint so i too may practice this art.
is the sandable primer the same color code as your car paint?
How many coats did you put on? C Base coat and how many for the clear coat?
Why did you go to the trouble to blur every brand name in this video?
That’s some garbage work 😂 sorry bro but holy shit looks so bad at the end 💀
I was gonna drop a like but then u dabbed or dapped or whatever. So now I am trying not to dislike.                     But nothing matters though
😹😹😹
Hey Thomas, could you tell us how much time it took you from start to finish?  Many thanks for the video!
Very nice e work, I'll be using this method on the scratches I have on my vehicle.  Thanks
I needed this I scraped the front of my rental 2019 Audi Q5 while my car is getting inspected I hope they don’t notice😬
Scotty kilmer would have a word or two to say about your car buying preferences. Could have avoided all these if it was a toyota. 😂
I have a black car can I still use the gray primer
Is the Sandable primer and Gloss clear coat included in the links?
Thanks for sharing Bro.  Gonna try this on my Tacoma fender.
Thanks
You have no idea how much this is going to mean to me. I messed up my car on a fence. Didn't realize how  sharp that corner was. Lol
This guy is a tru comedian! Lmassoff!!
The dab was proper and necessary comedic relief.
How did you know the exact paint color? Is that something you can see on the car?
What brand of paint/primer/topcoat did you use?
appreciate the video but you've just convinced me to live with the scratch i made on my car, lol - I'll stick with my viewpoint that cars with scratches are like men with facial scars - they add character
It only went and worked!!!   Thank you for making it look so easy and inspiring me to do it myself.  Now have a happy wife, and we all know that means happy life 😉🚗🥂🥇🇬🇧
Hello what products did you use? As well as which brand?
🤣🤣🤣 03:09 ..... rotf🤣 thank you for this!
awesome video great job and you're very funny too! :D
How many cans of base coat did you use?
Yo thank you for this vid! Now I can save money, the person was going to charge me almost 950 for almost the same scratch in my 17 Nissan Altima! Thank a lot.
Bro, is there any ratio of body filler and hardner?
Not perfect but okay
👍 good job 👍👍👍👍
i have soo much tiny scratches around my car. this is going to be a drag
I just followed the video on a 18 silver civic. Went well but had bad cloudiness on the transition. I tried buffing it and I'm buffed but the car still looks bad. I tried wet sanding and now I'm at the paint level. The new paint was rough  and looked a slightly different color. What did I do wrong?
And water,, Cuz it was hot 😂😂😂😂😂
How come you didn’t list the sandable primer you used?
thank you. where could i buy metallic beige paint  color and tools to repair dents in cars?
Man I can’t stop laughing u legit funny
I also want to save $675 !!
Now learn about plurals and stop attempting comedy
Not bad at all man.
I’m about to save tons of money and make a Side job out of this 😂😂
😂😂😂 he’s funny af
wow! do you have instaagram? id love to DM you a picture of my stratch before i attempt this haha
5:05
Awesome video you got yourself another subscriber!! I only have a question for you. I ordered my car paint and it came in 2 spray bottles, one says midcoat and the other base coat. Which one should I apply first  and how long do they have to let dry in between them? Thank you.
05:25 04:13 05:03
nice video...very clearly explained. Thanks!
So, where on line did you find all the materials needed for your project?
04:57 04:43 02:37
Can you send link of sand paper
When did you apply the clear coat on the bumber? Thank you for your video.
Hi there. I want to know from where you got the paint ?
Thanks man for the tutorial.. new subscriber here.
5:57 notice in the bottom left corner-ish where you can see the difference from factory and his work.
Me like, what you charge to do my car back bumper?
you made it look so good!  and pretty easy to fix.  I might try it on my 2005 jeep.  Thanks for inspiring me 🙏🙏
YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR VIDEOS IN THE FUTURE BEFORE UPLOADING .. SOUND VOLUME IS BARELY AUDABLE
You are really good at this - thanks for posting - way more complex than I imagined
Would WD-40 work in this scenario?
Great clip, I am yet to have a go. You should have sanded the old clear coat in the areas you did  not primer & removed wax. It is basically roughening surface for new lacquer to stick. [dry800 grit]
Lmaooo first of all I’m so glad I found this video bc it’s going to save me money & second of all I’m also glad bc you made me laugh you’re so goofy! New subscriber🙌🏽
Anyone know where I can buy that glass of water...... i got all the other materials online.
Fix my bumper
Lol love this shit! Can’t wait to try it, great vid
I get a 2012 hyundai accent car with lots of scratch. I searched YouTube for how to remove scratches and found this video. Lol😁
better pay 800$ rather than all this hard ass work and maybe you won’t get good results as a professional
Why did use a grey filter on the half of the image?
Why did you blur out the brand name of the paint products you used????
The water alone cost $100. The $20 was the rest of the supplies
I have an 2006 car, is the color being the same even if the code is equal? The other paint is old not recent like the one i am going to apply
Can you do minds , I don't think I get the same result
Thank you. Your video included all the information needed, and you were able to portray it in a short period of time, and with some humor. Thank you also for keeping your camera steady. Some YouTube videos are so shaky they make me dizzy.
I dropped my glass of water so threw everything away and order everything again
surprisingly a very funny and educational video.
I've needed this video for like 5 years. The scratches have finally accumulated to the point where I sought help. Thank you.
$120 bucks?  I buy a new one!  LOL
Yes Mate it was very VERY helpful ......Thanks Mate ....
Several mistakes, never spray vlear without paint hardening and wait 1-3 days before polishing, the paint at this point is extremely soft, high risk, easy to rub through the soft paint
Amazing, amusing and very helpful. Thanks.
Is that a silver color?
Nice job, thanks for sharing.
Hi Thomas!I’ve fixed the scratches like you have explain, but when I removed the painting tape I had a big surprise. Painting tape shadows make my work to look like s..t. How do I remove them?
Which paint did you use?
I could do this. But hard if you don't have a garage I'm afraid bugs pollen and crap will get onto it while its drying.
OMGoshh! Thanks 👍for sharing!!! Hope mine comes out as *_AWESOME!_* 🚖
Was hoping for a Hulk Hogan style posing of the “gun show”...probably rocking 10-11” pythons huh? Not to shabby..lol..in all seriousness it was a great video i thank you for taking the time to help everyone
Was this on metal or a plastic bumper?
Genius, I'm inspired 💙💋
Damn good job looks great
I WILL BE DOING THIS NEXT WEEK,,WISH ME LUCK!
I also tried this video and learnt the following adding to @John Lawson post.  1. You do not need a whole lot of car filler. I'm talking minimal amount needed. I put quite alot on as to make sure not to miss any areas and wasted about 4 sheets of sand paper trying to get rid of all the car filler.  2. ONLY place the tape on things you do not want to get paint on (Headlights, trim, signage etc). Even though it does not mention to do so in this video which is my own fault... DO NOT place any tape on other parts of the car body/panels as if to isolate the scratched area. I made this mistake and once removing the tape I had placed, I was left with tape paint lines which I had to sand down to get them back to the same level as the original panel paint. Basically I had layered too much spray paint on the area.  3. It says in the video but specifically for those who have never ever worked with sand paper, start on the rough sand paper (80 grit), repeatedly sand over the required areas and continue to sand the affected area's going up in grit each time. (Example. 80 grit, to 180 grit... to 800 grit... to 2500 grit etc.) Go higher in grit each time you go over the same areas, this will allow for smoother painting and you will avoid the grainy effect when painting caused by the rough surface of say 80 grit sand paper.
Hi where did you buy the paint spray basecoat color, gloss clear coat and sandable primer?
Hi Thomas, thank you for your video! Just one simple question : is there any requirements about the color of primer?
If you’re here I know you crashed like I did 😂
I have an orange car would I still use a grey sandable primer for it
I purchased the Bondo body filler which came with red cream hardener. Can it be used to fix the bumper?
Would you do the same procedure and use the same materials if it is on a metal surface of the car?
You better dab those scratches out 🤣🤣🤣
Amazing job, Thomas!  Hard work too. Very impressive. Regards from India. Stay safe.
what about the clearcoat ? great video by the way bro but was thinking like you going to clear coat it ?
Wow you did an amazing job!  My front driver corner looks somewhat like yours after someone got it with a shopping cart on my brand new X1.  Gutted but am scared to attempt this.  My paint is a grey blue colour and I worry it wouldn't match 100%
Just saw a car I love with low miles...but has a ding and light scratches ...I'm going to buy it
Thanks Thomas. I am first time painter. There were many issue came because I do not have any previous experience. It is a good experience.  Your video is too fast regarding how you can apply the the base coat and clear coat. I want to share my experience.  1.  It is not easy. It will take 2 to 3 days for painting and 1 to 2 days to gather the materials. I did not get sandpaper of 1500 or 2000 grid so I have used 600 grid sand paper to sand the primer & 1200 grid sand paper for base paint imperfection. 2. You don't need primer if you are repairing plastic part and for minor scratches. You just need body filler for deep scratches. Please apply plastic primer if you will paint the whole new plastic part or you have sanded too much and you exposed to the black plastic at many places.  3. DO NOT TOUCH TO THE BASE COAT AFTER YOU APPLIED. Remove imperfection after it dried by sanding 1200 or 1500 grid sand paper. Please take extra care while you sand for base coat imperfection on metal. 4. Apply clear coat under too much light otherwise it hard to find where and how you applied. My clear coat is little thinner. 5. After the clear coat you do not need compound if the surface it not rough. If surface is rough you can sand with wet 2000 grid sandpaper if you will get 2500 grid or 3000 grid that is better.  If surface is not rough than you can polish three times as Thomas suggested. It worked for me.
I've seen some autobody guys use a side to side sweeping motion for when they apply alll the P/BC/CC would that be applicable for this or would it not work without the spray equipment?
Its a great video and inspires me to fix my car scratches. Could you help me with the link to the body filler. I am in the Uk and could not find it on Amazon UK. Thanks
Did you paint the entire panel or just the area of the panel you repaired
Damn I gonna give it a try I just ask a guy how much to fix scratches and my bumper (front and back ) and he’s gonna charge me $950 😱  But this gonna save me $$ hopefully I’ll do it right 😅 Thks for the info bro
This is so amazing!!! Big help
Buffed mate!
New subbie here? Thank you for your video. I will save a fortune for the lesson I learned watching your vlog. Thanks a lot!
Good job Thomas. You make the whole process look as easy as ABC. Thumbs up.
Your positive attitude is infectious 👍 removing a dent today and trying this asap.
Just accedently scratched my dad's hell cat🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ kill me
Where do you buy matching base coat color at? Where to buy rattle can clear that will turn out like the clear on the vehicle?
Great job !!! Thanks
Informative
Whit 120 dollar you can pollish all your car in my country :D
Wet sand you base coat so the clear coat bonds. That clear coat will flake
Thanks for the video. It was hard to hear the audio w/o turning my speakers to max volume.
Very helpful video. You just saved me $800.
Someone scraped my moms red chevy cruze when I was parked. Looks almost exactly like the same scratch. I bought everything I need and I'm confident I can do just as good a job as you did. Only problem is the color . I cant find, Pull me Over Red in stores so I had to order it online.
Good job💪👍
where did you look for the basecoat, primer, and clearcoat? which brand did you use?
Wooooow! This is probably the most useful video on YouTube about auto bodywork 👍🏿. I am now encouraged to tackle my back bumper
How was the blending?
This is a great video Thomas thank you! No BS, straight to the point with a sprinkle of humour. I am under no illusion this will be as easy as you make it appear but I'll give it a go on my BMW having scratched it on garage entry.  Very, very tight corner so I'll probably be doing this over and over again but as the saying goes "Teach a man to fish and he will never go hungry..!"
great work, i try to do the same and equal result. nice video
Your jeep did not come out as glossy as the rest. Wondering what could help
Thanks for doing this video! But I messed up. The body filler wasn’t smooth at the edges so it shows and it’s rough and lumpy in some places. It’s already painted over though. How do I fix this? Do I need to sand it down and start over?
I saved £$£$ After my wife bumped in to the wall. Thank you
really impressive results!!! planning on doing this for my mum's VW Atlas tomorrow wish me luck
Love it great job
Well done
How do you get back up to that mirror shine from a factory clear coat? I seem to have a nice finish, just not like glass...moar buffing with polish?
Thank you I finally know what to do.
Can I do this in my driveway or do I have to borrow someones garage?
100 dollars my ass,you mean about 300 dollars,and it's 3 time harder that it look's on video,my dear friend.because i work every day this kind of job...
You did not even use that darn expensive dual action polisher whatever device and you did a good job!!!
Quick and easy: https://youtu.be/h2XDqyU_8EQ
Where did you order the paint
I loved the presentation of this video.
awesome , thank you.
this is helpful just need someone to help me. like your sense of humor😂.
OoYou oo Oooo
I’m too muffuckin tied after watching this. But ima try it💪🏽🤣😂
I don’t necessarily think there is a paint blending problem. What I noticed is the satin-ish finish that the clear coat gives. Not acceptable and it doesn’t change with buffing, in my experience.
Sandpaper and spray paint my car. This should come out perfect.
Did you buy a kit with all of that stuff or did you purchase things separately?
Super subject brother good job
I just scrapped the fuck out of my dads car😭
Wow, I am about to clean my new/old car first time in my life... I did buy one with proper quality scratch, and color is soo heavenly blue... further on I found dents and mini scratches, 6 exact. Car is 18years old but "forgotten in time bubble" my mechanic said, "first car in 20 years of his work looking like 1 year old"...yeeey...you inspired me. Now lets do magic. I am ready. Thank you for sharing your love, humor and wisdom. Gratitude 💜 zuzana
I just want to tell you thank you! Not only did you save me money but I learned a new skill and results has lead to me repairing others car
Very good
Unfortunatelly, save cost, but more effort 😂 but thank you anyway
My concern is the old clear coat and new clear coat not blending well, how can I ensure a flawless connection between them old and new?
It looks like you are using Automotive Touchup products. In your after shot of the area you did I noticed that the shine and clarity of the end result DOES NOT look at all like the paint and clear coat of the rest of the car.
Amazing work dude
what clear coat did you use?
yo can u just come do it for me
where can one go to find/make the paint color they need??
CEO of Buff Dabbing
Almost started doing mine without the glass of water. That would’ve been bad!
Fandabby video! Love your humour. I have many scratches and will do this. Thanks,
Dope video... never stop learning!
Please update the video for 2020 with the following: First step: put on mask and goggles. Second step: hermetically seal your garage against the outside world.
Does this work on metal body panels on your car?
Will this process work on the metal part of the car as well?
Where did you get the paint match and primer?
This is done on plastic yeah?
where is the link to the paint and gloss clear coat so we know what type to use
Just did the same thing to my car, but it turned out matte and not glossy at all, I think I didn't spray enough clear coat, so what should I do next ? Can I just spray another layer of clear coat and then do the buffing again?
You're good,  I'm going to   follow all the steps carefully.
Awesome 👍 Video!!!
I just hit my BMW on my driveway wall and it's scuffed up big time 😭
Can’t wait to do my car. When I was ordering my supplies I found out there are different color primers for your car. My car is a deep blue so I got the black rather than silver. Thanks for the amazing tutorial and cross your fingers for me! 🤞😁
Borrowed my friend's car and someone scratched it in the parking lot 😒. I haven't told my friend yet coz it's a HUGE scratch covering almost the all the driver and back passenger doors. Didn't even want to ask how much that would cost to fix professionally, so here we are! Can't wait to fix it and then tell him about it. Thank you so much for this!!
Amazing. Thank you for the video!
After i watched this video, i tried to fix the scratch on my rental car. little bit confused with primer, gloss, base color  but i learned alot from this video, thank you thomas!!
That was awesome thank you
Justvwhatvi wanted ,  I’ve just done the same type same area of damage to my Audi, Thanks very much for a no bullshit very usefull vid: cheers John In Oxford UK ,.
Thanks for the lesson. Good job.
I like your sense of humor! Great video - forget the water. You deserve a beer.
Thank you so much! This is just what I was looking for!
Where you stay will you do my car
Great video! Very helpful! One question though (it might be a stupid one), I see that there are 4 colors of spray paint primers (grey, red, white, black) on Automotivetouchup website you got your sprays, how did you choose the color? Thanks!
Did you use paint ? If yes where did you get it
Nice and informative. And funny too 🤣🤣🤣
Looks great! Did you clean it after sanding with alcohol or some degreaser before painting? Appreciate the humor!
After the cry he always do i subscribe
I'll give you $200 to do mine. LOL
We’re did you get your paint ?
This is going to be my next project during this lockdown.But I wonder if I really can find the color.Wish me luck!!
Very professional!
Great Job, man!!!
Im struggling to find this color. I live in canada and looked on Amazon already. Can you tell me where you bought your primer and paint? I also have PSC. I HAVE A JEEP COMPASS in sliver/grey
Cool instruction and direct to the point! Keep it up man!
That’s too much work a I rather pay
I don't have this exact problem but I subscribed because the vid was so clearly presented, and just the right amount of clowning around, imo.
Brilliant. It obviously takes work and good follow through. But what a huge savings. Well worth it. Thank you.
simple and easy to follow.. thanks heaps
Wow. Great instructions man. I have one question. I have a single smaller scratch on my bumper. If I use the Touch up paint from the dealer instead of the spray paint, will the sanding down process you described be affected somehow?
"i DABBED some compound" LMAOOOO ily
lmao a1 acting
How do this even happen on the very bottom front? Sorry new driver
why'd you blur out the brands of everything...
The best DIY video by far on utube. Short, straightforward, and funny. 🤣😂 Thx for sharing! 👍👏
Remember the water from earlier.outta nowhere lol i love it 😂
I tried this following this video. These are the important things I learned:  1. This IS harder than it looks. 2. Bondo (body filler) is only needed if you have deep scratches in the bumper. If your fingernail falls into a groove when you scratch it, it needs body filler. 3. The body filler’s only purpose is to fill the groove (deep scratch) so that it’s a level surface. You don’t need it anywhere else. 4. Less is more! If you spray too much of the primer, color, or clearcoat, it’ll pool up and drip. If that happens, there’s no turning back. DO NOT TRY TO DAB IT OR REMOVE THE DRIP. 5. Spray more layers of paint. The primer will show through lighter colors and will require a few more layers. 6. Possess a godly amount of patience or else.
Awesome but too many step ~ I'm lazy =D
Great job definite sub..
Ok looks easy enough for this girly to do hopefully lol !
I'm definitely doing this. I enjoyed your humor too.
Hey Thomas of all trade, thanks for this great video. There definitely are a lot of steps to go through - and a lot of different items to buy. My scratch is short but kinda deep - pretty sure it went through the primer as well. Can I get away with one of these small touch up bottles, then apply clear coat/polish and still get a reasonable finish?
To much BUFFering on this video
Nice job!!
So did you hit him or he hit you? Tell the truth!
Pure perfection!looks great!
thanks to the man who scratched my car
how ling did the whole process take? all the steps?  My car is very scratched all around and I want to know if it's worth getting into it or not, car being very old.  Thanks
What a legend
This is great and informative.
Who didnt like this video
You made that look rally easy. I am going to give this a try.....
My car has 4 scrapes on it because of the shitty (narrow) parking at my apartment.  I'm saving this for when my lease ends and I move the hell away from there (because I'll probably have more) 😅
Hi, do you have the link where you bought your spray paints?
Sir, what do you think of using hot glue instead of body filler ? Is it possible to use hot glue as body filler? Thanks!
Nice!!!
I think I’m gonna need your help
Is it any kind of sandable primer ?
Great tutorial! Best one ever! Educational and full of giggles !
You can go any maaco and get it fixed with 350$ in booth and use depont paint and clear.  Spray can it’s cheaper but hard to match color even if its same code and the cheap clear will god faded after few months  iam a certified painter dont do that funny thing on your car
Who df dis like dis video
Fuckin dope bro, amazing work and great video!!
Well hopefully this will buff up my scratches on my car 😪😭. Scared to do it but honestly don’t want to pay that much money when I can do it for cheaper
Wow Thomas, you are a life saver ! I put a 2" scratch in the wife's Regal bumper, after I got stuck in the snow and glanced a retaining wall. The collision place wanted to charge me $898 ! I followed your instructions and it came out perfect ! I spent $100 on supplies ! Thanks !
This is great!!! Thanks!
u shud put the tape first bro before do all the step
Thanks Thomas. I don’t know if I’d ever have enough confidence to do this kind of repair. I’ll let you know if I ever do it.
You should send this video to the body shop and ask 700$ the rest of unjustified money  from them
Luke!!! LOL
Aha, you have a great sense of humour. It's entertaining yet helpful. Thanks T.
Can I skip the filler step? 🤔
But without shine on this part.
It looks not too shiny as the original paint at the car doors. Maybe you have to vernice the paint after it all & wax it again
😂😂 I was learning and laughing at the same time, great stuff man!
Where r u located I m in NY can u fix my car
what is the thing u used to blend the colours called
Hi! This l did when l was young, 20 years young, to sell my first car. I needed fibre mats, too, cause there had been a wire near a tre to protect it, it was broken at one side and in the deep avening, close to the night, it damaged my car. I was nervous. But l took all the time it needed and after 2 days and nights my car was so beautiful l didn't want to sell it any more. But… l had bought my brother's car. Ok, l sold it. It was ok, my golf GLS with dark windows at the sides and at the heck. I'll never forget. My brothers before didn't believe me that l as "only a girl" could do all steps on my own. I could and then l really was a little proud of me. Tyour vid.freshed my knowledge up high to do it a second time. Now l'll be able to do it. Sitting in a wheelchair now makes it a bit different, but still it works. Slowly, but: lt works! Thank you! Be blessed!
Good shit bro! Like new
Very good tutorial.
Thank You Thomas !  I am on SS and my dealer wanted 830 $ to do a very similar scratch pattern on my car . . three days in shop ( they take off the bumper )  and three days of car rental !
I know several shops who can repair perfectly for me in dust-free room for $300
I am watching this and even saving this  video w/o having a car..✌😂
That’s garbage paint is going to fall off in a week looks good from far but far from good
Hey Thomas would you please come fix my car? I'm a girl and I can't do it myself.. Please help! 😭
How the Bloody Hell weren't you nominated for an Oscar for you Acting role? Racist Panel!!😂🇬🇧
This is amazing but I dont see it working for a car with glitter specs in the paint🤔🤷‍♀️
Looks easy enough for women to do.  Just scratched up my 300...mad as heck
will this process work for a black car?  im so fucking pissed right now I scratched my srt up im about to blow a gasket
I bought the same body filler..Did you mix in a separate bowl? Also I bought a clear primer for the base, the guy at the store said it works just as good. Is that okay? AND I sprayed another area with a clear finisher twice, since the person who did mine didn’t do it. But it still doesn’t look shiny like the rest of the car. I even put wax and a polish and it still looks the same. I don’t understand what’s wrong
Wow impressive.  I don't know if I can learn that. Lol
Excellent video!! Thank you..
You are not only funny, this was very helpful! Thank you so much, you saved me from getting ripped off!
Great job.
I'd already shit myself after he sanded it the very first time 😨
Great job ! I will try as I too have a jeep Cherokee that someone bumped into in that exact same spot ! Thankyou for your detailed information 👍
I am your daddy..... Wtf 🤣
Thanks I don't know where to find the colour code for my car .. now I can try to repair it..
When i search for body filler i see different type of body filler and it has different names, some of it has color, does the color matter or all of the body filler works the same?
Wow where did you get same  spray can colour
I wish i knew what brand you used for the paint, it would help with knowing what brand is reliable
Impressive Good Job!!!
hopefully after this project my arms would be buffed too😂 love that part!
Nice job
👍🏼
Wow, thanks a lot. Will definitely apply this video to my car scratch.
🤣😂🤣 yo this shit had me rolling!!!! Great video man!!!
Someone just hit my infiniti 😕 this video is gonna save me like $1k lol
After buffing my arms are now buffed! That’s why it’s called buffing!!! Hahahahahha
“When It dried I dabbed  (*dabs* ) some compound into the area”.... most underrated moment of the whole video 😂😂😂
Simple and straightforward
Hi, do i need to add clear coat?
Awesome video and very informative,  subscribed and liked.
The guy always has a future in bodywork.
Good video. It leaves me with the feeling of, hey, this may not be that hard and what have a got to lose!?!  ( other than several hundred dollars by letting someone else do it. )
Very Nicely Done!
Remember the water, I did not drink it.
Great job good as new
he made it look so easy...
Very helpful, thx.
your lucky.. i did this, got the paint code from inside my door...... and the paint looks a different shade to the car! stands out really badly haha
Nice job Thomas! Thank you for sharing. I've got a little job to do myself.
Wow, that was remarkable!
You're fucking good dude.
It does not apply to all colour paints though......why not show us on metallic paint jobs instead?
dab!
Great job, very helpful.
i think you need to put more clear coat. the after shot you can still see the difference between factory look and the area you painted
Lmao
Extremely good plus save money
My car door sticker doesn’t have paint name on it?
Not only have I repaired the scratches on my car, but I have also gained some buffing on my arms all for the price of one
bro I see fuzziness on the finished area you painted .your work didn't come out so good .just sayin ..that explains why you didn't show close up over all of bumper and rest the car paint at the end of the video , only from a distance outside
What if the car is glacia white ? Is it possible to find the colour for the car ?
I'll try this tomorrow. Thank you so much :D
That's it.. I'm sooo not visiting the workshop for car scratch fixing again...
good Job
Awesome tutorial! Someone parked too close in front of me and the two screws that holds their license plate tapped into my bumper. Now I have two minor paint chips. I was thinking of just getting touch up paint for 20 bucks.
Can the same materials and techniques be used on a painted plastic bumper?
Dude i rather pay $800 hire a guy like you to fix my scratches. Its too much work and complicated.
Who is watching this after they scratch they car 😂😂😂
OOO 🦾🦾🙌🏼
Good job and nice video.
Sir, can we use 1.2 ltr garden sprayer to spray paint?
Thomas - really impressive.  I have a few of these spots on my vehicle but too chicken to try - should watch your video a few more times.
This is amazing, I was quoted 800-1000 UK pounds for them to do my car. Il do it myself I think. Thanks for the video
Where is this guy based in ??
Nice work mate! Keep up the clean humor too! Good stuff.
Job well done, you should be proud of yourself. I enjoyed that & it gave me some tips. All the best.......
That was great Thomas and I don't even have any scratches, come to think of it I'm not even thirsty.
Thanks for Given an idea I have lots of scratches on my car. Means more buffing 🤔
Great job and good comedy relief.
Excellent tutorial video.  I am going to try this on my Subaru Wagon 2006 that has 30.000 miles.   You spoke clearly and gave great details.  Also enjoyed your humor.  Thank you.
😻🤙
Thanks man!🙏👌
invest the $ you spent in audio equipment
Eye-catching 💎⬆this
Fucking awesome
100% invisible scratches?
you can't do any of this where i live in UK, everything will either get wet while you're doing it or our garages at our houses are too small to get the car into work on it lol
Man,,,, all that effort and the paint start peeling off next season. For now, I just do rust preventative measures and forget about making it look pretty. :(
I enjoy watching DIY videos. This was a really good one!!! I am feeling quite relaxed right now for some reason, you have a mellowing effect!!! Thanks!!!
hi everyone ,if anyone else wants to discover car spray painting course try Alkarno Spray Paint Alchemist (just google it ) ? Ive heard some super things about it and my mate got great results with it.
That was a great job well done
You did a great job. How do you know what colour paint matches your car? Ingenious.
You did a great job! Awesome!
I just hit my car!!! Thanks men for the video, now I have hope!!
hey ,if anyone else wants to uncover car spray painting course try Corbandy Car Sprayer Crusher (just google it ) ? Ive heard some great things about it and my mate got great results with it.
Why there's so much buffing and sanding :(
Just a great video overall. Straight to the point, he does not go off topic and he also doesn’t add unnecessary content. Thank you for this video, I enjoy working on my car myself and saving money is an additional perk. Great job!!
Great job bro!!!
Too cute. I love your deadpan comedy. I subscribed due to your "cup of water" comment!
WOW! I wonder if I could do that too?
Great job, thank you
Absolutely gorgeous work!
Did it ever look as shiney as the original paint?
Hi buddy, very good video. How do i know what kind of sand paper and other spray coates to use for my particular car ? Thanks buddy.
Thank you for sharing ✌️🙂
Who else is here after hitting scratching their own car :/
Thank you!
I love this
Dude, you're funny thanks for making the video interesting than boring.
As a 20yr. Professional your wasting your time. That repair is garbage. Theres a reason we charge 800+.
haha My arms are now buffed.Nice video
Man! Man! Great! It work for my np300 navara 2017 model! Just like that? Wow! Amazing!!!!
Aside from the 3-letter paint code on the sill, how did you find the exact shade?  In my case, I need to repair a black bumper, but that model year came in two shades of black (very subtle difference, but still...)
Hey, nice job, man.
Hi guys.. just sharing..   https://youtu.be/ui9jHZFDnPc
Thomas, does anyone ever tell you how amazing you are?
Excellent Job! On both the car and the Video!!! Very entertaining. I hate doing bodywork but you have motivated me to try (rather than spend $500 - $800)
I mean, where can u find this kind of informative video and funny at the same time 😂 Thanks for the video 👌🏻
Nice
Awesome work bro. Really helped
What kind of water did you use?
The best instructional clip I’ve seen.Pity some of the others who spend more time talking than actually showing the process.
😆 does it also work on the body of a vehicle that isn't the plastic bumper?
Burn that  jeep  pure  lemons  in Australia. You should  have  a Toyota Landcruiser prado  for  unexplainable reliability. Jeeps are no better than Chinese cars there pure rubbish lemons
Panalo to!
Dont u have to repaint entire bumper.... to make it match
Great video. Thanks. :-)
Love it,   especially the 'shock and awe' part of getting an estimate from a body shop!
May I get pin comment
excellent video bro. loved the added humor
I'm going to open a scratch repair shop And I'm gonna charge 200$ to repair     No more jobless
Good video
After Buffing My arms are know buffed😂😂😂🤣
Great vid, thanks bro.
Dab with compound lolol
Nice job. Looks like you really know your stuff. It just looks very involved for an amature.
That's awsome I think I'll try it. But I'm curious, can you do it to change the color of your car? Or it's only for the same base color
big like and a new subscriber!
You’re funny!   Can you do my car too 😛
👍
WOW...you did a really nice job Dude! Probably better than the guys who were going to charge you $800. Kudos!
GENIAL!!!!!!!!
Price of glass of water???
Hi, Great! Do you get most car colors in aerosol spray, could you give me some suppliers names please-- Courtney
Great demonstration video,  Thank you for sharing. 👌🏻👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👋 🇦🇺
so impressive!
Thank you for sharing
How would you match the painted area with the color difference on the rest of a vehicle which is 5 or 6 years old? Weather and environment changes the original color.
You should watch to a video from Nasa. They show how they make a racket. You can do it. See you on the moon.
Great instructions. How do you go about finding the exact paint colour of your car?
hmmm I might try your way ,,,hahahah ,,it just takes time and some parts!! awesome!!
Informative and entertaining 😁
....and a glass of water because it was going to be hot....you crack me up! Hahaha
this is wonderful and your result is wonderful ... I fear messing it up because I have to work outside ... I was curious that you did not cover the wheel well or other parts of the car with a sheet or something, given the way aerosol paint travels in the air and lands all over the place ... well for me especially the outside breezes in FL can be random.  My brother did a great job on my Matrix a few years ago, looked like a brand new car even on the hood, and a few weeks later I totaled it, broke my heart.  Now I scraped my 2017 Jeep and need the courage to do all the steps you did because I want that kind of result.  Thanx so much.
Great video. Fantastic  presentation......Thanks
interesting points ,if anyone else is searching for how to spray paint a car at home try Corbandy Car Sprayer Crusher (do a search on google ) ? Ive heard some super things about it and my mate got excellent success with it.
Do you need primer? The automotive website keeps telling me to purchase along with the spray paint
Just a helpful tip, when you apply body filler, you MUST cover the area around the scratches as well. The reason for this is if you don’t do so(meaning if you only fill the scratches), when you go to sand it, the sand paper will dig out all the remaining body filler and you’ll be back to square one
Corny jokes, but they were funny.
Very helpful thank you
Great job!!! Thumbs up!
You are too funny!
Thanks so much and it looks helpful
Thomas of All Trades, Thank you so much for   creating this excellent video.   I shall definitely use this process to repair my car!  AWESOME Video!!  (:
You make it look easy,, I'll just take it to a body shop 🤦🤦🤦
Love the comic relief bro!
what do you recommend in terms of the age of the paint? i have a car of 12 years old and have the same problem
Can you list items needed , eg. different grids of sandpaper
PERFECT
The Respirator/Mask link is wrong
Beautiful work.
I found a local guy who repaired his paint of his white car by using Correction pen on his new Land Cruiser 😂😂
It is very nice to see how they do it. But the only thing is my local store don't the have the stuff that you had.
Good job!
Dang dude... Feels like too much work 😅 But thanks to you, I finally know the process
Just rub hard with brake oil and 80% will goo
super!
In UK, they normally charge £200/£250 to do that job.
you should go in  business of fixing scratches, in a mobile truck
Simple and easy to follow. Great video
That dab though. 😂😂😂
I am your daddy  lmao
Great job and commentary.
when are you freee?
Normally I groan at dabbing but that little one you snuck in there caught me off guard 😂😂 good stuff right here
Wow, good job!
Wow!  This came out great!  👌🏽 Great instructions!
I rather work overtime and pay someone else do the job professionally.
I love your video, thank you so much.🙂🙂
Great!!!  Video worth to watch!!!! I also wanted to do this to my car
Thank you po god bless
Bro..You and the truck look Good as Hell ! Thanks for sharing this amazing video!
Be like GUATAAAh...NAAHHH.😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
Good job
Should always try to buff out the scratches first ''
Good job fella,I’ve got a Citroen c3 too do.
Hi Thomas.  that is a great instructive video.  good humour (I'm Canadian) mixed with helpful instructions.  You did a nice job in the body work.
So I dont need to spray the whole panel for a repair then ?
Look good. Im doing my car and especially my brother's since I was at fault.0
It looks so good daddy
Wow great job! Thanks for sharing
孤兒的車子被刮那麼多次 你們然後說，沾一些研磨劑推一推就好了，這就是代表要孤兒自己摸鼻子自己處理。這個完全沒有憐憫知心，因為若你們發生小車禍，車子外觀受損，肇事責任都在對方，你們會自己回去處理一下就好了嗎？ 好冷血喔 世人間的忠信沒有了
Well done big man..and it looks the business aswell
Love your video super killer man!! The audio could use work for when your speaking to the camera like a lapel, but I’m sure you already know that you seem like a guy who does his research! Killer video again
I'm wondering how good it looks in person. Spray bomb paint job no color sanding to blend it to old finish
Is there a way to buy all the Things together?
Great job, and very funny  video too!
great work...
Hey everyone, the best success that I have ever had was with the Magic Painter Method (just google it) definately the most incredible info i've tried.
Diamond_hack001 on insta he got my stolen car
I have spent months researching into painting with a spray gun and found a great resource at Magic Painter Method (google it if you are interested)
I am ur daddy! hahaha.
I've been studying painting with a spray gun and found a fantastic resource at Magic Painter Method (google it if you are interested)
the greatest results that i've had was by following the Magic Painter Method (i found it on google) without a doubt the no.1 info that I've followed.
I have spent months researching into painting with a spray gun and discovered a fantastic resource at Magic Painter Method (check it out on google)
1:40 3:35 😂😂 Anyways i don't have a car so i wasted 6:22mins of my life ☹️
Best job I've seen on YouTube! I just scratched the hell out of my Crown Vic and was pissed off! Now I feel I can fix it thanks to your video! Had some good laughs throughout, thanks!
This is the best video I have watched in 2019. You have natural charisma and your job was awesome.
What about shiny metallic paint on cars? I hear that you have to blend the surrounding areas in a lot more however it may still not be the same shade.
You did a great job
Is that metallic grey?
Funny yet informative. Thank you!
Thanks for sharing your knowledge!
Stop stupid acting and come to the point
Voice problem
Please what color of sandable primer should be used on a toyota corolla; classic silver metallic 1F7 ? Kindly assist as i scratched my wife's car she's angry af !!!
Is it better to use a hand buffer when applying things? Or by hand?
no clear coat?
Had to turn the video off.. he was trying too hard to be funny.. really cheesy
Excellent video thanks
Hi, how did you manage to match the color of the entire bumper when you had just painted 1/4th of the right side.  There needs to be color correction.
Wow
You done your homework well...cheers🍻
Did you use a gray/silver spray too?
Amazing... back to normal color...
V
It looks alot better but i still seen dull over time that really wont last
Hey Thomas, great video, thanks for posting. Just experienced a similar (yet deeper) stretch on my 2018 Jeep GC. Question: where did you get the actual paint (original, from Jeep?). If not from Jeep directly, how did you know it was the correct color shade? Did you test it out in a smaller area of your vehicle first? Mine is the True blue pearl.
Nice Job !!
I learned something
great job, thanks for sharing this info
I scratched my mustang today :( I am going to attempt to fix it myself using the steps on your video.
good job, m gonna try on my car 👍
Thank you for sharing. Great job! I have one question, As you paint and add a clear coat over the original paintjob, did you noticed any trace at the junction? I'm affraid if I do that the added coats won't be aligned with original layers. Did you notice any traces or marks ? Thank you.
Very good thank you.
Hahah OMG... You are going from sandpaper 80 > 180 to 1500  ... Damn son... Im a carpainter for Living, and this is NOT way to do it..
Thanks so much for this tutorial!!!
.
Very nicely done.
Lmao awesome video
Thanks for the video.
Hahah this was so funny and informative. Im subscribing and going to fix my car.
I think u r a professional.
Way to go and save!!!!  Thank you.
Good video keep them coming 👌
Believe me, I'll go to the repair shop.
Believe me, I'll go to the repair shop.
Good man
Good stuff bro. Very impressed.  You made it look so easy and fun.
nice work..
Easy car scratch removing https://youtu.be/I1JO4GExJZE
Hey Man! Wish me luck! First time doing this... Will let you know the result
Which company did u go with to get the matching paint?
Good job man. Great result!
Thanks👍🙏👋
Wow thank you.😍
Cool video - very good :)
You're a Superhero, thanks for sharing your experience, I've learned a lot. Keep it up
Me - 😆🤭 Service Center - 😱😭
Fixing your own car is pure joy for many folks. even if its not perfect. Good job man. very good advice given in some of the comments. overall you did great pal.
Where can I get the correct paint ?
Love your sense of humor
This not a repair but rather a dressing to hide the damage. It wont last long. You see a lot of these repairs on used cars people sell from their backyards.
Can you list all the materials you use in the video below next time? Thank you this was really helpful.
Someone keyed my car and I was charged £100 to fix that by a well known franchise. Mercedes had quoted me £650 before vat. Considering that you say it will cost $120 which is equivalent to £100, I will pay to have the job done by a professional. But, this is a good video.
Superb work, and u are so wittyy
The most difficult process is to drink the Water from the Glass (3:35) when you are using that Mask (3:10) ... :p
Tho much work man.. bether pay and rust.
Well done
Wonderful repair
where is the shine on the panel you paint  its that easy than nobody needs auto body shops
Thomas....are you busy this weekend? :)
What paint brand do you recommend? How can I figure out a matching color to my car? I need to do this to more than one spot lol
Just like in Hollywood  !
If I have to put all that myself knowing me I would mess it up I rather go to a place and have it done or leave it alone 😜
after all that i bet you are more careful around objects! ha
That's a hole body shop fuck that
Nice job. A lot of work.
Great job - thanks for making this step by step video - I've definitely got a project in mind with the help of your video. To all DIY'ers - practice makes perfect - the more times you do this type of repair , the better you will get at it.
what a majic u have done ..great man 👍
A lot of painters and repair shop will lose their earning with this video! Lol
Good job!👍 it’s good you found the right paint color tho
In India it can be done in 5-6$
But still it can be identified it’s painted
Awesome
What city u in I’ll pay u an extra 200 to do mine
I m sure you are expert in this field. Maybe over 600 dollar or time you also lost. I think it is not good idea.
nice video it help me a lot 👌🏾
Nice
Very impressive work
Good job Thomas. I have a spot on my new old Citreon C5 to do and you have given me the incentive to get on with it. Thanks. Nick.
This is something I wouldn’t recommend anyone trying lol you are expert we would make Our cars look like a disaster but amazing work
Definitely subscribing
I'm so scuuuuurt.....!!! But my car is only 2 months old and it's driving me nuts!! LIGHT A CANDLE FOR ME!
Awesome job.
You lost me before you even finished the list products required to fix it myself. Here's my 800 bucks. Fix it.
😤😥😦😦
Wow❤ you are the don!!!👍👍
Great job! You saved money and learned something, then teached people!!
It’s ok man, you can tell us the brand names of the products, we won’t sue you. Also add the cost of the glasses and the mask 😷
I’m about to do this with my car, just recently bought my car of the market place, has quite a few issue, but I’m willing to dim  🙈 good luck to me lol  Good majority of everything, just need a few more things lol
Nicely done!  And thanks to those who contributed their advice to bettering the results.
Looks like a very good job well done!
boleh lah ko kelentung org yg tak faham cara sembuh cat
Good job....
Good job
Excellent video
I like this guy🤣👌
Sir I did subscribe your chenal.  Thank you for your gid me.
Sir what is your watsup number my number is 6200352136. I want learn auto spray painting.  I am from India. Please reply  Sir.  Thank you.
WTF is up with the sound? Are you under water?
Great job bro
Nice job, it looks good.  Enjoyed your humor too.
Nice job
Instructions unclear how to bring back this piston?
Pretty damn good!
You wouldn’t crash if you would just open your eyes
Hmm....radical. Looks good.
That was helpful!
Hey Thomas I have a large graze similar to yours in the video, on the same side too. Do you think a 2oz bottle of touch up paint will do for the job?
Will this work with factory paint on my car?
Very good job.
Thank you Thomas, i learned from you.
I didn't see you using the wax
Thanks ! But the hard bit is getting  the right shade of paint
Looks amazing man can’t beat the price also great work 👍🏿
Cool!
how does it cost 120 dollars I bought everything for only 60 dollars
a super job
Thanks bro now I can wrk on my car
Just scratched up my black car today, glad I came across your video. Thanks for the confidence, I'm going to try it.
great work!
Thank you Thomas great job 🤜🤛👍👌
Nice DIY, is bondo fill stage 2 ok or need stage 3? Your link takes to stage 3 in amazon
Great job! 👀
That looks amazing!
hey Bro.. pls give me the list of all tools and products
Nice Job  Thomas. 👍
Ok, I'mma do this soon. Thank sir!
That was awesome, had a great time watching, the results were on point with the original color.
Why didn't you list where you got the paint????  I also don't see a shiny top coat
There are several components to doing a pro job. One resource I discovered that successfully combines these is the Magic Painter Method (google it if you're interested) without a doubt the most useful info that I've heard of. look at this  super resource.
Cool
I got in a fight with a pole today and scraped up my drivers side door. It’s dented and scraped and I’ve been freaking out. I just bought it a few months ago. Don’t drive tired friends
YOU  can work att body shop😆😅😃💣
Wow great job! This was well done! I'll be doing this soon.
That was amazing!!!!
I better go to a pro and pay what he/she wants.
Lol u are soooo funny ,ur video was sooooo helpful.Gonna start on my tsx :) .
That was a good job!  Thanks for the helpful video!
Thank you Thomas.  I am shortly going to repair a scratch just like the one in your video   Your instructions were excellent.
Good luck with it last. It’ll peel off bcos u didn’t sand the clear coat. Must sand all cear coat with 600 grit paper before painting over.  Not just the scratches.  If u paint over it sand it!! Want stick or last
Good
U beauty😍❤️
Great job! I hope I can fix my truck. Someone in Boulder,  Nevada parked next to my truck and messed it up big time. I’m going to follow your instructions. My truck is dark grey. Thanks so much for your video.
Excellent effort.  Thanks.  HARE KRISNA!
Thank you my dude you save me lots of money I had some of the material already so mine was a little bit cheaper
Thanks
Thanks man
expensive.
It is very useful, Thank you so much for your video !!
I need a glass of water because I was horny and I know I need water to increase my stamina...how about that lol
Meeeh, I’d give the body shop guy $800, or a negotiable sum rather than do all this work. Damn, it’s tedious.
Dude your work is excellent, congratulations that is just like a professional job.  I do not know how long it took you to do it, but great work, well worth it. Your sense of humor is really lousy, but your paint job is great.
we have this problem in our car, want to give it a try👍🏻😊 thanks!
That’s awesome
Come to Norway and I will offer you a holiday stay if you do this work for my car, please.
It doesnt have the same finish as the rest of the car. It doesnt look shiny🤔  But it looks better than the scratches!
Great video! Thanks for the humor thrown in there too.
*DAB*
Very good video, I have similar scratches and am going to try this method. Thank you 😊
what website did you get the base coat paint from? I can only find touch-ups paint & it's not quite the color of my car😓
Your sound is poor.
Nice job!👍🏼
Is this materials are available in the what is the products name to use?
You're awesome! Thank you.
You're fucking awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love you bro i got a 535 and I brushed up against the bumper and now my alpine white has a doo doo stain on the bumper lol DIY!!!!!
Awesome bro, it helped me a lot. :)
Wow, a truly professional results if this was your 1st time, & economical $120 vs $800. Thx 4 sharing on the internet.
Hi nice video, you didn’t need to use adhesion promoter for the bumper? Thanks
Mannnnnnnnnnnnnn you HAVE to sand the entire area where your spraying otherwise the paint won’t stay as well it’s hard for paint to stay on a surface that is already smooth the paint should stay on the spots that have the body filler but other than that it’s going to look bad over time since it’s not as strong as if you sanded the entire area you applied your coat to
After going through all that haarrrd work...hope you didnt get scratched again almost immediately.
Well done Thomas,  Good job.
Great job!
Excellent job
Lol! You're such a goof 😂😂 I did however really enjoy this video and this was probably one of the better videos I have found to fix scratches!
Very helpful. Subbed
Is it true
Sorry, it was a typo. I was trying to type “your,” but accidentally typed “you’re” while “you’re” is used for “you are.” So, what was I trying to write? Your videos are excellent, not that you’re videos are excellent.
Wow!  Awesome ! U cant even tell that there were any scratches! Thank YoU!😂
Looks pretty damn good, I guess the paint is not blended great but it looks wayyyyy better than before
Anyone able to tell what brand paint they used after watching this? Or what brand did he use? Lol thanks in advance.
This is great
Bless your heart someone jackass hit my car and run away. I was really depressed. Now I feel a bit relieved after the video. I will do it after the finial.
Excellent work! You’re not only an excellent painter, but you’re videos are funny & entertaining as well. Are you going to finish that glass of water? Because after watching you’re hard working video, I’m getting little thirsty myself. Kudos to you!
Thomas the hack master and BS artist.
Come on people! There's a reason why it cost $800 to fix it! That's to do it properly, correctly,  to industry standards to match the factory finish both in appearance and durability!! Your repair isn't even close in those aspects. I don't think there was even one thing you did correctly not to mention spray can paint. Unbelievable the BS people are putting out there.
Oh Yea. Where's the close up showing how your repair compares to the factory finish on the fender?? About a 1 foot section, half of the shot is the fender and the other half showing your repair on the bumper cover. Your so full of yourself dude!!
Don't listen to anybody when it comes to this kind of thing unless they are a professional automotive painter and/or bodyman! These people don't know what they're doing or talking about!!
DON'T DO THIS TO YOUR CAR if you value it at all
I'm a professional painter and bodyman of 20 years. This stuff is hilarious! Why do you think it cost $800? The clear coat used by professionals can cost up to $400 a gallon! It's also catalyzed, which is what gives it it's shine and durability. That crap in the spray can is not going to hold up long. Like to see what it looks like now after a few months. This is just half ass back yard bodyman BS repairs. That's not how it's done by a professional so don't think for a minute that's how we do it or that those are the products we use. DO NOT DO THIS TO YOUR CAR unless it's just a beater car. If it's newer or one that you value at all DON'T DO THIS!!
Wow you did an amazing job! So satisfying!
My scratch looks just like yours!!!! Thank you! I'm going to do this. Would you advice someone who knows nothing about cars do this? Bc I know nothing about cars.
So awesome Thank you
Wow! I gave you a like and I subbed! To me this looks like a job done by a bodyshop.
Wow, very helpful, great instructions!
Excellent
Bakar nahin hai bhosdi wale ke awaz mein
👏 good job looks great
Thanks
Cool   :-)
Fantastic job 😎😍💝👍🌹
Ugly Mag rims
Great job, the car looks new again, thanks for showing us how 👍
Not only did he save money, but he learned a new life skill!
Nice now can you do my Honda Civic 😂
does this work for moppeds aswell?
the main problem for me is getting back the correct color to match the color of the car body.... how do i get back the exact color?
GREAT JOB AND GREAT VIDEO
Cry a baby ha ha
Good job man.im now subscribing you
Body shop wanted $500 for one scratch in the rear quarter of our car. That was while they had it to replace the entire rear bumper cover. I knew they already needed the paint and had to do body work to the rear tailgate, but it was still $500. I told them never mind, I will adress that scratch myself. Damn crooks. I told them if they didn't want to bother, that's fine, just dont attach an Ultra high number onto the job just because they didn't want to do it. I won't be using that body shop again.
Can you fix mine?! Lmao 🤣😂😭
Hey my friend .!.!!. Make a video to fix dents .!.!.! I really need to know how to fix a dent .!.!.!
It costs $100 to repair in my country
Great video. very simple to follow.
would have been good to discuss how to blend the edges of the painted surfaces with the rest of the car.  you did not mask a complete panel.  Body shops I have gone into have always said you have to paint a whole panel otherwise the new  paint will not look like the old.
Did your car have a deep scratch ?
Hi, I have a Mercedes and on the door is a scratch about 1 millimetre deep. Can I doing by this way? Excuse me , my English is not so good 😊
Exactly what I needed to fix my scratches 💯😎
I would do for much cheaper .
Perfect! Also 😄 funny!
Thomas that was awesome. Thank you so much.
Thanks for the video unfortunately mine is the wing which is quite ripped off and isnt fibre. Any online shops where I can source for a Citroen C5 2012 wing/fender?
Good s#¡+ Thomas! Informative,practical and we'll explained. Mahalo 🤙
LoL, plus 1 glass of water 😁 because I was thirsty 🤣

Cool video, I'll use it as reference with my car. Just as a recomendation, try to increase the audio volume, I could bearly hear.
Great job man, now I know how to do it on my van, thx!
Thank you so much for this!
Hello how long does it take to fix it, I mean upto the point of putting the right color of the paint before letting it dry overnight. Thank you

Good job bro. I have a couple little spots I need to do. Thanks
You really should be using a flat block with that paper.

Omg! You are good!
Genius
You’re so funny!🤗 thanks for the video
Good job mate...
Does it leave it with a smoother finer finish if I were to sand up to 5000 grit? I plan to don  ‘12 bmw 528i bumper. Thanks!
After watching this video I went to the gym to get my arms buffed 💪💪💪💪 ..... Next video: how to get work on your abs😂
😎
Kudos!!!!!!!!!
Serieux ,,, stun cave solide se limiter ,, connait rien dans le body
It's still a jeep tho
I'm Impressed. Great job.
I think the link for the wax is incorrect,can you put it again please and thank you
Watching your repair video before taking on a project like it makes this far less intimidating for me. Thanks!
Very Nice
Looks great!..Nice job!..,👍🇺🇸
Looks like a great job.
HELL YEA!!!!
I just paid $100 for that much of area to one of the bodyshop guy i know, he did it for me.
I scratched that same area to my chevrolet but they are really deep and I’m afraid to try this and mess up ... I know nothing about cars
Muy bien chinito eres vien chingon
Thanks for that Lesson.  Great job
HELL YEA!!!!
Wow
I detail car's for a dealership. Your method is pretty close to the way I do it daily. The only main suggestion I would like to suggest is that there is a product called fade out. It's used after your clear coat. When you spray clear coat on a car surface it leaves a halo around the area you sprayed. It's from over spray. In and usually is little hazy. Spray the fade out right after the clear and it blends your new clear coat perfectly into existing.
Awesome video, will help for sure, arigato godaimasu
Pretty awesome job
Good
Investment 120 dollars willbe charge 200 doller so profit 80 dollars
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣" I also needed a glass of water ". That was killer dude 🤜
Nice project..
Good job but next time u can save money by using only 400 grit sand paper for the wet sanding and it will come out nice nevertheless u were patient with the job and that's awesome
Great job!  I need you to do mines, I’m to scared to do it myself
Good job but ain't totally creatively painted u can c how much the rest of the car shines but were he worked on it u ain't got that shine.stil worth doin ur slef👍👍
I just did the primer and started base coat today... on an Obsidian Black Metallic 2009 GL320 (exactly the same kind of scuffs/damage)...  it is MUCH harder than I thought it would be.  A few people have said not to go beyond 400 grit wet-sand on the primer but I had to hit the brakes when it became obvious that the texture from that grit was not even close to being covered with the base coat. (assuming because of the color) I'm going to pull it off with 400 and go to 600 then 800 and try again tmro...  I guess as long as you dont get as far as the clear coat you can kinda have a do-over... ugh. I need this job to be finished!!!
Great instructional video and easy to understand and follow.  I will refer to this for future reference.  good job man.
Hi Thomas I am working in MNC  carpaints  supply company tail gate part more in wanted  to be erase total paint removal process is any give me suggestions
The bad things was that you make the space to repair bigger that it was... I think there are method easer than this one to remove your scratch. You should do more research before do it.
wooooow!!! Man!! you saved my life.. car! I was about to search for a paint for my car. And you explained good how to find it! Going to repair my scratches on my Ford Focus 2005!
My car has those types of scuffs thanks going to do this
You are literally the ONLY person on YouTube that has listed the products and explained everything in layman's terms!! Thank you sooo much! I wish you many many more subscribers because you really deserve it!!
I LOVE YOU!!!!
Damn really great tips and hacks, awesome
Good job! You've just saved me a couple of hundred dollars 🤸🏾‍♂️
My car has deep deep scratches and I can’t afford to spend 800 dollars so I’m just gonna have to do it myself. My car is old anyways , 2002 Toyota Camry , so it’s pointless to get a full body paint job at Maaco.
Where did you get the spray cans?
Great job!!
after reading some suggestions here in the comments do i 2500 grit wet sand RIGHT AFTER applyingthe clear coat or A DAY AFTER and tthen adding the compoundpolish then wax? thanks for the help
Good DIY
Gud
For wet sanding did you use hot water or cold water,Also what you mean by ferm pressure?
Damn
Great video. Thank you. I have subscribed.
Thanks
you can use bondo on plastic?  I thought another product was needed..I am assuming these bumpers are not metal..?
Was the glass of water $20?
I want to do it...but I'm scared. Anyway it's a great job and very helpful
Awesome video. Just straight steps. Not 30 minutes of extra narrative. Couple of questions:  How much labor hours should a noob expect to devote to this?  Can it be done over multiple days or need to do all at once?   How long before you can drive in bad weather with the paint?  How can I tell of the auto body shop will do all the right steps? I was hit and they insurance is paying for it but they did they would have to take off all sorts of parts to do the work and do the whole door not just the scratches otherwise it shows. Afar watching you I have to guess there's no way they do it as thoroughly as they say when it can look awesome without all that extra labor..   Lastly any idea how much insurance tend to offer compared loathing for the work? Maybe I take the cash and do it myself?
Hard to believe after all these years we still use Bondo.  That was used in the '60s for sure.
Hi guys i sanded with 180 grit and alot of scratches appeared, how to remove those scratches? And also what to do with over sprayed paint around the area? Thankss
Man, you did very well. Awesome job!
Cool now I just need to scratch my car.
Great video man. 👌🏻
That dab 😂 you a fool lol. Great video
Now just clean that brake dust.
I just tried this and i clipped my wipe off arm with my buffing arm and tore my finger apart and also my right arm is bigger then my left. Loved the video
May want to invest that money you saved in a better microphone.
$800 to repair it professionally is no much.
I am a women and don’t know anything about cars I just crashed my car 2 days ago and what to try this where do I buy all the things ? 😞
Awesome
Nice job.  ++++
Don't waste money , unless you want to sell it , hahaha
In india same size of scratch got done in 5$
looks great!!! can you do mine now!
great job man, thanks for sharing this video
What is the name of the body filler you used?
Thank you very much. I found this video very helpful. I'm going to try this.
Good job man(: but avoid loughing like a baby(: yo re getting older(:
Bro, I owe you big time ! A shovel flew off a pickup and smacked my Charger lower bumper. Because of you, it’s almost like new. But, what can I do if clear coat looks a lil rough in a couple areas?? Thanks
Change that cold water for a cold beer 🍺!!!!
Ha ha in Pakistan you can get this job done by a professional just for 20 dollars 😅
Great job!!!
well that was quite a bit of cringe
Amazing!
I am very nervous about trying this on my 2009 Mercedes.. But I gotta sell it and dont have the $$$ for the shop. I don't know if someone asked this already but how long did it take start to finish? I'm going to need to "borrow" a friends garage to do it.
My car got hit in the exact same spot like that 2 days ago. I can't afford to go to a repairer, so I'm going to try it myself. Saw a family friend do it to my Dad's car many years ago and it didn't look hard. Thank you for posting this. I enjoyed the humour as well. lol
Very helpful,thank you!
Even though this video was super cringy it was informative. Thanks.
If my primer is also a filler, do you think I would still need bondo? I can email/text pics if you’re willing.
Thanks for a great video.  You gave good information and the camera had a good view of the work!
More people like you please! Thank you
Don't you need the sand the base coat after spraying it on before spraying on the clear coat?
Even this skinny old 64-old-year old broad can do this! Running to the auto store for my supplies. THANKS!
Nicely done. how does it look up close not through the camera?
Cool!
Crazy, my 15’ Jeep Cherokee has that same scratch and a dent left by a truck that bumped into me  and fled, was looking for a way to fix and lo and behold! Thanks man!
Omg so good! So helpful!
How much time did the whole process take you?
The joke about the glasses of water made me subscribe. Very funny man! :D
Soooo  after 10 years of driving a small hatchback car I thought it was a great idea to upgrade to a big SUV with an extended front. I haven’t even had a suv two months and today I was pulling into a parking spot and smoked the persons car beside me. COOOOL! It definitely looks like this with the deep scratches and all these autobody places are telling me I need a new bumper or I have to paint the whole thing or other people are telling me to just polish it and I think I need more than that who on this thread is in Toronto Canada and wants to help a sister out LOL
What’s the name of the exact product brand you used?
Hi kuya pa PM lng Po sana aq Kung ano yung mga list nung mga dapat bilihin..I check Po kasi sa automotivetouchup.com ang dami nman po klase ei hindi q Po alam yung pipiliin q...thanks kuya awesome video 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 God bless
കൊള്ളാം 💙🇮🇳❤️
If I can do that, I can able to open my own body shop .
Amazing video
if only it were that easy
Wow
Super bro
Bro Thomas, Where did you buy aiuto paint from ? Thanks
Thank you Bro Thomas 👍🙏
Your voice would be great for, “Snatch the pebbles from my hand Grasshopper.”  But really your vid was pretty good and informative.  Thank you for sharing.
Fake ! Sekend colors
5:05 no
Awesome Bro
nice job, where did you buy auto paint from?..........
Pilipino ba kayo? Ang galing!
You could've used the bodylines and cover everything up to them, especially those of the fog-lights . That way the transition lines would be even less visible.
to spend that whole things.. better to buy new bumper.. lol
what about a different of color? i mean a red blossom color, or a green shallow ocean color, that's hard to find a ready made aerosol paint.
Good job could you come over to my house next ?
VERR NIICE !! Now get on to the rest of the vehicle with the polish.. and have a sandwich ready. Good job!!
That was AWESOME! Thank you
Can you link the paste you used to fill the dents?
What about 'pearl' paint colors? Does that have to be done differently?
I'll pay the 800 and then watch Netflix
Great job looks really good
Ok i will pay 800$
Nice video.. And great after tips from the public.. However, is it me, or does the finished job seem to not have as much the same gloss as the rest of the car's bodywork?
"I also needed a glass of water" 😂 this guy is great
From my Profecional perspective you did a crap job that shit will start to pull of in a few weeks.
Nice job
Nice Job!
Great video I learned a lot do that with my car
Good job
2 questions, sir: 1- What happened to that glass of water?  2-Does it have to be a distilled water, or just a tap water? Nice video bro., and a beautiful sense of humour.
Good job champ I'm a try
Looks good.
Great job!
Haha when you dabbed the compound
Awesome job man! Funny stuff too. New subscriber here. Thanks for the tips.
Do you use spray clear after finish painting?
Great video too. Very helpful
"I am your Daddy" haha... love it!!!
Nice Job man. If I could give two tips it would be stop sanding after 600(metallic) or 400(solid) grit. The base needs something to stick to! Going to fine will not allow enough mechanical adhesion for the basecoat to bite into causing future adhesion problems.   Another tip is look into the “spray max 2k clear coat”. It comes in an aerosol can that you activate. This will be far better than the 1k clear used. It will last just as long as professional shop clearcoat against UV.
How did it turn out? I’m referring to the color / clear coat.
Good job!
I got same amount of scratch on two partitions of my new car. I have no idea how I can do what you said or if the materials are even available near me
Dude that was Dope mad beginners Skill !!! Or have U done this before ???
Nice tutorial sir, hope u can give me the things that you used so i can fix mine. Please and thank you
Looks good to me. 800 dollars vs 100 dollars. I vote to keep the 700 dollars in my pocket. Thanks for making this video.
Came out pretty nice!
Why you didn't sand wet?
Upgrade to a better Mic
Looks good !!! Good job
Nice job and video
Anyone try this on a mercedes?
Thanks for making vid, have to do on my vehicle
Gonna try this out for my Silverado, hope it works
The final finish is different than the rest. You should have used 1500,2500 grit sanding + compound + polishing + wax to get the finish.
It turned out great.  However a couple of things to note.  You should not have used anything greater than 600 grit sandpaper before applying base coat.  You want some scratches so the paint will grip.  400-500 grit is also fine.  The 1500-2500 grit was totally unnecessary and will actually hurt the durability of the paint.  Next time also use a flexible bondo product for bumpers.
Nice work
Where did you get the paint for the your car
Great video!! Tks for sharing... just subscribed 👌🏻👌🏻
Wow!
Very nice video.
Great job.
You need to put a coat of wax after the polishing step to offer the paint some protection.Polishes and compounds are abrasive and are often mistaken for wax.
Very nicely explained, well done.
Imaging video, Thanks for uploading it,  I will also try to paint 🎨 hope if I can do 😂
It’s not gonna last
Dang you went all in with that sanding, you can usually stop at 800 for primer.  Nice job
What face mask and goggles do you recommend to purchase as seen in this video?  Where did you purchase all the supplies used for fixing the repair? Thanks for the video!
Best video on scratch repair so far! Thank you!
https://youtu.be/FvrJEsFhAQ4 please subscribe thanks
Thanks
nice job looks great thank you for the video but the only thing that was weird that you should have sanded it with 2500 at the end and then polished it I'm not busting on you, you did awesome job just a thought
So after u clear coat, u don't have to sand back clear coat to use compound on it??
Nice tutorial, I'll use it to repair scratches on my silver impala. Thanks for sharing.
Okay well wish me luck cause I have no idea what I’m doing
Bruh... keepin your head above water makin a way when you can... Goodtimes  👏🏽
Nice
Can you link everything you used?
What happens at 4:17?
I am very impressed!  Thank you for sharing - I am not so afraid of fixing my scratches now.
Amazing video. I like DIY things.... but main problem is that, How to get exactly the same colour spray paints......???
Good job, I know it ain't easy
Awesome video
Is this the same process that repair shops follow?
I am too poor to have my own car why am I watching this video?
"I also needed a glass of water" when i say I am DEAD
I didn't think I could get good results on my bumper, but the paints today are so much better. These steps are exactly what I followed and I am very pleased. Nice job!
Tnx bro because of ur useful video 👍🏻
Where did you bus those products?
Bull shit
$800!!!  Nhaaaaaaaaaaaa   😂😂😂
the micro fiber towel should be clean，right？can i ask is this really the first time you do this? seems like an amazing job!
Curious to know how the paint/repair looks since you did it? Any fading?
Great video. Gonna try this tomorrow! Do you know if I can use a wax instead of a polish? Or can i use the wax after the polish?
This is a great video! I have seen this process done with fewer steps and fewer materials for a slightly less thorough finish, and this video is a more complete approach.  From my observation, I wonder how important it is to sand the primer enough to ensure primer is not on good existing clearcoat.
This is actually and easier and straight to the point tutorial, much better than the rest I saw. Deserves more likes and views.
“After buffing, my arms are now buffed, that’s why it’s called buffing.” 😂
Just scratched a rental. Fixing it before I give it back.
Sick
Great job.  I didn't know OE paint was available in a spray can.
Do I stay in LA? I'll pay u to do mine. I have a very similar scratch but not as bad as yours
Good job. Will attempt my scratch now
A school bus rubbed the side of my 2017 black Lincoln MKC and the scratch is smilier to this one. I want to try and do it myself but Im nervous as hell to try... This video makes me want to try it cause I know they are going to want to charge me an arm and leg to fix it
i thought it was a mustang the whole video because of the light. nice dab
https://youtu.be/g5T3-7-p6Pw Does the scratch remover cloth remove scratches from vehicles?
I literally have a scratch similar to that on my 2013 ford Taurus.. Its a weird green color n i just found out Its called ginger ale metallic . scared to try and fix the scratches myself😥 guy tried to charge me 1400!
Impressed
WALANDYO!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing!!!!
